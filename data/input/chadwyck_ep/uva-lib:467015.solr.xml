Scene I. —A Street in the Suburbs of Ghent. The Lord of Occo, meeting Sir Simon Bette and Sir Guisebert Grutt. Occo. Sir Guisebert Grutt, and, by my faith, I think Sir Simon Bette too! Pray you pardon me; I thought that you were sped upon your mission To treat for peace at Bruges? Sir Simon. Sir, in good time. We'd have a word with you before we go. You are a noble born, my Lord of Occo; And let me tell you, many marvel much To find a gentleman of so great worth A flatterer of the Commons. Sir Guisebert. Yea, my Lord: It looks not well when nobles fall away One from another. That the small-crafts here Should lift their hands against their natural Lord Is but the plague and sorrow of the time, Which we, that are of credit, must abide: But ne'er till now a gentleman of name Was found amongst their leaders. Occo. Oh, dear Sirs, I could remind you how your sometime selves Bore less goodwill towards the Earl's affairs Than spurs your errand now; and if to you Pardon be promised, I would fain be told Why not to me as well. Sir Guisebert. Truly, why not? To whoso merits it 'twill freely fall; So give us leave to make a good report Of how you stand affected. Occo. You are kind, And I am nothing loth. So please you, say That I am not of them that evermore Cry out for war, and having not a hope Of the Earl's mercy, act as desperate men; For were I sure the many would be spared, It should not then behove me to stand out For my particular ransom,—though, to say truth, The Earl should get himself but little gain Were he to deal too hardly with us all. Sir Simon. 'Tis fairly spoken, Sir. When we come back, Bringing conditions with us as we trust, We'll ask your aid amongst the Commons. Yea, For truly there are here a sort of crafts So factious still for war and obstinate, That we shall be endanger'd. Suing for peace Is ever treason to the White-Hoods. Well, We'll look for your support. Occo. In me, be sure A friendly overture shall find a friend. [Exeunt Sir Simon Bette and Sir Guisebert Grutt. Van Aeswyn comes forward. Aeswyn. My Lord, were those that parted from you here The worshipful negotiators? Occo. Ay! Would they had pass'd the windmills—how they crawl!— And met no babbling burghers on their way. Aeswyn. What! you have made an offer? Occo. No, not so; I've flung my line, and yonder pair of hooks Are aptly baited to ensure me one; But I am not, nor mean I to be bound, Till it be seen if yet my suit may thrive With yon fair frozen dew-drop, all that's left To represent Van Merestyn's hot blood. Aeswyn. 'Tis said she is but backwardly inclined To any of her swains. Occo. Such wealth as hers Makes a maid whimsical and hard to please. She that can have her will, be what it may, Is much to seek to settle what it is. The damsel must be tried; for if she yield, The charier must I be, whilst times permit, Of the good town's goodwill. Her lands lie all Within the Franc of Ghent. Time presses now, And I must press my suit. This very hour I bade her to expect me. Forth we go. Scene II. —The House Van Merestyn. Adriana Van Merestyn and Clara Van Artevelde. Clara. I do not bid you take him or refuse him; I only say, think twice. Adriana. But once to think, When the heart knows itself, is once too much. Clara. Well; answer what you will; no, yes—yes, no; Either or both; I would the chance were mine; I say no more; I would it were my lot To have a lover. Adriana. Yours? why, there's Sir Walter. Clara. Sir Walter? very good; but he's at Bruges. I want one here. Adriana. On days of truce he comes. Clara. I want one every day. Besides, the war Ne'er slackens now; a truce to truces now; And though on moonless, cloud-encompass'd nights He will, in his discretion, truce or none, Hazard a trip, yet should he be discover'd Mild Van den Bosch would pat him on the head, And then he'd come no more. But ponder well What you shall say; for if it must be “no” In substance, you shall hardly find that form Which shall convey it pleasantly. Adriana. In truth, To mould denial to a pleasing shape In all things, and most specially in love, Is a hard task; alas! I have not wit From such a sharp and waspish word as “no” To pluck the sting. What think you I should say? Clara. A colourable thing or two; as thus: My Lord, we women steer not by our hearts, Nor yet our judgments, but the world's loud voice; And though I prize you dearly in my soul And think you of all excellence made up, Yet 'tis a serious and unhappy thing To hear you spoken of; for men protest That you are cruel, cowardly, and cold, Boastful, malicious, envious, spiteful, false; A bull in ire, an ape in jealousy, A wolf in greediness for blood. Adriana. No more? Am I to use no courtesies but these? Clara. No more? Yes, plentifully more! where was I? This for your mind's repute. Then for your person, (Which for my own particular I love,) 'Tis said that you are hideous to behold; Your brow as bleak as winter, with a fringe Of wither'd grass for hair; your nose oblique, Pointing and slanting like a dial's hand; They say the fish you had your eyes of laugh'd To see how they were set, and that your mouth Grows daily wider, bandying of big words: All which imaginations, good my Lord, Grossly as they may counterfeit defect Where worth abounds, are yet so noised abroad That in despite of that so high esteem In which I hold you, I'm constrained to say I'd sooner wed your scullion than yourself. Adriana. Thanks for your counsel; cunning is the maid That can convert a lover to a friend, And you have imp'd me with a new device. But look! Is this—no, 'tis your brother's page. Clara. All hail to him! he is my daily sport; Of all things under heaven that make me merry It makes me merriest to see a boy That wants to be a man. Adriana. His want fulfill'd He will not be the worse; 'tis well for them That have no faults but what they needs must leave. Clara. Are my faults of that grain? What faults are mine? Adriana. Perchance I err in thinking that I know; But grant I know and err not, 'twere not wise To tell you. Many will beseech their friends To tell them of their faults, which being told, They ne'er forgive the tellers. And besides I've heard you oft confess them. Clara. Well, I own There's a main difference betwixt faults confess'd And faults arraign'd. We tell ourselves our faults, And at ourselves ourselves take no offence, For we are well assured we mean no harm; But should my friend accuse me of the like, Though I had charged him to be blunt and frank, I seize him by the throat. Enter the Page. Sir Henry! Ah! 'Twas you I dreamt of; whither away, brave knight? Page. I'm coming but to pay my duty here; The lady Adriana lets me come. Clara. I wish thy master knew it. Page. So he does; He tells me to come too. Clara. Alas, poor man! Has he no eyes? Page. I know not what you mean. Clara. Why, when our pages steal away our loves, Tell gardeners to keep blackbirds. Look—look here! See you this drooping melancholy maid; What have you done? Page. Who, I? it was not I. Clara. Who was it, then? Well—“kissing goes by favour”— So says the proverb; truly, more's the pity! Yet I commend your prudence, Adriana, For favouring in place of men and monsters This pure and pretty child. I'll learn from you, And if, when I have kissed my pug and parrot, I have the matter of a mouthful left, For fear of waste that's worse, I'll spend them here. Page. I would advise you to be more discreet. Clara. So-ho! and wherefore? Oh! so old you are! Full fifteen summers older than your beard, And that was born last week—before its time. I told you, Adriana, did I not, Of the untimely birth? O' Wednesday 'twas, By reason of a fright he gave his chin, Making its innocent down to stand on end With brandishing of a most superfluous razor. Adriana. You told me no such tale; and if you had, I should not have believed you; for your tongue Was ever nimbler in the track of sport Than fits for hunting in a leash with truth. She is a slanderer, Henry, heed her not. Clara. Ay, no one marks me. I but jest and lie, And so must go unheeded. Honest times! Slanders and jests have lost the ear o' the world! But do I slander him to say he's young? Page. I am almost as old as you. Clara. I grant you; But we are women when boys are but boys; God gives us grace to ripen and grow wise Some six years earlier. Thank Heaven for that! We grow upon the sunny side o' the wall. Page. Methinks your wisdom grows o' the windy side, And bears but little fruit. Clara. What! malapert! It bears more fruit than thou hast wit to steal Or stomach to digest. Were I thy tutor To teach thee wisdom, and beheld such store Of goodly fruitage, I should say to thee, “Rob me this orchard.” Then wouldst thou reply, “Five feet three inches stand I in my shoes And yet I cannot reach to pluck these plums, So loftily they flourish!” God ha' mercy! Here comes the Knight upon an ambling nag. Now, Adriana! Adriana. I am sore perplex'd. What shall I say? Clara. My counsel you have heard, And partly slighted: wherefore seek to better; Take we direction from our full-grown friend. Henry, a Knight will presently be here To ask our Adriana's hand in marriage: What shall she answer? Page. Let her say—“My Lord, You are the flower of Flemish chivalry, But I have vow'd to live and die a maid.” Clara. A goodly vow! which grant her grace to make, So it be not too troublesome to keep. But he's no more the flower of Flemish Knights Than you the pearl of pages. Adriana, Bethink you of your answer; have it pat, Lest he surprise you and you speak the truth. Adriana. Prithee, what truth? There's nothing I would hide. Clara. Except, except—yes, turn your face away That so informs against you. Here he comes. Enter the Lord of Occo. Occo. Fairest of ladies! an unworthy Knight Does homage to your beauty. Adriana. Good my Lord, If 'tis to beauty you pay homage, here You see it less in me than in my friend, A daughter of the House of Artevelde. Occo. Fair damsel, I am happy in the beams Which shine upon me from two spheres at once. Clara. Fair Sir, I thank you; you're as true as brave, And there is none in Ghent with ears to hear Who has not heard recounted night and day The exploits of Lord Occo. Occo. On my soul I blush to hear it said; though true it is I have perform'd what little in me lay To bring renown to Flemish chivalry. I give to God the glory, and, next Him, To her whose charms would fire the faintest heart. Clara. Whoe'er inspired your valour, your exploits Must give that lady high pre-eminence. Three hundred men-at-arms, I think it was, You freely fell upon with sword in hand, After the storming of the fort at Sas, And not a soul survived? Occo. Your pardon, no; Some other trifle's in your thoughts; at Sas There is no fort, and they who perish'd there Were but three hundred peasants who were burn'd By firing of a barn to which they'd fled. Clara. Ah, was it so? At Zeveren then, surely— Occo. What happen'd there, too, was of no account. Clara. Oh, pardon me; the modesty which still Accompanies true valour, casts in shade Your noble actions. I beseech you tell What came to pass at Zeveren? Occo. The town Was taken by surprise. Clara. Ay, true, and then The garrison that made themselves so strong Within the convent's walls— Occo. At Zeveren There was no garrison. Clara. You say not so? How false is fame! I'm certain I was told Of a great onslaught in the convent there. Occo. Well; a proportion of the sisterhood Met with mishap. But, Lady, by your leave We'll treat of other things. Haply not knowing The usages of war, you scarce approve Proceedings which its hard necessities Will oft-times force upon us warriors. A softer theme were meeter, and there's one On which I burn to speak. Clara. Alack, alack! Then I am gone; soft speeches please mine ear, As do soft pillows—when I fain would sleep. But what's the time of day? Come, Henry, come; We walk by high examples in this world; Let's to the poultry-yard and win our spurs. Give you good day, my Lord. [Exeunt Clara and Page. Occo. A merry lady, And swift of speech: but now that she is gone, I must entreat your hearing for a word Of graver import—grave, if aught imports The life or death of this poor heart of mine. A burning fiery furnace is this heart; I waste like wax before a witch's fire Whilst but one word from you would make earth heaven, And I must soon be nothing or a god! There's an unutterable want and void, A gulf, a craving and a sucking in, As when a mighty ship goes down at sea. I roam about with hunger-bitten heart, A famine in my bosom, a dry heat, A desperate thirst, and I must glut it now, Or like a dog by summer solstice parch'd I shall go mad. Adriana. Your pardon, good my Lord, You flatter me or else deceive yourself; But, so far as I may, I yield you thanks, And if no more than thanks, the poorer I, That have not more to give. Occo. Nay, Lady, nay; Deem that I've been tormented long enough And let this coyness have a timely end. Adriana. I am not coy, and plainly now to speak, When aught but plainness should be less than just, I cannot be your wife. Occo. And wherefore so? 'Tis not that love is foreign to your breast; You will not tell me that? Adriana. I've told you all Which it can profit you to know. Occo. Ah! now I see it clearly; there's some smooth-tongued rogue Has been before me,—yea, some wheedling slave, With song and dance and lute and lily hands, Has wriggled into favour, I the while Fighting hard battles to my neck in blood. Tell me in honesty if this be sooth: If it be not, in charity say No. Adriana. In charity I never will speak more With you, Sir Guy of Occo: Nor, till I see a sign of gentle blood Or knightly courtesy in one so bold, Will I again hold converse, or with him Or any that abets him. This to me! [Exit. Occo. Thanks, gentle Lady! Thanks, kind, loving soul! I am instructed; there came out the truth; Much more those eyes flash'd out than tongue could tell. They are as plain to read as are the stars To him who knows their signs. Would that I knew The name of him who blocks the way; his name, And what star rules him in the house of life. Who hither rides and waves that long salute? Philip Van Artevelde! 'Tis he, 'tis he, And no more need I knowledge of the stars. Scene III. —The Stadt-House. Enter Myk Steensel, followed by several Burghers. Myk. And who is Van den Bosch, resolve me that: I say, Sirs, who is he, to lay on taxes? 1st Burgher. Or Ackerman, or Launoy, who are they? Myk. I say, Sirs, if our goods be not our own, Better our natural liege Lord should have them Than thus to render them to John or Peter. 2nd Burgher. Why, look you, Sirs, our case stands simply here: The Earl of Flanders is a valiant Lord, And was a gracious master, till the Devil, Who never sleeps, awaken'd them of Bruges To dig about the Lis to turn the water. But what, Sirs,—we have fought enough for that. Myk. Why still the more we fight the more we lose; For every battle that our White-Hoods win But gives a warrant to this Van den Bosch To spoil us of our substance.—Welcome, Sirs. Enter two Deans of the Crafts. 1st Dean. Friends, have ye heard the news? Myk. I know not, Sir; If the news be, we owe the White-Hoods pay For giving us a hosier for our liege, 'Tis old, Sir, old. 2nd Dean. No, this is what you'll owe them; A ready market for your rats and mice. Corn is already risen cent. per cent., Though many question if the news be true. Our John of Launoy's slain with all his men, The Quatre-Metiers lost and much beside. Myk. No more supplies from Brabant then. But say, How came it all about? 2nd Dean. 'Twas briefly thus: Beside Nivelle the Earl and Launoy met; Six thousand voices volley'd to the skies “Ghent the good Town! Ghent and the White-Hoods! Ghent!” But from that force thrice-told there came the cry Of “Flanders with the Lion of the Bastard!” So then the battle join'd, and they of Ghent Gave back and open'd after three hours' fight, And hardly flying had they gain'd Nivelle When the Earl's vanguard came upon their rear Ere the gate closed, and enter'd with them; then They all were slain save Launoy and his guard, Who, barricaded in the Minster tower, Made desperate resistance, whereupon The Earl wax'd wrothful and bade fire the church. 1st Burgher. Say'st thou? O sacrilege accursed! Was't done? 2nd Dean. 'Twas done,—and presently was heard a yell, And after that the rushing of the flames! Then Launoy from the steeple cried aloud “A ransom!” and held up his coat to sight With florins fill'd; but they without but laugh'd And mock'd him, saying, “Come amongst us, John, And we will give thee welcome; make a leap; Come out at window, John.”—With that the flames Rose up and reach'd him, and he drew his sword, Cast his rich coat behind him in the fire, And shouting “Ghent, ye slaves!” leapt freely forth, When they below received him on their spears. And so died John of Launoy. 1st Burgher. A brave end. 'Tis certain we must now make peace betimes; The city will be starved else—Will be? nay! Starvation is upon us; want and woe Stand round about and stare us in the face. And what will be the end? Myk. Believe me, Sirs, So long as Van den Bosch bears rule in Ghent You'll not have peace; for well wots he no terms That spare his life will pacify the Earl. Sirs, if we make no peace but with the will Of them whose heads must answer it, woe to us! For we must fight for ever; Sirs, I say, We must put down this Van den Bosch, and up The men that with the Earl stand fair and free, Who shall take counsel for the city's weal. Burghers. Truly we must, Myk. Then, friends, stand fast by me, And as we're all agreed to give no doit Of this five hundred marks, a tongue have I Will tell him so in words more just than nice. Enter Van den Bosch, Frans Ackerman, and the Lord of Occo, with a retinue of White-Hoods. Van Den Bosch. Good morrow, worthy friends; good morrow, all! 'Tis a sweet sight to look on, in these times, A score of true and trusty friends to Ghent So fresh and hearty and so well provided. Ah, Sirs, you know not, you, who lies afield When nights are cold, with frogs for bed-fellows; You know not, you, who fights and sheds his blood And fasts and fills his belly with the east wind! Poor souls and virtuous citizens they are! 'Tis they that keep the franchises of Ghent. But, what! they must be fed; they must have meat! Sirs, have ye brought me these five hundred marks That they demanded? Myk. Master Van den Bosch, Look round about; as many as stand here Are of one mind, and this is what they think: The company of White-Hoods, some time past, Were, as thou say'st, brave citizens and true, And they fought stoutly for our franchises; But they were afterward as beasts of prey, That, tasting blood, grow greedy and break loose And turn upon their keepers: so at length The city, like a camp in mutiny, Saw nothing else to walk her streets unharm'd But these your free companions. They at will Enter'd our houses, lived upon our means In riotry, made plunder of our goods, Debauched our wives and daughters; and if once Some hardy fool made bold to lift his hand For safeguard of his own, he met his death. Now this no longer will we suffer; no, Nor will we give our substance so to feed The lewd excesses of your crew. Van den Bosch. How now, Myk Steensel! Truly thou art bold of tongue; I marvel thou shouldst speak so traitor-like In presence of such honest, virtuous men As these thou seest about me. How can I, Think you, give warranty that some good soul, Inflamed with anger at thy foolish speech, May not cut out thy tongue and slit thy nose For uttering of such treasons? Myk. Van den Bosch, Thou thinkst by this to hound thy pack upon me; But dog and huntsman I alike defy. Thy brother Launoy with his men-at-arms Will never answer to thy bidding more: And if thou dare do violence to me Thou shalt be fain to take as long a leap As his was at Nivelle. Van den Bosch. Oh, ho! good Sirs! 'Tis this then that emboldens you, this tale Brought by Van Borselen, who ran away Before the fight began, and calls it lost That so his cowardice should stand excused; For which his foul betrayal and false report I have already had him gibbeted. Bring not yourselves, I pray you, gentle Sirs, With the like nimbleness to a grave i' the air. I say, Sirs, bring me these five hundred marks, And that or e'er to morrow's sun go down— Five hundred marks—I'll bate you not a scute. Ye slothful, hide-blown, gormandizing niggards! What, all must starve but you, that lie a-bed Paunch uppermost, and lack a day of fast To purge your grossness. Know ye who I am? Or are ye sleeping off the last night's wine, And deeming this some tustle with your wives For pulling of a blanket here or there? Five hundred marks—begone and bring it! Myk. So; Begone we will. Let's to our homes, my friends; And what we'll bring thee thou shalt know betimes, Nor wait the setting of to-morrow's sun. Not gold, Sir, no, nor silver, be thou sure, But what shall best befit a brave man's hand. [Exeunt Myk and the Burghers; the retinue of White-Hoods follow. Manent Van den Bosch, Occo, and Frans Ackerman. Van den Bosch. You see, Sirs, how the rogues take heart and rail On this mishap. Occo. I saw both that and more; Our White-Hoods looked like recreants faint with fright, As though they knew not which to fear the most, Thy rod and gallows-tree, or the Earl's block. Peter, we're crumbling. Van den Bosch. You have judged aright. But what can I? Our chiefs drop one by one; Launoy, too truly, perish'd at Nivelle; Le Clerc lies leaning up against a hedge (Till some one dare go bury him) at Chem; Your cousin fell with Launoy. Now, Van Ranst And Lichtenvelde are good for men-at-arms, But want the wit to govern a great town. And I am good at arms, and want not wit; But then I'm sore suspected of the rich, By reason of my rudeness, and the fruit Which that same gallows-tree of mine has borne: And to say truth, although my wit be good, It has a fitter range without the gates, In ordering of an enterprise, than here. The city leans to peace for lack of brains, And on its shoulders we must stick a head. Occo. Hast thou bethought thee of a man that's wise And fit to bear this rule? Van den Bosch. Why such there be; Though one that's wise would scarce be wise to take it. What think'st thou, Frans? Canst pick me out a man That, being wise, were willing? Ackerman. There's no game So desperate that the wisest of the wise Will not take freely up for love of power, Or love of fame, or merely love of play. These men are wise, and then reputed wise, And so their great repute of wisdom grows, Till for great wisdom a great price is bid, And then their wisdom do they part withal: Such men must still be tempted with high stakes. Occo. Tempt them and take them; true, there be such men; Philip Van Artevelde is such a man. Van den Bosch. That is well thought of. Philip is the man. Scene IV. —The House Van Merestyn. Adriana Van Merestyn and Clara Van Artevelde. Clara. So you have dismissed the Lord of Occo? Adriana. Yes. Clara. How many suitors have you discharged this morning? Adriana. How many? Clara. Yes. Was not Philip here? Adriana. He saw me through the lattice and stayed his horse an instant under the window. Clara. Was that all? Adriana. Yes—no—yes—I suppose so. Clara. Oh that maids would learn to speak the truth, or else to lie becomingly! Adriana. Do I not lie becomingly?—Well, 'tis from want of use. What should I say? Clara. What say? Had my sworn friend so questioned me, And I been minded, maugre all our vows, To coil my thoughts up in my secret self, I with a brave and careless hardihood Had graced the disavowal of my love. Adriana. But did I say I loved him not? Oh, God! If I said that, I say since truth was truth There never was a falsehood half so false. I say I love him, and I say beside That but to say I love him is as nought; 'Tis but a tithe and scantling of the truth; And oh! how much I love him what can tell? Not words—not tears—Heaven only knows how much, And every evening when I say my prayers I pray to be forgiven for the sin Of loving aught on earth with such a love. Clara. Well, God forgive you! for you answer now Like a true maid and honest, though a sinning. But tell me, if that's mention'd in your prayers, For how much love has he to be forgiven? Adriana. Alas! I know not. Clara. Nay, but you can guess. Adriana. Oh I have guessed a thousand times too oft; And sometimes I am hopeful as the dawn, And up my fluttering heart is borne aloft As high and gladsome as the lark, and then, As meeting in mid-flight the fowler's shaft, It comes plumb down with such a dead, dead fall. Clara. And all the while is he, I nothing doubt, As wayward and as love-sick as yourself. Adriana. He love-sick! No—it may be that he loves, But if he does, 'tis in no sickly sort. His nerves are made of other cord than ours; He strays as is his wont along the Lis, A careless angler with his rod and line; And when he told me he must come to-night, And that he then would lay a burden down Too long in silence borne, so calm and strong His voice, I doubted if it could be love He harboured in his thoughts. Clara. Oh! much the doubt! But this I knew; I read it written large When answering with your vacant No and Yes You fed upon your thoughts. Adriana. But honestly, What think you? Think you that it must be love He comes to speak of? Clara. Well, 'tis either that Or else to tell you of what fish he caught. Adriana. Oh, do not tease me, Sweet; I am not well; I cannot frisk and gambol. Clara. As you please; But if your love's so lamentable sick, Nurse it yourself: I'll go. Adriana. With all my heart; You're too light-headed for my company. Clara. Is it with all your heart? Then I'll not go, Or else I'll take you with me. Come, I say; Your garden has its troubles like yourself And lacks your tendance; from the soft south-west The winds have broken in, and many a flower Looks ruffled and is hanging down its head Since the bold kissing of those wild intruders. Come then with me; the dew is on the grass, Two snails are running races, and ere night A frog that jumps and stares and stares and jumps, A little frog, light-headed if you will, But having eyes to see, will know which wins. Scene V. —The House Van Artevelde. Philip Van Artevelde and Father John of Heda. Artevelde. I never look'd that he should live so long. He was a man of that unsleeping spirit, He seem'd to live by miracle: his food Was glory, which was poison to his mind And peril to his body. He was one Of many thousand such that die betimes, Whose story is a fragment known to few; Then comes the man who has the luck to live And he's a prodigy. Weigh chance with chance And deem there's ne'er a one in dangerous times Who wins the race of glory, but than him A thousand men more gloriously endowed Have fallen upon the course; a thousand more Have had their fortunes by haphazard wreck'd Whilst lighter barks push'd past them; to whom add A smaller tally, of the singular few Who, gifted with predominating powers, Bear yet a temperate will and keep the peace. The world knows nothing of its greatest men. Father John. Had Launoy lived he might have passed for great, But not by conquests in the Franc of Bruges. The sphere, the scale of circumstance, is all That makes the wonder of the many. Still An ardent soul was Launoy's, and his deeds Were such as dazzled many a Flemish dame. There'll some bright eyes in Ghent be dimm'd for him. Artevelde. They will be dim and then be bright again. All is in busy, stirring, stormy motion, And many a cloud drifts by and none sojourns. Lightly is life laid down amongst us now, And lightly is death mourn'd: a dusk star blinks As fleets the rack, but look again, and lo! In a wide solitude of wintry sky Twinkles the re-illuminated star, And all is out of sight that smirch'd the ray. We have not time to mourn. Father John. The worse for us! He that lacks time to mourn lacks time to mend. Eternity mourns that. 'Tis an ill cure For life's worst ills to have no time to feel them. Where sorrow's held intrusive and turn'd out There wisdom will not enter, nor true power, Nor aught that dignifies humanity. Yet such the barrenness of busy life! From shelf to shelf Ambition clambers up To reach the naked'st pinnacle of all, Whilst Magnanimity, absolved from toil, Reposes self-included at the base. But this you know. Artevelde. Else had I little learn'd From my much learn'd preceptor. Enter the Page. Artevelde. Whence art thou? Hast thou been idling in the market-place? Canst tell whose chattels have been sold to-day For payment of the White-Hoods? Page. Sir, I cannot; 'Tis at the house Van Merestyn I've been To see the Lady Adriana. Artevelde. Her! Well, and what said the damsel? Page. Sir, not much; For Mistress Clara was her visitor, And she said everything; she said it all. Artevelde. What was it that they spake of? Page. When I came The talk was all of chivalry and love; And presently arrived the Lord of Occo. Artevelde. And what was talk'd of then? Page. Oh! still the same. The ladies praised him mightily for deeds The fame whereof, far-spreading, should eclipse Sir Rowland's and Sir Oliver's. Artevelde. Mark you that, Good Father, mark you that! Hearts soft as wax These damsels would be thought to bear about, Yet ever is the bloodiest Knight the best. Father John. Oh, it is true. Full many a dame I've known Who'd faint and sicken at the sight of blood, And shriek and wring her hands and rend her hair To see her Lord brought wounded to the door— Many to weep by day, at night lie down The nightmare sole sad partner of their bed, Rise up in horror to recount bad dreams And seek to witches to interpret them,— This oft I've known, but never knew I one Who'd be content her Lord should live at home In love and Christian charity and peace. Artevelde. And wherefore so? Because the women's heaven Is vanity, and that is over all. What's firiest still finds favour in their eyes; What's noisiest keeps the entrance of their ears. The noise and blaze of arms enchants them most: Wit, too, and wisdom, that's admired of all, They can admire—the glory, not the thing. An unreflected light did never yet Dazzle the vision feminine. For me, Nor noise nor blaze attend my peaceful path; Nor, were it otherwise, should I desire That noise and blaze of mine won any heart. Wherefore it is that I would fain possess, If any, that which David wept,—a love Passing the love of women. Father John. Deem you not There may be one who so transcends her sex In loving as to match the son of Saul? Artevelde. It may be I have deem'd or dream'd of such; But what know I? We figure to ourselves The thing we like, and then we build it up As chance will have it, on the rock or sand: For thought is tired of wandering o'er the world And home-bound fancy runs her bark ashore. Enter an Attendant. Attendant. Sir, here is Master Van den Bosch below Desires to speak with you. Artevelde. To speak with me! I marvel on what errand Van den Bosch Can seek Van Artevelde. I come. So say. Will you not stay? Father John. No, no, my son; farewell! The very name of men like Van den Bosch Sends me to prayers. Scene VI. —The Market-place, at the entrance of the Clothiers' Hall. The Provost of the Clothiers, with several Burghers and the Chaplain of that craft. Provost. Him! did ye say? choose him for Captain? So! Then look about you in the morning, friends, For ye shall find him stirring before noon; The latest time o' the day is twelve o' the clock; Then comes he forth his study with his book, And looking off and on like parson preaching, Delivers me his orders. 1st Burgher. Nay, Provost, nay; He is a worthy and a mild good man, And we have need of such. Chaplain. He's what you say; But 'tis not mildness of the man that rules Makes the mild regimen. Provost. Who's to rule the fierce? “I prithee, Van den Bosch, cut not that throat; Roast not this man alive, or, for my sake, If roast he must, not at so slow a fire; Nor yet so hastily impale this other, But give him time to ruminate and foretaste So terrible an end.” Mild Philip thus Shall read his lecture of humanity. Chaplain. Truly the tender mercies of the weak, As of the wicked, are but cruel. Well; Pass we within; the most of us are here, And Heaven direct us to a just resolve! [Exeunt all but two Burghers. 1st Burgher. The scaffold, as I see, is newly wet. Who was the last that suffer'd? 2nd Burgher. What, to-day? I know not; but the brave Van Borselen's blood (God rest his soul!) can scarcely yet be dry That suffer'd yesterday. 1st Burgher. For treason was't? 2nd Burgher. The treason of the times; the being rich; His wealth was wanted. 1st Burgher. Hath he not an heir? 2nd Burgher. A bold one if he claim the inheritance. Come, pass we in. Scene VII. —The House Van Artevelde. Artevelde and Van den Bosch. Artevelde. This is a mighty matter, Van den Bosch, And much to be revolved ere it be answered. Van den Bosch. The people shall elect you with one voice. I will ensure the White-Hoods, and the rest Will eagerly accept your nomination, So to be rid of some that they like less. Your name is honour'd both of rich and poor; For all are mindful of the glorious rule Your father bore, when Flanders, prosperous then, From end to end obey'd him as one town. Artevelde. They may remember it—and, Van den Bosch, May I not too bethink me of the end To which this people brought my father? Yes, Of his good husbandry they gorged the fruits, Till, drunk with long prosperity, and blind With too much fatness, they tore up the root From which their common weal had sprung and grown. Van den Bosch. Nay, Master Philip, let the past be past. Artevelde. Here on the doorstep of my father's house The blood of his they spilt is seen no more; But when I was a child I saw it there; For so long as my widow-mother lived Water might touch not that memorial stain. She loved to show it me, and then with awe, But hoarding still the purpose of revenge, I heard the tale—which like a daily prayer Repeated, to a rooted feeling grew— How long he fought, how falsely came like friends The villains Guisebert Grutt and Simon Bette,— All the base murder of the one by many. Even such a brutal multitude as they Who slew my father, yea, who slew their own, (For like one had he ruled them first and last) Even such a multitude you'd have me sway. Van den Bosch. Why, what if Jacques Artevelde was killed? He had his reign, and that for many a year, And a great glory did he gain thereby. And as for Guisebert Grutt and Simon Bette, Their breath is in their nostrils as was his; If you be as stout-hearted as your sire And mindful of the villainous part they play'd, Their hour of reckoning is well-nigh come. Of that, and of this base false-hearted league They're making with the Earl, these two to us Shall give account. Artevelde. They cannot render back The golden bowl that's broken at the fountain, Or mend the wheel that's broken at the cistern, Or twist again the silver cord that's loosed. Yea, life for life, vile bankrupts as they are, Their worthless lives for his of countless price, Is their whole wherewithal to pay their debt. Yet retribution is a child of grace, And I could well baptize it in their blood. Van den Bosch. Then will I call the people to the Square And speak for your election. Artevelde. Not so fast. Your vessel, Van den Bosch, has felt the storm: She rolls dismasted in an ugly swell, And you would make a jury-mast of me Whereon to spread the tatters of your sails. And what am I?—I fain would be the oak That, rooted in the vale of life apart, Welcomes with equal breast each wind that blows, Nor knows of fair and foul. Van den Bosch. Ho! what is this? I pray you, speak it in the Burghers' tongue; I lack the scholarship to talk in tropes. Artevelde. Then view the matter naked as it stands: Shall I, who, chary of tranquillity, Not busy in this factious city's broils, Nor frequent in the market-place, eschew'd The even battle,—shall I join the rout? Van den Bosch. Times are sore changed, I see; there's none in Ghent That answers to the name of Artevelde. Your father did not carp nor question thus When Ghent besought his aid. The days have been When not a citizen drew breath in Ghent But freely would have died in freedom's cause. Artevelde. With a good name the cause you christen. True; In choice of despots is some freedom found, The only freedom for this turbulent town, Rule her who may. And in my father's time We still were independent, if not free; And wealth from independence, and from wealth Enfranchisement, will partially proceed. The cause, I grant you, Van den Bosch, is good; And were I link'd to earth no otherwise But that my whole heart centred in myself, I could have toss'd you this poor life to play with, Taking no second thought. But as things are, I will review the matter warily, And send you word betimes of my resolve. Van den Bosch. Betimes it must be; for some two hours hence I meet the Deans of crafts, and ere we part Our course must be determined. Artevelde. In two hours, If I be for you, I will send this ring In token I'm so minded. Fare you well. Van den Bosch. Philip Van Artevelde, a greater man Than ever Ghent beheld we'll make of you, If you be bold enough to try this venture. God give you heart to do so, and farewell. [Exit Van den Bosch. Artevelde. Is it vain-glory which thus whispers me That 'tis ignoble to have led my life In idle meditations—that the times Demand me, echoing my father's name? Oh! what a fiery heart was his! such souls Whose sudden visitations daze the world, Vanish like lightning, but they leave behind A voice that in the distance far away Wakens the slumbering ages. Father! Yes, Thy life is eloquent, and more persuades Unto dominion than thy death deters; For that reminds me of a debt of blood Descended with my patrimony to me, Whose paying off would clear my soul's estate. Enter Clara. Clara. Was some one here? I thought I heard you speak. Artevelde. You heard me speak? Clara. I surely thought I heard you, Just now, as I came in. Artevelde. It may be so. Clara. Was no one here then? Artevelde. No one, as you see. Clara. Why then I trust the orator your tongue Found favour with the audience your ears; But this poor orator of mine finds none, For all at once I see they droop and flag. Will you not listen? I've a tale to tell. Artevelde. My fairest, sweetest, best beloved girl! Who in the whole world would protect thy youth If I were gone? Clara. Gone! where? what ails you, Philip? Artevelde. Nowhere, my love. Well, what have you to tell? Clara. When I came home, on entering the hall I stared to see the household all before me. There was the steward sitting on the bench, His head upon his hands between his knees; In the oak chair old Ursel sate upright Swaying her body—so—from side to side, Whilst maids and varlets stood disconsolate round. What cheer? quoth I. But not a soul replied. Is Philip well? Yea, Madam, God be praised. Then what dost look so gloomy for, my friend? Alack a-day, the stork! then all chimed in, The stork, the stork, the stork! What, he is sick? No, Madam; sick!—he's gone—he's flown away! Why then, quoth I, God speed him! speaking so To raise their hearts, but they were all-too-heavy. And, Philip, to say truth, I could have wish'd This had not happen'd. Artevelde. I remember now, I thought I miss'd his clatter all night long. Clara. Old Ursel says the sign proved never false In all her time,—and she's so very old! And then she says that Roger was esteem'd The wisest stork in Ghent, and flew away But twice before—the first time in the night Before my father took that office up Which proved so fatal in the end; and then The second time, the night before he died. Artevelde. Sooner or later, something, it is certain, Must bring men to their graves. Our every act Is death's forerunner. It is but the date That puzzles us to fix. My father lived In that ill-omen'd office many a year, And men had augur'd he must die at last Without the stork to aid. If this be all The wisest of his tribe can prophesy, I am as wise as he. Enough of this. You have been visiting your friend to-day,— The Lady Adriana. Clara. I come thence: She is impatiently expecting you. Artevelde. Can she with such impatience flatter one So slothful and obscure as Artevelde? Clara. How mean you? Artevelde. Clara, know I not your sex? Is she not one of you? Are you not all, All from the shade averse? All prompt and prone To make your idol of the million's idol? Had I been one of these rash White-Hood chiefs Who live by military larceny, Then might I well believe that she would wait Impatiently my coming. Clara. There you're wrong; She never loved the White-Hoods. Artevelde. She were wise In that unloving humour to abide; To wed a White-Hood, other ills apart, Would put in jeopardy her fair possessions. Fatal perchance it might be to her wealth; Fatal it surely would be to her weal. Farewell her peace, if such a one she loved. Clara. Go ask her, Philip,—ask her whom she loves, And she will tell you it is no such man. Why go you not? Artevelde. My mind is not at ease. Yet I am going—to my chamber now, Where let me own an undisturb'd half hour Of rumination;—afterward to her. Scene VIII. —The Market-place in front of the Stadt-House. Enter two of Van den Bosch's Officers, dragging a Burgher between them, and followed by an Executioner with an axe and a crowd of Citizens. A scaffold is seen at a distance. 1st Officer. Where hast thou put it? Burgher. What? Put what—put what? 2nd Officer. A few last words—where is it? Burgher. Mercy! what? 1st Officer. Oh, very well! Come, clap his thumb in a winch. Burgher. No need of that—what is it that ye seek? 1st Officer. Van Borselen's head. 'Twas sticking on that spike At nine last night. Who took it thence but thou? Burgher. I never touch'd it. 2nd Officer. Thou art next of kin, And rightfully shouldst fill his vacancy. 1st Officer. Thy head to his stands in a just succession. Besides, they are as like as are two cherries. Bring him away! 2nd Officer. Friend with the axe, come on! [Exeunt all but two Citizens. 1st Citizen. When will this end? 2nd Citizen. When Van den Bosch . . . 1st Citizen. Hush! Hush! Scene IX. —The Entrance-Hall of the House Van Merestyn. Enter Artevelde with Attendants. Artevelde. Bear thou these letters to my steward; say That messengers must straight proceed with them To Grammont and elsewhere, as superscribed; And should mishap occur to any one Upon the road, which is not over free, I charge me with ten masses for his soul. (To another) The Lord of Occo's counsel I will weigh; So tell him, with my service and my thanks. (To the rest) I will return alone. If any come To seek me at my house, entreat their stay. They withdraw, and a Waiting-Woman enters. This, if I err not, is the pretty wench That waits upon my Lady. What, fair maid! Thy mistress, having comeliness to spare, Hath given thee of it. She's within, I think, Or else wert thou a truant. Waiting-Woman. Sir, she is. Artevelde. Acquaint her then that I attend her here. [Exit Waiting-Woman. There is but one thing that still harks me back. To bring a cloud upon the summer's day Of one so made for happiness and peace,— It is a hard condition. For myself, I know not that the circumstance of life, Change how it may, can so far work within As makes it much worth while to look before. But she is younger,—of a sex beside Whose spirits are to ours as flame to fire, More sudden and more perishable too; So that the gust which vivifies the one Extinguishes the other. Oh, she is fair! As fair as Heaven to look upon! as fair As ever vision of the Virgin blest That weary pilgrim, resting by the fount Beneath the palm and dreaming to the tune Of flowing waters, duped his soul withal. It was permitted in my pilgrimage To rest beside the fount beneath the tree, Beholding there no vision, but a maid Whose form was light and graceful as the palm, Whose heart was pure and springing as the fount, And spread a freshness and a verdure round. This was permitted in my pilgrimage, And loth am I to take my staff again. Say that I fall not in this enterprise, Yet must my road be full of hazardous turns, And they that walk with me must look to meet, Not lions only in the path, but snakes.— Danger from foes—a daylight danger that; Danger from tyrants—that too is seen and known; But jealous multitudes and envious friends— In dusk to walk through endless ambuscades— [A pause. Still for myself, I fear not but that I, Taking what comes, leaving what leave I must, Could make a sturdy struggle through the world. But for the maid, the choice were better far To win her dear heart back again if lost, And stake it upon some less dangerous throw. Re-enter Waiting-Woman. Waiting-Woman. My Mistress, Sir, so please you, takes her walk Along the garden terrace, and desires That you'll go forth to meet her. Artevelde. For if Fate Had done its best to single out a soul Whose very birthright should ensure her—Ah! The garden say you, and the terrace? So. [Exit. Waiting-Woman. Now there's a man might make my Lady happy if he would but waken up. That's the point. Comely we may grant him and gracious; but though a lover were never so goodly to behold, what is the use of him walking in his sleep like a bat or a dormouse?—Coming, coming, Steward, I hear you. Always shouting after me. Truly there is a whisper abroad that he cannot live without me. Scene X. —A Garden. Artevelde and Adriana. Artevelde. I have some little overstayed my time. First pardon me that trespass. Adriana. Yes, indeed; I said to Clara when the sun went down, Now if,—though truly 'tis impossible— He come not ere yon blushing cloud grows gray, His word itself is but a tinted cloud; And look how gray it is! Artevelde. A hectic change. The smiling dawn, the laughing blue-eyed day, The graybeard eve incessantly pass on, Fast fleeting generations, born of time And buried in eternity—they pass, And not a day resigns its little life And enters into darkness, that can say, “Lo! I was fair, and such as I have been My issue shall be; Lo! I cast abroad Such affluence of glory over earth, That what had been but goodly to the sight Was made magnificent, what had been bare Show'd forth a naked beauty—in all this Was I thus rich, and that which I possess'd To-morrow shall inherit.” False as hope! To-morrow's heritage is cloud and storm. Adriana. Oh! what a moody moralist you grow! Yet in the even-down letter you are right; For Gerard, who is weather-wise, says true, That when the sun sets red with the wind south The morrow shall be stormy. What of that? Oh! now I know; the fish won't take the bait. 'Tis marvellous the delight you take in fishing! Were I to hang upon a river's edge So tediously, angling, angling still, The fiend that watches our impatient fits Would sometime tempt me to jump headlong in. And you—you cannot quit it for a day! Have I not read your sadness? Artevelde. Have you so? Oh! you are cunning to divine men's thoughts. But come what may to-morrow, we have now A tranquil hour, which let us entertain As though it were the latest of its kind. Adriana. Why should we think it so? Artevelde. My gentle friend, I trust that many such may come to you; But for myself, I feel as if life's stream Were shooting o'er some verge, to make a short, An angry and precipitate descent, Thenceforward much tormented. Adriana. Why is this? What can have fill'd you with such sad surmise? You were not wont to speak despondently. Artevelde. Nor do I now despond. All my life long I most have prized the man who knew himself, And knew the ways before him, rough or smooth, And from amongst them chose, not blindly brave, But with considerate courage and calm will; And, having chosen, with a steadfast mind Pursued his purposes. I train'd myself To take my place in high or low estate As one of that scant order of mankind. Wherefore, though I indulge no more the dream Of living as I hoped I might have lived, An inward life of temperate content, Yet I repine not, and from this time forth Will cast no look behind. Adriana. Oh, Artevelde! What change has come since morning! Oh! how soon The words and looks which spoke of joy and peace, To me at least—how soon are they revoked! But let them be—it matters not: I, too, Will cast no look behind—Oh, if I should . . . Artevelde. Now see! ere aught is utter'd you run wild In false conjecture; hear what I would say. If hitherto we have not said we loved, Yet hath the heart of each declared its love By all the tokens wherein love delights. We heretofore have trusted in each other, Too wholly have we trusted to have need Of word or vow or pledge or plighted faith. Where is it gone, that trust? Adriana. I trusted not; I hoped and feared, doubted and hoped again, Till this day, when I first breathed freelier, Daring to trust—and now—O God, my heart! It was not made to bear this agony— Tell me you love me or you love me not! Artevelde. I love thee, dearest, with as large a love As e'er was compass'd in the breast of man. Hide then those tears, beloved, where thou wilt, And find a resting-place for that so tost And troubled heart of thine; sustain it here, And be its flood of passion wept away. Adriana. What was it that you said then? If you love, Why do you terrify me thus? Artevelde. Be calm; And let me warn thee, ere thy choice be fix'd, What fate thou mayst be wedded to with me. Thou hast beheld me living heretofore In staid tranquillity as one retired: The dweller in the mountains, on whose ear The accustom'd cataract thunders unobserved, The seaman who sleeps sound upon the deck Nor hears the loud lamenting of the blast Nor heeds the weltering of the restless wave,— These have not lived more undisturb'd than I: But build not upon this; the swollen stream May shake the cottage of the mountaineer And drive him forth; the seaman roused at length Leaps from his slumber on the wave-wash'd deck; And now the time comes fast when here in Ghent He who would live exempt from injuries Of armed men, must be himself in arms. This time is near for all,—nearer for me: I will not wait upon necessity And leave myself no choice of vantage ground, But rather meet the times where best I may And mould and fashion them as best I can. Be warned then of the hazard and the cost, The threatenings of the hour, the frowns of Fate,— Yes, weigh them well, and in your own free choice Take or reject me. Adriana. Say you my free choice? Oh, Artevelde! my choice is free no more. Be mine, all mine, let good or ill betide; In war or peace, in sickness or in health, In trouble and in danger and in distress, Through time and through eternity, I'll love thee: In youth and age, in life and death, I'll love thee, Here and hereafter, with all my soul and strength; So God accept me, as I never cease From loving and adoring thee next Him; And oh, may He pardon me if so betray'd By mortal frailty as to love thee more. Artevelde. I fear, my Adriana, 'tis a rash And passionate resolve that thou hast made: But how should I admonish thee, myself So great a winner by thy desperate play. Heaven is o'er all, and unto Heaven I leave it; That which has made me weak shall make me strong, Weak to resist, strong to requite thy love; And if some tax thou payest for that love, Thou shalt receive it from Love's exchequer. Farewell; I'm waited for ere this. Adriana. Farewell. But take my signet-ring and give me thine, That I may know when I have slept and waked This was no false enchantment of a dream. Artevelde. My signet-ring? I have it not to-day: But in its stead wear this around thy neck. And now, my Adriana, my betroth'd, Give Love a good night's rest within thy heart, And bid him wake to-morrow calm and strong. Scene XI. —Bruges.—An Apartment in the Palace of the Earl of Flanders. The Earl and Sir Walter D'Arlon. D'Arlon. I marvel, my good Lord, you take that knave So freely to your counsels. Earl. Treason done Against my enemies secures him mine. Ghent never can forgive him what is past, Which knowing, he will therefore cleave to me. Besides, he learns the minds of men; how each, Here and in Ghent, is leaning, off or on. For this and other serviceable arts I show him favour, not for better gifts. Have you not seen a jackdaw take his stand On a sheep's back, permitted there to perch Less out of kindness to so foul a bird Than for commodious uses of his beak? As to the sheep the jackdaw, so to me Is Gilbert Matthew; from my fleece he picks The vermin that molest me.—Here he comes! Enter Gilbert Matthew. Well, honest Gilbert, are the Knights not gone? Gilbert. Not yet, my Lord: they urge in lieu of lives The forfeiture of sundry burgages To fill your coffers. I denied them. Earl. Why? I bade thee not! Gilbert. Lives, lives, my Lord, take freely, But spare the lands and burgages and moneys. The father dead, shall sleep and be forgotten; The patrimony gone,—that makes a wound That's slow to heal; heirs are above-ground ever. Earl. Well, be it so. Gilbert. The Knights wait here without. They ask an audience of leave, and more, They bring a new adherent. Earl. Bid them come. Gilbert Matthew goes out, and returns with Sir Simon Bette and Sir Guisebert Grutt. Sir Simon. This audience we made bold to crave, my Lord, To notify your Highness that our friend The Lord of Occo, hazarding his life, Hath ventured hither in disguise, to tell How matters stand in Ghent. Earl. And does he wait? Sir Simon. He does; and with your leave I'll call him in [Exit. Earl. But is he worth his pardon? Gilbert. Past a doubt He has his hand upon the balance now; And free forgiveness for all past misdeeds Will make him wholly yours. Earl. Well, we shall see. 'Tis no such urgent need we have of him; But if he be so contrite, it is well. Re-enter Sir Simon Bette with Occo. You're a bold man, my Lord of Occo, you That have so long borne arms against your Liege, Without safe-conduct to come hither. Occo. Sir, My sole safe-conduct is the good intent I bear to your affairs; nought else prevailed To start me hither, and nought else, I trust, Is needed for my safe return. Earl. Enough; Thou shalt return in safety. Say, what news Bring'st thou from Ghent? Occo. My Lord, peace, peace! is there The only cry, except with desperate chiefs, Who are so weak, that fair conditions now Would draw their followers from them to a man. Earl. Our proffer of conditions is made known Already to our good Sir Simon Bette And Guisebert Grutt. Sir Guisebert. Indemnity to all Save some three hundred souls; and who be these He names not now, but will hereafter. Occo. Well! These terms are just and merciful indeed! But then they must be promptly proffer'd; yes, You know, my Lord, the humour we of Ghent Have still indulged—we never cry for peace But when we're out of breath; give breathing-time, And ere the echo of our cry for peace Have died away, we drown it with War! War! Ev'n now the faction hopes to be redeem'd By a new leader. Earl. What may be his name? Occo. Philip Van Artevelde. Earl. Thou say'st not so! That is a name I like not; it means much. Whenever sunshine has come near my house An Artevelde has cast his shadow there. I have not heard the name of Artevelde Since that usurper Jacques died the death. This Philip then, I think, was but a child. What is he made of? Of his father's metal? A dangerous man, in truth, Sirs, if he be. Gilbert. Oh, fear him not, my Lord; his father's name Is all that from his father he derives. He is a man of singular address In catching river-fish. His life has been, Till now, more like a peasant's or a monk's Than like the issue of his father. Occo. True; Yet is his name so worshipp'd of the crafts, That were the time permitted and the scope To grow expert, some danger might ensue. Wherefore 'twere well to note him on the list Of those three hundred doomed. Earl. No doubt, no doubt. Let him be noted. Think you, then, Sir Guy, That they'll accept our terms, or still hold out? Occo. Let these good Knights make instant speed to Ghent And call the burghers to the market-place; Then let to-morrow at their bidding wear The aspect of to-day, and all will thrive. Take them whilst yet Nivelle is in their thoughts. Earl. You counsel well. Prepare, Sirs, to depart; We'll have the terms engross'd and send them you. Farewell, my Lord; farewell, Sir Simon Bette! Sir Guisebert Grutt, farewell! [Exeunt the Earl, Gilbert Matthew, Occo, and Sir Simon Bette. As Sir Guisebert Grutt is following he is detained by D'Arlon. D'Arlon. One word, fair Sir. Sir Guisebert. My good Lord, at your pleasure. D'Arlon. Only this: I have a foolish errand in your town; There is a damsel . . . . . . but your head is white; You will not heed me. Sir Guisebert. Pray proceed, my Lord; I have not yet forgotten how in youth A damsel's love, amongst the amorous, Was more than bed of down or morning posset. D'Arlon. In brief, kind Sir, conveyance hence to Ghent Is what I crave. Methinks amongst your train, And habited like them, I well could pass And no one mark me. Sir Guisebert. Sir, you're free to try; And if our friends should still be uppermost You will risk nothing. Should the faction reign, You shall do well to keep your secret close And make your best speed back. D'Arlon. Leave that to me. ACT II. Scene I. —Ghent.—The House Van Artevelde. Artevelde and Van den Bosch. Van den Bosch. When they were brought together in the square, I spake. I told them that they lack'd a chief; For though they saw that dangers clipped them round, Amongst their captains there was none could win The love of all, but still some guild or craft Would stone him if they might. I bade them think How Jacques Artevelde from humblest state Had borne this city up to sovereign sway, And how his son had lived aloof from strife, To none bore malice, and wish'd well to all. With that they caught thy name and shouted much; And some old men swore they remember'd well In the good times of Jacques Artevelde, When they were young, that all the world went right, And after he was dead that they grew old; And wenches who were there, said Artevelde Was a sweet name and musical to hear. In brief, for these and other grave regards They were resolved to choose thee for their chief. But “Soft! my friends,” quoth I; “ye know not yet How he inclines to that you'd put upon him; He hath no friends and favourites to reward; He hath no adverse faction to repress; Of what avail to him were power and place? But nathless we'll entreat him.” “Bring him here!” Was then the cry. “More meet it were, my friends,” Quoth I, “that we go seek this noble youth; On such high worth we humbly should attend, And not expect such worth should wait on us.” To this they gave assent, and they'll be here So soon as all are muster'd. Artevelde. When they come I'll tell them something of my mind. Van den Bosch. 'Twere well. Thou canst not miss to please them in this mood. The trial will be after, when they flag And want a long spur-rowel in their bellies. Thou lack'st experience to deal with men; Thou must take counsel. Artevelde. I will hear it. True; It may be I have much to learn. Van den Bosch. Canst learn To bear thee high amongst the Commons? Yea, Canst thou be cruel? To be esteem'd of them, Thou must not set more store by lives of men Than lives of larks in season. Artevelde. Be it so. What's needful I can do. I pray you, where Abide the messengers from Bruges? Van den Bosch. Last night 'Twas in the Clothiers' Square they lodged. Belike They thought their houses not so safe. Artevelde. Why so? Van den Bosch. They enter'd by that side, and as they reach'd Sir Simon's, a few sturdy knaves with pikes, Whom I had planted there, with hasty zeal Brake out before their time, and that with howls That Bruges itself might hear. Artevelde. So they were warned. Van den Bosch. They gallop'd to the Square, the while their train Stood fast and fought it out; and mark you this,— One that was of them shouted in the fray The D'Arlon's war-cry, whence he may be known Of that Lord's following, and wherefore here We well may guess. Artevelde. Had he been slain 'twere well; Had others been 'twere not. If I rule Ghent, No man shall charge me that his life or goods Are less secure than mine, so he but keep The laws that I have made. Believe me, friend, Thy scheme of rule works wastefully, self-sapped. To make the needy and the desperate thine Thou gav'st them up the plunder of the rich; Now these, grown desperate and needy too, Raise up a host against thee, whereupon, No spoil remaining, thy good friends depart. Van den Bosch. God's curse go with them! Artevelde. Like enough it may; They've carried it about these five long years; They took it with them to the peasant's hut, They took it with them to the burgher's stall; A roving curse, it followed at their heels, And with them it will like enough abide. Van den Bosch. Hark! here they come. [Shouts of “Artevelde!” are heard from without. Out, show thyself! Out, out! Scene II. —The Street in front of Artevelde's House. Enter a multitude, led by Frans Ackerman, and the Deans of sundry Crafts. 1st Dean. Well said, Sirs! Shout again. Frans Ackerman. Silence! Enough. There is a time for shouting and bellowing, and there is a time for speaking with our tongues like men and Christians. He will be here anon; and know ye what ye shall say to him? Know ye what ye would have? Know ye your own minds? A Burgher. We know our own minds, Sir, indifferently; but you know them better. 2nd Burgher. We would have a man to rule us, and not to rob us. 3rd Burgher. Right, right! 4th Burgher. Rob thee, truly! Rob a scarecrow! What should he get by robbing thee? 2nd Burgher. What thou shalt get in a minute, this dirk betwixt his ribs. Frans Ackerman. Silence! He's here. Enter Van Artevelde and Van den Bosch. Artevelde. Well met, good Sirs: what brings you here? If aught Wherein I can befriend you, speak your minds, Or let one speak, and should he speak aright Hold up your hands, that so I may receive His words as yours. Several Voices. Frans Ackerman shall speak. Frans Ackerman. Sir, they are pleased to make a mouth of me; And it behoves me first to bid you know What manner of men they are. Sir, to say truth, These men are honest; yea, and wise as honest; And more, they're men of substance, pay their debts, Live peaceably with all men, in good will Like brothers. But this town is full of strife; All men are not like these, who find it hard, Though turning t'other cheek as is their wont, To walk as they would wish. Now they are told, And some of them remember, in time past, When that your glorious father ruled the town, The streets were like a church: no quarrels, brawls, Nor no man dared so much as lay his hand Upon his weapon. As the father is, So is the son. They say that would you deign To rule supreme in Ghent, the strife within Would cease, and all our roisterers be thrown Upon the foe without. If this their suit You should be pleased to grant, most proud were they To serve a chief so gracious and so good. Artevelde. If this be your desire, hold up your hands. [They hold up their hands. So—if my sight deceive me not, all hands Are held aloft. To all, then, this reply: I thank you for the trust and good respect In which you hold me; Sirs, I thank you all. You say that for the love my father bore To you, and you to him, you'd fain have me What he was once—your Captain. Verily, I think ye do not well remember, Sirs, The end of all the love 'twixt you and him. He was the noblest and the wisest man That ever ruled in Ghent; yet, Sirs, ye slew him; By his own door, here where I stand, ye slew him. What then am I to look for from your loves? If the like trust ye should repose in me, And then in like wise cancel it,—my friends, That were an ill reward. Several Burgesses. Nay, Master Philip! Artevelde. Oh, Sirs, ye look not to such end, I know; Nor may it be yourselves that bring it round: But he who rules must needs be grudged of some, And safeguard from the many should he find So long as he shall serve the many well. Sirs, to that end his power must be maintain'd; The power of peace and war, of life and death, He must have absolute. How say ye, Sirs? Will ye bestow this power on me? if so, Shout “Artevelde!” and ye may add to that, “Captain of Ghent!”—if not, go straightway home. [All shout “Artevelde, Captain of Ghent!” Artevelde. So be it. Now listen to your Captain's first command. It has been heretofore the use of some On each cross accident, within, without, To cry aloud for peace. This may not be; It much unsettles brave men's minds, disturbs The counsels of the wise, and daunts the weak. Wherefore my pleasure is, and I decree, That whoso shall but talk of terms of peace From this time forth, save in my private ear, Be deem'd a traitor to the town of Ghent And me its Captain; and a traitor's death Shall that man die. Burgesses. He shall, he shall, he shall! We'll kill the slave outright. Artevelde. At my command, Not otherwise; for mark me further thus: If any citizen shall slay another Without my warranty by word or sign, Although that slayer be as true as steel, This other treacherous as Iscariot's self, The punishment is death. [A pause. Ye speak no word. What do we fight for, friends? for liberty? What is that liberty for which we fight? Is it the liberty to slay each other? Then better were it we had back again Roger d'Auterne, the bailiff. No, my friends, It is the liberty to choose our chief And bow to none beside. Now ye choose me, And in that choice let each man rest assured That none but I shall dare to judge him: yes, Whoso spills blood without my warranty, High man or low, rich man or poor, shall die. Burgesses. The man shall die; he shall deserve to die! We'll kill him on the spot, and that is law. Artevelde. Hold, hold, my friends! ye are too hasty here, You shall not kill him; 'tis the headsman's part, Who first must have my warrant for his death. Burgesses. Kill him who likes, the man shall die; that's law. Artevelde. What further knowledge of my rules ye need Ye peradventure may obtain, my friends, More aptly from my practice than my speech. Now to the Stadt-house—bring the litter—There The deans of crafts shall do me homage. Van den Bosch. Ho! Bring ye the litter. Stand apart, good Sirs! And now, let's hear your voices as ye go. Scene III. The House Van Merestyn. Sir Walter D'Arlon and Clara Van Artevelde, she binding up his arm, which is wounded. Clara. Rude Knight, you come to see your ladye love, And cannot stay your stomach for an hour But you must fight i' the street. Your hungry sword— Could it keep Lent no longer? By my faith, You shall do penance at your lady's feet The live-long night for this. D'Arlon. Nay, cry you mercy! 'Twere a sharp trial, one man to keep Lent Whilst all around kept carnival; the sin Was in the stomachs of your citizens: But I will do the penance not the less. Clara. Come, come! confess yourself; make a clean breast; You'd vow'd a vow to some fair dame at Bruges To kill for her dear love a score of burghers. Nay,—never cross yourself—'tis Gospel truth. Hold up this arm—alas! there was a time When Knights were true and constant to their loves And had but one a-piece—an honest time; Knights were Knights then: God mend the age, say I! True as the steel upon their backs were they, And their one lady's word was law. Ah, well! Would I had lived a hundred years ago! D'Arlon. Could you live backward for a hundred years, And then live on a hundred years to come, You'd not find one to love you in more truth Than I have loved. Clara. What, what! no truer Knight? A seemly word, forsooth! Hast many more? No truer knight!—'Tis thus you great Lords live With flatterers round you all your golden youth, And know yourselves as much as I know Puck— Your heads so many bee-hives; honey'd words Swarm in your ears, and others from your mouth Go buzzing out to ply for sweets abroad; And so your summer wastes, till some cold night The cunning husbandman comes stealthily And there is fire and brimstone for my Lords! Hold up this arm—let go my hand, I say! Am I to tie your bandage with my teeth? Enter Adriana. Adriana. My Lord—good heaven! Your arm—I fear you're hurt. Clara. Hold, hush! I'll answer for you. Just a scratch; A scratch, fair lady,—that and nothing more. It gives us no concern; we got it thus: Riding along the streets of this good town, A score of burghers met us, peaceful drones— Saying their prayers, belike; howe'er that be, The senseless sinners were so rapt and lost, They heeded not our Lordship: whereat we, Unused to such demeanour, shook ourselves, And prick'd them with our lance; a fray ensued, And lo! as we were slaying some fourteen That stayed our passage, it pleased Providence, Of whom the meanest may be instruments, Thus gently to chastise us on the arm, Doubtless for some good cause, tho' Heaven knows what. Adriana. My Lord, you know her; she is ever thus,— Still driving things against you to your face, And when you're gone, if I should chance let fall A word, or but a hint of censure, as— My Lord of Arlon is too rash, too hot, Too anything— Clara. She sighs and says, too true. Adriana. No, verily. But why, my Lord, come here At nothing less than peril of your life, Only to hear her rail? Clara. Yes, tell us why. D'Arlon. Not only that to-day, though till to-day That was enough. But here is one whose weal Has charged me with an errand of less love But graver import. Is't not? Yes, 'tis he! Enter Artevelde. Artevelde (as he enters). Let my guard wait without. Clara. His guard! What's this? Artevelde. My Lord of Arlon, God be with you ever, And guide you upon less adventurous tracks Than this you tread. I'll speak with you anon. My Adriana! victim that thou art! Thy lover should have been some gentle youth In gay attire, with laughter on his lips, Who'd nestle in thy bosom all night long, And ne'er let harness clink upon thine ears Save only in romaunt and roundelay. Such is what should be, and behold what is! A man of many cares new taken up, To whom there's nothing more can come in life But what is serious and solicitous: One who betakes him to his nuptial bed, His thoughts still busy with the watch and ward, And if his love breathe louder than her wont Starts and believes the bells ring backwards: yes, A man begirt with eighty thousand swords, Scarce knowing which are in the hands of friends And which against him; such a sort of man Thy lover is, his fate for life or death Link'd to a cause which some deem doomed and lost. Such is Van Artevelde, for he is now Chief Captain of the White-Hoods and of Ghent. Clara. Nay! is it even so? Artevelde. Even so it is. Adriana. And you are Captain of these savages! And you will trample with them through the blood Of fellow-men,—alas it may be, too, Of fellow-citizens—for what care they? And you, the gentle-hearted and the good, Must lead these monsters where they will! Artevelde. Not so; I purpose but to lead them where I will. Adriana. Then they will turn upon you; never yet Would they endure a Chief that cross'd their mood. Artevelde. That is the patience they've to learn from me. The times have tamed them, and mischance of late Has forced an iron bit between their teeth By help whereof I hope to rein them round. Clara. Oh, they will murder you! Artevelde. It may be so, But I hope better things. Yet this is sure, That they shall murder me ere make me go The way that is not my way for an inch. Adriana. Alas! and is it come to this!—Oh God! Artevelde. This I foresaw, and things have fallen out No worse than I forewarn'd you that they might. The course I follow is a course ordained; For I feel that within me which accords With what I have to do. The field is fair, And I have no perplexity or cloud Upon my vision. Everything is clear. And take this with you for your comfort too— That man is not the most in tribulation Who, resolute of mind, walks his own way, With answerable skill to plant his steps. Men in their places are the men that stand, And I am strong and stable on my legs; For though full many a care from this time forth Must harbour in my head, my heart is fresh, And there is but one trouble touches it, The fate foreshown for you. Adriana. For me? What fate Could e'er be nobler? Vex not your heart for that, Nor think of me so all unworthily, Nor fancy for me fears I have not: no, In either fortune to be with you still, Still to be with you is the single joy Can find henceforth a corner in my heart; My glory to be ever by your side In weal or woe or danger or distress, In all mishaps or mischiefs that befall you, In all temptations when bad men beset you, In all the tempests that must now rave round you, And, should they wreck you, in the hour of death. If your ambition, late aroused, was that Which push'd you on this perilous attempt, Then I will be ambitious too; if not, And 'twas but your ill-fortune, be it so; Then I will be unfortunate no less. In that will I be like you, and all else Wherein a woman may; what once I prized, Serenity, contentment, heavenly peace, God's blessings on my earlier years bestow'd I fling them to the winds nor heed their loss, So that your love outlast them. Artevelde. Bride in life, And bride in death, if bridals then may be, The last of love for thee were last of all That through this passage of mortality Lights on my soul to Heaven. All will be well; Much happiness shall be thy portion yet; Love will be with thee, breathing his native air, And peace around thee through the power of love. Bring me but through the business of this day— My Lord, your pardon; we consume your time, Which, I'm constrained to say, is short in Ghent. I hitherto have welcomed you amongst us And kept the secret of your sojourns here; So doing, partly for respect to you, And partly for her sake, this foolish girl's, My pretty Clara's, who will let me say I had not pleased her else; but now, my Lord, As you have heard, I hold an office here With duties appertaining, and must needs (With sorrow for your sudden going hence) Proffer my passport,—good till set of sun. D'Arlon. If no discourtesy is meant by this I have but to depart. Clara. Depart! and why? Artevelde. There's nothing meant but honour, nothing else, Howe'er to rude appearances enforced. When there is peace between the Earl and Ghent 'Twill be a joy to me to see again The gallant Lord of Arlon; till that time We meet not, save in hostile ranks opposed, Or captive, I in Bruges or he in Ghent. D'Arlon. Sir, it is not for me to say you nay In a strange town, and all the town your own; Nor would I willingly distrust your word That all is honourably meant; for else I scarce should miss to find a future time For fair requital. Artevelde. On my faith, my Lord, I love you and respect you. D'Arlon. 'Tis enough. Then I depart in peace. Clara. Depart! what's this? What's all the coil about? Say you, depart? That's when I bid him, not an hour before. Dismiss him thus, and ne'er to come again! Then what becomes of me? Oh, I'm a child! I'm to be whipp'd for crying after him? But let me tell you, Philip, I'm the child Of Jacques Artevelde—So look well to it. An injury to myself I might forgive, But one to D'Arlon— [Bursting into tears. Sir, think twice of that, Lest you should lose a sister unawares. D'Arlon. Nay, Clara, nay, be not so troubled. Artevelde. There— You see the humour she is of, my Lord; But be my sins confess'd, the fault is mine. An orphan sister and an only one, What could I less but let her have her will In all things possible? An easy man She still has found me, and knows nothing yet Of opposition to her high commands. You, if you e'er should take her to yourself, May teach her better doctrine. Dry these tears, Clara, my love; nor let this Knight discern His future trials thus presignified In rain and lightning; let him not, my love. Clara (weeping). When will he come again? Artevelde. When peace comes; yes, We'll make him welcome then to bower and hall, And thou shalt twine a garland for his brow Of olive and of laurels won from me. D'Arlon. Be pacified, sweet Clara; dry your tears. He but deals with me as he has the right And deems himself in duty bound; such things Shall jar no string between us. Artevelde. Nobly said. I leave her in your hands, and hope your aid For bringing her to reason. D'Arlon. I entreat One word in private with you ere we part. Artevelde. Take in my sister, Adriana—go, Impart to her a portion of that strength Whereby your spirit, ruler of itself, Rules what betides it: teach her to subdue Her woman's wifulness. [Exeunt Adriana and Clara. D'Arlon. My errand here Is not so wholly idle as no doubt You deem it. I would first have warned you off The office which, with most unhappy haste, Already you have clutch'd. Since that is vain I next would bid you to beware false friends; Look that there be no treason in your camp; I may not now say more; but be assured 'Twill be your life you fight for. Artevelde. Gallant friend, It is a grief to me that we should meet In opposition thus. I'll look around And profit by your warning if I may. Trust me, 'twould irk my heart no less than yours (And may this show in all my acts henceforth!) To enter in alliance with foul play For any earthly meed. Sir, fare you well. D'Arlon. Whenso' the choice and noblest of my friends Are bid to memory's feast, then, Artevelde, The place of honour shall be yours. Farewell. [Exit. Enter the Captain of Artevelde's Guard. Captain. Sir, there's a messenger from Van den Bosch Who craves to see you instantly: another Says the Lord Occo waits your leisure. Artevelde (after a pause). Ha! Lord Occo, saidst thou? Tell me, what of him? Captain. He waits your leisure, Sir. Artevelde. And when comes that? He shall not wait my leisure. And what more? Captain. Sir, Van den Bosch would see you. Artevelde. So he shall: I will attend the Lord of Occo first, And Van den Bosch shall find me at my house Some half hour hence. How look we, Sir, abroad? Captain. The citizens are trooping to the Square. 'Tis said Sir Simon and Sir Guisebert pass From door to door incessantly. Artevelde. To beg? Captain. To gain a strong attendance. Artevelde. Woe the while! A bear, a fiddle, and a pair of apes Had sped the service better. Well; what else? Captain. Both mean and notable and rich and poor Have they solicited, assuring all That when it shall be heard what terms of peace Are offer'd, they will hug the messengers That after painful travail for their love Have brought them such good tidings. Artevelde. Hug them? Ay, With such a hugging as shall stop their breath. But what! Thou look'st not over cheerily; Think'st thou the Knights have made some way then, ha? Captain. The deacons of eight crafts have ta'en their part, And many of the aldermen. Artevelde. Is't so? Captain. And all the men of lineage. Artevelde. As thou hearest. Captain. The citizens pass'd by me in the street By scores and hundreds, and of them I saw The most were plainly not for us. Artevelde. Build up, And then pull down, and then again build up,— And always in the ruins some are—Well? Captain. And I'm afeared, though loth to think it, some Amongst your guard have fallen from their faith At seeing us outnumbered thus. Artevelde. Is't so? Why, wherefore should I wish that it were not? The more faint hearts fall off the better; so Sick fear shall purge us to a sounder health. Now to the Lord of Occo. Follow thou With such as follow me; the rest discard. Scene IV. —The Dwelling-house of the Lord of Occo. Occo and Van Aeswyn. Occo. The mariners, then, are for us? Aeswyn. They are ours. Occo. And these are of the curriers that thou bring'st? Aeswyn. The deacons of that craft—they're backward still: They're ever harping upon Artevelde, Who told their worships when they took the oath If his poor humour govern'd, nothing else But leathern jerkins should be worn in Ghent. Occo. We'll deal with them as with the fullers; go And bring them in. [Exit Van Aeswyn. Well done, Sir Curriers! These precious moments must be given to you! The Devil curry you for senseless boors! Re-enter Van Aeswyn with the two Craftsmen. Good morrow, Masters—Ha! my valued friend, Jacob Van Ryk; and if mine eyes see true, Master— Aeswyn. Van Muck. Occo. Tush, tush, Sir! tell not me; Have I forgotten my old friend Van Muck, Or any of my friends?—though time is short And we must scant our greetings. Worthy Sirs, We're in a perilous predicament, And I should take no step without advice. Rash were it, and a tempting Providence, Should I proceed without consulting you. We see, Sirs, we must see, we can't but own, That we have no choice left us but of peace Or else destruction. It is come to that. Then if we must be subject to the Earl, I will confess I'm not so subtle-witted To see much difference 'twixt this hour and that, The going over to him now at once With flesh upon our bones, or holding back Till famine wastes it or steel hacks it off: I see no difference. Van Muck. Truly, Sir, nor I. Occo. Ay, but there is a difference, my friends, Which I forgot. For, hark you in your ear! Those who go over but when all go over, If they escape from pains and penalties, Can scarcely claim much merit with the Earl; But they who find a guidance for themselves, Who take a step or two before the herd, Whilst the will's free. who lead, not follow,—these Have rightful claims; yes, boldly these may say Reward us, for the first and foremost we; Nor will they be unanswer'd, that I know: “First serve the first,” is what they say at Bruges. Van Ryk. 'Tis a good proverb, Sir, for early men; And we have ne'er been slack in things of credit; But we have scruples here. We see it thus: If we should but shout peace with half the town The Earl would scarce take count of us; again, Should we make haste in raising of our hands Against our friends, they'd call us renegades, And blacken us for false and treacherous knaves. Occo. Why, look ye now; too surely, should ye shout, And fail in action, 'twere no singular service; There's no great guerdon were deserved by that; The clerkships of the wards (which after peace Must be new fill'd) would not be won by shouts: But where's the treachery? My worthy friends, Look at the matter simply as it is: Here is a town beleaguer'd in such wise That it must needs surrender upon terms: Then come a lot of desperate-minded men, Who, deeming the rendition gives up them To punishment, make head against the rest: These think no shame to say that all must die To save their one—two—three—half-dozen heads From certain hazards. Why if fall they must, And they would rather 'twere by steel than cord, Let them assail us and let us be men! Are we not free to choose 'twixt peace and war? They—they it is that are so treacherous—they, Who would betray a city to its doom For private and particular ends of theirs. Then let us rally round the public weal And link our names with that. Van Ryk. The city's weal Doth one way beckon us, it must be own'd; But some of us there are that but last night Swore fealty to Artevelde. Occo. What then? That was but for the war—not knowing then That it was ended by your deputies And peace concluded: answer not so idly. Swore ye not fealty to the Earl before? Come, come, my friends—we're all as one, I see; And let me tell you that the whole of Ghent, Almost the whole, is minded like yourselves. Strange is it men shall meditate and muse In secret all alike, and show no sign Till a blow's struck, and then they speak it out, And each man finds in each his counterpart, And, as a sluice were opened, all shall rush To find the self-same level and pour on To the same end. But I forgot, my friends; We have to think of what particular mark Should first be aim'd at when the blow is struck. Van Ryk. So please you, Sir, a cast at Van den Bosch Were not amiss, methinks. Occo. Well shot, Van Ryk; But yet not quite the bull's eye. Van Muck. By the mass, He's shot the bull he had his horns of—Ha! What will Dame Oda say to thee? Van Ryk. Come, come! If that's our archery, Frans Fleisch for thee. Occo. My friends, we'll settle all such scores at will. But is not Ghent more precious than our wives? And who debauches her? When she was fain To creep into her long-left Lord's embrace, Who came at night and whistled her away? This is the aggravation that most stirs The choler of the Earl. The other Chiefs, Men that by accidents and long degrees Became entangled in rebellion,—them He can forgive; but he that plunged plump in And so new troubled what was settling down, This is the man that he has mark'd for death. Whoso brings down that head has hit a mark That's worth five hundred crowns. What say you, friends? Who strikes a good stroke with his sword for this? [A pause. To speak it with no mincing of the sense, Van Artevelde, you understand, must die; His life the Earl must have. Who hath the guerdon Is not of moment save to them that get it; But truly were the money on my head, And I as sure to die as Artevelde, I'd rather men like you should win the prize Than see it snatch'd by luck; when die we must, 'Tis better that thereby good men should thrive Than snatchers. Van Ryk. Saving your displeasure, Sir, 'Tis said good men ne'er thrive but by good deeds. Now, were it but the slaying Van den Bosch, Or Peter Nuitre, or Frans Ackerman, There's husbands, widows, orphans, all through Ghent Would say the deed was good: but Artevelde Has, as it were, a creditable name, And men would say we struck not for revenge But only lucre, which were scandalous; And also, Sir— Occo (to a Serving-man who enters). What, sirrah?—Speak—what now? [The Serving-man whispers him. Van Artevelde! what say'st thou?—coming here? Not now—not now? Serving-man. Now, instantly, my Lord. Occo. Masters, I wish you both good-day—good-day, God prosper thee, Van Ryk—Van Muck, farewell. Why op'st thou not the door, thou villain groom? Think'st thou the burgesses have time to lose? Farewell at once, Sirs—not to keep you here When things are all so stirring in the town; You're needed at your posts, I know; farewell. Van Ryk. My Lord, as touching these five hundred crowns— Occo. Just as ye will, Sirs—any way ye please; I bid God speed you, and so fare ye well. Van Ryk. If you would take four hundred from the five, And set the residue on Van den Bosch, His head I'd bring you in for that much coin, And Ackerman's for love and pure good-will. Van Muck. And Sir, as touching Artevelde— Occo. Nay, nay, I will not press it further. Van Muck. If the crowns— Occo. Peace, on your lives, he's here! Enter Artevelde. Artevelde. My Lord of Occo, at your pleasure. Ha! Attended, too, as I could wish. God's love! I'd not desire to see a friend of mine Better accompanied,—no, nor a foe Better encounter'd, than by men like these. Jacob Van Ryk, my father loved you much; No man knew better, Jacob, none than he, Who were the worthiest of his love and trust, And I, thou seest, have mounted to his seat. How the old times come back upon me now! I was a very little prating child When thou wert of his escort to and fro From post to pillar: it was always thou Whom he would choose from them that brought him home To ask thy company; and in thine arms He oft would put me for his more repose, For I was stillest there. Times change, Van Ryk; Years shift us up and down; but something sticks; And for myself, there's nothing as a man That I love more than what my childhood loved. Honest Van Muck, thy hand—thou look'st abash'd— Ah, thou bethink'st thee of thy little debt, The money that I lent thee for the close. Why, what of that, man? Didst thou ever hear An Artevelde would hurt his friend for gold? Thy debt is cancell'd—think of it no more; Thou shalt look boldly upward in the world And care for no man. I will settle that This instant with a writing. Occo. By your leave, The burgesses are tarried for elsewhere; They are incontinently going hence; You will forgive their haste, they cannot stay; Open the doors. Good-day, Sirs, once again. Van Muck. Master Van Artevelde, I'm your debtor more Than ever I was yet. God guard you, Sir, And specially in your perils near at hand! Van Ryk. Master Van Artevelde, God grant you grace To read men's hearts,—the gift your father had. Look for your friends amongst the Commons ever; An 'twere not for Lord Occo standing here, I'd bid you trust in ne'er a Lord of Ghent. [Exeunt the Craftsmen. Artevelde (after a pause). These are ambiguous knaves. Occo. True craftsmen both! Ever suspicious of nobility. Artevelde. That am not I. You had some news to tell, So your Lieutenant said. Occo. Intelligence Has reach'd me of the terms the Earl will grant; A guarantee of franchises and rights Conditional on some three hundred souls Being surrender'd to his mercy. Artevelde. Ay; Of whom then is this number? Occo. Whom the Earl May please to name hereafter; but meanwhile The lists are written out, though not divulged; And what is worthiest note, upon the file Your name appears not. Artevelde. By my faith, that's strange! But are the tidings sure? Occo. Beyond all doubt. Artevelde. How came you by them, if they be so sure? Occo. They're rumour'd—confidently rumour'd—Nay, I had them also from my spies at Bruges; A most sagacious spy—he saw the lists; He never vet deceived me—there's no doubt. Artevelde. And what do you advise, if this be truth? Occo. Why, if the town be obstinately bent On making peace, my counsel to yourself, Whose life peace places not in jeopardy, Would be to leave the forward part to us Whose only safety lies in holding out; So that, if we should fall, you still may stand, Whatever turn things take. And bear in mind, If there be danger and the crafts revolt, To throw yourself among the mariners: There's none of all the crafts so wholly with us? Artevelde. With which of us, my Lord? Occo. With one and all. Artevelde. Ay, say you so? And my part, as you think, Is to stand back and see you play the game. I have a notion of a leader's part That looks another way. Your counsel asked Not wholly without profit have I heard: Now I will give you mine; and be you pleased To profit in like sort lest worse befall you I too have had my spies upon the watch, And what they brought me sounded in my ears A note of warning link'd with names well known, Now known for traitors' names. I hereupon Took order for a numerous company Selected for their hardihood and faith To be for ever close upon the heels Of these same traitors at all guild-assemblies, And use their weapons on a sign from me. Which matters recommending to your care I counsel you to stay at home. Farewell. [Exit. Enter Van Aeswyn. Aeswyn. My Lord, Sir Guisebert is impatient much, And sends one message on another's heels To ask why tarry you? Occo. I am not well. Aeswyn. But they must needs set forth at once; ere this The market-place is full; they cannot wait. Occo. Hark you! he knows it all. Aeswyn. Van Artevelde? Occo. Knows everything. Aeswyn. And what is to be done? Occo. I'm ill at ease; I know not; what think'st thou? Aeswyn. If he but knew it half-an-hour too soon, His knowledge is of small account. Occo. God's death! But who can tell how long he's known it—nay, How many he have practised with and gain'd— How many may have falsely seem'd to swerve By his direction, only to delude And so embolden me to my defeat. I would this hour were over! Aeswyn. Choose your course; Take one part or the other, lest it pass, And leave you ruined both ways. Occo. Ruin'd! Ruin'd! He told me if I ventured to the Square His followers should slay me. Aeswyn. Yours may him; 'Tis a fair challenge, let us fight it out. Occo. Why, that is bravely said. Then be it so; Thou shalt have warranty to fight it out; And if we're beaten, I shall stand prepared To fly to Bruges with any that way bent. And hark you, friend! not empty-handed, no, We'll take what's worth our ransom ten times told,— A damsel whom thou wot'st of. Pick me out Ten of the sturdiest of my body-guard, Van Truckler and Van Linden at their head; Bid them have horses and a litter near. Shouldst thou be worsted in the market-place I will be nigh thee to protect thy flight Till thou mayst reach the gates. God speed thee well! [Exit. Aeswyn. The dastard! when the service touches life The follower must lead, and venture all For him that ventures nothing. Are we fools? Scene V. —The House Van Artevelde.—Artevelde and the Page. Artevelde. Not to be fear'd—Give me my sword! Go forth, And see what folk be these that throng the street. [Exit Page. Not to be fear'd is to be nothing here: And wherefore have I taken up this charge If I be nothing in it? There they go. [Shouts are heard. Of them that pass my house some shout my name, But the most part pass silently; and once I heard the cry of “Flanders and the Lion.” Re-enter Page. Page. The Knights that newly have arrived from Bruges Pass down the street, my Lord, with many more. Artevelde. Give me my cloak and dagger! There, enough— Thy service is perform'd. Go to thy sports, But come not near the market-place to-day. [Exit Page. To be the chief of honourable men Is honour; and if dangerous, yet faith Still binds them faster as the danger grows. To be the head of villains,—what is that But to be mind to an unwholesome body— To render up God's gift a human soul In sad metempsychosis to the brutes, Whose carrion, else exanimate, but gains A moment's life from this, then so infects That all together die the death of beasts. [A pause. These hands are spotless yet— Yea, white as when in infancy they strayed Unconscious o'er my mother's face, or closed With that small grasp which mothers love to feel. No stain has come upon them since that time— They have done nothing violent—first and last Of a calm will untroubled servants they, And went about their offices, if here I must not say in purity, in peace. But he they served,—he is not what he was. [A party pass the window, and a voice cries, “The Lion for Flanders!” That cry again! Then be it as ye will! Sir Knights, ye drive me close upon the rocks, And of my cargo you're the vilest bales, So overboard with you! What, men of blood! Can the son better auspicate his arms Than by the slaying of who slew the father? Some blood may flow because that it needs must, But yours by choice—I'll slay you and thank God. Enter Van den Bosch. Van den Bosch. The common bell hath rung! the Knights are there; Thou must come instantly. Artevelde. I come—I come. Van den Bosch. Now, Master Philip, if thou miss thy way Through this affair, we're lost. 'Tis blood for blood— Be counsell'd now by me; have thou in mind— Artevelde. Enough; I need not counsel; I'm resolved. Take thou thy stand beside Sir Simon Bette, As I by Grutt! take note of all I do, And do thyself accordingly. All's said. Scene VI —The exterior of the Stadt-House. Two external flights of stone stairs meet in a landing-place or platform midway in the front of the building. On this platform appear Sir Guisebert Grutt, with the aldermen of sundry guilds and the deans of the several crafts of butchers, fishermen, glaziers, and cordwainers. Also Frans Ackerman, Van Nuitre, and others of the White-Hood party. A Weaver. Speak up, Sir Guisebert; speak, Sir Guisebert Grutt. A Fuller. Sir Simon Bette,—we'll hear Sir Simon first. A White-Hood. Not to waste time, let's hear them both at once; For bawling as we do, one word in ten Were much to reach us. A Glazier. It is you that bawl, You villain White-Hoods—And there come the men That teach it you; but we've a muster here Shall choke your bawling with a churchyard sod. Enter Van Artevelde and Van Den Bosch. Artevelde. Well met, my friends, if friends you be; if not, Why then, well met, my foes. Sir Guisebert (descending some steps to meet Sir Simon Bette, who comes up from the street). I' the name of God! Where is the Lord of Occo? Sir Simon. Sick, Sir, sick. He has sent word he's sick and cannot come. Sir Guisebert. Pray God his sickness be his death! Sir Simon. Amen! But his Lieutenant and his troop are here. Van den Bosch (aside to Artevelde) There's something that has staggered them: Up, up, And push them to the point. [Aloud.] Make way there, Ho! Artevelde (coming forward). Some citizen hath brought this concourse here; Who is the man, and what hath he to say? Sir Guisebert. The noble Earl of Flanders of his grace Commisions me to speak. [Some White-Hoods interrupt him with cries of “Ghent!” which are presently lost in the cry of “Flanders!” Artevelde. What, silence! peace! Silence, and hear this noble Earl's behests, Deliver'd by this thrice puissant Knight. Sir Guisebert. First will I speak—not what I'm bid to say, But what it most imports yourselves to hear. For though ye cannot choose but know it well, Yet by these cries I deem that some there are Would, much like madmen, cast their knowledge off, And both of that and of their reason reft Run naked on the sword—which to forefend, Let me remind you of the things ye know. Sirs, when this month began ye had four Chiefs Of great renown and valour,—Jan de Bol, Arnoul le Clerc, and Launoy and Van Ranst: Where are they now? and what be ye without them? Sirs, when the month began ye had good aid From Brabant, Liege, Dinant, St. Tron, and Huy: How shall they serve you now? The Earl sits fast Upon the Quatre-metiers and the Bridge: What aid of theirs can reach you? What supplies? I tell you, Sirs, that thirty thousand men Could barely bring a bullock to your gates. If thus without, how stand ye then within? Ask of your Chatelain, the Lord of Occo; Which worthy Knight will tell you— Artevelde. (aside to Van den Bosch) Mark you that? [Then aloud to Sir Guisebert.] Where is this sponsor of your speech—where is he? Sir Guisebert. He's sick in bed; but were he here, he'd say, There's not provision in the public stores To keep you for a week. Such is your plight. Now hear the offer of your natural Liege. Moved to compassion by our prayers and tears, By good Duke Aubert aided, and with him My Lady of Brabant and Lord Compelant— To whom our thanks are due,—the Earl says thus: He will have peace, and take you to his love, And be your good Lord as in former days; And all the injuries, hatreds, and ill-will He had against you he will now forget, And he will pardon you your past misdeeds, And he will keep you in your ancient rights; And for his love and graces thus vouchsafed He doth demand of you three hundred men, Such citizens of Ghent as he shall name, To be surrendered and abide his will. Van den Bosch. Three hundred citizens! Artevelde. Peace, Van den Bosch. Hear we this other Knight. Well, worthy Sir, Hast aught to say, or hast not got thy priming, That thus thou gaspest like a droughty pump? Van den Bosch. Nay, 'tis black bile that chokes him. Come, up with it! Be it but a gallon it shall ease thy stomach. Several Citizens. Silence! Sir Simon Bette's about to speak. Sir Simon. Right worthy Burgesses, good men and rich! Much trouble ye may guess, and strife had we To win his Highness to this loving humour; For if ye rightly think, Sirs, and remember, You've done him much offence—not of yourselves, But through ill guidance of ungracious men. For first ye slew his Bailiff at the cross, And with the Earl's own banner in his hand, Which falling down was trampled under foot Through heedlessness of them that stood about. Also ye burn'd the castle he loved best And ravaged all his parks at Andrehen, All those delightful gardens on the plain: And ye beat down two gates at Oudenarde And in the dike ye cast them upside down: Also ye slew five Knights of his, and worse Ye brake the font wherein he was baptized. Wherefore it must be own'd, Sirs, that much cause He had of quarrel with the town of Ghent. For what, Sirs, had ye suffered from the Earl That ye should thus dishonour him? 'Tis true At Erclo once a Burgess was detain'd Through misbehaviour of the Bailiff; still He hath deliver'd many a time and oft Out of his prisons Burgesses of yours Only to do you pleasure; and when late By kinsmen of the Bailiff whom ye slew Some mariners of yours were sorely maim'd, (Which was an inconvenience to this town,) What did the Earl? To prove it not his act He banish'd out of Flanders them that did it. Moreover, Sirs, the taxes of the Earl Were not so heavy, but that, being rich, Ye might have borne them; they were not the half Of what ye since have paid to wage this war; And yet had these been double that were half, The double would have grieved you less in peace Than but the half in war. Bethink ye, Sirs, What were the fowage and the subsidies When bread was but four mites that's now a groat? All which consider'd, Sirs, I counsel you That ye accept this honourable peace, For mercifully is the Earl inclined, And ye may surely deem of them he takes A large and liberal number will be spared, And many here who least expect his love May find him-free and gracious. Sirs, what say ye? Artevelde. First, if it be your pleasure, hear me speak. [Great tumult and cries of “Flanders!” What, Sirs, not hear me? was it then for this Ye made me your chief Captain yesternight,— To snare me in a trust, whereof I bear The name aud danger only, not the power? [The tumult increases. Sirs, if we needs must come to blows, so be it; For I have friends can deal them. Sir Simon (aside to Sir Guisebert). Mercy! No— Had Occo now been here! but lacking him It must not come to that. Sir Guisebert. My loving friends, Let us behave like brethren as we are, And not like listed combatants. Ho, peace! Hear this young bachelor of high renown, Who writes himself your Captain since last night, When a few score of varlets, being drunk, In mirth and sport so dubbed him. Peace, Sirs, peace! Artevelde. Peace let it be, if so ye will; if not, We are as ready as yourselves for blows. One of the Citizens. Speak, Master Philip, speak, and you'll be heard. Artevelde. I thank you, Sirs; I knew it could not be But men like you must listen to the truth. Sirs, ye have heard these Knights discourse to you Of your ill fortunes, numbering in their glee The worthy leaders ye have lately lost: True, they were worthy men, most gallant chiefs, And ill would it become us to make light Of the great loss we suffer by their fall: They died like heroes; for no recreant step Had e'er dishonour'd them,—no stain of fear, No base despair, no cowardly recoil: They had the hearts of freemen to the last, And the free blood that bounded in their veins Was shed for freedom with a liberal joy. But had they guess'd, or could they but have dream'd, The great examples which they died to show Should fall so flat, should shine so fruitless here, That men should say, “For liberty these died, Wherefore let us be slaves,”—had they thought this, Oh then with what an agony of shame Their blushing faces buried in the dust Had their great spirits parted hence for heaven! What! shall we teach our chroniclers henceforth To write that in five bodies were contain'd The sole brave hearts of Ghent! which five defunct, The heartless town by brainless counsel led Deliver'd up her keys, stript off her robes, And so with all humility besought Her haughty Lord to scourge her lightly! No, It shall not be—no verily! for now, Thus looking on you as ye gather round, Mine eye can single out full many a man Who lacks but opportunity to shine As great and glorious as the chiefs that fell. But lo! the Earl is mercifully moved! And surely if we, rather than revenge The slaughter of our bravest, cry them shame, And fall upon our knees, and say we've sinn'd, Then will the Earl take pity on his thralls And pardon us our letch for liberty! What pardon it shall be, if we know not, Yet Ypres, Courtray, Grammont, Bruges, they know; For never can those towns forget the day When by the hangman's hands five hundred men, The bravest of each guild, were done to death In those base butcheries that he call'd pardons. And did it seal their pardons, all this blood? Had they the Earl's good love from that time forth? Oh, Sirs! look round you lest ye be deceived; Forgiveness may be spoken with the tongue, Forgiveness may be written with the pen, But think not that the parchment and mouth pardon Will e'er eject old hatreds from the heart. There's that betwixt you been men ne'er forget Till they forget themselves, till all's forgot, Till the deep sleep falls on them in that bed From which no morrow's mischief knocks them up. There's that betwixt you been which you yourselves, Should ye forget, would then not be yourselves; For must it not be thought some base men's souls Have ta'en the seats of yours and turn'd you out If in the coldness of a craven heart Ye should forgive this bloody-minded man For all his black and murderous monstrous crimes? Think of your mariners, three hundred men, After long absence in the Indian seas, Upon their peaceful homeward voyage bound, And now, all dangers conquer'd as they thought, Warping the vessels up their native stream, Their wives and children waiting them at home In joy, with festal preparation made,— Think of these mariners, their eyes torn out, Their hands chopp'd off, turn'd staggering into Ghent To meet the blasted eye-sight of their friends! And was not this the Earl? 'Twas none but he! No Hauterive of them all had dared to do it Save at the express instance of the Earl. And now what asks he? Pardon me, Sir Knights, [To Grutt and Bette. I had forgotten, looking back and back From felony to felony foregoing, This present civil message which ye bring: Three hundred citizens to be surrender'd Up to that mercy which I tell you of— That mercy which your mariners proved—which steep'd Courtray and Ypres, Grammont, Bruges, in blood! Three hundred citizens,—a secret list— No man knows who—not one can say he's safe— Not one of you so humble but that still The malice of some secret enemy May whisper him to death—and hark—look to it! Have some of you seem'd braver than their peers, Their courage is their surest condemnation; They are marked men—and not a man stands here But may be so.—Your pardon, Sirs, again! [To Grutt and Bette. You are the pickers and the choosers here, And doubtless you're all safe, ye think—ha! ha! But we have pick'd and chosen, too, Sir Knights— What was the law for I made yesterday— What! is it you that would deliver up Three hundred citizens to certain death? Ho! Van den Bosch! have at these traitors—there— [Stabs Grutt, who falls. Van den Bosch. Die, treasonable dog—is that enough? Down, felon, and plot treacheries in Hell. [stabs Bette. [The White-Hoods draw their swords, with loud cries of “Treason!” “Artevelde!” and “Ghent!” A citizen of the other party, who in the former part of the scene had unfurled the Earl's banner, now throws it down and flies; several others are following him, and the Aldermen and Deans, some of whom had been dropping off towards the end of Artevelde's speech, now quit the platform in haste. Van Aeswyn is crossed by Van Den Bosch. Van den Bosch. Die, thou, too, traitor. [Aiming a blow at him. Artevelde (warding it off). Van den Bosch, forbear. Up with your weapons, White-Hoods; no more blood. These only are the guilty who lie here. Let no more blood be spilt on pain of death. Sirs, ye have nought to fear; I say, stand fast; No man shall harm you; if he does, he dies. Stand fast, or if ye go, take with you this,— Philip Van Artevelde is friend with all; There's no man lives within the walls of Ghent But Artevelde will look to him and his And suffer none to touch his goods or him. Haste, Van den Bosch! by Heav'n they run like hares! Take they not heart the sooner, by St. Paul They'll fly the city, and that cripples us. Haste with thy company to the west wards And see thou that no violence be done Amongst the weavers and the fullers—stay— And any that betake themselves to spoil Hang without stint—and hark—begone—yet stay; Shut the west gate, postern and wicket too, And catch my Lord of Occo where thou canst,— Stay—on thy life let no man's house be forced. Van den Bosch. That is not to my mind; but have thy way. Thou'st play'd the game right boldly, and for me, I've sworn to stead thee,—and what's more, I will. Artevelde. Thou to thine errand, then, and I myself Will go from street to street through all the town To reassure the citizens; that done, I'll meet thee here again. Form, White-Hoods, form: Range ten abreast; I'm coming down; but stay— You Floris, Leefdale, Spanghen, mount ye here, And bear me down these bodies. Now, set forth. ACT III. Scene I. —Night. A Wood near Bruges. The Lord of Occo and Followers. Occo. No more than half a league to Bruges? then halt, And let the men-at-arms be drawn together Where the ground's open. Berckel, ride thou on And hail the warders on the walls; make known That for the love which we have shown the Earl We're driven forth of Ghent, and humbly crave His hospitality. [To Van Aeswyn, who enters. Van Aeswyn! What? Where is the litter? Van Aeswyn. Dropped some mile behind To rest the bearers. Occo. Lazy, loitering rogues! What of the Lady? Van Aeswyn. Still much moved. Occo. Go back; Keep thou beside her, lest she should prevail To make the varlets speak. Let none approach After we pass the gates but men of mine, Nor ever let the litter be unclosed. Now, if we're all in order, march we on. Scene II. —A Banqueting Hall in the Stadt-House at Bruges. Tables are spread, and the Earl of Flanders, the Hase of Flanders, with several Lords, Knights, and followers of the Earl, are entertained by the Mayor of Bruges and the Aldermen. Earl. Sir Mayor, we thank you; 'tis a royal feast. Mayor. My gracious Lord, the supper is but poor; Very exceeding poor the supper is; And yet the most we can; your humble hosts, Being but meagre citizens God wot, Can but purvey your Highness what they have, A very sorry supper. Alderman. True indeed. Yet if your Highness please to cast it up, A hundred florins— Mayor. Hold thy peace, Van Holst; The minstrels twang their cat-gut. Earl . (aside to the Hase) In good time; If aught could make me cast my supper up 'Twere to taste further of their courtesies. Soho, Sir Minstrel! what hast got to sing? Van Holst. That has been cared for, please your Highness; yes, We knew your Highness had a skilful ear, And 'twas not every poesy would please. This is a ditty craftily conceited, Trump'd up as 'twere extempore for the nonce! He was no tavern cantabank that made it, But a Squire Minstrel of your Highness's court. So—sing, Sir Minstrel—there you have it—ah! Fal-lal—the very thing—the tune's “Green Sleeves.” THE MINSTREL SINGS. The little bird sat on the greenwood tree, And the sun was as bright as bright could be; The leaf was broad, the shade was deep, The Lion of Flanders lay fast asleep. The little bird sang, “Sir Lion, arise, For I hear with my ears and I see with my eyes, And I know what I know, and I tell thee this, That the men of Ghent have done something amiss.” From his lair the Lion of Flanders rose, And he shook his mane and toss'd up his nose; “Ere a leaf be fallen or summer be spent,” Quoth he, “if God spare me, I'll go to Ghent. “For a little bird sang and I dream'd beside That the people of Ghent were puff'd up with pride; And I had been far over hill and dale And was fast asleep, and they trod on my tail.” Ere a leaf was fallen the Lion he went And growl'd a growl at the gates of Ghent: But they bended low when they saw him awake, And said that they trod on his tail by mistake. The little bird sat on the bush so bare And the leaf fell brown on the Lion's lair; The little bird pick'd a berry so red And dropp'd it down on the Lion's head. “Sir Lion, awake, and put out your claws, And lift your chin from your tawny paws; My ears are smaller than yours, but more I hear than you, and worse than before.” The Lion stirr'd and awoke with a snort, And swelled with rage till his breath came short; “Ere the brown leaf meet with the flake of snow On the roundabout stair, to Ghent I'll go. “For a little bird sang, and I dream'd as well, That the people of Ghent were as false as Hell; Coming by stealth when nought I fear'd, They trod on my corns and pull'd my beard.” Ere a snow-flake fell the Lion he went And roar'd a roar at the gates of Ghent; The gates they shook though they were fast barr'd, And the warders heard it at Oudenarde. At the first roar ten thousand men Fell sick to death—he roar'd again, And the blood of twenty thousand flow'd On the bridge of Roone, as broad as the road. Woe worth thee, Ghent! if, having heard The first and second, thou bidest the third! Flat stones and awry, grass, potsherd and shard, Thy place shall be like an old churchyard. Earl. A singular good song and daintily accompanied with the music. Give him three florins and a denier for the lad withal. Van Holst. Your Highness is too bountiful. He made it not himself. 'Twas your Highness's Serjeant-Minstrel that made it. The making and mending of it together was seven days and nights, bating twelve hours for sleeping, and four hours for eating, and five minutes for saying his prayers. Drinking never stopped him, for still the more he drank the more he made of it. And he ranted and sang, an' it like your Highness, that it would have pleased you to hear him; for being that the song was made in honour of your Highness, he said he could sing it a thousand times over and think better of it every time. Earl. It is good poesy—marry and good prophecy too. Hark you, Master Mayor; I have somewhat repented me that I was wrought upon by those old Knights of Ghent to proffer terms of such easy acquittance. Mayor. When your Highness is graciously pleased to give away your advantages, it is not for such as I to say you do wrong; but every man in Bruges that is well affected to your Highness said that three hundred heads was too little. Earl. By my faith they said true; and Gilbert Matthew told me no less; but I was persuaded by the old Knights; I was too easy with them. Where is Gilbert Matthew? Gilbert. Here, my Lord. Earl. Come hither, Gilbert. I have bethought me, Gilbert, I almost sinn'd against true chivalry To let yon rabble off. Gilbert. Your Highness says it. Earl. Thou'dst tell me 'twas not by thy counsels. Gilbert. Sir, As many heads of each insurgent craft Would not have been denied. A hundred nail'd Like weasels to the gates of each wall'd town Thorough the States of Flanders—that had been A warning wholesome and significant To the good towns. Earl. A salutary sign. I would the bargain were to make again. Why so now! who comes here? Sir Walter? Yes. Enter Sir Walter D'Arlon. D'Arlon, I never see thee but with joy. What new adventure hast thou been upon? We miss thee oft at Court, but thy return Is ever with new honours at thy heels. What captives follow thee to Bruges to-night? Or hast thou turn'd base metal into gold And bring'st their ransoms?—either way is well. D'Arlon. My Lord, I come alone. Earl. Why, welcome still! D'Arlon. Yet there is something following at my heels Which hardly shall your Highness in like sort Make welcome here. Earl. Why, say'st thou? what is that? D'Arlon. Ill rumours, my good Lord. Earl. Ill rumours? how? D'Arlon. The rebels are alive again and fresh. The messengers of peace lie stabb'd to death Upon the steps i' the market-place. Earl. Not so! It cannot be;—D'Arlon, it must be false. D'Arlon. I fear, my Lord, it will not so be found. Earl. Nay, nay,—so stripp'd of everything—so bare As we had made them—scarce a leader left, And those that were, so wild and scant of skill! D'Arlon. That were an ugly breach if not repair'd. They've made young Artevelde their chief. Earl. God help them! A man that as much knowledge has of war As I of brewing mead! God help their souls! A bookish nursling of the monks—a meacock! D'Arlon. My Lord, I'm fearful you mistake the man. If my accounts be true, the life he's led Served rather in its transit to eclipse Than to show forth his nature; and, that pass'd, You'll now behold him as he truly is, One of a cold and of a constant mind, Not quicken'd into ardent action soon, Nor prompt for petty enterprise, yet bold, Fierce when need is, and capable. Earl. Thou sayst? And hath he slain the Knights! D'Arlon. With his own hand. Earl. I tell thee it is false; it cannot be. Thou, Gilbert Matthew, what think'st thou? Gilbert. My Lord, It may be there's some skirmishing at Ghent, Which rumour, floating like a mist before, Augments to this. Earl. Thou deem'st there's nought to fear? Gilbert. I deem of Ghent as of a winter fly That in a gleam of sunshine creeping forth Kicks with stiff legs a feeble stroke or two And falls upon its back. Earl. Then all is well. Gilbert, thy wisdom never was at fault. A comfortable councillor art thou. Sirrah, what news? [To an Attendant who enters. Attendant. The Lord of Occo, Sir, Came with his men-at-arms before the walls, And being that he was driven forth of Ghent, The warders have admitted him, and here He waits your pleasure. Earl. Bid him in at once. He comes like confirmation. Oh Ghent! Ghent! Oh ye ungracious people! Enter the Lord of Occo. Speak, Sir Guy; Out with the worst, for I have guessed it all. Fame was here first as breathless as you are. Occo. 'Tis the worst fortune e'er befell me yet To be the bearer of this heavy news. Our friends are slain, the White-Hoods hold the town, And he, the homicide whose bloody hand Despatch'd the peaceful Knights, is Lord of all. Earl. Oh that unhappy people! hear me, God! Hear me, ye Host of Heaven and all good men! If e'er I lift the wine-cup to my lips, If ever other than a soldier's bed Contain me, or if any pleasant sport Inveigle off my heart while that town stands, May I be driven from my royalties To dwell with beasts like him that sinn'd of old! Rise, Sirs; no more of feasting here. Sir Guy, Such entertainment as such times afford We'll give you. Bid my chamberlain see to it. Adieu, Sirs; when the walls of Ghent lie flat Our revel we resume. D'Arlon. Leave me, my Lord, The entertainment of your friends from Ghent; My house will hold them.—[Aside.]Grant me this, my Lord; They need a supervisor. Earl. Good;—Sir Guy, Sir Walter D'Arlon is your host at Bruges. At noon to-morrow come to Council, Sirs, You that are of it. Minstrel, stand aside— What! are you blind? Good night, good night, adieu. Scene III. —A Chamber in the Lord of Arlon's House. Adriana Van Merestyn and three Attendants in the Lord of Occo's livery. Adriana. Whither have you brought me, Sirs? What house is this? Nay, must I ask for ever? Wilt not speak? Nor thou, nor thou? If ye are bid be dumb, But say ye are so, and I'll ask no more. First Attendant. Madam, we are. Adriana. Who bid you?—not a word? If you're afraid to tell me, make a sign. Was it the Lord of Occo? 'Twas not he? Then whosoe'er enjoin'd it, send him here. Entreat him were it but for courtesy To come to me. He that hath tied your tongues May loose them or be free to use his own. I pray thee send him; thou art not so rude, To guess thee by thy mien, as this so slight, So slender service to deny me—no— Or else thou wear'st a mask. [The first Attendant goes out. She turns aside from the others. Befriend me now, Heart, head, and tongue, if life is left them still. Oh for some potion that for one hour's space Should make me twice myself! Enter Van Aeswyn. Aeswyn (to the Attendants.) Depart the chamber. [Exeunt Attendants. Adriana. Master Van Aeswyn! Aeswyn. Madam! Adriana. It is thou That thus abusest me! Aeswyn. I, Madam! No; I have done nothing; if a wrong there be, It lies with others; I have but obey'd Whom I am bound to serve. Adriana. Alas! thy guilt Is but more abject, being ministrant Unto another's, and thyself no less Accountable to Heaven. His lust and greed Whom thou abettest thou dost make thine own And nothing gett'st but wages of thy work To pay thy sin. What! is't not shame on shame? Thou puttest thine immortal soul to sale For profit of another, thy reward Being the sorry guerdon of a Squire With blot and stain of such addition vile Of countenance and favour, bred of guilt, As he that uses thee may please to show thee. Oh soil of bad men's service! Thou to stamp A gentle name with stigma of such deeds! Oh curse of bad men's hire! Aeswyn. Nay, Madam, nay, 'Tis not for countenance, still less for hire: But I have taken service with this Lord, And by the law of arms— Adriana. What law is that? 'Tis not the law of God, nor yet above it. Aeswyn. An honest Squire is bound by plighted faith And by the law of arms, to execute His Lord's behests. Adriana. Though they be base and foul And cowardly and craven? Law of arms! Grant 'twere that law supernal it is not, Yet dost thou break it, for all wrongs to women Stand in its code denounced. Aeswyn. By all that's just The deed misliked me from the first; three times I pray'd his Lordship to bethink himself What quittance he should hazard and what blame In wronging of so rich and good a lady; But still he said the Earl should bring him through Let come what might; insisting that by law You were in wardship, and his Grace might grant Your hand to whom was fittest. Adriana. Oh blind craft And ignorance of covetous knaves! They err. Me shall no earthly Prince nor Potentate Toss like a morsel of his broken meat To any supplicant. Be they advised I am in wardship to the King of Kings; God and my heart alone dispose of me. Aeswyn. Madam, I would it were so. Adriana. Say besides The Earl should cast the mantle of his power Over thy master, what shall cover thee, That canst not borrow greatness for the cloak Of evil deeds, from naked, manifest shame? Lo, here I stand in jeopardy and fear, Weak, trembling, sick at heart, and wearied so With perturbation and with pain so rack'd That I have lost my patience and for hours Have pray'd for God's deliverance through death; Yet rather would I, yea, far rather, live A dateless life of anguish such as this, Rather live out my reason thus and twist For restless years upon a bed-rid couch With the sole sense of dotage and distress, Than change with thee and take upon my soul Thy forfeiture and lodge within my breast That worm of memory which to-day shall breed. And which upon thy death-bed shall not die, But being of the soul shall be immortal. Go—God forgive thee! for not mine the heart That would invoke a curse. Aeswyn. Lady, I swear I bore a part not willingly in this; And could I without ruin of my fortunes Do aught that should redeem it— Adriana. For thy fortunes, Trust them to me. Enter one of the Attendants. Attendant. My Lord is at the gate And asks for you. [Exit. Adriana. I say, trust them to me. Do to thyself the justice to renounce This false Knight's service, and to me one act Of loyalty: seek out with instant haste The Lord of Arlon; tell him I am here In tribulation and beseech his aid, And bid him by the love he bears his lady To grant it me with speed. Wilt thou do this? Aeswyn. Madam, I will. Adriana. Go now then to thy Lord, Lest he suspect thy tarriance. I within Will wait the issue. Make all speed thou canst. Scene IV. —An Ante-chamber in the Earl's Palace. Sir Walter D'Arlon and Gilbert Matthew. Gilbert. No sooner had his Highness reach'd his door Than he sends back for me. D'Arlon. And me the same. Gilbert. His Highness is not happy. D'Arlon. That may be; But have you private cause to think it? Gilbert. Well, I've taken note that when he is not happy He sends for me. D'Arlon. And do you mend his mood? Gilbert. Nay, what I can. His Highness at such times Would fain be counsell'd to shed blood. D'Arlon. To that 'Tis said that he is counsell'd oft. Gilbert. Oh, ho! I tender my advice as duty bids With neither fear nor favour. As I came The bodies of three citizens lay stretch'd Upon the causeway. D'Arlon. How had they been kill'd? Gilbert. By knocking on the head. D'Arlon. Yes; and by whom? Gilbert. The officers that walk'd before the Earl To make him room to pass. The streets were full, And many of the mean-crafts roam'd about Discoursing of the news they heard from Ghent; And as his Highness pass'd they misbehaved And three were knock'd upon the head with staves. I knew by that his Highness was not happy; I knew I should be sent for. Enter an Usher from an inner chamber. Usher. Ho! Master Gilbert Matthew, pass within. [Re-enters the chamber, followed by Gilbert Matthew. D'Arlon. There's some men of their bloody counsels boast, As though it were heroic to be hard. Enter an Attendant. Attendant. My Lord, there's some one of the flight from Ghent Who seeks you. I inform'd him you were here In waiting on his Highness, but he still Insisted you would see him, did you know The matter and its urgency. D' Arlon. His name? Attendant. Van Aeswyn. D' Arlon. What! Sir Guy of Occo's Squire? Attendant. The same, my Lord. D'Arlon. Yes, yes, the man I know, But not the matter that he hath with me;— Unless it be some difference with my steward About his quarters. Bring me where he waits. Scene V. —A Chamber in the Earl's Palace. The Earl and Gilbert Matthew. Earl. And thus, if all that we have heard be true, Last night's ill news this morning somewhat mends. There's reason to surmise these granaries Were not destroy'd by chance, and that the hand Which did us this good service may do more. Meantime we'll pray the Bishop and the Duke To let no victuals pass their lands. Gilbert. In that You shall do well, my Lord. I know that folk; No poison works so wastingly amongst them As a low diet—yea, it brings them down. There'll be a hundred thousand mouths in Ghent Gaping like callow jackdaws. Ah! I know them; The men of battle are full feeders all; By the strong hand they live and help themselves With griping of the rest; when famine comes, 'Tis worse to those, seeing that theretofore They were too gross of body; worse to these, For they were pinched already. Earl. That is true. Gilbert. Yea, Sir, I know the White-Hoods. Wait awhile, And when they feel the vulture in their gut They shall be busy whetting of their beaks. Wait till they hunger, and not two in Ghent Shall be of one opinion. Earl. In God's time Distress shall breed dissensions as thou say'st. We'll trust to that, and therefore have great heed To block them out from access of provision. The country is well wasted thereabouts And what they get must travel far: ere long We'll cut them off from Brabant and from Liege. Enter the Lord of Arlon. D'Arlon. My Lord, I do beseech you make me quit Of Occo for my guest, and give us leave For instant combat. Earl. Walter, art thou mad? The Lord of Occo! What's thy breach with him? He is since yesterday, with thy good leave, Our very worthy friend. D'Arlon. My Lord, my Lord, He is since yesterday, if not before, The very lewdest villain that was e'er A blur and stain to knighthood. Earl. Say'st thou so? What are thy reasons? D'Arlon. With a violent hand And treacherous he carried off from Ghent The noblest of her ladies and the best, Whose honour he attempted yesternight Beneath my roof: and here on her behalf And on my own, your Highness I entreat That you give order to have lists prepared Where I may meet the miscreant spear to spear And do God's will upon him. Earl. Soft, my son; I'll have no fighting for a private cause Till Ghent be down. I cannot spare a spear; And this were but a childish cause at best For breaking one. The honest dames of Ghent Have scarce deserved protection at our hands; And when the time shall come, as come it will, That Ghent is storm'd and sack'd, they'll have no more Than their deserts: free quarters shall they give To lusty knight, hot squire, and man-at-arms. Shall they not, Gilbert? Gilbert. Sir, the dames of Ghent Must take what comes. Earl. Then Occo sinn'd not much To seize occasion by the forelock,—ha? Gilbert. My Lord, he did but what was just and right. D'Arlon. Peace, Master Gilbert Matthew—stand apart; I seek an audience direct and free, No craft of juggling renegade betwixt To interpose and toss me to and fro The words that please him or that please him not. My Lord, you know what service I have done, And with what voluntary heart, not bound By duty or allegiance to bear arms, For in my native land the while was peace. I scarce am call'd a man, and service yet I count by years, nor leave a winter out. I was the nursling of your camp, my Lord, And played with weapons ere my hands had strength To lift an iron basnet to my head; The war-horse neigh'd to see me when my legs His breadth of back bestrided scarce aslope, And rarely hath it been from that time forth That I have housed when men-at-arms took horse. This it befits not me to say, my Lord, Save for the just conclusion: I entreat That if it square not with your ways and will To grant the combat I am bound to claim, I then have leave to fold my banner up And quit your camp. Earl. Come, Walter, come, you're idle; When cause and opportunity are rife For reasonable fighting, we might well Dispense with all knight-errantry. Enough; See the moon out, and if thy humour hold It shall have way; the next that shines, I trust, Shall cast upon the battered walls of Ghent A thorough light. D'Arlon. Which if I live to see I'll claim the combat. Fare you well, my Lord. [Exit. Earl. Was ever man, with denizens for foes And foreigners for friends, so plagued as I! My bravest Knight would cast away his life To do me a disservice, with more zeal Than he was used to serve me with: denied, Straight he shall tell me he was born elsewhere And owes me no allegiance. Gilbert. By your leave, I could not wish your Highness better luck Than that the fools you count amongst your friends Were number'd with your foes,—or with the dead. Enter Attendant. Attendant. According to the summons, please your Grace, The Lords are met in Council. Earl. I shall come. Attend me, Gilbert, when the board breaks up, And thou shalt know the issue. Come to dine. And Sirrah, tell the butler that to-day I shall drink brandy. From all use of wine I'm interdicted by a sacred vow Till Ghent's submission free me. Be it soon! ACT IV. Scene I. —Ghent.—The platform at the top of the steeple of St. Nicholas' Church.—Time daybreak. Artevelde. There lies a sleeping city. God of dreams! What an unreal and fantastic world Is going on below! Within the sweep of yon encircling wall How many a large creation of the night, Wide wilderness and mountain, rock and sea, Peopled with busy transitory groups, Finds room to rise, and never feels the crowd! If when the shows had left the dreamers' eyes They should float upward visibly to mine, How thick with apparitions were that void! But now the blank and blind profundity Turns my brain giddy with a sick recoil. —I have not slept. I am to blame for that. Long vigils join'd with scant and meagre food Must needs impair that promptitude of mind And cheerfulness of spirit which, in him Who leads a multitude, is past all price. I think I could redeem an hour's repose Out of the night that I have squander'd, yet. The breezes on their early voyage launched Play with a pleasing freshness on my face. Lie there, my cloak, not seldom now my bed, And lying on thee I shall front them—so— [He lies down. If this were over—blessed be the calm That comes to me at last! A friend in need Is Nature to us, that when all is spent, Brings slumber—bountifully—whereupon We give her sleepy welcome—if all this Were honourably over—Adriana— [Falls asleep, but starts up almost instantly. I heard a hoof—I hear it now, I swear, Upon the road from Bruges,—or did I dream? No! 'tis the gallop of a horse at speed. Van den Bosch (without). What ho! Van Artevelde! Artevelde. Who calls? Van den Bosch. (entering) 'Tis I. Thou art an early riser like myself; Or is it that thou hast not been to bed? Artevelde. What are thy tidings? Van den Bosch. Nay, what can they be? A page from pestilence and famine's day-book; So many to the pest-house carried in, So many to the dead-house carried out. The same dull, dismal, damnable old story. Artevelde. Be quiet; listen to the westerly wind, And tell me if it bring thee nothing new. Van den Bosch. Nought to my ear, save howl of hungry dog That hears the house is stirring—nothing else. Artevelde. No,—now—I hear it not myself—no—nothing. The city's hum is up—but ere you came 'Twas audible enough. Van den Bosch. In God's name, what? Artevelde. A horseman's tramp upon the road from Bruges. Van den Bosch. Why then be certain 'tis a flag of truce! If once he reach the city we are lost. Nay, if he be but seen our danger's great. What terms so bad but they would gulp them now? Let's send some trusty varlets forth at once To cross his way. Artevelde. And send him back to Bruges? Van den Bosch. Send him to Hell—and that's a better place. Artevelde. Nay, softly, Van den Bosch; let war be war, But let us keep its ordinances. Van den Bosch. Tush! I say, but let them see him from afar And in an hour shall we, bound hand and foot, Be on our way to Bruges. Artevelde. Not so, not so. My rule of governance hath not been such As e'er to end so foully. Van den Bosch. Cockadoodle! Think'st thou a hundred thousand citizens Shall stay the fury of their empty maws Because thou'st ruled them justly? Artevelde. It may be That such a hope is mine. Van den Bosch. (going). Then thou art mad, And I must take this matter on myself. Artevelde. Hold, Van den Bosch! I say this shall not be. I must be madder than I think I am Ere I shall yield up my authority, Which I abuse not to be used by thee. Van den Bosch. This comes of lifting dreamers into power. I tell thee, in this strait and stress of dearth, The people, but to pave the way for peace, Would send our noddles in a bag to Bruges. Once and again I warn thee that thy life Hangs by a thread. Artevedle. Why, know I not it does? What hath it hung by else since Utas'eve? Did I not by mine own advised choice Place it in jeopardy for certain ends? And what think'st thou were these? To prop thy state? To float thee o'er a reef, and, that performed, See to our joint security? Indeed? No verily, not such my towering aim. I bent my thoughts on yonder city's weal; I look'd to give it victory and freedom; And working to that end, by consequence From one great peril did deliver thee— Not for the love of thee or of thy life, Which I regard not, but the city's service; And if for that same service it seem good, I will expose thy life to equal hazard. Van den Bosch. Thou wilt? Artevelde. I will. Van den Bosch. Oh, Lord! to hear him talk! What a most mighty emperor of puppets Is this that I have brought upon the board! But how if he that made it should unmake? Artevelde. Unto His sovereignty who truly made me With infinite humility I bow. Both, both of us are puppets, Van den Bosch; Part of the curious clock-work of this world We scold and squeak and crack each other's crowns, And if by twitches moved from wires not seen I were to toss thee from this steeple's top, I should be but the instrument, no more, The tool of that chastising Power above Which still exalts the lowly to abase The violent and proud. But let me hope There's no such task appointed me to-day. Thou passest in the world for worldly wise: Then, seeing each with each must sink or swim, What can it profit thee in this extreme Of our distress to wrangle with me thus For my supremacy and rule? Thy fate, As of necessity bound up with mine, Must needs partake my cares: let that suffice To put thy pride to rest till better days: Contest—more reasonably wrong—a prize More precious than the ordering of a wreck. Van den Bosch. Tush, tush! Van Artevelde, thou talk'st and talk'st, And honest burghers think it wondrous fine; But thou might'st easilier with that tongue of thine Persuade yon smoke to fly i' the face o' the wind Than talk away my wit and understanding. I say, yon herald shall not enter here. Artevelde. I know, Sir, no man better, where my talk Is serviceable singly, where it needs To be by acts enforced. I say, beware, And brave not mine authority too far. Van den Bosch. Hast thou authority to take my life? What is it else to let yon herald in To bargain for our blood? Artevelde. Thy life again! Why, what a very slave of life art thou! Look round about on this once populous town; Not one of these innumerous house-tops But hides some spectral form of want and woe, Some peevish pining child and moaning mother, Some aged man that in his do tage scolds Not knowing why he hungers, some cold corse That lies unstraightened where the spirit left it. Look round and answer what thy life can be To tell for more than dust upon the scales. I too would live—I have a love for life— But rather than to live to charge my soul With one hour's lengthening out of ills like these, I'd leap this parapet with as free a bound As e'er was schoolboy's o'er a garden wall. Van den Bosch. I'd like to see thee do it. Artevelde. I know thou would'st; But for the present be content to see My less precipitate descent; for lo! [Exit. There comes the herald o'er the hill. Van den Bosch. Beshrew thee! Thou shalt not have the start of me in this. Scene II. —The House Van Artevelde. Ursel, Van Ryk, and Van Muck. Ursel. He will be here for his breakfast anon. Van Ryk. And call you this his breakfast? Ursel. An ounce of horseflesh and half an oaten cake. It is his only meal; and if I were to make it larger he would ne'er look at it. Van Muck. Why we ourselves fare better. Van Ryk. I fare somewhat better, and for thee, thou wouldst make a famine where there was none. No more than this morsel of meat in four-and-twenty hours. Ursel. No more; and if he has been abroad 'tis more than likely that he shall bring home some little child or some sick woman to share it with him. Van Ryk. It is wonderful how stout he is withal. Some men shall but bite their nails and their belly 's full. Van Muck. There is a difference in men; I might eat the four hoofs of an ox and my stomach should droop you look you and flap you look you, like an empty sail. Enter Artevelde. Artevelde. A herald, Sirs, is coming here from Bruges. To horse, Van Muck, to horse with Swink and Kloos And any other of thy readiest men, And bring him safely in. What ails thee, man? Van Muck. Sir, saving your displeasure, Swink and Kloos, Against your express orders and despite Of much I said myself, have ate their horses. Artevelde. Thou say'st not so? God's vengeance on their maws! Next horse they kill, my cook shall serve it up, And melt the shoes for sauce. Why, then, to horse With any that are mounted; and beware! Some there may be of evil-minded men Who would do outrage to the city's honour And harm the herald. Look thou keep him safe. Van Muck. Sir, safe he shall be, let who will gainsay. [Exit. Clara enters, but remains behind. Artevelde. And now, Van Ryk, I have a charge for thee. Thou in the porch of Old St. Nicholas' Church Art to mount guard beside the postern-gate Which leads upon the stair that climbs the tower. Betake thee thither, and until I come, Inward or outward let none pass. What cheer? [Turning to Clara.] Come hither, Clara. Clara. Philip, not too close. Artevelde. What, com'st thou from the hospital? Clara. Straight thence, Breathing infection with my every breath. God help me for a pestilent little fool! I tend the sick from weary day to day, Though Heaven has set its face against a cure, And they that should have thank'd me for my pains Will never more speak word. Artevelde. Thou heed'st not that; No, I am certain 'tis for no man's thanks That thou hast toil'd; and let them live or die, Thou hast thine own reward. Much hath thy soul Enriched her chambers with the spoils of war Since life became a warfare, not a sport. In easier hours it may be I had cause, This time or that, to wish thy boldness less, Though trusting still that time, which tempers all, Would bring thee soberer thoughts and tame thy heart. What time to tardy consummation brings, Calamity, like to a frosty night That ripeneth the grain, completes at once. But now that we're alone,—not gone, Van Ryk? Van Ryk. Sir, to speak freely, had it been your will To put me to a service of more action I had not shamed the choice; for though I'm old,— Artevelde. Tut, tut, Van Ryk! 'twill come—the time will come, And action to thy heart's content thou'lt have. This service is of special trust. Begone! [Exit Van Ryk. Now render me account of what befell Where thou hast been to-day. Clara. Not much is that. I paid a visit first to Ukenheim, The man who whilome saved our father's life When certain Clementists and ribald folk Assail'd him at Malines. He came last night, And said he knew not if we owed him aught, But if we did, a peck of oatmeal now Would pay the debt and save more lives than one. I went. It seem'd a wealthy man's abode; The costly drapery and good house-gear Had, in an ordinary time, made known 'That with the occupant the world went well. By a low couch, curtain'd with cloth of frieze, Sat Ukenheim, a famine-stricken man, With either bony fist upon his knees And his long back upright. His eyes were fix'd And moved not, though some gentle words I spake: Until a little urchin of a child That call'd him father, crept to where he sat And pluck'd him by the sleeve, and with its small And skinny finger pointed: then he rose And with a low obeisance, and a smile That look'd like watery moonlight on his face, So pale and weak a smile, he bade me welcome. I told him that a lading of wheat-flour Was on its way, whereat, to my surprise, His countenance fell and he had almost wept. Artevelde. Poor soul! and wherefore? Clara. That I saw too soon. He pluck'd aside the curtain of the couch, And there two children's bodies lay composed. They seem'd like twins of some ten years of age, And they had died so nearly both at once He scarce could say which first: and being dead, He put them, for some fanciful affection, Each with its arm about the other's neck, So that a fairer sight I had not seen Than those two children with their little faces So thin and wan, so calm and sad and sweet. I look'd upon them long, and for a while I wished myself their sister, and to lie With them in death as with each other they; I thought that there was nothing in the world I could have loved so much; and then I wept; And when he saw I wept, his own tears fell, And he was sorely shaken and convulsed Through weakness of his frame and his great grief. Artevelde. Much pity was it he so long deferred To come to us for aid. Clara. It was indeed; But whatsoe'er had been his former pride, He seem'd a humbled and heart-broken man. He thank'd me much for what I said was sent, But I knew well his thanks were for my tears. He look'd again upon the children's couch, And said, low down, they wanted nothing now. So, to turn off his eyes and change his mood, I drew the small survivor of the three Before him, and he snatch'd it up, and soon Seem'd lost and quite forgetful; and with that I stole away. Artevelde. There is a man by fate Fitted for any enterprise. Alas! Alas! Of many such I have the choice. And next, The hospital? Clara. I paid my visit there With Father John. But here he comes himself. Enter Father John of Heda. Artevelde. What cheer, good Father? Father John. Heavy is my cheer; What else but heavy, when from day to day I see still more of suffering sinking men Pass to the choked churchyard? Artevelde. Truly, the sight Must needs bring on a heaviness of cheer. How came I not to think of that before! Who waits? Too many things conspire—who waits? Enter Steward. Repair thee to the captains of the guards, And give my orders that from this time forth No funerals be allow'd till after dark. [Exit Steward. And so the sickness spreads? Father John. It spreads apace. Since Egypt's plagues did never rage disease So sore and so invincible by art, So varied in its forms, and in its signs So unintelligibly strange: in some The fever keeps its course from first to last; In others intermits: here suddenly The patient's head is seized with racking pains; Then shift they to his chest with change as quick, Then to his loins, and strangury succeeds, With clammy sweat, hard breathing and hot thirst. The intervals of pain, if such there be, Afford him no repose, but he is still Dejected, restless, of a hopeless mind, Indifferent to all incidents and objects, Or in his understanding too confused To see or apprehend them: first the face Is red and flush'd, with large and fiery eyes; Then is it dropsical and deadly pale: Sometimes such shudderings seize upon the frame That the bed shakes beneath it, and with that The breath is check'd with sobbings as from cold; Then comes a thick dark crust upon the lips And tongue and teeth; the fatal hiccough next. Some die in struggles and strong agonies; Some in a lethargy; whilst others wake As from a dream, shake off the fit, look round, And with collected senses and calm speech Tell the by-standers that their hour is come. Artevelde. It is a dismal malady, and this, Like all our thousand miseries beside, Demands a remedy that kills or cures. What wild beasts' yells are these? [Tumult and shouting without. The Page enters. Henry, what news? Page. The man from Bruges, escorted by Van Muck, Is coming here, with crowds of people, wild To hear what message he may bring. Van Muck Forbids that any words should pass his lips Till he have speech of you. Artevelde. Van Muck is right. Page. But oh! you never saw such wrathful men! They'll tear them both to pieces. Artevelde. Have no fear; Van Muck will make his way. Ay, here they come. Enter Van Muck and Van Aeswyn. What! this the messenger? Death of my soul! Either mine eyes are treacherous as himself Or else I see a follower of that false Dishonour'd knight and perjured knave Van Occo. How is it, if he dares to send thee here, That thou hast dared to come? Aeswyn. So please you, Sir, The Lord of Occo— Artevelde. Grant me but a day After the siege—Furies and Fates!—one day,— One day to hunt that reptile to his hole And stamp my heel upon his recreant neck! What dost thou here? Aeswyn. I come not here from him, For since he made his war upon a maid, I have renounced his service; more than that, I to the Lord of Arlon did that errand Which wrought to her deliverance. Artevelde. Aha! I crave thy pardon. I had heard 'twas thou, Though it escaped me. Tell thy tale; but first, What tidings of that lady? Aeswyn. She remains, By her own will, Sir, in the knightly hands Of my good Lord of Arlon. Artevelde. Say no more: Elsewhere I would not wish her. [The tumult increases without and Artevelde's name is called repeatedly. Let me now Dismiss this noisy and impatient herd That throng my doors, and then—ho! hark you, Steward, Conduct Van Aeswyn to my cabinet. [Exeunt all but Artevelde and Clara. My Clara, we have here a bustling day; Perhaps I shall not see thee, love, again Till after night-fall; but I will not lose Thy good-night kiss, so give it to me now. Clara. Philip, there's something in your thoughts—but no— I will not tease you—there—good-night—Adieu! [Exit Clara. More clamour without. Artevelde passes into an external gallery which overlooks the street and is heard addressing the people. Artevelde. Hence to the Stadt-house, friends! I'll meet you there, And either bring the messenger himself Or tell you of his tidings: hence—begone! [The people disperse. Van Occo, thou art in thine own despite The mainstay of my hope. I have within Assurance strong as destiny, that I, And I alone, a mission have from Heaven To execute God's justice upon thee. 'Tis strange! there's here a city to be saved, And there (what none but I take thought upon) A maid to be recovered and revenged, And which in this tough heart is uppermost I would not that my subject-citizens knew. Scene III. —Before the Stadt-House, as in the last Scene of the Second Act. —The people assemble. Frans Ackerman and Peter Van Nuitre in front. Ackerman. 'Tis certain something has befallen him. Van Nuitre. But where? He might be found, if so it were. Ackerman. Hast sought him at Jozyne's estaminet? Van Nuitre. There and at every lodgment in the town. Old mother Van den Bosch will take her oath He went forth early to Van Artevelde's. Ackerman. Sure nothing can have happen'd to him there. Van Nuitre. That's what I doubt. The best will sometimes trip. They were not in such unison of mind As we could wish. Ackerman. I cannot think it—No— But this day's business shall no farther fare Until the truth appear. Soft! now he comes. Artevelde enters. There is dead silence. He walks slowly up the steps of the platform. Artevelde. Are we all here? One from the Crowd. What's left of us is here, Our bones. Artevelde. We're wasted in the flesh, 'tis true; But we have spirits left. We all are here. Ackerman. I will say nay to that. Where's Van den Bosch? Artevelde. Silence, Frans Ackerman! we want not him. Ackerman. Then I demand if he be dead or living? Artevelde. He lives. Ackerman. Where is he, then? Artevelde. Where all shall be Who seek, by mutiny against their Chief, To do unlawful deeds. What ask ye more? He is arrested and confined. Ackerman. What cause For this proceeding hath that brave man given? Artevelde. If, as his friend, thou ask wherein he err'd, I'll tell it to this people and to thee,— Not, mark you me, as rendering account, For that were needless,—but of free good-will. Sirs, Van den Bosch insisted, in despite Of all dissuasion, all authority, The messenger from Bruges should be waylaid And put to death—yea, nothing less would serve,— That so the tidings which I'm here to tell Might never reach your ears. To place restraint Upon this obstinate humour and give scope To your deliberations, for a while He is in duress. Are ye well content? Many Voices. Content, content! The tidings, what are They? Artevelde. Frans Ackerman, thou hear'st what cause constrain'd Me, much reluctant, thus to use thy friend. Art thou content? Ackerman. I am. Artevelde. So far is well; And we set forth unanimous, to end I trust no otherwise. Fair Sirs of Ghent! Van Aeswyn, the Ambassador from Bruges, Comes with credentials from the Earl, to show What mind he bears toward you. Bitterer words Did never Christian man to Christians send. But we are fallen, my friends, and vain it were For us to quarrel with the proud man's scorn. Then to the matter take ye heed alone And trouble not your hearts for aught beside. He will admit you to no terms but these,— That every man and woman born in Ghent Shall meet him on the road, half way to Bruges, Bare-footed and bare-headed, in their shirts, With halters on their necks, and there kneel down And put their lives and chattels at his feet. This if ye do not now, he's sworn an oath That he will never hearken to you more, But famine shall consume you utterly, And in your desolate town he'll light a flame That shall not be extinguish'd. Speak your minds. Will ye accept the proffer'd terms or no? Burghers. Give us your counsel. Tell us what is best. Artevelde. What can I say? Ye know that as ye are Ye cannot live. Death opens every door And sits in every chamber by himself. If what might feed a sparrow should suffice For soldiers' meals, ye have not wherewithal To linger out three days. For corn, there's none; A mouse imprison'd in your granaries Were starved to death. And what then should I say? Why truly this: that whatsoe'er men's plight, There is a better choosing and a worse, If their discretion be not overthrown By force of their calamities. Three things Ye have to choose of. Ye may take his terms And go with halters round your necks to Loo. Ye will be then his servants and his wealth, The labourers of his vineyard; and I deem, Although a haughty Lord he be and cruel, That he will have the sense to spare his own When vengeance hath been fed. I say I deem That when the blood of those that led you on And of their foremost followers hath flow'd, He will be satiate and stay his hand. If this to try be your deliberate choice, I will not say that ye be ill-advised. How are ye minded? Let your Deacons speak. [The people speak in consultation with each other and with the Deacons. Deacon of the Mariners. We of the mariners deem that this were best. Deacon of the Cordwainers. There's nothing better can be done. Deacon of the Fullers. Agreed. Our craft was never forward in the war. Deacon of the Weavers. But, Master Philip, said you not three ways There were to choose of? Tell us what remains. Artevelde. Ye may have patience and expect the close If nothing else seem fit, betake yourselves Unto your churches; at the altar's foot Kneel down and pray and make a Christian end, And God will then have mercy on your souls. This is the second way. Deacon of the Weavers. And what the third? Artevelde. If there be found amongst you men whose blood Runs not so chilly yet as thus to die, Then there's this third way open—but not else:— That they whose plight is best and hearts are stout Be muster'd suddenly, equipp'd and arm'd; That with our little left of food and wine The sumpter beasts be laden for their use; That then they follow me: to-morrow's eve Should find us knocking at the gates of Bruges, And then we'd strike a stroke for life or death. This is the third and sole remaining course. Choose of the three. Many voices. Choose for us, Master Philip: You are more wise than we. Artevelde. If by my choice Ye will abide, a soldier's death for me. Many voices. To Bruges! to Bruges! a venture forth to Bruges! Artevelde. Why yet, then, in our embers there is life. Let whosoe'er would follow me, repair To the West Port. From them that come I'll choose Five thousand, if so many there should be, And when night falls, we'll sally from the gates. Many citizens again. For Bruges! for Bruges! 'tis gallantly resolved. Artevelde. Then fare ye well, ye citizens of Ghent! This is the last time ye will see me here Unless God prosper me past human hope. I thank you for the dutiful demeanour Which never—never—verily no, not once, Have I found wanting, though severely tried When discipline might seem without reward. Fortune has not been kind to me, good friends; But let not that deprive me of your loves, Or of your good report. Be this the word: “His rule was brief, calamitous—but just.” No glory which a prosperous fortune gilds, If shorn of this addition, could suffice To lift my heart so high as it is now. This is that joy in which my soul is strong, That there is not a man amongst you all Who can reproach me that I used my power To do him an injustice. If there be, It is not to my knowledge; yet I pray That he will now forgive me, taking note That I had not to deal with easy times. First citizen. Oh, Master Philip, there is none-not one. Second citizen. Most justly and most wisely you have ruled. Artevelde. I thank you, Sirs; farewell to you once more; Once more, farewell. If I return to Ghent A glory and dominion will be yours Such as no city since the olden time Hath been so bold to conquer or to claim. If I return no more, God's will be done! To Him and to His providence I leave you. [He descends. The people come round him, seizing his hands and crying confusedly, “God bless you, Master Philip! God be with you!” Nay, press not on me, friends; I see ye weep, Which ye did never for your past mishaps. But ye shall be disburthen'd of your griefs The rather than dishearten'd by these tears, Or else should I reprove them—so—farewell! Scene IV. —The Vestibule of the Church of St. Nicholas. —At the further end of it Van Ryk is seen keeping guard over the door which gives access to the church tower.—In front, Clara appears, followed at a little distance by Van Aeswyn. Clara. Still he pursues me; but this must not be. How now, good Sir? whom seek you? Aeswyn. With your leave, I have an errand for your private ear. Clara. My private ear! I have no private ear. My ears will not be private. Aeswyn. I beseech you To pardon my presumption. Clara. Well, what then? It is not past forgiveness; no, no, no; I freely pardon you. Aeswyn. I thank you, madam; And were I but permitted to speak out All that he bade me say— Clara. That he!—what he? Aeswyn. The Lord of Arlon, madam. Clara. Lord of what? Aeswyn. Sir Walter, Lord of Arlon. Clara. Oh! Sir Walter,— Sir Walter D'Arlon—a good Knight, they say: He sent his service, did he?—a good Knight. I knew him once—he came to Ghent—O God! I'm sick—the air is hot, I think—yes, hot! I pray you pardon me—we get no rest In this beleaguer'd town—no anything— This is the time of day I use to faint; But I shall miss to do it for this once; So please you to proceed. Aeswyn. There's here a bench; If you'll be seated: for you look so pale. . . . Clara. No, I can stand—I think—Well then, I'll sit. So now, your errand? Aeswyn. The Lord of Arlon, madam, Imparted to me that of all the griefs That Fortune had dealt out to him, was none So broke his spirit as the cruel thought That you in some sort must partake the woes Of this so suffering city: he could ne'er Lay lance in rest or do a feat of arms But thoughts arose that stung him to the heart, And each success that should have brought him joy Was turn'd to bitterness, seeming nought else But injury to his love. Thus is he now A man whose heart resents his handiwork, And all his pleasure in the war is poison'd. Clara. Poor D'Arlon! but I cannot help him. Aeswyn. Well, Himself thinks otherwise; he bade me say That he implores you to fly hence to him. Clara. No; never, never! Aeswyn. And his aunt at Bruges, The Prioress, will have you in her care Till it shall please you to permit his suit. Clara. I tell thee, never! I a fugitive! No; Whilst Philip lives and holds the city out, Nor pestilence nor famine, fire nor sword, Shall part us, though an Angel called me hence. Much may he lose, and much that's far more worth, But never this reliance. Aeswyn. With your leave, I would make bold to ask you if your flight In these extremities might not rejoice Rather than grieve him? Clara. No, Sir, you mistake, Knowing nor him nor me: we two have grown From birth on my side, boyhood upon his, Inseparably together, as two grafts Out of the self-same stock; we've shared alike The sun and shower and all that Heaven has sent; I've loved him much and quarrell'd with him oft, And all our loves and quarrels past are links No adverse Fates can sever. We are one. And I am useful, too; he'll tell you that; We Arteveldes were made for times like these; The Deacon of the Mariners said well That we are of such canvas as they use To make storm-stay-sails. I have much in charge, And here I stay. Aeswyn. Then must I say you never— Clara. Alas, poor D'Arlon! said I never? No; That is a sharp, unkindly-sounding word. Tell him to ask me when the siege is raised. But then he shall not need: he can come hither; But tell him—of your knowledge—not from me— The woman could not be of Nature's making Whom, being kind, her misery made not kinder. Aeswyn. The thought of that may solace him. Farewell. Clara. Farewell. I mount the tower to look abroad. After your conference at noon, they say, My brother arm'd himself and bade his horse Be ready harness'd in his mail complete; And though you keep his secret, I surmise That were I mounted on the church-tower top, There's something I might see. Aeswyn. To come from Bruges? No, nothing, Lady, thence. Clara. But yet I'll look. [She approaches the door of the Tower and meets Van Ryk, who plants himself before her. Van Ryk. You cannot pass, my Lady. Clara. How! not pass? Van Ryk. The door is lock'd; your brother keeps the key. My orders are of rigour, come what may, To suffer none to pass. Clara. How could they pass, If what thou say'st be true? Thou hast the key. Van Ryk. Upon my faith I have it not. Clara. So, so! A courteous usage for a lady this! But hither comes my prince of spies, the Page, To tell what's doing. Enter Page. Page. Here's a feat indeed! A glorious enterprise afoot! Clara. Nay; what? What is it? tell us true. Page. Illustrious Lady! The name of Artevelde shall live for ever! For Master Philip leads five thousand men This very night to storm the gates of Bruges. Clara. Thou dost not say it? Page. True as written book. Clara. There's that then shall make Flanders hold her breath, There's that shall startle Ghent with fearful hope, And though 'tis shame in such an hour as this To think of aught so idle, yet 'tis true There's liberty for me: if Philip goes, What bondage bids me stay? Aeswyn. Most surely none; And therefore hence to Bruges whilst yet time serves. Clara. Nay, nay, Sir, not so fast; gain Philip first, And then come back to me and take your chance. [Exeunt Clara, Van Aeswyn, and Page. Enter Artevelde,who advances to the door of the Tower where Van Ryk is stationed. Artevelde. How fares our friend within? set ope the door. Van Ryk. Oh, Sir! you must not enter; he is mad. I would not give a denier for the life Of any that should enter now; he's arm'd, And storms and rages like a man possess'd. Artevelde. Whence tak'st thou that conclusion? Van Ryk. For three hours He strove and shouted as though fifty fiends Did battle on the narrow stair; and once He flung his body with such desperate force Against the door, that I was much in doubt Whether the triple bars could hold their own. Then—God be merciful! the oaths and curses! Faster they came than I could tell my beads. Artevelde. But all is silent now. Van Ryk. The last half-hour I have not heard him. Artevelde. Open me the door. Van Ryk. Surely you will not enter? Artevelde. Nay, I must. We must be friends again. I want his aid. Van Ryk. He will assault you ere a word be said. Artevelde. He is a hasty man; but we must meet. Van. Ryk. Then I will enter with you. Artevelde. No, Van Ryk; I seek his confidence; a show of force Were sure to baffle me. I go alone. Van Ryk. For mercy's sake, forbear. Should you go in, Or you or he will ne'er come out alive. Artevelde. Nay, nay, thou know'st not with what winning ways I can sleek down his wrath. Stand fast below, I charge thee, and let no intrusive step Trouble my conference with Van den Bosch. [Exit. Van Ryk. It shall not trouble him to creep up behind And hearken on the stair. No sin in that. Scene V. —The Platform at the top of the Steeple—as in the First Scene in this Act. Artevelde and Van den Bosch. Artevelde. He has been drunk with anger and he sleeps. Lest he be not the soberer for his doze 'Twere well to strip him of his weapons. Come, Come, courtier, from thy house—come from thy case, Thou smooth and shining dangler by the side Of them that put thee to a deadly use: Thou art dismiss'd. [He lays aside the dagger. And come thou likewise forth, Thou flashing flourisher in the battle-field; Gaudy and senseless tool of sovereignty, Up to thy shoulders thou shalt reek in blood, And 'tis but wiping thee to make thee clean, So poor a thing art thou!—there—get thee gone— [He lays aside the sword. Now that he's stingless I may stir him up. Ho! Van den Bosch! arouse thee. What, thou sleep'st! Why here's a sluggard! Up! thou lubberly sot! Get thee afoot; is this a time to sleep? Up, ere I prod thee with my sword—up, slug! Up, drowsy clod—why, now I think thou wak'st. Van den Bosch. What noisy villain's this?—Van Artevelde! Artevelde. Nay, never grope and fumble for thy weapons; They are conveyed away. Van den Bosch. Oh! villain! slave! And wilt thou murder me unarm'd? Artevelde. Out! out! More like to whip thee for thy fond conceit. I tell thee, man, a better friend than I Thou'st not been bless'd with for this many a year; When all is known to thee, thyself shalt say That a more friendly deed was never done That this of mine—the shutting of thee up. Van den Bosch. Philip Van Artevelde, I say thou liest— Give me my sword again. I say thou liest— Give me my dagger and my sword—thou liest— Thou art a caitiff and a lying knave And thou hast stolen my dagger and my sword. Artevelde. Nay, softly, friend. Van den Bosch. I'm plunder'd, plunder'd, robb'd— I'm plunder'd of my weapons—of my sword. Give me my sword again, thou liar thou! I'm plunder'd of my dagger and my sword. My sword, thou robber, or I'll kill thee. Artevelde. Nay, Do that and thou no longer needst thy sword. Van den Bosch. Thou coward, wilt thou give me back my sword? Artevelde. There—take it, and the Devil give thee good on't! Now that thou hast it, mayhap thou'lt be brought To leave thy bellowing and listen. Hark! Van den Bosch. I have thee now, Van Artevelde, I have thee. Ha, ha! I have my sword—I have thee now! Artevelde. And if thou had'st thy senses and thine ears It were a better having for thy weal. Wilt thou be still and listen to me? Van den Bosch. No. Thou art a liar. Draw thy sword and fight. Artevelde. I give thee back thy lie and take thy challenge; To mortal proof we'll put it, if thou wilt, But not by instant combat. Three days hence I pledge my word to answer thy demand, And I will show thee reasons why not now. Van den Bosch. To the pit of Hell with reasons! draw thy sword. Artevelde. (draws his sword and flings it from him).— I'll fight thee when I please and not before. Van den Bosch. Art thou a coward? wherefore wilt not fight? Artevelde. There is a time for all things. Here I stand Unarm'd before thee, and I will be heard. That which so much thou tak'st to heart, was done Purely to save thy credit, much indeed Endanger'd by thy wilfulness and haste. I would have done myself no less offence To do thee so much service. Say thine arm Had cut me off the messenger from Bruges; Ghent hears the rumour—magnifies at once The untold terms to unconditional peace, And mad with rage for comfort thus repell'd Had turn'd upon thee to thine overthrow. But list to what instead I've brought to pass: The terms were told,—such sanguinary terms As we had cause to look for; on that ground I moved the people to a last attempt Of desperate daring, and we go to-night, Five thousand men, to seek the Earl at Bruges. Now, Peter Van den Bosch, give ear to me: Thy mouth has been this many a day stuff'd full Of vengeance dire denounced against this Earl. The blood of Heins, of Launoy and Van Ranst, (True friends of thine if truth and friendship be!) Sinks in the ground, nor honour'd nor avenged Save by the mouthing of an idle threat. Dead men and living, vows after vows sent up In hot succession to the throne of Heaven, Deep ravage done amongst thy native fields, Strange tortures suffer'd by thy countrymen, Call thee with common voice to turn thy wrath To just account;—and is it come to this, That for the matter of but one day's feud With one tried friend that never did thee hurt, Thou canst forget all else and put thy cause To imminent hazard at the utmost verge Of all its fortunes and its ultimate hope! If so, I cry thee mercy; I mistook; For I had counted on thine aid to-day To do the thing that thou so oft hast threaten'd. Van den Bosch. Van Artevelde, I never yet forgave So deep an injury as thou hast done me; But seeing how things bear, I'll pass it by Until this last adventure have an end. Then shalt thou reckon with me for the past. Artevelde. For that I stand prepared. Meanwhile I pray, Let needful concord join us in one yoke, Nor let the common welfare feel this feud. Take thou thy charge in this day's work; come down And I will give it thee. From me thou'lt find All fit observance. Van den Bosch. I will take my charge. ACT V. Scene I. —The field of Merle, in the environs of Bruges. Artevelde, Van den Bosch, Van Ryk, Van Muck, and others. Artevelde. Not a step farther; give the word to halt, And bring the waggons up; we can't be better. God grant that they come hither in their haste! Here is the fighting-ground, and there the slough In which they needs must perish should they yield. We can't be better. Van den Bosch. Let it then be here. I've probed the slough. Artevelde. That I did too; 'tis deep. Van den Bosch. He is a taller man than you or I That finds the bottom with his head above. Artevelde. It is an hour to sunset. Van Ryk. Nay, 'tis more. Artevelde. A little more, Van Ryk. I would to God The sun might not go down upon us here Without a battle fought! Van den Bosch. If so it should We pass a perilous night. Artevelde. A nipping night, And wake a wasted few the morrow morn. Van Muck. We have a supper left. Artevelde. My Lady's page If he got ne'er a better should be wroth And burn in effigy my Lady's steward. For us and for one supper 'twill suffice; But he's a skilful man at splitting hairs That can make two on't. Van Ryk. Ay, or leave behind A breakfast in his dish. Artevelde. We break our fast Elsewhere to-morrow. I pray God the Saint Whose feast they celebrate to-night at Bruges May steep them well in wine. If Ukenheim Get undiscover'd in, we shall not miss To profit by his skill. Van den Bosch. We'll hope the best; But if there be a knave in power unhang'd, And in his head a grain of sense undrown'd, He'll be their caution not to— Artevelde. Van den Bosch, Talk we of battle and survey the field, For I will fight. Let stakes be driven in Amongst the rushes at the nether end Of this morass. Van Ryk, look thou to that. And thou, Van Muck, unload the victual here; Then tilt the waggons up behind the stakes And pierce them for cross-bows. A horse for me, That I may know the ground. And now, friends all, Let's to our charges. Ere the red sun sink Beyond yon city, Ghent is lost or saved! Scene II. —An open Tent erected for public entertainment in the Market-place of Bruges.—Boisterous songs and other sounds of riot and jollity are heard on all sides. Within the tent a miscellaneous company are drinking, and amongst them is Ukenheim in the dress of a Mariner of Bruges. Ukenheim. I pray you pledge me in this, to our better acquaintance. Lunyz. At your service, Sir. What say'st thou, Jan Trickle? Is not this the right way? Is not this the narrow road? Knew'st thou ever a Saint's day more seemly celebrated? Dost see what a devotion there is to it? Trickle. I see very many righteous gentlemen very drunk. But my wife says, were they at church it should be more seemly. Kroolkhuys. Bah! didst ever know a man's wife that liked him to be drinking without her to help? Gulpus. Mine is a rare helpmate. Lunyz. Let the Church speak. Father Swillen, is not this as it should be? Father Swillen. My son, and worthy burgesses, and beloved brethren! Of the present solemnity I will deliver my opinion according to the canons. Wine is to be used cum abstinentiâ et temperantiâ, for the recovery of the sick, the consolation of the dying, and the healing of a wounded spirit. It is also to be used in honour of our Lady of Bolayne on this the day of her festival. But the presence of a priest is needful herein, for the preventing of abuses and the showing of a proper example. [Drinks. Tackenham (advancing from the farther end of the tent.) Father Swillen—friend, if I knocked you down I ask your pardon—Father Swillen—Sirs, give me place, for I must see the Father—Father Swillen, I look upon you to be one man of a thousand—I will go on my knees to you—I look upon you to be the oracle of God—I look upon you to be the invisible oracle of God—for there you are and I see you not.—I can stand,—I say I can stand—but here I kneel down, and I will not rise unless you stretch forth your hand to me and raise me up— and this is the view I take of our duties as Christian men —all which is submitted to your better judgment, and I would that all men paid their dues to the Church. Father Swillen. God requite you, my son! For their salvation—for their salvation—nothing else. Lunyz (looking out into the Market-place). Here is a minstrel twiddles with the strings of his cithern. Now we shall hear a song. THE FOLLOWING SONG IS SUNG TO A VULGAR TUNE. Who mounts the merry-go-round with me, Who mounts the merry-go-round? 'Tis I, I, I,—and who be ye That would mount the merry-go-round? A blacksmith I,—spearheads as good As e'er from Bordeaux came I've made, and would in Ghentsmen's blood Be bold to dip the same. Who mounts the merry-go-round with me, Who mounts the merry-go-round? 'Tis I, I, I,—and who may'st be That would mount the merry-go-round? A cutler I,—as true a blade As ever Ebro steel'd Is this I've made, nor will't be stayed By any Ghentsman's shield. Who mounts the merry-go-round with me, Who mounts the merry-go-round? 'Tis I, I, I,—and now let us see Who mounts the merry-go-round. A barber I,—and well appear'd My handicraft, for when A Ghentsman's beard I shortly shear'd It never grew again. Who mounts the merry-go-round with me, Who mounts the merry-go-round? 'Tis I, I, I,—and a priest was he That would mount the merry-go-round. A Ghentsman of his wounds lay sick, And shall I be saved? he cried; I gave him a kick, bade him ask Old Nick And he should be satisfied. Kroolkhuys. I' faith he sings like a nightingale. No more, thank you,—I cannot—cannot . . . well, if I must . . . [drinks.] 'Tis a charming lullaby, and the sentiment very tender and soothing. Let us all do as we would be done by, God bless us! [Falls asleep. [Suddenly is heard from the Market-place a loud cry of “To arms! To arms!” Ukenheim (starting up and drawing his sword.) To arms? What! the men of Ghent come to us? What! the scarecrows from Ghent! To arms! to arms! Out and down with them! To arms! to arms! Kroolkhuys (waking). Why how is this? the men of Ghent! What ho! give me my coat of proof! Ukenheim. Let cowards stay behind. To arms! to arms! [They rush out confusedly. Tackenham creeps from under the table where he had remained in a reclining posture. Takenham. To arms! I look upon Father Swillen to be an oracle, and it were to be wished that all men paid the Church her dues. Scene III. —The Palace. The Lord of Occo and Gilbert Matthew. Gilbert. His Highness will be here anon. Sir Guy, Freely accept the combat for the morrow. Count on my speed. There's not a man in Bruges Who has outlived the day I wish'd him dead. The threads of many destinies I hold Unknown to them they bind for life or death, And I am punctual as the planet stars. A winter's night, as long as nights are now, Is worth an age. Occo. One doubt detains me still. The Earl, if ever it were known, would— Gilbert. Hark! 'Tis over, that. He loves him now no more. For every philtre that can make men love I know the secret of an antidote. I've warn'd him of those private ties in Ghent. Enough. I've dosed him. Occo. Well, it shall be done. Gilbert. I will provide the hands. Occo. You shall not need. I have already sent for two tried men,— Italians; they are practised hands and fit. Gilbert. I have you then; 'tis Erclo and Romero. Occo. The same. Enter the Earl. Earl. What shouting's this I hear abroad? Occo. The revellers, my good Lord; they pitch the bar, And shoot with cross-bows for a prize. My Lord, At noon to-morrow, if his heart but hold, I'll meet Sir Walter D'Arlon. Gilbert. In good truth But are these shouts of revel? Hark, again! They cry “To arms!” Earl. By Heaven! I think 'tis that! And hear ye not the bells? They're ringing backwards. Occo. 'Tis an alarm. Enter the Lord of Arlon, Sir Robert Mareschault, and others. Earl. Well, D'Arlon, what is this? D'Arlon. The men of Ghent, my Lord, the men of Ghent. Earl. What, here? D'Arlon. Two miles aloof they make a stand. Earl. What, are they mad? D'Arlon. I think not mad, my Lord, But desperate. Earl. My friends, 'tis all as one. Now shall this war be gloriously closed, And famine, that was tedious, be o'erta'en. Bring out my banner, summon all to arms, Then forth and fight them. Gilbert. Please you, Sir, to say How many they may number. Sir Robert. At a guess, About five thousand. Gilbert. May they move or stand? Sir Robert. Since they were first descried they have not stirr'd. Earl. Forth with my banner; out with horse and foot. Sir Knights, we muster in the Market-place. Bring me my armour, ho! Gilbert. My Lord, one word, Ere yet the Knights depart. These men are few, But they are desperate; famine-bitten are they, But alway are the leanest wolves most brave To break the fold. Sir, let us not be rash; Our men at-arms are somewhat flush'd with drink And may be ill to guide. Sir, think upon it. Fight them to-morrow. Let them sleep to-night In winter's lap, beneath the ragged tent Of a December's sky. When morning breaks You'll see them lying upon yon hill-side As dead and sapless as the last month's leaves. Give them this night. The Hase of Flanders. They'll think we stay through fear. Gilbert. Think they their will; whate'er they think of that They shall unthink to-morrow. Earl. By my faith, I know not, Gilbert, but thou mayst be right. The winter's night is sure to thin their ranks Of fighting men; and if they're scantly stored With victual, which is probable to think, They shall endure it worse. Enter the Mayor in haste. Mayor. My Lord, my Lord, The crafts fly forth by thousands from the gates Unorder'd and unled. Earl. Who kept the gates? How came they open? Walter, haste thee, haste! And bring the madmen back. [Exit D'Arlon. How came they so? Mayor. A simple mariner avouch'd, my Lord, That he had heard your Highness's own mouth Give out the order. Earl. Hang the slave! 'twas false. Mayor. So thought the warders; nor had they complied But that the people, being much inflamed, Menaced their lives. Enter a Squire. Squire. Sir Walter, Sir, sends word The town is almost emptied. He entreats Your Highness will not look to bring them back, Which is past hope, but sound at once to arms And send them leaders. Earl. Gilbert, we must forth. Gilbert. Ay, go we forth, and fear not for the end. Fifty to five, we surely must do well, Though peradventure for the sparing lives We might have done more wisely. Earl. Sirs, be sudden; And when you're mounted in the Market-place, I'll give you there your charges. Sound to horse. Scene IV. —The Field of Merle, as in the First Scene. Artevelde, Van Ryk, Van Muck, and others. Artevelde. See'st thou yon sweeping section of the road That leads by Ecdorf to the eastern gate? My eyes are strain'd, but yet I thought I saw A moving mass of men. Van Ryk. I thought so too. When I had held mine eyes a minute fix'd As in a morsel of dry moulder'd cheese I thought I could descry a tumbling movement. Artevelde. Who hath the longest and the clearest sight Of all our men? go bring him. Nay, stop, stop! I think we shall not need him: now, look there. By Heaven, they come! they come! Ha! Van den Bosch! Enter Van Den Bosch. I give you joy! by Heaven we have our wish. Van den Bosch. Yea, Sir, they come, and now, betide what may, We'll mix the Evil One a mess for supper In yonder darksome pool. Artevelde. A ruddier tinge Than ever evening cast shall warm its waters Ere evening colours fade. What ho! Van Serl, Serve out the victual all. But first, to prayers; We will be shriven first, and then we'll sup, And after that we'll cut a road to bed, Be it in Bruges or in a better place. Van Ryk, abide thou here and bring me word If any shall approach by other ways; And when the foremost of the troop we see Have past yon broken wall, then sound thy horn, And I will send thee forces wherewithal To keep thy post. There's food behind the carts, Whereof partake with them I'll send thee. Van Ryk. Nay, I shall want nothing, Sir, Artevelde. I tell thee eat, Eat and be fresh. Anon I'll send a Priest. Van Muck, thou tak'st small comfort in thy prayers; Put thou thy muzzle in yon tub of wine. Now, Van den Bosch, or ere the sun go down We'll know Heaven's will. Van den Bosch. Have with thee, Artevelde! Thou art a man of mettle and my friend, And I would have thee know that should we fall, Either or both, I bear thee now no grudge; And so may Heaven forgive my many sins As I do thee. Artevelde. Why, thou art now thyself. With heart and hand we'll fall upon the foe, And do the work like brothers. Come thy ways. [Exeunt all but Van Ryk and Van Muck. Van Ryk. Van Muck, I prithee step along the path That rounds the hill, and mark if on that side Aught may be stirring. Van Muck. Ay, and if there be I'll shout and hail thee. [Exit. Enter Artevelde's Page. Van Ryk. Why, my little man, How cam'st thou hither? 'tis no place for thee. What, cam'st thou with the army? Page. No, from Bruges. Van Ryk. What took thee there? Page. 'Twas I that took myself. But Mistress Clara wished that I should go. She sojourns with the Prioress of St. Anne Till all be over. Van Ryk. And with her, my boy, Thou shouldst have stay'd. Page. What! in a convent? No, I think not when a battle is toward. Besides, the Prioress was all on edge To hear of what befalls, her sister's son, Sir Walter D'Arlon, being forth; so me They charged to keep good watch and bring them word How he shall fare; but by my halidom I will not run of errands now; I'll fight. Van Ryk. God's mercy on the Knight thou fall'st upon! Nay, nay, content thee; couch thee by yon carts, And dream not thou of fighting. Page. Is it true That some half-hour will bring the battle on? Van Ryk. Less time than that. Thou see'st how fast they come. But now we scarce distinguish'd if they moved, And see,—upon the skirts of yonder mass We may discern them, single man by man. Page. Can you descry the pennons of the Knights That lead them? Van Ryk. Truly, I perceive not one; A multitude—a mass of heads—nought else— No banner, pennon, nor a mounted man. If any Knight be there he comes afoot. Page. The Lord of Arlon surely must be there; He's always with the foremost. Van Ryk. If he be His pennon is not. Page. Nay, but look again; I see some Knights that gallop up behind, And pennons now come streaming on the road Betwixt the town and them. Van Ryk. Good faith, 'tis true. Thou hast sharp eyes. Page. And there—upon the bridge— Whose is that pennon? Van Ryk. I shall know anon, If but yon clump will let me. Come this way And we shall see them better. Through the gap. Scene V. —Another part of the Field. Artevelde and others. Artevelde. Their cross-bow shafts have touch'd us on that side, And ours fly large. We're dazzled by the sun. Bid Van den Bosch give gently back and back And wind them round the slough; I'll hover here; And soon as he have turn'd his back o' the sun Let him stand fast and shoot. Thou hast thine errand; Let it not cool. And you, Sirs, follow me. Scene VI. —Another part of the Field. The Lord of Arlon and Gilbert Matthew. Gilbert. How came they thus? My Lord, I needs must say A soldier's courage, not a leader's skill, Has placed them here. D'Arlon. Skill! what can skill avail? Could skill have made men sober that were drunk? The meanest archer with his senses whole Would not have rush'd to stare the sun i' the face As these have done; nothing could stop them, sots! Gilbert. They will not long hold out. D'Arlon. I prithee fly, And tell the Earl to send us succours up. I'll keep them steady, if I can, till then. Scene VII. —Another part of the Field. Artevelde's Page following an Archer. Page. Stay, hearken. Archer. Od's my body! what is here? A mannikin at arms? Why clutch me, friend? Art thou afraid? Page. Take that for asking. Archer. Slain With buffet of a mighty man of war! Well, thou hast mettle; what's hy will with me? Page. I am thy Captain's page; he sends to know Where D'Arlon fights. Archer. So; stop, then; with thine eye If thou canst follow forth yon grey stone wall Down to the hollow, and where farther on Again it rises, thou shalt see a crowd Of fighting men, and in their thickest front The pennon of the Lord of Arlon flies— By Heaven! But I think no—a minute since It there was flying, but I think 'tis down. [Exit Page. Enter Artevelde, with Followers from the one side, and Van Ryk with Followers from the other. Artevelde. How is't with you? On our side all is well. One half their host is founder'd in the swamp, The other full in flight. Van Ryk. On our side too They all have fled; but farther down the field The D'Arlon still stands fast. Artevelde. Set on,—set on— Make for the spot. But hurt ye not that Knight. Scene VIII. —A Street in Bruges.—It is Night.—The Earl of Flanders and Sir Robert Mareschault enter, preceded by Attendants bearing torches. Earl. What succours we can find I'll lead myself. Was ever such disaster! Madmen first, And cowards after! Enter a Soldier in haste. Soldier. Fly, my Lord! fly, fly! The gates are lost; they're now within the walls. Earl. Why say they are, and must I therefore fly? Make for the Market-place; we'll rally there Whoever will be rallied.—Pass we on— Lights to the Market-place. Enter another Soldier. Soldier. Is't you, my Lord? Oh! not that way! the men of Ghent are there. Fly, fly, my Lord! Earl. The men of Ghent are where? Soldier. I' the Market-place, my Lord. Earl. Already there! Sir Robert. Put out your lights. Earl. Ay, truly, now all's lost. Put out your lights, good fellows all, and fly. Save me ye cannot, and ye may yourselves. [The lights are extinguished. Which way to turn I know not. Sir Robert. Down the street I see the flash of cressets that come hither; Hence, in God's name! Here, varlet, doff thy cloak, And give it to my Lord. Earl. Throw mine away, Or it might else betray thy life; get hence; But if thou fallest in the enemy's hands, Have a good tongue; say not thou saw'st me here. Adieu, Sir Robert; each the other hazards By holding thus together. Sir Robert Sir, Farewell. [Exit. [The Earl, left alone, knocks at the door of a house; a window is opened above and a woman looks out. Woman. Who's he that knocks? Earl. A much endanger'd man. Woman. We're all endanger'd on such nights as these. I cannot let thee in. Earl. I pray thee, do. Woman. Art thou a man-at-arms? Earl. Yea, truly. Woman. Ah! Then get thee gone; they'll ransack every house To hunt out men-at-arms. Go, get thee gone. Earl. I have no arms upon me. Woman. Get thee gone! Earl. I am the Earl of Flanders. Woman. Good my Lord! O mercy! my good Lord, and is it you? Woe's me! I'll ope the door. The many times That alms were given me at your Lordship's gate And I to hold you haggling here! Woe's me! [She descends and opens the door. Come in, my gracious Lord; up yonder steps You'll find a cock-loft and a couch of straw; Betwixt the mattress and the boards lie flat, And you may well be hidden. Here are lights! Come in, come in. [They enter the house. Enter Van Muck, followed by several Men of Ghent. He knocks at the door. Van Muck. No answer? Nay then, knock me in this door. [The woman opens it. Woman. Why, valiant Sirs, you would not sure molest A widow and her children. Van Muck. Who's within? Woman. Three helpless orphans; as I hope for grace; No soul beside. Van Muck. Wilt take thy oath of that? Woman. I pray God strike me dead upon the threshold If any be within but my three babes, Myk, Lodowyk, and Jan. Van Muck. Why, as we came We saw a man go in. Woman. Good Sir, good Sir, You are deceived; there was no man at all; 'Twas I look'd out and emptied down a bucket! A man! God help us; no. Van Muck. Go in and see. [Some of the men enter the house. Woman. Walk in, your worships; pray walk in—walk in. You see my humble house: one room below, And one above. Sir, will you not walk in? Van Muck. No, no; I'll keep the door. Woman. These times, sweet Sir, Are hard for widow'd women and their babes. [The men come out again. One of the Men. 'Tis as she says: three children are asleep; Three in the cock-loft; there is none beside. Van Muck. Good even to you, Dame. Friends, follow me. [Exeunt Van Muck and his Men. Woman. Beshrew your hearts, ye filthy dogs of Ghent! The Devil catch you by the throat! for once You've miss'd your game. Ah, gracious Lord, away! Scene IX. —The Market-place of Bruges.—In front, Artevelde with Clara and D'Arlon. Next, Ukenheim, Frans Ackerman, Van Nuitre,and other Leaders. Behind them are crowds of armed Followers and Attendants bearing torches, of whom some companies march off from time to time under orders from their Captains and others remain keeping guard over prisoners and spoil. Artevelde. War hath dealt hardly with the noble D'Arlon; Him gold not ransoms, and to stricter bonds A captive Knight was never yet consign'd. [Turning to his Followers. Van Muck returns not. Who amongst you all Hath eye of lynx and leveret's foot to speed Through all the town with inquisition sure And leave no corner of a house unsearch'd? Where is Van Ryk? Ukenheim. He left us at the gates. Artevelde. True, true, upon a mission sent by me. He will be here anon. Then Ukenheim, Go thou, with such assistance as thou wilt, Upon the quest, through every lane and street. Take him, if possibly ye can, alive. Evil and folly hath he wrought against us, But never treason; he had wrong'd us less But for the renegades that gave him counsel. Bring forth the Lord of Occo. [Occo is brought forward bound. So, my Lord! Enter Van Muck and his party. Another? Van Muck. Gilbert Matthew, Sir, we bring. Artevelde. And not the Earl? Van Muck. No; he, they say, escaped, And took the road to Lisle. He lay some space Hid in a hovel till the search went by, And then he slunk away. Artevelde. Long must thou wait, Earl, ere thou see thy heritage again! Bring Gilbert Matthew forth. [He is brought in bound. So, Gilbert Matthew! Gilbert. Young upstart, what wouldst thou with Gilbert Matthew? Artevelde. Be patient, Sir; you'll know it. Where art thou, Frans Ackerman? Despatch ere break of day A hundred waggons on the road to Ghent Laden with corn and wine. That done, send forth To Damme and Sluys and empty out their stores For a fresh convoy. Have me men prepared To ride to Ypres, Courtray, Cassel, Bergues, To Poperinguen and to Roussaelere, And bid the Mayor and Burghers of each town Send me its keys. Well met, bold Van den Bosch! Enter Van den Bosch, with Followers. Well met at Bruges, my brethren in arms! As ye were brave, so be ye temperate now. Let not the small-crafts suffer. Spare their blood, For they but follow'd in the train of power And many wished us in their hearts no ill. To all shall plunder plentifully flow Out of the coffers of the rich; but him That spills a foreigner's or craftsman's blood I mulct of all his share, and, this night past, The price (not willingly so long postponed, But needfully for this tumultuous night) Of all blood-guiltiness is paid in blood. Take heed of what I say; ye ought to know For good or ill my promises are kept. The debt of vengeance justly due to Ghent Ye shall behold acquitted where ye stand. [Turning to Occo and Gilbert Matthew. Look, Van den Bosch, upon your former friends, And say what they deserve. Van den Bosch. In this world death, And after that let Satan tend his own. I should commend their bodies to the rack But that I'm loth so long to keep their souls Out of hell-fire. Occo. Thy heart was ever hard; But, Artevelde, thou wilt not stain thy hands By killing in cold blood two helpless men! If thou'rt a soldier, do not such a deed. Soldiers by soldiers in the field are slain, Not murder'd in the market-place. Artevelde. Agreed; And if the name of soldier can be claim'd By both or one of you, ye shall not die. Bring forth the Friar. [A Friar is brought forward. Save you, holy Sir! Say in the face of these two that stand here That which thou said'st to me. Friar. Sir, it was this: Here in the hospital expired but now Of many wounds a Florentine, by name Romero, who, repentant ere his death, Confessed an impious contract, for a bribe From Gilbert Matthew and Sir Guy of Occo, To kill the Lord of Arlon, for some spite That each had to him. Occo. Miscreant, he lied! Whoe'er procured him, it was never I. Master Van Artevelde, and you, my Lord, Believe not I would sin in such a sort. Have mercy on a miserable man! [Falls on his knees. Oh God! there's some mistake, or else he lied. Gilbert. How say'st thou that he lied? Sirs, it is true, I with this craven beggarly companion— Of whose accompliceship to do the deed And not the deed itself I speak with shame— I with this caitiff truly did conspire For good and ample reasons to remove Sir Walter D'Arlon from this troublesome world. Such chances as no prudence could forefend Have baulk'd my purpose and I go myself. Wherefore, Sirs, God be with you! To the block! What are ye dreaming of, ye sluggish hinds? Artevelde (signing to the men-at-arms who lead out Gilbert Matthew). Ay, Gilbert, God forgive thee for thy sins! Thou steppest statelily the only walk Thou hast to take on earth. Full many a man That lives a godlier life less bravely dies. Take forth Sir Guy of Occo. Occo. Hear me yet. If through pretext of justice I am doomed, What justice is it that believes not me And yet believes such villains as Romero And Gilbert Matthew? Find a credible tongue To testify against me ere you strike. Enter Van Ryk, conducting Adriana. Artevelde. Behold the witness! Look upon this face And bid death welcome. Lead him to the block. Adriana. Oh, spare him; speak not now of shedding blood, Now, in the hour that Heaven has rescued us; Vengeance is God's, whose function take not thou; Spare him, Van Artevelde, oh! spare his life! Artevelde. Not though an Angel plead. Vengeance is God's; But God doth oftentimes dispense it here By human ministration. To my hands He render'd victory this eventful day For uses of His own, and this is one. Let Flanders judge me from my deeds to-night, That I from this time forth will do His will; Justice with mercy tempering where I may, But executing always. Take him hence. [Occo is led out. Now, Adriana, I am wholly thine. The curtain falls upon the fancied stage, The tale half told: here rest thee, reader sage; Pause here and trim thine intellectual light, Which, more than mine, shall make my meanings bright. That ancient writer whose romantic heart Loved war in every shape,—its pride, its art, Its shows, appurtenance,—whose page is still The theatre of war turn where we will,— That old historian of whose truthful text I dog the heels,—me whither leads he next? To dark descents he guides me; sad and stern, Him following forth, the lesson that I learn: That in the shocks of powers so wild and rude Success but signifies vicissitude; That of that man who seeks a sovran sphere The triumph is the trial most severe. And yet in times so stormy, in a land Where Virtue's self held forth a bloody hand To greet arm'd Justice,—in such times as these Still woman's love could find the way to please. Thus in the tissue of my tale, herein By records not unvouch'd, again I spin, As heretofore, an interwoven thread Of feminine affection fancy-fed. —Rest thee a space: or if thou lov'st to hear A soft pulsation in thine easy ear, Turn thou the page and let thy senses drink A lay that shall not trouble thee to think. Quitting the heroine of the past, thou'lt see In this prefigured her that is to be, And find what life was hers before the date That with the Fleming's fortunes link'd her fate. This sang she to herself one summer's eve A recreant from festivities that grieve The heart not festive; stealing to her bower With this she wiled away the lonely evening hour. THE LAY OF ELENA. He ask'd me had I yet forgot The mountains of my native land? I sought an answer, but had not The words at my command. They would not come, and it was better so, For had I utter'd aught, my tears I know Had started at the word as free to flow. But I can answer when there's none that hears; And now if I should weep, none sees my tears; And in my soul the voice is rising strong That speaks in solitude,—the voice of song. Yes, I remember well The land of many hues, Whose charms what praise can tell, Whose praise what heart refuse? Sublime, but neither bleak nor bare Nor misty, are the mountains there,— Softly sublime, profusely fair! Up to their summits clothed in green And fruitful as the vales between They lightly rise And scale the skies, And groves and gardens still abound, For where no shoot Could else take root The peaks are shelved and terraced round; Earthward appear in mingled growth The mulberry and maize,—above, The trellised vine extends to both The leafy shade they love. Looks out the white-wall'd cottage here; The lowly chapel rises near; Far down the foot must roam to reach The lovely lake and bending beach; Whilst chestnut green and olive gray Chequer the steep and winding way. A bark is launch'd on Como's lake, A maiden sits abaft; A little sail is loosed to take The night wind's breath and waft The maiden and her bark away Across the lake and up the bay. And what doth there that lady fair Upon the wavelet toss'd? Before her shines the evening star, Behind her in the woods afar The castle lights are lost. What doth she there? The evening air Lifts her locks and her neck is bare, And the dews that now are falling fast May work her harm, or a rougher blast May come from yonder cloud, And that her bark might scarce sustain, So slightly built, and why remain, And would she be allow'd To brave the wind and sit in the dew At night on the lake if her mother knew? Her mother sixteen years before The burthen of the baby bore; And though brought forth in joy, the day So joyful, she was wont to say, In taking count of after years, Gave birth to fewer hopes than fears. For seldom smiled The serious child, And as she pass'd from childhood, grew More far-between those smiles and few, More sad and wild. And though she loved her father well And though she loved her mother more, Upon her heart a sorrow fell And sapp'd it to the core. And in her father's castle nought She ever found of what she sought, And all her pleasure was to roam Among the mountains far from home, And through thick woods, and wheresoe'er She saddest felt to sojourn there; And much she loved to linger afloat On the lonely lake in the little boat. It was not for the forms,—though fair, Though grand they were beyond compare,— It was not only for the forms Of hills in sunshine or in storms, Or only unrestrain'd to look On wood and lake, that she forsook By day or night Her home, and far Wander'd by light Of sun or star. It was to feel her fancy free, Free in a world without an end, With ears to hear and eyes to see And heart to apprehend. It was to leave the earth behind And rove with liberated mind, As fancy led or choice or chance, Through wildered regions of romance. And many a castle would she build And all around the woods were fill'd With Knights and Squires that rode amain, With ladies saved and giants slain; And as some contest waver'd, came, With eye of fire and breath of flame, A dragon that in cave profound Had had his dwelling under-ground; And he had closed the dubious fight, But that, behold! there came in sight A hippogriff, that wheel'd his flight Far in the sky, then swooping low Brings to the field a fresher foe; Dismay'd by this diversion, fly The dragon and his dear ally; And now the victor Knight unties The prisoner, his unhoped-for prize, And lo! a beauteous maid is she, Whom they, in their unrighteous guise, Had fasten'd naked to a tree! Much dreaming these, yet was she much awake To portions of things earthly, for the sake Whereof, as with a charm, away would flit The phantoms, and the fever intermit. Whatso' of earthly things presents a face Of outward beauty or a form of grace Might not escape her, hidden though it were From courtly recognition; for with her Nature's high heraldry in a peasant's face Awarded him pre-eminence of place; Give but a handmaid majesty of mien, The handmaid rose in station to a Queen. Devoted thus to what was fair to sight She loved too little else, nor this aright; And many disappointments could not cure This born obliquity, or break the lure Which this strong passion spread: she grew not wise, Nor grows: experience with a world of sighs Purchased, and tears and heart-break, have been hers, And taught her nothing: where she err'd she errs. Be it avow'd, when all is said, She trod the path the many tread;— She loved too soon in life; her dawn Was bright with sunbeams, whence is drawn A sure prognostic that the day Will not unclouded pass away. Too young she loved, and he on whom Her first love lighted, in the bloom Of boyhood was, and so was graced With all that earliest runs to waste. Intelligent, loquacious, mild, Yet gay and sportive as a child, With feelings light and quick, that came And went, like flickerings of flame; A soft demeanour, and a mind Bright and abundant in its kind, That, playing on the surface, made A rapid change of light and shade, Or if a darker hour perforce At times o'ertook him in his course, Still sparkling thick like glow-worms, show'd Life was to him a summer's road;— Such was the youth to whom a love For grace and beauty far above Their due deserts, betray'd a heart Which might have else perform'd a loftier part. First love the world is wont to call The passion which was now her all. So be it call'd; but be it known The feeling which possess'd her now Was novel in degree alone; Love early mark'd her for his own; Soon as the winds of heaven had blown Upon her, had the seed been sown In soil which needed not the plough; And passion with her growth had grown And strengthen'd with her strength, and how Could love be new, unless in name, Degree, and singleness of aim? A tenderness had fill'd her mind Pervasive, viewless, undefined;— As keeps the subtle fluid oft Its secret, gathering in the soft And sultry air, till felt at length In all its desolating strength, So silent, so devoid of dread, Her objectless affections spread: Not wholly unemploy'd, but squander'd At large where'er her fancy wander'd; Till one attraction, one desire Concentred all the scatter'd fire; It broke, it burst, it blazed amain, It flash'd its light o'er hill and plain, O'er earth below and heaven above,— And then it took the name of love. How fared that love? the tale so old, So common, needs it to be told? Bellagio's woods, ye saw it through From first accost to last adieu; Its changes, seasons, you can tell,— At least you typify them well. First came the genial, hopeful spring, With bursting buds and birds that sing, And fast though fitful progress made To brighter suns and broader shade; Those brighter suns, that broader shade, They came, and richly then array'd Was bough and sward, and all below Gladden'd by summer's equal glow. What next? a change is slowly seen, And deepeneth day by day The darker, soberer, sadder green Prevenient to decay. Yet still at times through that green gloom, As sudden gusts might make them room And lift the spray so light, The berries of the mountain-ash, Arching the torrent's foam and flash, Waved gladly into sight. But rare those short-lived gleamings grew And wore the woods a sicklier hue; Destruction now his phalanx forms 'Mid wailing winds and gathering storms; And last comes Winter's withering breath, Keen as desertion, cold-cold as the hand of death! Is the tale told? Too well, alas! Is pictured here what came to pass. So long as light affections play'd Around their path, he loved the maid; Loved in half gay, half tender mood, By passion touch'd but not subdued; Laugh'd at the flame he felt or lit; Replied to tenderness with wit; Sometimes when passion brightlier burned Its tokens eagerly return'd; Then calm, supine, but pleased no less, Softly sustain'd each soft caress. She, watching with delight the while His half-closed eyes and gradual smile, (Slow pleasure's smile, how far more worth, More beautiful than smiles of mirth!) Seemed to herself when back she cast A hurried glance upon the past, As changed from what she then had been, As was the moon, who, having run Her orbit through since this begun, Now shone apparent Queen. How dim a world, how blank a waste, A shadowy orb how faintly traced, Her crescent fancy first embraced! How fair an orb, a world how bright, How fill'd with glory and with light, Had now reveal'd itself to sight,— A glory of her essence grown, A light incorporate with her own! Forth from such paradise of bliss Open the way and easy is, Like that renown'd of old; And easier than the most was this, For they were sorted more amiss Than outwards things foretold. The Goddess that with cruel mirth The daughters and the sons of earth Mismatches, hath a cunning eye In twisting of a treacherous tie; Nor is she backward to perceive That loftier minds to lower cleave With ampler love (as that which flows From a rich source) than these to those; For still the source, not object, gives The daily food whereon love lives. The well-spring of his love was poor Compared to hers: his gifts were fewer; The total light that was in him Before a spark of hers grew dim; Too high, too grave, too large, too deep, Her love could neither laugh nor sleep— And thus it tired him; his desire Was for a less consuming fire: He wish'd that she should love him well, Not wildly; wish'd her passion's spell To charm her heart but leave her fancy free; To quicken converse, not to quell; He granted her to sigh, for so could he; But when she wept, why should it be? 'Twas irksome, for it stole away The joy of his love-holiday. Bred of such uncongenial mood At length would some dim doubt intrude If what he felt, so far below Her passion's pitch, were love or no. With that the common daylight's beam Broke in upon his morning dream, And as that common day advanced His heart was wholly unentranced. What follow'd was not good to do, Nor is it good to tell; The anguish of that worst adieu Which parts with love and honour too Abides not,—so far well. The human heart can not sustain Prolong'd inalterable pain, And not till reason cease to reign Will nature want some moments brief Of other moods to mix with grief; Such and so hard to be destroyed That vigour which abhors a void, And in the midst of all distress, Such nature's need for happiness! And when she rallied thus, more high Her spirits ran, she knew not why, Than was their wont in times than these Less troubled, with a heart at ease. So meet extremes; so joy's rebound Is highest from the hollowest ground; So vessels with the storm that strive Pitch higher as they deeplier dive. Well had it been if she had curb'd These transports of a mind disturb'd; For grief is then the worst of foes When, all intolerant of repose, It sends the heart abroad to seek From weak recoils exemptions weak; After false gods to go astray, Deck altars vile with garlands gay, And place a painted form of stone On Passion's abdicated throne. Till then her heart was as a mound Or simple plot of garden-ground Far in a forest wild, Where many a seedling had been sown And many a bright-eyed floweret grown To please a favourite child. Delighted was the child to call The plot of garden-ground her own; Delighted was she at the fall Of evening mild, when shadows tall Cross-barr'd the mound and cottage wall, To linger there alone. Nor seem'd the garden flowers less fair, Nor loved she less to linger there, When glisten'd in the morning dew Each lip of red and eye of blue; And when the sun too brightly burn'd Towards the forest's verge she turn'd Where stretch'd away from glade to glade A green interminable shade; And in the skirts thereof a bower Was built with many a creeping flower For shelter at the noon-tide hour; And from the forest walks was heard The voice of many a singing-bird, With murmurs of the cushat-dove That tell the secret of her love: And pleasant therefore all day long From earliest dawn to even-song, Supremely pleasant was this wild Sweet garden to the woodsman's child. The whirlwind came with fire and flood And smote the garden in the wood; All that was formed to give delight Destruction levell'd in a night; The morning broke, the child awoke, And when she saw what sudden stroke The garden which she loved had swept To ruin, she sat down and wept. Her grief was great, but it had vent; Its force, not spared, was sooner spent; And she bethought her to repair The garden which had been so fair. Then roam'd she through the forest walks Cropping the wild-flowers by their stalks, And divers full-blown blossoms gay She gather'd, and in fair array Disposed, and stuck them in the mound Which once had been her garden-ground. They seem'd to flourish for a while, A moment's space she seem'd to smile; But brief the bloom and vain the toil, They were not native to the soil. That other child, beneath whose zone Were passions fearfully full-grown,— She too essay'd to deck the waste Where love had grown, which love had graced, With false adornments, flowers not fruit, Fast-fading flowers that strike not root, With pleasures alien to her breast That bloom but briefly at the best, The world's sad substitutes for joys To minds that lose their equipoise. On Como's lake the evening star Is trembling as before; An azure flood, a golden bar, There as before they were they are, But she that loved them—she is far, Far from her native shore. No more is seen her slender boat Upon the star-lit lake afloat, With oar or sail at large to rove, Or tether'd in its wooded cove 'Mid gentle waves that sport around And rock it with a gurgling sound. Keel up, it rots upon the strand, Its gunwale sunken in the sand, Where suns and tempests warp'd and shrank Each shatter'd rib and riven plank. Never again that land-wreck'd craft Shall feel the billow boom abaft; Never when springs the freshening gale, Take life again from oar or sail: Nor shall the freight that once it bore Again be seen on lake or shore. A foreign land is now her choice, A foreign sky above her, And unfamiliar is each voice Of those that say they love her. A Prince's palace is her home, And marble floor and gilded dome, Where festive myriads nightly meet Quick echoes of her steps repeat. And she is gay at times, and light From her makes many faces bright; And circling flatterers hem her in, Assiduous each a word to win, And smooth as mirrors each the while Reflects and multiplies her smile. But fitful were her smiles, nor long She cast them to that courtly throng; And should the sound of music fall Upon her ear in that high hall, The smile was gone, the eye that shone So brightly would be dimm'd anon, And objectless would then appear As stretched to check the starting tear; The chords within responsive rung, For music spoke her native tongue. And then the gay and glittering crowd Is heard not, laugh they ne'er so loud; Nor then is seen the simpering row Of flatterers, bend they ne'er so low; For there before her where she stands The mountains rise, the lake expands; Around the terraced summit twines The leafy coronal of vines; Within the watery mirror deep Nature's calm converse lies asleep; Above she sees the sky's blue glow, The forest's varied green below, And far its vaulted vistas through A distant grove of darker hue, Where mounting high from clumps of oak Curls lightly up the thin gray smoke; And o'er the boughs that over-bower The crag, a castle's turrets tower— An eastern casement mantled o'er With ivy, flashes back the gleam Of sunrise—it was there of yore She sate to see that sunrise pour Its splendour round—she sees no more, For tears disperse the dream. Thus seized and speechless had she stood, Surveying mountain, lake, and wood, When to her ear came that demand Did she forget her native land? 'Twas but a voice within replied She had forgotten all beside. For words are weak and most to seek When wanted fifty-fold, And then if silence will not speak Or trembling lip and changing cheek, There's nothing told. But could she have reveal'd to him Who question'd thus, the vision bright That ere his words were said grew dim And vanish'd from her sight, Easy the answer were to know And plain to understand,— That mind and memory both must fail, And life itself must slacken sail, And thought its functions must forego, And fancy lose its latest glow, Or ere that land Could pictured be less bright and fair To her whose home and heart are there! That land, the loveliest that eye can see, The stranger ne'er forgets, then how should she? —Cease the soft sounds, the mellow voice is mute, And quivers to a close that plaintive lady's lute.— Pass we to matters masculine; to strains Where weightier themes may pay the reader's pains. Again disclose we counsels of the wise, Deeds of the warlike: let the curtain rise. END OF THE FIRST PART. PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.

Scene I. —An Anteroom to the State Apartments of the Grand Justiciary in the Royal Palace at Senlis in France.—Several groups of Suitors holding Petitions in their hands. In front a Yeoman of Tournesis, and near him Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Sir Fleureant. If I may be so bold, friend, whence art thou? The times are stirring, and come whence thou may'st Thou must bring news. Yeoman. So please your worship's grace I come from this side Tournay; I am French, And though I say it, Sir, an honest yeoman. Sir Fleureant. And, honest yeoman, what's thine errand here? Yeoman. I have a suit, Sir, to my noble Lord The Duke of Burgundy? Sir Fleureant. Why, what?—what suit? Yeoman. 'Tis but for justice, Sir; I crave but that. Sir Fleureant. Hast thou the price of justice in thy pocket? Yeoman. The price of justice? Nay, Sir, I am poor. Sir Fleureant. Poor and want justice!—where was thy mother's thrift To bring thee up in such a poor estate And yet to lack such dainties? Say wherein Wouldst thou be justified? Who is't hath wrong'd thee? Yeoman. Last Wednesday, Sir, a troop of Flemings, led By fierce Frans Ackerman, the frontier pass'd And burn'd my homestead, ravaged all my fields, And did sore havoc in the realm of France. Sir Fleureant. What say'st thou? is it so? Ha, ha! my friend, This is high matter; thou'lt be heard on this. Enter Usher. Usher. Depart ye, Sirs; his Grace is with the King; He bids you all depart and come to-morrow; To-day his Grace hath business with the King And will not be molested; go at once; Their Graces and the King are coming hither And would be private;—prithee, Sir, depart. [To the Yeoman, who lingers. Sir Fleureant. Take thou thy grievance to the outer hall, But go no further hence. Soft, Master Usher; My friend shall have an audience of the Duke. Look he be carefully bestow'd without Till he be call'd. He is an injured man; An injured man, and welcome not the less. The grief he hath is worth its weight in gold. Bestow him carefully without. Usher. This way. [Exit, with the Yeoman. Enter the Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon. Burgundy. Good morrow, Flurry. Not on us, good brother; I grant you were we rashly to make war, No Council summon'd, no Estates convened, Then aught that should unhappily ensue Might chance be charged on us, as natural guides, And so reputed, of the youthful King. But back'd by all the Council,—yea, by all, For I'll be warranty no voice dissents,— Back'd by the Council, wherein weighty reasons Shall be well urged— Bourbon. Ay, brother, there it is! That you have reasons of your own none doubts, And Jacques Bonhomme will be bold to say That reasons which are rank in Burgundy Have been transplanted to the soil of France That fits them not. Burgundy. In Jacques Bonhomme's throat I'll tell him that he slanders me and lies. No soil in Christendom but fits my reasons; No soil where virtue, chivalry, and faith Are fed and flourish, but shall fit them well. When honour and nobility fall prone In Flanders, think you they stand fast in France? Or losing ground in France, have hope elsewhere? This by no narrow bound is circumscribed: It is the cause of chivalry at large. Though heir to Flanders I am Frenchman born, And nearer have at heart the weal of France Than my far-off inheritance. Come, come; Lay we before the Council the sad truth Of these distractions that so rock the realm,— Paris possess'd by Nicholas le Flamand, Where law's a nothing and the King a name; Armies with mallets but beginning there, And gathering like the snow-wreaths in a storm Before a man hath time to get him housed, At Chalons on the Marne, Champagne, Beauvoisin, At Orleans, at Rheims, at Blois, and Rouen, And every reach of road from Paris south: Then point we to the north, where Artevelde Wields at his single will the Flemish force, A hundred thousand swords; and ask what fate Awaits our France, if those with these unite, Bold villans both, and ripe for riving down All royalty,—thereafter or therewith Nobility!—Then strike whiles yet apart Each single foe. Bourbon. But Philip speaks us fair. Burgundy. If fair, then false. Sir Fleureant. My Lords, there's proof of that Here close at hand; a yeoman from Tournesis But now arrived with news of ravage done On the French frontier. Burgundy. There, good brother, there! There's Flemish friendship, Flemish love of peace! Shall we make nought of this? Bourbon. We'll sift the tale, And find if it be true. Burgundy. Where is the man? Sir Fleureant. I'll bring him in, my Lord; he's here at hand. [Exit. Enter the King with a Hawk on his hand. Burgundy. How now, my royal cousin, have you done? Can you repeat the speech? King. O yes, good uncle. “Right noble our liege Councillors, all, We greet you! We have required your—” Burgundy. Presence here this day. King. “We have required your presence here this day On matters of high import, which surcharge Our royal mind, that still affects the weal Of our beloved lieges. Much to peace Our tender years incline us, but—but—but—” I'll fly my hawk, good uncle, now; to-morrow I'll say the rest. Come, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry! He is a Marzarolt, uncle, just reclaim'd; The best in France for flying at the fur. Whew! Jerry, Jerry, Jerry! Burgundy. Cousin, stay. Enter Sir Fleureant with the Yeoman. Here is a worthy yeoman from Tournesis Who hath a tale to tell of ravage done Upon the realm of France. King. A yeoman, uncle? Here, worthy yeoman, you shall kiss our hand. Get off there, Jerry. [The Yeoman kneels and kisses his hand. Bourbon. Now, Sir, from what place, In France or Flanders, com'st thou? Yeoman. Please you, Sir, 'Twas a small holding from my lord of Vergues, Close to the liberties of Fontenoy. Bourbon. This side the Bourn? Yeoman. Three miles, my Lord, no less. Burgundy. Three miles in France. Bourbon. And what befell thee there? Yeoman. My Lord, my wife and I, on Wednesday night, Saw fires to the north and westward, up by Orcq And round to Beau-Renard, and knew by that The Flemish Commons had been there, that late Have roam'd through Flanders, burning where they came The houses of the Gentlemen and Knights. Then said my wife (Pierilla, if it please you), “'Tis well we're yeomen and of poor estate, And that we're lieges of a mightier Lord Than was the Count of Flanders: praised be God! Or else might they that look from Beau-Renard To south and eastward, see this house on fire To-morrow night, as we this night see theirs!” But hardly had she said it, when due south The sky was all on fire; and then we knew The Flemings were in France, and Auzain burn'd. We fled at once, and looking back, beheld Our humble dwelling flaming like a torch. So then, quoth I, we'll to my Lord the King, And tell what's come to pass. Burgundy. Thou hast done well; Retire: His Grace will shortly bring thy wrongs Before the Council. Hold thyself prepared To tell thy story there. [Exit Yeoman. Wild work! wild work! I think my royal cousin, though he's young, Bears yet a mind too mettlesome to brook Such injuries as these. Your Grace has heard: The Flemish hordes lift plunder in your realm, Driving your subjects from their peaceful homes, Burning, destroying, wheresoe'er they reach, And ever on nobility they fall With sharpest tooth; let this have leave to grow, And French insurgents shall from Flemish learn The tricks of treason, German boors from both, Till Kings and Princes, Potentates and Peers, Landgraves, Electors, Palatines, and Prelates, Dukes, Earls, and Knights, shall be no more esteemed Than as the noblest and the loftiest trees Which the woodwarden as he walks the forest Marks for the axe. Our warlike cousin King When once he takes the field shall give short shrift To the base Flemings, and with one sharp blow Cut off some twenty thousand treasons, hatched, Accursed, pernicious brood! beneath the wings Of this Van Artevelde, that chipp'd the shell Two months agone when Paris grew too hot To hold us, and that now are fledged and enter'd. I would your Grace were even now in arms, Leading your gallant troops. King. To-morrow, uncle! We will be arm'd and lead our troops to-morrow. We'll ride the chestnut with the bells at his heels. Bourbon. Nay, softly! Should the Council when it meets Declare for war, your force can not so soon Be drawn together as your Highness thinks, Though lying mainly hereabouts. Burgundy. Well, well! Speak boldly to the Council as to us, And if you'd presently be in the field Be diligent to learn your speech—come in— Both that you have and something I shall add Touching this yeoman's grief—come in with me— Ho! take away this hawk—and you shall have it. [Exeunt Duke of Burgundy and the King. Bourbon. My brother, Fleureant, is all too hot In this affair; he's ever taking starts And leaving them that he should hold in hand. He'll fright the Council from their calmer sense And drive them to some rash resolve. Sir Fleureant. My Lord, You shall perceive to-morrow at the board How vast and voluble a thing is wit, And what a sway a little of it hath With Councillors of State. My Lord your brother Will blaze and thunder through a three hours' speech, And stamp and strike his fist upon the board, Whilst casements rattling and a fall of soot Shall threaten direful war. Bourbon. The Constable, The Earls of Ewe and Blois, St. Poule and Laval, Guesclin, St. Just, the Seneschal of Rieux, Raoul of Raneval,—all these and more Look, to my knowledge, clean the other way. They deem a mission should be set on foot Before the sword be drawn; and with my will Nought else shall come to pass. Sir Fleureant. Van Artevelde, Though obstinate at times, is politic too, And lacks not understanding; he'll not brave The wrath of France if he be well approached. Bourbon. I spake with one last night who came from Bruges And on his way had sojourn'd in the camp At Oudenarde, where, when the turbulent towns Behind his back can spare him from their broils, Van Artevelde o'ersees the leaguering force. There was a market in the camp, he said, And all things plentiful,—fruit, cheese, and wine, All kinds of mercery, cloth, furs, and silks, With trinketry, the plunder daily brought By Van den Bosch's marauders. Went and came All men that chose from Brabant, Hainault, Liege, And Germany; but Frenchmen were forbidden. Van Artevelde, he said, in all things apes The state and bearing of a Sovereign Prince; Has bailiffs, masters of the horse, receivers, A chamber of accompt, an audience hall, Off gold and silver eats, is clad in robes Of scarlet furr'd with minever, gives feasts With minstrelsy and dancing night and day To damsels and to ladies,—whom amongst Pre-eminent is that Italian minx The girl El?na, late a toy of mine. To Bruges in company with me she came, Where waiting till on my return from Liege I could rejoin her, to the conqueror's hands She fell when Bruges was taken. Sir Fleureant. Soh, my Lord! That lady hath a hook that twitches still. If what I heard in Gascony be true In vain you claim'd her from Van Artevelde, Who answer'd not your missives. Bourbon. True it is; And he shall answer for so answering not, If any voice of potency be mine Touching this war. But he may yet take thought And make amends; I'll send him once again A message, and I know not who's so fit To take it as thyself. Sir Fleureant. My Lord, my tongue Can utter nought with so much grace by half As what you bid it speak. Bourbon. Then thou shalt go. Not that for foolishness and woman's love I would do this or that, but thou shalt note My honour is impawn'd. Some half-hour hence Come to my chamber, where in privacy We'll further speak of this; and bring thou there The yeoman of Tournesis; he must learn How to demean himself before the Board. He has been tamper'd with, I nothing doubt, And what he's tutor'd to must we unteach. Things run too fast to seed. [Exit. Sir Fleureant. What soldier's heart By dotage such as his was e'er possess'd Upon a paramour! To win her back Peace, war, or anything to him were good, Nought evil but what works contrariwise. And still his love goes muffled up for shame, And masks itself with show of careless slights And giving her ill names of jade and minx, Gipsy and slut.—The world's a masquerade, And he whose wisdom is to pay it court Should mask his own unpopular penetration And seem to think its several seemings real. Scene II. —The Flemish Camp before Oudenarde. A Platform in front of Artevelde's Tent. Enter Artevelde and Van Ryk. Van Ryk. You seem fatigued, my Lord. Artevelde. Look to that horse; he coughs. I think I am; The sun was hot for such a long day's ride. What is the hour? Van Ryk. The moon has not yet risen, It cannot yet be nine. Artevelde. Not nine? well, well; “Be the day never so long At length cometh evensong”— So saith the ancient rhyme. At eight o'clock We crossed the bridge at Rosebecque; eight o'clock, Or thereabouts. Van Ryk. 'Twas thereabouts, my Lord. Artevelde. Was anything of moment in your thoughts As we were crossing? Van Ryk. In my thoughts, my Lord? Nothing to speak of. Artevelde. Well now, it is strange! I never knew myself to sleep o'horseback, And yet I must have slept. The evening's heat Had much oppress'd me; then the tedious tract Of naked moorland, and the long flat road And slow straight stream, for ever side by side Like poverty and crime—I'm sure I slept. Van Ryk. I saw not that you did, my Lord. Artevelde. I did; Ay, and dream'd too. 'Twas an unwholesome dream, If dream it was—a nightmare rather: first A stifling pressure compass'd in my heart; On my dull ears with thick and muffled peal Came many a sound of battle and of flight, Of tumult and distracted cries; my own, That would have been the loudest, was unheard, And seem'd to swell the chambers of my brain With volume vast of sound I could not utter. The screams of wounded horses, and the crash Of broken planks, and then the heavy plunge Of bodies in the water—they were loud, But yet the sound that was confined in me, Had it got utterance, would have drown'd them all! But still it grew and swell'd, and therewithal The burthen thickened on my heart; my blood, That had been flowing freshly from my wounds, Trickled, then clotted, and then flow'd no more: My horse upon the barrier of the bridge Stumbled; I started; and was wide awake. 'Twas an unpleasant dream. Van Ryk. It was, my Lord. I wonder how I mark'd not that you slept. Artevelde. I must be wakeful now. Who waits? who's there? [To an Attendant, who enters. The man I sent to Ypres with a letter— Has he return'd? Attendant. But now, my Lord, arrived. And with him Father John. Artevelde. Already he! With more alacrity he meets my wish Than I deserve. I'll see him now, at once. Attendant. He comes, my Lord. Artevelde. Then leave us—No, Van Ryk, Not you; or if you will, lie down within And rest you till I call. [Exeunt Van Ryk and the Attendant. Dreams are but dreams; And if they falsify the past, why think That they foreshow less falsely what's to come! Enter Father John. My honour'd friend, if welcomes ten times told Could carry more than one, I'd say the word As oft as you your Ave and your Creed. But welcome is enough. Father John. God's love, my son, Be with you alway. We have lately been In outward act more strangers than we were, But inwardly, I fain would hope, unchanged. Artevelde. Unchanged, upon my soul! The storms of State From time to time heave up some monstrous ridge Which each from other hides two friendly barks; Nought else divides us, and we steer, I trust, One course, are guided by one steadfast star, That so one anchorage we may reach at last. The cares and mighty troubles of the times Have kept me company and shut yours out. Father John. It is your place; the twitch of personal ties Ought not to move you; 'tis no blame of yours. But whence the present call? Artevelde. To that then straight. France is in arms; yon exile, once an Earl, From Hedin went by Arras to Bapaume On Wednesday se'nnight, if my scouts say true; And there my Lord of Burgundy he met, And with him made a covenant; from thence They came to Senlis, where the young King lies, And there the Dukes his uncles in his name Had gather'd from all parts a mighty force, Some eighty or a hundred thousand men. May that not startle me? Father John. 'Tis a large levy; But yet you muster more. Artevelde. Of men at arms Not half the tale; and those for Senlis bound Would double—so says fame—these now arrived. It were a vain and profitless attempt To disbelieve my danger, howsoe'er I show a careless countenance to the crowd. If Nicholas le Flamand call not back The French King's force, wherein I fear he'll fail, There's one sufficiency of aid can reach The measure of my need; one, only one; And that is aid from England. This not sent, Or else belated,—coming in the dusk And sunset of my fortunes,—where am I? Father John. At England's Council-board in Edward's days Sloth and delay had never seats; no missive Lay gathering dust and losing its fresh looks, No business lodged: would that it were so now! Yet surely if King Richard deem it meet And useful to his realm to send you aid 'Twill come with speed. Artevelde. He knows not that despatch Is now so all-important; nor from those I sent him will he learn it. I myself Thought not King Charles had sidled up so close, Else had I put your kindness then to proofs Which I intend it now,—else had I ask'd Your presence then in England. Father John. Nay, my son, Six have you sent already—on their way Our humble hospitality they shared At Ypres. Artevelde. Then their quality you saw. They were the best, methought, that I could spare For foreign service while thus press'd at home. The first for state and dignity was named; He whom Pope Urbayne, after Ghent rebell'd, Appointed Bishop to receive the dues Which else had fallen to Tournay's traitorous See, Where Clement is acknowledged; for this end Was he a Bishop made, and to say truth He's equal to his function. Next in rank Comes our sagacious friend John Sercolacke; None better and none safer in affairs, Were it but given to ponder and devise Beforehand what at every need to say; But should King Richard on the sudden ask What brought him there, confounded will he stand Till livelier tongues from emptier heads ring out, Then on the morrow to a tittle know What should have been his answer. Father John. Lois de Vaux And master Blondel-Vatre have glib tongues. Artevelde. Than Lois de Vaux there's no man sooner sees Whatever at a glance is visible; What is not, that he sees not, soon nor late. Quick-witted is he, versatile, seizing points, But never solving questions; vain he is— It is his pride to see things on all sides, Which best to do he sets them on their corners. Present before him arguments by scores Bearing diversely on the affair in hand, He'll see them all, successively, distinctly, Yet never two of them can see together, Or gather, blend, and balance what he sees To make up one account: a mind it is Accessible to reason's subtlest rays, And many enter there but none converge; It is an army with no general, An arch without a key-stone. Then the next, Good Martin Blondel-Vatre—he is rich In nothing else but difficulties and doubts: You shall be told the evil of your scheme, But not the scheme that's better; he forgets That policy, expecting not clear gain, Deals ever in alternatives; he's wise In negatives, is skilful to erase, Expert in stepping backwards, an adept At auguring eclipses; but admit His apprehensions and demand, what then? And you shall find you've turned the blank leaf over. Father John. Still three are left. Artevelde. Three names and nothing more. To please the towns that gave them birth they're sent, Not for their merits. Verily, Father John, I should not willingly disturb your peace, Or launch you on my fortune's troubled tide, But I am as a debtor against whom The writs are out—I'm driven upon my friends; Say, will you stead me? Father John. With my best of aid, Such as it may be. To King Richard's Court I will set forth to-morrow. Artevelde. Ever kind! Of all my friends the faithfullest as the first. Early to-morrow then we'll treat in full The matter of your mission. Now, good night. Father John. God's peace be with your slumbers. [Exit. Artevelde. In good time; Their hour is yet to come. What ho! Van Ryk! Enter Van Ryk. You're sure, Van Ryk, it has not yet transpired That I am in the camp? Van Ryk. Certain, my Lord. Artevelde. Then come with me; we'll cast a casual eye On them that keep the watch;—though, sooth to say, I wish my day's work over,—to forget This restless world and slumber like a babe; For I am very tired—yea, tired at heart. Van Ryk. Your spirits were wont to bear you freshlier up. If I might speak, my Lord, my humble mind, You have not, since your honour'd lady's death, In such a sovereignty possess'd yourself As you were wont to say that all men should. Your thoughts have been more inwardly let loose And led by fancies: should I be too bold And let my duty lag behind my love To put you thus in mind, forgive my fault. Artevelde. That was a loss, Van Ryk, that was a loss. The love betwixt us was not as the flush And momentary kindling in warm youth, But marriage and what term of time was given Brought it an hourly increase, stored for Heaven. Well—I am now the sport of circumstance, Driven from my anchorage;—yet deem not thou That I my soul surrender to the past In chains and bondage;—that it is not so, Bear witness for me long and busy days Which jostling and importunate affairs So push and elbow, they but seldom leave Shy midnight uninvaded. No, Van Ryk; At eve returning wearied to my tent, If sometimes I may seem to stray in thought, Seeking what is not there, the mood is brief, The operative function within call; Nor know I that for any little hour The weal of Flanders (if I may presume To hook it on my hours) is yielded up To vacant retrospect or idle thought. But now this body, exigent of rest, Will needs put in a claim. One round we'll take, And then to bed. Van Ryk. My Lord, you must be tired. I am too bold to trouble you so late With my unprofitable talk. Artevelde. Not so: Your talk is always welcome. There within You'll find a wardrobe, with some varlets' cloaks For use at need; take one about yourself And meet me with another at the gate. [Exit Van Ryk. A serviceable, faithful, thoughtful friend Is old Van Ryk,—a man of humble heart, And yet with faculties and gifts of sense Which place him justly on no lowly level— Why should I say a lowlier than mine own, Or otherwise than as an equal use him? That with familiarity respect Doth slacken, is a word of common use. I never found it so. ACT II. Scene I. —The interior of the State Pavilion.— Artevelde seated at the head of his Council, with Attendants. The French Herald and Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Artevelde rises to receive the Herald and reseats himself. Artevelde. France, I perceive, Sir Herald, owns at length The laws of polity and civil use, A recognition which I hardly hoped; For when the messenger that late I sent In amity, with friendly missives charged, Was sent to prison, I deem'd some barbarous tribe That knew no usages of Christian lands Had dispossess'd you and usurp'd the realm. Sir Fleureant. My Lord, you have your messenger again. Artevelde. Ay, Sir, but not through courtesy, I think, Nor yet through love. [To the Herald. Sir, you have leave to speak. Herald. My Lord, I humbly thank you. I entreat That in my speech should aught offend your ears You from the utterer will remove the fault. My office I obey and not my will, Nor is a word that I'm to speak mine own. Artevelde. Sir, nothing you can say shall be so gross, Offensive, or unmannerly conceived, As that it shall not credibly appear To come from them that sent you; speak it out. Herald. Philip of Artevelde, sole son of Jacques, Maltster and brewer in the town of Ghent, The realm of France this unto thee delivers: That forasmuch as thou, a liegeman born To the Earl of Flanders, hast rebelled against him, And with thy manifold treasons and contempts Of duty and allegiance, hast drawn in By twenties and by forties his good towns To rise in fury and forget themselves,— Thus saith the puissant and mighty Lord, The Earl's affectionate kinsman, Charles of France: Thou from before this town of Oudenarde With all thy host shalt vanish like a mist; Thou shalt surrender to their rightful Lord The towns of Ghent, and Ypres, Cassel, Bruges, Of Harlebeque, Poperinguen, Dendermonde, Alost and Grammont; and with them all towns Of lesser name, all castles and strong houses, Shalt thou deliver up before the Feast Of Corpus Christi coming, which undone, He the said puissant King, Sir Charles of France, With all attendance of his chivalry, Will raise his banner and his kingdom's force, And scattering that vile people which thou lead'st, Will hang thee on a tree, and nail thy head Over the gates of Ghent, the mother of ill That spawn'd thee;—and for these and sundry more Just reasons and sufficient, thou art warn'd To make thy peace betimes, and so God keep thee! Artevelde. Sir Herald, thou hast well discharged thyself Of an ill function. Take these links of gold, And with the company of words I give thee Back to the braggart King from whom thou cam'st. First of my father:—had he lived to know His glories, deeds, and dignities postponed To names of Barons, Earls, and Counts (that here Are to men's ears importunately common As chimes to dwellers in the market-place), He with a silent and a bitter mirth Had listen'd to the boast: may he his son Pardon for in comparison setting forth With his the name of this disconsolate Earl. How stand they in the title-deeds of fame? What hold and heritage in distant times Doth each enjoy—what posthumous possession? The dusty chronicler with painful search, Long fingering forgotten scrolls, indites That Louis Mâle was sometime Earl of Flanders, That Louis Mâle his sometime earldom lost Through wrongs by him committed, that he lived An outcast long in dole not undeserved, And died dependent: there the history ends, And who of them that hear it wastes a thought On the unfriended fate of Louis Mâle? But turn the page and look we for the tale Of Artevelde's renown. What man was this? He humbly born, he highly gifted, rose, By steps of various enterprise, by skill, By native vigour, to wide sway, and took What his vain rival having could not keep. His glory shall not cease though cloth of gold Wrap him no more; for not of golden cloth Nor fur nor minever his greatness came, Whose fortunes were inborn: strip me the two, This were the humblest, that the noblest, beggar That ever braved a storm! Sir Fleureant. Your pardon, Sir: Nothing was utter'd in disparagement Of your famed father; though a longer life And better would he assuredly have lived Had it seem'd good to him to follow forth His former craft, nor turn aside to brew These frothy insurrections. Artevelde. Sir, your back Shows me no tabard nor a sign beside Denoting what your office is that asks A hearing in this presence; nor know I yet By what so friendly fortune I am graced With your good company and gentle speech. But we are here no niggards of respect To merit's unauthenticated forms, And therefore do I answer you, and thus:— You speak of insurrections: bear in mind Against what rule my father and myself Have been insurgent: whom did we supplant?— There was a time, so ancient records tell, There were communities, scarce known by name In these degenerate days, but once far-famed, Where liberty and justice hand in hand Order'd the common weal; where great men grew Up to their natural eminence, and none Saving the wise, just, eloquent, were great; Where power was of God's gift to whom he gave Supremacy of merit, the sole means And broad highway to power, that ever then Was meritoriously administer'd, Whilst all its instruments from first to last, The tools of State for service high or low, Were chosen for their aptness to those ends Which virtue meditates. To shake the ground Deep-founded whereupon this structure stood, Was verily a crime; a treason it was Conspiracies to hatch against this State And its free innocence. But now, I ask, Where is there on God's earth that polity Which it is not, by consequence converse, A treason against Nature to uphold? Whom may we now call free? whom great? whom wise? Whom innocent?—the free are only they Whom power makes free to execute all ills Their hearts imagine; they alone are great Whose passions nurse them from their cradles up In luxury and lewdness,—whom to see Is to despise, whose aspects put to scorn Their station's eminence; the wise are they Who wait obscurely till the bolts of Heaven Shall break upon the land and give them light Whereby to walk; the innocent,—alas! Poor Innocency lies where four roads meet, A stone upon her head, a stake driven through her, For who is innocent that cares to live? The hand of Power doth press the very life Of Innocency out! What then remains But in the cause of Nature to stand forth And turn this frame of things the right side up? For this the hour is come, the sword is drawn, And tell your masters vainly they resist. Nature, that slept beneath their poisonous drugs, Is up and stirring, and from north and south, From east and west, from England and from France. From Germany, and Flanders, and Navarre, Shall stand against them like a beast at bay. The blood that they have shed will hide no longer In the blood-sloken soil, but cries to Heaven. Their cruelties and wrongs against the poor Shall quicken into swarms of venomous snakes And hiss through all the earth, till o'er the earth, That ceases then from hissings and from groans, Rises the song—How are the mighty fallen! And by the peasant's hand! Low lie the proud! And smitten with the weapons of the poor— The blacksmith's hammer and the woodsman's axe: Their tale is told; and for that they were rich And robb'd the poor, and for that they were strong And scourged the weak, and for that they made laws Which turn'd the sweat of labour's brow to blood,— For these their sins the nations cast them out, The dunghills are their death-beds, and the stench From their uncover'd carrion steaming wide Turns in the nostrils of enfranchised man To a sweet savour. These things come to pass From small beginnings, because God is just. Sir Fleureant. Sir, you are bold in prophecy, but words Will not demolish kingdoms. This alone Is clear, that we are charged to carry back A warlike answer. Artevelde. You have caught my sense. Let no more words be wasted. What I said Shall be engross'd and render'd to your hands To spare your memories. And so, farewell Unto your functions. For yourselves, I pray you To grace our table with your company At dinner time and taste of what we have. Rest you meantime. And you, my honour'd friends And Councillors, I bid you to the board. Adieu till then. Good Father, by your leave I will detain you. [The Council breaks up. The Herald and Sir Fleureant are conducted out, and only Artevelde and Father John remain. Did I say too much? What think you? Was I rash? Father John. My son, my son! You've spoken some irrevocable words, And more, in my weak judgment, than were wise. Till now might accident have open'd out A way to concord. Casualties or care Might yet have counsell'd peace; and was it well To send this challenge? Artevelde. Judge me not unheard. We have been too successful to be safe In standing still. Things are too far afoot. Being so high as this, to be no higher Were presently to fall. France will not brook To see me as I am, though I should bear My honours ne'er so meekly. With bold words I magnify my strength,—perhaps may dim Their fire-new courage, their advance delay, And raise the spirits of my friends. Father John. My son, These are the after-thoughts that reason coins To justify excess and pay the debts Of passion's prodigality. Artevelde. Nay, nay! Something of passion may have mix'd with this, Good Father, but I lost not from my thoughts The policy I speak of. Father John. Might I use The liberty of former days to one That's since so much exalted, I would tell How it is said abroad that Artevelde Is not unalter'd since he rose to power; Is not unvisited of worldly pride And its attendant passions. Artevelde. Say they so! Well, if it be so, it is late to mend; For self-amendment is a work of time, And business will not wait. Such as I am For better or for worse the world must take me, For I must hasten on. Perhaps the state And royal splendour I affect is deem'd A proof of pride;—yet they that these contemn Know little of the springs that move mankind. 'Tis but a juvenile philosophy That strips itself and casts such things aside, Which, be they in themselves or vile or precious, Are means to govern. Or I'm deem'd morose, Severe, impatient of what hinders me: Yet think what manner of men are these I rule; What patience might have made of them, reflect. If I be stern or fierce, 'tis from strong need And strange provocatives. If (which I own not) I have drunk deeper of ambition's cup, Be it remembered that the cup of love Was wrested from my hand. Enough of this. Ambition has its uses in the scheme Of Providence, whose instrument I am To work some changes in the world or die. This coming of the French distrubs me much, And I could wish you gone. Father John. My horses wait And I am ready. I will bear in mind, With the best memory that my years permit, Your charges; and if nothing more remains, God's blessing on your enterprise and you! I go my way. Artevelde. So long as lies the Lis Between our hosts, I have the less to fear. Say to King Richard I shall strive to keep The passes of the Lis; and if his aid Find them unforced, his way to France is straight As that to Windsor. I shall guard the Lis With watch as circumspect as seamen keep When in the night the leeward breakers flash But if he linger and the Lis be forced, Tell him our days are number'd, and that three Shall close this contest. I am harping still On the same string; but you, my friend revered, Will pardon my solicitudes, and deem That they are for my cause and not myself. I keep you now no longer; fare you well, And may we meet again and meet in joy! God grant it! fare you well. Father John. To horse at once. Artevelde. Let me attend you. Scene II. —A Platform near Artevelde's Pavilion.— Van Muck is seated at some distance in the background. Enter Sir Fleureant and the Herald. Sir Fleureant. Then be it as I said; the sun shall set 'Twixt seven and eight; ere then I'll know my course; And if the Regent lend a willing ear To the Duke's message and this lady send Upon his summons, merrily we go Together, and who meets us on the road Shall say, “A goodly company, God bless them! A man, a woman, and a pursuivant.” But 'twill not be so. Herald. Let us hope it may. Sir Fleureant. Assure yourself 'twill otherwise befall. He will retain her, or herself hold back. Then shall it be your prudence to depart With your best speed, whilst I invent a cause For lingering. I will not understand, But spin the matter of my mission out Into such length as with that web to hide My underworkings. Be you gone yourself Fast as you may, and far, when this falls out; And you shall tell the Duke with what good-will I hazard in his service loss of all I have to lose,—my life. Herald. Loth should I be To leave you so; but rest assur'd the Duke Shall hear, as through a trumpet, of your zeal. Sir Fleureant. (discovering Van Muck) Whom have we here? a listener? God forbid! And yet he seems attentive, and his ears Are easy of approach; the cover'd way, Scarp, counterscarp, and parapet, is razed. Halloa, Sir, are you there! Give you good-day! What think you we were saying? Troubled times! Van Muck. Your pardon, Sir; I'm hard of hearing. Sir Fleureant. Oh! We well can pardon that. What, deaf—stone-deaf? Van Muck. No, Sir, thank God! no deafer than yourself, But slowish, Sir, of hearing. Sir Fleureant. What, snail-slow? Van Muck. No, Sir, no slower than another man, But not so quick of hearing, Sir, as some, Being a little deaf. Sir Fleureant. Content thee, friend; Thine ears are sharper than thine apprehension. But wherefore want they flaps? Who dock'd them thus? Van Muck. It is no trouble nor no loss to you, Whoever did it. Sir Fleureant. Pardon me, my friend, It troubles me and doth offend mine eyes To see thee lack those handles to thy head. Tell me who snipp'd them? Van Muck. 'Twas the Regent. Sir Fleureant. Ho! The Regent? [To the Herald.] Upon this I go to work. The Regent? and you wait upon him here? Van Muck. I wait to ask him for my company: I was the Captain of a company. Herald. What, took he thy command away besides? Van Muck. Yes, Sir. Herald. And wherefore? what was thine offence? Van Muck. I was a little master'd, Sir, with drink, The night we carried Yerken, and a maid That ran upon me, Sir, I know not how, Forswore herself and said I did her wrong. Sir Fleureant. Well? Van Muck. And 'twas this that lost me my command. Sir Fleureant. Impossible! I've done as much myself A thousand times. Van Muck. 'Twas nothing, Sir, but this. Sir Fleureant. Oh, monstrous! And what askest thou? Van Muck. What ask? I ask him to replace me, as I said. Sir Fleureant. And wilt thou ask him to replace thine ears? Van Muck. No, Sir. Sir Fleureant. Why not? for thou'lt succeed as soon. I've heard that never did he change his mind But once, since he was Regent; once he did; 'Twas when he kindly pardon'd Peter Shultz: He changed his mind and hung him. Van Muck. By St. Giles! I would not ask him if I knew for certain He would deny me. Sir Fleureant. What! deny thee? hang thee! Take service with another Lord—leave him; Thou hast been foully dealt with! Never hope To conquer pride with humbleness, but turn To them that will be proud to use thee well. I'll show thee many such; and to begin, Here is myself. What lack'st thou? Money? See— I am provided: hold me forth thy hand; The Regent left thee hands: was that his skill? The injury that disables is more wise Than that which stings: a hand he left to take— And here's to fill it; and a hand to strike— Look not amazed, I bid thee not do that; I ask thee but to take a missive hence As far as Bruges. Van Muck. Sir, I'll be bound to take it. Sir Fleureant. And are there many men besides thyself That have lost rank and service in the camp? Van Muck. It was but yesterday two constables Had their discharge. Sir Fleureant. And why were they dismiss'd? Van Muck. 'Twas by the Regent's order; 'twas, he said, Because they made more riots in the camp Than they prevented. Sir Fleureant. He is hard to please. What are they call'd? Van Muck. Jock Bulsen and Carl Kortz. [Trumpets are heard at a little distance. Herald. Hark to the Regent's trumpets. Sir Fleureant. Thou must go. But name a place of meeting. Van Muck. The west dyke Behind the sutler Merlick's tent. Sir Fleureant. Do thou, And Kortz, and Bulsen, at the hour of nine, Be there to take my orders. Get thee gone, And be not seen till then. Go this way out, That so the Regent meet thee not. [Exit Van Muck. That seed Is sown, but whether I shall reap the fruits Is yet in Artevelde's arbitrement; Let him comply, and those three hens shall meet To hatch an addle egg. Herald. 'Tis more than time That I were fairly on the road to France. You're pushing on apace. Sir Fleureant. Our thrift lies there. Spare time, spend gold, and so you win the day! “For strongest castle, tower and town, The golden bullet beateth down!” Trumpets again. Enter Artevelde. Artevelde. You are equipp'd, I see, for taking horse: I pray you have Sir Charles of France inform'd It was your diligence despatch'd you thus, And not my lack of hospitality. Herald. My Lord, we surely shall report in France We were entreated bounteously and well. Thankfully now, my Lord, I take my leave: Sir Fleureant follows, and ere night will reach The hostel where we rest. [Exit Herald. Artevelde. What! in such haste? Sir Fleureant. My Lord, not many hours I stay behind, And not for idleness. My Lord, I'm charged With a strange mission, as to you 'twill seem, But to his Grace of Bourbon full of pith. Artevelde. Sir, I attend; his Grace has all my ears. What would he? Sir Fleureant. He has voices more than ten In the King's Council, and as they may speak Touching this war, 'twill likely be resolved. Now he is not implacably, as some, Envenom'd, and if justice were but done him He might be pacified and turn the course Of these precipitate counsels. Artevelde. On my soul, If there be justice I can render him He should receive it from my ready hands Although his voice in Council were as small As a dog-whistle. What may be his grief? Sir Fleureant. My Lord, he sent you letters that portray'd His grief in all its blackness. To be short, He wants his paramour; the damsel fair Whom you surprised, sojourning at the Court Of Louis Mâle, the day that Bruges was lost. Artevelde. Sir, he's thrice welcome to his paramour. I never have withheld her. Sir Fleureant. Then to me, A servant of the Prince, 'tis his desire She be consign'd to take her to the palace At Senlis. Artevelde. To the hands of whom she will I yield the lady, to go where she will, Were it to the palace of the Prince of Darkness. But at the lady's bidding it must be, Not at the Prince's. Sir Fleureant. Do I learn from this The lady is reluctant? Artevelde. By no means. The dangers of the journey kept her back From taking my safe-conduct heretofore, When, at the instance of the Duke your friend, I offer'd it; but having come thus far Toward the frontier, she may travel hence In your protection safely. Sir Fleureant. May I learn Her pleasure from herself? Artevelde. 'Twere best you did; And I will be your usher if I may. Attendance here! Enter an Attendant. Apprise the foreign lady That with her leave, and when her leisure serves, I will entreat admittance for some words Of brief discourse. [Exit Attendant. We'll walk towards her tent, If that's your pleasure. Sir Fleureant. Still at your command. Scene III. —A Pavilion richly hung and furnished. Elena and her Attendant Cecile. Elena. Art thou not weary of the camp, Cecile? Cecile. Oh no, my Lady, 'tis a stirring life; There is good sport upon the market-days And women are much made of. Elena. Well, I am. Or rather, I am weary of myself, And carry dulness with me as the wind Carries the cloud, and whereso'er I go An atmosphere of darkness and of storm Girdles me round. I wish that I were dead. Cecile. For shame, my Lady! you that are so young And beautiful, with all the world your own: It is a sin to be so discontent. Elena. Give me my lute, and I will answer that. (She sings.) Down lay in a nook my Lady's brach And said, “My feet are sore, I cannot follow with the pack A-hunting of the boar. “And though the horn sounds never so clear With the hounds in loud uproar, Yet I must stop and lie down here Because my feet are sore.” The huntsman when he heard the same, What answer did he give? “The dog that's lame is much to blame, He is not fit to live.” Enter an Attendant. Attendant. The Regent, Madam, would attend you here For some few moments' conference apart, If it might please you to admit him. Elena. Say, I wait upon his pleasure. [Exit Attendant. How is this? What can he want! he never ask'd before To speak with me in private. It is strange; But it will end in nothing. Go, Cecile. Stop; I've forgotten how my hair was dress'd This morning; put it right. Look, here he comes; But there's one with him—said he not apart He wish'd to see me? I will go within And thou canst say that I expect him there. [Exit. Enter Artevelde and Sir Fleureant. Cecile. My Lady waits your pleasure, Sir, within. [Artevelde passes into the inner apartment. Your servant, Sir; would you too see my mistress? Sir Fleureant. If it so please your master. Cecile. Who is he? Sir Fleureant. Your pardon, is it not the Regent? Cecile. No, The Regent is no master, Sir, of mine. Sir Fleureant. No? Cecile. By no means. Sir Fleureant. But he is often here? Cecile. No oftener than it pleases him to come And her to see him. Sir Fleureant. Which is twice a-day. Cecile. Who told you that? Sir Fleureant. A Cupid that brake loose From the close service he was sent upon, Which was to watch their meetings. Cecile. Said he so? A runaway, then, told a fool a lie. Sir Fleureant. Nay, but he had it from yourself. Cecile. If so He gave it out, this was the great horse-lie Made for the other to mount. Sir Fleureant. Come, then, the truth? Cecile. The well is not so deep but you may see it. The Regent sometimes at the close of day Has fits of lowness and is wearied much With galloping so long from post to post; And then my Lady has the voice of a bird Which entertains his ears. Sir Fleureant. The live-long night? Cecile. An hour or two, no more. Sir Fleureant. Which being past— Cecile. Which being past, he wishes her good rest, And so departs. Sir Fleureant. And all the while he's there Are you there too? Cecile. Never an instant gone. Sir Fleureant. Will you swear that? Cecile. Assuredly I will. Sir Fleureant. Or anything beside. Cecile. Your pardon, Sir; I would not swear that you had learnt good manners; That you'd been whipp'd as often as need was In breeding of you up, I would not swear; I would not swear that what you wanted then Has not been since made good; I would not swear— Sir Fleureant. Quarter, quarter!—truce to your would-not swearing! Here is the Regent. Enter Artevelde with Elena. Artevelde. Sir Fleureant, I have pled in your behalf And gain'd you audience; for the rest your trust Is in your eloquence. Sir Fleureant. Alas! my Lord, In nothing better? I had placed my trust, Not in the eloquence of rugged man, But woman's fair fidelity. Elena. Sir Knight, I will not task your tongue for eloquence Though it be ne'er so ready. Artevelde. I am here But an intruder. I will say no more; Save that the lady's choice, be what it may, Commands my utmost means and best good-will. [Exit. Elena. Stay, stay, Cecile; you will attend me here. You come, Sir, from his Grace of Bourbon. Why, And with what message, I can partly guess From what the Regent spake. The Duke's desire Is that I join him presently in France. Sir Fleureant. Such is his—what?—his madness had I said Before I saw you,—but I call it now Only his bitter fate, that nothing gay In palaces or courts can win him off From thoughts of you, that nothing high or great In policy or war can move him more, Nothing which fame awaits, ambition woos, Whilst you are absent can so much as twitch The hem or border of his soul. Elena. Indeed! I'm sorry if my absence vex the Duke; Sorry if it offend him. Sir Fleureant. Tis a grief More cutting as anticipated less; For though the tie had not the Church's stamp, He had not deem'd it therefore less secure. Such faith was his in what he thought was faith In her he lov'd, that all the world's traditions Of woman's hollow words and treacherous wiles Could not unfix him from his fast belief. Moreover, he has proffer'd deeds of gift As ample as the dowry of a duchess Would you but meet his wishes and return But for a day; and should you find thenceforth Just cause of discontent, with this rich freight Might you depart at will. Elena. The Duke, I own, Has been most liberal of his proffer'd bribes, And I have said I'm sorry to fall out With what his Grace desires:—that is not all— His Grace has been as liberal of reproaches; But what, then, is his grief? Alas! alas! The world's traditions may be true that speak Of woman's infidelities and wiles, But truer far that scripture is which saith “Put not your trust in princes.” Sir Fleureant. This is strange And would amaze him much. In what, I pray, Has he deceived you? Elena. Men, Sir, think it little; Tis less than little in a prince's judgment; In woman's estimation it is much. Sir Fleureant. But say what is it? Let him know his fault. Elena. So I design:—this tell the Duke from me:— I could have loved him once—not with the heat Of that affection which himself conceived— (For this poor heart had prodigally spent Its fund of youthful passion ere we met)— But with a reasonably warm regard. This could I have bestow'd for many a year, And did bestow at first, and all went well. But soon the venomous world wherein we lived Assail'd the Prince with jocular remark And question keen, importing that his soul Was yoked in soft subjection to a woman; And were she of good life and conversation, Insidious slanderers said, 'twere not so strange, But he is vanquish'd by his paramour! So the word went, and as it reach'd his ear From time to time repeated, he grew cold, Captious, suspicious, full of taunts and slights, Asserting his supremacy in words Of needless contradiction. This I bore, Though not by such sad change unalienate; But presently there came to me reports, Authentic though malignant, of loose gibes Let fall among his retinue, whereby His Grace, to keep his wit in good repute For shrewdness and to boast his liberty, Had shamefully belied his own belief— For firm belief he had—that I was chaste. Sir Fleureant. Oh mischief! you gave credence to such tales? Elena. This which I speak of, carry to the Duke; 'Tis therefore I relate it—he well knows If it be true or false. Say further this: Finding his Grace thus pitiably weak, Alternate slave of vanity and love, I from that moment in my heart resolved To break the link that bound us: to this end I parted from his company at Bruges, And by the same abiding, I have made This free deliverance of my mind to you. Which task fulfill'd (I'm sorry from my soul If it offend), I wish you, Sir, farewell. [Exit, Cecile following. Sir Fleureant. 'Tis a magnanimous harlot! By my faith, Of all the queans that on my humble head Have pour'd the vials of their wrath and scorn This is the prettiest, and, I think, the proudest. If one might bolt the bran from her discourse I should take leave to guess her firm resolve Was not fast clench'd till Artevelde took Bruges. Howe'er that be, my path, albeit self-sought, Is slippery. Sir Fleureant, my good friend, I bid thee, as thou lov'st thyself, take heed. ACT III. Scene I. —Night. A Dingle in the outskirts of the Camp behind a Sutler's Tent. Van Kortz, to whom enter Van Muck. Van Kortz. Who's there—Van Muck? halloa, you, boy! what speed? Van Muck. Hush, hush! speak low; is no one here but you? Van Kortz. No jolly soul beside. Van Muck. Has the watch past? Van Kortz. By my permission, yes. I drew a shaft Chock to the steel, and from behind this tree Aim'd it at Serjeant Laubscher's black old heart In quittance of a debt I've owed him long; But, pooh! I let him pass. Van Muck. Why, were you mad? It would have baulk'd our meeting. Van Kortz. What care I? Van Muck. It is a matter of five hundred marks, White money down. Van Kortz. Ay, let me see it down And I'll believe you. Van Muck. He will soon be here, And then you'll—here he is——no, 'tis but Bulsen. Enter Jock Bulsen. Bulsen. Well, is all right? 'tis close upon the hour. Van Kortz. Nothing is stirring. Forth from the trees —stand forth That he may see us, lest he miss the spot. Art certain that he'll bring the money? Van Muck. Yes, I saw it in his hands. Van Kortz. Why, hark ye then— What need to go elsewhere for gold that's here? Van Muck. He gives it us for taking letters hence To Ghent and Bruges and Yypres. Van Kortz. Hold thy peace Thou nick-ear'd lubber; what have we to do With whys and wherefores? Here he brings the gold; And hence he takes it not, if we be men. What say ye? Bulsen. Cut his throat. Van Muck. How now! how now! I would not for the world. Van Kortz. Pluck up thy heart. Hast courage but for half a sin? As good To eat the Devil as the broth he's boil'd in. Van Muck. What would ye do? for mercy's sake for bear! 'Twas I that brought him here, and God He knows I did not go about to take his life. Van Kortz. Why, go thy way then; two like me and Jock Are men enough. Bulsen. Enough to win the spoil, And by that token, friend, to share it too. Van Kortz. Go to the Devil with thy dolorous cheer; There is no manhood in thee. Get thee gone, Or I shall try six inches of my knife On thine own inmeats first. Bulsen. Thou'dst best begone; Thou art but in the way. Van Kortz. Go, pudding-heart! Take thy huge offal and white liver hence, Or in a twinkling of this true-blue steel I shall be butching thee from nape to rump. Bulsen. Go thou thy ways, and thank thy prosperous stars Thou art let live. Van Muck. I am rewarded well For bringing this about! but ye shall see If it be better for you. Bulsen. Hold, come back— What, fast and loose—is that your game?—soho! I see him coming. Sir Fleureant (without). Soft! was that the tent He spoke of? surely then—or—nay, I know not— Where am I going? Van Kortz. Come along, Sir, come— Where art thou going?—I will tell thee where— Going to grass, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée, With thy teeth upward—may that serve thy turn? Holloa, then, come along! Bulsen. Beware, beware! Thou art the noisiest cut-throat of them all; Will nothing stop thy tongue? This way, Sir, here. Enter Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Van Muck (passing between Sir Fleureant and the others.) Your sword, Sir Fleureant! stand upon your guard; We are not safe—there oft are men about At such dark hours as this that lie in wait— Look to your guard—but we shall be a match For more than one such! Bulsen. Never fear, Van Muck; If any such should break upon us here We'd parley with them first and see what good Might come of fighting or of speaking fair. Sir Fleureant. Where is the danger? you are dreaming, friends! Let me explain the matter I've in hand. Van Kortz. Come, come, Sir Hurly-Burly! where's your metal? Write us the matter down in yellow and white. No danger! but there shall be danger. Come, Out with this money! What if the Regent knew! Are men like us to be entrapp'd and sold And see no money down, Sir Hurly-Burly? We're vile crossbow-men and a knight are you, But steel is steel and flesh is still but flesh, So let us see your chinkers. Sir Fleureant (to Van Muck) Sure he's drunk! Why brought you me a drunken knave like this? Van Muck. He is not drunk, Sir; better that he were; If they are for foul play, so am not I, Nor did I mean it. Sir Fleureant. Ay, is that their game? Sirs, ye mistook our honest friend Van Muck! I could not in hard money bring you here More than a moiety of the sums you'll earn By carrying of my letters; it is thus So much I'll pay you now, and as much more You will receive in France from Hetz St. Croix, King Charles's master of accompt. The King Gave order for the payments. Bulsen. It is well; We will convey your letters, Sir, with speed. Van Kortz. We'll trust to meet you afterward at Court To see us justly paid. Sir Fleureant. Inquire for me When you arrive at Senlis or at Lisle, Or wheresoe'er the Court may then abide. Here are the letters and the skins of gold I give with each. The word is now “Despatch!” Speak not, nor eat nor drink with friend or foe, But each man take his wallet on his back And steal away. No lack of Frenchmen's friends You'll find at Bruges or Ypres. Who they are These letters will inform you: and at Ghent Though France may find less favour with the herd, Still are there some that will befriend you. Hence! What noise is that? Van Muck. The second watch. Sir Fleureant. Away! [Exeunt Van Muck, Kortz, and Bulsen. Now if one miscreant of the three play false, A potsherd squares the value of this head. Speed is my best safe-conduct, then, to France. Scene II. —The Pavilion, as in Scene III. of Act II. Artevelde and Elena. Cecile attending in the background. Elena. On your way hither, then, you passed through Ghent, The city which you saved. How sweet a joy Revisiting a place which owes to you All that it hath of glory or of ease! Artevelde. Truly it should have overjoy'd me; yes; How diverse, how contrarious is man! I know not wherefore, but I scarce was pleased To see that town now wallowing in wealth, Which last I saw—and saw with hearty courage— Pinch'd like a beggar wintering at death's door. Now, both the mart was full and church; road, bridge, River, and street, were populous and busy, And money-bags were toss'd from hand to hand Of men more thriftless than a miser's heir. I liked it not; my task, it seem'd, was done; The arrow sped, the bow unbent, the cord Soundless and slack. I came away ill-pleased. Elena. Perhaps you suffer'd losses in the siege? Artevelde. Not in the siege; but I have suffer'd something. There is a gate in Ghent—I pass'd beside it— A threshold there, worn of my frequent feet, Which I shall cross no more. But wherefore thus Divert me from my drift? Look round; look on; Think once again upon the proffer'd choice Of French protection. Though my army wear This hour an aspect of security A battle must be fought ere long. Elena. My Lord, You have been very kind to me. Oh, yes! And in your nature's bounty and its wealth, Despite those ineradicable stains That streak my life, have used me with respect. I will not quit your camp,—unless you wish it. Artevelde. Am I in life's embellishments so rich, In pleasures so redundant, as to wish The chiefest one away? No, fairest friend; Mine eyes have travell'd this horizon round Ending where they began, and they have roved The boundless empyrean up and down, And 'mid the undistinguish'd tumbling host Of the black clouds, have lighted on a soft And solitary spot of azure sky Whereon they love to dwell. The clouds close in And soon may shut it from my searching sight; But let me still behold it whilst I may. Elena. You are so busy all day long, I fear'd A woman's company and trifling talk Would only importune you. Artevelde. Think not so; The sweets of converse and society Are sweetest when they're snatch'd; the often-comer, The boon companion of a thousand feasts, Whose eye has grown familiar with the fair, Whose tutor'd tongue by practice perfect made Is tamely talkative,—he never knows That truest, rarest light of social joy Which gleams upon the man of many cares. Elena. It is not every one could push aside A country's weight so lightly. Artevelde. By your leave There are but few that on so grave a theme Continuously could ponder unrelieved. The heart of man, walk it which way it will, Sequester'd or frequented, smooth or rough, Down the deep valley amongst tinkling flocks, Or 'mid the clang of trumpets and the march Of clattering ordnance, still must have its halt, Its hour of truce, its instant of repose, Its inn of rest; and craving still must seek The food of its affections, still must slake Its constant thirst of what is fresh and pure And pleasant to behold. Elena. To you that thirst, Despite inebriating draughts of glory, Despite ambition, power and strife, remains; But great men mostly lose the taste of joy Save from such things as give their greatness growth: Which, spreading still, o'ershadows more and more Of less enjoyments, until all are sunk In business of the State. Artevelde. 'Tis otherwise, And ever was with me. It was not meant By Him who on the back the burthen bound That cares, though public, critical and grave, Should so encase us and encrust, as shuts The gate on what is beautiful below And clogs those entries of the soul of man Which lead the way to what he hath of Heaven: This was not meant and me may not befall Whilst thou remind'st me of those heavenly joys I once possess'd in peace. Life—life, my friend, May hold a not unornamented course Wherever it shall flow; be the bed rocky, Yet are there flowers, and none of brighter hue, That to the rock are native. War itself Deals in adornments, and the blade it wields Is curiously carved and gaily gilt. For me, let what is left of life, if brief, Be bright, and let me kindle all its fires; For I am as a rocket hurl'd on high, But a few moments seen of earthly eyes, Which ended, all is dark. Enter Cecile. Cecile. My Lady! oh! My Lord, my humble duty—Might I speak?— Artevelde. What hinders you, Cecile? Elena. Nay, ask not that; Nought ever did, my Lord, nor ever will; When she has breath you'll hear her. Cecile. Oh, my Lady! That frightful man I've told you of so oft That comes for ever with his vows of love And will not be denied,—I always said, “Begone! How dare you! Get you gone forsooth! To bring such tales to me!” But still he came, And now to-night— Artevelde. Who is it that she means? Elena. His name is—nay, God help my memory! What is his name, Cecile? Cecile. Van Kortz, my Lady. Artevelde. Not he that once was marshalsman? Cecile. The same. Artevelde. I know him well—his quality at least And his career I know. Right, right, Cecile; Deny him stoutly, for he means no good. Cecile. I did, my Lord,—I heartily denied him; I said I never would so much as touch him. I told him if he'd hang himself for love I'd love the rope that hang'd him,—nothing else. Artevelde. And yet he comes again? Cecile. Even now, my Lord, He came as though it were to wreak his spite, And show'd me bags of gold, and said that now He was so rich that he could wed a dame, Let pass a waiting wench, and from this time He'd mend his fortune, nor e'er look so low. I told him he might seek his fortune far Ere he should find his match for pride and greed; So with that word he set his spleen abroach And cursing all the camp, and most yourself, Swore he could buy and sell the best amongst you. Artevelde. What! said he so? and show'd you bags of gold? He has been selling something. Ho, Van Ryk! Van Ryk is waiting, no? Cecile. He is, my Lord. Enter Van Ryk. Artevelde. Van Ryk, a word: Thou know'st Van Kortz, the marshalsman that was— He parted hence but now, and I have cause To wish his person seized without delay And brought before me, with all scrips or scrolls That may be found upon him. Take my guard And see it done. [Exit Van Ryk. Elena. What is it you suspect? Artevelde. The gold is French. He has not lately had the means to thrive By Flemish gold. He was a man disgraced. Cecile. You're right, my Lord; 'twas not of guilders; no, 'Twas still of crowns and francs he talk'd. Elena. But whence Has he French gold? Artevelde. From him whom France sent here Doubtless to bring it,—from Sir Fleureant. Elena. Oh, surely, surely not,—a man who came With sacred mission charged, to seek for peace! It were but common honesty— Artevelde. My friend, Say in what time has honesty been common? Soft! silence, I beseech you; here's Van Ryk And he has found his man. Enter Van Ryk, with Van Kortz guarded. Whom hast thou there, Van Ryk, thus manacled, And what is his offence? Van Ryk. My Lord, Van Kortz. Artevelde. Van Kortz! The gudgeon whom Sir Fleureant hired To do French service, then betray'd to save His proper head! Down, Sir, upon thy knees, And tell what wiles the crafty Frenchman used To cheat thee of thy loyalty. Van Kortz (kneeling). My Lord, I tell the simple truth. Sir Fleureant sware The paper which he charged me with for Ghent Was for his private ends and nothing touch'd The faith I owed your Highness, and— Artevelde. Van Ryk, Bring me Sir Fleureant hither. Soft a while! What found you on Van Kortz? Van Ryk. This scroll, my Lord. Artevelde (reading the paper). “Worthy masters of Ghent,—this is to make it known unto you that we are hastily to come down into Flanders with a hundred thousand men, and with God's help to reseat our worthy cousin, Lois of Flanders, in his ancient estates and royalties, reducing to his obedience all that be rightfully bound thereunto and punishing the guilty. Wherefore we pray and counsel you, that at the receiving hereof, you return to your allegiance and send to us in our army the heads of these following: that is to say, Jacob Maurenbrecker, John Stotler, and Ralph of Kerdell; which done, we shall receive all others whatsoever to our friendship, and promise by these presents that none, saving these only, shall be called to answer what is past. “Written and sealed with the broad seal of France, in our host before Senlis, the 2nd day of October, in the year of grace 1382, by the King in his Council.” Stay, what is here? an afterthought of mischief:— “You are to know that we have sent the like letters patent to the good towns of Bruges and Ypres, to which lest they reach not, we pray you to convey the contents hereof.” Who are these other messengers? Van Kortz. My Lord Bulsen to Ypres and Van Muck to Bruges. They have set forth. Artevelde. Convey him hence to gaol. Let fifty men be mounted—some pursue Sir Fleureant of heurlée, some Van Muck, And others Bulsen on the roads to France, To Bruges, and Ypres;—for the head of each Proclaim a thousand florins;—haste, Van Ryk! [Exit Van Ryk, with Van Kortz guarded. Cecile. Oh Lord, the villain! and he came to me So proud and saucy! Truly it is said Give rope enough to rogues they'll hang themselves. Elena. And must he die, my Lord? Artevelde. What plea can save him? Cecile. That he should jeopardize his wilful head Only for spite at me! Elena. 'Tis strange! Artevelde. Not so; That Providence which makes the good take heed To safety and success, contrariwise Makes villains mostly reckless. Look on life And you shall see the crimes of blackest dye So clumsily committed, by such sots, So lost to thought, so scant of circumspection, As shall constrain you to pronounce that guilt Bedarkens and confounds the mind of man; Human intelligence on murders bent Becomes a midnight fumbler; human will, Of God abandon'd, in its web of snares Strangles its own intent. Elena. How fortunate Was this man's malice thus conceived to thee, My good Cecile! All woman as I am, I can forgive thy beauty that hath bred This love-engender'd hate. Cecile. I thank you, Madam. The scornful knave! to bring his gold to me That never would have looked upon him twice Though he'd been made of gold! Elena. How came you first To give him that authority and rank Which late you took away? Artevelde. Those are there here That hardly will be govern'd save by men Of fierce and forward natures. He was known For daring deeds from childhood; in his youth, Famed for his great desire of doing evil, He was elected into Testenoire's troop Of free companions: so in field or forest, Or in wall'd town by stipend lured, or vill Surprised and sack'd, by turns he lived at large, And learn'd the vice indigenous to each. Nought in dark corners of great cities done Of lewdness or of outrage, was unknown By him or unpartaken, nor the woods Lodged in their loneliest caves a beast so wild. Clashings of swords, groans, cries of murder, all Were to his ears indifferently common. Thus grown at length more reckless than was safe For his fraternity, they cast him off, And hanging loose upon the world what time My name was noised abroad, he join'd my camp. Enter Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Sir Fleureant. So, my Lord Regent! what is this I hear Blown through the camp with trumpets? what's my head That you should price it higher than the sum Of good repute for honour's laws observed Which you must part withal to take it? Much I've heard of dangers in the Holy Land Amongst the heathen, Jew or Turk or Moor, But never thought in Christendom to find Such bloody breach of hospitable laws! Artevelde. This is well spoken. Cecile. Oh, my Lord, for that, He's free enough. . . . . Elena. Cecile, be silent: peace. Artevelde. What you have here deliver'd, Sir, I say Hath been well spoken: it remains to ask If that which you have perpetrated here Hath been well done. Know you this writing? Sir Fleureant. Yes; I know it well; 'twas by the King my Liege Writ to the Mayor and citizens of Ghent. Artevelde. By you brought here; by you to one Van Kortz Deliver'd for despatch; by him to me, Upon his apprehension, yielded up. Such is the story of these scrolls and scrawls Which were to scribble out the loyalty Of three good towns, to undermine the faith Of my best friends; and having fouled and blurred The record of my glory in the page Of history past, blot it from that to come! This was a worthy business. Sir Fleureant. Ay, my Lord; Who shall gainsay the King of France his right To send what letters or what words he will To the good towns of Flanders? Artevelde. Let him try; And gainsay those that can my privilege To hang the bearers. Thou, Sir Fleureant, Hast by thy treachery betray'd thyself And unavoidably must suffer death. Thou cam'st a sharer in a herald's charge Ensuing peace; and, cloak'd in that disguise, With money for thy purposes provided, Thou hast bought treason. This may never pass; Else what security is mine that faith Is not put up to auction in my camp, Till each man sell his brother? Who provokes Treason in others, to a traitor's death Justly condemns himself. Such is thy lot: Yet do I rue the judgment I pronounce And wish it undeserved; for thou hast lit The darkness of thy indirect attempts With a more lively cheer and gallant mien Than most could brighten their best deeds withal. Sir, I am sorry for thee. Sir Fleureant. Spare your pity, And use your power. You see before you one Who would more willingly confront the worst Unpitying power inflicts than cry for mercy! I have been used to deem the loss of life But as a dead man's loss, that feels it not. Artevelde. Thou shalt do well of mortal life to think Thus lightly, and with serious thoughts prepare For that which is celestial and to come. 'Twixt this and daylight is thy leisure time For such purgation as thou need'st. Cecile, Send to St. Hubert's for some barefoot friar And bid him come so stored and with such speed As on a death-bed summons. [He steps to a door of the tent and calls some Soldiers of his guard. Cecile. Yes, my Lord, I'll go myself and say what duty calls him. Sir Fleureant. And prithee, wench, find me a merry friar, Who shall beguile the time. Cecile. A merry friar! Sir Fleureant. Ay, wench; if any in the camp there be They will be known to thee; a hearty man; For I have ever look'd on life and death, The world which is and that which is to be, With cheerful eyes, and hoped the best of both; And I would have Death's usher wear a smile As through to-night's rough road he shows the way. So send a merry friar. Elena. Oh, Sir Knight! If die you must so soon, for God's dear love Take thought for your immortal soul's behoof! Confess yourself and pass the night in prayer. Sir Fleureant. Confession will not hold us long; I'm young And have not yet had time enough to act Sins that are long in telling: [Then to Artevelde, who returns with two Soldiers of the Guard. You, my Lord, Cut short the catalogue betimes, I thank you. To you, sweet Lady, for your counsel kind And monitory speech, my last poor prayers I give,—more worth than thanks from dying men; And in your supplications of to-night When you lie down to rest, I humbly crave To be remember'd in return. Elena. Alas! Would I could stead you more than with the prayers Of such a sinful creature! Sir Fleureant. Lady, soon You'll need them for yourself. This fair array Of warlike multitudes you see around Will sunder and dissolve like wreaths of snow Pelted and riddled with the rains in March. Then should my Lord of Bourbon find you here, 'Twill be a rude rencounter; if at Bruges You found a lover in an enemy, The tables will be turned at Oudenarde, And in a lover shall you find a foe. I pray you think upon it. Artevelde. Fare thee well. These will conduct thee to thy place of rest, And all thy needs or wishes may require To make the night pass easily, supply. Again, Sir, fare thee well. Sir Fleureant. My Lord, farewell. I hardly know what words should thank your bounty That grants me everything—except my life. [Exit, guarded. Elena. O would, my Lord, that you could grant him that! He is a gallant gentleman. Artevelde. He's stricken; Which makes the meanest hold his courage high In presence of his Lady: not the less He is a brave and very noble knight, And nothing moves me in his favour more Than what he spake to you. I'm grieved, in truth, That stern necessity demands his death. No more of that. Turn we another leaf. The world declares us lovers, you have heard. Elena. My Lord? Artevelde. The world, when men and women meet, Is rich in sage remark, nor stints to strew With roses and with myrtle fields of death. Think you that they will grow? Elena. My Lord, your pardon; You speak in such enigmas, I am lost And cannot comprehend you. Artevelde. Do I so? That was not wont to be my fault. In truth There is a season when the plainest men Will cease to be plain-spoken; for their thoughts Plunge deep in labyrinths of flowers and thorns, And hardly to the light of day break through, Whilst much they wander darkling. Yet for once Let love be marshall'd by the name of love, To meet such entertainment as it may. Elena. I have been much unfortunate, my Lord; I would not love again. Artevelde. And so have I; Nor man nor woman more unfortunate As none more blessed in what was taken from him. Dearest Elena,—of the living dearest,— Let my misfortunes plead, and know their weight By knowing of the worth of what I lost. She was a creature framed by love divine For mortal love to muse a life away In pondering her perfections; so unmoved Amidst the world's contentions if they touched No vital chord nor troubled what she loved, Philosophy might look her in the face, And like a hermit stooping to the well That yields him sweet refreshment, might therein See but his own serenity reflected With a more heavenly tenderness of hue! Yet whilst the world's ambitious empty cares, Its small disquietudes and insect stings, Disturb'd her never, she was one made up Of feminine affections, and her life Was one full stream of love from fount to sea. These are but words. Elena. They're full of meaning. Artevelde. No, No, they mean nothing—that which they would speak Sinks into silence—'tis what none can know That knew not her—the silence of the grave— Whence could I call her radiant beauty back It could not come more savouring of Heaven Than it went hence; the tomb received her charms In their perfection, with nor trace of time Nor stain of sin upon them; only death Had turn'd them pale. Would you had seen her once, Living or dead! Elena. I wish I had, my Lord; I should have loved to look upon her much; For I can gaze on beauty all day long And think the all day long is but too short. Artevelde. She was so fair that in the angelic choir She will not need put on another shape Than that she bore on earth. Well, well, she's gone, And I have tamed my sorrow. Pain and grief Are transitory things no less than joy, And though they leave us not the men we were, Yet they do leave us. You behold me here A man bereaved, with something of a blight Upon the early blossoms of his life And its first verdure, having not the less A living root, and drawing from the earth Its vital juices, from the air its powers: And surely as man's health and strength are whole His appetites regerminate, his heart Re-opens, and his objects and desires Shoot up renew'd. What blank before me lay From what is said you partly may surmise; How I have hoped to fill it, may I tell? Elena. I fear, my Lord, that cannot be. Artevelde. Indeed! Then am I doubly hopeless. What is gone Nor plaints nor prayers nor yearnings of the soul Nor memory's tricks nor fancy's invocations— Though tears went with them frequent as the rain In dusk November, sighs more sadly breathed Than winter's whispering of the fallen leaf,— Can bring again: and should this living hope That like a violet from the other's grave Grew sweetly, in the tear-besprinkled soil Finding moist nourishment—this seedling sprung Where recent grief had like a ploughshare pass'd Through the soft soul and loosen'd its affections— Should this new-blossom'd hope be coldly nipp'd, Then were I desolate indeed! a man Whom heaven would wean from earth, and nothing leaves But cares and quarrels, trouble and distraction, The heavy burthens and the broils of life. Is such my doom? Nay, speak it, if it be. Elena. I said I fear'd another could not fill The place of her you lost, being so fair And perfect as you pictured her. Artevelde. 'Tis true; A perfect woman is not as a coin, Which being gone, its very duplicate Is counted in its place. Nature on you Hath stamped an impress—regal—but of hers Rather the contrast than the counterpart. Colour to wit—complexion; hers was light And gladdening; a roseate tincture shone Transparent in its place, her skin elsewhere White as the foam from which in happy hour Sprang the Thalassian Venus: yours is clear But bloodless, and though beautiful as night In cloudless ether clad, not frank as day: Such is the tinct of your diversity; Serenely radiant she, you darkly fair. Elena. Dark still has been the colour of my doom, And having not the brightness in my soul How should I wear the aspect? Artevelde. Wear it not; Wear only that of love. Elena. Of love? alas! That were to scatter this so mournful mist By calling up the hurricane. Time was, 'Tis true, that this foolhardy heart would brave, Yea madly court, an enterprise of passion, And like a witch would whistle for a whirlwind. May time not tame it? Is it wild as ever? And you too should have learnt what time and pain Can teach of wisdom. Artevelde. Brightly upon me Love breaks anew beneath the gathering clouds That roll around; and brightly upon you I see it break, but verily as you say, 'Tis with a stormy gleam; and looking forth, I ask myself, too late, what lot is this, What destiny that links you with a love Whose sunset is at hand, whose midnight lamp May chance be lighted at a funeral torch And show the way to Fate? Elena. What destiny? Think what you will, but think not that I fear To be your yokemate in calamity; Yes, or in death, should death be threaten'd; nay, What loftier fortune could a wild-flower find Than to be cast upon a noble corse? Oh God! that I were worthier!—that the joy, The greatness of the destiny, were deserved! But speak not now of darkness, death and night: Believe, as I believe, redeemed by you From all that Nature clothed me with of gloom, That many a sunrise shall be yours, and Hope, Rising with every sun, irradiate The long procession of the prosperous days, Triumphal, crowned with glory. Artevelde. Crowned with love. Give to this day, this sumptuous day, that crown; Let others run their course; give me this heart That beats itself to pieces. . . . . Elena. No, I cannot,— I cannot give you what you've had so long, Nor need I tell you what you know so well. I must be gone. Artevelde. Nay, sweetest, why these tears? Elena. No, let me go—I cannot tell—no—no— I want to be alone— Oh! Artevelde, for God's love, let me go! [Exit. Artevelde (after a pause). The night is far advanced upon the morrow, And but for that conglomerated mass Of cloud with ragged edges, like a mound Or black pine-forest on a mountain's top, Wherein the light lies ambush'd, dawn were near. Ay, truth to say, the night is sped and gone. Was it well spent? Successfully it was. And yet of springs and sources taking note How little flattering is a woman's love! Thrice gifted girl! The conqueror of the world In winning thee might deem he won a prize More precious far, yet count the prize he won As portion of his treasure, not his pride; For when was love the measure of desert? The few hours left are precious—Who is there? Ho! Nieuverkerchen!—when we think upon it How little flattering is a woman's love! Given commonly to whosoe'er is nearest And propp'd with most advantage; outward grace Nor inward light is needful; day by day Men wanting both are mated with the best And loftiest of God's feminine creation, Whose love takes no distinction but of sex And ridicules the very name of choice. Ho! Nieuverkerchen!—what, then, do we sleep? Are none of you awake?—and as for me, The world says Philip is a famous man— What is there women will not love, so taught? Ho! Ellert! by your leave though, you must wake. Enter an Officer. Have me a gallows built upon the mount And let Van Kortz be hung at break of day. No news of Bulsen or Van Muck? Officer. My Lord, Bulsen is taken; but Van Muck, we fear, Has got clear off. Artevelde. Let Bulsen, too, be hung At break of day. Let there be priests to shrive them. Who guards the Knight, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée? Officer. Sasbout, my Lord, and Tuning. Artevelde. Very well. Mount me a messenger; I shall have letters To send to Van den Bosch upon the Lis. Let Grebber wait upon me here. Go thou Upon thine errands. [Exit Officer.] —So,Van Muck escaped! And Ypres will receive its invitation. I think, then, Van den Bosch must spare a force To strengthen us at Ypres for a season. I'll send him orders. And Van Muck the traitor! Stupidity is seldom soundly honest; I should have known him better. Live and learn! Scene III. —The interior of a tent.—Sir Fleureant of Heurlée is seated at a table on which wine and refreshments are placed. Guards are seen without, walking backwards and forwards before the doors of the tent. Sir Fleureant. I oft before have clomb by rotten boughs To frail tree-tops; but this will be the last. Were it to do again, ten thousand Dukes With all their wealth of folly and want of wit Should tempt me not to such fool-hardihood. Here is the end of Fleureant of Heurlée! I know it; for my heart is dead already— An omen that did cross me ne'er before In any jeopardy of life. Cecile enters with a Friar. This wind Is cold, methinks, that comes through yonder door. I thought I had a cloak. Cecile. The Friar, Sir. Sir Fleureant. Well, this is strange; I surely had a cloak. Cecile. Sir, would you see the Friar? Sir Fleureant. Eh? what? who? Cecile. The Friar, Sir. Sir Fleureant. What Friar?—oh, your pardon! What? is it time? Friar. This wench, my son, brought word That you would fain confess yourself o'ernight And then make merry like a noble heart Till break of day that brings your latter end. Sir Fleureant. What is't o'clock? Cecile. I have not told the chimes Since midnight. Sir Fleureant. Yes, I wish'd myself confess'd; But, by your leave, not now!—my eyes are heavy And I was fain to wrap me in my cloak And lay me down to sleep as you came in. I think I had a cloak. Cecile. 'Tis here, Sir, here. Sir Fleureant. Ah, there it is. The air, I think, is sharp. Friar. 'Tis a cold air, my son, a cold and dry; But here's an element that's hot and moist To keep the other out. I drink your health. Sir Fleureant. My health! ha! ha! I'll lay me down and sleep, For I've a mortal weariness upon me. My body's or my soul's health do you drink? Friar. I drink, Sir, to your good repose. Sir Fleureant. I thank you; I shall sleep sound to-morrow. Cecile. Put this cushion Under your head. Sir Fleureant. Ah, you are kind, wench, now; You're not so saucy as you were. So,—there. Friar. And this I drink to your dear soul's salvation. Cecile. I'd tend you all night long with all my heart If it might do you good. Sir Fleureant. Good night, good night. Friar. What, does he sleep? Then sit you down, my maid, And quaff me off this flask of Malvoisie. Come sunrise and he'll lay his curly head Upon a harder pillow—So it is! “As a man lives so shall he die; As a tree falls so shall it lie.” Take off thy glass, my merry wench of all; Thou know'st the song that Jack the headsman sings— “'Tis never to snivel and grovel When a friend wants a turn of poor Jack's, But put him to bed with a shovel, Having cut off his head with an axe— Having Cut off his head with an axe.” Cecile. Be not so loud, good Friar, let him sleep. He'll pass the time more easy. Friar. Let him sleep! What hinders him to sleep?—not I, my lass; I've shriven many a sinner for the gallows; There's nothing wakes them but a lusty tug. I'd rather he should sleep than you, sweet wench; What, are you wakeful? Ah, you fat ribs! Ah! Cecile. Begone, you filthy Friar! At your tricks With here a dead man lying, one may say, Amongst one's feet! Friar. Who's dead, my merry soul? Not I, nor near it yet. Cecile. Out! ancient blotch! Enter Artevelde. Artevelde (stumbling against Sir Fleureant, who wakes and sits up). So, what is this? what wrangle ye about? What mak'st thou, Friar, with the wench? Friar. Who, I? Cecile. Ay, tell his Highness how you'd use a maid. Friar. Alack! we Churchmen, Sir, have much ado! We are but men, and women will be women. Fie, they are naughty jades!—sluts all! sluts all! Fie, how they steal upon our idle hours! Cecile. Thou liest, thou scandalous Friar— Artevelde. Soft, Cecile! Friar. Oh, she's a light-skirts!—yea, and at this present A little, as you see, concern'd with liquor. Cecile. A light-skirts! If it were not for thy cowl I have that lesson at my fingers' ends Should teach thee how to lay thy carrion's sins Upon a wholesome maid. Artevelde. Peace, peace, I say! I would discourse some matters with this Knight. Leave us together. Friar, go thy ways; Thy hands are not too clean. I know the wench; She would not tempt thee. Get thee gone, I say. Friar. My Lord, the peace of God be with your Grace, And with this Knight, and with that sinful woman. [Exit. Cecile. I thank your Highness—Oh the mouldy knave! I thank you, Sir. Good-even to your Grace. [Exit. Artevelde. Good-night, Cecile.—Sir, I disturb'd your rest; I saw not that you lay there. Sir Fleureant. Oh, my Lord, It matters not; to-morrow I shall lie Where you will not disturb me. Artevelde. So you think. Sir Fleureant. So you, my Lord, have said. Artevelde. You stand condemn'd; Yet 'tis a word that I would fain unsay. Sir Fleureant. You are most kind; the word was ever rife You were a merciful man and fearing God, And God is good to such and prospers them; And if my life it please you now to spare You may find mercy for yourself in straits According as you show it. Artevelde. Nay, thy life Is justly forfeited: which if I spare It is not that I look for God's reward In sparing crime; since justice is God's due. Thou hast an intercessor, to whose prayers I grant thy life, absolving thee not freely, But on conditions. Sir Fleureant. Whatsoe'er they be I will be bound by oath and honour's pledge Most faithfully to fulfil them. Artevelde. Well thou may'st. 'Tis but to pay thy debt of grateful care To her whose charity redeems thy life That I would bind thee. At the prayer much press'd Of thy Lord's sometime Lady thou art spared. Sir Fleureant. I'm bound to her for ever. Artevelde. Sometime hence Mischances may befall her. Though I trust, And with good reason, that my arms are proof, Yet is the tide of war unsteady still; And should my hope be wreck'd upon some reef Of adverse fortune, there is cause to fear Her former Lord, thy master, who suspects Uneasily her faith, in victory's pride Would give his vengeance and his jealousy Free way to her destruction. In such hour, Should it arrive, thou might'st befriend the Lady As in thy present peril she doth thee. Sir Fleureaint. I were ungrateful past all reach of words That speak of baseness and ingratitude Should I not hold my life and hand and heart Purely at her behest from this time forth. And truly in conjunctures such as those Your Highness hath foreseen, to aid her flight Were service which no Fleming could perform How true soe'er his heart, and yet to me It were an easy task. Artevelde. I trust the day Will never come that puts thy pledge to proof; But should it come, I charge thee on thy faith And duty as a Knight, be stout and true. Prudence, meantime, demands that thou remain In close confinement. Sir Fleureant. As you please, my Lord. Artevelde. (after a pause) What, watch there, ho! Enter two Guards. You will give passage to Sir Fleureant To go at large. My mind you see is changed; It ever was my way, and shall be still, When I do trust a man to trust him wholly. Thou shalt not quit my camp; but that word given, Thou art at large within it. Sir Fleureant. Sir, your trust Shall not appear misplaced. Artevelde. Give thee good rest! And better dreams than those I woke thee from. Sir Fleureant. With grateful heart I say, my Lord, God keep you! ACT IV. Scene I. —Ypres.—The Burgomaster of Ypres, with several Burghers of the French Faction, and Van Muck. Burgomaster. Well, well, God bless us! have a care—oh me! Be careful how thou speak'st; wear a white hat; And ever, mind'st thou, when thou see'st Vauclaire, Uncover and stand back. Van Muck. I will, your worship. Burgomaster. Nay, but thou must. And Roosdyk—speak him fair: For, give him but a saucy word, he's out, And twinkling me his dagger in the sun, Says, “take you that,” and thou art dead for good. Van Muck. I'll speak him fair. Burgomaster. Nay, but I say thou shalt. Tis a good rule to be more civil-spoken Than wantonly be cut and stabb'd for nothing. Van Muck. 'Tis so, your worship. Burgomaster. Cast not away thy life. Van Muck. 'Tis as your worship pleases. 1st Burgher. But if Vauclaire, or Roosdyk, on their rounds, Should ask him whence he comes or what's his craft, Being strange-looking for a citizen, What should he answer? Burgomaster. Say thou com'st from Dinand— From Dinand, say, to sell Dinandery, Pots, pitchers, mugs and beakers, and the like. Van Muck. Suppose I'm question'd where they are? Burgomaster. Thou'st sold 'em. Say thou thank'st God. Say thou'rt a thriving man. 1st Burgher. (aside to 2nd) This matter will be out. 2nd Burgher. Why so? 1st Burgher. Good friend, Did'st ever know a secret to lie close Under a goose's wing? 2nd Burgher. I think 'twill out. 'Twill surely out. 1st Burgher. The frighten'd fox sits fast; Folly with fear will flutter still and cackle. [Aloud.] This will be known. I am for rising now, Slaying Vauclaire and Roosdyk in their beds Before they nose it, sounding through the streets King Charles's pardon and the town's submission, And so to present issue with it all. Burgomaster. Mercy! what foolishness will young men talk! 1st Burgher. Under your favour—old men too at times. 3rd Burgher. De Vry, a word. I marvel at thy rashness; We are not ripe for action: in a week, Perchance a day,—nay, it may be this hour, Or Van den Bosch will conquer at Commines, Or the French force the passage. If the first, In vain were this revolt, for Van den Bosch Would quell us in a trice; and if the second, Then were the time to rise, for all the town Would then rise with us. 2nd Burgher. In good time, Verstolken; The axe's edge is turned toward us now, And what shall save us if this mooncalf here Should let his errand out? Van Muck. A mooncalf, I? I am an honest man; I dare you, Sir, To signify me other. 2nd Burgher. Hold thy peace. Whilst the French King is looked for at Commines Too wise is Van den Bosch to break his strength With sending soldiers hither. He but counts Nine thousand men. 4th Burgher. The double were too few To be divided. 5th Burgher. More than some two thousand Would hardly march on Ypres should we thrive, And if they did, what then? We'd bowl them down Like ninepins. 2nd Burgher. Nay, no fear of Van den Bosch; He'll never waste his forces upon us Whilst the French King's to come; and then the news Of Ypres fallen off will cheer the French, Sicken the White-Hoods, and make sure the loss Of that famed passage, which shall magnify Our merits with King Charles. Enter a Sixth Burgher. 6th Burgher. Away, away! Vauclaire has word of all you do; a troop Despatch'd by Van den Bosch to give him aid Is riding into town; Van Muck's commission Is whisper'd of, and loudly. Burgomaster. There now, there! I told you so—I told you this would come; But still you talk'd of rising. Run, Van Muck, Thou villain, run, and be not seen abroad With honest citizens. 2nd Burgher. Ay, get thee hence; Best quit the town and make thy way to France. Van Muck. I will, your worships. [Exit, but returns immediately. Please you, Sir, they come; The street is full of men-at-arms. Burgomaster. There—there! I said so; there! and still you hearken'd not! Oh Time and Tide! Oh wala-wa! Oh me! 3rd Burgher. What shall we do? 2nd Burgher. Van Muck, stand fast; they come: It is Vauclaire himself. Burgomaster. Say you sell pots. Enter Vauclaire and Roosdyk, followed by a troop of Men-at-Arms. Vauclaire. Ah, Master Burgomaster, here thou art! Roosdyk. Make fast the doors. Vauclaire. And thou, Verstolken—nay! Here's Goswin Hex, and Drimmelen, and Breero! And thou, De Vry—Van Rosendaal, and thou! How rare a thing is faith! Alas, my masters! Here is a work you put me to! Roosdyk. Stand forth, Master Van Muck! where art thou?—which is he? 3rd Burgher. What is it, Sirs, you charge us with? Roosdyk. What think ye? Say treason and I'll call you conjurors. Vauclaire. I have my orders—stand thou forth, Van Muck— Which I must needs obey. What art thou, say? Roosdyk. A villain. Van Muck. No, Sirs, I am not a villain; I am a travelling trader; I sell pots. Roosdyk. Thyself—a precious vessel!—that thou sell'st. Where is the Provost Marshal? Hark you, Sir! Put irons on them all, and give Van Muck A taste of what you have. Burgomaster. Hold off! what's this? I am your master. Roosdyk. Knock him on the head; Bid him be patient. Vauclaire. I am amazed at this! So sweetly as you all demean'd yourselves! A guileful world we live in! God forgive us! Make fast the gyves and take them off to gaol. Burgomaster. Sirs, hear me, oh! Roosdyk. Gag me this grey-beard! Burgomaster. Oh! 1st Burgher. Thank God! Vauclaire. The Stadt-house. You shall all be heard Except Van Muck, whose treason is too rank To be excused. My orders I obey; First to the rack they doom him, then to the block. Van Muck. Oh! mercy, Sirs; I'm not a traitor; no, I'll tell it all. Roosdyk. That shalt thou, or the rack Is not so good a singing-master now As it was wont to be. Van Muck. Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He is taken out. Vauclaire. Bring them away: the Stadt-house—hear them there, Each by himself. Bring them away at once; Keep them apart and let them not have speech One of another. Roosdyk. If any man make signs, Despatch him on the spot. Master Vauclaire, We follow you. Scene II. —The French Court at Arras.—An Antechamber in the Maison de Ville. Tristram of Lestovet, Clerk of the Council, and Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Sir Fleureant. When I forgive him, may the stars rain down And pierce me with ten thousand points of fire! His whore! his leman! Lestovet. Had she been his wife A small transgression might have pass'd. Learn thou To keep thy hands from meddling with men's whores; For dubious rights are jealously enforced, And what men keep for pleasure is more precious Than what need is they keep. Sir Fleureant. He'll be the worse, And knows it. When I fled I left behind A notion of my purpose. There's none here Can know like me his weakness and his strength. Let but the Council hear me, I shall tell What shall be worth to them ten thousand spears. Lestovet. 'Tis now their time; but youth lies long a-bed; The King is always tardy. Who comes here! My Lord of Burgundy, I think—yes, he. Enter Duke of Burgundy. Burgundy. Good-morrow, Sirs, good-morrow! So, your stars, They tell me, are your good friends still, good Flurry; You always come clear off;—well, I'm glad on't. Sir Fleureant. I give your Highness thanks. Burgundy. Well, Lestovet, My brother of Bourbon keeps his mind, they say; He is for Tournay still! 'tis wonderful, A man of sense to be so far astray! Lestovet. His Grace of Bourbon is misguided much; He is deluded by a sort of men That should know better. Burgundy. They shall rue it: Lo! To turn aside ten leagues, ten Flemish leagues, With sixty thousand men!—mad, plainly mad. Lestovet. Sir Fleureant here, who left the rebel camp No longer past than Wednesday, says their strength Lies wholly eastward of the Scheldt. Sir Fleureant. The towns Betwixt the Scheldt and Lis, your Grace should know, Are shaking to their steeple-tops with fear Of the French force; and westward of the Lis You need but blow a trumpet and the gates Of Ypres, Poperinguen, Rousselaere, And Ingelmunster, gape to take you in. Burgundy. They are my words, they are my very words; Twenty times over have I told him so. But he's as stubborn as a mule; and oh! That Constable! Oh, Oliver of Clisson! That such a man as thou, at such a time, Should hold the staff of Constable of France! Well! such men are! Lestovet. My Lord, forgive my zeal For so exorbitantly shooting past The line of duty as to tender words Of counsel to your Highness; but my thoughts Will out, and I have deem'd that with his Grace, Your royal brother, you have dealt too shortly; The noble frankness of your nature breaks Too suddenly upon the minds of men That love themselves and with a jealous love Are wedded to their will: not he alone, But others of the Council at his back Would on a gentler provocation yield That stiffen with a rougher. Burgundy. That may be; But, Lestovet, to sue to them to yield! I cannot do it. Lestovet. May it please your Grace To leave it in my hands. With easier ear They listen to a man of low condition; And under forms that in your Grace to use It were unseemly, I can oft approach, And with a current that themselves scarce see Can turn the tenour of their counsels. Burgundy. Nay; But how can I be absent from the board At such a time as this? Lestovet. A seizure, say, Of sudden illness. They'll be here anon;— I think I hear them now. Sir Fleureant. A sound, I think, Of horses' feet. Burgundy. Then try it, Lestovet; You are a wise and wary man; this day I leave the field to you; say that the gout Confines me to my chamber. Lestovet. Hark, my Lord, They come. Burgundy. Farewell to you; improve your time. [Exit. Lestovet. Ha! ha! the Council! they are mettlesome men. Arouse their passions, and they'll have opinions; Leave them but cool, they know not what to think. Sir Fleureant. You'll tell them I am here. Lestovet. Before they rise You shall be heard at large; but leave to me To choose the fitting moment. Hide without Until the Usher have a sign: the mace Shall trundle from the board, which he shall hear; Then come at once as one that from his horse Leaps down, and, reeking, hurries in to tell A tale that will not wait. Scene III. —The Council Chamber. The Chaplain to the Council and an Usher. Chaplain. Beasts of the People called in Holy Writ; Beasts of the People proved in France to-day. And such as we are leaving them in France In Flanders shall we find them. Is't not so? Usher. Yea, Sir; but not now first, or here or there. In France,—I think 'tis twenty years foregone,— When I was but a boy,—twenty and more,— That ramping to a Demon's trumpet-call The beasts of burthen changed to beasts of prey. Our Aubriot of to-day was Claremont then, And then in Flanders Philip's father ruled, As now the son. Chaplain. Worse villain of the two. And how comes he, not skilled nor bred to war, To deal such deadly strokes? I'll tell thee how: The father, knowing to what wicked work The babe was destined, at the Font of Grace Took order with a catamountain priest, A hungry priest whose mouth he filled, to leave (Oh! sacrilege, and horrible hell-born sin!) The right hand unbaptized. [A flourish of trumpets. Usher. Ho! there they come. Here is thy book—this door—just show thyself Before we go—if they but see thy back They are content and take their prayers as read. [Exeunt Chaplain and Usher. Enter the King, who is brought in by the Duke of Bourbon and seated on a Chair of State at the head of the Board; three seats are placed below, on two of which the Dukes of Bourbon and Berry place themselves. The other Councillors take their seats in succession to the number of twelve; to wit, Sir Oliver of Clisson, Constable of France; Sir John of Vien, Admiral of France; the Lord of Coucy, Sir William of Poictiers, Sir Aymenon of Pumiers, the Bastard of Langres, Sir Raoul of Raneval, and the Begue of Villaine. A desk is placed opposite the lower end of the Board, at which is seated Tristram of Lestovet, Clerk of the Council. Bourbon. My brother of Burgundy is sick to-day; And keeps his chamber, which the King permits, The King. We do. Bourbon. Save him, our number is complete. Sir Oliver of Clisson, unto thee, By virtue of thine office, appertains, More than to any here, to point the course Of the King's armies: wherefore he desires Thou open this day's business. The King. 'Tis our will. The Constable. May it please your Highness; and my good Lords, you! So much was said on Friday of the choice 'Twixt Lille and Tournay—that the more direct, And this, 'tis justly held, the safer road— That I should waste your patience and your time Did I detain you long. To Lille, my Lords, Were two days' journey; thence to Warneston Were one day, let or hindrance coming none; But should the rains continue and the Deule— The King. What ails my Lord of Burgundy, good uncle? Bourbon. The gout, sweet cousin. May it please your Grace To hearken to the Constable. The Constable. My Lords, If with these luckless rains the Deule be flooded As there is cause to think it is, at least From Armentières to Quesnoy, and the Marque Be also fuller than its wont, what days Should bring us to the Lis were hard to tell. But grant we reach so far, all over-pass'd Without mishap the waters in our way, The bridges on the upper Lis, we know, Are broken down, and on the further shore Lies Van den Bosch—and where are we to pass? I put it to you, where are we to pass? How do we cross the Lis? Saimpi. May it please your Grace, I would be bold to ask the Constable Hath not the Lis a source? Sanxere. Yea, one or more. Saimpi. Why then it may be cross'd. The Constable. My Lord of Saimpi, Surely it may be cross'd, if other ways Present no better hope. My Lords, ye all Have voices in the Council; speak your minds, And God forefend that any words of mine Should blind your better judgments. Pumiers. Higher up, A few leagues south, by Venay and St. Venant, The Lis is fordable and is not kept. Raneval. Not kept, my Lords! why should it? Van den Bosch Were doubtless overjoy'd to see us strike, Amidst the drenching of these torrents, deep Into the lands of Cassel and Vertus; An English force, for aught we know, the while Borne like a flock of wild geese o'er the seas And dropp'd at Dunkirk. On the left are they, The Flemings on the right, strong towns in front; And so we plunge from clammy slough to slough With fog and flood around us. Sanxere. Yea, wet-footed. Raneval. What say you? Sanxere. For the love of God, my Lords, Keep we dry feet. Rheumatic pains, catarrhs, And knotty squeezings of the inward man Thus may we fly the taste of. Raneval. Soft, Sir Lois; Spare us thy gibes; I've stood more winters' nights Above my knees in mire than thou hast hairs Upon the furnish'd outside of thy skull. Sanxere. I say, my Lords, take heed of mists and swamps; Eschew rain-water; think on winter nights; Beware the Flemish on the Lis; beware The English, that are in much strength—at London. You've brought the King to Arras in November, And now you find that in November, rain Is wont to fall; you find that fallen rain Swells rivers and makes floods; whereof advised, Take the King back with all convenient speed And shut him up at Senlis. The King. Hold, Sir Lois; I will not go. Sanxere. I crave your Grace's pardon; I little dream'd you would; you are a man. Raneval. Lois of Sanxere, I ask thee in this presence, Fling'st thou these girds at me? The Constable. My Lords, my Lords! I do beseech you to bethink yourselves. Remember where ye are. Raneval (drawing off his glove). Lois of Sanxere— [Here Tristram of Lestovet, in arranging some parchments, touches the mace, which rolls heavily from the table and falls close to the feet of Sir Raoul of Raneval. He starts up. Lestovet. Not hurt, my Lord, I hope? Thank God! thank God! Most humbly do I sue to you, my Lord, To grant me your forgiveness. Raneval. Nay, 'tis nought; It might have been a bruise, but—— Enter an Usher, followed by Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Usher. Please your Grace, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée waits without, Hot from the Flemish camp, which he but left Two days agone, and he can tell your Grace How all things stand in Flanders. Bourbon. Now we'll see; This is an apt arrival. Welcome, Sir! What is the news you bring us? Sir Fleureant. Please your Grace, The letters patent I sought means to send To Ghent and Bruges and Ypres; to the last Alone they found their way, although from thence Doubtless the terms have spread. The Regent, warn'd Of what was machinated, as I hear, Sent orders to the Lis for Van den Bosch To split his power, and throw a third to Ypres To fortify Vauclaire: whilst he stood fast, But held himself prepared, if Bruges should rise Or Ghent, to drop adown the Lis to Heule, Or Disselghem, or Rosebecque, there to join The Regent's force, that then should raise the siege Of Oudenarde, and gather on the Lis. Bourbon. These are good tidings; yet I deem the Lis Is still too strongly guarded for our force There to make way. The Constable. Your Grace is ever just In all your views. Villaine. Sir Constable, some thought Let us bestow on tidings whence we learn The fears o' the adverse and the slide this way Of Ypres, Ghent, and Bruges. Raneval. Should these towns turn, The Regent were constrain'd to keep i' the west A larger force and passing down the Scheldt By Tournay, we are less opposed. Sanxere. Not so. Raneval. I say we meet with opposition less Upon the Scheldt at Tournay. Sanxere. I say, no. Turning our faces from these doubting towns, What can they but fall back? Raneval. Wilt have it so? Methinks, my Lords, if turning and backsliding And lack of loyalty—— Lestovet (to Sir Fleureant). Hilloa, Sir, ho! You cannot go, you must not quit the board; My Lords will further question you anon. Spake you not of the Scheldt? doubtless my Lords Would hear you upon that. Bourbon. Ay, ay, the Scheldt; What say'st thou of the Scheldt? Sir Fleureant. My Lords, 'tis true With mine own eyes I have not view'd the Scheldt Higher than Oudenarde, yet what I know More sure than common rumour I may tell,— That reach by reach from Elsegem to Kam, At sundry stations, say Kerckhoven first, 'Twixt Berkhem and Avelghem, where the Ronne Its tide contributes elbowing Escanaffe, At Pontespiers and Pecq and divers points Betwixt them interposed, strong piles are driven Deep in the belly of the stream athwart. Thus neither up nor down can make their way Boat, raft, nor caravel. Langres. We see, my Lords, The Scheldt is no purveyor of our victual Should we proceed by Tournay. Saimpi. I surmise We shall find spears as thick upon the banks As stakes within the stream. Raneval. Then let us—Ha! Who is it now that flinches and postpones? I say, once pass'd the Scheldt, and better far We should confront the Flemish spears; so be it! We'd give the villains such a taste of France That thence for evermore “Mon Joye St. Denis” Should be a cry to make their life-blood freeze And teach rebellion duty. Sanxere. Fee, faw, fum! Lestovet. The Admiral would speak; the Admiral Hath not yet spoken. The Admiral. Here we lie, my Lords, At Arras still, disputing. I am a man Of little fruitfulness in words; the days That we lie here, my Lords, I deem ill spent. Once and again the time of year is told, That we are in November: whiles we vex This theme, what follow?—why, December? True, The time of year is late, my Lords; yea, truly, The fall of the year, I say, my Lords, November, Is a late season, when it rains, my Lords. I have not, as you know, the gift of speech, But thus much may a plain man say,—time flies; The English are a people deft, my Lords, And sudden in the crossing of the seas; And should we linger here with winter coming We were not call'd good men of war, forsooth. So truly, Sirs, my voice, with humbleness, Is for short counsel; in good truth, my Lords— The King. Dear uncle, what's o'clock? Bourbon. 'Tis noon, sweet cousin. The King. I want my dinner. Bourbon. Presently, fair cousin. Sanxere. Your Grace, I see, is of the Admiral's mind; You love short counsel; marry, and of mine; I love it too; more specially I love it With mallets at our backs and winter near. We talk so long that what is said at first What follows sponges from our memories. Pass to the vote, my Lords, nor waste your breath In further talk. Bourbon. Then pass we to the vote. The Constable. So be it; to the vote. Others. Agreed: to the vote. Lestovet. My Lords, may it please you, ere I take your votes, That briefly I rehearse what each hath said As noted with a hasty pen, or writ In a weak memory? Bourbon. So do, so do. Lestovet. First, my Lord Constable: he bade you think What length of way and waters lay between Ere you could reach the Lis; where when you come You find no bridge, and on the further bank The Flemish power: my Lord of Saimpi then Told of a passage nearer to the springs By Venay and St. Venant; whereunto My Lord of Raneval made answer meet That though the Lis were fordable above, Yet in the lands of Cassel and Vertus There dwelt a dangerous people, sulking boors, Who, when we straggled, as perforce we must, Through bye-ways sunder'd by the branching waters, Should fall upon us, founder'd in the sloughs, And raise the country round:—thus far, my Lords, Had you proceeded, when the tiding came Of Ypres, Ghent, and Bruges upon the turn, Repentant of their sins and looking back For their allegiance; with the sequel fair Of much diminish'd squadrons at Commines. Then though my Lord of Raneval spake well Of clearance on the Scheldt, through direful need That now must westward suck the Flemish force, Yet in abatement came the shrewd account Of how the Scheldt was grated, gagg'd, jaw-lock'd, With here a turnpike and with there a turnpike, And Friesland horses. Said the Knight of Langres, How shall our victual reach us? To which adds Sir Hugh of Saimpi, that the banks are kept; Whereat my Lord of Raneval rejoin'd That he, as best became him, took no heed, So it were soon, to whereabouts he faced The Flemish scum in arms, or on the Scheldt Or on the Lis— Raneval. Permit me, Sir, the Lis I spake not of. Lestovet. I humbly crave your pardon; My memory is but crazy, good my Lords: It oft betrays me vilely. Sir Raoul, I do beseech you pardon me; I deemed (Misled perchance by that so rife renown Which plants you ever foremost) that your voice Was mainly raised for speed. Raneval. I grant you that: No man is more for speed, my Lords, than I, So we outrun not wisdom. Bourbon. Next—proceed. Lestovet. My Lord the Admiral was next, and last The Souldich of Sanxere; the English fleet Expected shortly; winter distant now But few days' journey; mallets at your backs,— These were their fruitful topics: on the last, An't please your Lordships to vouchsafe me audience, Some tidings have I gather'd, here and there, Which haply not unworthy of your ears You might, when heard, pronounce. Bourbon. Say on, Sir; well? Lestovet. At Paris, when the commons, serfs, and boors, Beat in the prison doors, ye know, my Lords, That Aubriot their friend, the sometime Provost, Who lay in prison then, made good his flight To Arc in Burgundy; and thence, I learn, He look'd abroad, and journeying up and down, He practised with the towns upon the Marne, With Rheims and Chalons, Toul and Bar-le-duc, With sundry villages in Vermandois, And Brieche and Laon; so he moved the poor (Through help, as I believe, of something evil, From which God shield good men!) that straight they slew The chatelains and farmers of the aids. They next would march to Paris in hot haste; But Nicholas le Flamand bade them wait Until the Scheldt were 'twixt the King and them, Which shelter found, he trusted with their aid To bring the castle of the Louvre low, And not of Paris only, but of France And Burgundy to make the mean folk Lords. This have I gather'd from the last that left Champagne and Beauvoisin. Bourbon. Something of this Reach'd me last night. The Constable. I had some tidings too. The Admiral. And I. Bourbon. I think, my Lords, this matter asks A further inquest. If the whole be true, We were not wise to overlook it. No, Let us take order so to sift the truth That we may meet to-morrow clear of sight; Till when I deem it prudent we should hang In a free judgment. St. Just. Till to-morrow, then. The Constable. One day's delay will hurt us not. Sanxere. To-morrow. Saimpi. To-morrow be it, then. The Admiral. At noon, my Lords? Bourbon. To-morrow noon. Sir Oliver of Clisson, Wilt please you ride? The Constable. Your Highness does me honour. The King. Dear uncle, is the Council up? Bourbon. It is. The King. Take that, old Tristram. Bourbon. Soberly, fair cousin; You do not well to toss about the parchments. Ho! tell my serving-men we ride to Vis, The Constable and I. Adieu, fair Sirs. [Exeunt the King and the Lords of the Council. Manent Tristram of Lestovet and Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Lestovet. Go to the Duke; tell him his end is gained. Sir Fleureant. But is it so? Lestovet. It is as good. Sir Fleureant. They seek Some further knowledge. Lestovet. Tut! they know it all; They knew it ere I told them; but my mind As touching it they knew not of till now. Run to the Duke; pray him to keep his chamber; Let him but stand aloof another day, And come the next, we march upon Commines. [Exit. Sir Fleureant. Run to the Duke? Run to the Devil. Yea, Tis thither Lestovet would have me run, With him to lead the way. And, to say truth, I for a small consideration now Would sell myself to Satan—or the Duke. Scene IV. —The Market-place at Ypres. In front, Van Whelk, a Householder, driving the last nails into a Scaffolding erected against his House. Van Winkel, another, looking on. A Woman is scouring the doorstead of the next house. At some little distance six Gallows-trees are seen, opposite the Stadt-House. Whelk. Room for five ducats at a groat a head. Winkel. 'Twill be a piteous spectacle! Good-day, How do you, Mistress? Woman. Thank you, how's yourself? Winkel. 'Twill be a sight most piteous to behold! A corporation hung! Woman. Alack a day! Whelk. 'Twill be a sight that never yet was seen Since Ypres was a town. A groat is cheap; A groat is very reasonable cheap. Winkel. The Burgomaster was confess'd at seven; He is the first. Whelk. Van Rosendael the next, And then comes Drimmelen, Verstolken then, And Goswin Hex, and Breero, and De Vry. Winkel. This ancient corporation! Woman. Wo's the day! Poor gentlemen; alas, they did not think, Nor no man else, the Regent would take life So hastily. Whelk. The like was never seen, Nor ever will be after. Winkel. Hold you there; Come the French King and we shall see this square More thick with gallows than with butchers' stalls Upon a market day. Woman. Nay, God forbid! Master Van Winkel, sure you say not so? Winkel. It is not saying it that hangs them, dame: I tell you it is true. Woman. There's some have said King Charles was tender-hearted as a lamb; The Dukes his uncles likewise; and that none Were loather to shed blood. Winkel. Those burghers said it Whom yonder gallows wait for; and if lies Were worthy hanging they deserved their doom. Woman. Well, Sirs, I know not. Winkel. Tut! King Charles, I say, The Dukes his uncles and his Councillors all Are of one flesh and follow after kind. There are humane amongst them! how humane? Humane to Lords and Ladies, Kings and Counts. Humane to such as we? Believe it not. Whelk. The Earl of Flanders is the French King's cousin. Winkel. To show his cousin kindness, good King Charles Would canter over acres of our dead. His cousin is in what he calls distress; To succour the distress'd is kind and good; So with an army comes the good King Charles And kindly to his cousin cuts our throats. And that is their humanity, and such Is Man's humanity the wide world through. Men's hearts you'll find on one side soft as wax, Hard as the nether mill-stone on the other. Whelk. How is it with your own, Dame Voorst? Woman. God's love! I would not hurt a hair upon the head Of any man alive. Winkel. Look you—the Earl— But hearken to a tale: Once in my youth— Ah, Mistress Voorst! years, years, they steal upon us! But what! you're comely yet,—well, in my youth Occasion was that I should wend my way From Reninghelst to Ronques, to gather there Some moneys that were owing me; the road Went wavering like jagged lightning through the moors,— For mind, Van Whelk, in those days Rening Fell Was not so sluiced as now;—the night was near And wore an ugly likeness to a storm, When, weary and misdoubting of my way, I spied the flickering of a cottage fire Thorough the casements; thither sped my feet: The door was open'd by a buxom dame Who smiled and bade me welcome, and great cheer She made me, with a jocund, stirring mien Of kindly entertainment, whilst with logs Crackled the fire, and seem'd the very pot To bubble in a hospitable hurry That I might sup betimes. Now say, Dame Voorst, Was not the mistress of this cottage lone A kind good soul? Woman. Yea, truly was she, Sir. Winkel. Master Van Whelk, what think you? Whelk. Let me see; Did she take nothing from you? Winkel. Not a groat. Whelk. Why, that was charitable; that was kind; That was a woman of the good old times. Winkel. Now mark, Van Whelk; now listen, Mistress Voorst. The seething-pan upon the fire contain'd Six craw-fish for my supper; as I stood Upon the ruddy hearth, my addle head As empty as my stomach but more at rest, My eyes chanced fix upon the bubbling pot: Unconsciously a while I gazed, as one Seeing that sees not; but ere long appear'd A tumbling and a labouring in the pot More than of boiling water; whereupon, Looking with eyes inquisitive, I saw The craw-fish rolling one upon another, Bouncing, and tossing all their legs abroad That writhed and twisted as mix'd each with each They whirl'd about the pan. God's grace! quoth I, These craw-fish are alive! Yea, Sir, she answered, They are not good but when they're sodden quick. I said no more, but turn'd me from the hearth Feeling a sickness here; and inwardly I cried Heigh-ho! that for one man's one meal Six of God's creatures should be boil'd alive! Woman. Lord help us, Sir! you wail about the fish As they were Christians. Winkle. Look you, Mistress Voorst; The King will be as kind to Louis Mâle As this good wife to me; for us mean folk We are but craw-fish; in his noble zeal To serve his cousin 'twere to him no sin To boil us in a pot.—Back, back, Van Whelk! Here be the Captains! [They retire. Enter Vauclaire, Roosdyk, and Van Den Bosch's Lieutenant. Vauclaire. Shrewd news! whence cams't thou last? Lieutenant. From St. Eloy. Roosdyk. On Monday did they cross? Lieutenant. On Monday night, And all night long; they crossed by nines and tens; The boat would hold no more. Roosdyk. And seen of none? Were there none watching of those jobbernowls That follow Van den Bosch? Lieutenant. The night was dark; The most part of our men were sent to sleep In quarters at Commines, that they might rise Fresh on the morrow, when the French, 'twas thought, Would try the passage by the bridge. The rest Kept guard upon the causeway. Two miles down The river crankles round an alder grove; 'Twas there they brought the boats; strong stakes were driven In either bank, and ropes were pass'd betwixt, Stretching athwart the stream; by aid of these Hand over hand they tugged themselves across And hid within the thicket; when day dawn'd They still were crossing, but the Constable, Who always kept his ground, made show to force The passage of the bridge, and brought us there To handy-strokes, which so misled our eyes That nothing else was seen. Roosdyk. Ha, ha! I love you! Set you to watch the cat! Lieutenant. When first we knew Their stratagem, six banners could we count, And thirty pennons on the hither bank, The Lord of Saimpi leading them: were there Sir Herbeaux of Bellperche, Sir John of Roy, The Lords of Chaudronne, Malestroit, Sanxere, All Bretons, with Sir Oliver of Guesclin, Sir Tristram de la Jaille, and, to be short, The flower of all their host, from Poictou, Troyes, Artois and Hainault, Burgundy and France, That had their station marshall'd in the van. Vauclaire. And there they stood? Lieutenant. As yet they had not fought When I was order'd thence: for Van den Bosch Upon the eminence beside the bridge Awaited them as on a vantage ground, Whilst they abode below to gather force From them continually that cross'd the stream. Vauclaire. Then went you to the good towns near? Lieutenant. To Bergues, To Poperinguen, Rolers, Warneston, To Mesiers and Vertain, with strict command From Van den Bosch to muster all their men And send him succour; thence I hasten'd here To pray you do the like. Roosdyk. Oh rare! What next? Didst ever see one beggar dropping alms Into another's hat? Lieutenant. My master sware If he should lose the day the cause should lie In that misfortunate wasting of his strength By sending aid to Ypres. Vauclaire. Send it back And he shall lose the battle, we the town, Ere it shall reach him; from the nearer posts He may get aid more opportune; meanwhile, Lest evil hap betide him, which when known Would bring a wild destruction upon us, Behoves us send the Regent instant news Of our predicament. Christoffel Waal, Mount thee thy horse and hie to Oudenarde, And bid the Regent know the Lis is pass'd. That said is all said: he shall know by that We shall have much ado with this good town Ere many days be gone, or many hours. If he can help us, so. Roosdyk. Ay, mount thy nag And make his heels strike fire: away, begone! Vauclaire. Know'st thou thy message? Waal. Sirs, from point to point. [Exit. [A bell tolls. Muffled drums are heard, and the head of a Procession appears entering the Marketplace. The Procession is formed chiefly by Friars and Guards; and lastly appear the Burgomaster and Aldermen of several Guilds as Malefactors, with their arms pinioned. They form a line between the Gallows and the Stadt-house. The Market-place suddenly fills with the Populace. Vauclaire. This folk looks strangely! guess you what's toward? Is the news known? Roosdyk. I see no women here; There is a mischievous intent. Vauclaire. Go you And get our men of battle under arms; This means a rescue; we shall have to fight. Roosdyk. Let the clerks hold the culprits unconfessed Some fifteen minutes, and I'll bring you here The most I can; and till I come again Let no knave swing, for that should be their sign Doubtless for rising. I'll be here anon. [Exit. Enter a Pricker. Vauclaire. Thy spurs are bloody—what, from Commines, ha! A battle lost? Pricker. 'Tis so, Sir. Van den Bosch With what remains of us is flying hither And wills you arm. Vauclaire. We shall be arm'd anon: And some of us you see. [He beckons to the Captain of the Guard who has charge of the prisoners. Sir, draw your men More close upon their charge and look about, For here's foul weather. [Cries begin to be heard and stones are thrown, one of which hits the steel cap of Vauclaire. Said I not? look here! These drops forerun the storm. [A cry is heard at the opposite corner of the Marketplace, and Van den Bosch's Page is seen approaching. Lo,—stand aside; There is a face I'll swear I've sometimes seen Attending Van den Bosch. Pricker. His page, I think. Page. My master, Sir, is near— Vauclaire. Say'st thou!—how near? Page. Close on the town; he enters now. Vauclaire. What force Comes with him? Page. It is hard to say; they ride So scatter'd and so broken, wounded most, And mile by mile, now one and now another, They tumble from their horses. He himself Is sorely piked and gash'd, and of his hurts One, the leech deems, is mortal. Vauclaire. Christ forbid! Page. They bear him in a litter, and each jog They give him, when the bearers change their hands, Makes him to bleed afresh. Pricker. See, there he comes! [The tumult, which had been increasing, is in some measure stilled as Van den Bosch is borne across the Market-place to the front of the scene. Van den Bosch (raising himself in the litter). Who's that? Vauclaire? We're ruin'd, Sir, we're lost! How stand ye here? Vauclaire. The worst is what I see. Yet hath the town an evil inclination, And we shall feel it suddenly. Van den Bosch. Send forth— Be still, thou jumping villain, with thy jolts! Thou grind'st my bones to powder. Oh! oh! oh! I would thou hadst my shoulder.—Send abroad, And bid the Commons to the Market-place. Vauclaire. Nay, here they are, as thick as they can stand. Van den Bosch. Are they? My eyesight fails me. And is this The Market-place? Oh, ho! then lift me up Upon some cart or tumbril or the like To make a preachment to the people. Vauclaire. Nay, Leave that to me: betake thee to thy bed; Roosdyk is making muster of our force, And what is instant to be cared for here We will perform. Van den Bosch. Not whilst I live, Vauclaire. The leech, I think, has patch'd me up this body To last a season. Hoist me—have a care— Mount me upon this scaffolding: up, up— Smoothly and all together—there we go— Oh! oh! that's thou again, uneasy whelp! Hast the string-halt? Now set me down;—so—so. Let silence be commanded. [The soldiery fall back so as to admit the people to the space immediately in front of the scaffolding. Sundry officers pass to and fro, vociferating “Silence!” which is obtained. Friends, Sirs of Ypres! Dear friends of Ypres! we have lost a battle. This once, by evil hap, the day is theirs: Which is no fault of mine; for, Sirs, I'll tell you How this hath chanced. By the Black Art (which Frenchmen dare to use For lack of godlier courage)—by this art They brought a cloudy film upon the eyes Of half our host, the half that should have watch'd; Which was on Monday night: and thus ere dawn They cross'd the Lis. Then, Sirs, what force had I Without advantage to affront the flower Of the French van? Solely twelve thousand spears! Yet like a hedge-pig tuck'd I up my power The softer parts within, and when Sanxere Came nuzzling like a dog to find some flesh Whereon to fix and turn me inside out, I'll warrant you I prick'd his snout a little! Well, Sirs, we might have conquer'd but that then The Commons of Commines—bell, book, and candle Curse them that pass for Flemings and are none!— They of Commines, that call'd themselves so stout, Show'd such a fear and faintness of their hearts As makes me sweat with shame to think upon; And, traitors in their flight, they fired the town To stay the following French. From that time forth, Seeing we had no holding-place behind, The best began to falter; and in brief Ye see us here.—Fellow, some wine! I tire; I've lost some blood. Vauclaire. Prithee go in-a-doors, And let thy hurts be tended. Van den Bosch (a cup of wine having been brought, which he drinks off). Softly, Sirs: There's more to say. [An arrow, shot from the crowd, strikes the scaffolding close to Van den Bosch, whereupon loud cries are heard from both parties and some blows pass between them, followed by great uproar and confusion. Who hinders my discourse With shooting croos-bow shafts? Oh, there you are! See you you villain there that gapes and shouts? Send me an arrow down his throat.—I say This battle lost is nothing lost at all. For thus the French are wiled across the Lis, Which ne'er shall they repass. Inveigled on By wheedling fortune, they shall thus be snared: For hither come the Regent from the Scheldt, And hither come the English, that are now Landed at Dunkirk—landed now, I tell you; The news was brought me yesterday; which heard, Verily I was glad I lost this battle, Although it cost me something—(for ye see How I am troubled in my head and shoulder)— Yea truly I rejoiced that thus the French Should run upon a pit-fall, whilst we sweep A circle round them, so that none—more wine— Sinks suddenly back in the litter. Here is a bandage loose—stanch me this blood— Look ye, I bleed to death—oh, doctor vile! Oh treacherous chirurgeon!—endless fire Crumble his bones in hell!—I die! I die! Vauclaire. (helping to re-adjust the bandage). Another ply; how draw it tight; anon Roosdyk will come and give us escort hence; Meanwhile defend yourselves and shoot again If ye be shot at. Van den Bosch. Now the trumpets sound! Chains for the King! The trumpets sound again! Chains for the Knights and Nobles! Victory! Thou gaoler, shut the doors. 'Tis very dark! Whose hand is this?—Van Artevelde's?—I thank you: 'Twas fortune favour'd me. Chains, chains and death! Chains for the King of France!—You've shut me in. It is all over with me now, good mother. Let the bells toll. Vauclaire. Bring him behind these boards; The arrows now come quickly. Send a flight— They've loosed the prisoners. See, they bear this way. Shoot well together once and then fall back And force a road to Ghent with Van den Bosch Alive or dead. I follow if I can. Incomparably shot!—they're flutter'd; aye, And well they may; there-steadily, my friends; Take forth the litter first; now close your ranks; Show a back front; so—off ye go—well done! ACT V. Scene I. —Van Artevelde's Tent in the Flemish Camp before Oudenarde. Elena and Cecile. Elena. (singing). Quoth tongue of neither maid nor wife To heart of neither wife nor maid, Lead we not here a jolly life Betwixt the shine and shade? Quoth heart of neither maid nor wife To tongue of neither wife nor maid, Thou wagg'st, but I am worn with strife, And feel like flowers that fade. There was truth in that, Cecile. Cecile. Fie on such truth! Rather than that my heart spoke truth in dumps I'd have it what it is, a merry liar. Elena. Yes, you are right; I would that I were merry! Not for my own particular, God knows; But for his cheer; he needs to be enliven'd; And for myself in him; because I know That often he must think me dull and dry, I am so heavy-hearted, and at times Outright incapable of speech. Oh me! I was not made to please. Cecile. Yourself, my Lady; 'Tis true to please yourself you were not made, Being truly by yourself most hard to please; But speak for none beside; for you were made, Come gleam or gloom, all others to enchant, Wherein you never fail. Elena. Yes, but I do; How can I please him when I cannot speak? When he is absent I am full of thought, And fruitful in expression inwardly, And fresh and free and cordial is the flow Of my ideal and unheard discourse, Calling him in my heart endearing names, Familiarly fearless. But alas! No sooner is he present than my thoughts Are breathless and bewitch'd, and stunted so In force and freedom, that I ask myself Whether I think at all, or feel, or live, So senseless am I! Cecile. Heed not that, my Lady; Men heed it not; I never heard of one That quarrell'd with his lady for not talking. I have had lovers more than I can count, And some so quarrelsome a slap in the face Would make them hang themselves if you'd believe them; But for my slackness in the matter of speech They ne'er reproach'd me: no, the testiest of them Ne'er fish'd a quarrel out of that. Elena. Thy swains Might bear their provocations in that kind, Yet not of silence prove themselves enamour'd. But mark you this, Cecile: your grave and wise And melancholy men, if they have souls, As commonly they have, susceptible Of all impressions, lavish most their love Upon the blithe and sportive, and on such As yield their want and chase their sad excess With jocund salutations, nimble talk, And buoyant bearing. Would that I were merry! Mirth have I valued not before; but now What would I give to be the laughing fount Of gay imagination's ever bright And sparkling phantasies! Oh, all I have, (Which is not nothing though I prize it not,) My understanding soul, my brooding sense, My passionate fancy, and the gift of gifts Dearest to woman which deflowering Time, Slow ravisher, from clenched'st fingers wrings— My corporal beauty, would I barter now For such an antic and exulting spirit As lives in lively women. Who comes hither? Cecile. 'Tis the old Friar; he they sent abroad; That ancient man so yellow! Od's my life! He's yellower than he went. Note but his look; His rind's the colour of a mouldy walnut. Troth! his complexion is no wholesomer Than a sick frog's. Elena. Be silent; he will hear. Cecile. It makes me ill to look at him. Elena. Hush! hush! Cecile. It makes me very ill. Enter Father John of Heda. Father John. Your pardon, Lady; I seek the Regent. Elena. Please you, sit a while; He comes anon. Father John. This tent is his? Elena. It is. Father John. And likewise yours.—(Aside.) Yea, this is as I heard; A wily woman hither sent from France. Alas! alas! how frail the state of man! How weak the strongest! This is such a fall As Samson suffer'd. Cecile (aside to Elena). How the friar croaks! What gibbering is this? Elena. May we not deem Your swift return auspicious? Sure it denotes A prosperous mission? Father John. What I see and hear Of sinful courses and of nets and snares Encompassing the feet of them that once Were steadfast deem'd, speaks only to my heart Of coming judgments. Cecile. What I see and hear Of naughty Friars and of— Elena. Peace, Cecile! Go to your chamber; you forget yourself. Father, your words afflict me. [Exit Cecile. Enter Artevelde. Artevelde (as he enters). Who is it says That Father John is come? Ah! here he is. Give me your hand, good Father! For your news, Philosophy befriend me that I show No strange impatience; for your every word Must touch me in the quick. Father John. To you alone Would I address myself. Artevelde. Nay, heed not her; She is my Privy Councillor. Father John. My Lord, Such Councillors I abjure. My function speaks, And through me speaks the Master whom I serve; After strange women them that went astray God never prosper'd in the olden time, Nor will He bless them now. An angry eye That sleeps not follows thee till from thy camp Thou shalt have put away the evil thing. This in her presence will I say— Elena. Oh God! Father John. That whilst a foreign leman— Artevelde. Nay, spare her; To me say what thou wilt. Father John. Thus then it is: This foreign tie is not to Heaven alone Displeasing, but to those on whose firm faith Rests under Heaven your all; 'tis good you know It is offensive to your army—nay, And justly, for they deem themselves betray'd When circumvented thus by foreign wiles They see their chief. Elena. Oh! let me quit the camp. Misfortune follows wheresoe'er I come; My destiny on whomsoe'er I love Alights: it shall not, Artevelde, on thee; For I will leave thee to thy better star And pray for thee aloof. Father John. Thou shalt do well For him and for thyself; the camp is now A post of danger. Elena. Artevelde! Oh God! In such an hour as this—in danger's hour— How can I quit thee? Father John. Dost thou ask? I say, As thou wouldst make his danger less or more Depart or stay. The universal camp, Nay more, the towns of Flanders are agape With tales of sorceries, witcheries and spells, That blind their chief and yield him up a prey To treasons foul. How much is true or false I know not and I say not: but this truth I sorrowfully declare,—that ill repute And sin and shame grow up with every hour That sees you link'd together in these bonds Of spurious love. Elena. Father, enough is said. Clerk's eyes nor soldier's will I more molest By tarrying here. Seek other food to feed Your pious scorn and pertinent suspicions. Alien from grace and sinful though I be, Yet is there room to wrong me. I will go Lest this injustice done to me work harm Unto my Lord the Regent. Artevelde. Hold, I say; Give me a voice in this. You, Father John, I blame not, nor myself will justify: But call my weakness what you will, the time Is past for reparation. Now to cast off The partner of my sin were further sin; 'Twere with her first to sin, and next against her. And for the army, if their trust in me Be sliding, let it go; I know my course; And be it armies, cities, people, priests, That quarrel with my love, wise men or fools, Friends, foes, or factions, they may swear their oaths, And make their murmur—rave, and fret, and fear, Suspect, admonish—they but waste their rage, Their wits, their words, their counsel: Here I stand Upon the deep foundations of my faith To this fair outcast plighted, and the storm That Princes from their palaces shakes out, Though it should turn and head me, should not strain The seeming silken texture of this tie.— To business next:—Nay, leave us not, Beloved; I will not have thee go as one suspect; Stay and hear all. Father, forgive my heat, And do not deem me stubborn. Now at once The English news? Father John. Your deeds upon your head! Be silent my surprise—be told my tale. No open answer from the English King Could we procure, no honest yea or nay, But only grave denotements of good-will, With mention of the perils of the seas, The much tempestuous season, and the loss Unspeakable that England suffer'd late In her sea strengths; but not the less, they said, By reason of good love and amity, The King should order reckonings to be made By two sufficient scholars of the charge Of what we sought; his Parliament then called He would take counsel of, and send you word What might be done. Artevelde. A leisurely resolve. The King took counsel of his own desires, Ere of his Lords and Commons. Had he wish'd To do this thing, he had not ask'd advice. In the pure polity of a Monarch's mind The will is Privy Councillor to the judgment. When shall his answer reach us? Father John. In my wake Sir Richard Farrington, I found, came fast, And sped by favourabler winds than mine Reach'd Dunkirk with me. Letters seal'd he brought; But hearing how far forth the French had fared, He halted, and would neither bring nor send His letters, nor their purport would disclose. Artevelde. But you, I think, can guess it. Father John. Surely yes: They promised, doubtless, largely; but were meant To be deliver'd should you thrive—not else. The English nobles, though they'd use your arms If victory crown'd them, to encumber France, Much in their secret minds mislike your cause. Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, Lister, Walker, Ball, That against servage raised the late revolt, Were deem'd the spawn of your success: last year Has taught the Nobles that their foes at home Are worthier notice than the French. In truth They should not be displeased at any ill That might befall you. Artevelde. Father, so I think. Lo! with the chivalry of Christendom I wage my war—no nation for my friend, Yet in each nation having hosts of friends. The bondsmen of the world, that to their Lords Are bound with chains of iron, unto me Are knit by their affections. Be it so. From Kings and Nobles will I seek no more Aid, friendship, nor alliance. With the poor I make my treaty, and the heart of man Sets the broad seal of its allegiance there And ratifies the compact. Vassals, serfs, Ye that are bent with unrequited toil, Ye that have whiten'd in the dungeon dark Through years that knew not change of night and day— Tatterdemalions, lodgers in the hedge, Lean beggars with raw backs and rumbling maws Whose poverty was whipp'd for starving you,— I hail you my auxiliars and allies, The only potentates whose help I crave. Richard of England, thou hast slain Jack Straw, But thou hast left unquench'd the vital spark That set Jack Straw on fire. The spirit lives; And as when he of Canterbury fell His seat was filled by some no better clerk, So shall John Ball that slew him be replaced; And if I live and thrive, these English Lords Double requital shall be served withal For this their double-dealing.—Pardon me; You are but just dismounted, and the soil Of travel is upon you; food and rest You must require. Attendance there! what ho! Enter two Serving-ment. These will supply your wants. To-morrow morn We will speak more together. Father John, Though peradventure fallen in your esteem, I humbly ask your blessing, as a man That having pass'd for more in your repute That he had warrant for, should be content, Not with his state, but with the judgment true That to the lowly level of his state Brings down his reputation. Father John. Oh, my son! High as you stand, I will not strain mine eyes To see how higher still you stood before. God's blessing be upon you! Fare you well. [Exit. Artevelde. The old man weeps. Let England play me false, The greater is my glory if the day Is won without her aid. I stand alone; And standing so against the mingled might Of Burgundy and France, to hold mine own Is special commendation; to prevail So far as victory were high renown; To be foredone no singular disgrace. Enter an Attendant, followed by a Man-at-arms. Whom have we here,—Rovarden? Attendant. Please your Grace, A scout from Van den Bosch. Artevelde. And with ill news Thy face would say. What is it? Scout. With your leave, My master bids you know that yesterday Some cunning Frenchmen stole across the Lis In boats and rafts, a league below Commines, And now they press him hard upon his rear; Wherefore he warns you that you look to Ypres, Which he can do no longer. Artevelde. The Lis pass'd! Mischief, be welcome, if thou com'st alone! Is that the worst? Scout. 'Tis all, my Lord, I know. Elena. Is it so very bad? Artevelde. No, no, 'tis not. Let him have food and wine; he has ridden hard And lacks refreshment. Go, repair thy looks, And make me no such signals in my camp Of losses and mishap. Speak cheerily To whomsoe'er thou seest. [Exeunt Attendant and Scout. No, 'tis untoward, Luckless, unfortunate; but that is all. If Ypres bear as stoutly up against it As I can do, we're not so much the worse. Enter Van Ryk,followed by a Messenger. Van Ryk. A messenger, my Lord, from Ypres. Artevelde. Ha! Here is another ugly face of news! What now? Messenger. My Lord, sure tidings came last night That Van den Bosch was worsted on the Lis, And with a broken force was falling back On Ypres for protection. Artevelde. Is that all? Messenger. It is, my Lord. Artevelde. It is enough. What news Had ye of Menin, Werwick, and Messines? Messenger. The bells were rung in each and they were bid To send all aid that they could muster straight To Van den Bosch; but little went or none. Artevelde. And doubtless now the Frenchman has them all? Messenger. I know not that, my Lord. Artevelde. But I do. Go; Thou art a wofuller fellow than the last, Yet cheerfuller than what is like to follow. Get thee to dinner and be spare of speech. Messenger. My master bade me to entreat your Grace To send him instant aid. Artevelde. To Ypres? What! He's mad to think it! How should aid get there, With all the Upper Lis, as past a doubt It must be now, from Warneston to Courtray, O'errun with French? I will not send a man. It were but to lose more. Messenger. My master, Sir, Was fearful of the burghers. Artevelde. So he might, And I am troubled at his jeopardy; Far liefer would I part with this right hand Than with Vauclaire, his service and his love. I think the burghers will hold off a while To see the issue of my personal arms. If not, I cannot help him. If they do, That which is best for all is best for him. Go: keep thy counsel; talk not in the camp. [Exit Messenger. Van Ryk. Rumour goes further in the camp, my Lord, Than where his story stops. Artevelde. Ay, does it? How? Van Ryk. Ypres revolted; Van den Bosch, Vauclaire, And Roosdyk slain or taken; so it runs Since noon. Elena. Oh! this is worse than all. Artevelde. If true; But be not hasty of belief. Go in. No matters for a feminine Council these. Elena. Oh, let me stay with you! Artevelde. Not now, my love. [Exit Elena. Worst rumours now will still be likest truth, And yet if Ypres truly had been lost, Undoubted news of such a deadly blow Had surely reach'd us. Van Ryk. If you mark, my Lord, Mostly a rumour of such things precedes The certain tidings. Artevelde. It is strange, yet true, That doubtful knowledge travels with a speed Miraculous, which certain cannot match. I know not why, when this or that has chanced, The smoke outruns the flash, but so it is. Why who comes here? Vauclaire himself! Enter Vauclaire, in disordered apparel and covered with the soil of travel. Vauclaire, Thy coming speaks; it tells of Ypres lost; Perhaps of worse; and thou art welcome still! Can friendship speak thee fairer? Vauclaire. Thanks, my Lord, You have lost Ypres; 'tis no worse nor better. Artevelde. I can spare Ypres so I keep Vauclaire. Let the town go. How came you off alive? Vauclaire. The rascal burghers tied me hand and foot And on a hurdle trailed me like a thief Toward King Charles's camp upon the mount; Half way to which some twenty of my guard, With Roosdyk at their head, brake boldly in, Crying a rescue, and ere aid could come We were safe mounted upon chosen nags That distanced all pursuit. Artevelde. Why that is well. Where's Roosdyk? Vauclaire. Eating, I'll be sworn, and drinking. Artevelde. And Van den Bosch? Vauclaire. That is a sadder tale; I fear he lives no longer. Artevelde. Ay, Vauclaire! Vauclaire. Much wounded from Commines he came to Ypres, Whence we despatch'd him, less alive than dead, Upon the road to Ghent. I hardly think That he can live the journey through. Artevelde. Farewell, Brave Van den Bosch! and God assoil thy soul! Vauclaire, we must be stirring; to the dead An after time will give the meed of mourning; Our present days are due to them that live. Let us to Council with my officers: And sit by me; for in my host henceforth Thou shalt be next me in authority. Vauclaire. Deep are my debts to your good-will, my Lord; More than my life can pay. Artevelde. Nay, say no more; You owe me nothing; what I have to give Is held in trust and parted with for service; Value received is writ on my commissions, Nor would I thank the man that should thank me For aught as given him gratis. Let's to Council. I'll lie no longer here at Oudenarde To hear of towns betraying me. Our camp We must break up to-morrow and push on Boldly to Courtray and the Lower Lis. The towns to the North and West will falter else And Frenchify their faith. It is God's mercy That some seven thousand citizens of Bruges Are in my host, whose heads will pledges be For what might fail me there. From Damme and Sluys, From Dendermonde, the Quatre-Metiers, Ghent, From Ardenburg and Grammont and Alost, We'll bring the rear-guard up. The Lis, the Lis! Let me but reach the Lis before King Charles! Vauclaire. The Upper Lis were easily regain'd Could we but keep the Lower. Artevelde. We shall see. Enter Van Ryk. Van Ryk. A countryman, my Lord, arrived from Heule Says that King Charles is on his march to Rosebecque. Artevelde. To Rosebecque let him come! With God's good-speed. I shall be there before him. Sirs, to Council. Scene II. —The French Camp at Winkel St. Eloy. Enter from opposite sides the Duke of Burgundy and Tristram of Lestovet. Burgundy. Another town come in, I hear; that's ten. Now, Lestovet, they'll own I knew my way. Ypres and Dunkirk, Cassel, Thorout, Bergues, Make five wall'd towns, and Popperinguen six; And then there's Werwick, Vailant, and Messines, And now comes Rousselaere, which rounds the tale. Anon they'll say that I had reason, ha? Lestovet. They will, my Lord. Success will couch the blind. The wise by speculation know to trade, And give their wits long credit and they thrive; A scrambling wit must live from hand to mouth On issues and events. Prosperity Is warranty of wisdom with the world; Failure is foolishness. Now all will prize Your Grace's judgment at its worth. [A cry within, “Place ho!” Enter the King, with the Constable, the Lords of Saimpi and Sanxere and others; and lastly, some-what apart from the rest, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. The King. Well, uncle, here we are! Get supper ready. How fast you rode! I gallop'd half a mile— But then St. Poule, he blew—oh, he's too fat! Is not the Bastard of St. Poule too fat? Saimpi. May't please your Highness, he is grossly fat. The King. I gallop'd—uncle, what is this? Lo me! A span-new sword—by God, of Spanish steel And longer than mine own—uncle, by God, A King's sword should be longer than a Duke's; I must have this; this is a royal sword. Burgundy. Cousin, you are not tall enough to wear it. The King. Not tall enough indeed! Is supper ready? When shall we get to Rosebecque? Here's St. Poule. Enter St. Poule. So, here you come, you broken-winded bastard, You're always left behind. How long to Rosebecque? Tell me, my Lords, to-morrow will it be? Constable. Your Highness, having weather to your wish, Might lodge at Rosebecque with your vanguard force To-morrow night. The King. And when shall come the rear? Constable. On Wednesday morning. The King. And on Thursday night The Bastard of St. Poule. For Rosebecque, ho! Remember, uncle, when the armies meet, I am to make the knights; four hundred Knights; The Constable himself will tell you so; Four hundred fire-new Knights there should be made Before the battle joins; and I'm to make them. My Lord of Clisson, am I not? Thwack, thwack, Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, will go my sword, thwack, thwack. You, Lestovet, you, Tristram, kneel you down And I will—thwack—I'll try my hand—thwack, thwack. Burgundy. Come, cousin, come, you're wanton. Go within And eat your supper. The King. What, is supper there? Lights, lights here, ho! Come, bastard, come along. The first of a feast and the last of a fray Has been a wise word for this many a day! [Exit, followed by all but the Duke of Burgundy and Lestovet. Burgundy. You southern sky is black; were rain to fall Our van could hardly, in but one day's march, Arrive at Rosebecque; or if press'd so far, 'Twould tell against their strength the morrow morn And stop them there. Lestovet. My Lord, that there they'll stop I doubt not; for I'm inmostly assured That we shall find upon the Lower Lis The total Flemish host: the Lower Lis They to the utmost will dispute, for there Their Chief, who lacks not capability, Will justly deem their all to be impledged. 'Twere not amiss to slack the vanguard's pace And quicken up the rear, that like a worm The army's tail should gather to its head Before it move again. Burgundy. It may be well. Your thought is mine touching the Flemish host; It will be found at Rosebecque, and, God willing, It shall be left to feed the vultures there. Where'er 'tis met, that such will be its fate I am as sure as that this glove is steel And I am Duke of Burgundy. Lestovet. My Lord, That yonder Flemish scum, with coats of mail Not worth three folds of cloth, should hold at bay The spear-heads of Bourdeaux, were doubtless strange; And yet such things have happen'd. In their Chief Resides the spell which makes this herd so mad To brave the chivalry of France in arms. Their Chief is either leagued with Hell himself Or hath some potent necromancer's aid; If he be not the Devil's feudatory He holds in soccage of a Fiend that is. You'll see a hundred thousand spell-bound hearts By art of witchcraft so affatuate That for his love they'd dress themselves in dowlas And fight with men of steel. Burgundy. At Bruges, 'tis true, They dared but little less. Lestovet. Methinks, my Lord, The Knight of Heurlée is of late much changed. Burgundy. It may be so; what, since he joined us last? Lestovet. He hath a dirty, wild, neglected mien; Is careless of his garb, gets drunk alone, Lies late a-bed as skulking from the day, Curses his serving-men, avoids his friends, Is quarrelsome and very meagre-witted To what he was, save only in his gibes, And them less savoury season'd; what was once An ounce of venom to a pound of mirth Apportion'd t'other way. In truth he's changed; A moody, heavy, sad-condition'd man, That had from nature a most mounting heart, And revell'd formerly in joys to him As native and as unsolicited As to the lark her song. Burgundy. Whence comes this change? Lestovet. In truth, my Lord, I know not. Burgundy. Hear'st thou nought? Is nothing said, surmised? what think'st thou, ha? Some secret discontent? Lestovet. Not that, my Lord. More likely that he finds his knightly name Something bedimm'd and held in less esteem By reason of his flight from Oudenarde: For though he will not own it, 'tis believed He was at large upon his honour's pawn To keep within the Flemish camp, and fled, Leaving the pledge behind him. Burgundy. Nothing more? Lestovet. That is one wound; but there's another yet; Whether by word or blow or both 'twas dealt I know not, for he's reticent and shy To a close question; but this much I know,— That in the sleeping-chamber of a maid (So called for courtesy) he was caught at night, Concealed for no good purpose, whereupon The Regent (so by courtesy again— As much a Regent he as she a maid) Who entertain'd the damsel for himself, Moved by his anger, offer'd to the Knight, In act or threat, some dire indignity, That ever since hath poison'd all the springs At which his spirit drank, and is the cause, If my conjecture err not, that he stands The wither'd, blacken'd, and disfigur'd stump We see him now. Burgundy. If that be all, his grief Touches not us. Lestovet. The contrary, my Lord; It touches more the enemy. Your Grace Has possibly had read to you the tale, Long chronicled, of an Earl of Conversana, Who in the day of battle met his death, Not from his opposites in the field, though brave, But one who rode beside him. An old hate, An ancient grudge, was hoarded up till then When death was doubly bitter, bringing down Defeat and overthrow and loss of lands And ruin to his friends. 'Twere strange, my Lord, If such a fate befell Van Artevelde. Burgundy. Yes, it were very strange. Lestovet. Your Grace was right; We shall have rain: the sky looks wondrous thick. I know not if your Grace gave heed to it, But yesterday at noon or thereabouts I heard some grumblings up amongst the clouds That much resembled thunder: Pish! quoth I, The year is too far wearing from its prime To speak in thunder now. Burgundy. Who was that Earl? The Earl of Conversana? Lestovet. He, my Lord. But yet again I heard it, and more plain; And then, quoth I, if this be aught but thunder The God of thunder keeps a mocking-bird, And it is that we hear. Burgundy. Upon what ground Deem'd you the Earl of Conversana's fate Should figure forth Van Artevelde's? Lestovet. My Lord? Burgundy. What mean you by this history of that Earl? How doth it typify Van Artevelde's? How lights the one the other? Lestovet. Nay, my Lord, 'Twas but a stumbling comment of my thought. When we have strained our foresight past its power Fantastic flashes oft will come across it, And whence we nothing know. Burgundy. Come, Lestovet, Let us be open and direct. Thy drift? What did thy thought contain that, being stirred, Sent to the top this story from the past? Lestovet. The honest truth to tell, my Lord, a dream, Whether by good or evil spirit drawn Upon the vacant canvas of my sleep Your Grace shall be the judge,—a dream it was Show'd me Van Artevelde upon his horse— Though whether mounted to survey the ground, Or to array his host, or lead the charge, I saw not,—but there sitting as he gazed Upon an undistinguishable blank Of anything or nothing—what, I know not— Struck from behind he fell—and with his fall Vanish'd his host. Burgundy. This was a waking dream. Lestovet. I mused upon it waking. Burgundy. And this dream Thou think'st will peradventure come to pass? Lestovet. If fate so orders it, my Lord. Burgundy. And fate Will find some human furtherance; is it so? Lestovet. Were it a thing well warranted, my Lord, It might be well attended. Burgundy. Truly fate Should do the King a singular good service If this should happen. Lestovet. Destiny, my Lord, Is oft-times worked upon by mighty names Of Dukes and regal potentates, whose power May currently avouch her doubtful deeds If haply called in question. Burgundy. Six o'clock Were not too soon to be afoot to-morrow, If, as is likely, there be waters out Upon our lines of march. Lestovet. There's light at six. Two words, my Lord, were warranty enough. Burgundy. Why, very well then; six is late enough. Tell my Lord Constable before he sleeps To let the trumpets sound us a reveillée Some half an hour to six. Exit. Lestovet. Well said, my Lord. Your Grace's scruples master not your heart, But serve your reputation. This is conscience; A herald marshalling each act its place By its emblazonry and cognizance. My Lord of Burgundy, your Grace is wary; So, by your leave, is humble Lestovet. If policy stick fast, be tried revenge; And where's revenge more sharp, my Lord of Bourbon, Than what is sprung of jealousy. That bites. My Lord, I'll pluck your jealousy by the ear, And if it wake not, why your Grace's bosom Is not the serpent's nest I take it for. Scene III. —The Flemish Camp on the Eastern Bank of the Lis, between Disselghem and Rosebecque.— Artevelde's Pavilion. Artevelde and Elena. Elena. What is it that disturbs you? Artevelde. Nothing, nothing; I am not disturb'd. Elena. You are not like yourself. What took you from your bed ere break of day? Where have you been? I know there's something wrong. Tell me now, what has happen'd? Artevelde. Be at rest. No accident, save of the world within; Occurrences of thought; 'tis nothing more. Elena. It is of such that love most needs to know. The loud transactions of the outlying world Tell to your masculine friends; tell me your thoughts. Artevelde. They stumbled in the dusk 'twixt night and day. I dream'd distressfully, and waking knew How an old sorrow had stolen upon my sleep, Molesting midnight and that short repose Which industry had earn'd, so to stir up About my heart remembrances of pain Least sleeping when I sleep, least sleeping then When reason and the voluntary powers That turn and govern thought are laid to rest. Those powers by this nocturnal inroad wild Surprised and broken, vainly I essay'd To rally, and the mind unsubjugate Took its direction from a driftless dream. Then pass'd I forth. Elena. You stole away so softly I knew it not, and wonder'd when I woke. Artevelde. The gibbous moon was in a wan decline, And all was silent as a sick man's chamber. Mixing its small beginnings with the dregs Of the pale moonshine and a few faint stars The cold uncomfortable daylight dawned, And the white tents, topping a low ground-fog, Show'd like a fleet becalmed. I wander'd far, Till reaching to the bridge I sate me down Upon the parapet. Much mused I there, Revolving many a passage of my life And the strange destiny that lifted me To be the leader of a mighty host And terrible to Kings. What follow'd then I hardly may relate; for you would smile, And say I might have dreamed as well a-bed As gone abroad to dream. Elena. I shall not smile; And if I did, you would not grudge my lips So rare a visitation. But the cause, Whate'er it be, that casts a shadow here, [Kissing his brow. How can it make me smile? What follow'd, say, After your meditations on the bridge? Artevelde. I'll tell it, but I bid you not believe it; For I am scarce so credulous myself As to believe that was, which mine eyes saw— A visual not an actual existence. Elena. What was it like? Wore it a human form? Artevelde. That such existences there are, I know; For whether by the corporal organ framed Or painted by a brainish fantasy Upon the inner sense, not once nor twice, But sundry times have I beheld such things Since my tenth year, and most in this the last. Elena. What was it you beheld? Artevelde. To-day? Elena. Last night—This morning—when you sate upon the bridge? Artevelde. Twas a fantastic sight. Elena. What sort of sight? Artevelde (after a pause). Once in my sad and philosophic youth— For very philosophic in my dawn And twilight of intelligence was I— Once at this cock-crow of philosophy, Much tired with rest and with the stable earth, I launch'd my little bark and put to sea Errant for geste and enterprise of wit Through all this circumnavigable globe. I cavill'd at the elements—What is earth? A vast congestion of unmethodised matter With but a skin of life—a solid huge, Which Nature, prodigal of space, provides For superficial uses: and what air? A motion and a pressure: fire, a change; And light the language of the things call'd dumb. Elena. I have been told the studies of your youth Were strangely thought of, but I'm well assured They never were unlawful. Artevelde. You are right: My meditations in their outset wore The braveries of ignorance and youth, But cast them, and were innocent thenceforth, For they were follow'd with a humble heart, Though an inquisitive, and humbler still In spirit wax'd they as they further went. The elements I left to contemplate. Then I considered life in all its forms, From sentient to percipient—small advance— Next to intelligent, to rational next, So to half-spiritual human kind, And what is more, is more than man may know. Last came the troublesome question—what am I? A blade, a seedling of this growth of life Wherewith the outside of the earth is cover'd: A comprehensive atom, all the world In act of thought embracing, in the world A grain scarce filling a particular place. Thus travell'd I the region up and down Wherein the soul is circumscribed below; And unto what conclusion? Elena. Nay, your promise; Tell what you saw; I must not be denied After a promise given; tell me of that? Artevelde. I say to what conclusion came I then These winding links to fasten? Elena. I surmise To none; such ramblings end where they begin. Artevelde. Conclusions inconclusive, that I own; Yet, I would say, not vain, not nothing worth. This circulating principle of life That vivifies the outside of the earth And permeates the sea; that here and there Awakening up a particle of matter, Informs it, organizes, gives it power To gather and associate to itself, Transmute, incorporate other, for a term Sustains the congruous fabric and then quits it; This vagrant principle so multiform, Ebullient here and undetected there, Is not unauthorized nor increate, Though indestructible; life never dies: Matter dies off it and it lives elsewhere Or elsehow circumstanced and shaped; it goes; At every instant we may say 'tis gone, But never it hath ceased; the type is changed, Is ever in transition; for life's law To its eternal essence hath prescribed Eternal mutability: and thus To say I live—says, I partake of that Which never dies; but here begins, not ends, The spiritual Unit's quest of what concerns Its integral self: and here doth reason meet Her more than match. Elena. Philosophy, I know, Darkened your dawn of youth; but surely day Divulged the light divine. Artevelde. I saw it soon: Philosophy's shortcomings I discerned, And in man's instinct knew the voice of God. Man's immortality that voice declared Even from the first; but what of him should die Was for God's other and his after voice Left to be told; and then but told in part, Lest faith should sicken by satiety And lose its titles to reward. Much dies, More lives, is all we know. Elena. Love is immortal; Whatever dies, that lives in Death's despite. But, Artevelde, you shall not lead me off Through by-ways. Tell me of this sight you saw, Or dreamt you saw. Artevelde. This eye-creation;—yes, What is it to surprise us? Here we are Engender'd out of nothing cognizable. If this be not a wonder, nothing is; If this be wonderful, then all is so. Man's grosser attributes can generate What is not and has never been at all; What should forbid his fancy to restore A being passed away? The wonder lies In the mind merely of the wondering man. As for this creature of mine eyes— Elena. What was it? The semblance of a human creature? Artevelde. Yes. Elena. Like any you had known in life? Artevelde. Most like; Or more than like; it was the very same. It was the image of my wife. Elena. Of her! The Lady Adriana! Artevelde. My dead wife. Elena. Oh God! how strange! Artevelde. And wherefore?—wherefore strange? Why should not fancy summon to its presence This shape as soon as any? Elena. Artevelde! Felt you no fear at such a sight? Artevelde. No, none. Dejected I had been before: that sight Inspired a deeper sadness but no fear. Nor had it struck that sadness to my soul But for the dismal cheer the thing put on And the unsightly points of circumstance That sullied its appearance and departure. Elena. For how long saw you it? Artevelde. I cannot tell. I did not mark. Elena. And what was that you saw So saddening and unsightly? Artevelde. She appear'd In white, as when I saw her last, laid out After her death; suspended in the air She seemed, and o'er her breast her arms were crossed; Her feet were drawn together pointing down, And rigid was her form and motionless. From near her heart, as if the source were there, A stain of blood went wavering to her feet. So she remain'd inflexible as stone And I as fixedly regarding her. Then suddenly, and in a line oblique, Thy figure darted past her, whereupon, Though rigid still and straight, she downward moved, And as she pierced the river with her feet Descending steadily, the streak of blood Peel'd off upon the water, which, as she vanish'd, Appear'd all blood, and swell'd and welter'd sore, And midmost in the eddy and the whirl My own face saw I, which was pale and calm As death could make it:—then the vision pass'd, And I perceived the river and the bridge, The mottled sky and horizontal moon, The distant camp, and all things as they were. Elena. If you are not afraid to see such things, I am to hear them. Go not near that bridge;— You said that something happened there before— Oh, cross it not again. Artevelde. Not cross the bridge? The river cannot otherwise be passed. Elena. Oh, cross it not! Artevelde. A strange resolve were that, And to the French most acceptable: yes, You will be held of counsel with King Charles, Opposing thus my passage. Enter Vauclaire and Van Ryk. Sirs, good day! You're soon astir for men that watch'd so late. Vauclaire. And you, my Lord. Artevelde. For me, these eyes of mine Almost forget they once could close in sleep. Have any scouts come in? Van Ryk. Yes, two, my Lord. Artevelde. Ah! and with tidings? Nothing good I know, But let me hear. Vauclaire. In truth it is not good. They say that Popperinguen, Rousselaere, And Thorout have declared for France. Artevelde. Three more! That is a heavy falling-off, my friends, And arrantly ill-timed. Despatch! despatch! The cure for these defections must be found At any hazard. Forward must we press And try our fortune ere another town Can find occasion to play foul. Vauclaire. To-night, If I mistake not, they would reach us here; And better were it, in my mind, the stream Should be betwixt us than as much dry land. Artevelde. We will to Council, and consider there What may be best. If they be here to-night, We may abide them. Whither away, Vauclaire? Vauclaire. You'll wish, my Lord, to have the scouts and spies Before you in the Council. Artevelde. It were well. [Exit Vauclaire. And thou, Van Ryk, go round, and gather in The Captains of the host. [Exit Van Ryk. This troubles me. Three towns, and two before!—Two leaks and three— The vessel sinks: I vainly climb the mast. Elena. Oh, say not so; when once they know you're near The towns will all hold out—all will be well; Your presence ever righted your affairs Whatever was amiss. Artevelde. Two months ago My presence was a spell omnipotent That seem'd of power to win me all the world. But fortune wears a faded beauty now; And as some dame, her hour of conquest past, Repairs her ravaged charms, and here a tooth Replaces where the flesh had else fallen in Making a wrinkle in the rounded cheek, And there the nevermore redundant locks Replenishes, so do I waste my pains In patching fortunes which are past their prime. All, all is vain endeavour, labour lost. So soon as my advance made Courtray sure, Thence sent I with all speed to Rousselaere My best of Chatelains, Walraven. Nay! Toiling and striving, watching and warding, all Null, fruitless, fond! Elena. Too anxious, Artevelde, And too impatient are you grown of late. You used to be so even and so calm That nothing ruffled you. Artevelde. I stand reproved. 'Tis time and circumstance that tries us all; And they that temperately take their start And keep their souls indifferently sedate Through much of good and evil, at the last May find the weakness of their hearts thus tried. My cause appears more precious than it did In its triumphant days. Elena. You prize it more The more it is endanger'd. Artevelde. Even so. A mother dotes upon the reckling child More than the strong: solicitous cares, sad watchings, Rallies, reverses, all vicissitudes, Give the affection exercise and growth. So is it in the nursing a sick hope. Enter Vauclaire's Lieutenant. Lieutenant. The Captains are in Council met, my Lord, And wait upon your leisure. Artevelde. So; I come. Lieutenant. My master, Sir, has heard, he bade me say, That Cassel has revolted. Artevelde. What of that? Lieutenant. He wish'd that you should know it first, my Lord, And judge if it were fit to be disclosed Before the Council. Artevelde. Fit to be disclosed! Pooh! Tell the Council I am coming. No; I'll have no secrets. And for this, forsooth, What is it but that we are in the moult And here's a feather fallen? Say I come. [Exit Lieutenant. Another stab, and in a vital part! For Cassel's defalcation is no less. 'Twere hard to keep a secret that is shared By yonder ape; my nose took note of that, Admonish'd by the musk upon his beard As up and down his salutations tost it, Like a hen drinking. Well, it matters not. The battle now is all, and that to win Were to win back my losses; that to lose Were to make all that I had lost before Into one sum of loss. Elena. I feel assured That you will win the day. Artevelde. You choose to say so. Elena, think not that I stand in need Of false encouragement. I have my strength, Which, though it lie not in the sanguine mood, Will answer my occasions. To yourself, Though to none other, I at times present The gloomiest thoughts that gloomy truths inspire, Because I love you. But I need no prop; Nor could I find it in a tinsel show Of prosperous surmise. Before the world I wear a cheerful aspect, not so false As for my solace you would fain put on; Nor in my closet does the oil run low Or the light flicker. Elena. Lo now! you are angry Because I try to cheer you. Artevelde. Angry? no— Not angry; that I never was with you; But as I deal not falsely with my own, So would I wish the heart of her I love To be both true and brave; nor self-beguiled, Nor putting on disguises for my sake, As though I falter'd. I have anxious hours, As who in like extremities hath not? But I have something stable here within Which bears their strain. Enter Van Ryk. I make the Council wait; Here comes Van Ryk to tell me so. Elena. 'Twas I, Master Van Ryk, that stay'd him; 'tis my fault, And lest I make it more, I'll take me hence. [Exit. Van Ryk. The Council can abide your time, my Lord. There waits without a stranger just arrived Whom it were well you speak with ere you go. He will not lift his beaver save to you, But boldly calls himself an arrant traitor That left the French last night, and seeks your camp To tell you what he knows. Artevelde. Desert to me! I thought desertion look'd the other way. What is he like? Van Ryk. I think he is of rank; In his deportment knightly eyes might see What they would gladly imitate. Artevelde. Of rank! The very madness of desertion this! Go, fetch him in. [Exit Van Ryk. Thorout and Popperinguen! Cassel and Rousselaere! And who, I wist, Can keep a town's allegiance on its legs If not Walraven? Re-enter Van Ryk, conducting Sir Fleureant of Heurlée, in armour, with his vizor closed. Give us leave, Van Ryk. [Exit Van Ryk. Well, Sir! your pleasure? and say first by whom My camp is honour'd thus. Sir Fleureant. By one, my Lord, Known to your host by all reproachful names Of miscreant, perfidious traitor, knave, Caitiff and cur. Artevelde. These, Sir, are shrewd additions, And not, I hope, deserved. Sir Fleureant. They have been so: Had not contrition wash'd desert with tears, They were so still. I am that perjured Knight Fleureant of Heurlée. Artevelde. Art thou he indeed? What brings thee hither? Sir Fleureant. That which brings the proud To crave a low equality with dust; Which arms the lover lorn, the suitor cast, the sinner caught, The courtier supplanted, with the knife, Or bowl or halter—for their several griefs The sovereign cures. My Lord, what brings me here Is of that grain—a loathing of my life; And, to come closer, such a sort of grief As wrung Iscariot's heart when forth he went And hung himself upon the field of blood Has made me thus (in my Aceldama The sin of self-destruction partly spared) To run upon your sword. Artevelde. I am not bound To find thee in a hangman. Go thy ways! Thou art a slight, inconstant, violent man. Sir Fleureant. My Lord, I come prepared for your disdain, And slender were I in my penitence If I should not confess it well bestow'd. But light and fickle as you deem me, still To one fix'd purpose am I wedded now For better and for worse—'tis to repair The wrong that I have done you, and to die. Artevelde. Sir, you may live or die as likes you best; It is your own affair; to me all's one. The hurt your treachery has done to me Can neither be repeated nor repair'd. No further harm can follow from your life Save in the sundering of my time and thoughts From matters of more moment. Sir Fleureant. Pause, my Lord, Ere you pronounce me as inept for good As I am harmless. Slight me as you may, You cannot cast me in mine own esteem More low than where I lie; I scorn myself With such a bitterness as bars all taste Of other's scorn. But from this bitter tree Good fruitage, if so please you, you may pluck. I have been well esteem'd for soldiership, And none can better know your enemy's host, Where soft, where hard, where rotten, and where sound, Their hopes and fears, the order of their march, Their councils and intents. If all I know, With what small service I by deeds might render, May be accepted as a sacrifice My conscience to appease, I die content. Artevelde. Methinks I barely comprehend your conscience; For sicken'd with one treasonable poison, 'Twould seem to seek another for a cure. What says your conscience on your King's behalf? Sir Fleureant. It says that there all claims are cancell'd; yea, All ties dissolved; for never was a Knight Of prowess known, more thanklessly repaid, More scurvily entreated, than by him And by his ingrate uncles and his court Was Fleureant of Heurlée. Artevelde. Are you there! Ah! now I understand you. Come this way. My Council is awaiting me. Ere night I will speak further with you. Until when— Scene IV. —The Royal Pavilion in the French Camp at Mount Dorre, on the western bank of the Lis, at the distance of a league from Rosebecque. The King is discovered rising from supper and bidding adieu to his Uncles, the Admiral of France, the Lord of Coucy, and a number of other guests who are leaving the Pavilion. Sir Guy of Baveux is in attendance, and the Duke of Burgundy remains behind the others. The King. My Lords, we wish you all a sweet good-night. Sir Constable—he's gone—Sir Constable— Run after him, Sir Guy, and bring him back. [Exit Sir Guy of Baveux. Uncle of Burgundy, what says your Grace? Shall it be now? Burgundy. Fair cousin, now or never. [Exit. The King. He will be mightily displeased! I swear I have no heart to speak it! Me! I quake. Re-enter Sir Guy of Baveux with the Constable of France. We call'd you back, Sir Oliver; you heard not. Constable. Your Grace shall pardon me; my ears are dull; A blow was dealt upon my head at Nantes That something stunn'd my hearing. The King. Sir, the love We bear you is well-known; and for this night And for the morrow, out of love and grace, We would that you should tarry by our person And give your baton to my Lord of Coucy. Constable. Most gracious Sir! I am amazed at this! I do beseech you hear me. Well I know No greater honour can your servant share Than to help guard your person; but, dear Sir, Think how the van should marvel, were I missed At such a time! Sir, do not shake them so: Nor do not, I entreat you on my knees, Unsettle what advisedly was fix'd To be for your advantage. Be assured (I say it with all deference to such counsel As may have moved your Highness unto this) The parting from your purposes thus late Will put you in much peril. For myself I have perform'd my function with such zeal As doth not, I am bold to say, deserve That I should be degraded. The King. Constable, Your office you have well discharged, I know, In my time and my father's; 'tis the great trust And sure affiance that both he and I Have ever placed in you, which makes me speak To have you in this business at my side. Constable, Most noble Sir, you are so well begirt With valiant men, and all is so well sped That nought can be amended. Wherefore, Sir, You and your Council ought to be content. I pray you, Sir, maintain me in mine office, And if I err not, you will find no cause To-morrow to repent it. The King. By St. Denis, Good Constable, your pleasure shall be mine; So exercise your office at your will And I will say no more: for by St. Denis, You have seen further into this than I, Or they that moved me in the matter first. To-morrow come to me at mass. Constable. Kind Sir, Most willingly I will. God keep your Grace! All has been well disposed. The rear is up, Save only skeletons of squadrons dropp'd Upon our line of march: with tents and fires They make a show of forces left behind, So to beguile the Fleming, who will deem We are not whole. God give your Grace good rest! The King. Good-night, good Constable. To bed, to bed! Scene V. —Artevelde's Pavilion in his Camp on the eastern side of the Lis, as in the last Scene but one. It is night. Artevelde is discovered sleeping upon a low couch beside the embers of a fire.Elena enters. Elena. My Lord—Van Artevelde—up, up, my Lord! I never knew him to sleep sound before! Awake, my Lord, awake! Artevelde. Charge once again! Elena. Awake, Van Artevelde! Artevelde. Fall back! all's lost! Not by the bridge—no, no, no, no, no, no. Elena. Arouse yourself, Van Artevelde, awake! Artevelde (awaking). Elena, love, fly fly—Eh! what's the matter? Elena. Nay, start not—it is only my surmise, But I could deem the Frenchman was afoot. Artevelde. Why think you so? Van Ryk! what ho! Van Ryk! Elena. I could not sleep, and sate without the tent, And sudden from the river seem'd to rise A din of battle, mix'd with lengthen'd shouts That sounded hollow like a windy thaw. I look'd, and in the cloudy western sky There was a glow of fire, and then the cries Were less confused, and I believed I heard “Mount Joye, St. Denis!” “Flanders and the Lion!” With that I came to waken you. Artevelde. Van Ryk!— I'll go myself and hearken. Where's my page? Send for Van Ryk, I say. [He passes to the door of the tent. Elena. Courage, my soul! Play thou the heroine's part for one half-hour And ever after take thy woman's way. Artevelde. (returning). Who is within? Enter an Attendant. Bid them to sound my trumpet. [Exit the Attendant, and soon after a reveillée is sounded without. Then Van Ryk enters. Artevelde. What watch is this we keep? Here's battle join'd And none of us astir! Van Ryk. Not so, my Lord. Artevelde. Heard you not war-cries coming from the river? Van Ryk. 'Tis true, my Lord, both they that had the watch, And I myself, believed we heard a fight With shouts and hootings on the river's marge; But sending there, nought was there to be seen, Nought to be heard, nor was a Frenchman found. This thus made sure, we deem'd to rouse yourself Or waken up the host, should bring us blame; Wherefore we let it pass. Artevelde. 'Tis very strange. Van Ryk. It was as much a battle to the ear As sound could make it. Elena. Saw you not besides A redness in the sky? Van Ryk. Yes, a red light; But that was cast from fires beneath the hedge Upon Mount Dorre. Artevelde. This is a phantom fight. The ghosts of them that are to fall to-morrow (Rather to-day, for day begins to break) Rehearse their parts. Van Ryk, we'll sleep no more My trumpet has been sounded, and by this The host is half in arms. We'll sleep no more Till we have tried our fortune. Bid Vauclaire And Ukenheim and Roosdyk, when they're arm'd Meet me below beside the willow-grove. Bid silence to be kept through all the host. What think'st thou of the day? Will it be bright? Van Ryk. A mist is spreading from the river up: I think, my Lord, it shall not clear away Till sunrise, or it may be not till noon. Artevelde. That is all well. Send me the Captains thither. [Exit Van Ryk. I go, my fairest! Should I not return, There's nothing here that I shall leave with pain, My beautiful Elena, save thyself. What strange forgetfulness appears it now So many mis-spent moments to have given To anything but love! They're gone for ever With all their wasted sunshine! Now is left One moment but to spare, one word to speak; Farewell, my best beloved! Elena. Farewell, my Lord. Artevelde. And if we meet no more, a heart thou hast, Though heretofore misled, and like mine own Bedarken'd in the gloom of devious ways, Yet surely destined from the first by Heaven To issue into light. My shade removed, The radiance of redeeming love shall shine Upon thine after-life and point the path Through penitence to peace. Pray for me then, And thou shalt then be heard. Elena. Farewell, my Lord. Artevelde. And is it thus we part? Enough, enough; Full hearts, few words. But there is yet another I would not leave unsaid. If time be short To seek for pardon of my sins from Heaven, To thee and for my sins against thyself I shall not in the shortest sue in vain. For reparation of one fatal fault I would that I might be preserved to-day; If not, I know that I shall fall forgiven. Elena. Try me no further, Artevelde; go, go; If I should speak to thee one word of love I should not hold myself on this side reason. Go whilst I have my senses, Artevelde; Or stay and hear the passion of my heart Break out,—and not in words; if throes and shrieks Thou wouldst be fain to witness, stay; if not, Content thee with one bitter word—adieu! Artevelde. Dearest, be brave; no Fate forbids us yet To trust that we shall meet again. Take heart, And with a God-speed send me on my way. Oh! look, the Knight of Heurlée hither hastes To chide my lingering. Elena. He! He! I hate him. Why is he with thee wheresoe'er thou goest? It sends a very horror to my heart To see his fiendish face! Why is it he That comes to bring thee? Artevelde. What imports it? Nay, Elena, love, what ails thee? What is this? She hears me not—What ho! Cecile! Enter Cecile. There, take her. Cecile. She will be better soon, my Lord. Artevelde. Say worse. 'Tis better for her to be thus bereft. Go, take her in—nay, stop—one kiss—the last— One kiss—and not return'd—and not return'd— And on a brow so cold! but colder still Perchance may mine be when thy passionate lips Shall press it once again. Unhappy girl! The curse of beauty was upon thy birth, Nor love bestow'd a blessing. Fare thee well! Scene VI. —The western side of the Lis.—A watch-fire in advance of the French Encampment. Two Soldiers of the Watch. 1st Soldier. (sings). Four stakes and a mat Make a very good house: 'Tis ill found, quoth the rat; Not a whit, said the louse. 2nd Soldier. The Devil catch thy breath and stop thy mouth! The trumpets of the Flemish host may sound And nothing but thy caterwauling heard. 1st Soldier (still singing). More happy are we than the Count and the Earl, More happy are we than the gold-hatching churl, Than the Squire and Friar and seller and buyer, Than he that is high who still sees something higher: Your ear and I'll tell you The why and the wherefore— He that hath nothing, Hath nothing to care for. 2nd Soldier. Be still, I say; I hear a trumpet now. Hark! hush! now—there—a trumpet clear as day! Be brisk and handy; bundle up your blankets And hie we to the Captain of the watch. Scene VII. —The eastern side of the Lis. Artevelde, his Page, Van Ryk, and Sir Fleureant of Heurlée. Artevelde. The black flag hoisted! be it as they will. On our side too up with it! But, Van Ryk, Send Rutiler to the van with strict command To spare the King; he's but a boy. Van Ryk. Look, look, They gather on the left. Artevelde. Fly to Vauclaire And bid him when he sees me pass the bridge Drive on his force as though the Devil's self Were at his heels. [Exeunt Artevelde, Page, and Van Ryk. Sir Fleureant. He is at yours, my Lord. Scene VIII. —A rising ground, entrenched and strongly guarded in the rear of the French Host.—The King attended by the Lords of Coucy and Poictiers, the Bastard of St. Poule, &amp;c. Messengers arriving and departing. The King. Here comes another—well, Sir—tell me—what? Messenger. Sire, when Van Artevelde had cross'd the bridge— Coucy. What! cross'd the bridge alive? The King. Well, well; what then? Messenger. He poured himself upon the Breton flank, Which stumbled back a step, but rallied soon, Spurr'd by the Lords of Saimpi and St. Just Who hasten'd to the spot; and there it is That now the battle rages. The King. Ho! my horse! My Lords, do you your pleasure; it is mine To get upon my horse and take what's going. Poictiers. Your Grace should bear in mind—another! See! Enter a second Messenger. The King. Whence com'st thou? speak. Second Messenger. Sire, I was sent to say Van Artevelde was kill'd—so went the cry Where I was—on the right; but coming thence The knight of Saimpi did I jump withal Borne wounded to the rear, and learnt from him That Artevelde was living, proof whereof He bore upon his body, for his wounds Were got in fighting with him hand to hand. The King. My horse! I'll fight him hand to hand myself! Stay you, my Lords, or go; I mount my horse. Coucy. Have with your Grace! I cannot blame you much, Though you shall fret your uncles. The King. By St. Denis Rather than stay I'll fight my uncles too. Scene IX. —A part of the Field on the western side of the Lis.—Artevelde, attended by several Officers and Pages. Artevelde. Who's here? Fly, Sibrand, to the further left; Bid Eversdyk and Alphen wheel their force To prop me on my flank. [Exit Sibrand. Enter a Messenger. Run thou, De Roo— Messenger. Vauclaire, my Lord, is slain. Artevelde. Is slain—hah—slain— Thou to the rear, De Roo, and bid Van Ryk Keep open passage on the bridge. Thou, Paul— Enter a second Messenger. Second Messenger. Roosdyk, my Lord, is dying of his wounds. Artevelde. I cannot help it. Keep the causeway clear, And summon Reehorst to my aid. We shake. The cry is still, Van Artevelde is slain. Go make it known I live. Up with my cry! Scene X. —Another part of the Field still on the western side of the Lis.—The Duke of Burgundy, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée and Followers. Burgundy. Another charge like that—ill sorted knaves! They stumbled on each other, each by each Pegg'd in and pinion'd. Now they're loose enough. Another charge—they scurry to Mount Dorre. We'll drive them up the hill, and from the top Like a staved cask shall they be trundled down. What wait we for? Sir Fleureant. The cask rings hollow: yea, The wine is spilt that made their hearts so bold. Lo! yonder goes the King. Burgundy. What! breaking bounds! He must not be before us. Scale the hill. Scene XI. —Another part of the Field on the same side of the Lis, near the Bridge. Artevelde and Van Ryk. Artevelde. I bleed, Van Ryk. Can anything be done? For if there can, my spirit's sight is dimm'd And I discern it not. Van Ryk. To fly, my Lord, Is what remains. Artevelde. To fly! Then mount my horse And make away before the general flight Chokes up the bridge. Van Ryk. Not I, my Lord. Your horse Should bear his proper burthen: mount yourself. Artevelde. Never, Van Ryk. My errand upon earth Ends in this overthrow. Bind up my wound; Give me but strength again to reach the field And I will carve myself a nobler death Than they design'd me. God would not permit That I should fall by any hand so base As his who hurt me thus. Van Ryk. Whose hand was that? Artevelde. Sir Fleureant's: he stabb'd me on the bridge And fled amongst the French. Van Ryk. Oh monstrous deed! Artevelde. I hid it whilst I could, which was not long: And being seen so tottering in my seat The rumour ran that I was hurt to death, And then they stagger'd. Lo! we're flying all! Mount, mount, old man; at least let one be saved! Roosdyk! Vauclaire! the gallant and the kind! Who shall inscribe your deeds upon your tombs? May mine tell nothing to the world but this,— That never did that Prince or Leader live Who had more loyal or more loving friends! Let it be written that fidelity Could go no farther. Mount, old friend, and fly! Van Ryk. With you, my Lord, not else. A fear-struck throng Comes rushing from Mount Dorre. Sir, cross the bridge. Artevelde. The bridge! my soul abhors; but cross it thou, And take this token to my Love, Van Ryk. Fly for my sake in hers, and take her hence; It is my last command. See her convey'd To Ghent by Olsen or what safer road Thy prudence shall descry. This do, Van Ryk— Lo! now they pour upon us like a flood! Thou that didst never disobey me yet, This last good office render me. Begone! Fly whilst the way is free, Van Ryk. My Lord, alas! You put my duty to the sternest test It ever yet endured; but I obey. I do beseech you come across the bridge; This rush of runaways— Artevelde. Farewell, Van Ryk. Van Ryk. Fellows, stand back! What! see you not my Lord? Stand back, I say! Artevelde. Ho! turn ye round once more! Cry Artevelde! and charge them once again! What! courage, friends! We yet can keep the bridge. Three minutes but stand fast, and our reserves Shall succour us. Heigh, heigh, Sir! who are you That dares to touch me? Van Ryk. Nay, Sirs, nay, stand back. [Van Ryk is forced off by the crowd. Artevelde. Shame on you, cowards! what! do you know me! back! Back, villains! will you suffocate your Lord! Back, or I'll stab you with my dagger. Oh! Give me but space to breathe! Forgive me, God! What have I done?—why such a death?—why thus?— Oh! for a wound as wide as famine's mouth To make a soldier's passage for my soul. [He is borne along in the rout towards the bridge. Scene XII. —The same. Enter the Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon with Followers on the one side, and Sir Lois of Sanxere with Followers on the other. Sanxere. Halt ye a space, my Lords, ye cannot pass: The bridge has broken down beneath the weight Of them that fly. Burgundy. A lath should bear up us, We are so light of heart, so light of heel! It was the leaden spirit of defeat That brake the bridge. Shoot me a plank across And see if I shall strain it! Sanxere. Stay, my Lord; They're pushing beams athwart the shatter'd arch And presently the passage shall be safe For all the host; but farther down the stream There are some boats, though but a few, for those Who would be foremost. Burgundy. I am of them. Who else? Scene XIII. —A part of the Field on the eastern side of the Lis. It is strewn with the dead and wounded and other wreck of the battle. In front is the body of Van Artevelde. Elena is kneeling beside it. Van Ryk and one of Van Artevelde's Pages are standing near. Trumpets are heard from time to time at a distance. Van Ryk. Bring her away. Hark! hark! Page. She will not stir. Either she does not hear me when I speak, Or will not seem to hear. Van Ryk. Leave her to me. Fly, if thou lov'st thy life, and make for Ghent. [Exit Page. Madam, arouse yourself; the French come fast: Arouse yourself, sweet Lady; fly with me. I pray you hear: it was his last command That I should take you hence to Ghent by Olsen. Elena. I cannot go on foot. Van Ryk. No, Lady, no, You shall not need; horses are close at hand. Let me but take you hence. I pray you come. Elena. Take him, then, too. Van Ryk. The enemy is near In hot pursuit; we cannot take the body. Elena. The body! Van Ryk. Hush! Enter Duke of Burgundy. Burgundy. What hideous cry was that? What are ye? Flemings? Who art thou, old Sir? Who she that flung that long funereal note Into the upper sky? Speak. Van Ryk. What I am, Yourself have spoken. I am, as you said, Old and a Fleming. Younger by a day I could have wish'd to die; but what of that? For death to be behind-hand but a day Is but a little grief. Burgundy. Well said, old man; And who is this? Van Ryk. Sir, she is not a Fleming. Enter the King, the Duke of Bourbon, the Earl of Flanders, Sir Fleureant of Heurlée, the Constable, Tristram of Lestovet, the Lord of Coucy, and many other Lords and Knights, with Guards and Attendants. The King. What is your parley, uncle, who are these? Burgundy. Your Grace shall please to ask them that yourself; I cannot make them tell. The King. Come on, come on! We've sent a hundred men to search the field For Artevelde's dead body. Sir Fleureant. Sire, for that You shall need seek no further; there he lies. The King. What, say you so? What! this Van Artevelde? God's me! how sad a sight! Burgundy. But are you sure? Lift up his head. Constable. Sir Fleureant, is it he? Sir Fleureant. Sirs, this is that habiliment of flesh Which clothed the spirit of Van Artevelde Some half an hour bygone. Between the ribs You'll find a wound, whereof so much of this [Drawing his dagger As is imbrued with blood, denotes the depth. The King. Oh me! how sad and terrible he looks! He hath a princely countenance. Alas! I would he might have lived and taken service Upon the better side! Burgundy. And who is she? [Elena raises her head from the body. Bourbon. That I can answer: she's a traitress vile, The villain's paramour. Sir Fleureant. Beseech you, Sir, Believe it not; she was not what you think. She did affect him, but in no such sort As you impute, which she can promptly prove. Elena (springing upon her feet.) 'Tis false! thou liest! I was his paramour. Bourbon. Oh, shameless harlot! dost thou boast thy sin? Ay, down upon the carrion once again! Ho, guards! dispart her from the rebel's carcase And hang it on a gibbet. Thus and thus I spit upon and spurn it. Elena (snatching Artevelde's dagger from its sheath). Miscreant foul! Black-hearted felon! [Aims a blow at the Duke of Bourbon, which Sir Fleureant intercepts. Ay, dost baulk me! there— As good for thee as him! [Stabs Sir Fleureant, who falls dead. Burgundy. Seize her! Secure her! Bind her hand and foot! What! routed we a hundred thousand men Here to be slaughter'd by a crazy wench! [The Guards rush upon Elena; Van Ryk interposes for her defence; after some struggle, both are struck down and slain. Bourbon. So! curst untoward vermin! are they dead? His very corse breeds maggots of despite! Burgundy. I did not bid them to be kill'd. Captain of the Guard. My Lord, They were so sturdy and so desperate We could not else come near them. The King. Uncle, lo! The Knight of Heurlée, too, stone dead. Sanxere. By Heaven, This is the strangest battle I have known! First we've to fight the foe, and then the captives. Bourbon. Take forth the bodies. For the woman's corse, Let it have Christian burial. As for his, The arch-insurgent's, hang it on a tree Where all the host may see it. Burgundy. Brother, no; It were not for our honour, nor the King's, To use it so. Dire reble though he was, Yet with a noble nature and great gifts Was he endow'd,—courage, discretion, wit, An equal temper and an ample soul, Rock-bound and fortified against assaults Of transitory passion, but below Built on a surging subterranean fire That stirr'd and lifted him to high attempts. So prompt and capable and yet so calm He nothing lack'd in sovereignty but the right, Nothing in soldiership except good fortune. Wherefore with honour lay him in his grave, And thereby shall increase of honour come Unto their arms who vanquished one so wise, So valiant, so renown'd. Sirs, pass we on, And let the bodies follow us on biers. Wolf of the weald and yellow-footed kite, Enough is spread for you of meaner prey. Other interment than your maws afford Is due to these. At Courtray we shall sleep, And there I'll see them buried side by side. THE END</field>

The hog he munched the acorns brown Till joyfully twinkled his tail, And he twitched himself up and he tossed himself down, And he wriggled and reeled and galloped and squealed, As though he were drunk with ale: For you shall know that what by ale or wine To man is done, that acorns do to swine. Ah! it was so. Alack-a-day! so it was once. Enter a Forester. Forester. Grunt! grunt! No end to swine. Why, here's a herd! Beech-mast is scarce. Routing and grunting. Ho! Who's here? Swineherd. A sinful unconsolable man, The swineherd Ulf. Forester. Why, swineherds are but men, And man is sinful. Ulf, what grief is his? This is a world of ever-growing griefs. Swineherd. His grief, Sir, is a grief touching his swine, Which swine have lost their appetites. Forester. How so? Swineherd. The how, Sir, is a tale that moves to pity, And if you list to hearken, it was thus: Last Tuesday week, the vigil of St. Swithin, Up in the branches of an ancient tree, I perched myself for shade, and there the wind Rocking the bough and snoring in my ears, It so mishappened that I slid asleep. When I awoke my herd had wandered far, And far had I to follow, till, God's love! Belated in the dusky forest's verge I found them much amazed, a furlong's length, No more, from where the holy Dunstan dwells, Scourging his wasted body half the night, And wrestling with the Evil One. Forester. Wish you well! A tickle neighbourhood was that. Swineherd. “Out swine!” Quoth I, “ye villains, will ye run to the pit, And I to follow!” And with might and speed I drave them back; but volleying behind There came such howls as scared us to the heart, And to my humble thinking, since that hour We have not had that stomach for our food, That hearty hunger and that natural joy In eating, that we wont to have. Forester. Such howls! What howls? The Devil's were they, or were they Dunstan's? Swineherd. Sir, I have ears unskilful to discern Betwixt the twain. They might have come from either; For Dunstan his own back not less belabours Than he belabours Satan. Forester. Ay, 'tis true; A holy man is he and gives his life Simply to crucify the lusts o' the flesh And mastery over evil spirits achieve. But wist ye that he hurt the swine? Pooh! no. Not he. Swineherd. I know not. Forester. Thou say'st well thou know'st not, For thou know'st nothing; thou art an ignorant swineherd. 'Tis not thy swine alone; through all the land Swine have the murrain, dogs are sick o' the mange, Rot kills the sheep, and horses die o' the staggers; With rust and mildew droops the earing corn, Swarm orchards with the snail, gardens with grubs; And shortly, man and beast and herb o' the field Are stricken with a thousand plagues and blights Straight from the hand of God. Swineherd. Swine, didst thou say? Swine have the murrain! Is it come to that? Prithee, why so? Forester. It is but our deserts. To please the young, misguided, heedless King, Our monks of Malmesbury, those righteous men That ever were at work with book and bell Praying and fasting, and with thong and scourge Their flesh tormenting, have been rooted out, And in their place vile Seculars are planted, A hunting, dancing, and carousing horde, With wenches that they call their wives forsooth! Oh shame to clerks, that they should wive and bed And lead their lives so beastly! Woe is me! What but a curse could light upon the land When holiest men that wont to serve the poor With alms unceasing, beg their bread themselves, And lewdest prosper! Softly—stand aside; Here comes a nobleman, if we may guess By his attendance. Canst thou yet discern His cognisance? Earl Athulf, as I live! Enter Athulf. Athulf. Save you, good friends! How far may't be to Kingston? Forester. An hour, my Lord, or little more. 'Tis late, Or you might take the road by Warlewood Chase: 'Tis some mile shorter. Athulf. Being so, my friend, The lateness should be called a reason more. Forester. True, Sir; but it should lead you near the spot Where Father Dunstan for these three weeks past Nightly encounters Satan. Athulf. For myself I heed not that. Howbeit, that way wending, Methinks that my attendance would wax thin. Please you to show me by what devious path I may eschew the Devil and Father Dunstan. Forester. At your command, Sir. I will go before you. Scene II. —A Corridor in the Palace at Kingston. Odo, Harcather, Ruold. Odo. Earl Athulf come! I'll with you to the King. Harcather. You'll find your monasteries emptied out Under your nose, my Lord, at Sheen and Sion Ere it be long; and why you arm not now It passes me to guess. Odo. The Abbot, Sir, The Abbot listens to no mortal voice Except his mother's; and old Cynethryth Is fearful of divisions; for in her youth The splitting of the realm within itself Was wont to sound a summons to the Dane. And fetch him o'er the seas. Harcather. An old wife's tale. Odo. I'll bring you to the King, and testify That what you charge on Athulf and his house Is worthy of all credit. Harcather. Ruold, mark, I will thee not to loiter thus at court. Get thee again to Chester, son. Farewell. [Exeunt Odo and Harcather. Ruold. Father, farewell! and then farewell the court! To stay should but divide me from my friends By worse than distance; for my father's hand Is raised against them. Wherefore, fare you well, Good Athulf and Elgiva. Peace be with you. [Exit. Enter Leolf and Athulf. Leolf. Fair shines the hour and friendly to my spirit, That brings thee back. Welcome once more to Kingston! I would have said to court; but, by my faith! Far liefer would I to a cottage bid thee, Than such a court as this. Athulf. Court, cot, or camp, Hutch, hovel, let it be, or blasted heath, In shine or storm, well met! What ails the court? Leolf. Its old disorder, cynics say, made up Of ills, tho' diverse, not dissociate: Ambition's fever, envy's jaundiced eye, Detraction that exulcerates, aguish fear, Suspicion's wasting pale insomnolence, With hatred's canker. Athulf. To which add, no doubt, Monks for physicians. Leolf. There you touch a theme For large and leisurely discourse. To-night I will but say, the boldest of bold hearts Is hither come in season. Athulf. Say you so? Come cowl and crosier! With a cap of steel And battle-axe in hand, we will not fly. But softly for a season! In what current Runs the blood-royal? Are we where we were? Leolf. O'er the Queen Mother's mean and meagre soul Hath monkery triumphed; taking for allies Her past misdeeds and ever-present fears. Upon the Princess too I see it steal, And stain her pleasant purity of spirit. Athulf. But still the King is staunch? Leolf. Young, young and warm; Prompt in defiance, too precipitate; For we must have him crowned ere it be safe To cross them. But the passion which in youth Drives fast downhill, means that the impulse gained Should speed us up the hill that's opposite. How found you the mid-counties? Athulf. Oh! monk-ridden; Raving of Dunstan. Leolf. 'Tis a raving time: Mad monks, mad peasants; Dunstan is not sane, And madness that doth least declare itself Endangers most and ever most infects The unsound many. See where stands that man, And where this people: then compute the peril To one and all. When force and cunning meet Upon the confine of one cloudy mind, When ignorance and knowledge halve the mass, When night and day stand at an equinox, Then storms are rife. Yet once the King were crowned, We could face Dunstan; which he knows too well, And still by one thin pretext or another Defers the coronation, and his will The Primate follows. Athulf. Upon Edwin's head Before the crown must come the stout steel cap; Is it not so? Leolf. I see no other end; And therefore, Athulf, in a happy hour Com'st thou to Kingston. With our trustiest friends We'll counsel take to-morrow. All is ripe. You're strong in Wessex, and can thither send To hold your strength in readiness. Meanwhile Breathe not a word of menace; for at court The monks have eyes to see and ears to hear, Themselves nor seen nor heard. Athulf. Monks and stone walls, Since both of you have ears, I'll teach my tongue To say, “God save the King!” so whisperingly That only God shall hear.—A truce to Kings, To monks, to madmen; Leolf, at my heart There's something that sits closer. Guess you what? Or must I speak? How thrive you with my sister? Leolf. Indifferently. In sooth I hardly know. We'll talk of that—but by your leave, hereafter. Seek we the Chancellor now, and let your mind Put off its soldierly habiliments, And on its garb of policy, to meet The wise old man. Athulf. Off, idle hauberk, off! Off, clattering sword! off, greave and gauntlet!—There! Behold me politic. Old Clarenbald, A serious politician comes to council. Scene III. —Warlewood Chase. Evening. Dunstan (alone). Spirit of speculation, rest, oh rest, And push not from her place the spirit of prayer! God, thou'st given unto me a troubled being— So move upon the face thereof, that light May be, and be divided from the darkness! Arm thou my soul that I may smite and chase The Spirit of that darkness, whom not I But Thou through me compellest.—Legions vast, The mind's glad host for victory arrayed, Has thou committed to my large command, Weapons of light and glittering shafts of day, And steeds that trample on the tumbling clouds. But with them it hath pleased Thee to let mingle Evil imaginations, corporal stings, A swarm of Imps and Ethiops, dark doubts, Suggestions of revolt.—Who is't that dares— Enter Gurmo. Oh! is it thou? What saith my Lord Archbishop? Gurmo. He will be there. Dunstan. At Sheen to-morrow? Gurmo. Yes. Dunstan. And what my Lady the Queen Mother? Gurmo. Here To-night. Dunstan. I wished not she should come so soon. No matter—let her choose—to-night then be it. Go, get thee to the hollow of yon tree, And let none else approach. Gurmo. I'll howl and screech That any this way coming shall be scared And think the howls are Satan's. Dunstan. Get thee gone. [Exit Gurmo. And if thou howlest otherwise than Satan, It is not for the lack of Satan's sway 'Stablished within thee. [Strange howls are heard. Say then that they do— Say that they do hear Satan's voice in his, And prate of red-hot pincers and what not, And are they then deceived? Thou loose lay-priest, Thou secular lack-brain, No, I tell thee, No. Do I not warfare wage in very deed With Satan—yea, and conquer? and who's he Saith falsehood is delivered in these howls, If so it be that they impart to boors Truths else to them ineffable? Where's Satan? His presence, life, and kingdom? Not the air Nor bowels of the earth nor central fires His habitat exhibits; it is here, Here in the heart of Man; and if from hence I cast him with discomfiture, that truth Is verily of the vulgar sense conceived, By utterance symbolic, when they deem That met in bodily oppugnancy I tweak him by the snout; a fair belief Wherein the fleshly and the palpable type Doth of pure truth substantiate the essence. Enough! Come down; the screech-owl from afar Upbraids thy usurpation; cease, I say. [Gurmo descends. Await me in the border of the forest By Elstan's well. [Exit Gurmo. A sturdy knave is yon! He has transacted murder in his time, Yet will he walk in darkness through the forest Nothing discomforted nor scared. Who next? Ha! the Queen Mother! Enter the Queen Mother, in a Peasant's garb. Give your Grace good even! You are a faithful servant of the Church, And humbler weeds than these would gladly wear, And wilder solitudes, by night or day, Would seek to serve her. Queen Mother. Father, I am faint, For a strange terror seized me by the way. I pray you let me sit. Dunstan. I say, forbear! Thou'rt in a Presence that thou wot'st not of, Wherein no mortal may presume to sit. If stand thou can'st not, kneel. [She falls on her knees. Queen Mother. Oh, merciful Heaven! Oh, sinner that I am! Dunstan. Dismiss thy fears; Thine errand is acceptable to him Who rules the hour, and thou art safer here Than in thy palace. Quake not, but be calm, And tell me of the wretched King, thy son. This black, incestuous, unnatural love For his blood-relative—yea worse, a seed That ever was at enmity with God— His cousin of the house of Antichrist! Is it as I surmised? Queen Mother. Alas! lost boy! Dunstan. Yea, lost for time and for eternity, If he should wed her. But that shall not be. Something more lofty than a boy's wild love Governs the course of kingdoms. From beneath This arching umbrage, step aside; look up; The alphabet of Heaven is o'er thy head, The starry literal multitude. To few, And not in mercy, is it given to read The mixed celestial cypher. Not in mercy, Save as a penance merciful in issue, Doth God bestow that mournfullest of gifts Which pushes farther into future time The bounds of human foresight. Yonder book In mercy to the King and not to me Unfolds its tragic page. Is written there Something that must be, something more that may, But yet may be prevented. Queen Mother. On my knees, I pray thee, holy Dunstan, read not there Of ruin to my son. Dunstan. What there is writ Needs must I read; and if this wily wench That, profiting by the softness and green sap Of ignorant youth, doth round her finger twine The sceptre like a sliver— Queen Mother. Insolent jade! Were it not, father, a good deed in Christ To have her—in a manner . . . say . . . removed? For truly, truly I may say, my Lord, Yea and in sooth I witness it against her, That with her witcheries and wanton looks She hath inveigled and ensnared the King, Bewitched past reason, that he flouts his mother, Forgets his duty—woeful, woeful day! Says “Silence,” if I do but say “God bless him!” And all by her procurement and behest! Scandalous minion! Were it not, I say, An excellent deed and righteous before God To take her from his sight, that she should cease To vex good men and holy with her wiles? Dunstan. With thee the cry is ever “Kill and Kill.” I tell thee once again, my soul abhors This vulture's appetite, not more foul in act Than gross in apprehension. Look we round: In Wessex Athulf more prevails than we; Leolf in Sussex; which of us is first In Hampshire, hard to say. I tell thee, no; It must not be. Queen Mother. Or but to mew her up . . . Dunstan. Nay, that were worse; it were but to inflame By opposition the boy's passionate will. Be patient; meddle not with means; put trust In Providence, whose ways how knowest thou? Say that loose access to that girl were gained, Despite thy watch and ward, by that loose boy— What thence should follow is not for us to know; Nought, peradventure, that should thrive with her. In women's breasts the passions that are bred, Which for a summer's season work their will, As surely with the dangerous hour's approach Rise like armed Helots raging, and are found Of their worst enemies the best allies. With—with a woman's passions, not against them, He takes the field who wisely would pursue Her ultimate overthrow. Queen Mother. Most true, my Lord, Most excellently true! Dunstan. I bid thee not By either mean to practise to that end; I do but tell thee 'tis a patient part To stand aside in faith, nor put thy hand To work that is not thine. Queen Mother. Oh, man of God! Command me always. Dunstan. Hist! I hear a Spirit! Another—and a third. They're trooping up. Queen Mother. St. Magnus shield us! Dunstan. Thou art safe; but go; The wood will soon be populous with Spirits. The path thou camest retread. Who laughs i' the air? Ecce crucem, spargere lucem, Spiritûm Trias, pandite vias! The way is open. To St. Elstan's well I will attend thee, and there Gurmo waits. Scene IV. —A Chamber in the Palace. Enter Athulf and Elgiva. Elgiva. This is the chamber where the Council sits: I leave thee here: the very rushes bristle, Disdaining to be trodden by female feet. Athulf. To meet at eight, the summons said. By this They are at hand; but ere you go, one word. I see a trouble sit on Leolf's brow. Elgiva! Dear, dear sister! art thou true? Elgiva. Indeed I am. Athulf. And doth he know thee true? Elgiva. I trust he knows the truth. Athulf. The truth, Elgiva? These are short answers. Dost thou love him still? Elgiva. Sincerely and in truth and honesty Have I dealt with him always and do now. I verily believed I loved him once. I think I love him still. Athulf. You think you do! Who thinks she loves I think can love but little. Beware, my sister, that ambition's weeds Choke not the garden where thy love should grow. In Man of questionable quality Ambition hath been holden; but in Woman— Oh! 'tis the veriest beggary of the heart That winter ever witnessed! Elgiva. Athulf, no; A weaker to a stronger love may yield; But not in me will love or weak or strong Yield to ambition ever. Athulf. Oh, this head! So shapely and by nature so adorned! Far rather would I see the glossy braid Of its own golden tresses circle it Than England's jewelled crown. [An Attendant, who appears at the door, announces “The Chancellor.” Good-night, Elgiva. Said'st thou a stronger love? The strength of love is constancy. Farewell! As came the honey from the lion's carcase, So sweetness comes of strength. Beware, I say; Kings love like other men—or other boys: Not so they marry. [Exit Elgiva. Gone in anger! Well; Reproof that vexed not never yet sank deep, Nor ever of a warning that was welcome Came needful caution. Tush! a woman's wrath. And yet the very day that first we meet To send her from me angry! Tush! to-morrow— Had she but said, Good-night! [Enter Clarenbald.] Clarenbald. My Lord, well met! If I be late, let them that are to come Plead for me. Athulf. Nay, you do but prove it true That ever are the busiest the most punctual. Clarenbald. Sir, they have leisure. Only frugal men Are truly liberal, and for like cause Will he that husbands time have time to spare. Enter the King, with Earls Leolf, Sidroc, Alwine, the Bishop of Rochester, and two or three other Lords of the Council. Edwin. My Lords, we meet you here to be advised Touching our coronation. My Lord Chancellor Will set this thing before you. Clarenbald. My good Lords, What, if I err not, each of us with each Hath weighed in several conference, the King's Grace Commands me that I finally propound For your collective sanction. From the West Come tidings that the monks of Glastonbury (Doubtless apt implements of their Abbot they!) Have practised with Prince Edgar in such sort As hardly may decline the name of treason. Whilst they this child's simplicity seduce, Their brethren in the ignorant multitude Work a persuasion that the King not crowned Lacks half the warrant of his sovereignty, Which till the Pope through them shall please bestow, The kingdom is disposable. This creed Spreads day by day, and till the King be crowned Will daily breed new dangers. From the hands Of my Lord Primate, neither crown nor chrism By any instance can the King obtain: Wherefore, my Lords, our counsel to his Grace Methinks should be, that scattering like the sun All clouds of hindrance and delay, at once He should rise crowned, and on a summer's morn Shine in the feeble faces of the monks A consummated Monarch. Edwin. And his aid Will this true servant of the Church and State Afford us; [turning to the Bishop of Rochester] from whose pure and holy hands Much rather than from that disloyal Odo's Would we receive the crown. Bishop of Rochester. Most royal Sir, Much honoured were the See of Rochester, More honoured still were these unworthy hands, Should they perform the office. Edwin. Sirs, your votes. You, my Lord Heretoch, speak first. Leolf. The time Forces conclusions, and Necessity Sits in the seat of Counsel. Dunstan gains By every hour's delay. Should my will rule, The sun that sets upon St. Austin's Eve Shall see your Highness crowned. Athulf. All hail that eve! Dunstan would rather Beelzebub were crowned. Sidroc. And Odo when he washed the Devil's feet (Shame to him for his pains!) felt not his nose So sorely troubled as his ears will be To hear of this. Enough—St. Austin's Eve We're all agreed on. The Rest. All. Leolf. Then must all join Their speediest with their wariest endeavour To bring up forces. Clarenbald. To this end, my Lords, His Highness will provide you means to meet In cover of the chase your chiefest friends, And Wednesday he appoints a day of sport For hunting of the boar. He then with us Will lose himself, bewildered in the wood, And others that shall likewise lose themselves Shall find him, and in sylvan convocation Shall all consult together and concert The parts that each shall play. Edwin. Agreed. The Rest. Agreed. Edwin. Then for this present, trusted friends, we part. Scene V. —Another Chamber in the Palace. Elgiva and Ethilda. Elgiva. How is it I find favour in the sight Of the Queen Mother, and so suddenly? When I was last at court no word she spake Of welcome by herself, the King, or you. Whence is the change? Ethilda. I know not; but I know That but one change in you would work in us All love that you could wish. O sweet Elgiva, Restore yourself to God in His true Church, And stray not in that howling wilderness Where never is the voice of gladness heard, Of bridegroom nor of bride. Elgiva. But how is this? 'Tis you, not I, that in that desert stray. Except amongst the monks, I know not where The voice is silenced of the bride and groom. I pray you be not factious for the monks. The King and they are now as far apart As heaven and earth; did charity not forbid I should seek further down for opposites. Ask Athulf—ask my brother. Have you seen him? He came but yesterday. Ethilda. I saw him not. Elgiva. Oh! he is bright and jocund as the morn, And where is there on earth that wilderness Which he could not reclaim? No sandy waste Pressed by his foot, but what would teem with springs Of fruitfulness and joy. Ethilda. When last we met I was almost a child; but I remember How wild he was with pleasantness and mirth. I was gay then, although I seemed not so Beside his bounding spirit. Is he now Of the same temper? Elgiva. Not so thoughtless now, And more in broken lights; but Nature's flag Is flying still, whose revels in his heart Hardly can care suspend. Enter Edwin. Edwin. Oh, this is kind! You know not, my fair cousin, what a cloud Came over all the court when you were gone; No city churchyard could be more forlorn. Now we shall smile again. Enter an Usher. Usher. The Queen, so please you, Prepares for her devotions, and bade say She waits the Princess. [Exit. Ethilda. For this night, adieu. [Exit. Elgiva. Adieu, good night, sweet kind Ethilda! Edwin. Yes; Kind is she always; she is kind to stay Ever, when you are absent, by my side, And also kind to go when you are here. Elgiva. Your Highness. . . . . Edwin. Cousin! Are we not alone? Oh, how I hate my title in your mouth, Whence every other utterance is a charm. Rather than speak as in the audience-chamber, Let us be children once again, to rove O'er hill, through vale, with interlacing arms, And thrid the thickets where wild roses grow Entangled with each other like ourselves. Can you and will you those sweet days remember, And strive to bring them back? Elgiva. Those days—O Edwin! Can I remember? when can I forget them? When flowers forget to blow and birds to sing And clouds to kindle in the May-day dawn And every spring-tide sight and sound shall cease Or cease for me, then too for me shall cease The sweet remembrance of the tender joys, The smiles, the tears of those delightful days. Edwin. And can they not repeat themselves? Again Let us, though grown, be children in our hearts; Then with the freedom and the innocence Which led our childish steps we'll wander on Through after-life, but with a fuller joy. Let recollections of the past, if sweet, Plead sweetly for the present. Elgiva. Edwin, Edwin! You are a King. Edwin. Now, see! I wakened up By art of incantation from its bed A Spirit beautiful as break of day, The Spirit of the Past, and bade it speak, And prophesy and plead—and what response Is this it meets? None but the words of form The herald spoke, when o'er my father's grave He brake his wand of office. Yes, a King; But may not Kings be happy? Nor not love? Elgiva. Oh, they are most unfortunate in that! For when their hearts would rise from earth to heaven, Leaving low aims, which can but be through love, Then strangers intermeddle with their joy. And strangers such as those that circle you Are opposites to joy and love not more Than they are to all monarchy malignant. The monks are enemies that Kings may fear, Though of the bravest, and my father's house Is hateful in their sight. Edwin. Nay, talk not of them! I loathe this monkery, and if I live Will root it from my realm. Elgiva. Oh that you may! And earls not few and many a gallant thane Would gladly in that cause their hearts' best blood Pour our like water. Athulf is but one, Yet if you knew him is he many's worth. Edwin. If more of him I know not, yet that much I amply know. Then surely with his aid We may defy the monks, or better still We may forget them; ay, forget the world, Its cares, its kingdoms, and unbank the hours To that soft overflow which bids the heart Yield increase of delight. Beloved Elgiva, Your beauty o'er the earth a passion breathes Which softly sweeping through me, brings one tone From all this plural being, as the wind From yonder sycamore, whose thousand leaves With lavish play to one soft music moved Tremble and sigh together. Elgiva. What a charm The neighbouring grove to this lone chamber lends! I've loved it from my childhood. How long since Is it that, in the compassed window met, The blackbird sang us forth; from yonder bough That hides the arbour, loud and full at first Warbling his invitations, then with pause And fraction fitfully as evening fell, The while the rooks, a spotty multitude, Far distant crept across the amber sky. But hark! what strain is this? No blackbird's song, Nor sighing of the sycamore! Edwin. Some friend, As if the key-note of our hearts divining, Accordant music ministers. Hist! Hist! (A Song from without.) God speed thee, false day, With thy gauds and thy splendour; Thy glare frights away All that's truthful and tender: Give place then above To the star that of old Lit the glances of Love When his secret was told. Elgiva. It dies away. Edwin. It is but distant more. (Song resumed.) On the bosom of night Lie the tresses of truth, But its moments take flight With the light steps of youth. Make the most of the least, For too soon comes the warning, When announced in the east Is the grey-headed morning. Edwin. Come, follow it; but stop—let me leap down And help you from the window-sill. So quick! If you are light of foot as Atalanta You ought like her to give your Love the start. [Exeunt. Enter the Queen Mother and Dunstan from opposite sides. Queen Mother. So, well—so, well. It may be so, my Lord; But mercy on my soul! if she should prosper! Dunstan. To bed, to bed; 'tis late. Queen Mother. But if she should! Dunstan. The sky is clear; the air is still; the blue Of yonder firmament is pure and soft. God rules the night. Saw'st thou the falling star? Scene VI. —A Court in front of the Palace. Enter the Chief Huntsman, followed by other Huntsmen, a Bugleman, and Hounds. Chief Huntsman. What! none astir? Soho! the King lies long: Young blood, Sirs—ay, it tingles when it wakes, And yet it sleeps the soundest. Ranger! Churl! What! down, Sir, down! Oh, flatteries of dogs; We're courtiers all. Come, Uthric, where's thy horn? We'll sound them a reveillée. Bugleman. By the mass! I wheeze to-day as who cries, “Bellows to mend!” I'm out of breath with snoring. But no matter; Here is a puff on't left. [Winds his horn. Chief Huntsman. Why, so! that's well. Bugleman. Another whiff, then. Second Huntsman. Wake not the moon, I pray; 'Tis but a half-hour gone since she turned pale And went to bed. Third Huntsman. This dog is full of fleas. Second Huntsman. Excuse him; he has been amongst the monks. [Horn winds. Chief Huntsman. Who's here? Earl Sidroc. You are first, my Lord. Enter Earl Sidroc. Sidroc. I'm risen this hour; a snuff of the dawn for me! My nose doth love it better than a nosegay. Chief Huntsman. Right, my good Lord. You see her there, Sir—Elf; Oh, the best bitch! She holds them all together; Relay or vauntlay 'tis the same to her; Endways she runs it still and orderly. Sidroc. She is a good one. Sound another call. To make the King's dogs wait is less than loyal. Bugleman. Most true, my Lord!—I am not what I was! Plague of this asthma! Better have the mange! [Winds a recheat Enter Athulf, followed by a Page. Athulf. Set forward with the dogs—'tis the King's will. [Exeunt Chief Huntsman and his train. And hark ye, we shall hunt to-morrow too; Here—boy! Tell whom it may concern, to-morrow The King gives leave that I should ride Greymalkin. I'll wear my hunting suit of green and gold. See that Greymalkin is brought here betimes, For we start early.—Grace be with your thoughts, And peace with grace and joy be with your heart, Sidroc the sober!—Go thy way, my boy. [Exit Page. Have you a moral ready? Come, a moral. Sidroc. For what? Greymalkin, or the green and gold? Athulf. Neither—they serve—they come but second now— Appliance—means. Sidroc. No more—why, that is well. Athulf. Am I a coxcomb? Sidroc. Who can answer that? You were not yesterday; but lo! at court If but a man shall stoop his head a minute, Leaps a bespangled monkey on his back And grins at all beholders. Athulf. Oh, my soul! Be not coxcombical, I beg of thee! For I am lifted in mine own conceit, That is too certain. Sidroc. I lament your rise. But come—discourse it orderly; by what beck Of Fortune's crookedest finger were you led Up this ridiculous ascent? The King? Some special favour? Athulf. Pooh! The King is kind, But that is nothing. Sidroc. Nothing good, I grant you. The sun that striking in upon your hearth Puts out your fire, may yet too weakly shine Itself to yield you warmth: true, you say well, The King is nothing. What less chilling light Has beamed upon your fancy? Athulf. By my soul I know not that I shall not be ashamed To tell my story. As I went to court Late yesterday, the Queen, who saw me, sent Commanding my attendance. A long hour I waited, conning in the Troy-Town chamber The stories in the tapestry, when appeared The Princess, with that merry child Prince Guy. He loves me well, and made her stop and sit, And sate upon her knee, and it so chanced That in his various chatter he denied That I could hold his hand within mine own So closely as to hide it; this was tried, And proved against him; he insisted then I could not by his royal sister's hand Do likewise; starting at the random word And dumb with trepidation, there I stood Some seconds as bewitched; then I looked up And in her face beheld an orient flush Of half-bewildered pleasure; from which trance She with an instant ease resumed herself, And frankly with a pleasant laugh held out Her arrowy hand. Sidroc. What could she less? a hand To have and hold is something; but to hold And not to have—but end your tale—this hand— Athulf. I thought it trembled as it lay in mine, But yet her looks were clear, direct, and free, And said that she felt nothing. Sidroc. What felt you? Athulf. A sort of swarming, curling, tremulous tumbling, As though there were an ant-hill in my bosom. —I said I was ashamed.—Sidroc, you smile; If at my folly, well! but if you smile Suspicious of a taint upon my heart, You miss your mark, nor ever missed it more, Nor ever loved. Sidroc. No, no, I did not smile. Proceed, I pray you,—speak it; of this hand The issue in experiment? the proof? This lesser quantity—this in majore— Was it containable? Athulf. I proved it not. More manly, wise, and courteous I deemed it Not to press hard an opportunity Or wring it dry, but something leave behind In warrant that no greedy grasping heart Was mine, that on a trivial sign vouchsafed Feeding might grow in self-encouragement Too fast to fatness. Sidroc. I conceive your counsel: Not all devouring was your policy; Something you left for bait. Athulf. 'Twas not in craft. Sidroc. Your pardon; in myself it would have been; But let me not misjudge you by myself; For by a happy instinct are you led Unerringly and unsuspiciously, When timid craft, too wary to be wise, Would swerve for lack of blinkers. Athulf. Here's the King. Sidroc. And not he only!—Room, I say, make room. [Exeunt. Enter Edwin and Elgiva, attired for the chase. Elgiva. Remember that a King can take no step That is not measured by the rule and square Of some too curious eye that follows him. Edwin. We will be careful. Shall I tell you, love; The grim Archbishop came to me last night, And with him Dunstan; and, oh Heaven and Earth! They preached me dead! Elgiva. What was it that they preached? Edwin. What preached? A thousand things! They said my crown Was not a myrtle-wreath, and Kings were called, As fathers of their lieges, to affect All equally and favour none, nor loves Nor friendships ever to permit themselves Save as commended to their royal hearts By counsels grounded in State policy. Elgiva. Oh, insolence of churchmen! What a gift Of meddling is in monks? What answer made you? Edwin. I said, “Lord Abbot, and my Lord Archbishop, My crown, of myrtle whether it may be, Or as your hearts would have it, Sirs, of thorns, I wear not at your will, and with God's help I trust that I shall friendship find and love, Counsel and policy more kind and sage Than yours, my Lord Archbishop, or than yours, Lord Abbot Dunstan.” Elgiva. I am glad you spake So frankly and so nobly—glad at heart! Edwin. Lo! who comes here? 'Tis Dunstan, by my life! Elgiva. And who is he behind? Edwin. Gurmo by name. 'Tis a blue, swollen, unwholesome-looking knave That ever follows him as plague does famine. Elgiva. Let's seem to see them not and wend our way. [Exeunt Edwin and Elgiva. Enter Dunstan and Gurmo. Dunstan. Lo there! a lovely couple hand in hand, But which of them is male ... Seek out Harcather— Tell him the public letters I have writ Directing the disbandment of his force Import not present payment. It were well He muster them from time to time to take The guerdon promised, which, if I shall send The moneys, he may liquidate; if not, The fault is mine, and having not the means, He needs must put them off, but ever, mark, To some not distant day. Take horse to-night. Scene VII. —A Forest. The King, Athulf and Leolf, the Chancellor Clarenbald, the Bishop of Rochester, and divers Earls and Thanes. Clarenbald. To this then cleaving, let us bind ourselves By oath: so having in our hearts the will, There shall the conscience clench it. My Lord Bishop The oath administers. Leolf. This tree supplies The sacred symbol. [Breaks two twigs from a tree, and transfixes them crosswise with the point of his sword, which he then presents to the Bishop. The Bishop of Rochester (holding forth the cross to the surrounding Nobles, who kneel and bow their heads towards it). On Austin's Eve to crown your rightful King Ye swear! If peril of your lands or life Should stand between, ye swear of life and land To take no count; but putting trust in Him From Whom the rights of Kings are derivate, In its own blood to trample treason out, And loyalty in liberty to raise. This on this cross ye swear! All. We swear! We swear! Edwin. And now, my lieges, lords and friends, adieu! In very deed I thank you from my soul; For in your looks I read that not alone A common purpose joins you hand in hand, But likewise that confederate hearts are here. I thank you, Sirs; adieu! Clarenbald. Disperse yourselves In twos and threes; so severally seen You will not prompt suspicion. [Exeunt all but Athulf and Leolf. Leolf. Athulf, stay. I am for Sussex, there to raise my power. Athulf. Your Seneschal is there; what needs yourself? Leolf. Nor you nor I can longer blind ourselves. I am needed nowhere. Athulf. Leolf, on my soul What I do see I see with grief and shame. Leolf. Reproach her not; she's but a child in years, And though in wit a woman, yet her heart, Untempered by the discipline of pain, Is fancy-led. One half the fault was mine. A child is she; and look—upon my head Already peepeth out the willowy grey. My youth is wearing from me. Athulf. Nay, not so. Leolf. And youth and sovereignty, with furtherance fair Of a seductive beauty in the boy, What could they but prevail! Athulf. A child? No, no; And if she were, is childhood then so false? She is weak of heart. Leolf. No more. For Hastings I! No more—or, Athulf, but one word—but one— To her I would not say it, but to thee My friend in all fidelity approved— I—Athulf, she is gone from me for ever! ... But this remains ... I can devote my life To serve her and protect her ... broken hearts Have service in them still—Oh, more than strength Is in the sad idolatry that haunts The ruinous fane where lies a buried hope. I can adore her, serve her, shield her, die.... I pray you pardon me ... is shame no more? I should be silent; license have I none To either dotage—that of youth or age. Athulf. Oh, Leolf! oh, my friend! Leolf. Quit we the theme. But from my griefs and me this counsel take; Expend the passion of your heart in youth; Fight your love-battles whilst your heart is strong, And wounds heal kindlily. An April frost Is sharp, but kills not; sad October's storm Strikes when the juices and the vital sap Are ebbing from the leaf. No more. My men Shall stand in readiness; but for myself, Unless a martial opposition call, I would the King might please to pardon me If I appear not on St. Austin's Eve. Athulf. I'll say that you are shaken in your health: This shall suffice—I would it were less true. Leolf. You'll hear, and that ere long, my native air Has done its work restorative. Farewell. Scene VIII. —In the Palace. The King and Clarenbald. Clarenbald. How base to be so foolish! and again, How blind to be so base! By Jacob's staff, It made me young to see them; my old blood Sprang to my wrinkles, where it had not been These fifty years. One said that he was sick; Another's wife was dead; a third would go, But he must have a warrant signed and sealed. “Good carpet-knights!” quoth I, “not one of you Shall do this errand; for a fainting will, A gasping utterance, and a frightened face Shall not be bearers of the King's commands To Dunstan.” Edwin. You said well; no timorous heart Shall figure me in this. Clarembald. To do them right, They'd charge a Northman in his coat of proof And flinch not; but this shaveling's meagre face, With his mass-hackle and his reef and stole, Puts all to flight. Edwin. Lo! here's my cousin Athulf. Ask him to go. Enter Athulf. Clarenbald. My Lord, well met! The King Would wish his pleasure signified to Dunstan Touching his coronation. Some there be That blink the service, lest through sorceries And conjurations of the villanous Abbot A curse should cross them; but your brain, we know, Brooks not such vain bewilderments. Athulf. I vow Meat to my mouth goes not with better speed Than I upon this errand. Clarenbald. Excellent! Abounding with all fortitude of soul I ever knew you. Here's St. Tibba's thumb, A relic of much price, which ne'er till now Was parted from me; put it in your vest, And heartily we bid you well to fare. Scene IX. —A Corridor in a Monastery at Sheen. Two Monks. First Monk. He slept two hours—no more; then raised his head And said, “Methinks it raineth.” Second Monk. Twice he coughed And then he spat. First Monk. He raised himself and said, “Methinks it raineth”—pointing with his hand; And as he pointed, lo! it rained apace! Second Monk. Against such blows what body of mortal man Could e'er hold out? He's on the way to heaven Unless he deal more mildly with his flesh. First Monk. He raised his body—which is just his bones— Upon one hand, and crossed himself and groaned. And Father Bridferth met me in the court, And quoth he, “Hast thou seen the holy Dunstan?” I answered, “Yes, and on his wasted hand Red stains that spurted from the nightly scourge.” Second Monk. Nightly and daily, brother. At this hour He plies it for a double “De Profundis.” As I passed out— Enter Athulf, attended by the King's Jester, Grimbald. Athulf. God save you, holy Sirs! Is Father Dunstan here? Second Monk. My son, he is. He rose at five. I gave him his hair shirt. First Monk. At four he called for me and sate upright, And on his hand appeared— Athulf. I pray you tell him Earl Athulf, on an errand from the King, Would be beholden to his courtesy For some three minutes of his time. Second Monk. My Lord, Unless your business be of instant haste He hardly will bestow himself so early On aught of secular concernment. Athulf. No? But, Sirs, it is in haste—in haste extreme— Matters of State, and hot with haste. Second Monk. My Lord, We will so say, but truly at this present He is about to scourge himself. Athulf. I'll wait. For a King's ransom would I not cut short So good a work. I pray you, for how long? Second Monk. For twice the “De Profundis”—sung in slow time. Athulf. Please him to make it ten times, I will wait. And could I be of use, this knotted trifle, This dog-whip here, has oft been worse employed. First Monk. My Lord, we'll bring you to the room where stand The poor, whose feet he washes after penance, Whence you may see him in the oratory Plying the blood-stained lash. Tread softly, Sirs, For he were not well pleased were he to know That strangers' eyes beheld him. Scene X. —An Oratory. Dunstan, in a shirt of sackcloth, stained with blood, reclines on a pallet of straw. Odo stands near him. Two Choristers are closing their books. Odo. How farest thou, brother? Dunstan. Brother, weak in flesh But strong in spirit. Choristers, retire. [Exeunt Choristers. Brother, behoves us to compel our thoughts An instant from above, and on this world, Its temporalities and secular cares, Turn them, so long averted. Say, in brief, What tidings hear'st thou? Odo. Still a gathering round Of the King's forces, trooping to the call Of Rehoboam's councillor, rash Earl Athulf. Dunstan. Son of perdition, he affronts his fate! But there are more than he. Odo. At Hastings still Earl Leolf stands aloof; but holds his power In present preparation. Dunstan. Brother, lo! With blasting and with mildew shall they perish! With madness, blindness, and astonishment Shall they be smitten, the young man and the virgin, Terror within them and a sword without! One way against us shall their host come forth, And seven ways flee before us.—What is this? Athulf is heard without, singing: Sinks the sun with a smile, Though his heart's in his mouth, And night comes the while With a sigh from the south. Like them, Love, are you, In your coming and flying, For you smiled me adieu, And you welcome me sighing. Dunstan. What mumming knave is here?—Brother, I say, Their host shall flee; the anger of the Just Shall smoke against them.—Nay, again! What, ho! Grimbald is heard without, singing: There was a maid that was a jade, Four lovers true had she? One did so dote that he cut his own throat. And she poisoned the other three. Dunstan. What, ho! are we attended? Are there none To keep the precincts? Grimbald's song continued. From this we learn to see and discern, Nor hotly to desire A maid whose store of lovers is more Than her just needs require. Enter Bridferth (Dunstan's Chaplain). Dunstan. What vile noise is this Of juggling mountebanks that bellow and sing? Bridferth, Sir, the Earl Athulf, from my Lord the King, Accompanied by his Highness's chief jester, Expects the end of your observances, And entertains his patience. Odo. Insolent scoffer! Dunstan. The King hath sent him? Nay then, bring him here. [Exit Bridferth. Grimbald. (heard again). Up and away! We'll be merry to-day, For my father's in jail and my mother's gone gay. Odo. Attended by a jester! Is't not monstrous? The jester shall to prison, if not the Earl; He shall be whipped, and make a jest of that. Dunstan. Brother, not so. A grave occasion this, Which calls us to account and bids be still All outward flourishes of empty ire. Far looks the present hour and sees beyond A fertile future. Brother, in our brains, Not in our bloods, are we to seek the seeds Wherewith to sow it. Enter Athulf. Welcome, Sir, to Sheen! Athulf. My Lord Archbishop, and my good Lord Abbot, I crave your blessing. Summons from the King I bring you both, that you attend the court At Kingston, on St. Austin's Eve, to grace His coronation, and therein perform Each your fit function: then and there, Lord Primate, You shall anoint him King, and you, my Lord, As is your right, shall with the golden spurs Adorn and illustrate the royal heels. Dunstan. Sir Earl, all rights that in the Church reside, And in ourselves, at all times stand we prompt To exercise; and on St. Austin's Eve, Obedient alway to the King—next God— As He shall give us guidance shall we walk. Athulf. I will so say. The King expects your aid, But in default thereof, his head and heels Will punctually upon St. Austin's Eve Be otherwise attended. Fare you well! [Exit. Dunstan. Ho, ho! Sir Earl; say'st thou St. Austin's Eve? Look to thy sister! Odo. Nay, it shall not be. Dunstan. The wedding shall not; for the rest compound. If, as their wanton bearing seems to boast, It cannot be withstood, lo! give it way. This weakling, Edwin, from the arms escaped Of Ethbaal's daughter, the Zidonian quean, As amiably shall answer to our call As a tame culver. Odo. Were he but escaped! Dunstan. As with gross appetite he now enjoys (If insight fail me not) the all of folly, So shall we see him soon agape for change, Loathing his love foregone. Yield, brother, yield. Yet hold your force the while not less alert To answer each event. Be armed within, Be gowned without. Good brother, yield, but stand. ACT II. Scene I. —Leolf's Castle, in the neighbourhood of Hastings. Emma (alone). He walks upon the beach. A mind perturbed Shall find the sea companionable. His Is sorely troubled or my comment errs, That is not uninspired. Oh, dearest Leolf! You see not me with love-discerning eyes, As I see you, or you would pity me. When last I saw you, stately was your strength, And you are now a very noble ruin. Might I but be the wild flower on the wall Of that war-wasted tower! A weed, alas! But with a perfume.—Were I but at court Soon should I see what currents cross him there. The King? And if it be ... Here's my soft slave. Now to your work, my plotting, scheming brains, And I shall thrive. Enter Ernway. Well, Ernway, friend, what cheer? Ernway. I thank you, I am well in health. My heart Is heavy, as you know. Emma. 'Tis a good heart; But pitch me overboard this sand and gravel. With a light heart a meagre wit may pass; Or with a copious wit a heavy heart; But when the ship that's vacant of a freight Labours with nothing but the dead-weight ... Ernway. Hush! Although you love me not, you should not scorn me, Lest some day you be scorned yourself. Emma. 'Tis true; I should be gentle; and, good faith! I love you; Not amorously, I own, but amicably. You are a kind and most affectionate fool, And beautiful besides. I love your eyes, Your hair, your mouth, your chin; I love you piecemeal; I love your softness, gracefulness, and warmth; And putting you together, on the whole I like to see you at my heart's gate sit Upon a winter's day and toss you crumbs. Such is my friendship, and this many a day I have not taxed you for returns. But now ... Ernway. What can I do? Emma. What will you? Ernway. Nay, what not? If my weak wit, that you despise so much, Can compass it, I'll do it. Emma. Will you lie? Ernway. For you I will: I would not for myself. Emma. Thou art a virtuous youth and loving liar. 'Tis better than to be a lying lover; And yet not good—and would you not be good? Ernway. As good as you—no better. Emma. I your conscience! 'Tis much to have one soul to answer for! Yet will I make you sin. As good as I? I am a liar and a cheat. Now say— Will you be like me? Ernway. I have said I will. Emma. You will get nothing for it. Ernway. Not a smile? Emma. A smile at most—assuredly not more. Ernway. I am content to lie and cheat for that. Emma. You come from court. There's much of service there Is of that kind and in that coin requited. Now you will instantly to court again, And for the service you can do—'tis this, To take me with you. Ernway. I would kneel for years But for the blessing of a morning dream That told me you would ask me this in truth. Emma. I tell you, you shall do it. But there's more. Think not that I will let the word go forth That I have wandered from my home with you Unwedded. You must say we're man and wife. Ernway. And will you marry me? Emma. What, I? Oh no. Ernway. At last you will. Emma. No, neither last nor first. Ernway. Well, I shall fancy that you will; of that You cannot hinder me. Emma. Indeed I can; And if your fancy once should err so far I will disforest its demesne for ever, That nothing wild or free shall wander there; Dispark its parks, dismantle and destroy Its cloud-built castles. You are to present The shadow of a husband—nothing more, And this but for a season. Oh! my heart! Dear Ernway, I will not torment you much; And sooth to say, I'm sorry for your pain. To-morrow, for a sin you've not committed I'll teach you to entreat a false forgiveness. You must ask pardon of your worthy sire For a clandestine marriage. He will storm, But heed him not. There, you may kiss my hand; And now, I pray you, go. Ernway. Good-bye, sweet Emma. Emma. Call me “Dear Wife”—“Sweet Emma” is too loving; 'Tis an unmarried phrase; whereas “Dear Wife” Imports the decencies of dry affection. Ernway. No, I will say, “Sweet Emma.” Emma. What you will When we're alone. Come with me to the beach. Scene II. —The Sea-shore, near Hastings. Leolf (alone). Rocks that beheld my boyhood! Perilous shelf That nursed my infant courage! Once again I stand before you—not as in other days In your grey faces smiling—but like you The worse for weather. Here again I stand, Again and on the solitary shore Old ocean plays as on an instrument, Making that ancient music, when not known! That ancient music, only not so old As He who parted ocean from dry land And saw that it was good. Upon mine ear, As in the season of susceptive youth, The mellow murmur falls—but finds the sense Dull'd by distemper; shall I say—by time? Enough in action has my life been spent Through the past decade, to rebate the edge Of early sensibility. The sun Rides high, and on the thoroughfares of life I find myself a man in middle age, Busy and hard to please. The sun shall soon Dip westerly,—but oh! how little like Are life's two twilights! Would the last were first And the first last! that so we might be soothed Upon the thoroughfares of busy life Beneath the noon-day sun, with hope of joy Fresh as the morn—with hope of breaking lights, Illuminated mists and spangled lawns And woodland orisons and unfolding flowers, As things in expectation.—Weak of faith! Is not the course of earthly outlook thus Reversed from Hope, an argument to Hope That she was licensed to the heart of man For other than for earthly contemplations, In that observatory domiciled For survey of the stars? The night descends, They sparkle out.—Who comes? 'Tis Wulfstan's daughter. Enter Emma. Emma (to Ernway in the side-scene). Go now and bring my father.—Good my Lord, I fear you've fallen in love with solitude. Leolf. A growing weakness-not so tyrannous yet But that I still can welcome from my heart My pretty friend. Emma. I thank you, my good Lord. Leolf. You find me here discoursing to the sea Of ebbs and flows; explaining to the rocks How from the excavating tide they win A voice poetic, solacing though sad, Which when the passionate winds revisit them Gives utterance to the injuries of time. Poets, I told them, are thus made. Emma. My Lord, It is not thus through injury, I would hope, That you are made poetical? Leolf. Indeed There's much that has gone wrong with me, my friend. How wears the world with you? Emma. Truly, my Lord, I see so little of it, I thank God! That like a wedding garment seldom used It keeps its shine. Leolf. Why, then, the world wears well: But where's the wedding garment? Emma. Why, my Lord, 'Tis here—for I was married as you see me. Leolf Was married, say you? Emma. Yes, my Lord, last week; O' Wednesday, God forgive me! Leolf. This is strange! I pray you say to whom? Emma. Alack, my Lord! To a poor foolish follower of your Lordship's— Poor Ernway. Leolf. What! to him? Emma. For fault of better. Maids that are beggars cannot, you know, be choosers. Leolf. Well, if you like him I am glad you have him, And I will mend his fortunes for your sake. Emma. I care not for his fortunes. Oh, my Lord Your pardon! But I care for nothing now Save only this,—that you should break the news To my dear father, and on my behalf Crave his forgiveness; for he dreams not of it. Leolf. He will but dream when he has heard it. Still This life, and all that it contains, to him Is but a tissue of illuminous dreams Filled with book-wisdom, pictured thought, and love That on its own creations spends itself. All things he understands, and nothing does. Profusely eloquent in worthiest praise Of action, he will talk to you as one Whose wisdom lay in dealings and transactions; Yet so much action as might tie his shoe Cannot his will command; himself alone By his own wisdom not a jot the gainer. Of silence and the hundred thousand things 'Tis better not to mention, he will speak, And still most wisely.—But, behold him there! Led by your bridegroom, (is it not?) who now Runs back. Emma. Some fifty yards he has to come, And holding us before him full in sight, It may be he will find his way to join us. But lest he wander and forget himself, I will conduct him hither. [Exit. Leolf. Ernway! Him! Poets have said that 'tis the immortal mind And not the face or form that moves to love. They spoke as they would have it. Yet 'tis strange That such a maid should so bestow herself. But with her courage and her confidence, Her soft sagacity and ready wit, Mixes the woman's weakness. For the sire, He will but aptly moralize the theme, And then forget the fact. Enter Emma with Wulfstan the Wise. Wulfstan. For from his youth His converse hath been profitable; yea, In teaching him instruction made rebound And I was wiser for my pains. In truth, I have considered and have studied him With peradventure more of curious care And critical inquiry than befits A friend so inward; and I'll vouch for this, That though, as you have said, the vernal bloom Of his first spirits fading leaves him changed, 'Tis not to worse. His mind is as a meadow Of various grasses, rich and fresh beneath, But o'er the surface some that come to seed Have cast a colour of sobriety. For he was ever ... Emma. But, my dearest father, He stands before you. [Exit. Wulfstan. By my life, 'tis true! Well met, my good Lord and my excellent friend! My daughter warns me of some tiding strange, Surprising, unimaginable, by you To be delivered. Leolf. Strange it needs must seem; But should it grieve you, call to mind, I pray, The precept I have heard a thousand times From your own lips: philosophy, you said, If ministering not to practice, were more vain Than a child's rattle, for the infant's mind The rattle doth in practice hold at rest. Wulfstan. 'Tis true; for just philosophy and practice Are of correlative dependency, Neither without the other apt or sound Or certain. For philosophy itself Smacks of the age it lives in, nor is true Save by the apposition of the present; And truths of olden time, though truths they be, And living through all time eternal truths, Yet want the seasoning and applying hand Which Nature sends successive; else the need Of wisdom should wear out and wisdom cease, Since needless wisdom were not to be wise; For surely if... Leolf. The theme I have to broach Respects a certain marriage, which for my sake, Though it will certes take you unprepared, Yet you must leniently look upon And auspicate with smiles. Wulfstan. A marriage say you? My good Lord, I rejoice in your resolve. To marry wisely is to double wisdom, And breed a progeny of bright rewards, Which wisdom single, monachal or lay, Woefully wants. For think what it must be To watch in solitude our own decay, Jealously asking of our observation If ears, or eyes, or brains, or body fail, And not to see the while new bodies, brains, New eyes, new ears, about us springing fresh, And to ourselves more precious than are ours. But this it is... Leolf. I give you my consent That a wise marriage is the crowning act Which queenly Wisdom's sovereignty secures; For love is wisdom, when 'tis innocent: But for myself... Wulfstan. The season comes with you When love that's innocent may well be wise. But not inevitably one with wisdom Is innocent love at all times and with all. Love changes with the changing life of man: In our first youth, sufficient to itself, Heedless of all beside, it reigns alone, Revels or storms and spends itself in passion: In middle age—a garden through whose soil The roots of neighbouring forest trees have crept,— It strikes on stringy customs bedded deep, Perhaps on alien passions; still it grows And lacks not force nor freshness; but this age Shall aptly choose as answering best its own A love that clings not nor is exigent, Encumbers not the active purposes Nor drains their source; but proffers with free grace Pleasure at pleasure touched, at pleasure waived, A washing of the weary traveller's feet, A quenching of his thirst, a sweet repose Alternate and preparative, in groves Where loving much the flower that loves the shade And loving much the shade that that flower loves, He yet is unbewildered, unenslaved, Thence starting light and pleasantly let go When serious service calls. Leolf. 'Tis all most wise, And worded well. But you mistake my drift; 'Tis of your daughter's marriage, not of mine, I am to speak. Wulfstan. My daughter, my good Lord! Must she be married? Leolf. 'Twas her will to be; And upon Wednesday she gave it way. Wulfstan. Was married upon Wednesday! It is strange! She was a child but yesterday, and now A woman and a wife! On Wednesday— And unto whom, I pray you, was she married? Leolf. To one whose comeliness in woman's eye Excels the gifts of fortune that he wants; To one whose innocence in the eye of Heaven Excels the excellence of an erring wit: To Ernway. Wulfstan. You astonish me, my Lord. It is most strange; indeed, 'tis singular! She never mentioned it to me. Leolf. In that She missed of what was filially due To a kind parent, for which lapse through me She craves forgiveness. Wulfstan. I have lost my child! Leolf. Nay, nay, my worthy friend. Wulfstan. My Lord, 'tis so; She is my daughter, but no more my child; And therein is a loss to parents' hearts Exceeding great. Enter an Officer. Officer. My Lord, there's news from court; They seek you at the castle, whither is come Oscar, that's so much trusted of Earl Athulf, With letters. Leolf. Of what purport, did he say? Does all go well? Officer. To take his word, my Lord, They speak of nothing but prosperity. My Lord Archbishop, with a loyal will, Abets the coronation, in whose wake Comes my Lord Abbot Dunstan, his lean cheek Surprised with smiles. So smoothly runs the realm Missives are sent to each confederate Earl To bid his power disband; and these to you Are of that import. Leolf. Is it so? Oh, Athulf! Art thou not over-reached? I fear it much. Dunstan in smiles? A presage to be feared. I would I were at Kingston with my power. Conceive you what this smiling may portend? Wulfstan. You read it as the scholiast of mankind Should ever read their acts, conjunctively, Interpreting the several by the whole. Leolf. Then, Hederic, we will expedite the levies. The daylight's lengthened by yon rounding moon. Long marches and short nights—and so to Kingston. Scene III. —Kingston. A Chamber leading to the Banqueting Hall in the Palace.—The Dish-Thane passes through, followed by other Officers of the Household, by Attendants bearing dishes, and by the Female Cup-bearer. In the back of the scene are a motley crowd, consisting of Musicians tuning their instruments, Two Fortune-tellers, Heida and Thorbiorga; Grimbald, the King's Jester; Bridferth, Dunstan's Chaplain; a few Monks and secular Priests, several Thanes of the second rank, Ceorls and Soldiers. The Persons of the scene are in constant movement, changing their situations or passing in and out, some eagerly, others idly. Once or twice an Earl or Ealderman passes through, but without stopping or mixing with the crowd, which reverently makes way. The parties who are heard to speak are those who pass in front or pause there. 1st Monk. So! crowned at last! God's will be done! At times His will it is, for ends best known to Him, To grant a holiday to Beelzebub, And there is feasting and a dance in Hell. 1st Soldier. In the north aisle was I and saw it all. 2nd Soldier. The bailiff (curse him!) broke my head with his staff Or I had got there too. 1st Soldier. Most royally His Highness played his part from first to last, And graciously and grandly. At the Abbot Methought he looked askance, but with the rest... [They pass. 1st Monk. In the south aisle. He faltered as he swore To keep the Church in peace. 2nd Monk. His cheek was pale. 1st Monk. It was as white as leprosy. Bridferth. No marvel, For such an eye was on him in that hour As smote Gehazi. [They pass. A Thane (who advances in company with a Scholar). Hark ye! are we blind? The Princess was led in by brave Earl Athulf; And didst thou mark the manner of it, ha? Scholar Methought she leaned upon him and toward him With a most graceful timid earnestness; A leaning more of instinct than of purpose, And yet not undesigned. But think you then... [They pass. Heida (sings to a harp). She was fresh and she was fair, Glossy was her golden hair; Like a blue spot in the sky Was her clear and loving eye. He was true and he was bold, Full of mirth as he could hold; Through the world he broke his way With jest and laugh and lightsome lay. Love ye wisely, love ye well; Challenge then the gates of Hell. Love and truth can ride it out, Come bridal song or battle shout. 1st Priest. Our gallant Heretoch, the good Earl Leolf, Should have been there methought. 2nd Priest. He should have been; But there are reasons, look ye,—reasons—mum— Most excellent reasons—softly—in your ear— [They pass. Thorbiorga (sings). He stood on the rock, And he looked on the sea, And he said of his false Love, “My Love, where is she? “Have they bought her with bracelets And lured her with gold? Is her love for her lover A tale that is told? From the crest of the wave, In the deep of the gulf, Came a voice that cried, “Save! For behold the sea-wolf!” He stood on the rock, And he looked at the wave, And he said, “Oh, St. Ulfrid! Who's this that cries, Save!” Then arose from the billow A head with a crown, And two hands that divided The hair falling down. As the foam in the moonlight The two hands were fair, And they put by the tangles Of seaweed and hair. He knew the pale forehead— A spell to his ear Was the voice that repeated, “The sea-wolf is here!” “I come, Love,” he answered:— At sunrise next day A fisherman wakened The Priest in the Bay: “For the soul of a sinner Let masses be said— The sin shall be nameless, And nameless the dead.” Enter the Great Chamberlain with the Horse-Thane and other Officers of the Household. Great Chamberlain. His Highness! Ho! Make way His Highness! Ho! Sound trumpets! [A flourish of trumpets. [The King, wearing his Crown, and leading in the Queen Mother, passes across the back-scene, and is followed by Earl Athulf, leading in Ethilda, by Odo and Dunstan, with Sigeric and Bridferth, by Harcather, Ceolwulf, Æthelric, Eadbald, Ida, Brand, Ecfrid, Gorf and Tosty, all military leaders on the Monastic side; and by Clarenbald, Earl Sidroc, the Bishop of Rochester, and divers great Officers of State and Nobles of the King's party. The procession, when it passes off, enters the Banqueting Hall. 1st Ceorl. The King stepped proudly. 2nd Ceorl. But his countenance Methought was troubled. Is he well in health? 1st Ceorl. Now comes the Primate. 2nd Ceorl. What, can this be he That looks so fierce and haughty? Once before I saw him, when a cripple asked for alms; So lowly of demeanour was his Grace, I had not known, but for the mitred head, Which was the beggar, which the Lord Archbishop. 1st Ceorl. He's humble to the poor to spite the rich; Give me the man that's humble to his peers. 2nd Ceorl. There's Dunstan. 1st Ceorl. What, is yonder thing alive? Grimbald (the Jester, who has come up behind). Sir, he's aboveground. 2nd Ceorl. So we see, my friend. Grimbald. For this occasion, Sir. A hole i' the earth Is where he lives, Sir, mostly: yea, his life Is of the earth, Sir, earthy. 1st Ceorl. It was there That he encountered Sathanas. Grimbald. 'Twas there. The Devil, Sir, one day, grubbing for earth-nuts— A simple fare you'll say, but for his ends The Devil you'll find can be a very hermit— Digging and grubbing—what should his old claws clutch But Father Dunstan's skull! “Ho, ho!” cried he, “A bigger one than ever;” but thereat... Oh mercy! here is Gurmo!—Sirs, I say, The feasting and the singing and the dancing Should carry us to midnight—Cockadoodle! A song will I sing Of an excellent King That carried his crown where a bee has her sting. Enter from the Banqueting Hall Two Ushers. 1st Usher. The third cup has gone round. You're welcome now To take your places at the lower board. Grimbald. In, tag-rag—enter, rabblement—in, all! And to him the Queen said, “Sure your senses are fled, Put your boots in that place and your crown on your head.” In, dregs; in, scum; in, commonalty, in! In, many fools by nature, one by name! [Exeunt into the Banqueting Hall, all but the Ushers and the Scholar. 1st Usher. The Princess and a certain Earl sit close. Scholar. Ah! she is peerless! Happy were the man That should enthrall her though she were a peasant! What in another might have seemed amiss In her was but a freshness and new charm Loosed from the graceful nakedness of nature. She ate but half a pigeon, and did you mark How with her tiny fingers and her teeth She gnawed and tore the bones, talking 'twixt whiles, With such a lively and a pretty action, That appetite itself and all its ways Seemed mainly spiritual. 2nd Usher. Hush! Hark to that! [A flourish of trumpets. 1st Usher. The ladies leave the board. Scholar. I'll see her go. She ever moves as if she moved to music. Are you not wanted? Oh! what's like to her? Scene IV. —A Chamber in the Palace. Enter Emma. Emma. Credentials? yes—Earl Leolf's may go far; But truly I was made to thrive at court With or without them, being merry and wise. They trust to me already as to one That works by miracle; and can I not To clear the proud Elgiva from the path Of lovelorn Leolf? Married shall she be Or e'er the sun go down; so shall his wound, Though deep, have rest and heal. Could twenty Kings Have turned aside my heart, or in mine eyes Possessed one-twentieth part the sovereignty That crowns his kingly head! Enter Ernway. In time for once. Take this to Sheen. Seek Father Ricola out; Tell him the King shall follow in an hour, And then Elgiva.—Ernway, if thou lov'st me, Be sudden and be secret. Ernway. Trust me, Emma, I will be both. Emma. Here is the private stair Which brings you past the ward, and with this key ... How dark it is! Be careful how you step. Scene V. —The Banqueting Hall.—Are seated at the board, all the Male Guests who passed through in the Third Scene. But the King's place is vacant. Goblets are passed from hand to hand. Grimbald the Jester stands behind the chair of state. Harcather. Comes not the King again? Ceolwulf. Surely he will. Tosty. He will! Nay, nay, he must. Dunstan. Content yourselves; It cannot be but he will come again. He cannot mean us such disparagement As thus, and at this high and solemn feast, To quit his guests, the noblest of the land, Without a “God be with you,” or a word To sheathe the sharp directness and the sting Of such a plain offence. Ida. 'Twere good, my Lords, We sent our humble duty to the King, Craving his expedite return. Great Chamberlain. Grith, Offa, Go seek the King; and say his noble guests Find themselves by his absence overcast As with a cloud, and crave his swift return. [Exeunt Grith and Offa. Grimbald. Betwixt the new ship and the headland old The dolphins ducked and the waters rolled. Worse and more of it! the wind went mad— But the pilot he drank no more than he had. Tosty. Peace, fool! The very hour that he could spare us... Ceolwulf. A singular and unadvised retreat. Tosty. I say if one of us—I say if I... Sidroc. Well, well, he's young. Tosty. I say, my Lords, if I, Not being sick nor drunk, jump from my seat, And turn on this illustrious company My back, that is not comelier nor more pleasant Nor acceptabler than another man's, Why, then, my Lords, let me be who I may, I say I offer to this company, Not being drunk, a strange discourtesy, And quite the obverse of a salutation. Æthleric. Bear this, and we shall. Clarenbald. Tut! he'll come again. Pass round the goblet. Eadric, take the harp, And sweeten our carouse with minstrelsy. SONG. In the hall of Leodwulf was made good cheer; On the board was a bowl, by the wall was a spear; The spear and the bowl looked each at each, And the thoughts that rose in them wrought to speech. Bowl. Thou in the corner so grim and spare, Who sent thee hither? What dost thou there? Spear. I came of the ash-tree Ygdrasil, And do her bidding for woe or weal. Bowl. For whom the weal, for whom the woe? Spear. Say who thou art, and thou shalt know. Bowl. Broach the cask and fill me full— I am the bold Logbrogdad's skull. Spear. Thou liest, or else thou leak'st; for once I pierced the bold Logbrogdad's sconce. Bowl. I neither lie nor leak. Behold! The hole is here and pieced with gold. Spear. I pray thee grace. 'Twas through that hole Passed out the bold Logbrogdad's soul. Bowl. Then answer make that all may know, For whom the weal, for whom the woe? Spear. The weal is their's who do no wrong, And crown with gifts the sons of song. The woe is theirs who fain would flood Their father's land with brethren's blood. Their deeds the eagle and the kite Shall judge, and God shall guard the right. [Re-enter Grith and Offa.] Great Chamberlain. How now? Offa. My Lords, his Highness greets you well. He bids us say that he has calls elsewhere, And loves not too much quaffing, which is wont To leave you with less reason than the beasts, Rolling upon the floor. Wherefore, my Lords, He prays you with all love and courtesy To hold his Grace excused, for he is young, And loves not quaffing. Odo. Will ye suffer this? If rated thus for nothing, what's your fate When standing for your liberties ye check him? If thus affronted at the festive board, What in the Witenagemót awaits you? Tosty. He loves not quaffing! Harcather. Rolling on the floor! Athulf. Sirs, for his Highness's too hasty message, I grant it ill-advised; but, Sirs, his youth, If ye will temperately consider . . . Harcather. Youth! Hath youth a privilege to maltreat the old? Ecfrid. He loves not quaffing! Ah, my good Lord Athulf, But what else loves he? There are sins beside. Say he had left us for a lady's bower— There is a revelling he impugns not. Dunstan. Ha! Ecfrid. What lady she may be, my good Lord Athulf, Concerns not us. Odo. Ho! some of you go forth And seek the King, and say to him from me That he, or willingly or not, perforce Must instantly return; and see ye bring him. Athulf. Whoso shall take that errand from this hall, Let him take that therewith. [Throws his glove on the floor. Three or four Earls start up in their seats. In the mean time Gurmo has entered, and spoken apart to Dunstan. Dunstan (rising). My Lords, sit still. I'll bring the boy myself. Here, varlets, sweep this litter from the floor. [Spurns the glove with his foot as he passes and exit. Athulf. (his hand on his sword). Which of you here that wears not frock nor hood Will this vile Abbot's vilest act avouch? Several Earls of the Monachal party lay their hands on their swords and spring upon the floor. The company rises in disorder. Seneschal. Peace, ho! My Lords, bethink ye where ye are; He that within the palace draws his sword Doth forfeit an Earl's were. Peace, peace, be still! Keep the King's peace! Harcather. Not I, for one. Tosty. Nor I. Others. Nor I; nor I. Seneschal. Then who will keep it not Let him withdraw, and not pollute with blood The precincts of the palace. Eadbald. Then withdraw. Many voices. Withdraw! withdraw! Harcather. Keep the King's peace? If longer than three minutes I keep it, may I die in my bed like a cow! Scene VI. —An Apartment leading to an Oratory in the Royal Residence at Sheen.—As the scene opens, Edwin and Elgiva are discovered before the altar in the Oratory, and Ricola, the King's Chaplain, is joining their hands. They all three then advance out of the Oratory to the front. Ricola. So be ye one from this time forth for ever, And God for ever be your gracious guide In love and peace to live! A hasty rite Hath solemnized your nuptials; not the less Be ye observant of the sacred bonds Wherein ye stand contracted for all time. My Sovereign Lord and Lady, ye are young, And these are times and yours beyond compare Stations of trial: Be ye each to each Helpful, and fullest of comfort, next to God. And so, my blessing poured in tears upon you, I bid you well to fare. Edwin. My honoured friend, We thank you for this service, one of many, But of the many greatest. For awhile Our secret kept, the Queen abides with you. I must return to Kingston; but ere night Once more you'll see me here. Farewell till then. Shortly the Queen shall follow you. [Exit Ricola. Elgiva! Oh, past expression beautiful and dear, And now my own for ever! Let my soul Be satisfied, for 'tis a joy so great To know you mine, that nature for my bound Seems insufficient, and my spirit yearns Intent with you to pass from this pale earth Into that rosy and celestial clime Where life is ever thus. Elgiva. How joy fulfilled Makes the heart tremble! Now no change can come That is not to be feared. Re-enter Ricola. Ricola. My Lord, my Liege, Forgive me—but I fear . . . I'm old, my Lord, And shake at trifles, but I strangely fear That mischief is afoot. Edwin. At Kingston? Ricola. There, And coming hitherward; the poor fool Grimbald Came flying like the scud o' the storm before To warn you. Edwin. And what says he? Call him in. [Ricola goes to the door and returns with Grimbald. Well, my good fool, and what hast thou to tell? Grimbald. There was grace after meat with a fist on the board And down went the morat and out flew the sword. Elgiva. Truce to thy calling for a while, good fool, And tell us plainly what befell. Grimbald. By the ears The nobles went together; in the fray The Horse-Thane and the Dish-Thane were o'erborne And sent to prison. Then I took to my heels To bring you word. Elgiva. Earl Athulf? Where is he? Grimbald. He stood against Harcather hand to hand When I departed; but I know no more. Enter the Queen Mother. Queen Mother. So you are here, my son, and Madam, you! And is it for this you scurry from your place? Is it for this you quit your noble guests? Is it for this you vex the kingdom? Yea, To shedding of blood—for there has blood been shed— For nought but this? Oh, fie! for dalliance—oh! And whiles you waste the hours in wantonness . . . Edwin. Good mother, speak of what you know. Not here Was either wantonness or waste of time. You little think how little idly spent Has been the hour that's gone. Queen Mother. How spent? oh, son! But here come those can speak. Lo! here they come! Enter Dunstan and Odo,with two or three Thanes following, who are gradually augmented as the scene proceeds till the stage is filled with Dunstan's adherents. Ricola. Will't please you to withdraw? Elgiva. I thank you, no. Edwin. You are too bold, my Lord Archbishop; hence! Go hence, and trouble not my privacy. When I did leave you 'twas my will to leave you. Am I your King, or am I not? Odo. Sir, Sir, 'Tis true, with suffrage of the Witena You were anointed with the holy oil And crown'd this day by me. But deem not thence That you are free to spurn us. Rather deem That calls more urgent, bonds of stricter claim, Enjoin the duties of your sovereignty; Amongst which duties eminently first Is this, that when your Lords and Councillors, The pillars of the realm, in conference meet, You should be with them, wisely there to learn From the assembled wisdom of the State. Edwin. 'Twas for carousal, not for conference, They met to-day. Dunstan. Sirs, stand ye all apart And suffer that I reason with the King, Whose youth betrays him. Oh, unruly flesh! Oh, wanton blood of youth! the primal sin! The first offender still! The original snare! Perdition came of Woman, and alway since When Time was big with mischief and mischance He felt his forelock in a soft white hand. Elgiva. Of Woman say'st thou that perdition came? 'Twas of the Serpent, Priest. Queen Mother. What, break'st thou in? Thou bold and naughty jade! Thou pit! thou snare! Edwin. Oh, mother, hold! Know you at whom you rail? Deem her your daughter or me not your son. Queen Mother. Thou art not and thou shalt not be my son. If thou demean'st thyself to her—a witch! A practiser of sorceries! Edwin (kneeling). Oh, God! I pray Thee that Thou shorten not my days, Ceasing to honour this disnatured flesh That was my mother. Elgiva. Never was she that: O Edwin, had God granted thee a mother, What honour had we rendered her! Dunstan. Thou darest! And seest thou in what presence? Be thou warned! Thy witcheries that inflame this carnal King Far other fires shall kindle in the Church— The channel as of mercies, so of wrath. Thou stand'st before its excellent Archbishop, And me its humblest minister; men both Dead to the flesh and loathing from their souls To company with women. To us thy charms Are flat and futile as thy sins are sharp And spur us to that vengeance God inflicts Through us on scorners. Edwin. Heed them not, Elgiva. Elgiva. Content thee! never were they heeded less By God or by His Angels than by me. Edwin. Insolent Churchmen! You renounce the world! All in it that is loving or can be loved You'll teach yourself and others to renounce, Because cold vanities with meagre heats Alternate have consumed you to the core And given your hearts the dry-rot. Meddlesome monks! The love it is not in you or to feel For women or from womankind to win You ostentatiously deny yourselves, As atrophy denies itself to fatten. Elgiva. What worth are you to us, that set no store By you or by your threats? I tell thee, Priest, I make no more account of thee and thine Than of so many kites and crows. Dunstan. Fly hence, Pale prostitute! Avaunt, rebellious Fiend Which speakest through her! Edwin. And I tell thee more, She is thy Sovereign Mistress and thy Queen, My lawful wedded wife. Queen Mother. Ah, woe is me! Odo. Thy lawful wife! How lawful? By what law? Incest and fornication! Dunstan. Who art thou? I see thee and I know thee-yea, I smell thee! Again 'tis Satan meets me front to front, Again I triumph! Where, and by what rite, And by what miscreant minister of God And rotten member, was this mockery, That was no marriage, made to seem a marriage? Ricola. Lord Abbot, by no . . . Dunstan. What then, was it thou? The Church shall cut thee off and pluck thee out! A Synod shall be summoned! Chains for both! Chains for that harlot and for this dog-priest! Oh, wall of Jezreel! Edwin. Villains, stand ye back! Stand from the Queen . . . Oh, had I but a sword! What—felons! Ye shall hang for this ere long— Loose me or I will . . . Odo. Sir, be calm, and know 'Tis for your own behoof and for your crown's. Elgiva. Be of good comfort, Edwin; we shall meet Where none can part us. Are ye men? Hold off! I will not put you to that shame to force me. [She is taken out. Odo. Thou Queen! Go, get thee gone! A crown for thee! No, nor a head to put it on to-morrow. Queen Mother. Alack! the law is sharp. But, Gurmo, run, See she have Christian burial; speed thee, Gurmo. Dunstan. Madam, your pardon. Gurmo, wait on me. Edwin. Elgiva, oh, Elgiva! Oh, my wife! I'll find thee friends, though now . . . Oh, traitors! slaves! When I have raised my force, I'll bring you bound With halters round your necks, to lick the dust Before her footstool. I will have you scourged By hangmen's hands in every market town— Yes, you, my Lords!—And, mother, oh! repent, Or I shall cast thee off and curse the fate That made thy hateful womb my habitation Ere my blind soul could choose. Perfidious monk! Smilest thou, villain! But I will raise a force . . . [Exit. Dunstan. Lord Primate, thou hast crowned a baby's brow. May it please you follow lest he come to harm. [Exit Odo. Friends, quit not my Lord Primate. Follow all. [Exeunt all but Harcather, who stays behind on a sign from Dunstan. Harcather, haste; convey Elgiva hence With speed to Chester, and in strictest ward Confine her there; but keep her life untouched. [Exit Harcather. So shall we brandish o'er the enamoured King A trenchant terror.—See we next what friends Will stead us in the Synod.—Break, thou storm! And learn thou which is strongest, thou or I. ACT III. Scene I. —The Castle at Tonbridge.—Leolf's Army encamped around it. Oscar and Leolf's Seneschal. Oscar. I would that Wulfstan might have staid behind; He hath the Heretoch's ear, and though he's wise His wisdom is not for the camp; we march As with a drag-chain. Seneschal. Nay, good Oscar, nay; Further we cannot yet; the force in front Hourly increases; our reserves are late; And nothing comes from Wessex. Enter Wulfstan the Wise. Worthy Sir, Your daughter, as I hear, is married. Well, It is a blessing if her choice be yours, And if it be not, still the father's heart Will give the child God-speed. Wulfstan. Assuredly. I did but bid her be less mutable, Telling her that the past, or worse or better, If driven in her and experienced home, Might be as piles whereon to build the future, Else insecure. I bade her be resolved, Her choice now planted, forth of it to bring The fruits of constancy; for constancy On all things works for good; the barren breeds, The fluent stops, the fugitive is fixed By constancy. I told you, did I not, The story of the wind, how he himself, The desultory wind, was wrought upon? Oscar. Yes, Sir; you told it twice. [Exit Seneschal. Wulfstan. The tale was this: The wind when first he rose and went abroad Through the waste region, felt himself at fault, Wanting a voice; and suddenly to earth Descended with a wafture and a swoop, Where wandering volatile from kind to kind He wooed the several trees to give him one. First he besought the ash; the voice she lent Fitfully with a free and lashing change Flung here and there its sad uncertainties: The aspen next; a fluttered frivolous twitter Was her sole tribute: from the willow came, So long as dainty summer dressed her out, A whispering sweetness, but her winter note Was hissing, dry, and reedy: lastly the pine Did he solicit, and from her he drew A voice so constant, soft, and lowly deep, That there he rested, welcoming in her A mild memorial of the ocean-cave Where he was born. Enter Leolf, with Emma, Ernway, and Grimbald. Leolf. Unhappy news! last night— Sorely I grieve—ay, bitterly repent— Had I been in my place—oh, weak recoil— But it avails not.—Yesterday, my friends, Was fruitful in events; the King was crowned, Was married, was o'ermastered by the monks; The Queen the while to Chester carried captive, Earl Athulf to the Tower. Oscar. In one short day All this befell? Wulfstan. Oh, woe-bewildered day! Grimbald. A shout—a hubbub in the camp—our ears Are but fool's ears, and yet they hear a shout. Leolf. A welcome to some friend; as each arrives They hail him thus, and as the force he brings Is more or less, so measure they the cry. This is the loudest I have heard. Look out. Ernway. I see no force, my Lord; and but one man, Who hurries hitherward, and as he comes They crowd him, and with clapping of their hands And shouting bring him on. See! Athulf enters hastily. Athulf. Oh, my friend . . . Leolf . . . Alas! . . . What, Grimbald with you! . . . Nay, You know it then already. Think no worse Of us or of our fortunes than they are. This half-faced treason will not touch the life. Ill-starred ambition! Oh, my luckless sister! But think her not endangered. Leolf. And yourself? How came you hither? Were you not in ward? Athulf. The Princess with a signet of the King's, Gold of her own, and promises and tears, Wrought on my guards. They follow me. Oh, Leolf! You are avenged. My sister, oh, my sister! She is not and she could not be forgiven! God's justice . . . Leolf. Athulf, say no more but this; She stands within the keeping of God's love. For earthly aid, 'twill reach her with such speed As earthly love can minister. The light troops Shall march with me to Cheshire, leaving you With the main body of my force and those That soon will join you, to relieve the King. So shall I check the rising in the West, Which we must look for else, and so provide Against extremities and accidents That else might hurt the Queen. They muster now And wait me on the ramparts. Athulf. I am with you. [Exeunt Leolf and Athulf. Oscar. These are sad tidings. Emma. With a frightful force They tear Earl Athulf, for his hopes were high And he was crowding canvas. To his friend, Whom in a foggy grief they found becalmed, They come but as a vivifying gust To quicken what was dead: from this time forth A cry is in his heart, a trumpet-call That sounds a summons to the rescue: see If he obey it not. Oscar. A settled gloom Was in his face before. Emma. A seated pain Preyed on him inwards. Wulfstan. Ah! that inward pain! A lobster, should his limb . . . Grimbald. Ho! Holla! Ho! The camp is all in motion. Look! Behold! The banners fly i' the wind. Emma. A token this That we are soon to march. Get we afoot. [Exeunt Emma, Oscar, and Grimbald. Wulfstan. A lobster, should his limb have eating sores, Or his articulate coat of mail be pierced, Snaps the offending member at the joint And casts it off—such surgery is his; And as by instinct he, so we by art Of amputation, easily discard The outward seats of pain— Emma (from behind the scene). Come, father, come. Wulfstan. The outward seats of pain—I will, my child. Scene II. —A Chamber in the Tower of London. Dunstan (alone). Kings shall bow down before thee, said my soul, And it is even so. Hail, ancient hold! Thy chambers are most cheerful, though the light Enter not freely; for the eye of God Smiles in upon them. Cherished by His smile My heart is glad within me, and to Him Shall testify in works a strenuous joy. —Methinks that I could be myself that rock Whereon the Church is founded,—wind and flood Raging and rushing, boisterous in vain. I thank you, Gracious Powers! Supernal Host! I thank you that on me, though young in years Ye put the glorious charge to try with fire, To winnow and to purge. I hear you call! A radiance and a resonance from heaven Surrounds me, and my soul is breaking forth In strength, as did the new-created sun When earth beheld it first on the fourth day. God spake not then more plainly to that orb Than to my spirit now. I hear the call. My answer, God, and Earth, and Hell shall hear. But I could reason with thee, Gracious Power, For that thou giv'st me to perform thy work Such sorry instruments. The Primate shakes, Gunnilda totters.—Gurmo!—And of those That stand for me more absolutely, most Are slaves through fear, not saints by faith. But no, I would not they were worthier; for thus The work shall be the more mine own. Enter Gurmo. What now? Gurmo. You called. Dunstan. I think I did. Send me those Bishops. [Exit Gurmo. —More eminently mine own. The Church is great, Is holy, is ineffably divine! Spiritually seen and with the eye of faith The body of the Church, lit from within, Seems but the luminous phantom of a body; The incorporeal spirit is all in all. Eternity â parte post et ante So drinks the refuse, thins the material fibre, That lost in ultimate tenuity The actual and the mortal lineaments, The Church in time, the meagre, definite, bare Ecclesiastical anatomy, The body of this death, translates itself, And glory upon glory swallowing all Makes earth a scarce distinguishable speck In universal heaven. Such is the Church As seen by faith; but otherwise beheld, The body of the Church is searched in vain To find the sojourn of the soul; 'tis nowhere. Here are two Bishops, but 'tis not in them. Enter Oswald, Bishop of Worcester, and Ethelwald, Bishop of Winchester. Save you, my Lords! Are there no seats? A stool— Fetch me a stool. [A stool is brought, on which Dunstan seats himself. The Bishops continue standing. What business brings you here? Oswald. Lord Abbot, we have served thee faithfully, And still obeyed thy voice through many a change. We would that others, who have done no less In outward show, were inwardly as true. Dunstan. Who fails? Ethelwald. We do not say distinctly who, Nor positively point by point wherein; But this we say, that we whose hearts are known From yours inseparable, are no longer prized By some amongst our brethren as we were. We hear that Bishops meet by tens and twelves Unknown to us; we think unknown to you. We therefore deemed it parcel of our duty To give you warning. Dunstan. Is there more? Oswald. To-day There spreads a rumour that Prince Edgar's force Met on the Avon by the Heretoch Was beaten back and scattered. Joining this To what is surer, that Earl Athulf's power Creeps close upon us, sundry citizens That are of credit with the baser sort About the suburbs, stir them up to riot. Dunstan. Doth nothing happen to such men? 'Tis strange; Good men for whom the Church puts up her prayers Are daily taken off. Ethelwald. 'Tis said moreover The Synod when it meets will not be pure Nor of one mind. Dunstan. 'Tis ignorantly said: I am the Synod's mind. Sirs, you did well To bring me what had reached you. Leave me now. Come back at night. The interval use well; And what you gather give me then to know. [Exeunt Bishops. This faction runs ahead. What mean they then? Why, verily to abuse and by their wiles Betray the Synod. Nothing less. But God, Who to the Devil incarnate in the snake Gave subtlety, denies not to His saints (So they shall use it to His glory and gain) The weapon He permitted to the fiend. Erratic Spirit, here thou art, wild worm Piercing the earth with subterraneous toil, And there with wings scouring the darkened sky! Still do I meet thee; still, wherever met, I foil thee; sometimes as with Michael's sword, Sometimes as with thine own. To arms! false Fiend; We meet to-morrow in the assembled Church. Scene III. —Palace of the Archbishop in London. Odo, with Leofwyn, Bishop of Lincoln, and Fridstan Bishop of Lichfield. Odo. It stands not with our honour either way To be so overridden. Fridstan. One sole man, Though he were Saint uprisen, no charter hath To lead by the nose the fathers of the Church, The Archbishop and the Bishops. Zeal is good; But zeal is one thing when it fasts and prays, And when it ramps and rages 'tis another. Leofwyn. When he refused the bishopric from Edred My mind misgave me. Oh, I said, this man Is humble upside-down. He that rejects With publication and profession loud Of lowliness, an orderly advancement, Looks, be assured, what's orderly to pass, And leave degrees behind. Fridstan. Yea, brother, yea; He that denies himself to be a Bishop Looks further than is fitting; he means not well; He thinks to say to us, Go here, go there; Me, Dunstan, standing sole, the gaping world Shall gaze at, bidding Bishops stand aside. This is not right. Leofwyn. No, nor canonical. Odo. Brethren, when I unfolded all the doubts That compassed round the cause, the enemy's strength, The fears, the double faces, the false hearts That walk amongst us,—reasons all that plead For caution and some temperate composition,— He checked and chid me like a troublesome child That prates at random; bade me know that God Revealed it otherwise, and he must needs Believe in God; then calling for a scourge Said 'twas a time for exercise devout, And he entreated my good company For mutual castigation. Enter Sigeric. Sigeric. Honoured Lords, The wench which had an audience some days since, Has now returned; an aged man is with her. Odo. Admit them both. [Exit Sigeric. Now we shall find how far Earl Athulf will be compromised. Come in. Re-enter Sigeric, followed by Emma and Wulfstan the Wise. Good wench, we have expected thee, and thou Art welcome—but who's this? Emma. A man, my Lords, Known to you all by fame though not by favour; Wulfstan the Wise. Odo. Sir, you are welcome too; Earl Athulf peradventure deems the knot Of these affairs worthy your skill and care, Wherein by message he hath dealt till now Conveyed us through this envoy, weak by sex, But verily quick-witted. Sir, we know Your great renown for wisdom and we hail Your advent hither; for we deem the Earl, In calling age and wisdom to his aid, Is wise though young; and if he be, the terms We offer are what wisdom will commend And modesty embrace. Wulfstan. My good Lords, far Beyond my merits doth my fame extend; But moderation alway have I praised And peace ensued, and therefore have been held To mediate not unfit, when Mars attired In triple steel on this side shakes his spear, Bellona upon that side mounts her car By Flight and Terror drawn. Odo. You doubtless know The tenor of our terms,—all regulars Since Edred's death supplanted to return Save those who did themselves in Edred's reign Supplant in benefices duly holden The secular incumbents—the new Queen To be acknowledged so soon as the Pope Shall grant his dispensation. Even you, Though secular yourselves, must see in this The scales of justice balanced. To these terms What saith the brave Earl Athulf? Emma. Me, my Lords, Earl Athulf charged with what from him proceeds; What from my father (for he is my father) You hear, be pleased to value at its worth As his, but not the Earl's. Leofwyn. The Earl is wise; The starling shall be true to what she's taught, Whilst birds of divination—well—the matter— How is the Earl inclined to us? Emma. My Lords, The Earl inclines; but ere he shall impledge Or the Lord Heretoch or himself, he looks To be assured the Synod late convened For other ends, will wisdom learn from you, And set its seal to this. Odo. The Earl demands No more than what is just and right. To-morrow The Synod meets, and if our voice prevail Will ratify the terms. But Dunstan still His purpose holds, and it is rumoured now Hath secret intercourse with Rome, for ends Unknown to us. Leofwyn. Earl Athulf doubtless knows The motion may not from ourselves proceed, But let it be propounded on his part, Or by the seculars before the Synod, And we shall so foreshape the minds of men That by the acclaim of most, if not of all, It shall be hailed acceptable. Emma. My Lords, The Earl forgot not this, and therefore sends With me my father, that persuasively He may, according to his gifts, impart The proffered compact, with the instances That recommend it to the assembled Church; Trusting to you to second and support What he delivers. Odo. Sir, be not afraid, But speak it roundly. Emma. Oh, my Lords, for that, The spirit within him, when it works to speech, Fears neither Saint nor Devil. Leofwyn. That is well. Yet touch not Dunstan with too rough a hand, But rather against us be seen to bear. Wulfstan. My Lord Archbishop and Lords Suffragans, I have considered of my speech, and first The order of the topics have set down With notes and comments, if it please you, thus: Exordium, with a forecast of the close: A forecast of the close; for mark, my Lords, An argument or abstract setting forth In the beginning of my discourse the end, With index to the bearings and the joints, Shall quicken you to apprehend my drift, And by a foreknown relevancy clench The links and consequents, that so my speech May, like the serpent with his tail in his mouth, Rejoin itself, whilst in its perfect round Its lithe articulation stands approved. Leofwyn. We doubt not of your skill, but what in chief Concerns us, is the matter and the drift. Wulfstan. The dangers of division to the realm I feelingly expose: next I commend The golden mean,—that wisdom's triumph true Which seeks no conquest save by wisdom's ways And scorns to trust to fortune or to force: Earl Athulf's dispositions shall I then Duly develop; him shall I disclose As one whose courage high and humour gay Cover a vein of caution, his true heart, Brave though it be, not blind to danger, no, But through imagination's optic glass Discerning, yea and magnifying it may be, What still he dares: him in these colours dressed I shall set forth as prompt for enterprise By reason of his boldness, and yet apt For composition, owing to that vein Of fancy which enhances, prudence which wards Contingencies of peril: then from a scroll Subscribed by him I read the proffered terms, And in my oratorical conclusion Draw my speech round to dangers of the realm Seen in divisions, and the joys of peace. Odo. 'Tis dexterously devised, and with our aid Shall win the general suffrage of the Synod; For certain of your friends the seculars, By secret incitation heartened up, Will give their voices. Till the Synod meets, Beseech you be not seen abroad. Farewell! Scene IV. —A fortified causeway leading to a chapel near the Tower of London.—Thorbiorga is discovered leaning with her harp against a parapet in the background. The bell for vespers is ringing, and parties pass towards the chapel. Enter in front a patrol of two Soldiers. 1st Soldier. A minstrel, is she? 2nd Soldier. By her garb, I think, A fortune-teller. 1st Soldier. I have seen the day When such would travel with a princely train, Welcome to clerk and layman, thane and churl; But they may trudge afoot and lack a meal Now that the monks are uppermost, God wot! 2nd Soldier. Filth of the wicked! dotage of the Gentiles! Is all they get from them. But Heida still And Thorbiorga, though their state is fallen, Hold up their heads. I know not but that yon Is Thorbiorga's self. Pass on this side. [Exeunt. Enter Ethilda with Attendants, who pass on. Ethilda. Forward, my maidens; I will follow soon. The sunset with a warm and ruddy light Colours the coldness of these gloomy walls And glances in the casements; for the day Makes a good end. Earl Athulf's emissary By this time should be here. I think she comes. Enter Emma. Maiden, I thank you for your diligence. Have you the gold? How light a foot is yours! But is it the Earl's custom to be served By women in such things? Emma. Madam, of me He had assurance from the Heretoch, Who knows me from my cradle, and avouched That I was gifted with a woman's wit And ready with my tongue; and for my heart, It had its own fidelity, he said, And true to him would be if not to truth. Ethilda. Yes, so you serve the Heretoch, not Athulf. Emma. Earl Athulf at the Heretoch's behest; And they are so entwined that serving one Is serving both. Ethilda. No, no, you serve not both; You serve Earl Leolf only. Emma. If it please you. Here is the gold; with this, he said, your way Would soon be opened to the King, whose heart Should then be comforted and fortified, And through his prison doors should see the light, Expecting his deliverance. Ethilda. His heart Is carefuller for the Queen's than for his own: Is nothing known of her? Emma. Nor yet of her, Nor of the Heretoch, had tiding reached Earl Athulf's camp: but I had hope to meet The sorceress Thorbiorga; by her art, Or by forerunning of intelligence, What happens to the Heretoch is hers So soon as it befalls if not before. But I have sought her fruitlessly. What's here? I think I see her now. Ethilda. If this be she, Her errand is to us. Emma. Regard her not, For she is freest of her utterance When least observed or importuned. Talk on. Ethilda. I think I asked you—yes—how looked the Earl When last you saw him? Emma. Wasted much. His hair, Which was not till this year so much as grizzled, Is almost grey. Ethilda. Earl Athulf grey? Emma. No, no, Earl Leolf, Madam. Ethilda. Oh! your pardon. Well, How looked Earl Athulf? [Thorbiorga, who has been advancing and touching her harp fitfully, now plays a low prelude. Emma. Madam, I may say Like yonder archway, one half in the shade, The other in the sun; for hope shines through him. Thorbiorga (sings). By sun and moon, By fire and flood, By well and stone, And ashen wood, By lot and torch, By dreams and thunder, Comes that above That would be under. Emma. She will draw nearer, if you mark her not; She's cunning and holds off from questioning, But she will drop you what she has to tell. Thorbiorga (sings again). By Wellesbourne and Charlcote ford, At break of day, I saw a sword. Wessex warriors, rank by rank, Rose on Avon's hither bank; Mercia's men in fair array Looked at them from Marraway; Close and closer ranged they soon, And the battle joined at noon. By Wellesbourne and Charlcote Lea I heard a sound as of the sea: Thirty thousand rushing men, Twenty thousand met by ten; Rang the shield and brake the shaft, Tosty yelled, Harcather laughed; Thorough Avon's waters red Chased by ten the twenty fled. By Charlcote ford and Wellesbourne I saw the moon's pale face forlorn. River flowed and rushes sighed, Wounded warriors groaned and died; Ella took his early rest, The raven stood on his white breast; Hoarsely in the dead man's ear Raven whispered “Friend, good cheer! Ere the winter pinch the crow He that slew thee shall lie low.” Ethilda. She cannot tell us of a victory past But she must dash the triumph of our joy With bodings of the future. Be it so; 'Twixt telling and foretelling, one is sure, The other not. Emma. Hush! Madam; she can hear. Ethilda. Well, Thorbiorga, hast thou aught to say? Thorbiorga. Princess, I may not tarry. To the King Earl Leolf sends his duty, and therewith This writing. Fare you well. [Exit. Ethilda. Stay, Thorbiorga. She's gone; but this shall tell us. Can you read? Emma (reads). “Your Highness shall know that a battle hath been fought and won. Ella the younger led Prince Edgar's power, which ran and left him on the field. I have entered into Staffordshire. Further forward I cannot, and back I will not. The Queen (whom God preserve!) is in life, but in durance: wherein she will remain till your Highness or Earl Athulf can help me. For her safety, I am assured thereof at present, holding in pawn the lives of three revolted Earls, which have fallen into my hands. For her deliverance, should I attempt it of myself, I should but put her to more hazard. Meantime fear not that aught can approach you from the West. “Yours in all duty and fealty, “The Earl Leolf.” Ethilda. This, if I could but to the King convey it, Would much sustain his spirit. Emma. Please you, Madam, To use the gold I brought you—it is done. [Trumpets sound at a distance. Ethilda. Hark! the patrol comes round; pass to the chapel. Scene V. —A Chamber in the Archbishop's Palace. Wulfstan the Wise and Sigeric, the Archbishop's Secretary. Sigeric. With both these puissant Earls, as I hear say, You have been inward. Wulfstan. Yea, Sir, in my time; With Athulf formerly, with Leolf always. Sigeric. Earl Athulf is a merry man accounted. Wulfstan. Much mirth he hath, and yet less mirth than fancy; His is that nature of humanity Which both ways doth redound, rejoicing now With soarings of the soul, anon brought low: For such the law that rules the larger spirits. This soul of man, this elemental crasis, Completed, should present the universe Abounding in all kinds; and unto all One law is common,—that their act and reach Stretched to the farthest is resilient ever And in resilience hath its plenary force. Against the gust remitting fiercelier burns The fire, than with the gust it burnt before. The richest mirth, the richest sadness too, Stands from a groundwork of its opposite; For these extremes upon the way to meet Take a wide sweep of nature, gathering in Harvests of sundry seasons. Sigeric. These two Earls Are, certes, the prime spirits of the age. Yet hardly may we either Earl esteem A match for Dunstan. From his youth devote To books, with chemic and mechanic art Searching the core of things; and then caught up To Edred's court and favour, studying there The ways of men and policies of States, No marvel from such training that he took An applicable mind; and were he not Pushed sometimes past the confine of his reason He would o'ertop the world. Wulfstan. Sir, could he sway His proper passions, he were lord of all. But he is more their captive than the King, Poor innocent! is his. Sigeric. When others storm Then only is he calm. 'Twas thought at first That when the King stood out against the terms And would not sign, his life would pay the price. But Dunstan went more craftily to work; A wasting diet, with perpetual fear And solitude, he made his ministers, Himself desisting. Wulfstan. His, Sir, you shall find A spirit subdolous, though full of fire. A spider may he best be likened to, Which creature is an adept not alone In workmanship of nice geometry, But is besides a wary politician: He, when his prey is taken in the toils, Withholds himself until its strength be spent With struggles, and its spirit with despair; Then with a patient and profound delight Forth from his ambush stalks. Sigeric. But Dunstan's web Is woven with a difference. He shrinks, 'Tis said, from taking life, unless inflamed By anger, or by exigency pressed; This softness hath he still. Enter Emma. Emma. Why halt you here? The doors are opened to the ante-room, It will be crowded soon; I pray you, come. Earl Sidroc, in a Notary's apparel, Will follow you, and waits you here without. Sigeric. You have the Archbishop's pass? Wulfstan. Yes, here it is. Emma. I can pass too; I have cajoled with smiles The High Gerefa's man that keeps the door. How tardy old friends are; how prompt are new! Taken in the flower and freshness of good-will My friend of yesterday will run his ears Into some risk to please me. On my back He'll put a surplice, and amongst the choir I sing the psalm. But linger not, I pray. Sigeric. The passage to the left—I think you know it. Come, I will show you. Emma. I beseech you, Sir, When you address the Synod, wander not; Be mindful of the purpose. Wulfstan. Yes, my child; I'll sit the purpose close. Truly a light That shines not in its place is worse than none; And when the thought is prized above the purpose, 'Tis Jack o' the Lanthorn speaks. Oh, Sir, your pardon! Scene VI. —A Chamber in the Tower. Dunstan (alone). If miracles were wrought in the olden time More needful are they now. 'Tis He! 'tis He! 'Tis God that speaks; His will, His word, His voice. But erring men, because their eyes behold The channel, undiscerning of the source, Misdeem His voice for mine. Through sight they err; Through seeing what is fleshly they are deaf In spirit, nor can know the voice of God. Oh, that the grace were given me to tear off These mummeries and maskings of the flesh, That so their souls, delivered and discharged From vain bewilderments of sense, redeemed From human 'scapes and diabolic wiles, Should know 'tis verily God's voice they hear! Then what if in the Synod . . . what if there . . . Enter Oswald, Bishop of Worcester, and Ethelwald, Bishop of Winchester. Whom have we now? So, so! what cheer, my Lords? Or, let me say, what tiding? For our cheer, If God be gracious to us, flies not round With every gust. Oswald. The Synod is assembling With seculars commixed. We hear that still Earl Athulf hangs at Tonbridge; but his force Daily increaseth. It is good we go. This hour we meet the Synod in good heart, What cometh with the next we know not. Dunstan. Nay, Who trusteth knoweth. To the Synod then; But let us be expected for a season Before we show ourselves. Scene VII. —An Entrance Hall opening into a Gallery which leads to the Synodal Chamber.—It is filled with Monks, Guards, and Attendants. Two of the Gerefa's or High Sheriff's Deputies are in front. Ecclesiastics of rank, including two or three Abbesses, pass through more and more frequently as the scene proceeds, not unmixed with Civil and Military Functionaries. Each Ecclesiastic is attended by an Acolyte as a train-bearer. 1st Deputy. Here they come. What! a secular! Well, he must pass, though he shall not be welcome. 2nd Deputy. There are more than he. 1st Deputy. They are stricken deer; I would not come amongst the herd if I were they. 2nd Deputy. I never saw Dunstan's chair before. 'Tis a choice piece of workmanship. 1st Deputy. He made it himself, and they say if another were to sit in it, it would toss him in the air. He can make anything, and make it do his bidding. 2nd Deputy. But should his chair be set above the Archbishop's? 1st Deputy. It was so ordered, and indeed he that is above the King is more than one step above the Archbishop. King, said I! Who knows whether there be a King, or in which brother's reign we that are living live? 2nd Deputy. Hush! Speak not so. 1st Deputy. Nay, 'tis the way of the beehive, and courts are no better. Make way, Sirs, if it please you. No offence. Sirs, 'tis my office. Farther back, I pray. 2nd Deputy. Here's Godredud. 1st Deputy. I say ye shall make room; What though he be a secular? he's noble And of a generous life. A Monk. Six meals a day, With morat and spiced ale, is generous living. Also the gout he hath is generous. Another Monk. Bed, board, nor bath, he never yet forewent The joys of for a day. Look at his tonsure; A well-grown acorn's cup would cover it. Enter amongst others, Wulfstan the Wise, habited as an Ecclesiastic, and Sidroc in the dress of a Notary. Sidroc (aside to Wulfstan). Let us stand here, and reckon as they pass The numbers on each side. Enter Emma in a surplice, with a band of Choristers. Emma (aside to the 1st Deputy). Aha! my friend, Know'st thou the merry wench? 1st Deputy. Nay, softly; hush! But pass no further yet; here you shall stand, And I will tell you, as they come, who's who. The first of men! the Angels of the Church! I know them all, and most of them . . . Room, ho! The Abbot of St. Winifred's—Room, room! And most of them I call my friends. Sidroc (aside to Wulfstan). The newt Lived much amongst the tadpoles, and averred He was acquainted with all kinds of fish. 1st Deputy. Here is the Abbot Morcar with one hand. A woman kissed the other, for which cause He chopped it off. He emulates St. Arnulph, And wears a shirt of hedgehog skins. No need To clear the way for him. Emma. Sirs, push me not. No, they fall back unbidden. 1st Deputy. And here is Monn, The Abbot of St. Clive's, that heals the sick And makes the dumb to speak. From far and near Thousands and thousands make resort to him, And them that may not for infirmity He goes to; or if so be he cannot go, He sends his walking-stick, which does as well. Emma. See how they press around him. 1st Deputy. Room, I say, Place for the Abbot of St. Clive's!—Lo, there Cumba, the Priest of Sherborne; more than twice Has he changed sides; but he's so mild and sweet That there are ever some to hold him up. Betwixt the monks and secular Church half-way Stands Cumba, smiling upon both. Sidroc (aside). A chicken Is good for breakfast, and an egg is good; But something half-way 'twixt an egg and chicken Is very vilely bad. 1st Deputy. And truth to say, His faith is mounted on his charity And sits it easy. Sidroc (aside). Cumba is my gauge, And by the crown of his head I know the times. Grow they ascetic, then his tonsure widens; Or free, it narrows in. Emma. What man is this, [Pointing to Wulfstan. With large round silvery head and fair round face And those lost eyes so lustrous that see nothing? Tell me what man is he. 1st Deputy. Some country priest; A man one sees and makes no mention of; He had his pass or I had questioned him, For with my will a priest so meanly clad And slovenly, should take his rags elsewhere. Sidroc (aside). Dogs take distinctions, learning from mankind A worldly lesson, and the beggar's stayed When lace and gawds go free.—What say you, Sir? 1st Deputy. To you, Sir? nothing. [A cry without of “Place for the Archbishop.” A flourish of trumpets, and enter divers Officers of the Archbishop's household in procession. Then the Archbishop, attired in splendid vestments and preceded by Sigeric and Bridferth bearing his mass-book and crucifix. He is supported on the right by the Bishop of Lincoln, on the left by the Bishop of Lichfield, and followed by a long train of Officers and Attendants. Odo (returning the obeisances with which he is received as he passes through). The blessing of God's peace, my sons, be on you; And I beseech you, pray that by God's grace Our counsels may be prospered to His glory. [Passes with his train into the Gallery. 1st Monk. The Primate is too ancient for the times; He is too sudden when he's choleric, Too slow when he's at ease. 2nd Monk. He's shaken both ways. A Thane. The Primate looks an inch or two less tall Than he was wont, methinks; nor is his step So firm as once it was. An Acolyte. Time, Sir, and care. Sidroc (aside). Or peradventure sin and fear.—Good father, Saw you my Lord the Archbishop pass? Wulfstan. My son? Sidroc. Saw you my Lord the Primate? Wulfstan. Yes, my son. Was it not he that passed in gold and purple? Sidroc. The same. We wait but for the Abbot now. Wulfstan. The Abbot? Sidroc. Dunstan. He is first and last. Methinks the muster of the seculars Is stronger than was looked for. What is this? Hark! Hist! A hum as of a multitude Without the gates. Permit me, Sirs. He comes. Enter Dunstan solus, clad in sackcloth, with ashes on his head and a missal in his hand. The foremost of the crowd fall upon their knees and bow their heads as he approaches. Dunstan. Fear ye and tremble, ye that love the Church, For wolves are round about her. Watch and pray. [Passes into the Gallery. Sidroc. Pass on, pass on; the benches will be thronged. Stick close to me, good father. God ha' mercy! Sir, I beseech you to remit your elbow. 1st Deputy. Keep order, constables! what a fray is here! Sidroc. Could we but pass this friar, all were won. St. Hilda! what a mountain of a friar! Sir, pray you die and do the Church some service; You'd choke the way to Hell.—Now is the time; Come, father, come; stick close to me; here, here. Knock down that chorister. I thank you, Sir. Scene VIII —The Synodal Chamber. —The first only of those who passed from the Hall into the Gallery in the preceding scene are present at the opening of this. At the further end, within a silver rail, is the Shrine of St. Austin, with its cross. At the hither end, near the door, are the High Gerefa and the Doorkeeper. Gerefa. So—bar the door; all those we want we have, And more. Doorkeeper. The gallery without is full, And none are there but have the Archbishop's pass. Gerefa. Too many have it. Bar the doors. What's this? The precinct of St. Austin's Shrine is dark. It should be lighted. Doorkeeper. Yea, Sir, and it was. Gerefa. And who put out the lights? Doorkeeper. I know not that. Gerefa. Well; bar the doors. Doorkeeper. I cannot for this friar. Gerefa. Then let him pass. Doorkeeper. 'Twill scarce be he alone. [The Friar enters, and is followed by Sidroc, Wulfstan,and others. Gerefa. What, more and more! I tell thee, shut them out. [The doors are closed. Now, let us all with all our best of breath Shout, “Silence!” [Shouts of “Silence!” In the name and by the power Of holiest Mother Church, I here declare This Synod opened. The Archbishop speaks. Odo. Friends, brethren, helpmates, councillors in Christ! The dangers and divisions of the Church Have called you hither. Be ye all as one. For though the letter of citation saith “Semotis Laicis,” yet to one end Are we assembled all,—concord and peace, And whosoever hath God's peace at heart, Him we rejoice to meet. Since last I saw you here, that virtuous King, The godly Edred, hath been hence translated, And Edwin hath succeeded, who is young. King Edwin, Sirs, descended of a house Illustrious no less for piety Than earthly honours, could not but abound, At first and by the fashioning of nature, In Christian graces: but, Sirs, being young, He, through the easiness of youth betrayed To bad advice and making haste to err, Did what was not convenient in a King. For first from many a monastery, sown Throughout the land in Edred's bounteous reign, With violence and with force of arms he drave Our Benedictine brethren—not alone Them that were placed by Edred in the shoes Of seculars that by Edred were expulsed, But ancient men that had been there aforetime. And next, Sirs, which is chiefly what concerns Our present meeting,—next, Sirs, did he marry; And whom, Sirs, did he marry? One like himself, Though doubtless graced with many virtues, young And erring, and in nothing more astray Than in this marriage; being, as they are, Cousins in the second degree and undispensed. This marriage, Sirs, contracted by surprise, Was scandalous, as ye know, to all good men And grievous to the Church; and weighing well What evil fruit to these and after times Might of its hasty consummation grow, We deem'd it best that this unbedded bride Should visit Chester, there to live recluse Until the assembled Church of what had chanced Were advertised. 'Tis therefore ye are here. Councillors in Christ, the cause ye meet to judge Is, briefly, shall this marriage stand or no? Sidroc (aside to Wulfstan). Stop; Cumba fumbles with the folds of his alb; I think he'll speak; withhold yourself awhile. Odo. Sirs, I await your censures. For myself I humbly seek instruction, which till I glean From worthier men, my judgment shall be dumb. Cumba. Most holy fathers and my brethren all! To most of you 'tis known that from my youth I have revered the regulars; excellent men, Whom though to imitate had been in me Alas! a vain endeavour, yet to praise Has been my constant care. Sirs, of this praise And of this reverence and constant care I will not bate a jot; for what I was At first, I am, and will be evermore. But to the end unchangeable, the ways Are various as the paths upon the sea; And though 'tis by the stars the vessel steers, Yet lies she with the wind. The choice of ways That opens to you now, doth split itself Into two opposites—the ways of war, The ways of peace; and who betwixt the twain Shall stand with dubious or divided heart? When has the Church been prosperous but in peace? What multiplies the monasteries? Peace. What breeds endowments, treasures, and demesnes? Why, peace. Then shall we not consult for peace? But if we void this marriage, peace is flown; War that ev'n now stands knocking at the gate Must then be bid come in; nor present blows Shall arbitrate an end, but years unborn May in the issue of this marriage see A hand, a sword, a claimant of the crown, A cause of strife. I grant the marriage rash; But out of common life this lesson cull: A marriage unadvisedly contracted By a hot stripling, in the parent's heart Kindles a flame at first; but useless ire Is transient with the wise; for were it not, Age should in anger more exorbitate Than youth in love. The parent pacified Binds by a frank forgiveness to himself In bonds of gratitude his erring son: And even as he his son, I deem the Church With reconciling and reclaiming love Shall conquer back the King. My humble voice, Bending to better judgments, thus concludes. Morcar. O thou dead fly that spoilest the pot! O grub! O maggot gendered in a serpent's slime! God spat thee out for being neither hot nor cold, Thou Mammon's friend, and Lucifer licked thee up. Woe to thee, Judas! Art thou not accursed? Thou dippest with us in the dish, but lo! Thou has betrayed us for a piece of money! O shame! O sin! O havoc to the Church! The Devil shall hang thee up to dry, thou rag! For thou art soaked and saturate with sin. Odo. Forbear him, brother. Morcar. O thou filthy rag! Odo. I say, forbear him. Godredud. Brother, art thou mad? He is no traitor, but a faithful priest. Why dost thou rail upon him thus! Odo. Forbear! Morcar. Cry out and cease not! saith the voice I hear— Search out the sleights of Bel and slay the Dragon; And who saith, Cease, be dumb! Odo. I say it, brother; Yea, I command thee, cease. Our brother Monn Is wishful to be heard; speak, brother Monn. Monn. My loving friends and brethren, we are met Upon this marriage, not to speak our own But to declare God's judgments, never yet Made manifest by such apparent signs, Such prodigies and portents. Think, oh, think Upon the darkness of that marriage day! Throughout the land a dismal horror spread; In Essex it rained blood; at Evesham An image of the Virgin, as ye know, Was seen to weep and sweat and lift its hands And roll its eyes; at Selsey and at Wells The vault of heaven was fill'd with falling stars, And fiery serpents weltered in the skies. Have we forgotten that these things befel, Or know we not their import? Then, alas! Are we more careless of the cause of God Than Gallio, more blind than Elymas. But if we bear in mind that such things were, We must not, dare not, judge what God hath judged. Godredud. The worthy Abbot, by my faith, my Lords, Doth excellently well to bid us weigh These miracles and signs. They signified, Doubtless, some untoward events, my Lords; But what those untoward events should be Behoves us not too rashly to deliver; Divisions in the realm, it may be, war, Implacable revenge and hatred dire And wrath which wills not that its wounds be healed. The birthday of a progeny like this Would doubtless teem with warnings, which to blink Or read awry should work us infinite woe. But to those premonitions further signs Constructive and illustrative succeed; And now two armies in the south and west Auspiciously afoot, give countenance To Edwin's cause as favoured from above, And warn us, if fair terms of composition Be offered, not to spurn them. Sidroc. (aside to Wulfstan). Now, now, now; Stand up and speak—produce them. Wulfstan. Here they are, Most noble Godredud; here are the terms: “I, Athulf, Earl, intent on sparing life, But purposing to lodge on Ludgate Hill At latest in three days, to all concerned Send greeting and say thus: All regulars, Since Edred's death supplanted, may return, Save those who did themselves, in Edred's reign, Supplant in benefices duly holden The secular incumbents; the new Queen Shall be received, and so soon as the Pope Shall grant his dispensation, shall be crowned: Which yielded, no man in his life or goods Shall answer for the past.”—My Lords and friends, These are the terms I bring you from Earl Athulf, And I am Wulfstan. [Acclamations from the Secular party, mingled with shouts of rage and execrations from the other. Brethren, hear me speak; Brethren and friends, I fain would speak to you; My friends and brethren, hear me, I beseech you. Odo. My sons, this passion and this noise I hold Unworthy this assembly. Hear him speak, For he was never factious nor inflamed Against us, and 'tis just that he be heard. [Acclamations from the Seculars. Wulfstan. I am not factious, brethren, nor inflamed, For my abode was always, so to say, Oh Mount Olympus— Monn. Fie upon thee, Pagan! Oh, but I know thee and thy place full well. Wulfstan. On Mount Olympus with the Muses nine I ever dwelt . . . Monks. He doth confess it! Lo! He doth confess it! Faggots and a stake! He is a Heathen—shall a Heathen speak? Morcar. I hear a voice that saith, “Make lime of his bones.” Sidroc. Sirs, ye mistake him; he is a pious priest, And what he means to say is merely this: Against your orders and your monasteries He speaks not; but he deems that holiest men, If they would flourish in this warlike world, Must feed within a fence of secular swords; And better were it for you to engulf But half the kingdom's treasure, so begirt, Than to be left defenceless with the whole, And thus be fattened but to feed the Dane. He bids you know that in this land this day He finds more fat than bones, more monks than men: He bids you to the seaboard look, where now A fleet of Northmen, fifty-six tall ships, Hang in St. George's Channel, waiting there Till half the land shall cut each other's throats And leave the other half a spoil to them. Bethink you, then; escape ye hardly may From the two puissant and prudent Earls, Athulf and Leolf; but this granted you, Ye do but fall a weak and present prey To Sweyne and Olaf; wherefore make your choice And thrive in peace or brave a twofold ruin. Priest. Well said! Monk. Who's this? Another. A lambskin man he is; A fellow that puts his legs in lambskin hose. Morcar. The Lord shall smite him with the botch of Egypt. Several Secular priests (joined by some of the Monks, amidst clamour and confusion). We will have peace; we are not men of blood; Are we not Christians all? The Dane—the Dane! Are we not servants of the Prince of Peace? The Northmen are upon us—Olaf and Sweyne! [Dunstan throws himself on his knees and bows his head to the ground. Sidroc. (aside to Wulfstan). He bends before the storm. Wulfstan. Will he not speak? Sidroc. I know not—yes—he is in act to hatch A brood of pestilent words; yea, is he not? He stirs, he moves—few moments are enough. Wulfstan. They say a louse that's but three minutes old May be a grandsire; with no less a speed Do foul thoughts gender. Sidroc. Ha! we'll see anon— Faith of my body! up he goes—sit—sit. Dunstan (rising slowly). I groan in spirit. Brethren, seek not in me Support or counsel. The whole head is sick, The whole heart faint, and trouble and rebuke Come round about me, thrusting at my soul. But, brethren, if long years of penance sore, For your sake suffered, be remembered now, Deem me not utterly of God forsaken, Deem not yourselves forsaken; lift up your hearts; See where ye stand on earth; see how in heaven Ye are regarded. Ye are the sons of God, The order of Melchisedeck, the law, The visible structure of the world of spirit, Which was, and is, and must be; all things else Are casual, and monarchs come and go, And warriors for a season walk the earth, By accident; for these are accidental, But ye eternal; ye are the soul of the world, Ye are the course of nature consecrate, Ye are the Church; one spirit is throughout you, And Christendom is with you in all lands. Who comes against you? 'Scaped from Hell's confine A wandering rebel, fleeting past the sun, Darkens the visage of the spouse of Christ. But 'tis but for a moment; he consumed Shall vanish like a vapour, she divulged Break out in glory that transcends herself. The thrones and principalities of earth, When stood they that they stood not with the aid Of us and them before us? Azarias, Azias, Amaziah, Saul himself, Fell they not headlong when they fell from us? And Oza, he that did but touch the ark? Oh, then, what sin for me, what sin for you, For me victorious in a thousand fights Against this foe, for you as oft redeemed, That now we falter! Do we falter? No! Thou God that art within me when I conquer, I feel Thee fill me now! Angelic host, Seraphs that wave your swords about my head, I thank you for your succours! Who art thou That givest me this gracious admonition? Alas! forgive me that I knew thee not, O, Gabriel! I do as thou command'st; All earthly counsels I renounce, abjure, And utterly abhor. I ask of God, Is it His will that this His chosen Church Shall ratify these nuptials? Hark! oh, hark! Nay, heard ye not a voice? Oh, Earth, be still! Again and louder—Absit hoc ut fiat! A voice from the precinct of St. Austin's Shrine. Absit hoc ut fiat! Dunstan. Wondrous word! Oh, precious guidance! Oh, ineffable grace! That dost from disobedience deliver The hearts of even the faithless! We obey, And these espousals do we now declare Avoided and accursed; the woman espoused, By name Elgiva, from the man called Edwin We separate, and from the Church's pale We cast her forth, and with her we cast forth Those three that have been foremost to uphold her, Earl Athulf and Earl Leolf and Earl Sidroc. Them we proclaim, by sentence of the Pope, From Christian rites and ministries cut off, And from the holy Brotherhood of the Just Sequestered with a curse. Be they accursed! Accursed be they in all time and place, Accursed be they in the camp and mart, Accursed be they in the city and field, Accursed be their flying and abiding, Accursed be their waking and their rest— We curse the hand that feeds them when they hunger, We curse the arm that props them when they faint; Withered and blasted be that hand and arm! We curse the tongue that speaks to them, the ear That hears them, though it be but unawares: Blistered and cankered be that tongue and ear! The earth in which their bodies shall be buried We curse, except it cast their bodies out; We shut the gates of Heaven against their souls, And as this candle that I fling to the ground, So be their light extinguished in the Pit! Morcar and other Monks. Amen! So be it! Be it so! Amen! Sidroc (aside to Wulfstan). The day is lost—away—skip—scud—begone. Sidroc and Wulfstan, with others of the Secular party, retire amidst the shouts and execrations of the Regulars. Dunstan. Publish the miracle without the gates; Declare the sentence of the Pope. Odo. Fly hence, Ye that are Secular! They will rouse the people; There will be violence and blood; fly hence. This council is dismissed. The grace of God Be with you all! This Synod is dissolved. ACT IV. Scene I. —Tonbridge Castle. Athulf and Grimbald. Athulf. There—take my truncheon—thou couldst rule my force With more acceptance in the general mind Than I. By Heaven, I am ashamed to see Such bickerings in a camp! Give me a cowl And let me rule a monastery rather. Grimbald. There—take my cap and bells—I'll rule your force, And wisely too; but when I look for love In change for wisdom from the multitude, Give me again my good old cap and bells. Athulf. Ah, fool, you're right—and that man is not wise That cannot bear to be accounted foolish. I must be patient. Yet it frets my heart, Amongst my many cares, to be reviled By shallow coxcombs whom I daily save, Rescue, redeem, snatch from a rubbishy tomb Amongst the ruins of their wits, pulled down By their own hands upon their heads, God help them! Well, I'll be patient. Fetch me the muster-roll. [Exit Grimbald. 'Tis ill to bear, though. Enter Sidroc and Wulfstan the Wise. Ha! my friends! in this At least has fortune favoured me. I feared The tidings of our misadventurous Synod Augured but ill for both of you. Well met! Bonfires shall blaze for this. What! 'twas your heels, I think, that brought you hither? Sidroc. For myself, When I am frightened I can run with wings, Fast as an ostrich; but preserve me, Heaven! From flying with Philosophy in hand! Athulf. What! was our philosophic friend so slow? Sidroc. When I am flying for my life henceforth Welcome be any ordinary load— Anchises on my back, if so ye will; But spare me, Athulf, if you love your friend, From bringing Wisdom with me. Wulfstan. Well, my Lords, I will not cumber you again. Farewell! I will return— Sidroc. To Mount Olympus? Wulfstan. Yes. To such a sanctuary as that was once. So tranquil were the elements there, 'tis said That letters by the finger of the priest Writ in the ashes of the sacrifice Remained throughout the seasons uneffaced. And Oxford now has academic bowers Sacred to many a Muse, where such as I May write, though in a rough, tempestuous age, What Time shall spare. Thither, my Lords, I'll go, And there I'll chronicle your deeds. Farewell. Athulf. Farewell, good Wulfstan; and I speak the word With reverence and love; for gifts like yours Are all unworthy to be wasted here. But take this with you,—wild and unreclaimed As doubtless must appear to yours my wit, Yet you have scattered in that wilderness Some seeds that will not perish. Fare you well. Wulfstan. My Lord, your kindness which doth cause these drops Will pardon them. Athulf. God keep you in His peace! If good betide us, it will bring you joy; If evil, you are not so chilled by age, But that you'll mourn. Wulfstan. Long, long, my Lord, if long I live to mourn,—which may not be! 'Tis true The sharpness of our pangs is less in age, As sounds are muffled by the falling snow; But true no less, that what age faintly feels It flings not off. I'll pray for your success. [Exit. Athulf. The miracle of the time is that old man And kind as wise—mine own eyes, too, are moist— Yet he'll forget us ere the sun go down. Sidroc. Then I beseech you to forget him now And tell me of your counsels and intents. Athulf. Thus do I stand: My letters from the north Advise me that the Queen's impatient heart Brooks not prolonged captivity, and burns To jeopardize herself, and with herself, Leolf and all his power, in rash attempts At premature escape. Meanwhile the Dane Lurks in the Irish Sea, till civil strife, The needfullest resources draining last, Disarms the seaboard, and as well may hap Disables us within. My army here Frets at the Pope's anathema, and some, Whose ears are open-doored to phantoms, swear When they would sleep o' nights they hear the voice That was, they're pleased to say, ne'er born of man, And scared the Synod. Sidroc. Save me, Heaven, from dupes; Leave me to deal with Devils as I may. My life upon it, 'twas a thing contrived— The voice, I'll warrant, of some deep-mouthed monk That skulked behind the cross. Athulf. This pause, besides, Disheartens them, and lo! a laggard I, That lingers on the road for lack of heart. There is a fortitude in standing still Which leaders know, but they that follow, never. Daily I hear ten thousand tongues cry out “Forward to London,” and I stir not. Still I must not stand upon this strength too long, And truth to say, the levies that come now Are scarcely worth the waiting for. That ban Dispersed them on their way. All which revolved I meditate to make a sudden march, And seize the Tower by night. Sidroc. I am with you there. The more, that we have friends within the walls. That wily wench who carried in your letters Remains behind, and unsuspected still. Athulf. Moreover, she hath with her store of gold; And some there be keep watch and ward whose thirst Gapes wide for golden showers. Sidroc. So frail are they! Now, would you know the thirst that masters me, Bethink you of the dust of sixty miles Swallowed since sunrise with no drop to drink. Athulf. Ah! God forgive me! To the buttery, come. Scene II. —London. An Apartment in the Tower. Dunstan and Gurmo. Dunstan. Whence com'st thou? From the King? Is he awake? Gurmo. He is. Dunstan. How slept he? Soundly through the night? Gurmo. He did. Dunstan. Why how? Did not the dogs then bark? Gurmo. Yes; he slept still. Dunstan. The watches of the night Are changed too seldom. Once an hour henceforth Let them be changed, and ever as they change Let drums and trumpets sound. Gurmo. Her Majesty Has waited long. Likewise the Primate. Dunstan. Whew! I had forgotten them. Conduct them hither. [Exit Gurmo. The fear, but not the fact, of death . . . if this, This only should suffice,—why, then, my soul Should find a free deliverance to the work, And after hold its state more cheerfully. If not, the darkness of the mortal deed Shall yet be kindled by a light divine. Enter the Queen Mother and Odo. Content you, Madam. Let me hear no more. You have another and a better son; Though this should not deserve to reign nor live,— As he is truly dead in his offence Already, yea, and stinketh,—yet should that Applausively succeed. I say no more; But leave to me the working out God's will Touching them both. Queen Mother. My Lord, your very self Was witness of his hardihood and spite, And how most filthily by word of mouth He spat upon me, so to say, and railed Foully with evil speaking from his heart, Renouncing and disowning me for aye, Likewise the ten commandments. Yet, my Lord, He is my son—this womb did bring him forth— You know not what it is to be a mother; I do beseech you, spare him! Dunstan. To what end? For God's behoof, or yours, or his, or whose? Queen Mother. Speak, my Lord Primate; bid him to spare my son. Dunstan. Who biddeth me? Odo. Lord Abbot, by mine office I might be bold to speak by way of bidding; Yet still remembering thine unrivalled merits And services to God, I say but this: The times are evil; accidents may come Yielding occasion of exceeding malice With havoc to the Church and injury And backward sliding, if beyond the range Of Christian prudence, through inordinate zeal, We push our present promise of success. For of one colour though the city be, And neighbouring shires the same, still is the land, Eastward and northward specially, a web Diversely diapered; for here the weft Is spun of light and dipped in dyes of heaven; There, dyed in Styx and spun of Satan's slaver. We may not think that Athulf, who is held To number twenty thousand, will be scared By caps of citizens tossed up i' the air; Nor may we count upon the citizens' caps For courses which may seem to some extreme. Wherefore behoves us so to use success As not to raise against us those, though erring, Whose honest zeal stands stoutly for the crown, Demanding strict succession. Dunstan. Be content. Though neither law nor usage of the realm Did ever yet demand what these demand, Nor ever yet did honesty so err, Still have I pondered all. The godless King Shall abdicate; he shall not be removed. Odo. If reason should so work with him at length That such should be his choice, 'twere excellent. Dunstan. Since he was crowned, experience, by my hand Directed, hath admonished him to deem The state of Kings unenviable. Now He shall be tutored to perceive the joys Of privateness, best fitted for his years. I pray you meddle not. Nor, Madam, you. And when we meet again some three days hence, 'Twill be in Edgar's reign, whom God preserve! Scene III. —A Precinct of the Tower. Ethilda and Emma. Ethilda. They will not; for they say that I am watched, And to find entrance to the King for me Should bring a double danger; but for you They would attempt it. At the hour of none The Abbot will be with him, after which You will have least to fear. Emma. Unless a ghost Stand in the doorway, terror is there none Can turn me backward. Ethilda. Is your father safe? Emma. Fled with Earl Sidroc. We shall meet ere-night. Scene IV. —A Chamber in the Tower. Dunstan and Edwin. Dunstan. How does your Grace? Edwin. What need for you to ask? Let me remind you of an antique verse: What sent the messengers to hell Was asking what they knew full well. You know that I am ill and very weak. Dunstan. You do not answer with a weakened wit. Is there offence in this my visitation? If so, I leave you. Edwin. Yes, there is offence. And yet I would not you should go. Offence Is better than this blank of solitude. I am so weary of no company, That I could almost welcome to these walls The Devil and his Angels. You may stay. Dunstan. What makes you weak? Do you not like your food, Or have you not enough? Edwin. Enough is brought; But he that brings it drops what seems to say That it is mixed with poison—some slow drug; So that I scarce dare eat and hunger always. Dunstan. Your food is poisoned by your own suspicions. 'Tis your own fault. Though Gurmo's zeal is great, It is impossible he should so exceed As to put poison in your food,—I think. But thus it is with Kings; suspicions haunt And dangers press around them all their days; Ambition galls them, luxury corrupts, And wars and treasons are their talk at table. Edwin. This homily you should read to prosperous Kings; It is not needed for a King like me. Dunstan. Who shall read homilies to a prosperous King! 'Twas not long since that thou didst seem to prosper, And then I warned thee; and with what event Thou knowest; for thy heart was high in pride. A hope that, like Salome, danced before thee Did ask my head. But I reproach thee not. Much rather would I, seeing thee abased, Lift up thy mind to wisdom. Edwin. Heretofore It was not in my thoughts to take thy head; But should I reign again . . . Come, then, this wisdom That thou wouldst teach me; harmless as the dove I have been whilom; let me now, though late, Learn from the serpent. Dunstan. To thy credulous ears The world, or what is to a King the world, The triflers of thy Court, have imaged me As cruel and insensible to joy, Austere and ignorant of all delights That arts can minister. Far from the truth They wander who say thus. I but denounce Loves on a throne and pleasures out of place. I am not old; not twenty years have fled Since I was young as thou; and in my youth I was not by those pleasures unapproached Which youth converses with. Edwin. No! wast thou not? How came they in thy sight? Dunstan. When Satan first Attempted me, 'twas in a woman's shape; Such shape as may have erst misled mankind When Greece or Rome upreared with Pagan rites Temples to Venus, pictured there or carved With rounded, polished, and exuberant grace, And mien whose dimpled changefulness betrayed Through jocund hues the seriousness of passion. I was attempted thus, and Satan sang With female pipe and melodies that thrilled The softened soul, of mild voluptuous ease And tender sports that chased the kindling hours In odorous gardens or on terraces To music of the fountains and the birds, Or else in skirting groves by sunshine smitten Or warm winds kissed, whilst we from shine to shade Roved unregarded. Yes, 'twas Satan sang, Because 'twas sung to me, whom God had called To other pastime and severer joys. But were it not for this, God's strict behest Enjoined upon me,—had I not been vowed To holiest service rigorously required, I should have owned it for an Angel's voice, Nor ever could an earthly crown, or toys And childishness of vain ambition, gauds And tinsels of the world, have lured my heart Into the tangle of those mortal cares That gather round a throne. What call is thine From God or man, what voice within bids thee Such pleasures to forego, such cares confront? Edwin. What voice? My kingdom's voice—my people's cry, Whom ye devour—the wail of shepherds true Over their flocks, those godly, kindly priests That love my people and love me withal— Their voice requires me, and the voice of Kings Who died with honour and who live in me, The voice of Egbert, Ethelbert, and Alfred. What wouldst thou more? the voice of Kings unborn To whom my sceptre and my blood descends— A thousand voices call me. Dunstan. Sir, not so; The voicesof this people and those Kings Call on Prince Edgar, not on thee, to reign. There is a voice calls thee, but not to reign, The voice of her thou fain wouldst take to wife; An excommunicated wretch she is Ev'n now, and if thy lust of kingly power Outbid thine other lusts, and starken thee In grasping of that shadow of a sceptre That still is left thee, 'tis a dying voice. For know—unless thou by an instant act Renounce the crown, Elgiva shall not live. The deed is ready, to which thy name affixed Discharges from restraint both her and thee. Say wilt thou sign? Edwin. I will not. Dunstan. Be advised. What hast thou to surrender? I look round; This chamber is thy palace, court, and realm. I do not see the crown. Where is it hidden? Is that thy throne? why, 'tis a base joint-stool; Or this thy sceptre? 'tis an ashen stick Notched with the days of thy captivity. Such royalties to abdicate, methinks, Should hardly hold thee long; nay, I myself, That love not ladies greatly, would give these To ransom whom I loved. Edwin. If all I have Be nothing worth, why ask'st thou me to give it? I trust thee not. I deem myself a King. But let me go at large, and knowing then How stands my realm, what's lost and what remains, I'll answer thee. Dunstan. Now, now, I bid thee answer. Anon I bring the parchment that redeems Another and thyself, from durance both, And one from worse. I bid thee be prepared. [Exit. Edwin. Elgiva! for thy ransom, life were little, A kingdom in itself of no account. But oh! an abject and unkingly act Done by a King, and, as his foes will say, To save himself in his extremity,— This is a purchase thou thyself wilt scorn, Although thyself the rescued. Yet, oh! yet . . . What step is this? Enter Emma. Emma. My Lord, the Abbot comes, And I am here at peril of my life . . . This from Earl Leolf . . . it says the Queen is safe . . . No more or I am lost . . . Earl Athulf . . . nay . . . [Exit. Edwin. Farewell, then, loved Elgiva! I shall die, As now I may, with honour from mankind, And no one in thine ear shall dare to breathe A defamation of my kingly name. They shall not say but that I died a King, And like a King in my regalities. Re-enter Dunstan (holding a scroll). Dunstan. Thy signature to this. Edwin. I will not sign. Dunstan. Thou wilt not! Wilt thou that thy mistress die? Edwin. Insulting Abbot! she is not my mistress; She is my wife, my Queen. Dunstan. Predestinate pair! He knoweth who is the searcher of our hearts That I was ever backward to take life Albeit at His command. Still have I striven To put aside that service, seeking still All ways and shifts that wit of man could scheme To spare the cutting off your wretched souls In unrepented sin. But tendering here Terms of redemption, it is thou, not I, The sentence that deliverest. Edwin. Our lives Are in God's hands. Dunstan. Sot, liar, miscreant, no! God puts them into mine! and may my soul In tortures howl away eternity If ever again it yield to that false fear That turned me from the shedding of thy blood! Thy blood, rash traitor to thy God, thy blood! Thou delicate Agag, I will spill thy blood! Ho, Gurmo! . . . I have sinned like Saul . . . What, ho! Gurmo, I say . . . The sword of Samuel . . . ho! Enter Gurmo. Thou knowest thine office. Let me see thee soon. [Exit. Gurmo (falling on his knees). Mercy, my Lord! Oh, say you grant me life. Edwin. Mercy for thee; what mercy canst thou show? Yet thou art but another's senseless weapon, And if thou needs must do thy bloody work, Strike; I forgive thee. Gurmo. Gracious Lord, not I. Edwin. Then I may have some minutes more to live; But if thou falter, soon will the Abbot find A readier hand. Gurmo. He knows not what I know. Edwin. What dost thou know? Gurmo. Hark! hear you not, my Lord? Trumpets and shouts! Anon they storm the Tower. Edwin. 'Tis Athulf's cry! the guards are gone! 'Tis he! Scene V. —A Garden within the walls of Chester Castle. Elgiva (alone). How pleasant it might seem to a bird of the air Passing upon the wing, or aught that's free, In this delightful garden to abide, And be a captive ever. Make me free And I myself should linger on this ground Reluctant to depart. But as I am The shadow of the imprisoned spirit falls On everything around; the warbling thrush Is tedious in the telling of his loves, The perfume of the wallflower taints the air. And yet in much of this adornment lurks A lover's hand. They gave me to the ward Of age and bitterness in Ruold's father, Forgetting Ruold's father had a son. I am his captive and he mine, poor youth! For though they stripped me of my royalties, In the prerogatives of beauty still I found myself acknowledged. Ah! he comes. He shall have audience. No, he's not alone. I'll hide my head awhile. 'Tis Sigeric. [Retires into an arbour. Enter Ruold and Sigeric. Sigeric. The King thus rescued from that imminent fate, The cry was now for Dunstan. Where was he? For with his traitorous head should he atone The meditation of that mortal blow Which he had all but dealt. So where was he? Gone! vanished! not a footstep to be found! Whether by transformation magical, Or subterranean egress, to which he, And no one else, was privy,—how none knew, But gone he was; and Sidroc in pursuit Went babbling like a buckhound all abroad That vainly seeks the slot. His creature, too, Gruff Gurmo, disappeared. Ruold. Ere long, be sure, He will be heard of. Sigeric. Should he gain the coast, 'Tis thought he'll cross to Flanders. Either way The Primate, unto whom the King speaks fair, Demurs not to his banishment, if so The kingdom's wounds be healed; and with this word He sends me to be present on his part At Edgar's Witenagemót. When meets it? Ruold. 'Tis summoned for the Vigil of St. Chad At Malpas, whither is my father gone Since yesterday. He went ensuing peace, Constrained, though last to be constrained, to own That peace is needful. Not a day but teems With tidings of the Dane. He threatens now The coasts of Somerset and Severn's mouth. This, with the loss of Dunstan from our ranks, And Odo's inclination, looks one way. Sigeric. I think it brings us peace. Ruold. Which seen, my friend, Advise me, I beseech you. What results? A peace is made, my father last to join The general voice, and odious more than others As the Queen's gaoler—how shall fare his head? Sigeric. He must be cared for in the composition; An amnesty for all, and him by name, Must stand upon the treaty. Ruold. Who shall trust it? My friend, the terms that I would trust are terms For service rendered. Sigeric. If I know your drift, You would let loose the Queen. Ruold. And wherefore not? Sigeric. As servant of the Primate and the State, I say God speed you in your bold intent. In private, as your father's friend and yours, I bid you to beware. If peace be made, And you have still been constant to your charge, It is but, at the worst, uncertainties That hang about you. But if peace be missed, And you have set at large this royal pledge, The very aim and purport of the war, It shall be then no question nor surmise What shall befall you. Ruold. If no risk were run, Where were the service that could claim reward? Keep you my counsel for my father's sake, And if at Malpas when you meet the Witan You hear a rumour of the Queen escaped, Call it a misadventure and mischance. Sigeric. Save what shall reach me when I'm gone from hence I shall know nought. God send you well to fare! [Exit. Ruold. I thank you, worthy Sigeric. Farewell. Elgiva! Royal mistress! Beautiful Queen! Would that the danger to my head were more, Lest you should deem it but a politic cast, And not a loyal venture. Re-enter Elgiva. Elgiva. My good Ruold, 'Twas Sigeric went from you, was it not? What tidings brought he? Ruold. Madam, he confirms Our yesterday's intelligence. The King Is rescued by Earl Athulf. Dunstan fled. And this besides,—Ethilda is betrothed With solemn ceremonial to the Earl, Though yet the nuptials are not; for the Pope To Dunstan only gave authority The sentence which he uttered to revoke; And whilst the Earl is excommunicate The Princess to the marriage rite demurs. Elgiva. Her heart was ever scrupulous, and splits Betwixt the Pope and Athulf. Notwithstanding, Athulf will prosper. Ruold, faithful friend, Now must I put thy loyalty to proof. The letters from Earl Leolf that were brought Are full of hope. At Audley is his force, And with a light and deftly mounted troop Ere midnight struck to Tilston could he come, And me, there meeting him, could carry thence, And pass the interspace of hostile ground Ere break of day. No more of doubtful looks, Dear faithful Ruold; I must brush away These cobwebs from thy brow—Ah, now 'tis clear, Free, frank, and bold!—Well, Ruold, what reply? Ruold. My Royal mistress, doubts if I have had, They were not craven nor disloyal doubts; They were but such as fear for you proposed, Not for myself; and now my fears are less, My faith the same; my answer is, then,—go, Go at your gracious pleasure, if your flight Be deemed more safe than your captivity. Elgiva. Oh! I am sick of safety in a prison. Give me that dangerous liberty I seek, And through the tossings of one turbulent night Let me descry the harbour of my home, With waving hands and welcomings of friends, When 'mid the shoutings of the multitude I shoot triumphant o'er the perilous bar And pass at once to gladness and to peace. Ruold. Ev'n be it as you will. But stir not yet. Wait till the Lords have drawn their forces in And gathered to the Witenagemót. Then shall you send to Leolf, and appoint The period of your flight. Elgiva. 'Twill not be long, Good Ruold, will it? I will try to wait. ACT V. Scene I. —A Heath in Hampshire.—Dunstan and Gurmo in flight Dunstan. The night shall shield us like a raven's wing. What hear'st thou in the wind? Gurmo. A moaning cry. Dunstan. Thou faint'st with hunger. Gurmo. Can I fast so long And not be hungry? Dunstan. 'Tis a wolf that cries, And he is hungry too. Make forward still. Gurmo. I see a light. Dunstan. Hist! in the lull of the wind I hear the stroke of hammers. On apace! It is a blacksmith's forge. I'll harbour there. Scene II. —A Blacksmith's Forge.—The Blacksmith at work. Serfs and Boors dropping in, with a Monk and others. Blacksmith. (blowing the bellows and singing). But now I wax old, Sick, sorry, and cold, Like much upon mould I widder away. 1st Boor. Look, thou horse-cobbler; call'st thou this a shoe? I know thee; since the slaughter at the ford Thou'rt warming old ones up. Blacksmith. Oh me, st. Giles! 2nd Boor. And mark this coulter; look you at this mattock. Monk. Repent and do thy work more workmanlike, Or in a twinkling him shalt thou behold That came to holy Dunstan's forge unbid And staid unwilling. Marry, Sir, thy tongs Would touch him not, and he is roaming now Through all the land. 3rd Boor. 'Tis true; I saw myself The print of his hoof. 'Twas in Dame Umfrieg's garth, And Father Egelpig discovered it. 'Twas like a goat's. Monk. My son, he's there and here And everywhere, since that most holy man, The Abbot Dunstan, by the godless King Was forced to fly. 4th Boor. I've sent for Father Crid To bless and exorcise my cattle and swine. Monk. Thou hast done well; but thy best safety lies In holy Dunstan's prayers. At Winchester Ye heard how in the west end of the church, The night that Dunstan fled, the Devil skipped And with great laughter in his roaring fashion Took up his “O be joyful!” Who are these? A brother of mine order is the one. If I mistake not. Benedicite! Enter Dunstan and Gurmo. Dunstan. God save you! holy brother: sons, and you! We seek for shelter from the coming storm. Blacksmith. Father, you're welcome. Monk. Come ye from the south? Dunstan. From London last. Monk. From London? yea, indeed! What tidings bring ye then? Dunstan. What would ye know? Monk. Canst thou be so insensible to ask? The holy Abbot Dunstan—where is he? What fate attends him? Dunstan. That we know not yet. Blacksmith. A price is on his head—ten thousand marks. Lilla, the King's Gerefa of the shire, Proclaim'd it far and wide. Dunstan. Give me thy hammer; Thou canst not make a coulter so; look here; Strike endways—thus—and thus. What said the shire To Lilla's proffer? Was it hailed with joy? Monk. Torn down and trampled in the mud. This shire Will yield them many a Peter with his sword, But ne'er a Judas. Dunstan. Is the shire so hot In Dunstan's cause? Monk. It kindles hourly. Nay, 'Tis said that Lilla and his men were met On Chilton-down by fifteen hundred boors And scantly saved themselves by flight. 1st Boor. 'Tis true; 'Twas Titchburne township that turn'd out the first: But we of Droxford will be up betimes; See if we be not. Dunstan. If ye be, my friends, The Abbot will be presently amongst you; For this way comes he, having in his mind To cross the sea to Flanders. But, my friends, If ye be hearty in the cause of God Ye will not let him go. Shame to this shire, Shame be to England and to Christendom, If he that fasted and that watched for you, And day by day to save your perishing souls Flayed his poor body streaming down with blood,— Shame to your country and yourselves, if he Should flee before the wicked! Boors. We'll rise! we'll rise! It never shall be said. He shall not flee. Dunstan. He will not, if ye stead him in his peril. But ye must be alert. Go forth this night, This very night go forth, and call your friends In all the hamlets round, to meet at Stoke By dawn to-morrow. Thither Dunstan comes, And ye shall bid him go no further forth. Monk. What! Dunstan's very self? will he be there? Dunstan. I say he will. 2nd Boor. Then, mattock, go thy ways; I'll run to meet him. 3rd Boor. All—we all must run. We all have souls. Monk. Come to the abbey first, And ye shall have your doublets lined with mead, Wherewith defended ye may face the storm, Flying from house to house, and send the news From village on to village. Blacksmith. And, father, you, And this your friend, shall rest the while with me. Scene III. —Derby. Edwin and Athulf. Athulf. With patience we shall prosper. That alone Is wanting to us now. Edwin. Nay, do not chide. I have been patient, Athulf, in my cell; Patient of wrongs and cruelties and threats, Sickness and imminent death; but this is worse; To be at large, and yet be checked and curbed, When now my wife's deliverance only waits On my advance. Athulf. With measured speed we pass To an assured result; with hurried steps We should but bring the shadow of a host To issues that would then be full of doubt. Our marches are too hasty, and the force Begins to break. Pause, I beseech you. Edwin. Well; You are a soldier tried in many a field; And I am but a King. Have, then, your way. Athulf. So please you, then, pass onward to the front, Whilst I hang back and gather up the rear. Scene IV. —Audley in Staffordshire. Leolf and Emma. Emma. Could not the Queen await the coming up Of the King's army? Must she hazard yours? Leolf. My army moves not. A few mounted thanes Alone go with me. No, she hazards nought,— Nought that is worth a care, except herself. Emma. She hazards all. Leolf. True, for her safety's sake I could have wished her to let time declare What should ensue at Malpas. But the signs Bid fair for peace, and barring misadventure . . . Emma. 'Tis a rash reckoning in such times as these That bars a misadventure. Leolf. Nay, not so. With Dunstan fled the spirit of the storm, And Indiscretion, that was fain to hide Its battered plumage, now may gambol forth On bolder wing.—Earl Sidroc, by my life! Welcome to Audley! Enter Sidroc. Sidroc. Nay, Lord Heretoch, nay; Before you make me welcome, hear my news. Leolf. No, you are welcome. If your news be bad, Welcome the more, for then the more's the need Of your good counsel. Sidroc. Dunstan is at large— Nay more, has joined the Witenagemót. I chased him to the coast, where in a night The boors of Hampshire rose five thousand strong And snatched him from my hands. Leolf. At Malpas now! Already there! Sidroc. I fear he is indeed. But have you then no tidings? Hear you not From Malpas? Leolf. We had looked to hear anon. There comes a fellow with an open mouth And eager eye. Enter Messenger. The sequel? Speak, my friend; What more beside the message in thy face? Messenger. The Abbot is at Malpas. Leolf. That we knew, Or nearly knew. What did he then when there? Messenger. He called the Witenagemót together And bade them never more to speak of peace Until the Church were founded in her rights. Leolf. And he was heard? Messenger. By some he was opposed That stood around him, but the floor fell in And they went headlong; on the only beam That brake not, Dunstan, standing undismayed, Stretched forth his arm and bade the multitude Confess the hand of God. Sidroc. By Peter's Keys Another miracle and a murder too Done by this cunning carpenter! Leolf. What next Needs not be asked. Peace was renounced, no doubt? Messenger. It was, my Lord. Emma. The salvage may be high, But something there is saved by this. The Queen Will now sit close. Leolf. I know not that; foul winds Preach patience; but adversity, to some So sedative, to others is a goad. Aught that disturbs her, hurries her to act. —Then hears the King her husband of her peril, And he is hurried past his reason too.— I pray you come. But, Ernway, get you ready To carry letters south. [Exeunt Leolf and Sidroc. Emma. Now will he write Commending care and patience to the King, And take the danger solely to himself. But think you, Seneschal, the Earl's dear life Should thus be thrown amongst the enemy And all of us behind? Seneschal. What else can I? Emma. Why this: So soon as he is gone, the force Is at thy order—move it on to Lea, Whence thou canst see, if aught ensue amiss, To Leolf's safe return. Seneschal. Nay, but the King, If he be patient to the Heretoch's wish, Will be but late to join us though we wait; And should we move . . . Emma. The King will follow fast Once he shall know you gone; which that he shall In all its import know, trust to my care, For I will forth with Ernway, and perchance In this affair my counsel with the King Shall weigh as heavy as the Heretoch's. Scene V. —Malpas.—Dunstan surrounded by Ealdermen and Military Leaders of the Monastic Party. Dunstan. No more of Witenagemóts—no more— Councils and courts we want not.—Get ye back, Back to your posts, and pluck me forth your swords, And let me hear your valiant deeds resound, And not your empty phrases. Ecfrid, Gorf, Look to your charges—Nantwich stands exposed— Whitchurch lies open to the enemy— Burley and Baddeley have sold themselves— Wistaston is as naked as Godiva And not so honest. Eadbald, Ida, Brand, What seek ye here when honour is in the field? Forth to your charges!—What! Ceolwulf too! Enter the Coastwardens, Ceolwulf and Æthelric. And Æthelric! Why come ye hither, Sirs? Must ye too have your parley and your prate And leave your charges in extremity To join this gossiping Gemót? St. Bride! Is Somerset not worth your pains, my Lords, Or hath the Dane, too, from the seaboard slunk To prattle about peace? Ceolwulf. Lord Abbot, hear; We are not come . . . Dunstan. Not come to pule and prate? What are ye come for? If aught else ye seek, Ye seek it where it is not. Back to your charge! Æthelric. You will not hear, my Lord; we have no charge— We have no force; our men are slain, ourselves Escaped by miracle; the Northmen, led By Sweyne and Olaf, landed yesternight In Porlock Bay and clipped us round at Stoke, And thinned as we had been, we fell perforce An easy prey. Not twenty men are left To tell the tale. Dunstan. In Porlock Bay! At Stoke! —Have I not bid you to your posts, my Lords, And must I bid you twice? Get ye hence all. If news ye came for, ye have heard it.—Stop, Ceolwulf. Whither go the Northmen next? Ceolwulf. To Glastonbury it is thought, my Lord. Dunstan. To Glastonbury do they go? Alas! My mother there lies sick. Scene VI. —Ashborn in Derbyshire. Edwin and Athulf. Edwin. Still this is gained,—the everlasting word “Halt!” shall be heard no more; and never more Shall my heart sicken at its detested sound. Now, thinking of Elgiva close at hand, We shall be filled with her victorious cheer. Athulf. I would to God that I could think her wise. All is in jeopardy through her. By Heaven! I know not which is worst—to come too late, Or come with broken strength. Edwin. To come too late Is worst by far. When Leolf went from Audley 'Tis true he bade us to beware of haste; But then he knew not that the enemy's force Would move on Nantwich, thus, with his at Lea, To bring them cheek-by-jowl, whilst us it leaves More laggard than we were. Athulf. I'll stake my head 'Twas ne'er by Leolf's wish his force was moved So far as Lea; but be it so or not, 'Twas moved in error; it can bring no aid To Leolf and Elgiva; nay, I fear, 'Twill draw the forces of the enemy down Upon the very wayside of their flight. Still moved it is, and I deny not now That we should follow at our best of speed. Scene VII. —Night. A Coppice near Acton in Cheshire. —In front is a mortstone. Enter certain Retainers and Servants of Leolf. 1st Servant. This is the road; bring up the horses, ho! Hark! heard'st thou aught? If Dunstan knew, my friends, He'd ope his book and read a verse of power, And send a goblin that should . . . 2nd Servant. Hush! thou fool! Is it not hither the Earl should come? 1st Servant. 'Tis here, Six furlongs from the chapel. What is this? Oh me! the mortstone! No, it is not here; 'Tis further on. 3rd Servant. Seest thou not something white? 1st Servant. Jesu Maria, save us! 'tis a Spirit. [Exeunt. Enter Leolf and Elgiva. Leolf. Fresh horses should have met us here; what chance Hath hindered them, I know not; we must wait Till these be rested. Here is a rude stone-seat; We may rest likewise. Elgiva. Is there danger still? Leolf. But little here; the dangers of the road, I trust, are left behind. Elgiva. Oh, Leolf! much I owe you, and if aught a kingdom's wealth Affords, could pay the debt . . . Leolf. A kingdom's wealth! Elgiva! by the heart the heart is paid. You have your kingdom, my heart has its love. We are provided. Elgiva. Oh! in deeds so kind, And can you be so bitter in your words! Have I no offerings of the heart, wherewith Love's service to requite? Leolf. The least of boons Scattered by royal charity's careless hand O'erpays my service; to requite the rest All you possess is but a bankrupt's bond. This is the last time we shall speak together; Forgive me, therefore, if my speech be bold And need not an expositor to come. I loved you once; and in such sort I loved That anguish has but burnt the image in And I must bear it with me to my grave. I loved you once; dearest Elgiva, yes, Ev'n now my heart is feeding on that love As in its flower and freshness, ere the grace And beauty of the fashion of it perished. It was too anxious to be fortunate, And it must now be buried, self-embalmed Within my breast, or living there recluse Talk to itself and traffic with itself; And like a miser that puts nothing out And asks for no return, must I tell o'er The treasures of the past. Elgiva. Can no return Be rendered? And is gratitude then nothing? Leolf. To me 'tis nothing—being less than love; But cherish it as to your own soul precious; The heavenliest lot that earthly natures know Is to be affluent in gratitude. Be grateful and be happy. For myself, If sorrow be my portion, yet shall hope, That springs from sorrow and aspires to heaven, Be with me still. When this disastrous war Is ended, I shall quit my country's shores A pilgrim and a suitor to the love Which dies not nor betrays.—What cry is that? I thought I heard a voice. Elgiva. Oh, Leolf, Leolf! So tender, so severe! Leolf. Mistake me not; I would not be unjust; I have not been; Now less than ever could I be, for now A sacred and judicial calmness holds Its mirror to my soul; at once disclosed The picture of the past presents itself Minute yet vivid, such as it is seen In his last moments by a drowning man. Look at this skeleton of a once green leaf; Time and the elements conspired its fall; The worm has eaten out the tenderer parts And left this curious anatomy Distinct of structure—made so by decay; So at this moment lies my life before me In all its intricacies, all its errors, And can I be unjust? Elgiva. Oh, more than just, Most merciful in judgment have you been, And ev'n in censure kind. Leolf. Our lives were linked By one misfortune and a double fault. It was my folly to have fixed my hopes Upon the fruitage of a budding heart; It was your fault,—the lighter fault by far,— Being the bud to seem to be the berry. The first inconstancy of unripe years Is nature's error on the way to truth. But, hark! another cry! they call us hence; Why come they not to us? Hark! Hist! again! A clash of swords! Our band then is beset; Alas, Elgiva! Elgiva. Leolf, we are lost. Say, is it so? I am not afraid; but, oh! Forgive me, Leolf, for I have wronged in you The noblest of your kind. Oh, Edwin! . . . Leolf, Tell him that I was true till death to him, Though sometime false to you. Leolf. Fly, fly, Elgiva! Our horses are at hand—we still may fly. Scene VIII. —Lea in Cheshire. Edwin, Athulf, and Sidroc. Sidroc. Neither of them nor those that with them went Nor those that went to meet them, can I glean One grain of tidings. Even lies are scarce And false reports arrive not. Athulf. They are lost. Edwin. Peace, Athulf! If you would not I lost heart Now, when my courage will be needed most, Speak not that word again. They shall be found. Let us but march on Malpas. Sidroc. By the way It may be we shall meet them. But if news Of them be wanting, of the Danes 'tis rife. In Somerset, which now they leave behind, Town, hamlet, monastery, church and grange, Lie smoking; and at Glastonbury Sweyne Wasted the Abbot's lands, his treasure took, And scared his bedrid mother, that she fled, Though seized with mortal sickness. Athulf. Hurt to her Strikes at the human corner of his heart. Sidroc. Upon him now, then, while his cheer is low. Athulf. Oh, Sidroc! what is ours? Edwin. Nay, hope the best; Sidroc is right; on Malpas let us march, Sending the women to our friends in Wales. Scene IX. —Malpas. Bridferth and Ruold. Bridferth. He is in much perplexity of mind; You cannot see him. Since his mother's death He comes not from his chamber, save at night When the sad brethren of St. Benedict Say masses for her soul. Ruold. His mother dead! Bridferth. At Glastonbury she lay sick, and thence Driven by the Dane, the terror of her flight, Conspiring with her malady, put out Her spark of life. To her great son she sent Her dying charge that he as best he might Should heal his country's wounds and give it peace, And rescue from the Northmen's ravages Its poor remains. Ruold. Indeed! His mother dead! Well, had he lost ten mothers ten times told Still must I see him. Bridferth. What's your errand, then, That is so instant? Of the Queen's escape He knows already. Ruold. That is not the last Nor yet the sharpest of the untoward strokes That destiny hath dealt us. What I know I fear to tell, save to the Abbot's self. But, lo, he comes! And by my life I shrink From telling it to him. Stand back a space. [They retire. Dunstan enters. Dunstan. Why did I quit the cloister? I have fought The battles of Jehovah; I have braved The perfidies of courts, the wrath of Kings, Desertion, treachery,—and I murmured not,— The fall from puissance, the shame of flight, The secret knife, the public proclamation,— And how am I rewarded? God hath raised New enemies against me,—from without The furious Northman,—from within, far worse, Heart-sickness and a subjugating grief. She was my friend—I had but her—no more, No other upon earth—and as for Heaven, I am as they that seek a sign, to whom No sign is given. My mother! Oh, my mother! —Who's this? What are you, Sir? What brings you here? Oh, ho! I know you; you are Ruold; well, What news from Chester? Easy watch you kept Upon Elgiva. Let that pass. What more? Your father's merits have redeemed your head That else was forfeited. Ruold. Lord Abbot, still It stands a forfeit, if adversity, Loss and disaster make a forfeiture. Chester is burnt. The Dane came up the Dee, And landing in the night, ere break of day Slew half my force and fired the town. Dunstan. So! so! Deemedst thou that this should jeopardize thy head? Far otherwise. But send Harcather here. This news is welcome. [Exeunt Ruold and Bridferth. Is it not welcome? Yes; It rings a shrill alarum in mine ears, Telling me that the murderers of my mother Are come to judgment. Give me back, O God, My health of heart, and waken me to wield The weapons of thine anger. Oh, my mother! Thy deathbed was illuminate from Heaven And in the glory of prophetic light Thy soul departed. From thy place thou seest Thy word fulfilled—the Heathen hems us round— Next shalt thou see thy son perform thy bidding, And gathering into one the broken force Of this divided realm, with headlong might Reject the Northmen to their native rocks. Enter Harcather. Harcather, we are threatened, hear'st thou not? The raven that was watching from afar Our mortal throes, deems that she now can tear The body of the land. Nay, ravenous Dane, We are not yet exanimate. Let all That ever dreamt that they were Christians, join To fight against these robbers of the sea And hurl them backward to their brine. Proclaim A peace betwixt King Edwin and the Church— In furtherance whereof will I divulge Letters of absolution for those Earls And others that are excommunicate. Send me a Herald to King Edwin's camp. What staggering knave is this, with bloodstain'd pate And livid lips? 'Tis Gurmo. What bring'st thou? The Queen? Where is she? Hast thou got her safe? He cannot speak. Gurmo (who has entered). Lord Abbot, she is dead. Dunstan. Dead! By what chance? Alive I bid thee take her, And wherefore is she dead? Gurmo. Her horse was fleet, But fleeter is an arrow than a horse. An arrow from my bow is in her heart. And Leolf, too, is slain. But lo! I bleed; For ere they slew him, I was hurt to death And by his hand. Short shrift for me I wot! A priest—a priest—not you, Lord Abbot, no— King Edwin now comes rushing on—look out Or you shall be surprised. Dunstan. Harcather, fly; The forces that are scattered draw together And plant them close and strong. A Herald send, I say again, with overtures to Edwin, Inviting him to peace. A priest, good Gurmo? No, 'tis myself must shrive thee; to my cell Supporthim. Is he dead? Not yet—not yet. Scene X. —A Village on the Borders of Wales. Ethilda, Emma, Ernway, and Sidroc. Sidroc. To Ernway's escort must I leave you now, Lest my return should find a foughten field And not a field to fight. The road is safe, And Ruthin Castle you will reach ere long, With a warm welcome from the good Ap Rhys. Ethilda. When shall the tidings of the battle come To Ruthin Castle? Sidroc. When to-morrow's sun Behind the summit of Llanvarroch sinks, Look down the valley. If the day be won, A white flag flying in a horseman's hand Shall fan you from afar, and kindle joy In all your hearts. Emma. No, never more in mine. Sidroc. If it be lost, perchance you shall descry Some remnant that may fight their way to Wales, In shelter of the mountains to abide Till better times. Ethilda. Commend me to the King, And tell Earl Athulf I am strong in hope, Rejoicing alway in his absolution, And trusting we shall meet to part no more. Scene XI. —The Walls of Malpas. Dunstan, Harcather, and a Messenger. Dunstan. “The Dane! The Dane!” Why pesterest thou mine ears With that perpetual cry? How face the Dane, Not knowing yet if Edwin be for peace? Harcather. For peace, Lord Abbot! nay, he cannot choose. Dunstan. Let me know that, I say; let me know that. See ye the Herald coming? Messenger. Ay, my Lord. Harcather. At Herald's pace; these fellows dream and prance Ever as in a pageant and procession. Dunstan. I bade him,—when in sight of Edwin's camp. Harcather. If he be now in sight thereof, that camp Is nearer than we thought. It may be so. Messenger. But lo! he pricks his prancing to a gallop; And see, my Lord, from forth the valley's gorge Issues a cloud of dust. Harcather. By Egbert's bones It is the dust of Edwin's army. Stay— A gleam comes through it—run thou to my son, And bid him lead the vanguard out forthwith. Send me my horse. Dunstan. What think'st thou? Is it war? Harcather. Else wherefore this advance? To horse! to horse! Dunstan. Stop; be not hasty; now the Herald comes; Hear we his tale. Herald enters. Well, Sir, what saith the King? Herald. He saith, my Lord, what I should but blaspheme Should I recite it. Dunstan. What! thine office, Herald! Speak me the very words. Herald. My Lord, he saith That with a bloody and a barbarous hand You have torn out the very sweetest life That ever sanctified humanity. He saith that should he covenant to make peace With the revolted Angels, yet with you He would not; for he deems you more accursed And deeper in perdition. And he saith Not she that died at Gibeah, whose twelve parts Sent several through the borders and the coasts Raised Israel, was avenged more bloodily Than shall Elgiva be, the murder'd Queen. Wherefore he bids you come to battle forth, And add another crime or answer this. Dunstan. Harcather, hear'st thou? To the field—away! The gates of Hell stand wider than their wont To let this infidel and his army pass! Scene XII. —Before the Walls of Malpas.—The left of the field. Alarums and skirmishing. Enter Athulf and Sidroc with forces. Athulf. Three minutes till the rearward force is up— Halt for three minutes—Sidroc, look, oh, look! The King is plunging madly forward still; Either an ambush he will find or else They'll lure him through the gates. Go to him, Sidroc. Sidroc. No need of ambush for that headlong boy; A town is not so manifest a trap But it shall catch him. Athulf. Fly, then, to his side, And bring him back. I cannot go myself, For now the rearward gathers up behind, And lo! Harcather comes against us. Charge! Scene XIII. —Before the Walls of Malpas.— The right of the field. A body of Monks are seen ranged on the walls, holding up crosses and relics. In front, Edwin with forces. Edwin. Nay, stagger ye at a show of hoods and gowns! It is a murderer's disguise, I say, And not a Christian's garb.—What spectre foul Is you that rises o'er the ruined wall? I see the accursed Abbot's skinny hand Held up aloft! Now God befriend the right! Scene XIV. —Before the Walls of Malpas.—The left of the field. Alarums and a retreat sounded. Athulf with a remnant of his force, and Ruold. Athulf. I knew you not; why pressed you thus upon us, Alone and wounded as you are? Fall back. Ruold. I seek my death,—but, Athulf, not from you. Athulf. Oh, gentle Ruold, in my sister's right I bid you live. Ruold. Her spirit calls me hence. Had I been resolute, she had lived to-day. Farewell, brave Athulf. You have lost your King. [Exit. Athulf. It shall not be. Nay, hold your ground, my friends; Turn on them—'tis the last time—ay, the last— Lo! there Earl Sidroc gallops from the right To tell us if the King can yet be saved. Stand fast but till he comes. Crossbow-men, see! They round the hill, the villains! Shoot together— There flies the sleet that whistles in their beards— Charge once again—no archery like yours! And here comes Sidroc. Well, how fares the King? Enter Sidroc. Sidroc. Outwitted, lost, inveigled, snared, and worse, If worse it be, wounded—they say to death. Soon as the execrable shape appeared Of Dunstan on the walls, the tempest rose Upon his heart and drave him to his fate. Athulf, away! for longer now to stand Were worse than vain. Athulf. They circle us about, But we shall break their circle to their cost. Well have ye battled for your King, brave hearts! And now I bid you but to save yourselves. Look not too narrowly at the fence, but leap; And if it chance, as like enough it may, That we be scattered, we shall meet again At Ruthin, whither is the Princess fled. Round her we rally. Ride, Sirs, for your lives. Scene XV. —Malpas.—Interior of the Cathedral. Candles burning and altars decked as for a service of thanksgiving. A corpse lies on a bier in the transept, and the chaunting of a service for the dead is heard at intervals from a side-chapel. Monks enter in procession, and lastly Dunstan. Dunstan. So flee the works of darkness. Sing ye the psalm “Quid gloriaris.”—Stop: a hasty step Rings in the cloister. Enter a Soldier. Soldier. I am bid, my Lord, To seek the Lord Harcather, for his son Ruold is slain. Dunstan. Silence! no more of that; Harcather is gone forth to meet the Dane; Let him not know it yet. Enter Bridferth. Well, Bridferth, well? Bridferth. Athulf and Sidroc have escaped, my Lord, The prisoners say, and as I learn elsewhere, Doing much havoc in their desperate flight. Dunstan. 'Tis true. I thought no less.—What corse is this? A Monk. The Queen's, my Lord, awaiting burial. Dunstan. Hers?— Withdraw the winding-sheet, that once again I may behold her.—Art thou she indeed! The blankness of mortality in thee Seems more than in another. Where be now The flushings of the fervent cheek, the fires That lightened from those eyes! Oh, rueful sight! Methinks that thou dost look reproachfully. Not me—not me—upbraid not me, pale Queen! I slew thee not, nor yet desired thy death; I would have willed thee to repent and live, But lo! the will of God hath mastered mine. Chaunt from the side-chapel. “Quando caro sepelitur, Heu! de spiritu nil scitur, Utrum gaudet an punitur. “Quis orabit pro delicto? Quis spondebit pro convicto? Quis judicio tam stricto Fiet in præsidium?” Dunstan —Better be so than be the living cause Of death eternal and a nation's lapse To mortal sin. Nor sin nor sorrow now Hath power upon thee; nor canst thou, fair mask, Be ever more their minister. Enter an Attendant. Attendant. My Lord, The King, so please you— Dunstan. What, Sir, of the King? Attendant. He is again delirious, and hath torn The bandage from his wound. He bleeds amain. Chaunt again. “Et si pœnas infernales Agnovisses, quæ et quales, Tuos utique carnales Appetitus frangeres; “Et innumera peccata, Dicta, facta, cogitata, Mente tota consternata Merito deplangeres.” Enter another Attendant. Attendant. My Lord, the King, the King! Dunstan. What! comes he hither? Enter Edwin, followed by a Physician and Attendants. Edwin. Where art thou, my beloved? Come to me! Art thou not here? They said so, but 'twas false— Thou art not here, for if thou wert, I know Thou'dst fly to meet me.—Ha! I see thee now— And yet thou mov'st not. What! in chains again! Not so, Elgiva—thou art free, my love— I smote them with the sword. Oh, come to me! Give me thy hand. Dunstan. Doctor, thou mad'st report The fever had abated. The Physician. Had, my Lord; But rages now afresh. Dunstan. How came he hither? Attendant. He asked us if the Queen were buried yet, Or where the body lay; we told him, here; And he commanded we should bring him. Dunstan. See! Edwin. Thy hand is very cold.—Come, come, look up. Hast not a word to say to so much love? Well—as thou wilt—but 'twas not always thus. So soon to be forgotten! Oh, so soon! And I have loved so truly all this while!— I dream—I do but dream—I think.—What's here? 'Tis not the dress that thou wert wont to wear. This is a corpse! Attendance, here! What, ho! Who was so bold to bring a stone-cold corpse Into the King's apartment? Stop—be still— I know not that. Give me but time, my friends, And I will tell you. The Physician. Draw him from the corpse: This loss of blood that drains the fever off Anon will bring him to himself. A Monk. My Lord, I hear a shout as of a multitude In the north suburb. Dunstan. Bridferth, mount the tower And look abroad. Edwin. That was a voice I knew— It came from darkness and the Pit—but hark! An Angel's song . . . 'Tis Dunstan that I see! Rebellious monk! I lay my body down Here at thy feet to die, but not my soul, Which goes to God. The cry of innocent blood Is up against thee, and the Avenger's cry Shall answer it. Support me, Sirs, I pray; Be patient with me . . . there was something still . . . I know not what . . . under your pardon . . . yes . . . Touching my burial . . . did I not see but now Another corpse . . . I pray you, Sirs, . . . there . . . there . . . [Dies. Bridferth (from the tower).

Scene I. —The Palace of the Comneni. Isaac Comnenus and Macrinus. Comnenus. It will not keep, Macrinus; in such things There is a rotten ripeness supervenes On the first moment of maturity. Macrinus. I well believe, my Lord, that more such schemes Have failed from over-wariness than rashness. Comnenus. Then be our last convention held to-night; And see that all be summoned. Macrinus. I'll look to it. Comnenus. And I must to the palace. Macrinus. The worse errand. Comnenus. It is unseasonable, but not dangerous. I know Nicephorus well; his roof is safe; He'd rather that an accident befell me In any place than there. Macrinus. I hope, my Lord, You put not too much trust in Theodora. Comnenus. In her? no—little enough. I could secure her, But having not a stomach to the means, I fain would fancy that I do not want her. Here comes a Lordling of her train. Good-day. Enter Germanus. Germanus. My noble Lord, the Cæsarissa waits With infinite impatience to behold you: She bids me say so. Ah! most noble Count! A fortunate man—the sunshine is upon you— Comnenus. Ay, Sir, and wonderfully warm it makes me. Tell her I'm coming, Sir, with speed. Farewell. [Exit Germanus. Didst thou take heed of yon homunculus? Macrinus. Ay, my Lord, I marked him. Comnenus. We work in the dark and know not what we do; He that begot him meant him for a man, And yet thou seest the issue. After dusk, As soon as may be after dusk, Macrinus, We meet again. Scene II. —The Palace of the Cæsars. Nicephorus and Theodora. Nicephorus. The Count not yet arrived! still more and more He shows a purposed tardiness. Theodora. Not he! 'Tis not his way to measure out the time As huxtering the minutes. Nicephorus. True—but still . . . The tidings that Alexius is recalled Cannot have reached him yet? Theodora. Surely they cannot. Nicephorus. Unless by treachery. Theodora. Whom suspect you now? Nicephorus. Nay, no one—none—but yet it may be so; And he might thence surmise some ill intent Was harboured here against him. Theodora. If he should It were more like he came before the time Than lingered. But you bear an evil mind Towards him, and 'tis looking in that glass You see distrust and thence suspect suspicion. Nicephorus. On both sides cause enough; but none so blind As they that will not see. Theodora. And none so lost As they that know not and that will not know How dangerous is fear. By phantoms scared You left the safe and sought the perilous road, And you have found it. Nicephorus. Perils there may be; But such as I shall know the end of soon. 'Tis time this tampering with an enemy Should cease. 'Tis now a tedious half-year That it has stumbled on to humour thee, And thou art not content. Theodora. To humour me! Yes, 'twas my humour that your head and crown Should not be ventured in a needless strife Nor staked for sport. Nicephorus. Thou answerest idly, child. The strife will come—more desperate by delay. Advances have been made, if seemly all, Or less than seemly some, I spare to speak; And not by deed, I doubt if ev'n by word, Is aught vouchsafed that we can call a pledge. Theodora. Count Isaac's lightest words mean something more Than in court-currency they pass for. You Nor any man beside can say how far His heart is pledged. Nicephorus. Why, thus much may be said; Were it his choice to join his house to mine And take a safe succession for thy dower, Knowing the contract might be made at once, Nought would be left in doubt. All the light words Of courtesy on which thou build'st thy hopes Do but dissimulate the other choice— A choice resolved—to wit, to try his strength With ours in war. Theodora. 'Tis you drive on the trial; He never would have sought it, so your fears Had let him live in peace; but evermore You feared and feared till dangerous you made him. Nicephorus. Have I not shown him every favour due— Ordered the triumph for his victories, Myself partaking the festivities? Theodora. ‘Twould scarcely be acknowledged as it ought Since that ill accident, the taster's death Who tasted of the cup you proffered him. Nicephorus. Ill accidents are ever in thy mouth. Theodora. And since his triumph in the frontier war, What has been wanting—what but open strife, To bid him be prepared for self-defence? Have you not loosed the hydra of the State— Have you not stirred the vermin of the Church— Made compact with the natural enemies Of order and of empire to molest him? And you would have him move no step to meet you? Nicephorus. Too many steps—too many and too long, Too many strides Count Isaac has advanced That ever he should stay his foot in peace Short of the throne. An enemy he is, And as such must be dealt with. Cease not thou, Meantime, to show him favour. But beware Thou lead'st to no surmise that aught impends . . . That aught . . . I bid thee once again beware That thou endanger not thy filial faith. It is not fitting that I meet him now: Wherefore, thus warned, I leave thee. [Exit. Theodora. Warned, and feared. Had I been trusted freely from the first A better claim to my good faith were his. Where trust is not, there treachery cannot be. Were but the Count as quick to apprehend My leaning to his side, as long has been My father to suspect my falling off, We had ere this been better understood Each of the other. He shall know me now. Enter Comnenus. Enough, Count Isaac, rise; you still forget The well-deserved exemption you enjoy From all except the first prostration. Comnenus. Ah! Great is my privilege in Byzantium! In truth, to stand upon two legs at court Is what is not infrequently forgotten. Theodora. But tell me, Count—we should have met ere this— Where have you been then? Comnenus. Sleeping out the noon. Theodora. Asleep? Comnenus. Why wherefore not? Sleep, only sleep Houses the fugitive; sleep shuts the door Against the hour's too saucy creditors And bids them rail unheeded and unheard; Sleep bears the flag of truce to foreign foes; Sleep stills intestine discord; what but sleep Can separate the combatants within Till Time and Death may meet and come to terms And arbitrate the sole perpetual peace. Theodora. Oh, it is no time for your race to sleep, Unless it were indeed the sleep of death; And there were tumults in the streets to-day Might all but wake the dead. Comnenus. So noisy were they? 'Tis true there was some shouting in the Forum; It is a trick of the citizens; when it rains And corn is mildew'd, straight we have a swarm Of curious knaves will find us out the cause, And having found, they noise it in the streets, Which makes this outcry. Theodora. Howsoever made It might have kept you wakeful, for your name Bore the chief part. Comnenus. I verily believe it; To-day am I the cause; to-morrow, you; The next day, it may chance, your royal sire. 'Tis all hap-hazard. Theodora. Truly think you so? Then you think wrong; there is a hidden source Of these dissensions: but I know not yet What thanks or whether any should be mine For confidence unsought. Comnenus. Dismiss your doubts; There are two values in a trust reposed; The first, the knowledge from the trust derived; The second, the goodwill of those who give it. For so much as 'tis given in free goodwill I value it. Theodora. Supposing it so given, What then to recompense this free goodwill Would you adventure? Comnenus. Oh, the infinite pain Of hearing an interminable secret— But not upon the instant unprepared, For I must fast a month and pray to God. Meantime I take my leave,—unless perchance There's aught your Highness would command me in? Theodora. You came at leisure—why this haste to go? Is the escaping from my confidence A matter so immediate?—Thankless friend! Comnenus. There you misjudge me: for the warning given You have my thanks; for what remains behind I can surmise its import to this length, That 'tis intelligence more dangerous For you to give than me thus warned to want. I am content: that I am thankful too Time may prove or may not: 'tis true the same. So fare you well. Theodora. For my sake speak you thus? Oh, if my peace you tender,—ay, or my life, Know whence the dangers come that threaten them. I am an Emperor's daughter, but my heart, Imperial if it be, is womanly: One arrow is there and one poisoned cup I have to dread—Oh! turn but them aside And lightly as yourself will I defy All else that can assail me; whilst for you My woman's wit should weave a panoply That nothing could transpierce:—turn them aside And let our counsels be of one accord And we will share the issue. Comnenus. That can we never. Nature has set apart our destinies And each must follow out the course assigned; I mindful of this token of goodwill, Nor you regardless of your household ties. Theodora. Talk you of Nature? Well, then, hear my creed. The strongest ties have Nature's strongest sanction, And if the ties of blood be not the strongest Nature doth abrogate and make them void. Comnenus. Where these are not the strongest which are they That are not frail? Theodora. Most moral Sophist! Say That there were sin, the burden of my sins Is on my conscience, none of it on yours; Then whom concerns it? Comnenus. Happy is the man Who, unpartaking of the evil thing, Reaps the full harvest of another's sins. But then what says the casuist?— Theodora. What he says This is no time to tell. What profits it Thus to make answer in didactic vein To overtures like mine? 'Tis fit you know They touch on life and death. This (learn from me) Is not the time to ponder and to poise, But with a resolute mind to choose your part. Comnenus. Thanks for the words of wisdom! excellent And profitable counsel had this been Were it not that—one melancholy night— So long ago that I but then reposed From my triumphal honours—on this night— Lying awake through indigestion caught At the Imperial board—my part was chosen. Theodora. Then act your part—a rash and obstinate part And like to prove a tragical—act your part; Your life is in my hands; a few words less And it had there been safe—but do your will— Rush headlong to your ruin—I should have known That never was there a Comnenus yet Who would take part with any but his kin Or counsel save of pride that courts a fall And plays at dice with Fate. Comnenus. If so it be,— If it be true mine ancestry and kin Have all so stubbornly maintained this course, It were presumption in my humble self To wander from their ways. But rest assured If nature made us not for facile friends We are not easily made enemies Nor eager in ill-will. So peace be with you. [Exit. Theodora. Great God! preserve my heart from breaking yet And grant me strength to stagger through the world Till I have struck a blow. But can it be? No, he will not be stubborn to the last; 'Tis but his pride, and when his power runs low That feeds it, he will turn to me. If not He'll have an enemy more dangerous Than all that now surround him. Who are you? Enter a Domestic. Domestic. His sacred Majesty commanded me To ask if yet your Highness was at leisure And could attend him? Theodora. Tell him that I come. [Exit Domestic. That is a sleuth-hound sent to pry about And watch my motions. Ay; the time is past For putting trust in me. Scene III. —Streets of Constantinople.—A crowd of Monks, Acolytes, and Citizens of the blue faction. 1st Citizen. Patience, fellow-citizens, I say patience. Let us all be patient; let us all be patient. 1st Monk. I say he is an Iconoclast. 2nd Citizen. Iconoclast! I know not what is Iconoclast! but this I know,—there's no man ever wore a green scarf but deserved hanging in it. 1st Monk. I tell thee he is an Iconoclast if ever one of his house was. Did he not break the head of the holy St. Basil (whose name be glorified!) with the butt end of his lance? 2nd Monk. I say Anathema, I say Anathema, I say Anathema. Body and soul, life and limb, here and hereafter . . . Monks and Acolytes. Anathema esto, Anathema. 1st Citizen. Patience, excellent friends and fellowcitizens! I say let us debate this matter as wise men with patience and silence. 2nd Monk. I say,—body and soul, life and limb, here and hereafter, be he cursed. 3rd Citizen. Then to hell with him at once. 2nd Citizen. Most assuredly, holy father, he shall go to hell. 1st Citizen. Patience, sweet friends; silence, gentle countrymen; patience and silence, I say. I am about to explain this matter to you. 2nd Citizen. Why all this clamour? Silence, and hear the worthy Hypatius. 3rd Citizen. Silence! Why roar and growl ye thus like the bears in the Hippodrome? 1st Citizen. Hem!—We are all agreed in one thing,— that Count Comnenus is to be made an end of. 2nd Citizen. All, all. 3rd Citizen. Agreed, agreed. 1st Citizen. Then having come to the conclusion, which is with us as it were the ground and beginning of the argument, it behoves us to look to the reasons, which are, as I may say, the ways and means of coming to the conclusion. For if you fall to without knowing the reasons, you'll be held for no better than brute beasts; since all your wise men, look ye, when they are resolved upon a thing, have ever sought out the reasons before they began. Now you all know that last year's harvest in Cappadocia was scarce worth the ingathering, and that corn here in Constantinople cannot be had for money. And who is the cause of this, think ye? All. Comnenus, Comnenus. 1st Citizen. And that the Huns and Bulgarians and other such long-haired savages carried fire and sword and bows and arrows and long spear and short spear through the heart, and, as I may say, to the very neck and heels of the Chersonese, and looked a very terrible look at us over the long wall.—And who brought all this about, think ye? All. Comnenus, Comnenus. 1st Citizen. But how did Comnenus bring it about, answer me that?—You're dumb,—you know not. Now hear me. You all know that some years by-gone this Comnenus was out in the Persian war, fighting in as Christian-like a manner as I myself or any of you. Now mark;—after he was taken prisoner, there comes to him in his tent one evening an old man, wrapped in a flowing mantle, and holding, look ye, a cup in one hand and a mighty volume in the other. He was as wicked a Magian as you shall see in all Persia; and he said to him, look ye, he said . . . by the sweat of St. Isidore I have forgotten what he said. But ever since, this Comnenus has been one of your bloody schismatics and heretical murdering villains. All. We know it. We know it. 1st Citizen. Ay, and you know too the holy image of the blessed St. Basil, in the niche over the monks of St. Conon's gate. Now this Comnenus, no farther back than one night I know not when, riding past like a madman with two or three more such heathen pagan knights from over-sea, puts me his lance in the rest with the butt end to the onset, and drives it two inches and a half into St. Basil's eye. 2nd Monk. Anathema esto! All. Anathema! 1st Citizen. Softly! you all know that St. Basil is the Patron Saint of this city; now the case stands here;— will he ever look evenly on this city again? All. Never, never. 1st Citizen. Never while Comnenus is in it. Citizens. We'll drag him out of it, we'll burn him alive. 1st Citizen. But they'll tell you, they of the green faction, that he's a very Socrates, a second Cæsar, and holds your clubs are no better than oaten straws and will not frighten the flies from lighting on your noses. But mark you this—Did Cæsar ever consort with the Magians? Did Cæsar ever hit St. Basil in the eye? Citizens. No, no. 1st Citizen. And though I think he be neither a saint nor a martyr, yet I'll be bound for him he was no blood-thirsty heretic. Why then, if Cæsar was no heretic, a heretic can be no Cæsar. And look ye,—what I say is this,—shall all Constantinople be starved to death because of one man? All. Never, never. Burn his house. Cut his throat. 1st Citizen. Then look ye, what I say is this,—if he be not already fled forth the city gates— Citizens. Stop him, seize him, secure the gates. 2nd Monk. Smite him hip and thigh, hew him in pieces before the Lord. Enter a Eunuch of the Palace. Eunuch. Why do ye flourish your staves in the air, good friends? Worthy father, why dost thou ventilate thy garment in the east wind? Whom seek ye? All. Comnenus, Comnenus. Eunuch. Then your search is not like to be long, for I came before him but half the street's length. 1st Citizen. Count Comnenus, saidst thou! How attended? Eunuch. There is a young officer from the eastern army with him. 2nd Citizen. Armed, armed, saidst thou? Eunuch. Ay, short sword and shirt of mail. 1st Citizen. Fall on him, down with them both! I'll run and make sure of the east gate, lest he make his escape. 2nd Citizen. And I the north. 3rd Citizen. And I the south. [Exeunt all but Fourth and Fifth Citizens. 4th Citizen. Lo you! how they run! to my thinking they are no better than arrant cowards. 5th Citizen. Assuredly they have the gift of running. But if we stay here alone we're dead men. 4th Citizen. No question of it,—dead. 5th Citizen. Come along; they say this Comnenus is sworn friend and minister to the Devil. I tell thee Satan took his Bible-oath to back him out in aught he put his hand to. 4th Citizen. I would go, but that it looks so villanous dastardly. 5th Citizen. Do as thou wilt. Fare thee well! [Exit. Enter Comnenus and an Officer of the Eastern Army. Comnenus. One whom my brother . . . . . . What dost stand i' the way for, friend? 4th Citizen. Nothing, worthy Sir—good day, noble Count. [Exit. Comnenus. One whom my brother holds in trust, to me Is as a brother welcome. More than once I wrote to beg him, should he come at all, To come with what celerity he might; But he outstrips my expectation. Speed, 'Tis true, is needful; you yourself may see The state in which I stand; no day goes by But fills the streets with tumult; even now Methought I saw a flying rack of the storm Scud by to leeward. Say, what think you, Sir? Officer. My Lord, for those that I have seen, they seem The very scum of the city and dregs of the Church. Comnenus. Why so they are—yet these things have their source. You are a soldier, Sir,—ay, and a young one; You would instruct me—for a soldier's dawn Is rich in lights and guidance—you would call These gatherings here and there that rise and break And vanish, worthier of the city watch With whip in hand, than of a soldier's sword. Sir, if these slight imposthumes which you see Were the disease, not, as they are, the symptoms, Think you I'd send so far to have them lanced? This multitude, this monster idiot-born, Moves you not one of its Briarean hands By its own brainless head; but let some chief, Though he be ne'er so base, but whoop them on And they shall follow till the noblest fall. Your master must be nearer ere I move. You left him at Ancyra? Officer. There, my Lord, He waits your further tidings, or will move His somewhat jaded force more gently on. Comnenus. 'Twere good he came no further or came fast. I wrote with some caution, Sir; I'll speak with less; Well knowing whom my brother trusts trustworthy. Tell him that in my mind the time of choice Has slidden from our grasp; tell him that now Our only armour is the crown and purple. Here stands the throne, and there the block—I say To one of these must the Comneni come: Suspicion thus draws down the thing it fears And emperors leave no refuge save in empire. This thou shalt tell my brother is my mind. Say further thus: If having duly weighed the double venture He hold forbearance for the lighter risk, Let him lead back his forces (for myself I'd put the issue on a throw of the dice As lief as on aught else); but so he view These matters as I view them, let him on With all the speed his lightest horse can make To the Propontis on the hither shore, And, barring accidents, I'll meet him there; And you, Sir, too, I hope. Officer. I'll use all speed. Comnenus. When past the city gates; Till then go leisurely and unobserved. I've noted when I send young gallants forth In things of trust and moment, straight they'll lash Their horses in a gallop through the street, That Mother Gape may ope her casement wide And Father Quidnunc stare. Take heed of this. Use all despatch, not as to boast great things Are staked upon thy speed, but so to join Despatch with privacy as the stake's on both. Deem that this trust is for the empire's weal And not to do thee credit. Fare thee well. [Exit Officer. He's a young envoy in a cause like this. Alexius has the gifts that quicken zeal In them that serve him, but he hardly knows What harness it should wear or whither speed. Scene IV. —An Apartment in a Convent near St. Conon's Shrine. Eudocia and Anna Comnena. Eudocia. I never knew but all of us were brave. In tears! I'll not believe you of our race. Anna. Oh! were I not I were not weeping now. Heaven knows it is not for myself. Eudocia. Why there! That were the least unreasonable cause. Is it my brother that you weep for? He Is nothing new to dangers nor to life. His thirty years on him have nigh told double, Being doubly laden with the unlightsome stuff That life is made of. I have often thought How Nature cheats this world in keeping count: Some men shall pass for old who never lived; These monks, to wit; they count the time, not spend it; They reckon moments by the tick of beads And ring the hours with psalmody—clocks, clocks; If one of these had gone a century I would not say he'd lived. My brother's age Hath spanned the matter of too many lives; He's full of years, though young: ne'er weep for him. Anna. He looks not tired of life. Eudocia. Not when with you. There is a sort of youth comes back on men By sight of childhood. It is so with him; At least by sight of you. Anna. But others, too, Call him a cheerful man. Eudocia. They know him not. You knew him not in earlier youth; and I Can scarce believe that it was he I knew. The false vivacity of fevered blood Under the press and spur of times like these Deceives not me; nor yet the power he hath Of holding off the burthen of his mind Till the time come that leaves him to himself. Disquieting thought hath wasted him within. Weep for Alexius, if weep you must; His seems a life worth saving; he is now Much what some ten years past his brother was, Yet may be what he is. Let Fate alone; There's many a man is best cut off betimes. Date not their destinies. Anna. You love them not, Though you're their sister, as their cousin loves them. Eudocia. I would not have them walk in the dusk like thieves, Nor crouch like chidden slaves, nor dig them holes And hide like Troglodytes. I'd have them live Even as their sires of old, linked each with each; Careless of kingdoms so they might live free; If not, I'd have them Kings. Anna. Alas! and I Would count it no mischance that sent us back To our Propontic island, where we all Were born and bred in peace, who now are strewn Like a wrecked convoy on a savage coast. Eudocia. Hush! Prophetess of woe; the ships sail well, Though they be deep in the water. Enter Comnenus. Here are we, Obedient to your summons; both in doubt, And one in dread, of what may be the cause. Why have you sent us hither? Comnenus. Need I say, Eudocia, that it never was my wont To clip and pare ill tidings for your ear. The city is no longer safe for you: Therefore I sent you hither. Anna. And yourself? Comnenus. My safety will be cared for in due course. Anna. And stay you with us, then? Eudocia. No! by my faith; That question I can answer. We seek here, If I misjudge not, the good neighbourhood Of Mother Church's sanctuary. Anna. And he? Eudocia. Think you the sanctuary's a place for him? Comnenus. I have a safer refuge. Mother Church Hath no such holy precinct that my blood Would not redeem all sin and sacrilege Of slaughter therewithin. But there's a spot Within the circle my good sword describes Which by God's grace is sanctified for me. Eudocia. Yet do not be so rash to walk the streets Without a guard. Anna. Are not the riots quelled? Comnenus. They are not: they increase and will increase Until the cause be quelled. Anna. What is the cause? Comnenus. There are, if truth were known, some three or four; But one is named. Eudocia. And what may be its name? Comnenus. Truly they call it by my name, Comnenus. Eudocia. Then they miscall it. Comnenus. No, not altogether. When things of evil aspect are to do The first cause is not named, but commonly Some slight, remote, co-operative cause, Whereto the people knit them soul and body Unknowing that which stirs them up to act, Which is the mover's cause, not multitude's. The mover finds them reasons, they him hands. Eudocia. Whence hath he then these reasons? Comnenus. Oh! they grow wild. He is an arrant bungler in his work, Whate'er it be, who is not stored with reasons. Reasons! there's nought in life so plentiful! They are the most besetting snares of men Who ought to act by instinct, did they but know How far their nature, when not tampered with, Their prostituted reason would transcend. Eudocia. But how are you the cause? Comnenus. The multitude Were ready for a cause—and there was I. There's much sedition in the gastric juice Gnawing the empty coats of poor men's stomachs. Eudocia. This tells me nothing: prithee to the point. Comnenus. What would you have? Eudocia. I'd have you signify What is our hope, what ought to be our aim, What's to be feared, what to be done . . . . Comnenus. Ay—true; I never knew a woman placed in peril But must be doing; if not dead despair, Then fever'd action:—Muse, Eudocia, Muse, meditate, and moralize like me. That which I crave of you is quietness. You would intrust me with your safety, Anna? Anna. Truly I would not trust you with your own, So I could find you a more careful guard; But as for mine I'd trust it with a foe. Comnenus. Where would you find one? Anna. Oh! it were easy, that; Foes are as plentiful as lukewarm friends. Eudocia. Why, Anna, can your tongue too play the censor! Comnenus. My cousin, may you ne'er have cause to prove The fervour of your friends.—Hark! there's the bell: Is it for vespers? Anna. It is evensong. Comnenus. And you attend it?—tell the Abbess then That I detain my sister—has she leave? Eudocia. Ay, say so, cousin. [Exit Anna. Comnenus. My time is short; but something must be told Which 'twere as well she heard not. Why it is I know not (for the thing must come to her As to all else in time), but I would not Disclose to her—no, not a thousandth part— The knowledge which to me, though loth to learn, My dealings with this treacherous world have taught. Eudocia. And what has happened now? Comnenus. A summons came From Theodora: I attended her, And found her ready to betray her father. Eudocia. She is more passionate than politic, Yet lacks not cunning: she has then despaired Of winning you by fairer means? Comnenus. And these Have failed her likewise: I refused her suit. Eudocia. But not her tidings? Comnenus. I refused them too. It went against my nature to accept them. I am prepared for whatsoe'er befalls, Or shall be on the morn. Provision's made Where it may be adventured here within. To-morrow night, so that his purpose hold, Alexius may be looked for. You, from hence, Can, at a word of warning, reach the shrine; There wait in safety the result: if ill, To you, Eudocia, I need not say How ruin should be met. Eudocia. If it be well, Then no instructor will my brother need How he should wear the diadem. Comnenus. Enough. That's as it may fall out. My brows, in sooth, Would rather bare them to the breath of heaven Than be so gold-encircled: yet 'tis true, I shall need no instructor. It grows late. I think I have said all. Farewell, farewell. Should it be long ere we two meet again, Yet is it not for us to chide the Fates, Or make long partings. Eudocia. One word more, but one;— Last night I heard strange stories of a feast To which you bade your friends: it is not true? Comnenus. It makes for me that it should pass for true. 'Twas a Damoclean feast and we sat down In flowing robes with corslets underneath; And I may say I ne'er saw graver guests Met to carouse, save at the royal board, Where memory evocates imperial deeds Such as betrayed Britannicus of old. Another such has waited me too long. Be strong of heart—be like yourself.—Farewell. [Exit. Eudocia. And I could say to you “Be strong of heart,” But that were needless; and “Be like yourself” Were an injunction I would qualify. ACT II. Scene I. —The Palace of the Cæsars. Nicephorus. Priests are even all but Kings, and would be Kings But that the diadem disdains bald crowns. That snake engendered amid Rome's green ruins, The inheritor of Satan's pomp and pride, At whose fierce hiss the royal Henry shook An Emperor excommunicate, and bowed His haughty spirit, after three days' fast, To walk barefooted to Canusio's gates Most abject in submission—that proud priest Is imitated here: but I can spurn Their interdicts, and call my crown my own, Seeing their schism doth comminute their power. Is no one there? What, Corius! Lazer! Ho! Enter Attendant. Comes not our reverend Lord the Patriarch yet? Attendant. Not yet, my Liege. Nicephorus. Ha! what hast got beneath thine upper vest? Here, here; 'tis steel! Attendant. The star you bade me wear. Nicephorus. Ay, true—the star—thou hast deserved it well. The Patriarch, as I think, is past his hour; The moon should rise at eight and we should see her But that the horizon's cloudy; yon's her light; What says the Persian water-clock? How now! There's dust upon thy sandals! where hast been? Attendant. You sent me for my Lord the Patriarch, Sire. Nicephorus. Ay, true, 'twas thou; a trusty knave thou art. What's doing in the streets? Attendant. Sire, here and there The people gather and invoke the death Of Count Comnenus and reproach his house For all the ills they suffer. Nicephorus. Why, so let them. What, saw'st thou nought of the other faction, ha? Attendant. My Liege, there's none can see them; they're so few And cowardly they dare not venture forth. Nicephorus. Well: let me know the hour. [Exit Attendant. They may be few, But whether cowardly demands a doubt. There never was a kingdom but comprised Some thousands of bold men that hate the King, Whom in some kingdoms there are none to love; And of these thousands one life sacrificed In killing of this King would quench the hate, The smouldering hate that burns these bosoms black. Now, it is strange that men hang, burn, and drown For love, religion, pride, I know not what,— Cast away life for very wantonness,— Yet of these thousands you shall not find one Will dare an instant death and slay the King. And through the lack of this one instrument Innocuous malice lies a coiled-up snake Through life till toothless age. What threatens me Is not a general hatred; 'tis the growth Which year by year a lengthened puissance breeds Of checked ambition and exasperate will; For who reigns long must needs wear out the hopes And baulk the aims of many. Yet are these By prosperous suitors shackled . . . Enter Attendant. Attendant. Please my Liege, The Patriarch has arrived. Nicephorus. At last. Admit him. And some are yet more hated than they hate; Careless withal, incautious, eating, drinking, Sporting and sleeping like a Goth or Frank After a victory. Then why this fear? Here is the Church too, glad to change with me And hug my burthen. Be it so! Amen! For Kings should never seem to be men's foes, There being always some to take that part Whose malice, seeming to be bridled in, Is spurred the while and chafes with neck high-arched, Till, once let go, it gallops to its goal, And hath the scandal for its guerdon fair. Thus with this headstrong priest, in extreme age Fiercer and fierier— Enter Patriarch. Most reverend Lord, We give you hearty welcome. Patriarch. May the host Of heaven in all good thoughts preserve the King! Nicephorus. I sent for you through pressure of some ills That weigh but heavily on ourself and state. How is't, my Lord, that in our sovereign seat We cannot rest in peace for slaves and monks Careering through the streets from morn till night? Patriarch. How is it, say you, Sire? Why thus it is, Yea, thus it is; the sovereign arm is weak, The sovereign heart is palsied, and the Church, Reft of her strength thereby, is trampled down. How is it? look abroad—Time, crippled sore, Hath lost his footing and slid back three ages. Behold! the spirit of Isaurian Leo, Accursed heresiarch! is forth and fighting. Nicephorus. Ay, ay, my Lord, since first she found a voice In Paul of Tarsus, still the Church hath cried That heresies are growing; yet she thrives From age to age, till crowns but hang on crosiers. Patriarch. Yea, doth she thrive? and from her very walls The images of her most glorious saints Down shivered into shards; her ministers By every uncommunicating slave Laughed unto scorn! yea, thriving call you this? Then take thou heed, for by the bones of Basil The Empire and the Church shall thrive alike. Nicephorus. Be temperate, priest. Patriarch. I tell thee, monarch, when the crosier bends, The sceptre breaks; and I will tell thee more; 'Twere better for thy temples to have worn The iron crown in Lombardy, than here Thy golden diadem and tarnished thus. Nicephorus. What wouldst thou have? Truly 'tis aid I need, Not admonition. Seek I not an end To all these troubles, or did I begin them? Or can I with a heartier will consult For compassing their cure? Patriarch. Tis well, my Liege; The Church shall aid with her maternal arm, Propping her aged servant at his task. I am gone in years, my Liege, am very old, Coreless and sapless, weak, and needs must crave Support of secular force, else had this sore Not grown upon us thus. It is not well When that the Church and State divide their power And carp upon the difference. In my youth I can remember, old as I may be, I sojourned at the convent of St. Anne In the Hercynian forest; and one night There was a storm abroad, and forth I went Along with it, and roaming through the wood I saw an aged oak which groaned and creaked And flung its arms aloft, whereof the nearest Ground each into the other till both fell Sawn thorough sheer; and this I likened then To Nebuchadnezzar's tree of monarchy— But I am wandering; 'tis mine age's weakness. Nicephorus. I grant you, holy father, that for us To be at strife, is but for each to waste The strength that each hath need of. But the Church, The Church it is Count Isaac hath assailed, And if her champions strike not, how should I? Patriarch. Speak but the word, the blow shall follow fast. I will abet your majesty in all, So it be sudden. Whatsoe'er is feared In states is dangerous. The man is bold, His friends are many, and it were not safe That warning went before. Nicephorus. Yes, more than bold. There is in him a carelessness of life Which ofttimes betters care. Patriarch. In him I grant; Not in his friends and followers. All they have Of courage falters seeing him removed. Nicephorus. Removed—removed; but how? Patriarch. With gracious speed And godly prudence; swift and therefore sure. Let but a whisper of a threat be heard And you shall see him desperate and his friends By very fear compacted and compelled To follow where his frenzied boldness bids. Who then shall answer for the issue? Nicephorus. Well What wouldst thou counsel—exile? interdict? Patriarch. Commit him to the power of Mother Church; Call we a Synod, cite we the Count forthwith To answer for his sacrilege. Nicephorus. What! now? Patriarch. Now, now, I say; the time is fitting; thus Surprise shall bar resistance or escape. The measure of his wickedness filled full We take him in the surfeit of his sins— The deadly surfeit and the doom. Nicephorus. So, so; 'Tis sudden, but I hardly may deny That ofttimes what is sudden is more safe Than what is slow. Thy counsel shall be mine, And may God speed it! Patriarch. That He surely shall. Despatch a guard; arrest the Count; meanwhile A Synod shall be summoned. Nicephorus. And the award? What dost thou purpose? Patriarch. That is for the Church Assembled to adjudge: the sinner thou Deliverest to her hands; the rest is hers; And she will purge her sanctuary. Nicephorus. 'Tis just. Yet bear in mind that nothing has been proved Of treasonable sort, and lacking proof, I burthen not my conscience with his blood; Nor of his following, till their guilt be clear, Would I take life too hastily. Patriarch. My Liege, Know you not there are maladies in men Which in their rise were easy to be cured Were they but known; whereof when clear become The diagnostics, difficult is the cure. For treason timely treatment: be content: This is an issue that concerns the Church, Which sleeps not and will take her torch in hand. Nicephorus. Order it so. My crown these last few years Hath pressed some furrows in my brow which else Time had been tardier with. It lightens me To have a friend like thee, in whom I trust. Patriarch. God have your majesty in His safe keeping! An hour will bring us hither. Nicephorus. In an hour The culprit shall attend you! God be with thee! Scene II. —The Palace of the Comneni. The board spread as for a feast. Macrinus, Numerian, and others. Leaders and Soldiers of the faction dressed as revellers, musicians, attendants, etc. Arms appear occasionally underneath the dresses. Enter Comnenus. Comnenus. What! friends, the board is spread, and ye abide The coming of the host? Much grieved is he His noble guests should wait. But how is this? Rich smell the viands; whence these grave regards? Macrinus. My Lord, we have not all the art, like you, To cast aside perplexities and cares: But though our looks be grave, our hearts are staunch. Comnenus. Well, then we'll all be grave. Be seated, friends: But pledge me first in this; 'tis Samian wine, And of the innermost; it quickens counsel, And makes it bolder, which with us is better. Your toast, Sir; you are practised much in toasts. Numerian. I am, Sir, and in things of more concern. “The double dyeing of the royal purple.” Comnenus. I pledge not that: we're drinking wine, not blood. Success to us: say nothing of the rest. [They drink. My Lord Macrinus—to the head of the board; I shall be but a listener. Macrinus. Sir, I thank you; But there are worthier of that place than I. Comnenus. None, none, Macrinus, that I know of, none; And if there be they'll pardon me the choice. Sit close about the board and speak not loud. [They sit. When we brake off last night, Sirs, I remember We had some difference as to modes and times. You said, Sir, as I think— 1st Leader. My Lord, my thought Was humbly this; that could we seize some post Within the walls, 'twould profit more our cause; Since flight doth alway with the vulgar sort Give token of defeat or loss, and thence Their spirits swell with triumph. 2nd Leader. But, my Lord, In my mind it were good they do thus swell; For as despair may oft avert men's ruin, So causeless exultation brings it on; The one emboldening reason, the other folly. 3rd Leader. Besides, supposing we could win this post, 'Twould make the times of action cross; for look,— Wait we your brother's coming, we're too late; The news is theirs as soon as ours; not wait, And should he be delayed, we're premature; For you'll observe, my Lord . . . Comnenus. Enough, enough; I see your point, Sir, and I hold it good. 1st Leader. Yet, Sir, there are some reasons we o'er-look . . . Comnenus. There are, Sir, many; which I overpass, Not wholly overlook; for should I stop To weigh the grains of reason one by one We are to gather and glance o'er, good Sir, 'Twould hold us here till morning; not to add, That so we multiply the chance of error. We'll hold this matter, with your leave, arranged. 1st Leader. My Lord, you would not pass Numerian's toast, Yet would I deem it over-lenity To spare another's blood and stake our own. One death or ere the strife began, my Lord, Might save some thousands. Comnenus. But not salve the sin. My friends, God knows too lenient am I not, And to my nature 'tis less opposite To be the cause whereby a thousand bleed Than purposely kill one to save the rest; And there is reason for it, howe'er we gloze. This once for all, him hold I a false friend, (Which signifies I hold him worse than foe,) Who strikes at any life save in fair fight. Enter Attendant. Attendant. Sir, there's one waiting at the gate to see you. Comnenus. One—what one, who? Attendant. I know not, Sir; he's muffled in his cloak, In fashion more a Latin than a Greek. Comnenus. My friends, await me there within. Macrinus. You're armed? Comnenus. From head to foot. [They withdraw. Enter Theodora. Comnenus. When I shall know my guest to be a friend, I'll give him welcome. Theodora. You may give it then. [Discovering herself. You might have known her for a friend long since, She proffers you but one proof more. [Giving her hand. Comnenus. A fair one. Theodora. You well may wonder, and I think you do, Although you show it not. Comnenus. Not much; not much; Ten years are gone since I have felt surprise Save at my own existence and the stars. Theodora. If not surprise, what else then can you feel? Oh Count, I ask it not in bitterness, But can you see me here, almost, I own, A supplicant—me, me a supplicant— A woman and a princess at thy feet Beseeching thee— Comnenus. Oh, say no more—stop there. Theodora. Beseeching thee to save thyself and me, And feel nor pity, gratitude, nor love? Thy life thou scarce canst deem so little worth As I do mine; but it is worse than death To bear a dead heart in a living body; And when I tell thee death is at thy door, The doom pronounced, the warrant out, the axe Already in the headsman's hand, I say Not only fly from death, but waken life In thy dead heart. Be but a living man And we will fly together. Comnenus. Princess, no— It cannot be; but yet misjudge me not; I am not reckless, as you think, of life; I am not thankless, as you think, for love: Your countrymen, the Thracians, held of old Their counsels o'er their cups in night carouse, Perpending them next morn: even such has been My session of to-night. My head, I think, Will keep the headsman waiting. For my heart, It is a sad and solitary heart,— So sad that it must needs be solitary,— And though not dead, disordered unto death, And though not thankless, pitiless, or proud, Yet inaccessible to love. Theodora. Then, Count, Know that I hold thy head from this time forth As worthless as thy heart—and weak and fond And tender as I would have been and was, Or e'er these drops are dried upon my cheek I'll see it rolling bloodily in the dust With triumph and with joy. Till then, farewell. Comnenus. It is but in thy passion and thy heat Thou speak'st so wilderedly. Enter Attendants. 1st Attendant. My Lord— 2nd Attendant. My Lord— Comnenus. Soft! see you not this lady? One at once. 1st Attendant. Sir, the Varangian guard is at the gate, With two officials of the Church. Comnenus. What say they? 1st Attendant. They claim admittance on a royal writ, Citing you to attend a Synod. Comnenus. Good. Admit them. 1st Attendant. What! the Churchmen, Sir? Comnenus. Ay, all; Open the gates; let all who will come in. Thou staring idiot, do my bidding; go. [Exit First Attendant. Here, Porgius—thy wit runs deeper—hark! When all are in, look that the gates be shut. [Exit Second Attendant. And, Macer, call Macrinus hither. See! [Exit Third Attendant. Your warning, Lady, would have come but late. Enter Macrinus. Comnenus (meeting and speaking aside to him). Macrinus, we have talked enough. Thou seest The wordy time is past. Macrinus. Indeed, my Lord, This end was little looked for. Comnenus. Not the less I bid it welcome. They but give their hands To fashion our devices. As they will. Make speed, Macrinus, to the southern gate With but such numbers as may make it sure Yet not alarm the town; close by it stands The cloister of St. Conon; send some friend To bid my sister and my cousin there Hie them to sanctuary. Within an hour, If all be well, I mean to pass the gate. That will not press you? Macrinus Ample time, my Lord. Comnenus. Send Hertius round to draw our scattered friends To the same spot,—within the hour. Till then I will amuse the Emperor and his court. Macrinus. But for these guards? Comnenus. Hark! now they pass the gates. When all are in, disarm and bind them. Yes, They shall along with me, by their good leave. [Exit Macrinus. Your father's action, Princess, with a bound O'ertakes our tardy talk. Theodora. So sudden! oh, So madly sudden! Count, there still is time— Say you recall the past—say you repent,— And I may yet find means— Comnenus. Nor now nor ever Will I make bargains for a lady's love. Enter Two Apparitors. What is your errand, Sirs?—say on; no form. 1st Apparitor. Lord Count, our errand is to take thee hence By virtue of this power. Comnenus. Nay, keep the scroll; Your tone's so lofty you must needs have powers. But should I ask indulgence for an hour To be prepared? 2nd Apparitor. My Lord, it cannot be. The conclave waits. Comnenus. Ay, doth it? then I come. I pray you first to pledge me in this wine: 'Tis juice might soften Churchmen. 1st Apparitor. No, my Lord: Our orders are to bear with no delay. Comnenus. To bear with none! [A disturbance without. Oh! be at ease, Sirs: hark! 'Tis but disputes between my guards and yours Which shall become my escort to the court. Enter Attendant. Attendant. My Lord, your orders are obeyed. Comnenus. 'Tis well. Confine these Churchmen in the cells below. 1st Apparitor. My Lord, beware how you maltreat the Church. Comnenus. We leave them there, and on our march be sure No voice be heard nor any leave their ranks. 1st Apparitor. I say, the thunders of the Church shall peal Against this outrage— 2nd Apparitor. Hush! it will but goad him; 'Tis plain he's master. Comnenus. Order thus the march: The royal guard within, unarmed and bound, My own surrounding them, myself will lead,— This lady with me. Now, Sirs, we must part. [To the Apparitors. Keep your own secret: it is safe with me. [To Theodora. 1st Apparitor. Lord Count— Comnenus. Nay, on, Sirs; you will suffer nought Save mild restraint till morning. 2nd Apparitor. God be praised! Comnenus (to Theodora). Give me your hand. Not so? then walk by me, And doubt not my protection. You came here In no such friendly guidance. There—[As they go out]—just so. All as I wished, Macrinus: fling the gates wide, And sound the trumpets of the Royal Guard. Out, out, friends, out. Scene III. —A Hall in the Palace, where many Ecclesiastics are assembled in Synod. The Emperor is seated on a throne at the further end of a table, at which are also seated the Patriarch, the Bishop of Trebizond, the Bishop of Nicomedia, the Synodal Secretary, and other Dignitaries. In front the Bishops of Heraclea and Philippopolis are conversing in an undertone and are joined by the Bishop of Cæsarea. Bishop of Heraclea. Methinks the time is long. Bishop of Philippopolis. It passeth heavily, and truly 'tis heavy laden. Bishop of Cœsarea. I heard our brother of Trebizond whispering the Patriarch of an idle rumour that the heretics were found watching and had overpowered the Royal Guard. Bishop of Heraclea. At such times there are ever such rumours. Bishop of Cœsarea. Hark!—no; 'tis nothing. Is not the Emperor paler than his wont? Bishop of Heraclea. He is as white as an almond tree in June. Bishop of Cæsarea. And our brother of Trebizond? Bishop of Heraclea. There's no more blood in his face than in this crucifix. Patriarch. What is your talk, my Lords? Speak out, speak out: there be no laics here. Speak freely out. Bishop of Cæsarea. Do thou make answer. Bishop of Heraclea. Most holy father, we spake how that this heretic hath tarried long. Patriarch. He cometh late to judgment; yea, too late. Long-suffering are the delegates of heaven; Abounding they in mercy and in grace: So judgment followeth sin with stealing steps. Too late—too late. Emperor (to one of the Ecclesiastics). Send some one forth to look if they be coming. [Exit Ecclesiastic. Patriarch. I say we're all too late. Hast written out the award? The Secretary. Holiest father, it is here. Patriarch. We'll have it signed at once. First to his Majesty, and then the rest. Emperor. Not me, not me; the thing concerns not me. Patriarch. Well, well, here's warranty enough without. [Signs. So—pass it to my Lord of Trebizond. Bishop of Trebizond. Must I sign first? Patriarch. At once, my Lord, and pass it. Bishop of Heraclea (aside to the Bishop of Cæsarea). Mark you how the style trembles in his hand. The Secretary. My Lord, you're writing on the written part: The space is here. Bishop of Trebizond. My eyesight fails me: here,—I see, I see. Enter an Attendant. Emperor. Thine errand? We waive the adorations, speak thine errand. Attendant. The Royal Guard is entering the gates. Emperor. 'Tis well, right well. Let them bring up the prisoner. Patriarch. Bring him up. Most reverend Lords, we pray you take your seats. Enter another Attendant in haste. Attendant. 'Tis not the Royal Guard; 'tis the Comnenians: they have passed the gates, Count Isaac at their head. Emperor. Great God! then all is lost! Where is the Cæsarissa? Bishop of Trebizond. We shall be murdered all! Bishop of Cæsarea. We're martyrs doomed. Bishop of Heraclea. Yea, verily the hour is come, and we are called and chosen. [During these exclamations the Hall has filled with Officers of State and Attendants crowding in confusedly. Patriarch. Silence, my Lords, what craven cries be these? Your Majesty will please send some one forth To draw your forces from the suburbs round. I tell you take your seats. Ho! God is great! His Church is mighty, and that might have we. I say, bring up the Count. Several voices. He's coming up. Patriarch. I say, then, let him come. Enter Comnenus, who walks to the foot of the table, the crowd falling back on either side. Comnenus. I'm here to answer to your summons. Patriarch. Lo! Almighty God is present in His Church! His Church is present here! How hast thou dared then to profane this presence By coming here in arms? Give up thy sword. [Comnenus ungirds his sword and flings it on the table. Comnenus. (after some pause). What would ye have with it that cannot use it? My Lords, you trifle with me; here am I Brought by your midnight summons from my house, And ye have nought to say. Ye do but mock me. Patriarch. We mock thee not: 'tis thou that mock'st high Heaven. Thou'rt summoned here on many an ugly count Of sacrilege and heresy and schism, Which so thou answer'st not and clear'st thy fame, We shall, in due acquittance of our trust, Pronounce the interdict from fire and water And cut thee off from Christian fellowship. Comnenus. My Lords, or e'er ye shall inhibit me, From fire and water, have it you in charge I cut not off yourselves from earth and air. My Lords, this world is not so all your own That ye can grant away the elements Amongst your friends, and lock one moiety up From them that like you not. Ye kneel and pray That God will make you humble as the dust, Then, rising, arrogate omnipotence And shake the ashes from your shaven crowns. But I ere long will teach you how to stoop In veriest lowliness and know yourselves. Patriarch (holds up the cross and pronounces the adjuration, “Ecce crucem Domini! fugite partes adversæ!”) A man possessed—'tis Sathan speaks, not he! The father of lies hath spoken by his mouth. An exorcist for this demoniac straight To disenchant his body of the fiend! Avaunt! avaunt! Comnenus. Ay, echo cries “Avaunt!” Ye charge your own malignancy on me. A demonocracy of unclean spirits Hath governed long these Synods of your Church, The Antichrist foretold: and I am he Who, in the fulness of the approaching time, Will exorcise you all. Expect my coming. [Exit. [A short silence ensues, during which several persons who had followed Comnenus re-enter, exclaiming, “The Count is gone!” Patriarch. Thy wrath go with him, God! Emperor. I hear the sound of horses' feet afar; The city force is out—he cannot stay; He will abscond and seek support abroad. Let every tribune hie him to his charge. The prefects and the eparchs will resort To the Bucoleon with what speed they may, And there I'll meet them. Each man to his charge. Patriarch (to the Bishops). Soldiers of God and militants supern! Fight the good fight! on us devolves the charge To fulminate the judgments of the Church; And on the morn, before Sophia's shrine, Shall this high charge be solemnly fulfilled. Let every Churchman now assembled here Attend and share the office.—You may go. Scene IV. —Precincts of the Palace.—A Eunuch of the Imperial Household and an Exorcist. Exorcist. He is gone, then? Eunuch. Gone! he galloped out of the town as if he had ten thousand Devils in him. Exorcist. Well, I am glad he is gone before I came, for to say the truth he is ill to deal with. Eunuch. But thou couldst exorcise him? Exorcist. Oh! if we come to the matter of science, an evil spirit is no more in one man than in another. Eunuch. But tell me, I beseech thee, which saint is the most powerful for freeing the demoniacs? Exorcist. That is, look you, according as they are obsessed or possessed; and also according to the order of the spirit: now for the abruption of evil spirits of Belphegor's or the ninth order, St. George of Cappadocia is your only saint. I have known him bring the Devil clean out of a man's body before ever he knew him to have been there. Eunuch. Ay, indeed! Exorcist. Yes; and you may remember Anthemius the Eparch, who was possessed of Leviathan and caused a dropsy in the Emperor's daughter. I never had a more obstinate spirit to deal with in all my experience. Eunuch. But you succeeded? Exorcist. I bless God, by the help of St. George, to say nothing of my own secret receipt for suffumigation, I brought him fairly out at last, and her Highness was cured. Eunuch. But did she not relapse in the space of a year or so. Exorcist. Relapse? Yes, she did relapse; for, look you, there's nothing sneaks back into a man's body so soon as your villanous evil spirit. Eunuch. But Anthemius has not troubled you lately? Exorcist. No; the Emperor sent him to the prisons of Lethe on the other side of the water, and the word went he was strangled. Eunuch. So he was, for certain. Exorcist. What was it for, then? Eunuch. Some idle tongues spake how that all was not as it should be between him and the Princess; but what plainly appeared against him was, that he stole the hood of a Benedictine Friar from his cell after eleven o'clock at night, and being afterwards at the Sabbath of evil spirits and magicians, did there put it upon Satan's head, saying, “hoc honore dignus es,” in contempt of St. Benedict and his holy order. Exorcist. God's mercy! it was time he was put out of the way! what will not a man do when once he is maleficated. Eunuch. Ay; and who could bring him round without your help?—Come, we are friends, tell us some of the secrets of your craft. Exorcist. There be things whereon we discourse to our friends, and there be things where on we hold our peace. Eunuch. Nay but— Exorcist. Mark me. There is an inside and an outside to everything. There is a virtue in silence, and that virtue is discretion, which is the virtue that holds a man back from babbling. Again—he that saith nothing doth wisely, for what he knows is more than you know. Eunuch. By St. Peter that is true, and I will seek no further. Exorcist. Nevertheless, as it is thou that hast inquired of me touching this matter, I will say somewhat; for the man that has nothing to say to his friend is too wise for this world. Eunuch. Thou art a true friend to say so. Exorcist. Attend then: when the demoniac is brought before you, the first thing is to make sure that he is bonâ fide possessed: for which end you shall look for the Devil's mark in the form of a hare's foot; and when you find it, run a lancet half an inch into the flesh; if the man cries out, it is a mere certainty he is possessed. The next thing is to bless the instruments, which are four; that is, water, incense, salt, and oil. Water is twofold; that is, first, water of ablution, and second, water of aspersion. Water of ablution is sevenfold; that is, first— Eunuch. But tell us the manner of it. Exorcist. The manners of it are three; there is the præexorcization, the exorcization, and the postexorcization. The præexorcizations are fifteen; that is— Eunuch. Nay, I see it is past my understanding. But only tell me this,—how do you get the Devil out of a woman? Exorcist. You've gravelled me there; if once the Devil gets into a woman— Eunuch. But you told me but now, speaking of her Highness— Exorcist. Why look you, the Devils that have to do with women are two,—the Incubi and Succubi; now for the Incubi— [Trumpets without. Eunuch. Hark! the troops are gathering; that is the Imperial march; they are coming this way: we must be gone. Exorcist. I fear some bloodshed will come of this. Eunuch. I care not what comes of it; nothing new to this city, we may be sure. Exorcist. No, unless it were peace and quietness, which I much mistrust. Farewell; shame the Devil and renounce his works, and thou wilt never have need of my craft. Eunuch. Easier to keep him out than to cast him out,if I know anything of it. Farewell. ACT III. Scene I. —The European Shore of the Propontic. —Isaac and Alexius Comnenus. Alexius. But for that hair that's twisted in the grain I had not known thee. Comnenus. Youth, Alexius, Knows nought of changes; age has traced them oft, Expects, and can expound them. You yourself Are somewhat altered, but the few years more Of time which I have travelled through have taught The art to know what has been from what is, What's like to be from both: change is youth's wonder: Such transmutations have I seen in men That fortune seemed a slow and steadfast power Compared with nature. Alexius. There is nought you've seen More altered than yourself. I speak not of an outward change alone; For you are changed in heart. Comnenus. Ay, hearts change too: Mine has grown sprightly, has it not, and hard? I ride it now with spurs; else, else, Alexius— Well, many a sage has said the best of life Is childhood, and I sagely say the same. Life is a banquet where the best's first served, And when the guest is cloyed comes oil and garlic. Alexius. Childhood! But later years went well, and gifts Came with them that were better worth than joys. Have you forgotten how it was your wont To muse the hours away along this shore— These very rippled sands? Comnenus. The sands are here, But not the footprints. Would you trace them now? A thousand tides and storms have dashed them out; Winds brushed them and waves worn them; and o'er all The heavy foot of Time, who plods the shore Replenishing his sand-glass, trodden down Their vestiges and mine. Look, here's a rock— His seat or e'er he pushed it from the cliff, And which shall now be ours; a goodly seat; He's worn it smooth—smooth as the fair round cheek He lies in wait for, nor has touched with care Nor stained with tears, nor even tutored yet To dimple into lies. Alexius. Look! what is here,— Here, carved upon the rock? Comnenus. That know not I, But Time has ta'en it for a poet's scrawl— He's razed it. Alexius. No, not wholly; look again; I take it for a lover's. Comnenus. What! there's some talk Of balmy breath, and hearts pierced through and through With eyes' miraculous brightness, vows ne'er broken Until the Church had sealed them, charms loved madly Until it be a sin to love them not, And kisses ever sweet till innocent. How much that should be written in the stream Has our fond lover written in the rock, Not knowing of its nature? Alexius. Hardly much; Two words there are,—no more. Comnenus. And what are they? Alexius. “Alas, Irene!”—Why, your looks are now Such as I once beheld them heretofore; 'Twas when our mother died;—what troubles you? Comnenus. Now this I hate, to stand and be deciphered, Pored on industriously and puzzled through Like riddles that are read o'winter's nights When maids and boys have nought to prate on else. Alexius, forgive me. Leave me now. There's business waiting for us both. Alexius. Oh no; I cannot leave you yet; there's yet to tell A seven years' history since last we met. Comnenus. Go put it down in four and twenty books 'Cleped “the Comneniad,”—to be read at leisure. We'll have no more of this; my youth is past And I would not recall it. Alexius. Isaac, oh! Can you stand here and say so? Can you look On this soft-rolling, deep-embayed sea, With yon blue beautiful ridge half-compassed round,— Hear the low plash of wave o'erwhelming wave, The loving lullaby of your mother Ocean, (We, like the Cretan, are not sons of Earth,)— See the rocks stand like nature's ruins round, For man's were never so majestical— The boundary forts of Earth and Ocean's empire, The deep-scarred veterans of their countless wars, Your native and your father's native shores— Can you be so surrounded and speak thus! Are they not lovely? Comnenus. It is not the eye To which these things seem lovely, but the mind, Which makes, unmakes, remodels, or rejects. When I was in the country whence you come, I oft would watch the sun go down; and there He sets with such refulgency of red, That the whole east, with the reflected glow, Is crimsoned as it may be here at dawn: I would the life of man did so decline, But that still darkens to the cloudy close. Alexius. There is an after-dawn. Comnenus. That way I look, Or I have used to look, and that way turned I turned my back upon the past. With you It faces me again. Alexius. We'll let it rest. How is our cousin Anna? Comnenus. Well, quite well: The natural infirmities of youth, Sadness and softness, hopefulness, wishfulness, All pangs for which we do not see good cause Let's take no count of. If at ninety years A man shall die, accusing no disease, Only by reason of the ninety years, So shall a maiden languish at nineteen Only by reason of the time and state. Enough for nature if she keep us sound In the slow tide and tenor of our lives, Betwixt youth's flushings and the lapse of age. Alexius. A rumour went our gentle cousin's charms Were to have filled for you this gap of life. If she grew up with what I call to mind Of gifts that graced her childhood, few like her! Comnenus. I own it, but I own it unenslaved. I scarcely care for beauty. Alexius. Have you nought But that to care for? May we not say love? Comnenus. That is a point to which most men would speak In words of dubious import, to imply That they are loved, but very loth to tell it. I answer, Yes, she loves me. Alexius. And you her? Comnenus. Ay;—with a difference, though: her love's untold, Though I am not so young in the world to doubt it; I tell her that I love her every day. I have designed her for a happier fate, And she shall learn to love herself, not me; Soon taught, soon taught. Alexius. And wherefore not love both? Comnenus. Because she never can be true to both. Hast no talk meeter for a battle's eve? Alexius. All is arranged; there's nought upon my mind. Comnenus. Nor need there be; but there is much on mine,— A weight of foregone years crowding along That seem pressed back by some approaching close: We'll talk of times to come to-morrow night. What time the watch is set I take me hence: I sleep beside Blachernæ. Alexius. Do you so? Is't not too near the walls? Comnenus. I go alone. One man at dusk will scarce be seen. Alexius. Alone? And take you not a guard then? Comnenus. Not so far. I have a watchful eye to yon monks' kennel; For, as I said, if aught be stirring there I'll seize upon the post by break of day. Alexius. You fear not for our sister? Comnenus. But thus far: I think when Pagans such as we make war, The safeguard of the Church is not so good But that my own is better. Alexius. Like enough. My way is with you half the distance. Comnenus. Well. Macrinus then shall lead; we'll play the spy. Let's to his tent; there must be orders given; My armour too is there; ere all is done Dusk will be well-nigh here and we'll set forth. Scene II. —Evening.—An outpost of the camp. Tents in the distance. Fires at intervals, reaching to the shore and throwing light across the Propontic. Soldiers lying on their arms. In front a Sentinel walking his rounds. Sentinel. So, so! There is like to be wild work tomorrow, and as to what is to happen to me, it may be known or it may not. It was scarcely right and just a little venturesome of my wife, to betake herself to the old wizard. Ah! after to-morrow never to walk more but with a wooden leg. Why, what then? My threescore and ten in this world is well-nigh out, and Father Jerome says a man may stump about in heaven with a wooden leg as stoutly as with the best. Enter Alexius. Alexius. Thou art one of Count Isaac's men, art not? Sentinel. How dost thou know that? Methinks by thy sunburnt face thou shouldst belong to my Lord Alexius. Alexius. True, I am from the east; but we are comrades for all that. Sentinel. Yes; for we are all Count Isaac's men now, mind'st thou. Alexius. True. Sentinel. Count Alexius is now no more than second in command. Alexius. No more. Sentinel. And in so small an army that is next to nothing. Alexius. 'Tis little, but as much as he deserves. Sentinel. Nay, I did not mean that: only I would have thee understand that thy master serves my master. Alexius. He does. There are few men worthy to serve thy master. I would that Count Alexius were. Sentinel. Not that I mean any ill of Count Alexius; he's young. Alexius. Ay, but one might be wiser, even at his years. Sentinel. Nay, I know not that. When I was two and twenty I know not if I had much more sense than he has now. 'Tis a miracle how sense will grow upon a man after he has mounted guard a few years. Thou wouldst not believe how many thoughts come and go in a wise man's head as he walks his four hours backwards and forwards upon an outpost. Alexius. How long hast thou been walking here? Sentinel. The matter of an hour. Alexius. And what thoughts have come and gone in thy head? Sentinel. The matter of four. Alexius. What was thy first thought? Sentinel. I bethought me that the wind was easterly and one ought to hear the waves break upon the Symplegades. Alexius. What was thy second thought? Sentinel. I thought when the moon rose I should see the tops of the fig-trees at Galatá; that's my birth-place. Alexius. And thy third? Sentinel. I thought if I was to fall to-morrow, I could like it were thereabouts. Alexius. Thy fourth? Sentinel. I thought when Count Isaac was Emperor, he would be for recasting the army, and I should tell him I was getting old in the service and could like to be one of the Immortals. Alexius. That I'll be bound for him thou shalt. Sentinel. How canst thou tell? Alexius. I know he takes care of those that stick to their old generals and look cold on the new. Sentinel. How know'st thou that? Thou art of the eastern forces. Alexius. None knows thy master better. Enter an Officer. Officer. My Lord, your brother waits you hard by where the roads meet. Alexius. I come. Farewell to thee. See thou keep a keen look-out to the north and west; the moon will soon be up, and on the scout side of the field; all thou need'st take heed of comes between thee and the light. Farewell. I'll tell Count Isaac thy deserts. [Exeunt Alexius and Officer. Sentinel. Holy Mother of God! that will be the young Count himself. 'Tis well he takes it no worse; for, to say the truth, I did him but scant justice. What was it I said to him? No doubt but I told him plain out every thought that has come into my head for this year and more. Scene III. —A Churchyard.—Comnenus, Alexius, and Guide. Comnenus. This road is but uneven. How is this? Guide. It is the burial-ground, my Lord; these hills are graves. Comnenus. Then do we trespass; but the dead ne'er heed us. Ha! Pray you, trip not up my heels, good friends, That lie in wait so stilly. Guide. Hush, my Lord. Comnenus. I tell thee that they heed us not. Guide. Our feet They heed not and they hear not; but some tell How a light word's recorded till the day When they shall burst their graves. Comnenus. And so it is; Words though from earth with wings they fly away Yet perish not nor lose themselves in space, But bend their course towards eternity, And roost beneath the judgment-seat of God. What may yon shape be, hewn upon the tomb? Guide. A cherub 'tis, my Lord. Comnenus. What, with that damnable visage? Guide. It is thus, my Lord, they carve them. Comnenus. 'Tis wondrous hideous. When I die, Alexius, I'll have an image of another mould Shall smile a cherub's blessing o'er my dust. What, ha! again—that rogue, The bungling sexton, overplied his task And buried us the epitaph; this stone Hath but one knob above ground, which obtrudes “Siste Viator” to who journey darkling. Well, there's a lesson when the tablet's buried More than its scroll could read us. Sit we here. This stone is new: there's but one name inscribed, And a long blank for chronicling the friends Whose hour comes after. Why not write their names? Then were the date but wanting. Look again— “Here lieth” (say rather “here once lay”) “The body of Peter Andros, a true spouse “And tender father—may the dust lie light . . .” Why, look you there! the relict of this Peter (Whom I once knew) and his all-duteous sons Drave Peter hitherward ere they bore him here; And here they stood around the low-laid sire, Echoing the hollow rattle of the mould Upon his coffin-lid with hollow groans; And then they wrote his epitaph,—a true one, Which yet they lied in writing. Could we call up The rings of mourners that have girt these mounds And bid them show their faces, 'twere a sight That to behold the Devil should jump for joy. But they have followed.—What may be the name Of yonder church? Guide. It bears its founder's name, St. Nicolaus Pontifex, my Lord. Comnenus. Ay, is it so? Alexius, this place I should have known, but that the dusk deceived me. Once in this ground I saw a friend interred, And I would fain revisit now the spot. From hence I know my road. I'll follow you. [Exeunt Alexius and Guide. This is the very earth that covers her, And, lo! we trample it like common clay! Chance shall I call it merely—but blind chance, That at this fateful, questionable hour, Brings me to blunder thus upon the spot That I have shunned for years as haunted ground! Is it not haunted? When I last stood here Disguised to see a lowly girl laid down Into her early grave, there was such light As now half shows it, but a bleaker air, For it was in December. 'Tis most strange; I can remember now each circumstance Which then I scarce was conscious of; like words That leave upon the still susceptive sense A message undelivered till the mind Awakes to apprehensiveness and takes it. 'Twas o'er—the muttered unattended rite, And the few friends she had beside myself Had risen and gone; I had not knelt, but stood With a dull gaze of stupor as the mould Was shovelled over and the broken sods Fitted together; whilst some idle boys Who had assisted at the covering in, Ran off in sport, and trailed the shovels with them, Rattling upon the gravel; the sexton then Flattened the last sods down, and knocked his spade Against a neighbouring tomb-stone to shake off The clinging soil,—with a contented mien, Even as a ditcher who has done his work. I, at that sound, had started from my trance, Conscious of its completion, but the keen frost Had ta'en the power of motion from my limbs. How I came thence I know not, nor dared ask. But now I dare recall these things. Oh, Christ! How that which was the life's life of our being Can pass away and we recall it thus! Irene! if there's aught of thee that lives, Thou hast beholden me a suffering man; Hast seen the mind—its native strength how racked, Hast seen the bodily frame how sorely shaken, And thou wilt judge me, not as they do who live, But gently as thou didst judge all the world When it was thy world.— On many a battle's eve, in many climes, By the ice-caverned course of black Araxes, By Ister's stream and Halys and Euphrates, By Antioch's walls and Palestine's sea-shore, I have addressed wild prayers unto thy spirit And with a mind against its natural bent Tortured to strong devotion, have besought That thou wouldst meet me then, or that denied, That I might seek thy world upon the morrow. And then it would have seemed a thing most sweet, Though awful, to behold thy bodiless spirit. But now—and whether from the body's toil I know not if it be, or fevered blood, Or wakefulness, or from the mind's worn weakness— It were a very terror to the flesh To look on such a phantom:—it is strange That what we have loved and lost we fear to find In any shape,—strange that the form so sweet, So gentle and beloved, I saw laid here, Now new-arisen would make my blood run cold! Up, Moon! for I am fearful of the darkness, And I have heard a voice that cries aloud— Home, home, Comnenus! [A voice at a distance, calling Comnenus. Where hath he a home? His home is with the dead—his home is here— Father of mercies, take him to his home! Enter Alexius. Alexius. Isaac, you stay too long. Comnenus. Ha! What?—too long! Alexius. What ails you? are you present to yourself? I left you but just now. Comnenus. True, 'twas just now. Alexius. And now you look so ghastly! Why is this? Comnenus. Ay, it was something that I saw just now. Alexius. You speak without the concert of your mind; Collect your senses; whence this sudden change? Comnenus. Be not alarmed; 'twas but some idle thought; Nought else,—a bodiless creature of the brain; Think it no more. Alexius, as you said I am a much changed man, and phantoms come Before my sight most palpably like truths, But going thus show clearly what they are. We should survey yon villa on the left; Some fifty men might hold it for an hour And cover our advance till Cos be won. Come, let us onward. Why, you stand amazed. Alexius. Go on; I will not quit you. Comnenus. Time runs out; 'Tis dawn by three o'clock; and ere that hour Macrinus will be up with half his force As far as Ithé. I'll send word—but come— The Moon looms large and shows our footing well. Scene IV. —The Gardens of the Convent of St. Conon.— The Monk Balbinus and an Acolyte. Balbinus. The hour is nigh; anon the Count shall come, And if, as I am bid believe, alone, He shall return no more. Take thou this scroll; 'Tis for the Captain of the Fort; stand close Behind yon statue of St. Isidore; Observe us well, and should I cross myself Fly with it to the Fort; but should I bend And clasp my hands, slink through the thicket hence And meet me at the sacristy. Stop, stay; Not that way or you meet him. This way; see. [Exeunt. Enter Comnenus. Comnenus. Midnight is past; yon western rim of light Is sunken and obscured: not gone though yet: The brow of night is pale—pale, but how lovely! Quieter far than life, than death less dark; A voiceless revelation of the things Which lost their names when Eden was no more. Balbinus. (behind). Cherub and Seraph be your blessing here! Comnenus. But lo! the names are left; oblivion gulfed The nature, essence, notion—not the name; So honoured be the all that earth lost not. I, willing that all words should have their use, Accepted these for watchwords.—Peace, come forth. Balbinus. Cherub and Seraph— Comnenus. Bring thy body forth, So I may deem that heavenly voice incarnate; Come, come, thou know'st me. Enter Balbinus. Balbinus. Holy Mary Mother! My Lord, you're louder than the bell for matins! You'll rouse the brotherhood. Comnenus. Which it did never. Balbinus. To come amongst your enemies alone! It is mere madness, so I bade him say; Perilling alike yourself and me that screen you. Comnenus. Thy counsel whether I should come or not, Was never asked; I sent to bid thee hither And finding thee am satisfied. Alone I have not come, save for the last half mile; Seest thou yon upland; in the dell beyond A hundred horse are browsing. Balbinus. Gracious Powers! You do not purpose an attack? Comnenus. Not yet; Unless perchance my person were betrayed. Balbinus. Surely, my Lord, you question not my faith. Comnenus. I cannot doubt that it behoves thee keep it. Balbinus. Pardon me there! though plighted faith still binds, The rashness of a chief might cast in doubt Which side is safest. Comnenus. Not a whit, Sir, no; By whichsoever is espoused, by that 'Tis safest to abide. Be thou aware It were a fatal error shouldst thou dream That thou couldst secretly espouse my cause And change thy mind at will as things fall out. Thou stand'st committed to the issue; yea My good or evil fortunes thou shalt share. Monk. My Lord, have I desired or more or less? Comnenus. And if, the while, cross tides shall run me hard, And then some subtle spirit in thine ear Whisper “Change sides,” with this thou shalt make head Against that subtle spirit,—thou shalt say,— “Count Isaac, in his cunning malice, bent That none be left unscathed if he be smitten, May have bethought him to leave proof behind Of all our dealings—proof whereof the tithe Were all-sufficient in the Patriarch's hands To doom me to that peace his Church accords To her false brethren.”—In the hour of trial Thus shalt thou fortify thy better mind. Monk. My Lord, a cruel stratagem is yours, If I must needs believe this done, to fix Your follower's faith; but I am yours till death, Though sorely wronged. [Bending low and clasping his hands. Comnenus. Invidious it were To justify to thee the cutting off Of that safe second turn which should insure, Lose they that might, a winning game to thee. To justify is not my present need; To have explained suffices.—By the night, The compline has been done this hour, and now My cousin might come forth. Monk. Not here, my Lord; The trees are ranker to the left, where now She doubtless waits you: in the cloister near Your sister will keep watch; on this side I. The path is at your hand. Scene V. —Another part of the same Garden.—Anna Comnena, alone. Anna. Whate'er the cause I'm glad we meet again; For our last parting was not to my mind— A turning off as who should meet by chance And bid good-morrow—nay, not even that; He did not say farewell, a word though sad One would not leave unspoken—still a sweet sound, Though, it may be, a sound that parts for ever, The dying cadence of a broken chord. He did not say farewell, nor did he look it, Nor kiss it, as he once, though not of late, Was wont to do. I have outgrown the time When all was unsuspected, unsuspicious: And yet I would not be a child again. How quiet is the night—no breath afloat— I hear the kine upon the far hill-side Tear up the long dank grass. And such a morn Will break the rest of this so peaceful night! Hark! what is that? Comnenus (entering). Curse on these birchen boughs; They waked a grey he-owl, who stared amain To see one here that was not of his order. Well met, fair cousin! Short our time is here. Wert thou afraid to come? Anna. Afraid? oh no; I nowhere feel so safe as where you are. Comnenus. Yet few men of a peaceful mind like mine Have brought such dangers both on friends and foes; Not wilfully—in no case wilfully; And now the end is near. Anna. A happy end, Oh yes, a happy, blessed end I trust; And thenceforth and for ever we live in peace. Comnenus. Under his fig-tree each: so be it! Yet At this and all times it befits the brave To look each issue fairly in the face. The courage of the commonalty sinks Unless their hearts be sanguine; victory thus Is in each general's mouth; none cries, Courage, my friends, for wretched is your plight! The chances are against us, Death and Defeat! But by the common cry the common mind Is buoyed aloft: be it not so with us: Whatsoe'er possible evils lie before Let us sincerely own them to ourselves, With all unstinting, unevasive hearts, Reposing in the consciousness of strength Or fervent hope to be endowed with strength Of all-enduring temper,—daring all truth. Anna. I am courageous when you bid me be; But were I left without a friendly voice To strengthen and exhort me,—left alone In some disastrous sequel of this strife, I fear, I fear that I should falter. Comnenus. Nay, The fear of fear redoubles fear of fact, And ofttimes fact is better borne than fear. The worst assemblage of the worst events When actual is not so intolerable As when remote it seems: fancy o'ersteps The bounds of nature, and miscounts the force Of cumulative griefs: a first mishap Has a fair field; the rest are but late comers; The human mind's capacity of pain Is no illimitable attribute. What is it you most dread? Anna. Oh! when I think How many a bold adventurer rose in arms This last indiction, and what fates they met, They who had won and reigned falling in turn, And then behold you standing where they stood, Upon the verge of empire or of— Comnenus. Death, Not excæcation, if the thought of that Calls up these looks of horror. Fear it not. To no such maimed and ignominious close Will I degrade my being. Life is now, I think, with all its evils, eligible; But one sense less would turn the odds against it. Anna. But if this dread conjuncture should arrive, You would not with your own hand cast it off? Comnenus. Not so, if others can be found: my wish Has never been unneedfully to arm My reason or my will against my instincts; What facile guidance nature gives I take; In the sharp interchange of blow for blow Our volatile life transpires at unawares Without the thought of death, whose sting is thought; The easiest permeation of mortality Is this, and this, if need be, shall be mine. Anna. Whilst I behold you standing by my side So full of life, my mind will scarce be brought Fairly to apprehend the fatal change We speak of. Comnenus. Death is but a name to you, Who have but fancied hitherto, not felt A deprivation. May it so remain! To me, acquainted with mortality, A foresight and forefeeling clear and strong Present the image of the hour to come; And come when come it may, death comes to me As a familiar spirit—not desired, Neither eschewed. Some three good hours ago I passed a burial-ground, and pondering there How much by accident it is we live 'Mid all the storms that wreck humanity, I deemed that there was something yet to do To clear the coming hours of anxious thoughts; One possible issue unprovided for. Anna. I can but look to two events; but two: Your victory, which quits us of all cares; Or else your fall; and having proved the worst There's nothing left to fear; Fear yields to Fate. Comnenus. Though I should fall, defeat might not ensue; Alexius might win the crown and wear it. My thoughts were on that upcast; and therewith I called to mind how greatness shuffles off The ties of blood, and oft-divided hearts Break up the fortunes of a new-made house. Anna. 'Twill not be so with ours. Comnenus. That it might not, Is mainly what has brought me here to-night. Nought could secure Alexius on his throne More than Eudocia's counsel; which were lost Should he receive a stranger's hand in marriage. I know my sister's heart, and bear in mind What comes of Aulic councils wherein strives With an Augusta's will a Cæsarissa's. Anna. She must be brave who thwarts Eudocia. Comnenus. Nay; The empress were high-minded who should not. Audacious oftener than unenvious Are women: of them all I know but one From female jealousies by nature free In whom Alexius, should he wear the crown, Would find a fitting consort. You are she. Anna. I! never; never; oh no, never in me A consort could he find; me most unfit For aught but meekly to await the end And mindful of my kindred with your house Weep or rejoice as ill or good betides; In me a consort can he never find. Comnenus. And wherefore? 'Twas in childhood you last met; When you survey him with a woman's eyes You shall confess no woman can resist him. Oh, childhood's independency of heart How art thou lost before the loser wotteth! Why should we doubt the prompt and sure success Of a good soldier like Alexius? Anna. I love Alexius as his cousin ought, But will not wed him: and I say not this, As many a maiden's protest has been said, For a defiance; nor does pride prompt me, Who ne'er was independent of affections, To say, what said shall bind me evermore, That come what may, to him imperial honours, To me distress, bereavement, all that's worst, I will not wed Alexius. Comnenus. How is this? You say you love him as his cousin ought And then forswear him and renounce his works With like devotion as he were the Devil. How know you till you see him grown to man You may not worship him? Armenian girls Call him the Mithra of the middle world That sheds Eoan radiance on the West. Anna. I meaned not to disparage him; oh no, He was a gentle boy, of a kind heart And a quick fancy, and I loved him well. But do not speak of him as now you did; That makes me rancorous in my own despite. Comnenus. I say no more. When time is most to spare There is a sex in reasoning with whom I never misemploy it. True it is That divers motives, many a cogent cause, Affecting first the empire, next yourself, And lastly the Comnenian race, demand Another strain of thought. I press them not. When these want weight, change may be better hoped From passion's mutability. Anna. Oh, God! The last words these may be we speak together, And can you thus embitter them, and all Only because I'm true to my own heart? Comnenus. Far be reproachful thoughts! my fairest cousin Shall be as faultless in my sight as fair, Nor would it derogate from her fair perfection If she should hold her best affections free To change as times change; with no wanton lightness, Nor on vain pretexts, nor from those that are To those that are not worthy; but with judgment, Having regard to who are dead, who live. This only I would ask, but will not urge. When the hour comes I spoke of (if it come) Alexius will better press the pleas That I shall pass away from. Bear in mind In after times what I have here let fall: The seasonable hour will come, though now My counsel seem unacceptable. Anna. Alas! You speak as if you had no hope to live. Comnenus. My way was through a churchyard, whence, as I said, My thoughts have brought away a taint of death. It is my wont upon a battle's eve To invocate a spirit for my guide Which till to-night ne'er answered to my call. What! is the moon so high? 'tis more than time That I were in my camp. Farewell, my cousin. Sinless and blameless as thy life hath been It is not much of ill that can befall thee. Mine has been less so. Anna. First and best of friends, If virtuous, just, and honourable living And gallant deeds could answer for man's weal, Yours were not to be feared. Comnenus. Not much the doubt Comnenus would stand well with times to come Were thine the hand to write his threnody. Yet is he in sad truth a faulty man. In slavish, tyrannous, and turbulent times He drew his lot of life, and of the times Some deep and bloody stains have fallen upon him. But be it said he had this honesty, That undesirous of a false renown He ever wished to pass for what he was: One that swerved much and oft, but being still Deliberately bent upon the right, Had kept it in the main; one that much loved Whate'er in man is worthy high respect And did devoutly in his soul aspire To be it all; yet felt from time to time The littleness that clings to what is human And suffered from the shame of having felt it. But this is posthumous stuff; talk for the tongues That tell their tales when mine are all told out. My gentle cousin, hie thee to cover now. An hour or two and yonder Euxine Sea, That slowly indues its matutinal grey, Shall suddenly change colour like a snake, Enamelled with the glow of other fires Than those of sunrise. Briefly, fare thee well! And whatsoe'er be told of me henceforth A most untruthful annalist were he Who said I did not love my cousin Anna. Anna. Go, dearest kinsman: should we meet no more In many an hour of all my after life Shall this be treasured inmost in my heart As kindness for a last memorial left. Go, and good Angels guard you is my prayer. Comnenus. Good soldiers, Anna. In the arm of flesh Are we to trust. The Mother of the Gods, Prolific Mother, holiest Mother Church Hath banded Heaven upon the side opposed. No matter: when such supplicants as thou Pray for us, other Angels need we none. Now must my horse know nothing of the reins Until the warder's challenge sound a halt. ACT IV. Scene I. —A Chamber in the Bucoleon.—Nicephorus, the Patriarch, and the Abbot of St. Conon's. Abbot. I cannot but commend your Grace's course; She is a woman of ungoverned spirit And were she in her helplessness so urged Might do some violence to herself, which still Men's minds, more prone to scandal than to faith, Would fix upon the Church. Count Lyra's death Is yet a question and a calumny Rife in men's mouths, despite the miracle. Patriarch. It pleaseth God to hasten no man's hour But straight our Order is impeached, as we Could make men linger. Nicephorus. For our present need Reserve we force until devices fail. Abbot. All shall be ordered with the strictest heed To what your Grace directs. Nicephorus. Yet have regard To what runs counter, what occasions serve. In this time's mutability, the pleas That rule one hour the next may abrogate. Wherefore, by due observance of the times Mould thou the means as best to work my end. A woman and a child are easy dealt with. Abbot. To work your Grace's will and save the shrine From the reproach of violence, I will try All gentle and benign devices first . . . Nicephorus. And should these fail to draw the culprits forth Expect my further will. Enough is said. They wait you in Sophia's. Scene II. —A Suburb.—Alexius, his Lieutenant, and Soldiers. Alexius. Stand fast. The Sunian suburb is on fire. Send word to Eulas to advance and storm The Atrian gate; with half his force—no more; The troops that guard it will but feign to fight; They're won. With t'other half do thou thyself Rejoin Count Isaac. There is nought to fear. The famed Varangian brawlers led the flight, Their leader leading them. His father, Anx, Our prisoner, saw it and his bald head blushed. Begone! Remember—half his force. Lieutenant. The rest I carry to Count Isaac. Alexius. Ay, at once. Now with our ladders to the walls, my friends. Scene III. —Interior of the Church of St. Sophia.— Thuriferi swinging censers on each side of the altar. A number of Priests holding tapers and performing from time to time the ritual deosculations of the images. A congregation of old men and women. The Patriarch is descending the steps of the altar. Patriarch. As many goats as sheep.—No more of this— Ye do but bring each runaway and skulk Hither to seek a shelter. Quench those lights. Enter Theodora. Theodora. What doth this people here? What, know they not The battle rages to the very walls And none to man them? An old Man. Princess, we are old. Theodora. Old! and how is it then ye know no better Than thus to cupboard up your vapid dregs Like something precious? Patriarch. Said I not? Lo, there! The very women cry out shame. Away! Enter a Soldier. Patriarch. Whence comest thou? Soldier. From Phenar in much haste. The Emperor is sore beset, and saith Unless some aid be brought that all is lost. Patriarch. Who feareth loss that fighteth for the Lord? Why arms he not the citizens and the slaves? Soldier. They will not arm; I saw them in the streets; Prostrate before the images they lay, Stricken with fear; the ways were filled with monks Passing in long processions to the shrines. Patriarch. Oh, God! raise up thy people. Lo! I take A blessed relic from Sophia's shrine! This sword contains a scraping of the steel Of that spear's head which pierced the side of Christ; What host shall stand against the Lord of Hosts? Arm ye, my children, arm ye for the fight! St. Theodore, St. Maurice, and St. George Shall strike with them that strike with this dread sword. Cast down your lights; find weapons where ye may— What host shall stand against this sacred sword? Scene IV. —The City near the Walls.—A Soldier keeping ward. To him enter another running. 1st Soldier From what side comest thou? 2nd Soldier. From Petræum, covered with laurels. There is nothing in war so glorious as a successful retreat. I have left the dead, but brought off the baggage. [Exhibits articles of plunder. I'll give thee this ring an' thou'lt show me the nearest way into the sewers. 1st Soldier. Dost take me for a scavenger? Thou art for slinking off. 2nd Soldier. I! perish the thought! 'Tis a point of generalship. Didst never hear of a city being surprised through the sewers. If I were there, I could keep the pass against a thousand. 1st Soldier. Indeed, thou wouldst keep it all to thyself, for the thousands are coming the other way—over the walls. But I'll take thy ring, for methinks I know what way thou camest by it; thou hast been killing and rifling thy wounded comrades; I'll take thy ring, and show thee the way to a safer place than the sewers— there— [Turns round suddenly and stabs him. Get thee underground and give me up thy ill-gotten gear. Enter several other Soldiers. 1st Soldier (as he rifles the body). Good soul! wounded to death, I fear me! The best of friends—a military testament—left me all he had—alas! 3rd Soldier. Truly and no little either—ha! Come, let's have fair play,—we will all go shares. Enter an Officer: the soldiers quit the dead man and gather round him. Officer. How fares it here? 4th Soldier. The same as everywhere—ill fare; it fares foully; the sally is beaten back to the walls. Officer. There was a rumour with us that a miracle had been wrought. 4th Soldier. The miracle of making live men dead; I saw no other. But there was the old Patriarch among the foremost soldiers, with a rusty sword that came from Jerusalem. Officer. What did he with it? 4th Soldier. Why, he held it up before the ranks and prayed lustily. The enemy were shy of it till Comnenus rode up and brake it in twain with his lance, and then they all fell on and the sally was driven in. Officer. They say the Emperor was there himself. 4th Soldier. No man in the field fought better. This day has made a soldier of him again. 5th Soldier. Here is some one coming this way. Officer. It is the Emperor and the Eparchs. Jump on to yon wall; you were best not be found doing nothing. [Exeunt. Enter Nicephorus, followed by Eparchs and other Officers. Also the Patriarch. 1st Officer. The sum of all is, he will have no truce. Nicephorus. Ay, but I'll bring him to another mind: Return and say a Synod hath been called Which doth adjudge that by the Nicene canon The Church affords no sanctuary to those She theretofore detruded from her pale. Add that in such sort as he grants conditions Which may spare innocent blood, so shall I deal With his heretical kindred. Get thee gone. [Exit First Officer. The last attack told hardly, my brave friends; Yet was it fairly faced. 1st Eparch. To speak God's truth, I think, my Liege, we had better sped at last Had there been none but soldiers to bring off. 2nd Eparch. When first the monks came out, they gave some spur To the fight; but after, when our line broke up, They were a questionable aid: some stood Like landmarks, others knelt, most ran With more of haste than speed, and shook to air The order of retreat. Nicephorus. The Patriarch's troops Find little favour with my soldiers. Patriarch. Yea; Harlots find favour with thy soldiers; feasts, Riotous feasts, find favour with thy soldiers; And therefore favour find they not with God. Nicephorus. Nay, nay, Lord Patriarch, let's not charge each other With aught that hath befallen. Both did well. May we so aid each other to the end. Re-enter First Officer. 1st Officer. May it please your Majesty, upon the road I learned the Count Comnenus had been lost. The last who saw him said it was apart From the main body, with the troop of horse That drave some friars through the Eastern breach, And thereabouts they found his shield and spear. Nicephorus. Then go proclaim thine errand on the walls, And say, unless an hour shall bring reply St. Conon's is no sanctuary thenceforth For any of his kin. Now to the ditch. [Exeunt Officers, Eparchs, etc. (As the rest go out, the Patriarch detains Nicephorus.) Patriarch. An evil hour were this, should we invade The Church's privilege to prop her creed Or spare her sons. Nicephorus. Extremity, my Lord, Will ever force the cures that wound; 'tis vain To blink them. Patriarch. Vain, if other there were none. Nicephorus. See you not every outwork stands exposed? Nought but an instant truce can save us now, And he will grant it only to redeem These women's lives; so they shall to the walls, And if the Abbot fails to draw them forth They must be brought by force. Patriarch. I grant they must; But was't not said that near the eastern gate The arms of Count Comnenus had been seen And that himself was missing? Nicephorus. So they said. Patriarch. Then let these arms be found, for they will aid Our holy end, to spare the sanctuary From rude irreverent force, too needful else. This must be looked to. Nicephorus. Ho! the signal sounds. Let us not lag behind. Scene V. —The Convent of St. Conon's.—Eudocia and Anna Comnena. Anna. Hark! cousin. Eudocia. I know that sound. It is the Uri's horn. Anna. And look there: yon is not sunrise? Eudocia. No, 'tis the Greek fire on the other side of the hill. Anna. Heaven! is the attack begun, then? Eudocia. I trust in Heaven it is. Enter the Abbot of St. Conon's. Abbot. I come, deputed by the Emperor Upon a gracious mission. I am to say He never warred with women and for you, Whom he holds faultless of this vile revolt, To see you driven like culprits to this strait Afflicts him sorely; and with all respect He proffers an asylum in the palace Where honourable safeguard and respect Await you. Eudocia. Let thy Emperor be told They wait me from a greater far than he, Isaac Comnenus, whom may God preserve! Abbot. I fain would be the bearer, with your leave, Of a more seemly answer; it is fit I bid you know you find not safety here; Mine age, my holy calling, bid me stand Betwixt you and that precipice's brink Whither you . . . Eudocia. Hath your Emperor been pleased To signify his further will through you? Abbot. He gave no further message. Eudocia. Nor do I. [Exit Abbot. Anna. Why do you speak so fiercely? Eudocia. 'Tis all one; The time is passing and the term approaching; When swords are drawn soft words are out of date. Anna. Would it were day! Eudocia. I would it were; this light Shows the old monks like dead men walking. Anna. Yes; None living do I dread as I dread them. Eudocia. Here comes another. Well, thine errand, monk? The Monk enters. Monk. St. Conon's name be praised! Count Isaac's ours. Eudocia. Who sent thee with that tale? It is not true. Monk. St. Conon's name be praised! Lo! hither come His shield and spear; it is the Emperor's will That as a meet oblation they be laid, With fitting rites, before St. Conon's shrine. Enter Monks in procession, bearing the shield and spear, and chanting “Gratias agimus.” They lay them on the altar and with the customary genuflexions and thurifications pass off. Eudocia. Gallant Comnenus! and is such thy fate! The boldest heart in Christendom was thine, And thine, as was thy due, the fastest friends And faithfullest soldiers. Now doth Ruin reign! Now be our race extinct, for never more A name so noble shall adorn its annals. He said be bold and we should meet again; And Heaven shall witness that I have been bold; But never, never as a captive,—no, Not in captivity shall we e'er meet. The term of princely durance is but short. Anna. They cannot slay him—oh no, no, they cannot. The fiercest soldier would not lift his hand Against Comnenus. Eudocia. Tempt not thou thy heart; Yield not to hopes, but arm thee with despair. The stake was noble—'twas the eldest crown In Christendom, and which, if worn by him, Had grown in splendour through a glorious reign. The loss is great;—so might have been the meed. It was a cause worthy my brother's sword. Anna. Oh! holy Father, say they will not slay him. Monk. The Emperor is merciful in judgment; Imprisonment may serve, with loss of eyes. 'Twere safe to blind him. Eudocia. Blind him! slave of slaves, Unworthiest to give utterance to his name! Low in the dust must be Count Isaac's state When such as thou dare breathe thy blights upon him. Monk. Lady, 'twere good you were less splenetic; If you could frame some more becoming speech And audience of the Emperor were obtained Or of the Lady Theodora, then . . . Eudocia. I ask not audience of either—Hark! 'Tis a mere incoherency of mind That angers me with such as thou—attend— Thou bring me to the presence of the Count By any means thou wilt, and I bestow This diamond thy reward. Monk. Then with all haste Set forward to the palace. Eudocia. Who comes here? Enter an Officer. Officer. I bear the Lady Theodora's signet And have it from her Highness in command To say her bidding here. Eudocia. Say on, Sir, speak. Officer. Her Highness gave command that to no ear It should be uttered, save to yours. Eudocia (to the Monk). Thou hear'st. [Exit Monk. Officer. Your pardon, Lady, are there none else near? Eudocia. What fear'st thou? there is no one—none—speak out. Officer. I come from Count Comnenus. Eudocia. Thou from him! Thou comest then from his prison. Tell me where, That I may hasten thither. Officer. From his prison? Far be the prison doors that close on him! His cause is hopeful. Anna. Hopeful, say you? God Be merciful and make that tiding true! His cause is hopeful! Eudocia. And if it prevail, The first and only boon I ask of him Shall be to truss me up these lying monks And sprinkle yonder altar with the blood Of one most just and righteous sacrifice. Where is Count Isaac, Sir? Officer. He bade me tell How all things stood: A spy brought word at dawn That Synods had been holden and some ill There was devised which had respect to you. The sallies from the gates to the south and east Just at that hour grew hotter, but the Count, Seeing the issue was on that side safe, Called from the pursuit a few trusted friends Of whom I rank myself the humblest; these Of shields and spears divested them and crept To some suburban hovels; there they drew Above their armour the monastic garb, Then sped as flying from the enemy And through a breach found entrance to the streets. To waive suspicion then from shrine to shrine, With crosses and mock-relics held aloft, Through awe-struck multitudes they took their way With offerings for each altar. In due time They will approach St. Conon's—whence the Count Sware that no power should drive him till his flag Were flying on Sophia's. Eudocia. A bold oath that! Will he cast off disguise and stand on force So soon as he gains entrance? Officer. When the horns Sound from the steep of Ergon, not till then; But when they capture Ergon, thence the troops Can aid us in good time. Anna. Is he far off? Where didst thou leave him? Officer. In the Kamian way: There he was met by rumours that himself Was captured, and not doubting whence they came Nor knowing but they might work for ill to you He bade me cast my weeds and with this sign (A ring the Princess gave in days of old) Gain access here. Enter an Attendant. Attendant. Your guard is at the gates; The Father waits your coming. Eudocia. Let him wait; Tell him my mind is changed; I will not go. [Exit Attendant. Enter certain of the Brotherhood of St. Conon's, crying “Kyrie Eleison—an offering for the Shrine.” The Comnenians follow, cowled and stoled, with relics and crosses and their offering in a vase. They proceed down the stage and kneel before the curtain of the altar. Enter the Abbot of St. Conon's. Abbot. You must attend me to the palace. Eudocia. How! Abbot. Ay—instantly. A rescript hath arrived; You and your younger relative must go. Eudocia. Invade the right of sanctuary! what words Are these to hear from Churchmen! Abbot. It is vain. A Synod hath been holden and decrees Your heresy has forfeited the right. Eudocia. What if we dare dissent from such decree! Abbot. The secular arm is ready to compel Instant obedience. Soldiers wait without. 'Tis true the Church hath alway reverenced The rights of sanctuary when such protect Offenders against human laws alone; But when Almighty Heaven hath suffered wrong The Church were but a patron of the sin Should she protect the sinners. Ho! the guard! [Here one of the Comnenians, having advanced gradually to the front, steps between the Abbot and Eudocia. Comnenian. Brother, of this the doctrine thou deliverest I cannot tell thee less than that 'tis false. It is a lying doctrine, brother—yea, A doctrine which the Devil hath inspired Into thy Synod and which God abhors. Abbot. And what art thou that thou shouldst interpose? Am I not highest of mine order here? Comnenian. I tell thee that thy words are not of God; Nor shall the touch of secular force pollute This holiest, as the best inhabited, Of all God's dwelling-places here on earth. Abbot. Thou contumacious monk! what right is thine To say to me this shall be or shall not? Ho! the Imperial Guard! thou shalt see proof How what I do in this is countenanced. Dost see this writing? Seest the purple ink? A warrant in the Emperor's very hand Gives order for proceedings to this length. Comnenian. A stronger warrant in Count Isaac's hand Arrests them. [Throws off his disguise and draws his sword. The rest do the like. Abbot. Guards! Ho! Treason! Treason! Help! [Exit. Comnenus. Defend the doors. My bravest of the brave, Well met in any hour! and gentle Anna, A fitter time for greetings shall be ours. Form into line. [The Comnenians form a line on each side, leaving a passage between them down to the altar. My sister, not a man You see before you but in this day's fight Did champion's service. At the altar's foot, Anna and you shall take your station; pass, And as you pass extend a hand to each Of these your soldiers, which, as he receives, He in his martial heart will pledge his faith, Long as it beats with life to fight your battles. Eudocia. My gallant friends, may fairer hands than this Be your reward when this day's work is wrought. [Comnenus leads Eudocia and Anna between the lines down to the altar. The clash of arms is heard without, and the Varangian trumpets. Comnenus draws aside the curtains of the altar. Comnenus. My sister, sit you here. Ha! what be these? Behold a miracle, my spear and shield! Now by the God of battles this is strange Nor less auspicious. To the charge they go. Guards at the doors. We cannot keep the gates; they're not of strength. Comnenus. Back each man to his station. Keep them not. [Varangians defile through the gates. Horns are heard in the distance. Captain of the Varangians. Behold the impious heretic himself! Yield, or be hewn in pieces, thou and thine. Comnenus. If thou wilt do that office on but one Of them thou seest, I pledge my royal word, When I hang up thy rebel-kind to-morrow, To grant remission of thy forfeit head. Enough of talking. Hark! Comnenians, hark! List ye the horns from Ergon. Now, fall on. Down to the dust, idolaters. [As the fight proceeds a cry of “Comnenus” is heard, and Alexius enters at the opposite gates with his soldiers. The Varangians are driven out. Alexius. Well fought, my friends! the last of this day's fight. Behold our flag is flying on Sophia's And ye may sheathe your swords; the day is ours. [The Comnenians shout.“Isaac Comnenus! may he rule us long! Long may the brave Comnenus wear the crown!” [The common soldiers are heard crying confusedly:“Proclaim him Emperor. Go, bring the crown. Where are the purple buskins? Long may he live! Long live Count Isaac!” Alexius. And where is Count Isaac? Several soldiers. Where is Comnenus? A soldier. When I saw him last He passed beside yon image of the Saint. Another. St. Conon's,—ay, and struck it as in sport And split the marble with his glove of mail. Alexius. Gone doubtless to the front. Eudocia! Ah! A happy meeting this! a joy of joys To meet my sister, after all these years, In Victory's hour, with Fortune at her feet. Eudocia. Alexius, God grant you rich reward Of rare desert. A younger face is here, Which you can brighten with a livelier grace. Alexius. My gentle cousin, be this homage yours From all the Eastern Empire. Friends, repair To the imperial palace; as you go Proclaim Count Isaac Emperor through the streets. Sound the Comnenian march. Now, all set forth. ACT V. Scene I. —An apartment in the Prisons. Nicephorus (alone). Morn, let me meet thee face to face once more; Thou look'st upon me with an unmoved front, The pale cold aspect of a wearied friend. Well, well; my race was run; 'tis but in age That Fortune plays me false; 'tis but in age When all that I can lose she doth but snatch Out of the hand of Death. 'Twas in my youth, When she was kind, her constancy bore price; For then there was a life to make or mar. There's many an infant Hercules is dwarfed By lacking a first meal, and me she fed From a full breast and held me by the hand Till I could run alone. She quits me now, But not till time is that I quit the world. Kings ought not to be old. The strength of thrones Is youth. The infirmities of age in Kings Cripple the body politic: first fails Life's vigour at the heart; a numbness next Seizes the weak extremities of empire; Then some old sore breaks out, and all at once The nice adjustments of the strong-knit frame Are rent like rotted ligaments asunder. There's some one comes;—but here's such scanty light— Who stands within the Emperor's prison doors? Comnenus (who has entered) Isaac Comnenus. Nicephorus. Thou art welcome, Count; More welcome to my prison than my palace. Comnenus. I know it. Never was I welcome there. Had I been less obnoxious in thy sight I had not sought thy fall. Nor seek I now Thy further fall than what defence demands. I would give room for thy fast shortening days To gather in the aftermath of life And garner for a better world what here May yet be reaped. Nicephorus. My life! What life is that? A mangled life that crawls along the base Of the huge precipice o'er which it fell; A life that were it whole were little worth At threescore years and twelve, and being pierced With many a mortal wound, may count its price As less than little. Yet I take thy gift. Comnenus. Gladly I find there's aught I have to give Worth thine acceptance. One condition yet Demands fulfilment that the crown be safe; For to that end provision must be made That derogates in some sort from my grant. Nicephorus. Thou aim'st then at my liberty. So be it. The loss of liberty! What loss is that? Who hath it? Not the rich man. Not the poor. The rich of what he owns is owned the slave; The poor a bondsman to necessities, Selling himself in parcels. And a prison! To that old age arrives by Nature's doom, Barring the wrongs of fortune; an old man More meekly may endure it. Comnenus. Somewhat else Remains for stipulation. While thou hold'st Thy station in men's minds as being still One of an order capable of empire, Thy friends will breed expectancy of change. Nicephorus. “Friends” was thy word? in truth an empty fear! My friends! In thousands yesterday at dawn Like leaves in summer did they hang on me; But ere night fell, as with a winter's blight, They were abroad upon the several winds. Now, by God's name, it grieves me to the heart They were not sepultured in yonder trench. Comnenus. Be it thy friends are friends of him who reigns, Thy malcontents will soon be such to us, And every disaffection that may grow Take the good name of loyalty to thee. Nicephorus. What surety wouldst thou have? Comnenus. Assume the tonsure. The service of the Church, whilst it forbids The thoughts men might attach to thee of empire, Becomes thy latter days. Nicephorus. Ay doth it, Count? Hast thou forgotten, in thy feast of power, The tenor of the life thou'dst have me close In mockery of myself? The tonsure, Count! Dim though they be, these latter hours of life, I quickly call to mind the glorious dawn When first amidst Mount Rhodope's defiles A Thracian soldier I took spear in hand; And though that spear be splintered and that hand Be nerveless now, I yet have that within That stoops not to conditions such as thine. A prisoner thou may'st make me,—not a puppet. Comnenus. I meaned no contumely. A fitter time— Nicephorus. No more—I see thee not again—hence-forth All that the Emperor of his gaoler seeks Is that his latter hours be undisturbed. Comnenus. Farewell: but should thy meditations bring Another mood of mind, spare not to speak it. Thy summons on the instant brings me back. [Exit. Nicephorus. My life hath been such life as Kings must bear Who would be more than pageants: it has been A life of anxious, strenuous thought, and deeds That sprang from such: yea and all men must say, Howe'er I governed, it was I that governed: No minister has played the monarch here. I have swayed nations—less by kingly power Than by a power within me which had swayed The minds around me had I not been King. My single destiny is all that now Remains for me to govern; nor shall I Be found unequal to this final charge. How many times in youth a violent death Seemed imminent, yet brought me no alarm And now the loss of so much less of life, And that less portion of less rateable worth, Would surely not seem fearful, but that age Counts with its ills tenacity of life, The old inveterate habit of existence. Enter Theodora. My daughter, com'st thou to console thy sire? Thy filial duty hath not been o'erpaid, But such a time as this were ill employed In aught but kindly speech. Theodora. Father, I come In this most bitter hour to aid your counsels. I have not used (and therefore has our love Held heretofore a not unbroken course) All words of tender import which are rife In women's mouths; and if I had such now What could they profit you? Nicephorus. What hast thou better? Theodora. Daggers. Nicephorus. Hush! hush! that is no woman's word. Theodora. Yea, 'tis a woman's word and woman's weapon. But there are hands to hold them more than mine, Though there be none more steady. Time runs out. The menials of the palace as I came Were busied with the pageant of to-morrow. Grant that a woman's doom had laid in the dust The head which they would crown. Nicephorus. Why were it done, Deem'st thou the difference of a single head Shall quell a reigning faction? Had the blow Been struck while yet the victory was in doubt Their leader lost had been the loss of all; But now 'twere a miracle if they kept not What he hath won. Theodora. Father, your years benumb you. Wherefore is this? the Patriarch wears a coil Of twenty winters more, yet his blood's hot; And I, a woman, do not yet despond. Nicephorus. The Patriarch's fury blinds thee to his dotage. I tell thee there's no hope. As easily Recall the colour to a corpse's cheek As give them heart again. Theodora. You will not hear; The cohort which deserted yesternight, Though paid their hire, were coldly entertained; Wherewith but ill-content, this day they've sworn To rise in arms upon the Patriarch's call. All now is loose, the townsmen and the troops; None careful but the conquered. One blow struck Confounds them in their mirth. Nicephorus. This old man's dream Which he hath told thee doth portend nought else But that a night of blood will interlope Ere the Comnenian dynasty begin. Theodora. My father, hear. Nicephorus. Nay, nay; I know too well That sleepless Chief whose eye is over all, Be feasting they that will. Theodora. Then at your choice Cleave still to your despair. I go,—and soon Here in your cell or on your throne resumed A tale will reach you of as bold a deed As e'er was done by our most martial sires Upon the Thracian hills. Till then, farewell! Father—your blessing. Nicephorus. Oh! my child, much grief, Sore trouble hast thou brought me in my time; But I forgive thee now, nor may I blame This enterprise, all hopeless though it be. Take thou thy father's blessing and depart. I in the inner chamber will go seek That rest the time invites me to. Farewell. Scene II. —A Street near the Palace of the Cæsars.— Isaac Comnenus and Macrinus meeting. Macrinus. Count Isaac, by my life! Well met, my Lord— Nay, your Imperial Highness—pardon me If my first meeting with my sovereign Lord Be something overjoyful. Comnenus. Good Macrinus, There's none entitled to a larger share Of whatsoe'er of joy this hour affords. Where is my brother? Macrinus. In the palace, Sire, And with the rest awaiting you. Comnenus. And where Have you disposed the soldiery? Macrinus. They crowd, And with them half the city, to the square Before the palace; all expectant wait To hail you Monarch ere they doff their mail And with rejoicings close the glorious day. Comnenus. Something too soon, Macrinus. And my guard? Macrinus. They are within, my Lord. Comnenus. So far is well. Are those deserters looked to? Macrinus. Which, my Lord? I knew not that a single friend proved false. Comnenus. Ay, but the false proved friends. Observe them well. I mean that Mæsian cohort—they that oped The Atrian gate to Eulas. Macrinus. By my faith They were but now before the palace; yes; A Lombard shirt of mail they wear, and sword Much like a Frank's—I marked them there but now. Comnenus. March out my guard, and let them be disarmed. Macrinus. 'Twill cause much discontent, my Lord. Comnenus. Why so? They'll share the donative; so say, Macrinus. I will reward them, but I will not trust them. Macrinus. It shall be done, my Lord. And will you then Indulge the impatient multitude that longs To shout their gratulations? Comnenus. Noise and pomp Is what they long for. They will have it soon. To-morrow comes the coronation; then They'll have it to their hearts' content; to-day There's something I would say to them . . . no matter. The Count Alexius, said you, was within? Macrinus. He is, my Lord. Comnenus. A noble youth is he. Macrinus. Indeed he is. Comnenus. And a good soldier too. Macrinus. There's not a man on either side his peer. He has a martial heart. Comnenus. And therewithal The rapid eye, ubiquity of presence, And quickness and collectedness of thought Which give a natural command in war. Macrinus. He has, my Lord. Comnenus. For he was from a boy By care taught conduct. No state-weakling he, Born in the purple and so bred a fool. He is, though young, well practised in affairs. Macrinus. Surely, my Lord. Comnenus. In him there is besides The strong vivacity of youth and health, With something of a gallantry of spirit That wins upon the multitude. Macrinus. Most true. The troops he has commanded love him well. Comnenus. A word with thee, Macrinus—— Hark! the throng Are bellowing my name. Macrinus. My Lord, they wait To take you home in triumph. They're nigh mad. There never was a people so o'erjoyed, Nor ever yet a city that so rang With acclamations; not a troop files by With the Comnenian standard, but the shout “Long live the Emperor Isaac” peals on high As from a thousand voices in one breath. Long may he live and reign! Comnenus. My friend, my friend, There's more mortality about this frame Than known to those who tell its term of years. The worm within may make the building weak Ere Time has leant his weight upon the walls. Well; let us to the palace. I had meant—— But it is needless. From the terrace walk Above the palace gates I'll speak some words To thee, to Count Alexius, and the people. So let us to the palace. But disarm The Mæsian cohort first, forget not that. Macrinus. I'll lose no time, my Lord. Hark! there, again! Scene III. —A suburb.—Theodora and an Officer of the Mæsian Cohort. Theodora. Who wrote it, knowest thou,—this quavering scrawl? Officer. It is the Patriarch's, Lady. Theodora. It is like. Old age hath stricken him. I cannot read it. Officer. Princess, if I may be so bold to guess, His Holiness would see you. Theodora. Wherefore so? Officer. I know not; he is muttering evermore, But none can tell his drift. He lies at length Upon a pallet in St. Cyril's cell. Theodora. This day hath overwrought his aged frame. I will attend him. Keep thy men together, And send me word of whatsoe'er befalls. Scene IV. —A Chamber in the Palace.—Eudocia standing at a casement. Anna sitting near. Eudocia. Look, cousin, look! for a more princely pomp Ne'er blessed a maiden's sight. Anna. I'm sick of shows. What do you see? Eudocia. The troops, a host in arms, Fill up the palace square, and them beyond As far as eye can reach, the multitude Throng through the ways. Hail to that silken flag, The proud Comnenian banner! Long may it float Triumphantly above yon palace gate! Anna. Your heart is in the pageant; you were wont To taunt your sex that they were all for shows. Eudocia. My heart! ay, every pulse of it that beats! And call you this a show? I tell you, girl, That were these squares and palaces black dust, These ways more desert than the Palmyrene, And were all silent save the mouse-bat's wing, So that our banner waved above the waste My triumph would be full. Anna. Well; be it so; I meant not to reprove your triumph. Eudocia. Ah! I see him,—there he comes, and close beside The princely boy Alexius. Heard you that? A shout as of an empire drunk with joy! Again and louder! Hear you? Anna. Now they're still. How suddenly it ceased! Eudocia. He speaks to them. I saw him wave his hand. Anna. Would we could hear! Eudocia. I heard him once address some mutinous troops: 'Twas with a grace so winning yet so bold That their ferocious clamour died away And when he ceased they cried, “Long live the Count!” Anna. See, from their hands he takes the diadem. What means he now? Eudocia. Look! look! Alexius stoops, And on his head he puts the Crown. Anna. And hark! They shout again, and can you not discern “Long live Alexius!” is the burthen now? Eudocia. He has transferred the empire! as I live Discrowned his proper head! (A pause.) It is not well. My life long have I looked to see him crowned, And much I strove and struggled to that end, And thousands toiled with no less zeal, from whom Was much less owing, and have they no claim Who ventured—much or little—all they had, Or might have or might hope to have, for him— Have they no rights? Anna. But should Alexius reign He will be good and generous to them all. Eudocia. Alexius! who's to govern in his nonage? Anna. They ope the gates; the multitude throng in; Some one approaches. Eudocia. Isaac, by his step. I'll tell him all I think. Anna. Oh no, not now; Give him a welcome now. Enter Comnenus. My friend, my cousin, A thousand welcomes leaping to my lips Would fain be uttered if they could. Comnenus. Enough; More than an empire is the worth of one. You stay too long; the tables are all spread. Eudocia. Where is your diadem? Comnenus. 'Tis given away. No more about it—there's a feast below. Eudocia. It is not well to balk your triumphs thus, And cheat the friends who aided you to rise. All was endured for you—ay, in the hope That this which has come would come—that this hour Of full regality would crown the ascent, The perils of the upward path were braved. Comnenus. Eudocia, be content; I could not reign. Eudocia. Not reign! Who says not you were born to reign? Comnenus. I am not of that mind; of what hath been, I can say boldly I was born to that; More can I not,—unless it be worth while To predicate that I was born to die. Engraft, my sister, on a greener stock Your love and pride, and they shall flourish long: There wants not divination of decay In that from which your earlier hopes drew life. Alexius is docile; him your care Shall train to empire, him your counsel teach, As counsel is there none by which in straits I half so much have profited. Now first I need it not; for henceforth there is none Can be of counsel with me. I transfer That with the crown, a not unequal gift Nor ill assorting with imperial power. Eudocia. I know you not; so all unroyal now That rose to royalty so gloriously— Now when all men are gazing at your height As at a ruling planetary power. Comnenus. I never, even when a boy, desired To be star-gazed of men. You could not think it. What I desired has been this day fulfilled; The living of my race are safe and free; The dead are not dishonoured: some firm friends And many loose adherents will be paid, Some less, some more, the wages of their work. This was desired; this was or will be done; And being done, I know not that I owe To dead or living of mankind aught more. Eudocia. And how wilt thou dispose thy future life To profit more thyself? Comnenus. Of that hereafter. Alexius must feast his Lords below, And you assist him. I must give meanwhile Some needful orders and survey the posts Or e'er the night waste further. Fare you well. Eudocia. My noble brother, must you go? Farewell. I said not aught ungentle? if I did, You know that I have loved you from your birth. Comnenus. Not an ungentle word—not one—not one. I'll seek your chamber ere we sleep and court Some further conference. Eudocia. I know not why, But I am loth to see you leave us. Well: Till midnight I shall scarce expect you back; But do not fail me then. Comnenus. About that hour. [Exit. Eudocia. Oh! I forgot—but he is gone. Anna. What is it? Eudocia. I wished to tell him he should take his guard; The city is disorderly—no matter; We'll send Macrinus.—Are you ready?—Come. Scene V. —A Cell in the ruins of a Convent.—The Patriarch lying on a pallet. Enter Theodora. Theodora. All goes as we would have it, holy father; The Mæsian men stand firm and nought transpires. Patriarch. Who is it—Ha? Who's there? Theodora. Most reverend Lord, Arouse you and look up. Our purpose thrives. Patriarch. I say again who is it? Speak, who is it? Theodora. The Princess Theodora. Patriarch. Theodora! What, hast thou stricken him? reach me thy palm. Lo! there's no blood—all over ashy white. The Princess Theodora—why then speak— Say—hast thou dealt the blow? Theodora. Father, not yet; The hour has not yet come. Patriarch. Not yet, not yet? That ever was the cry—when I said, “Strike,” Some coward came between and said, “Not yet.” Theodora. Compose thy mind; the season is at hand, And duly as the day and night go round The work shall be fulfilled; for deeper vows Than ever pilgrim pledged his soul withal Devote me to this deed.—He hears me not. Patriarch. Bring holy water that my hands be cleansed. The Father of the Church this day hath slain Seven men in battle—be his sins absolved. Theodora. Christ! that his senses should forsake him now, At once, and in this need! Arouse thy mind; Father, Comnenus reigns; this very hour He will be crowned; bethink thee of the hour. Patriarch. Think'st thou I hear thee not—beshrew thy shouting— I bade thee smite him and thou brought'st me back A pair of lily palms and saidst, “Not yet.” But hark! his soul is cared for: 'twas my charge And I have tended it: die when he may There is a weight on that—help! I am slain— What traitor drave that spear?—Soft, let me lie. Theodora. Great God! is this his death-stroke? Patriarch. Let me lie— Let me lie down. Theodora. What hinders you, my Lord; Pray you lie down. His back's as stark as steel. He is convulsed.—Help, friends, help! help, without! Enter a Mæsian Officer. Officer. I greet your Highness with but evil news— Theodora. Peace with thy news—seest not the Patriarch ta'en With the death-struggle? help to lay him down. Soft! he's more placid now. Go, call the priests. [Exit the Officer. Lo! his eyes open wide:—how now? Patriarch. Methought That there was some one dying in this house. Who may it be? Theodora. Nay, turn thy thoughts elsewhere; Call on Lord Jesus and His holy mother; Think thou wert ever steadfast in the faith And may'st have hope of grace. Here come the priests. Ill may I do their office. Enter Priests. 1st Priest. Much I fear The life hath left him. Open thou his vest. The pulse is gone—gone utterly—alas! The soul's departed. Theodora. 'Twas an awful strife. Take forth the body. 2nd Priest. Lo, beneath his vest Here is a wound still bloody, and received Doubtless in this day's fight. 1st Priest. And here are scars Of wounds received long since. Men wont to say He was not in his youth the sinless saint We knew him, but a man of lawless life And militant in other wars than ours. Some blood was spilt in stifling of that tale, And like enough he spared the surgeon's aid Rather than show these scars. So—bear him out. [Exeunt Priests with the body. Theodora. This is a fearful hour. A terrible end Was that old man's, and if all tales be true Many a dark deed his soul is charged with. Ay, A fearful hour to usher in an act That may lie heavy on the soul hereafter. Re-enter the Officer. Thou didst not speak thine errand. Speak it now; Now I can hear thee. Officer. By the Count's command The Mæsians have been suddenly disarmed. Theodora. Disarmed! and they resisted not? Officer. Their Chief Had been entrapped before, and when assured That all should have an equal share of spoil They gave their arms. Theodora. My father's word fulfilled! Officer. A few were headstrong, and amongst them I, In cover of a tumult that ensued, Took sword in hand and brake away to you. Theodora. Enough, Sir; I discharge you from all dues Of future service. Officer. I shall ever hold My service at your Highness's command. Theodora. I thank you; for I did not look to find In such extremity a heart so true. My last memorial for service done Is this. Accept it from a fallen friend. [Giving a ring. Now, Sir, farewell; our common cause expires; What may remain is Theodora's; she Will execute henceforth her own behests. [Exit the Mæsian Officer. Enter a Messenger. Messenger. Alas! your Highness, there is grievous news; My Lord, your royal father— Theodora. What of him? Messenger. By his own hand hath died. Theodora. My father dead? Messenger. The warder found him almost cold and stiff; He had been dead an hour. Theodora. No marvel this. To him the bitterness of death was past; He has done well and wisely; in the world He had no more to do; there yet remains A task of mine unfinished. Now, to work. Scene VI. —A large Hall leading to the Banqueting Chamber in the Palace, from which guests are passing out at intervals. In front is the Steward of the Household, with Musicians and other Attendants. Steward. The healths come faster now. Aye, aye, they're breaking up and not a second too soon. Hark! that is our young Emperor's health they're drinking, and his is the last. Now, my masters of sing-song, give him your good e'en. Music. Thou that many a night hast found Soldier's bed on guarded ground, There to sleep and thence to leap Lightly at the trumpet's sound, Softer bed be thine to-night; Other summons than to fight Wake thee with the morning light; Rise to-morrow and be crowned. [Whilst this is sung, Theodora has entered, as a suitor, in a mourning dress with her face veiled. Steward. Stand all aside, the guests are coming out. What wait'st thou for? Make way there! Ho! make way. Theodora. I wait for Count Comnenus. Steward. He's not here. Theodora. He's coming here? Steward. I cannot tell. Stand close. Count Cataculo coming out—make room— That brave commander—noble Cataculo. Theodora. Is he not coming here? Steward. I cannot tell; He ne'er was well affected to a feast, And speaks irreverently—friends, stand back— Of wine that's older than himself—room ho!— The only sin that I can charge him with, God save his soul in heaven! Theodora. Amen, amen. Steward. Paleologus coming out—St. George! That bark's deep laden; Scian wine's aboard; Yon was a heavy lurch. Paleologus. Good friends, good night. Your servant. Let me hold you by the arm; For, pardon me, you seem to walk but so-so; Nay, never mind, I'll steady you; I'm sound; No milksop neither; but I hold it good That alway one keep sound to help the rest. So,—steadily—on this side of that lady— This side the lady in the grave-clothes—Ha! This side the apparition—cleared, by Jove! And so a fair good-night to ghosts in black. [Going, returns. And tell Count Isaac, I forgive Count Isaac For being thrifty of his bounteous presence; For I've a guess, a shrewd one, mark you me, A shrewd conjecture of the why and wherefore,— And to be wise and say no more about it, I think it may be he's too drunk to come. [Exit. Theodora. Hark you; the matter that I bring the Count Concerns his life. Steward. How mean'st thou? Theodora. Yea, it doth. The scurvy citizens are not content, And ever and anon some knave cries out His house is plundered and Count Isaac's men Have stolen his supper and debauched his wife. Then lays the rogue his hand upon his hilt And turns the matter in his beggarly mind, Feeling dissatisfied: so walks he forth, And no one's eye is on him. Steward. In good truth, Thou hast described a dangerous man; i' faith, They're very dangerous, your hungry men; They have no charity for us that eat; I ever said, put hungry men in prison, Else you shall surely have them discontent. Theodora. Yet for the time, seeing there's no offence, They go at large unheeded. Steward. No offence? What call you then the lack of charity? The lack of Christian charity? What, none? By my salvation, 'tis a foul offence, An infamous transgression, which begets Much peril to us powers that be. Theodora. I say There is a danger nearer to the Count Than any you surmise: where is he? Steward. Well, He will be here anon and thou shalt see him. Away. The guests are rising all. Away. Scene VII. —The Banqueting Chamber. Enter Isaac Comnenus and Macrinus, with an Attendant. Comnenus. The guests have all departed? Attendant. All, my Lord. Comnenus. Here, take my sword. Bring me a cup of wine. [Exit Attendant. And he is dead? Macrinus. He bled to death, my Lord. A barber there had left the instrument Wherewith he did this violence to himself. Comnenus. Farewell, Nicephorus the first and last! Soldier of fortune, bold and free in Thrace, Poor abject Emperor in Byzantium! He's better dead, so let us hope, by much. Thou wouldst not think it, friend, but it is true, Had I been of this war the wilful cause, I could have killed myself for conquering As soon as he for suffering defeat. Though it be not a soldier's word to say, The sight of all this blood has sickened me. Macrinus. No blood has needlessly been shed by us. Comnenus. By us, I trust, no drop. But think, Macrinus, When civil war's afoot, whate'er the cause, And whosoe'er the leaders, in the fray How many a beast breaks loose and roams abroad In shelter of an honourable name. Go, good Macrinus, give my orders forth That whosoe'er unsheathes his sword to-night But at the word of his commander, dies; And in the public view of all who pass Plant in each quarter where the throng is thick A headsman and his block. Look it be done. If chopping off of heads can stop the course Of these disorders, I will have them stopped. Macrinus. I will about it straight. Comnenus. Good night, Macrinus. [Exit Macrinus. (After a pause). So here am I, to say my work is done. Thus churchyard visions mock us as we merit, When man, for lack of manliness, is made A lazaret for the mind's maladies. [Walks to a casement. How changed those skies from what they were at eve! They change as do the destinies of men, And give no warning,—or at best a brief one. Black, save a seam, a trench, a gaping chasm Of ghastly moonshine betwixt cloud and cloud! And therewithin a pale and shivering star, Like hope in far futurity, a gleam Of half-extinguished light still struggles on.— I feel that chill and heaviness of cheer Which follows oft a chase that's hotly won; For then the hazards and vicissitudes, The pride of conflict, spur of opposition, The quickening sense of danger, and the need And exercise of wit, are all effete; And the reward of all (which seen remote Shone like a Caucasean peak at dawn) Meets with a cold reality the touch And bares the blank and nothingness of life.— Were I a man to take delight in crowns, And purple boots, and sending forth of bulls, And dealing out of dignities,—to wit, Calling this man Sebastos and that Cæsar, Bidding one worthy follower wear red hose, Another hope the like advancement soon And wear them mottled in the mean time—yea, Could I rejoice in royal sports like these, I should exult in this day's victory And not feel all this barrenness within. I will go hence to-morrow. Re-enter Attendant with wine. Comnenus (drinks). Ho! the Gods! That re-creates the spirit. Marvellous! How this amalgam of a body and soul Can grain by grain so interpenetrate That washing of a ventricle with drink Shall strengthen and uplift the low-laid mind. Oh, then what potent menstruum is that Which shall dissolve the so compacted compound And segregate the subtler element To live apart when all the other dies. Enter Alexius. God save your Highness! Well, how speed you now? To her Imperial cousin what saith Anna? Alexius. When first I spoke she said at once 'twas vain; But when I urgd your sanction to my suit, She faltered and grew pale, then turned away, Nor honoured me with one look more. Comnenus. So fixed! Then shall she have her way and follow me; And though a wanderer on the earth am I, I will requite her constancy with care And in that care may chance to find at times A resting-place myself. Alexius. God grant it you! Comnenus. He will, He will. Some minutes ere you came A kind of vision had enwrapped itself Around me like a winding-sheet. I saw I know not what phantasmas, and was moved To moralize the matter of that change Which theologians call—how aptly, say— The quitting of a tenement, or else The casting off old clothes—the . . . Oh, the gods! The figures are as multitudinous And ugly as their archetype. Alexius. To me These seem as apt as any. Comnenus. Even so.— The Prophet of the Zend expounded thus The secret of original sin: he said When Light, the Power of Good, created man, Him Evil followed darkly as his shadow. And this is fair philosophy, whereby We typify what is not understood, And say a thing is thus, and thus, and thus, Just as another thing is thus and thus, Though how or wherefore either thing came thus We nothing know. Enough. One week from this Will find me a day's journey on the road To the Illyrian frontier. Who is here? Eudocia and Anna. Take apart Our sister sage, thy Councillor of State, And leave to me my Anna. I would hold Some present conference with my gentle friend. Enter Eudocia and Anna Comnena Alexius, advancing to meet them, leads Eudocia to the farther part of the stage, where he remains with her. What ails thee, Anna? Why this changing cheek? What rainbow is reflected in those eyes? What dream hath moulded that pathetic mouth? Thy lip hath pouted at an Emperor's suit, And pouts it now repentant? Anna. Oh no, no! Though I were truly what I ought to be, A lifelong and perpetual penitent, Yet never could my soul repent of that. Comnenus. Then are we two at odds with empire both; And being therein of one mind and heart What should gainsay us that from this time forth Our hearts and lives be one? Thou know'st not, Anna, How wide the vacancy, how deep the void, That opens here, which empires could not fill, Nor worlds—nay, weep not— Anna. It is not for grief. I hear you say that you are desolate, Yet feel no pang! My heart is not my own, To be so happy, knowing you are not. But onward I am looking, and rejoice To think my eyes shall be upon you ever;— And ever watching you, if haply once I chased but half a sorrow from your soul, 'Twould fill me with such gratitude to God, That suffering with you still, though for you too, I scarce should seem to suffer. Comnenus. Born of Heaven Love hath an empire o'er the spirits of pain Beyond all earthly powers; else loth were I To see thy lucid life obscured in mine. But in the sun and summer of thy love, My life shall live anew. [Alexius advances, leaving, Eudocia, who is joined by Anna. Alexius. If go you must We will not quarrel for the day and hour. First to Illyrium, is it? Comnenus. Thither first, If Anna shall forbid me not; for there Some present propping will your State demand Ere it be stablished. Now the little left Of this night give to sleep. Good night, good night. Alexius. In the left wing the Protovestiary Hath seen your couch prepared. Comnenus. No need of that; In the adjoining chamber I'll lay by These heavier trappings, write a rescript there, And take what rest I may. Again good night. [Exit. Anna (in discourse with Eudocia). . . . I cannot tell you how it startled me; And surely it was strange—still whensoe'er A health was drunk and guests grew clamorous, That ominous figure glided into sight, Looked slowly round and vanished. Alexius. I gave leave All should have entrance to the lower hall To witness the festivities. This one Had been some straggler. Anna. But her mourning dress? Alexius. She was a suitor for some forfeit head, And thought to move compassion by her garb. Anna. Her face was veiled, but truly hers was not The bearing of a suitor. There was too At times a something I had seen before— —Oh, God! I see it now— Enter Theodora. Eudocia. Hush! 'tis the Princess. Theodora. Ye have feasted full, And ye are merry. I must kneel to beg A humble boon—the body of my sire. Alexius. Your pardon, if my officers imposed Such and so needless an indignity. The fitting orders I will give myself. Theodora. I know thee not, nor seek I aught of thee. I am a suppliant to the Count Comnenus. (To Eudocia.) Thou knowest there hath that between us been Which makes it fitting I receive my suit In audience from himself. Eudocia. Doubtless, to-morrow . . . Theodora. Much is the doubt what morrows bring to them Who tire of their to-days. 'Tis now, now, now, That I must see him, or else never more. Eudocia. Through yonder door, then, if you pass . . . She's gone. [Exit Theodora. Alexius. Her purpose is apparent; she will tread Fast in the footsteps of her father. Eudocia. Yes; And by her looks I doubt if even now There be not poison working. I repent That access has been granted her. Go in— I fear she may design . . . Anna. Hark, hark!—a groan—— [All rush into the inner chamber, whilst Theodora, passing out from it, crosses the stage, holding in her hand a dagger covered with blood. END OF VOL. II.</field>

MACREADY, TO WHOSE EXCELLENT JUDGMENT IN MATTERS OF ART THIS WORK IS LARGELY INDEBTED, IT IS WITH SINCERE RESPECT AND REGARD VERY GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED. Ladon House, Mortlake, 1st May, 1850. THE VIRGIN WIDOW; OR, A SICILIAN SUMMER. ACT I. Scene I. A Quay in front of the Palazzo Malespina at Palermo.—Spadone, Boatswain, and Mate. Spadone. When your Marquis turns merchant, see you the way of it! No sailing orders, and as much gone in demurrage as would buy a cargo. Boatswain. West-South-West! as I'm a living soul, and as merry a breeze as ever gave a big belly to the fore-topsail! Our chaplain on board the Rombola used to say that there were seven cardinal sins in sea-divinity, and the worst of them was to keep a fair wind waiting. Spadone. And a cargo too that longs for us. When we reach Rhodes, we shall take such a treasure of jewels and ingots aboard as the good ship never lodged before. Mate. Gold and jewels is a good cargo; for 'tis they that bring a man fair weather in this world. Spadone. 'Tis a cargo would buy fair weather for us three for the rest of our lives. But we'll talk of that aboard. Go thou, Antonio, and get me my orders. Mate. Where shall I find you? Spadone. In the catacombs. Thou knowest the cavern where we hid those silks we brought from Genoa. Aretina is to meet me there. Mate. There, then, I will seek thee. Spadone. But take heed to thy steps; for the worthy Noah's forefathers that lived in the bowels of the earth were men of crooked ways and their paths are hard to hit. Go aboard, boatswain, and get the water stowed. We shall surely sail to-night. [Exeunt. Enter Gerbetto and Fra Martino. Gerbetto. I ever found your counsel wise and sure. One thousand ducats are well nigh mine all; The earnings of a life of infinite toil. Fra Martino. The Marquis should disperse them in a day And think the ducats and the day well spent. And as for means of payment, you should know The lands of Malespina stand impledged For what he owes Count Ugo. Gerbetto. From his birth I have denied him nothing; almost loved The wants that sent him to me, hoping still That as he grew to ripeness, what was soft Would harden in him, what was hard would soften; For he was of a sweet and liberal nature. But lending this to lose it, robs my child, My poor Lisana, of that little store I gather'd for her dowry. Fra Martino. For what end? Not for his good,—be wiser than to think it. Give thou to no man, if thou wish him well, What he may not in honour's interest take: Else shalt thou but befriend his faults, allied Against his better with his baser self. Gerbetto. Look! who be these? the Marquis and his friends. A banquet waits them at the palace. Ah! A greeting by the way. he cannot pass, No not a dog nor cat, but he must speak. Let us begone, for I were loth to meet him. Scene II. The Palazzo Malespino—Silisco, Ruggiero, and other Noblemen. Bruno and Conrado. A Manager and three Players. Singing and Dancing Girls, and amongst the former Aretina. Silisco. Off with these viands and this wine, Conrado; Feasting is not festivity: it cloys The finer spirits. Music is the feast That lightly fills the soul. My pretty friend, Touch me that lute of thine, and pour thy voice Upon the troubled waters of this world. Aretina. What ditty would you please to hear, my Lord? Silisco. Choose you, Ruggiero. See now, if that knave . . . Conrado, ho! A hundred times I've bid thee To give what wine is over to the poor About the doors. Conrado. Sir, this is Malvoisie And Muscadel, a ducat by the flask. Silisco. Give it them not the less; they'll never know; And better it went to enrich a beggar's blood Than surfeit ours;—Choose you, Ruggiero! Ruggiero. I! I have not heard her songs. Silisco. You sang me once A song that had a note of either muse, Not sad, nor gay, but rather both than neither. What call you it? Aretina. (touching her lute). I think, my Lord, 'twas this. Silisco. Yes, yes, 'twas so it ran; sing that, I pray you. Aretina. (sings). I'm a bird that's free Of the land and sea, I wander whither I will; But oft on the wing I falter and sing Oh fluttering heart, be still, Be still, Oh fluttering heart, be still. I'm wild as the wind But soft and kind, And wander whither I may The eye-bright sighs And says with its eyes, Thou wandering wind, oh stay, Oh stay, Thou wandering wind, oh stay. Silisco. There! have you heard elsewhere a voice like hers? The soul it reaches not is far from Heaven, Is't not, Ruggiero? Ruggiero. To say ay to that Were for myself to claim a place too near; For it not reaches only, but runs through me. Manager. Now, had she clapp'd her hand upon her heart In the first verse, which says “Oh fluttering heart” . . . 1st Player. And at “oh stay” had beckoned thus or thus . . . 2nd Player. And with a speaking look . . . . Manager. But no—she could not— It was not in her. Silisco. You'll not take the gold? Wear this then for my sake; it once adorn'd The bosom of a Queen of Samarcand And shall not shame to sit upon this throne. [Hangs a jewel round her neck. Aretina. My heart, my Lord, would prize a gift of yours, Were it a pebble from the brook. Silisco. What ho! Are not the players in attendance? Ah! A word or two with you, my worthy friends. 1st Girl. Why, Aretina, 'tis the diamond Was sold last winter for a hundred crowns. 2nd Girl. A princely man! 3rd Girl. In some things; but in others He's liker to a patriarch than a prince. 1st Girl. I think that he takes us for patriarchs, He's so respectful. 2nd Girl. Tell Spadone that; Bid him believe such gifts are given for nothing; A diamond for a song! 1st Girl. Well, let it pass; We're none of us St. Ursulas; forsooth Even I have tripped at times; and Adrian swears That on your mouth as many kisses meet As on St. Peter's toe. 2nd Girl. Speak for yourself, And let my mouth alone. Silisco. With all my heart; We'll have the scene where Brutus from the bench Condemns his son to death. 'Twas you, Ruggiero, Made me to love that scene. Manager. I think, my Lord, We pleased you in it. Ruggiero. Oh you did, you did; Yet still with reservations: and might I speak My untaught mind to you that know your art, I should beseech you not to stare and gasp And quiver, that the infection of the sense May make our flesh to creep; for as the hand By tickling of our skin may make us laugh More than the wit of Plautus, so these tricks May make us shudder. But true art is this, To set aside your sorrowful pantomine, Pass by the senses, leave the flesh at rest, And working by the witcheries of words Felt in the fulness of their import, call Men's spirits from the deep; that pain may thus Be glorified, and passion flashing out Like noiseless lightning in a summer's night, Show Nature in her bounds from peak to chasm, Awful, but not terrific. Manager. True, my Lord: My very words; 'tis what I always told them. Now, Folco, speak thy speech. Bruno. A word, my Lord; The Maddelena's mate is here without, And craves to see you. Silisco. Call him in. Your pardon. [To the players. One moment and we'll hear you. Ruggiero. 'Tis a speech That by a language of familiar lowness Enhances what of more heroic vein Is next to follow. But one fault it has: It fits too close to life's realities, In truth to Nature missing truth to Art; For Art commends not counterparts and copies, But from our life a nobler life would shape, Bodies celestial from terrestrial raise, And teach us, not jejunely what we are, But what we may be when the Parian block Yields to the hand of Phidias. Enter Mate. Silisco. Well, what cheer? Mate. Spadone sends me, Sir, for sailing orders; The wind is fair, and we may lose a day That's worth a week. Silisco. Ay, say ye so? But stop; Where may these Jews be found? You cannot sail Without their warrants of delivery Upon the goods at Rhodes. Bruno. My Lord, the Jews Have been these three hours in the outer hall Much kicking of their heels and cursing Meroz. You would have heard them, but I shut the door By reason of the smell. Silisco. Oh, bring them in. Aretina (to the Mate.) To meet him in the Catacombs? I will. Take this, and tell him not you saw me here. [Gives him money and exit. Silisco. Poor gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim! I had forgotten them. Ruggiero. The day will come When they will not permit you to forget them. Your bondsman, Haggai, will be then perchance Your Lord and Master. Silisco. When is that to be? Oh, thank you; in the reign of Tush and Pish. Ruggiero. Farewell. I would not willingly look on Whilst knavery prospers. Knavery, did I say? Haggai and Sadoc, if I rightly read The docket Nature scribbles on their skulls, Are not more knaves than ruffians. Bear in mind The Zita is in sight, which brings my friends From Procida. You promised we should meet At vespers, on the shore, to see her in. [Exit. Silisco. Farewell. And you, my friends. I thank you all. If business will not wait upon my leisure, Still less shall you. To all a kind farewell. [Exeunt all but Silisco and the Mate, Bruno, and Conrado. Enter Haggai, Sadoc, and Shallum. Silisco. God save you, Jews; have you brought me those writings? Haggai. Your worship shall behold them: here they be. Two skins. Silisco. “To the rich and worshipful Nimshi, our brother at Rhodes, these:”—This is the order for the treasure. Take it, Mate, and begone; and by sunset let the good ship Maddelena look small in the offing, like a lobster with its legs up. [Exit Mate. What next? the charter-party. Fifty ducats per diem —crew to be found in all things needful,—was it so?— Freightage—demurrage—brokerage— Brokerage! Why Haggai, the ship being thine own and the bargain struck betwixt thee and me, whence is the brokerage? I saw no broker. Haggai. Your worship shall understand. In taking of a ship on freight, there ever comes betwixt him that owns her and him that takes her, that useful and that profitable man, a broker. 'Tis the law and the usage. Is it not, Sadoc? Is is not, Shallum? Sadoc. The law and the usage. Shallum. Justly the law and usage. Silisco. But is that useful, profitable man invisible? for I saw him not; I dealt not with him. Haggai. Your worship shall understand. Lo! the times are evil, and hardly shall your servant live if he sweat not in two callings. Truly I own a ship, and in the way of an honest industry I do likewise follow the occupation of a broker. Silisco. Oh! I see. Thou wert thyself that profitable man. Haggai. At half the charge that it should have cost you else. Was it not, Sadoc? Sadoc. Yea, and that half halved. Haggai. Was it not, Shallum? Shallum. Truly, Sir, for a reasonable broker, there is none other that I can commend you to but only the worthy Haggai. Silisco. To make a bargain 'twixt himself and me. What is the other? Oh! the mortgage. Stop. Haggai. His worship calls. Sadoc. Ho! pen and ink. Shallum. Lo, here! Silisco. If I understand this writing, it pledges, not Villa Guastata only, but my other effects whatsoever. Haggai. Villa Guastata! Woe is me! I travelled and gat me to the spot. Woe! Woe! Woe! a desolation and a hissing! Silisco. Nay, nay, Haggai; the property is sufficient for the charge. But as I have a purpose of payment, I care not what effects thou makest answerable. [Signs the deed. There—have we made an end? Haggai. Of this present business. But there be certain lands at Punto Vecchio that bring your worship but little profit at present. . . . . Silisco. My worthy masters! Lo! the times are evil! Surely your servant in more ways than one Must use his diligence; and having spent The past hour greatly to my profit here The next I purpose spending in the woods Amongst the nightingales. God speed you, Sirs. Scene III. —The Catacombs under the Western Suburb of Palermo.—Aretina alone. Aretina. He loves my singing, but he loves not me. How should he? knowing me so vilely link'd With this Spadone. To have fallen was sad, But for the love of such a knave as this To fall, was falling doubly;—not as Eve Lured by the fruit, but by the Serpent's self. Yet is the Serpent not so very wise, To think that, having fallen, I am his For ever, and must evermore misdeem His venom to be nectar. No, could I pierce The plot that now he hatches—sure I am There's perfidy design'd—the last were this That I should see of these detested caves, Or of this wretch and his barbarities. Enter Spadone. Spadone. According to thy wont—blear-eyed, I see. What has sprung the leak now? Aretina. Were I to tell you I should find no pity; so I may keep my counsel. Spadone. Pity! As great a pity to see a woman weep as to see a goose go barefoot. 'Tis their nature. But, hark you, my girl; if gold can make you merry, you shall not maunder long. When I come back from Rhodes . . . . Aretina. Yes. Shall you bring much gold with you? Spadone. Treasure upon treasure! heap upon heap! Here, in this very cave, you shall see it; and what is more, you shall have it in your keeping. For when I shall have seen it safe with you, it will be needful I should make away for Calabria and whistle off a month or two till I shall see how things be taken. Aretina. But whence will this treasure come? Spadone. When the Maddelena shall be seen in the offing, hie thee hither. Wait not till she comes into port, for that may chance to be a tedious time; and if they should tell you that we have gone to the bottom, heed not that; for you shall find me here notwithstanding. Aretina. But tell me, whence is the treasure? Spadone. For the gold, it comes out of the bowels of the earth. The diamonds were digged up in the further Ind. Touching the pearls, thou shalt ask of an oyster; and in respect of the jewels, a toad could tell thee somewhat. Hark! I hear the Mate bellowing for me through the caverns like a calf that has lost its dam. Fare you well! Aretina. Here then we meet when you return. Farewell. [Exit Spadone. And for the gold you boast of, whence it comes You know not better than I know myself. It is Silisco's gold. Whither it goes, You know not better—nor so well. In trust For him I'll take it. Falsehood to the false Is woman's truth, and fair fidelity. Scene IV. —The Sea-shore near Palermo.—Silisco and Ruggiero. Silisco. With what a saucy, blithe, and buxom grace She breasts the blushing waters. Fare thee well, Thou good ship Maddelena. Welcome home, Thou good ship Zita. Ruggiero. But the wind that speeds That outward-bound, baffles this homeward bark; She cannot cross the bar; and what is that? Look there—a boat is pushing from her side To bring her charge ashore. Silisco. The richest freight That ever Procida produced, they say, This Countess is—heiress to all the wealth Of old Ubaldo. Is she fair beside? Ruggiero. Indeed she is. Silisco. As fair as she that comes In her fair company? Ruggiero. As Fiordeliza? In my allegiance, I must answer, No; Yet each is in her kind supremely fair. Silisco. Thou painter, poet, moralist, what not? Show me their pictures—say them, sing them, paint them. Ruggiero. Painting is perilous when the proof is near; Yet take, to pass the time, some rude attempt. Silisco. First for the island Countess. Ruggiero. First for her: In the rich fulness of a rounded grace, Noble of stature, with an inward life Of secret joy sedate, Rosalba stands, As seeing and not knowing she is seen, Like a majestic child, without a want. She speaks not often, but her presence speaks, And is itself an eloquence, which withdrawn, It seems as though some strain of music ceased That fill'd till then the palpitating air With soft pulsations; when she speaks indeed, 'Tis like some one voice eminent in the choir, Heard from the midst of many sweetly clear, With thrilling singleness, yet just accord. So heard, so seen, she moves upon the earth Unknowing that the joy she ministers Is aught but Nature's sunshine. Silisco. Call you this The picture of a woman or a Saint? When Cimabue next shall figure forth The hierarchies of heaven, we'll give him this To copy from. But said you, then, the other Was fairer still than this? Ruggiero. I may have said it; I should have said she's fairer in my sight. Yet must mine eyes be something worse than blind And see the thing that is not, if the hand Of Nature was not lavish of delights When she was fashion'd. But it were not well To blazon her too much; for mounted thus In your esteem, she might not hold her place, But fall the farther for the fancied rise. For she has faults, Silisco, she has faults; And when you see them you may think them worse Than I, who know, or think I know, their scope. She gives her moods the mastery, and flush'd With quickenings of a wild and wayward wit, Flits like a firefly in a tangled wood, Restless, capricious, careless, hard to catch, Though beautiful to look at. Silisco. By my faith She's a wild growth, to judge her by her fruits, For she torments you vilely. Prudent friend, Rosalba being what you say, why fix Your heart on Fiordeliza? Ruggiero. Wherefore? why? When hearts are told by number, weight, and measure, I'll render you a reason for my love; Till then, I say it was my luck to love her; Ill luck or good, I know not yet. For you, I would it were your luck to love Rosalba, So you might wed her; but the rumour is That she is brought from Procida to be given To old Count Ugo. Silisco. Good old man, he's welcome; A simpler-hearted creature never lived To put on spectacles and see the world Grow wise and honest, and I wish him joy. And I will take example by him too And marry when I'm seventy; and till then I'll live as heretofore and take delight In God's creation revell'd in at large And not this work or that. Ruggiero. So do; 'tis best So long as it suffices. See how fast The light skiff shoots along; a few pulls more Shall bring them in. Silisco. Now show me which . . . oh! she In the red scarf is Fiordeliza. Ruggiero. Yes; They know me now and kiss their hands. At first You'll think Rosalba fairer. Silisco. By my faith If what I there behold be flesh and blood Nature can fashion counterfeits of Saints More cunningly than you; in Nature's right My hasty commendation I recall And say your picture was as cold as clay And colour'd from the vapours of the north. Ruggiero. Easy your oars, good coxswain! way enough! A thousand welcomes! Ladies, if the hearts That leap to meet you. . . . . Silisco. Make you footing sure; Jump out my lads and steady her . . . there . . . . so. Enter, landing from the boat, Ubaldo, Rosalba, and Fiordeliza, with sailors and attendants. Ruggiero. Oh my good Lord, the King has miss'd you much. Ubaldo. Has he, Sir, truly? well, he's kind; but we That will have children, are enforced at times, Losing the courtier's in the father's office, To dance attendance on a chit like this. Bring the goods after. To the palace; come. Fiordeliza. Kind ocean, fare thee well! I would that earth Demean'd herself no worse. I'll stamp upon her. Ruggiero. What is your quarrel, Lady, with the earth, Are not her titles equal to the ocean's? Fiordeliza. The earth breeds men, Sir, but the ocean fish. Ubaldo. Rosalba, are you lost? Come on, come on. I crave your pardon, Sir, I should have known you; My Lord of Malespina, if I err not; In health, I hope, Sir? Ah, Sir! youth and strength— We prize them when they're gone; we prize them then. Silisco. I thank you, Sir, I thank you; I am well; I wish you a good voyage. Ubaldo. God be praised, Our voyage, which was very good, is done. This way, child; are you dreaming? Sir, sometimes When duty calls you to the palace, think Of the old Chamberlain; in sooth, my Lord, We shall most gladly greet you. Fare you well. [Exeunt all but Silisco. Silisco. I answer'd like an idiot. So I felt; Doubtless so look'd. Can I not lose my heart But I must lose my understanding too? Count Ugo! He's a gallant light and gay To what I seem'd—a very dullard I, If not a dotard. Can a man so change In less than fifty years, and be himself And yet withal belie the self he was An hour—a minute, I might say—before? But we shall meet again—perhaps to-morrow— And I'll shake off the stupor of to-day And be my better self. To-morrow! yes— I am not in my nature what I seem'd— That all Palermo's tongues will testify— And there is that within me springing now Shall testify it better. Hope and Joy, My younger sisters, you have never yet Been parted from my side beyond the breadth Of a slim sunbeam, and you never shall; Already it is loosen'd, it is gone,— The cloud, the mist; across the vale of life The rainbow rears its soft triumphal arch And every roving path and brake and bower Is bathed in colour'd light. Come what come may I know this world is richer than I thought By something left to it from paradise; I know this world is brighter than I thought, Having a window into heaven. Henceforth Life has for me a purpose and a drift. ACT II. Scene I. —An Avenue in the Gardens of the Palazzo Malespina. In the back scene tents are spread for a fête champêtre. —Conrado and Bruno. Conrado. And all for her! Well, she's a gracious lady; But there's a measure, master Bruno. Bruno. Yea, She's a sweet lady, but she's costly, Sir. The tournament, the banquet, and the masque Shall reach a thousand ducats—in one day— Gone in one day! the lands of Malespina Are broad and fat; but all things have an end. Conrado. A thousand ducats! Bruno. Ere yon sun be set. Conrado. And shall he win her when his all is spent? True, she is heiress to Count Procida And rich enough to marry one that's poor; But wealth will after kind,—it will, it will. Attendance! here's the King! Bruno. Fall back a space And make a sign to yonder gilded troop To sound their cornets. [Exeunt. Enter The King, Silisco, and Ruggiero. The King. I grudge you not your victory in the tilting; for there were eyes fell with my fall which I think better of than of any that blazed at your triumph. Who was she that cried out so piteously? Silisco. Sir, 'twas the little Lisana, daughter of your Majesty's Physician, Gerbetto. Ruggiero can tell you more of her than I. He frequents her for her singing. The King. A good musician is she? Enter Ubaldo, Rosalba, and Fiordeliza. Ruggiero. Sir, she's young, Yet I have heard some adepts in her art Who pleased me less; for she is true, yet free, Abandon'd to her strain, and hath a voice That whoso' hears feels for the time no touch Of pain or weariness or troubled thought But following in the train of melody To that seductive sequence of sweet sounds Tunes his attentive mind. 'Tis wonderful What power upon the passionate sould of man Resides in that low voice. The King. Well praised at least. Silisco. Welcome, fair guests, again. Pass on, I pray; The dance awaits you. The King. Presently we'll follow. Fiordeliza. Well praised indeed! Indeed I wish her joy. [Exeunt Rosalba and Fiordeliza. The King. Ruggiero, if this doctor's daughter sings so well, methinks our evening's entertainment should not be the worse for her; I pray you bring her hither. [Exit Ruggiero. My Lord of Malespina, attend your guests. We stay for a word with the Chamberlain, trusting thereby to do you some service. [Exit Silisco. Ubaldo. This Marquis, my Lord, hath gifts by nature that might be fruitful in your Majesty's service, were he well guided; but as he carries himself, he is but to your court like the streamer over yonder pavilion,— the ornament of a holiday and the plaything of the winds; and were not the intent of this day's doings to minister to your Majesty's amusement, I could call them most idle. The King. They are not for my amusement, I think, but in honour of another; and she, I hope, will regard them with more favour. My Lord, this month and more, and indeed since first your daughter came to court, it has been in my heart to speak with you on her behoof. She is, in my poor apprehension, a sweet, gentle, and of her years, truly a comely and majestic lady. Ubaldo. Your Majesty is kind; and to speak of her truly, the child is of a goodly presence and demeanour, and hath a freshness and sweet savour that I know not if her father could boast these fifty years. The King. Surely; and looking on her comeliness and youth, shall it not touch us with some careful thoughts as to the bestowing of her in marriage. I think, Sir, with so much beauty there were no little danger in the mismatching of her. Ubaldo. Most justly noted. Your Majesty hath the like discretion in affairs familiar as at the Council Board. Yet a blind instinct had supplied me, and I had already taken thought for the girl. I think your Majesty knows whom I have provided and that you could wish it no other. The King. Indeed, Sir, but I do. Count Ugo is a nobleman of surpassing worth and wealth; but his time of life borders on threescore and ten and the years that he has left for her should be but labour and sorrow. Besides, the damsel being of so great virtue and discretion, the inclination of her own fancies and affections should methinks be somewhat regarded. Ubaldo. Your Majesty's admonition is most wise; but you shall pardon me for averring that I have needed it not. To carry the damsel's inclinations with me has ever been my care, and from her cradle I have bid her beware of those green gallants and those hot bloods which take a maid to wife as parcel of their revels and lay her by like the napkin that hath wiped their beards. I bade her to know that a constancy of kindness should be found in those of riper years, and she, being of a wise and prudent spirit, hath ever assented and applied herself to the affecting of old men. The King. Hath she indeed? But either my observation is at fault or her assent extends not to Count Ugo. Ubaldo. The watchfulness of a parent, my Lord, is more than discernment; else should I not presume to say you err. The King. What! mean you that she is herself wishful to marry Count Ugo? Ubaldo. She is, my Lord; Count Ugo is her choice, Her absolute and unalterable choice; I could not turn her from him if I would. The King. Now truly this is strange! You ought to know; And yet I could have sworn her looks of love Were bent upon another—on Silisco. Ubaldo. Impossible! I warn'd her from the first That marry whom she might she could not him. His wealth was wondrous once; but wondrous waste Has scatter'd it to every wind that blows; His lands at Malespina are impledged For more than they are worth—a monstrous sum— To good Count Ugo; what he hath besides This Jew or that lays claim to. The King. There's a ship Expected now from Rhodes, that, as I learn, Brings treasure to Silisco of such price As amply shall redeem his lands and him. Ubaldo. My Lord, a large remainder of his wealth, 'Tis true, is coming swiftly o'er the sea To gild a summer's day and disappear. Lo! what he squanders ev'n on this day's feast! I crave your pardon, knowing him your friend, My gracious Lord; but were it not a sin To force my child aboard this leaky craft With every stitch of canvas madly set To court the storm? The King. To force the lady's choice Were any way a sin; but should she yield (As, if I miss not of my aim, she will) A free consent, I answer for my friend That he shall leak no longer, but repair, With such small aid as may be mine to give, The vessel of his fortunes; which perform'd, I trust a match so seemly, of a man Whom doting Nature constituted heir Of all she had, and accident upraised To eminence of station, with a maid As nobly born, and in her kind and sex As excellently gifted, should command Your kind approval. Ubaldo. Sire, the maiden's choice Is fix'd on Ugo and my faith is pledged; But should Silisco liberate his lands And settle them in trust, and should the Count Release me, and the child be wrought upon To change her purpose, then . . . . The King. I think, my friend, All these conditions you shall find fulfill'd Ere many days. Well, shall we see the dance? [Exeunt. Enter Rosalba and Fiordeliza. Fiordeliza. Let me alone, I say; I will not dance. Rosalba. Not if Ruggiero ask you? Fiordeliza. He indeed! If the Colossus came from Rhodes and ask'd me Perhaps I might. Rosalba. Come, Fiordeliza, come; I think, if truth were spoken 'tis not much You have against that knight. Fiordeliza. Not much you think; Well, be it much or little, 'tis enough; He has his faults. Rosalba. Recount me them; what are they? Fiordeliza. I'll pick you out a few: my wallet: first, He's grave; his coming puts a jest to flight As winter does the swallow. Rosalba. Something else; For this may be a merit: jests are oft Or birds of prey or birds of kind unclean. Fiordeliza. He's rude; he's stirring ever with his staff A growling great she-bear that he calls Truth. Rosalba. The rudeness is no virtue; but for love Of that she-bear, a vice that's worse might pass. Again? Fiordeliza. He's slow,—slow as a tortoise,—once He was run over by a funeral. Rosalba. He may have failings, but if these be all I would that others were as innocent. Fiordeliza. Oh, others! Say then who? Rosalba. Nay, others,—all; I wish that all mankind were innocent. Fiordeliza. You are a dear well-wisher of mankind And in a special charity you wish well To that good knight Silisco. What! do you blush? Rosalba. No; though you fain would make me. Fiordeliza. No! What's this, That with an invisible brush doth paint thee red? Well, I too can be charitable and wish Silisco were less wicked. Rosalba. Is he wicked? Fiordeliza. Is waste not wickedness? and know you not The lands of Malespina day by day Diminish in his hands? Rosalba. True, waste is sin. My mother (and no carking cares had she Nor loved the world too much nor the world's goods) In many a vigil of her last sick bed Bade me beware of spendthrifts, as of men That seeming in their youth not worse than light, Would end not so, but with the season change; For time, she said, which makes the serious soft, Turns lightness into hardness. Fiordeliza. Said she so? But I am light myself. Rosalba. Adversity Will sometimes soften what should else be hard: It may please Providence to visit you With some disaster for your good. Fiordeliza. Oh me! Pray not for that! I will be good and grave And soft without a bruise. Rosalba. Sing a soft song; If you are ever soft 'tis when you sing. Fiordeliza. I will. You mean by that, a song of love. (Sings.) Love slept upon the lone hill-side And dream'd of pleasant days When he with flowers should deck his bride And she deck him with bays. He rose like daybreak, flush'd with joy, And went his way to court; But there they took him for a toy And turn'd him into sport. He hung his head, his dreams had fled,— Not here, not here, he cried, But I shall find her in my bed Upon the lone hill-side. Enter Silisco. Silisco. My guests, I think, Are tired of dancing, and the players wait. What play shall they present? Fiordeliza. A dolorous play; A play to weep at. Silisco. Do you love to weep Or in defiance choose a tragedy? Fiordeliza. No, Sir, I choose it but to give me rest From laughing; I'm as lazy as the dog That lean'd his head against a wall to bark, And there are such a sort of men about me As take away my breath. Lo! there again! [Ruggiero crosses the back scene, leading Lisana. What comedy can show me aught like that? There is a man whose aspect, you would swear, Proclaim'd Queen Nature's warrant and commission To preach repentance to a sinful world And frighten it,—upon whose brow you read Pleasure's “hic jacet;” yet behold his life, His occupation! Never seen abroad But in his hand some rosy Magdalen That looks as hastening to repeat the sin She bloomingly repents. Oh, that is rare And I must see it to an end. Farewell! [Exit. Rosalba. Stay, Fiordeliza. Nay, then, I must follow. Silisco. Not yet,—not yet; from what you said in the dance I gather that the Court's calumnious tongues Are busy with my name; my life, I know, Has heretofore been led in such a sort As makes the wise to wonder; let them gape As wide as wisdom may; I know besides They charge me with more frailties than I own, And having of my genuine stock enough I would not you should therein err with them; My life has been, though volatile, not gross, For God bestow'd upon me at my birth A heart that fill'd the measure of its joys From its own fountains, craving nought beside. So heretofore it was; and since that eve When, as you landed in the dimpled bay From Procida, I help'd you from the boat And touch'd your hand and as the shallop rock'd Embolden'd by your fears I....pardon me, I should not make you to remember more,— But since that moment when the frolicsome waves Toss'd you towards me,—blessings on their sport! I have not felt one kindling of a thought, One working of a wish but you were in it; The rising sun that through the lattice struck Awakening me, awaken'd you within me; The darkness closing shut us up together: I saw you in the mountains, fields, and woods; Flowers breathed your breath, winds chaunted with your voice, And Nature's beauty clothed itself in yours. Then think not that my life, though idly led, Is tainted or impure or bound to sense, Or if incapable of itself to soar Unworthy to be lifted from the dust By love of what is lofty. Rosalba. No, oh! no, It was not that I heard, nor of that dye; Else had the taint remain'd upon the tongue That spake; 'twas but your prudence was impugned, Nor with unfriendly comment. Silisco. I am charged, As ofttimes it is told me, by the world, With reckless waste and wild improvidence. What call they prudence? Money which I waste I prize not; if I scatter to the winds As often as I launch my caravel To take my pleasure on the dancing waves A hundred million drops of ocean-spray, Who says I waste sea-water? yet that spray Is not more worthless in the world's account Than gold in mine. But give me what I prize, The living waters from the well of love, The hope that, bubbling from my breast, shall feed The roots of stately trees and odorous flowers And make my soul prolific,—give me that, And you shall know me for a miser. Rosalba. Oh! Be careful of what love you venture for; For in so much as love is better worth So prudence is more prizeable in love. My hand, you know, is promised. Silisco. Not by you. Rosalba. To my loved mother, on the day she died, I gave a promise solemn as a vow, That I in all things would obey my father, And specially in the choice of whom to wed. You know my father's choice. Silisco. It cannot be; He shall not link you to a living death; The world, which is his idol, would revolt From such an immolation; good men would blush And wicked men deride and all cry shame On the hard father and preposterous spouse. Rosalba. My Lord of Malespina, I am young And know not how to answer words like these; But they offend me. I have heard it said No spendthrift ever yet was generous; I hope it is not true; but bear in mind That my good father has a father's rights And I a daughter's duties; think besides Count Ugo has not injured you—nay more, 'Tis said that through a long and innocent life He never injured any. For myself, Although a coffin were my nuptial bed The promise to my sainted mother made Should not be unfulfill'd. Silisco. I stand reproved: Pardon my ill behaviour: I am rude, Unjust, ungenerous, by passion, Lady, By nature not. One boon alone I beg. I look not on you as on one betroth'd. The King befriends me, and Count Ugo's will Devoutly loyal answers to the King's In all things. At a word he yields you up. Your father is of sterner metal made: But though I rival not the Count in wealth Not many rival me, and thus the King Will want not power with him too to prevail. I therefore hold you as absolved and free. Now were you truly in your own sight so, And should I ask you then,—not for your love, But for your leave to love you, what reply Should greet me? Rosalba. Counting on my father's change You are, I fear, too sanguine. Silisco. Do you fear? That is a fear at which a thousand hopes Start into life and swarm about my heart. Recoil not nor be frighted at the fire One spark has kindled—quench it not—oh leave The beauteous element to mount and soar Though it should bear destruction on its wings; For in the vast dark hollow of this world Whate'er of earthly affluence it devours It lights the heavens that else were but half seen. You wish my suit to prosper; give it room; Grant me at least till All-Saints' Eve to bend Your father's iron will. Rosalba. That is not much; Freely I grant you that. Silisco. But plight your faith That neither force, persuasion, nor the moods Of changeful will that oft in woman's youth Betray resolve, nor yet the masking voice So plausible, of filial duty, found In duty's self-destruction, shall prevail To bind you to another till the term Now granted shall expire. Rosalba. That I am proof Against some pressures which are said to strain A woman's purpose from its constancy, I show, methinks, not doubtfully in this,— That granting you thus much I grant no more. That little which I promise, judge from this If I shall faithfully perform. Enter Bruno. Bruno. My Lord, I pray you pardon me; the Chamberlain Calls for his daughter to attend him home, As now the dews are falling. Rosalba. Say I come. I hope not with a fearless hope like yours; But yet believe me, Sir, the hope I have If wreck'd would bring a ruin on my heart It hardly could sustain. I say too much: And yet it seems too little. Fare you well. Silisco. Look! where in yonder heaven near the moon Glitters the star they call the star of love. A Spirit has his dwelling in that star Whence emanating he on earth alights Sometimes, but only in earth's happiest hours, And ranging then earth's happiest regions through He seeks, and, bee-like, rifles of their sweets The bosoms that are fullest of true love And so with rapture satiate reascends: That Spirit to that star did never take Of truer love an ampler treasure home Than you, if you should seek, would find in me. Farewell, beloved Rosalba. Rosalba. Fare you well. Judge of me gently; love me if you may. [Exit. Bruno (who had retired to the back scene, and now advances). That the dew was falling was God's truth; that the lady was sent for was man's invention. Silisco. How so? If it was thy invention, thy gift that way was never more unseasonably exercised. Bruno. Hear me ere you pronounce. I had that to speak which I think you would not that she should hear. The Maddelena hath been seen and is seen no more. Some say she was seen to sink. Silisco. Thou say'st not so? Then I sink too. But it cannot be. There has been neither storm nor mist nor aught that could bring her to danger. Bruno. She was clearly seen, and now she is lost to sight; so much is certain. Silisco. Why 'tis the sun has sunk and not the ship; Broad daylight show'd what twilight cannot. Go; Entreat my guests to pardon me awhile; The most are gone; I'll to the beach and see. [Exit. Bruno. There is a certain scum of them left which I shall know how to scatter. Had it not been for such locusts and caterpillars as these, the lands of Malespina had not now been coming by sea from Rhodes. [Exit. Enter Haggai and Sadoc meeting. Haggai. Hast thou found him? Sadoc. My Lord of Malespina? No. Haggai. They told me we should find him here. In two hours more the good ship shall be at the quay. Where is Shallum? Sadoc. He is on the watch-tower of the west gate, looking out upon the sea. No, he comes hither. Haggai. Yea, this is he,—but his hands are tossed up and his garment is rent; has aught happened to the ship? Enter Shallum. Shallum. Come ye to the beach;—the ship and the treasure, my soul is troubled for the ship and treasure. Haggai. Nay, she is coming into port. Shallum. I beheld her from the watch-tower at eleven of the clock and until six; but then she staggered and ducked like a lame bird, and in a few moments she vanished and was no more seen; so as my bowels yearn for her lest that she be lost, and the jewels and the ingots and the much treasures. But come ye to the beach. Haggai. Woe is me! my brother Shallum, I will come with thee to the beach. But go thou, Sadoc, and sue out writs against my Lord of Malespina. By Aaron's rod his body shall be bail. [Exeunt. Enter the Manager and the Three Players. 1st Player. What's ordered for to-night? Manager. Nothing's ordered; everything's forgotten; the great actors are playing their parts at court and we who are the small must shift for ourselves; yet they'll expect a play when the night comes, and it behoves us to choose what it shall be. What say ye, one and all? 2nd Player. Tell them over, as many as we are primed with. Manager. First, here is “Sorrow's Sum Total!” 1st Player. Ah! that is a sweet play; it was written by a gentleman that was very loving and melancholy and knew nothing but to sit by himself all day long weeping and making verses. But the play is too mournful for the Marquis: we'll not play that. Manager. Here is “Up with your Hearts, and Down with the Dumps.” 1st Player. The author of that was a great philosopher and wrote an excellent treatise on politics, besides sundry tales, chazas, ballads, and chansons. The Count of Arona was greatly pleased with him and said that his systems had the charm of novelty and his jests the sanction of long usage. 3rd Player. I remember him well; he tossed his heart a thought too high, and it was killed by the fall; he died of drinking, poor gentleman; and therefore we will not act his play, inasmuch as, being dead, he will not make us the customary compliment. Manager. Here is “Time's Tympany.” 1st Player. 'Tis too big. Manager. “Cupid's Wet Nurse?” 1st Player. 'Tis pretty, but not passionate. Manager. “Love's Outgoings?” 1st Player. No. Manager. “Lust's Leavings?” 1st Player. The story has a good moral, but sleeps in it as in a feather-bed. Manager. Then there is but one more,—“Woman half pleased, and Satan satisfied.” 1st Player. 'Tis easy choosing when nothing's left. That shall suffice for fault of a better. It has matter in it and an outgrowth and consequence in the story. Manager. And for the casting. . . . . Enter Bruno. Bruno. Away, you knaves and minions, get ye gone! You've eaten all, you saints of belly worship! You gilded, painted, mimicries of men, You butterflies by night and bats by day! Hence with your belly-gods! Manager. How now! how now! Bruno. How now? Dost dare to say “how now” to me! Thou urchin-snouted, trencher-pated rogue! Where are thy manners and thy moderation To say “how now” to me? My noble Lord Is lost, undone! 1st Player. My Lord of Malespina? Bruno. Yes he, thou trivial tripper up of virtue, Thou seven-times whipp'd and ne'er corrected rogue, Thou inadvertency of Nature, he. No need for peering at me o'er thy paunch; I tell thee he is beggar'd and undone; The Maddelena with the rich remains Of all he had, is in the offing wreck'd. 2nd Player. We have not done it, Sir; revile not us. Bruno. Away, you rotten-hearted, rancid knaves! It was a wind that smelling you in the port Made violent recoil. Hence, hogs, begone! Play me no plays; your trough is empty; scud. Scene II. —The Sea-shore.—Mate and Boatswain of the Maddelena. Mate. Bah! we did but what three rats would have done if it had pleased Providence. With what we got we may have absolutions for the scuttling of twenty such ships,—or of forty if the owners be Jews. Spadone makes small haste to return; surely he has had time ten times told to hide the booty. Boatswain. Hearest thou? The watch is cried at the city gates. Mate. How long are we to wait? If thou knowest the ways of the Catacombs, hie thee and fetch him off! for else Aretina will hold him half the night. Boatswain. I know them not; but with that yell in his ears which followed us when we left the ship, it can hardly be woman's dalliance that withholds him; more likely she has played him false. Mate. Then are we much in jeopardy. Lo! who comes here? By his gait and carriage it is the Marquis's fast friend my Lord of Arona. Push off, push off! Spadone must take his fate. [They betake themselves to their boat and put to sea. Enter Ruggiero. Ruggiero. Truly Silisco seems to have vanished as his ship vanished; in a moment and without a warning. Not though, like the ship, without cause that may be guessed; for assuredly there will be writs out against him when the news is known. He has conveyed himself doubtless to some safe hiding-place. What is that? a shock of seaweed or a head of hair? By Heaven, it is a man that wrestles with the surf. Courage, my friend! hold up thy head but an instant more and I am with thee. [Plunges into the surf, and brings out of it a sailor who was sinking. Why, cheer thee up? thou hast had a tustle for thy life, but thou hast it and art none the worse I think, for thy colour comes again. What! thou art doubtless a waif from the wreck of the Maddelena. But silence! I trouble thy devotions. Sailor. Next to God, Sir, I give thanks to you; for under God it is to you that I owe my life. Strong swimming stood me in stead for two long hours, but then my strength was nigh spent and the surf should have mastered me but for your help. I thank God for my life, and I thank God that all men are not the merciless villains that some are; for the villainy that put me in this peril might have made me think mankind given over to the Devil, but for the charity that plucked me out of it. Ruggiero. Villainy! Why, was it not the elements? Sailor. The elements were guiltless; the wreck was a wreck of man's making and of the Devil's setting on; and the captain, the mate, and the boatswain were the instruments; they scuttled the ship and made off in a boat with the treasure. Ruggiero. Ay, verily did they? And I saw but now two men that fled at my approach as though the cry of blood were behind and betook them to their boat. Sailor. They should be three. But had they peaked beavers such as are worn at Rhodes? Ruggiero. They had, and doubtless they are full in flight with their booty. Now if, as thou say'st, thou owest thy peril to them and thy life to me, commit thyself with me to the craft that is tethered in yonder cove and we will give chase to them. Sailor. I am yours, Sir, for any service you shall command, and you could not put me to one more welcome. What course did they steer? Ruggiero. As if making for the coast of Calabria. We shall have them in sight and to leeward round yonder point. Scene III. —The Catacombs.—Spadone and Aretina. Spadone. Silence! I did not come to thee for shrift. Say one or fifty sent to feed the sharks, What matters it? Of such a miscreant tribe Each by the other would have done the like But that they lack'd the courage and the scope To rise above some petty piracy. Truly to see the gallant ship go down Went to my heart—she was a goodly craft! But for the crew, I'd drown them twice a-day And think no pity on't, more than to drown A litter of blind puppies. Fare thee well! Remember that to him who brings thee this [Showing a ring. Thou shalt disclose the treasure—to none else. And thou shalt send me tidings, too, by him Of what is said in Sicily. Farewell. [Exit. Aretina. O monstrous crime! Ruthless, remorseless wretch! And so besotted as to think my love Would hold through all! A gurgling sobbing sound Is in my ears,—a booming overhead! My blood runs cold. Oh! I shall faint! and here! And should the light go out . . . . I hear a step . . . (Enter Silisco.) Who's there! Who are you? [Utters a sharp cry. Silisco. Nay, but who art thou? I swear 'tis Aretina—cold as stone! What dost thou here? nay, courage—come, look up; A friendly arm is round thee—know'st not me? Aretina. Oh yes, my Lord, I know you,—sent by Heaven— For I have that to tell you . . . . Spadone (who had re-entered unobserved and stabs her from behind). Which thy throat Shall utter through a bloody new-made mouth. [Aretina shrieks and flies. And now, my Lord, for you! Silisco. A woman's blood, Dastard! is all that thou shalt shed to-day. [They fight. Spadone falls. Slain is he? No, I think not—but he swoons. Where's that unhappy girl? Fled forth the caves? Well doth this caitiff merit to be left To meet his fate; but should he wake to life And find himself in darkness left to die Unshriven and unassoil'd! Most horrible! Gerbetto's house is on the beach hard by; I'll take him there: the worthy doctor's skill May call him from his trance, and he may thus Repent and live or be absolv'd and die. ACT III. Scene I. —Gardens of Ubaldo's Palace. —Rosalba and Fiordeliza. Fiordeliza. Rosalba,—nay, Rosalba. Rosalba. Am I not patient? Fiordeliza. Well, I think you are: but I would have you cheerful; look at me; has not my lover vanished too? Rosalba. True, Fiordeliza; sorrow is wont to be vilely selfish and I am forgetting your trouble in mine own. Yet if I were not driven to marry another, methinks I also could be cheerful. Fiordeliza. I will pity you for the driving; but you shall not pity me for the vanishing. I tell you that that sunshine and these flowers are more to me than love. They make me happy. Rosalba. If that were so, your happiness should be but the happiness of a butterfly, and should last but a summer's season. I think it is not so; but be it or be it not, you are so bright a thing in mine eyes that I cannot desire you to be other than you are. Fiordeliza. I am not a butterfly. But I wish in my heart that we were like the birds, which are in love only once a year. I will sing you a song and shall not that do you good? (Sings.) Oh had I the wings of a dove Soon would I fly away And never more think of my love Or not for a year and a day: If I had the wings of a dove. I would press the air to my breast, I would love the changeful sky, In the murmuring leaves I would set up my rest And bid the world good-bye: If I had the wings of a dove. Rosalba. It is a new song I think, but in an old sense, and one that will live as long as the world lives, unless the world should live to be better than it is. Fiordeliza. Yes, or than it ever has been since the birds sang to Adam in the golden prime. They sang to him out of the tree of life, and knew better than to build their nests in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; and though death comes to them, it comes unknown, and though love leaves them, they sigh not. Rosalba. Is yon my father? Alas! I fear the very sight of him now. Fiordeliza. Were I a nursing mother I should fear it, lest it should sour my milk. Rosalba. He is always in the same story—that Silisco never will be seen again and Count Ugo cannot wait. Fiordeliza. Well, as to the story, there is this truth in it—that the rich Silisco will not be seen, and that Ugo will never again be as young as he is now. Indeed your father may have some cause to fear lest his purpose to marry be crossed by that hasty humour which happens to men at his time of life, of going to the grave at one jump. Rosalba. Fie! Fiordeliza; it makes me sad, not merry, to hear you talk so lightly. Count Ugo, though he has not, nor has had, the gifts and faculties which you set store by, was ever a just, courteous, and bountiful man, of good life and conversation, with a gentle and generous heart, and peradventure as much understanding as innocence has occasion for. Fiordeliza. Oh! I grant him that; but nevertheless the good old golden pippin is ripe and may drop while the gardener is getting the ladder. There is the gardener,—and who besides? Gerbetto, the doctor, I think. They are deep in council, and are going to take another turn; so let me sing another song the while. (Sings). The last year's leaf, its time is brief Upon the beechen spray; The green bud springs, the young bird sings Old leaf, make room for May: Begone, fly away; Make room for May. Oh green bud, smile on me awhile, Oh young bird, let me stay:— What joy have we, old leaf, in thee? Make room, make room for May: Begone, fly away, Make room for May. Enter Ubaldo and Gerbetto. Ubaldo. I bring you, daughter, a kind friend and a skilful physician, who can cure, I think, more maladies than are mentioned in Hippocrates or Galen; and he would have a few words with you,—a few words with you, good lady, a few. Rosalba. Master Gerbetto is a good friend to me and ever welcome, and though I have given him but little opportunity for the exercise of his art, yet I have many times found comfort in his kindness. Gerbetto. Indeed, sweet lady, I would fain be comfortable to you if I might. Fiordeliza. Well, if you may not, at least show us a less discomfortable countenance; for with that you have on now you look more like adversity itself than a consolation in adversity. Ubaldo. He brings, though not a comfort, yet a cure, A cure for blindness and besotted dreams, A cure for feminine credulity. This swain, enamour'd as he seem'd of you, Was all the while enamour'd of another; And by that guilty passion's power impell'd To deeper guilt, he stain'd his hands in blood, And stands accountant for a rival's death. Fiordeliza. Nay, sweet Rosalba, keep your courage yet; This cannot be believed. Reach her yon seat. Silisco never was impeach'd before Of dissolute courses. Rosalba. And he said himself His life, or ever it had found its law From love and me, had still been pure. Ubaldo. Oh dupe! He told you, he! No doubt of it he did; An unthrift was a liar from all time; Never was debtor that was not deceiver. Hold up thy head, poor child; poor monkey, nay, 'Tis a brief anguish that discards the vile, The false, the faithless. Doctor, tell your tale. Gerbetto. 'Tis a sad task, that tale to tell, for me; But I am bound to speak. Two months ago,— That day it was the marquis disappear'd— Coming from vespers, in my house I found A wounded man, swooning from loss of blood. With sedulous care and what small skill is mine I tended him, though deeming from the first His hurt was mortal. Slowly day by day He languish'd and declined, till yesternight, Knowing his hour was come, he bade me hear What brought him to that pass; which till that hour, Wherefore I know not, he was loth to tell. He said that in the caverns near the beach, Not far from my abode, the self-same night That I first found him wounded on the floor, A damsel that affianced was to him By him was caught in passages of love With a young lordling of the court; they fought; He fell; and instantaneously bereft Of sense, he knew no more, nor by what means He reach'd my house. I ask'd him, did he know Who slew him; he replied, he knew him well, The Lord of Malespina; at that word He bounded from his bed, fell back, and died. Rosalba. Alas! alas! Ubaldo. Here is a terrible tale! And this is he that would have wed my child! I thank him that he puts me forth his foot And shows the cleft on't; truly, yes, I thank him. Now, daughter, I beseech you, prate no more Of promises and questions and delays. What day you please next week! 'Tis yours to choose. Rosalba. Oh, father, father, give me time to think; My brain is weak; I cannot understand What's said to me nor what I say myself. Ere long this dimness will be clear'd away And I shall know my course; but, father, now The waters have gone over me. Ubaldo. Nay, nay, So long as thou'rt unsettled, mutinous thoughts Will vex thy heart; I know the ways of women; But when what should be must, contentment comes; Compassion goes to work the shortest way; Despatch is mercy: yet yourself shall choose; Say Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, which you will; Thursday or—no, not Friday—at your pleasure Thursday or Saturday. Go, go your ways; Order whate'er shall please you; a brave day We'll make on't; get you gone. Good cause had he To fly the Court! The truculent villain! Ho! Scene II. —A Farmstead on the Lands of Malespina, in the Neighbourhood of the Castle. Enter Silisco and Ruggiero. Ruggiero. We chased them that night and the next day, gaining on them by little and little; but as evening fell, there came into the horizon a cloud no bigger than your hand, and in an instant the storm swooped upon them like a bird of prey and they went to destruction before our eyes, thief and booty together. Silisco. Best friend and boldest, how fared you I pray? Ruggiero. The storm spared us, but we were sorely tormented by hunger and thirst that night; and when we landed next morning at Vetri in Calabria, my strength was clean spent and a fever was upon me that laid me low for many a day. When that left me, I found my way back with all speed, and learning from Monna the direction of your flight, I sped hither. Such is my history. Silisco. Of mine remains But little to recount. Spadone, or, If he was dead, Spadone's corpse, I left In old Gerbetto's cottage on the beach; Nor waiting his return (for he was forth), Back to the Catacombs I sped, and search'd Each cranny, but could nowhere find my friend, The luckless Aretina. In the caves I dwelt by day; the night I chiefly spent In my own gardens. Ruggiero. In your gardens? Silisco. Yes; Behind the statue of Proserpina There is a cavern fringed with pensile plants, By which, well-known to me in boyhood, opes A passage to the Catacombs; through this, When first it reached me that the writs were out I, like a land-crab, into earth had dropp'd, And afterwards through this I issued thence When darkness and the owls possess'd the world. Ere long, impatient of my dreary life, I meditated flight; and strange you'll deem The choice I made of whither to betake me; But having not since childhood seen my lands A humour seized me to revisit them; And seeing I was here as little known As elsewhere I could be, and peradventure Should be less look'd for, hither did I come. I found Count Ugo's people in possession, The sometime mortgagee, the owner now. Ruggiero. Why hither? it can bring you little joy To look upon the lands that you have lost. Silisco. To look upon the days that I have lost, Ruggiero, brings me less; and here I thought To get behind them; for my childhood here Lies round me. But it may not be. By Heavens! That very childhood bitterly upbraids The manhood vain that did but travesty, With empty and unseasonable mirth, Its joys and lightness. From each brake and bower Where thoughtless sports had lawful time and place The manly child rebukes the childish man; And more reproof and bitterer do I read In many a peasant's face whose leaden looks My host the farmer construes to my shame. Injustice, rural tyranny, more dark Than that of courts, have laid their brutal hands On those that claim'd my tendance; want and vice And injury and outrage fill'd my lands, Whilst I, who saw it not, my substance threw To feed the fraudulent and tempt the weak. Ruggiero, with what glittering words soe'er We smear the selfishness of waste, and count Our careless tossings bounties, this is sure, Man sinks not by a more unmanly vice Than is that vice of prodigality— Man finds not more dishonour than in debt. Ruggiero. Farewell my function! I perceive that now You need no more a monitor. To me, Who, when the past was present, sigh'd to see it, The present brings its joy; one work is wrought; Adversity hath borne its best of fruits; And, issuing from this gorge, the tract you tread, Though it be ne'er so beggarly and bare, Shall lie, I augur, in the sunshine. Silisco. No; Not in the sunshine; that may never be; Upon my path the sun shall shine no more. It is not poverty will darken it— In many another point I err'd, but not In deeming wealth to me was little worth; Nor self-reproach—for this, though sharp, will work Its own purgation; nor the world's contempt, Which with a light and friendly disregard I soon could conquer. But one hope there was That in the darkness and the frosty air Burnt brighter still and brighter, which is now Set, not to rise again. In this I own Needful severity; for this apart My joyfulness of nature had escaped The hands of justice and all worldly ills Had left me unchastised. Ruggiero. Rosalba false! Silisco. No, say not so—she means not to be false; No—falseness could no more have place in her Than could the cankerworm in Paradise. She promised, it is true, till All-Saints' Eve To hold herself in freedom unbetroth'd; 'Tis likewise true, or publicly proclaim'd, Count Ugo is to marry her to-morrow. But doubtless she has deem'd herself released By my desertion. Since that fatal night She knows of me no more than that I vanish'd; For how could I, a beggar, plead to her, An heiress, her past promise? With what aim? Since should she wait the term, the issue still Must be obedience to her sire's behest; And what can now move him? Ruggiero. I know not what; But what we know not of may haply be: And this I know,—what rules the true of heart Is plighted faith, not circumstance. To-morrow? I think it may be done—Ronzino's legs Will carry me if legs of mortal steed Can span the distance in the time—and so My presence and my protest shall precede This woeful wedding: yes, ere noon to-morrow Before Rosalba face to face I'll stand, And, be it at the altar's foot, oppose Her prior promise to her marriage vow. Leandro, ho! my horse. Silisco. At least there's truth In friendship. But be gentle to Rosalba. Scene III. —A Street in Palermo. —A Festal Procession is seen issuing from the Church in the distance and advancing. Enter a Chorus of Maidens with baskets of flowers, followed by a Chorus of Youths, and Tribolo, the King's Fool. Chorus of Maidens. Who shall lack a lover? Lo! She held a hundred in her chains; They must break them now and go Where new loves shall pay their pains; But who shall hail Their cast-off faces pale? Who yield her charms To their dejected eyes and nerveless arms? Not I, nor I, Nor none of us; And should they try, We'd pelt them thus. [Flinging flowers at the other chorus. Tribolo. Well said, Virgins! Look at me if you would see a colour;—and there's an arm for you! “Let me alone, villain, I cannot draw my breath,” said the she-rhinoceros when I put it round her waist. But is there no answer? Chorus of Youths. We bent the knee before her With a worship nigh to sin, Predestined to adore her Without a hope to win: But having known the dear delight Of living in her sunny sight, 'Twere vain That we should strain Against the pressure of that golden chain; For we are prisoners in Despair's despite: And as for trying what our eyes could do Or what our arms, with you, We could not, scornful maidens, if we might. Tribolo. Hapless Bachelors! But I like you well; for though you counterfeit a love-sickness, yet you are clad in all the colours of the rainbow, and you sing like peacocks. Come along! You must perform this at the Palace. Come, musical maidens and men of many colours. Sing in time and you shall be rewarded in eternity,—not to mention a puncheon of strong ale which stands abroach for you at the buttery. [Exeunt. Enter Ruggiero with an Innkeeper. Ruggiero. Brought fairly to the ground! I prithee give the poor beast a can of wine, and when his courage shall come back take him to the stable of the Palazzo Arona; do thy best for him and take this for thy pains. [Exit Innkeeper. Poor Ronzino! thou sufferest for the sins of others. What festal troop is this? Ha! my mind misgives me! [The Procession crosses the stage; two Citizens detach themselves from it and stand beside Ruggiero. 1st Citizen. Enough of this! I'll follow no further. Foh! 'Tis a filthy crowd! 2nd Citizen. The sun is hot, and the garlick, which yesterday was like a flower of the field, is to-day the least of a little unsavoury. At night there is to be a masked ball at the palace in honour of the wedding. 1st Citizen. If I were a nobleman and bidden, I would not dance at it. 2nd Citizen. Why so? 1st Citizen. It is such a wedding as no man that dances with consideration would dance at. 2nd Citizen. Wherefore? It is magnificently managed and no cost spared. 1st Citizen. It is a wicked wedding: the bride is the sweetest incomparable lady that ever the sun shined upon, and the bridegroom— 2nd Citizen. Well? 1st Citizen. Is a pink-headed, white-haired old gentleman; very corpulent; with one foot in the grave and the other in a velvet shoe. Did you mark him as he stood at the altar, leaning upon his staff? He was three minutes groping in his pouch for the ring, and at last he fished up—what? a pair of spectacles! 2nd Citizen. He is a simple-hearted, kindly gentleman —meek and mild—but as you say, very old and not strong in the legs. Let us to the royal gardens and make sure of places to see the fireworks. Ruggiero. What marriage is it that you speak of, friends? Count Ugo's? 1st Citizen. Yes. Ruggiero. And did ye say the King Gives a mask'd ball to-night? 2nd Citizen. Sir, so we hear. [Exeunt Citizens. Ruggiero. Too late—too late! Yet shall the truth be heard! Though what is irremediable be done, Let what is just be spoken. To that ball Shall come a dreary and unwelcome guest. Scene IV. —An Antechamber with folding doors, opening upon a Ball-Room in the Royal Palace at Palermo. —The King, masked as a Knight of St. John, and Lisana, as a Minstrel. The King. Young minstrel, had thy ditty been less sweet I should have bid thee sing me one less sad, But thou hast so subdued me to thy strain I crave another like it. Lisana. Sooth, my Lord, It is but such that I can sing; I'm young, Untaught, and have but a few natural notes: I sing but as the birds do, from my heart. The King. Well, sing from that again. Thy voice awakes A tenderness that might be troublesome And shame to show itself by day; but tears That come at twilight like a summer dew May trickle unrestrain'd; sing once again. Lisana. (sings). The morning broke and Spring was there, And lusty Summer near her birth; The birds awoke and waked the air, The flowers awoke and waked the earth. Up! quoth he, what joy for me On dewy plain, in budding brake! A sweet bird sings on every tree, And flowers are sweeter for my sake. Lightly o'er the plain he stept, Lightly brush'd he through the wood, And snared a little bird that slept And had not waken'd when she should. Lightly through the wood he brush'd, Lightly stept he o'er the plain, And yet—a little flower was crush'd That never raised its head again. The King. That voice had won me were I blind; that face, Though I were deaf, had spoken to my heart! I am ashamed to say what love is mine For thee, and of what temper. Jesu Mary! That I, a King, God help me! should so waste The night, the dawn, the noon, the dewy eve In this sweet serious idleness of love. The masquers thicken, and such songs as these Are not for every ear. See! through this door There is a private chamber. Come with me. [Exeunt the King and Lisana. Enter Ruggiero, masked as Conscience, with a lamp and scourge. Ruggiero. Surely I know that voice! Lisana's, if I err not. And that Knight of St. John was the King. Poor girl! she is in the toils, and they glisten in her eyes like a cobweb dew-bespangled. A word of warning in her father's ear were not ill bestowed, and doubtless he will be here anon. Enter divers Maskers, passing through to the Ball-Room, and others passing out. 1st Mask. Marco, I think? Yes, I know you by the wave of your feather. What, have you danced? 2nd Mask. Ay; but methinks these festivities are somewhat sadly carried. Seest thou the bride yonder? By my faith she stands more like a marble statue in a mist than a bride of flesh and blood. There—have you seen her, Sir? (to Ruggiero). Ah, now she slinks behind the crowd. Ruggiero. In truth a pitiable spectacle! I marvel, Sir, what pleasure age can take So airily to deck its dim decline. A chaplet of forced flowers on winter's brow Seems not less inharmonious to me Than the untimely snow on the green leaf. 2nd Mask. Why, Sir, it is a common error of age to think that it can get back the enjoyment of youth by getting what youth only can enjoy. 1st Mask. Nay, but this was a match of Ubaldo's making, not of Ugo's. We are here to dance; so pass on, I pray you. [All pass into the ball-room except Ruggiero and one Mask. Ruggiero. Gerbetto, no? Gerbetto. The same, Sir; and can I mistake the voice of the Count of Arona? Ruggiero. Make me not known, Gerbetto; but when we pass in, do thy endeavour to draw the Countess out of the crowd to where I shall stand apart. Know you, Gerbetto, that your daughter hath secret conference with the King? Gerbetto. You say not so, my Lord? Ruggiero. I do; and though the maiden be as modest as the rosebud's inmost leaf, yet I like not the sun and the south-west wind to play with her. Gerbetto. You are right, my Lord; and I shall beseech you to give me your counsel. But lo! the crowd divides and if we take the occasion . . . . Ruggiero. Pass in, I pray. Scene V. —The Ball-Room, with various groups of Masks. —In front Ugo and Rosalba as bridegroom and bride, with Ubaldo and Fiordeliza. After a while Gerbetto joins them, with Ruggiero, who remains a little apart. Tribolo the King's Fool appears in his usual habit. Ubaldo. More lights, I tell you! If a canary bird were here she would hardly sing. Strike up, musicians! We suffer more in the tuning of your fiddles than the music's worth. If the King be taken up into heaven, 'tis well; but as we see him neither here nor there, 'tis no wonder if our guests shall not disport themselves as merrily as they are wont. Ugo. If an old man can do aught to make them merry, I would fain be assisting. Ubaldo. Old! why the day makes us all young. Fiordeliza. If your good Lordship would assist me, I pray you to find me a discreet and nimble gentleman to dance with. Ugo. I will, sweet Lady. Rosalba. My friend, my Fiordeliza, leave me not. Fiordeliza. Come hither, Fool. How is it that thou comest to the King's masked ball without a mask? Tribolo. Please your sweet Ladyship, my sister told me the solemnity was of that nature that I should show it my countenance and not my mask. Fiordeliza. Thy sister? I knew not thou hadst a sister. Who is she? Tribolo. The world calls her Wisdom. The wisdom of the world, my Lady, was ever born-sister to a fool. Fiordeliza. The fool were no fool that should hold that faith. Tribolo. Then there is my mask and the fool is no fool for the occasion. Gerbetto. (to Ruggiero in the side scene). She says she must know who you are before she shall speak with you apart. Ruggiero. Then be it openly and not apart. Fiordeliza. Fool, thou art melancholy. Tribolo. No wonder, Lady, if you consider my dreams last night. Fiordeliza. What didst thou dream? Tribolo. I dreamt I was a tailor going to be married, and that I went to church sitting cross-legged a-top of a hearse and stitching at my shroud. Fiordeliza. Was that all? Tribolo. No, I dreamt that I was a thousand miles out at sea, sitting astride of an empty cask, and a beauteous sea-nymph bobbing before me; but I could not come at her. Ubaldo. The King, doubtless, hath his own amusements and we will wait no longer. Ho! gallants, gallants, match ye for the dance! strike up, musicians! Serve a bumper round. Ho! gallants, follow me; this way, this way. Ruggiero. (advancing) Pass ye no further till my voice be heard. Ubaldo. What voice is that? a merry mask I trow; Well, speak; I like the humour of thy mask, Though it be dismal; whom dost thou present? Ruggiero. Sirs, I am Conscience; with this lamp I search The hearts of sinners, with this scourge chastise; Men feast, men dance, men revel,—but I come; The shouts of jollity and riot rise, But what though jollity and riot shout, My knock is heard and let me in they must; For wheresoever Evil enters, there I follow with my lamp, and Evil thus Is palpable, or by his substance seen Or by his shadow; then my lamp I lift As now I lift it—yea, I lift my lamp And lift my scourge—for therefore am I here: Musicians, cease; ye dancers, cease to dance, Trampling ye know not what beneath your feet; What ye with noise and dancing celebrate Are vows by prior vows made perfidy— A heartless, faithless show of plighted faith. Ubaldo. What masking call ye this? A mask indeed That masks a railer and a villain. Ho! Tear off this caitiff's mask—tear off his mask. Gerbetto. (supporting Rosalba) Sirs, she wants air—I pray you stand aside. Fiordeliza. Cheerly, my sweet Rosalba! Villain! Ugo. Run, Fetch that elixir . . . . Ubaldo. Tear me off his mask, Tear off the villain's mask. Ruggiero. Ye shall not need. [Unmasking. Fiordeliza. Ruggiero! 1st Mask. What! the Count? 2nd Mask. 'Tis he indeed! 3rd Mask. As strangely found as lost! 4th Mask. Most wonderful! Ugo. Who is it, Sirs? who is it? for mine eyes . . . . Ubaldo. I would that mine were dimmer than they are. My Lord, or e'er you ask me to unsay The name I gave you in your mask, say you Wherefore you trouble thus our marriage feast. Ruggiero. Say what you please and unsay what you will. Silisco loved your daughter; she loved him And pledged her faith that this side All-Saints' Eve She would not wed another. I demand Why walks she here a bride? Ubaldo. This outrage grows! Who says she loved? Rosalba. Father, I did, I did. Ubaldo. Or pledged her faith? Rosalba. I did, but he was false. Fiordeliza. Gerbetto knows it—and he slew the espoused Of her with whom he traffick'd. Gerbetto. Sir, 'tis true; He slew him in the caverns. Ruggiero. Oh, sad chance! Disastrous error! Was it this betray'd The maiden's faith! Why then shall pity plead Against all anger. Whom he slew I know,— A wretch who, for the plunder of his ship, Sent to the bottom her and all her crew, By name Spadone; in the Catacombs, Silisco, hiding from his creditors, Met—innocently met, by accident— Spadone's paramour; by him assail'd, He, certes, slew him. Ubaldo. At the point of death Spadone said . . . . Ruggiero. What like enough he thought; For with a hundred murders did he reek And foulest thoughts were uppermost. But lo! If any here shall say Silisco's soul Was not as pure as infant's at the breast, True as confessing Saint's, there is my glove— I'll prove upon his body that he lies. Three Knights come forward. 1st Knight. There be three here will take this quarrel up Upon the bride's behalf. Rosalba. Oh, not on mine! My cause is bad—I brake my promise—oh! Silisco, ever, evermore beloved! Forgive me! oh forgive me! I was false, And thou wert faithfuller than the constant fire That burns the centre! Ubaldo. Daughter! art thou mad? Fiordeliza. She faints, she falls. Gerbetto. Make room—to the air—to the air! [Rosalba is taken out by Gerbetto and Fiordeliza. Ubaldo. See, Sir, your mischief prospers. But the King Shall know of this, and instantly. My friends, Ye see how this, which should have been a feast, By this man's meddling insolence is marr'd. This shall the King redress; and some time hence We'll have our pastime; for this present, Sirs, Your further aid I ask not. Fare you well! [Exit. Ugo. Before you go, Sirs, pray you hear me speak; For I am sorely troubled, yea, my heart Is full of grief: I knew not, Sirs, till now Of this sweet lady's love, nor of her pledge Given, as this Lord avouches, to his friend, That worthy Knight, my Lord of Malespina: Sirs, had I known it, not for worlds and worlds Would I have done her that discourtesy To force myself upon her to her wrong: Sirs what I can I will for her relief; I call you all to witness, I renounce All rights from this day's injury derived; I'll never more approach her. Ruggiero. Noble Sir, Your pardon if I wrong'd you. Ugo. Nay, not so; The sorrows of this day are born of sin; A secret sin, whereof to cleanse my soul I hasten now. I pray you help me hence. Forth on a perilous pilgrimage I go, Sorely to suffer for my sore offence. Ruggiero. Count, think not I accuse you . . . Ugo. No, Sir, no; My sin is other than against this maid, Whom, verily, I married for her good, Her sire protesting 'twas her will—no less For her own good than that exceeding love I bore her and shall ever bear—and now There's nothing I can suffer that my soul Shall not rejoice to suffer, even to death, If haply so appeasing God, He shower A blessing on that lady and her love. [Exit, followed by all except Ruggiero. Ruggiero. A gallant and magnanimous old man! Much injury have I done him, God forgive me! In thinking slightly of his slender wit By greatness of his heart so glorified. Till now I knew not he had utterance; But generous sorrows and high purposes Make the dumb speak. Ye orators, note that, That in the workshop of your head weave words. Enter Gerbetto. Gerbetto. Strange day is this! My Lord, the aged Count Prepares, in sackcloth clad, to issue forth The city gates, afoot and unattended, To seek the Holy Sepulchre. A vow Made this day three years, when his former wife Lay sick to death, did bind him, as he says, Within three years in such wise to perform This pilgrimage, the disregard whereof He deems to be the cause of this day's griefs; And therefore, ere the stroke of twelve foreclose Upon his pledge, he needs will take his way Alone, on foot, toward Jerusalem. Ruggiero. A brave resolve! but which to execute His body is unequal. Ere he reach A three days' journey, he shall fall by the way; He must be follow'd though he know it not, And tended at his need. Wilt thou do this? Gerbetto. I will, my Lord; nor shall it hold me long; I know the nature of his maladies; Scarce for one week can they sustain the toil Of journeying afoot. But, good my Lord, I pray you, whether it be days or months, Be careful, in my absence, of my child; Fulfil her father's duties and defeat The King's designs if evil. Ruggiero. Ah, the King! I know that dangerous softness of the King And how it works in issue. Lovingly, Like a tame tiger, that long licks the hand Till he draw blood, then maddens, doth he now Fondle Lisana. He shall not draw blood Whilst blood of mine is living in my veins. ACT IV. Scene I. —The Palace at Palermo. —Ubaldo and the Chief Justiciary. Ubaldo. This passion, Sir, for this doctor's daughter which is lost, is, to speak privately, a kind of madness in the King; and it is a madness which many moons have shined upon; it is now nigh upon six since the maiden was seen last, being, I think, the night of my daughter's marriage, when Gerbetto, her father, followed in Count Ugo's wake to Jerusalem. As for these charges against the Count of Arona touching matters of accompt and malversations, they are but colourable; the true ground of the proceedings is a species of jealousy and amorous rage against the Count, who, it is certain, for fault of some employment that should better commend his virtue and discretion, did very strangely carry off this doctor's daughter and holds her somewhere in concealment. The Chief Justiciary. The King, as you say, my Lord, speaking privately, must be clean lunatic to make this ado about a doctor's daughter; seeing that he might disport himself at his pleasure with a hundred doctors' daughters, not to say a hundred ladies of greater estimation and nobility. Nevertheless, the lunacy of a King must be respected, and I do continually what in me lies to discover where the wench is concealed, and to take the person of the Count. Ubaldo. Truly the Count shall be no loss at the Council Board; for his words went for more than they were worth with the King, and in matters of statecraft he was but a pedant. I have my own conceit of this matter, which squares not with the King's; and notwithstanding the Count's exorbitancy in the carrying off of a wench, I deem that he is more likely to be found in an old track than in a new one. I would have you set a watch upon the Lady Fiordeliza; and where the hen-bird hath her nest you may look for the cock to come. The Chief Justiciary. I will take your Lordship's guidance. Know you where the Lady Fiordeliza may be met with? Ubaldo. She has lately gone to sojourn for a season with my daughter, who lives like a Nun since her marriage, choosing for her nunnery the Castle of Malespina, which fell to Count Ugo in satisfaction of the debt due to him from the former Lord of it, that castaway, Silisco. There, I think, she will be found, and he there-abouts. The Chief Justiciary. There shall he be sought. If your good Lordship will bring me to the King, I will crave his signature to these warrants. Scene II. —The Castle of Malespina. —Rosalba and Fiordeliza. Fiordeliza. Does nothing ever happen in this castle? I have been gazing up the great avenue for an hour and more, trying to think that there was a Knight Errant pricking forward at the further end; but I saw only two rabbits that crossed the road in a leisurely manner on their affairs, and a squirrel which, for want of something to do, jumped from one tree and flung itself into the arms of another over the way. Look at Lion; he sleeps away his second childhood at the gate, and if you hear a grunt, 'tis that he dreams of his younger days, when once upon a time he saw a stranger and barked. For myself, my only companion is the ancient steward, and his only topic is the wholesomeness of the air; a commendation which I dare not deny, inasmuch as all the persons I have seen beside himself, are ten serving men whose joint ages are nine hundred and thirty-six. Rosalba. I wish the castle could be made more cheerful for you; but how can it, the present Lord of it being so far away on so perilous an enterprise, and the late Lord . . . . Oh Fiordeliza! are the imaginations of my heart very wicked when they wander after him? Fiordeliza. You know best; how should I take the measure of their wickedness? Rosalba. It is doubt and fear which keep them so busy; if I did but know more about him I should think less. Fiordeliza. Something, then, you do know? Rosalba. Shall I tell you? Yes. In a summer-house which was once a temple—you can see the corner of it yonder in the wood on the other side of the brook—is a statue of Silisco, made when he was a boy. A statue of Antinoüs stands opposite to it, and Silisco's is the more beautiful of the two. On the evening after my arrival, as I was looking upon it, I descried in the fold where the hand joins the drapery, a thread of silk, fastened to which was this scroll. Fiordeliza. Oh, let me see it. Rosalba. No, Fiordeliza, I cannot give it you: see, you will tear it. Fiordeliza. (reading). “Here my footsteps must not be After this my infancy. They shall wander far and wide, By pleasure tempted first and tried; Then by passion, which with wings Shall lift them where the skylark sings; Anguish and repentance next Back shall drive them sore perplex'd. Whither then? A grateful mind A grateful work shall seek and find; When heroic ardour reigns In an old man's shrivell'd veins, Youthful veins were shamed indeed If they bled not where his bleed.” He has been here then. Rosalba. From the farmer on the demesne I learn, that from about the time of Silisco's disappearance from Palermo, there lodged at the farm a person of a light, lofty, and graceful appearance, courteous and winning of demeanour, who answers to Silisco in everything, except that he was not gay, but pensive and retiring. He went hence, no one knows whither, on the day of my arrival. Fiordeliza. I wish he would come back; is there no hope of him? Rosalba. None, Fiordeliza, none. Fiordeliza. Why then I return to my former aspiration and I wish for any Knight Errant that it may please Providence to send us. Rosalba. You said once that flowers and sunshine were enough for you. Fiordeliza. While the sun is hot and the flowers are happy; but look at yonder sunflower on one side the arch, how it hangs its head? and at the hollyhock leaning over from the other; they are heart-broken about the last carnation, poor thing! for it died yesterday; this gusty wind, which is getting up, is to sing its dirge. Lo! See! There is a Knight Errant! Rosalba. Where? Fiordeliza. Behind that mountain-ash; when the wind waves it you'll see him;—there—and I protest I believe he is very handsome. He seems as if he did not know which way to go. Send some one . . . . . Rosalba. I see no Knight Errant. Fiordeliza. How blind you are! there—there. Rosalba. That, my dear? That is the scarecrow which I told Girolamo to put there yesterday to keep the blackbirds from the gourds. Fiordeliza. How can you be so unkind, Rosalba! Everybody deceives me and I know the scarecrow was put there on purpose— Rosalba. Nay, you deceived yourself now and I cannot think that you have ever been deceived by another. I should not quarrel with you for seeing that which is not, if you would but believe in that which is; for, trust me, it is when we are most faithless that we are most deceived. Believe in Ruggiero, and you will have present peace and a reward to come. To me experience has given a sharp schooling against distrust, and I will never again let the world's outcry and the masking of circumstance get the better of a faithful instinct. Fiordeliza. I never did so yet; and when the world and circumstance commended Ruggiero for a young nobleman of excellent discretion and infinite sobriety, my faithful instinct told me, there is something wicked here. Morn that look'st so grim and grey, Tell me truly, tell me truly, What wilt thou be ere mid-day? Who can say, who can say? Flaunting forth in garments gay, Darting beams unruly, Darting beams unruly. No, no; when he ran off with Lisana, it was but a clenching and confirming. Rosalba. They disappeared together; whether he took her away I know not; but if he did, it was for no evil purpose. Fiordeliza. Oh no, none: doubtless he withdrew with her to the desert for a season of fasting and humiliation. Enter Mariana. Mariana. Please you, my Lady, the Falconer sends his duty and Alathiella has not touched her food for three days; he is fearful she will die, and he says the Count gave a hundred crowns for her. Rosalba. Poor bird! she doted on her master and has never held up her head since she missed him; I fear she will die, like some of her betters, of a broken heart. Mariana. He says he knows but of one thing to do with her, which is to take her to the Conjurer at the Farm. Fiordeliza. The Conjurer? who is he? Mariana. Have you not heard of him, my Lady? 'Tis the strangest story! Fiordeliza. If there be anything strange left us here below, I prithee tell of it; for I thought that everday droppings had worn the world as smooth as a wash-ball. How came a Conjurer to the Farm? Mariana. I will tell you, my Lady. It was the very night of the going off of the wart on my thumb and the day after the worm in Maria's nose put out horns, Dame Agata, being in her first sleep, heard a great rushing of wings; and so says she to her husband,—“Osporco, either the Devil is hereabouts or there's a cockchafer;” and then there came a knock; so, says she, “Wait to see if they knock again, and if they do, put your blunderbuss out at the window and ask if there's anything wanted.” Well, the knock came a second time, and then a third; and Osporco looked out and saw a tall man in a horseman's cloak, which said he lacked a lodging; and as he was but one by himself they let him in, and he has lodged there ever since. Rosalba. But is he a Conjurer? Mariana. Surely, my Lady, no one but a Conjurer was ever heard of to come flying through the air in that way. And besides that, he is a magnificent man to look at, and orders this and orders that, as though he held the Powers of the Air at his bidding. And then he wanders out by moonlight a-culling of simples; and he heals the sick; and they come to him from ten miles round; though Father Fungoso tells them it were better to die and be saved than be healed and be damned. But the Falconer says that, be it as it may with us, Alathiella has no soul to trouble her and she may take any cure she can come by. Fiordeliza. Well, I do not believe he is a Conjurer, or that it will hurt us to heal us. Rosalba, I am sick. Rosalba. Of what, my love? of solitude or of my society? Fiordeliza. I must send for this stranger. Rosalba. Oh, then I know what ails you; it is curiosity. Fiordeliza. I say I am sick; very grievous sick. Mariana, send word of it to the farm, and say that the stranger must come with all the speed he can. Mariana. I will say, with what speed he can in the way of nature; but he must not come rushing through the air with wings. Fiordeliza. In the way of nature will serve; I shall live till he comes in a natural way. But I will give the orders myself. Tell Girolamo to attend me in the conservatory. Come, Rosalba. Scene III. —The Farmstead at Malespina.—Ruggiero alone. Ruggiero. So flies the year, and flying fades. The sun Comes not so like a bridegroom from his bed, And nature greets him with a changing cheek: The willows wash their tresses in the brook That shrank before but swells to meet them now; The plane-tree leaf is piebald with black blots; Upon the snowberry-bush the big drops bead; And the goose plants starr'd patterns of her foot In the moist clay. Swift, changeful year, pass on; Sweet was the savour of thy prime, and sweet Thy fruitage should be; but it strews the earth. Enter Osporco, the Farmer. Good-morrow, friend; the air has some taste now of the sharpness of the season. Osporco. Ay, Sir; the cat sits in the sunniest windowpane and the bees have left the rosier for the ivy. Well, every man his own sunshine, is what I say; and your friend that left us at shearing-time . . . . Ah! he was a friendly-hearted gentleman—and very noble, Sir, very noble; you would have thought yourself at court; he would hand a chair to my wife as though she were the Queen of the land: and when he went away, my daughters wept like waterspouts—I thought some of them would have died of it, and I have but thirteen. My Lady at the Castle (God be good to her!) often asks me about him, and I tell her if I were a Countess I would give him one hundred ducats a year to sit over against me at mealtimes, just to look at. Ruggiero. Then might she forget her food and be famished unawares. I think I know whither our friend is gone; and, barring accidents of the road and the hazards of long journeyings in foreign parts, it may not be long ere we see him. Osporco. Tell that to my youngest daughter and you shall see her quiver again with joy like the tail of a lamb that sucks. But I forget my errand. There is an old man at the cottage, Sir, which cannot be persuaded but that you can make him young again if you please, he has heard so much of your skill in curing divers diseases; and there is a young woman that has a quandary. Ruggiero. A what? Osporco. A quandary, she calls it; but, indeed, I think it is a crack somewhere. And Gambo, the grazier, hath brought you his wife that hath the ringworm on her finger and the rattlesnake in her tongue, and prays you would take and cure her: but, indeed, if you cure her he cares not that you should take her, and if you take her he cares not that you should cure her. Ruggiero. You are merry, my friend. Osporco. The frosty air, Sir. But, to speak soberly, there are at the cottage no fewer than fifteen men, women, and children, which think you can cure anything, and have come to be cured of their simplicities. Ruggiero. I wlll attend them. I have said often and I say it again, that my doctor's lore is but the scattered lights that came across me in my studies and meditations. But if they can reach no better skill, they may command mine. Scene IV. —A lane in the Neighbourhood of the Castle of Malespina—A Provost and two Marshalsmen. Provost. We must by no means follow him in; for being the castle of the great Chamberlain's daughter, 'twere an offence to enter it. 1st Marshalsman. On the King's errand? Provost. Better for such as we to look to the Chamberlain than to the King. If a man would prosper, he should be more nimble to please those near above him than those far above him. Even were the King to remember a small service, it should hardly fall in his way to befriend us. 2nd Marshalsman. He would not so much as know our names. Provost. Moreover, it is better to do no man a displeasure than to do any man a good turn. For you may be sure of reprisals, but who can count upon rewards? 2nd Marshalsman. Truly there are ten revengeful men for one that is thankful. Provost. Therefore, though we could take the Count no other way, I would not follow him into the castle; but if we watch for him as he comes out we cannot miss him; and if we do not tarry long we may get half-way through the forest with him before nightfall. 1st Marshalsman. Sleeping at St. Elmo's in the forest to-night, we should reach the court on Wednesday. 2nd Marshalsman. Then we are to ensconce ourselves here. Provost. Behind yonder busher, close to the gate. Scene V. —The Castle of Malespina.—Fiordeliza and Mariana. Fiordeliza. Not if he came back to you weeping, and went on his knees to be forgiven? Mariana. No, my Lady; if Giovanni were to do so by me, I should say, once gone and gone for ever. Fiordeliza. 'Twere to be of a most unchristian spirit, if he were truly penitent and you should not forgive him. Mariana. I would forgive him: but I would kill him first. Fiordeliza. That were indeed to temper justice with mercy; only the justice should be sharp and the mercy something tardy. Come, Mariana; you are in the bud still,—green and hard. I remember, I, too, when I was young . . . Mariana. Why, my Lady, eighteen is not old. Fiordeliza. When I was young I was of your way of thinking; I used to say to myself, You and I, my good Fiordeliza, will not trouble our hearts about mankind, unless they should cling to us and cleave to us and lick the dust from our feet: but change grows out of time as a plant grows out of the earth, and in a year or two we are no more like what we were than the blade is like the seed. Adversity tames us, Mariana, as winter tames the birds. Do I look pale and sick? Mariana. No, my Lady; a little pale, it may be, but not sick. Fiordeliza. That is not as it should be; the Conjurer will not believe me, and he will be here anon. Shut out the light a little. Now go fetch me my scarf, to muffle me up. [Exit Mariana. I'm but the mimic of my former self, And wretchedly I do the imitation! Ruggiero! oh Ruggiero! bitterer tears Than tenderer women weep I weep for thee; And thou, with all thine insight, never saw'st Their source, it lies so secret and so deep. Oh, much I wrong'd thee! many a time and oft I wounded thee through petulance and pride, And love's delight in sporting with its prey, And wayward wilfulness; but though a child In frowardness and mischief, I was still A woman in my love—and, oh, compare Man's love with that, and see how thin the thread, How frail the tissue! Me nor wounds nor slights, Insults nor injuries, nor life nor death, Could e'er have sunder'd. Yes, 'tis gone, 'tis past,— Past and he knows not and will never know What treasures of the mine were hidden beneath The wild-flowers and the weeds! For ever gone! Methinks that I could weep no less for him Than for myself, that he should lose my love, It is so great and deep. But what cares he? He has Lisana's. Had he been but cold I could have borne it—but so false, so false! Re-enter Mariana. Mariana. The Conjurer has come. Fiordeliza. Oh, has he? Here— Look—wrap this round me; so,—now bring him in. [Exit Mariana. If he should prove a soothsayer indeed He'll draw the curtain from this mystery And tell me both what present harbour holds Ruggiero, and what fate the future breeds For him and me. I trust it is no sin Seeking to soothsayers in such straits as mine; But if it be, I must. Yet I shall blush To question him. I'll turn away my face And seem to be, what verily I believe I shall be soon, by mortal sickness seized. Then, after, I'll revive. [Lies down on a Couch. Enter Ruggiero. Ruggiero. Softly, she sleeps. Oh, blessed Sleep! what art can vie with thine In healing of the sick! oh, pious Sleep, Sister of mercy! nurse her back to health. She stirs! Have I awaken'd her? Fiordeliza. Some spell Of wondrous potency he mutters now; For at his voice there comes a gushing up Of twenty bubbling springs that fill my breast With joys of other days.—Sir, if your art Can track diseases to their caves, I pray you Pronounce of mine, and whether in the mind It kennels or the body; for the print Might either way incline me. Ruggiero. Fiordeliza! Fiordeliza. Who calls me? Now I know that I am mad. What voice is that? Ruggiero. The voice of one who once Could please you, and though that may no more be, Would still bestead you. Fiordeliza. 'Tis his voice! Ruggiero! Ruggiero. Forgive me, Fiordeliza, if the charm Of some deceitful hours too quickly past, Too slowly parted with, misled my steps To haunt your whereabout. Forgive me, you; I, should I minister to your present need, Would then forgive myself. What ails you? Fiordeliza. Me? A headache—nothing—nothing you can cure. You minister to me! I thank you,—no: If need were I could die; but, praised be God, I am not in extremity. A quip That put me in good humour were a cure For all that ails me. Ruggiero. Then the word was false They brought? Fiordeliza. 'Twas falser than the father of lies If it cried “help” to you. Ruggiero. No need of this; Of vehement disavowal there's no need To undeceive me had I thought you kind. I have but to recall the past. Fiordeliza. What past? Speak out your quarrel with the past; and I Will tell you of my quarrel with the present. I was kind once unless my memory errs, And if I seem'd to change without a cause What since has follow'd shows that cause enough There might have been; for aught I know, there was. How read you then the history of the past To make me seem too harsh? Ruggiero. How read I it? I read it but as they that run may read; A tale of no uncustomary kind: The love whose dawn beheld its earliest glow Reflected, as it rose to perfect day Saw the bright colouring of the vaporous cloud Grow pale and disappear; my springing love, So long as it was pleasant, light, and free, Was prosperous; but it pass'd too soon to passion; I could not make a plaything of my love; I could not match it with your sportive moods 'Till garlands should be conjured into chains; I could not lightly agitate and fan The airier motions of an amorous fancy, And by a skill in blowing hot and cold And changeful dalliance, quicken you with doubts, And keep you in the dark till you should kindle. I was not ignorant that arts like these Avail, when bare simplicity of love Falls flat; but be they strong or weak, these means Were none of mine; and though my heart should break, (As humbly I believe it will not,) still More willingly would I suffer by such arts Than practise them. Fiordeliza. Have I then practised arts? One art I know,—to judge men by their acts And not their seemings. I should not be loth Some faults to own, Ruggiero, did I know That he to whom I own'd them would own his; But there should be a justice in confession; Yours is the greater fault; confess you first. Ruggiero. Most fully, frankly, freely, from the heart Will I pour out confessions; I am proud, Inflexible, undutiful, self-will'd, In anger violent, of a moody mind, And latterly morose; what further? sad, Severe, vindictive. Fiordeliza. How confession loves To fight with shadows whilst the substance flies; You have not said that in a treacherous hour You stain'd another's honour and your own. Ruggiero. That which I have not said I have not done. Fiordeliza. Where is Lisana? Ruggiero. Wheresoe'er she be Her innocence is with her. Fiordeliza. But where is she? Ruggiero. Secrets that are mine own you may command; This is another's. Fiordeliza. You refuse to tell. Ruggiero. It is but for a season I refuse; I may not tell you till St. Michael's Eve; But then I may. Fiordeliza. Gramercy for the boon! Seek, Sir, henceforth the love of those you trust And never more seek mine. Sir, fare you well! Excuse the blunder which beguiled you hither; And hie you, if conveniently you can, To some more distant spot than whence you came. Ruggiero. To you and to your vicinage, farewell! The refuge that is most remote is best: A prison at Palermo not the worst. [Exit. Fiordeliza. A prison! And the King, as some believe, Is greedy for his life. Alas! alas! How cruelly I spake! And at the Farm And nowhere else perchance could he be safe; And I have driven him thence, and he will rush . . . Oh, look! I see his blood upon my hands! Come back, Ruggiero,—dear, beloved Ruggiero! Return—return—I knew not what I said— Come back to me—forgive me—oh, come back! [Exit. Enter Fra Martino and Girolamo. Fra Martino. Where is the Lady Fiordeliza? These letters, Girolamo, bring us the fatal tidings which we have so long expected. Your honoured master died at Jerusalem that very hour that we were sadly celebrating his birthday here at Malespina. Girolamo. Alas! we seemed to know it then, and the letters that tell of it now might be thought but to certify what was seen darkly before. Fra Martino. The Chamberlain writes me that the Countess must repair to Palermo with all convenient speed, for certain ceremonies which the law enjoins. But where is the Lady Fiordeliza? She will be of more comfort to my Lady than I. Enter Mariana. Mariana. Oh piteous spectacle! oh rogues and slaves! That I should live to see it! Fra Martino. Mariana! Mariana. Oh, shame upon you! Shame! to stand like stocks And see him taken! Do you hear her shrieks? She'll die of this—I know she will—oh shame! There! hark! she shrieks again! Fra Martino. Who shrieks? be calm; Say what has happen'd? Mariana. They have seized the Count. Fra Martino. What Count? Mariana. His Lordship of Arona. Fra Martino. Where? Mariana. There—not a bowshot from the Castle gate— Before my Lady's eyes. Girolamo. You say not so! Where were my men? Mariana. Your men indeed! What men? You have no men; Twenty bald heads I saw put out at windows, And gouty feet went shuffling over floors; But as to manhood, there is more in me Than in a hundred of such mummies. Oh! Had there been one stout-hearted wench to back me! Fra Martino. Run, Girolamo—send a summons round To all the Count's retainers. Oh, those cries! Go, take her to her chamber.—Is she there? ACT V. Scene I. —The Station of St. Elmo in the Forest.—Silisco in pilgrim's weeds. Silisco. Full many from the Holy Land return Less holy than they went; my pilgrimage, In gratitude and earthly love begun, To heavenly, let me hope, shall lead at last; For 'twas not ended when I westward turn'd, Nor was I more in Palestine, methinks, A pilgrim and a stranger in the land Than here in Sicily I feel myself. Hark! there are voices! travellers, no doubt; This shelter then will not be all mine own. Why should it be? So churlish am I now That nothing pleases me but Solitude, She that for shadows keeps an open house And entertains the Future and the Past. Yes—there are voices—from which side I know not; And through the mist is nothing to be seen But apparitions thin—the ghosts of trees. Enter the Provost and Marshalsmen, with Ruggiero as a Prisoner. God's mercy! 'Tis Ruggiero! Hush, be still, Unruly tongue! In custody, I think. Provost. Foul ways, foul ways! When a bog, a fog, and a forest conspire, 'tis well for travellers to be housed betimes. Hey! but here's a Pilgrim before us! Light a fire, my lads. Ha! here's the blood of old Guffo on the hearth-stone still. He resisted to the death and we were forced to slay him. God save you, Sir Pilgrim! Silisco. Save you, Sir! Provost. You see here a great man, Sir, that was once. But we will say no more. The course of justice, Sir. Silisco. I have heard that greatness and justice come together more often as opposites than allies. Provost. Hey! How is that? Seek about, lads, in the wood for the driest sticks you can find, and I'll fetch down the rushes from the loft—looking to locks and bars though first. [Exeunt Provost and Marshalsmen. Silisco. Ruggiero! Ruggiero. Sir, you know my name; what more? Silisco. Much more, Ruggiero. Am I then so changed You know me not? Were you as changed as I I scarce can think that beard or gown or hood, Or tawny paintings of the Syrian sun, Or inward alteration working out, Could hide Ruggiero from Silisco. Ruggiero. Ha! Silisco! Grace defend us! whence art thou? Silisco. From Palestine. But is it thus we meet? What courtly perfidy or princely lapse Hath brought these cursed fetters upon hands That might have preach'd with Paul? Ruggiero. Of that anon; 'Tis but the chafing of the love-sick King At losing of Lisana. And you come From Palestine? Then the good Count is dead? Silisco. No care could save him. To my charge he gave A priceless relic for Rosalba's hands, Wherewith I now repair to Malespina. Ruggiero. Hush! here's the Provost. Re-enter the Provost from above. Silisco. Did you hear a cry? A howling as of wolves? no, did you not? Where be your men? Provost. What! wolves Sir? Blockheads! dolts! If there be wolves, why come they not within? [Exit. Silisco. Go, seek thy fellow-blockheads in the fog And spare us time to speak. Lisana, said you? Was she the cause of quarrel? Ruggiero. She it was; Seeing I hid her from his amorous quest, And where, he cannot to this day divine. 'Tis in the convent of San Paolo, Whereof my aunt is Abbess. She fulfils The time of her noviciate there, which past She takes the veil. I kept myself conceal'd Till that were done; and now the day draws near, St. Michael's Eve, and, luckless that I am! These marshalsmen have clutch'd me. Silisco. Luckless? No; When we two come together, I deny That Fortune can be adverse. Two to four? What could we wish? Ruggiero, by my life My blood is bounding in me at the thought As wildly as an unbroken Barbary horse. Hark! are they coming? Ruggiero. Now I know thee well; Thy blooming, gay, ungovernable youth Comes back upon thy face; but rein it in, Rein in, Silisco, the wild Barbary horse; These marshalsmen, untoward as they are, But execute the service that they owe; I would not harm them. Silisco. Circumvent them then; By stratagem we'll spare to break their bones: Yes, yes, I see; by stratagem we'll work; We'll touch them not; we will not lift a hand; Yet shall they fly like madmen through the wood And leave you free. My wits have been to school In many an exigency exercised Since last we met, and scarce shall find their match In clowns like these. Re-enter the Provost and the Marshalsmen, the first carrying rushes and utensils for cooking, the others dry sticks. Provost. Ay, put a light to these and we shall soon have a blaze. Silisco. Oh, Sir! I pray you, Sir, do not step upon the hearth-stone; nor you, Sir, nor you. 1st Marshalsman. What should hinder us? what's in the hearth-stone? Silisco. I beseech you, do not. See now! they have trampled over it, all three of them. Provost. Why what, Sir? what then? Silisco. Why, did you not say that stain on it was from the blood of some malefactor? Provost. Ay, it was old Guffo. How hard he died, the old fool! He was hacked and chopped from nape to chine before he fell, and the blood streaming down his white beard! Ugh! it makes me shudder to think of it! Silisco. And know ye not, then, that this is the night of the release of Barabbas? Provost. I knew it not; but what if it be? Silisco. Must a man travel to the Holy Land to know that? Surely ye are not so ignorant but ye know that there is this night a jubilee of all the malefactors in the regions below, and that if any one shall have trodden this day on the blood of a malefactor, his ghost is permitted to rise at twelve o'clock of the night, on the spot where his blood was trampled. Provost. Where heard'st thou that, Sir Pilgrim? Silisco. What is there! [Starts back and overturns the table. The Marshalsmen rush out of the house, the Provost following and calling them back. Did I not tell you that their wits were weak? I'll warrant them to run three miles through bog and briar, before they stop to take breath. Ruggiero. An easy riddance so far; but the Provost is a shrewd fellow and ere long will bethink himself of his charge. Silisco. Should he waylay us, we have but to trip up his heels and bind him to a tree; and if he hath upon him the key which unlocks these fetters, there is the edge of a file saved. But whither shall we go? Ruggiero. The convent of San Paolo is not far distant; St. Michael's Eve is at hand; and I would fain bid Lisana farewell, and see her take the veil. We will not seek harbour there before that day, lest we should be tracked and she be hindered; but if thou wilt, let us live like wild hunters in the woods till St. Michael's Eve. Silisco. Have with you! there's no roof-tree that I love Like the live roof-tree of the forest. Come. Scene II. —A Room of State in the King's Palace at Palermo. —Rosalba, Fiordeliza, and an Usher. Usher. Madam, his good Lordship your father bade me say he is seeking the King and will presently bring you word what day is fixed for your investiture. [Exit. Rosalba. This is the chamber. When I see again The tapestry and old chairs, a very dream Seems the past year, from which awakening now, My childhood seems the sole reality. Fiordeliza. Yet if I err not, when we last were here Your childhood was the dream; the life you then Were wakening to seem'd very sweetly real. Do you remember? 'twas the second time You met Silisco. Rosalba. Three long days had past (Long though delightful, for they teem'd with thoughts As Maydays teem with flowers) since I had first Beheld him, standing in the sunset lights Beside a wreck half-buried in the sand Upon the western shore. I see him now, A radiant creature with the sunset glow Upon his face, that mingled with a glow Yet sunnier from within. When next we met 'Twas here, as you have said; and then his mien Was lighter, with an outward brightness clad, For all the Court was present; yet I saw The other ardour through. Fiordeliza. And when he came Before the throne and knelt, I watch'd you both, For I was half suspicious, and I saw How from the King his quick eye glanced aside And gaily for a furtive moment fix'd Upon yon Venus rising from the sea Wrought in the tapestry; then he rose and bow'd To you, who answer'd with your sweetest smile, Whilst old Count Ugo . . . . Rosalba. Oh, my Fiordeliza! These tears—these tears—they ought to be for him, The good old man—so pious, so benign, So generous,—they ought to be for him, And yet they are not. It is God rewards Such bounty and benignity as his! God saw his heart, that it was fill'd with love, And mine a cold, unhallow'd, thankless void, And took him from me—took him to Himself— Fiordeliza. Hush! here's your father. Enter Ubaldo. Ubaldo. I have sought the King, But vainly. He secludes himself, they say, Being St. Michael's Eve, for castigation, (Good, excellent man! what land was e'er so blest!) That he may hold high festival unhurt To-morrow. But I doubt not of the day. Be here to-morrow when the Court is held And you shall take your lands. Rosalba. Oh, father dear, May not this homage be more private? Ubaldo. What! A private homage! never heard of one. 'Tis coram curiâ; it must be. Come. St. Michael's Eve shall be no fast for us And you shall find a table spread below. [Exeunt. Enter The King and Nitido, Groom of the Chambers. Nitido. I have tracked her, my Lord; I have smelt her out; and she shall be found in the convent of San Paolo. The King. Is that certain? Nitido. She was seen there by the bedside of a singing girl called Aretina, once one of the wild ones at Palermo, now dying devout in the convent hospital and nursed by Lisana. Aretina sent for her brethren to speak a word of warning to them before she died; they saw Lisana and brought me word that she was then about to profess, her noviciate being just out. The King. Go to Haggai, the old Jew, and bid him come to me instantly. Provide me a habit of a Franciscan friar and meet me here an hour after sunset. Scene III. —The Chapel of the Convent of San Paolo. —The Abbess, Silisco, and Ruggiero. Ruggiero. A welcome day! And is her mind then given To heavenly thoughts and totally discharged Of that unhappy passion which so seized Her spirit for the King? Abbess. With but one moon Of her noviciate, it had drifted by Like the soft tumult of a summer storm. But, cousin, of yourself? say whither next? May I in this deliverance rejoice? Will you live safely now beyond the seas? Ruggiero. Not so; it was but for Lisana's sake That I was fain to skulk; her lot secured, I feel my freedom; I am free thenceforth To enter on captivity. Silisco. He scorns To hide his head upon his own behalf When charges lie against him that assault His unstain'd honour. Would that I could wend With him to Court; for thither, as I learn, Resorts Count Ugo's widow, whom I seek. But in Palermo is a villainous tribe Of Jews that set their faces like a flint Against me, and with rights my folly gave To back them formerly, should they find my slot, Would hunt me to the death, although my skin Were all my death could give them. Madam, here I fain would hide my head. Abbess. Ruggiero's friend Is more than welcome; and for you, my Lord, You're opportune; there's here a hapless girl Upon her deathbed who craves constantly To see you, harbouring in her breast, it seems Some secret that concerns you. Silisco. And her name? Abbess. Silvestra, but the name she went by once Was Aretina. Silisco. Ha! I knew her well; How came she hither? Abbess. Brought some six months since Upon a litter by a turbulent troop Of wild and shaggy men, who seem'd her friends, And craved our care to cure her of a wound Whereof she languish'd, given her in a brawl. We made her welcome to the hospital, And there Lisana nursed her night and day, And though her body might no more be heal'd, Breathed health upon her soul; and now her hour Approaching, there remains upon her mind, She says, this only burthen. Rest you here, Good cousin; here Lisana comes anon, And ere the rite proceeds you'll take your leave. My Lord, I'll bring you to this girl at once, Lest Death precede us, for he comes with wings. [Exeunt Abbess and Silisco. Ruggiero (alone). Time was when with a sorrowful regard I had beheld the clustering tresses clipp'd, The black veil dropp'd upon a face that beam'd With youthful beauty. It is so no more. The fairest flower that e'er was born of earth Were better cropp'd than canker'd. Enter Lisana. Lisana. Oh! my Lord, In this a crowning kindness you confer; I pray'd for this, and faithless as I was, Now that the day had come that was the last, I thought my prayer denied. Oh! friend beloved, Who propp'd this weak heart in its weakest hour, Rejoice with me, and evermore rejoice! Your work is done, your recompense achieved, A thankful soul is saved. Ruggiero. Lisana, yes; I will rejoice; I do; though mortal eyes Must still have lookings backwards. Yet 'tis best; The holiest verily are the sweetest thoughts, And sweetest thoughts were ever of your heart The native growth. Lisana. No more of that, my Lord; It savours of the blandishments of earth. Look onward only—up the eminent path To which you led me—which my feet have trodden With gladness, issuing daily to the light, Till, meeting now the radiance face to face, Earth melts, Heaven opens, Angels stretch their hands To take me in amongst them, glory breaks Upon me, and I feel through all my soul That there is joy, joy over me in Heaven. Ruggiero. Then joy too shall be over you on earth. Mine eyes shall never more behold your face Till, looking through the grave and gate of death, I see it glorified and like to His Who raised it; but I will not waste a sigh On what, if seeing, I should see to fade. Lisana. Farewell! my Master calls me. Ruggiero. Fare you well. I pace a lower terrace; but some flowers From yours fling down to me, at least in prayer. Lisana. Oh beautiful on the mountains are the feet Of those who bring what you have brought to me! And joy and beauty shall bestrew your path If prayers of mine may prosper. Fare you well. [She retires within the rail of the altar in the backscene. Sacred music is heard. Processions of monks and nuns pass in. She kneels; her hair is shorn; a blessing is pronounced upon her by a Bishop; she retires; and the monks and nuns follow. Ruggiero. There passes from the sight of man a face More fit for angels than for men to see; A face that I shall think of in my prayers To nourish my devotion. Now for earth And earth-encumber'd ways. Oh wilderness, Whose undergrowths and overgrowths conspire To darken and entangle—here a mesh Of petty prickly hindrance, there the wreck Of some high purpose stricken by the storm— What wary walking shall suffice to thrid Thy thickets? Happy they who walk by faith And in the dark by things unseen upheld, Knowing that clouds and darkness lead to light Else haply not attained, and knowing too That in this mortal journeying, wasted shade Is worse than wasted sunshine. Enter Silisco. How is this? A tear upon your cheek? Silisco. Is that so strange? Dear soul! Her death was worthy to be wept With showers of tears. Ruggiero. Is Aretina dead? Silisco. Died in my arms but now, meek penitent! With love and joy upon her lips—so sweet 'Twas as the dying of a summer's day; And blessed was the chance which brought me here In time to make her happier in her death. Ruggiero. What was it you could do? Silisco. Her mind, poor girl, Was burden'd with two secrets—one the love She bare me in her earlier jocund days Which 'twas a solace to disclose in death— The other of strange import—on her tongue To tell me when we jostled in the cave And base Spadone stabbed her from behind. 'Twas this,—that that same treasure which was brought From Rhodes on board the luckless Maddalena,— That treasure which we deem'd Calabrian Seas Had swallow'd with the Boatswain and the Mate What time you chased them riding on the storm And saw them wrecked,—yes,—that that treasure still Is extant upon earth, lodged in that cave. Ruggiero. Why then your fortunes are retrieved! Silisco. Much more The fortunes of those three rapacious Jews Whose claim to my late foundered fortunes clung And now will choke them as they come to the top. Still am I fortunate that I can face All claimants, be they Christians, Jews, or Turks; And fortunate beyond my hope in this,— Than I can instantaneously repair In person to Palermo, to fulfil My mission to Rosalba. Ruggiero. Speed you well! I'll follow you to-morrow. For this night In courtesy I needs must sojourn here. Scene IV. —The Pass of Smarrimento in the Mountains near the Convent of San Paolo. —Haggai and Sadoc. Haggai. There's more of moonshine than enough; but here The shadows of the rocks fall black. Ay, here, If we stand close, he comes forthright upon us Without a glimpse to scare him. Sadoc. Three to one Were better though than two. Should Shallum fail . . . But let me whistle once again. [Whistles. Lo! See— He comes. Enter Shallum. Shallum. My brethren, what is here to do? Your messenger was instant and I came; But truly for these mountains and this pass, I like them not, and left my purse behind. Sadoc. Then thou hast nought to lose. Shallum. Except my life. Haggai. And hark you! much to win. Put on this cloak; And when thou hear'st a step, upon thy face Pull down this mask. Shallum. What, what! I will not—nay! What's this ye have in hand? Haggai. Hush! not so loud. Do as I bid thee and I'll tell thee all. Ere long a traveller will this way wend In Friar's weeds. That traveller is the King. He brings the gold and jewels, got from us, For some importunate and secret end, Ten thousand ducats worth: with some few more Deftly bestowed, I fathomed his intent; (Yon Nitido would give his soul for gold) 'Tis from the Convent of San Paolo, By traffic partly and by stratagem, To wrest a Novice for his prey, whom else They presently should cloister. Foul design And monstrous! which to baffle we take back The gold that in our ignorance we gave. Shallum. What! Haggai, would'st thou rob the King? Haggai. The King? Yea, mine own father, were it for his good. Shallum. But nay, the very stones of every street Should rise and join the hue and cry amain To catch the robbers who had robbed the King. Haggai. But who shall say that he was robbed? —not he; To tell it were not more of harm to us Than shame to him. No, no; he'll get him home Discomfited, and hide his face. Look up! Be of good courage; make a cheerful noise Unto the God of Jacob; verily I tell thee, when God put it in my heart To think this thing, and that the gems and gold At noon that left us should come back at night, I was as one rejoicing in his own; I skippéd like a ram. Shallum. I like not this; I am an aged man; I am not bold As one that gets his living on the road With the strong hand. Sadoc. Hark! Haggai. Shallum, stand up here. Shallum. I cannot; my flesh trembleth—nay I cannot; My belly cleaveth to the ground. Sadoc. Then, lo! Get thee up yonder, and when we fall on, Jump thou from rock to rock, and here cry “Ho!” And there cry “Ha!” and “Smite him” on the right, And “throttle him” on the left, that thou which art But half a man, shall seem as thou wert ten. Shallum. Yea, I will get up yonder; I will jump. Haggai. Begone then, for I hear a step. Begone. [Shallum climbs up the rocks. The King enters, and is assailed by Haggai and Sadoc, with cries of “Booty! booty! Kill him! cut his throat! What! wilt thou? What! wilt thou? What! ten to one and stand out!” whilst Shallum shouts from the rocks overhead. Then enters Silisco. Silisco. What's here! a murder? Villains, take ye that. [Stabs Haggai, who falls. Sadoc and Shallum fly. Haggai. I'm slain, slain, slain! Oh, woe is me! I die. Oh, Sadoc, Shallum, cowards, traitors, knaves! No manhood in you, none! I die, I die. [Dies. Silisco. Sadoc and Shallum! As I live, this wretch Is Haggai, the old Jew. The King. (taking the mask from the face). Brave Pilgrim, yes; I knew him, and 'tis he. But who art thou To whom I owe my all unworthy life? Silisco. My name is Buonaiuto. Sir, for yours, I am not so undutiful to ask What, if the moonlight and my erring ears Beguile me not, I may be bold to guess, You loth to speak. The King. Sir, if you know me, this You likewise know, that deep as is my debt For this your service, I have power to pay. Name what you will. Silisco. My Lord, when next we meet It may be I shall ask you to remember The business of to-night. The King. Meanwhile, good friend, Be secret. In my tustle with those knaves I got some hurts and strains. I pray you, Sir, To help me hence, and find me, if you can, A horse to take me to Palermo. So. I walk but clumsily. I thank you. So. Scene V. —The Audience Chamber in the Palace at Palermo. —Enter Steward, Under-steward, and Attendants. Steward. Call you this a Hall of Audience? Why 'tis a ship's cabin in a gale of wind. Here, Trollo, move this table to the wall and set the throne upon its legs. Where's Grossi? Be tender with it, for the three legs that are old have the dry-rot and the one that is new hath a warp. Is Grossi here? Under-steward. No, Sir, he is ill of a surfeit. Steward. I thought so; a walk betwixt bed and board is the best of his day's work. Where is Tornado? Under-steward. He hath a quarrel with Secco, and will not come in the same room with him. Steward. The cause—the cause? Under-steward. Nay, Sir, I know not that. Steward. Then I will tell you, Sir; short work's the cause; Short work it is fills palaces with strife. Nothing-to-do was Master Squabble's mother, And Much-ado his child. A chair of state Each side the throne. The Chamberlain's is one; The other the Justiciary's. So. A footstool for the Chamberlain. That gout Will one day be the death of him. There—so— Now all's in order as befits a Court; Chambering is seated on the right of the King, And Justice on his left. Here's Nitido. Enter Nitido, with an ewer and napkins. What, is the King not risen? Nitido. Risen but now; Three hours behind his wont. Steward. Is he not well? Nitido. He says that, being troubled in his dreams, He walk'd in sleep, and falling from the sill Received some hurts and strains. Steward. Ay, truly, Sir! And hath he seen the Doctor? Nitido. No, nor will; He says he never in his life was sick But when he saw the Doctor. He is robed And will be here anon. Off! Off! he comes. [Exeunt. Enter The King, Ubaldo, and the Chief Justiciary, followed by the Principal Judicial Functionaries, a crowd of Officers and Courtiers, amongst whom is Silisco, still in his Pilgrim's garb. Tribolo the King's Fool, Fiordeliza, and Ladies of the Court. Ubaldo. It is a trick of youthful blood. In my youth I too would walk in my sleep. I remember Filipo Reni mistook me for the ghost of Angelina Spinola, whom he had forsaken. Tribolo. And I would walk too. I remember, walking in my sleep one night, I came into Mistress Barbara Malfatto's bedchamber, and again very suddenly proceeded forth of it by the way of the window; but whether sleeping I walked out or waking was tumbled out, is not written in the Clown's Chronicle. The King. Didst thou fall far? Tribolo. I fell in the garden, and the stem of a daffodilly was broken, besides my leg. My leg was set, and some foolish women call it the best leg in Palermo to this day; but the daffodilly died of it; and his last words were . . . Ubaldo. Enough, Fool; stand aside. Tribolo. Stand aside, the world is wide, There's room for folly and place for pride: Which is which? Quoth the poor to the rich. Ubaldo. Now, if it please your Majesty, this child— Where is she?—shall perform her homage due, And take investiture of Count Ugo's lands. Where is the Countess? Fiordeliza. She was here but now; She went but to her chamber. Ubaldo. Go and fetch her. [Exit an Usher. The King. Meanwhile, if any here, Sirs, hath a suit, This is St. Michael's festival; tis now His time to speak. Silisco. (stepping from the crowd). Sir, if it please your Grace, A suit have I. The King. What suit it be I know not; But this I know, that thou hast rights and claims Which none but I can rate. Prefer thy suit, Or let the recompense be mine to name Unsued for and unsought. Three Jews there be, The one called Haggai, who died yesterday, The other two, Sadoc by name, and Shallum, Whose lives and goods are forfeit to the law. Those goods, whate'er the value, shall be thine, Good Pilgrim; Fame delivers them not less Than a King's ransom; but if Fame should err, Ask more, and it is granted. Silisco. Sire, the sense Of loyal service done is, unbegilt, Worth what you say, the ransom of a King. These goods, the forfeits of those felon Jews; Were sometime own'd by that unhappy youth They prey'd upon, the Lord of Malespina. I would accept them gladly at your hands; And yet . . . . The King. Speak freely; aught beside? Silisco. And yet More gladly would forego them, and receive Another boon,—the pardon, shall I say, Where fault is none?—the pardon of a man Whom should you in your royal heart replace You should yourself replenish, and repay My service fifty-fold—the pardon, Sire, Of one whom once you counted with the first Of councillors and friends, the Lord Ruggiero, Count of Arona. Ubaldo. Pilgrim, art thou mad? Know'st thou this presence? The King. Let him speak, my Lord; He knows his privilege and the presence too; He's by permission bold. The suit he moves Is one of grave concern. That outlaw'd Count I have some cause to think was falsely charged. It may be that too light an ear I lent Too willingly to enemies of his That were no friends to me. But whilst he hides And bids defiance to our writ, our grace Can scarcely flow toward him. Silisco. Sire, not long Shall that obstruction stand against the tide Of your free grace and favour. The King. Here is she Whose comely presence, wheresoe'er she moves, Makes in itself a festival; the day Is more adorn'd. Enter Rosalba. Lady, before I claim The homage to my sovereignty owing, 'Tis fit that to that sovereignty of yours Which Nature crowns, I bow. Queen had I been, Not King, I gladly would have given my crown In barter for your beauty. Rosalba. Nay, my Lord, You had not then so easily been pleased. I pray you, father, prompt me with those words I ought to speak. Ubaldo. Kneel first and put thy hands . . . . The Justiciary. Beseech you pardon me, Lord Chamberlain, This homage by the law may not proceed Until Count Ugo's testament be read. None doubts the Countess by the will inherits; Still doth the law demand that it be read. Ubaldo. Ho, ho! my Lord Justiciary! What's this? Here is the King, the fountain-head of justice! Who is it that shall dare block up its course With muddy gatherings and old wrecks of laws? You, Sir? or you? or you? The good Count died In Palestine, and if a will there was No note of it remains. The King. Indeed, my Lord! I would it were not so; for I must needs Stay this procedure. Deem not I was false, Sweet Lady, or but coining courtly words In owning to a sovereignty of yours; For over both of us the Law is King And I am most constrain'd. Enter an Usher with Gerbetto. Usher. So please your Grace, Gerbetto, the Physician. Gerbetto. To your Grace I bear a mission from the Count deceased, Whom I to Palestine attended: this He charged me to deliver to none but you. [Delivers a packet to the King. The King. 'Tis the Count's hand, though shaken. 'Tis his will. Ubaldo. Ah! there's a guardian Angel ever waits Upon your Grace! You cannot, if you would, Run cross or counter! See, Sirs, here's the will! You're right, my Lord; the law is still supreme! A will there should be, and a will there is. The King. 'Tis strange in purport. “I, Count Ugo, leave My body to the earth, my soul to God. My worldly chattels to my wife I leave Should she remain unwedded. Should she wed, Or quit this life, I leave them to a friend And fellow-pilgrim to this shrine, by name ‘Buonaiuto.’ Witnessing whereto I set my hand and seal.” Ubaldo. A pilgrim quotha! A pilgrim to succeed! Impossible! A man unknown, unheard of! The Justiciary. Strange bequest! Ubaldo. Waste paper! Rubbish! A preposterous will! The good old Count had doubtless lost his wits Before he died; we saw what small remains Were left him when he took the mad resolve To travel; and that little he had left Did plainly die before him. Rosalba. Speak not so, Dear father! he had doubtless good designs And knew what he was doing. The King (to Gerbetto). Was it so? Gerbetto. The wits that he took hence, my Lord, he kept To his last breath. But I can partly solve The riddle of this will. The man it names Was with the Count throughout; by sea and land, In troubles and in dangers numberless, In perils of the elements in ships, In perils of wild beasts in woods and wolds, In perils of the midnight robber's knife, By thirst and hunger in the desert tried, Fever and sickness in the river's mouth, By strife and blows in cities; and through all That pilgrim bare himself as vow'd and sworn To think of danger, sickness, pain, and death As accidents unworthy to be weigh'd With one hour's comfort he could yield the Count. Thus therefore is it that the Count was moved Doubtless to make this will. The King. And what became Of this good pilgrim? Hast thou seen him since? Gerbetto. We parted, Sire . . . . By Heaven, I see him now! This is the man! The King. This he? our friend at need! He's some knight-errant then that roams the earth In search of bold adventures. Silisco. Sire, not so; That which for good Count Ugo I perform'd Fell short of what I owed him, which was more Than kingdoms could repay. Rosalba. Whate'er it be You owed him, Sir, it cannot be the half Of what I owe to you. The lands he left Will never through my second marriage fall, As he provided, to redeem the debt; But I would fain devolve them . . . . Ubaldo. Daughter! Child! I pray you take me with you. Faith of my body! Devolve them truly! Silisco. Lady, is it so? And will no second nuptials pay your debt? And have you then forgotten that dear pledge Which lifted from the dust one downcast heart And bid it for a season soar to Heaven? Or will you not remember him to whom That pledge was given? 'Tis not long since, though long To him the time; for measuring time by change Threescore and ten he numbers; grief and care Were summon'd to a reckoning and paid up Their long arrears, and from his prime of youth Wherein he rambled to his knees in flowers As heedless as Persephoné watch'd by Dis On yonder plain, he seem'd to pass to age Through life-long tracts of time, nor marvels now That many in this presence know not him Who scarce may know himself; and yet by you, If by none else, he hoped to be remember'd; But be he like or unlike what he was, Known or renounced, remember'd or forgot, You see, thus stripp'd of this dissembling garb, Him that was once the Lord of Malespina. Fiordeliza. Rosalba, are you ill? What face is this To greet a friend withal? Look up, look up. Rosalba. Oh, Fiordeliza, is it he indeed? Is it Silisco? Fiordeliza. God in heaven can tell! Men are such masquers I were loth to say. But if you list to look him in the face Perchance some gleam may cross you. What I see Is a well-favour'd sunburnt gentleman, Whom I, good easy soul, could be content, For fault of one should counterfeit him better, To call my friend, Silisco. Silisco. Yes, in name, Perhaps in fortunes, but in nature not, The same Silisco. Lady, once you said, “A spendthrift never yet was generous.” The word dwelt with me, and its strength and truth, By anguish aided and adversity, Wrought in my heart an inward change entire, And some things you have heard may seem to show I am not what I was, ungenerous. But should I press you now for my reward I well might seem so. Thus once more to touch This hand with lips unused to softness now Is all I hazard. Rosalba. Oh, forgive, forgive The joy that, overjoy'd, belies itself And mimics grief. I would not if I could Dress it in words, but God, who gave the joy, Will give you light to see it. Then will you see A love that from the hour when first we met, That instant of the meeting of our eyes, Possess'd my soul, and suddenly as with a flood And bursting of the chambers of the deep O'erflow'd my life and nature. Wrestling much With destiny, with duty, and with love, I sought for guidance and I seem'd to err; But God in mercy to my sinking soul Has brought it back to life and back to peace, Awakening thus upon a sun-bright shore With Love and Hope to greet me. Ubaldo. Well! why, well! This wheel of Fortune turns about, my Lord. 'Tis very strange! but I believe you well,— That you will use your riches thus restored With better sense of what they're worth. The Provost. My Lords. My duty bids me disabuse your minds; This is no more my Lord of Malespina Than I am King of Sicily. The King. What? what? The Provost. This is that very rogue that tripp'd me up And in the forest set my prisoner free, The Lord Ruggiero. Silisco. Sire, I needs must own That I was guilty of that rescue. Still I hope to be forgiven; for here is he I rescued, ready to repair the fault By re-surrender. Enter Ruggiero. Fiordeliza. Oh, Rosalba, see! See who is here! What will be done? Oh, Heaven Yet the King looks not angry. The King. Count, not yet— Speak not till I have spoken, lest thy pleas Forestall me of my justice in acquittal. Of that offence which thou wert charged withal Touching thine office, I confess thee free: Some flatterers of some follies of mine own Were forgers of the charge. I think, besides, Thou canst acquit thee on a separate score, Though there myself was thine accuser, moved I know not by what promptings of the Devil: I think that thou canst render good account Of that fair maid Lisana, whom by stealth Thou took'st so suddenly from the Court. Ruggiero. My Lord, The maid you speak of is profess'd a Nun; A Nun since yesterday. I lived conceal'd, For her sake solely, till the Church could claim That guardianship she had till now from me. The King. Something of this had reach'd me. You stand clear With me, my Lord; and with no little shame Nor light compunction for my own misdeeds Your offices and honours I restore. But where is she with whom to stand absolved Is best of absolutions—where is she To whom to be restored is more, I know, Than Kings can give or take? Ruggiero. When last we met A cloudy fate had compass'd me about And I was not so fortunate to please Her whom to please in duty, faith, and truth, Has been my life's endeavour: am I now More happy, standing in the light? Fiordeliza. To me Is it you speak? Silisco. Rosalba, look! the tears Break o'er the saucy brightness of her face First to make answer. Fiordeliza. What am I to say? I wonder, Sir, what business 'twas of yours To make that maid a runaway at first, And then, when you were tired of her, a Nun. Ruggiero. Lady, I think you ask me this in sport; But were it ask'd in earnest, I should pray Gerbetto to make answer. Gerbetto. Lady, yes, 'Tis I should speak to this. When summon'd hence To Palestine, I left my child in charge To this good Knight, and well hath he fulfill'd The trust he took upon him. The King. Surely now You will not so untoward be to try His patience longer; think how many a year His suit has linger'd. Fiordeliza. Well, Sir, if your Grace Has less of patience left in looking on Than I that bear the burthen,—then, I think It may be, for your ease and for mine own, I shall be tutor'd to say “Yes”—in time. The scarecrow, Sir, was married to the maypole In time; but, bless me! 'twas a tedious courtship. Ruggiero. On your own time and humour will I wait As heretofore. Fiordeliza. Then, dear Ruggiero, Yes. For 'tis my humour that the time be now. Silisco. Then shall this glorious Now be crown'd the Queen Of all the hours in all the ages past, Since the first Morning's rosy finger touch'd The bowers of Eden. Grace defend my heart That now it bound not back to what it was In days of old, forgetting all that since Has tried and tamed it! No, Rosalba, no— Albeit yon waves be bright as on the day When, dancing to the shore from Procida, They brought me a new joy, yet fear me not— The joy falls now upon a heart prepared By many a trouble, many a trial past, And striking root, shall flourish and stand fast.

Scene I. —A Hall in the Palace of the Archbishop of Sens. The Provost of Paris and Robert the Hermit. Provost. His Grace has not yet risen; his health is weak; But from his chaplain we shall hear anon Whether it please him, when the Council meets, To call you in. I doubt not that he will. Robert. My call is from a greater than his Grace, Whom both obey. Provost. Meantime 'tis fit you know What face we wear at Paris. Robert. France elsewhere Bleeds from a thousand wounds. Each step I took In my long journey hither, brought in sight Old scars and new. What face the town puts on Thou shalt instruct me; for God gives me leave To learn from pious men. Provost. Slowly the King Picks up the fragments of his shatter'd mind, And as the daylight on his reason dawns Beholds his kingdom a bewilder'd wreck Tost to and fro by factions, rent and riven By these two rival Dukes; his brother first, And next his cousin, seizing sovran sway, And each so using it as makes good men Hope something from a change. When Orleans rules With dance and song a light and dissolute grace Doth something gild misgovernment; whilst they Who hear him, 'twixt a revel and a masque, Give audience to some Doctor of the Church, Grave as the Doctor's self and gracious more, Cannot but marvel that a man so sage, And for his years so learned, should misuse The gifts of God and be his country's curse. Then comes that other Duke, revengeful, rough, Imperious and cruel; and they who winced Beneath his cousin's handling, wonder now That they were not content. You'll see them both; For when the King's physicians gave him leave To sit in council, he bade both attend, Thinking to put their discords into tune; Wherein when Jove and Saturn meet and kiss There's hope he may prevail. Robert. On either head A vial will I empty. Provost. Well—so—well— But if I err not, the Archbishop's Grace Would gladly know the purport and the drift Of that you shall discourse. Robert. It may not be. Say to his Grace I know it not myself. Whate'er God puts it in my heart to say That will I speak; but counsel will I none With mortal man. Provost. The courage of the tongue Is truly, like the courage of the hand, Discreetly used, a prizeable possession; But what befits the presence of a King Is boldness temper'd with some touch of fear. Robert. There where I stand in presence of my King, There stand I, too, in presence of my God. Fearing my God I come before my King With reverence, as is meet, but not with fear. Provost. Well, for the King, poor gentleman, no speech How bold soe'er and telling bitter truth Would meet a frown from him. His brother shares The sweetness of his nature. Other clay, Dug from some miry slough or sulphurous bog, With many a vein of mineral poison mix'd, Went to the making of Duke Jean-Sans-Peur. This knew the crafty Amorabaquin. When captives by the hundred were hewn down 'Twas not rich ransom only spared the Duke. 'Twas that a dying Dervish prophesied More Christian blood should by his mean be shed Than e'er by Bajazet with all his hosts. Therefore it was to France he sent him back With gifts,—and what were they? 'twas bowstrings made Of human entrails. Robert. Choice the offering! Yea, Fit bounty of fit patron to fit friend. Provost. Good Robert, neither thine nor yet that voice, Were it again on earth, which sober'd Saul, Can mitigate Duke John, or heal the strife Which from these quarrelsome cousins breathes abroad War, pestilence and famine. Hope it not. Once by his Grace of Bourbon's intercession Peace was patch'd up and injuries forgiven. Well, some three months was wonderful accord; Then came black looks, and then “To arms, to arms!” The sole sick hope of France is in the King. Awhile his malady remits, and joy Lights up the land; then darkness re-descends. Give but to him stability of health And all were well. Alas! it will not be. Robert. Whence came the chastisement the mercy may. Provost. Whence came the chastisement we know; but how And wherefore, was a mystery for long years And diversely discoursed. Urban of Rome Did nothing doubt 'twas that the King had own'd Clement of Avignon; whilst Clement knew 'Twas that he fought not to the death 'gainst Urban; His doctors said 'twas that he ceased their drugs; All doctors else, that he had sometime ta'en them; The people deem'd it in its first assault A judgment for the imposts and the aids, But seeing these have doubled since, they fell From this belief, and as he was a boy When first afflicted, were it this, they said, His Council should go mad and not himself. Thus error is but transient, truth prevails Sure as day follows night, and now none doubts, What to wise men was patent from the first, That 'tis the work of sorcerers, men accursed And slaves of Satan, and by him suborn'd Upon this Christian Kingdom to bring down Disaster and dismay, and snare the souls Of thousands daily shedding brothers' blood. But who they be, these sorcerers, there's the doubt; Not few have been impeach'd and hang'd or burnt; But no success ensuing, the charge, 'tis deem'd, Was fashion'd in excess of godly zeal Which Satan misdirected; thus the quest Is daily keener lest the King relapse; And there be now arrived two monks from Eu Who know to search out sorceries. Much hope Is squander'd on these monks, but for myself I like them not; they ride in coats of mail And waste the night in riot and debauch. Still if they know their art, far be it from me To question of their lives. Robert. If these be evil Their art is not of God, nor aught avails For counterworking Satan. Let them troop. I will not suffer them. Provost. Nay, but we must. 'Tis partly herein to advise the King The Council meets to-day. Enter the Archbishop's Chaplain. Well, worthy friend, What saith his Grace? Chaplain. Good Hermit, come this way. His Grace hath wrapp'd him hastily in his gown And said his hours and waits you in his closet. He's favourably minded, and he says He knows not if your mission be divine, But were it human only, he were loth To let good words be lost. Please you, this way. Scene II. —A Street.—A Religious Procession crosses the Stage, chanting a “Gratias agimus” and carrying a Shrine with the true and entire head of St. Denys, accompanied by a throng of citizens. 1st Citizen. Well, for this mercy of mercies God be praised! And if his gracious Highness would but please To walk abroad, should not his eyes behold The loving'st truly and the joyfullest city That earth can show. 2nd Citizen. I never saw the like; 'Tis as a town for many a month besieged When now the siege is raised and food and wine Come in by cart-loads. Seem'd we not before Half starved, and now half tipsy? 3rd Citizen. Starved we were And starved we are; but foul befall the wretch, If such there be, who would not feed for life On husks and draff if so it might please God To keep the King in health. Woman. Bless him for ever When he was well, not one so mean among us But he could spare a smile to make her happy. Bless his sweet gracious kingly face! I saw him Kneeling at mass so comely and so holy! But Lord, Sirs, he was ghostly pale. Priest. Poor soul! What hath he suffer'd! Never king but David Was so tormented; yea, the sorrows of Hell Gat hold of him. 2nd Citizen. Alas, and may again! 3rd Citizen. Mercy forbid! Priest. St. Clement's Eve draws near; 'Twixt this and then, watch ye and pray. Ye know The ancient verse writ with a raven's quill Which threatens at that hour the House of Valois. 'Tis thus it runs: “When fourteen hundred years and seven “Have slid since Jesus came from Heaven, “Fates and Furies join to weave “A garland for St. Clement's Eve. “House of Valois, hold thine own! “A shadow sits upon a throne. “Ware what is and is to be, “There's blood upon the Fleur-de-Lys.” Wherefore if aspects evil and malign Ye from that House would turn, 'twixt this and then Watch ye and fast and pray. 3rd Citizen. Yes, father, yes; And ever 'tis my prayer that God would please To point a finger at those sorcerers That work the King this ill. Give us to know What men they be, we'd slice them into gobbets And fling their flesh to the dogs. 2nd Citizen. Look, who comes here; Surely the wise and worthy monks from Eu Who come to search it out, and with them one That's sore suspected, Passac, the King's barber. Enter from the side at which the procession had passed out Father Buvulan and Father Betizac, followed by two Marshalsmen with Passac in custody and a throng of Citizens shouting. Passac. Oh hear me! Sirs, alas, ye will not hear me! Citizens. Where is the cart? the cart has fallen behind: Stop for the cart; no faggots here, no pitch! Passac. Oh hear me, Sirs: I ever loved the King, Yea, was his very worshipper; I hurt him! I that would die to give his gracious soul One moment's peace. Father Buvulan. My friends, ye are not fools, Ye are not senseless blocks; ye have your wits; Ye can discern the truth. Behold this barber; Look at this bag and ring. What shall be said? Here's one that, being barber to the King, Puts me this ring into a corpse's mouth, (A Jew's that had been hung was Tuesday week For strangling Chrisom babies ere the Priest Sweating with haste could reach to christen them), Sticks me this ring into this corpse's mouth, Leaves it three days, then puts it in this bag Sewn with the dead man's skin and fill'd to the neck With his accursed ashes, and the bag Wears next his heart. What shall be said, I ask? Citizens. Away to the stake—hale him along—away! And prod him with your lances as ye go. Passac. Oh, Sirs, 'tis false; I never did such things. Kind, noble Sirs, believe me, for the ring I had it of my wife when I was courting; The bag, Sirs, holds the ashes of St. Maud; 'Twas given me by the Abbot of Beaumanoir By reason I had shaven him fifteen years, When, times being hard, he could not pay in cash And gave me this. Father Betizac. Truly the Father of Lies Sits like a weaver at his loom and weaves. You'll find him, Sirs, as hardy to deny The Eve of Pentecost, when he was seen At midnight in the Rue des Ursulines Ranging and whirling round and round the gibbet, Whiles the dead bodies, swinging in the wind, Sang “Ave Sathanas!” That too he'll deny. Passac. As I'm a Christian man, Sirs, it is false. Father Betizac. I told you so; I knew he would deny it. Passac. At midnight on the Eve of Pentecost I was at nocturns in the Chapel Royal. 2nd Citizen. Oh monstrous liar! I saw thee with mine eyes Ranging and scouring round and about the gibbet At midnight chimes; yea, with mine eyes I saw thee; Thou hadst put on the body of a cur, A cock-tail'd cur. Father Betizac. And did ye mark, my friends, Now as we pass'd the true head of St. Denys, And playing on our easy credulous minds He knelt and cross'd himself,—mark'd ye, I say, How the head frown'd? 3rd Citizen. It did; I saw it frown; An angry frown; I trembled like a leaf. Passac. 'Twas at these monks it frown'd and not at me. 'Tis they that are magicians, as I can prove; 'Tis they. Father Buvulan. Oh mercy on my sinful soul! I ne'er knew Satan so enraged before. Here comes the cart; bring him along, false hound! Mark when he burns if the flames be not blue. Citizens. Bring him along—a faggot each—come on. Passac. Dolts! Idiots! Will ye have my life? Then take it; And may the curse of God and all good men And all the blessed Company of Heaven Swallow you quick, ye blood-bespatter'd knaves, And send you seething to the bottomless pit? Father Betizac. Hoo! grace defend us! What! blue flames already! Look to him, serjeants, he is dangerous; So—knot his hands behind him. Up with a psalm: Sing as ye go the “Deus ultionum.” [Exeunt—the Monks last. Then enter the Bastard of Montargis and Raiz de Vezelay. Montargis. Ay, a good wench I grant you, free and merry Before the wind; but luff her up and lo! Crack goes the topmast, rudder fells the pilot, Split flies the foresail. . . . Ha! is yonder monk . . . . Yes, by St. George it is. . . . Ho, Betizac! I think he hears me. . . . Yes, a lively wench, And, as they all are, winning—till she's won; Then comes a change. De Vezelay. What! is it even so! Has Flos then fallen from her high estate To pass for flat? Montargis. Save when she's furious. Ha! Re-enter Father Betizac. The man I sought—a serviceable man; Wilt do me a good turn? Father Betizac. Your worship's slave, Obedient ever. In my way, my Lord? Aught in my way? Montargis. In one, friend, of thy ways; For thou hast two; with roses strewn is this; That in like manner red—but not with roses. 'Tis in the first I need thee; thou hast spells, Potions and powders, shells and herbs and seeds Gather'd or mixed when Dian in eclipse Made Venus doubly bright. Father Betizac. My Lord, I have; How come by 'twere not good for me to say Nor you to hear. But thus much I may tell; When Ashtaroth and Asmodai were flung From heaven to earth, they harbour'd in a cave In Normandy, when spitting on the ground, There where they spat upgrew a wondrous plant, Whereof the leaves, powder'd and mixed in wine, Are of that virtue they shall change the hearts Of twice-vow'd Vestals. Montargis. Such a one is she Whom I would subjugate; the Northern Lights Shine with no softer radiance, nor frequent A frostier region. Lo! a mineral spell, Less named than known in necromantic lore, I give thee in acquittance. [Gives him a gold piece. Send that drug. Betizac. 'Tis yours, my Lord. Montargis. Ere night? Betizac. My Lord, ere night I'll send it you. Montargis. A Cupid of mine own I'll send to fetch it, rather. Fare thee well. [Exit Betizac. De Vezelay. How's this, Montargis? Flos then fell not flat Till rose another o'er her? Montargis. Well, 'tis true. De Vezelay. Why, here's a change! like Carnival to Lent, Done in a day. Montargis. Truly a Lenten change Fits not my festive spirit; nor do I look For forty days to fast, or four or one. If not befriended by the friar's philter, I know by what; for I am of the mind Of Jean de Malestroit, that scrupulous Count Who beat his chaplain till the good man bent To grant him dispensation. De Vezelay. Ay, but Flos; Is she to dance along the slippery path She thinks shall bring her to the house of joy And find herself confronted by contempt Even at the gates? for was it not this night You were to fly together? Montargis. 'Twas to-night. There is a midnight service in the chapel. Flos and her fast friend Iolande St. Remy Attend it. So do I. The Rue St. Mark Is twenty paces distant. There should wait Two saddles empty and some five well fill'd. Pity it were such goodly preparation Should run to waste. Now Iolande St. Remy Sits on the throne of this unvalued Flos And so shall fill her saddle. De Vezelay. By consent? Montargis. The horse consents and that's enough. Ere dawn We shall have reach'd Montlhery. On the road Her strength shall fail and she shall lack support; Then comes the cunning Friar's well-mixed wine And all is as it should be. De Vezelay. For myself, I hold it less than loyal by a spell To work upon a woman. Montargis. Tut! Reprisals. She cannot by what conjuring you will Be more bewizarded than I'm bewitched. But hark you! we must take some thought for Flos; No midnight freaks for her. My Lady Abbess Must learn that she is mischievously minded And lock her up. Raiz, look to this for me And I will hold thee my true friend for life. I needs must to the council; for at three They meet to wrangle of the King's disease, And cloudy John expects me. De Vezelay. Be content; Flos shall be cared for—you shall know to-night With what success. Montargis. Be diligent. Adieu. [Exit. De Vezelay. Here is a zigzag! I am wicked too In some sort, and with women; but thus to woo And thus to win and thus to strike and stab, Exceeds my tether. Poor forsaken Flos! Not all her brightness, sportfulness, and bloom, Her sweetness and her wildness and her wit, Could save her from desertion. No, their loves Were off the poise. Her boundless flood of love Swept out his petty rill. Love competent Makes better bargains than love affluent; He needs had loved her had she less loved him, And had I less loved her—she might—in time— But no, she never could have stoop'd to me. I'll do his errand—not for his sake, but hers. No better can befall her than this night To ponder in retreat. Some doubtful tale I'll tell to waken up my Lady Abbess, Which, its end answer'd, shall belie itself And leave the damsel stainless. For her friend, Poor Iolande, if I can save her, so; Not through the Abbess—he would smell me there— Some other way—and now that I bethink me, I know the stroke shall strike his lance askew. My Lord of Orleans is no friend to him And loves a chance adventure. He shall hear, And if Sir Bastard come not by a check I'll yield some credit to his conjurors. He's cruel over much. I've heard it said, When Blanche de Honcourt lost her hold, ere long A body in a sack was seen afloat Betwixt the bridges. Such things should not be. Scene III. —The Council Chamber in the King's Palace.— The King, the Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the Archbishop of Sens, and other Councillors. Officers of State in attendance, amongst whom are the Bastard of Montargis and the Provost of Paris. The King. My Brother, Cousin John, and my good Lords, Much have I long'd once more to meet you here, And much it sometimes seem'd I had to say; But, Sirs, my voice is weak, more weak my wits, Being, as I am, new risen from the grave,— The grave, I say, wherein my mind was buried,— And you shall pardon me if tongue or thought Should falter, one or both. We meet to-day To reason of my illness; whence it comes And how to hold it off. But, Sirs, much more I would that ye should reason of the realm, Discern what ails it and divine what balm Shall heal its ghastly wounds. Oh, my good Lords, It breaks my very heart of heart in pieces, So often as I wake from these bad dreams, To find what's real worse. Apply your hearts, I pray you, to restore my Kingdom's health, And then take thought for mine. Archbishop. So please your Grace, Under God's providence, the Kingdom's health Attends upon the King's, whose health and weal Are as the fountain-head whence all the land Is water'd; 'tis in you your Kingdom finds All aid and increase, even as the Psalmist saith, “All my fresh springs in thee.” Burgundy. And therefore first Behoves us reason of the first, and ask Who and what are they that with devilish art Poison the wells and fountain-head of France; And there be now arrived from Normandy Two wise and worthy monks, vouch'd by Sanxerre, Your Highness's true liege and faithful friend, For men of marvellous aptness to rip up The works of witchcraft. He avers, my Lords, The Province hath been purged the last ten years Of wizards to the number of threescore And twice so many witches, which is due Most chiefly to their skill and diligence. I hold it were no wisdom to forego Such aid as theirs. Orleans. One word, my Lords, to that. What know we of these monks or of their art? Save only that Sanxerre (whom God forbid That I should blame, for he is wise and true) Gives credence to their skill. But wisdom errs In nought more oft than putting easy trust In tales when things are dark. For man is loth, In argument where grounded thought is none And yet the theme solicitous, to fold The wings of thought and drop its lids and own That in a night of knowledge to roost and sleep Is judgment's sole sagacity. Thus he That justly should have balanced 'twixt two weights Substantial both though diverse in degree Of credibility, shall lose himself, Intent on vacancy, in snatching shadows And pondering of imponderable motes. I say, Sirs, we know nothing of these monks Nor of their art. Burgundy. Good cousin, by St. George Rumour hath wrong'd thee much if of some arts Thou know'st not more than most. What's that I see Circling thy left forefinger? Jean de Bar, Were he alive, could tell us of a work Wrought on a golden ring which bore enchased The royal arms of France. Orleans. And though he's dead, Mayhap, fair cousin, you shall see him somewhere; And that ere long, seeing the merry pace You travel on that broad and trodden way That leads to his abode. Sirs, Jean de Bar, Who, as ye know, made traffic of my youth And coin'd my ignorance, a just death died. I wish his peers no other. By his aid (Not gifted with that affable accost And personal grace which bids my cousin trust In his own prowess—conquering and to conquer) I hoped to triumph in affairs of love. He promised too to call me up the Devil, Whom (not content with some I daily met Of aspect diabolic) I craved to see. These follies of my green unguided youth Were render'd to the flames with Jean de Bar. Still of the art itself I spare to speak, Dilating but, in quality of witness, The art's practitioners as I have known them: For whatsoe'er they feign'd, I plainly saw The Devil had power on them, not they on him. But whether a veritable power there be By cryptic art and more than natural mean To exorcise, or if not exorcise, Divine whence comes possession, not to me Pertaineth to pronounce, but more to him Who sits amongst us spiritually raised To speak of spirits with authentic voice. What saith my Lord Archbishop? Archbishop. Sirs, 'tis true, As by his Grace of Orleans is averr'd Most wisely, that that function of the Church Which deals with evil spirits is usurp'd, And specially since of late the sword of schism Hath pierced her very vitals (God forgive The unspeakably abominable thieves That thus have rent Christ's garment for a spoil)— Since then, I say, this function is usurp'd By some of ill repute; such we disown; But to deny that incantation used In sacred sort, with ardours apostolic, Can cast out Devils, ay and the Prince of Devils, Were to gainsay what Holy Scripture proves Not less than daily fact. Sirs, for these monks, They should be holy men, but that they are I may not certify; for from their Abbot's Nor other hand ecclesiastical Have they credentials. Orleans. They have none from Nature; Ne'er did I see in church or camp or court— I will not say men like them (for in my time I have seen visages as villainous As any Normandy can send to scare us)— But men of visage more detestable I ne'er saw yet—more cruel-eyed, or men Whose outside of their inside told a tale More foul and loathsome. On the brow of each, Writ by kind Providence that watcheth o'er us, I read the word “Beware!” Burgundy. Twere well, fair cousin, Read where you may that word in books or men, 'Twere read to better purpose. Archbishop. My Lords, these monks I cannot to your confidence commend. But there is one without attends your pleasure, A man of life religious and severe, Both gently born and well and widely known, Who, might it please your Highness, hath been charged, So he avers, divinely in a vision With what he deems a message from on high To be deliver'd in your royal presence Nor otherwise divulged. With your kind leave The Provost shall conduct him in. The King. At once. To pious men our ears are open ever. We'll hear this message. What may be his name? [Exit the Provost. Archbishop. 'Tis Menuot, but in the popular mouth, Robert the Hermit. He is strangely clad For such a presence, but his vows forbid A garb more seemly. Orleans. Let his vow be kept. What is it that he wears? A wildcat's skin To signify he dreams by day? Re-enter the Provost with Robert the Hermit. God's love! Was wildcat e'er so wild? The King. Good Sir, his Grace, My Lord Archbishop, tells us thou art charged Some message to make known. Rise then and speak. Robert. King and my gracious Sovereign, unto whom I bend the knee as one ordain'd of God, A message hath been given me, and I am bid To tell thee in what sort. St. Jerome's Day, My vows perform'd, I sail'd from Palestine, With favouring winds at first; but the tenth night A storm arose and darkness was around And fear and trembling and the face of death. Six hours I knelt in prayer, and with the seventh A light was flash'd upon the raging sea, And in the raging sea a space appear'd Flat as a lake, where lay outstretch'd and white A woman's body; thereupon were perch'd Two birds, a falcon and a kite, whose heads Bare each a crown, and each had bloody beaks, And blood was on the claws of each, which clasp'd This the right breast and that the left, and each Fought with the other, nor for that they ceased To tear the body. Then there came a cry Piercing the storm—“Woe, woe for France, woe, woe! Thy mother France, how excellently fair And in how foul a clutch!” Then silence; then, “Robert of Menuot, thou shalt surely live, For God hath work to give thee; be of good cheer; Nail thou two planks in figure of a cross, And lash thee to that cross and leap, and lo! Thou shalt be cast upon the coast of France; Then take thy way to Paris; on the road, See, hear, and when thou com'st to Paris, speak.” “To whom?” quoth I. Was answer made, “The King.” I question'd, “What?” “That thou shalt see, declare, And what God puts it in thy heart to speak That at the peril of thy soul deliver.” Then leap'd I in the sea lash'd to a cross, And drifting half a day I came to shore At Sigean on the coast of Languedoc, And parting thence barefooted journey'd hither For forty days save one, and on the road I saw and heard, and I am here to speak. The King. Good hermit, by God's mercy we are spared To hear thee, and not only with our ears But with our mind. Burgundy. If there be no offence, But take thou heed to that. Robert. What God commands, How smacks it of offence? But dire offence There were if fear of Man should choke God's word. I heard and saw, and I am here to speak. Nigh forty days I sped from town to town, Hamlet to hamlet, and from grange to grange, And wheresoe'er I set my foot, behold! The foot of war had been before, and there Did nothing grow, and in the fruitless fields Whence ruffian hands had snatch'd the beasts of draft Women and children to the plough were yoked; The very sheep had learnt the ways of war And soon as from the citadel rang out The larum-peal, flock'd to the city gates; And tilth was none by day, for none durst forth, But wronging the night season which God gave To minister sweet forgetfulness and rest, Was labour and a spur. I journey'd on, And near a burning village in a wood Were huddled 'neath a drift of bloodstain'd snow The houseless villagers: I journey'd on, And as I pass'd a convent, at the gate Were famish'd peasants, hustling each the other, Half fed by famish'd nuns: I journey'd on, And 'twixt a hamlet and a church the road Was black with biers, for famine-fever raged: I journey'd on—a trumpet's brazen clang Died in the distance; at my side I heard A child's weak wail that on its mother's breast Droop'd its thin face and died; then peal'd to Heaven The mother's funeral cry, “My child is dead For lack of food; he hunger'd unto death; A soldier ate his food and what was left He trampled in the mire; my child is dead! Hear me, O God! a soldier kill'd my child! See to that soldier's quittance—blood for blood! Visit him, God, with Thy divine revenge!” The woman ceased; but voices in the air, Yea and in me a thousand voices cried, “Visit him, God, with Thy divine revenge!” Then they too ceased, and sterner still the Voice Slow and sepulchral that took up the word— “Him, God, but not him only nor him most; Look Thou to them that breed the men of blood, That breed and feed the murderers of the realm. Look thou to them that, hither and thither tost Betwixt their quarrels and their pleasures, laugh At torments that they taste not; bid them learn That there be torments terribler than these Whereof it is Thy will that they shall taste, So they repent not, in the belly of Hell.” So spake the Voice, then thunder shook the wood, And lightning smote and splinter'd two tall trees That tower'd above the rest, the one a pine, An ash the other. Then I knew the doom Of those accursed men who sport with war And tear the body of their mother, France. Trembling though guiltless did I hear that doom, Trembling though guiltless I; for them I quaked Of whom it spoke; Oh, Princes, tremble ye, For ye are they! Oh, hearken to that Voice! Oh cruel, cruel, cruel Princes, hear! For ye are they that tear your mother's flesh; Oh, flee the wrath to come! Repent and live! Else know your doom, which God declares through me, Perdition and the pit hereafter; here Short life and shameful death. [Exit. Burgundy. Ho, ho! My Lords, What say ye to my Lord Archbishop's friend? A prophet or a railer? Nay, Sirs, speak; Or have dumb Devils enter'd you? Orleans. My Lords, I with his Grace of Burgundy my cousin Stand equally denounced; yet deem I not That holy man a railer. To my ears He spake disastrous truth, and from my soul, Sore wearied with the burthen of its sins, I grieve for what is past, and pray that God, Whose goodness and whose multitude of mercies I rankly have abused, will give me strength By works of penitence to rescue France, War-wasted France my mother, and as a brand Pluck'd from the burning, her unworthiest son. And cousin of Burgundy, for all words and deeds Of this and other days that did thee wrong I humbly crave forgiveness, first of God And next of thee; and in the Celestines In token of contrition will I found Two daily masses for thy father's soul. Burgundy. Gramercy, my good cousin, by St. George I bear no malice, I, nor ever did. Here is my hand; I swear from this time forth I'll love thee as myself, yea heartily; And to thine enemies I hold my sword As counter as to mine. And now, my Lords, To business. For these Augustinian Monks, Are they at hand? Montargis. My Lord, they were not summon'd. Burgundy. Not summon'd? Provost. But they are not far to seek; For in the Rue des Ursulines but now I met them, with a rabble that rear'd a stake, And in their hands one Passac at his prayers Waiting to be confess'd. Orleans. What! Passac? No! My good friend Passac! He to burn! God's death! Attendance there! I'll see to that myself. [Exit. Burgundy. Send for these Monks. The King. Good cousin, no, not now. My head is weak; I may not tax it more. My Lords, pray pardon me; another day I'll ask your further aid. The Monks can then Be brought before you. This day's conference May well content us, since it heals the strife Betwixt our two chief councillors and friends; And more to their accord I bid you look Than the frail hope of strength renew'd in me To give the kingdom peace. Sirs, fare ye well. ACT II. Scene I. —The Banqueting Room in the Palace of the Duke of Orleans. Tables spread. A company are assembled, amongst whom are Henri de Vierzon, René D'Aicelin, Enguerrand de Chevreuse, Loré de Cassinel, Alain Thibaut, Eustace D'Estivet (the Duke's Minstrel), and Griz-Nez (the Duke's Fool). To whom enters the Duke's Seneschal. Seneschal. His Highness bids you to sit down and sup; He will be with you later. De Vierzon. As he will. What round white arms withhold him? Seneschal. Out, De Vierzon; No damsel is it, but a devotee. De Vierzon. That pretty Theologue De Ricarville Is both in one. I drink her health and his. Stay them with flagons, comfort them with apples! Seneschal. Robert the Hermit 'tis, I tell thee. De Vierzon. So! Then Cupid's case is desperate for a day. What think ye of this pact betwixt the Dukes? Shall it endure? D'Aicelin. Till death. But how soon death, Under the countenance of dear Cousin John, May enter to dissolve it, who can tell? To-day they rode together on one horse, Each in the other's livery. To-morrow They are to sleep together in one bed. The People stare and deem the day is nigh When lamb and lion shall lie down together. De Chevreuse. Rode on one horse! D'Aicelin. Yea, Orleans before, And Burgundy behind. Gris-Nez. 'Twas so they rode: Two witches on one broomstick rode beside them; But riding past an image of Our Lady The hindmost snorted and the broomstick brake. De Cassinel. Would I were sure my gout would be as brief As their good fellowship. De Vierzon. To see grim John Do his endeavour at a gracious smile Was worth a ducat; with his trenchant teeth Clinch'd like a rat-trap. De Cassinel. Ever and anon They open'd to let forth a troop of words Scented and gilt, a company of masques Stiff with brocade, and each a pot in hand Fill'd with wasp's honey. D'Aicelin. Nay, no more of him; The wine turns sour. Come, Eustace, wake thee up! Hast ne'er a song to sing us? Rose and Blanche And Florence d'Ivry with her deep-mouth'd eyes And Merry Marriette,—where are they gone, The score of maids that made thee musical In days of old? or if their date be out, Have none succeeded? D'Estivet. Ah! my youth! my youth! Gone like a dream, and now at twenty-eight I live on recollections. No, my songs Have had their day; the charms I sang are fled; The ears I charm'd are deafen'd in the dust. What would ye with my ditties? But there's one His Highness made, which, if I mar it not, Should find its way. D'Aicelen. Be still, De Vierzon; hush! Eustace d'Estivet sings to a lute. At peep of day, at peep of day, Day peep'd to spy what night had done, And there she lay, and there she lay, Blushing in the morning grey And hiding from the Sun Arise, arise, Aurora cries, My dainty sister sweet, and throws With frolic grace and looks that speak Of love and gladness, at her cheek A dew-besprinkled rose. D'Aicelin. Minstrel, well sung, and well conceited, Duke; What is this whispering, Loré? De Cassinel. Shall I tell? De Vierzon's by an envious Abbess charged That through the convent-grate he kiss'd a Nun; Whereon the Court Ecclesiastical Puts forth a process; this that he may answer To-morrow noon, he fain would have me swear I saw him in St. Michael's on his knees That very hour the Abbess of St. Loo Swears to the kiss. D' Aicelin. And didst thou kiss the Nun? De Vierzon. I may have kiss'd a linnet in a cage, But as to Nuns, oh no. D' Aicelen. Come, I'll bestead thee; As for myself, I have an errand then At Château-Menil; but I'll send my page With orders to swear what you will. De Vierzon. Much thanks; He shall not be the loser. Gris-Nez. Ah, sweet Sir, Had you been pleased to come to me for council Before you kiss'd that Nun! De Vierzon. What then, Sir Fool? Gris-Nez. Knowest thou not, Sir Fool, my brother, One dirty hand can wash another; Ofttimes offences that are twins Shall suffer less than single sins; Stern forfeits tread upon his kibe Who hath not robb'd enough to bribe; To distance justice in the course Who steals a purse should steal a horse; Not hardly the offender fares When Accusation hath gone shares: Receive thou then, dear brother Fool, Monition wise from Folly's School, To kiss a Nun nor fear the worst Thou should'st have kiss'd the Abbess first. De Cassinel. By Peter's keys! to moralize a kiss No preaching have I heard more pertinent. Here comes the Duke—no, 'tis but little Geoffrey. Enter Geoffrey de Laval. Geoffrey. His Grace desires you'll none of you depart Till he shall join you. De Vierzon. With such wine as this To wet our wings, no thoughts have we of flight. Is the lean Hermit with his Highness still? Geoffrey. No, he is gone; 'tis Vezelay that's with him. De Vierzon. Thou dost not say so! Well, the times are strange; To the backbone Burgundian is he And private with the Duke! What next? De Chevreuse. Why next— Enter the Duke of Orleans. They rise to receive him. Orleans. Kind Sirs, I pray you pardon this neglect; Scant courtesy it was not, but strict need. I drink your healths. No, Seneschal, gramercy: I'll neither eat nor sit. My trusty friends, I have a work in hand will ask your aid. The Bastard of Montargis, as I hear, Designs this night to seize and spirit away A pupil of the Celestines; which rape I would not such a rotten-hearted rogue As he is, should accomplish; wherefore, Sirs, Of five of you I crave attendance here An hour ere midnight arm'd. De Vierzon. Your Grace has named A service I shall clasp and strain to heart Even as my best friend's wife. De Chevreuse. And so shall I. De Cassinel. And all. Orleans. I thank you heartily; but no; Montargis is attended but by five, Whom we must not outnumber. Hie ye home, De Vierzon and De Cassinel, and you, René d' Aicelin, Enguerrand De Chevreuse, And Alain Thibaut; hie ye home and arm, And hither hasten back at your best speed. The rest, good-night. And be ye sure, my friends, For right good service your good wills shall count. [Exeunt all but the Duke and Geoffrey de Laval. Geoffrey. A boon, my gracious Lord. Orleans. What is it, boy? Geoffrey. Let me be one. Orleans. No, no; too young, too young. They'd blow thy head off like the froth of their ale And I should lose a monkey that I love. Geoffrey. My gracious Master, at your side to die Is all I live for. Orleans. Be content, young friend. The time may come. Thy horoscope and mine Point to one hour, 'tis said. Enough of this. Go to the vestiary, wherein thou'lt find Provision of all garbs for the masqued ball. Thence to the hall bring thou six pilgrims' weeds. Scene II. —The Interior of the Convent of the Celestines. Iolande de St. Rémy and Flos de Flavy. Flos. A charming little Abbess if you will; That liberty she grants herself, good soul, She not denies to others; so far, well; But then comes Father Renault, spare and dry, With menace of the Bishop and the Chapter, And in her straits we're straiten'd. Oh, no, no, I cannot bear it; some day I shall run; Yes, Iolande, I will, I will. Iolande. Oh Flos! Oh foolish Flos! impatient of restraint Because you scarce have felt it. The loose rein It is that makes the runaway; too kind The Abbess is; for those who say she errs In other ways and worse, God pardon them! Or if their tale be true, God pardon her! But God forbid that I should know it true, For love her I needs must. Flos. What! though she's wicked? Iolande. Yes, though she's wicked. That is not forbidden. In pain and sorrow should I love her then, As I love you. Flos. Oh, I am wicked too? Iolande. No, there I said too much. But yet with fear, If not with pain, you fill me. Flos, from my soul I hate the man you love. Flos. Well, you speak out; But ere you spake I knew it. Iolande. Did you but know The cause !—and I will tell you it in part. Last night I had a dreadful dream. I thought That borne at sunrise on a fleece of cloud I floated high in air, and, looking down, Beheld an ocean-bay girt by green hills, And in a million wavelets tipp'd with gold Leapt the soft pulses of the sunlit sea; And lightly from the shore a bounding bark, Festive with streamers fluttering in the wind, Sail'd seaward, and the palpitating waves Fondly like spaniels flung themselves upon her, Recoiling and returning in their joy; And on her deck sea-spirits I descried Gliding and lapsing in an undulant dance, From whom a choral gratulating strain Exhaled its witcheries on the wanton air: Still sail'd she seaward, and ere long the bay Was left behind; but then a shadow fell Upon the outer sea—a shadowy shape— The shadow bore the likeness of the form Of the Arch-fiend; I shudder'd for the bark And stretch'd my hands to heaven and strove to pray But could not for much fear; the shadow grew Till sea and sky were black; the bark plunged on And clove the blackness: then the fleece of cloud That bore me, melted, and I swooned and fell, And falling I awoke. Flos. Yes, Iolande, You're ever dreaming dreams, and when they're bad They're always about me. I too can dream, But otherwise than you. The God of dreams Who sleeps with me is blithe and debonnaire, Else should he not be partner of my bed. I dreamt I was a cat, and much caress'd And fed with dainty viands; there was cream And fish and flesh and porridge, but no mice; And I was fat and sleek, but in my heart There rose a long and melancholy mew Which meant, “I must have mice;” and therewithal I found myself transported to the hall Of an old castle, with the rapturous sound Of gnawing of old wainscot in my ears: With that I couch'd and sprang and sprang and couch'd, My soul rejoicing. Iolande. May God grant, dear Flos, Your mice shall not prove bloodhounds. That the veil Befits you not, I own; nor if you long In secular sort to love and be beloved Shall I reproach you; for if God denies The blessing of a heart espoused to Him His mercy wills that love should be fulfill'd In other kind, more mixed but still divine, Less happy but still rapt; and to this end In his own image he created Man. The love for Man I blame not; but oh, Flos! There are, though you may miss to see it, men Who have transform'd God's image in themselves Into another likeness. Flos. Iolande, You hate him; you have said so—'tis enough. I love him; yes, and may my false heart perish That instant that it leaves to love as now. And if I thought this heart would so revolt, Or ere one sun had risen upon its shame, It should be buried without toll of bell Six fathom in the earth, and o'er its grave A letter'd stone should tell its terrible tale, And say it was a heart that, having fallen, Would rather rot below ground than above. Oh, take your arms away—you shall not kiss me— Sweet Iolande, I know you wish me well, But is it wishing well to wish me false? Iolande. Not if your truth were plighted to the true. Flos. Whate'er his treasons he is true to me; True as the bravest of the brave in love; True as the lion that laid down its head O'ersway'd by love divine on Lectra's lap. Iolande. Deceived past rescue! Were it Vezelay, He is not good, but I believe him true, Know him but too devoted in his love; Were it but he! Flos. More kind is he than good, Poor mortal! Yet I love his love for me And him some little. Enter the Lady Abbess. Abbess. Well, my daughters dear, The Lord is good and gracious to this House; So is his Grace the Founder. Have you heard? He grants two masses daily for the soul Of Good Duke Philip, whom may God absolve! Truly his Grace's bounty knows no end, Such holy love he has for this poor House. Flos. Likewise its charming Abbess. Abbess. Naughty child! No more of that. Hark ye! the bell for Nocturns. Go, Iolande. For Flos, she stays with me, For I am ill and she a cheerful nurse. Mercy! such shootings in my back! Oh me! And such a shaking here! And then such qualms! And here a gurgling up! By God's good help, St. Bartlemy assisting, I have hope To struggle through the night—but not alone. Come, Flos, we'll sleep together. Bless my heart! Why, Flos is stricken too! How pale she looks! This frost will be the death of some poor souls; The Marne is frozen over. Come, sweet Flos. Scene III. —The Rue Barbette, near the Porch of the Chapel of the Celestines. Raoul de Rouvroy, Ranulph de Roche-Baron, Henri de Fontenay, Antoine des Essars, and Charles de Savoisy, all armed. De Fontenay. What if she screams? De Rouvroy. Tell her the night is cold, And kindly tie a muffler o'er her mouth. De Fontenay. What if the Sisterhood scream all together? De Rouvroy. Run for your lives; but if you're deft and swift The Sisters will have pass'd within the walls Ere you shall scare them. Pupilage walks last. De Savoisy. But say the night-patrol should come this way. De Rouvroy. Then shall some two or three of you fall back And seem to fight; be desperate and loud, And whilst the watch is busy with your brawl, Montargis and his maid will mount and fly. If need be, set a house or two on fire, And shout amain for help. Enter Montargis from the Chapel. Montargis. Down with your vizors. God's curse upon that Priest and his discourse! When tenthly came, and twelfthly, and fifteenthly, I could have stabb'd him. Strangers too were there, Pilgrims—what not? who may be meddlesome Unless discretion guide them. If they be They'll rue it. Ranulph, are the by-ways void? No stragglers? Des Essars. Right, Montargis; say a cat's grace That ever looks about her ere she eats. Montargis. Back, back, I say; stand back; I think they come. Enter from the Chapel the Nuns, preceded by the Priests and followed by the Novices and Pupils, after whom the Duke of Orleans, Henri de Vierzon, René d'Aicelin, Enguerrand de Chevreuse, Loré de Cassinel, and Alain Thibaut, in Pilgrim's weeds. The Priests and Nuns pass through the gates into the court of the Convent, whereupon Montargis advances. Montargis. My lady-love, you enter not; be wise; Despairing love dares all; you must be mine, And mine you are. Iolande. Yours! Wretch beyond all count The loathsomest that I know, I know you well, And hate you and defy you. Montargis. Nay, wild bird, We'll teach you sweeter singing. Iolande. Touch not me! Montargis. With softer touches shall I touch you soon; These rougher for this present you must brook. Orleans. First turn and touch another. Montargis. Who art thou That hold'st thy life so lightly? Beggar, back! Get hence! or if thou hungerest after death Pass forward but a step. Orleans. There is my foot. Montargis. And there thy death. Orleans. Well aim'd against well arm'd. Now, thy best ward. They fight. The other Burgundians come to the aid of Montargis, and are engaged by the Orleanists; Montargis is wounded and disarmed. Orleans. So! yield thee, Bastard. Montargis. Ha! thou know'st me? Well; If to a Knight I yield. Orleans. A Knight and more. Montargis. Say'st thou “and more?” Orleans. More, by St. Paul! Montargis. My Lord, That voice and oath chiming together thus Tell forth your title to respect. I yield. My friends, put up your swords. My own lies there. We will withdraw, if so the victor wills. Orleans. Go, and be wiser. Keep your council. I, For his sake who befriends, will not betray you. [Exeunt Montargis and his friends. Orleans. Unbar the gate. De Vierzon. 'Tis fast within. Holla! Within there! Ho! Unbolt the gate. The Porter (within). Get hence, Ye graceless knaves, get hence! De Vierzon. Unbolt the gate; Here is a maiden of your House has swoon'd. The Porter. So has the general Sisterhood. Get hence, Lewd villains that ye are! De Vierzon. Out, Thickskull, out! Orleans (supporting Iolande). Frighten'd to death I hastily had thought, But ne'er did womanish fear put on a face Of such celestial sovereignty as this. Rather the motions of the bodily life O'ermaster'd by the passion of her scorn. Open that gate. De Vierzon. 'Tis easily said, my Lord; But here's a Lackbrain keeps it barr'd. Orleans. Then stave it. How fare you, Lady? Iolande. Well, I thank you, well; Though dumb when fain a grateful heart would speak As with a thousand tongues, and fill the world With thanks and praise; but there is God to aid, Who pays all dues. Orleans. Sweet Lady, when God grants That praise from such a mouth ennobles me, He showers His choicest blessing. They within Must pardon us some violence, for else, Through error of their fear, this sturdy gate Should have repulsed its own. Iolande. Brave Sirs, farewell! And though 'tis little that poor Nuns can do To show their sense of service, there is one As great in power as heart, the princely Duke Our founder, who will value at its worth A service to the Celestines. Orleans. My friends, I wish you joy; and with this lady's leave I'll wait on her to-morrow, so to learn What guerdon you may look for. Iolande. Heartily The Lady Abbess and myself will strive To do you grace and honour. Pray you, Sirs, Stay by the gate till I shall cross the court, For all have fled indoors and it is void. [Exit. Orleans. Now to our beds. Sirs, what she said I swear; A service to the Celestines I prize At a knight's fee to each. To bed, to bed, To dream of such a voice as in my ears Sounds like a Seraph's in a song of praise. Enter the Watch. Sergeant of the Watch. Haro! Haro! What's here! Stand, villains, stand! Clashings of swords and screamings for the Watch! How dare ye! To the guard-house every man. De Vierzon. Off! laggards, we were keepers of the law, Not breakers; we but filled a gap for you. We fought with certain caitiffs who were fain To ravish hence a maid; we rescued her; For them, they slank away. Sergeant. Fie! tell not me! We'll have no ravishings nor no rescues here; No ravishings nor rescues can be suffer'd After the Watch is set. To the guard-house, come. If maidens shall be ravish'd and be rescued It is the Watch must do it. Come, ye rogues. De Vierzon. Stand off, old Owlet. The Sergeant. What! the manacles! Ho! D' Aicelin. Away, ye Clot-pole-catchpoles! Hence, away! [The Duke and his friends drive out the Watch. ACT III. Scene I. —The Court of the House of the Bastard of Montargis. The Bastard of Montargis and his two Squires, Raoul de Rouvroy and Ranulph de Roche-Baron. Montargis. The house I speak of bears above the porch An image of our Lady; old and batter'd Are house and image both: none dwells within Save a bald porter, old and batter'd too. Let his old ears inform him I have need To store some wine that comes to me from Bourg, And hire the house; give him whate'er he asks; Then cask these weapons that I tell you of And take them thither. On this roll is writ The names of certain of my men at arms; Call them together; hold them on the wing, And after nightfall drop them one by one Into that house. Then keep them fast and close, And till I come,—mayhap to-morrow night, Early or late,—let no man pass the door. Be secret, ye and they. [Exit. De Roche-Baron. What may this mean? De Rouvroy. Mischief it means, if I have ears. Tomorrow Will be St. Clement's Eve. The Bastard walks In the world's eye untroubled, but in heart He bears his Monday night's discomfiture As new caged tigers bear captivity. Some bird has whistled that the booty wrench'd From him, has fallen to that crowing Duke, Whom if he hated humanly before He hates with hatred more than human now. With that he broods upon a prophecy Which babbles of St. Clement's Eve, and tells How on that night the gutters shall run blood, And lilies redden in the morning sun. There is an ancient picture too, wherein St. Clement, with the anchor round his neck, Sinks and draws with him underneath the wave A knotted staff, twined with the Fleur de Lys, And holding on its point a porcupine Enscrolled with “Far and Near,” the Duke's device: And hearten'd by these figurings and sings He holds the time auspicious. De Roche-Baron. But Duke John— Him must we carry with us; without him I hardly deem St. Clement will suffice To hold us harmless. True, revenge is sweet, And neither thou nor I have cause to love His Grace of Orleans; but revenge were mad Without the one Duke's warrant and support, In case of need, to practise on the other. De Rouvroy. Trust to the Bastard to draw in Duke John. He's forward in a scheme for melting down This newly-solder'd fellowship of the Duke's. He's gone even now to put it in the pot Of those two Monk-magicians. As for me, My lot is cast with his; whither he dares, Thither I follow. De Roche-Baron. With Duke John to boot, I say the same. De Rouvroy. No question of Duke John; No question but he'll lead him like a lamb. Scene II. —An Apartment in the Château St. Antoine furnished with a brazen head fixed on a skeleton, crystal globes, magic mirrors, and celestial squares.— Father Buvulan and Father Betizac. Father Buvulan. For a brief moment I was high in hope They both would burn. Truly he singed his beard In saving of his barber. Father Betizac. Well, it shakes us. Unstable is the commonalty ever; The Duke had but to tickle them with tropes, And Passac was their chuck, their duck, their darling, Their Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, That in our heathen fire had walk'd unhurt. Oh 'tis a fickle and a foolish people! Their faith is with success; who faileth falleth. When we lost hold of Passac, we lost hold Of credit and repute. De Montenay Sends me his greeting, and he has no need Of the enchanted armour. There's a loss Of some five hundred crowns. De Graville's page Comes with his cozening master's countermand, Who cares not that his horoscope be cast Till better times—God grant his best be bad! Since Tuesday there has been nor maid nor youth To spy their spousals in the magic mirror. All day the knocker sleeps upon the door As it were dead. What! now it stirs. Come in. Enter the Bastard of Montargis. Montargis. So! Reverend Fathers! winters such as these Make fuel dear; 'tis cruel to the poor To waste the store; when next ye light your fire Look that there's something on the spit to roast. Father Buvulan. His Grace of Orleans in his brotherly love May, if it please him, set all traitors free To do their devilish work upon the King. Our part right loyally have we fulfill'd, And stand acquitted. Montargis. In your consciences,— Yes doubtless in your tender consciences Ye stand acquitted; but elsewhere how stand ye? The Duke, who snatch'd away his friend the Barber,— So seasonably, just as his wig was frizzled,— Think ye with him ye stand acquitted? No, Beware his wrath. And let me tell you, friends, This frizzling of a barber doth but clinch A foregone condemnation. Have ye heard How ye were handled at the Council-board? Your very eyes and noses could not 'scape, But seeing that they did not please the Duke, Plain documents were they of your damnation Confirm'd in Satan's signature and seal. To my poor thinking, Sirs, His Grace's speech Savour'd of pitch and resin. Ye best know (For through affection and a burning zeal Ye are well seen in fagots and the stake) If it be pleasant to ascend the skies In manner of an incense; but if not, I counsel you to find some present shift For dwelling in the flesh. Father Betizac. Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh God be merciful! What mean you, Sir? Know you of aught devised and put in hand Against our lives? Montargis. Of what I know, my friends, I tell you what I may. Father Betizac. Oh, Sir, sweet Sir, What may be done? Befriend us in our need. Will gold redeem us? We have here laid by, Out of our honest earnings, a round sum In crown and ducats; will it please you take And use it at your pleasure? Montargis. No, Sirs, no; Gold will do nothing; ye must find a friend To match a foe so mighty; who is he? One only Lord there is, one only Prince, Of such sufficiency as to ward the blows Of the King's brother. Give yourselves to him Bravely and wholly. Danger is a dog That follows if ye fly, flies if ye face him. Father Buvulan. Surely his Highness knows us for his own. Oh, excellent Sir, commend us to his Grace; We wait upon his every wish and word. Montargis. Commend yourselves by service. Well ye know, If aught your art avails you, who it is That by his damnable practice hath let loose These troops of demons that torment the King,— A sin by so much worse than fratricide As hell is worse than death; ye know it well; It is the Duke his brother. What ye know That daringly declare, and ye are safe. Father Buvulan. Oh, Sir, it was but reverence and respect For the Blood-Royal muzzled us till now; But at his Grace's honourable bidding The truth must be declared. Montargis. His Grace's bidding? The servant who doth only what is bidden Shall earn but scant reward. He that divines His master's need and feeds it, serves him twice; Serves him with head and hand and heart and will; This is the saving service. Father Buvulan. Sir, 'tis well; This service we will render, and the truth Unflinchingly avouch. Montargis. Truth is a gem Of countless price; and life too is worth something. Once more the Council in its wisdom meets To vex the question of the King's disease; Ye shall attend it. Come meantime with me; A little of my teaching will ye want Ere ye proceed adepts in speaking truth. Scene III. —The Convent of the Celestines. Nuns and Novices at work embroidering vestments and altar-cloths. 1st Novice. I was next before Iolande, and heard a kind of soft scuffle behind, and, turning round, I missed her; and oh! woe is me! I cried, there is a maid gone and it might have been I! And I looked through the grating, and there he stood, a tall man and a beautiful bachelor. He bade the other touch him if he dared; and there were words and oaths, and when they drew their swords I squealed and ran away. 1st Nun. Ay, and it was time, too. Who taught thee to look at a man through a grating? 1st Novice. Nobody, Mother; I was looking for Iolande. 1st Nun. Then do so no more. If a maid look through a grating what may she not see? Peradventure the Grand Turk and all his Janissaries, and I know not what masquings and mummeries; or the six Satyrs which danced at the widow's wedding with no more clothing than a beast's, and by God's providence took fire and were burnt; all except his gracious Majesty, whom God preserve! 2nd Nun. Yes, Sister, there was another saved; which was Jean de Nantouillet; seeing he flung himself into a trough of water which was there for cooling of the wine, and calling upon St. Winifred, she endowed the water with that virtue that it quenched the flames. 1st Nun. But saidst thou a tall man, eh! and with a long nose? 1st Novice. Tall, Mother; and for his nose, it may be long or may not, as it pleases God; for there was but a small matter of moonlight to see it by. But he was not a Turk, which has tusks, they say, like a boar; nor a Satyr, which is shaggy. 2nd Novice. Twice since has a tall man come hither by the garden gate that was left open for him. I saw him through the casement in the dormitory. 2nd Nun. Fie! fie! This looking out of casements is unseemly. Marcian looked out of a casement and she saw a little boy with a bow and arrow, which was a heathen and shot at her. Was he a fair-faced man with blue eyes and a light-brown beard? 2nd Novice. I know not, Mother, for his hat was drawn over his brows, and he held his kerchief to his face as though he had the toothache. 3rd Nun. Marry, and I'll warrant you God sent a toothache no sooner than he deserved. And if I were Abbess there should be no leaving open of gates for sinners to come in with their blue eyes and their brown beards. 4th Nun. Yea, and their rapiers at their sides like leopards, gaping and prancing up the walks that one knows not which way to turn for them. 5th Nun. No more prating and prattling. Come, Marceline, sing us one of thy holy songs, which is better than our babblement. 3rd Novice. I will sing you the song of the Knight and the Dragon. From men that naughty are and rude, Save us, St. Gregory and St. Jude. Amen. It begins so, Mother, and then it tells what happened. 5th Nun. Go on, child; truly 'tis a good beginning, and very necessary. 3rd Novice. A good Knight, hight Sir Vantadour, Got on his horse and rode an hour; Out of the city he rode amain, And came to a forest that stood on a plain. So full of wild beasts was that wood, Enter it no man durst nor could; And those that did in twain were cleft, And eaten up till nothing was left. Through the wood the Knight rode forth For half a day, from south to north; When, lo ! a Dragon he descried, And on its back a Lady astride. That Dame and Dragon were akin, Pride was he and she was Sin; The Dragon hiss'd and rear'd his crest, The good Knight laid his lance in rest. “Beware,” said Sin, “for Pride is strong, And mighty to uphold the wrong; And woe to those that him attack, Hissing, with me upon his back.” The Knight he rode a-tilt and smote The scaly Dragon in his throat; The Dragon writhed and hiss'd and spat, But nowise blench'd the Knight thereat. Then call'd the Dragon from six caves Six Blackamoors that were his slaves; The Knight bade each and all advance, And featly slew them with his lance. Likewise the Dragon. Sin the while No longer frown'd, but seem'd to smile; And called six Syrens fair to sight, Who flung their arms around the Knight. But back he stepp'd, and “Lo!” said he, “To fight with maids is not for me; I know to fight where fame is won, But now best courage is to run.” So first he fought, and then he ran, Sir Vantadour, that righteous man: And we from his ensample learn, To flee from Sin and Pride to spurn. Holy St. Gregory, grant us grace To spurn at Sin and spit in her face. Amen. 6th Nun. Well, I pray God and St. Gregory that Sin come no way near us, nor a Dragon neither; and if one shall come that is not Sin nor a Dragon, what I say is, he should not come muffled up and no one to see the face of him. 5th Nun. Past a doubt this Knight which comes once and again is the same which snatched Iolande from the hands of the spoiler. 3rd Nun. Which some will say was sore against her will, for all her scuffling and screeching. I am a guileless woman that thinks no ill; but if ever such a thing happens to me, I shall not stand screeching away to no purpose, I think not indeed. I shall not stand waiting for any chance of a passer-by just to fall out of one man into another. 5th Nun. St. Mary, Sister, it is not for such as thou and I to stand in dread of these dangers. 3rd Nun. Who knows? It is true God has been good to me for sixty years and upwards, but I were too bold to count upon his mercies as though they were never to fail me. Enter a fourth Novice. 4th Novice. I vow there is the same man again, coming in through the garden gate. 3rd Nun. The same again! Fearful! This must be looked to; I must see to this. [Exit. 1st Nun. We must all see to it, we that wear the veil. What is this hurry-skurry! Keep back, Novices; it is not for you . . . . Nay, young legs! They're all gone before one can cross oneself. [Exeunt. Enter the Lady Abbess and Father Renault. The Abbess. A woeful plight, poor sinner, woeful— yes— Poor Flos! I told her it would come to this. Poor soul! she never heeded me, no more Than had I been a magpie or a chough. Father Renault. That woeful is her plight I well believe, And hear with hope; the woefuller the better; So woe shall work to weal. The Abbess. Pray God it may! Pary God you bring it so to work! God grant it! But what it works to now is bad to worse. She hates him with a passion and a heat More senseless than she loved him with before; And take my word for 't—of a truth you may— I know her well, and she may sit and sulk And spare to speak, but well I know her thoughts— And take my word for 't she is dangerous; She's brooding, and there's somewhat will be hatch'd; And she has those—I say not who they be— At her behest who'll do a deed of blood For love or lucre; and what scandal then Should light upon this holy House and me And all of us. I pray you press it home; Enjoin her if she harbour in her soul Bad thoughts of malice and revenge, to speak, And bid her upon pain of her soul's death Put them away. Father Renault. Else shall she not be shriven. Go, summon her and send her to confession. By this example we may mark how swift The transformation whereby carnal love Is changed to carnal hate. I have heard it said, There is no haunt the viper more affects Than the forsaken bird's-nest. In the Chapel I shall await her; send her to me there. The Abbess. She's there already and expects you. Father Renault. Good. My part accomplished, it will then be yours To hold her well in hand. [Exit. The Abbess. So; gone at last. The Duke is late; or is he hiding? Oh! My gracious Lord! Enter Orleans. Orleans. Good Abbess, my good friend, Where is she? No—not here—nor coming? Nay, Is her thank-offering of yesterday, Her hand to kiss, the sum? The Abbess. My gracious Lord, That were but little. Orleans. Abbess, say you so? You think I ran some hazard of my life; It was not much; but by the Lord of Life If twenty lives were mine to put in pledge And on each life were twenty kingdoms staked, Laugh they that laughter love, that hand to kiss Should countervail them. The Abbess. Oh, my Lord, I blush To hear such things. Orleans. No need, good Abbess, none. I am not what I was. Her saintly grace Hath wrought a miracle and made of me, Whole sinner that I was, now half a saint. I think you scarce believe it, but 'tis true; That quest I told you of—that sacred quest Touching the king,—is all my errand now: Tell her for holy ends I humbly crave To be admitted to her presence. The Abbess. Nay, My gracious Lord, it pleases you to waive Your royal state; but it befits not me To be forgetful. She is near at hand: She shall attend you. Orleans. But no word, I pray, Of who or what I am. The Abbess. My gracious Lord, She does not, and she shall not, even surmise, If I can help it, till your Grace give leave, The honour that is hers. [Exit. Orleans. When soul meets soul I crave a riddance of my royalties. Save those that wear them, there are none can know The leaden hand they lay upon the hearts Of whosoe'er approaches, numb and dumb, That else were sprightly, fervent, fond and free. But wherefore do I wish her free and fond? And is it but the Devil's self within Assures me she has power to cast him out, So to betray us both? No, verily, Should the unholy ghost entice my soul From this its holy purpose, she herself Would rescue and redeem it. Enter Iolande. Fairest friend, Is it too soon I come again? Iolande. Too soon? Orleans. It would not seem so were my mission told. Have I seemed slow to tell it? Then believe 'Tis that I loved to linger in the joys That herald what is grave. Iolande. You speak of joys, And then you speak of that which is not joy. What else it is I know not; nor can I guess Why you, that have the splendours of the world (So thinks the Abbess) in your choice, should choose To haunt this dim retreat. Orleans. If dim it be, It's dimness is divine. In years long past I sought and found another dim retreat; And shall I tell you where? Iolande. Tell what you will. Orleans. Once in a midnight march—'twas when the war With Brittany broke out—tired with the din And tumult of the host, I left the road, And in the distant cloisters of a wood Dismounted and sat down. The untroubled moon Kept through the silent skies a cloudless course, And kiss'd and hallow'd with her tender light Young leaf and mossy trunk; and on the sward Black shadows slumber'd, softly counterchanged With silver bars. Majestic and serene, I said, is Nature's night, and what is Man's? Then from the secret heart of some recess Gush'd the sweet nocturns of that serious bird Whose love-note never sleeps. With glad surprise Her music thrill'd the bosom of the wood, And like an angel's message enter'd mine. Why wander back my thoughts to that night march? Can you divine? or must I tell you why? The worlds without this precinct and within Are to my heart,—the one the hurrying march With riot, outrage, ribaldry, and noise Insulting night,—the other, deep repose That listens only to a heaven-taught song And throbs with gentlest joy. Iolande. What march was that? Said you, the Breton War? You follow'd then The banner of the founder of this House, His Grace of Orleans. He is brave, they say, But wild of life, and though abounding oft In works of grace and penitence, yet as oft Lapsing to sin, and dangerous even to those His bounty shelter'd. Orleans. By his enemies All this is said, and more. Are you then one? Iolande. Nay, I know nothing save the gossiping tales That flit like bats about these convent walls Where twilight reigns. Gladly would I believe Our Founder faultless if I might; but you, Living in courts and camps, must know him well. Orleans. He is not faultless. Iolande. Are his faults as grave As tattling tongues relate? Orleans. They're grave enough. Iolande. Are you then to be number'd in the file Of the Duke's enemies? Orleans. Indeed I am: Not one has hurt him more. Iolande. What is your name? The Abbess vows—what I but scantly credit— She knows it not. May I not know it? No? She says you are of credit with the Court, And hope through certain ministries of ours With holy relics, to restore to health One whom the Founder loves. Orleans. Soon will you know Mine errand and my name; the last too soon; It is well known to calumny; when heard, It may be you will bid the gates be barred, And banish me your presence? Iolande. Never. No, If calumny assail you, much the more Be gratitude intent to do you right. That you are true and generous and brave Not all the falsehood all the world can forge Shall sunder from my faith. Orleans. Yet is there more. I said that calumny had soil'd my name, Which is a truth; but bitterer truth's behind; My life deserves not that my name stand clear; I claim but to be true; save loyalty Few gifts of grace are mine. Iolande. But you are young, And you will grow in grace. Orleans. It should be so; But hardly may I dare to say it will. I came upon a holy mission hither; Yet something but half holy in my heart Detains my tongue from telling it. Iolande. Your words Are strangely dark. I guess not what they mean And almost fear to ask. I know but little; Yet know that there are dangers in the world I have but heard of. May I trust in you? Oh that 'twere possible to trust in you With boundless and inalterable faith! Oh that 'twere possible to cast my soul On you as on the pillar of its strength! But you, too, you are weak; you say you are; And only God is strong, and in His strength And in none other strength may strength be found, And in His love and in none other love His child may win an unbewildering love, Love without danger, measureless content. Leave her to seek it there. Orleans. Oh, Iolande! I love you—yet to say so is a sin; And such a sin as only such a love And veriest inebriety of heart Can palliate or excuse. An earthly bond, Earthly as it was woven of earthly aims By heedless hands when I was but a child, Yet sacred as it binds me to a wife,— This earthly sacred bond forbids my soul To seek the holier and the heavenlier peace It might have found with you. Iolande. Go back, go back. I knew not you were married; back to your wife; Leave me—forget me—God will give me strength; There yet is time, for I am innocent still, And now each moment gathers guilt. Begone; Nor ever come again, nor ever again Wrong her you speak of, as you did but now In saying you love me. Orleans. Yet loving you I love not her the less,—surely not less; Nay with a pitying love I love her more; And pitying love shall have a heavenlier home. For even in the instant I beheld your face All that this glorious earth contains of good, As in a new creation, freshly, strangely, Reveal'd itself, borne in upon my soul; And since the mandate which created light And eyes not mortal then beheld God's works Not then defaced, no eye of man hath seen So fair an apparition as appear'd This earth to me. Iolande. Home to your wife,—go home. Your heart betrays itself and truth and me. You know not love, speaking of love for two. I knew not love till now; and love and shame Have flung themselves upon me both at once. One will be with me to my death I know; The other not an hour. Oh, brave and true And loyal as you are, from deadly wrong You rescued me, now rescue me from shame; For shame it is to hear you speak of love, And shame it is to answer you with tears That seem like softness: but my trust is this, That in myself I trust not,—nor in you, Save only if you trust yourself no more And fly from sin. Orleans. More precious to my soul Is your affiance, though with stern reserves, Than ever soft surrender wild to meet Love's wildest wish; nor will I longer dare, Uplifted by the rapture of the time Entrancing me from insight, to forget That what is heavenliest in our mortal moods Is not as fix'd and founded as the heavens. Yet do I dread to leave you, leaving thus My name the victim of all vile reports Which, when you hear it, you will hear. Iolande. No—no. The evil you have spoken of yourself I will believe, and not a breath beside. Orleans. I ask no more—no more—oh, nothing more; Not for one tone of that too tender voice, Not for one touch of that transparent hand; No, nothing for myself . . . Voices without. What! Iolande: Enter two Novices. 1st Novice. Oh! cry you mercy! Are you not alone? Iolande. You knew I was not. 2nd Novice. Well, perhaps we did; But 'tis no fault of ours, for we were sent. The Sisters want you in the Founder's chapel To deck the altar for St. Clement's Eve; And Father Renault tells us first and last None knows so well to twine the mimic flowers And Nature's broidery to counterfeit. 1st Novice. Old Sister Martha, mounting the ladder, tried, We handing up the flowers; but from her hold Thrice fell the fleur-de-lys; and she, poor soul! Was seized with trembling and would try no more. She said it was unlucky. Orleans. It was strange. 1st Novice. Yes, truly, Sir, it scared us. 2nd Novice. Worse ensued; For in her fright the ladder she o'erthrew, Which struck the Founder's banner in its fall, And that fell too. Orleans. That fell before its time; If ancient prophecy may win belief That should have waited for St. Clement's Eve. 2nd Novice. Sir, you say true. Come, Iolande; they wait. Iolande. I will be there anon. So tell them. [Exeunt the two Novices. Orleans. This I said, and I will say it once again, That for myself I ask nor word nor look That speaks of more than pardon. What remains Is but to name mine errand and begone. For one far worthier than myself I crave A boon that in the holiest human pity You may confer. A brother whom I love,— Whom all men love,—a treasure-house of weal For France and me,—in his behalf I ask What none but you can give. Sorely his soul Is wrung and tortured by the terrible power Of evil spirits, ever and anon Re-entering his body through the gaps Of faltering faith and intermitted prayer, When struggling nature wearied with the strife Yields a brief vantage. Iolande. He shall have my prayers; 'Twill be my sorrow's solace when you're gone To pray for one you love. Orleans. And did you know, In health how kind he is, how good and just, In anguish how unutterably tried, You'd pray with tears. Iolande. I never pray without; But they shall flow from deeper depths for him. Orleans. For prayers I ask—for prayers and something more. A vial is there in the Bernardins Which holds a relic of transcendant price, The tears of Mary Magdalene, let fall Then when she stood before the tomb of Christ Ere Christ appear'd; an Angel as they fell Caught them, and later gave them to St. John In Patmos; to St. Bernard from St. John Successive Saints devolved them; and such power Is theirs, that should a virgin whom no sin Nor sinful thought hath violated, dip Her finger in them, calling Christ to aid, And trace upon the brow of one possess'd The figure of the Cross, the unclean spirit Will instantly depart; and never more To one so fortified can fiend or imp Make good his entrance. Now you know what boon In what behalf I beg. Iolande. Am I the maid That may do this? Oh, would that I were worthy! But if no holier hath the call, then I, Beseeching God of His abounding grace To give sufficiency, will work in faith. Orleans. His blessing then upon your work and you! I will betake me to the Bernardins, Where is enshrined the relic. Once again, But in the hallowing presence of a rite More solemn than a service for the dead, We meet; and then, if so your conscience wills, We part for ever. Iolande. Once and no more. Orleans. Meanwhile The Lady Abbess will instruct you more Touching myself, my Brother, and the weight And import of your task. [Exit. Enter the Lady Abbess. Abbess. Well, pretty one; You know not yet what crown of honour . . . Yes, And worthily you wear it—here's a colour! I wonder if my cheeks will e'er again Glow like a meteor, and my dangerous eyes Throw out blue lights . . believe me once they could. Well! there's a time for all things! I protest You look so stately and so lifted up I think you know what Knight you have in hand; I think he told you. Iolande. No, dear Lady-Mother; Nor do I greatly care. How brave he is, How kind, how generous, how great of heart, I know—what care I for his name? Abbess. Good child, Say not you care not till you know. What, what! I will not tell you if you say you care not. Now do you care? Iolande. Yes, I believe I do. Who is he? Abbess. Louis, by the Grace of God Of Orleans, Valois, Blois, and Beaumont Duke, Count of Touraine! Hi! hi! Beshrew thy heart! The red blood ebbs amain; the fleur-de-lys Has beaten back the roses. Iolande. Oh! my Mother! Then he whose malady I am charged to cure,— He is the King! Oh Mother, yes, I know— “A treasure-house of weal to France and him;” He said to France. Mother, no hour shall fly, No minute that I shall not pass in prayer. Send for the Hermit; tell him in the chapel I shall be found. Abbess. Well, well, my child, I will. Scene IV. —Another Apartment in the Convent.—Flos de Flavy and Raiz de Vezelay. Flos. Talk not to me of love; I loathe its name More than blue plague or the unburied corse That none dares touch. Give me thy hand; I have it; But is it mine? De Vezelay. For ever and for ever! Flos. Mine for all work that I shall put it to? De Vezelay. In all submission thine. Flos. Now give me this; [Draws his dagger from its sheath. Thy dagger's haft is fashion'd to a cross, As though for handling by some Christian Knight Apt to avenge a woman. Vain pretence! Oh empty emblem! Out of date in France. What dagger now leaps lightly from its sheath Save in a tavern brawl? De Vezelay. Now by my soul You do us less than justice. Women's wrongs Find yet in France avengers. Flos. Is it so? Then swear upon this Cross to prove it so. Swear to avenge me, and be swift to strike— I say not whom, lest naming of his name My lips be wither'd and my human speech Turn'd to a serpent's hiss. De Vezelay. That do I swear; And by what's holiest in the heart of man I hold myself herein God's minister Of wrath and judgment, and your will as His. Flos. Give me thy hand again. It is too white. I dedicate this hand to truth and love, And hatred and revenge. White as mine own! Dye it and bring it back to me to-morrow, And I will clasp it to my heart. Farewell. Scene V. —The Council Chamber.—The King, the Duke of Orleans, the Duke of Burgundy, the Archbishop of Sens, and other councillors; the Bastard of Montargis, the Abbot of the Bernardins, the Captain of the King's Guard, and others in attendance. Orleans. The worthy Abbot here, my Lords, will vouch It has been tried a hundred times and more Nor e'er found wanting. Abbot. Never yet, my Lords. The last demoniac who was dispossess'd Was one from Vermandois,—a damsel plagued With many devils, that she raved and shriek'd And tore her clothes. A virgin of St. Cloud Dipping a finger sign'd her, whereupon A volley of blue sparks flew from her mouth, Then crows and winged serpents; and with that She dropp'd her arms and knelt, and praising God, Gave thanks for her deliverance like a lamb. Orleans. You hear. Since which she rests inviolate. Enough, Lord Abbot: we will weigh your words. [Exit the Abbot of the Bernardins. Burgundy. May it please your Majesty, I question not But that the tears shall work for good; they may; But this should hinder not that means be sought To track these devils home to them they serve; And these sagacious Monks, as I am told, Have now their noses on the slot. They wait To tell their tidings. Ho there! bring them in. [Exit Montargis. Orleans. For me, my Lords, as soon would I consult With Satan's self as with his mimes and minions; But since they please my Cousin, let them come. I think—what smell is this?—they're not far off. Re-enter Montargis with Father Buvulan and Father Betizac. Burgundy. Rise, holy Fathers; say to my Lord the King How speeds your quest? Archbishop. But first, I pray you, tell Whether it be by sorcery ye work, Or holier ways. Father Buvulan. My Lord Archbishop, no; 'Tis not by sorcery; but as Moses wrought His wonders, and by Jannes and by Jambres, Egyptians and Sorcerers, was misdeem'd To be a Sorcerer like themselves, so we By Sorcerers and their crew are Sorcerers call'd, But by the faithful faithful. For our art, We draw it from the holiest source, a book Which God to Adam for his solace gave When he had wept a hundred years for Abel. He that shall read this volume when the Moon Conjoins with Jupiter in the Dragon's head, Shall know of secret counsels that are hatch'd In Satan's kingdom. Orleans. In what language, Sir, Is this book written? Father Buvulan. That which was used, my Lord, In Paradise. Orleans. Who taught it you? Father Buvulan. My Lord, The Book I speak of teaches it. Burgundy. Well, well; To the purpose. Say, if ye know, what man Sends by his execrable art these fiends To vex the King, himself a fouler fiend Than any that obey him. Father Betizac. Honour'd Lords, We know, but dare not tell. Burgundy. How! dare not tell! How dare ye to be silent if ye know? Father Betizac. My Lord, so loth are we to deem it true, Although we know it, we would fain believe Our art this once betrays us. Burgundy. Tush! no words, Or words of weight; no trifling, Friars, here. Speak to the point, or take your hummings hence. Father Betizac. Oh, Sirs, but it is perilous to accuse Men in high places! 'twere an ill return For our outspoken fearless honesty Should we lie open to the vengeful strokes Of guilty greatness; and we humbly crave Some warrantise that what we're bid to speak Spoken shall bring no jeopardy of life Or liberty or goods. Burgundy. Now look ye, Friars; I've heard you heretofore with patience; yes, With singular patience, bred of that respect In which I hold you, so far I have heard you. But I am not a Saint; patience has bounds: And if ye do not instantly speak out, By God I'll have your heads. Father Buvulan. Ah! my good Lord, You deal too hardly with our just intent; But being so bidden we must needs obey Though it may cost us dear. My Lord, the man Who to our sorrowing insight was reveal'd The worker of this evil on the King Stands in this presence on the King's right hand, His Grace the Duke of Orleans. Orleans. Death and Hell! Ye felon Monks, accuse ye me? Archbishop. My Lords, This is plain blasphemy—these men blaspheme— My Lords, these men, I say these men, my Lords,— Orleans. These men, Archbishop? Venomous snakes, not men; Fell vipers hissing through the mask of Monks. Detestable Apostates, come ye here, Yea to the face and front of Majesty, To trample on the Royal blood of France! Rear up thy head, thou sacrilegious snake, Ope thy white lips and spit that lie again In the King's face. Archbishop. I say, my Lords, once more, These men profane this presence, speaking words That are most impious, and unfit to utter, And I may add, untrue, and very fearful, Transgressing and o'erleaping, so to say, Those bounds of modesty which good men honour, Insomuch that I verily stand amazed. Orleans. I say no more. I am ashamed to waste Good honest anger on a reptile's sting, Or scold at kites and jackdaws. Sir my Brother, I deign not to reply to this foul charge, But leave it to your justice. The King. They shall die, Yea, instantly, an ignominious death. Ho! Captain of the Guard, arrest these Monks. [The Guard is called in and the Monks pinioned. My ever loving and belovèd Brother, Who from our earliest years hast been to me A staff and stay,—my dear delight in weal, My solace in affliction,—be it known Who strikes at thy fair fame strikes at my heart, And as a traitor to the realm and me Shall suffer death. Father Betizac. Oh mercy! spare our lives! My honour'd Lord of Burgundy, save us, save us. Burgundy. I save you! Take them hence. Orleans. But first, a word; Of your own malice, though as deep as hell, Ye have not learnt this lesson. Tell from whom, Beside the Devil, ye derived it; tell, And I myself may plead for you. Father Buvulan. My Lord, You are most merciful and a Christian man. We were assured his Grace of Burgundy Knew more of this than we. Orleans. My cousin John! Burgundy. What, I, ye miscreant jugglers! Montargis. Take them hence— Off with them—off! and gag them, lest their lies Should spread amongst the people. Father Betizac. Base, false Knight! [The Monks are gagged and carried off. Burgundy. My royal Cousin, what has moved these Monks To mingle me with their malignities, I do protest I know not. Before God I am as innocent of this wrong to you As when my mother whelp'd me. The King. Doubt it not, My noble Brother. Think not that our Cousin, Who did but yesterday at the altar's foot, In token of a life-long good accord, Partake with you the Bread of Life and Love, Would ever so surrender his purged spirit To evil counsels as to soil himself With perfidies like these. Orleans. I well believe it; And do as freely from my heart absolve My Cousin of complicity in this,— Yea with a faith as absolute—as myself Of that I'm charged with. I would not believe A cat had stolen my cream upon the oath Of two such knaves as these; how should I then Believe for them my royal Cousin wrought To poison my good name? He did it not; No, by the honour of the Fleur de Lys, He did it not. My pledge I here renew Of friendship and alliance. Burgundy. And I mine; Here is my hand. Orleans. So be it. Now, my Lords, Our day's work thus determined, God be with you! With your good leave, my Brother. The King. Lords, farewell; Our Brother, as we think, will wish us with him. [Exeunt the King and the Duke of Orleans. Burgundy. I crave a word of counsel ere we part: We see, Sirs, how no week can pass but breeds Some new device for healing of the King; And what we now have witness'd proffers proof How easily in this good men may err, The dupes of knavish craft. Touching these tears, My cousin may be right or may be wrong; Certes his purpose and intent is good; But that his counsellors and instruments Are unimpeachable, demands a doubt: The Abbot of the Bernardins, I hear, Is but a wily and a slippery saint; And for my cousin's virgin, who but knows What manner of maids they be that trade with him. Then for the tears; there is another bottle, Shrined in the Convent of St. Genevieve, Which some think is the truer. How this be I know not; but I know it is not meet Such things be hazarded in wantonness; And to this end it is I ask your aid. I deem that whoso shall essay such things, If harm should follow, howsoe'er excused, Should expiate the issue with their lives. So rash attempts shall fitly be foreslowen, And none shall tamper with the King's disease Save those that in themselves and in their means Have a full faith. Hold up your hands for “Yea.” [All hands are holden up. It is decreed. I will not keep you now. Farewell. Montargis, stay with me. Farewell. [Exeunt all but the Duke of Burgundy and the Bastard of Montargis. Well, this is strange, Montargis; by St. George I nothing know what made those Monks so bold; They had no cue from me. Montargis. And by the Dragon I'll swear it was the truth that made them bold; For certain is it what they said was true; The King's bedevill'd by the Duke, no other; Men do not deal in dangerous crimes for nought, And who but he could profit? Burgundy. Who but he? Let but the King be kept incapable, He thinks to rule supreme. Montargis. And for what cause Saved he up Passac, whose infernal arts Compass the King from hour to hour? Burgundy. But why The Monks should be so desperate for the truth At forfeit of their heads . . . Montargis. That craves reply. Why true then,—let me see. Faith! they were stung At the Duke's meddling with their roast, the barber, And, taking count he would avenge him, reckon'd Their vengeance should have won the race of his. Burgundy. And when their reckonings ran them on a rock They hail'd to me, beshrew them! It is well My Cousin seems to think no evil. Montargis. Seems. Burgundy. Not honest, think'st thou, in his seeming? Montargis. Nay, Your Highness searches men with inquisition Subtler than mine. You're positive the Monks No warrant had from you. I that am bound To know you nice and scrupulous of speech, May swear to what you say. But who beside Will take it for a truth that men so mean And lowly of condition would thus dare To put their quarrel with a potent Prince To mortal issue, save at his behest Who only is more powerful still? 'Tis vain To dream the Duke, or any man, howe'er He mask the vengeful battery of his thoughts, Acquits you in his heart; 'tis not in man To hold you innocent; and if you deem The Duke so minded, you are lull'd to sleep, That so the dagger of a dire revenge May waken you to death. Burgundy. By Anthony's cap I swear I had no part in this at all, Nor knew of their intent. Montargis. Sir, 'tis all one; Part or no part, 'tis credited to you, And will be ever. Go not abroad, I pray, Unarm'd or unattended. Be advised; You are not safe. From this time forth you walk With pitfalls in your path. 'Tis you or he Must fall to rise no more. Burgundy. Well, I'll beware. Montargis. One vantage you may suck from what hath chanced. The Monks, thus dying for the word they spake, Will leave an echo in the people. These Will now misdoubt the Duke; and if mischance Should haply overtake him, some will say It was not undeserved. Let care be used To spread the accusation; taking note The Monks, as they were led to death, were gagg'd To stifle it. Bid waverers call to mind The dealings of the Duke in earlier years With Jean de Bar, and that enchanted ring Which still he wears, that gives him absolute sway O'er women, be they ne'er so chaste; which ring He scrupled not most impiously to employ Even in the Holy Week. Noise that abroad; And likewise that he hath a chamber, lock'd, Which none may enter, where the pictures hang By scores, of ladies o'er whose virtue thus He foully triumph'd. Burgundy. Truly, I have heard Of such a chamber. Montargis. More than heard have I, For I have seen it. Burgundy. Hast thou? By St. George Thou hast an entering art; how got'st thou in? Montargis. Sir, by the golden key; there is no lock Which that key fits not. To your Highness too Free entrance shall it open, would you view This zodiac of fallen stars. Burgundy. Some idle hour. But go, Montargis, see if the Monks be safe; And bring me word. I am but ill at ease; 'Twould comfort me to hear their heads were off. Scene VI. —Geoffrey de Laval and Eustace d'Estivet. Geoffrey. He bade me tell you he no longer needs That ditty destined for a serenade, Nor other amorous songs, how sweet soe'er, Your art can minister. If sing you must Still of love only, then he'd have you sing, Not of love's dalliance, rather what he deems, Thro' grace bestowed, not less but more divine, Love's dirge. Eustace. My boy, when boyhood's happy years Are past and gone, too aptly wilt thou learn That Love and Death are mates; for either love Dies in the living, or the living dies. Oh boy— Geoffrey. But I am older than you guess; You think, because my beard a little lags, That I know nought of love. Oh, but I do; And this I know,—if what you say of love Is true, and in the living love can die, Then rather would I that I died outright Than that the love which is my life should die And I should seem to live. Eustace. And may I know For whom it is that thou would'st die? Geoffrey. For whom? Well, there are two; his Highness is the one; The other is a maid, whose name is—no, I must not tell it. Eustace. Not to me? Dear youth; Thou'lt find not one that tenders more thy weal; God grant that if one day I sing a dirge, It may not be for thee. Geoffrey. God grant it—yes, Because my horoscope, his Highness says, Points to one hour with his. Eustace. Nay, is it so? Well, he that sings the dirge of love and joy Needs not to single out this hour or that; Still less that youth or maid. One song I sang, In other years, that touched upon that key, And if I could remember it . . . “I asked” . . . Geoffrey. You must—you must remember it. You shall. (Eustace sings). I asked a sweet Spirit above That looked on the earth with a sigh, What ails thee, oh Spirit of Love, And whence comes thy sorrow and why? As I looked, said the Spirit, it chanced Two lovers, a maid and a boy, Came before me, enraptured, entranced,— What I saw was the dayspring of joy. But if it was joy you descried, Why was there no joy in your face? 'Twas joy that you saw, and you sighed; Love's feast, and you could not say grace. He answered,—The near and the far For me come together in sight,— The beauty that shines like a star, The cloud and the blackness of night; Of friendship the Spring and the Fall, Love's glory that Shame overtook,— All visions of Hope, and through all Reality's bitter rebuke. 'Twas a bridal, and anthems were loud That pealed for the maid and the boy— But her veil was entwined with a shroud— What so sad as the dayspring of joy? Geoffrey. 'Tis well for them that have the art, like you, To put away their sadness into songs. 'Twas with a tender and a gracious grief The Spirit deigned to look on human woes; But had he not the solace of a sight That reaches farther than an earthly far And sees another dawn? Eustace. There—now I own A ripeness must be thine beyond thine years, And truly beyond mine; for I but sing, And thou art fain to preach. Geoffrey. Hark, hark! the chimes. One, two, three, four . . . the hour is come, and now,— If Iolande be steadfast, and the King, As hitherto, consenting,—shall be wrought The miracle of the tears. The Duke gave leave, And I can pass you through the chapel doors; But we must go at once and see unseen. ACT IV. Scene I. —The working-room of a Painter. The Bastard of Montargis and the Painter. Montargis. Well, Sir, these foolish women, as I said, Beset me for my picture—no escape; And if a hundred crowns may answer it, There is the gold; and being thus besieged, I hold my ransom cheap. Painter. The sum, my Lord, Has more relation to your quality Than my deserts. A side-face shall it be? Or no—a full face; for 'tis but in that The story of the face is told at large. The full face portraiture should much divulge, Aud yet much more adumbrate . . . . Turn to me . . . . It may be of one look alone delivered, And yet with many pregnant . . . . All but straight— Your pardon—so—A little more this way . . . There, there, I have it. For the scar, my Lord, Shall it be painted? Montargis. As you please. Painter. The scar Is portion of the story; it shall stand. So now to work. Montargis. Excuse me; not to-day; My leisure serves not; but some fortnight hence I'll come again. Whose face is that, I pray, That gleams from yonder panel? Painter. That, my Lord? It is her Grace of Burgundy's. Montargis. True—true; You told me so before—stolen as she sat Over the lists at Nêsle. Painter. Tis but a sketch, Yet of great price to me; for this, wrought out, Builds up the fortune of my piece in hand, Salomé in the hall of Herod. Montargis. Hah! That face befits the argument. The mole Upon the neck,—is that, as some aver, An added charm, or is it not a blemish? Painter. There is a power in beauty which subdues All accidents of Nature to itself. Aurora comes in clouds, and yet the cloud Dims not, but decks her beauty. Furthermore Whate'er shall single out a personal self Takes with a subtler magic. So of shape; Perfect proportion, like unclouded light, Is but a faultless model; small defect Conjoint with excellence, more moves and wins, Making the heavenly human. Montargis. For myself, Unto things heavenly am I devote, And not to moles and weals or humps and bumps. Yet I consent, her Grace of Burgundy Has charms, as you have painted them, that vie With any France can boast. Painter. 'Tis kind, my Lord, In you to say so; but I spared no pains. Look closer; mark the hyacinthine blue Of mazy veins irriguous, swelling here, There branching and so softening out of sight. Nor is it ill conceited. You may mark The timbrel drooping from her hand denotes The dance foregone; a fire is in her eye Which tells of triumph; and voluptuous grace Of motion is exchanged for rapturous rest. Montargis. 'Tis all exceeding good. I take my leave; And, you forbidding not, some fortnight hence I come again. Painter. At your command. Montargis. Good day. [Goes out, but returns. I have bethought me of a friend whose soul Lies in the hollow of her Grace's hand, Soft fluttering like a captured butterfly, To whom this picture were the very leaf That it would feast on. In his amorous eyes This portrait would be worth a thousand crowns. Trust it to me, I prithee, for one day, That I may show it to my friend. Painter. My Lord, So soon as it has stamp'd its effigy Upon that altar-piece I told you of, 'Tis yours to sell; and for a forward step So please you in the mean time, take and show it. Permit me to attend you. By your leave. Scene II. —The Chapel in the King's Palace. Iolande and Robert the Hermit. Robert (kneeling at the altar). Father, that throned in glory and in light O'erseest all things, and this Earth thy work In its first newness fresh from Thee survey'dst And saw'st that it was good, behold it now Old and adulterate with pain and sin And cursed with strife, whilst anguish and despair Cry piercingly, but not to Thee, for pity,— Behold it now a world of blood and tears: And as by power Thou mad'st it fair at first, So by Thy mercy, so by Thine infinite love, So by Thy heavenly washing, cleanse it now: Almighty Father, spare this realm of France: Father, this region, fairest of the earth Whilst Thou wast with us, wanting Thee is foul; And from its filth and rank corruption teem All loathsome, all unutterable crimes. Oh may the few that serve Thee serve Thee so That many may be saved! Visit this vine Which Thou didst plant and erewhile mad'st so strong; Visit thy royal husbandman King Charles, That, charged to tend it, he have Thee to aid, And fainting not, have power to chase and smite The wild boar breaking in. And if this Maid Be chosen of Thee, a vessel of Thy grace, Shower Thou Thy blessing on her high endeavour. [He rises. Maid, I adjure thee for the last time now If any breath of earthly passion dim Heaven's mirror in thy mind, renounce this rite; For as the blessing were beyond all price If thou and thine attempt indeed were bless'd, So deep were thy damnation if, through sin Of self-deceit, or frailty of the flesh, Or wavering faith, or human loves at war With heavenly, thou mad'st havock of this hope. Iolande. Hermit, I saw her; she was robed in white, With golden hair that glisten'd in the sun, And eyes that look'd in turn from me to Heaven And Heaven to me, compassionate and pure And radiant with celestial love and joy. “I am Saint Mary Magdalene,” she cried; And then, as though she caught the word from Christ,— “Forward to Zoar; faint not, look not back; If doubt assail thee, for that o'er thy soul The shadow of a sin hath fleeted, deem That doubt to be but devilish, and know That dear and sacred in the sight of God As innocence itself is blest contrition; Else why was I beloved, and whence this crown?” With that, the glory round her head shone forth With sevenfold lustre, and she vanish'd. Robert. See; The Duke, the King. Enter the King, the Duke of Orleans, The Abbot of the Bernardins, with the phial, and Passac. The King. Brother, I prithee bid the Sacristan Leave jangling of those bells. Orleans. I hear no bells; 'Tis but your fancy, Brother. I have heard The ear hath phantoms, like as hath the eye, And men hear sounds that are not. It is common. The King. True; once I thought my body was a church, My head the belfry; and you'd scarce believe What clangour and what swinging to and fro Went on, and how the belfry rock'd and reel'd, Till Death, the knock-kneed laggard, came to church; Then all was peace. Orleans. No more of that. Look, look,— There by the altar is that spotless maid On whom the sainted Magdalene drops anew Her tears of tenderest love, which, turn'd to balm, With potent touch shall heal and fortify This shaken yet majestic soul of France. Make no delay. The King. Oh Virgin fair and pure! Thou hast a goodly presence, and thy face Is like the face of one who longs for Christ And sees Him coming in the clouds with power; And now thou drawest near, thou'rt not of earth; For there's a glory round thee, and thine eyes Are as that Seraph's which I saw long since When God was good and gracious to my soul And sent me messages of love. Oh maid! I see a Heavenly message in thy face, And know thee more than human. Iolande. Royal Sir, It is a vision you behold, not me; I see it too; whichever way I look Is light and glory; for it fills the place, And angels' eyes meet mine. Robert. Let none gainsay That angels' eyes behold this work. Oh thou Redeem'd from sinful love by love divine, Who, weeping in the darkness nigh the tomb, Wast by the angels bidden not to mourn For Christ was risen, which heard thou went'st thy way With fear and with great joy,—teach us to weep In such wise that great joy may come through tears, Knowing Him risen: thou debtor unto whom Love brought forgiveness and forgiveness love Redounding each to other, ask for us That love and pardon our great debt demands: Thou who with tears didst wash the feet of Christ, Wash them again with tears,—wash them again With tears of intercession for the sins Of God's afflicted servant, Charles of France. The King. I know him—'tis the Hermit—he does well To clothe himself in skins. Brother, a word; It is not meet I undergo this rite In Royal robes; I should be humbly clad; I and the Hermit will change clothes. Orleans. Nay, nay, This is no time to linger; kneel as you are. Lord Abbot, place the phial on the altar. Now, sainted Iolande, beloved of God, Perform your hallow'd function. The King (kneeling). Be it so. Iolande. I, as divinely call'd, and by the grace I trust is given me, sign thee with this Cross; And by God's power, and by the Cross of Christ, And by the virtue of these sacred tears Wept by Saint Mary Magdalene, enjoin All evil spirits that inhabit here, If any now inhabit, to depart, And I command that none henceforth shall dare To vex the soul of this anointed King. Robert. Amen! amen! so be it! The King. There they go— That's Astramon,—that's Cedon; get ye hence, False traitors! My Lord Abbot, follow, follow; And sprinkle holy water in their track, Or they will turn again. Good Hermit, follow. [Exit followed by Robert the Hermit, the Abbot, and Passac. Iolande. Hear me, Angelic Host! Seraphic Bands, And Spirits that erst imprison'd here on earth Have burst your bonds and mounted, list to me, A child of earth, to whose weak hands were given The spear and shield of Christ,—oh bear me up Now that my task is done,—lift up my heart, For it is trembling, tottering, fainting, sinking, And teach it such a song of joy and praise As, borne aloft toward the mercy-seat, May mix with hallelujahs of your own! And oh that I were worthier, and that now, Upspringing from my consummated task, I might but be released and join your choirs In endless anthems! God of boundless love, Take me, oh take me hence! Re-enter Passac. Passac. My Lord, the King, As hath been sometime heretofore his wont, Hath bid us take away his sword. Orleans. Well, well; No matter; say no more. Passac. He calls for you. Orleans. I come. Oh, Iolande, a hasty vow Was that I vow'd, that when thy work was wrought I never more would ask to see thy face. Once, once again I must. Ere the sun set I bring thee tidings of the King. A cry within. My Lord; Orleans. I come, I come. Iolande. I fear you now no more; Christ hath me by the hand and I am safe. Orleans. Passac, attend her to the Celestines. Who calls so loud? I come, I say, I come. Scene III. —The Secret Cabinet in the Palace of the Duke of Orleans, hung round with Pictures, each concealed by a curtain. The Duke of Burgundy, the Bastard of Montargis, and an Attendant. Montargis (to the Attendant). Withdraw the curtains and retire. Burgundy. Too true; Wild as the winds, they tell me, wild as the winds. He knows not those about him nor himself; Son of Perdition, Scape-goat, Man of Sin, He calls himself, and foams at all who say “Your Grace,” “Your Highness,” or “my Lord the King.” No madman who believes himself a King Is so enamour'd of his royalties As this poor King envenom'd is against them. To see the Fleur de Lys most angers him, And when he can he tears it. One alone Hath power upon him (whence derived we know), The Milanese enchantress Valentine, My worthy Cousin's wife; who reads such books As when the hangman burns, he puts on gloves For fear of what may happen. In his rage He seized the old Archbishop by the throat, Bidding him cease philandering and fiddling And dig himself a grave beneath the gallows. The Archbishop, in a mortal terror, cried, “Oh let me go and I will do it;” then He squatted on the floor, and laugh'd. Montargis. This day, If ever, shall your Highness seize the reins. The people are inflamed; in every street They gather, hurling curses at his head Whose practice once again hath crazed the King. The death, too, they demand, of that young Witch Whose art the Duke hath used. Burgundy. That was decreed Beforehand. Montargis. Sir, a Council should be call'd Ere this cools down. Burgundy. Already it is call'd; It meets at six.—Ho! here's a galaxy Of glowing dames! Well done, my amorous Cousin! Whate'er his errors at the Council-board, By Becket's bones I cannot but commend His choice of paramours. Banners are these Ta'en in Love's warfare, and hung up to tell Of many a Noble, many a Knight despoil'd. Ha! were it not a frolic that should shake Grim Saturn's self with laughter, could we bring The husbands hither,—each to look round and spy The blazon of his dire disgrace. Montargis. 'Twere sport That were I following my father's hearse Would make me roar with merriment. Burgundy. Who's this? Tell me the name and quality of each In order as they come. Montargis. This is Adele, Wife of the Seneschal de Montenay. Beautiful vixen! for three years and more He caged her in his castle on the Yonne, To teach her tameness; and she learnt revenge; Whereof her present love is part and lot. Yond Cupid painted in the vault above Poison'd his arrow when he shot at her. She mimics gracefully a fondling softness, But there's less danger in a bear's embrace Than her caressings. Burgundy. God ha' mercy! Pass; Who is the next? Montargis. Evangeline St. Cler, The lily of Bordeaux, Count Raymond's daughter; An easy, lazy lady, freely fraught By nature with a full complacency And swelling opulence of inward joy Sufficient to itself, that knows no want, Too careless happy to have need of love. And leave her unmolested, she were chaste As Thekla in the cave; but urged and press'd, Resistance is too troublesome; she's kind, And if a lover wring his hands and weep, She can refuse him nothing. Burgundy. Weep for a wench! I'd have the fool well whipp'd. I know the next; She, if I err not, is De Chauny's spouse. Montargis. Pressing a portrait to her pouting lips, Which once were not so pale; and whence the change Ask her successor smiling opposite, The Jew Rispondi's daughter fresh from Rhodes. A polish'd corner of the Temple she, Dove's eyes within her locks; an innocent child, Sold as a toy and senseless as a toy, Who hardly knew what love or sin might mean. Her reign was short. Burgundy. And then the next! Montargis. Which! This? Burgundy. She with the timbrel dangling from her hand. Montargis. I know not this; this was not here before. The one beyond it . . . . Burgundy. Not so fast; this face I surely must have seen, though not, it may be, For some time past; it hath a princely grace And lavish liberty of eye and limb, With something of a soft seductiveness Which very strangely to my mind recalls The idle days of youth; that face I know, Yet know not whose it is. Montargis. Nor I, my Lord; Albeit the carriage of the neck and head Is such as I have somewhere seen. Burgundy. But where? Familiar seems it, though in foreign garb; And whether it be Memory recalls Or Fancy feigning Memory . . . Death of my soul! It is my wife. Montargis. Oh no, my Lord, no, no, It cannot be her Highness. Burgundy. Cannot, cannot— Why, no, it cannot; for my wife is chaste, And never did a breath of slander dim Her pure and spotless fame; no, no, it cannot; By all the Angels that keep watch above It cannot be my wife . . . and yet it is. I tell thee, Bastard of Montargis, this, This picture is the picture of my wife. Montargis. And I, my Lord, make answer it is not. I could as soon believe that Castaly Had issued into Styx. Besides, look here,— There is a mole upon the neck of this, Which is not on your wife's. Burgundy. That mole is hers; That mole convicts her. Montargis. What? a mole? Well,—yes, Now that I think of it, some sort of smirch,— A blot, a blur, I know not what . . . Burgundy. That mole. Oh see, Montargis, look at her; she smiles, But not on me,—but never more on me! Oh would to God that she had died the day That first I saw that smile and trusted her; Though knowing the whole world of women false, Still trusted her,—and knowing that of the false The fairest are the falsest, trusted still, Still trusted her—Oh my besotted soul! Trusted her only—oh my wife, my wife!— Believing that of all the Devil's brood That twist and spin and spawn upon this earth She was the single Saint—the one unfallen Of this accursed Creation—oh my wife! Oh the Iscariot kiss of those false lips! With him too—to be false with him—my bane, My blight from boyhood. Montargis. Verily therein Was foul-play worse befoul'd ; no arts but his, And theirs who taught him, with their rings and rods, Powders and potions, could have breach'd the wall Of that fair citadel. Burgundy. I'll have his blood. Montargis. My Lord, I do beseech you, be not rash. I own this is not at all points the place Where I could wish to find, hung up to view, A portrait of her Grace of Burgundy: But patience is a virtue which the times Demand of married men; to shout one's shame Were but to add to injury disgrace; Make not an open scandal; keep it close; Nor give to every mocking mountebank A theme for jest. Burgundy. No scandal; there's no need; But ere yon sun shall set, that villain dies. Montargis. 'Tis just he should; and, as the world wags now, There will be twenty triumph in his death For two that seem to mourn. Burgundy. He dies, by God! This hand shall kill him if none other. Montargis. Nay, Such handiwork should not become your Grace. Give me your warrant and the deed is done. Burgundy. Ere the sun sets. Montargis. A later hour were better; We want not daylight for a deed like this. Burgundy. I sleep not till he's dead. Come thou with me, And take thy warrant. Montargis. Sir, at your command. Burgundy. Look here, Montargis: [Drawing his sword. Should a breath be breathed That whispers of my shame, the end is this. [Stabs the portrait in the heart. ACT V. Scene I. —A Street. —De Vezelay meeting his Squire. De Vezelay. What of Montargis? Hast thou found his track? Squire. 'Twas dark ere I had reach'd the spot; but there I spied him; he was muffled in his cloak And skulk'd beneath a porch you'll find half way Betwixt the Celestines and Gate Barbette; It bears for sign the image of our Lady. I left Philippe to watch and came to tell. De Vezelay. Then there shall he be met with. Squire. He is arm'd. De Vezelay. Else could I not assail him. Should I fall, Take thou this token unto her thou knowest, And say I gladly would have lived to serve her, Wherein defeated, I as gladly die: Which ended, to my mother take this purse; It sums the wealth of Raiz de Vezelay. Scene II. —The Convent of the Celestines.—The Duke of Orleans and Iolande. Orleans. You knew not, Iolande, but I knew well, The import of that word which Passac brought,— “He bade us take away his sword.” Poor soul! So long as sense is with him he takes thought For all, and ever as the clouds within Speak to his spirit of a coming storm, Desires to be disarm'd. Iolande. Alas! Alas! Orleans. Take courage and take comfort; look not back; 'Tis that way darkness lies. God knows thy heart; He knows thou wrought'st devoutly and in faith, And though He grant thee not a Kingdom's health, 'Tis for the Kingdom's sins, and not thine own,— For mine and for the Kingdom's sins,—none else, That He denies thee; nor for these for long; Thy power, supernal even now in me, Through me shall work its way to purge the realm, And victory and peace shall yet be thine, Though now defeated. Forth then from the Past, And bid it get behind thee. Hope and joy Shall blossom from this ruin. Iolande. With joy and hope Let never more my name be named on earth. Wrought I in faith? But what then are the fruits? I wrought in sin, and shame is my reward. Orleans. Nay, never, never yet have sin or shame Stain'd thy resplendent soul, nor ever shall. One gift hath been refused thee, one reward, But thou art still Heaven's chosen child, and Heaven Is in thine eyes and lips and brow and voice; Nor even in the rapture of that rite Believed in through belief in Heaven's behest, Wert thou so like an Angel sent to save As in thine anguish now. If not the King, Yet surely me hast thou been sent to save, Nor wilt thou cast me,—oh! no, no, not now,— From that pure presence which is safety's self. Oh! say not now our paths must be apart; I could have borne,—I thought I could have borne,— To leave thee and to see thy face no more, Caught in a gust of triumph and of joy That swept thee out of sight; but as thou art Not Earth nor Hell shall part us. Iolande. Earth and Hell! It is for Heaven to part us. Earth and Hell Are closing round and pressing in upon us And shutting out the very sight of Heaven. Oh, leave me; I have told thee I am weak, Weak through the overthrow of faith and hope, Weak through the triumph of malignant Powers, And weak through what beside I will not say. But in the chambers of my soul, one light Still burns, and shows me, wildered though I be, That saving strength is found in self-distrust. If thou wouldst learn of me, learn that. Orleans. Oh God! But canst thou not believe . . . . I plead not now Nor ever will, though fifty fiends should rise And clutch in fury at their former prey, For aught but what is gracious and divine, Thy gracious guidance, thy divine support To rescue from their rage, not me alone, But many a million more; for France through me Is blasted and accursed, and her through me May'st thou redeem from darkness and from death, And ransom and assoil. 'Tis France that pleads. Iolande. Prince, tempt not me, nor tamper with thyself. Nor thou nor I are Saviours of mankind: They have another. Oh! in Him, not me, Seek grace and strength, and in His armour clad Go forth and conquer. No, not me, not me! For never was it meant when God array'd Thy spirit with a lustre more than man's That it should bend with less than manhood's might And seek support in me. Orleans. Oh, Iolande, Thy mandate if the demon dared dispute, That dare not I. The very ground thou tread'st Is holy; it is dedicated earth Which never more shall foot of mine profane. But wheresoe'er it journeys, ever there The vision of thy presence floating round Shall every path and every precinct guard, And he that was the slave of sense and sin Shall be thy soldier in the cause of Christ, Far from thee and yet near. Enter Flos de Flavy. Flos. Where is she? Iolande, oh fly! Begone! Take instant flight; a message has been brought From Raiz de Vezelay in fearful haste; The people clamour and the Council sits To judge thee; and no safety but in flight. Iolande. Great God! one Angel watcheth o'er me still, Sent by Thy pardoning love,—the Angel Death. Orleans. The Council sits to judge her! Who hath dared Without my summons to convene it? Flos. Sir, The people rage and say they will have blood. His Grace of Burgundy in Council sits, And, to appease them, he hath pledged his faith That judgment should be pass'd. Orleans. His Grace is mad; Or else 'tis in the dark he strikes, nor knows Why nor at whom. Fear not for Iolande; I'll to the Council instantly, and all Will then be right. My cousin and myself Are now in amity, and were we not, We ever have been, as we ever shall, Frank friends or open foes. All will be right. I'll tell them it is I shall answer this; For 'twas of my devising. Iolande. Oh! no, no; You shall not go; all was well done by you; The guilt was only mine. Orleans. Sweet Iolande, Your arms about me thus would once have strain'd The staunchest of my purposes—but now . . . [Breaks away. Robert the Hermit enters. Robert. Is this a time for clippings and embracings? Kneeling in prayer were meeter; know'st thou not What threatens thee, and hear'st thou not thy knell? Orleans. I know what threatens those that threaten her. [Exit. Flos. It is the people that I fear the most; They are as cruel as that dangerous Duke, And madder than their King. Robert. Unhappy maid, Haste thee to Sanctuary; a dreadful fate Awaits thee else. Iolande. Hermit, it is but death. Let me stay here. What death am I to die? Is it by fire? God grant it be by fire! For holiest men aforetime have so died. Oh Hermit! am I utterly unworthy To die like them? Robert. Maiden, the hand of God Hath written up thy sin. Thy fatal touch Polluted and depraved the inherent grace Of those most holy tears. Iolande. Oh 'tis most true; My guilt is great; the visions of the sense Beguiled my wandering soul, and I misdeem'd Fallen nature's ecstacies for grace divine. Robert. Look further for thy fault. How and whence came That treachery of the sense? the love of God Enamours not the sense, nor, being pure, Conspires with that, like losels o'er their cups, To inebriate the soul and so betray; For love of God the Father, God the Son, And God the Holy Ghost, comes not with heat, With seizure, transport, and with ravishment; Since these are wild and fugitive as the lights That dance and flicker o'er a new-fill'd grave, And where these are, there are the fumes of death And savour of corruption—amorous love Tainting the love of Christ. I saw even now Him that went hence reluctantly let go. Search thou thy heart; avoid the wrath of God; And that thou may'st avoid it, take thou heed, Nor brave in wantonness the wrath of man. It were presumptuous sin to court that death Which God in His great mercy and good time Grants or withholds. Flos. Yes, Iolande, oh yes; 'Tis tempting Providence to linger. Come. Iolande. Take me to Sanctuary. I will wait God's time. Scene III. —A Street. In front is the porch of a house, surmounted by an image of the Virgin. The Bastard of Montargis and Raoul de Rouvroy. De Rouvroy. This north wind bites. I am half sick with cold. Montargis. The night is chill; but something in my soul Dances and sparkles like yon frosty star. To watch for her I love or him I loathe Is better than a bed of down. De Rouvroy. God's life! I shall be frozen to the door-post soon; My dagger hand is numb. Montargis. Think of thy wrongs; Hast thou no spark of Hell-fire in thy heart To keep thee warm? De Rouvroy. This hanging by and waiting Is what I hate. Come but the work to hand, It warms me well. Hear'st thou? what noise is that? Montargis. 'Tis but a sheaf of snow slid from a roof. 'Tis vain to hearken for a tread to-night; Unless he come accompanied and talk, You'll see him ere you hear him. De Rouvroy. Hark! the chimes! Eight and three quarters. Montargis. Look, he comes! hide, hide. [They retire under the porch. Enter the Duke of Orleans and Geoffrey de Laval, his Page. Orleans. Now haste thee home, and bid the Seneschal Bring me swift muster of the men-at-arms Wherever I may be. Montargis. (springing from the porch, followed by De Rouvroy and others). That is in Hell. [Stabs him. Orleans. Ha! know ye whom ye strike? Villains, 'tis I, The Duke of Orleans. Montargis. The man we want. Orleans. I know thee not, nor whence thy grudge to me; But thou hast struck the life. [Falls. Montargis. And will again. [Aiming again at the Duke, whose Page, throwing himself on his master, is stabbed and dies. Montargis. Fool, what thy master needed not is thine. He hath enough. De Rouvroy. What! is he dead? Make sure. Montargis. Look in the gutter; full of blood he was; But if that drain him not . . . Fly for your lives! There's some one comes. [Exeunt Montargis and his gang. Enter De Vezelay and his Squire. De Vezelay. What horrible sight is this! The Duke! the Duke! Orleans. (raising himself.) And who art thou? Is't not De Vezelay? Not many minutes have I left of life, De Vezelay— [Seeing the body of his Page. Alas! poor faithful boy! And couldst not thou be spared! De Vezelay, Lift me and take me to the Celestines Alive or dead. Despatch thee. If God will I fain would reach the Celestines alive. [Faints. De Vezelay. (assisted by his Squire, takes up the Duke). Accursed be my feet that came too late, My hand, that could not find a time to strike Ere this was acted. Bastard! man of blood! 'Tis thou, 'tis thou that didst this murder. So! Swiftly, but smoothly, to the Celestines. Scene IV. —The Council Chamber. The Dukes of Burgundy, Bourbon, and Berri, the titular King of Sicily, and divers high Functionaries and Officers of State. Burgundy. I will be sworn, my Lords, the Duke my Cousin Can clear himself of this. The people fume, And rub again old rancours, and in chief That satyr's dance, when, as by miracle, Of five that from his Brother's torch took fire, Masking in garbs of tow, and burn'd to death, The King alone escaped, thanks be to God! They murmur, too, of Passac's rescue, wrought, As they misdeem, in malice to the King; Whence they, by evil inference, charge the Duke That he design'd the present woe. For me, I hold him innocent, though much misled. Bourbon. Good Nephew, for the witchcraft let the witch Be answerable singly; mix not up His name with hers. Berri. When she hath smelt the fire, Doubt not the people shall be pacified. Burgundy. Clerk, is the warrant ready? Clerk. Here, so please you. [As he signs the warrant, enters Montargis, who whispers in his ear. Burgundy. And next, my Lords, the testy time consider'd, Behoves us to take order with all speed Touching the Regency. My Cousin's claim Stands first. I marvel that he is not here; I scarce can think the city so incensed But he might find his way in safety hither. Yet, though he slights us, let it not be said His absence slurr'd his rights. The vulgar voice Is loud against him; but what skills it? Noise Shall never fright prescription from its course, Nor shall a puff of popular discontent Move ordinance aside. [Shouting is heard in the streets. Berri. What cries be these? Burgundy Know'st thou, Montargis? Montargis. Sir, the citizens Demand the death of that young Sorceress Who practised on the King. Burgundy. There is her doom. [Gives him the warrant. See thou the citizens be satisfied; Their urgency is just. [Exit Montargis. Bourbon. But hark again! I seem to hear an uproar here within, A hideous shrieking. Enter the King's Chamberlain. Chamberlain. Oh, my Lords! my Lords! A treason—such a treason—such a deed— A deed so barbarous, all the world's despite Can never match it, hath been done—Oh God! So black a treason . . . Burgundy. What, upon the King! Chamberlain. Not on the King, my Lord,—the Duke —the Duke— His Grace of Orleans. Burgundy. God in heaven forefend! What hath befallen him? Chamberlain. Dead, dead, my Lord: Most foully murder'd. Burgundy. My sweet Cousin dead! Chamberlain. Stabb'd in the street as he was hastening hither: Scantily attended and unarm'd. Berri. Stabb'd dead! Sicily. Merciful Heaven! Whose monstrous deed is this? Bourbon. Oh God, Thy hand is heavy on this realm! When will the measure of Thy wrath be full, And horrible portents cease? Sicily. Who did it? Who? Who did this murder? Burgundy. Ay, Sir, speak; who did it? Chamberlain. I know not who, but they are more than one, And running different ways. Berri. Send for the Provost! Set double guards upon the city gates, And let none pass. Chamberlain. The Provost is astir And the whole city in the streets. The gates Are closely guarded, and 'twas seen by some Whither the murderers fled. With these for guides The Provost tracks them. Bourbon. Nephew, are you ill? Burgundy. Ill? No! who says I'm ill? Bourbon. You're deadly pale. Burgundy. Who can abide so terrible a blow And keep the crimson in his cheeks? Who's safe, If thus the very gutters of our streets Run with the blood of Princes? Who's secure? Which of us next? Send for the Provost. Berri. Nay, It were but hindering him to call him hither; He's hot upon the quest. Burgundy. Then God forbid That we should hinder him. Berri. Why lo! he's here. Enter the Provost of Paris. Sicily. Speak; hast thou found them? Hast thou found the fiends That did this execrable deed? Provost. My Lords, Some of their number tried the Gate Barbette, But found it shut? Berri. And whither fled they then? Provost. I think, my Lords, I know; and might I search Whose house I will, high, low, or rich or poor, Or though the noblest in the city, then I'll stake my head these traitors shall be caught. Bourbon. Search where thou wilt; in Paris none, thou know'st, May dare to shut his door against the Provost, Save only Princes of the Blood. Provost. My Lords, The powers I crave are such as bear no note Of reservation. Bourbon. Take them to the full. What say ye, my good Brothers and my Cousin? Sicily. All privilege push'd by, break every bar That stays thee. Berri. Even as we would ourselves; Hut, hovel, royal palace, all alike, Enter and search. Burgundy. Nay, hold ye there. For me, I'll have no nuzzling catchpole cross my door, As though misdoubting that a royal roof Should harbour cut-throats. Bourbon Cousin! Provost. In your hands, My Lords, I place my office. 'Tis for you To do your pleasure. Berri. Nephew, should thy door Be solely barr'd, when all stand open else, There were a second slaughter done this day, And thy good name the victim. Sicily. By God's death, I would myself impeach thee. And behold! I see thy plain impeachment in thy face; And if thy Cousin's ghost should rise before thee And say thou didst it, I were not more sure Of thy most damnable guilt; and with my sword I'll probe and search and prove it. Burgundy. Spare thy threats, Good Uncle. It was I that did this deed. Bourbon. Too well I knew it from the first. Sicily. And I. Berri. And dar'st thou say thou didst it, thou that satt'st Pledging him at my board but yesternight, And with him at Christ's table didst partake A pledge more sacred still? Dar'st say 'twas thou! Sicily. Oh shame to knighthood and our Royal House! Pluck from thy miscreant crest the Fleur de Lys And stick the deadly hellebore in its place; For from this hour attainted is thy blood, And from the Royal Tree of France thy branch Is lopp'd and on a dunghill cast to rot With all that's base and abject. Hence! begone! Get hence, or I will spurn thee with my foot And push thee out of door. Burgundy. Beware, good Sirs, The day we meet again. [Exit. Sicily. Pursue him, Provost, Arrest him. Berri. Be not hasty. First take note Which way the people tend. Bourbon. Tis well advised; Let's muster each of us our several guards And draw them to a head; the people else May turn upon us. Sicily. Then why sit we here? Up and be doing! for each minute lost May give him wings to fly. Get we to horse. Scene V. —The Convent of the Celestines.—Iolande kneeling beside the body of the Duke of Orleans. In front Raiz de Vezelay and Flos de Flavy. Flos. She hears us not. Vex not her ears with words; They do no good. De Vezelay. But if she linger here Her death is sure. Flos. Thou know'st her not; I do; She will not fly. De Vezelay. Alas, then she is lost! Flos. Her soul is hardly with her. 'Tis with his. Since she took water and with her kerchief wash'd The blood-stains from his face, she hath not stirr'd. How grand he looks! Death's grandeur and his own. Iolande. Not cold—not yet. De Vezelay. Did she not speak? Flos. To us? No, not to us. Iolande. (springs to her feet). Great God! Look there, look there! The blood is gushing freely from the wound. De Vezelay. Then is the murderer near. Enter the Bastard of Montargis. Montargis. (affecting to start back). Oh piteous sight! Oh woeful spectacle! What, lies he there,— He that was yesterday so bold and gay! At this even they that loved him not would weep, And how should I forbear? Iolande. Assassin, hence! Profane not thou the presence of this corse, Lest it arise and slay thee. Felon, hence! Montargis. What! charge you me with this unhappy deed? And call you me a murderer? Flos. Yea, she doth. Montargis. Ha! doth she truly? she is ill advised. Her pardon should I weigh but at its worth The charge of one, who, if I read aright The warrant in my hand, herself is charged With deeds more terrible than she lays on me; Foul witchcraft link'd with treason; for which crimes I come, as by this warrant is commanded, To take her to her doom. Flos. Fell miscreant, hold; Approach her not. Montargis. Stand from me, or by Heaven I'll shake thee from my path. De Vezelay. False child of Hell, Home to thy dam! [Stabs him, and he falls. Montargis. Perfidious Raiz, why this? I never did thee wrong. De Vezelay. For all mankind, Whom thou hast wrong'd in putting on the mask Of manhood who wast born and bred a fiend, I take this vengeance. Enter the Provost of Paris followed by Officers of Justice. Provost. What new gap for life Is open'd here? More blood? Without, within, In streets and houses, ay in churches too, Rage violence and slaughter, and this night The very skies rain blood. [Turning to the body of the Duke of Orleans. Unhappy Prince! I honour'd thee in life, and do I now Forget to do thee reverence!—Ha! by Heaven, Unless mine eyes play false, this writhing wretch Is he whose malice slew thee, and my zeal, Though hasting, is belated. Say, whose hand Was his that balk'd the headsman of his due And laid this traitor low? De Vezelay. That hand was mine. Provost. I blame thee not, but would not he should die Till he be question'd at the Châtelet; The rack shall bring some hidden truths to light Which else were buried with him. Montargis. I appeal From them that sent thee to my Sovereign Lord, His Grace of Burgundy. Provost. Appeal to him! His Grace hath fled the city. Montargis. Fled! So— Well— Take thou my body; for the breath that's in't, Beware that it take wing not by the way, For now it flutters even as for a flight More distant than the Duke's. Provost. (to the Officers). Sirs, take him hence. Montargis. One moment, Sirs, I pray you. Ere I go, Fain with this lady would I make my peace. My purpose was that she should share my flight, And of this warrant I possess'd myself To save her, not to harm. This to attest Behold what's here,—the hand and seal of Death. Iolande. Make thou thy peace with God, and not with me; For in God's court and presence we shall stand, Both thou and I, this night. Provost. Sirs, we lose time; I say, convey him hence. [Exeunt the Provost and his Officers, with Montargis. Clamour and tumult is heard without, and enter Robert the Hermit. Robert. Oh haste thee, haste! A rolling mass of fury comes this way; Fly by the wicket: Raiz de Vezelay, Attend her, I beseech thee; I, the while, Will from the window speak to them, and strive To stem the torrent. Iolande. Hermit, it is I Must speak, and vindicate the fame of him Whose lips are silent. [She advances to the window, is struck by an arrow shot from the crowd, and falls. At the same time the doors are forced and the crowd appears, but pauses at the sight of the Duke's body and of Iolande fallen. Hermit, I am slain; And that is well. Christ will receive my soul, Knowing that though I fondly loved another, I strove to love but Him. That other too Christ will receive; for if he sorely sinn'd, Deep was his penitence and large his love. I seem to see the Citizens at the door, But now mine eyes wax dim,—or else my mind,— And all things swim and glimmer. Cease, dear Flos, Thou vainly striv'st to staunch it; let it flow. I see more clearly now. Ye that love truth, And of these fearful miserable days Would justly judge, accuse not in blind wrath Him that lies there, whose true and generous soul Was faithful to the King. 'Twas mine, 'Twas mine, The fault was mine, that though I work'd in faith And sought the King's deliverance, all was vain Being I was not worthy. Lo! I die, And bless the hand from which this arrow flew, And ask forgiveness, first of God, and next Of you, the People. Free among the dead. [Dies. Robert. Back, Citizens; that which ye sought ye have; Though now methinks ye would ye had it not; And some are weeping. Hie ye to your homes. [The people retire. He turns to Flos and De Vezelay. Arise, if horror have not stark'd your limbs, And bear we to the Chapel reverently These poor remains. In her a fire is quench'd That burn'd too bright, with either ardour fed, Divine and human. In the grave with him I bury hope; for France from this time forth Is but a battle-field, where crime with crime, Vengeance with vengeance grapples; till one sword Shall smite the neck whence grow the hundred heads, And one dread mace, weighted with force and fraud, Shall stun this nation to a dismal peace. TO THE AUTHOR'S WIFE. Dear Alice, through much mockery of yours (Impatient of my labours long and slow And small results that I made haste to show From time to time), you scornfullest of reviewers, These verses work'd their way: “Get on, get on,” Was mostly my encouragement: But I Dead to all spurring kept my pace foregone And long had learnt all laughter to defy. I thought, moreover, that your laugh (for hard Would be the portion of the hapless Bard Who found not in each comment, grave or gay, Some flattering unction) . . . In your laugh, I say, A subtle something glimmer'd; 'twas a laugh, If half of mockery, yet of pleasure half. And since, on looking round, I know not who Will greet my offering with as good a grace And in their favour give it half a place, These flights, for fault of better, short and few, Dear Alice, I must dedicate to you. Mortlake, Nov., 1847. THE EVE OF THE CONQUEST. A cloudy night descended on the slopes Of Mountfield, and the scatter'd woods beyond, Where lay the Saxon force; and now the wind, Till sunset that had seem'd to hold its breath, Burst forth in gusts and flaws, the sea far off Sounding a dirge a day before the time. A flush of light was in the Southern sky, Cast from the Norman camp, and more remote At intervals around, from Lunsford-heath To Broad-oak-cross, and Udimore to Hooe, The frequent watchfire glimmer'd, where the boors, Though scared yet greedy, grimly lurk'd aloof, Expecting plunder when to-morrow's storm Should leave the wreck of battle on the plain. So fell the night. Upon the Saxon flank A forest stood, within whose wavering skirt Was scoop'd a shelter for King Harold's tent; And thither, when the fitful wind was lull'd, Came sounds of jollity and boisterous songs, Which did not please the King.—“Leofwyn, Brand, Go bid the chiefs abate this barbarous mirth, And counsel them that cannot sleep to pray.” They went, and shortly there was silence. Then The King composed himself as seeking rest: But though his limbs were motionless, the Page Who watch'd him, noted that his eyes were closed More fast than if in sleep, and that his lips Were ever and anon compress'd to curb A quivering movement. Suddenly he rose, And shouted for the Page—but he was there. “Go, Ina, ere the night waste further, go, And bring me from the Convent where she sleeps Edith, my daughter; I would hold discourse With her of former days; and wanting this My soul is not consenting to repose.” So Ina through the tangled thickets ran, Much carping at the absence of the Moon, And doubting in the darkness lest his speed Through misdirection should induce delay. But soon he reach'd the Convent in the groves Of Penshurst, now the shield of Harold's house, Long after to be otherwise renown'd. “Sleeps she, the Lady Edith?” “No,” they said, “Nor will she be persuaded; she is now At nocturns in the Chapel.” Thither he: But ere his entrance had the service ceased. She knelt upon the altar steps alone In mourning loosely clad, with naked arms That made an ivory cross upon her breast. She mourn'd and pray'd for that revolted Earl, Her uncle Tostig, he that fell at York A month before, in arms with aliens join'd, In overthrow with that Norwegian King Who gat from Harold what, when terms were named, The Saxon proffer'd with abrupt disdain— “Six feet of ground,—or seven, for he was tall.” She mourn'd her uncle, spite of his revolt, Because she loved the stock whereof she came, And knew them noble even when most misled. “The King would see you, Princess, ere he sleeps, For he is troubled in his mind.” She rose, And rising seem'd the vision of a Saint, Awaiting her assumption. In her mien Celestial beauty reign'd with sovran grace And holy peace which holier raptures left, Not colourless, but like a sunset sky, Partaking of their glories. So she rose; And bending as once more she cross'd herself, Went forth in haste though calm. By shorter paths, For they were known to her, she led the way, By garth and croft, and through the ferny brake, And o'er the stepping-stones that spann'd the stream, And where the deer-browsed elms in Penshurst Park Spread o'er the sward their level circular roofs: And nimbly now, and with less doubtful speed Than Ina's by the parting ways perplex'd, They reach the forest in whose wavering skirt Was scoop'd a shelter for King Harold's tent. Meanwhile the King sate brooding, deep in thought; Nor, save for mandates needful to be given As notices were brought from spies and scouts, Had raised his forehead from his folded hands: The time was tedious to the troubled King. At length the imbedded floor of tough beech leaves, Slow to rejoin the dust from which they came, Return'd the tremulous pressure of a foot So light and soft the Woodland Genius Mistook it for an echo of the steps By Oreads planted there in days of old. Then Harold, rising as the Princess knelt, Threw off the cloud that veil'd him, and appear'd His very self, a man of godlike mould, Radiant, but grave.—The greeting o'er, he sat Upon a rough-hewn couch with rushes strown; And she upon a mantle at his feet Half sat, half lay, her face upturn'd to his, Hands clasp'd across his knee. Then spake the King:— “Since sunset, when the marshalling of the force Was ended, in this dark nocturnal void The Past has come upon me. Should I fall To-morrow, I shall leave behind me few,— It may be none,—to tell with friendly truth My tale to after-times. Of those that now Surround me, and have battled by my side In former fields, too many are estranged Through love of lucre, seeing I withheld The spoil of that rich victory in the North, To spare my people, ravaged by the wars: These, if surviving me, shall bear me hard. The many, for whose dear behoof I lose The suffrage of the few, are slow to praise A fallen friend, or vindicate defeat. To-day the idol am I of their loves; But should I be to-morrow a dead man, My memory, were it spotless as the robes That wrapp'd the Angels in the Sepulchre, Should see corruption. Therefore in the ear Of one whom Nature destines to outlive, If God should so see good, my mortal term Arriving soon or late, I fain would leave Some notice of those things wherein I err'd, And those wherein they err that taint my fame. Thy brethren tend their charges or repair Their strength in sleep; but thou art wise to know, And lov'st to hearken. So long as thou liv'st, Of what I tell do thou thy memory make A living record; and before thou diest, Unmix'd with lies and flatteries, in the book Wherein the Saxon Kings are chronicled, See it be written.” With a wistful gaze The Princess waited while her sire revolved The matters he would speak of. More than once She press'd her lips upon the massive hand That lay beside her, rough and weather-stain'd; Then gazed again. He knew not what she did: His thoughts were travelling into distant times. At length they wrought to utterance:— “In my youth How gaily deck'd, how fortunately fair, My life before me lay! My father then Had graciously and of his bounty given The crown to Edward, his obsequious King. I ruled in Kent, and held through him such power, That justice, which the people long had ceased To dream of and forgotten to be due, Was feasible; and mercy, which had seem'd A gift reserved to God, was mine to grant. So love flow'd on me from a thousand springs And pour'd itself around me like a flood. I flourish'd as a bay tree. By my side A noble brotherhood of six fair youths Grew lustily, my father's younger sons; Of whom, with loyal and fraternal faith, Four have still follow'd me through chance and change Inalterable; two have pass'd from earth And stand before their Judge: I judge them not. Last of the six in order, first in love, Was Ulnoth, in the beauty of his prime, Who seem'd a creature sent by God to fill The world with love. A goodlier sight this earth Beheld not in its goodliest golden days. A frank and friendly joy adorn'd his face, Exuberant, but in its wildest mood Forgetful of no courtesy nor grace Of generous kindness, dealt to high and low Like rain and sunshine, profluent from the heart, With no respect of persons, a good-will That could not be contain'd. Ulnoth I loved Next to thy mother, Edith, while she lived; And when her spirit, purified by pain Whilst here abiding, was translated hence, I loved him of the living best. That love I to this hour rejoice in and retain, Not deeming what it cost me worth a sigh. Thus in the earlier years of Edward's reign Well fared my father's house. But joy is short; And soon upon our glorious break of day, So rich in sunshine and so fresh with dew, We saw the darkness gather on that side Whence now the storm assails us. Normans soon Began to flock to impotent Edward's court; Who, in his wily weakness, whilst he shower'd His favours on our house, yet hated most (A customary baseness in the weak) Him to whom most he owed, and sought to sap My father's fortunes when he seem'd to build. The Norman courtiers, who could dance and sing Or fast and pray at pleasure, worm'd their way, And quickening the dull hatreds that they found, Pour'd very poison in King Edward's ears. By falsehood they prevail'd; nor less by truth. They told him, which was true, that we despised His person and his power: they said besides We practised to overturn the tottering throne That now we overshadow'd; which was false. But whatsoe'er shall furnish pleas for fear Finds credit with a coward, and the King, Believing all they bid him, strove to bate Our formidable fortunes, and to lift His foreign minions into power. They thence Took courage whom they injured to insult; And Eustace Count of Boulogne, on his way To France by Dover, with such desperate pride Demean'd himself, the townsmen rose in arms, And I, who ruled the seaboard, was constrain'd To drive him back. The King's accustom'd fear Was startled into anger, and he bade My father and myself appear forthwith Before the Witena. We raised a force: But then my father falter'd, and the King Propounding terms, a compact, to my heart Most grievous, was concluded; from which seed Sprang mostly my misfortunes and my faults. For Ulnoth as a hostage was consign'd For surer custody to William's hands, This Norman Duke. Ere long my father died; And Edward's dread and hatred of our house Relenting, for 'twas he had scared him most, I grew in greatness; and the wars in Wales— Which country 'twas my fortune to reduce To unaccustom'd tameness—and with these, Earl Alfgar's insurrection—which, though fierce, I quell'd by force and heal'd by clemency— Exalted my renown, and to my zeal Experience added; and as Edward's health Went yearly more to waste, the people's voice Design'd me for the throne. My path seem'd straight At home, but I foresaw that foreign leagues, And strife and envy, should confront my steps When once afoot; and knowing this I knew What dangers should arise to Ulnoth then, If he were then still caged in William's court. For though the Norman had not yet divulged His own preposterous claims, yet him I knew With all my foreign foes confederate. Wherefore, or e'er the stirring time should come, 'Twas my first care to compass the release Of Ulnoth. To my instances the King Made answer still that William, and not he, Detain'd him; but in truth he greatly grudged This mainprize of my loyalty to let loose. To William thus remitted, I resolved To him to go; which doubtless pleased the King, As privy to the Duke's audacious schemes, Nor loth that I should stumble on his toils. “Through divers dangers, shipwreck first, and next Captivity, I reach'd the Norman court. Right joyful was that day. The politic Duke Received me with all honours short of those To sovereign Princes paid. Procession, game, Banquet and dance, with songs of every strain, Lays, virelays, delays, and roundelays, A fortnight of festivities fill'd out. But festive beyond all that song or dance Could publish of festivity, to me Was Ulnoth's face,—fulfill'd of all delight, That seem'd to lavish like a miser's heir Its hoard of joy. The meanest of the train That follow'd at my father's heels or mine In former days, appearing to him now, Even as a brother would have welcomed been: What welcome then was mine!—of all his race The one who loved him best, whom best he loved, Through dangers to his house of bondage come, And haply his deliverance to achieve. From treating with the Duke I held aloof Till I should see and learn: with Ulnoth still Delighting to consume the livelong day, Associate in the chase, or as he list, In groves and gardens, regally adorn'd With fountains and with daintiest flowers, nor less With frequent gleam of damsels, thither brought By choice or chance, or choice attending chance, In throngs or sole, that many a chaplet twined, And chaunted many a lay. Of these the first In station and most eminently fair, Was Adeliza, daughter of the Duke. A woman-child she was: but womanhood By gradual afflux on her childhood gain'd, And like a tide that up a river steals And reaches to a lilied bank, began To lift up life beneath her. As a child She still was simple,—rather, shall I say, More simple than a child, as being lost In deeper admirations and desires. The roseate richness of her childish bloom Remain'd, but by inconstancies and change Referr'd itself to sources passion-swept. Such had I seen her as I pass'd the gates Of Rouen, in procession, on the day I landed, when a shower of roses fell Upon my head, and looking up I saw The fingers which had scatter'd them half spread Forgetful, and the forward-leaning face Intently fix'd and glowing, but methought More serious than it ought to be, so young And midmost in a show. From time to time Thenceforth I felt, although I met them not, The visitation of those serious eyes, The ardours of that face toward me turn'd. These long I understood not; for I knew That she in fast companionship had lived With Ulnoth; and albeit his joy and pride Had been in eloquent speech to magnify My deeds, insomuch that the twain had lived And revell'd in my story, yet I deem'd That she must needs have prized beyond the theme The voice that graced it: and contrasting now My darkening days with Ulnoth's gracious prime, I scarce could bring myself to think that eyes, Howe'er by fancy misinform'd, could err From him to me. But Ulnoth was a boy When first she knew him, nor was yet renown'd: And woman's fancy is more quick to read In furrow'd faces histories of wars And tales of wonders by the lamp of fame, Than in the cursive characters of youth, How fair soever written, to descry A glorious promise. Thus betwixt these twain A bud that might have blossom'd into love Was sever'd ere it set. For Ulnoth's part, He, in his nature buoyant, lightly held By all his loves save that he bare to me; And lightly, with a joyful pride, he saw Her heart to me surrender'd, and himself Of some unsettled moiety disseised. Such shape to him the matter took. For me, Her excellence of beauty, and regards Rapt oftentimes, forgetful of the earth, Of earthly attributions unaware In him her fancy glorified,—regards That seem'd of power to make the Heaven they sought,— Did doubtless touch what time, and public cares, And household griefs, had left me of a heart. I loved the lady with a grateful love, Tender and pure, not passionate. Meantime, I search'd the Duke, and saw myself by him With subtlest inquisition search'd in turn. His eye was cold and cruel, yet at times It flash'd with merriment; his bearing bold, And save when he had purposes in hand, Reckless of those around him, insomuch He scarce would seem to know that they were there: Yet was he not devoid of courtly arts; And when he wish'd to win, or if it chanced Some humour of amenity came o'er him, He could be bland, attractive, frankly gay, Insidiously soft; but aye beneath Was fire which, whether by cold ashes screen'd, Or lambent flames that lick'd whom at a word They might devour, was unextinguish'd still. “It chanced he had a quarrel now afoot With Conan, Count of Bretagne, against whom He took the field. I gladly with him went For exercise in arms, and gave what aid I could in council. But the more he found In me of succour and resource, the more A jealous care possess'd him. Not the less He courted and cajoled me, costliest gifts Conferring with a light and lavish hand. My suit for Ulnoth's liberty at once He granted; and, of all he had to give The prime of gifts most precious in his eyes, His daughter Adeliza, in his heart He plainly purposed then, if all went well, To proffer. Her from cradled infancy He carried with him wheresoe'er he went By land or sea, in peace or war, and now In camp or town, in tent or citadel, She ever was at hand to share the joy When we return'd successful from assault Or deed of arms. One evening in the dusk, The sunset red confronting the pale Moon, Returning I alighted at her tent, But not successful. Barely and with blows And desperate riding for full many a mile Had I that day escaped an ambuscade: My horse, as I dismounted, fell down dead, (Which grieved me to the heart, for we were friends,) And I was pale with sorrow and fatigue And somewhat by mishap discountenanced. She met me at the door, and in my face Read more than what was true; and presently Espying as I laid my casque aside Some streaks of blood that she mistook for mine, She fainted. In my then disconsolate mood A softness such as hers distill'd itself Like balm upon my being; and when at length Her spirit was rekindled from its trance And reassured, I told her my life's blood Should thenceforth vaunt a value not its own As flowing from a consecrated fount, A heart thenceforward hers. She hid her face An instant in her hands, then flung them forth, Revealing all the passion of her joy, That neither smiled nor laugh'd, but mantled high Effulgent and ineffably divine. A moment more and she was gone; her soul Demanding solitude and secret haunts To put away its treasure. I forthwith, As honour now enjoin'd me, sought the Duke, And craved her hand in marriage. William smiled; And there was satisfaction in his smile; But simple satisfaction was not all. An exultation temper'd by a doubt Was in it, and a joy with fear commix'd, And tainted by a secret self-rebuke For odious aims and treacherous intents. In simulated frankness he bestow'd The priceless boon, with only this reserve,— That seeing she was yet of age unripe, The nuptials should not now be solemnized, But wait his time; which, softly he subjoin'd, His heart should hasten. But, ere many days, The portent that perplex'd me in his smile I well could construe. By uneasy hints And intimations sounding me, the Duke Unfolded soon his lust to be a King, And seize on England. He essay'd to gild This thunder-cloud of dark design to me With promise of a station next himself, Earldoms and honours, all the crown could give. Earldoms and honours! Had my fallen estate Been lowlier than the lowliest Saxon serf's, And hopeless, not of crowns alone, but bread, The Tempter, though the same that tempted Eve, Could not in all his devilry have devised The bribe that would have bribed me to betray My country to a foreign yoke. I felt As worse than wrong or rapine, blows or death, The insult of the overture. Withal, Knowing my danger should I once disclose My anger and my just resolves, or wake Suspicion, I descended to defeat Like arts with like, dissembling with fair shows My inward indignation, although clear In blank refusal of my fealty. “With anxious outlook sought I next to know If yet the road to England open lay For me and Ulnoth; nor had far to seek: Advices soon were brought me, as by friends Betraying for my sake the Duke's behests, But verily by instruction from himself, That all the ways were guarded: we were watch'd; And, for a further menace, hints were dropp'd Of dungeons, gyves, and tortures,—things too vile For William, in whose eyes the world's esteem Went not for nothing, truly to perpend, But such as it was infamous to name. “As calmly as I might I now survey'd The state in which I stood. I call'd to mind With what a cordial confidence at first I sought his hospitality; how since We side by side had fought; how schemes of mine Had borne him fairest fruit; and twice mine arm Had saved him when in peril of his life. I thought of these things, and mine inmost soul Revolting from his perfidy, resolved It should not prosper. Edith! shall I dare In presence of thy purity to speak Of what I bent my nature to sustain! I sware with purposed falsehood to uphold The Duke's pretension. Then the way was free; And hastily as flying from my shame, To England I return'd. The rest thou know'st. Ambition, and my country's love for me, And mine for her, with hatred of that foe Whose dangerous dealings had ensnared my soul, Engross'd me; I address'd my every thought To fortify the league of Saxon Earls, And, other recollections dash'd to earth, I married Morcar's sister; by that tie, Though death dissolved it in a short three months, Making the North mine own. A few months more And Edward's death ensued. The Witena Had counsell'd him to leave the crown to me By testament: but he had dreamed a dream How a pale comet in the Northern sky, That then was nightly visible, shook its head, And the Seven Sleepers turn'd themselves in sleep. He made no will. But not the less the cry Rang out in one concent from North to South, From East to West, ‘Earl Harold shall be King!’ My marriage had forewarn'd the Duke, whose ships, Full fledged, were waiting till the wind was fair, When Tostig and Hardrada's wild descent And transient triumph summon'd me to York. A bloody day determined in the dust Their pride and prowess. Scarcely were they cold When posts from Pevensey at speed despatch'd Announced the Duke's approach. At double speed I march'd to meet him. Here we stand opposed; And here to-morrow's sun, which even now, If mine eyes err not, wakes the Eastern sky, Shall see the mortal issue. Should I fall, Be thou my witness that I nothing doubt The justness of my doom: but add thou this,— The justness lies betwixt my God and me. 'Twixt me and William . . . .” Then uprose the King: His daughter's hands half startled from his knee Dropt loosely, but her eye caught fire from his: He snatch'd his truncheon and the hollow earth Smote strongly that it throbb'd: he cried aloud— “'Twixt me and William, say that never doom Save that which sunders sheep from goats, and parts 'Twixt Heaven and Hell, can righteously pronounce.” —He sate again, and with an eye still stern But temperate and untroubled, he pursued: “'Twixt me and England, should some senseless swain Ask of my title, say I wear the crown Because it fits my head.” King Harold paused: And resting for a moment's space his brow Upon his hands, revolved a different theme. —“Oh, Edith,” he resumed, “of one thing more I fain would speak, if but the words will come: My vow to Adeliza rankles here As though my heart were broken in its breach; For she was faithfuller than her sire was false. To her, if I be slain, do thou repair, (For in the Norman camp or in the fleet She surely shall be found,) and bid her know I swerved not from her in my heart, but Fate, Ruled by her father's mandate, had decreed We could not meet in marriage: Say beside I make not this the scapegoat of my guilt, Which amply and in anguish I avow; Nor make I it a pretext to implore Her prayers and her forgiveness; seeing these Would be, though faithlessness were loveless too, Assured me by her nature's sweet constraint: But I bequeath this message of my love, That, knowing thus it died not with my death, Her sorrow, by a soft remembrance soothed, May sleep and dream and dreaming things divine Be gloriously transfigured by a hope. For love that dies not till the body dies Shall with the soul survive.” King Harold ceased: For now a phantom of a sound, that seem'd Blown by a distant trumpet from the South, Caught his quick ear: He sprang upon his feet: Then cheerfully the Saxon trumpets blew Their prompt reply: The leaders from their tents Came trooping, jocund, with a nimble tread, Their helmets glancing in the early sun; And as they gain'd the forest's edge, the cry Of “Harold” rose. Him Edith help'd to arm; Which ended, and a brief embrace exchanged, Upborne upon the blessing he bestow'd She with a lofty courage went her way. Long was the day and terrible. The cries Of “God to aid!” “The Cross!” “The Holy Cross!” With songs of Roland and of Roncesvalles, Were heard, then lost in dumbness and dismay. A mighty roar ensued, pierced through and through By shrillest shrieks incessant, or of man Or madden'd horse that scream'd with fear and pain— Death agonies. The battle, like a ship Then when the whirlwind hath it, torn and tost, Stagger'd from side to side. The day was long; By dreadful change of onset or feign'd flight, And rout and rally, direfully drawn out, Disastrous, dismal. Night was near, and still The victory undetermined, when a shaft Pierced Harold in the throat. He fell and died. Then panic seized the Saxon host, pursued With hideous rage, till dropp'd the pall of night, And darkness hid the horrors of the field. In Waltham Abbey on St. Agnes' Eve A stately corpse lay stretch'd upon a bier. The arms were cross'd upon the breast; the face, Uncover'd, by the taper's trembling light Show'd dimly the pale majesty severe Of him whom Death, and not the Norman Duke, Had conquer'd; him the noblest and the last Of Saxon Kings; save one the noblest he; The last of all. Hard by the bier were seen Two women, weeping side by side, whose arms Clasp'd each the other. Edith was the one. With Edith Adeliza wept and pray'd. STANZAS. [Soft be the voice and friendly that rebukes] Soft be the voice and friendly that rebukes The error of thy way, For sickness hath the summer of thy looks Touch'd with decay. Now may be pardon'd, even for virtue's sake, Words less of gall than grief— The warning of autumnal winds that shake The yellowing leaf. They bid thee if thou leav'st thy bloom behind, Bethink thee to repair That ravage, and the aspect of thy mind To make more fair. Let not thy loss of brightness be a loss, Which might be countless gain, If from thy beauty it should purge the dross, Eat out the stain. Then beauty with pure purposes allied Wouldst thou account—to lift The minds of men from worldliness and pride— A trust—not gift. Oh! may thy sickness, sanative to thee, Bring thee to know that trust! That so thy soul may to thy beauty be Not less than just. IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE HON. EDWARD ERNEST VILLIERS. WHO DIED AT NICE, ON THE 30TH OCTOBER, 1843. I. A grace though melancholy, manly too, Moulded his being: pensive, grave, serene, O'er his habitual bearing and his mien Unceasing pain, by patience temper'd, threw A shade of sweet austerity. But seen In happier hours and by the friendly few, That curtain of the spirit was withdrawn, And fancy light and playful as a fawn, And reason imp'd with inquisition keen, Knowledge long sought with ardour ever new, And wit love-kindled, show'd in colours true What genial joys with sufferings can consist: Then did all sternness melt as melts a mist Touch'd by the brightness of the golden dawn, Aerial heights disclosing, valleys green, And sunlights thrown the woodland tufts between, And flowers and spangles of the dewy lawn. II. And even the stranger, though he saw not these, Saw what would not be willingly pass'd by: In his deportment, even when cold and shy, Was seen a clear collectedness and ease, A simple grace and gentle dignity, That fail'd not at the first accost to please; And as reserve relented by degrees, So winning was his aspect and address, His smile so rich in sad felicities, Accordant to a voice which charm'd no less, That who but saw him once remember'd long, And some in whom such images are strong Have hoarded the impression in their heart Fancy's fond dreams and Memory's joys among, Like some loved relic of romantic song Or cherish'd master-piece of ancient art. III. His life was private; safely led, aloof From the loud world,—which yet he understood Largely and wisely, as no worldling could. For he by privilege of his nature proof Against false glitter, from beneath the roof Of privacy, as from a cave, survey'd With steadfast eye its flickering light and shade, And justly judged for evil and for good. But whilst he mix'd not for his own behoof In public strife, his spirit glow'd with zeal, Not shorn of action, for the public weal,— For truth and justice as its warp and woof, For freedom as its signature and seal. His life thus sacred from the world, discharged From vain ambition and inordinate care, In virtue exercised, by reverence rare Lifted, and by humility enlarged, Became a temple and a place of prayer. In latter years he walk'd not singly there; For one was with him, ready at all hours His griefs, his joys, his inmost thoughts to share, Who buoyantly his burthens help'd to bear, And deck'd his altars daily with fresh flowers. IV. But farther may we pass not; for the ground Is holier than the Muse herself may tread; Nor would I it should echo to a sound Less solemn than the service for the dead. Mine is inferior matter,—my own loss,— The loss of dear delights for ever fled, Of reason's converse by affection fed, Of wisdom, counsel, solace, that across Life's dreariest tracts a tender radiance shed. Friend of my youth! though younger yet my guide, How much by thy unerring insight clear I shaped my way of life for many a year, What thoughtful friendship on thy deathbed died Friend of my youth, whilst thou wast by my side Autumnal days still breathed a vernal breath; How like a charm thy life to me supplied All waste and injury of time and tide, How like a disenchantment was thy death! SENT WITH SOME LEAVES AND FLOWERS FOUND IN A BOOK TO THE PERSON WHO HAD PUT THEM THERE THIRTY YEARS BEFORE. Oh tender leaves and flowers, Though wither'd, tender yet; What privilege of joy was ours In youth when first we met. Bright eyes beheld your bloom, Fair hands your charms caress'd, And not irreverent was the doom That laid you here to rest. Sweet phantoms, from your bed Thus re-arisen, you paint The likeness of a love long dead In faded colours faint. Oh tender flowers and leaves! By all our vanish'd joys— By glittering spring-tide that deceives, By winter that destroys— Though nought can now restore The perish'd to its place, Eyes dimm'd by time and tears once more Shall look you in the face. LAGO VARESE. (VISITED IN 1827.) I stood beside Varese's Lake, Mid that redundant growth Of vines and maize and bower and brake Which Nature, kind to sloth And scarce solicited by human toil, Pours from the riches of the teeming soil. A mossy softness distance lent To each divergent hill; One crept away looking back as it went, The rest lay round and still; The westering sun not dazzling now, though bright, Shed o'er the mellow land a molten light. And rambling on by creek and cove, I found upon the strand A shallop, and a girl who strove To drag it to dry land: I stood to see—the girl look'd round—her face Had all her country's clear and definite grace. She rested with the air of rest So seldom seen, of those Whose toil remitted gives a zest Not languour to repose. Her form was poised yet buoyant, firm though free, And liberal of her bright black eyes was she. Her hue reflected back the skies That redden'd in the West; And joy was laughing in her eyes And bounding in her breast, Its sovereignty exulting to proclaim Where pride could make no mutiny, nor shame. This sunshine of the Southern face, At home we have it not; And if they be a reckless race, These Southerns, yet a lot More favour'd on the chequer'd earth is theirs,— They have life's sorrows, but escape its cares. For her if Sorrow lay in wait The ambush was of flowers, And hers was such a smile as sate Triumphant on the Hours; A smile it was that seem'd to claim for earth Some lost inheritance of primal mirth. There is a smile which wit extorts From grave and learned men, In whose austere and senile sports The plaything is a pen; And there are smiles by shallow worldlings worn To grace a lie or laugh a truth to scorn: And there are smiles with less alloy Of those who, for the sake Of some they love, would kindle joy Which they can not partake: But hers was of the kind which simply say They come from hearts ungovernably gay. And oh! that gaiety of heart! There lives not he to whom Its laugh more pleasure will impart Than to the man of gloom; Who if he laugh, laughs less from mirth of mind Than deference to the customs of mankind. The day went down; the last red ray Flash'd on her face or ere It sank—and creeping up the bay The night-wind stirr'd her hair; The crimsom wave caress'd her naked feet With coy approach and resonant retreat. True native of the clime was she, Nor could there have been found A creature who should more agree With everything around,— The woods, the fields, and genial Nature, rife With life and gifts that feed and gladden life. Congenial all that met the sight, But in what met the mind The spirit's intuition might A discrepancy find; For foresight is a melancholy gift That bares the bald and speeds the all-too-swift: Methought this scene before mine eyes, Still glowing with yon sun That seem'd to melt the myriad dyes Of heaven and earth to one, A divers unity—methought this scene, These undulant hills, the woods that intervene, The multiplicity of growth, The corn-field and the brake, The trellised vines that cover both, The purple-bosom'd lake, Some fifty summers hence may all be found Rich in the charms wherewith they now abound. And should I take my staff again, And should I journey here, My steps may be less steady then, My eyesight not so clear, And from the mind the sense of beauty may Even as these bodily gifts have pass'd away: But grant mine age but eyes to see, A still susceptive mind, All that leaves us, and all that we Leave wilfully behind, And nothing here would want the charms it wore, Save only she who stands upon the shore. LAGO LUGANO. (VISITED IN 1843.) I Gone are some sixteen summers since the day When rambling by Varese's reddening lake, I met that merry maid, and for her sake Wove the brief chaplet of that perishing lay: Now let me weave another if I may, For once again my wandering way I take Thro' lands where music chimes from every mouth, And where the sun lights up with cloudless ray The chambers of the South. II Gone are those summers—youth and health are gone, And feebler and less frequent are the gleams That startled erst my heart and fill'd my dreams From transitory faces that but shone An instant on my path; and few or none Are now the soaring hours when fancy teems With visions fair: so be it! I recall The past without regret—for here is one Whose love repays me all. III My youth without its hardness and alloy I have in her, and much that ne'er was mine,— A simple heart, a human face divine Where tears of tenderness with radiant joy Will oftentimes alternate nor destroy Each other's traces,—these with wit combine And graver gifts, to yield me treasures more Than all youth's fancies fugitive and coy Returning could restore. IV And she was with me, and alone we stray'd By Lake Lugano one delightful morn, Through woods not yet dismantled nor forlorn, For old October slept beneath their shade Forgetful of his function, to upbraid The leaves' light dancing and the fields forewarn Of coming winter: like the light leaves we In sunshine were as sumptuously array'd As summer's self could be. V We pass'd the wood, and where high walls between And through rich vineyards thick with clusters red A causeway to the owner's dwelling led, We rested in the shade; for there a screen Of branches of the vine had fashion'd been To arch the causeway's entrance overhead: Nature had nearly done it; but the art Of some kind hand that loved her might be seen As architect in part. VI The lake lay glimmering through the wood below; From its sweet shores upsprang the mountains stern, And mid the loftiest we could well discern One that was shining in a cusp of snow: A butterfly went flickering to and fro Hard by, and seeing he had yet to learn That arduous lesson how to spend an hour Of holiday aright, we bade him go And fasten on a flower. VII Our book for us: of amaranthine hues The flowers that to the free but searching sight Did there disclose their inmost beauty bright! Flowers were they that were planted by the Muse In a deep soil which the continual dews Of blessing had enrich'd: no lesser light Than what was lit in Sydney's spirit clear Or given to saintly Herbert's to diffuse Now lives in thine, De Vere. VIII So pass'd the noontide hour; the breathless air Propitious to the intent mind's equipoise, And silent all, save now and then the noise Of a light rustling in the ivy, where With short quick run and sudden stop and stare The lizard fled surprised. But strenuous joys And claiming respite from their stress and strain Are those which verse imparts, if read with care And written to remain. IX Now therefore we arose and went our way; And as we pass'd the dwelling where abode The owner of the vineyards, in the road There stood two daughters of the house: the sway Of English manners overturn'd that day Permitted us to speak: a marvellous mode Of foreign speech was mine, but it express'd To willing listeners what I wish'd to say As amply as the best. X A frank amusement in the eyes of each Detracted nothing from their courteous cheer; Their sister voices were, though sweet, not clear, But sounded softly hoarse, as sounds the beach Of some cliff-shelter'd cove or inland reach Where the sea slumbers,—voices to our ear That spake a life of liberty and ease, Where simple hearts redound to simple speech And simple pleasures please. XI We ask'd for fruit; yet kindlier than before They bade us in, and we were seated soon In the bower'd window of a large saloon; A wench whose face a double welcome wore For them and for herself, produced good store, And fast the minutes fled: companions boon By flowing cups exalted scarce could be Than those two girls irradiated more, More happy than were we. XII Too fast the minutes fled! We bade adieu To each kind sister not without regret, Nor linger'd now; for now the sun was set, And of the stars, though most were faint, a few Began to glitter in the paler blue. Ere long we reach'd our goal—a point where met Lake, vineyard, chesnut wood, and whence was seen Fairest of mountains, soft but awful too, St. Salvador serene. XIII Thence we return'd, revolving as we went The lessons this and previous days had taught In rambling meditations; and we sought To read the face of Italy, intent With equal eye and just arbitrament To measure its expressions as we ought: And chiefly one conclusion did we draw,— That liberty dwelt here with Heaven's consent, Though not by human law. XIV A liberty imperfect, undesign'd,— A liberty of circumstance; but still A liberty that moulds the heart and will And works an inward freedom of the mind. Not such is statutable freedom: blind Are they to whom the letter that doth kill Stands for the spirit that giveth life: sore pains They take to set Ambition free, and bind The heart of man in chains. XV Ambition, Envy, Avarice, and Pride— These are the tyrants of our hearts: the laws Which cherish these in multitudes, and cause The passions that aforetime lived and died In palaces, to flourish far and wide Throughout a land—(allot them what applause We may, for wealth and science that they nurse And greatness)—seen upon their darker side Bear the primæval curse. XVI Oh England! “Merrie England,” styled of yore! Where is thy mirth? Thy jocund laughter, where? The sweat of labour on the brow of care Makes a mute answer—driven from every door! The may-pole cheers the village green no more, Nor harvest-home, nor Christmas mummers rare; The tired mechanic at his lecture sighs, And of the learned, which, with all his lore, Has leisure to be wise? XVII Civil and moral liberty are twain: That truth the careless countenances free Of Italy avouch'd; that truth did we, On converse grounds and with reluctant pain, Confess that England proved. Wash first the stain Of wordliness away; when that shall be, Us shall “the glorious liberty” befit Whereof, in other far than earthly strain, The Jew of Tarsus writ. XVIII So shall the noble natures of our land (Oh nobler and more deeply founded far Than any born beneath a Southern star!) Move more at large, with ampler reach expand, Be open, courteous, not more strong to stand Than just to yield,—nor obvious to each jar That shakes the proud; for Independence walks With staid Humility aye hand in hand, Whilst Pride in tremor stalks. XIX From pride plebeian and from pride high-born, From pride of knowledge no less vain and weak, From overstrain'd activities that seek Ends worthiest of indifference or scorn, From pride of intellect that exalts its horn In contumely above the wise and meek, Exulting in coarse cruelties of the pen, From pride of drudging souls to Mammon sworn, Where shall we flee and when? XX One House of Refuge in this dreary waste Was, through God's mercy, by our fathers built,— That house the Church: Oh England, if the guilt Of pride and greed thy grandeur have abased, Thy liberty endanger'd, here be placed Thy trust: thy freedom's garment, if thou wilt, To piece by charters and by statutes strive, But to its personal rescue, haste, oh haste! And save its soul alive. XXI Thus pour'd we forth our hearts: but now 'twas late; The stars were fully out, and other light Was none; in secret sessions of the night The mountains closing kept a gloomier state. A boat whose oars with punctual sound sedate Seem'd like the pulse of silence, stole in sight And sped us to the town.—End, end they must, Such days! But lasting are the gains and great They leave behind in trust. To H. C. (In reply.) It may be folly—they are free Who think it so, to laugh or blame, But single sympathies to me Are more than fame. The glen and not the mountain-top I love; and though its date be brief, I snatch the rose you send, and drop The laurel leaf. STANZAS. [Dear Nina, how betides it that with you] Dear Nina, how betides it that with you Sickness and Sorrow, which since Time was born Were Youth's destroyers, seem but to renew The twilight softness of your dewy morn? You days of Charlton, how you laugh'd to scorn The imminent Future! Portion it its due; I look in those large eyes whose tender blue The darken'd hair now deepens, and maintain That Time with all his following forlorn, Sickness and Sorrow, Injury and Pain, If a Destroyer, is an Angel too. Dante, the glorious dreamer, was he wrong The “Mount of Preparation” to invest With sapphire hues, and people with a throng Of happy Spirits? One at his behest Sang the remember'd strain he loved the best, Whereby he knew that early loves are strong Met in the “Second Region:” I so long There wandering, hear a voice when daylight fades And shines the Love-Star singly in the West, Sweeter than what was sweetest in the shades Of Purgatory, Casella's broken song. THE AMPHITHEATRE AT POZZUOLI. The strife, the gushing blood, the mortal throe, With scenic horrors fill'd that belt below, And where the polish'd seats were round it raised, Worse spectacle! the pleased spectators gazed. Such were the pastimes of times past! Oh shame! Oh infamy! that men who drew the breath Of freedom, and who shared the Roman name, Should so corrupt their sports with pain and death. —The pastimes of times past? And what are thine, Thou with thy gun or greyhound, rod and line? Pain, terror, mortal agonies, that scare Thy heart in Man, to brutes thou wilt not spare. Are theirs less sad and real? Pain in Man Bears the high mission of the flail and fan; In brutes 'tis purely piteous. God's command, Submitting His mute creatures to our hand For life and death, thou shalt not dare to plead; He bade thee kill them, not for sport, but need. Then backward if thou cast reproachful looks On sports bedarkening custom erst allow'd, Expect from coming ages like rebukes When day shall dawn on peacefuller woods and brooks, And clear from vales thou troublest, custom's cloud. TWO WAYS OF LIFE. Alwine, Adelais, Hildebrand. A FOREST SCENE. Alwine. The path is to your right; be not alarm'd; For I have haunted this old forest long And learnt its ways. Adelais. I have no fears—with you. Hildebrand. I heard a horn but lately, nor long since I saw the King. It is not far we've wander'd; And after facing that so insolent Sun In all his mid-day triumph mounting high, How grateful is this gloom! these sylvan vaults, How they protect the spirit! Adelais. I could dream I were a maid that for the cloister quits The monarch's court, finding in this retreat That peace the world refused her. Hildebrand. Rather say That peace it had not to bestow. Your thought Might fancy from her wardrobe well attire With many an apt similitude; to chaunt Morning and evening service there is here A numerous choir, nor is their song of praise Less sacred because cheerful; and at noon Comes meditative stillness, or by fits Some soft confession of a wandering wind Makes silence audible and sweet repose Aware that it exists. By fancy fed 'Tis thus we revel in resemblances; But truth . . . Alwine. Renounces and abjures them! No; Love, if you will, the woods, and love their ways, But, I beseech you, love not for their sake The life to which you liken them. Believe me, The cloisters of the forest merit praise For innocence and peace, which never yet Those of the convent justified. Adelais. To me Ere yet my credulous childhood had been taught To question what I saw, the cherub choir, The chaunt, the thuribule, the stoled procession, Seem'd heaven itself more than the way to heaven; And as the tournaments and shows of war Fill high the hearts of boys, so me a girl Did ceremonials of the Church enchant, Raise to religious rapture, and uplift With fond desires to wage the war of faith In a conventual life. And are they gone? Those fond desires—that rapture of the heart? Alwine. They are—they are—I give them God's good speed. Hildebrand. Far other lessons shall we learn from Him Who for the love of man was made a man, Walking the earth in love, by links of love With man associate humanly in life, And human sorrow deifying in death, That so this cursory world He might bequeath A practicable passage, not impure Since trodden of His feet.—I stretch too far The privilege of the old to teach their betters. Farewell—that cry recalls me to the chase. [Exit. Alwine. A tale there is pertaining to this wood Which, but that I should tell it ill, might steal Some moments you would not repent to spare From the day's pastime. Adelais. Place me on the trunk Of that uprooted oak, where shine and shade, Moved by the wandering minstrel in the trees, Dance to his music. Tell me now the tale. Alwine. Once on this forest's edge a castle rose That dwarf'd to very shrubs its loftiest oaks, A ruin now, half buried, half o'ergrown. Sole did it stand, dividing warlike states, As midway in a torrent some huge rock; And in it dwelt a maid whose shapely form Was like the hare-bell that so lightly springs Out from the huge rock midway in the torrent; And from its turrets could the maid descry A convent in a valley, which with looks Wistful and sad she oft regarded long, For she was weary of wild usages, And sick because the eyes that look'd at her Were cold, and obdurate, and haughty. Adelais. All? Alwine. Some more, some less.—And finding thus no rest, She went one night to seek the Sibyl's cave Deep in the forest, and to know from her (That Sibyl ever young who witness bare With David of the course and end of time) Which life were worthier,—that which braved the world And all its trials, or which fled the world And knew no trials, but was blankly pure. Aldelais. What answer made the Sibyl? Alwine. None by word She took her by the hand and led her far Through brake and briar in darkness many a rood, And stopp'd where bubbled up a fountain clear Beside an ancient cross: Lo! here, she said, Life springeth: then with measured step sedate Advanced again, but counting as she went, And stopp'd again: and here, she said, behold The parting of the ways—life sunders here. With that she sang a low sweet melody, Mysterious but penetrating too, Which with a slow and subtle magic crept Into the bosom of the darkness. Soon It ceased, and as it ceased, a glorious light Forth from the bosom of the darkness burst, And fill'd the ways of life. Adelais. What ways were they? Alwine. The maiden where she stood could see but twain, Each a long avenue; of yews was this And palms commingled; that, of various growth; Each with a roof of intertangled boughs, And crossways at the close an open grave. Midway the path beyond the one grave grew A single cypress; at each end the other A willow. Down the path of palms and yews A bloodless phantom of a woman walk'd, Hooded and veil'd, with languid step and slow And oft reverted head. Once and again A holy rapture lifted her, and scarce She seem'd to touch the ground; but presently It left her, and with languid step and slow And drooping posture pass'd she on her way, Still praying as she went, but stumbling still Through weariness o'er sticks and straws, and still With sticks and straws she quarrell'd as she pray'd. When she approach'd the grave that crossways closed The avenue, though weary of the way, She seem'd not glad, but shudder'd and recoil'd, Shaking through weakness of her weariness; And though she upward look'd, look'd backward too, And so with arms that clasp'd the solitude She slowly disappear'd:—This way of life, The Sibyl said, is the way celibate, Where walks erroneous many a monk and nun: The good therein is good that dies therein And hath no offspring; neither hath the evil; For He that out of evil bringeth good Begets no issue on the evil here: Probation blotted from the book of life With evil good obliterates; for these two, In quality though opposite and at war, Are each to each correlative and essential, And evil conquer'd maketh moral good, With virtue, which is more than innocence. But now, she said, behold that other way. The maiden turned obedient, and beheld Where at the outset from a myrtle bower A figure like Aurora flush'd with joy Leapt lightly forth, and dancing down the path Shook the bright dewdrops from the radiant wreath That crown'd her locks profuse: ere long the flush Subsided, and the bounding steps were stay'd; But firmly still and with a durable strength She travell'd on: not seldom on her way A colour'd cloud diaphanous, like those That gild the morn, conceal'd her; but ere long She issued thence, and with her issued thence A naked child that roll'd amongst the flowers And laugh'd and cried: a thicker cloud anon Fell round her, and from that with sunken eyes She issued, and with stains upon her cheek From scalding tears; but onward still she look'd And upward still, and on her brow upturn'd And on the paleness of her penitent face A glory broke, the dayspring from on high: Thenceforth with loftier and less troubled strength And even step she trod the tremulous earth, Elastic, not elate: the grave was near That crossways cut the path; but with her went A company of spirits bright and young Which caught the blossoms from her wreath that fell And gave them back; and as she reach'd the close, Gazing betwixt the willows far beyond Full many a group successive she descried With wreaths like hers; and as she softly sank A heavenly hope that like a rainbow spann'd A thousand earthly hopes, its colours threw Across the gloomy entrance of the grave. This, said the Sibyl, is the secular way— With joys more free and nobler sorrows fraught, Which scatter by their force life's frivolous cares And meaner molestations: stern the strokes, The struggles arduous which this way presents, And fearful the temptations; but the stake Is worthier of the strife, and she that wins Hears at the gate of heaven the words “Well done” And “Enter thou.”—The Sibyl ceased; the maid Look'd round, and saw—not her, but in her place A suppliant bending low: he press'd her hand Imploringly, and ask'd her,—“Of those ways Which choosest thou? and is it not the last?” What answer to that lowly suppliant gave That maiden mild? Adelais. I think she answer'd “Yes.” THE HERO, THE POET, AND THE GIRL. Something between a pasture and a park, Saved from sea-breezes by a hump of down, Tossed blue-bells in the face of April, dark With fitful frown: And there was he, that gentle hero, who, By virtue and the strength of his right arm, Dethroned an unjust king, and then withdrew To tend his farm: To whom came forth a mighty man of song, Whose deep-mouthed music rolls thro' all the land, Voices of many rivers, rich or strong, Or sweet or grand. I turned from Bard and Patriot, like some churl Senseless to Powers that hold the world in fee,— How is it that the face of one fair girl Is more to me? SONNET IN THE MAIL COACH. What means at this unusual hour the light In yonder casement? Doth it hint a tale Of trouble, when some maiden mourner pale Confides her sorrows to the secret night? Or doth it speak of youth uprising bright With glad alacrity ere morning break To chase a hope new-started; or—but lo! The wan light creeps with stealthy motion slow Across the chamber: shall we token take From this that o'er sick bed or mortal throe Sad watch is kept?—Small answer can I make, Nor more can of that dim-seen watcher know, Than that some object, passion, throb, or ache, Has kept some solitary heart awake. STANZAS. [For me no roseate garlands twine] For me no roseate garlands twine, But wear them, Dearest, in my stead; Time has a whiter hand than thine, And lays it on my head. Enough to know thy place on earth Is there where roses latest die; To know the steps of youth and mirth Are thine, that pass me by. TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, AFTER READING CERTAIN CRITICISMS ON “HIS LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE.” Farewell, great heart! how great shall they Who love true greatness truly know, Though from thy grave the popinjay Cry “tear him” to the carrion crow. Farewell, pure Spirit! o'er thy tomb, Write canker'd critics what they please, A temple rises, and the womb Of Time is big with devotees. REPROACH REPROVED. Reproach me not; for if my love run high, Unjust complainings well may drain it dry; Reproach me not; if love run low, reproach Did never yet set dried-up love abroach. THE FLIGHT. Perched on a rafter in a windy barn, Head on one side inquisitive, blue lids Winking at gleamings of the moonshine white, In meditative stillness thomas stood,— Thomas of Emily the best beloved, Thomas the best of owls. Revolving long The past, the present, in his secret soul, Thoughts nursed in silence, thoughts that gathered strength From reticence, arose,—and they were these: This Emily means well, is kind, nay more, I may presume to say reveals herself In accents which no owl with ears to hear And half a heart, can choose but understand; The food that she provides is plentiful And good, and I were but a thankless owl To murmur (though the partridge-wing last night Might better have been raw); the enemy, Small but tormenting, ambushed in my down She valiantly confronts and shares my pain: All this I grant, and, granting all, still ask Is she a helpmate meet? How so? By night I wake, she sleeps; I sleep by day, she wakes. Can she catch mice? I doubt it. And her voice, Expressive though it be, nor wanting tones Significant of love, may not compare With one that in the watches of the night Will sometimes reach me, echoing from afar,— The voice of that ideal treasured long, Long treasured in my heart, the voice of her, Madge Howlet of the Ivy Tod. Farewell, Fond Emily! Georgina too, Farewell! And Riversdale! my friends, but not my kind; Nature is strong within me; I will break The bonds of alien custom: Madge, I come. By yon moon that keeps her place Ordered in the realms of space, By the stars that hold their courses, By the streams that know their sources, By the dateless solitudes Of the immemorial woods,— Madge, I come: By the voice of old that spoke From the inside of an oak, Saying to my kith and kin Here is house-room, enter in,— Madge, I come: By the souls of all the owls That with pride ancestral swelling Scorned the ways of barn-door fowls And with Nature had their dwelling; By the Fathers of our line, Ominous deemed, if not divine, Sacred erst to Proserpine, Whom wise Glaucopis, born of Jove, Honoured above all the grove, Whence descended to our race Godlike gravity of face,— Madge, I come: What ruin old, In wood or wold, Sent forth that cry, “Fly, fly, oh fly!” 'Tis Nature's voice, And I obey; If Madge rejoice Let mourn who may— To Man and all his Emilies, Adieu! I fly, oh woods, oh wolds, oh Madge, to you. OLYMPIA MORATA. WRITTEN AFTER VISITING HER GRAVE AT HEIDELBERG. A tombstone in a foreign land cries out, Oh Italy! against thee: She whose death This stone commemorates with no common praise, By birth was thine: but being vowed to Truth, The blood-stain'd hand that lurks beneath thine alb Was raised to strike; and lest one crime the more Should stand in thine account to heaven, she fled. Then hither came she, young but erudite, With ardour flush'd, but with old wisdom stored (Which spake no tongue she knew not), apt to learn And eloquent to teach,—and welcomed here Gave the brief beauty of her innocent life An alien race to illustrate; and here Dying in youth (the beauty of her death Sealing her life's repute), her ashes gave An honour to the land that honour'd her. —Jerusalem! Jerusalem! which killest The Prophets! if thy house be desolate, Those temples too are desolate and that land Where Truth's pure votaries may not leave their dust. SONG. [The bee to the heather] The bee to the heather, The lark to the sky, The roe to the greenwood, And whither shall I? Oh, Alice! oh, Alice! So sweet to the bee Are the moorland and heather By Cannock and Leigh! Oh, Alice! oh, Alice! O'er Teddesley Park The sunny sky scatters The notes of the lark! Oh, Alice! oh, Alice! In Beaudesert glade The roes toss their antlers For joy of the shade!— But Alice, dear Alice! Glade, moorland, nor sky, Without you can content me, And whither shall I? HEROISM IN THE SHADE. WRITTEN AFTER THE RETURN OF SIR H. POTTINGER FROM CHINA, IN 1845. I. The Million smiles; the taverns ring with toasts; A thousand journals teem with good report And plauditory paragraph; with hosts Of thankful deputations swarm the streets; His native city of her hero boasts; The minister who chose him, in the choice Exults; and prompted to its part, the court The echo of the country's praise repeats, And by the popular pitchpipe tunes its voice. II. But where is he whose genius led the way To all this triumph? Elliot, where is he? —When first that Monster of the Eastern sea, That hugest empire which for ages lay Becalm'd beneath the sun, with strange see-saws Convulsively unsheath'd its quivering claws, 'Twas he that watch'd its motions many a day, Foreseeing and foretelling that the sleep For those unnumber'd centuries so deep Would pass; and when its rage and fear at length Shook off thenumbness from its labouring strength, 'Twas he whose skill and courage gagg'd its gaping jaws. III. Justice, Truth, Mercy,—these his weapons were; And if the sword, 'twas wielded but to spare Through timely terror worse event. With rare And excellent contemperature he knew How best on martial ardour to confer The honours that are then alone its due When patience, prudence, ruth are honour'd too. When to relent he saw, and when to dare, Sudden to strike, magnanimous to forbear: Prone lay the second city of that land, Third of the world, a suppliant at the feet Of him whom erst she gloried to maltreat! But then a great heart to itself was true— On the rash soldier's bridle was the hand Of Elliot laid, with calm but firm command. IV. Thou mighty city with thy million souls! To England, through that rescue, art thou made A treasure-house of tribute and of trade! To England, whose street-statesmen, blind as moles. Scribe-taught, and ravening like wolves for blood, Spared not his wisdom's temperance to upbraid Who thus thy ruin righteously withstood. Thou mighty city, for thy ruler's faults, Not thine, how many an innocent had bled, How many a wife and mother hung her head In agony above thy funeral vaults, What horrors had been thine, what shame were ours, If he, by popular impulses betray'd, Or of rash judgments selfishly afraid, Had render'd up thy wealth and blood to feast That hunger of the many-headed beast Which its own seed-corn tramples and devours. V. But service such as his, to virtue vow'd, Ne'er tax'd for noise the weasand of the crowd, Most thankless in their ignorance and spleen. His glory blossoms in the shade, unseen Save by the few and wise; to them alone His daring, prudence, fortitude are known. —In the beginning had his portion been, Even as a pilot's in a sea unplough'd By cursive keel before, when winds pipe loud And all is undiscover'd and untried, To take the difficult soundings in the dark, And then with tentative and wary course, And changing oft with change of wind and tide, The shoals to pass, evade the current's force, And keep unhurt his unappointed bark;— A tentative and wary course to steer, But ever with a gay and gallant cheer. This task perform'd, when now the way was clear, The armament provided, and the mark, Though hard to be attain'd, was full in sight, Upon his prosperous path there fell a blight, Distrust arrested him in mid-career. VI. Another reap'd where he had sown: success, Doubtless well-won, attended him to whom The harvesting was given: his honours bloom Brightly, and many a rapturous caress The populace bestows—what could they less? Far be from me malignly to assume Such praise, how oft soe'er it may have swerved From a just mark, must needs be undeserved: But knowing by whom the burthen and the heat Was borne,—with what intrepid zeal, what skill, Care, enterprise, and scope of politic thought,— Through labours, dangers, obloquy, ill-will, Battle, captivities, and shipwreck, still, With means or wanting means, alert to meet In all conjunctures all events,—if aught Could make a wise man wonder at the ways Of Fortune, and the world's awards of praise, 'Twould be, whilst taverns ring and tankards foam Healths to this hero of the harvest-home, To think what welcome had been his whose toil Had fell'd the forest and prepared the soil. VII. What makes a hero? Not success, not fame, Inebriate merchants and the loud acclaim Of glutted avarice, caps toss'd up in the air, Or pen of journalist with flourish fair, Bells peal'd, stars, ribands, and a titular name,— These, though his rightful tribute, he can spare; His rightful tribute, not his end or aim, Or true reward; for never yet did these Refresh the soul or set the heart at ease. —What makes a hero? An heroic mind Express'd in action, in endurance proved: And if there be pre-eminence of right, Derived through pain well suffer'd, to the height Of rank heroic, 'tis to bear unmoved, Not toil, not risk, not rage of sea or wind, Not the brute fury of barbarians blind, But worse,—ingratitude and poisonous darts Launch'd by the country he had served and loved: This with a free unclouded spirit pure, This in the strength of silence to endure, A dignity to noble deeds imparts Beyond the gauds and trappings of renown: This is the hero's complement and crown; This miss'd, one struggle had been wanting still, One glorious triumph of the heroic will, One self-approval in his heart of hearts. ST. HELEN'S-AUCKLAND. I wander o'er each well-known field My boyhood's home in view, And thoughts that were as fountains seal'd Are welling forth anew. The ancient house, the aged trees, They bring again to light The years that like a summer breeze Were trackless in their flight. How much is changed of what I see, How much more changed am I, And yet how much is left—to me How is the distant nigh! The walks are overgrown and wild, The terrace flags are green, But I am once again a child, I am what I have been. The sounds that round about me rise Are what none other hears; I see what meets no other eyes, Though mine are dim with tears. The breaking of the summer's morn— The tinge on house and tree— The billowy clouds—the beauty born Of that celestial sea, The freshness of the faëry land Lit by the golden gleam . . . . It is my youth that where I stand Comes back as in a dream. Alas, the real never lent Those tints, too bright to last; They fade and bid me rest content And let the past be past. The wave that dances to the breast Of earth, can ne'er be stay'd; The star that glitters in the crest Of morning, needs must fade: But there shall flow another tide, So let me hope, and far Over the outstretch'd waters wide Shall shine another star. In every change of Man's estate Are lights and guides allow'd; The fiery pillar will not wait, But parting, sends the cloud. Nor mourn I the less manly part Of life to leave behind; My loss is but the lighter heart, My gain the graver mind. THE LYNNBURN. Revisited in 1839. I Again, oh stream, beloved in earlier years And not unsung, within thy wooded glen I stand, and inwardly my hushed heart hears The same remembrancer that murmured then; For thou wert with me ere the haunts of men Were trodden of my feet, and thou could'st gloze Even in the days long past of younger days than those. II And I would ask, melodious recluse Whose sameness measures change, if I be still Like him who whilom turned his fancy loose To chase the shadows thro' thy woods at will; I would be told of change for good and ill, And know if I be capable, as once, To thy low call to make a musical response. III The old plank bridge is gone—the stone-built arch Is but a sorry substitute to me; But mining still beneath that leaning larch The same slow current spreads itself: I see Reflected there a face how changed since we Were neighbours, and so oft at eventide (Then was thy sweet voice sweetest) wandered side by side. IV Some twenty years have held since then their course In light and shade, in smiles and bitterness, And so long I have been to thee perforce Occasional, not constant; not the less In gladness have I sought thee and in distress, And counsel sweet we still together took At every change of life in this sequestered nook. V What did'st thou witness first? the life of dreams, Of genial nights and mornings run to waste, Ambitious hopes, a fancy fired by themes Of thoughtless passion, labour much misplaced In aping wild effusions where false taste Bedecks false feeling, visionary love For what not earth below affords nor Heav'n above. VI This ere I left thee: Then the sturdier state Of youthful manhood, prompt for action, proud Of self-reliance, strenuous in debate, Presumptuous in decision, by a crowd Of busy cares encompassed, which allowed For dreaming sensibilities scant scope;— Yet room for one fair face vouchsafed, one fearful hope. VII A will disordered, hurried mind, and heart Though wearied yet intolerant of rest, Thou cunning'st adept in the healing art I brought to thee; well knowing thou wert blest With wondrous power to still the troubled breast;— Than thou none more, save Siloa's brook which feeds The flowers that breathe their balm from sempiternal meads. VIII Another change;—the face was no more seen, The hope expired: the appetite for rule, Advancement, civil station, which had been Therewith allied, began thenceforth to cool: To be the powerful, serviceable tool Of statecraft seemed inglorious, and with feet Less shackled did I then revisit this retreat. IX 'Twas summer, and I heard the cushat coo, And saw the dog-rose blooming in the groves; All was as fresh as when the world was new; I plucked the roses, listened to the doves, Forgetful for a season of fixed loves And fugitive caresses—I was free: Then came the Muse and laid her thrilling hand on me. X Not wholly slighted had she been before, But now my heart was hers by night and day; I loved her not for honours that she wore In the World's eye, rich robe and wreath of bay, But for herself—and therefore did I pay My service due with labour slow and sure In secret many a year, content to be obscure. XI A change again;—my name had travelled far, And in the World's applausive countenance kind I sunned myself—not fearing so to mar That strength of heart and liberty of mind Which comes but by hard nurture: Me, tho' blind, God's mercy spared—from social snares with ease Saved by that gracious gift, inaptitude to please. XII To thee I fled; and it was then thy mood To teach Autumnal lessons; for a blast Blown by the North had weeded from thy wood The yellow leaf, but o'er the russet past, That graver beauty leaving to the last By strength of stem preserved: Thou said'st “Behold Such colours life should keep when skies are dark and cold.” XIII My “yea” fell flat: The interests that are youth's And youth's alone, could now no more be mine; The soul's deep, sacred and sufficing truths; Seemed to dim eyes too distantly divine; A world that will not flatter, to resign Costs little: but life's wherewithal ran low When bounty at my need new sources bade to flow. XIV For of the many one who smiled at first On better knowledge wore a smile as bright; And still when dreariness had done its worst And dryness weaned the multitude, despite Of doubts and sore disturbance that pure light Burnt up reanimate, wherein to live Was the one genuine joy that Earth had now to give. XV Last change of all, I hither brought my bride, At whom each sweetest, freshest woodland flower Laughed as to see a sister by its side; And old eyes glistened in that gladdening hour; For who are they in yon square border tower Half up the hill? and in the cottage near Whose is the old grey face so tender and so dear? XVI My weal had been their last and only stake In life's decline; and doubt and fear and pain Long, largely had they suffered for my sake: To them whose hearts did never touch profane Of worldly cares corrode or pleasures stain, (How peaceful but for me!) at length I brought The charm that soothed to rest full many an anxious thought. XVII Thou garrulous stream, my youth's companion sweet, In earlier years if I have loved thee well, In after years if oft my faithful feet Assiduously have sought thy sylvan dell, If to my heart thy voluble voice can tell So much so softly, am I wrong to raise My voice above thine own in publishing thy praise? ERNESTO. Thoughtfully by the side Ernesto sate Of her whom, in his earlier youth, with heart Then first exulting in a dangerous hope, Dearer for danger, he had rashly loved. That was a season when the untravell'd spirit, Not way-worn nor way-wearied, nor with soil Nor stain upon it, lions in its path Saw none,—or seeing, with triumphant trust In its resources and its powers, defied,— Perverse to find provocatives in warnings And in disturbance taking deep delight. By sea or land he then saw rise the storm With a gay courage, and through broken lights Tempestuously exalted, for awhile His heart ran mountains high, or to the roar Of shatter'd forests sang superior songs With kindling, and what might have seem'd to some, Auspicious energy:—by land and sea He was way-founder'd—trampled in the dust His many-colour'd hopes—his lading rich Of precious pictures, bright imaginations, In absolute shipwreck to the winds and waves Suddenly render'd. By her side he sate: But time had been between and wov'n a veil Of seven years' separation, and the past Was seen with soften'd outlines, like the face Of nature through a mist. What was so seen? In a short hour, there sitting with his eyes Fix'd on her face, observant though abstracted, Lost partly in the past, but mixing still With his remembrances the life before him, He traced it all—the pleasant first accost, Agreeable acquaintance, growing friendship, Love, passion at the culminating point When in a sleeping body through the night The heart would lie awake, reverses next Gnawing the mind with doubtfulness, and last The affectionate bitterness of love refused. —Rash had he been by choice—by wanton choice Deliberately rash; but in the soil Where grows the bane, grows too the antidote; The same young-heartedness which knew not fear Renounced despondency, and brought at need With its results, resources. In his day Of utter condemnation there remain'd Appeal to that imaginative power Which can commute a sentence of sore pain For one of softer sadness, which can bathe The broken spirit in the balm of tears;— And more and better to after days; for soon Upsprang the mind within him, and he knew The affluence and the growth which nature yields After an overflow of loving grief. Hence did he deem that he could freely draw A natural indemnity. The tree Sucks kindlier nurture from a soil enrich'd By its own fallen leaves; and man is made In heart and spirit from deciduous hopes And things that seem to perish. Through the stress And fever of his suit, from first to last, His pride (to call it by no nobler name) Had been to love with reason and with truth, To carry clear through many a turbulent trial A perspicacious judgment and true tongue, And neither with fair word nor partial thought To flatter whom he loved. If pride it was To love and not to flatter, by a breath Of purer aspiration was he moved To suffer and not blame, grieve, not resent, And when all hopes that needs must knit with self Their object, were irrevocably gone, Cherish a mild commemorative love, Such as a mourner might unblamed bestow On a departed spirit. Once again He sate beside her—for the last time now: And scarcely was she alter'd; for the hours Had led her lightly down the vale of life, Dancing and scattering roses, and her face Seem'd a perpetual daybreak, and the woods Where'er she rambled, echoed through their aisles The music of a laugh so softly gay That spring with all her songsters and her songs Knew nothing like it. But how changed was he! Care and disease, and ardours unrepress'd, And labours unremitted, and much grief, Had written their death-warrant on his brow. Of this she saw not all—she saw but little— That which she could not choose but see she saw— And o'er her sunlit dimples and her smiles A shadow fell—a transitory shade— And when the phantom of a hand she clasp'd At parting, scarce responded to her touch, She sigh'd—but hoped the best. When winter came She sigh'd again; for with it came the word That trouble and love had found their place of rest And slept beneath Madeira's orange groves. To V.R. Victoria, by the grace of God Of Loveland and of Joyland Queen, The path that heretofore you trod A dainty primrose path has been: And whither next? Makes answer Hope, “The generations of the days Have travell'd up a sunny slope To lose themselves in golden haze; “But Love and Innocence are strong,— What hath been shall be, they and I Asseverate,—and to us belong Some natural gifts of prophecy.” So Hope: a dear young friend of ours, Dear when she drinks the morning dew, Dear when she shines through evening showers, And dearest when she tells of you! ODE. I. Time was, Virginia, when the poem made By passionate Nature in creating you Like to a minister of flame had play'd Around my path, and wheresoe'er I stray'd Had open'd to my view The earth in robes of purple light array'd And gemm'd with morning dew. II. Those times return not—let them not return— But let me not forget that once they were; Far be from me that Fancy's age should err In quest of guerdons youth alone can earn; But must I therefore cease to yearn After the mood when evening notes prolong Some distant echoes of the matin song? O Nature! sedulous to read Thy lore, shall I thy sway dispute? No, let my Being still proceed Involving all, seed, flower, and fruit, The current still recur— No, let me still hold fast Treasures of old amass'd, And in Imagination's votive urn Let me, with rites more sad than stern, Deposit only, not inter, The ashes of the bright and beautiful Past. III. Strong are the hours and days; Youth's mortal part decays; But there are powers on earth more strong than Time: Give me your hand, Virginia; we will go To where the old streams carol as they flow (Whilst the late-blown blossoms bend To list the strain that ne'er shall end) Telling of many a charm and many a rhyme Born ere your birth, when I was in my prime. IV. The Morning Stars together sang, With chaunted loves the woodlands rang, When, in the glorious solitude of dawn, I walk'd, and made the earth that I beheld: Whether by native power impell'd From inward germ the brain-creation sprang, Or by constructive force was deftly drawn From flower-crown'd ruins of poetic Eld; Whether to secret wood-embosom'd lawn I summon'd Satyr, Nymph, and Faun, Or call'd up shapes divine Seen of no eye but mine (Though to some shape of this Earth's brood Bearing belike a sweet similitude), Or saw through rocky rift of mountain range Far off a blue and sunny sea And full in sail a carrack bound to me, Charged with a freight of something rich and strange, Words, spells, and witcheries, with power endued To build me up a name Of perdurable fame, Which should not suffer wrong by death or change. V. Gone—gone, Virginia, are both dawn and noon; Yet fled they not too swiftly nor too soon: Much they found of what they sought, Much they left of what they brought: God speed them! for in yonder evening sky As bright a vision meets as charm'd an eye. I see again in heaven's own texture wrought The sea of sunniest blue, The carrack full in view, The mountain range, the rocky rift, Ethereal lawns of softest green Sequester'd and serene, And woods where Fauns and Satyrs lift Their shaggy long-ear'd heads the boughs between. And not in colour'd clouds descried, But here in substance verified, Shines forth a living mind in such a mien As Fancy may have sometimes seen When wandering in her youth through kingdoms wide She dream'd a dream of Faëry Land and sigh'd After the Faëry Queen. VI. Farewell! The mood is past: Fair friend, adieu! The mood is past; but I have owed to you A flash of light that in the abyss profound Show'd me forgotten forms. They sleep—they sleep— But not in death. Deep calleth unto Deep. Farewell! a blessing treads upon the ground You tread; your very breath a blessing breathes; And in the regions where the lost is found My youth and yours shall meet: That forecast sheathes A sharp regret, and stills an idle sound.</field>
