      <field name="fulltext">Songs to 4. voyces [I. The man vpright of life] The man vpright of life The man vpright of life whose guiltles heart is free from all dishonest deeds from al dishonest deedes, or thought of vanitie, that man whose silent dayes in harmeles ioyes are spent, whom hopes cannot delude, delude, nor sorrow discontent, whom hopes c?not delude, whom hopes cannot delude, nor sorrow discontent, that man needs neither towers nor armor for defence, nor secret vautes to flie, from thunders violence, nor secret vautes to flie to flie from thunders violence. [II. He onely can behold] He onely can behold He onely can behold behold he onely can behold with vnaffrighted eyes, the horrors of the deep, &amp; terrors of the skies, the horrors of the deep, &amp; terrors of the skies. Thus scorning scorning, scorning all the cares that fate or fortune brings. He makes his heau? his booke, he makes his heauen his booke, his wisedome heauenly thinges good thoughts his onely friendes, his onely friendes, his wealth a well spent age, the earth his sober Inne, &amp; quiet pilgrimage. [III. O heauy hart whose harms are hid] O heauy hart whose harms are hid thy helpe is hurt O heauy hart whose harms are hid thy helpe is hurt, thy hap is hard, if thou shouldst break, as God forbid then should desert want his reward, hope wel; to haue, hate not sweete thought, sweete thought, fowle cruell storms; foule cruell storms fairer calmes haue brought, fairer calmes haue brought, after sharpe showers the sun shines fairer, hope cums likewise after dispaire, after sharpe showers, the sunne shines faire hope cums likewise after dispaire. [IIII In hope a king doth go to war] In hope a king doth go to war In hope a king doth go to war, in hope a king doth go to war, in hope a louer liues ful long, in hope a marchant sailes ful far, in hope iust men do suffer wrong, iust men do suffer wrong, in hope the plowman sowes his seede, thus hope helps thousands at their neede, then saint not hart among the rest, what euer chance hope thou the best; what euer ch?ce hope thou the best. [V Though wit bids wil to blow retreate] Though wit bids wil to blow retreate Though wit bids wil to blow retreate to blow retreait will cannot worke as wit would wish, when that the Roch doth taste the bait too late, to warne the hungrie fish, when Cities burn on fierie flame, on fiery flame great riuers scarse may quench the same, If will and fancy be agreede, agreede, too late for wit to bid take heed to bid take heed, to late for wit to bid take heed. [VI. Bvt yet it seems a foolish drift] Bvt yet it seems a foolish drift Bvt yet it seems a foolish drift, it seemes a foolish drift, to follow wil, &amp; leaue the wit the wanton, want? horse that runs too swift, that runs too swift, may well bee staid, may well be stayed vpon the bit, but checke a horse amid his race, and out of doubt you mar his pace, though wit &amp; reason doth men teach, neuer to clime abouetheir reach neuer to clime aboue their reach. [VII. I can no more but hope good hart] I can no more but hope good hart I can no more but hope good hart, no more but hope good hart, for thogh the worst doth ch?ce to fal, I know a wile shal ease thy smart, a wile shall ease thy smart &amp; turne to sweete thy sugred gall, when thy good will and painfull suite hath shakt the tree and wants the fruit then keepe thou patience well in store, that souraigne salue shall heale thysore, that soueraigne salue shall heale thy sore. [VIII. Who loues this life] Who loues this life from loue Who loues this life from loue his loue doth erre &amp; chusing drosse rich treasure doth denie, leauing the pearle Christs counsell to prefer with selling all, we haue the same to buy O happy soule that doth disburse a sum, to gain a Kingdome in the life in the life to come, to gaine a Kingdome in the life to come, O happie soule that doth disburse a sum, to gaine a kingdom in the life to come, to gaine, a kingdom in the life to com, to gain a kingdom in the life to com, a kingd? in the life to com [IX. My prime of youth is but a frost of cares] My prime of youth is but a frost of cares My prime of youth is but a frost of cares, my feast of ioy is but a dish of paine, a dish of pain, my crop of corne is but a field of tares and all my good is but vain hope of gaine, vaine hope of gaine, my life is fled is fled, &amp; yet I saw no sun, &amp; now I liue, and now now now, now my life my life is done, my life is fled is fled, and yet I saw no sunne, and now I liue, &amp; now now now, my life, my life is done. [X. The spring is past] The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung, the fruit is dead and yet the leaues be greene, the leaues be greene, my youth is gone, and yet I am but yong, I saw the world, and yet I was not seen, yet I was not seen, my threed is cut, &amp; yet it is not spun, it is not spun and now I liue and now now now now now now my life my life is done, my threed is cut, &amp; yet it is not spun, and yet it is not spun, &amp; now I liue, &amp; now &amp; now now now now my life is done, my life is done.

Rest with your selues] Rest with your selues you vaine and idle braines Rest with your selues you vaine and idle braines which youth and age in lewdest lust bestow, which youth and age in lewdest lust bestow and find out frauds and vse ten thousand traines to win the soyle where nought but sin doth grow and liue with me you chast and honest mindes which do, your liues in lawfull loue employ employ, &amp; know no sleights, but friends for vertue finds' and loath the lust, which doth the soule destroy. [XII. For lust is fraile] For lust is fraile, where loue is euer sound For lust is fraile, where loue is euer sound, lust outward sweet, but inward bitter gall, a shop of shewes where no good ware is found, not like to loue, where honest faith is all, so that is lust, where fancy ebs and flowes &amp; hates and loues as beauty dyes and grows, and this is loue, where friendship firmly stands on vertues rock, &amp; not on sinful sands, &amp; not on sinful sands. [XIII. Shall I abide this ieasting] Shall I abide this ieasting Shall I abide this ieasting, I weepe, and shees a feasting, shall I abide this ieasting, I weepe and shees a feasting, O cruell cruell fancy, that so doth blinde thee to loue one doth not mind thee; that so doth blind thee to loue one to loue one doth not mind thee, that so doth blind thee to loue one doth not mind thee, that so doth blind thee so blind thee, to loue to loue one doth not mind thee.
