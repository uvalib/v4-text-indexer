      <field name="fulltext">THE OMNIPRESENCE OF THE DEITY. “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?—If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold Thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.” —Psalm cxxxix. 7–10. “Thou sole Transcendency! and deep Abyss From whence the universe of life was drawn, Unutter'd is Thy nature—to Thyself alone The fathom'd, proved, and comprehended God!” PART I. ANALYSIS OF PART I. The Poem opens with an apostrophe to the Deity— He was, ere Time began—Vision of the Creation— We cannot escape the Omnipresent God—He pervades all things—Allusion to His appearance on Mount Sinai—The Red Sea—Nature attests the presence of her Architect—The impossibility of perfectly tracing the Deity's influence: we can only select those scenes which impressively demonstrate it—The thunder—the ocean-tempest—The Presence of the Deity felt in the repose of Nature— The calm which succeeds a storm — Aspirations awakened by a view of the setting sun. The hand of God is next traced in a rapid view of the Seasons:—Spring—Mountains—Sacred feclings kindled by the sight of an august ruin—The Convalescent—The. Heavens—A moonlight walk—The soul conscious of its celestial origin—Every clime an object of the Deity's care — Condensed view of His providence—Not only nature, but human life, in all its diversified forms, regulated by Him. But there is a far sublimer sense in which a Christian enjoys a Divine Presence in creation, and therefore, this part of the poem is concluded by a consideration of the doctrine which Christianity reveals, by whose light the glory of nature is rendered more glorious, and all the beauty of outward things becomes a symbol of that which is unscen. Thou Uncreate, Unseen, and Undefined, Source of all life, and fountain of the mind; Pervading Spirit, whom no eye can trace, Felt through all time, and working in all space, Imagination cannot paint that spot, Around, above, beneath, where Thou art not! Before the glad stars hymn'd to new-born earth, Or young creation revell'd in its birth, Thy Spirit moved upon the pregnant deep, Unchain'd the waveless waters from their sleep, Bade Time's majestic wings to be unfurl'd, And out of darkness drew the breathing World. Primeval Power! before Thy thunder rang, And Nature from eternity outsprang; Ere matter form'd at Thy creative tone, Thou wert; Almighty, Endless, and Alone: In Thine own Essence, all that was to be,— Sublime, unfathomable Deity: Thou saidst—and lo! a universe was born, And Light flash'd from Thee, for her birth-day morn. The Earth unshrouded all her beauty now; The kingly mountain bared his awful brow, Flowers, fruits, and trees felt instantaneous life:— But, hark, creation trembles with the strife Of roaring waves in wild commotion hurl'd,— 'Tis Ocean winding round the rocking world! And next, triumphant o'er the green-clad earth, The universal Sun burst into birth, And dash'd from off his altitude sublime The first dread ray that mark'd commencing time! Last, came the Moon upon the wings of light, And sat in glory on the throne of night, While, young and fresh, a radiant host of stars Wheel'd round the heavens upon their burning cars. But all was dismal as a world of dead, Till the great Deep her living swarms outspread: Forth from her teeming bosom, sudden came Uncounted monsters,—mighty, without name; Then, thick as dews upon a twilight green, The living creatures rose upon the scene. Creation's master-piece! a breath of God, Ray of His glory, quicken'd at His nod, Immortal Man came next, divinely grand, Glorious and perfect from his Maker's hand; Last, softly beautiful as Music's close, Angelic Woman into being rose. And now, the gorgeous universe was rife, Full, fair, and glowing with created life; And when th' Eternal, from His starry height, Beheld the young world basking in His light, And breathing incense of deep gratitude, He bless'd it,—for His mercy made it good. And thus, Thou wert, and art, the Fountain Soul, And countless worlds around Thee live and roll; In sun and shade, in ocean and in air Diffused, yet undiminish'd—everywhere: All life and motion from Thy source began, From worlds to atoms, Angels down to Man. Lord of all being! where can Fancy fly, To what far realms, unmeasur'd by Thine eye? Where can we hide beneath Thy blazing sun, Where dwell'st Thou not, the boundless, viewless One? Shall Guilt couch down within the cavern's gloom, And quiv'ring, groaning, meditate her doom? Or scale the mountains, where the whirlwinds rest, And in the night-blast cool her fiery breast?— Within the cavern-gloom Thine eye can see, The sky-clad mountains lift their heads to Thee; Thy Spirit rides upon the thunder-storms, Dark'ning the skies into terrific forms! Beams in the lightning, rocks upon the seas, Roars in the blast, and whispers in the breeze; In calm and storm, in Heaven and Earth Thou art, Trace but Thy works—they bring Thee to the heart! The fulness of Thy Presence who can see? Man cannot live, great God! and look on Thee; Around Thy path the quenchless lightnings glow,— Thy Voice appals the shudd'ring world below. Oh, Egypt felt Thee, when, by signs unscared, To mock Thy might the rebel monarch dared: Thou look'dst—and Ocean sever'd at the glance! Undaunted, still the charioteers advance; Thou look'dst again—she clash'd her howling waves, And Storms in triumph revell'd o'er their graves! On Sinai's mountain when Thy glory came In rolls of thunder, and in clouds of flame; There, while volcanie smoke Thy throne o'ercast, And the mount shrunk beneath the trumpet-blast, How did thy Symbol blind all Israel's eye, How dreadful were the gleams of Deity! There is a voiceless eloquence on Earth, Telling of Him who gave her wonders birth; And long may I remain th' adoring child Of Nature's majesty, sublime or wild; Hill, flood, and forest, mountain, rock, and sea, All take their terrors, or their charms from Thee, From Thee, whose hidden but supreme control Moves through the world—a universal Soul. But who could trace Thine unrestricted course, Though fancy followed with immortal force? There's not a blossom fondled by the breeze, There's not a fruit that beautifies the trees, There's not a particle in sea or air But Nature owns Thy plastic influence there! With gaze devout still be it mine to see How all is fill'd and vivified by Thee; On the vast scene of earth's majestic view, To paint Thy glories, and to feel them too. Ye giant Winds! that from your gloomy sleep Rise in your wrath, and revel on the deep; Lightnings! which are the mystic gleams of God, That glanced when on the sacred mount he trod; And ye, black Thunders! that begird His form, Pealing your loud hosannahs o'er the storm; Around me rally in concentred might, And strike my being with a dread delight; Sublimely musing, let me pause and see, And pour my awe-struck soul, O God! to Thee. A thunder-storm!—the eloquence of heaven, When the thick clouds, like airy walls are riven, Who hath not paused beneath its hollow groan, And felt omnipotence around him thrown? With what a gloom the ush'ring Scene appears! The leaves all fluttering with instinctive fears, The waters curling with a fellow dread, A breezeless fervour round creation spread, And, last, the heavy rain's reluctant shower, With big drops patt'ring on the tree and bower, While wizard shapes the bowing sky deform,— All mark the coming of a Thunder-storm. Oh, now to be alone, on some vast height, Where heaven's black curtains terrify the sight, And watch the clouds together meet and clash, While fierce-wing'd lightnings from their conflict flash; To see the caverns of the sky disclose The buried flames that in their wombs repose, And mark the lurid meteors fall and rise, In dizzy chase along the rattling skies,— How quakes the Spirit while the echoes roll, And God, in thunder, speaks from pole to pole! And thou, weird Ocean! on whose awful face Time's iron feet can print no ruin-trace, By breezes lull'd, or by the storm-blasts driven, Thy tow'ring waves uplift the mind to heaven. Tremendous art Thou! in thy tempest-ire, When the mad surges to the clouds respire, And like new Apennines from out the sea, Thy waves march on in mountain-majesty. Oh! never can the dark-souled Atheist stand, And watch the breakers boiling on the strand, Nor feel Religion from the sea arise, And preach to conscience what his will denies; His heart is wiser than his head would be, And awe instinctive tells, O God, of Thee! He hears Him in the wind-heav'd ocean's roar, Hurling her billowy crags upon the shore; He hears Him in the horror of the blast, And shakes while rush the raving whirlwinds past! But not alone, when waves and whirlwinds rise, And wing their voices through the startled skies; Not in the storm, the thunder, or the sea, Alone we feel thy dread ubiquity: In calmer scenes, and the unruffled hour, Our still'd hearts own Thine omnipresent power. List! now the cradled winds have hush'd their roar, And infant waves curl gamb'ling to the shore, While Nature seems to wake up fresh and clear As Hope emerging from the gloom of fear, And the bright dew-bead on the verdure lies, Like liquid rapture upon beauty's eyes,— How heavenly 'tis to take our pensive range, And mark 'tween storm and calm the lovely change! First comes the sun, unveiling half its face, Like a coy virgin, with reluctant grace, While dark clouds skirted with a slanting ray Roll, one by one, in azure depths away, Till pearly shapes, like molten billows, lie Along the tinted bosom of the sky: Next, breezes murmur with harmonious charm, Panting and wild, like orphans of the storm; Now sipping flowers, now making blossoms shake, Or weaving ripples on the grass-green lake; And thus, the Tempest dies: and soft, and still, The rainbow drops upon the distant hill: But now, while bloom and breeze their charms unite, And all is glowing with a rich delight, God! who can tread upon the breathing ground, Nor feel Thee present, where Thy smiles abound? When Day hath glided to his rosy bower, And twilight comes—the Poet's witching hour, And dream-like language from the soft-toned wind With pensive cadence charms the list'ning mind, Then nature's beauty, clothed with dewy light, Melts on the heart like music through the night. And not in vain, voluptuous Eventide, Thy dappled clouds along th'horizon glide; For oh! while heaven and earth grow dumb with bliss In homage to an hour divine as this, How sweet, upon yon mountain's azure brow, While ruddy sun-beams gild the crags below, To stand, and mark with meditative view, Where the far ocean faints in hazy blue, While on the bosom of the midway deep The emerald waves in dimpling splendour leap; Here, as we view the gorgeous Priest of time, Wrapp'd in a shroud of glory, sink sublime, Thoughts of ethereal beauty spring to birth, And waft the soul beyond the dreams of earth. And who hath gazed upon the bright-wing'd Morn, Breezy and fresh, from out the ocean born; Her rich-wove cloud-wreaths, and the rainbow hues From heaven reflected on creation's views; Or mark'd the wonders of a day depart, Nor felt a heaven-caught influence at his heart? Through all the seasons' varying course of love, Who hath not traced the Spirit from above? The howl of Winter in the leafless wood; The ice-bound torrent, and the whelming flood; Or Summer's flush, or Autumn, robed in grey, Whirling the red leaves round her bleak-worn way,— All tell one tale of Heaven. But thou, young Spring! Glad as the wild bee on his glossy wing, Bedeck'd with bloom, and breathing life around, Within thy breast Elysian charms abound. The mercy-fountains of Divinity Now stream through all, with vigour full and free; As if unloosen'd from their living source, To carry with them spring's creative force. The sky is garlanded with waves of blue, Like ocean dawning on the distant view; The sun lies mirror'd on the radiant streams, The sea-waves gambol in his noontide beams, The boughs hang glitt'ring in their locks of green, And airy poets carol to the scene; While sea, and sky, and land, and fragrant Earth With her rich promise budding into birth,— Seem, like a heart o'erfill'd with sacred love, Glowing with gratitude to Him above. Terrific giants that o'erlook the sea, Enormous masses of sublimity, Ye mountain-piles! Earth's monuments to Heaven, Around whose brows the reeling storms are driven, Whether in climes where 'bove the ice-chain'd deep Ye rise in piles magnificently steep, Or where in living bloom your bosoms swell, And fierce and far the headlong torrents yell,— Where snow-drifts whiten, or where sunbeams warm, Your brows are girdled with almighty charm! When drops the sun in yonder western deep, The waves unruffled, and the winds asleep; And isles of beauty float the brilliant sky, While Fancy muses with enamour'd eye; Then comes the hour to fascinate the sight, Where the wild mountain rears its massy height. There, as we gaze, mysterious thoughts begin To stir th' immortal spark that burns within; Till Wonder starts with a bewild'ring fear, As if the advent of our God were near! And where, beneath the stern decree of time, Columns and temples sink in age sublime; Where by the ruin'd battlements are heard The wailing sorrows of some midnight bird, While low winds mutter through the roofless halls, And ivy-boughs bend weeping o'er the walls, Imagination loves to stand and dream, And mark yon ruin in the moonlight gleam, Till summon'd Ages startle from their sleep, And plaintive Mem'ry turns aside to weep!— Or view, when sunset drinks the forest-breeze, Where some grey abbey glimmers through the trees, And on the turrets evening's pallid rays Gleam like the glory of departed days, How soon the cloister'd stillness of the spot Brings heaven around us, till the world's forgot; While Retrospection draws the moral sigh, And dreams embodied move before her eye. Great Architect of worlds! whose forming power Presided o'er creation's natal hour, Stamp'd man Thy miniature, and bade him run A race of glory, till his goal be won; When wan Disease exhales her withering breath, And dims his beauty with the damp of death; At some still hour the holy sigh will swell, The gushing tear of gratitude will tell That Thou art by, to temper and to tame The trembling anguish of the fever'd frame. But oh! when heal'd by love and heaven, we rise, With radiant cheek, and re-illumin'd eyes, Bright as a new-born sun, all nature beams, And through the spirit darts immortal dreams. Now for the bracing hills, and healthful plains, And pensive ramble when the noontide wanes; Now for the walk beside some haunted wood, And fancy-music of a distant flood; While far and wide, the wand'ring eye surveys, And the heart pants to pour away its praise! But, turn from earth to yonder glorious sky, Th' imagin'd dwelling-place of Deity. Ye quenchless Stars! so eloquently bright, Ye radiant Watchers of reposing night, While half the world is lapp'd in blissful dreams And round the lattice creep your fairy beams, How sweet to gaze upon your placid eyes, In lambent beauty looking from the skies! And when, oblivious of the world, we stray At dead of night along some noiscless way, How the Heart mingles with a moon-lit hour, And feels from heaven a sympathetic power!— See, not a cloud careers yon pathless deep Of molten azure,—mute as lovely sleep; Full in her pallid light the Moon presides, Shrined in a halo, mellowing as she rides; And far around, the forest and the stream Wear the rich garment of her silver beam. The lull'd Winds, too, are sleeping in their caves, No stormy prelude rolls upon the waves; Nature is hush'd, as if her works adored The night-felt presence of creation's Lord. And now, while through the ocean-mantling haze A mournful lustre tremulously plays, And glimm'ring loveliness hath veil'd the land, Go, stranger, muse thou by the wave-worn strand: Cent'ries have glided o'er the balanced earth, Myriads have bless'd, and myriads curs'd their birth; Still, beauteously yon starry watchers glare, Unsullied as the God who throned them there! Though moral earthquakes heave th' astounded world, And king and kingdom from their pride are hurl'd, Intensely calm, they hold their bright career, Unheedful of the storms and changes here:— We want no hymn to hear, nor pomp to see, For all around is felt divinity! The wing'd heart flutters to ascend above To Him whose nature and whose name are Love. And if revered ones, from their hallow'd sphere, May witness warm Affection's faithful tear, At this deep hour they hear the mourner's sigh, And waft a blessing from their homes on high. Stupendous God! how shrinks our bounded sense To track the triumphs of Omnipotence; From sky-clad mountain, to the deepest den, From the mean insects, to immortal men; Bless'd with Thy brightest smile, dare we confine Paternal Providence, supreme as thine? Far as the fancy flies, or life-stream flows, From Georgia's desert to the Greenland snows, Where space exists, Thine eyes of mercy see,— Creation lives, and moves, and breathes in Thee! Unseen, but felt, Thine interfused Control Works in each atom, and pervades the whole; Expands the blossom, and erects the tree, Conducts each vapour, and commands each sea; The Laws of Nature Thy decree fulfil, And all Her powers but realise Thy will. E'en now, while tragic Midnight walks the land, And spreads the wings of darkness with her wand, What scenes are witness'd by Thy watchful eye, What millions waft to Thee the prayer and sigh! Some gaily vanish to an unfear'd grave, Fleet as the sun-flash o'er a summer-wave; Some wear out life in smiles, and some in tears, Some dare with hope, while others droop with fears; The vagrant's roaming in his tatter'd vest, The babe is sleeping on its mother's breast; The captive mutt'ring o'er his rust-worn chain, The widow weeping for her lord again, While many a Mourner shuts his languid eye, To dream of heaven, and view it ere he die,— And yet, no sigh can swell, no tear-drop fall, But Thou wilt see, and guide, and solace all! And thus, a Preacher of eternal might, Sublime in darkness, or array'd in light, In each wild change of glory, gloom, and storm, The starry magic, and the mountain-form, Art thou,—dread Universe of love and power! But, higher still the Muse's wing may tower, And track the myst'ry of almighty ways, Through paths that glitter with the solemn rays The awful noon of revelation shed From Calv'ry,—when the God Incarnate bled. For what is Nature, though religion seems To lend a tone to all her winds and streams; To whisper, God! when night and darkness creep Round the dim trances of Creation's sleep; To teach a prayer when twilight hush descends, And the mute bough in adoration bends; Or bid the woods a leafy anthem raise When the rich verdure shines with emerald rays: Or spring, the Angel of the seasons, pours A tide of beauty round exulting shores: Say, what is meant?—a soft mysterious glow, A breath too pure to live on earth below, An evanescent luxury of thought, Cull'd from the feast Imagination brought,— But, frail and feeble, as the charm that dies, When the dead waken upon mem'ry's eyes. When lived the Age, or where the clime so rude, What island nursed in billowy solitude, Where dreams of God were never known to shine Round a dark soul, with imagery divine? The Heathen through his cloud of error saw, A faint reflection of celestial Law; E'en the grim savage, when his eye commands A broad extent of green-apparel'd lands, Or views the Tempest wave his cloudy wing In sultry darkness o'er the world of spring, Can hail the image of some dreamt Unknown,— A sceptred BEING on his boundless throne. Then boast not thou, whose spell-bound eye can see In nature's glass reflected Deity; From whence does moral elevation flow, What pang is mute, what balm prepared for wo, Though ocean, mountain, sky, and air impress Full on the soul a felt Almightiness? Can Ocean teach magnificence of mind? Is truth made vocal by the deep-voiced Wind? Can flowers their bloom of innocence impart, Or tempt one weed of vileness from the heart? Can thy benevolence, all bounteous Sun, Thou burning Shadow of the brightest One! Array our souls with emulative beam Like thine, to glad life's universal stream? From yon pale stars does purity descend, And their chaste beauty with our spirit blend?— Alas, oh, God! if Thou alone art found When most creation with Thy smile is crown'd; Rather in blindness let this outward eye Be dead to nature, than Thy throne deny, Raised on the pillars of Redemption's might, And dazzling angels with too deep a light! There is a Presence spiritually vast Around Thy Church, arisen Saviour! cast; A holy Effluence, an unspoken Awe, A Sanctity which carnal eye ne'er saw, A pure, impalpable, almighty Sense Of peace, by reconciled Omnipotence, Which hallows, haunts, and makes a Christian mind Rich in all grace, celestially refined: Mere Nature's worshippers can never feel The fulness of that high seraphic zeal Which veileth all things with religious light, And works unwearied in Jehovah's sight: Thought, dream, and action,—ev'ry pulse of soul The awe of Christ will solemnly control; Girt by The Spirit, wheresoe'er we rove, True Faith is feeding on His word of love. Nature is now a more than nature far; Each miracle of sun, or moon, or star, Each sight, and sense, and sound of outward things, Seems haunted by august imaginings; A dream of Calvary around her floats, And oft the dew of those delicious notes By angels once in Bethlehem's valley pour'd Descends, with all their melody restored, Till peace on earth! to pardon'd man good will! With tones of heaven the ear of fancy fill. PART II. “Of finer mould, and far sublimer view, Whate'er his lot; on Fortune's envied mount High-throned, or lost in the secluded vales Of lowliness, is he whose hopes are built In Heaven:— Not all the pomp and pageantry of worlds Reflects such glory on the Eye Supreme, As the meek virtue of one holy man!— For even doth his angel from the face Divine, beatitude and wisdom draw.” ANALYSIS OF PART II. The second part of the Poem is devoted to a consideration of the Presence of the Deity, as influencing Human Life—In our journey through the world, we cannot but admit an overruling Power—The paternal care of the Deity—Consolation thence derived in scenes of woe—Pictures of a street-wanderer and an exiled captive—The hopes imparted to the soldier, by his confidence in the presence of God—The Sailor—Storm and wreck described—His consciousness of Preserving Providence. As misfortune is observed by God, so, in like manner, the crimes of the wicked cannot escape Him— Picture of a murderer—Darkness; its varied influence depicted—Penitence—The young convict—The maniac boy—The arctic traveller—The missionary. The Sabbath—Feelings excited by the tones of an organ swelling through a cathedral—The village christening—Rapid survey of the common lot. As God has been defined “Love,” we may be assured that He eminently favours virtuous affection—The marriage scene—Raptures arising from the retrospections of the virtuous—Picture of a grandsire, sitting by his winter fire, and retracing the scenes of his life—Friendship. Death — Apostrophe — Picture of a dying old man, attended by his daughter — The Funeral — The Almighty Presence. Along the barren world as doom'd we roam By devious paths to one perennial Home, In tears or smiles we own the o'erruling Hand That beckons on to that celestial Land, Where, harbour'd all, life's billows sink away, And the bright spirits bask in heaven's immortal ray. And happy thou! through all the change of time, Whom sorrow cannot burden with a crime; Whose joyless heart and never-lighten'd care Can nobly scorn the refuge of despair. Like ocean's wand'rer guided by his star, Thy heaven-taught spirit looks to him afar. Say, ye whose hearts unburden'd can enjoy The bliss of life, without the world's alloy; What can illume their melancholy way, Where Want begins, and Mis'ry crowns the day? When bow'd by woe, and bleach'd by with'ring age, Alone Life's orphan treads the world's cold stage; His fortune wreck'd, his friends beneath the sod, Where shall he fly, but to the arms of God? Blest be yon viewless Spirit thron'd on high, No heart's too wretched to attract His eye; No lot too lowly to engage His love, And win the smile of Mercy from above! He gazes on the sleepless couch of wo, And bids the dying light of hope to glow, Unarms the peril, heals the wounded mind, And charms each feeling home, to fate resign'd. At wintry eve, when savage night-winds blow, Pierce his cold cheek, and drift his locks of snow, As oft the vagrant shivers through the street, No voice to pity, and no hand to greet, With many a pause he marks that window-pane, Whose flick'ring blaze recalls his home again! The friend and face, the music and the mirth, And social magic of his evening-hearth, A waked by mem'ry, warm his widow'd heart, Till real woes in fancied bliss depart; And one by one, as happier days appear, To each he pays the homage of a tear; Though homeless, still he loves home's joyous glare, Looks up to heaven, and feels his home is there! Within a dungeon, mildew'd by the night, Barr'd from salubrious air and cheering light, Lo! the pale captive pines in hostile lands, Chain'd to his doom by adamantine bands. Oh, how he pants to face the fresh-wing'd breeze, And hear the voices of the summer trees: To breathe, and live, and move, and be as free As Nature is, and Man was made to be! And when at night, upon his flinty bed, Silent and sad, he lays his grief-worn head, There as the dungeon-bell, with dismal sound, Tolls midnight through the sleeping air around, Remembrance wafts him to paternal climes, And frames a fairy world of happier times. The woodland haunts around his native scene, The village dance upon the festive green, His sloping garden where he lov'd to ply, And smiled as peeping flower-buds hail'd his eye, His beauteous partner and her blue-eyed boy, Who prattled, played, and fed his soul with joy,— By thought created, crowd around his heart, And force the pangs of fond regret to start; Each soft delusion claims a genial sigh, Each dream of happiness bedims his eye; Till, warm'd by Heaven, his home-wed bosom glows With hopes that triumph o'er remember'd woes; And far away the chainless spirit flies, To vision'd realms of rest beyond the skies. Spirit of Light and Life! when Battle rears His fiery brow amid terrific spears; When deathful cannons to the clouds uproar, And gasping hosts sleep shrouded in their gore, E'en then, th' intrepid Heart that nobly glows To face the fury of invading foes, May look to Thee for mercy and for power, To brave the peril of the carnage-hour; Or, doom'd to fall amid the furious din, While battle storms without, may find a peace within. List! war-peals thunder on the battle-field; And many a hand grasps firm the glitt'ring shield, As on, with helm and plume, the warriors come, And the glad hills repeat the stormy drum! And now are seen the youthful and the grey, With bosoms burning to partake the fray: The first, with hearts that consecrate the deed, All eager rush to vanquish or to bleed; Like young waves racing in the morning sun, That rear and leap with reckless fury on! But, see that scar-worn man, who looks on high With musing valour mirror'd in his eye; Not all the bleeding revels of the day Can fright the vision of his home away; The home of love, and its attractive smiles, His wife's endearment, and his baby's wiles:— Fights he less brave through recollected bliss, With step retreating, or with sword remiss? Ah no! remember'd home's the warrior's charm, Speed to his sword, and vigour to his arm; For this he supplicates the God afar, Fronts the steel'd foe, and mingles in the war. The cannon's hush'd!—nor drum nor clarion sound; Helmet and hauberk mingle on the ground; Horseman and horse lie welt'ring in their gore; Patriots are dead, and heroes dare no more; While solemnly the moonlight shrouds the plain, And lights the lurid features of the slain. And see! where swift the banner'd coursers past, A battle-steed beneath his rider cast; Oh! never more he'll rear with fierce delight, Roll his large eyes, and rally for the fight; Pale on that bleeding corse a warrior lies, While from the ruffled lids his white-swell'd eyes Ghastly and grimly stare upon the skies! But who, upon the battle-wasted plain, Shall count the faint, the gasping, and the slain? Angel of Mercy! ere the blood-fount chill, And the brave heart be spiritless and still, Amid the havoc Thou art hov'ring nigh, To calm each groan, and close each dying eye, And waft the spirit to that halcyon shore, Where war's loud thunders lash the winds no more. And on Thy deep, the girdle of the world, When the fierce Hurricanoes have unfurl'd Their thousand wings, to battle and to rave, Sweep down the rock and scourge the yelling wave; When skies in tempest-agonies outgroan, And the mad elements seem left alone, Lord of the Storm! oh, Thou art present there, In the loud thunder, and the lightning-glare, While from the rollings of unfathom'd sea A mariner's last sigh ascends to Thee. Lo! to the yellow beach a maiden hies, Love at her heart, and sorrow in her eyes. Warm down her cheek impassion'd drops of woe, Through fearful omens, for her lover flow: Oh will he, far by faithless ocean borne, Dream of his lonely maid who lives to mourn? Will he, whene'er by palmy streams he roams, Muse on their twilight-walks and woodbine homes, And that first spring, when in the cowslip dale She blush'd an answer to his wooing tale? The beach is won; before her moans a sea, In all its dim and dread immensity! Wide o'er the wave a wistful glance she throws, Till the fond lover smiles away her woes; Voiceless awhile he clasps his dark-eyed maid, Then looks the promise love has often said; But, ere his vessel, in the horizon's blue Veil'd by the mist, hath vanish'd from her view, Sweet mourner! heavenward hope uplifts her mind To Him who wings the storm, and walks the wind. Thrice has the sun upon his green-wave bed, 'Mid rosy clouds, his vesper radiance shed; And thrice the moon from out the ocean rose, Like pale-eyed beauty waking from repose; While rock'd beneath, the melancholy wave Sang like a mermaid o'er the scaman's grave. The morn is up: and in her mellow ray Millions of youthful billows pant and play; Greeting the stately vessels as they glide In sail-wing'd triumph o'er the breezy tide. But, lo! around the marsh'lling clouds unite, Like thick battalions halting for the fight; The sun retires, and rending whirlwinds sweep Fierce through the air, and flutter on the deep; Forth from their caverns rush the fatal blasts, Tear the loose sails, and split the creaking masts, And the lash'd billows, rolling in a train, Rear their white heads, and race along the main. And, see! hurl'd backward from a hidden rock, A shatter'd vessel reeling with the shock, Like one appall'd by an unearthly sight, Who stands, and shivers with convulsive fright: There, in a den of waves, she heaves awhile, Till on her deck the howling surges pile; Then struggling sinks beneath the water's leap, Like a huge monster wrestling with the deep. Borne like a sunbeam on the bounding waves, Behold! a mariner the tempest braves; Home, life, and love, and near-imagin'd death, Nerve the stout limb, and lengthen out his breath: A rock is reach'd, dash'd on a wave-worn peak Lies the wreck'd sailor, shiv'ring, wan, and weak; With livid face, and looks of ghastly dread, And locks, like sea-weeds streaming from his head; Unmoved the lips, but with his upturn'd eyes, He shadows forth a Saviour in the skies; Visions a viewless temple in the air, Feels God around, and silence is his prayer! Can Guilt, though hidden from the gaze of earth, Fly from His view, who gave all being birth? From her first shadow on the yielding soul, To the dark hour when all her terrors roll, His sleepless eye detects each buried plan, And bares the bosom-secret of the man. Yes! oft He locks the weapon in his hand, And makes the murd'rer for his capture stand; Or, when the flood of years has roll'd away The darksome horrors of the blood-curs'd day,— His vengeance frowns upon the felon's sleep, Forcing his haggard eye to wake, and weep! Upon the midnight-heath, where fierce winds growl, Like famish'd wolves careering as they howl, While cloudy billows darkly swell and rise As if an ocean brooded in the skies, Aghast and quaking, see the murd'rer stand, Shrink from himself, and clench his crimson hand; Unearthly terrors freeze his shudd'ring frame, While conscience writhes upon the rack of shame: Beneath him gasps the victim of his deed, In that faint struggle ere the spirit's freed; One piteous gaze—his languid eyelids close, And life and torture sink to dead repose. Why stands the murd'rer fetter'd to the spot, Life, fame, and judgment in his guilt forgot? Chain'd by his crime, he cannot—dare not fly, A Spirit seems to grasp him from the sky! And though no human eye the murder sees, A curse from heaven comes mutter'd in each breeze. Though Crime entomb herself within the heart, And veil her anguish with dissembling art; Though 'mid the glare of day, and dazzling strife That flashes o'er the shadowy stream of life, She move as merry as the morning air, Unmarr'd by grief, unsorrow'd by a care,— Darkness shall bear the burden of her sin, And fan the hell of thought that flames within! At deep dead night, when not an earthly sound Jars on the brooding air that sleeps around; When the coarse raptures of a Christless day, Touch'd by the wand of Truth, dissolve away, Unhallow'd Guilt shall in her bosom feel A rack too fierce for language to reveal; A sense unutt'rable within the soul Of Him pervading—living through the whole: On ev'ry limb shall creeping terror come, Lock the white lips, and strike cold anguish dumb; Vengeance shall utter an imagin'd yell, And Fancy flutter round the gulph of Hell. Not so comes darkness to the good man's breast, When Night brings on the lulling hour of rest; Tired of the day, a pillow laps his head, While heavenly vigils watch around the bed; His spirit bosom'd on the God of all,— Peace to the hour! whate'er the night befal: Then, pleasing Memory unrolls her chart, To raise, refine, and regulate the heart; Exulting Boyhood, and its host of smiles, Next, busy Manhood battling with its toils, Delights and dreams that made the heart run o'er, The love forgotten, and the friends no more— The panorama of past life appears, Warms his pure mind, and melts it into tears! Till, like a shutting flower, the senses close, And on him lies the beauty of repose. Yes! in the dark, Imagination seems Girt with a shadowy brood of awful Dreams, Which round her in appalling visions fly, Dread as the phantoms on a thunder-sky; And Guilt starts back, by gloomy horror driven, But Virtue braves them with a smile from Heaven. 'Tis night: and sternly comes the mutt'ring wind, While cloud-battalions slowly march behind; Alone the way-worn pilgrim winds his track, His wallet resting on his weary back; Though dark the path, and dreary grows the night, And not a heaven-lamp yields its holy light, Firm o'er the starless wild he moves his way, For HE pervades the night, who form'd the day! Thus on he roams beneath the brooding sky, Till, lo, a lattice twinkles on his eye, And merrily from out his woodland dome, His babes bound forth, and hail the wand'rer home. When Conscience darts her stings into the mind, And heart-broke Folly turns to look behind, Then, righteous Heaven, without Thy hopeful ray, What fell despair would lower on our way! Where shall we light the burden of our woes? How should we lull our anguish to repose?— But, when the rebel Heart has ceas'd to roam, And yearns o'er visions of forsaken home, Thy love will hail the chasten'd wand'rer there, And hush to peace the tempest of despair. And not more beautiful beneath the ray Of risen morn, night-shades dissolve away, And the unmantled world, embathed in light, Awakes in orient glory, clear and bright,— Than do the sinful mists that shroud the soul Melt off beneath religion's mild control, Till the full impress of our God appears, Made pure and perfect by repentant tears. Now, day by day, celestial feelings rise Fresh from the heart, and reach th' immortal skies: Now comes the hour, when rambling all unseen, Except by stars, upon the dusky green; When winds are voiceless, and the breezes still, Save truant ones, which rove some wooded hill, Eternal glories dawn upon the heart, Till tears ecstatic from the soul-fount start; And sorrow, bursting from ideal gloom, Soars after Christ, and triumphs o'er the tomb. But when the erring heart at Passion's shrine Hath basely sacrificed each trait divine: When Guilt hath stain'd it with her deepest dye, And blood for blood is Nature's dreadful cry, Angel of Mercy! thy becalming power Alone can tame the terrors of the hour; Thine is the charm that bids the heart unbind, Mount on the wings of Faith, and leave Despair behind; Thine is the voice that soothes the dying breath, And breathes a halo round the brow of Death. And hark! the midnight bars have ceas'd to sound, The dungeon guard has paced his clanking round, And all is lone, and dismal as the deep When weary Storms sink mutt'ring into sleep; But one there is, in yonder glimm'ring cell, Whose young heart wept, and wonder'd while it fell; A wreck of crime upon his stony bed, With eye wild-rolling and bewilder'd head. 'Tis not the chain that clinks upon his straw, 'Tis not the blow of violated law,— But racking thoughts which rive his shudd'ring heart, And make each fibre of the bosom start. Yes! they have borne him to his native streams, Where young-eyed Fancy wove her fairy dreams; To each wild glade where Boyhood loved to roam, Till twilight came, and call'd the truant home: And where is she who rock'd him to repose, And sang, and smiled, to lull his infant woes? And he who greeted with paternal joy The dawning virtues of his darling boy? Afar, beneath the trampled sod they sleep, He neither heard them sigh, nor saw them weep!— That wasted eye and palpitating cheek, Those wringing hands, and that delirious shriek, Oh, these betray the burning load of pain Remembrance piles upon his phrensied brain: Till Faith descend upon her wings of Love, And show the Mercy-seat unveil'd above; Then, firm his glance, hush'd every groan and cry, And hypocrites might shake to view a felon die! 'Tis sad to see the eye forget its ray, And sorrow sit where smiles were wont to play; 'Tis sad, when youth is fresh, and fair, and warm, And life is fraught with every sweeter charm, To see it close the lip, and droop the head, Wane from this earth, and mingle with the dead; But, oh! nor death, nor wo, can ever seem So heart-appalling as that wild'ring dream. That life in death—a desolated Mind, Around whose wreck the weeds of madness wind. Down yon romantic dale, where hamlets few Arrest the summer pilgrim's frequent view, The village wonder, and the widow's joy, Dwells the poor, mindless, pale-faced maniac boy: He lives, and breathes, and rolls his vacant eye To greet the glowing fancies of the Sky; But on his cheek unmeaning shades of wo Reveal the wither'd thoughts that sleep below.— A soulless Thing, a haunter of the woods, He holds wild fellowship with fields and floods; Sometimes along the woodland's winding glade, He starts, and smiles upon his pallid shade; Or scolds with idiot threat the roaming wind,— But rebel music to that ruin'd mind! Or on the shell-strewn beach delighted strays, Playing his fingers in the noontide-rays; And when the sea-waves swell their hollow roar, He counts the billows plunging to the shore; And oft, beneath the glimmer of the moon, He chaunts some wild and melancholy tune, Till o'er his soft'ning features seems to play A flick'ring gleam of mind's recover'd sway. Thus, like a living Dream, apart from men, From morn to eve he haunts the wood and glen; But round him, near him, wheresoe'er he rove, A shielding Angel tracks him from above; Nor harm from flood or fen shall e'er destroy The lonesome wand'rings of that maniac boy. But lo, in pale sublimity of forms The arctic billows glare like frozen storms! For thus, in terrible array, are seen Mountains of ice where never man hath been, Where not a sound, nor motion dares advance To violate their everlasting trance; Save when the riven glaciers downward crush Themselves to water, with chaotic rush; Or Silence trembles, like a thing aghast, When o'er her waste the wolfish echo pass'd;— E'en here beneath the wings Almighty roam The brave sea-warriors from their English home, And find amid such wilderness of waves An Eye that watches, and a Hand that saves. Behold! yon Vessel with heroic prow Through a white realm of ice advancing now, Her cables stiffen'd into chains of frost, And the proud bearing of her beauty lost,— The prey of ocean, will she not descend, Tomb'd in dead ice, with none to mark her end? No! faith and valour, and inviolate hope, With danger in its deepest midnight cope; And Home shall listen yet, with pausing breath, To tales of ruin—the romance of Death, When frowning o'er her, like a Fiend he stood, And mutter'd, “Sink in ghastly solitude! And may the corpses of thy crew be seen To freeze and whiten where thy sails have been!” Victors of Nature in her dreadest might! Dauntless as winds that roam with free delight, When once again the rocks of England rise In tow'ring welcome on your dazzled eyes, As round the hearth young household-voices ring, Like the glad melodies of jocund spring, What records with your laden hearts unroll? Where is the painter, on whose gorgeous soul Visions of undepicted beauty rose, Like them that glitter'd on irradiant snows? Bright as the Palace John of Patmos view'd, What ice-domes flash'd in frozen solitude! What rocks of ruby glare, when sunset came Full on their whiteness, like a wingèd flame! And while the crimson of declining day Lit the cold fretwork of the crystal spray, How oft a seaman with ecstatic eyes Drank the rich magic of celestial dyes, Blent like a rainbow's, when the waters heave And tremble, while the braided colours weave.— But there was beauty that outdazzled this, Making the air one fairy-clime of bliss, When moonlight flung a robe of silver haze Athwart the mountains that received its rays, Till the stain'd welkin by reflection shone, Like floating emerald, or a verdant sun, So brightly green, so exquisite the glow!— And then, what meteors did pale twilight throw O'er the chill air, in wild electric play! Sublimely fierce, or delicately gay, The Borealis like a creature spread Its length of living glory o'er their head, And seem'd exulting with victorious light, To mock the darkness with its radiant might. But, oh, the silence!—dream-like, cold, and vast, As though the day of awful doom had pass'd, And Earth remain'd to wither, dead and lone, A blighted rebel, by her God unknown! So mute and soundless must that hour have been, When, gazing round on nature's ghastly scene Of crag and ice interminably piled, A frozen chaos, a sepulchral wild,— The seaman ponder'd till a thought of death Check'd the cold murmur of his faintest breath: Nature and God alone were reigning now: And the high meaning of his dauntless brow Dethroned by awe, dissolved and waned away, For Silence, like a spirit, seem'd to pray, Till the blood listen'd in his breathless frame, And, small and still, the voice Almighty came! Exhaustless Mercy! like that pilgrim brook, That never once the marching hosts forsook, When through the scorching wastes of Egypt's land, The cloud-led Israel steer'd by God's command, Thy stream, along the herbless path of life, Makes verdure smile, with bloom celestial rife: But if there be, round whom with holier might Dwells the deep sense of Heaven's o'erwatching light, Soldiers of Christ! whose banner faith unrolls, The true schechinah of protected souls 'Tis theirs to witness, when through clime and zone Where the grim idol mounts Jehovah's throne, And Man, degraded as the trampled clod, Bleeds at the shrine of some barbaric god, Wild as the torrent in its desperate fall, Whom blood, nor death, nor agonies appal, With spirit blighted, and with reason blind,— Who can rebuild his desolated mind? “Go forth and teach”—and ye have gone, and done Deeds that will shine, when thou art dark, O Sun! Heroes, whose crowns with gems of glory shine, Dug from the depths of heaven's eternal mine, Oh, what a conquest hath the Cross obtain'd! E'en where of old a hell of darkness reign'd, And Crime and Havoc, fiend-begotten pair, In mortal bosoms made their savage lair, And issued thence to riot, rage, or kill, Like incarnations of a demon's will, The peace that passeth understanding grows, And Earth seems born again, without her woes; So wondrously the spell divine descends, And man with nature in communion blends: The isles have seen HIM! and the deserts raise Anthems that thrill the halls of heaven with praise; Crouching and tame the tiger Passions lie, Hush'd by the gaze of God's subduing eye: Temples and homes of sacred truth abound, Where Satan once with all his fiends was found: And, hark! at sunset while the shaded calm Of forest coolness floats on wings of balm, As roams the pilgrim in that dying glare, From a lone hamlet winds the voice of prayer,— Breath of the soul by Jesu taught to rise And blend with music heard beyond the skics! Ecstatic thought! the zenith of our dreams, Error has died in Truth's victorious beams: And where the savage round his altar fed On the warm fragments of the limbless dead, Cots which an English heart delights to hail Deck the green wilds of many a foreign dale, And, turn'd by Piety's familiar hand, Religion sees her tear-worn Bibles stand. “Thy kingdom come!” prophetic voices throng In choral harmony, and chant, “How long, How long, O beatific King of kings, Till ransom'd earth with gospel-music rings? How long a period ere that Sun arise Which glitter'd on Isaiah's holy eyes, And clad the cedar'd hills of Palestine With veils of glory, wove from sheen divine?” Oh for that day, beyond what poets dream, Deck'd by Imagination's crystal beam, When vanquish'd Sin shall leave Messiah's throne To rise in full transcendancy alone: Hate, War, and Tumult, all the brood of crime, Shall then be banish'd from the scene of time; Evil be dead, Corruption breathe no more, And Peace, the seraph, smile from shore to shore, While round her Prince sublime hosannahs swell,— “Thy truth has wither'd all the thrones of Hell! For ever and for ever live and reign, Till earth be purified to heaven again!” Thou unimagined God! though every hour, And every day speak Thy mysterious power; Upon the seventh, creation's work was crown'd: Upon the seventh, ten thousand worlds wheel'd round! And ever hallow'd be Thy chosen day, Till Nature die, and Time shall roll away. Sweet Sabbath morn! from childhood's dimpled prime I lov'd to hail thy calm-renewing time; Soft steal thy bells upon the trancèd mind, In fairy cadence floating on the wind, Telling of friends and times long flown away. And pensive hopes harmonious with the day. On thy still dawn, while holy music peals, And far around the ling'ring echo steals, What Heart communes not with the day's repose, And, lull'd by angel-dreams, forgets its woes? Who, in His temple, gives to God a prayer, Nor feels an image of bright heaven is there? The pleading stillness of the vaulted pile, Where gather'd hearts their homage breathe awhile, The mingled burst of penitential sighs, The choral anthem pealing to the skies, Exalt the soul to energies sublime, And thoughts that reach beyond the realm of time. Emblem of peace! upon the village plain Thou dawn'st a blessing to the toil-worn swain: Soon as thy smiles along the upland play, His bosom kindles to salute the day; Humble and happy, to his lot resign'd, He owns the inward sabbath of the mind. And when, with low-drawn sighs of love and fear, His suppliant vows have sought Jehovah's ear, Serene the thoughts which o'er his bosom steal, As home he wanders for the sabbath meal: There shall kind Plenty wear her sweetest smiles; There shall his ruddy children play their wiles; While the fond mother, lapp'd in worldless joy, Fondles with frequent kiss her infant boy. At noon, a ramble round the burial-ground, A moral tear on some lamented mound; Or breezy walk along the green expanse, Where endless verdure charms the ling'ring glance,— These are the wonted blessings of the day, Which all his weekly toils and woes repay. And when the shroud of night hath veil'd the view, And star-gleams twinkle on the meadow-dew, Some elder boy beside his father's knee Shall stand and read the Eternal History: Orhousehold-prayer, or chanted hymn shall close The hour that charms him to a sweet repose. And Melody,—an echo breathed from heaven! By her ineffable delight is given; Whether she melt a passion from the mind, Or with Æolian languish lull the wind; Whether she madden in the mingled roar Of Alpine billows bounding to the shore; Or on the elfin pinions of a breeze Float o'er the flowers, and woo the vernal trees,— Alike divine! But, deeper in the soul Sinks melody's omnipotent control. When from the fluted organ, full and deep Billows of music through the dim aisles sweep! Ear, eye, and heart, confess the awful spell, While soul and being with the magic swell, And as the spiral echoes upward wind, Die off—and scarcely leave the man behind. And now, while faintly-ebbing murmurs roll Entrancing music o'er the prostrate soul, Religion loves to linger in some aisle, Where through emblazon'd panes a vesper smile With pallid radiance quivers in the gloom, Or crowns, like seraph-light, th' inspiring tomb; The thrilling echoes of sepulchral ground, The monumental awe suffused around, The fretted arch with its gigantic sweep, The world's great Spirits throned in marble sleep,— Subdue each earthly passion into fear, As though the resurrection-hour drew near! But not alone the vast and vaulted pile, An echoing cloister, or the pillar'd aisle, Hallow the mind: for humblest fanes impart A holy magic to the feeling heart. And see, down where yon arches shed their gloom, And mottoes speak from many a time-worn tomb, There, where the Font uprears its marble brow, The village sponsors breathe their sacred vow, While timidly a mother, young and mild, To Heaven presents her dedicated child: And oft she gazes on the sleeping boy, Lock'd to her breast with all a mother's joy; Fearful and fond, and twining for repose, Like a young bud around the parent rose. But who shall paint her meditative eye, Her look of love and heaven-appealing sigh, When on the cherub brow, with hope divine, The holy preacher prints the liquid sign? Joy, doubt, and fear in mingled passion rise, Gush through her heart, and glitter in her eyes. Whene'er I gaze upon a sinless child, Tossing its merry head of ringlets wild, Lip, cheek, and eye, all in that lovely glow Young spirits feel, as yet unchill'd by wo, A voiceless wonder animates each sense, To think how Mercy watches innocence! Survey the scene of life: in yonder room, Pillow'd in beauty 'mid the cradle gloom, While o'er its features plays an angel-smile, A breathing cherub slumbers for a while: Those budding lips, the faintly-fringèd eye, That placid cheek, and uncomplaining sigh, The rounded limbs in soft embrace entwined, Like flower-leaves folded from the sev'ring wind,— All by their tender charms her babe endear, And feed the lux'ry of a mother's fear. Next, mark her infant raised to childhood's stage, Bound in the bloom of that delightful age, With heart as light as wavelets on the deep, And eye that Wo has scarcely taught to weep:— The tip-toe gaze, the pertinacious ken, Each rival attribute of mimick'd men, The prompt decision, and presuming way, Now picture forth his yet auspicious day. Whether at noon he waft his tiny boat By winding streams, and woody bank remote, Or climb the meadow-tree, or trail the kite, And thinks that heaven ne'er match'd that moving sight! Or roam the haunted wood at dying day, To list with spell-bound ear the cuckoo's lay,— A Hand above o'er-rules the vent'rous boy, And draws the daily circle of his joy. And thus, when manhood brings its weight of care, To chain the soul, and curb the giddy air, The father, friend, the patriot, and the man, Share in the love of Heaven's parental plan; Till age o'ersteal his mellow'd form at last, And wintry locks tell summer youth is past; Then, like the sun slow-wheeling to the wave, He sinks in glory to a welcome grave. Lord of the Universe! enthron'd sublime In secret glory over Space and Time, Though oft the red-wing'd lightnings sear the sky, And mutt'ring thunders mark Thy track on high, One omnipresent, ever sleepless Love Pervades what issues from Thy power above: When from Thy hands primeval earth outsprang, And starry music o'er the launch'd world rang, Thine emblem, God, was Love! nor eye can see Where love is not the master-trait of Thee. And since that time, when first in Eden's bower The stainless Adam bent to beauty's power, Have Souls commingled in affection's flame, In weal unsever'd, and in wo the same. Young, chaste, and lovely—pleased, yet half afraid, Before yon altar droops a plighted maid, Clad in her bridal robes of taintless white, Dumb with the scene, and dazzled with delight. Around her hymeneal guardians stand, Each with devoted look, and feeling bland; And oft she turns her soul-expressing eye, Dimm'd with a tear for happiness gone by! Then coyly views, in youth's commanding pride, Her own betroth'd one kneeling by her side: Like lilies bending from the noon-tide blaze, Her bashful eyelids droop beneath his gaze; While love and homage blend their blissful power, And shed a halo round his marriage-hour. What though this chance-abounding life ordain A path of anguish and corrective pain; By want or wo, where'er compell'd he rove, A cot's a palace by the light of love! There beats one heart, which until death will be A fountain-source of fondest sympathy; One frownless eye to kindle with his own, One changeless friend, when other friends are flown: Oh, sanction Thou the love-united pair, Author of love! for Thou art present there. There be some heart-entwining hours of life, With uncontrollable sensation rife; When mellow'd thoughts, like music on the ear, Thrill through the soul, and revel in a tear. And, such are they, when, tranquil and alone We sit and ponder on long periods flown; And, charm'd by Fancy's retrospective gaze, Live in an atmosphere of other days; Till friends and faces, flashing on the mind, Conceal the havoc time has left behind. Yon aged man,—with what a musing eye He dreams and lingers o'er the days fled by, When pensive, sitting by his evening-fire, To Mem'ry's peaceful glade his thoughts retire, While cherub grandsons pat his willing knee, Shake their bright curls, and prattle off their glee. Now gently fleet back joy-wing'd days of old, When Hope led forward, and the eye look'd bold: With holy calm he thinks of place and time, Beloved when left, unblotted with a crime; Cold friendship's smiles are re-illumined now, And gleams of fancy lighten on his brow! What Hand puissant gave to life each form, Scatter'd the cloud and piloted the storm? Guided him onward through his thorny road, Bestow'd each joy, and brighten'd each abode? Ah! see the pious tear of mem'ry roll In welling rapture from his grateful soul, That trembles like the waking pulse of joy, To feel, Heaven raised the man, and rear'd the boy! Chain'd to the car of Time, as on we roll Through cloud and sunshine to th' Eternal goal, How favour'd he, whose soul, through Grace refined, Meets by the way some all-partaking mind, Some feeling friend, by Nature mark'd our own, And moulded true to every tender tone! Let fortune frown, congenial scenes depart, And “farewell” rive the fetters of the heart,— 'Tis sweet, when roaming by a wave-girt strand, To weave fond visions of our own far Land; Or dream, while faintly chimes the convent-bell, Of distant friends, and each domestic spell, And feel one Spirit tracks our lone career And dwells in every heart to Friendship dear. And if brief absence in our chequer'd life Wake in fond bosoms sympathetic strife, How deep the wo when death's terrific hand Tears a loved victim to a shadowy land!— Oh Death! thou dreadless Vanquisher of earth, The elements shrunk blasted at thy birth; Thine is the conquest of untold mankind, Victims before, and carnage strewn behind! And say, when thoughtful on our couch we lie, And scan the future with uncheated eye, How fancy dreads to realise the tomb, Shrinks into awe, and shudders at its doom; What shapes of horror glide around our bed, Damp from the ghastly regions of the dead, While nature hovers o'er that fearful brink, Where Faith turns wild, and Thought too weak to think; Trembling and startling, like a shade in sleep, Or a lone vessel on the surging deep,— Till Revelation's heaven-directed beam Melts every doubt in some celestial dream; Oh, then no more convulsing terrors roll; Then, then, the hallelujah of the soul! Wing'd on the hope of heaven, it speeds away To the bright source of beatific Day. Lo! on a shaded couch, with pillow'd head, And pallid limbs in dewy languor spread, The dying parent, like a wailing breeze, Moans in the feverish grasp of wan Disease; While sad and watching, with a sleepless eye, A lovely daughter sits and muses by: So Gabriel sat within the Saviour's tomb, When his pure spirit walk'd th' Eternal gloom. There, as some ancient abbey's muffled bell Tolls o'er the drowsing world the day's farewell, Frequent she glances at his wrinkled brow, And those dear eyes, so dim and deathful now, Till all his love and all his care returns, And memory through her brain and bosom burns!— That drooping hand, so delicately weak, How often had it smooth'd her infant cheek; Or danced her, lightly tripping by his side, And prattling sweetly with delighted pride; Or pluck'd the baby flower that charm'd her age, Or gently oped Instruction's pictured page, Or pointed to some mild and mournful star, That throned its beauty in the sky afar. And see, no more the arrowy throes of pain Pierce his bound head, or force the plaintive strain; Slumber hath heal'd them with its holy balm, And chain'd the senses in oblivion's calm; Pleased at his quiet mien, with timid breath, She stirs to see—alas! the sleep of Death; Pulseless and pale, beneath the taper's glow, Lies her loved parent, but a lifeless show! She shook not, shrick'd not, raised no maniac cry, Nor wrung her hand, nor heaved one heart-deep sigh; But stood aghast, too awful for relief, Mute, stiff, and white,—a monument of grief! To hear a dying lip's last accent speak, And watch the death-chill on a sunken cheek; Or see the flaming eye-ball fiercely roll, As if it wrestled with a parting soul; Or, hear the last clod crumble on the bed, And thrill some hollow mansion of the dead, This, this is wo!—but deeper far the gloom That haunts us, when we pace the desert room, And shadow forth an image of our love, Rapt to Elysian realms of light above; 'Tis now, while low and long the heavy knell Pours on the breeze a parted soul's farewell, Despair and anguish curtain round our view, And all but sorrow seems to be untrue. How sadly vacant turns the frequent gaze, To where a mourn'd one smiled in other days! The eye that glitter'd with each gen'rous thought; The glowing mind with worth and wisdom fraught; The twilight walk by some romantic stream, Where Friendship warm'd, while Fancy wove her dream; The smile, and wit,—all, all the feeling heart Delights to trace on mem'ry's faithful chart Return upon us; Omnipresent Power! 'Tis Thine to lull this agonising hour; To charm the burden from the soul, and be A Saviour-God in more than sympathy. PART III. “In the wild mystery of earth and air, Sun, moon, and star, and the unslumb'ring sea,— There is a meaning and a power, commix'd For thought, and for undying fancy tuned. And by thy panting for the unattain'd On earth; by longings which no language speak: By the dread torture of o'ermast'ring doubt; By thirst for Beauty, such as eye ne'er saw, And yet is ever mirror'd on the mind; By Love in her rich heavenliness array'd; By Guilt and Conscience,—that terrific pair, Who make the dead to mutter from their tombs, And colour nature with the hues of hell!— By Revelation's everlasting truths,—O Man, Thou art immortal as thy Maker is!” ANALYSIS OF PART III. If there be no God, the former parts of this Poem are moulded from dreams of superstitious fiction;— But can we observe the wonders of Creation, and deem Chance their origin?—The consequences that accrue from this distempered doctrine:—By a natural, but melancholy digression, we are here led to glance at Atheism—as partially influencing the horrors of the French Revolution—Marie Antoinette—Her appearance on the balcony during the tumults at Versailles. Return to a consideration of Atheism—It is a sorry boast to triumph over a belief of man's immortality —If the soul be not immortal, how are we to account for those aspirations which are never satisfied with the highest attainment of earthly enjoyment? The dismal doctrine of believing all ties of love eternally severed by death:—when we reflect on the master-spirits of gone time, can we imagine them eternally quenched?—Consolations derived from a belief in a future state—Pictures of a deathbed of a Sceptic and a Christian — The Poem concludes with a description of the final Doom. Now, while the stars in meekest beauty rise, And gaze on earth, like Heaven's maternal eyes, Oh, let sublime Imagination soar, And tread the region Milton trod before, Ride on the deep, or travel with the sun Far as creation smiles, or time has run, So shall her eagle eye divinely see A universe that glows with Deity,— In every wave and wind, and fruit and flower, The glory, truth, and terror of His power. Who hung yon planet in its airy shrine, And dash'd the sunbeam from its burning mine? Who bade the ocean-mountains swell and leap, And thunder rattle from the skyey deep? Through hill and dale who twined the healthful stream, Made rain for nurture, and the fruit to teem? Who charm'd the clod into a breathing shrine, And call'd it Man, a miniature divine?— Lord of Creation, Love, and Life, and Light, Arise, and vindicate Thine awful right! And dare men dream that dismal Chance has framed All that the eye perceives, or tongue has named, The spacious world, and all its wonders, born Designless, self-created, and forlorn? That no First Builder plied His plastic force, Gave to each object form, to motion course? Then may Religion, Morals, Truth, and Worth, Perish from out this atheistic earth! Why should the orphans of the world who roam O'er earth's bleak waste, without a friend, a home, With resignation mark their fellow clay Bask in the sunshine of a better day? Why should the vagrant shiver at the door, Nor crush the miser for his treasured ore, Save Faith's sweet music harmonised the mind, Whisper'd of Heaven, and bade it be resign'd? And here let Mem'ry turn her tearful glance On the grim horrors of tumultuous France; When blood and blasphemy defiled her land, And fierce Rebellion raised her savage hand, While women flung their female hearts away, Rear'd the red pike, and butcher'd for their pay. No more the Tocsin for the carnage tolls, No dead-piled tumbril from the slaughter rolls; The blood has dried upon each wither'd plain, And brave La Vendée blooms in peace again; Still may we paint an image of the times, And draw a moral from a Nation's crimes. Ill-fated Land! did godless wisdom pour The light of liberty from shore to shore? Ah no, perverted freedom cursed the day With nameless deeds of horror and dismay; Virtue was death-struck, Vice alone had power, And Fiends saw hell on earth, in that black hour! Let streets of blood, let dungeons choked with dead, The tortured brave, the royal Hearts who bled; Let plunder'd cities, and polluted fanes, The butcher'd thousands piled upon the plains, Let the foul orgies of stupendous crime Witness the raging havoc of that time, When leagued Rebellion march'd to kindle Man, Fright in her rear, and Murder at her van. And thou, sweet flower of Austria! slaughter'd queen, How oft will Hist'ry in thy dreadful scene Sigh to relate, what once a woman saw, Whose very look had been a nation's law; When all high chivalries of heart were fled, And Treason's dagger pierced the monarch's bed. But thou wast fearless 'mid the savage yell When Murder hooted, as the hatchet fell. Queen to the last! methinks I see thee stand, With infants clasping thy maternal hand, And face unmoved the murd'rous throng who came A deed to do which Earth might shrink to name. Unmann'd of men! whose thankless eyes can glance On all around, and deem it born of Chance; Self-martyr'd victims to appalling doom, Your life a vision, and your heart a tomb,— The source and end of Being in the ground, Where all is silent, and your goal is found! How charmless time must stream away with you, To struggle, wish, and weep, and then—Adieu! Ye cannot stifle Sorrow at her birth, By hopes prevailing o'er the woes of earth, Nor soothe the passions which besiege the soul By immortality's divine control, Share with the majesty of earth and sky, Mount on a thought, and talk with Deity! Boast not of wisdom, if her precepts say Th' Immortal Essence mingles with the clay; In polar isles, where wisdom's mellow beam Ne'er chasten'd beauty's glance, or rapture's dream, E'en there a Deity pervades the mind, Speaks in the storm, and travels on the wind. And shall the Soul, the fount of reason, die, When dust and darkness round its temple lie? Did God breathe in it no ethereal fire, Burning and quenchless, though the breath expire? Then, why were godlike aspirations given, That, scorning earth, so often frame a heaven? Why does the ever-craving wish arise For better, nobler, than the world supplies? Ah, no! it cannot be that men were sent To moulder in ethereal discontent, That soul was fashion'd for betrayful trust, To think like God, and perish like the dust! If Death for ever doom us to the clod, And earth-born pleasure be our only god, Remorseless time shall bury all we love, Nor leave one hope to reunite above; No more the voice of friendship shall beguile, No more the mother on her infant smile, But vanishing, like rain upon the deep, Nature is,—Nothing, in eternal sleep! Monarchs of mind! and spirits of the just, Are ye entomb'd in everlasting dust? Shall ye, whose names undimm'd by ages shine, Bright as the flame that mark'd ye for divine, For ever slumber,—never meet again, Too pure for sorrow, too sublime for pain? Ah, no! celestial Fancy loves to fly With eager pinion, and prophetic eye, To radiant dwellings of immortal Bliss, Far from a world so wo-begone as this; There, as the choral melodies carcer, And wind and warble through heaven's mystic sphere, In perfect forms you all again unite, And worship Godhead on His throne of Light. When friends have vanish'd to the spirit-home, And we are left companionless to roam, Oh, what can cheer our melancholy way, But hopes of union in the land of Day? Soul-loved! companions of our greener years, Warm'd at our joys, and weeping at our tears, How oft descriptive mem'ry paints each hour, When friendship triumph'd, and the heart had power! Yes, hallow'd are those visions of the brain, When Heaven unveils, and lov'd ones smile again. And Thou, for ever fond, for ever true, Beneath whose smile the boy to manhood grew; To sorrow piteous, and to error mild, Has Death for ever torn thee from thy child? Thy voice that counsell'd, charm'd, consol'd, and bless'd, Thy deep solicitude which found no rest But in completion of some pure design, To make my happiness the spring of thine; Thy boundless love, whose providential gaze Pour'd light and tenderness round all my ways; Those myriad fascinations felt and known Of truth maternal to be borne alone. (Too coldly prized while we can call them ours, And feel them gladden the unduteous hours, But, oh! how worshipp'd, magically dear, When woke to life by mem'ry's votive tear!) Though these have perish'd, Love in deathless bloom Outlives the torpor of the wintry tomb. There is a clime where sorrow never came, There is a peace perennially the same; There rolls a world where sever'd Hearts renew Bright sympathies, the exquisite and true! But chasten'd, calm, exalted, and refined To each pure tone of beatific mind. There may we meet, departed Spirit! there, The home of bliss, the paradise of prayer: A few more pangs, a few more tears to shed, And I shall mingle with the faded dead; A few fleet years, and this tried heart must brave The damp oblivion of the dreamless grave; When, true as thine, may resignation close These eyes for glory in their last repose. And if the Dead on this dull world may gaze To breathe a blessing round our guarded ways; If by some ministry, to man unknown, They still can make a human wish their own, And wander round, ineffably serene, That unforgotten home, where life has been,— Spirit maternal! often gaze on me, And soothe the pang that so remembers thee! Hover around me when I mourn, or pray, Cheer the lone night, and consecrate the day: When temper kindles, or when passion dares, Renew thy warning, and recall thy cares,— Bid thy past love like inspiration rise, And plead for Virtue with a mother's sighs! But say! how will the sceptic brave the hour Of crushing death's inexorable power, When all this gorgeous world shall glide away, Like painted dreams before the breath of day? See, how he shudders at a glance of death; What doubt and horror hang upon his breath; The gibb'ring teeth, glazed eye, and marble limb,— Shades from the tomb stalk out, and stare on him! Lo, there, in yonder spectre-haunted room, What mutter'd curses trembled through the gloom, When pale and shiv'ring, and bedew'd with fear, The dying sceptic felt his hour draw near! As the last throes of death convuls'd his cheek, He gnash'd, and scowl'd, and raised a hideous shriek, Rounded his eyes into a ghastly glare, Lock'd his white lips—and all was mute despair. Go, child of Darkness! see a christian die; No horror pales his lip, or dims his eye; No fiend-shaped phantoms of destruction start The hope religion pillows on his heart, When with a falt'ring hand he waves adieu, From Hearts as tender as their tears are true; Meek as an infant to the mother's breast Turns, fondly longing for its wonted rest, So to his God the yielding soul retires, And in one sigh of sainted peace expires. But what is death or danger, storm or sea, What are the loudest thunders launch'd by Thee, Thou dread Jehovah! to a blazing world,— Creation from its huge foundation hurl'd? Then, then will reign Thine unimagin'd power, And Earth in flames expect her funeral hour. Ages has awful Time been trav'lling on, And all hìs children to one tomb have gone; The varied wonders of the peopled earth, In equal turn, have gloried in their birth; We live and toil, we triumph and decay,— Thus age on age rolls unperceived away; And thus 'twill be, till Heaven's last thunders roar, And Man and Nature shall exist no more. Oh! say, what Fancy, though endow'd sublime, Can picture truly that sepulchral time, When the last sun shall blaze upon the sea, And Time be buried in eternity? A cloudy mantle will enwrap that Sun Whose face so many worlds have gazed upon; The placid Moon, beneath whose pensive beam We all have loved to wander, and to dream, Dyed into blood, shall glare from pole to pole, And tinge the gloomy tempests as they roll; And those sweet Stars, that like familiar eyes, Are wont to smile a welcome from the skies, No more shall fascinate our dreaming sight, But quench their beauty in perpetual night.— And, hark! how wildly on the ruin'd shore Expiring Ocean pants in hollow roar, While earth's abysses echo back the groan, And startle Nature on her secret throne! But ere creation's everlasting pall Unfold its darkness, and envelop all, The tombs shall burst, the cited dead arise, And gaze on Godhead with unblasted eyes. Hark! from the deep of heaven a trumpetsound Thunders the dizzy universe around; From north to south, from east to west it rolls A blast which summons all created souls; And swift as ripples form upon the deep The dead awaken from their dismal sleep! The Sea has heard it; coiling up with dread,— Myriads of mortals flash from out her bed, The graves fly open, and with awful strife The dust of Ages startles into life! All who have breathed, or moved, or seen, or felt; All they around whose cradles Kingdoms knelt; Tyrants and warriors, who were throned in blood; The great and mean, the glorious and the good, Are raised from every isle, and land, and tomb, To hear the changeless, and eternal doom! But, while the universe is wrapt in fire, Ere yet the splendid ruin shall expire, Beneath a canopy of flame behold, With shining banners at his feet unroll'd, Earth's Judge! round Whom seraphic minstrels throng, And chant o'er golden harps celestial song.— But, let the hush of holy silence now Brood o'er the heart, and more than words avow, While the huge fabric of the world gives way, And shrieking myriads to the mountains pray, “Descend upon us! Oh, conceal that sight, The Lamb encompass'd with consuming light!” Behold a burning Chaos hath begun, The moon is crimson'd, and how black the sun! While cloud-flames, welt'ring in confusion dire, Flash like a firmament of sea on fire; Yea, all the billows of the main have fled, And nought appears but ocean's waveless bed, Whose cavern'd bosom with tremendous gloom Yawns on the world like dead Creation's tomb! But lo! the breathing harvest of the earth Reap'd from their graves to share a second birth; Millions of eyes with one deep dreadful stare Gaze upward through the flaming scene of air, In pierced Immanuel their own Judge to see, And hear him sentence man's Eternity! Wing'd like bright angels, warbling hymns of love, The saints are soaring unto Christ above; Still as they mount increasing splendours play, And light the progress of their hallow'd way. Yet, hark! what horrid yells beneath him rise From perish'd Souls, who lift their guilty cries, And by the brink of sin's awarded Hell Shriek unto God and man their wild farewell! But here, let silence our religion be, And prayer become the Muse's poetry; Nor must the power of meditative song Grasp the high secrets which to God belong. Struck with due awe, let Fancy then retire, And faith divine the dreaming soul inspire, Under the shade of that almighty Throne From whose dread face the Universe hath flown! THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. TO THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. THE IDEA OF GOD. “In the beginning God.”—Gen. i. 1. Enthroned in vast eternity How awful, God! to muse on Thee, Voiceless and viewless, First and Last, The All in All, without a past! When thus to Thee our minds would mount, And trace pure Being to its fount, O'erawed they shrink abash'd and dim, Like glory-dazzled Cherubim. For, once Thou wast the dread Alone, No universe around Thee thrown, No choral worlds to chant Thy praise, No spirits basking in Thy blaze; But in Thyself, that sacred Three, Whose name is Love, and Mystery,— In trinal grandeur thus enshrined, Unheard, unfelt, and undivined. Thou didst not, then, the worlds create, Because Thy glories fail'd to be Whate'er of infinitely great Belongs to full-orb'd Deity: But, from Thine Essence freely came Creative power, and light, and love, And all which men or Angels name, Of bright below, or blest above. And hence yon worlds, with all they hold Of perfect, pure, serene, or grand, The purpose of Thy will unfold, And fill the hollow of Thy hand. From Thee our thoughts their grace derive, Chaste hearts receive celestial glow; And vainly would the sceptic strive Without Thee, e'en to think below. The mind which cannot God discern Grows day by day more weak, and vile, Must soon its very self unlearn,— Absorb'd in sin, and sunk in guile. Eternal Light! and Law of mind! If in Thy beams calm angels see A lustre that would strike them blind Were they to think they fathom'd Thee; Let insects like ourselves beware What majesties to Heaven belong!— Our science is believing prayer, And flesh is weak, when faith is strong. Most glorious God! while thus we scan Earth, air, and ocean through their bounds, And yearn to trace the measured plan Of Wisdom in her mystic rounds; Be ours the humbling thought, that all Of form and function, life or sense, Which men sublime and wondrous call,— Is nothing to Omnipotence! It was not once; it would not be, If Thy dread fiat said, Depart! For then, the universe would flee, And leave Thee, Godhead as Thou art. GOD CREATES. “God created.”—Gen. i. 1. There is religion in the common earth, A creed of beauty in the open sky; And shower and sunbeam prove a sacred birth, When fancy views them with a feeling eye. What men call Nature, is a Thought divine, The Infinite in forms of finite grace, Where all conditions, seen in God, combine To make this earth a consecrated place. Th' unwritten bible of the woods and fields By love perused, and ponder'd o'er by prayer, A second gospel to the poet yields, Who walks creation, knowing Christ is there. Nothing is mean, by Power celestial made, And nought is worthless, by His wisdom plann'd, Who fashion'd all, that Faith may find display'd The holy impress of God's master-hand. Oh, could we hail the Element divine That circles round whatever lives, or moves, A mystic radiance would o'er all things shine, And teach the coldest how the Godhead loves! One vast cathedral, with its roof of sky, The earth becomes to reverential souls, When deepen'd by such felt divinity, Our heart-breathed hymn of ceaseless worship rolls. But like a cloud doth sensual dimness hide The heaven-born glories that around us gleam, While min'string angels to and fro may glide, And yet not wake us from our worldly dream. Alas! for men, when thus creation grows An orphan'd scene, where God moves undiscern'd; While for the bliss His gracious hand bestows, Our thankless hearts, how seldom have they burn'd! This canker-worm of atheistic sin, Thrice Holy One! do Thou by grace destroy; Breathe o'er the deadness of the mind within, And brighten nature with religious joy. May the hush'd feeling, Thou art ever nigh, God in the creatures, Life and Law of all, Unveil pure Edens to our purgèd eye, And free the spirit from degrading thrall. Then will a spell of solemn beauty grace The humblest object which the senses scan, A temple rise in every cloister'd place, And all cry, “Worship!” to believing man. Mountain or forest, wood, or wild, or shore, Roam where we choose, whatever scene be trod, The reign of mindless solitude is o'er, For now, like Enoch, conscience walks with God. And, thus companion'd by His love and word, Each man as brother, faith delights to own; Peasant and prince, from each alike is heard “Our Father!” warbled to creation's Throne. Were but this creed by loving hearts enjoy'd, And God paternal by the soul embraced, How much of dark'ning self would be destroy'd, And beauty live, where now breathes moral waste! Our common life would seem a holy thing, The lone creation be with God allied, And not an hour but would some anthem sing, To praise the Fountain which our stream supplied. Around, above, beneath, 'tis all divine, When faith the grand Original can see, And, while Sense worships in the outer-shrine, Know the vast world was once a thought in Thee. Lord! may Thy Spirit to our spirit lend A princely heart of innocence and prayer, Whose unction shall the sacred feeling send, That proves, at every pulse, our God is there. Radiant his soul, though dark the sense-bound doom Terrestrial changes for its home supply, Who feels, before his dust descend the tomb, That all is christian to the christian eye. OUR DUTY IS OUR GLORY. “Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” 1 Cor. x. 31. Beauteous words! with glory burning, Guide and guardian of our days, Let us be for ever learning Wisdom from their wealth to raise: In them hides a heavenly power Which may hallow scene and hour, Touching all we hear, or see, With soft rays of Deity! He who call'd us into being, Each created for some plan; And, by prescience all foreseeing, So equipp'd the soul of man, That unless the sleepless Mind Love itself in all mankind, Whatsoe'er bright scenes present,— Dark life grows a discontent. Yet, apart from Revelation, Wisdom no true motive found, That with perfect inspiration Could for all alike abound: Pleasure, gain, or mental force, Palms which crown Ambition's course,— Sages found some lofty name, Thus to fix the final aim. But, where exists in heathen story Bard, or sage, who could descry Such a path for peaceful glory While we live, or when we die, As this text of heaven-breathed truth Here unfolds for age and youth,— “Whatsoe'er ye think, or do, Be your God the goal in view!” 'Twas Thine own celestial motive, Lord, when Thou on earth didst live; So, with spirit pure and votive Let us vow ourselves to give Back to Thee!—in woe or weal, Let our lives be one long zeal Never from Thy Church to roam, Faith's delight, and Feeling's home! None can reach a blissful centre Where the reas'ning mind can rest, Save by fellowship they enter On the pathway God hath blest: Great and glorious as may seem All which gilds an earth-born dream, Self can frame no heaven for sin, But it works a hell within! Blest is he who thus resigneth Soul and body unto Him, From Whose words whoe'er declineth, Martyr, saint, or seraphim, Must in darkness, death, and woe, Downward to perdition go, Reaping from self-will a curse, That would fire the universe. Sons of Heaven! be this your glory, Christ as motive so to feel, That life nor death shall set before ye What can daunt, or dim your zeal: Rich, or poor, or small, or great, Nought to you is outward state: God and grace within you dwell, And your mercies who can tell? Happy, happy is the feeling, Life belongs to Him who died, By atonement thus revealing Love incarnate, crucified. Duty, danger, toil, and time, Now are touch'd by truth sublime; All we have to faith appears, Sacred to His blood and tears. With such motive deeply glowing, Sin and self we learn to shun, So on heaven our hearts bestowing, That the angel seems begun; While more purely we can pray, And our creed of glory say, “Thou art worthy! Thou alone! Be our hearts Thy hallow'd throne!” Needs no rank, nor wealth, nor learning, When our sainted wills incline With a passion ever burning To pursue the path divine: Humble care and cottage-scene To the Lord's elect have been Little Edens, where they found Angels camping all around! Though thy station be but lowly, Christ is there, the soul to bless; Though thou seem'st forgotten wholly, Left to toil in loneliness, Eyes through heaven are peering down, In thy cross to see thy crown:— Let thy task in prayer be done, And thy glories are begun! Tell me not, in gloom and anguish, Lone and needy thou art left; Faith can ne'er for duty languish, Love and Hope are not bereft, If thy soul can truly say, At the close of each calm day, “Father! do Thy gracious will, Let my life Thy law fulfil!” Hast thou cheer'd the broken-hearted With a look of genial love? As the dying breath departed Didst thou point to worlds above? Hast thou sought the peasant's door, Soothed the sick, or cheer'd the poor, Lighted up the widow's eye, Or relieved an orphan's sigh? Fameless, then, though Earth deny thee Wealth and grandeur, power and place, More than worlds could e'er supply thee 'Tis to love the human race! Like some instrument of sound Changing with all airs around, Hearts of heaven can sympathise With whate'er a spirit tries. Read we then in hallow'd story With a swell of wordless joy, Duty forms divinest glory, When our lives for God employ Feeling, faculty, and power, Home and heart, and scene and hour, As one sacrifice of soul, Due to Him who gave the whole! THE FIRST MAN. “Let us make man.”—Gen. i. 26. Now, Heaven and Earth in finish'd beauty rise, And Ocean peals her new-born harmonies; And lo! awaking into life With stainless glory rich and rife, Under the breath of God's creative word, The realms of Being into bliss are stirr'd. Oh! to have gazed on glorious earth and sea, When, like the Infant of eternity, Our breathing World began to smile; Or, like some list'ning heart awhile, In mute suspension waited for a Soul To greet her glories, and command the whole. For, how could dumb magnificence display, Or this blank world as reasonless, portray The higher attributes of God, Till earth by human feet was trod; And young creation gain'd some priestly Mind To offer incense, pure as God design'd? But, hark! within the deeps of that Recess Where God enshrines His awful consciousness, Three Persons speak, Three Minds commune, A Council holds the dread Triune; And “Let Us make” him, symbols forth to man The outward meaning of Their inward Plan. And thus, obedient to that forming call, Emerges Man, the blissful lord of all; Soft lustres o'er his features play, And brow and bearing both display That regal air, God's image ought to show As priest and monarch of His world below. Hosannah! now ye choral planets sing; Poetic winds and waters, hail your king! Wake Sympathies! through earth and air Your genial motion everywhere; God's labours now their sabbath-haven reach, And silence echoes with the charm of speech. O happy vision! O celestial scene! What Heaven beheld, what sinless Earth hath been, When Paradise and perfect bliss Hallow'd a world sublime as this; Wing'd angels quiver'd over Eden's bowers, And Eve look'd fairer than the vestal flowers. Departed glory!—back to earth it seems At times recall'd, in those seraphic dreams When round us steals the witching sense Of man's unblotted innocence, And o'er the harp-strings of entrancèd soul Fragments of forfeit Eden's music roll. But, never let our joyless gloom repine, Blest Lord! as though there breathed not hopes divine, That earth may boast a nobler doom Than Paradise in perfect bloom; For Thou hast purchased, by atoning blood, A world transcending what was once the “good.” And may the Spirit of Thy grace descend, Our feelings hallow, and our hearts amend; Inspire us, O Creative Three, To image forth the Trinity, Till man shall witness more than Eden saw, His heart Thy temple, and Thy truth his law. MIND OF LITTLE CHILDREN. “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child.”—Matt. xviii. 1, 2. Men call it wisdom, when they grow Less and less like a child; But let the harsh and haughty know Such wisdom is defiled; The cold perfection of a cautious man, Who gains by cunning,—what the Serpent can! He, whose all-meas'ring Soul perceived The heights and depths of mind, A nobler creed would have believed When present with mankind, Who said, with Infancy beside His knee, “He that is greatest, like a child must be.” Heaven to a child comes nearer far Than in maturer age, When passion's brunt and blighting war Their ceaseless battle wage Against those young simplicities which dwell Deep in the bosom, like a guardian-spell. Oh! for a reverential eye To Childhood which pertains, That sees religion in the sky, And poetry in plains; To whom a rainbow like a rapture glows, And all is marvel which th' Almighty shows. Blest age of Wonder! when a flower, A blossom, fruit, or tree, Gives a new zest to each new hour Which gladdens home with glee: When like a lisping stream life rolls along In happy murmurs of unconscious song. It smiles on that, and speaks to this, As if each object knew A child exulted in the bliss Of all that charms its view: Personified the whole creation seems Into a heart that mirrors back its dreams. Life looks a fairy landscape spread Before the untaught gaze, As on the infant Soul is led To meet its vernal days, Where pure-eyed Innocence may well discern A deeper beauty than the wise can learn. Fresh from the hands of God they come These infants of His grace, And something of celestial home Yet lingers in their face; Strange to the world, no worldliness defiles The little history of their tears and smiles. Candid and curious, how they seek All truth to know and scan; And, ere the budding mind can speak, Begin to study Man! Confiding sweetness colours all they say, And Angels listen, when they try to pray. More playful than the birds of spring, Ingenuous, warm, sincere, Like meadow-bees upon the wing They roam without a fear; And breathe their thoughts on all who round them live, As Light sheds beams, or flowers their perfume give. And how the Church o'erawes their sense, With rite and ritual graced! Whose creed is loving innocence, Which time hath not effaced; And would that those, who Manhood's paths have trod, Like infants trembled at the name of God! Mysterious age! the type of heaven, By Jesu's blessing crown'd, To thee a purity is given Grey hairs have never found; The arms of Christ do yet encircle thee Like a soft halo which the Heart can see. Mere knowledge makes us keen and cold, And cunning dwarfs the mind, As more and more the heart grows old With feelings base and blind; Our light is clearer, but our love is less, And few the bosoms which our own can bless! Spirit of Grace! we learn from Thee This noble truth, at length,— That wisdom is simplicity, Simplicity is strength; A Child-man, could the world a model find, Would be a living type for human-kind. SOOTHING CHARM OF TIME. “No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness.”—Heb. xii. 11. When Time shall lay his lenient hand On this large grief of ours, The burden'd Heart will understand The mystery of past hours; But now, so thick a tear bedims the moisten'd eye That earth looks sever'd off from yonder loving sky. Mere fragment of a mighty Whole, How little man can see, While sin contracts the clouded soul, Of plans becoming Thee, Who didst by wisdom deep, from Thine all-boundless mind, In heaven forecast the lot for human souls design'd. To two eternities relate The pangs endured on earth; And all which marks our mortal fate In sickness, death, or birth, In awful depths of God before all time was plann'd, And carries with it more than sin can understand. Yet, when the cloud of woe hath burst Upon our hearts and homes, And Guilt appears by God accursed, The wistful Spirit roams From earth to heaven, in hope that some dear light will dart A ray of guiding truth, to cheer the chasten'd heart! Then, crowded o'er with sumless graves This blighted world appears; O'er each young joy the cypress waves, The eye seems made for tears; Calm mercies which remain in darkness now recede, And boding Fancy dreams, that Life was born to bleed! Unwise, unholy, and unjust We mourners then are found, Who, in bereavement, cannot trust Those Arms encircled round All sorrow, time, and change, whate'er the trial be, To girdle man with strength, if Faith those Arms would see. Afflictions should be sacred things; Some drops that overflow From that great Cup the Saviour brings Of anguish, grief, or woe, To each disciple here, who bears his Master's cross, And, when he calls him, “Lord!” doth count the gainful loss. How can the sainted child of God Resemble Christ, unless His upward path of life be trod Through shades of stern distress? The Lord of bleeding love, oh, lived He not alone, Unecho'd by a heart that understood his groan? And think, bereaved one! in that hour When ruin'd hopes lie cold, While death and darkness overpower Whate'er thine eyes behold, Of Him, who had not where to rest His gracious head, Weeping with stricken heart, when Love “forsook and fled!” Dejection now may cast A dimming veil round all Which brighten'd o'er thy youthful past; While underneath the pall That seems to overshroud whate'er we love below, Thy creedless heart detects no sight but death and woe.— Still, when the Dove of Peace divine Shall o'er thy spirit brood, And with His calm thy love combine, The soul will say, 'Twas “good;— Affliction with its flame hath purified the dross, And deeper in my soul enstamp'd a Saviour's cross.” And thus, the nerveless Mind will gain New force, and faith to meet Each rising swell of future pain, And lay it at His feet; As sunk the billows down along their placid sea, When Christ in calmness walk'd the waves of Galilee. Eternal Soother of the soul! True Paraclete for all Who yield to Thy serene control, On Thee for aid we call; Anguish, and gloom, and grave, can make the mourner sigh, But, ah, we shall not sink,—The Comforter is nigh! Perfect through suffering!—'tis the plan Mysterious Love decrees; And Christ, who was The sinless Man, From this found no release: His life was living prayer, with every pang combined, Where men and angels see a perfect Will resign'd. We seek not, Lord, a pangless life In homes and haunts of bliss; But, only that our mental strife May ne'er Thy presence miss:— Not starless is the night, when radiant truths arise, And point each promise forth that beacons to the skies! CHRIST THE GRAND REFUGE. “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.”—John vi. 68. “There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.”—Acts iv. 12. Lord, and whither shall we go? Thou alone hast words of life: In our stormful griefs below Who, but Thou, can heal the strife Sin and sorrow round us bring, In life's vale, while wandering? What can mortal Wisdom teach If o'er graves it cannot soar? How can rest the conscience reach If it leaves us as before? Guilty shades will haunt us yet, Making life one long regret! Poet! shall we come to thee, Harping forth some noble strain,— Songs of fire, which tell the free Never to be slaves again, Till they echo back thy word As by trumpet-music stirr'd? Son of Science! shall we soar Through yon starry worlds, to find Burning secrets which before Never glanced on human mind,— Orbs of myst'ry, as they roll Preaching God to sense and soul? Man of Learning! may we dare From thine oracle to draw Truths which tell us what we are, Or, that hush the dreadful Law, Thund'ring forth from earth and sea, “Render what thou ow'st to me?” Can you ease a burden'd soul From the crushing weight of sin, When it feels some fierce control Like a throbbing hell within? Can you cry to wearied Breast, “Hither! here is holy rest?” Have your words a healing skill, If applied with perfect art, To renew the rebel Will Till it take the better part, Bidding ev'ry wing'd desire Upward to the heavens aspire? God and man can ye unite In such bonds of sacred peace, That the blood-wash'd heart is white By Atonement's blest release? Can ye show a radiant Heaven Smiling o'er the soul forgiven? Foolish all false wisdom is, If to such attempts it rise; Would we claim a power like this?— Seek it, then, beyond the skies: Man at most can human be; What we want, is Deity! Blessed Christ! embodied Word! Thou alone art Life and Light; Saints who have Thy truth preferr'd Walk in peace, and worship right; Thou alone to sin canst say, “I am Love, the Living Way.” Sun of Grace! oh, ever shine Round our paths, where'er they lead; Midnight feels a ray divine Breaking through the darkest need, If we hear, when most dismay'd, “It is I! be not afraid!” Pardon, peace, and purity, Gifts without, and grace within, Love and light, which set us free From the curse and chain of sin,— These, Emanuel! Thou canst give, While upon Thy words we live. Not a want, Thou canst not fill; Not a fear, Thou wilt not tame; If, indeed, repentance will Rest upon Thy glorious name, High o'er every guilt and grave Shall Redemption's banner wave! Lord, then whither shall we go, Save to Thee, our Refuge sure? Balm to each bereaving woe,— Who alone the heart canst cure, Turning sickness into health, And, to want, becoming wealth. Well of Comfort! Vital Spring! Other source we dare not seek; Broken cisterns only bring Mocking draughts which make us weak: If our souls would slake their thirst, They must die, or seek Thee first! Saviour! be our Polar Star Shaded by no sinful night; Shed upon us from afar Living beams of holy light:— When we reach our radiant home, We shall know the way we come. POWER OF THE DEAD. “I praised the dead which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive.”—Eccles. iv. 2. “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from thenceforth ? They rest from their labours.” —Rev. xiv. 13. My thoughts are with the dear and dead, Who wake the inward sigh, And here an atmosphere have spread Breathed from the days gone by. Then do not mock the mental gloom That o'er my brow is stealing; For, could I walk this well-known room Without an ancient feeling? What genial hours of mirth and glee Have here those bright friends known, Who since to hush'd eternity Like living Dreams have flown! And think not that a stoic chill Is o'er my present cast; But, something more than mem'ry will Untomb the buried past. What, though these walls no longer now Present that houschold grace,— A pictured father's pensive brow, A mother's beaming face, Yet, I can almost hear them speak, And wake each cheerful tone, And catch the gladness of her cheek That lighted up my own. Oh, here has swell'd the choral song, And music's charm hath been, While mellow'd feelings moved along Like waves in moonlight seen. And kindly words of love and truth From lips now cold in death, Come wafted from the days of youth, Like resurrection-breath! So full the present fills the past With tenderness and tears, Time seems by some fond Angel cast Back into buried years. I think of her whose azure eyes Were motherly and mild, Clear as the morn's cerulean skies, In sweetness when they smiled: Gentle in tone, and graceful, too, In motion, mind, and mien, How warm the social ray she threw O'er each domestic scene! As mother, wife, and peerless friend, In all her ways appear'd A beauteous Soul, in whom did blend The graces love revered. And he whose world-wide fame is wed To History and to Man, Though number'd with th' immortal dead, How high a course he ran! I see him now, his fervid gaze Illumined keen with thought, And glow beneath the flashing rays From his bright wisdom caught. With heavenly truth historic lore His works have nobly blent, And Time, who keeps our mental store, Shall make his monument. Can I forget that hoary sage, The generous, pure, and good, Who counsell'd oft my unripe age As only Virtue could? And, when I dared to strike the lyre In loneliness and fear, Who bade me as the Bard aspire, And woke my grateful tear! But, like a vision all are gone To join the world unseen, And when these walls I gaze upon, I ask,—if such have been? Mysterious Charm! Oh, solemn Past, How deeply felt art thou! Beyond the scenes around us cast, The world exciting now. The touching thought—no more! no more! Doth sanctify the room, Where blending Hearts embraced of yore, Now pulseless in the tomb. But, why and whence, we cannot tell, A living moment fails To rule us with that inward spell Which from the past prevails. The perish'd bloom of boyhood's prime How beautiful it seems, When, tinged with melancholy time, It dawns upon our dreams! Forth from the heart there went a hue Which made the world romance; But ah, how changed and chill the view As riper years advance! Rank, wealth, and reputation, all Must leave the breast a void, Whene'er our yearning hearts recall What vanish'd youth enjoy'd. Eternity familiar reads To Faith's perusing eye, As spirit after spirit speeds To populate the sky. Each added year that Home commends Where Souls unbodied dwell, To all, who feel how parted friends Retain their living spell: For while we tread the room they trod And haunt the scene they chose, We love to think they dwell in God, All rapture, and repose! BODILY SUFFERING. “Always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus.”—2 Cor. iv. 10. “I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.”—Gal. vi. 17. “Christ shall be magnified in my body.”— Phil. i. 20. “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God.”—John xi. 4. Who can explain the living dust we bear? That breathing miracle of pain or bliss, Incarnate Soul, what science can declare?— Yet, did we ponder on a truth like this, Each pulse of being would proclaim our God, And preach His wisdom wheresoe'er we trod. But health with such pure harmony of ease The inward play of wonted life preserves, That not till flesh be pierced with sharp disease, Or pang convulsive all the frame unnerves, Are men awaken'd from their godless dream. To mark what mercies in the body teem. Tis now, while throbbing fires of fever burn, Or the vexed life-blood mantles brow and brain, And on his couch, with many a wearied turn, Moans the pale martyr of mysterious pain,— Oft is the soul by lingering sickness taught, A deeper love than health-days ever brought. Oh! how we pine for Nature's freshness now, For wood and wild, and many-voicèd stream, And long to feel upon the wasted brow The quivering gladness of her sun-warm beam, When pining Languor, with dejected eye, Through half-veil'd window sees the orient sky. And blessings, which in hours of heedless calm Were lightly view'd, or out of God partaken, Now they have vanish'd, with remember'd balm Rebuke some thankless Heart they have forsaken; While forms and faces, which indifferent were, Throng round the soul, and thrill it into prayer. The stern seem mild, the harsh attemper'd down To childhood's softness, or to woman's tear, And the false gildings of ambition's crown Grow dimly pale before one righteous fear: Life drops the mask, and all Earth's painted show Melts into gloom, and looks one shaded woe. Soon, conscience wakes; and sin and guilt are seen In the deep blackness of their dismal truth; Clear on the soul, though flesh-veils intervene, Remembrance visions both our age and youth; And faith sees God's detective eyebeams dart Their piercing brightness through the naked heart! O, Thou incarnate Sympathy for all! On earth a Saviour, and in heaven the same, Now to the sick those precious truths recal, Which crown the wonders of Emanuel's name; Calm the wild conscience with a word of peace, And in Thy Merit show the soul's release. For though no malady by Thee was felt, Nor sickness by Thy sacred flesh endured, Ne'er did the music of compassion melt With softer tones, than when some pang was cured; Anguish and grief in Thy pure breast were known, And suffering raised Thee to yon glory-Throne! Then, doubt not, Child of sickness and of woe, When through sad vigils of the wakeful night Thy cup of trial seems to overflow, Till earth be tomb-like to thy weaken'd sight, That Jesu numbers all dark moments bring To harrow Flesh with untold suffering. Heavy, and lone, and long the night-hours wear, And minutes seem with leaden pace to move, But o'er thy couch, when riseth low-breathed prayer, Throbs the pure heart of that almighty Love In Christ embodied, when for man He died, By friends deserted, and by foes denied. Pains are dread mysteries! not from God they came By pure creation, when man's perfect mould Of outward beauty to the inward frame Of innocence did fine proportion hold:— From sin and self, all pangs and pains begun, That since the Fall their withering course have run. But mercies hover o'er a sick man's bed, Wing'd for descent, on lenient plumes of love, And virtues oft from frail disease are bred, Which ripen souls for sainted bliss above: Health needs a cross, whose Christ-like touch shall thrill The fainting treason of our palsied will. And but for sickness, health would rarely be What by dread contrast Trial lives to know,— From God direct, a pure gratuity Sent from His heart and hand, to Whom we owe Not grace alone our forfeit souls to save, But all pure mercies which precede the grave. And, ah! what purity from pain hath sprung, That in the turbid rush of healthful joys Seems lost, and leaves wild passion warm and young, To Earth's delirium, and her base alloys; For sufferings oft etherealize the heart, Till false emotions into faith depart. Silence and solitude a lull beget, Or tame Life's pulses into hallow'd rest, Chasten the mind, and calm that secret fret Man's harsher world-life chafes within the breast, As rivers, tranced by some Canadian frost, Have turn'd to lakes, and all defilement lost. Thus may pale sickness prove a blessed Thing, And pain achieve, what pleasure never can,— Teach the gay heart, beneath th' Almighty wing, To learn the mystery of redemption's plan,— How faith by suffering must to glory soar, And drink the cup her Master drank before. GOD'S IMAGE. “God created man in His Own image, in the image of God created He him.”—Gen. i. 27. As Lord of this terrestrial sphere, Semblance divine did Man appear; Just moulded by the hand of God, The soil of virgin earth he trod, And when through his mysterious frame In gushes of pure rapture came Bright feelings born of innocence, And sanction'd by Omnipotence, O God! Thine Image was enshrined In the clear depths of his calm mind. “Man in Our Image,”—mighty thought! With more than human meaning fraught; For, how can sinner's filmèd eye The glories of that Speech descry? How can the soil'd and earth-bound soul Itself release from blind control, And thus, from passion nobly free, Hail the crown'd work of Deity,— Perfection in the dust began, God's “image” in the soul of man? Alas! the words beyond us soar; Dead Paradise revives no more; For in the soil where thorns abound God's curse still preaches from the ground, And Labour, with its sunken brow Of weariness, fulfils it now; And in the soul, lo! all is sin; Darkness and death prevail within, Where Self is like a Satan throned, A hell preferr'd, and God disown'd! God's “image,” is it seen below In this sad world of blight and woe? Where can we view its peerless grace, And look upon that perfect face Which lightens up with Deity, Till Angels their own likeness see, And transcripts of such glory shine, That they reflect the looks Divine? In priest, or poet, saint, or sage, In parted years, or present age? Go! search mankind from pole to pole, The archives of the past unroll, Consult the chart of history, As read in hoar antiquity, Select, combine, and concentrate The models of our good and great, The paramounts of man and mind, The lords and lights of human Kind,— And, then we challenge each and all, To make God's “image,” since the fall! In human light a darkness lies; All human love a hate supplies; Our human wisdom folly stains; O'er human strength a weakness reigns; To human virtue baseness clings; And Glory mounts on sullied wings; Love, Truth, and Wisdom, Virtue, all Our wav'ring creeds perfection call, What are they, in God's balance weigh'd, But sin, by gilded self array'd? Thus, imperfection mars and maims What Nature for her noblest claims; The upas-blight, the poisoning breath Of inward guilt and moral death, Lurks in the soul of whatsoe'er Men laurel as the bright and fair.— “God's image,” then, oh! where on earth Can Faith behold its beauteous worth? Where can we sun our hearts awhile In virtues which no stains defile? Thou Third in Godhead! Holy Ghost, The Christian's life, the Church's boast, Pure Helper of the heart's distress, And Cheerer of lone weariness, The inward Sun of heaven-born souls, Who all their prayer and praise controls, To Thee, true Paraclete! we owe The all of God that lives below,— What broken fragments yet may shine Of that whole “Image” once Divine. There is a sacramental birth, A promise of baptismal worth, A life from heaven to earth sent down, A jewel dropt from Jesu's crown, A power that with celestial art Can renovate the ruin'd heart; Unheard, unseen, unscann'd, unknown, This wonder-work is all Thine own; The power is felt, 'tis born of Thee, Yet who, dread Spirit! grace can see? But, let God's image be restored, Let guilt be wash'd, and sin deplored, And saintly virtues, meek and mild, Will shadow forth God's chosen child; Without, within, by faith and prayer Will breathe that reverential air, That shows the world what Christ hath done, The trophies which the Cross hath won In winning back what Adam lost,— A forfeit Soul, at such a cost! But oh, blest Lord! if men would see The perfect type of Deity, Then, from the Church's child of grace We turn, to look on Thy sad face, O Man of Sorrows! Son of God! As o'er the world Thy way was trod, Each living impress of Thy love To man below shows God above, While in Thy doctrine, death, and tears, Jehovah in our flesh appears. THE DYING GIRL. [INSCRIBED TO PHILIP ROSE, ESQ., THE FOUNDER OF THE HOSPITAL FOR CONSUMPTION.] “Her sun is gone down while it was yet day.” Jer. xv. 9. CONSUMPTION. A beauty clothes the hectic cheek, A radiance fills the sunken eye, But when her mellow'd accents speak, They make the sadden'd hearer sigh; For, softer sink they in their cadence far Than Autumn's dying tone, beneath some mournful star. They bore her to that healthful Isle Whose rocks of terraced verdure rise And catch the Morn's celestial smile, Responsive to the greeting skies; And vainly prophesied, the island-breeze Would freshen her white cheek, and waft away disease. But there she sicken'd, day by day, In shrinking paleness, like a flower, Yet from her glance there flash'd a ray Of almost supernat'ral power;— So bright the lustre of her eye-beam fell, It touch'd the tender mind with more than woman's spell. For mother too, and far-off home, Her plaintive heart in secret cried; And backward long'd her soul to roam,— Since in the churchyard, side by side Under the green turf, where loved sisters lay, She hoped her dust might wait the awful Judgment-day. And, there behold her once again In her own room with placid brow,— So pale, you see each azure vein Meander through her beauty now; Yet, like a pulse of rosy light at even, Oft to her faded cheek a crimson flush is given. Seldom she sighs, but veils within Much that would grieve fond Love to know, And when some pensive tears begin, She tries to check their overflow; Safe in the arms of Jesu rests her soul, Nor does the early grave with gloom the mind control. Not for herself, but for the heart Of Love maternal, she could weep; And often in young dreams will start, As girlish days through mem'ry sweep, While faintly through her lips there steals a word,— And, “Oh! my mother dear!” is like low music heard. She dies,—as Beauty ever dies When sad consumption finds a tomb; With brilliance in her deep-set eyes, And on her face a healthless bloom; No harsh transition, but a soft decay, Like dream-born tones of night, which melt by dawn away. They wheel her round each garden-walk Where oft her lisping childhood play'd, And loved to hear the old nurse talk And soothe her when she seem'd afraid, While danced her ringlets as she prattled on, More playful than the birds she loved to gaze upon. She looks, as they alone, who feel The last of earth before them lies, While o'er them soften'd mem'ries steal Which melt the heart into the eyes,— For, tree and turret, woods and uplands, all Back to the dying girl her childish past recall! Dream-like the hush of twilight floats, Veiling the lilac-bowers around; While in the air melodious notes Of soft dejection sweetly sound: The Landscape, like a conscious mourner, seems To lie in brooding shade, and sadden as it dreams. Now, to her chamber home return'd, Before the casement there reclined, Just as the broad horizon burn'd With the last blush Day left behind, Her eye reposed upon the dying sun, Fading like feeble youth, before life's course is run. Hush'd is the breezeless air, and deep The awe around each mourner stealing; Bend o'er her form, but do not weep,— Death is too grand for outward feeling! As sinks the sun beneath yon golden sea, So ebbs her spirit back to God's eternity. THE HOSPITAL. She dies, as countless martyrs die Beneath the blast of that Disease, Which summons to th' immortal sky All ages for their blest release:— Not for the dead, but for the living mourn, And childless mothers' hearts, and homes bereaved and lorn! But oh, unlike that beauteous maid Who died in mercy, truth, and prayer, Millions expire on damp stones laid With none to watch them wither there; Creedless and hopeless, fever'd, sad, and lone, Their life an anguish seems, their death a muffled groan! Compassion! 'tis for such we plead; Open thine hand, protect the poor, And Christ, who soothed Creation's need, Shall bless thy basket and thy store; Counting all mercies to the orphan shown, As done unto Himself, when Earth beholds His Throne. And Thou, on Whom disease and health Alike for stay and hope depend, A godlike heart bestow on Wealth, And let the strong the weak defend; Till charity in perfect type appear, And leave the glow of heaven on this benighted sphere. Guard then, O Lord! that sacred pile Whose walls o'ershade the sick and poor, For there, Thine own benignant smile Descends to gild each opening door; And where the pale ones in consumption lie, Some gracious beams bestow of Thine o'er-watching eye! The Saviour in the poor man lives Reflected through his pain and grief; And he who to the wretched gives, To Christ himself imparts relief. And therefore, Shrine of Hope! we hail thy walls, Where true compassion works what God on earth recalls. And faith from out this calm disease May waft to heaven its holy breath, Ere the last sigh hath brought release, And smile away the gloom of death; For wan consumption lets the spirit pray, And leaves the mind to act amid serene decay. When fever-throbs of fiery pain Beat through the blood with burning start, How can sublime religion gain A sainted hold upon the heart? To human sense, a ruin man appears, All blacken'd with despair, and blind with hideous fears. But, Mercy! thou canst cheer the bed Where gradual weakness gently dies, As o'er the life past sin hath led Repentance heaves accepted sighs; And that which careless Health had never taught, Some hallow'd Sickness oft to erring souls has brought. And, Lord, this blissful hope we nurse, That many a wild and wand'ring Soul Who reap'd in crime Thy dooming curse, And heard its coming thunders roll, Here, in this guardian home of peace and love, May shed the precious tears glad Angels greet above. SOCIAL, AND YET ALONE. “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.”—Gen. ii. 18. “It is not good for man to be alone,” Thus spake the Godhead from his viewless Throne; And yet, if ever Soul might be In solitude divinely free, 'Twas when emotion through the young earth ran, As the first sunbeam fell on perfect man. Though all without was beautiful and bright, And grace within made intellectual light, While sinless heart and loyal will Harmoniously did each fulfil The law of love, by wisdom round them thrown,— It seem'd not good that man should be alone. It is not “good!” for That most awful Three Whose name is Love, whose shrine, Eternity, In plural bliss for aye commune; Their Godhead is a blest Triune, Eternal One in Three, and Three in One, Unfathom'd, Infinite, and Unbegun! But erring, sinful, branded as we are, How little each another's heart can share! How much within us, none can know; What feelings Words might blush to show, Hid from the fondest eye which ever gazed Under the shroud confiding friendship raised! And tones are felt of individual heart We cannot, if we would, by breath impart,— So deep, so delicate they glide Under the soul's mysterious tide; Blent with those shifting thoughts that form and die, Too faint for words, too subtle for a sigh. And who has not, in those ideal hours When Nature marshals her majestic powers Which mountain, sky and ocean yield, Tempests awake, or torrents wield,— Within him felt, what speech has not convey'd, And soft tears only to the sense display'd? Or, when a sun-burst of entrancing good Gladdens our being into gratitude, And thoughts emotionally bright Leap in the heart like waves of light, How have our quiv'ring lips refused to speak What flush'd its meaning through our raptured cheek! And often too, when sorrow's milder gloom Shades the still bosom into memory's tomb, When buried friends of boyish days Deep yearnings in our spirit raise, How vain the effort to unwind the zone Which girds the heart, and keeps it all alone! And thou, Religion!—who can half unfold The spells divine thy deeper graces hold? Before mute conscience lies a screen That hides from human words, I ween, Those loving secrets and those solemn fears Which God interprets through our spirits' tears. And thus, a sense there is, in which alone We must be,—for the soul cannot be shown; And hence, all life is loneliness; Our highest moods are echoless; Single we live, in solitude we die, For each heart only can itself descry. But still, what self-born dangers e'er infest The man, who cloisters in monastic breast Feelings and hopes, which God intends As living cords, to fasten friends In that sweet bond of amity and love Form'd by the angels, when they sing above! Sternly alone, forbid us, Lord! to be; Warm our chill minds, and centre them on Thee; Bought by one price, Thy precious Blood! And in Thy church, a brotherhood, With God's elected may we ever meet In mystic oneness at Thy mercy-seat. For what, though morbid Sentiment may dream That nought so like a bosom'd heaven can seem, That man himself from man should hide, And soul by soul be undescried,— The heart collapses into coldness, when We nurse no feeling for our fellow-men. Social in essence is the christian's God; Social in life, the scene our Saviour trod; And selfish chains contract the mind, That should encircle human kind, Reflecting Him, who veils His awful throne, And dwells in Glory that is not alone. GREAT UNTRUTH. “Ye shall not surely die.”—Gen. iii. 4. “Ye shall not surely die,” Dark speech! that dared defy The God of Glory, Who created man, And, save yon mystic tree, Heaven's garden left him free, Where rich the streams of primal music ran. A love was in that law Beyond what Reason saw, Whereby obedience would have hallow'd bliss: It typed a truth divine,— That man, oh God! was Thine, And should have learnt it by a law like this. A ruin'd Angel came; Yet not on wings of flame, With lustres wreath'd around his kingly brow; But, in a serpent-form Conceal'd his venom'd charm, And poison'd Man to what we see him now! Oh! deep as dread the spell The Arch-fiend wove so well, Who whisper'd treason unto creatures fair, Which, pure from guilt and guile, Beneath God's holy smile Bright Priest and Priestess of creation were. Tremendous was their fall! And dark the fiendish thrall Which so encompass'd with corrupting power Both soul and body then, That on the race of men Came death,—the penance of that dooming hour! And doth the Tempter cease? Hath Earth obtain'd release From all the blighted Seraph can employ,— That stains our yielded soul, And, by undreamt control, Heaven's inward light may darken or destroy? The wide world answers, No! For, still he reigns below, And syllables in spirit o'er again The magic of that word Primeval woman heard; “Ye shall not die,”—yet sounds that impious strain! “Ye shall not surely die!” Men listen to the Lie That so enchains them to the serpent's doom, For passion, pride, and will To God act treason still, Nor heed what thunders roll beyond the tomb. O! Virtue, Love, and Truth, Array'd in vernal youth With life before ye, like a long romance, Why not to Grace retreat, Who from the Mercy-seat Lifts o'er your perill'd ways her watching glance? Believe that sin is death, That poison taints its breath, Nor ever by the grave-stone thoughtless be; For sepulchres can preach, And pallid conscience reach With sermons on sin-hating Deity. Unweave that serpent-lie “Ye shall not surely die,” Spirit of grace! within these hearts of ours; And by Truth's cheering ray Disperse sad doubts away, And seal with holiness men's ransom'd powers. And thus, though tombs remain, And still the loathèd chain Of sin and sorrow bind us to the earth, When once the fight is o'er, Emanuel! we shall soar To share Thy kingdom of the second birth. THE WEEPING CHRIST. “Jesus wept.”—John xi. 35. There is a mute but mighty voice in tears,— Words of the eyes, that passionately weep A liquid eloquence, which Pity hears Gush from the heart's unfathomable deep. Whether soft teardrops, like a starry dew, Bedim the eyeballs of some beauteous child, Till the soul glistens through their heaven of blue Mournfully bright, or exquisitely wild; Or, drawn from depths where burning silence glows, From passion-fountains, or, from feeling's soul When like a heart-rain, inward grief o'erflows, And down pale woman's cheek the rich tears roll; Or, if in shaded walk, or crowded street, Some iron visage where cold harshness dwells, Melted and mild, in tears we chance to meet,— How are we moved by all sad contrast tells! Yet Painting, Poetry, nor Pathos can Touch the pure mind with such majestic pain, As when from eyelids of the Son of Man Roll'd human tears, untinged by human stain! But, with that pain a blissful feeling blends, Born of this thought,—our Lord beside the grave, True to our nature, was sublime of Friends, And sympathized with those He came to save. Awfully veil'd a God in Flesh appears! But, Faith is challenged to a deeper awe When she beholds Him with subduing tears Hallow the scene delighted Angels saw. And to that grave-scene, turn thee, mortal, now; Where Jesu wept, true hearts will often be,— And while we gaze upon His awful brow Come, Holy Ghost! and let us learn from Thee How no immunities divine remove Incarnate Mercy from our common doom; Down to our tears descends His mortal love With eyes which moisten'd to behold a tomb! And may Suggestion, with a sacred awe, Dream that He wept the cited dead should come Forth from those glories which the spirit saw In the bright region of its boundless home? If to this lovely creed the heart may cling, Then, O pale weeper! for the loved and gone, Ne'er wilt thou yearn once more on earth to bring Back to life's gloom, some dead, but glorious one. Emanuel wept!—enough this truth to know; Lord of our spirit, let Thy tear-drops fall Full on sad hearts, till faith's responsive glow Warm the cold breast to cry, “My All in All!” Religion, Friendship, Feeling, Love, and Truth, All in Thy tears a consecration find, To soothe worn age, or sanctify wild youth, And haunt the temple of each tender mind. And when bereaved ones o'er the coffin bend To hear the earth-clod with an echoing heart, Saviour, who wept for Thine unrisen friend, Breathe o'er the soul the sympathy Thou art! VANITY OF ALL CREATED GOOD. “Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”—Eccles. i. 2. “The creature was made subject to vanity.”—Rom. viii. 20. “Arise and depart, for this is not your rest.” —Micah ii. 10. There is no rest for man below, Soil'd earth is not our home; The sigh must heave, the tear must flow, Howe'er for bliss we roam. The hollowness of human things, The wear of fev'rish thought, Each to the heart a shadow brings From tombs of mem'ry brought. A broken cistern ev'rywhere Proves nature's purest joy; Though fresh the draught imagined there, How soon we taste alloy! Yet still, prophetic youth believes Bright Edens must abound; And fairy Hope fond visions weaves, As o'er enchanted ground. But soon dark years instruction bring, And teach the lesson grave, That over earth's most radiant thing The cypress-banners wave. The burden and the mystery Of Life will soon be felt, As truths beyond cold Sense to see, Will through our being melt: Upon thee, like an inward weight Eternity will lie, And conscience bow beneath the freight Of thoughts which never die. The poet's wreath, the warrior's plume, And hero's envied bays,— They cannot hide the haunting tomb, Nor lengthen out thy days. The cankerworm of coming death Begnaws the core of all Blithe youth, with its impassion'd breath, Would fain perfection call. And yet 'tis hard, when vernal health Glows brightly on the cheek, When Learning, Beauty, Wit, and Wealth Their wonted homage seek; When life a lovely Poem seems, Whose ev'ry line appears Descriptive of those sunny dreams That dazzle future years, 'Tis hard to think of grave and gloom, In such glad hour as this, And pile, in thought, the distant tomb That shall contain our bliss! But oh, believer young and bright, With heart and hope awake, Come hither! and with soul aright Truth's sober lesson take. Were this vast world, with all its joy, Its glories, crowns, and charms, Secured from change and sad alloy, At once within thine arms, E'en then, thy heart would hunger still, And oft in secret pine; The universe would fail to fill A spirit vast as thine! Christ, or despair! — behold thy fate To that sole choice is bound; And blest are they, who not too late Their heaven in God have found. For, such will learn to look on all Bewilder'd passions love, As Sin and Satan's blinding thrall To keep us from above. And yet, that Book which thus reveals Life's baseless dream below, And on the heaven false worldlings feel, Writes words of death and woe, Say, is it not the page profound Which opens realms divine, And, where no pangs nor pains abound, Cries, “Christian! they are thine?” Then, bids thee, eagle-like, to soar Right upward for the sun, And not this gilded world deplore Where peace is never won? Thy home is yonder pangless clime Where saints and martyrs meet, And with this choral-burst sublime Anthem the mercy-seat, “Worthy the Lamb! for sinners slain, Who once the wine-press trod, Eternity shall be His reign, Who ransom'd men for God!” VOICE OF GOD IN THE COOL OF THE DAY. “They heard the Voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.”—Gen. iii. 8. How soothing, when the noise of day is o'er And fever'd heart-cares sink, becalm'd and cool, To wind the bay of some receding shore, And bathe our spirit in the beautiful! Creation is no mute unconscious mass Of pregnant matter, into being plann'd, For, when behind the outer-veil we pass, Faith hears it speaking of Emanuel's hand. The blood-priced earth's a Sacrament of Him Whose regal glories make man's All in All, Under Whose throne both saints and seraphim, Inflamed with burning adoration, fall. There was a time when Eve and Adam heard His voice almighty through soft twilight roll, And, like glad waters by deep music stirr'd, They felt it echo'd by responsive soul. But, when dark Treason like a hell-cloud rose And guilt between them and His glory came, The full warm current of affection froze, And Conscience shudder'd at Jehovah's name! “I heard Thy voice, and hid myself, afraid, For naked horrors scared the inward eye, And while my ruin'd soul was thus display'd, The ground beneath me mutter'd, ‘Thou shalt die!’” Oh! dread confession of our fallen doom, That men are exiles from their God, afar, That souls are pall'd with atheistic gloom, And, but for grace, would perish as they are. For like as Adam shrunk behind a tree, And paled with cowardice to look on God, Revolting hearts the Holy Presence flee, And tread the path that first transgressor trod. But, Lord of heaven! when Thy relenting hand The ruin'd soul hath reconciled with Blood, And Thy blest will, by holiness preferr'd, Becomes at once our glory and our good, Then, unlike Adam, by dark guilt appall'd, We shrink no longer from the Voice Divine, But love to hear it in our hearts recall'd, And see creation with redemption shine. The challenge dread, “Where art thou?” booms no more, But, “Here are we,” anticipates the cry; For Sinai's thunders hush their penal roar, And sound as gently as Emanuel's sigh. Where shall we hie to hear that mystic tone? To halls of Splendour, or to homes of Sin? Not there, my brother! can The Voice be known Whose breath is music heard from God within! But if thine ear be tender, clear, and true, And sensual clay no longer clog the mind, Then may thy soul His hidden glory view, And hear Christ vocal in the wave and wind. Whether, if cherub Morn her wings unfold, And drops of balm each glade and glen array, Thou lov'st to mark the orient mists uproll'd, While ope the eyelids of commencing Day. Or, on the marble sea, at noon entranced, In breezeless glory rock'd to living rest, From some lone cliff thy pensive eye has glanced, Till ocean's calm lay mirror'd on thy breast; Or, thou hast mused at sunset, sad and pale, By pebbled shore where plaintive waters meet, Till gradual Twilight dropt her dewy veil, And dark the seaweed slumber'd at thy feet,— Alike in all a saintly mind can hear Some tone celestial, like a spirit glide, And breathe to Nature that her God is near, And all her spell-work by His hand supplied. And thus, dear Lord! in what we do, or dare, Be Thy meek virtues our most glorious choice; From sea and mountain may we lift our prayer, And hear creation echo'd with Thy Voice. In the cool evening of life's calm decay Soft o'er the soul may lulling whispers fall, And Wisdom teach our filial hearts to pray “Father in Heaven! for home prepare us all.” GOD'S CURSE UPON THE GROUND. “Cursed is the ground for thy sake ? Thorns, also, and thistles, shall it bring forth to thee.”— Gen. iii. 17, 18. Though sumless mercies teem around In ocean, earth, and air, Mysterious vengeance haunts the ground,— A curse is cleaving there! The thorn which mars our blighted fields, The thistle that appears, Each to our soul a lesson yields Becoming thoughtful fears. And, add to this the weariness On Manhood's sunken brow, The burden and the bitterness Which darken Labour now, Together with the barren soil That gives a stern reply, To hearts that tend and hands which toil Beneath a threatful sky,— These unrelenting symbols tell, O'er this sad World of ours The frownings of Jehovah fell, And blighted all her bowers! Unbeautified and bare they seem Her landscapes, scenes, and all Which once surpass'd the Muse's dream, And men Elysium call. The curse of sin's avenging God Hath sear'd the blasted earth, And glooms of His judicial rod Hang o'er us from our birth:— Yet, with the curse Compassion weaved A mystery of love, And Angels o'er the past who grieved, Sang wonder-hymns above To see while Godhead in His wrath The gates of Eden closed, Calm o'er the exiled sinner's path A ray of Christ reposed!— Light in our darkness yet remains, Flowers bloom among our weeds; And Grace unbinds the loathèd chains With which tried Nature bleeds. And Thou art branded, fiendish One! Who tempted man to sin, A hell in hell thy crime hath won, To blast despair within. And ye! the guilty heirs of dust Who fain from earth would fly, Stand, and be doom'd by heaven ye must,— Can God Himself deny? But good shall out of evil spring, And love with judgment blend, For, round the curse God's ransom'd sing, “Our Father! and our Friend!” And though pale mothers here may read Of birth-pangs, and their woes, Yet is not Christ the woman's seed, Whom earth to mother owes? And if round spousal love there winds A thorny wreath of care, Myriads of married Hearts and Minds Prove wedlock pure and fair: Men are not tyrants, though they rule, If christian lords they be; And women by subjection school Their love for liberty. And never be this truth forgot, That Wedlock is a sign, The Church endures no widow'd lot, Her Husband is divine! And though cold Earth reluctant now Brings forth her fruits and flowers, While sweating anguish damps the brow By work, and wearied hours, Yet in that toil emotions lurk To keep the heart awake;— Where is our wisdom, if no work Our laggard dreams can break? And from the soil we plough and turn With labour's ceaseless hand, Religion may her Bible learn, And think of God's command! Thus, though the sentence, “Dust thou art,” And low in dust shalt be, Booms like a knell within the heart When wrung by memory, Yet may the trump of Easter sound O'er each sepulchral sod, “Awake! thou sleeper, from the ground, And gaze upon thy God!” WEEP NOT FOR THE DEAD. “Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him.” Jer. xxii. 10. Oh, weep not for the holy dead Embosom'd in their God, But rather that high pathway tread Their sainted virtues trod: Their home is now the tearless clime Where sins nor sorrows reign, And all the pure they lost in time True Hearts embrace again. The Lord who came our souls to save Dead Laz'rus did not mourn, But His sublime compassion gave To sisters left forlorn. It must be so; for ponder well, When God's award is given, Love cannot rescue vice from hell, Nor pity saints in heaven. 'Tis true, as thoughtful years advance We muse with sadden'd mind, When mem'ry throws a tearful glance On scenes long left behind! Where have they fled, the brave and dear. The brightest of the throng, Who gladden'd home's delighted sphere With sunshine and with song? 'Twere vain to tell us not to weep, When Mem'ry opes that tomb Where buried Joys in darkness sleep, That fill'd young life with bloom. For often in some bleak distress The dead upon us rise, As though they knew our loneliness, And echo'd back our sighs. 'Tis then the heart-dew riseth fast, And moisten'd eye-beams tell Our Souls are with the solemn past, And feel its mighty spell! And will not gentle Bosoms weep, To think what pangs we gave To friends above whose dreamless sleep Funereal banners wave?— How often might some healing word, Or tone of kindness spoken, With love's divinest thrill have stirr'd A heart that seem'd half broken! GLORY OF DEPARTED SAINTS. “Absent from the body—present with the Lord.” 2 Cor. v. 8. Hail to the bright and blissful Choir Who wreathe the Saviour's throne! Eternity hath strung their lyre, And Glory gives the tone: We mourn them not, we mourn them not, Who crowd the halls of Heaven, For theirs is now the pangless lot, The smile of saints forgiven. Through shades of wintry loneliness While here our pathways wind As orphans in the soul's distress We seek some answ'ring mind, Yet, proves it like some balmy dream From heaven just floating down, When round our yearning fancies beam The lustres of their crown! On this bad earth, like us, they knew The with'ring curse of sin; Or shudder'd o'er some hideous view Of dawning hell within: The wingèd thoughts which bravely soar'd Beyond the realms of time, Those deepest prayers that once ador'd The King of Kings sublime, What were they, in their rapt delight Outsoaring all we feel,— But bird-wings broken in their flight, When storm-blasts round them wheel? Upward and upward did they rise From earth's pollution free, Those Eagles of the Lord, whose eyes Glow'd with eternity! But oh, at best, they did but scan Far off that living Sun, By whose rich glory rescued Man From darkness hath been won. But now, the coil of earth removed, No sins their conscience stain; We call them dead,—but Their Beloved Becomes a deathless gain. They sun their souls in living rays, His Form of glory darts, While swells of superhuman praise Heave from their burning hearts. Then, who would call them back to earth These holy Dead, on high? No! rather let their peerless worth Attract us to the sky: Their task is o'er, their toil is done, Embower'd in bliss they dwell, And would we wear the crown they won?— Then, let us fight as well! Far better this, than mourn the dead By selfish grief inspired; Their path to glory may we tread, By pure example fired: So shall we reach our home at last, Whate'er the wilds we trod, And find the dead from earth who pass'd Were still our friends in God. THE RELIGION OF SOLITUDE. “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not ? this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”—Gen. xxviii. 16, 17. Lone nature is no loneliness to me, Her solitude makes my society, For there I listen to a Voice that seems Like heaven-tones heard by prophets in their dreams. Serenely awful o'er my trancèd soul I hear the music of th' Almighty roll, And each deep cadence oft appears to tell,— “My Hand o'ershades thee, though invisible!” Thus have I felt, in regions wild and lone Where Nature loves to rear her rocky throne, Where nought intrudes to mar the tranquil mind, And nothing murmurs but the mountain-wind, Or, happy brooks which down the hillocks play And sing, like birds in sunbeams far away, Or, glancing bees that o'er the wood-born flowers Whirl their gay dance, and hum away the hours. Yet, perfect solitude there cannot be, Since all around us acts Divinity; Like space to body, so is God to soul, Who all created, and contains the whole. The hush of Nature may be holy calm Breathed by blest Angels, when they spread the balm Of beauteous quiet o'er the heart of things, And veil the landscape with their viewless wings. When wearied Jacob, pillow'd on the stone, Slumber'd at dewy night, he seem'd alone; What Sense beheld, no sacred token found That Haran's desert was a haunted ground: But, when a dream-power purified his glance, His eye unseal'd, survey'd in wondrous trance Angels ascending and descending there, And when he woke—he trembled into prayer! And so, round us may guardian Spirits move To ply unseen soft ministries of love, While we walk careless o'er the greenwood sod, Nor rev'rence nature as instinct with God. Then read creation with religious eye, If God and angels thou wouldst there descry, To which alone the Patriarch's dream is given,— A mystic ladder linking earth with heaven. FIRST EXILES. “The Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden.”—Gen. iii. 23. Though earth abounds with choral streams, And sunny gladness smiles and gleams O'er forest glade and woodland-flower, Yet man has lost his fairest bower! With arching glory bright and blue Though heaven attract the minstrel's view, And bird and breeze, upon the wing, Their lyric strain in concert sing, Yet may each pure poetic spot Where grief and guilt are most forgot, Faint shadows of our exile feel Around it, like dark memory, steal. For, there intrudes an aching thought, A feeling with dejection fraught, An under-tone of discontent With our serenest rapture blent. The whence, and why, we cannot tell,— But girt we are with such a spell; A zone mysterious which can bind And oft enclose the calmest mind. Who hath not felt such worldless mood When cloister'd in green solitude, With nothing near, but earth and sky, And none to read him, but God's eye! And oft, too, when we cease to roam Amid the heaven of virtuous home, With leisure, books, and wedded love, And peace and pureness from above, E'en then, a craving thirst will rise For more than present bliss supplies; Soft yearnings through the spirit melt, And seek what soul hath never felt. Whence come these moods? we vainly ask:— “Oh! why is life a wearied task, Where unreposing trials speak, The world is sad, and nature weak?” Is it, because no being can The inward deeps of deathless man With such a rich contentment fill, As leaves the conscience lull'd, and still? Or, shall we find the felt unrest That haunts the hour most deeply blest, In man's indwelling plague of sin,— The venom'd fire that burns within? Yea, these, and more than we divine, May round these perill'd hearts combine, To darken with unearthly hues Our radiant hours, and richest views. And when we know, that Adam's fall O'er bright creation drew a pall, And over man and nature cast The shadow of a ruin'd past, Behold! the myst'ry half unwinds, Why sadness dims some holy minds, And mild dejection inly sighs For brighter scenes, and bluer skies. It is because, like exiles we, When roaming on a foreign sea, While pilgrim waves approach the strand, Are dreaming of our own far land; And thus to realms of gracious thought Are mystic recollections brought Of vanish'd Eden, and the bowers, Where God and innocence were ours. As exiled ones, a branded race Whom sin and self alike disgrace, Say, ought we not, where'er we roam, By faith to see our forfeit home? And never, oh! Thou Source of Light, Let this cold earth become too bright; Lest, world-enamour'd we may grow, And root our hearts in bliss below. Rather on high, ascended Lord! Lift we our souls on Thy loved word, And through God's Eden yearn to rove That blooms and brightens with Thy Love. MODERATION. “Give me neither poverty nor riches.”—Prov. xxx. 8. I will not sigh for vast domains, For festive halls and homes of pleasure, Nor do I seek redundant gains To heap my huge and hoarded treasure; But this I dare to ask,—a placid mind In every pulse of thought to heaven resign'd. There is a wealth in calm desires, In chaste content and holy feeling, Beyond their reach whom gold inspires, But madly from themselves are stealing That more than jewel'd mines those hearts possess, Which beat secure in God's almightiness. Extremes are not what man endures Unless by heavenly wisdom guided; And Gain the heart to guilt allures, When once a soul becomes divided Between what God and duty only claim From all baptised into Emanuel's name. Thus, riches prove a deadly gift Which oft corrupt each calmer blessing, And to such height the mind uplift, That soon it shrinks from e'er confessing How all we have, and are, or hope to be, Flows from the fountain-grace of Deity. 'Tis sad to think how gilded clay Hath tempted man from God, and glory! And lured him on the broad bad way Which Christ reveals in warning story; That path whose breadth doth equal Passion's will, And widens ever to increase the ill. But there is wealth for all whose eyes Can hail true charms around them glowing, And more than mines in those supplies Creation's scenes are e'er bestowing, Would men but love them with congenial mind And seek pure riches, such as God design'd. Here is an heritage for all, A patrimonial bliss unbounded, The ruin'd orphans of the world may call Their own, howe'er by want surrounded:— Of Nature's glories none but Hearts complain Whose coldness feels their inspiration vain. Then, bless we God for this bright world, Its majesty of form and motion, For all the beams by Light unfurl'd Which grace the earth, or gild the ocean; For the mild lisp of each melodious breeze And word-like whisper of those conscious trees! Nor be forgot the seasons' change In rounds of restless life recurring, Through which the poet's eye can range, And feel his lyric bosom stirring, When oft he views in vestal skies afar The dream-like radiance of some throbbing star. And are there not, apart from gold And haughty Grandeur's sumptuous dwelling, True mercies, which the pure behold With silent hymns of gladness swelling,— Health, food, and raiment, and the countless store Of blessings, that enwreath some cottage door? Bright homes of bliss, and hearths of joy With Love's glad face upon us beaming, And genial friends, whose smiles destroy Autumnal shades, when doubt lies dreaming; The infant's prattle, and the mother's tone Whose wedded heart seems throbbing through our own! Yes, these are more than gold can gain, And often fly the haunts of splendour, Whose pomp excites ambitious pain And leaves the selfish heart untender,— Dead to its God, and cold to all who plead, When doom'd to lie like Lazarus in his need. And add to this, that Book Divine!— The God in language manifested, Where glory streams from each true line By earth and heaven for aye attested; Ah! none are poor who call such volume theirs, And of its promises are heaven-born heirs. And we have sacraments and rites The holy Church to all presenteth, With peaceful hopes and pure delights To each whose tearful soul repenteth,— Prayers, hymns, and chants, and hallelujahs deep Whose choral thunders round the dim aisles sweep. Nor let us, with unloving mind, Forget what art and science granteth, What music yields to ears refined When harps resound, or Woman chanteth; True are such pleasures, innocently loved, By reason sanction'd and by heaven approved. Then seek we not for vast domains, For sumptuous halls and homes of pleasure; He more than royal Crœsus gains Who finds in God his gold and treasure:— With Him the destitute have boundless store, But, oh, without Him, Wealth itself is poor! Our noblest wealth is heaven-born grace From out the Spirit's heart descending, Which leaves in men a living trace Of holy truth, their hearts amending: Here are deep riches, fit for realms divine, Gems of pure gold from God's eternal mine. INFANCY IN HEAVEN. “Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.”—Matt. xix. 14. Thou beauteous Morn of sainted rest! Breathing like balm along the troubled breast, Now while the sacred chimes are pealing Floats o'er my soul a soften'd feeling, That springeth not from earth alone;— My heaven-gone babe! I think of thee, Who in thy young eternity A sabbath first wilt call thine own. But one week since, and thou wert here Tender as Morning's crystal tear, A little flutt'ring shape of life Too frail to bear the breath of strife,— We almost fear'd on thee to gaze! While something like prophetic sighs Did from parental hearts arise, When dreaming o'er thine unborn days. Calm innocent! whose helpless charms Lay nestled in thy nurse's arms, We loved to watch each dawning gleam That from thy soul began to beam, And half believed it long'd to smile; And though unlisp'd thy thought expired Within mysterious depths retired,— Thy lip seem'd eloquent the while! 'Twas beautiful in sleep to view The radiance of a rose-like hue Bloom softly o'er thy rounded cheek,— As though some Angel did bespeak Thy spirit with an unvoiced spell; Since more than beauty then array'd Thy features, while their flush betray'd What earth-breathed tones can never tell. How often, when no eye could see, I breathed a father's prayer o'er thee! And where thy little cradle stood Besought the Source of heavenly good Thy life to overshade with love; How did I mark with doating gaze Thy baby wiles and winsome ways, And blest for thee my God above! Such wert thou, ere the Voice Divine, “The first-born, ere it sin, 'tis mine,” Roll'd through our hearts its awful cry! And, softer than aërial sigh, To heaven return'd thine infant-breath; Like a dead lily wert thou laid Ere sin had cast its poison-shade Around thee, white in lovely death. We wept, as they can weep alone Who first a parent's grief have known; And felt as though a life-chord broke At spectral dawn, when Day awoke, And all was breathless in thy room! Oh, there the hush of graves did brood, And awful seem'd the solitude That was to wrap thine early tomb. One last, and long, and clinging look Of thy dead face and form I took, And into memory did receive An image, that shall never leave My soul, while time and truth remain!— Seldom has Death more beauty hid Under a coffin's tiny lid, Than thine, within the churchyard lain. All this thou wast; but what, and where Thy spirit now, can none declare: For, born in sin, baptised and seal'd With grace divine, God bid thee yield Thine innocence to Him on high; Back, like a heaven-bird to its home, Borne by blest Angels, didst thou roam, And vanish'd to thy genial sky. Oh, wond'rous change!—the purest word By mental wisdom breathed, or heard, The brightest dream that can entrance A raptured saint, or martyr's glance, Are all too weak and worthless things E'er to unfold what thou must feel, To whom Heaven's glories now reveal More than the harp of David sings! A nursling wert thou, wan and weak; A sigh was all thy soul could speak; Frailer than new-born lambs which feed When dropp'd upon the sunny mead,— We only trembled, while we gazed, To think that such a cradled form Could weather out life's wasting storm, That must around thy lot be raised. A watch-tick would have been to thee The height of human mystery; A tone, a sunbeam, or a flower Have all surpass'd thy mental power, And rapt thee in amazement deep; But now,—beyond what Saints believe Thy faculties in heaven receive, And neither sin, nor weep! Yes, in a moment, vast the change That must around thy spirit's range Have circled its divine excess Of all which can the glorious bless! While o'er thy manumitted soul, Transcending all the Church hath known Since Christ ascended to His throne,— Voices and visions grandly stole. Baptismal grace and purity, Far more than time, befitted thee For scenes of splendour, which await Bright Spirits in their perfect state,— The sacramental Host in heaven: What lofty minds but half presage, To thee is now an open page Beyond the glance in scripture given. And oh, what bliss, which baffles thought! To think that upward thou art caught To some chaste realm of cloudless joy, Before the touch of earth's alloy Had stain'd the virgin soul with sin; Ere passion, or polluted deed Had caused the harrow'd mind to bleed,— Heaven oped its doors, and let thee in! Thus while yon pensive chimes are pealing Floats o'er my soul a sacred feeling, Mournful, but mild, and full of prayer,— A thought beyond what creeds declare, That thou, sweet babe! art shrined in glory, 'Mid saints and prophets, priests and kings, A Spirit graced with star-bright wings, With innocents who died before thee. Here, in this vale of time and tears While we fulfil our fated years, 'Twill oft refresh my heart to dream What living splendours round thee beam, That issue from The Lamb who died; While lisping cherubs, like to thee, Warble before the Deity Soft anthems to The Crucified. DIVINE WALK. “Enoch walked with God.”—Gen. v. 24. And didst thou choose the narrow path Which sainted feet have ever trod, And know the peace high Virtue hath When pillow'd on the breast of God? Though all around thee crime and sin Their moral desert made and threw, Was thy religion felt within, And outwardly embodied, too? Primeval saint! seraphic man! By ardent grace so fill'd and fired, Thy blest eternity began Before the common age expired. No spectral glooms, no pangs of death, No hollow cheek, no sunken eye, Nor pallid swoon, nor panting breath Betray'd the King of Terrors nigh: Bright trophy of atoning Blood! Thy doom escaped them, one and all; As if thou wert for earth too good Thy native heaven did thee recall. At once to glory upward soar'd Thy being, with unwav'ring flight; No kindred heart thy death deplored, No grave inhumed thee out of sight. Thou wert not!—this seems all we know Of thine unview'd ascent to bliss; What more relates to thee below, Belongs not to a state like this. In flaming cars with steeds of fire Rapt in a whirlwind, didst thou rise, To mingle with that harping Choir Who worship God with wing-veil'd eyes? Or, did some mission'd angel-bands Speed from the bowers of blissful love, To waft thee with encircling hands To thy pure home prepared above? In vain of this and more we dream, Nor how can sainted fancy tell Thy soar outwing'd the solar beam, And vanish'd through the visible! Yet, could we, like an Enoch walk And closely with our God commune, With more than angels men might talk, And earth itself to heaven attune. We should not seek for temple-roof To overarch our heads in prayer, But find in ev'ry scene a proof Jehovah was enshrouded there. The poet's walk through pensive scenes Companion'd with God's love would be, When doubt, nor darkness, intervenes To hide his heart from Deity. All beauty would more beauteous grow, All music more melodious sound, Did moral hues of heaven below More freshly in our ways abound. It is because the Cain-like heart To selfish pride retreats alone, That God and glory dwell apart From that cold bliss we call our own. But when, like Enoch, men can muse, And with our Maker's smile array The path of life they rightly choose, What gleams from heaven adorn their way! Jehovah's will, Jehovah's word, Within, without, rules everywhere; And conscience is obey'd and heard Till man becomes incarnate prayer. Abroad, at home, in sun, or shade, By rocky shore, or mountain-stream, Divinest thoughts the soul invade, And nowhere can we orphans seem; Since Faith applies vast providence To each peculiar grief and groan, And grasps believed omnipotence As though it ruled for Her alone. Awake, and sing then, christian soul! If, like yon saint before the flood, Under the Spirit's true control A frowning world thou hast withstood. Enoch was not;—to God he soar'd, Left a low earth defiled like this, Sought the bright Parent he adored And melted in almighty bliss! Thus, more and more to yonder fount Of perfect glory thou may'st glide; And nearer still like Enoch mount To regions ne'er by sin descried. As He was not, thou shalt not be Discern'd by what the world calls sense— Thy dwelling-place is Deity, And simple Faith thy sure defence. STRIVE NOT WITH THE SPIRIT. “My Spirit shall not always strive with man.” Gen. vi. 3. Most awful booms that word Rolling its cadence deep, Till the roused heart is inly stirr'd From out its iron sleep, When God “repents” He e'er created man, Since like one giant sin, the earth to ruin ran! Can mortal accent tell How heaves th' Eternal Mind, When these divine emotions swell, Commoved by human kind,— “With man My Spirit shall not always strive, For it repents Me now, that such I made alive?” In this the harvest see By Adam's sin first sown! All vices reign, all virtues flee, And from His watching Throne When scans the Godhead our apostate race, No hallow'd feature there can His omniscience trace. For not one thrill of thought Which plays within the soul That is not with rebellion fraught, Now sin hath seized the whole Our flesh and spirit, heart and will include, With utter hate of God, and dread ingratitude! Evil, and nothing more, Behold, man's nature now:— Blest Angels! did ye not deplore, When Earth her wither'd brow Lifted beneath you, in yon spheres of light, And show'd her branded front, of old so pure and bright? But, lo! the hour of wrath, Commission'd from above, Stern vengeance o'er the sinners' path, With whom the Spirit strove, Shall roll in ruin; and the godless world See thunderbolts of death from His fierce anger hurl'd! Insect, and man, and beast, Whatever lives and moves, The lofty sinner, and the least Who madly crime approves,— The broken fountains of the deep shall burst, And sweep them into gloom, like things by God accurst! And is the record dead, Which here unveils to man The ruin early vice had bred, When lawless will began Reason and Conscience both at once to sway, Till, like embosom'd fiends, bad passions had their play? No! judgment never dies, But lives as long as sin The law of love and truth defies, And renders Man within A jarring discord, out of tune with heaven, A wreck of sinful woe, by darkest vices driven. Go, Rebel! take thy stand On some steep rock, which frown'd In fearful gloom above the land By God's vast deluge drown'd,— As if thou heard'st the desolating roar Of billows when they lash'd th' uncoffin'd dead they bore, And there, let Conscience learn A lesson for all time,— That God must aye with anger burn O'er unrepenting crime: He cannot, will not, on the sinner look, Until the weeping Heart hath guilt for grace forsook. Come, then, celestial Grace! Like dew of Hermon steal O'er the dry souls of our sad race, Until they pray and feel; That so Thy Spirit, when He plies His love, May not, by us aggrieved, return to Thee above. For His deep coming, watch With list'ning heart of prayer! And ever lift the inward latch That yields him entrance there; So less and less His strivings will be known, And God's bright Spirit seem commingled with our own. Then, like a temple built By some celestial Hand, No more shall gloom and dreadless guilt Benignant grace withstand, But each pure Soul a living shrine will be, Where Angels view enthroned the awful Trinity. A BELIEVER'S WISH. “To depart and to be with Christ—is far better.” Phil. i. 23. I wish I lived where Jesu reigns In yonder sinless world above, Where not a pang the bosom pains And all is light, for all is love. There, with rapt Seraphims, how sweet Anthems of choral bliss to blend, And thus with white-robed myriads greet, In Glory's form, the sinner's Friend. No self will there the soul defile, No shadows o'er remembrance steal, But conscience, purged from guilt and guile, Shall all the heaven of virtue feel. Those fever-dreams of sense and time Which now profane our purest bliss, Shall not infest that hallow'd Clime With stains which mar a world like this. Oh! bright excess, beyond all thought, When saints have reach'd that radiant goal Where Man, to full perfection brought, In God shall ark his wearied soul! For, what can sense-born pleasure give When most the world itself imparts, But bribes to let base passions live Like serpents in our selfish hearts? The chastest scene, the calmest home By poet hymn'd, or reason blest,— Who has not felt his fancy roam, And image forth a finer rest? Our dream for some diviner world Can never pause in realms of time, When hope's fair wings, by faith unfurl'd, Would waft us to that pangless clime. Safe in the shadow of Thy throne, Reveal'd Almighty! let us dwell, And in yon circling rainbow own The hues which our redemption tell. Thou art, O Christ! the sinner's heaven; Without Thee, man is death and gloom, And only with that word, “forgiven,” Can hearts approach the dismal tomb. Be Thou the vital sun and shield To light our path, and guide our souls; Nor let our tempted bosoms yield Except to what Thy will controls. Life of our life! be all our bliss; Torn from Thy truth, since none are blest; Without Thee, men and angels miss That centre where the creatures rest. And can we doubt, if Godhead find Complacency in Christ the Lord, That He excels whate'er the mind Creates in thought, or calls by word? Ye heavens! though bright your splendour be, Emanuel forms your living fount, And none can rise to Deity Who do not through His merit mount. Then, hail the hour! that summons Man Beyond our sullied earth to soar To Him, Whose finite heaven began When first for sin the cross he bore. HERE WE HAVE NO ABIDING HOME. “Here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.”—Heb. xiii. 14. “They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.”—Heb. xi. 14. Since all we love on earth must die, And swift as hues of morning fly The hopes young bosoms store, Oh, softly let thy feelings twine Round the rich heart thou callest thine,— For soon 'twill beat no more! When first our virgin senses wake And of fair Earth a prospect take, Her treasures, homes, and smiles,— A false eternity arrays The scene that mocks our dazzled gaze With its ambitious wiles. And yet, might reason's colder truth Unveil dark facts to wayward youth, Creation doth not hold A perfect semblance to her past; But everywhere dim shades are cast On what she was of old. The clouds of heaven for ever change; The tints of earth and ocean range Through colour's varied gleam; And all which eyes enamour'd view, Reflect on man that restless hue Which hints our life a dream! The sweetest notes bland music brings To vibrate o'er those moral strings Which make the heart a lyre,— E'en while we listen, lo! they die In lulls of languish, like the sigh Some Angel might respire. And, look upon the face we love! More eloquent than skies above When clothed with chastest light,— Its spell of beauty is the change Expressions leave, as there they range And fascinate our sight. Thus, all we view of scene or sound With sad instruction doth abound, And preach,—“Prepare to part!” For souls can have no resting-place Where sin hath left a with'ring trace, And shadow on the heart. Too many tears our eyelids wet, Too many graves are open'd yet, To leave the mind at peace; And, where the soul, without a thorn To probe it, till it bleeds forlorn, And yearns for heaven's release? And blest are they whom Grace hath brought To bow content before the thought,— Earth's dearest ties are frail; These will not, in the rending hour When Death unveils his darksome power, Like unbelievers, quail! But woe! to wistful hearts that cling To whatsoe'er wild passions bring Of fulness, fire, and force, Till idols mount the bosom-throne, Where God and grace should rule alone The soul's most secret course. And, woe! to young Affection's eye Which half adores what soon must die, And melt in mortal clay; Eternal beauty dwells not here, And ill becomes that tainted sphere Where Death demands his prey. But did we, like the saints of old, Hereafter through this Now behold, What pangs our hearts would save! Eternity our home would seem, And life become a brilliant dream Dissolving o'er the grave. Wild heart of wasteful Youth! begin At once to cool the thirst of sin For ever here to bide; Life, love, and earth can flatter thee, But cannot thy salvation be, Nor death, nor judgment hide. Ah! wert thou touch'd with heavenly love, Did Christ, thy magnet, far above Attract thy veering eyes, How would the wing'd affections mount And flutter near that blissful Fount Who all our heaven supplies! Unwav'ring Souls which pant for bliss, Will feel their perfect treasure is Where nothing false is found; And since in heaven Messiah dwells, They will not dread those bleak farewells With which dark years abound. “Gone to prepare a place for you,”— Hosannah to that promise true! It opens heaven for prayer; If in our souls one pulse there beat Of Godhead, at the mercy-seat, They long to worship there! For heaven is not a desert cold Which cannot human feelings hold, Where Christ as Man is seen; Since they adorn that region bright From earth redeem'd, array'd in white, Who once like us have been. OUR TRUE COMPANION. “Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.”—Luke xxiv. 29. Abide with us! sustaining Lord, abide; Without Thee, vain is all the world beside: When Thou art vanish'd, nought true Souls can see But the sad loneliness that sighs for Thee. The life we bear is oft a burden'd thing Fill'd with a load of varied suffering, Though, mask'd with smiles, the forehead seems to say “My heart is sunshine in its golden play.” A thousand shadows from the soul arise Casting a tinge o'er all young natures prize; E'en from the centre of consummate bliss We inly murmur, “breathes there truth in this?” Without, works mystery; within, the same; And truths, profounder than mere words can name, Float through the mind, like seraph-whispers sent From the far glories of God's firmament. Lofty but low, abased and yet sublime, With hearts eternal in a home of time, Sinful, but sainted, doom'd on earth to walk, And yet with Seraphim in spirit talk,— Extremes of contrast! such our being rule; And fever'd Life, with contradiction full, Can echo the beseeching twain who cried, “Lord of our souls, for ever with us bide!” The beautiful and bright, creation yields From rock and dale, from forest and from fields, Lacking Thy presence, want that master-grace Which decks the earth with each diviner trace. Oft o'er yon heav'ns when strays the poet's eye While soundless evening steals along the sky, That Afterward, to which no after comes, Seems to salute him from ideal homes, Which pale and pensive, from each pilgrim star Gleam through the air, and glisten from afar: And then, dear Lord! amid the vast and lone Faith can discern Thee on creation's throne. Thy solemn grandeurs, Thy nocturnal scenes,— How oft 'tween us and them there intervenes A troubled shadow, which our guilt must throw On all which manifests dread power below! But oh, amid the struggle, toil, and tears, And blighting anguish of our baffled years, The hush'd religion of a grief-worn heart How does it love Thee, Healer as Thou art! But when life's wearied days are spent and gone, And calm eternity is coming on, Ere the wing'd soul shall take its awful flight, Abide with us! and death will be delight. OUR MORROWS BELONG TO GOD. “Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”— Matt. vi. 34. Our morrows unto God belong; This day can be our own, If on the Stronger than the strong We lean our hearts alone, Casting on Christ our grief and care, By constant power of heaven-breathed prayer. But, Gentiles with a Christian name We gravitate to earth, And by our heathen darkness shame The glories of our birth; If sons who God their Father call,— To Him why trust not all in all? Oh, could we like the Saviour be, Whose “meat and drink” it made Heaven's will alone in life to see In all He did, or said! No longer would base Mammon find A temple in our care-worn mind. Behold! creation's world of sense Rebukes the carking race, Whose creedless hearts of Providence Discern no living trace, Though earth and sky and choral sea Are throbbing with divinity. The fowls which populate the air, The lilies of the field, Fed and adorn'd without a care, Divine instruction yield; They teach us what wise Nature can,— The arms of God environ man. And vain, too, each prophetic thought Whereby the fretted soul, With fever-visions overwrought, Man's future would control; Our being's age and body's growth,— The Lord alone predestines both. Why, for mere raiment, meat and drink, Our future so forecast, As though, like Pagans, we could think This life were first and last? Forgetful, that one thought sublime Outweighs a world of sense and time! Our little faith,—alas! 'tis less Than what the least should prove, Making our scene a wilderness Which might be one of love: Like orphan'd souls in solitude, Denying Him we call The Good. Gaze upward, soul! on God the true; Each burden cast on Him, Believe Jehovah cares for you Not less than seraphim: The very hairs of men are number'd, Why then with woes be overcumber'd? But still these boding hearts, like Seers On whom the future lowers, Project themselves o'er unborn years, And crowd the coming hours With destinies that haunt the mind, Till weaken'd faith grow wan and blind. Condemn'd be such unhallow'd care, Which lets to-morrow's weight O'erburden with a gaunt despair What cheers our present state; As if each day on life's dull road Were harness'd with too light a load! Sufficient for the Day when born Is each new pang that sighs; Let those who will not sink forlorn, In Jesu's name arise: Since ye belong to Heaven's control, Foreseen to-morrows! quit the soul. Simplicity is wisdom when Our yielding minds obey The law which God ordains for men,— Our duty is to-day! Our burden too, that cross to bear, And not forecast imagined care. And let thy teaching grace, oh Lord, Such perfect sway impart, That faith may hear this haunting word Like music in the heart,— Sufficient is the moment given, And thy to-morrow safe in heaven. SILENT PRAYER. “Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.”—1 Sam. i. 13. We do not pray, because we move Our lips in oral speech, For depths abound of deeper love Than words can ever reach. Nor is it prayer, when utter'd thought With ardent feeling glows, As though th' excited breast were fraught With flame that overflows: For words may flow from fluent powers, And prove a dubious sign; 'Tis only when the truth is ours, The heart, oh Lord, is Thine! The raptured tongue whose tones arise Like sparks of mental fire, Not ever breathes those contrite sighs Deep thoughts of sin inspire. And oft when o'er moved fancy rolls Soft melody of speech, No inward awe the mind controls With truths words cannot reach. True prayer is that mysterious breath The Spirit from above Breathes through the heart in life, and death, And is the pulse of Love! 'Tis God within, imparting grace, 'Tis heaven come down to earth, That man may look in Mercy's face, And feel his second birth; A sense of want, of woe, and sin, A creed that Christ is all, A faith whose filial voice within Can God “My Father!” call; Reliance on atoning Blood, Convictions true and deep, Attesting that the Lord is good Who bids us smile, or weep; With aspirations pure and high That souls, like saints, may be Both while we live, and when we die, From guilt and Satan free,— Behold a Prayer! a breath divine, Whose sacred throb and thrill, Believer, can that heart of thine With unvoiced worship fill. In such high mood of heavenliness, Upon thy spirit's chords Devotion feels a magic stress Beyond translating words: But He, benign Interpreter! Who hears an inward groan, In heaven perceives the voiceless stir Of souls He calls His own. Unbreathed, unspoke a prayer may be, Nor vocal lips proclaim What God alone can hear and see, When Love adores His name. Then, cheer thee! sad but sainted Heart That pines for spoken prayer; Be sure, if child of God thou art, More love than lips declare Dwells in thy depths of being still,— Howe'er some baffled word Break down beneath those thoughts which fill The soul where God is heard. And thus when dying voice decays, And pulse and motion cease, Heaven marks the speaking eye that prays For mercy's last release. True Christians live beyond their speech, And faith is more sublime Than syllables of breath can reach, Framed out of sense and time. MUSIC AND THE EVIL SPIRIT. “Seek out a man who is a cunning player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the Evil Spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.”—1 Sam. xvi. 16. Two worlds around us act and move, Though one alone we hear, or see; And they whose souls are born above, Will not repulse that Mystery Which binds them both by one harmonious law, Deeper than earth-framed science ever saw. The world of sense is fair to sight, Though touch'd all o'er with taints of sin; Gay morn, and noon, and magic night Accost the charmèd soul within, And, like faint beams on Memnon's fabled stone, Draw from our spirit some responsive tone. Mountain, and field, and forest wide With their green coronal of trees, And Ocean, with his billowy tide Rolling in wave-born ecstasies, Cities, and hamlets, and the high-wall'd town, And sculptured marbles, breathing dead renown,— In each and all there reigns and lives Far more than sensual eye beholds; A Presence which no token gives Of what the heart of things enfolds,— Save to deep Souls whose inward eye can see Symbols that charm the faithful, and the free. Another and a holier sphere, A viewless world, unheard, unknown, More awful than religion's fear, Around embodied minds is thrown; And while the earth-bound walk by sense and sight, That orb engirdles them by day and night! Angels, and Spirits of the blest, Stern Attributes, and sacred Powers Nature and Providence invest, And circle this vex'd life of ours;— While voiceless mysteries, whence we cannot tell, Throb through the flesh, did we but mark them well. And thou, deep charm of sevenfold grace, Sweet Music! Thou art more than sound; For melodies from God's bright place Within thy blissful spell abound, Like broken echoes, that have thus o'erran Angelic lyres, and trembled down to man! Oh! call not music by a word Terrestrial minds alone approve, For in it more than tone is heard,— A something deep as Spirits love; Painting, and poetry of sound are there, Blent with the lulling pause of secret prayer. Such was the minstrel's art divine When David struck his chorded lyre, Where earth and heaven in one combine, And by commingled sway inspire Soft airs, before whose superhuman spell The Fiend shrunk wither'd to his native hell! And He, the dread and dauntless seer, Whose word could seal and open skies, The awe of music did revere, And bow'd beneath those harmonies That gush'd around him, soft, serene, or grand, Like air-chords thrill'd by some celestial hand. MAKE THEE AN ARK. “Make thee an Ark ? Behold! I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth ? Come thou and all thy house into the Ark.”—Gen. vi. 14, 17; vii. 1. Though youth's bright world looks fresh and fair, And proud the pulse of feeling there, While syren hope sings everywhere Of promised bliss to come, Yet signs exist of sternest woe Which tell young Hearts that all below May yet the primal ruin show, And prove earth not our home! Deep, dark, and cold the cruel grave, When big and burning tear-drops lave The cheeks of Love, which mourns the brave And beautiful who fly! The bloom and breath of dawning Life Are each with slow consumption rife, And mark how soon the parting strife May close the sunken eye! Scarce dies a day, but rings the knell O'er something which we love too well, Or cherish with so close a spell That when it droops, we bleed; While pride and passion round us throng, And pleasures with voluptuous song Entice warm souls the way along Which ends in wrath decreed. Hence, life is peril; and how blest The minds that in some ark can rest, Secured and safe, howe'er distrest, From final wreck and woe! The storm may rise, the surges roll, Rude whirlwinds seem to rend the soul No mortal wisdom can control, Yet none that ark o'erthrow! “Make thee an Ark,” of old was heard; And, true as echo to the word, His heart with pure allegiance stirr'd The hand which Heaven obey'd: To Noah, God believed was law, O'erruling all he felt, or saw, With that serene and soothing awe Which keeps man undismay'd. And thus, when sea and sky were blent, While raged the roaring element Until each Vial's wrath was spent, Safe o'er the storm he rode; Around him cries and corpses were, And oft was yell'd man's howling praver, Mix'd with the wild beast's in his lair, When furious waves o'erflow'd. And so with saints of Light 'twill be, When taught, oh God! by grace and Thee, At once to that retreat they flee Where shelt'ring mercies bide; No ark they need to frame, or form, To shield them from each rushing storm Round life and death that spreads alarm,— For that Thy truth supplied. And dost thou seek, where stands the Ark, That, when wild tempests, stern and dark, Engulph and wreck each human bark, May waft thee safely on? Behold it, in the Church of grace, Prepared for each believing race Who there may find, with contrite face, The shelter Jesu won. Here babes, besprent with sacred dew Ere sin and sorrow yet they rue, Baptismally a nature new From God's own Spirit gain; On their white brows a mystic sign, Behold it tell this truth divine,— Yon infant, Christ! is sealed for Thine, Blood-wash'd from guilty stain. And onward as progressive life Encircles man with clashing strife, Howe'er the world with sin be rife, And dangers round us roll, Ark'd in Thy founded Church, O Lord! Thy promised Grace, Thy precious Word, If by our prostrate will preferr'd, Shall keep unwreck'd the soul. Safe in the Ark by Jesus built, Beyond the flooding waves of guilt We float, and, through the blood He spilt On Calvary's deathful tree,— Victoriously our spirits ride Over the sad and surging tide That welters o'er the world beside, Unanchor'd, God, in thee. And blest are they, with minds unskill'd By rebel pride to plan, or build An ark no present Christ hath fill'd With sacramental love; Who in the Church can sweetly rest, Till peace divine becalm their breast, And, howsoe'er by storms distress'd, A haven reach above. OH THAT I HAD WINGS! “I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.”—Ps. lv. 6. Bird of beauty! upward soaring On thy plumes of lustre white, Far beyond the tempest roaring And the gloom of gath'ring night, While they watch thee speed away Where no awful lightnings play, Many an earth-chain'd Heart will sigh, “Lend me wings, and let me fly!” “Dove-like let me, proudly rising Out of sin, and woe, and crime, Feel my wingèd soul despising Fetters wove from earth and time; And by faith ascend to see Shrines that glow with Deity, And in bowers of glory find Bliss of heart, and calm of mind.” Men, whose hearts by grace enlighten'd Once for heaven in concord beat, Have their taste by truth so heighten'd That no more in earth's retreat They contentment can perceive, But for ever pine to leave Scenes where passion's fires abound, And, like fiends, our faith surround. Not by creedless foe and stranger Are disciples wrong'd alone, But apostate friends endanger Those they once have loved, and known,— Who amid the morn of youth Both pursued and pray'd for truth, And along Time's ancient road, Calmly sought the house of God. Keen beyond all pangs distressing Is the piercing one that finds Friends of old in faith caressing, Chill'd in heart, and changed in mind; Each to each an alien grown, All fond smiles of welcome flown,— Heart-breathed wish and household word, Never more in union heard! Not again behold them taking Counsel sweet and sacred talk, But their holy Church forsaking For some wild sectarian walk:— Who can mark such sever'd friends When their love in loathing ends, Nor, like David, long to soar Where the saved are gone before? He whose heart true light discerneth In Thy beams, Incarnate Love: At Thy footstool deeply learneth Lessons that will last above; Nor amid such bleak distress, Sighs he for lone wilderness, But in prayer true solace finds, Opening heaven to sainted minds. Wearied, worn, and oft benighted, Want and weakness round us reign, Yet the Dove on Christ who lighted Thus prolongs that healing strain,— “Cast thy burden on My breast, Where the weary drop to rest; Harass'd pilgrim, hope and pray, Learn of Me, and love the way!” THE ARKLESS DOVE. “The dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark.”—Gen. viii. 9. The ghastliness and gloom of death Cover creation like a pall, Without a pulse, without a breath,— Sepulchral waters bury all; Like a huge corse the dead Earth lies A floating mass beneath the skies! It must have been a wild'ring sight Which roll'd his palsied heart-tide back, When Noah for the raven's flight Open'd the ark, and in yon track Where the wild deluge spread its wave Beheld but one stupendous grave! But, hark! a mild and gracious breeze Like a wing'd mercy floats along; The music of poetic trees Has never shed so sweet a song; For where its fresh enchantments play The floods decrease, and die away. The fountains of the Deep are closed, The windows shut of wrathful heaven, And, safe on Ararat reposed, The ark of life to Noah given; Judgment is o'er, and grace seems nigh, And green earth soon shall hail the sky. He sends the raven, and on wings Of fierce delight it hurries forth, Yet, ah! no olive-branch it brings, But east, and west, and south, and north, Flutters about by night and day, And banquets on vile carrion-prey. True emblem of those Belial hearts And canker'd minds, debased and dead, Who feed on what foul Earth imparts Of loathsome passion born, and bred; For, raven-like, they haunt the scene And revel most where vice hath been. But thou, sweet dove of radiant white! Methinks I watch thee in the beam Wave thy fair wings with free delight, And glisten in that snowy gleam Which round about thee glances mild, Decking thy plumage undefiled. Hither and thither wing'd the dove, And sought in vain some verdant tree; The waves beneath, the sky above Were all its vestal eyes could see; So, backward to the ark it flew And nestled in that shelter true. And, trace we not a symbol here Of that unrest the holy feel, When doom'd to haunt some alien sphere Where nothing reigns but carnal zeal; Where all looks selfish, low, and base, And time and sense our God displace? Oh! how they yearn for lone retreat, Some temple where religion dwells, While, sitting low at Jesu's feet, Their bosom with his doctrine swells; For Christ is their celestial Ark Which lifts them o'er life's ocean dark. Dovelike, amid the haunts of sin Howe'er the Saints are forced to roam, There is a pure unrest within That pants for some more perfect home; And that the Saviour's Church hath proved To God's elect, by angels loved. And e'en as once the dove brought back To Noah's hand, at twilight-hour, The branch of peace, that on its track Was pluck'd from some diluvian bower,— The soul of saints on earth may see Tokens of tender Deity: And as that bird, when once again The flooded soil began to rise, Till green apparel robed the plain And crystal sunlight clad the skies, No ark required, but in wide air Found a pure freedom ev'rywhere,— So, when this ruin'd earth recedes, Our perfect spirits will not ask A local church, where sorrow pleads For shelter from life's whelming task; Since heaven will prove one church of praise, And each true soul a temple raise. But ye unblest! of men deceived, Who think this world a good imparts Beyond what martyr'd saints believed, And welcomed in their wounded hearts, Of this be sure,—ye cannot find, From heaven apart, the peaceful mind! Go, child of Sin! pursue each path That opens on thy restless view; Prove all which gain, or glory, hath, Admire, enjoy, exhaust them too, But, still unreach'd is that repose That sainted virtue only knows! Ambition, pleasure, pride, or pelf, What gilded fame, or fortune gives, Feeds but the gnawing worm of Self Which on contentment preys and lives; Remote is that ideal rest Whose home becomes a hallow'd breast. Man was not made for finite good, The Infinite to Him pertains; Heaven's manna forms his genial food, Though unbelief from such refrains: O, that in Mercy's ark of peace The erring mind would seek release! Return unto thy rest, return Thou arkless soul of sinful man! For, until chaste affections burn With ardour pure as spirits can, Thy life will be a discontent, In fitful dreams of folly spent. Deep Spirit of divinest calm! Descend, and soothe unquiet hearts; Breathe o'er each ruffled mind the balm Thy perfect nobleness imparts, And then, oh Lord! Thy saints will be Sublimely ark'd in heaven and Thee. THE BOW OF PROMISE. “The bow shall be in the cloud; I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting Covenant.” Gen. ix. 16. Thou liquid bow of beauty and of grace Arching the rain-cloud with a bended way, Religion cannot mark thy gleaming trace And muse not, how the mighty God did say That when yon sacramental arch should span The hills beneath, or paint the heavens above, He would recall His covenant with Man, And feel the vastness of forgiving love. Summer, and seed-time, harvest, winter, spring, Whate'er the seasons in their mercy bear, Each unto ransom'd Earth should ever bring Tokens of peace and God's paternal care. And thus, a symbol art thou, and a sign Of what no wisdom in the schools could teach; A sacred emblem, preaching truths divine More eloquent of Christ than angel-speech. 'Tis not alone that Childhood's greeting eyes When first thine arching loveliness they see, Gladden beneath it with entranced surprise And hail the miracle of hues in thee! Nor is it, that our Priests of earth and heaven Who at the altar of the Muses stand, To whom the glorious privilege is given To summon beauty when they wave their wand, The gem-like radiance of thy form admire, And liquid blending of thy rain-born hues, Or, oft to hymn thee, strike the hallow'd lyre And into words thine opal gleams transfuse. Still less can Science, with her colder gaze, Suggest what thy prismatic splendours mean, When dim and delicate with tearful rays She marks thee outlined in the storm-veil'd scene. 'Tis Faith alone thy full enchantment feels Mild grace and glory of the firmament! When o'er the heart remember'd judgment steals, And grateful love with tender awe is blent. Since, not a pulse of life in earth, or sea, That should not in thy graceful symbol find A token which our God express'd by thee,— His curse has roll'd away from wreck'd mankind! Pure arch of triumph! wove through Nature's tears In fairy gems reflected as they fall, Bright may thy bow, beyond our mortal fears, Preach the vast mercy which encloseth all! And, deeply touching to the soul made wise Is the great truth primeval words declare,— That when a rainbow consecrates the skies Both God and man commingle glances there. Mercy The One in that soft omen sees, View'd in the promise which of old He swore, That earth should witness what His will decrees, And not be deluged as she was of yore. And man, the monument of matchless love, When he beholds yon bow of beauty form, Saint if he be, recalls the Christ above Who rescued Nature from her ruin-storm. But, high o'er heaven's purpureal ether mount To that sunn'd region where no storms prevail, And even there, at mercy's crystal fount The rainbow of our human past we hail! Round the white Throne where sits the Prince of Light,— Glory beyond all glories to express! Lo, the same rainbow gleams like emerald bright, And girdles Him with awful loveliness. And oh, believer! does not this declare That covenants divine abide the same? How saints of old, as living Christians are, Were rescued by the one redeeming Name? Lord of our souls! Thou Saviour ever dear, Be still our rainbow in the clouds of life; In Thy chaste sunlight melt each rising tear, And arch with triumph scenes of darkest strife. Radiant with mercy, calm the sinking heart, And beam through sorrow's night and suff'ring's gloom, A deathless Iris, that will ne'er depart, But shine immortal o'er our destined tomb! CHRIST IN COMMUNION WITH THE SOUL. “Abide with us.”—Luke xxiv. 29. Abide with us, dear Lord! abide; No hearts can beat, and be untried By pangful woe or care; But, if Thy shielding arm o'ershade The creature which Thy love hath made Hell cannot harm a hair. Around us Powers of evil throng Who fain would hurry souls along The wilds of sin and gloom; And principles within us rage In vernal youth, or wintry age, Which haunt us to the tomb. But Thou, abiding Lord of peace! Art light, and liberty's release To all meek sons of faith, Thy word divine who e'er attend, And listen to the sinner's Friend Though dark the truth He saith. The sinful Earth looks sad and lone, And guilty hearts around us moan, And graves, how fast they rise! As added years their record bring Of havoc, change, and suffering,— What sadness loads our sighs! But should Thy presence be supplied, What calming powers of truth abide! Our cross is meekly borne; Though spent the noon, and night appears To darken through our spirit's tears, Life will not be forlorn. When sickness shades the soul with dread, And Fever moans with throbbing head Till wild the pulses play, Abide with us! blest Lord, and be A balm beyond all sympathy To awe the Fiend away. Or, should it be our lot to keep Night-watch beside the guarded sleep Of parent, child, or friend, There, as we note each ebbing breath And scan the chill of coming death, Thy dews of mercy send. Or, when the churchyard-gloom we pace, And oft with tearful silence trace The tombs of friends no more, Abide with us! that Hope and Prayer May warble words of glory there, Which back the dead restore. But oh, blest Lord! of all the wounds With which man's wearied life abounds, Not death, nor sickness, they Which most disease the mind with pain, Or bid us view the world as vain, Where grief and anguish sway; But, hollow tongues and heartless smiles, And glozing friends who were but wiles Of falsehood lightly drest,— These melt us into more than tears, And make us feel our martyr'd years A burden on the breast. O then, abide with us! and calm Our spirit with that sacred balm Pure grace alone imparts; Thy Presence like a heaven will be, When all the false ones fade and flee, And soothe our sunken hearts. Abide with us!—why pray we so, As if disciples did not glow With Thine own promise sure? “Lo! I am with you, till the chime Of Ages sounds the last of time, While earth and man endure.” Yes, Thou art “with us” in Thy word; Thy Voice in sacraments is heard, And prayer and praise reveal How through the soul Thy blessings glide, As o'er the heart's most gloomy tide Thy radiant comforts steal. Dejection oft, but not despair, In this tried world of woe and care It may be ours to face; Only, be Thou the sleepless guide, Morn, noon, and night with us abide Till we complete our race. We ask not blissful calms to dwell Around us with unbroken spell, Nor seek a pangless lot; But, by the breathing of Thy word Be our faint bosoms freshly stirr'd, Nor sigh, as if forgot! DEPARTED, NOT DEAD. [C. H. E. M., BORN MAY 4, 1848: DIED JUNE 8, 1848.] “As one in bitterness for his first-born.”—Zech. xii. 10. “Redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb.”—Rev. xiv. 4. Thou art not dead, my vanish'd one! But living in the light Of some pure world, beyond the sun, Where death creates no night, And sumless babes are smiling now As bright and beautiful as thou. When first I saw thy baby-form With eyes of tearful love, I little thought a hidden storm Was looming from above, So soon to blast my May-born flower Beneath the blight of deathful power. The Lord who gives, hath ta'en away, And blest be His high name! Oh, that with calm I this could say And feel God's hallow'd claim:— Cease, rebel heart! be calm and still, And bow beneath a Father's will. Pale relic! now enrobed for death, Nurseling of hopes and fears, How did I watch each ebbing breath And kiss thine infant tears, When throbs of suff'ring o'er thee came Thy wordless tongue could never name. Departed babe! how many a dream Brighten'd thy father's heart, When like a vision thou didst seem In life to take such part, That o'er his hours there breathed a spell More exquisite than tones can tell. With thy soft features round me glowing Amid the world I went, And with a heart to heaven o'erflowing Bless'd thee, bright innocent! And felt, howe'er my path should roam, My little star-beam reign'd at home. Already Hope's prophetic eye Beheld some future spot, And underneath life's vernal sky, Pictured thy maiden lot, Where truth and grace would be thy guide, And all thy wants by heaven supplied. I dream'd, if God thy life should spare, How blessèd it would be To hear thy budding lips declare Young words of Deity; To watch thy spirit, day by day, Rise into speech, and learn to pray. I fancied how my hand would lead Thy tiny feet along, By placid shore, or sunny mead Where brooklets sing their song, While gay-wing'd breezes round thee flew And clad thy cheeks with vermeil hue. And oh! I dared, through Him, to hope, To Whose baptismal arms I gave thee,—that thy mind would ope Each year, with sacred charms; As more and more The Spirit taught Thy gentle soul what Jesu wrought. But thou art pale, a perish'd flower, A blossom on Life's tree, Nipp'd in the bud, before the power Of sin corrupted thee:— Wash'd in the blood of Jesu white, Babe, art not thou in glory bright? Cold, cold, my child! I view thee now Like Sleep in marble lying, With paleness on thy placid brow Which sets my heart a-sighing; And round thy lips there linger still Dead smiles that shall remembrance fill. My first-born! God has call'd thee back, His gift He doth resume, But o'er thy father's blighted track Darkens thine early tomb,— A haunting shade of more than grief To which man's world brings no relief. From room to room I wander on Where thou hast been of yore, And all mine eyes can gaze upon Recalls a child no more; As though each object would declare Thy darling glances rested there. Beloved and beauteous wreck of all That warm'd this aching breast With hopes, that when the funeral pall Should o'er thy parent rest, There still might be a loving one To think of him, whose course was run,— Farewell! farewell! departed child, Sweet darling of the soul, Gone to the grave, ere sin defiled Thy conscience with control; I mourn, my babe! but not for thee Becalm'd in Christ's eternity. Before me lies a perill'd way Of trial, change, and tears; If short or long, life's future day, Rests with the God of years, Who measures our appointed span, And deals the thread of time to man. Yet I shall smile, and act, and speak, As though thou ne'er hadst been; And they who scan the brow and cheek And judge by outward mien, Can little dream how much we hide Under the heart's unwitness'd tide! The purest thoughts lone spirits bear Are marr'd by being spoken, And more than deepest words declare Lives in some heart half-broken; A transient grief light tongues may tell, But cloister'd Anguish keeps her cell. A thousand things must wake the sigh That shall remember thee, And raise before the mental eye Those tombs of memory, Which o'er the churchyard of the heart Cast inward shades, which ne'er depart. The beam, the bud, the blooming grace Of some infantile flower Which smiles into a poet's face In Nature's conscious hour, Oh! each and all will oft restore, A mental gleam of her no more. But melody, beyond all charms, The buried past regains; And oft the spoiling tomb disarms By resurrection-strains, In whose rapt tones the dead revive, And untomb'd years appear alive. Thus will thy sylph-like features float Before mine inward gaze, Call'd into life by some sweet note The harp of feeling plays; Across my soul thy shape will beam, And smile like some incarnate dream. Farewell, my child! but not farewell For ever;—we shall meet When sounds creation's dooming knell Before the judgment-seat; And I shall know thy little face Amid the world's assembled race. Thrice happy babe! thou beauteous Soul To some bright world ascended, How glorious that celestial goal Where thy brief course is ended!— And most divine that hour will be That bids me mount, and follow thee. June 8th, 1848. PREVAILING INTERCESSION. “I will speak, yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake,”(Gen. xviii. 32,) compared with, “Ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.”—Jer. xxix. 12. Thou dost, O God! transcend the All Creative thought can into vision call, When most enrapt and raisèd Mind Darts through the regions of the undefined, Conceiving there the beautiful and bright In the deep centre of Ideal light; Eternal! Thou art perfect good,— Such glory, who but Thou, hast understood? And yet, may soul-breathed prayer ascend And with those anthems of Thy worship blend, Which round that secret Glory dwell Where Thou art shrined in shades invisible: Not dearer to Thine ear of love The hymns and hallelujahs heard above, Than is the contrite sinner's cry, The broken cadence of his burden'd sigh. O mystery! fathomless to thought, With truths august how infinitely fraught! That He, The Essence Uncreate Throned in the blaze of His almighty state, Should bend to hear the falt'ring praise We sinful earth-worms to the Godhead raise, And so in Christ should condescend To call the Dust of woman born, His “Friend!” Hence, prayer becomes a pious wing By which we soar to where crown'd Angels sing, Ensphered in realms surmounting time.— Through the dread vastness of the heavens sublime Souls cleave their flight, until they see The mercy-shrine of prayer-moved Deity; There, entering in behind the veil, Our suppliant hearts may breathe their sorrowing tale. And, what a privilege for those Foundlings of grace, o'erwhelm'd by frequent woes, Whose faith-wing'd souls with seraph-zeal Rise to That Heart in heaven, which learn'd to feel In this rude world where sorrows reign, The direst throbbing of terrestrial pain!— Who, though on high He weeps no more, In bliss remembers what on earth He bore. Yes! Sympathy beyond the skies Reigns, feels and acts for souls renew'd, which rise And with adoring boldness ask Due strength to aid them in life's weary task: There Christ, our elder Brother, lives, And echoes back whate'er the suppliant gives Of low-breathed sigh, or sorrow's tone, As though the Church's trial were His own. Hence meekly wise, the heaven-taught Mind By prayerless reason grows not base and blind; For God is honour'd when we pray: In the rich glories of their guardian sway His Attributes we then confess, Alone can blast us, or supremely bless; A sigh, or look, or breath of prayer Brings Heaven to earth, and proves God ev'ry where. Arm'd with the strength true prayer bestows, How fearless martyrs triumph'd o'er their woes! The sworded despot, fire and chain, The dungeon-midnight, and the exile's pain, With all tyrannic horrors press'd Through the deep gloom of some o'ertortured breast,— Melted, like shades, before the sense That prayer on earth was man's omnipotence. Devotion guides the soul to God By the same pathway blest Emmanuel trod; Its power may range all nature through, And in the dark of providence can view Soft tokens of celestial light, Calm spots of glory, which allay the night; And grasp, while griefs around them stand, The feeling guidance of their Father's hand. Who lives on this lone earth of graves, Will find bare wisdom nought from ruin saves: Sorrow and sin encompass all Which men of flesh their finest rapture call, Without,—delusive spells abound, And Fiends unview'd our holiest shrines surround; Within,—behold the traitor's will! With some dark lust that dares besiege us still. In vain will unanointed eyes Seek for a halcyon bower below the skies: Gay inexperience soon will find The ruin'd conscience, and the restless mind, And marvel, as swift years advance, How many a tombstone hails its tearful glance; While busy Homes, once bright with glee, Th' eclipsing shadow of their dead will see! More blest are they, whom Christ hath taught To seek that Home true saints have ever sought, E'en that pure orb of perfect rest Where sin nor sorrow clouds the aching breast:— And, who are these, but men of prayer Who unto God committed grief and care, And on the heart of Jesu laid Each burden down, which lighten'd as they pray'd? They knew, that saints alone are strong, Who mourn what weakness must to saints belong, And to the last corruption feel Like a slow plague-spot o'er sick nature steal: Their wisdom was themselves to know, Whose guiding law was God revered below; Their lives were liturgies of love, And Christ the loadstar they obey'd above. And so with us 'twill ever be, If true to heaven our hearts beat loyally. What souls to living bodies are, To faith heaven-born becomes the pulse of Prayer,— The spirit's life that throbs within, And gently masters each embosom'd sin, Reigning victorious over all Which back to earth the mounting soul would call. True prayer is thus Religion's breath, That hallows life, and haunts her until death; Without it, holiness expires, Dark grow our hopes, and sensual our desires;— Since, not a grace the Gospel gives But in the power of prayer it moves, and lives, And Christ His perfect image sees, When He beholds him on adoring knees. LIFE IS A FADING LEAF. “We all do fade as a leaf.”—Isa. lxiv. 6. Chill o'er yon heath autumnal shadows fall, The dusky twilight reigns with deeper sway, While soft dejection seems to mantle all, Like nature mourning for the death of day. As hectic hues on pale consumption's form, Red tints of ruin deck the flower and tree, And low winds murmur like a wailing storm, Or dirges o'er the dead entomb'd at sea. Where is the flush, by vernal radiance clad, That late o'er all the glowing landscape smiled, Making the heart of hoary age as glad As though 'twere backward into youth beguiled? 'Tis gone, that bright and beauteous glow, Which o'er the teeming breast of nature threw A charm that bad the bleakest mind o'erflow With feelings exquisite, and fancies new. There is a deadness, clothed by wintry awe, Encircling now what then with bloom was bright; And where the freshness of young spring we saw, Floats the chill moisture of the coming blight. Here as we roam adown yon woodland-dell, The stricken leaves in yellow showers descend, And each one seems to sigh a sad farewell, Like love-tones murmur'd o'er a dying friend. Meet emblem this of transient life's decay, How all things perish which we prize below; Where, like sear'd foliage, youth soon fades away, And wither'd hopes bestrew the path of woe. We learn mortality where'er we look, The dust we tread subserves a moral plan, And when aright we read creation's book, Lo! all its pages are address'd to man. Summer and winter, autumn and mild spring, May each instruct us by their beauteous lore; Each to our soul a sacred lesson bring, And buried warnings into life restore. In some high mood of melancholy thought Nature herself doth almost human grow, And mirror back what Mind to her hath brought, And leave men wiser than mere sages know. And well it tempers with a sober hue The gayest scenes that youthful passions find, To cast o'er coming death a pensive view, And breathe the quiet of a prayerful mind. Dejection makes the autumn of the soul,— But let autumnal feelings have their sway, And, shrink not, Christian! from their just control, But grasp their blessing, ere they glide away. Yet may not wintry skies, nor leafless bower Oppress the spirit with too damp a gloom; For in man's being lurks a vital power, By Christ obtain'd, victorious o'er the tomb. Thus, though man wither like an orphan leaf Which lies forgotten in the lonely dust, His dead corruption is a moment brief,— For, hark the trumpet! and arise he must. 'Tis here the parable of nature's death Fails to adumbrate what our doom shall be; Life does not perish with corporeal breath, But live once more to look on Deity! Earth, air, and ocean, wood and wildest shore,— Sleep in the dust where mortal embers may, When rings the trumpet, each shall back restore The deathless atoms of departed clay. Creation finds an everlasting grave; Where fall the dead leaves, they for ever lie, No resurrection-winds shall o'er them wave, And show their beauty to a new-born sky: But, Man shall triumph o'er an endless tomb; When God's loud clarion wakes his sleeping frame, A dread eternity must be his doom, In heaven immortal, or in hell, the same! A FOUNTAIN IN THE DESERT. “God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.” Gen. xxii. 19. Under the burning eye of heaven Breathless and bright as noon can be, Mother and child,—behold them driven O'er the hot wild in agony; While each heart throbs that fearful prayer, “Relieve me, Death! from black despair.” Beersheba's desert, lone and dun, Around them both lies grimly spread; No veiling cloud-shade hides the sun, And underneath, as on they tread, The fierceness of its flaming heat Doth blister their unsandall'd feet. O, for the music of one breeze To warble through the windless air! Or, cooling breath from some chance trees To mitigate the savage glare, Which reddens like a furnace-glow O'er sky and herbless soil below. But still untamed, the eastern noon Burns round them in a breezeless trance; And, yellower than the harvest-moon Yon wither'd heath which meets their glance; Above, below, where'er they gaze, 'Tis cruel heat, and cloudless blaze! No bird-wings break the hush intense, No murmurs fall from leafy bough; The very insects in suspense Refrain their tiny descant now: So dead the stillness reigning round A man might hear his heart-beat sound. Yon haggard mother lifts her eyes, Around the scene they wildly roll, And who can list the choking sighs Which heave from out her riven soul, And not believe, intenser pain Could never cleave a heart in twain! Foodless and fainting lags her child, Its bleeding feet can hardly stand; Yet, fired with thirst, along the wild She guides it with a fev'rish hand:— The water spent, along her frame The shudderings deep of horror came! In vain her sunken eyes survey'd The arid heath and desert bare, To see if one lone streamlet stray'd In flow of mercy lingering there; For neither gushing well, nor brook Replied to her despairing look. Oh, sad Egyptian! outcast one, By Sarah hurl'd from all thy bliss, Ten thousand deaths have now begun To mingle in a death like this; Methinks I mark thee, Hagar wild, Shudder to view thy sobbing child! Fainter and fainter moves each limb, The parchèd mouth no more can speak; And when thy tears descend on him, They burn upon his hollow cheek; The swoon of death is coming fast,— The child beneath yon shrub is cast. Parental Love! 'tis now the hour To testify how deep thou art; Replete with superhuman power, Thy fountain is a mother's heart: Though fathom'd seas their depths unfold, The deeps of love what tongue hath told? From God a mother's feelings rise, A fount divine is their high source, And, purer than our thoughts surmise, They stream through life their endless course; Outlasting all we love to see,— They blend with soul's eternity! And this was hers, who could not dare Behold her gasping child depart, But laid him down in mute despair, Then turn'd her eyes, but not her heart From that dread sight:—behind a tree She shrunk, and wept, how bitterly! And as she wail'd, what sobs and sighs Along her quivering heart-strings came! While closed her boy his fainting eyes, And scorching thirst subdued his frame: She dared not see, but how she felt His throbs of anguish through her melt! But God is nigh, oh, mother wild! Behold a mission'd angel's wings Arch their rich glory o'er the child, And, hark! the mercy that he brings,— “Hagar arise, God hears thy prayer, Go, drink yon well which warbles there.” Her eyes were open'd; from the ground She saw the crystal water rise, And then, as though from death unbound, Outburst a mother's ecstasies!— She gave her child that cooling stream, And stood entranced, as in a dream. And God be thank'd! for this deep tale Where grief and grace so finely blend; And ne'er may such high story fail Our own chill'd hearts to warm, and mend; For much it holds, if right we read, To soothe us in dejection's need. Not from the bond-maid are we born, But children of the Church, and free; Yet, oft vex'd life appears forlorn As though forgot by Deity; Cains of the heart, we rove accurst Till life becomes one aching thirst. But in the gloom of this rack'd hour When all around looks bleak and bare, Betake thee to yon gracious Power Who listen'd to the weeping prayer Lone Hagar lifted in the wild, And brought down Godhead to her child. For, have we not a Living Well Of consolations deep as pure? Nor are its waves invisible If love and faith our hearts assure; Since Christ is our celestial Spring, Whom prayer to earth can ever bring. And minor wells from Him may flow Of comfort, joy, and heaven-like peace, Which calm the fever'd heart of woe, And grant the mind a fresh release; And such are found in His blest Word When God by faith is seen, and heard. There crystal wells of grace abound,— The promises, which man console, And cool life's arid desert round With streams that freshen as they roll; And seraph heart and saintly mind Can ever such refreshment find. Thou Light of reason! Lord of grace, Heaven's Paraclete, by Christ obtain'd, Descend, and from our souls displace Whatever throne the world hath gain'd; Dark eyes unscale, and let them see Our everlasting Well in Thee! MEDITATION AT EVENTIDE. “Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide.” Gen. xxiv. 63. I love the still romance of lonely fields, When shading twilight like a Spirit-wing Broods o'er the landscape, and the air-tone yields To the charm'd mind a pensive murmuring. There, unbeheld by man's intrusive eye, Let the lone pilgrim wind some willow'd path, And in the silence of the years gone by, Feel the soft bliss a sacred memory hath. When the rude passion of the roaring winds Louder and louder swells along the sea, Their voice is echo'd by tempestuous Minds Who love reflections of themselves to see: Or, climb some rock where cloud-born anthems peal And hymning thunders all around thee roll, And, throned in darkness, thou may'st learn to feel The dread foundations of the human soul. But, wisdom most with tenderness doth dwell; And silent eve, and solitary spot, Will clothe remembrance with a lasting spell When stern magnificence is all forgot. So have they felt, who roam'd thy realm sublime, Heroic fatherland of Tell the free!— Helvetia, while they trod that haunted clime, And drank the magic which inspireth thee. There the huge mountains lift their billowy forms, And glaciers whiten by the gorge's steep, O'er rocks of icy gloom resound the storms, And pine-trees rend, as on the whirlwind sweep: And I have heard the Alpine thunder groan Blent with the avalanche's crushing roar, As though the Lord of nature left His throne For chaos to resume its reign once more. Darkness, and thunder, crag, ravine, and rock, And precipice that strikes the pilgrim chill, Send to the o'erawed mind a secret shock And with terrific glories mem'ry fill. But, oh! how often when the stern and wild Die into sadness, like a tragic dream, The loved impressions of some landscape mild In fresh reality still glow, and gleam. The lyric cadence of each choral breeze Mix'd with the tinkling cow-bells' pensive tone, The grazing herd, the chalets bower'd in trees, And mellow calm upon the mountains thrown, With deep-valed haunts, whose matchless beauty made The heart o'erflow with loveliness profound, While pine-woods round the curving shores display'd Their forest-grace with leafy grandeur crown'd,— Say, have not these beyond dread storms impress'd On pure remembrance what the past hath been, And left a magic that serenes the breast Like thy hush'd vale, thou unforgot Orsine? 'Tis thus, the calm of beauty most appeals To finer moods when sainted feeling reigns, Which downward to the root of mem'ry steals, And all the softness of our spirit gains. And oft when ruder life with stormful grief Rocks the torn heart, till inward tempests rise, Ideal landscapes lend a soft relief And smile upon us, like subduing eyes! So felt the patriarch, when he wisely chose The lulling hour of loneliness and shade, To drink the freshness of that pure repose A quiet evening round the meadows made. He went to meditate, to muse, and dream, Where nought broke stillness but the vesper song Of some gay insect, bird, or babbling stream Which feels half conscious as it flows along. Perchance, he mused on nature, man, and God, Creation's wreck, and ruin'd innocence, On fortune's sunshine, or affliction's rod, And all which Grace and Goodness here dispense. Floated the hymns of angels on his ear, As once they warbled over Eden's bower? Or, did he vision, through a rising tear, The star maternal of his childish hour? Time has not told: but yet, like him, we may Wander at eve to meditate and muse, Far from the hum of crowds and cities stray, And nature's quiet o'er the heart suffuse. They cannot nurse nobility within Who ne'er the solitudes of nature thread, And, far removed from man's tumultuous din, Recall the vanish'd, and revive the dead. There is a wisdom in the wood and field, A sacred meaning in the silent flower, And shrines of loneliness instruction yield, Did we but haunt them in a genial hour. Cities of men and mortal baseness preach; But sylvan dales, like holy things, impart A healing quiet, which may conscience reach, And bring God closer to an alien heart. The open vastness of yon vaulted sky When o'er our heads we view its arching sweep,— There should we learn to lift a thoughtful eye, And muse on mercy, till remembrance weep. And thus, disciple of that Lonely One! Who through the night-watch often wept, and pray'd, Do thou, like Isaac, when the day is done, With God converse, and seek Him in the shade. There will Emmanuel to thy soul draw near And bid thee more for saving glories yearn, As on “the way” He soothed disciples' fear, And reason'd with them, till their hearts did burn! One pensive hour with nature, God, and prayer, While the dusk Evening wraps her dewy veil, Cools the hot fever on each brow of care, And cheers the soul when brighter prospects fail. There, in that hush of meditation lone, The still small accents of the Spirit speak Truths, in the whirl of life how rarely known, And by dead conscience heard, as dull and weak! Believer, thus to silence yield the soul, Be thy calm mind to musing loneness given, Till secret earth-clouds from thy vision roll And show thee glimpses of a Saviour's heaven. MORAL POWER OF HARMONY. “The rest were chosen to give thanks unto the Lord ? with musical instruments of God.”—1 Chron. xvi. 41, 42. I love to hear the wizard tones Of thunder, storm, and booming sea, The wave-voiced winds, and tragic groans Which make creation's minstrelsy,— When Art and Genius such a triumph gain That all seem blended in some master-strain. And Harmony can also bring What mental visions love to view, Pictures, beyond what poets sing, When most they make the world untrue,— Landscapes of beauty, isles of bloom and balm, Elysian verdure, and ambrosial calm. But, Music wields a nobler spell Than nature can alone impart; And with far more than tones can tell She oft inspires the echoing heart: To her belongs Association's power, Which haunts remembrance in its purest hour. Melodious counterparts of mind How often do some chords impress, When Genius, with a hand refined, Creates the sounds we inly bless!— All passions, hopes, all principles and fears Melt into music, and entrance our ears. Thus, harmony to man may seem A soul in sound, express'd and heard, Or like an Angel in our dream Who whispers some celestial word, Till minds o'erfraught with feeling's warmest glow Thrill into tears, and softly overflow. And oh, ye dead! who never die,— For though removed from outward gaze, Your resurrection is the sigh Pure memory unto virtue pays,— Though unbeheld, how oft in music's strain Your deep eyes look into our hearts again! Yes, chords are touch'd, whose tones awake And strike the soul's electric string, Which vibrates till it seems to break With those intense appeals that bring Youth, home and childhood, fields, and faces dear Back to the Heart, which bathes them with a tear. Thus music, like religion, oft May elevate the heaven-wing'd mind, By wafting it to worlds aloft For peace and purity design'd: 'Tis inspiration, though mere sound it seems, Prompting the good to more than Glory dreams. We praise Thee, God! for this fine spell Pervading harmony can wield: But, teach us to employ it well, That it may grace and grandeur yield, Whether by organ-chant, or choral hymn Which rolls and deepens down cathedrals dim. And when congenial hearts delight In homes of quiet bliss to hear Soft household-strains, which make the night To memory as to music dear, Like silver drops of some melodious shower Heard in the dewy hush of twilight hour,— Music seems more than common air Through chorded instrument awaking, And oft resembles dying prayer, Or sighs from lonely hearts half-breaking: Thus none can dream whence harmonies descend, Or how their spirit with our own can blend. Hence music proves a sacred thing, A power no mortal words can tell; A heaven of sound it seems to bring On earth awhile to float and dwell,— A breaking forth of melodies above, A speech of seraphim, on lips of Love! And oft, methinks, the tones which die And soundless grow to mortal ear, May re-ascend their mystic Sky, From whence they sank to our low sphere,— Like that bright Choir who soar'd from Judah's plain, To chant in heaven what earth ne'er heard again. THE REDEEMER'S SIGH. “And looking up to Heaven, He sighed.” Mark vii. 34. And did The gentle Saviour sigh, As once He wept a tear, When sorrow dimm'd His mournful eye Drawn from a mortal sphere? Then let the Church this breathing sign Of Christ's unutter'd thought, With all that spoken love combine With which each word was fraught. For, oh, it proves a symbol deep Beyond what language tells When most true Pathos bids us weep Beneath her moving spells— How Christ in sorrow, pangs, and tears, Though social, stood alone, Since while He wept for others' fears, He chiefly sigh'd His own. And in that hour, when doing good, While making dumbness speak, Dark meanings fill'd His solitude, And shaded brow and cheek. When sinful men a boon bestow, Bright gladness marks the hour; They do not sigh, but only glow To feel their gracious power; But such the cup of anguish quaff'd Emmanuel in His gloom,— He wept and sigh'd, but never laugh'd, From manger to the tomb! His life was one celestial pain, A martyrdom of care; Denial had its perfect reign In each perfection there. Through all some crucifixion ran, The Cross became His will, Where God beheld a faultless man, And cries, “Behold him!” still. MAN'S HEART, DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS. “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart.”—Jer. xvii. 9, 10. As Christ was God in flesh array'd, So God in language is that Word Where man is inwardly portray'd, As though his copied heart were heard. For not a single throb of thought Vibrates within his viewless mind, That is not to conviction brought By heaven's dread Book, which reads mankind! And is not this a crushing tone, An avalanche of stern rebuke, A thunder-peal from His high throne Before whose glance Creation shook,— That Man becomes incarnate lie, A living mass of low deceit, Baffling the search of mortal eye To scan the guiles which in him meet? Beyond all creatures, and above What sin and Satan can unfold, The venom'd coil around him wove,— The serpent-depths no tongue has told! And desperate too, if finite cure Be all our hopes pretend to find, Those fell deceits which men allure And leave the conscience dead and blind. We grant there are distinctions true Between degrees of social worth; For, some are tender, warm, and true, And others, iced as frozen earth: And some we hail, whose hearts expand Like bounding waves beneath the sun; While these, with shut and selfish hand A vile career of passion run. Gradations thus 'tween man and man When measured by our moral test, Are undenied; and reason can Perceive them in the human breast. But still, if heavenward we ascend, And by the law of love divine Discern how far our natures tend, Apart from Thee, oh God! and Thine, Then, hear a thunder-peal like this From out the clouds of Scripture roll,— “Deceitful and most desperate is The life of unconverted soul!” And can we dare this truth deny, How nature marks her hate with smiles, And loves the most enamell'd lie Which polishes her venal wiles? And if, alas! ourselves we scan, Deceitful prove we, to the core! The child doth prophesy the man, The man repeats the child before: All, all, in youth, and age alike, Abroad, at home, for word or thought The bosom may with anguish strike, And be with full contrition fraught, If but an hour we search, and see What broken vows condemn our ways, How fairest resolutions flee, And we are charm'd by cheating praise! The very sins men weep at morn And at the mercy-seat confess, Again before the night, are born, And stain them with new loathsomeness! Well may we hang the head, and mourn, Nor doubt that piercing Word is true Which saith, no Hearts to heaven return Except by mercy, born anew. Faith heeds not how false worldlings smile; God's truth can ne'er be sneer'd away; The heart is one abyss of guile Whose throbs, like Judas, Christ betray. And in us all by nature lurk The germs of unimagined crime, Which often dares the Demon's work And crimsons o'er the cheek of Time. Yes, Adam, Cain, and Peter's lie, Herod and David in their sin,— Let candour search, and so descry Their secret prototypes within. Come, Holy Spirit! mystic Dove, Thine innocence from heaven impart; Our hate transform to heavenly love, And build Thy temple in our heart. The purest soul pleased Earth admires, Who to the centre scans it all? The highest Angel back retires, And prostrate worlds in silence fall. Who knows it? Echo answers, “Who?” Created minds are bow'd and dumb:— “Jehovah, I can search it through, And enter where no creatures come.” Tremendous thought! that God and man By contrast both should searchless be; The last too vile for thought to scan, The First, unfathom'd Deity! EXPRESSIVE NIGHT. “Night unto night showeth knowledge.”—Ps. xix. 2. “Even the night shall be light about me.”—Ps. cxxxix. 11. Shades of the soft and stealing night! More eloquent than joyous light Is your dark magic, deep and still Descending over bower and hill. There is a hush, a holy spell Breathed o'er dim earth by day's farewell; A calm more chaste than words define, A feeling that is half divine. I love to watch the quiv'ring gleams Of twilight, when they braid the streams, Or with slant radiance hue the flowers, Which close their lids in garden-bowers. Now, cold and mute Creation grows, As drops her curtain of repose; The birds are songless, and the air Seems hallow'd into silent prayer. Like Music's death, serene and slow, Pale twilight yields a pensive glow, And soon will turret, tree, and spire, All viewless into gloom retire. Now is the witching time for thought, Th' elect of heaven have ever sought; By patriarch, saint, and poet found With high-breathed instincts to abound. Angelic choirs may now descend And with our souls serenely blend, Hover around where'er we stray, And thrill, when Thought begins to pray. Thus, when the fev'rish day was o'er, Rapt Jesu sought the quiet shore; Or, on loved Hermon, lone and still, Breathed, “Oh, my Father! do Thy will.” So, Christian, while the prayerless throng Whirl time away in feast and song, Be thine the pure and placid spell Which night and nature weave so well. Creation, providence, and grace, Let each assume its hallow'd place In thought serene,—by Heaven bestow'd On all who trace the narrow road. Night is the time when buried days Rise from their tomb, and dim our gaze With tearful shades, from scenes of yore, And loving hearts which throb no more. So rules the Past, that faint and far As fancy eyes each vestal star, Young poets dream how there abide The deathless ones, on earth who died. Night for the present, too, creates A charm which oft the mind elates,— A lone, but still a lofty dream That men are more than yet they seem. And on thy future let such hour Look like a prophet in his power, Predicting much that God and grace Reveal to guide our erring race. Nor be forgot, in heaven Thou art A Priest, oh Christ! whose boundless heart Thrills to each cry, which all may dare To utter forth in fervid prayer. Now in the hush of holy night Claim we, blest Lord! the glorious right Before Thy Throne of grace to bring All forms of human suffering:— A Husband to the widow be; A Sire may orphans find in Thee; And to Thy sad and stricken poor Let heaven unfold its waiting door; And where dejected hearts incline To question, Lord, the Will divine, The Blood of sprinkling let it fall, And while it cleanses, calm them all. For church, for country, and for child, A mother dear, or sister mild, For all true souls and social ties Now let entreating prayer arise. And, cradled on maternal breast, May each sweet babe in slumber rest, And round pale captives in their cells Hover dear homes, and native dells. Morn, noon, and night, O God! are Thine, In whom their blended charms combine; Nor is there scene, or spot, or hour Untouch'd by Thy mysterious power. Yet, faith and feeling both declare That hour belongs to Thee and prayer, When stillness to the soul is given,— For night, not day, seems nearest heaven. THE PRAYERLESS. “Thou restrainest prayer before God.”—Job xv. 4. “If thou knewest the gift of God ? thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.”—John iv. 10. “My heart is cold, I cannot pray,” Methinks I hear the worldling say;— But is not this blind nature's sin? Thou graceless outcast! lift thine eyes To where man's home of glory lies, And thou may'st hear the God within. Did we but fathom more and more Our inward deeps, we should deplore Those unborn sins which there abide: With truthful anguish might we plead For God to help our sinful need, And cast us on The Crucified! Who does not pray, our God unthrones, His word rejects, His will disowns, Till life becomes one guilty sigh; Pure Reason from her shrine is hurl'd, And earth appears an orphan'd world, Whose Maker is no more on high. O, creed of death! and cold despair, Which thus repels the power of prayer, By peerless saints and martyrs loved; Since faith and reason both unite To vindicate God's awful right, By prayer to have His throne approved. The very Power to whom we pray Is He who prompteth what to say,— 'Tis spirit, more than spoken word; For thought is speech, and heard on high The sadness of some low-breathed sigh, When penitence by love is stirr'd. Alas! for thee, thou prayerless one, Thy living hell is now begun In passion blind, and base desire; The torment of apostate will Must ever make thy chosen ill, And fill thee with perdition's fire. Could vain men see how vile they are, Sublime would beat the pulse of prayer In temple, home, or twilight-field; Believing thus with loving thought What strength to Christ Himself it brought,— Pure bliss would high devotion yield. But, dost thou mourn thy heart is cold, And rev'rence truth divinely bold? Then, undevout one, here it lies,— Th' unfeeling soul, and faithless mind, Oh, these are they which render blind When upward gaze thy restless eyes. This world is far too closely coil'd Around a heart by pleasure soil'd, Where sin, desire, and Satan dwell; Ambition's guilt and lust of gain Within thee hold infernal reign, And triumph with a wizard spell. But wouldst thou taste the bliss of prayer, Breathing on earth celestial air? Then, burst thy Belial chains away! Each wand'ring thought to God call home, And ponder on the world to-come Till conscience prompt thee how to pray. Go, learn it of that martyr'd host Who bled for Christ, and pray'd the most Because they loved Him unto death; Hark! how their wingèd raptures rise, And catch the lustre of their eyes Who praised Him with departing breath. Or, rather That pure Spirit seek, Whose love can so uplift the weak When dull they seem, and dead they grow, Till oft with mental groans unheard Their souls by unbreathed prayer are stirr'd, And with devotion overflow. Incarnate God! while here we live, Be this our prayer, “Forgive! forgive!”— But, who can fathom all we mean? Eternity itself will prove A paraphrase of pardoning love, And teach Heaven what the Cross hath been! DREAD SACRIFICE. “Take now thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and offer him for a burnt-offering.”— Gen. xxii. 2. And must a father slay his only child? Dark thought in which ten thousand deaths abide! Was ever parent with such blood defiled, Or such a victim to a God supplied? And Isaac too! the promised heir of age, The child of covenant, by heaven bestow'd To cheer the sire in his sad pilgrimage, At whose glad birth his full heart overflow'd.— 'Tis thus, whate'er in living depths of love Haunts the pure heart, parental as profound, Might well have shudder'd at the Voice above, “Let Isaac for my human lamb be bound!” If dies the son, then how shall Abram's seed Inherit Canaan's heaven-distinguish'd land? Or, if the child must by the parent bleed, How can the covenant in Isaac stand? Reason and conscience, shall they both arise, And shrinking heart-blood grow with terror pale When looks the patriarch in loved Sara's eyes, And on his lip expires the awful tale? The savage heathen, will they not abhor A God of blood, and call the deed profane Beyond the fury of the fiercest war, That strews a battle-field with tombless slain? And thus, if nature be the only guide Of what a patriarch in such hour should be, Rebellion had the tempting God denied, And back recoiled from vocal Deity. But faith the hoary friend of God inspired, And mortal Will before a Voice divine Fell like a sacrifice, by love attired And offer'd freely on Religion's shrine. Obedience absolute, submission's law, On this alone the patriarch's eye was bent, And God was greater than the grief he saw, Whose Hand recall'd the mercy He had lent. Perchance, 'twas in the hush of holy night The dread command to offer Isaac came, E'en while the father, lull'd with fond delight, In dreams parental murmur'd Isaac's name. For, soon as Morning o'er the orient hills Shook the bright dewdrops from her beaming hair, Behold, the sire his sacred work fulfils, Strong with resolve, and sanctified by prayer. But ah! forgive him, if from Sara's eye His shrinking heart refused to take farewell; He could not trust the cadence of a sigh Which might have hinted, what he dared not tell. Three days they travell'd on, that son and sire, And sought together Christ's prophetic hill, Where this must bleed in sacrificial fire, And that His own devoted offspring kill. It was indeed a spectacle profound And touch'd with majesty, and truth how meek! When the hoar'd Patriarch on bland Isaac bound The wood for sacrifice,—and did not speak. Part II. THE MORAL. But when at length a signal cloud reposed On the lone hill, where God would have the deed, Did not the hand which then a knife enclosed Tremble, and all the father in him bleed? And, hark, how piercing, like a thrill of death, Clave through his soul one simple cry of love, “My father!”—in the fondness of that breath How did the patriarch seek for strength above! “My father!” and he answer'd, “Here I am;” “The wood behold, and here the needed fire, But where is found the sacrificial lamb Which God ordain'd should in the flame expire?” “God will provide!”—'twas all he dared to speak; So went the pilgrims to their awful task, The blood grew paler on the patriarch's cheek, But no deliv'rance did cold reason ask. The Lord had spoken! He who cannot err, His fiat issued, “Slay thy son for Me;” True to his God,—rebellion shall not stir. But Faith adore Him on submissive knee. And ne'er did infant with its clinging form And tiny limbs of tenderness, embrace The fondling circle of a mother's arms, When she enclasps it,—with a blander grace, Than did calm Isaac to the cordage yield His frame for havoc on the burning pile; Not once outcried he at the coming death, But gazed on Slaughter with religious smile. His limbs are bound, and on the altar laid Behold the parent sees an only son! And now, both hand and heart display'd A faith unparagon'd, since time begun. But God is mercy: hark! like thunder mild From clouds of golden beauty rolls the cry, “Friend of Jehovah! spare thine offer'd child, And mark yon victim, in the thicket nigh.” Believer! Christ was in that angel-voice, And His atonement typed in all the scene,— Child of Jehovah's everlasting choice Who hath the Isaac of salvation been. But would we in some lower range of truth Search for the holy spells our hearts require? Then may we trace them on that sainted youth, And see them mirror'd in his matchless sire. By large devotion of our loving will, Like the meek Isaac's let our spirit bend, And with unreas'ning faith at once fulfil Whate'er the fiat of our God may send: To live, or die, be healthy, sick, or sad, In wealth to bask, or poverty to bleed, In gloom to perish, or in peace be glad,— Let God decide, who understands our need. And ye, who clasp with such intense desire Of fond retention in life's vale below, The breathing Idols whom your souls admire, Think of the patriarch in some night of woe! The fondest heart, round which affection twines, Is most obtain'd when most in God enjoy'd, And happiness with sacred lustre shines, When not by shades of selfish will alloy'd. Disciples must not, like the godless, cleave To aught created in this world of sense; Nor round the ruins of the present grieve, As though the future had no Providence! The cherish'd Isaacs of our heart and creed Like a pure holocaust of grace must fall, And on Love's altar, while we inly bleed, To heaven and duty Faith must offer all. The dearest sacrifice is aye the best, And let us yield it, though severe the rod; For on this truth may bleeding Anguish rest,— We lose an idol, but we gain a God. PERFECT PEACE. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.”—Isa. xxvi. 3. Humility doth mark The child of heaven within salvation's ark: Through all his hallow'd ways He harps the hymn of ever-deep'ning praise, For mercies which surpass The power of numbers to recount, or class;— Yet, sins as sumless claim a constant tear, That God, by prayer invoked, may hush all guilty fear! But humble though the hearts Of God's own children, this their creed imparts,— A boldness to believe That Christ is near them, when His chosen grieve: Though each an atom seem Lost in vast glories which around Him stream, Each individual heart and lonely mind In Christ a Brother clasps, and bears its doom resign'd. No mere Abstractions dead, By science out of arid reason bred, And call'd creation's laws, Which Sense adoreth as presiding Cause,— A faith divine can own; But o'er all life perceives the Saviour's throne: A God tripersonal believers love, And in Emmanuel's name seek all they find above. Though moral earthquakes shock The Systems round us, till they reel and rock; While mad Opinion rules, And Satan out of pride begets dark schools Of sentiment, or sin, Which scorn without, and stifle Truth within.— A more than halcyon in his bosom reigns, Who hath a Heart in heaven which echoes all his pains. Unstable is weak earth; And nothing which in space, or time, has birth, A resting-place can give To Souls who on this tearful world must live; Since wayward passions will Haunt the vex'd world, and never leave it still;— The gnawing fever of some inward pain Is all unchristian hearts from their false life obtain. But, there is peace divine, A calm unrippled, which, O God! is Thine; A rest of saintly thought From out the deeps of heaven by mercy brought; It droppeth like a dew The Hermon of the heart distilling through, And, 'mid the restless change time undergoes, That peace remains unmarr'd, above convulsive woes. Salvation rears the walls Of that truth-keeping race whom Jesu calls; Under His shielding arms The burden'd mind escapes from sinful harms; And while transgressors roam Abroad unrestful, and the same at home, No dread concussion in the realms of Time Can rob believing souls of this their calm sublime. Descend then, Prince of Peace! And with thy Spirit bring worn minds release; When skies and seas depart Serene eternity of truth Thou art, Lord of celestial life! Beyond our sorrows, and above our strife;— Yet so benignant, that Thine eye can see Each pulse of loving prayer which throbs the heart to Thee. STARRY DREAMS. “Tell the stars if thou be able to number them.”—Gen. xv. 5. “He telleth the number of the stars: he calleth them all by their names.”—Ps. cxlvii. 4. “We have seen his Star in the East.”—Matt. ii. 2. Their names and numbers who can tell, Yon quiv'ring gems of mystic light! That throb with such irradiant spell And fascinate our dreaming sight; So countless looks their burning throng No finite thought their sum can hold; For, like a secret, they belong To One by numbers uncontroll'd. How beautiful their lustres are! Whether on infant-eyes they gleam, Which often, like some pensive star, Glance moisten'd with a mournful beam: Or, when in elder life we gaze On each faint pulse of throbbing fire, Till feeling hearts reflect the rays And mirror back what they inspire. So fair to each and all they shine, Stars often seem responsive Eyes That greet us from their calm divine, And answer our ascending sighs. Attracted out of earth and time The starry vault of air we roam, And dream the poetry sublime, Which makes each orb a spirit's home: A home, perchance, where, bright and blest, The loved, but not the lost, remain, Whom there embower'd in blissful rest Our souls may clasp in heaven again. Ye dead! whose tombs are loving hearts, Whose epitaphs, memorial tears, Whose image from no scene departs, But shades the colour of our years, Not seldom, when the noise of day Beneath the trance of dewy night Is hush'd, and meekly dies away The last wan smile of waning light, Lone martyrs of dejection steal From the harsh scene of crowd and care, Religion in the stars to feel As though enshrined in glory there. How eloquent that voiceless hour! Holy, as if creation knelt,— Or mute before her Maker's power Thrill'd Earth some adoration felt. Yet, would that in primeval days These orbs of speaking light had known No worship which mere wonder pays, And orient verse hath often shown; For oh! their beauty, radiance, power, Which seem'd oracularly bright, Such myst'ry wove at midnight hour That gods they grew to heathen sight. Yet not by us, in Christ renew'd, Pure members of His Body made, Are heaven's bright miracles so view'd, Though dazzling be their spell display'd. We love them! for indeed they look So placid, mournful, pale and mild, That when we read Night's starry book, We spell it, like a lisping child. Like gleaming Apparitions sent, They beckon man on high, to see His home enspheres yon firmament, That shines in starr'd eternity. And tears will often through the eyes Distill the heart, and make us seem As though we sail'd cerulean skies, Unbodied in some astral dream! But more than sentiment and song The host of heaven from hearts excite, Who feel that to such orbs belong Deep lustres which excel the light. For, can we not pure incense bring To Him, the bright and Morning Star? Some anthems round His cradle sing, Surpassing eastern magi far? Though jewell'd mines we cannot give, Not ours, but us, Emmanuel claims; And if on Him by love we live, His breastplate bears our chosen names. Be ours the incense of a soul, Through faith and fellowship divine Rising beyond where planets roll,— And richer than Arabia's mine. True sacrifice is love alone: And worship from unwav'ring Hearts, To Him Who wields creation's throne A throb of finite bliss imparts. Without it, vile are myrrh and gold, And vain the swell of soaring word,— For He who can our thought behold, A loveless prayer has never heard. So may the church to Christ present Our body, spirit, soul, and all, That truth and grace omnipotent May us elected children call. Such worship will be hail'd on high Where uncreated glories shine, When heavenward soars the wafted sigh Which meekly warbles, “Christ is mine. “In life and death, my Lord, Thou art, Celestial Prophet, Priest, and King! True incense is a grateful heart, And this makes all my love can bring.” CHRIST OUR PORTION. “There is none on earth I desire besides thee.”—Ps. lxxiii. 25. “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.”—Ps. xvi. 5. “Your life is hid with Christ in God.”—Colos. iii. 3. Whom have I in the heavens but Thee Adoring faith desires to see, Divinely pure and perfect fair Whom all Thy works and words declare? The heavenliness of heaven art Thou, Who bor'st the curse upon Thy brow; And round the Throne no glories shine Which issue not from Thee, or Thine. Imbruted Minds, that think, nor pray, Basking in pleasure's sensual ray,— No cloud appears to shade their sky, And nothing tells them Sin must die! Yet, soon the lying spell recedes, The worm awakes, and conscience bleeds When sickness chokes the ebbing breath, And life is darken'd into death. Oh, in that hour of shudd'ring prayer Eternity from God may glare, And luridly emerge from hell Secrets, and Shapes, no tongue can tell! Lord of true bliss, in joy and health Be Thou our wisdom, hope, and wealth; Without Thee, vain are creatures all!— A universe we nothing call If center'd not in this high creed, That God alone can help our need; Christ in the creature is the goal Of all which should attract the soul. The Lord our true perfection is, Both law of Being, and the bliss; Dark, dead, and cold, creation seems, If not enrobed with sacred gleams Caught from the Presence, and the power Of Christ, who hallows scene and hour, Matter and mind, and makes them good, By showing each with heaven imbued. Friendship and love, though pure and deep, Can echo not lone cares which sleep Unsyllabled within the mind, And shun the gaze of mortal kind. And shifting hues there play of thought, And feelings with devotion fraught, Dejected hours, and voiceless moods When souls are thinking solitudes,— Sigh, tear, nor language then reveals The awful gloom pale conscience feels, When man's o'erburden'd heart within Bows with eternity, and sin. Alone we live, alone we die, Unfathom'd by no human eye, But search'd by Him, whose wisdom can Peruse the depths of inward man. Thus, orphan'd Souls who cannot see On earth one source of sympathy, Whose hearts unecho'd pray and beat, Are answer'd at the Mercy-Seat, Where Heaven's incarnate Love replies To each mysterious heart that sighs, And while unwitness'd tear-drops fall, In grace descends, and dries them all. God in the mind makes glory there, The spring of thought, the source of prayer; From Whom adoring saints derive Stern grace against themselves to strive. Let God then thy religion be, And not religion, God to thee: Without Him, worlds would leave us poor, And with Him, who can want for more? ANGELS. “Of the Angels he saith, Who maketh his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.”—Heb. i. 7. “Some have entertained Angels unawares.”—Heb. xiii. 2. Ye bright-wing'd Choir! who in the rays Which beautify yon realm of glory, Delight to read in rich amaze, The archives of redemption's story,— More magical your lustres seem Than ever crowded poet's dream. Before the countless stars began To glisten through the dewy air, Or Heaven perceived adoring man Ascend her crystal height with prayer, Your beaming Shapes, around the Throne, Ages of wordless joy had known. Serene, and passionless, and pure, Unshaded by the hue of sin, No discord can the will allure To mar each moral tone within,— That melody of sainted love, The pulse of bliss which beats above. Dread Angels! who excel in strength, And sung creation's birthday song, Or, through the world's unmeasured length In viewless splendour wing'd along,— When God commands them, glide and go, With speed that proves the lightning slow! Stern ministers of sacred wrath, How often their avenging hands Emptied God's vials o'er the path Of guilt, and atheistic lands, When blood and blasphemy began To render earth a hell for man. Yon cities, cinder'd by the burst Of red destruction's rolling flame; The myriads by the plague accurst, Whose ruin darken'd David's name; And banner'd hosts, which in one night Were blasted by resistless blight,— Oh! these reveal how dread and vast In bodiless and bright array Such Angels are, who have not cast Their crowns of innocence away; But ranged before the Godhead, still, Brighten as each obeys His will. And when we turn to that high Word Where Christ, and church, and christian meet, Are not emotions deeply stirr'd, To mark above the Mercy-Seat How studious Angels bend and strain, To see what truths its depths contain? Confirm'd, tho' not redeem'd by Him, Lord of the radiant hosts above, Legions of loyal seraphim In Christ concenter all their love; Thus saints and angels both combine To chant the praise of Blood Divine. And bless'd as beautiful the thought, That when man's rebel-heart they see Repent for sin the soul hath wrought, They arch their wings in ecstasy; While louder, louder swells the tone These harpers chant around the Throne! And is not earth the haunt and home Of mysteries more than sense descries, Where viewless Spirits round us roam, Unvisioned by embodied eyes?— Hence that which science never saw, Seems more an angel than a law. The motions of material things So wonderful, involved, and vast, Each hue and harmony that brings Expression, where our looks are cast, Serene, or exquisite, or grand,— Some working angel may have plann'd. And, when amid the flushing noon Faith wanders forth in woods, or fields, Or hearkens to the breezy tune A choral landscape round her yields, And thus with calm contentful eye Drinks the deep spell of earth and sky,— Then, dream not that impassive laws Can e'er achieve what mind must do; If each effect presumes a cause, Let Nature have her master too; Till all her work, beneath the sun Seems duty, by an Angel done. The meanest object man can view, A herb, a pebble, or a ray Which tints the grass with golden hue, Might prompt poetic mind to pray; And Faith can nothing coldly see, If there angelic spell-work be. And, oh! how solemn grows the scene When not beheld as dumb and dead, But one where spirits intervene, And such a consecration shed, That, like a temple, common air Inspires religion every-where! As features in some lovely face Express the soul, eye cannot see, And shadow forth with speaking grace Each line of sorrow, hope, or glee,— Moved elements may oft reveal What angels from cold sense conceal. Thus, sun and air, and cloud-graced heaven, The lisping wave, or laughing wind, With whatsoe'er to earth is given Attuned to man's accordant mind, Should make us dream, where'er we stray, Unvision'd angels throng the way. The sunbeam in its happy toil, The breeze that fans an infant flower, Those dew-falls which refresh the soil Or beautify a sylvan bower,— Pure Minds with peaceful wonder fill, Who trace them to angelic skill. The motion of mysterious storms That glance and play with hectic gleam, May be the flutter of their forms, The glory which their garments beam, When, summon'd by their vast control, The fiery tempests flash and roll! RELIGION AND THE SEA. “Fear God, and worship him that made the sea.”—Rev. xiv. 7. “Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.”—Matt. xiv. 25. Eternity of waters! there Thou art, Dear to the eye, and glorious to the heart; Bounding in brightness as they plunge on shore, I greet thy waves, and gladden in their roar. Alone in grandeur, ever-living Sea! Thou swelling anthem sung to Deity, When thy deep thunders with a dying fall Roll like Hosannahs to the Lord of All. Religion only to thy power replies And echoes back the solemn harmonies, Which seem to tell with supernatural tone,— Here God is reigning on His ocean-throne! And ever, O thou Element of might! Hast thou administer'd a dread delight To all who heard thy loud pulsations beat, Till shores embay'd seem'd throbbing at their feet. Before the birth of billow, or of wind, Thou rolledst through the Everlasting Mind In waves hereafter destined to expand, And bathe the shores of many a famous land. Man rules the earth, but God upon the sea By vast distinction doth appear to be, Whose swelling glories baffle change and time, And awe the conscience, like a creed sublime. Kindred with man, deep Ocean! movest thou, Baring to heaven thine ever-dauntless brow; In all the murmurs of thy mighty heart A mystic echo of his mind thou art. Passion intense, and sentiment profound In thee some answer to such moods resound; While haunted Sadness, tender, deep, and lone, Thrills to the pathos of thy pensive tone. Genius and Glory, both in thee delight, Heard in gay morn, or through the hush of night, When, like a psalm, thy billowy tongues proclaim How nature murmurs with her Maker's name. And has not Painting from thy myriad views Of liquid grace, and oceanic hues, An inspiration for her colours caught, Making immortal what thy spell has wrought? The Poet, too, in ev'ry age hath been A solemn haunter of thy wizard scene; In breeze, or blast, rich noon, or balmy eve, To him thy waves cathedral-anthems weave. He can interpret thine impassion'd mood, And sympathise with sea-made solitude; By rock and bay, or sanded beach can roam And feel immensity his proper home. Nor need we tell how Commerce hath supplied An empire's storehouse from the wafting tide, Since on thy waters, far as winds can flee, Her boundless treasures are attain'd by Thee. Still less doth Valour need victorious lyres To sing how Britain's heart the sea inspires:— The Isle of Freedom is the friend of waves, That field of battle where the world she braves! And will not heroes of the Cross who roam, Far from the spells which bind the heart to home, To tell the heathen how the Lord is King, Chants of true glory to old Ocean bring?— Majestic, lone, and melancholy Sea! Sprung from thy God in dread immensity, For aye art thou to reverential mind A floating wonder by no words defined. A vast eternity in endless flow Thine image wears; and in thy depths below How sleep the young, the beautiful, and brave, Till the last trumpet shall unclose their grave! Farewell! thou symbol of almighty grace, Whose deeps adumbrate what for our lost race Mercy provides, when pardon's hush'd abyss Engulphs the guilt which loads a world like this. Eternal seem'st thou till th' Archangel rings A blast that summons all created things; Then rise the dead from out thy dismal roar, And Time shall gaze upon the sea no more! IDOLS IN THE HEART. “These men set up their idols in their heart.”—Ezek. xiv. 3. “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.”—1 John v. 21. There was a time, in ages dead, When temples huge and vile Their lowering fronts of darkness spread O'er Albion's sea-wall'd isle. But Christ by His apostles came To preach the word divine, And, lo! before truth's living flame Dissolved each idol-shrine. And now, a Church maternal opes Her arms of christian love, Embracing with their new-born hopes Bright children for above. And by her sacraments and rites, Her discipline and care, Calm vigil, fast, and chaste delights, And pure diurnal prayer, With whatsoe'er of secret grace The Lord to her commits, She strives to rear a heavenly race, And each for glory fits. But oh, these hearts we poorly scan If idols none are seen; Their temple is that inner man Where God's own gaze hath been! Eye cannot pierce, nor ear perceive What buried thoughts avow; Yet souls, who dare the Spirit grieve, Must to some idol bow. We shudder when Christ's heroes find Myriads in pagan gloom, With poison'd heart, and palsied mind, And conscience like a tomb: Such tale when holy Mission tells, Demands the Church's tear; And who can hear of demon-spells Nor throb with sacred fear? But, are not souls baptised a home For God enshrined within? Father and Spirit, do they come To reign o'er self and sin? Yet, what if our base idol be Desire, instead of God? Proud will,—a strong divinity That rules us with a rod? Say, are we not, before the eye Of Him who fathoms thought, Idolators, whose hearts deny The God our fathers sought? We need not by the stumbling-block Of wood, or stone, or gold, Discerning reason madly shock With shapes which men behold; Idolatry depraves the Will, Our idols are desires, When once our breast some passion fills Which aught, save God, inspires. It may be, that the crown of praise, The wreath proud genius wears, A warrior's plume, or poet's bays Excite ambition's prayers; Or, forms of love, whose grace becomes The bloom and breath of all We value in these earthly homes,— May weave our inward thrall; A husband in the wife may see A heaven of human charms; Or, he to her, life's angel be, A shield from daily harms; Or infant beauty, like a ray From her own being sent, To mother's love, may night and day Impart too deep content: Whate'er the guise, or winning name Our bosom-idols take, Strange incense with our altar-flame Is blent, when we forsake That God who claims the heart alone For His peculiar shrine:— A creature must not mount the Throne Where rules a Love divine. Heirs of the Spirit, are we not Anointed sons of grace? Alas! if our celestial lot By treason we efface. To some base darling of desire, Some earth-made god of sin, Shall censers hold unhallow'd fire, By passion breathed within? Oh, better far that love and life, With hope, and peace, and joy, Howe'er with seeming mercy rife, Some blast from heaven destroy; Better be friendless, aidless, lone, With none to weep our woes, Than let some idol seize that throne Sworn faith to Jesu owes. For what is there, on this side hell, Which so like hell appears?— A doom of dooms! no tongue can tell, Thus rolling on our ears, “Ephraim to idols hath his heart From God and glory turn'd,— Let him alone, and be his part The solitude he earn'd!” INFANTS AND INFANCY. “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise.”—Matt. xxi. 16. The dew-drop, in whose mirror lies A miniature of morning skies; The violet-bud which blooms in spring, The flower-bee on its fairy wing, The broken lisp of some shy brook That babbles in a shady nook, All that is fragile, coy, and fair, As types of beauty, may declare The cherub-loveliness that seems To mantle those embodied dreams, Sweet infants! when their baby forms Come forth to face life's gloomy storms. Oh! I can watch, and almost weep To view some angel-child asleep; To mark the alabaster brow Where sinless calm is brooding now, Or see the silken fringe that lies And covers its innocuous eyes. So have I stood, and heard each breath Like music in melodious death, And soft and slow it swells and heaves, And at each fall such cadence leaves, As may to pious fancy seem A sigh for Glory in its dream. There is a purity which plays In the quick gleam of infant's gaze, That innocence of heaven-born light Which beams for vulgar sense too bright,— A lustrous depth whose dazzling spells Are richer than the blue gazelle's. 'Tis now the budding dawn of mind, Ere the worn heart grows weak and blind; The orient blush of radiant thought Ere life is with those shadows fraught Experience unto manhood brings, Or sorrow round cold memory flings! To see them in glad sunbeams play As bounding and as bright as they, Or, like young wavelets laugh and sing, Or romp like breezes wild of wing Exulting over fields and flowers, When May-time leads the lovely hours,— Oh, this can melt the heart, and make Maturer life new colours take, A sentiment of vernal hue, Which softens down each sterner view Till Age becomes a child again, Encircled by some infant train! But yet, a holier chain there is, The glory of maternal bliss, When first the blossom'd mind is heard, In pretty lisp and prattled word, While, peering through a curious eye, It longs to measure earth and sky. And, beautiful beyond compare An infant kneeling down to prayer! When, lifting up its little hands, The soul beyond the age expands, And, touch'd by God's baptismal grace, Adores bright Merey face to face. And Infancy hath inward speech, A mental life, man cannot reach; For, intercourse of grace may be Between a babe and Deity, Too rapt and raised for oral sign, And deeper than our thoughts divine. There's something holy in a child, Ere yet by darken'd years defiled, When lip, and brow, and cheek declare 'Tis fit for Jesu's arms in prayer; And when to God and glory given, Though born on earth, it breathes of heaven. PARADISE OF THE DEAD. “He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.”—Luke xx. 38. “Absent from the body, present with the Lord.”—2 Cor. v. 8. “This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”—Luke xxiii. 43. “The general assembly of the first-born—the spirits of just men made perfect.”—Heb. xii. 23. The dead in body are in soul alive; Distinct locality to them belongs: No more, like us, with sin and woe they strive, But in those bowers, where rest the white-robed throng With garments by atoning Blood made clean,— Behold! pure Spirits who on earth have been. In years departed, Superstition dared That veil to ruffle with irrev'rent hand, Behind whose folds lie undeclared Secrets no bodied nature understands; For there in awful shades, our God alone Wields His dread sceptre, and holds back His throne! But we are sense-blind, and too much adore The painted dreams which time and space befall; Full seldom do our hearts the dead restore, Or back their features into life recall; Their tombs like portals to oblivion were, That closed upon us, when we laid them there. Material life the sad horizon makes Of half a worldling's creed pronounces true; In soul a Sadducee, his reason takes No holier vision and no higher view, Than poor realities, which Flesh discerns, And earth-sprung feeling into glory turns. But Minds exist to whom the dead are dear; Still in warm memory lives th' unburied past: Their grief is something nobler than the tear Impassion'd Feeling on their coffin cast;— The disembodied to the heart and home, Oft in pale dreams of resurrection come. Shame on our souls! if narrow earth enclose Spirits which have eternity to range; If ne'er beyond the tomb a Christian throws A thought which images their blest exchange, Who neither bound, nor barr'd by blinding sense, Reap in rapt bliss what Light and Love dispense. A conscious portion of the Church are they Who speed before us to the realm unknown; Although no longer in the beams of day They lift their brow, and call this life their own, Yet do they all to that One Christ pertain, Who out of dust shall rear their forms again. Nor, let the worshipper of sense, who binds To this base world an eagle-spirit down, And only in the realm of Epicurus finds His grandest sceptre and his brightest crown,— Reflect on Hades, where the dead repose, As whelm'd with darkness in a land of woes: 'Tis worse than pitiful, when men presume Our God to limit to this world of crime; Who call it vacancy beyond the tomb, And make eternity succumb to time! Whereas the Spirit, when unearth'd and free, Is far diviner than this life can be. Think on the numbers who to Christ have fled, From babes too beautiful on earth to stay, To those departing with a hoary head, Beside whose couch 'twas heaven to watch and pray;— Myriads which no created mind can count, Complete the glory of that great amount. And could we gaze beyond an earth-bound screen, No barren solitude our eyes would view; But, all empeopled with a host serene The world of spirits would emerge as true, And far more vital, glowing quick with mind, Than this dull orb the Dead have left behind. And oh! bethink thee, pilgrim, sad and lone, Musing through capitals, where Ages dead Lie sepulchred, and riven arch and stone Reveal what desolation's curse hath bred,— That all who throng'd some immemorial street, Are mingled souls which now in Hades meet. So, when thou linger'st on some battle-plain Dyed by red carnage once, where Nations fell, While banner'd thousands heard the iron rain Of death-shot round about them roar, and swell,— The spirits who that crimson light did face, Are yet alive, and fill their destined place, And in the churchyard, where some grassy mound In trampled ruin all unweeded stands, Or sculptured aisles, where marble tombs abound And memory ponders while the mind expands, Till saints and warriors, heroes, martyrs, all Speak out of stone, and to the living call,— Forget not, while the vaulted nave is trod, That each unbodied is a thinking Soul Under the blessing or the ban of God, Replete with life, as when their felt control By sceptred majesty, or moving speech, The heart of empires and of men did reach. Thus should we speculate on parted Mind, And speak with tones of reverential truth, Whene'er the screening veil of sense behind Religion enters, and on age and youth Dreams with pale awe, and hails the sumless host Who still are loved, and not to faith the lost. Yes, be our epitaphs of brighter cast, And take our elegies a purer tone, Nor speak, as if corporeal life surpass'd The consciousness a spirit calls its own:— Mere flesh can moulder, yet the Soul survives, And in that thought there breathe immortal lives! SUBLIME OF PRAYER. “I beseech thee, show me thy glory.” Exod. xxxiii. 18. Heroic guide of Judah's race Who saw Jehovah face to face, Sublime of men!—behold him now, As there enshrined, within the cloud Which wraps him like a burning shroud, He boldly breathes the prayer, “O God, unveil Thy brow. “Eternal! in the flaming sign What though I saw dread beams combine, When Sinai's bush was clothed with fire, Or on Thy cloudy pillar gazed,— Yet when the riven mountain blazed With Thy descending pomp, I dared for more aspire! And I have fasted, pray'd, and felt For forty days my being melt With wand'ring awe, as Thou didst trace That ‘Pattern’ whose mysterious plan O'erveil'd the future Christ for man, And prophesied in types, the hidden truths of grace. “And I have heard that thunder-tone Which thrills high angels round the throne,— The rollings of celestial Voice; And seen unearthly lightnings play, Which lit me up that rocky way When Thy dread law decreed for life, or death, the choice. “And now, I would no symbol see, But gaze on full-orb'd Deity; Thy glory let me witness now: God of my soul! before I die, Centre on Thee my thirsting eye, And let Thy lustres bright through all my being flow!” So prayed the meek, but yet the bold Giant of grace, who would behold The Self Eternal!—God reveal'd Not in the shadow, nor the sign, But in deep radiance all-divine, Where dwells the viewless God, all gloriously conceal'd. It was, indeed, a prayer sublime Surpassing all conceived in time, Or nature,—scaling that dread height Where Attributes are searchless things, And Seraphim reverse their wings, And shrink, and shudder back, before Essential Light. Yet, God is moved by mighty prayer; And Moses found his answer there, When ark'd within the cloven side Of Horeb's sacramental rock,— Jehovah “passed” him, while the shock Of glory shook the soul, till awed Convulsion cried. But we, who with reverted gaze Can rend the veil of typic days, May in the Church a glory view Outshining far what Moses saw, When God in thunder gave the law, And lightnings red and fierce around Mount Tabor flew. And is not this the prayer intense Of all, who soar above what sense And self and sin combine to claim,— That more and more meek hearts may rise To vision with prophetic eyes What hidden splendours haunt Jchovah's hallowed name? Divine ambition must be ours; And faith so form the mental powers Under Emmanuel's teaching grace, That love in earth, and sea, and air, May find reflected ev'ry-where The glories which effulged before great Moses' face. And how seraphic proves the spell In those deep hearts, which love to dwell Within the inner shrine of things!— Who can all scenes in Christ behold, And see, as in bright trance unroll'd, The charms He there unveils, beyond what poet sings. Standard and type for all who pray, Be this the liturgy we say To Him who hears the spirit cry, “Thy deeper glories, God! unshroud; Break, I beseech Thee, break the cloud, And on Thyself unveil'd, oh, let me rest mine eye.” The highest saint who heavenward soar'd, Prophet, or priest, who God adored, In this vast prayer their motto find: Such Hearts will hunger, Lord of grace! To look upon Thy perfect face, And in that light supreme to love all human kind. REPENTANCE. “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Matt. iii. 2. Wake, power divine, awake! Arm of the Lord! arise, And from our spirit take The mist which round it lies; Each blinding shade of self dispel That veils the sin we love so well. Stern Preacher of the wild! Enrobed with camel-hair, Convince cold hearts defiled, And melt them into prayer; Through conscience be thy thunder sent,— “Arise! cold sleeper, and repent.” Bold lightnings of reproof Through each dead conscience dart, Till we no more aloof From heaven shall hide the heart: E'en as of old, Judéa heard, Be all our souls with anguish stirr'd. Lift, brave Elijah, now That voice of dauntless truth! Till shame upon each brow Of weeping age and youth Shall print the scarlet blush that tells What pang in deep repentance dwells. Thine axe, Conviction, lay Down to the roots of thought, Until Remorse shall pray O'er all vile sin hath wrought: For that which love doth not inspire Must perish in God's penal fire. And let repentance prove Its vigour by the fruit; That cannot spring from love Which doth not bud, and shoot, And by a life of tears and prayers Attest the change God's will declares. Thy fan, O Spirit! wield, And purge the chaff-strewn floor, Until the garner yield Of wheat a precious store; Baptised with fire, so let us be, And bid our hearts resemble Thee. “Repent ye!”—'tis the cry By conscience echoed back; From earth and vaulted sky Along our sin-worn track, We hear its awful cadence roll Like thunder through our warnèd soul. Nor let religious pride On fruitless names repose; For heaven hath aye denied A faith of forms and shows, And, rather than rank falsehood own, Will raise a seed from out the stone. “Repent!”—again we hear That cry of just alarm; And let it shake the soul with fear, To rouse the opiate charm Which lulls the hypocrite to death, And cheats him to his latest breath. Repentance!—what is life But matter fit for tears? Since, all we are is rife With worse than what appears: If tried without, men are but sin; Yet God discerns the heart within! Our virtues oft are self In bland disguise conceal'd; Our charities to pelf Some wretched incense yield, And holy graces are at best But weakness by religion dress'd. Repent we then!—yet, where? Not as Iscariot did; But by the Cross in prayer Be our deep anguish hid: On Jesus gaze we, till the sight Shall melt our hearts, and make them white. Repentance stern and true Exceeds all common woe: Despair for crime may rue And scalding tear-drops flow, But Self in this alone abounds,— Repentance rests on nobler grounds. What is it but a change By Godhead work'd within? A principle whose range Subdues the love of sin? 'Tis man renew'd, and heaven resought, With hate for what our guilt has wrought. And what can this create? Not all the powers of earth; The perfect forms of good and great In wisdom, truth, or worth;— Not heaven with glory, hell with pain Could sinful man for God regain! The faintest sin defies A universe to crush The strength which in it lies; And so, 'twill madly rush Downward to face th' infernal deep Where blasted spirits burn and weep. But, oh, there is a Power This granite of the heart To soften, in that hour Ere conscience may depart,— Atoning Love, through guilt forgiven, The rescued heart can raise to heaven! Such pure contrition springs From Mercy's bleeding charm, Whose soft compulsion wrings The soul with safe alarm; And thus, when wrought by Christ above Repentance works by weeping love. HEARTS WHICH HAVE NO ECHOES. “The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.”— Prov. xiv. 10. Some hearts lie wither'd in their transient spring Long ere the yellow leaf of change began; Seldom to them may human summer bring A beaming welcome from the soul of man. Cinctured as by a preternatural spell, Languid their pulse of low dejection beats; Yet none who mark their smile-clad face, could tell How dark the mood which back from man retreats! And what, though circumstance may seem To gladden life with fortune's envied glow, Or on their brow some bright delusion beam, Hiding the haunted gloom that reigns below,— They bear a burden language could not speak, They feel depression too profound for tears, And blush to fancy a betrayful cheek Should wear the paleness of their inward fears. Yet, say not such sad martyrs of the mind Are fever'd by ambition's vulgar fret; Nor think they loathe the love of human kind, Or hate warm hours when echoing souls are met. But in them dwells the hush'd and voiceless thought, How all which reigns without, or rules within, With grave-like hollowness is ever fraught, Or, canker'd through with selfishness and sin. And oft the bitterness of secret pride Rankles beneath the play of baffled will, While Feeling, wounded by some fate denied, Bleeds at the root, though all without look still. And moods they cherish, passionate as deep, And wing'd desires that eagle-like would soar, Which never waken from their wordless sleep, But prey upon the spirit more and more. And when quick minds, electrically strung As though each chord of feeling moved on fire, Some pang would tell,—how oft the fearful tongue Has felt each accent on the lip expire! And thus there is a loneliness of heart, In all deep souls a never-enter'd shrine, Where neither love nor friendship takes a part, Which no eyes witness, but, Jehovah! Thine. But shall we mourn, that each is circled round With veiling mystery from the ken of man? That waters deep within the soul abound No word has fathom'd, and no wisdom can? No, rather let such merciful disguise Move the just thinker unto grateful prayer; For who could live beneath terrestrial eyes, If such could witness all secreted there! And if no mantle by our God were thrown Round fallen souls, to hide man's world within, How should we hate, what now we love to own, And cry for darkness to conceal our sin! None are so chaste, unselfish, and sincere, As not to feel the taint of Adam's fall; So, heaven in mercy hides that inmost sphere Where each dreads each, and all would censure all. Yet beats One Heart all other hearts above, Whose sympathy no human errors tire, E'en Thine, pure Lord of uncreated love, Incarnate Semblance of The heavenly Sire! There, may we prove deep tenderness divine, And yet, so human that it wept and sigh'd; And when to coldness burden'd hearts incline, Haste we to Him, who loved us till He died. There is no self in that almighty Heart, No changing motion in the casual will, For Thou, Lord Christ! celestial mercy art, And though we shun Thee, Thou art gracious still. O balmy thought! which, like nocturnal dews Whose silver freshness stars the herbless plain, When worse than midnight shades our mental views Recalls Emmanuel to the mind again. Others may gaze with half-averted eyes, Coldly may spurn, or scan the woe we feel, But o'er His heart are breathed our inward sighs, And through His breast our veil'd emotions steal. Nor can one shade of sorrow clothe the cheek, Nor tear-drop from the spirit-fountain roll, But He interprets what no tongue can speak, And reads the thinking volume of our soul. Here boast the saints, what no bright seraph can,— That they have sympathy upon the Throne; Christ loves the Angel, but he feels for man, Whose very nature hath become his Own. No hearts beat echoless, if they believe A more than Brother in yon heavens is theirs, Who loves them most when all alone they grieve, And with His incense can perfume their prayers. His love is greater than our heart, and knows What secret burden loads the inward sigh; And wordless pangs to Him are open woes, Clear as the glories which emblaze the sky. Dear Lord! be ever thus our Friend divine, Our Anchor sure while rocking tempests roli, And when departing into hands like Thine, Relume Thy promise, and receive the Soul. INSPIRATION OF THE PAST. “Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever?”—Zech. i. 5. “God ? in time past, spake unto the fathers.”—Heb. i. 1. Our fathers, where are they, The prophets of the past?— Like solemn dreams, long flown away, And with th' eternal class'd! Those patriarchs of the soul Of lion heart and mien, Scorning the world's depraved control, They hallow'd history's scene; Heroes of faith and prayer, They fought salvation's fight, Ready to do, and boldly dare, When God reveal'd the right. Such were those mental sires Who made our English mind, Whose page the saintly heart inspires, Whose words entrance mankind. Yes! they, indeed, were men Of loftiness divine; And not till such shall breathe again, Will British glory shine. We want majestic hearts Like those which burn'd and bled, When Rome, with her resistless arts, Denied the Church's Head. The dungeon, steel, and stake, A bloody doom, or block, Not one of these their vow could break, When summon'd to the shock. Peaceful as lambs, as lions brave, The saints of hoary time,— Still may we hear them from the grave Preach with a voice sublime. Their tongues are tipp'd with fire, Their accent sounds the free, And into us such men inspire Their own eternity. RELIGION OF THE YOUNG. “Remember now thy Creator, in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not.”—Eccles. xii. 1. And wilt thou bring a virgin heart, And lay it on the shrine Of holy Love, that so the part Of Mary may be thine?— Retreat beneath the Saviour's eye, And to His tones of heaven reply, While outward breath, or inward sigh Adores Him as divine. Then may thy youth securely rest On more than earth bestows; Eternity within thy breast Already throbs, and glows; Thou hast, ere sin the breast alloy, That colour of celestial joy Which brighten'd o'er the sainted boy, Whose cry, “Speak, Lord!” arose. He, to the Temple when a child By his dear mother brought, Ere manhood's guilt the heart defiled With years of sinful thought, Like a young priest his ephod wore; And on his girdled form he bore The truth of all meek Hannah swore, When she the Lord besought. Thus, in the vernal prime of youth How blest are they who bring Their souls a sacrifice for truth, And round Christ's altar sing! Ere shades of evil darkness fall, Like folds of that primeval pall Which, soon or late, envelops all On earth now wandering. Age has not loosed the silver cord, Nor at the fountain-head Doth Weariness pronounce the word, “My pleasant things are fled!” For still around, hope's morning dews Fall freshly on thy fairy views, And Nature wears those lust'rous hues O'er life by feeling spread. In youth there breathes a vital bloom, A buoyancy and glow Which seem to triumph o'er the tomb And gladden off dull woe; Elate as lofty, swells the hope That longs with dangers firm to cope, And ever round some daring scope An eager glance to throw. When years have cast their blighting frown And wither'd prospects pine, While on the head Time's hoary crown Betrays old age is thine, Then, sinner! 'tis a rueful sight, To view thee through thy heart's deep night In horror seek that saving light Which flows from truth divine. It is not, that a dread “too late!” By mortal dare be sigh'd; For never to a brother's fate Be hope of heaven denied: But, oh! methinks when harrowing fears Haunt the dark mind, and bitter tears Like drops of anguish damp the years Of those who God defied; When memory's weak, and conscience quails, And life's gay tone is dead, While hideous doubts the heart assail By base experience bred, 'Tis awful on Death's couch to find Some ruin'd Shape of woe reclined, Sick of the world, but unresign'd In dust to lay his head. Divinest Spirit! truthful Lord, May youth remember Thee, And gladly in Thy glorious word A bright hereafter see:— There, bloom the Canaans of the young, There, fields with hallow'd fruitage hung, Richer than God's own poets sung Should wave in Galilee. Thy grace bestow, that vestal hearts May more and more be given To Thee and Thine, ere youth departs From God,—by passion driven Along that dark and dismal way Where virtues into vices stray, Which tempt polluted souls to say “Earth makes my only heaven!” SYMPATHY OF CHRIST. “Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.”—Ps. lv. 22. Go, cast thy burden on the Lord, Thou laden Bosom! dark and lone; Nor deem thyself by Him unheard Whose heart beats human on the Throne. A Man of sorrows and of tears The Saviour once was like to thee, And learn'd to face those mortal fears Which pierced His soul with sympathy. 'Tis thus we mark Him, homeless, sad, A Pilgrim whose mysterious lot Was shunn'd by all the gay and glad, Unfelt, unpitied, and forgot. Yet learnt He thus from finite woe What heaven's calm glories could not teach,— For there, no tides of anguish flow, And no dark cares that kingdom reach. And is it not a whelming thought, That Christ should leave His heavenly throne To be on earth affliction taught, And suffer more than flesh hath shown! Oh, had He in yon realm of bliss But simply fathom'd what we feel, Could mortals from their sad abyss To Him as brother now appeal? But when we read His matchless life That wept, and sigh'd, and sorrow'd o'er The heavy pangs of human strife, And all which burning conscience bore, Such life becomes a lovely proof That into His deep bosom pass'd Experience, which can ne'er aloof From pilgrims now on earth be class'd. Nor deem, that when on high He soar'd And o'er the radiant heavens retired, By chanting hosts to be adored Whose hymns are by His Blood inspired, What here below as Man He felt, Is now engulph'd in bliss eterne;— Still through His heart emotions melt, And in Him pure affections burn. His regal crown is all divine, And glory-flames engird Him now, But Faith beholds Him still the same, For human feelings line His brow. And thus, O weary, wand'ring soul, By tempest worn, and toss'd, and tried, Though surging waves around thee roll, Thine anchor is The Crucified! Thy sin confess, each sorrow tell, Bold on His love thy burden cast, In heaven Who yet remembers well The storms through which on earth He pass'd. A mother may her babe forget, An exile ne'er his home recall, Nor orphan'd child the hour regret Which reft him of parental all: But, oh, whate'er the scene or clime, Devotion may Emmanuel see, Whose heart expands o'er man, and time, Who bled for our eternity! Yes, sympathies intense and deep Surpassing all our souls contain, Still through His breast in glory sweep, And shall for ever glow and reign. A sinless Lord, yet touch'd in heart With all which blighted moments bear, In heaven, O Priest divine! Thou art A man-God, with our feelings, there! By gentleness, by grief, and grace, By depth of sigh, and tears profound, Faith views Thee to our fallen race In links of loving union bound. Both heaven and earth in Thee combine In Whom that mystic wound appears, Which gash'd in death Thy Form divine, And crimson'd it with gory tears. Then, lay thy burden on the Lord Child of dejection! pale and lone; Thou canst not sigh by Him unheard, Whose heart throbs human on His throne. NO PEACE FOR THE WICKED. “There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” Isa. lvii. 21. How like a spirit shrieks the startled Wind, As though the air to agony were torn, When conscience hears it with a haunted mind, Waking at midnight, fearful and forlorn! No peace apart from purity abides, Deep in the heart some dark unrest will be; Though calmest azure gild the ocean-tides, Stern are the currents which no eye can see. What, if the world, that sees by sense alone, Seldom below the surface of our smiles Surveys the secrets which to God are shown, Believes mock gladness which the truth beguiles; Resounding bursts of Bacchanalian joy Oft though they ring from out the Belial mind,— Be sure there lurks some unbetray'd alloy Of sad rebuke, yon gilded face behind! The peace of sinners is the trance of death, The putrid stillness of a stagnant tomb; Or like the pause before some parting breath Which shakes and shudders o'er eternal doom. But oft this lulling opiate of the heart, By passion drunk while principle expires, Fails in some hour to do its deadly part, When Vengeance lights her agonising fires. And thus the wicked have no vital peace, Nothing which reason, truth, or knowledge makes; The “Blood of Sprinkling” hath not brought release, Nor calm'd the tempest which dark conscience shakes. In vain may riches, rank, and power, and pride, Fawn round the creedless heart and lawless will, There is no heaven but in bad self denied, And less than Godhead can no bosom fill. Man's peace is grounded on majestic truth, Enlightened conscience, hope, and faith-breathed prayer, And they who seek it in hoar'd age, or youth, Yearn for God's Holy One to guide them there. Cold gnaws the worm which on pale conscience feeds,— A darksome pang of dreariness within; And oft in silence sad remembrance bleeds O'er bosom'd stores of unrepented sin. The grave! the grave! its horrent gloom appals The craven souls which no atonement seek, And from hereafter comes the hell that calls The blood of gladness from a blooming cheek. To guilt eternity a dread appears, And God Himself is vision'd as a foe; And how the Throne dark retribution rears, Shades a bright present with prophetic woe! Martyr in soul! with all thy painted smiles, Hie thee at once to free salvation's ark, And shun the snare of those satanic wiles Which dazzle myriads into regions dark. Lo, where The Church with mild maternal tone Thy soul invites to share mysterious peace, Pure as Emmanuel once proclaim'd His own,— Born of The Blood which purchased man's release. Such is the rest, divinely rich and deep, Beyond tempestuous waves of woe to break; Soft as the trances of that blissful sleep Which lull'd the Saviour on the storm-rent lake. Let but the Spirit of the Lord descend And o'er our bosom brood with dovelike sway, Then shall Jehovah be our guardian friend, Point to glad Zion, and protect the way. So will that hollow rest poor worldlings love, No longer o'er the cheated bosom reign; But Peace, descending from her Prince above, Becalm our conscience like His breath again. INFANT DEATH. “Rachel, weeping for her children.”—Matt. ii. 18. “Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears ? they shall come again from the land of the enemy.”— Jer. xxxi. 16. Pale mother! art thou weeping Beside yon cradled form, Which now reclines unsleeping In fever's raging storm? Fair mourner, let me feel for thee, Engulph'd in such an agony. Thine eyes are red with sorrow, And sunken back with woe; Or ever dawns to-morrow, Thy heart will overflow, While tears of burning anguish lave The victim of an early grave. Such death seems like the rushing All sudden, fierce, and strong, Of chainless whirlwind, crushing The forest-boughs along; As onward sweeps that rending blast, Wild ruins tell its wings have pass'd. Yet, mother! when caressing Thy darling in thine arms, While brooding o'er the blessing So treasured in its charms, Did not this dream thy soul appal,— “Perchance my living flower must fall?” And often, when surveying Its mournful depth of eye, A something seem'd arraying Those features for the sky,— A pensive meaning, sad and mild, Too earthless for an earth-doom'd child. But since the Soul hath parted, Above that baby face Thou bendest, broken-hearted; For, cold as sculptured grace, The whiteness of that cherub brow Maternal tear-drops moisten now! Yet be not thou repining, And nurse the pang unmeet, Because, no longer shining Thy glow of love to greet, Infantile charms and elfin ways Are welcomed by thy doting gaze. Like cherubim surrounding The Throne where Jesu reigns, With more than bliss abounding, And touch'd by no earth-stains,— Unbodied infants, in the blaze Of Godhead, lisp their perfect lays. Nor dream, because unspoken In flesh, the word of grace, Thy darling had no token Of God's paternal face; Baptismal wonders oft infold A germ of Christ no creeds have told. Think not, that when translated To realms of hallow'd bliss, An infant can be rated By such base world as this: In heaven transform'd, its mind expands, And more than scripture understands. Then, cheer thee! stricken mother, Let praise ennoble tears; Thy babe has found a Brother In yonder heaven-bright spheres; For God's Elect, the Undefiled, Was once on earth a cradled Child. Though now enshrined in glory, What here below He felt As read in awful story, Doth still remembrance melt; As if the babe His bosom press'd, For ever thrill'd That gracious Breast. Though viewless, yet not banish'd, Thine infant, conscious now, From this cold world hath vanish'd In heaven to lift its brow, Where babes redeem'd, in radiant white Girdle the Throne, with angels bright. A PERFECT WILL. “Then cometh Jesus ? to be baptized ? Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.”— Matt. iii. 13, 15. Thou, who didst rend the heavens to be The Man, in whom God's eye should see A human Archetype of all His wisdom could perfection call, From Thy sad manger to the tomb Through shades of grief, and storms of gloom, Implicitly Thy passive will Each dictate of the law did lovingly fulfil. When Peter's rude and reinless zeal Would fain have bade Thee scorn to feel The pangs a felon's death must bear, What did the Prince of Peace declare?— “Get thee behind me, Satan! thou Of man, not God, dost savour now; Disciple if thou dar'st to be, Martyr thy human will, and meekly follow me!” The dauntless Eremite who saw His Lord obey baptismal law, And meekly as a lamb descend Beneath a sacrament to bend, And in God's mystic waters lave A Form which came the world to save,— At once recoil'd with holy dread, And, gazing on the Lord, aloud in wonder said: “Wilt Thou, by God and angels prized, Prince of all peace! be thus baptized By one like me, whose atom worth Is but a speck of sinful earth? Rather baptize me with that fire Of holiness Thou dost respire; Too abject am I here to stand, Or on Thy sandall'd feet to lay my soilèd hand.” So spake th' Elijah of the wild; But He, of woman born, and mild As moon-lit water, when a breeze Tones the soft accent of the seas, Bent o'er the Baptist His meek brow, And answer'd, “It becomes us now;” And lo! at once the laving stream Shed o'er His awful face its sacramental gleam. And as He rose from that green bank, Yon heavens the scene of wonder drank Into their depths, which saw their King To God such ritual glory bring! Obedience then received a crown Surpassing all sublime renown, The Law obtains from perfect will Bodied by angels forth, who all His work fulfil. But while by yon enraptured Heaven Peals of divine applause are given, And downward on His wings of love Descends the everlasting Dove, And ere that thunder-voice hath ceased Proclaiming how The Father's “pleased,” Let the saved Church a truth discern, And man's o'er-reas'ning heart a lofty science learn. Subjection is our love divine; Believer! let its law be thine: “All righteousness,” however small Cold reason may its canons call, Compliant Faith will yearn to do, Finding in Christ her model true; Nor dare to dream men suffer loss When duty points the way, and God provides the Cross. And, wouldst thou like thy Master be? Go, find him near that ancient sea, Where the awed Baptist on His head The sacramental water spread; There, as thou wander'st, seek a will Which can all rectitude fulfil, And consecrate thine inmost soul To that unfathom'd Law no reason can control. And then may He, whose glory came On mystic plumes of dovelike flame, That Spirit, who on Christ did pour The sevenfold grace His priesthood bore,— Some drops of saving unction give By which believing martyrs live; Till thou, in all thy works and ways, Shall unto God devote the priesthood of thy days. CHIEF OF SINNERS. “Jesus came to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” 1 Tim. i. 15. Low in the dust, oh! let me lie, And heavenward lift my asking eye, Till Christ becalm with lenient gaze The pang which on my conscience preys. The more I think, the more I feel This heart hath proved in woe and weal A Cain-like rebel to my God, Whate'er the path experience trod. My past appears one blended crime, Extending through all scene and time, And well may conscience quail to see How Self dethroned the Deity! Ay, Self has proved the spring of all Enamour'd eyes perfection call; Thought, will and motive, deed and word, In each vile Self has been preferr'd. Here is the Upas-blast of sin! The poison-blight which burns within, The venom'd source of vicious life, With treason to the Godhead rife. 'Tis Self by whose defiling breath The soul deserves eternal death; A taint whose omnipresent power Contaminates man's purest hour. It matters not, what form it takes, When human will our God forsakes:— The essence of all sin we find, Not in the flesh, but in the mind. When passions nurse their lava-fires, Or Belial lust the blood inspires, Or vice, and vulgar riot reign, There Self reveals its coarser stain. But may not sin defile that soul Where bland refinement wields control, While art, and taste, and beauty dwell, And Culture charms with graceful spell? Yes, there while nature's glories rise To fascinate our partial eyes, And painting, poetry, and speech, A throne of regal magic reach, While private zeal, or public worth Adorns the land which gives them birth, Believe not, in this bright display, That Sin and Self have died away! Yea, rather may refinement shroud A godless will beneath a cloud, And lull the conscience, till it fail To know if God, or man, prevail. Thus, “chief of sinners!” forms the cry Of all who see with inward eye That self is sin, howe'er disguised, And by approving falsehood prized. On these Heaven's perfect law will dart Those searching beams which bare the heart, Till each fine chord of feeling there Thrills into dread, and throbs with prayer. DIVINE THIRST. “My soul thirsteth for God.”—Ps. xlii. 20. As pants the hart for living brooks So pines my soul for Thee; Away from this lone earth it looks, And longs Thy face to see. Thrice Holy One! athirst I am From man's false world to fly, And on the glories of the Lamb To feast my fasting eye. 'Tis here a bleak and barren land Where hearts and hopes are vain; But Faith perceives at Thy right hand, Supernal wonders reign. There pleasures bloom which cannot lead Compliant souls to sin; And all celestial Love decreed Victorious martyrs win. No shades of guilt or sorrow now Athwart remembrance roll; Eternity unveils its brow, And God enshrines the soul. Those pulses of ethereal bliss Which here so feebly play, Shall throb within a realm like this, Divine beyond decay! At length we find our purest dreams Of finite rapture flown, When saints are basking in the beams Which glorify Thy Throne. The Past will not return in sighs, The Future ne'er appal, The present charm celestial eyes With Christ, the All in All. And dared men like rapt David feel, Our frigid hearts would be On fire with archangelic zeal, That heaven of Heavens to see! THE HEART'S TREASURE. “Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven ? for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”—Matt. vi. 19, 21. Men of faith's heroic mould! Who your birthright have not sold, But the heirship of God's truth Have preserved to age from youth, Let the freedom of your soul No debasement draw from earth, But the Law of heaven control What you deem of peerless worth. “Let not earth your treasure be, Ne'er from rust and robber free; But in heaven behold a mine Where the gold is all divine; That which mortal love doth measure As of time the truest spell, Aye becomes a witching treasure Where false hearts delight to dwell.” Miser! with thy golden heap Glaring through perturbèd sleep, In thy wealth no wisdom lies; Yet thy soul doth sacrifice Heaven and hope, with all the bliss Which on high the pure await; Gilded clay thy treasure is, And how cursed thine envied state! Worldling! who for earth-prized gain Creed and conscience both wilt strain; Fill'd, and fever'd o'er with cares, Doom'd to be but Sorrow's heirs, Dwarf'd and mean thy nature grows, Day by day intensely vile; Deeper far than virtue knows, Coils the serpent in thy smile! Patriot! in whose haughty plan Looks reveal'd a heaven for man, Madly dreaming time and sense All in all for man dispense, Brain may work, and genius build Schemes of most colossal name, But o'er visions unfulfill'd Thou shalt sing the dirge of shame. Student! cloister'd in the cell Haunted with some hoary spell Books of sages and of seers Breathe from immemorial years,— Rich and radiant are the hopes Round thy soul that beam and play, But ambition with thee copes, And of this thou art the prey. Poet! thou art priest of song; Heaven and earth to thee belong; Beauty, grandeur, love and grace Circle round the bardic race; Seize thy harp, and sweep the chords Till they glow with mental fire, And like oracles, rich words Roll from thy melodious lyre; But if gold, or gain intrude On thy soul in solitude, If mere passion for renown Should assail thy minstrel-crown, Should thy chant, debauch'd and base, E'er for sordid end be sung, Angels blush for thy disgrace,— Would thy harp were never strung! Lord! and will affections be Fill'd with dust, and dead to Thee, If around one heart they twine, With a passion half divine? Teach us, then, no creature can Saint, or seraph-heart enchain, But it mars the mighty plan,— God alone as God must reign! Mother! 'tis a beauteous sight When thou watchest day and night Fondly round some elfin creature Budding with maternal feature, Oft in cradled slumber rock'd, Flush'd with fascination's dreams, While each baby hand enlock'd Clasp'd in adoration seems; But if love should Christ betray, And devotion steal away From the God of babes, and men, Wilt thou not be chasten'd then? Or perchance, when fever'd breath From thy little one is heaving, Thou wilt learn by infant's death That thy soul has God been leaving! If upon thy sailor-boy, Star of home and social joy, Far amid the wild sea-waves Where his head the tempest braves, Thou art dreaming, when thy prayer Heavenward should in faith be swelling, Canst thou hope thy God is there, If no grace be in thee dwelling? Wife, and parent, husband, child, Let not feeling be defiled By a worship that withdraws Love from those celestial Laws Which in creatures claim the heart;— There the Lord erects a throne In whose glories none have part, Where He reigns, and reigns alone! Hide our treasure, Lord, in Thee! And regenerate hearts will be, Like the ransom'd, more and more When they scan their radiant store, Bliss seraphic taught to feel While around the Lamb they bend, Chanting with impassion'd zeal,— “Glory's fount! and sinner's Friend!” WISDOM OF PRAYER. “O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh come.”—Ps. lxv. 2. Why should the reas'ning sceptic dare To stand between the Godhead and our prayer? A mental antichrist, too oft Madly presuming mind will soar aloft, And from Jehovah's nature draw A reason why we should reject his law,— That all who would Heaven's pardon claim Must clasp that mercy in Emmanuel's name. God is not changed by hearing prayer, But would be changed, if our petitions were By Him unheard; Whose page inspired Hath said, “For this My Throne shall be enquired.” Thus, end and means together meet When bows the sinner at Heaven's mercy-seat: To this God's changeless purpose tends, And with His glory our salvation blends. Avaunt! ye hell-breathed doubts, away! Morn, noon, and night, let true adorers pray; Precept, and promise, doctrine,—all To this vast privilege our being call. No saint in earth, or heaven is found, Who did not in such glorious work abound; His prayer, whatever path he trod, Drew God to man, and lifted man to God. Prayer conquers scene, and space, and time, Entreats no temple, and demands no clime, But, like an omnipresent charm Can shield the saints from all corrupting harm; Howe'er remote from genial home The surging waves of life may bid them roam. Oft riven Friendships pray afar, Each thrilling each, beneath some alien star. Elijah, Moses, Jonah, pray'd; And how those heroes of The Spirit sway'd Nature, and Providence, and Man!— As though the movements of almighty plan, However fathomless they were, Hung on the breathings of a human prayer; Or else, that He whose will is law, Were sway'd in heaven, by what on earth he saw. And mark, thou prayerless Thing of dust! If doubt thy God, and reason be thy trust, How Abram, that Elect of heaven To whom the Church's promises were given, With sixfold intercession bent Before His wrath, Th' enthroned Omnipotent! And, when the bolt was almost hurl'd, By prayer held back His thunders from the world. But oh! if pure example can Melt the cold mind of antichristian man, Behold it, in the Saviour mild, The God in flesh, the manhood undefiled: For He, by whom the worlds were made, In the hush'd midnight on the mountains pray'd, And wintry stars from their high spheres Blent their cold radiance with His awful tears! Here let us pause: His finite will Before the Infinite of heaven did fall; Though spotless, Christ was human still, And ceased not on His Father-God to call. And what but heartless sin will dare To doubt that He is moved by mighty prayer?— My Saviour wept, and watch'd, and pray'd; Be each unhallow'd thought by that o'ersway'd. And this, when worlds shall disappear, Will rock to slumber each tempestuous fear; All pangs without, all pains within Yield to its spell; and each tyrannic sin Is vanquish'd by believing prayer, Which proves God greater than our greatest care: And deep will be his hallow'd rest Who drops his burden on Emmanuel's breast. CONVICTION, AND CONFESSION. “He will reprove the world of sin ? because they believe not on me.”—John xvi. 8, 9. “O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?”—Rom. vii. 24. “Wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”—Rev. iii. 17. There was a time, when earth appear'd From each cold mist of sorrow clear'd, A landscape clothed with calm and grace, Whose flowers conceal'd the serpent's trace. Then Nature seem'd a fairy world Where beauty all its wings unfurl'd, Till soil, and sea, and sun, and sky Entranced me with their poetry. Brightness and bloom o'er objects threw The witchery of that wond'rous hue, Which makes the very ground to glow With gladness beaming hearts bestow. And as with Nature, so with life,— It seem'd with radiant magic rife, Where hearts, and homes, and friends, and smiles, Around me group'd their dearest wiles. I did not hear the booming knell, Nor let the tomb its wisdom tell; Sickness and sorrow, change and grief, Appear'd too dark for my belief. And when from Heaven's most awful book My blinded heart some utt'rance took, The God I worshipp'd was my own, Without a sceptre, law, or throne! And thus, Religion's peerless claim A sentimental lie became: It touch'd the fancy—but the heart From ruling grace beat all apart. Till He, who bowed the heavens in love, Beheld me from His shrine above, And so my sensual trance awoke, With legal Sinai's lightning-stroke. Then, dread conviction through me burst, And I sank down, accurst! accurst! No more I lived, but seem'd to die Like those who dare their God defy. Both heart and brain with horror felt Vengeance divine my being melt: The pleasure loved, grew loathsome now, And stamp'd, like Cain's, my branded brow. Creation's glories ceased to shine Upon a heart depress'd as mine; And round her fairest landscape stole The blight and blackness of my soul. Where'er I went, whate'er I saw, The haunting curse of holy law Came like my shadow;—dread and deep It quiver'd o'er my harrow'd sleep. Matter and mind, and time and space, Sun, air, and sea, with heaven's bright face, Whate'er I saw, or felt, or heard, Echoed The Law's condemning word. “Oh wretched man!” (thus breathed my groan) “The body of this death to own; As though the corpse from out its grave Were fasten'd to some living slave, I bear without, and drag within The clinging weight of woful sin!— Who can deliver, and my soul Rescue from this abhorr'd control?” My virtues, now, to vices turn'd, As more enlighten'd reason learn'd The pureness of that perfect Law, Which sees what Conscience never saw. Eager with light from God's own eye It can the shades of sin descry: Nor could one pulse of feeling play That throbs not in its searching ray. And thus, gay sinner! down to dust Be all thy tow'ring virtues thrust; The law of God is legal death By guilt inhaled at every breath. Go, cultivate a grief divine; A noble wretchedness be thine; A heaven-born pang, like Paul's profound,— The bleeding of the spirit's wound. Nor fancy, as we Godward rise And grace soars nearer to the skies, Our sainted calm will deeper grow, As if we found true heaven below. Insatiate conscience, strong and stern Will evermore this wisdom learn, That our perfection is to prove Imperfect reigns man's purest love. Oh! bless we God, for gracious tears, For sunken hopes, and shadowy fears; Those Hearts are not for glory meant Who feel no glorious discontent: Enough for souls this truth to gain,— In Christ alone we live and reign; And all who would perfection find Must seek it in the Saviour's mind. BELIEVER'S DESTINED WORK. “Ye are the salt of the earth ? ye are the light of the world ? let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—Matt. v. 13, 14, 16. The World exults to crucify The truth it loathes to feel; And thus, all time repeats the Cross, And Christians must through shame and loss Maintain a martyr-zeal. They cannot on this impious earth Expect a brighter doom Than that the Prince of Glory bore, When He rebuked the world of yore, And gain'd a borrow'd tomb. But not for this, with craven hearts And love of selfish ease Shrink they from conflict, or the crowd, And in dull cloister bent and bow'd Enjoy a bad release. Alas! for their religious mock Whose creed is Self disguised; Our sacrament of second birth Anoints us to contend with earth;— Have we our unction prized? The heavenliness of blissful calm In some poetic shade, Where nature is the nurse of thought, And all seems with religion fraught And for devotion made; For this indeed, mild spirits yearn, And long for dove-like wings Away to flee, and be at rest With God and angels purely blest Above terrestrial things. Hence, most divine to musing hearts When sick of toil and strife, Monastic bowers of peace and prayer Where time intrudes no fev'rish care To fret the saintly life. But, where is then the martyr's will?— That oath by which we vow'd Under Christ's banner, in His name, To battle for His crown and claim Amid earth's warring crowd? Mistaken victims of themselves! Who violate their creed And fly with recreant heart and will, Instead of facing stern and still The front of battle's need; 'Tis not by flight or fear we gain The jewell'd crown of bliss; But by enduring unto death, And battling to our latest breath, We claim reward like this. The world is dark, the world is dead, Corruption broods in all; Those painted splendours which appear Glitter like spangles on a bier, And worse than gloom appal. Hero for heaven, baptised and brave, The vow is on thee,—fight! Full at the Fiend, the flesh, and world Be all thy weapon'd graces hurl'd, And God shall guard the right. Or, if thou wilt the mystic words Of “light” and “salt” translate,— Then, shine by contrast in the dark, And by correction probe and mark The evils of our state. We live in evil times; and tongues Against the truth contend; When Motive, Principle, and Power, Around us in rebellion tower And loud their challenge send. Then, soldier, put thine armour on And wield thy weapons bright; With spear and breastplate, sword and shield, Thus panoplied,—go, take the field And foremost fall, or fight! How can we “shine,” unless we face A world of guilt and gloom? Or, be like salt's corrective force, By hallow'd deed, or high discourse, If life itself entomb? Earth needs the grace, and wants the beams Embodied grace imparts, When worldlings view a valiant band Maintain with hope and heart and hand The creed of sainted hearts. A cloister's gloom, a cowl, and cell May oft a mind conceal, Where rancour, pride, and envy reign, While Passion gnaws a viler chain Than fettered world-slaves feel. Lord of the Church! of creeds, and souls, Thy wisdom make our own, Not of, but in, this world to be, And hear the summons, “Follow me,” From manger to the throne. Contention with a godless world,— Here is our law of life: The salt must spread, the light must shine, Unless we cross the will divine And sink from duteous strife. 'Tis easy when the flesh-born will In solitude retires, To choose the calm of constant prayer, And thus avoid the fretting care A public fate inspires. But, social is the cause of God; And Christ demands a creed That shall not seek monastic shade Of all but righteous self afraid,— But front the dreadest need. True salt and sunlight make us, Lord! Thy Spirit forms them both; So may we best Thy word obey, And rev'rence thus by night and day Our sacramental oath. The crowded world Thy Sceptre rules; And Thou not less art there, Than in the lull of lone retreat; And saints may thy pure guidance meet In duties ev'ry-where. But while we seek to shine and act, In all our words and ways Thy veil, Humility! bestow, And over us protection throw, Lest we aspire for praise. The work, but not the worker, seen,— Behold! a heaven-drawn plan For saints to lead their life in God; Such path a Saviour's virtue trod And made it bright for man. SACREDNESS OF FLOWERS. “Consider the lilies.”—Matt. vi. 28. “Glorious beauty is a fading flower.”—Isa. xxviii. 1. “All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.”—1 Pet. i. 24. Ye silent poems! which from nature's book Warble of Eden to our inward ear, Filling the thoughtful eyes that on ye look With the soft mystery of a sacred tear, Not the chaste stars, whose placid eyes salute The musing gaze of man's poetic mind, Throned in their skyey radiance,—dare dispute The spell ye wield o'er every heart refined. Since God, from Whose ideal wealth of thought All that is bright, or beautiful, or fair, By shaping wisdom into form was wrought And thus committed unto sun and air, Made the wild flowers like earth-sprung stars to shine With gleams of almost sacramental power,— Dull is the heart which hails no tone divine When these accost him from their vernal bower! Nor dream, that He who marks a sparrow's flight Forgets the dew-fed darlings of the Spring; Angels are not more surely in His sight Than the soft flowers which breeze and brightness bring. For such adjustment doth His hand ordain Amid all forms and faculties to be, That 'tween the snow-drop and vast earth must reign Proportions pure as Science loves to see. Were the huge world one atom more or less In majesty, from centre to the pole, The flowers might lose their bending loveliness, Like living sympathies with nature's Whole. And in man's world, where sin and woe prevail, Harshness, and heat, and hurry so abound, How sweet the hush of some sequester'd dale Where slaves grow freemen upon nature's ground! There can we hold communion meek and mild With flowers, which deck some grove, or vernal wood, And guard their innocence as undefiled As when their greeting Maker call'd them “good.” Orphans of Eden, their parental soil Has long been wither'd, and by weeds o'errun; While burden'd Manhood, with a brow of toil, Endures the desert, and outworks the sun; But these, like babes whose mother we deplore, Still do their budding features love to keep A soft sad trace of paradise no more, And waken memories that well may weep. Of old, before the God Incarnate came, Oft did high song, and sentiment, and art Borrow from flowers an ever-beauteous fame Which feeds the mind, and purifies the heart. But since the hour a lily blush'd, and bow'd Its head of grace beneath Emmanuel's smile, Divine and deep associations crowd The dreaming soul which o'er them bends awhile. “Behold the lilies of the field, and learn From their sweet lives, who neither toil, nor spin,”— Well may such consecrating words return, And waken truths whose echoes sleep within! And might we shape one hallow'd dream of Him Whose life was pure, mysterious, deep, and lone, Whose glory to the wing-veil'd Seraphim Beamed from the Cross, more wondrous than His Throne,— Thought may imagine hours of worldless calm, When all unwatch'd, Messiah's human soul Found in far meads a meditative balm, And in bright flowers some beautiful control. As God, He made them, and as Man, admired The blooming product of His lovely power; And oft may genius, by their grace inspired, Read silent poems in a sacred flower. INGRATITUDE TO ANGELS. “He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”—Ps. xci. 11. And must we, now the God-man reigns In regions where no senses roam, Refuse to hear angelic strains Float through the heart, and fill our home? Have Seraphim quite ceased to walk Man's world, and with man's spirit talk? 'Tis true indeed, nor eye nor ear Their shapes discern, nor know their voice; But still they haunt a human sphere, To make elected souls their choice; And round them may bright Angels be, Though nothing but blind earth they see. Oh! never till the clouds of time Are rent by awful death from man, And he from yonder heaven sublime Shall look back where dark life began, Will gather'd saints in glory know What blessings men to angels owe. This earth is but a thorny wild, A tangled maze where griefs abound, By sorrow vex'd, by sin defiled, Where foes and fiends our walks surround; But does not dread Jehovah say, Angelic guardians line the way? It is not when gigantic woe, Or crisis unforeseen assails Our earthly doom, that most we glow To feel heroic faith prevails, When perill'd by the bitter shower Temptation pours in sorrow's hour. The precipice men rarely find; On us no avalanche may fall; But petty woes distract the mind And take sweet temper from us all; As some by thickets are o'erthrown, Whose feet escaped the crushing stone. Mean trifles our true dangers make, Weak'ning the spirit unawares; And tiny griefs would often break The heart unbow'd by pond'rous cares, Did not our guardian angels glide, And watch, unseen, the naked side. Some pebble in our daily path, The little stone we scarce behold A world of secret ruin hath, O'er which might trip the brave and bold,— Should not blest angels' saving arms Upbear the soul from sudden harms. And moods are felt no words define, When earth and heaven appear to meet, While faith half hears a tone divine From out yon orbs of Glory greet Each praying heart, and placid soul Which echoes to such sweet control. When gracious beams of holy light From spheres of radiance seem to play, And from lone hours of suff'ring night Melt half their haunted gloom away,— Our perill'd souls prompt Angels see And hover by the bended knee. Sickness and sorrow, too, may have Ethereal Hosts whom none perceive, Whose golden wings around us wave When all alone men seem to grieve; And while we sigh, or shed the tear, Their sympathies may flutter near. Or, by some law to man unknown, Their spells may o'er us act and steal, And strengthen Faith upon her throne, When fury-passions make us feel How Self and Sin would monarchs be, And give the law to Deity! Thus, human Life from them may take Some moral tinge, or mental hue, Which not till dust the soul forsake Elected saints will value true:— Before God's throne, and only then These guardians will be thank'd by men. FOLLOW CHRIST. “Jesus saith unto them, Follow me; and ? they followed Him.”—Matt. iv. 18—20. The sheep who know the shepherd's tone Delight to hear his voice; His guiding way becomes their own, His wish their willing choice: So is it with regenerate Souls, Whose love the law of grace controls; Let but the Shepherd of the Spirit call,— Like echoes they reply, and leave their noblest all! So was it in the Church of old When, walking by the sea, The Lord of Mercy did behold The twin elect of Galilee, Two fishers there, who cast the net The produce of the lake to get; But when that “Follow Me!” from Christ was heard, The laden ships they left, responsive to His word. So is it now; if Hearts be true To Him whose shepherd-cry Will never cause that soul to rue Which dares itself deny, And lives for Christ, where'er it roam;— Serene abroad, resign'd at home, By crowded mart, or in resounding street Where all the mingled tides of sin and struggle meet. Life need not seek monastic cell, Nor yearn for cloister'd shades; Nor sigh for some Arcadian dell, And green poetic glades Where blissful Quiet can enjoy The bower of peace without alloy; But rather rest where Providence doth say, “Move in thine orbit here, for Wisdom chose the way.” They are not meek who fretful ask, Or pine for distant spheres; Let heaven be view'd in ev'ry task And that will soothe our fears! We should not e'en by thought rebel; For God works all things wise and well, And for each being doth unroll the plan Eternity decreed, before the hills began. To sigh for some romantic spot Of solitude and peace, And clasp in dreams a perfect lot Where care and sorrow cease,— To God must breathe of discontent, Howe'er with sainted feeling blent; Our proper sphere in providence must be Where Christ in spirit comes, and utters, “Follow Me!” Localities alone confine The gilded mocks of earth; But they who bear a charm divine Which seals our second birth, High o'er the world's bewilder'd sphere The still small voice of Christ can hear: And so, when Mammon tempts, or Belial reigns, Bound at the Master's voice, and burst their venal chains. Thus to the publican there came A “Follow Me,” which drew His heart to hear That holy Name Which heaven proclaim'd the true; All circumstance, and scene, and lot, The den, the dungeon, or the cot,— Let but the voice of duty call us there, And Faith may hallow each by watchfulness and prayer. And hence may those who dwell Far from the hurried mart, Where sylvan homes with quiet spell Attune some thinking heart, When haply through harsh cities loud They wind amid the toiling crowd, Or through damp courts and dusky lanes of woe See haggard Want and Age, with shrunken features go,— Oh! let them not presume to say That there, 'mid vexing strife, No saintly Minds can muse or pray, Or consecrate a life To heaven-born cares, and hopes of bliss Which lift them o'er a doom like this:— For though the heart in rustic dreams will roam, It glories in the truth, that Faith can find a home Wherever love and prayer abide: And hence, dear Lord, may we Remember that calm Voice which cried, To Levi,—“Follow Me!” Whate'er the pathway life must tread, Around us be Thy graces spread, And thus no time, nor toil, nor space, nor scene To hide Thy Word from us will ever intervene. If such Thy will, by wooded streams, Or vales of blissful calm, Where the deep hush of holy dreams Inspires unearthly balm, Where from green hills the gladden'd eyes Look speechless hymns beyond the skies,— If there embower'd, Thou doom'st our lot to be, Lord of the landscape fair! we glow to “follow” Thee. Or, if Thy regal Word decide, That cities throng'd and loud Which billow with the restless tide Of life's tumultuous crowd, Should be our peopled deserts, where Unechoed hearts conceal each care,— Still may our souls by meek compliance find, The ever-present Christ an anchor for the mind. Love need not quit the humblest call, But calmly work and wait; For safety dwells where duties all Attend our mortal state;— Messiah did not die to give Each heart the choice where faith would live; But this He grants to all who seek for grace,— The guidance of His truth, and glory of His face. Yes, “Follow Me!” be this the word, The motto of our lives; Morn, noon, and night, let such be heard, When Sin or Satan strives; Should Passion rage, or Pride begin, Or treason-banners rise within, In all we feel, or fancy, do or dare, Let Thy mild “Follow Me,” pursue us every where, Great Captain of the meek and good! Whose crimson guilt and stain Shall never, through Thine awful blood, Assail their souls again, In self-denial, grief, or loss, In all we have of care and cross, Thy hand of mercy out of heaven bestow, And let us feel its grasp, where'er our footsteps go. Thy path was one of pain and grief, A sacrifice of love; Nor God, nor angel brought relief From bowers of bliss above; We ask not then poetic fields Where life all bloom and brightness yields; But this we seek,—a soul from murmurs free, Whose heaven on earth it proves, in all to follow Thee. NAME WITHOUT NATURE. “Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.”—Rev. iii. 1. “Many will say unto me, in that day, Lord! Lord! have we not prophesied in Thy name? ? Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you.”—Matt. vii. 22, 23. When plaintive knells peal sadness o'er the wind, And echoes haunt the mind With thoughts, whose voiceless depths of awe infold Meanings which are not told, Dark fears from hush'd eternity arise Too deep, except for sighs: Men dare not speak it, but they ponder this, Where wings the parted Soul?—to agony, or bliss? And solemn terrors, blent with truths profound, In these vast words abound, Which tell what imitation's power achieves, When formal man believes That he in Christ by nature, as by name, His own can truly claim,— While far as earth from heaven his spirit lives On that base food alone, the power of pleasure gives. And marvel we, such midnight error can So darken over man, That he a hollow lie for truth mistakes, And life for death forsakes? And thus, while dead in selfishness and sin, Doth never gaze within The deeper fountains of his soul to prove, Whether from earth they rise, or stream from grace above? The mystery may here its web unwind,— Self-love deludes the blind; And in the blindness of bad hearts they see A shade of miscall'd deity; And, like their god, a false religion seems Reflecting back their dreams; And so, from year to year they live, and die, Feeling their souls secure as angels in the sky! Void of all grace, perceptive reason can So educate the man, And unto plastic mind and morals give Those forms, by which men live In seeming concord with what Heaven requires: Yet God alone inspires Life from The Spirit, and that sacred love Whereby all saints on earth, are yet in soul, above. Thus can the outworks of religious grace Impress their lovely trace On creed and conduct, character, and all The world-slaves “nature” call; Reason and Sentiment may both forbear To doubt what texts declare; And ritual zeal so mechanise the soul That much the Church decrees, may wield a due control. The beauty of unblemish'd morals, too, May guard its vestal hue, Nor vulgar passions by their vicious reign Cast o'er the law a stain; And thus complete in all mere sense admires, Who doubts, that faith inspires So fair a specimen of social truth Beheld in wintry age, or seen in vernal youth? Love will not criticise a brother-soul; And when the death-knells roll Their dirge-like cadence, while the living sigh To think, how soon we die! Oh, marvel not, blind Charity conceives That he who this world leaves With such a sanctity around him spread, Hath up to Glory's throne by angel-bands been led. Still, dare we not Truth's warning tone forget, For, ah! 'tis needed yet: “Lord,” on our lips most orthodox may be, And none our danger see; And yet not Christ, but our own will preside O'er passion's inward tide, O'er thought and feeling, motive and desire Which from the outer-sense to secret life retire. Yes, we may prophesy and preach, And high distinction reach; O'er our mute dust pale monuments arise, Or throne us in the skies, While the loud trumpet of a world-wide fame Rings through all hearts our name; And when rapt eyes our sculptured praises read, They glisten with the thought,—here lies a saint indeed! And yet our soul's eternity, the while, Unlit by glory's smile, Though canonising Praise adorns our tomb, May be immersed in gloom; And realms of horror round that darkness burn, Where hypocrites must learn How vast a gulf between profession lies And that celestial life which moulds us for the skies! But, Lord, while we in self-abasement lie Beneath Thy searching eye, Home to the centre bare the soul within Where hides a bosom-sin, Which oft amid pure seemliness of life With secret lust is rife: Yea, some, professing to uphold Thy throne, Have cast all devils out, except their spirit's own! From such delusion, God! our conscience save, Which to the very grave And e'en beyond it,—to the Judge on high Extends the cheating lie!— That spell of Satan, whence a worldling dreams He is the all he seems, And dares not search his own deluded heart, Till Christ shall rend the veil, by that dread word, “Depart!” THE HOMELESS ONE. “The Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.” Matt. viii. 20. Could Fancy, in some dream sublime, With circumstance have clothed the time When God incarnate should appear, To roll the curse from earth's dark sphere, With what a pomp of heaven-bright rays Would she have circled round His ways!— Angel, and harp, and seraphim Would all have been foretold for Him. Sun, moon, and star, and sky and sea, Would each have felt a sympathy: Some impulse, like a throbbing awe, Through Earth had thrill'd, when Christ she saw. But, not in Glory's pall He came; Nor did an earthquake's throb proclaim The world's Creator was a child, Born in our flesh, but undefiled. No fameless offspring of the poor On mountain bleak, or barren moor, Was ever rock'd on mother's breast, To outward sense, so little blest As yonder Babe Divine appears, Baptised by Mary's virgin tears,— Those pearl-drops of the heart which flow While mothers o'er a first-born glow. And as the inns no room afford To cradle earth's infantine Lord, But in the manger's welcome cold The Virgin must her Child enfold,— In this, prophetic shades we find Of that dark lot, by heaven design'd Hereafter to o'ershade The Man, In working out redemption's plan. Grandeurs, indeed, to Christ belong; But shine they not in bardic song, Such as the lyric choirs of earth Are wont to chant for Hero's worth. Ne'er did our world such meekness view, Such self-oblivion, vast and true; His very majesty was mild,— The Man of Sorrows never smiled. The fox his cave, the bird his nest, But where His glorious head to rest My Saviour had not!—doom'd to roam From earth to heaven without a home. Oh, miracle! which dazzles thought,— With all the wealth of Godhead fraught That He, who died the world to save, Was buried in a borrow'd grave! And yet, beneath that bland disguise What glory in suspension lies!— Jehovah, in our manhood shrined, Is mock'd by unappall'd mankind. But He, by whom yon worlds were made, Whose will their huge foundations laid, Though matter, motion, time, and sense Were slaves to His omnipotence, Repress'd His Godhead; nor allow'd Full beams to flash from out the cloud; For at the glance of one dread ray The Universe had shrunk away! For Him no monuments arise; No motto'd pillars seek the skies; Unlike the earth-gods fame admires, His awful life no World inspires. Alone, beyond all loneliness, Which e'er a burden'd soul could press, Emmanuel's heart through toil and tears Went beating on its destined years. Martyrs are found, whose bosoms bleed, When by mysterious Heaven decreed In the hush'd depths of their lone heart To bear untold some venom'd dart; But neither saint, nor angel could Uncurtain that veil'd solitude Where Christ alone, unstain'd by sin, Baffled the powers of Hell, within. And thus, eternity nor time, Nor sorrowing earth, nor heaven sublime, Except in Christ,—did ever see A Soul without a sympathy, And wilt thou, ere thy course be run, Betake thee to the Homeless one? Then, sinner, count the mighty cost!— To thee the world is blind and lost; Not rashly bear His awful name; Nor dream that fortune, bliss, or fame, Or aught that hero-worship loves, The Lord of meekness e'er approves. In fasting, solitude, and fears, Through buried pangs, and hidden tears, Unecho'd, and by most, unknown, Prepare, like Christ, to live alone. Yet oh, within thee, dark and deep When thy crush'd thought retires to weep, And harshly cold, its iron heart The world presents to all thou art, Then, think of Him! and back recall The Homeless, Who was Lord of all; A God with angels round the throne, Too poor to call the grave His own. Pillow in prayer thine aching breast On Him, who had not where to rest His head on earth; but Who in heaven Can feel thy heart, and cry—forgiven! FIRST SOUL IN HEAVEN. “By faith Abel ? obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: he being dead, yet speaketh.”—Heb. xi. 4. “No man could learn that song but ? the redeemed.”—Rev. xiv. 3. In hush'd eternity alone Before all creatures were, Jehovah held His awful throne Unworshipp'd by a prayer. There was no space, nor scene, nor time, Nor aught by names we call; But, center'd in Himself sublime Was God, the All in All! But through eternity there ran A thrill of coming change, And lustrous Shapes of life began Around His Throne to range. Radiant with rapture, pure as bright, Angelic myriads rise, And glow and glisten in the light Of God's approving eyes. In volumed waves of golden sound Roll from celestial lyres Those swelling chants, which peal around From new-created choirs. But, hark! amid the shining throng Of Shapes who arch their wings, A single Voice another song With mortal cadence sings: Alone he seems, and chants apart In unexpected notes A music, where the grateful heart In strains of feeling floats: A beauteous Soul! whose seraph brow Is bright with glory's hue,— Lo, Angels pause to hear him now Their harping praise outdo. Their choral rapture swell'd as deep As purity could pour; But they, who have not learn'd to weep, May never God adore With such a burst of whelming love As Earth's first martyr sang, When, glory to the Lord above! The voice of Abel rang. Angelic harps their key-note found In God, as great and good: But Abel's life-pulse beat and bound As only sinner's could. “Worthy the Lamb! who shall be slain; Redemption crowns my song: Ye seraphim! your notes retain, But these to me belong.” Thus might the primal Soul who came Forth from its bleeding clay, Kindle the heavens with His bright name, Who is our Truth, and Way. And with that blissful song he blent A humbling depth of tone, Which to the ransom'd harper lent A music all its own. Angels for bliss and being sang Their ecstasies on high; But how the heavens with wonder rang When Man awoke the sky With that new song, Redemption gave To Abel's pardon'd soul! Till angels ceased their wings to wave, Nor let their chorus roll, But listen'd with entrancèd ears To that bright martyr's strain, Whose notes were born of banish'd fears And breathed of ended pain. But from the hour when rescued man Enter'd within the veil, And heaven's delighted host began To list Redemption's tale, Myriads of blood-wash'd souls have flown Where the first spirit went Till he, who once hymn'd Christ alone, Is now with numbers blent. Each nation, kindred, home, and clime Helps to increase the throng, Making the heavens grow more sublime With Earth's redemption-song. Each minute, guardian angels mount With some new soul on high, And hear it, close to Glory's fount, Deepen that endless cry,— “Salvation! through the bleeding grace Of God's incarnate Son, Whose merit for a banded race A more than Eden won.” And louder, louder, yet will grow That song before the Throne, As added saints set free from woe Shall make the strain their own. Lord! grant that we on earth begin To tune the heart's deep lyre, And by prophetic notes within Anticipate the choir, Who ever round Thee chant, and sing The song no angels can,— “Hail! Prophet, Priest, and destined King Before the world began, “Prostrate beneath Thy face to fall And cast our crowns before Thee, Oh Thou, The Everlasting All, Be this our brightest glory!” GUILTY FEARS. “O thou of little faith! wherefore didst thou doubt.” Matt. xiv. 31. Around us moves this magic world With all appeals of blended power; And o'er our heads unfurl'd The heavens, which change each hour. Above, beneath, where'er we gaze On sky, or soil, or living sea, Some chord is touch'd, which plays And thrills, O God! from Thee. Divine as deep the eloquence Through form and fact creation wields, When through the veil of sense A solemn vision yields Stern truths,—which teach the soul to pray, And ponder them with deepest awe; Till conscience own the sway Of heaven's interior law. For though in calm, the poet sees Rich Beauty reigning like a queen, And grace from flowers and trees Bedecks some fairy scene; Yet Nature hath her moods of ire, Deep thunders of prophetic tone, Lightnings of ghastly fire, And winds with conscious moan. Darkness and thunder, wave and wind,— Amid them let the godless think, And soon the awe-struck mind Will in dejection sink. For, oh, that echo faint and broken Of God, the holy and the just, Within us like a token Awaken will,—and must! And then, judicial conscience yearns To know where God and man can meet? And with this question burns, “Is there a mercy seat?” But what can mere creation preach? Is mercy mirror'd on the sky? Can all earth's glories reach The source of one deep sigh? Is there a grace to heal our sin, Atonement for the guilt-stain'd hearts?— Around, above, within, No answer earth imparts. In health, and hours of reckless glee, We mould a god from mortal smiles, And thus, from judgment free, Enjoy our transient wiles. Still conscience is not murder'd quite; But in some gloom of anguish rolls Its challenge for God's right Athwart our echoing souls. Then, to the root of moral life Our being rocks with more than fear; And in that harrowing strife The Judge seems drawing near! Hence, like disciples on the deep When yawning billows o'er them swept, While lapp'd in lovely sleep The Lord calm slumber kept, Our souls are in tempestuous fright, Our bark of hope is sinking fast, And death's eternal night Seems all around us cast. Then, fear we, Lord! and learn at length What saints must feel before they die,— A sinner has no strength Except to grace he fly. “Oh, little faith,”—alas, how true! Our pagan fears in calm and storm Darken from love's own view Thy Mercy's present form. And thus, 'mid promises divine, And with the wealth of Godhead stored, Like orphans, Christians pine, As if they had no Lord! Shame on our sunken hearts, and base, That men like creedless orphans live, Though God redeem'd our race With all a God could give. Oh, had we faith, though earth and sky To second chaos were confounded, Christ would not hear the cry,— “By death are we surrounded!” But, calm, as was the Saviour's brow Who slept amid the thund'ring wave, Each soul would prove him now Mighty to shield and save. Rebuke then, Lord! not waves and winds, But rather raise our blush of shame, That men with heathen minds Can bear Thy blessed Name. Anchor of Souls! in life and death Though loud the storms of anguish be, May Love, with latest breath, Her haven seek in Thee. JESUS TEMPTED. “Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.”—Matt. iv. 1. And wert Thou by the prompting Spirit led Through desert lone, to face Satanic power, Oh second Adam! our anointed Head,— To balk the demon in his blackest hour? One moment, by baptismal waves we hear From opening skies deep melody descend, And drink that Voice with reverential fear Which hail'd Thee, Son of God, whom Grace did send: The next,—and Thou art in yon homeless wild Fasting and foodless, with no eye to see How the lost angel tempts Thine undefiled Manhood, to break the bond of Deity. 'Twas even so: and if when Satan threw A fiendish shade of subtlety and hate, By tempting wickedness of words untrue Into the heart of man's primeval state, A mystery darkens round the deepest mind Which ponders o'er that scene with prayerful thought, How can we dream (unless by sin struck blind) A tempted Christ, with. less of mystery fraught? Thus doth our Athanasian symbol teach A truth sublime which deep in Godhead dwells, Something beyond a soaring thought to reach, Surmounting all that wingèd reason tells,— How in Emmanuel God and Man unite Both natures true, in properties and powers; The first retain'd its uncreated light, The second, sin except, was weak as ours. In act quiescent, though by Godhead there, Divinity did not the man withdraw; And thus obedient down to weeping prayer The Infinite became, by finite law. So may we read, with simple hearts and pure, How thus between the Darkness and the Light A conflict reign'd; nor let cold science lure Our souls from faith in that mysterious fight. No dream it was; no parable, no trance; Nor mental ecstasy, which rapt the soul Beyond the bounds where time and space advance Their true conditions, or their just control: Close to the record simply may we cleave; Then, each temptation will to man impart Wonders that whelm no reason to believe, And awing wisdom which improves the heart. Tempted by Satan, lo, the Adam first Yielded, and fell beneath a boundless lie; And by his fall condemn'd mankind were curst, In whose one death all generations die! But when again the Prince of Evil would A second Adam likewise have assail'd,— Based on eternity, our Rock withstood And humanly o'er sin and hell prevail'd. Vainly to crush Him thrice the Tempter brought The magic fulness of infernal skill; Nothing which sense or inward feeling wrought, Assail'd the Holy One with shade of ill. Far o'er the fiercest hunger faith arose; No pride of life His meekness could o'erwhelm; And Kingdoms of the world, as painted shows, His heart rejected from its holy realm. He came to suffer, long before He reign'd, And home to God our human will to bring; Thus, no temptation from the demon stain'd That perfect Virtue, saints and angels sing. Hail, Son of Mary! Arch-Elect of heaven, Victim Divine, whose blood redeem'd our fall, Conquer'd by grace, to Thee the world is given,— Wield Thy love-sceptre, and subdue it all! VOICE OF THOSE NO MORE. “He being dead, yet speaketh.”—Heb. xi. 4. Our Fathers, where be they, The guides of vernal youth, Who taught our infant lips to pray, And vow'd the heart to truth? The Prophets, who foretold What life's worn scene would be, And bade us in our God behold The hopes which make us free? All fleeted by, and fled To orbs of bliss unknown; Their dust is with the countless dead, And we,—must walk alone. But in time's weary track Of sorrow, change, and care, How oft their words come rolling back, And breathe us into prayer! Oh, little did we think When their hoar'd wisdom spake, How soon our lofty hopes would sink, And life's gay bubble break! We call'd them gloomy seers, Too boding, dull, and sad; And when their eyes were dimm'd with tears, Our own smiled ever glad. They warn'd us of the world, Gave to each rose its thorn, And when false hopes their wings unfurl'd, Spake words which seem'd forlorn. They bade us walk with God, And, Christ-like, bear the cross, Learning true wisdom in the rod, And love from earthly loss. And have our lives gainsay'd The warning truth and word Which once, ere Time these hearts betray'd, Approving conscience stirr'd? Ah, no!—in grief and gloom, Their counsels and their cares Accost us from their distant tomb, And show the truth was theirs. Though mortal was their breath, Immortal breathes the mind; For how can That be sunk in death, Whose wisdom rules mankind? Dead prophets, then, seem nigh, And round us dwell and reign; And all who in the Saviour die, Shall hear those seers again. SINFULNESS OF SIN. “Sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.” Rom. vii. 13. Sin colours all we do and prize, And, like our shadow, ne'er departs; E'en when we sleep, its blackness lies In spirit brooding o'er our hearts. The cleansing grace of Blood Divine Alone can wash the stain away, “So let it bathe this heart of mine!”— Believers thus for ever pray. Sin struck the moral root of Man And poison'd there the branches too; From Adam down to us it ran, And venoms all we think and do. Still, not in earth, but heaven above Rebellion first its flag unfurl'd, When God's bright Angel left his love, A fiend became, and sought our world. O mystery! too deep for all Except for Truth's omniscient eye, That one in heaven from faith might fall, Whom nothing from without could try. Yet refuge in this thought we find, That sin no perfect substance is; But mere negation, bad and blind, Which cankers man and mortal bliss. Dark paradox of will perverse, Self-worship forms the secret ground Where Sin begets that boundless curse, Hearts without God have ever found. Self-pref'rence frames a hell within, Eternity in seed is there; And death and darkness thence begin The torment souls undone must share. How sin commenced, vain reason tries To speculate, till thought grows wild; But modest faith this truth can prize,— That God is pure, though man defiled. Sole Teacher of all saving truth! Divine Convincer of our need, Guardian of age, and Guide of youth, Under the Cross we learn our creed: Sin blasted with primeval blight Our first estate in Eden's bowers, Cover'd creation o'er with night, And crush'd her prospects, and her powers. And since that most stupendous fall, Matter and mind, with secret groan Have ceased not for their God to call, Like orphans left to sigh alone. All pangs, and penalties, and pains, Sickness and sorrow, grief and care, Where ruin frowns, or anguish reigns,— The sinfulness of sin is there. The babe who dies; the tomb which opes For buried joys, or broken hearts; Each leaf that falls from wither'd hopes As friend on friend from earth departs,— What prove they all, but seal and sign, How sin hath havock'd earth and man, And, as the foe of law divine, Merits an everlasting ban? But seek we this sad truth to know How sin by virtual root can be A deicide, who strikes a blow Which aims at awful Deity? Then, look we to supernal Grace, Almighty Love in flesh unveil'd, Whose worth restored our sunken race To heights beyond what thought hath scaled. Did grateful awe His form attend? Or, round Him adorations fall, And with encrowning anthem blend In one loud burst,—“Hail! Lord of all!” Alas! the world an atheist proved; His life became embodied woe, And He whom God supremely loved Was hated, worse than fiends below. Sin nail'd Him to the felon's tree, Marr'd His meek face, and spear'd His side; Nor was one sigh of sympathy Breathed o'er Him, when the Man-God died! Well might Creation feel affright, And her dread anguish seem to say The sun could not endure that sight, But veil'd its brow, and look'd away. Yet man, the sinner, does not shake, Recoil nor shudder, groan nor weep; And while the very dead awake, His heart retains its iron sleep! Lord of the soul! while thus we find Ourselves in all the Past hath done, Teach the bad conscience of the blind, Of spirits all Thou art the Sun. In Thy pure lustre, sin appears A contrast fell to man and God; And makes us tremble at the tears Which gush'd where bleeding Mercy trod. Religion thus atonement brings When faith and fear in one combine; While purity from pardon springs, And proves them both indeed divine. WORLD OF SPIRITS. “Give place: the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.”—Matt. ix. 24. “God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”—Matt. xxii. 32. “To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”—Luke xxiii. 43. Men are not dead because they die, From outward sense receding, But where extends no mortal eye A spirit-life are leading: In some vast orb, whose unveil'd glories shine, They wait the pealing of the trump divine. What, though the slaves of tyrant sense, Wild Hearts, with sorrow blind, Dare catechise Omnipotence As though it mock'd mankind, And tempt some daring Sadducee to say “On life unseen can Reason dart her ray?” Yet, just as reason sense can lift Into some higher sphere, So can pure faith, heaven's peerless gift, O'er reason's known career Soar on wing'd thoughts,—and bid rapt feelings roam In dreams immortal round the Spirit's home. That spirit-home! that clime of Souls, The palace of the Blest, Where neither storm nor shadow rolls Athwart the halcyon breast, Oh, there embower'd, unbodied saints repose, And each pure heart with placid virtue glows. They are not dead, whose bodies die, Commingling with cold earth; For soul is man's eternity And hath such godlike worth, That no corruption makes its pulse to pause; Nor can mere death arrest its mighty laws. Created once, it lives, and lives For ever, and for ever! The God of souls a fiat gives That flesh from it may sever, But round itself no trance sepulchral steals, And when unearth'd, diviner impulse feels. The life men touch, and see, and taste, Is but organic show; And onward as wing'd moments fleet Our organs weaker grow; But character enfolds eternal doom, Bearing a life which breathes beyond the tomb. And might some parted soul return Back from the viewless state, Our yearning minds would meekly learn What voiceless wonders wait The flesh-deliver'd, who, from bondage free, Fly to that Hades God proclaims to be. Secrets of glory might disclose Their rich contents to man; And truths beyond what Learning knows Or Science ever can,— Might then illuminate with earthless gleams Darkness which makes us tremble in our dreams! But He, who is of life and death Puissant Lord and King, And portions out all human breath, Forbids the Dead to bring Intelligence from that far world unknown, To whose veil'd wonders countless souls have flown. Six thousand years have almost roll'd Their human waves along, Since Death, the uncontroll'd, Hath triumph'd o'er the strong, The weak and bad, the beautiful and brave, And made the earth-scene one enormous grave. And yet, of all our sumless dead Not one hath back return'd To soothe some heart which inly bled, And for this secret burn'd,— To understand, how Spirits think and act, And what the glories which the dead attract? In vain may restless minds intreat, Or for such knowledge groan; Silence before the Mercy-seat Befits the faith we own, When Hearts bereaved a parted soul pursue, And seek to learn what martyrs never knew: Oft in the hush of holy night, In shades of solemn grief When bow'd beneath some awful blight, With none to bring relief, How have we sigh'd to see that viewless State Where dead Immortals for their glory wait! But, ah, the Universe is dumb To each high-breathèd prayer; From earth and heaven no answers come, But echo murmurs “Where?” When lonesome Thinkers in the churchyard cry, “Where rest the souls whose bodies round us lie?” But, calm thee, riven Heart! lie still; Nor wise beyond The Word Attempt to prove, lest haughty will To Christ should be preferr'd; Enough to know, that all in heaven who trust God shall awaken from sepulchral dust. They “are not dead, but sleeping,”— Bright words of balm and grace! To Anguish worn, and weeping Above some marble face, When placid death has closed the silken lid And from our hearts the soulless glances hid. But in that hour of deepest trance While bend we o'er the dead, And into realms of thought advance Where Scripture hath not led, The calm seraphic each white feature wears Seems to embody what The Lord declares When death a transient “sleep” He calls; And thus from hearts half-breaking Rolls back the cloud which flesh appals, And prophesies the waking Soon to begin!—when Time's last trumpet rolls The blast that summons bodies back to souls. Meanwhile, though “earth to earth” Be o'er their temples cried, The souls who shared a second birth No dust and darkness hide: Wafted by angels to immertal bowers, They muse in Paradise, with conscious powers. Beyond such creed faith dares not go, Nor speculate on more; True wisdom loves her sphere to know, Nor lets the heart run o'er. In aimless dreams, which cannot love inspire, But mock the fancy with a lurid fire. When Laz'rus back to life was brought, He breathed not what he saw; As though oblivion's spell had wrought, Or some celestial law The lip restrain'd, and lock'd in silence all The shrouded wonders which the dead befall. And that young maid of Judah's race Whom Christ to earth restored, When life's glad bloom inspired her face, And she whom Love deplored, Clasp'd in a mother's arms, again was prest Heart close to heart, and breast to echoing breast,— No whisper gave she of the scene To which her spirit fled; Nor conscious look'd her soul had been Communing with the dead,— Glory and Music might have seen and heard, For which on earth we find no sign, or word. O Thou! Whose sceptre life and death By equal law obey, The grace to consecrate each breath To Thee, our Truth and Way, Be ours to prize; and then, both dooms will be Soothed with the thought, that each is sway'd by Thee. GLORY OF THE MOUNTAINS. “The Lord called to him out of the mountain.”—Exod. xix. 3. “The glory of the Lord stood on the mountain,”—Ezek. xi. 23. How glorious are the mountain-Kings! who overawe the soul, And lift us into fellowship with their sublime control. An era forms it in the hearts which first beneath them bow'd, When haughtily some Alpine-peak out-soar'd the highest cloud. They are not what the dull believe, a mass of speechless earth, But with embodied eloquence proclaim their regal birth; Like anthems mute but magical, to inward thought they praise That Infinite of Architects, Who their foundation lays. Be glory to the mountains! then,—what poetry they make When canopied by lucid air, or mirror'd on the lake; Or when the ravish'd pilgrim cries, from off some wooded brow, “Three hundred cloven summits lift their ice-bound foreheads now!” The throned Archangels who in bliss on seats of glory rest, And through eternity behold the landscapes of the blest, Can scarce, to our imperfect dream, sublimer views enjoy, Than what these Alpine monarchs form,—the mountains of Savoy. The magic of their whiteness seems miraculously pure, And upward their ascending snows our lifted hearts allure; And radiant are the icy spells their soaring masses wield, When seventy leagues cannot o'ershade the dazzling sight they yield. All glory to the ancient hills! which to the godless preach Sermons of more stupendous power, than erring man can reach; Dumb orators to sense they look, but how divinely grand The deep significance they bear, to hearts that understand! The stillness of their frozen trance is more than thunder's tone, Resembling that celestial hush which deepen'd round the Throne When silence through the heaven of heavens for half an hour there reign'd, And seraphim before their God eternity sustain'd! It is not that the clouds array with myriad-tinted hues Those peaks of alabaster ice which pinnacle our views; Nor is it, that our sateless eyes are spell-bound by the scene Of rocky scalps ten thousand feet above some black ravine: Nor is it, that the glaciers lift their crags of gleaming snow And move down in a noiseless march to meet the vale below; Nor all the dreadful joy that chills the soul of him who braves Montánvert! from thy summit vast, the ever-frozen waves: Far more than this do mountain-spells to echoing minds impart When through the veil of outer sense, they reach the central heart,— There enter with mysterious power, like purities to reign, And over all its hidden springs a moral influence gain. Thus oft amid the crowded street, or some contracted room, Or in that hour of mystic sway when all things wear a gloom, The Alpine monarchs lift their peaks, and in remembrance rise, And elevate our sunken hearts through their bewitching skies! They cause our very souls to blush, to think how base and weak Are half the fancied woes we feel, or morbidly would speak; Until their awful summits seem to lift the rallied mind, And bid it soar to peerless heights above depress'd mankind. But what a sacred loftiness do regal mountains claim, When we connect their giant forms with that undying fame Which clings and cleaves to each and all celestial archives bring,— The truths, that martyr'd seers foretell, or sainted harpers sing! Then, glory to the sacred Hills! which rose in childhood's years, And by their ever-awing names inspired our faith and fears,— Moriah's mount, and Amalek, Gilboa and the scene Of Hermon and of Horeb too, where God of old has been. How Gilead and Gerizim's forms, with Lebanon, appeal, And Ebal's, whence the curse roll'd down, to man's religious zeal, And make us through believing awe invest a mountain's brow With magic and with deathless might, beyond what lips avow. And, who but recreant hearts forget, how much sublime event Hath to the hills of Palestine a solemn beauty lent? Behold the peaks of Ararat! for there the Ark did ride And floated o'er a deluged world, which then our God denied. And were not earth's primeval shrines upon lone mountains built? Upon them rose the altars green, where offer'd blood was spilt; There sacrifice from votive hearts, with incense-prayer was given, And who forgets Moriah's hill, and Abram's crown from heaven! And did not in deep thunder-tones the Decalogue descend From Sinai's brow of burning gloom, and with dark conscience blend Such horrors of unearthly sound, that pallid hosts must cry, “Oh, let not God directly speak, or we the death must die!” But neither what dread Moses saw, nor hoary Tishbite heard, Hath ever man's responsive mind with such emotion stirr'd As have those hills and heights divine, where Jesu pray'd and trod, Who by the priesthood of His grace brings pardon'd man to God. 'Twas on some mountain where He met the Demon in that hour When all the gather'd crafts of Hell combined their gloomy power; And thus on hills of loneliness, in lofty hush afar Emmanuel kept His midnight-watch, and pray'd beneath the star. And when His form transfigured grew, with glory more than bright, Which dazzled into dim eclipse the powers of mortal sight, 'Twas Horeb in its soaring grace that witness'd what appear'd, When God Himself unclosed the Heavens, and pale disciples fear'd. But ah! of mountains all which speak to ears of list'ning Time With tones of superhuman truth and eloquence sublime, Dread mountain of The Crucified! in faith we turn to Thee, And echo, with revering hearts, the name of “Calvary!” And next to this eternal Mount, be that where Jesus taught His sermon on Beatitude, with grace and glory fraught,— Those lessons which divinely tell how pure that Heart must be, Which hopes to hymn the Lamb above, and gaze on Deity! So, when the Lord of light arose from out this world of gloom, And re-ascended back to God, His splendour to assume, Thy mountain, Olives! was the spot from whence He upward soar'd, While underneath a cloudy shrine the prostrate band adored. Then, glory to the mountain-Kings! they charm the brave and free, Like monuments to God uprear'd, proclaiming liberty; Religion, Law, and Grace combine, around their form to cast A lofty spell of more than earth, while time and being last. Lord of the Everlasting Hills! Thou life of nature's scene, Whene'er upon some mountain-brow our musing steps have been, Not seldom have such heights become, for mental sacrifice, Like altars which from earth to heaven in lonely grandeur rise: There in the hush of twilight-hour, oh, teach us how to pray, And 'mid their sainted calm of scene adore the Truth and Way; Till what begins in poesy, shall end in deepest prayer, The Mountains into temples turn, and God be hallow'd there. OUR PATTERN IN TEMPTATION. “We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are.”—Heb. iv. 15. Come to the desert where sad Jesu went Lone sinner!—there, as in God's mirror, see Reflected truths, by gracious wisdom meant To balk the arch-Fiend when he tempteth thee. Prophetic actions, typically deep, Forecasting all the future Church should feel When blasting trials round her bulwarks sweep, And fiend and foe combine against her weal Were those dark trials, when by grace upheld The fasting Saviour with a Demon fought, And by His word the powers of darkness fell'd And back to perfect heaven our Nature brought. Unknown, the virtue which is never tried; And principle by keen temptation proves How much for God and glory is denied The earth-born will our ruin'd manhood loves. The triple force of this perverted world Aims at our heart a threefold blow of sin: And souls that would not from their faith be hurl'd, By providence without and prayer within Defence must find;—from these apart, they fail The world, the devil, and the flesh to fight; Darkness and doubt will o'er their creed prevail And, Cain-like, plunge them in disastrous night. How did Emmanuel each infernal dart Repulse, unwounded, from His perfect soul?— By words divine! those bucklers of the heart, Temper'd by Heaven against the Fiend's control. Alas! for souls, if in their perill'd hour When sin and self, those Satans of the mind, Besiege our graces with commingled power, Staid reason prove the only shield we find. Nor let the righteous who to Love belong, Dream that temptation will not dog their path; When saints are weak, alone they seem the strong, And self-mistrust a true foundation hath. E'en in pure ecstasies of prayer and praise When nearest round the Throne of bliss they move, Visions from hell may float before their gaze, And hide the glories of the heaven they love. Here is our wisdom,—with a wakeful mind The sense to watch, and pray down each desire Which tempts the conscience to be base, or blind, By fanning embers of unhallow'd fire. And oh, what deeps of consolation ope, Like heavens of comfort, in this creed divine,— That not alone with Darkness thou wilt cope, For in temptation Christ believed is thine. He left His Throne, The stricken Man to be, Tempted and tried, by anguish spent and worn, And drew from earth that boundless sympathy By which He lives, to succour the forlorn. Then cheer thee! O thou troubled, toss'd, and tried; Orphan'd in spirit, dream not of despair, Open yon heavens, and lo! The Crucified Echoes thy heart in beating concord, there. Thy Lord beseech, by all on earth He knew, Facing the Demon in his dreadest hours; Whose soul remains as tender and as true As when it wept o'er Judah's fated towers. A mother may her new-born child forget, And exiled hearts their fatherland forego, But Christ in heaven eternalizes yet Each tone of Manhood He obtain'd below. E'en there, behold our sympathising Priest In feeling human as in form divine; And seraphs listen, when of saints the least May boldly cry,—“Incarnate Love is mine!” REASON AND DEATH. “The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart ? none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.”—Isa. lvii. 1. The noblest wealth our world contains Is holiness of heart; All other gold it gets, or gains, But proves the meanest part. Most regal is that glorious will Enslaved to God alone, Which finds it freedom to fulfil Each mandate of His throne: Blest Angels by a law like this Partake their perfect heaven, And could not feel consummate bliss If other law were given. Obedience is adoring joy, Rebellion brings despair, And would the heaven of heavens destroy If Self-will triumph'd there! Yet holiness may not avoid The doom corruption brought; Since Adam fell, by sin destroy'd, Hath death his carnage wrought. The sting, but not the stroke, of death The Lord from man removed; And they who draw the briefest breath Are oft the most beloved,— Beloved by God, and angels too, And thus from grief and pain Rapt far above our sense-bound view, With Christ in heaven to reign. But oh! how cold the world becomes As saint on saint departs, To brighten in elysian homes With pure and perfect hearts. As if from out yon starry choir Which chant around the sun, Some choral planet quench'd his fire Which we were gazing on, Impov'rish'd seems our orphan'd earth When good men pass away; Time cannot spare their solemn worth, But needs it, day by day. But still, for them we dare not grieve The christian path who trod, If early call'd this life to leave For glory, and for God. To them the gain, to us the loss High providence assigns; And so appoints a deeper cross Than mortal thought divines. Genius, and worth, and wisdom, all From God alone arise; And when He wills the same recall, They seek their natal skies. Then hush thee, murm'ring Heart! and let Profound bereavements teach Lessons more pure than pale regret By discontent can reach. The righteous die, but still they live A life of soul in bliss; And what Eternity can give, Outweighs a world like this! Men would not marvel, could they see The lustres round The Throne, Why saints and martyrs yearn'd to be Where all the Just have flown. Sorrow, and sin, and change no more In heaven their love alloy; The fever of harsh time is o'er, And Christ their perfect joy. We talk and think, as if our world Were all Jehovah made, And when from some false mountain hurl'd, Tremble, as tho' betray'd: Yet, earth is but a point in space, Our being, scarce a breath; And he who will not life disgrace Must die before his death. The booming knell, the opening grave, The vacant room and chair Should summon us to hopes which save The mind from meaner care. Hereafter is the home of soul, The paradise of thought, And with its unsubdued control, Lord! be our bosom fraught. As friend on friend, revered and wise, Leave wither'd hearts alone, Lift our low dreams beyond the skies Around Thine argent throne! Weaker and weaker grows the spell Which binds the soul below, When more than burning numbers tell By grace begins to glow Deep in those hearts, which death has fill'd With placid grief profound; Where every pang is lull'd and still'd By Him who gave the wound. Thus with the dead the living hold Communion grave and high; Their bodies are but pulseless mould, But spirits claim the sky. Thy church, O Christ! is unconfined By what men hear, or see, Since all who own a saintly mind Are in eternity By hope and faith,—from whence they draw Breathings of praise and prayer; While He, Whom martyr'd Stephen saw, Becomes their Magnet, there. THE POETRY OF SPRING. “Lo the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come.”—Cant. ii. 11, 12. “Bless the Lord, O my soul ? He sendeth the springs into the valleys—watereth the hills from his chambers—causeth the grass to grow—appointeth the moon for seasons ? O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.”—Ps. civ. passim. Hark! breezy anthems from the new-born spring, Like hymning air-birds on exultant wing; Wide o'er the fields a flushing radiance glows, And vernal gladness through each woodland flows. A seeming consciousness inspires the earth As though the soil were blooming into mirth, And, like rich blood in some glad creature's veins, New tides of life are mantling through her plains. Music and motion haunt each choral bough, Like living spirits fill'd with joyance now; Here, lyric tones, there, wave-like murmurs rise, And there, the cadence of contented sighs. Swift o'er the pebbles haste the hill-born streams, And lisp and laugh, like infants in their dreams; Or else, make liquid music as they run, In fairy stanzas warbled to the sun. The stainless magic of each new-born flower Mirrors the charm of Heaven's creative power; Beauty comes forth, like melody from lyres Swept by some hand which Poesy inspires. Look where you may, expressive gleams of youth Dart through the conscience this celestial truth,— That Christ is working resurrection-life, Till earth grows radiant and with fulness rife. The silken azure of yon ruffled sea, The wing'd emotions of each bird, and bee, Blent with a chorus of yon festal streams,— All sway the sense, and beautify our dreams. And when Morn reddens, until soft and soon, The golden brightness of unbreathing noon O'erveils the landscape with a slumb'rous light, Still shall creation yield intense delight. Let but the heart be spiritually clear, Let but our soul this God-made earth revere, Then will poetic eyes religion greet, From stars on high, to insects at our feet. For what is Nature, but a Book divine Where Godhead dictates each material line, Where each pure object proves almighty Thought Forth from its viewless depths to vision brought? Alas! for Souls, if men baptized can find Nothing in nature to accost the mind, Since all around them, did they read it well, Bears the high meaning of some holy spell. Sense cannot see them, but bright Angels may Direct the sunbeams which adorn the Day, Entone the breeze, and oft at vesper-hour, Close the bent eyelid of each baby flower. Cold Science worships philosophic Cause, And for its God reveres vicarious laws, Orphans creation of Jehovah's care, And longs to silence what her scenes declare; But Thou! by Whom all seasons reign and rule, Fount of the fresh, the fair, and beautiful! For ever may Thine angel-spring impart This glorious symbol to each saintly heart,— As wintry Earth Her floral garb assumes, So will the dead, when summon'd from their tombs, Rise at Thy voice, in resurrection-dress, And beam with everlasting loveliness. Beatitudes. POOR IN SPIRIT. FIRST BEATITUDE. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”—Matt. v. 3. With awful gloom when Moses brought The law of fire and flame, Eternal Duty then was taught In dread Jehovah's name. But radiantly descendeth now Deep wisdom from above; For mildness clothes His gracious brow Whose ev'ry line is love. It was not thus the Type of old Imperial Law declared, When round Him pealing thunders roll'd And red-wing'd lightnings glared. The people shudder'd, like a leaf, Amid their black'ning gloom; And Conscience saw no just relief Beyond, or in, the tomb. But bright the contrast now appears, When the mild Lord of grace From you green Mount dispels all fears, By His benignant face. The breeze, soft lyrist of the spring, Was harping o'er the flowers; And humming bees upon the wing Enjoy'd their golden hours; A vernal radiance threw its gleam Of gladness o'er the hills; While, rich as love-tones in a dream, The gushing of the rills. And like the season, so the Word Was mild as mercy's breath; No curse was in His counsel heard, Nor doom of legal death. That Christ, who came the lost to save, With blessing did begin; And thus from guilt, and death, and grave Redeem'd the heart within. Humility and meekness were The groundwork Jesu laid; And He, whose life was living prayer, Their perfect types display'd. All mental grace, all moral gift, Whate'er men seek, or find, Is blasted,—if it proudly lift Or bloat the conscious mind. Contingent, finite, from the dust, What Nothings are we all! For in the tomb the proudest must A worm his brother call. All pride becomes a fiendish spark Of hell, within the soul; And He who dreads that region dark, Abhors its least control. The poor in spirit, blest are they Above the world who live; Their wisdom is to watch and pray, And, like their Lord, forgive. Nor seek they for ambition's wealth, Or sigh for world-applause; But, calm in sickness as in health, To Heaven commit their cause. True meekness is that master-grace Which saints and martyrs wore;— Behold, who led proud Judah's race, How mild a mien He bore! We cannot back to God return From the base depths of sin, Until bencath the Cross we learn To form the Christ within. And was He not, of worlds the Lord, In meckness all divine, Who with each high and heavenly word A lowly grace did twine? A passion for imperfect good,— Behold, what fosters pride; While God Himself is thus withstood No idols are denied. But mortal, wouldst thou blessèd be? From finite good retire; And in the depths of Deity Thy soaring thoughts inspire. In humbleness of mind believe A true contentment reigns,— Desires which no compunction leave, And joys that bring no pains. Then turn thee, O earth-fever'd Soul! From broken cisterns fly; For couldst thou drink their blissful whole They still would leave thee dry. The utmost in all creatures fails An inward lull to bring, Since, when our purest dream prevails, Unrest keeps murmuring. Low as some weanèd child to lie Before Emmanuel's feet, And in the guidance of His eye To find a safe retreat, Like Him to crucify the will, As mereiful and meek, And each just orb of duty fill Whene'er we act, or speak,— Be this, disciple of the Cross! The glory of thine aim; And though on earth thou reap the loss, In heaven perceive thy gain. But, saith He not, that here below Beatitudes begin, For all whose hearts by meekness grow Above the self of sin? A kingdom of the mind is theirs While yet on earth they bide; And heaven seems dawning through the prayers God's Spirit hath supplied. Celestial Dove of grace! descend, Thy gentleness impart; Till Faith shall build the “Sinner's friend” A temple in her heart. THEY THAT MOURN. SECOND BEATITUDE. “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”—Matt. v. 4. Oh, paradox divine, as deep!— The blest are those who wail and weep, And bear that burden which no hearts allay: With rose-buds though the World be crown'd While rubied wine-cups circle round, In fev'rish gloom her false dreams melt away. The Man of Sorrows, in Whose tear The Church can type her own career, The God-man, whose profound extremes combined Whate'er of glory and of gloom His awful Person could assume,— On Mourners stamp'd the name of blest mankind. But not o'er all sad minds, which mourn Like orphans in a world forlorn, Have lips Almighty thus pronounced the “bless'd;” For grief is oft a selfish chord, Whose earth-tones can no proof afford That God and grace have e'er the will imprest. The mourners who “about the streets” Of thronging life a stranger meets, Full often are they but proud Sin in tears; 'Tis worldly sorrow working death Which now intones their anguish'd breath, And fetters them with darkness, and with fears. Spent Minds, like these, none dare believe Are purely blest, because they grieve, Or pine that earth no more their heaven supplies; But blest are they who mourn within The rankling wound of venom'd sin, Waking, beyond all woe, their soul-heaved sighs. For, sin is that stupendous grief Which out of God finds no relief,— A tainting curse which cleaves to flesh and soul; And so abhorr'd around The Throne, The very heavens appear to groan And bow dejected at its dread control! 'Tis true, bland Nature's tear-drops flow To mark cold earth a churchyard grow, While tombs rise countless as the waves at sea; Sickness and sorrow, change and care, And pale-worn features ev'ry where Reveal the hollowness vain life must be. But Zion's mourners grieve and pine, To think that law and love divine O'er caitiff man can wield such transient sway,— How all the Trinity of grace One bosom-sin will oft displace, And give to passion's dream its boundless play! Such weepers mourn before The Lamb, And cry, “Oh! wretched that I am! Who shall deliver me, and burst my chain?” Their hearts are crush'd, and inly rent To find what base alloy is blent With that “fine gold” where virtue feels no stain. For this they blush, and burden'd lie, In self-abhorrence shrink, and sigh; And when they muse on Jesu's awful groans, And how the garden soil was wet And crimson'd with His bloody sweat,— Their hearts beat prayer, which Godhead hears alone! 'Tis here a grief sublime appears: And rays of glory light the tears Of Souls, which mourn for heaven's almighty wrong: Oh! then descends the Paraclete And calms them with mild comfort meet, And turns their sadness to victorious song. Dejected Minds, who thus are blest By sealing grace, are more impress'd, And bland and meek as charity become: Reflective awe and deep'ning prayer The growing work of God declare, And bid them pant for heaven's unclouded Home. So, when these days of darkness cease, And holy death shall bring release From sorrow's gloom, and sin's intense alloy, How will they glory in that God Who said, while earth's bleak wilds they trod, That they who sow in tears, shall reap in joy! MEEKNESS. THIRD BEATITUDE. “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”—Matt. v. 5. Thy ways, O Lord, are unlike ours, Thy Thoughts surpass our own; And angels, when they scan their powers, Fall wing-veil'd round the Throne. Eternity Thine eyes peruse, Omniscient is Thy mind; And whatsoe'er Thy wisdom choose Is perfect in its kind. But we, by pride and passion stain'd, Our good no longer know, And when we dream the goal is gain'd, Have reach'd intenser woe. Ay, Good and Evil, Pain and Bliss In vain blind heathens thought To image in a world like this Those models which they sought. Our Centre true they could not see In aught the creatures bring; But Christ, who show'd us Deity, Unveils that holy Thing. But yet a paradox this wears To men who walk by sense, Which deep humility declares The heart's sublime defence. Resistance seems a noble gift To reason's haughty view; And passions that proud self uplift Re-echo it as true. But He whose will was crucified Throughout His sad career; Whom earth abhorr'd, and man denied One sympathetic tear, By bearing outrage, wrong, and hate, This heaven-born lesson taught,— That souls are not divinely great Except with meekness fraught. Submission tender, mild, and deep, Not sullen, stern, or sad, But gentle as when Angels weep While they o'erwatch the bad, Such the chaste virtue Christ commends, Believer! as divine; And if thy heart its Master bends, That lovely grace is thine. And who with such a just appeal To injured souls could cry, “Like Me must true disciples feel If doom'd to live or die?” In Christ the Lamb and Lion met, Their graces were combined; And blest are those who follow yet The path He left behind. Whether before the Council placed, Or girt with savage yell, Or else, by fiendish mock disgraced Whose accent came from hell; Or, nail'd upon the wrenching Cross In one incarnate pang, While foes beneath Him rage and toss, And impious gibings rang,— However tried, 'tis patience all! From Him no wrath-tones roll; To God ascends each dying call Which rent His yielded soul. And who can keep a Christlike heart, Except his moral tone, When call'd to bear life's bitter part, Recall the Saviour's own? Yet deem not that in stoic frost Warm feelings must be chill'd; Or that impassion'd minds are lost When thus by patience still'd. Perturb'd emotions, strong and keen, When pure Religion's cause Demands a Hero for her scene, Infringe no hallow'd laws: But, guard thee well! lest temper stain And poison glorious zeal, Till selfish anger's secret reign Proves all the god we feel. Meek charity, that master-grace The peerless type of heaven, Oh, let it from thy creed displace What cannot say, “forgiven!” Nor ever let the sun go down Upon our inward ire; They cannot wear a Saviour's crown Whom love doth not inspire. Pure Lord of lowliness, and love! Thus make Thy model dear To all who live for thrones above, By bearing crosses here. Thy meekness hath its own reward, Calm blessings line its path; Without, it keeps celestial guard, Within, true peace it hath! The proud are poor, 'mid all the gold Ambition's pride obtains; The meek are rich, though none behold The beauty of their gains. No acres may to them belong, No scenes of garish pleasure; But yet they chant a mental song O'er Truth's divinest treasure. Then, Lord of Gentleness! be Thou For ever at our side; And when we mark Thy wounded brow, Abhorr'd be human pride! We are not Thine, unless we bear Thy yoke upon our souls, And welcome in each cross and care The Hand which All controls. Disciples true the Christ reflect, And must His shadows be; And none but craven souls reject The watchword,—“Follow Me!” Yes, “follow Thee;” Lord, grant the will, And Love at once agrees Their heaven to taste, whose hearts fulfil What Thy calm word decrees. In life and death such spirits burn To hear Thy Voice divine, And glorify each grace they learn By using it as Thine. RIGHTEOUSNESS. FOURTH BEATITUDE. “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.”—Matt. v. 6. The hand of Him who framed the earth Hath fill'd it with harmonious grace, That men, who boast immortal birth, In each created thing may trace How wondrously celestial Art, From all without which meets the eye, Appeals to our most inward heart, And proves two worlds in harmony. The world we see, and what we are, Illustrates that accordance due Which reigns from insect up to star, And hallows all we feel, or do,— If thus our hearts delight to prove How faculties their objects find, And render Life a hymn of love To Him who hath both worlds combined. But still there is a craving force In appetites to sense allied, Which nature in its noblest course Hath never to the brim supplied; Though charm'd and fed, they are not fill'd, But fever'd oft with discontent; The cry for “more!” no joy hath still'd,— Unrest is with fruition blent. Though sumless orbs of beauty roll In burning magic through the sky, When mortal gaze commands the whole, For brighter longs the asking eye! And when we hear the tones which make The sweetest heaven that sound can bring, Melodious thirst they do not slake For some diviner murmuring. But while both eye and ear demand What no imperfect Sense enjoys, Spirits who under grace expand A bliss partake which never cloys,— The bliss of hung'ring more and more That “righteousness” may still dispense To sainted hearts an added store Of purer calm, and innocence: Behold! a hunger, and a thirst Which God Himself will soothe and slake,— Ambition by no fever cursed, A hope no blighting sorrows break; For all those wingèd dreams that rise And flutter round a World divine, When heaven unveils its hidden prize, Will find far more than dreams combine. Perennial glories there surpass All which seraphic Minds desire, Whom angels with themselves may class, With fervid hearts for God on fire; Of finite good who only drinks, Such water will be found in vain; A deeper want than passion thinks, Will soon enkindle thirst again. The man who lives by sensual dross, May banquet on some hollow bliss, But yet this truth his mind will cross,— I was not made for food like this! Hunger and thirst, they make the all Which carnal wisdom can create, Whate'er encrowning words may call The glories which enwreathe the great. From joy to joy the jaded Sense Pursues each worn and wearied path; Though big may be this world's pretence, The mind eternal hunger hath; Within, what flaming thirst there burns Which all polluting draughts excite, As passion and supply by turns Fever the day, and fret the night! But Grace forms those, to whom is given A glorious passion fix'd on God, Who breathe on earth the air of heaven, And tread the ground Emmanuel trod; Their creed and conduct are combined In unity of peace and power, And mirror forth a saintly mind When darkness clouds the drearest hour. They must be tranquil, who are made By God, the guardian of the blest, Of neither Hell nor Earth afraid, While panting for elysian rest: Their hunger is a holy thing, Their bosom-thirst a painful bliss; And lauding Seraphs shake their wing Of rapture o'er unrest like this! What is it?—but to nobly pine More Christlike in true love to be, Or body forth the will divine, And heaven in all things ever see: Till rectitude a nature grow, And holiness the spirit's breath, And faith alike in weal or woe Adorn our life, and vanquish death. But if indeed the hunger'd mind And thirsting heart for Jesu long, Then will they not meet nurture find To nurse and make religion strong? Incarnate God! such mystic food Thine own ordaining words supplied, Which in Thy Body and Thy Blood A Banquet for the soul provide. Thy sacred Flesh, oh! let us eat, And drink the awful Wine-blood there, Where faith Thy bleeding Form can greet 'Mid swells of sacrificial prayer: The blasting spells of unbelief Must sure those famish'd Hearts infect, Who feel no pang of boundless grief When they such angel-food neglect. Soul of our souls! almighty Grace, A sacramental life impart, And by some inward power erase Whatever dulls the deaden'd heart: For holiness a hunger give, And yearnings of intenser love That we on Christ may learn to live, Like daily Manna from above. In heaven we need no sacrament; Nor signs nor symbols there are found, When glory with its full content Shall each elected Saint have crown'd; Adorn'd in robes of radiant white They neither thirst, nor hunger more, But bask in beams of pure delight With all their toils and trials o'er. Around the Throne in rich array Perfect and sinless are they now, And in God's temple night and day Before the shrine of Glory bow; The Lamb Himself their food supplies, And on His fulness they can feed, Who follow Him with tearless eyes Where paths to living fountains lead. BE MERCIFUL. FIFTH BEATITUDE. “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.”—Matt. v. 7. When God to man His awful Image gave In pure creation's primal bliss, The Wisdom, Who hereafter came to save A sinful world so vile as this, The brightest feature of the Godhead drew By deep impression on his soul, And bade compassion most divinely true Reign o'er his breast with unsubdued control. Our mix'd emotions may be good, or vile, They govern by ambiguous laws; But mercy is of nobler cast and style, And rooted in no selfish cause;— How godlike, let Emmanuel's life declare! Whose heart with such compassion beat, That His pure soul to each sad tone and prayer On earth became an echoing mercy-seat. Let stoic Schools from other creeds erect An iron system, cold and dead, That would from God-created souls reject Emotions out of pity bred; Men are half-monsters, if no heart be left To throb with pathos, and to feel Like Jesus, when He saw a home bereft, And down His cheek compassion's tear did steal. Thus mercy forms the Saviour's darling grace, And in Him took a shape divine; In word and deed, behold its beaming trace Throughout th' Incarnate Myst'ry shine! His heart replied to each pale Woe that wept, Or echo'd back man's deeper sigh; And by the grave, no icy grandeur kept The tear of Manhood from His sacred eye. The haughty coldness of inhuman creeds May scorn Compassion shedding tears, And blandly pouring over Sorrow's needs Those genial tones which soften fears; And Science may to selfishness ascribe What soft-eyed Pity for the wretched feels; But, heaven-born Virtue bears the heathen gibe, Nor checks the tear which from compassion steals. Of Men the wisest, bravest, and the best, The lofty-hearted, firm, and free, On whose proud name an empire's glories rest, Who guide the land and guard our sea,— No leaden calm of unimpassion'd mind Their boast has been, or proved them brave; But all pure links, connecting kind with kind, They deem'd them holy, as beyond the grave! Men are not wise because they cannot weep, Nor basely soft because they sigh; For there are fountains in the heart that sleep Which moisten oft the sternest eye; The sainted heroes, canonised by time, And martyr'd hosts, who burn'd or bled,— The wide earth doth not deem them less sublime Because they soothed the sad, or mourn'd the dead! The perfect God, though passionless as pure, Hath symbolised His awful Name By deep emotions, which the heart allure, And bend the will before His claim: He speaks not only in the whirlwind's tone, But with the calm of cooling eve: And oft holds back the thunders of His Throne, That dreadless Minds may love Him, and believe. But Thou, blest Archetype of love divine! In whom the Trinity express Whate'er by union God and man combine Of moral grace, and loveliness, Thy Soul was tender as thy Flesh was true, And throbb'd with thrills of deepest power; Unmoved in Godhead, yet a living hue Of warm emotion tinged Thy farewell-hour. And art Thou now, embodied Lord of love! In such deep calm of bliss enthroned That to the Priesthood of Thy grace above, Though deep the sigh by anguish groan'd,— It cannot ripple into feeling there Thy heart of tenderness, and truth? Oh, is it echoless to high-breathed prayer, Utter'd by sin and woe, from age, or youth? That creed reject! 'tis infidel and wrong; The Church adores a Priest in heaven To Whom compassions most intense belong, By which He feels for man forgiven; And He is touch'd with sympathies that thrill Through the rich glories round His Throne; Since all those splendours leave Messiah still The weeper's refuge, and the widow's own. Fountain of mercy! whose melodious word Peals in the soul like pity's voice, Be each chaste heart by such compassion stirr'd As makes Thy love its peerless choice; For if with mercy for their fallen clay Men are not melted, nor commoved, How will they shrink from that awarding Day When barren creeds by Christ are unapproved! Souls cannot love, unless like Him they feel For human sorrows, hopes, and fears; And learn to soften with benignant zeal The bitter gush of orphan tears: For God is Love; compassions wreathe His name; And children of pure Grace are we When, like His echoes, we become the same, And Love on earth reflects her Deity. PURE IN HEART. SIXTH BEATITUDE. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”—Matt. v. 8. How blessèd are the pure in heart! And none are blest beside; For nought of heaven can grace impart If pureness be denied. Can sightless eyeballs see the Sun, Though Earth lie bathed in beams, And o'er each hill he shines upon A ray of rapture gleams? No more can tainted spirits gaze On glories round the Throne: Mere darkness would become That blaze Pure hearts can bear alone. The Moon cannot her image glass On restless waves which rise, For when the storm-winds o'er them pass, Her broken semblance dies; And so, where passion's lurid fires The love of truth erase, No sight of God the soul inspires, But all grows blind and base. By heavenly likeness Hearts discern The secrets most divine; Just as we live, so much we learn Of Thee, O God! and Thine. Those inward eyes of purity By which the mind beholds Ideal truths Sin cannot see, That God Himself unfolds,— Unless we have them, vain is all The science stored within; Our creed the world may holy call, But such proud wealth is sin. And here, behold that peerless Law Proving the Gospel's worth, Beyond what sage or poet saw, When most he soar'd from earth: That law is purity intense, A chastity divine, A sacred glow of innocence, Which keeps the heart a shrine,— A shrine of holiness and power Whence praise and prayer ascend, To seek what soothes the sternest hour Which can the Christian bend. Then, weigh thy heart! disciple, keep That ceaseless pulse of life; Which even through innocuous sleep Can throb with sin, and strife. Mysterious, ever-active spring Of central thought, and will! To which time, sense, and motion bring Perpetual good, or ill. By thee we live, and love, and hate, The inward Man art thou; Thy nature dooms our final state, And that is forming now! Oh! watch we then, with jealous eyes, That world where God alone Searches the secret thoughts which rise Like shades before His Throne. As local space the body holds, So God the mind contains; And who can dare what He enfolds To mar with sinful stains? He dwells in us, and we in Him, The Temple of all souls! And pure as prostrate seraphim Be all which He controls. For if the ground by Moses trod With sanctity was fill'd, When erst the flaming bush of God An o'erawed patriarch still'd, Sublimer far than thought can trace Is He, the all-divine, Who is in Christ our dwelling-place And Soul-embracing Shrine. Eternal Spring of purity! Descend, propitious Dove; From heart-corruption make us free, By turning law to love. The blessèd are the pure, indeed, And wretched, the defiled; In whose dark bosom dwell and breed Lone passions, fierce and wild. By likeness only, souls can see The glories Heaven contains; But minds which nurse impurity Would feel them worse than pains. For purity is heaven below, And sin the hell of man, And all eternity will show, Will be,—what time began. PEACEMAKERS. SEVENTH BEATITUDE. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.”—Matt. v. 9. When first rebellion in the Will began And faith in God to faith in Self was changed, Wild discord woke within the soul of man, And headlong impulse o'er his being ranged. For peace expires where purity is lost, And purity by love to God begins; Who calls him “Father!”—let him count the cost And pluck the right eye from his bosom-sins. And who, with such a God-beseeming grace, Could weave heaven's garland round the tranquil mind, As Christ, who purchased for our forfeit-race The peace divine which lulls heart-torn mankind? Lord of our lineage, and of saving calm, When first from veil'd eternity He came, A natal anthem o'er night's dewy balm Sang the rich notes of His melodious name; And they breath'd, “Peace on earth! to man Goodwill!” And, ere He soar'd to His primeval splendour, “Peace” was the word that hung soft music still Round farewell doctrine, so benignly tender. The first of blessings, like the last, is found Thus by our Lord, as deepest and divine; And ne'er may calm and confidence abound Till faith and feeling round this truth combine. Where low'ring envy, wrath, or secret pride, Ambition, avarice, and revenge are nursed, Here can no halcyon from the heavens abide, But all is chaos, with convulsion cursed. Base passions are the serpents of our soul, Which bite, and sting to bitterness the heart, And where they wield their unsubdued control, Angels and grace from that foul den depart. But when these hearts atoning Blood makes white, Soft o'er our spirit broods the mystic Dove; Like the hush'd band who watch'd their sheep by night, A “peace on earth,” replies to peace above. Then like our Lord, magnanimous and meek, Move where we may, our end is still the same; Firm to our vow, in all we do or speak We dare embody our baptismal name. No longer as the Lord of Hosts, and War, Doth God the glories of His will unfold; But radiant as the lull of evening star As Lord of Peace His pard'ning smile behold. And saints on earth resemble Him in heaven, Who help to circulate the calm of love, And by imparting what to each is given Prove their high lineage from the Lord above. Makers of Peace! your task divine complete, Two sever'd hearts in unity restore; And bid mild harmonies of friendship meet To rule in homes where they have reign'd before. For ah! how mournful, when two friends depart Wider and wider into distance stern, While each one holds the arrow at his heart, And, but for pride, would lovingly return. And more than beauteous is a god-like word Breathing soft balm o'er that tempestuous hour, When some vile Satan of the soul hath stirr'd, Or maddens nature with demoniac power. To stand between like mediating Grace And make two alienated minds agree, Sublimes our being, and reveals the trace Of true adoption into Deity. And, blest are they who private love promote In bow'rs domestic, where meek Virtue dwells; While feelings motherly their aim devote To people home with tranquillizing spells. And not unblest are those, who nobly guard The lofty sacredness of public Weal; Theirs the rich peace that brings its own reward, When Empires at the throne of Godhead kneel. And He, in whom all unities reside, Celestial Fount from whence communions flow, Husband of Souls, who took His chosen Bride And call'd it by the name of Church, below,— How can we love Him, if we dare to rend By the rude harshness of sectarian will That Mystic Body, where all members blend And by their harmony due office fill? How can we love Him, if our “Church” we choose As pride, or reason, and presumption sway?— Defend us, Grace! from Babylonian views, And teach us, not to argue, but obey. Be ours submission, Mary-like and meek, Who love the path anointed martyrs trod; Learning to crucify what most we seek When Self would image a sectarian God. So shall we have that sabbath peace of mind, A wealth beyond the golden worlds to buy,— A boundless heart which beats for all mankind, As though it throbb'd beneath the Saviour's eye. True source of harmony, and sacred peace, Spirit Divine! without Thee all is vain; Descend, and with Thy lulling power release The souls which suffer from a selfish chain. A loving will that leaps at duty's call Do Thou bestow, whate'er the trial be, Bearing the cross which heaven provides for all Whose faith, O Lord, exults to follow Thee. Unfathom'd peace! my Saviour's final prayer, Deep in pure Godhead doth thy basis lie; Reign like a boundless glory everywhere, And guard us while we live, and when we die. THE REVILED. EIGHTH BEATITUDE. “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake ? when men shall revile you ? and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake: great is your reward in heaven.”—Matt. v. 10—12. “My years are in the yellow leaf, Though few their number found,”— But, God is greater than thy grief And knows the deepest wound; Be this thy balm, in some distemper'd mood When sad Thoughts sing their dirge in mental solitude. This world becomes a barren scene To eyes of sunny Youth, When vices have victorious been, And falsehood vanquish'd truth, Where good men weep, and Virtue droops in shade, And minds of most heroic mould are blighted and betray'd. Thus to pale martyrs of the Cross, Distracted earth appears An orphan'd realm, where pain and loss Demand perpetual tears; And were it all that God for man decreed, Who would not in despair for widow'd Nature bleed? But soon will dawn a radiant clime Where sin nor sorrows reign, Beyond the clouds of changing time To shadow, or to stain; A bright eternity of balm and bliss Where pangless hearts forget a life so false as this. And let the full-toned anthem rise In swells of grateful joy, That Faith beholds with prescient eyes What time nor tears destroy,— A perfect life, compensative of all Impetuous thoughts presume unworthy heaven to call. It was not thus ere christian light Arose on heathen gloom, For then the soul immersed in night Found life a living tomb; Confusion reign'd o'er providence denied, And when of death it thought, the craven bosom sigh'd. But now, a beam celestial plays From out the Page divine; And round the gloom of grief-worn days What dawning glories shine! O'er ruin'd hopes descending to the grave The banners of the Cross, sublimely do they wave. And thus what Sense injustice deems, That saints can suffer wrong,— No more a fearful problem seems To souls by faith made strong; For o'er them, hark! the “blessed” mildly breathed From Him who round His head the crown of anguish wreathed. Yea, “blessed” are the souls which bear For Christ, and His pure laws, The moral pang and mental wear Which friend, or foe can cause; Since all we suffer, if the will be sound, Hereafter in the Heavens shall to our bliss redound. And thus when God incarnate taught Upon the Mount enthroned, That they should be to glory brought Whom scorning earth disown'd, And so enjoy, by His great mercy given, A crown which shall outshine what seraphs wear in heaven, A vision then before Him rose Of all His Church would be, As doom'd to battle with her woes, Till death and darkness flee; And not one heart that since has broke, or sigh'd, A soothing balm for which He did not then provide. Hosannah! cry celestial Hearts Whom persecution brands, And bear unmoved infernal darts When hurl'd by godless hands; 'Tis thus the Soldiers of the truth are train'd,— Those Heroes of the Lord, who heaven's own laurels gain'd. By love, and patient suffering led, More Christlike men become; And meekly while the path we tread Which leads our spirit home, Our graces brighten while they vanquish woe, And saintly virtue springs from soils where trials grow. And, do we not corruption feel Our purest dreams assail, While wounds which grace alone can heal Make harrow'd conscience pale? But these are cleansed by consecrated fire, As persecuted saints more soaringly aspire. When clothed with age, or clad with youth, Whate'er life's era be, Men glorify the force of truth Who God in anguish see; And prove what strength His promises impart Who, high upon His Throne, can hear the fainting heart. In all things should the Church reflect Her regal Lord divine; And ne'er with sin, or change, or sect, Her vestal charms combine: To suffer, is the privilege of love, In which the saints outsoar what angels do above. Then wonder not, if sighs or tears, Or contumelious shame, Inweave the web of perill'd years, Nor God's deep wisdom blame; But rather, in earth's malediction see A shadow of the Cross endured, O Lord, by Thee. Those peerless graces hearts require To fit the Saints for heaven, Are burnish'd by that sacred fire To martyr'd anguish given; Love, faith, and valour, are the three which make The stature of the Soul her full perfection take. And, thus conform'd to Thee and Thine, Seraphic Minds ascend, Till with Thine image, Lord, they shine And with Thy glories blend; So proud a bliss heroic saints procure Who with undaunted hearts their giant pangs endure. SILENCE OF THE SOUL. “Joseph could not refrain himself ? Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.”—Gen. xlv. 1. The depths of ocean rest unseen However loud the storm-blasts ride, Though where some whirlwind's rage hath been Foam whitens o'er the flashing tide: For underneath in waveless trance The spirit of stern Water sleeps, And thunderbolt and lightning-glance Disturb not its unechoing deeps. But not like this, majestic Souls The tempest of the heart betray, Whom wisdom chastens, or controls By principles of regal sway: Unlike the sea, their surface lies Becalm'd without; all pale and proud, Where not a ripple meets the eyes Of those who make the vulgar crowd. And thus the heaven-born Spartan bears With mien and manner undisturb'd Whatever doom his God declares:— He by divine restraint hath curb'd Those passion-bursts, which wildly break From mere excitement's maddening hour, When stormy pangs the bosom shake And palsy Reason's noble power. Who that has heard the gush of woe From some wild mourner by the grave, And mark'd the scalding tear-drop's flow A sunken cheek of sorrow lave, Or thrill'd beneath those harrowing sighs Which burst from out a breaking heart, And felt not, with o'erflooding eyes, What giant pangs death-scenes impart? But grief there is far more sublime, Enacted in this world of gloom, Which haunts us through memorial time With shadow deeper than the tomb;— 'Tis when we hear an earth-clod fall Upon the coffin's lid of death With clay-cold accents, which appal And half suspend our choking breath, With stealthy eye we dare to scan The face of some bereaved one there.— And lo! he seems a tearless man, Whose pang no outward signs declare? No shudders through his bosom heave, His features with no anguish move; And worldlings guess he does not grieve, And think him all too stern to love! But, look again! and thou wilt see That iron Soul which sheds no tear, A mass of buried agony Though none to outward sense appear: His very calm is woe congeal'd, A pulseless depth of chill despair; And what no stormful pang reveal'd, Felt like a frozen tempest there. Hush'd are high feelings, when their course Springs from the soul's pure fountain-head; Though language cannot speak their force, Yet, far beyond what lips have said, Down the deep spirit's veil'd recess They nurse their harrow'd nature true; And those mankind for stoics guess Bear hidden wounds, which none can view! The storm-voice of some open grief Too often proves a shallow heart; And there are pangs from earth's relief Which proud and pure stand all apart; Like the stern patriarch's, when he felt Fond yearnings of the brother rise,— The voiceless heart they inly melt, And shun the gaze of common eyes. So dwells there in each virgin mind Some bashful Grace, that will not bare Its beauty unto coarse mankind, But comes to God in secret prayer: The tumult of religious talk, Impassion'd tones of Self unveil'd, With all which crowds life's vulgar walk,— Heaven has not for her children hail'd. Thus Nature hides her “secret things;” Her wonder-works,—what eye can see The plan whereby Perfection brings Their essence out of Deity? All matter, motion, growth, and life Are myst'ries here, which man defy, And work with deeper wisdom rife, Than Science reads below the sky. And He of hearts the saving Light, Our living Sun, within Whose rays A soul can bear the blackest night That deepens round misfortune's days, Alone He was; unseen, unheard, In vigil, fast, and awful fears; Few pangs He breathed through mortal word, But spake them by His blood-shed tears! At midnight, on calm mountains cold Awed angels might have heard Him pray; But not disciples could behold What suff'ring in His silence lay! And He who seeks a sacred heart, In solitude must learn to feel; Nor to the blushless world impart Those deeper thoughts the wise conceal. In lofty silence, sad and meek Thy cross confront, and bear it well; And if thy soul an echo seek, To Christ the hidden anguish tell: In thy lone chamber kneel, and pray Where none but God, and thou art nigh; And He who said,—“Our Father say,” Shall echo back thy deepest sigh. SENTIMENT OF FLOWERS. “As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.” Ps. ciii. 15. The Lord, who once celestial radiance threw Round the gay lilies in their regal dress, Hath long receded from the church's view, And Earth seems flow'ring in her loneliness: But still the Saviour's cry, “Behold!” remains Deep in the ear, and haunts the spring-toned breeze, Where pilgrim Thought along secluded plains Roams by the flowers, beneath romantic trees. Seems it, as though a consecration hung On the rich bloom of each innocuous flower, And grace beyond what minstrel Lyres have sung, Since Christ arrayed them with a teaching power. And they are beautiful as infant-eyes, Sparkling, or pale, when pensive, blue, or mild; Now, softly vocal, while the air-tone sighs, And then, in breezy motion dancing wild. And, like fair visions haunting Memory's dream, So to the serious mind may flowers impart In pale seclusion by some lisping stream, A graceful moral to the feeling heart. For oft like infants nursed on nature's breast The dawning buds come forth in sun and dew, Rosy as Childhood in rich beauty drest, When life enchants it with a fairy hue: And beaming Girlhood, in its beauteous grace, Seems like a new-blown flower in bloom to be, While fancy muses on that vernal face, And thinks, how soon that spring of heart will flee! And have not sentiment and soul-breathed song From flowers a classic inspiration caught?— Their spells of beauty to the bard belong, And grace his lines with many a lovely thought. In hoar'd cathedrals, solemn, huge, and grand, Where tombs have tongues, and eloquently preach, Who has not felt the wingèd mind expand Soaring to realms beyond mere earth to reach? There has Devotion traced those marble flowers Which still to fancy wear a stony bloom That triumphs o'er decay's funereal powers, On hero's cenotaph, and martyr's tomb. And since all matter should to mind attest Deep truths, significant of sacred worth, Are not the lilies, by their Maker drest, Types of the pure, unstain'd by sordid earth? Emblems of those, the gentle and the good, Plants of the Spirit, who delight to grow, And in the hush of thinking solitude Nurse the meek grace His will and word bestow? There is an air of chastity and calm Breathed from the pureness of a vestal flower, Soft as a breath from Eden's bloom and balm That shames coarse passion in its rudest hour. And when on couch of languishment there lies Some pale-worn victim of disease and pain, Oft can a flower relume the sunken eyes, As though they gazed on garden-walks again. Or, when the boy by Circumstance is led From the green hamlet where young life began, And 'mid the large loud city round him spread, For fields and groves, views artificial man, If some chance-flow'ret near his path should lie, How does it thrill association's law, Making the heart for home and country sigh, And tread the landscape rosy Childhood saw! So have I mark'd, amid some fever'd court Crowded with dens where degradations hide, Where passions vile with poverty resort, And orphan'd babes have hunger'd, wept, and died, Some lonely window, with a sickly flower Pining as pale, still struggling to endure, And thrill'd to think how Nature's lovely power Could thus the heart of wretchedness allure! Contemn not this: for in bleak haunts of woe Undying thoughts of sylvan life remain; And many a poor man, while his tear-drops flow, Hails a sad violet through a broken pane. We bless Thee, then, Thou Lord of flowers and trees! Bought by Whose Blood, the whole creation lives; Glowing with health, or martyr'd by disease, Hail, to each beauty Thine atonement gives! And when affection seeks the solemn grave To sprinkle flowers upon the guarded mould, Where in chill darkness sleep the perish'd brave Whose memories beautify the days of old, O Thou! the Resurrection and the Life, Thy viewless presence grant at this deep hour, And to sad mourners, with dejection rife, Reverse the emblem of that votive flower. “Behold the lilies!”—Lord, we would obey; But still they wither, while their charms delight; And in the lustre of their rich array Lurks the cold shadow of a coming blight: But thou, believer! not, like flowers, wilt fall Ne'er from the dust in blooming grace to rise; But when for thee, Earth's citing trump shall call, Eternal spring shall fascinate thine eyes. Celestial beauty, undecaying bloom Clothes the pure flesh with more than lilies wear; And thou, transplanted from the wintry tomb, Wilt bud in heaven, and flower with glory there. RECONCILIATION. “First be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”—Matt. v. 24. Pure glory of forgiving Love! Whose archetype exists above In God the reconciled; By nine degrees of soaring worth May our wing'd souls ascend from earth To Thee, the undefiled. Bootless are sacramental Forms, If in our hearts the hectic storms Of sullen anger dwell; Angels in mien, but Cains in mind, Men dare to dream their God too blind To see their bosom-hell! No mortal hate with love divine Can ever in one soul combine,— Deceit must both deprave; For love is that seraphic glow Which cannot chill before a foe, But tracks him to the grave. Proud thoughts create a mental war Nor let us see the truth we are, But hide from Self our sin; Aloud men cry o'er wrongs they feel, But all the wrongs they do, conceal Like pharisees within. Could we ourselves as clearly scan As we unshroud our brother man, How humbly might we walk! And never in the maddest hour When vile self-worship wields its power, Of our meek virtues talk. Let Conscience learn, the sharpest word Our ulcerated pride has heard Is tender, more than true; Since all that envious eyes can see, Is pure to what Divinity In man's vain heart can view. Thy temper soothe, thou ireful one! Nor ever may the west'ring sun Go down upon thy wrath; Thy brother seek, each fault confess, And with sad tones of mild distress Win all the love he hath. If by cold word, or thought, or deed Thy heart has caused his own to bleed, Promptly that ill repair; Nor dream that thus to condescend, Will one dark hue of meanness blend With aught thou feelest there. But if in soul, a sullen thought With scowling pride of anger fraught Toward friend or foe remain, Presume not, where Christ's altar stands To offer with polluted hands What Heaven must so disdain. First to a brother give thy heart; Let bitterness of soul depart, And then, that meal partake Where Love Incarnate bleeds and dies In His memorial sacrifice, Presented for thy sake. Fathom thy deeps of sinful mind, Keen to thyself, to others blind,— Be this thy noble plan! Beneath enamell'd smiles and ways Let Conscience dart her searching rays, And thou wilt pity man. Self-ignorance makes the spirit proud, And o'er clear error casts a cloud Of flatt'ry's genial power; But Self-illumed by heaven's own ray Can melt that painted mist away, And humble ev'ry hour. Vain hypocrites, and worse than vile If passions dark our soul defile And fiendish thoughts are nursed, While outwardly in church and creed We call ourselves a “holy seed,” By God we are accursed! Heaven's lineage must heaven's likeness wear, And not alone by praise and prayer Authentic worship prove; When Faith beholds her God of grace, The brightest Feature she can trace Is that which glows with love. Then, grant us, Lord, a heart like Thine As deep in mercy, as divine, Celestial, mild, and true; And learn we all, the more we live, The godlike must like God forgive All daring Wrong can do. Creation seems instinct with love, A parable of His above, Father, and Friend of all; And not a rain-drop Earth renews And not a sunbeam lights her hues Which does not grace recall. O'er just and unjust, what a shower Of raining mercies falls each hour, Bought by atoning Blood! From Whose vast merit all that is, Derives each energizing bliss Which makes our common good. Two Bibles thus our hearts may teach A pure sublime of man to reach, In love for friend and foe, Since Nature, like the Gospel, pours O'er “good and evil” all her stores, That each may Godhead know. ANGELIC MINISTRY. “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?” —Heb. i. 14. “He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”—Ps. xci. 11. “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” —Ps. xxxiv. 7. Say, why do sceptic hearts decline In nature more than earth to view? We cannot trace the word divine, But angel-forms attend us through: Salvation's heirs they watch and keep Both when they wake, and while they sleep. And how could perill'd infants rove Light as elastic breezes play, Secure as if in heaven above They tripp'd along some crystal way, Unless beloved by angel-powers Who hover round their fleeting hours? All Nature feels a lovely awe Environing the aidless child; And fancy dreams her iron law Before it grows relax'd and mild; E'en the stern brute a babe will spare; And why?—some angel watches there. When shepherds on the midnight-plain Of Judah kept their flocks at night, Who hymn'd that heaven-reecho'd strain At which applauding Worlds grow bright, But angels, whose ethereal tongue The glorious Incarnation sung? And when the Fiend of darkness tried To wrestle down that perfect will, By which the Prince of Peace defied His threefold power of lying ill, Behold! yon Seraph leaves his throne To soothe Him when the fiend had flown. But, turn to dread Gethsemane; That garden pall'd with spectral gloom Where, bow'd with wordless agony Messiah bled, before his doom, That bloody sweat,—that crimson dew Which strain'd His tortured spirit through! E'en then, from yon bright Host above A sympathetic angel came, And o'er him warbled tones of love Which dropt like balm upon His frame; For, dread to think!—imputed sin Convulsed His finite soul within. But when before the radiant morn The Lord of Resurrection rose, Winding the grave-clothes Death had worn, As though just risen from repose, Two angels watch'd, as guardians meet, Where lay His awful head and feet. And like a sunburst from the south On wings of archangelic sheen, To roll from that sepulchral mouth The rocky stone where Christ had been,— Two Creatures of celestial might Came speeding down from worlds of light. So when at length Emmanuel soar'd And left His loved disciples' view, While their ascending glance adored The Lord, who back to heaven withdrew, What bounding hopes within them burn When angels say, “He shall return!” INFANT FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. “Hid from the wise and prudent ? revealed unto babes.”—Matt. xi. 25. Mysterious infant! on thy fairy brow A far-off glory seems reflected now, A pensive, mild, and melancholy ray Like the last hue of heaven's most lovely day; Thou living harebell! 'mong the human flowers Which bud and blossom in domestic bowers, The liquid azure of thy placid eye Gleams like the softness of a vernal sky: Feeble to sense and sight indeed thou art, But oh! within thee dwells a mighty Heart, Capacious of eternity, and God, E'en now, before the travell'd earth is trod. Fragile the organs that connect thy soul With those blent world-scenes, which our own control; But let not creedless Science this declare,— That God and angels are unvision'd there. Souls in pure essence are, like grace, unknown; For all we hear is but the outward tone, A broken echo of a voice within Muffled by earth, and jarr'd by jangling sin: But if The Spirit must a soul renew Ere glory open on its blissful view, Then must the babe unbreathed communion hold And have with Heaven some intercourse untold. Sinless in fact, untempted babes depart To where, O Christ, ensphered in bliss Thou art; And ere time's language to their lips is known, They learn The Cross before salvation's throne. And who remembers not some deep-eyed child, Unearthly, pale, and exquisitely mild, Purer than chisell'd alabaster shines Where sculptured poesy hath traced its lines? But 'tis not beauty, delicate and bright, Nor limbs elastic as incarnate light, Nor that seraphic grace of brow and cheek More eloquent of mind, than words can speak: 'Tis something finer than all beauty far, Tender as dreams beneath a twilight-star; A heaven-like stamp of saintliness which glows O'er each calm feature in its chaste repose. And who denies, prophetic babes may see Secrets and Shapes which throng eternity, Visions of glory, such as elder man Has never imaged in the course he ran? A wordless infant in some mystic hour May have The Spirit in His deeper power, Converse with angels, and in God behold Truths which heroic Saints have never told. The tearful radiance of a baby's eye, The pleading music of its pensive sigh, The looks that seem so spiritually deep Turn'd on beholders, till they almost weep, May be the symbols of a faded heaven To infants in angelic slumber given, Which leaves them, when they face the world again, In dim remembrance and in dawning pain. And none can tell, but hov'ring babes above To babes on earth may whisper tones of love, Melodious fragments of cherubic song On Glory's breeze for ever borne along. And, childless mother! let a thought like this Becalm thy bosom with sustaining bliss,— When thy pale infant heaved the parting sigh Some Angel bore it to the peopled sky. Bright from the waters of baptismal life, Stain'd by no sin, nor touch'd by earth-born strife, Straight to its God thy sinless babe hath flown And join'd the myriads which enwreathe His Throne. THE SINGLE EYE. “If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”—Matt. vi. 22. Though ruin'd, deathless man is noble still, In whom fair lines and lineaments remain Of all he was,—ere sin by lawless will Cast on the glorious Soul a guilty stain; And not with harsh irreverence should we dare One trace despise, which Heaven has treasured there. As round a gloomy shrine, in grand decay Where crumbling arch and ruin'd pillar fall, Remnants of beauty yet the pile array And the dead sculpture into life recall, When sacred fancy with religious eye Dreams in the ages of a World gone by,— So, 'mid the sinful waste of man perverse Faint hues and harmonies of Eden dwell, Not all remanded by the righteous curse Which on the forfeit-state of Adam fell: Round the sad ruin of his fallen soul Shadows divine of vanish'd Glory roll. But if by earth-fed passion, lust, or pride, Greedy of gain, or gorged with self-esteem, Majestic reason is just power denied, The central life becomes a ghastly dream, Where all our faculties and functions blend In dread confusion, which can never end. For then, Incarnate Wisdom so declares, That which by nature should our light become, And starlike, lead us through the night of cares Which deepens round us till we reach our home, Itself is darkness! and the beam that glows Is that which Falsehood to blind feeling shows: How great the “darkness,” not e'en Christ hath said! As though such midnight of the mind surpass'd Whate'er rebellion of the heart or head By finite language can be call'd, or class'd:— “Darkness” that e'en from Him a wonder drew, To Whom no sight in earth, or hell, was new! Single the Eye, when jealous conscience guards Its vestal chastity by prayer and truth, And not to Reason, but to Grace awards Those inward laws which hallow age and youth,— Those godlike principles by which men live, And the dread Soul to its own Author give. Resist we, then, the sorceries of sin; The lust of income and the love of power Cloud the clear Eye, whose vision acts within And ought to rule and rectify each hour: So will our reason, with no jaundiced gaze, Interpret duty through a blinding haze. Religious principle and moral code Diseased by passion, most perversely act; And Vice, recoiling from heaven's narrow road, Dares its own decalogue of Self enact: Our way is hell-ward, though we heed it not, Sinai renounced, and Calvary forgot. Oh! better far be reasonless and mad, Than thus transform the rectifying Guide Which God ordain'd to govern good and bad, And legislate on virtue's lovely side; For, when distorted, conscience proves a curse Whose cruel wisdom makes condition worse. As though the needle in its compass were Reversely guiding o'er a sea of gloom The storm-heaved ship, while lurid tempests glare, And ocean blackens like a billowy tomb;— Her wreck is fated though she proudly rides In foaming triumph o'er the furious tides! Nor dream that when by damning vice depraved, The central light of reas'ning conscience fails To warn the victim of desires enslaved, Corrective Wisdom o'er such doom prevails:— An Archimedes in the world of mind Who fix'd his lever and hath raised mankind, If not with him the single eye and pure For sacred guardianship of soul remain,— His teachings prove but spell-words to allure The hearts which hear them, into vice and pain: The rays of Genius, when to darkness turn'd, What fiendish laurels have they found, and earn'd! Spirit of wisdom! pure and perfect Light, Come from Thy region of celestial grace, Through the bad gloom of unbelieving night Dart the mild beams of Thy majestic face: By loving Thee, saints learn to grow divine, And as they live, resemble Thee, and Thine. That single Eye, which God and glory views, Whose seeing power by holiness is keen, And doth o'er all things Christ supremely choose,— Be this our wisdom in life's perill'd scene; So shall we vanquish, by enduring, ill, And find it heaven to do our Father's will. MY FIRST-BORN. [C. H. E. M. BORN MAY 4TH, 1848.] “The Lord spake, Sanctify unto me all the first-born; it is mine.”—Exod. xiii. 2. My first-born! when I heard thy faint low cry, Home to the heart was echoing nature stirr'd With more than man can tell by tear, or sigh, Or Fondness image through a shaping word; For Life is deeper than our language far, And dimly mirrors but the half we are. The fountains in the inward deep of soul Seem'd broken up with preternat'ral start, And onward gush'd with sweetest uncontrol The new-born raptures of a parent's heart: Each chord of feeling trembled like a tone Which haunts the harpstring, when the hand is flown. How shall I doat upon thy dawning smile When conscious reason first begins to play! And watch the beauty of each dimpling wile Clothing thy cheek with what the lip would say, Were but the gladness of thy spirit heard In the lisp'd cadence of some little word. Holy is childhood! through that lovely age Incarnate Mercy did not shun to live, And thereby circled life's commencing stage With halo pure as innocence could give,— A charm which consecrates an infant now, When the first Sacrament bedews its brow. Nor doubt, the infant Christ at mother's knee The priceless volume of celestial Love Conn'd day by day,—that parents hence might see How lisping babes ascend to truth above; Nurtur'd for heaven as their young spirits grow, By wisdom strengthen'd in this world of woe. Nor let some Cain-like reason coldly ask How with the mind of some unspeaking child Regenerate Love can ply its living task, And to the heart teach lessons undefiled?— Baptismal grace exceeds what eyes discern, And more than Science dreams, a babe may learn. Think how Emmanuel, when man's world He walk'd, Stoop'd to those little ones, who round Him came; And when of more than angels knew He talk'd, Anthem'd with high-toned joy God's mystic name, Because what hoary Sages oft refuse, That for some nursling God's free-will doth choose. So with a sacredness from heaven decreed My first-born! by the Church environ'd round, May the blest Spirit help thy dawning need From hallow'd stores, which in His breast abound, Who e'en in glory can remember still How on sad earth He felt each infant thrill. Lamb of the flock! within thy Saviour's fold Calm may'st thou roam, by living pastures green 'Mid waters bright,—with footstep never bold, Follow The Shepherd through life's destined scene; Thou wilt not want, if He become thy guide. With rod of love and staff of grace supplied. Coil'd in the secret of His purpose vast Firstling of Hope! thine unread future lies, But should thy doom for ripening years be cast And thou be spared to light enamour'd eyes, How will maternal Fondness round thee twine, And my heart gladden when it dreams of thine! To aid thy lip Christ's glorious name to speak, And hear thy sweet mouth lisp its little prayer; To watch emotions mirror'd on thy cheek When first religion is reflected there, While with lock'd hands of reverential love Thou kneel'st to ask a blessing from above,— By soft degrees to view thee conscious grow Of God and nature, mind, and scene, and man, Gently to chide each fault, and calm each woe As only echoing hearts of parents can,— Delights like these will anxious toil repay, And sun my spirit with perpetual ray. And should my darling add to loveliness A frame responsive to those fine appeals, Which earth's dumb eloquence doth aye impress On each who nature's living poem feels, With sacred rapture shall I watch thee try To read God's epic, in the glorious sky! But oh, of joys the brightest, purest, best Will that be found,—when first thy budding mind Words of redeeming grace and truth arrest And glorify thy love for human kind; Or when thy broken accents would explain What Childhood feels for God's incarnate pain. But these are dreams:—and voiceless omens creep Round my chill'd Spirit, when it looks on thee, Making the moist eye almost bend and weep O'er the veil'd depths of hush'd futurity; For soft dejection in thine infant-gaze, Like dim prediction, seems to tell thy days. God shield thee, darling!—like a dewdrop now, In radiant freshness on the tree of Life Trembles thy being; but with prescient brow I darkly ponder, lest disease and strife Crush thy soft nature, now so fair and frail, And bid thee into death at once exhale. Mysterious God! should this deep trial come And thou, my first-born, find the infant's grave, Long ere thy sire, shouldst thou be summon'd home And heaven remand the treasure that it gave, Oh! teach me, Lord, this awful prayer to say,— “Blest be His name, who gives, and takes away!” JUDGE NOT. “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”—Matt. vii. 1. Eye of the Lord! in whose omniscient ray Our motives play, Like motes in sunbeams, each distinctly bare, Can sinners dare Rash judgment o'er that secret heart to strain, Where Thou dost reign Alone,—from Whom no buried thoughts are hid? Men are forbid To scan a brother with censorious eye; Or sternly cry, “Let me the mote from out thy vision draw,” As though they saw With holy clearness of unclouded view The pure and true: While in their eye-glance dwells one sinful beam Men little deem, How all who virtue love, will strive to be From sin set free. A flagging will, a feeble mind To Glory dead and Wisdom blind; A neutral cowardice of heart That shrinks from taking noble part, When Christ, and Church and Creed demand The prowess true of heart and hand,— Lord! not for these Thy words assign The guerdon Faith believes divine, When Thou dost bid each duteous mind Abstain from judging mortal kind. The truth must e'er the falsehood fight, While wrong pursues the hated right; And they are craven to the Cross Who quail for dread of earthly loss; Or else, because the coward Will Recoils from rude oppressive ill, Refrain from branding sin and crime; And so caress the vassal time That vice and virtue, false and true Become the heart's chameleon hue! Avaunt! such antinomian Ease, Whose gospel is self-will to please. But, come ye Inspirations given Fresh from the heart of Christ in heaven! Mild Charity, and modest Thought, And Meekness with Devotion fraught; With radiant Candour, rich in love, And motherly, as born above, Which, mindful of Redemption's plan, Embraces universal man. The perfect Judge is God alone; And he usurps His legal Throne Who rashly dares to pierce and scan Those spirit-fibres of the man— Motives! which are of acts the soul, And subject to Divine Control: By man unprobed, in all their change They move within His mental range, By Whom is mark'd the embryo sin, Ere yet 'tis born the soul within. But e'en when action, motive, thought Are into clear exposure brought, And all which meets our human gaze Harrows the soul with stern amaze, Man must not wield the judge's rod, Or make himself the bar of God. Love in that light, oh! let there be By which our hearts a brother see; Since, blind and partial are we, when Hurt feelings try our fellow-men. Be merciful! for sinners all Are they, who Christ their glory call; Such Minds can weep where others frown, To see how soon we wander down Those sad descents of worldly sin Which tempt without, and try within.— The holy are the humble, too; Rather in silence will they rue The faults and failings brethren show, Nor be the first a stone to throw. Their sin we view; but not the strife Or writhings of that inward-life Where passion, conscience, and desire In some convulsive mood conspire: Nor can we measure with just mind How circumstance with choice combined; Or mad temptation, swift and wild, Tore like a fiend the heart defiled; Or, how resistance unto prayer Fought with the Crime which conquer'd there. O God! before Whose perfect eye Are cloud-stains on the crystal sky, Were we but judged by those degrees By which malign Suspicion sees A brother in his conduct fail,— E'en martyrs would the Judgment wail. Rather, through love's kind error, be Victim of fond credulity, Than like some cold and cutting blast Which near the frozen Sea hath past, Breathe o'er thy brother words that wring The soul with unvoiced suffering. Come then, celestial Archetype for all, To Thee we call; And ere the bolt of Censure can descend On foe, or friend, Oh, introvert the spirit's eye, to scan Our inward man. For thus, what boundless error should we see In us to be! The arm reversed would then no censure throw On friend, or foe; But, as dark evils which deserve a stone, Would brand our own. AWFULNESS OF SPEECH. “By thy words shalt thou be justified.”—Matt. xii. 37. We ought to dread what Speech can do, And mortal words have done, As vain or vile, or false or true, Since Language first begun: For speech the soul can so empower, For fiends', or angels' work, That Death, or Life, each dawning hour, Within some tone may lurk. A speechless thought innocuous seems To all except the Mind, Through whose vague depths it acts, or dreams For self, or for mankind; But when abroad, by speech, or press, Our Thoughts their course begin, Conception cannot dare to guess What conquest they may win. Through regions, empires, heart and home, A trackless Thing it hies, And through eternity will roam,— For Influence never dies. To counsel, flatter, charm, or cheer, How potent human speech! To summon smiles, or mould a tear, To pray, rebuke, or preach,— Thus life and death within the spell Of living words reside, And blest are they, who wield them well, Rememb'ring Him who “sighed!” And why? Because the Saviour knew That since our primal Fall No tongues are to their glory true, Except on God they call. Eye, Ear, and Speech, each organ may A ban or blessing prove, According as we learn to lay Their service out in love. Thus did Emmanuel sigh to know, That when Compassion gave To dumbness power the mind to show, From sin it would not save, But might hereafter frequent tempt His tongue to many a crime, That, but for speech, had proved exempt In silence half sublime. He mark'd the victim, mute and sad Who thus before Him stood, And cried “Be open,” not “Be glad,” Though speech itself were good. And so with us: 'twere better far As dumb and deaf to be, Unless in spoken life we are From worded vileness free. And never may we speak, or write A word which others know, Unless 'twill bear His searching light, From whom all speech doth flow. Let that deep sigh the God-man drew, Around us swell and heave, And when we utter words untrue That sigh will make us grieve. LET US PRAY. “If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?”—Matt. vii. 11. All that of Eden now remains Lives in the lovely page of God, Where o'er green earth a beauty reigns As when by Christ at evening trod; Oh! were it not for this pure story, Our hearts might scarce conceive the glory Which still that paradise of words arrays With all those hues of heaven, which spellbound Adam's gaze. The weed, the thistle, and the thorn, And stooping Labour's moisten'd brow, Are types and tokens men are born Under the primal ruin now; The kingly mind of innocence Seems crush'd by sin's omnipotence; And riper passions round our virtues prey, And with envenom'd tooth begnaw their strength away. But still beneath man's ruin lives One feeling, which survived the Fall,— That which parental fondness gives To those who hear their children call: Men are not fiends, but still reply Like echoes, to each filial cry A son puts forth in some beseeching hour, When lisping Childhood yearns for parent's guardian power. Divine emotion! deep as pure; Without thee, Scripture breathes a tone Which could not alien hearts allure To bend before the Mercy-throne: But when “Our Father!” thence is heard, Dead feelings in their tomb are stirr'd; And like the ladder joining earth and skies, They form attractive steps, by which to heaven we rise. And thus hath Christ affections used When pleading oft with prayerless mind, And shown that, though by sin abused, There is a law that wields mankind, By which parental natures prove The throbbings of eternal Love, When Hunger seeks them with dejected cry,— “Food for thy famish'd child! or he must die.” And, Lord, if thus the sin-worn heart So much of paradise retain, Why dare we doubt in heaven Thou art Responsive to each prayer-breathed strain? Did Faith but ask, and knock, and scek, What giants would become the weak! And Conscience realise Thy love as true As when its death-gasp groan'd, “Forgive them what they do.” Could men but feel, how constant prayer Sustains the most heroic Mind, Their life would be one holy care A Father-God in heaven to find; Not as a Judge, with iron brow, Before Him would they bend and vow; But from the deeps of man's parental heart Gather some loving gleams of what, O God! Thou art. Saviour of souls! our Truth and Way, Bread for the famish'd hearts which pine, Instruct us like Thyself to pray “Father! Thy will be done, not mine.”— Tender has been the tearful thought A babe-cry to some mother brought; But far more tender is The Heart above Whose echoing depths repeat the name of holy “Love.” DIVINE FAITHFULNESS. “The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee.”—Isa. liv. 10. The mountains shall from earth depart, The hills may be removed, But thou of God elected art And as a “bride” beloved; Our God as soon might cease to be, As break His covenant with thee. Election flows from no high worth In fallen souls foreseen; For where is good on this bad earth Which free grace hath not been? Did God demand prevenient love, Heaven would not shrine one soul above. Thou barren Heart! which hast not borne The hopes that make thee sing, Oh, dream not thou art left forlorn In widow'd suffering: For like a wife in youth forsaken, Back to thy Lord shalt thou be taken. Though toss'd on life's tempestuous sea Affliction's waves run high, For one small moment Heaven from thee Averts its loving eye,— Yet, soon will mercy's overflow Around thine anguish brightly glow. No crisis can our God subdue, No change His will surprise; Close to His ancient counsel true His grace for ever lies; The “Lord of Hosts” reveals His name In love eternal, and the same. He does not find a lovely thing And love what He discerns; But His pure love becomes the spring Of what in martyrs burns Of holy passion, zeal, and prayer By God's own Spirit kindled there. Then, courage! torn and troubled Mind, The Glorious One appears; Nor let Dejection leave thee blind With her impassion'd tears: Soon shall thy blest Redeemer come And guide thee safe to Glory's home. No weapon'd hand its deadly wound Shall in thy spirit make; Nor all the raging tongues around That bond of goodness break Which God in Christ for thee doth hold, And His deep heart of grace enfold. With sapphires thy foundations fair Shall soon by Him be laid; Nor shall oppressive Wrong be there, As though thou wert betray'd: Terrors themselves shall learn to fear A kingly saint to Godhead dear. The Spirit's love, a love divine Though earth and heaven decay, Is true, O Lord! to Thee and Thine Though worlds dissolve away; Had Souls true faith, they could not dread The deepest midnight round them spread. A dying world for dying men For saints hath Heaven decreed, And wisely plans the where, and when, Each burden'd heart must bleed; But, Love this truth can understand,— Each blow is from a Father's hand. And thus, if fortune, home, and friend, And social bliss, no more Around us their rich magic blend As they were wont of yore,— Reflected on our falling tears The iris of God's love appears. Timeless and changeless is the plan Before all worlds begun, From whence that mercy reacheth man Incarnate Merit won:— Though toss'd, and by the tempest shaken, Believer, thou art unforsaken! REVERE THE DEAD. “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.” Rev. xiv. 13. Pity the dead!—nay, rather mourn for those Who battle on through Life's harsh scene of care, In whose grieved breast the thorn of trial grows, While in the crowd all echoless they are: Bearing some poison'd shaft within the heart They feel, bad World! the hollowness thou art. Pity the dead!—no, rather weep for them Who on vex'd earth must suffer, toil, and sin, And pray, their passion's burning tide to stem And keep close watch o'er waywardness within; Who hour by hour repentance must renew, And mourn how little for their Lord they do. But oh! the dead, the justified and saved, Children of glory, wrapt in Jesu's arms, The darkness of the sepulchre they braved And there are shielded safe from Earth's alarms; Pure in the brightness of ethereal bliss, They would not change it for a scene like this! The spirits of the Just, made perfect now, Have each in heaven their beatific calm; Serenity arrays each kingly Brow, And through each Heart distils celestial balm; Their hope as cloudless as the peace divine,— Seraphic visions round them reign, and shine. And He is there! the kingdom's Light and Lord, Who out of time and toil has call'd them home, And now fulfils each wise and glorious word True faith believed, when doom'd on earth to roam,— E'en Christ, who beautifies the Spirit-throngs, 'Mid their deep worship of adoring songs. But, ah! fond Nature, in thy bosom yearn Feelings which oft our passive faith o'erflow; And with such flame intense affections burn That time, nor truth, can quench their secret glow; Down the deep heart some unvoiced thoughts remain, And bid us sigh to see our Dead again. “My beautiful, my bright, my darling child! Her smile was eloquent with soul to me;” Thus the wan mother in her anguish wild Echoes the regions of eternity, When round the heart-strings thrills the seeming breath Of some loved daughter, tomb'd in early death. “And thou, my dead, my unforgotten boy! Prop of our home, and pillar of our race, Genius was thine, and brow of princely joy, And more than beauty clothed thy classic face; How did I dote, and for thy future build Schemes which parental hearts alone have fill'd.”— So grieves a sire, when Love's ideal hours Roll their sad cadence o'er his dreaming brain, When the dead Past resumes a living power And with such resurrection smiles again, That hand in hand his child he seems to hold, And hear the Voice that lull'd him so of old. And thou, lone sister! who pale watch didst keep Night after night, around some fairy child, Marking each dimple which in rosy sleep Sunn'd the pure face, as though an angel smiled, When Death withdrew it to th' unseen abode, Thy heart to madness almost overflow'd. But, peace! fond mourners: calm your souls to rest, The Dead you weep are still alive to Him, Lord of those mansions, where the bright and blest Are pure and peaceful as the seraphim; No sin infects, nor sorrow clouds that scene Where the saved dead since Adam's death have been. Here, while we travel through the dust of time Dark imperfections oft the soul defile; Whate'er the circumstance, or change, or clime, Creation's noblest is but vain and vile: What are our woods and fields, our mountains, glens, and streams, To God's bright landscape, which in glory beams? Then, hush thy moan, Affection! curb thy will; Think of the dead as to perfection brought, In heart all holy, as the conscience still Feels the rich calm the “Blood of Sprinkling” wrought:— No cloud to tinge the colour of their days, They harp the anthem of redemption's praise. Dead though their forms in dust sepulchral lie, Ecstatic faith the spirit loves to view, And longs to vision with prophetic eye What awful raptures must pervade it through, As more and more eternity unfolds Secrets of Glory, vast as heaven beholds. POWER OF THE REDEEMER'S EYE. “The Lord looked ? and Peter went out and wept bitterly!”—Luke xxii. 61, 62. Not poet's lyre, nor painter's line Could e'er express that look of Thine, Saviour of men! on craven Peter cast:— Eternity was in Thy gaze, And through dark conscience darted rays Which lighten'd into truth his present, and his past. Deep eloquence was there, Beyond the lightning-glare Red with the fierceness of the flaming storm; Nor might loud hurricanes which sweep In thund'ring air-tones o'er the deep Till the rent ocean heaves like agonizing forms, So terribly the soul appal As that one gaze in Pilate's hall Shook to his moral root a recreant man! Apostate as he there denied That Lord, to Whom his worship cried, “Though all desert Thee, Christ! my spirit never can.” Dungeon, nor death, nor chains, Nor all which persecution gains, Should tempt him from The Truth to fly; Though all betray'd Him, he would stand Faithful among a faithless band, And boldly for His Lord exult to bleed, or die! Resolve then reign'd in ardent power; And feeling hued that full-toned hour With the rich colour hearts delight to show, In some rapt mood when men appear Sublimed above unhallow'd fear, And with celestial warmth reflect an angel's glow. In such high noon of seraph-zeal, Our breasts an inspiration feel Lifting us far beyond each low-born aim; Wing'd thoughts surmount the walls of time, And waft us to that world sublime Where Heaven's clear arches ring with Christ's resounded name. But He, to Whom all hearts lie bared, In that flush'd moment then declared How thrice, e'er yet the wakeful bird would crow, The saint who seem'd so nobly fired As if by heaven's own warmth inspired, Vanquish'd by shameful dread,—would all his vows forego! And more or less than Man were he Unmoved who in this hour could see A brave Apostle from His banner fly: Assaulted by Satanic power And sifted in that searching hour, Thrice did his caitiff mouth the Lord of Love deny! If mortal pain could mar the rest Which broods within an angel's breast, Sure might St. Peter's crime have drawn his tear,— Who swore with ireful oath untrue He ne'er the blest Redeemer knew, And sacrificed his vow upon the shrine of fear. But, while a third denial hung With impious accent on his tongue, Behold! the crowing of the cock began; And back with its reverted gaze Bedimm'd with more than tearful haze, Look'd the calm Eye of Christ on that apostate man! He “look'd,”—oh, what a look was there Of pity, love, rebuke, and prayer! Angelic, human, and divine the spell Wielded by Christ in that dread gaze Which then on Peter poured its rays, Till down his weeping heart before it writhed, and fell! 'Twas but a glance, and yet it cleaved The veil asunder, which had weaved A hiding darkness round that trait'rous heart: It open'd each vile gulf within Where lurk the powers of latent sin, And made him from himself to shudder back, and start. By day, by night, where'er he went, As o'er his head the firmament, Thus o'er his heart with holiness and light That piercing glance of Jesu cast Celestial power, where'er he pass'd, And overarch'd his soul with meaning, and with might. 'Twas with him, when he watch'd or wept, Or fasted, toil'd, or woke, or slept; Hunger'd and roofless, wearied, rack'd and worn,— By shore, or sea, abroad, at home, Where'er his pilgrim zeal could roam, Here was the guiding Star, that watch'd him, though forlorn. In prison, and o'er chains, it threw A glory which that angel knew, Who saw his features radiant in repose, When calm as cradled infant's breath He slept upon the brink of death, In some fond dream of Christ, forgetful of his woes. And will not fond Devotion say, That when his form inverted lay In bleeding anguish on the cross oppress'd, That still the gaze from Jesu's eye Beam'd on his soul, till life's last sigh Wafted the spirit home to its loved Saviour's breast? But in this page of man may we, As in some truthful mirror see Reflected warnings, which may well o'erawe The boldest, who believe they stand Like rocks of faith, in self-command, As did Saint Peter once, before his heart he saw. There while he weeps a bitter shower Of anguish in this rueful hour, Lord of our spirits! may his teardrops fall In healthful virtue o'er each heart, That little dreams how Satan's art To more than Peter's crime may soon betray us all. Yea, doth not our baptismal vow Bend o'er us like a burden now, And crush pale conscience into sacred tears? For, leagued with flesh, and fiend, and world, Oh, have we not to nothing hurl'd The awful promise made,—that God should have our years? For gold, or pride, or pomp, and pleasure As though they form'd divinest treasure, How basely have we barter'd mind and will! Betraying our predestined cross, That we should count our life a loss, Except for Christ we lived, self-crucified and still. Sole Healer of the wounded heart! Who now ensphered in glory art, When Peter-like, our prostrate vows we break, Let no red lightnings of Thy wrath Flash their dread fury o'er our path, Nor regal thunder-tones Thy terrors o'er us wake,— But turn Thee with subduing eye, And from Thy bliss beyond the sky Look, as Thou didst on Thine apostle's fears: So melt us into anguish true, Till Penitence our treason rue And bathe Thy mercy-seat with love's remorseful tears. THE GATES OF LIFE. “Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction ? strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life.”—Matt. vii. 13, 14. Grief, more than revelation tells, Shaded The Lord of Glory's heart, Where slept within its aching cells Deep woes no earth-breathed words impart; Pure is the Bible, and a perfect book,— But Christ had depths where Language could not look! All echoless by worded sign Some buried pangs there must have been; And saint, nor angel can divine What pass'd behind that mental screen Where in dread myst'ry, voiceless, lone, and deep, Pale thoughts of Christ did o'er man's future weep. Tongue cannot speak, nor soul conceive The gloom which blacken'd o'er His mind, When thoughts prophetic bade him grieve O'er sinful wrecks of sad mankind; Sorrow like this might soften hearts of stone, But, ah! how infinite His pangs unknown! For each lost soul the bloody sweat And crimson tide of anguish flow'd, And in His righteous spirit met All penal claims to justice owed, For sins beyond what mortal numbers count,— So vast the myriads of their vile amount! But more He felt, who bled for man, When from His cross uprear'd on earth His Prescience saw that sacred plan By angels deem'd of priceless worth, Attract but “few,” for whom His Mercy died, To bear the cross, and love the Crucified. Of all dark burdens which oppress And crush warm spirits into woe, Ingratitude from those we bless Outweighs the direst hearts can know; Fiends may abhor, but never can betray The Souls which trust, and for them toil and pray. But how did uncreated Love A sacrifice divine achieve! When God emerged from light above, Around His awful head to weave A thorny crown, this forfeit-world to save, And roll'd thick darkness from the hideous grave. Yet, when the unborn Ages rose Before Him, in His parting breath, And He beheld what creedless foes Would still deny His priestly death, A deeper sadness must have pierced His heart, Than all which sacrificial pangs impart. Two paths He saw, two gates appear'd, Contracted one, the other wide; Along the last, unfelt, unfear'd, What myriads rush'd, for whom He died!— Broad as their wills, and wild as Passion's law The way of ruin which for them He saw. But o'er that strict and narrow way So wisely hemm'd by holy Truth, He mark'd a sainted number stray, Faithful as few, to age from youth; Such are the souls, who count this World no loss When they have nail'd it to th' atoning cross. So is it now, to saints who read The moral scenes of tempted man, By that pure light blest angels need Before they learn the mystic plan, Whereby the wisdom of God's secret Will Winds its clear way through vice, and virtue still, Ambition's fretting pride of thought, The Hero's falsely-worshipp'd fame, With all that mock Renown hath wrought To gild the nothing of a name,— Are baseless dreams, unsanctified and vile, And only blast the victims they beguile. Learning, and Art, and lofty Mind, Unless beneath the Cross they grow, Prove but mere forms of Self refined, Whose “broad way” leads to final woe; Sin changes not, howe'er by spells array'd, And out of Christ, what are we, but betray'd? “Broad is the way,”—oh, crushing thought! Which must have made Emmanuel sigh, To see the Soul His anguish bought But live to sin, and love to die,— Enter the “wide gate” with a maniac glee, And quench bad mirth in glooms of agony! “Narrow the path,”—but, yet it leads To Life's consummate goal of bliss; And though their self-denial bleeds, Children of light will enter this; Though few in number, round their heavenward ways Hover the glorious Dead of elder days. O'er such high path decreed by God, Led by The Spirit, let me roam; For where my Saviour's feet have trod Bright footprints point me to His home,— That City clothed with more than crystal rays, Her gates salvation, and whose walls are praise. Patriarch and prophet, priest and saint, Denial's road to heaven preferr'd; And when their sunken hearts grew faint, They listen'd for that living Word Which warbled round them in the deepest night, “My yoke is easy, and my burden light!” SPIRITUAL DECLINE. “Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; when his candle shined upon my head ? when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle.”—Job xxix. ii. 2–4. “Oh! that with me, as in the months of yore, My heart were basking in the smile of God, When all I saw the sweet impression bore His eye o'erwatch'd me through the way I trod. “Then did the candle of Jehovah beam With loving radiance o'er my rising hours, And life roll'd onward like a happy stream Which carols music to the list'ning flowers. “Bright with the dews of pure devotion, lay My spirit open to each breath from heaven; And all who saw me, in their hearts might say,— Dead paradise re-blooms in sin forgiven! “Precious was Christ! beyond angelic speech In might or melody to e'er reveal; Nor could the songs of sainted rapture reach All His incarnate glories made me feel. “Dear was the temple, and the hour of prayer, And dear the spirit of that ritual Whole When all my faculties were hallow'd there, And heaven seem'd dawning on my inmost soul. “And when the emblems of embodied Love Bleeding for man, to my awed sense were brought, Like Stephen, view'd I in the world above The Christ, by whom a sacrament is wrought.”— Thus moans in secret many a voiceless heart Heavy with gloom, and harrow'd by distress; Dull, cold, or dead, as grace and gift depart And leave the sad One to his loneliness. Yet, dark believer! may such woeful strain Issue from shades of cowardice and sin; And what thou dreamest a majestic pain, May prove the sign of hollowness within! There is a trinity in mortal time By past, by present, and by future made; And, Conscience wields a potency sublime When each before her stands, in truth array'd. Then must we feel how time's divisions mould One character, in which our fate will rest; Eternity in seed we thus behold As heaven, or hell, now ripens in the breast! Oh, then, not idly, with a weak lament Sigh o'er some privilege, which breathes no more; Religion scorns a laggard discontent That feebly sickens in pale dreams of yore. Not grace from thee, but thou from God hast gone, By cold illapse declining day by day; Or from the paths which lead true virtue on Turn'd into tracks which tempt the soul away. Cold in thy prayer, in praise reluctant grown, Seldom at church, the Eucharist forgot, Thy creed, self-will, no master but thine own,— Behold! the secret which explains thy lot. Obedience is religion's breath of life; Constant and pure denials must we bear; Each day should be with crucifixion rife, Each hour be hallowed with the soul of prayer. Saints learn by loving, and by love they live; Who walk with God, must from themselves depart; And Peace descends not from her Prince above, Except for God faith purify the heart. Mourners in Zion oft are minds which fail To hold their Master's cross supreme in view; Or let some lust o'er discipline prevail That renders them to church, and creed untrue. Thus, like a secret rust the world begins Eating its way, until our hearts corrode; Pleasure and profit veil their inward sins, And wide as passion seems the “narrow” road. From virgin youthfulness the Soul declines When from both God and grace it dares to roam, And can no longer through the Word Divine Shelter the heart, in true affection's home. “Oh! that with me as in pure moments past My God were present,”—vain such cry, indeed, Unless Repentance thy worn spirit cast Low at the mercy-seat to lie, and bleed. Leave sigh and sentiment for Duty's cross, Haste thee to works of sacrifice and prayer; Count a gain'd world to be a gloomy loss And prize hereafter as thy holy care: So may the smile of Godhead back return Effulging o'er thee, as in days of old; Dead in thyself, to live in Jesu learn, And round His throne God's covenant behold. Earth, sense, and time will more and more recede, Conscience be cleansed, and childlike prayer arise; Eternity will grow thy grandest need, God be thy goal, and heaven thy genial prize. GUIDING TENDERNESS OF GOD. “I will instruct thee ? I will guide thee with mine eye.”—Ps. xxxii. 8. By gentleness, O God, Thou wouldst Thy children lead O'er perill'd ways, by martyrs trod, Or through life's verdant mead: Not the stern rod of discipline to wield Does Thy pure Grace, apart from sin, incline; But when reluctant hearts refuse to yield Some iron law instructs the spirit that is Thine. Yet were we like a child Loving, and pliant too, Thy perfect guidance pure as mild Would guard Life's opening view; E'en as a glance by some fond parent turn'd On her frail little one, who waits to see Those looks where young affection's lore is learn'd,— So would one gleam of grace attract our souls to Thee. Oh, for a watchful heart! A waiting mind of prayer, To view Thee, gracious as Thou art, “Our Father!” everywhere. Orphan'd in soul, nor friendless, should we seem, Did but the mind a sacred vigil keep; For ever would Thy guardian eye-glance beam,— Star of our troubled life, both when we smile, or weep! Unless we watch that “Eye,” Thy Will we cannot read; For, softer than a vernal sky It dawns on human need In gleam and glance, no prayerless hearts discern, And Love's unwatchful gaze may oft forego:— Only by looking upward, can we learn Wisdom divinely bland, to chasten weal and woe. Bend, pride of Reason! bend, Become a little child; And heaven to thee will condescend In wisdom undefiled; Oft where the haughty Scribes of learning fail God to discern in truth's unerring page, Infants of grace by simple love prevail, Wing'd by the Spirit's power to heights beyond their age. Then grant us, gracious Lord! In Thy blest page to see The faintest beam a heaven-bright word Imparts from truth, and Thee; Mild as the radiance of celestial love, So will each promise, threat, and precept dart Glances of truth,—as if God's eye above Were gazing through them, to inspire the heart. POETRY OF CLOUDS AND SKIES. “Number the clouds in wisdom.”—Job. xxxviii. 37. “God rideth in his excellency on the sky.”—Deut. xxxiii. 26. “The firmament showeth his handy-work.”—Ps. xix. 1. A speaking magic in poetic skies Affects the soul, and fascinates the eyes; Look where we may, some cloud-born grace we find To shade the mirror of responsive mind. And why did God thus beauteously array Calm noon, chaste eve, and re-commencing day, But that our echoing minds should inly feel How heaven and poetry to man appeal? Lord of the woods, and waves, and living air! All lead to Thee when purified by prayer; Connecting thus with beauty, colour, grace, The dying mercy which redeem'd our race. Let but Thy merit through creation shine, And what was common, now becomes divine; The beautiful on earth, the bright above, Are open sacraments which preach Thy love. How rich the consecrated dome of heaven, When to some priest at Nature's shrine is given The power, in all ethereal forms to see Symbols and signs of present Deity! The skies have meanings; and emotion seems Oft to array them with impassion'd gleams,— Colours intense, as if a conscious hue Blush'd o'er its birth, and brighten'd at our view. Painters and poets from the skies have brought Fancies and feelings, to inspire their thought: Beauty is there; and sentiment can rise To noble pathos in the naked skies. Home of the seasons! and the haunt of storms, Now fierce with gloom, now fair with opal forms, Dark in thy strength, or smiling in thy play, I love thy magic, and revere its sway. But most I hail thee, golden, calm, and deep, When isles of radiance on thy bosom sleep; Or robe-like clouds in rich confusion lie, As though veil'd angels floated up the sky Garb'd in the vesture of thy woven sheen, And left an outline where their veils had been:— So exquisitely touch'd the tinted air, Seraphic creatures might be mansion'd there. And who can tell, since first the heavens have spann'd Their arching glories over sea and land, What vast impressions from yon varied skies Have soothed man's spirit, while it charm'd his eyes? When to the captive, through his dungeon-bar Gleams of blue heaven come glancing from afar, Through fields of childhood Fancy seems to roam And wind the pathway freedom wound at home. And think how Sickness, when the pulse renews Its beat of vigour, hails yon skyey views, While with new gush of health each glance of love Seems to be answer'd, when it looks above. There memory, too, and meditation find Symbolic hues to mirror forth the mind; Sky and the soul like sympathies can meet, Till what our hearts express, the clouds repeat. And when, pure Lord of loneliness and woe! We dream Thy pilgrimage of pain below, Faith may conceive, full oft Thine harass'd eye Drank the deep quiet of congenial sky. And as ascending to Thy throne of light A cloud receiv'd Thee from the spell-bound sight Of those sad watchers, who beheld Thee soar Back to the bliss where Thou wert throned before, So when our hearts the sweep of heaven survey And solemn fancies o'er its surface play, Let not religion this true thought disdain,— A cloud shall waft Thee to our world again. TWILIGHT OF OUR BEING. “One day, known to the Lord, not day, nor night.”—Zech. xiv. 7. “Jesus said, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.”—John xiii. 7. “Though what I do ye know not now Hereafter sainted hearts shall see,” Saviour! before that will we bow And learn our cross by loving Thee: Grant to our souls the grace on God to live, And clasp the counsel which Thy precepts give. Such partial light and shade become The vexèd life our bosoms feel; For, could we clearly view the home Which yonder shrines in heaven conceal, How should we turn with loathing sense away From those stern duties, which demand each day! All light would make our hearts presume, All darkness end in black despair; But God has so arranged the gloom As best becomes the cross we bear:— An ampler vision might elate the mind, And deeper shadows would eclipse mankind. “We know in part,” and part of this How weakly can the wisest know! Our purest heavens of hallow'd bliss Are tinged with soiling earth below: Put into language, oft doth wisdom seem The broken semblance of a baseless dream. Such clouds and darkness round the path Of God to man encircled lie, That he who heavenly science hath This awful truth will scarce deny,— That earth seems moist with melancholy tears Dropt from the eyelids of some thousand Years. Yet sorrow is the penal bane Attemper'd to a world of sin; For where our God hath ceased to reign Darkness and death must enter in; And saintly eyes should learn to see by prayer Truths which transcend what mortal lips declare. THE BLESSED VIRGIN. “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.”—Luke i. 28. Ave Maria! blest o'er women all Who e'er on earth embodiment have found, Maiden and mother, both in thee we call With peerless favour by Jehovah crown'd. Ave Maria! virgin meek and mild, Unstain'd by passion's soul-polluting fires, Faith cannot view thee with thine awful Child, Nor thrill with more than sentiment inspires. Ave Maria! since thy sex began, Woman presents no type to rival thee; Nor can the feelings of a fallen man Echo thy thoughts of inward purity. Ave Maria! o'er the Babe Divine Bending with awe, maternally entranced, How must have throbb'd that vestal heart of thine, On Jesu's forehead when thy fond eyes glanced! Pure are the fountains of parental love Whose depths of bliss ineffable remain; Not the deep ravishment of lyres above Could e'er attune it with too sweet a strain: But thou, o'ershadow'd with The Spirit's power, By heaven's bright herald hail'd supremely blest, What hallowing mystery clothed that sacred hour When hung the Child-God on thy virgin breast! Boundless cternity and breathing time Blend in communion at thine awful bliss, And bid us wonder, in a trance sublime, That earth was hallow'd by a scene like this. The purest image saintly Thought can see Of maiden calm, with motherhood combined, Becomes too earth-born when compared with thee, Nursing The Babe whose Blood redeem'd mankind. Well may the poet's harp, and painter's hue, With all that Sculpture's marble-dreams express, Become ethcreal, when they bring to view Outlines which hint thy solemn loveliness. Yet can chaste minds, beyond all visual show, By thought create what reverence demands, Ave Maria! when our hearts o'erflow To see the God-Babe in thy vestal hands. Feeling and Faith, with poesy and prayer, Mingle their charms to make one beauteous spell, And what no melodies, nor hues declare, Our hush'd emotions unto Godhead tell. MARIOLATRY. “Jesus saith unto her, Woman! what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.”—John ii. 4. “I fell at his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou do it not! I am thy fellow-servant:—worship God.”—Rev. xix. 10. And yet, forbid it, reason, faith, and love, Both mortal powers, and Attributes divine, Ave Maria! that as Queen above, The worship due to God should ere be thine. Honour'd and holy, blest indeed wert thou,— To be the mother of His mortal frame Before Whose face the universe shall bow While rapt eternity resounds His name! The stain, that tempted Eve on woman brought, Ave Maria! is by thee reversed,— Mother of Him whose dying merit wrought A ransom for the race by Sin accursed. So to the Church's heart be ever dear, Anointed Virgin! 'mong all women blest; High o'er thy sex, we none like thee revere Within whose womb incarnate God could rest. But ah! we dare not, from the Lord of Lords Rob the due glory which to God pertains; Nor crown a creature with adoring words, And echo “Queen of Heaven!” with impious strains. Not sinless wert thou, in the sight of Him From whose dread gaze the blushing heavens retire, While round His Throne the o'erawed seraphim Prostrate their crowns, and cast their quiv'ring lyre. They tell us, how all deeps of tender grace Fresh in thy heart abide for evermore; And when the contrite seek thy pitying face, Those wells are open'd, and the faint restore; But, blest Redeemer! what is finite love Though most ideal in sublime excess, With that compared, which drew God from above To agonise for our dark guiltiness?— Less than a raindrop to the boundless sea, The vastest love created souls can feel When rank'd by His, who clothed Divinity With flesh, and suffer'd all that man could feel! Ave Maria! were thy vestal glow Of pity purer than blind error dreams, Yet unto Christ dost thou thy nature owe, And all thy goodness from His spirit streams. But when they dare this awful dream propound,— That e'en as mother o'er a son prevails, So at thy plea all grace and gifts abound And at thy prayer His goodness never fails! They say the sunbeam can enrich the sun From whose bright essence its fair beauty flows!— By such false creed from blinding fancy won, Which gives to Mary what to Christ she owes. Ye pious martyrs of a faith untrue, Who from the fount of God's unfathom'd heart Turn to broke cisterns, whence dark Ages drew Deluding errors that will not depart, Mercy and Grace in Christ embodied live; Straight from His love let each repenting Soul Draw the true pardon He alone can give, Nor dream that woman can a God control! That creed is sacrilege which dares deny The sympathies His bleeding Manhood learn'd, When Christ from glory came to weep and die, And back to heaven with human heart return'd. Away with doubt! men want no Virgin's plea, No angel, saint, nor martyr's prayer to bring, To gain the mercy which endures in Thee Thou of all grace the unexhausted Spring! Ave Maria! maid and mother blest, High above woman soar'd thy peerless lot; And with due rev'rence on thy name we rest, But shrink to credit what thy truth is not. And oh, in yonder beatific light Could thy deep calm be ruffled into care, As creature, thou might'st shudder at the sight Of sinners, prostrate at thy throne, in prayer! Ave Maria! this dread thought o'erpowers And awes the suppliant, who might worship thee,— That Jesus is thy Saviour too, and ours, The same in time, as in eternity. OUR TRUE CENTRE. “Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.” Isa. xliv. 22. “And ye shall find rest for your souls.” Jer. vi. 16. Our centre true is God alone, In whom man's aching breast Beneath the shadow of His Throne Can find a perfect rest; For less than God enjoy'd, would leave within us still A fev'rish want of soul, the Finite cannot fill. Yet ruin'd years must haply roll In anguish, gloom, or woe Along the worn and wearied soul, Before the heart can know What broken cisterns prove the hollow joys we love, While hearts forsake The Fount of living bliss above. This world is wound with fatal spells Attracting youthful Sense; And each gay scene some falsehood tells To mar life's innocence: Nothing but grace divine can disenchant the Earth And bid the soul aspire for what becomes its birth. A fascinating mist o'erveils Bewilder'd time, and space, When passion's demon power prevails, And lures a sensual race To dream polluted earth a paradise can be, And mould imagined heavens apart from Deity. The bloom of hope, the bliss of health, The bounding thoughts of joy, With all that springs from tyrant wealth, What myriads they decoy! Till glory, truth, and grace, and bliss by promise given, From souls recede away, and let this world seem heaven! But worst of all base spells that blind The conscience with deceit, Is that which makes our God mankind, And bows us at their feet, Awaiting till they crown by some awarded praise, The nothing Fashion gilds with her inglorious rays. Alas! for those who madly think Immortal Nature can From lips of transient homage drink What truly freshens man, While deep within the soul a thirsting sense abides For something nobler far than fame's uncertain tides. Since what is fame, but second-life In other spirits led? A feeling with this impulse rife,— That our creations spread Ideal worlds of thought, through which we love to roam, And find in kindled hearts a false, but fancied home? But thou, believer, think on this,— God is our only rest; And he who worships finite bliss Will live and die unblest: The infinitely good man's true proportion makes, And every gift but Christ the trusting heart forsakes. 'Tis true, the subject World is ours; But only when we wave Heaven's banner o'er its hostile powers, And for the Truth are brave; Thus panoplied by grace, and girt by secret prayer, We face embattled Fiends, and fight them everywhere. But never be this creed forgot, That men are exiles here; And they who seek a heavenly lot Must love a heav'nly sphere; And oft in soaring dreams of purity ascend To yon celestial Home, where saints and martyrs tend. The Spirit's love breathes now, or never, When souls for God are train'd Till mortal vice and evil sever From bosoms, where they reign'd: For by this truth intense all mighty Hearts must live,— Eternity will rue what time doth not forgive. Hail, vast Relief of souls who love, Lord of regenerate hearts! Faith can discern in Thee above A glory which imparts Far more than angel-life, to all who seek for rest And their hereafter lay, like John, upon Thy breast. As roll the waters to the wind A moment lifted high, So, swelling passion heaves the mind Upward to meet the sky; But when the storm declines and waters cease to roar, The folded waves lie down as level as the shore: So is it with delirious joy Where mad excitements reign, Or, blind emotions man decoy Some glitt'ring lie to gain; Raised and enrapt awhile, his heaven seems half begun, But when the dream resolves, unrest alone is won. MOTHER'S GRIEF. “Weeping for her children because they are not.”— Jer. xxxi. 15. The placid azure of thy pensive eyes Oh childless mother! like dejected skies, With such dim tearfulness is overspread, It softly tells thou dreamest of the dead. Bereaved thou art of that unfathom'd bliss, A first-born infant; and a pang like this Home to the centre hath thy spirit stirr'd, Too deep for sighs, too sacred for a word. Cold the wan beauty of thy sunken cheek; And tones of pathos, when I hear thee speak, Ring like a knell which haunts sad Memory's ear, And melts warm feeling into woman's tear. Alone I view thee o'er the Bible bend, Till solitude becomes thy sainted friend; While, rapt in stillness, oft the dreaming soul Wings its lone flight to where no earth-clouds roll. But wilt thou, mother, in this trance of gloom Hover and dream around thine infant's tomb? Dark Fancy! dars't thou lift the coffin-lid, And view in anguish what the grave hath hid? Those dawning gleams of consciousness and grace, The chisell'd beauty, and the cherub-face, How oft doth speculation these recall, And tell thee thy sweet babe possess'd them all! And when some cry of infancy is heard, Like sleeping water by wild music stirr'd, Thy heart-strings vibrate to each plaintive tone As if that weeper were indeed thine own. But, lady, there is balm and blessing left, And healing words for hearts like thine bereft; No childless orphan can the Church become, Though Christ hath vanished to His viewless home! Yet shall the Comforter on thee descend, And heaven-breathed solace with thy spirit blend; The Lord surrounds thee, when thou seest Him not, And God must change, ere grief can be forgot. Be Grace thy refuge: calmer thoughts will rise And rays from heaven illume thine inward eyes; Till in their brightness loss becomes a gain, While God is thank'd for this mysterious pain. And now, bethink thee, to thy babe in heaven How much of glory hath Redemption given! Worn by no race, at once it reach'd the goal, Sinless on earth, and now—a perfect Soul. Think, what a dignity to thee belongs Thus to have deepen'd the angelic songs, Thus to enrich with thy departed Gem The lustre of Emmanuel's diadem! And feel'st thou not, when God and glory seem To awe thy Spirit with a solemn dream, An Infant makes the skies familiar be, And helps to humanise the heavens for thee? Nor let harsh murmurs o'er thy doom arise As though God wrong'd the Saint His wisdom tries; Sorrow befits a world where Jesu bled, And dust was borrow'd to receive Him dead. In Christ, bereaved one! for profoundest grief Dwells the pure source of all divine relief; To minds which echo thee, most dear thou art, But oh! far dearer to thy Saviour's heart. That living Flow'ret which thy God hath given His love transplanted to a bower in heaven; There, shall each grace to perfect beauty rise, And bud with glory when it breathes the skies. DIVINE SECRETS. “Secret things belong unto God.”—Deut. xxix. 29. Above, below, mysterious all The moral facts our souls would scan; And when some pageant lifts the pall Which covers vast Creation's plan, A thinking Titan with his godless mind To shudd'ring Angels seems a monster blind. When David read man's glorious frame Ecstatic awe o'erpower'd his view; And, hymning forth Jehovah's name, He trembled into words, how true!— “How fearful am I, when by Love survey'd, Moulded by heaven, and wonderfully made.” Awake, what mysteries we enclose, And when we dream, more wondrous far! 'Tween life and death our limbs repose, And none can tell the truth we are; Time and eternity then blend and meet, As they will mingle at the judgment-seat. But when from earth to Heaven we turn, Pure faith is taught this truth to know,— Proud wisdom must itself unlearn By lisping childlike prayer below; Content in darkness to adore His ways With Whom 'tis glory to conceal their rays. All Eye, all Ear, all Presence, Power, In contact with creation's whole, Closing the eyelids of each little flower, Or bidding worlds around Thee roll,— Essential Deity, Thou dread Unknown, Angels would shudder to unveil Thy Throne! And yet, deep mystery proves the light From whence our reas'ning darkness gains A lustre, which restores the sight When blinded by some mental pains: God is a Fact, from whose unfathom'd All Eternity will not remove the pall. And as our God alone discerns Himself in Essence, truth, and will, So faith from revelation learns To bow before a mystery still; For God Incarnate is an awful shade Within whose depths the Church has mused, and pray'd. And what Thou doest, Lord, in life, Is dark indeed to those who roam Anguish'd, and worn by wasting strife, Creedless in heart, without a home;— Each grave that opens, and the friend who dies Some pang of mystery to the soul supplies. Why virtue droops, and Vice unveils A blushless front of gain and glee, Involves a problem which prevails O'er sceptic Minds, who cannot see That mortal life our education is, And builds up final woe, or future bliss. THE TWO BOOKS. “You here have an order for prayer, and for the reading of Holy Scripture, much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the old Fathers; nothing is ordained to be read but the very pure Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, or that which is agreeable to the same.”—Preface to the Book of Common Prayer. Two Books we have, all other books above, Which breathe the wonders of Incarnate love; Each to Jehovah points the living Way, And both inspire us to repent, and pray. Perfect as peerless, pure and most divine, Where God in language moves through every line, Where each calm word enrobes celestial Grace And man and Deity meet face to face, Is that Shechinah of almighty speech Where dwells The Spirit, time and souls to teach, Beneath whatever name 'tis known, or heard, Scripture, or Bible, or the Sacred Word. With this, comparison must be profane: Yet, laud we not in too heroic strain Britannia's liturgy, for matchless power To guide the conscience through its perill'd hour. Calm deep and solemn, chaste, and most sublime, Breathing eternity, yet full of time, Pure as seraphic lips in heaven desire, And fervid as the souls of saints on fire With rapture,—is the Litany we love: Sickness and sorrow both its blessing prove; And oft have mourners in the heart's despair Found a deep refuge for dejection, there. A healing softness, and a holy balm That book pervade, like inspiration's calm,— Subdued intensity and sacred rest, Which never fail the lonely and distrest. For, oh, we need not morbid passion's force, Nor hurried feeling, in its reinless course, Nor problems dark, for reasoning pride to scan; But what we need is,—mercy-tones for man. The sun-bright Angel, who adores and sings, Covers his brow with reverential wings; And perfect Saints, who most their God adore, Sink low in feeling, ere by faith they soar. The past breathes here the poetry of time, And thrills the present with a tone sublime, Till buried ages of the Church's youth Rise, and re-charm the world with ancient truth. Thou glorious masterpiece of olden Prayer! Deeper thy wisdom than cold words declare; Ever opposing some recurrent sin States act without, or Churches feel within. Not light men want, but love,—exceeding all An Age of idols dares devotion call; A childlike frame of purity and peace, Where Christ in conscience works divine release. And who the archives of thy past can see, Nor recognise the eye of God o'er thee, Presiding there with providential gaze To fit thy teaching for these fallen days? Creedless and proud, high-cultured, full of self, Greedy of gain, and worshippers of pelf,— Our wealth grows pagan as the world gets old, And none seem heroes, but the bad and bold! Then, bless we God for prayers where men are taught Low at the Truth to bow rebellious thought; Each lawless working of the will to chain, And yield to God the bosom's throne again. Repentance, bitter, stern, profound, and true, Obedient hearts, which yearn to dare and do, Whate'er the doctrines of the Cross command,— God send the Church, for this apostate land! Rather as servants, than as sons we bow Down at the shrine of awful Godhead now; Though heirs of grace, in Christ our own we claim,— How have we barter'd our baptismal name! Hence sad humility and fear become The sinful Race who leave their Father's home; Cries of dejection, more than chants of joy, Returning prodigals may best employ. Nor be forgot, that England's Prayer Book gives Pure, full, and plain, The Word by which she lives! Not dungeon'd in some dead and alien tone, But where the peasant-boy perceives his own. There, lisping Childhood, when it longs to learn Truths for which prophets bled, and martyrs burn, In such pure liturgy of grace may find All which can feed the heart, and form the mind. For common prayer, if catholic and true, Must not be tinged with individual hue, But be proportioned to the soul of Man, In deep accordance with redemption's plan. Lord of the Church! of sacrament and rite, In this may all adoring hearts delight,— “How apostolic is the root of all Our Church maternal would devotion call!” The heart of Ages still within them lives, Takes from the past, and to the present gives That hoary spell which hallows thought and word, And wakens feeling in its finest chord, Since, not from Rome, but ancient Gaul we bring The choral hymns our Altars chant and sing; And many a word devotion dwells upon, Hung on thy lips, thou loved and lone St. John! Source of the Church! true Paraclete for all, Long may such prayers on Christ for mercy call; No deeper grace can Thy pure wisdom give,— Than what our lips repeat, our hearts may live. BAPTISM. “The washing of regeneration.”—Tit. iii. 5. “Born of water and of the Spirit.”—John iii. 5. Thou little trembler, robed in white, Nursling of Heaven! sweet neophyte Before the font arriving, The birth-dawn of thy spirit-life With holy fulness be it rife, While hearts for thee are striving With God in prayer; that soon thy shielded charms May rest secure in Christ's baptismal arms. A silence breathed from God above, A halcyon of celestial love Now broods with blest control, Under the Throne of Him who came In form as weak as thy young frame,— Thrilling the inmost soul Of all, whose unfilm'd eye of faith perceives More than mere water on the forehead leaves. Bright students of the ways of God! Who, since Incarnate Mercy trod The forfeit earth of man, Bend your adoring eyes to learn Truths deeper than your thoughts discern, Shrined in redemption's plan,— Ye viewless Seraphim! this rite attend, And your calm watch with Christian worship blend. Thou innocent! with man compared, Thee hath eternal Truth declared A child of wrath and sin; But here, adopted, seal'd, and sign'd By Him who hath redeem'd mankind, For thee will now begin That second Birth renewing grace imparts Through this deep sacrament to infant hearts. Oh, if Emmanuel ne'er had said “Let children to Mine arms be led,” Parents might shrink aghast A creature into life to bring, Whose soul the curse of God might wring When time and earth are past!— But for the promise of baptismal grace, What sight so fearful as an infant's face? All that a birth of Flesh can give What is it,—but a doom to live, A heritage of woe, A destiny of guilt and death, A curse inhaled at every breath Life breathes from sin below? By grace uncharm'd, destruction seems to lower On the sad babe, ere Time can count an hour. But at the Font where Jesu stands With greeting heart and gracious hands, Ready to clasp the child, Pale infant! there, a breath from heaven May to thy dawning soul be given Through Him, the Saviour mild, Who, while He thunders from His regal Throne, Loves the sweet age on earth He call'd His Own. The Root of sacramental grace Is the new Adam of our race, The Man Divine who bled; Hence cometh our celestial birth, Beyond the parentage of earth, From our generic Head,— The Lord from heaven, whose vital Spirit gives All force by which the mystic Body lives. More than our first-born parents knew Before they proved to God untrue, Works that celestial gift; Angels, who on their trial stood, Exceed not this majestic good Which may thy soul uplift: A child of God!—can seraphim aspire To aught sublimer in their sinless choir? From thee the curse is roll'd away; Thy soul's new birth begins to-day; A cov'nant right to all Immunities and blessings high, The heart of Jesus can supply To those who heed His call: Now to the stillness of thy soul is given, Like breezeless water, to reflect a heaven. A City and a Crown are thine If thou be true to grace divine, Bearing thy destined Cross; Lo! on thy forehead lies the seal Where symbol both and sign reveal That Life must gain by loss: Firm to thy vow, beneath God's banner fight, And keep thy panoply of graces bright. Christ guard thee now, thou little one! His glory be thy shield and sun Whate'er thy lot may be; Incorp'rate with the Church thou art, To thee may life and love impart The truth which maketh free; New prospects ope, new principles and powers Rise into play, and rule thine unborn hours. And, if in secret darkness lie The seeds of heaven which none descry, Dormant and cold within, May God's reviving Breath awake, Till such dark bond of slumber break, And grace o'ermaster sin:— That latent germ baptismal life bestows Doth oft in elder hearts its buried power disclose. How water, word, and grace combine To work creative spells divine, In vain let Reason ask; Children are awful mysteries, Within whose depth no spirit sees But His,—who owns the task Of overcoming, through celestial birth, That born corruption, which is bred from earth. Hence! reas'ning sceptic, harsh and cold; For never will thine eyes behold Tokens which sense defy: Nature in secret works her plan, Her growth escapes the sight of man; Then, hush thy heartless cry,— As if the weakness of the water could Deprive the soul of sacramental good. True wisdom loves the word “obey,” And loving hearts but live to pray, Believing Christ as true; Safe in His arms, thou mother mild, With hope baptismal place thy child, And doubt not He will do A work mysterious for that infant soul,— Baptising nature with divine control. Henceforward, as a Priest and King, Thy babe becomes a sacred thing, An heir of grace and glory; Mother! to whom such charge is given, Now rear it for that throne in heaven Scripture unveils before thee; So discipline the dawning mind and will, That each some priesthood unto God may fill. “Our Father!” now thy babe may cry, Whose Elder Brother rules the sky,— The Man Divine, who came By bleeding Merit to atone For all the guilt sad Earth must own, And give the child a name, New as the sacramental Birth, which then Through water and by Spirit dawns in men. Blest Privilege! both deep and pure, Which might our trembling hearts assure That we are Christ's indeed: Our Robe baptismal,—keep it white, And never wilt thou lose the right Which marks the heavenly Seed Of all who, grafted into Christ by grace, Born in the Church, are God's adopted race. Oh, that on Man's expressive brow Baptismal pureness beaming now Maturer life might see!— How should we bless that rite of heaven Where grace is felt, and sin forgiven By mercy, full as free; And find God's Spirit ne'er that man forsook, Who kept in age, the vow his childhood took. But soil'd and stain'd by sin and crime, Corruption deepens with our time, And thus our hearts o'erlay That seed of Heaven, the Spirit granted When the new Birth was first implanted On our baptismal day: Yet not for this, let Souls profanely try From faith to hide what holy means supply. Rather, repent we! till the soul Shall yield to that sublime control Which heals the broken-hearted, Who in atoning Blood begin To bathe the soul, and wash their sin; Mourning they e'er departed From that blest Lord, whose interceding love Reigns on the glory-throne He rules above. CATECHISM. “Who gave you this name? My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism.”—The Catechism. If they who stand beside the source Of some famed river's mountain-flow, And ponder on its trackless course To meet the far-off waves below, Can feel a pensive influence born,— Then how, on each Sabbatic morn, The men of God must inly feel A musing depth of voiceless zeal, When at the fountain-head they stand Of youthful Life's untraced career, As round them groups an order'd band Of earnest children, shy and dear,— Encircled thus, to hear and speak, With glist'ning eye, and glowing cheek, Those Truths baptismal, pure and high, Which link our being with the sky. “Go, feed My Lambs,” The Saviour cried To Peter's large and loving heart; And ever have those words supplied What cannot from the Church depart,— A pastoral right to form and feed God's nurslings, by His grace decreed To taste the food of heaven, and live By all His word and wisdom give. What, though the catechiser teach Unfathom'd truths, which far outsoar All raptured saints and seraphs reach When most their minds a God adore, Love brings a light that truth explains Beyond what science ere attains, As Heaven by intuitions mild Gleams on the conscience of a child. If faltering tongues of bashful youth The careful Priest by welcome bland Attune to some almighty truth, Beyond a child to understand, Is not the most gigantic Soul Which awes the world by deep control, A mental babe with lisping mind, Compared with angels in its kind? The Gospel o'er the cradle bends, And gently leads each growing child, Nor at the Font its mission ends, But follows it with accent mild; And so, by her maternal voice The Church directs the infant choice, And loves to dream on each white brow The mystic Cross is mirror'd now. God shield each lamb, and little one! For soon the world before it lies; And cold were he who looked upon Those cherub lips, and chasten'd eyes, Nor felt his heart-pulse throb with prayer That all the Sponsors did declare, When first the white-robed babe was given To Jesu's arms for life and heaven, Hereafter each in faith may keep.— Alas, the infant-grace departs; Enough to make mild angels weep Already stains some youthful hearts! Wilder'd by many a temper wild Wilful and vain becomes the child, Till robes baptismal wear no more The whiteness at the Font they wore. Yet, Shepherd of Thy blood-priced fold! Since Thou didst stand at mother's knee, And as a spotless Babe behold The virgin brow, which bent o'er Thee,— Thy spirit hung on each high word An echoing conscience loved and heard, While patriarch, saint, and prophet brought Lessons to rear Thy human thought. Lover divine of children dear! In Whose fond arms an infant lay, E'en now the Church believes Thee near To hear their budding accents pray; And oh! if child-born mem'ries still Thy depths of sacred Manhood fill, Look from Thy Mercy-Throne on high, Hear children lisp, and mothers sigh. Nor let the stern and sceptic Mind 'Tween Christ and childhood take its stand, And, reas'ning here with falsehood blind, Presume to hold His secret Hand Who works by love's mysterious law A grace cold reason never saw; And by His Spirit, present now, Recalls the child's baptismal vow Back to the soul, perchance with fear;— And opes the spring of thought within, Until religion's vestal tear Is dropt o'er some remember'd sin: New hopes awake, and conscience burns With hallow'd blush, as more it learns, Who at the font His welcome gave, Still longs in heaven the child to save. Lord of simplicity and truth! A scene like this the oldest need, To summon back regretted youth And bid them with compunction bleed: A babe-like spirit, born of love,— What purer gift can Grace above Grant to the Saint, who lives below, More childlike for the heavens to grow? CONFIRMATION. “Do ye here, in the presence of God, and of this congregation, renew the solemn promise and vow that was made in your name at baptism, ratifying and confirming the same?”—Order of Confirmation. Lord of the blissful worlds above, Incarnate Light, celestial Love! Send from Thy prayer-moved mercy-seat The grace of grace, Thy Paraclete.— A touching sight for solemn tears, Like prophecies of future years, Under the aisles of hoary fane Is now enacted: Faith, and Prayer, O'er each young conscience come and reign, And, with The Spirit, bless them there! Round the rail'd altar humbly kneeling, On each bow'd form, o'erfraught with feeling, Anointed Hands will soon be laid; And righteous prayers be duly pray'd; Nor doubt we that a Gift divine Shall with the mitred priest's combine.— An ancient Rite, replete with glory, By meek apostles used and loved, Church of the Lord! is now before thee, By martyrs blest, and saints approved. But oh, ere yet that sealing grace God's death-pang won to bless our race, In answer to this prayer descend, “Arise, O Lord! this child defend, Daily increase that store divine Of love and light which make him Thine,”— Member of Christ! thou child of God! Thy central heart examine now; The narrow way if thou hast trod Enquire, and ratify thy vow. To you baptismal life was given By virtue of its Source in heaven; And vow'd ye were, for Christ and Cross To count the world as painted dross: The burden now 'tis yours to bear! And can ye unto Christ declare That awful vow your spirits bore, When ye, as helpless babes were brought, Baptised, and made for evermore God's own to be, in will and thought? Thou, of thy feeble Self afraid! Trembling with truth, a pensive maid, Through thy fringed lid the tearful gaze The secret of thy soul betrays; And through that veil of virgin white Soft tremors reach thy mother's sight. Pale candidate! though pure and young, Thy heart is trepid unto tears, And with a saintly horror wrung, Lest sin betray thine unborn years. “Your promise, can ye here renew?” That deep reply, “O Lord, we do!” Oh, is it not an awful word By God and list'ning Angels heard? Heaven echoes back the binding vow, And Fiends abash'd, before it bow; And writhe in darkness, thus to see A virgin heart which grace inspires, So consecrate to Deity Its faith, its feeling, and its fires. Yet, at the altar kneel in prayer; Tremble, but hope, for Christ is there! He will not fail this burden'd hour To strengthen thee with loving power; And when confirming hands are spread In faith upon thine awe-bow'd head, Thrill'd into speechless thought, whilst thou Wilt feel Eternity draw nigh, The heart of Him who hears thy vow In heaven responds to every sigh. He knows thee, loves thee, reads thy soul, Can circle thee with blest control; And in return for thy vow'd heart Himself by gift and grace impart. But, ah, mistake not; hectic zeal Is but the flush warm fancies feel: Of these beware, impassion'd Youth! Nor heed what thrill'd emotions say; They only love, who live the truth, And walk in peace the perfect way. Poetic thrills may soon depart, And barren oft, some burning heart; Emotions in themselves are nought Except to Christian action brought; Nor is one glorious promise given To souls which only sigh for heaven. High feelings to the sense appear A creed the world may beauteous call, But Christ hath made this doctrine clear,— One daily cross transcends them all! MARRIAGE. “An honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church.”— Form of Solemnization of Matrimony. Although the birthday of this God-made earth Seraphic harpers rose to sing, Whose choral ecstasies proclaim'd its worth And caused Heaven's crystal arch to ring, All was imperfect, till a Priest was there Creation's mouth to be, and mind, and prayer. Vain seem'd the splendour which no eye could see, The melody that none could hear; But when God utter'd, “Let Mine Image be,” Creation thrill'd, as Man drew near; And what was meaningless, and mute, and dead, Warm'd into life, and glow'd beneath his tread. As man for earth, so Woman was required The crowning grace of man to form; Alone, not even Adam was inspired To feel creation's godlike charm: And thus, faith hears this fiat from The Throne, “It is not good for man to be alone.” So ere the fall, a Priest almighty brought A bridal Eve to Adam's heart; A living Echo to the love he sought, A help-meet never to depart, A true companion for the soul to be, Fresh from her God, in faultless purity. Marriage is holy. May no heathen-fire Around the Christian altar flame; Impassion'd souls let saintliness inspire And hallow hymeneal claim: Belials in sense are minds by flesh o'erruled, And love is vice, unless by virtue school'd. How hush'd and holy is yon bridal scene Before God's altar!—view'd by one Who e'er in faith to Cana's home hath been, That marriage-group to gaze upon, Where the pale water blush'd itself to wine, Moved by a miracle of grace divine. Stainless in vesture, as the lilies white, With flower-buds in her wreathèd hair, Fearful and trepid, with o'erawed delight Lo, the young bride is kneeling there, Her dropping lids in mild dejection bent, And young heart with a holy conflict rent. In that pure breast what garner'd feelings play Like pulses with mysterious beat! To think sweet Girlhood now hath wing'd away And Love must quit a calm retreat, Sacred to thought, by friends and forms no more, And truths, which made the reeling heart run o'er! It is not, that a voiceless dread awakes Suspicion, lest her choice be wrong; No blighting vision o'er the future breaks To which both guilt and grave belong: Yet, sadness looms around her like a spell, As oft in marriage-chime there seems a knell! Our life is mystery; and the brightest joy That flushes round a feeling heart, Seems coldly shaded by some dim alloy Doom'd never from man's world to part: True mirth with mournfulness is oft allied, As living babes suggest the babes who died. And she, yon bridal Star of beauty now, Oh, marvel not, as there she kneels, That ere the wife can dawn upon her brow Back to bright girlhood fancy steals; Dead joys revive in tombs to fancy dear, Melt through the heart, and mingle with a tear. Last eve, at halcyon twilight's dreamful hour When none but God the soul could see, She pray'd and ponder'd in her girlish bower, And sigh'd, young Past! her thoughts o'er thee; Flower, fruit, and pathways, all instinct with truth, Seem'd to accost her like the spells of youth. She mused on what her spousal Life might fold Within its undevelop'd scene; On wings of love recall'd the times of old, And wept o'er all bright hearts had been; And scarce perceived the pensive moonlight throw Its calm cold lustre on the lake below. But, maiden! ere thy sacred ring be worn, Beyond a mother's purest gift The Church hath up to Heaven's high portals borne A prayer, which shall thy soul uplift To heights of bliss, serene as brides attain, Whose wedded hearts are thrones where Christ will reign. Souls are espoused by every hallow'd claim, If wedlock far diviner prove Than mere clay-throbs, which boast the common name Of what Flesh means by mortal “love:”— Christ and the Church are shadow'd out by this, And cast heaven's radiance round an earthly bliss. VISITATION OF THE SICK. “Bear our heavenly Father's correction; there should be no greater comfort to Christian persons, than to be made like unto Christ, by suffering patiently adversities, troubles, and sicknesses.”—Order for Visitation of the Sick. Sermons in sickness heaven can preach, When pangs and penalties may teach What custom rarely sees,— That health is mercy next to grace, And should inspire a sinful race The God of health to please. Strange! if our hearts be so accursed That nothing, save a gift reversed, Can make men prize their good: Blessings look dim which seem to stay, But brighten, when they wing away From souls who Christ withstood. So is it with the fields of youth, The shrines of tenderness and truth And all fresh Boyhood proved,— When we survey the scene no more, Or dream to life the dead of yore Whom once we fondly loved, Oft does the inward blush arise To think, how calmly we could prize Redundant mercies, then! We marvel, why our love was cold, And boyishly our past behold Now we are wither'd men! Parental bowers of peace and home, And lanes our truant steps did roam, Make landscapes in our soul; While votive tear-drops Truth can shed O'er imaged graves, where sleep the Dead Whose eyes our hearts control. Thus longs atoning love in vain The past should o'er the present reign, That what was once, might be; But youth, and all young hours possess'd, In thine abysmal darkness rest Thou pall'd eternity! And thus, in sickness when we lie With languid pulse, and fever'd eye, Pining, and pale, and lone; While throes of secret anguish burn,— Love through each throb would have us learn The truths we ought to own. Remember'd blessings round us throng We valued not, when health bloom'd strong, Which challenge holy tears; And if chance-gleams of skyey blue Some half-unblinded window through Confront our pallid fears,— How does the distant landscape seem Apparell'd by poetic dream! Till fancy yearns for fields, Brooklet and forest, bank and wood, And each green shrine where solitude Religious silence yields. But what transcends the all of this,— On the sad couch of pain we miss Christ's hallow'd courts of grace; Where Litanies divinely call From blending souls, which prostrate fall, For God's uplifted Face. Not seldom hath the sainted chime Of sabbath-bells become sublime, Yet mild, and melancholy, When pensive Languor, far away Has heard their ebbing dream-tones play, In sickness, sad and lowly. Like Zion's harping saint it cries “To thee, oh Lord! my spirit flies, And fain before the Shrine My kneeling heart wonld humbly pour The chanted praise I hymn'd before, In courts of grace divine.” But, sacred Mother, bring release; Come, lift the latch, and with soft “Peace!” Enter the sick man's room; O'er that pale brow Thy cross did seal Shed the soft dews of balm that heal, And light each haunted gloom. Far better thus with Thee to hie And hear a saintly mourner sigh, Than run where feastings reign; Wisdom, beyond the schools to reach, Thy heaven-breathed words of solace preach To Hearts subdued by pain. Counsels divine, in tone serene, Varied with grave rebukes between, Thine Office now imparts; And there beside yon dying bed The Body and the Blood are spread, Which feed our famish'd hearts. Lord Jesus! Thou art present there Entempled in each awful prayer; The room our altar is; Angel and saint we realise, And vision with prophetic eyes Scenes of seraphic bliss. Go, man of pleasure, sensual Thing! Whose life-boast is to laugh and sing; Be ours the chamber lone Where prayer and musing sickness meet, And find before the Mercy-Seat, What health has never known. Here may authentic priests, O Lord, Thy grace dispense, and soothing word, Like almoners for heaven; And teach oblivious hearts a lore Thy peerless martyrs taught of yore, When conscience heard, “forgiven.” If health have joy, the sick partake This boon divine,—for Thy dear sake To suffer, not complain; And, ere the sun of life go down, Beyond their cross to see the crown Of kings, with thee who reign. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. (VILLAGE FUNERAL.) “Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Order for the Burial of the Dead. The bells are tolling with a dreamy chime Which melts and mingles with the air around, Mourning for her who died in vernal prime, Queen of the village by her virtues crown'd. Last week she bounded, full of girlish life, Fleet o'er the turf, elastic as the breeze, Radiant as morn, with bloom and beauty rife, Fresh as the wave which gambols on the seas; But Christ recall'd her for His home on high To harp in glory God's Incarnate love, Ere guilt had waken'd one remorseful sigh, Or earth untuned her for a heaven above. Oh! gently lay her where the yew-trees wave Their verdant darkness o'er some grassy tomb, Where sunbeams learn the language of the grave, Tinging their brightness with a temper'd gloom. There shall the daisy rear its infant head, And fairy wild-flowers drink the dew of spring, While o'er the turf that greenly wraps the dead, Autumnal Winds their plaintive descant sing. 'Tis the same spot her rosy girlhood sought Where fresh from school, with bright companions gay, In maiden fancy, free from troubling thought, She work'd her sampler, or retired to play.— Dear is the quiet village church to me, Saxon, and simple, touch'd with tender glooms; Lifting its widow'd form so gracefully As though 'twere conscious of encircling tombs. Whatever shade expressive clouds can throw, Or hills wood-crested may around it cast, I love to view it in the vale below Connect the present with our storied past. Oft have I paused, when lull'd by pensive bliss, To hear the curfew mellow'd on the wind, Waft the farewell of Day to scene like this, Soft to the ear, as soothing to the mind. But far excelling all chaste morn bestows, The hush of twilight, or the harvest-moon, Or what mere landscape to the minstrel shows When silent thoughts their sanctity attune Is felt,—when village-funeral winds its train Slowly and sadly to some churchyard-gate, And our deep Service tones its heaven-born strain, To scatter darkness from bereavement's fate. Hark! from the woodland floats the forward breeze A low sweet dirge, yon village-maidens sing, Whose white robes glisten through the waving trees As on the dead to her last home they bring. Nay, sob not, mother! for thy beauteous child, Though like a tendril from thy heart it grew; Eternity she felt, ere Time defiled, Or made her soul untender and untrue. And thou, hoar'd grandsire! with thy grief-worn face, Oft did the prattler on thy knee recline, And hold up features Fancy loved to trace, Which matrons told thee, in thy youth, were thine; I see thee now, with tott'ring step advance, Wan are thy cheeks, and drops of aged woe Bedew thy visage, and bedim thy glance As onward to the grave the mourners go. But One is present, whom no eye can see, Except by faith, and that is Christ the Lord! And “Weep not,” childless mother, comes to thee, If thy heart open to His gracious word. Thou blessed Ritual! throbs of Jesu's heart Still in thy tones of thrilling mercy live; When yawns the tomb, most wonderful thou art, By echoing all God's inspirations give. The “Resurrection and the Life” is near, By Spirit present, and in love as deep As when He touch'd the young man's open bier, And gently bid wild Anguish not to “weep.” As o'er that grave the “dust to dust” awakes A dismal echo in the bleeding soul, How the damp earth-clod on the coffin breaks, Till the deep tides of inward anguish roll! Yet o'er the tomb heaven's canopy unfolds, And hark! these words of soothing magic sound, While Grief looks upward, and by faith beholds The Lord of life and resurrection crown'd,— “Blest are the dead, who in the Lord depart: Yea, saith the Spirit, for their pangs are o'er; Serene as heaven Christ keeps the sainted Heart, Whose works are ended, and who weeps no more.” CHURCHING OF WOMEN. “We give thee humble thanks, for that thou hast vouchsafed to deliver this woman thy servant, from the great pain and peril of childbirth.”— English Prayer Book. In mother's love there hides a spell Maternal hearts alone can see; Transcending all that tears may tell, Or man could be. Far down within the spirit's deep Her fountains of affection lie, Like currents which in darkness sweep, Nor face the sky. Tender abyss of peerless love! To heaven's omniscient eye-glance known, The Woman-born, Who reigns above, Thy claims doth own. A pillow'd Babe on mother's breast, Beneath Him throbb'd the Virgin's heart, And, Woman! thou on Him canst rest, Whoe'er thou art. Oh! magic force of nature, felt Far as the sun and sea extend; Beneath whose law all beings melt, All spirits bend. The Indian mother, stern and strong, Cradles her infant on the tree, And wildly chants her loud wood-song For lullaby. And the stern negress, seeking food, Fastens the babe upon her back, To roam each rocky solitude Or lion's track. Nor scene, nor change, nor earth nor sky Enfeeble Love's maternal force; Distance and time before it die, Whate'er their course. A passion this, so pure, so deep, That while bereavèd fathers moan, Oft wordless mothers only weep In heart alone. But why did God such love create Unquenchably supreme, and pure?— Because from mothers Spirits date Their curse, or cure. Thus saints and martyrs, heroes, all Whom wond'ring Time delights to praise, In heaven itself may still recall Their infant-days, When learn'd they from maternal lips Lessons of holy love and prayer, No clouds hereafter could eclipse, Nor soul's despair. Then, pallid mother! draw thee nigh, Perill'd by pangs, but saved in birth; And gently lift thy downcast eye, To heaven from earth. The virgin whiteness of that veil Becomes thine inward purity, And hides upon thy forehead pale What angels see Of blissful worship,—deep and mild, Which mothers for their first-born pay, And Love, with conscience undefiled, Offers to-day. Thou art the parent of a Soul, The mother of a deathless Mind! And Christ to thee imparts control For this design'd. Self-discipline, and prayer-born love, And persevering wisdom calm Breathe, Holy Spirit! from above With soothing balm; That from Thine altar she may part In saintly mood, screne and high, And worship Christ with yearning heart, Until she die. Mothers are more than mines of wealth If God-devoted Souls they be; And what makes Empires' moral health And purity They guard, For, when do Nations sink Into dark graves of sin and woe?— When Church and State no longer think What debt they owe To christian mothers; unto whom Both God and nature have consign'd Existence, from whose dawning bloom They nurse mankind. COMMINATION. “Is much to be wished ? to the intent that being admonished of the great indignation of God against sinners, ye may the rather be moved to earnest and true repentance.”—Prayer Book. As Time grows old, the earth from heaven recedes More distant far; No Conscience bleeds To feel the burnings of that inward scar, Which so discolours o'er with sin Th' apostate soul we bear within. A period was, when God and angels came So near to thought, The Church's name With the fine strength of holiness was fraught; Her frown east midnight where it fell,— Her blessing wove a guardian spell. But now, we boast an intellectual blaze That scatters all, Cold Reason says Before the majesty of Mind should fall! Dazzled with light, but dark in love, Sin loathes the truth which looks above. Sensual and proud, a Belial age is ours Drunken with pride, And grasping powers By which the godless will is gratified; Greedy of gold, athirst for pelf, And seeking heaven in worshipp'd Self. Thou fond admirer of a holy time When earth touch'd heaven! And thrills sublime Were to heroic saints and martyrs given Of something purer than blind Sense Can to a coarse rude age dispense,— Marvel no more that Discipline lies dead; Self-will reigns now; Laurels, not ashes, crown the creedless head And wreathe man's brow: For sackcloth, singing-robes are worn, And none but saints now seem forlorn! When God was fear'd, due fasting calm'd the blood; With naked feet Then Penance stood Low at the porch, the pastoral Band to meet, Sackclothed by shame, with downcast eyes, Sprinkled with ashes, heaving sighs: Severely gracious, thus the Church's rod Wielded o'er sin The claim of God, And o'erawed penitents, to weep within, Driving them forth with scalding tears To feel the pangs of righteous fears. So with mount Ebal's menace Zion's song Was well combined; And true as strong The healing power with which it calm'd the mind: Indulgence then was not in vogue, Nor framed its pleasing decalogue! But with Her holiness, the power departs A Church can wield O'er chasten'd hearts, Led by subduing love themselves to yield To mild Correction's lawful charm, Which keeps the soul from sinful harm. Too oft our “church” is self-election now— Our creed the will; And few avow That Christ is throned in christian temples still, A Presence and a Glory there Receiving praise, and hearing prayer. Awake! awake! thou Arm of God, awake! Put on thy strength, Thy fear forsake Church of our fathers! be Thyself at length; Bride of The Lord, a Mother kind, Watchful, but not to error blind. Spirit divine! in this her trial-hour Of sinful dread, Inbreathe a power That shall to glorious Duty lift her head Whose panoply is ardent prayer Which more and more each gift should bear. And we, as children of our Mother dear, In evil days Oh, let us fear; And in our lentine gloom on Ebal gaze, And as the tenfold curses roll, Let each, O God! subdue the soul: For, art Thou not a sin-consuming Fire, Awful as pure In Thy dread ire? Never may sense our godless mind allure, To think that hell alone can burn In fictions, which dark fancies learn. Mercy, Lord Christ! most infinite Thou art: But judgment true Will cleave each Heart That will not dread Thee in some darker hue, Before Whom prostrate worlds must fall, And worship Him who sways them all. So, when the priestly Comminations roll In thunders deep, Till each awed Soul In the hush'd centre of pale conscience weep, Our sackcloth let repentance be, Remorse—the ashes God can see. So will lost Penance in such hour revive; Sorrow for sin In prayer will strive; Till, wash'd and whiten'd by the Lamb within, The heart-renew'd God's Word descries Piercing, and pure as angel-eyes. Back to the world, in penitence and prayer Then may we speed: If wounded there,— Then look we upward, while our spirits bleed; For, on The Throne there beats a Heart In all true grief that takes its part. PRAYERS AT SEA. “Glorious Lord God! at whose command the winds blow and lift up the waves of the sea, and who stillest the rage thereof.”—English Prayer Book. Fond mother, with thy wakeful ear, Hark, how the storm-blasts through the welkin roll! Thunder alarms the breast of guilty Fear, And arrowy lightnings glance from pole to pole. Louder and louder sweeps the gale! Fierce, full, and large, the hissing rain-drops fall; And midnight Terror, with emotion pale, Begins in secret on her God to call. Calm as a flower yon nursling lies, Rock'd into silence on thy cradling breast; Yet doth thy bosom heave with unheard sighs Which move the spirit into sad unrest. But not for thy domestic bower, Or those who sleep within its guardian-shade, Art thou awake at this convulsive hour To hear the crash wild Elements have made. Yet rides thy heart the rolling deep, Toss'd on huge billows in tumultuous swell, And voiceless tremors through thy bosom creep For thy lone sea-boy, loved at home so well! But lately, on thy breast he lay His head in fondness, parting for the sea, And would not brush the manly tear away Which flow'd from boyhood, and which fell on thee. And now, amid the shrouds aloft, Perchance he grapples with the creaking mast; Yet can Remembrance hear a blessing soft, And feel thine arms maternal round him cast. Mother! The Church confronts the waves; Her litanies can lull their angry roar; And He who watcheth o'er the ocean-graves Can make the sea as tranquil as the shore. Christ on the waters, forms a Home For all who trust Him in the tempest wild, Far as the pilgrims of the deep can roam, Or billows lullaby a sea-born child. Safe is thy darling in this hour, Dearer to Heaven, than mother's heart can know; Calmly entrust him to that sleepless Power, Deepen thy prayers, but let not doubts o'erflow. Mirthful and bright, thy sea-boy ran Around thee once, though garden, grove, and field; But now, emerging into ripen'd man, Conscience and creed their sainted influence wield. Precious, yon Bible!—'twas thy boon; And, mother, where thy parting tear-gush fell, Oft on the deck, beneath the sacred moon He reads the warnings thou hast scored so well. And that high book of hallow'd Prayer A treasured sister gave, with farewell-kiss, Oft will he clasp it on the ocean there, And hail the sabbath as a holy bliss. God of the winds, and waves, and seas! Whom all the vassal Elements obey, Whether by palmy shores the placid breeze Soft as a seraph-wing, descends to play, Or tempests heave the mountain-surge, Flashing with foam beneath some lurid glare While the drench'd mariners the vessel urge, We thank Thee for our oceanic prayer! Or, when the booming death-guns pour Peal after peal, redoubling as they roll, Or Victory shouts her patriotic roar Of loud huzzahs from seaman's gallant soul, Lord of the Deep! by Thee inspired, Our Church for each some high-breathed prayer imparts; That they whom Valour hath for conquest fired, Should have the Prince of Peace to hush their hearts. Seldom can inland-worship prove Toned with such tenderness, divine as deep, Like God's own halcyon calming from above The wailing Hearts which o'er some lost one weep, As when beneath the trancèd air While moonbeams like a shroud enrobe the wave, Soft fall the tones of that funereal Prayer When parts the billow for a seaman's grave. Tearful the watching comrades stand, For round a dead One how intense the spell!— Brushing large tear-drops with a rough-worn hand, They look, but cannot speak, the word, “farewell.” Peace to the Dead! he waits his hour When the last trumpet shall untomb yon sea, And with such life-blast all the waves o'erpower, That risen dust shall soar to Deity. GUNPOWDER TREASON. “We adore the wisdom and justice of thy Providence, who so timely interposed in our extreme danger, and disappointed all the designs of our enemies.” Prayer Book. Two Wills alone may cause our world to move, Finite below, or Infinite above; And all which reason and religion say Points to the question,—“which should lead the way?” Science the first, but Faith her God will call Alpha of each, and Omega of all. God is in history! an almighty Soul, A secret Energy, divine Control, Will of all wills, yet leaving manhood free, Binding our time with His eternity: No chance can reign, till His dread promise dies, And orphan'd Earth for vanish'd mercy cries. God rules in history! read by this deep plan Gone ages harmonise their truths for Man; While he, unconscious of those secret laws Which link the second with a Primal Cause, Obeys each bias, acts his perfect will, And yet leaves God supreme in purpose still. So grant us, Lord, a providence to trace Directing all things for Thy chosen race; Kingdoms and kings, the palace and the cot, Insect, or seraph,—none can be forgot; For in the hollow of Thy hand repose Atoms, and worlds; o'er each Thy goodness flows. And well, on this day, doth our Church decree Anthems of love, which heave our hearts to Thee, Celestial Watcher! Whose soul-reading eye Did from yon heavens the miscreant-plot descry, And, by that wisdom saints exult to own, Forewarn'd the Empire, and preserved a throne. Ripe was the plan; each purpose deeply laid, And Treason gloated o'er a Church betray'd; A helpless Victim, soon to be destroy'd Look'd Freedom then, to faction overjoy'd; Sworn was the oath, the sacrament was taken,— But England was not by her God forsaken! Praise to the Lord! let choral harpers sound; Praise to the Lord! yet saints repeat around, The Angel of Whose presence then was nigh And bared foul Treason to the open sky, Blasted her guile, and by protective charms Shielded our Throne, and saved the Church from harms. And mix'd with praise, let some remorseful prayer The darksome burden of our guilt declare; For what but mercies can outnumber sin?— Whiten our hearts, atoning Blood! within; Till, hallow'd by celestial truth, we raise That living hymn where Life becomes a praise. THE MARTYR-KING. “Blessed Lord, we magnify thy name for thine abundant grace, bestowed upon our martyred Sovereign.”—Service for King Charles the Martyr. Oh, burning plague-spot on the brow of Time, The withering curse of regicidal crime!— Mock'd and betray'd by treason-bands And massacred by murd'rous hands, On this day soar'd to endless fame Ascending in Emmanuel's name True to his creed, above man's impious charter, Charles the revered,—the Church's royal martyr! Who has not read, till heart and brain were fired With holy wrath against Self-will inspired, When Loyalty, inert and cold, Parley'd before the bad and bold; When faction, treason, falsehood, all In one combined on heaven to call, Baptised religion into Murder's cause, And sanction'd regicide with sacred laws! Alas! for country, church, and crown, and creed, When martyr'd Principle must burn and bleed; Or else, a regal Conscience die Into a mean and miscreant lie, Forswearing all the truths that shine With radiance drawn from truths Divine, Because Democracy would dare to sing Her psalm of blood o'er England's sainted king! Oh! Thou, from Whom both king and kingdom draw Their source, their wisdom, and undying law, Now let our Church's sighs and tears Soften the Empire into hallow'd fears; For on her rests the curse of crime, A sacrilege which burden'd time And tinged our soil with that horrific stain,— The blood of Monarchs, when by God they reign! Who sign'd his warrant with an impious glee Proved how satanic blinded souls can be: As christian, monarch, husband, friend, Can time to us a nobler send? His failings rose from junctures bad Which might have turn'd an angel mad: Passion ran high; and lust for lawless power Raged like a fiend in that chaotic hour. Ruler Divine! Whom heaven-born souls obey, At least Thy Church on this remorseful day That murder'd Prince may well recall, Who prized her glories more than all; For whom his royal spirit strove With anguish of exceeding love: True to her martyr-king, this day be kept, And weep for him, who oft for Her had wept. Nor be forgot, that Crimes historic teach Warnings profound which may the wisest reach. Dead Sins are living preachers now; And weeping hearts of prayer avow That, God! except Thy grace prevent, Men still are on some madness bent: Wisdom they want, and meekness more, to own The sceptred lordship of Thy boundless Throne. RESTORATION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY. “The Great Rebellion, and all the miseries and oppressions consequent thereupon.”—Prayer Book. Friend of the friendless! Thou art there When throbs a soul with silent prayer In hours of sadness holy; And viewless Angels hover nigh With placid brow and pensive eye, To watch our melancholy. “Stand still! and your salvation see,”— Duty and blessing both from Thee, Lord, here may faith discern; Submission is that saving power Which glorifies Earth's darkest hour, Could Love the secret learn. The Cup that Jesus bow'd to drink, Though feeling start, and flesh may shrink, Disciple! thou must drain; A suff'ring Head each member thrills; We conquer, by enduring ills, And bleed before we reign! Thus, when dead Ages we untomb And wander down their peopled gloom Beholding what hath been,— A patient mind and quiet heart Have ever filled the Hero's part In history's troubled scene. Submission, passive, deep, and pure, Alone has proved a matchless cure For all the Church has borne; Her watchword was, “Stand still! and see The unbared arm of Deity, Since thou art unforlorn.” Thus when apostate Creeds began To blight the erring mind of man, How meekly bore his wrong That five-times banish'd Saint, who kept The truth unstain'd, while ruin swept In Arian blasts along. Still breathes a theocratic air In church and creed, if God be there, As Faith will ne'er deny; Unweapon'd, save by inward grace, Believers move with martyr-pace Beneath the fiercest sky. The worst of kings seems nobler far Than mad Rebellion's impious war, In havoc, blood, and fire; The sin of witchcraft,—brand it well, Its birth-seed is the pride of hell, By which dark Fiends aspire! A Nemesis for injured kings Or soon, or late, atonement brings,— Dead Empires this declare; Some thunder-blast of whelming wrath Will burst upon that Nation's path, Who robs a kingdom's heirs. And ever, as this day returns Oh, Saviour-god! our spirit learns Where safety true resides; That not our merit, but Thine arm, Not foresight, but Thy prescient charm Our refuge still provides. In orphanhood the Church may roam, And crownless monarchs need a home To exiled anguish lent; Base faction with Iscariot-breath May shout for dungeon, rack and death,— But Faith can be content. Content to watch, and weep, and wait, And bear the ban of iron Fate With uncomplaining heart; Her patience is a holy strength Subduing crime with prayer at length, Which Christ and Grace impart. Sun of the Church! Thou Saviour bright, A glory gilds the darkest night Affliction can endure, When Thy pure Spirit sheds a ray On saints who keep the narrow way, Like angel-paths secure. THE ACCESSION. “Our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria as on this day set over us by thy grace and providence, to be our Queen.”—Prayer Book. This world is like that Creature vast The royal dreamer had to face; Whose head from burnish'd gold was cast, But when you reach'd the talon'd base Vile metal there commenced its lower sway, And slowly crumbled into worthless clay. And who like monarchs this can know, At whose accession all things wear The richness of a regal glow, And triumphs of that festive glare A coronation and a crown present, With all the pomps of shouting Welcome blent? The spangles on the mourning-dress Worn for some princely head, which lies Cold in sepulchral nothingness, Are scarce removed from courtly eyes,— Ere happy mourners to another king Their venal chant of vaunted homage sing. Alas! for Kings, if state and throne, If splendour and monarchal pride Were all that royal minds could own, Or crowns and fawning courts provide: A fate like this the soul would overpower, And harrow princes in their calmest hour. The kingdom of the mind exceeds Whatever realms and rank impart, And oft a monarch inly bleeds To find himself a friendless Heart,— In crowded loneliness to speak and smile, And be unechoed in his thoughts the while. And hollow dreams must oft surround The pageantries of royal state; Deceits and dangers there abound While secret anguish gnaws the great: Peasants can weep, but Princes dare not show The aching centre of their voiceless woe! Flatter'd by many, loved by few, Before them group and gather all Who seek to veil each covert-view, Their serpent tongues the “country” call; Too oft fair loyalty is glozing speech Gilding the cause cold Self desires to reach. Hence, Thou for whom a realm is kept O'er which the sunbeams ne'er go down, Wider than that the eagles swept, When Rome became a huge renown,— The Church anoints thee with her unction now, And drops the crown upon Thy jewell'd brow. While thrones descend, and empires shake 'Mid loud convulsion fierce and far, And strife and civil discord make Pale Europe rock with coming war, God of our glories! 'tis in Thee we own The deep foundations of a christian throne. Lift we our heart-breathed hymn on high To That incarnate King of kings! Under Whose providential eye A coronation-anthem sings Each patriot soul, who Church and Crown can see Reposing grandly, when they rest on Thee. The life-blood of a loyal heart Flows bravely through our British veins; Nor shall this hero-truth depart From cot and palace, shore and plains,— That Kings on earth a regal shadow throw Of Him, to Whom all worlds subjection owe. ORDINATION. “The congregation shall be desired, secretly in their prayers, to make their humble supplications to God.”—Rubric for the Ordering of Priests. Saviour of spirits! if the burden'd life Our ransom'd being into action bears, Be ever with some wordless mystery rife Which mocks what Adoration's lip declares, Oh, is it not, when Truth's devoted hour To Thine Own altar some young Levite leads, And the high gift of Thine absolving power Endows the Priesthood for celestial needs? Yes, long as awed remembrance can remain Shall I that everlasting moment feel, When in the silence of St. Asaph-fane Heart, soul, and conscience did these words o'ersteal, “Receive Thou, for Thy priestly work divine, A promised unction from the Holy One; Anointed be thou at this hallow'd shrine, Watchman of Zion! lo, thy work begun! “Absolve for Christ the sin pure grace forgives, For Him reserve what He himself retains; Dispense the Food by which the spirit lives, The ruling Sacrament wherein He reigns.” And when a stillness, thrilling, rapt, profound, Breathed from the depths of each adoring Soul, Eternity seem'd closing all around And shaded conscience with divine control. With seven-fold gifts a Grace did here descend Hearts to illumine with celestial Love, And to each priest below some unction send Perfumed with incense from The Priest above. Let Faith believe, and ever hope and pray Lord of the Temple! Thou wert nigh, to bless Each Shepherd, vow'd to feed thy flock that day, And fold them safe in life's vast wilderness. To guard, premonish, and with truth provide The Saviour's Body here on earth which roams; Pure unto death, to preach The Crucified, And beckon pilgrims to their sainted homes,— Such was the Charge we messengers received, Such the high call our stewardship obey'd; Woe be to us! if truths were unbelieved, Our bosom prayerless and the Church betray'd. Thus, living Shepherd of immortal Sheep! If to our pastoral work the soul was given, Though for sad errors all must wail and weep, Still, let us hope there breathed a gift from Heaven. Years since have roll'd, of trial, change and grief, But still that Ordination-vow is heard; And what can soothe us with sublime relief, “But, “I am with you!” oh, Incarnate Word? And, blent with awfulness of faith and fear, For each young watchman then for Christ ordain'd Prophetic Fancy sketch'd some quiet sphere, Where souls for Jesu might be sought, and gain'd. Visions, perchance, of rural cots retired Hover'd around the priested hearts of those Who, ne'er by sad ambition inly fired, Haunt the lone hamlet where the poor repose. Such was the scene our peerless Herbert loved, Pictured in quaint and quiet Walton's lines; Which Hooker sought, and Hammond's taste approved, In whom the image of a Pastor shines. Yet, little boots it, what our destined place In the large vineyard of the Lord may be, Weave but the spells of Thine ordaining grace, And Time and Scene are lost, O Lord! in Thee. Whether in haunts of fever, homes of gloom Where squalid Woe retreats, and yearns to die, The toil-worn pastor cheers some tatter'd room, And calms the anguish of a mourner's sigh; Or, haply down where greenwood-dales retire Through hawthorn-lanes he wends his thoughtful way, What time pale sunset gilds the village-spire, And seeks the cottage where he comes to pray, Wherever duty, discipline and care, Faith, hope, and meekness grace his onward path, A Shepherd finds his flock, and feeds them there, And the rich promise of his Master hath. Spirit of Light, of pastoral love and peace, Divine Sustainer! send Thine unction now; And teach the watchman, time gives no release To light the burden of a priestly vow. But bear thou up, and bear thou nobly on! To warn the wicked and the saints to guide, Till thou be summon'd where the dead have gone, Who lived for Duty, and for Jesus died. EUCHARIST. “The most precious Body and Blood of thy Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ.”—Communion Office of the Church of England. Banquet of bleeding Love, by Christ prepared, Feast of all feasts! we turn to thee, Which dying Grace alone declared Manna of immortality; For, when the tomb-call must at length arrive, The Dead shall feel thee in their dust alive. There, sacrifice and zeal in one combine, With brotherhood of blissful love; And faith-born feelings, most divine, Alighting from their Source above: Creeds and commands, and penitence and prayer, With purity and pardon,—mingle there. And who can celebrate the mystic Rite, Perfect and pure, predestined Lamb! Nor feel their glory of delight Who realise the dread I AM, And worship Him with tender awe intense In the deep shade the words “Do this,” dispense? List, now the pealing organ-swell is o'er And hymnèd chants dissolve away, And through yon temple's archèd door Cold worldlings seek the din of day, Sublime the hush! as though the Dead drew near On balanced wing, our beating hearts to bear. Let the stoled Priests their order'd station take; The Shrine of sacrifice and prayer Lord Jesus! Thou wilt not forsake, But be our felt Atonement there; Renew'd by faith, and realised in love, While o'er Thine altar broods the Mystic Dove. Oh! rapt Communion, which can raise the soul To the clear heights of sin forgiven, Scatter the spirit-clouds that roll, And feed us with the food of heaven,— Thine is the hour, when dead and living meet In blended homage at one Mercy-seat! Who comes with cold or criticising heart The outward elements to scan, In this high Feast can have no part, Where God comes down to sup with man; Seeds of Eternity within it lie, Which bud on earth, to blossom in the sky. Though bread look bread, and water water seem To carnal vision dull and cold, Yet sacraments outsoar the dream Of those who nought but sense behold: Faith is the eye by which believers view Christ in the tokens of His Presence true. Thou Nourishment for all baptismal souls, A food high Angels cannot share, The vastness of thy charm controls The hearts which palpitate with prayer Into an awe profound,—but full of grace, For God incarnate, bleeding for our race. Incorporate with Emmanuel's Body all By sacramental union grow, Who Christ their Resurrection call; Though sinful dust they seem below, Faith more than dying Flesh in Man can see, And in The Lord's our true eternity. Soul of all Rites! mysteriously sublime, By whom the fainting Church is fed, Though veil'd in garbs of sense and time We know Him, as he breaks the bread! When Christ dispenses that almighty food, “Receive my Body and partake my Blood.” Refreshment, pardon, and renewing grace God's eucharist to each imparts, That prints a reverential trace Of Jesus on their sainted hearts: And who are they who need no heavenly gift High o'er the world their sinking hearts to lift? Humility and hope this Feast inspires, Chastens the mind, and calms our fear; And cools the uncontrollèd fires Of those who fancy heaven is near, Dreaming they stand on Zion's topmost place Long ere they learn to wind around the base! A green oàsis in this herbless life, This desert lone of dreary hours, Where Time foregoes each warring strife And Love renews her languid powers,— Proves the blest Eucharist, to all who know The weight of this mysterious life below. Thy strength'ning Presence, Lord! we pilgrims need, Sinful, and oft with sadness worn; For here our bosom'd sorrows bleed Till even pleasures grow forlorn, And hues sepulchral robe the world around, Which looks like Lazarus in his grave-clothes wound. And what a bulwark for The Church hath been This feast of sacrificial Love! For time has no dark error seen, The Bread and Wine could not remove; Christ and the creatures, matter, grace, and mind, In these pure symbols meet, to bless Mankind. Dove of the Church! Thou Paraclete, descend, And such anointing grace impart, That round Thine altar each may bend With chasten'd will, and contrite heart; Not with a conscience, such as earth-slaves feel, But touch'd like Peter, with impassion'd zeal. Thus we adore Thee, Thou almighty Priest! Prophet of hope, salvation's King; Here where the lowest and the least May learn the song of heaven to sing, “Worthy The Lamb o'er men and worlds to reign, Who back to God redeem'd lost souls again!” GOD SAVE THE CHURCH. “I speak concerning Christ and the Church.” Eph. v. 32. God save the Church! and guard Her free, Whom Christ ordain'd on earth to be A sacramental guide and friend, Our creed to mould, and heart amend. God save the Church! from Christ She came, And proved Her apostolic name When Rome's Augustine vainly tried To get her free-born faith denied. For long before the Danish clan, Or Saxon, o'er rent England ran, The monks of Bangor move in glory Through the stern page of British story. God save the Church! sectarian Mind In prayerless reason bound and blind, From Her serene repulse hath met, Whose crown remains unsullied yet. Science and learning, art and song, Around Her name and nature throng; Hero and sage, and saint and martyr Have gloried in Her heaven-seal'd charter. So, when I read th' historic past, And see how persecution's blast By rack and dungeon, fire and hate, In vain besieged her queenly state, Present and future both appear Enlink'd with her sublime career; In whom unchanged by friends or foes The apostolic life-blood glows. God save the Church! we challenge all Who English archives dare recall, To match her sainted roll of men Whose lives recall'd St. John again. Parochial Watchmen, pure and high Whose worth and wisdom near'd the sky,— Eternity enshrines their name Who won their crowns through fire and flame! Howe'er ungrateful Time forget On earth to pay the lauding debt, Delighted Angels watch'd below Their counterparts in pureness glow. God save the Church! whose rites control, Chasten, subdue, and calm the soul; Something of earth, but more of heaven To all Her prayer and praise is given. Time and eternity appear To melt the sigh, and move the tear, As oft her liturgy of love Lifts man below to God above. Majestic, too, her haunted shrines, Where sentiment with stone combines: Chantry and choir, and arch, and nave Where lie the buried pure and brave, Breathe mute, but magic eloquence, And through the eye to soul dispense A wordless power of inward prayer, Born of the creed,—that God is there. Nor be forgot our ivied fanes Which crest the hills, and dot the plains; Where gothic roof and graceful tower Wield o'er the heart a witching power: So hush'd and heavenlike seems the spot That time and turmoil are forgot; And Nature her lone sabbath keeps Where child, or village patriarch, sleeps. God save the Church! for rich and poor Alike expands Her gracious door, Who from the cradle to the grave Watches the Souls Christ died to save. The peerage of the Church are those In whom the Saviour's image glows; And in the poorest, grant, that we God's noblemen by saintship, see. There, prince and peasant, man and child, Learn saving wisdom undefiled; And nought is hid by Godhead spoken To conscience bruised, or spirit broken. But, most because the Word of Heaven Is purely to the people given In British language, broad and free, Church of my Fathers! love I thee. God save the Church, and save the Queen! Mitre and Throne have ever been To weal and woe alike related, By Truth revered, and Treason hated. God save the Church! be this our cry Both while we live, and when we die; For, rail Her foemen as they will, The Church is England's glory still! LUTHER: OR, ROME AND THE REFORMATION. CENTRE OF REVEALED TRUTH. From everlasting was The Christ of God Veil'd in the purpose of His love divine. But, God hath no historian; archives none His past eternity to us presents: For, who the motions of His voiceless Will Can number? Saint and seraph here, alike Are baffled, and the dread I Am adore With that religion silent prayer begets, When mind created on Jehovah dwells. Enough for man this truth august to know, Redemption was no after-thought, by sin Awaken'd from thy depths, celestial Love! When first Humanity the fiend obey'd: For, in the councils of almighty grace Thy Priesthood, oh, Incarnate! was design'd Before creation out of nothing sprang. But when, at length, the hour predestined came, Eternity a form of Time assumed, And from His throne of perfect glory stoop'd The Second in the Godhead, and Himself In mortal limbs and lineaments array'd; Then did Emmanuel, on this blighted earth Of sin and suff'ring, body forth such grace As made our orb a wonder-scene of worlds, By there achieving what the God Triune Determined, when His master-work was plann'd,— The vast Atonement blood divine unveils! Who can express Thee, O Thou great Profound Of glory, where all miracles in one converge, And God Himself in concentration shines For ever? Thee The Father only knows, And truly fathoms. Thee the Spirit crowns Sole Prince of Earth, and Paragon of Heaven In Whom the counsels of salvation reach Their glorious summit. Thee bright Angels bend Around, and ever, with enchanted gaze, Centre and strain their intellectual eyes Full on Thy wonders,—dazzled, awed, and dim With Thine excess of all-exceeding love! Thus, how shall erring man, begirt and bound With mental darkness, to the heights of grace Incarnate, like one clear and cloudless view?— For in the secrets of Thy Cross we find A principle, where God alone on God Is acting,—where the Heart almighty beats With mercy, and the pangs of Calv'ry prove His attributes, in full pulsation met. Expression dies before a theme like this, Completely master'd; but, the heart of Faith Breaks into language with outbursting love, And, taught by scripture, thus presumes to cry, “Thou art, O Christ! our intellectual Sun Throned in the firmament of deathless mind; The radiant Centre of almighty love, The mystic Vine of everlasting life, While the dread Trinity in Thee is hymn'd By saints and angels, with commingled praise.” And, all we have, and are, or hope to be, Hangs on Messiah, as the holy source; Who shades with mercy that consuming fire, Which else creation would at once have smit To ashes, when the curse for sin was due. But in the Cross, and by the Cross perused, How featured with significance sublime And beautiful, this breathing World becomes! Creation, by the plastic charm of faith Transmuted, like a boundless temple stands, Where all is eloquent of Christ The Lord. Lo! the broad earth a solemn area seems, And the arch'd sky a bended ceiling grows Whose lamps are planets, in their burning shrines; Wonder is priestess; and the mingled choir, The organ-music roll'd from waves and winds,— While, deep with worship, swells th' unconscious voice Of Nature, when her blent hosannas rise To bless the Architect and Source of all. And say, what merit must The Blood express, That guilt from God in vindication hides? Oft in the night, when musing thought awakes, And well remembers all the world has been; How Sin hath never yet a sabbath kept, From the first pulse in man's apostate mind To the last throb in Treason's bosom now,— Well may the heart, with big emotion charged, Empty itself in adoration's tears: And mind devout, with awed amazement, think How infinite must Calv'ry's pleadings be Which soften judgment, and sustain a world! Thus, every mercy our creation holds, Born of His merit, bears Emmanuel's name; And through His rent and riven side descends, Reaches all hearts, and radiates all homes With christian brightness. Hence, in Jesu's Cross We glory; all our creed round That revolves: For there, to heights of unimagined grace God's Covenant the wond'ring mind attracts And welcomes, till the o'erwrought heart succumbs In mute religion at their mystic base. And therefore, while in nature God we greet, And in the wrappings of this outer-world His garments witness, that from sense infold A Splendour Infinite, a felt Unseen,— Yet not o'er these the heart's most epic strain Lift we of lauding rapture. Though the sun Burn like a mystery of living beams, Filling our eyes with reverential light To watch him; though the moon's poetic brow Be lovely, arch'd with most celestial grace, And yonder meek and melancholy stars Thrill like the pathos of eternity Our pensive bosom,—not in these we boast, Though beautiful: nor in the sacred Deep Who chants his lone and everlasting hymn Of waters, like the psalmody of waves In worship; nor in all the wondrous things Which Nature in her realm of varied life Concenters, can the God-taught spirit trace Matter for largest triumph.—Nor can Mind Such rev'rence claim, as that dread hour demands When burst thy heart, Emmanuel! into blood For sin, and back the forfeit-heaven regain'd. CHRISTIANITY Thus, “God forbid!” a rapt Apostle cries, In aught we glory, but the Cross sublime; Which, planted in this wilderness of worlds, Hath bloom'd with second paradise to man. And think, (unless the terror of that thought Palsy thy mind, or stop the mental pulse From beating,) think what Man and Earth had been, If never from Emmanuel's veins had roll'd The tide of Merit, our atonement drew! What but a curse, a prison, and a pang Had reason, life, and apprehension proved? Amid the howlings of the Law unkept Encompass'd ever, like incarnate hells Men would have lived, have wept, blasphemed, and died! Then, why not, Priests of sentiment and song, Yourselves baptized, baptize your pages too? Oh! let the Cross your admiration deck With solemn beauty, when o'er nature's types, Her hues and scenes, poetic fervours rise; For, all creation is with Christ inspired.— And ye, who through the world of mind delight In thought to wander, lo! The Christ is there; Reason is but a ray from Him derived, That sparkles only with the light He makes.— Monarchs who rule! remember, lawless will, But for His pangs, would rank and order crush; And ye, who legislate for church, or crown, From the deep science of Salvation draw Canons of truth, by creed almighty sign'd; For there, both law and love together form A perfect Archetype, in Whom they blend. Or ye, who in domestic bower enjoy Heaven's fairest miniature, a virtuous home,— 'Tis from the homeless Man of Grief ye draw Your sweets of gladness, when the hearth-sides glow. And Christian! what art thou, but Christ in man, By creed and conduct, character and life Envolved, and still envolving? Thou in Him, And He in thee,—thy life but echoes His; Thy foremost graces are refracted gleams Directly from His perfect glory cast. But, all thou art can faith alone depict: Experience only is description here, And that, internal:—since the life of truth Is learn'd by feeling, and by love acquired: Mere language only is a dead pretence, Aping the life which love alone can reach, Or e'er embody. But, if thus the life Of faith imperfect, far beyond the soar Of speech, to altitudes of secret awe Itself exalteth, who, by climbing words The Lord of Being in His life of faith Presumes to follow? There all language ends, As tenses in eternity are lost! Be this enough for sinful man to know, In Christ the sum and substance of all truths Are met, and manifest; in Him, full-orb'd Religion ev'ry saving virtue finds: For, there alone the heart of God unveils Its vast expression: in the Face Divine Of Him, the arch-Elect, before all worlds In secresy of Love divine embraced, In Christ, the counterpart of Godhead, shines That moral radiance which Himself repeats By humanised reflection. There alone, The fallen Spirit, with an eye unfilm'd By grace, from sin and sensual darkness freed, Pardon and peace in God for man can find. All other media which inventive Pride Presumes to fashion, are but barren dreams: Man's deity is only dust refined, Himself re-cast in some ethereal mould, A finite into infinite enlarged, And this dilation for a God mistook! But Thou, Emmanuel! art the Way we come, The Truth we know, the endless Life secured, The all in all of God to us reveal'd, And us to Him restored.—Creation's book Lies blotted o'er with sin's perplexing stain, And no erasure can Thy name detect, In full divinity of sound and sense Conspicuous, or complete. And, what can Law, That dreadful paraphrase of Justice, speak To lawless Guilt, but condemnation dire? And, how can Reason in her light resolve That problem, deep as God, and dark as guilt, How sin is punish'd and the sinner spared, When falls the sabre of celestial Wrath, And in one flash both heaven and hell illumes? Or say, can conscience, whose rebuking voice In jealous echoes of the jealous God Is ever sounding through the soul within, Can this alarmist, to the shrinking gaze Of guilt, the trembler, mercy's plan unfold? Ah! no: in Christ alone we Godhead find; In Christ alone His character evolves; On Calv'ry's hill God's attributes were throned, And reach'd a climax when their Lord expired. MYSTERY OF SUFFERING. Throughout the universe of God there reigns A ruling harmony of love and law; And thus all worlds, by secret link allied, Together one melodious system make, Wherein each orb a fated portion fills In due relation to the boundless whole. But here, let Reason stand, where Mary stood,— Under The Cross; nor catechise the work The filial Word completed, when in flesh He suffer'd; and His suffering Body taught How God on time eternity reflects, And in the mirror of the church's life Doth glass the features of a sovereign Will, Secret, and not to faculties create In flesh, or spirit, e'er to be reduced. But still, we rest not; and our reason longs Madly to question what no finite mind On earth can answer, when our musing eye Roves o'er the moral waste the church hath been, And dares to criticise what God hath done Or Christ permitted, in this world of ours! For what, but good and evil, strangely mix'd, Seems the dark mystery of the church's doom? Here saint and sinner, grace and nature blend; Angels and Fiends for blood-earn'd souls combine; All passions, principles, and powers remote, (From the high daring of celestial hearts To the low horrors of consummate guilt,) All strive with each, and each with all conflicts. And, who can wind his labyrinthine way Through shades of providence, like these, profound? We see in part; but when perfection dawns, Both part and whole shall then Thy name uplift Almighty! then, the choir of chanting Worlds Around salvation, one stupendous tide Of deepening rapture shall for ever roll, And God His own great Vindication be. But here, we lisp the alphabet of grace Alone, and scarcely that at times pronounce. Infants of time, we yet have much to learn, And more to suffer, ere we find resolved The paradox of wrong the church endures. If to each pang some purpose we could link, Patience might sing, where now vexation sighs For wisdom; but the Vision tarries yet! Between God's purpose and our pang there lies An Infinite, where baffled Reason, blind With gazing, would in vain some landmark see. But grief, when sanctified, is God to man Himself imparting, for some end conceal'd Deep in the core of his eternal plans. Here may we rest; beyond we cannot rise; Or, on the infinite Unknown we dash The mind to madness, and our faith to fears. Perchance, our World to higher Being proves A Platform, where the truths of heaven enact Their natures, and to angels wisdom show. Or, hearts on earth are moral schools to heaven, And pangs below are preachers to the skies, While glory shines around each sainted tear Which faith, or feeling, in our warfare sheds. Perfect through suff'ring!—such Emmanuel was; And can the members of that mystic Head Refuse to echo what their Master felt? A suff'ring Image must the church become If with her archetypal Lord complete Her oneness prove; and what in pangs the Head Endured, each member must on earth repeat By thrilling counterpart in truth, and tone, Of all He suffer'd. Nor in heaven forgot, Though there unfelt, Messiah's woes remain; Still through His splendour point the piercing nails; There in His glory yet the gash is seen; E'en on His throne, a sacramental Lamb Types to eternity the Manhood slain!— And, like her Bridegroom, must the Bride elect From suff'ring deep to endless glory climb. We see by part, but suffer in the whole; There lies the myst'ry! there our flesh complains, Hurt feeling staggers, and the heart recoils. Meanwhile, in vain would Souls their doom avoid, Or mould, or master: each, in turn, must weep, Writhe on some rack, or drink the cup of woe Down to the dregs, if such their God present. All have their pangs, their penalties, and pains, Some thorn to fester in the spirit-life, Or, fret the mind to feebleness, or fear Unholy. But, the Comforter abides! And while to sense the church an orphan seems, The Father pities, and His children find A secret pasture in the promise left, Though all look herbless to the eye of men Carnal, or clouded. Nor will more be felt Than Wisdom, for some destined rank above Apportions; cross and crown related are; The one is suffer'd, as the other shaped, Responsively. And as the artist's hand Plastic with genius, to some picture gives Line after line, and touch on touch repeats, Till colours image what his mind contains Of beauty,—so, in faith, experience feels Pang after pang, till God at length transcribes That viewless copy of celestial life His purpose imaged, ere our souls were born. Or even, as the skill'd refiner bends O'er his fused metal, in the furnace laid, And heaps new fire, till back its molten face His own returneth, by reflection bright,— So in the flame of hot affliction, man By Heaven in myst'ry is a while retain'd; Till, purged of dross, and purified from sin, At last the metal of the heart is clear, And back on Deity by love reflects The radiant image which His glory casts. WISDOM COMES FROM WOE. We learn by suff'ring, while by faith we live, And graces brighten as our griefs expand: But, where indeed, between the woe endured And height of glory in a heaven to come Of being, is the true connection found,— Baffles our reason, in this cloud of flesh Now to unfold. Yet this, at least, we learn, The Head of manhood was a suff'ring Head, And all His members, by their mystic pangs But echo back what Thy pure bosom felt, Eternal Archetype of life and faith, Whom all things emblem! Here alone, there dawn Truths which illumine what might else appear Darkness infernal, deep, and black, and dense To suffocation. Here, some aims profound, Whose roots are in eternity's result, Arrest the tear, and calm to chasten'd awe Secret rebellions of the soul within. The good shall suffer; yet, if goodness be To nature fall'n, but the noble part Of trial, when by sin-consuming grace Pure love is deepen'd,—not for this repine The brave adorers of The Crucified! They glory rather in the racking fires; The more of grief, the more of God they have, And do (what seraphim have never done) Suffer for Christ!—man's pure distinction this! His high prerogative, His peerless crown Appointed. Devils for themselves endure, And angels, quick as sunbeams, glide and go At His command, and own Him Liege, and Lord; But Virtue, by the church's heart reveal'd, Mounts to a range sublimer, and excels Beyond the burning Watchers round His throne: For, she can suffer; and by suff'ring learn Lessons transcending what the angels teach. And more than this th' afflicted church evolves. From Abel's cry, to Luther's convent-groan, Self was our ruin; into that, direct From God, creation's first apostate fell; And out of that, alone can Flesh arise, By will surrender'd, crucified, and slain, And by the sovereignties of Will Supreme Master'd, and moulded. Thus, the saints are train'd From strength to strength, by educating woes, To loathe that vampire of creation—Sin! With hate celestial, and on God to live; While in that Book, whose promises, like stars, Rule in the night, a radiant charm they have, O'er all the dim perplexities of doom Beaming mild comfort, through the blackest woe Which palls the christian, or a church portends. GRIEF AND GLORY. Glory to grief! when thus for God endured; 'Tis but the pang a Saviour's bosom felt, Re-echoed, and by peerless faith prolong'd. The Man of Sorrows forms no men of smiles; Our hearts must bathe in His baptismal fire, Or ne'er be whiten'd; Cross and Crown were His: We grant it; but, in order each He took; The first He suffer'd, ere the last He wore. And as the Bridegroom, must the Bride be form'd,— Repeat His Cross, and then reflect His Crown; That Like on earth, in heaven alike may prove, In grief below, in glory, one above! So, in eternal consciousness to come, Salvation will be sympathy entire 'Tween Head and Members—unity august! When Christ in each will Self from all absorb. Meanwhile, to us, Eternal Spirit! grant The wisdom meek, which lives on truth divine, However veil'd; a waiting mind impart; And in our weakness show our strength to dwell. Like as of old, a pensive Learner sat Low at His feet, and listened to her Lord, Absorb'd and self-renouncing, be our soul Before the Cross in docile rev'rence bent. For Thou, O Christ! amid the fires hast been; And o'er the flames, which on Thy church advanced, The promise, “with you, till the end of time,” Breathed like the spell of some almighty breeze, And cool'd them into impotence, or calm.— No! never hath the murd'rous hoof of Hell Trampled the heart from out the church of heaven; Within her, life, when all seem'd lifeless, glow'd; Within her, grace, when all seem'd graceless, dwelt; Within her, truth, when all seem'd truthless, reign'd; While, ever and anon, amid the gloom Which Priest, or Tyrant, or the Devil made, Star after star in radiant grandeur rose To shame the midnight of the soul away. But, chief o'er all the galaxy of lights To stud the firmament of christian fame, Shone Luther forth,—that miracle of men! A gospel-hero, who with faith sublime Fulmined the lightnings of God's flaming Word Full on the towers of Superstition's home, Till lo! they crumbled; and his with'ring flash Yet sears the ruin with victorious play. But thou, who o'er the church a thoughtful mind Haply in moods of mournful awe hast bent, Revere the fact, whose deep foundations lie Far in the Infinite, beyond the wings Of faith, though plumed with apostolic strength, To follow:—Christ hath God with man conjoin'd By union so unutterably close, Divine, unfathom'd, and for ever firm, That sun shall wither, all the stars wax pale, Mountains depart, the heavens to air dissolve, And the dread universe itself shall die, But, this Conjunction shall unweaken'd stand When Time is dead, and Nature drops extinct Into her grave eternal. Boundless truth! Which out of Deity all other dwarfs To less than littleness, beyond compare. All unions type it; all connections preach; Nature, and art, and pure affection's ties Are fill'd with emblems, shadowy, dim, and faint, Th' exceeding glory of this bond to tell: Wherein, by unity of mystic power, Christ and His Church are into One transform'd Colossal Person, Spirit, Life, and Frame, And Fellowship, and Feeling. Let that Church Suffer a pang—the Saviour feels it too! Touch but a Member, and you thrill the Head With shock electric, on his Throne perceived; And therefore, Tyrants! when ye wound a hair Of God's anointed, up to heaven your wrong Ascendeth, and the heart of Jesus strikes! Rays in the sun are not so brightly close, Trees to their root are not so firmly knit, And streams to fountains not so close allied, Body with breath, and both with soul combined Together, as the Church and Christ cohere. Hence Earth, nor Heaven, nor Hell that fights with each, The Bridegroom from his sainted Bride can tear. Thy Maker is thy Husband, Church elect! And rich eternity thy radiant dower. And thus, we lift the shout, and song of faith Victorious: for the Oneness is so true Between the members and their living Head, In vain creation may be tax'd for types Or teaching shadows, to portray its power, Since mere analogy in light is lost; Upward, and heavenward illustration mounts, Till, near the throned Almighty, overawed, Faith cannot soar, but folds her duteous wing, Backward recoils, and trembles into prayer. HUMAN NEED, AND DIVINE SUPPLY. E'en like an instrument, whose chorded depth Enwraps the unheard music, but awaits A master-touch of some awaking hand To make it vibrate, did the high-strung world Of truth and feeling for impulsive souls In solemn hush abide, beneath whose sway The moral harmonies of ransom'd mind In mingling swell of holiness, and love, Once more should waken.—Luther was that soul Predestined! he, by grace divinely arm'd, From the foul grave of papal sin and gloom The buried Gospel came to disinter. And let us laurel his intrepid brow Who faced alone (by all save Heaven unarm'd) That priestly Giantess of pamper'd sin, Whose throne was blasphemy by pride upheld; That brazen Arbitress, whose sceptre robb'd The King almighty of the soul's domain, Even papal Rome! who still her wine-cup drugs With damning charms, and deadly spells; and dares Within the heart's pantheon yet to shrine Dark falsehoods, which redeeming truth bemock, The soul profane, and parody our God. Eternal hallelujahs rise! and ring That Grace around, which call'd the champion forth, And with heaven's panoply his spirit clad For combat. With the energies of hell To grapple, with incarnate fiends to fight, Behold him summon'd! On that lifted brow Heroic calm indomitably smiles; And in that lion heart each pulse which beats Throbs like an echo to the cheer of heaven. Behold him! grateful Mem'ry, come and gaze; See Luther, from eternity decreed, Rise in the majesty of moral force From superstition's grave to heave the world, And bid it look upon the Cross, and live. And oh! what marvels did that Mind achieve, Which in itself a Reformation was. For cent'ries, deep the night of falsehood reign'd, Mildew'd the Soul, and manacled her powers With fett'ring darkness; cloister'd Learning pined In cell monastic; Science grew extinct; The Bible moulder'd in scholastic rust; That Fountain, from the Saviour's wounded side For sin once ope'd, by sealing lies was shut; And, 'stead of His bright garb which Mercy wove Of perfect righteousness, by Jesu wrought, Spangled with graces, rich as God's own smiles, The filthy rags of ineffectual works Clad the cold skeleton of naked souls: While on his throne of sacerdotal lies, The arch impostor, Satan's rival, sat Self-deified, and ripen'd earth for hell. Then, Luther rose; and Liberty and Light The soul unbarr'd, and let salvation in. Hark! the dead Scriptures, into life recall'd, Harangue the conscience; lo, the Gospel lives; Swift from the Cross infernal darkness flies: Martyrs and Saints, like baffled mock'ries sink To nothing, by victorious truth dispersed; O'er fancied merit free redemption reigns; And in the temple of a soul illumed No venal priesthood, with parade of lies, And sacraments of sin, can enter now: There, Christ Himself by triple office rules, King, Priest, and Prophet, on the Spirit's throne. THE SOLITARY MONK. The solitary Monk, who shook the World From pagan slumber, when the gospel-trump Thunder'd its challenge from his dauntless lip In peals of truth, round hierarchal Rome, Till mitred Pomp, and cowl'd Imposture quail'd, And each false priesthood, like a fiend unmask'd And stripp'd of light fictitiously assumed, By some detecting Angel, shrunk dismay'd And shiver'd, in thy vast exposure seen,— Thee would I image, thou colossal Mind! For what, though sad humanity's broad taint Of weakness, here and there thy soul diseased; Or, harshly quick, or, too severely loud Some intonations of thy spirit rose; Yet, in the greatness of thy glorious work Right nobly art thou, like a second Paul, Apparent, graced with apostolic zeal; Waving that banner, on whose blood-stain'd fold Thy name, Emmanuel! at each ruffling blast Of conflict, beams with awful brightness forth. Thee would I vision, and on Mem'ry's glass Some traces of thy many-colour'd life In lines of holy miniature reflect. For in thy destiny our God we find Himself expounding, by the truth unveil'd. Upon thy mind, as some prophetic map, Almighty love mysteriously engraved An outline wondrous of the work decreed; Thy moral Self a Reformation seems; And in each phasis which thy soul presents, An imaged counterpart of all we trace Hereafter, in the world's vast scene evolv'd. And therefore, Hero of a hundred fights Celestial! morning star of Jesus! rise, Rise in full radiance; through the cloud of time Dart the rich beam of evangelic day, And cause the Church's heart to glow with thee. But yet, how low, to Reason's carnal eye Which measures all things by the scale of sense, The means appointed for the end pursued! How strangely small those intermitting ways By which, to great results, God's wisdom moves! Yet, once a manger did th' Almighty hold, When first Messiah's human life-pulse beat For our behoof. And were not they, who hurl'd Philosophy from off her Babel-throne To speechless ruin, and our rescued souls To the rich fountain of celestial Blood Directed,—were not they, the peerless Twelve, Whose words like arrows pierced the heart of Hell With fire and fearlessness, the low and weak, Of man unlearn'd, but learn'd in much of God? E'en so, from out a shepherd's mountain-hut Far in the wilds of Alpine bleakness hid, The Swiss apostle ran his high career; And he, who, with the sun-like mind compared That Luther in his flaming boldness show'd, Soft as the moon in mellow radiance seem'd, The mild Melancthon!—from a clanging home, A martial workshop, dates his lowly birth. And Thou! the Reformation's mental spring, The Bible's loved redeemer from the cell Where monkish falsehood barr'd its glory in, Not from the loins which heraldry admires Didst thou proceed; of poor, but pious blood Wert thou; a simple miner call'd thee son. PROLOGUE AND PREPARATION. When God to matter gave the fiat,—Be! E'en like an echo, heaven and earth arose, The instant product of creative Will, And Will alone. But when His hand divine The great Idea, 'fore all ages form'd Concerning Manhood, would in shape express, Lo! in The Godhead consultation moves, The Persons think, the Attributes confer, And, “Let us make him!” is the awful Speech Which symbols out to human sense, how vast And wond'rous was the master-piece of heaven, Who imaged forth the Trinity, when Man Rose on the scene, as lord and light of all. Thus Reason, here, may with Religion cry, “Oh, what a Fabric eloquently deck'd With strength and grace, our regal nature is!” A mental structure, for whose living walls Eternity and Truth foundations were. E'en such is Man, when fully bodied forth By daring energies of mental worth, And virtue. Hence, when heroes pure and high Rounded and finish'd into full-orb'd grace, On earth at length are destined to alight, E'en like some new apocalypse from heaven, Truthful and deep, and most divinely touch'd In faculty of heart, and mind, they show In each high lineament the stamp of God. And such was he, who burst the jail of thought, Shaking each fetter from the dungeon'd soul Of ages; and to 'nighted Faith restored That creed almighty which the Cross enacts. But e'en as Luther was through grace confirm'd, And shaped in secret, by the truth applied In the lone temple of his God-taught mind, By man untutor'd,—so, the creedless world A Hand eternal and an eye unseen By gradual prelude did prepare, and guide; That when the true Regenerator came, A platform might await him; and his Work Fit audience find, to welcome its advance. And means there were, successive, stern and slow, By which, as organs, Providence achieved Each consummation that His will forecast. Time after time, some lone Elijah lifts His wail august for Liberty, and Man; Truth had a voice; though much unseen remain'd, Like pearls of beauty in a shell conceal'd. Soon Dante's hell of poetry began Full on the Pope to flame a fierce revenge, For virtue: Petrarch call'd on kings to rise: Then Genius, with her tongue of many tones, Learning, and Art, and philosophic Scorn, At once inspired, their banded forces hurl'd On the huge vice the Vatican uprear'd. And, long ere this, the great Arabian Lie Had rippled into life the stagnant pool Of priesthood:—foul and faithless at the core, It yet the unity of God preserved; And by the scoff of its sarcastic light, Lurid, and keen upon the monkish cowl Reflected,—good and gracious work achieved. Remedial truth all falsehood underlies; And thus Mahommed's arch imposture did, Beyond intent, in this high prologue act A part momentous. Next, from Alpine-homes The exiled Gospel sent its mountain-cry, All Europe thrilling. Then, the Schoolmen rose, And, wiser than their conscious wisdom knew, Embalm'd each verity their words o'erlaid In secret amber,—safe from popish tact. And thus, (so wonderful the links that bind Thought into thought, along the chain of time!) From Lombard's heaven-awaken'd breast was thrown A burning ember of immortal truth Pure into Wickliffe's; thence, to noble Huss It glow'd along to Jerome's kindred mind, And he to Luther did that spark convey: And so that Bible-spark illumines now The hearts of England with its holy life And lustre, though seven hundred years have roll'd Their tide of darkness o'er the Schoolman's head, Where first 'twas kindled by a ray from heaven. Here are the signs, predictive as profound, That all betoken, with precursive truth, Some Advent mighty, which an empire's heart Shall welcome. These are like a Baptist-voice The earth haranguing, with its glorious swell. But when that crisis of the world arrives, How doth a Hand almighty o'er the scene Move unbeheld, and write the coming doom! See Reuchlin, by his classic lore inspired, Utter aloud to God's dead language, “live!” And hark! the Bible, like a Hebrew seer, Again may preach and prophesy to man: While e'en Erasmus, cold and cautious thing! (A craven neuter in the cause of Christ) Whose head was light, but in whose heart no love Was kindled, rose beyond himself at times, With blasting irony to sear and singe The monk-born vices: thus, that orphan'd youth To God his genius and his love inscribed, And voiced the Bible with a Latin tongue. Nor dare we to progressive mind alone The conflux strange of tendencies, and truths Refer, which just before the battle-voice Of the brave monk around the Popedom hurl'd Its dreadless challenge, into force arrived, And action. Mark, at once, a mental blaze Beyond all precedent, by Heaven illumed. And first, that fearful Thing which rules the fate Of battle, thund'ring over field, or deck, With havoc wing'd on its resistless roar, Is now compounded; next the Magnet comes, With true polarity, that ever points, Like sterling principle, to where it tends; And marks old ocean, like a map with lines Of knowledge, till the wave-toss'd pilgrims roam And coast all seas, all countries, and all climes, Far as free commerce wafts them. Nor, the least In rank, nor last in the resulting power Thy fall, Byzantium! Though the Turkish flag Moved in fierce triumph o'er thy crumbled walls, Yet did the Orient with a gush of mind Burst from its mounds, and through the arid West Pour the rich blood of intellectual life And learning. Next, an unimagined World For ages cover'd with Atlantic gloom, Secret of waters by stern ocean kept Inviolable, at length, her silence breaks, And lo, America on Europe smiled, Shaking the heart of nations with delight! Marvel on marvel!—each with vaster range, Or new excitement, thus to Man appeal'd; Heighten'd the tone of morals and of mind Awaken'd, roused the soul from monkish sleep, And thrill'd the student in Platonic bower Or cloister'd umbrage, with electric throes Of more than rapture:—for the social frame, From east to west, did vibrate with o'erwrought Emotion. Seem'd it then, as if the Earth Again were heaving with prophetic throbs, Sent to precede her soon descending Lord. So fast did providence itself expand, Nature evolve, and kindled genius rise And forward into fields of glory rush. Yet, in this prologue of adjusted means Heaven-moulded, chief and prime of arts immense, See, Printing rise, a universe of powers! That bids the Past become perpetual Now, Gives reason sway, imagination shape, To time a soul, to thought a substance lends, And with ubiquity, almost divine, For living permanence and local power Each ray of soul immortally endows. MIGHT OF THE PRESS. Thou great Embalmer of departed mind! Thou dread Magician! by whose mental charm, A mournful, pale, and solitary man Who pines unheeded, or who thinks unknown, Long after dust and darkness hide his grave, Himself can multiply, with magic force Beyond the reach of language to explore, And the wide commonwealth of minds may rule With sway imperial! Who can image Thee, Whether to heaven uplifting mind and man, Or hell-ward both seducing, like a fiend? Boundless in each thine unremember'd sway! Thine was a voice, whose resurrection-blast Peal'd through the catacombs where buried Soul For cent'ries lay, and lo! with living might The Fathers burst their sepulchres, and breathed; Dead Intellect from classic tombs came forth Quicken'd, and into active substance changed By thy vast potency: and then, was felt The pith of thought, the marrow of the mind Itself transfusing, like a second life The old absorbing, as with heat divine. And since that moment, have not Books become Our silent prophets, intellectual kings, Anointed hierarchs of human thought To vice, or virtue? Are they not like shrines For truth? cathedrals, where the chasten'd heart Can worship, or in tranquil hours retreat To meet the Spirit of the olden time? Since there, the drama of the world abides Yet in full play, immortally perform'd. Still ride the fleets o'er Actium's foughten waves Before us; patriots fight, and tyrants fall; Sparta and Corinth, and the famous Isles Which fought for freedom, till their blood ran o'er With brave contention, there convene, and clash Their forces; still the Roman eagle flies In full-wing'd triumph o'er the subject world; Cæsar and Pompey yet the earth alarm, Or, drag their chariot with the captive East; Battles are raging; Kingdoms lost or won; Yea, all the genius of gone time is there In Books articulate, whose breath is mind. And, was not Godhead in a work like this, When the World took a most enormous stride Forward at once, to freedom, life, and law? Priesteraft and Falsehood (that terrific pair, Who murder'd Truth, and made the church become A dungeon, where imprison'd Thought expired,) Trembled, as if that dooming blow was struck Which fell'd them into nothingness, or names For ever: God indeed was now at work, Though Man, the organ, was alone reveal'd. BOOKS AND THE BIBLE. But, why are Books such half-almighty Things, Making, or marring, whatsoe'er they touch, With force internal? Whence their wond'rous spell? Bethink thee, reader! and the answer comes. The universe itself was once a Thought, A thought Divine, in depths creative hid; And so, whate'er this mortal scene invests Of human action, is but plastic thought Itself revealing, in some forms without Apparent. What is half these eyes behold Of boundless, beautiful, sublime, or vast, But thought embodied into outer shape, Or, answ'ring symbol? Arches, cities, domes And temples, fleets and armies, trades and towns, Yea, all the might and moral of mankind To this significance at length arrives, And backward into thought may be resolved By fair reduction. Now, if Books be thought By printing clothed, and palpably endow'd For its vocation, whether art, or lore, Poetic vision, or prosaic truth, Kingdoms immense, or individual Souls The aim of its predestined mission be,— Forth to its work that printed Thought proceeds; And who shall track it, as it rounds the world? Who can imagine, when 'tis once abroad, (However humble was its natal home) The Work it dares, the wonder it achieves? Black as a Fiend, or like some Angel bright That Thought in action, may itself approve; For printing, like an omnipresence, gives Its power expansion; far and wide it moves, Reaches all hearts, a host of minds affects, And executes what none, save God, controls! Oh, 'tis enough to harrow breath and blood With chilling horror, thus to feel, and know, That when some Thinker, who debauch'd his soul And put damnation into print for fame, Is cited to the last and long accompt, His thought is living! like a demon, still Haunting the world of passion with its power, Or poison; breathing a perpetual curse, And dropping hemlock into sensual hearts Which love the venom which a lie instils; And thus, for ever! not perchance to cease, Till Thought and Thinker shall together stand, Cursed by their victims, at the bar of God! So great are Books: and what the Bible, then, By printing voiced, and through all regions sent To speak the errand of celestial Love! Here was the Prologue, in consummate form Develop'd; here the Prelude looks divine: That God in words, descending into Man, And there achieving all its creed affirms Of goodness, that the Bible thus should have An Organ ready for its godlike mouth, Here is the Wisdom which on high o'errules, Making all hist'ry but her echo'd will! But now, the world is waiting: prescient Hearts In mute expectance, big with wonder beat, Predicting what these powers commingled mean, Or, Who from out the heaven of truth shall come Mankind to marshal, in this pregnant hour? Shall Prince, or Potentate, or armèd Force Girt by the squadrons which the world arrays, March in the van of Liberty, and Light? “E'en by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts!” Again that motto to Almighty ways Becomes embodied, and to life transform'd: For lo! the Reformation's human spring, Unknown, unseen, in cloister'd shade retired, Is framed and fashion'd by the Hand Eterne: Here, from the depths of convent-gloom, He calls The Man He loves, the instrument He wields, And moulds him for the mighty Work decreed. But Him, who now a beacon o'er mankind Flames in the lustre of his far renown, The Spirit summons from no royal scene, From throne, nor palace, nor ancestral hall; But chooses, in the wisdom of free will, A fameless Monk, of poverty and prayer, And leaves the palace for a miner's home. GOD'S HEROES. The Kings of mind, who govern from their graves, Our thoughts their subjects, and our hearts their homes Perennial, when they first in light emerge, Like new expounders of almighty Will, Forth from the secresy of truth unveil'd Glad tidings bring they, of a Glory meant Yet to awaken, and the world invest. Their utt'rance, large; their meditation, lone; By passion for the Infinite o'erpower'd, They dart their glances into Things to come; Intense, beyond the teachings of the soul To reach, or satisfy. But, how received, These new Avatars, sent on missions high, To herald forth eternity in truth For all who love them? Are loud welcomes rung? Greetings of head, and jubilees of heart Do these salute them with applausive joy? Alas! too holy the vocation far Of Truth's high Priests, when first behind the veil Of outward things themselves presume to pass, And bid us follow, with responsive track Through the rent shroud their faith had first undrawn. Time is their justice. When their tombs are rear'd, Then, Wonder dares to consecrate their deeds; Will call them, primates in the church of man, Great Nature's own episcopate they form, And rule, like metropolitans of mind. But, mark the conflict when their voice emerged! Struggles within, and all without them, rose. Their great Impression was the God unseen, But felt, an Infinite through finite glimpsed; Yet, how they falter'd! of themselves afraid, When Thoughts in vain articulation sought; Or giant Apprehensions, dim and deep, Scarce ventured forth in intellectual shape And bodied meaning! Oft, expression fail'd In form to realise what feeling grasp'd: Language was only a prismatic mean But half refracting, with imperfect ray, The truth essential, which they purely saw Single, and one, within the soul contain'd. But when the mind could stammer forth its tones, Profound, original, and preaching high On God, and Nature, Science, Man, and Soul, No music breathed they to the world's dull ear. But, harshly strange, and dissonant they seem'd, With fruitless paradox, for sense unfit And reason dang'rous! Such the first salute Prophetic genius from the world obtains: And such have earth's regenerators met, From God-called Moses, to the German monk. But if to Morals and to Man they bring Authentic tidings from the Throne of Truth, Divine, yet most disturbing, scowl and scorn, Affronting coldness, and condemning fears Assail them ever, with a shameful wrong, From all who love the ancient, but the new Abhor, like treason! Thus the world, self-blind, Hath greeted oft how many a regal Soul That rules her now, with legislative awe! Wisdom itself seems heresy to fools; And freedom is but license to the slaves Who love the fetters, which their languors fit. Their light is darkness, and their being death, And rotting silence all the soul admires, Admits, or sanctions, in that dormant calm By cent'ries gather'd o'er imprison'd mind. E'en like a temple, where the owls retreat, And the bats lodge within long-moulder'd shrines, Ope but a window, let a sun-burst in, And what a screaming anarchy awakes Where falls the light, or sounding footstep comes! So, in the temple of deserted Man Where sin for ages unmolested breeds, Or lying Errors long repose enjoy, If but a day-beam of immortal truth The gloom dissever; or, a living Thought, Divine as heaven, original from God, Down from the skies should suddenly alight, And walk his spirit with a kingly tread Majestic, what a host of wild alarms The priests of Dulness round the stranger raise, And call it mad, the dead in mind to wake! MARTYRDOM. Here is the doom of Hero, Bard, or King: The cross of hatred first their hearts endure, And then, the crown of homage on their heads Dying, or dead, at last cold Justice puts! Their crown we witness,—has their cross been weigh'd? We boast their triumphs,—have we told their tears? We laud their greatness,—have we felt their gloom, Their lonesome watchings, and their weepings long, The fret, the fever, and those wasting pangs Year after year, which wore the heart of Youth To sickness, ere the laurell'd moment came When truth and triumph paid high Merit's due? Result the many only dare to prize; But still, the process solemn, stern, and strange, Through stormful agonies, and griefs, and glooms, By which a Hero to his great result Attaineth, why should this no homage win? Luther was great at threat'ning Worms, we grant; But, greater still in solitude, and tears, When first he grappled with his fiery heart And, in the prison of a papal creed, Panted, and pray'd for evangelic day. Heroes are martyrs, if their minds be pure And highly-temper'd; for, the Truth is strange To men who only by their bodies live, And to the pageantries and powers of Sense External yield their sympathies alone; Or, never down Themselves presume to gaze With eye reflective: so, when prophets rise, And utter oracles from deeps of Life Hidden, and heavenly, from the Flesh remote, To them they sound like necromantic tones; Eye, ear, and taste, compose their All in All; And though around, within, above them moves And lives, an energising Power Supreme, Whose vesture is that Visible they love, They give no credence save to flesh, and form. Yet, what is genius, but a mouth for God To speak Himself to Nature, and to Man, And from the visible and vain of sense Attract us unto mysteries divine, But viewless, by external semblance hid? There, Faith's reality alone is found! Since all expression which the Outward bears, Is but a token of God's inner-truth And purpose. Thus, beneath a veiling shroud The Infinite an awful Presence robes, His thought embodies, or reflects its power. IMPERFECT AT THE BEST. Yet, what is life, but imperfection's breath, And human Being, but incarnate fault E'en at the best, howe'er by grace refined? Moses was anger'd; David's honour fell; Paul felt a thorn, and Peter proved untrue. Genius hath faults, and Luther's none o'erveil. A brave restorer of departed truth, No hollow semblance, and no heartless shade Came he on earth to manifest, or preach. Manful, but rugged, to the centre bold, His heart beat fiercely; and his blood ran fire When Right divine, or some disastrous Wrong Challenged his faith, or forced his feeling out In action; then, the soul's tornado raged, And shook the spirit to its moral roots! Stormful, and strong, and gusty in his moods, Oft the black whirlwind from some ireful cloud Roused his rent bosom with disturbing rush, And hurl'd propriety from off its throne Amazed, and master'd. His was battle-life; Great-hearted being! with a lion plunge Full on the foe, with all his living fire Leapt his free soul, magnanimous as firm, And,—no surrender! for the Truth must fight, And Faith prove conflict, if she stand sincere. Spirits may be, like flowers from heaven that fall, Deck'd with fine beauty, clad with mental bloom Most delicate, but soon earth's tainted soil Bedims them; trodden in the dust they lie, Forgotten, faded, or defeatured things, Ere yet they open'd their immortal buds Of virtue, or their perfect fragrance gave. Not such was Luther's: like some burly oak Whose boughs wave battle with the tearing winds And bend, but never break,—his fighting heart Contended with all mutinies, which came From prince, or pope, from circumstance, or creed, And wrestled with them; or, with Samson force Subdued them, or himself with glorious fall Laid prostrate! Sinful oft, his moody ire Betray'd him; unadvisèd words he spake; And sometimes, when the fervid heart grew wild, Scatter'd both friend and foe with burning force And tameless fury! Like a soul on fire, The gentle wonder'd, and the wise condemn'd To see him thus by evil lightnings rent And harrow'd: but, how soon the tempest died! When the broad sunshine of forgiving love Blazed o'er his spirit, like a summer-noon Settled and bright. Not always hot and harsh Did nature find him; playful moods had he; For oft that smiting earnestness of tone Which scorn'd the false, and cleaved all fiction through, Priestly or papal, with a forcing might That flash'd with fierceness, like a sword's descent, Melted away; and, like an infant lull'd, Pathetic Luther all the poet-life Of purest feeling testified, and taught. Witness, ye tears! that dropt o'er Tetzel's bed When reft and dying; and o'er thine which fell, Beloved, and lost, and beauteous Madaline! Oft in the granite of a soil unhewn Full many a flower in secret freshness smiles; And many a stream, where all looks arid blank, Lurks in the Horeb of some heart, unknown. E'en such was Luther, with his rocky front And jagged features, to the foe display'd: But sweet affections, sanctified, and soft As ever water'd human breast with love, Gush'd into force when Feeling's reign began. LUTHER, AND THE AGE. Luther had faults, but can a feeble age When forms heroic, such as olden life Admired and moulded, are to faith and fact No more; when little-hearted Truths prevail; When Mammon chiefly is the standard used, And God's own world, where angel-wings yet play In secret motion o'er the homes of men, Is made an engine, whose mechanic force A mill can work, or manufacture sway, The mighty prowess and majestic heart Of Luther read, with comprehending love? Belief hath vanish'd in the vast Unseen; And earth ungodded, to presiding laws Is given over with a heartless lie, Till scarce their unbelief some dare believe!— But Luther's was a lofty soul, which felt Beyond the body, life's true secret lay; While faith in Goodness, God, and Truth reveal'd, Subdued his being with o'ermastering spell. And thus, by quick intensity o'ersway'd, He often stumbled, where the colder stand Securely guarded, in their frost enshrined. “Luther had faults!” but, oh, ye little Minds Less in your faith, and lesser still in deeds Which make the hero, or the man unfold In full-soul'd daring, while the outer-life You ponder, have ye pierced the core within? A fool can censure where a prophet weeps, When life is only by its faults and falls Review'd: but underneath, what noble tears, What pangs remorseful, penitence, and prayer, What struggles mute, what passionate regrets! Deep in the bosom—there begins a fight! And there the battle-scene 'tween Flesh and Faith Unfolds its grandeur. All without appears The moral echo of that inward din, A mere reflection of internal strife In fitful shadows thrown on human eyes. Yet, these are chiefly what adjudging sense Accredits; character from these is drawn; And so with Luther: bold as blazing fact, The failings of his outer-life advance To catch the censure of prosaic eyes, And hearts which never with emotion sway'd Themselves, or others. But, the secret fight Internal, when his wild and wasted soul Struggled, and strove, contending with the Fiends Of darkness, baffled oft, and bleeding faint, And yet, right up ward, through eclipsing gloom, Through storm and danger, and internal wrong, From famish'd boyhood e'en to fearless man Advancing, with a most unconquer'd will To God and virtue,—who hath laurell'd this Or wreath'd the record with a just renown? But, true biography in heaven is writ, And every heart-beat throbs a record there. 'Tis therefore, by successive falls they rise Step after step, through stormy grief and gloom, These Benefactors to the boundless mind, Patrons of soul, and true philanthropists. Hail to their glory! Let the sceptic rave; There's something godlike in the truly great; They find the lever Archimedes sought, And fix its fulcrum in the soul of Man And nobly lift him to our destined skies. Like parts and portions of the primal True, Like apparitions from a purer World, Like human echoes of great Nature's heart, Whose beat is holy,—fresh from God they come, And summon man to virtue; or, expound Our vast relations with the Infinite. Their words breathe might; oracular and strong, Direct from deep Reality they roll Like inspirations: or, with soul array'd, Their meanings fall with fulminating burst Full on the battlements of ancient Crime, And crush them!—thus, their mental tones Are sleepless echoes to the ears of Mind For ever; time with them is all attuned. Yet, though these Spirits bear th' almighty stamp, And challenge far beyond what earth bestows Of homage, yet the world is all unwont Voices from out the solemn deeps of Thought, Divine as theirs, to rev'rence, or regard. And Luther, like his fellow-heirs in fame, A great minority, a glorious One A while stood forth, unaided and uncheer'd. But here is greatness,—when by truth possess'd, Earth, Sense, and Time, alone to face and feel. And where, save in the armoury of heaven, Found the brave monk a weapon for his fight? And that was Faith! in God, in Good, and Truth, In Beauty, Wisdom, and celestial Worth, Heaven-rooted Morals, in the deathless Mind, But chief, in Duty!—dread and awful Thing! Which o'er relations from Th' Eternal drawn, Reaches on high, to where God's throne is rear'd, And downward to Perdition's wailing hell Extendeth.—That which holds our being fast, And binds together with uniting band All facts, and feelings, faculties, desires, All that we suffer, fancy, dream, or do From life's first pulse of reason to the last, This power and principle of Duty makes; To finite deed gives infinite result, Calls the dead Past to resurrection-life, Harangues the guilty, and that hour predicts When mem'ry into one concenter'd whole Gone life shall grasp, and startled Conscience hear How the last trumpet can our thoughts restore. OMNIPOTENCE OF FAITH. Faith was the weapon! by it Luther fought, Conquer'd himself, and then, the world subdued. And what is That, but God by man applied Above all reason, sense, and earth, and sin, In things heroic, heavenly, or sublime? From Abel's worship, e'en to Samuel's word Faith was a magic which all wonders did; Whether the pausing sun its cry obey'd Or, the Moon hearken'd to its holy spell, Or, Red Sea parted, by its kingly voice Cloven, and balanced like a billowy wall On either side, for heaven's anointed Host, Scatheless the fire, or mute the lion's mouth Became,—whatever in the kingdoms three Of nature, providence, or grace, was done, Faith was the doer, at whose potent cry Empires and thrones, and alien armies fell, Weakness grew strength, the mortal, half divine! And what, without it, seems this fallen world But Pandemonium, with a purer name? Clothed in hell-fire, come any Shape of sin, Take any form, satanic Guile! but this, The Infidel!—the fellest blight which falls. No foul elixir of a fiendish lie So baneful as the cup, which Unbelief Drains to the bottom with delirious joy. Oh! 'tis a wasteful, with'ring, black disease That to the vitals of all virtuous thought And wisdom, sends a paralysing shock; The very life-blood of all goodness dies Before it; like a heart-fiend, lo! it rules; All forms of excellence and feeling die, The Beautiful departs, the Brave expires; Hope hath no heaven, and fear no hell to face: All high relations are at once relax'd With God, and duty; self and passion rage In the hot furnace of a seething heart Resistless; men are now but fiends, with flesh Apparell'd; lust becomes a brutal flame, And all those moral harmonies, which make Nature a noble, Man a godlike thing, Have perish'd! Life is then a form of death; The heart's insolvent; mind a bankrupt too; Jehovah in eclipse Himself retires, Till thus, all ghastliness the earth appears, Orphan'd of God,—a suicidal world! Here was thy rock, thy fortress, and thy rest, A faith intense, beyond mutation firm, Whose solid basis was th' eternal Heart Open in scripture, by the Spirit read, But in the life of Jesus heard to beat With pulse almighty, in its love for man. Here was thy spell, thy secret, and thy sway, Thy lock of strength, unsever'd and unshorn. Luther! in this thine earthly comment lies. Here is the key, which all thy soul unlocks, And lets mute Wonder, with exploring gaze Each hidden region of thy spirit view. Faith to thy being sun and shield supplied, Summon'd the soul, and nerved the noble heart With zeal untamed, to burn, or bleed, or die, But tremble never!—Thine was spirit-life, Whose solemn breathings were from scripture drawn, And adoration; while, both heart and head Motives and movements from the world to come Divinely influenced with inspiring force, Or sanction. Thus, thy mission was complete, Thy virtue safe, and thy vocation seal'd. Whether we mark thee, when that rugged face Beam'd in bold triumph o'er the flaming Bull; Or on thy forehead, where intrepid thought Throned its high meaning in the hall of Worms, Admiring Hist'ry fix her spell-bound gaze; Or grateful Fancy, by the gospel led, Bend o'er thy Bible, when some midnight-lamp Lighted each feature, as the truths divine Rose into life, by thy translating touch Restored, or brighten'd,—still, in all we find Faith was the secret power, whose shaping charm Moulded the man, when most he grew sublime. And, whatsoe'er our rank, degree, or lot, Giant or dwarf in morals, or in mind, 'Tis faith alone true character can build. Not as we learn, but as we live, we are; And as we live, with things divinely pure, These in their depths, we rightly understand. Since faith is rooted in eternal life; And all fair promise in the tree of man Blossoms from thence, or dies a mocking show Fruitless, and fragile. Give us faith, O God! Faith in Thyself, and that will Thee impart; Chaste will life be, and calm its closing hours, To them who have Thee, all their hearts and souls Possessing ever, and by them possess'd. In Thee, and by Thee,—thus they live, and love, They think, they suffer, what they act, achieve! In all things, heaven and holiness abound; Minutest objects Thine hand-writing prove, And Life becomes one grateful hymn to Thee. So, when that trump, whose archangelic peal Shall sound the tocsin of creation's doom, Thunders its challenge, Faith shall then arise And, firm as Jesus on The Judgment throne, Look on thy face, Eternity! and smile. THE CHILD PROPHESIES THE MAN. The hand of Jesus on thy heart, O child! In love was laid; He watch'd its hidden play, And heard it throbbing with unspoken prayer. Thou fair inheritor of mortal flesh, Typing the kingdom of the unattain'd! Prophet! with mighty revelations mute; Thou priest! with sacrifice of soul to come; Thou king! whose monarchy young feeling rules, Meanings around thee, full of heaven declare 'Tis like religion, when we look on thee. A deep heart thrilling with the Unavow'd, A spirit dark'ning with the Undescribed, And his whole being rock'd, and urged, or rent With big emotions, beautiful and strong, On Mansfield plains, behold, that destined Boy, All that is great in earth, or sky, adore. Earnest he is, and most intensely true; Free-hearted, bold, with open forehead graced, Rude as the wave that roughens in the wind Resistless; gifted with a fervid soul, Mirror'd by eyes, where mental radiance beams, And yet, withal, by sadness mildly touch'd At being's centre; meditative, lone, And quiet often, as the placid cloud Cradled at twilight in the lulling west. The vernal freshness of life's dewy morn Bedecks his nature, like a magic bloom, And mantles all things. Now, with dreadless play Opens the heart at feeling's lightest touch; Time hath not barr'd it with those jealous bolts By Prudence framed, which bid the stranger wait, And knock for years, before he enters in To find a welcome. All is bold, and free, Unguarded; giving forth a quick response To each appliance from the passing scene; Promptly as flowers to breezes yield their scent, Or boughs their music to the playing winds That bend them: such is youth's excited frame, And such, though brief the guiding annals be, Was Luther's. Genius is a glorious one; And all her children like impression bear Of their high parent. This, in after-life, Back on dim boyhood darts explaining gleams, And proves the child then prophesied the man. Luther in germ, may now in heart be seen; For, what is manhood, but the child drawn out, By mere expansion of that moral seed Which buds and blossoms into perfect man, Whose ripen'd germ is character full-blown? And now, fair Beauty, Grandeur, Form, and Grace, Yea, all the felt significance of life Inner, and deep, begin their blended reign; And so inspire him, that material earth Turns one vast mirror to envisage mind. And with what boundless, sateless, unsubdued Young appetite, his spirit thus partakes, At each fine inlet, all this God-made world Before him, like an inspiration spread! E'en as a sail to catch the coming breeze, So boyhood opens its expectant breast, Panting for beauty, at each conscious pore. And hence, in all things youth's poetic faith Beauty perceives; or, by perception makes The beautiful, a virgin heart admires. Thus, flowers are fancies by the Earth produced; The clouds, emotions of the Tempest born, The arch of heaven, how eloquently high! A bright archangel of the burning east The Sun ariseth, on his wings of light How watch'd, and welcomed! Then, comes Night august, A dread magician! with her sybil-stars Attended; and the twilight Sea is made Creation's poet, with his billowry lyre Rolling for ever an unconscious chant, Or broken swell of oceanic hymns. Blood, heart, and brain, the beautiful inhale; Matter and mind a very duel fight By sweet contention, in some high-wrought mood Of young entrancement! Forms without, appeal, And thoughts within, like answ'ring music, play; Till life itself a lovely poem seems Tender, but touch'd with most impassion'd tones. So rapt is youth, and fervidly entranced When genius fills it with her hallow'd fire, And all the open Secret of the world Round a lone heart its earthless magic brings. Such the boy, Luther; simple, rough, and rude, A thoughtful earnestness his brow enthrones Beyond all shrinking. His the cloudless heart; And men may read it with a ready glance. Like glass transparent, do his actions show That hidden wheel-work which the heart involves. GENIUS, SOLITUDE, AND SYMPATHY. Genius was thine, thou heaven-commission'd Boy! But surely, Sorrow was thy guerdon too; Since ne'er doth greatness in a bosom lodge, But Sadness thither, like a shade, attends, Its true companion. In this faded world Our graves and tears are almost equal, now; And, e'en at best, light-hearted youth must bear A burden voiceless, and the pang unbreathed Of many a dark and undevelop'd mood. The earth is exile; and for Home we pine How often! when high visitations come From whence we know not, and the mind o'erwhelm. As if some Angel by the flesh immured Our Spirit were, within whose conscious powers The sounds and splendours of ethereal life, In dim remembrance, were at times renew'd.— And did not he, whose pure vocation was The Infinite with finite things to join, Wrestle with thoughts, his yearning boyhood strove In vain to answer? Felt he oft no thirst, Like a young Tantalus, by mocking bliss Encompass'd, melting from the parchèd mind? And did not Dreams, and Solitude, and Night Profoundly move him, till prophetic thoughts Imaged the future? Rapt in speechless awe, Ponder'd he not on that behind the Veil, When round him, like a belting zone which binds All time, all scene, all circumstance, all change, Divine Eternity in shadow came? We know not this; but, e'en as eagles soar And sky-ward through the rending storm-cloud mount With plumes unbaffled, Luther's wingèd soul Against the blast of Circumstance did beat, And struggle upward to a destined sphere. From want and woe his educated will The glory of its resolution caught; E'en from the cradle, tears his teachers made, And suff'ring, hard as adamant, engraved Lessons which left throughout all time their trace Instructive. Thus, amid the true and stern, And keen realities of testing life, The Boy was rounded into full-orb'd Man And fitted for his function. Thus, a Soul Predestined, for its prophet-work was train'd, And grew heroic: till at length, the world In full apocalypse of all its powers Emerging shall behold it act, and speak. And like the hammer of a christian Thor Down on the Curse of christendom and man Descend, with most annihilating crash, His tones of thunder and his truths of life! But, in those powers auxiliar, which expand The young Reformer, feeling play'd its part; And that, perchance, beyond all others, pure. His was a mother, from whose heart of love Sacred and deep, with fine devotion full, As from a shrine, his lisping boyhood took Counsels of grace, oracular and fond. And who can say, how much that Luther show'd In his high work of majesty and mind, Which grateful Empires with their homage crown, Sprang from a look, a warning, or a word, A mother wielded, when she taught him God? And ever thus, from love maternal spring Feelings and powers, which o'er progressive life Reign with a subtile, secret, holy spell: And deeds, and darings which have moved the world A cent'ry forward, from a mother's lip Caught the first glow whence inspiration came. Yet, bleak the lot his boyish prime endured! And sad, indeed, and merciless as dark The shades of circumstance around him fell; While yet, no precious dawn of grace appear'd His soul to lighten through domestic gloom. But, on his cheek a blanching terror came When He was named, within Whose wreathing arms Of mercy, once, a folded infant smiled! Foodless, and friendless, oft the fainting boy Far from his home, with none, save God, his guide, In Magdeburgh from house to house was doom'd A meal to beg; and thus, by Heaven was school'd To hard experience, when Hereafter came. “Bread for the love of God!” hark! Luther chants From door to door, through Eisenach's winding street, Mix'd with a group, as wan and worn as he Of students poor. But lo! as once he lay Beneath the umbrage of a cottage-tree, Alone and pensive, while the leaf-shades fell Like soft expressions on his speaking face Of suff'ring, sad and sweet the hymn he sung; The very echo of his soul was there, And, like the fragments of a broken heart, His shatter'd feelings trembled into song. But not in vain that plaintive scholar mourn'd; For on the ear of Ursula they sunk, Those tones of truth, like tears upon some heart O'erburden'd, dropt from Friendship's genial eye. Never again shall that pale youth despond In Famine's grasp, through days of pining gloom! At once, both heart and home their shelter ope, And, like the Shunammite, her all she shares With him, the homeless boy of sorrow, now. Blessings be on thee! Cotta's lowly bride, And praise immortal, for the feeling hand Which dealt thy substance; and the angel-voice That, rich as dew-fall on a summer eve Descending, when the fev'rish earth-sod pines, Besoothed the world's great benefactor, then! For here, by want unchill'd, by care unworn, Bosom'd in calm domestic, Luther builds By soft degrees, his mental being up. Science, and Art, and Lore, that lovely trine! Around him throng, and with their blended smiles The budding energies of mind attract Forth into blossoms of expanding force, And freshness; e'en as sunshine tempts The hue of flowers, and harmonies of spring To full expression. Home of halcyon ease! When the loud roar of his hereafter-life Deafen'd the heart, how oft did Luther love That sabbath-haven of the soul to haunt With mem'ry's eye: and once again recal The bliss of tranquil being, when the noise Of man's great world with no disturbing sound The soul distracted: like the far-off waves To one who, pensive at his window, dreams, When twilight o'er the palpitating breast Of Ocean melts in rosy calm away,— The soften'd echoes of a distant world But served to make the hush of home more dear. And Music, too, her poetry of sound Evoked: for oft, when Evening's pallid veil Curtain'd the clouds with beauty; or, the Moon A mild entrancement from her beam inspired, Did Luther hymn the golden hours to rest With deep-toned chants, and melodies divine; Where voice and lute each other's echo seem'd, So richly one their combination grew.— When years had flown, and Europe's grateful hand Round Luther's name a wreath of glory twined, And at his feet the heart of Empires bow'd Admiring, Cotta's home, still unforgot, Was outlined in his mindful heart of love Serene as ever; while his voice proclaim'd, By gallantry and grace at once inspired, There's nothing sweeter than a woman's soul When Truth divine erects her temple there! UNIVERSITY. “Who prays the most, will study best;” so spake, In noble answer to official pride, A young Reformer, when th' unfolding gates Of Erfurth from his asking eye retired, As pale he stood, her letter'd walls beside Intreating entrance there. And now, commenced The waking myst'ries of his mind within! Around him, more and more, dread shadows fell, Which seem'd reflected from Almighty frowns; While conscience, that pale miniature of God! In outlines faint, the Holiness Supreme Began to image. Morning, noon, and night, With soul intense, and heart of upward gaze, How oft did Luther on the wings of hope Rise out of earth, heaven's tearless home depict, And on Christ's bosom pillow all his cares! 'Twas then, while sensitive at ev'ry pore, His soul lay open to the pregnant beams Of truth eternal, from the heavens derived, That Mercy-seat of everlasting mind, The Bible!—first on Luther's spirit breathed. Yet, little thought he, when the dust-worn shelves Were traced, some intellectual food to find, How God in language to the conscience speaks When faith in scripture hears the Spirit there. And scarce could Seraph wave his wings of light With ecstasy of more celestial glow, Than did the student, with his raptured eyes To heaven upraised, the heart's rich anthem peal Of thankful wonder, for this costly boon! That moment was the Reformation's seed; That Volume, then, the universe outweigh'd In mental preciousness and moral power! For in its pages slept those living germs Of principle, from out whose depth have sprung The faith, and freedom of a christian world. FALLEN NATURE IN RELIGIOUS FORMS. Say, how can man be justified by God? Challenged eternity would echo, “how,” But from The Cross responding grace replies To this high question: faith in Christ is life, And love, and righteousness, completely fit To each vast claim of violated Law. Thus, conscience finds no compromise involved; Nor Mercy from the hand of Justice grasps The sceptre, and her awful head uncrowns; But there, all Attributes divinely blend In one rich centre of consummate light, And God, with most benignant glory, smiles His goodness forth, o'er ransom'd souls and worlds. But he, pale thinker! in portentous gloom Robed by the rags of papal righteousness, Was shiv'ring yet: around his spirit coil'd The clankless fetters of condemning law; And upward, when his heart to gaze presumed A moment, soon it shrunk, appall'd and dim, From God's dread eye-glance, flaming with the curse! Dark wrestler with the pangs of sin untold, Silence and solitude his haunt became, Transforming nature, till the soul was typed In all he witness'd, of the bleak and wild. Down lonely vales, and paths of soundless gloom, He loved to meditate, and learn'd to mourn; But, chief the night-blast, with its hollow yell Rung from the Tempest's riven heart of sound, Becharm'd him, when beneath the wat'ry moon Late roaming. Still, the crisis came at last!— 'Twas summer; and with crimson eye of fire Full o'er the pine-tree boughs the west'ring Orb Sunk flaming; like a furnace glow'd the air In breezeless trance, while not a bird-wing moved; And forest-leaves, as by some fixing spell Enchanted, like the lids of slumber, hung Subdued, and motionless: so deep the hush, Your very heart-pulse strange and loud appear'd; When, lo! the blacken'd cope of heaven divides, And flashes; re-divides, and with one fold Of sheeted flame the firmament involves. Hark! peal on peal redoubling, and return'd With raging echo, till heaven's arches ring And vibrate; then, in one convulsive burst The clouds are clash'd to thunder, and descends Down at his feet, in supernat'ral roar, A death-bolt!—Harmless as the rain-drop fell The blasting ruin; Luther, in the shade Of that great Hand, Whose hollow hides the church From storming earth and hell, was all secure, Though death glared round him. What a scene was there! In kneeling agony, with eyes of awe To Heaven upturn'd, as if the judgment-pomp And equipage of heaven's almighty King Emerged apparent, Luther throbb'd, and pray'd; And vow'd his after-life to God alone, If safely rescued from the whelming storm. So sank a great Apostle, when the blaze Bright as That form of Glory whence it fell, Abash'd him into blindness, and he heard The mournful thunder of Messiah's lip Rebuke him, till his conscience rock'd and reel'd. But now, all faithful to his word, sincere In darkness, to the blinding creed he loved, Hark! on their hinges grind the massive gates Of St. Augustine's cold and cloister'd pile, And in the clang of those reclosing doors, The knell of Luther's freedom! Darkly bound By dread theology's remorseless chains Of monkish falsehood, in the deep of night, Fresh from the haunt of social youth he comes Self-exiled, and sincere, in convent-gloom Amid the graves of unproductive mind, Where dead religion putrified to fear And fear to superstition,—there to lift His soul to God, and fashion it for heaven! Yet, mark in this eternal Wisdom's plan. A dungeon'd martyr, on whose haggard limbs The rust-worn chain its branding trace hath delved, When free again beneath the skies to walk, Inhaling liberty from each loved breeze Which carols round him, chief o'er all can tell How priceless to the heart pure freedom is! And thus did Luther, by whose dreadless hand Of truth, base fetters from the mind were fell'd, As captive, first by dark experience learn How deep that dungeon of the spirit was, Where Roman witchcraft plunged, and plagued mankind! Yes, he, the champion of Jehovah's cause, Whose bold harangues, like Alpine thunder-peals Hereafter shook the Vatican to shame, Himself once crouch'd, in martyrdom of zeal, Beneath the lashes of a monk's stern lip In silence; wound the clock, and swept the floor, And begg'd, a charter'd mendicant, from house To house, the bread of blushless charity! But, found he there the holiness he sought? Did peace divine in purity descend Down on his conscience, like the calming Dove? Ah! no; in vain the convent's round of rites, The fastings dull, the macerations dire, The penance long, the midnight-watchings pale, All the mean clock work of monastic life, Wheel within wheel, by superstition turn'd! From righteous acts no righteous nature flows; First form the nature, then the acts arise Spontaneous, free, by fertile love produced, Not pleading merit, but proclaiming Christ Within, by transcript of His life without. For, how in Self can man salvation find, When self is sin, connat'ral and corrupt? But, like that Bible, which his sateless eyes Read oft and oft, with most devouring gaze Of faith and feeling, Luther wore the chain Which round the soul rank Superstition binds. Yet, oft the heavings of his spirit rose In dark reflection, to his pale-worn face! While e'en the whisper of that still small Voice Which cowards all, but christians maketh none, Beneath the roof of his o'erarching cell Raged into moral thunder, when stern thoughts Of God in judgment, tore with tort'ring might And mystery, the troubled mind within! Thus, like a spectre, through the cloisters moved With fruitless sigh, and ineffectual groan, Day after day, all spirit-crush'd, and worn, The helpless Luther, till the Cross appear'd: From holy love then true repentance sprang; And faith, like Mary, at the feet of Christ Attending, hung upon His lips, and lived. REVIVAL. Celestial love! no self-created sound In the cold depth of man's corrupted heart, But rather, a responsive echo, waked By Love supernal, art Thou, when sincere. By God's to man, man's love to God begins; And christianity is Christ received, The soul possessing, and Himself possess'd. Then thaws the heart, however iced and dead, In tears which glow with gratitude divine. So Luther felt, when Love's almighty voice Becalm'd him; round the Cross he ever read The page of heaven, and in that Fountain wash'd His soul to whiteness, which for sin unclosed In streaming mercy from our wounded Lord. Light, peace, and order round his being throng'd In rich communion; prayer and praise arose, Like native incense from the soul renew'd; And holiness, man's paradise regain'd, No effort now, but second nature seem'd,— Not labour done, but life itself enjoy'd. Yet, who can tell, as stern-eyed Law retired And the mild Gospel o'er his conscience breathed Like Jesus, when He sigh'd the breath of peace, How on his heart the Bible's image grew, Till, like a throbbing counterpart, it beat In living echo to the truth it loved! While doctrines now, which once with scowling front Black as the shades which over Sinai hung, Appall'd him, soft as Christ's own pity, smiled. No more the penance vile, with venal aim To bribe Eternal Justice, was achieved: In Christ her all-in-all stern Conscience found And, sprinkled with His blood, her claim withdrew For ever: penal Law its lightning veil'd; And when from sickness, pale and purified The convert of the Cross in health arose, He clung to Jesus with a clasping soul Devoted, lifted high o'er legal fears, And from His wounds saw earth's atonement flow. PREACHER AND PULPIT. “Go! stand the living and the dead between, Take the rich censer of Messiah's grace And stop the Plague.” Such looks the Office high To him appointed, who the tidings glad Proclaims of Liberty to souls condemn'd In the black dungeon of the Curse to writhe, And weep for ever. Well may dread, sublime As holy, soften'd o'er with human shades Of feeling, round some youthful Herald steal, When first the embassy of Pardon rolls In strains of heart from his excited lip, Which vibrates, like a chord by music thrill'd, Master'd by young emotion. What a theme! God in our Flesh, to save that Flesh, array'd, The Infinite within the finite lodged, The form Almighty in a frame all weak, The dread Creator on the Cross unveil'd In bleeding glory!—Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, Eternity and Time, and Sin and Grace, The choral anthems of the blood-bought Church Circling the Lamb with coronation-joy; Or, wild Perdition's cry, in lurid flames Stretch'd on a rack of self-tormenting ire,— These are the elements combined to throw Around a Preacher that commanding spell Of awe, which makes the earthen Vessel bend, To think it treasures such a peerless trust! And, who can dare himself sufficient deem For work so fearful, where seraphic Minds May travail in the greatness of their strength, And yet, not scale its altitude divine? Oh, Thou! Whose office 'tis the Word to bless And quicken, till it breathes a living grace, Thee may we ever prove in presence nigh As Great Inspirer; Whose anointing power Alone can tune the “sounding brass” to Heaven's True note, and bid some “tinkling cymbal” do In mortal accent, an immortal work! Whether beneath yon bow'd cathedral roof Of vastness, while the organ's billowy peals Roll like a sea of melody and might Down the dim nave, and long-retreating aisles, Thy Word is preach'd; or in some Saxon fane, Where rude simplicities, of ancient mould, Linger in stone's most exquisite decay; Wherever on the tide of human breath Floats a rich argosy of Gospel-truth, As Christ appointed, may dependence be The preacher's motto, and the preacher's mode; Dependence meek on that concurring Grace Of Him, the Bible's Author, by Whose light Alone our sermons live, and souls are saved. FIRST SERMON. So felt the young Reformer, when he rose Within thy square, high-fated Wittemberg! Where the grey walls of St. Augustine's fane Crumble in low decrepitude, and dust; And from his pulpit, piled with simple planks, Blew that loud trumpet of Salvation's truth, Whose echoes yet the heart of empires stir. Eye, cheek, and brow, with eloquence array'd As though pure spirit would incarnate be, Or mind intense would burn its dazzling way And be apparent,—like a Saxon Paul Flaming with truth, the fearless Herald pour'd Himself in language o'er the list'ning throng Around him! With a mental torrent ran The rich discourse; and on that flood of mind Nearer and nearer to the Lamb's white Throne The soul was wafted, while for Christ he spake, And hid himself behind the Cross he raised. A more than Hercules, to cleanse a church Where priestly falsehood stabled all its guilt Through cent'ries dark of domineering crime, So seem'd he then; and in that sermon gave A noble prelude of the trumpet-blast Predestined from his daring lip to roll Hereafter, when from lethargy and lies He roused the Autocrat of Romish priests In cruelty, and curses, till there came An avalanche of everlasting truths Down on the Popedom, in those thund'rous words Which crush'd it, like th' apocalyptic Stone Hurl'd by God's angel through the blood-red sea. METROPOLIS OF ANTICHRIST. To shameless Rome, the capital of sin, When Crime in canonised pretension smiled, And Pride and Lust pontifically reign'd, At length, great Luther comes. The glare of skies O'er which the mercy of no soothing cloud Had floated, vainly tried his toil-worn frame; For still, o'er Alpine crags, by torrents wild, And hoar ravines, within whose rocky depths Yell'd the loud streams their everlasting cry, The Monk of Wittemberg, with eager step And soul expectant, sought the seven-hill'd Queen Of cities; till, behold! in glimm'ring haze Her turrets, towers, and giant temple-spires At length emerge: and low upon the ground, In kneeling homage, falls her duteous son, To breathe his blessing o'er maternal Rome, Mother, and Mistress of the churches all! But when her pillar'd streets of pomp he trod, And on those ruins, eloquent and vast Around him in sublime confusion piled, Gazed with devotion,—what a gushing sense Of ancient glory through his being swept! The past in tow'ring resurrection rose Bright from the tomb of ages; while the air Which Peter breathed, and Paul himself inhaled, Play'd round his temples, like a breeze from heaven New-wafted! Rome and rapture were combined; And Luther, in one lofty dream of soul Enchanted stood, and drank the glorious scene; As if Religion from the very stones Was preaching where Apostles once had trod, And over which the martyr's flame of death Gleam'd in dread radiance, like a glory now. But, soon the bandage of imposture fell! And then, e'en like the Arch-fiend's mystic pomp Summon'd before Emmanuel's heaven-bright gaze, So fleetly vanish'd into viewless air Thy pageantries, thou Babylon of guilt, And scarlet Lady with the costly blood Of God's elected, drunken and bedew'd! Since, then reveal'd in all thy hideous truth, He found thee but a leprous church of lies By ages putrified, in papal form. Oh, grace divine, and wonderful as deep, That Rome and Luther should confronted be! And there, in Superstition's heart, one text Almighty, like a thunderbolt of truth Down from the throne of Revelation cast, Should raise him, while he crouch'd in dismal faith, Deluded! Thus, the Champion for his cause Was train'd; and thus from Rome herself he drew Weapons of might, whereby her powers would fall. Hence, swift recoiling from his task abhorr'd, Uprose the brave Reformer! free and firm For ever: “By his faith the just shall live!”— Thus came a Text from Inspiration's lip: Religion, then, and Luther's mind arose Erect; upon the rock of faith alone Together did they face the frowning Hell, And bid our spirit in the Lord stand free! INDULGENCES. “Lo! at yon gate,” the Mercuries of sin Are crying, “Stands the awful Grace of God!” And, in one moment, like a moral wave Heaves far and wide the town's excited heart; Council, and nuns, and priests, and monks advance, And motley crowds, from ev'ry lane and street Are rushing, while the festive town-clock peals A loud hosannah from its lofty spires, And tapers flash, and greeting cymbals sound, To meet the great Procession. See! they come, In robes how costly! There, in cushion'd pomp The Bull of grace, whereby the Godhead's hands Are bound, and His dread thunders must awake Or sleep, as priestly conjuration bids! For now, before a wooden cross uprear'd Bedeck'd with Leo's blazonry of pride, The loud-voiced Tetzel takes his stand profane: Prime vender he! beneath whose venal lip Heaven's attributes, as in a mart exposed, Are purchased by Indulgence; Christ is sold In pardons! Sin itself, before conceived, Or acted, by the Pope's almighty Bull, Shall not be damning: whatsoe'er Desire May dream hereafter, through its charm absolved, Shall be forgiven!—“Down this cross there flows A grace like that the Saviour's bleeding side Dispersed; but hark! from deeps of ghastly woe Where yelling Spirits clang their chains of fire, Tormented parents, friends, and children, lift Their tongues uncool'd, and cry for needed alms To bring them from that red Abyss of wrath, Where scorch their souls in purgatorial flames! Let but your money, with its golden clink, Yon chest descend, and, lo! at once escaped, Those dungeon'd Spirits, wing'd by papal grace, Full into heaven's bright welcome flee!” So cried that dread impostor; and the souls Of myriads, by anointed lies seduced, Imperill'd; Christ himself, in blacker shame Than once the Cross of Calvary o'erhung, Was openly to mocking Hell exposed; Eternity a mart of sin became, Or, papal auction, where that grace was sold For filthy lucre, which the costly Blood Which warm'd Emmanuel's veins, alone procured; And 'gainst the purity of Heaven's high throne The breath of human blasphemy arose From Pope, and priesthood. Seal'd the Bible, then! And sure, if ever down a Seraph's cheek Roll'd the rich tear immortal feeling sheds, It trickled now, when thus religion dared In words divine God's heart of gracious love To libel; Christ's own pangs for venal lies To barter, till the Truth of heaven betray'd, In priestly suffocation sank, and died. But, there is mercy in thy myst'ry lodged, Eternal! Out of darkness cometh light By Thee evoked; and, while the anarch sin To mortal judgment, in its clouded gaze, O'er time and circumstance sole monarch looks Ascendant, all the waves of human will In lawless riot though they toss and plunge, Within the circle of Thy will supreme Alone are heaving; if they rise, or fall, 'Tis only as Thy secret law ordains. REFORMATION. Pale with devotion, wrestling long and lone With God in prayer, behold! the lion heart Of Luther beats with supernat'ral pulse, And throbs for Deity, and great design. Stung to his very soul with piercing shame Beneath a lie to see heaven's truth expire, And trampled Scripture gasping in the dust Of low venality, and priestly lies, Upon the door of Wittemberg's dark pile He fasten'd then, with hand divinely firm, Ninety and five of those all-fearless truths Which shook the Popedom, and the World redeem'd From charms infernal, to the Cross alone. Faith, hope, and love, upon the Rock of souls Were founded; Grace in gospel-freedom rose, From Schools and sophistry at length escaped; And from the fountain of Emmanuel's Blood Both peace and pardon in conjunction flow'd, Free, full, and glorious from the heart of God,— Giver and gift in amnesty combined! And yet, what eye save His, before Whose beam Time, place, and all contingencies retire As though they were not, in this daring act Of Luther, heard the Reformation's pulse Of Life and liberty begin to beat? Or who, among the crowd that rush'd to read In tumult wild, upon the church's gate, Those Words, which dash'd Indulgences to air, The silent thunder of their strength foretold Upon thine eve, All-Hallows? Monk and priest And Pope, and hoary-headed Falsehood, then, Were death-struck: in those few fine truths The germs of unexpanded glory slept, As in the acorn future navies float. And when at night a lonely cell was sought, Could the brave Monk his deed of pregnant might Have measured? In the greatness of the act, Oh, was he conscious of th' Almighty, there? JUSTIFYING GRACE. One truth divine, from deeps of scripture drawn, And by one heart with burning zeal espoused, Then, bodied forth in majesty of life, What miracles that single truth achieves Which rock an empire, or a world restore! And hence, when pale in his monastic gloom, Alone, and pensive, groping after God Through clouds of error, black with Romish guile, At length the tortured monk, with tears of praise, Consummate pardon in the Cross alone Discover'd, then, a peerless Truth was found From whence instructed Empires learn to live. And in that hall, where stood the fearless man Bulwark'd with principle, beyond all powers By earth created, or by hell contrived, He grasp'd a truth which Heaven's eternal creed Hath canonised, and by the Cross explain'd,— That Grace is God by God alone applied: On this, Religion all her fabric rears, That else, is baseless, as the yielding air. Hence flow those energies through man and mind, Which mould our being great, or make it good. Here, by the pardon of perfective grace, The anguish'd memory can alone subdue That dread Gehenna, which our guilt inflames Oft in remembrance; and, from thence derived, Pure emanations spring, and feelings act Which feed with moral life the social frame Of men, and nations; for the heart is free, And guarded Conscience on the bosom's throne Reigns in the sanctity which Christ inspires. 'Tis thus, where dreadless martyrs often fail'd, And ancient heroes their protesting voice Lifted in vain, to vindicate The Truth From all aggression, Luther's prowess smote The Roman Beast to ruin, nigh to death,— And that, with principle! 'Twas here he fought, He grappled with the foe of God, and man. Swift through the night of man's imprison'd soul He pour'd the beam of evangelic day; And where Authority, in mitred sway, Fetter'd weak conscience with infernal chains, He throned The Gospel, in the light of Grace At once the law, and liberty of souls. But, had he only on a mob of “saints” Shot his keen arrows of sarcastic truth, Or, laid the monk's Augéan darkness bare, In form regen'rate, but with life corrupt, The Reformation then had toil'd, and died. But, glory be to Him whose Name we bear! 'Twas grace in principle which Luther taught: Here is the lever which the world uplifts,— “A Saviour just, for man unjust hath died!” Here is a Truth, whose trumpet-voice might preach The Pope's religion into airy nought; A truth, which is at once the text of texts, Making all scripture music to our souls. The Bible read, is God Himself perused In pages letter'd with almighty love, When thus proclaiming what the conscience craves: While the rich fountain of Emmanuel's Blood Not barricaded round with priestly walls, Nor blent with superstition's blackening tide Of “merits,” now its healing flood of grace Full on the heart in one vast current pours! He ended, thus, where ancient Minds began; 'Gainst outward vice those murder'd Saints appeal'd, And perish'd: but for Principle Divine, Bravely alone the monk of Erfurt fought. He struck the root,—and then, the branches fell; He purged the fountain,—then, the stream roll'd pure; The deep foundation down to hell he shook, And then—the Roman superstition reel'd: From centre to circumf'rence, did the soul Of Luther reason out its lonely way; Till, lo! at length, by Gospel-light reveal'd, He saw impostures, in successive types Each after each more canker'd, and corrupt; And in the Pope that Antichrist discern'd Whom Daniel vision'd, and St. John unveils. GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MAN. I.—Supremacy. “Son of the living God! The Christ Thou art!” So spake, by more than mortal wisdom led, The bold Apostle, when, through flesh and blood Divinity within the Form august Of Jesus, shrined in mortal clay, he saw: And on the “rock” of this confession, high In Godhead rear'd, and deep in Manhood based, Emmanuel built His everlasting Church. But how hath Sin, from out the promise made To Peter, in apostleship sublime, But not supreme, beyond his fellows rank'd, The Keys of power, the Kingdom, and the Laws Which bind or loose, as papal nods decree, Derived!—and thus on earth enthroned A vile dominion, measureless, and vast As Guile could plan, or cheering Hell applaud. Admire we then, let gratitude adore The Power divine, which hurl'd the Popedom down From that cursed height of blasphemy and crime, To which, through ages of gigantic skill By fell gradation, it at length arose;— Reigning aloft, stern Arbitress of kings And thrones; dispensing sceptres with a smile, Or else dissolving Kingdoms by a frown! For Peter's shadow, and the Roman name O'er power and policy together ruled: Then, the high Past a holy magic breathed; And the rich lustre of a world's regard Made Rome the palace of Mankind appear, The true Metropolis of priestly hearts, A Temple, with apostleship instinct, The stones all sacred, and Her dust inspired! Thus magnified, and with mysterious charms Endow'd, behold, a miracle of pride Erect! Supremacy, thy Pope survey, A Breath of sin on Deity's great throne! Oh, never in the luxury of lies Hath Self more wanton'd; never in this world Hath Adulation's most besotted dream A foul pretence so hideously assumed, As then, around some ruffian Pope began; For, palsied Reason to his sceptre bow'd, And Blasphemy baptised a monster, “God;” Disgust, be mute! and horror, speechless stand! 'Tis not in language, though each word be fire, Or, fang'd with truth's most execrating force, A Pope to paint, when deified by sin. All right above, beyond all law secured, In errorless perfection shrined aloft; Of Peter's royalties sole heir, and king; Of churches, Judge; of christendom the Lord; And, such an oracle!—that when his lips Shall condescend some great response to give, Virtue is vice, and vice may virtue be, Or, each be neither, if his nod decide! Since Truth and Nature are at once transform'd By him, the world's embodied Fiat, now. E'en more than this!—to heights of sin beyond These climbing blasphemies of folly scaled, And from the temple of Jehovah took The crown, and from the Hand Eternal robb'd The sceptre, till from Godhead's self there seem'd To pass all glory; and, in pontific shape, A mock almighty was the Pope adored! II.—Mystery. Above, beneath, around, where'er we move Or live, an atmosphere of myst'ry floats; For ever baffling with its gloom unpierced The pride of reason's analytic gaze. E'en like that Pillar, which, of cloud and fire Contemper'd, to the pilgrim-church bestow'd A guidance solemn, through untrodden wilds, So human knowledge, in this world forlorn By shade and light alternately prevails, Too dark for pride, too vivid for despair. And thus, accordant with our state corrupt, From truth to truth, the educated soul Through shades of awe is humbled yet advanced; While noble ignorance, that knows itself, Kneels in the shadow of a Mercy-seat And prays the heart to piety, and love. Yes! all is myst'ry: from that blaze immense In which pavilion'd dwells the Vast Unseen, Down to the insect of minutest frame, Science is mock'd. Within retreating depths The Cause uncaused, above all causes throned, Who can describe? Yet, what religion owns, Plain reason grants,—that He is perfect One Pervading all things with His presence whole; Unfelt, unform'd, unheard and undefined, All Eye, all Ear, all Spirit, and all Power, His center, Light, and his circumf'rence, Love: Yet, what reveals Him, Who all else reveals,— The Unexplain'd, who yet explaineth all? What sun to systems, God to truth appears; But still, apart, impenetrably shrined In secresy of light, for ever veil'd. Then turn to nature, eloquently touch'd With living beauty; and in sight and sound Teeming with all which holy Truth admires: There, though a shadow of the primal Curse Dims the soft radiance of a virgin-world, Traces of Eden, tracks of angel-feet Still haunt creation with a hallowing charm: But myst'ry, still, o'er nature's Secret broods, Beyond philosophy's most daring ken To master; lock'd in mute reserve it lies. Since, what is Essence, how formation acts, Or life and law reciprocally play,— Can reason here mount explanation's throne? Nature herself is thine embodied Will Almighty! There, at last, the mind has gain'd An ultimatum which unteaches pride; While Genius, like a second childhood, stands, And, rapt in wonder, to Religion turns. And, does not Providence our life invest With one horizon of perpetual cloud? But while to man, his planless life appears A problem made of paradox, and gloom, Darkness itself may Deity enshrine When acting mercy, in deep wisdom, there. But now, within, profound Logician! gaze; Down thy deep hell of consciousness descend, Who o'er Jehovah thus presum'st to wave The treason-banner of rebellious thought. Thou, to thyself embodied myst'ry art; And why? Because unfathomably bad, And thus, by grace unfathomably heal'd! “Deceitful, vain, and desperately vile All things above, the heart of man is found; And who can know it?—I, the Lord alone!” Thus chants a prophet; and we seem to hear Round all the regions of created soul Ring his dread challenge; mute alike remain Seraph and Angel, and the star-bright Host Who, nearest to the fountain-source of Mind, 'Mid radiance intellectual, shine and sing:— To each and all unsearchable abides, The heart of Nature in the human breast. Then, turn to grace,—the Trinity express'd In threefold glory, yet divinely One. There, all is myst'ry, hung with moral gloom. Flight after flight, in vain proud Reason takes, And seeks and soars, and soars, and seeks again, And more confounded by the search becomes: Till, all exhausted, like the arkless dove Back to the shelter of a simple truth The soul retreats, and learns by faith to live, And love the more, the less it understands Of the Great Secret which salvation hides,— The how, and why, in all of Godhead, there. And Him, the Paramount of living grace, The Truth Incarnate, how can words reveal? Or who by comprehension yearns to grasp Emmanuel's Person, in our flesh array'd?— True greatness is to know how small we are, Who learn divinity by loving God, And as we love, alone can understand. III.—Mystery of Iniquity. And thus, at length, analogy conducts Our hearts to Thee, the consummation dire Of myst'ries all by Antichrist sustain'd! Around it more than twice six hundred years Have travail'd, in the pride of priestly art; And now, a very prodigy of mind Depraved, of truth corrupt, and power abused, It moulds, and masters all whom it beguiles. Compact, complete, symmetrically form'd To fit all hearts, whate'er the sensual frame, Or oscillate to each exacting move, Mental or moral, varied life presents,— This myst'ry plays the Proteus with mankind. From character it draws responsive tones; From all condition wins a pleased support; In circumstance, the very crisis wields, And of weak conscience takes advantage vile: Virtue and vice alike its charm obey; And, forging chains that with no clanking fall The ear arrest, or rouse the dormant soul, The heart it manacles with fettering guile, And binds it down, deluded to the last. “A myst'ry” was this antichristian spell In wisdom by prophetic Paul foretold; Nor aught which infidels have dared, or done The Lord of souls to crucify again, Like this imposture hath mankind seduced. There, falsehood in its open vileness reign'd; Conspicuous, mark'd, and branded as the bad, The heart may shun it, and securely keep Both principle and purity awake. But here, false Darkness, with a face of Light Deceptively upon its victim smiles; And, by the aspect of an angel's love, Ruins the spirit with a demon's guile. Here lies the danger, lurks the full deceit,— Pretension, high as heaven's meridian truth, Performance, low as hell's absorbing lie! Religion thus, with suicidal hand Herself destroys; and into death transmutes A living zeal, which, else, for God and souls Like inspiration might the world employ:— Dilates a precept, or a truth contracts, Can mould a doctrine, or a creed erect; And round salvation such a dimness cast That Christ is hidden, and the Church alone In sacramental mist at length adored. But yet, how stern, how lofty, how refined, Thy vast professions, Romanistic creed! Not Purity itself, is pure as Thou In strictness, and severity of aim. From the mix'd world, monastically free, Our spirit thou would'st fain entice; and cast Its powers in moulds of superhuman faith; And thus, from foul entanglements of flesh The mind deliver, till, to earthless heights Of dazzling purity at length arrived, That consummation of the church is reach'd,— Meekness and martyrdom, in one combined! The Devil is the parodist of God; And priestly colours are the paint employ'd To tinge his counterfeits of Truth divine With holy semblance; and that flaming zeal For saintliness, apostate Rome affects, For Him has wrought satanically well. Pollution's self on Purity's clear throne In veil'd enchantment thus hath ruled, and reign'd, Deceiving others, and itself deceived. The Roman myst'ry is a mask of lies, While yet thy countenance, celestial Truth! It borrows; Mercy is the mild pretence, Justice her theme, and love for God the law, And zeal for Christ the Church's ardent soul That makes Her all that miracle she is!— Satan himself can thus religious seem, And poison Virtue with her very smile. Gospel and Grace in this dread system die, And Love and Light to cruel darkness turn, Shade upon shade, impenetrably deep, Investing Godhead with a vile array Of terrors, forged by sacerdotal guile, And summon'd forth as guilt, or gain demands. Where is The Father, in that fiction dread, That ghastly Something, for a God believed, Which Popery to the harrow'd Mind presents? Or, when the ague of a guilty heart Rages in secret, what paternal voice From God in Christ subdues it into tears? Then, not direct through Son and Spirit looks A soul repentant, from the pleading eye Of faith, on God reveal'd; but damning frowns, Blacker than Sinai's legal night of death To daunt the sinner, are at once evoked, Hiding the cross with intercepting gloom: Infinite Cruelty thus God becomes; His throne all blackness, and His heart begirt With stern-eyed Saints, who awe the spirit down Till first their mediatorship is moved, And God, persuaded by their prayer, relents! As if by impulse an Almighty moved, Nor in Himself His own great motive was. IV.—Sacramental God. But, see the climax of corrupted truth, An Incarnation, parodied by priests! Robed for a melodrame of mutter'd spells Lo, where the sacerdotal Juggler stands, Beneath whose touch the sacramental Host To Body, Blood, Divinity, and Soul Itself transforms, created into Christ! Emmanuel there, consummate and complete, Again must bleed, in Calvary revived! Oh, horrible, and heartless mock of all Of God in glory, or of man in grace, That He, whose Person is the Sum and Soul Of what in time Eternity shall act High o'er the senses, or mere reason's grasp,— Is now in sacramental bread contain'd While the blest wafer turns embodied God. And Thou, O Spirit! who alone canst rule The hearts where pantheistic darkness reigns, Or carnal gods, by dreaming passion shaped, Debauch the conscience till its light goes out, With what an aping Liturgy of lies Hath Romish parody presumed to mock The might, and glory of Thy work august! And dared, for living waters freshly drawn From the deep fountains of eternity And truth, Herself to substitute, and lift Her canons vile to revelation's throne. When thus the life-blood of religion's drain'd By this fell vampire, what for man is left But the mere carcass of a ritual show, A mindless worship, meaningless as false, Where man is God, and God to man transform'd? Thou dread Almighty! may we dare repeat With deep-toned echo, that mysterious Cry Apocalyptic martyrs lift above, And chant, “How long shall Grace Eternal be By juggling Rome dishonour'd, and traduced? How long shall falsehood wear the saintly dress Of truth celestial, while the Cross is veil'd, And He, whose merit is creation's shield, The church's light, and providence's law, High o'er His Throne, behold anointed dust And sainted villains, canonised and cowl'd, Ascend beyond Him, in their plea for grace!” 'Tis thus, the laurels from the brow of Christ Are taken, and around the head enwreathed Of Antichrist, for twice six hundred years,— That aping monster, who travesties God And in the glory of his darkness seems A mimic Satan, on Messiah's throne! V.—Moral Root. But, whence this power, which paralyses men To dull machines, for priestly hands to work, That from the Cross all crucifixion takes, And shuts the fountain in Emmanuel's side, Whence gush'd atonement for the World's great sin, Till Christ with closèd wounds remains, Shorn of those beams, which round His ransom play, And form a Merit fit for man to plead, Ample as Justice, Law, and God require? Whence the dread magic, which so mocks the world, Soothing pale conscience with Iscariot's kiss? Look in thy heart! there, reader! there it lies. As fits the die within the forming mould So false religion for thy heart is framed. Thy fountains, Nature! are the fatal spring Whence Popery all her canker'd life-blood drains, And drains for ever—for they ever flow! A moral cast from our corrupted soul Designing Rome hath taken; and contrived A feign'd religion, that, with fitting art, Infernally for each expression finds Some flatt'ring counterpart, or creed, or charm. 'Tis Man's religion from the root of sin, By passion foster'd, and by pride increased, Deep-grounded, in the under-soil intense Where guilty nature feels the goading pang, As conscience prompts, or keen compunction wakes. Hence, creeds are moulded; hence, all gods are made; While reason, bribed to superstition, bows, As sin and penance take relieving turns; Till man himself his own atonement dreams, And draws salvation out of sighs, and tears. And thus, not Mind, whate'er its lofty range Along the pathless Infinite of thought, A shielding bulwark round the man can raise, Safely to keep one Romish error out. For oft, religion is but God disguised; And when its nature from the name is torn Mere sounds and shades for sense and substance act; And cheated man a human mock adores. But God is love, by his Own love inspired, As seen the sun, by His own ray reveal'd. Then, vain those pæans which we loudly ring, As though the great millennium of the mind Were coming; or, a mental noon began, Too searching for the Man of Sin to face. Philosophy the sting of Death renews And back the vict'ry to the grave restores. Whatever prospect soaring mind attain No good it masters, till in God it rest, Where peace and pardon, law and love combine, And Christ and conscience can together dwell. And why? because some creed embrace we must; From heaven or hell religion must be drawn. For deep within, prognostications lurk Of tongueless dread; and boding terrors strike Their hidden chill; and throbs immortal stir, Like pulses of eternity, our souls; While moods are felt, when flames of wrath to come Prelude damnation, such as Guilt foretells, Till the grave opens through the banquet's glare And time's last thunders their rehearsal ring. Though sin confront it, yet will Conscience speak, Till sear'd, and branded into senseless nought. Shrined in the centre of our being, dwells That voiceless Umpire, on his moral throne Erect, and pure; whose archetype is God, In the stern radiance of severest law Reflected there, for legislative might. Here, Right and Wrong their true award receive; And Past and Present for acquittal stand, Or, condemnation from the bar receive; Here Man, the ruin, in his ashes keeps Some righteous embers, which a priest can rake, Or quench, or quicken, as the crisis needs. When darkly flatter'd, and when deeply read, Our hearts become but platforms, where a Priest Can play the drama of his Church, at will, And shift the scenes with most consummate guile. Some charm which echoes our exacting taste, Some lust respondent to the varied will, Some lie, to oscillate with pleasing sway And skill'd vibration, as the mood requires, Some gulling fiend to take angelic form, And o'er the pathway which to hell conducts Weave a rich carpet of seductive woof,— Let these be organised, or well applied, And man's religion in their magic proves How wondrously such adaptation works! Garb'd in a shroud of theologic guise Behold the Arch-fiend, with undreaded power His priesthood guiding; and, with ritual spells To sooth or sadden, flatter, charm or chain All which in Man of dust or devil acts, Gild moral ruin with redemption's smile! Thus, like a puppet, many-wired and weak, Our handled nature to each sacred pull Of Popery moves, with most responsive play. Art thou a Student, from the pristine wells Of learning, pleased and proud with classic thirst To drink rich draughts of undiluted Mind? Or, is thine ear by intellectual taste To harmonies of ancient thought attuned? See! the hoar'd Fathers in their hallow'd shrines, And pale Philosophy, in pensive state, Ready to bathe thee in some mental calm, And soothe thy terrors with ascetic trance. Or, (to the chariot of the senses chain'd) Do glare and grandeur, and attractive sheens, And Pomps, and Festivals, and painted Lies With false and fatal eloquence, appeal To the base passion of thine earthly will? Lo! the drunk Sense with reasonless delight May find a Ball-room spiritually gay, A ritual opera, by Rome arranged, Where the blood dances, where emotion reels While soft damnation, musical and sweet, Charms faith to feeling, and each feeling, blind! VI.—Religious Instinct. But, most to that religiously-depraved Self-righteous dream of ever-prompting Pride,— From earth to heaven to win or work its way, Adapting Popery, with mimetic art Her necromance of ritual pomp applies. A finite Self to infinite transform'd, Some Trentine god by moral fiction shaped, Is all that Passion's creed impure desires; And lo! in Rome the heart's vile canons meet Their very echo! grace and sin conjoin'd, An outward form for inner-life prepared, A dead religion where no God remains,— Here is thy Charm, thou sorceress of souls! Self-gain'd salvation forms thy secret force: Hence liturgies, to please corruption plann'd; Hence creeds, to flatter hope, or bribe a fear, And all the pantomime of bows, and beads. Thus perfect in pure falsity, Thou seem'st By the Great Liar of the world inspired, To set the Adam of the sensual mind In motion; feeling, so that nothing's felt, And working, so that nothing's truly wrought As Law proclaims, or holy love demands. Yet, nature, pleased with self-atonement, dares Blindly to merit what mere Grace bestows, And parts with all things, sin alone except! And thus, machines, by blind devotion turn'd For rites external, Rome's deluded slaves Become; automatons for priestly guile, Moving, or motionless, as that inspires; For, each false yearning of self-righteous will In Popery some pleasing vent can find. Devout fanatics, passionately wed To forms, where sense o'er spirit domineers, May there a sanctimonious refuge gain, From seeming prayer, to suit a prayerless heart, Down to the beads dull Superstition counts. Rome loves the Crucifix, but hates the Cross! And thus, whatever gull'd Emotion longs Upon her shrine of selfishness to lay, Her human gospel cunningly applies; Cheating the soul with skeletons of truth. No taste, but here a subtle pleasure finds; No sentiment, but what some echo meets; Nor fancy, which no fellowship can find. There, Painting, with its poetry of hues, And Music, with its poetry of sound, And temples, with their poetry of stone, All, all compose a theologic cheat That charms the spirit from its saviour-God. VII.—Sorcery. But thou! Imagination's martyr'd fool, Whose faith is fancy, in religion's dress, Whose shining virtues are but gilded vice Seen by the Bible's heart-exploring beam, For thee the cup of Antichrist is drugg'd With rapt intoxication's master-spells! Anthems, which seem to roll from Angel-harps, And silver chants, that Seraphim might sing; Paintings, where Beauty's virgin grace Divinely-mortal, exquisitely smiles; And sights superb, processions' vast array, Or cloisters pale, where Pensiveness may roam, Or perfumed incense, with its spiral clouds Floating to heaven, before the vested priests, Whose robes with sacramental meaning wave; All these, with Churches, where religion stamps The very stones with symbolising force, And painted windows, by their colours, preach Sermons which strike imagination dumb, Or, melt it in soft martyrdom of sighs,— Here is the weaving of those spells which bind Millions to darkness, in the chains of Rome! Whose mock religion The Almighty veils, And each fine essence out of saving truth Evaporates, in Forms which stifle faith, And from the heart its vital heaven exclude: For, what is holiness but heaven below? Or heaven itself, but holiness above? But, in some crisis of mysterious gloom When frowns almighty round the heart of guilt Darker than death-shades, dismal as profound, Hover and hang, the buried past revives Till dead Hours quicken in their secret graves, The Infinite a voicely fear becomes, And all of God to all in man appeals For vengeance! Horeb is on fire again, In thunder preaching its horrific curse. Now, seems a Sinai in the soul of man! Erected there by that instinctive law Which Nature's creed must canonize, and own: And oft, beneath its altitudes of gloom Pale terrors, and alarm'd compunctions fall, By strong enforcement, at its awful base; Till the bow'd spirit trembles into tears, While thunder-peals of God-proclaiming truth Preach to our guilt th' uncompromising Law Which conscience echoes with responsive groan. Then doubts, which make a Golgotha of mind, Madden the sinner with a fest'ring sway: The wind was sown,—the whirlwind hence is reap'd; The seed was darkness—and the fruit is death! And where, now pleasure's silken trance is o'er And fear'd eternity with curses rings, Shall the torn spirit some true refuge find? Oh, fell imposture! priestly Fiction comes; And all its juggl'ry of cheating lies, Indulgence vain, and penances most vile Which keep the sinner from the saving Cross, Again renews; the soul with opium drugs; Infernal laud'num blinded Conscience drinks, Till thus, from terror into torpor soothed, Her sunken witness in stagnation dies; And the torn Heart, by self-atonement heal'd, Back to its smiles of sinful peace returns To drink from pleasure draughts of death once more, Like a mad infant to its mother's breast, Though pale, and poison'd by some murd'rous hand. Here is thy venom, here thy spring of strength, Thou master-spell of Satan's master-piece! With all the finish of a fiend contrived To soothe the conscience, when a rack begins; To keep the penance and a priest in play; To hold the sinner, but let loose the sin, And by Confession to absorb the Cross. Thus, papal lies to nature's roots descend; They fix, they fasten in the moral soil Their foul adjustment. Man is papal born, And false religion must be papal too; And his exacting nature nicely fit In heart, in conscience, and uncertain will. For sin, when loved, for punishment, when fear'd, Consummate Rome hath thus for both prepared A recipé, that 'tween the two can act: A sop for Conscience—when it pleads with dread, And sin for Passion—when that dread is o'er: And thus, beneath the burning eye of Heaven, No parody of truth like this, deceives; No spell, by genius of satanic might Forged in the secrecy of mystic lies, No miracle of dread imposture, works Perdition with so masterly success As when God's will, travestied and transform'd, To Man becomes religion; and from heaven Beguiles him, while it seems to guide him There. INSPIRATION OF THE IDEAL. 'Tween two eternities each hour is born Of present Being; in the midst, our mind, (Through some deep sense of undevelop'd power, Haunted for ever by the Unattain'd) Fevers, and frets with intellectual thirst For more of Perfect, Beautiful, or Pure, For more of Truth, in majesty and might Than ever rises on the reaching sense, Or, seems embodied in the shape of Things. The Infinite we love, and half adore; Our heaven of feeling seeks a heaven of fact,— An outward Image, whose responsive mould May body forth Imagination's dream. And hence, enthroned in some ethereal calm, Conceptive Genius from creation draws Types of vast truth, and symbols of the soul, To aid Perception, when its shaping power Would vision out a universe of Love, And Ideality in life reveal. But if, beyond what Nature's world supplies A yearning soul for moral beauty thirsts, Creative Thought, by combination frames From all which heroes of the heart have felt, Or martyrs of the sleepless mind portray'd, Or dreamt in prison-gloom, or palace-smiles, A model of true consummated Man! And, noble is such discontent of soul Which leads to Virtue's elevating path; The mind unprisons; or, from chaining Sense, That coarsely to the common life of things Would bind us down in drudgery and death, To freedom and infinitude allures The man within. And hence, all dreamings high And holy; hence, imagination's flight; And aspirations, fetterless and pure. For, in this orbit of mysterious Life The central immortality is Man; And, greater far than all the greatness seen One viewless Thought of his observing Mind! Since what the apprehending sense beholds Forms but a veil, through which are dimly view'd Deep intimations of diviner Things, And preludes faint of far profounder Truth And Beauty, yet by God to be unveil'd. 'Tis thus, the poetry of heart begins, The painter's longing, and the sculptor's love, Which purify from sensual dross and guile Our inner-life, with sacramental force; Hence, Homer drew; and solemn Milton drank The inspirations of a deathless song. In beautiful transcendencies of thought From earthly matter into heavenly forms They soar'd, for ever; and, by shaping dreams, Imaged a life above the life they felt And breathed the immortality they sung. 'Tis thus, by passion for the Infinite, And glorious longings for some Perfect Good, The heart's millennium, in all ages, acts: Hence Liberty her laurell'd hero frames, Martyr, and saint, and sage their stamp receive, Religion half her purity obtains, And the bright paradise of Morals blooms. Thus Luther, in his lone and lofty zeal Impetuous, bold, and ardent as sublime, With feelings vivid like the soul they fired, Who led the exodus of man and mind From the vile Egypt of enslaving Rome To Canaan's borders, in the world of truth,— E'en like a prophet, o'er predestined scenes Above the cold, the actual, and the coarse Mounted aloft; and sleeplessly pursued Through tears and torture, outrage, grief, and wrong, Through storm and cloud, convulsion and contempt, That great Exemplar which his mind conceived. Beauty and Brightness their ideal thrones Erected in him; while their magic spell Temper'd his heart for each ethereal type. And so, by Pre-conception's purest charm Master'd and moulded, his frail being grew; He lived the Poetry which others thought; And from that hour when friendly capture threw A shroud of safety round his perill'd head Where the lone castle of Altenstein frown'd, To that famed crisis, when from cell and chain Heaven's cloister'd Principles came forth to breathe, Pale from the prison of a thousand years, His passion for the Perfect and the Pure Nerved him for wonders! Like that mystic Voice, Which often to the soul of seers reveal'd Visions of Godhead, vocal and distinct, Heaven-ward, for plans archangels might have cheer'd, Pure Inspiration seem'd to guide him on. Gigantic efforts, flush'd with sacred zeal, And high endeavours, honourably vast, Ardours intense, with flames of moral ire, A mental freedom, or that tameless force Which grappled ever with imagined Fiends,— All were expressions of one master-wish; The indications of a Soul, inspired To be the great Apostle of mankind In deeds of glory, for a cause divine. The sigh of Nature with herself to blend And bind, in one fond brotherhood of faith, The feelings and the family of Man; A New Jerusalem on earth to hail; A Church redeem'd to apostolic mould; A reigning Jesus, a rejoicing World,— To such bright centres of consummate hope Did Luther, with ideal passion, tend; These made the goal to which he onward press'd, The lofty mark, at which his virtue aim'd; And from the level of a monk's low range Lifted on high his ever-loving heart, And bade him, in a sunless age, to shine A moral saviour o'er eclipsed mankind. MAMMON AND MATERIALISM. Oh, for a Luther to inspire us now! Th' awaking magic of some mind God-taught To charm the sensual from the Nation's soul; Our passions dark, our appetites of dust To brighten, or to banish; till the love Of whatsoe'er is lefty, and divine, Of whatsoe'er is glorious, and august, The throne of public Taste may re-ascend, Give life to Genius, and a law to thought, And for the Beautiful true homage gain. Woe to the Land! whose days are evil now: Venality in vulgar glory reigns; Profit and Loss intense inspirers are; The Arts are pining in neglected gloom, Sculpture is dead, and Poetry in tears; And Science mostly for the palate reigns! Utility, a social god becomes, And Britain but as Dives, longs to live In pomp and purple, and in sumptuous joy. The universe for comfort seems arranged; The world,—a warehouse for convenience plann'd! And that Creation, which to faith appears An outer-court to God's more secret shrine, Is made a temple, where the Senses may Adore the Useful, with vile worship now. Alas! for England when her god is gold, And nought believed but what coarse passions love; When all of spirit, found in tasteful lore, In effort noble, or sublime in aim, A mock becomes, till principle expires, And base Expediency's polluted breath Falls, like a mildew, over minds and men. Romance is faded; sentiment extinct; All the fine chivalries of ancient Faith Are laugh'd away, as meaningless, or vain: While Dulness prospers in her leaden smiles, And mediocrity, with damping weight, Each nobler faculty and sacred power Darkens, at last, to intellectual death, And leaves to Manhood little but a name. Oh, for a spirit of reviving truth, A resurrection from the grave of Mind! That soon the harmonies of olden thought, Like buried music, from the past may rise In solemn cadence, and our souls becalm. Let Finite in the Infinite be merged; Let Fancy dream, Imagination dare, And Effort triumph in heroic forms Till Art and Genius glorify the world, And Science from her dreams of sensual bliss Turn to the Soul, and there, with rev'rent gaze, Deep within deep those springs of Nature trace, Where most the unapparent Spirit works, And awful Conscience from her secret throne Each lawless movement of the soul condemns; Or like an Oracle is ever found Approving virtue, and proclaiming heaven. COVENANT OF HEARTS. Bound in the links of that ethereal Chain Which upward, from the insect's tiny pulse On earth that throbs, to yonder wheeling orbs Enormous, its unbroken coil extends, Are all things by the Hand almighty held. And thus, what chance to vulgar sense appears, Is veil'd causation, and confirm'd decree. Nature herself, through each organic change And form, or function, is but Will supreme, In might, or beauty, marching to result Predestined. Not an atom is consumed; No leaf can vibrate, not a billow laugh, Nor wild breeze flutter on its fairy wing, But God o'errules it, with control as nice As that which belts the planets with a zone Of harmony, and binds the stars with law. And though mere chaos, to an eye immersed In sensual darkness, Life's perturbèd scene Must ever be, not thus to them who scan The world's confusion by celestial light From scripture beaming, does mysterious time Appear. For then, disorder is but plan Divinely-working, by arranged degrees Upward and onward into truth evolved Through the long maze of labyrinthine wills, Or human actions. Kings, and slaves, and priests; Erected monarchies, or crumbled thrones; The shout of warriors, or an infant's wail; In life, in faith, in conduct, or in creed Whate'er be witness'd, God behind the scene From His high watch-tower of incessant sway Governs, and guides the blended Whole of man. Never the Eye omniscient drops its lid, Or slumbers: whether Virtue's godlike brow Be laurell'd, and the Church's heart exult; Or dark temptation, like a Demon come, Harness the soul, and lash Desire along To ruin,—in that change, no change exists. For in the freedom of the foulest will Venting itself in vanity, or vice; Or in the soarings of a strong-wing'd faith That heavenward mounts, and leaves low earth behind, Around them moves One all-inclusive Will Which, leaving man responsible and free, For God retains supremacy and law. And none, whose souls, by sacred fear made wise, The lesson of their weakness well have learn'd; Or rightly weigh'd, how much from ties of love And charms of social power the moral frame Impression gathers,—dare to Chance ascribe A covenant of Hearts, when struck between Two in the faith, accordant and conjoin'd. Pure Love our moral gravitation makes; At once the motion, and the rest of man: But when, and where, and how electric chains Are closely fasten'd into Friendship's heart, Should make us ponder; since for bane, or bliss, Over man's conscious destiny they cast A character Eternity will not efface! Since Love is plastic; and by secret charm Shapes to resemblance with its moral self Our yielded bosom; and the yearning heart Thus takes the likeness of each thing it loves,— E'en as some insect from the herb derives A hue responsive to the food it eats. Hence, only virtue forms a solid base Rooted, and grounded in the heart of truth, Where friendship's high and holy structure stands Bedeck'd, and order'd, by approving Heaven. Two Finites can no lasting friendship make; Between them both an Infinite must stand, And He is God! Without Him, all is mock; The paint and pageant of a soul's outside By fancy colour'd, or by feeling tinged; But, wanting holiness, that All it needs Which crowns a friendship with undying charm. Fair Amity! when thus, indeed, the fruit Of sacred principle, by love inspired, Thy bloom is fragrant of yon world of bliss Ethereal, and with fadeless beauty rife. And such, when Luther and Melancthon's heart In oneness holy blended their deep powers, Wert thou; a friendship from the Cross which sprang In the green fulness of their common faith. And, in the archives of the past, how few The feelings, that more lovingly have twined A wreath of nature round the brow of grace, Than those, which from the young and verdant breast Of their twin Manhood, did together rise! DISTINCT BUT UNDIVIDED. Distinct in tone, yet undivided, both Their hearts in melody combined, and met. But if in nature poesy would find Their fancied echo, hark! the torrent's fall In liquid thunder foaming loud and fierce, From crag to crag precipitous, and bold,— And there, is Luther; while, along the banks Tree-shaded, list, yon low and quiet stream, And mark! the mild Melancthon. Each to each A grace of contrast, and the charm which glows Round minds which vary while the hearts embrace, Imparted: both in one vast work converged; And oh! what hours of evangelic peace, What hymns of soul, what praises blent with prayers, What feelings high amid the haunted woods Of Wittemberg, were oft by each enjoy'd! And in the lassitude of lofty cares When, crush'd beneath his adamantine wrongs, The soul of Luther lay in bleeding gloom, How the calm sunshine of Melancthon's face Around him shed some heart-restoring smile! But o'er Thy page, Eternal Wisdom! most Did their high friendship in communion blend; As truth on truth, from out the classic grave Of language, where dead meanings were entomb'd, Started to life in Luther's noble tongue Till Fatherland its own free bible hail'd, And God in German to his country spake. Thus, day by day, that Book of Heaven became A sabbath-port from earth's tempestuous cares, Which raged and roll'd around them: scene and time And circumstance, those mast'ring three in one That make, or mar the All mere worldlings dream, To them were shadows, which the radiant Word Dazzled to nought, as clouds in sunbeams die. The monarch's palace, or the monk's low cell, Or chamber dim, from out whose frescoed walls In massy framework look'd the pictured Dead Who live in hues immortal,—'twas alike To men, who on this world, were in the next, By faith or feeling ever wafted there. Then, what are base alliances, miscall'd By friendship's name, but artificial modes, Or satires on the sacredness and sense Of this high virtue?—mere enamell'd lies! Too often are they but a painted show Of pleased Hypocrisy, whose silken ties Are light as gossamer, before the storm Severe affliction round our lot may bring. Convenience; lucre; folly, pride, or gain; A ride, a dinner, or a small request; Or sad communion in the common sin By passion cherish'd—there, mock friendships reach A zenith, and their noblest zeal expires. But when, alas! unbodied, and unveil'd Of earth's false trappings, in the world of souls These gay companions of a feast and song Meet in stern truth, unmantled to the core, Hideously naked, to the very heart Discover'd,—how each mask of Self will drop! And many a cheek, by radiant kindness clothed, Blacken with hate, with horror, or revenge Infernal: friendship now is ruin found; And soft-mouth'd men, who seem'd, in time, so dear, Will each to each satanical appear And loathe, like fiends, their lost eternity! But, cast your friendship into chaster mould; Let genius, learning, or congenial taste, Or fellowship like what the Muses love, Refined as Lælius felt, or Scipio found; Or, let Parnassus sing how poets loved, Whose lives and verses did together run And softly blend, like interwoven streams, E'en at the best, such earth-born magic dies Soon as dark shadows of the grave begin To pall the Present, and its passing joys. Then, all their sweetness and their strength depart! Bred from the world, they, with the world, recede; Friendship and flesh, together in one tomb They perish; for, each lack'd that saving life Which makes immortal what we cherish here. CHRISTIAN FRIENDSHIP. But there is friendship pure as angels love; Which trust, and truth, and tenderness create When two fond Hearts with sacred force embrace, By union deep, unworldly, and divine. Then friendship, like a school for mind becomes, Where act to habit may itself mature; And Self, denied in little things, advance To show denial, which a world may bless And all the Churches with due plaudit hail. Here, faith with friendship can indeed concur; Beyond mere temper, and accordant tones; While reign those Principles whose charm outwears Sickness and sorrow, death, or cold neglect, With all the jarring dissonance which tries The force of feeling, in its wisest hour. But, whence are these, save from th' Almighty drawn, And, like Himself, unchangeably sublime! Here is a friendship, perfect, calm, sincere, Above mutation, as beyond decay; A friendship, Lord! whose archetype is Thine; For, when on earth, Thy mortal life assumed Manhood, with each consummate trait adorn'd; And human Feeling may exult to view Laid on thy breast the much beloved St. John! Oh! for a Friendship which outlives the sun, To last, when time hath faded, and when Flesh With all its burden, is a baseless dream. It drops a balsam in the wounded breast, Soothes the torn mind, and soul-dejection heals; 'Tis heart to sympathy and hand to love, Can charm the wisest, or the feeblest worth Uphold, and makes the poorest rich indeed. Man forms the foe, but God alone the friend, If friend he is, with truthful love endow'd, And graced with those prerogatives of mind Religion sanctions. Then, what kindred bliss, What sweet affinities of thought and taste! The Janus-temple of a jealous heart That shuts, or opens, as the door demands, Is here unwitness'd; all is frank display Which scorns pretence, and scatters each disguise By sun-clear verity, whose shining force Copes with all clouds of accident, or change, And ever beams on Friendship's cordial brow. Here is an amity our noblest wants Delight to welcome, as their true supply: With active force the intellect it feeds, The heart enlarges into loftier swell And, in the counterplay it gives and asks, Finds equal pleasure, when the echo sounds Sincere and manly. But affliction most The high-born friendship of heroic minds Illustrates: then the sacrifice of Self Devoted, prompt, impassion'd as sincere, By sorrow, substance, or by costly life, How godlike is it! how resembling Him The soul's Philanthropist, creation's Friend The world enriching, by Himself made poor! Friendship like this, the seal of God confirms, Who cast our nature into social mould And bade it seek for brotherly response, Or bosom-counterparts in bliss, or woe: And thus, whate'er his rank, or high renown, Man needs an echo, whose responsive charm Doubles himself, by feeling's prompt reply; To rich enjoyment adds a height'ning zest Untold; and when misfortune's east-wind blows Or cutting blasts of cold ingratitude Sweep the lorn bosom, by the world betray'd, Softer than dews from Hermon's sainted height The tones of Friendship, dropt in feeling's ear For comfort! Mine be thus some heaven-made friend, And I will clasp him, with the heart's embrace For ever! Morning with its radiant blush; Noon with its glory; Twilight with its trance; Or balmy Night, with all the stars awake In beauty walking o'er their midnight-round, How are they each, when friendship's echoing heart Throbs near our own, with added charm endow'd! Yea, all those homilies of love and might Appealing Nature to the pensive reads Down winding lanes, or paths of vernal bloom, Or rustic haunt where rambling Boyhood loves To stray, and linger,—how some tasteful friend Can, with ourselves, interpret all their tones In strains of poetry and inward peace, When souls are mingled, and Creation greets The hearts who love her. Nor does faith deny That, e'en in heaven ethereal friendships bring Their calm addition to celestial joy: For Truth is social, in the highest orb Of her dominion! God Himself is not alone, But in deep light, Tripersonally throned, In plural Godhead His perfection holds. UNION IN THE CROSS. So Martin Luther and Melancthon felt. For them, religion was no lifeless creed, But living virtue: faith and friendship blent Their pureness, and together nobly grew In the rich soil of their congenial breasts. And when we learn what this rare friendship did, How gratefully will Faith her God adore, Who so ordain'd, by councils plann'd above, That Men like these, in place and time should meet, Blend their brave hearts, and with united hands The fabric of the Reformation build In rising glory! Each that structure claim'd: And as some builder first in mind conceives The mansion, which external Art reveals, And models only from a type within, So, from His pattern of eternal thought, The Architect supreme His will expressed In that vast work the Reformation rear'd: And not a stone to form that fabric rose, Nor human workman there his building hand Devoted, but from God directly came Some guiding impulse. Glory, then, to Him! Who thus in hallow'd unity combined Two hearts distinct, as those twin Leaders bore That ransom'd Israel from Egyptian chains. Their's was a friendship, more than Nature forms, Fancy begets, or genial tastes preserve: The one, like thunder! arm'd by daring soul Breathing defiance with a lion-voice; Tempestuous often in that mental storm Which heaved his temper by o'erflowing wrath, With rage unbounded: but the other, mild And chasten'd, passionless and curb'd; A halcyon man of holiness and zeal Whose heart was quiet in its deepest hour. Or, Nature's imag'ry may thus depict Their true distinction, in her world of types; Intensely burning, like a tropic noon, In one the character of heart appears: The other, like a placid twilight-scene Bathed in serenity of softest dews, With stars down looking on the lovely whole. But yet, through many a shock unmoved they went, And stood united, when all else dissolved Around them. 'Twas The Cross, and that alone, Which so cemented with abounding grace Two Hearts, that else were utterly unlike. Here was a centre; round this changeless point Of God for glory, and of truth for Man, They met, they mingled, with harmonious love In concord perfect: but in tones of taste Agreed to differ with delightful ease. Contrast with them, like two magnetic poles, Their hearts attracted, and by secret love Each into each with soft concernment drew The closer; union their distinctness proved. But more than this, may grateful wonder see; For each to God's mysterious cause supplied Some fitting element, or power defined, Which, wanting, would have left His work unsafe, Or tott'ring. Thus, Melancthon's classic toils And tasteful culture nourish'd growing minds In progress; while, from Luther's boundless zeal There went a spirit of sublime attack That shook the Popedom, like a thunder-blast, Making it tremble down to falsehood's depths Of darkness. Thus, two Hands distinct they were, Each for his task appointed, and prepared, And both by Wisdom wielded from on high. FRIENDS IN HEAVEN. Their work is done, their deathless toil complete; And they are gather'd to that spirit-realm Where all things tend, as to their final home, Which are in time and consciousness reveal'd. But is that friendship, incorrupt and bright, Effulging from the radiant fount of Love Celestial, is it in yon heaven absorb'd, There swallow'd, in some Infinite of bliss Which now enfolds them? Are those ties of heart, Broken on earth, no more in heaven renew'd? If here below our fondest cravings prove Affections make the vowels of the mind, And, like a consonant, when left alone, Man without love seems unpronounced and mute, Will yearning Manhood in the skies be lone? Alas! if nothing save what Earth inspires By us be worshipp'd; then, as time concludes, And from eternity rise spectral Woes, And shapeless Horrors worse than guilt forebodes Hover in view, like flashes in the dark Our earth-born friendships will at once go out In blackness; better had they never been! But when two Hearts, heroic, brave, and pure Like Luther's and Melancthon's, nobly throb Through years of trial with responsive beat Unfalt'ring, can we think the upper-World Where men redeem'd the nearest circle form Of radiant worshippers, who round The Lamb Hymn golden numbers from their lyres of light For ever, can we think, that Souls like these, Will ever there in single glory chant That song, united which on earth they sung? No! from a heartless creed, for pagans fit, Our aspirations, dreams, and wingèd hopes At once recoil, unsocial heaven reject, And prove it pagan. If below the bonds Of sacred amity, by grace refined, 'Mid the dark waste of sin-degraded hours And all th' exacting selfishness which tires The bosom, yet themselves inviolate keep, How will such bonds, from imperfection freed, Gather new strength, and nobler charms enjoy In that blest Meeting-place of Minds above! Then shall each excellence, whose winning form Though varied, held the heart's accorded throne So firmly, shine with far intenser ray Than earth experienced. Thus, ascending Thought May cleave the firmament on wings of faith, Outsoar the stars, beyond the planets rise And leave creation far our flight behind, And there, within the heaven of heavens, behold Immortal Friends in one immortal home. From the same Fount of never-failing bliss Their blending spirits drink responsive joy Unspeakable: and there in God embower'd, What once made prayer, is now with praise enjoy'd; The past of earth in heaven a present forms And gives eternal Consciousness a theme For wonder, worship, and augmenting love. SUBLIME OF HISTORY. Nothing is little in this world of ours, Because, whate'er the dim-eyed sceptic dream, In nothing rarely can we act alone. Built like that fabled roof, whose finest parts Each into each by interwoven skill So exquisitely play, with poised effect, That touch but one, and lo! the fabric all Shakes into movement with recoiling shock,— So is our world by its Great Builder plann'd. Thus, the first glance which God's forbidden tree Drew from the eye of earth's frail Mother, forms With our last sin a fatal union now! No fact is isolate, no feeling lone; Entangled are we by perpetual lines Of moral net-work, infinite and fine, With magic influence all around us drawn, Which makes our conduct endless,—by the thrill And tone of feeling that it often strikes On the deep chord of ages, yet to come. Nothing is little, where a moral lurks: The last vibration of The Saviour's lip, Expiring, more of deity involved Than all the gorgeous universe contains. Though mean the wood, which then Messiah bore In bleeding glory, while the planted Cross Lifted Him up a sacrifice for sin, That sacramental Type a focus form'd Where the vast councils of Eternal Love Concenter'd all their wisdom and their wealth In action!—though a point in space, The Tree, From out it, as a salient centre, spring The hopes immortal of our world redeem'd. Not might of scene, not magnitude of space, Nor aught of majesty which Sense admires Or Time can value by his vulgar hours, To truth a character, or creed a strength Can give: for Principle a glory hath Beyond the limits of defining man; Enthroned in sempiternal light, it reigns The Alpha and The Omega of all In love stupendous, or in law severe. Thus round that moment, when the Saxon monk, Bold as some rock which breasts the main alone, Lifted his brow, and faced his gather'd foes, What centuries of undevelop'd truth And change, were secretly encounter'd, then! To eye of sense, mere Spectacle it look'd Of men and minds; or, where a rebel stood Undaunted: but, Another Form there was! Sightless amid the loud conclave, Who watch'd Each word that breathed, and master'd all which moved And thought, but was Himself unseen, unheard, And unimagined: lo! The Lord was there Supreme Director of that scene august, Where Luther triumph'd, and the Bible rear'd Its signal far above all thrones of earth, Untorn, untarnish'd, and untouch'd by man, The badge of faith and banner of our souls To be, beyond the rage of Earth, or Hell To baffle, or resist! And we, who gaze Back from the heights of purer worship now On that gone period, when th' imperial host Fierce in the hall of unforgotten Worms Mutter'd, and raged round Luther's dauntless form, May well that crisis of the World admire! And think, how from the crystal walls of heaven Spirits were gazing; or on balanced wing Hung o'er the chamber where the host convened, Viewless; and watch'd each mental shade which cross'd Thy features, while They drank with blissful ear Each tone majestic, thine unconquer'd mind By truth inspired, from scripture then awoke To perish never,—noble-hearted Monk Of Wittemberg! Nor let the mocker doubt, His yes, or no, the wheel of ages turn'd, And balanced Europe on a single breath; Since what he felt, the World is feeling still In heart eternized; Luther is alive By influence; and each living word of truth In Worms that sounded an immortal note, Intones our Churches with some cadence now. Oh! 'twas a scene, where hist'ry grows sublime And unsurpass'd; save when the fetter'd Paul Lifted his eyes of light and brow of truth Before Agrippa, till that prince of lust, Under the sway of his resistless voice And bold denouncement, quiver'd, like a tree Shook by the night-blast. From the hills of Rome The Vatican in vain its thunders roll'd; And thy huge palace, dark-wall'd Pleissenburg! Witness'd the brave defender, when he fell'd Those Anakims of intellectual might, The proud Goliaths of theology. But, now, at length, the very Man of Sin, And crown'd blasphemer who travesties Christ, Himself upon his Throne of lies shall start And shiver! “Pile for pile shall kindle now, Bull, Law, and Canons, and Clementines, all, Shall in one sacrifice of flame expire!” So spake the monk undaunted; and the blaze Redden'd, and rose beside yon eastern gate Of Wittemberg, above that papal mass Of fictions mould'ring, and impostures vile; While by a shout, which should for ever ring The heart of Europe with responsive tones, Applauding thousands that bright witness hail'd Whose keen reflection scorches Popedom, now. But, there He stands! in superhuman calm Concenter'd, and sublime. Around Him pomp And blaze imperial; haughty eyes, and words Whose tones breathe tyranny, in vain attempt The heaven-born quiet of his soul to move. Crown'd with the grace of everlasting truth A more than monarch among Kings he stood: And while without, an ever-deep'ning mass Of murm'ring thousands, on the windows watch'd The torchlight gleaming through the crimson'd glass Of that throng'd Hall, where Truth on trial was, Seldom on earth did ever sun go down, Or evening mantle o'er a grander scene. There Priests, and Barons, Counts and Dukes were met, Landgraves and Margraves, Earls, Electors, Knights, And Charles the Splendid, in the glowing pride Of princely youth, with Empires at his feet; And there—the miner's son, to match them all! With black robe belted round his manly waist Before that bar august he stood serene; By self-dominion reining down his soul. Melancthon wept; and Spalatinus gazed With breathless wonder on that wondrous Man! While mute and motionless, a grim array Of priests and monks, in combination dire, On Luther fasten'd their most blood-hound gaze Of bigotry; but not one rippling thought disturb'd The calm of heaven on his commanding face! Meek but majestic, simple and sublime In aspect, thus he braved the wrath of Rome With brow unshrinking; and with eyes that burn'd As if the spirit in each glance were sheath'd: And then, with voice which seem'd a soul in sound Made audible, he pled th' Almighty's cause In words almighty as the cause he pled, The Bible's! God's religion, not the Priest's By craft invented and for Lucre preach'd, For This, life limb and liberty he vow'd To sacrifice; though earth and hell might rage, Not Pope, nor Canon, Council nor Decree Would shake him! From the throne of that resolve By fiend, nor angel would his heart be hurl'd; Truth and his Conscience would together fight, The world 'gainst them—and they against the world! And then, with eyes which flash'd celestial fire, Full in the face of that assembly breath'd The fearless Monk those ever-famous words, “God help me! Here I stand alone; Amen!” MORAL RESULTS. And let all ages that “Amen” repeat, For it is worthy. Angels might the word Have welcomed, and th' Eternal arches rung An echo, as it roll'd from Luther's lip Solemn and deep, and with celestial might Impassion'd, since the Truth was then uplift, The Cross defended, and the Bible crown'd With vict'ry, when alone the monk of God Rallied his spirit into high resolve; And 'gainst the pope, the devil, and The world, Terror and time, and man's ingratitude, Fearless like Stephen, when that martyr stood, Firm as The Rock on which his faith was built. But not for this, will Persecution's fang Be blunted. Hark! beneath that vaulted roof Of Worms' cathedral, rise the chanted hymns Round the high Altar, while pale incense-clouds Float their soft fragrance through the aisles immense Of yon grey temple. There, at Charles's feet, Haughty, and with imperious rancour stung, Vile Alexander, on his knee, presents An Edict, dooming Faith and Luther's soul Together, under ban and blast to be Unceasing! “since the Monk was fiendish man, And all of heresies by heart conceived, By Satan loved, or damning falsehood dreamt, Hath Hell epitomised in him, at last!” Now drops the curtain on the Drama's view; Strangely and suddenly the scene's o'erveil'd By myst'ry; human actors are withdrawn: Inaudibly, along a darken'd stage Of wonders, moves the lone Almighty now, Himself evolving what His love decrees Inscrutable, by boasting man unshared. And e'en like Philip to Azotus rapt, Sightless, or lost, shall Luther for a while Appear; and safe in castled shade retire, That God alone may God's true champion be; Nor finite agency presume to claim For effort mortal, what the Hand Divine Shall consummate, in secresy unveil'd. Yes! Man shall vanish, that the Cause may rest Ark'd in the wisdom of Jehovah's will, Shelter'd and safe. But he, the hope of all, Far in the forest of Thuringa hid, E'en in that hour when most the dazzled scene Had hail'd him Hero of all prayer and praise, At once is banish'd! There shall Luther find A teaching solitude, where Faith may learn Meekly to suffer, and with flesh contend; Or, with some Angel of mysterious gloom Sternly to wrestle, till the break of day, The morning-twilight of a better mood Dawn on his mind, in radiant peace again. Down his own spirit he shall learn to gaze Through many a pangful grief, and sorrowing prayer; And, like his Lord, that mystic Ladder climb, Whose steps are suff'rings, but whose top in heaven Through glory reaches! Chasten'd thus, and calm'd, The Monk may gather up his soul for God And learn that faith he taught the world to love. SYMPATHIES OF NATURE. Thy beauty, Nature, hath a chorded spell Responsively for tones of feeling tuned, In moments deep of myst'ry and of mind. How often when the human world looks harsh And loveless; when no eye reflects the ray Of sorrow, beaming mildly from our own; When, darkly girdled by a zone of thought, Apart, and voiceless in our souls we move, Thy scenes of calm, thy solitudes profound, Like mute interpretations, seem to wear An outward mirror of the mood we feel! Then silence to the soul of thought appeals With more than language; thy maternal hush Upon the heart's strange fever falls, like dew. Sublime in thy sublimities we grow, And lose the littleness of earth and man Amid the vastness of those speaking Forms Of grace, and Grandeurs which Thy throne surround. Soon may the mind, by such entrancement, soar, And from the vileness of this vexing world A while set free, imbibe a nobler life, Holding dim converse with all shapes and hues Which body forth the Beautiful and Bright Within, or image forth the mood we feel. How eloquent the everlasting Hills Will oft appear! proclaiming with their peaks Majestic, Him whose fiat bade them stand Like monuments to Ages long no more: Or haply, in the heart's deep-thoughted hours Musing beside an immemorial Sea On some poetic shore, while wave on wave In hollow thunder lisps th' Almighty Name, How strangely does electric nature thrill Through forms of matter on the feeling mind! As though the elements, by love inspired, Interpret what our mental dream enjoys. And did not He, a beauteous symbol trace Between the gladness of his free-born soul And Nature's jubilee of sun and breeze, Heaven-guarded Luther! on his homeward track From that proud Diet, where a miner's son O'erawed the princes in their Hall of pride, And sent the arrows of resistless truth From God's own quiver through the heart of Rome? The crystal radiance of a vernal noon Around him deepen'd; hark! from forest-boughs Amid whose branches play'd the truant breeze, A quiring populace of birds resound Their tuneful joy; or, jubilant with life, Hymn wild hosannahs in Creation's ear; And, high o'er all, th' imperial Lord of day Eyes, like a parent, the rejoicing earth Beneath him basking, in a sleep of smiles. 'Twas thus, the countenance of Nature gave A beaming welcome, bright to Luther's heart. All elements his counterpart assumed; Meadow and tree intelligently wore An aspect, touch'd with some respondent hue To all within him. In that mood intense, His rapture was religion, while the mind Revell'd in radiance, like a lark which sings In sunshine, or a bee that hums in bloom. His joy was God experienced; and himself In heart, was living scripture, for the glow And gladness felt, were letters turn'd to life, In calm almighty through the bosom breathed. Hence his free soul by cheering grace inspired, Rose like a sail before the gallant wind; Though papal Bloodhounds for his spirit yell'd, A peace beyond disturbing fiends to mar, His conscience bosom'd: while the tempest raged, The swelling purpose of his mind, unmoved, Daunted each danger; as the perill'd bark Bounds into harbour through a battling sea And in calm sunshine dries its dripping sail. ASSOCIATIONS. Thus, safe is he, against whose life abhorr'd The dooming blast of Rome's relentless ire By fell edict was thunder'd; till at eve, As dew-drops thicken on Thuringa's boughs, And bird and breeze, on folded wing retired, Sit brooding, back to Eis'nach's boyish scene The Monk is wending. But as near he comes, His brave heart, softer than a willow bends Beneath the magic of remember'd days! For now, that local air again he breathes Where once, a foodless child of woe, he fought With iron hardship, and with cruel want, Bathing the crust reluctant Mercy gave With drops of anguish, from his harrow'd soul So often wrung. And now, in dreaming calm, His true heart echoes what reviving hours Are back restoring to all scenes, and spots, What once they took of character or tone, Of stern, or mild, of melanch'ly or strange; And so, most gently doth the man subside Down to the boy. For e'en as infant smiles Transmute the aged, till their features old With infantile expression learn to gleam In softest answer, may experienced mind, Touch'd by the spirit of life's early scene, Reply serenely to the haunting charm Of vernal fancies; or, of vanish'd hours Which waken round us, when maturer life Down the green windings of gone youth descends. Hence, all the poetry of peaceful thought (For men live poems in their purest hours, But write them, when the heart-song overflows) Made holy, lulls him into inward prayer. Oh, had they seen him in his softer mood Unmantled what a loving heart was there! Guileless, as that which throbb'd on Jesu's breast Those cowl'd automatons of monkish cells Whose frequent worship was but ritual wires In heartless, mindless, unimpassion'd play The man evolving, Luther then had taught By the fond gushes of this feeling hour, That true religion was a manful love, A Godward motion of believing soul Panting for heaven, but yet with earth at peace, And not ashamed Life's ruling spell to own. RETROSPECT. Thus might we, like the travell'd monk, proceed, And backward to the home of childhood wend, How much of elemental heart and mind Would then return, to whence of old it came, Helping to fashion the unfolding Man! For character is combination drawn From time and scene, from circumstance and spot. The brooks which prattled in gay Boyhood's ears, Or on whose wavelets sail'd our tiny boat; The haunted tree; the path we loved to wind, The cowslipp'd valley or the hawthorn-bloom; A widow's cottage, or some thatch'd abode Where dwelt the vet'ran of our native vale, Who smoothed our head, or tapp'd our rosy cheeks With ancient humour,—all, with shaping charm Secret but sure, that Being help to build Which Manhood in its moral structure shows. For, there is nothing which we feel, or see, Admire, or welcome, but a forming power From thence proceeds, and moulds the plastic mind. Sunrise and sea, and solemn-vested night When mute creation God's cathedral turns For Nature's worship; with all social things, The hand you grasp, the hearts your own selects, The sigh re-echo'd, or the teardrop shed Responsive,—none wield unavailing sway; But secretly some inward tone impart, Hereafter in your complex manhood felt Or found. And, like as our sepulchral dust Howe'er transmuted by organic change, Under the blast of Death's awaking trump Back to the Person, by attractive law Shall rally, and a perfect body form, So, may the structure of our moral frame, Completely, from such causes manifold, The after-finish of its Form educe. But now, from scenes where childhood's dark-wing'd years Had bleakly wafted his unfriended life Through many a storm, to Mora's rustic wild, Onward behold the dauntless trav'ller speed. In that calm village, where a lowly sire Drew the first breath, his genial soul partakes The deep o'erflowings of affection's tide, Tranquil as tender: placed amid kind hearts Which beat fond echoes to his faithful own, What peace he finds! what purified repose! Not his the bosom cold, or shut, or stern; Nor mock philanthropy, which makes a World Its giant fav'rite, while domestic chords Are unallow'd to vibrate through the breast, And distant love proves mere neglect at home! Fresh on his soul the dews of feeling lay, Lovely and bright, as youth's unwither'd prime Had witness'd; in the man remain'd the boy: And they who wonder'd, when the hall of Worms Erect and moveless saw the Hero stand, Might here have seen him with a graceful stoop Bend to the lowly; and with winning smile Attractive, clasp the humblest child who came, And all his glory into shade recall. Simplicity alone was greatness here; And, in the hush of this ancestral vale, High on the wings of meditative bliss, In psalms, and melodies of hymning joy Mounted his heart beyond the rising gloom Beneath him, o'er his earthly future spread. Like some gay bird, which oft at golden noon Soaring and singing, to the gates of Light Wings its loved way in ecstasy and song, Yet soon as earth's low atmosphere it tries Drops the glad plume, and songless grows again. FRIENDLY CAPTURE. But this calm Eden of domestic hours Is brief, as blest. Again, his forward course Through the green twilight of Thuringa's woods Behold the man of God in peace renew, Under the balmy flush of May inspired; Till lo! at length old Glisbach's hoary fane Glooms on the air; and, girt with feudal walls, Altenstein glimmers from its castled height Serene, but stern. But see! in golden calm The Day is gliding down the gorgeous west, Where the red Sun his farewell-pomp arrays; While round about him, as for royal sheen, Banners of crimson lustre wave, and wind, Till the far clouds, with sympathetic hues As in the blush of radiant sleep they lie, Mirror bright meanings, from his burning face Reflected. Soon the forest-boughs begin, In the tranced quiet of a sunset-hour To hush their waving; then, the languid breeze Drops its gay motion; and the insect-hum Low in the grass delights a pensive ear; While the glad wings of home-returning birds Flap on the air, with audible advance, Which bids you track them to their pine-built nest With eye pursuant. But, amid this peace Of nature, deep as if with conscious depth, Hark! tramp on tramp! with ringing hoofs that rend The air before them, while the riven trees Tremble, as if a sudden whirlwind tore Their tangled umbrage, horse and horsemen arm'd Plunge into view, in panoply complete, And mask'd: then, swift and silent, ere a thought Can think protection, Luther, from his steed Dismounted, by some mailèd horseman grasp'd And cloak'd, and on a charger rudely thrown, At once is captured, as by Magic chain'd! And in a second, hark, the sounding hoofs Ring the deep forest with their hollow clang; Then onward through its beechen wilds and woods Plunge the mask'd riders, with a trackless speed; And, Luther! where is now thy destined home? Who can forecast what God, or man, intends? Or, tell what dungeon, stake, or crushing wrong Awaits thee, when a day of brightest hope Ends in the shadow of so strange eclipse! But Night hath deepen'd; and her shrouding veil Garments the woods, which now with blacker gloom The mountain-heights of lone Thuringa fringe; And yet the Horsemen, with a voiceless flight Hurry their captive through untrodden paths Till the Moon rises, and her silv'ring gleam Pale on the fortress of the Wartburg sleeps, Which yonder dim and melancholy stands, Calm as the clear cold heavens which o'er it spread Their arch of silence. There the Horsemen pause, Wearied and worn; and, list! the bugle sounds A waking challenge in the warder's ear; Drawn are the bolts, and down the drawbridge falls; On iron hinges, ponderous and slow, Opens a gateway to the midnight-Troop; And mask'd and mail'd, around thee in yon court, High-wall'd and barricaded, there they stand, For, Luther, lo! thy Patmos greets thee now. NIGHT IN THE WARTBURG. Deep trance of Night! a mystic power is thine, Which sanctifies creation with a charm Beyond what day-beams in their brightest glow Can emanate, whatever scene they gild. But oh! if ever into heart of man The Midnight like a mute religion sent Her spirit, surely, when the captured monk Down the dim chambers of the Wartburg paced, Thy genius, then, in solemn glory reign'd! There, by his window-turret, lofty, bleak And lone, unharm'd in holy peace he mused, The past revolved, and o'er his future pray'd. But moments rise in this unfathom'd life Of ours, beyond revealing prose, or rhyme E'er to unveil; so charged with secret might, They into voiceless sentiment transform Our being; like a cloud, we seem to float In formless dreams, with visionary shapes Confounded; till at length, calm'd nature feels By truth replenish'd, and distinctive thoughts Melt from the heart, pathetic, soft, profound, Like tears of pity in a good man's eye. Then, all we have been, are, or hope to be, Blends in wild softness; and the soul o'er-sway'd Throbs with the spirit of unbreathèd prayer. All that we have been, yes! the night restores: Form after Form we loved, or knew, or fear'd, Moves o'er the platform of a summon'd past; While dead eyes open, and familiar smiles Fall on our hearts; or household-voices ring, Till the soul echoes with remember'd tones Sweeter than music, in its tranced excess. And all we are, oh! Night can this expound; And self to self beyond all preachers show In truthful plainness, making conscience start, As sin on sin, which cov'ring daylight hides, From the dim back-ground of our Being comes To awe conception. Then, the future's doom! Oh, how the spirit of a midnight-hush To That, significance and shape imparts, As depths of possibility untold Open beneath Imagination's eye, Fearful, and fathomless, and full of God! 'Tis then we soar ourselves beyond, and reach The skirts and shadows of a higher State Yet to be master'd. Or, may Thought presume Thus to imagine, that as embryo life Hath latent inlets ere the breath begins, And dormant senses undeveloped powers, So may our Spirit in the flesh perceive, Faintly and feebly, some prelusive state, Or, preconceptions of Hereafter feel Which antedate a nobler life to come? And did not Luther, at this dreaming hour, His great heart yield to more than words depict? Bathed in the ether of divinest calm As there he mused, and from yon window'd tower Greeted the heavens, with planets jewell'd bright? A holy calm adown the harrow'd depths Of his vex'd bosom, solemnly was breathed; While feelings, tinged with supernat'ral awe, But tender, round him cast their mingled spell. Like starry gleams, in evanescent play, Glances of truth upon his spirit dart But vanish, ere perceiving sense could grasp A bright suggestion for the soul to read. Worldless the hour, but how intense the scene! For never, since in Roman prison clank'd The fetter'd Paul his honourable chain, And haply, through his grated window watch'd The arch of midnight, hath a finer Soul Look'd o'er yon sky, than that which gazeth now! Mute as a cloud, the time-worn Castle stands Of Wartburg, through the glassy moonlight rear'd In outline black, colossal and abrupt; Beneath him, wrapt in motionless array, Thuringa's forest spreads a gloomy wild Soundless; and so becalm'd in dewy sleep That e'en the leaflet, when some quiv'ring air Throbs for a moment, like a lip in dreams It vibrates, but no vocal murmur makes. Creation, hush'd in her most holy trance, Sinks on the soul like one vast sentiment; From the high moon and melancholy stars Around her, to the stirless grass beneath, How mute is nature! how intensely fill'd With life, with meaning, and with sentient awe! As if the Earth were conscious that her God Commanded silence, and she felt it rise Deeper and deeper, from Creation's heart, And all things binding with religious spell. But now, the glory of this moonlit-scene Melts through his being, till each spirit-chord Thrills to the magic, with responsive tone. Lo! the large tear-drop on his eyelid hangs And quivers, like a half-unspoken prayer Which on the balance of expression moves. For God, and Truth, and Luther, now commune; And Midnight hearkens, as the monk adores The Christ Eternal, in His glory sphered High o'er yon heavens, beyond conception raised, And yet by soaring adoration reach'd Which climbs that region where His radiance dwells, And thrills the Saviour on His very throne! PATMOS. Sublime of privilege! to be alone, And hold communion with celestial Grace In the hush'd temple of a hallow'd mind, Where thought is worship, and Religion wants No liturgy, save what the heart inspires. In pensive solitude our God unveils Those charms almighty, which a sordid love Of this vex'd world is all too vain to prize; Then truth ascends our being's mental throne, To rule and regulate the life within; While round us shades of man's Hereafter steal Till awful conscience, with prophetic eye, Rehearses what the Judgment-Day will be To men, and angels. Now, from sense withdrawn, The pious Soul at length presumes to gaze Down her own deeps, and there a grandeur finds, A depth in depth unfathomably retired, Of consciousness, which makes her more sublime Than all the gorgeousness of glitt'ring worlds. A single mind the universe outweighs; A thought than worlds is more stupendous far; And yon proud stars, which populate the sky In dazzling multitudes, are less divine Than the pale forehead of some pensive man Beneath them watching, from whose lifted gaze Outshines divinity; whene'er he thinks! And this we learn, because in this we live, When from the perill'd life of passion freed Within ourselves we dare at last descend: There, truths unvoiced may thoughtful hearts perceive, And dread predictions, by no language shaped, Thrill through our conscience with majestic force And hint the Being men are doom'd to know. But, solitude a softer mood enjoys; The past revives; the tombs of time unlocks, And in the heart's sad resurrection calls The dead to life, the dear to love, again! For when this halcyon o'er the spirit broods, The chain of life, electrically touch'd, Link after link unwinds, and leads us back From manhood, with its false and fretting cares, To childhood, basking in maternal smiles. Soothed into softness, now the stern can weep; And shamed ambition from itself recoils To think how basely, on the World's false shrine The hopes and aims, which heaven alone can meet, Our life hath squander'd, with a fruitless zeal. Ye dreams of Virtue! oft in vice exhaled; Ye hopes of Greatness! oft in ruin sunk; Ye full-wing'd Energies! which cleaved your flight High o'er the vault of young Ambition's heaven, Reality, the stubborn, and the true, To airy nought, hath frown'd ye all away! Still, may we profitably mourn; and muse, When Memory o'er tombs of buried time Bends her pale brow, and placidly recals The spring-like radiance of exulting youth. For what, though blasting disappointment sear'd The buds of promise on our tree of Hope, And few have actualized the heart's fond dreams, Yet, contrast is our teacher: and we know The truth, by trial only as we live; And man who sins, by suff'ring must be saved, While God, through disappointment, makes him wise. Then hush'd for aye, let all rebellions be: But welcome, Solitude, however drear, And come, Reflection! with thy charms august, And Mem'ry! oft our deeper yearnings wake; Be to the husband, all the wife appear'd In the chaste beauty of her spousal morn; Be to the orphan, what the mother was When by her knee he knelt, a dimpled boy Lisping his little prayer; or, on her breast Pillow'd his head, as if the world were peace: Act all within, that life without has been, And from the grave, where dead and dear ones lie, People our homes with forms true hearts revere! SPIRITUAL LONELINESS. And not unlike, in moods of thought intense To this, was that experience, which the soul Of Luther gather'd, while for ten lone months By friendly capture in his Patmos hid. Here did he muse; and watch, or weep, or pray, Enter himself, and down the mind's abyss Take many a deep and undescribèd gaze; Till forms of terror, phantoms of despair, And dread emotions, meaningless, or vast, Throng'd into power, and haunted him like hell! Meet was the spot for high-wrought feeling's hour. Within were chambers, long, and large, and roof'd With fretted stone-work, dimly worn by years, Where the glad sunbeam caught a pensive tinge Paler than twilight; and the tread of feet Fell like a sound, which ought not there to be: While from their ancient walls the stern-brow'd Dead Look'd on the living, as with sad rebuke, Or solemn warning. From a window-niche The eye might witness hills of forest-wood In green confusion, stretching far away Into wild distance; while to Fancy's ear The pleasing anthem of perpetual birds Made the huge Forest with their concert thrill. And here, in myst'ry and in mournfulness, Shrined in the solitude of his own soul How much of Deity might Luther learn! Ascending oft the mountain-peaks of mind, The Alps of thought, far up the Godhead ranged, To talk with his Eternity to come. How like a poem must his life have read, Where fiction's self by fact had been surpass'd, When now, by retrospection's quiet gaze Unroll'd and re-perused! To boyhood's prime And young experience, when the miner's cot Roof'd his sad hours of struggle and of sin, Down the strange past, through all his soul endured, Dark conscience felt, or prescient fancy dream'd, Remembrance flew; and now, in castled pomp Behold him exiled! far from Rome's dread eye Which glared with hunger for his mangled form. And well might he, when thus the past renew'd, The present acted, and the future brought Prophetic influence into vivid play, Seem by intensity transform'd, and fired, Till Unrealities around him throng'd, And Phantoms, which derision loves to mock, Fever'd his life with supernat'ral force Till Matter's self a form of Mind assumed, And feeling suffer'd all which fancy shaped. REACTION. From vast excitement, to the voiceless depths Of this weird solitude at once transposed, Who wonders, that reaction like a curse Besieged him? or, with arid weight o'erhung The beatings of his brave and free-born heart? Till, in such blank and barren waste of things, He sank, and melted into mindless tears; Or sigh'd, as if the very soul was worn And weaken'd down to senselessness, and woe. Oh! there came moments, when a fiendish gloom A lurid darkness not of earth begot Enwrapt him, like a shrouding agony;— A stifled pain, a suffocating pang, A grief benumbing with torpedo-touch All the warm currents of his healthful blood, Till life itself one long compunction grew! Thus did he suffer: while the brain o'erboil'd With madness, and his soul was set on fire; And then, rebukes from some sarcastic Fiend Would ring around him with disdainful tone, To mock the little, and to make it less, Which He and Truth together did, and dared, When back recoil'd from their combined assault Popedom and Pope, with all their banded powers! Nor let the bond-slave of the senses ask, Why Luther, tempted in such gloom, believed That ghastly mockers, bodiless and black, On soundless wing and immaterial tread Inaudibly around him came; and cursed And grinn'd, in all the ghastliness of hell, To shake his spirit from that throne of trust,— The Word almighty! Yes, when rolling storms Yell'd in loud rage; or night-wing'd tempests burst, And howl'd along the wind-rock'd battlements Of Wartburg, oft did spectral Forms appear Shading the room with imag'ry of life And motion; mutt'ring Fiends his couch besieged, Till Luther shudder'd out his soul in prayer! But e'en by day, when black depression came And, like the nightmare of the mind, o'erhung All faith and reason, in one fell attack, No flaming death his Flesh could so appal As this dark anguish did the blood o'erpower; The pang, without the peace, of death was there! TOIL AND THOUGHT. But, like an eagle from his chain unloosed Darting aloft to his blue home of skies And sunshine, soon his panting soul escaped From this dread bondage into purer life. He pray'd, and open'd Heaven itself by prayer! Attracting downward some responsive grace, Or balm, which heal'd him like the hand of God. Or haply music, as the lyre of old Tuned into magic by the sweeping touch Of David, when he charm'd the fiend from Saul, Besoothed the spirit; till o'er all his frame A lulling softness exquisitely crept, And soul was cradled in the charm of sound. His exile, now, no barren rock became Where thought must wither into wintry blight; But rather, grew a bower of mental peace, An isle of calm amid the sea of life, A Patmos, where the harbour'd soul retired From earth's loud shock, to feel the hush of heaven. Soon, like a giant from his sleep refresh'd, Up rose the great Reformer! and awoke The drooping thousands, whose dejected hearts Pined for one accent of his cheering lips. But, how he wrought, and with what noble bursts And outbreaks high of eloquence, and truth, He pour'd his spirit over man, and mind, Omniscience only can on high explain; For, souls like Luther's multiply and make More change within, and character without, Than mere chronology to men unfolds. Down to the roots of conscience dived his words With daring energy, and drew to light Those hidden workings, and that dark unrest Which haunt our being: or, on guilt and gloom The thunderbolt of just rebuke he hurl'd, And through the provinces of mind career'd On bold excursion's theologic wing, And wafted light, where'er his wisdom came. But, in thy castle, Wartburg! chief o'er all The monuments which mind up-builded there, Let gratéful Rev'rence long that work admire, O'er which a Seraph's wings might shake with joy, By Luther, with colossal power achieved. There, was the Word Almighty, from the grave Of buried language, into breathing life Summon'd, in sainted glory to arise, And speak to souls, what souls could understand! Oh! to have seen him, in that toil august, Lifting to heaven his meditative eyes Radiant with wonder, as the words of Truth Eternal gave their hoary secrets up, While God's own language into Luther's pass'd With prompt transition; till, behold, the Voice Of Jesus out of classic fetters came And, like its Author, to the poor man preach'd. Noble, beyond nobility to match, Hero of heaven! was thine achievement here. To free the Bible, was thy God to throne Firm on the conscience of adoring man; And hence, by this supremacy divine To limit tyrants, should they dare profane That seat of awe, where none but Godhead rules. But, intervals there came of lovely calm, Mild as the languish of a summer-even Around the poet, by some dream entranced, When Nature, like a conscious Meaning, acts, And through cold matter preaches grace to mind. Then, student of the Spirit! walk with fear The halls of nature; nor, with pagan eye, The meanest of Her solitudes and shrines Inspect thou: ministries of mind are there, And more than mere philosophy forebodes Fills the fine atom which a step destroys. Angels and Spirits may unseen preside, And nature's beauty be a Seraph's work; Behind the Veil which meets our sensual view Myriads of Powers may ply their noiseless hands, And each live function of this breathing Earth, Serve but to type a Ministry unknown. And not ungenial to that high-toned mood When feeling soars, and poetry is born, In sun and silence Luther wander'd forth; Perusing earth, or reading air and sky As one great manuscript, where God had penn'd Some letter'd outlines of His secret Name. For, though creation felt the curse's fang, And beauty from the beautiful hath fled, And glory from the glorious,—still, the wreck Is haunted with magnificence and might, Making the universe a Temple seem, Whose priestess is the God-revealing Soul Of man, and worships Him in earth and sky, Or in the stars, whose bright pulsations throb Like thrills of glory trembling through the skies. And, deep the hour, delicious was the calm When Luther, in some dream, would oft accost The speaking loveliness of fruits and flowers Around him scatter'd, o'er the castled hill. To him they were with more than beauty touch'd, And seem'd like orphans of dead Paradise Which smiled upon him, with a mournful grace. Thus, hues and harmonies of Eden throng'd, In sweetest union, round his loneliness, While faith, by rapt imagination raised, In prayer for those millennial glories pined, Which God hath promised, and His poets sung, When spousal Earth her bridegroom-Lord shall greet Returning, on Creation's throne to reign, Till every atom of this world redeem'd Blooms in His breath, and sparkles by His smile. But, Nature hath her sad and silent moods, Her solemn counterparts to serious man. And oft at sunset, when pale Autumn sigh'd Like a lone Spirit, wailing through the woods Of Wartburg, Luther mourn'd 'mid falling leaves, And flowers dejected, till the dew-fall 'gan To glisten round him; and his boding mind Took from the season types of man within. And thus, at midnight, when the Moon commenced The inspiration of her pallid beam O'er plain and mountain, from his harrow'd sleep The exile rose; and, through the window-grate Of his high turret, o'er yon dew-white fields And cold earth, slumb'ring in the glassy air, Gazed mournfully, through many a sleepless hour; Or wander'd o'er the skies in prayer and praise, Till to his dream-wrapt eye those heavens appeared A scripture bright, whose oracles are stars Of promise, beaming with prophetic truth, And high intelligence for holy man. DARKNESS IN THE HOUR OF LIGHT. The saints of thoughts, the seraphim of mind, The sole archangels of our sinful world Who make, or magnify the page they fill With moral prowess, what colossal pangs Were theirs! and what fierce martyrdom they faced, In bringing forth those Promethéan fires Which lighten Centuries with their living ray! But, never yet hath Truth had monuments, Whose sculptured immortalities of praise Could half reveal, what lion Hearts have braved In the great agony of being great! For what, though history weave its laureate-words Around some trophy of consummate toil; Or chant the glory of those giant thoughts Which grasp'd all ages, with redeeming force; Result is praised, but not the process told, Nor the deep racking of those downcast-hours When darkness, like a fiendish nightmare, sat Heavy upon them; till the gasping soul Grew effortless, as if by doubt struck dumb; While truths, which once like inspiration nerved The heart for battle, e'en to blood and flame, Melt into nought, by spiritless eclipse. And, when have earth's high Benefactors felt That martyrdom, beyond all fires to make? Not when the clash and combat fiercely rang Around them, and the World its weapons drew To daunt their progress, or dispel their aims: For then, that eagle of unstooping mind, Young Energy! could lift itself for flight, And mounted bravely through the blackest cloud, Cleaving all tempest with unbaffled wing. Danger and death were talismanic sounds, Which from the heart drew forth a secret fire. Effort was theirs; and mastery sublime O'er scene and circumstance their faith evinced, Till lo! the perill'd cause in safety smiles, And History for its coronation waits. But in the gladness, and the glow immense, When hope's millennium seems at last to bloom; When the calm jubilee of conscience rings, And Principle its heaven-toned pæan chants For peaceful triumph, then, while good men pray, And great ones, in a hush of wonder, pause; If, in such hour of golden promise, all Fades into formless vanity, or vice, And fell Reverse a sudden ruin frown,— Alas! the Heroes of the heart are left Unpraised, unsoothed, unlaurell'd, and unsung, The rack of racks alone to face, and feel, When virtue's cause a suicide becomes And stabs itself to impotence, and shame! But, such the crisis, that with sudden might And sweeping darkness round tried Luther's soul Came, in the very noon of noble hopes, When the bright future cloudlessly began To open, and in peace and prayer to reign. Height after height victoriously was scaled Of priestly bulwarks, and papistic lies; The Bible, into living freedom loosed, From cot to palace circulated truth; The majesties of buried mind began, Clothed in the radiance of regen'rate power, The grave-clothes of the monk to throw away: While, chief o'er all, that Mammon of the priest, The aping Mass, where bleeding Love is mock'd, Was banish'd; and Emmanuel's truth began As Lord of conscience, from all hearts to hurl That crown'd Melchisedek, whom Rome anoints Both head and front of Christendom to be. When lo, at once the anarchy of change! And Luther, palsied as by dread alarm, Around him hears fanatic Madness yell, And the hot Até of excited hearts Through flame and fury to rebellion sweep. And now, the Pang! the concentrated pang, Which dire, and dark, expressionless and deep, Heaved in no sigh, and by no tear pourtray'd, Sank on his soul with adamantine crush. For all seem'd ruin, and revulsion here: While leagued Rebellion, with its brazen throat, Its blasting eye-glance, and its bloody mien, And mingled yells for murder raging loud, From the black forest of Thuringa rush'd; While He Himself an incarnation seem'd In principle of all perversion did, That Madness loved, or Murder long'd to do! The People cursed him,—for he cursed their cause, And call'd rebellion but the child of hell. The Princes cursed him,—for the yoke of Rome His arm had broken from the nation's mind. Bereft, in solitude of soul apart, A ruin among ruins, thus he stood With heart all bleeding, and with spirit bare, One living agony of gloom, and tears. And well might Luther, like his Master, feel Desertion, in that night of nights profound! For Heaven's own cause fanatically lay Trampled, and torn beneath a hoof of lies, When Munzer, and his host by hell inflamed, Shouted “The Spirit!” and to blood blasphemed Both God and Bible, with insanest breath. Each to himself a Holy Ghost became, And all his madness to th' Almighty gave! And He, who was on earth the living Type Of holy Order, and consummate Law, Both first of Subjects and the first of Kings, Upon the banners of Rebellion found His Cross a symbol of destruction made! E'en common feeling from the roots was torn; Till all affections, motherly and mild, Which form sweet nature's consecrated spring, Nile of the heart! whose undiscover'd source Deep in the bosom of the Godhead lies,— Were parch'd to nothing in that burning waste; When heroes mad, for demigods mistook, Mangled their thousands, by a hellish creed, And christen'd Murder with the name of Christ! “But fear thou not!” a Voice within him cries; “Forward! for I am with thee, man of God! On to the rescue of My truth! and fight With weapons all resistless, as divine!” And forward went He; with a burst of zeal Faith from her cloud of black dejection breaks, And Luther is himself, in soul, again! While hope, that rainbow of the weeping mind, The Iris out of tears by passion wove, Smiles through the sunshine of prophetic calm, And his heart palpitates with silent prayer. MENTAL RESURRECTION. True liberty, O God! Thy Spirit makes; For, the vast doctrine of redeeming Love Holds in itself the majesties of man. Freedom and faith our twin inspirers are, The healthful source from which pure greatness springs: All fine immunities of sense, and soul, All deeper actings of divinest thought, All morals, motives, aims, and bold designs, And aspirations for the Good unseen In man's free conscience find their perfect root. For liberty within, forms light without, And grace the spirit of salvation is. Whate'er of polity just freedom lauds, Whate'er of life domestic love reveres, Whate'er of mind heroic wisdom haunts, Or, in the temple of essential Truth, All which our adorations prove divine, From grace, in principle, directly flow. The Reformation thus the Mind redeem'd; The swathing bands which superstition cast Round the chain'd spirit, were at once dissolved; And, lo! a mental resurrection smiled: A golden dawn of intellectual day Already round the clear horizon glow'd, And faintly shined on Europe's rising heart. See Luther, and Melancthon, all inflamed Ardent as eagles, in their sunward flight, From truth to truth victoriously advance! Instead of Masses, mark the Holy Feast, The mystic Supper of Incarnate Love Dispensed with beauty, primitive and plain. The Visible its hallow'd claim advanced, And Ideality a form assumed; While the young Church her pristine features wore. Thus, rites external, for external sense, And truths internal, for internal soul, By fitness due the wants of nature met; Since, mere Abstractions angels may perceive, But men embodied must by Forms be led, And rites are reasons, when by God approved. Still, not o'er temple-rites alone was breathed That order Principle from Scripture draws; But through the heart, by reformation clear'd From papal mist, the common mind was touch'd, And the pure founts of intellect unseal'd From lofty plans see Education stoop To ply the humblest with appropriate skill; While cloister'd Learning, from her cells escaped, Comes to the peasant-home, the people's heart; Till mind is no monopoly for priests, And classic Thought in sacerdotal rust No more lies with'ring; but, at Luther's word, Walks through the world of feeling, and of faith; And ye, the symbols of our inner sense, Types of the Beautiful we cannot reach; Ye adumbrations of diviner Grace Than ever seen, when most Invention lifts Her glad Eureka! round enraptured souls, Ye Arts! which make imagination's heaven, By shape, or hue, or melody reveal'd, Soon from the sacred Reformation caught A new intensity of noblest power. For Music rose, seraphical, and pure, And revell'd in a paradise of sound, To hymn the Prince of glory, and of peace. And Painting, from Apostles imaged forth Forms of fair virtue, in sublimest mould: While Piety and Painting blent their powers, Taking a cast from Beauty's very soul In lines of love, and lineaments of heaven. And She, the charmer of celestial moods, High Poetry, the heart's young Priestess, came, And on the altar of melodious hours Laid the soft incense of devoutest song. IDEAL RAPTURES. And hence, amid the harmony of things, A while, as on the brink of heaven restored, Rejoiced the grateful Luther. Who can tell, The Promised Land of hope's perpetual dream How greenly-bright before him, then, it smiled! The passion and the principle of song, With full intensity his being fired: 'Twas thus, the poetry of peace and joy Each fine pulsation of his nature thrill'd; And all without, from life internal, took Some answ'ring tone of sympathetic love. Through walks, and woods of Wittemberg he roam'd; Or gave his spirit to the mountain-breeze; And in the carol of rejoicing streams, The leafy warble of the forest-boughs, Or lyric echoes of the laughing wave, In sound, or scene, and all which nature show'd, A charm responsive to himself he found. Nature and man in fine accordance met: Their smiles and tones reciprocally play'd; Her forms of matter to his shaping mind Embodied meaning; and a moral grace From all Her symmetries appear'd to flow. Now was the halcyon of the heart; awhile Bosom'd in peace, the bright-soul'd Monk was blest. The past was praise, for all that vict'ry won; The present prayer, for all which Mercy gives; And o'er the future his prophetic heart Glow'd with entrancement, as Isaiah did, When his lyre trembled with exulting tones Millennial over crown'd Messiah's reign: Till oft, in rapt Imagination's dream, Amid the universe of happy worlds This earth appear'd creation's loved St. John,— Safe on the bosom of redemption's Lord Reclining there in glory, and in rest. And, like th' apostle of a church reform'd, Who has not, in the harmony and heaven Of some high mood of meditative calm, As opes the flower its scented breast of bloom To welcome there each beautifying ray,— Yielded his spirit with expanding joy To Nature, in her eloquence of scene, As if to consciousness he then appeal'd? Till all creation grew personified, And the touch'd earth, to fancy's tender dream, His living counterpart of joy became. As by some harp, when exquisitely strung, A vulgar breeze to music's voice is turn'd When o'er its chords the airy tremor floats, In subtile magic, so, to mind intense, The coarse realities of sense and time Change, as they touch the intellectual powers, To meanings beautiful, and mental types. The prose of earth to poetry of heaven Is thus transform'd, for faith's perusal, there; And oh, ye scenes, ye splendours, and rich sounds, Like inspirations, lo! at once ye act: All sacramental charms of earth, and air, All signs and symbols of redeeming grace Steal into view, with eloquent surprise! Till the pure eye of sainted Thought conceives The dust to overflow with teeming spells, While all things, into sacredness refined, Make parables which prove redemption's plan. Thrice happy they, who thus, by heav'n empower'd, Can find a gospel in the flowers, and leaves! Creation's book then fancy's bible forms; And faith poetic, by the Spirit led, All nature calls a comment on the Cross. In this let holy Love our teacher be! A love perpetual,—for in that supreme, The sabbath's God Himself no sabbath keeps. And then, what great proprietors we are! E'en on His throne the Uncreate is ours By covenant, from everlasting made; And under it entire creation works All good and glory for the church redeem'd. Many have much, yet all desire a more; But less than infinite, to man is nought: The more must be almighty, or 'tis none! But who hath Christ, has God by God bestow'd, And vast Eternity becomes his friend. Then still, thou Sun! Emmanuel's image be, And like a shadow of His glory burn; Thou Moon! His mystic bride on earth, reflect; Planets! that with prophetic radiance gleam; Thou paragon of elemental powers, Myst'ry of waters, never-slumbering Sea! Impassion'd Orator! with lip sublime, Whose waves are arguments which prove a God; Ye Woods! that with tempestuous anthems ring; Ye Winds! whose allelujahs tongue the storm With music's deep magnificence of tone; Ye Mountain-altars! which from earth to heaven Serenely lift your consecrated steps, While the soft grandeur of the silent hills Sinks on the heart like music low, and sad,— Long in your magic each, and all, abide, Some teaching mystery of Christ to show: That hence, in all things, with an eye of praise And heart of prayer, true Faith may ever find By nature, as by grace, her God express'd; And in the temple of creation greet Perpetual glories which His Name enshrine. AFFECTIONS MADE FREE. If ever, since the pulse of feeling play'd In the quick breast of God-created man, Companionless, in isolation pure, The full revealings of his nature might Themselves in moral harmony have shown, 'Twas when the young creation heard him crown'd Her living monarch; while the lyric stars Chanted a birth-day ode, and angels lined The silver battlements of Heaven above, To see a masterpiece of human mould In sinless purity from dust evoked, And stamp'd with features from the Hand of God. Then was the hour, if ever such might dawn, When echoless a mortal heart might throb And still be happy, in itself complete, By woman's smile unwelcomed, and unwed. But, not when paradise within made peace, And paradise without, responsive joy, Was human loneliness by Heaven approved: “It was not good that man should be alone,” And so, a female counterpart was framed In oneness sacramentally profound, From his own being moulded, and educed; And Woman thus to Adam's bower was brought; There the first marriage by almighty hands In stainless Eden was perform'd, and seal'd; And the first miracle Messiah work'd To Wedlock gave the glory of its power: Hence, life monastic came from man alone; But life domestic is from God derived. But she, the Murd'ress of emotions pure, The vile Creatress of mistaken good, Both law and love in nature contravened; And dared, with hand of sacrilegious force, From the young Bosom, where soft feeling dwells, Expunge all instinct, and the soul uproot, To plant, and place it in a coarser soil Blighted and bare, with chills unmanly cursed. But Nature proved an unmonastic Thing! And when in light, the monk of God arose To stay the famine of the soul for truth, The heart was hung'ring for its food of love. Pining, and pent, in passionless remorse It wither'd, by a torturing fetter bound To vow itself to suicidal gloom. Yet, few had fester'd in o'er-righteous chains: Though canons frown'd, and convent-law decreed Death to each heart, by female hearts enticed! And thus, in self-revenge, the blood o'erboil'd In fires of feeling; ruffian passion raged; And homes, which might have been like heavens of bliss, Had holy Wedlock lit the vestal flame, Grew hells impure, unmentionably vile, Where powers of darkness turn'd to priests of lust And Satan saw himself in Rome secure. But he, who brought the buried Scripture forth From tombs of silence, and monastic death, The bright Restorer of domestic bliss At length with dreadless vigour dares to be. Affections are the food of hearts which feel: For such pined Luther; and in Ketha met, Fresh in her maidenhood of life and love, That feeling sympathy fond nature sought. For what, though all around grew black and drear, And the wild echoes of the peasant-war Rang loud in Europe's ear; while reek'd the blood Of thousands, on Thuringa's hoof-worn plain: Yet did the Word about him cast a shield, While o'er him hung the canopy of heaven. The God of marriage was the God of man; Here, on this rock, the thunder-blasts of Rome Sank powerless, as the lisp of summer-winds! Better by far, that flesh and blood should quail, Or, all creation be annull'd in gloom, Than One majestic truth of God be harm'd! In heresy our God Himself we lose; And the big universe a bubble seems, Weigh'd in the balance of a single word Dropt from the lips of His almighty Love! But that was with him, sealing woman's love As heavenly-bright, and by the Saviour blest: And therefore, not by this a Cause sublime Was perill'd; nor the Reformation's ark In danger, when the monk of Wittemberg Rose, in the freedom of a fervid soul, To rive the fetters of monastic vows Asunder, from his heaven-instructed mind; And, lifting his pure conscience in the light Of scripture, up to majesty and truth, Look'd on the world, a husband not ashamed! And round that scene, where his devoted heart The wedded Luther to his Ketha gave, Eternal Wisdom cast approving smiles, And heaven its hymeneal blessings shed. For then was Private Life from priestly lust Deliver'd; peace conjugal back restored, And wedlock in its sainted charm enshrined; While Rome another and a ruder shock Experienced, from the soul of Luther sent; For now, affections, nerved with sudden life, Together with deep principle combined; Till both concenter'd, back to Nature gave A creed which conscience could avow, and act,— To guide the faith, to guard emotion pure, And brighten homes with honourable love Where prison'd Feeling, passionless and pale, Languish'd alone; or, lewd Corruption came To look the Angel, with a demon's heart! And thus, within the haven of a home Luther, at length, his care-toss'd spirit found Anchor'd in peace, and matrimonial joy Secure. And where do Love's fond annals tell A home of heart, more exquisite than his? The once cowl'd Monk, who trod the cloisters dim, And made his melancholy footsteps ring With cadence long and lone, was now become A glowing husband, and a gladden'd sire. And, lovely was it, when his mind, unrobed Of all its panoply of public state, Reposed in sunshine, and, at home retired, Sparkled and play'd around his infant boy; Or else, in laughing sweetness echo'd back The tones of glee, and truths of gay delight Which Ketha from her glowing spirit sent; Or smiled approval, when his portrait rose Under the magic of embroid'ring Art Featured, and form'd. And so, when sombre night Mantled his dwelling with sabbatic peace, Seldom have Angels, as they waft their flight From home to home, on voiceless errands wing'd, A fairer landscape of domestic love And life beheld, than Martin Luther made Around him, with his wife and infant smile. Nor haply, upon heaven's memorial page The meek hosannahs of more thankful minds Have they recorded, than the chants they heard, When sang the great restorer of the Truth Hymns of the heart around his household-shrine. LUTHER MARRIED. A monk was married! how the priesthood raved! But God was with him; and His word approved A deed that shook all Popedom to its base, The convents oped, the Vatican alarm'd, And push'd the world by matrimonial law A century forward into fearless paths Of light, of liberty, and spousal love. And Scripture canonised the act: but, powers In nature also with approval smiled; For imaged wedlock, in the vital bonds, The unions pure, the harmonies profound, The loving sense and sympathy of things,— His fancy by poetic vision saw. And let the hard utilitarian smile, Building religion on a sensual base. A Faith there is, which, like to Luther's, loves The adumbrations of a deeper life Beyond the sense, in Matter's self to trace. Christ and His Church,—for these the world was framed; And thus to souls, with sight divine endow'd The Spirit's Kingdom on this earth to see, Creation glows with poetry for Christ, Through forms of matter unto faith reveal'd. All pangs, all pleasures, faculties, and powers, The hearts of God's elected race can find, Or feel, or suffer, may from Nature draw Tones of respect, and touches of regard, Or something which resembles sympathy. Nor let the worshipper of venal gods Pronounce this pure Imagination's dream; Since, haply, thus the myst'ry may unwind, And what the poet sings a saint admire.— When this fair World to conscious being rose With beauty, and with vernal radiance clad, Why were her forms, her symmetries, and scenes Touch'd by a spell which can the mind pourtray, And by such true analogies reveal An image dim, but exquisite and deep, Of much the moral universe combines? Such forms of nature with the facts of grace, Why do they so responsively apply, That each with each in harmony coheres? Or in that region, where the feelings dwell, Why does our spirit from the sounds and scenes Of Nature, catch a mute intelligence, As if with consciousness of man and mind The speaking magic of her aspect smiled? The festive jubilee of summer-winds; Or soothing descant of a far-off sea; The storm's loud wail; the ocean's sullen roar, Noon with its sun, and midnight with the stars, The Spring, with her sweet family of flowers, Or, widow'd Autumn, with consumptive leaves, And pale-faced Winter in a frozen vest, Why do they all intelligibly bring Hints to the heart, and harmonies for mind? Is this reply, which all Creation gives To human feeling, but the fancy's mock? Or, is not earth a parable divine? And poets, when their inward eyes discern Meanings that flow from matter into mind, Priests of creation, may they not be call'd? For Thou, O Christ! art universal King: By Thee, and for Thee, were not all things made? So, when the Spirit on the mass new-born Of nature brooded, then, with mystic Seal, All matter for Thy Glory was impress'd With types peculiar, with expressive laws, Thy church to show, Thy symbols to expound, And thus preach gospel to our very sense; Till Nature act the orator for Grace, And all creation one gigantic type For Christ and Christianity becomes. And such the creed Imagination holds, When the vast glories of this earth appear But shadows from the Saviour's beauty cast. And seldom hath poetic Sense replied To Loveliness, with more impassion'd glow Than Luther's, when ideal moments reign'd, And his full heart, with purified excess Of sympathy for life's unbounded range, O'erflow'd all nature in one gush of love! Yet, moods of preternatural calm there came, With might of thought, and majesty of dreams And a deep awe beyond all words to voice, Under the mute and melancholy heavens As oft he worshipp'd, in his window-shade At starry moonlight. Then, th' unpillar'd vault, By viewless Energy for aye upheld, Harangued him like a holy Sign, which spake How like that arch of glory God sustains The Church elect, by bleeding merit won. Or when the moon through some black cloud emerged In radiant victory from a brief eclipse, To him a symbol of refulgent grace It seem'd, of how the Reformation's cause From the cold darkness of imperial frowns, At length, would glide to glory and to peace. POWER OF PRAYER. Yet, not from nature, solitude, or night, Nor wedded life, with all its household-sweets, The sober quiet or the sterling joy, His force to grapple with infernal Arms, Wisdom to guard or prudence to restrain The lawless plunges of impassion'd will,— The brave Reformer drew: below the skies No charm was found which could have moulded him: From One high Source both cause, and courage sprang. And that, divine!—from spirit-breathing prayer Hour after hour communing with His God. He loved the Bible; and he lived it, too; Till each bright promise to experience turn'd By faith transmuted, or by love enjoy'd. The source of Luther was a strength of Prayer Frequent, and full, and fervidly inspired, As oft the castled gloom of Coburg heard. Though loud the Reformation-battle grew And empires as with moral earthquake heaved, Throned was his spirit in Elysian calm! But, where man wonders, faith can all explain. 'Twas God within, made Luther great without; Whether, against that triple-crown'd Pretence, The mitred Antichrist of Rome, he hurl'd His thunders; or, on sacerdotal crimes Pour'd the just vengeance of his free-born words, Prayer was his panoply; the shield and strength That arm'd him for the fight, and kept him there. With this, the World, the Arch-fiend and the Flesh Combined, he nobly fought, and bravely fell'd. And we inherit what his prayers procured: For, light in conscience, liberty in creed, And the pure freedom of our British faith, How much to blessings drawn by Luther's voice From the high sanctuary of heaven, they owe! Yea, half the glory living Empires boast Springs from that mercy which the monk procured, When Godhead listen'd to a Luther's prayer! And round a privilege august as this Less than inspired no language can entwine The wreath, how due! of evangelic praise. Prayer from eternity true riches gains To make the poverty of time less poor; Heaven down to earth, and earth to heaven it brings, While Love with Deity by faith confers: And mark! through nature, providence, and grace What miracles hath mighty prayer achieved! The kingly Elements their thrones have left To bow before it, and obey, though vast, Its high dominion: Flood, and Sea, and Fire Have soften'd their severity of force, Suspended by it; Sun and Moon have paused In wonder, on their cars of wheeling flame, As if arrested by th' Almighty's touch; And the wild brute, which not a world could bend, Meek as a lamb, before a Saint has crouch'd Harmless and mute, when it beheld him pray! Heroes in heart, in principle, or power, Hath prayer alone with high perfection crown'd: While saints, and martyrs, and the men of old, Giants in grace, who grappled with the Fiend Or threw him bravely in the spirit's fight, By valiant prayer their elevation reach'd: And earth's Emmanuel, in His day of flesh Outwatch'd the midnight with His mountain-prayer; And from the deep abyss of Godhead drew His faith intense, his fortitude divine: And all, who love the cause eternal, must Like their pure Master, fight the world with prayer, And strike for God, by God himself inspired! DOMESTIC LIFE, AND WEDDED LOVE. From out the Bosom of paternal bliss When came the Second of th' almighty Three, And God, in human image bodied forth, Alighted on man's world of sin and death As Prince of peace, and Purchaser of life, How lived, how spake, this Archetype of all? E'en like his Person, did His life appear, Divinely human, with coequal grace: In Godhead,—never sunk the God beneath; In Manhood,—never raised the man above; To each extreme symmetrical and true, Believer! there, thine own Emmanuel hail. How awful was He! when the cloud of flesh Gleam'd with the lustre of indwelling God. Thy steadfastness, vast Nature! from the sleep Of twice two thousand years, by Him was moved; For all those laws, by Science so revered, Their changeless glory to His changing will Yielded, like vassals by their king o'erawed. He look'd—Creation by his glance was thrill'd; He spake—the Elements each word obey'd; Earth, Sea, and Air their royal sceptres threw Down at His feet, and fell before their Lord; While shrinking, as with conscious dread commoved, Back from his word the rushing Storm recoil'd, Soothed its mad roar, and like an infant smiled Itself to sunshine and soft peace again. Blindness, at His command, the sun beheld; And Deafness heard Him when the fiat came; Disease was Health; and Lameness felt her Limbs With miracles of energy to move, While the dead body from the bier uprose Beneath the resurrection of His word! And, awful was He! when the curse was borne: While His bow'd Head was crimson'd o'er with blood, Then shook the Earth, and shudder'd as the groan Of Christ appall'd her! while a deep eclipse Dropt like an eyelid o'er the flaming Sun, Dreading to gaze on God incarnadined! But, in that syncopé of mortal hopes, That pause tremendous in our human fate When sepulchred Messiah, cold and pale, Seal'd in the rock a dead Redeemer lay, While Nature seem'd as if with stern revenge To triumph o'er Her pallid victor there,— How awful was He when His grave-clothes stirr'd! When the rock trembled with an earthquake-pant, Till the stone, radiant with angelic touch, Roll'd from His sepulchre; and, rising up In perfect majesty of might, behold The Saviour gather'd to a God again, Martyr at once, and Master of the tomb! But, gentle was He! with all grace of man Completely, as with charms of Godhead crown'd; For He who came, by Love eterne inspired, From heights celestial, with a pitying stoop The low horizon of our world to meet, Not in the costume of corporeal flesh Alone was found; but, Fellowship with man The life of Jesus bodied forth, and breathed; The accent of created love He caught; The sunshine of created joy He shared; The sorrow of terrestrial sighs He heaved; And with the tenderness of mortal tears Moisten'd his eyelids, when a sister wept. His form was human, and His feelings, too! Thus, Manhood there in archetype may see Each moral beauty which a life presents When holy; where affections crowd the scene, And heart and home a mingled Eden make, While virtue follows where the Saviour went Through haunts of love, and bowers of social bloom. And thus religion, like her Master, glides With touching glory, or with tender grace O'er duteous walks of Life's diurnal round. For, while on wing celestial faith can waft Up to the Throne a meditative soul, Down to the actual with a graceful love, Where plain Humanity in humble guise The man develops, can Religion stoop, And o'er it cast her consecrating smile. So, from the gaze of public life retired 'Mong shades domestic, where Affection blooms, And feeling all its happy foliage sheds, A Hero now, whom death nor dungeon awed, Serene and simple as a peasant lives. No lofty, loveless, and disdainful looks Around him here, severest judgment finds. But, frank and free, with apostolic mien, And full-toned manhood in its perfect type,— A husband in the great Reformer hail, Like Martin Luther and like nothing more! No stern pretension, borne with saintly pomp, Mere actor made him. In the walks of home Lord of himself, His individual mind Free from the fetters of o'ermastering fame He kept: his life was freedom to the last, Stamp'd in the mould simplicity admires. The Man was never in his Name absorb'd, Chain'd like a captive to his own renown. Framed in the homeliness of cottage-worth, A racy humour, and a rough disdain For mock supremacies for mean effect, For little greatness and for large pretence, Were his: and he who held all Rome at bay And bulwark'd nations by his brave appeals, Looks he less lofty, to those hearts which love The sterling and the true, when playful seen In the mild sunshine of a married state? There, could he sparkle round the social board, As romp'd the infant on his rocking knee; While the glad mother, sat with glowing face And sunn'd her feelings in the father's smile. Yes! beautiful, behind the scenes to gaze, And there no mock attempt, whose aping pride Would play the Hero in ascetic gloom, To witness; but that solid worth of sense, And healthful sanctity, whose fervid power The christian fulness of o'erflowing heart Betoken. Lofty in his bosom beat The pulse of principle, and great design: But not alone, or frowningly aloof, A frigid, stern and adamantine Thing Whose life in passionless contempt retires From warm reality's most welcome hour,— Not thus, the avenger of the Bible lived. In faith a hero, but in heart a man, With him the simple and the great combined, And both together made a blended charm Beyond the drama of affected life To feel, though play'd with Art's consummate guile. COMMUNION WITH NATURE. And Nature, through her world of types appears Simplicity in grandeur thus to teach. Expressive mountains! from whose massive forms The dread Almighty speaks Himself to man By eloquence, which hearing mind translates, How often, underneath their shade august, Or in the hollows of some green descent, The tiny flowers in tenderness and bloom Wave their young beauty! or, infantile plants Bow to the breeze their unresisting heads, While the faint lisp of dropping leaves returns A murmur'd echo to the rippling stream Which runs beside them, with loquacious play. And thus, methinks, beneath that mental shade The tow'ring giants of the mind produce, Simplicity in loving calm delights To watch the flowerets of affection bloom; And see those lilies in the heart arise Which make the garden of our spirit green, Breathing mild fragrance o'er affection's world. And hence, admire we with revering gaze True Greatness, when it lays all thunder by, Till the soft childhood of the heart returns; And solemn wisdom, sparkling into wit, Can gild the heights of intellect with smiles. But chief from music came the master-spell Which Luther, like a spirit's echo loved! To him it seem'd a charm divinely framed, An earthless magic, out of mystery born, And so with heaven instinct, that Satan fled When Harmony her spells began to breathe, Or sank o'er passion, like a healing dew Pure from the fount of freshness in the skies. 'Twas thus the poetry of private life Around him, with an unresisted reign, Gather'd and glow'd. But oh! ye quiet fields, Where, lost in sunshine, sang the soaring birds In wing'd delight and ever-warbling song, How would he listen to your choral joy, Till the gay summer of his spirit smiled With loving answer to the scene it loved! And often, when some fever hot and harsh From human outrage, wither'd him with pangs Of weary anguish till the spirit wept, Didst thou, meek Nature! with maternal smile Look through his soul and laugh the cloud away. To him thy shrines, thy solitudes profound, Thy hues and shades, and harmonies perceived Brought more than feeling to his heart of faith. And so, the very flowers seem silent hymns, And, by their aspect of persuasive bloom, Remind him oft of Eden long no more; Or, bid him muse on what the world may be When second paradise again shall dawn: Since all which fell by Adam's guilty fall From outward glory into penal gloom, And all of kingship which the soul enjoy'd When man, as Monarch of creation, ruled And, as anointed Priest of paradise, became The mouth of Nature and her mute delights,— To pristine splendour shall once more arise, Till crownless Manhood wear a crown again; Or earth redeem'd, Messiah's palace be, And shine, as round His central throne it rolls, The loved metropolis of sumless worlds. PARADISE RESTORED. And who, amid some holy trance of thought On destined man, as prophet, priest, and king, Hath never vision'd how his primal soul In the bright mould of innocence was stamp'd, When lord and master of this living world The Ancestor of human kind was crown'd? Who hath not ponder'd, or profoundly sigh'd In the deep hush of some diviner mood, O'er the dead glories of that regal scene When all Creation, by his lip baptised, Look'd in his face as King on nature's throne? For what is Science, but a shadow cast From the pure substance of primeval Mind? A reflex dim, indefinite and deep, Of light departed in the gloom of sin? Or, what is Justice, but our priesthood felt, The moral echo of supreme desire That God and conscience may in one combine? Or, what this appetite for boundless sway, This hunger of the heart to rule, and reign, But sense of kingship in our soul alive, A royal longing for a vanish'd crown? By law of mild association led From nature's step-stones, to ethereal heights Of Things that shall be, thus the heart ascends. A mute theology all nature makes: The very ground no vain religion breathes, Where thorn and thistle, blent with fruit and flower, Both cross and curse by intimation teach. And, when from feeling unto faith we mount, What fine accordance doth Redemption show Between the ruin and the rise of man! For, in thy Person and thy Spirit, Lord, A re-production of those Trinal Powers, Or threefold state of majesty entire When priesthood, prophecy, and kingship crown'd The Man consummate, Faith's adoring eye In dim rehearsal, or in dawning grace May witness. Hence our Being, at the best, Is but an embryo of the life to be. Philosophy a mere precursor looks; All high attainments but its preludes are; And science but presentiment appears Of Power which manhood, when redemption brings The primal glories of our birthright back, In full millennium shall at length enjoy. Behold a Centre! for our yearnings form'd, That oneness, where all aspirations blend When o'er the ruin of ourselves we roam; And not from nature up to nature's God, But down from nature's God, look nature through. 'Tis here, the meaning of their mystic strife Passion and Principle alone explain. The hell we merit, or the heaven we make, The poet's Eden and the painter's dream, With whatsoe'er creative Genius cites By shaping vision from her scenic world; Together, with all temples and all shrines A ritual heart instinctively erects, These, by their secret unison of aim, In blind concurrence to one Centre tend,— E'en to regain what Sin's vast forfeit took From earth of beauty or from man of bliss. And what an Eden to prophetic mind Predestined Earth by sight and sound unveils! Oh, wise, beyond the learning of all books, And learn'd, beyond the learning of The Schools, And rich, beyond creation's gold to give, The man, who thus by deep communion binds His heart with Nature's, in maternal bonds. A great proprietor of glories he! Monarch of inward happiness at home, And with the Universe a sharer deep In all the march and movement of a life Without embodied, or within inspired. And what though Age, with shaded brow and cheek, Or eye made solemn by a sense of death, No longer, in the wild and wildering glow Of new-born passion, looks on nature's scene As once impassion'd Boyhood loved to do, Gay as the sunbeam gambolling at his side, Or headlong as the breeze that round him play'd,— Still, not the less, may life's autumnal dreams Be touch'd with beauty; and, not seldom, find Meanings which melt, and mysteries that thrill The musing heart which Nature's lover owns. Through earth, and ocean, sky, and breathing air, The ever-ancient and the ever-young Creation, by persuasive charm, appeals To youth and age, when genially inspired; And by her moveless laws a symbol gives To fleeting life, of permanence and power; Till haply, in the hush of higher moods, We mount aloft on meditation's wing To Him, the Changeless! in Whose present thought Both past and present make perpetual now; While all the ages of unreckon'd time Are but the pulses of Eternity Around Him throbbing, on his dateless Throne. CATECHISM. Far as Imagination's wing can roam Or free conception take its daring flight, We love to image an Almighty power Unfolding boundlessness of life, and love For ever. Throned in secrecies of awe, Unfathomably within Himself retired, We vision worlds, as creatures of His will Around Him summon'd: but the stooping grace Of Love creative, when it moulds a flower, Or makes an insect happy, thrills the heart Like tearful music, and attunes within Anthems of silent wonder. While the great In Godhead magnifies adoring mind, In His minuteness how we greet His name! Since in the circle of an atom's range Dwell the same Attributes which made and move A universe, with all its breathing worlds! If God, in great things, be supremely great, To feeling, looks He greater still, in small: For, when the Worker and His work appear To human sense in harmony combined, Religion, then, is reason at its height: And our imagined Infinite is graced With attributes, where just proportion reigns. But, when some particle, or pulse, infolds A Mind which makes eternity its home, And through the chambers of immensity Moves to and fro, creatively divine, Then, dazzled reason into faith absorb'd, Worships the Mystery; and with wonder glows To watch the working of our God complete, In all things center'd—no where circumscribed! Yes, while He wheels ten thousand worlds along, In the same instant, lo! He stoops to count The tiny populace a sunbeam holds, Time the quick beating of an insect's heart, Or close the eyelids of a babe for rest: As if nought else eternal Thought embraced Each atom feels the concentrated God; While our protection, by its grandeur, proves All mercies waft th' Almighty on their wings! And thus, if bold Analogy may dare The human with divine to parallel, With touching grace a moral sight appeals To saintly Virtue, in the heart enshrined, When he, who storm'd with supernatural force Round the vile Popedom, till its pillars shook, Sank to the level of a simple child, And won frail childhood to the creed he framed. The son of thunder, soften'd to a breeze, Behold him shroud the lightning of his soul In shading meekness; while the hand which hurl'd The false Decretals to devouring fire, Plies o'er some little book, or teaching page Where infancy may learn the name to lisp Of Jesus; or its budding mind unfold In faith and freshness, to the call of heaven. His was the heart that glow'd with all the grace Which pure compassion for the spirit breathes. One living soul, from sin and hell redeem'd, He weigh'd it in the balance of that Blood Whose every drop with Deity was priced! And thus, behold him, with paternal smile, And graceful stoop of his gigantic mind Bow to the task, a creed for youth condense, In language artless as the lisping mouth Of Childhood could pronounce, or read, or pray. While reason's light through fancy's prism falls In lines of error on the proud man's view, Luther himself a child with children knew, That Cross beneath, where nature must again Be born. He felt, to know he nothing knew, Was knowledge, passing what the world calls wise: And so, if mysteries, like the mountains, cast A shadow deep'ning as their truths advance Nearer and nearer to the kindred heaven, He left them, in the glory of their gloom, Untouch'd by reason with its carnal gaze. And like him, may we learn to pause, and pray; Nor argue down the glory we deny. If Grace hath spoken, 'tis for Guilt to hear And learn by rev'rence more than mind can reach: Since God unshrouded, would be God no more; Remove the mystery, and the Almighty's gone! HUMILITY WITHOUT FAITH. There is religion in the reign of night, When earth entranced, and heaven ethereal grows, And planets orb'd with palpitating beams, In radiant eloquence to man reveal Their sacred beauty; while the loving Stars Unseal their eyelids, and with vestal gaze This world salute, till our attracted souls Responsively their looks of love return. 'Tis then the energies of mind escape From sordid fetters, and, like eagles, sweep The dazzling firmament of Thought divine, Sparkling with truths unnumber'd as unnamed; Till, earthward dropping on exhausted plume, Like the awed Psalmist of the night, they feel A soft religion from the sky descend, A charm'd humility, which preaches thus:— “Say, what is Man, when paragon'd with Worlds? How mean a speck, how miserably small. Minute, beyond minuteness to pourtray, The orbit where he walks, and weeps, and dies! And He, the Architect, Whose fiat call'd And will'd this universe of worlds abroad, Where is the Temple that can hold His praise, Or mind created, which can worship Him From whose dread glory not one ray would melt, Were all this bright magnificence to fade? For if deep Ocean, with her sumless waves, Not less in majesty of water rolls If haply some expiring billow sink; Or forest huge, whose patriarchal trees Their wild luxuriance to the winds present, Not less o'erawes us, though some leaflet die, Then would no countless throng of worlds, though dead, Or stricken by some everlasting blight, One shade on His supernal glory cast Who makes and unmakes, moulds, and masters all, But in Himself consummate God abides!” And may not thus our lesson'd being lie Low at the footstool of this felt Immense, To learn humility from all it finds? A contrast wise, comparison profound, Nocturnal splendours may they not inspire? When from the fever of his day-worn life At length escaping, pensive and alone, Oft may some Mystic of the heart delight To soothe excitement, in that sainted calm Breathed from thy presence, oh, ambrosial Night Of solitude, serenity, and stars! Thine is the hour for poetry, and prayer; Searchings how deep, and soarings how divine Are then experienced! Time and earth depart; The shadows of exterior life recede Like cloud-mist from a morning vale uproll'd; And on the Infinite we seem to gaze. 'Tis thus, beneath the overawing heavens Man sinks to nothing; and his world becomes An atom, twinkling in eternity, And Life,—the scintillation of a soul Radiant, but restless with its tiny gleam, That sparkles into suff'ring, and expires! But here, Perversion, by its with'ring breath, Would blast humility with chills of doubt, And Christ from his created world expel By logic, from our littleness educed And call'd transcendant: “Can this puny ball Of Nature, this revolving speck of earth, Seen like a glow-worm 'mid the gorgeous blaze Of suns, and systems, be a proper world For Deity in Flesh to seek, or save?” And yet, this argument, so base and blind, Philosophy and faith alike o'erthrow With swift prostration. Sceptic! pause awhile, Nor dream that thus from orphan'd earth recedes Redemption, since in nature's volume lies The principle of thy profound rebuke. Bend to the dust a microscopic gaze, There God in atoms, e'en as God in worlds, Witness! and worship with believing awe. To Him no magnitude as great appears, And no minuteness, as the small can be; Gradations all in Godhead are absorb'd And vanish; languor cannot Him relax, Nor low, nor lofty, vast nor various, bring Distraction o'er Him. Hence, we rev'rence God When the frail wonders of an insect-wing Or radiant orbits of revolving worlds, The traces of consummate mind reveal. Jehovah, while vast Heaven His word upholds, And life and matter, motion, space and time Form but the channel where His will evolves, Can note and number all whom earth contains! Observe the monad in minutest play, Robe the soft leaf, the choral winds attune, Direct a sunbeam to its shining toil, Or guard frail infancy on tott'ring feet From death or danger; or, at balmy night, The silken eyelids of young Sleep bedew With slumber, watching o'er unconscious breath! Thus may Philosophy and Faith sincere Their creed unite; and when on high we view Yon great epiphany of glorious worlds, And echo back with thought's devoutest tone The starry hymns by Fancy heard to roll, We sink not, by immensity appall'd; But in the sacred glory of our creed Can call our Lord, the Master of it all! Moreover, God-reflecting Mind is ours Though faint, and feeble; nor can Truth deny, A single thought more deity involves Than all the beauty of yon blazing orbs, If mind be absent. Therefore, while we own The sad Palmyra of our ruin'd state, And what a Tadmor in the desert-soul Humanity on this soil'd earth presents, Yet hither, from the heavens all heavens above Descended, by paternal Glory sent, Divine Emmanuel! Here His feet have trod; Around His awful head our sun hath shined; This air His breath of purity inspired, And here the music of His lips was pour'd In speech, and doctrine; miracles illumed His mission; and each element confess'd The bleeding glory of that Saviour's wounds Whose heart for sin on Calvary bled and broke! And thus, not all unfelt, nor all unknown This orb minute, by God in flesh redeem'd, In time or in eternity can be. Rather may reason, when by faith enlarged, The charter'd empress of all worlds pronounce An earth so ransom'd, with such Blood restored; And in the form of God incarnate see How human Flesh outsoars the Angels far, And mounts, in Jesus, an almighty throne. ANGELIC CONTEST. Hence, wisdom does not back with doubt recoil, By reason's name made reasonlessly proud, When told that Man a mystic platform proves Where clashing angels, for contested souls, With, or against, the dread Creator fight. Here, Attributes eterne their cause have staked; Here, Character divine itself unfolds; And from it men and angels wisdom learn, While all untouch'd by accident, or change, Divinely perfect as their nature is,— How love and Law in harmony prevail. Thus from the Bible heaven-taught lore perceives The true position to our earth assign'd. For, though embedded in a brilliant mass Of worlds on worlds beyond all number vast, Like some mean province, where ephem'ral dust Shaped into men to nothing hourly dies, It hardly glimmers,—thinking Angels see In pardon'd myriads of immortal souls Glories which render heaven more glorious still! Since for their adoration Christ reveal'd A new Apocalypse of God to man. Thus they who once unwither'd Eden walk'd With man, a human paradise to share, Now when the banner of a Fiend has waved Defiance, yet on our dismantled earth Of sin and treason cast a yearning gaze; And watch, and wonder, worship and admire Unfolded secrets of forgiving Love Developed here. And when some lurid gleams Lighted, perchance, the features of the lost Archangel, with a hope that ruin'd Man With God unreconciled must ever be, And all His attributes to crisis brought, How did their wings ecstatically wave, And loud their endless gratulations sweep The arches of eternity with praise, God's masterpiece of perfect Grace to hail! While he, the Anarch of temptation, sank, To plot in darkness for his own despair. Thus Fiends against, but Angels for, our souls Are now contending: on the Cross sublime Their fix'd and fascinated eyes they bend, Which glisten o'er its glories; while they cry, “Depth within depth, O God! how deep art Thou, Ark'd in Thyself, unvision'd and unshared!” The councils of divinity they scan Nor fathom; yet such vast revealings flow From our Emmanuel, that this world becomes A focus, where redeeming Wisdom brought The fulness infinite of Love to bear, And taught the Seraphim a song, how new! FALLEN ANGELS. Yet while angelic bosoms heave with love, And Watchers bright from heavenly mansions glide Down to this earth, the prodigal of worlds, And with the elder love of sinless Truth Bend o'er our doom, with ever-breathing care Of pure compassion, are we not beset By fatal opposites? by fiendish Hosts Curtain'd in secrecy of hate and hell? Shapeless, and sightless, round all hearts and hours Inaudibly they steal: in joy, or gloom, Present alike to poison or pollute Man's being. Sin their fascination forms, And hell in man, for their lost heaven atones: So deep the horrors of infernal hate! And what experience have the fiendish band Who haunt creation with their spells accursed, From human mind and misery derived, As, age on age, to murder souls they watch, And dog them to the very gates of heaven! Six thousand years of study and of sin Have deeply, through the labyrinthine heart Instructed Satan how to wend his way, Unfelt, unfear'd, deceiving as he goes. Him Luther imaged, with an awe-struck mind As God of this world, howsoe'er disguised, In moments shaded with satanic gloom And hours of harrowing darkness, when the blood Ran wildly, aud his heated brain was worn By fev'rish over-task. And, is the Fiend A power impersonal, by shapeless awe Summon'd around us, when the soul is weak? Not thus did Luther into names abstract Reduce the Devil; but a Person own The Archfiend, such as fearless Paul unveil'd, And, like his pattern, made high reason bow Before the majesties of truth inspired, Believing firmly what his Bible spake. As fact to thought, or law to will is framed, So scripture to his faith a reason was: And he who shrunk not from Satanic foes Mitred, or sceptred, but by zeal inflamed, High o'er the heavens could wing his dreadless flight To scorch the angels with a scathing curse, If other than the gospel-truth they preach'd!— To fight the devil God's own armour took. Mail'd with the Spirit's panoply of prayer Thus was he taught with ghastly fiends to fight, Weapon'd by grace to lead infernal war. And was he feeble, while his faith was strong? Or rather, from his creed heroic might Derived he not? Simplicity was strength, In that deep mystery, whose unfathom'd glooms And paths untrod defy adventurous mind. Here, God is reason to Himself alone; To us, mere revelation, and no more, He deigns to be. Still, o'er forbidden ways By Him foreclosed, its undisturbéd flight The pride of Reason in her pagan dreams Presumes to wing; but drops abash'd, at length, Down to th' horizon whence conceit arose. Oh! for a heart as docile, and as deep In things divine, as that Immortal show'd, Whose genius round the sun, and mystic stars, And through the cycles of immensity The march and movement of eternal Laws Interpreted; and track'd each orbèd maze, And, like a Priest o'er planetary worlds Presiding, taught us how the spheres revolve. And yet that Solomon in starry lore Unrivall'd, whose pervading spirit read Creation's secrets, with untroubled eye, The Light anatomised to separate hues By clear dissection, and with steady hand Felt the tide-heavings of great Ocean's heart Throbbing for ever with a billowy pulse,— Sat like a pupil down to Nature's page; And from her canons all that creed educed Which makes him seem an oracle of mind Devout: who, like th' apocalyptic saint Of Patmos, hath for earthly science shown, What he for heavenly,—God behind the veil! And let the worshippers of bright result Forget not, thus impassion'd Luther won The bloodless laurels his brave memory wears,— E'en by adherence to substantial Faith. Simple as Newton, who could soar and pray, Building philosophy on fact alone, Luther in faith could Luther's self renounce, And, like the scholar of the Holy Ghost, Learn hallow'd science from the lips of God. And, deep the knowledge which his spirit drew From Heaven's own page, of devils and of men. A stern arena, where a sightless crowd Of Fiends and Angels in dread conflict ranged; Or battle-scene, where strangely-awful Powers Muster and mingle, and their arms unsheath For good or evil,—did our world become To him, who saw it in eternal light. For, just as when some Empire's outraged heart Big with emotion, swells with surging zeal, If but a subject by his slaughter'd life For Her be fallen, and around his grave Pours the rich life-blood of Her dearest sons,— So is our earth, though dismal and depraved, And darkly mean with vaster worlds compared, A centre where the Chivalries of heaven Marshal their forces, and with fiends engage. The terror of their arms, eye cannot see; The rushing of their plumes, we do not hear, Nor view the motions of their mystic flight; But yet, the contest is for countless Souls, While for the royalties of heaven they strike! And who, save those who fetter with the bonds Of clay all faculties of finer scope, In some rapt hour when mind is half unearth'd Like Luther's, have not felt the fight unseen, And through each dim transparency of sense Vision'd a battle, which the soul surrounds? GOD OF THIS WORLD. So felt the man, whom Superstition fear'd, And Satan ever with a savage watch Haunted, and down to his own hell desired By dark temptation of the soul, to bring. And hence to him, thus tempted, tried, and torn, No mere abstraction, impotent as vain; No vile creation of monastic gloom The arch-Fiend was; nor, to his hell confined: But here, on earth, in dark unrest employ'd, And round the axis of infernal guile Revolving ceaselessly his cruel plans, Luther beheld him; such as God asserts, By will, and intellect, and power endow'd, In living personality array'd Of being actual; Lord of souls undone, Maker of death, and monarch of despair; Who would the universe to cinders blast, Undo redemption, all our mercies blight, And hear a jubilee in Earth's last groan! And must we, to some lacerating dream Such agonies as rent th' undreading heart Of Luther, in our sceptic age refer? Was it with Phantoms of a brain diseased, Or Actions, out of gloomy thought evoked Fanatical and false, that saints of old Contended? Or, by dismal clouds o'erveil'd, Did Prophets only with the air contend? Were brave Apostles, when their spirits bled, By Satans of the mind alone convulsed? Or, did the God-man, in His day of flesh Tempted like men, no thrilling combat face, But simply, by internal vision tried, Fight with black Nothing in the form of fiend? Let dread Gethsemane to this reply! There, while the bloody sweat from Christ was wrung, As round Him, in His human weakness, rush'd With eyes which hunger'd on his pangs to feed And wings that flutter'd with a fiendish joy, The Hosts of darkness,—let the sceptic ask If that be air, which made Emmanuel shake! They mock the Devil who obey him most: But hearts made simple by a power divine, Believe the combat, and partake it too. The Friend of sinners was the Foe of sin, And therefore, saints with Satan must contend As did their Captain for His cross and crown. Such was the creed our Saxon hero held. Yes! that brave Spirit, who in public stood And calmly watch'd the papal furnace heat, Prepared to battle with its sevenfold fires,— Prostrate and pale, with agonising tears Bound in the blackness of temptation's night Behold him, like a reed of sorrow, now! And they, whose wisdom faith and fear produce, Touch'd by no common awe, will come to view A martyrdom, beyond what fire inflicts In the torn depths of Luther's tortured breast When Satan fell'd him; and the shades of Hell Frown'd on his heart their horrible dismay! Oh! there seemed moments when th' Almighty frown'd, When Sinai over Calvary hung its cloud Till legal thunders struck the Gospel dumb, And Jesu vanish'd into viewless air! Then, pardon'd sin unpardon'd aspect took; While conscience like a scowling demon lour'd Full on the past: and e'en the Bible lost Its music; till the melody of truth Turn'd to strange discord, where no tones of grace Or God were found! Then, fiend on fiend began Between the Saviour and his soul to rush, In raging darkness; while at times he shook In fancy o'er the flaming deep of Hell, And hover'd, as by grasping demons held. But he, who bled beneath satanic blows, Hereafter kiss'd the rod his heart endured And found it gilded with a Father's smile. For need there was, of educating woes To pierce him to the centre, till he pray'd, And the great Luther grew a little child Safe in the hands of his almighty Sire. Since much of darkness in his light remain'd; And much terrene with his celestial mix'd; And much of Adam with his faith there blent,— Oh, what but Wisdom, in divinest force, Knew how to build a perill'd Luther up? Hence, not a pang his inner being tore Which was not needed, and by Heaven o'er-ruled To tame that temper, whose volcanic fires So often rent him with outbursting rage. Luther was great, and God would keep him so, By proving in Himself all greatness lay, And there alone the Reformation stood. LIFE A SPIRITUAL CONFLICT. Reader! the combat rages darkly still Around thee; though an unrent cloud of flesh Shut from thy soul their movement and their march, And the dread soldiery by Hell array'd, Yet, in the midst of Satan's host art thou Contending: were thy veiling flesh withdrawn, Full on thy spirit what a battle-field Where all the Chivalries of heaven contend, And the dread Sympathies of darkness fight For souls immortal—would at once outflame! But not with garments roll'd in blood, or death; And not with weapons which our eyes perceive; But sightless, these unbodied Hosts engage; And therefore, Satan is the sense's mock, The sneer of science and the scorn of fools. But thy revealings, Faith! are ever true And most tremendous, when the most denied. A Devil doubted ends in God disown'd,— Till the first glance a disembodied Mind Takes of the truth behind the veil disclosed, Looks on the Fiend, who made himself a lie To rock the sinner into damning rest. Reader! believe, the combat rages still; No pause, and no parenthesis of love Or pity for our world the Fiend allows. Darkness his throne, destruction his delight, Ruin and ravage his dominion make, And earthquakes seem the echoes of His tramp. But chief to battle with the sainted host, Fighting beneath the banner of their King Crimson'd with blood, and blazon'd by his cross Redemptive, does the Prince of Hell advance. Thus Luther felt: and thus shall ever feel, And like him in the spirit's fight, contend E'en to the gasp and agony of faith,— The heirs of Light and heroes of our God. “The Serpent's head the woman's seed Shall bruise!” So spake the Lip almighty; and to man Revolted then the Incarnation preach'd In promise, which by grasp prophetic spann'd Ages of conflict in the church to come; Till time's worn clock his closing hour shall strike, And this phantasmal scene where Satan fights, This whited sepulchre of sin and woe, This prison-house where dungeon'd nature pines,— A thousand years of hallow'd rest shall have In one long sabbath of millennial peace! But not till hurl'd by thunder-blasts divine Down to his pit, in chaining darkness bound, The mystic “Dragon” will from earth withdraw: But fiercely to the last, a fight maintain Implacable, against all truth array'd. So from the first imperial Rome he fired With Pagan fury; when that flame was quench'd By blood of martyrs, lo! an Arian creed Flooded the church with desolating tides; And when they ceased, Platonic visions came And round the Cross a dazzling falsehood wreathed; Till papistry in full-blown horror rose,— The last perfection of satanic guile. Perpetual motion of a will depraved He was, and is, and shall for ever be As Prince of darkness, from his throne of death Dispensing ruin. Who his sway can meet, Or stretch the word to where his sceptre waves O'er time, and scene, and universal man! For every wheat, he sows a rival tare In the vast field where faith and virtue thrive: Each ward of sin and selfishness he knows, And so, for each some fitting key he finds Wherewith to enter, and the heart possess. And let the mockers of the World unseen The solemn findings of experienced hearts In this believe,—that like the Saxon monk's, A life of faith is one long battle now, Beyond the passion of excited words To utter, when the heat of conflict comes! As conscience preaches, so temptation tries By Him directed: hence, no mood is safe, No scenes are shelter'd, and no hours secure From art Infernal. Ask some thoughtful Mind How often, when th' inflated world hath shrunk With all its forms, its follies and its fears Down to a shade, before the solid truths And substance of eternity believed, How often then, when resolution winds Our being up, by tension most sublime, To heaven's pursuit and love's majestic toils, Back to the low and little we are lured! Fever'd as ever, and with fretting pangs And noisome cares inexorably mean Again involved: as if this earth were home, And immortality below the skies! No height in grace, no depth in guilt forbids Our dread assaulter. Attributes divine How oft he covers with deforming shade, Darkens for dread, or deepens for despair, Or softens down to sin's presuming dream Till God a Sentiment almighty grows, For weak indulgence! Then, the Law he wields, Fangs its dread curse with everlasting fire, And on the gibbet of tormenting doubt Racks frighten'd conscience in perpetual gloom. For though in health, when light the blood appears And all looks bland which in Jehovah dwells, Sin like a trifle of the past becomes, Or vacant nothing, with a sounding name; Yet when the dampness of the tomb bechills Our nature; when fierce retribution frowns Black on the spirit, from the bar of God, Then sin, which once a moral pigmy seem'd But scarce apparent, like a giant swells Upward to heaven, and with some horrid shade Beclouds The Infinite, on Whom it falls. And more than this, the arch-Deceiver dares! For He eternity in time contracts And time to false eternity dilates, When cheated fancy to his wand replies; And not one grace The Spirit's hand bestows, For which no counterpart in passion finds This dreadful Parodist of God to man! But, chief that Book, where inspirations breathe And God in language human guilt accosts, He yearns to silence, contradict, or change. Still, praise to God! His heroes do not fight In this fell combat, by their faith alone. The Lord The Spirit leads them to the field: And none can perish, o'er whose shielded heads Waves His pure banner of protecting grace. Safely through Him they grapple with the Foe By brave endurance, till the field be won; When Angels, with a battle-shout of praise, Welcome to glory those heroic saints Who cut their way unwounded to the skies! And thus, what girded Luther for his fight Doth each bold Gideon in the cause of heaven Apparel now,—an armour spirit-proof, Burnish'd and bright like that our “Captain” wore When He and Satan for creation fought. OMNIPRESENCE OF THE SPIRIT. Omniscient Teacher of regen'rate mind! Vicar of Christ! who art to men redeem'd Soul of their souls, and Light of light within, Vast in Thy sway but viewless in Thy strength, Thou o'er the chaos of the earth new-born Didst move, and print it with Thy plastic seal And inspiration. Beauty hence began, Order, and shape and symmetry arose; For Thou of all the Consummator art, In the green earth, or garnish'd heaven display'd: Since Nature is Thine organ, and is moved By secret impulse from Thyself inspired. Her laws, her lineaments, and loveliness Are but expressions of Thy shaping will, The outward index to Thine inward Hand Creative: beauty is Thy vest Terrene, Grandeur and grace Thine intimations are, And second causes form but stepping-stones By which Thou marchest to Thy works, and ways. And o'er those waters of our human world, The ruder chaos of revolted hearts Still art Thou brooding, with Thy halcyon calm. For never, since pollution's blight commenced, And man apostate to his Maker turn'd, Hath sigh, or tear, or penitential groan To heaven ascended and God's welcome sought, But from Thy grace, pure Spirit! it proceeds. Then, are we lonely in the war of life Terrestrial? Strengthless, are we doom'd to strive With foes of darkness and with fiends of death, Who round the heart, and in the heart, contend? Perish the thought! The grace which Luther felt, Soldier of faith! is prompt to succour thee; Here is the haven for tempestuous woes And trials; port of sabbath peace to souls When the loud billows of temptation rise, And the heart trembles at their sullen roar. Oh, for a language, out of sunbeams made, In syllables of light Thy power to praise, Helper, and Healer of the heart alone! Sustainer truly of the sinking mind, Sole Paraclete to all, for sin who weep! Descend, and with the dewfall of Thy grace Our world refresh, a wither'd Church revive, And the hot fever of man's thirsting heart With healing balm of blessedness, allay! Without Thee, creeds become a barren sound, The Truth is charmless, and the Bible mute To conscience, though to mental power it speak; While all in morals, or in motive, gives But heathen polish with a purer name. And, where that shrine, the palace, or a throne From whence Thy secrets and Thy splendours flow! Where shall our hearts those inspirations seek Which make all Christians echoes of their Lord? Wherever man and mind, and scene and space May act or mingle, there, O Spirit! Thou With solemn fellowship the soul canst meet. What, though the herald-stars no longer glide To light the Magi; though no mystic Bush Burn with divinity in speaking fire; And by no miracle made bare, or bright, An Arm Eternal from the heaven is waved; Though shut the Vision, and the Witness seal'd, Nor Voice, nor Thunder out of glory rolls This earth to waken,—still, Thy love abides; And the hush'd presence of the Holy One No bounds can limit, and no laws may bind From Hearts who seek Him, in their tempted hour. In cities loud, amid the hum of men He walketh; or in loved and lonely haunts Shaded and secret, where Reflection hies; On mountain-heights, by musing poets traced, In vales withdrawn, by melancholy shores Lash'd by the billows in eternal beat, In each and all God's whisper may be heard, And still small Voice through listening conscience steal. Thus, heaven with starry eloquence inspired; Earth with her scenes of grandeur, or of grace; Home's gentle magic, infant's guileless laugh And mother's glowing smile, a charm may prove Or channel, where His unction can descend Through soft illapses to our spirit's depths. But in Christ's temple, there Thy palace is, Spirit of grace! from Whom our glories come; Where symbols, signs, and sacramental powers, Anthems august and hallelujahs deep Attend Thee, and Thy ministries attest. And Thine, too, is that living Word which breathes Of truth celestial, when by prayer perused, The Bible! there we hail Thee on Thy Throne, The Urim and the Thummim of Thy power. Reader! thyself a God is reading now While thus this question of all questions peals, Art thou, like Luther, by The Spirit led, Or, art thou by some hidden Fiend seduced? Whoe'er thou art, this truth take home, and think! Two Spirits only for thy soul contend, The Good, and Bad; but now, alone is Grace Imparted; soon thy final sands will fall, And thou in moral nakedness shalt be To Devil, or to Deity, assign'd Through endless ages! Oh, that truth immense. This mortal immortality shall wear! The pulse of Mind can never cease to play, But throbs with immortality begun, Eternal from eternity decreed! Above the angels, or below the fiends, To rise in glory or in shame descend Makind are destined, by resistless doom. A soul may perish, but it cannot die: Immortal essence, 'tis from Godhead drawn, And, like that Source, unquenchable endures. But thou, calm Spirit of celestial truth! Thee may we supplicate our soul to save, And so renew it, till, resembling Thee, Our heaven commences ere the earth depart. PAPAL ROME. Three hundred years of beatific life Unbodied, Luther's living soul hath breathed, Since the last thunder-bolt of truth he hurl'd With hand, how fearless! at the heart of Rome. There, in that world where ransom'd minds repose, Where priests, and prophets, and the kings of faith Are gather'd into glory, and await A pealing life-blast which shall rouse the dead, The monk of Wittemberg his Master sees And worships, waiting for his destined crown. But, hath the world from sacerdotal chains Itself unfetter'd? Is our faith the free And pure, and prompted by the Spirit's love And guidance, soul and spring of saving truth, Light of all churches, and the Bible's Lord? Alas! we slumber; and a carnal rest Calmly around us lets the chain of Rome Wind its dark coil, with most consummate ease And falsehood. Bloated with our self-esteem, And panoplied with intellectual might, At ease in Zion are we; while a Foe Remorseless, dragon-eyed, and unappeased, Wakeful as ever, watches for the prey Apostate weakness for Her fang prepares. We want a Luther, with a dreadless voice To front our modern antichrist, and face The Vatican, with all its veil'd array Of marshall'd doctrines or of muster'd lies. So might we bare the heart of blushless Rome, And rouse brave England's execrating voice Till back the priesthood to her dens recoil'd; While pope, and pop'ry, with a palsy smit, And scared by scripture, would for ever shrink In coward gloom to convents, and to cells, Hooted by nature, and by freemen hurl'd At once from virtue's and from reason's throne. Oh! that our protest were as brave and pure, As saints and martyrs sent, in olden time, From their deep hearts against the Man of Sin. Oh, that in light from flames where Ridley died, Or Cranmer suffer'd his immortal death, The Church of England would her hist'ry read, And ponder as she read, with eye of prayer; Till in that light her lethargy awoke And rising, like a giant from his sleep Enchanted, back the Romish chain would fall Dissever'd, from her limbs of glory dash'd In horror! Then, again that trumpet-cry, That battle-voice magnanimously bold, The tocsin of a nation's truthful mind By heaven excited, would once more be heard Like moral thunder round the seven-hill'd Seat Of Antichrist, in peals of dauntless power,— No peace with Rome, till Rome make peace with God! But that bold spirit, which in martyrs burn'd For truth and freedom, and our British name Laurell'd with ever-blooming praises, sleeps In dormancy most fatal. Thus the Beast Apocalyptic, once again his head Of treason, and his horn of vengeance lifts, To smite the Nations, and our Church eclipse With papal midnight. Yet, his outward mien Is stern no longer; smooth'd by modern hands To gentleness, his ruffled hairs relax; No savag'ry his watching eye reveals, And all his claws of cruelty are cut; But still, the Beast is changeless! for his heart Unsoften'd, throbs with blackest hate within Deadly, and dire as in the days of blood. Full well the Mother of deception suits Her face, her features, and exterior form Chameleon, as the atmosphere requires. And now, when learning, science and the Mind From dismal orthodoxy's Bulls of death, And blasts of excommunicating ire Shrink with disgust, sly Rome the hint receives! Till, like the echo of all wants and wills, Behold her! with the freeman talking free; With tyrants, she at once can tyrant act; And for idolaters gives idol-forms In saint, or Virgin! Whatsoe'er the creed Political, she finds appropriate tones And flatters each with some obliging key. Thus for opinion, passion, low desires, All tempers, dreams, imaginations, thoughts, All moods, and morals,—whatsoe'er the man In learning, commerce, or in life be found, For each and all can Romanistic craft A seeming counterpart affect, or frame; But, deep at centre, antichristian still! So works the Myst'ry, and the world is won, And aspect changed for principle reform'd Is now mistaken. Hence, for time prepared, Rome meets all pressure from without enforced, By powers elastically prompt within; Responsive always to each varied call From creeds perverse, or crisis which demands Her weapon'd skill, her wisdom and her guile. “And, why hath God, the merciful and great, Rome's vile burlesque of christian truth allow'd?” Perchance that Contrast may the earth instruct: And hence, when man and world have both been taught Their impotence; when Art, and Lore, and Skill Their powers have tried, all moral engines used To lift our nature from the gulf of sin, And tried in vain; when Reason thus hath learn'd No remedy from mortal wisdom comes The plaguing leprosy of sin to heal, And hearts apostate all their vileness know, Descending Thunders from the Lord Himself On Rome will burst, and ruin bury all! Hence from the first, eternal war prevails Against “The Woman,” and her seed elect; And each high plan supernal Wisdom chose Satan hath mimick'd with his aping guile, Or art stupendous. But the master-piece, The dread hyperbolé of daring skill, That great conception where his glory shines With blasting lustre, is the Roman mock! There, falschood in the garb of truth is found; There, darkness in a dress of light appears; And all the many-chamber'd mind can hold Of lies which lull, or sophistries that please, Is met, and answer'd by some prompt reply. No! not a tone which Character can sound, Without an echo from some chord of lies Play'd by the master-hand of popish Art! Till, that which blood and havoc could not do, When heathen Rome, or Arian butchers tried The Church to mangle and her creed to mar, This arch defection in canonic guise By Him erected, hath for cent'ries done! No partial error, out of reason framed, Nor falsehood, from licentious will begot, Hath Satan, in the Man of Sin, achieved; But one great bondage for essential Mind!— A ritual net-work, where the soul is caught, And co-extensive with its ev'ry power. Thus, all of tendencies, or truths which rise By man or time develop'd into sway, These, by a process of absorbing guile, Rome with herself in soft alliance blends; Can with her cause incorporate, and mix, And thus transmute them out of social forms To fine activities, whose friendly sway Is won, and wielded for her own at last. A CHURCH BY INVERSION. But, whence the model for this curse immense, This boundless magic of a baseless creed For ages, like an incubus of hell O'er human spirit brooding? Whence the power Bewitching, far beyond destruction's range? Why, 'tis a counterpart; a church reversed, A mock of Satan by a man inform'd, A mimic Show of what in very life And lustre, form and glory, should the Church As ground and pillar of the truth, have been. For, had she constant to her First Love proved, Binding on earth what God in heaven has bound, And witness'd boldly for her absent King A true confession, then would hostile Earth And Falsehood from her hallow'd mien have shrunk Self-blasted! and this o'erawed world beheld The Saviour's Body arm'd with regal powers, Mitred, and crown'd, in majesty supreme Anointed Priestess of all grace to man. But Satan copies, where he cannot change; And thus a parody in Popes contrived The Lord forestalling. Hence, the Fiend has framed A pageant hollow, where his plot can hide And act Himself beneath the Saviour's name. For more than haughty Rome assumes to be, By Heaven empower'd in privilege and grace Imperial, would the gospel Church have been, If holiness with apostolic charm Her shrines, her altars, and memorial rites, Her ministers, and members, all had crown'd. And here, (as ever) from the Plan Divine The lost Archangel hath, with fiendish craft, Directive elements of wisdom drawn. His model was Judaic: thence he stole Those adaptations for the sensuous mind He view'd there, organised in typic forms; Myst'ries and rites, or ceremonial laws, And ritual pomps where Priesthood looks sublime, He found prevailing: these he studied well, Then caught the genius of the mighty whole, And made a copy for the papal Church Which pope and priest, levitically blind, Transcribed for ages, and is using now. Thus, the dead carcass of Mosaic forms By God deserted when Emmanuel died, Satan himself hath repossess'd, and fill'd Or quicken'd. Here, the Roman witchcraft see! While man travesties what Messiah did, And writes “unfinish'd!” o'er His perfect Cross. Nor can our Age, though clad with self-conceit, And helmeted with intellectual powers, Produce the David whose predestined hand, With sling of scripture, and with stone of truth Well-aimed, her brazen forehead might indent, Blasting her glory, with a righteous blow. And, where the signs, the symptoms of Her fall? Whence come the weapons Christian arms can wield, Wherewith the triple Crown to pluck, and dash Her high pretensions into baseless dust? Alas! our locks of strength are almost shorn; Distracted counsels, or divided aims Impede fair union; and that mystic Robe Which all unrent in perfect glory hung While on His cross the dying Saviour bled, Is torn to tatters, underneath His throne, By hands and hearts schismatical, and wild! Is this an attitude for deeds sublime? With Masters many, while our Lord is One, Our cold negations can no Church evince In act embodying what our creed affirms Of Union vast, and visible, and true. How can we thus, with uncompacted force, And mere abstractions, depthless, dim, or faint, Battle with Rome, or keep her priests at bay? Alas! expediency our Moloch was, And at Her feet our ancient glories fell Dishonour'd. Mute that mighty Protest, now, By martyrs thunder'd like a voice from Heaven, “Come out from her, my people! quickly come:” Since base concession legalised her guile, And lo! the Land, whose soil with sainted blood Is hallow'd, where burnt Hooper's ashes sleep, And lived the lion-hearted men, whose tongues Shook the roused Empire with their shout for God, For faith, and freedom! there, the Papal “Beast” Is lodged, and in his den of lies secure! Yet, to and fro, behold! the many “run” And knowledge, as by Seers foretold, increase. Still, what though ocean, air, and matter seem A university for Mind become, Where Sense can study, Science take degrees, And Comfort all her sensual dreams enjoy, Is this protection from the spells of Rome? Oh! not in culture where no sacred germs Are planted; not by knowledge, where no peace, No pardon and no purity abound For conscience, not by these are empires great, A people glorious, or their welfare sure. VICTORY OF FAITH. Knowledge brings power; but Faith beyond it works, And out of heaven that promised aid procures Of mercy, whence alone true wisdom springs; Till, through the heart's regenerated depths The mind it reach, and make that holy, too. To catalogue Creation's works; the tides To balance; all the stars peruse; or scan The secrecies unveiling Science loves, This may enlarge, but not ennoble, Man, If man be measured by his noblest scale, By will, by conscience, and by perfect love, Love that is heavenly and by God begun;— For so philosophy divine asserts: We find the lovely, and that thing we love; But what God loves He thereby lovely makes. In these alone pre-eminently live Those elements which make our being great. But Things to master, abstract names to know, Their use, their natures, and their powers to wield, May serve the Body, not the Soul refine Or chasten. Thus, in vain would mental Power Self-deified, the world's redemption try. And how can mind, at best, a bulwark frame To fence corruption from the inner soul? In central likeness all men meet, at last; For there is conscience in the vilest left, With immortality, in each presumed; And this stern Guardian on his throne of truth Wakens at times, to vindicate the Law, And preaches on eternity and doom Sermons, which sound like arguments from God, Prophetic, deep, and terribly divine! And then religion, forced, or felt, or feign'd, The heart's convulsion and its craven guilt Alike demand: and where can earth produce A Creed so organised with subtle craft, To soothe the guilty, but retain the guilt, As the mock creed of pharisaic Rome? And though at times, pure Reason may rebel, Shock'd into anguish by imposture's lie, Reason is bribed, and understanding bought When Lust is flatter'd, or the conscience freed From harrowing guilt, from darkness and despair. THE MAGIC CITY. And thus, no energies from culture drawn, No arguments, by mental skill applied, The Man of Sin can weaken, or o'erwhelm: Rome laughs at these, and she has laugh'd before! And ev'ry realm progressive science haunts Pre-occupies, or masters at her will. Hence, what a paradox of wondrous crime, What miracle of permanence and power To men and angels, must Her hist'ry be! For though a slaughter-house for souls she made The Church for ages, still, without a blush She lifts Her forehead in the light of Heaven: And though full often have the pent-up fires Of wrath around her, fierce with ruin flamed; And Power hath tried, and Policy assail'd Her bulwarks; battles and rebellions leagued, Tyrants and victors have besieged her walls And daring Intellect opposed Her well And wisely; Truth and Science both have hurl'd The thunderbolts of their denouncing ban, While righteous scorn her hidden cheats unveil'd; And from the bosom of the soul hath burst, Time after time, Humanity's appeal Charged with the wrongs of ages, to condemn The blackest outrage which can e'er abase Morals and mind, and all which Man should be— The mystic Harlot, on her seven-hill'd throne In pomp and theocratic pride array'd, Reigns like a Priestess of the spirit still O'er crouching millions, in their souls struck blind! And find we not a symbol in the fate Of Rome the city, how the Romish creed All time would master, where the Cæsars ruled In blood, or baseness? Babylon hath sunk Beneath the blast prophetic, and become A den of ruin; Nineveh is nought; The Persian perish'd in his pride of arms; Assyria's dead, and Macedon no more; The daughter-islands of the ancient Deep Once free and faithful, in their noon of fame, With Tyre and Sidon, and the classic isles Of Greece and glory, are but sunken things; And Palestine, th' Almighty's home, remains E'en like a mother for her children dead, Wasted, and weeping in mysterious woe; But Rome is mighty in her magic still, Like man's eternity by stone express'd Behold Her! fated for a future doom, When Deeds by prophets sung, shall there achieve A destined ruin. Well may pilgrims trace In wonder, how august She yet remains! With fountains, baths, and famous aqueducts, Arches, and catacombs, and hoary shrines; While all the genius of dead Ages haunts Her soil with shadows, and her scene with spells That speak, though silent. Past and Present meet In high communion, and historic dreams Her tombs unlock, till colonnaded streets Move with stern Heroes, whose creative minds Yet bow the world with intellectual sway, Reigning like monarchs on each mental throne, Tyrants at once and teachers of the soul. THE MAN OF SIN. And as the City, so the creed endures Deathless in might, immortally depraved. Her aspect alters—when her power is weak; Her plans are soften'd—when her foes are strong; Her practice gentle—when the Age requires; But Rome, in principle, is Roman still The changeless ever! for her creed is one; And that is, to absorb the blinded world, And on herself a faith almighty found As truth infallible, or God divine! And what a miracle of matchless force She wielded, when the craven soul had sunk Down to that level, which her creed demands! Like to some vision of unearthly gloom Shaped in the midnight of a dreaming brain, By horror featured, doth Her sway emerge From the gone ages, when the Gothic mind Bow'd at her footstool, as the throne of God! Two Worlds she claim'd; o'er both presumed to cast The priestly shadows of Her sceptred power, Moulding eternity, and mast'ring time! Till in the glory of Satanic crime Her mitred autocrat almighty grew And challenged worship, such as God demands! Heaven's attributes in libell'd form a Man Did thus array: and when his frown grew black, It shaded all things with submissive awe And silence! On his lip creation hung; The elements from him their course derived, And plague, and pestilence, his law obey'd: His names were natures! and those natures all Ambition wanted, or his will decreed. But when his excommunicating arm Was lifted, Heaven that ireful threat revered! And Hell, with all its agonies and glooms, The motion watch'd: but when indeed it fell, Empires turn'd pale, and palsied Kings recoil'd, And sackeloth'd Nations trembled into tears! Yet had this tyrant but the body cursed, Made Cities mournful, or a province poor, Or, tax'd the Passions for an income base, Mankind were left some virtue, still, to save; But Nature, in her sacred ark of strength Where man is man when all besides decays, The Pope, by impious sacrilege, profaned. And dreader far than famine, fire, or sword, Dungeons, and deaths, or all which martyr'd Flesh Can suffer, is what outraged Conscience feels When, like a moral suicide, the Man Himself must abdicate, the will destroy, And not a Person, but a Thing become! Then rots the mind in servitude, and shame; The faculty august of reason fades, And blinded Nature grows a base machine By craft inspired, to work a despot's will. HOPE AND HARP OF PROPHECY. But, sheathed for ever is th' avenging Sword Of Godhead? Will it ne'er on Roman crimes And cruelty with flashing ire descend, Cleaving her bulwarks to their very base? Oh, dare we think, that all the mangled host On Alpine mountains hunted, spiked, or slain By thousands, or by Marian hell-hounds torn To bleeding fragments, have in vain their voice Heroic peal'd along the heaven of heavens, Startling the angels on their golden thrones When the last anguish of their dying lips Came up before them? Fruitless have they lived, Or preach'd, or felt, or suffer'd, who of old Gave to the world the glory of their death By wheel, or gibbet, rack, or fiery stake In vaulted cells of subterranean gloom By death-lamps lighted, where the lurid beam Faintly along some victim's quiv'ring flesh Glimmer'd, and lit his harrow'd features up? Far otherwise may thoughtful bosoms feel, When grateful Hist'ry to their shrines of Death Resorts, where deathless Inspirations glow. The living dead ones are they! and their words Ring round the heart like tones which never die. Beyond their sermons, preach their sorrows, still! Their anguish is our glory; for we feel, Who died for principle, for God yet lives To perish never! Where they bled, or burn'd, Corded, or chain'd, or rent by racking fires, Devils were taught how Man's enduring strength Can suffer, when by prompting grace inspired. And therefore, Martyrs! of Britannia's church, That ancient plant of apostolic growth, We laud, and love ye with no cold delight, Who bled for conscience, and to Britain left A creed untouch'd, like Cranmer's heart, entire! E'en from your tombs an eloquence proceeds Which champions Ages to repeat your worth: And never from our venerating hearts The deeds ye dared, the majesty ye show'd In the dread anguish of a godlike hour, Shall die! All time your holy debtor is: And long as in our Church's veins endures The precious life-blood of protesting truth, Never can England from her mindful soul Cancel the debt, her glories owe to you! Your pangs have her inheritance become, A wealth bestowing more than gold creates. Ye gave the Bible! which your tortures won; And shame terrific on our head alight, If what the blood of martyrdom bequeath'd In black ingratitude we basely yield. Ye gave the Bible! and that priceless Book Our blessings all in germ at once bestow'd. For, what is Science in her purest flights, With all those blending harmonies which rise From social nature, but the man evolved? But, both the moral and the mental roots Of human nature, with transmuting sway The scriptures reach; and thus with latent force And vigour these the heart of Britain cleansed, Making her land the paradise of isles. Then, not in vain, though Rome be blushless still, And round her creed a Trentine darkness casts Cruel as ever, have the martyr'd hosts And hecatombs of peerless saints, who bled For truth, to God against their murd'ress cried. Beneath the Altar rise their mystic wails And enter, not unfelt, the ear of Heaven: Since ev'ry drop their costly veins effused, With every pang their burning limbs endured, Have bright memorial in the Lamb'sown Book, And shall be answer'd, when avenging Time Brings the dread hour by Prophecy decreed. Then shall The Lord in robe of fire descend, And with the breathing of His mouth shall smite, And with the brightness of His coming blast, And into cinders by His curse consume Earth's second Babel, antichristian Rome! Meanwhile, presuming man would fain achieve What scripture to The dread Eternal gives In plan and purpose, for His crowning work. Thus, all are prophets to themselves, at least, And preach perfection possible below. But can corruption to itself be cure? If man be ruin, and rebuilt he rise, 'Tis not by rubbish from himself produced, But by a means transcendant, as divine. The creed within forms character without, And God alone can educate the will; But, will makes man, in all essential powers, And therefore must he, by regen'rate grace Beyond himself through heavenly love ascend, Or still be changeless, in his moral core. Thus, to the last, a leper will remain: The skin may whiten, but the blood is black, And burns in secret like a plague-spot, still. ROME SHALL FALL. And yet, 'tis written with a pen of light That Rome shall wither, and this Earth rejoice In the rich beauty of her bridal robes Apparell'd; and beneath her reigning Lord Keep the long Sabbath of a thousand years. And hence, millennial is the heart of man, As if 'twere haunted by some primal grace Of vanish'd Eden, when the Earth was young, Sinless, and bright, without one scalding tear To wet her eyelids, or the cheek to stain. Creation groans for her sabbatic peace; And echoing mind, in every age of thought, Repeats the longing. This the poet's lyre Hath warbled, in prophetic strains of song, Caught from the harp of Scripture; and the creed Of Aspirations, as they rise, and reach Their zenith, with this inward faith accords, That Earth shall bloom with paradise regain'd, And be unweeded of her thorny woes And thistles; and our Age itself is big With expectation of some golden dawn, Or peaceful glories. But alas! for earth, If no millennium save what science brings, Await her! if those moral truths sublime, That reach the Everlastingness of man's Dread future, have no room for reigning here: For, sooner may the hand of Science think To bale the ocean from its boundless depths, Than drain corruption from the soul of man! 'Tis here the worshippers of Mind, seduced By science, in their dreams half pagan grow, Politely bow apostles to the door, Or gently hint the Bible may be wrong! For carnal Knowledge to herself is true And constant ever!—back from God recoils Behind the tree, to eat forbidden fruit, Lurking, like A dam, in a guilty shade. But oh! Thou Spirit of celestial life And wisdom, teach them first Thyself to know, And, knowing Thee, themselves to feel, and find That man unchristian is embodied sin; And though embellish'd, and by art subdued, But veil'd corruptions all his virtues form Till faith can touch them with a spell divine. But there are prophets, who for Rome predict A downfall, not by arms of earthly might, Nor yet by reason, though its powers expand. Far humbler they: in things divine as deep, Jehovah is their reason; and they bow With faith compliant at that mental Shrine Where Deity, in human words, unfolds The future, and Himself to love expounds. And thus convinced, and by the Spirit taught That man with man can never right be made, Till right with Godhead will and worship be, Our true advancement by preventive grace Alone they augur. Well their natures know, That as the sun with his bright rays is view'd The living God with His own love we love. Hence in the organ-voice of Prophecy And chanted hymns by rapt Isaiah pour'd, They catch the music of Messiah's reign That in them warbles! But a wail there is, Or ever thus the gladden'd Earth shall lift Her choral triumphs, yet from man to rise: From seers august, from Enoch's olden time To him of Patmos, all their voice unite In diapáson terribly distinct; Denouncing woes, beyond what Time hath seen Or this world suffer'd, ere apostate Rome Be ruin'd, or millennial splendours reign. And though, by ardency of hope inspired, The distant future in fond dreams we scan, Enraptured, and those sun-gilt peaks admire, Deck'd by the radiance of a blissful dawn; Just as the mountains of our world appear In the blue distance, lined in lofty range And harmonised by one unbroken swell, With no dark gulf beneath them,—so may Hope Too often on the heights prophetic gaze, And merge, and melt them in soft unity; Though black the gloom, and dreadful the abyss Of wrath and judgment that between them frowns. A bridge of ages in prophetic time Our Dispensation is, by heaven decreed: Inclusively between those seers 'tis rank'd Who first Emmanuel in His veiling flesh Predicted, stricken, cursed and crucified For our acquittal; then,—the Christ enthroned Crown'd with the royalties of reigning pomp Millennial. Thus an intervening gulph The second Advent from the Church divides. And stern analogy this view confirms, When teaching ages of th' historic Past Instruct the Present, not for heaven to hope, But rather, that our Gentile sun will sink A bloody occident in wrath and gloom! And what a warning, would our ears attend, Nor deaf as adders from the charming voice Avert them, do the unforgotten scenes Where Churches, once which miracles endow'd, Apostles water'd, and the Spirit's grace Divinely freshen'd with celestial dews, Preach to the haughty Age we honour now! Where have they gone, those Daughters of the sea, Smyrna and Sardis, and the Sisters five Whose “Angels” oft the loved disciple taught? And by the shores, where oriental waves Chime their lone music to the Afric blast, How perish'd all Tertullian's page unfolds When Carthage made his apostolic crown, And martyr'd Cyprian into glory died! While Hippo, where sublime Augustine mused, Hath melted down to miserable nought! These give dread warning, if we wisely make The Past a preacher to our Present be. But, sick at heart, and in the head unsound, And sleek, and satisfied with all we do, The mountain of our majesty appears Immoveable! our age, Augustan call'd, Our arts advanced, our science most complete, Our wealth enormous, and our wisdom vast, On land victorious and by sea the same, While on our Empire sinks no travell'd sun!— Bloated with privilege, we thus predict Perpetual glory for the worshipp'd Isle, Above destruction, and beyond decay. SEVENTH VIAL SOUNDED. A Church elected, not a world renew'd, Here is the Centre for united aims; And faithful round it, touch'd by solemn awe Meekly and firmly may we watch; and wait Th' unfolding Drama of that hour decreed For vengeance, when the scarlet “Beast” shall fall; When He, in whom all types of terror blend And blacken into one colossal Form, The dread Fulfiller of prophetic woes And wailings, shall at last Himself reveal! The sin of ages into one condensed Shall thus be acted; then the Church endure That Fiend in flesh, of whom all Scripute shows Faint Antichrists, who cast their shades before The coming substance of infernal Might By Daniel vision'd, and by David sung In song terrific. Then, a Day of blood, Of burning deaths, of blackness and despair, All Creeds shall test, all living Churches try, Purging the faithful, till their dross they lose, And purified from out the flames arise In radiant beauty, and by love bedeck'd With bridal vesture to receive their Lord. And signs abound, and symptoms which escape All but the souls who see with Scripture's eye, That dooming hour by prophecy unveil'd, When Gentile churches shall dissolve, and end Amid the crash of Kingdoms. Far and wide, From Thames to Tiber throng the shadows thick Of terrors, which predict those Latter Times Ripe for the harvest of almighty wrath, When God for glory reaps His vengeance due. Look where he may, a watching Saint discerns No sackcloth'd Empire on its knees at prayer; No Kingdom bow'd in penitence, or tears; But all is headstrong, haughty, and unchanged As ever. Vainly have revolving Years Dread sermons preach'd on anarchy and crime To banded nations, or benighted men: And though Earth rocks, and Nature's foot-steps reel, Full on the buckler of Jehovah's wrath The Age is rushing, 'gainst His bosses dread To dash its forehead, and endure the death Of Treason. Soon, perchance, may come A dark catastrophe, which closeth all That fearful Drama, which this fallen world Is now enacting on the stage of Sin. The ancient Dotard of the triple Crown Is yet a mocker, and the Bible hoots Madly as ever; while absorbing Rome Beneath the banner of her witchcraft draws All warring opposites in creeds which rise, To swell her potency and aid her charms. Discord, and crime, and brutal passions rage; And Lust, and Rapine, in delirium steep'd, Weaken all truths, and let their lies abroad In lawless havoc over hearts and homes. And thus there rally, from the regions where Disturbing elements of mind can mix, All Powers and Principles, to final war. And by such phalanx, which a Fiend might lead To battle, when the world is well prepared, And leaven'd to the core with lying spells; When Faith, the bond of all cementing bliss 'Tween man and man, Her social life withdraws; And no religion to the Throne eterne Binds with a golden chain this earth below, Then may that Hour, by Luther's prescient eye Foreshadow'd, and by tragic Seers foretold, Come to a head, and Antichrist be scorch'd To cinders, by the thunder-blast of God! The Vials six have all been emptied now; The Trumpets six their peals of woe have blown, And of the Seals apocalyptic, six Their fated truths unfolded and fulfill'd: But when that Vial, for the seventh decreed, Its curse shall empty; when the closing Trump Hurtles its thunder through the mystic heaven, Then may this world an Incarnation see Infernal: such as never, from the deeps Of utter Darkness hath permissive God Allow'd upon our palsied earth to stand. But whatsoe'er this shape of Hell appears, As Wicked, Wilful, or the Lawless one, Myst'ry in flesh, or Man with fiend combined, Papist, or Heathen, Jew, or Pagan he, If not in name, by nature he shall prove Son of Perdition; who himself shall dare To magnify beyond all worshipp'd gods, Or Saint, or Angel, on his temple-throne; And rob the Infinite of glory due By lying wonders. Come whate'er He may In form, or fashion, faith in this exults, That in the wine-press of almighty wrath Trampled and torn, beneath avenging Christ The final Antichrist is doom'd to fall! For when awhile, on Satan's seven-hill'd seat The nameless Anarch hath his wine-cup drugg'd, And crush'd his compeers, till beneath his flag All Shapes of evil shall themselves enlist, Dilated, darken'd, and by deep excess Made terrible, beyond what terrors dream; When thus, fell Antichrist himself proclaims A new almighty on creation's throne! Then shall that Fight, whose dismal pomp arrays Full many a Vision with prophetic awe And many a promise with its glory fills, And many a verse with battle-music storms, Be hasten'd. Lo! the bright Avenger comes In panoply of dreadful glory sheathed, And blasting; till the disenchanted Earth Again shall smile, and with responsive joy Partake millennium in the Church's peace. ANTICHRIST. Yet, who can gaze, with spirit unappall'd, On the vast outlines of this coming Doom When all, which now in prophecy looks dead, Leaps into life and acts the part sublime! And this great Battle of Almighty God By visions pictured, lyric poets sung, And with whose muffled roar the Bible rings,— Who can presume its awfulness to paint? Then the Last Head of desolated Rome Under his banner, with his Kingdoms ten, And rebel Nations rallied at his cry, Shall, front to front, the God eternal meet For battle; and beneath the blast Divine Down the deep hell of darkness and dismay Descend for ever to his doom accursed! Dungeon'd in fetters, for a thousand years There shall He writhe; and in the racking curse Of judgment holy, shut and seal'd by wrath Resistless, magnify the Son of God, By this endurance of avenging doom. But yon bright Angels, who did faithful stand When He, the primest of their Splendours once, Fell in proud treason, by confirming grace In heaven to worship and on earth to wait Are destined; and their golden harps shall ring In unison with choral saints, who now Circle The Lamb triumphant and enthroned. MILLENNIAL VISIONS. As some pale Bard from fever-dreams awakes, Haunted by shades and shadows undefined Yet fearful, making dark imagination shrink, Once more to look upon a heaven of stars Through the high lattice beaming, and to bathe His wearied temples in the fresh-wing'd air Exulting,—so from these stupendous glooms And themes of awe, where Reason stands abash'd, Back to the brightness and the bloom of earth We hasten. Here, what living glories throng, Prophetic numbers might indeed rehearse; And vision scenes o'er which the harping Seers Enchanted roll'd their richest strains of song; And in some lulling dream of Latter Days For this world destined, feel what Luther felt, On Pisgah-heights of prophecy enrapt As oft he mused, and hail'd millennial times. But, now, expressionless the heart recoils!— Under a weight of glory melt all words To muteness, when that imaged Kingdom comes On earth to be, what thus the Bible types, And tells of Purity's celestial reign. Then shall Redemption's perfect work respond, And reach to all which revelation sings In forms of Matter, or in facts of Mind,— Yet to evolve. Creation's groan shall cease; And life, and sense, and earth, and air, and sky The vast enthronement of their Lord reveal, By the felt magic of His reign inspired And hallow'd. Glory in the sun will beam With sevenfold brilliance; and the placid Moon Glide through the mazes of her moving stars With lustre deeper than rapt David saw By midnight harping: not a fruit, or flower Which bares its beauty to the prying breeze, That will not in th' o'erflowing love and light Of Earth's millennial consummation share. And when Christ reigns, far more than Adam saw The Earth shall witness in this bridal hour. But oh! if Matter thus resplendent be, Who can pourtray inaugurated Mind? For if e'en now the Church our world instructs, Though in her weakness,—when with Christ she reigns Entire creation from That Church may learn Perfect instruction, in the things profound Of God. And as her Lord gradations knew, And to the heights of His predestined rank Ascended, so may God's elect advance By faint reflections of His threefold sway, As Prophets, Priests, and Kings of other worlds And systems; and this inorganic earth A palace of material splendours prove, Where Beauty visible its throne shall set, And o'er all worlds our own as model shine. Thus, on the footing of God's Word inspired Our hope we plant, and there this promise find, That throned Emmanuel with avenging ire Proud Antichrist shall blast, and then consume. The Jew shall yet his bright Jerus'lem see, And draw salvation from the Sides he pierced When Christ on Calv'ry bore the bitter Cross; While hymning Gentiles their hosannahs join The Lamb around; and resurrection-saints Call'd from the dust to greet their living Lord, A thousand years of coronation-bliss With Christ in glory shall on earth partake. Till when at length, on sin, and Satan's host And earth rebellious, final Judgment sets That Seal tremendous, which for ever shuts The perish'd in their prison-house of Woe And wrath unutter'd, earth and heaven shall reach A beauty endless, in baptismal fires Recast, and shine with more celestial bloom Than Sense can dream or Inspiration tells. Hence all creation will Messiah bring To full perfection, in its brightest form; And back restore it to the heart of God From whence it wander'd. There, his kingdom ends, And Mediation down its sceptre lays When nought between us and the Godhead comes. Then face to face adoring man will view The infinite; nor means, nor modes be used, Nor sacraments, nor teaching symbols cast 'Tween God and soul their intervening shade. In Deity the Church will be enshrined, His Attributes her perfect temple prove, Till God in mind the mind of God beget, And life eternal be Himself enjoy'd. TIME AND ETERNITY. Between the living and the dead our life Throbs like a brief vibration; and how soon This pendulum of anxious being stops! E'en in a moment, by some touch or tone Arrested, lo, the life of sense concludes, And we are launch'd beyond the tracking eye To follow; by the Infinite absorb'd, And in the secret of Eternity! And yet, as though Reality were here Alone authentic, how the hollow show Of things, which eye, or ear, can apprehend O'ercomes, and with monopolizing charm Our cheated mind attracts, and blunts the edge Of fine perception, for the spirit-world To come! And oh, how rarely hoping Youth Turns to the future a prophetic gaze, Beyond this earth of shadows! Tomb on tomb O'er life's descending pathway throws a shade; And many a heart-ache to some fever'd brain Must pay sad homage, ere the mocks of time Be scatter'd, and our nobler dreams of soul Their reign commence, and teach the gay to think. Then, throbs the immortality of thought Within us! then, adown the gulf unknown Of Life's hereafter prescient fancy looks, By faith made holy; while we learn to feel That body forms the prison-house of soul, And, out of it the dead indeed are free! And such are round us, in ethereal hours When earth recedes, and through the rents of Time Beyond the Visible we dare to gaze, And gather wisdom from a world unseen, Though not unshadow'd by foreboding mind. Thus may all clouds of Sadducéan tinge Dissolve, and placidly our dreams recall, And the loved features of our dead, recast! By lonely shores, by melancholy seas, At moonlight's trance, or sunset's dreamy close, Down vaulted aisles or churchyard's cypress-gloom Slow-pacing; or, beneath pictorial forms By Art's eternity of hues preserved, How oft we ponder o'er some face beloved! Till, by that resurrection which the heart Rehearseth, we can bid their cherish'd tones To wake, and hear their wonted footsteps glide. But, deep the truth omniscient Scripture tells And sanctions,—not one pulse of conscious Mind The Will Divine hath ever caused to play In human being, hath a single rest Experienced, since the primal throb began! The spirit-people of God's world Unseen, Millions on millions though their number be, Are conscious, more than when by flesh encased, And clogg'd in action. Not a soul's extinct! Still A dam thinks; still Alexander feels; Cæsar hath being; Cleopatra lives; And those crown'd butchers, whom the world calls brave, Are feeling more than when they battles fought: Yes, all who have been, great, or good, or vile, Patriarchs, prophets, intellectual kings, Heroes, or warriors, and those laurell'd priests Of truth, the poets of Eternity, All are a living, though a sightless, race; Each in himself a hell, or heaven, become! For Mind is everlasting; and the Man Is there in essence, when contingents die. Thus may the Dead a more than sermon preach To awe the living, and this truth impress, That as we die, for ever we endure! The same in principle the heart abides: Since Morals in their root continue one And changeless, though the Soul hath taken wing. Hence two Worlds claim us, by a sleepless law; But one moves round us, palpably instinct With life and passion; and, alas! absorbs In the wild vortex of its vain delight, What to the other, though unseen, we owe Of faith and conscience. Thus, for time we live As well as in it; thus, our hearts deny The Infinite that waits behind the Veil; And when the living from our gaze retire We talk as though they lived not, and were quite From Being parted, as to sight no more! Yet this is madness in the garb of sense; The blinding mock of necromantic dreams, Dilating time into eternity And which eternity to time contract. For faith and reason in this truth conjoin, The dead are living, but their life unheard, Unfelt, unknown, beyond ideal thought To image, seldom can that man inspire Who walks by sense, and worships but the same. PARADISE OF THE DEAD. Yet, thought has moments, when deep souls exclaim “Where are the Dead? the Minds who once look'd forth In light from eyes, in language from kind lips, And by the daring of immortal deeds Breathed on our own, like inspirations? Where Where dwell the Spirits, who once felt, and fear'd, Who dream'd, desired, or acted, like ourselves? Where have they fled? In blank absorption, lost? Merged in the Infinite, engulf'd, or gone? Melted to nothingness? Is this their doom?” Oh! wait awhile: for e'en as wintry earth By the green outburst of some glorious spring Secrets of heavenly power in Nature's breast Developes, so may this material Scene With hidden radiance of celestial life Be clad hereafter; since the reign of Saints Shall yet be witness'd, ruling over all Conspicuous, with a glory undescribed. The shell of Matter shall at once remove, Like a strange dream the Visible depart, And lo! at once the “quick” on earth will stand By angels circled, and by saints enthrong'd, And in the midst incarnate God appear! Meanwhile, the Bodiless in secret live Till all be rife, for this predestined form Of sudden, swift, and strange Apocalypse. Holy of Holies! in thy shrine august High o'er all heavens, ethereal, and unreach'd By man's conception, dwell the Dead redeem'd. There, the saved myriads of the seal'd First-born Present with Christ, from Him perchance acquire Truths which on earth Experience did not gain. Patriarchs, who dimly on the distant Christ Gazed in a promise, now with clearness look On Him they long'd to worship. Prophets, too, The meaning and the majesty of strains Mysterious, can by perfect thought expound; Types are resolved; and shadowy rites unveil'd; The mystic Lamb, on typing altars laid, And Gospel, by Aaronic priesthood taught, Their great Original doth here unfold And proves Himself sole archetype of all. While they, who died in dimness or dismay, Haunted by fears, and harrow'd to the last By many a tremor, in restoring beams Of comfort, look upon their Lord, and live. And there, is Concord! those conflicting notes Of human dissonance, which now destroy The solemn harmony of sainted minds, These can the Lord by melodizing grace Attune to oneness, till all souls agree. Hence, may that World where parted Spirits meet, A school of saintship for the Church elect Be found: there, The Lord His priesthood act, And God's magnificence of truth unveil; Or, more and more the merit of His Blood Teach the bright Spirits, who around Him throng. And thrill they not, from Christ Himself to learn His wounds, how deep! His mercy, how divine! Till round that Saviour rapt hosannahs rise, And in the minstrelsy of heaven we hear “Worthy the Lamb! for He was slain for us,” Through the deep ages of eternity Swell like a torrent of melodious praise. FAREWELL. And to this world, around whose vision'd scene Our thoughts have trembled, Luther's wearied soul Advances; soon will that tried heart repose In peace, beyond the loudest blast of time To ruffle. Twice some thirty years have delved Deep on his open brow their wrinkling trace; And often hath he died in thought, and pray'd At home with Jesu in yon heavenly clime To have his welcome! Hopes, beyond man's world To wither, far above the earth have borne His spirit; in the balance of the truth Its visions and its vanities he weigh'd, And found them wanting! Warn'd by heaven, he waits A kind dismissal to his last long home. For there, how many have before him fled, And seem to hail him from their thrones of grace Celestial! 'Tis not, that proud murmurs rise From out his noble spirit; but the hue Of Life's pale sunset, whose foreboding charm O'ershades the present with prophetic gloom. Youth with the living loves gay converse bright; Age with the dead can high communion hold, Nor calls it mournful, when the graves unclose Their treasures, or departed friendships rise; While votive Mem'ry drops the tear intense By Feeling gather'd in some aged eye! And such, perchance, within the pensive gaze Of Luther glisten'd, when in hoary eld That home he enters, where a foodless boy Through Eisleben from house to house he sang For bread! and dropt unseen the bitter tear Which moisten'd it, when cast from churlish hands. There, at his window, on the wintry heavens Bleak with the blast, and white with flaking snow, Dejectedly a thoughtful gaze he fix'd, While heaved his spirit with a swell of prayer By man unheard, but audible in heaven, Where thought is utt'rance. On his frame o'erbow'd Chill age was falling; and both languid nerves, And feeble sense, a boding symptom gave How soon with him the silver cord would loose, And bowl be broken at the fountain-head! But not for this repined he: for the Church He sorrow'd; and her doom with tearful eye, Foretold, as witness'd in the war of Creeds Around him raging. Thus, an autumn-tinge Sadden'd his future with prophetic shades Of woe and weakness; till, at times, he long'd Like Simeon, now in solemn peace to part, And on the bosom of his Lord expire. His work is done; his warfare is complete; And from eternity there seem'd to sound A bugle-note, that summon'd his retreat Home to the heaven salvation's Captain won. And what a world of undeveloped thoughts That moment of mysterious calm contain'd! As in the centre of all boyish dreams And hours departed, there he mused, and pray'd; Or the long windings of his wondrous life Haply with tears retraced, with sighs renew'd, And God in shade and sunshine equal saw, Guardian, and Guide, and Glory of his days Perpetual! Like a fated life had been The vast experience of his varied course, From lowly nothing to that Alpine height Of fame and influence, where his manhood climb'd, And age was resting: scarce had patriarch's dream Or prophet's vision more of strange and stern And awful, in the things of God beheld Or suffer'd, than the Saxon monk endured, From faithful Enoch down to fearless Paul! For, when had God His imprimatur put With brighter proof, than on the boundless Work Which now o'er kings and kingdoms, Man and Mind, Breathed of brave Luther, wheresoe'er it came? Sinful, indeed, before That Eye he felt, In Whose bright ray the heavens unclean appear; But faithful to his Lord, and creed, and cause, Mercy had kept him; and to Him he gave The crowning merit of the mighty Whole. 'Twas thus a charm of retrospective peace Besoothed him, when he felt no dread reproach From craft, or compromise, o'erwhelm'd him now. Firm had he lived, and faithful would he die, In life unblemish'd and in death the same! CHAMBER OF DEATH. And if the chamber where the humblest yield The burden of their being up to God, Down to the roots of tenderness awakes Affection's nature; if the feeblest Saint Who hovers on the precipice of time, When beetling o'er Infinity below Takes to himself some attributes, which speak Of awe and grandeur, can we gather round The bed of glory where a Luther dies, Nor feel an inspiration? Can we mark That eagle-spirit, from its chain unbound, In light and liberty o'er this dim world Escaping, nor a solemn thrill partake Speechless, but how expressive! There he lies! Pale in the swoon of swift-approaching death: But mind is yet majestic; and his eyes From the dark lustre of their burning depths Yet flash with meaning, and the soul express Conscious, and clear as ever; while the lips Move with that verse, which on Messiah's once Quiver'd in peace, when David's words of faith Wing'd His worn spirit to the Breast of God. Deeper and deeper now the shades of death Around him close, while drop the fainting lids O'er his sunk eyeballs; thickly heave and fall Those panting breath-gasps, while the ear of Love Drinks with delight some shatter'd tones, or sighs Of Bible-promise, or those falter'd notes Of Faith, which tell the spirit-life within. The strife is mortal, but the strength divine That meets it! Death all stingless, and the Law All dreadless,—neither can from Luther's heart Hurl the high confidence a christian seats There on its throne of evangelie truth. Around him friends, and mourners, each with sob Half-stifled, and with tears which hang unshed On the still'd eyelids of revering love, Are group'd; while bands of waiting Angels watch That mighty Spirit into glory pass! Cold is the damp which dews his whit'ning brow, And pains convulse him with continuous rack; But underneath that palpitating flesh Calm lies the soul! in peace celestial bathed, Though clay and spirit sunder. Hark! again The last weak cry of ling'ring nature lifts A dying homage to the Truth Divine, And then, on yonder kneeling forms and friends Before him, falls one faint and farewell gaze, And,—all is over! while his features fix Their pale expression into placid trance. No sigh is heard; nor groan, nor shudder comes; But wordless, and with hands devoutly lock'd, And mute as monumental Prayer, he lies, A dead Immortal deep in glory now! How hush'd, how holy, how intensely rapt As though the blood would listen as it flow'd, Till the brain rocks, and check'd emotion reels, That moment is, when first mysterious Death In full development his form unshrouds, Solemn and stern! And there, yon reft ones bend Moveless, and pale, like shapes of sculptured Woe O'er breathless Luther: each, by curb of thought, The big sensation from outbursting cry Restraining; not a tone of anguish breaks The silence; speechless on his brow they gaze; So still, that breath most audibly intrudes; And each can hear the living heart-beats play O'er his beneath them, pulseless, and at peace. Behind our veiling drapery of Sense Baffled we are from darting forth one glance Of mental knowledge; or the heart, methinks, Might dream, when Luther's disembodied Soul Pass'd from the flesh to join the spirit-throng, The inner-world some vast impression felt; While the high Dead, by heaven-born instinct moved, Rose from their thrones, to give him welcome due When first He enter'd their elysian scene. Tears are the litany of weeping hearts When heroes vanish to their native heaven; And let them consecrate an hour like this, For there th' Elijah of the Gospel lies! And rarely to the spirit-clime hath fled From this low earth, a loftier soul than he, The lion-hearted Luther! Never more That princely mind with gen'rous pang shall bleed: He sleeps in Jesus, but he wakes to God Chanting in heaven the song on earth he sung, “Worthy the Lamb! for he was slain for me!” The race is o'er; the goal immortal reach'd; Servant of Light, and vassal of its Lord, Him hath the Master with the host above United, call'd, rewarded, and resumed Back to the Bosom whence his graces flow'd. And let the pope and priest their victor scorn, Each fault reveal, each imperfection scan, And by some fell anatomy of hate His life dissect, with satire's keenest edge; But still may Luther with his mighty heart Defy their malice, though it breathe of hell. If soul majestic, and a dauntless mien; If faith colossal, o'er all fiends and frowns Erect; if energy, which never slack'd, With all that galaxy of graces bright Which stud the firmament of christian mind, If these be noble, with a zeal conjoin'd Which made his life one liturgy of love, Then may the Saxon from his death-couch send A dreadless answer that refutes all foes, Who dwarf his merit or his creed revile With falsehood. Far beyond them soars the Soul They slander; from his tomb there still comes forth A challenge, which rebukes them by its power; And the brave monk who made the Popedom rock Champions a World to show his equal yet! “DEAD, YET SPEAKETH.” Luther is dead! and like the Church's knell Sounds the sad tale in Europe's startled ear: Princes are thrill'd with consternation's throe, And trembles now the Reformation's ark! But, turn we most to see Melancthon's tear Sacred as ever dropp'd from friendship's eye. Nations alone the great Reformer knew, But he the Man had loved, and mourn'd him thus As David over Jonathan bemoan'd, Passing the grief of woman! 'Twas th' eclipse Of earth's best sunshine, when his Luther died: For years had tried them with severest test, And at each close, more fervidly in faith Had left them: therefore, what but soothing Heaven The dismal tumult of his harrow'd mind Can hush, and soften into sacred calm? Theirs was a friendship, which no earthly soil Can generate; from heavenly seed it sprang, And bloom'd unwither'd, 'mid the blight and blast Of cold earth's changes. Each to each a grace Imparted, which, apart, they did not wield. Their light was varied but their love was one; And the mild discord of commingled souls In friendship made the harmony more sweet: While o'er the failings of their mutual hearts A garment of sweet charity was thrown, To hide them. Thus, harsh Luther in some mood Tempestuous, when a lawless rage ran high, From mild Melancthon forced no bitter tone; For soon that tempest of a moment sank To loving silence; forth the rainbow smiled! And rich good humour cast its rosy gleam O'er the brief gloom a frowning word begot. And thus 'twill ever be, when hearts are true As tender: frankly bold, and freely plain, 'Tis not in nature when by Christ endow'd, A smile forgiving from a fault confest To hide, since love is here our holy creed: And kindness forms a talismanic key, Opening the heart well-lock'd to all beside. Luther is dead, and lone Melancthon weeps; And, reader! hast thou no responsive tear With his to mingle? Is thy gone career Tombless? And over no departed friend Heaves the green turf? Or is thy present hung With no sad cypress for a perish'd joy, Or faded dear ones, into dust relapsed? Alas! the heart's Necroplis is filled With many a tomb by Mem'ry's votive hand: And, where is he, that prodigy of joy In age partaking all his childhood had Of household-blessing, or parental bliss? Oh! long ere wintry years the head have hoar'd, Or thoughts their furrows in the forehead plough'd Eternity with time at least divides Our friendships. Heaven has oft the better half Of hopes which brighten'd, or of hearts that blest Our Life's fair morning! Soon the world grows strange; And bleak and barren do our pathways grow As more and more they wind us to the grave. And well, if friendship only be the loss We suffer; oft, our noblest feelings die; The heart is bankrupt, though the head be rich, While all those young simplicities of soul Which lay on character's expanding buds Like drops of morning, in their freshness bright, Exhale, and leave an autumn-waste behind. Not such were thine, Melancthon! Round thy grief A radiant hope of sweet re-union there, In that high world of fearlessness and truth Where all of heavenly which on earth we lose Again shall greet us, and a glory wear Perfect and bright, beyond our purest mind Below to witness. There, shall friend with friend And babe with mother, son with sire, renew In blest revival, unforgotten love. Partings below will soon to meetings turn, And serve, as foils, to set their gladness off Hereafter, when the soul's embraces blend. And there are moments, mystical as deep, When time anticipates eternity, Making the Easter of our mem'ry bright Rise on the heart, with resurrection-bloom. Bodied and bodiless can thus converge Whene'er to worship at The Throne we bow, Or sigh, or speak some lonely prayer of love. Soothed by soft dreams of well-remember'd times, There round that Centre of our common Lord The dear and dead ones of the heart revive; Inhale together a surpassing peace, And bathe their spirits in one blended joy Supernal: friendships thus in soul remain, When tombs have swallow'd all the senses clasp'd. So can the living with the dead commune, And rob the grave of half its vict'ry here, While love in Christ by sainted hearts is proved On earth the brightest, as in heaven the best. JESUITS AND JESUITISM. I.—MIND IS POWER. Mind is the centre of our human power And action: 'tis that throne of secret law Where, like a monarch, reigns the regal Will Supreme in orbit. As this living world Of varied substance, through its moulded forms And functions, hath each primal source of change Not in the region of created strength, But rather from the will Almighty takes Each plastic motion, so that time-bound scene Where man's embodied agencies unveil His vice, or virtue, good or evil acts, Not from brute matter, but from conscious mind Derives mutation, destinies, and deeds. II.—SENSUAL DOUBT. Yet, blind in soul, with sensual chains begirt, The fettered victims of the senses five In Matter place reality, alone! Effect remote, contingent and involved, Their view confounds, and is for cause mistook: As though the mind a passive myst'ry were By words created, not in things contained. But 'tis not thus! All motion, power, and change, Materially in heaven, or earth, or air Unfolded, seen, or heard, or felt, or scann'd, Up to the Mind Eternal must be traced As their last Root, and secret Law alone. III.—WHENCE CONDUCT SPRINGS. Thus Mind, not Matter, is that seat and spring Whence nature, providence and grace evolve Their vital actions, on our sense impinged With frequent pressure. Thus in Science, too, Where through the medium of material acts Wonder on wonder to her Priests unfolds Amazing products, and mechanic force Unbounded, high o'er all a Power presides In secret; graced with philosophic name, Men call it law, but what is law but mind In ruling action? 'Tis the Will Divine That, self-enforced, invisible as God, And shapeless as eternity to thought, Masters all Nature, moulds her myriad forms Of growth, or grandeur, and the world empowers. And hence, what Wisdom learns when most her grasp Into the oneness of a glorious whole Hath organised all forms, and facts of Life Material, is to know her ign'rance more. For, laws in Nature are our modes of thought, Our vast conceptions of the unreveal'd In matter, on whose aid all Science rests And reasons: but no explanation climbs That altitude where Law in essence dwells. What God to faith, that Principle to sense Becomes,—unseen, but actual, vast and true, And yet, from sense how infinitely hid In depths unfathomed! like the modes of grace, Those methods deep, whereby The Spirit wields His inward spells o'er all the central life of Man. IV.—REAL AND UNREAL. Thus, matter is the instrument of mind, And mind, as monarch, over matter reigns With secret magic: thoughts are throneless kings, Yet, thrones must wither, when their potent sway Becomes imperial! Then, the slaves of sense Unlearn the lesson brutal science taught Mere flesh to credit,—that the True Is what we witness, handle, taste, or hear; While Unreality to that belongs Which faith hath canonised, as law and life Supreme, by reason loved, and conscience own'd. But this, how baseless! Power to mind pertains: Reality within the realm of thought Abides; and (what from sense is far remote) Those lone Abstractions, which a lofty Soul Visions before it, ponders o'er and proves, Are oft the Factors whence our work-day life Derives expansion, and more blest is made. And not more truly can some Bard adapt Poetic language to melodious thought, Than to the process of those laws mind-born Within us sanction'd, God this outer-world Hath framed, and fashioned. Thus, the most abstract Creator, who from sensuous earth retires, While from her watch-towers Speculation eyes In stillness what ideal problems prove, Is no fanatic: for, resulting products show That what pure Thought conceived, creation-laws Hereafter realise; and hence attest How facts in mind to forms of matter fit Their truth, and justify what Thought foretold. V.—THE INNER WORLD. The Student, thinking in his mental bower, Pale, and apart from all our blinded World Calls useful, what a mock such man beseems To Mammon's host, or Belial's pamper'd slave! His world is secret, soundless as the soul Which doth create it; one of perfect mind. There, Truths in transcendental glory reign Harmonious, which are yet by words uncloth'd. Weeks, months, and years, that Devotee of thought Works like an Angel, with a perfect will To his pure toil surrender'd. Time and scene Affect him not; gain and pleasure pass His heart unheeded; passionately wed To some high Problem, life unliving seems From that divorced: 'tis health, and food to him! Thus the whole man, in body, soul, and strength A sacrifice to this achievement made, Now to the world-wise half a maniac grows! Or dreaming martyr, whom the moon affects With visions mad, or theories befool'd. But Genius is a prophet, priestess, queen; To speak, to sacrifice, and reign Her glory is, while inspiration bears Her being up; and so, the world she braves: And in those solemn agonies of thought When brain o'crtask'd becomes a thinking fire, And flames the blood with fever, still endures That strong resolve, which makes a Will sublime! And lo, at length the goal of mind is won, The problem work'd, the grand result obtain'd; And deep abstractions, such as Newton seized, Kepler embraced, or Galileo scann'd Alone, prophetic Science thus can bring Down from the heights where speculation soar'd, To grounds material,—to that homely soil Where life and commerce, man and income blend, Or struggle. Now, some calculus is got, A truth unveil'd, or principle applied Which moves the World for more than centuries on! And they, that scornful host of sceptic hearts Who mock'd the thinker, while creative thought Was all internal, when 'tis robed with fact, And 'mid the homes and haunts of life appears Embodied,—let them now that Lie abjure Which makes unthinking sense the Lord of soul! For mind, not matter, is the king of men, That salient centre whence our human world All change, and crisis, law and movement takes. VI.—HISTORY IN MAN. Coil'd in the secret folds of some vast Mind, Working unwitness'd, save by God's own eye Which views a thought as we survey the sun, The moral Life of ages lies uproll'd. History unread hath there a virtual root And fountain: in that comprehensive Soul Empires, and thrones, and revolutions lie In principle! there, carnage, crowns and creeds, Battle and peace, commotions, strife, and change, Lurk seminally hid, for future sway Or active function. But, the shallow pause Oft at the outposts, where material Force Comes into play, or palpably unfolds Realities, to earth and space and time Apparent; yet the secret motive-spring, The life, the law, the impulse, and the power Which vivifies what men for History read, Is viewless thought, a state of will unscann'd. For years conceal'd, in mental depths contain'd, Some brooding impulse of the Spirit works, And thence, as from a pregnant germ, proceed Gigantic changes which a world upheave To glory, or in guilt and ruin plunge Its greatness. History is but man unroll'd, And man himself, but what the will prefers, By mental action, or in moral force Determined. For awhile, 'tis secret all! Unheard, unknown, the boundless Project forms And ripens; through ideal worlds of thought The lone enthusiast, day by day, pursues His great conception, then departs, and dies. But, having to some genial few his plan Discover'd, soon the speculation swells And strengthens; till, at length, by living force Develop'd, forth from out the mind's recess That viewless Energy moves self-revealed In shape historic; clothes itself with forms Material; into contact bravely comes With men and empires; human Life confronts In all its faculties and myriad spheres Of influence, such as reach the vital power Of Nations, creeds, and churches, oft recast; And now,—the flurried World recoils, and fears! A sudden palsy over kingdoms falls Mysterious; truths and principles are touch'd In essence; baffled Reason looks aghast: Amid the turbulence and shock of things, Chaos seems come! And mark! how blinded Sense Amid the crash of churches, thrones, and states Around it crumbled, learns at last to see That by a single Thought, this giant-world Is moved, as though a moral earthquake shook Both Past and Present, from their thrones of sway For ever! Yes, some vast conception lives, Which once was mind impalpable, and hid. Results material are but Thoughts array'd With formal being,—Soul and Will become Embodied, and for creed and conscience made Apparent, by the deeds they dare, or do; But still in essence what they ever were, As seeds and germs within creative mind Maturing, where the soul of History dwells. VII.—LOYOLA. But, did we crave a specimen, and type Embodied, how a single Mind can move Backward or forward, churches, thrones, and creeds, And on the motion of one mighty will History depends, when earth and hell are sway'd, Turn we to him, in whom combine and meet Passion and principle, which make a Soul Though single, like omnipotence to act On men and empires. Turn we unto thee, Ignatius! with that rich Castilian blood Rolling within thy veins its noble tide Ancestral, dreaming, daring, all on fire With mad devotion, from whose wondrous spell The glories of the Reformation's power Receded. Never to a Cause was chain'd A devotee, more passionately raised To heights enrapt of superhuman zeal Than was that flaming heart, when first it felt How Law, and Gospel, Heaven, and Earth and Hell, Sin, grace and time, eternity and truth, In one abysmal thought, The Church of Rome, Might be absorbed! And thus, to thee, that church A Christ impersonal on earth became A dread abstraction, thine almighty all! VIII.—BATTLE-SCENE. Beside the radiant Arga's rolling stream Rise Pampeluna's walls; around them group Hills of expressive grandeur, huge and high, Cleaving the crystal air of old Navarre With pendant summits, while a wooded vale Of soft extent beneath their umbrage smiles. 'Twas here, enflamed by chivalrous romance For deeds and darings, such as storied Gaul In Amadis for ever laurels, stood Fronting the beach, amid the clanging shock, And brunt and carnage of a siege prolong'd, The bold Ignatius! Ne'er hath poet's god, Or dream-shaped hero, show'd more daring mien And desperate valour; fighting in the rush And roaring tumult of a blood-stain'd host Firm to the last, this lion of Navarre Contended, till beneath a gory heap, Shouting the war-song, fell his wounded form O'erwhelm'd by numbers:—Pampeluna sank; Then, Gaul's proud banners o'er the towers high waved, And red with carnage streets and temples ran. IX.—RELIGIOUS IDEALISM. The castled walls of his ancestral sires Shelter'd the Hero; thus, with nerves o'er-strung Fever'd by pain, emaciate, worn, and rack'd Through bone and sinew, on his couch he lay In long confinement: but the soul unchill'd Burn'd in his being, with a martyr's fire Heroical and strong; and here the captive fed With vision, and with reverie sublime Caught from the legends of the sainted host, His heated nature,—till a sacred knight Sworn to the Cross and to the Virgin vow'd, Ignatius grew! and then, Romance began, Blent with disease, to madden and inspire His soul with more than passion, and “The Cross” Wielded a spell o'er his ignited heart Transcending human valour. Hence by faith Etherialised, from fields where Glory wins Laurels of earth, to scenes where Heaven rewards Her heroes of celestial temper, turns he now: And lo! in battle for the church of God, Founded on Peter, like a war-machine Against all heretics whom earth and hell Concentres, yearns Ignatius soon to fight! Here was a chivalry, whose new-born spell Beat like a pulse of preternatural force Fiercely within him! Visions, vast and bright, Surpassing all apocalyptic Seers beheld, Daniel conceived, or Chebar's prophet view'd, Hover'd and hung around him, night and day With their entrancing glories! Blood and brain Were fever'd; with such gorgeous fancies thrill'd. The very poetry of madness seem'd To shake stern Reason from her throne, And conscience to its roots. Then, fast and prayer, Penance, and vigils of enormous length, Blent with erratic dreams, together work E'en to pale death this champion of the church Devoted;—him to Mary ever vow'd, Mother of God, and Queen of grace-born Souls! X.—A DEVOTEE. While thus impassion'd, Salem's heaven-loved soil Before him glimmers; to that Land of dreams, Christ's home on earth, by His incarnate Life Eternalised, the new crusader hies. Alone, in all the flush of flame-eyed zeal, Sandalled by rope, with staff and calabash, Unarm'd, the wounded Pilgrim drags his way Till old Manreza's gates, at length, unclose Before him. Here, again before the throne Of worshipp'd Mary, fast and penance prove His knighthood, while he hangs his weapons up Before the imaged Virgin, and his flesh Devotes to torment in the monkish cell Of Dominic, that patron of all pangs Ascetic, which redeem the will to God Through shirts of pain, and thongs for bloody scourge! Never did Penance such a hero boast, As now was witness'd! Round his wasted loins Clank'd iron fetters; while some thrice a-day Fell on his frame the blood-absorbing lash: With bitter ashes was some barren crust Commingled; prayer, not sleep, the night Engaged; and on the stair of his damp cell A kneeling trance of seven-hour length unbroke He often kept, and starved his body down Till foodless life look'd death itself begun! Loathsome his garb, beyond what beggars wear; While underneath his gaberdine there lay Thorns, which might pierce with laceration slow The flesh abhorr'd! But still, the deadly work Of martyrdom in horrid climax fail'd! For now to cavern'd darkness lo! he flies A serried anchorite; there fasting, keeps His awful vigils, till the pallid gleam Which through some crevice of the rocky cave Glimmer'd, on his ghastly features play'd As though it trembled on such face of death To glisten! But the peace divine he sought, Was far as ever from his gasping soul. Then came the conflict! the convulsion dread Which, like a living earthquake, heaved and rock'd The moral ground-work of the man within Till mind was shatter'd, and the will no more! Voices, which seem'd from out Damnation's gulph To issue, yell'd around his inward ear; While visions, black as fiendish Magic forms, Floated within him, till he gasp'd and groan'd, Throbbing, as though the arch-fiend wrestled oft With his spent anguish! In that hour of hell When madness, guilt, impiety and dread Raged in the depths of his convulsèd soul, Dread Suicide beheld him on the brink Of lost eternity, about to dash His headlong spirit down the pit of death: When, lo! The Virgin, veil'd with robes of light, Floats in the air, before his eyes entranced Clasping her infant-God: and, thus recall'd From murder, straight with bare and bleeding feet To Salem must that wild ascetic come, Beggar'd, but not subdued, a Grave to seek, The Sepulchre most holy of The Lord! But ere he went, our Lady, to reward Her dreadless champion, back the heavens unroll'd Above him; more than Paul unbodied saw Ignatius witness'd,—what no words reveal! The Trinity to him unclosed its shades Of awful Wonder, whose mysterious depths To sight were open'd! Ages next, retired; And how Creation at God's bidding rose From nothing, and the motive whence it came, His awed imagination then beheld! And more than this the rapt enthusiast seem'd To image: an apocalypse of soul Did to his thought that spell of spells unwind,— How bread and wine are in the Host transform'd, And changed to Christ, when priested lips command A sacramental Incarnation there God to enshrine, and Calvary repeat! XI.—MISSION. By vision strengthen'd, and by faith sublimed To that fierce boldness which all Earth defies, And time, or torture, to absorb or tame, Nerved like a martyr, with his crown in view, Ignatius onward to the tomb of Christ Fearless of Saracens, advanceth near. When, Lo! again, a visionary Christ Hovers on high, above the blest sepulchral stone Featured with glory; calls him to convert The Orient, and His word of burning truth Thrills through the soul of this heroic man Like magic, out of Heaven's own music breathed. And now, the work is done; the dreamer ends! The cavern'd eremite no more exists Fever'd by fancies dark: all visions die, While calm Reality his heart ascends To reign in wisdom, and the world o'erawe. The giant from imagination's sleep Awaketh, what a wond'rous race to run! Yes, from the cloud-land, where confusion form'd Ideas, like a mental chaos wild, Down to the cold the actual and the stern Descends the dreamer, and is Man again! Before the sepulchre of Christ is born That future Jesuit, who the earth rechain'd To Roman falsehood; glorified the Pope Like God, and push'd the Reformation back For centuries, as some fallen Angel might Reverse by giant craft the Good abhorr'd. Nor ended he, till over ruin'd minds And reeling empires, through his master-spell, A vile theocracy of priesthood rose As if by miracle! where myriads bow'd Under his sceptre, like single Will By God struck prostrate through resistless law. XII.—THE VOW. The wings unfold of some three hundred years, And lo! a vested group of gather'd priests In mute procession, from beneath the towers Of Notre Dame there winds its solemn way On to the capital, which now reposed, Under the stealing brightness of the dawn Quiet, in square and street. But, hark! at times Peels in high cadence with a chanted swell Their orisons, as o'er the fame-crown'd heights Of Martre, to that sacred Crypt they move, Where France believes her first Apostle gain'd His crown eternal of celestial praise. Mark, in the front, with war-like mien, and gait Most kingly, He who leads yon priestly band! His countenance seems in itself a Church And Council,—grave, profound, august, Delved with the lines which deep reflection brings Upon the brow of Thinkers. From those eyes That blaze with intellectual fire, there dart Imperial rays, beneath a godlike front Which Painting loves to study. None could view That martial figure, and a King of mind Imagine not; for, look and step and air Betray'd his mission. He was born to rule, And in the world's great heart a crisis form Of glory, or disaster. Such appear'd That incarnation of religious guile Ignatius was, on more than empire bent, As on to St. Denys' memorial fane Of martyrdom, he leads his band elect. And now, when o'er yon sacrificial Bread The necromantic words of priesthood work That spell almighty, making God to be! Are duly mutter'd, hark, the direful Vow!— A vow, which, had encircling nations been Around them gather'd, might have palsied kings And kingdoms! 'Twas an Oath sublime, and stern; From each of that sworn brotherhood it rose Significant, and low, and deep as dread, Rising from man on earth to God in heaven,— In witness, they in life in limb and thought, In soul and body, reason, conscience, will, Prostrate before the Pope, would ever crouch Slaves of his will, in whom a Christ on earth Is worshipp'd, as the source of churches all! XIII.—THE SYSTEM. Such was the Man! and now, the System view Reigning victorious, realising all Its founder imaged, while He watch'd and wept In cell, or cave, on Tabor's rocky height, And grew a priest-god, by whose sceptre awed, Nations and kingdoms, churches, creeds, and states, All tribes and peoples, passive things became. Ere twenty years had vanish'd, what a world Ignatius wielded! more than Pompey dreamt, Cæsar acquired, or Alexander's heart Encompass'd, ere he died the Jesuit ruled. Luther and he were two embodied Types Of that great Problem, which the earth convulsed With doubt and danger,—how in one to blend The rights divine of individual souls By God created, and by Christ redeem'd, With that consentient law of common-life Incorporate, which a perfect Church demands. Luther for souls, as single, lived and died In battle; but Ignatius for the Church Contended, striving to engulph the Man As unit, in that Body of the whole Communion, where each separate life expires. XIV.—PRIESTLY TRIUMPH. Behold his triumph! In the convent veil'd By solitude austere, from men remote Like regal Grandeur, forth his genius sent A world-wide power, which Empires still obey! Europe, and Asia, and the far Brazils, With India's giant realms,—his sceptre touch'd Them, each and all! Thus, colleges and schools Rise at his wand, to regulate the homes And hearts of myriads: cabinets are moved; Kingdoms admonish'd: councils awed and sway'd: Battles commenced or sudden peace restored And strengthen'd,—all betray the master-soul Of this fam'd Leader. On his royal lip Law absolute depended; at his word Obedience rose, and where it will'd, there went His banded zealots,—brave and lion-hearts Burning for martyrdom, through East and West And North and South, the faith of Christ to plant; Making the desert with the rose of truth To blossom, and the wilds of sin to bloom With those rich graces which his Church admires! Nor did the magic of his subtle power Pause at conversion; since, to Him applied Monarchs for help, while queens for civic aid Besought Him: thus, by law divine he seem'd Lord absolute o'er thrones and kings to reign, Whose crown was genius, and his sceptre, mind. XV.—SERPENTINE WISDOM. Behold a system deeper than the thoughts Of ancient Despots, in their dreams of power, Fathom'd or framed, which now the world o'ertook. Luther and Calvin, when Ignatius rose, Had like a storm-blast heaved the mind and heart Of Empires; mental life and action spread With speed miraculous; monkish night dispersed, Like cowering demons by the gaze of Christ Daunted, and dazzled. Novelty awoke; The fountains of the spirit's deep were barr'd Or broken up; creation was abroad And active; while in science, creed and art Inventive genius with irruptive force Burst into sway:—and now, behold! the plan Both wise and wondrous, by the Jesuits work'd. Not to reverse by effort mad they tried The onward rush of European life; But through the prowess of exceeding mind Master'd its move, and led the mighty van Church-ward to Rome, while yet they seem'd to act And mingle with it! To suspend, or chain The giant impulse, had their skill surpass'd However subtle: so the lead they took, Absorb'd, embodied, gather'd in the whole, And guided that which else had govern'd them! XVI.—SPIRITUAL AGGRESSION. Thus they resolved a problem, dread and deep; How with pure faith philosophy can blend, Reason and science with religion act Their mental freedom. This they strove to show When Church and College, as two symbols, rose Together, and their union thus involved. Here is the secret of that Jesuit-work, Which won an awful triumph. Mark it well Student of man! for History hath no page More to arrest a Thinker, and his thoughts. To battle with the Reformation-power Forth to their work those weapon'd Jesuits came, And ne'er did such Machines of mental war And conflict, fight with their unearthly skill! Aggressively, with Nation Creed and Church They grappled; Science and mechanic Art, Language and Commerce, Poetry and Lore, How did they master each, and model all, Or shape them down to their dread purpose fit! Man and his motives, mind and heart they probed And scann'd, they search'd, anatomised, and knew Where to begin, progress, and how to pause In each career they ventured. Thus empowered, These champions of the Roman church became Resistless, by their secrecy of strength In action; back the Reformation quail'd Before them! city after city bow'd True Liberties beneath their wizard laws; Princes and people, by such craft inspired, Barter'd the conscience, till Germanic minds Which Luther ransom'd, into bondage sank Abased as ever! Rome again prevail'd; Darken'd the soul, and dungeon'd half the world Of free-born Europe in her creed and chains! XVII.—UBIQUITY OF GUILE. It looks romance, but solemn archives show What miracles were by the Jesuits work'd O'er man and mind, when first their princes waged Heroic warfare for the Pontiff's throne. Never was education so profound As their adapting genius, form'd, and plann'd, And carried out. But while such home-born minds Were foster'd, far and wide their missions spread From China's wall to Paraguay the wild, Or, where by Ganga's Stream the black Hindoo Waited for truth to set his spirit free. Nor paused they here!—in palaces and courts, In cabinets and councils were they hid And harbour'd; metamorphosed to all shapes, Ignatius seem'd self-multiplied, and ruled By their dark subtleties o'er plots and plans Tremendous, bloody, dismal, deep, and dire As Rome conceived, or policy preferr'd. Thus do we find, at infamous Versailles, The poison'd words of persecuting Hate Into the ears of Royalty distill'd With potency infernal, while true Hearts In Britain's court were basely undermined Or master'd; everywhere they move, And everything they touch, pervade and thrill; All places reach; all powers affect, or change: No person safe, no principle secure! From cot to court, from king to subject down, Their zeal can like an omnipresence act. Equal for them, to whom the Pope is God, All powers of State; all governments the same! Each to his Church is creature, slave, or tool; Crime is not criminal, when She commands The deed enormous! treason noble looks, And murder from the decalogue departs No more forbidden, should the Church require A splendid victim for her crown and cause! “A Jesuit!” well might childish dread conceive That Name far more than mortal nature clothed! Satanic wisdom seem'd almost surpass'd By them who bore it; guile and darkness there Concenter'd all which intellectual Fiends, On earth embodied, might for falsehood wield Were Pandemonium in the mind to reign. XVIII.—MECHANISM FOR SOULS. But if the ground-work of that guile intense And spell, whereby the man unsoul'd becomes Enslaved to priesthood, we desire to search, A Book behold, by right “mysterious” call'd; For here, mechanics for the Mind exist Which, when by crafty discipline applied And studied, render man a living corpse In spirit,—an automaton for Priests To mechanise, until The Church appears A thinking substitute, a faith-machine, And swathes the Will with swaddling bands which bind Men to obedience, passive, base, and blind As absolute! And now, de-natured man Sinks from a Person, and a Thing becomes, Depress'd and dwarf'd, a mass of featured clay Whence mental faculty and moral force Have been absorb'd! Yet, libel not that God From whom Humanity her birth derives, When thus impersonal, by calling such A “Man!” Spontaneous will and thoughts are dead, Or, sunk and swallow'd in the church of priests; Conscience expires; the mind can think no more; A soulless thing, an accident, or show, A mere Negation for a man mistook Is all that such mechanics for the mind Can boast of; but their ruling charm succeeds! The Formula of hideous falsehood works; Conversion by mechanical result In thirty days is certain, ere one moon Can vanish! Let the “Exercise” be used Completely; let each posture, gait, and groan Be duly balanced: let the dismal curse Of silence, solitude, and darken'd rooms Be wreak'd, together with an imaged Hell Shaped from imagination's horrid depths Of blackness, where the howling Fiends are heard,— Such let the neophyte of Priests enact, And lo, conversion! passive as a stick Wielded by aged pilgrims when they walk, Or helpless as a shrouded corpse, when moved By living creatures,—view the Convert now! XIX.—PERSONALITY DESTROYED. What God created thus a Priest destroys,— Man with a Soul! for now, that Soul reduced By such absorption, in the Church resolves Its nature: 'tis no more a choosing Power Or Person; stifled reason hath expired In self-renouncement; what is left, the Shape, But not the Substance, of a man remains. 'Tis but an Organ, made of sigh, and sob, and speech! Now on bare knees: then, prostrate in the cell Of anguish; now, for ritual drama garb'd And spangled; then, engaged in mumbling rounds Of words, where sense through repetition dies, Or the tired breath monotonously tones Ave Marias! till the lip-work dire Achieves its penance. What a boast is here! When thus a mechanising Priest can make Persons turn Things, and Things like corpses lie Passive and powerless: such the Jesuit seeks To govern, and despotic Rome demands. XX.—OBEDIENCE. Monster of systems is the Jesuit-school! Police and treason, accusations dire As dismal, each on each a dragon-watch Keeping incessant, so that counter-spies Thus exercised, a bosom-hell create. Suspicion lowrs on ev'ry guarded brow Of this dark Band, whose jealous eyes are keen, Prompt to denounce each alter'd shade of mind Assumed disloyal. Thus, the living pulse Of pure Emotion is by terror chill'd Or death-struck; social life exhales, And all enacted, is obedience now Under the yoke of thy cadaverous Rule, Ignatius! Fiends o'er such a scheme exult; But Angels, could they our dejection know, Might shudder, veil their eyes, and weep for Souls! CONFESSION AND CONFESSIONAL. XXI.—PRIEST IN OFFICE. Rome for the spirit a gymnasium proves: Her Priests are posture-masters for the soul Deluded, who can twist and turn the mind And morals, just as Superstition shapes Her ritual, or Effect on man requires. Seek we a proof for this satanic aim Of sacrilege on souls? Behold it, there! The wooden screen of yon confession-shrine Behind whose shelter lurks a probing Priest, Contains it. 'Twere enough to blot the sun At noon-tide blaze, to horrify the blood, Or make Humanity to blush and burn With shame eternal, might plain Truth disclose All which Confessional has heard, or done, Or vilely dared within the bosom's depth.— Laid on the rack of Rome's lascivious tongue The mental victim of confession sobs Tones which are torture, while the fiendish words Pierce their exploring way with foul success Or skill'd advantage, till the Heart is won And all the sacredness of soul expires. XXII.—DEATH OF PURITY. How the crush'd modesties of Woman bleed Under the hoof of man's inhuman speech Down-trampled! Mark that serpent-priest, Holding his ear, lasciviously inspired With loathsome appetite for all that should Be wordless, and in blushing silence sleep,— Feed on confession with his vampire-taste; While maid and mother, wife, and sister wring Their secrets into language, till their souls Are agonised at every modest pore Of feeling; wrench'd, as though infernal screws Tortured their silence to convulsive speech. Each gasping word seems like an oral pang Breathed into utterance, with a growing shame Which burns, and blisters, almost frenzies mind And reason. Hell itself might cry, enough! When a foul priesthood thus satanic grows. E'en as from flesh an Inquisition tore The limbs asunder, till each artery writhed, And gush'd the life-stream from the corded veins In drops of anguish, so Confession tears The spirit into torment, on a rack of words When some strain'd Heart is by the priest outstretch'd. Oh! how it quivers, till the soul half swoons With dread; and as the hideous work proceeds, Well may wring'd conscience tremble, start, and groan! XXIII.—INWARD MARTYRDOM. Nature hath no monopolist like man Unprincipled, to conscientious brute Transform'd by juggleries of Jesuit-guile. Through Her foul science for confessing hearts, Crafty as hell, and cruel as the grave, A very Sodom for the souls hath Rome Created; and, with criminal excess All crime exceeding, hath on Nature laid An incubus of everlasting wrong. True personality in mind inheres, Lives in our thought, and when that thought is gained The moral Person to the priest belongs Who holds it. Thus, Confession drains and draws The secret life-blood of a Spirit out By science; melts it with persuasive skill Into the mind of some mechanic priest, Who to his own assimilates the same By progress gradual, stealthy, sly and deep. Thus, mind confess'd is through the mouth transferr'd Into the Priesthood, which in turn reacts With fearful magic on that mental wreck,— Some whisp'ring martyr at his feet, unsoul'd! XXIV.—WOMAN AND HER DESTROYER. The shaping genius of a priestly tongue When so applied, can secretly impress On the soft wax of Woman's yielded mind Each vile impression, which a Jesuit loves Or sanctions. What a rav'ning lust of power Inhuman, must that papal Church corrode, Who God would rival, by discerning soul, And analyse its living essence down To system! Well may Superstition, mad As impious, dream the pausing Angels stand Respectful, when such priest-gods pass or speak: For, what they cannot, priested tyrants do,— Master the will, and mechanise a soul! XXV.—MORAL IMMOLATION. But ah! with all his power, let Pity weep For such a Being, by confession train'd. Fell must the heart, and foul his conscience, be By such a process! Enervate as vile His faculties become, who, day by day, And hour by hour, in study, thought, or scene, Woman and Hell before him must evoke For question, and for trial! Not for worlds With all their glory, ought man to command So foul a scrutiny, which scans and sees What yon confessor by a loathsome skill Must probe, and punish. Hark! 'mid choking sobs And big slow tears, that with a burning trace Scald the fair cheeks they moisten; or, with sighs Heavy as deep, by agony intoned, The Bride, the Mother, or a Sister kneels Before her priest-god. Heart, and home, and love, Secrets of thought and starts of young Desire, Each throb of Passion, throe of feeling wild By warm emotion in the blood or brain Excited,—all must sternly be exposed In language, by describing speech unveil'd! Ay, word by word, before that priestly Ear Be all paraded! When that fiendish work is done, An immolation of the soul complete Begins; for, moral suicide is wrought, And all we reverence in wife or maid By purity of sex, exists no more. The Woman dies when modesty is dead; Her heart is corpse-like, and the Priesthood reigns Most absolute, a soul within a soul Transplanted, ruling there with master-spell For ever: He in her becomes an all! XXVI.—EXISTING JESUITISM. Such are the Jesuits, that banded Crew Whom guile has disciplined, and genius arm'd. With secresy of power environ'd safe They war incessant on the souls of men: Malignant, dark, and merciless as deep In all their plans, their principles and aims Mysterious; Egypt's plagues in them appear Eternalised, by Rome's tremendous charms! Twice twenty times, although by prince or Pope Disbanded, such a mischief-power resides In their black Institutes, while friend and foe Repulse them, when some crisis rocks the church They show their treason in most damning shape Embodied; and, religiously depraved As ever, still their plotting Host endures! No crowns are safe, no kingdoms rest secure From these marauders; through all Lands they steal, And nothing touch but what they blast, or blight. Ubiquities of guile! from whom no spot Or scene, or time, or principle, or truth Or creed, or constitution can escape. Now, at the helpless populace they strike In secret, grinding down the People's heart To dust; and now, a King they serve, like God! All creeds, all changes, and all climes alike They vanquish: so that Rome can reign, Earth hell and heaven in their enchantment grow But names of sounding emptiness, to fear! The Babylonian Lady of the hills Who martyrs more hath made, and numbers less Than churches all, is their celestial Queen Whose cause they worship, and whose crown appears Jewell'd by Jesuits as the brightest gems. And, when the archives of a soul are read Under the light of Judgment, 'twill be found That home of heresy, the Devil's heart, Prompted by which schismatic Angels fell, Since time began, no hateful brood hath nursed Of human serpents, more intensely fit Infernal poison through seduced mankind To circulate, than this dread crew have been! XXVII.—ENGLAND'S PROTEST. Now therefore, Church of Britain's ancient growth And grandeur, from the Jesuit guard thy creed! That anti-trinity of scheming hell, The Beast, the Dragon, and the Prophet,—rise Around thee; lo! the final conflict draws Nearer and nearer to that bloody close Where crime and havoe, heresies and wars Clash in the fray, and worse than chaos comes, Till palsied Earth shall palpitate with dread And downward ruin! Free-born Isle of saints Heroical, whose dust hath been sublimed By martyrs! peerless Home of loyal hearts And high-breathed virtues, God on Thee devolves A vast prerogative, to utter, No! When priested blasphemy this lie propounds,— That Rome's Melchisedec is God's ordain'd Vicar on earth for Christ in heaven to rule. Sublime negation! let it never end My country; far as pulse of man can beat Utter it forth, unsilenced and unshamed. Rooted in scripture, let thy Creed remain; Protesting, therefore catholic and true, And catholic, because protesting found. MORAL RETROSPECT. Nature alone, is universal want; Yet how to fill it, Man can never find Till Heaven instruct him. Sin a gap hath made, Which all the glory that below the skies Our dreams may image, or some vast desire Adumbrate, cannot now conceal, or close. The happy are the holy; none besides! But, God in man plants holiness complete: Life from The Spirit, by His Word inbreathed, Like to a soul within a soul must reign Or, at the best, Humanity corrupts; Her lights are cold, her attributes eclipsed, And all her high prerogatives a cheat. Still, man himself a moral Crœsus thinks, And by his power perfected being longs To frame, or fashion. Hence the World has tried The hunger of his heart with food to feed, Drawn from the depths of that presumed supply By Self created: but the effort fails; And Time recorded yet repeats the tale Of mutual wants, by mutual pride befool'd With false supplies, which took the name of Good, But never reach'd its nature: till at length Giants in faith, by God himself equipp'd, Rise into action and the earth redeem! And these, like moral incarnations prove Of all that sighing Ages had invoked, Or Truth predicted as the master-mould In which to cast our virtues. What was once An aimless yearning, or a blind desire Haunting the heart with perturbation wild, Is now personified by Form express And open: Want hath now a Priest obtain'd Whose genius gives each high abstraction voice, And bodies forth by energy sublime Sorrows which pleading Centuries long deplored. And such was Luther, when the clock of Time Sounded the hour for his decreed approach. He was the Mouthpiece of oppress'd mankind, A great Interpreter of tongueless wants And pains, which lack'd an intellectual Power Their own profundity to tell, or prove. Yet, Preludes dawn'd which oft a change foretold And Heralds of divine relief began More perfect morals and a purer creed To sanction, from the deeps of Scripture drawn, Ere the lone monk from out his convent pour'd Those thunder-peals of theologic truth, Which startled Leo from a sensual trance And shook the Vatican with such a force, Its chambers vibrate with th' impulsive blow, They gave them! though three hundred years Have swept their wings o'er Martin Luther's grave. There was a ripple in the mental tide Awaken'd; streams of holier thought began Heavenward and onward through the heart to roll, Till lo! at length, a master-Mind proceeds Forth from the secrecies of convent-life, In whom the Spirit of the age can find Its true Embodiment, by grace inspired The mind to utter and its motion wield. And we, who now the Reformation scan Mellow'd by time, and by experience tried, No random impulse, no erratic move Aimless and blind, in that achievement hail; But rather a momentum, pure and deep, From Deity Himself directly sent To Nature, that her inmost heart might wake. Reason and Man were agencies alone; They acted nought but instrumental parts: One Great Director did o'er all preside, But yet, invisible; behind the veil Of mortal drapery, His guiding hand Arrested, moved, and modified the work With sacred watch incessant. Hence the Cause So often grew mysterious, and appear'd Curtain'd by gloom infernal, which bemock'd A timid gazer; but the high result Proved far beyond what Romish annals feign,— Mere anarchy from man's revolted mind Heady and proud, by lawless will inspired. Nor was it but the negative excess Of haughty Reason, with disdainful ire All ritual forms time-hallow'd and revered, Trampling to dust: for then, the Work had died E'en in its birth, as imposition blind As baseless; founded in no faith, or law, And tinged with nothing but sectarian hues Petty, and partial. No, The Truth was there! And from that centre, like a scriptural heart, Recover'd Grace with throbs of doctrine sent A gospel life-blood through the generous Whole. And thus, th' Almighty did Himself inspire The Reformation: all unheard, unseen And unimagined, in the midst He moved, While Luther was the mental Hand, which made The outward Index of His secret will. And what makes history, but that Will evolved, In fact embodied, or in form contain'd! When thus perused, the page historic glows With life intelligent, and force divine: But when apart from heaven's presumed Decree The glooms or glories of this world we scan, Our creed must be confusion: then the Church Matter and mind alone can thus display To faith, or feeling. History's life is God: All second causes are the First disguised, And great results, though Man sole master seem, Produce mere echoes which His will repeat. And oh, how thrilling! touch'd with solemn awe, Or, pregnant with philosophy how deep, Are Time's events, when, thus divinely read! Here is the harmony of Things obtain'd, When from the Cross pure explanations flow, And one vast Principle itself reveals That binds with concord, and embraces all, Which else, looks chaos in the whirl of life. Yea, such the homage to some Power believed Empires and nation in His hand to hide, That pagan Instinct canonised the creed Ere God in gospel to the earth came down His heart revealing. Never yet hath man A wisdom high, or greatness holy sought, But claim'd he kindred with celestial Law And by Divinity himself explain'd. Thus Truth in time shall magnify the Cross, Until the hearts of God-revering men Echo on earth, the chant by angels sung In glory,—“King of Kings! and Lord of Lords! In Thee and for Thee, do all things consist In souls, or systems, by the world contain'd. BRITISH CHURCH. Vine of the Church! whose mystic branches are The Host elect of sanctified and seal'd Immortals, long as Christ is own'd supreme, Our light is safe, our liberty secure. But when to human from divine we turn With homage baseless, and to mortal Breath A blind Religion blinder incense pays, Our brightest health is but consumption's bloom. Faithful, or faithless to her Lord, as Head And true Bestower of all living grace, E'en thus, as our beleaguer'd Church hath stood, Sublime in gifts or sunken into shame The Bride of Jesus hath on earth display'd Her face, and features. To a threefold spring Religion must for sacramental life Betake her: and that triple source all time Illustrates,—Man, or God, or mortal Priest; As is each Master, so her fate hath been. But when the priest his sacerdotal chains, Forged from the links of apostolic truth Perverted, round about pale Conscience wove; When Man, unsceptred of his kingly mind, A mere automaton for ritual springs To pull or play, as guile or gain inspired Their priestly Mover; when to such The Esaus of the soul their birthright gave Of faith, and freedom in salvation's gift, Religion proved the Jailer of mankind, And bound their spirit in a rotting gloom Of pagan error. But when God appears Again refulgent on his Throne of grace, Revival wakens! and the Truth reform'd By monk or martyr, is but Christ unveil'd; Prophet, and Priest, and King of souls redeem'd The Church adores him. Then, Her powers expand, Her Symbols preach, her Sacraments revive; And in the glory of Her greatness seen As Ground and Pillar of the truth She stands. Angels admire, and friends cannot withdraw One ray of beauty from Her righteous crown! For thus, Ambassadress from heaven to earth, Glad tidings brings she on her mitred brow, And gives the full-toned Gospel: then erect In high pre-eminence o'er heart and head She holds the Saviour, crucified and crown'd. Sinner and sin to each her creed presents Befitting argument, for God and man. There, one is pardon'd—Mercy be adored! The other, punish'd,—Justice own the doom! Thus, in twin glory, Love and Law complete Their vast expression; hence alike, can Law The dreadful sanctions of its verdict teach, While Love o'er all celestial radiance pours, And pardoning Mercy in meridian shines. And art Thou not thus venerably graced, Founded in Christ, and by apostles form'd, Glory of England! oh, my mother-Church Hoary with time but all untouch'd in creed? Firm to thy Master, with as fond a grasp Of faith, as Luther in his free-born mind Clung to Emmanuel, doth thy soul remain. But yet, around thee scowls a fierce array Of foes and falsehoods, mustering each their powers, And all prepared, their hallelujahs wild Or wanton o'er thy fallen towers to lift Triumphantly. And well may thoughtful Hearts Heave with foreboding swell, and heavy fears, To mark how mad Opinion doth infect Thy children; how thine apostolic claims And love maternal are regarded now By creedless Vanity, or careless Vice. For time there was, when peerless Hooker wrote, And deep-soul'd Bacon taught the world to think, When Thou wert paramount, Thy cause sublime! And in thy life, all polity and powers The Throne securing, or in law enshrined, With all Estates our balanced realm contains, In Thee supreme, a master-virtue own'd And honour'd. Church and State could then co-work Like soul and body, in one breathing form Distinct, but undivided; each with rule Essential to the Kingdom's healthful frame; Yet both in unity august and good Together, under Christ their living Head, A hallow'd Commonwealth of powers possess'd. But now, in evil times, sectarian Will Would split The Body, and to sects reduce Our sainted Mother of th' imperial Isles, Which have for ages from Her bosom drank Those truths immortal life and conscience need. But never may th' indignities of Hearts Self-blinded, or the autocratic pride Of reason, by no hallowing faith subdued, One lock of glory from Her reverend head Succeed in tearing! Love and Awe and Truth Her doctrines preach with apostolic force; Her creed is Unity, her Head is Christ, Her Forms primeval as her Creed divine, And Catholic the crowning name she wears, MATERIALISM AND ITS CREED. And signs portend still more disastrous gloom, Frowning destruction over faith and forms That, once intact, by sanctity begirt, O'erawed betrayal. For a fitful heave, A restless panting for the Unattain'd And Undescribed, both church and world reveal. Knowledge alone, from Faith's protective law Divorced, would now sole educatrix be; While the dread Universe itself is tax'd For sensual income, through its living range. Down from yon palace, where the sun-King reigns, Throng'd by his court of seasons, to the dust Existence crumbles on her daily rounds,— All is for Profit! money makes the man, And man the money. Gold is England's God, While brute sensation forms the people's Lord; And men are mechanised to flesh-machines For grinding incomes out of earth and stones; Till glorious Nature, once by genius loved As one vast Temple where creation-rites Are acted, is a common work-shop now Polluted and depraved. Thus by sense deceived, Our Cains in creed, those deicides in mind, Abhor Religion with a quenchless hate, Scouting the future as the mock of fears, A poet's fiction, or a priest-born lie Venal, as groundless! Thus, can men conceive Income may do, what creeds have never done; Till conscience is at length by lust betray'd, And man,—a moral ruin! base and blind, Anarchic passion, and bereft despair. Myriads are such, whom sensual knowledge cheats, And depthless minds with most satanic guile Seduce, and govern. But, amid this whirl Of things, when all by ancient Worth admired And call'd immortal, waxes dim, and pale; When law is weak, and legislation blind; When guess-work dares all principle decry, And time-hoar'd Verities, by heaven approved As props and pillars of a nation's weal, Uprooted lie, by violation's grasp, And earth-born Self our second bible grows,— Lo! in the midst of this disastrous change The Church of England, like a bastion fronts The warring elements which round Her rise! Secure, unbroken, unalarm'd, and calm; And haply, if ordaining Heaven decree, The Spirit's organ for restoring life To Virtues dead, and Morals half extinct. SOURCE AND RELIEF OF UNREST. If language can articulate the Truth, What is the spring, the primal and profound, Of all commotion, strange, or deep, or strong? What is it, but the hunger of our hearts, A moral famine of the foodless mind For Good? or, thirst beyond all worlds to soothe, And all the cisterns of created joy To quench? But, in God's Infinite of truth, There may the intellect its rest attain! And in God's Infinite of love, the Will Responsive adequacy alone can find. Yet save in Christ, creation's true Relief, Where can unresting hearts repose enjoy? For here, all aspirations may their echo meet, Center in calm, and reach consummate bliss. But if that Christ in England's Church be found, In pulpit, sacrament and prayer enshrined (Her Priesthood faithful, and its Power express'd With order'd grace and discipline revered) Then, in the hands of her o'erwatching Lord, Yet may she bring to European hearts And spirit, that supply of nurt'ring truth They need, but cannot name. And signs exist Which stamp her, with significant effect, Teacher of nations, fated yet to draw The future round her, as a central ark, Where Light and Liberty and Law secrete Their saving essence, to conserve the world. For in her still, with all their force inspired Live the vast truths protesting Luther voiced Like battle-tones, before the ear of kings! And what, if thus by fav'ring heaven endow'd, The high deposit of the Faith she guard Unweaken'd? Trial then may glory prove, Safety and splendour may her conflicts crown; And what to our prophetic sense appears A Future charged with paralysing woe,— A true arena where our Church may stand Fighting the battles of primeval faith, May be, and grateful Empires call her blest! And lo! e'en now, prelusive shadows throng Round perill'd nations; signs which preach with power The sermons deep of providence to man. See Population, with enormous swell, Increase a thousand ere the sun decline, Day after day; while Space and Time depart Before the miracles by modern speed Enacted! Elements our vassals make; And, like a war-steed harness'd and controll'd, Ruled by proud Science, mark the subject Deep Commerce to all Her thousand ports convey, Rapid as winds can waft, or waters roll! Empires with empires thus new contact form, Powers with fresh powers, and minds with minds embrace, For vice, or virtue; all in fusion meet And mingle,—ready to ignite, and blaze Heavenward or hellward, as the truth prevails, Or falters: while around this huge ferment, See Legislation to the lowest brink Of sad Humanity her code direct; And Wisdom brood with speculation deep O'er plans and prospects, where the mind may grow And learn to build a moral Being up. These form the portents, which a change predict, Or solemn crisis; while the dormant East (That home of apathy and ancient pride) Wakes from Her torpor, with mysterious life And motion. What shall then the issue be, When the World labours with some big event Radiant with bliss, or dark with dreadful crime? To God we leave it! this may truth pronounce; That hell is forming where His grace breathes not; And let but once thy spark, Rebellion! fall Down on the mass of unconverted minds By treason moulded, or by anarchs led To lawless triumph,—and the World must bear Suff'rings untold, and horribly intense Beyond what Hist'ry hath for thought portray'd. Then Earth a pandemonium would present Raging with lust, or reeking with revenge, Till by her blood incarnadined, the World Would be as godless as the Fiend requires! ASPIRATIONS. Yet this, in mercy, may our God forbid! Nor leave the world a dungeon of despair, But bid the Church, by gracious heaven revived, Her apostolic rank in word and deed Resume, and dignify; and thus uplift Her mitred forehead, and Her saintly mien Untarnish'd, unattainted, safe alike From popish rancour, or schismatic rent. For in her shrine eternal morals dwell, And through her sacraments and creeds there flow Streams of pure life, from fontal Grace derived. But could the Mammons of our day succeed, Unchurch the Nation, prayer and praise destroy, Silence the Pulpit, and all means of grace Baffle, or blight, soon would Hell on earth A more than rival in debasement hail! For soul itself in sin would putrify, Or wither down to senselessness and shame; While Manhood, which the eye of faith declares A true shechinah for indwelling God, A mere contingency of breath and brain Becomes,—a paradox in flesh array'd, A baseless nothing, though baptised a man! But in thy heart, heroic England! long May Luther's voice, and Luther's spirit, live Unsilenced and unshamed. Thou peerless Home Of liberty and laws, of arts and arms, Of learning, love, and eloquence divine, Where Shakspeare dreamt, and sightless Milton soar'd, Where heroes bled, and martyrs for the truth Have died the burning death, without a groan,— Land of the beautiful, the brave, the free! Never, oh never! round thy yielded soul May damning popery its rust-worn chain Of darkness rivet; in the might of heaven Awake, and back to Rome's vile dungeon hurl Her shackles base of slavery abhorr'd! Without the Bible, Britain's life-blood chills And curdles; in that book, and by that book Almighty, freedom can alone be kept From age to age, in unison with heaven. Without it, life is but a ling'ring death, A false existence which begets decay, Or fevers only into restless life Whose blood is madness, and whose breath despair. For not Philosophy, with Attic grace Bedeck'd, and dazzling; nor can Science deep, Sounding with searchful eye the vast abyss Of things created; nor politic Weal Transcending all which earthly patriot dreams Of pure, and perfect, this vast empire guard: And though our banners on the four winds waft Defiance in the face of boundless foes, Our swords flash vict'ry, and proud Commerce vie With more than Tyre, upon her throne of waves Once free and famous, till our country prove The banking-center of all climes and creeds,— Reft of her Bible, not a drop remains Of holy life-blood in the Nation's heart! APOSTROPHÉ TO ENGLAND. Land of the Lord! my own maternal Isle! Still in the noontide of celestial love Basking, beneath the cross of Christ adored, How bounds the heart with patriotic throb Devoted, till each pulse a prayer becomes, When oft upon thy sea-dash'd cliff we stand, While ships by thousands haunt thy favour'd shores, And in their bosom half the world discharge Of riches and of splendour! God is thine, My country! faithful unto death be thou; For He has made and magnified thy strength, E'en like a second Palestine, to prove The Ark of Scripture, where a creedless world The truth may find which makes her spirit free! Thy bulwark is the Bible, in the heart Of Britain, like a second heart enshrined For inspiration, purity and power: And while upon thine ocean-throne erect, Scepter'd by prowess, Earth reveres thy reign, O'er public virtue as in private life May Scripture be sole paramount and test, The source and standard of majestic faith, Where morals form, and whence our motives flow. And thus, brave Empire! if thy Church beloved Firm to the truths a second Paul restored, Tenaciously through blood and fire remain, Then, long as guardian-waves begird Thy shores, or sunbeams o'er thy cornfields play, And thy large soul with liberty exults And brightens, will the Church uninjured stand, Saintly and solemn, by the wise revered, By greatness honour'd, as by goodness blest. And never may the touching sabbath-bells No echo in thy children's heart awake; When pealing softly with a pensive chime Or deep-toned cadence o'er thy hills and dales, Cities, and towns, and hamlets far away,— They bid us feel what Luther's victory won, Giving to myriads God's own Day of rest Pure as the dawn my page shall vision now. SABBATH MORN. And see! from out the radiant east, which blooms As if with blossoms of carnation'd light, The rose of Morning blushes into hues Of purpling splendour, till the arch of heaven Serenely mantled with one glow immense Of opal lustre, tells that Day is born, And that, a sabbath: sacred be the morn! To all who welcome with accorded rites Its high mementoes and its claims august. And oh, how numb'd by earth's torpedo-sway Their souls who will not, in the saintly prime Of this rapt morning, feel how God hath framed The world without intelligibly true By living concord to the world within. Now, matter seems a paraphrase on mind: We pour our spirit into sounds and scenes, Greeting creation, like an echo'd Self In forms repeated, for poetic eyes, Or hearts of high-strain'd purity, to hail. And now, from secret depths of faith within Rise thoughts, which in their trepid beauty hang Faintly and freshly on the virgin soul, By words unechoed. Sacramental hour, Hail to thy glories! from the Lord they come, And all they image but His name reflect: The very sunbeams their own sabbath keep, So hush'd and holy is the bright-hair'd Morn, While balm and beauty through creation's breast Are now prevailing! Nature's holy type To sabbath-keeping hearts it thus presents, Who early at the grave of Jesu watch Like Mary, to behold their rising Lord. We call it fancy, but it rules like fact O'er yielded spirits with seductive power,— Nature herself sabbatical becomes And greets that Day, which to the other six Imparts a pure and consecrating spell. But, mark the heavens! whose inspirations melt Through the deep eye which loves to drink their hues Like draughts of glory, till our flooded gaze O'erflows with radiance, and grows dim with light. The larks sing matins; while the humbler birds Send hallelujahs to the King of morn, Tiny and broken, but replete with praise; Who now, uprising from a throne of clouds, Bares his red forehead to the greeting World. The viewless finger of the fairy wind Wanders about, and with a dimpling touch Ripples a stream; or tunes the air to song, Till like an anthem by the breezes hymn'd Fancy admires it: but for this,—all earth Seems cover'd o'er with meditation's calm, Solemn as in some hoary minster dwells; And if the trees emotional were not By air-breaths flutter'd; or the lisping talk Of flowers, wind-ruffled; or the mellow tones Of gliding waters in their graceful flow Broke the blest calm,—'twere all a perfect trance In sweetest emblem of this hallow'd morn. But if from rustic solitude we look To where, through parted hills old Ocean heaves His breast of waters in the mantling sun, Thou hast no sabbath, ever-rolling Sea! Restless with glory: yet methinks, thy waves Throb like the pulses of a heart enrapt, When high emotions quiver into praise. THE TEMPLE OPENED. But, day advances: hark! from tower and spire Pointing the soul, like principles, to heaven And happiness, the many-voicèd bells Peal their high summons, which invite the world To meet her Maker, in His temple shrined Waiting due worship. Oh! ethereal Day Beyond the grossness of the belial-sense Rightly to value, what a blighted scene, Yea, what a prison-vault of petty cares, Polluted dreams, and soul-degrading joys Would earth, if sabbathless, at once become! For since like angels, men should feel and act By God approved, if glory such desire, How priceless is the sabbath! when we hail The soul of six days in the seventh divine. To let th' eternal o'er the temp'ral cast A shading awe, which bids this world away; Low earth to heaven by aspiration's wing To lift; by symbols and by signs to charm Cold nature, and imagination feed With rites which nourish for ennobling growth Our being; then, by combination due Of epochs high, traditions pure, and faith Unblemish'd, from a gospel-fountain drawn,— Here is the function which a Sabbath fills. With these conjoin appliances devout Of praise, confession, penitence, and prayer, Bathing the conscience in the crimson Blood Of Christ, and who can such a day blaspheme, Thus propertied with those divinest powers That to the secret roots of all which makes A people holy, or an empire wise, Send a live influence from Religion's heart? 'Tis chiefly through such institute sublime Sanction'd by God, and by Himself first kept, The soul's position in the truth appears E'en as it is before omniscient Heaven. Now are we taught by rites, and facts reveal'd, Or by appeals, whose virtue is Thy pang, Emmanuel! through a hidden grace applied, A truth which humbles, yet with holy might The heart attempers till it loves the law Celestial; e'en this truth, the base of all In moral code or creed religious found,— That God made man, but man himself unmade; And now is fallen from supernal heights Of being, into cursed and carnal depths Apostate, helpless, hopeless, and impure, And, having nothing but a guilt,—his own! Oh Verity! beyond our solving minds To master, but by all things sign'd and seal'd; Since nature providence and grace combine Their witness, and authenticate the Fall: Explaining much, itself is unexplain'd; Remains a myst'ry, but all myst'ries lights With radiance, pure as reason's eye approves. Deny it,—what a libel on the Love Almighty, does this blasted Earth become! So much of grandeur in our grief abides, So much of glory in our gloom appears, And in the soil of each corrupted soul So oft the foot-prints of departed God Leave shining impress of their primal track, That, if not fallen, but in form of mind Man in his perfect God-created mould Be yet apparent,—what a satire, then, On Power Creative seems our anarch state! Or rather, by such contradiction judged, Incarnate angels, base and yet sublime, Would men be christen'd, if no beam from heaven Lighten'd the gloom of this chaotic world. And therefore, glory to this Day benign! For now, eternity and time will meet, The heavenly on the earthly state shall dawn, And Man, who in the mass and multitude Of work-day powers, and worldly movements, makes Too often but an item unobserved, Here in the Temple, where a church becomes A shrine of morals to regen'rate hearts, Himself shall realise as full-orb'd Man! Single and one, within him hiding depths Of solemn, vast, and individual life Beyond all utt'rance! life which few discern Or ponder, yet beyond all speech august, Since there alone our secresy of strength And power of unpartaken being dwell. For what is Action, but the spirit's garb, The form and pressure of a Life unseen? And that, more awful than the outer-sense Can shape, or recognise by teaching words. But life exterior, with its painted shows, And all its multiplex array of scenes By conduct acted or experience tried, Is like the ripple marked on ocean's face,— Hiding an unregarded deep below And tempting gazers to discern no more. Then, lift your heads, ye Everlasting Doors! And be ye open, O Eternal Gates! That in the chariot of descending grace Borne by His Spirit down to hearts which pray, The King of Glory with His train of truths Begirt, may come, and find due welcome there. England! be grateful; for a scene that fills The soul with thoughts, whose dialect is tears, Around us opens with expansive range. Uncounted steeples now to heaven uplift Their chimes, and swell the wafting air with tones Which rise and fall, like undulating waves In volumed cadence heaved upon the shore: And touching are they!—for the tombs of Time Open amid them, as they peal, or pause; While buried hopes, and forms, and feelings dead Quicken beneath their resurrection-tones Mysterious. But far more than gazing sense On earth can witness, will those gather'd souls Who meet for worship with commingled awe, The God Incarnate,—to the Angels bright This morn discover, when the piercing truth Enters their spirit with irradiant power, And bares the bosom of the soul to light! For hearts to them, are like transparent hives, Whose hidden workings are conspicuous made And watch'd for ever. Yes, the sabbath gives Wisdom to Angels, while they bend to see How nature struggles, as the Spirit acts, Revives our graces, or a sin rebukes; Or, drags the guilty to that secret bar, That stern tribunal where dread conscience reigns, And self by self is summon'd!—'Tis a day When such bright Angels watch the soul redeem'd Who love to think, where infidels would sneer, And learn divinity by reading man. DAY OF THE LORD. But, though some emanated charms exist Born of the sabbath, which no eye discerns Profoundly as consummate Angels can, Haunting our temples with their wings unheard And eyes unwitness'd,—yet, enough remains To prove a magic clothes this holy morn Beyond all others, beautiful and deep. And now, methinks that potency begins, Open the heavens, and drop their sacred dews Distilling balm, and blessedness, and love. Whether to yon cathedral, with its form August, and massive elegance of towers Serenely rising in the radiant air, Your fancy wander, and awhile enjoy The wave-like rollings of the organ peals Bursting, and booming down the archèd aisles And hollow naves, while choir, and chanted rites, And vested priesthood in their pure array, With awful loveliness the scene inspire: Or rather, if to some arcadian haunt Where rustic manners in ancestral stamp Are yet embalm'd, you turn the roving eye To view the patriarchs of some village-plain Throng to their minster, with its gothic porch And ivied windows, 'mid encircling yews Embosom'd dimly,—yet, in each alike How much of all the Reformation won For peace and purity, devotion finds! E'en where yon palaces of Commerce lift Their dusky, dim, and many-window'd piles, 'Mid roar of capitals, or cities vast, How does the day, on which Messiah rose, Check the loud wheels, and hush the grating jars And vexing hum of avarice and gain, That care-worn artizans, with pallid cheeks, And all the wasted family of Toil, Each with his little one, awhile may feel That Men are more than rational machines For shaping matter, or absorbing food! And on this day, by Heaven's ordaining law Rank'd in the rubric of perpetual Grace, Their sacred brotherhood in God enjoy. There, as they group beneath the Bible's wing, And through the centralising love of Christ The level glory of our nature reach Together, who can tell what sweet content, What calm submission to their clouded lot, And wasting sorrows which their toil-worn lives Experience ever,—from such moment flows! Here all are equal by the bond of flesh, The ties of nature, and in guilt, with God: Here, crowns, and coronets, and sceptres drop To nothing; king and subject share alike: And in thy royalties, redeeming Love! A prince may falter, where a peasant lifts His plea; while in the poor man's eye may shine A tear of rapture, kingdoms could not raise, Nor all which earth's diameter contains Purchase the peace a sainted conscience hath. Glory! to think that on this morn mankind Bow at the footstool of their Common Sire In co-equality of dust, and sin, To plead for mercy at Salvation's fount. Ye mighty Hunters in the fields of truth, Titans of thought! ye giants of renown! Colossal wonders in the world of mind, Who with the shadow of a soul immense Cover creation! though your genius charm Th' eternal Public of posterity, Your names are nothing in the balance, now! Bend the stiff mind, and bow that stubborn heart, And in the pleadings of your helpless guilt Go, take your station with yon cottage-girl, Or, chant a verse with yonder hymning child, And happy are ye! if like them, ye feel True wisdom is our ignorance to know. There, cast your anchors in the cloven Rock Of Ages! for, behind the Veil it towers Deep as eternity, and high as God. Abhorr'd be therefore a satanic wish,— That e'er by riot, lust, or lawless gain, Or by some logic false as fiends inspire, Our sabbaths in due sanctity should fail Or falter. On two worlds, at once, they touch, The Lights of this, the Landmarks of the next; And reft of such, all anarchies commence To madden: nor can praise itself o'erprize The order'd notions of a sabbath-day, When thou, maternal Church! whose head is hoar'd With ages, but whose heart, like Jesu's, beats With love for spirits,—art a blessing proved By forms, by functions, and by ritual chants, And sacraments of soul-exalting grace. Thine is a work, beyond seraphic lyres To celebrate; for now, by Thee allured, The infant, with its lisping tongue may speak More truths than prescient Socrates could tell, Or Plato in his most unearthly dream Embody. Yes, the Church is Reason's friend! For, what is Reason but th' informing Word By grace imparted? and as He begins Our nature's law to regulate and rule, So all the circles of our secret life Concentrical with perfect reason act. And though alike the humble and the high In sermons, sacraments, and symbols meet Depths of divinity they cannot wade, And meanings never master'd, yet by such Our mental energies are boldly train'd With truths to wrestle, as the patriarch did With God's own Angel, nor to let them go Without a blessing. But the creed which aims Both man and faith in horizontal lines To level, proves a flatt'ring lie, that draws A force from reason, which it feigns to give; Like fawning ivy round some oak entwined Eating the heart its verdure seems to brace. Again then, be our lauding chants uplift To Him most holy, to the sabbath's God! Who when the Planets sang their lays of light While young Earth from her liquid cradle rose Rejoicing, from His Throne of love decreed A sabbath endless, modell'd from his Own,— A rest whose archetype Himself enjoy'd. Long may our Church, with her organic powers And rites ministrant, this pure Day revere: For sabbaths make the morals of our land; And by their litanies of sacred love, By pulpit, priest, and all that past'ral sway Which makes the meanest village in our land Some moral hues of soft refinement take, They form thermometers, whereby to mete Our true advancement in the noblest weal: Since, public virtue, monarchy, and law, And Church with State together are espoused By league of principle, and power of love. Hence, if our sabbaths be from sway dethroned The music of the Commonwealth is gone! Soon into atoms will dissolve and drop That Fabric eloquent, whose walls are mind, And founded deep in immemorial laws And liberties,—the Constitution falls! Then guard them well, ye Senators and Priests, For they are priceless; and to us preserve All which in heart and home, in Temple, or in State Is pure of worship, or of lore profound. And he who robs them of their rightful sway By pen, or speech, example, creed, or life, On Heaven itself a sacrilege presumes; Man's awful being to the center shocks And plucks the apple from a Nation's eye! EVENTIDE. Now ere we part, let meditation look Once more on nature. Lo! the day is done; And like the radiance of a lovely dream Poetic slumber visions, softly melts, And sweetly mellows into parting hues The hour of sunset. From the ruby west A flashing glory o'er the firmament Deepens along, and over earth reflects Beauty, which touches flower, and field, and fruit, And yellow corn-fields sloping o'er the vale, With charms more exquisite than garish noon Inspires. And if on yonder height we stand, Beneath us what a British Arcady In lustre qualified with coming shade Is then unveil'd, by sunny calm serened! There as we pause, around our temples throng The fresh-wing'd airs, from waving branches sent; The breeze makes music; while the cadence low Of distant sheep-bell dyingly comes on, Or sinks delightfully on Feeling's ear. Here Nature thrones enchantment: far-off hills Crown'd with a coronet of glitt'ring trees, Paler and paler, to the west retire 'Mid wood and coppice, lane, and hedges green, With sun-bright cots, and farms of mossy roof; While here and there some rustic temple shews That gothic beauty, whose mysterious power Acts on the eye like poetry in stone Embodied. These in blent expression woo The gazer; mix'd with many a fairy gleam From rivers flashing, as the sun-ray tips Their current, cheering it with gay surprise. But now, a mellow shade of mantling hue Advances; villages and towns retire Like pictured visions, save where yonder tower In its tall symmetry with golden tinge Retains the sunbeam; and as home you wend, Hark! on the ear of balmy Evening comes The faint far chime of some cathedral-bell, Whose pensive cadence to the fancy sounds A curfew for Creation's sabbath rest. That hallow'd rest is deep'ning: daylight ebbs; But yet, or ever sinks yon Priest of light, Around Him like a burning shrine the heavens Gather and glow, and with their beams infold His dying pomp; while colours rich, and deep, And dazzling, woven from th' Almighty's loom Of nature, all the occident inlay. Brighter and brighter His dilated orb Is now becoming; till, at length, He sinks In soft decline magnificently calm Beneath th' horizon, leaving all above Tinged with his radiance; as true saints derive From God's own heroes, when their dying beds In farewell glory give the christian out,— Flashes of meaning which the face o'erspread With lustre, and the gazer's cheek impress With light, whose source is immortality. Vistas of thought, and avenues of mind Where Truth may roam in philosophic shade, Or Fancy by her shaping dreams begirt, Image beyond what pict'ring words describe, Open before us; while this pensive lull And balmy prelude to the twilight's reign Come o'er the heart, till with sabbatic love Nature and mind responsively confer. Oh, how the sacredness of silence steals O'er all things! just as if a spirit-glide, Inaudible but felt, through earth and air Were passing. Mute and motionless, the trees Stand in the gloom like sentinels entranced; Not e'en an insect through the stirless air At times is waking: boughs and birds repose; While the dark shadows of yon distant hills Arrest the eye, portentous and profound, As if with speaking vastness: but the flowers Breathe double fragrance, now the heated air Is cooling; and a thousand secret plants Which in the sun-warm noon their scents retain Inviolate, a rich aroma yield; Like hearts whose finer sympathies are shut When fortune brightens, but when sorrow's night Blackens around you, let their sweetness forth: Or, as those promises the Spirit's love To faith applies, which seldom while the sun Of joy shines golden, make their treasures known, But in our glooms, how gloriously they breathe Their buried meanings into living force And comfort!—But more hush'd and holy still, Grows the dim landscape round the muser's tread Who walks it, till he dreams his very step Profane intrusion on the soundless air. And now methinks, Miltonic eyes would view Angelic Watchers of our mystic world Patrolling earth, with immaterial garb And tread unseen; or by their Lord employ'd The wheels of nature to redress; or guide The comings-on of Night, who soon begins To spread Her mantle o'er the sleeping world. Now rules the hour, when dormant Conscience wakes If rack'd, or guilty; when Religion looks On truths unwitness'd on the garish day, While awed Imagination lives, and feels Th' unborn poetry of speechless mind Within her quicken'd: loud the heart-throbs beat; And in this syncopé of nature's voice What mute theology a moment wields O'er the strain'd fancy! now indeed, we prove That worded speech to manhood appertains, But silence the Almighty's language is; And faith can hear it, by Himself entoned With inspirations from eternity. MOONLIT SCENE. But that is o'er; and from the shrouding awe That girds thee, with a gentle force awake. E'en such a night, as now prepares to reign, The captive Luther from his watch-tower loved To witness, when by inward prayer becalm'd, He roll'd his eye-glance round the vaulted heavens Studded with stars, like Scripture gemm'd with truths; And gave his spirit to the charm of night With all a poet's rapture! Such begins O'er the lull'd twilight to assert its reign Of trancèd loveliness, and stellar noon. Lo! one by one, with timid gleam, and slow, Star after star comes trembling into life And lustre; radiant, mild, and mournful oft Like the half-tears in Childhood's pensive eye, Faintly they shine; while planets, rich and round, Like burning jewels dug from mines of light Flash on the forehead of the mellow'd sky Most brilliantly; or, cluster'd into groups, The rest commingle their associate beams Dazzling the concave. Still, the earth obscured Lies dimly veil'd, with umbrage unrelieved, Waiting the lamp which lights her beauties up. And, yonder comes it! lo, her placid brow O'er the dusk air yon queenly Moon uplifts; And e'en as music, solemn, deep and slow, Through the dark chambers of dejected mind Where all is shapeless, oft to order cites Thought after thought, successive and serene, So her wan lustre, as it mildly steals O'er the mute landscape, tree, and bough, and bank, Each out of dimness and disorder draws To shape and aspect; till the dew-drops gleam Like Nature's diamonds on her night-garb thrown, In countless sparkles: all the stars grow pale, Like mortal graces near th' excessive blaze Of Thine, Emmanuel! save th' undazzled brows Of those large planets, eloquent with beams Unrivall'd. What a witching spell the moon O'er all things by her fairy radiance flings! Like faith, arising in some nighted heart And touching nature with redemption's light Celestial. Wheresoe'er his roving eye Darts a pleased glance, lo! hill, and brook and hedge, Rivers and streams, and meadowy range far-off, Cities and towers, and tall cathedral-spires, And village-churchyards with their grassy tombs Attract the gazer; till his glance is charm'd With loveliness, beyond the moving lip To mention. But above, how beautiful! There, solemnly the climbing moon ascends, And each thin cloud within her silver reach She clothes with splendour; like a mortal pang By hope regen'rate into radiant peace Transmuted. But in this access divine Of Nature's sabbath, solitude and night, How like the fortunes of the Saviour's Bride The Moon's high progress through the heaven appears! Varied, and full, now crescent and complete, Shaded, or dim, and then with radiance clad, So hath the Church along time's clouded scene Flourish'd, or faded, shined, or suffer'd gloom, But yet doth travel through her fated round Upward to glory! Or, may deeper eyes discern In yon pale symbol of mysterious sky, The moon-like radiance of imperfect man By grace made holy, but how changeful too! E'en to the last by shades of sin o'erhung And hidden: while th' imperial Lord of day, By His prerogative of light portrays That sun-clear righteousness of state complete, Which all the justified of God arrays With faultless glory, fair as Jesus wore. NATURE AND THE CROSS. But that deep Name, beyond all nature loud, Peals like the trumpet of Eternity Through secret chambers of responsive faith, Making them echo with the voice of Christ! Nature was forfeit, when the first man fell By sin; and whatsoe'er in nature lives, In reason, morals, or in mind enacts Dominion, from His vast atonement flows. Creation once her own Creator saw In Flesh embodied, when for sin He died! And now from Him this hour of beauty takes All that cloud, or star-encircled moon Is lovely. Here indeed, material sights Touch'd by the Cross, with sacred meaning glow, Turning creation to a creed of forms Significant and glorious. What a truth! Through Him this orb of sentient being came From nothing cited; by His ceaseless hand The wheels of nature, and the wings of time Circle their way, or waft their soundless flight; While all those properties those creatures have Are but the actings of atoning Love By virtue present. Here is faith heaven-born! When all the motions which in Nature rule, Her laws, and lights, her harmonies and hues, From the faint insect to the flaming sun Apparent, preach the Saviour's kingly hand, And to the senses mirror forth His heart For ever. What the sinful Adam lost, The Sinless by eternal heirship gain'd; The curse unsting'd, then took th' attainder off And back redeem'd th' inheritance of Man. Oh, tell me not, poetic harps can sing, That science loves, and sentiment perceives, And calm philosophy, with musing eye Beneath the stars enraptured,—all which heaven And earth of God and goodness testify; 'Tis only when by David's key unlock'd, The Secrets and the Splendours of the world Unfold their magic, and by grace reveal'd, Electrify the soul of answ'ring love. The merest elegance which Pagan mind Imparted, upward to creative Power And goodness, dimly groped its erring way: But when the Christian His incarnate God Owns to be Head of all creation is, All life becomes one vast religion; And faith and feeling in communion move Divorceless ever. Then, at once, all laws And movements, like cathedral-rites appear By nature's liturgy of Love perform'd In the vast temple of the universe, Shrining Emmanuel: then, the Whole applies To Him the watching, weeping, dying, Lord, The source of nature and salvation too, The priceless merit of Whose Blood preserves The heavens in motion and our earth alive. So may we learn, at this nocturnal hour, Morning, or noon, whatever time we walk The halls of Nature with a holy tread, All bright and beautiful, all vast and fair, In Him to love, Who, when creation sinn'd And crime on earth began like hell to reign, Personified eternity in time, And clothed th' Infinite with human Flesh For our remission! HUSH OF NIGHT. But the night is come; The Moon, with her pale hierarchy girt Of stars, is gliding to the ocean's brim, And listen! for the chime of far-off bells O'er a dead Sabbath tolls their dying tone: And now, the Day is buried; to thy tomb Eternity! with all its hopes and fears, Gather'd and gone. But oh, how thrill'd The chords mysterious of our secret frame! As if the stirrings of a life unborn, Latent but lovely, this rapt hour inspired, The Dead seem gazing on our hearts again! Illapses deep, irradiations pure Glide through our spirit from a source unknown; Until, by awful loveliness subdued, Above, the pilgrim lifts his eye of prayer Expressive: youth, and home, and long-fled days With soft revival touch him into tears Unshed; and while yon arch of midnight rings With the soft echoes of those sunken chimes Around him, many a thoughtful sigh is heaved O'er visions gone; and things that once becharm'd His dazzled fancy, pale and cold appear,— Weeds of the past on Mem'ry's lonely shore! And now, amid thy hush, most holy Night! Here let us stand beneath yon hanging cliff, Closing our song beside the placid sea Which now lies breezeless. Who that thus beholds Her bosom, by the braiding moonlight deck'd, And heaving only to attraction's orb, As pant young hearts beneath the eye they love, Could ere imagine, everlasting Sea! Thy billows, like the roar of human wrongs, Clamour on high and cleave the heavens with sound So often! Such thy halcyon slumber now, The stars are mirror'd on thy glassy wave, With beam unbroken; while the feet which press The pebbled margin of yon moonlit-wave, Rudely and loudly on the hush intrude Their faintest motion. Here, then, be farewell To this blent strain of meditative truth, E'en by thy bulwark, O Britannic Isle! Whom Ocean ramparts with her wall of waves. Now in the trance of this untroubled night While all seems holy, our adoring hearts To that supernal Power of truth we lift, Who guardeth Empires, and Who guideth thee, My country! with a most peculiar love: That once as out of Zion peal'd the trump Of ancient Gospel, hence the battle-voice Of Truth should never cease to challenge Rome; But waken echoes, bold as Luther's cheer Might welcome, deep as lofty Cranmer loved, Or Ridley o'er his pangs of fire prolong'd. FINAL APOSTROPHÉ. Mysterious Spirit of the ceaseless mind! Heart of the Church, as Christ the only Head; Soul of our souls! in supernat'ral light Unbounded, deathless and transforming Grace, And Love, and Wisdom, Thee I now invoke; And to Thyself presume to consecrate Pages, that whatsoe'er of hallow'd power They have, from Thee alone their truth receive And virtue. Oh! thou Sempiternal Life, Breathe o'er this effort, and with force array Whate'er is feeble; and by heavenly touch And tone their meaning so affect and fill, That onward to the inner-mind of man, Or central being, where high Conscience holds Her seat august, and faith's dominion acts, What truths they carry may be safely borne Beyond the heartless, and above the vain To warp or weaken. Here, beneath the arch Of midnight, solemn, deep, intensely calm, Thy Presence would I realise, and lift Mine awe-struck nature to the heights unseen Of Essence Uncreate, where Thou art Third In Godhead, as the Fountain-Sire is first, Second, the Filial Word, and All supreme As One co-equal, co-eternal Three. Descend pure Spirit! light and life and love Without Thee, are not: poetry is Thine; Reason and science, and majestic arts, The heaven-born virtues, intellectual powers, And all pre-eminence in grace or gift Are but as glances from Thy glory cast, And caught by mind. But, who Thy sway can tell? For at the first, the Heavens and all their host, Moon, star, and planets, from Thy hand derived Their radiance, from Thy wisdom learn'd their paths. And Earth is thine: Her elemental laws, Her motions, harmonies, and living hues Are but the efflux of Thy fontal powers; While Man himself, that miracle of forms! Into his mould was copied from Thy cast Ethereal; and the whole of truths inspired, Prophetic utterance, or miraculous deed, Which was, or is, or shall be, are but rays Sent from Thine Essence to created mind. Without Thee, more than night Egyptian reigns; Duty sublime would stern distraction be, Commanding what our impotence alarms,— To love the Holy, which our hearts abhor By nature! But Thy promised aid attends, Arches our being like the roof of heaven Where'er we wander, and to Will perverse Such power imparteth, that the precept takes Thy presence with it, in each task assign'd. Thou teachest God; and man himself abides By thought unfathom'd, till Thy light reveal The two eternities of coming truth Within him folded, like a double germ Soon to expand, in heaven or hell complete. And hence, our Nature grows an awful thing: We thrill eternity in touching Man; Since from the deeps of his immortal soul Outlooks The everlasting, whence he came! Unerring Judge! to Whose omniscient gaze All the seal'd fountains of shut motive lie Unseal'd and open, richly deign to bless Both church and state, our monarchy and crown; Teaching the highest, that of Thee bereft Reason itself irrational becomes, And virtues vices, with a better name And brighter seeming: while by Thee becalm'd, The rudest chaos of corrupted hearts At once is soften'd, till in love and awe Embodied harmony the Man appears, Lives in Thy life, and thus by grace becomes A radiant Likeness of the Lord he loves. And now, O Spirit! at the noon of night, Under the shade of these expressive skies, While all around the hush of heaven prevails, Thee I invoke, a christian song to bless; From Whom apart, 'tis vanity and voice, Or mere vexation into language thrown: But when Thy sanction hath the poet crown'd, His harp-strings quiver with a breath divine And all its tones with heaven-born music ring. They in my soul of aspirations dwell For truths beyond Philosophy to preach, Or master; if one thought this perill'd mind Inspire, where Thou, O God of grace, art seen, Prevenient Spirit! 'tis from Thee derived. And oh, if Life, with all its loneliness, The glow of youth hath still in heart retain'd; If the stern waste, the fever, and the fret Of buried pangs beyond the world to know, From boyhood in its bleakness, e'en till now, Have not untuned me, but a tone have left In concord with the beautiful and bright; If nature thrill me, with as keen a joy As in the poetry of pensive youth It ever did; if such for bliss remain, Blent with far deeper things, by suff'ring taught And faith transmuted for the life within, As onward through a bleak and heartless world My pathway windeth to the waiting tomb, Spirit of Glory! take my gratitude And sanctify the closing strain I sing. Bear with my soul; Thy blessing o'er it breathe And all who love the Master whom I serve. Emmanuel! peace within thy Church abide; Till faith shall in sublime fruition end, All symbols cease, all sacraments retire, Our earthly sabbaths into heavenly rise For men and angels, and the host redeem'd In the one Temple of pure Godhead keep The sabbath endless of almighty love.

Earth, air, and ocean, glorious three! Inspired with living poesy, More gladly than a bird regains The freedom of unbounded plains, And wanders on ecstatic wing O'er meadow, lake, or laughing spring, My spirit from the world retreats; Again the bright Creation greets, And learns how Nature's smile can bless The hearts which love her loneliness. How eloquent this silent hour! Surrender'd to its lulling power, The soul forgets that tears are shed, That hopes are dim, and pleasures dead: A hue of heaven on earth descends; Th' immortal with the mortal blends; And all we fancy, frame, or see, Is found in faultless harmony. Oh! ever thus, while bards can feel, And celebrate with hymning zeal The glories which for good combine, The universe becomes divine: Behind the veil of sense they dwell Encinctured with a dazzling spell; Where'er they tread, enchantment lives, And Beauty all her magic gives To hallow with poetic grace Whatever dreaming eye would trace. To them, the finished world is fraught With fine appeals to glowing thought; And meanings flow from all they view, Of vast in form, or fair in hue; And not a ray of sunshine gleams But there the smile of Godhead seems In token of paternal love Reflected from His face above! His torpid mind I envy not Though crown and kingdom were his lot, Who here, amid this morning balm And conscious Nature's dream-like calm, With tender sky and tranquil sea Partook no inborn sympathy. The canopy of heaven is hung As blue as poet ever sung; Though here and there serenely glide Along the air's cerulean tide Pale clouds, which seem too delicate For breeze to touch their fairy state. Beneath a window, far away O Stranger, let thy fancy stray, For seldom can thy dreams expand Their wings o'er more delightful land: The warble of yon distant waves, As lightly oft the billow laves The greenwood-bank and grassy shore That bounds the sea of Elsinore; The mountain's dim and dusky form, Which, like a dying thunder-storm, Glooms on the air with awful swell; The chiming of the castle-bell, From frowning turret faintly heard; The fruited boughs by breezes stirred, With every sound that summer brings From bird, and bee, and happy things, How exquisitely all combine To make exulting morn divine! And look, adown yon dimpled sea As bright as liquid sun could be, The tiny skiffs of Norway sail And glitter, cloud-like, in the gale; While frequent oars with flashing stroke Appear, as oft the tide is broke By fleet-wing'd bark, which gaily flies To where the sand-girt Sweden lies. In green extent of wood and hill, With bowery hamlets, bright and still. To him who loves a haunted scene Where grief or glory once hath been, Grey Cronburgh lifts her storied pile And darkens o'er the Danish Isle: Whose vaulty depths and caves profound Have echoed to the wizard sound Of clanging shield, and shaken lance, With each grim voice of old Romance. And there on Fancy's spell-bound eyes Behold! that royal spectre rise, By Shakspeare summon'd, when the bell Of midnight groan'd the hour's farewell. But, ere thou leave the castled height, Survey o'er all a patriot sight, A scene that makes the life-blood start And pictures England on his heart, The banners Nelson thrill'd to see Behold them wave!—how gallantly They flout the wind with haughty threat, And show the Deep her victor yet! When bravely down yon beauteous tide The monarchs of the ocean ride; Or, tranced amid the drowsing air, They whiten in the noontide glare Those wings that wait the driving breeze To waft them o'er a hundred seas! Reflected on the wave is cast The symmetry of sail and mast; Or, booming o'er the startled deep, Loud echoes of their cannon sweep, Whose thunders in their dauntless tone Can mock the Tempest on his throne! Yet not on earth exists a scene Where shades of sorrow have not been: The softest verdure mead can spread Is often paced by Misery's tread; The magic of the clearest sky Hath mock'd how many a clouded eye! And, link'd with all that local grace The wizard Fancy loves to trace Wherever Nature weaves a spell Round wood, or crag, or hoary dell,— Live recollections sad as deep, To bid Imagination weep. And thus in this elysian hour Oh! who can gaze on Cronburgh tower, Nor dream of her, the young and gay, Whose captive spirit pined away The victim of a royal hate, In the vile gloom of dungeon-state! Dejected queen! I view thee now With pleading eye, and pensive brow As pale as moonlight and as mild; Or, watching o'er thy cradled child While visions of regretted youth Around thee float in fairy truth, Till the full past o'ercrowds thy brain, And thou art in thy home again! But when at night a thund'ring sound Of wave on wave, in deep rebound Rang echoed o'er the castle-wall, How wildly did that night appal! How many a terror shook thy form, As Midnight roused the yelling storm, And, like the rush of demons, past The pinions of the northern blast, And through a grated window broke The flashes of each lightning-stroke!— Yet oft arose a sunny mood, When gladness e'en an exile wooed, As, gazing from a rampart's height, Her eye might gather free delight, While slowly pealed the turret-bell, And richly over Zealand fell The flushes of retiring day, Till earth one mass of glory lay! Beneath her roam'd the Baltic wave, Where oft an English banner gave (While roll'd the gun's saluting roar,) A dream of that remember'd shore Her heart was doom'd to hail no more! There, oft as gradual eve decayed And glimmer'd o'er the beechen-shade, How Denmark's bloom her smile would bless, Laid forth in Eden loveliness, Of bank and meadow, bush and stream Like landscape in a painter's dream! Or where the rocky Sweden lowers She mark'd Landscrona's faded towers; Or musing saw in verdant rest The garden once by Hamlet prest, When haunted by majestic grief The princely mourner scorn'd relief, And dared to nurse in dreaming pain The might and madness of his brain. With many a gleam of pensive joy Her captive-gloom could not destroy, O'er sad Matilda ling'ring past The lonely years, by fate o'ercast With shadows of imputed crime, Which deadened hope, and darkened time, Till when, at Britain's high behest, The exile found a foreign rest: Entranced upon the deck she stood And, while her straining vision could, (As o'er the billows' bounding play Her wafted vessel flew away)— On Cronburgh's battlemented pile Array'd by evening's rosy smile, Matilda fixed her yearning eyes While heaved her breast with broken sighs, And on her cheek sat meek despair, That mourn'd a child deserted there!— There, in that tower where time had been A sad, but still maternal scene; How thrilling was that farewell-hour Sublim'd by Pity's godlike power! The mariner subdued his tone, To make a mother's grief his own; And souls who mock'd the lightning-flash, Or dared the billows' wildest dash, Felt more than milder bosoms fear And soften'd down to woman's tear! But, hark! the wind hath changed its tone; The sun hath veil'd his burning throne; And o'er the dazzling blue of heaven Prophetic shades of storm are driven; And fiercely shoots the slanting rain On garden-bower, and window-pane, While leaflets fall from branch and tree, Like hopes from human vanity; And like the moan of billows heard From yon dim ocean, tempest-stirr'd, With sounds that tell a dreary track The waves of Life come rolling back, That awful Life! whose endless roar Breaks loud upon th' Eternal shore! As one, when torture long hath tried And rack'd his eye-lids, sleep-denied, While bound in slumber's silken chain And calm in heart and cool in brain, Awakens on his midnight bed To ghastly sense or gloomy dread, And feels again each pang begin To wrench the writhing soul within; So wakes a heart that dreams awhile All earth in sabbath-peace to smile Around him like this lovely isle, Till darkness on his dream descends And in the world his vision ends. A moment is a mighty Thing Beyond the soul's imagining; For in it, though we trace it not, How much there crowds of varied lot! How much of life, life cannot see, Darts onward to eternity! While vacant hours of beauty roll Their magic o'er some yielded soul, Ah! little can the happy guess The sum of human wretchedness; Or dream amid the soft farewell That Time of them is taking, How frequent moans the funeral knell, What noble hearts are breaking, While myriads to their tombs descend Without a mourner, creed, or friend! Could Fancy reach some throne of air What vision would await Her there! In tumult, agony, and strife, Rolls the loud sea of human Life! Before a despot's gilded throne Hear Kingdoms weep, and Nations groan; Yet tyrants in their slumber start To feel the dagger at their heart; And they can hear the murder'd call, Can trace the hand upon the wall, And not a slave who lays him down Would change a dungeon for their crown! Lo! yonder gleams a hoof-torn plain Where moon-light shrouds th' unburied slain, And bare against the naked sky A thousand helmless foreheads lie! On one is seen a parting trace By torture graven on the face, As dying Valour swoon'd away, And blood congeal'd to breathless clay; While others on their cheeks express A smile from woman's tenderness,— A ray of that remember'd scene Where the bright heaven of home had been! But, hark! from ocean heaves a cry Deeper than when the tempests die, As down men kneel upon the deck, And listen to the crashing wreck! A minute—and the murd'rous Storm Hath mangled that colossal form, Which floated o'er terrific seas, Defied the blast, and faced the breeze, But now, a fragment!—and the wave Lies howling o'er the seaman's grave. From these avert thy fear-struck view; A vision, not so dark in hue, But awful, with its deep array Of all we suffer, do, or say, The throne of Fancy may command, While picturing with creative hand The domes and temples, street and bath, Whate'er a haughty City hath Of sin and freedom, to decoy The hearts whose pulse is tuned to joy. And what a world of secret care Lies wall'd within that compass there! Where, Thought and Deed for ever toil, And life is one permitted spoil As each from cradle to the grave Is half a tyrant, half a slave; And shuts his breast, and steels the heart, While Vice and Virtue act their part And rarely lets the spirit speak, But plays the courtier with his cheek; Whose ready smile, like moon-light, when It flutters o'er some noisome den, Can bid the soul's corruption shine And make its meanness look divine! Yes! there in yonder city now O'er which young Morning bends her brow, On tower and temple smiling bright, How weeping angels watch'd the night! A captive tore his chain-worn limb, And deem'd that God deserted him; A felon heard the life-blood stream, And saw the gallows in his dream; The maniac's eye renew'd its glare While his lip writhed with mocking pray'r: The miser mutter'd in his sleep And counted o'er and o'er his heap, Then seem'd with restless hand to hold And taste the touches of his gold! And while in rooms of Revelry Pleasure beheld bright moments flee, A pillow for some dying head With aching hand and heart was spread; And who but sleepless Heaven can say When Earth confronts the Judgment-Day, The darkness of a thousand deeds Dread Midnight in her shadow breeds! For ever in the world there lies What meets alone immortal Eyes; While all man dreads that man should see He dares unveil to Deity, As though where guilty feet have trod No power should track them, but his God! And, pale Ambition! Sad wert thou, As wanly on thy wasted brow The feeble watch-light flung its ray, While ebb'd thy pulse with dying play:— But when thy filmy eyes uprose Their glance untomb'd thy buried woes, And round the room a meaning cast Which told of time and truth o'ercast, While fever'd blood and martyr'd frame Avenged the toils that won a name! And is it thus dark Life appears A fountain of unfailing tears, While to each minute's flight is given The gloom of hell, or glance of heaven? Lo! Nature speaks to all who look And read aright Her glorious book, How much there dawns to mitigate The bleakness of our barren state. Oh! who can hail the breeze-wing'd morn When beauty in the heavens is born, Or wander forth in sun or storm, Nor love Creation's living form! And life, though oft a wilderness By passion made and wild distress, Where like a leaf by autumn blown The wither'd heart must fade alone, To spirits nerved by glad desire And pure from each debasing fire, How much it yields of great and good To make existence gratitude! The wielding of colossal pow'rs By which all earth is render'd ours; The Arts that link'd with lovely grace Form paradise round scene and place; The pleasures proud as undefined From fellowship with man and mind— If bliss like this a world display How weak to frown that world away! But, ah! there is a brighter Charm No shade can dim, no cloud disarm; A Star enthroned o'er change and time, Though meek, unmoved; though soft, sublime; A spell beyond the world to break, Which when our eyes this orb forsake Will cling around the parting soul, And gird it with a fond control, For man design'd by Heav'n above, And wafted down in woman's love! That power without whose added spell, So vast yet so invisible, The lustre of our spirit wanes, And pleasures are but smiling pains Is holy Love, by hearts enjoy'd, Unchill'd, unchanged, and unalloy'd! And will the Stoic deem me wrong, A martyr of mistaken song? Without it, what are crowns and kings, But barren toys and blighted things? Art, Wit, and Genius, all we glow To think cold earth contains below, By woman's voice or woman's name Have gather'd fortune, might, and fame. And ask him whom the world hath worn, Whose brain is rack'd, whose bosom torn Amid the dust, the heat and strife Around each day concenter'd, How exquisite that purer life At eve, when he hath enter'd The garden-path where Peace can wind, And cast the demon Care behind! The tottering pace of infant feet That haste a homeward sire to greet; Each budding thought and broken word So faintly seen, and softly heard; The tones of air, the tender hues Affection pours on all it views; And, sweeter far, the eyes which live Upon the rays his own can give, Now kindled into fond excess Of light that speaks, and looks that bless!— To him who feels such blended power They hallow Eve's domestic hour, The Star of life, where'er he roam, Is she whose ray attracts him home. But, godlike is the creature, man! The Past is glittering where he ran Triumphantly his onward track, With prints of glory!—trace them back; Behold him stamp o'er land and sea The might of immortality! To him whom waves nor winds restrain The Elements resign their reign; While cowering Earth and Ocean meet To lay their sceptres at his feet; Whose hand the rock or mountain fells, Or strews the globe with miracles Of form and motion—wondrous Things! Beyond a bard's imaginings; And in his mind there dwells a sense Of Adam's lost pre-eminence, Which yearns for that ideal more Than lip can speak, or thought explore. Yet not because with bolder light The traits of Manhood court the sight, And Action with incessant claim Can summon forth each high-born aim, The softer tints of woman's soul Pervade the world with less control. The Thunder is the king of sound, But ever may the breeze abound, And quiver on melodious wing Where beauty walks, or health can spring: The forest wears inspiring gloom, But yet we seek the flow'ret's bloom; Stern Ocean hath terrific grace Imprinted on his hoary face, But oh! how dear some tranquil dream Which haunts the bank of village stream! And thus, methinks, doth woman's heart A gentler, not less glorious part In Life's dim tragedy fulfil,— The feeblest, but the fairest still: And as in nature charms may be Which all enjoy, though none can see, The light and love of female power Have graced how many a graceless hour, And round the spirit twined a zone Too delicate for eyes to own! Let Valour, Strength, and Wisdom, claim Their summit on the throne of fame; Yet shrinking heart and mind subdued Become the charm of Womanhood; And thoughts that might creation wield, By man's dominion taught to yield, Lie mute and dead in lonely rest And leave the soul but half exprest! For man, not nature, is the power That darkens from its natal hour The mind which decks the softer Race, And dooms them to a second place. But even thus, no formal chain Can frighten, fetter, or restrain That spirit-burst from time to time, When, blazing forth with beam sublime, The mind of Woman proves a spell To make this truth shine visible— That Genius of no sex can be, When radiant with divinity! And though in life her lovely sway Fall dew-like o'er the parchèd day, She rules that noiseless under-tide Of happy thoughts by home supplied. But, see! when peril claims her part, The hero of a woman's heart! Though weak in hand, and frail in form, Her spirit strengthens with the storm; In vain the warning thunders roll,— They rally, not subdue, her soul! Yet earth-born Passion soils her worth With every shade of vulgar earth, Nor dreams her highest glory can Ascend beyond—a slave for man! But vile that soul, however fraught, If pride of sex be only taught: The mind has lost its master-grace, And thoughts demean their lofty race When female love and virtue claim No laurel in the wreath of Fame; While all that Genius should adore Is laugh'd away to live no more! Not thus the bright and perfect One, Whose Blood redeem'd a world undone, Of woman spake, when Man had flown And Mary watch'd and wept alone! Another and a darker race Whose doctrine might the brute disgrace, So vilely from the dust of earth It sprang, to prove its sullied birth!— Oh, name it not, but let it be Entomb'd in voiceless infamy! If he who dares a Shrine deface Where time has left a holy trace, Is branded for his impious zeal By all who ancient glory feel, What damning tones can language find For him who would profane the mind, And dare, with sacrilegious smile, The temple of the soul defile!— Affection, deep as hearts desire, Yet fed by intellectual fire; Those graces felt, but undefined, In gleams and glances of the mind, Developed in a myriad ways, By mien or manner, look or gaze; The tones in dewy cadence heard From lips that harmonise each word, All, all the bright attraction bred, From each fond smile a soul hath shed, Oh! these transcend what Passion's might Can raise to charm her maniac sight. And when Disease's poison'd breath Hath tainted life with hues of death; When time has dimm'd that starry gaze Whose magic thrill'd our younger days, There is a love whose light remains To warm the heart though passion wanes: For beauty born within the mind Admits no mean decay; The Earth may shrink, the Sun grow blind, Ere that dissolve away! Alas! how oft since time began Hath woman been abased by man; To wisdom's rank denied a claim Beyond the worst or weakest aim; Or, doom'd by others, living toys For brutal dreams, or selfish joys! But thou, my England! first to be In heart refined, in spirit free, For ever may the virgin smile Of Woman consecrate thine isle! To guard thee, should fond ocean fail, Thy banners cease to awe the gale, Thy throne become a crushing weight Of tyranny on rank and state, Thy genius and thy glory fled, With each high pulse of freedom dead— E'en then, with female worth to throw Its heavenliness round want and wo, Ruled by the heart's unsullied reign A Kingdom might revive again. But trample once upon that shrine Where Love hath sainted as divine That Beauty which our dreams adore, Religion, virtue, truth, are o'er! And sooner shall Gomorrah rise From out her grave to greet the skies, Than Empires where no morals bloom Awaken from their living tomb! Oh! what a curse for them who can Etherialise the world of man, Yet prostitute a poet's line, To render Woman less divine. A tyrant, when his wrath is o'er, Can break the chain, and back restore The dungeon'd captive into day; And tears may suffer'd wrong allay; And scarce a pang the good endure But some atoning sigh may cure. But what is written—that is writ! No soul-wrung tear may cancel it; Like demons on dark errand sent From out their fiendish element, Polluting Thoughts, by passion fired, Career the world, untamed, untired; From heart to heart their plague is spread, From soul to soul corruption bred, Till myriads by their baneful spell Are tempted to the brink of hell! I envy not the unconfess'd Remorse that gnaws his lonely breast, Who weeps o'er that perverted mind, Whose genius should have graced mankind, Yet bow'd to be the mental slave Of crimes which curse beyond the grave! For when at noon of life he sees His children circled round his knees; Or triumphs in each dimpling grace That dawns within a daughter's face, What pangs with that proud moment cope, What terror blights each blooming hope! Perchance within his dying brain Shall ring some recollected strain, And gloomily those visions throng, Corruption loved to shape in song; And while they darken round his head Portray the crimes their poison bred, Till Fancy hears the parting groan Of souls that shudder'd like his own! Then, not for that unloving race Who scorn each intellectual grace; Or them, whose coarseness would destroy The vestal-bloom of human joy,— Be mine the lay. Yet should there be A heart which loves true heart to see; A father, who has felt how dear The woman whom his thoughts revere; A mother, in whose watchful eye Affections deep and endless lie; A maiden, who hath known how sweet The sister of her soul to greet; Or lover, who in lofty youth Hath pleaded with impassion'd truth To shape of Beauty, by whose light The universe became so bright,— If such the poet's page beguile His guerdon be their grateful smile. Oh! might he wake the richest tones The harp of his enchantment owns, For melody to waft along The spirit of prevailing song, And summon from the caves of Thought Whatever shaping Dreams had wrought,— A bard might think his visions rife With rays of feelings, caught from life. For, in such life what bliss he owed To all that woman's reign bestowed! The smoothest voice, the softest word Delighted moments ever heard; The dearest smile by pity shed To quench the darkness sorrow bred; The shadow of an Angel seen, Where Goodness unobserved had been; And, more than all, devoted truth Whose years retain'd undying youth,— If such a crowd of memory's charms A poet's lyre too feebly warms, It is because no words express The light of Woman's loveliness; And more than Poetry can speak Is mirror'd on her brow and cheek; While feelings oft the most sublime Refuse to be portray'd in rhyme, Though brightly round the heart they throng And seem the archetypes of song:— If doom like this attend my aim, The song, but not the subject, blame! CANTO II. (In relation unto Sentiment). “Yours was the nobler birth, For you from man were made; man but of earth, The son of dust!” —Randolph. ANALYSIS OF CANTO II.

When first the wings of Light unfurl'd Their radiance o'er a new-born World, And choral music, faint and far, Awoke in each melodious star, Until the glowing Earth began To thrill beneath the gaze of man, Ah, who can paint the primal bliss That charm'd an hour divine as this! How beauteous in his dawn of birth Without a shade of sullied earth, Without one touch of deadly sin To mar the perfect soul within, The lord of Eden must have stood, When God beheld, and call'd him, good! Oh! to have heard his lips reveal The first delight that dust could feel; Have listen'd to each wild address He paid to Nature's loveliness; Or, flashing from his heaven-turn'd eye, Have mark'd the spirit's majesty, While round his heart religion stole And mirror'd Him who made the whole! A melody from leaf and flower, Responding to the breeze's power That warbled with exulting tone; A blooming light on all things thrown, On fruit, and foliage, grass, and lake; The song that in sweet gushes brake From birds which flew on fearless wing And taught the very air to sing!— The mute delight, majestic trance Of things that shunn'd no mortal glance, But gazed on man with love or glee And felt that life was amity; While stainless as a pall of light The cope of heaven hung crystal bright, And pour'd upon each perfect limb A lustre which apparell'd him; While ever, as he raised his eye, A seraph, floating through the sky, With gleams of glory track'd his way Or arch'd his wings in beaming play,— Though all like this composed a scene To testify where God had been, A soft disease of soul began To prey upon the bliss of man: A yearning which no language spoke Within his clouded bosom woke; A loneliness with awful weight Lay brooding o'er his desert fate, And darken'd with ideal shade The countenance which heaven display'd; Till sadly was each primal word Upon the placid breezes heard?— “Some other Form, oh! let there be, To live, and love, and roam with me This lone but gorgeous wilderness Of sights that woo, and sounds that bless! A Spirit whom my own can meet, Some hand to hold, some eye to meet; Creator! if thy wisdom can Oh, let there be a mate for man!” More lovely than a vision brought From out the fairy realms of Thought; Serene and silent, with a grace Divinely breath'd o'er form and face, In full array of love and light Which dazzled his adoring sight, By soul and sense to be revered The Angel of the world appear'd. Then, what a starry welcome rang! Each orb an hymeneal sang; While Shapes unutterably bright From heaven gazed down with new delight, When first the ground a woman trod Just moulded by the hand of God! Around her breast, in wreathy play Her locks like braided sunbeams lay; And limbs unveil'd a radiance cast Of purity, as on she pass'd Amid the bloom and balm of flowers Which clustered round elysian bowers; The bird and breeze together blent Their lulling notes of languishment; The Sun grew brighter as he shed His glory round her living head,— As if no conscious thing were free From one fine spell of sympathy, When woman rose upon the scene Creation's fair and faultless Queen! When Adam's trancèd eyelids woke, Thus brightly on his vision broke A living Shape for whom he pined, To share his unpartaken mind. Awhile they gazed in hush'd delight, Each dazzled with the other's sight; Then saw within their mutual eyes Magnetic rays of soul arise, And heard their lips fond tones repeat, And heard their hearts in concert beat, And felt within electric fire Their spirit, blood, and brain, inspire: Then Woman was espoused by Man! The bridal dawn of Love began. Oh! then was born of breathing truth A feeling in ambrosial youth, That soars above the vile decay Of things which time and sense array, And when the dying World departs Still blooms within celestial hearts! And thus, with all that forms a friend The finer tints of love to blend; To soothe the tempest, share the calm, And pour on grief unfailing balm, Did woman on the world appear. And hath she fail'd in life's career?— The Warrior wins a bright renown, The Poet wears a peerless crown, And History with heroic grace Hath laurell'd their triumphant race; But where, in what recording book Can unforgetting Nature look, To count, since first her ages ran, What Woman hath endured for Man? Alas! like dews which night hath felt Within ungrateful earth to melt, And freshen into living flowers The grove that smiles at morning hours, The virtues born of woman's soul, (Though time has drunk their mild control And had by them the heart supplied With what the ruder sex denied) In cold oblivion seem to fade, Unknown, unsung, and undisplay'd! But, might those Spirits who have been Calm Watchers of our troubled scene, Beholding with dejected eye The throes of human agony,— To earth repeat the tale of Life Since first convulsed with gloom and strife, How much, methinks, would Virtue prize That never dazzled mortal eyes, As Angels read the awful story Of Empires dim, and ages hoary, And, while they scorn'd a hero's crown To Woman give the heart's renown! For pangs endured with secret sway, For tears by night, and toils by day; For tortures by the world untraced When love was wreck'd, and truth defaced: For fondness in the fiercest hour Of tyrant wrath, or ruin's power, For every sad and silent wrong That weakness suffer'd from the strong,— For these, and all young Feeling bore When misery made it love the more! A chaplet of celestial light Would Angels weave for Woman's right. Oh! she is all that soul can be In deep, undying sympathy! When life is scarce a moving dream 'Tis like her spirit's native beam, Which never from its fountain strays But lives alone within her rays! And round an infant how divine The wreath a mother's arm can twine? And when dark years of manhood bring Their load of fated suffering, As true as echo to the sound Her blessings to his wants abound! In sickness, ah! how smooth the bed Her duteous hand alone can spread; And, when the shades of Death advance, What paradise within her glance, Where all the yearning soul appears Dissolved in sympathetic tears! Yet scarce had Eden pass'd away And sin begun its blighting sway, Ere woman lost her mental rank And in domestic thraldom sank A Thing to be, whose witching power Might serve to gild a wanton hour, To feed a passion, soothe a frown, Or magnify her lord's renown, But ever, with unvalued heart, In life to play the menial part! And e'en in Greece, that land sublime Whose glory lit the wings of time, E'en there, where Beauty's faultless mould Surpass'd what Sculpture's dreams behold, In vain would truth a model see,— Her love breathes no divinity! From earth it sprung, on earth to live On every charm mere Sense can give; But all proud Sentiment could teach Divine in thought, or pure in speech, By Greece unfelt, or unadmired, Hath scarce one classic page inspired. And Rome, whose wizard banner waved O'er half the isles far Ocean laved, By conquest was not taught to school The passions Heaven alone can rule; But offer'd up each female Right On altars of their stern delight, Where rage might spend its haughty breath And doom a guiltless heart to death. But Rome and Greece, eternal two! Have shown the world what mind can do; And still from them the streams of mind With living freshness charm mankind: Their language in immortal notes Around our list'ning spirit floats; Their genius, throned in classic state, Is haunted by the wise and great; And high-born is the zeal that pays True homage to heroic days When valour woke the lyre of thought, And poets sang the fields they fought! Yet when prevail'd in Greece or Rome The magic of a modern home? There, lives the light our spirit hails! There, beats the heart that never fails; There, smiles beyond a realm to bring Round calmest hours are clustering! Where queens of mild affection reign; The bloom of joy, the balm of pain; And thus are more, when grey or young, Than Homer dream'd, or Maro sung. When first on Rome a tameless horde From forest-depths their myriads pour'd, And down to dust her empire broke, Refinement's moral dawn awoke. The gloomy brow, the glaring eye, The breast which never heaved a sigh, But nurtured in its wild domain The glory of surmounted pain,— Amid them all there lived a sense Of woman's meek pre-eminence; While Chastity within the heart Was shrined beyond pollution's art. Thus, Nature! in thy darkest mood How much remains of bright and good! What Learning in her proudest day, What Genius in her fiery sway, With blended power might never reach, These warriors of the wild could teach! 'Tis pleasant in the storm to see The battle of some glorious tree, Whose branches with resentful play Can awe the beaten winds away; But, beautiful! in calmer hours To view it wave o'er meadow-flowers, And hearken to its whisper mild Like blessing murmur'd o'er a child:— And thus, methinks, the contrast seen When beauty reign'd where war had been; When lion port and eagle eye Had laid their horrid menace by, And, resting in some oaken shade, While round him laughing infants play'd, The savage of the desert grew Refined beneath a woman's view! Next, Chivalry, heroic child, With brow erect, and features wild, Placed Love upon his matchless throne, For Gallantry to guard alone. Then, Woman! in that reign of heart How peerless was thy magic part! A word was more than human breath; A smile dissolved the gloom of death; And Beauty, while it awed the brave, But made the mind a noble slave To Honour, in the chastest light That ruled the soul, or charm'd the sight. And shall we, in a venal age When love hath grown more coldly sage, With frigid laugh and frown decry The bright return of Chivalry? The trumpet-music of the Past, In tales of glory doom'd to last, No longer must one echo stir The pulse of English character? Alas! our life is worldly lore; The reign of heart-romance is o'er; And all which fired heroic toil Hath now become a meaner spoil For time and circumstance to win, While Self is throned secure within.— Yet, valour in its fine excess; A scorn that wither'd littleness; Devotion in its grandest shape And love that sought no mean escape,— Oh! darkly sunk, and vilely sway'd The Clime that wills their might decay'd: But ever prompts each servile art To flourish in th' unweeded heart, Till day by day we learn to see False self is true philosophy! But far beyond all forming powers Which made expressive Beauty ours, In that pure shape by God design'd To soften, soothe, and sway mankind,— Religion, voiced from Heaven, began To rouse the fallen soul of man: Then spirit, by the sense unbound, Arose with grace immortal crown'd: Emotions deep, unstain'd desires, Serener hopes, and chaster fires, Came flowing from a Fount above All freshen'd with ethereal love! 'Twas then that Woman like a star, Whose beam had flutter'd dim and far And shed upon the troubled soul A ray of undiscern'd control,— Advanced above life's daily sphere, Disclosed her radiance, full and near; And kindled for beclouded man The light a Christian woman can. Restored to reign, as fair and good As once in Eden's bower she stood, Companion of the Soul to be In love's avowed fidelity, Religion, when its healing smile First trembled o'er Britannia's isle, By her assuasive meekness won A way to visit hearts undone. And, did her martyr'd spirit quake To front the vengeance of the stake?— E'en there Apostles might have known A faith whose firmness match'd their own: Though limb by limb the fire devour'd, She neither shook, nor shriek'd, nor cower'd, But gloried in the murd'rous flame To sing a martyr'd Saviour's name! And view th' applauded domes which rise In holy grandeur to the skies, How much to female hands they owe Their power to lessen human woe! But ah! how exquisite must be Those charities that none can see, In lovely darkness hid awhile Surrounded with Jehovah's smile! Till, stealing into holy light, They glitter on the pilgrim's sight When haply in some village-dale His soul has drunk the secret tale, How Saintliness a beauty shed Around the dying mourner's bed:— Thus oft upon some travell'd plain, Where Winter holds his bleakest reign, In sudden bloom young flow'rets rise, And blush beneath our gazing eyes. For, leaving oft the splendid home, Unheeded will Compassion roam, And where the roofs of Sorrow lie Give tear for tear, and sigh for sigh; To Famine deal the daily bread, For Sickness hold the drooping head, Be mother to some orphan boy, Make widow'd hearts to sing for joy, And should the parting Soul despair, Points to bright heaven, and Jesu there! And what were life, if woman's heart Attemper'd with no guiding art The household-morals of mankind, Whereby the world is kept refined, And each soft hue opinion wears Its lovely origin declares? Go, find a Land where female grace Is honour'd by no gallant race, And man's dominion deems it vile To bend beneath a woman's smile, But tramples with a brute delight On mental rank and moral right, How darkly do her people sink! How meanly act, how basely think! No loftiness that Clime reveals; No purity her spirit feels; Corruption cankers law and throne, The language breathes a dungeon-tone; And seldom there hath Virtue smiled; But, wither'd, weaken'd, and defiled, It moulders on from age to age The scorn of hero, bard, and sage, And seems on glorious Earth to be A plague-spot, and an infamy! But vain would Truth reflect in song What nameless fascinations throng Around that quiet hearth alone, Where Tenderness hath rear'd its throne. Oh! there are feelings rich but faint, The hues of language cannot paint; And pleasures, delicate as deep, Which like the palaces of sleep Melt into dimness, when the Light Would look upon their fairy sight; And there are chords of happiness Whose spirit-tones our fancy bless, And make the music of our joy Complete, without one harsh alloy; Yet ill can words one note reveal Of melody which mind can feel! But who hath left some calm domain Where Home was charm'd by woman's reign, And trifles through some magic wore An air they never breathed before, And enter'd where a proud abode To ruder man its splendour owed, Nor felt the contrast sternly cold, Like winter o'er his spirit roll'd? Still, there may garden, grove, and bower, Attend on each retiring hour; There Painting with impassion'd glow The poetry of colours show, While volumes rank'd in rich array The heroes of the mind display: But like a face when death has chill'd The light that once each feature fill'd, Contrasted with its living power Beheld in some excited hour, Are homes where single man is seen With those where woman's spell hath been. Alas! for them whose toil-worn days Uncheer'd by Love's adorning rays, In crawling loneliness depart, Yet fret the bloom from out the heart. Though Life, as lord of each desire, To intellectual thrones aspire; May win the laurel, wear the crown, And madden envy with renown, How much beyond what dreams bestow Their loveless hours can never know! With nothing but cold Self to please, The waters of the spirit freeze; And years but harden while they chill A Bosom left unsocial still: And like a tree by autumn shorn Of all that summer-boughs had borne, A leafless, bare, and blighted Thing Where scarce a breeze will deign to sing,— Is Man bereft of that control That emanates from female soul. For heart with heart was born to beat, And soul with soul was made to meet, And sex for sex design'd to be The dawn of endless sympathy. But ye! the laurell'd Host who live A life beyond mere earth to give; The deities of dazzled Thought, To whom her incense aye is brought; Ye Alexanders of the mind Who conquer, but to charm mankind! Enchanters! for the spirit's eyes Remoulding ruin'd paradise; Interpreters! whose tones declare The dialogues of Sea and Air; The priests of Nature taught to praise And worship her mysterious ways; Ye intellectual Kings of time! Triumphant, matchless, and sublime, How fervently your pages own In music of transcendant tone, That Woman in her lovely might Drew worship, wonder, and delight From Souls whose inward glance could see Visions that crowd eternity! Impassioned Lords of deathless song To them the lips of Time belong, As fired with their majestic fame From age to age they sound their name, And bid the world enshrine that scene Where once a worshipp'd Bard hath been;— For hallow'd seems his natal spot Where thrones are crush'd, and kings forgot! And they have earn'd that gorgeous debt Of praise, that Time is paying yet, Who taught us, though it bear the curse, To love the heaven-born universe, And trace wherever goodness trod The lustre of a living God! And glorious is it, when the base Would frown upon Heaven's fairest race, To echo into life again The music of some master-strain; And prove amid the ranks of fame How each who won undying name, In love's applauding eye could see The ruling star of Poetry. Then let me from the poet-throng Who hymned on Earth unearthly song, Select some all-surpassing few, And as they rise in proud review Let him whose spirit ever bow'd Before the passion it avow'd, Whose bosom hath been thrill'd or shaken With dream fulfill'd or hope forsaken,— Exult to find his soul hath felt A charm which could the sternest melt; That lent to genius half its glow, Or taught eternal song to flow; For fancy plumed the wing of fire, And warm'd the soul of every lyre, Whose language was the light of thought From Love by consecration wrought! With paleness on his awful brow Who riseth like a spectre now From darkness, where his fancy dared To wander with an eye unscared, And gaze on Visions such as roll Around that blighted Angel's soul, Who baffles in his dread domain An immortality of pain 'Tis Dante!—whose terrific flight Through caverns of Cimmerian night Imagination vainly tries To track with unappallèd eyes! Severe, august, and sternly great, The gloom of his remorseless fate Around him hung a dismal air Which broodeth o'er intense despair; Till frenzy half began to raise A wildness in his fearful gaze, As, roaming over crag and wood He battled with bleak solitude! For sooner might the maniac roar Of ocean cease to awe the shore When Starlight comes with fairy gleam, Than Pity lull his tortured dream!— Oh! 'tis not in poetic art To paint the earthquake of his heart, The storm of feeling's ghastly strife When she, who form'd his life of life, Had vanish'd like a twilight-ray Too delicate on earth to stay. For Love had heated blood and brain, A fire in each electric vein, A passion whose exceeding power Was heaven or hell to each wild hour! But from the wreck of ruin'd days What gorgeous visions did he raise! Since ne'er was Beauty so divine Embodied in a breathing shrine, As thronèd Beatrice on high In the dark haze of Deity! Her forehead wreath'd with starry light, And she herself,—oh! what a sight On Dante glitter'd, when afar He listen'd to her mystic car, As wafted in a cloud of flowers And guarded by angelic powers In veil of fire her spirit came, And warbled his remember'd name! He bow'd beneath her awful look; Then gazed until his being shook Like water, when the winds convulse And stir it with a quivering pulse. But when the wing'd enchantress soar'd To where the Godhead was adored, Without a shadow, speck, or bound, Eternity lay imaged round! There on some mysterious throne Again he saw her, bright and lone. Ineffably one look she cast Angelic features ne'er surpass'd, On him who knelt entranced awhile Within the glory of her smile; Till lo! in deep excess of light She faded from his yearning sight! As one who leaves a savage dell Where day hath bid the sun farewell, Comes forth to view autumnal beams On bank, and wood, and dimpled streams, Is he who turns from Dante's gloom To see Parnassian flow'rets bloom, As dreams of beauty dawn and glow Along the page of Petrarch's wo. How touching are those mental tears, Delighted throbs and dazzled fears,— The penance by his genius paid Whenever recreant fancy stray'd Beyond the path of pure desire! 'Twas Laura tuned his pensive lyre: Madonna-like, and sweetly mild, And pure as an untempted child, Amid her white-robed virgin-throng He saw her beauty glide along, When lilies deck'd her sun-bright hair Amid the walls of lone St. Claire. That hour became a second birth! Her lustre overveil'd the earth; And never did a Ghebir kneel Before his orb with truer zeal Than Petrarch at that living shrine Where dwelt the soul he knew divine! To him she was a spotless Thing Too bright for earthly lyre to sing; A miracle of life and love, A dream embodied from above, A seraph whose unclouded eyes Reflected back their native skies! From her his inspiration came; Each song enshrined her hidden name; And not a shadow, tint, or sound Creation could produce around, But he beguiled with beauteous art To typify her taintless heart. How fervently his homage glows! Pure from the mind it springs and flows, Exhausting as his numbers roll The life-blood of a feeling soul. For Laura seem'd his spirit's breath, And ruled it when she sunk in death; Then, day and darkness, scene and hour Were haunted with her holy power; And when her smile illumed it not The faded world was soon forgot; Since only to embalm her name He panted for eternal fame! Adorner of the human race! Great Nature's rival, who could trace Her features with such perfect skill That Time can but remould them still, So matchless is that mighty One Whom Fancy now would gaze upon. Go, lend the skies a lovelier blue, Or sunbeams o'er the sunshine strew; Bid Horror to the tempest bring A louder shriek and blacker wing: Or dare suggest a deeper tone To Thunder on his midnight-throne; So powerless seems a poet's line To sing what Shakspeare's works combine! All tears and smiles to him belong; All clouds that round the spirit throng; All passions, principles, and powers Which wring the heart, or rule its hours, In language Nature's lip had taught By him were into action wrought! So truly with creative art He paints the drama of the heart, That long as tears haunt human eyes, Or Pleasure laughs, or Sorrow sighs, Whatever path his genius trod, We hail him earth's poetic god. And round him is a dimness thrown? The colour of his life unknown? While meaner names are chronicled, And baseness in false light beheld, That Masterpiece of mortal clay Unhonour'd did he pass away? Yes, like an orb whose affluent rays Demand of earth no greeting praise, He scatter'd intellectual light Immortal in unconscious might; Sublimely careless of renown Then lay his awful spirit down, Nor dreamt that Glory's arm would wave Her brightest banner o'er his grave! But yet there come faint shadows cast From pining years which he had past, That tell us how the soul could brook Such pangs as once his bosom shook, When dark-eyed Beauty rack'd and wrung A heart round which the world had clung! Her hair was like the sheen of night When blackness seems to make it bright; And melody her touch obey'd When o'er the chords her fingers stray'd; But sorrow dash'd her April years With cold and melancholy tears; And thus there grew a wild unrest Within the gloom of Shakspere's breast, Till he who sung what Romeo felt Beneath like pangs was doom'd to melt, And hide within his dreaming brain The visions of a lover's pain. And well may Woman proudly think That he whose spirit thus could drink Absorbing rays from beauty's eyes, Hath sphered her sex amid the skies! And none like him love's essence knew, From hidden soul the lightning drew, That subtile, secret, silent flame For which the heart hath found no name. There's not a throb that woman feels, There's not a ray her mind reveals, And scarce a blush on brow and cheek When blood would rise and almost speak,— But Shakspere hath the whole divined, And held a mirror to the mind That nature o'er his magic glass Might view each play of feature pass. And what a life-breath'd air there seems To freshen those embodied dreams Where character and grace arise, To feast our unforgetting eyes With all Affection can display, When most we bow beneath her sway! Bright, beautiful, and young, and warm, With tears that melt and tongues that charm, The creatures whom he call'd to birth We pine to meet on mortal earth, And trace by his revealing art The windings of a woman's heart. As moonlight weaves a varied spell O'er rock and mountain, grove and dell, So Love with his transforming beam Hath colour'd each romantic dream, As stern or mild the spirit lay Beneath the spell-work of his ray. A sense of beauty,—it was thine, As deep, as burning, and divine As ever fed with living fire The passion of a poet's lyre, Pale martyr! whom Alphonso's hate Imprison'd for a madman's fate, Because ere yet the lips could speak Emotion had betray'd thy cheek, To tell him how a bard could dare To love a princess—and despair! That love was like a blasting sun, It sear'd the heart it shined upon! But oh, how much of Tasso's strain Was born of his devoted pain, When feelings in their hopeless strife Contended with those clouds of life That 'tween him and his idol grew, Till Death alone could break them through. His youth was lonesome; and the light Of half that won or woo'd the sight, Enchantment from his spirit shed Till earth was heaven beneath his tread! And Nature like a mother smiled On him her musing foster-child; To whom her voice from wave or wind Came with a magic more refined Than echoes from the human soul: And where a quiet stream did roll While shade and sunshine blent their power, He charm'd his own creative hour; Till voiceless aspirations rose, His bosom lost its young repose, And round his heart a Syren came Who murmur'd his immortal name! Thus fancy set the soul on fire, Till life itself he found aspire To beauty, like that spirit bright; When, tender as the touch of light, Fair Leonora's vision stood Before him, fresh in womanhood! And all the heart's creation drew At length his living eyes could view. What heavenliness arrayed her form! How exquisite the blushing storm Of love's betray'd emotion rose! When Tasso read his lyric woes, And saw her eye's transparent blue Bedimm'd with soul dissolving through! Morn after morn, in youth's ripe age, He read his own melodious page, While Leonora's lips of love The garland of his glory wove In words whose magic seem'd to be The tones of immortality! And could they side by side remain Nor feel the heart's delicious pain? The might of that magnetic gaze That each to each would softly raise? Could Tasso in such perill'd hour Be dead to passion's dawning power? Alas for him!—Alphonso came And bade a dungeon hide his flame! They tore him to a hideous cell, (Ferrara hath revered it well) And left him, for a maniac's doom, To rot in suffocating gloom! Yet misery could not then decay The dream that wore his mind away: Though frenzy might its faith destroy Till life became a wretched toy, Yet Passion round his wreck would smile, Like Evening o'er a faded pile: But when his Leonora died And every bard a wreath supplied To grace the glory of her bier, Could Tasso's Muse deny a tear? Yes! silence was the tomb of pain, And grief was voiceless, when 'twas vain. Let fancied wo prepare a sigh To deck the fate of those who die; And hypocrites their cheeks array With gloom to serve a venal day, The pangs which load a loftier breast Lie deep, and dark, and unexprest; Yet sternness in that blank despair Hath buried more than anguish there! Another of the wondous see! Whose spirit talk'd with Deity, And, blind on earth, beheld in heaven The glory to archangels given, When robed in light their garments blaze And whiten in eternal Rays! No cavern'd prophet while he felt A trance almighty round him melt; Or by some Babylonian stream From darkness shaped his awful dream Wherein there glided, vast and dim, The cloud-apparell'd cherubim, Hath scarce outsoar'd his epic flight Who sang of Chaos, Death, and Night! Had none, methinks, but Milton's song Pour'd its grand tide the world along; Had never page but his reveal'd The miracles in mind conceal'd, The hope immortal still would rest Unblighted in our human breast; For never could some narrow grave Th' immeasurable soul enslave, Which compass'd air, and heaven, and hell, As lord of his creative spell! With what a melody divine The river of each noble line Flows onward!—faint, or loud, or deep, Accordant to the numbers' sweep. Go, enter some majestic fane And listen to the organ-strain, When melting clouds of music float Down the dim aisles with blending note; Now with wild melodious thunder The vaulted pavement echoes under, Then, aloft in flights of sound The winged harmonies abound, Evanishing like birds that stray And skyward sing their boundless way!— E'en thus can Milton's numbers roll Their cadence o'er a trancèd soul. And can we deem that he who drew In lines of love so brightly true The Mother of our mortal race, And made the lustre of her face To dazzle back a Demon's guile, When Eden laugh'd beneath her smile, Reflected not through poet's art The paradise of his pure heart? The Lady-pilgrim of the wood In star-like beauty, lone and good, Was copied from a shape, perchance, That kindled youth's adoring glance. There is a tale—and let it live Such life as fond romance can give,— That once as slumb'ring Milton lay In umbrage from the noon-warm day, Beneath the twilight of a tree, That arch'd its waving canopy, A maiden saw his sleeping face And, spell-bound with its beauteous grace, Her wonder in sweet song express'd And placed it on the poet's breast;— “If eyes when shut the heart can take, How bright their vict'ry when awake!” Oh! who can tell what beauty flow'd From feelings by such words bestow'd? The Eve of his enchanted thought From hues of nature's heaven was wrought, And she of paradise the queen Embodied what his soul had seen. And could that Bard, whose mind was free And boundless as eternity; Who seem'd on earth to have the skies Aye floating o'er his mental eyes; To the low dust of life descend And with the base its glory blend? How nobly hath awarding Time For Genius shaped the crown sublime, And silenced in oblivion's shade The war Opinion's fury made! Till all the wounds and stabs of strife Which agonised his bleeding life Appear but like a mould'ring stain That lingers on some marble fane, But ere it rots one tint away Hath vanish'd in some heavenly ray! Oh! many are the pangs that wear A spirit into proud despair; And many are the tears which flow, To swell the tide of human wo: But seldom doth the sicken'd heart From dreams of false perfection start With pangs of such convulsive power As when the great have ceased to tower, Desert the sky, and fold their wings To strive with earth's degraded things, Like eagles when their flight is o'er That wrangle on some weedy shore! But one amid the poet-throng To whom the wreaths of heaven belong, From pride and coarser impulse free Stands out, in solemn purity!— His heart, by woman's power array'd, The summons of high love obey'd, And beautiful, beyond the light Of language to reveal aright, The passion of a deathless pair, Who breathed on earth celestial air! Before the dawn of being came They dreamt their lot was doom'd the same, And human love in heaven would be A wedded immortality! And when his Meta dying lay And felt her spirit faint away, Like music from a falt'ring wave When sinking to its ocean grave, Beside her Klopstock meekly stood, And watch'd the pale and speaking blood In awful changes come and go! But never was such loving wo, When Meta, to his fond request That round him her bright wings should rest While o'er the world his fate must rove,— Responded with a burst of love, “Who would not share that lot divine, To be thine angel! thou art mine!” A gentle stream which glides along And tones the breeze with lovely song; And that same stream, when torn at length And arm'd with desolating strength As down some rocky steep it pours, And like a rival ocean roars, May typify the tranquil soul When calm'd by virtue's wise control, And one by passion's whirlwind force Compell'd to each disastrous course. 'Tis thus, when sad-eyed memory turns From Klopstock to impassion'd Burns, Two streams of life at once appear In mild repose and mad career. The Shakspeare of the woods and fields, How wizard-like the sway he wields! The heart-blood owns his lyric might And ripples with confess'd delight When Scottish valour fires the song, Like clarion-music, stern and strong! Excitement, that immortal pain, The demon of a poet's brain, On him it wreak'd its wildest rage! And all that poverty could wage Against a high and haughty mind His trampled heart was doom'd to find. Yet, cradled in dark misery's bed, How nobly was his genius led! What Man denied, great Nature gave: His soul, no educated slave, The Elements and Seasons taught, Creation magnified his thought; And when amid the foliage dim The blackbird piped his vesper-hymn, Or round him, like a lustrous pall He felt the Day's bright curtain fall, As tides th' attractive moon obey, So throbb'd his pulse to Nature's play. And Woman by her smile could throw A sunbeam o'er his blackest wo,— A ray whose beauty reach'd the soul And bade his burning numbers roll! Yet who can read the bitter fate So darkly chill and desolate, That brooded o'er the closing day Of him who sang as proud a lay As ever rose from Scottish lyre On inspiration's breath of fire, Nor weep to think that starless night Should blacken round a soul of light! Or, who can mark his mind's undress, The agony of lone distress, The curse of want that crush'd his brain To frenzy, with a fiercer pain!— Can hear the groan of anguish'd hours When Misery rallied all her powers, And thoughts like hidden scorpions tore The mind that could no longer soar, But prostrate in its ruin lay A blasted wreck and bleeding prey,— Nor ask for Pity's brightest tear To tremble on his early bier! Yet warmly while around him shone The worship that his genius won, Prophetic truth beheld afar The cloud that would conceal his star, And leave him, long ere life should close, To wither in degrading woes! Yes, he whose lines are mottoes now, Whose genius veils his Country's brow With glory, when his stirring lays Are greeted with exalting praise, Was fated like an outcast thing To moulder in dark suffering Down to the grave, with scarce a bed To pillow his immortal head! Alas! how little can the great Feel the dread curse of blighted fate; Or think that they, whose spirits throw Around the world a heavenly glow, Whose bright imaginations seem The fragments of a Seraph's dream, Whose words imparadise the hours And freshen earth with Eden-flowers,— The martyrs of the mind have been Or suffer'd more than eye hath seen! For, while the theme of Glory's tongue, Their homes were wreck'd, their hearts were wrung; And songs which flow'd so gaily free Gush'd from a fount of misery! A noble Mind in sad decay When baffled hope hath died away, And life becomes one long distress In bleak and barren loneliness, Methinks 'tis like a ship on shore, That once defied th' Atlantic roar, And gallantly through gale and storm Hath ventured her majestic form; But now in stranded ruin laid By winds and dashing seas decay'd, Forgetful of her ocean-reign, Must crumble into earth again! To crown the lyric throng appears Another, whose poetic tears, While a bruised spirit toils below Shall consecrate Affection's wo; And ever by their passion tell The power of love's unfading spell, Which beautified with lone despair The visions that his lines declare. The anguish of his riven heart Hath ceased on earth to play its part, And o'er his laurel-shaded brow The damp of death lies coldly now! The storm, the shadow, and the strife That made and magnified his life, Have sunk like winds along the deep And left him to untroubled sleep: But few, when Harold died, forget The fulness of our fond regret, As England echoed back the knell Which toll'd from Greece his last farewell! Oh! nought but some ignoble breast Where feelings, iced in stony rest, Can baffle with a stern disdain The lightnings of each lofty strain, That did not unto tears admire The dirges of his gloomy lyre, And speculate, if years had brought A blessed store of brighter thought, How much of all which mars his fame Had vanish'd in some purer aim.— The earthquake that so rock'd his soul With dread and undefined control, Beneath some intellectual balm Had soften'd to melodious calm: Those feelings which were prompt to stray Where all the weeds of vileness lay, And linger with sarcastic stress Round Nature's erring littleness, As though in man no trait was true But that which wore the meanest hue And Goodness were a dream that dies When dazzled by a poet's eyes,— Yes, feelings dark as these, perchance Had glorified by pure advance The regions of exalted mind, And loved the links of human-kind. The spots upon Creation seen For sorrow, not for scorn, had been, And genius, from its darkness free, Flash'd out in full divinity! But, 'twas not so; and man must wait The brightness of a better fate, To tell him all which Grief would learn, When back to dust the great return, E'en in that hour when most they seem To realise our noblest dream, And purify the hopes of Earth With promise of a second birth. The sanctity of Virtue stands Above the soil of human hands, And Genius, though the world it awe, Must bow to her corrective law: Yet who, unless his mind can be Transform'd to perfect Deity, Can judge how terrible the sway When Impulse leads the soul astray? The meanest tongue can brand a sin, But who can probe the heart within,— The gloom of agonising strife When Principle resigns its life, Till Passion in her fiery reign Pours madness over blood and brain! A soul, that like Æolian lyre Which faintest tones of air inspire, Was thrill'd by sound, and hue, and scene, As though its slumber ne'er had been; A spirit, pining for the good Till dreams became its daily food; Or revelling in satiric gloom Which mock'd at all above the tomb,— Oh! these unite to arm a spell That few below have wielded well! And, blended with a slakeless thirst To find the spot by crime uncursed, In Byron lived a haunting dread From moods of dark inquiry bred, Of that Unknown beyond the grave Where fancy's wings delight to wave: Hence, doubt and scorn, with anguish rife, Threw blackness on the stream of Life; Till o'er each maze of erring man The reckless eye of Satire ran, Which finding nought but error free, Call'd vice the sole reality! But where the grave of Harold lies May Virtue bend forgiving eyes! The meek, whose time-worn spirits know How much that Heart must brave below When battling with the mystic gloom Which haunts it from the spectral tomb, No vengeance on his glory wreak But softly of each error speak. For who are they, if life had been, Like Byron's, one uncurtain'd scene Where every eye could point a gaze And level all its envious rays, Whose splendour would reveal no blot Which now lies faded and forgot? While some regard with bitter eyes The tomb where buried Genius lies, And bid the gates of Mercy close On them whom Earth denied repose,— The hearts that wisdom's humbling power Has taught to fear the firmest hour, In tender awe will bend and weep Where Byron's noble ashes sleep, Nor love o'er sorrow's wildering track To trace the foot of Error back; But thank him with a proud excess For all the poet's mightiness! Oh, there he lies! becalm'd in death, Whose being was a tortured breath; Whose years in whirlwind bore him on To the dread gulf where time is gone! And stirless as the travell'd lake Whose waters down the mountain break O'er wood and wild, and ridge and rock, Convulsed and crash'd with many a shock, The turbulence of trial now!— The rest can God alone avow. And was it nought to melt away The frost that bound the spirit's play? To summon into startling view The deep, the daring, and the true, Or light the chaos of the soul And see its hidden waters roll! Instead of polish'd rhyme, to raise The stormy breath of wilder lays; Or make us, in his milder hour, Dissolve in dreams of beauty's power— Such beauty as our thoughts create, But never clad a mortal state! There are who call the Poet's bliss Too airy for a world like this: Alas, for Wisdom! if her voice Can teach the heart no glorious choice; If downward to the dust she try For aye to fix our slavish eye, And seldom bid one glance be given Aloft to mind's unclouded heaven! The freshness of poetic thought From out the groves of Fancy brought, And wafted o'er the soul's domain, What is it, but a breezy strain From winds of vanish'd Eden lent To purify earth's element, And summon forth those dream-born flowers That grew in Milton's epic bowers! 'Mid all the waste of worldly arts Oh! leave him yet some few fine hearts, That still the Poet's wand may raise A vision of unfallen days, And rescue from the fangs of time Some feelings that are yet sublime! On Harrow, when the heaven of June Was garmented with glowing noon And not a cloud's minutest braid Along its liquid sapphire stray'd, I stood beneath that haunted tree, And heard the leaf-toned melody Which oft in Boyhood's dreaming years Had warbled on the pensive ears Of Byron,—when he loved to muse Beneath the quiet churchyard-yews. Oh! who in such an hour could stand And look adown the sloping land Where meadow, vale, and roving stream So often charm'd his chequer'd dream; And round him feel the fresh-wing'd air That lifted oft his waving hair, And press the same sepulchral stone His pressure loved to make its own, Nor feel a sense of fame and might That shook the heart with strange delight? 'Twas here he mused in Fancy's bower; And in the mind's prophetic hour Would try with telescopic gaze To read the brow of unborn Days, Hail the bright orb of future fame And glory in a minstrel's name! Or dared with dreadless eye to see A map of vision'd misery In lines of awful length outspread, Till darkness veil'd him with the dead! And who with backward gaze can scan The burning course his genius ran, Nor feel how Woman's reigning star With fervid eye he view'd afar, And felt her beam of beauty cast A light which heaven alone surpass'd! His primal love—it never died, But still within the soul supplied The waters of affection pure From fate and freezing time secure. 'Twas thence ideal sorrow drew The pangs which pierce our nature through, Till love became the breath of song, And bore his inward life along. But had his heart with hers entwined Whose beauty struck his boyhood blind, The starlight of whose cloudless eyes Attracted his immortal sighs, If happiness could reach the great How bright had been his alter'd fate! Instead of darkness, light would be Around the soul's divinity! Medora, Kaled, and Gulnare, Each ruin'd maid and reckless fair, Were vision'd from the shades of mind Despair and passion leave behind. But, once in home's attractive fane Oh! had he worshipp'd woman's reign, And seen her, not in mock romance, Through daily paths of life advance As angel of domestic hours, How nobly might those lofty powers He lavish'd on a Corsair's bride Have been to purer love supplied! While, feeling all which fancy drew, His genius would have brighten'd too, And Woman in his picture hail'd A model that had never fail'd, While love, by genius made divine, Could sanctify a poet's line. And such hath been fond Woman's sway Since angels hymn'd her natal day, By law of that instinctive love Whose archetype is God above! And while yon heaven is o'er us hung For ever shall the brave and young, The free, the fervid, fond and true, Declare what female hearts can do! And many a name as yet unknown, Embalm'd in some immortal tone Of genius, by a thrilling bard, Shall Time exult to read and guard: And Beauty, in domestic bowers Now fameless as secluded flowers, When buried queens forgotten lie And royal tombs can raise no sigh, In melody of deathless might Shall live to be the World's delight, While Love and Poetry can claim To twine a wreath round Woman's name!

Angel of life! whose love hath been The master-charm of time and scene, Romance in her Elysian mood Creating forms of fair and good, Hath not outsoar'd thy virtue's height, Nor imaged forth more purely bright Those lineaments of perfect grace Which yet adorn thy breathing race; For Fiction, when her mould was cast, On truth might gaze, and feel surpass'd. But where is woman most array'd With all that mind would see display'd? O England! round thy chainless isle How lavishly all blessings smile, And crowd within thy little spot A universe of glorious lot! But never till the wind-rock'd sea Have borne us far from home and thee, Thy purer charms we learn to prize And feel the patriot's glow arise.— Though Nature with sublimer stress Hath stamp'd her seal of loveliness On climes of more colossal mould, How much that travell'd eyes behold Would sated wonder throw away To take one look where England lay!— To wander down some hawthorn-lane And drink the lark's delightful strain; Or floating from a pastured dell To hear the sheep's romantic bell, While valeward as the hills retire Peeps greyly forth the hamlet-spire, And all around it breathes a sense Of weal, and worth, and competence. But, far beyond all other dowers, Thy daughters seem Earth's human flowers.— The charm of young Castilian eyes When lovingly their lashes rise, And blended into one rich glance The lightnings of the soul advance,— Wild hearts may into wonder melt And make expression's magic felt. Or, girded by the dreams of old, In Sappho's Lesbian isle behold A shadow of primeval grace Yet floating o'er some classic face: But where, in what imperial land Hath Nature with more faultless hand Embodied all which Beauty shows Than round us daily lives and glows? Here, mingled with the featured might Of charms that coldest gaze invite, Th' enamel of the mind appears Undimm'd by wo, unsoil'd by years! To wedded hearts devoid of strife Here Home becomes the heaven of life; And household-virtues spring to birth Beside the love-frequented hearth, While feelings soft as angels know Around them freshly twine and grow. A landscape of domestic love Which God's paternal eyes approve, Reflected from a homely dream, Shall form my lay's concluding theme: If there one heart its home can see, 'Twill render more than fame to me! A vale of beauty!—lo, the Morn In clouds of crimson radiance born, Hath risen from the couch of night And fills the air with fresh delight; While hues, like harmonies that range The world of sound with lovely change, In varied lustre o'er the sky Awaken, mingle, melt, and die; Till full-orb'd on his flaming throne The sun-King is beheld alone! And blue as Baltic waves asleep Before him lies a dazzling sweep Of azure,—in its deep excess Of morn-created loveliness. How exquisite this breathing hour! As though awhile some choral bower Where Cherubim partake repose, Its crystal gates did half unclose, Till fragments of delicious sound Came wafted on the winds around, And bloom and balm to nature given Made earth a momentary heaven! Hark! to the choir of yonder wood Where life exults in solitude; On each unrifled bough is heard The lay of some melodious bird, And young-wing'd breezes as they float From brook and meadow learn a note; And streams like tides of gladness, flow And in the earth there dwells a glow Of elemental youth and joy Unchill'd by one corrupt alloy. How dazzlingly with rosy dyes The fairies of the field arise! And flutter on their insect-wings, As each a song of matin sings; And where around the glitt'ring blade A liquid web of dew is laid, As early peasants' footsteps pass, How greenly shines the shaken grass! While many a lark from out the ground Is startled, like a magic sound Which ere the sense be half aware Comes trembling through the lyric air! And list, from out yon village-dell, Upon the breeze in broken swell, The goings-on of life begin To charm the ear with social din. The creak of hill-ascending wain, The shout of some exulting swain, The watch-dog baying far behind, The mill-sounds hoarse upon the wind, With voices from the child or crone, Are all in gay confusion thrown; And murmur on the morning-breeze; With notes whose human echoes please. From the thatch'd chimney now have broke The tinted wreaths of cottage smoke, Ascending delicately bright, And braided by a golden light, Like air-wing'd hopes that glide away Commingling with the boundless day. And see! amid the straw-roof'd throng Of homes that to yon dale belong, As dwelt the patriarch on the plain Surrounded by his pastoral train, A mansion smiles; whose neater state Though unallied to proud or great, A central grace around it throws And o'er each cot a charm bestows. Embower'd in laurels, green and calm, To view it yields the eye a balm: But when at eve its garden hath A lustre on each lilied path; When bough, and branch, and grape-hung vine In rays of pensive beauty shine, While gladsome bee and quiring bird And leafy song are faintly heard, There often hath the worldling cast A longing eye, ere on he past, And while it wander'd o'er the scene, Mused, Oh! that such my own had been! But is it like gay hearts that hide With sunny brow a bitter tide Of anguish in their gloom below, Which they who suffer only know? Have venom'd passions, fierce or wild, The pureness of its peace defiled, While outwardly its walls declare Life's inner-world most tranquil there? No: war and famine, blood and crime Have stain'd the ghastly scroll of time; And tears, the rain of torture, flow'd, And conscience borne its burning load While twenty years o'er earth have roll'd, The aged die, and youth grown old; Yet still, in unalloy'd content Remains yon blissful tenement! And, save the shadows which o'ersteal The brightest fate the good can feel, Around its heaven-protected scene A summer of the soul hath been! And like a fount whose waters fling A freshness with faint murmuring, Perceived alone by desert-flowers That bud beneath its nursing powers, From thence hath Charity's sweet store Been scatter'd for the sick and poor. So noiseless were the feet that trod Those lovely paths which led to God, That Angels only heard their tread, And track'd them to some dying bed. But where the ivied gate expands, Within it what a vision stands! More exquisite in brow and limb Than those aërial cherubim, Which painting in some starry dress Reveals on clouds of loveliness! Around her like a viewless zone A fascinating might is thrown: Her brow is pure as thought can be And whiter than the foam-clad sea, Expanded with an arch of grace Like heaven's above a heavenly face; And on that polish'd cheek, behold Her ringlets, by the breeze unroll'd, In gleaming motion dance and shake Like ripples on a restless lake. Her years are on the verge of heaven,— That period when to life is given The freshness of elastic youth Yet touch'd with woman's deeper truth, Again, behold that virgin face! 'Tis beauty in the mould of grace; Incarnate soul lies sculptured there; A feeling so divinely fair Is dwelling in those dark-fringed eyes, That when they front congenial skies Pure spirits well might deem that Earth Had copied some celestial birth, Or beauty in the world had grown All spirit-like, to match their own! Yet innocence with homely seal Hath stamp'd the power her looks reveal; And should her form the rustic meet Amid some pent and crowded street, So artlessly each lovely hue Would dawn on his delighted view, At once his mental eye would roam To scenery round a village-home, Till breeze and brook were heard again Exulting o'er his native plain. Companion of the morning hours To tend her own infantine flowers, Which grow beneath her guardian eyes, And let their lids of bloom arise, The garden-haunt she loves to pace: And oft is seen, with bending grace, And hand that scarcely wounds the air, To nurse each bud unfolding there; Till Fancy where her touch presides Might dream the soul of flowers abides, And wafts abroad their sweetest sigh To greet her, as she glideth by. Before her nought is forced to flee: All undisturb'd, the rifling bee When hived in bloom, may hum and sip A banquet off the rose's lip: The butterflies, bright gems of air!— Can hover round her silken hair; And not a bird that quells its song, Or flutters when she moves along, But sings as though a sunbeam came Athwart the boughs with brighter aim. 'Twas here amid this haunt of dreams Her childhood roved, and still it seems Alive with voices heard of yore, And breathes of them who breathe no more! From out her casement's vine-clad height She views it, when the veil of night Lies dimly woven over all, Or glitters like a dewy pall: And here, when starry magic reigns Amid the sky's nocturnal plains, And moonlight with mysterious power Hath mantled yonder grey church-tower; The pensive maiden loves to stand And let her night-born dreams expand.— Nor is the scene bereft of charm: The dusky roof of distant farm, The meadows in their dim array, The frowning coppice far away, And cot that shows its twinkling pane Adown the lone and green-bough'd lane, While yonder where the cloven hill Seems parted by a Tempest's will, The billows wreathed with moonshine play And warble forth an occan-lay,— To hearts that feel the hush of night Enchanting is their mingled sight! A daughter, beautiful and good, On the fair brink of womanhood, When all the debt of love-watch'd years, Of buried pangs and bosom'd fears, By filial worth can be repaid, Is more than words have yet portray'd. What links, which time nor death can part, Have bound her to a parent's heart! Oh, deep beyond description lies, Pure as the ray of seraph-eyes, The love within parental souls! Whatever tide of anguish rolls, Whatever wreck the world can make, Till God himself the good forsake Affection is the life of life, A power with more than feeling rife Above all base dominion free, A passion for eternity! O, blest! unutterably blest, The visions to their fancy prest, When sire and mother blend a prayer For thee, young spirit! fond as fair. Thy being sways their mortal breath, And shouldst thou die,—'twere more than death: For in thy tomb their thoughts would dwell, And darkness be their brightest spell. To think on all thine artless ways Since childhood reap'd its golden days; From year to year delighted trace The magic dawn of mind and face; To watch thee in Life's daily round With every trait of heaven abound; And when some friend, whom time endears, Hath warbled in their trancèd ears Of noble acts in secret done, And wreaths by silent virtue won, Oh, then around their hearts to feel A glow of admiration steal!— Or haply, with prophetic truth To picture for thy wedded youth A Soul that shall be worthy thine, With feelings from as pure a mine; And when the church-yard yews shall wave And darken o'er their cherish'd grave, To feel, whatever time decree, One Heaven their final home will be, A bliss so pure no words unfold, A joy so deep no eyes behold; That language must be taught Above Whose power reveals a parent's love! And thou art worthy, on whose brow The stainless mind lies mirror'd now, Around their guardian hearts to twine Those feelings that are so divine! No wish, or want, or hope, or joy, No dreams of time thy youth employ, But blended with their meaning lies Approval shed from parent eyes. And as a ray from out the sun Reveals its birth where'er it run, Thy virgin thoughts, howe'er they stroll, Retain the brightness of the soul. And often in thy sleep is heard The fragment of some duteous word, When lips of imaged parents seem To bless thee in thy girlish dream. How winning are those myriad ways By which a child fond homage pays, Those ministries of heart and hand Which none but parents understand! When Morning reigns in dewy power, To hie and cull the choicest flower; Or pluck the fruit whose bloom appears Bedeck'd with Night's refreshing tears; Or else with magic pencil take The likeness of some hill or lake, Some haunted spot, whose beauty hung Rich praises on her feeling tongue, And these to place in proud surprise Before a mother's greeting eyes!— Affection, let thy voice declare How tender-sweet such trifles are! For what is kindness, but the heart In action, without guile or art, Imparting by some nameless power A bloom to each attractive hour? But when bleak winter bares the earth And Comfort hails the wonted hearth, Then, child of beauty! thou art found The central star of bliss around. Some book divine, or antique tale, Or shipwreck, where the savage gale Swells howling o'er the black-waved sea, Perchance, the chosen page may be: Or Bard eterne with visions bright Shall charm the soul of taste to-night; Or haply, Music's heaven-born spell Whose spirit thou canst wake so well, Shall melt fond memory into tears Or votive sighs, for vanish'd years: And then, adown the tides of song While thou enrapt art borne along, The throbbing chamber seems to glow With Melody's rich overflow! And full before his bick'ring fire, Delighted sits a dreaming sire; Nor blame the mother, if her gaze Be fill'd with more than fondest praise, And Nature whisper through the heart, “My child, how exquisite thou art!” But, 'tis not in the noon of joy When Life endures no stern alloy, A daughter from her mind can pour The fulness of affection's store: For let but once a pang prevail, A limb be rack'd, or cheek grow pale; Let the wild torture of disease Deny to heart and hand their ease; Let sorrow once her frown impress On Earth's uncertain happiness,— Then, scorner of the sex! advance, And learn the power of Pity's glance, The tender might of woman's gaze Unweaken'd by tormented days. Through hours of blackness, when the mind Seems prostrate, wreck'd, and unresign'd, What pathos in her pleading eye! How gentle her devoted sigh! One look speaks more than man could say, And each word wafts a pang away. And there are ties whose thrilling truth Pervade her uncorrupted youth With energies that breathe and move In daily acts of duteous love. Behold yon sister!—fairy thing Whose forehead, like the brow of spring, Is ever-bright and ever-young, And with the glow of gladness hung; So light in form, a breeze of life Secure from earth's contagious strife, Round her own orb of home and glee On wing'd delight she seems to flee! Each pulse within her fine-wrought frame Is tuned to joy's unsleeping claim; Whether a cloud-isle richly drest Her wonder-beaming eye arrest, Or magic from some household-word Young laughter into life hath stirr'd. And dear as Nature's dearest tie She grows beneath a sister-eye, Who watches with a star-like gaze Around her pure but perill'd days. And rather than the air might press Too bleakly on her loveliness, Or pain one fleeting pang awake, Would let the blood her heart forsake, And drop by drop dissolve away To win her life one pangless day! And what, though years now intervene To veil her own from childhood's scene, To robe an infant's face with smiles And summon forth its mimic wiles, As playmate she can stoop to be Transform'd to frolic infancy! Will echo back the bird-like sound Of tiny laughs in merry round, Nor coldly shun the meanest toy That wings a moment's flight with joy. And well those cherub-features play In answer to her sister's sway, Delighted, calm, or grief-array'd, According as her words display'd The tones which govern smiles and tears! And often when some cloud appears, By pain, or temper's gloom begot, To shadow her infantine lot, That sister can alone restore The sunshine as it play'd before! And duly as the car of Night Returns, she bends with soft delight Enamour'd o'er the precious sleep Of lids too beautiful to weep! No, never is the pillow prest Before a parting gaze hath blest That winning face!—so brightly warm, So tinted with the rosy charm Of slumber, that its beauty seems The bloom of amaranthine dreams. But ah! there is a dearer task Whose toils a patient wisdom ask; And who beyond a sister knows Where best the germ of knowledge grows, When Infancy begins to look Abroad o'er Earth's unwritten book, To read the world with curious eye, And question truths beyond the Sky! Fondly to aid the budding mind When thought springs faint and undefined; To teach her lips a word to frame And prattle with some homely name; Then day by day, as reason wakes And mental twilight dimly breaks, A delicate enchantment throw Round each young truth the heart would know, Thus nursing with a sweet control The childhood of a cherish'd soul,— O none but she can paint the joy Of such divine and dear employ! In wing'd delight thus years will speed, And still in language, look, and deed, Will sisterly affection be A power of guardian purity, And gently thus its magic wind Around an infant's growing mind. A brother!—oh, that thrilling name, It vibrates through thy very frame Thou queen of Boyhood's cloudless day! In studious bower though far away, Thy heart is haunted with a sense Of all a brother's charms dispense. His picture on thy bedroom-wall, How frequently its lines recal Th' imperial face, the manly brow, The eyes which dared the soul avow And smile that knew no mean eclipse But ever round those graceful lips In brightest welcome play'd for thee In moods of unaffected glee!— What tales of prowess, feats of mind Around thy memory intertwined, 'Tis pure delight to oft unroll In tones that touch parental soul! Beside thee like a felt unseen The shadow of his shape hath been, Whene'er along some favour'd walk Thy spirit dreams him smile and talk; His voice is woven in the breeze That carols round the garden-trees; And fancy, when the moon gleams bright, Can often on its mirror write Emotions 'twas divine to share, When both had fix'd their glances there! Through weal and wo, through cloud and change, Whatever clime or shore he range, Till nature can itself deny Undimm'd will shine affection's eye, And stainless those deep waters prove That well from out a sister's love! And think'st thou, though thy smile afar Hath vanish'd like a fairy star, Companion of her girlish lot! That thou art in thy home forgot, Where memories like pulses play Within the heart of each new day? So long our early feelings last, Affection owns no faded past! For aye the glow of what was dear Surrounds it like an atmosphere; Eternal is the youth of thought, Whatever outward change hath wrought, And distance, though like death it seems, Is conquer'd by creative dreams Of fondness, acting o'er again The brother in his spirit-reign! For, all he fancied, felt, or did, Her memory in fond silence hid, And nought is trivial, wreck'd, or gone, He cherish'd, loved, or gazed upon! Like gems of earth his flowers abide, With dew and tender rain supplied; The birds are fed with fostering care, His dog beneath the wonted chair In unalarm'd repose may lie And fawn to win her playful eye; The glossy steed, whose bounding limb O'er hill and mead had toil'd for him, Beside it she will often stand With greeting voice and gentle hand; The page he read grows doubly sweet, For there communing thoughts can meet: Each melody whose magic sway Could best dissolve his soul away,— Delightful 'tis again to pour Around the room its richest store Of melting sounds, which ere they die Seem blended with a brother's sigh!— But holier far is memory made, And deeper is its might display'd Whene'er the poor he loved to feed, The hearts he caused no more to bleed, She welcomes in some rustic cot, And finds his goodness unforgot! And ye, whose locks with hoary truth Betray the flight of faded youth; Whose hands have rock'd the cradled boy, Or ere he lisp'd his little joy, Full proudly may your tongues prevail! For dear is each domestic tale The homely past untreasures now To brighten on a sister's brow! But when arrives his well-known seal, What ecstacy young eyes reveal! Warm on the page her lips impress A kiss of perfect happiness; And well in that entrancing hour When feelings claim prophetic power, Since all unworn his heart appears, A sister may outwing the years, And vision round a brother's head The rays of future glory spread! And wouldst thou trace her secret tide Of goodness to the poor supplied, Winding unknown its village-course From charity's divinest source? Angelic woman! if to be On earth a child of Deity, Surpasseth all we deem renown, How peerless thine immortal crown! For shipwreck'd hearts, sole haven thou; With pity on thy pensive brow, And mercy in thy healing hand, And voice beyond all music bland, From cot to cell, oh! thou hast been Life's angel in its blackest scene, And often with the dying good On the bright verge of Heaven hast stood! And such thou art; and many a dame Delights to hear thy darling name; And many a tatter'd widow glows To bless the hand that heal'd her woes: While orphan babes in lane and street With bright'ning face thy welcome meet: And many a tale of mercy lives The life which grateful Memory gives, When Feeling round a cottage-fire Can pay the debt thy deeds inspire! And they are such as cannot die Though honour'd by no human eye; Unchronicled in rolls of worth, Ungreeted by applauding earth, Silent and secret though they be, Their tablet is eternity! Where graven by the Hand Divine The glories of the good will shine. And thus in virgin solitude, Unbroken by the waters rude Of that rough world, whose waves afar Billow with life's tempestuous war, Queen of the hamlet! years have flown, And still thou art unwoo'd and lone: Yet time with magic unconfess'd Has moulded feelings in thy breast, Which now like buried music float With soft and secret under-note; So delicate, they scarce appear To haunt thy spirit's maiden sphere, But waken'd once,—and they shall be A soul within a soul to thee! Emotions, of themselves afraid, A temple in thy heart have made, Wherein they flutter, like a bird That trembles when a voice is heard! And fancy loves a Being now Whom shaping words cannot avow; A Form of fine imaginings To which attracted nature clings. At length he comes! that nameless one The eye of Dreams had gazed upon; The magic and the mystery Of life have now begun for thee, And thou the type of heaven wilt prove In primal, deep, and deathless love! Emotion that is most sublime Of all which hallows earth and time; That Principle from whence we draw The light of each celestial law; Pervading Sense, victorious Power Whom death nor darkness can devour; An omnipresent might and spell Wherein all mind and matter dwell, Is Love!—by that bright word alone We vision forth The vast Unknown, The Ruler of the seraphim, Whose glory makes the glorious dim! And not an element that glows But breathes the life which love bestows. So magical its wide command, The sternest rock, the bleakest strand Around an exiled wretch hath thrown A charm that paradise might own! And who, when form and face depart Which seldom touch'd his deeper heart, Or e'en in hours of marring strife Disturb'd the pure serene of life, That feels not, while he says, “Farewell!” A love-born sense within him dwell? A touch of heart, whose tenderness Provokes him with a thrilling stress? And hence the captive, when the light Of freedom daunts his reeling sight, With something of a mute regret His gaze on dungeon-walls hath set, Though Misery's hand had graven there The words and weakness of despair! There is but One who cannot love, The Anarch of the thrones above; Apostate, in whose sleepless eyes A hell of burning hatred lies; Whose torture is th' undying sense Of unadored Omnipotence; A wither'd, dark, defeated Mind, That curses Heaven, and scorns mankind! And will the loveless, stern, or grave, Think human fancies wildly rave, When young affection's meteors play In dazzling falsehood round their way? Oh! take him to some towering mind Whose Orphic words entrance mankind, And, when the mask is laid aside, And backward rolls the blood-warm tide Of feelings, rich with early truth, And vital with the flush of youth, How wither'd, wan, and leafless, grows The laurel which Renown bestows, To that bright wreath affection wove Round the fair brow of youthful love! That love, whose faintest impulse wrings The bosom's agonised strings, And even in its mildest reign O'erpowers him with a yearning pain, A feeling that is unforgot, Which seems the core of life to rot And deaden it with slow decay, As water frets the rock away!— Thus passion forms the bane or bliss Of being, in a world like this; The day or night of inward joy, Which years may dim, but not destroy; Love reigns but once, yet that will be Affection's true eternity! All future love mere echo seems Of vanish'd hope's melodious dreams; A dying tone of lost delight, A fragment of those feelings bright That once when youth and heart were whole Excited, charm'd—and crush'd the soul! But, maiden! in thy vernal bloom, On thee attends a calmer doom; No clouds along thy placid heaven With heraldry of gloom are driven; No! all is open, bright, and blest: And hopes may wander unreprest, Like birds of beauty when they fly And wanton in their genial sky. And not for thee are voiceless fears, The rack of unrelieving tears, The agonies which coil and wind In secret round a wasted mind Like vipers with envenom'd tooth, To canker all the spirit's youth; Nor Circumstance, with eye averse, For thee hath framed a fearful curse! That long as life's dull waters roll, With broken heart and blighted soul Thy feelings, on the rack of fate, Shall live to mourn thy wedded state! Serene as thy soft brow appears The countenance of coming Years; Consenting parents' blended voice Hath sanction'd Love's ingenuous choice; And nought descends from dreams above More exquisite than woman's love, When passion in its virgin morn Within a soul like thine is born! Thy love by self is undefiled And foster'd like a spirit-child, Revered and watch'd with heart and eyes; To whom each thought would sacrifice, Each hour devote its deepest care, Each feeling give its fondest share; And earth, and time, and joy, and youth From hence derive their only truth. Let one deceive, and dead would lie The living world before thine eye! And thus, when withered years depart, They leave no wreck like woman's heart! The ruin of her mind remains Haunted by dim and dreary pains; And pining thoughts each chamber throng Where once arose the breath of song, Till Sadness, link'd with cold Despair, Unites to fix its dwelling there. With man's compare her feelings fine, How delicate, how half divine! Torn by the slightest breeze of life And shatter'd by each varied strife, When wrong, or wo, or accident Perturbs the spirit's element, In fragile bloom they seem to be Like leaves on some majestic tree, That often when the boughs are still Regardless of the breeze's will, Are shaken by a touch or tone, And perish, ere the blast hath blown! But thou art loved, and unbetray'd; And who can paint, enamour'd maid! The paradise where dream and rove Those moments dedicate to love? For One there is, whose eye repays The fervour of thy fondest gaze, Whose language with its melting tone Of tenderness can match thy own; Whose visions of the beautiful When most his yielded heart they rule, Are woven out of thoughts of thee Like rainbows from a lovely sea! Has the world changed, more heavenly grown, And every taint of darkness flown? That brightness is the sudden birth Of feelings which ennoble earth, Of passion in its stainless prime Just risen on the brink of time! By these transform'd, creation glows With each warm tint the mind bestows; A deeper verdure decks the grass; The clouds with richer glory pass, The winds a sweeter welcome chant, And wheresoe'er her footsteps plant Their printless beauty, smile and sound Of new enchantment hover round! To her 'tis mystery;—but the mind Grown exquisite and o'er-refined, Can veil the universe with light Till all is heaven that meets the sight, And outward nature wears the dress Of mind's internal loveliness. Commingled souls! 'twere vain to tell, Around them as rich evening fell And clouds of calmest beauty lay Like dreams of air along the way Where wan and far th' horizon wound, While nought but ocean breathed a sound, How often on the placid shore They rambled, till the light was o'er, What rapture on each radiant cheek, While softer than the billows speak Responsive to the pleading wind, The murmurs of each happy mind! The waves beneath, the skies above, All sights and sounds were born of love! So all unstain'd by earth's alloy Their very blood grew liquid joy; So full their hearts, they fain would reel, And make delight too deep to feel! Th' aroma of all mortal bliss Enrich'd an hour so charm'd as this; Till soul-enrapt, they seem'd to be Attracted nearer Deity; While each to each immortal grew, And saw the spirit beaming through A glowing face, where Love had given The features that were form'd for Heaven! All hours are sweet, when love is there A loveliness to make and share; All scenes delight, when eyes adored The magic of their gaze afford; No rock is bleak, no desert rude, When Beauty walks the solitude: But moonlight charms the outward eye Like music heard by memory; And temptingly the moonbeams play Around young lovers' lonely way, As though fond Nature glow'd to meet The pressure of their timing feet. Belated, like a starry train When loth to quit the azure plain, Yon vision'd pair, behold them now While Dian bares her crested brow, And clouds of alabaster white Float on the soundless breath of night. How beautiful Creation's sleep! So innocent, so calm, and deep: The air is rock'd to voiceless rest; The bird within his woven nest; The dew upon unshaken leaves A web of filmy lustre weaves; And onward as the lovers steal, You'd deem the fairy ground could feel Their shadows o'er its silence fall, So rapt a stillness veileth all! But they have reach'd a woodland-shore, Where billows, now the breeze is o'er, Are blended into one broad mass Of heaving glory,—like a glass Reflecting forth with twinkling change The heaven-lights, in their lofty range. Magnificent, and mute, and bright, To feel it, is to worship night! And there they stand, absorb'd and blest, In adoration unexprest; Yet drinking in with eye and soul Earth's beautiful and boundless whole. And when that tranced delight is o'er, They glide along yon glittering shore; Where tones of whisper'd feeling take The heart from each! as lips awake In words which Love design'd to be The heart's revealing masonry. A past, in its undying truth Still vocal with the vows of youth: A future, with each promise rife Of tranquil home and wedded life, Of these they talk, and plan, and scheme, Indulging hope's oracular dream: So soft the hour, the future rolls Obedient to prophetic souls By banks of bliss, and meads of flowers, As though from wishes came the hours! But night hath deepen'd: now they roam Enchanted to expecting home; And see! where downward hills retire, In dim repose the village-spire! Around it smiles a yellow moon Gilding the leafy flush of June. But home is reach'd, the room is gain'd, With many a blush the walk explain'd, Whose length 'twas not for time to meet, For what can weary lovers' feet! And smiles on each parental face Have risen with forgiving grace; And on the mother's brow is read A tale which truth might thus have said, “How often when my age was thine, Were walks as long and lonely mine!” And say, can aught but death unbind Affections round her soul entwined? Though distance may bereave the eye And o'er him hang a stranger sky, The sun that brings her spirit's day Is born of his illuming sway. The ground he trod a glory wears; The twilight-walk his step declares; No melody so sweetly heard As fancy's love-repeated word; His picture on her heart portray'd, (Soft mem'ry asks no other aid) Bright o'er her face she oft can feel His vision'd gaze of fondness steal! The breathings of his soul begin To thrill her echoing soul within; And then, ere mind is half aware, Her lips address the tongueless air In words of unregarded tone, As sunlight on a rock is thrown Where flower nor herbage, fruit nor stream, Exult to drink the offer'd beam. Against him raise a slanderous breath,— And blooming looks the cheek of Death, Compared with that appall'd distress That blights her features' loveliness! Applaud him, and the heart will rise Dissolved within her dewy eyes! Lustrous, and fill'd with tearful light Like rain-beads when the moon is bright. Voiceless her tongue, but what a glow Of spirit's grateful overflow, In eloquent excess appears To glitter through those dawning tears! And ah! forgive, if fondly weak Too soft of one her soul will speak; And faintly interweave his name With hours when love should hide its claim. For thus chance-words will oft betray How secret thoughts roam far away; And hence by soft and sudden tone The dreamings of the mind are shown, Like rays of beauty when they dart From out a cloud's divided heart, And dazzle into gay surprise The lids of unexpecting eyes. Too much of pomp and aim is seen Where'er the pen of man hath been; But, lovely one! how sweet for thee Within thy trellis'd room to be, And there to language yield thy mind As bends a flower before the wind! And, aimless save the soul to show, What magic will thy words bestow, As bright they rush with fondest speed To visit eyes which yearn to read Each syllable that love can frame, When hallow'd by so dear a name! Between its banks as roams the stream And murmurs like a liquid dream, Surrender'd to the guiding force Of nature in its beauteous course,— So artlessly is woman's mind To tones of untaught grace resign'd, And wanders down the fairy tide Of words whose sweetness love supplied! Bells on the wind! hark! peal on peal Comes wafted with melodious zeal, Making the morn so bright and clear To thrill like joy's own atmosphere! A bird-song from each holly flows; The bee hums loudly in the rose; And like a soaring dew-drop seems The butterfly to shed its gleams Of hue and lustre, in wild play Of rapture round its wingèd way.— Creation, like a human soul, Feels gladness through each fibre roll! And mark ye, where yon churchyard shows The tombs' and turfs' sepulchral rows, And sunbeams o'er the graves advance To touch them with as bright a glance As once around each living head The beauty of their joyance spread,— A crowd of village forms attends; Their lip with lip loud welcome blends; And homeward by a rose-strewn track The gay-eyed young are wending back, To drink around a festive board Such health as loving hearts afford. But whence the joy?—behold yon room, And there in hymeneal bloom Array'd like clouds of fleecy mould When round the moon their grace is roll'd, And bending like a human flower, With beauty for her matchless dower,— The bride, the daughter, and the queen Whose virtues crown our vision'd scene! Poet and painter, each may bring, Fresh from the spirit's fountain-spring Full many a truth and many a tone Which Nature shall confess her own. But there, in yon bright room are met Feelings which ne'er were mirror'd yet, Save by the features when they start To life from out the living heart!— The old, the tried, whose years retain The light of early friendship's reign, From childhood holding firm and deep The faith unworldly bosoms keep; A sire, upon whose honour'd head A silvery grace of time is spread, Beholding like a priest of joy The smiles which every face employ, (Though mellow'd is the meeker smile That slumbers on his own the while) Again unite:—and she is there, Whose heart becomes one voiceless prayer, That life may round a daughter pour Exhaustless mercy's heavenly store! And thou! 'mid all the bridal star, Thy bosom is one tender war 'Tween fond regret for faded hours, And love whose fulness overpowers! Deep tears within thy heart arise Though scarcely yet they dim thine eyes, Lest shades of grief should haply fall Upon thy wedding-carnival, And eyes parental catch from thee A tear thy soul would shake to see! But when the sad adieus are sigh'd Thy spirit to its core is tried, As garden, ground, and village-mead From the wing'd chariot fast recede: One look! so long it seems to cling Around the spot of Life's dead spring! One rapid glance at paths of yore, Where roam'd the Days which breathe no more! And nature, wrung beyond control, In tears will then express thy soul! And let them fall! for tears like thine Might hang on eyelids half divine; And love in their excess can see How soft a woman's soul can be. And she is gone! the wedded maid Whose loveliness a home array'd With lustre caught from every gaze, Her look, her laugh, her winning ways, How are they felt as unforgot In each young scene and household-spot! Dismal the once glad room appears; And eyes are charged with coming tears, When haply to their pensive sight Some little gift is brought to light, Some token of departed hours For memory left, like waning flowers! The fairy harp her fingers loved In tomb-like calm stands unremoved; And o'er her pictured face is sigh'd A deeper thought than words supplied, When silent, sad, unwatch'd, and lone, A mother lets her grief be shown! Yon garden, too, now reft and lorn, Methinks its alter'd features mourn, So droopingly the flowerets bend, So dyingly their leaves depend, To what they were, when dew-bright Dawn Beheld her on the breathing lawn The goddess of the matin hour, Arraying each expectant flower With life and beauty; while the bird Sang in the laurel-boughs unstirr'd, And each coy breeze which caught her hair Enamour'd hung, and nestled there! Her sister, she whose tiny feet Were wing'd when one was there to meet, Now prattles in her dream and walk, As though the lisping mind could talk Of nothing, save that dearest one Her bosom yearns to rest upon! And many a Home her hand relieved For one so pure hath pined and grieved; Whose presence to the cottage grew Like heaven before a martyr's view,— So bright the change her blessing made When sorrow had the soul betray'd. But what remains for Minstrel-art? Aught further can his page impart Of feelings whose domestic sway Conducts the hours of life away? Then picture for thy pensive mood A tranquil home in solitude; And there, behold! the maid we drew In Nature's soft but sterling hue. Those budding traits, when girlhood smiled, Of heart and mind, which all beguiled, Expanded now to full-blown grace, Have alter'd not with time and place: Each added year has hail'd the birth Of some new charm and noble worth; And, save that on her brow appears A mellow tinge of matron years, And in her eye serenely glows The magic of the mind's repose, A girl in spirit still is left Without one ray of youth bereft. She is a mother! what a bliss Celestial fills a name like this With meaning, whose concentred might Is mock'd by that mean word—delight! For sooner may cold earth describe The glories of th' angelic tribe, Than any save a mother tell What mysteries in her being dwell. How spirit-fill'd her loving face! How beautiful! thereon to trace The imagery of rising thought By feeling's hidden sculpture wrought! When infant-voices round her roll Like echoes of maternal soul; And words like shatter'd music rise Faint on her ear, in fond replies From lips that quiver lisp and play Like blossoms on a breezy day. But, ah! should malady destroy Each fairy bud of infant joy, And broken cries but half reveal The buried pangs dark moments feel, What wrung Despair in tragic stone, What Misery in marble shown, In eloquence of grief can vie With all that speaks her loving eye!— When bending o'er a tortured child By fits 'tis fervent, sad, or wild, And prompt, if pain might thus be quell'd, To drink the anguish she beheld Into her soul, with one deep gaze, And bear it with immortal praise! Home of my fancy, fare thee well! Unbroken be thy guardian spell; Though not unmarr'd may be thy fate, Since darkness girds our brightest state, And Life along each path of hours With thorns hath intertwined the flowers: Yet hearts where home and love unite Share more than bleakest years can blight; The sky may frown, the tempest fall, But Woman can o'ercome them all, While calm within affection's eyes Endures that beaming paradise, Where sorrow seeks a bright repose And basks beyond the reach of woes. Land of my soul! maternal Isle Array'd by Freedom's holy smile; Whose throne is founded on the cause Of native worth and noble laws; Oh, long may Private Life be found The glory of our British ground, And Woman on her stainless brow Wear the bright soul we honour now! For though thy fleets o'erawed the main Till every billow felt thy reign; And captive Empires drew the car Of victory from triumphant war, Thy strength is canker'd, if the core Of private life be sound no more. Consumption on the cheek can bloom, When Beauty but declares a tomb; And eyes their brightest meaning shed While every ray foretells the dead; And thus may fatal glory be An Empire's garb of infamy, If once that spring of manly pride, True gallantry, be stain'd or dried: Or Woman from her high domain Must dwindle into meaner reign. The touching grace, the tender glow Of what our fondest moods bestow; The hopes which keep the heart awake And self from out the selfish take; The softness and the spell of all That bridal dreams elysium call, Born of her magic, blend their sway To charm the clouds of time away: And if there be a home on earth Where nature most unveils its worth And earth and heaven can intertwine, Angel of Life! that home is thine. SATAN: OR, INTELLECT WITHOUT GOD. BOOK I. “Earth's kingdoms and their glory.” Milton. Awake, ye thunders!—and with gloomy roar Deepen around me, while a darkness shrouds The air, as once again this World I greet Here on the haughty mountain, where of old The God Incarnate, in the heavens re-throned, Was tempted and withstood me. Lo! the powers Of Nature, by my dread command sublimed, Mount into rage, and magnify the storm To elemental grandeur; while as Prince By whom the spirit-peopled air is bound In bondage, from my viewless throne I gaze, Prompting the Tempest; whose convulsive swell Heaves like the echo of my spirit's war, The moral earthquake that makes hell within! Hark! to the crash of riven forest-boughs In yonder waste, the home of Hurricanes, That catch the howlings of the cavern'd brutes And waft them onwards to Arabia's wild, O'ercanopied with flying waves of sand Like a dread ocean whirling through the skies. But Thou alone, eternally sublime, Thou rolling mystery of might and power! Rocking the tempest on thy breast of waves Or, spread in breezy rapture to the sun, Thou daring Ocean! that couldst deluge worlds And yet rush on,—I hear thy deep-toned wrath In ceaseless thunder challenging the Winds Resoundingly; and from afar behold Thine armied billows, plunging in the blast, And the wild sea-foam shiver on the gales! Exult, ye waves! and, whirlwinds! sweep along Like the full breathings of almighty ire, Whose sound is desolation! Where the sail Of yon lone vessel, like a shatter'd cloud, Is moving, let the surges mount on high Their huge magnificence, and lift their heads, And like Titanic creatures tempest-born, In life and fury march upon the main! Rave on, thou Tempest! in thy fiercest roar; To me thy reckless mood is fearful joy; A faint memento of that direful scene When proud rebellion shook the walls of heaven, Till, girt with thunder, dread Messiah came, And hurl'd us downward to the deep of hell. The Tempest dies; the winds have tamed their ire; The sea-birds hover on enchanted wing; And save a throb of thunder, faintly heard, And ebbing knell-like o'er yon western deep Which now lies panting with a weary swell Like a worn monster at his giant length Gasping, with foam upon his troubled mane,— The sounds of elemental wrath retire. The Sun is up! look, where He proudly comes In blazing triumph wheeling o'er the earth, A victor in full glory! At his gaze The heavens as with emotion smile, and beam With many a sailing cloud-isle sprinkled o'er; While forest-woodlands and enliven'd flowers The central monarch of the skies salute. Now hills are gleaming; rich the mountains glow; The streams run gladness, yellow meads appear, And palm-woods glitter on Judæan plains; Beauty and brightness shed their soul abroad:— Then let me, whom no mortal space can bound, The Earth survey, and mark her mighty realms. Why, what a stately Orb is this! how wide In range! how wonderful in scene! the grace And crown—the paragon of worlds! And Thou, for whom all elements exist, A second nature from thy soul hath sprung, And made wide earth a new creation seem! Deserted isles, with oceanic wastes, Heaving and wild, monotonous and vast; Terrific mountains, where the fire-floods dwell, Or snows in iced eternity congeal; And haggard rocks uplifted, huge, or bare, The hoary frame-work of a ruin'd world: And rivers deep, exulting as they glide, And forests high, and dales by woods o'erhung, With meadows greenly bright, and champaigns broad; And flowers, whose beauty blush'd in Paradise, By streams that murmur of their mountain-birth; With high-domed cities, crown'd with misty clouds, And shadow'd interchange of hamlets lone Which deck the verdure of retreating vales,— Before me, like a panorama, spread; Far as the ice-clad North hath bared its brow, To where the burning South extends, from East To West this theatre of man I view. Jerusalem, forlorn Judæan Queen! Girt with the grandeur of prophetic hills, How art thou fallen from thy sacred height Of splendour and renown! Unhallow'd now, Save by the tombs and memory of the past; Hush'd are thy Trumpets, which enrapt the air With Jubilee, when Freedom burst the chain Of captives, heart with heart embraced, and eye To eye beam'd fellowship; while not an ear But feasted on that soul-awakening sound! Thy Temple vast, whose architect was God Himself, when first the giant fabric grew, That matchless Pile! on which Religion gazed With haughty glance, where Glory dwelt enshrined;— Where is it now? Dead as the Roman dust, That erst, with living valour fired, uncrown'd Thy queenly pride, and palsied thy vast walls, Strewing the plains with atoms of thy strength. And yet, where yonder marbled courts, and mosques With sun-gilt minarets, like glitt'ring peaks Of mountain-tops, are seen, a Prophet stood, And in stern vision saw predestined Time Advancing, with dark ruin on his wings, To shatter thee, and sprinkle the wide earth With orphans of thy race. How scornful rang Thy laughter, when such vision was unroll'd! But when thy rocks were echoed with the cry Of Desolation, moaning her despair, Many a Demon on the viewless winds Exulted, shouting, with revengeful joy, “Thus sink the glories of great Palestine!” Alas, for human Grandeur! in the pomp Of Temples, and the stony Wonders, rear'd In rebel majesty against the might Of ages, let Ambition learn her doom. Bagdad, o'er famed Chaldea proudly raised In tow'ring splendour by the Tigris' banks; And hoary Smyrna of Mæonic fame, All beautiful in ruins, where the fruits And flowers yet flourish o'er deserted Art And laughing streamlets run with liquid joy; With Tyre and Sidon, where rich Commerce ruled Showering her treasures o'er the sunny East; And gay Damascus, whose delicious plains Of verdure, striped with water's radiant flow, Shine green as ever,—in your wrinkled piles Are lessons for the loftiest eyes to read, That mark ye now, and dream of vanish'd might When merchants rivall'd Kings! But far o'er all, Where yonder mountain mingles with the plain Of billowy sand, gigantic, dread, and lone, Great Heliopolis in ruin mourns. And next, yon ancient desert-Queen behold, The blasted Genius of the wilderness, Palmyra! pillar'd yet in temple-pride, Decayless arches show past glory still; But wither'd down from her Zenobian pomp When there the sun-idolatries were seen And Grandeur call'd the streets her own,—but now, Let Solomon arise, and read her fate! But, sadder yet, beyond the Libyan wild Sepulchral Egypt lies! Come royal heirs Of Ptolemy, and patriarchal kings, And see the shadow of your once sublime And storied Egypt! True, her fostering Nile, That flowing wand'rer of mysterious birth, Her annual life-flood generously yields; But where the soul of Science? where the fount Of Wisdom, from whose deep and dateless spring The Greek and Roman drank? Colossal Thebes, How grimly sleep thy ruins! where of yore, Like billows trooping at the whirlwind's call Forth from thy hundred gates the battle-cars Out-roll'd! Thy tombs and arches, Temples huge As sculptured mountains, darkling yet remain, But sadness broods o'er all. And ye august, In blighted majesty of stone uprear'd, Stern Pyramids! which point your heads to heaven As pillars that could prop the spheres, a day Is coming when ye moulder into dust, And melt like dew-dops by the wind annull'd! So sink the monuments of ancient might, So fade the gauds and splendours of the World. Her empires brighten, blaze, and pass away, And trophied Fanes, and adamantine Walls Which challenged an eternity, depart Amid the dying change, or lapse of things: Enthroned o'er all, bleak Desolation frowns, Save mind—omnipotent, surpassing Mind! One scintillation of the soul inspired Though kindled in an atmosphere of gloom Or loneliness, will strengthen, glow, and live, And burn from age to age, till it become The sun and glory of a thinking world When thrones are shatter'd, and their kings forgot! The revolution and the wrath of Time, Rolling his years with an avenging flow Alike o'er all, hath been a thread-worn theme Which tunes the sentiment of many an Age. And thus, the musing lover of the past, Romancing idly o'er the name of time, Untombing empires, and re-crowning kings, In sighing wonder ends his moral strain! Thou fool! and martyr to a feeble word; 'Tis Thought and Action, those unslumb'ring two, Which give to time solemnity and dread; And he who marks mere havoc, not the war Of passion, and inclining will, but prates And lulls his moral in a dream of words. Let him who muses on the awful wreck Of Empires, wailing in the dust, and thrones Reversed, or cities in their ruin vast, Here History and her inspirations dwell, Dive deeper, till he stretch a thought to Me! Ere man was fashion'd from his fellow dust, I was!—and since the sound of human voice First trembled on the air, my darksome power Hath compass'd him in mystery, and in might; Upon the soul of sage Philosophy And Wisdom, templed in the shrines of old, Faint shadows of my Being fell; a sense Of me thus deepen'd through the onward flood Of ages, till substantial thought it grew, A certainty sublime, in that great soul, The epic-god of ancient song, who down The infinite abyss could dare to gaze, And summon forth the imagery of Hell. And in that Book, where heaven lies half reveal'd, By words terrific as the herald-flash That hints the lightning-vengeance of a storm, Am I not vision'd? as the Prince of Air, A Spirit that would crush the universe, And battle with Infinity? Yet Truth, So unrelenting in her solemn task, A chilling welcome in the eyes of men Hath found, denying what they dread to feel. Kind Infidel! satanic praise accept; Friend of the guilty, solace of the vile, And teacher of the vain, mankind instruct And make one world, my own. Oh, few believe When condemnation awes the spirit back! Save hearts, where all simplicities of faith Abound, and warn each hell-born doubt away Or men, self-tortured, who at midnight dream Of oceans foaming with eternal fires, Or ghastly air-fiends, writhing as they howl,— Save unto these, and souls of kindred hue, The Powers of Darkness are a cheat of words, Framed by a Priest to juggle fools. Alas! Yet oft they frown upon the mocker's path And feel they could, did Nature not prevail, Burst into life, and blast him with a gaze! `What understanding cannot grasp, belief Can never claim,”—a wisdom most divine! Why, all around him, from the race of flowers That woo his unadmiring gaze, to hosts Of orbèd wonders which the sky pervade, Is Mystery, robed in some material pomp; Then why should mysteries of awe within, Themselves resolve to charm a sceptic mind? Religion acts, but unexplain'd abides;— The beatings of the heart resemble this, And men may wonder, but it still beats on! But when the balance of sublunar Things Is tried, amended, and for ever fix'd, Belief for unbelief shall then atone By sad conviction:—then shall it be proved, The Sin that violated and deform'd This World, and all true harmonies profaned, (In dread similitude to mind o'erthrown) Hath been the evil which my power hath fed, By dark communion with this mortal Scene. No! not a havoc Nature's kingdom feels; No sound of Ocean when her wings rise plumed With wrath; no frenzy of the tragic winds, Those viewless pirates whom the pathless seas Endure,—no terror in the darkest reign Of Elements that lord it so sublime, But images that dreadful curse I reap'd For Nature and for Man! And ye, dead Climes! Where high of old my bloody Altars blazed, Where oracles from cave or temple breathed, And Monsters, vision'd out of monstrous thought, With stock and stone idolatries, were bred, My hand was on ye, and your heathen soul! And now, Ambition trampling out the heart Of earth; the demi-gods of false renown; And all the giants of heroic crime, Are demons of my will; and by their doom Shall testify the Genius whence they spring! Might vanish'd ages be renew'd, and built Again those daring Empires once renown'd, From that huge one the haughty Ninus rear'd And great Cambyses crush'd, to Rome and Greece Of commonwealths the glory,—what a scene Would time reveal! Who bow'd them into gloom? They fear'd me not; but from the primal stone Which mark'd the birthday of their city-queens I mingled with them, and beheld them rise: From dim obscurity my minions watch'd Their growth to greatness, and imperial sway, That over-shadow'd the far Isles. The Sea Beneath them, like a suppliant crouch'd; the Winds Sang victory! where exulting banners waved; But now, uplifted to a fearful height, They courted vilely-enervating Arts, Unthroned the Virtues, let the Passions loose, And pour'd corruption through their rank domain: Then came the Nemesis!—that moral Curse Whose ruin more than desolation brings. But see, where Persia's beauteous clime extends, How gloriously diluvian Ararat Hath pinnacled his rocky peak in clouds! Who thrones a winter on his heights untrod, While summer laughs in roses at his feet! Time cannot mar his glory: high he swells As when that Ark was balanced on his brow, Which saw the raging of the far-off floods Beneath, and heard the Deluge die away! But here, as in her day of olden might, Ascendant Nature proves the God of souls Who deify mere elements, and dream Them symbols of their Maker. On the peak Of mountains, the Chaldean hail'd the Sun In the rich brightness of its morning-birth, And bow'd his forehead to the flaming East; The Night, ennobled with her stars, pour'd love And worship into hearts, that from the fields Beheld their throbbing radiance, as the face Of Prophets, bright with their intelligence:— And still upon the Gueber's fateful eye The Fire darts gleaming magic; and his mind Through nature darkly struggles on to God. A mightier scene upon the map of earth!— Forests immense, and pine-wastes fiercely wild, And ice-rocks, rear'd upon a dead-white sea, Far to the north where hoary deserts gleam Dawn on my view in all their Arctic gloom. But not Siberia, desolate and grand, Nor Dneiper, thunder'd on by cataracts That whiten o'er her howling waves, appear So wondrous, as those battle-hosts that rush Like rivers swelling from their deep abodes, Precipitately o'er the regions round. A King hath spoken! and the trump of War Hath sounded like a herald through the land, “Awake! great Peter is alive again.” A word of Kings, what potency it wields! These delegates of God, yea, gods themselves, Upon whose lips the fate of Empire hangs, Tremendous is their charge: one speaks, and lo! Up springs infernal War, and stalks abroad, Unrolls his blood-red banner on the wind, And in the groan of widow'd Nations hails The music of his fame! Another speaks, And Peace, with olive in her radiant hand, Glides like an angel through the world, and prints A trace of blessing wheresoe'er she treads. And who could ponder on this war-doom'd scene, Nor dream thy shadow swelling into life, Napoleon! On the island-rock thou sleep'st; But such a storm thy spirit raised, so full The swell of feeling born of thee, that Time Must lend his magic to allay the strife And tempest of opinion into truth, Which, taming wonder, stamps thee, as thou wert, A tyrant! in whose passion for a power, Above all liberty and law enthroned, I hail, thee as a Paramount; thy pride Of domination tow'ring far o'er heights Of monarchy,—a shadow of mine own, Which scorn'd an equal though He proved a God! And therefore did I crown thee, Kingly One! And those who worship thee, my thanks inspire! Mean crimes are branded with avenging scorn, While great ones, that should water earth with tears, Can dazzle condemnation into praise, And praise to pity, when false greatness fails! The throneless, in the heart a throne acquires, And Admiration in one sigh can drown The wail of millions, haunting each red field Of havoc, where some Desolator trod! The wish is hated, but the deed caress'd, Of mad Ambition; “glory” heals all wounds! Yet, what a cloud on Liberty was thrown! How deep a gash her dreadless form profaned, When thine ambition march'd upon the world, Till Europe quail'd beneath thy scepter'd arm! Then, crumbled hopes which centuries will not build Again; then god-like spirits felt a pang That now, when canonading battles pause, And Peace sits musing on the tomb of War, Is felt,—an agony too deep for words To fathom, too sublime for slaves to feel! Lo! where the Tyrant felt a flood of wrath From Heaven pour'd down upon his guilty head, And first he knew himself a Man!—Yon spires With golden pinnacles that pierce the clouds, And river, winding by those pallid walls, Proclaim where unforgotten Moscow stands: There raged a scene which ruin'd angels love To witness, when the vaunting sons of Clay Grow demon-like, and shudd'ring Time beholds The fellest misery Despair can feel! As when, all wildly through the unbarr'd gates Like savage war-fiends his marauders swept, And saw the city billow'd into flames, Like some far ocean blazing through the storm! Then Havoc started with a thrilling shout; The shriek of violated maids, the curse Of dying mothers, and despairing sires, And dash of corpses, torn from royal tombs And plunged amid devouring flames, were heard Till hell in miniature wild Moscow seem'd. But who, when Rapine could not pillage more, While cannon-thunder chased the daunted winds, Paused on a desert-heath, in speechless ire, And mark'd the remnant of a ruin'd host Flying, and pale as phantoms of Despair? Napoleon! in the earthquake of thy soul, The elements were reaping vengeance then! While slaughter turn'd the tide of victory And roll'd it back upon thy powerless host Of famish'd warriors, freezing as they died! That hour of agony, the crushing sense Of danger and defeat, the broken spell Which blasted all thy triumphs into shame, Sublimed thy spirit with so proud a pang It long'd to swell into a million souls, And shake the universe to save a throne! Thy race is o'er: and in the rocky isle Of ocean, canopied with willow-shade, In death's undreaming calm thou restest now. But all the splendid infamy of War, The fame of blood and bravery, is thine: Thy name hath havoc in its sound! and Time Shall read it when his ages roll:—'twill live When time and nature are forgotten words! For, as a noble fame can never die But proudly soareth on from earth to heaven, There to be hymn'd by Angels, and to crown With bright pre-eminence the gifted mind That won it gloriously; so evil fame A fiery torment to the soul shall be For ever:—let Ambition think of this! Who murders kings, to make her heroes, gods. In contrast wilder than the rude-faced globe, Appear the workings of immortal mind. Russia, through each great limb of empire, feels Proud animation play; a panting wish For high dominion, and sublimer rule Than Nature's rugged vastness yields. But Thou,— Of immemorial birth, whose massy wall Of ages, with her thousand war-towers flank'd, Majestic winds o'er many a savage hill And mountain, China! thou art motionless, Or like the Dead Sea, sullenly reposed Amid the surging restlessness of Time. Those burden'd waters, whereon breed and die Thy generations; fancy-mountains, graced With temples; or pagodas gaily deck'd, And artful wonders, by the hand or tongue Completed,—such are glories form'd for thine Ascendancy! Thus bulwark'd in with pride And baseness, virtues, arts, and vices act From year to year, unchallenged and unchanged. Antiquity, the childhood of the world, Broods like a torpid vapour o'er thy clime, And dulls its vigour into drowsy calm; So let it sleep! till Revolution wake, And summon spirits who shall cry,—Reform! Lo! in the East, enormously uprear'd, What ice-peak'd mountains point their roseate heads Amid the richness of an Indian sky, Soundless and solemn as cathedral-towers Made dim and spectral by the wintry moon! Hills of the North! not all your Greenland-pomp Can more sublimely scale the clouds. And where Bright Ganga! mountain-born, careers the flood That matches thee? The vassal rivers mix Their spirit with thine own; the rock-hewn caves Shake as they hear thee sounding through their depths, Then, upward springing with a glorious swell And brightness on thy waves, to course green plain And valley, like a charger in his pride Let loose to lord it o'er surrounding meads! Monarch of rivers! thy redeeming flow Is life and beauty to the sun-brown lands That border thy rich banks; but on thy stream How Superstition glasses her dull creed! Religion!—why, the undiscerning brute Hath more divinity than vaunting slaves Who, spirit-darken'd, oft blaspheme Her name: For sun and shower by him are not unthank'd. He bathes his forehead in the fresh'ning gale, And, by enjoyment, pays the gift of life. But how is reason carnalised and crush'd When hell-rites are religion!—while it chants Of mercy in the ways of heaven revealed Can offer female holocausts to Hell In burning widows, gasping forth their souls, Or drowning babes, for sacrifice to God! Oh, Wisdom! never thou the heart redeem, Nor cast the cloud from Superstition's eye! Another gaze, bright Hindostanic clime! How beautifully wild, with horn-wreath'd heads, Thy antelopes abound; and, thick as clouds Paving the pathway of the western heav'n, On wings enamell'd with a radiant dye Thy birds expand their plumage to the breeze, And glitter through air! Primeval woods, And patriarchal trees, and forest-haunts, And deserts spotted with their verdant isles, And fruits, with showers of sunbeams on their heads, Grow mingled there in magical excess; The grand and beautiful, their glowing spell Combine; Creation makes one mighty charm. But let it pass: again the voice of waves! Faint as the rush of rapid spirit-wings; An Ocean, dreadful to the gazing eye As dark eternity to human thought,— Atlantic! where the whirlwinds are the scoff Of billows, rocking with eternal roar, Thou art a wonder e'en to me, whose eyes Have fathom'd Chaos! Thou astounding Main! Time never felt so awful since his birth, Angels and demons o'er thy terrors hung, As when by hope prophetically wise, On thine immensity Columbus launch'd. Yet thou wert well avenged! for Storm and Doubt, Despair and Madness on the billows rode, And made deep Ocean one dark agony!— Dismal as thunder-clouds, the fated hours Toil'd on; a living solitude still howl'd And heaved, in dread monotony around; Yet hope was quenchless; and when daylight closed, The ocean-wanderers, in the placid glow Of sunset, soothing their despondent brows, Hymn'd o'er the mellow wave their vesper-song; Ave Maria! mingling with the choirs Of billows, and the chant of evening-winds. But he was destined! and his lightning-glance Shot o'er the deep, and darted on thy world America!—Then, lofty, long, and loud From swelling hearts the hallelujahs rang, And charm'd to music the Atlantic gales; While, silent as the Sun above him throned, Columbus look'd a rapture to the heavens And gave his glory to the God they serve! Thou fated Region of the varied globe Where all the climates dwell, and Seasons rule In majesty, hereafter when the tides Of Circumstance have roll'd through changing years, What Empires may be born of Thee!—thy ships By thousands, voyaging the isle-strewn deep; Thy banners waved in every land! E'en now Defiance flashes from thy fearless eye, While Nature tells thee greatness is thine own.— Who on those dreadful giants of the South, Those Pyramids by man's Creator rear'd, Thine Andes, girdled with the storms, can gaze; Or hear Niagara's unearthly flood Rival the thunder with impassion'd roar, Nor think the spirit of ambition rules Thy moral nature. What a grandeur lives Through each stern scene!—in yon Canadian woods, Whose stately poplars clothe their heads with clouds, And dignify creation as they stand; Or in the rain-floods,—rivers where they fall! Or hurricanes, which howl themselves along, Like fierce-wing'd monsters, ravenously wild:— Sublimity o'er all a soul hath breathed, And yet my ban is on thee!—'tis the curse Of havoc, which the violators reap'd For thy young destiny, when first amid Thy wilds the cannon pour'd its thund'ring awe, Shaking the trees which never yet had bow'd, Save to the storminess of nature's ire. Hath Gentleness thy guilt of old redeem'd? Hath freedom heal'd the wounds of war, and paid Her ransom to the nameless and unknown, The unremember'd, but immortal still, The Dead, whose birthright was sublime as kings'? Approach, and answer me, dejected One! Art thou the remnant of a free-born race, Majestic lords of nature's majesty? Of them, whose brows were bold as heaven, whose hands Have tamed the woods, whose feet outfled the winds, Who faced the lightning with undazzled gaze And dream'd the thunder language of their god: The earth and sky, 'twas Freedom's and their own! But thou—the Sun hath written on thee, Slave! A branded limb and a degraded mind The tyrants give thee for infernal toil And tears; or lash thy labour out in blood. And some are Saxons, who enslave the free; Then boast not, England! while a Briton links The chain of thraldom, glory can be thine. Vain are thy vows, thy temples, and the rites Which hallow them, while yet a slave exists Who curses thee: each curse in Heaven is heard; 'Tis seal'd, and answer'd in the depths Below! From dungeon and from den there comes a voice That supplicates for Freedom: from the tomb Of martyrs her transcendency is told, And dimm'd she may, but cannot be destroy'd. Who bends the spirit from its high domain On God himself a sacrilege commits; For soul doth share in His supremacy; To crush it, is to violate the power And grasp the sceptre an Almighty wields! For freedom, such as proud ambition call'd A freedom, a Heaven I lost; and therefore slaves On earth are victims whom I scorn to see. No! let them in their liberty be mine; Or, what if foul Oppression fill the cup Of crime, that Hell may have a deeper draught? My kingdom is of evil; and the crowns Of many an earth-born Despot sparkle there!— Then let the pangless hearts of Tyrants beat Unblasted, till from deepest agony With the proud wrath of ages in Her soul Freedom arise, and vindicate her name! BOOK II. “Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts, Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs, Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes Above the height of mountain interposed.” Paradise Regained. Sceptres are mighty wands, and few are found With strength to wield them; yet how many dare! And kingdoms are the agonies of Thrones, Yet men will die to face them! thus the Heart Exceeds itself, nor calls the madness vain. But, were it mine from kingliness to take The tyrant witchery, I'd bid some young Idolater of throne-exalted power, In the deep midnight when the World lies hush'd In her humility of sleep, to gaze Upon a prince's couch. The crimson pomp And glare of palace-chambers round him lie; But on his cheek the royal spirit stamps A weariness which mocks this outward show Of kings; a prison would have graced it more! A sad rehearsal of unhonour'd youth When years went reckless as the rolling waves, Till passion grew satiety; a proud Regret for trait'rous hearts; and that keen sense Untold, which monarchs more than subjects feel, Of slavery; (for servile is the pomp Of kings, though gorgeously it dares the eye) With a dim haunting of the dreary tomb, That often through the banquet-splendour gapes Like darkness that defies a sun!—such dream From out his slumber that calm beauty steals Which Innocence delights to wear. Then, watch His features, when some trace of dreadful thought Endows them with a spirit-eloquence, That speaks of Judgment, with its thronging host Of terrors; Monarchs cited, and the vast Account of sceptred kingdoms render'd up; Could Envy listen to his waking groan, How poor, how perilous, the state of kings! Away with this:—transcendently endow'd And in her mass of mind concent'ring more Of awfulness, than nature in its might Of rock or mountain feels, proud Europe spreads Her living map before me now! What hearts And souls commune! what countless tides of thought And feeling, in electric flow, from breast To breast, from clime to clime, prevailing here; Here is the throne of Mind; th' arena vast Where principles and passions run their course And pant and struggle with conflicting play,— Where men and angels, heav'n and hell are met, And Life flings shadows o'er eternity! Region of wonders! who yon scenes can trace, Or on thy many-featured visage mark Each motion of thy spirit, in the glow Of changing impulse, and creative power? There, is an ocean, darken'd by the wings Of vessels, leaping like the waves they front, While thund'ring to and fro their country's wrath They tell her glory to the list'ning skies! And there, a river like a liquid sweep Of light, where Commerce welcomed by the gale, Sails onward in the sun; but here, a scene Of battle, crimson'd o'er with clotting blood! Banners are playing, rich as unroll'd clouds Hung loose upon mid air; the gleam of arms Incessant flashes through the misty fray Fierce as the lightnings when they flutter wild; While mute and sad, a City waits afar With Doubt and Anguish in her desert-streets, Who catch the war-notes from the travell'd wind And answer them, with living echoes there. In dream-like contrast, 'mid the hush of noon How meekly yon romantic village lies Beneath a canopy of cloudless blue! With elm-trees twinkling as they wave, the meads Made golden for their harvest, and yon spire In peaceful beauty pointing to the heavens. Sprinkled with mountains, and with cloud-capt hills, Helvetia swells majestic on my view, In her primeval glory. Free-soul'd Land! Summer and Winter for thy smile contend, Witching thy prospects into fairy pomp With beautiful abruptness. Verdure-clad And deck'd with flowers, these undulating vales Extend, while vines the terraced hills embrace, And Landscapes, laughing o'er the clouds, may hear The Tempest-howl in cavern gloom below!— But Winter hath his triumph; let the rush And roar of cataracts; the darksome lakes,— Convulsive rolling in the midnight-storm; The glaciers, billow'd like a frozen sea Iced in the plunging madness of the storm; And, chief o'er all, the silent Alp-king rear'd Like Grandeur risen from eternity,— Let these declare thee for a land sublime. Home of the dauntless! on thy patriot-soil While sternness of simplicity can breathe A Roman vigour, and the name of Tell Haunts like a harrowing spirit every vale And mountain-hollow, Time shall honour thee, When many an Empire shall have pass'd away, And forests wave where Capitals are seen! Southward of thee, where shining rocks ascend, Pointing their cannon to the broad blue main Defyingly, what region of the sun. Is that, with green-dyed olive groves, and fruits Whose ripeness glitters on the laden boughs? 'Tis Spain! the glowing clime of Luxury, Of Chivalry, and dead Romance: her hills Where aromatic odours scent the skies, And bright-hued flowers, that in the mountain-breeze Of wafted freshness dance their beauteous heads; Her dark-eyed dames, and stately cavaliers Whose brows are haughty with the dreams of eld; Her pomp of palaces, her fountain-walks, And many-templed Capitals,—betray Her form'd for Pleasure's undisputed reign. And yet, on History's most heroic page Hath Andalusia an undying seal, And Arragon a print of fame:—but deeds Of blood, and Inquisition's torturing rack, For vengeance when the world's arraignment sounds, Will rise; and woe to Tyrants! they shall read The chronicle stern Justice keeps in hell! Here, too, the passions are despotic slaves For me; and prove how features can reveal The voiceless language of the varied mind. The languor of luxurious eyes, for Love Abounds; for Jealousy, the livid gaze Which looks a murder where its meaning falls! And for Revenge, an aspect darkly still Like savage thunder sleeping in a cloud!— And midnight is the mantle for them all. Enchanting as thou art, romantic Spain, The home of beauty and the queen of climes, Loved Italy, whose oriental heavens Are rich enough o'er Paradise to hang, Outdazzles thee in splendour. 'Tis the hour When noon-shine, dying into sunset-glow, Suffuses, like a gorgeous wing outspread In wanton glory, gleams of magic hue. How radiantly adown those heaven-bright hills The young streams tremble? Arno, mountain-born With ling'ring progress writhes along the vale: And groves and gardens on the cool wind shake Their fragrance; while around vine-laden meads Flush with their produce, and the playful breeze Ruffles the golden corn-fields. Near yon lake Mark sea-throned Venice in her island-pride, Resentful dares the Adriatic-roar! And o'er the river, where gondolas throng, 'Mid Palaces that frown with haggard Pomp Out-arches her Rialto:—she hath reign'd Her day; ducal tyrants are no more, And blighted fabrics but reveal her fame. And what is Venice to the wreck of Rome? That Giantess of empire! blacken'd, bow'd, And desolated on her seven-hill throne Behold her seated by worn Tiber's banks! Colossal ruin, like a noble mind In desolation thou art haughty still! Though Time hath conquer'd, can he equal thee? Thy Temples huge where ages are enshrined; The trophied porches, theatres august Which heard the beating of ten thousand hearts; And Fane sublime, on that Tarpeian rock, Where Vengeance grasp'd eternity!—when Rome Could trample kingdoms and o'erawe the world What grandeur rivall'd these? Their very shades Are solemn: but around them when the rush Of life was heard; when chariots, bright as clouds Which throne the morning sun, victorious came Amid the tramp of war steeds and the shout Of millions swelling with their country's fame,— Thy glory was a terror, and thine arm Omnipotence to nations! Through all realms The throbbing of thy faintest anger thrill'd, And when thou frown'dst, what kingdom dared be free? Men look on thee, as Seraphs gaze on Light, With silent rapture solemnised to awe, Till the dead Past in resurrection-pomp, Arises, and the Roman lives again! Heroes and sages start beneath their feet; Their eyes are dazzled with a starry dream Of old renown; and, like thy vassal-states, They deify thy name. And I forgive The weakness of their worship, when the sun's Bright mockery plays along thy mould'ring piles; Or when the moonbeam through some cypress-tree, Sheds rays of sorrow on thy weed-tress'd walls And gray-worn monuments; from thy young dawn Of being, ere thy roofless huts were piled, To the proud noon of greatness, thou hast proved A theme of wonder to infernal hosts, Half demons and half gods thy heroes were; And Roman teachers,—are they not still felt And follow'd? deities of mind, whose words Are wings of knowledge to the daring.—Rome Is dead; but mental Rome is reigning still With vaster sway than Pompey's eagles won! Long may it reign so! that a fiery love Of fame and battle, which defeatures earth With scars eternity shall fail to heal, May live by inspiration fierce as Rome's. Many a “hero” hath by Her been crazed; And fancied “Cæsars” yet will come, to chain The world, or fool it with disastrous fame! Yea, at this moment, in tyrannic hearts Ambition hath a mass of burning thought In secret treasured, like volcanic ire: Kindle it, Time! and rear thy second Rome. Few years have fleeted o'er this tomb-like haunt Of ruin, since a Spirit who appall'd The world, by giving thoughts a thunder-tone, And feeling, that terrific lightning-flash, That show'd the storm-depths of the soul within; Who pour'd himself in passion o'er mankind Making each heart to quiver with delight, Like water thrill'd by an electric sound,— Amid thy canker'd fanes and crumbling halls Mused in the deadness of the midnight-hour. It was a haggard night; when mortals dream That conscious Nature in dejection pines; As though the elements were all diseased, The moon hung rayless, and the few faint stars Gleam'd pale and glassy as the eye of death. Alone, the victim of his darkest mood, In the stern shade of ruin'd Palaces And pillar'd wrecks of desolated shrines The wanderer roam'd; and when some sickly break Of moonlight lit his features into play With all their lines of passionate excess, The haunting Genius of the spot he seem'd Lost in the workings of a wilder'd mind. He sigh'd, and mused; and then from earth to heav'n His eye was raised, but moisten'd with a tear Of tenderness, wherein the pride of years Had melted out from his rebellious soul, Most haughty in abasement:— blighted man! His nature was a whirlpool of desires, And mighty passions, perilously mix'd, That with the darkness of the demon-world Had something of the light of Heaven. He breathed The sighs that after-ages will repeat,— The selfish eloquence of tortured thought In words that glow with agony! Yet far From him that deeper sadness of the mind Which, gather'd from the gloom of mortal things In moments of mysterious sway, o'erclouds A soul, yet sanctifies those thoughts which feel Eternity a spirit's home to be, And time mere exile, which the man endures. So worshipp'd, and so sad!—Oh, were not hopes Destroy'd, the moral landscape Devils love To witness, idols of this world might win My pity for their portion. How deceived And how deceiving, is the race they run! The King and Hero, Bard and Sage, with all Who in the storehouse of departed time Have heap'd such treasure, as great deeds and words Beget, what bright delusions have they been! To fancied Edens of poetic bloom On wings of sentiment can Genius roam, And meditate on worldless Things, whence comes A glorious panting for a purer State, Than Adam saw, when Earth's anointed Priest In purity, his life was incense breath'd to God. But, martyrs to unhealthy thought abound, Who out of earthly elements have sought A happiness to reap whose soil is heaven, And, failing, sunk to profitless despair. Thus Learning, Luxury, and laurell'd Fame, Vain phantoms, what a worship have they won! The first, a shallow excellence; the next, A malady of brutish growth, debased And most debasing, turning soul to sense Till nature seems unspirited; the last, Magnificent betrayer! while afar Beheld, the crown of heaven itself seems thine; But when attain'd, how oft a brilliant Lie Whose lustre was but hollowness conceal'd! Oh! many an eye that in the glow of youth Hath brighten'd, as it gazed on pictured worth, Or linger'd round those everlasting shrines Where tombs have tongues, and monuments are speech, Where great inheritors of Glory rest,— Hath wept the laurels that it once adored! The atmosphere which circleth gifted minds Is from a deep intensity derived,— An element of thought, where feelings shape Themselves to fancies,—an electric world Too exquisitely framed for common life, Which they of coarser metal cannot dream. And hence, those fascinating powers of soul That robe the heavens with beauty, and create Romance which makes reality untrue, Upon the rack of quick excitement live; Their joy the essence of an agony, And that, the throbbing of the fires within! And thus, while Fame's heart-echoing clarions ring, The voice and visions of ideal renown In one vile whisper may be overwhelm'd. Made mighty by its littleness, a word Of Envy drowns the thunder which delight Hath voiced! so oft the phantom of a cloud In single darkness cowering on the air, Looks fiercer for the frownless heaven around! So Fame is murder'd, that the dull may live; Or, to Herself grows false; then hideous dreams And tomb-like shadows thicken round the mind, Till, plunging into dread infinity, It rides upon the billows which Despair Hath summon'd from the stormy gloom of thought. Dark victim! thus so ruinously famed, What misery haunts thy smile of happiness! Beneath the mountain of thy vast renown There lives a mortal, unendow'd by aught That Learning, Luxury, or Fame can yield, And yet a Crœsus in his store of joy With thine compared; the man whom sullied earth Enslaves not, on whose soul the Truth hath smiled— Truth which I loathe, but Hell cannot destroy! A model first, and then the captive made Of desolating Rome, the classic Isles Of ancient Greece, beside yon full-waved sea Laugh in the bright unbreathing air of noon. Antiquity reigns here; see! on her throne Of Athos, whence the giant-shadow sweeps, As new alighted from a cloud she stands, Waving her wand triumphant o'er her scenes;— To hoar Parnassus, where the fabled spring Of Castaly still flows; and time-awed wilds, And mountain-pass, and Marathonian plain, To every haunt heroic feet have trod Her wand is pointed,—till the Past untombs Her treasure; Athens is revived again; The slave-isles hurl their shackles o'er the sea, And Greece awakes to glorify the world! Surpassing Clime! though man thy charms profane, Nature bedecks thee with a bridal robe. When moon-tints tremble on the Adrian-waves, What sea so beautiful! what sun so bright, So ravishingly deck'd with golden beams As thine unequall'd orb!—And still yon skies Are canopies of crystal; rich-leaf'd flowers Ope radiant as the fairy wings of birds, And fruit and tree wave luscious in the wind. Again, thou upstart World, thy doom behold! Where Valour with the sword of freedom fell'd Her myriads down, like grass before the scythe; Where Art and Science in perfection reign'd, And Sculpture miracles of grace achieved; Where Eloquence her spirit volley'd forth In words that palsied Empires with their sound, As shakes a forest in the deep-toned storm! Where Poetry, by stirring passion bred, From Feeling's heart responsive numbers drew, While heavenly Wisdom to the soaring eye Of sages half reveal'd her perfect form,— There in that Land, surpassingly endow'd With all that beauty wealth and art bestow, Corruption in her darkest spirit dwells. Then learn, Adorers of Athenian gods, Learn, at the tomb of Glory laid in dust, How human passions wither while they sway; The Curse is living!—think of my revenge! Northward of Greece, behold illustrious Gaul, Britannia's rival, gaily doth outspread Her scenery, and blooming flush of life. She, too, hath beauty; and her sun-warm hills, Which bare their bosoms to the mellowing sky, With vine and fruitage, bountifully glow; While rivers of romance, by wood and vale, And bord'ring town, their sparkling waters lead. Young, fresh, and gay, elastic as the breeze, All spring and sunshine, her full spirit bounds; Here vanity is virtue: out of hearts Which seem to echo but what woman loves A waking valour, prompt to dare, and proud To die. And yet, true nobleness of mind Is faintly seen; sincerity, too harsh To please, is polish'd into courtly lies,— The frothy incense of a faithless soul. Once France and Freedom were a mingled name; And now, when all their wrathful clouds are roll'd Away, the shadows which they cast endure, Clothing the soul of memory with fear. Her Revolution, who that saw forgets, Or who that felt, and does not feel?—The storm Which makes a midnight of affrighted day, Is weak, to that rebellion of despair When buried passions, like an earthquake burst From out an injured Nation's heart. And such Was thine, afflicted France! the far-off Thrones Of tyrants stagger'd, distant Empires quail'd When, like th' embodied spirit of thy wrongs, Dread Revolution darken'd on the world, Ringing a peal that echoed Europe round And died in thunder o'er th' Atlantic deep! But thou wert too unholy to be free, Too grasping to be great; and when thy thirst For havoc brutalised the scene of blood, As though re-action for all human wrong Were centred in it for one dire revenge, A madness fired thee; and thy human fiends Rivall'd their lord in blasphemy and blood! Bounding with gladness, by yon castled banks Roll the green waters of the glorious Rhine In fullness and in freedom, swelling on For ever. There, amid some minds which hold Each hallow'd creed by dreading Hell abhorr'd, While Men to “Ego” germanise their God Dark Speculation does my brain-work well In many a school, where reeling heads grow wild And godless! Hence, all moral basis fails Wherein the judgment can alone repose Secure and solid; while the eye of faith Is darken'd, sacred conscience half extinct, And doubts, refracting heaven's unbroken light From Scripture, make the Man himself untrue,— In reasoning pride irrationally lost! Free though they look, my slaves all sceptics are; Through mental fogs, or pantheistic gloom, Blindly they grope their miserable way And make confusion more confounded still: Then, all is chaos, and the Spirit mine!— Love, Faith and Law, a trinity of powers Which shape the will, or sanctify the heart For heaven, my human miniatures disdain: Not grace for discipline, but truth for thought Proud worshippers of Indecision love Like mental antichrists: till God becomes Impersonal, a Problem for the soul To scan—mere Principle, and nothing more! Hence, German thought a German Christ evokes From misty depths, to speculation dear Because unfathom'd. Now, my reign begins: Let darkness be, where Deity said, light! Till creedless mind call God an inward Myth Of man's creation; and thus will sceptics prove The incarnations of that Lie first-born In Eden utter'd, when I whisper'd,—doubt, Renounce Jehovah and thyself believe! Fronting the wave-environ'd shore of France, And bulwark'd with her everlasting main O'er which the guardian-cliffs sublimely lower, Like palaces of stern defence, behold The Isle-queen!—every billow sounds her fame! The Ocean is her proud triumphal car Whereon she rideth; and the rolling waves The vassals which secure her victory; Alone, and matchless in her sceptred might She dares the world. The spirit of the brave Burns in her; laws are liberty; and kings Wear crowns which glitter with a people's love; And while the magna-charta of their rights Is guarded, royalty is kept secure; But let the cause of Liberty be wrong'd,— The throne is shaken! patriot-voices rise, And, prompt as billows by the tyrant-gale Excited, loud and haughty is their roar! Heaven-favour'd Land! where fitful climates reign, And home-life from the ever-clouded skies A bliss concenter'd more than France enjoys,— Of mountain-pomp, and poetry of hills, Though other climates boast, in thee supreme A pastoral grace and gentleness abound; Here all which quiet feeling love, or charms The sweet sobriety of tender thought, Is thine; a heaven whose beautiful, is change; Or sunshine tinged by unreposing clouds, That make bright landscapes when they blush abroad; The dingle grey, and wooded copse; with hut And hamlet, nestling in some bosky vale; And spires brown-peeping o'er the ancient elms, And steepled cities, faint and far away, With all that bird and meadow, brook and gale Impart,—commingle for romantic eyes Which catch the sentiment thy scenes inspire. But Ocean is thy glory: and methinks Some musing wanderer by the shore I see, Weaving his island-fancies.—Round him rock And cliff, whose grey trees mutter to the wind, And streams down-rushing with a torrent ire: The sky seems craggy, with her cloud-piles hung, Deep-mass'd, as though avenging thunder lay And darken'd in its dream of havoc there. Before him, Ocean, yelling in the blast, Wild as the death-wail of a drowning host: The surges,—let them each a tempest roll, Or lash their fury into living foam, Yon war-ship shall outbrave them all! her sails Resent the winds, and their remorseless beat; And when she ventures the abyss of waves, Remounts, expands her wings, and then—away! Proud as an eagle dashing through the clouds. And well, brave scion of the empress-Isle, Thy spirit mingles with the mighty scene, Hailing thy Country on her ocean-throne. But she hath dread atonements to complete, And burning tears to shed. Thy lofty dreams O England! may be humbled yet; behold! Thy curse is coming;—mark! for in thine own Great heart the darkness of rebellion breeds, And frowns of Heaven hang awful o'er thy doom! And now, the World before my view hath pass'd, With multitudinous array of pomp And power, of Kingdom, Plain, and Desert rude, Of Oceans, garnish'd with their glitt'ring isles, And the vast heaven which o'er-arches all! How crime and havoc in dread union leagued The fortunes of this fated earth have changed! The present still is echo to the past; Of both the future will an echo prove; A rise and fall,—a fall and rise—the doom Of men and empires thus gone ages tell. And what of this proud Age, whose wings unfold In bright expansion? Is she Wisdom's child? From the dark catalogue of sin and shame Is aught erased? Are passions more subdued, The virtues laurell'd, and the vices dead? The same in spirit doth the earth exist? If so, then, Time, I hail thee! and the Curse Shall multiply; new thrones and dynasties May come, but Desolation shall foredoom Their fate, though haughty be the aspect worn. And as among the myriads who have lived On earth, not many have our thrones regain'd, So from the myriads yet to be reveal'd In life and suff'rance, few shall face the heat Of trial scathless; few shall overcome The world, or win the crown apostles wear. But lo! the day declines; and to his couch The Sun is wheeling. What a world of pomp The heavens put on in homage to his power! Romance hath never hung a richer sky,— Or sea of sunshine, o'er whose yellow deep Triumphal barks of beauteous foam career, As though the clouds held festival, to hail Their god of glory to his western home. And now the earth seems mirror'd on the skies! While lakes and valleys, drown'd in dewy light, And rich delusions, dazzlingly array'd, Form, float, and die, in all their phantom-joy. At length the Sun is throned; but from his face A flush of beauty o'er creation flows, Then faints to paleness, for the Day hath sunk Beneath the waters, dash'd with ruby dyes, And Twilight in her nun-like meekness comes: The air is fragrant with the soul of flowers, The breeze comes panting like a child at play, While birds, day-worn, are couch'd in leafy rest, And calm as clouds the sunken billows sleep: The dimness of a dream o'er nature steals, Yet hallows it; a hush'd enchantment reigns; The mountains to a mass of mellowing shade Are turn'd, and stand like temples of the Night: While field and forest, fading into gloom, Depart, and rivers whisper sounds of fear; A dying pause, as if th' Almighty moved In shadow o'er His works, hath solemnised The world! But that hath ceased; the herald-stars, In timid lustre twinkling into life, Advance; and, faint as music's rising swell, The moon is rounding as she dawns. Fair orb! The sentimental child of earth will say, The sun glares like a warrior o'er his plain Of morning sky; but thou, so wan and meek, Appear'st a maiden of romance, who walks In placid sorrow, beautifully pale. Behold thy power! on tree and meadow falls The loveliness of thine arraying smile. How silverly the sleeping air is robed Around me! Clouds above, like plats of snow Which linger on the hills, and laugh the sun Away with their white beauty, yet remain; And now they vanish, and the soundless heaven Forms one deep cope of azure, where the stars, Bright pilgrims voyaging an unwaved sea, Are strewn, and sparkle with incessant rays Of mystery and meaning. Yet not heaven, When islanded with all those lustrous worlds, Nor cradled Ocean with the waves uproll'd, Nor moonlight weaving forth its pallid shroud, Is so enchanting as that stillness felt, And living with luxurious spell, through all,— Silent as though a sound had never been; Or, angels o'er her slumber spread their wings, And breathed a sabbath into Nature's soul. No wonder moonlight made idolaters, That their Creator in creation merged As one surpassing Whole: for even I, I who have look'd with archangelic love On all the beauty and the blaze of heaven,— E'en I, the burning of my soul can feel Allay'd, when nature grows so near divine. And man, when passionless and pure awhile Amid the trances of unbreathing night With adoration in his eye and heart, He walks abroad, and measures at a gaze The starr'd immensity above, becomes Sublime; a shade of his primeval Soul Returns upon him; chaste as e'er it fell Heaven-ward the prayer-winged heart of faith ascends, Beholding Angels in excess of light, And joining in their chorus round The Throne! Sublime, but impotent, he then appears: The Fathomless, oh, who shall fathom? Time, Eternity, and Truth,—those awful Three That make the mystery God alone resolves. BOOK III. “On man, on nature, and on human life, Musing in solitude.” Wordsworth. And such the nature of this noble world! Magnificence and beauty, pomp and might Supremely glorify God's earth for man, The beatings of whose heart are heard in Heaven. The chant of seas, the jubilee of winds In forests heard, or playing their free wings Till the glad air is one abounding swell Of joy; Mortality's mysterious life And motion; and the thrilling tones of mind Which sound so awful on the sleepless ear Of Angels, watching like pure sentinels O'er human hearts,—such fearful stir of things In viewless worlds might well an echo wake. And may not he, the monarch of the scene, Be crown'd with glory, when he champions Time, Proclaiming what a vassal he hath been, And how great Nature hath his charm obey'd! The Elements—he made them servile powers, Or mix'd their spirit with his own; the Rocks Uprear'd—he scaled them to the clouds; The Ocean, thunder'd with her dreadful waves,— He braved them, and they bore him like a god! Yea, more; in haunts where desolation nursed The midnight Tempest howling for his prey, There hath the City piled her myriad domes; And Life her human scenery unroll'd. So vast his triumph o'er the varied range Of elemental being; but the soul For its omnipotence is most revered; How darkly-wild, how grandly undefined! Now sunk in dreams of unethereal bliss, Now glowing, gasping for infinity! Of Senses, inlet to unnumber'd joys And pains, all exquisitely toned and true; Of Feelings, wrapp'd as life-nerves round the heart Which throbs obedient to their lightning-call: And Passions, gods or demons as they rule,— Humanity may boast beyond decay: While Thought,—eternity is not too deep To fathom! she can sweep immensity, Creating worlds, and soaring on the wings Of awe, till, drooping like a weary bird, She drop in wonder to the earth again. With god-like attributes, ethereal powers Developed as the living soul directs, What grand perfections, then, hath Earth produced! Proud of his being, hear some child of clay:— “A Monarch holding empires in his grasp, Is great; Philosophers who fathom depths Of mystery, and plunge their minds in gloom, That ages may grow brighter, are sublime: And Genius, when by inspiration wing'd, How gloriously the heaven of thought she mounts, Fronting Jehovah with undaunted eye As eagles gaze undazzled on the sun!— Then, may She not the crowning laurel wear, The purest of perfections?”—Further yet; Methinks I'm challenged to admire a man Adorn'd with meekness, graced by holy love, And in the noiseless vale of humble life Content, and charitably good; whose name Is nobly register'd in realms divine, Though unrenown'd below,—for men forget Th' obscure in earth are oft the famed in heav'n. These proud examples of terrestrial worth Oft deify man's nature, and exalt His dignity to such a seeming height Of inward greatness, that it spurns away The dimming memory of a primal fall, And magnifies him to his first estate Of glory. What am I, then, if this earth By sin be all unblasted? Not a Shape Of woe, the prey of agonising fires, But Seraph, with his raiments roll'd in light The hierarchal prince of heav'n!—If Man Be undegraded, Hell is but a sound Of falsehood, dwelling in the soul of fear. Yet, judge them by their greatness, what are men? Of imperfection is true wisdom born, And vaunting knowledge, ignorance confess'd. The Unknown, when reveal'd, is not the new; It was, before his mental vision saw, And soar'd into a certainty; when seen, The blindness of the past is proved, and Earth May wonder, but she might be humble, too. There are, who feel true glory but a ray Of triumph over imperfection shed,— Which looks the darker when the gleam is o'er— When night hath deepen'd, and the massy earth Lies cover'd with cathedral-gloom, abroad Some starry Watcher roams, and 'mid the far Array of planetary worlds, like Saints In bright procession marching to the Throne Of their Creator, spreads his wandering soul, Till in the contemplated God absorb'd The Man is nothing, and his wisdom, dust! Nor dare he boast, as if perfection crown'd His being, who can most himself unearth; And from immortal beauty of the mind Reflect the imagery of heav'n around;— E'en he, whose gratitude in sunshine hails The smiles from God's own countenance reveal'd, Which flutter round his soul like fairy notes Of music melting into magic there,— Yes! he is boastless; though he soar sloft Till Fancy, awe-struck, wait with folded wing Before the blaze of Deity!—for dark To him the meanness of this sin-worn earth, When, breaking from a cloud of holy thought Wherein he dreamt, and high communion held With visions of a viewless world,—again He hears the rolling waves of life, and sees The gloom and turmoil of created things. But if beneath the brightness of the soul A shadow of degraded nature sleep, To make it humble, then how far removed From primal virtue are the men whom Vice Imbrutes with her foul spirit! Well, indeed, Hath Hell with Heaven divided empire won; How widely, let the watching Angels speak! Who frequent shudder with regretful awe When gazing down the wild abyss within To view the passion-waves which billow there, The gloom, the stir, and tempest of the mind! To such, the blackness of the Past is known!— Within whose bosom lies entomb'd a mass Of crime, by sinful myriads heap'd:—the Curse Lies buried with it, till the trumpet-blast Be sounded and the sleep of Ages burst For retribution; then will wrath awake, And I, the doubted One, shall stand reveal'd! And what a burden of unheeded sin Upon the death of each departing hour Is borne into eternity! the Past Was roughen'd into storms of savage guilt: The present, with a milder aspect tempts The judgment; 'tis a most polluted calm! Beneath it, in their soul-corrupting power The fest'ring tides of passion act and live; And when they burst o'er all prudential banks To riot in the public view of man, Then, Evil! thou indeed art god confess'd. Oh! it is laughter which allays our pangs To see these clay-born Upstarts, who were framed To re-erect our fallen Thrones,—amerced Of favour, all their glory dimm'd and marr'd, And they, contented at the car of Vice To follow, fetter'd by the chains of hell! First in my train of ministers behold Assuming Pride, who lifts her lofty eye To Heaven, as though in scorn of its dread height; And when She bends it to the earth, surveys All creatures but to dwarf them in a glance Of stern comparison. But nobler far, Appears Ambition, whose prophetic voice So fired my own proud nature, that it dared Jehovah's thunders in full roar to face! In all my tempters there is no such power, Such mingling of the demon and the god As that which in Ambition dwells. The soul Of Virtue, by her hallowing spirit touch'd May emulate bright seraphs, with a love Divine, through this dark pilgrimage; but rare On earth is such sublime ambition found, Or seldom would she waft a soul to me! She haunts the lowliness of life; there, shapes Her phantoms wild, or glittering delights. But oftener she assumes a warrior-mien To make a hero; stirs him with the sight Of banners flouting a defiance; plains And battle-hills with throbbing echoes rung: He rides a charger in victorious dreams And wakes a Hero!—let him gash the World! Ambition prompts that Genius in the mind, Which mortals on a throne of Magic seat, Most heavenly-bright, without a shade of earth, Her nature a nobility! the great She magnifies, the mean she can exalt, Lend virtue majesty, on vice a veil, The all-adored,—creation for Her charm! Enrapt, and raised beyond the clouds of sense, And all which coarse reality perceives, She wanders forth, and views the budding morn Freshen the pale sky, like that infantine glow Which o'er the cheek of waking Beauty steals; And night,—the paradise of dreams expands Before her, when that sacred darkness smiles Unutterably glorious!—not a sound Abroad; the moon, an isle of loveliness; The stars hung beautiful, as all new-born And lavish of their lustre; She can dream Her spirit roaming some elysian Orb Deep in the luxury and bloom of heaven. All sights and sounds bring meanings to Her mind; The seas are mirrors of Almightiness; And winds, like terrible magicians reign And master ocean with a wizard spell. Whate'er is vision'd, she can make her own, Shaping the world to an enchanted sphere! Yet Genius oft is mad ambition's wing In shining motion flutter'd o'er mankind. Alone, she cannot conquer Virtue's height, Nor bask in her Elysium; for the Heart One single virtue wins a prouder claim Of eminence, than mighty Genius wears In deepest glory:—while that peerless race, Anointed demi-gods whom Fame adores, Are blinded into self-idolatry, Some unobtrusive child of Woe, through want And anguish doom'd to meet his aidless lot, Hath pour'd his spirit into fervent prayer, And clung so faithful to the cross of Christ That he is famous in the rolls of Heav'n, Where lies a Mansion waiting for his soul;— A withering, but eternal truth, to me! Next Avarice and Envy, meaner powers Of evil, aid me while I weave the chains Which bind the captives of Corruption down. The first, a boundless feeling: more or less A second nature to the human mind Whose self-love is the life of thought and deed; But in some bosoms kindling all its fire, And rendering man a hideous slave of self; Till the bright universe and all it boasts Becomes a Nothing, when apart survey'd From what it ministers to gain and gold! Mean wretch! the more he gets, the less he gives; For ever greedy, as the hunger'd shark Which scents the dead among the waves afar. Nature is nought to him; the darken'd soul Hath dimm'd his eye,—it glitters but for gold, And that will gladden his departing hour! For what so grateful to the clammy touch Of dying fingers, as to feel his gold, While, sighing o'er it with a farewell-gaze He mourns the nothing of the wealthless tomb! But though in such abasement I exult, There is an excellence which daunts my gaze With blighting glory; such is virtue's ray; It trembles brightly through the gloom of hell And though 'tis hated, must be there admired!— How nobly different lives that Son of earth Whose heart is large enough to hold the world! Benevolence is life and breath to him; He spreads it out like sunshine from the soul, Itself its own reward. Whate'er he views Can waken sympathy; the clouds and streams, The meadows, trees, and family of flowers, For each and all as livingly endow'd He feels a beauteous love, but gives to Man The throbs and throes of sympathy divine. For buried grief, and those retiring pangs Which prey unutter'd on the gentle mind, He hath a healing word; and from the joys That shoot and sparkle o'er the stream of life Who fetches out the flash of bliss, like he? A hoary parent clasping his brave boy, With eyes all running o'er with ecstasy; A sweet and fairy-featured Infant, sat In laughing beauty on its mother's knee, That rocks it into rapture; or a pair Of lovers, looking in each other's eyes As though the lustre of unclouded years Were in them, beaming with prophetic glow,— O'er these, and every sun-burst of delight, Benevolence can wave her angel-wings And find in sympathy the soul of joy. To pay me for such pure excess of good Why, who art Thou with eye of dead-like gaze And care-worn aspect, on thy haggard cheek, The seal of woe, and stamp of agony?— Fiend of the heart, on man inflicting Hell, And Envy is thy name! though often crown'd For Emulation, by thy martyr'd slave; But she, proud Spirit! walks a nobler sphere: And when, amid the madness of the storm When skies are rack'd asunder, and the sea Lies rolling in the rapture of its strength, She longs, to be the queen of Elements Sublimely o'er a thousand tempests throned; Or views, the starry natures, till her own Seems panting to be bright and pure as they; Or, fired by dreams of intellectual fame, Hath gazed on Glory till her eyes are dim,— A generous and god-like Thing appears. But Thou art unredeem'd! a burning mass Of self-made misery, tortured by the curse Roll'd back in vengeance on thy horrid Self, Though breathed for others with malignant scorn. Merit is misery to envious eyes, That look themselves to anguish, when they mark Some high-born quality of soul or mind They cannot rival;—yet their very hate Most cruelly a false perfection gives To that pure excellence they long to crush, Conceal, or wither: thus the secret worm Can gnaw the spirit to its vital core! And hence, that scowling eloquence of eye: While Beauty, with her fairiness of form, And looks of light, like those by angels cast; Or Wisdom, laurell'd with unfading wreath Well earn'd, and woven round an aching head Where thoughts have throbb'd like pulses in the brain, Each beat a torture!—likewise Youth and Joy, Two smiling phantoms on the wings of time, Are blasting spectacles to envious hearts. Thus envy images the pang of hell! In secret preying with its vulture-tooth, Or haply easing its infernal rage In deeds of horror, whose unslumb'ring guilt Is vengeance:—how it haunts the craven wretch! By writhing hell-flames o'er his tortured sleep, And building oft the gallows which he dreads! What though he shroud his spirit with a veil Of outward gladness, artificial smiles Are smiles of agony; and when alone By some rude shore, where sullen waters roll Like gloomy fancies through a guilty mind; Or, doom'd to hear the sobbing of the wind, The melancholy drip of midnight-rain, And death-tales, faintly knell'd from far-off towers, The calm is burst, the buried thoughts arise With ghastly violence from their fell tomb; The spirit storms with anguish, and Despair Feels half the hell it shudders to foresee! Far wider, and more deadly in his reign, Is Lust; the malady of souls impure That fills the senses with lascivious fire, O'erheats the fancy, and to dalliant thought Presents all beauty moulded but for shame. And such is passion, when by truth survey'd, Anatomised, and seen! Yet lewd-soul'd men Romantically vile, decoy the hearts Of virtue, and disease them by a word Whose smoothness hides the shame its meaning hath. Foul passion is the poetry of vice And beautifies corruption. Hence the mind That would have loath'd its undisguised attempt Enchanted by delusion, locks its eyes In fatal slumber, till the veil is torn, And all the terrors of remorse begin! Yet Hell cannot deny on earth there glows A spirit scarcely weaken'd by the fall,— The soul of feeling, and the sun of life, Queen of the Passions, all-persuasive Love:— And could they with the bliss of man commune Fiends would be charm'd by pure affection's smile! Ethereal essence, interfused through life, Is Love. In orbs of Glory spirits live On such perfection; and on earth it feeds And quickens all things with a soul-like ray: The beautiful in its most beauteous sense; And symbolised by Nature, in her play Of harmonies,—her forms, her hues, and sounds: In each, connexion aptitude and grace Reside. Thus, flow'rs in their infantile bloom Of sympathy; the bend of trees and boughs; The chime of waters, and caress of winds,— Betoken that they all partake a sense Of that sweet principle which rules the world. And yet, though Love a human seraph be When pure and blest, by circumstance deform'd It turns a Demon, in the heart enthroned, That drains the life-blood out of Virtue's breast! For many, gentle as their wishes once, When Love smiled round them with prophetic ray, With hearts by disappointment torn and rent And spirits blasted with the blight of wrong, Are driven onward through a wild'ring course, Untemper'd and untamed. So flows the stream, Which ever nurseth its delicious calm, Till wrung by nature into torrent-force And foaming reckless through the wild! And Thou, The Star of home, who in thy gentleness On the harsh nature of usurping man Benign enchantment beautifully shedd'st, Soft as a dew-fall from the brow of eve Or veiling moonlight on the tempest thrown,— Woman! when love has wreck'd thy trusting heart, What port remains to shelter Thee! Too fond And o'er-intense thy truthful nature is, Save for the heart's idolatry and dream; And then, to virtue's path thy love allures:— It dawns, and withering passions die away; Low raptures fade, pure feelings blossom forth, And that which Wisdom's philosophic beam Could never from the wintry soul awake, By love is smiled into celestial birth! So love is wisdom with a sweeter name. But love attracts not Me!—I cannot love; For curses are the essence of each thought As writhes my spirit on a rack of fire. Oh, Vengeance! ere I heard thy thunders roll, With what delight I roam'd Heaven's bowers among, With kindred Angels, and elysian Shapes, Amid revealings of seraphic love!— But here, in low-sphered earth, a shadow dwells Of its divinity. In virgin youth When feelings are as foster'd buds of joy And freshness, from the spring of soul within, While the full gush of tenderness awakes Like spirit-music in the mind,—the heart For love is made, and owns its magic true. And now, earth wears the attributes of heaven! Two hearts are one, two natures are transform'd Each into each by sympathy of soul; What words in looks! what love in every tone! Moonlight, and azure sleep of cloudless air, Eve-walks, their mildness and romantic hush, How beautiful for lovers' placid vows! Then love, Enthusiast! ere the drossy world Corrupt thee; soon shall sorrow dash thy lot With bitterness; the spell shall then unwind, And Evil woo thee to her envious arms. Love is the revel of a summer-ray, The shadow of a heaven-sent dream; once gone, 'Tis gone for ever! darkness shall invade Thy spirit, and the green delights of youth Drop witheringly into barren age, When love remains a memory and a tear. Next, Jealousy, the curse of tainted love, Or causeless agony, by selfish thought Endured, a minister of Evil makes: Who haunts unseen some haggard spot, to hear The night-air panting with a rueful swell, Like sadness from a loaded bosom heaved. Her victim!—she hath blister'd his fond heart And through his veins a fiery venom pour'd; His mind is torture, and that torture, hell! The world is changed, corrupted, false; and cold As autumn when the bleakest rain-dews fall, To his delightless gaze. For damning proof All shades of accident cohere; he storms And doubts,—despairs and doubts again,—then tames His wild suspicion into sullen calm, Dark as the stillness of a thunder-cloud. And what of her, so fatally beloved? Still beautiful and fair; but on each charm The profanation of some fancied Eye Hath dwelt, which haunts him like a hideous gaze! Thus Jealousy the mind gangrenes, till thoughts Feed on his soul like agonising fire And wither him to madness!—oh, how oft He wakes, and watches the suspected One, When from her soul the light of slumber breaks, As though it dreamt of sunshine and of flowers! But dreams it thus for him!—To-morrow comes And Jealousy renews her rack again. “This world how fleeting and how vain! Our joys Are blossoms torn by each tyrannic wind; Our pleasures, but the painted dreams of air; Our hopes, they light us onward to the tomb!” Morality, how musical thy tones Upon the lip of smooth Hypocrisy! And such a strain, how sweetly does it lull The idiot-ears of undiscerning men, Who see in words a shadow of pure deeds And think the tongue the heart translates. The world Is rank with hypocrites!—a coward-race Of such ignoble vileness, that they shame Temptation, though they track its hellward path. Who bravely dares the censure of mankind, Pays dear for Vice, but reaps her value too, In full and free enjoyment: but the Slave Of hidden sin is ever Torture's fool, Proving his own avenger. Many seem The mantles which adorn your hypocrite! Behold him now, a most unruffled man Smoother than waters sleeping in the sun, To common gazers,—now, a courteous Shape All delicately civil! full of words Well rounded into gracious compliments; Or else, benevolently mad, with purse In hand; Misfortune, dip thy finger there! Neglected Want! for you it opens wide; And, oh! ye soft-lipp'd dealers in applause, Resound the dews of mercy as they fall, And crown him famous, Charity's own child! But why?—it pays a penalty for sin And bribes the Conscience, while it gilds a name. Then mark yon Hypocrite of pious mould, For ever putting on unearthly moods And looking lectures with his awful eyes. A sun-like centre of religious zeal, So pure, he would be better than the best! True virtue is a heavenliness of mind That, in the mercy of a mild reproof, Sheds healing sympathy o'er human woe. But he is cold, uncharitably good; Dealing the thunder-bolts of sacred Wrath With apostolic vengeance.—Mighty heaven, What lip-work are his pharisaic prayers! And like a sepulchre among the young Or gay, when, clouded with an envious gloom While death and judgment threaten from his brow, He comes where youth and innocence embrace To talk of Time and Change,—how gaping tombs Their dead await to sleep in darkness here; Or sternly paints some portraiture of sin,— But feels himself the model whence he drew! There is another and a fearful slave I love to train—the glory of revenge; A ruin which develops Me, and prints The die of evil in its deepest hue On erring souls,—The Atheist! with his creed Of darkness, brooding o'er the sunken mind Till Truth deny her nature; and the man Live like a bubble dancing on the stream Of time, which sparkles, and is seen no more,— A Nothing with a name! But since the soul Is effluence divine, the inward rays Of Deity cannot be quench'd: the God Is clouded, yet an indistinct and dread Religion, in the cowering spirit dwells. Since Egypt worshipp'd her material gods Through all the pantheistic gloom of Greek And Roman ages, Deity hath reign'd, Though hid in fabling wisdom. Where the mind To pure conceptions of a perfect God Ascended not, on wings of terror raised To see Him as he is,—the Awful One, Who wields eternity and portions time, Commands a deluge, or dissolves a world!— The Passions shadow'd forth fantastic gods, As Fear, or Wonder, or the dreaming eye Of Pagan Luxury sensualised the soul, And fancied heaven the heaven of each desire! An Atheist,—he hath never faced an hour, And not belied the name he bore. His doubt Is darkness, from the unbelieving Will Begot, and oft a parasite to sin Too dear to be deserted;—for the truth That unveils Heaven and its immortal thrones, Uncovers Hell and awful duties, too! Meanwhile, I flatter the surpassing fool, And hear him challenge God to bare His brow, Some Orb unsphere, and show Him all sublime. He challenge Heaven! an atom against Worlds! Why, angels and archangels, who have bow'd Within the shadow of His Throne, and felt The beams of an emitted glory burn Around them, cannot comprehend His might, Nor fathom his perfections:—what is Man! If Nature fail, then Reason may despair. The universe with God is stamp'd: who sees Creation, and can no Creator view,— To him philosophy will preach in vain: A blinded conscience and a blasted mind Are his; Eternity shall teach the rest! Yet who the Summer, that bright season-queen, Hath hail'd, beheld the march of midnight-worlds, The Sun in glory, or the realm of Sky When kingly Thunders in sublime array Ride the dark chariot of the rolling clouds; Who that hath seen terrific Ocean frown, Or moonshine ripple o'er the rocking waves In smiles of beauty,—all this living might And motion, grace, and majesty of things, Nor caught some impulse which believing heart Might share, and crown it with a creed sublime? A soul so dark, so miserably vile, Is form'd to grace a burning throne below, And teach the Devils atheistic lore! But there are others of unheavenly hue; A mass of creatures, by the earth beloved, Who bear a seemly fame; caress their limbs And senses; smile on Nature, when they please, And walk through life, as children by a shore Who sport, and laugh, and pluck the sandy toys Which glitter on their path—yet sometimes pause With thinking eye, to mark the scene august Of ocean, like a vision, heaving wild:— Too mean for virtue, too polite for vice, The happy medium which their spirits keep Is fitly toned to temporal joys:—they live As though Hereafter were this life prolong'd, And drown all instincts of diviner growth In plots and plans whereby the hours are wing'd.— Lo! one is fearful of the traitorous Winds Wafting a sailing palace o'er the deep; What fancy-shipwreck overwhelms the soul! What billows ever rocking in his brain! Another hath some mountainous ascent Of Life to vanquish, where a rival stands And triumphs o'er him with a mocking gaze: Though Angels whisper to his heart, return! Still must he onward up to Glory climb. Then comes your Zealot! weeping Country's wounds; And yet, with what a yell of pleased delight, As screams the vulture round his future prey His fancy revels o'er a ruin'd land! And thus, protected by his patriot name, He lives on vileness which his tongue creates. And such are these, who make the middle class Of creatures, wedded to the dust they tread, But doom'd to wrestle with contrasted lots And Life's predestined woes. There droops a man,— Poetic sadness in his pensive eye, As haunting tombs, or scenes beyond the dead! And here, a victim of tempestuous thought, Wolf-eyed, and glaring out his wilder'd mind In glances lit with-torture!—while, to mock Their meaner anguish, see a soulless Thing Appear, whose spirit bubbles out in song: And such is life,—a paradox at best! Here dwells my power; in living things which grasp The spirit, or that blind it with a glare Reflected from bright scenes of earthly pomp That curtain up eternity. No truths Divine, no energies which pant for heaven, In the cold depths of carnal spirit play; But he who from his soul the sensual chain Uncoils, and looks into Life's holier things, Wears attributes beyond the reach of Hell. Then, Time is no enchanter, though his cup May sparkle, and with brimming sweets be crown'd: The shadows of that far mysterious World Faith images, o'er time and scene prevail, And gather round him like a guardian-spell. Not such the earth-adoring million prove. When this world dies, the next begins to live! With fearful sternness on the inward eye It flashes, till the daunted mind start back Aghast, like Fancy from a hideous dream! At that deep hour, when dwindling to a blank Dim Earth departs; and those dear sounds of life Which once prevail'd so eloquently sweet, Grow faint and dismal, as the dreary voice Of waters gurgling round a drowning man,— The solemn meanings of the past are known. What prophet spake in every funeral knell! How oft the hearse-train, stealing through the rush Of sounding pathways with a spectral glide, The vision of a dying moment gave! And he, the victim of unvalued hours As home he went from halls of festive glare, The moon, night-weary, and the sallow dawn In sickly lustre o'er the Orient spread— How oft the nothingness of life he felt, And dream'd the tragedy Death suffers now! But these are moods unwelcomed and unloved, The sad intrusion of a sober thought, A cloud pass'd o'er the summer of his mind, And laugh'd away in lightness, or in joy.— The dead, the faded and forgotten dead! The progeny of Ages, who have breathed That breath of life which all the living breathe, Have walk'd beneath the same blue sky, and hail'd The Lord of brightness which illumes their path, Inherited the same mysterious dust, And form'd like them a link in nature's chain,— Have shrunk away, like shadows into gloom, And who laments them? They, the fair and young, In the prime bloom of spousal years, who seem'd Too beautiful to die; and Fame's proud race Of Heroes, o'er whose bier a Nation wept; With all that number multiplied can dream Of mindless creatures dancing round their tombs, And mocking at eternity!—are plunged And buried in the unremember'd past, Yet, few dare meditate their dying hour! Oh! did the living but the dead recal, As often as the dead the living do, The Sun would gaze upon a purer world Than now;—but let the dead remain the dead! Thus Pleasure teach thou my philosophy; Thy truths are sweet, thy curses all conceal'd! Never may Wisdom's heaven-communing eye To these, the earthly and the low, reveal That sounds of Folly pierce the gloom of hell; That tongues of Torture syllable their names In regions where inflamèd whirlwinds roar! Back,—back to this forsaken Orb of life Fain would a perish'd Father come, to dart One glance upon an unbelieving child, To breathe one sigh of warning round his soul!— May never men of whisp'ring Angels learn How heaven is brighten'd when the earth adores. BOOK IV. ?“We gather honey from the weed, And make a Moral of the devil himself.” Shakespere. So weak and yet so wonderful; so frail In act, and yet so splendidly endow'd For action, are the race of Men abhorr'd, That, view them in whatever rank they move, Through fields of Glory which the warrior treads, Or in proud realms of wisdom, fame, or power, An awful distance from their primal State Th' Inheritors of our scorn'd heaven have stray'd! No longer now the bright and palmy Sons Of God, but giants of iniquity, Or Anakims of intellectual vice, And helmeted with sin, the rebels stand, Who fight against the Lord of life and death, And make their crimes immortal as themselves! That primal State!—had evil not prevail'd, A heaven in miniature this world had been. Her paradise! I see it as it rose In youthful splendour on my savage eye! A starry jubilee still rang; the wings Angelical of many a hovering Shape Still hung and glitter'd on the virgin air, Which seem'd one atmosphere of melody! As yet, no cloud was born; the sunshine fed The flowers with beauty, till the twilight dew; Birds exquisite, with dazzling plumage clad, And butterflies, bright creatures, rich as they, Like showers of blossoms from a tree upwhirl'd, On starry wing hung trembling in the breeze, More glorious yet!—from Eden's mount I gazed, The emerald bloom of whose untrodden hills Lay jewell'd o'er with amaranthine flowers, And saw two Creatures of celestial mould. Till these were made, companionless the World Appear'd; and like a heart suspended lay, All throbbing for the Vision that should dawn! And they were fashion'd,—breathing shapes of life, With radiant limbs, whose robes were innocence, And eyes that spoke the birth-place of the Soul! Again the star-chimed Hallelujahs rang With wonder! while a gush of rapture thrill'd Creation to her centre, till each breeze Was gladness murmur'd out of Nature's heart! And thus they rose,—that new-created Pair, In loveliness complete, with forms of light, Reflecting glory wheresoe'er they moved. The one did mark the blue immensity Above, with a majestic gaze, and eyed The Sun, as though he felt himself akin To his pre-eminence, and kingly state: The other, in her fair perfection seem'd A Shape apparell'd by her own pure smiles,— Surpassing beauty, and subduing love! While ever as she moved, the blush of flowers O'erveil'd her, and a breezy host of sounds, Like magic birds, embosom'd in the air In sweet attendance caroll'd round her path: Never hath young romance, or shaping dream, Divined the vision which in Eden lay,— Each sound was music, and each sight a heaven! Oh! it was glory, that with blighting rays Flash'd in fell triumph on these envious eyes, Thus to behold the darlings bright of heaven, Created, form'd to fill our Seats above! Obedient, and they vanquish'd me; my doom Of darkness would have set, without one gleam Of vengeance for the living pangs I feel. I plotted,—tempted,—and the earth-born sunk From heaven's embrace into the arms of hell, Henceforward to enclasp a world of souls! Then, what a withering the Elements Of life and being felt!—corruption pass'd Through human into natural Things: the Earth Was barren-struck; the guilt-abhorring Sun His beams withdrew; the rivers howl'd with dread, And deep the blast of desolation blew: A curse came down, and Eden was no more! And now, from his primeval state dethroned, His very form o'ershadow'd by the sin That, like a breath-stain on a mirror cast, The beauty of his god-like mien eclipsed— I look'd on Man, a remnant of despair, But gloried as I gazed!—for then, the tongue, That tameless member which o'ermastereth all, E'en in an atmosphere of God himself That grand deceit of erring souls began,— Where guilt is flatter'd, and the heart secure! Creation shudder'd! for mankind were lost, Till God the seal of mystery should break In him foredoom'd to bruise the Serpent's head, And re-awake the hymns of Paradise. Meanwhile, the Evil triumph'd o'er the Good: And, exiled from their Eden-home, begirt And guarded with an ever-living flame, Two fallen Creatures on the race of life In sorrowing loneliness appear'd. Time lash'd His years along; but evil with them moved, Till Death in fratricidal fury came!— How Life hung shudd'ring o'er his glazing eye When pale, and dash'd with many a bloody hue, The prostrate Abel in the gasp of death Lay stretch'd; while Cain, a maniac child of Hell With lines of anguish working on his face, Stood by, and knew himself th' embodied Curse! Crime revell'd on, the peopled earth sank deep In ruin, till the great Avenger woke; Then came a Flood, a desolating tide, Which deluged sixteen hundred years of sin! Methinks I hear it now! so fiercely howl'd The waves and whirlwinds of that dreadful hour.— Dark prodigies, disasters in the sky, Announced it; yet these heralds were contemn'd: Still Blasphemy went hooting at the heavens, And mock'd the Elements with impious joy. The sun went down in sorrow; and the moon Rose pale and icy, as an orb congeal'd; While, ever and anon, there came a sigh Of Air, so spiritually deep and sad, It seem'd to issue from an Angel-heart That ached to look upon a dying World, Unconscious of her coming pangs:—thus Hell Prevail'd, save o'er the sacred few. And one The wicked counsell'd, glorious, and as good; A hoary Patriarch, who would haunt the shore, And hear a prophet speaking in the wind, And prescient terror in the sound of waves, Like mystery, mutter'd into Nature's ear; Then darkly muse on some high-gazing rock, And shape out Immortality!—But when The skies were blacken'd to a cloudy sea, Whose rage came down in cataracts, Despair! The racking universe was all thine own. And never were such horrid shadows frown'd Upon the Waters, as thy victims threw, When all aghast, in their avenging ire They heard them ravenously sweep along, As roaring for their human prey! Such sounds Of wo, such shrieks of madness never rang, Such eyes were never to a God upturn'd, As mark'd this dread, unutterable hour! A palpitation in the womb of Earth Began, then upward burst a buried sea, That whirl'd the mountains on her waves, and heaved The rocks, and shook the rooted hills abroad, Till darkness and a deluge cover'd All!— Save that which in the wilderness of waves Triumphant o'er a weltering chaos rode, And bore aloft the burden of the world! Yes! these were dread catastrophes of old, Loading with awfulness the tongue of Time; Unparagon'd as yet: but 'tis decreed, Another Day of unimagined doom Shall come, a deluge of devouring fire That now is redd'ning in the cavern-depths Which eye hath pierced not, ravenous for the hour When Earth shall wither into shapeless air! And I,—no matter! mortal years remain, And souls for ruin, ere my sun can set! So fierce the sway of evil, and the power Of will, o'er reason and religion's voice, That though a thousand deluges had been, Still the vile earth my sceptre should command. The teeming volume of the Past unroll, And from each page what lesson may be cull'd? A moral justice sways the course of Things, Guiding them on to their eternal goal. From evil, evil, and from good, a good Is born, each one a payment in itself, Its own avenger, or its own reward. I thank thee, Passion! blinded by desire Thou seest it not through every track which years Have furrow'd on the travell'd sea of Time. By tears of torture, wrung from out the soul Of penitence; by arrows of remorse; The inward hell in guilty bosoms found; By retributions in the wrathful shape Of elements, and dangers wing'd by death; By frenzied Glory, that will venture on Till dash'd to ruin by her own renown; By each and all of such avengers Crime Hath paid atonement to the Law of Life, And agonised o'er that which is to come. E'en Nature, in her elemental round Of living wonders, a re-action shows, In semblance to the moral law reveal'd By human destinies. The poise of worlds Which make infinity a beauteous thought; The Ocean, panting as the tide-queen wills, In ebb and flow of everlasting waves; And that communion of the earth and sky By heat exhaling water into clouds, And clouds returning in the showery rain— All teach a balance of prevailing power. But thou, Reviver of departed days! By whom, as beacon-light for time unborn The past might well have risen, hast forgot The law of retribution in thy love Of fame, and adoration to the dead. A War awakes!—what poetry is here For History to picture into life And splendour, making infamy sublime! The armies rally,—vast machines of Mind Half demonised, with one concent'ring heart To animate and harmonise the whole; The clarions ring, the banners chafe the breeze, Earth trembles to the haughty-footed steeds, And cannons thunder till the clouds are thrill'd! Then comes your “Hero” sprinkled with a shower Of blood,—how gloriously sublime he seems! Yet Kingdoms mourn, and trodden myriads lie All dead, and stiff'ning in the moonless air. But, should re-action for heroic crime, Or lavish conquest, smite a tyrant soul, A human vengeance not a Hand Supreme, Is traced; and retribution reason'd down, As though life circled on the wheels of Chance! Thus, when a Despot, weary of renown, In sorrow to a throneless gloom descends, How History flutters round his agonies! And so the living, who the dead recall, Are written into sympathy with shame; While they, whose words are wisdom to the pure, Rise dimly vision'd on th' historic page, Where infamy in glowing language lives. Thus may it ever be! let ages gone, Whence monuments, by sad experience piled, Might o'er unheedful days a warning frown, Like buried lumber in oblivion sleep; Experience is the sternest foe of hell. And though progression be the native soul Of all things, human or divine, while Pride Can hear no prophets breathing through the past, Progression will be lame, and Nature slow In her advancement to that heaven-like scene, Prophetic rapture in its vision hail'd; While frequently, an earthquake-shock will come, Forcing the world a century back again In vice and darkness, sucn as once o'erthrew The Roman empire and her subject-isles. Upon the forehead of these fearless times I know the haughtiness which now exults: But let the modern in his pride beware! Corruption is the strongest in the best, And knowledge wasted, worse than ignorance proved. A moral, not an intellectual life Alone, however rich with mental bloom, God's Image in the human soul reveals: And so taught He, that co-eternal One On high, when leaving his Elysian throne, He templed his bright Nature in the dust Of dim Mortality, and unbarr'd heaven Whose gates of glory now expanded shine. Philosophy, benighted in the gloom Of Pagan wisdom, fondly charming oft The shade and silence of Athenian groves, How failing in her eagle flights!—To clear The clouded intellect was her prime aim: The heart, that fountain-source of sacred life, Rank'd second in the mental scheme for Man; And thus, her wisdom in a weedy soil Was sown; and perish'd in its mortal thirst For feelings, which refresh the growing mind As spring-dews foster the awaking flowers. But Christianity, the child of Truth, With searching light the inward nature clear'd, And by a conscience, rooted in the soul, And fears, from which unfading hopes are born, And faculties of faith, which all possess, Awoke the mind to wisdom, pure as heaven. Spirit of Vengeance! would that I could hide One living God, surpassingly supreme, Parent of mighty worlds, pervading each, The First and Last, Immortal, and the True; The Son of his Eternity, from Heaven Sent down, embodied in a human mould; The Same upon the cross hung crucified, Incarnadined with His redeeming blood For fallen nature flowing, till the Earth As in an agony did rock and heave, While bowing angels worshipp'd in amaze, And hell grew darker with despair!—a Life Unending, shared by an existent soul; A Resurrection, when the dead shall wake; And, crowning all, the doomsday of the world; When every eye must see Him in the clouds, And time be swallow'd in eternity,— Would that all this infernal hate could hide, Which Devils own, and tremble to believe! But thanks to man, man's most inveterate foe, How oft, perverted, hath Religion proved That curse she came to cancel and destroy! By Bigotry, insatiate for the blood Of martyrs; by the shadows and the clouds That dream-eyed Innovation form'd and fed,— The clash of Evil with the growth of Good Hath half repaid me for the realm I lost, When dawn'd salvation on the sinking world. And now there is an animating throb, An energy, and daringness of thought, Awaken'd like one mighty pulse through lands And isles, remotely set in ocean-gloom. But if the Heart uncultivated lie Amid the reign of intellectual power,— Though, basking in the sunshine of her hope, Philosophy of perfect minds may dream, She builds a vision, baseless, proud, and vain, As ever revell'd on the eye of sleep! For o'er the heart a vicious mind shall rule, And poison each aspiring germ of thought, Till Talent prove but wickedness inspired, In baneful glory towering o'er mankind: So be it!—Hell shall blaze a bright applause. No, not till spirit over sense prevail, And mortals to the awfulness of life Advance, shall Earth a brighter visage wear. And such, methinks, Creation might reveal.— A Sea, for ever sounding with his voice Of billows, “Might and majesty are here, And in eternity my waves have roll'd;” And Sky of living glory, when the storm Lies back with fury on a sea of clouds, Or, arch'd in beauty, shadowless and blue: With all the wonders, swarming on each spot Of being—hint they not an awful shade Of Mystery unreveal'd, yet claiming thoughts Of solemn hue? And then, while hours depart, (Myriads of spirits passing to and fro From life and light, to darkness and the grave, While feelings, words, and deeds, whatever mind Betray of good or bad in ceaseless pulse Of action, register'd above, remains For judgment,)—bear they not, as on they roll, A burden, and a meaning most sublime? Yet who, in nature or in time, reveres A sense and shadow of diviner Things? A spectacle to angels and to God Is Man, while acting on the stage of time,— Such truth the soul of inspiration breathed: And what a meaning centred in the thought! Around, above, beneath, where'er man lives And moves, unvision'd Natures overhang His path, and chronicle his history. But o'er this pomp external, and the life Of sense, such beautifying veils I throw, That men become idolaters to sight, Naming all else the nothingness of dreams: A wisdom worthy an infernal crown! Why, if a bead of water in its orb Of motion hath contain'd a countless host Of beings, limb'd, and full of perfect life; If not a leaf which flutters on the tree, But is empeopled with an insect swarm; If not a flower by fairy sunrise charm'd, But in the palace of its dew-drop dwell Unnumber'd beings, that in gladness live; Then why not, O ye self-adoring wise, A world of spirit-natures, though unseen, In number rivalling what creation yields? And vacancy, that hueless void of air Which men unanimated space define, Be pregnant with aerial Shapes of life? Yet better is such blindness for the cause Of Evil; would it might eclipse the race Entire, of all who have a soul to save! For some can dare the prison'd mind unbar, And view Reality behind the veil Which mantles their mortality. And such The pale enchantment of a moonlight-hour, When the soft skies are fleck'd with silky clouds, In veils of beauty floating on the breath Of heaven, and stars in pensive light appear The bright mementos of eternity,— For high communion with celestial Things Employ: such spirits never in their clay Are dungeon'd; but in demi-paradise Do wander, reaping holiness and love.— And Guilt too hath her hour, when Spectres come Array'd in fury, till the air grow dark With demon-wings, and terror shrieks my name! But this deep sense of something Unavow'd Pervading nature, which the purer mind May in some beauteous trance of holy thought Perceive, and which the ghastliness of guilt Oft tortures into life,—o'er few prevails: In vain have heaven-taught Seers a coming World Foreshadow'd: visions of unearthly blaze, And princely Seraphs over empires throned, And Dreams which were the delegates of God,— Of such vast wonders deep-voiced Prophets tell. And now, in riper days, when men have crown'd Themselves with false perfection, not an hour But hints a spirit-nature to the soul, Howe'er unhallow'd! Whence that prescient sense Of peril doom'd to come? those guiding thoughts Which helm the fancy with mysterious sway? The heaven of feeling when a God descends? Or mystic sorrow, which melodious strains Wherein the spirits of the dead revive And home and childhood have a pictured life, Oft o'er the heart of lone Bereavement brings? Or, all which sound and scenery suggest Of purity and grace?—The scoffer doubts! And by that sneer his inner-light destroys. Yet Angels are there, watching o'er mankind With tenderness and eyes of heavenly love. The same who, when the World-awakening trump Is sounded, shall the buried dead untomb For Judgment, and its awful throne sustain. These Agencies divine, howe'er men veil Their viewless presence mid the thrilling cares Below, are often in their glorious range Of wisdom, by the plotting Evil-powers Encounter'd, with defiance and despair! Visions of sunshine and of music made, Where the bright soul, entranced with melody, Communes with Seraph-watchers, are of heaven. But whence that fancy-roll of billows, heard In darkness, deluging the wilder'd brain With hideous murmur? or those formless Things Which hang and blacken o'er the shudd'ring frame? Or whence that tongueless blasphemy of mind Making the heart to shiver, and the eye To gaze behind, as though a prompting Shape Of Evil stood there, muttering hell-framed words? The fire, the fury of appalling dreams, Whence is it?—rend the veil, and ye would know Proud victims of an unbelieving heart! That such are demon-haunters of the earth, Who horrify the vision'd world of sleep, And pall its midnight with infernal gloom. Who wonders, the dark Mysteries of life And hidden Beings of unearthly power Are smiled away for superstitious creed, When He, the Ransomer of lost mankind, Whose Name a starry herald to the sage Reveal'd, and at Whose birth the heavens were bowed, To millions less than many a Hero seems,— A Myth incarnate priests and fools adore! A Saviour, Son of the Most High, enthroned Amid the hallelujahs of the blest, I saw Him ere the universe began; When space was worldless, luminously fill'd With emanations of vast Deity; I saw Him when immensity His voice Obey'd, and nothing startled into worlds. And did I not, be witness, Powers below! Bear on my brow the lightnings which He wreak'd, Because I would not to His Godhead bend? Without Him, and this withered Earth had sunk To hell, for ever blasted by that word Of vengeance, which her frowning Maker spoke, Who cannot His eternal nature change: Immutable in majesty, in truth, Or else His Infinite would finite be; And therefore, by His attributes, the Law When broken, should to violated heaven Atonement offer;—where the Sacrifice? Till God for God, and Man for Man, appear'd In wondrous union of incarnate power, Hung on the cross, and saved the guilty world! I hate Him, and his everlasting cause, The Church, upon the rock of ages rear'd, His word, His truth, and heaven-directing sway; And soul by soul, and heart by heart, through light And gloom, by land and isle, through life and death, 'Mid all the legions of embattled Powers Who on His Ministry attend, and war For holiness—my hate shall dare Him still; Though Truth may vanquish, and the viewless thrones Of Darkness tremble with their last despair! Too deep the vengeance of atoning Blood On me shall come, for Him to be forgot! I hate Him, for the ruin'd world he saved: And yet His glorious pilgrimage confess. Sublime of Martyrs! in that dread career What wonders hallow His remember'd way! The blind awaken'd to the bliss of light, The deaf and lame, the dying and the dead, All yielding up infirmity to Him, And putting on young attributes of life. Vain mortals, read and tremble! Once the Sea, That god and glory of the Elements, Obey'd His fiat, when a tempest rose, Till the huge waves like living mountains leapt In the wild majesty of midnight-storm, Mocking the haggard lightnings as they streak'd The waters, in the fury of their flash. Each billow was a tempest; and the ship Groan'd like a mariner at his last gasp; Up rose He in almightiness! and bade The whirlwinds into silence, and rebuked The Ocean, calm'd by His resistless Eye! And then, His Passion!—that tremendous scene When God incarnate for the guilty bled, While throbbing earth seem'd echo'd with His pangs Almighty, and eclipsing horrors veil'd The sun, which darken'd while its Maker died; Or else, the midnight over Calv'ry's mount Incumbent, coward fancy should have seen! Have heard the cloven rock-piles as they burst, The tombs unlock, and mark'd the solemn dead In pallid stillness gliding through the town As moon-clouds gleam along a midnight sky! This grand array of miracles, this might And majesty of preternatural things Reveal'd in mercy, to arouse the world To perfect sanctities of word and deed, Have,—hear it, Demons! with exulting shout, Fail'd! Long may Nature turn a slighting ear To that true voice, which since Messiah bled, By lips Divine and eloquence of life, When, holiness the Christian heart inspires, Hath testified that Virtue is the heaven Begun, and vice the seed of Hell in man. Delusion is the soul of young desire. Behold a Vessel which has never braved A sea: before her gallant bosom swells A blue extent of ever-bounding waves, All sunny-crested, glowing like the noon. No stormy menace in the welkin frowns, Sea, shore, and sky are in one mingled calm; Loud, deep, and full the voice of welcome rings, Away she flies in glory o'er the deep Exulting in the wind!—And such is Youth, So bright the promise of life's onward way; Beneath the sunshine of fond hope awhile The victim basks; drinks deep of every cup Enchanted, feasts the faculty of sense, And hails each hour the herald of new joy; Thus on! as though unfading bliss were found, Till weariness awake; the wing of joy No longer o'er his soul a freshness waves, And like the moody air he often breathes A sigh of sullenness around his path. And now, the verdure of delight no more, The heart uneasy, and the soul unsaved, With that dark fever of condemning thought, Which conscience frets from out the sated mind, As here the brute, and there the man, prevails,— Behold your slave of pleasure rot from year To year; obeying sin, yet feeling guilt; His present, darkness, and his past, despair! Of finer mould and far sublimer view, Whate'er his lot, on Fortune's envied mount High-throned, or lost in the secluded vales Of lowliness,—is he whose hopes are built In heaven; the hateful, but triumphant still! Not all the pomp and pageantry of worlds Such glory on the Eye Supreme reflect, As the meek virtues of one holy man: For ever doth his Angel from the face Divine, beatitude and wisdom draw: And in his prayer, what privilege enjoy'd! Mounting the heavens, and claiming audience there,— Yes! there, amid the sempiternal host Of Seraphs, hymning in eternal choir, A lip of clay its orisons can send, In temple or in solitude outbreathed. I loathe the bright, the beautiful, and good, By man when mirror'd forth sublimely fair; Yet how, the hero of the Cross deny What Hell may hate,—but hating, still admire? One universal love, the source and end Of true philosophy, within such heart Must dwell, and make the atmosphere of mind All sympathy, wherein a good man breathes:— A tear for sorrow, and a smile for joy, Are ever his; and thus existence spans A wider realm than the self-loving fill, Who crawl about their own mean world. Not man Alone, the empire of his heart contains In its free compass of embracing thought; E'en gentle nature wins a share of love; From the frail being of a lonely flower By earth forgot, in beautiful ascent Up to the very clouds, which in the shine Of heaven seem bathing with voluptuous joy, And here I face the triumph of a soul In such fine overflow of sympathy,— However spread, 'tis unpolluted still: As sunshine in its beaming intercourse With earth, shines pure upon corrupted clay. Then, Virtue hath a loveliness, a calm So fresh and full, a blessing and a hope, With such elysium of contented thought,— Rejoice I may, but ever wonder more To see her so forsaken. Her delights Endure as rich above the hectic joys The wicked and the worldly reap, as hues Of nature on the rose-bright cheek of youth Outbloom the artificial blush of age, And blossom in the wintry gloom of life Unfadingly sincere.—Another source Of heaven, there opens on the virtuous mind, Which daunts me with a deep excess of good,— Pure sympathy, which makes the Past its own By following where the great and glorious dead Traced the true path which terminates in God. Art, Love, and Wisdom, Nature and her scenes. Each from association prompting force derives. When in the coolness of declining day As o'er autumnal woods brown evening falls, In haunts where solitude hath breathed a soul,— By Thought companion'd, oft the wanderer feels Such sympathy, the while of good and great He thinks, who loved like him the lonely hour, Still walks, and dreams, and meditative joy. And that prime bliss, perfection of delight, Which is to ear what beauty is to thought, Sweet melody,—methinks 'tis only framed To nourish heavenliness, in hallow'd minds; There, how refreshingly must music flow, And faint into the soul,—as dewy sleep Melts o'er the eyelids of a weary man. These holy yet another triumph crowns. In woes which blacken o'er the brightest lot How loftily above the bad they tower! While those whom faith, nor resignation calms Become a ruin, haunted by despair; Save, when gay thoughts from gloomy moments spring, As bright-leaved flowers that in the sunshine bloom, From the chill damp of earth and darkness sprung. And such the life which virtue seems to boast; With gladness lighted, or by sorrow dimm'd, Still wearing a contented smile, to meet The great Approver: like a placid stream That in its meadowy pilgrimage can wear The aspect of a pure and gentle thing Alike where sun-beams laugh, or shadows frown.— And when the summons to a future State Is heard, those hell-black phantoms of despair, Those clouds of horror which the wicked dread, Melt in the brightness of a better world: Thus, arm'd with faith in Him who vanquish'd death, A gentle summons from their Lord to meet The angels bright and beatific souls Who erst have battled in the war of life,— Death comes, and wafts them to the waiting Skies. And such is truth!—in heaven and hell the same. And Hate herself in agony avows, That Virtue is triumphant, and the best: Her glories are my tortures; but they shine Upon me, blasting with victorious light The envy which I bear them, when I scan The mazes of mortality.—How kind In men, to aid the darkness which I bring On fallen nature! lauding what I love, And hating all which Fiends abhor. Thus vice In splendour will appear, while virtue droops, Like a long shadow pining in the sun. And never shall the good the bad exceed, While Sin can put enchantment in her smile, And Passions are the tyrants of the soul! Thou dread Avenger! ever-living One! Lone Arbiter! Eternal, Vast, and True; The Soul and Centre of created things, In atoms or in worlds; before Whose Throne The universe recoils; who look'st—and life Appears; who frown'st—and life hath pass'd away! Thou God!—I feel Thine everlasting curse, Yet wither not: the lightnings of Thy wrath Burn in my spirit, yet it shall endure Unblasted, that which cannot be extinct! Thou sole Transcendency, and deep Abyss From whence the Infinite of Life was drawn! Unutter'd is Thy nature; to Thyself Alone the comprehended God Thou art. Though once the steep of Thine almightiness My tow'ring spirit would have dared to climb And reign'd beside Thee, god with God enthroned, And vanquish'd fell, Thy glories Fiends confess. Immutable! omnipotence is Thine; Perfections, Powers, and Attributes unnamed, Attend Thee; Thou art All, and oh, how great That Consummation! Worlds to listening worlds Repeat it; angels and archangels veil Their wings, and shine more glorious at the sound: Thus, infinite and fathomless Thou wert, And art, and wilt be. In Thine awful blaze Of majesty, amid empyreal pomp Chief Hierarch, I once irradiant knelt Thy Throne before, terrifically bright, And heard the hymning thunders voice thy name, While bow'd the Heavens, and echoed Deity! Then heaved a dark and dreadless swell of pride Within me! an ambition, huge and high Enough to overshadow the Supreme, In bright magnificence before me tower'd, And fronted pride against Omnipotence! Thus rose the anarchy of mystic war The skies amid; then met embattled Hosts In unimaginable arms divine:— But why recount it? Spirits disarray'd God hurl'd in flaming whirlwinds to the deep Tartarean, where the Demons wait their doom. And yet, divided empire have I won. Behold! the havoc in Thy beauteous world: And have I not, be witness, space and time! Thy master-piece, creation's god of clay, Dethroned from that high excellence he held When first man walk'd a shadow of Thyself! Prostration vile, an alienate from Thee Man is;—and shall his fallen nature rise, Enter bright heaven, and fill ethereal thrones? Many a cloud of evil shall be burst Ere that day come: severe and dread the strife Of earth-born passion with the soul of man! Wherever localised, whate'er his creed, Fiends of temptation shall his soul beset, Though every pang, by sin produced, increase The agonised eternity I bear! The blackest midnight to the brightest day Is not more opposite, than I to Thee: Thou art the Glorious, I the Evil one; Thou reign'st above; my kingdom is below; On earth, 'tis Thine to succour and adorn The soul, through sacraments of secret grace, By thoughts divine, and agencies direct; To cheer the gentle, and reward the good, And o'er the many waves and woes of life To pour the sunshine of almighty love: 'Tis mine to darken, wither, and destroy, And in destruction see the heaven of hell! Then roll thee on, thou high and haughty World! Still be thy sun as bright, thy sea as loud In her sublimity, thy floods and winds As potent, and thy lording Elements As vast in their mysterious range of power, As each and all have ever been: build thrones And empires, heap the mountain of thy crimes, Be mean or mighty, wise or worthless still,— Yet I am with thee! and my power shall reign Until the trumpet of thy doom be heard, Thine ocean vanish'd, and thy heavens no more! Till Thou be tenantless, a welt'ring mass Of fire, a dying and dissolving World! And then, Thy hidden lightnings are unsheath'd, O God! the thunders of despair shall roll; Mine hour is come, and I am wreck'd of all— All save eternity, and that is mine! BOOK V. “This royal throne of Kings, this sceptred isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars— England!” How gloriously the festal chimes resound Their pealing gladness through the azure night, And thrill the air with jubilee and joy!— As though the triumph of ten thousand hearts In full-voiced chorus shook the starry heaven, And made it conscious music! Now they swell Aloft, in one excited wave of sound; Then, faintly die, like war-notes on the wind, Rousing the empire with a brave delight. England hath laid her sceptre on the Deep, And, with her thunder, chased her ocean-foes Like leaves before the breathing of a blast! England hath rear'd her banners on the plain Of battle; victory waved them; and the world Again shall echo with her haughty name. And hence, a stormy rapture shakes the isle; Hence the loud music of her steepled fanes, Whether in cities emulously tower'd Among the skies, or in lone hamlets seen,— Still pouring out the language of the land; With all those pageantries, and fiery pomps, That hang and glitter from her window'd piles Emblazed with mottoes, and triumphal scenes. Not one, to whom the name of country sounds Like heaven-born music, but this hour adores. The old men feel the sunshine of far youth Returning, fresh as when the hero glow'd. The young,—lip, eye, and daring heart, are stirr'd; Their very blood seems rippled with delight, So deep the fulness of this warlike joy. Yea, hollow cheeks of Sadness, and the brows Of Poverty, and lean-faced Want itself, Forget their nature in a share of fame! And yet, most hideous are some human shapes Which revel near me, by a tow'ring blaze Of triumph;—as it flings its glaring life Upon their faces, each one gleams beneath The mockery, like a ruin'd shrine when noon In bright derision dances o'er the walls. Let Fancy to a distance wing her flight, And learn the glory whence this scene is born. How Sorrow treads upon the heels of Joy! What puts a smile on some great Empire's cheek, Hath wrung the life-blood from another's heart; While one is revelling with impassion'd glee Another moans like misery's bleakest child: Thus seems the world a round of joy and wo, Alike divided for the doom of things. Hither, thou frantic Bacchanal! whose voice Rings loudest, stand upon the hoof-scared heath, And say if Heaven on such a scene can smile! Here, deep as in thine own exulting land, Night reigns; but not with noon-like azure crown'd, While sympathetic stars, all gaily bright, Look down on gladness: but with sullen calm Where moans the conscious wind, and pensive stars Seem pale-eyed watchers o'er those trodden dead, In tombless havoc weltering on the plain. Each heart now cold, to other hearts was chain'd, Whose links were out of years of fondness framed; Each eye now darken'd with eclipsing death Once beam'd the sun of happiness and home; Each of the dead hath flung a shade o'er life, Henceforth to be a living agony.— Mark! where the moon her icy lustre flings What dead-romance! what visions of the slain! One, calmly-brow'd, as though his native trees Had waved their beauty o'er his dying head; Another, marr'd with agonising lines And dreams of home yet lingering in his face.— Now go, and sing the splendour of the War! Go, tell the Mother of the brave and free, How beautiful this patriotic shout Of Victory, when she counts the new-made dead, Like Madness reeling with a murd'rous joy; So shall a war-fame flourish ever-green, And laurell'd History be trumpet-tongued, To fire ambition with a bloody thirst, Which makes the world a slaughter-house for man! And this is “glory!” such as charms these days When godly temples every street adorn; While Tenderness, with its bewailing lip, At ages of barbaric gloom affects To wonder:—how the heart its flattery weaves! Of proud deception, or intense desire, The victim ever in its wariest mood. To be the bulwark of a land beloved, And drive aggression with avenging sword From her indignant shore, commands renown: But say, Thou Centre of created life, Who charter'd man, and bade Thy heavens to mile When from his eye outlook'd the living God! What myriads upon myriads heap'd, to fill The circle of ambitious thought, or please Some royal dreamer who would dash a throne To hear his trumpets pealing through the world,— On hill and plain, and ocean's ravening waves, The red libation of their hearts have pour'd! But this is kingly:—so let tyrants dream; Nor round their pillows may one death-cry ring: The day, when dust shall give its monarchs back,— Methinks I see it, and the fiery glance Of Judgment scathing many a royal soul! But night departs, the revelry is o'er, And nature woos me. Through the orient heaven A dawn advances with a beauteous glow; And now, array'd in clouds of crimson pomp The gradual Morn comes gliding o'er the waves Which freshen under her reflected smiles, And veils the world with glory. Rocks and hills Are radiantly bedeck'd; the glimm'ring woods And plains are mantled with their greenest robe, And night-tears glisten in her rosy beam. But in yon valleys, where from ivied cots Like matin incense, wreathing smoke ascends, How exquisite the flush of life! The birds Are wing'd for heaven, and charm the air with song, While in the gladness of the new-born breeze The young leaves flutter, and the flow'rets sigh Their blending odours out. And ye, bright streams, Like happy pilgrims, how ye rove along By mead and bank where violets love to dwell In solitude and stillness: all is fresh, And gaysome. Now the peasant, with an eye Glad as the noon-ray sparkling through a shower, Comes forth, and carols in thy waking beam Thou sky-god! reigning on thy throne of light. Sure airy painters have enrich'd thy sphere With regal pageantry; such cloudy pomps Adorn the heavens, a poet's eye would dream His ancient gods had all return'd again And hung their palaces around the sun! And this is England, bathed in morning glow: The isle where Freedom bears a lion-mien, The Land whose echoes thrill the earth around, The ocean-throned; the ancient battle-famed, The Palestine of waters! O'er her realms Enchantingly propitious Nature smiles; Whose frowns and awfulness are seen afar, Where snow-hills whiten in eternal glare, Or soundless ocean, lock'd in icy sleep, Deadens the polar world: but here alone With summer hymning through the haunted vales, 'Tis beauty, bloom, and brightness all! How rich The scented luxury of floral meads, Reposing in the noon; where gentle winds Exult, and many a choral brooklet sings: Sure Admiration might be poet here! Tall mansions, shadow'd by patrician trees, Romantic farms, grey villages and cots, With castled relics, and cathedral-piles Where dreaming Solitude can muse and sigh, Enchant dead Ages from their tombs, or hear The dark soliloquy of ancient Time,— Adorn the landscape and delight the view; While haggard rocks, and heaven-aspiring hills The sea o'ergazing, here and there create A mountain-charm to solemnise the scene. Or turn from Nature, in her fresh array Of beauty, to behold the haunts of man, In high-domed Capitals or cities huge With varied grandeur round the island spread; Here towers and temples overshade the streets Where sound the life-floods in continuous roar, And Commerce, whom the winds and waves revere, To him whose veins are proud with English blood, A scene suggests that bids the patriot glow. Then Ocean,—listen, how th' intruding waves With loud resentment trample on the shore, Like pawing steeds, impatient for the war! And such the magical array of things By art and nature o'er this island strewn; Than which, though envious clouds her sun Conceal, and vapours curtain oft the sky, Heaven canopies no lovelier clime. And they, The children of her Freedom, with an air Of kingliness they walk thy consecrated soil, And thoughtful manhood, on their brows enthroned. Though perfect beauty lost its moral grace When Sin unmask'd her hideous front, and shades Of hell rose frowning o'er this human scene, It reigneth still; as mind though overthrown And darken'd, yet hath gleams of glorious prime. And here, methinks, a noble beauty dwells These islanders among:—the daring eye, Majestic brow, the gallant bloom of health And dignity of their regardless mien A power denote, which beautifies the free: While they who move in loveliness and light, Like memories of vanish'd paradise Around the sternness of ungrateful man, Have beauty such as perish'd Angels loved! And yet, of myriads who this matchless isle From day to day enjoy, from year to year Environ'd with her fairest smiles, few dream Or whence, or why, she hath the world surpass'd. Thus hath it ever been, since time and truth Have wrestled with that contradiction, Man! Partaken mercies are forgotten things. But Expectation hath a grateful heart, Hailing the smile of promise from afar: Enjoyment dies into ingratitude, Till God is hidden by the boundless stores Himself created; eyeless nature knows Him not, for mighty Self absorbeth all! That gulf descend where pristine ages sleep, And lone, benighted in the savage gloom Of her untravell'd woods and wilds, no light, Save that of reason, struggling through a cloud Intense,—lo! haughty-featured England lies; An orphan region nursed amid the deep, A fameless isle, imprison'd by the waves, A speck upon the vasty globe. Who raised Her littleness to lofty state? who bade The daring majesty of Cæsar's mind O'er her rude wilds a Roman spirit breathe, Till, in the nursing shadow of his throne She grew to youthful glory? Who hath been Through perils, and volcanic bursts of war, Earth-shaking tumult, and appalling strife The guardian of her destinies till now, When Ocean, wreathed around her rocky shore, Hath lent his champion-billows to defend Her fame, while storming at her daunted foes, She spurns them with avenging roar?—Forth steps The little greatness of a learned man, And in the rapture of presuming thought Through the dim valley of departed years Sends down his spirit, and aloud proclaims, The prince, the hero, and aspiring hearts Which breathe omnipotence round mortal power, Have made, and shall preserve us, as we stand, The mighty and the free!—A proud response Of hell-born feeling such as I would nurse; And that which empires have of old indulged Till, dizzy with renown, they reel'd away Amid the havoc and the whirl of time. For power and greatness are the awful twins Of Destiny, whereby the earth is moved: The first, a property of God Himself, Which, when imparted to the soul, becomes A curse, or blessing, in its moral sway: The second will be judged by truthful Heaven Convicted, or absolved. Of England's past, When Time's dread chronicle shall be unroll'd What glory then will clear-eyed Truth perceive? Should I deny thee, angels would declare, That spirits who enrich eternity Have deck'd thine island-clay. Immortal kings, Who sanctified their sceptres, and their thrones; Patriots sublime, with whom hoar wisdom dwelt, And tutor'd ages by advancing thought; With saints and martyrs, heroes of the skies, Approaching, shed their glory on thy name. But paramount o'er all thy mental gods Shakspeare and Milton, see those peerless two! The one, a mind omnipotently dower'd, Which multiplied itself through space and time, Passing like nature through the soul of things! Aloft, companion of the Sun he soars Awhile, then travels with the moonless night, Mounts on the wind, or marches with the sea, And, god-like, gives the Elements a tone Of grandeur, when his spirit walks abroad! But Life! how well he tore thy mask away,— The great Interpreter of man to man. So royal are his kings, his maids so pure, Such perfect heroes, and prudential knaves, Such feeling smiles and unaffected tears, So stern or sweet, so melting or sublime,— Such life-warm substance in the vast array Of Shapes, who live along his moving Scene, Men deem the world were in him when he wrote, And he the sum and soul of all mankind! The last, who lived on earth, but thought in heaven, Beyond compare the brightest who have scaled The empyrean, and whose lyre might charm The seraphim with its melodious spell,— That sightless Bard, whose paradise of song Hallows Britannia's isle, how deep he plunged Into the infinite sublime of thought, Flaming with visions of eternal glare! How high amid the alienated Hosts Of warring angels he could dare ascend, Look on the lightnings of almighty wrath, Array the thunders, and their God reveal! These deities of earth, thy past sublime; The birth of an immortal soul proclaim, And show how far bright inspiration soars: But thou, brave England! shalt for crimes be judged, When they in awful resurrection rise With thine own children, ere the world expires. My Spirit hath encompass'd thee! Thy hosts Who in the anarchy and ruffian stir Of civil war, have won the sanguine wreath; Thy lewd-soul'd princes, and voluptuous kings Whose courtly halls were palaces of vice That sensualised the land; the sins untold Within thee nursed, and those remorseless deeds Of vile aggression, haunting thy great name,— Yet sully thee, and claim atoning tears. And now reigns England in her noon of might Secure; the future, with victorious eye Prophetically dooming; distant Lands Beneath her sceptre bow, and though her soul Doth gather wisdom from her own domain, In proud neglect of equal climes,—there spreads No empire on the map of earth, where fame Hath scatter'd not her mind's nobility. Commerce,—the spirit of this guarded isle Wherein the attributes supremely dwell Of all which dignifies or nurtures power,— Enthrones her on a peerless height, and works Like inspiration through her mighty heart, And yet, a poison at the core! To eyes, Where avarice hath raised a blinding film That flatters, while it bounds the view, her scenes Array'd and glowing with commercial pomp, More costly than the sun-enchanted skies Appear. Triumphantly outspreads her show Of trade and traffic round the sumptuous world! See! from yon ports what merchant-vessels waft, Daunting the winds, and dancing o'er the waves, Rich wares and living burden, while the breeze Toys with the flag, and fills the panting sail. Others from many a tempest-haunted track Return'd, in thunder beat their homeward way And send their spirit wreathing on the gales. Then hark! amid this wilderness of domes Dark lanes, and smoke-roof'd streets, what mingled roar, While Commerce, in her thousand shapes and moods With eager hand and greedy eye, pursues Her round of wonders and of gain! All arts, All natures, and all elements are forced To such obedience by transforming Power, That matter quickens into living soul And works harmonious to the will of man! But here, methinks, had not one hideous thirst For lucre parch'd all pity from the mind, The hollow cheeks and livid brow of Toil That, lean, and yellow'd by infectious gloom, Droops o'er his hateful task—might thrill the heart Of Selfishness, in her most griping hour. And here amid the pestilential glow Of heated chambers, where in sad revenge Art flourishes o'er fading life, are pent The infant young, and friendless orphan-poor; They who should gambol on the golden meads, While health the limbs, and beauty clad their cheeks, Thus doom'd to anguish in degenerate toils! Why, what a hell-slave will this Commerce prove, When life and feeling perish for her cause! Already hath an evil spell begun; Though a proud Empire will not see, her heart Is fever'd with a fest'ring mass of vice, And lust of gain which rankles into lies Deceptive, horrible, and base; while Truth Integrity and Honour are diseased, And die away in avaricious dreams Of Mammon, that vile despot of the soul. The happy meekness of contented minds Is fretted with ambition; home and love, The heart-links, and the brotherhood of joy In life, and tomb-companionship in death, Are nothing: money, God of England seems! There is another and a nobler scene Of triumph, for dark spirits to survey. For knowledge,—true nobility of mind When temper'd with a sanctifying tone, Without it, but an ornamental curse,— In full omnipotence is reigning now; Yet haply, with a spirit and a power Which breed an earthquake in the boastful heart Of this free isle. A thunder-charged sky When clouds float meaningly along the face Of its dread stillness, not more threat'ning looks Than England, bloated with ambitious minds That dream in darkness, and await the hour That like a storm-burst will the world arouse! Sooner shall winds be caged, or billows hush'd, Than pride be rooted from one human soul By aught which man's corrective wisdom yields. For dust with deity will dare contend, The creature with his own Creator war The most, where meek religion reigns the least. To vanity a wildering charm, for vice A weapon, to the fool a powerless gift Is Learning.—Doth she lift her eyes to heaven, Or downward gaze to idolise that world Of promise, which around her seems to smile? The soul of Intellect is spread abroad, In whose gay flush men see flatt'ring bloom; Yet, vain and unimpressive as the dance Of leaf-shades, figured in the dreaming sun, Are trivial fancies o'er a Nation's mind For ever by inglorious spirits thrown. As pictured Nature in the rich deceit Of servile art, undignified appears When with its glorious archetype compared, So dim the genius of the living day To that which brighten'd an heroic race Of warriors, famous in the fields of mind; High-soul'd and stern, they gave to time unborn The heirship of their fame; but venal smiles Which low accordance with the bounded view Of spirits levell'd to the dust, procures, Were spurn'd away in their immortal taste For Truth, and her transcendent cause:—how few Dare emulate these godlike of the past; Renown immediate, from the vassal lip Of smiling Dulness, is the dear reward For which your intellectual pigmies grasp. Hence, sickly woes, and sentimental lies By passion woven to bewilder souls.— Romantic panders! may your kingdom spread; Let Beauty, Love, and Gentleness, and Thoughts Which grasp eternity and heaven unveil, Expire; but give to crime pathetic grace And treat the world with new made decalogues! Creator! what a triumph can we boast When oracles which fool, or flatter; dull Expounders of a duller creed,—those mean Arraigners, shrouded by a saving gloom Which wraps them in false glory, as far scenes In darkness magnify the truth of Day; When such as these, in life and feeling, heart And creed, and elements of thought, can win A base surrender from a free-born soul Cringing, or cowering, as their wands direct!— Why, Hell may laugh, and liberty's no more. So awful is the sway of human mind: For good or evil an enduring charm, Inweaved with ages, silently it works, Reaping uncounted spoils from deeds and words, And thoughts, which spring like blossoms from a ray Of influence, by some ruling Spirit cast.— There is a stormy greatness, by the sense Of vulgar Apprehension hail'd, yet vain When match'd against one all-prevailing mind. A warrior's glory in his banner waves; And ocean-heroes, when the tempest roars, Outdare the winds; and echoes of renown Roll mighty round the living head of each, Yet ebb away to indistinct applause By History echoed round memorial graves. But he, who out of mind a fame erects, In his eternity of thought will live And flourish, till the Earth itself decays! And what a tale would Time have told, had none Burst through the thraldom of degrading sense, And bade the spirit eloquently tell Of Truth, of Beauty, and pervading Love! The heavens they scale; the elements array With glory; give the herb a greener hue, The flower a fresher magic, and the stream A melody which nature never sang; Thus bright'ning all without by rays within From light's great Source proceeding, they create A second Eden, pure as sinless Adam saw. The dark enchantment of corrupted mind Not less prevailing in its secret course Hath proved. For Havoc may be heal'd; and tears And wrongs of desolated Kingdoms, cease; But genius triumphs o'er decaying time And taints a century with corrupting thought. Ye prostituted Souls! when mind is judged, How ghastly from your slumber will ye wake! At that dread hour Perversion may not plead, Nor Will deny, what Understanding own'd. The wretched martyrs!—for a vain renown From Unbelief, and her heart-blasted crew Derived, they rouse the idiot-laugh, in clouds Of falsehood clothe each attribute within, Lend Infidelity a voice, the vile Delude with flatteries such as impious ears delight, And fashion doubts to mystify the world: So be it! there is loud applause below! For wealth too gasping, for a wise content Too madly fever'd by ambitious thirst, The moral greatness of this mighty Land Thus charms me with a promise of decay. Her heart is canker'd: I have roam'd unseen Around her; lightly do her virtues weigh Against the burden of her wickedness.— By fortune moulded, what a countless herd Who live to fascinate the palling hours With pleasure, making life one masquerade! Refinement is their heaven; and thus few crimes Are nourish'd there; but lesser sins abound; Revenge and spite, all vanities and hates, The virgin whiteness of the soul deform: Concealment is a virtue: virtue oft Bare policy; religion but a form, A taste most delicate for things divine! The truth, convenience; and a lie,—the same. And what a homage doth the tongue present To evil! what alertness of delight Attentive, comes it in whatever shape The turn of accident assume; in blood, Disaster, or some grand depravity Where passions like heart-demons reign'd! But tears Of charity, that language of the soul! Some fine denial of a feeling mind, Some noble act, or heaven-reflecting scene, Let such be named, and weariness begins: Nothing so dull as Virtues when admired! Let Slander, with her false envenom'd lip, Her aping mood, her sly assassin tone, Appear,—and eye and ear and heart attend To feed upon the foulness of her tongue; Whether on crooked limb, or character It fall; whether She waste it on a foe Successful, or a rival far too good; Or faintly drop it o'er a dying friend,— Nothing so sweet as slander to the vile! But deeper in society are bred The vices ravening on a Nation's weal. Philosophy! dar'st Thou confront me here? Descend and look into degenerate life; See deadly Vice, with brazen front, abroad, And Murder, stalking through her savage round Of midnight blood; see Theft her felon-hand Uprear; and infamies of heart and tongue; And Guilt, with godless triumph on her brow: Mark Hell in miniature! wherever crime Depraves, or poverty allures,—and pause; Millennium is not come, nor Man reclaim'd! Thus greedy, worldly, and defiled, how poor The sum of happiness in England's heart! Like other climes, her thousand children seek A Shadow flying from their false embrace, Still adding to the cheats of mocking time, And with strange madness making life far worse Than Adam left it. Earth indeed no more Retains an Eden, and her richest hour Yearns with deep longing for more glorious bliss, Immortal as the mind itself;—yet joy And hope, serenity without, and calm Within, e'en here might visit gentle souls, Who haunt the confines of a better world. Like food to body, happiness to mind Alone is healthful, when ingredients pure Are mingled to create the charm they bring. What numbers, on whose features the false smile For ever plays; whose eyes, so brightly charged With happy meaning, quicken envious fire In other hearts; what wretches gaily-tongued, And scattering words whence emulations spring,— Have I beheld, whom Happiness is deem'd With her full heaven to crown! yet where, oh where Blind Mortals, is that priceless gem obtain'd Which many seek, yet few in life have found? The palace, and the parasitic host Of minions, with that soft and sneaking race, Who in the court of princes lie away Existence, gasping for some golden lot, I've mark'd:—the happy do not flourish there! Then look'd I on a mightier Scene, where men Draw glory from a Nation's heart, and voice Their spirit round the listening World! How vain And valueless this haunt of mind has proved To all who battle for some cause adored! Oh, England! such as Rome and Athens paid Their architects of greatness, thou hast giv'n To many who bequeath thee fame. There live A host, who in the splendour of thy Great Live, bask, and breed, like reptiles in the sun; Who feast on venom, and infect the Land With malice, and all miserable wounds. Alas, Ambition! see yon gifted man A while stand forth, surpassing and sublime: His brow imperial; in his eye a blaze Of meaning, pour'd from a majestic soul; Borne on the whirlwind of triumphant thought Through the wide universe his genius sweeps! Thrones, Monarchies, and States,—he summons each To strict accompt, their victories and kings Arraigns, and bids Britannia front them all! The Senate wonders, rapture finds a tongue, And envy sinks abash'd to praise. But go, Young Emulation! when this glowing scene Hath cool'd to common life, and mark him well! The hero is no hero here! the mean Have tortured whom a Kingdom could not bend: Around him, too regardful, scandal flies; And words, like gnawing vipers, poison life Away, or rankle in the spirit's core.— From the proud Senate, to a sunnier realm, Where Gaiety and her unseemly crew, Like flowers of fancy in a hot-bed rear'd, An artificial life enjoy,—I turn'd. In such a sphere could happiness abide? Where Fashion, that great harlequin of Life, For ever plays the comedy of fools; Where Luxury breathes a pamper'd air; where Love Is venal; Wealth, a wearisome array; And time, a curse,—the happy do not dwell. A false delight, a snatch of feverish joy And jading rounds of pleasure are supplied; But oft the heart beats echoless to all Though Custom wear its contradicting smile. And the rank vileness of their pleasures vain 'Mid theatres of vice, I frequent view. Music and Pomp their mingling spirit shed Around me; Beauties in their cloudlike robes Shine forth,—a scenic paradise, it glares Intoxication through the reeling sense Of flush'd Enjoyment. In the motley host Three prime gradations may be rank'd; the first, To mount upon the wings of Shakspeare's mind, And view the flashes of Promèthean thought, To smile and weep, to shudder, and admire,— Attend; the second are a sensual tribe, Convened to hear romantic harlots sing, On forms to banquet a lascivious gaze While the bright perfidy of wanton eyes Through brain and spirit darts delicious fire: The last,—a throng most pitiful! who seem With their corroded figures, rayless glance, And death-like struggle of decaying age, Like painted skeletons in charnel-pomp Set forth, to satirise the human Kind!— How fine a prospect for demoniac view! “Creatures, whose souls outbalance worlds, awake!” Methinks I hear some pitying Angel cry. Another scene, where happiness is sought! A festive chamber, with its golden hues, Its dream-like sounds and languishing delights.— Since the far hour when England lay begirt With savage darkness, how divinely raised Art thou, Society! The polish'd mode, The princely mien, the acquiescing smile Of tutor'd lips, with all that beauty, love, Accomplishment and sumptuous Art, bestow,— Are thine; but oh, the hollowness within! One mingled heart society should be Of glowing words and generous feelings made, And hallow'd by sincerity; but hark, The whisper'd venom of invidious tongues! The shrug of falsehood, or the sly deceit Of changing looks; the drama of the eyes, And all the pantomime Refinement acts! From simpering youth to unregarded age 'Tis vapour, vanity, and meanness all! Where honest nature sickens with disgust; While school'd hypocrisy, with glozing tongue, Performs the social serpent of the night. From Fashion moved I to the loftier scenes Where hosts by Learning titled, for renown And rank more elevate than kings bestow Their inward toil pursue,—and yet how vain! There is a craving for some higher gift, A thirst which fame and wisdom fail to quench Alone; the fountain hath a deeper well. And what is Fame? When hope, the morning-star Of life arose, Enthusiast! thou wouldst climb Her envied rock, to hear the lauding tones Of grateful myriads round thee, like the glee Of waters wafted o'er a mountain-head. Amid the dreams of some poetic shade Where Fancy prophesies proud years to come; Or by some gush of beauty, or the glow Of emulation, or by spells of mind Perchance her music whisper'd—be thou great! No matter: midnight-watchings, gloom and tears, Thy heart a fever, and thy brain on fire,— The martyrdom of thought hath won the prize; And midmost thou, among the laurell'd tribe A Paramount art throned! And dear to thee, Young hero of the mind, is first renown; Fresh, warm, and pure, as early love, ere Time Hath nipt it with a killing blight. Awhile In paradise thou dream'st and seem'st to hear The hailing worship of Posterity. But now, come down from yon celestial height! Descend, and struggle with the heartless crew Who out of others' tears extract their joy. The rocky nature of ignoble minds, Ambitious Spite, or unrelenting Hate, 'Tis thine to wrestle with; the spell unwinds, And Glory's hollowness appears at last! And thou, religion, hell's appalling foe, Yet least prevailing, on whose seraph-wing Far, far away from this benighted orb, A spirit mounts, though many Temples shrine Thy sanctitude, and many tongues thy charm Repeat, how few have found thee as Thou art, The living Saviour of mankind! What hosts Who boast my attributes, or ape my power, Yet carry gospels in their saintly looks! Ye hypocrites! how often have I torn Your veils away! how often have I seen A midnight where the world saw only day; Beheld a Demon, where they dreamt a God! 'Tis not the vileness of hypocrisy From which alone a hellish harvest springs; But that contempt which on religion frowns When hypocrites in unmask'd truth appear: Then Vice is comforted, and lifts Her voice Triumphant; pleased to have a broken step However slippery, where to stand and cry, Thank God! my soul religion never sway'd! Delusion vain and exquisitely vile, How gloriously thy cheating spells can work! For thus might Painting and her fairy scenes Be scouted, when a daubing mimic fails; Or Music have her seraph-voice denied When a poor screech-owl apes a melody; As true Religion have her heaven disown'd Because a false professor fools the world. Nor dwells that happiness which mortals seek, With them, fanatically crazed or wild: Two Orders breathe there of this graceless crew: The one, on ecstasy profanely soar Full in the face of Deity, and sing And shout, with more than archangelic joy! And yet, so earthly is excessive love, No heathen to a sensual god e'er raved With more lip-service of degrading rant Than dark Fanatics, when their roar is up! The other, sink as deep as these ascend, And so exult in self-accusing thought, That nought's more proud than their humility. And this is homage for the Dread Supreme! Who comes—and Mountains from His glory flee; Who speaketh—and a Universe begins; Who frowneth—and Creation is no more! So awful, that the dazzled Angels shrink In veil'd humility His Throne beneath; To such these holy maniacs cry, and bid Him bow the heavens in thunder, and appear! Or, in the vaunting of devotion's power Can dare to humanise their Deity; While others, with a superstitious cloud Array His attributes, conceal His love, And level Mercy to their own despair. Nor let them boast, who in the vile content Of worldly meanness, sepulchred in Self And worm-like clinging to their genial clay, The wisely good and only happy deem Their narrow lot: to such earth-loving race The seen and felt make all their paradise; Should Hell be vision'd,—let it burn away! If Heaven—bombast is thunder'd in their ears! When yawns the tomb, then comes the hour to pray, When death appears, the awe of future worlds. Most glorious! could I wither all men down And tame them from their true immortal rank To what these are, how demonised the earth Would grow! all feeling curdled into self, All nobleness of thought a dream denounced, All bright and beautiful sensations mock'd, The world a vortex for engulphing heart And soul,—one living curse this Life would prove! Were I a mortal, with capacious mind To grasp, and heart to feel, around me strewn Such glory, pomp, magnificence, and might In visible array,—I'd rather live Some free-born creature of the stately woods, Than with the form of Man a life of brutes Embody, beathing but of earth and sin! Glory and Pleasure, Learning, Power, and Fame, All Idols of deceptive sway,—mankind Have crown'd them for the master-spells of Life; And yet, a mocking destiny they bear. How often dwelleth gladness in the smile They raise, or rapture in the heaven they dream? Unknown, unhonour'd, in the noiseless sphere Of humbleness, one happy man I found. It was not that the tears or toils of fate Escaped him; or that no tempestuous grief The stream-like current of calm life perturb'd. But in him dwelt that true philosophy That flings a sunshine o'er the wintriest hour. The proud he envied not; no splendours craved, Nor sigh'd to wear the laurels of Renown; But look'd on Greatness with contented eye, Then, smilingly to his meek path retired: Thus o'er the billows of a troublous world, As o'er the anarchy of waters moves The seaman's bark, in safety did he ride, His woes forgot, and left his wants to Heaven. I wove my spell, but could not once decoy The eyes of that contented Soul. He look'd, When Glory woo'd him with a traitorous glare, On the calm luxuries of humble life; There was the Image of his own pure mind, The peaceful sharer of his love and lot: What beaming fulness in that tender eye, What a bright overflow of spirit shone! When by her cradled babe she mused, who lay In beauty, still and warm as summer-air: And what could camp, or court, or palace yield, Of nobler, deeper, more exalted bliss, Than when, as weary Daylight sunk to rest, He shut his door upon the noisy world, And, with no harrowing dream of guilty hue, To stain the crystal hours of love and home, Sat by his hearth, and bathed his soul in bliss? But more convulsive is the life I'd see; And few shall flourish in this homely sphere! Excitement is my great enchanter, whence The wisdom of the worldly fain would reap That blissful nothing which delusion shapes; That onward, day by day, from year to year, Through gloom and glory mocks them to the grave!— I thank thee, Britain! though religious call'd, The perfect beauty of her living form Thou hast not yet adored.—There is a sense, A selfish, innate law of right and wrong, Which makes a heathen moral: such is thine. A loftier air the Christian breathes, who owns The Alpha and the Omega of all In life or destiny, is God alone. Bid colour to enchant the blind; or sounds Of melody through deafen'd ears to glide, Or dream of sensibility in stones; But think not, world-slaves! to imagine all That boundless yearning for ethereal bliss, That more than rapture of a heart redeem'd A Christian nurseth; 'tis the heaven-wove charm Which Devils hate, but cannot yet destroy. Divinity is there! Two thousand Years In glorious witness gather round mankind Attesting it divine;—to conscience, peace; To Ignorance, beyond what sages teach, It gives to poverty that wealth of heaven,— The inward quiet of a grateful mind. To such how welcome dawns this hallow'd day, The Sabbath! Hell perceives her darksome power Confronted, when its smile salutes the earth; For, like a freshness out of Eden wing'd, A sainted influence comes: the toils and woes, The cankering wear of ever-busy life In spiritual oblivion smooth'd away, On such a dawn, celestial hearts by grace Refined, can mingle in delicious calm Like many clouds which into one dissolve. How mildly beautiful this blessed morn! Thy sky all azure; not a cloud abroad; A sunny languor in the air; the breeze Gentle enough to fan an Angel's brow: And thou, the Lord of beauty and of light Enthroned, how oriently thy splendours shine And make a loveliness where'er they fall! Hark! on the stillness of the sabbath-air From tower and steeple floats the mellow chime Of matin-bells; and plaintively ascends That pealing incense! up to heaven it glides, As though it heralded creation's prayer. And now, from England's countless homes and streets, In motley garb, the trooping myriads come, To kneel in Temples where their fathers knelt. Among them, there are heaven-toned spirits found, Hailing a sabbath as the blissful type Of that which in eternity shall reign: Others, whom Custom's all-resistless sway Beguileth, in their pompous robes appear, And use them for religion; many pine For action, though a sacred mockery proved:— While the loud wheels of common Life stand still, And round it an unwholesome quiet reigns, The show and music of the temple-pomp May o'er the heart some fascination fling: Yet what more weary than to worship God! But now for Country, and her chaster scenes! The melody of summer-winds; the wave Of herbage in a verdant radiance clad; And chant of trees, which languishingly bend As gazing on their shadows, meet around This haunt, where Loneliness and Nature smile.— How meekly piled, how venerably graced This hamlet-fane! by mellowing age imbrown'd, And freckled like a rock of sea-worn hue. No marble tombs of agonising Pomp Are here; but turf-graves of unfading green, Where loved and lowly generations sleep: And o'er them many a votive sigh is heaved From hearts which love the sacredness of tombs. And such is thine, lone muser! by yon grave Now lingering with a soul-expressive eye Of sorrow. Corn-fields glowing brown, and bright With promise, sumptuous in the noon-glare seen; The meadows speckled with a homeward-tribe Of village matrons, sons, and holy sires; The hymning birds, all music as they soar; And those loud streams so beautifully glad With life and beauty all the landscape robe, And yet,—one tomb-shade overclouds it all! A churchyard! 'tis a homely word, yet full Of feeling; and a sound which o'er the heart Might shed religion. In the gloom of graves I read the Curse primeval; and the Voice That wreak'd it, seems to whisper by these tombs Of village quiet, which around me lie, Unmottoed, and unknown. Can Life the dead Among be musing, nor to Me advance The spirit of her thought? True, nature wears No rustic mourning here: in golden play Yon sprightly grass-flowers wave; the random breeze Hums in the noon, or with yon froward boughs A murmuring quarrel wakes: and yet how oft In such a haunt the insuppressive sigh Is heard, while feelings which may hallow years With virtue, spring from out a minute's gloom! Mind overcomes me here. Amid the pomp Of monumental falsehoods, piled o'er men Whose only worth is in their epitaphs, I fear thee not, thou meditating One! Infinity may blacken round thy dream Perchance, and words inaudible thy soul With dread prediction fill!—but worldly gauds Entice thee; whisper'd vanities of thought Arise, and though Life lose all glare awhile, Ambition tints the moral of the tomb.— 'Tis not so here: pathetic eyes can dwell On few distinctions, save of differing age; The heart is free to ponder, and the mind To be acquainted with itself alone. And more development of Man is found In such calm scene, than in the warring rush Of life.—I watch him thus, and mark How creed and conscience lift him up to God; Or dark imaginings, from tombs derived, O'erwhelm His spirit with a cold despair. Nature begins; and in the white-roll'd shroud The ghastly nothingness of Death appears.— And then, a knell, Time's world-awaking tongue, Rings in the soul, and by a new-turn'd grave He paints a mourning vision; sees the tears Telling of many a day's remember'd joy Down cheeks of Anguish dropping; and can hear The careless mutter of the broken clod Upon his coffin echo.—Then, a dream! The solemn dream! of where his spirit-home May be, and what the everlasting World. Thou mortal! ask the overarching Heavens, The mystic wind, the ever-murmuring Deep, And all which night and day around thee dwells: Doth nought reply? The elements all dumb? Then ask thy soul, there God Himself replies! I thank thee, Man! and all those mocking scenes Wherein such vassalage of mind abounds, That thoughts of death are exiled from the heart Of many, till the sepulchre doth yawn. Thus aid my black deception; and become The sole omnipotent mere sense obeys! And ever, when thou hear'st some true divine Of nature's teaching, a Hereafter tell, Then, brand Him as the martyr of mistake! Oh, think not, Worldling!—or thy soul would say The man who hangs on every smiling hour A coward proves to questionings of thought; While he, who dares with an undreading eye To fathom his own nature, in the grave Descend, eternity's deep gates unbar,— Unblasted can the face of God behold And grow familiar with the World to come. England is bless'd in all which nature lends: No fields spread greener magic to the gaze, No streams of purer freshness flow, no winds In richer harmony their wings unfold, Than hers: and though invading grandeur frown A heartless contrast o'er some ruin'd scenes; Though petty tyrants and domestic lords That elevating charm have long eclipsed Of happy peasantry, with honest hearts For country glowing, and for God prepared, And wither'd much by pastoral poets sang,— Enough for homage, or refreshing thought Doth consecrate her yet. And thus, methinks, Sweet Country might imparadise the soul, Where fine perceptions hold their placid sway. Grey towers, and streets all surfeited with throngs Of worldlings, greedy-eyed, and stale of heart, As the dead air around them,—who should deem Enchantment, when a lovelier world is free? From dusky Cities, where forced nature grieves To wear the meanness of surrounding men, On wings of gladness might her lovers fly To haunts divine as these. Lo! how She laughs In sunshine, tinting with her bright romance Hill, wood, and valley, rock, and wayward stream;— What arch'd immensity of bending sky! What flowery hues, what odorous delight And, as her gales on wings of freshness come, What ocean-mockery from th' excited trees Is heard, in rapture echoing the winds! Yet well for me, that Town's eventful sphere Enchants the many more than nature can. No sound melodious as the roar of streets; No sky delightful as the smoke-dimm'd air Above them, like a shrouding death-pall hung; No joy prevailing as the selfish stir Whilst interest, craft, or petty wants produce, And on Life's stream those fleeting bubbles raise, In bursting which their day-born wisdom lies. Why, this is taste Corruption should enjoy! She cannot fancy what she never felt. There is an outward and an inward Eye, Reciprocally moved; when that which sees Within, is dimm'd, the eye of outward sense Is darken'd too; creation wears a cloud, And life a veil; when both are bright and free, The world of nature and the world of man A garment of celestial glory wear! Both form and mind a fellow magic steal Where the free visiting, of nature act: As the fresh lustres of a cloudless morn The languor of a dying eve excels, So doth the beauty of yon country-girl Surpass the city maiden in her charms; The rich enamel of the rosy blood Is painted on her cheek; and her glad eye,— From the full joy and glory of the meads, The freedom of the woods and waterfalls, And the proud spirit of her village hills Its glances come!—her step is like the breeze; Her forehead arch'd, to face the skies; her form, Perfection out of nature's hand; and words, The native breathings of a happy soul. Nor less in contrast to the bolder mien Of city-manner, is thine artless air Whom now a wanderer in the fields I view, With sunshine lovingly around thee thrown. A sweet unwillingness to be observed Dwells in that maiden-glance; and oft away From the bright homage of adoring eyes In delicate timidity thou glid'st; Like a coy stream which from fond daylight speeds To hide its beauty in sequester'd dells. Yet Fashion does, what Feeling would deny; Making a charm where none is found: thus, hills And lakes, the mountain-winds, and sea-fresh gales, The idle from their town-retreats allure, When fair-brow'd Spring appears. And some there live Among them, of that undetermined race, O'er whom the earthly and the heavenly sway With fitful interchange, mere Epicenes In mind. Worn by the hot and feverish stir Of city-life, the many-mansion'd views, Those pathways bleaching in the glare of noon, And the fierce clatter of conflicting wheels,— Some wearied heart romantically sighs “O for the luxury of living gales, And wafted music of ten thousand trees, Whose young leaves dance like ringlets on the brow Of Joy, and glitter gaily to the sun! O for some deep-valed haunt, where all alone, Saving the mute companionship of Hills, My feet may wander, and mine eye exult!” So wish'd a Worldling; and behold him come, And roused by new enchantment, thus exclaim: “Again thine own, my heart, I give to thee Sweet Nature! once again thy fondling breath Of music plays around my faded brow, Pure as a father's blessing o'er a child Forgiven, gently murmur'd. Let me look With eyes impassion'd on this glorious scene. Dilated, as with gladness, glows the blue O'erhanging sky, untinctured with a cloud: Around me, hills on hills are greenly piled, Each crowning each in billowy ascent And beautiful array: a breeze is up In bird-like motion winging the bright air; Or by the flow'rets, giddy with delight, And dancing gaily o'er the golden meads. Nor am I lonesome in this hour of bliss: The grazing flocks which speckle the glad fields; The larks; and butterflies that tint their path With beauty, and yon group of laughing babes, Fit company for sunbeams and for flowers, So brightly innocent they seem,—partake The heavenliness of this romantic hour: And thou, beneath me in thy waveless mood Luxuriant spread, with ripples twinkling gay As insect-wings which flutter in the sun, Calm Ocean! often has thy phantom swell'd Upon me, in the rush of busy life, With smile as glorious as thou wearest now.”— And canst thou, with a mind thus deeply toned To all which nature for congenial heart Provides, again be mingled in the mass Of vulgar spirits, and their vain employ?— Yes, Worldling! earth is heaven enough for thee. No marvel, when by moral rust decay'd In each perception of ethereal growth, That millions never know a joy sublime, And call romance the sin of tender souls.— How little do these menials of the mind From their blind prison-house of earth perceive That moods predictive of diviner scenes Come oft inspired; and though morosely scorn'd, Form inward foretaste of the Unreveal'd. But this enchantment of reposing thought, When solitude falls heaven-like on the soul Reflective, soars above thine aimless gloom, Retirement! When in fame or fortune wreck'd, To make a winter where bright summer reigns And sadden all things with sarcastic gloom, The misanthrope to his dull haunt retires For saturnine felicity; tis vain. For as the deep, unvisited by wind And motion, tainted with pollution lies; So turns the stagnant heart to foul conceits, Unholy fancies, and unhealthful thoughts; The world must wake it, as the angel stirr'd The healing waters into glorious life And motion,—making them to bless mankind. Oh! how I scorn false Eremites! these mock Philosophers, most elegantly sad, Because outrageously befool'd. The man Who battles nobly with his lot, and starves Without a tear, hath more philosophy In his true nature, than your Sages dream, Who mope, for want of sterling misery! But lo! a vision fair as fancy sees. Beside yon Deep, alive with laughing waves, An infant stands, and views the billowy range Of its immensity, with lips apart Like a cleft rose hung radiant in the sun,— Hush'd into sweetest wonder. How divine The innocence of childhood! Could it bloom Unwither'd through the scorching waste of years, Men would be angels, and my realm destroy'd: With eyes whose blueness is a summer heaven; And cheeks where Cherubim might print a kiss, And forehead fair as moonlit snow,—thy form Might be encradled in the rosy clouds At twilight grouping amid the sun's farewell, So gentle and so glowing thou appear'st. And heavenly is it for maternal eyes In their fond light to mark thee growing day By day, with a warm atmosphere of Love Around thee circled with unceasing watch; While, like a ray from her own spirit shed The lights of waking thought begin to gleam. 'Tis now the poetry of life to thee! With fancies young, and innocent as flowers, And manner sportive as the free-wing'd air, Thou seest a friend in every smile; thy days Like singing birds, in gladness speed along, And not a tear which trembles on thy lids But shines away, and sparkles into joy! Yet Time shall envy such a dream as this; And when I see thee in thine after-years, As far as Virtue from her primal height Is fallen, will thy tarnish'd nature be From that which blasts me with its pureness now. But need I travel into years unborn To gather misery? Behold it here! Here, where a childless mother by the tomb Of her dead offspring, wan and wither'd, sits In the dull stupor of despairing grief. Her brow is bent; her visage thin and worn; Her garments fading like neglected flowers, And not a glance but speaks an agony. Oh, Wretch! whose sorrow all thy virtue makes! For she who perish'd in a timeless grave Though beautiful as ever sunshine clad, In love and truth most tenderly endow'd, When living, was a curse to thee! Thy hate Pursued her, and thy blighting envy frown'd Like a dark hell-shade on her youthful path: Oft in the midnight thou wouldst mutt'ring wake And bid the grave to open on thy child. Yet when her dwelling was the loathsome tomb, And scowling Envy had no charms to dread,— When that was dust which once an Angel look'd, The mother's heart return'd again, and grief, Too late, then rack'd thy being to remorse, Making thee all which Demons could desire! For hope, nor faith, one reconciling beam Imparts, to brighten thy dark woes; unwatch'd, Unseen, thou visitest the haunt and home Of Death, and in the muteness of despair Beneath a pining yew-tree lonely sitt'st, In deep'ning anguish round a daughter's tomb. And many, sad as thee, have I beheld In my dark pilgrimage round Britain's isle. A tree by lightning blasted to the ground, And those proud branches which the seasons loved To beautify, in leafless ruin laid; A wreck upon the savage waters toss'd And darkly hinting a terrific tale; Or grey-wall'd castle, where of old were seen The banner'd triumph and baronial pomp But now the prey of melancholy winds,— For each, how oft a meditative sigh Or moral tear, awakes; yet what so sad As creedless anguish in a guilty soul, And human sorrow by no hope assuaged? “My God! it is a miserable world,” May'st thou, the wretched, cry. From faded years No flower to rescue for remembering love, Or blissful woe; the Future but a dread Unknown; the Present all a blacken'd scene; By friends unloved, or in the tomb, forgot,— How desolate thy doom must be! Abroad, The sunshine mocks thee with a cruel glare; And in the smile of each unthinking crowd No bright reflection for thy heart is found; At home—blank weariness of soul awaits Thee there, and turns it into dismal thought: Or haply, when the sallow evening shrouds Yon echoing city, at thy window placed, With vacant eye thou view'st the yielding glow Of day; or hear'st the moan of evening-bells, Like elegies by air-born spirits sung. But now a sunset, with impassion'd hues Of splendour, deepens round yon curving bay; 'Tis Inspiration's hour, when heaven descends In dream-like radiance on the earth becalm'd. Hither! thou victim of luxurious halls, The glory of these westering clouds behold That rich as eastern fancies fleat the skies Along: and hark!—the revelry of waves; Now, like the whirling of unnumber'd wheels In faint approach; then wild as battle-roar In shatter'd echoes voyaging the wind; And now, in foaming wildness they advance, Dissolve, and mark the pebbled beach with foam. Brief as a fancy, and as brightly vain, The sky-pomp fades; and in his sumptuous robe Of cloudy sheen, the great high-Priest of earth Calmly descends beyond the ocean-bound. Like weary eyelids, flowers are closing up Their beauty; faint as rain-falls sound the leaves, When ruffled by the dying breath of Day; And twilight, that true hour for placid dreams Or tender thoughts, now dimly o'er the wave Its halcyon wing unfolds; in spectral gloom The cloud-peak'd hills depart; and all the shore Is lull'd, where nothing mars its deep repose, Save when the step of yon lone wanderer moves, Watching the boats in sailless pomp reposed; Or, mournful listening to the curfew-sound Of eve-bells, hymning from their distant spires. And who art thou, of wither'd aspect there, Whose slow faint footfalls sound of misery? Consuming want thy lot hath never been: But thou art one, from out whose bygone days No memories breathe for retrospective moods To welcome; the true dignity of life Thy consecrated powers hath ne'er employ'd; Thy past is blacker than the sunless tomb; Reflection murders thy vain peace of mind!— The moonlight, paving with a glassy shore Of wrinkled lustre all yon desert-main; The night's sad umbrage and her mystic hush O'erwhelmingly becalm thee; thou wouldst fain Again be flatter'd with the gorgeous Day, And lose thy sadness in its fawning smile. So terrible a speechless hour! when Thought Banish'd by guilt, hath long an exile been From Nature, dreading down herself to gaze. In vengeance and convicting truth it comes With the dread quickness of a lightning-glance, Detecting all the danger of the soul, Till conscience tremble, and the summon'd past Is past no more!—but present, with a fire And force concenter'd for terrific sway; “I AM,” which voices God's eternity, Is heard, and fearful sounds the truth therein! But oh, how bounded would my kingdom be If what is life in common language deem'd, Which unreflectively hath flow'd away, Were all the law of Being did require! Yet is there life, where no reflection acts? Was Spirit with divinity endow'd, Blindly to live by sense alone?—How well For many, had they brute enjoyers been Of homely nature; or, as trees and flowers, Than charter'd with undying mind, to live Mere breath and blood, without a spirit train'd To pure advancement, by the hallow'd power Of truths, which up to heaven and glory lead. He lives the longest who has thought the most; And by sublime anticipation felt That what's immortal must progressive prove, Or, retrograde in everlasting night! BOOK VI. “Divided by a river, of whose banks On each side an imperial city stood, With towers and temples proudly elevate.” Paradise Regained. But, hail, thou city-Giant of the world! Thou that dost scorn a canopy of clouds, But in the dimness of eternal smoke For ever rising like an ocean-steam Dost mantle thine immensity; how vast And wide thy wonderful array of towers In dusky masses pointing to the skies! Time was, and dreary solitude was here; And night-black woods, unvisited by man, In howling conflict wrestled with the winds, But now, the tempest of perpetual life Is heard, and like a roaring furnace fills With living sound the airy reach of miles. Thou more than Rome! for never from her heart Of empire such disturbing passion roll'd, As emanates from thine. The mighty globe Is fever'd by thy name; a thousand years And Silence hath not known thee! What a weight Of awfulness will Doomsday from thy scene Derive, and when the blasting Trumpet smites All Cities to destruction, who will sink Sublime, with such a thunder-crash as thou? Myriads of spires, and temples huge or high, And thickly wedded, like the ancient trees Which darken forests with primeval gloom; Myriads of streets, whose windings ever flow With viewless billows from a sea of life; Myriads of hearts in full commotion blent, From morn to noon from noon to night again Through the wide realm of whirling passion borne,— And there is London! England's heart and soul: By the proud flowing of her famous Thames She circulates through countless lands and isles Her tides of commerce; gloriously she rules, At once the awe and sceptre of the world! Angels and Demons! to your watching eyes The rounded earth nought so tremendous shows As this vast City, in whose roar I stand, Unseen, yet seeing all. The solemn hush Of everlasting hills; the solitudes Untrod; the deep gaze of thy dazzling Orbs Which decorate the purple noon of night Oh, Nature! no such majesty supply. Creation's queen, in sceptred grandeur, Thou Upon the throne of Elements dost reign; But in the beating of one single heart There is that more than rivals thee! and here The swellings of unnumber'd hearts abound; And not a day but, ere it die, contains A hist'ry, which unroll'd, will awe the Heavens To wonder, and the listening Earth with fear! In Capitals of such gigantic sweep, And hence, involving for momentous sway Materials, which by word or deed create An impulse throbbing through th' excited world, Spirits of Darkness! how hath vice prevail'd; Though scornfully, as now your victims mock The name of Satan with triumphant sneer. Obliging creatures! did their race abhorr'd, What blighting sense we have of Virtue's power And all those living elements of love And glory, which around them move and dwell Imagine,—they would learn to guard them more. But, no! so blindly fool'd and charm'd they seem With the proud beauty of their own pure souls, That when most fetter'd, they appear most free:— How Devils laugh to see such wisdom bound! Through what a range thy blended passions reach, Thou second Babylon! The Book of Life With records that have made the angels weep, Each moment of thy fated hist'ry fills. For, whatsoe'er a spirit can reveal Of fallen nature, in its varied realm Of Sin, thy demonstrations body forth. Here, Fraud and Murder on their thrones erect Infernal standards, and around them swarm Such progenies as Vileness, Want, and Woe Beget, to live, like cannibals, on blood; Or, move as crawling vipers in the paths Of infamy, foul lewdness, or despair. Here, Misery her wildest form betrays, And sheds her hottest tear. See! as they rush Thy million sons, along yon clam'rous streets, Upon them how she turns her haggard gaze, Lifts her shrunk hand, and with heart-piercing wail A boon in God's name asks:—but let Her die, And be her death-couch those remorseless stones! For when the hungry winter blast shall pause To soothe the wailing of some lonely tree, Thy crowds will stop, and pity her despair! Here Pride, in her most vulgar glory struts; And Envy all her vip'rous offspring breeds. But Mammon! thou persuasive friend of Hell, Sure London is thy ever-royal seat, Thy chosen capital, thy matchless home! Where rank idolaters, of every lot And land, do bow them to the basest dust Which Falsehood, Flattery, or Cunning treads From dawn to eve; and serve thee with as true A love as lauding Angels serve their God! See! how the hard and greedy worldlings crowd, With toiling motion, through the foot-worn ways; The sour and sullen, wretched, rack'd and pale,— The whole vile circle of uneasy slaves. Mark one, with features of ferocious hue; Another, carved by villany's own hand, A visage wears, and through the trait'rous blood The spirit works like venom from the soul. What rush and roar unceasing! and how strange A mass of objects, as I move along Invisible, amid these floods of Life I see;—a chaos of uncounted hearts Beating and bounding, charged with great design, And making Fate at every pulse to feel, Before me acts its mighty tragedy! Amid them rise those consecrated Shrines Where ruins eloquent with history are; Where Truth is worshipp'd, and the belfry-towers Are frequent mutt'ring how the Hours depart, With unregarded wisdom; or, with moan Funereal, wailing for some vanish'd Soul. But hail, thou monument to hell!—yon pile Whose massiness a mournful shadow frowns, Where felon captives, for their crimes, await The vengeance due to violated Law. A day restored, and in thy dungeon wept A victim, whom a darker prison holds Than ever prescient horror shaped! Had Youth Beheld him, more than fun'ral sermons teach, His glance of agony had taught! How oft When gaily passing, ominously came A chill of terror from those prison-walls! And when he enter'd their sepulchral gloom Like memory that chill return'd.—To die A malefactor's death; to be the gaze, The direful, hideous, and detested gaze Of thousands, glutting their unsated eyes With morbid wonder, while on tiptoe placed To see the Spirit gasping from his throat, And chronicle his agony;—to live A ballad-hero, in the creaking rhymes Of vagabonds, and have his felon-name From lip to lip thus vilely bandied out For vulgar warning,—oh, ye sinless days Of childhood! oh, ye hours of love and home, And summer-dreams by haunted wood or wild, And blessings nightly murmur'd from the lip Of parents,—Glory of remember'd days! Is this your ending, and his ghastly fate For whom old Age did prophesy renown And Fondness built her palaces?—A sire, Who dream'd the heroic grandeur of his race In him revived, and in the youthful ear Did oft unrol his ancestry high-born, To thrill the blood and keep the spirit brave; A mother made of tenderness, who watch'd His cradle-slumber, and when manhood came Still breathed her spirit round his onward way; Oh! these would shudder in their sacred tombs, And on his name the kindless world expend The infamy which to a gallows clings, If Law should wreak her vengeance. But, one drop Of poison, and this ignominious doom Was saved!—a tremor of despair, a tide Of anguish, burning through his blood and brain, With the fierce whirling of imagined fires,— And shrunk and ghastly lay the Suicide! Huge, high, and solemn, sanctified by time, And gazing sky-ward in the tow'ry gloom Of temple-majesty, another Pile Behold! in mid-air ponderously rear'd. How dread a power pervadeth Things, this mass Of ancient glory tells. Whereon it stands The vacant winds did trifle; and the laugh Of sunshine sported in bright freedom there: It rose, and lo! there is a spirit-awe Around it dwelling; with suspended heart 'Tis enter'd; where a cold sepulchral hush, The holiness of its immensity, The heaven-like vastness of those vaulted aisles, Banners and trophies and heraldic signs, And tombs of monumental melancholy,— All with commingling spell the minds o'ercloud Of Mortals, as they walk the haunted gloom Of arch and nave, immersed in dreams of death. Methinks Ambition might grow humble here: Though, blazon'd high, the mausoleums rise, And from stain'd windows rosy light-shades fall On armory, and crests of costly hue, Funereal pride, and sculptured canopies Which grace the dust of hero, sage, or king,— The sense that rankling clay beneath such pomp Alone remains, humiliates and chills The passion for proud greatness. But Her eye More frequent to yon lonely Transept turns, Where the dead heroes of the heart repose, And on it gazeth with a deeper awe Than ever high-raised tomb of Monarchs won:— No matter! bard or king, the Curse decrees For all, re-union with their fellow-clay. Echoes on echoes roll'd and reproduced!— As though invisibly with rushing flame O'erwhelm'd, the music-haunted Temple sounds: Hark! peal on peal, and burst on burst, sublime The prelude comes, ascendeth loud and deep, And then in waves of melody departs: But ere it died, a thousand faces shone With ecstasy; as sunshine, in a sweep Of gladness over hill and meadow shot, Can summon tints of glory from the scene,— So drew the music, in its sweeping flow O'er mortal features, flashes from the soul, Bright hues and meanings, passionate as true. The heaven of Music! how it wafts and winds Itself through all the poetry of sound! Now, throbbing like a happy Thing of air, Then, dying a voluptuous death, as lost In its own lux'ry; now alive again In sweetness, wafted like a vocal cloud Mellifluously breaking—seems the strain. And what a play of magic on each face Of feeling! when the cadence dismal sounds, All eyes look darken'd with memorial-dreams; But when the Organ's deep-toned rapture swells With harmonies which stir heroic mind, Bright raptures revel in each glowing face! Till slow at length, the dying Anthem breathes A musing tone of melancholy power And pathos, causing buried years to breathe, While mem'ry saddens; and in thoughtful eyes The dewy brightness of emotion dawns. All music is the Mystery of sound, Whose soul lies sleeping in the air, till roused, And lo! it pulses into melody: Deep, low, or wild, obedient to the throb Of instrumental magic; on its wings Are visions too, of tenderness and love, Beatitude and joy. Thus, over waves Of beauty, landscapes in their loveliest glow, And the warm languish of their summer-streams, A list'ning soul is borne; while Home renews Its paradise, beneath the moon-light veil That mantles o'er the past, till unshed tears Gleam in the eye of memory. But when Some harmony of preternatural swell Begins, then, soaring on enchanted plumes, A soul seems wafted through Eternity! Such sorcery in music dwells;—if they, Now doom'd awhile to walk this heaven-roof'd world, Might hear the melodies which I have heard, When heaven, complexion'd by almightiness In glory, sounded with the choral hymn Of Princedoms high, and Dominations grand, Of thousand Saints, of thousand Cherubim, And angel-numbers, who out-million far Bright worlds, which in the blue and waveless deep Of night, innumerable hang,—if men Might hear it, 'twould absorb their souls away! Yet such I heard; oh! what a sea of sound Went billowing with ecstatical delight Through fathomless immensity, when hosts Divine, their Holy, Holy, Holy, sung, While loud Hosannahs to the living God Commingled, making heaven more heavenly glow! Another triumph of exhaustless mind, Which Love and Wisdom, Beauty and fair Truth, Tempt as I may, enchantingly produce.— Visions of holiness, and lofty dreams Of lofty Spirits, glorify the walls Of this vast room; revealings of the soul Intense, and passions of pictorial spell. Painters are silent poets; in their hues A language glows, whose words are magic tints Of meaning, which both eye and soul perceive. How wonderful is deathless Art! for Time Obeys her summons, and the Seasons wait Her godlike call; while glory, love, and grace, And the deep harmonies of human thought Move at the waving of Her mighty wand! Then let me look on this ethereal show Wherein the painter hath a mind transfused, Turning his thoughts to colours. What a thirst For beauty in his longing soul must burn Who vision'd this,—a landscape gods might tread! The sky hangs glorious; and the yellow smiles Of summer, on a brightly-wrinkled stream Are flashing with a restless joy, 'mid trees Unpruned, and bowing graceful as the wind In melody its fairy wing expands Among them: over rocks of cloudy shape The green enchantment of declining boughs Is flushing, whence a vein of water flows, And frolics on in many a shining trail Of stream-like revelry; till margin-flowers Beside it bloom, and shadow the young waves. But there, a beautiful Perfection smiles! An Eve-like form beside a dimpled lake Is standing;—in her eye, a heaven of soul, And o'er her figure an expressive bloom Of youth, and symmetry, divinely graced. The moon-like glowing of her loveliness, Those limbs of light, and that seraphic air,— Whence sprung it all, but from ideal thirst For Beauty, purer than mere Sense beholds? Here is a sunset, in that golden calm Appearing, when the lustrous King of day Awhile in bright complacence views the world Which he hath glorified,—as Wisdom look'd On infant Nature, when she lay complete Beneath the full reflection of His smile. And near, a night is pictured in its dead Of noon: the canopy of azure pomp Hung starless,—but the queen of heaven is there In placid glory, and her slumb'rous veil Hath shadow'd earth, and on blue ocean lies In rolls of silver:—by the sallow beach Two maidens in their girlhood stand, and seem Enrapt, to watch how delicately bright The moon's pale fancies tint yon fleeting waves; Or, listen to the faint sweet undersong Of dream-like waters, dying on the shore. But, what is this!—the Deluge which devour'd A living World! a sunless, moonless waste, The globe into a chaos of wild sea Dissolved! Her hour of agony is o'er; But yet, the fierceness of unnat'ral clouds, Like dying monsters welt'ring on the deep, Frowns awful in the gloom.—How dead and mute Th' enormous ruin! Not a look of life Dwells there,—the carcase of a guilty World! Woods, trees and flowers, with all which landscapes wear In spring-time's young magnificence of bloom And promise, with the god-like shapes of men, Have perish'd. By the rocky darkness, crags And mountain-skeletons by billows wash'd, The oozy branches, where lank serpents coil, And in the deadness of two pallid forms Hurl'd from the deep, and dash'd upon the shore In solitude, a mortal may be awed, And dream, until he hear the Deluge roar! But let it pass: for lo! the dark sublime, The midnight and immensity of Art I see; as though his eye had seen the hour When down in thunder through the yawning skies A whirlwind of rebellious Angels came,— The painter hath infernal pomp reveal'd. A second Milton, whose creative soul Doth shadow visions to such awful life, That men behold them with suspended breath, And grow ethereal at a gaze!—how high And earthless hath his daring spirit soar'd, To paint the hell which kindled up the skies, And wield the lightnings that his Maker hurl'd! These arts are revelations which unfold How Mind, disdainful of material bounds, In spiritual romance delights to dream; Through heavens of her creation to expand Her wings, and wanton in celestial light; As soars the lark from her low nest of dew To sing and revel in the boundless air. The fallen Myriads in whose blighted gaze A beam of ruin'd glory shines, may look With something of ambitious sympathy On this proud struggle of the soul with sense,— This warfare of the Visible with Things Of viewless Essence, yet prevailing power. A haughty captive fetter'd in his clay, Man's Nature, peering through her prison-house, Doth catch a shadow, and a dim advance Of Something purer, brighter, yet to be. And what is genius?—but the glowing mind Half disembodied, flutt'ring in a realm Of magic, dreaming, dazzled, and inspired? How dark a contrast hath a moment made In this world's promise!—here, the shame of Art Confronts me; and, might Pity deaden Hate, My love for ruin should be lessen'd now.— In a lone chamber, on a tatter'd couch A dying Painter lies. His brow seems young And noble; lines of beauty on his face Yet linger; in his eye of passion gleams A soul, and on his cheek a spirit-light Is playing, with that proud sublimity Of thought, which yields to death, but gives to time A Fame that will avenge his wrongs, and write Their hist'ry in her canonizèd roll Of martyrs: be it for his epitaph, He lived for genius, and for genius died! So sad and lone! wall'd in by misery, With none to smooth his couch, or shed the tear Which softens pain, uncheer'd, unwept, unknown, And famish'd by the want of many days,— Hither, Ambition! wisdom breathes in woe. There are, to whom Earth's elemental Frame Of wonders seemeth but an outward show To look upon, and form the life of things: But some in more ethereal mould are cast, Who from the imagery of nature cull Fair meanings, and magnificent delights, Extracting glory from whate'er they view; Calling the common air a blessing, light A joy, and hues and harmonies of earth Enchanting ministers to sense and soul. And such was he. An orphan of the woods, With Nature in her ancientness of gloom And cavern, dark-peak'd hill, and craggy wild Whose boughs waved midnight in the eye of Day,— He dwelt; until he hung the wizard sky With fancies, and with nature one became By deep communion with her scenes and sounds. With all her moods, majestic, calm, or wild, He sympathised. In glory did he hear Ecstatic thunders antheming the storm! And when the winds fled by him, he would take Their dauntless wings, and travel in their roar! He worshipp'd the great Sea;—when rocking wild, Making the waters blossom into foam With her loud wrath; or savagely reposed Like a dark monster dreaming in his lair. No wonder, then, by Nature thus sublimed, With all her forms and features at his soul, The brain should teem with visions, and his hand A glorious mimicry of earth and heaven Perform! till lakes and clouds, and famish'd woods In wintry loneness, crags and eagle-haunts, And torrents in their mountain-rapture seen, All dread, all high, all melancholy Things,— Full on his canvas started into life And look'd creation! To the Capital A parentless and unacquainted youth He came, while many a prophecy still hung About his heart, and made his bosom heave With young expectancy. Romantic fool! To fancy genius and success were twins In such a sphere: how soon the dream was o'er! Here Envy dogg'd him; Avarice trampled down His worth, and in the gloom of aidless want His spirit bow'd,—but never was enslaved. There was that haughtiness of calm despair, That forward looking to avenging years Which plucks the thorn from present woe, and charms Adversity from out her darkest mood, To cheer him on, and buoy the spirit o'er The indirection of opinion's tide. He felt, as all the mighty ever feel, True Greatness must o'erlook the living hour And charge the Future with its fame alone! Thus cherish'd he self-rev'rence; and the heart Was faithful: from the hand or voice of men No comfort came; but Nature was his own As ever! When the jarring city-roar Woke round him, he could hush it in the calm Of memory, and natural solitude Of pensive scenes: the dying thunder-tones O'er his dark chamber mutter'd, bade him dream Of deeper grandeur which pervaded night Afar; and when a pilgrim sunset-ray Came to his window, like a smile from Home, He scorn'd the present, and would think, how once He loved to watch the bright farewell of Day Reflected o'er the roll of ocean-waves, Like sea-clouds rising in a gorgeous swell:— Thus lived the victim of an Art adored, And perish'd in his passion!—On his name A veil is hung, and his achievements lie Forgotten; but a fame awaits them still! Eternity will take a hue from time, And life a shade of the immortal doom Hereafter is. But even this false world Shall round his honour'd tomb a death-wreath hang, And on the eyelids of an Age unborn Shall tears be trembling when his woes are read.— Thus Merit starves, while pamper'd Folly struts In mean presumption, with a golden lot Endow'd, and smiled upon by vassal-eyes Which hunt for favour. But the lofty Hearts, Th' unbending pure, within whose natures lodge All feelings that ennoble man and mind, Are they by kingly fortune crown'd? Does Worth Or Wisdom glorious exaltation win? Look round the world, and answer! 'Tis the base, The sly, insinuating, serpent-souls Who wind about the meanest of mankind; 'Tis they, with lying blandness on the lip, Whose tuneful flattery, that cloyless sweet! Allays the gusty tempers of the proud To fond subjection, and the vain enchant To patrons blind, yet most benevolent, Yes! these are they who glitter with the crown Of fortune, sit upon the World's high thrones; And on the toiling majesty of Worth Beneath, look down, and laugh at virtuous Woe. But there are other miracles of mind In this Queen-city; whatsoe'er the Hand Can shape, or pregnant Thought conceive; whate'er Applying Art can from the soul translate To sense or vision, for the World's free gaze, Is here produced. Thus, London is a sun Of inspiration to the parent-isle; Within the circle of a minute act Uncounted minds, of multiplying power To times and generations.—But a trace Of Me, humanity! thou dost not lose, However lofty thy victorious march; For in this region of the learn'd and wise, The pettiness and pride of nature dwell. Then what is Genius, with a heart unsound? One noble action doth outweigh it all With more than priceless value. Meek and pure, Who lives in humble earnestness, partakes His lot with cheerful eye, and loving heart, And sees a Brotherhood in all mankind; Whose Teachers are the Elements, whose lore, A Bible on the soul impress'd,—that man, Howe'er undignified his earthly doom Appear, is far more glorious in the eye Of Angels, than the spirit-ruling host Of learning, who have never learnt the way To virtue, and the heart's true nobleness.— But this I would not that the earth believed; Corruption is the rankling seed I sow, And aye abundant may the harvest bloom! That mighty lever which has moved the world, The Press of England, from its dreadless source Of living action, here begins to shake The far-off Isles, and awe the utmost Globe! The magic of its might no tongue can tell! Dark, deep, and silent oft, but ever felt; Mix'd with the mind, and feeding with a food Of thought, the moral being of a Soul. A trackless Agent, a terrific Power, It could have half annihilated Hell And her great Denizens, by glorious sway: But oft, so false, so abject, and so foul It grows,—no blasting pestilence e'er shed Such ruin, as a tainted Press contrives For thought and feeling, when its poison works: This wrecks the body,—that can havoc souls; And who shall heal them? Let thy Temples rise, Britannia! they are but satiric piles Of sanctity, while poison from thy Press Is pour'd, and on its lying magic live Thy thousand vulgar, who heart-famish'd seem, When Slander feeds not with a foul excess Their appetite for infamy. The sun Not surer where his deadly rage extends The fierceness of a burning nature proves, Than pages of pollution, sent from hour To hour, across an Empire's heart, awake A tinge of sentiment and hue of thought In many, till they act the crimes they read. E'en now mine eye a dismal wretch beholds By fate or fortune for a villain doom'd; In whom is center'd all which can profane The name of Man! ignoble as the dust, And rocky-hearted as a wretch can be: And him with what delight a Devil views Heap lie on lie with such remorseless speed, And so envenom with his viper-touch The good and glorious, that all Virtue seems To wither, and all Wisdom to be dead Awhile, beneath the blackness of his taint! Yea! such a Monster do I see destroy The healthful nature of the noblest mind: And yet live on his execrable life, And like a plague-spot spread his soul abroad Till millions turn as tainted as his own! How false, and yet how fair, are scenes of man! Between what is, and that which seems to be, How dark a gap of untold diff'rence frowns! There is a hollowness in human things Of pride or pleasure born, which none confess Yet all must ever feel. The moments tuned To highest happiness, have strings which jar Upon some inward sense; the sweetest cup Enchanted Ecstasy can drink, will leave A humbling dreg of bitterness behind. But this sad vict'ry of unrestful thought, This cloud-tint on the brightest firmament Of Joy, this deep abyss of discontent Beyond a universe to fill!—though felt Is rarely own'd; for Pride steps in, and puts A smile upon the cheek, and in the eye Delusion; making Love, or Wealth, or Fame The seeming aspect of Perfection wear; And thus, deceiving each, and each deceived, Men gild the hour, and call it happiness! A proof is here: a chamber long and large, Of regal air, and with o'erbranching lights, From the high ceiling pouring down a noon Of lustre, which doth goldenly bedeck The costliness around. Amid it, group'd For converse, meet a host of either sex; And who are they?—the race Ambition bred, And madden'd, till they won the envied wreath. Oh! what a demon-fire, what parching heat Through blood and spirit, is the lust of Fame! No tiger-passion tearing at the soul, So dreadful as the ever-gnawing wish For reputation! How it burns the heart Away, and blisters up the health of life! Yet, such have many in this blended host Endured; but now, as high and dominant As Potentates and intellectual Lords They reign upon their thrones of Mind, and live The worshipp'd of the Land. But are they blest With that deep fulness of supreme delight Which young Imagination's eye portray'd? Oh, Thou! bewilder'd with the mock of fame, Come here, and prove what rottenness of heart, What fev'rous envy, what corrosive sense Of emulation, in these glorious dwell, What under-currents in this scene of joy! Smiles in the surface, but a coward-tide Of jealousy beneath. Hark to the gibe O Hate! the tart dissent, the damning sneer; To such a littleness the mighty fall! Behold it, Ignorance! thy blush recall, And take a happier name. But what a feast Of vengeance doth my gloomy nature find In this false scene, where they whom Wisdom crowns, And Praise exalts, whose spirits are abroad In this great world, and so angelic seem, Beneath the shadow of Almighty wings The simple think they mused sublime!—betray The more than weakness of unworthy man, When nature's venom quickens at the heart, Or stern reality some feeling tries. And thou! just gilded with a public smile, Thy mind is dancing on a sea of thoughts Which revel onward with delirious joy: For now, the hackney'd wonder of the Night Thou art, and by the music of fair tongues Enchanted; flatt'rers feed thine ears with praise, And clog it into deafness. Hear'st thou not How Envy whispers off thy bloom of fame, Till Meanness in false robe arrayeth thee! Thou fool of flatt'ry! this the glorious doom Ambition sought! Is Greatness only great, When flatter'd, known, and seen? Canst thou so bend, And be thus derogate? Wilt thou, whose eye The stars can read, with heaven and earth commune, Who feel'st the fibres of Creation's heart In trembling harmony with thine, descend To lose thy loftiness in this dull scene? Back to thy haunts! the Ocean and the Winds Attend thee; Nature is thy temple; kneel, And worship in her mighty solitude. Look up! and learn a lesson of the Sun, That bright Enchanter of the moving heavens! Lonely and lofty in his orb sublime, But acting ever;—such is noble fame. Some gracious, grand, and most accomplish'd few, Each with a little kingdom in his brain, Who club together to recast the world And love so many that they care for none,— These have I witness'd, laughing at their realms, Of airy texture, by ambition wove. But here is madness, far outfooling this! For lo! the den whence Oracles proceed Like exhalations from the noisome earth That, once inbreathed, are death! This wonderful Perfection of the vile, surpasseth all Temptation, in my darkest mood, employs! Yes, here are Spirits, such as hell-thrones grace, Convened to disinherit God of souls, And on the blasphemous attempt of pride Erect a dynasty of Sense supreme; Each man a god unto himself, let loose In all the blinding wantonness of will. And this is “freedom,” dignified for Man! When, having fed the agonies of life By years of being, weary, worn, and sad, To close existence in the clay he treads, A soulless, dreamless, unimagined Nought? Where sleep the thunders of convicting Wrath? Devils believe, and tremble; men deny And laugh! How enviably endow'd they are! We bow'd and blasted by opposeless heaven, Abhor the Godhead, but his name confess; But things of earth, infatuated, vile, Too darken'd to dissect a flower, or tell The meaning of an atom which they tread, Would dare annihilate the living God Above, and mock the pangs of Hell below! Oh! all, and more than Satan could desire, Blind Teachers of the blind! could this world dare To wallow in the darkness that ye breed, To such, the heathen would be heavenly-wise; For they, by revelation unillumed, Soar'd out of sense, and in the Skies their gods Enthroned, or heard them on the haunted Deep, Or in the howling of the homeless Winds. A cloud was on them; but a Spark within Yet lived, and saved them from eclipse of soul. For admiration must be felt, while Power Existeth; on it man will gaze, and learn The vast dependence for his lot ordain'd; Dread Shadows of an omnipresent One Move round him; in the march of Elements His steps are traced, and Truth is ever by, To tread them deep, and track them on to God. And hence, these murd'rers of the soul are weak In process; too infernal is the Creed They fashion; far too poor in its exchange For that divineness of redeeming Love They combat; since with freedom they are free,— As billows toss'd upon the giant main, As feathers on the travell'd whirlwind borne Are free!—No, rather some corruptive arts Of saintly mixture; or the glozing tongue Of hypocrites, with innovating clouds Of doctrine—would I at their work behold, Than the rash vileness of blaspheming fools. A few they poison, but re-action wakes! For one they ruin, thousands are sublimed To holy vengeance, which to hell may prove, Excess of evil is the source of good. But lo! again the calm-eyed Evening comes: The heavens are flaming with a rosy sea Of splendour, richly-deep; and, floating on, It reddens round the dying sun, who glares With fierce redundancy awhile, then sinks Away, like glory from Ambition's eye. Behind him, many a dream of old Romance Will cry, “What rocks, and hills, and waves of light! Magnificent confusion! such as beam'd When the rash boy-god charioted the skies And made a burning chaos of the clouds!” But this hath ended: and a breathless calm, As though eternity were closing round The World, to let it faint in light away, Creeps o'er the earth, like slumber shed on air. And well, lone pilgrim, at the shaded hour Of twilight, when a golden stillness reigns, Like lustre from a far-off angel-host Reflected, and the unoffending breeze Hath music which the day-wind seldom brings, May sadness oversteal thee; and thy heart Unspeakably with yearning fancies glow. Of life, a living Vision; and the hour Which ends it, like a cloudy dream of Air That vanisheth to some allotted world; Of faded youth, and unforgotten friends Whose tombstones over life a shadow fling No sunshine can efface; of all which makes The lone Heart wander to a dream-like home Of sadness, mortal! thou didst ponder now. Such will not ever be: thy death-gloom pierced, And awful on the unimprison'd soul A sun-burst of revealing Truth will blaze! Wherein these mysteries of sight and sense Shall all unravell'd lie.—The tender night With tragic darkness robed; the lone sweet star, Oft worshipp'd for a beatific Orb Where bright Immortals dwell; the moon's romance; The sun's enchantment, when He wakes to smile The day abroad, or preach departing life By his deep setting; with the spirit-tone Of winds, the Ocean's ever-mutt'ring waves, And all which thus predominantly awes Or saddens feeling, shall itself resolve In spiritual completion. Then, thy tear Ecstatic, radiant with adoring thought; Each thrill of rapture, like a viewless chain From heaven let down and link'd around the soul,— Shall be translated by unbodied Mind. Meanwhile, be mine to veil thee with a show Of outward Things; and sensualise the will, Whose promptings, more than conscience, men obey. Now hath dead Midnight hush'd the world: it lies Suffused with freshness, like a meadow steep'd In verdant quiet, when the flood hath pass'd. All deeply pure, impalpably divine A Something o'er this hour prevails, which men Call Awe, which doth not in their day-life reign; For then, a flush'd existence, and a false Enchantment gathers round the rising Hours To hue their destiny. But Midnight cools The spirit into thinking calm; then sounds Come o'er it with a deeper thrill; and scenes Which in the day a common gladness wore, Grow solemn; then the airy leaf-notes mourn: And boughs, like hearse-plumes, wave their shadowy pomp. By day the present, but at night the past Prevails; a moonlight-tenderness o'er things Departed, flings a fond and dream-like gloom; And then, Life takes a feeling from the soul, And in earth's tints of paradise can trace A beauty which unkinder hours deny;— The harp is shatter'd, but the sounds remain! Yet, 'tis not that the tenderness of tears Awakes; that Childhood smiles upon the thought As looks an Angel through the veil of dreams; It is not that the heart-remember'd rise From early tombs, to be once more beloved And featured, till the deadness of the dead In men'ry's vision-life is half forgot: `Tis not such charm alone; nor that which frowns From Temple, sky, or everlasting Hill Which darkness hath enrobed. But that deep sense Which he who pierces through the lonesome air Far o'er the mute immeasurable sky Where travel worlds, for adoration feels, Making the midnight holy! Silent Orbs! On me no mystic awfulness ye shed; For when unblasted, I beheld ye rise And glitter into being, bright and pure, Like radiant echoes of Almighty will! But mortals, dimly aided by their dreams, Behold ye, nursing the unutter'd thought, With pond'ring hope and apprehensive awe. They wonder, if the unearth'd Spirit dwells Among ye! where the seraph-mansions blaze, And who amid them are the bright and blest! And is there not a spirit-World? The blind May question, and the mocking idiot laugh; But in her, round her, wheresoe'er she move, Mortality might reap immortal faith, And feel what cannot in the flesh be known. In the wild Mystery of earth and air, Sun, moon, and star, and the unslumb'ring sea, Science might learn far more than Sense adores, And by thy panting for the unattain'd On earth; by longings which no language speak; By the dread torture of o'ermastering Doubt; By thirst for Beauty, such as eye ne'er saw And yet is ever mirror'd on the mind; By Love, in her rich heavenliness array'd; By Guilt and Conscience, that terrific Pair Who make the Dead to mutter from their tombs Or colour Nature with the hues of hell! By all the fire and frenzy of a soul Guilty with crime, or agonised by dread, And by that voice where God the Speaker is,— Thy doom, oh mortal! whatsoe'er thy wish In the black deep of thine unfathom'd heart, Is deathless, as the damnèd Angels are! Now is mine hour, the hour of conflict, come, When the dark Future over nature frowns Like destiny; now spirit is itself Again, and Thought, within her cell retired, Doth hold dim converse with Eternal Things. Many are musing now! and sighs are born, In slow succession, like unwilling tears Prophetic and profound. The worldling sees In darkness, what the day could not reveal,— Himself! and sorrows at the faithful view. “Another day eternal made! O Time And Destiny, how swift ye roll the world Along, to which such eager myriads cling In duty, fondness, or despair! Alas! Too much we make, yet far too little think Of time: but, oh, at this untroubled hour How awfully mine inward visions rise! Infinity is round me; and I feel A dampness on my spirit, and a dark Unearthliness of thought; the dead awake, Unlock their tombs, and tell me I must die!” What sadness here! and what a wounded soul; And yet the World shall his physician be! But, hark! the moaning voice of deep-tongued bells Herald the midnight o'er the drowsy world. Now Earth is one day older; time itself More awful, and the dead to Hades gone. Earth, Heaven, and Hell, have felt this fleeted day, That now is chronicled for Judgment! Morn Hath look'd on many with her radiant eye Whose brows shall never meet Her beam again! Another Sun, another System works Around them; they who dwelt in distant climes, And diff'rent aspect wore, the friend and foe, The loveless and the loving, all who once Through time, or circumstance, estranged and far Existed,—now are met where nothing more Is alien, but one Darkness, or one Light, As vice or virtue doom'd them. Oh! ye sad And discontented, weary, worn, and grey; Thou martyr of the melancholy hour Loving the silence for the dream it gave, Sick of the world, and sighing for a tomb; And ye, on whom this Life a burden lay, Yet often loosed it when the dying bell Of Midnight, like a warning from the grave Went in its sadness through the soul,—your gaze Doth witness what your nature never dreamt; The Veil is torn, the Mystery unseal'd, And ye are men no more! Methinks a Voice From many, would revisit this far world! But no:—the Dust is faithful to its dead, And they are silent, till the Trumpet speak! And now, my wand'rings dark though this free Isle Are o'er; through town and village, house and street, By virtue of my being, have I roam'd, A sightless Presence, an unshadow'd Power, An undream'd Watcher moving round the hearts Of men, and looking into depths of soul Where none but Hell, and the Immortals gaze. The sights which none have seen; the voices none Have heard, with all the agony and glow, The longings, workings, and unrestful strife Of passion, mingled in the sleepless mind, And fever'd into what a life is named,— These have I witness'd; and on what thou art, And wert, and might'st have been, heaven-favour'd Land! Reflected, weighing thee for future worlds.— For future worlds! each day and hour, thy dead Are there; each moment is a Hell or Heaven To many of thy dust. Thou bear'st the awe Of Destiny; as on the earth thy power Hath stamp'd its mightiness on every realm, Printing the roll of Time with many a track Of gloom and glory, havoc or renown, So, when the Universe is roll'd away Beneath the shadow of Almighty frown, Eternity shall chronicle thy name For wonder; it will be a sign in heaven! Then speed thee onward in thy vaunting course Of empire; let no dream of Judgment shade Thy soul, or touch thee with a solemn fear: Plunge in the future! let the past be dead To thee; for when shall England's sceptre fail? Thus dare, and do, and perish in thy dream! Ye buried Empires, which have braved the world, Rise from your tombs, and speak! for once I mark'd Your palmy greatness; sea-famed Tyre I saw When ocean cower'd beneath her vassal-ships; And hoar Chaldea's hundred-gated Queen In high-wall'd glory! Tell me, what are they? And she, earth's ancient tyranness, vast Rome, The rolling of her battle-cars, the voice Of Scipio, and the sound of Cæsar's march, Did I not hear, when Kingdoms were her slaves? And thou, the fairy-isled, forsaken Greece! When Sage and Bard, and battle-wreaths, were thine, When all which centuries glorified could yield Was consecrated to thy vast renown, I walk'd thy streets, and prophesied thy doom! Thus fell the mighty;—shall not Britain fall? But lo! the heavens are ominously black, Methinks, as though they frown'd a dark response. Erewhile, and star-troops in their island-glow Around the wan Enchantress of the skies Appear'd, while lovingly the azure lay Between them, softer than the lid of sleep. But now, all pregnant with portentous ire, The clouds have muffled up the pomp of night: There is a gasping in the heated air, A wing-like flutter in the tim'rous boughs, And sigh, and sound, from out the heart of Things Invisible, breathed forth; the Storm awakes! And tones of thunder thrill the heart of Earth; The lightnings cleave the clouds, and north to south, And east to west, a tale of Darkness tell! Hark! as the wearied echoes howl themselves Away, the clamours of the midnight-sea, Beneath yon cliff in thund'ring chorus rise, While she is waved with terror! billows heave Their blackness in the wind, and, bounding on In vaulting madness, beat the rocky shore Incessant, till it whitens with their foam. I love this passion of the Elements, This mimicry of chaos, in their might Of storm! And here, in my lone awfulness While ev'ry cloud a thunder-hymn repeats, Earth throbs, and Nature in convulsion reels, Farewell to England! Into other climes My flight I wing, but round her cast that spell I weave for Nations till their doom arrive. And come it shall! When on this guardian-cliff Again I stand, the whirlwind and the wrath Of Desolation will have swept all thrones Away; a darkness, as of old, will reign, The woods be standing where yon cities tower, And Ocean wailing for a widow'd Isle! OXFORD: OR, Alma Mater. (1830.) TO THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS, AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, This Poem IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED, BY THEIR OBEDIENT SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. PART I.

Round the vast miracles achieved by Mind Throng the deep raptures of entranced mankind: For what though Empires spread their proud control Far as the winds exult or waters roll; Though Tyrian merchandise their ports bedeck And navies thunder at their awful beck, The pride of Commerce and the awe of Power Melt into dreams, at desolation's hour: Then, what remains of Kingdoms which have been? Lo! deserts wave, where Capitals were seen! The wild grass quivers o'er each mangled Pile, And winter moans along the archless aisle; Where once they flourished ruins grimly tell, And shade the air with melancholy spell, While from their wreck a tide of feeling rolls In awful wisdom through reflective souls. What then alone majestically reigns When Empires grovel on deserted plains, In morning lustre to illume the night Which Time engenders o'er their vanish'd might? 'Tis Mind! an immortality below That gilds the past and bids the future glow; 'Tis mind!—heroic, pure, devoted Mind To God appealing for corrupt mankind, Reflecting back the image that He gave Ere sin began, or Earth became a slave! If then from soaring intellect arise Perennial triumphs, England's heart may prize, In towery dimness, gothic, stern, or grand, Behold her palaces of Learning stand! When Day was dying into sunset glow I first beheld them in their beauteous show, The solemn turrets of each ancient pile, And thought—How noble is our native Isle! A silent worship o'er my spirit came, While feelings far too exquisite for name Exultingly began their rapt control, And fluttered, like faint music, in the soul. Where Greatness trod, is hallow'd ground to me; There can I lift the heart, and bow the knee, The past awake to all its living might, And charm my fancy with unearthly sight, Restore the features of the famous dead, Nor take a Kingdom for the tear I shed! And how poetic is that haunted Spot Where life is mental, and the world forgot! A spirit wafted from collegiate bowers And the dim shadow of her ancient towers To Alma Mater holy calm impart, And make her scene harmonious with the heart. The very air seems eloquently fraught With the deep fulness of devoted thought; While all around her, famed as eye desires, Each mind ennobles or some heart inspires. And here, how many a youthful Soul began To sketch the drama of the future man; How many an Eye o'er coming years hath smiled, And sparkled, as incessant hope beguiled! The star-like spirits, whose enduring light Beams on the World, and turns its darkness bright, In radiant promise here began to rise, And glow ambitious for eternal Skies. Oh! none whose souls have felt a mighty name Thrill to their centre with its sound of fame; Whose hearts have warm'd at wisdom, truth, or worth, And half which makes the heaven we meet on earth, Can tread the ground by Genius often trod, Nor feel a nature more akin to God! Here in their blended magic float along Pindaric rapture and Virgilian song; Still Homer charms as when he first prevail'd And honour'd Greece her idol poet hail'd; See Athens in her classic bloom revive, Her sages worshipp'd, and her bards alive; See Rome triumphant, with her banner furl'd, Awaken genius to enchant a world! There are, who see no intellectual rays Flash from the spirit-light of other Days; Who deem no Age transcendent as their own, And high the Present o'er the Past enthrone. Yet, not in vain the world hath aye adored The treasured wisdom ages gone afford; Or loved the freshness of that youthful Time When Science woke, and Man became sublime! For then, the Elements of mind were new, And Fancy from their unworn magic drew; Creation's self was one unrifled theme To form the Poet, and enchant his dream: As yet unhaunted by inquiring thought, Each track of mind with mental bloom was fraught; The first in nature were the first to feel Impassion'd wonder and romantic zeal; Hence matchless vigour nerved their living page, That won the worship of a future age;— From ancient Lore see modern Learning rise, The last we honour, but the first we prize. Then long enshrined in this august retreat May Greece and Rome for high communion meet; Long may their forceful page and free-born style From year to year enamour'd Youth beguile; The Judgment form, uncertain Taste direct, Teach Truth to feel, and Fancy to reflect; And Learning, hallow'd by immortal fame, See England glory in her Oxford name! Yet not forsaken be the proud career Which circles through the realm of Thought severe; The studies vast which measure earth and sky, Or open worlds on the undaunted eye: Which more offends,—the bigot who can read No volume from the dust of Ages freed; Or he who owns no intellectual grace, But makes a cargo of the human race, And values man like produce from the ground,— 'Tis hard to say, yet both, alas! are found. The dark idolater of ancient Time, And solemn Epicure in prose or rhyme, The groping Pedant with a gloomy eye, Who whines an elegy o'er days gone by,— Oh! still from Oxford be such race removed, And nobler far her gifted scions proved. What soul so vacant, so profoundly dull, What brain so wither'd in a barren skull, As his who, dungeon'd in the gloom of Eld, From all the light of living mind withheld, Can deem it half an intellectual shame To glow at Milton's worth, or Shakspere's name! Farewell to Bigots! whatso'er their hue, Who darken Learning, and disgrace it too; Another charge let Alma Mater own By frequent Sages on her wisdom thrown: Alike one Standard for the great and small Her Laws decree, by which she judges all; Hence in one mould must oft confound at once The daring thinker with the plodding dunce; The soaring Mind must sink into a plan, Forget her wings, and crawl where Dulness can; Those bolder traits, original and bright, Fade into dimness when they lose the light Of open, free, and self-created day Where all the tints of Character can play. Yet, what could Education's art provide For countless Minds by varying standard tried? For public Weal, not individual Mind As mental Nurse was Oxford first design'd; And blindly wrong would be her guardian eye, To love the great, but pass the lesser by; From each due toil impassion'd Genius save, And crown for merit what mere Nature gave. Not all alike discerning Heaven endows, Nor equal mind to equal heart allows: Full oft th' ingenuous pang, the noble tear Or modest Doubt, the phantom-child of fear, To humble Worth a consecration lends, Which proves for lost renown sublime amends;— Let mind be nursed, though doom'd a narrow sphere, And what his Maker gives, let man revere! Allow that Genius feels a curbless soul, Which chafes in fetters, and defies control; And, haughty as the mountain eagle-chain'd, Hath every empire but her own disdain'd: Though customs old, like ancient roots, are found With stubborn grasp to cling to native ground, Fain would her boldness to Herself be rule, And energy its own majestic school! But when hath Mind such education lost, However cabin'd, and however cross'd? Alike triumphant over college-wall, The mouldy cellar, and plebeian stall We mark the Soul of Inspiration rise, Expand her wings, and revel in the skies! It was in prison that Boëthius composed his excellent work on the “Consolations of Philosophy;” it was in prison that Goldsmith wrote his “Vicar of Wakefield;” it was in prison that Cervantes wrote “Don Quixote,” which laughed chivalry out of Europe; it was in prison that Charles I. composed that excellent work, the “Portraiture of a Christian King;” it was in prison that Grotius wrote his “Commentary on St. Matthew;” it was in prison that Buchanan composed his excellent “Paraphrase on the Psalms of David;” it was in prison that Daniel De Foe wrote his “Robinson Crusoe;” (he offered it to a bookseller for ten pounds, which that liberal encourager of literature declined giving); it was in prison that Sir W. Raleigh wrote his “History of the World;” it was in prison that Voltaire sketched the plan and composed most of the poem of “The Henriade;” it was in prison that Howel wrote most of his “Familiar Letters;” it was in prison that Elizabeth of England and her victim, Mary Queen of Scots, wrote their best poems; it was in prison that Margaret of France (wife of Henry IV.) wrote an “Apology for the Irregularities of her Conduct;” it was in prison that Sir John Pettas wrote the book on metals, called “Fleta Minor;” it was in prison that Tasso wrote some of his most affecting poems. With the fear of a prison how many works have been written! Then vainly let the powerless sophist frown, To hide one ray of Oxford's fair renown: Or quote some verse to vindicate his cause, Of scornful meaning at her ancient Laws. Spirits have lived, who could not suffer chains; The fire which fever'd their electric veins Burn'd all too restless for obedient thought, And hence the solace indignation brought. Yet when was Order known, or due Control, To quench divinity within the soul? Oh! little think they, how sublimely pure, In godlike state above the World secure, That earthless nature which they Genius call! In vain the tides of circumstance appal; Though clouds repress, and darksome woe detain, The Soul remounts, and is Herself again. Go, ask of Ages what made dungeons bright, Vile Sufferance sweet, and Danger a delight?— 'Twas Spirit, independent as sublime, The King of nature and the Lord of time! The Sun is up! behold a genial day, And all things glorious in its glorious ray; Ascend the Radcliffe's darkly-winding coil Of countless steps, nor murmur at the toil; For lo! a Scene, when that ascension's o'er, Which Painters love, when most their feelings soar. There, from the base of her commanding Dome O'er many a mile the spell-bound glance may roam, While music-wing'd, the winds of freshness sound, Like airy haunters of the region round. Yon heavens are azured by one cloudless die; Beneath—romance in stone to charm the eye! Spire, tower, and steeple, roofs of radiant tile, The costly Temple, and collegiate Pile, In sumptuous mass of mingled form and hue, Await the wonder of thy lingering view. Far to the west, autumnal meadows wind Whose fading tints fall tender on the mind; And near, a hoary Tower with dial'd side, And nearer still, in many-window'd pride, All Souls', with central towers superbly grand; But see! the clouds are rent,—they break,—expand, And sunshine, welcomed by each ancient pile, Like Past and Present when they meet to smile, With tinting magic beautifully falls On fretted pinnacles, and fresco'd walls, Till dark St. Mary, with symmetric spire, Swells into glory as her shades retire; And Maudlin' trees, which wave o'er Cherwell-stream, Flash on the view and flutter in the beam: In yellow faintness, lo! that sun-burst dies, The vision changes with the change of skies; Again have Centuries their dominion won, And shadows triumph o'er the failing Sun. And every where time-hallow'd Temples rise, Whose classic pomp corroding age defies. What solemn beauty by the spirit felt! While feelings into adoration melt, As in their depth of Gothic gloom we tread Amid the hush of Ages which are dead. I well remember, when a stranger, first, What stately Vision on my senses burst! From towering lamps a noon-like radiance shone O'er pavement mottled with mosaic stone, And white-robed Choristers in due array, Whose vestments glitter'd like the sheen of day. There, silver-voiced, in many a heav'nward note, I heard rich Music in soft billows float, Now faintly ebb, then loudly swell again, And grow resistless as the organ-strain Came river-like, in one impassion'd roll From the deep harmony of Handel's soul! And tell me, thou whose wandering feet have trod Like his who trembled on the ground of God, The hallow'd soil where classic glories shine Back on thy spirit with their beam divine, Hath Oxford, haunted by her long array Of Memories which cannot glide away, No local Magic to entrance thy mind, And make it prouder of thy Human Kind? Whate'er of good and glorious, learn'd or grand, Delighted ages and adorn'd the land, Was foster'd here:—the Senate, Pulpit, Bar, The scenes of Ocean, and the storms of War, Wherever Mind hath high dominion shown To counsel Kingdoms, or secure a Throne,— There may Oxonia sons of glory hail, And see the Spirit which she nursed, prevail! Forget awhile the fever of the hour, And give the Past its resurrection-power; Around thee Bards and Sages muse or stray, And wind the garden that is walk'd to-day. The pilgrim-clouds, those time-worn trees which wave On banks whose beauty constant waters lave, Their eyes beheld:—do burning thoughts begin? Then dare to rival what you dream within! Too vast Her list, might pen achieve it all, Each form of memory into life to call; Yet fain would fondness with some imaged few Partake a moment, and believe it true. Adown yon path, beside the grassy sweep Of Maudlin' park, where light deer couch and leap, And giant elms the haughty Winds delay, There gentle Addison was wont to stray: And where the mill-stream turns yon restless wheel, As writhing on those broken waters steal, His tree-lined walk of beauteous length began, For ever hallow'd by that holy man! In many a whirl hath Autumn's driving blast From these fond trees their summer-foliage cast, And leafy showers now mournfully abound, In sallow redness scatter'd o'er the ground; But here, full oft, the branches waving green, And heaven's blue magic smiling in between, The pensive Rambler dream'd an hour away, Or wove the music of his Attic lay; Saw Cato's grandeur on his soul arise, And Heaven half open to a heathen's eyes: Or, happier themes, whose ethic pureness glows With every tint that character bestows, From ancient Lore his tender heart beguiled, And lit his features when his fancy smiled, Nor be forgot, who all his worth could feel, The friend of Addison, delightful Steele! Whose classic morn let Merton's annals claim, Where first the Drama woo'd him on to fame: More roughly hewn than his Athenian friend, And venturing oft where Virtues never tend; Yet warm of soul, and child-like to a tear, As when it dropp'd on Love's parental bier; Now madly sunk in passion's deep excess, Now high in wisdom which a saint might bless! A mixture wild of all that man admires, Whose faults may warn him, while his fame inspires. Ere Steele began, what Addison pursued, The path still trod with mental gratitude, Those day-born graces, whose refinement blends The charm of Manner with the soul of friends, La Casa first in Italy awoke, And sketch'd the Courtier with a master-stroke. But next, a Gallic Theophrastus threw His playful archness o'er the scene he drew, Dissected truth with Satire's keenest knife, And mirror'd Nature on the glass of life. Then rose on English ground the gifted pair, Who taught to either Sex a softer air, Proved Elegance to Virtue's self allied, And laugh'd at Dulness, till her follies died! O'er weeds and thorns which social life beset, And tease their martyr into vain regret, Their morning-smile satirically pass'd, Till fools turn'd wise, and fops were cured at last! Nor small the debt Society should pay To him who flaps her buzzing Flies away; Those noisesome Insects on eternal wing, That hum at banquets, or in ball-rooms sting, Which, though they cannot heart and mind o'erpower, May fret the smoothness of the calmest hour. Here Collins, too, whose perfect numbers roll Pathetic music o'er the dreaming soul, In melancholy loneness pined and thought 'Mid the sad gloom by stricken genius wrought. E'en now the curse was breeding in his brain,— A nerveless spirit, and a soul insane; While moon-born fairies would around him throng, And genii haunt him in the hush of song: Ill-fated bard! like Chatterton's thy doom, To seek for fame, and find it in the tomb! To Pembroke turn, and what undying charm, Breathed from the Past, shall there thy spirit warm? There Johnson dwelt! the dignified and sage, The noblest Honour of a noble age; Whose mien and manners, though of graceless kind, Were all apart from his heroic mind; They were the bark around some royal tree Whose branches towering in the heavens we see. Here lived and mused that unforgotten Man! Might Language speak, what only Feeling can, As here I view these venerable walls And slow as in some fane my footstep falls, Young hearts would echo to a welcome strain, And feel, as I do,—Johnson live again! O'er Time's vast sea a century's waves have roll'd, And many a knell hath unregarded knoll'd, Since, fondly wrapt in meditative gloom, The sage of England sat in this lone room: Yet, well may Fancy, at yon evening-fire Behold him seated; and when moods inspire, (As Sorrow droop'd, or Hope her wings unfurl'd) His spirit hover through the varied world Of life and conduct, fortune, truth, or fate, His future glory, and his present state: Or, when the noonshine reign'd in golden power And dimly smiled some melancholy Tower, Muse at his window with far-wandering eye, And drink the freshness of the open sky; Or round the gateway woo admiring Ears To listen, while he charm'd beyond his years, By spoken magic, or electric wit That flash'd severe, yet sparkled where it hit:— A bright deception! far too often seen To hide the heart where agony has been. Oh! hideous mockery the mind endures, To forge the smile whose merriment allures, To gild a moment with fictitious ray Yet feel a viper on the spirit prey! Departed Soul! how oft when Laughter fed On the bright frolic which thy fancy bred, And happy natures, as they saw thee smile, Seem'd mingling with thy sunny heart awhile, Back to thy chamber didst thou darkly steal, And there the blight of thine own bosom feel? Then sink to slumber with a heated brain, To-morrow wake, and wear that smile again! I know not why, but since a dream of Fame, My heart hath gloried in great Johnson's name, And deeper worship to his Spirit vow'd Than others have to loftier worth allow'd. In what a mould was his high nature cast, Who never ventured, but he all surpass'd! And reign'd amid the realms of thought alone, Nor left an equal to ascend his throne. How truly deep, how tenderly divine; The lofty meaning, the majestic line! A moral sweetness, a persuasive flow Of happy diction, whether joy or wo Touch'd the deep springs of his devoted mind, Where'er they muse, delighted myriads find; And though the bleakness of his spirit threw Round earth's rare sunshine too severe a hue, How Life and Character before him stand, Their mysteries open, and their scenes expand! And well for wisdom, could the loud pretence Of puny language with profoundest sense, Such massy substance in the meaning show, As that which ages to a Johnson owe! Descend from learning to the nearer view, Where Man appears in vital colours true; And where was Piety more deeply shrined, Than in the temple of that awful Mind Whence day and night eternal incense rose To Him from whom the tide of Being flows! That self-respect, around whose constant sway The purest beams of happiness must play, He ever felt; the same proud dream it gave To hours that wither'd in the toils of Cave, And him, in aidless fortune high and free, Who taught a Lord how mean a Lord could be! And, mix'd with harshness, irritably loud, Which came like thunder from the social cloud Which pride or pertness round the moment threw, His faith, how firm! his tenderness, how true! For Goldsmith's worth, or Garrick's lighter grace, The tears of fondness trembled down his face; And when did Want or Wo to him appeal, Nor find a hand to give, a heart to feel? While Truth he worshipp'd with severest awe, Of Fame the glory, and to life a law. So great he lived: yet round the greatest soul How weakness hovers with its vile control! As when some organ of the frame appears In matchless strength beyond the mould of years, A weakness balancing that strength is found; So oft in mind where miracles abound, The lying pettiness of nature seems Revenged in mocking what perfection dreams. In Johnson thus: the piety which trod Each path of life, communing with his God, In gloomy hours could childish phantoms see, And give to Penance what was due to tea! The mind that reason'd on the fate of Man, And soar'd as high as wingless nature can, Would oft descend, the petty bigot show, And roll lip-thunders o'er some prostrate foe! Or else, in whirlwind fury sweep along, And risk the right, to prove a victor wrong. The Soul which spake angelically wise When Truth and he were throned amid the skies, In human life his Rasselas forgot To wear the meanness of our common lot, By passion bow'd, each prejudice obey'd, And grew ferocious o'er a smile betray'd! Yet peace to such! of all by men adored, Than Johnson, who could better, faults afford? Let Time exult that such a man hath been, And England follow where his steps are seen. To swell the records of collegiate-fame See Lincoln rise, and claim her Davenant's name; Within her walls the minstrel-student wove Poetic dreams of melody and love. On him, as yet a verse-enchanted child, The prince of nature, Shakspeare's self, had smiled! Oh! to have listen'd to that glorious Tongue, And seen the Man on whom a World has hung, Till admiration, too intensely wrought, Becomes a worship, and adores in thought! And, Wesley! often in thy room I see A holy Shadow which resembles thee; Let others laugh at that o'erheated mind Which never gloried but to bless Mankind; Be ours the tribute to as pure a soul As Fame recordeth in her sacred roll. A kindred line to pious Hervey pay, Whom Lincoln boasted in his morning-day: When night begins, and starry wonders teem, My fancy paints him in some mental dream, With eye upturn'd to where th' Almighty shone While vision'd angels warbled round His throne. From Christ Church, lo! a dazzling Host appears Whom Time has hallow'd, and the World reveres, Of prelates, orators, and statesmen high, To be forgotten,—when the world shall die! 'Twas here the muse of Tragedy divine Bade Jonson rise, and picture Catiline; Immortal Ben! to Selden dear, and fraught With all that Homer loved, or Plato taught. A later age, and Locke's eternal mind Here soar'd to Reason, such as Heaven design'd; Help'd Understanding to redeem her sway, And out of night call'd intellectual day. One evening, when delightful converse glow'd, As friend on friend his gleam of thought bestow'd, That spark was struck which set the soul on fire, Whence sprang the work fond ages shall admire. Hours worthy Heaven! when cultured spirits meet Within the chamber of divine retreat; There Friendship lives; there mental Fondness reigns; And hearts, oblivious of their lonely pains, By feeling blended, one communion make, To keep the brightness of the soul awake. But who can languish through the leaden hour When Heart is dead, and only Wine hath power? That brainless meeting of congenial fools Whose highest wisdom is to hate the Schools, Discuss a Tandem, or describe a race, And curse the Proctor with a solemn face; Swear Nonsense wit, and Intellect a sin, Loll o'er the wine, and asininely grin,— Hard is the doom when awkward chance decoys A moment's homage to their brutal joys! What fogs of dulness fill the heated room Bedimm'd with smoke, and poison'd with perfume! Where now and then some rattling tongue awakes In oaths of thunder, till the chamber shakes. Then Midnight comes, intoxicating maid! What heroes snore, beneath the table laid! But, still reserved to upright posture true, Behold! how stately are yon sterling few:— Soon o'er their sodden nature wine prevails, Decanters triumph, and the drunkard fails: As weary tapers at some wondrous rout Their strength departed, winkingly go out, Each spirit flickers till its light is o'er, And all are darken'd who were drunk before! Oh! thou, whose eloquence and wit combined To make their throne the heart of all Mankind; Whom Memory visions in his wonted place Where passions lighten'd o'er a speaking face, And sounds of feeling from the soul were heard, While music hung on every magic word,— Regretted Canning! oft has Christ Church seen Thy glance of lustre sparkle round her scene: From Eton famed, where dazzling merit shone In each young theme thy Genius smiled upon, Her walls received thee; where thy talents grew, Bright in the welcome of her fostering view, Till glowing Senates mark'd thy spirit rise, And England hail'd it with applauding eyes. Alas! that in thy Manhood's noble bloom, The shades of death hung grimly o'er thy doom, Thy frame, too weak, a fiery spirit wore, Though Mind prevail'd till Life's last pulse was o'er! Thy funeral knell, oh! when I heard it moan Like the deep echo of a Nation's groan; That Sky beheld, where sorrow loves to gaze When mystery wraps us or the world betrays; And thought how soon thy glorious sun had set! I felt a sadness, which inspires me yet: But had I, demon-like, e'er wing'd the dart Whose poison fed upon thy feeling heart, Inflicted pangs where only praise was due, And vilely thwarted every soaring view, A more than melancholy for him who died, Slain by the weapons which Renown supplied, My soul had borne; and, wrung with inward shame, Cursed the dark hour that wounded Canning's fame! The yew-tree'd walk, and wilderness of shade Where rosily the twilight-hues have play'd, By Denham haunted, Trinity! revere; There wander'd he, no step invasive near, The world forgot, amid Parnassian skill, And dream'd the melodies of “Cooper's Hill.” And haughty Chatham, at whose humbling word Proud Walpole trembled, when its sway was heard; Who baffled Spain, America, and Gaul, To throne his England like a Queen o'er all,— Thy paths have echo'd his immortal feet, Thy Shades enjoy'd him in sublime retreat. Here Warton's soul emparadised his hours, And strew'd Antiquity with classic flowers; Where'er he went, saw dim Cathedrals rise, Or Gothic windows in their sunset-dyes. And thou, whose ever-gentle page is fraught With the sweet lore poetic sadness taught, Not unremember'd let thy name be found Where Genius hallows an enchanted ground. Upon that brow the seal of Time hath set A mournful grace, but left no dark regret For wither'd years, whose flowery bloom remains In the pure freshness of Aonian strains. Yet oft thy Memory in creative gloom May fondly sigh o'er many a distant tomb, Where moulder forms which brighten'd other Days Whose eyes have glisten'd o'er thy youthful lays! Thy noontide spent, serener twilight glows Around thy spirit like a soft repose; And oft I turn, when fancy wanders free, Romantic Bowles! to meditate with thee: Oh! long in Bremhill may the village-chime Peal solemn anthems o'er departed Time; And fairy echoes, while they float along, Awaken visions which were born in song, Of hope and fame, when first thy feeling Youth Their beauty painted on a world of truth. Thy pleasing life, in pastoral quiet spent, Where heaven and earth comminglingly are blent, A prayer evokes, that England long may see In wood-hung vales, from city-murmur free That landscape-charm in varied shadow drest— The village-steeple with its towery crest, When dimly taper'd by romantic height, Or grayly melted into morning-light. Not Windsor vast, with battlemented towers, With charm so deep a pensive gaze o'erpowers As village-spires, in native valleys seen, With nature all around them, hush'd and green: How oft some eye, as o'er the wheel-track'd road The whirling Coach conducts its motley load, Hath wistful gazed where neat the parsonage rose, With Church behind it in revered repose! Ah! little know they, whom the harsh declaim Of Folly leads to scorn a Curate's name, In hamlets lone what lofty minds abound And spread the smiles of charity around! It was not that a frowning Chance denied An early wreath of honourable pride: In College-rolls triumphantly they shine, And proudly Alma Mater calls them, “mine!” But heavenlier dreams than ever Fame inspired Their spirit haunted, as the World retired. The fameless quiet of parochial care And sylvan home, their fancy stoop'd to share; And when arrived, no deeper bliss they sought Than that which undenying heaven had brought. On such, perchance, renown may never beam, Though oft it glitter'd in some College-dream; But theirs the fame no worldly scenes supply, Who teach us how to live, and how to die! In life so calm, unworldly, and refined, What pictured loveliness allures the mind! Hast thou forgot that balmy summer-noon That glow'd so fair, and fled, alas! so soon, My chosen Friend! in whose fond smile I see A spirit noble, and a nature free, When Blenheim woo'd us to that proud domain Where History smiles, and Marlborough lives again. And on the way how sweet retirement threw A shade of promise o'er Life's distant view? How softly-beautiful the bending sky, Like heaven reveal'd, burst radiant on the eye! A Spirit, bosom'd in the winds, appear'd To chant noon-hymns, where'er a sound career'd; While ev'ry leaf a living gladness wore And bird-like flutter'd as the breeze pass'd o'er: The lark made music in the golden air; The green earth, yellow'd by a sunny glare, In twinkling dyes beheld its flowery race Dance to the wind and bloom with sparkling grace; Faint, sweet, and far, we heard the sheep-bell sound, While insect-happiness prevail'd around: And rich varieties of hill and glade, Where viewless streams, by verdure oft betray'd, (Like Charity, who walks the world unseen Yet leaves a light where'er her hand hath been) By bank and mead roll'd windingly away,— 'Twas ours to witness in adorn'd array. Noon glided on, till day's declining glow Beheld us sweeping o'er the verdant flow Of meadow'd vales, to where the village-hill In garden bloom we welcomed, bright and still. That sunny eve in smiling converse fled Around a banquet generously spread, Beneath a roof where Elegance combined The pure in Taste with Fancy the refined:— The Church antique, whose ivied turret won The dream-like changes of departing sun And glanced upon us at our parting hour, I still remember in its beauteous power. Then home we sped beside romantic trees Whose leaf-pomp glitter'd to the starting breeze, And fondly view'd in symmetry of shade The mimic branches on the meadows laid. In wave-like glory burn'd the sunset sky; Where rosy billows seem'd to swell and lie Gleaming and vast;—as if that haughty Day Ere yet th' horizon saw him sink away, His clouds and colours vassal-like would see Once more awake, and own their deity! Where Balliol frowns along yon ancient road, By Evelyn hallow'd, his endear'd abode I never pass, nor think of them who died, Heroic Martyrs, burning side by side! Upon her walls there hung a crimson glare, And red fires raven'd on the breezeless air; But thou, false Bigot! in that murderous hour To heaven couldst look, and on thy victims lour, Then feed thy gaze with agonies of fire, As limb by limb the tortured Saints expire! In serpent-writhings, lo! the flames awake, Hiss as they whirl, and riot round the Stake; While mitred fiends, as they behold them rise, Glare on the martyrs with their wolfish eyes! Yet firm they stand: behold! what Glories smile Above the fury of that burning pile; Ten thousand harps, ten thousand anthems swell. And heaven is worshipp'd in a scene of hell! Here Southey, in the spring-like morn of youth, His feeling, conduct, and his fancy, truth, Beheld the orb of Liberty arise To gild the earth with glory from the skies: What wonder, then, if his Chaldean gaze With glowing worship met her morning-rays, Beheld them bright as freedom's rays should be And thought they darted from a deity? Who did not feel, when first her shackles fell, The truth sublime that France inspired so well,— There is a freedom in the Soul of man No Tyrant quenches, and no Torture can! But when high Virtue from her throne was hurl'd And Gaul became the dungeon of the World, No mean deserter was that patriot proved Whose Manhood censured what his Youth had loved. In bloom of life he sought domestic shade, Devoting hours a world had not betray'd In deep affection to delightful lore, Which Feeling loves, and Wisdom may adore. While others linger'd in the restless Town To wear the thorny wreath of young renown: Or, spirit-worn, see rivals mount above, With few to honour, and with none to love,— Afar to Keswick's mountain-calm he hied, And found the haven which a Home supplied. There Nature pure to his pure soul appeals, With Her he wanders, and with Her he feels, While earth and sky for poesy unite, And the hush'd mountains hallow morn and night. Thus flowingly the fairy hours depart And each day adds a virtue to the heart. Ah, blissful Lot! which few have lived to share Who haunt the world, and seek to find it there? Forgetful that one day of Life is fraught With years of meaning for inductive Thought, In baffled hope the mind exhales away, Their each to-morrow a renew'd to-day; Too meanly anxious for some poor applause, They burn for Glory, but betray her cause. True fame is genius, in its earthless hour Sent from the soul with world-subduing power, From heart to heart electrically known Till Realms admire, and Ages are its own! Oh! blest resolve which consecrates a life To leave for studious calm the noisome strife Of London's everlasting round of self, Pursued by Learning, or career'd for Pelf. In wise seclusion heaven-ward thoughts incline To form in Man the elements divine; From day to day their semblance nearer grows, Till kindred Mind a kindred Maker knows; And then, what beautiful accordance seen In all that Wisdom taught, or time hath been! What once was dark becomes divinely clear, And earth itself a heaven-reflecting sphere. That living God enthron'd all worlds above Whose Name and Nature are reveal'd by Love, Our spirit feels within itself abide, The Will direct, and o'er each thought preside; In man or nature, whatso'er befal— True faith can fathom and interpret all! Turn from the calm secluded life bestows, A life which Evelyn loved and Southey knows, To London; where a world of anxious mind In one dark fever of excess we find; Where talent sparkles with incessant rays, And authors perish—for the want of praise! Though minds abound, whose magical control, Like truth from heaven, can elevate the soul, Too rapidly our soaring authors teem For each to fill the circle of his dream. Though high the hope which Energy awakes, And far the flight a free-wing'd Spirit takes, A thousand hearts o'er disappointment bleed, The many venture, but the few succeed. Hence of all crimes, the last to be forgiven Eternal barrier to some critic's heaven, Success is proved;—that hour Her star appears In daring brightness to outdazzle years, The fogs of hate, the clouds of dulness rise, To quench her lustre, and deface her skies; Hence martial pens in pugilistic rage, And venom oozing from each vulgar page, Slander abroad on its exulting wings To frighten fools, or flap the face of kings, While faded authors, overcome with bile, Turn into villains, and lampoon the Isle! But, hark! to sounds so musically dear, By Flattery melted into Folly's ear; Behold a “Lion” who must roar to-night, And doubt if homage be not man's delight! Amid the sweet, soft words, which come and go From lord to lady, and from belle to beau, There in thyself a night-throned Idol see, 'Tis all thou art, and all a fool should be! Enamour'd thus, nonsensically dream Thy mental worth a supernat'ral theme; Yet, look around thee ere the night be o'er, Thy heart is free, and thou a fool no more! Thy mien, thy manners, and thy person tend To make no charm Politeness could commend; And, lest they should not quite sufficient see, The faults of others are bestow'd on thee; Thus on, till all that once was “glory” thought From tongue to tongue is whisper'd into nought; While each is conscious, as thy fame's o'erthrown, To wound another's, is to heal his own. Yet oft ambiguous Hate her truth beguiles, And Envy wriggles into serpent-smiles! Some cringing, cawing, sycophantic Sneak With heart as hollow as his head is weak, In smother'd voice will chance a rival sue To feed the pages of a starved Review: “Dear Sir! I think your genius quite divine,”— To-morrow, turn, and lash it line by line! And can it be, to such ignoble life Of ceaseless longing and chicaning strife, Where fever'd passion frets the hour along, That woman's gentler soul would fain belong? Oh! deem not the assuming pride of Man Would claim a glory which no Woman can; Nor think to her soft nature is not given The flame of genius with the form of heaven. Her tenderness hath made our harshness weep, And hush'd our passions into child-like sleep; Her dewy words fall freshly on the soul; Her numbers sweet as seraph-music roll; And beautiful the morn-like burst of mind When first her spirit wakens o'er mankind! Now painting clouds, now imaging the sea, Bloom on the flower, and verdure on the tree! But diff'rent far a genius thus display'd, From mind corrupted into menial trade, When reputation is the theme adored, And pilfer'd learning all its charms afford, Those hues divine which delicately please, The smile unfashion'd, and the soul at ease, All, all that language is too frail to tell Which forms in woman what we feel so well, In public life too often dies away Like dreams forgotten in the flush of day. There, taunting Pens dissect her dubious claim, Or jeering coxcombs jest away her fame:— Behold the beauty of yon garden-flower In lovely bloom beside its native bower; What winning freshness in its healthful dye, Pure as the spring, and radiant as the sky! Transplant it thence to some o'erheated room, Where hands profane it,—and, alas, the bloom! Let Man his intellectual sceptre wield; To him have Ages in their march appeal'd To shape the Elements of mind and power Through the vast scene of Life's unrestful hour. But thou, fond Woman! on affection's throne, Behold a kingdom of the Heart thine own! Their feelings form the subjects of thy sway, And all is Eden where thy glances play: 'Tis thine to brighten far from public strife The daily windings of domestic life, And by thy grace and gentleness of mien Adorn and beautify Home's varied scene. Pleasant is Morning, when her radiant eye Opes on the world, enchanting all the sky; And Ev'ning, with her balmy glow of light, The beauteous herald of romantic night: And pleasant oft to some poetic Mind The sound of water, and the sweep of wind, A friend renew'd in some heart-welcomed place, With years of fondness rising in his face; The tear which answers to a tale of woe, And happy feelings in their heavenward flow: But sweeter far proves his revengeful lot Whom Fame hath slighted, or the World forgot, When printed falsehood gratifies each bent, And mangles volumes to the heart's content; Corrupts what style, creates what fault you please, Laughs o'er the truth, and lies with graceful ease! Thus Envy lives; and Disappointment heals; The gangrened wounds a tortured memory feels; And wither'd hopes delightful vengeance wreak, While pages witness more than scorn could speak. And thus with one, whose life I now recal; When pens were daggers, he endured them all! Each Reptile started from his snug review To spit out poison,—as most reptiles do; Oh, how they feasted on each faulty line, And generously made their dulness thine! From page to page they grinn'd a ghastly smile, Yet seem'd to look so heaven-like all the while: Then, talk'd of merit to the world unknown, Ah! who could doubt them, for they meant their own. Religion, too! what right had Youth to scan That scheme of Glory which Heaven unveils for man; Or paint around him, wheresoe'er he trod, The glowing fulness of eternal God? Indeed, 'twas hinted,—hoped it was untrue! His heart had worn an atheistic hue; And still religion, though its hallow'd name Imparted freshness to his early fame, Had not alike both heart and head inspired; In short, the World was sick, and they were tired; And then to prove his verse was more than vile They wrote bad prose with overflowing bile! But venal Commerce hired a Serpent too To sound his rattle in the Scotch review; And yet, (alas! that such ignoble end Should baffle those who injured Taste defend!) Though perfect lies were most profoundly said A Poet triumph'd and the Public read; For truth is stronger than the envious know, And gains new vigour from the vilest blow; And when abusive falsehoods cease to pay, Malice grows dumb, and slander dies away. The faded past my fancy haunts again; And lo! thine image shadow'd o'er my strain, Thou lovely Spirit of celestial worth! Whose saint-like pureness so adorn'd the earth, And, when it vanish'd, thrill'd a world with woe, And thoughts, which seldom into language flow, But silently within the soul retire And all the sacredness of grief inspire. Yet, words and tears have minglingly adored, Deep, warm, and true, as feeling Hearts afford, Those angel-attributes which good men prize, Lamented Heber! when they leave the skies, A while some Spirit pure as thine array, Smile on the World, and heaven-like pass away. There is a shadow round the holy Dead: A mystery, wherein we seem to tread, As oft their lineaments of Life awake And sorrowing Thoughts their hallow'd semblance take. What once they dreamt, when mortal nature threw Phantasmal dimness round each soaring view, Now, all unearth'd, beatified, and free From toil and tears,—their unscaled Eyes can see: No more on them the fitful whirl of things From joy to gloom, eternal trial brings; In light array'd, before The Throne they shine, And learn the mysteries of Love Divine: Why tears were shed, why pangs of woe prevail'd, Why Goodness mourn'd, and Virtue often fail'd, No longer now a with'ring shadow throws Like that which hovers round the World's repose. The holy dead! of Earth and Heaven the dear! Whene'er the darkness of our troubled sphere 'Twixt God and Man will demon-like arise, The soul deject, and doubt away the skies, Then Mem'ry points to where their feet have trod, Redeems our nature, and recals her God. Creation's debt to discontented Time They help'd to cancel by a worth sublime, And wisdom, which enthrones the good and great High o'er the meanness of our mortal state; The smile that withers in its cynic play Each hope of earth when budding into day, By merit awed, in forceless meaning falls, Whenever mind exalted mind recals, Since eras bright of holiness and love Their spirits promise from a World above! And such was he, whose toiling virtues won A tomb of fame beneath a foreign sun. In childhood, ev'ry dawning sweetness made A tender magic which no truth betray'd; While, fond as feeble, blendingly began Those mental traits that ripen into man. Romance and fairies, and Crusades inspired The poesy which deeper Years admired: Heaven's awful Book he loved to learn and read, And mourn'd to see the great Redeemer bleed; In all he did, benevolence prevail'd, And from his frown no shrinking pauper quail'd; Nor form of Woe, nor face of Grief, he pass'd, But pitied all, and pitied to his last! From Neasden fresh, lo! Oxford hails him now, And fancies new are bright'ning o'er his brow: Too warmly toned, too feelingly endow'd, Companionless to linger in the crowd, A brother's fame around him lives and blooms, His mind awakes,—and magic fills his rooms! Where souls have listen'd as he charm'd the hour, And young eyes sparkled to confess his power. Still, unentangled by the social net, Though smile and banquet oft the heart beset, Each dawn beheld him at his classic tome, And pure, as in his unforgotten home. Scarce enter'd yet, and honours flower'd his way! And soon the music of a master-lay From circling thousands woke a thrill divine While England wept o'er weeping “Palestine!” There are, that still in this cold world remain, Whose ears are haunted by that holy strain, Whose eyes dejected Salem still behold As scene on scene the vision was unroll'd, When invocation with her sweetest sound Woo'd angel-forms, and angels watch'd around! While grandly swelling into giant view, “Like some tall palm the noiseless Fabric grew!” Then Israel harping by her willow'd streams, And Prophets bright with more than prophet-dreams, The poet vision'd in his pictured strain Amid the glory of Millennium's reign: Then, bade his Thunders tell of time no more, Till Nature shudder'd at their dooming roar! Fond eyes were fix'd upon the Minstrel now; A raptured sire beheld his laurell'd brow; And blest his boy with all that tears bestow When Heaven seems by, and human hearts o'erflow: And where was he? escaped the glowing throng, In the proud moment of triumphant song He sought his chamber;—silent and alone A Mother saw him at his Maker's throne! That hour hath pass'd: a village-curate made, How nobly seen amid the pastoral shade! Parochial cares his cultured mind employ, Domestic life and intellectual joy. The old men cry, a blessing on his head! And Angels meet him at the dying bed; Let fever rage; disease or famine roll Tormenting clouds which madden o'er the soul, Where life exists, there Heber's love is found, And heaven created by its welcome sound! None are all blest; without some mental strife To ripple, not destroy, the calm of life: That heart for ever open to the poor, Who weeping came, but smiling left his door, Was all unapt, when mean annoyments rose From rustic fools or mercenary foes, By happy lightness to o'erleap them all, And melt the clouds which daily life befal. More wisely oft, where common nature guides, A pliant spirit of the world presides, Than he, whose loftiness of feeling fails To stoop or wind, as subtlety prevails. Nor could that Soul, though high its lot had been, Forget to paint a more expanded scene, Or sphere of duty where his mind would sway The wider realms of intellectual day. They dawn'd at length! a not unclouded dream, From golden climes by Ganga's idol-stream. That Indian soil poetic Fancy knew,— Her sculptured wrecks, and mountain's roseate view, Her palmy meads by banks of radiant green, And dusky cots where cooling plantains lean. But when he felt a meek-eyed Mother's gaze, And thought how soon might end her lonely days! Beheld his child in cradled hush asleep, Too frail to dare the thunders of the deep; His books deserted, friendship's riven chain, And he, a pilgrim on the boundless main,— That strife of soul might well forbid him roam, And softly hue the tenderness of home! Those shading doubts a Providence dispell'd; Each home-born fear aspiring goodness quell'd: The parting o'er, behold! the billows sweep In rushing music as he rides the Deep, That wafts him onward to his Indian clime, While mused his heart on future toil sublime, Whereby Redemption and her God would smile On heathen Lands, and many a lonely isle, Where stinted Nature, in degraded gloom From age to age had wither'd to the tomb! And haply, too, when rose the twilight-star, And billows flutter'd in a breezy war, At that dim hour regretted England came, Familiar walks, and sounds of early fame, And village-steeple, with the lowly race, Whose fondness brighten'd to behold his face! The Land was reach'd; and oh! too fondly known How Heber made that sunny Land his own, Till pagan souls a Christian nature wore, And feelings sprang which never bloom'd before, As toil'd he there with apostolic truth, Redeem'd the Aged, and reform'd her Youth, For praise to honour with a powerless line A heart so deep, a spirit so divine! He lived; he died; in life and death the same, A Christian martyr! whose majestic fame In beacon-glory o'er the world shall blaze, And lighten Empires with celestial rays, While Virtue throbs, or human hearts admire A poet's feeling with a prophet's fire, Or pure Religion hath a shrine to own Where man can worship at his Maker's throne! PART II. “The still air of delightful studies.”—Milton. “? To range Where silver Isis leads the stripling feet; Pace the long Avenue, or glide adown The stream-like windings of that glorious street!” Wordsworth. ANALYSIS OF PART II.

And thus, o'er visions of thy matchless few Hath Fancy revell'd in her fleet review; And, oh my country, glorious, brave, and free, Heart of the world! what spirits hallow thee! There is a magic in thy mighty name, A swell of glory, and a sound of fame; And myriads feel upon thy hills and plains The patriot-blood rush warmer to their veins, As all thou wert, and art, the mind surveys With glowing wonder and enchanted gaze! To this proud scene of architect'ral pride, To all but Her, the ocean-famed, denied, A parent sends, with many a voiceless fear, His child, to arm him for the world's career. Nor deem unawful that remember'd hour When Fate and Fortune, with seductive power, To Inexperience urge their blended claim, And lead to honour, or allure to shame. At length, young Novice! comes that hush'd farewell Which words deny, but tears as truly tell; The distance won, behold! at evening-hour Thine eye's first wonder fix'd on Maudlin tower; Then, Gothic Structures, as they swell to view In steepled vastness, dark with ages' hue; And on thine ear when first the morn-bells wake As o'er the wind their wafted echoes break, Delighted fancy will illume thy brow, To feel thyself in ancient Oxford now! Collegiate life next opens on thy way, Begins at morn, and mingles with the day; The pillar'd-Cloister, in whose twilight gloom Pale dreams arise, like shadows from the tomb, Now hears thy step: and well at first I ween, The stately Chapel, with its sculptured screen; The windows dim, where Bible-dramas live For ages in the glow which colours give, And golden beams of mellow'd radiance pass Through vested figures on the tinted glass, While Saints and Prophets, Priests and Prelates there, And mitred Abbots, kneel in blended prayer; The graven fretwork on the Gothic wall, And flowery roof, which over-arches all,— These in full action now, combine their charm, And thrill young feelings, with devotion warm. But, now the walk of wonder through the town In the stiff foldings of a new-bought Gown! From cap and robe what awkward shyness steals! How wild à truth the dazzled Novice feels! Restless the eye, his voice a nervous sound, While laughing echoes are evoked around; Each look he faces seems on him to leer, And fancied giggles are for ever near! Through High-street then, the Town's majestic pride, Array'd with palaces on either side, He roams: him tradesmen's greedy eyes behold, Each pocket gaping for a freshman's gold. The Clarendon may next his look beguile, Theatric dome, and Ashmoléan pile; Or Bodley-chambers, where in dusky rows, The volumed wonders of the Past repose; Or, some bold thought his wayward fancy rules, To take a freeze of horror from the Schools, From lofty benches send a downward gaze, Hear awful sounds, and dream of future Days! But lo! in towering pride, with massy gate, The Clarendon uprears its modern state; There pause, and think; for then a sense sublime, How proud a victor over Space and Time When Mind hath wielded its undaunted power Is man, both slave and monarch of an hour!— Comes o'er thy spirit with unutter'd thought, Life melody with years of feeling fraught. Yet, not the miracles of England's Press, (That mighty Oracle to curse or bless!) Alone the worship of high thought demand; Lo! earth-wide dreams around the soul expand, As dwells thy gaze on yon enormous piles Of hallow'd Books, for heathen Lands and Isles; A godlike present for benighted Man Far as the soul can read Salvation's plan! Transcendent thought! when changing Years have flown Yon Bibles speak to every Clime and Zone! The hut, the hovel, or the cottage wild Where Sorrow shudders o'er her weeping child, Their living words of holiness and love Like angel-tones, shall warble from Above. Omnipotence is there!—a power to be God's voice on earth, inspired with Deity; Thou Infidel! in tomb-like darkness laid, By heaven deserted, and by sin betray'd; And thou, pale mutt'rer in some midnight-cell, Whose sad to-morrow is a dream of hell; There is a Voice to wake, a Word to spread Deep as the thunders which arouse the dead! That Sound is heard; a Welcome from the skies! Despair is vanquish'd, and Dejection flies; Hope fills a heart where agonies have been, The dungeon brightens, and a God is seen! Immortal Pages! may your spirit pour Celestial day, till heathen night be o'er. In fiery lands, where roving Ganga reigns, Eternal pilgrim of a thousand plains! The tawny Indian, (when the Day is done And basking waters redden in the sun, Behold him seated, with his babes around, To fathom mysteries where a God is found! The Book is oped, some wondrous page began, Where heaven is offered to forgiven man; Lo! as he reads, what voiceless wonder steals On all he fancies, and on all he feels! Till o'er his mind, by mute devotion wrought, The gleaming twilight of regen'rate thought Begins, and heaven-eyed Faith salutes above The God of glory, and a Lord of love! “Thou dread Unknown! Thou unimagined Whole! Thou vast Supreme, and Universal Soul, Oft in the whirlwind have I shaped Thy form, Or throned in thunder heard Thee sway the storm! And when the ocean's heaving vastness grew Black with Thy curse,—my spirit darken'd too! But when the world beneath a sun-gaze smiled And not a cloud the crystal air defiled, Then I have loved Thee, Thou parental One, Thy frown a tempest, and Thy smile a sun! But if there be, as heaven-breathed words relate, A seraph-home in some hereafter-State, Almighty Power! thy dark-soul'd Indian see And grant the Mercy which has bled for me!” O'er Oxford thus the staring freshman roves By solemn Temples, or secluded Groves; Then, introduced, the social charms begin By tongues which flatter, or by hearts that win; Mien, mind, and manner,—all in varied style Now woo his fortune, or reflect his smile. For here, as in the World's unbounded sphere, The countless traits of character appear. In some proud youth, of feeling soul, we find The winning magic of a noble mind; Truth, taste, and sense whate'er he does pervade, No virtue lost, no principle betray'd; Another,—wildness marks his mien and tone! His hand extends—and honours are his own; Eternal plaudits in his ear resound; He rides on wings, while others walk the ground! A contrast see, whom hearts nor dreams inspire, The booby offspring of a booby sire, With leaden visage passionlessly cold And ev'ry feeling round himself enroll'd. Then, happy Pertness! how sincerely vain! And, sour Perfection!—what sublime disdain! For ever in detraction's art employ'd, No virtue welcomed, and no look enjoy'd: Then, pompous Learning! deeply read and skill'd In pages which profoundest heads have fill'd, Yet harsh and tasteless, and but rarely fraught With knowledge sprung from self-excited thought. But, save me, Heav'n! from what no words can tell, A human Nothing, made of strut and swell, Who thinks no University contains Sufficient wisdom to employ his brains: Yet, frothy Creature! what a vacant skull! In all but falsehood villanous and dull; Big words and oaths in one wild volley roll, And Nature blushes for so mean a soul! By these begirt, how oft may heart-warm Youth Grow blindly fond, and misinterpret Truth, When feelings in their flush'd dominion lend To fancied kindness what completes a friend! Now dawns the moment, doom'd in future years To waken triumph, or be born in tears; When Morals sway, Religion lives or dies, And cited Principles to action rise. Oh! thou, o'er whom a Mother's eye has wept, Or round thy cradle frequent vigils kept; Whose infant-brow a father's love survey'd, And oft for thee with Heav'n communion made; Be thine the circle where true Friendship lives In the pure light exalted spirit gives; And far from thee the infamous and vile Who murder feeling with a Stoic smile, Blaspheme the Innocence of early days, Make virtue vice, impiety a praise, Disease the health of unpolluted mind And call it glory to disgrace mankind! What though the eye may sparkle o'er the glass, Or fondling words for fascination pass, While flowers of friendship oft appear to bloom, In the false sunshine of a festive room, A day will come when sterner truths prevail And friendship dwindles into folly's tale! But shouldst thou waver, when the awful hour Of Pleasure tempteth with a demon-power, And time and circumstance together seem To dazzle nature with too bright a dream, Let Home and Virtue, what thou wert and art, A Mother's feeling, and a Father's heart, Full on thy mem'ry rise with blended charm And all the serpent in thy soul disarm! For who shall say, when first temptations win A yielded mind to some enchanting sin, What future crime, that once appear'd too black For life to wander o'er its hell-ward track, May lead the heart to that tremendous doom, Whose midnight hovers round an early tomb? Let Home be vision'd where thy budding days Their beauty open'd on parental gaze: For there, what memories of thee abound! Your chamber echoes with its wonted sound; The flow'r you reared, a sister's nursing hand Still fondly guards, and helps each leaf expand; The page you ponder'd with delighted brow Was ever dear,—but oh! far dearer now; The walk you loved with her sweet smile to share She oft repeats, and paints your image there; And when bright meanings have adorn'd the sky, Her fancy revels in your fav'rite dye; While oft at evening when domestic bloom Hath flung a freshness round a social room, When hearts unfold, and Music's wingèd note Can waft a feeling wheresoe'er it float, Some chord is touch'd, whose melodies awake The pang of fondness for a brother's sake; And Eyes are conscious, as they gaze around, That looks are falling where a son was found! Let home begird thee like a guardian dream, And time will wander an unsullied stream, Whose wildest motion is the rippled play Of rapid moments as they roll away! Meanwhile, delightful studies, deep and strong, To graduate-honours waft thy soul along; They come at length! and high in listed fame A College hails, a Country reads thy name; And in that List when first thy name appears, What triumph sparkles in those happy tears! In after-life, when Oxford's ancient towers Thy mem'ry visions in creative hours, Or college-friends a college-scene restore, Thy heart will banquet on the bliss of yore! Now mark a contrast, in whose meanness lies What purer thought should soaringly despise. From careless boyhood to uncultured man Indulged to act, ere principle began; With just enough of spirit for excess, And heart which nothing save a vice, can bless, In Oxford see the reprobate appear! Big with the promise of a mad career. With cash and consequence to lead the way, A fool by night, and more than fop by day, What happy vileness does his lot reveal! How Folly burns with imitative zeal Whene'er the shadows of his greatness fall In festive chamber, or collegiate-Hall! Romantic lot! to vegetate secure From all which might to mental paths allure; To wake each morning with no deeper thought Than that which yesterday's excess hath brought; Then, wing'd by impulse, as the day proceeds, To follow where coxcombic fashion leads. Hark! Woodstock rattles with eternal wheels, And hounds are ever barking at his heels, The Chapel, voted a terrific “bore,” The “Dons,” head-pieces for the college door! The Lecture scouted, the Degree reviled, And Alma Mater all save alma styled! Thus on; till Night advance, whose reign divine Is chastely delicate to cards and wine, Where modest themes amusive tongues excite And faces redden with the soul's delight; A Roman banquet! with Athenian flowers Of festive wit, to charm such graceful hours! Alas! that Truth must fling a doleful shade On the bright portrait which her hand hath made: Few years have fled, and what doth now remain Of him the haughty, who but smiled disdain On all young Virtue in her meekness dared, Ambition hoped, or Principle declared? His friends are dead; his fortune sunk away In midnight-Hells, where midnight-demons play; A wither'd Skeleton of sin and shame With nought but infamy to track his name The wreck of Fortune, with despairing sighs, Fades from the world, and like a felon dies! A nobler Theme! ere yet my strain conclude,— The learn'd and gifted, dignified and good, Those tasteful Guides, by whose directing hand The seeds of learning ripen or expand; And if one task there be the Soul to try, Whose with'ring toils a due reward defy, On them it falls whom Merit ranks her own And Talent seats on Education's throne. Each mode of mind, the stubborn, wise, or stern, The headstrong Wit that cannot stoop to learn, The dunce or drone, the freshman or the fool 'Tis their's to counsel, teach, o'erawe, and rule! Their daily meed, some execrating word To blight the hour when first their voice was heard, From prating coxcombs, whose foul tongues declare In froth and flippancy, what fools they are! Yet well may such a doom be nobly faced; There comes a scene by no dark cloud disgraced, An hour when Genius, borne aloft to fame, On Oxford sheds the brightness of her name, Whence first her wings those eagle-heights explored, Where now She reigns, adoring and adored! Then, he who taught her, shares with proud surprise And dewy gladness of delighted eyes, That hour triumphant, when a World repays The toilful dulness of collegiate-days. Ah! who forgets the Parents of the mind? What heart so dead, as no deep bliss to find In thoughts which wander to their school-day scene, Though years and distance darkly intervene? The foot-worn mead; the playmate, wood, and walk So sweetly shared in tenderness and talk; The feats and pranks of undejected Youth When Fancy wore the fairy mask of Truth, Dull, drear, and worldly is the Soul that sees No smile reflected from such joys as these! And they who haunt, from year to year content, That sacred home where studious hours are spent, Does fancy think their stormless life must be One still romance of mental liberty? Yet Mind alone, whate'er the lot or state, Her true delight must fancy or create; From her the sunshine and the shadows fall, Which brighten, tint, and oversway it all. The daily clockwork of collegiate-life Where nought is new, but Convocation-strife; The bigotry which olden Times beget; A sickly dulness, and a proud regret For aught which seems of reformation sprung, To let in light where ancient cobwebs hung, If such combine, where weaker traits are found, Who would not mourn that Fellowships abound? The mighty brothers of the Sun and Moon, Who tremble, lest a lip should smile too soon; Nor treat their mouths except with college twang, Where heavy words in heavy speeches hang; Who hate the Present, but adore the Past, And think their world the only one to last,— How pitiful! should such a race be seen, Where all the Monarchs of the mind have been. Retirement, classic love, and studious ease, A heart which deems it no disgrace to please, With retrospections fond of other Days When minds were nursed, that now repeat their praise,— A lot so calm no virtue will destroy, But season life for solitary joy. And yet, let shades of accident unite In happy union for its best delight, A life of Learning is a life forlorn:— Be mine the world which social scenes adorn, Where Woman's heart the central bliss is found, And happiness, the smile it sheds around!’ But night is throned; and full before me frown The dusky Steeples which o'ershade the town; High in the midst, a dark-domed shadow see,— The Radeliffe, pile of unworn majesty; Around it, silver'd by some window-ray Whirls many a smoke-wreath in ascending play: Beneath, what massy roofs inmingled lie, Misshaped by fancy, till they awe the eye! Hush'd are the groves, in leafy dimness veil'd, The winds unheard, as though they ne'er had rail'd. But hark! the iron voice of Wolsey's bell Floats o'er the city like his last farewell, While answ'ring Temples, with obedient sound, Peal to the night, and moan sad music round; But dread o'er all, like thunder heard in dreams, The warning spirit of that Echo seems! Now gates are barr'd; and, faithful to his stand, The crusty Porter, with his key-worn hand. Yet not with day, the day-born studies end; Wan cheeks, and weary brows,—I see them bend O'er haughty pages breathing ancient mind, For Man and Immortality design'd: The brain may burn, the martyr'd health may fail, And sunken eyelids speak a mournful tale Of days protracted into hideous length, Till mind is dead, and limbs deny their strength: Still, Honours woo!—and may they smile on thee, Prophetic Youth! as bright as visions see; Hours, days, and years severer far than thine, In toil, and gloom, and loneliness, are mine. The Day is earth, but holy Night is heav'n: To her a solitude of soul is given, Within whose depth, how beautiful to dream, And fondly be, what others vainly seem! Oh! 'tis an hour of consecrated might, For Earth's Immortals have adored the night; In song or vision yielding up the soul To the deep magic of Her still control. My own loved Hour! there comes no hour like thee, No world so glorious as thou form'st for me! The fretful ocean of eventful day To waveless nothing how it ebbs away! As oft the chamber, where some haunted Page Renews a Poet, or revives a Sage In pensive A thens, or sublimer Rome, To mental quiet woos the Spirit home. There Stillness reigns, how eloquently deep! And soundless air, more beautiful than sleep. Let Winter sway,—her sounds the scene inspires: The social murmur of a blazing fire; The hail-drop, hissing as it melts away In twinkling gleams of momentary play; Or wave-like swell of some retreated wind, In dying sadness echo'd o'er the mind, But gently ruffle into varied thought The calm of feeling blissful night has brought. How eyes the spirit with contented gaze The chamber mellow'd into social haze, And smiling walls, where, rank'd in solemn rows, The wizard Volumes of the Mind repose! Thus, well may hours like fairy waters glide, Till morning glimmers o'er their reckless tide; While dreams, beyond the realm of day to view, Around us hover in seraphic hue; Till Nature pines for intellectual rest, When home awakens, and the heart is blest; Or, from the window reads our wand'ring eye The starry language of Chaldèan sky, And gathers in that one vast gaze above, A bright eternity of awe and love! So heav'nly seems the visionary night: But, ah! the danger in such deep delight. The Mind, then beautified to fond excess, With all things dare to brighten, or to bless: A world of sense more spiritual is made Than the stern eye of nature hath survey'd; Some false perfection which hath never been, By fancy imaged, lives through ev'ry scene; But morn awakes, and lo, the spells unwind, As daylight melts light darkness o'er the mind! The worldly coarseness of our common lot Recals the shadows which the night forgot; Each dream of loftiness then dies away, And heav'n-light withers in the frown of Day! And then, the languor of each parching vein, And the hot weariness of heart and brain, That hideous shade of Something dread to be,— Oh, fatal midnight! these are doom'd for thee. Each breeze comes o'er us with tormenting wing, Each pulse of Sound an agony can bring; Let Chatterton Thy deathful charm reveal, And mournful White, whose genius loved to steal A placid sense of some angelic Pow'r Around prevailing at thine earthless hour. And oft, methinks, in loneliness of heart As noons of night in dreaming calm depart, My room is sadden'd with the mingled gaze Of Those who martyr'd their ambitious days; The turf-grass o'er their tombs,—I see it wave And visions waft me to a kindred grave! But lo! the yielding Dark hath gently died, And stars are sprinkled o'er yon azure tide Of lustrous air, which high and far prevails, Where now the queen-like moon in glory sails. City of fame! when Morn's first wings of light Wave their fresh beauty o'er thy mansions bright, Have I beheld thee; but a moonrise seems, Like hues that wander from a heaven of dreams, To hallow thee, as there thy Temples stand Sublimely tender, or serenely grand,— Spire, tower, and pinnacle, a dim array, Whose spectral features in the moonlight sway: The stony muteness of thy massive piles Now silver'd o'er by melancholy smiles, With more than language, spirit-like appeals To the high sense impassion'd Nature feels Of all which gloriously in earth or sky Exacts the worship of her gazing eye. There is a magic in the moonlit-hour Which Day hath never in its deepest pow'r Of light and bloom, when bird and bee resound, And new-born flow'rs imparadise the ground! And ne'er hath City, since a moon began To hallow nature for the eye of man, Steep'd in the freshness of her fairy light, More richly shone, than Oxford shines to-night. No lines of harshness on her Temples frown, But all in one soft magic melted down, Sublimer grown, through mellow air they rise And seem with vaster swell to awe the skies! On archèd windows how intensely gleams The glassy whiteness of reflected beams! Whose radiant slumber on the marble-tomb Of mitred Founders, in funereal gloom, Extends; or else in pallid shyness falls On Gothic casements, or collegiate-walls. The groves in silver-leaf'd array repose; And, Isis! how serene thy current flows With tinted surface by the meadow'd way, Without a ripple, or a breeze at play: Yet, once again shall summer-barks be seen, And furrow'd waters, where their flight has been; While sounding Rapture, as her heroes speed From Iffly locks, flies glorying o'er the mead, Hails from the bank as up the river ride In oary swiftness and exulting pride Her barks triumphal:—let the flag be rear'd, And thousands echo, when the Colour's cheer'd! Again upon the wind a wafted swell Of ebbing sound, proclaims a midnight-bell; Lo, phantom-clouds come floating by the moon, Then melt away, like happiness, too soon: And as they glide, an overshadowing smile Of moving light is mirror'd on each pile. Farewell the Scene! Farewell the fleeting song! Wherein my spirit hath been borne along In light and gloom through many a lonely hour, With nought to gladden but its own weak pow'r. In morning-youth far brighter dreams have play'd Around a Heart which hope has oft betray'd, Than those which hover o'er this dying strain; But, faded once, they never form again? “Farewell” to Oxford! soon will destined years That word awaken which is spoke by tears: When scheming Boyhood plann'd my future lot, No scene arose by Oxford centred not; And now, as oft her many-mingled chimes Swell into birth, like sounds of other times, Prophetic life a living mystery seems, Unravell'd oft by consummated dreams! Farewell! if when I cease to haunt her scene Some gentle heart remember I have been, As Oxford, with her palaces and spires, The mind ennobles, or the fancy fires, No vain reward his chosen theme attends Howe'er the fate of him who sung it, ends! Oh! fearful Time, the fathomless of thought, With what a myst'ry are thine ages fraught! Whose wings are noiseless in their rush sublime O'er scenes of glory, as o'er years of crime; Yet comes a moment when their speed is felt, Till Past and Future through our being melt, And boding shadows from a world unknown, Deepen around us, and bedim our own. A moment! well may that a moral be, Whoe'er thou art, 'tis memory to thee: A tomb it piled, a mother bore to heaven, Or like a whirlwind o'er the ocean driven Rush'd on thy fate with desolating sway, And flung a desert o'er its darken'd way! A moment!—Midnight wears a wonted hue, And orbs of beauty speck yon skyward view; Deep, hush'd, and holy is the world around, But yet, what energies of Life abound! In blended action through the realms of space Where time and nature multiply their race What crimes enacted, or what hearts awake Which beat for glory or with anguish break! And thou, dread spirit-World! to man unknown, Where reigns Jehovah on His sightless throne, Sense cannot view, but dreams would fain expand Their wings ethereal o'er that mystic Land Where Glory circles from the awful Three, And Life is Love, and Love is Deity. Who breathes, in good and ill must bear his part, And each can tell a history of heart, How Time hath tinged the moral of his years Through gloom or glory, triumph, pangs, or tears. And yet, howe'er Confession prove the right, To give it voice is deem'd a vain delight; And far too deeply is my mem'ry fraught With the cold lesson blighted hours have taught, To think a life so valueless as mine With the stern feelings of a world may twine. But words will rise from out perturbèd mind As heave the waters to the helmless wind, In some fond mood, when dreaming thoughts control Departed years that slumber in the soul! Life still is young, but not the world, with me; For where the freshness I was wont to see? A bloom hath vanish'd from the face of Things; Nor more the Syren of enchantment sings In sunny mead, or shady walk, or bower, Like that which warbled o'er my youthful hour. Let reason laugh, or elder wisdom smile On the warm phantasies which youth beguile, There is a pureness in that glorious prime Which mingles not with our maturer time. All earth is brighten'd from a sun within As yet unshaded by a world of sin, While mind and nature blendingly array In light and love, whate'er our dreams survey: Though perils darken from the distant years They vanish'd, cloud-like, when a smile appears! And the light woes that flutter o'er the mind Are laugh'd away, as foam upon the wind. Thou witching Spirit of a younger hour! Did I not feel thee in thy fullest pow'r, As oft school-free I rambled, lone and still Through the green twilight of some wooded hill; Or oped my lattice, when the moonshine lay In sleep-like beauty on the brow of Day, To watch the mystery of moving stars Through ether gliding on melodious cars; Or musing wander'd, ere the hectic morn, To see how beautiful the sun was born? A reign of glory from my soul hath past, And each Elysium proved mere Earth at last; Yet mourn I not in mock or puling strain, For joys are left which never beam in vain: The voice of friends, the changeless eye of love, And, oh! that bliss all other bliss above, To know, if shadow frown, or sunshine fall, There is One Spirit who pervadeth all! And has that fame, for which pure feelings pine, No motive sanction'd by a Creed divine? To be remember'd,—is the hope for this, A false ambition for unholy bliss? Time, Man, and Nature speak a deeper truth When hope predicts the fancies of our youth! But, 'tis not fame to form the midnight-show, Where Vice and Vanity alike may go; It is not fame, to hear the shallow prate Of busy Fondness, or intriguing Hate, To feast on sounds of patronising pride And wring from dulness what the world denied. A high-soul'd nature is its own renown, And needs no jewels to begem the crown! For 'mid the heat, the hurry and the strife, Or daily nothings of distemper'd life, Our spirit thirsteth for a purer World: O'er this the wings of fancy are unfurl'd; Hence painter's hue and poet's dream are brought, And the rich paradise of blooming thought: To quench that thirst, let heaven-born feelings flow, Let genius wake! let inspiration glow! Why thus we panted for a world like this May form a knowledge in our future bliss. All are not framed alike: Love, Hope, and Truth, Those three Inspirers which attend on youth, To various minds a varied tone impart; What this man freezes,—fires another's heart! The words that waken melodies of soul, In tuneless ears monotonously roll; The Shapes and Shadows which creation forms And Fancy moulds from seasons and from storms To living beauty or to lovely hue, And waves them phantom-like before our view, Will rouse the life-blood into fresher play Of him who visions what the words array: Another, eyeless save to sterner things, Will frown them back as false Imaginings! And thus in nature, as her vales reply To voices wafted where the echoes lie, Our spirits answer to appeals alone When tuned accordant with some inward tone. I've stood entranced beneath as bright a sun As Poet's dream hath ever gazed upon, In the warm stillness of that wooing hour When skies are floating with seraphic power, The gales expiring in melodious death, The waters hush'd, the woods without a breath; But when I look'd where lay immingled forms Of fairy mountains or refulgent storms, And cloud-born phantoms, delicately bright, Laugh'd in the paleness of departing light, Each fainting into each, a long array, Like lovely echoes when they glide away,— Another babbled in that beauteous hour, Light as the leaf, and mindless as the flower! Thou young Aspirer! darest thou dream of fame, And hope another Age will read thy name? The hidden stirrings of each voiceless pride, The pangs unutter'd, by the soul supplied, The ghastly dimness of dejected hope, By dreams assail'd with which no pride can cope; Those nameless thoughts of venom'd fierceness, sent From the dark heavings of our discontent; And, dreader still,—the clouds of daily life That welter round us in disease or strife, And the cold atmosphere of worldly sway Where Life is self, and Self the life of day, In mingled power will oft thy soul appal; Too well I picture, for I felt them all! Yet bear thou on! and when some breathing page Of godlike poet, or divinest sage, And secret energies of soul begin To feed the passion that is form'd within, Then let thy Spirit in her power arise And dare to speak the language of the Skies! Her voice may fail, in deathlike muteness lost, Her hopes be visions, and those visions cross'd; But, pure and noble if thy song began, And pour'd high meanings through the heart of man, Not echoless perchance a note hath been In some lone heart, or unimagined scene. How many a breeze that wings a noiseless way, How many a streamlet unbeheld by Day, How many a sunbeam lights a lonely flower, Yet works unseen in its creative power! Then highly soar, whene'er thy spirit feels The vivid sway impassion'd thought reveals; Unchill'd by scorn, undarken'd by despair, So Martyrs lived, and such the Mighty were! There is a pleasure in a praise denied; It feeds a folly, or protects a pride, It teaches Dulness what no Wit can say, “I don't approve, let no one write to-day.” Thou narrow-minded, petty, pompous Thing! What lent a feather to the boldest wing Of soaring Fancy,—but a praise when due? And wouldst thou hive it for the darling few? Though Shakspere sang, and Milton's soul aspired, Must Gray be scorn'd, nor Goldsmith be admired? As well might Ocean of the Earth demand To let no river roll, no stream expand; As well might Mountains which embrace the skies Entreat the heav'ns to let no hills arise! Eternal Spirit! while thy day-beams smile Around my path in many a sunny wile, Their shining truth, oh, let my gaze deny Ere merit sickens on mine envious eye: As ocean kindles to her native sun, As waters freshen when the wind's begun, So brightening, quickening—let my spirit feel Wisdom and genius in their just appeal! Such dimming shades, thou young Aspirer! wait On all who seek to glorify their state. But shouldst thou, wafted by a fearless gale, Ascend a height no vulgar clouds assail; Should Fame encrown thee, and thy mind suffuse O'er other minds its vivifying hues; Wake feeling, passion, and the pow'r sublime That bids eternity o'ershadow time, The sunny raptures of renown enjoy, But deem, oh! deem them not without alloy. The smile of Nations may illume thy fame, The good repeat, the glorious love thy name, Still, tongues of scorn, and words of venom'd pow'r To be the vipers of a secret hour, The petty tribute, and unfeeling phrase, Which nought but iciness of soul betrays,— Demand forgiveness in thy brightest reign; On ev'ry pleasure frowns the demon, pain! But deeper peril is the praise which gives That very light in which young Genius lives: A tyrant weakness is the worst to see, Since men are vain, yet all hate vanity; It has been said that Heaven, which gave great qualities only to a small number of its favourites, gave vanity to all, as a full compensation.—Brown's Philosophy. When safely felt, most insecurely shown, For who endures it, save it prove his own? Yet should that energy, whose quenchless ray Burns through the blackest and the brightest day, Intensely pure within thy spirit glow And colour dreams beyond the world to know; If, eagle-like, thy Spirit dare to soar On bolder wing than it had waved before; If virtue love, and wisdom greet thy strain, If this be vanity,—then still be vain! Oh! for a nobler and a deeper sense Of all which forms our true pre-eminence; For high-born energies of heav'nly sway, And flowers of charity to strew the way, That Sin no longer may the world defile And Nature glory in a good man's smile, As on we hasten to that dreamless Shore Where passion sleeps, and prejudice is o'er. The days of fever, and the nights of fire Felt in the blood, till health and hope expire; An aching slumber, and a spectral tomb For ever yawning in the spirit's gloom; And that most agonising waste of soul Where the deep currents of excitement roll Morn, noon, and night, in one eternal play, Are thine, Ambition!—till Thou wear'st away. And, mix'd with agonies of outward state, An inward torment which thy dreams create, Thirsting within for some perfection made By thought alone, or never yet display'd Like that pure model which the mind surveys,— 'Tis thine to suffer through uncounted days. Yet, welcome all! If ever thought of thine Hath woo'd a spirit into calm divine, Expanded feelings, purified their flow, Or shed a sunbeam o'er the hour of wo, Thy soul may triumph in exhaustless pain And proudly think it has not lived in vain! Ye midnight heavens, a Hand celestial hung, In ev'ry age by ev'ry poet sung, One parting glance, oh! let my spirit take Ere dawn-light on your awful beauty break. With what intensity the eye reveres Your starry legions, when their pomp appears! As though the glances Centuries have given Since dreams first wander'd o'er the vast of heav'n, Had left a magic where a myst'ry shone, Enchanting more, the more 'tis gazed upon! Stars, worlds, or wonders! whatsoe'er ye shine, The home of Angels, or the haunts divine Wherein the Bodiless from earth set free Shine in the blaze of present Deity, No eyes behold your ever-beaming ray But think, while earthly visions roll away, In placid immortality ye glow Above this chaos of terrestrial wo! Thy wings, Almighty! let them long o'er-shade A clime by Thee a matchless empire made; Here in meek glory may Thy temples stand While smiles from heav'n fall brightly o'er the land; And those pure Worlds that have for ages roll'd O'er Alma Mater, still her towers behold; Till time be dead, eternity begun, And darkness blacken round the dying Sun, The toils of life, the pangs of being o'er, Our doom completed, and the world no more.

Of Man's redemption by almighty Blood, When God incarnate on the earth became Apparent, and in bleeding glory died, I sing: O Thou! for Whom the worlds were made, Instruct me in this high attempt, and theme August of all-surpassing Love divine; That with no daring eye or step profane The Muse may wander where the Saviour trod: If e'er at morning, noon, or solemn night, Thy shadow on my soul hath been, or prayer Or praise before Thy hymnéd Throne prevail'd, Priest of the Universe! my song inspire. Ere Matter out of nothingness arose, Or, Time his destined march of years began, Himself was All! the unapparent God: But, Life the symbol of His Love appeared; He will'd a universe, and lo, it was! With Nature in her young excess of bloom Array'd, and with a living sense of joy Abroad upon the verdant face of things, How exquisite must earth's primeval state Have been, how tinted with the hues of heaven! And when amid it, from unbreathing dust A living Shape of godlike beauty rose, Alas! that e'er on such transcendent scene A shade of guilt could fall! that clouds advanced In wrath and darkness o'er offending Earth, No longer bright with angel-steps, but sad And stricken, trembling at her God! When Man as monarch of the globe was placed Where lavish Eden waved and smiled, erect He stood; but to his Maker homage due By test of one supreme command was tried. “Of every tree which in the garden grows All freely eat, save that, wherein of Good And Evil the forbidden knowledge lies; Whereof the day thou eatest,—thou shalt die!” A Tempter came, the interdicted Fruit Man dared to eat, and from his high estate Of sinless glory into darkness fell! In this black hour when evil Doom prevails, Shall finite teach the Infinite his ways Or shape the path Omnipotence shall tread? Shall man, in dreams of wild presumption, dare His Maker criticise, or blindly call Our fate unjust? Shall fancy, in her flight Insane, beyond the Empyréan soar, The God unthrone, His attributes affect, And fashion worlds to prove his wisdom wrong? Let Nature hope; and while her blessings thrive, To secret Heaven resign the dark unknown! A deathless soul, as imaging its God, In preciousness the jewell'd earth transcends; And when 'twas darken'd, vast Creation felt Its value, since the righteous Curse which came On ruin'd manhood, thrill'd all nature through, And round the world its dread vibration ran! Cited for judgment, then the Creature saw The Face Almighty robed in frowning ire Bent o'er him; and with sinking brow and frame While reel'd the ground whereon the trembler trod, Heard the dread fiat, which all time confirms,— “Dust since thou wert, to dust return and die!” Pale in the gloom of that departed Cloud, Whose shadow, like a lightning-track had scathed The bowers of Paradise, when Adam stood With eyes aghast, and view'd the forfeit-world Wither around him, while his fancy heard The Curse still rolling on the awe-struck wind, The dimness and the agony of doubt How terribly his fallen soul endured! For what forbade, but in the hour he sinn'd, By one annihilating word consumed That earth should perish in the pangs of hell? Oh! ye, who in the choir of Cherubim Divinely shaped, upon your sapphire-thrones Which in the palace of Jehovah blaze, One anthem of seraphic bliss prolong, My lyre attune, triumphantly to sing, Who sun-like dawn'd upon the gloom of death, Justice and mercy in His cross combined, And roll'd away God's thunders from the world! But say, hath ever hymn by Angel sung, Hath thought divined, or human voice express'd This miracle of miracles profound, A world redeem'd, and Christ redemption's Lord? I've seen the Sun, creation's paramount, Rise o'er the waves and lead the march of Day; Alone have mused, when tempest roof'd the heavens With blackness, and the quiring Ocean heard, When choral billows, as with conscious swell, Chanted loud anthems in the hush of night; The dark sublimity of deepest storms Hath girdled, and the glories of the sky O'erwhelm'd me: in humbleness and awe Before the majesty of human Worth I've bow'd, and felt how lovely Virtue is; But poor and powerless, dim and undefined, The adoration born of scenes or hours Below, to that which o'er the spirit comes, When silent, Lord! it thinks alone of Thee. In Christ all Revelation lives. His voice With man in Eden dread communion held, To teach him morning-vow, or evening-prayer, Or sacrifice divine: the shadowy Type, The mystic Law, and sacramental Powers, To Him relate: and when thy desert rang O Sinai! with the battle-hymns of old, While Judah's banners in victorious play Flouted the vassal wind, the Lord o'erhung The travell'd wilderness; a signal-Cloud By day and night His awful guidance led: And Horeb heard Him; when, in lightning veil'd, Her giant form beneath His thunder bow'd, As high o'er all the dreadful trumpet clang'd With heaven-toned music, till the Desert shook. That Wilderness! oh, when hath mind conceived Magnificence beyond a midnight there, When Israel paused, and o'er her tented host The moonlight lay? On yonder palmy mount, Lo, sleeping myriads in the dewy hush Of night repose: around, in squared array, The camps are set; and in the midst, apart, That curtain'd Shrine where mystically dwells Jehovah's presence: through the soundless air A cloudy pillar, robed in burning light, Appears; concentered as one mighty heart A million lie, in mutest slumber bound, Or, panting like the Ocean when a dream Of storm awakes her. Heaven and Earth are still: In radiant loveliness the Stars pursue Their pilgrimage, while moonlight's wizard hand Throws beauty, like a spectre-light, on all. At Judah's tent the lion-banner stands Upfolded, and the pacing sentinels,— What awe pervades them, when the dusky groves, The rocks Titanian, by the moonshine made Unearthly, or yon mountains vast, they view! But soon as morning bids the sky exult, As earth from nothing, so that countless host From slumber and from silence will awake To mighty being: while the forest-birds Rush into song, the matin-breezes play, And streamlets flash where roving sunbeams fall. Like clouds in lustre, banners will unroll, The trumpet shout, the warlike tramp resound, And hymns of valour from the marching Tribes Ascend, to gratulate the risen Morn. Though Mercy, when a malediction fell On Life and Matter from the lips of God, That Woman's seed should bruise the Serpent's head Predicted, still, in ghastly vision came The shadows of thy then unenter'd world O Death! but time hath half thy gloom unveil'd. Though yet invisible, no more thy realm A desert seems where nothing human dwells: By ages peopled, 'tis the haunt of Dreams Forsaking earth, to roam and muse awhile With Shapes of being, who did once imbibe The vital breath. There, ancient Seers exist, Whose words were mightier than thunder-tones When Nature trembles; there, the Good abide, The glorious, gifted, and immortal are. And who of death would all oblivious be When friends are tomb'd, and parents smile no more? To loved eternity where they repose The orphan wanders in parental dreams How often, and the widow calls it, Home! Yet 'twas not thus, when new-created Earth From chaos rose, with deepest verdure clad: Flower, fruit, and tree, in primal beauty waved; No tint of death, no touch of sad decay Then marr'd the freshness of the lovely scene. Hence, the dread fiat, “Perish! dust thou art, And unto dust shalt thou again return,” To Adam sounded like Creation's knell! Upon the wide and voiceless world, alone The guilty wanderers, whom fair Eden once Embower'd, in fond remembrance often mourn'd The bloom of Paradise, and pure estate For ever lost. The Morning rose, and light Around them in its warm luxuriance fell; But ah! it could not through the spirit beam As once, when Day and Heaven together rose, While harping angels on the breezes sang: And Evening, with her tenderness of shade O'ercame them, like a cloud of solemn grief; For then, of Paradise and dewy calm They thought, as there they watch'd the vesper-hues In beautiful consumption fade and die, All innocently blest. Thus pass'd the day In wo; and dreams of sworded Cherubim Glared on their slumber! still, their God was near; And when the pangs which only mothers feel Dejected Eve endured, and lo! a child Was born, th' unclouded spring of hope began. And who can fathom that deep hour of love When first an infant on its mother smiled, And in the bright enchantment of that bliss Her babe she clasp'd, and to Jehovah cried, “The promised Seed! Almighty! now 'tis born!” Thus dimly on the world's primeval state Messiah dawn'd; till God himself declared To sainted Abram, as the countless orbs Of midnight glitter'd over Hebron's plain, That like yon stars a glorious race should rise Unnumber'd, till the earth's Deliverer came, And crown'd all nations blest. Then, Isaac rose, The child of promise, the Redeemer's type On the stern altar by his parent laid! The son, the only son, whom Abram loved Yet did not spare, when Heaven commanded, “Slay!” Ere the rich morning on the mountains flung A robe of beauty; in that vestal hour When birds are darting from the dewy ground, And nature, soft as sleeping life, begins To waken, and the spell of day to wear, Unseen the patriarch and his cherish'd boy Uprose, the sacrificial wood prepared, And thus, companion'd by his household-youths, They onward journey'd with the laden ass. Through piny glens, and green acacia-vales The pilgrims wound their undulating way. Oft as he went, upon his child beloved The Sire of nations look'd, and inly pray'd; And felt the father in his bosom rise, As bound and bloody, on the altar stretch'd He vision'd him!—the long-hoped, destined son Who fond and dutiful had ever been, And guiltless of a parent's tear. But, faith Triumphant in the power of mercy proved. Twice had the Sun around the pilgrims drawn His evening-veil, when o'er a distant mount, Upon Moriah's steep and rocky clime A Vision of the Lord reposed, and shone,— A cloudy signal, shaped for Abram's eye Alone to see, and there his altar raise. The patriarch bow'd; and o'er the mountain-path Both child and parent took their solemn way, But each was silent, for they thought of Heaven. Thus on they went, till at the mount ordain'd Arriving, with enamour'd gaze they saw Green heights, and forest-crested hills afar, And willow'd plains; and drank the balmy air, And cool'd their foreheads in the breeze, which play'd Like the soft tremor of an angel-wing; So hush'd the hour, the spot so calm, that God Himself seem'd waiting there to welcome man! Then Isaac, as the stony altar-pile Beneath the shadow of a mountain-tree Was reared, and sacramental fire prepared, In words of unsuspecting sweetness cried, “My father!”—Abram answer'd, “Here, my son!” “The wood and fire behold! but where the lamb Of sacrifice, to crown yon flaming pyre?” Then heaved his bosom with the love of years Departed; and a tear paternal rose As gazed he fondly on that only child, And far away a childless mother saw Whose heart had echoed every infant-cry! But soon the strife, and soon the tear was o'er: To Heaven he look'd, and thus to Isaac spake: “My son! in thee a sacrifice the Lord Hath found, and—thou to God art dedicate!” He answer'd not; but meekly knelt him down And on the altar lay, a willing Lamb. But God descended; and the hand uplift In glorious faith to sacrifice a child, Was holden, while angelic tones proclaim'd “O Abram! spare thy son! thine only spare, And let him live, for thou art faithful found.” With thrilling wonder and ecstatic awe Up look'd the Patriarch, and behold! a ram Beside him, in a woody thicket caught: And while it bled, again the Voice sublime Repeated, like the sound of golden waves, “In blessing I will bless thee; and thy seed The sand of ocean shall outnumber far, And from it spring the Glory of the World!” But next, on Jacob, in symbolic dream The Incarnation dawn'd, as lone and sad, His couch the earth, his canopy the skies, The exiled patriarch from wild Esau fled. When night had deepen'd, homeless, pale, and worn, The wanderer, pillow'd on a stone-built couch, For slumber stretch'd him on the dreary plain. Companionless he was, 'mid forests dark With midnight-umbrage, torn by wolfish winds, And echoed by the frequent lion-roar Howl'd from the hills; but God he ever felt; And round his heart parental blessings twined, Till sleep came o'er him, like a smile from Heaven. Rude was the couch, but oh! his angel-dream To witness, Saints would now a ruder share! He dreamt; and lo! a Ladder, based on earth, And buried in the sky, before him rose; Adown it Shapes of awful beauty stole, While others clad with archangelic beams Did solemnly from step to step ascend: Above, a formless Apparition shone, Ineffable! from Whom a voice divine In accent richer than the full-toned sea, Proclaim'd, “Thy father's God! and thine, behold! Wide o'er the world thy destined seed will spread, And, numberless, empeople lands and isles, Till One arise, and make all kingdoms blest.” “How dreadful! 'tis the gate of heaven!” he cried: 'Mid solemn breathings of melodious air Aloft then moved the hierarchal Pomp; And ere the lark to hymn the Day began The exile rose, a rocky pillar raised, Shed o'er its top the consecrating oil, And in the hush of morning hied away. “From Judah's hand the sceptre shall not fall, Till Shiloh come; to Him shall Empires bow!” So spake a patriarch from his couch of death; And thus, through all the realm of holy Writ, Messiah is the Morning Star of Hope Who beams for ever on the soul of truth. But, ere deep Prophecy its organ-strain Its full magnificence of tone begin, A vision of that unforgotten prime The patriarchal age, when Earth was young, Awhile, oh! let it linger. On the soul It breaketh, like a lovely burst of spring On gazing captives, when the open skies Again are floating over Freedom's head. Though sin had wither'd with a charnel-breath Creation's morning-bloom, there still remain'd Elysian hues of that angelic scene When the Sun gloried o'er a sinless world, And with each ray produced a flower. From dells Untrodden, hark! the breezy carol comes Upwafted, with the chant of radiant birds; While meadows, bathed in greenest light, and woods Gigantic, towering from the skiey hills, And odorous trees in prodigal array, With all the elements divinely calm, Our fancy pictures on the infant globe. And ah, how godlike, with imperial brow Benignly grave, yon patriarchal Forms Tread the free earth, and eye the naked heavens! In nature's stamp of unassisted grace Each limb is moulded; simple as the mind The vest they wear; and not a hand but works, Or, tills the ground with honourable toil. By youth revered, their sons around them grow And flourish; monarch of his pastoral tribe, A Patriarch's throne is each devoted heart; And when he slumbers on the tented plain Beneath the vigil-stars, a living wall Is round him, in the might of love's defence. And he is worthy: sacrifice and song By him are ruled; and oft at shut of flowers When queenly virgins in the sunset go Water to carry from the crystal wells, In beautiful content, beneath a tree Whose shadows hung o'er many a hallow'd sire, He sits; recording how Creation rose From nothing, of the Word almighty born; How man had fallen, and where Eden-boughs Had waved their beauty on the breeze of morn; Or, how the Angels still at twilight love To visit Earth with errands from the Sky. But like a river that its course renews, Again my song to its high Theme returns. When Balak, frighted by the banner'd hosts Of Israel, camping on unbounded plains, For Balaam sent, upon his trancèd eye Prophetic visions from th' Almighty fell. There, when the monarch on the mountain stood, Seven altars, oxen, and seven rams prepared, And sacrifice of mystic numbers paid,— The Seer his oracle of light unroll'd. He look'd, and lo! along that river'd vale Where Arnon glitter'd, shone the myriad tents Of Judah, whitening in the lustrous air, Like clouds which congregate on summer-sky In ranks of infinite and fresh array: Then, all the chords of Heaven's predictive lyre Quiver'd, with more than melody intoned, And superhuman Poetry began! His curse was buried in the bliss foretold; While glory, blessing, and mysterious joy The tents of Jacob from the prophet drew: Till Ecstacy this higher strain attuned In—“I shall see Him, but not now! a Star From Jacob, and from Israel shall arise A Sceptre, in whose shadow will depart Thy race and region, O deserted king!” Thus Prophecy to man from heaven was breathed A miracle beyond all utterance deep, Immeasurably vast; outmarching Time, Subduing Space, and with colossal might Erecting Thrones; or crushing city-walls With curses, like the winds when desert-born, Terrific, loud, with desolation wing'd! And they, elected to be Mouths for God, Dread Oracles! whose dooming words have blanch'd The cheek of Empires in their godless pride And palsied high-domed Capitals with fear, August and lonely, sad, yet all sublime They lived, in sackcloth robed, in deserts housed Or mountain cavern; fated, and apart From blinding shadows of terrestrial sway, They dwelt, communing with almighty Thought. The gloom, the glory, and the Vision came, The Future rendered voiceless secrets up, And then, like phantoms, from eternity, Dim Ages rose, and answered to their Spell! And he, whose sorrow was sublimely borne, Whose grief was glory, for it made the soul A witness how the Everlasting thinks,— Behold him! on the ashy ground reclined. Seven days and nights have o'er his throbbing head Departed, still, in mutest wo he bows With three beside him. Oft when darkness rose, A groan sank dreary on the midnight-air; But, soon his agony again retired Back to the gulph of unlamenting gloom! Nor lip, nor limb his inward strife reveals; Despair in stone was not more dumb than he! Prometheus, chain'd on Scythia's burning rock, When lightning, tempest, and Tartarean ire With thund'ring earthquake round his martyr'd frame The tragedy of Nature's wreck begun, In full sublimity of godlike wo Was less exalted than the silent Job. And, what a lesson of undying truth The torture of the Scene supplies! Array'd In whirlwind, did the vocal God declare Secrets of glory, or mysterious depths Of Essence Infinite to man unshroud? No! sea and mountain, thunder-storm and cloud, The glorious miracles of life and form Which float the waters, or the earth command, These are but types of Trinitarian power, Yet, who the mystery of their being knows? Lost in the march of God's material ways, If Reason wander, how could thought abstract His moral Kingdom perfectly conceive? To question deeply what we darkly know, Our boding fancies in their raven flight Cross and re-cross a universe of gloom, And yet, in this appall'd conviction ends,— That God is good, and infinite, and wise, But Man a daring antichrist, who dreams Himself the measure of Eternal Mind! When Nature, in her awful doubt, creates Mystery and madness for the heart and brain, From all which life endures, let mortals feel That man, the infant of eternity, By wo is nursed, and strengthen'd for the skies; And a brave soul, though Earth and Hell combine To scatter tempest round its blighted way, Beholds a God in all things but despair! In hours of sadness, when Oppression rules, And each pale sunburst of unwonted joy Breaks o'er the spirit, like derisive beams Of summer playing round a wintry realm, Let Grief remember how the patriarch cried With voice that travell'd o'er the sea of Time, “Oh! that the graven rock my words imprest, And iron stamp'd them with eternal truth! For though in dust my body be dissolved, That my Redemer liveth, and shall stand When time is ended, on this mortal earth, I surely know: on Him mine eye shall gaze, And in my flesh shall I The Lord behold!” God's Incarnation is the focal truth Where prophecy's converging beams unite. And Thou! the shepherd-king, of Jesse born, Of Heaven beloved, similitude express Of Christ, the Lord of everlasting worlds, Whether on Zion hill thy holy strain Be harped, or by the brook of Kedron hymn'd; Or nightly warbled, when unnumber'd orbs To thee their origin divine declared,— Thy words are breathings by the soul attuned; For aye thou seem'st a Singer from above Who chants the glory of remember'd skies. Wouldst thou in meekest adoration bend, Or mount the heavens, and with bright myriads swell The chorus of eternity? Does Grief Around thee blacken in her stormy ire, Or sad dejection on thy eyelids weigh? The royal minstrel hath a mood for thee And in his heart deep echoes for thine own! But when the frame of this majestic World The mind o'erawes, then! who like him appeals To clouds and whirlwinds, with the Thunder talks, Partakes the tempest, and of Ocean learns Such mimicry sublime, that Fancy hears In God's own orchestra of waves and winds The billows, echoed by his heaven-strung lyre. But Nature in her gentleness, alike From David woos a sympathy divine. The lull of night, the language of the stars, And all that beautiful, serene, or blest Is deemed, his harp melodiously inspires. Bard of the Spirit! thine heroic song, Whose hallelujahs in Engeddi's cave, Or forest glens, and palmy grove, prevail'd O'er every pang his exiled bosom felt,— Attunes Religion's universal voice. Canadian forests, or the parchèd wilds Of Afric, ocean-rocks, and cavern-gloom, Wherever Man to God in prayer ascends, Thy melodies the yearning heart relieve. And oh! what blessings have thy hymns evoked From Heaven's vast treasury of light and love Since first they sounded on a shepherd's lyre! For they are all Imagination dreams Angelic lips might warble:—on the Cross Of Calvary, ere the Son of Man dismiss'd His martyr'd spirit, thine was His farewell! But chief o'er all in David's glorious strain, The homage wafted to that destined Throne Whereon would reign a universal King From him descended:—in his darksome wo The Martyr and the Maker of our world Was symbolised, beneath a veiling gloom. And when exalted, his far-reaching eye By heaven unscaled, in emblematic light Foreshadowed Him, the Triumpher o'er death, And Victor of the grave. Thus, vision-blest, The prophet-minstrel all divinely sung; Thus rose from mortal to immortal themes, Above his nature tower'd, and hail'd on high Christ from eternity by God decreed The earth to ransom and mankind restore. And how he imageth the Lord of souls Before us, when he mounteth on the wings Of rapture, soaring through the heaven of heavens! “From Zion shall He wither in His wrath Rebellious kings! to me hath He declared, My Son thou art! this day Jehovah hath Begotten Thee; the heathen are Thine own, And vanquish'd worlds beneath Thy sceptre bow!” But when the starry hush and pomp of night O'erawed him, and the moon her Maker's hand Confess'd, the spirit of prophetic Truth Again was vocal: thus the minstrel sang: “When I consider how the balanced heavens Almightiness in moving pomp reveal, Lord! what is man? yet Him hast thou encrown'd; Upon the deep his vast dominion walks, And subject earth beneath his sceptre bows. “Ever before me lives the Lord of Hosts! His hand o'ershades me, and my heart exults: And soaring hope, by inspiration plumed, Wings o'er the sepulchre its flight,—for there A Soul shall triumph; and thy Holy One No dark corruption of the dead shall stain!” “How beauteous Thou, above the sons of men! Upon Thy lips what loveliness diffused! Array Thee in thy glory! gird Thy sword Upon thy thigh; majestically ride! Hark! Earth is quaking; her foundations rock, Thine arrows thicken; terrible Thy sway! For ever and for ever is Thy Throne, And righteously Thy boundless sceptre rules, And over all Thy God anoints Thee great. “Through dateless ages are Thy years unroll'd; The earth was founded, and the heavens were arch'd By Thee; Creation felt Thy forming hand; But while they perish, Thou shalt aye endure: When, like a vesture, they are changed and gone Still, Thou art One, Eternal and the True!” And thus did Zion's royal minstrel chant, And through the cloud of unaccomplish'd time His glance direct, to that transcendent reign Of Mercy, when the veil would be uproll'd And brightly dawn th' Incarnate Sun of Worlds. Next in the train of these immortal Seers Another of the heaven-directed hail; Who, like the clarion that shall rouse the dead, Might quicken dust,—such life his song inspires! Amid a temple, bright as Syrian noon, Upon a Throne unutterably high O'er which the six-wing'd Seraphim appear'd, The Lord was seated; and the awful cry Of “Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord!” Melodious came from each seraphic lip: And in that Vision, as a centre stood Appall'd Isaiah, seeing, hearing all. Terrific Bard, and mighty! in thy strain The passion and the poetry of truth And deep-toned storms of inspiration roll, Whether for cities by th' Almighty cursed Thy wail arose; or, on enormous crimes Which darken'd heaven with supernatural gloom, Thy flash of indignation fell, alike The feelings quiver when thy Voice awakes! Borne in the whirlwind of a dreadful song Our spirit travels round the destined globe, While shadows, cast from solemn years to come, Fall round us, and we feel a God is nigh! But when a gladness from thy music flows, Creation brightens; glory decks the sky, The Sun is mantled with millennial smiles And green earth temper'd for immortal spring: The lion smoothes his ruffled mane, the lamb!— And wolf together feed, and by the den Of serpents, see the rosy infant play! There is a Day, the darkness of whose scene In visitings of dread might well subdue The world's false brightness, foreordained to come, When the huge fabric of this stately Globe Shall bow with terror in the storm of doom. Then, in that hour of chaos, while the earth And heaven shall fade like elemental dreams, High on some rocky eminence enthroned Methinks Isaiah might his voice awake In bursts of wo magnificently wild,— The last that lingers round a dying World! But, Prince of Prophets! in thy page eterne, How visibly the Son of God appears! “Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear A son; Immanuel shall his name be call'd.” Again;—“For unto us a Child is born, To us a Son is given; and his name Is, Wonderful, the Everlasting Prince Of Peace! the Counsellor, and mighty God! “A Voice comes wafted through the Wilderness! Prepare the way, and be the Desert smooth: Arise, ye valleys! and ye mountains, sink Before Him! for the Lord Jehovah comes! “Despised, rejected, and a Man with grief Acquainted, surely He our woes hath borne, And in His bosom all our sorrows ta'en! Our chastisement is on Him: we are heal'd, But He is wounded! and on Him alone The Lord hath laid th' iniquity of all!” Nor, when captivity by Chebar mourn'd, And Israel wore the Babylonian chain Beside the willow-shaded streams, was dumb The Voice prophetic: but where Belus rose In her stupendous prodigy of towers, Ezekiel pour'd his passionate lament; Or shaped for time the Destinies he saw From heaven prefigured:—what colossal shades As though reflected from the scenes immense Around him, crowd upon his fated world! But high o'er all the visionary Pomp To us the Cedar of the Gospel rears Its allegoric boughs, beneath whose shade Birds of all clime, and wing, and beauty dwell. So Daniel, when his midnight-trance began On the dim bosom of that mystic Sea Whose waters quiver'd in the tempest-grasp, Beheld him, coming with the clouds of heaven,— The Son of Man; then, throned in flaming pomp With myriads of Angelic Forms begirt, Perpetual empire to the Son was given O'er land and language, kingdom, sea, and isle. And thus, wherever bright prediction beams, The glories of the Incarnation dawn. At last, with healing on his wings, arose The Sun of Righteousness, to him who cried, “Before the splendour of that dreadful day A Herald of the Lord, Elijah comes, To turn thy heart, O guilty world! to me, Or thou shalt wither in My blast of ire!” So Prophecy, with time begun, with time Shall end; and when in some empyreal Sphere The mind expands with far sublimer reach Than prescient faith, or fancy can extend, In proud fulfilment Prophecy will reign. For, having grasp'd the glory of the world Redeem'd, and taught us how Millennium smiles, Beyond the Universe of sense it wings An awful flight, and in mysterious depths Of Being unexplored, for man foredooms, A state unspeakably divine and pure,— Eternity, O God! and shared with Thee. Almighty Priest! Thou angel-worshipp'd Lord In secrecies of uncreated Light Though now enthron'd, Thy sympathies retain Their human oneness with Thy People still; And, for the Church, thy Mystic Body call'd, Plead and prevail with eloquence divine. As oft in chamber dim, or lonesome walk By leafy twilight arch'd, the Mind foreviews Its own eternity, and dreams Thy Form To life again,—how wonderful, apart, By time unsoil'd, by accident, or sin Immaculate as Love and Law required Thy Being riseth in irradiant truth, Before us, purer than the light of light, Of all Transcendencies the sum and soul! And when did Earth Thine attribute display,— One vast Benevolence, which girt a world Of hearts by catholic embrace of love? All time and truth, all empires and all powers That were, or would be, in the march of fate, By Thee were compass'd for Redemption's plan! When o'er the grandeur of unclouded heaven Our vision travels with a free delight, As though the boundless and the pure were made For speculation, so the towering mind By inward oracle inspired and taught, The Lofty and the Excellent in mind reveres; And thus, the Incarnation of divinest love, God's perfect Image, humanised for Man, As Finite loved, as Infinite adored, Messiah is; and hence to faith presents A Model for the Universe.—Though God Be round us, by the shadow of His might For aye reflected; and with plastic Hand Prints on the earth the character of Things; Yet He Himself,—how awfully retired Depth within depth, unutterably deep! His Glory brighter than the brightest thought Can image, holier than our holiest awe Can worship—utter'd only in, I AM! But Thou! apparell'd in a robe of true Mortality; meek Sharer of our low Estate, in all except compliant sin, To Thee can sacrificial Awe devote A living holocaust of sense and soul By love enkindled. Thou hast lived and breathed; Our wants and woes partaken; all that charms Regenerate hearts to Thine unspotted truth May plead for sanction; Virtue but reflects Thine image; Wisdom is a voice attuned To consonance with Thine; and all which yields To Thought a pureness, or to Life a peace, From Thee descends; whose spirit-ruling sway, Invisible as thought, around us brings A balm almighty for Affliction's hour. Once felt, in all the fulness of Thy grace The mystic essence of our moral life To form,—and heaven by holiness begins! Which purifies the base, the dark illumes, And binds our being with that holy spell Whereby each function, faculty, and thought Surrenders meekly to the central Guide Of hope and action, by a God empower'd. Until the eyelids of the Dead unclose Though Christ has vanish'd into viewless light, High o'er the world, beyond heroic state, To reach or rival, is Man's inner-life Securely founded on the Rock of faith! All the wide glories which the eye commands, Or air and ocean, earth and heaven supply, Of Him report, whose potency begat Them all. The ground is hallow'd, for 'twas trod By Him; all Earth is radiant with a sense Ethereal, born of His remember'd sway: Nor pang, nor trial, torture, grief, nor care Communion high and mystic interchange With Him destroys; in solitude alike, As in the roaring capital, a Saint Embodies into human Form again That living Saviour, Whom the Past perceived And worshipp'd, angels gloried to announce, And Whose perfections so harmonious are That o'er them God's eternal sabbath smiles. BOOK II. “The intellectual Power, through words and things, Went sounding on, a dim and perilous way.” Wordsworth. “Melior origo nos expectat, alius rerum status. Dies iste, quem tanquam extremum reformidas, æterni natalis est.”—Seneca, Epist. 102. ANALYSIS OF BOOK II. Having shown that the gradual announcement of an Incarnate Redeemer was the primary object of the Prophetic Scheme, the Second Book is principally devoted to a consideration of the necessity and probability of a Revelation from God, by an argument drawn from the nature of the human mind and the destinies of man. Natural and Revealed Religion—The total inadequacy of the former is endeavoured to be shown by exhibiting a mind most exquisitely attuned to the glories and harmonies of the Universe, yet averse to the truth and character of Christ's atonement; till, finally convinced, by the utter helplessness of human philosophy, it reposes in the Faith which is from Heaven—The probability of a Revelation from God, induced from the weakness, obscurity, and impotence of ancient systems, and the frequent longing of their founders for some certain Lawgiver from above—The Doctrine of Pagan and Christian Philosophy—Sublime superiority of the latter—Its triumphant effects—This Revelation was gradually made, in analogy with the progressive tendencies of the human mind, and the Divine arrangements from the commencement of the World—Belief by compulsion would violate the freedom of the will, and reduce the character of man to an irresponsible nature—Christ—Revelation extends through all ages—Apostrophe to England as a country gloriously distinguished by the ameliorating influence of Christianity—Her Sabbaths—Prayers for the diffusion of the Gospel—And our Country's efforts in this holy toil—Concluding thoughts, sentiments, and descriptive associations. There is a God, the Universe exclaims: There is a God, Man's echoing heart replies, And round the world that heaven-born answer rolls! And thus Creation, while the spirit throbs In full response to her sublime appeal, Hath canonised Imagination's creed, Till all her splendours to the soul become The faint reflections of a Vast Unseen! Yet, vainly beautiful this god of earth Whom Nature's worship for the soul creates: Our homage is material; and the mind, While in the light of elemental pomp It lives and moves, may still its darkness keep; Unvisited by that perpetual ray Of Truth divine, from revelation born, Where God a Person, not Abstraction is, And His high Attributes to faith become That inward Decalogue the will obeys. There is a haunt whose quietude of scene Accordeth well with hours of solemn hue,— A church-yard, bosomed in a beauteous vale Besprinkled o'er with green and countless graves, And mossy tombs of unambitious pomp Decaying into dust again. No step Of mirth, no laughter of unfeeling life Amid the calm of death that spot profanes. The skies o'er-arch it with serenest love; The winds, when visiting the dark-bough'd elms, An airy anthem sing; and birds and bees That in their innocence of summer joy Exult, and carol with commingling glee, But add to solitude the lull of sound. By sea environ'd, yet the choral waves By noon entranced, in dreaming slumber lie; And when roused Ocean at the roaring blast Foams in loud fury, still, the deep-toned storm Mellow'd by distance, into music dies Like that which echoes from the world afar, Or lingers round the path of perish'd Years. And here, companion'd by his soul alone, A Being, whose unfathom'd spirit fought With Loneliness, did wander oft and muse His hours away; while dream-wove spells entwined Their mystery round him:—if the Tomb its dead Surrender'd, well might he arise and prove How frail the creed which erring Nature moulds When darkness rushes on the doom of Man! In vain the witchery of words would tell How fondly, by impassion'd dreams inspired, His fancy wed the Universe with love. The hues and harmonies of blended Things Were beauty to the magic of his mind; And all the thousand wheels of moving life The intellectual melodies, which played For ever on the mystic harp of Thought. Such warm imaginings, where'er he came, A glittering falseness on the true and stern Suffused; and through the light of feeling shone The scene of earth, and countenance of heaven. The young enchantment of angelic Spring Flow'd in his veins, voluptuously deep; The budding infancy of flowers was dear To him, nor would he tread their life away; Nor wander in the soundless gloom of dell Or grove, without a sympathetic hush. And oh! to view him when the balmy night Breathed o'er this quiet world, and from her throne The lustrous Moon on tree and temple pour'd The pallid radiance of her peaceful smile,— In second paradise he seem'd to muse, Priested by Sentiment, to worship there! So lived, so felt he; making all without Enchantment for responsive thought within; But that Eternity which girdles time, Majestic Faith, and everlasting Hope, Commoved not him: Hereafter drown'd his soul In seas of darkness, billowing with doubt And fear!—That this divine, all-beauteous Orb Whose faintest impulse, sent from breeze or star, So thrillingly his heart confess'd, was framed, Upheld, and circled through the void profound By Power apart, invisibly enthroned, His innate majesty of mind declared. But such a god, of dreams and shadows born, No bended knee, no voice nor vow adored: He was—a Spirit, or pervading Sense, A sightless Agent, an almighty Self Articulated by the tones of Earth And gloriously by nature's pomp reveal'd,— So fancy dreamt; and Feeling taught no more. And hence did Pride and Passion, which imbue Mortality with taints of sin and wo And colour all the atmosphere of life With clouds of awful gloom, work unrestrain'd, And rule or sanction the decrees of Thought. At length Affliction, in whose teaching gloom The keen-eyed jealousy of Guilt beholds Truths which our mental Cains deny, or dread, Blighted his home with desolating blast! And One, the beatings of whose heart were his Re-echo'd, she who walk'd with angel-step, Her looks the living sunshine of his soul, Her tones the music of his memory, Whose printless foot made consecrated ground, The hope and heaven of all,—lay still in death! Then came that worldless, dread, eclipse of mind, The agony which curdles soul and sense As though annihilation had begun, Or man were mouldering into dust again! One beam of heaven had brought salvation now; But Darkness girt him with its deepest shroud, Wherein he stood, nor wept, nor spoke, nor sigh'd, But, mute and stone-like, turn'd to cold despair! With tender rudeness to his couch they bore The widow'd martyr; day by day, and hour By hour, Affection with her heavenly eye Attended, faintly smooth'd his pallid brow, Then touch'd his hand, and with a yearning gaze Woo'd his dumb anguish into speaking life, Which came at last; and then, alone he nursed His sorrow;—in the breathless noon of night, All unperceived, the lovely dead he found; There stood, and gazed, enamour'd of the grief That, now unfrozen, from his spirit pour'd Tears fast and free, in all the storm of wo! On that cold form, so spiritually pale, Where the lone night-watch flung a spectral gleam, He look'd, as though a life were in that look Absorb'd, and felt that never more would flash From pulseless clay revealings of the soul! The mystery of Being was fulfill'd, The seal of Nature set, the vision gone, Or vanish'd in some universe of gloom! And yet, from dreams a Light immortal soothed The mourner, when from out the grave he saw An Apparition, bright as golden air, Ascend, assume her own appealing smile And point with waving hand to better worlds! But Life no longer seem'd the living sense Of mortal nature; but a ghastly dream Wherein he moved, by Destiny compell'd. A dismal trance of dull satiety This lone world grew; a dampness of despair, The sullen winter of a broken heart Was all he felt,—was all he wish'd to feel! A demon-shadow, by his anguish bred, O'er all things brooded: in the light no light Appear'd; e'en melody no music brought, And earth emaciate as an orb of death To him became; his thoughts alone did live; And these, like pulses from a tortured brain, Throbb'd in the spirit with eternal pang! And now, the poison of dejection work'd; His cheeks were blighted; o'er his thin-worn hands The veins meander'd with a dying hue; The mournful hair that arch'd his manly brow Droop'd like decaying locks; his bright eye lost The boldness of expressive fire, and grew Unearthly, from its depth of lifeless gaze: And oft did mothers heave maternal sighs, And children cease their revel, when he pass'd Unheedful by them, like a Shape from tombs. At length, the unbeliever sought the Night To tell him secrets of eternity. And then, how terrible the spirit-throes Of doubting agony a Deist felt! Above him,—the majestic sea of heaven Where island-orbs of beauty sail'd and shone; Around him, dimness and the calm of death By nothing marr'd, but when some moving branch Of cypress, like a dying billow shed A faint sound on the feeble wind.—Intense And deep, and passionate the gaze he sent Far in the blue infinity of night! Oh, let some Angel on his wings of love Be wafted, and the burning doubt which preys On sorrow with permitted voice subdue! He listen'd!—on the air a faded leaf Fell slowly, with a sad and ling'ring sound Whose tone seem'd not of earth; but soon it still'd: And then, the midnight of despair return'd, And in the blackness of his heart he wish'd Eternal nothingness his tomb to be! An hour there came from heaven at last, when Faith Look'd up, and view'd her God.—As evening smiled On ocean's western brim, where molten waves A restless glory of rich waters made, A pensive wanderer, on the pebbled beach He stood, communing with the conscious Scene. Where'er his feeling glance reposed, a charm There glow'd, which told Almightiness had touch'd The world; and when the folding clouds enwreath'd The Day-god on his sunset-throne, and cool And calm the unimpassion'd Twilight rose, That purity of second childhood came Whose tenderness is truth.—In such meek hour When darkness from the soul dissolves away, With gentle step and gentler mien approach'd A hoary Sage, by hallow'd wisdom blest. The balmy light, the beauty and romance Of scene, well harmonised with heavenly thought. And hence, the solemn Teacher on his soul The dews of immortality distill'd:— Not hiding Mercy in dogmatic gloom, Or, led by light presumingly inspired, Outvent'ring on the mystic waves which roll Between us, and the shore of worlds unseen; But, meekly firm, of everlasting Love, Creative power, and providential Truth That Christian spake; and leaf by leaf the Book Of Man's redemption from primeval wo Unroll'd, and challenged wide Creation's law To prove, how Nature visioneth the plan Which God himself descended to reveal. With soften'd eye, and brow intently sad, Such theme of glory did the sceptic hear, Yet answer'd not; but look'd to heaven, and sigh'd. Now twilight into solemn gloom retired; The pomp of clouds was o'er; and ocean lay In floating darkness round the rock-hewn beach; But here and there prevailing starlight gleam'd On some excited billow: deep the hour And holier the scene, as each, immersed In contemplation, track'd his homeward way; Unvoiced their feelings, and their thoughts unknown: But Heaven had watch'd them; and ere shrouding night Mantled the earth, an unbeliever pray'd!— When years had vanish'd, and converted mind Lived in the light of Deity, and knew The depths of God's redeeming love, how look'd The Infidel on what his heart had been? Go! ask some martyr of a dungeon-gloom, How fresh the light, how beautiful the airs Of heaven which visit his reviving frame, And he shall tell thee, what the mourner felt When broke the clouds from his benighted soul And Morn, eternal Morn, began to smile! So weak is all unaided Nature lends To educate the restless soul of man, Or solace wo, or subjugate the will To Conscience, on whose throne dread Justice reigns. Became it not, then, that almighty Love From Whom did emanate this wondrous world, The silence of eternity to break, Become apparent, and His Name divulge That mortals might draw near Him, and adore? Could He, to whom the universe of life From wave and wind a hymn of worship sends, Let Man alone be ignorantly dumb, Or mock by Superstition's jarring creed The awful witness of the God within? And, did not Man himself, of old, secure By feign'd communion with celestial Pow'rs, Profound dominion for the sacred rites That reach us from the past? In wood, or grove, And cave orac'lar, Legislation knew From Heaven to find a sanction and a strength Reveal'd; and long'd for Deity by truth Declared, and by celestial faith adored. Thus Plato, in his pure ambition, nursed A glorious longing for supremer Mind, The soul to tune, and teach him perfect Law. The past survey, and what hath Reason done? Passion and Doubt her waning light withstood: And stubborn ages, as they swept along, But mock'd her impotence with blind misrule, Of creed, or crime begot. Man look'd abroad, And on his spirit rush'd one vast belief! From life and matter, from the sun and moon And the deep waters did a power appeal, Attesting God, and teaching His domain; But how to worship, how His law obey, In vain would philosophic Reason find In pensive shade, or Academic bower. The World was deified; terrestrial gods In all that pantheistic Sense believed, A mystic reign for adoration held: Thus, Neptune on his ocean-car appear'd, Apollo gloried in the realm of light, And Dian, with her starry nymphs begirt, The virgin Moon inspired. No wind there breathed, There waved no grove, no fountain-music play'd, No River roll'd in liquid joy along, But Superstition lent a listening ear To hail her fancied god; each City claim'd Presiding deities, and built her fanes For monsters imaged out of monstrous thought, Where dark Pollution fed her secret fires. At length, Idolatry the mind subdued; From tombs evoked the undeserving Dead, Or, round the statues of her living great In sycophantic homage knelt, and pray'd. Religion thus in clouds of error lost, Morality no saving charm possess'd To harmonise the wheels of social life. The world without, to that far mightier world Within, a secondary station held, And action was alone the source of law; While thought and impulse, those creative springs On which the conduct of our being turns, In secret wildness kept unholy sway. Men learn'd to live, but were not taught to die; Each hour proclaim'd its own peculiar heaven; The heart might covet what the hand revered; And in the soul, a thousand years of sin Lie floating, on a sea of fancy toss'd, And be unblamed! No inward law prevail'd, Like that which ever to the Christian speaks; Prejudging thought, ere yet by deed express'd, And throning conscience in the heart of man. Thus, who can wonder that a darkness hung Round heathen ages, by no hand unveil'd? Magnificent and mighty was the Past, In learning, prowess, and devoted arts: Yet ne'er was hero, in his sun-bright car, With all his panoply of gorgeous hues And lauding thunders from a nation's lip To tell his conquest,—so sublimely great As dying Stephen, when that martyr quench'd By glorious faith the agonies of death, The sky beheld, and for his murd'rers pray'd! Bright as the morning of primeval day Burst on the waters of chaotic gloom, Came revelation on the darksome world. Then error vanish'd in celestial truth; Hush'd were false Oracles, and quench'd the fires Which savage bigotry for ages fed: New light, new order, new existence rose! The pangs of Wo, the wrongs of patient Worth, Were now no more, as once their truth had been: Eternity the debt of Time would pay, The soul redeem, and justify its God. Yet was not this transcendent scheme of love To Earth unfolded, till maturing age Had nerved the spirit for its high display. But just as nature, by apparent means And fine gradations of effective power, The miracle of life and form achieves, So Mind, in her advance to heavenly things, Progressively to full redemption came. In the calm innocence of youthful Time When Earth undeluged lay, the vocal Word By deep communion did Himself impart To his frail creature, Man: and Spirits bright, And loving Angels by their Lord empower'd Brought inward messages from God on high. When darkly sunk in Amoritish guilt The patriarchal purity was o'er, Religion hallow'd with Mosaic law, And special covenant, and ritual pomp Of ark and fane and sacrificial blood, The chosen People; thus in types began Sublime Theocracy; and when it sunk To kingly sway, prophetic Bards reveal'd The One Jehovah, and the promised Seed: Thus moved the destinies of Earth along In light and darkness, as career the waves Through sun and tempest, till Messiah rose. There are, who deem no revelation true Which doth not, by divine compulsion, awe The universal mind to one belief. But, where the freedom of inviolate will, If, dazzled into reasonless assent, Belief is passive, and conviction blind? The lines of human character are lost, No principle can act, no feeling sway, No Passion on the altar of pure Faith Can nobly die, in sacrifice to Heaven: As heave the waters to a reinless wind, So, led by impulse, would the spirit yield To Fate's high will, without one virtue blest. For what is virtue, but a vice withstood, Or sanctity, but daring sin o'ercome? Life is a warfare, which the soul confronts, While good and evil, truth and error clash, Or rally round it in confused array; And he who conquers, wins the crown of Light Which Heaven has woven for her warrior-saint. A God incarnate, with His glory veil'd, Altar, and priest, and sacrifice combined In mystic oneness of almighty Love, Behold Him bleeding! on His awful brow The mingled sorrows of a world repose: “'Tis finish'd!”—at those words Creation throbs; Round Hell's dark universe the echo rolls; All nature is unthroned; the mountains quake Like human beings when their death-pang comes; The sun has wither'd from the frighted air, And with a tomb-burst, hark! the Dead arise, And gaze upon the living, as they glide With soundless motion through the darken'd streets Most awfully!—the world's Redeemer dies! That hour of Blood, that scene of Death, is past, And quench'd the savage eyes that mock'd and smiled On Calv'ry, when the direful Cross upbore A martyr'd Saviour: but there comes a mood, When Fancy wanders to that fated hill, And from His pleading face, to heaven upturn'd In godlike pity for the murd'rous Jew, A look celestial for the soul derives When faints it oft in penitential gloom. And thou, my Country! foremost in the van Of glory found, no Empire which bedecks The globe, exalted mercies can record Like those that crown, and still encircle Thee, Eden of isles! whom ocean loves to guard. From the foul darkness of engulphing sin Celestial Mercy bade thy spirit rise Victorious, and in Christ regen'rate be. And, thus environ'd by elective grace, E'en like a fortress for the faith art thou: And though not spotless be thy past career, Religion from thy thousand Temples calls Aloud on Deity, and walks unseen The paths of goodness, musing holy joy. But ah! that day of spiritual delight Of old revered, and by our fathers blest, Thy Sabbath, England! is that halcyon morn Of holiness, when Heaven remembers thee With sanctifying love, and sheds abroad A balm that beautifies the face of things. Redemption won the boon; and long may sounds From steeple-towers of venerable gloom Or Minsters brown which deck the hawthorn-vales, Of sabbath-music on the breezy wings Of matin rise, and soft emotions crowd The soul that listens to their tender chime. And thus, while unpolluted Altars stand O'er time secure, and christian ardour keeps The virtues of our glorious Land alive, Jehovah! still for us Thine arm will rule; And Ocean, faithful to her island-born, Bulwark the clime whose sceptre bows to Thee. And may the glories of Thy gospel shine From zone to zone, till earth one Temple prove, And lauding angels, as they gird the Throne With choral raptures, hear from saints below Perpetual anthems which to Christ ascend. For Thou hast promised, and Thy word shall reign! Let earth be riven, sun and system die, Or nature into nothing be recall'd, Ere this be doubted,—the decree of God! Oft in the hush of meditative hours When fancy wanders on mysterious wing Far into chaos, greets the dawning world, And down the surging tides of ages floats E'en to the living hour,—I glow to trace Omniscient wisdom and perennial love. E'en now, as here in solitary mood My spirit warbles in a dream of song, What destinies are weaving for the race Of man! what energies of heart and soul In mingled yet harmonious play, for time That doom complete Eternity has plann'd? And, if our wingèd aspirations dare The hour outfly, and future glory meet, My brother Man! wherever doom'd thou art, In dark isles bosom'd on the dusky main A savage found, magnificently free; Or, in some icy wilderness of waves, Soon on thy soul may Revelation dawn And bid lost nature recognise its God. That prayer is heard: for with it richly blend Approving echoes from Britannia's heart. E'en now, her Genius on some native cliff Let Fancy view, in speculation rapt. To rocky isles, and dreadful island-wastes That spot the billows, her dejected eye Is turn'd, and what a vision of despair The savage dwellers on the sea create, Who round their dying captive dance and howl; Or, prostrate at some tow'ring idol's car, In bloody rapture limb and life destroy. To Heaven she looks, and lo! a sudden burst Of morning-brightness o'er the midnight-scene; For woods of horror, laughing corn-fields wave; For cavern'd homes, and huts of wildest gloom What sylvan cots and glitt'ring mansions rise, While sun-clad spires in every woodland gleam! And ships are riding in securest bays Of Commerce, where of old untravell'd sea Lay in grim slumber, or by whirlwinds lash'd. All things have glided into beauteous change, And Man, at whose creation God rejoiced, Not in the gloom and guilt of nature pines, But beaming with recover'd soul, appears, A true Schechinah where the Spirit dwells. The Genius of my Country!—on her brow What apostolic smiles of love and light Begin; for her the vision hath unroll'd Its promise; and to her hath God appeal'd For Earth, and bade from His divinest source The spirit of immortal truth proceed In heavenly conquest, till the knell of Time Be sounded, and the church in heaven complete. And here awhile, on this majestic hope Of brighter ages let the Lyre repose. But pardon, ye who feel how Nature makes Her priesthood vocal, if in fond delay A poet gaze upon the gorgeous eve, And watch the shadows of a waning sky. A sunset! what a host of beaming clouds In mingled lustre multiplied and flash'd, And flung their beauty in reflected tints On golden waters, lull'd in gleaming rest, And then, concenter'd in one pomp of light Like that which girds th' apocalyptic throne! But, ere the sun behind yon sea withdrew, A thunder-gloom in silent threat advanced; And the loud hiss of unexpected rain Rang through the air with its rejoicing fall, The verdure sparkled, and the sun retired On waves of glory like an ocean god: From out the billows beam'd a rainbow-form Which died in azure o'er the distant hills; The sea-gull flutter'd on his foam-like wing, And, like a seraph in the air conceal'd, The wind-tone warbled with unearthly joy. An hour with nature is an hour with heav'n, When feeling hallows what the fancy views: And thus, O Twilight! may a soul discern In thy meek stillness what harsh day obscures. Now Mem'ry too with mournful love recalls Some heart-romance, till years of verdant joy Revive, and bloom within affection's world. Bright Forms, by greeting childhood so beloved! Maternal tones, and features, of whose smile In blissful rivalry our own was born, And voices, echoed in our dreams of heaven, Around us throng, until th' unliving past Our being enters, and seems life again. In no false weakness heaves the votive sigh Of fond remembrance o'er man's fleeting youth; The poetry of pure regret is there! To love the past but makes the present dear; The mournful wisdom of our discontent Can then unteach what young Delusion taught Alone; since who that lives, and living, thinks, But adds another to an endless train Of sad Confessors since the world began?— A life of glory is a dream fulfill'd, That fades in acting, as the gorgeous cloud E'en as it dazzles is but dying air! If I too, ere autumnal age my brow Has wrinkled, or the twilight of chill days Begun, the barrenness of earth perceive, And feel mortality's most aching wear Fever and fret the soul; if all which bloom'd Like Eden once, hath grown a desert now Of dying hope, and faded joy; if Life be lone, And sad, and bleak, while aspirations droop Unwatch'd within me, and delightless earth More tomb-like grows, as death's absorbing dream Haunts the worn spirit wheresoe'er it fly For refuge, may I not existence mourn? No! let me fall, and worship at the Fount Of promise; life is Heaven's surpassing gift, And what his Maker wills, should man revere. To cover earth with shades of hell; accuse The sun of darkness, and the world blaspheme; All hope deny, coequal man disdain, And mar the heavenliness of human joy, Betrays a tempest of unholy thought Raised by the Demon of our darker hours! But, nobly true, inexplicably deep That mournfulness by solitude inspired, When mild dejection ends in musing bliss. Like a mute pilgrim, on some distant shore At twilight shaping in the skiey air The towers and temples of his native land, While on his ear the sounds of home renew The sweetness of their social melody,— Oft may some Dreamer in a spirit-trance Fancy existence to be exile now; See visions of departed heaven, and hear The muffled language of mysterious Worlds. And oh! how oft beneath the bluest sky In summer arching over lake or wood, When round and round, with antic motion sport The insect-populace of beams and flowers; When herb is bright, and breeze is gay, the Mind A mystic shadow of dejection feels, While voiceless omens and prophetic fears Haunt the deep heart with their undying spell. For ever on the solemn verge we seem Of gloom unknown, or glory unreveal'd; And who shall say, that life does not preserve A faint reflection of some vanish'd State By man forgot, as oft the sea retains A dim resemblance of departed storm? 'Tis night; the holiness and heaven of time! And censure me, mild Elements, whose sway Of loveliness hath now serened the world, If by your charm my soul is unsubdued By prayer, while Nature in devotion seems. Mysterious hour! when most self-knowledge reigns. And minutes are soft Teachers, whom the heart Obeys: and, art Thou not more deeply fill'd With inspiration from thy Maker sent, O Earth! than in the day's tyrannic roar? And if there be, as saintly minds allow, Some god-like moment, when pure Spirits walk This lower world, where man is doom'd to strive, Tranquillity enshrines their presence now. In pale omnipotence of light the moon Presides, too brilliantly for meeker stars To venture forth, save one bright watcher, seen O'er yon lone hill to let his beauty smile: The clouds are dead; and scarce a breeze profanes The blissful calm, save when some rebel dares On fitful wing to wander into life Awhile, and make unwilling branches wave, Or moonlight flutter through the boughs, and fall In broken radiance on the grass beneath. The earth grows soundless; and yon giant elms Hush'd into leafy trance their shade project Before them: Night and Stillness are enthroned. Now may the spirit on religious wing Expatiate; soaring where no science can, Yet haply, hover round some truth unknown. And be this earth all reverently trod, Since out of it did human Dust proceed! Let all we look upon religion make For inmost thought, or meditative love. On choral winds aye let there float a voice Of God; and Ocean with his organ-waves Eternal anthems to Jehovah peal. And oh! may I, when pangful life is o'er, In some pure region of almighty bliss A harping strain from those bright Singers learn, Who in the orchestra of Glory waft Divine Emmanuel! to Thy merit due, From golden lyres an everlasting praise. BOOK III. “Prepare the way! a God, a God appears! A God! a God! the echoing vales reply.” Pope. “A venerable and sacred tradition relates, that by the rising of a certain uncommon star was foretold, not diseases or death, but the descent of an adorable God for the salvation of the human race, and the melioration of human affairs; which star, they say, was observed by the Chaldeans, who came to present their offerings to the new-born God.”—From Chalcidius, an ancient Commentator on the Timæus of Plato.

The Book ends with a view of the consolation of the Scriptures, and the beauty of the outward Universe, when enjoyed in connexion with the Divine Creator. Now was the fulness of predestined time Complete, when councils of the God Triune In Christ embodied, should at length evolve; And not ungreeted did Redemption's hour Arrive: before the Throne new radiance burn'd; And emanations of intenser bliss Than that which kindled o'er creation's birth, Angelic myriads felt, as peal'd their chants Of hymning wonder!—yea, in spirit-worlds From whence no living Shape to earth has come, Round these, perchance, a sympathetic thrill Of worship ran, when first Salvation dawn'd. And thou! the demon-King of darkness throned In thine eternity of tort'ring fires, Thou dread Apostate! who didst shake the skies For vict'ry, vanquish'd, but rebellious still; On thee the glories of Messiah's reign Beam'd terrible: within thy dark abyss When ruin'd angels to the summons throng'd, With dreadful beauty, like a dying sun Amid the tempest sinking, each adorn'd, No triumph on thy thunder-blasted brow, But deeper vengeance, more despairing wo Than yet the realms of agony endured, Was visible; that hour, so long foredoom'd, Is coming, when a world shall be unbound From chains infernal, and the Powers of Hell Disarm'd for ever on their crumbling thrones! Meanwhile, on earth mute Expectation sat And listen'd; for a rumour, echoed down From dateless time, of two surpassing Kings Predestined on the globe to rule, prevail'd; Whose powers, though blended in Virgilian song, Sublimely differ'd. In Augustan peace The world reposed; and grateful Rome beheld Her Janus shut, her crimson banners furl'd. No more Dodona, from the oaken shade, Or Delphi, from exhaling cavern, sent Vain oracles in mystic verse enweaved. The Temples mourn'd; Idolatry was dumb, Or mutter'd faintly from her glimmering shrines; While Art and Science, in their palmy state, Triumphantly advanced. Thus, all matured, And apt to question with profoundest thought Each creed or doctrine of diviner sway, The World awaited her Messiah's dawn: From realm to realm a vast tradition reign'd Of sibyl-words, which sang the coming God; While many a heart, prophetically deep, Mused in the silence of majestic hope, Or, heaven-inspired, the Earth's Redeemer hail'd. Thus all below; when Gabriel heard a voice Of thunder from the Throne proceed, which bade To Galilee a wingèd flight convey His presence, where in rocky Naz'reth dwelt A Maiden pure, to Joseph then betroth'd. And lo, an Angel brighten'd into view Before her, like a lovely burst of morn! And while she trembled, dazzled into dread, A Salutation of entrancing sound Fell on her ear:—“Divinely favoured Thou! Of women blest! The Lord is with thee, hail! A Son, behold, thy virgin womb shall bear; Son of the Highest! Jesus let His name Be called; upon the throne of David fix'd, O'er Jacob's house for ever shall he reign, And endless his predestined kingdom prove.” “But how?” cried Mary, “Since I know not man.” Again the Angel: “Overshadowing thee The Holy Spirit will in power descend, And That thou bearest, Son of God be call'd.” Then answer'd she, “Behold thy handmaid, Lord! And be thy word fulfill'd,” as brightly fled The glowing Angel to his native skies. Let Silence think, for how can words reveal Her full devotion of ecstatic thought, When Mary ponder'd on that promised Child? Let mothers tell! to whose enchanted ears Earth brings no music like the helpless cry Of new-born life, from lips which know not guile. Oh! Maid elect! with more than gladness wing'd, In the young beauty of thy spousal bloom To Hebron didst thou o'er the mountains pass, And visit one, by Heav'n's bright herald warn'd. 'Mid the faint crimson of a flushing dawn That Pilgrim started, when the breeze was up, And, like a wing, invisibly career'd O'er woods and waters: from the grey ravines The oak and olive sent a leafy sound, And with her multitude of orient flow'rs The blooming Sharon glitter'd from afar; Or, gazing from some terraced rock or hill, The herding goats from villages and vales, And wild onàgras, free as desert-wind, Her eye discern'd; while veil'd Arabians sought A distant well, like Midian girls of old; And others to empurpled vineyards hied, 'Mid the soft radiance of unshrouding morn. By Heaven secured, o'er lone and lofty heights She glided on; and trod with eager foot Each verdant slope, each rocky change of scene, Where olive waved, or cypress-shadow fell. But oft she paused, and bless'd the vital breeze From lake upborne; or, when some hill or plain Of green magnificence, or glorious view Of nature's wonders, to her eye appeal'd,— How beautiful! to hear the Maiden chant Hymns to Jehovah, while her soul recall'd Those hallow'd memories which ever cling To ground immortal as great Palestine! Oh, tell me not of trophied Greece, and groves Where Plato wander'd; or poetic streams That wind through Homer's page, or Pindar's song; For Palestine by God Himself was loved, Inhabited, and blest! His Spirit there Hath walk'd, the shadow of His glory been, His miracles prevail'd,—the mountains blazed With His descending lustre! all her vales, Her fountains, rivers, and delicious plains, Of patriarchs and prophets speak; beneath the shade Of her ancestral trees have Angels sat, And holy Abram smiled: her meanest spot Is mighty, and her dust a sacred charm, For in it sleep the World's primeval sires! Unbounded Fancy! on whose fairy wings The spirit voyageth o'er realms and isles, Oh, waft me now to Tabor's solemn height, Where Barak and his heaven-arm'd thousands hid, And there the Drama of the world renew! Let Eden rise, her boughs and branches wave, And Shapes aerial from the clouds descend, To view her lovely bowers. The Flood react,— Earth, sea, and sky in billowy chaos lost! Revive the Patriarchs; mark their rev'rent forms, Or hear the Prophets when the people rage. Or, wouldst thou from the sacred past retire To scenes which live,—from haunted Tabor view The greenness of a hundred glorious plains! Lo, vast Esdraelon, like a verdant sea, By dew-famed Hermon bound; there, Endor lies. Where dwelt the night-hag in unholy gloom And Saul seem'd wither'd as the spectre rose, Wrapp'd in a mantle, out of Hades call'd. But northward, lock'd in azure calm of noon, Thy lake, Tiberias! on that blue extent Of shining waters oft the Saviour look'd; And near yon mountain, iced with dazzling snow, The sacred hill whereon He sat, and taught The wisdom of eternity to man. But, see! o'er Judah's aromatic clime The sun is west'ring: long ere twilight rose With dewy welcome to her second night Of mountain-pilgrimage, the Virgin stood Beneath the shelter of a rustic cot, In Hebron, and her holy cousin hail'd, Enraptured! What sublime emotion clad Each feature, what a radiance fill'd her eyes, And touch'd her form, when that saluting voice Was heard, as thrilling with celestial truth Elizabeth on Mary gazed, and cried, “Of Women blest! divinely blest, art thou!” While leapt the babe within her womb, for joy. And thus did Mary in her chant respond, “My soul the gracious Lord doth magnify! The proud He scatters, but the meek regards; For thus to Abram and our fathers spake The God of Israel; glorious be His name! For me, his lowly Handmaid, ever-blest Shall ages deem, and generations call.” But now, from Cæsar came a high command For Judah's offspring to enroll their birth. Then Joseph, by angelic dream forewarn'd How vestal Mary had from God conceived, To Bethlehem went; and there the infant Christ His Virgin-Mother in a manger laid: All pure and holy, as the promise spake.— And say! what hour so awefully instinct With Secrets from eternity ordain'd, As when th' Incarnate met the placid gaze Of His unspotted Mother! what enshrined A scene, where Deity the mortal shape Of feeble infant took, and, rudely wrapt, In new-born meekness smiling forth the God, Deliver'd earth and thrill'd the Heavens with joy! That night were shepherds at their watches due Around unfolded sheep, in that soft vale Whose fountain warbled to the dreaming ear Of David, when he sought Adullam's cave. A calm so deep, that silence seem'd a soul, Pervaded all things; dew-light on the ground Was glist'ring, and the vigil-shepherds watch'd Contentedly their breathing charge recline On pastures, where the morning flock had fed. No cloud the heaven defiled; but, clear and large, The planets in their throbbing lustre shone. 'Twas then, while Nature mute as dreaming air Reposed, a melody in wafted flow Advanced; and when it reach'd the starry plain, An earthless Form, seraphically robed, Evolved, and glitter'd like a noontide-sea. Awe-smote, and blinded with excessive blaze Of archangelic lustre, on the ground Each shepherd sank, nor dared with lifted eye The Glory face, till words of music came: “Ye pious watchers; tremble not; behold The tidings of eternal joy I bring: This night the Saviour of the World is born! Within a manger, lo! the Babe is found!” He said; and as the lull of golden streams When soft-toned winds melodiously awake, The radiant quiver of angelic plumes The air attuned, which trembled into song, While, robed with brightness, thus the choir began: “Thou Lord of Lords, and Light of Light! Who, with empyreal glory bright, Art seated on th' Eternal Throne Invisibly, the vast Alone, Ten thousand worlds around Thee blaze, Ten thousand harps repeat Thy praise, Yet hymn, nor harp, nor song divine, Nor myriad orbs created Thine, This measureless display of love To earth below and heaven above With blending eloquence can tell That ends the Curse, and conquers Hell; For lo! the manger where He lies, A world-redeeming Sacrifice: Peace on earth, to Man good will, Let the skies our anthem fill! “Hail, Virgin-born! transcendent Child In mortal semblance, undefiled, By ages vision'd, doom'd to be The Star of Immortality; Hail! Prince of Peace, and Lord of Light! Around thy path the world is bright; Where'er Thou tread'st an Eden blooms, And Earth forgets her myriad tombs: Thy voice is heard—and Anguish dies, The dead awake and greet the skies; Lo! Blindness melts in healing rays, And mute Lips ope in hymns of praise; The famish'd on Thy bounty feed, While myriads at Thy summons speed Redeem'd from woe, and sin, and pain To see the lost restored again: Peace on earth, to Man good will, Let the skies our anthem fill! “Awake, awake, thou ransom'd Earth! And, blooming with a second birth, In loveliness awake and shine, Thy King is come, Salvation thine! The winds are rock'd in holy rest, The waves asleep on Ocean's breast, And beautiful the boundless calm O'er nature spread, like midnight balm; For lo! the manger where He lies, A world-redeeming Sacrifice; The Promised, since the world began, To live and die for guilty Man. “Again, again, the anthem swell! For Heaven shall burst the gates of Hell! A vision of uncounted years Which travel on through toil and tears, Is all unroll'd in wild extent Like ocean's surging element: But soon that darken'd scene hath past And rules the Lord in light, at last! The sunbeams of a sabbath-day Around adoring myriads play: From north to south, from east to west, All pangs are hush'd, all hearts at rest: Pacific homes, Atlantic isles, Far as the vast creation smiles, The rudest spot which man can own, Shall hail Messiah on His throne; And lauding souls by land and sea, One Altar build, O God! to Thee; While men and angels round it throng To chant the sempiternal song, Peace on earth, to Man good will, Let the skies our anthem fill!” Hush'd the deep chant, the choral Train ascends, And then commingles in one pomp of light, While all entranced th'adoring she pherds kneel: But when the bright ascent was o'er, up rose They all in ravishment; to Bethlehem sped, And there Messiah wrapp'd in swaddling-clothes They found, and sang with reverential joy A hymn of worship to the Babe divine; While Mary, meekly silent, heard the tale Of wonder, musing with prophetic soul. O World! and was it thus thy Saviour came? Rich as the chorus of Creation's morn From every region should thy lips have pour'd A loud hosannah to proclaim the Lord! The skies have bent, the mountains clapp'd their hands, The cedars waved from every conscious hill, And Sun and Moon, and each melodious Star, And Ocean, with his jubilee of waves Have thrill'd the universe with natal joy! But all was silent, unobserved and still; No Empire sung, when man's Redeemer came; The peasant-mother in her Alpine cot, At dreadful midnight, no desertion feels, Like that rude manger where the Virgin lay, And scarce a solitary taper shone! Is this the Wonderful? the Prince of Light, The King of kings, o'er countless worlds enthroned. Oh! Language cannot with its brightest words Adumbrate, or by epithets express The imagined splendors which proud Judah dreamt Would crown Messiah, when He came to give Her ransom'd myriads all Isaiah sung! Empires have sunk, and waning kingdoms died, But still, apart, sublime in mis'ry stands The wreck of Israel! Christ hath come, and bled, And miracles and ages round the Cross A holy splendour of undying truth Preserve; yet still their pining spirit looks For that unrisen Sun which prophets hail'd! Where once the Temple, bathed in golden hues, Immense as glorious, with her matchless spires On mount Moriah stood, a race exist In darkness,—still to Zion turn, and weep! And when I view him in his garb of wo, A wand'ring outcast, by the world disown'd, The haggard, lost, and long-oppressèd Jew, “His blood be on us,” through remembrance rolls In fearful echo from a nation's lip! Then widow'd Zion! still for thee awaits A future, teeming with triumphal sounds And Shapes of glory; still a remnant lives, Who once again thy banner shall unroll And plant it on thine everlasting walls. The Cities huge which overaw'd the world Rot in a gloom, irrevocably seal'd, Of desolation; Time shall never rear The towers, nor crowd their weed-grown walks again. But Judah, like some Babylonian wreck Which age nor elemental wrath subdues, In mournful grandeur that outlives decay There as it lies on yon deserted plain,— Shall yet endure, till Restoration's voice Her orphan'd race to Salem's clime recall. Exult, O Zion! for thy God is king, And lift thy banner on the mountain-tops; From Egypt, Pathros, and Assyria call'd, From Shinar, Hamath, and the sea-born isles, From the vast regions of the utmost orb Returning Israel for dominion comes! A voice of Weeping, it is heard no more; The timbrels sound, her glad-eyed maidens dance, Her young men shout, the aged meekly smile, Rememb'ring all the pleasant things of old! The lea of Sharon, and the pastured glen Of Achre, beautiful in verdure shine; While planted vincyards with a costly bloom Wave on her hills, and court the rip'ning sun. The lamb, the lion, and the infant play Together; Righteousness thy gate adorns, And peace divine, by purity bestow'd From God incarnate, in thy sacred walls, Recover'd Palestine! for ever dwells. As when a mother for an absent child Laments, till beauty on her cheek decays, Yet haply in declining loveliness More exquisite than in her glowing prime Appeareth, so doth thine afflicted Land Touch the deep spirit with diviner thought. Now in thy wo, than when a bridal pomp Bedeck'd thee. For the homeless race afar Thou yearnest with a soft maternal grief; To hill and mountain the devouring Curse Hath clung; and rivers down unpeopled vales Like mournful pilgrims glide; while fruit nor tree Bear to the tyrant what thy children took From thy fond bosom: yet, a latent power Of life and glory in thy wither'd soil Is buried, that shall rise when Judah comes; Like music sleeping in a haughty lyre, Whose muteness only to the master-touch Breaks into sound which ravishes a world! Now, o'er the infant God a day decreed For circumcision rose, in wonted light, And “Jesus” (let the heavens and earth revere That word almighty!) was the name he bore. And then, each light of due lustration done, The lowly Virgin to the Temple brings The young Redeemer; thus had God ordain'd. No lamb had she; but in her meekness brought Two turtle-doves of pure and spotless wing, And solemnly within the outer-court Awaited, while a Priest the Lord approach'd: And haply, on the Temple's wondrous mass Of finish'd beauty and effulgent pomp Oft gazed, and gloried in her ancient creed That there the God of Israel loved to dwell! But when th' oblation of unspotted doves Was paid, an inner court's wide precincts ope, And Mary enters with her bosom'd child; Then silently, with glance of tend'rest love, For presentation yields the Babe divine. But who is he, with beard of flowing white, Who onward moves amid the ritual pomp? Led by the Spirit, lo! a bending Form Approaches, kindles as with sudden youth, Her Babe enclasps, and to his Maker cries, “In peace, O Lord! now let Thy servant go; These eyes have seen, these wither'd arms embrace Thy promised One, a Child of Glory, sent To lighten Israel, and the world restore!” Yes, morning, noon, and night, in dream or prayer, In temple-worship, and mysterious hours, For this he long'd, to see Messiah born!— The Saviour came, and Simeon died in joy. Each rite complete, the Holy Fam'ly sought In Bethlehem-vale their consecrated home; There, scarce arrived, when lo! as Magi bow'd In nightly worship to unnumber'd worlds Of starry name, an orbèd Meteor shone With mystic beams oracularly bright! But well they knew, those star-adoring Seers, That revelation high, and sped on wings Of holy speed to Zion's stately haunt; There wond'ringly around old Salem's walls Exclaim'd, “The new-born great! Judean King, His dwelling say, for Him would we adore!” And souls there lived, which drank, as thirsty ground A summer-rain absorbs, refreshing hope, When orient Sages of a mighty birth For Israel spake: for Judah long had pined, And on the willows hung her captive harp: But he, whom Mariamne's murder'd form For ever haunted like a dream of hell, The guilty, pamper'd, pale Herodian king! Heard this, and trembled: yet in bloody calm His purpose lay, and thus that king address'd Those eastern Magi: “Swift to Bethlehem, haste! The infant find, around his cradle kneel, And tell, where I may come and worship, too?” They went; and lo! yon beauteous Star, In loveliness beyond all radiant orbs Which decorate the night, a guidance lent, Till o'er that roof where lay the Lord of Worlds It paused, and quiver'd as with conscious beams; There sped the Magi, earth's Redeemer found Encradled; and with bending awe they kneel, His Form adore, and solemn worship pay With myrrh and frankincense; while Mary stands In wonder; with her eye to heaven upturn'd, Her bosom swelling with a silent hymn, And in her spirit more than mother's joy! Their homage done, and earth's Messiah seen, By God forewarn'd, the orient pilgrims wend Afar from Herod, to their destined home. That night, in visionary trance, appear'd The Shape angelic Joseph once beheld: “Arise! to Egypt with the Virgin speed, And holy Infant; Him would Herod slay!” To that high word obedient, ere the blush Of morning crimson'd Horeb's sainted brow Or Jordan's waters in the sunshine wound, By Heaven environ'd, as a viewless guard, To Egypt went he, till the monarch died: “For out of Egypt have I call'd my Son!” So spake the Seer, whose word our God fulfill'd. Then passion, like a kindled hurricane Burst from the tyrant with terrific sway, And cruel havoc, dark as Hell desired; Oh! then were shrieks maternal, sounds which came From riven souls, and childless Rachel wept. In Rama was the voice of mourning heard, And red with blood the streams of Israel ran, 'Twas Murder's banquet on a thousand babes!— Sweet flowers of Life, whose fragile beauty made The living Eden of parental hearts; Asleep in cradled stillness, with the light Of infant slumber on their lovely cheeks, Or prattling gaily at the cottage-door, Slaughter o'ertook them, and with murderous yell Mock'd the sad mothers, shrieking for their God! That cry was answer'd when the monster-king, By pain corrupted, turn'd a loathsome mass, And died! Then, heralded by Gabriel's wings, The infant-Saviour into Nazareth came; For Archelaus o'er Judah's empire ruled, And, Herod-like, had bathed his throne in blood. Mysterious Time! o'er many realms and lands Thy shadow broods, which man cannot dispel, Or brighten; but o'er that most hallow'd scene Where dwelt unknown, in human meekness veil'd, Incarnate Glory, lies thy thickest gloom. For ever hidden, by no voice reveal'd, The holy childhood of the Saviour-God. Yet, wafted back on no irrev'rent wing, Imagination oft her eye would fix On that green vale, where first The Morning-Star With mildest beauty rose. By earth unfelt, Celestial watchers! did ye not descend And hover round, while grew that awful Child In the pure light of Mary's pensive gaze? Maiden and mother! whom all ages bless When lock'd in slumber the Redeemer lay, How on His features did thine homage dwell! But years departed; and Messiah grew Strong in the spirit, wisdom, grace and power; Then oft at eve, when sultry day was o'er, The holy Infant, by parental knee, The Book of Life with tender awe perused, And question'd; while in love's delightful dream Each parent mused; recalling oft the Shapes Angelic, or that vision Bethlehem saw; Or, sounding all the dim and mighty depths Of prophecy, where solemn meanings lay. And ah, how beautiful! in cradled sleep While slept her Child, to mark the wedded Maid On His pure brow a gentle kiss implant, And then to Joseph, with a speaking look This truth convey—“How wonderful is Heaven, If there the Hope of fallen Israel lies!” When twelve years thus the Son of God had spent, To celebrate a high and solemn feast, Begun when over Egypt's first-born flew The direful Angel on his wings of death, All came; and with excited myriads went Christ's holy parents up to Salem's walls, As true adorers. When the seventh day saw Each rite concluded, back to Nazareth vale They speed, but where is He, the sacred Boy? With friends beloved, or in Jerusalem lost? There hasten'd they, and sorrowingly roam'd The Virgin-mother, garden, grove, and field; And as she hurried through becrowded paths Her eye's fond question moved each passing face With feeling:—such as thoughts untold betray When look is language, and that language read By hearts which sympathise with pangs unknown. And thus she sought Him with unwearied step, Till tears had gather'd, and her gaze was dim, Yet found Him not: when hark! a burst of joy Maternal; in the temple, lo, He stands; With priest and sage, and vested rabbis mix'd, The lost One lingers:—on His brow the light Of Godhead! from His lips a stream of words Is flowing, fraught with spirit-moving power That shook all hearts, the ear of Age entranced, And through dark conscience pour'd celestial rays Which had not shone before. Each look'd on each, Astounded; wisdom seem'd a thing unwise By man announced; Divinity was there! But, garb'd in lowliness, that peasant-Child His temple left, a mother's smile renew'd, And gently her inquiring wonder check'd With words unfathom'd, yet, in Mary's heart Embalm'd for ever with revering love! Then, homeward once again the pilgrims haste United; musing on the festal pomp, And crowded worship, such as Salem loved. And long before the pallid star of Eve Had heralded the hush of twilight-hour, A cot was round them, in their quiet vale. By Nazareth are green and silent dells, Secluded groves, and rocky shades profound; And here Messiah dwelt:—those eighteen years Of fameless calm, wherein the Lord of Light Reposed, and suffer'd like a human Child, But sinless, all our burden, toil, and tears, With what a mystery of voiceless awe They sink upon the inmost heart of man! Whether on thee, O Virgin blest! we muse, Thy soul by reverence and awe subdued To something holier than mother's love; Or that all-glorious all-majestic Form In Whom was center'd man's eternal hope, Survey, amid the still and solemn vale,— Our thoughts are thrilling as the tears which rise When Angels warble round a soul forgiven: That wondrous Being! in those mountain-dells As lone He wander'd, did He not forecast The awful drama of His life to come? On this He ponder'd; this the mind perceived; From Cana's miracle to Calv'ry's mount, The crown and cross, the agony of death He view'd; nor dash'd the bitter Cup away The Curse had fill'd, and Man was doom'd to drink Had Christ not come, and drank the cup, and died! But now the hour decretive Heaven ordain'd For Jesus to unfold th' Almighty will, Approach'd. Tiberius o'er imperial Rome Was reigning, and in subject Judah ruled The savage Pilate; when the Word of God To John amid the wilderness was sent; For thus the Seer prophetically sang: “A voice comes wafted through the wilderness! From Him who crieth, ‘Let the mountains sink, The valleys rise, and be the deserts smooth! A God approaches! be His way prepared!’” That great Precursor, whose proclaiming voice, “Repent ye!” pierced the wilderness with dread, Was robed in hairy sackcloth; round his loins A leathern girdle wound; the mountain-spring, Which bubbled through the vale, his drink supplied; His meat was honey and the locust wild. Alone, but angel-watch'd, that Orphan grew To manhood; nursed amid the elements, A son of Nature, where the Desert waved Her wildest boughs, or flung the blackest gloom That cavern'd Eremite with God communed, In storm or stillness, when the thunder voiced His anger, or a sunshine wore His smile. One awful loneliness his life became, In thought and prayer mysteriously it pass'd; And oft, sublime!—as when at sunset-hour, A fierce magnificence of crimson hues Redden'd the mountains, while each rocky crest Of Judah with volcanic lustre blazed, And slept the sultry air, the prophet knelt; And the wild glory of his dreaming eye To heaven was turn'd, in meditative awe. The hush of woods, the hymn of waters faint, And azure prospect of yon midland-sea Beyond the desert, glimmering and vast, And dying cadence of some distant bird Whose song was fading like a silver cloud,— 'Mid sights and sounds, commingled like to these, Earth had no grander scene, than when the hour Of Syrian twilight heard the Baptist pray! Beside the waters of th' unliving Sea Where buried cities lift their ghastly wreck In tomb-like waste, the Prophet chanced to muse, Dreaming of dark Gomorrah, and the loud Despair of millions, when the thunder knell'd And rapidly a burning deluge came. An airy stillness, solitude intense Was there: no bird upon enchanted wing; No murmur, but the reedy moan of banks Of sickly herbage; or the creeping sound Of Jordan, dragging its sepulchral way; Sea, sky, and air in one unearthly calm Reposed! In such a scene of lifeless gloom While mused the Baptist on the guilt of Man, A mighty impulse, an inbreathing power Of Inspiration on his spirit came! He felt the God; and, fill'd with sacred fire, To Jordan hasten'd; soon that region round “Repent ye!” heard each hill and vale repeat. Where ran the holiest of holy Streams That wind and glitter through green Palestine, His cry awoke, from whence a warning rung With tones of terror, till before them fled The sinful passions of a sensual crowd, Like waves before the wind! From Judah's realm To Alexandria's clime, his solemn threat Was echoed; till around the Baptist throng'd All sects and nations, to repent, and live By laving waters of Baptismal power. There stood the Sadducee! with eye unscaled, To see the darkness of the grave illumed By Words immortal; there the glozing tribe Of Pharisees, with frighted soul appeal'd For mercy, cowering as the prophet cried, “Ye vipers! who hath warn'd you from the wrath To come? Repentance! let thy fruits appear; The axe is laid, and every fruitless tree Shall wither! lo, the fire of vengeance falls!” Divine Repentance! in thy sacred tear Alone is wisdom for the erring heart. That infancy of soul, that stainless hour When the stern chaos of our spirit sleeps In passionless repose, how oft it woos Our feelings back to purity and heaven! Alas! that in our solitude we soar To perfect goodness, but in life descend To dust again!—our aspirations quench'd, Till all which purer moments wisely taught, And conscience sanction'd, is a dream forgot! Yet all we ponder, fancy, feel, or view, Hath something for the soul's mysterious chords Attuned, to thrill them with religious tones. But, far above each sight or sound of earth, Or mind of man, that heaven-revealing Book In whose dread tones of everlasting truth The inspirations of Jehovah dwell! There find we visions of transcendent blaze, And heralds bright, embassadors divine, And voices from the Throne and Seat of bliss, And hallelujahs from angelic choirs, And God Eternal, with His Thunder girt, And Radiance, speaking like the ocean vast! And you, blest Oracles! whose words relate The story of Redemption, all sublime, With what a simple rectitude severe Your page immortal moves from change to change! Nor turn'd, nor daunted, whatsoe'er the gloom Or brightness of the awful Scene, it paints: So rolls a river through a wide domain; Whate'er the colour which the clouds reflect, Or bank, or verdure, on its beauty flings, It travels onward with the stately course Of sound and motion, to the fated sea. By these alone, can mortal Life unweave Her web of mystic lines, and many hues, And man's eternity before him rise In dreams of light, or shadows of despair. At evening once, beside a circling shore Of sandy wildness, where the billows loved Their foaming solitude, my fancy stray'd: Dark crags, and summits, fit for tempest-thrones, Hung near: but mid-way, on a lofty mount, By the green splendour of tumultuous grass Made beautiful, there mused a wither'd Shape By sorrow featured: on his wasted cheek Sat wan decline; but still the quenchless eye Was glorious, — there, undying radiance gleam'd! A Book, an ancient Book of faded leaves Was open'd, which, with bended brow, he read Intently: nearer still my footstep crept, And by the breeze from his pale lip was brought Soft under-tones of some almighty speech; Till, quaking with excess of thought divine, Down on the herb adoringly he sank And fix'd his eyes upon the awful heavens, As though enthroned there God himself appear'd! And then, while rolling tears ran bright and large, Exultingly his gasping spirit cried, “For ever and for ever is Thy Throne Transcendent, Lord, and everlasting King!” True Adoration, what a voice is thine! From earth it wanders through the heaven of heavens, There from the mercy-seat in light evokes An answer, thrilling the seraphic Host With new additions of adoring song! For prayer is man's omnipotence below, A soul's companionship with Christ and God, Communion with eternity begun. Oh, love celestial! earth can heaven-like grow, If man profane it not by savage tread And sordid gaze. E'en now, the sun appears A king of glory: and this breathing world, Like some vast instrument of varied sound The conscious melodies of life awakes: Yon sky is covered with soft isles of cloud, Which flash or float as sun and wind command; The air is balm, the breeze a living joy; My heart is dumb with an exceeding bliss Of light and beauty, pouring in from Day's Enchantment; while beneath yon vernal hill Whose sunny greenness mirrors all the clouds, Poetic murmurs from a distant sea In lulling falls come faintly on the mind. But now, the wearied Elements prepare For slumber; modulated breezes swell; The sky, with ocean-mimicry adorn'd, Grows pale and paler; soon will stars advance And seem to palpitate, as there they shine, With throbbing beauty! Thus will night begin And earth lie cradled in a dim repose, Till the pure heaven comes down upon the soul And all is hush'd beneath a holy spell. So ends a sabbath; so may sabbaths end Devoutly sacred, till the wings of Time Be folded, and eternal sabbath reigns. For all Thy ministries begin and end In Love, that glorious synonyme of Thee, Both in the heavens, and in the heart enshrined! From the first tear which roll'd down Adam's cheek To the last pang of living bosoms now, In light and darkness, still our God is Love! BOOK IV. “Oh, Goodness Infinite! Goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce And evil turn to good; more wonderful Than that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness!” —Paradise Lost, book xii. ANALYSIS OF BOOK IV.

A brow irradiate with impassion'd zeal, An eye majestic, and a voice intoned With vocal energy from heaven inspired, Were his, who usher'd in th' expected God! From cot to palace rose his high reproof; Wherever wander'd in the realm of vice The heart of man, “Repent ye!” sounded there. What marvel, then, Messiah's self appear'd In John embodied, till the people cried, With loud impatience, “Art thou Christ, the True?” “With water I indeed baptise and bless; But One shall come, transcendently sublime O'er me, the very latchet of Whose shoes I am not worthy to unbind! with fire, And with the Holy Ghost shall He baptise; Behold, the fan is in His fearful hands! The wheat He gathers, but the wicked chaff Ungarner'd, burneth with a quenchless flame!” Thus answer'd he; and shaded Israel's heart With wonder, dreaming on the dark unknown. While thus by Jordan's hallow'd wave, the Rite Of Waters, sanction'd by mysterious sway, The Baptist to repenting souls perform'd, The Lord of Life, in human weakness veil'd, Himself presented. Round His awful head No glory play'd; nor dread effulgence beam'd As on He came: yet, sacredly o'erpower'd By some deep impulse, vast and undefined, The Crowd stood parted; and a solemn hush, Like stillness o'er a forest when the winds Lull'd into soundless trance their wings upfold, The murm'ring host subdued: but on thy face Great Harbinger! a recognition glow'd, And spirit-bright thy gladden'd mien became; For He, whom prescient heaven to earth foretold, Before Thee stood; Salvation's Prince appear'd! And this, thy greeting: “Lo! at length He comes; Behold the Lamb of God! Oh! pure above All Beings pure, from me this rite forego; For need I have of Thy baptising grace, And comest Thou to mine?” “Refuse me not; Since thus all righteousness must be fulfill'd:” So speaking, down the bank Messiah moved, Stood in the waters, there the Rite received, And thence arose, with voiceless prayer becalm'd. When lo! the heavens miraculously oped, The dazzling concave God himself reveal'd Descending, lustrous with ethereal light: While dove-like hover'd o'er the Saviour's head Th' Eternal Spirit, and a Voice declared Like sea and thunder when their music blends, “Adore Him! This is My beloved Son!” But now advanced temptation's demon-power To crush the Saviour! By the Holy Ghost Compell'd, within a desert's trackless wild Alone He wander'd, unperceived by eyes Of mortal; there to meditate and pray, And scan the secrets of almighty grace Himself embodied by redeeming love. A noontide o'er his contemplation sped Away, and still the awful Thinker roved With foot unwearied: sunset, fierce and red, Succeeded: never hung a savage glare Upon the wilderness, like that which tinged This fated hour! the trees and herbless rock Wore angry lustre, and the dying Sun Sank downward like a deity of wrath, Behind him leaving clouds of burning wreck. And then rose Twilight: not with tender hues, Or choral breezes, but with shade as dim And cold, as Death on youthful spirit throws: Sad grew the air; and soon th' affrighted leaves And branches from the crouching forest sent A wizard moaning, till the wild-bird shriek'd, Or flutter'd, and in dens of deepest gloom The lion shook, and dreadful monsters glared. Tremendous are ye, ever-potent Storms In wild magnificence of sound and scene! Watch'd on the mountains in convulsive play, Or from the ocean-margin when the sea Foams in the fiercest of her billow'd ire. But when hath Tempest, since a deluge roar'd, The pale Earth shaken, like that frenzied storm Which tore the desert, while Messiah mused? Then God to hands infernal seem'd to trust The helm of nature, while a chaos drove The Elements to combat, 'mid the rushing gloom Of rain and whirlwind, in commingled wrath Triumphant, while aloft unnat'ral clouds Hung o'er the sky the imagery of Hell! Not hence alone tempestuous horror sprung: To aid the Tempter, shapes of ghastly light, With Phantoms, grim beyond a maniac's dream, To thunder darkness and dread midnight gave A power unearthly:—round Thy sleepless head Adored Redeemer! did their voices chant, Or wildly mutter some unhallow'd spell; Yet all serene Thy godlike virtue stood, Unshaken, though the universe might fall. Thus, forty days of dire Temptation leagued Their might hell-born, with hunger, thirst, and pain. Meanwhile, in thankless calm the World reposed: Life went her rounds, and busy hearts maintain'd Their action: still uprose the parent Orb, And all the dewy ravishment of flowers Enkindled; Day and Ocean mingled smiles; And then, meek Night with starr'd enchantment rose, While moonlight wander'd o'er the palmy hills Of terraced Palestine: and thus unmark'd By aught portentous, save demonian wiles, His fasting period in the desert-gloom Messiah braved. At length, by hunger rack'd, And drooping, deaden'd by the scorching thirst Of deep exhaustion, round Him nothing stood But rocky bleakness, mountains dusk and huge, Or riven crags which seem'd the wreck of worlds. And there, amid a vale's profoundest calm, Where hung no leaf, nor lived one cheering tone Of waters, with an unappallèd soul The Saviour paused, while arid stillness reign'd, And the dead air, as if by magic quench'd Brooded and thicken'd o'er the lifeless dale. When lo! from out the earth's unfathom'd deep The semblance of a mighty cloud arose; From whence a Shape of awful stature moved,— A vast, a dim, a melancholy Form; Upon his brow the gloom of thunder sat, And in the darkness of his dreadful eye Lay the sheath'd lightnings of immortal ire! In ruin'd glory thus the Demon faced Messiah, cent'ring in that one still glance The hate of Heaven, the agony of Hell, Defiance and despair!—and then, with voice Sepulchral, deep as when a tempest dies, Him thus address'd: “If Son of God Thou be, These stones, command them into living bread!” “'Tis written,” answer'd the most holy Christ, “Not bread alone, but every word of God Is life!” Scarce utter'd that sublime reply, When each ascended, and on noiseless wings Invisibly both God and Demon soar'd. Together, rapid as th' almighty glance Enspheres infinity, on Herod's towers From whose dread altitude the very sky Seems nearer while below a hush'd abyss Extendeth,—dark with supernatural depth,— They soon alighted; where with impious wile Again the Tempter Second Adam tried. “If Son of God Thou be, Thyself cast down! 'Tis written, ‘Thee protecting Angels watch For ever, lest a stone Thy feet may dash.’” “The Lord thy God thou shalt not tempt!” replied The Saviour: awed by such divine repulse, The baffled Demon for his last design Prepared; and swiftly by an airy flight, To Quarantania's unascended top That crowns the wilderness with savage pomp, Messiah next he bore; from thence, a world In visionary pomp lay all reveal'd, By airy portraiture of magic drawn With luring splendour: regions, thrones, and climes Of bloom and fragrance, meadows, lakes, and groves: And there seem'd Cities, capp'd with haughty towers, And Piles, and Palaces of marble sheen, And Domes colossal, with exulting flags Of royal conquest on their gilded spires: And there were Armies, thick as trooping clouds, On plains assembled,—chariot, smoke, and steed, The pomp of death, and thunder-gloom of war: Nor absent, fleets within the silver bay Reposed, or riding o'er a gallant sea: All this, the world's Inspirer thus evoked,— One vast Enchantment, one enormous Scene Of splendour, deluging the dazzled eye With mingled radiance till the fancy reel'd! And then, outstretching with imperial sway A shadowy hand, Hell's crafty monarch spake, “This pomp and glory, this surpassing World Is Thine! if Thou wilt kneel, and worship Me!” Then bright as Deity, with truth erect, Victoriously Messiah thus rebuked That Prince of Hell: “Behind me, Satan, get! 'Tis written, thou shalt worship God alone;” And thus responding, rays of awful truth His Eye emitted; from Whose dreaded glance The Devil shrunk, and wither'd into air! When, light as breezes, lovely as the morn Descended, blooming with celestial grace, Angelic Creatures, in whose hands upborne, By man unseen, the wafted Jesus sank To earth again; and there, a squadron bright Of heaven-born Spirits round Him knelt, and sang. His trial o'er, by men and angels proved Consummate Lord; by John again confess'd Amid the Sanhedrim, as Christ foretold Since time began, by five disciples found And follow'd, Jesus on His glorious task Now enters; fallen Earth shall be restored! Will Kings array him? Shall the Palace ope Its gorgeous portals to admit His train? Alas! the bird his nest, the beast his lair Inhabits, but the homeless Son of Man Forsaken, hath not where His head to lay! And He, Whose fiat was the birth of Things, Whose frown had made the Universe no more, The pangs and woes of meanest want endured; For others wept, and toil'd through tearful gloom, But stood Himself, unaided and alone, A God who suffer'd, while the World he saved. And who can paint him? Oh! the sweetest tone That ever trembled on the harps of Heaven, Melt into muteness, or like discord seem Ere on the summits of celestial love Incarnate, they can reach the Lord of worlds! Be mine, with solemn step and reverent gaze From miracle to miracle to roam, Through paths of glory, tracks of peaceful light; And on the way, devout accession cull Of thought or meaning, from the Book divine Translated: pleased beyond ambition's joy If thus, companion'd by consenting mind, My theme advances, till on Calv'ry's mount Arriving, Faith behold her Saviour die. In mercy, miracles from Christ began. To Cana, peering o'er a woody crest Of green ascent, beside Capernaum raised, Messiah with his Virgin-mother went; And there, by one expressive deed of Love Sanction'd for ever hymenèal Bliss. Unknown the bride, or whom the wedding throng A bridegroom hail'd; but Nature has not seal'd That fountain up, from whence all feeling flows,— The Heart, whose current is by time unchanged. And thus, in garlanded array behold Two happy creatures, 'mid rejoicing friends In white apparel gemm'd by nuptial-flowers. What beautiful emotion, born of dreams Which make the future paradise, abounds! Yet, in thy gaze a gleam of vanish'd years Is mirror'd, maiden! round whose virgin brow A bridal wreath consenting parents wove. The home of love, the haunts where infant feet Have roam'd, with mingled and o'ermastering sense Of truth and tenderness the past awakes, And on thee like returning childhood come. A cloud melts o'er thy summer-noon of joy, Serenely dark, and exquisitely sad: For haply, on the old familiar walls And chamber where thy lispèd vows began Thine eye hath look'd farewell: or down the paths Of garden-loveliness, where tiny hands So often labour'd with delightful toil, How mutely hast thou wander'd!—blessing flowers Whose fairy magic woo'd thy frequent touch When dew and sunshine call'd thy fancy forth To drink their beauty with absorbing gaze; And that green haunt by fragrant trellis hung, Yes! there thy soul hath dream'd of days no more When twilight redden'd o'er thy girlish bowers. But now the banquet: such as lowly roof Demanded, and which simple manners claim'd. O'er milk and honey, rice and kneaded flour, And water, cool as mountain-well contain'd, When consecrating prayer arose for Heaven's High blessing, then the marriage-feast began. But soon to Jesus, Mary's asking eye Was turn'd, and meekly for the aidless want Of friends beloved, a miracle she hoped; But thus was answer'd: “Woman! unarrived My dawn of glory; what have I to do With thee?” Oh! think not from That sinless mouth A mere denial in cold sternness came: The pity, not the anger, of rebuke Was there! Six stony water-pots antique, For pure lavation, such as holy Rite Demanded, in the nuptial chamber stood; And each, obedient to Messiah's voice, With gushing water to the brim was fill'd; When lo! the Element, by power subdued, Blush'd into wine and glow'd beneath its God! And when the ruler of the rustic feast Admiring drank this new-created wine, A miracle stood forth! as shines a star Clear, round, and large, the only one in heaven: Each heart beat louder; on the lifted brow Of mute-struck guests, o'erawed amazement sat; And from the eyes of new disciples flash'd That beaming eloquence all speech beyond, When ecstacy is dumb. And when at night By torch and timbrel home the vested train Return'd, amid the hymenèal songs Of sweetest rapture, while each bridal robe Like snow in moonlight glitteringly shone, The holy mildness of thy deep-toned voice Redeemer! still in hearts its echo rang. Though vaster miracles Thy Name enthrone, In this omnipotently-tender shine The rays of Love; concenter'd, calm, and clear, They dazzle not, but still Thy power declare. With fame before Him, now for Judah's feast Of sacrifice, to Zion's city-queen The Saviour went.—In moods of high romance 'Tis pleasant down the depths of Ages past, To venture, re-erect huge Capitals, And hear the noise of Cities now no more! But Egypt, with her pyramids august, Titanian Thebes, or Athens temple-famed, Or Rome, the once metropolis of earth, And whatsoe'er historic fancy dreams In visions of the vast and gone, dissolve To shadows, when Remembrance pictures thee, Jerusalem! Alas, thy wailing harps Have truly mourn'd; a throneless captive thou! In dust thy robes of beautiful array Have wither'd; tears are on thy faded cheek, And nothing, save a deathless past, is thine! Those Mountains, branded by th' almighty curse, Ascend, and look down yon sepulchral vales, Where silence by the tramp of desert steeds Alone is echo'd: paths of lifeless length, Dim walls, and dusky fanes, barbaric homes And Arab-huts,—how eloquently sad Their ruin, how sublime the tale it tells! Jerusalem! the clank of heathen chains In iron wrath hath sounded o'er thy doom For ages: sword and savage on thy blood Have feasted; fatal martyrdom was thine From Roman, Frank, and fiery Mameluke; E'en now, thy wreck is made an impious prey, And minarets their flashing spires uplift Where once the palace of Jehovah blazed! But round thy desolation lives a dream Of what thou wert, when Heaven o'ershadow'd thee. Religion, fame, and glory—all endow'd With mingled light thy once celestial home. There, 'tween thy Cherubim, Th' Eternal dwelt! From out the Cloud His utter'd meanings came; The hymns of David, and the voice of seers By vision raptured, through thy streets have roll'd; And He, who spake as never mortal did, In temple, home, and synagogue proclaim'd His awful mission:—well might Warriors pause, The Poet chant, and pure Apostles bend Before thee, casting down their sacred wreaths, Queen of the desert! once by angels walk'd, And still where murmurs of Jehovah's lip In dreams of melody thy vales entrance! To such high city came Salvation's Prince, When all was loud, on that religious eve That marks a feast, by whose unblemish'd lamb Was typified the Lamb of God eterne. But, hark! the clang of trumpets on the wind! Down hill and mountain, red with lustrous sky The banner'd Tribes of shouting Israel come: And how magnificently full and deep Their choral anthems! reaching from the heart Through heaven's infinity, where angels list, And waft their echoes round the throne of God. Beneath them, beautiful, and bright, and vast, Jerusalem with all her dazzling towers Reposing; Zion the beloved is there! And midmost, pinnacled in golden pomp O'er all uplift, the gorgeous Temple stands, And glitters, like the sheen of Alpine snow. While downward, jubilant with holy glee, Enamour'd thousands to the city rush: Each window, roof, and balcony, alive With gazers, scattering o'er the marching Tribes A spring of flowers, and wreaths of rosy bloom. While thus, from every region which the heavens O'er-canopy, the host of Israel came In troop and tribe, as though the Archangel's trump Had sounded, Jesus to the Temple pass'd. Nine gates enormous, folding back like clouds Of splendour, when the prince of Morning comes, Round Herod's temple blazed: without, were Courts; And one, the Gentiles', circling with a range Of gleaming columns of colossal height The rest within; and here alone, the Jew To proselytes an entrance gave; nor deem'd That where a Gentile vow'd, Jehovah was! And thus, with unconcern, and loud contempt Of holiness, convened a merchant-throng Of money-changers, in that outer-court, Whose tongue and tread the House of God defiled. Then rose He! like a Hierarch array'd With might celestial; or a fervid seer In the deep passion of prophetic truth On realms and vices warring,—the unknown Redeemer; driving with a wielded scourge The vile profaners, whom His visage awed With sudden brightness of appalling power! “'Tis written,” cried a soul-commanding Voice, “My House the solemn House of prayer shall be, But ye profane it like a den of thieves?” While fled the crowd, a mutt'ring wonder rose, Till one, perusing with an eye of wrath The face of Christ, thus haughtily inquired: “For this high daring, what miraculous sign Or what omnipotence from Heaven hast Thou?” “This Temple scatter, and ere three days end, Command it rise again!”—Then spake the Jew, While o'er the vastness of Jehovah's pile His eye-glance roll'd, and thence with flashing pride On Jesu fell: “Through six-and-forty years This Temple rose, and widen'd! canst Thou crush Its Glory, and in three days bid it rise?” But Christ of His corporeal Temple spake In resurrection-power. Yet words that rung A knell of ruin o'er the noblest Fane Which earth had borne, or gazing awe beheld, Such fatal warning could not be forgiven E'en in that hour of agony divine When shook the World, as pass'd her God away! Eternity! there is a sound and sense Of terror, dwelling in thy dim abyss Of meaning, whether by a Spirit named When lips are whitening in the gasp of Death, Or utter'd by the pensive voice of Life. In vain immunity and calm we seek, Dark intimations of thy state will rise, Though time be mock'd, and tombs unheeded stand.— There was a man whom meditation charm'd And counsell'd, by the Sanhedrim beloved For wisdom; hiving in his inmost heart Prophetic truths, and hopes of regal pride For Judah destined, when her king appear'd. All gloomy, lone, and melancholy things To him were genial: on the face of Death His eye would fasten a devouring gaze, For some confession! down unpeopled haunts At midnight, when the fainting moon retired, Or planets sicken'd, by sepulchral caves Where prince and prophet slumber'd,—he would stray And ponder, dreaming of immortal doom. No spot or scene, where past Religion shed A glory, but to him entrancement gave. On Horeb he had mused, and heard the choir Of Sinai's thunders, heralding their God: On dewy Hermon, loved by David's lyre, And Carmel's oaken top, where trembling stood Elijah, when the cloudy Answer came, He wander'd; and the eagle-haunted heights Of cedar'd Lebanon by him were trod,— That mountain chill'd by everlasting snow, When all the firmament lies bathed in fire. For high revealings of immortal truth His soul was thus attuned; and when the light Of miracles, by Jesu's hand perform'd, His heart illumined, as the risen day Oft suddenly with living splendour cheers The gloom and hollow of deserted vales,— A sudden radiance on his darkness stream'd. Goodness and glory, both in Christ he saw; But in delusions of terrestrial hope Still blindly yearn'd a carnal Throne to see, And scepter'd Judah queen of earth admired! And thus, by ebbing moods of doubt and faith, The Pharisee was sway'd, till Mercy came And led him safely to the Lord, at last. 'Twas on a night of meditative calm, Devoutly while his musing spirit read The story of creation, sin and fall, And second Eden by atoning grace Procured, that impulses of sacred power Moved Nicodemus to consult the Lord. And what an interview that night reveals 'Tween sinful Earth and condescending Heaven! Go, read it, where Eternal Life is found. The second birth of renovated souls Commenced; the Holy Spirit, how He comes The world to sanctify, unseen departs, And worketh like an unbeholden wind, The Lord explain'd; till Nicodemus bow'd In wonder, doubted, trembled, and believed! Since light was born, and condemnation found For deeds of evil, which in darkness lurk And blacken, hating light that brings a God. Then ask not, how the doubter home return'd, Or how his dreams to slumber's Paradise That night was wafted on melodious wing: From this deep hour his heaven of faith began. A Saviour living and a Saviour dead,— For both he pleaded, when the bravest shook, And they who loved Him were the first to flee! When John was prison'd, from those hating Jews Whom miracles confounded, Jesus fled To Galilee; that haunt supremely loved! Where sprung Apostles, where His childhood grew, And where He hasten'd, when from death unbound. Through dells of beauty, hushed and shaded haunts, Or meadows, whiten'd by the olive-boughs That waved and flashed amid the swelling breeze, Through each and all, as Nature's fancy tinged And character'd her glowing realm, He roam'd Till day advanced; and burning, breathless noon, When earth was heated to her inmost core, And light and languishment the brain oppress'd, At Sichem glitter'd round the Saviour's form. Alone, beside a patriarchal well He rested, wearied by the toil intense Of travel; while his fond disciples sought The city, bosom'd in Gerizim's vale. Majestic calm and mournfulness divine Around Him incommunicably reign'd, Like stillness breathed from His eternity: So 'tranced the air, that each minutest sound By wing, or breeze, or basking insect made, Was audible, and seem'd profanely loud: At that deep moment Nature knew her God, And bade the silent Elements adore! While thus, immersed in some immortal dream Of bright salvation, man's Redeemer sat, There came a woman to that haunted well Where holy Jacob, in the dawn of time, Cool'd his hot thirst beneath a zenith sun. A Jew!—of that abhorrent nation sprung, Who, ever since on Dan and Bethel stood Samaria's Idol, bade her miscreant race Of heaven despair, and scorn'd her rival fane, How spake He aught to one of Sichem born! With touching beauty and with tender grace Messiah answer'd, “Had she known the Gift Of God, and who he was, that fain would drink, A living water had divinely flow'd!” His heaven-like mien, and voice augustly toned With spirit-searching power, the woman awed; And nearer still, with eye intently raised, She wond'ring stole, and mortal-like replied; That from the well, o'erhung by solemn boughs Whose shadows oft on patriarchal heads Had play'd, He had not now wherewith to draw, And was He greater than their primal Sire? Alas! the dimness which our being shrouds, To keep us mortal in immortal hours! Of Water springing with eternal Life Whose fountain is the awful soul within, Th' Incarnate spoke; but when the letter still And not the spirit of His words prevail'd, Back from her heart prophetic wisdom roll'd Clouds of dark guilt which there concealment spread, And bare before it laid her life of sin! Then, Conscience! like a voice from other worlds, Sudden and piercing, did thy power appeal To yon frail woman! on her cheek's array Of paleness, in her eyes' dissolving shame It witness'd; and her loudly-beating heart By every throb a pang to memory paid! Then, pointing to Samaria's mountain-fane, Whose massy pomp of pinnacles and towers Rose black and solemn in the cloudless air, She call'd Him, Prophet! and in meekness ask'd Where heaven from earth the purest essence hail'd? From Zion's hill, or where the Fathers knelt,— Gerizim? whence of old from Joshua's lip The full-voiced Blessing by a myriad tongues Was echoed, while from Ebal's blanchèd height A Curse came down, like thunder from the skies. Oh, ye who narrow to the dungeon-walls Of bigotry, the limitless design of Heaven, Approach and tremble!—God a spirit is! And they who worship, must in spirit bend His Throne before! The universal Heart Of Man by revelation's light redeem'd, Jehovah! this Thy purest temple forms. So heard the woman; and a hope confess'd Of coming Glory, in whose morning-beams The night of error would dissolve away. But when Messiah, “I who speak am He!” Responded, mute, and statue-like, she stood,— Embodied wonder! till disciples came And marvell'd, how His purity could speak To one so branded, that her blood was crime! But awe withheld them; and on raptured wings Of speed, to Sychar back the woman rush'd, And, like a prophetess when new-inspired To holy madness, gloryingly cried, Through street and dwelling, “Lo! Messiah comes! A Man who told me all I ever did, The Saviour, by yon well of Jacob sits!” At once, to see the heaven-descended Christ, Up the green valley troop ecstatic throngs, Till thick and fast the mingling shadows fell From young Samaritans, on herbs and flowers, As on they sprang, like birds to meet the morn! While slow behind, the hoary-headed forms Of Age were gliding, pale with wordless joy. “The harvest, say ye not, four months will bring? Behold! the meadows are already white, And he who gathers, reaps immortal fruit!” Thus spake the Saviour, and His welcome high The crowd attracted; dumb with deepest awe They linger'd; not a heart but quaked with bliss Divine, or dreamt it immortality begun: Then lovingly that simple-hearted race The mighty Stranger to their dwellings brought, And fell before Him, in sublime belief Exclaiming, “Thou alone art Christ the Lord!” From Sychar, hence to Cana Christ advanced, And there again shone forth, incarnate God! A Nobleman, around whose only child The shades of death were deepening, at His feet, With all the father mirror'd in his eyes, Sank prostrate; and in tones which tore the heart With dreadful truth, His healing power besought To soothe the madness of parental wo, And back to life a dying son recall. “Thy son is living!” so Emmanuel spake, And he who trusted found his faith's reward! And thus for ever His unwearied Arm Is present, guiding worlds along their paths, Or waved in mercy round the fate of man. But His it was, though all divinely meek Each virtue shone, to drink the bitter Cup! As in the synagogue when call'd, as won't, From out th' assembly, to unroll and read The Haphtoroth, a deaden'd language rose To life upon His lips! there, all in vain The saving wisdom of Messiah spoke: Their eyes were dark, they saw but Joseph's son! But when of miracles for Gentiles work'd Alone, while famish'd Israel droop'd in dust, And on the heavens immitigably seal'd From dawn to midnight turn'd her mournful gaze, When such He mention'd, to convict the soul,— The living frame of that Assembly shook With passion! not an eye but glared revenge! And, fell as tigers, savagely they sprung, And bore Him upward to the rocky hill Where hung their city, down whose awful depth To atoms they would hurl the Saviour-God! But in a moment, by its dizzy brink Each eye was dazzled, and a Power unknown Invisibly that human chaos quell'd! In the full whirlwind of their fiercest ire They soften'd to a breezelike calm, which died To utter stillness, when the crowd beheld Their Victim, passing through the parted throng Unhurt; as he who faced a fiery death And walk'd the furnace with the Son of Man. To thee, Capernaum! by Messiah bless'd And haunted, turn we now our solemn gaze. There, mead and hamlet, mountain, shore, and plain His presence felt, His mighty works enjoyed; While Nature to each theme of glory lent Her own sweet magic, imagery, and power. And seest thou, girdled in by barren wilds, Yon blue expanse? Gennesareth is there! Quiescent now as meditation's hour Yon lake of beauty in the noontide gleams; But when a hurricane with Syrian roar Descends the mountain, and its calm defies, Then, Chinnereth! thy sleeping might awakes; And yon deep billows with disastrous swell In hollow thunder to the winds respond. By the bright waters, on that lovely beach Of famed Tiberias, where a wondering crowd Around Him panted for immortal truth, Was Jesus standing; while the fisher wash'd His net, and dried it on the pebbled shore. Two silent vessels on the lake reposed; The one He enter'd, and the people taught; But ere the music of His mighty words Was still'd, “Launch forth! and let your nets descend,” The Lord commanded: worn by fruitless toil, All doubtingly did Peter's hand obey: But when at once, with its enormous load The net uprose, till e'en the laden ship Beneath her living burden sank, and reel'd, Silence adored! the tongueless air was hush'd, As though Creation wonder'd! till, a cry Yon multitude from off the shore awoke, Which scatter'd silence like a broken dream! While Peter, quivering with unearthly dread, Fell in amazement at Messiah's feet And utter'd, “Leave me, Lord! for I am vile!” That moment his Apostleship began For ever: death and darkness, time and wo, From Faith's high throne he overlook'd them all! Then James and John at once that Power revered To Whom the Elements their laws resign'd, And laid their sceptres down. Of old prevail'd The Prayer of prophets, for the sick and dead Arising; but a Word that ruled the waves And master'd ocean with creative might, Had ne'er till now a lip on Earth inspired! To this high deed, an unrecorded mass Of miracles, in one successive throng Was added: when the sun's expiring gleam Paled o'er Capernaum, round Messiah's door Disease assembled all her ghastly troop Of martyrs: in an instant, ere a sound Could perish, Health's untainted blood return'd! The lame and sightless, palsied, deaf, and dumb Recover'd, fleet as resurrection's change; And thus, by deed embodying all Isaiah sung, Through town and village the Redeemer went And rested never from His glorious toil; Except when God th' incarnate Son adored, As oft He did in melancholy wilds, Where, all unseen, the Man of Sorrows knelt And sanctified His human will by prayer. And must we sink, in lifeless wonder lost 'Mid the pure radiance of such perfect deeds? The power, but not the principle sublime Is hidden, whence creation's ruling Lord Each miracle derived;—and that is Love, Which link by link connects a thousand worlds, And chains them all to one Almighty Throne! For true example, not inactive awe, Messiah lived; and he who soars to Him That living Orb of Righteousness beholds, Whose beams are catholic with boundless grace And sunlike fall on universal Man.

How beautiful the soul's religious calm When thought is heavenward, and the chainless mind Like soaring Enoch, to our God ascends! And oh! how glorious, by deep vision led, Six thousand years to travel back and view How from the cradle of eternity The infant-world at God's command arose. The new-born winds, the ocean's young delight Heard in a rhapsody of rolling waves; With every tint and motion, gleam or glance Of life and matter, from the lyric host Of Stars, with quiring gratulation loud, To fairy insect and minutest flower,— On each and all Imagination dreams, When Earth lay basking in Jehovah's smile! But what is this, or all th' amazing stream Of glories, terrors, and supernal acts Of truth and judgment, down the mighty page Devolved, to thine all-wondrous Plan, Redemption? Vast beyond the vastest dream That circles round the comprehending soul, Thy range extendeth! Nature's utmost bounds, From earth to heaven, from heaven to higher worlds, And higher still, beyond the furthest reach Of finite thought to mention or conceive, Immensity, and all Eternal Power Created, forms, or may hereafter free,— Redeemer! over all Thy glories reign! But lo! the Mount, whereon Messiah sat And taught; while multitudes with lifted gaze And soul that listen'd with suspended breath, Beneath Him swarm'd, to drink eternal Life Whose fountain issued from the Throne of God. The Spring was forth: young loveliness and bloom Her reign attested; trees and meadows flash'd With verdant lustre, while the shaken flowers Their scent and beauty to the breeze resign'd With playful murmur. From its sacred top A bright extent of ever-changing view The beatific Mount o'ergazed: from thence, Gilboa, where amid the chariot-rush Of Philistines, the dying Saul despair'd, Was seen to lift her Pyrenèan crags And cloud-like spires; Gennesareth's azure mass Of waters, and the snow-clad Hermon's height Conspicuous beam'd; and all which gave To hallow'd words an instantaneous glow Of life and feeling, full before Him lay. Bethuliah to a thousand eyes appear'd, When Jesus of the hill-throned City spake; The lily-flowers, which neither toil nor spin, Yet, beautiful beyond arrayèd Solomon! In golden freshness on the meadows waved; And when on providential Care alone He bade terrestrial Want repose, and cried, “Behold the fowls your heavenly Father feeds!” Their wings exulted on the air around And nerved the precept with example's force. Oh, what a scene of heart-affecting power Was there beheld!—That consecrated Mount On whose green summit sat the Son of Man; The words he utter'd; deep and awful tones, Yet tender in their might, as mellow'd-sounds From Ocean's lip; with all unclouded spring Of fresh and fair commandeth; and the crowds Which hung like bees upon the mountain-side, As thick and numberless, yet hush'd and chain'd To utter calm, as though their living mass Together breathed but one absorbing soul,— Religion! thou wert throned in godlike pomp Amid a scene transcendently endow'd Like this, with attributes of holy might Beyond the Temple in its costliest hour. And what a doctrine of almighty depth Messiah founded, when His truth declared, In meekness lies the majesty of Man! At once the Wisdom of the world was dumb, And Mammon blighted on his throne of bliss. The ways of pleasantness, the paths of peace Are dim and narrow, tracks of noiseless gloom Which Glory flies, and Grandeur seldom walks: The poor in spirit, and the meek in heart Who thirst and hunger for Thy righteous Word, Oh! these are blest, for Thine unerring Voice Hath call'd them so, and crown'd their lowly Lot, And sanctified its unrebellious tear. To them divinely was the blessing given; And while in shed or cottage, swamp or wild, The sacred pangs of Poverty endure, There Goodness and her Lord may constant meet, And Charity, with soft and silent foot, Move like an Angel to a deed of heaven. And vaster Truths, unspeakably divine, Which live before the Throne, and light effuse O'er all who worship their immortal Source, Did Christ reveal:—of uncomplaining Love, Forgiving, as it hopes to be forgiven; Of Sanctity, within the spirit shrined; Of Passion, rooted from terrestrial ties And trampled as the soul's unhallow'd weed; Of alms in secret,—temples in the mind Where God in dedicated moments comes To earth unknown, and needs no trumpet-voice To tell the world a conscious sinner prays; Of Providence, life's angel, ever nigh, Who feeds the bird, and robes the meadow-flower; Of lofty hope, of meditative peace, And feeling, touch'd with man's infirmity, O'ercoming wrong with mercy's tender gaze That looks aside when human error falls, But loves a virtue in its frailest hours,— Of these He spake, and taught believing Man A worship, which eternal Wisdom loves. E'en Him, whom yonder choir of worlds Adores, our faltering tongues may Father call!— Glory of glories! can archangels boast A voice, or language of mysterious love Surpassing this, which bids “our Father” sound From lip of mortals, when a soul renews Her solemn intercourse with God on high? Give ear, O Heaven! thou wondering Earth, be still, For here is love so measureless and deep, That Feeling staggers, and Expression fails, Or ventures only, “let Thy will be done!” Oh! long as man upon creation moves, In solemn aisles of monumental gloom Ascending with a loud melodious swell, In rustic fane, or tranquil home beloved, By hoary age, or lisping childhood breathed, From cave or desert, dungeon, rock, or sea,— That mighty Prayer upon the mountain taught To Heaven and Jesus may it ever rise, And win the Mercy it was framed to woo. His task is o'er, the sacred Teacher gone, And the last murmur of descending feet Dies on the hill; where now a breeze awakes The spring-born flowers, till livingly they stir And tremble into low sweet song again. But all the host who heard immortal Truth Upon the beatific Mount declared Are vanished, like the dew of yesterday! And thrones and states and Babylonian piles Have wither'd; Dust has claim'd its dead For ever, quenching in sepulchral sleep The Earth's unquiet generations gone; Yet, pure as perfect, Christ's majestic Law High o'er the wreck of Men and Things endures, And will,—till heaven and earth dissolve away! What toils and agonies, what glorious tears And blessed pangs by penitence sublimed, The earth has known, though unrecorded left! O History, thou hast done the world a wrong Immense and mournful; on the alpine heights Of human Greatness, thine enamour'd gaze Has linger'd; mindless in that partial mood Of meek-eyed Virtue, in the vale below! And robed thy themes of darkness with a veil Of bright attraction, as the Thunder wraps His ruin oft in clouds of gorgeous spell. Yet better far, had thy pervading glance From earthly pomp to scenes of heavenly truth Descended; marking how the Saviour's word Had triumph'd, how it lived in lonely hearts And aching bosoms, weeded daily life Of sin and wo, and dried the widow's tear.— Sublime of Sermons! atheistic tongues Have bless'd thee, and the worldling's rocky soul Gush'd into tears beneath thy tender sway: When life is gladness, or when sorrow flings A sudden autumn o'er the leaves of joy, The purest homily of peace and love Wisdom has utter'd since the world began! But thou, Capernaum! once again the Arm Almighty bares itself for thee, and thine Oh, misbelieving Land! to heaven upraised And hell cast down.—A grim and ghastly wreck, Upon his face beneath Messiah's feet A Leper falls, there, lifts his bloodshot gaze, And with a voice of choked and dying tone His help implores:—From Egypt's fiery realm The dread corruption came, when burning noon Flamed o'er the limbs of Pharaoh's toil-worn slaves; And now, a victim of its direst rage The Son of Man beheld. Each sign accursed Disease had printed on his mouldering form; Till fruit had wither'd in the hot embrace Of each infected hand!—let Fancy shrink, But still a martyrdom of nature see, Then, picture how the Lord of Being look'd, When graciously His godlike hand approach'd, The Leper touch'd, and with a word divine Commanded, “Be thou clean!” and lo! he sprang To earth again, a free and perfect man And pure as childhood in its glowing prime! For, health with instantaneous gush o'erflow'd His being; like the world's untainted Sire He stood in glory, eyeing earth and heaven As though his spirit would encircle all! And well might gratitude obedience quench; On wings, that seem'd round every limb to play, O'er mount and vale th' ecstatic Creature fled, A living miracle: and cried aloud “A God! a God! His mighty cure behold!” Roused into motion, like autumnal leaves By wind invoked, a rushing Host that cry Re-echoed: onward with exulting speed To fall in worship round th' Almighty Priest They came: but not in Him, the loud uproar Of shouting numbers, nor the false delight Of glory flashing over envious eyes, Nor crown, nor throne upon the dying breath Of sudden wonder raised,—acceptance found. The shady desert, and the dark-bough'd wild Again He haunted; there, amid the calm Of Nature, hush'd by some instinctive awe, Alone The Everlasting pray'd, and thought. But, vain seclusion! through the verdant depth Of solemn woods the rush of thronging feet Advanced; and voices, with a sea-like roar Confused and clashing, round the Saviour roll'd: 'Twas then, escaping from the countless herd, Upon the Lake His prompt disciples launch'd Their bark, and bore the great Redeemer on. Far o'er the blue and rippled waters sail'd The boat; serene as yonder twilight-cloud It moved, whose haven was the ruddy west. In pillow'd slumber on the silent deck The Son of Man reposed: sublimely calm His features in the light of evening shone; And oft entranced, some fond disciples stood To gaze upon His holy sleep, and draw Transcendent meanings from that Face Divine! But ere the Twilight, and her fairy crowd Of splendours, melted in the dark embrace Of night, with soul intent the seamen heard The incantations of a Storm begin! The air was toned with sadness, like a sigh Of broken hearts, or moan of guilty dreams When Midnight is confessor: o'er the Lake A breezy and a sudden life arose, Till ripples flash'd, and bubbling foam began To whiten o'er the waters. In the sky No mercy dawns; for all is scowling there, And savage clouds are in funereal march Benighting heaven with one enormous gloom. But hark! with ominous array it comes,— Creation's tyrant! list the Tempest howls; The South-East sends her hurricane, and back The Jordan in affrighted motion rolls: The Lake is heaving with convulsive throes And billows writhe in agonising play Loud o'er the surface, till like living Shapes Of water battling with the Winds they seem In liquid thunder, wheresoe'er they move! In that wild hour, while star nor moon reveal'd A solace, and the only light which gleam'd, Shone when red lightning with a wizard flash Call'd the dun mountains into dreary form And station,—then the pale disciples ran And cried, “We perish! save us, Lord! arise!” He heard; He rose; and while the vessel creak'd, And cordage rattled in the roaring gale Like wither'd branches in a forest-wind, Till o'er the deck the climbing billows rush'd And darken'd round her with devouring yell, His hand He waved, the rolling storm rebuked, The Tempest knew her God,—and still'd! Then o'er Tiberias, calm as cradled sleep, The Moon uprose; and in her silver hue Each cloud dissolved, as angry feeling dies By music overcome; and once again The doubting crew their wingèd bark beheld, With stars above, and star-lit waves beneath, Serenely gliding on to Gadarene: Oh! then, amid that elemental trance The meek reproach of their forgiving Lord Was felt; each gazed on each with holy fear; The calm of Nature grew a fearful charm; For Sea and Air with more than language cried “The waters hear Him, and the Winds obey!” The shore is reach'd; but what unearthly Shape, What Thing accurst, in human semblance clothed, Foaming and wild, with eyeballs sternly fix'd, Glares on them, like a cavern'd brute aroused By errant footsteps, when her whelps are nigh? O Prince of Darkness! and ye Powers of Air By Heaven permitted, from the fiery doom Of Hell's abyss, to roam the peopled earth A while, and enter in the breathing frame Of mortals, maddening with demonian rage Both blood and spirit,—there, your victim stands! Thou dreaded martyr! words and feelings fly Aghast, or shudder round thy gloomy pangs: Thy limbs are bare, and down their wither'd length The blood has track'd the lacerating stone Tormented Madness from the hills hath wrung To glut her agony! Among the tombs Thy dwelling is; from human face apart, The dead around thee in sepulchral caves Of rocky darkness,—there thy spirit moans, Or mutters, till the very mountains seem Appall'd to echo with thy blasphemy! But, dreader far, when night's dominion came To hear thy howlings! e'en the desert-beast Hath trembled, when the horrid echoes rang; While, pillow'd on a sleeping mother's breast, The infant shook to think thy shadow nigh! Thus stood the foaming maniac, while there glared The terror of his demon-haunted eyes Through each disciple's heart!—but, ere a limb Could move, that dreadless Voice, which made The roaring Tempest mute, and never spake But Heaven was raptured, and profoundest Hell With agonies of coming doom convulsed Or shaken,—like omnipotence arose: “Come forth, defiler!” and the spirit fell In kneeling torture at Messiah's feet! There, “By the living God!” dark Legion cried, “Thou Jesus! Son of the Most High! adjured, Before our time torment us not! nor plunge Our spirits in th' Infernal Deep again, But let us enter in yon mountain-prey.” When thus permitted, like a gentle dawn His soul emerged, and spread each vital hue Of nature o'er the freed demoniac's frame. And when the crowding Gadarenes advanced In gazing terror round Messiah's form No bleeding maniac from the rocky tombs They witness'd, but a man renew'd and mild, From Hell deliver'd, at the feet of Christ Reposing, with his native vesture clad: And as he sat, how superhuman seem'd The great Restorer! thanks in wonder died; But what a language in his lifted eye, Whose words were tears, the eloquence of joy! Divine perfection of embodied Love, Supremely fair, insufferably bright, By Thee, the Muse is dazzled! all is deep August, and holy, where Thy presence rules; The bigot tamed, the hypocrite unmask'd, The Law illumed, and blinded Israel taught The darkness of exclusive faith was o'er, And light celestial, from the depths of God Would soon irradiate universal Man. Him, Son of Alpheus! though the luring world Had long enchain'd thee, thou didst not refuse, When, “Follow me” fell sudden on thine ear, And thou wert his, by deathless grace redeem'd. But what awaits us? Let maternal Hearts Whose pulse beats love, approach and tell, Oh life! how beautiful thy maiden-bloom In that bright morn, when youth's unfolded years Like rising veils before enchantment spread, Recede, and down a fairy vista roams The glancing joy of Expectation's eye! Then day by day, as some meek violet rear'd By fondling sunshine, grows the virgin Mind In home's retreat, till childhood melts away, And dawning Womanhood her smile begins. Then all is fair; affection's graceful smile From out a purity of spirit plays, And life and motions, inspirations are Which tone the voice, or teach the step delight; And frowning Sorrow, though it shade the cheek, The soul can darken not, whose placid tears Melt as they rise, like tender dews of wo. Romance is true, reality a dream, And cares,—oh! what are they, but minute-clouds That speck the ether of our calmest life! And canst thou, Death! congenial dungeons quit Where thou art woo'd by dark and wretched men, To come where Youth and Loveliness unite Their magic, and the breath of life is joy? Alas! the knells, that with diurnal grief The wind intone; alas! the frequent pall, The church-yard tales on tomb and stone rehearsed, A blinded chamber, or that weeping Home Where round some coffin drooping parents bend, Like marble shapes of monumental Wo, Thy victims tell, thy savage choice reveal! Then think, if in bereavement's blackest hour, When flooding agonies the brain o'erwhelm, And a last gaze seems looking life away, The parted spirit of the Dead return'd!— For such the scene, by Revelation drawn. On Jairus Heaven an only child bestow'd; A lovely scion, round whose being twined The clinging fondness of parental fear. For beautiful as Syria's lonely flowers, That wave and murmur on the shady top Of wooded Lebanon, her form had grown From infancy, till now revealing time Had written woman on her vestal cheek. Born in that Land where summer's pregnant beam Was brightest, where the fruits of Eden hung, And the rich mulberry spread a snowy bloom, While grapes empurpled every terraced hill, Her shape and spirit magic influence caught From Syria's clime of glory. Nature's grace By power of exquisite attraction seem'd Reflected from it; light and beauty fill'd Her soul, and flash'd from those irradiate eyes; And walk'd she not, as Israel's daughter would, The mighty scenes where patriarchal feet Had trodden, where the God of Zion spake! Lake, fount, and river, and those Mountains three Which camp'd her warriors, and that still o'erlook Esdraelon's plain, where tented Arabs dwell, Around whose home, when dewy nightfall comes, The gamb'ling flocks to reedy murmurs play,— From each and all pure inspiration sprung, And told, how beautiful religion look'd By youth entempled in a spotless heart! And yet on her, with vestal radiance clad, Infection breathed, and poison'd blood and brain, Till the rich bloom of animation died. Her form was blighted; and her faded cheek The pallid certainty of coming doom Betray'd: oh, hear it, Heaven!—a father's prayer The sky ascends to claim a brighter hope: Away, with agonising speed he flies, Nor treads the ground, nor hears the city-roar, Nor feels the motion of his moving limbs! Condensed, and darken'd into wild despair His soul became, till Nature's functions fail'd, And earth was reeling from his dazzled gaze, When full amid the pharisaic throng He rush'd, and prostrate with a burst of wo, Voiced his dread agony with this deep cry, “My daughter, Lord! her deathful pangs approach, But hasten! touch her with Thy healing hand And yet my child shall live:” ere Jesus came Her spirit vanish'd, like a lovely sound! The house of mourning!—hark, the funeral-dirge, The doleful flutes, and dying melodies Of instrumental tone, or wailing yells Of frantic Grief, and mercenary Wo. But, enter! there in yon sepulchral room, Alone a childless mother comes to seal The lids of Death, and on that marble lip Imprint a long and last—the parting kiss! And shall the worm of putrefaction feed On that young form, of Beauty's finest mould? The light and life of twelve enchanted years, All sunk and shaded in remorseless dust! Oh agony! could thawing tears the soul Dissolve, let suffering Nature shed them now. While o'er thy cheek, so eloquently pale, Once full of rosy life, her bending eye With dreadful speculation broods, beloved And blessed! all thy winning ways and smiles, Thy look and laugh, in one sweet throng, return Upon her, till thy warm and living breath Again is playing round Affection's heart! But ah! her martyr'd frame's convulsive heave, As if in that chaotic gloom of mind When feeling is our only faith, the soul Would rive the body and at once be free,— Betokens thou art death, and she despair! Believe, and fear not: in the blackest cloud A sunbeam hides; and from the deepest pang Some hidden mercy may a God declare. There as she stood, delirous, rack'd, and wild, The Saviour enter'd, and his soothing glance Fell on the mother's torn and troubled heart As moonlight on the ocean's haggard scene. The wailing minstrel, and the dirge of death, He bade them cease; “The maiden is not dead, But sleepeth!” Then around her vestal couch The mourning parents, with His chosen Three, Advanced, and in the midst, divinely calm, The son of Man! In lifeless beauty laid, A loveliness and not the gloom of death The virgin wore; and on her placid cheek The light of dreams reposed: oh, ne'er could dust A purer sacrifice from Death receive! But when He stoop'd, and held her icy hand, And utter'd, “Maid, arise!” the beating heart Of wonder, doubt, delight, and awful fear Was hush'd; for, swift as echo to the voice Replies, the spirit of the dead awoke At His high summons! whether from the arm Of Angels, lock'd in some oblivious trance; Or from the bloom and breath of Paradise Amid beatitude to earth recall'd, To us untold; enough for man to know That when the Lord of resurrection spake The soul return'd! And mark its dawning glow; Soft o'er each deaden'd cheek the rosy light Of cherub slumber steals; the eyes unfold And lift their veiny lids, as matin-flowers When dew and sunshine fascinate their gaze; In red and smiling play the lips relax, And, delicate as music's dying fall, The throb of life begins; she moves! she breathes! The dead hath risen, and a living child Sinks on the bosom of maternal Love! From hence, to Galilee the Prince of Life Again retreated; there His Own beloved Received Him not, but savagely repell'd The Nazarene; alas! they little dreamt Of shrouded glory ark'd in Mary's Son! But from the vain, whom pomp alone allured, To multitudes of meek and aidless men Who, faint and scatter'd, for instruction pined, And tractable, the mild Redeemer turn'd. Upon the mountain, when a night of prayer Had pass'd, and awful Invocation knelt, The Twelve were chosen, seal'd and heaven-inspired, And yet, how poor!—a Galilèan tribe By man untaught, to Science all unknown. But not as ours, are Thine unfathom'd ways Jehovah! in the mean Thy might display'd Its vastness; on the low Thy lofty truth Descended; out of weakness wisdom sprung, As light from darkness, worlds from nothing, came! And these were living Oracles, whose voice Was power, whose doctrine breathed eternal life! To them was portion'd this almighty Task, “Advance! though Hell's dark legions rise, advance! And preach the kingdom of approaching Heaven. Nor gold, nor silver, raiment, staff, nor scrip, Provide, but enter ye the city-gates; The lame restore, the dead recal, the blind Illumine, cleanse the leper, heal the sick, And hurl the Demon from the haunted soul. Be wise as serpents, innocent as doves; Beware of all, but flatter none; for Thrones Shall tremble, and the cheek of Kings Look blasted, and your words of lightning cleave The spirits which appal ye, when the lash Is loudest, and the blood of trial flows. Advance, and fear not! for your very hairs Are number'd; viewless, God your Guardian is, And he who offers to the parchèd lip A cup of water, him will I repay!” And did they not, by living grace empower'd, The Earth evangelise, till idols shook Before them, and the gates of hell were storm'd? Its truthful witness let the solemn Past Uplift, and there, along the boundless scene Of time departed, shines the glorious track Of true Apostles! On their heads the curse Was wreak'd, and fires of persecution rain'd; Their limbs were torn, around them dungeons gaped, And yet, they ceased not; still the cry was heard, “Redemption! on the Cross a Saviour hung; Repent, believe, and be for ever blest!” Transcendent martyrs! round your awful brows Seraphic wreaths are twined, and ye adore, In throned array, the Co-Eternal Three! But with your presence, not your power sublime Departed; still around us in their might, Recorded mercies miracles and truths Divine, are breathing: by whose vital sway Are sanction'd all which daily Life enjoys Of charity, protection, faith, and peace; The light of Laws, the Liberty of home, Content, and all that makes a Country dear. From what high armory, celestial Band! Were your bright weapons taken? Was your creed A pliant courtier, bending to the will Tyrannic, culling from each varied clime, Or doctrine, some accordant hue to please A passion, flatter doubt, or soothe despair? Or, did ye, by undaunted truth sublimed, Like second Daniels and Elijahs prove And brand the vices of corrupted man? Against the Passions, wheresoe'er they ruled, Ye march'd, and fought them in their fiercest shape Of Lust and Pride, and dark Ambition's dreams, And Hopes which make eternity a lie By moulding heaven to each infirm desire. O traveller! far from England's elmy dales To Syria wafted, in the trance of noon When thou art seated on some rocky cliff Of Nazareth, and think'st that there, unknown, In meek subjection lived the Son of Man, Till came the hour when like a buried stream Of glory bursting into sudden day, That mighty Doctrine which embraced a world Rose into light, and ran its vast career,— What visions o'er thy musing spirit roll? The flood of centuries, in their fancied roar Thou hears't them sweeping! but amid the tides Of desolation over king and kingdom pour'd, The “Rock of Ages,” based on earth indeed But towering to the skies,—unshaken stands, Deep as eternity and high as heaven! But now, from everlasting triumph fresh And ardent, met the apostolic Band Once more around Him; then to lovely Nain By Hermon shaded, o'er whose dazzling snow A mid-noon burn'd, the godlike Jesus went. Whoe'er thou art, a scene of touching might And tender beauty waits thy spirit there. And yet, how simple! such as link mankind Together by unbroken ties of soul,— The glories of the Gospel! from the heart They spring, and to the heart alone appeal With eloquence divine. Behold, as noon Was calming down from its meridian heat, And Tabor o'er Esdraelon's verdure threw A longer shade, where cooling Kishon ran His midway course, the Lord of mercy reach'd That mountain-dell where Nain of Hermon stands: But ere He enter'd, came a mournful troop In dark procession from the city-gates. The air was rung with anguish; and the dirge Fell sad and frequent on Messiah's ear: While midmost, on a mantled bier upborne, A youth was carried to an early grave, An only child, the Star of widow'd home In whose fond ray a mother's spirit smiled! With what a sense of beautiful delight Her ear drank in the father's fancied voice, Still in her son triumphant o'er the tomb! How tenderly her soul's creative eye Gazed on the meanings of his manly face And made each feature all the sire restore In proud resemblance! while a sacred hope Survived, that when her widow'd race was done, His hand would smoothe, his gentle voice attend Her dying bed; and tears of filial truth Fall on the flowers which graced a mother's tomb! But Heaven had frown'd, her living star was set, In the bright morning of its beauty gone For ever. Pity! thine are barren tears, And unrefreshing as the thunder-drops On burning sands, to wo intense as this! For life and feeling in the grave descend; And sounds of comfort, like the clamorous waves In heedless revel o'er the ocean-dead, Awake no echoes in her spirit now. But on they come, the sad funereal crowd, And deep o'er all the blended tones of grief A heart-wrung widow's lamentations rise Distinctive of the Mother! Not a gaze By feeling unbedewed; the young men weep, As fancy pictures, on yon cover'd bier Their pale companion, from whose mirthful brow So many a gleam of young enjoyment flash'd Like daily sunshine over kindred hours: The aged bow their heads, to dreams of death Surrender'd; parents muse on buried hopes, Or clasp the living with a fearful joy! And e'en the children, as the mourning-train Advances, from unthinking revel cease And sadden down the innocence of glee. 'Twas then the Lord of Life and Death approach'd The long procession, and a widow's tear Was mighty, for it thrill'd Emmanuel's soul! At once, majestic through the yielding crowd Beside the corse He came, the bier He touch'd, Then, moveless as the dead that living host Stood silent; every throbbing breeze grew loud, And motions of the human heart were heard In the deep hush of this portentous hour! The awful coming of some dread Display Each soul awaited: then was heard, “Arise!” The spirit answer'd, and that youth arose; And to his mother took Messiah's hand Her only child! Oh, ask not, what excess Of rapture, what ecstatic shriek of joy, What thrilling fires of new affection rose When heart to heart the beat of life return'd, As there they stood, unutterably blest, Each twined round each, affection's holy pair! The mountain-top, though daring clouds retreat Below it, oft victorious feet ascend; And down the ocean have undaunted eyes Descended; but the height and depth of Love Maternal, who shall meet its boundless sway? But, rather witness how one eager gaze From the vast multitude's concentred awe Is bent on Jesus! dreadful light enrobes His Form, divinity His features wear, And as He moves, in loud hosannahs rise, “Our God hath visited His people now!” And thus, whene'er the tears of Woman fall, Compassion! in the Lord of pity view Thy godlike Semblance. Never from His lip The crushing heartlessness of cold rebuke Descended, when the soul of woman cried! And was not this example? Ere the tongue Can utter, or the eye a wo reveal, Her smile is round us, like a guardian-spell Which nothing scatters, save the tyrant-gloom Of death; and then, whose unforsaking glance, Till the last hue of being fade, from dawn To midnight keeps angelic watch beside The ebbing spirit, lighting it to heaven? 'Tis Action makes the world of man; but life Is feeling, such as gentler woman bears; The fairy people of her inward world Are true affections; when the blight hath touch'd Or wrong'd their beauty, darkly cold this earth Becomes, the elements of being fade, And silence is the sepulchre of thought Wherein the anguish of her spirit dwells. But should there yet some icy soul remain Which never melted at a woman's tear, Let such advance, and meet The Saviour's eye! Behold a chamber; round a simple board, On circling couches, with unsandal'd feet Reclined, a pharisaic throng convened; Amid them, the Redeemer: as He lay, Behind him crept a penitential form Of faded beauty; years had fiercely traced, And chronicled with Time's disastrous pen The countless agonies of guilty wo On her pale visage, from whose haggard eyes The tears gush'd big and bright, while down her neck In flowing ringlets fell unheeded hair Of blackest lustre:—in her hand appear'd An alabaster box of rich perfume. But when her flood of anguish on the feet Of Christ intruded, with her flowing hair The tears she dried, and costly unction pour'd: Divinely humbled, That mysterious Head She would not dare profane! but, sin-abash'd, Upon his feet alone an ointment due She pour'd, the sad and silent Magdalene! On her, as some mute parent's pensive gaze The home-returning child of Error greets, Messiah look'd; but from the scorner's eye A scornful flash of indignation broke, To think a vile corruption, frail as she, Might touch a Prophet, or communion hold With mortal Sanctity! Yet, ere contempt Grew vocal, He whose comprehensive glance Both heaven and earth and time and space commands, And from the dungeon of the darkest soul The craven thought with sudden light expels, The brooding rancour of self-righteous man Perceived, and thus the hidden soul unmask'd: “Two debtors once a creditor forgave; Five hundred one, the other fifty pence. Which loved him most?” “The one forgiven most,” The cowering Pharisee at once replied, With curling lip, and brow which blacker grew! “Behold yon woman! she hath loved the most, And is the most forgiven!” Deadly rage At those high words, which to Jehovah's lip Belong'd, and character'd almighty power, How fiercely did that proud assembly feel! They spake not; but the blood's resentful ire Flow'd on each visage with a fiery rush Of inward passion, while derisive tones Around the table murmuringly ran,— That He, a throneless Heir of mortal clay, The sanction of tremendous God assumed, And pardon'd one by pharisaic creed Accursed, whose presence was defiling breath, Than whom, for their celestial robe to touch To hug the Pestilence were purer far! In deep soliloquy of hate and dread So mutter'd each dark soul; but, mildly firm, Emmanuel then to weeping Mary cried “By faith forgiven, in thy peace depart!” Again Jerusalem's Mosaic feast Return'd, and Christ within her hoary walls Hath enter'd, and beside Bethesda's pool Unknown amid the lazar-crowd appears, Beneath the porches lying. Round the bath A pillared shade five towering cloisters threw Where each with ravenous impatience eyed The blood-stain'd waters! panting for the hour Medicinal, when some high Angel stirr'd That healing Pool: as oft a summer-lake Convulsively a thrilling breeze attests, Bethesda rippled into mystic life Beneath the wave of His unshadow'd wings. Amid the martyrs, pale o'er all the rest, And ghastly, bearing on his palsied frame The loathsome curse of eight-and-thirty years' Dread malady, an aidless Victim met Divine compassion, when his Lord approach'd. “Wilt thou be whole?” the Great Physician cried: “My limbs are moveless! lo, the crowd advance Down in the waters ere my weakness come.” As man to man, that pining creature spake; But when, “Arise, thy bed uplift, and walk,” Commanded Jesus, limb and life renew'd Their freshness! free as Samson in his hour Of glory, with his couch the man uprose, While magic blood like streaming rapture ran From vein to vein, how exquisitely felt! He walk'd, but not unenvied; savage frowns Were seen, and stern the loud resentment rose: “A broken Sabbath! did it not condemn The cure? That burden, was it not profane!” The rebel heart of Jewish envy cried. Thou hypocrite! let days and seasons quench Thy soul, and narrow down the lofty creed Of true Religion: vital worth ascends Beyond them; goodness is a godlike power And active; it can lead an angel-life, But keeps a holy calendar in heaven. Celestial Founder of the Christian faith, Saviour of spirits! Thy denouncing words Have been fulfill'd: the race who mock'd Thy deeds And darken'd all Thy bright perfection did Of good and wond'rous for afflicted Man, The cup of wrath have drench'd, and are become The scoff and vileness of our peopled globe! But have we not Thy sacred Word defiled, Thy Law profaned, the light of Truth repell'd, And often crucified Thee o'er again Lamb of the World! Descend, O Lord! descend And lighten, as Thou didst the Jews of old, The dimness of our nature! Still remain The curse of Sect, the bigotry of hate, And Doctrines impious whose exclusive lie Would limit God, and shut the gates of heaven! The pure and open, the unbounded scheme Of Earth's redemption, let not man presume To shape or alter; but submissive faith The grand relationship of human Souls Confess; and while external Sense reveres Each hallow'd Rite, let inward love abound, And centre all its paradise in Thee: So will religion spread, and time record The days of Eden, sabbaths of the mind When dream and doctrine, hope and faith unite To make the heart anticipated heaven. Where Jordan mingled his melodious wave With the blue waters of that famous Sea Which often mirror'd the Redeemer's form, The grassy desert of Bethsaida lay. To this deep wild the Lord of Glory went Dejected, for the murder'd Baptist's fate A veiling sadness o'er His spirit threw. But such a halo of pure light begirt His Person; wisdom so surpassing flow'd From perfect lips, that sooner might the sun At flaming noontide from the eye recede, Than Christ in unregarded loneness rest. And lo! around Him, like a wilder'd flock Of mountain-sheep, unshepherded and lost, The poor have gather'd; and their pleading eyes Were overpower'd, when Incarnate Wisdom spake Of Time and Nature, man's undying soul, And Blood mysterious that would cleanse the world: Till deep entrancement on each spirit came, Serene as starlight o'er a dusky lake Of troubled water:—hunger, want, and toil Were unremember'd in th' absorbing bliss Of vast instruction; on the Bread of Life They feasted, mindless of all other food! But day was dying; and the mellow light Of evening slanted through the desert-boughs, Whose leafy motion, like a refluent tide The pebbles chafing, made a restless sound. And when Messiah in the pallid gleam Of western sunlight mark'd the wearied host Before Him, and a thousand faces turn'd Full on His gaze, all famish'd, feeble, worn!— Compassion for their uncomplaining want Awoke; at once a miracle sublime His soul conceived, His mighty hand perform'd. Among the multitude a lad was found; Five barley loaves and two small fishes made His poor possession; but that scanty meal Became abundance to creative Power! By fifties rank'd, along the verdant ground The people sat, with expectation dumb, And trembling with profoundest awe! Then took The bread, and lifted His majestic Eyes To heaven, the Saviour; blessing, as He gazed, The food from whence a miracle would rise Magnificent, beyond those dreams of love Celestial, such as sainted Prophets saw. Oh! when His eye immensity o'ercame And travell'd through yon infinite expanse Of worlds on worlds, His own almighty Seat It witness'd! There, pavilion'd round about With clouds and waters, in array'd excess Of unimagined Glory, it beheld Jehovah!—then the mortal bread He brake, And bade Disciples to the awe-struck crowd The food bestow, till that enormous host Were fill'd; and fragments of abundance lay Around them scatter'd from the glorious feast! As though a seed of earth's minutest growth Rose from the ground, and like a forest spread, From that mean food miraculously sprung The glory of a great increase, which grew And multiplied beneath Messiah's hand, Till famish'd thousands were profusely fed. Was ever banquet so sublime as this? No canopy of regal pomp was there, But the bright vastness of unclouded heaven; The turf, a table, and the meanest food A mountain-peasant knows, the sole supply,— But God to serve, a Miracle, the meal! The hour of beauty; Syria's matchless sky Of floating crimson; like Genesareth stretch'd In molten slumber, and her distant flash Of waters gleaming through the forest-boughs, And the deep moral of the mighty scene,— What fancy yearns not, to have witness'd all? But He who fed five thousand, feeds a world And makes all earth miraculous by love! Creation's undiminish'd banquet, spread For ever by the elemental Laws And Seasons ministrant to growth and good, How mindless we by Whose stupendous gift It fosters being as a boundless whole! Enjoyment makes the world's ingratitude; Above, around, beneath, th' almighty Hand Itself avows; at morn, conducting forth The Lord of Brightness; and when day concludes, And dews descend, the fairies of the night, Arraying yonder firmamental arch With moon and planet, and uncounted orbs, Too beautiful for sullied lips to name! But, constant good proves mercy unadored; And while dumb Glories of creation give Their daily witness, Man alone is mute. But night commenceth: hark! a shouting cry, A Multitude's delighted spirit speaks,— And woods are shaken with exulting sound! Like mingling torrents, loud and far ascend Their many voices, blending into one, That hails him Monarch! who had blest the poor.— Then Jesus to Bethsaida bade depart His own Disciples, from the crowd withdrew, And sought his mountain-solitude again. Meanwhile, obedient to a high command, Beloved disciples in their boat embark'd Upon the lake are rocking: Darkness weaves Her veil; and, like a tempest-demon yells The howling wind, and tears the rising sea To billowy madness, o'er whose heave and surge Th' affrighted vessel like a weary bird Advances, hung with flakes of whitest foam. At starless midnight, on the yawning deep The mariners with death and gloom contend, Till in the sound of each remorseless wave Each Heart has heard a funeral anthem howl'd! But ere the redness of reviving dawn Approach'd, when nature wore that spectral hue In which the shadows of the dead arise, A living Shape along the billows stalk'd! God of the Waters, on the waves He moved Sublimely calm! behind Him, like a cloud His garments floated on the gloomy air, And where He trod, the conscious billow sank! At that dim sight each pale Disciple cower'd And trembled, holding in the gasping breath, Yet gazing, till their icy blood congeal'd, Each limb was marble, and the palsied heart Throbb'd loud and quick with supernatural play! A Spectre from the unapparent World He seem'd; or, Spirit of the tempest born, Who walk'd the waters terribly divine! But when in answer to a shriek of dread Heard o'er the billows in its wildest tone, Upon the winds in solemn murmur roll'd “'Tis I!”—the frenzy of affright was calm'd; And he, whose feeling human faith surpass'd, Entreated like a God to tread the deep! “Then come,” the Saviour like a God replied. And he descended; on the deep he walk'd O'erawed by dreadful wonder! wave on wave And wind on wind, in elemental roar Like chaos, how can mortal faith defy? His soul hath doubted, and th' Apostle sinks, Till, “Save me, Lord!” the drowning Peter cries; And him the affable Redeemer caught From out the billows, in their fierce array, Rebuking thus, “O thou of little faith!” His fond disciple: when the toiling bark They both had enter'd, on the waves He look'd,— The Lake was silent, and the Tempest gone! Appalling grandeur! sea and midnight, God And Man, angelic Faith and mortal Fear,— All imaging with allegoric truth A storm of trial on the world's great Sea! Thus, Heaven is round us in the dreadest hour. Her radiant mercies, like the mystic stars Through darkness glitter on the trembling soul: And from that shriek, 'mid whelming billows sent By human frailness, let Presumption learn How Nature falters when she feels secure! Oh! could our actions overtake Resolve, That oft in solitude so highly soars To perfect regions of primeval Good, What noble vengeance would the spirit wreak On baser qualities, which clog the soul! Alas! perfection is our moral dream, And error, nature's true reality: We would be angels, but we must be men! Yet marvel not, that frail delusion hung And hover'd o'er his apostolic mind Who loved the Saviour with impassion'd truth, But oft out-soar'd himself, when feeling dared To mount where Faith alone her flight commands. To him, as all, Messiah's kingdom seem'd Dominion sceptred with terrestrial might; The spell of earth was on them, and they rear'd On words whose meaning look'd this world, beyond Imperial thrones whereon The Twelve would sit Holding the keys of heaven! But Jesus tore That veil of darkness; as rejected Christ By malefactor's death foredoom'd to die, Himself described; and when the shrinking mind Of Peter started with rebellious doubt, How quiver'd it at that august rebuke! “Avaunt thee, Satan! not the Things of God, But those of men, thy blinded heart adores.” And then, at once from out this fading world To heaven, and heaven's unutterable scene Whence throned in glory the Redeemer comes, He led the Conscience, and of Judgment spake,— A shout of Angels! and a trumpet-Voice,— Hark! how it thunders round the shaken earth Till space becomes a universal sound; The graves are riven, and the Sea aghast Unsepulchres her dead! then, all is still, And every eye the Judge of Doom beholds! Ere the dim shadow of this dreaded hour Predicted, from the mind has been dispell'd, His three disciples holy Jesus took From out the plain, to where the balmy hush Of aromatic Tabor breathed. And there While Christ paternal Deity adored, A languor like a cloud of music wrapt The yielding Sense, till wearily o'ercome, Their eyelids closed in slumber's soft eclipse, And slept the mortal three. While such repose Entranced them, into awful glory grew The Form of Jesus! dazzlingly His face That lustrous Mien which Seraphim behold With eyes wing-veil'd, assumed; His raiment shone Like robes that whiten in immortal beams Emitted from the throned Eternal! Bright Beyond imagined brightness, He became Transfigured; God of God, and Light of Light Apparent, round Him earth's surpassing two, In type of law and prophecy fulfill'd By Jesus, Moses and Elias, knelt, Communing; like the roll of thunder-clouds, Their melody of voice the air inspired With deeper magic than expressive sound, That woke the sleepers, whose awe-stricken eyes Reel'd in the blaze as though in heaven unclosed! The Cross, and Resurrection of the Dead Appallingly distinct they heard reveal'd: And Peter, burning with sublime dismay, “Three tabernacles let us rear,” exclaim'd,— “For Thee, for Moses, and Elias, one!” But while he spake, an overshadowing Cloud Descended, such as o'er the golden wings Of Cherubim the Ark's shechinah made; And from its depth a vocal Presence cried, “My Son of Glory! hear His voice! adore!” Like riven trees th' affrighted mortals fell Beneath that sound almighty, till, “Arise,” Messiah utter'd;—they arose, and view'd Nor Cloud, nor Vision, but the lovely green Of Tabor; Jesus in His wonted garb Of meekness; and the soft luxurious sky With azure canopy o'erarching all. The passion that confounded heaven, unthroned Archangels, and the spotless earth defiled, Not Christ himself could overawe! In vain Of agony and blood Messiah spake, To be His direful portion: still prevail'd In each frail mind Ambition's royal dream Of Thrones to come; and whose imperial rank Was most exalted, each with rival hope Disputed. Fathoming their inmost heart, Amid them all the mild Redeemer placed A little child; then, gently with His arm Encompassing that infant, thus began: “Except man be converted, and become As little children, humbled, meek, and pure, My kingdom he cannot partake, nor feel; For childlike is the greatest there!”—How quail'd The pride, how shook the domineering thoughts Of that Assembly, when they thus beheld A passive meekness in the Form august Of Christ embodied; and an artless child The type of man's eternal glory made? Thou happy mother! at whose nursing breast That infant fed; still happier child wert thou, Whose eyelids fell beneath Emmanuel's gaze, Whose brow was hung with innocent alarm, Before that holy Presence!—Fairy Things! Incarnate poetry of human life, Oh, teach us, as around ye lisp and play, Nor heed the clouds, nor hear the muttering wind Which heralds what to-Morrow's doom may be, Like you content in uncomplaining hope To rest resign'd; and innocently wear The smile which universal Love bestows. Pride blasted Eden; and the world has crouch'd Beneath her sceptre, which to break in dust God bow'd the heavens, and every meekness wore. Yet, what are we, that our Titanic dreams Assault the skies with their incessant aim? Oh, could we read Creation's book aright Our nothingness by each vast page would be Convicted! Atoms mock our deepest ken; The winds invisible as angel-wings Attend our path, and tell not whence they come; The Dust derides us! from the floating Orbs Of night's dim world an overwhelming ray Of mystery pierces the distracted mind; And Ocean thunders with resounding scorn When monarchs dare him, and our fleets like foam From wave to wave are darted! Gaze within, And what is there?—a tempest in repose Of passions wild, dark energies, and powers Which storm and madden at the Demon's call! But evil is eternal war with heaven; And Pride, how dauntless! E'en that hallow'd fane Where sacramental Deity is shrined, She enters, balancing with haughty brow The merits which opinion, rank, or sect Assumes, before the Throne of that Supreme From Whose dread gaze the Universe recoils!— When Jesus, from the triple-crested mount Where midnight heard His orison arise, At morn descended, as the rosy flush Of daylight slanted over Kedron's vale And pilgrim-waters, in the Temple throng'd A pharisaic crowd, whose sleepless ire With blood-hound fury track'd His glorious way. Before Him now, as there the people stood And drank His words like inspiration's breath, A poor adulteress they rudely dragg'd For judgment; should He dare condemn Her frailty, Rome would see rebellion rise, And dungeon him for slaughter; should He blot Her guilt, upon His soul her crime devolved! But Christ their black attempt at once unveil'd And answer'd not; and, bending to the ground In mute abstraction, with His finger wrote; Till once again That awful Soul they tried For judgment; then with look divinely-stern He rose, and in a voice of withering tone, “Let him among you who is sinless, cast A stone the first,” the Son of Man replied: Then, Conscience! (Thou that in the deadly night The soul canst wring, and rack the murderer's sleep, Or people solitude with shapes of hell,) The vile accusers Thy terrific power O'erawed; till one by one, as though unseen A Hand compell'd their motion, dumb like Death, And slow, each follow'd each till all were gone! But on the hush of that deserted room A sigh, as though some heart had heaved, and broke, Distinctly fell:—the Saviour's solemn eye Was lifted, and beheld the guilty shape Of woman! on whose burning cheek the blood Confess'd her spirit, and the crime which drew Those tear-drops, running like a liquid fire From agony within. Her downcast head was hung With locks dishevell'd, wild as her despair; Her lips were moveless; but the buried pang Which heaved her bosom with convulsive throes, And frequent shudder of her bending frame, Were language; all which Penitence employ'd To tell the damning shame!—“Hath none condemn'd Thee, woman? Where are thine accusers?” “None,” She answer'd: “Neither then,” the Saviour cried, “Do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more?” The Feast of Lights, when dedicated lamps Flash o'er the walls of Israel's echoing homes, December brings: Jerusalem is loud With chanted song, and melodies from harp And timbrel, dulcimer and tabret pour'd; From towering Altars an unwearied blaze Ascendeth, rolling up with spiral glee And gladness, crimsoning the sultry air. The hearths are heap'd, and silver-headed Age Delightedly to Youth's enamour'd ear The Festival unfolds; while maidens twine The holy Dance, or tune the patriot-lyre To measures, floating like the silky clouds The west along, so meltingly they die! The street-ways, dappled with reflected gleams From many a lattice, like a forest sound When every leaf is motion.—But apart, Beneath yon shadow of the Temple-porch Messiah walk'd, till thence the scowling Jew Compell'd Him, thirsting for His righteous blood, To seek a shelter where Baptising John Had lived, when first by Jordan's laving stream He heralded Redemption. There He taught Believing thousands, till from Mary came A sudden messenger of wo, who said, That Lazarus, whom Messiah loved, was sick. But from that sickness sprang a glorious power The sisters dream'd not! Both did Jesus love; Yet still He rested, till the night of death Advanced, and Lazarus in the tomb reclined. Then slowly went to where in mourning gloom The fond and brotherless with mingled tears His presence waited! Ere the olive-trees Of Bethany o'erhung His meadow'd way, Rush'd Martha forth, to meet her mighty Lord! “Hadst Thou been here, my brother had not died,” Was her sad greeting. “He shall rise again!” Responded Jesus: “When the dead awake And time is ended,” sadly she replied. “I am the Resurrection and the Life! And whoso liveth, and in Me believes, Shall never die!” “The Son of God Thou art The Christ to come, the Everlasting Lord!” In one deep burst of lofty faith she cried, And then withdrew, to where her sister mourn'd,— To Mary, who the better Part preferr'd. At once she rose, the distant meadow sought And prostrate at the feet of Jesus fell; “Hadst Thou been here, my brother had not died” She utter'd; tears alone the rest could tell, And not a lid was dry! Around He gazed, Their tears beheld, their voiceless anguish view'd, Then, meekly bowing His majestic Head, He sigh'd and groan'd in spirit:—Jesus wept! A mournful beauty, a sepulchral grace Doth hallow nature, when the dead are tomb'd In garden-quiet, 'mid the wave of boughs, Which often murmur in our living ears Like tones ancestral by the heart revived. Beneath the twilight of o'erhanging trees A cave was hollow'd, in whose rocky depth Affection to the arms of Earth resign'd Her dead; in mute companionship, there lay The babe and mother, sister, son, and sire, A household, though in dust! A sad delight More exquisite than loud-tongued pleasure feels, Serened the spirit of surviving Love Whene'er it rambled in the pensive gloom Of such a garden. If the summer-air Breathed gladness, heaven was flaked with fleecy clouds, And playsome leaves hung prattling to the wind, While hue and sound made life immortal seem,— A shade of sadness mellow'd, not destroy'd The mirth and beauty of surrounding day. Oft would the eye of some fond mourner rest On the green rock, whose cavern'd silence made The home of Death, where generations slept. And haply, as the wild flowers meekly grew From the dim verdure of sepulchral stone, Delightful thoughts from sad mementos sprung. 'Mid such a scene departed Lazarus lay: And lo! Messiah by the rock-hewn grave Arrived: around him with unspeaking awe Disciples, mourners, and the sisters meek Collect. “The tomb unbar!”—when thus exclaim'd The Lord of Resurrection, from the tomb They roll'd the stone; then Martha's doubting soul Full solemnly He chided! Time had seen Four suns upon her brother's grave reflect Their brightness: on his frame corruption fed E'en now she deem'd, and buried in her doubt That faith whose glory soon its God revcal'd. The stone removed, apart Messiah stood, To heaven uplifted His appealing gaze; Divine communion with the Vast Unseen Awhile He mutely held, and then arose The intonations of His prayer divine. But when a soundless answer from the Throne Descended, more than mortal radiance clothed Each feature! on His brow mysterious calm Was mirror'd; like a Deity he stood, And spake the fiat,—“Lazarus, come forth!” And Lazarus came! as once Creation did From darkness, by His forming Word produced. Bound hand and foot, amid the living breathed The dead, new risen! But his presence cast A terror round it, awe without a name! Entranced, as if another world begun, Dumb with amaze, the whole assembly stood, Till Jesus bade the grave's funereal robes To be unwound, and breathing Lazarus spake. As though a tree by blasting time destroy'd Bloom'd into life, and suddenly display'd The perfect glory of its forest-prime, So did the freshness of reviving blood At once the lividness of death dispel; And Lazarus, pure as Man's primeval form Appear'd when first creation call'd him, Lord. Such power immense, in open day reveal'd, Through town and village, plain and hamlet woke A grateful wonder. At the school of Seers The sage consulted; street and dwelling heard One mingled clamour of admiring tongues; And in the Synagogues a muttering crowd Would linger, to peruse each other's face, And chronicle, as Rumour told its tale, The words of age, or wisdom. But the blaze Miraculous, which round the risen dead Concentred, fell like pestilential fire Upon the soul of that dark Sect, whose reign Was clouded, and whose mouldering sceptre shook. Their fancy gloated on His bleeding form; Their dreams were haunted with His dying pangs, And every heart some malediction framed To mock His agony! Amid the wilds Of Ephraim, hence the Lord of grace withdrew, Till came the moment for the final Scene Of Man's redemption, to unroll its gloom: Amid the Capital with dreadless foot Then march'd He forth to meet that blood-red Hour! To Jericho, along whose plain immense In greenest lustre rose unnumber'd palms That waved their beauty on balsamic winds, Amid the breath of roses, flush'd and bright As clouds of damask when they drink the hues Of sunset, Jesus and disciples went. But soon from out her walls, and stately crowd Of palaces, and domes of marble sheen, He passed to Bethany, where Lazarus rose, And shouting hosts with palms had come to meet The Son of David. From the verdant top Of Olivet, to where a hamlet smiled Before them, bosom'd in a mountain-vale, The two Disciples, at the word divine, Departed. There, as Christ's prophetic eye Fore-shadow'd, at the village-gate they found A colt, which never mortal burden bore, Then led it to the Lord; devoutly hung Their garments o'er its sacred back, and placed The Christ thereon. Thus Zechariah sang, When Centuries, in their darkest slumber bound, To him like animated Creatures rose, And utter'd visions!—Wonderful Thy ways, Jehovah! in the whirlwind, Thou art there! The tempest is Thy language; sea, Thy path; And Glory, but the shadow of Thy shade! Yet human actions, by completing words Which drew aside the veil of Time, and roll'd Their meaning down the depth of Years unborn, With voice as mighty as creation speaks, Thy power attest, Thy ruling hand portray. But oh! what jubilant hosannahs rose As Him they sung, magnificent, and great, And good, and glorious, Israel's promised King, The Prince of Peace! Beneath His path their robes They strew'd, and round Him waved triumphant palms, And scatter'd branches; while a choral shout Deeper and deeper like colossal waves Of sound ascended! till the Air partook The rapture, and the sympathetic leaves As with a breezy joy of summer-noon Were shaken! Then a sudden silence came On the loud Host; as when the pausing storm In elemental muteness dies away, The clamour ceased; a multitude was dumb. On vast Jerusalem's devoted towers The gaze of Christ prophetically fell, And tears from out His mournful spirit rose While He beheld them, and their doom pronounced: “If Thou hadst known, at least in this Thy day,— But peace hath vanish'd ever from Thine eyes! Thine hour is coming; round Thee shall a trench Be cast, and compass Thee on every side, Till tomb'd in dust Thy towers and children fall, Nor leave a stone to tell where Thou hast been! Jerusalem! Jerusalem! whose hand Hath stoned the prophets, and the holy slain, How often, as the hen beneath her wings Her brood protecteth, would My shielding hand Have shelter'd Thee!—Thy children would not come! Thine House is desolate, thy Kingdom gone, And never till the clouds of Judgment waft His Glory, will thine eyes again behold The Son of Man. But magnify, O God, My Father! magnify Thine awful Name:” The heavens grew vocal, and an angel-voice Came forth,—“I have, and will,” whose thunder spake. Thus saying, in the portico He sat, Where ever and anon, within a chest Beside the pillars chain'd, an offering fell From worshippers. Amid the pompous crowd Of rich adorers, came a humble form, A widow, meek as Poverty doth make Her children; with a look of sad content Her mite within the treasure-heap she cast: Then, timidly as bashful twilight stole From out the Temple. But her lowly gift Was witness'd by an Eye, whose mercy views In motive all which consecrates a deed To goodness: so He bless'd the widow's mite, Beyond the gifts abounding Wealth bestow'd. Thus is it, Lord! with Thee: the heart is Thine, And all the world of hidden action there Works in Thy sight like waves beneath the sun Conspicuous; and a thousand nameless acts That lurk in lovely secrecy, and die Unnoticed like the trodden flowers which fall Beneath a proud man's foot, to Thee are known, And written with a sunbeam in that Book Of Life, where mercy fills the brightest page. Front of the Temple, whose enormous wall Outlived the fury of Chaldèan fires, And while around chaotic ruins fell Stood, like a master-spirit when the world Is rocking,—Olivet's green summit rose: And there Messiah, with his few elect, Ascended; thence He took a last farewell! Beneath them, in a wilderness of homes, The thousand-streeted City lay, and roll'd The hum and murmur of her myriad sounds High in the air; while far around her stood The guardian-mountains, bathed in ruddy hues Of sunlight, while the peaks of countless spires Flash'd from the midst like pinnacles of flame. But, lone in glory, pillar'd, proud, and huge, Colossal as some architectural dream Embodied, Israel's massy Temple blazed; And seem'd, in her immensity of shape, A Shrine that would endure eternally! When each disciple had around him gazed, And feasted with magnificent delight On such a miracle of pomp and scene, “It all shall wither! not a stone endure” Messiah cried; and, like a dying knell That murmur sank upon their listening souls! That dread prediction! was it not fulfill'd Beyond Imagination's blackest dream Of horror, when the hell of earth began, And men were Demons with a robe of flesh Enveloped, banqueting on human blood? Ere forty years had swept the scene of time, On that same Mount where spake the awful Seer And drew from darkness the almighty Curse To come, the fierce-eyed Romans had encamp'd Their Legions; while the roll of martial drums, And a loud music from the brazen lips Of trump and clarion, with a sound of death Frighted the hills and dales of Palestine. Distress of nations! Sun and Moon withdrawn Enshrouded, that their gaze might not behold The World's disaster. From the howling sea Hark to the tempest! on the earth are crime And famine, fear and pestilence combined; While Havoc, on the wings of fury borne, Scatters fell ruin like a burning wind Which hurries round the universal orb To wither up creation! Far and near, Whatever Light can face, or Darkness feel, Is terrible: and list! amid the gloom Of midnight, like a guilty creature shakes A giant-City, as the earthquake-pant With fitful heavings moves her mighty heart! Jehovah is abroad! the heavens appall'd, Forget their seasons; cloud-like visions, fill'd With fiery battle, and a myriad Shapes Of warriors charioted by burning steeds That vanish in commotion, throng the air With omens! Then, a starry Weapon cleaves The sky, and flashes with descending might As though 'twere wielded by Eternal Hands! While day and night, Jerusalem's ghastly eye Looks up, and sees a blood-red Comet blaze, Fix'd like a Curse of fire above the scene To agonise whate'er its flashes meet! And once at midnight, with appalling burst The massive portals of God's inner Shrine Expanded, and the shuddering Fabric heard A Voice that issued with a dread farewell, Whose thunder was departing Deity! The hour of Judgment! lo, at length it comes, And God is in it with devouring wrath That deepens, till the stricken Earth despairs. The Queen of Zion, beautiful and vast, Glory of nations! who shall paint thee now? Enwrapp'd with horrors, famish'd, weeping, faint, And fallen, round thee like a circling flood Rears a huge wall of Babylonian height, And thou a captive in the centre art For martyrdom. But, hark! in whirlwind-rush A roaring flame around the Temple sweeps! Moriah like a seething furnace glows And reddens; as a cloudy palace built By sunset, there it dwindles, melts, and dies,— The fabric of Jehovah! Palsied, wild, and pale, In solemn agony hush'd myriads stand, Scorch as they gaze, but still yon gorgeous wreck Beholding, on their ghastly features plays A light of ruin, ere the Temple falls, Like funeral glory! then, in tombs of fire, While the last pillar of expiring flame Mounts o'er yon wreck, they shriek, despair, and die! BOOK VI. “But who is He with tortured brow, Degraded, bleeding, dying, now; His Visage marr'd beyond despair? Thou quaking earth! thy God is there! The Sun appall'd hath slunk away, And darkness hides the guilty Day; Avert, O World! thine impious eyes; The curse is o'er,—but Jesus dies!” —MS. ANALYSIS OF BOOK VI. The Book commences with an apostrophe connected with the sad and mighty events which the conclusion of the Saviour's Life unrolls; but, previous to detailing them, a retrospective view of His Character, Actions, and Doctrine, is attempted; the order of time is then preserved to the Ascension—The Sanhedrim take council against Christ — Judas agrees to betray Him—The Last Supper—Description of the same—Terror and sadness of the Disciples when Christ announced that He was about to be betrayed—The Rite of Sacrament founded—The Redeemer's Farewell—The Garden of Gethsemane —Jesus in His Agony—Is traduced—The Dawn of the Day of Crucifixion—Jesus brought up for trial— Peter's Denial—Reflections on his Faith and Weakness—Jesus is condemned—Led to Caiaphas—Pronounced guiltless—Pilate makes his final attempt to acquit the Redeemer—Barabbas preferred to Jesus—At last is led forth on the judgment-seat in sight of the multitude—The repentance, horror, and destruction of Iscariot—The Crucifixion and its attendant scenes—The Miracles which attested His Godhead at His Death—The Burial of Christ— Night Scene—Moonlight on the Tomb of Jesus— The Roman watch, &amp;c. &amp;c.—The Resurrection— Affright of the Soldiers—Vision of the Angels— Jesus reveals Himself to Mary—Journey of the two Disciples to Emmaus—Appearance of Christ—Discovered by the breaking of Bread—His Second Appearance to the Eleven—Miraculous Draught of Fishes—Peter thrice questioned—Previous to His Ascension, Christ takes the Eleven with Him to a Mountain—Explains the Scriptures, gives His Final Charge, and ascends to Heaven. Here, as far as the Life of the Messiah is included, the Poem ends; but the Second Advent is the Hope, Faith, and Glory of a Christian, and could not be omitted. Previously to this, however, some reflections on the subject of the Poem, state of the human mind, the destinies of man, and the spirit of Poetry, viewed in connection with the advancement of Christianity, are offered: these naturally conclude in a contemplation of the immortality which was brought to light through the Redeemer —His Second Advent—Resurrection of the Dead— Last Judgment of Men and Angels—Conclusion. Prepare, O Earth! with solemn gloom invest Thy glories; bid the rayless Sun retire, The Sky be sad, the Winds be tongues of wo, And deep-toned litanies from Ocean swell: Let time and nature, scene and conscious man In one vast fellowship of grief unite;— An hour is coming, charged with dreadful fate, Whose darkness palls a Saviour's agony! But, ere the crisis of creation dawn And palsied Earth her bleeding God proclaims, Behold the beauty of His matchless life In deed and thought connecting earth with heaven! Cull every virtue which the Mind conceives, Or view Perfection's archetypal Form And what can emulate the Prince of Peace? Where once the Seasons, in luxuriant strife, Reign'd on the shore of that immortal Lake Whose wave is purple as the heaven it loves, In that blest clime where fruit and verdure bathed Their tinted beauty in the richest sun, Where all is dreary now—Messiah dwelt, And bodied forth God's everlasting Will In life and love, by Incarnation there. Born in a manger,—yet by guardians bright And wing'd adorers, heralded and hymn'd; The Heir of all things—yet possessing none; Surrender'd now to tears of mortal truth, Or ministrant at some disciple's feet, Then,—thunder-greeted by the glorious Sky! Here from the flower a lovely doctrine flows, And now,—a Tempest from His frown recoils; Hung on the cross, a malefactor's doom He suffer'd,—yet a paradise was there By Him accorded to the felon-soul! Though bleeding clay,—incarnate God confess'd Whose pangs an aching Universe partook; While from those agonies which man beheld And mock'd the terror-blighted Sun withdrew! Man never spake, in words divinely-toned With tenderness beyond a tear to move, Like Him, to Whom unutter'd feelings lay Free as the clouds before a sun, exposed. The Heart,—He knew it best, and proved it most, And touch'd the master-chords of human mind. And oh! what exquisite discernment mark'd Each high discourse, to creed or sect applied. Some true analogy in scenes, or sounds, And palpably by outward sense perceived, From mead and plough, the summer-task or toil, From storm and season, fruit and flower,—enlived Each sacred lesson which Emmanuel taught. And when hath Poet from his airy world To shape or action summon'd such express And touching images of graceful power, As Parables, where conscience is instinctive judge And to the mind celestial truth commends? Pathetic loveliness in all abounds; And as the eloquent Creation oft By moonlight more than storm the soul subdues, When language by severest wrath sustain'd, No passion quell'd, the parable prevail'd; Whose soft dominion, like an angel-smile Moved o'er the heart, and seemed reflected there. A Being thus surpassingly endow'd, Whose life was goodness in perpetual act; By pure magnificence of spirit raised Above whate'er Platonic vision shaped Of high and holy, in the perfect Man, What hymnèd worship should all Earth have paid To such embodied Glory! Yet a doom Of torture hover'd o'er His righteous Head: The Sinless for the sinful World must die! E'en now, the plotting Sanhedrim convened; When suddenly, disorder'd, pale, and rack'd With guilty terror, which on brow and cheek Imprinted, villain! lo, the traitor comes, And thirty pieces for his Lord betray'd Demandeth: then with unappall'd delight The Priesthood revels o'er His dying form! There, as the traitor in the twilight-gloom Is homeward skulking with a stealthy pace While every breeze like condemnation sounds, By Nature mutter'd with mysterious scorn, A Spirit, dark as demons love, behold! He, ever when the proffer'd crown approach'd The head of Christ, in worldly vision hail'd The sceptred honours of some high domain About to dawn: but when the Saviour's lip Blest the meek hands which typically pour'd Balsamic odours to anoint His head, Rebuke was felt, and disappointment raged; Till Satan enter'd with a rush of guilt The soul of Judas, and the traitor rose A dark apostate in his dream of blood! Meanwhile Messiah, whose omniscient word A room appointed for the paschal Feast, To eat the Lamb of covenant prepared. His pangs approach, His agonies begin To throng around Him! and that hour, foretold, Prefigured, and so oft in gloom unveil'd To His mistaken Twelve, is come at last The Man of Wo to meet! A feast is set Of wine and water, as Mosaic law Ordain'd; where each with due thanksgiving drinks The Cup whose seal and sanction typified The Blood of Jesus, by symbolic power; And then, the taintless Lamb, the ritual Herb, And Bread unleaven'd, psalm and prayer succeed, Each serving each with ceremonious awe. But in the midst, again rebellious pride, Like Satan when he darken'd Paradise By curst intrusion, mars the lovely scene And mournful beauty of our Lord's farewell. But, princes, thrones, and dominations bow, Lie mute and dead, ye arrogant desires! Ambition! dooming life one long despair, Quench the wild fever of thy fire-struck brain, Heaven stoops to earth, a Deity to dust, A God is kneeling at the foot of Man!— Humility which makes the heart to reel, Our blood to quiver, and the brow of pride Prostrates beneath the scathing light of shame! Oh, when was meekness so almighty found, As when the Saviour dwarfs degree and state And dims the splendour of all outward things, Till, like the radiance of a dying eve, The waning glories of the World depart! But why hath sadness with a sudden gloom On each descended? What hath blanch'd the cheek With terror, in the eye dejection pour'd, And stirr'd the calm of countenance with lines Of feeling, working into restless play Like breeze-moved water? Eye to eye, and brow To brow, in horrible dismay upturn'd, Each reads the other with unspoken dread Of something buried in the soul's abyss, Which now must be untomb'd, and stand condemn'd In the full light of God's omniscient gaze! And yet, though terror-struck, with sad exclaim Each utters, “Is it I?” Eleven are pure; Their souls are ramparted with sacred truth, They tremble deeply, but with guiltless fear. And one there was, o'er all the rest beloved; Whose tender mildness and devoted faith With childlike fervour to the Lord endear'd A guileless nature,—him whom “Jesus loved,” The meek St. John! Beyond expressive wo, The tearful language of his eye reveal'd A yearning spirit; while his drooping head Lay fondly pillow'd on the breast of Christ. By Peter urged, with look of saddest depth On Christ he gazed, and whisperingly ask'd, “Who is it, Lord?” Then Jesus, “He who takes The bread I give, the Son of Man betrays: But, wo the traitor! well for him, had light And being never an Iscariot known!” Betrayer! thou whose spirit coil'd and sunk Within thee, as a serpent when the day Shines on the darkness of his den retires To deeper gloom! upon thy face appears A pale confession, which thy tongue denies: Yes! thou art he,—a traitor to thy Lord! And driven by the whirlwind of despair, Forth from the chamber of discover'd guilt Thou speedest; darkness is a heaven to thee; And thou hast night, sepulchrally array'd, And starless, fit to cloak a traitor's deed Or give to earth the gloominess of hell! As the dim spell-work of some awful dream Can people slumber with a ghastly host Of shapes and sounds, till lo! the morning-smile Dissolves it, so hath this phantasmal scene Of doubt and dread, of agonising sway, At once receded; and quiescent joy Again upon the true disciples came, When Judas from the paschal-chamber went, Convicted traitor! Then, with mien august, The mild Redeemer took the Bread, and blest And brake it; and the cup of Wine He took, And then of both made each disciple take:— A holy Sacrament, whose typic shade The great Passover was; but mightier far The rite of Jesus, whose remembrance speaks No single nation, but a boundless World Deliver'd, saved, and free! As bread and wine The body nourish, so the soul is fed By faith in this symbolic meal of Love, Wherein is shadow'd the Redeemer's death. “Do This, and thou wilt then remember Me!” Remember Thee! the Way, the Truth, and Life, On Whose pure eyelids hung our mortal tears; Who wert so inaccessibly supreme In the bright plenitude of awe and power, And yet, so veil'd by condescending love That Childhood gazed upon Thy glorious smile, And deem'd it heavenlier than mothers wear; Refuge and Rest 'mid all the woes of time! Almighty Anchor for a sin-toss'd world! Incarnate Saviour, and co-equal God, Remember Thee!—oh, if some dying words Of honour'd parent round the memory cling With aye unweaken'd charm, shall man forget That dear and solemn, Thy divine command Beyond all parents'? Till Thy Kingdom come When the great Banquet of perpetual bliss With Thee in glory Thine elected sons Partake, O Saviour! be this Sacrifice And Sacrament with awful love revered: For in it pardon and preserving grace Abound, and by it Earth with Heaven communes; And when o'erwearied by this anxious world, Or toss'd in the tempestuous gloom of sin The soul repenteth, yet in doubt appears Like Hagar in the wilderness, to weep and die Forsaken, there in this all-heavenly Feast Redeemer! Thine incarnate Presence dwells: And gently as the arkless dove was ta'en Back to a shelter from the dreary wild Of waters, welcomed by a meeting smile, The soul is bosom'd on Thy holy rest. But listen! for the Lord's farewell begins, And deeply-solemn, His mysterious tones Fall on the silence of the sacred room, Till tears have gather'd in their gazing eyes From whence He parteth, to ascend and reign Where man beholds not. Yet, in dreadless faith, The fervent Peter, with erected brow And voice triumphant over hell, replied, “Though all desert Thee, still will Peter stand A rock unshaken! death nor dungeon frights His spirit; life itself but lives in Thee!” “I tell thee, Peter, ere the cock shall crow This very night wilt thou deny Me thrice!” Then, more impassion'd with a louder voice And lip that quiver'd with exulting throb, “Deny Thee! unto death my soul is fix'd!” The fond one answer'd, and on Jesus gazed With mild reproach, like one who feels his wrong, But pleaded only by a look which spake! A sadness, deep and holy as the heart E'er felt, came o'er that mute assembly now, When the meek Saviour with angelic truth Began: “Believe in God, in Me believe, For in My Father's everlasting House Are many Mansions, and your Lord departs, That ye may follow to a place prepared. The Comforter, the Holy Ghost, shall come, And all I utter'd, memory shall teach, By Him instructed; peace, immortal Peace! Beyond the world to give, with you I leave: Abide in Me, as branches in the Vine Endure, and ye shall bear celestial Fruit!” And then, as o'er Him, in its dark array A vision of their sad desertion swept, Messiah added, “Do ye now believe? Behold! it cometh, yea, the hour is come! When all are scatter'd, and the Son of Man Is left,—yet not alone, for God is there: The world is trouble, but in Me a peace Unfading; let your souls in that confide Nor tremble; I have overcome the World!” Then, lifting his omniscient eyes to Heaven, “My Father, glorify Thy Son!” He cried; “Thy work is finish'd, and Thy faith is taught, And Light and Immortality declared; And now The Glory, Mine before this earth Was founded, I ascend with Thee to share!” Thus ended, Lord! thy first and last farewell. When rose the parting hymn Devotion sang, And all o'er Kedron to the Olive Mount Departing, wait upon Thy steps divine. But, veil thyself, Imagination! veil And worship; put thy shoes from off thy feet, Thou mortal Gazer! for on hallow'd ground More consecrate than he of Horeb saw When the bush burn'd with sacramental fire, Thou tread'st,—the garden of Gethsemane! The Moon, pale hermitress of heaven, hath found With no bright fellowship of starry orb Her midway-sphere; and now with conscious dread Shrined in a cloudy haze, she disappears, While motionless yon patriarchal trees Of towering olive lift their spectral gloom. But listen! groan on groan, with awful swell Heaves on the air, as though a God bewail'd His creatures!—Christ in agony is bow'd, And prostrate; while from each denuded pore A litany of Blood to Heaven appeals! Convulsed within Him, hark, the Human cries, “My Father! if it can be, let this Cup Be taken from Me, from this hour removed: And yet not Mine, but let Thy Will, be done!” Dark agonies, ineffable as deep That moment knew, whose merit countervail'd All which Eternity's remorse could pay, Wrung from the torment of a punish'd World! As once on Tabor His transfigured Form A shadow of celestial Glory threw On Man's perception, so in this doom'd hour Gethsemane's most awful Scene declares The dreadful Infinite of sin, and guilt. His Manhood suffer'd all that Flesh could feel:— God unappeased, and Satan unsubdued, Darkness, and death, and unrepented crimes Still brooding o'er the world, and He foredoom'd Upon the Cross of agony to die That Heaven might open on forgiven man,— These were combined in one almighty pang! Exceeding sorrowful His soul became E'en unto death; till from the Throne His cry Of anguish brought a soothing Angel down. But in the passion of this fateful hour, Oh! where are they, whose eyes so oft beheld His wonders, in whose hearts His voice had pour'd The balm and blessing of immortal Truth? Alas! one hour they could not watch, nor pray; And they were sleeping, when the Saviour thrice From prayer arose, and thrice their sleep forgave! Yet now sleep on; and take unthinking rest; The Son of Man, Emmanuel is betray'd, The traitor hath his treason-work fulfill'd! For, hear ye not the sound of rushing feet And ruder voices, through the moonless air Advancing? Stirr'd, as by a tempest-wing, Around the olive-branches creak and bend, And light comes flashing with a fierce intent, Till on the countenance of Christ it falls And lights His features: marr'd and pale they shone Beneath it, as He met a midnight-band With torch and lantern, sword and stave empower'd Their impious hands on His pure Form to lay. When “I am He!” was spoken, back they fell Like life before a sudden blast of death By miracle emitted!—“I am He” Again was utter'd, and again they fell Confounded, till the traitor with a kiss Betoken'd Jesus; then the troop approach'd And bound Him. Legions! from your thrones of Light Descend, and wither that unhallow'd throng! No: meekly as a lamb to slaughter goes The Lord hath yielded; fetter'd, silent, sad, Deserted, and betray'd, alone He meets The Powers of darkness in their deepest might. The break of morning with a dim uprise! Pale as a Prophet, when his eye foresees Unutter'd woes upon the future throng, The Sun awaketh from his cloudy sleep To usher in this all-tremendous Day. Already in yon judgment-chamber meet The fell accusers; there, aloft upraised, Their holy Victim in the upper-hall His trial waiteth:—not a shade of fear The innocence of that calm Brow defiles! In shape a Man, in dignity a God He seemeth. But around the palace-fire Beneath Him, from the council-seat apart, What curses, loud with wrathful meaning, roll? A damsel, when the Galilean-voice Of Peter sounded with betrayful tones, His true discipleship at once declared Then, he who hail'd Him “Son of living God!” Adored His Person, saw His glory shine, And vow'd eternally with changeless love Through life and death unswerving faith to hold, The sacred knowledge of his Lord denied! But when with horrid malediction rang The fierce denial of his furious lip, Till his eye glitter'd with a ghastly fire, And falsehood, cowardice, and guilty fear All met and mingled with terrific clash Within, a second time the Cock then crew! And Jesus,—who shall paint the glance He gave, Where pity, pardon, and subdued reproach Concenter'd in such look of loving power That Peter shrank, and trembled into tears! Impassion'd, bold, beyond thy strength sincere, Sublime apostle but a sinful man, As in thy faith, so in thy fall we find, A truth which bids the yearning bosom feel, E'en as thou wert, how half the world has been! Forgiven mourner! while with mantled face In groaning penitence without the porch Thou weepest, and from unforgotten scenes A radiant vision of the Past returns With blighting splendour to condemn thy soul, Thou art a Moral for mankind to read And heart to study, long as Earth remains! While thus in penance sad St. Peter wept, Amid a council of encircling priests And scribes and elders, lone Emmanuel stood For judgment. Witness after witness rose, Suborn'd and savage; yet a war of words Where lie to lie and truth to truth opposed A meaning, all their accusation grew; But when His doctrine the Archpriest assail'd; “The temple, synagogue, the open world, Let these My doctrine testify, and tell, For nought in secret have I said or done!” Thus answer'd the Redeemer; then uprose Accusers, who with dreadless voice declared “The gorgeous Fabric which our eyes adore, He thus blasphemed; ‘This temple built with hands, Will I destroy; in three days shall arise Another, built by no terrestrial hands!’” Majestic silence was the sole reply. Then Caiaphas, with fierce emotion shook And darken'd; from his council-throne up sprang And with a voice like far-off thunder cried, “Now by the living and tremendous God Thee I adjure! art Thou The Christ?”—“I am! Hereafter, coming with the clouds of heaven Girt like Jehovah, see the Son of Man!” Then, “Let Him die!” throughout th' assembly rung. The morning comes; and with unfolding day The tragedy a deeper die assumes. Again did Pilate, with proclaiming voice To elder, priest, and multitude pronounce The Saviour guiltless: “Let Him be released!” In vain he cried; for hark the savage yell, “A prisoner! be our wonted right perform'd, A captive freed!” 'Twas in that stormy hour The dark confession of a hideous dream The wife of Pilate in her slumber saw, Was then reported: but His hour had come! “Barabbas!” was the universal shout By thousands echoed, when their judge preferr'd To free Messiah, “Let Barabbas loose!” But “Christ, what deadly evil hath he done?” Again did “Crucify!” in one fell war Rise on the air so murderous and loud, That Pilate quiver'd on his judgment-throne. Then Jesus, by the soldiers dragg'd, endured The mockery of reed, and robe, and crown Of platted thorns, upon His temples press'd; There as He bled, before Him bow the knees Of scoffing worshippers, who shout and hail “King of the Jews!” then smite His awful head And crush the crown upon His aching brows! Thus bleeding, marr'd and mock'd, the Saviour comes: Unmoved He stands, insuperably calm. But wilder grew the clamour; hand, and eye, And voice were raging with terrific signs Of vengeance; till the name of “Cæsar” rang Loud on the soul of Pilate, like the knell Of his destruction! Cæsar's foe must die; And Hate shall crucify whom Justice spared. Then took he water, laved his hands, and cried, “That I am innocent of blood, behold, Of this just Person; be it yours to bear.” “His blood be on us! on our children be!” In mingled answer from that murderous crowd Ascended; dreary as the dying swell Of ocean, up to heaven this awful breath Of imprecation roll'd, and drew from God The answer, Judah's myriads suffer now! Earth never parallel'd a scene like this, When list'ning Worlds were overawed to hear A creature his incarnate God condemn! A paved tribunal by the Palace rose Of pictured marble, and mosaic sheen, Whereon was Pilate as in kingly state Enthroned; before him stood a bleeding Form Of solemn aspect, in Whose mild regret A sanctitude beyond expression spake. Below a raving multitude was seen Upgazing, all athirst for righteous blood; And who, with features harrow'd by the strife And scorn of passion, from their God invoked Eternal vengeance for eternal Blood! But where the vile traducer? While the doom Of death was pass'd, and Jesus like a Lamb To slaughter by the savage crowd decreed, Then, Conscience, thy tremendous power began! The beauty, glory, and sublime display Of virtues godlike by the sinless Christ Embodied, back upon his memory came; And in the light of that immaculate Lord From all He did reflected, dark and deep The perfidy of His betrayer frown'd! Lash'd by remorse, the council-Chief he sought, The crime of Innocence by him betray'd Confess'd; but when in vain his pleading guilt Repented, in the Temple down he hurl'd The wages of Iniquity, and fled On wings of horror!—like a maniac, wild And blasted into solitude he ran. The ground grew fire beneath his guilty tread; The heavens hung o'er him like a vast reproach; And groans which make the jubilee of hell Heaved from his soul with terrible excess! Where rose a precipice, whose rocky gloom The plunging billows of a torrent fill'd With mimic thunder in chaotic roar, At length he stood, and on the black abyss Stared wildly—then a pace withdrew, Look'd o'er the heavens his horrible despair! Till Nature with a ghastly dimness seem'd Enshrouded; round him the horizon reel'd, The earth was waning, and with hideous yell He seized the branches of a rock-grown tree, Swung from its height, and down the dizzy steep Sunk into darkness, and was seen no more! But come, thou Spirit of believing Awe Whom nothing boundeth, and a scene behold More wond'rous than eternity conceals,— A crucified Redeemer! With His cross To Calvary the lacerated Christ Is now ascending; famish'd, faint, and pale, Beneath the burden of a tree accursed He falters; yet the goading throng His limbs profane, and trample when He falls Their silent Martyr! Lest at once He die And cheat the tortures of intended doom, To bear it, from Cyrene is compell'd A pilgrim; and again with murd'rous glee The rabble round about Him dance and hoot. Thus, all are merciless, while Mercy bleeds, Save thou, fond Woman! in thy faithful eyes Are tears; and from thine unforsaking love The language of sublimest pity flows. Yet not for Him, but for yourselves lament; Ye daughters of Jerusalem! who wail; The days are coming when the soul will cry “The wombs how blessèd which have never borne!” But lo; the hill of Golgotha appears; The Cross is planted; with convulsive shake Each limb unloosen'd; and the starting blood In liquid torment from the flesh distill'd; In vain, a potion to benumb His pangs Is proffer'd; dying God, He suffers all. “Forgive them; for they know not what they do!” And thus they crucify the Son of Man! Those Hands are bleeding, which have bless'd a world; Those Feet are tortured, which have never moved Except on errands of celestial Love; Those Brows are throbbing, and those Eyes bedimm'd Where light and immortality were throned; And ah! that pure, unspotted, perfect Soul, Divine as Deity on earth could be, Doth agonise beneath th' imputed Curse Whereby a ransom for the World is paid: And silently He all endures! Around His Cross The soldiers wrangle for the parted vest; And when His eye in lifted torment gazed O'er Calvary, by crowding myriads trod, How few the faces where compassion dwelt, Or tears were trickling, did that look behold! The scowl of Pharisees, the hate of Scribes, And the fierce glance of hypocrites rebuked, Were turn'd upon Him, to translate His pangs, And drink the fulness of a deep revenge! While others underneath the Cross advanced To read His title with reviling scorn, “King of the Jews!” Two thieves beside Him hung In kindred torture to increase the shame. The one did rail, the other's soften'd heart Repented; sudden faith his soul illumed, And, “Lord! when in Thy kingdom Thou art throned Remember me!” the dying creature said; And lo! a paradise was his reward. Then look'd Messiah where His mother stood, The Virgin Mary, with His Own beloved Disciple; agony could not subdue His tenderness; compassion fill'd His gaze With heavenly lustre, while in filial love He bent on Mary the divinest look That ever Child on weeping parent cast, And murmur'd, “Woman! there a Son behold; Disciple! there a future Mother see.” O Maiden! purest of all pure, who felt A love maternal, when thy bosom throbb'd Beneath the pangs of thine almighty Son, The sword of anguish, then thy soul it pierced, As hoary Simeon in the Temple sang. Thus in the light, 'tween heaven and earth upraised, Upon the malefactor's cross was nail'd, Was crucified, the Lord of living Worlds! Till came the sixth hour, when the noontide-sun Waned from his throne; and sudden darkness fell O'er all Judea, till creation seem'd By God forsaken, Whose averted face Bade darkness emblematically type The gloom internal God in Flesh endured. Jerusalem, her temples, domes, and towers, Were shaded; Lebanon and Tabor shrunk And wither'd; Carmel, Gilead, and the rocks By ocean towering, shadow cover'd all With night's terrific semblance. In the gloom The mutter of a multitude uprose Like sounds infernal; while their features wore A fell expression of unearthly hue,— Each fearing what his impious tongue denied, As ever and anon some coward took A shuddering glance, where Man's Redeemer hung, While the blood quiver'd in his guilty veins Till blasphemy in hollow murmur died! Heart cannot dream, imagination dare By words to image th' almighty pangs That in His darkness and distress of soul Th' Ineffable upon the Cross endured! Who held His spirit as the Prince of Life, To torment subject, till the Curse was paid. The ninth hour came; and then, with loud appeal, From the deep midnight of atoning Blood, He utter'd, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me! My God! My God!”—then came an awful hush In which they deem'd Elias would descend To save Him: but, a second time, a Voice More audible the souls of myriads shook: “'Tis finish'd! Father, to Thy hands divine My Spirit I commend,” the Saviour cried, And bow'd His head, and breathed His soul away! “'Tis finish'd!” let seraphic mind these words Translate, for immortality is there! Which heaven re-echoed, while the regions dark Where Christ descended in a shape of Light Triumphant over Powers and Thrones of Hell, Groan'd at the sound which deepen'd their despair! The Universe a ghastly signal gave, And Nature, as in agony, confess'd The Lord of Glory as His Spirit fled. The earth was palsied; and the mountains rent Like garments; tomb and sepulchre their dead Released, and out of dust the saints arose And look'd upon the living; while the Veil, As 'mid the Temple of the Holies stood A robed High Priest, in sacerdotal pomp, Was riven, from the top to bottom torn; And full at once the Oracle reveal'd. Now, in the tremor of created things While rock and earthquake, tomb and temple, speak With dread conviction, “'tis a God that dies!” The pale centurion and the crowd aghast Lift their wild looks, and smite their breasts, and cry, With lips that shudder, “'Tis the Son of God!” A Tragedy which made the sun eclipse His beams, and sympathising Earth to cast Her waken'd dead from out their riven tombs, Is ended! and the oriental Night O'er Palestine her dewy wings unfolds. On Calvary the solemn moonbeams lie All chill and lovely, like those trancèd smiles Which light the features, when the pangs of death Have ceased to flutter, and the face is still. The stars are trooping; and the wintry air Is mellow'd with a soft mysterious glow Caught from their beauty; not a vapour mars The stainless welkin, where the moon aloft One blue immensity of sky commands, Save where the fringe of some minutest cloud Hangs like an eyelid on a brilliant Orb, Then vanishes, in quenching lustre hid. Few hours have fleeted, and yon trampled hill Was shaken with a multitude, who foam'd And raged beneath their agonising God! But Nature hath her calm resumed; and night, As if to spread oblivion o'er the day And give creation a sabbatic rest, In balm and beauty on the world descends. The crowds have disappear'd like waves that melt And leave a shore to quietude again: Some in their dreams, perchance, the day renew; But thou! upon a kingly couch reposed, The Judge of Jesus, could thy soul conceive That long as Time's recorded truths endure Thy name, united to this awful scene, Would live, when all the Cæsars are forgot? The hum and murmur of a distant town How faintly on the breeze they roll, and die In soft confusion! Turn thy gaze, and see, Encircled with a huge Titanian wall, Where tower and turret, and Herodian piles, And battlements of dusky gloom uprear Their vastness, there the Holy City stands! Augustly beautiful, in moonlight bathed, Jehovah's palace awes the midnight-air Around it; while her mountain-bulwarks veil'd With dimmer lustre, far and near preside Like guardians planted by almighty hands, To watch the city, where a million breathe. From plain and desert, isles and regions call'd, Wherever son of Abram was, they throng For worship, and their Paschal Feast enjoy. And there, in some unnoticed chamber lurk The panic-struck apostles! When the gloom Of earthquake on the hill of Calvary hung, That God was coming from the Cross to take Messiah, or, that Christ Himself would free And shake the universe to show the God,— Ambition blindly dreamt. As Lord of Worlds Him they conceived too wonderful to die! A veil was on them; though the truthful Lord His future resurrection oft declared, 'Twas unremember'd, while the sudden pangs Of terror crucified the faith of all. But north of Zion, on a mountain-slope That garden where the tomb of Jesus lies Behold! impressively by vestal beams Of moonlight touch'd, his rocky grave appears; Before it, with a frequent play, the flash Of steely armour, as the Roman watch Changes and moves in circular array, Is seen; yet, save the night's uncertain sound, The fitful motion of a rambling breeze That stirs the olive, or the towering palm, And timid murmur of a garden-brook, The scene is voiceless; while on high enthroned Yon firmamental Orbs are fixed and bright, As though in wonder, that their glory falls On the dread tomb where buried Godhead lies! Still Calvary sleeps; and nothing harsh or wild The holy slumber of the Night arrests. The sentries in their panoply are ranged; Some on the gleaming worlds of air a glance Upturn, and with inaudible delight Adore their beauty; some on fairy wings Of fondness to the haunt of childhood flee Among the hills of unforgotten Rome; Or vaguely round yon high-wall'd city view The shadowy watch-towers on the vineyards raised, Or mountain dim, or Maccabean pile; While others, haply, to the tomb devote A gaze of sorrow, for that righteous Form They helped to rivet on the Cursed Tree! But in that syncope, that solemn trance, When darkness as a fading thought decays Amid the glimmer of increasing dawn, Like God in thunder, hark! an earthquake-throb While the rock quivers as a shaken reed! In rushing glory down the sky advanced A giant Angel; from the tomb he roll'd The barrier-stone, and on it sat, and blazed. His face was lightning! and as dazzling snow His vestment glitter'd: with a clang of arms Prone on the earth affrighted soldiers fell! And as Eliphaz, when the vision spake, Upon the Formless turn'd a fearful gaze, They look'd—were blasted—like the dead they lay! And then Emmanuel from the grave arose Invisible; all paramount and pure The Resurrection and the Life He stood, Lord of the tomb, victorious and sublime! Oh, then Captivity was captive led; Satan unthroned; His domination spoil'd; Hell-gates were sunder'd, and from earthy sleep The dead awaking, as they lived and moved Felt on their brows a beam immortal play! But He who moved invisible to man, To guardian woman did Himself reveal. As weeping Mary by the tomb remain'd And bow'd within its rocky depth to gaze, Two angel-watchers, robed in dazzling white, Were seated, where the vanish'd body lay: “Why weepest thou?” with gentlest tone they cried: “Because I know not where my stolen Lord Be taken;” back she turn'd her eye of tears, And there stood Jesus! but to her unknown. “Why weepest thou?” again was mildly heard; Then Mary, with mistaking love, replied, “If thou hast borne Him from this garden-tomb, Oh! tell me where; these hands will take Him thence.” But Jesus, vocal with His wonted voice, Responded, “Mary!” and the mourner fell Down at His feet! Rabboni she adored! Let one at midnight, when the cradling sea Hath rock'd his slumber, and a dream of Home In murmuring faintness to the soul renews Parental language, till his ocean-sleep Is harrow'd by that heart-entrancing sound, Her feeling image! such may faintly tell When Mary worshipp'd how her spirit thrill'd! 'Twas on the evening of this hallow'd day That two disciples, down a western vale To where Emmaus in the sunset show'd Her whitening cots, with pensive step approach'd. O dying hour of beautiful delight! The painter's worship and the poet's song, How few embrace thee with a purer thought Than one, whose dreaming Boyhood loved to form Romantic visions of the unreveal'd From thine own hues; when like those fairy clouds Which float and perish, yearning Fancy shaped Bright unrealities long roll'd away! Divinest evening! when thy Syrian glow On verdurous olive, sycamore, and palm Descended, not unfelt thy magic woo'd These holy pilgrims. Homeward flocks and herds Were wending; while around them richly-soft The lingering decadence of light began. But more than Nature on their brows has hung A solemn meaning! of the Day they talk, Of Death, and Resurrection; such their theme, When, silent as the shadow of their forms, Another came! and mingled word with word, In deep communion. Then of Christ He spake; From prophecy to prophecy unroll'd Each revelation, till the shade of doubt Fell from their spirit like a film removed From Blindness, letting in the light of heaven. But when, abiding to partake their meal, He sat before them, and the Blessing gave, That Eye, so eloquent with awe devout, That voice heaven-toned, that superhuman Mien Declared Messiah! Now at once He gazed Upon them, featured like that living Christ So often follow'd, worshipp'd,—and forsook! Within them how each wondering heart had burn'd To hear Him as an Oracle reveal The Word of Life, God's Everlasting Will! But like a vision of the soul He fled. Then back they speeded, to th' Eleven rehearsed Their tale of wonder: when again behold! Th' Incarnate Saviour! “Peace be with you! hail!” Becalming thus with salutation mild Th' appall'd Assembly, on them all He breathed His Holy Spirit, and to each bestow'd O'er sin a power, to pardon or retain. But Thomas doubted, till his hand could touch The living Jesus! lo! again He came Inaudibly, within a chamber barr'd; So like a Spirit of the shapeless air He enter'd, that o'erawed disciples quaked! “Thy finger hither reach, These hands behold, And thrust thine own within My wounded side, Not faithless, but believing!” Thus He spoke To him who answer'd “Saviour, Lord, and God!” Once more upon the lake Messiah view, Whose azure waters at His word o'erfill'd With countless fish the Galilean bark, Which night had baffled; then was Peter ask'd That threefold question, threefold wisdom fill'd With memory of his denial thrice! And yet, so toned with tenderness divine, The soul of Peter in his fond reply, “Thou knowest I love thee!” spake with answering tears. And now, the Counsel of eternal Love, Mysterious, vast, omniscient as profound, Wrapt in the folds of Heaven's decretive Will Before the universe was shaped or born, Concludeth! Man's Redemption is complete, And sanction'd; all the archetypal Plan Of Deity, for reconciling grace With justice, by the mediating Blood Of covenant, in Christ has been fulfill'd. The Woman's Seed hath bruised the Serpent's Head; For Man hath lived, for Man hath bled, and died, Soar'd from the grave, and His true Person shown Not in the midnight, when the spirit shapes An earthless phantom; but by living day Was risen Jesus handled, seen and heard. But, ere ascending to His seat on high, Again the apostolic Band He taught The true Salvation, in its glorious light. From age to age prophetically sung, By type and shadow heralded or seen, Begotten Son of Co-Eternal Sire, His goings forth from Everlasting were! Before the works of Old, ere earth began, When God His compass on the waters set And gave the sea commandment,—He was there! The Star; the Prophet, like to Moses raised; The Priest for ever, on the Right Hand placed Of glory, while the sun and moon endure,— Dominion o'er all nations, kings, and isles, To Him was given, whom the Gentiles sought; Born of a Virgin; perfect God and Man; Desire of nations; He whom Daniel saw, Ancient of Days; by king and kingdoms served; The Heritor of Heathens and the Throne Of David: higher than the Heaven of Heavens, Expressive Semblance of the bright Unseen! And Morning-Star of Immortality; The Light of Light, unspotted Lamb of God, For sin an Offering, and for sinners slain, But now arisen from the tomb to soar Eternal Saviour of forgiven man!— Thus in the beams of revelation shone The great Messiah: thus the cloudy veil Of error from their souls He took, and cried, “Go forth! repentance and remission teach, Baptising Nations in the Name triune Of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Behold All living Unction from the Spirit's grace From Me shall clothe you, as the promise spake; Within the City tarry till they come, Lo! I am with you to the ended world.” My soul is shaken with a mighty Dream! Dominion, Majesty, and Truth proceed In blended union from the deeps of Heaven. I hear the gates of second Eden ope, And balm and freshness on the blighted world Come flowing forth with universal love And Earth regenerate with redemption's smile. And hark! the echoes of a choral strain Above; a new and Everlasting Song Is chanted, for the seven-seal'd Book unroll'd The Lamb hath open'd; and symphonious hymns Of thousand times ten thousand Saints ascend The Throne around: “Hosannah to the Lamb!” For He is worthy! shout, ye Angels! shout Till Earth re-echoes that unwearied strain! Let sun, let moon, and each melodious star, The winds, the rivers, mountains, floods, and hills, The diapason deepen, and the loud Eternal hallelujah of the Sea Wake into sound; while regions, zones, and isles, The glory of our great Redeemer sing! And thus with angels and archangels laud The Lamb Almighty, in the skies adored! But, lo! upon Mount Olivet appears With hands uplifted in their last farewell, The parting Saviour; on His God-like brow The radiance of eternity begins: Disciples kneeling for His blessing ask, And, hark! 'tis given; on their souls He breathes The breath of sanctity, of love sublime And endless: then His mighty hand is lift, But while it blesseth the beloved of earth, The Air is waiting to upwaft its Lord. And see, He riseth! solemnly and slow, Array'd in brightness, such as God invests, In soaring grandeur from the baffled gaze Of His adorers, through the pathless air In the full lustre of unclouded day He riseth! leaving, like th' Atlantic sun On ocean when he dies a gorgeous death, A beaming track magnificently bright Behind Him; till a radiant star He seems, And then, is trackless., in celestial depths Evanish'd, soaring back to God again! But, oh, if Angels at His birth did sing, What pæans now through heaven's wide concave roll! Who welcome there the sempiternal Lord, The Son incarnate, into glory come, O'er Sin and Death victorious, with a World Recover'd, ransom'd, and for ever saved, To speak his triumph in the state of Man. The skies are kindled! from the opal walls And battlements of uncreated Light, Lo! seraphim and cherubim appear, With angel and archangel,—rank on rank In wing'd array of infinite extent And brightness, to conduct the Lord of heaven. Now lift your heads, ye Everlasting Doors, Receive the King of Glory! Hark! the choir With jubilant Hosannas shout and sing, “For ever and for ever is Thy Throne, Thou Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Hosts! By Thee of old the heaven and earth were framed, Were founded: but they all shall fade and die And as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, And they shall perish! still art Thou the same Unchanging, Holy, Holy, Lord of Hosts! Thy Throne eternal in the heavens resume Almighty Saviour, and triumphant King!” My theme is o'er, the great Messiah sung; And this attempt, whose vast persuasion fill'd My being with o'erawed delight, concludes. How often, in some pause of holy fear Hath Fancy folded her adventurous wing, And my soul bow'd with this unutter'd thought, That He, whose mediatorial love I sang, Beheld me, fathoming my spirit's depth! And now, as girt with glory, in the Heaven Of Heavens the Son of Man His Throne resumes, A dread comes round me, like a shadow cast From waning tempest o'er a trancèd sea. Thou Land sublime, of miracles and men, Where Poetry from God on earth came down In warbled echoes of celestial song! Where Hebron, Tabor, and Mount Carmel, lift Their speaking vastness in the sultry air Divinely-haunted; where the Jordan rolls, Where rock, and cavern, grotto, cell and cave Are mighty; where the curse of Heaven has graved Terrific warning on thy blasted trees And haggard vales, all fountainless and dry, The stately vision of thy mingled Scene Departeth! He whose spirit oft has heard The thunder-music of thy tempest roll, Beheld thy sun-blaze, seen thine eagles mount And dream-led roved beside that mournful Lake Where man's Redeemer in His days of earth Hath wander'd,—bids thee now a long farewell! Autumnal morning round my chamber threw The gleaming wanness of its gentle smile, When tremblingly, as though omniscient Eyes Look'd on my soul, I struck the sacred Lyre And bade it warble this surpassing Theme. But ever, as the waves of moving life From England's capital, with heave and swell Came surging from afar, my soul partook A deep communion with the fate of Man Amid a sea of wide Existence toss'd, Whose billows only the Redeemer trod Secure; but left along the stormy wild A track of glory for terrestrial feet To follow, guided by the star of Heaven. But now, the Spirit of mysterious Night Comes forth, and, like a ruin'd Angel, seems All dimly-glorious, and divinely-sad: And Earth, forgetful of her primal fall, Lies in the beauty of reflected heaven. Oh! night creates the paradise of thought, Enchanting back whatever Time has wrong'd Or exiled, touch'd with that celestial hue Which faith and fancy on the Dead bestow. Emotions which the tyrant Day destroys Can now awaken, like reviving flowers; And e'en the darkness of unheavenly souls Must feel illumined, as the Eye receives From all its views, a loveliness which comes To light the dimness of the spirit's depth. As when at morning, oft a sunrise pours A stream of splendour through the window-panes Of Temple vast, to cheer its barren aisles, And on the gloom of monumental Sleep To glisten, like a resurrection-morn. Thus, life is charter'd for a nobler fate Than glory, by the breath of man bestow'd: A living world a living God reflects, Morn, noon, and night, with everlasting change! And who can hide the universe; o'erawe The Elements; the sun unseat; or mar That mighty Poem which the heavens and earth Exhibit, written by Eternal Hands? A sense of beauty, which is so divine, Haunts human nature with undying spell; And while the wonders of creation teem, To love and worship their majestic power, Can lift the spirit into purer light Than ever canopied the throne of Fame. And cold the heart, whose aspirations wing'd Their flight from thee, my own inviolate Land! Whom night and beauty have apparell'd now. Thy heavens are stainless, as the molten blue Of ocean, in the noontide's dazzling sleep; Thy starry multitudes their thrones have set; And the young Moon gazeth on yon quiet sea Tranced like a mother, with her doating eye Intently fix'd upon a cradled child. While, round, and full, and ravishingly bright, A planet here and there the sky adorns. A path of lustre has o'erlaid the Deep, Which heaves and glitters, like a wizard shore For sea-enchanters, when they rise and walk The waves in glory: voice nor foot profanes This dreaming silence; but the mellow lisp Of dying waters on the beach dissolved, Makes ocean-language for the heart and hour. Now thought is heaven-like; and our earthly frame Of Purity beyond the day to bring, Is conscious. From the uncreated Fount Of Glory, may not emanations steal, By night absorbed, and mystically felt? Or creatures, such as once the mental eye Of seraph-haunted Milton saw descend Like sunbeams darted from a riven cloud On Eden's mount, with viewless wing career Around us, charming with a gaze unseen Whate'er the beauty of their glances touch? But oh! dark Spirit, whose unquiet shade Our fancy visions in reflected gloom, Again thou comest! and thy frown declares What penal agonies, what groans and pangs, In this calm hour a bleeding World contains! E'en now, the curtains of Futurity Are shaken, by the blasts of coming doom! For Self has overshadow'd Love divine With dread oblivion; till our daring thoughts To helm the Universe, and guide the wheels Of human Fate, have awfully presumed! A Mind which glories in the world of Man And graves, immortal! on the meanest brow, Oh! how it loves the universe, and longs To see the spirits whom Redemption won Annihilate the hopes of Hell! Shall souls, So highly destined, that a swell of joy Heaves o'er the harp of Heaven's resounding choir When Sin repents, be perfected and lost? No! let us, as the prince of morning quells A cloudy tempest with imperial rays, So learn to vanquish with celestial light Our Sin and Darkness, till, as demons shrunk To shapeless nothing at Messiah's look, Our Vices wither from our Virtues' gaze. Amid deep Energies which now unfold Like harmonies from some awaking lyre, Wilt Thou, divinest of all Arts divine! Last in the train of renovating Truths Advance, poetical Enchantress? Muse, Who art the Angel of the soul, whose voice The primal loveliness of vanish'd Things Renews; or haply, thou in pure perfection art A Priestess, who behind the veil of sense Conducts the Spirit to the holy shrine Where Beauty, Love, and Everlasting Light Are shrouded; or, a Prophetess, whose lip Their power interprets with a vocal spell. Thou beautiful Magician! be thy name Whate'er Thou wilt: Creatress of delight Expression paints not! though the World affright Thy radiant visit, still art Thou revered; And the soft wave of Thy descending wings Is token'd by the pulse's quivering joy. Beneath the play of thy melodious smiles Our spirit quickens into thrills of heaven, And Feeling worships at thy faintest sound! All hours are thine; all climes and seasons drink Thine effluence bright, and immaterial power. Thou with the Universe twin-born didst rise! And Thou alone, when tempted Nature fell, Unfallen wert: and thus Thy glorious aim Like true religion's, is to lead us back From recreant darkness to primeval bliss. All moods are Thine; all maladies of thought By thee are visited with healing sway. In those dread moments, when a hideous veil Of darkness, woven by some demon-hand, Lies on the world; when Love itself is cold Or earthly; and the tone Affection breathes Falls fruitless on the mind, as ocean-spray Which dies unheeded on the savage rock; When Nature is untuned, and all things wear The coarse reality Derision loves, E'en then, how often thine assuasive balm Spirit of beauty! intellectual queen! Descendeth, melting over heart and brain Like dew upon the desert, till the soul Revives, and this bad World seems exorcised! And Thou canst hallow with ennobling power High impulses, of superhuman sway, Which come like shades of pre-existent Life Athwart the mind, when dream-eyed Fancy rules. For is not Man mysteriously begirt By something dread, imagination feels, Yet fathoms not? Dare human Creed deny That mortal feeling, in its finest mood, May be some thrill of sympathetic chords Which link our nature to a world unknown! And since the spirit with the flesh doth war, And Life is oft an agonising thirst Which nothing visible can tame, or cool, That Beauty, which the hues of thought create, By thee enchanted, slakes the mental fire That parches us within: and yearning dreams And hopes which breathe of immortality Thy power ennobles with mysterious aid. Then, long as Earth is round us, and the wings Of Fancy by the light of faith ascend, May Poetry her sibyl-language weave, Enlighten, charm, and elevate the world. Creation's hope! our universal All! From Thee alone believing spirits learn That man is deathless, an immortal heir Of Being yet to be. Stupendous thought! Though frail as dew thy fleeting life departs, The Soul is godlike! world on world may rise And wither, quench'd in everlasting gloom; And surging ages into silence roll Like haughty billows which have heaved and died; But still unfading, bright with awful bliss, Or pale with agony, the Soul shall live And like Jehovah, utter its “I am!” We shall not sleep, but we shall all arise For judgment;—with an instantaneous frame Of being, Dust shall look on God, and live! An hour is coming when the grave will hear And answer to a tomb-awakening trump Which thunders o'er the icy trance of Death: The waning universe, the earth and heaven Shall vanish in th' immeasurable Deep; But Thine own promise shall not pass away. And though that hour, for resurrection doom'd, Be hidden, shrouded from angelic mind A secret buried in Eternal Thought,— As certain as the blood of Christ hath flow'd, Messiah risen, and the heavens received And throned His Presence, He shall come again! And then, the funeral of Creation see! Sun, moon, and star dissolve, and wane, and die; The earth is riven; with appalling roar The Sea departeth, as her dead ascend; And wing'd Archangels on the winds unroll Their summons; not an atom but is thrill'd With life or feeling, at that dreadful sound! And now look up! behold, He cometh! clouds And splendours, with seraphic armies, throng Before Him, cleaving the prophetic sky With vanward glory, to announce The God. And lo! the semblance of His far-off Throne Advances; as embodied lustre bright The Judge of Earth, the Son Almighty, comes! And all who have been, since creation was, Moveless and countless, on their features wear A solemn radiance, from His Form Divine Reflected; every eye is fix'd and still, To Him upraised, whose eye discerneth all! Again the trumpet! and this dread array, The multitudinous and living mass At once is sever'd; right and left they stand Divided, as of old the fated sea. Was cloven when the wand of Moses waved; And in each soul there is a judgment-throne Erected, where eternal Conscience reigns. But listen!—far behind this breathing host Of mortals, myriads of colossal Shapes, Unearthly, wild, and dim with ghastly wo, Rise in the glare!—the ruin'd Angels come From darkness, and a clank of chain resounds Appallingly, above the world distinct! But One, who, vast above the vastest there In towering majesty the sky confronts, As though the fabric of the heavens would shrink From the dark light of his unfathom'd gaze, Behold him! how magnificently dread! From the huge mountain into embers sunk To the last billow of expiring sea,— O'er all the terror of his ruin frowns, Who battled with omnipotence in heaven And will be fearless in the fires of hell! Another gaze! e'er Earth and Nature die; The Spirit of eternity descends, Seven thunders speak, to heaven his arm He lifts, And utters, “Time and earth shall be no more:” Creation withers at that dread command, And like a shade, the Universe departs! Oh! in this agony of Nature's death May he, who dared from erring fancy's gloom To lift his spirit to the Light of Light, And shadow forth some lineaments divine Of God Incarnate, by redemption seen, Unblasted look upon the Lord he sang: And in yon world unutterably bright Where thought is holy as the heaven it breathes, By Angels taught, around The Throne renew The song eternal hymning Time began. MINOR POEMS. WELLINGTON: OR, THE HERO'S FUNERAL. TO HER WHO NUMBERS MORE THAN TWENTY RELATIONS THAT HAVE FOUGHT AND SERVED UNDER ARTHUR, DUKE OF WELLINGTON, THE FOLLOWING ATTEMPT IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY HER HUSBAND. “The mighty Man, and the Man of War, The Judge and the Prophet, and the Prudent And the Ancient and the Honourable Man.” Is. iii. 2, 3. “The King lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. And the King said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel.”—2 Sam. iii. 32—38. “SATIS DIU VIXISSE DICITO.” I. INTRODUCTION. Through England's capital no rest tonight! Where sleepless myriads watch for morning light, Whose hearts concentre in one vast regret To feel the fullness of that awful debt A shielded Empire to her saviour owes, When grey-hair'd Glory finds its last repose Under the crypt, where storied banners wave Their drooping pageant o'er some public grave. With a fev'rish awe opprest, And a something in the breast Neither tones nor tears explain, Like a mute and mighty pain, Or a pulse of voiceless grief Too august for word-relief, Millions now are slumberless; And in thinking loneliness Are brooding o'er the unbreath'd thought,— To-morrow down to dust is brought That hoary Chief, whose high career Will range half Europe round his bier; Who fifteen battles fought and won Nor left nor lost a British gun, But took three thousand cannon from the foe The thunder of his charge had laid in battle low! A COMPARISON. But while the riband, star, and coronet With mingled radiance in one warrior met, Austerely simple to the last he stood, A hero great by being good! In unity of heart and mind Thus he and Nelson are combined For prowess, deeds, and all we prize When perils round a nation rise: The first became the Nelson of all lands, The second proved our Wellington by sea; And both were weapon'd by Almighty hands To guard the island-fortress of the free: Nor when the bomb-shell blazed, and roll'd the culverin From iron lips of death its thunder and its din, From Tagus to the Thames From Sambre to the Seine Is there a brand that shames The spot where he hath been!— The Man was never in the Hero lost Nor Valour glorified at Virtue's cost. II. NIGHT-SCENES ON NOVEMBER 17. November's night is harsh and cold; Like banners seem the clouds up-roll'd Sable and dusk, in starless heaven, And, here and there, by night-gales driven; Fiercely and fast the loud-toned rain Rattles against the window-pane; But neither wet nor winter's chill The mingled rush becalm of myriads coming still:— Through dusky lane, and street, or lighted square London is moved, and motion ev'rywhere! MIDNIGHT. But at last, there seems a lull Making night more beautiful. Chariot, steed, and rapid car With fainter cadence roll afar; Till a deeper hush is come, And the wide and wakeful hum Ebbs and falls, and dies away Like a dream-tone's melting play. Through their rent and riven shrouds Planets beam from yonder clouds; Pallid stars patrol the sky, And arrest some musing eye, While yon weak and wat'ry moon, Like a soft and silver noon On the turret gleams awhile With a pale and placid smile. Soon o'er the varied City's vast extent A deep'ning stillness from the night is sent; And the calmer few who can Master all the scenes of man, Keeping down the pulse of life When it throbs in storm or strife,— Feel the balm of slumber now Brooding over cheek and brow; Those that work, and they who weep, Woo the mercy of mild sleep; And in soft innocence of sacred rest The babe lies pillow'd on maternal breast. III. DAWN. But the cloudy dawn is waking And the day-blush dimly breaking: Again the fevers of excitement roll Tides of emotion through that public soul Which heaves vast London, while 'mid hearts that mourn, A dead Immortal to his tomb is borne. A thrilling freshness in the bracing air Gives sudden token that the wind is fair; Or the blue forehead of the Sky afar Glows like a gem of lustre one lone star, Whose quiv'ring radiance, exquisitely bright, Throbs through the air, and fascinates the sight. Relenting Winter hath subdued her rain, And, lo! the clearing heavens are calm again:— A beaming change of blessed weather To welcome hearts convened together, As though the conscious Atmosphere would pay Some genial homage to this glorious day. IV. MORNING. And now go forth!—a spectacle to see Eternalized in mind and memory. Yet, when the Muse of History records The pomp we celebrate, in deathless words, She will not pause o'er car and cavalcade, Or mailéd hosts in banner'd pomp array'd; But this will be the truth, to tell,— That Empires loved one Man so well, A million and a half of mourners came Whose hearts were motto'd with his cherish'd name! The People make the pageant then; His monument is living men; And never in the past of hero-crowded time Look'd Hannibal so great, or Pompey so sublime! And why? because the Chief of Waterloo Teaches all ages what firm Will can do When, all intol'rant of the mean and low, Virtue his friend, and Vice his only foe, Each baser passion from the bosom hurl'd,— The vanquisher of Self is victor of the World! Career and character, where thus combined, Both make and move the hist'ry of mankind, When perill'd Crisis and o'erwhelming Power Need more than strategy to front the hour. V. On window, roof, and balcony, Where foot can stand, or eye can see; By churchyard-gate, or garden-wall, Near porch and palace, hut and hall Crowd human forms, like clust'ring bees That swarm at noon on summer-trees; While, clashing with incessant jar, Rush chariot-wheels and rolling car; Horse and horsemen then combine, Clear the way, and close the line:— Still, the trooping thousands come! Deeper yet the distant hum; Ev'ry form and ev'ry face Apparell'd with emotion's trace; Each for each, and all on all For succour in loud chorus call, Till the whirling air around Surges like a sea of sound! VI. THE PROCESSION FORMS. 'Tis eight o'clock by matin-chime; And signal-guns announce the time, While countless numbers, mute with breathless trance, Seem melted into one, to view the Pomp advance. With ling'ring preludes, long and low, Comes marching on, serene and slow, 'Mid symphonies of solemn woe Yon Cavalcade of Death! With mourning trump and muffled drum Behold the vast procession come, And hold your pausing breath! Cornet, flute, and clarion pour Mingled death-wails more and more; Bannerets and blazonry With plumes of tow'ring pageantry, Mingled with the harness'd gun, Streaming Flag and Gonfalon, Colours out of carnage won, Rifles, Horse, and Fusileer, Dragoon, Marine, and Grenadier, And scar-worn Pensioners, with sable wands That faintly quiver'd in their feeble hands, Steed and soldiers' measured pace, Wearing each some mourning-trace, While sob and sigh intensely show The heavings of the heart below, All this, with heavy tramp, and hollow tread, To symbolise they mourn the dead,— Concentre, if thou can, the harmonising whole, And treasure it with tears of sympathy and soul! VII. THE CHARGER. But yet awaits a tearful Sight, Though not with martial splendour dight. As some lone bugle, when the fight is done, That wails a death-note, while the dying sun Goes down on carnage-cover'd fields, O'er sad imagination wields A spell more potent than the cannon-roar, So, yon last steed which bears its Chief no more, Pierces the heart with pathos all its own And moves each chord with some responsive tone; Where now, the last to close the cavalcade That through three miles its winding pomp display'd, A groom-led Charger riderless Comes drooping in its loneliness, As though the meek-eyed Creature felt Funereal sorrow through it melt. And, who that saw the boot and spur, And did not feel his life-blood stir, When that denuded Steed a type was made to be That glory is the garb earth puts on vanity! VIII. MILITARY SCENE. Hark! again the muffled drum, While the plumed Battalions come Timing deep their measured tread To the March surnamed the Dead, Six in file, in single rank, Ringing out a hollow clank:— Mingle with the martial scene Mailéd Guard and red Marine, Foot and Horse-Artillery, And brigades of Infantry: For thus, each Regiment sent its type to show Some fitting token of funereal woe; And when, to end the vast array, Hussar and Lancer lined the way, The wailing Piper, next, a pibroch blew And coronach that thrill'd the soul of Feeling through! IX. FUNERAL-CAR. But lo! with gloomy scutcheons glorious Each telling of the Past victorious, Engraved by heraldry of war, Comes rolling on the laurell'd Car Under the shade of whose triumphant pall Imagination dreams the earthly all Of Arthur, Duke of Wellington!— The greatest Hero Time has gazed upon. And never since bereavèd patriots met In solemn anguish and sublime regret Round the mourn'd bier of warrior, saint or king, Could grateful Mem'ry into action bring Such impulses of thrilling awe As sanctified the scene I saw, Drawn by twelve steeds of sable hue When first the Death-car roll'd in view. X. A LIVING SPECTACLE. 'Twas not the pomp, the banner, nor the plume, Nor all which glorifies a Warrior's tomb, That touch'd with superhuman power The awful pathos of that deathless hour. 'Twas moral Grandeur! 'twas the true sublime Of sacred Nature soaring out of time, And drinking in from worlds which faith can see The inspirations of eternity. And one such moment grasps an age of life, With more than poetry and passion rife; Making us feel immortal instincts rise And claim celestial kinship with the Skies. XI. Round that high Car though countless hosts assembled, And under pawing steeds the pathways trembled, You might have heard your heart-pulse beat, So hush'd became the o'eraw'd Street! And pale, as if with inward prayer, The living Mass stood gazing there, With heads uncover'd and with moisten'd eyes, Whose silence utter'd, “There a Hero lies! From whom, when call'd to bid the earth farewell, The truncheons of eight laurell'd Armies fell; The pillar of our Church and State, By self-renouncement nobly great; Who in the storm of public danger stood Bold as the rock that baffles ocean's flood, And when the lion-flag of warfare was unfurl'd Bade Vict'ry rear it high, and wave it round the world!” XII. EUROPEAN HOMAGE. Upon his honour'd Bier, attendant, With nodding plume and waving pendant, Alone not Britain sent the bearers of his pall; But, moved by gallant chivalry That breathed of heart-nobility, Seven Marshals graced with Heraldry, From foreign lands, spontaneously from all, Have come to tell of his career Whose prowess friend and foe revere, Each bearing in the crape-bound hand Some bâton of extinct command Monarchs or princes had in life bestow'd On that brave Chief, to whom their Kingdoms owed A vaster debt than peerless Rank can pay, Or golden Orders in their gemm'd array. Belgium and Prussia, Portugal and Spain, And distant Russia, from her ice-bound plain, With Hanover, and England too, Remember'd mighty Waterloo! But Austria sent no warrior-chief Her own to blend with British grief; Coldly apart from those united kings Who each their homage to a Hero brings, Preferr'd to stand, and gracelessly forget The Past she burdens with an unpaid debt, Because a woman-scourger in his body felt A Nemesis for that vile blow he dealt; Alas! that in an hour like this, the pride Of less than Littleness was gratified! And caused a Kingdom thus to stand alone, Nor honour Him who saved her shaken throne. XIII. VETERANS AND MOURNERS. But turn we to a nobler theme. How mournful, then, their martial dream Who, while around them tramp and stir The Herald, Troop, and Trumpeter, Were haunted with a blent array Of scenes which ne'er dissolve away; And imaged forth with mind's creative eye The Man who taught them how to dare, and die, As, trench'd with many a battle-scar, The white-hair'd Veterans of war Gather and group beside yon bier, And scarce can hide the welling tear! Past sharers in dread fields of blood Full oft with him these comrades stood, When valour beam'd from that victorious brow Which cold in coffin'd death lay plumeless now! And could they view those guns, whose dauntless roar Thunder'd proud Albion's name from shore to shore, Or on the steed, array'd in boot and spur, Fix their sad eyes, nor feel the dead Past stir Within them, like a living thought With years of resurrection fraught? On Torres Vedras' bulwark'd lines Again the flag of England shines! Vimiera's field, and Salamanca's fight, And Talavera's, when it roused the night, Sebastian's siege, and Badajos' return, And Albuera, with its conflict stern: Visions of battle and campaign arise And flash before their unforgetting eyes!— From the first laurel gain'd at dread Assaye, To the red carnage on that thrilling day Embalm'd for ever in sublime renown, When England struck the Gallic Eagle down, And the War-Fiend, who half a world had won, Sank wither'd by the blast of Wellington! Thus, round the coffin of th' heroic Dead A living atmosphere of love is spread That glows with hist'ry, till the pluméd bier Is almost hidden by a warrior's tear. The shock of Armies, and the battle-shout Of charging Valour, when it put to rout Column and cavalry in fierce attack, Ring through his brain, and bring the dead Years back: Till fancy hears the loud “Hurrah!” That Picton raised at Quatre-Bras Where royal Brunswick closed his eye, While, bivouack'd beneath the sky, Some bleeding sentinel who watch'd the night Heard the last bugle that bewail'd the fight. XIV. PROCESSION TO THE CATHEDRAL. Again we listen! for the cornet's wail Pours on the wind its melancholy tale. Upward, o'er the troop-lined way Flank'd in full and firm array, Still the banner'd Pomp proceedeth, Horse and horseman onward leadeth; Mourning hearts with inward chime To the Dead March beating time; Near and nearer still they come To the Hero's burial-home, Under the arching shade of yon cathedral-dome. XV. FAREWELL. Ere between the church-yard gate Car and cavalcade have enter'd, Still for thoughtful eyes await Such a scene and sight concenter'd, As all the pomps which fascinate the gaze, The wreaths of conquest, and the palms of praise Can rival not, But sink forgot, When England's sworded Prince appears; And, marching by him, touch'd with manly tears, Saluting warriors slowly move, And shadow forth the signs of love On face and feature, which betoken What quiv'ring words could not have spoken, But now with tearful eloquence they tell,— The British army bid their Chief farewell! XVI. ST. PAUL'S. 'Mid radiant masses of reposing light Yon Temple seems dilated to the sight, While vast perspectives of cathedral-gloom Whose drap'ry serves to symbolise the tomb, Entrance the gazer with absorbing spell As though some Vision on the spirit fell. Thoughts of earth and thrills from heaven Thus to each and all are given, And accost the inner-sense With a dumb, deep eloquence, Such as Faith and Conscience hear When they bend around the bier. Now enter there! survey that vaulted Dome Encircled o'er with beads of golden light, As though a supernat'ral noon had come To glorify the realms of night. Round the curved base a wreath of lustre glances, High o'er its many-pictured roof advances, And lights, as if with living play, Gigantic forms in war-array: From capital to capital Through transept and pilaster'd wall Down nave and aisle the line of lustre streams O'er circled tiers of dome-ascending seats, Till the last row some closing pillar meets, Where soft effulgence tremulously gleams. But not by picture-words of poetry Yon mass of concentrated human kind In hues of language can reflected be, As e'er to fascinate and fill the mind, And realise what they beheld, With voiceless wonder inly quell'd, Whose spell-bound eyes o'ergazed the mighty Whole, And caught the magic of the mind and soul Which beam'd from ev'ry face in that funereal throng, Beyond the painter's hue, above the poet's song! Throne and Altar, Bench and State, Brave and wise, and good and great, All Britain welcomes with revering eye, Fill'd the hush'd Fane where buried heroes lie, And ocean's warrior, in his tomb sublime, Waits the last trump which rings the knell of Time. Another gaze! while amber'd sunbeams fall And through the lofty dome-light streaming, Come slanting downward on the concave wall With more than earth-born radiance gleaming,— On tinted robes in tremulous array Pulses of painted lustre seem to play. But, hark! before the western-gate A solemn Dead-March sounds; And, moving in sepulchral state, Approaches to its hallow'd bounds The last Procession; while the booming knell Blends its deep cadence with the organswell. Planted by each bearer's hand, Flag and Guidon take their stand; Inglitt'ring column, robed with gorgeous vest, A double file of grouping warriors rest Around yon hidden burial-place; While Choir and Clergy up the nave Marshal and move, and gleam and wave Their priestly robes, as on they pace. And mark, along the living mass Electrical emotions pass!— Profound, unreason'd, an instinctive awe Of something deeper than mere Vision saw, Thrills the mute concourse, till they meekly rise With all the patriot glist'ning in their eyes; And feelings not of this world clothe each brow, As on, with measured tread, advances now The choir-procession, while the burial-chant With resurrection-tones so jubilant, Peals the dead Warrior on his pluméd bier, 'Mid sigh, and sob, and many a martial tear, Onward to his long, last home Underneath th' illumined Dome! But as the wind-bow'd plumes were bending High o'er his coffin-lid depending, How life and death together seem'd to be And awed the gazer like a Mystery! XVII. Thus amidst the boom of bells Tolling their funereal-knells, The organ-peal, and cannon-roar Re-echoed round the temple-door, With all due pomp of heraldry, With each befitting pageantry, 'Mid waving banners to his tomb is borne Great Wellington!—and soon shall wailing horn And cadence of the muffled drum Tell the awed Soul the last is come! For, ducal crown and scutcheon'd bier Will be engulph'd, and disappear; Down the chasm, dark and deep Yearning eyes will strain and weep; Then, the staff of office broken Will reveal its sign and token; And the Garter-King proclaim More than ever earth-wide fame Gave heroic Man before, Or the brightest patriot bore. THE BURIAL. Like dream-heard music when it melts away Serenely dying, sad and slow, Thus from the living air and light of day Adown the vaulted crypt below The coffin'd frame of Wellington Descends,—recedes,—and all is gone! And o'er it deepens with expressive gloom The yawning darkness of that open Tomb, Where Nelson sleeps, but now, where two are laid In death's cold slumber, side by side; Of whom hereafter 'twill be nobly said, Millions were mourners when they died! And in the Temple, where he lies Entomb'd with martial obsequies, Oh! never since that Shrine of prayer Lifted its cross in sun and air, Or choral praise with chanted swell Upon the ears of Godhead fell, Have quiring voices breathed an anthem-tone, From sixteen thousand melted into one, The diapàson of whose deep Amen To earth seem echo'd back from glory-realms again! XVIII. CONCLUSION. The booming echoes of the minute-gun Hark! how they roll from London's castle-towers, Proclaiming the sepulchral rites are done: Yet, ere the World resume its wonted powers, While dying notes from many a distant knell Sink into silence with a sad farewell, A moralising gloom on man descends And not unfitly with the Pageant blends. NATURE'S ANALOGY. In red magnificence of evening-dyes, Oft like a paradise of cloud there lies A pomp aërial, such as poets love, When beauty consecrates the heavens above. There, musing on some breezy height, Enthroned in loveliness and light, A lone spectator stands to view The day-god wear his parting hue, When gliding down the crimson'd west He wraps him in his regal vest.— How exquisite awhile to be Surrender'd up to Sky and Sea! As drinking in the splendid whole He mingles with Creation's soul, While lisping waves, with pensive lull, And cadence faintly-beautiful, Chime with the hour, till earth and air An elemental magic wear, And so entrance impassion'd Hearts, The soul forgets, the Scene departs.— But while they dream, the cloud-pomp dies A beauteous death along the skies; The pallid dews of night descend, And dimness and dejection end Those witching spells of sunset-hour Which give to poesy its power. XIX. MORAL CONTRAST. So would it be when this great Day shall close Which bore the Warrior to his dead repose, If tinsell'd pageantry or painted scene Gave the true witness which the day hath been. But when the blazonry of public Woe Fades from our vision, like an air-born show, The deep significance which underlies All outer-forms is one that never dies, But melts into the moral life within And prompts that spirit where those Aims begin Which soar beyond a passion for renown, And learn from Duty how to win the crown. For England's people, from the humblest clan Of working poor and toil-worn artisan, From town, from hamlet, and the hawthorn-side Where the lone cotters in contentment bide, Have each received within responsive mind Ennobling thoughts which elevate mankind. And thus, perchance, when other palms are won, Time will reveal how much this day hath done To form the patriot in the public heart; Or, teach the warrior his predestined part, And sow, as far as pure Example can, Those seeds, whose harvest is—heroic Man! Mere vulgar Heroes of the vicious stamp Whose names suggest a carnage, or a camp, Meteors of Crime, the monsters of the past Who sweep the world with desolating blast, And when they perish in their dread career Leave Time to track them by the widow's tear,— May point the moral of some future page: But, when the Warrior, Senator, and Sage Meet in one man, like Him we mourn to-day, Conscience predicts, what unborn years will say;— That he had pass'd into the Nation's heart Of which he grew a principal and part; And when he died, far more than boundless Grief Sought in the burial-pomp a fit relief,— Each for himself put fun'ral raiment on, And wept a friend in mourning Wellington. XX. PATRIOTISM. And Thou, environ'd with thy zone of waves, Nursling of waters! whom old Ocean laves As though He loved to hear his billow-roar Champion the rocks which sentinel thy shore; Intrepid Isle! whose amaranthine bays Bloom in the light of Heaven's approving gaze; Defender of the Faith in Christendom's great heart! Well may we proudly think on this day what Thou art, And, pond'ring o'er th' imperishable past, See Glory's halo round thy hist'ry cast! Let Patriots boast of thine and thee, Of Commerce, Arms, and Chivalry, Of princely homes, of palace-halls, Of Culture, and whate'er recals How lofty Will can dare, and lion-heart can do, When Trafalgar became an ocean-Waterloo: 'Tis right to let such feeling reign, And when dead Ages breathe again, O'er the harp-string of the soul Like a lyric rapture roll. And their proud boast is purer still If Thou thy mission-work fulfil, As dauntless champion of the Truth to stand And brighten Europe like a beacon-land, By teaching tyrants who would crush the mind, 'Tis sacrilege!—for God is there enshrined. Thus sacred law and liberty unite A Prince's sceptre with the People's right, And in the thunder of a bold-voiced Press Nations can utter forth their nobleness, Who find in scripture, when it frees the soul, A Magna Charta which sublimes the whole! THE PEOPLE. Yet bounds the heart with patriotic bliss Through all excitements of a morn like this, To think, how nobly have the People proved They well can honour whom they wisely loved! For while they paid to peerless Wellington A homage Alexander never won, The lofty and the low, our peasants and our peers Have met and mingled here, unchill'd by frowns or fears, In this metropolis of varied Man Where Nature musters every type she can; And yet, no impious Wrong hath once profaned The sabbath-peace of sentiment which reign'd; But all was just, magnanimous, sincere; And, heralded by many a votive tear, The sun went down with no recorded crime And left the British character sublime! XXI. THE HERO. With parting homage let these lines conclude, And consecrate a poet's gratitude To him, the paragon of English praise, In whom Posterity's admiring gaze Will mark a Hero, who adorn'd the Earth And made the World a debtor to his worth: Best of the best, and greatest of the great In all which guards a throne, or guides a state; The massive grandeur of whose balanced mind Was so adjusted, that the Will inclined Where Conscience led, and not where Fortune threw Her fleeting radiance o'er some distant view.— His frame was iron; and with sleepless force Through half a cent'ry traced his hero-course: Abroad, at home, in Senate-house, or Field, Friendship and Hate alike to his firm counsels yield, Whose glance, by mental intuition, ran Through each dark maze of policy and plan, And reached conclusions whose results contain Maxims and morals, which will rule and reign As long as Treason, Stratagem, and War Endanger thrones, or threaten from afar. Just as the Law, inflexible as Truth, Thus lived great Wellington in age and youth; And when hoar'd years had bow'd that classic head With silver-locks so venerably spread, How did we greet him in the public Square And rouse the stranger with re-echo'd “There! “There comes The Duke! whose very shadow throws A light on England, wheresoe'er he goes;” While pausing Childhood with entrancéd eye Beheld him in his glory moving by: And though the winter of declining age Touch'd form and feature with a sad presage, In list'ning reverence how the Senate hung On the plain Saxon of that pithy tongue!— The smiting earnestness of honest speech Which taught more wisdom than mere words can reach. And hence, the Arbiter of Empires, he Reign'd on his throne of true simplicity, And by the firmness of unflinching will Rallied around him trusting Empires still:— A Kingly Subject, whose unscepter'd hand Was more than Armies, when it waved command. And this, by virtue of that noble Creed That helm'd each movement in the hour of need, The master-spell which rein'd emotion down— That danger must be met by duty to The Crown! XXII. FINAL APOSTROPHÈ. Since God descends through history to Man Whose dark vicissitudes but veil His plan, And mortal Agents, while they do and dare Are but the Organs of His purpose there, Oh, Thou! to whom the shields of earth belong, The everlasting Stronger than the Strong; Divine Upholder of heroic souls Whom prowess arms, or purity controls, Bulwark'd with blessings which reveal Thy Hand Long may the charter'd State of England stand; That peerless growth of patriotic mind, The great, eternal Wonder of mankind! Lodge in our British hearts true love of Thee And cause Thine Image on this earth to be, Whose varied destinies of weal and woe Preach the vast truth a creedless world should know,— The life of Nations is a god-like thing Beyond mere Laureates of the world to sing; Nursed and ennobled not by wealth and power Nor all the pageants which bemock the hour, But ruled by reason, and by faith sublimed To loftier heights than Glory ever climb'd. Celestial Lord of uncreated Love! Waft to our souls pure wisdom from above, And teach the secret of Thy moral plan,— The source of freedom is God's will in man, When sainted hearts have meekly understood That perfect greatness is a power for good; Typing the Godhead, Who Himself is great Not by the thunders of enthronéd state; Yet in the majesty of boundless might Wills what is law, but in that law wills right; That Saints and Seraphim alike may see Their archetypes in His eternity, And while they anthem an almighty Throne Reflect His glories, and increase their own. SHADOWS OF DEATH. (1829.) “Darest thou die.”—Shakspeare. VISION-SCENES. Throned in a vault where sleep departed kings Behold the Tyrant of the world! Around His shadowy head he waves a sceptre, made Of monumental dust; and as it moves, Before him glide a visionary throng Of ministers, that do his deadly will. First, Murder, with an eye of wolfish glare, And brow of adamantine sternness, frowns, His brooding visage blanch'd with guilt, and cold As dead revenge; then Madness, with her locks Of graceless beauty, crowding o'er a face Terrifically wild: her cheeks are shrunk As wither'd flowers, and in her fixèd eye A lustre, meaningless yet mournful, dwells; Like a pale cloud she glides along, and looks Upon her lean-worn palms, before her spread As tablets, where her idiot thoughts are traced! Next Melancholy, with a downward brow, Slow-paced, and solemn in her aspect, comes; Behind, Intemperance, with degraded face, Complexion'd like the redden'd clouds, which clasp The dying sun; then Anger, with a storm Of meaning hung upon her blacken'd front, And Terror, eloquently dumb, appear. With step as noiseless as the slumbering air, Who comes, in beautiful decay?—her eyes Dissolving with a feverish glow of light, Her pallid nostrils delicately closed, Her ringlets gathered in a languid wreath, And on that cheek, once round with health's rich bloom, A hectic tinge, as if the fairy tip Of Beauty's finger faintly press'd it there: Alas! Consumption is her fatal name. But lo, a contrast! fierce with shining mail, Sublime in aspect and supreme in gait, Waving a crimson banner o'er his head, With giant pace, stalks by terrific War! His task?—To shatter thrones, and sully kings. To these sad ministers of Death, succeed Of Maladies a hideous crew; not least Appalling, Pestilence, with eyes aghast, And Famine, withered to a woful form. Next, Phantoms round the Lord of human dust In pallid indistinctness rise and move For mental slaughter fearfully predoom'd! Despair, with hollow, dim, sepulchral eyes; And Love, the martyr of his own fix'd stake: Ambition, with a canker-eaten soul; And Genius, proud and pale, the self-consumed, Whose gaze Infinity with spirit-light Hath kindled, while the pining form decays Like colour from a fainting cloud of eve! CONTRASTS. Such are thy delegates, disastrous Power! Which make the martyr'd world thy prey, and seize Their victims when and where they please. Alike To thee the palace or the hut, the hall Of Pleasure or the house of Wo.—A king Mounts his high throne, with starry robes begirt; Each look commands, and bright that royal brow Beneath the burden of his jewell'd crown; Before him princely courtiers bow their heads, And on their fawning cheeks his smiles reflect, And hover round him like a human god! Thy bow is bent, thy dooming arrow shot, And like a cloud-shade by the sun destroyed Melts the great monarch from his pride and power! The pale companion of the speechless earth, A vault his palace, like his brother clay Corrupted—bid his Court adore him now! ANTICIPATIONS. To die!—this gorgeous world of life and love Forsake, and fleet beyond the bounds of thought; To feel the death-dews creeping o'er each limb, Our life-stream curdle, and the heart grow cold; To be the flesh-worm's feast; to mould away And blend our being with embracing dust; All this, together with imagined wails Of friends, whose tearful eyes attend our bier,— Calls a chill horror round the name of death, Which daunts the good, and makes the bad despair. ANALOGIES. All that we love and feel in nature's world Bears dim relations to our common doom. The clouds that blush, and die an airy death, Or melt in weeping showers; the pensive streams Whose tones are dying music; leaves new-born, Which fade unpitied in the frosty arms Of Winter, there to mingle with dead flowers, Are all prophetic of our own decay. And who, when hung enchanted o'er some page Where genius flashes from each living line— Hath never wander'd to the tomb, to see The hand that penn'd it or the head that thought? Dark feelings, coloured by the cloud of death, With grand oppression thus the mind o'erflow, As when some warm adorer of the dead Who live, along the dim and banner'd aisle Of arch'd cathedral, frames a dream sublime, And learns how eloquent a tomb can be: Or roams at twilight, where the Deep resounds, To watch the ever-rolling waves converge To where faint ocean weds the sky, and think, Thus roll the restless hours of time along! ASSOCIATIONS. In banquet-halls, where queenly pleasures bloom, And bright-faced Joy and young-eyed Beauty meet, To them the shadows of the grave extend. How oft, as unregarded on a throng Of lovely creatures, in whose liquid eyes The heart-warm feelings bathe, I've fondly look'd With all a Poet's passion, and have wish'd That years might never mar those perfect smiles,— How often Death, as with a viewless wand Has touched the scene, and witch'd it to a tomb, Where beauty dwindled to a ghastly wreck While moaning spirits of the Future cried, Thus will it be when Time has work'd revenge! LIFE A GRADUAL DEATH. Our Yesterday is dead; our Morrow dies; This hour is pining, and the breath we draw So carelessly, our souls may waft—to where? Our ages are but periodic tombs Of those that went before: for childhood seems The death of infancy; and childhood dies When youth commences, which itself departs In daring manhood; then old age begins, Whose wrinkle deepens into manhood's grave: Thus death is imaged by our very life! And hope and pleasure, feeling, action, fame, Have each their sepulchre: our visions melt To dimness in Reality's chill tomb; Creation's self a burning death must die, And in eternity shall Time expire! STREET FUNERAL. And o'er the laughing holiday of life When men are cheerful as the dancing beam How often death's terrific darkness frowns! See! where they come, the black-robed funeral train, Solemn as silent thunder-clouds athwart The noon-day sky: from heaven a radiance dies The flowing pall with hues of mocking light; Around Life moves his mighty throng, and deep The death-bells wail along the ebbing air: But one poor week hath vanish'd,—and that form, Now clay-cold in the narrow coffin stretch'd, Stalk'd o'er the street which takes him to his tomb! On with the mourning train!—the crowd divide Before them with a busy hum, then close Behind, like billows by a prow dispersed That sever but to clash and roar again! ANGEL OF DEATH. Angel of Darkness! out of hell evoked, With dread the bosom of Creation thrill'd When fell thy shadow over Eden's bower, Whose beauty wither'd like the spirit's bloom When the rich breath of young affection dies. Look back! appall'd Imagination! gaze Thine eye to dimness, o'er the track of time Scathed by his fury! mark the demonwing'd, 'Tis Death! the Uncontrollable! his flight Begins, whose path wears Desolation's smile! And how eternity its gate unbars To let them in, those fleet and countless dead, While myriads melt and vanish, like the gleams That flash from fever's eye!— HIS TRIUMPH. Thy spell hath work'd, Thou King of woes! thy wand hath been obey'd; Destruction saw it, and Her deeds reply! The sea hath buried in her floating tomb, The fire devour'd, the blighting pest consumed, The rocking earthquake into atoms crush'd, And conflagration, havoc, siege, and war, And malady which like a fiend-breath acts, Have martyr'd,—what an unimagined host Since the first grave for Adam's corpse unclosed! And, oh, let mother, maid, and orphan tell, Let parent, friend, whate'er affection clasps Or sweet relationship of soul implies,— How tears have rain'd from lids that watch'd and wept As each beloved one, like a featured Shade Melted in mute eternity! For Death Hath cull'd his victims from the choicest bowers And gardens of Existence: fair as bright And pure as paradise before the Fall Have babes departed, ere one smiling look Hath travers'd earth, or seen the life of things: And voiceless as the uncomplaining dews That wither on the dusky cheek of Night, The silent victims of the heart's decay Have perish'd! while within the dart was fix'd And rankling; not a sigh their secret told: For pure and proud, and delicate as light Their being faded: 'twas the blight of soul, The mildew of the mind, that check'd and chill'd Their health of spirit: friend and parent yearn'd Around them, wondering where the venom lurk'd Which thus with cruel stealth defaced and marr'd That earth-born seraph, Beauty robed for heaven! But still they faded with a calm decline Serene as twilight; leaving early death A lovely secret, by th' Almighty known. DEATH'S PROGRESS. What is the Past?—The sepulchre of time Where lies the dust which once form'd living man. By thousands oft, or one by one, decay Hath reap'd mankind for thy dread harvest, Death! Thus in the forest, where a leafy host Hangs on the mercy of autumnal winds In withering tremor, when a howling gust Havocs the branches, throngs of leaves descend Countless and quick as human glances fall; But when the air is tranced, with thrilling tone A leaflet drops,—how awfully distinct! To him whose moralising dream surveys A hue of death on each consumptive bough. DEATH HAS NO HISTORIAN. And Thou! pale Chronicler of perish'd years, Whose page is studded with the dyes of sin And blood, or brighten'd with deceptive gleams Of miscall'd glory, what can thy dark book Of History teach?—but half what Truth has been! The heat, the struggle, the majestic toils Of high contention, which colossal Minds Exhibit on the stage of human dreams, By thee are traced with emulative glow; But hadst Thou, by omniscient aid inspired, The dread instruction from each dying lip Recorded,—what a page for conscience thine! A thrilling sermon for the soul to read Whose text would be, eternity unveil'd! IDEAL VIEWS. Around thee, for awhile, the den recal, The shore, the blood, the battle-wasted fields, The dungeon, rock, or sickly chamber dim Where nature gasp'd or groan'd its last farewell! From death-beds back the curtain draw, and see How Clay and Spirit to the last contend. Advance, and view a haughty sinner die! Behold the brow where thought satanic reign'd, The glance which threaten'd to appal the tomb, The hand whose motion made a tempest rise In hearts and empires!—hark! the voice That once created valour by its sound, How fruitless all, how infantile and vain! He dies, as underneath our foot the dews, Gone at a touch of death! Or mark the bed Where he whose spirit had his God unthroned, Annihilated Heaven, Hereafter mock'd, And call'd the world a fatherless Unknown, Lies wild and restless as the moaning wave: His guilt hath set eternity on fire And shuddering, like a shrivell'd leaf,—he dies! DYING SAINTS. But Death has often been by faith uncrown'd And daunted, till dis dim and icy gaze Forewent its terror; and his summons rang Like fairy preludes from seraphic lyres Heaven-wafted, on the parting Spirit's ear. And if that Volume, where pure Angels keep A soul's bright history, could unfolded be, Pilgrims of earth! who seek the better land, How would ye burn with apostolic love And in the ashes of the tomb discern A Spark immortal, kindling for the skies What adorations, warm as incense-fire, What bursts of faith, what notes of speechless joy, What gleams of Christ in glorified array, What tones and tears of overwhelming love Around the couch of dying virtue throng'd Ere rushed the spirit from its house of clay! Oh! beautiful beyond depicting words To paint, the hour that wafts to heaven a soul! The world grows dim; the scenes of time depart; The hour of peace, the walk of social joy, The mild companion, and the deep-soul'd friend, The loved and lovely, see his face no more: The mingling spell of sun, of sea, and air, Is broken; voice, and gaze, and smiles which speak, Must perish; parents take their hush'd adieu; A wife, a child, a daughter half divine Or son which never drew a father's tear, Approach him, and his dying tones receive In God's own language!—'tis an hour of awe Yet terrorless, when revelations flow From faith immortal; view that pale-worn Brow, It gleams with glory! in his eye there dawns A dazzling earnest of unutter'd joy: Each pang subdued, his longing soul respires The gales of glorified eternity; And round him, hues ethereal, harps of light, And lineaments of earthless beauty throng, As, wing'd on melody, the saint departs While Heaven in miniature before him shines. DEATH NEVER PAUSES. The thought how dread, that not a moment fleets But with it many a soul hath sunk away To that untraced Abyss, within whose womb Six thousand Years have buried all they bore! Yes, while around unvalued pleasures throng In the soft atmosphere of human smiles We play with time, as infants do with toys, And rarely think, how Death is heaping fast The new-dug graves; exulting o'er a wreck; Or counting victims from the corpse-strewn sea, Or laughing where the thunder-bolt has dash'd Some lord of earth to nothing! Then the flood And blast, the conflagration dire, disease And danger, death-bed horrors, broken hearts, And exiles in their damp-wall'd dungeons chain'd,— Oh! each and all would melt a moral tear If known or felt, from Pleasure's sated eye. Then come, poetic Spirit! plume thy strength, Thy wings expand, Imagination, wake! Traverse the troubled world from shore to shore, That with a panoramic glance my soul May vision forth dark tragedies of Death! STORM. Listen! for, hear ye not the startled Winds Invisibly are coming from their caves? Fierce as avenging fiends from hell evoked, They march, and madden with a mingled howl; Creation shudders at the waking Storm, Or darkens, by prophetic tremors thrill'd. Again, again, the congregated Winds Unroll their voices! they have roused the Sea, And on her back ten thousand thousand waves Like wings of wrath are swelling as they rise! Above, the rocky clouds are wildly clash'd, Till darkness quickens into light! and fierce And far, as though the universe obey'd, Monarch of sound, the Thunder's mandate rings Rattling the heavens with long-repeated roar! While ever and anon pale lightnings gleam And flash like armoury of waving fire: SHIPWRECK. Alone upon the leaping billows, lo! What fearful Image works its way? A ship, Shapeless and wild, as by the Storm begot; Her sails dishevell'd, and her massy form Disfigured, yet tremendously sublime: Prowless and helmless through the waves she rocks, And writhes, as if in drowning agony: Like valour when amid o'erwhelming foes The vessel combats with the battling waves, Then fiercely dives below:—the Thunders roll A requiem, and the Whirlwinds howl for joy. THE CREW. And where are they, who from the breezy deck Beheld the sun in orient glory rise Like a divinity, and breathed a prayer O'er the fresh promise of a placid sea? Float they in lifeless masses through the deep? Look! where a flash of lightning stripes the sea, Like straw upon the wind a bark is whirl'd From wave to wave: within, a pale-faced crew Sit dumb as phantoms; with their eyes bedimm'd, Their locks foam-sprinkled, and their lips unclosed; And when the clouds their fires unsheath, against The wizard glare their upturn'd faces gleam In one despairing row! Their doom is seal'd Above: Death howls in every wolfish blast And rides on each gigantic wave: the sea Their sepulchre shall make; their coffins be Her caves, until the summon'd Ocean hear The death-trump, and her tombless dead arise. CALM AND LANDSCAPE. Wave, wind, and thunder have departed: shrunk The vision'd ocean from our mental view, And lo! a landscape, green as Painting loves, Or sunshine veil'd when Milton's spirit-gaze Saw Paradise around him wave her flowers While glorious Adam with his Maker walk'd, Or Eve her shadow on the lake admired. On yonder vernal mead, a cherub boy Is bounding, playful as a breeze new-born, Light as the beam which dances by his side. Phantom of Beauty! with his golden locks Gleaming like water-wreaths,—a flower of Life To whom the fairy world is fresh, the sky A glory, and the Earth one huge delight! His brow makes joy; his eyes are Pleasure's own; While Innocence, from out the budding lip Darts her young smiles along his rounded cheek: Grief hath not dimm'd the brightness of his form; Love and affection o'er him spread their wings, And Nature, like a nurse, with sweetest look Her child attends. The humming bee will bound From out the flower, nor sting his baby-hand; The birds address him from the blossom'd trees, And suppliantly the fierce-eyed mastiff fawn, Come when he may, to court his playful touch. INFANCY. To rise all rosy from the arms of Sleep, And, like the sky-bird, hail the bright-cheek'd Morn With trills of song; then o'er the cowslipp'd mead The blue-wing'd butterfly to chase, or play With curly streams; or, led by watchful Love, Admire the chorus of the trooping waves, When the young breezes laugh them into life; Or listen to the mimic ocean-roar That waves have buried in a sea-shell's depth; From sight and sound to catch intense delight And frolic meaning from each happy face,— Make his fond round of infantile romance. And when at length dejected Evening comes Joy-worn he nestles in the welcome couch With kisses warm upon his cheek, of heaven To dream, till morning wakes him to the world. THE DEAD INFANT. Into a curtain'd room the Scene hath changed, Where a wan semblance of the mournful sun Lies dreaming on the walls. Dim-eyed and sad, And dumb with agony, two parents bend O'er a pale Image in a coffin laid, More exquisite than Death in marble looks,— Their infant once, the laughing, leaping boy, The bud of life, the nursling of their souls! Pain touch'd him, and the life-glow fled away Swift as a gay hour's fancy: fresh and cold As Winter's shadow, with his eyelids seal'd Like violet lips at eve, he lies enrobed An offering for the Grave; but, bright and pure The infant martyr hath to heaven been call'd, Lisping soft hallelujahs with the choir Of sinless babes, imparadised above. CHURCHYARD. A glimmering churchyard, heap'd with countless graves Like hosts of billows couch'd upon the deep, Dawns into vision now. The dormant air Is hush'd, and on that rich-leaf'd file of elms, The choral wind hath sung itself to sleep. And here, where Meditation loves to dream While noon a burning stillness breathes around, From out yon mouldering cells let Fancy cite A heart-wreck'd Being, whom the savage world Deserted, and repentance wore to death. BETRAYED AFFECTION. In beauty moulded like a shape of love From the damp earth behold her meekly rise, As delicate as when the worshipp'd form Bade Envy stand abash'd, while youth and grace Round her fair mien a faultless magic threw. Light of her home, impassion'd forth she came And where she moved a thousand Hearts were drawn! But he who won her warm in virgin-truth, Belied his homage and betray'd her trust; Then, like a haunted tomb the erring maid By the cold World was shunn'd, nor found one spot Of shelter, from th' accusing eye of Scorn: Till far away, from all her scene of wo The unlamented mourner came, with griefs Like thunder-scars upon her soul engraved! SECLUSION AND DEJECTION. In a lone hamlet all retired she dwelt In meekness and remorse: but Sorrow taught Her kindliness to bloom; and by the Poor A heaven-born Lady was she rightly deem'd, Whose smile made every peasant-cottage bright And took from Poverty the sting of shame. Among the hermit-walks, and ancient woods When mantled with the melancholy glow Of eve, she wander'd oft; and when the wind Like a stray infant down autumnal dales Roam'd wailingly, she loved to mourn and muse; To commune with the lonely orphan-flowers And through sweet nature's ruin trace her own. PARTING HOUR. But through the quiet churchyard's elmy range Unwatch'd she loved to roam; and there was seen Like a pale Statue o'er some weed-grown tomb To bend, and look as if she wept the dead; And when the day-gleam faded o'er far hills She gazed with such deep look, as Love would mark Some parting smile, to treasure it when gone! But when the yellow moonlight clad the air, How from the window she the heavens would watch, Till in her eye an adoration shone: Sad Lady! then her thoughts in tears arose And every tear ran burning from her heart! Thus day by day her unpartaken grief Was nursed, till sorrow grew a sleepless fire That parch'd her soul. One evening while she mused, And from her lattice read that starry lore Which mourning Fancy half believes, her face Grew lily-white; a languid murmur came; Her head hung drooping like a laden flower, And soft as sound her spirit fled to heaven! YOUTHFUL GENIUS. Upon the mountain, with Thy hectic cheek And soul outlooking from the lifted eye As if the beauty of some thought were seen, Why, who art Thou, undaunted by the storm In rolling anthems round thee gather'd? Clouds Swell back; and underneath wild Ocean roars As though her waves were all to whirlpools lash'd: Yet canopied with thunder, there thou stand'st Till feeling like a storm of music wakes And trembles through thy being! Art thou there A Spirit tempest-born, and on the rock Enthroned, to parley with the thunder-peals? INSPIRATIONS. Thou wert not moulded for the selfish world; Too lofty and too full of heavenly fire E'er to be measured by ungifted minds Whom Glory hath not raised. Ambition rock'd Thy cradle; Genius all thine infant soul Etherealised, and in the rich-orb'd eye The rays of thought and inspiration pour'd: Before the tongue a budding thought reveal'd Imagination dallied with thy mind, And sent it playing through her airy realms: But when the man upon thy forehead beam'd, Impassioned Creature! then thy race began: Feelings of beauty and of rich delight Flow'd from the countenance of this fair Earth Full on thy soul, wherein a second world Was shrined: for thee inspiring Nature glow'd, And warm'd thy fancy like a dream from heaven. Thou lov'st her mightiness, her glorious mien! Whether she loose her ocean-zone, and let The waves abroad, or hang the sky with storms, Or hail thee in her thunders; or at eve When sunshine like a beauteous memory dies And the breeze anthems like a bird of air, Call thee to witness, how in deck'd array The marshall'd clouds attend th' imperial Sun Before his throne of waves,—alike divine She seems. And not alone does Nature charm Thy senses into wondering awe; but all Which men admire, by genius or by art Created, bids thy soul with homage swells; Rich music, like a warbling seraph, flings Entrancement round thee, till emotions melt As yielding darkness when by light subdued; A living picture, like a passion pours Delight into thine eye; and Poesy,— Is stamp'd thy mind, and colours all thy thoughts! To have thy glory on the chart of Time Recorded, mapp'd in deep and dazzling lines, And thus be deathless in the fame the power And offspring of creative soul; to build A monument of Mind, on which the good May gaze, while future Ages round it bend With homage nobler than a king commands,— Desire so godlike is for ever warm And panting in thy breast; and oft, methinks, When darkness like the death of light begins Beneath the lone magnificence of heaven, While planets glow oracularly bright, Ambition dreams, and Hope the charmer smiles! PENALTIES AND PAINS. But, oh! thou Victim of a mental curse, The fire and fever of the soul are thine Which burn within, like Desolation's breath! Body and mind, before they bloom, decay; And ere upon the rock of high renown The banner of thy fame exulting waves Lost in the tomb thy buried hopes will lie And o'er thy name Oblivion's pall descend! The path to glory is a path of death To feeling hearts, all gifted though they be And martyrs to the Genius they adore: The wear of passion, and the waste of thought, The glow of inspiration, and the gloom That like a night-shade mars the brightest hour, And that fierce rack on which a faithless World Will make thee writhe—all these ennerving pangs, With agonies which mock the might of words, Thou canst not bear: thy temple is a tomb! PESTILENCE. The Scene hath vanish'd! swelling like a mist From out a marshy vale at morn, behold! A City, dimly-vision'd: on the view It grows, till full in vast perfection seen. There all is mute and motionless; no spires Hallow the air with heavenly chime; no flags Or banners shiver in the suppling breeze; No eager steps sound pattering through the streets; No life seems in it,—silent as a shade! Look up! the sickly clouds like corpses lie Along the heavens; and yonder dark canal Flags like a monstrous serpent stretch'd in death; The houses shed a monumental gloom: The Pestilence is there! CITY OF THE PLAGUE. Young Morn beheld A beauteous City, with the floods of life Billowing loudly through her million paths: Her Temples bathed their heads in azure sheen; Her rivers spread themselves along in joy; The spirit of the world within her walls Inspiring walk'd; by noon the sun grew red And glared his fierceness through the sky, till forth From out the lurid deeps of heaven, the Plague Her breath exhaled, that with a viewless spread Itself suffused through all the living town, Which, sudden as an ocean chained, grew dumb! The old man faded like a blasted tree, And dropp'd into the dust! and he whose cheeks Were round and fair, with eyes of lustrous youth, From beauty wither'd to a yellow wreck Distorted and decay'd, till Madness came, And shrieking, shuddering, writhed herself to death! Along each river crept the Plague; then hush'd The grinding cables! and the barges lay Like dead sea-monsters on the ocean stretch'd; E'en on the mead with emerald verdure clad, Where the gay urchin drove the whirling ball Fleet as a bird along the sunny air, The Pestilence her burning vapour breathed; Each limb relax'd, upturn'd his darken'd lids, And from his ghastly eyeballs glared the Pest! From house to house the hot infection stole; To gloom all gladness changed, and not a smile In the whole city lived! Within the fane Amid the pillar'd aisle, while lowly knelt In all the holiness of virgin love The fair-zoned bride of Beauty, came the Pest! She coil'd, and shiver'd like a wounded dove; Her form grew wild; and as the bridegroom watch'd The heaven reflected from her face depart, Contagion clasp'd him in her fiery arms, His spirit whirl'd within him, and he fell And o'er his loved one yelled his life away! But in the tomb-fill'd churchyard, what a howl From the parch'd throats of mourners came! for there The graves were brimm'd with corses; and around Unburied dead lay blackening in the air, While Shades of being stagger'd by the heaps Of friends and relatives together piled: Such was the revelry of horrid Death; And when at last by God himself recall'd, The Sun of health arose, his eye beheld Yon City hush'd as one enormous tomb! MOONLIGHT SCENE. Turn to a vision of contrasted joy: Ne'er since creation out of chaos roll'd With the mild bloom of young existence fresh Around it, hath more glorious night bedecked The World, than that which beautifies her now. The stars like ruminating spirits walk The mellow sky, from whence the queenly moon With a maternal aspect eyes the earth, Tranced into dreamy stillness by her smile. No! not a breeze, nor bird is on the wing; The shy sweet flowers have shut their dewy lids, And distant trees, upon the dark-brow'd hills, Like shadowy sentinels are ranged. And now The reign of heart-romance! the lulling hour When aspirations from the mystic heaven Effused, the high-toned mind awake with thoughts Which angels love: but see! beneath Yon hill, down where the wrinkled brooklets flash In liquid revelry, the silver'd Deep Lies bare unto the moon; and on her breast, In swan-like glory, glides a white-wing'd boat Calm as a cloud along its blue career. LOVERS. Within, like Beings from a purer sphere A youth and his confiding maiden sit, Her yielding waist environ'd with his arm: Above them, beautiful the starry dome! Beneath, the sighing of romantic waves Woke from their slumber, or melodious heave Of tide, the panting of the World's great heart— Breaks on the pleasing calm: oh, lovely pair! Warm is the gush of young affection; sweet The overflowing of affianced hearts Each into each with holy rapture pour'd; Now is the spring-time of the soul, whose bloom Is love, but once ne'er felt, and ne'er but once Enjoy'd! On would ye float for ever thus O'er moonlight seas, in one immortal bliss— Silence! the language of delighted hearts. CONSUMPTION. And hast thou, Curse of the primeval crime! On one of these Thy vulture-glances fixed? Shall knells of death moan heavy on the wind When marriage peals should merrily resound In tuneful rapture o'er the village spire? Alas! for every age Death finds a grave, And youthful forms as oft as hoary heads Are pillow'd there. Thou loved and loving One! From the dark languish of thy liquid eye So exquisitely rounded, darts a ray Of truth, prophetic of thine early doom; And on thy placid cheek there is a flush Of Death,—the beauty of Consumption there! Few note that fatal bloom; for bless'd by all Thou movest through thy noiseless sphere, the life Of one,—the darling of a myriad hearts! Yet in thy chamber, o'er some graceful task When delicately bending, oft unseen Thy mother looks with telescopic glance Down the dim world of Time, and sees thee robed A pallid martyr, shrouded for the tomb! THE LOVED ONE DIES. A year hath travell'd to eternity; And now, the shadows of the grave grow dark Upon the maiden; yet no fruitless wish Or word abrupt, unlovely thoughts betrays Of gloom and discontent within; she fades As gently as the flower declines,—not false To living claims, and yet for death prepared. Beautiful resignation, and the hopes From the rich fountain of her faith derived, Around her a seraphic air have breathed Of wither'd loveliness. The gloss of life And worldly dreams are o'er; but dewy Morn, And dim-eyed Eve, and all the mental gleams Of rapture, darted from regretted joys, Delight her still; and oft when Twilight comes, She gazes on the damask glow of heaven With all the truth of happier days, until A sunny fancy wreathes her faded cheek; 'Tis but a pleasing echo of the Past, A music rolling from remember'd hours! The day is come, by Death led gently on; With pillow'd head all gracefully reclined And glossy curls in languid clusters wreath'd, Within a cottage-room she sits to die: Where from the window, in a western view, Majestic Ocean rolls. A summer-eve Veils the calm earth, and all the glowing air Stirs faintly, like a pulse; against the shore The waves advance with undulating joy, While o'er the midway-deep her eye-glance roams, Where like a sea-god glares the travell'd Sun O'er troops of billows marching in his beam. From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth her eyes Are lifted, bright with wonder and with awe, Till through each vein reanimation rolls!— 'Tis past; and now her filmy glance is fix'd On the rich heavens, as though her spirit gazed On that immortal World, to which 'tis bound: But sunset, like a burning palace fades, In hues of visionary pomp destroy'd; And Day and Beauty have together died: For there like sculptured Death the maiden lies, More exquisite than Love's embodied dream! WAR. The smoke, the thunder, and the din of War! Loud as an ocean leaping into life I hear the storm of battle swell. Advance; And listen to the cloud-ascending peals Of Cannon, from whose lips a lightning glares! Hark! how the bugle-echoes beat the air, And how the deep-roll'd drums their wrath resound, While on the throbbing Earth the Sun looks down Like a dread war-fiend, with a fierce delight. Death! here thou art; and here the flashing swords Shall reap thy harvest, and devoted souls By thousands rush into the hands of God! FIELD OF DEATH. Noon into eve, and eve to night hath roll'd; The heavens with starry eyes are set: but, see! No wafted banners, flapping like the wings Of eagles in their glorious strength; no steeds Pawing and prancing with erected manes; No warriors hand to hand; no sword to sword Confronted, till from out some bloody gap Their spirits bound into eternity!— But heaps of corses, lines of dead laid out, Unhelmeted, or gash'd and gory; men Whose morning-beauty shamed the risen sun, With glassy eyeballs gleaming on the moon! A living host hath deaden'd into clay:— No more! away, O Death! and count thy dead. THE CAPTIVE. Now from the hoof-worn plains of war, where blood Makes glory, to a scene of stagnant gloom Avert thy fancy. Lo, a dungeon, roof'd By one erected arch of blacken'd stone; 'Tis Freedom's tomb! The all-reviving air Of heaven those mildew'd walls has never fann'd, The light hath shed no lustrous beauty there; But shade, and damp night-breath, and noisome slime Traced o'er its rocky vault, the clank of chains, With groans from wasted lungs exhaled, the laugh Of lean-faced Madness, and the fitful moan Of iron'd captives,—these have horrified This den of Darkness. Look! a ray of eve Hath wander'd to it through a narrow chink, And stealthily it creeps along the wall Then quivers, like a smile upon the cheek Of what has been,—a miniature of God! A free-born, free-bred spirit, bright and brave, Who loved the mountains and the sea adored, And call'd the wind a song of Liberty As loud it warbled o'er his fearless head! By Pagans captured, here the chains have gall'd, And rusted on his limbs; long years roll'd by And yet he gnash'd in fetters, till the flame Of anguish burn'd his being up; he died,— With home and country pictured on his heart! That den within he was not tomb'd alone: For twice ten years another captive wretch Had withered there; but long ere that, the soul Was quench'd, and Madness in her mightier wo Forgot to weep o'er thraldom! Mark them both; The one like marble on the earth reposed In rigid silence, coffinless and cold; The other madly glaring o'er him: see! How oft he twines the matted locks, and hoots With idiotic joy, then grinds his teeth And leers around him with a dumb delight, And babbles to the corse, till on his face A ray of pity dawns; then down he kneels And howls a dirge, till voice within him dies; His head droops o'er him; dimly rolls the eye, And the last life-breath gurgles in his throat; 'Tis o'er: and Heaven hath open'd on his soul! THE METROPOLIS AND DEATH. The grand arena, where insatiate Death Drags every day his hundreds to the tomb, London the huge, earth's capital and queen, In dim array magnificently spread Towers into vision now! not sending forth The hum and clamour of her myriad streets, Made awful by the roar of life; but stretch'd In mute immensity beneath a sky Of midnight, breathless with the summer glow. And now, within their curtain'd chambers lie What hosts of beings, of all age and clime! Some laugh in dreams; and some with laden hearts Mutter strange secrets; others quake and groan, And kindle darkness with a torch of hell! Now steals the murderer from his den; now hies The robber to his haunt; and from their lanes And unfrequented walks the haggard Shapes Of Poverty and Crime come creeping forth Like Spectres, crawling out of dusky tombs. The heavens are visor'd; hark! the dreary how! Of Thunder challenging the Night; or like An unseen monster, moaning as he prowls: Awhile 'tis hush'd; then flash the riven clouds Asunder, and a lake of lightning gleams Like shining water through the cloven dark, While rain-drops hiss along the sultry air. THE DESERTED ONE. Wo to the houseless wanderer! doom'd to walk Through the drench'd street barefooted, or bereft Of life's sweet charities, at such an hour: And yet, e'en such a martyr Anguish owns! For down yon lane of gloom, upon the cold And dripping steps, with garments moistly clung Round her shrunk form, a lifeless woman lies With face upturn'd unto the flooding shower. The chain of life despair hath just unlink'd; And on her cheek an agonising trace Of parting spirit, as it work'd and writhed And with the body wrestled, still remains. Approach! and with the lamp-beam learn her fate, In mournful lines upon her visage mapp'd: A chronicle of sorrow and of sin And shame whose fountain is a brain of fire; A heart for ever on the rack of care; Oppression from without, and pangs within; Despair, then death, the master-cure of wo, Survey her features, and you read them all! Unhappy maiden! round whose days of bloom A father's prayers their holy influence cast, And from whose eyes a mother reap'd delight, Death should have torn thee earlier to the tomb, And in thy native churchyard heap'd thy grave Of grassy mould: for once, along the mead Fleet as the fawn thou boundest; bright and fair The beauty of the valleys o'er thy form And features breathed, while in each glance there shone The magic of an uncorrupted mind: And this is all that now of thee remains!— In Heaven's dread book thy sorrow hath a page, And when 'tis open'd, who shall quail the most, The man who tempted, or the maid who fell? THE UNDESCRIBED. These fearful visions of thy varied power Appalling Death! with dreader ones compared, Reflect a shadow of thy murderous sway,— Thy ceaseless havoc through the realms of Life. Let others paint thee on the desert-heath Where, melting into blood, with lukewarm limbs A gory wretch lies gasping and alone; Or in the roofless and deserted homes, Where fires have blacken'd on the blister'd walls; Or in the Suicide,—lo! where he stands With visage colourless, with look aghast And spirit shivering through his guilty frame! DEATH'S UNIVERSAL REIGN. Yes! far or near, where'er the life-blood flows, By ruin, violence, or calm decay Death's ravages are felt: the very dust That in our daily walks we tread, hath once Some breathing mould of Beauty been. O earth! Thou grave, and mother! in thy hollow breast What faded myriads are entomb'd! Your dead Give back, departed Ages, and arise Ye spirits of the Past!—they come, they come! From mountain and from cave, from vault and tomb The Dead are darting into life again! The generations that have been, from Earth's Young dawn, to moments on their very wing Behold them! sumless as the ocean sand; A world of Life walks o'er a world of Death; Till all are buried in one deep Abyss, The tomb of passion, prejudice, and time! WHAT ALL HAVE FELT. To die, is Nature's universal doom; The Past hath braved it, and the Future shall; Though little deem we, as we laugh the hours Along like echoes dandled by the wind, How swift our path is verging to the grave. Terrific Power! how often in the hush Of midnight, when the thoughtless learn to think, The gay grow solemn, and the foolish wise, Visions of thee come floating o'er the mind Like exhalations from a grave! How oft We feel an awfulness the soul o'ershade As if 'twere soaring to the throne of God, Till in one thought of heaven we bury all The breathing universe of life and man! HUMAN FATE. A death-cloud rises with the star of Life; And ere upon the world our hearts expand, Like flower-buds opening to the kiss of Morn, With gay and guiltless love, the voice of doom Awakes; this sermon from the grave is preach'd; We live to die, and die again to live A spirit-life in unimagined worlds! First, Infancy, whose days are prattling dreams; Next, Childhood, crown'd with beauty, health, and joy,— Those wizard three, which make the mind like spring, The breath, the bloom and sunshine of the soul;— Then, Manhood, most majestic; through the heavens Piercing with haughty eye, and printing earth With kingly steps; ambition, love, and care, And energy, in wild and restless play For ever heaving like a wave of fire; And then comes passionless and feeble Age That droops and drops into the silent grave! Here ends the scene of life; one moment wept, The next forgotten; let the curtain fall, Oblivion has our tale,—we lived, and died! PAST AND FUTURE. Thousands of years beneath thy sway have groan'd Unwearied Death! how many more shall bear The burden of the curse, no human tongue Can tell, for they are chronicled above; Though ofttimes number'd by a guilty mind When thunders, like dread oracles, the world Awake. Yet, come it will, however late, That day foretold when Death himself shall die! And generations, now but dust and worms, Rise into being with an angel-shout And on the winds of glory soar to heaven! PREPARATION. And yet, though Life enchant, and Death appal, How gently does the hand of Time unloose Those many links which chain us to the world! The passions which inspirit youthful hearts And spread a lustre o'er the brow of life And bid the hopes of young Ambition bound, Decay and cool, as further down the vale Of twilight-years we wend, till, all resign'd, The time-worn spirit ponders o'er the tomb With elevating sadness; and the night Of death is lit with those immortal stars By Revelation sphered in heaven. How pure The grace, the gentleness, of virtuous Age! Though solemn, not austere; though wisely dead To passion, and the wildering dreams of hope, Not un-alive to tenderness and truth, The good old Man is honour'd and revered, And breathes upon the young-limb'd race around A grey and venerable charm of years. ALLEVIATIONS. And, glory to the Power which brings the heart In sympathy with Time! how much remains In the pure freshness of ideal life, For him who loves the bloom of Days no more! A meditative walk by wood or mead, The lull of streams, and language of the stars Heard in the heart alone; an inward view Of all which beautified or graced his youth, Is yet enjoy'd; and with that bliss are found The feelings flowing from a better World. SPIRITUAL TRIUMPH. Then, melt, ye horrors! which the grave begets, And turn to glory, by the spell of faith Transform'd; for Christ hath overcome the tomb.— What though 'tis awful, when the pulse of Life Is bounding, and the blood seems liquid joy; To look Corruption in its ghastly face, The mind is Man! no sepulchre for souls Can dust and darkness frame; like God apart In calm eternity they act and think: The shroud, the hearse, the life-alarming knell, The grave's cold silence, and the vision'd friends Whose dreams will hover round our chill decay, Harrow our living dust, and give to Death A sting that dwells not in his own dark power. We die in body, but in soul we live, When flesh and spirit sunder; then our chains Are riven, and celestial freedom dawns! The fetter'd eagle whom a narrow cage Imprison'd, where so oft his haughty wings In wild unrest have beat his hated walls With blood-stain'd plumage, while his eyeballs glared Proudly along the blue and boundless sky Above him,—free and fetterless at last On plumes of ecstasy can soar away And mount, and mingle with the heaven he loves! RETROSPECTIONS. Of Death I sing; yet soon may darkly sleep And press the pillow of the dreamless grave Forgetting and forgot! But twenty years Have wither'd, since my pilgrimage began, And I look back upon my boyish days With mournful joy; as musing wanderers do With eye reverted from some lofty hill Upon the bright and peaceful vale below. Oh! let me live, until the fires which feed My soul, have work'd themselves away, and then Eternal Spirit! take me to Thy home: For when a child, inspiring dreams I shaped, And nourish'd aspirations that awoke Beautiful feelings, flowing from the face Of Nature; from a child I learn'd to reap A harvest of sweet thoughts for future years. How oft, be witness, Guardian of our days! In noons of young delight, while o'er the down Humming like bees my happy playmates fled, I loved on high and hoary crag to muse And thread the landscape with delighted eye: The sky besprinkled o'er with rainbow-hues, As if angelic wings had wanton'd there; The distant City capp'd with hazy towers; And river, shyly roaming by its banks Of green repose, together with the play Of elfin-music on the fresh-wing'd air,— With these entranced, how often have I glow'd With thoughts which panted to be eloquent, Yet only ventured forth in tears! PARTING THOUGHTS. And now Though haply mellow'd by correcting time, I thank thee, Heaven! that this bereaving World Hath not diminish'd the undaunted hopes Of youth, in manhood's more imposing cares. Nor titled pomp, nor princely mansions swell The cloud of envy o'er my heart; for these Are oft delusive, though adored: but when The Holy and the Beautiful from God Descend into my being; when I hear The oracles which from Creation-shrines, Roll their deep melody round listening hearts; Or gaze on Virtue, till her glory seems Emmanuel's shadow by a Saint expressed; Then feel I envy for immortal words, And the full pulse of Poetry begins To waken in me, with exulting throb No language echoes! then the spirit yearns To dash my feelings into deathless verse Which may administer to Time unborn, And tell some lofty Soul, how I have lived A worshipper of Nature, and of Thee. A VISION OF HEAVEN. A FRAGMENT. —1829. “The heavens were opened, and I saw visions.” Ezekiel i. 1. “Juvat, quandoque in animo, tanquam in tabula, majoris et melioris mundi imaginem contemplari: ne mens assuefacta hodiernæ vitæ minutiis se contrahat nimis, et tota subsidat in pusillas cogitationes.” —T. Burnet. One summer-evening, from the molten sky When radiance came to beautify the world, By Fancy led, along a noiseless vale I roam'd, and trod the earth with deep delight, Felt in the soul, and in the eye reveal'd. 'Twas one of those immortal hours, when man Unheedful of the jarring world, feels thoughts Within him too sublime for words; a sense Of that divinity o'er all which breathes, Making creation one vast temple seem, Where shadows of His glory are enshrined. Thus felt I at this balmy hour: Above Magnificently hung the dome of heaven; Along the concave floated fairy isles; And where the sun stood burning on the brim Of ocean, the horizon wound its curve Festoon'd with clouds of beauty, fresh and white As sea-foam in the sun. Beneath the span Of heaven, the Earth lay languishing in light; Her streamlets with a bee-like murmur ran, And while the trees, like living creatures waved Their plumage on the wind, the bird and breeze Together hymn'd, and harmonised the air. Pensive, awhile along the placid vale I roam'd, then sat delighted on a mound Green-tress'd, and glittering in the dizzy rays Of eve, and heavenward turn'd my musing eye. Who ever gazed on heaven, nor dream'd of God, Of human destiny, and things divine? Oh that mine eye could pierce yon azure cope!— Thus stirr'd the daring thought; and while it warm'd Within, a trance like heavenly music stole Round my hush'd spirit, weaning earthly sense, Till in a vision up the airy deep It darted, as a sky-bird to the clouds! Thus disembodied, through the air it rose Till earth beneath me in a glassy depth Lay twinkling, like a star; but all around Those burning mysteries which mortals view With wonder, floating o'er the face of night, Not gems of fire, but full and perfect orbs In congregations vast, as glorious,—beam'd. Aloft! aloft! still soared my spirit on Through hosts of worlds, self-balanced and secure, Till the bright atmosphere appear'd to bloom With rich suffusion, like a topaz-glow; And here, enchanted by a spell divine My Spirit paused, became all eye and ear, And Heaven, the palace of the mighty God, Expanded into view:—Unbodied soul! With o'erawed feeling enter where He dwells. An arch'd immensity of crystal sheen Rich with the glory of all glories rare Before me lay: beneath this dazzling vault Splendour beyond the dreamings of the heart To vision, round interminably blazed: I felt, but cannot paint the magic there! While, with permitted glance, the scene I mark'd, A thrilling tide of rich-toned music roll'd, Waking delicious echoes as it wound From Melody's divinest fount. All Heaven In glorious fascination heard, and drank The tones elysian:—Silence breathed again; And where I gazed, a Throne of awful Fire Flamed ceaselessly: before it Thunders roll'd And veiling Darkness round about it hung. And here alone, in uncreated Bliss And Glory, reigns The One Eternal Power, Creator, Lord, and Life of All. Again Stillness ethereal reign'd; and forth appear'd Ecstatic Creatures, clad in robes of light, Together flocking from celestial haunts And mansions of purpureal mould; the Host Of heaven assembled, to adore with harp And hymn the First and Last, The Living God: They knelt,—an immaterial Choir, and glow'd More beauteous, while they breathed the chant divine; And Hallelujah! Hallelujah! peal'd, And thrill'd the concave with harmonious joy. The melody was hush'd; and I beheld Cherubic Forms of unimagined grace And beauty walk o'er amaranthine meads, And soar on shining pinions: as they rose, A radiance quiver'd forth, and from each plume Soft as the breeze and silky as a cloud, A gleam play'd liquidly around their path. Of archangelic mien, upon the wing Two Shapes I watch'd, careering to the bound Of vision; lighting there, they welcomed in Three happy Spirits, by The Lamb redeem'd: And Heaven they enter'd with triumphal shout; Transfigured, into glory grew, and were Beatified for ever! In a bower Remote, whose em'rald leaves with liquid drops Of light were gemm'd, two Angels next I mark'd, In sympathetic converse sat. Amid Life's wilderness below, they had o'erwatch'd The errant beings just arrived: through dark And light, through sin and toil, their guardian power Presided, until Mercy came to crown Their doom, and they were saved and seal'd for Heaven. Seraphic sweetness from their lips exhaled As, rapt with angel love, th' immortal pair Their tale of heavenly triumph told. Oh, joy! Dream'd I, around us viewless Spirits dwell; Our minds to tune, or consecrate our thoughts, And guard, relieve, and hallow souls for God. From these I turn'd, and saw a sumless host Of Cherubim, and bright pavilions rank'd In endless files; and then, Remembrance warm'd Within me; heavenly Intuition woke, And myriads who on earth erewhile had run The grand career of Life, were all reveal'd. I saw the Sages, whose immortal words Are truthful Oracles to man and mind; I saw the pure, the patriotic bands: Of Heroes, whose avenging swords had cut The fetters from their Land and bade the brave Be free! the renovated forms I saw Of Martyrs, robed with glory, on their heads Inwreathèd crowns of life; and they of old Whose names more eloquent than thunder sound On young Ambition's ear,—the good and great Of every cast and clime, were now reveal'd; The Past was in the Present born again. For sainted Bards of earth I look'd; a breath Of hymnèd music through the mellow air Came wafted, from beside a crystal fount That glitter'd like a living gush of light,— There sat our own Mæonides! Around A throng of listening Angels stood, and glow'd Till rapture trembled o'er their sunny wings, While from his lyre the epic minstrel struck Pure inspiration,—sounds replete with soul! Among the myriads of celestial Shapes Which mused and wander'd by the springs of Life, I mark'd the humble, the dejected sons Of Want and Wo, apparell'd bright as morn. On earth deem'd vile, their trampled hearts had bled With sorrows, never told; their joyless eyes With tears had melted dim; at wintry night They roam'd, and shiver'd in the bleak-wing'd wind, And often writhed beneath the glance of scorn, Yet fainted not: and now, unfading joys Beatitude and thrones in Heaven, were theirs! Fairest of all fair Visions seen above, Remember'd Thrones and unforgotten Friends Were recognised again! Along a mead Of bright immensity I saw them stray; Not anguish-worn, nor rack'd with inward fears, But shining in the beauty of the blest.— Oh! ye in life so loved, in death so mourn'd, How oft Affection through the desert-world Delights to track ye, where your feet have trod, Through fav'rite walks or fancy-haunted bowers! Blend your calm voices with the twilight breeze In fairy music, fraught with infant years? Are echoes woven from your hymns above? In solemn days and melancholy hours Of you we think! Love shrines ye in the stars, And recreates ye in celestial robes. But while at eve's poetic hour we watch The golden isles that glitter from the west, In lovelier climes ye live, and chaster skies; By choral streams and aromatic walks Ye roam, rememb'ring heaven-like bowers on earth, And friends, whose mansions ye survey above. And such was Fancy's vision-moulded heaven Around me miniatured. Here God, enthroned In measureless perfection, truth, and power, His unimaginable Glory wields: And thus Eternal Love, from Him the fount Of Love, enlightens, lives, and flows through All. No tears, no trials, and no perils known, No sin-worn hearts, and shatter'd feelings here, But calm fruition of unfailing bliss: All which the beauty of creative Thought Hath pictured to Devotion's eye, is felt Ineffably more beauteous by the Blest: Wisdom and Virtue breathe their native air And Pleasures smiling on their steps attend. Nor is the vanish'd World forgot; for oft In bowers of everlasting bloom retired, The Ransom'd, by the blood of Jesu bought, Think of the Fight their spirits fought below, Or sweetly muse o'er some terrestrial hour, While heart to heart with holy truth responds; Still Sages feed on ever-fruitful thought; And Poets sing and raptured Knowledge mounts, From step to step for ever climbing up Yet never on the radiant summit throned! Here, bliss and love Eternity embrace, And perfect Mind its perfect God adores. A VISION OF HELL. A FRAGMENT. —1829. “Where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all, but torture without end.” —Milton. No longer Death and Time remain'd: the doom Revokeless, by prophetic lips foretold, Was past; the universe had disappear'd, And Chaos revell'd o'er demolish'd worlds. Apart, upon a throne of lurid fire The Fiend was seated; in his eye there shone The look that dared Omnipotence; the light Of sateless vengeance, and sublime despair! Amid a burning world he sat, and saw Tormented myriads, whose blaspheming shrieks Were mingled with the howl of hidden floods And Acherontine groans; of all the host The only dauntless he. As o'er the wild He gazed, the pride of agony endured Awoke, and writhed through all his giant frame, That redden'd, and dilated like a sun! And then, as ever-vanish'd hours awoke The torment of wild memory, to feed The cravings of infernal wrath, he bade The roar of Hell be hush'd,—and Silence came; He call'd the cursèd, and they flash'd from cave And cell; from dungeon and from den they rose, And stood an unimaginable mass Of Spirits, agonised with burning pangs! In silence stood they, while the Demon gazed On all, and ponder'd on dead Earth and Time, From whence his vengeance such a harvest reap'd. Before him, what a congregated host Of perish'd creatures!—sumless as the waves Lash'd into life from out the wind-swept seas; Long ages gone, and they were breathing airs Of heaven, with noble attributes endow'd, Sharing the beauty of the world, and led By Mercy through the round of being; bliss And endless wo before them lay;—the doom Of guilt they braved, and barter'd Heaven for Hell! Famed Idols of the earth, around whose paths The blinding light of admiration blazed; Despots, who bathed the battle-field in blood, And many, whose immortal names had fired The page of history with a fearful glow, Were here, commingled with a nameless host. And one, among the legions of the lost, The wonder and the curse of Time! there was; The vial of almighty wrath, he held And pour'd it on the world; or, with a frown O'erclouded nations, while his fearless sword Flash'd in defiance o'er th' astounded globe! His word roll'd thunder to the haunted ear Of Kings; and Empires quail'd, as from afar The darkness of his coming deeper grew! Ambition was his God; and to o'ersway Or chain the world to his triumphal car, The demon-passion of his soul. Though Man And Nature wail'd; though Ocean storm'd, And mountains threaten'd an eternal bar, Still went he on, and battled with them all! Nor paused, till on the tower of Conquest waved The planted banner which proclaim'd him lord. No wail of widows o'er the tombless dead; No groan of orphans; nor the hideous cry Of Havoc, through the vanquish'd city howl'd, E'er deafen'd him; dominion was his heaven, Rebellion hail'd him with applausive roar, And slaughter'd millions swell'd his fame! Beside This reprobate, another ruin'd Soul Stood haughty: one of those surpassing Minds It takes a century to create! a man Whom Genius fill'd with her electric fires.— Oh! genius is a great, but fearful gift, A double portion of the God within, A talent not our own; but to entrance And elevate mankind with lofty thoughts, To shadow forth the Spirit that surrounds, Protects, adorns, and glorifies the world.— And Genius, nursed in Nature's mighty lap, For him work'd marvels. On his matchless page The vast creation lived; both when the voice Of thunder with his music roll'd; or war Of Ocean, when the deep-toned winds arose And whirl'd her into storms; or when he bade The heavens be sprinkled o'er with starry isles, Or damask'd with the crimson clouds of eve, His verse array,—magnificent the Muse Appear'd: around Her glowing form the light And breath of nature play'd. But, not to Him The Architect of all, was incense breathed; An atheistic shade his lines eclipsed: High o'er each haughty page a spirit moved More changeful than a cloud; now beaming forth Bright in the summer beauty of the soul; Then, veil'd with darkness, and infernal gloom From whence the luridness of passion glared! Yet, had he pleased, he might have hallow'd earth And human nature with immortal lines, Pure in their radiance, like prophetic gleams From heaven: but in his breast a storm there was, An anarchy of impious thoughts: he loved With minds to play, as whirlwinds do with waves. No God his genius own'd; and man was deem'd A chance-begotten shape of dust,—his doom Annihilation! Principles which nursed The soul of Ages, he would mine away, And laugh Religion from her hoary shrine. Thus sang a prostituted Muse, and taught The tongue of fools to be profanely wise: Till lo, a summons from th' Almighty came, And he was dust!—his Mind the earth appall'd; And men gazed upward on the burning sweep His genius circled o'er the heaven of fame, As though some meteor through the sky had whirl'd, And summon'd them to trace its dread career! Another of the lost, who might have lived In joy's unclouded atmosphere, was he, The Suicide—the darkest of them all! The lonely scion of an ancient line, A princely mansion, when his manhood bloom'd, Beheld him master. How augustly peer'd The turrets from the wooded park! how proud The young fawn bounded o'er the breezy knolls, And down the vales, where interwinding streams Ran musical; yet, what to him were trees With sun-smiles sparkling o'er their boughs, or song Of birds, and streams, and all the glory shed By morn and eve his hill-girt home around? No natal ties he own'd; benignant Heaven Had bless'd an ingrate; soon the stranger held His ancient halls,—the City-queen for him! Full in the prime of youth, to England's Rome He came, the meteor of his day to shine. What wonder, Admiration woo'd his eye Where'er the idol shone? Devoted friends, Delightful women and officious hearts Were his; the Capital beneath him crouch'd; And when the glorious sun of noon beheld The city roaring like a sea of life, Who shot through street and square so fiercely swift As he? How paused the many-headed Crowd, When, rolling like a distant thunder-car, His chariot darted through the smoking dust And shook the glitt'ring windows! In the park When proudly throned upon his warlike steed What eyes devour'd him with adoring looks! Thus pass'd the day; then came the midnight Mask And ball, with every splendid thief of time: To crown his course, he blighted trusting hearts, Jeer'd Honour to her face, and out of tears, The father's curse, and desolated home, A pleasure, such as Demons fancy, quaff'd. Soon fled the glories of a fatal year, And left him an unpitied wreck of pride And dissipated hours. No more the smile, Shot from the heart, flash'd o'er his happy face; No more the soul-dear friend, and sumptuous dome, Where beauty, or the banquet, witch'd the hour With languishment and love; the sun of wealth Had set, and darken'd into joyless gloom! One hope, the hope of Desperation left, He sought it, where the secret gamblers met And madden'd o'er their midnight-game. Amid The sickly glimmer of a silent room, Like Spectres, there they sat, and ventured all; Till Ruin scared them, and some faded cheek Flinch'd from the gripe of agony within! Night after night, from this infernal haunt He came, and felt the voice of Conscience rise Like hell-words sounding through his guilty soul! One night, as homeward he return'd, and heard The death-knell of another buried Day, While far o'er street and lane the waning moon A wintry radiance shed, the past arose; The frowning spectre of his murder'd Hours Appall'd the conscience! then Despair began, And in him like a living hell-spark burn'd. Awhile, in chamber'd solitude he sat, Where through the riven wall the cold blast whined And mourn'd, and rioted in rueful dreams; Till, with a laugh, deliriously he snapp'd The thread of life! and sent his spirit—where? Where are they all, who, cowards to themselves, Rob their Creator, cut existence short, And hurl their spirits back again to God, Of life disdainful, by His wisdom lent? Th' antipodes to this self-murder'd Wretch Stood by, in fellow-torment: once a man In face so meek, so honied in his tongue, A martyr to a sinful world he seem'd! What holy passion work'd his eye, as oft With woful voice, and words of heavenly tune, He sermonised, and shook his head, and sigh'd! But God unmask'd him; and he stood condemn'd, A hypocrite,—a saint without a soul! While others braved the censure of their crimes And to the world their sinful bosoms bared And sallied heedlessly to Hell, he plied His guilty pleasures in the dark, and did Unknown what millions dare, and die condemn'd: And yet, a living Sermon he appear'd; Far nearer heaven than unassuming minds Where God was templed, and his truth adored. Such was the hypocrite! and when his tomb Was piled, his epitaph Devotion read, And glow'd to think that such a man had been! By saints anointed,—yet with devils leagued. And who, among the myriads of the cursed, Was yon red Shape of unconsuming fire? A blighted Angel! Never round a soul Did fairer prospects shine: before her moved The majesty of birth, the graces breathed From polish'd mode and princely scenes. And oh! Who ever look'd upon that lovely face Where the soul sunn'd itself in smiles, or heard The prattled music of her tongue, nor dreamt She was a Seraph, born in heaven to beam! Time roll'd her years along; but with them came No saintly thoughts, which beautify the soul And tune the passions to their heavenly tone. Ne'er did the voice of pure Instruction charm Her willing ear; nor meek-eyed Wisdom stoop With fond attention to each budding word And sweet demand. Unto the dew-bright stars Her finger pointed oft; the sun and moon Were radiant wonders; and the ocean-roar Like hidden rapture, ran through every vein Until her being throbb'd with joy!—yet none Were by, to warm her wonder into praise, And stamp God's image brighter on the soul; In prayer none lock'd her little hands, or spoke Of Angels, who the growing child o'erwatch. But when, at length, the peerless woman dawn'd, Never did Mind a lovelier form create: She was a paragon, a poet's queen! The starry lustre of her speaking eyes, Her brow, her hair of fascinating curl, And neck of swan-like grace,—all seem'd divine, When with the lightness of a cloud she walk'd Her chamber, or amid the ball-room shone: The form was heavenly, but the mind of earth, A shrine for vain-born hopes, and sensual dreams, Without a thought, a sigh, or wish for Heaven! E'en to the last, when on her pain-worn cheek Approach'd the tints of death, no tender lip The coming hour reveal'd; nor in her heart Did Faith's sweet music roll: so mildly-good, In form so fair, and so adored below, Sure God would take her to his bowers of light! So dream'd Compassion's unreflecting heart And form'd a heaven, how beautifully vain! Not least deserveless of a nobler lot, Among the legions of assembled Souls Was he, the self-idolater: who made His mind a vortex for ingulphing all That worldly craft and sordid dreams inspire. To self unlink'd,—and earth a desert seem'd, A vacancy, where nothing glorious dwelt; But, to administer to mean-bred pride, His wealth augment, and lend ambition wings,— For this mankind were fool'd with base applause! For such a soul the very Devils long'd, So loveless, and with selfish dross defiled: And yet, no law he broke, no crime he dared, But in his pew devoutly pray'd; and felt The pulse of reputation, with the pride Of specious virtue: Yet, tremendous God! Before Thee, never could that Spirit stand And live; a worldling could not breathe in Heaven! When did he look upon the lofty sky Or round his temples hear the breezes hymn, And glory in his Being? When did Morn The world to re-awake arise; or Night Descend to beautify her brow with stars, And he admire them? Though the wrathful Deep Should thunder all her waves to foam; or Plagues, Like noiseless whirlwinds sweep half earth away, Still, tomb'd within himself, he would not weep, Or wonder; what to him were Nature's pranks? Not Genius, crown'd with her celestial light; Not glorious Art; nor Beauty darting out The mental radiance of her meaning eye, One noble passion in his soul could plant: No renegade was he! for when the beam Of life in death was languishing, and hell Before him sounding like a furnace-blast, A Thought look'd back, and wept the world behind! Such were a few of all the dark undone. Among them, millions who were crowned, when Time Stalk'd o'er the earth, as demigods of fame, Were seen: Philosophers, whose rebel doubts Would, Titan-like, have disenthroned The God In heaven, were here; and hosts of every shade Of sin, from visor'd Crime, to daring Vice; And those, whose coward-virtues only shone Untried, when happiness around them smiled; Unlike the truly good, whose virtues were As stars,—unnoticed in the haughty glare Of day, but in their full effulgence seen And felt, when darkness overshrouds the world. Not least in number were of middle-stamp, Nor good, nor bad, and yet for heaven too base; Triflers, who gaily pass'd from life to death Like full-wing'd vessels o'er a gallant sea! And did not meek-eyed Mercy stoop to save?— To Heaven she beckon'd every breathing soul! By day, by night, she whisper'd to the heart, “A God! Eternity! A Day of Doom!” By funeral-knells, and swiftly-dying friends; In solemn hours, and serious moods; by pangs Within, and perils from without; by all The eloquence of love and truth divine She summon'd man to glory, and be saved. In vain!—the tides of joy unebbing flow'd, And lightly tript the fairy Hours along: Eternity was all a cheat! and Heaven, Some bright creation of a poet's dream; And Hell, but burning in a priestly brain! Men died; and could they have their breath resumed, With one terrific shrick they would have thrill'd Creation round,—“There is, there is a Hell!” But now, for ever dungeon'd must they groan Where minutes hold eternities of pain! The crowns in happier realms they might have worn In mocking dreams now only view'd, which make Damnation more severe; their wasted hours, Corrupting pleasures and degraded joys, The sabbaths broken, and the God blasphemed,— All, in one blended, burning mass of sin And mem'ry, round each guilty Soul revolve, Where self-conviction forms the deepest Hell. UNIVERSAL PRAYER. Almighty, True, Eternal, and Supreme, By Person Threefold and in Nature One, Jehovah dread, adorable I Am! Through Christ alone accessibly reveal'd, In whom Thine attributes and counsels meet Become incarnate and the World redeem,— Look on our hearts, and lift them up to Thee, By prayer and praise for due ascension wing'd. Illume, expand, and purify the Soul With inward radiance, from Thyself derived; The springs of mind unlock, and let them gush Heavenward to Thee in one commingled stream Of adoration, duteous as divine. Thou Infinite! since first creation roll'd Of heaven thy mercy hath a shade reveal'd To Nature's heart; in ev'ry age or clime, Heard in the wind, or by the tempest robed, Or in the parent-sun presumed to shine, Still has immortal soul been stamp'd with Thee! Oh, all which thought can span, or eye perceive, Is but a part, a shadow of Thy Power Creating, filling, and upholding All! The arch'd immensity above us spread, Where mystic worlds their silent march perform, And Seasons live, and act; the chainless Deep Belting the earth with majesty and might; The mountains pinnacled with storms; the floods And streams, the meadows beautified with flowers, A God declare! and in the thunder-peals Rattling from cloud to cloud their voices dire, Like Sinai, when the awe of sound convulsed Her cavern'd height,—a Deity is there! But when dark whirlwinds o'er creation sweep Like rebel Spirits plunging from the sky, We dread Thee, wing'd upon each awful blast! Fountain of Light and Love! while Nature hymns Thy praise in wave or wind, from shore to shore, Thy miniature, immortal Man, the grace And glory of the earth, with brow erect Was made the world to walk in joy; to share Thy goodness; and adore the Hand divine. Then look, Thou Universal One! Whose eye Alike on all is fix'd, with mercy view This wide and peopled World; from east to west From north to south Thy guardian care extend: In Polar climes, in lands refined or rude, In isles remote, or deserts grimly vast, Where beats a heart within a human breast There be Thou present, and Thy power adored! And oh, since all one common race are doom'd To run, and one Eternal Goal to reach, May Thy prime Attribute each bosom warm With tender sympathy and truth; may Man To man be link'd, in fellowship of soul, Till one vast chain of Love the world embrace. Unsearchable! before whose boundless gaze The Past the Present and the Future stand Submissive, we implore Thee to unshroud The Sun of truth; His heavenly beam advance From pole to pole, till on His perfect face All earth shall gaze, one glorious Altar rise, And every soul unite to hail thee, God! And, ah! may those who fight the war of faith With weapons such as brave Apostles wore, In climes where Sin and Satan darkly rage Feel holy valour, from Thy shield derived: Defend them, Thou! Whose cross their banner decks, When bleak with ice or burnt with torrid glow Deserts of gloom and death their eyes appal; Or when at midnight, round their flapping tent The hurricane like a demon howls, Let Hope descend, their falt'ring hearts confirm, And free as morning let their faith arise Again for conquest, o'er the host of Hell; While round them, daily may Redemption see Idolatry from thrones of darkness fall For ever, by the sword of Truth destroy'd. As o'er the treach'rous sea of human life We wander, till our anchor'd spirits rest In the calm haven of eternity, Without a heart-deep sense, a wakeful dread Of Thee, felt in the mind, and by the act Reveal'd, we perish on the rock of sin: Lord of the Universe! impress, we pray, Upon our minds Thy majesty, that breathes A holy freshness through the heart; and raise And animate the soul to things sublime; O'erawe the passions, and each thought arrest Which on the fiery wing of impulse roams Unheedful of the Voice within, where dwells The chronicler of virtue and of crime. Omnipotent! in every Soul be shrined: So shall our deeds be echoes of good thoughts, And at Thy dreadful summons we shall stand Unharm'd, secure amid the shock of worlds! And since to Thee the unveil'd heart be known, Nor voiceless thought, nor wish can rise, but Thou Record'st it in Thine awful Book of Life, The tempted mind oh! may we ever watch And keep it pure from each unhallow'd wish, From each depraved desire: so shall our days In beautiful declension fade; and Hope And Faith triumphant o'er the world exult; Till back recall'd, the renovated Soul Shall reap beatitude in realms of light. On each degree of men, benignant God! Thy sleepless care we pray Thee to bestow; Grave it on each adoring mind, that Heaven's Bright portals are to all unbarr'd, that high Nor mean, nor rich nor poor with Thee prevail By aught peculiar, save a perfect heart: The meanest orphan of the world may win A wreath in heaven; the humblest wear a crown Of life. And oh! may those, the gifted few, Archangels of the earth, before whose thrones Mortality will bend, and half adore, Remember what to Thee and Man they owe: May Genius never stoop to pander vice, But fix her eye on heaven, and walk the earth A Spirit conscious of her native sphere. Prime Source of being! let the richly-dower'd Forget not Him from whom their riches flow, And heaven-born Charity exult to be A bright reflection of Thy glorious Self! Her office 'tis, sweet Harbinger of love, To light the burden from oppressed hearts, To pluck the arrow from Affliction's breast, Nor leave a pang behind; and where the sad And unobtrusive Virtues toil, to shed The balm of joy, and wreathe their cup of wo With smiles accorded by approving Heaven. To Thee, to Thee alone, pervading God, The sum of human agonies is known! But wheresoe'er the race of sorrow dwell There may Thy dews of mercy fall; refresh The wither'd heart, the languid eye of Want Relume, and bid Misfortune smile again: And since from Thee the breath of Life began And on each brow the seal of God is set, Oh, hear the bitter sighs of Thraldom, breathed Morn, noon, and night, from out ten thousands hearts Of agony, to Thee: Awake, arise, God of the slave and free! and disenthral The World; bid freedom shine, and like thy sun Illume and animate Creation round. And let the young, on whose delighted gaze In hopeful beauty dawns the dream of life, In their unspotted bosoms treasure thoughts Of Thee, to guide them through the cloudy years; And may the Old, upon whose gray-worn heads An honourable crown past Time has placed, When earth grows dim, and worldly joys decay, Find heaven advancing as the world retires. Oh! Thou that fathomest the guilty mind And canst interpret each debasing thought Untold, the erring soul arouse, by Sin From Thee withdrawn; the form of Vice unveil, And bare her hideous aspect to the eye Of Truth; then, bid return the rebel heart, And blot its error with repentant tears. On him, whom Hope and Faith exalt, what dreams, What joys, and what diviner moods attend! The world He walks, as Jesus walk'd the waves, Triumphant and secure. In every scene A love for Thee prevails; Creation breathes Of heaven: the vaulted sky with stars bedropt; The Ocean roll'd to rest, or sending up Tremendous pæans to her mighty Lord; The field and flower; whate'er in noontide walk Is sweet, to Him his wondering heart allure, The source and spirit of the moving Whole. All order, beauty, and perfection here Form but the shadows of more perfect Bliss Cast from a purer world; he dwells in Thee, And Thou in him; Heaven seems his native home And Immortality embowers him there. Not for the fleeting joys of Life alone We pray, and those by blood or truth allied: When Life's fierce storms are hush'd, and Death that veil Undraws, beyond which never human glance Hath seen, oh, then be present, viewless Power! And calm the pangs of Nature's closing scene: Let haunting fears, nor fiery dreams the past Recall; but may the grave a future bed Of glory be; around the dying couch May bands of sympathetic Angels watch, And waft the wingèd Spirit to its home. Omnipotent! at Whose creative word Eternity a shining host sent forth Of worlds, to balance in the beauteous air, Still may the Sun upon his dazzling brow Thy smile of mercy o'er mankind reflect; Still let abundance crown the year; still roll The seasons o'er a prosperous land, and breeze And blast, and all the treasure of the clouds The pregnant earth enrich, and heap the load Of human gratitude to gracious heaven! Incarnate King of kings, and Lord of lords! Since at thy fiat empires rise and fall And melt like palaces of painted cloud, Mantle our cherish'd Country with Thy wings Of glory: may she prosper in the pride Of liberty; Her ancient throne around Let all the kingly virtues throng; and bid Thy delegate, the Monarch of our Land, Be graced with wisdom, and his sceptre wield The majesty of Justice and of Truth; May he be great and good, and ever find A loving bulwark in the People's heart! But with the prayer let boundless praise ascend On wings that never droop. We praise Thee, God! For life and limb; we praise Thee, God! for health And wisdom, hope divine, and deathless truth; For each vast symbol of Thy power portray'd By this dread Universe, where Thou art seen, As ocean mirrors an imperial sun. In feeble infancy, when on the breast We hang in slumber, Thy protecting Hand O'ershades us; on our steps Thine angels wait; And day by day, Thou shap'st the formless mind, Teaching the thought to bud, the tongue to speak, And on the heart reflecting grace and truth, Which are the flashes that Thyself reveal. And thus, through all the ravell'd maze of life With viewless guidance Thou direct'st our feet, Till, lo! upon that awful Brink we stand Where shines the light which leads to Heaven the soul. But Thine infinity of awful love Oh who can fathom, when th' Incarnate came And bade the moral resurrection dawn? He look'd,—and in His glance grew bright the Earth! Her slavish eye Idolatry unscaled, While Superstition from her gloom arose Burst from her bonds, and with an angel-shout From east to west the Hallelujah rang! Victor of Death! mysterious God and Man, Who bore the vial of almighty Wrath Upon His head outpour'd, the tomb unlock'd, Trampled on Hell, and oped the gates of Heaven To banish'd Man, hail Prince of Peace! enthroned In glory, with Thy co-eternal Sire, Our prayer accept, the incense of the soul, And hallow it with Thy perfecting grace. Thou Light of Light! by ancient seers foretold, And by prophetic minstrels hymn'd, the sun And centre of our faith, redeeming Christ! Look down, and consecrate thy Church below: Around it rally all thy faithful hearts, Pillars beyond the power of Hell to shake! Reluctant time roll on; and spread from land To land, from isle to isle, the Word of Truth Till Earth shall seem one universal soul. But all is fruitless, save Thy Spirit teach, Console, attract, illumine and adorn The penitential Mind. Can deaf men feel How Music wakens her enchanted might; Or blind ones, when the lids of Morning ope, Greet the proud radiance of commencing day? So dull, and eyeless to the words and beams Of truth heaven-sanction'd, is the rocky heart, Before an unction of converting grace Descend, and bid the glorious change begin. Or, mark the body, when the soul is fled, How pale and powerless, how corrupt and cold It lies, and withers like a Dream of clay! So dead to things transcendently divine In carnal trance the soul itself abides, Till comes Thy Spirit with celestial breath, The faded lineaments of God revives And quickens nature with transforming power: Then, Thou art all, and all in Thee resides. Eternity upon the Book of Life Reflected, how sublime the means of Grace! In Christ what love immeasurably deep Embodied! what a glory robes the Cross! Each word, each promise, each divine appeal By Thee brought home, how vast redemption grows! Vile passions sink; and low affections raised, No longer worm-like creep in dust and gloom, But, wing'd by faith, beyond the world ascend, Exulting round The Throne, and hearing oft Faint echoes of some archangelic hymn To Jesu chanted; Who, as Lord of deed And life of thought, o'er all our being reigns; And oft, by sacred fascination led, To Calvary our yearning Hearts retire, Kneel at the Cross, and see the Saviour die! Be with us, Lord, till years of fadeless bloom Act the bright wonders which Isaiah sung, And Eden, lovelier far than Adam saw, Lit by the Sun of Righteousness, appear! And when at length Thy gospel-Kingdom comes, When the last Trumpet wakes the trance of time And thunders roll creation's knell, Thine eye Shall beam with mercy; and Thy voice will sound A welcome to the Skies; while, angel-wing'd, Myriads ascend to shine immortal there.

The morn is up; on Woodland's eastern sky Masses of cloud in rich confusion lie; Awhile they mingle, then apart they glide Like painted isles upon a far-off tide: Till, orb'd with glory, see! the sun appear To light the world, and lead the Day's career. Now from yon hamlet's moss-grown chimneys rise Wreaths of blue smoke which curl along the skies, And far the stir of village-life resounds And rings the morning air with merry sounds. Ask ye of Woodland, site of boyish days? A village, such as Goldsmith's verse might praise: The grey church glimm'ring through the dark elm-trees, Whose pealing chimes oft harmonise the breeze; A Gothic mansion on the green withdrawn, With freckled steps and smoothly-levell'd lawn, Where priest and parish sages oft retire And bow obsequious to the ruddy squire; An ocher'd inn behind a bench-girt tree, Where chatt'ring statesmen kindly disagree,— These are the noblest piles on Woodland's plain, To charm the pilgrim, or delight the swain. Though barren now, not so when summer-bloom Spreads a bright magic over winter's gloom, Fair Woodland looks, and every garden greets The way-worn traveller with exulting sweets. The gravel winding to the lilac-bower Where shaded friends beguile their sultry hour; The guarded hive where humming bees abound, The well-rope creaking forth its homely sound, The fairy babble of a road-side stream Where the brown urchin shapes his infant dream, With many a charm awake the wand'rer's smile, Tempting his eye to pause, and dream awhile. But to our scene!—Beside yon beaten road Behold the village Curate's neat abode; Time-worn, it stands in unobtrusive state Behind the circling pales and ivied gate, With pointed windows based by massy beams, Where orient Morn delights to shed her gleams: No fruits, or flower-parterres in spruce array! The night-beads glisten on the leafless spray, And, safely housed within his pendent cote, The plaintiff pigeon coos his winter-note. But in yon parlor, where a window-blaze Now flickers redly o'er the white-frost haze, And the bold robin, fed by infant-zeal, Pecks from the scatter'd crumbs his morning meal, How merrily resounds the mingled din Of social love and life, awake within! Bright on the pictured wall the fire-beams play; There the loud tea-urn sings its bubbling lay, And on the glossy table-cloth are spread The glitt'ring china and the cottage-bread: The parting hour, like death itself to meet, Is come!—the curate from his calm retreat, Doom'd by domestic care, awhile must roam And leave the heaven which Virtue forms at home. Around him now a darling group is met With faithful looks of fondness and regret; Yon fair-brow'd child, the gentle, loving, good, And budding sweetly into womanhood, Presidingly the breakfast-rite surveys While a meek sorrow dims her pensive gaze; One prattling cherub, with infantine grace, Leaps on his knee, and pats his smiling face, While elder boys within their hearts receive The counsel pious fathers care to give. But, ah! what lovely dews of feeling rise, Melt from the soul, and glitter in her eyes, As moves the mother with a placid mien And fondly hovers round this parting-scene! Full well yon tender sire perceives the care, And smiles it off with many a winning air; Talks of his quick return, the news he'll tell, And looks, what language could not speak so well! But, hark! the merry bugle peals a sound Till the roused echoes ring the hills around! From doors half open'd peeps out many a face, The grandam hobbles from her wonted place, While noisy urchins scour the village through, To hail the Stage-coach wheeling into view!— That Thing of glory to a rustic throng Who shout and gambol as it whirls along; Or, idly vent'rous, balance at its back Braving the guard, and whip's repeated smack; While at the blacksmith's murky door preside, With solemn eyes, and mouths all gaping wide, A prying group—that pertinacious class Who quiz profoundly as the coaches pass! Triumph of Art! extemporaneous home! For pain or pleasure unto all who roam; Compactly fashion'd to a useful form, To poise the burden, and defy the storm, Let Life and Commerce, Love and Duty show What daily blessings to thy speed we owe: Sure of thy succour, see the Friend depart, To press the absent to his faithful heart; Swift as thy speed, behold the Lover fly On Love's warm breast to breathe his welcome sigh; The proud and mean, the hapless and the gay, Thou waft'st them all, along their varied way! And pleasant 'tis when Winter's flooding rains Flash on the pools, and beat the rattling panes, Snug in a Coach's padded nook to lie, Stretch the free limb, and close the languid eye: But sweeter far, on some auspicious day When lovely clouds the crystal sky inlay, And choral breezes o'er the meadow spring Like uncaged birds exultant on the wing, Throned on a coach to leave the smoke-dimm'd town, And view the vernal mead and sloping down, The wood-crown'd hills, and laughing streams that glide While sunbeams gambol on their gurgling tide. How warms the spirit into young delight As views romantic greet the gladden'd sight! While lip and brow partake the fresh-wing'd breeze, Till fancy echoes to the warbling trees; 'Tis now, as slow and soft some distant bell Dies on the air with solemnising spell, That worldly feelings faint off, one by one, Like ice-drops melted by the noontide sun; Till, soften'd all, they mix in one soft sigh, Or bask delighted in the beaming eye! On morn like this, to quiet hearts how sweet To leave the noise of life for some retreat, Where haply dwells in his Arcadian cot Far from the world and by the world forgot, The friend of virtue, gentle, wise and good, In mental ease and classic solitude; There, warm at heart, within his social room Where fragrant woodbines waft their mild perfume, At eve's soft hour, behold the vesper-star And talk of vanish'd scenes and friends afar; Renew the hours of rapture and of pain, The past create, and be the boy again! By moonlight, too, when vale and coppice gleam Like landscapes pictured in a poet's dream, How charming from the coach, with half-closed eye To mark the glimm'ring meadows gliding by: The spectral valley, or the dark-brow'd hill, The woods in dewy slumber, dark and still, Or taper twinkling from some far abode, Or waggon winding up the lonesome road, While the meek night-bird's melancholy lay Melts like a wreath of woven sound away. Not least the coach's charm let schoolboys tell, When to their prison-walls they shout, farewell! Then through the joy-wing'd night glib tongues display The fairy visions of their homeward way; And oft the ceaseless tongue would fain relate What coach-wheels rattle at the school-yard gate! But who, emburied in his coat's broad fold, With triple kerchief round his neck enroll'd, Stalks forth, with brindled waistcoat, full and free, And glossy boots, braced o'er his giant knee? Our Coachman! who, with smiling pomp and mien, Full-blown and square, directs the road-machine. Alike when winter wraps the world in snow, Or o'er it summer sheds her sleepy glow; Not unimportant is his busy post, Or on the road, or parleying with my Host, Or when, with merry eye and mottled face, The whip he twirls, whose ev'ry turn is grace! Happy the trav'ller who on coachey's throne May sit, and make the country round his own; Well pleased to hear him, with official pride, To asking strangers act the courteous guide; Point with his whip to each patrician house, Portray the owner, or depict his spouse; Or, fraught with whisper'd tales of sly import, Presume to paint a Baron for his sport! Then, too, what puns and proverbs quaint he knows! What ruddy humour on each feature glows, When, gazing round him with theatric leer, He tells the freaks of many a by-gone year! But see, the fond farewells are said and o'er, And, lo! the Curate, at the coach's door, Smiles on the red-cloak'd dames and hoary men Who humbly wish him safe return'd again: Up roll the steps,—the echoes of the horn Far on the breeze from hill to hill are borne; And see, along the road's extended sweep, Loud as the billows lording o'er the deep, Again the bick'ring wheels their course renew, And Woodland fades amid the distant view. And now, while languid mists dissolve away And golden sun-tints o'er the landscape play, Look round! the unpretending view admire; From shady dingles peeps the taper spire, While far around yon richly-wooded green What still romance o'erveils the rural scene. But most the pilgrim eye delights to see My Country! monarch of th' imperial Sea! Those ancient mansions where thy Gentles dwell, And grace the homes their fathers built so well. Far on the lawn, amid the leafy shade, Behold the porch and pillar'd walls display'd: Hark! round the Park, begirt with olden trees, The sheep-bells shake their echoes on the breeze; Fleet on his fairy foot, the timid deer, With glancing eye pursues his wild career; While browsing cattle crop the stunted food, And snuff the wind with conscious gratitude. And long, fair England! may such homes be seen, In modest grandeur shadow'd o'er the green; Long may the country-Gentleman be found The grateful lord of his paternal ground: Far from suburban toil, and meaner care, No midnight-brawls, no masquerading there, A bounteous fortune, and a feeling breast, Loved by the good, and by the humble blest,— How calm he marks the bloom of life decay, How breeze-like float the fleeting hours away! And ah! forgive the wand'rer, doom'd to roam O'er life's autumnal waste, without a home, If chance an unforbidden wish should swell For some dear haunt, where Love and Truth might dwell: How blithely would he hail the welcome dawn And stroll enamour'd round his dew-bright lawn! Or when pale twilight hued the garden-trees And the boughs twinkled in their vesper-breeze, Delighted stray, with heavenward feeling fraught, And wind the mazes of immortal thought! But from the road unnumber'd scenes transfuse O'er the quick mind, reflection's moral hues; Each, as it passes, claims a sigh or tear For Want, or Wo, and all their offspring, here. There, the blind beggar, led by faithful Tray, Bareheaded moans along his mournful way; Here, a lean pedlar winds his wintry track With wallet strapp'd upon his weary back; And far withdrawn on yonder coppice-green, Like wood-born regents of the lonely scene, The sun-brown gipsies o'er their caldron gaze And watch the faggots crackle as they blaze. But lo! a livelier scene: beside the wheel, Wild urchins whirling round from head to heel; Around and round, and still around they turn, Till lip and eye with bright suffusion burn, Then mildly beg, with upward-looking face, Some poor reward to crown their wheel-side race. And oft to him, whose moral Eye hath been A quaint observer of Life's comic scene, Hath social Travel true instruction brought, Which form'd a theme for many an after thought. Abroad, our lines of character appear; For who would crouch to affectation here, Where all are free, unknown, and unrestrain'd, And fashion profitless, however feign'd? A rapid meeting (like the glad surprise Of nature, when a sun-burst brings the dyes Of verdure wood and water into life Each with a sudden power of freshness rife) Calls traits of mind and tones of feeling forth And bold opinion in its native worth! Within the compass of a hundred miles, How vast a subject for our frowns, or smiles! How much that opens like a scenic view Of Nature's drama, such as Shakspere drew! The selfish, vain, the volatile, or proud, The pert, the spruce, the silent, and the loud, All, in their turn, some living truth impart Which threads the labyrinth that conceals the heart. Meanwhile, our rumbling Coach pursues its way, Adorn'd with passengers—and who are they? Inside, and warm'd with sympathy, recline A Politician and a plain Divine; The first can lay the cabinet quite bare, And fathom all the well of wisdom there! A smile of candour clothes his merry cheek, And his eyes twinkle what his heart would speak: Genteely plain in periwig and vest,— Let buckled shoes and snuff-box speak the rest! Within a coach, perchance we oft may find Some choice companion with a kindred mind; Here, unsubdued by ceremonious fear, The sterling traits of Character appear; And thoughts unmanacled by mean control Flash bright and clear, like sparkles from the soul. Shame on the Man who drones himself away, When conversation should have turn to play! A Soul so bare, companionless, and cold, Can scarce be stamp'd in nature's kindly mould, Who bids the social flame to kindle, when We meet, though strangers, with our fellow men. Commend me him who with colloquial art His tongue can loose, and let out half the heart; Above suspicion, conscious of no end, He turns the stranger to a passing friend,— Refined or rude, no matter, if the mind Be meet for converse, and for truth inclined. With him a journey yields delightful ease, His wit may gladden, and his wisdom please; Long miles escape amid such talking charms, The temper brightens, and acquaintance warms. And such is he, whose glowing tongue hath sped As if a parliament were in his head; How well he weaves each patriotic plan, And, like a Minister, selects his man! A war condemns, or conquers distant climes, And paints the leading wonder of the times; With fond remembrance turns to scenes of yore, And mourns that mind will be revived no more, As when, with eagle-glance, great Chatham rose, And flash'd defiance to his country's foes; As when, enrapt, immortal Burke he saw The House inspire, and give the world a law! Mean while, the pensive Curate, pleased to learn, But ventures half an answer in his turn; Remotely blest, his humble lot has been Through life to move unvalued and unseen; To watch and weep beside the couch of Woe And bid the tear of blest contrition flow; Or woo immortal mercy from the Throne, The poor protect, and make their griefs his own:— His heart replete with heavenly love and truth, The prop of age, and hallow'd guide of youth, His home the bosom-spring of tranquil joy,— Ah! who would mar him with the world's alloy? And here, oh! let one dreaming line renew That hour when Life's far ocean dawn'd in view, And, fired by young Ambition's inward flame, To battle with its stormy scenes I came. As o'er the winding street our coach-wheels roll'd And from the Abbey-dome the town-clock toll'd, How lingeringly my parting glance was cast On each loved spot that hail'd me as we past! Till far behind old Bladud's hills were seen, And glittering uplands clad by forest-green, And rocky woods enrapt in sunset-glow, With beechen valleys bathed in light below, Till dim and faint the city-mansions grew, Like cloud-shaped temples of aerial hue: Then all the heart seem'd melting into tears While fancy hover'd o'er my future years! That time hath fled; and Truth might well relate The toiling woes of life's eventful state; The tinge of circumstance that hued my hours, Not gently lost in academic bowers, But roll'd away in energetic toil, With friends to gather, and with foes to foil: But these are past; and that Great Power alone To Whom the history of hearts is known, Those chronicles of inward-life can tell Where truth and conscience in communion dwell. Night roll'd away; and when, with weary eye, I watch'd the dawn awaken in the sky, London, the vast, the wonder of mankind, The mart of Commerce, and the fount of Mind, Like an immortal Vision rose in view, Dim vast and distant in the morning-hue! How did the startled feelings rush and roll In pleasing tumult o'er my prostrate soul, When timidly, as on enchanted ground, I mark'd the peopled desert spread around; And heard the waves of Life around me roar Like echoes wafted from a distant shore, While bands of glorious Spirits that have been Rose from the dead, and stalk'd the mighty scene! Still wheels the coach along the hoof-worn road, Whose windings tell of many a mingled load; The golden sun pours forth his noontide glare, And cheeks catch beauty from the bracing air, While talking glee and social voices sound, And pleasure quickens as the tongues abound. Amid the tumult of a crowded street In pensive walk who has not chanced to meet Some unregarded wretch who seems alone, Sad as an exile in a land unknown,— A form of Woe upon whose mournful face Compassion loves the line of thought to trace? And such yon aged man, with haggard mien Who, all unconscious of the present scene, His every feature with dejection fraught, Sits in a shroud of melancholy thought: Upon that wintry brow and blighted cheek Departed years their doleful history speak! For him no welcome by a cheering hearth, No home of comfort and no song of mirth; No gentle heart to mingle with his own Pilgrim of life, he roams the world alone! On such a wither'd face and dim-worn eye, The gay might look, and learn for once, to sigh! Merriest of all whose bounding gladness feels The flush of joy a laughing eye reveals, Two schoolboys from the coach's roof resound Triumphantly, and hail the woods around; Glad as the sunbeams when the storm is o'er, That gild the wave, and gambol on the shore. Oh, could the horses like their wishes speed, Then short the road, and travelling swift indeed! And mark yon blue-eyed rogue with daring brow, Round his young heart what visions revel now! Restless and wild, all gaze and wonder he; Sky, coach, and road, he fills them all with glee! How dark a mystery to his infant mind,— The wheels advance, the bushes glide behind! Full oft a school-room dream hath pictured this, A journey home, the paragon of bliss! This heal'd up many a birch-awaken'd smart, Cut short the lesson, and relieved the heart: It comes at last! adieu to “Propria quæ,” Long-rooted verbs, and puzzling prosody, The tame sky-blue, the task-recalling bell, The stern infliction, and the piteous yell; A month of joy each parted woe repays With nights of fun and frolic-loaded days. Not he who cross'd the Rubicon for Rome, Plann'd more immensely than these rogues for home; What feats immortal on the frozen lake! What tittering mirth around the twelfth-night cake! Then snugly nestled by the parlour-fire, Hobgoblin-tales shall Christmas-eve inspire; Or, hand in hand by Love parental led, They'll see the showman smooth the lion's head! A glad spectator of these roguish two Garb'd in a time-worn suit of woollen blue, A plump-faced Tar sits by, and joys to see The heart-warm flow of boyish revelry; His tiny hat of weather-beaten straw, His twinkling eye, and look so fresh and raw, The winning bluntness of a seaman's guise,— Allure the urchins' archly-smiling eyes; Looks grow to words; and kind, without delay, With ocean-tales he charms the travell'd way; Of howling wolves that haunt the ice-bound Cape, And surges which surpass the mountain-shape, Or billows thundering by the vessel-side While mariners in swinging hammocks ride, Of these he tells; till one, with wonder grave, His hand uplifts to meet a mountain-wave, And in dread vision, eyes the shatter'd sail, And starts and shivers at the seaman's tale! A veteran Soldier, in his faded lace, One-legg'd, with plumeless cap, and scar-worn face, Upon whose sunken features, rough and plain, Is mapp'd out many a fierce and far campaign! Smiling, obeys the elder boy's behest, To read the medal on his martial breast: Though battle-roar, and moonlit-bivouac, And mounted breach, and city's dreadful sack, Return no more, his eye illumes to tell Of foe and fight he loved to brave so well; Once more in heart he marches to the sound Of deep-roll'd drums and clarion's echoing sound; Front in the rank again he seems to be, And inly shouts the song of Victory! And well the eager boy his rapture feels, To hear of clarion-voice, and cannon peals; Or how the Battle raged till setting sun, Retreat and charge, who vanquish'd, and who won; Till his heart triumphs with a warrior-glow, Pants for a sword, a charger, and a foe! But hark! the watchful guard, in champion state, Twangs his shrill summons to the turnpike-gate: And promptly coming from his spruce abode, A grey-beard opes the barrier of the road: 'Tis pass'd; and, lo! beside yon sun-bright down, The giant-shadows of the distant town; Till, brightly-towering in the noontide-blaze, A City flashes on the eager gaze! Brick walls and temples, domes, and mansions dun, And steeples whitening in the welcome sun, And banners shivering in the smoke-dimm'd air, And lofty house-roofs, slanting, broad, and bare, With the faint windings of a clear canal Like a lone pilgrim roaming far from all,— Majestic spread beneath a cloudless sky In one full mass arrest the traveller's eye. Though sweet awhile the noisy world to leave, Forsake its follies, and forget to grieve, Pleasant the city-roar renew'd again, When impulse flags, and solitude is pain! List to the clamour of the clattering street, The bickering car, and hoof, and pattering feet; The rush, the stir, the deafening, struggling din Of moving life!—but, lo, a stately Inn! Hail to the timely welcome of an Inn; Hail to the room where home and cheer begin; Where all the frost-bound feelings melt away, And soul-warm sympathies begin to play, While Independence shows her careless mien, And unforced traits of human life are seen. The crackling blaze which dyes the chimney red, The gracious substance on the table spread, The glowing wine-cup and the rich ale's foam,— Partake them all, and dream thyself at home! As round the festive board our travellers sit With appetites far sharper than their wit, What busy knives and gracious meats abound, What hissing corks and tinkling glasses sound! Some, fiercely-rapid, sheathe the gleaming blade In joints that seem for hungry pilgrims made; Some by the glittering hearth-side sit and gaze And bathe their features in its welcome blaze; Nor still the Host, who waddles here and there Like a live Barrel come to take the air! The time is past; the feast partaken, o'er; Again they journey over hill and moor; Fresh at the rein, behold yon rapid steed Roll his large eyes, and cleave the wind with speed; Thus, unimpeded with its plenteous load, The eager Coach pursues the varying road, Save when Relays from local barns are led, And horses tired move steaming to their shed. Now shadowy eve the fading woods hath crown'd, And dew and darkness shed their spirit round; Hark! o'er the hills what bugle-echoes play, And die in many an ebbing note away; Behold! the Mail in glimmering pomp appears, And, as it onward speeds, what smiles and tears, What shades of time, or accident, or scene, And memories for all which life has been It brings,—to sadden, sweeten, or beguile The myriad hearts within our crowded isle! Perchance the morrow will an orphan hail, A wife be weeping o'er some funeral-tale, A friend be doom'd in distant isles to roam, And music cease in many a happy Home! Where is the heart unmoved by more than glee, Where is the eye which kindles not to see That spot where first our beam of Life began, And Youth put on the energies of Man? When far remote from youth's regretted scene, Imagination sped the way between, And, hovering round each well-known spot, restored All which young memory loved, and heart adored! A Sabbath-bell recall'd the street we trod Each holy morn, to hymn the name of God; A ballad-singer in his homely strain Would thrill the bosom with delicious pain, As oft beneath the moon's romantic ray We mused on home and friendship far away: At length return'd, again we glow to greet Each favorite spot and unforgotten street; Once more on haunted wood and stream to gaze, And clasp the shadow of departed Days. And lo! upon yon Sailor's swarthy brow What home-born feeling is enkindled now? What tear-drops gush from out his happy soul As up familiar lanes the coach-wheels roll, Joy flies from lip to brow, through heart and limb, The very houses seem to welcome him! Though doom'd awhile a foreign Deep to roam, Each breeze and blast had wing'd a blessing home; Where Hope and Memory bade him oft retire And tell sea-tales around his winter fire. But list! the Schoolboys' mingled shouts of glee Round a fond parent dancing merrily! Such bliss to come, such pain and peril past, Can their glib tongues unload the heart too fast? The old man smiles, and mingles with their joy, Pleased to remember he was once a boy; And blandly paints the joyous scenes to come As hand in hand he leads the prattlers home. Reader! a pensive Moral ere we part And be its tablet thy persuaded heart; Our vanish'd day like human Life hath been, An onward-view of many a varied scene, A changeful path, where faces come and go, Friends meet and part,—like all we love below! Thus on, till Life's eventful journey's o'er, And meeting Souls embrace, to part no more. SCARBOROUGH. A DESCRIPTIVE SKETCH. —1846. Farewell the scene, but not farewell the charm Of ancient Scarbro'! Long as mem'ry lives And for my past a secret mansion builds Within me, like a sacred Thing I prize, Her touching beauties shall be unforgot And treasured there, with no affected love. The spirit of the olden time's romance Haunts her loved scenes, where each abiding grace, By Nature hallow'd, blooms unwither'd still; And beautiful are all her wooded bays, Her winding creeks of loveliness and calm And mounts of woodland-green, as when the Saxon gazed In dreaming sternness, or with soften'd brow, At twilight on them, while the rosy tinge Of vesper-clouds o'erveil'd the ocean-rocks Before him. History, too, may yet perceive, Where the helm'd Roman in his banner'd pride Lifted those eagles which o'erswept the world, Invincible in valour. Lone and sad, Wrapt in a shroud of melancholy thought, With heart unecho'd, and with mind unnerved, I thank thee, God! that often I have won From scenes that here are eloquent of Thee, Feelings divine, and hopes from heaven new-born, Grandeur and Beauty, with a bliss serene That o'er my future like a dew will steal Hereafter, when the feverish world may fret My soul, and shore and sea lie far away. Where rise the hills, and rolls the sacred Deep Her minstrelsy of many-voicèd waves, There, is the Poet's haunt, and home of song! If true to Nature, his responsive heart Replies in music to those myriad calls Which still accost him from Her shrines august, Or lone, or lovely; then, the lyre of thought Is thrill'd with magic, and each pensive chord Vibrates at once in poetry and praise. For, aye between the mountains and the mind, Infinite Soul and God's unfathom'd Sea, A poetry of pure attraction dwells For ever. Ye have felt it! who the Lyre Have struck, by intellectual beauty charm'd, In answer to a living harp of song Within you, Poets! that our mystic world Alone interpret, and to thought create A richer Paradise than Adam saw, Ere ruin fell on Eden's forfeit-bowers. Is it that mountains are our kindred types And, in their soaring majesty of shape Between two worlds thus gloriously uplift, Instruct us, heavenward how the heart ascends When man with his high Maker most communes? Does Ocean, in her measureless profound Deep within deep interminably sunk, E'en like an echo of the soul's abyss, With dread eternity appear instinct? We cannot tell; enough for Truth to feel That Man and Nature are responsive works, Shaped into concord by a Hand divine. Here while I muse, what inspirations throng Full on my sense, and through the mind o'erflow, Till fancy kindles, and a fervent rush Of bright emotions, blent with deeper thoughts, Pour inwards: like an intellectual flood From some heart-fountain, suddenly unseal'd As if by magic, and with radiant speed Rolling at once through all the spirit-depths! Look where you can, the Beautiful is there, Touch'd with that boldness rock-bound waters lend To each loved region on our island-coast. Look where you please! some answering grace responds To your charm'd glance; as if with conscious power Rich Nature in her prodigal supply Of blent attractions, tender, green, or wild, Echo'd the spirit of your wish, and gave Her all of lovely in one view combined; That so, elysian fancy might be lull'd With landscapes Eden-like, and full of God. In azure brightness, lo! that billow'd Sea Rolling in rapture, and alive with beams Of sun-made glory, with a living joy Oh, how it heaves its bounding way along, Cheer'd by young breezes! like a poet's heart Panting with visions, which before him rise, And bear him onward with a swelling pulse Of passion, dreaming, daring, and sublime! This cliff below, in green remoteness raised, I mark the outlines of the curvèd shore Upward receding with a gradual rise Of roofs, and mansions, blendingly array'd; While to the left a grassy mount appears O'er which, mid benchèd walks, and shaded bowers, In stream-like windings artificial paths Ascend, and glitter in the glow of eve. But, near the brink of yon impending height, The proud Marine its modern piles erects On high; and full before its window'd front The surging vastness of the German sea For ever rolls, and still for ever charms How many a land-sick Heart, that often sigh'd To look once more upon the leaping waves Of laughing ocean! But, again behold How the brave skill of architectural man. Both height and depth can subject and reduce To his proud service! There, the high-poised Bridge O'erarches with magnificent effect The cloven hills, and both in one combines: Beneath the circle of each ponderous arch The fascinating blue of ocean breaks Softly, and sweetly on arrested eyes, That downward from the cresting hills o'ergaze The sea-girt landscape. Freshly shines the Main, Rippled with breezes, and with sun-beams clothed Which make her waves like liquid diamonds flash, Dazzling the eye with over-bright excess Hither and thither, where no shade intrudes. How gently, o'er the beach the swelling tide Rolls inward! falling with melodious plunge, It murmurs to the Town's contiguous walls And garden trees, which round the shore descend,— As if the Sea were conscious that her waves Were loved, or look'd upon with greeting eyes, And hearts which echo those poetic strains Each breezy stanza to the billow sings! Behind me, in their yellow ripeness spread, The upland cornfields, o'er whose bladed stalks Bending with produce, play the choral airs From ocean wafted, till the meadows breathe A fitful undersong, and wild-flowers laugh In waving gladness. List! the larks are poised High in the air, and trill their lyric strains Above me, in an ecstasy of sound, And seem to quiver forth their vesper hymns. But lo, the magic of yon peerless Main! How graceful in majestic strength she heaves Her breast of waters, tinged with gorgeous hues From heaven reflected, while her boundless spread Of billows gently to the breeze upcurls! Far as our straining eyes can stretch the view, Rolls that vast ocean the horizon round Her volumed waters, till both sea and sky Look wedded in the distance. Near the shore Or sanded beach, the gambolling children bathe, And in the foam and freshness of the wave Plunge their delighted heads, and disappear A moment, then, again their dripping frames Lift into light, all innocently clad. While many a bark, symmetrical and small, Opes its white sail, and on the azure calm Mirrors its beauty; like a bird it moves Born of the sea, and on the waters bred; With such a vital grace it seems to glide O'er the light wavelets, which around it curl Amid those taller vessels. O'er the strand Rising within the bay's prolong'd recess, Bold Scarbro' with her slanting roofs appears, That redden dimly, now the pallid beam Of sunset strikes them. Hark! her busy hum In broken cadence to the ear is brought, And not unpleasing; while beneath this cliff Where now I watch, the pulsing billows play In languid motion, while its pebbled base They moisten; or, in lulling tones dissolve Of sea-born music, exquisitely sad. But stranger! high o'er all the Town behold, Breathing stern history from its haunted walls And mangled towers, yon warlike Castle frowns: Sublime in ruins, like Romance in stone, Still to the present does it preach the past With more than language! There, a moral sigh O'er the gone splendour of heroic times May well be heaved, when Chivalry prevail'd, And knightly bosoms with heroic pulse Were beating nobly, as the brave became! Now turn from man, for God himself is nigh Whene'er His Temple to the heart appeals, Like mute religion!—Thus, St. Mary's shrine, Dim with dead ages, lifts her hoary pile, And almost touches into pensive tears The hearts who view her, bow'd and bent with time: Conventual mother of Cistercian monks, Once in the pride and pomp of Romish art Her structure tower'd, and o'er this ancient Burgh Ruled like a queen; but now, both damp and dust Feed on her walls, and waste her mouldering form. And can Wealth look upon a wreck like this, Nor feel the blush of self-rebuke to burn Into her conscience? Is the Christ we serve To Mammon given, while with hoarding grasp A hideous worship unto heartless Gold We proffer, gripe our bloated incomes back, And grudge to God the boon we well might give, From Faith how due, to feeling how divine! But in her widowhood St. Mary's pile Affectingly to pious hearts appeals: From this far mount I view her churchyard-slopes With tombstones populous, whose pallid fronts In the slant brightness of the sunset gleam, And glisten o'er the humbler graves which lie Beneath them, nameless as the grass that mourns Of death unconscious, when the night-airs wake. Methinks, that in her mournfulness august E'en like a Mother, does that hallow'd Fane Gaze on the tombs which round about her seem To nestle; while to living Souls she pleads, That once again the pious and the pure Her ruin'd Shrine may raise, till Gothic arch And roof majestic o'er rapt thousands bend Within Her gather'd, full of praise and prayer. Yet, ere we part from such ideal bliss This hour of beauty and this heaven of scene Embosom, yonder local charm survey; That Light-house, in its guardian pride erect, Gilded by sunshine, when it haply gleams Full on its whited column, points afar Through storm and gale, to mariners at Sea Rock'd on rude surges; or, at misty night Becalm'd, when Darkness and the Deep embrace In black confusion, like a spectral gloom, To them it beckons with its beacon-ray For ever welcome to their wave-toss'd view; And often, when the glassy ocean sleeps, Projects its shadow with unbroken trace Of imaged portraiture, the tide along. There is a nobleness in nature's gifts; A free enchantment; and a bold delight Flow from her vital scenes of grace, or power, Or beauty, did but man his bosom yield To fine impressions, breathed from sylvan haunts. Oh! none but hearts sectarian, shut, and cold, Contracted into smallness, vain as vile, Which do not in the cheering thought exult, How catholic entire Creation looks And glorious! loving all whose souls reply To grace, or grandeur, clothing hills and dales. If to loud Cities men contraction owe, 'Tis from the Country minds a largeness gain Healthful and hallow'd, open as the skies Above them, nobly breathing freedom's air! 'Tis from her landscapes our loved England takes A moral freshness, and romantic tinge That hues her heart with beauty: Commerce dries The soul of Cities into venal dust, Or, sanctions false refinement; but from shores Embay'd in quiet, or from rock-girt waves, Where on the beach with loud pulsation swells The billowy heart of God's mysterious sea For ever, may the town-worn race derive Emotions, which immortalise their play In that deep inwardness where feeling dwells. Thus, let them wander by the sanded beach O'er rocks, and crags familiar with the clouds Where the red morning throws her radiant blush, By meadows, lakes, or lanes of twilight green Devious and far, to view those rustic charms Which clothe our hamlets with an English grace Unrivall'd. Nature is no dull effect, No dead appearance of an outward show To sense confined; but, oft in secret wields A bosom-influence, when the gazer's eye Hath long departed from the scene it saw. Many a tone of tenderness and truth Comes to a heart, in city-prisons pent, Where joyless Labour plies her feverish task Incessant,—not from streets of noise, and strife, But from the stillness of remember'd fields, From inland-quiet, landscapes hush'd and lone, Or, from the magic of poetic waves In breezy chorus, such as now resounds Time-honour'd Scarbro'! o'er thy sweeping bay. Ideal landscapes beautify sad minds Immersed in cities, worn and wasted down Into a wreck of carking wo, and care Emaciate; or, amid some crowded mart Of commerce, where in rooms of airless toil Britannia's helots drudge, for Mammon's lords, Through tedious rounds of everlasting toil Healthless as hopeless, day by day, and year By year, like work-Machines, unsoul'd for hire! Hence, may the Country man's remembrance haunt With freshening beauty, and the fever cool Of pent-up weariness, and unvoiced woe. And thus will Hearts benignant, wise and meek, Of Christian tone and temper, e'er rejoice In the chance-visit, which the o'erlabour'd poor And pale mechanic to some rustic mead, Or ocean, pays; and trust they there imbibe Beautiful thoughts, or spells of inward power To charm remembrance, when hereafter-toil Hangs on each life-pulse, like a choking weight Which burdens health, or blasts it to decay! With man in sympathy all Nature moves, And human Destiny: her forms his doom Embody: featured for his primal good By Hands celestial, when from God he fell And glory, Nature felt the awful shock Of his disaster! and, alike she waits That hour millennial, when regenerate Earth From the dark curse deliver'd, shall exult In beauty, richer far than Eden wore, And hush the groan which twice three thousand Years Have ever breathed for purity and heaven! But lo! the Day has died, and o'er the waves Shadow and silence like two spirits creep; Rock, hill, and radiant shore and castled fort Melt into dimness; while the plaintive chime Of lone St. Mary's o'er the landscape wafts A sound of sadness, which the hour beseems. Here ends my strain, imperfect but sincere; Such passing tribute from a pilgrim Bard, Stranger, accept; and with him, gently cry, Farewell the scene! but not farewell the charm Of ancient Scarbro': Beauty and Romance Are thine, thou region of the rock and wave! And priests of Nature, such as poets are, May well enshrine thee in their songs, and make Thy scene immortal to melodious hearts. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. WRITTEN, FOR THE MOST PART, IN EARLY YEARS. INFANTS AND THEIR GLORY. (1840.) “Of such,” the kingdom in the skies prepared. Alas! how rarely do such words impress An awe most vital, on the Souls which read The letter only, but the life forego. For here Philosophy and Reason stand Rebuked, and silent; learning, language, art, The palms of Mind, the laurels of Renown, The shout of Senates, and the world's applause, How weak, and worthless, absolutely nought When rank'd beside the destiny of babes! And yet, to souls of earth, who measure truth By sight, organic flesh alone they seem Scarce by a spark of intellect inspired! A mother's plaything, or a father's toy, Incarnate trifles, fit for woman's smile To gild and welcome, or her lulling voice To soothe and soften when the temper cries, Such may they look, to undiscerning mind! But, since Emmanuel hath the skies unveil'd And taught Religion to behold them there, As true inheritors of conscious bliss In yon bright kingdom,—let our Faith a child Revere; and look upon its pleading form With love, by venerating awe subdued; As well we ponder, how beneath that frame, Though fragile as the web of dew, there lies A spirit with eternity instinct! Nor doubt, that He whose hallow'd unction gave Prophets their light and brave Apostles zeal, Through all its faculties can so diffuse Enlarging grace, that what on earth appear'd Little beyond a mindless form of clay, At the first bound which into light it makes When disembodied,—may at once eclipse Archangels in their knowledge; and from God A coronet beyond the Cherubim to match In splendour, on its infant-brow receive! But dare we, by some earth-born pride betray'd, Presume to question, why a sinless babe In this bleak world of wo and crime, should live? If but a moment on this earth it breathe, Untaught, untried, untempted and unskill'd, Neither by reason proved, nor faith inform'd, What is it, but a blank of being lost, In life all mystery, and in death no more? Yet who are we, but stammering babes of dust, When upward as to God's untold designs Fancy attempts to soar on fearless wing? But thou, fond mother! o'er thy pallid child In coffin'd beauty for the tomb array'd, Cold as the flowers which on it calmly lie, Hush the wild language of thy heart's despair! For in the twilight of our doom there flash Gleams of instruction through the cloud of death By wisdom darted on believing souls. See, how the Fall when infants die, is proved, Stung by that fatal sting, which stingeth all! Mute sermons preach they upon primal Sin Beyond all pulpits, in their palmiest hour Of eloquence and truth! O who that feels The wear and waste of this soul-trying world Where life is one long martyrdom to most, However gilded, back would e'er recall The child of mercy, unto heaven resumed? The crown it wears, but has not fought the fight, Reaches the goal, but has not won the race; Balm to bereavement let this thought inspire! But with it, may this added comfort blend,— That as eternity the dead absorbs Youthful, or aged, our affections seek That mystic Home with more familiar sway. 'Tis not a solitude which awed Amaze Dreads to encounter; but a peopled clime Fill'd with the loved and lost, we long to meet And once more welcome! And beyond this bright Assurance may consoled Reflection press Inquiry: for when shuddering Reason starts To think on millions of unpitied babes Mangled, and massacred in heathen climes, How do those words, so tenderly profound Of Jesus, light the path of Providence, Which tell us, Heaven the murder'd child receives, Whose death-pangs lift a stainless heart to God, Through early martyrdom to glory rapt. And hence, true mothers! ye, at least, are bound To Jesus; in His words an echo dwells To each inquiry, which beyond the grave Longs to pursue an infant's parted soul. Love to Emmanuel! let your motto be; And so on Childhood's brow of beauty gaze, As that whereon the Sacrament shall print A sealing import; then, your child devote Like Anna, early to the Lord of love, And from the cradle guide it to the Cross! NOBLENESS OF FAITH. Deistic Thomas, with his doubting mind, I envy not that most exacting man Though eye to eye and face to face he stood Before Messiah; and, with hand outstretch'd And daring finger to his wounds applied, Answer'd his doubt, and silenced unbelief By evidence, which drew his adoration forth With over-awed amazement. He to sight And sense appeal'd; and well were both assured When the mild Saviour to his eye appear'd, Thrilling that doubter with resistless proof,— E'en by the print, and pressure of those wounds Whence gush'd salvation o'er a guilty world! But rather let me, with a glance of faith All time pervade, by Christ Himself inspired; And in the glass of His describing Word His life and lineaments of beauty trace. Child of the Church, and by Her creed sustain'd, By prayer, and praise, and Her memorial rites, Doctrines and duties and the hallow'd round Of fasts and festivals, oh! let me learn The sense to crucity; and walk by faith As prophets, patriarchs, and priests have done; By grace empower'd beyond mere sight to live, And earth-born feelings, in their finest mood. For not to Thomas did that blessing come, Which round the weakest who can now adore And clasp Emmanuel with the mind's embrace, Hovers like music,—from the lenient mouth Of Christ descending on the souls of all Who though they see not, yet the Lord believe In risen glory. Thus can Faith exalt Man out of self, and unto God reduce His errant nature, as its proper home. Sense but the shadow, Faith the substance holds; And while the pageantries of Earth and Time Like golden clouds which line the glowing west In airy nothingness have died away, That glorious Infinite of truth will beam Brighter and brighter, which pure faith pursues: Till what in weakness now we dimly scan, By open vision future heaven shall prove, And God unveil'd our spirit's glory be. WORDSWORTH. A thought the universe in worth outweighs View'd as dead Matter, meaningless and dumb: Hence, on some Form where intellect is shrined, And genius dwells, in purity of power To God and wisdom dedicate, we gaze With no cold glance, by common love inspired. And thus, on Him, that venerable Bard! A laurell'd Priest of poetry and truth, August with years, by mournful calm subdued, With filial reverence my spirit look'd When first I heard him, in his mountain-home, My entrance welcome. Boyhood's pensive dawn Ideal magic from his mental springs So oft had drunk, that when their breathing Source Before me stood embodied, all the spells His numbers wielded seem'd in one combined And round my soul in high remembrance drawn, Till like a Seer, or Hierarch of mind And melody, immortal Wordsworth thrill'd My heart, and made it vibrate into tears! For tones there are in his creative verse By childhood not unecho'd: but when age Deepens the character, and powers awake To more majestic strains attuned, his thoughts The hidden lyre of consciousness within Electrically move, and mental chords By him are touch'd, which prove the soul divine. When thus indebted to his wealth of mind, How could I gaze on that capacious brow Open and high, and like an arch of thought O'er eyes of intellectual blandness curved, Or scan the lines, or view those silver'd locks Which o'er his countenance a hoary grace Suffused, and not ennobling homage pay. What! shall mere Nature's majesty of forms The eye entrance, where admiration glows, Because, though mute, those forms to fancy hint A soul in matter and a speech in things,— And earth's own laureates be unreverenced By mind? The human Race their debtor is; Sea, air, and mountain, lake and lonely shore, Forests and woods, and fields where freshness blooms All are immortalised by radiance cast From their high meanings, who the world transform, And cast a beauty round the common lot By making loveliness more lovely still. A mental prophet and a priest of song The bard of Rydal is to Souls who see How heaven-born genius, like a mouth of God, Opens some new apocalypse of Power Which faith reveres, and meditation loves. For have not Nature, Providence, and Man Of both the centre, from his thoughtful muse A sympathy of mild and mournful tone Partaken, till Association's law Have each invested with a beauteous charm? Thus, mountain-grandeur and the grace of hills Like thine, Helvellyn! in their hollow sweep; Or forked Skiddaw with his famous brow; Parnassean groves and glades of blissful calm Where trees their twilight cast,—to him were dear And with his being half incorporate grew. The thorn had meanings; and a thistle spoke Its own stern language; while each meadow-flower A glow of beauty on creation's brow In blooming radiance, seem'd by Angels dropt: Nature to him was one almighty Speech Significant, and deep, and full of God. Nothing was lost, but all to love appeal'd, The linnet's chaunt, a homeless cuckoo-song, An eagle's majesty, or insect-mirth To him were welcome, and some feeling touch'd. All voices, visions, all of sense and sound Home to his heart a deep impression sent Which gave him partnership in nature's All, As though 'twere conscious. Hence the landscapes were An outward-token of the inward mind, Loved in his life, and from the Spirit's lyre Drew melodies of thought, which shall not die While throbs the heart with poetry or prayer! Not mere description, pensive, deep or grand, His verse unfolds: but he the Mind has taught How nature's sacraments and symbols speak To mental reverence with a language mute But mighty; how Her moods and motions are Responsively to Man's more hidden world With such accordance shaped, that heaven-born minds See God and Angels, where a sensuous heart Is charm'd by nothing but material show. And human Life, and Providential love To man reveal'd by Omnipresent acts Of watching tenderness, from heaven at work, His numbers prove with philosophic grace And wisdom most benign. To him the scene Of dark Existence was divinely touch'd With sacredness and awe; whence prayer and praise Were due, and godless Pride should learn to think, And none seem orphan'd from the Father-God! For as in nature, nothing is by Heaven Forgotten, from the vaster forms of Life And Being, down to each minutest speck, But in the beam of God's parental eye Remains for ever,—so that social World Where Mind and Will their awfulness unfold And character is moulded, to his gaze An order'd scene of theocratic Law Presented, where enthroned, the Godhead reign'd And all were precious, who His cause maintain,— Possible Angels, whom The Christ redeem'd. All Nature thus made spiritually deep By her significance of conscious life To Soul responsive, and the moral World, Where Providence to human will conjoins Each plan and purpose, being hence enlink'd With Glories uncreate,—no wonder Man A true schekinah of transcendant powers To Wordsworth seem'd; a Soul of priceless cost, Whose incarnation, in its meanest guise, Involves more grandeur than the “Worlds” contain! Earth, space, and time, and all which tinsell'd pride Amid the pageantries of wealth pursues Or mere Convention by dull creed exacts Before it vanish'd!—Individual mind To him became the summit of his song: And, how he trembled into wordless prayer And grew religious, when unfathom'd depths Of man's capacity for bliss or woe Were open'd, and on Faith's predictive eye The soul's hereafter like a vision rose Self-realised, for heaven, or hell prepared! FORTY LINES ON WELLINGTON. I Though shaded by death, yet his glory remains Like beams on the billow when day-light is set; And deeper than language the sorrow that pains The heart of a Nation, enshrining him yet. II Oh! his was a greatness the good can admire, Which Virtue may laurel, and Vice only dread; And pure as the principles Truth can inspire The wreath of renown which encircles his head. III From peasant to peer, from the cot to the throne The thrills of dejection pervadingly ran, When the myriad-wing'd Press to Europe made known The death of a leader in Liberty's van. IV The soar of an eagle when sweeping its flight, The heart of a lion which throbs o'er his prey, But weakly can image the worth and the might Of Wellington marching in battle-array. V Resistless in conflict, but simple and stern, Serene in the tempest, and calm in the shock, Let the valour of Youth thus patiently learn When the whirlwind is raving,—to rival the rock! VI A Cæsar in battle, and Cato at home, Protecting our Altars from infidel-hate, We challenge the records of haughty old Rome To boast of a Hero so gallant and great. VII When the war-hounds of France in horrors of blood Had raven'd on Freedom, and outraged her laws, The bulwark of Empires, brave Wellington stood, And stifled Rebellion by quenching her cause. VIII Thus, onward he triumphs in prowess and pride, A king of all subjects, yet subject to kings; Till the banners of England wave out far and wide And Earth o'er her ransom with jubilee rings. IX A pillar of Patriots, the foremost and first, Erect in his grandeur of spirit and zeal Ambition ne'er saw him, by self-aims accurst, Pursue the bad triumphs we blush to reveal. X Then, deepen for ever the homage and praise From past and from present, to Wellington due, And hallow the glory which brightens the bays He won for Mankind, when he gain'd Waterloo. “BETTER DAYS.” “All our pleasant things are laid waste.” Isa. lxiv. 11. “Remember the days of old.”—Deut. xxxii. 7. How eloquent the ruin'd shrine August, or sad, or lowly! 'Tis haunted with a spell divine Deeper than melancholy: For still it breathes of poetry and prayer, And mild dejection woos Religion there. Temples, and tombs, and cities vast, The roofless cot, or home O'er which Destruction's wings have past, And where pale memories roam, How are we moved by their mysterious sway And lulling sadness of severe decay? Strange though it seem, not royal state, Nor brilliant pomp and pride Encircled round the earth-born great To rank and wealth allied, Attract the spirit with so true a power As wreck and ruins in some pensive hour. Engirdled are they by a spell, A wordless charm of mind, And something more than tones can tell Sinks o'er the soul refined, When the dead glories of departed Years Moisten the eye with meditation's tears. But, what are we, but wrecks of man, A fallen race of sin, Creatures who marr'd the Almighty plan And let rebellion in, Through that pure Will which Heaven created free, Whose law was Love, and that was Deity. And thus, perchance, for ruin'd Things Our moral instinct wakes, And o'er the heart's electric strings A breath from Eden breaks,— A mournful sense of forfeit-bloom and bowers When Eve was perfect as the vestal flowers. But if o'er what is dumb and dead, A palace, shrine, or cot, The tears of History are shed And sanctify the spot Where genius wept, or wisdom thrill'd and thought, The martyr burn'd, or heroes bled and fought, Shall not a living wreck of love, An orphan sad and lone,— Children whose angels stand above So near the Glory-throne, Soften the heart when sounds the touching phrase, Heard in some homely tale of “Better Days?” It is, indeed, a moving sight! A pale and pensive child Whose brow enthrones no young delight; As though it ne'er had smiled; Friendless and homeless, with dejected face Too early touch'd with sorrow's withering trace. Around it once fond parents hung With love's enamour'd eye; And Age itself again grew young With that bright creature nigh! Pangless the heart, the step was like the breeze In bounding gladness borne above the seas. Wealth, home and peace were there combined To make that child secure; And all which moulded heart and mind Was radiant, sweet and pure: Soft Innocence unveil'd her beauteous smile And childhood flourish'd free from want and guile. Prophetic dreams must oft have play'd Around its virgin morn, Ere baffled circumstance betray'd A lot now bleak and lorn: The future seem'd the poesy of life Read by a heart with golden fancies rife. But all is wither'd, changed and gone, Friend, home and fortune o'er! And hard-eyed worldlings cease to own The wreck of wealth no more; That once gay child is now a gloomy Thing Wan with disease, or worn by suffering. Blessings divine, then, hallow those Who sheltering mansions build To anchor from tempestuous woes Children, whose hearts are fill'd By past remembrance, blent with present grief, Where life seems darkness, waiting death's relief! Never till Christ unveils His throne Whose heart beats human there, And echoes to each plaintive tone Breathed in the sigh, a prayer,— Will the vast mercy these Asylums prove Be understood, except by boundless love. Long may they flourish! like the shrine, St. Ann's of regal name; Where better days, with love combine To form a noble claim For pleading orphans, and the helpless poor In whom Christ owns His lot repeated o'er. ENGLISH PEASANTRY. (1826.) Behold our peasantry! Britannia's pride While baleful Luxury her boon denied; The tyrant grasp of Desolation spoils Each homely shelter for the labourer's toils; While sad and far the houseless peasant flies And mansions o'er his ruin'd hamlet rise: For him no more shall bloom the garden flower, No sabbath guest shall greet his hazel bower, No winter's evening bring domestic bliss, No laughing infants leap to share the kiss. Inhuman Tyrants! whose destructive hand, To grasp domain would desolate the Land; Can barren pomp one joyous hour bestow While Famine fills a thousand hearts with wo? Can palisadoed lawns of wide extent Please like the rural homes of calm Content? Sweeter by far, methinks, were Wealth to pour Diffusive blessings from her ample door; And if the sick man pined, to visit there And with the smile of Mercy, hush despair. And dear the scene that charm'd the pilgrim's eye Ere Luxury rose, or Avarice peal'd her cry, Where cottage-homes, upon the green domain Gave health and shelter to the toiling swain: There many a way-worn traveller sighing stay'd, And ask'd of heaven some equal hamlet-shade Where humble life flow'd undisturb'd away, And happiness led on each new-born Day. The smoke enwreathing with the playful breeze, A glowing produce ripening on the trees, The laden bee low-humming in some flower, Or pigeon cooing from his shaded tower, With all the nameless charms that nestle round The cottage-garden and the pasture-ground,— Made every passing stranger stop awhile And lit his lingering eye with many a smile! Here was the home, where toil-worn age, at last Might rest secure, and muse on labours past; Here was the welcome round of rustic mirth, The family-supper, and the blazing hearth, The happy converse, and the cheerful gaze, With all that Gratitude to Mercy pays! Rare now a scene so simply pure as this,— The quiet plenty and the cottage-bliss! Oppressive Wealth usurps each lawny spot Where bloom'd the garden and where rose the cot; Mansions, and groves, and princely parks abound, Stretch o'er the plain, and seize each rood of ground, While Pomp frowns every meaner home away And leaves the peasant but a scanty pay; Doom'd through the day to bear the summer-blaze, Or mend, 'mid ice and snow, the public ways; Or else, beneath the bleak autumnal-showers, In damp and pain to pass the tedious hours, A pittance from the tyrant of the soil Is all which pays him for his dismal toil: Then, home he wanders to a cheerless shed With discontented heart, and aching head: Here shall no rosy babes, nor smiling wife, Attend to make the sweetnesses of life; No social case to keep the mind in tune And shed delight around life's waning noon; But starving infants with imploring eyes Raising their pallid hands and piteous cries, Till agony distract the parent's brain, Flame the wild thought, or rack the soul with pain; Till Want burst every tie of virtue free; And Crime conducts him to the gallows-tree! STARLIGHT ON MARATHON. No vesper-breeze is floating now, No murmurs shake the air; A gloom hath veil'd yon mountain-brow And quietude is there; While night-beads on the dew-white grass Drop brilliant as my footsteps pass. No hum of life disturbs the scene, The clouds are roll'd to rest; 'Tis like a calm where grief hath been,— So welcome to the breast! The warring tones of Day are gone And starlight gleams on Marathon. I look around from earth to sky And gaze from star to star; Till Grecian hosts seem gliding by Triumphant from the war: Like deathless spirits from the dead Revisiting where once they bled. What though the mounds which mark'd each name Beneath the wings of time Have worn away,—theirs is the fame Immortal and sublime: For who can tread on Freedom's plain Nor wake Her dead to life again! Oh! to have seen the marching Bands, And heard the battle-clash, Have seen their weapon-clenching hands And eyes' defiant flash, Their radiant shields and dancing crests And corslets on their swelling breasts! Then said the mother to her son And pointed to his shield, “Come with it, when the battle's done Or on it, from the field!” Then mute she fix'd her dreadless eye That spoke of ages vanish'd by. 'Twas here they fought: and martial peals Once thunder'd o'er the ground, While gash and wound from plunging steels Bedew'd the battle-mound; Here Grecians trod the Persian dead, And Freedom shouted while she bled! But, gone the day of Freedom's sword And cold the patriot brave, Whose valour crush'd the servile horde Like victims for the grave; While Greece arose sublimely free And dauntless as her own dark sea! Yet, starlight sheds a pallid beam For aye upon the plain; And musing breasts might fondly dream The Grecian free again; For empires fall, and freedom dies, But changeless beauty robes the skies. May He whose glory veils yon sky, God of the slave and free! Hear every patriot's burning sigh Hope dedicates to thee; For thee, sad Greece! and every son Who braves a Turk on Marathon. LONDON BY MIDNIGHT. (1828.) The fret and fever of the day subside, And London slumbers; but with murmurs faint Like Ocean, when she folds her waves to sleep: 'Tis the pure hour for poetry and thought, When passions sink, and Faith the heaven beholds, As yearns an exile for his father-land. O'er all a dim sublimity is spread,— The garniture of night; amid the air Darkly and drear yon airy steeples rise, Like shadows of the past; the houses lie In dismal clusters, moveless as in sleep; And, towering far above the rest, yon Dome Appears, as if self-balanced in the gloom,— A spectre cowering o'er the dusky piles. And, see! on ground I stand whose glorious name Might turn the coward brave; on thy huge bridge Triumphant Waterloo! Above,—how calm! There moon and star commingling radiance shed And bathe the skies in beauty. Smooth and pale The pearly bosom'd clouds recline, enlink'd Like wave-festoons upon the furrow'd deep. Below, the Thames outspread, serene and cold; And as I gaze, a cooling breath ascends And melts upon my brow: like the worn heart When harrowing cares have slept, the river seems Peaceful and still; save when a wind-sigh wakes The brooding slumbers of its breast; like dreams That quiver on the marble face of Sleep. Along each side the darkling mansions frown Funereal in their gloom. Afar and faint, The bridge-lamps glimmer o'er the tranquil stream, As if enchain'd upon the air; beneath, Gleams of pale lustre tremble through the gloom; And, here and there, a tower and shadowy spire Are imaged on the water; sad and shrunk Like flower-leaves wither'd by the summer-blaze. Yonder, in dim magnificence, behold The many window'd Pile; apart and stern, In lowering grandeur, like a lofty mind Unmingling with the baser crowd. One half Is clothed with moonlight's pallid veil; Beneath, a darkness broods, whence portals yawn In cavern-gloom upon the drowsy tide, Like tombs unbarr'd. But hark! from yonder Dome Into Eternity the Day is toll'd: How hollow, dread, and dismal is the peal To heaven its vast account now rolling up! Awhile it undulates, then dies away In mutter'd echoes, like the ebbing groans Of drowning men; and see! the lustrous Moon Veils her white brow, and leaves me in night-shade, Unseen, but by the sleepless One: O God! I feel thine eye upon me, I shrink Awe-smote beneath its gaze, like melting snow By moon-beams touch'd, when golden radiance smiles. How noiseless are the streets! A few hours gone, And all was fierce commotion; car and hoof, And bickering wheel, and chariot-rush, and crowds Which rang with revelry and woe, were here, Immingled with the stir of life; but now A deadness mantles round the midnight scene; Time with his awful wand the world has touch'd, And soothed her myriads into sleep!—'Tis hush'd! Save when a distant drowsy watch-call breaks Intrusive on the calm; or rapid cars That roll them into silence. Beauteous look The train of houses yellow'd by the moon, Whose tile-roofs, slanting down amid the light, Gleam like an azure track of waveless sea! But who was she, that with a fairy step And lip of wreathing smiles, came floating by Buoyant as April's breeze? Alas! alas! Let nights of laughing agony, and crimes Which burn their torture through the sullied heart, Let sated passion and the form consumed, Let these betray the orphan of the night! As on her guilt-worn face a lamp-beam fell, Reluctantly methought, her eye reveal'd That curse of misery—gladness in disguise! The squares, how haughtily reposed they stand At this deep hour, with massy piles erect And stately! where the windows broad and bright, Like molten water shine; and freckled walls In light are steep'd, which ripples on the stone; Beneath, amid the laurel boughs that bend Responsive to the breeze, the lamp-rays flit In twinkling playfulness, like infant-eyes. Once more upon the climbing moon, ere yet Cloud-shaded she withdraw, a moment glance! There, as we gaze, what undefinèd awe, What thoughts ethereal flutter round the heart! On Her fair brow we seem to write and read The mind's quick fancies; all the Past awakes Begirt with sweet creations, till the source Of sympathy unlocks; and then a tear Will venture brightly from the manliest eye,— A precious tear, whose fountain is the soul. The past,—Oh! who through London-streets can pace, Nor vision forth the spirits which have been? An atmosphere of genius quickens here Remembrance of the dead! The storied nurse, The ancient mother of the mighty, thou Unrivall'd London! Sages, poets, kings, And all the giant-race of glorious fame Whose world-illuming minds, like quenchless stars Burn through the night of ages,—triumph'd here, Or martyrdom of mind endured! And now Those Kings of mind, by death immortal made, Forth from their tombs Imagination cites! And who the midnight-scenes of life shall paint, In this vast city, mart of human-kind! In sleep some living wrecks of wo, are lapp'd, And bless'd in dreams, whose daylight was a curse! Some, heart-rack'd, on the sleepless couch recline, And from the heated brain create a hell Of agonising thoughts or ghastly fears; While Pleasure's moths amid the golden sheen Of princely halls, dance off the dull-wing'd hours; And oh! perchance, in some infectious cell Far from his home, unaided and unsoothed, The famish'd wand'rer dies;—no voice to breathe Mild comfort to his heart; no hand to smooth His bed of death; no sainted eye to bless The spirit hovering o'er another world! But list! a laugh of Pleasure thrills the wind; 'Tis Folly's soulless idols sauntering home, Faced with a mask of smiles. And One there is, Upon whose haggard cheek a glance may read A tale of blighted years and buried woes! His home is reach'd; and where yon window-gleams Dart o'er the street a dizzy chain of light Awhile he gazes on his mirror'd face, And sighs to mark what havoc Pleasure makes! Then drops upon his couch, while round him float In visionary throng, the glowing forms Which beautified the night; and where are they?— At home, heart-wearied, wilder'd as their dreams And glad that Time another day has kill'd! Turn to a nobler victim of the night: Where yonder casement sheds a pallid gleam Upon the breezeless air, aloft and lone An unregarded wreck of Genius toils, With throbbing brain and dewy brow. The Day To rest hath gone: but slumber visits not His sunken eyes! The gnawing fires of thought Upon his youthful cheek have fed, and parch'd His tongue, and from his lip drawn the life-stream; The lightnings of the soul his form have seared. But Fame stands beckoning; and he battles on Through want and wo, until he win the goal,— A welcome one, though Death should drag him there! And shall this City-queen, this peerless mass Of pillar'd fanes, and grey-worn towers sublime, Be blotted from the world, and forests wave Where once a second Rome was seen? Oh! say, Shall rude grass cover England's royal streets, And wild beasts howl where Commerce reign'd supreme? Alas! her moral glance let Memory dart Down vanish'd time, till summon'd Ages rise With ruin'd empires on their wings! Thought weeps With patriot-truth, to own a funeral day Heart of the universe! may visit thee, When round thy wreck some lonely man shall roam, And, musing, say,—“'Twas here vast London stood!” But hark! again the heavy bell has peal'd Its doleful thunder; on their watch the Stars Grow pale; the Moon seems wearied of her course; And morn begins to blossom in the east; Then, let me home; and Heaven my thoughts protect! PAINS OF GENIUS. Envy not the Poet's name, Darken not his dawn of fame; 'Tis the guerdon of a mind Free from thralls of earthly kind; 'Tis the fascinating Star Brighter than the brightest far; It often glitters o'er his doom, A halo round an early tomb! The whirling brain and heated brow, The dreams which torture while they grow The soaring fancy over-fraught; The burning agonies of thought; The sleepless eye and racking head, The haunting terrors round him spread: Or freezing smile of Apathy; Or scowl of green-eyed Jealousy; Or haggard Want, whose lean hands wave Unto a cold uncover'd grave!— Oh! these must win a Poet's name; Then darken not his dawn of fame. THE CATARACT. In slumber, when some dream of daring night Transcends creation, or out-dazzles earth, Man's wither'd paradise may seem revived; And oft when Poesy and young Romance Imagination's throne together mount,— What landscapes, fit for Seraphim to walk, In the green loveliness of Nature's youth Beneath their fascinating smile have bloom'd! And yet, no dreaming pomp nor bardic spell Can rival thee, by God himself array'd With glory terrible, and beauty wild, Thou earth-adorning Cataract!—once seen, And seen for ever: heard by sense for once, And in the spirit heard for evermore! When, like some vision of a ruin'd world, In foaming majesty I saw thee fall From crag to crag terrifically swift, My soul was hush'd, in trance of wonder bound; A word was outrage! mute as thought, I gazed Upon thee, vanquish'd by the dread sublime: As in the presence of Almighty spells, My being trembled: language was extinct! Aloft, aloft, precipitate and loud, The plunging torrent like a war-horse leaps Adown the black ravine! and white with rage And thunderingly hoarse, the headlong-wave From rock to rock in froth and foam careers, In tameless terrible, unwearied ire For ever raving! Hark! the mountain thrills And throbs, the leaflets palpitate with awe; The branches quiver like the limbs of fear On each grey elm; while, floating like the breath Of conscious being, lo! the mist ascends In tremor from yon panting surge below, Lingers awhile, in airy balance hung, Then trembles downward with a quavering fall In rain-drops delicate as tears unshed. King of stern waterfalls! thine awe pervades And like the genius of romance creates A spirit of enchantment round thy home: The valley, hush'd as Desolation, loves; The gloom chaotic of thine ancient hills Torn by the tempest's savage wing, and deck'd With foliage, touch'd by autumn's pale decay; And drip of water, from the rocks dissolved In feeble music, faint as dream-heard sighs,— All these in one vast sentiment unite Around thee, making sight and sound appeal Like poetry, from Nature's heart evoked. And while, with contemplation's spell-bound eyes, Amid the spray, the thunder and the din, Monarch of Waters! upon thee I gazed, The witchery of deep association rose.— On myriads, now in earth and darkness mute, I ponder'd, who, like me, had feasted soul And sense, and drank emotions rich as mine From thine enchantment. Here the worldling came And left, perchance, his worldliness behind; Here Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and Hate, Those Demons of the mind, their sceptres broke, And shrunk, like Satan from the Saviour's word, By thee o'erawed! and here the Poet dreamt While sentiment and thought his heart o'er-whelm'd With magic potency, till he became Sublime in thy sublimity of scene! And from the centre of his spirit felt Warm inspiration, like a sunrise, break, And meanings, full of worldless beauty, flow. Farewell! thou roaring flood of Scynfa born, In loud monotony of roaring ire Rage on for ever! rule all hearts and eyes Which bow before thee: Teacher of the wild And wondrous! may thy voice eternal be, And speak of HIM Whose Shadow is the sun, Whom torrent, sea, and tempest loudly praise; Whose Love by every breeze is syllabled While, seated on Eternity's vast throne, He wields His sceptre o'er ten thousand worlds! Farewell! thou glory of a glorious Clime, Farewell, the sight, but not farewell the sense Of thee:—since in the core of memory's heart The true dominion of thy scene will dwell; And oft amid the dust of daily Life, Or prose of dry existence, will beget Sensations high, and feelings nobly-pure: Or, wafted back on fancy's sun-bright wing, My soul will visit thee, and hear again The thundering harmonies of thy dread stream, Like a huge wave in endless plunge and roar, And own the Almighty by His work revealed! VALE OF CLWYD. Majestic Land of liberty and song, And bardic fame and soul-exciting tales, Of feudal glory! clime of old romance, Whose records make the heart of History bound, A stranger greets thee with exulting pride, And grows a Cambrian; while thy woods and waves Rouse the full voice of unaffected song.— Poets are Nature's patriots; sea and sky, Mountain and rock, and wood-hung vales and hills, Deep glens, or lakes, and thunder-mocking cataracts Round them appear like Inspiration's home. Thy tower, St. Asaph! when the noon-bright heaven With crystal arch o'er-canopied thy walls And the breeze caroll'd like a bird of air, I trod; beneath me, Arcady revived Burst on the wonder of my ravish'd eye! Painting ne'er form'd, nor poetry conceived A paradise of more bewitching scene: Leftward the river'd Vale of Cluid lay Magnificent, with woods and trees adorn'd; Where castled halls and princely mansions stood, And towns remote, and cots, and hamlet-spires, With white-faced homes in blossom'd trees embower'd, 'Mid meadows greenly-bright, and mountain-forms Whose wavy outline on the sky was mapp'd,— All on the gaze a mass of beauty pour'd Beyond what Pòussin in Italian dreams described! In calm sublimity of conscious strength The Hills reposed; but when some cloudy shade Form'd into life, a floating semblance fell With dim surprisal on their meadow'd sides, And chequer'd them with ever-changing hue. Bright ran the river, with melodious speed Contented; fit for fairy barks to sail, Or Infancy beside its banks to roam And gaily prattle to the new-blown flowers,— So timidly the modest waters flow'd: And yet, when rains and mountain-floods descend, The demon-spirit of the water frowns! In roaring swiftness o'er the prostrate fields The exaggerated river foams along, And ruins as it rolls! like some proud mind That when unwrong'd in meek retirement dwells, But, injured,—how the buried fire outbreaks, And maddens round it withering and fierce! Upon my right, in ivy-tress'd array, Sublime in ruin, Rhyddlan Castle frown'd; And, gazing there, the heart religious grew, To think how glory, pomp, and all the world adores, A dream becomes for moralist to scan! Home of the Warrior! where the banner waved, And Towers! where Cambrian kings and chieftains reign'd, Whose halls within, the harp of Cymru rang, While melodies, from Freedom's soul evoked Pour'd tides of feeling over Princes' hearts, In thy decay how eloquent thou stand'st! Gigantic Emblem for the mind to read How perishing is glory! while the Sea In loud eternity of water beats Grandly as ever on thy throbbing shore. From thee, dread Monument of vanish'd days, Baronial relic of the fierce and free, Mine eye retreated; far as sight could roam, Pictured on clouds, in outlined magic lay The Peaks of Snowdon; silver-bright they shone, And seem'd the very walls of Heaven! so fair, So dazzling-white their towering beauty rose, Like sculpture out of snow by sunshine carved. Stranger! if ever pent in cities loud, For many a month thy yearning eye has dream'd Of Nature, throned amid the green romance Of woods and waterfalls, thy heart might beat In thrilling answer to the strain I sing, Hadst thou beside me, from the sacred tower This beauteous Vale beheld:—or ere I left, One long, enamour'd, and delicious gaze It bade me fasten on the faultless scene; The sunshine in its golden lull reposed On tree and mountain: cot and castle gleam'd, And field and flower their blending graces show'd; But when the breeze, in wingèd life arose, How richly all the stirring Landscape flamed! 'Till the glad meads like emerald-sunshine flash'd, So lustrously that living verdure play'd! Soft be the winds that visit thy domain And fair the flowers which gem thy matchless vale St. Asaph! long may yon cathedral-tower A sanctity around thy region shed! For never, while a pulse of memory beats, Can I that hour of thrilling awe forget When first amid the gazing crowd I knelt, A white-robed Novice; while with trembling lip And soul that to its centre shook, and pray'd, I vow'd to feed and watch the fold of Christ! Vale of calm beauty! peace be ever thine And plenteousness within thy cottage-homes, Thy castled halls: when fateful years have fled And worn the furrow deeper on my brow, Vision'd by fancy, thou wilt yet remain And help to form imagination's heaven! ELLESMERE LAKE. (1836.) Calm as the beauty upon childhood's brow On whose fair arch young tenderness is throned, The Lake reposes; not a ripple mars Its cloud-reflecting face; where hues of heaven In soft variety of liquid smiles Float o'er the water, in successive play Of light and motion, exquisitely wild. Oh! Nature, art thou not a spirit now, While the rich poetry of silence reigns Heard by the soul, which feels almost unearth'd And girded round by inspiration's spell? Pale Martyr of the feverish thought and care! Sad Victim of a spirit-crushing world! And Thou, who, dungeon'd in the gloom of self, To thine imprison'd view art dwarfing down All grand conceptions, all august desires, Hither! and while the dreaming water basks Beneath the play of noon's attemper'd smile, Lull'd in a trance of thought, the Lake admire. Above, the curved immensity of heaven Attracts thee, making eye and heart ascend To wander in those palaces of cloud, Or fairy-chambers, by the sunbeams paved. And ye! vast Hills, that in your towering pomp Touch the bow'd sky, and belt the horizon round With guardian might, how lofty and alone, In stern supremacy of height and shape Ye stand! And, gazing on your giant-forms, The charm'd beholder grows exalted too, Till wing'd emotions waft the mind aloft And, mountain-like, from earth to heaven he soars! But, hark! in gushes of unwearied song From yon green isle the hidden birds outpour Their ecstasy of voice; and round them flows An atmosphere of melody and praise; While here and there, some fairy insect-form Floats on the air, and fans its playful wing; Or butterflies, like soaring gems, abound, And scatter forth their gleams of dazzling joy! But, see! where Oteley with its terraced pomp And sun-bright aspect through the foliage smiles Imposingly serene; Oh! long around That Home of hospitality and peace May all the social graces throng and bloom! And you, that gently on the lake encroach Or round the shore a verdant twilight cast, Majestic Trees! by summer-grace bedeck'd, How lovingly your green array invites The pausing Eye, while many-coloured leaves Flash in the sun with fascinating hue. And list, in undulating cadence rolls The peal of bells from yonder gothic Shrine Most venerably grey, as broad and dim Through the bright air its dusky tower ascends; While soft vibrations of the sacred chime Ebb on the breeze;—and tenderly, of days Now sepulchred in memory's tomb, they speak, Till the fine chords of quick reflection thrill And waken to the tones. That fane beneath The dust of immemorial thousands sleeps, Who once along the churchyard's haunted ground Did ramble oft, and hear with soul unmoved The very hymn that like a funeral dirge The passing hour bemoans; or saw, perchance, The sunbeams gambolling round their destined grave! But now, mild eve advances, and the Lake More winning tenderness of hue and sound Begins to gather: beautiful delight Art Thou, fair Scene of water! in thy calm, As thus reclining; yet in sterner mood There are who love thine eloquent harangue Of tempest-voices, when the black-wing'd Storms Revel above thee; and in sea-like rage Thy tossing billows whiten, heave, and roar Beneath the glances of uncertain light, That downward in their arrowy fleetness dart From the torn clouds, which let the sun-flash through. Adieu, loved scene of meditative joy; Yet, oh! how lingeringly the eye retires From beauty fresh as thine! The world forgot, And all its crowd of pale-faced cares repell'd, In heavenliness of thought my heart has roam'd Beside thy magic, drinking in awhile The balm and freshness of a better world; While Nature on the throne of feeling sits, And reigns, accorded queen of heart and soul! Farewell! to outward gaze a long farewell, Perchance, for ever: yet the dreaming eye Of Fancy, when the landscapes of the soul Are imaged, often o'er thy charms will bend; And pure sensations into life will flow Of loveliness and verdure; while the tones Of rippling water throb on Memory's ear, Like those that warble round thy grassy shore. Oh! that the heart of man would more and more Hold converse with the Beautiful and Bright, And hear those oracles of truth and love Which come from Nature's everlasting shrine To all who seek Her, and with filial awe Her sanctities admire. And who can tell How often, while along yon wheel-track'd road The hard-eyed worldling in some dream of Self Hath hurried, thou didst breathe a moment's balm On that dry wilderness,—an earthly heart! And thus, amid the blank of common things Thou seemest, in the contrast of thy charm, A page of sentiment by Nature spread In the coarse volume of man's daily Life, The eye to soothe,—or satisfy the heart Which hungers for imagination's feast! But lo! upon the placid brow of Eve A star of glory like a gem is set, And round the air a dreaming quiet broods; While tree and lake in glimmering beauty lie, And the rich shadows of a summer's night Begin to deepen; once again, farewell Thou ancient Water!—centuries o'er thy face Have fleeted, and unnumber'd millions sunk Back into breathless clay, but Thou, unworn, Unwrinkled, and unchanged, art still preserved In youthful glory: thus, while men decay And generations toil, and weep, and die, Some other bard in moralising dream Will muse, perchance, along thy lovely shore, And learn how nature, when the soul responds To fine appeals, can into song awake The music of the heart's mysterious lyre. Ellesmere, June 14th, 1836. ORGAN BOY. He hath a spirit bright in its content And playful in its poverty; the rain Of English clouds and atmospheric gloom Of this brave island-clime have not destroy'd The mirthfulness of his brown cheek; nor quench'd The lustre of those deeply-laughing eyes Which sparkle forth the sunbeams of the soul! Then breathe no pity on the organ-boy; From his gay Land a stock of sterling bliss And proud young feelings that can well out-wear Each frown of Fate, the stripling wanderer brings. Maternal smiles his heart still brighten round; A father's blessing, when he climb'd his knee At night, still sounds upon love's inward ear; And when the streets are wintry, and the tones His organ weaves fall fruitless on the air, He dreams of home deep-bosom'd in bright vales Of beauty; hill-spread vines, and fairy streams That trifled sweetly as a sister's voice Who prattled in her slumber: days will dawn When he again those glowing vales shall thread, And tell his travels with unwearied tongue To fond ones, nestling round his own fireside. Nor think his errant life too mean to sing: Albeit no music tuned to courtly ears, Which seem regardless of those native sounds That raise sweet echoes in romantic souls, From him is heard; there are of meeker taste And simpler mind, who bid the roving boy A welcome; and enchanted hear the notes His organ wakes, of tenderness and truth. As through the City's ever-busy streets And darkly-winding lanes he roams and plays, Many an ear drinks musical delight; Many an eye with beams of vanish'd years Is brightly charged; and from her window haunt, Who makes the street to tingle with the sound Of halfpence, thrown with no ungentle hand, By some fair listener? Haply he woke dreams Of childhood; thoughts which cannot breathe in words, But live and fade in sighs of fond regret! And round him what a throng of urchins group, And dream his music sweet as Orpheus made! The laughter hush'd, the noisy tongue asleep, The hoop, as weary, on his shoulder hung, A Schoolboy stands to listen, and admire Those melodies which dance along his soul Like ripples fleeting o'er a ruffled stream! Then let the streets still waken to the sound Of such boy-minstrels; when afar they roam Through villages, where Music breathes a spell Of magic in her meanest tone, may smiles Of welcome flash along the rough-worn face Of age, and ruddy offspring of the fields: May gentle skies and glowing days attend, And feelings toned to every tuneful hour! There are who deem a Ballad-singer brings No music which rewards harmonious ears; To whom an Organ-boy but grating notes Of discord scatters on the homeless wind; Their sympathies are season'd high, and scorn The gentle: envy not the ungenial souls! For, hallow'd Nature! thou art ever true; And he who wanders with an eye of love And feeling wide among thy many haunts, Through mountain-walks, or unambitious vales, Where stream and meadow mingle their romance Around, in storm and sunshine finds thee still The same and magical! and so, in Life; Her sweet humilities have grace and power Beyond her loftiness and pomp: the Muse Can never play the courtier; from the halls And palaces of Kings she flies to glades Of lowliness, where Faculties are found, And Will and Action can their sway reveal: Where beats a heart, there Poetry may breathe Her spirit round it; beautifying look And word, extracting all the soul of things, And veiling Nature with a hue divine. BALLAD-SINGER. (1829.) “As if the streets were consecrated ground, The city one vast temple—dedicate To mutual respect in thought and deed.” Wordsworth. The dewy spirit of a summer-rain Falls not with fresher magic on the flower Than flows sweet music through the soul of man: In melody the heavens were hung; the Sea Weaves music when she rolls her full-voiced waves: The cloud-born Thunders sound an organ-peal; And every breeze hath music in its breath! What, wonder, then, while Nature hymns around, That music is a sympathy to souls, The power of exquisite delight? From lips Of beauty, like aroma from the mind Exhaling forth; or in the hoary aisle Of dim Cathedrals dying slow away; Or in some dream-built palace of the night, Where angel-whispers make the spirit glow, How sweet is Music!—with the Light twin-born. And thy sad voice, poor Minstrel of the street! Hath sweetness in its sorrow: wild thine air And dim the meaning of that mournful eye; For, blighting Poverty hath made thee droop And worn the health-bloom of thy once fair cheek: Pale-lipp'd thou art; and charity may read Upon thy face the story of thy life; The damp night-gush, the stony bed, the gripe Of famine, and that fever of a soul Whom not a smile hath visited through years Of deep despair, hast thou not felt them, maid Of many sorrows! yet so sweetly flows The tide of music in thy homely song Of tenderness, that when I hear thee sing, As in a vision thou art beautified above Thy lot; and tripping o'er the dew-clad hills When young birds pipe their anthem to the Morn, Like some bright Creature whom the wood-gods love I see thee, in thy youth's elysian prime! That voice, of misery, oh! was it born; Or, breathed by Happiness into thy soul When hand in hand o'er childhood's vanish'd fields Down hawthorn-lanes, by margins of clear brooks And laughing streams, she led thee in her love? With cottage-hymn hast thou not hallow'd oft The sacred hour of eve, and called the smile Of holiness upon thy father's cheek, As flowed his kindled feelings in thy song Of adoration? Minstrel of the street! Whate'er has been thy lot, thy ballads breathe Of summer-days to me; and from each strain My heart can gather echoes, which have wings To bear it downward into Years, where lie The buried Joys that will not bloom again! London, February 14th, 1829. STANZAS FOR MUSIC. When the hush of Twilight deepens Wake, music! then; Or when the star of Hesper glows And flings a beam of pale repose Where yonder tide in beauty flows, Wake, music! then. When the yearning heart is melted Wake, music! then; As oft some dream of perish'd days Comes floating o'er the spirit's gaze 'Till every pulse of memory plays, Wake, music! then. When the cloud of sorrow blackens Wake, music! then; Or, like the hymn of moonlight-bird, Or rain-dew in the desert heard; Or leaflet by a night-breeze stirr'd, Wake, music! then. When the storm of pain arises Wake, music! then; Like glory from an angel-eye, Like pity in a parent-sigh, In feeling softness tenderly Wake, music! then. SUMMER WAVES. Exulting waters! how ye leap and laugh, Instinct with rapture; while the restless beams Of sunlight flash in sympathetic glee O'er your glad bosom: hark! the hurried tones Of sea-born music thrill the Air with mirth, Till all around me, like a viewless swarm Of bees, the humming atmosphere resounds. Strand on Green, Kew, Sept. 1834. MARIUS. (1827.) Sad on the echoing shore great Màrius mused, Deserted and alone; his harass'd eye The crested waves cast sullenly athwart, Where rode the traitor's bark. How fallen now Since that proud day when triumph fired his eye, And Rome beheld her valorous saviour there! To brighter days his dreams went back. He thought Of that high morn, when, fronting Scipio's view, With firm-paced step, and unretreating arm, The foe he dash'd, and dragg'd him in the dust: Of Rome's acclaim, when, throned upon his car, Jugurtha's fetters clanking on his ear, He moved triumphant, 'mid the banner'd throng Who hail'd his Afric conquest: prouder still, His memory hover'd round the laurell'd pile Heap'd from the spoil'd Ambrones;—torch in hand, And purple-clad, as veterans round him stood He waved and whirl'd the blazing light to heaven, While shields, and clashing spears, rang martial joy. Of these he thought, and then Despair awoke, And delved a frown upon his war-worn brow, That bent with recollections dark and deep. Thus Marius sat; and mused before the sea; Till, bursting from his shroud of grief and gloom, O'er bogs and wilds dejectedly he sought A shelter from his foes. Unto the fens With wild and weary step the wanderer came, And found compassion in a cotter's hut: Roused thence, he couch'd within a narrow cave, Beside the river; there was Marius ta'en, And naked dragg'd unto Minturnæ's walls! Within a cell, whose dungeon-wall shed round A dreadful gloom, the imprison'd Warrior lay, Stern, fierce, and frowning, dubious of his fate Like a chain'd eagle glaring at the skies! The door burst open; and with clattering teeth, And hand which trembled like a dizzy flame, Stalk'd in a savage Gaul; but, ere he sheath'd His gleaming dagger in a Roman breast, From his fierce eyes a living flame there flash'd, Like lightning from a cloud! Th' assassin shook And reel'd, and shrunk affrighted from dread eyes Whose flashes fell like phantom-darts of fire, On that pale coward's face. Then Marius rose And, with a voice of thunder, loud and deep, “Darest thou do the murderous deed!” exclaim'd. VIVE L'EMPEREUR! (1827.) By Wilid's banks the headlong river swept Like whirlwind for its havoc! white with foam, And plunging on in many a gurgled roar Of furious rage! So fiercely flies the steed, Unmanacled, that with his upshot ears, And limbs vein-swelling in their wrathful glow, Undaunted gallops over hill and dale With name dishevell'd and his eyes on fire. Each massy bridge was ruin'd; and afar The giddy wrecks were battling with the flood Till whirl'd below. 'Twas then Napoleon came With his embattled hosts. That wondrous Man! Whose daring spirit, with volcanic rage, Breathed flame and ruin on the affrighted world. His eyes the universe could span! His soul Had fire enough to vanquish all! In vain Wild Nature barr'd his progress with her crags O'er-crested by the clouds; in vain the rocks His path to block, their icy heads uprear'd Or hurl'd their torrents at him! With a glance Fierce as the eagle's, when his piercing eye Gleams through the darkening air, he look'd beyond Them all: Nature and He were giants twin, And her impediments but forced the flames Of genius from his soul; as thunder-clouds Together clash'd, their lightning-gleams dart forth. Upon the howling flood a glance he threw, Such as the tiger darts, ere on his prey He springs, to gnash it in his ravening ire; Then fiercely cried “On! on! my valiant Poles!” They answered not; but with a clanging stir Goaded their pawing battle-steeds, and plunged Amid the torrent's rush. Like loosen'd crags Down-rushing on the sea, the warriors sank Emburied in the stream; then buoy'd again, And panting, cleaved their roaring track. Beneath Their gallant burdens, bravely paw'd the steeds, With blowing nostrils and dilated eyes, And many a furious snort; against their breasts The cloven waters foam'd, and flash'd behind Their darting hoofs; and roar'd, and raged around The dripping foemen, like a startled den Of lions in the wood:—but vain the rush; Midway the maddening torrent overwhelm'd The struggling files; like a tremendous blast Among autumnal leaves, it scatter'd all! Rank after rank was buried in the flood, Their steeds upon; while round their sinking heads The waters yell'd, as victors o'er their foes: But in that gasp, while yet their spirits hung 'Tween life and death, as feathers in the air, Backward they gazed, and with triumphant shrieks Of valour, fiercely sounded, “Vive l'Empereur!” He heard their death-cries rolling on the blast; And, as a lake just rippled into life, His features flutter'd with terrific throes Of suffering; then, his grinding teeth he gnash'd, And dug the nails into his palms; and groan'd In more than agony, whose deeps were dumb! DEATH OF CORINNE. (1828.) All pale, and pillow'd on a chair she lay, The beautiful, the passionate Corinne! The brilliant language of her eyes no more Darted around such eloquence of soul, As when, amid the crowd, her feelings flash'd The bright expression forth; while she herself Was living poetry! Deep pensiveness, And looks intense which tell the blighted heart, Of coming death prophetically spake! Ere yet her spirit breathed itself to heaven, She yearn'd, upon the shrouded moon to gaze, Silvering the mellow skies. Athwart her face Floated that fatal cloud! the same she saw When Melville woo'd her by the winding shore: On him, enamour'd, kneeling at her feet, She look'd, and in one look condensed The buried anguish of a broken heart; Her white lips feebly parted, then reclosed For ever! Gazing then upon the sky, She faintly beckon'd to the gleaming moon, While down her neck her streaming ringlets fell Like dropping sunbeams on the pallid air. And now a change came on; back the blood retired Her radiant cheek beneath; her eyelids moved Like melting snow-flakes in the noontide-glow, And all her beauty quite empyreal turn'd, As if refining, ere to heaven it went; Her hand fell downward with her farewell sigh, And with eternity her spirit was! CÆSAR ON THE BANKS OF THE RUBICON. (1829.) Amid the roar of revelry Within Alesian's home, He moved with glad but musing eye, The vanquisher of Rome; His spirit mingled with the gay, And smiled the gloom of war away. He tarried there till darkling Night Threw round her dewy veil, And shadows pall'd each Alpine-height That beetled o'er the dale; Then Cæsar rose, his bosom fraught With incommunicable thought! And swiftly sped the Hero on Along his shadowy road; And reach'd where roll'd the Rubicon, That from the mountain flow'd; And there,—prophetic thought's control Becalm'd the dauntless Cæsar's soul! Before him heaved the river-bound Between great Rome and Gaul; If cross'd—what trumpet-clangs would sound! How many a foeman fall! The vision'd future wild with woes Before him, like a Spectre, rose! He mused on battle, war, and blood, On plunder'd cities' storm; The impatient daggers of the good Against a tyrant's form; On all the mountain-perils thrown 'Tween Rome and triumph,—for his own. Of what the unborn Times would say At Rubicon's grand name, Of Him who track'd with blood his way, And with it built his fame: Would he not seem a demon then, Who ravish'd all the rights of men? And thus reflecting Cæsar stood And battled with his mind; Then, gazed upon the fatal flood, And dash'd his doubts behind! Like a bent bow, his pride return'd, And all the Roman in him burn'd. “The die is cast! the die is cast!” With reckless shout he cried; Then swift the Rubicon was pass'd And reach'd the Roman side; Ere day had dawn'd he drew the sword, And vassal Cities hail'd him lord! A THOUGHT. Dreams of our Youth! like birds of beauteous wing Which haunt the paradise of morn and sing, How have ye vanish'd into viewless air And left the mind a Temple for despair! July, 1833. MORNING. (1829.) The Sun is seated on his ocean-throne, Attended by a court of clouds. Around And midway, rosy phantoms form and swell, Advance, and, like battalions in array, Mingle their pomp, and make a shining plain Of crimson on the skies. Beneath, the waves In gleaming motion lie, like ruffled scales Of liquid steel: and, lo! awaking now With the white dew of slumber on her breast, The Earth, all fragrant, fresh in living green, And beautiful, as if this moment sprung From out her Maker's hand. Athwart the trees A verdant lustre shines; where matin-beads With gems of light have jewell'd all the boughs; While here and there, some gently-vocal stream Touch'd by a sun-ray, laughs with conscious light. The Flowers are waking, too, and ope their eyes To greet the prying sun, while meads and dales With hoary incense steam: and list! there floats A buzz of life: myriads of insects now Creep from their green-wood caves and mossy homes, And wind their way to glitter in the sun; While from yon wooded green the sheep-bells send Their tinkling echoes down the forest-dale. And is creation's heir, in slumberous calm Unmindful of the morn? Ah, no: its beams On the lone cotter's straw-roof'd hut hath smiled, And call'd him forth. And see! the lattice oped, Far o'er the landscape's freshen'd view His eye Expatiates; while the choral breezes wake Like matins from the harp of Air produced: And then deep sentiments, by purity evoked, Thrill the true heart; instructively it owns The gloriousness of God; while faith ascends On wings of prayer and praise the Mercy-seat, And Him adores, Whom day and night reveal. NOON. The Sun is burning with his noontide-beams Inflamed to fierceness. Cooling winds are dead; The shallow lakes are film'd; and fetid pools Gleam darkly from the arid ground, while hosts Of swarming insects on the creviced soil Basking and buzzing creep. The trees are tranced In breezeless air; and at their matted trunks The ploughman lies, his head upon his palms, Watching between the leaves heaven's cloudless arch Smile on him beauteously. The flowers decline, As if they languish'd for a breezy draught; And e'en the flirting bee, now honey-cloy'd, Is humming languid on the rose's brim. The world grows faint; and all is stirless, save Yon sky-bird travelling to the sun; and hark! Wing-poised, he peers undazzled at the blaze, Hymning his heart-full of aërial strains. Beneath this towering cliff behold the sea Magnificently spread! The billows pant And revel in the beams, which crest and crown Their heads with golden brightness; or adorn The dimpling bosom of the calmer deep, And gambol to the shore. But, far beyond, Behold a rock majestically rear'd; Upon whose brow the eagle sits at noon, Rolling his eye-balls at the blazing run; High on the yellow beach, its hoary side Is bared unto the ocean, and the breeze Upwafted, like a tight and stately sail When whitening in the glow of heaven. And look! The feathery shapes of far-off sails are seen Alone upon the billows; and like clouds Which glance and tremble on the ocean-brim, Their motion gleams upon the water's breast. NIGHT. Another day is added to the mass Of buried Ages. Lo, the beauteous Moon, Like a fair shepherdess now comes abroad With her full flock of stars, which roam around The azure mead of heaven. And oh, how charm'd Beneath her loveliness creation looks! Far-gleaming hills, and light-inweaving streams, And fragrant boughs with dewy lustre clothed, And green-hair'd valleys, all in glory dress'd, The pageantries of Night compose. One glance Upon old Ocean, where the woven beams Have braided her dark waves!—Their roar is hush'd; Her billowy wings are folded up to rest; Till once again infuriate winds shall yell, And tear them into strife. A lone owl's hoot; The waterfall's faint drip; or insect-stir Among the emerald leaves; or infant-wind Rifling the pearly lips of sleeping flowers,— The stillness of the scene alone disturb: Spirit of All! as up yon star-hung deep Of air, the eye and heart together mount, Man's Immortality within him speaks; That Thou art all around! Thy Beauty walks In dream-heard music o'er the midnight heavens; Thy glory garmenteth the slumbering world. SPIRIT OF TIME. 1830. “Horæ quidem cedunt et dies, et menses, et anni: nec præteritum tempus unquam revertitur; nec quid sequatur, sciri potest.”—Cicero. Another Year, methought a Spirit cried, Another Year is dead! Still rolls the world Magnificent as ever; bright the Sun, And beautiful his native heaven; the Earth Around looks fresh as on her birth-day morn; And Man, as gay as if no knell had rung, No heart been broken, and no tears been shed! Where, then, the history of the buried Year, Of weal and woe, of glory and of shame? Eternal! not a minute fleets away That to Thy throne a record doth not waft; Time cannot die; the unapparent Years Again will rise; and cited Ages come, And in our human resurrection share. A Year hath perish'd, who can tell his tale? Ye Thunders! kings of cloudy wrath sublime, With herald-lightnings to announce your power, Say from your sleep shall ye be summon'd forth, And tell your havoc, in the blaze of noon And in the night-wing'd tempest darkly made? Or, shall I bid unbosom'd Ocean yield Her dead; or let the unfrequented graves Expand, and show their ghastly inmates, there? No moral is there loud enough and deep The laugh of Life to hush above the tomb; Time, accident, and change,—they melt forgot Like clouds of feeling: not the dread alarm, Of Nature can arouse the world to think.— An earthquake was there in a far-off isle: The heavens were blacken'd; and the grim waves yell'd, While Ocean, heaving like a human breast In agony, groan'd wildly from her depths: All Earth seem'd fear-struck; on their bowing trees The leaves hung shuddering; through the heated air The dull wind mutter'd with a spirit-tone, And fitfully the island-cities rock'd: At midnight, came the Earthquake in his ire And gloom, which made the world's foundations reel! Temples and towers were shatter'd: shrieks and prayers Rang in wild tumult through the riven skies; And, crush'd to dust, a thousand corpses lay Gulph'd in the ground and sepulchred by night! Cold morning came; each brow a sadness cloak'd; Yet none of Judgment in their doom could dream, And in the Earthquake hear the Voice of God! A Year hath vanish'd, and how many eyes Are film'd, how many lovely cheeks are cold! What lips, which let out music from the soul, Are death-seal'd, now! Bend, human Pride, and see The desolation and the curse of Time. Monarch of millions! at whose royal feet The treasures of the ransack'd earth were laid, And on whose brow the pride of Ages sat, Where slumberest Thou? the sleep of death is thine; And worms will revel on thy pulseless clay As on the meanest of forgotten dust. What hast thou lost, unheedful World? Thy great Have died; Spirits amid whose radiant track In bright eclipse the common herd are lost: Thy Kings, thy Warriors, and thy Statesmen too Have perish'd: hast Thou mourn'd thy mighty dead? Go, weep for One, the wonder of his day, A mental Titan of amazing grasp, A man whom England may exult to hail Her own; a Patriot, round whose dying lips Her name of glory like enchantment, clung. His chief inheritance, a lofty soul, He battled through the darkness of his lot And shone aloft,—the brightest of them all Who wrestled with the tempest of renown! What genius glow'd that gifted mind within, What eloquence came flowing from the fount Of salient fulness there,—of Hearts demand Which each word felt, like new-born feeling, pour Warm inspiration round them, when with eye That kindled with the kindling truth, he stretch'd His mind o'er Empires; and round captive-isles Bade Liberty her wings of light expand! But, when the mighty die, the mean begin To live; and thus with thee, departed One! Scarce on the wind thy death-knell ceased to moan, Ere darkly rose the pestilential breath Of Slander's venal lip, thy name to blight, And turn thy soul as tainted as her own. Yes! they the thunders of thy voice who fear'd In Retribution's high revenge, arose, And on thy memory heap'd the hoarded wrath Of envy;—let them riot in their shame! What though some error cast a doubtful shade Upon thy glories, shall we laud them less? Are skies less beautiful, because the clouds Sail o'er them? shines the morning sun less bright Because a passing shade his brow profanes?— A monument in noble minds thou hast, That will not moulder; Time shall guard it there! But not alone the glorious and the great Hast thou entomb'd, thou unreturning Year! 'Tis in the noiseless sphere of common life, In placid homes, by quiet evening-hearths Where once the social hearts were gather'd round, We trace a fearful havoc in thy flight. Alas! how many whom the infant Year Beheld in beauty, looking on through life As through a vista of eternal Joy, Have vanish'd, like the bloom of early hope! What blue-eyed babes, the parent knee beside Reflecting smile for smile, have flown away Like birds of Paradise, to their own home! What Creatures, budding into womanhood, The silent walk who loved, and made the flowers Companions of their virgin-thoughts, have gone To graves, with all a mother's treasured hope! Go, see the mournful chamber, where of yore When Winter howl'd his dirge, the gush of song And heart-warm fellowship of feeling hours Was heard, now mute, as if the tones of Joy Had never scatter'd echoes there! Alas! For him, who in the green young spring had wed The Heart he echo'd; brightly laugh'd the Sun Upon that morn of love complete; long days Of bliss, and all the warm romance of youth In radiant vision gather'd round his heart, And now, to him a tomb the world becomes! And thou, dread Fashion, at thy gilded shrine What victims have been offer'd up! From haunts Where all the young Emotions bloom and dwell, And Nature is the holy nurse of Thought, What maiden victims have been brought to thee! And saddening 'twas to see their piteous change From innocence to each corrupting joy: At home they wander'd in ancestral woods, Follow'd the brooks, and felt a kindred ray Flash from their surface o'er the sunny heart; Yes, beautiful that magic reign of soul, When air seem'd haunted with the vocal wings Of spirits, who beatify the winds; Or when, with looks expanded in delight, The heavens they mark'd besprinkled o'er with clouds And beams, and bless'd The Hand which hung them there: Then life was holy, full of heavenward joy, And all their thoughts, like sunbeams, where they fell Shed brightness and a beauty round: oh! ill Exchanged for gilded rooms and crowded halls, For heartless pride and unromantic hours! Then work'd the havoc of the mind within; The fount of generous feeling frozen up, The heart-laugh tamed to an obsequious smile, And young affection slowly wither'd down To bleak and barren pomp,—they died; And heavy knells were rung, when marriage-peals Like merry prophets, should have loudly hail'd The coming years;—'twas Fashion stopt their course! E'en thou, pale Genius! whose unearthly tones The world intrance, within the grave art sunk, Since her dim gates Eternity unbarr'd To let the dead Year in. Yet, one there lived On whom Oblivion's pall should not have dropt Her gloom; he never heard a great Man's name Without a thrill, electric as divine; He never saw a monument to Mind But Glory came, and sat him on her throne. The haughty light I saw, which lit his brow, The emulation from his soul reveal'd And mantling all his features with the mind, When first that ever-haunting dream of Youth, The goal to which ambitious thoughts would run, The City-queen of England,—met his gaze Of wonder. Round him flow'd her streams of life; Temples, and Towers familiar with the clouds, And Streets gigantic, in their glittering flow Branching away like rivers in the sun, Claim'd tributary awe; but soon grew dim: From ancient times a mental shadow came, And in it, his enthusiastic eye Saw Heroes, Lords and Lights of man and mind! But genius to itself a martyr is; And that immortal lava of the soul, That fire he felt for which there is no name, Consumed him, while it glorified each thought: One midnight, when, deserted and untrod, The Capital had lock'd her thousand limbs In slumber, and a silence shrouded all With a cathedral-awe, alone he stood Some mute vast square amid; and deeply watch'd The heavens, and spread his spirit to the stars, That seem'd to brighten as his fancy glow'd! The mystery of Being; and the might Of Him, whose fiat moulded sumless worlds; And Life; and Death; the silence of the grave, That dark Unknown we all are doom'd to know!— Assail'd him now; 'twas his last hour of dreams; The orbs of heaven on him ne'er look'd again, The Morrow saw him shrouded for the grave! No more of sorrow for the fleeted year: No tears can cancel, or recal it now: Hereafter, when before the throne of God Dead Ages shall revive, all its crimes And Virtues will be summon'd to their doom.— Hark! from a host of dimly-vision'd Spires The midnight-hour is rolling to the skies, While doubtful echoes undulate the air, Then glide away, like shadows, into gloom. A solemn peal, a farewell-voice of Time, It leaves a lingering tone in many a heart Where merriment a home had made! The young Who hear it in the festive chamber, sigh, And send their thoughts, sad pilgrims to a tomb; The aged hear it, and the Dead revive! A Year hath vanish'd, and another Year Is born; what awful changes will arise, What dark events lie hidden in the womb Of Time, imagination cannot dream. Ye Heavens! upon whose brow a stillness lies, Deep as the silence of a thinking Heart In its most holy hour, the world hath changed, But ye are changeless; and your midnight-race Of starry Watchers view our glorious isle,— Beaming, as when amidst her forest-depths The savage roam'd, and chanted to the moon. O England! beautiful, and brave, and free, With Ocean, like a bulwark round thee thrown, Thoughts of Thy destiny the heart awake To fearful wonder; from the wildest state Of darkness, raised and magnified by Heaven! What though a troubled Spirit walk the earth And Fancy hear the distant war-drums roll, Long may thy sceptre proudly awe the waves; Still o'er the world enthroned as Island-Queen While each new year adds glory to thy name, May Time be vanquish'd, ere he conquer Thee. HYMN. [Thy temple, Lord! creation stands] Thy temple, Lord! creation stands, Magnificently vast; And o'er it Thine adorning hands A roof of heaven have cast. And there, all sights and sounds proclaim The glory of Thy power, And preach Thine everlasting name To every conscious hour! But though Thy temple be all space, The heaven of heavens Thy throne, Yet deign with condescending grace This earthly fane to own. O here may vocal incense rise, And songs of Zion sound; And lowly hearts and lifted eyes Thy Presence feel around. Salvation through the Blood of Him Who conquer'd Death and Hell, Assist us, O ye seraphim! In strains like yours to tell. And may thy living Gospel reign Till sin and darkness flee, And ransom'd Earth be pure again As when it came from thee! HYMN. [How sacred is that chosen spot] How sacred is that chosen spot Where praise and prayer arise, And earth and time seem half forgot, While Faith unveils the skies, And visions bright in beauty roll Around the tranced believer's soul! One hour within Thy Temple, Lord, When blending hearts can meet, And banquet on Thy blessed word Before the Mercy-seat, The antepast of heaven may prove, And teach us how Thine angels love. And ever in this calm abode May Thy pure Spirit be, And guide us on the narrow road That terminates in Thee; While dews of Thine absolving grace Descend upon our fallen race. Before the Cross where Jesu bled On Calvary's fated hill, With bended knee, and bowing head, And soul devoutly still, May each adoring sinner find Salvation awe and soothe his mind. And by Thy Blood, and by Thy Tears, By all Thy pangs unknown! Allay, O Lord, our rising fears, And make these hearts Thine own; Till each with loud hosannah sings, Hail! Lord of lords, and King of kings! A DREAM OF WORLDS. (1839.) Those starry Wonders, everlasting Worlds Of light and loveliness, I saw them all, As on the magic wings of mystery borne Methought my unembodied spirit swept Immensity. Vast multitudes there shone Of beauteous Orbs, whose brightness was intense, Beyond the noon in its most sunny reign. Majestic, o'er a measureless extent Of azure, moved those high immortal spheres, Less terrible in beauty, but more shaped To mortal vision; as they onward roll'd, Each sounded as instinct with melody. 'Twas but an eye-glance that such pomp reveal'd; And yet, before it pass'd a heaven-like host Of Forms, and Phantoms which can never die While memory lives. Who hath not charm'd the air To rapturous delusion? Who hath lived And yet not loved? and loved, and hath not shaped His angel? Who a paradise not dream'd, When from within a glorious longing woke For that which earth and earthliness to none Supply? Let Nature answer; she will tell What shapes of beauty throng'd a dream of Worlds. The Midnight!—how we gaze upon its pomp Of orbs, and waft ourselves among their host, As though they were bright Palaces for Souls When clay doth not corrupt them. Who shall prove, That such are not bright Eden's of pure bliss Where myriads reap eternity? On high The Seer of old mysteriously was rapt To blessedness; aloft Elijah soar'd, Rapt in dread thunder through the riven skies 'Mid fiery chariots and emblazon'd clouds! And He, the sanctifying Lord of Life, Through air ascended to His throne eterne ... Ever have awe and glory, love and hope Divine, the gaze of rapture skyward turn'd. And oh! the cold may laugh, the worldly jeer, Mocking whate'er their miserable clay Partakes not of the mind's celestial dream— Yet are there spells of beautifying power And passion, which a stern Reality Can never reach. Go, ask the widow'd heart Of young Affection, when she walks the night As in a vision of departed hours, If all which day-charms yield, her love transforms To such a blissful heaven of memory, As that sweet lonely Star, whose angel-gaze Like Mercy looks upon her lifted eye! Or, ask a friend, of some bright Soul bereaved, When stars expressively the sky adorn, What radiant solace from their beam is caught, While Fancy sighing thinks, “My friend is there!” Ye holy Watchers! who this earth have view'd In darkness rolling on to destiny Through countless ages, and are glorious still, With no feign'd worship sing I your romance. My boyhood was Chaldean; and your beams Like rays of feeling quiver'd round my heart: Yes, I remember, when becalm'd and still My school-companions on their couches slept, With moonlight on their beautiful young brows Like holiness arraying them for heaven,— Unhinder'd, to my casement I would steal, And muse; and gaze upon the midnight-orbs Until my spirit seem'd the skies to float. Such homage for the heavens is not extinct: For now, when weary of the heartless stir Around me, and sad nothings which o'erwhelm The daylight, and our nobler mind disease; When darken'd by unkindness, or deceived By finding clouds where sunshine should prevail: In such dark mood, upon those peaceful worlds That shame us with their bright sublimity, I gaze, and woo unheavenly fancy off By visioning eternity.—Mere time Too great a burden on our spirit lays; We bow before our idols, and adore The glittering falsehood of some fading scene; Forgetful of yon glorious Sky, where, day And night, Divinity is marching forth, In sun or darkness, thunder or in worlds! We know not what these heaven-illuming orbs May be; to us—but Mysteries, that roll And shine. Yet, none upon them ever gazed, Whose eye could gather beauty which the soul Can image, nor within him felt a spell Of admiration, spreading o'er the mind Till it became a mirror of delight Reflecting back the glory that it hail'd. And oft have I some heaven-born influence caught, When sick of human Festival, where smiles Are tutor'd till the heart forget to reign, And eyes are beaming with hypocrisy; While that soft tongue, whose angel-accents fall In honey'd accents on the flatter'd ear Can play the dagger, when the moment comes!— How often, tired with such delightless pomp, I've hail'd the homeward solitary way: Here, once again, the immeasurable sky Around me, and a starry wilderness Open and free, for spirit to expand, With what a worship hath my soul return'd To night and nature, to itself and heaven! A FADING SCENE. A fading scene, a fading scene Is this false world below; And not a heart has ever been Which hath not proved it so. The clouds are dying while we gaze Upon them, young and warm; And sweet flowers in the summer-rays But perish while they charm. The trees that woo'd us as we pass'd With many a leafy strain, Bow, wither'd by autumnal blast, When visited again. The music which the soul doth melt Like magic from the skies, Though sweetly-heard, and softly-felt, In swiftest echo flies. Our pleasures are but fainting hues Reflected o'er the waves; Our glories,—they are phantom-views Which lure us to our graves! And Beauty,—see her 'mid the crowd A night-queen in her bloom! To-morrow, in her maiden shroud A martyr for the tomb! And Love,—how frequent does it mourn For some remember'd scene; Or, doom'd in darkness reft or lorn To live on what hath been. And Friends,—alas, how few we find That consecrate the name, With glowing heart and generous mind, To feed their hallow'd flame: But should there be some blessed one, However sad or lone, Whom dearly we can look upon And feel such friend our own, The iron wings of Fate unfold And bear him far away: Or else, we mourn him dead and cold Companion of the clay. Oh, no! there's nothing on this earth We fashion, or we feel, But death is mingled with its birth And sorrow with its weal. Then, hail the hour of glorious doom! That wafts my soul away To regions radiant with the bloom Of everlasting day. THE DEPARTED YEAR. “In silent night the vision of the dead passed by— I saw our friends all pass,— And oh! in silent night I saw the open graves— I saw th' immortal host!” Klopstock's Odes. A vision, by eternity unveil'd, When midnight in a trance of darkness lay, My soul beheld. Methought that time and earth Had vanish'd, while the unforgotten Dead In glory bright and bodiless appear'd. How deep their gaze! oh, how divine their smile! A pensive mildness, an immortal grace Each Semblance wore; the father had not lost That light paternal which his living eyes To greet his children, loved to have express'd; Still on the mother's placid brow was throned A tenderness, which triumph'd o'er decay; And perish'd babes, whose beauty dazzled time, In the young bloom of resurrection rose Serenely glad, and innocently-bright. And thus, by dreams of never-dying soul, The Dead around us, with a voiceless power Are present, mentally distinct and known; As though some chain, whose links are unbeheld, The living and the dead conjoin'd, that love, E'en in the grave, no gloomy trance might bear, But throb immortal in the spirit's core! Thought flies the banquet, to embrace the tomb: And, oh! if joy-wing'd hours awhile seduce A faithful mourner from his fond regret; If the dull prose of daily life contract And dry his feelings into worldly dust, Or selfish duty,—how divinely-pure The calm of intellectual grief again! Thus can creative fondness from the world Of parted spirits, all it loved evoke: And he whose years are chronicles of wo, From the strange earth, where few companions dwell, Can wander where the hopes of youth repose, And make eternity his mighty home.— A hollow knell heaves mournful on the air, And my dark song in solemn echo rolls To that dread music. From this orb of time Another in the noon of manhood call'd To lie and fester with unfeeling clay!— Oh, God! the terror of Thy rising frown Mantles the universe with more than night: Each Kingdom, like a childless Rachel, mourns; A Power of darkness, on the wings of death, Hath travell'd earth with pestilential speed, And left but havoc to declare his flight. How many tombs this Year hath dug! what homes Are fill'd with desolation's fearful calm! The chairs are vacant where the Forms we loved So oft reposed, where still their semblance chains Our fix'd and fond delusion! In the streets, Like silent mourners in a talking crowd, Cold mansions tenantless and still remain, From whose glad chambers rush'd the household-tones That made sweet music to a social mind; And many a garden, whose luxuriant green And laurell'd bowers the sunbeams loved to grace, In weedy ruin is decaying now: The hands it welcomed with rewarding bloom, Are iced by death, and ne'er can tend it more. 'Twas exquisite for him, whose town-worn life Was fever'd by the hot and fretful day, When evening, like an angel-wing, could waft His spirit home, to greet yon tranquil cot Again, and bid the vexing world depart. How dear the beauty of each dawning flower, How rich the melody of choral leaves, To him, whose wisdom was a feeling mind! And thou, lone sharer of a widow'd lot! Where is the language, though a Seraph hymn'd The poetry of heaven, to picture thee, Doom'd to remain on Desolation's rock And look for ever where the Past lies dead! What is the world to thy benighted soul? A dungeon! save that there thy children's tones Can ring with gladness its sepulchral gloom. Placid, and cold, and spiritually-pale, Art thou; the lustre of thy youth is dimm'd, The verdure of thy spirit o'er: in vain The beaming eloquence of day attracts Thy heart's communion with Creation's joy; Like twilight imaged on a bank of snow The smile that waneth o'er thy marble cheek! Oh, when shall trial, tears, and torture cease? Despair, and frenzy, and remorseless gloom, Defiance, and the Thoughts which crouch before The bright severity of Virtue's eye, When shall their mystery lie unweaved, and bare? When shall the lips of Agony be dumb, And the dark wail of wounded Nature hush'd? A Tragedy of twice three thousand years Hath almost ended; soon perchance, may fall A Curtain, whose unfolding darkness brings Oblivion o'er the universe decay'd. Already looks Earth's final scene begun: The elements, like human limbs unnerved, Forego their function; seasons out of tune Creation's harmony of change destroy; And in their wildness of unwonted act Reflective eyes an awful omen read, By Nature given to prophetic man Of Time's conclusion. Sea and Air confess A strange excitement; through the trackless heaven's Immensity the unheard Comet rolls; No vision'd eye his path may comprehend, Nor dread imagination dream, what orbs May crumble, or what blighted planets shrink As on the burning Desolator sweeps And blazes o'er annihilated worlds! Spoiler of hearts and empires! vanish'd Year, Ere for eternity thy wings were spread Alone I listen'd to thy dark farewell.— The moon was center'd in the cloudless heaven Pallid as beauty on the brow of death; And round about her, with attracted beams, Group'd the mild stars; the anarchy of day Was hush'd, the turbulence of life becalm'd. From where I stood, a vast and voiceless plain, A City garmented with mellow light Lay visible; and, like romance in stone, Shone gloriously serene. All sounds were dead: The dew-drop, stirless as a frozen tear Gleam'd on the verdure; not an air-tone rang; The leaves hung trancéd as the lids of Sleep; Around me Nature in devotion seem'd, The Elements in adoration knelt, Till all grew worship,—from the heart of Things Material, to the conscious soul of man! 'Twas then, sepulchral, hollow, deep, and loud, The bell of Midnight on the stillness burst And made the air one atmosphere of awe. Sublime of hours! I thought on all the grave Had buried, since the infant Year began: What dreams, what agonies untold Dead as the hearts whose depth they once turmoil'd, Lay motionless, and mute! Of pomp in dust, Of wither'd pride, of wealth from glory hurl'd, Of lull'd ambition and appeased despair,— Of each I dreamt: and then, in sad array, Pale visions of the Kings of thought arose, The wise, the wondrous, the adored, whose deaths Enrich'd eternity with added mind, Sleep with the Patriarchs now! and one how great! For whom the costly tears of genius fell;— The wand is broken, and the Wizard gone! Many and mighty are the stars of Fame; But his deep splendour has outdazzled all Since Shakspeare, that unrivall'd planet! rose, Whose radiance clad the intellectual heaven. Yes, he hath vanish'd; but his country wears A veil of glory that shall garb her clime For ever. How we hung upon his parting hour! And when it summon'd the transcendant Mind From earth to heaven, the souls of myriads felt O'ershadow'd; Europe bow'd in dim eclipse, And Kingdoms mourn'd round his imagined tomb. Monarchs of time, and ministers of thought, Felt in the frame of intellectual life As rolls the blood-tide through our breathing form, Where is the palace of your spirits now? In what immensity are ye enshrined, Imperishably pure? Was quiet earth In beauty, but an archetype of heaven? Your dreams, your towering aspirations high, The far-off shadows of each Truth divine,— Are all absorb'd in beatific light, And this world like a rain-drop in the deep Of time, for ever from the soul dissolved? Our craving passion for the Unreveal'd Fain would it know, to what vast height removed, To what perfection of sublimest powers Ye are ascended: but, the baffled Wish Is driven earthward, and cold Nature cries In tones as thrilling as the touch of Death, “Back to thy clay, Mortality! and bend Like Faith, before the infinite Unknown.” As water copies a portentous cloud By stern reflection, so the spirit's gloom Lies darkly-mirror'd on the mimic page. And if some features of a faded Past Be thus recall'd, they bring no aimless grief To deaden song, by female worth inspired. For seldom, since the groan of earth began, Hath Woman shone more visibly-divine Than in the gloom of this remember'd year! When Forms all spirit, moulded by the touch Of Nature in her most ethereal power, Whose beauty, delicate as painted air At the light breeze seem'd ready to dissolve, Transform'd by feeling, have at once become Heroical, for superhuman aid! Behold that chamber, where a feeble lamp Is quivering, pulse-like, with a dying flame; There, by yon couch, a soft-eyed mourner fades Night after night, with uncomplaining brow: While a soul flutters in that Form revered From whence her being,—though her brain should parch Till the flush'd eyelids hang like drooping flowers About to wither, still, her watch endures! The bough may blossom from the tree removed, Ere young affection, from its parent torn, Can live and flourish, while one ebbing pulse Articulates within those precious veins! And thus, calamity with glory comes: From out its gloom, as streams from caverns pour, The tides of human tenderness proceed. And virtues, which the noon-bright hour of joy May dazzle, when a cloud of anguish breaks, Dawn into birth, and decorate the soul With heaven-born lustre; like the pale-eyed stars That shut their lids when gaudy daylight rules, But ope them on the sun-forsaken night. Then let the scorner, whom the vernal glee Or laughing wildness of delighted youth Hath taught, that pleasure would to pain deny The sacrifice of one exalted tear, His creed forego: the fount of Woman's heart Lies deeper than his shallow gaze detects! For Beauty, that a soulless idol seem'd Rear'd on the breath of some adoring night, Oh, let one pang a cherish'd mind convulse, The mist is scatter'd! and the unblemish'd heart Free from the world, like day from darkness comes, And acts at once the ministry of heaven. Then look at Woman, when by love sublimed: Misfortune moulds her by a graceful power To fit the cast of fate; and in her wo Each mental attribute can bloom as bright As when the home was costly, and her smile Fell like a glory on attracted eyes. As stoops an eagle from his lordly height Where once he soar'd, companion of the cloud And storm, so sinks, with a triumphant fall, Her spirit down to some domestic vale; There, looks more beauteous in each act and thought Through the meek round her cottage-virtues run, Than when it reign'd amid the hall of kings. A mortal Weakness by the world admired Let others paint her; and, in Woman find The uncertain heart by light-wing'd impulse led, The mind which fruitless admiration feeds, The tottering purpose, and the tameless will: There is a passion, that with fine eclipse O'ershadows all such failing hours present, When the soul falters,—'tis maternal love! Unbounded feeling! Space, and Scene and Time Succumb before thee: infinite in power As fathomless in depth; no rack affrights, No dungeon quells, no agony impedes Thy wondrous action; in the horrid grave Thou darest to cherish the unconscious Dead, And heaven admits Thee, when thou soarest there! Lo, how that feeling with transforming might Shapes a wild spirit to its tender will! Gay as the breeze and dainty as the flower To-night behold her, on whose jewell'd head Fashion hath set an ever-fading crown: Again regard her!—and the trace of God Is character'd on that ethereal change Mien, mind, and manner all have undergone; As broods a Poet o'er some wordless thought Affection gazes on her unborn child; And, ere its being into life expands Love, like a seraph when the soul departs For glory, waiting to receive its charge, Stands on the threshold of commencing Life Bright with the welcome of a mother's bliss! Charm of the world! whose light makes human love, If I apparel with too rich a robe The fascinations which around thee float, And on thy beauty let no dimness fall To mar its radiance, 'tis an error blest, Though blind: for Thou, in thy transcendent worth, Art lifted to the highest sphere of Song, When, like a human providence below, Thy days are consecrate to deeds of heaven. Lincoln College, Oxon, 1833. REFLECTIVE STANZAS. There is a sadness in my soul, But whence, and why, I cannot tell; As though a Spirit's dark control Had bound it with a deadening spell. The sun wears not that glorious brow Poetic morns were wont to bring; And many a wind which mourneth now, A song of rapture used to sing. For all my summer-glow of thought Hath sadden'd into wintry gloom; And much that Fancy shaped or sought Lies buried in oblivion's tomb. Yet, dream not that I nurse the grief Which discontented moments bring; Or sullen gloom, whose sole relief Comes flowing from a bitter spring. For human hearts, where'er they breathe, Have still their human charm for me: I would not bind a selfish wreath Without one bud of sympathy! Then let me not a mournfulness From clouds of hidden sorrow steal; Nor wring from thee a vain distress A bosom soft as thine would feel. A scene of sunshine and of gloom, Like human life my page will be; And, mutter'd o'er our mortal doom, Will sound a dark Soliloquy! Thou wilt not deem such verse supplied By superstition's haggard gaze; Nor think that Fancy's wing hath tried To wander in forbidden ways. Who paints His beauty on the cloud, Or smileth on the breezy shore, Or wraps Him in a whirlwind-shroud Or speaketh in the thunder-roar, That Power, the visionless and dread, In words where inspirations dwell, By His almightiness hath said, Earth wears a shadow cast from Hell! The Spirits and the Powers of air In mystery and in might they roam; Unseen they act, unknown they dare, And make the evil heart their home. And One, their centre and their soul There is; the demon-god of sin Who o'er the wicked hath control And fires the hell we feel within. And such a Wanderer o'er the earth The viewless Power I've dared to draw; And mentally have given birth To all he felt, and all he saw: To each avenging throe of thought That might so dread a Spirit thrill, With hateful ruin ever fraught,— Yet blasted and believing still! Thus Virtues are as Heaven reveal'd, And Love and Truth eternal shown; While whatsoe'er the Tempter wield, Is darkly hued, and stamp'd his own. Nor marvel thou, if scenery bright And beautiful by Nature made, If sight and sound that yield delight, Are in elysian charm array'd: For who can bliss or beauty know Like him, a Rebel from the skies, Who, though his doom be endless wo, Hath witness'd all pure Angels prize? And such the matter of my verse Whate'er its fate or force may be,— Inwoven with the primal curse, But, hailing immortality. An awful maze for human Mind! And enter'd with a holy fear; God of my sires! where I am blind, Descend, and make Thy glory clear. How darkly-bound this scene of life, How dread the mysteries of time, And all our being's passion-strife With things unholy and sublime, I ever felt:—and deeply now, As o'er the page my fancies steal, My spirit seems in awe to bow Beneath a Sense the bravest feel. The wings of Darkness are unfurl'd, The Earth lies hush'd, as in her grave; And all the sound that thrills the world The rocking of yon midnight-wave! Who hath not own'd such tragic hour, The sadness, and the dream it brings, Solemnity and spirit-power Reflected from Eternal Things? O'er time and destiny we weave Our inward-fancies, thick and fast; And start to see, how moments leave The present, to begin the past! And we, my friend, howe'er our doom Of life and years may varied be, Must pierce the dampness of the tomb And mingle with eternity. And what art Thou?—The dark Unknown Thy name to mortals bound and blind; Yet like a faint-heard mystic tone Thy meaning hovers o'er my mind. I see Thee in the vigil-star, I hear Thee in the muttering Deep; And, like a feeling from afar, Thy Shadow riseth o'er my sleep: Thou comest where the witching power Of festive hearts alone should be, Till life itself appears an hour That flutters o'er eternity! Away with this! and may I feel Whatever cloud o'erhang my lot There is a joy Time cannot steal, There blooms a flower which fadeth not. And might I doom my future days, Like thee, I'd seek some calm retreat Unhaunted by the public gaze, And only to the pensive sweet. For nobler far thy noiseless life Than all the gayer World can give; Whose best reward's a wretched strife 'Tween fear to die, and hate to live! I see thee oft, my guardian friend, Companion of the mead and bower,— What glories from the hills descend, What meekness flows from every flower! To thee, the hymn of winds and brooks, The waving joy of wood and field, With all fresh Nature's thousand looks, A love and holy feeling yield. And long be thine the unruffled hour That leaves thee guiltless as thou art; And never may one evil power Profane the heaven within thy heart. Thus, blooming shall thy pleasures last, And leave thee grateful, calm, and sage; While Memory, smiling o'er the past, Shall be the vesper-star of age. And when mysterious time is o'er And round my soul are scenes divine, Oh, may it reach th' Eternal Shore As placid and as pure as thine! BEAUTY. (1827.) Oh, Beauty is the master charm, The syren of the soul, Whose magic zone encompasseth Creation with control; The love and light of human Kind, And foster-flame of ev'ry mind. 'Twas Beauty hung the blue-robed heavens, She glitters in each star; Or trippeth on the twilight-breeze In melody afar; She danceth on the dimpled stream, And gambols in the ripple's gleam, She couches on the coral wave, And garlandeth the sea; Or weaves a music in the wind Which murmurs from the lea; She paints the clouds, and points the ray, And basketh in the blush of day. She sits among the blossom'd trees And streaks the bud and flower; Becharms the air, and drops the dew Upon the moonlit-bower: 'Tis she unwreaths the locks of Night, And freshens nature with delight. And Woman!—Beauty was the power That with angelic grace Breathed love around her glowing form, And magic in her face; She twined the tendrils of her hair, And on that brow—Her throne is there! Oh! Beauty is the master-charm, The syren of the soul, Whose magic zone encompasseth Creation with control: The love and light of human Kind, And foster-flame of ev'ry mind. A DAUGHTER'S APOSTROPHE TO A DEPARTED MOTHER. (1827.) If gentle spirits wing'd away To some elysian sphere, Can hear Affection meekly pray, Or mark a mourner's tear; Pure Spirit! shrined in realms of love Beyond this earthly wild, Oh! breathe calm influence from above To bless thine orphan-child. As oft at pensive eve I roam Thine image visits me; While Fancy paints the radiant home Once so adorn'd by thee! The smile which rambled o'er thy cheek And shamed the pang of art; The mellow tones I heard thee speak, Still linger round my heart. That glowing welcome of thine eye, The fondness in thy fear; The meek borne anguish in thy sigh, The pity in thy tear; The mild reluctance in each frown That won me ere it changed; The glance which charm'd my spirit down, When giddily it ranged; Those lips that lull'd each maiden wo And bade the smile to play, Nor left the scalding tears to flow But kiss'd them all away, Yes! these, and all the spells of love That charm'd my childhood's hour, Oft bear me to yon home above To thy seraphic bower. Oh, if thou hear my orphan-prayer And yearning fondness see, Thou know'st I sigh to enter there And be at rest with thee! STANZAS. [Oh! rest thee in thy green-turf grave] (1825.) Oh! rest thee in thy green-turf grave, There is no sorrow there; For tomb'd within, the wretched have A freedom from despair. No more shall come the hour of wo, Nor hope's delusive light; Untroubled is thy sleep below, Upon the bed of night. The dews of anguish damp'd thy brow, Thine was the wither'd heart; No stormy woes can scare thee now, So dreamless as thou art! Then rest thee in thine early tomb Beneath the dewy sod, Till Mercy shall unshroud the gloom And summon thee to God. THE CRUCIFIXION. (1827.) Rock of the Church, and Rest of wearied souls! Thou that wert bosom'd in the searchless depths Of uncreated Light, before the world Roll'd fresh and glittering from almighty Hands, The hymning Choristers, who harp on high, Alone the sorrows of Thy love can sing; Of love, that snatch'd a universe from hell And oped for man the starry gates of heaven! Lo! in yon pillar'd hall, amid the hum Of fierce-tongued soldiers, God incarnate stands All quivering from the scourge! around they rave, And tear His lowly dress with tiger-hands, Then robe Him in an azure vest, and crown His godlike temples with entwinèd thorns: At last, as from His pierced and flesh-torn brow The heavy blood-drops ooze, with impious jeer Within His hand the sceptre-reed they place, And kneel, and bow, and smite His awful head, And spit upon His grief-worn face, and cry, “Hail, Monarch of the Jews!” That mockery's o'er; And now, to crucifixion see Him led His cross in front by some Cyrenian borne. Oh, never yet was such an Altar rear'd! Oh, never yet was such an Offering slain! His agony is dumb; they scoff, and taunt, And grind their murderous teeth, but not a throe Of ire can ripple His Almighty calm! Forgiveness is His prayer: The undying souls Of those long swallow'd in the eternal gulph, And they who are, and they that shall be born To battle with the Flesh; the Throne of God, And all the bright-wing'd Choirs, whose harps shall ring “Salvation!” through the star-roof'd halls of heaven To welcome back the Heir of Glory,—these Are imaged round His heart: and deadly pangs Force no resentful frown. At Golgotha The blessed Christ behold! Upon the Cross, Upon the cross His holy limbs are stretch'd; And every nerve and vein is rack'd, and wrench'd, By agonies unspeakable; and look! How through His palms the hammer'd nails have pierced, And through His bare and unresisting feet The red wounds gape, and bleed! Stupendous hour Of awful pain,—the martyr'd Son of God On yon dread Tree uprear'd, the World to save! Approach! and gaze; and wonder till ye weep! Convulsive lines of torture grave His face, And flutter o'er His breast; the veins unroll In loose and languid stretch, and from His brow The lukewarm life-stream trickles slowly down, And clots beneath His feet. His head is bent Blood-matted o'er His shoulder: while His eyes Dim-grown, and hollow with the rack, look meek Upon His butchers round the Cross, who scoff, And o'er His riven garment cast their lots. And, lo, with eye upturn'd in voiceless wo, His Virgin-mother! all a mother's pangs Of pity for her tortured Son upheave Her bosom, and array her bloodless cheek; Nor can the deadly riot of His pains Chill the warm current of celestial love: Adown, with tender gaze of truth, He looks, And to the bosom-partner of his toils Confides the weeping Mary, to a Son! And sad, but ignominious Sight! two thieves In bloody fellowship with Christ are hung: One turns around, with sidelong-glance of scorn, To rail, and mutters from his parchèd throat A hideous jeer: the other, meek and faint, Dejected cries, “Remember me, O Christ! When Thou art in the palace of Thy love!” Divine, and glorious answer! “Ere the Day Shall die, in Paradise with Me thou'lt walk.” But, see, in clouds the Sun hath sunk away As if aghast! A pall of darkness shrouds The land of Palestine; a speechless gloom More ghastly than Tartarean night. The hills Grow dim; the Rivers moan as if in dread; And men, with quailing limbs and ashy lips Come forth, and stare, tongue-tied, upon the skies! And hark: from off the Cross, is loudly heard, In piercing tones of death, “My God! My God! Oh, why hast Thou forsaken me?”—Again! “My God! My God! oh, why dost Thou forsake?” 'Tis o'er! the blood-red Eye is film'd, and shut Within its socket; 'gainst His weary breast The last heart-pulse hath beat; and now, behold In death's pale slumber, while His tender lips Have sweet compassion printed on their curve, The Christ! a Sacrifice for lost mankind. Oh, never since the infant beam of Time Glanced on the new-born world, was such an hour! To symbol it, the Temple's veil was rent; The Sun of Israel set; the God-breathed curse With holy Blood was blotted out; Earth quail'd As though some impulse out of Hell had come To heave her huge foundations! Every rock And mountain throbb'd, while o'er the muttering Deep The dismal waters coil'd, as if they fear'd! And last, the graves themselves unlock'd, and Shades Stalk'd out, and glided through the quaking Town, And floated by the living, like faint gleams Of pallid moonlight o'er some haunted Shrine. Hell heard; and shudder'd as it heard the wail And dying words of Christ; while Satan howl'd And gnash'd his teeth, amid the furnace-glow Of everlasting Fires, to know his wrath Should ne'er be glutted on the World; that Heaven Was won, and to rebellious Man unbarr'd. Unbarr'd!—oh, if Imagination may Plume her young wings, and wander faith-born, there, A peal more joyous than the choral Stars, Upon the birth-day of created Worlds, Re-echoed round her crystal domes; while all The countless Seraphs wreathed their lustrous wings In awe, before the lightning-shrouded Throne Of God invisible; then, woke their harps To melodies divine, and hail'd The Lamb Triumphant from His martyrdom below! Two thousand Years have almost floated down The gulph of time, since on the glorious Cross Divinest Martyr! Thou wert nail'd: the world With all its pageantry and pride prevails; Men smile and struggle, labour, sin, and die As if Thy Blood had never blotted out The crimes of earth; as if, at last, Thy might And majesty should not appear! Still, Thou Hast prophesied, again the Incarnate God This earth will visit and her dead restore.— But, not as homeless orphan of the world, To wander on in pain and wo, and weep, And perish on the Tree; but on Thy car Of lightning, rolling from unfathom'd depths Of heaven, while seraphs robed in radiant light, Brandish their glitt'ring banners o'er Thy throne, And all the clouds like burning billows flash And bound beneath Thy feet!—The Trump shall peal That dead-awakening blast, more full and loud Than thunder in its deepest roar: the Sea Shall yawn, and all her buried hosts arise; The graves burst open, and the dust unite Into a living Form; and then, shall come The Judgment, and our Everlasting Doom! STANZAS WRITTEN IN DEJECTION. I. The pining leaf, the perish'd flower, The tints of autumn thrown In pensive ruin o'er some bower Where gay spring-buds had grown; The faltering wave, the feeble cloud Which faints like thought away, With Nature's warning unavow'd Predict our own decay. And who can look down Life's dim vale Where buried hours repose, Or listen to the rueful tale Of man's recurring woes, Nor feel within the spirit-core A pang of mute regret, For feelings that exist no more, For joys whose sun is set! Yes, Lady! in this life of dreams My heart has had its share; And still around wild fancy beams The wreck of visions fair; But hollow laugh, and heartless smile, And tones of mirth untrue, Can barely mock the soul awhile And veil it from thy view. Another to the countless mass Of Spirits who have fled, I add my sigh, as on I pass To regions of the dead! II. Yon sunbeams in their brightest mirth Are dancing o'er the sea, And hues and harmonies of earth Betoken summer's glee. I watch the clouds with fairy glide Athwart the blue air gleam, And view them mirror'd on the tide Like features in a dream: The very leaves are toned with joy And carol to the wind, Gaily as when, a pangless boy, They echo'd back my mind: Gladness and glory blend their sway Around this ocean scene; And yet, to me the brightest day Is dark, to what hath been! The flowers of hope, the young and fair, Are dewless, cold, or dead; The lip may laugh, but where, oh, where The inward sunshine fled? I hear the voice of vanish'd Hours, And mourn the buried Past; Oh, why should feeling e'er be ours, And nought but memory last! Oystermouth, July, 1833. THE DREADFUL PRAYER. (1827.) No priestly vows avail'd: gaunt Famine stalk'd Through Cairo's streets by day and night, and suck'd The life-blood from her hungry thousands there. From wall to wall, from house to house, were heard The gasping yells of famish'd men, and wail Of mothers, with dead infants at their breasts, Whose bakèd lips, and eyelids curling up Like wither'd violet-leaves, and fleshless hands, Were blasted by the pest of Famine's touch! In agony some gnaw'd their nails; some groan'd And with a horrid glare their eyeballs work'd, Rooted their tresses,—and expired! And here Pale groups, with bony cheek and beamless stare, Stagger'd abroad, and choked themselves with cries For death; while others, 'neath funereal-palls Moved slowly on, like sable thunder-clouds; Then sat, and howl'd upon the new-dug graves! So ghastly look'd the bloodless Shapes around, That Cairo seem'd a charnel-house revived Whose dregs were crawling into life again! In vain the Priests with agonising prayer Storm'd the mute Heavens; no Mercy smiled An answer to their vows. Still, Famine swept Her thousands into dust; still, every wind Wing'd to the skies the howlings of Despair! At length, unspotted babes, whose milk-white robes Gleam'd pure as dove-wings on the radiant air, By Imans led, the Minaret-spires up climb'd For pestilence to pray, the Famine's cure! There, on the gilded peaks their hands were raised In adoration clasp'd, as if with prayer instinct; And while their cherub-mouths in lisping tones The plague besought, a pale-eyed Crowd below Stirr'd like a moaning Wind upon the deep; Their lean lips moved, and mutter'd, “Let it be!” That prayer Heaven heard: a Pestilence came down, And made an atmosphere for death! Men dropp'd Into corruption, thick as winter blights Upon the poison'd bushes. Hill and dale, Hamlet and city, groan'd with ghastly piles Of green-eyed dead: the houses turn'd to tombs; And they who roam'd the Desert's dewless wilds Were plague-smit by the way, and moulder'd there Like riven branches from a forest-tree: And thus was Cairo cursed, till by the dead The Plague, itself corrupted, died away! INFANCY. “The smile of childhood on the cheek of age.” A child beside a mother kneels With lips of holy love; And fain would lisp the vow it feels, To Him enthroned above. That cherub gaze, that stainless brow So exquisitely fair! Who would not be an infant now, To breathe an infant-prayer? No crime hath shaded its young heart, The eye scarce knows a tear; 'Tis bright enough from earth to part And grace another sphere! And I was once a happy Thing Like that which now I see; No May-bird on ecstatic wing More beautifully-free: The cloud which bask'd in noontide-glow, The flower that danced and shone, All hues and sounds, above, below Were joys to feast upon! Let Wisdom smile, I oft forget The colder haunts of men, To hie where infant hearts are met, And be a child again: To look into their laughing eyes And see the wild thoughts play, While o'er each cheek a thousand dyes Of mirth and meaning stray: O Manhood! could thy spirit kneel Beside that sunny child, As fondly pray, and purely feel With soul as undefiled, That moment would encircle thee With light and love divine; Thy gaze might dwell on Deity And heaven itself be thine! BEAUTIFUL INFLUENCES. “Suppose the singing birds musicians; The flowers fair ladies; and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure, or a dance.” Shakspeare. (1829.) Oh for a summer-noon, when light and breeze Sport on the grass like ripples o'er a lake Alive with freshness; when the regal Sun, With God's own smile upon his forehead seen, Walks in his golden radiance through the path Cerulean.—Vast and overhanging heaven! Arching the earth with thy majestic sweep, At such an hour, with what unsated eye We look upon thee, till the mind seems lost In thine immensity, and we appear O'erwhelm'd by such a vision. Care-worn man! Whom Duty chains within the city-walls Amid the toiling crowd, how grateful plays The fresh wind o'er thy sickly brow, when free To tread the elastic turf; and hear the trees Wave music on the gales; to catch the voice Of waters, gushing from their fount unseen, And singing as they wander:—How sublime Upon a time-blanch'd cliff to muse, and while The eagle glories in a sea of air, To mingle with the scene around! survey The sun-warm heaven, or at the cavern'd base Of yon wood-crested mount, the ocean view With radiant billows ruffled by the breeze: Then, dawns the resurrection of thy youth In dewy freshness o'er thy wither'd heart! Nor is the scene, though unbeheld, forgot; The eye is faithful to a feeling heart: When torn from some Arcadian haunt, we thread The crowded city's unromantic streets, The spot we love refreshing influence yields; Beneath our feet a fairy pathway flows; The grass still flutters in the summer-winds, The dusky wood and distant copse appear, And that lone stream, upon whose chequer'd face We mused, when noon-rays made the pebbles gleam With gem-like dazzle through the wrinkled tide, Is mirror'd to the mind: though all around Be rattling hoofs and roaring wheels, the eye Seems wandering where the heart delights to dwell. Are there not hours of an immortal birth, Bright visitations from a purer Sphere,— A trance of glory, when the Mind to heaven Attuned, can out of dreams her worlds create? Oh! none are so absorb'd, as not to feel Those calming thoughts which harmonise the mind. When prayer, the purest incense of a soul, Hath risen to the Throne of heaven, the heart Is mellow'd; and the shadows which becloud Our state of darken'd being, glide away; The heavens are open'd; and the eye of Faith Looks in, and hath a mystic glance of God! And, Genius, undisputed gift of heaven, From Thee what feelings flow! the passions own Thy sway, and waken at thy quickening power Like flowers expanding to the breath of morn. Then bind his temples with a fadeless wreath; Give him the proudest seat, a princely rank And all the deeper homage of the mind, Who like a god among mankind is felt, And, from the purest sunshine of his soul Sends forth the rays which glorify the world! Who hath not felt the might of genius rise, And stir his spirit to a storm of thought? Oh! had I kingdoms, I would yield them all To him, whose thoughts like angel-wings exalt The fancy, and a thousand springs unlock Of feeling, that have never gush'd before. So noble is such joy, that I have blush'd For all dark thoughts, for all demeaning cares. In such rapt mood our solitude is fill'd With bright creations; and clysian scenes Ope in a vision on the eye of Thought. Thus charm'd by Genius, hie thee to the haunts Where Nature shows her blooming face! how bright The sun, how beautiful the liquid air,— Like floating music! and the soft-toned wind Around thee warbling like a conscious joy. A veil of beauty o'er the world is drawn, Till thy heart seems to beat for all mankind, And, full of glorious feeling, thou wouldst fain Become an Angel to adore thy God,— A more than mortal to complete His praise. And will not Mind a beauteous influence yield? Oh, glorious 'tis, amid some room antique To study, all alone, those pictured Shapes From the soul's Eden call'd! where genius sheds Spells of entrancement round you; and while the eye Banquets on beauty, from a painter's soul. Whether a landscape, whose ethereal lights Like gleams upon the water, glow o'er tree And bower, and sky luxuriantly bespread, Or love-shaped forms, or features angel-bright Float o'er the enamour'd gaze,—a rich Excess, a harmony of feeling rules The fancy, when again the world we greet; The mind with loveliness is bathed, which yearns Enchantment over common scenes to throw, And make dull earth draw nearer heaven, at last! Who hath not felt the spirit of a Voice, Its echo haunt him in romantic hours? From Melody's own lip who hath not heard Sounds which become a music to his mind? Music is heaven-born! In the festal home When throbs a lyre, as if instinct with life, And some sweet mouth is full of song, how soon From eye to eye a rapture flows, from heart To heart! while, floating from the past, the Forms We love, are re-created; and the smile Which lights the cheek is mirror'd on the heart. So beautiful the potency of sound, There is a magic in the homely chime Of village-bells; I love to hear them roll Upon the breeze; like voices from the Dead They seem to hail us from a viewless World! And yet, nor music, nor the painter's mind Upon the canvas breathed, a charm imprints So deeply-faithful, as the piercing glance Of young-eyed Beauty. Beauty!—she hath been The witching tyrant of the universe Since her young blush in Paradise began; Her throne Time cannot shake; stern Wisdom bows Before her; warriors are her slaves; and half The vassal world hath worshipp'd at her feet! Her glance is conquest; and the Mind is moved Like air by music haunted, when her name Melts on the ear, and makes the heart serene. Then, cursed be he that with unhallow'd eye Can look on Beauty; which for heaven is born, The boast of nature, and the spell of souls! LOST FEELINGS. “But yet we stand In a lone land, Like tombs to mark the memory Of hopes and joys which fade and flee In the light of life's dim morning.” Oh! weep not, if our beauty wears Beneath the wings of time; That age conceals the brow with cares That once appear'd sublime. Oh! weep not if the clouded eye No sunny thought can speak; And fresh and fair no longer lie Joy-tints upon the cheek; And weep not, if the ruin-trace Of wasting years is seen Around the form, and in the face Where youthful lines have been: But mourn the inward wreck we feel As blighted hours depart, And Time's corroding fingers steal Young feelings from the heart! Those bounding thoughts which rise and spring From out the buoyant mind, Like summer-bees upon the wing Or echoes on the wind; The hopes that sparkle every hour, Like blossoms from a soul Where sorrow sheds no blighting power, And care has no control, With all the rich enchantment thrown On Life's fair scene around, As if the world within a zone Of happiness were bound,— Oh, these endure a mournful doom As day by day we die; Till age becomes a barren tomb Where perish'd Feelings lie! March, 1828. THE TRANCE. A FRAGMENT. (1827.) ?One faint and lingering glance I took, And then, all vanish'd in the sickly light That swam around the bed; all seem'd to melt, Shaded by indistinctness, like the shore From those who wander far on ocean-waves: A dazzling giddiness my brain dissolved; The eye-balls sunk; and coldly press'd like lead, While creeping chills my pallid form bedew'd, That shrank as if it shudder'd at itself, Or would condense, like water ere it freeze! My life-fount curdled into clotted blood; Then, cold and nerveless lay each marble limb, And moisten'd with the mystic dews of death. Sightless, and breathless, thus entranced I lay; Though motionless, with feeling so acute As if it doubled, to make up for sight: Thus, like a solitary cloud, I seem'd Self-balanced in a universe of gloom! And, oh! how sad it was, to hear and feel Fond friends around me, dreaming Death had closed All sense of life; their blood-warm lips to feel Upon mine ice-cold face, and then to hear Their heart-swell'd groans, and choking sobs and sighs While gazing on my hush'd and breathless form! When midnight-bells had toll'd the World to sleep, A young, but unforgetting sister, came To meditate, and sorrow o'er my doom: Her printless steps I knew, as on they stole Like twilight o'er the flowers. And, when she took My pulseless fingers in her pale-worn hand, And kiss'd the marble brow, and talk'd so sweet, And lisp'd her mournful love,—how horrible That Language could not speak my conscious mind! Two days departed; then, the wonted shroud Enwrapp'd me, and around my body clung Like ruffling waters: last, the coffin came, And well I knew, as with a fear-like touch Of trembling hands, my dead-cold form they lay In funeral vest enveloped. But more drear Than all, was that long, sad, and silent hour When, one by one, the speechless mourners took Their last and lingering glance; their sighs I felt, And tears which burn'd my cheek,—but yet, was still! And, oh, most horrible!—The nails I heard Pierce the crush'd wood and seal my coffin-lid; And then, the rattling hearse, the grave-side prayers, The thick and careless clods, which patter'd down Upon my bier, till bedded with the dust; And then ? TO ? ? ? ? Oh, Lady! in my boyish hour Perchance thou seest me gay as young, The dazzled slave of pleasure's power, With rapture in the heart and tongue. Yet, think not thus I ever seem, As though beyond the world's alloy; For darkness girds our brightest dream, And sorrow tones our deepest joy! I never knew a moment yet Which did not wear some withering stain,— An outline of a dim regret, Or shadow of some coming Pain! Alone amid the world I move, With scarce a smile, or tear, for me, And not a heart to share the love That springs from bosom-sympathy: Without it, what can realms bestow Of all harmonious natures feel? It is to kindred mind we owe The magic Time delights to seal. But, may no winter-shade intrude Upon the spring-time of thy lot, And all which mars my gayest mood In thy young freshness be forgot: May heaven attend thee, wheresoe'er The bright-wing'd years may waft thee on; And nothing cloud that blissful air All eyes have loved to look upon! September 4th, 1829. LONELINESS. “We are not happy, sweet; our state Is strange, and full of doubt and fear; Hiding from many a careless eye The scorned load of agony.” Lost in the peopled desert of the world, Cheer'd by no heart which echoes back our own, How feverish all the pomp and play of Life! A solitude there is which lifts the mind To lofty things,—seclusion from the rush And stir of that unfeeling Crowd, whose days Reap scarce a thought to sanctify their flight. Far from the city-din, may Wisdom haunt Her veil'd retreats, and yet not live alone; For, is there not the fellowship of books Divine, a company of gracious thoughts, And all which Nature yields a grateful mind? Such is not loneliness!—Around to look Life's crowded world, and 'mong its myriad-hearts No sympathies to find, our own to nurse, Oh, this makes loneliness! that solitude Of mind, which bids the world a desert seem. What is the guerdon of ambition worth, Of common lips the cold applause, the crown Of genius, or the envied wreath of Fame, Graced by no smile from some congenial soul? For, when the heart is full, an overflow Of bliss, by being shared, is sweeter still: The bashful flowers which in the May-breeze shake, Bloom out together: and belated Stars Of night walk not yon pathless heavens alone, But twinkle, though unseen, in blissful play Of sympathetic beams; all beauteous Things Hold mystic fellowship; and fine-toned hearts Without responding hearts,—how bleak and bare! In sorrow lone, in happiness the same. A man I knew, in mind and fame supreme And yet, not happy, though by happiest ones Admired. A loftiness of feeling sprung From centuries dead and ancestors unknown, Together with a soul-born pride, which soar'd Far o'er the varied scene of vulgar life, In childhood fill'd him with a thirst of fame. High fancies, from the hills and mountains caught; And inspiration born of lovely streams, And silence-loving woods; and all the rays' Of beauty which creative mind attracts From scenes by Contemplation sought,—awoke His genius into glorious play; the lyre He struck; a World admired, and wreathed his brow With the green laurels of a lofty fame; For him a thousand tongues grew eloquent! A thousand eyes would sparkle forth his praise; And, when amid the brilliant throng he sat A gay-tongued hypocrite, the hour to charm, And not obstruct the flow of joy, the dreams Of young Ambition brighten'd at his praise; Alas, how often his unecho'd mind Clothed its mute anguish with concealing smiles! That soul within a secret blank remain'd Which admiration could not fill. Alone; No trusting heart, no gentle voice of love, No happy faces round his evening-hearth Were his to love; and what was brief renown? A shade! and he?—a soul in solitude. Epsom, October, 18th, 1828. STANZAS. [The hour is past, the pleasure o'er] “The flower that smiles to-day, To-morrow dies; All that we wish to stay, Tempts and then flies: What is this world's delight?” The hour is past, the pleasure o'er, And dumb the heart of glee; Young feet no longer trip the floor Alive with melody. Those fairy brows, those forms of love That wake the dreamer's sigh, Like Shapes who leave their bowers above To charm a human eye: All, all are gone! the lights have fled From yon deserted room; Dim as a chamber of the dead And voiceless as the tomb: And now I am alone again, With feelings undefined; A pilgrim in a world of pain, An unpartaken Mind. The silent walk, the sickly moon, And melancholy sky Unite to make me feel how soon These hours of beauty fly. Oh, pleasure! brief as bright thou art, A momentary ray, A dream roll'd o'er a vacant heart To charm, and melt away! June, 1828. STANZAS. [Who hath not watch'd the heaven of eve] (1825.) Who hath not watch'd the heaven of eve, When round the horizon seems to weave A sea of clouds, whose bosoms heave In floating beauty, there? Those lovely phantoms, how they glide, In all their calm and airy pride, Moved by the breath of eventide Along the dew-lipp'd flowers! Some, crimson-wove, voluptuous sail; Some, girdled with a ruby veil; And others, beaming brightly-pale As Beauty's pensive brow. And thus smiles now this rose-wreathed room, Where float along in braid and plume All blushing with their virgin bloom The maidens of the night. Lo, yonder trips a blue-eyed troop, Who bend their glowing heads and droop, As graceful as a lily-group All languid with perfume. And near them glides a gentle pair That dance their grape-like clustering hair, As if their very ringlets were Communing with their joy! On each fair cheek a life-blush warms, While, radiant with expressive charms, The virgins twine their ivory arms And circle through the dance. Like moon-gleams shivering on the lake Their feet with dizzy motion shake, As down the dance their steps they take With love-beams in each eye. Then, why, amid this heaven of joy Should dreams of darkening woe annoy, Or thoughts of blighting gloom destroy The elysium of the hour? Alas! the scene will swiftly fade; The music cease; depart the maid, And cold-eyed Day the room invade, With uncongenial smile! Some hearts will pine, and some will weep, And many in the grave will sleep, And every eye shall sorrow steep Ere we unite again! Yes, many a Shape of love and light Whose eyes are glittering with delight Like starry Dreams that visit night, Shall wither into clay! A SAD THOUGHT. I love the present; but the past Hath such a spell around it cast, That oft from all I hear or see I turn, dead Time! to gaze on Thee; And o'er the grave of buried hours Bid Memory strew her pallid flowers! THE TOMB OF GRAY. (1836.) The poetry of dreams that spot surrounds Where Genius ponder'd; when oblivion's pall In mocking darkness on the tomb of kings Descendeth, memories bright and deep pervade The quiet scene where once a Bard has been. For him the laurel deathless! when the wreath Dyed by the blood of Victory's crowning hand Withers to nothing on the warrior's brow, How many a foot, where pensive Gray hath roved, Will love to linger! 'Tis the spell of mind Which consecrates the ground a Poet trod; With living thoughts the air is eloquent, And fine impressions of his favour'd muse; While Inspiration, like a god of song, Wakes the deep echoes of his deathless lyre. In the calm glory of declining eve 'Twas mine to wander where the tomb of Gray In green seclusion stands. Around me smiled A Landscape, veil'd with sunlight's pallid robe Of beauty, over tree and landscape drawn. On such, (by contemplation's dream enticed Like Isaac, oft at eventide to muse) The Bard had gazed; and drew from Nature's heart How many a touch of grace, and tone of song! While Eton, with her turrets grey, her towers Antique, in azure distance frown'd; Or round him, in their rich confusion, throng'd The sounds that wait on sunset's balmy hour:— The lay of birds; the sheep-bell's lowly chime; The chirping insect in the grass conceal'd; The bough made vocal by the exciting breeze; Or shout of home-returning shepherd boy, And city-hum,—all charm'd his dreaming ear. But, lo, the churchyard! Mark those “rugged elms,” That “yew-tree shade,” yon “ivy-mantled tower,” And thread the path where heaves the “mouldering heap;” Then, Stranger! thou art soulless earth indeed, If the lone Bard beside thee does not stand Form'd into life by Fancy's moulding spell! 'Twas here he mused; here Poetry and Thought, And Silence, their enamour'd Sister, came; And Taste and Truth their kindred magic blent, And proud Attempt, and pure Conception rose, While Melody each chord of mind attuned; Till soft Religion, like an Angel, smiled, And bade his genius make the grave sublime. Sweet Bard! whose mild and meditative lays, Or lyric numbers, warm with classic fire, Heal the torn mind, or thrill young Memory's heart With deathless pleasure, Time hath not despoil'd Thy crown poetic of one glorious leaf: Yet many, since thine eyes in death were veil'd, Have grasp'd the laurel; harps of witching tone, And thrilling strains of more impassion'd swell, Round the rich world of Poesy have flung Enchantment,—yet thy page is precious still. And wherefore? 'Tis because the moral heaven Remains unsullied by thy words, and dreams: And hence, amid the Babel-voice of song, In such pre-eminence to thy calm powers Accorded. Thus, when lays corruptly-sweet, The flash and fire of o'er-excited verse And mock intensity, have ceased to charm, Back to thy page, by purity inspired, The Heart returns; and finds a magic there Of thoughts which bloom beyond the earth's decay: And hence, when Stars of more ambitious light Shine dimly through the hazy depths of Time, Bard of the Soul! for ever wilt thou reign An Orb of beauty in the heaven of song. Whittington, near Oswestry, Shropshire. THE MINSTREL'S FUNERAL. “Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.”—Gen. xv. 15. “The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.”—Prov. xvi. 31. “Even to your old age I am He; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you.”—Is. xlvi. 4. A Christian never dies; in coffin'd dust What though he slumber, and the speechless grave With cold embrace his pallid form receives, Religion, like the shade of Christ, appears To heaven-eyed Faith beside the tomb to smile; And from her lips, seraphically fired, Rolls the rich strain, “O Death! where now thy sting? O Grave! thy victory, where?”—extinguish'd both, And baffled; stingless Death, and strengthless Law Together round the Cross like trophies hung Self-vanquish'd; Death himself in Jesus died! The Christian never dies; his dying hour To him a birth-day into glory proves: For then, emerging fetterless and free From this dark prison-house of earth and sin, (All sensual dimness like a veil withdrawn) In mystic radiance soars the seraph-mind To regions high and holy; where the Truth Essential, Beauty's uncreated form, And Wisdom pure, in archetypal state To souls unearth'd their trinal blaze reveal.— Unchain the eagle, break his iron bars, And when aloft, on wings exultant poised, Sunward he sweeps through clouds of rolling sheen And makes the blue immensity his home, Go, mark him! while the flash of freedom breaks Forth from each eye-ball, in its burning glee; And there, the imaged rapture of a mounting Soul When prisonless, from out the body pure, May fancy witness!—far away it flies, And where the Sun of Righteousness enthroned, Eternal noon-tide round His ransom'd pours, Basks in the smile of glory, and of God! And thus of thee, the venerably-good, The mild old Man with apostolic mien, Let memory in some heavenward moment, think; Thou art not dead, but from thy bondage free! Alive, as in the sunbeam lives the mote, Art thou, encinctured with the blaze of heaven In that Assembly, where the crown'd ones chant, With robes blood-whiten'd by the wondrous Lamb. Oh, what a sunburst of immortal truth In keen effulgence on thy spirit broke When forth, from out the fettering walls of flesh It soar'd!—the dull eclipse of death no more, The daylight of eternity begun! Thy bed around, while children knelt and pray'd, And sorrow trembled into tears and sighs, Thine was the song ecstatically-loud From harping Angels, and from hymning Saints In concord, round the throne of Jesu raised! And who, when gospel-music charm'd thine ear, Or promises with preciousness divine Deep-laden, lighted up thine aged eyes With more than youth's glad lustre,—who that heard Thy holy breathings for the better Land, And did not from his eyelids dash the tear Of mourning, when he thought, that thou wert there! In that pure Home of perfect light and peace At length arrived! to that bright City brought, Whose silver-turrets oft thy faith beheld, When down the streets Imagination walk'd, By angels, and the Church's first-born lined! Around that tomb, where thy cold ashes sleep, The unbought homage which a good man wins 'Twas mine to witness, when the gather'd crowd Attended, with a train of weeping Hearts Who knew thee best, and therefore mourn'd thee most. And well that Scene thy pure and placid life Betoken'd; Feeling deck'd thy funeral; The moral blazonry of Christian grief Was there, and touchingly the whole array'd With more than splendour,—with the truth of tears! The hoary Minster, eloquent as vast, Lifting its forehead with cathedral-grace, Whose form revered some twice three hundred years Have girt with grandeur, like a zoning spell That binds bewitchingly; the tombs antique By jagged walls, in sculptured ruin bent; The graves of myriads, like a sea of mounds In swells of grass on all sides rank'd, and ranged In death's confusion,—till their cited dust Leaps into life beneath the trumpet blast Of Time's archangel, striding Earth and Sea! The rock-hewn church-yard, with its green uprise Of monumental landscape, where the grief Of Nature, and the grace of Sculpture vie In soft contention, each expressing each, And hiding death between them, by the spell That o'er the grimness of the grave is thrown; All this, while high in front, severely-calm, The fearless Knox in stony grandeur frown'd,— Together met, a scene of soul combined, And made one Sentiment the whole become Of sacredness and silence! Childhood hush'd Its laugh; and Youth each lawless smile forewent; And the mute Crowd a single mourner seem'd, When slowly, to its last long home was borne Thine earthly portion! Heaven the better took; Thy tomb within, one farewell-gaze we had,— The heart out-speaking with a tongue of tears, While friend on friend a look of meaning turn'd, And said no more! The soul must speak above; No language learns it in this world of graves And gloom; for silence forms a spirit-voice, When Faith and Feeling by the tomb embrace. Pure on the bosom of almighty Love From sin and sorrow thou art resting now: And who would bring thee, might availing tears Be answer'd, back to this cold earth again! To peace and glory, to perfections high Around thee smiling, rather may we mount On these sure wings of faith that carried thee; And o'er the track thy saintly virtues trod Her way let holy Imitation wend, Her eye on Him intently fix'd, and firm,— Our bright Precursor to the Cross and crown! And now, farewell! If age's hoary charm; If gentleness, with solid worth combined; If faith and truth, by patriarchal grace Bedeck'd; if boundless love, that god-like smiles Serenely, over Sects and Names enthroned; If these were thine; with all the enriching spell Of temper, cloudless as the crystal noon, And feelings, tuned by every tender call; While round about thee hung the glow Of youth's gay morning, by the eve of age Subdued, like spring and autumn's blended smile,— Then, o'er thy grave recording Truth may bend; And drop, not undeserved, the simple wreath Of memory, a Muse has ventured now. Farewell! A few more rolling suns and years Will yon dark Minster from his turret speak Of Time's departure, with an iron-voice Wailing a hollow dirge o'er life's dead Hours, And the roused Earth at ev'ry pore will heave Around thee! Myriads from their pulseless clay In throbbing consciousness shall rise, and bound Warm into being!—What a mass of life Under the trumpet's dead-awaking call Will stand, and tremble in the gaze of God! And thou wilt rise; nor rock, nor mountain seek To crush thee, from the piercing eye of Him Array'd in lightnings of resistless glare,— Immanuel! on the Judgment's burning throne Of glory, wheeling through the heaven of heavens. And when creation in a tomb of fire Shall welter, and the wicked lift a cry Of quenchless agony, beneath the frown Of truth's Avenger, undismay'd thine eyes Will greet Him; thou shalt look on God, and live! PROVIDENCE. Frail king of dust, Man loves to look around, And think,—“for me the elements abound With life and motion; shade and sunshine wait In mixt attendance on my human state; Light, sea, and air, their glorious spell maintain That I alone, as Lord of Earth, may reign!” And yet, what art thou?—but a fleeting breath, A pulse of life which throbs away in death! Myriads of creatures round thee move and die, Minute beyond the ken of mortal eye; Perfect as thine, their bright existence teems With beauty, in a paradise of beams; Or in some crystal-world of water play A floating populace of insects gay; And He who bade exalted Man to be An Image of His own eternity, Alike to them a form and feature gives, And not a mote but in His mem'ry lives! IN MEMORIAM C. H. E. M. Vanish'd Infant! years have fled Since thou wert coffin'd, pale and cold; Yet, to me thou art not dead, But still mine inward eyes behold The fairy brow, and form, and cherub feature Perfect as when they graced the living creature. Little dream unloving Hearts Which never thrill'd with parent-gladness, Seldom from the soul departs A shade of unpartaken sadness, Cast by the death of some sweet babe who died, As though this World its young soul terrified. Coil'd within man's secret mind Mysterious chords of feeling dwell; But they ne'er their charms unwind Till something wakes their dormant spell, When lo! at once with magic life they move Deeper than passion, but divine as love. Ever thus, in casual street A nursling pillow'd on the breast If alone I chance to meet, How oft it brings a fond unrest!— The aching flutter of a wordless thought With more than mem'ry in full action fraught. Almost in my hand I feel The cling and clasp of baby-fingers, And a life-breath o'er me steal Which faintly ebbs, and fondly lingers; Till once again a cradled form I see, And breathe, dead Flower! a father's prayer for thee. Like a dove-wing in the sky Melted and mingled with soft light, Hast thou faded from an eye That when it saw thee, grew more bright; But still, in love's eternity thou art A living infant to thy father's heart. DIVINE OMNISCIENCE. Mere chance exists not; 'tis a libel dread On Providence, which those unblest of mind, Poets of Vice, and laureates of Despair, Often pronounce,—who into merest fate The motions of our moral world resolve. For, God o'er all eternally presides; And, from the quiver of the bladed grass, To wheeling Systems, hung in starry space Enormous as unnumber'd,—all occurs How, when, and where, His guiding will decrees. And we, who now with backward-gaze revolve The hoary annals of Mosaic time, Behind the curtain of that outer-scene Where man was acting, view His prompting Hand At work for ever: Hist'ry's moving form Points like an index to that secret God; E'en as the timepiece, which the hour reveals, The hidden motion of a main-spring shows. SOVEREIGNTY OF DIVINE GRACE. Goodness to all may infinitely come, But pard'ning Grace for sinners only, acts. And thus, o'er evil triumphs endless good Beyond all words (save what in Heaven they speak) Rightly to equal with o'ertaking praise, Or rapture. Yet, in this a Will Supreme Itself must glorify, by calling whom The counsel of the Holy One decreed To make a monument of grace divine Ere Time to count his awful hours began. Yes, though in justice no election acts, But each award to character applies With truth unerring; yet, when Mercy smiles, Prerogative alone the Godhead shows Unquestion'd, such as men, nor angels, scan, Nor measure.—Motive God hath none; For that, from His completeness steals a ray, And on the orb of true Perfection casts A veiling shadow: Motive, End, and Aim, All in Himself eternally abide. His reasons are His attributes alone; And each vast grace the Trinity unfolds In mercy's fulness, acts divinely-free. THEOLOGY FOR MOTHERS. And, oh, fond mothers! whose mysterious hearts Are finely-strung with such electric chords Of feeling, that a single touch, a tone From those ye fondle, some responsive thrill Awakens, when at night, a last long look Which almost clings around the form it eyes, Ye take of slumb'ring Infancy, whose cheeks Lie softly pillow'd on the rounded arm, Rosy, and radiant with their dimpling sleep,— Well may ye waft upon some wingèd prayer A grateful anthem to your Lord enthroned, Who, once an Infant on His mother's knee, Not in His glory childhood's life forgets! For He, while systems, suns, and countless worlds Hang on His will, and by His arm perform Their functions, in all matter, space, and time, Can hear the patter of an infant-foot, List to the beating of a mother's heart, Or, seal the eyelid of some babe at rest. A MOURNFUL TRUTH. But, like the lustre of a broken dream, How soon the fairy grace of morning-life Melts from the growing child! Corruptive airs Breathed from an atmosphere where sin is bred, Around them their contaminating spell Exhale; and Custom, with its hateful load Of mean observances, and petty rites, Bends into dust those Instincts of the skies In the pure heart of genuine Childhood seen, And, so enchanting! Then, comes artful Trick, With forced Appearance, and the feeling veil'd, When Fashion's creed or Folly's plea forbids A free expression. These, with blending force The sweet integrities of Youth assail For ever: mar the delicacy of mind, And from the power intact of conscience take Its holy edge; and soon the Child impress With the coarse features of corrupted Man. And, add to this, how omnipresent sin, That from the womb of being to our grave Infects our nature with a fiendish blight, Will act on passions earthly, and desires Malignant, base, or mutinously warp'd From virtue,—and, alas, how quick we find The vestal-bloom of Innocence depart! Then, what remains of all that blessèd prime, That blooming promise, which the fair-brow'd Child Of beauty gave in home's domestic bowers?— Lisping God's love beside parental knees, And seeming oft, as if the Saviour's arms Had compass'd them, and left a circling spell Round his soft being! Where, oh! where is gone The unworn freshness of that fairy Child? GOD'S INFANTS. Yes! eloquent, and touching more than tears, Those incarnations of maternal dreams,— Infants, by Beauty's plastic finger shaped, Have ever been: in all their ways and moods A winning power of unaffected grace Poetic faith, or pious fancy, views. Wild as the charter'd waves, which leap, and laugh By sun and breeze rejoicingly inspired, Till the air gladdens with the glowing life They shed around them,—who their happy frame Can mark; or listen to their laughing tones; Behold their gambols, and the fairy gleams Of mirth which sparkle from their restless eyes, Nor feel his fondness to the centre moved Beyond a mere emotion? But, to watch The tendrils of the dawning mind come forth, The buds and petals of the soul expand Day after day, beneath a fost'ring care And love devoted,—this Religion deeply loves! How the Great Parent of the universe The outward to the inner-world hath framed, With finest harmony; and for each sense Some region of appropriate joy secured, Philosophy may there, with reverence, learn, As grows the virgin-intellect of youth Familiar with all forms, effects, and moods Of Nature, in her majesty or might. And, what a text on Providence we read In the safe life of shielded Infancy! For, who can count the multitude of Babes That look more fragile than the silken clouds Which bask upon the bosom of the Air They brighten,—God's o'ershading Hand secures! And number, if Arithmetic can reach The total, what a host of tiny feet Totter in safety o'er this troubled world! Though all around them throng, and rage Destructive Elements, whose faintest shock Would strike an infant into pulseless clay. HEAVEN POPULOUS WITH INFANT SOULS. Then, look not lightly on a pensive child Lest God be in it, gloriously at work! And blind Irrev'rence touch on truths, and powers And principles which round the Throne are dear As holy. Never may our hearts forget That Heaven with infancy redeem'd is full; Crowded with babes, beyond the sunbeams bright And countless. Forms of life that scarcely breathed Earth's blighting air, and things of lovely mould Which, ere they prattled, or with flowers could play, Or to the lullaby of watching Love Could hearken, back to God's own world were call'd: And myriads, too, who learnt a prayer to lisp, Bend the soft knee, and heave Devotion's sigh, Or caroll'd with a bird-like chant the psalms Of David, with the Church in Heaven are found. THE HEART'S SANCTUARY. And thus, there is a loneliness of heart, In all deep souls a never-enter'd shrine; Where neither love, nor friendship takes a part, Which no eyes witness, but, Jehovah! Thine. But, shall we mourn, that each is circled round With veiling mystery from the ken of man? That waters deep within the soul abound No word has fathom'd, and no wisdom can? No, rather let such merciful disguise Move the just thinker unto grateful prayer; For, who could live beneath terrestrial eyes If such could witness all secreted there! And if no mantle by our God were thrown Round fallen souls, to hide man's world within, How should we hate, what now we love to own, And cry for darkness to conceal our sin! “THE HOLY CHILD JESUS.” How beautiful the brow of Jesus was, Methinks Imagination's hallow'd dreams Would fain adumbrate. Virgin-born was He! Not shaped by sin, but, through o'ershading power Divinely-perfect, His conception took Human Reality in flesh and form Embodied. Never did one taint of earth, A touch of sensual feeling, or a tone Of temper, harshly-loud, or rudely-quick, Assail the soul of that mysterious “Child.” And therefore, Beauty's most ethereal power Haply upon His forehead's arching grace Was throned; and from His eye's divine appeal Broke a soft radiance, exquisite and deep; Or, on His lips pure Inspiration sat; While from the glory of His heaven-born face There beam'd expression on the gazer's mind, Awfully mild, and full of melancholy; And, like the cadence of an Angel's sigh, Could such be sadden'd, moving more than tears. REASON AND FAITH. By Unbelief our primal nature fell From light to darkness; and by Faith it mounts Back to the glory whence its pureness sank: But still, that fatal tyranny of Sense, Which Adam first around the virgin-soul Allow'd to cast its paralysing chain, Abides; and needs a disenchanting spell Beyond mere Reason, in its brightest noon, To shame or silence.—Yes, the Felt, the Seen, And Tangible, alone appears the True! Our touch must regulate the law of truth, And to the Body must our high-born Soul Stoop like a slave, before the mind admits Motives divine, and miracles of grace, Or myst'ries, where the Infinite Unknown Enshrines His nature, and His love reveals. Yet, 'tis the madness of outrageous pride, The dismal lunacy of self-esteem; And Reason here a suicide becomes, When god o'er God it thus presumes to be, And dwarfs the Everlasting down to Man! But, faith is reason in its noblest form; And boasts an evidence most heavenly-bright, Sublimely-equal to our Spirit's need, In whatsoe'er submissive Love believes From Deity derived, our world to save. For, breathe we not the Church's sainted air Where all is fragrant of the truths of old? And ritual Forms, and ceremonial Types, With each high record of auxiliar sway, Historic truths, traditionary lore, And monuments of sacramental Grace,— These have we not? And, though rejecting pride Back on the blaze of this commingled orb Of evidence, a sneer presume to cast, Yet, have the wise and wondrous to such light Their hearts submitted, and repose enjoy'd. And, more than this, a clear-eyed wisdom finds: For if unrisen were our spirit's King, Then long ere this the Galiléan Lie Had vanish'd!—for the Creed its claims involve, Binds on the world offensive purity Which flesh endures not: and if Christ were dead, Tomb'd in the darkness of sepulchral clay, How could His promise with our souls to be Present for ever,—still on earth be proved Infallible, through faith's unbounded world? A living Christian proves a living Christ As firmly to the soul, as if the heavens Were now uncurtain'd, and our eyes entranced Look'd through the Veil and saw Him shining there In glory, bright as what the Martyr view'd, When Stephen mounted from his mangled clay In bleeding triumph, to his Master's breast. GOD IN MATERIALISM. God in creation is a glorious thought; Making the Matter, which we touch, or see, Like mute religion on our senses act; And to all forms and faculties of Things A power imparting, more than mere delight. 'Tis thus, in nature God alone we hail The ground of Being, and the grace of all That in this temple of Creation stands. No dead Abstraction, no almighty Law To faith suffices:—Life itself is God In will, and wisdom, actively employ'd: It spurns the idol, Second Cause, and springs On to the Infinite and only First! Creation a Theocracy becomes, When thus perceived; intelligibly ruled By that Great King, Whose hidden sceptre sways Alike the dew-drop, and the host of worlds. And, blest is he, who thus through nature walks Companion'd by its Author! Scenes and sounds Are unto him as Tokens of His power, Perpetual Teachers of mysterious love. Feeling the work, but Faith the worker views Devoutly: and the pomp of heaven's display, The floor of ocean, the green face of earth, And each variety which Objects wear, With more than language to his mind appeals, Proclaiming Him, Whose Power no sabbath keeps But quickens nature with incessant laws. And how this acts where'er we walk, or muse! Freshens the grass, and beautifies the flower, Gives to the canopy of heaven a grace Beyond the symmetry of clouds to form; And so with reverence the soul attunes, The very air-song seems to warble truths Celestial; syllables by Angels toned, Haunt the pure breathings of the balmy wind Around us heard: and when along the shore Haply we roam, in some reflective dream When life hangs heavy on the grief-worn heart, The billows make a litany of sound Which half interprets what sad Thought suggests. God in creation!—'tis a Creed sublime Which makes all nature solemn; and the mind With such desire for veneration fills, The universe one vast Shechinah grows Whence Piety, creation's priestess, draws Prophetic glimpses, as the tribes of old Drew from the Breastplate, where the Urim gave Responsive radiance and unerring law. THE CHURCH IN CANADA. (INSCRIBED TO THE BISHOP OF TORONTO.) Records of Grace divinely move The Church's heart with hymnèd praise, When the deep thought, how guardian Love Has camp'd around her peril'd ways, In some high mood of heaven-born calm O'er mem'ry breathes a solemn balm; Till Christ Himself in shadows seems To rise upon Her ancient dreams. “For ever with you, I shall be,”— Here is Faith's charter, strong as heaven! Framed by incarnate Deity And to His mystic Body given, When, for Her mission-work on earth, The sacrament of second Birth Her Lord imparted; and the grace To spread it o'er earth's boundless race. Though manacled in murd'rous flame, The martyr'd herald of The Cross Hath gloried in Messiah's name And counted life, not death, a loss:— That Charter, like a living power Sustain'd him in some tortured hour; While viewless Angels, hov'ring nigh, Wafted to heaven his farewell-sigh. Yes, fire and sword, and dungeon-gloom, And all which Hell and Hate have done To bury truth in falsehood's tomb, And blast the triumphs Faith has won, The heroes of the Church have braved: And never left Her cause enslaved, Since all they suffer'd, fann'd the zeal Her sacramental Warriors feel. Thus Canada! thy church and creed Pure as our own, from England bred, When Loyalty was doom'd to bleed And banner'd Treason myriads led, A sworn allegiance nobly kept While havoc round thee raged, and swept,— Ark'd in the promise of thy Lord, And safe within His shelt'ring Word. By Lake Ontario's rocky shore Where creedless pagans once abounded, And exiles heard the torrent roar By wood and wilderness surrounded, Churches arise; and saintly Bands Have come from far and famous lands; And apostolic Symbols reign O'er rescued swamp and ransom'd plain. But never, till that Day of light When God shall grief and guilt disclose, Will thankless myriads learn aright What to her Church Canadia owes: For, social worth, and moral grace, Freedom divine, and all we trace Of present heaven in heart and home From Faith, and not from Culture, come. The churchless, soon, are godless, too! The unbaptised grow base and blind; And where no sacraments renew The sin-worn heart and earth-toned mind, All virtues die; all vices bloom; The soul becomes a sensual tomb, And men the Saviour yearn'd to cherish, Eternalise their guilt, and perish! Hence, laurell'd with a wreath of love Be Stuart's patriarchal name; While Langhorn, in the Church above With Addison, of kindred fame, May oft, perchance, the Past revive, And view salvation's harvest thrive From germs divine 'twas theirs to sow Through scorching years of toil and woe. THE INSPIRATION OF DREAMS. No incantation which the outer-sense In the full glow of waking life perceives, Rivals the magic by mysterious Night Evoked, when Dreams, like messengers from heaven Rise from eternity, and round the soul Hover and hang, ineffably-sublime; But mocking language, when it tries to catch The true expression of their awful power. And, how religious is the sway of Dreams, Which are the movers of that secret-world Where most we suffer, learn, and love, Building our Being up to moral heights, Stone after stone, by rising truths advanced To full experience, and to noble aims. The tombs of time they open, till the forms, The faces and the features of our Dead Lighten with life, and speech, and wonted smiles! While mem'ry beautifies the Thing it mourns, And to the Dead a deeper charm imparts Than their gone life in fullest glory had. And thus, in visions of the voiceless night, Apparel'd with that beauty which the mind Gives to the loved and lovely, when no more, Rise from their tombs the Forms of fleeted days, Friends of bright Youth, the fascinating-dear! Till back returns life's unpolluted dawn; And down the garden-walk, or cowslipp'd field Where once he prattled, full of game and glee, The man, transfigured back to childhood, roves Tender as tears. So, on the wind-bow'd mast The sailor-boy in dreams a mother hails, And hears her blessing o'er his pathway breathed; Or, pale and gasping, ere his life-drops ebb For ever, how the Soldier thus depicts In the soft dream of some remember'd day, The hands which rear'd him; or the hearts that heaved With omens, when the charm of tented fields Seduced him from the sweets of sainted home And virtue. Dreams are thus half-miracles; All time they master; and all truths embrace Which melt the hardest, and our minds affect With things profounder than our Creed asserts. SACREDNESS OF INFANCY. A dew-drop, trembling on the stem of Life; A rose-bud peeping into fairy bloom; A billow on the Sea's maternal breast Leaping, amid some jubilee of airs By glad winds caroll'd; or, a dancing beam Of sunlight, laughing in its brightest joy; In truth, whate'er is delicate and soft, Minute and fragile, innocent or gay, Oft to the mirror of the mind presents Types of that beauty which a tender babe To feeling Manhood's fascinated eye Affordeth; touch'd at times with solemn hues, Which Hearts prophetic cannot fail to cast Round a frail Heritor of life unknown! But, when o'er Revelation's book we bend, There do we find, with more than love confirm'd, Whatever Nature by her mute appeals Hath prompted: for the Bible e'en to babes Lends the sweet mercy of its soft regard And bland protection. Other creeds may scorn Such aidless Being; and the gibing laugh Of Science o'er their frailness may uplift Its godless péan; but in this we boast,— That Christianity the cradle seeks, Stoops to a babe with condescending brow; And while the Pagan, by her creed transform'd From yearning softness into heartless stone, Commits her infant to broad Ganga's stream Foodless to perish, Christ in Spirit comes, Commands the Priesthood on its forehead plant The sealing water, and the mystic sign, And bids it welcome to His Ark of grace. CHRIST IN THE HEART'S CLOUD. He stood before her, but she could not see That Holy One: and oh! how often, thus, The sad experience of a stricken mind Like Mary, cannot view the Lord it loves, Though in the mercy of our ev'ry breath, And in the promise of His perfect Word, In prayer, and praise, and sacramental life, Together with that unbreathed thought which tells Home to the heart acceptance in the skies, When the free spirit of assuring grace Glows in our bosom,—though in each and all Christ to the conscience doth himself present, Yet, Mary-like, the soul mistakes Him, still! Some carnal shade, or clouding sin prevents; And the high faculty of seeing Faith Grows undiscerning; or, in nature's eye The tear of sorrow doth so thickly stand, That through it, God himself grows unbeheld A moment: nothing but dark grief is seen! WORLDLINGS. How much Anxiety the heart corrodes Wasting the moral health of man away,— We seldom ponder, till too late perceived! When, under burdens, which ourselves inflict, The Intellect of half its glorious life Is sapp'd, while conscience turns a crippled thing; The heart gets agèd ere the head grows old, And those bright virtues, which might nobly shine In that clear firmament of thought and power Where lofty Manhood would exult to act, Rarely, if ever, into influence dawn. For else the grandeurs, graces, charms, and scenes, The smiles of matin, and the shades of night, Sun, moon, and star, wild mountains and glad seas, Meadows and woods, and winds and lulling streams, With fruits, and flowers like hues of paradise Amid us scatter'd,—would so well impress The moral being, that responsive Mind Upon the Beautiful would back reflect An answer, most intelligibly pure, To each appeal of Beauty. But the World Can so infect the myriads of mankind, That all those latent harmonies, which link Nature to man by loveliness and might, Lie undiscern'd; and though a spirit deep, A living sentiment of love and truth, In all Creation cultured souls may find, How few perceive it! but, on objects gaze With eye unmoved; as if by God unmade Their beauties, and by Him unform'd their powers! Nature to them in all her shrines is mute; Nor to Her mystic oracles, which yield Such music to Imagination's ear, Can the cold worldling condescend to list. THE PEOPLE AND PRAYER BOOK. Nor be forgot, that England's Prayer Book gives Pure, full and plain, The Word by which she lives; Not dungeon'd in some dead and alien tone, But where the peasant-boy perceives his own. There, lisping Childhood, when it longs to learn Truths for which Prophets bled, and Martyrs burn, In such pure liturgy of grace may find All which can feed the heart, and form the mind. For, Common Prayer, if catholic and true, Must not be tinged with individual hue, But be proportion'd to the soul of Man, In deep accordance with Redemption's plan. INDIVIDUAL PROVIDENCE. And, there are moments, when mysterious Life Is so attended with a train of Facts Sudden and strange, through which a mercy glares With such intensity of sacred light Full on the conscience,—that Paternal care To us revealing God's elective will, Runs through the heart with overwhelming proof! And bids it, like ecstatic Hagar, cry, By Heaven when mercy-struck to more than prayer. And He, the Infinite by Form array'd, Who took our Nature in all sinless truth Into His Own, as Man embodied loved, In modes and shapes of individual cast. For, while in Providence th' unblemish'd Lord Moved on the lines of Justice and of Truth, Boundless, beyond respect of single homes Or spirits; He, in walks of social life Loved like a Man, and chose the friend He will'd: And hence, the winning might Emmanuel wields By His example! for, on Person, Place, And Time, His pure affections deign'd to shed Their fullness. He who wept a City's doom, As if the crashing of its crumbled walls Rang in his ear, while Roman butchers bathed Their swords in slaughter, also, by a grave Wept o'er the dead, most humanly perturb'd, And to His bosom took the mild St. John! A PRODIGAL'S RETURN. And now, behold him, wither'd, tatter'd, bow'd; Pale with long famine, wearily he drags His homeward-track; but, so by suff'ring worn, That through the village, where his boyhood dwelt, Unknown he steals, disguised in haggard woe. Oh, what a tide of memory there rolls, And what a gush of agony and grief Runs through his being, when that hill he gains, Climb'd in calm hours of vanish'd innocence, And underneath him in the sunset pale Looks on the landmarks of paternal home! Mute with remorse, amid the tranquil scene Awhile he ponders; till the silent forms Of Things grow eloquent with meek reproach: Meadow, and tree, and each familiar nook Instinct with meaning, to his mind appeals With more than language from Rebuke's harsh lip. For, Nature yet her old expressions wore, And each loved haunt remain'd familiar still. There, was the olive he had loved to watch; There, was the vine his infant hand had pluck'd; And there, a field-path, where he often paced As bright in spirit as the joyous beam Beside him, and with step as gaily-swift As the wild breeze which hurried o'er his head; Nothing look'd alter'd:—for, the fig-tree stood, And caught the day-gleam in its dying glow As oft his boyhood watch'd it, when he sat Under the twilight of its laden boughs And fondly wove his fancies; and, how sweet The lulling cadence of yon well-loved stream! E'en as of old, so wound its waters still In stainless beauty, down their pebbled way:— Nothing has changed; but, oh, how changed is He! MORAL INFLUENCE. Our moral centre is a point minute: But our circumference, oh! who can grasp, In action, suff'ring, or involved Result? A smile, a glance, a single breath, a tone, A look of meaning, or a laugh of scorn, The mere expression of the hectic mind Clothing our features,—each may, haply, thrill Some chord which touches by effectual ties Events unborn; and make th' eternity We dread, to vibrate with the deed we do! Oh! for a sense of Duty more sublimed, In all our ways, our wishes, and our words: A sense that we are links in that long Chain Of Consequence, which e'en from Adam's sin To our last error, its unbroken length So reaches, that we cannot act alone! But rather, each with each is so inwove By past connection, or by future power, That Conduct grows immortal; and the act From soul to soul with multiplying power, Itself repeateth, when the Agent sleeps In cold oblivion, by the world forgot. The blemish'd morals and the blotted mind How often thus our Rev'rence would escape! And 'stead of reckless pride, religious care The paths would purify where Virtue walks, And solemnize existence. Action, then, Inward, or bodied forth in social form, Of sacredness in every sphere would breathe; Till the whole Earth a mystic Temple grew Hallow'd by God, by angels overwatch'd, And by Humanity in all its moods Devoutly-trodden: then would Duty spread Its canopy above our ways and walks, E'en as the heaven o'ervaults the varied earth For ever: Faith would be our Law supreme, And guarded Life one long religion prove. THE LAKE OF BEAUTY. A MORNING SCENE AT VEVAY. Lake Leman! in the hush of this deep hour The poetry of waters is thy power; And o'er my spirit steals that lulling calm Which bathes the earth in some celestial balm. Here from my window, with a spell-bound gaze, I view yon shore beneath a silver-haze Unshroud its glories; till, with dim uprise The Alpine summits cleave the sun-lit skies. Far to the east, those mountain-kings enthrone Their rocky grandeurs o'er the ice-born Rhone, Whose foreheads, pure as angel-brows, present Their dazzling whiteness to the Firmament. And who can mark thine awful Mountains gleam, When faintly-hued with morn's seraphic beam; Or, crimson'd o'er with magical array Caught from the rosy death of ling'ring day, Nor feel them, like an infinite Control,— Embodied hymns, where Silence to the soul Speaks more of God, than thunder, wave, or wind, With dark-wing'd Terrors, from the storm combined? Thus may true Poets from their presence gain Fresh purities, which o'er the conscience reign; Till thoughts grow vaster than the lyre can own, And Man seems lifted to his Maker's throne. But, Leman! once again to thee I turn, And from thine everlasting beauty learn Profounder Wisdom than a sage can teach, Whose words are bounded by the sense's reach. While soft, yet stern, though mild, majestic too, Serenely-bright, and exquisitely-blue,— Almighty Taste around thy scene hath cast What makes thy loveliness the unsurpass'd! For ever varied!—rock, and terrace, field, Vineyards and turrets, tower and village yield A concentrated Spell, which thus imparts A more than landscape to melodious hearts. And seldom, since the bend of beauteous skies Enrich'd thy waters with reflected dies, Hast thou, fair Leman! more ideal bliss For mind created, than on morns like this. The grace, the gentleness, and glow of heaven Now to thy charms are so intensely given, That on thy waveless sea of fairy sound The Heart seems floating, as we gaze around. And hark! the drip of yon descending oar In wafted grace as glides the boat ashore, With what a cadence it enchants the ear, And drops in radiance, like a dazzling tear, Down on the waters!—where a breezy strife Makes Leman palpitate with rippling life, And liquid glances, as the broken sun Laughs on the dimpled stream it lights upon. Earth, air, and sky, and range of rocky pass, Glaciers, and crags, and sternly-wild morass, The bird, and foliage, field and distant towers, Vine-mantled hills, and fancy-haunted bowers, Blent with the mellow chimes of matin-bell Heaved o'er the Lake with deep and dying swell,— Oh! how can words such pictured Whole combine, Or Leman roll through this imperfect line? E'en like a Consciousness of sound and scene Nature doth now her master-spells convene; And lovingly this hour for man array As though She treasured what his eyes survey; While leafy murmurs from yon flutt'ring trees Quiver abroad like new-born ecstasies, And gleams come dancing down the golden air, As though bright angels hover'd everywhere. Yet, in mine incapacity of speech This lulling paradise of Lakes to reach, Still can I feel, that even thus the soul Bows in its unbreathed thought to that Control Which God intended, Who to scene imparts Predestined magic, framed for deathless hearts, Whose pulse with His eternity shall glow— When Earth has vanish'd like an air-born show. A purifying calm of central power Attunes high feeling to this chasten'd hour; And from the World's more artificial scene, Oft shall it woo me to this Lake, I ween. Meanings divine endow a Morn like this With magic that outsoars an earth-made bliss; The very soil grows sanctified and fair, And deepens poetry to silent prayer. Beauty is hallow'd, when on mind it leaves An impress grander than mere Sense conceives; Till all without, within, below, above, Becomes transfigured to almighty Love. And thus, that God from Whom vast nature flows Inspires religion through the heart's repose; And so connects it with creation's plan That heaven seems throbbing through the earth on Man!</field>
