      <field name="fulltext">[Released at last! Released from agony!] Released at last! Released from agony! The Lord hath answered thus our pleading cry; And thou hast gone! Sweet peace upon thy brow— In heaven now. Yes, gone! The perfumed flower he loved so well No longer hath aërial tale to tell The glad green earth; the vocal air is mute As broken lute. Gone? Not gone; for, like a nestling bird, Creeps back into our heart his quiet word, And, with the music of a hidden rill, Sings to us still. No filmy veil shall fall 'twixt us and thee; But, rather, thou shalt help our eyes to see That thou art closer—dearer—than before Death oped his door. REUBEN. A Dramatic Poem. ACT I. Scene I. A Room. Several young men seated around a table. First Speaker. Another name would make our list complete; And since our number is to be restricted, I should advise we look about for one Having some quality that we yet want. Knows any one where Reuben spends his nights? He used to come amongst us; but of late He might be dead, or married.—Have you mark'd How friendships, be they ever so alive, Grow cold and die without a special cause? Second Speaker. Nothing is fix'd: the granite ribs that shield The continents from the besieging sea, Are being lick'd into soft layers of sand. In time the dogged sea will have his day. Where cities lie i' the sun, where sickles glance, Where lovers walk in lanes, and cottages Wreathe up their lazy smoke in sylvan nooks, There will be nothing then but sea, blue sea! A sea of change is ever in our hearts, Ebbing and flowing; blotting out the lines That character our present, and anew Giving our life its margin. Our old loves Embedded lie, like strata out of date. Yet who can say they will not rise again For other, and it may be higher, use? Buried formations, older than the flood, Come up and serve the wants of this our day. Third Speaker. We are like beads in a kaleidoscope; And as time moves it round and round, we slip Out of one fellowship into another, In hue and form all different: yet through all Runs the old beauty both of form and hue. Fourth Speaker. Or like a pack of cards play'd by the gods: And as they shuffle, cut, and deal us out, We find ourselves in many different suits;— Now link'd between a brace of arrant knaves With side-long glances, winking to each other; Now hand in hand with kingly sorts of men That look straight forward with bright royal eyes; Then in a company of jolly trumps, Breezy in mirth, with the world all at their feet, Carrying the game before them; and anon, Close quarter'd with dull miserable rags That lack the virtue of one living thought, And can but mutely wait till they are play'd. Fifth Speaker. The presences of men are double. This Which fills the eye and babbles to the ear, Is but the covert to a timid doe, Scarce ever to be seen upon the lawns, But marvellous in beauty when beheld. Words and side watchings keep that presence in. Behind the rags you speak of, there is that Which shrinks from your keen eyes.—In my school time. I had a cousin; and on holidays We ever were together: long, long days We wander'd in lone places, side by side; Or sat whole hours upon the river's brink, With not one word between us. Since he died I've sought in vain another silent mate: For every one will speak, or wish to speak, And thus we never can come near enough.— I dreamt one night there was a crowd of men, And not one spoke: all were rapt up in thought. But I could see their spirits coming out, And flitting, ghost-like, 'mid the silent frames, Communing with each other without speech. And when I woke I thought upon my cousin, And those long days in which we never spoke. Second Speaker. Let us be silent now: our ghosts will creep Out of their tenements, like mice at night When one sits in his slippers, and the fire Has wink'd itself asleep, and the haunting clock That had been still all day, goes like a sprite Ticking through all the house,—O, then they come Like little clues of worsted o'er the hearth, And peep about with their black diamond eyes, Till he's in love with them, and pleased to think That in the very house with him there are So many living things that he may love. Let us be quiet, then, we double men, And see our beauteous presences come out. But if we move a foot, or speak one word, Lord, what a splutter to regain their holes! First Speaker. They will not come to watchers: Nature gives To the unconscious only, things divine.— Our list still wants a name. I mentioned one, And that one for this reason. There are some Whose natures are so mellow in themselves, They seem to mellow everything they touch; Most passive souls that put out no strong will, Their action being chymical. Unknown, E'en to themselves, they draw bad humours out, And drop on fever'd natures balmy dew. Reuben has that rare virtue. Fourth Speaker. Rare defect! For that it is defect in him is clear. He is so undecided in himself That he takes on the hue of any one, Be that black, white or green—sinner or saint, Or simple innocent; and any whim That any fool may broach, still finds in him Forbearance, and is even reflected back With added light on its enraptured sire. Rare virtue this! I call it rare deceit. First Speaker. O no, he is sincere, and only takes The good that will be found in all bad things. What if he tackle to a vice at times, And like an angler runs it with the stream? Trust me, before he leaves it, it will lie In all its bareness, strangled at his feet, Its weak side uppermost. Fourth Speaker. Not with a line, But with a net he fishes. All is fish That comes to Reuben's net—very good fish. Sixth Speaker. He has a strange one in it now, I hear— A very wary nibbler that has had Most choice baits offer'd to her. She comes up And sculls provokingly around the hook, Swinging her saucy tail; then makes a feint, As if about to take: the fisher's heart Is up and all on tip-toe for the sport. 'Twas but a nibble, and she's up the stream To play the same game with some other heart. The finest twisted lines, the daintiest hooks, With all old Izaak's art to boot, have fail'd To wile this sly one from her watery home. But Reuben comes, and in his blundering way, Using no art at all, casts in his net, When straight she falls into it, and is his. First Speaker. But has he landed her, and has he knelt Upon the soft green cushion by her side? Till then, who knows but she may use an art, The deeper in seeming none? I do not like A woman with the habits of a fish, Treating men's hearts as if they were mere baits For her especial self, and each conceal'd A barbed hook which she might rob, then leave. Your mermaids ever have deceivers been. Sixth Speaker. Of wooers she has fifty more at least, That ply her more than Reuben, and hold out Flattering inducement: he but lays his heart, Not in low fawning duty at her feet, But as a well, over whose brim she stoops, And sees she is the goddess of its deeps: And, gazing in, she finds her thoughts all lost In his soft love, which, like an azure sky, Is mirror'd deep beneath. So that, in him Her senses being lost, her art is gone, And love's fine madness leads her like a child. Second Speaker. The ladye love of fifty belted knights Would not go mad for one. But who is she That in her single bosom thus absorbs The dues of fifty maids? Sixth Speaker. You know the Inn, Over the river where the two roads meet And marry with each other on the bridge? That Inn, her sire has kept for many a year; And in the good old times when coaches ran, And carriers and drovers lined the roads, He fill'd his coffers. The good times went out, And railway trains had damn'd the house, when lo! Out of her girlhood's disregarded bud Burst Margaret into beauty, and became The house's saviour. Second Speaker. I see, I see: She sets about enlisting simple swains, And keeps them drinking for the house's good— Half drunk with love, and half with country ale. Her heart is sacrificed to save the house, And this you call the doctrine of salvation. Sixth Speaker. If men ask drink, it is no part of hers To serve them with sour looks. If they admire The sparkling light dancing in her black eyes, The fine dark stormy beauty in her hair, The dimpling cheek that mantles like a sea Flush'd by a ruddy sunset, is it then Her part to drive them from the house, which house, Being public, is as free to them as her? If fifty men would have her, she is led, Driven, perhaps against her fair intent, To use the arts I spoke of. First Speaker. And you say Reuben, of all the fifty, is the man! But since she is not yet securely his, He has his work before him; and our ends Were poorly served by the mere patch of heart That he could spare. Therefore, let each of us Think of some other friend, so that our list May be completed the next time we meet. [Exeunt. Scene II. The Bridge, and Road before the Inn. Enter Reuben, reading from a slip of paper. Reuben. ‘Love loves the moon and stars, and they love it, ‘And that's the reason lovers long for night. ‘Surely some love-god in the moon doth sit, ‘Throwing a witchery o'er lover's sight! ‘The sun hath no such glamour in his keeping: ‘He is a busy king, and wakes up man ‘To money-making, maid to scrubbing, sweeping— ‘Fixing their thoughts on lowly purse and pan. ‘But our soft sailing moon stoops not so lowly: ‘She is an idle queen: to her belong ‘Young hearts, sad eyes, and that sweet melancholy ‘Which floats on lover's sighs, in lover's song. ‘I do not love thee, sun; would thou wert set ‘That moon and stars may shine, and—Margaret.’ If 'twere not for this safety-valve of rhyme, Love's heart would burst.—Now is the western sky, Like the Pacific with its clustering isles, Fringed round with golden sands and warm green sea. From yonder one a little speck puts out, And glides like a canoe across a bay.— To be a dweller on some tropic isle, Where nature grows in plenty all we need, And leaves us nought to do but love and dream, Were fitting to my spirit. Yet I seek That which is most unlike it, and love best The company of stirring, restless souls— E'en when they have a devil in their blood; And thus methinks in Margaret's black eyes My second nature leaps, the complement Of this I call myself. Like a still lake Circled with hills, I drowse throughout the day, And live in mere reflection; till eve falls, When Margaret sweeps o'er me like a wind That from some mountain gully comes at night, And stirs the lake to breezy, rippling life.— In all the evening's changes, in the woods, Along the breathing meadows, in the stream That lapses restlessly beneath this bridge, And through the blinking night, her spirit runs And gives to all this fine bewildering throb.— How sweetly up the river comes that knell! It is the old church telling it is nine. Ah, slumb'rously it speaks from the nodding wood! But merrily that ancient tongue will wag On Marg'ret's bridal morn.—Look! in the east, Behind yon trees, the big unshapely moon Moves like a white cow browsing in a thicket.— Rising and setting, day and night go on; They neither fail nor rest; and yet no soul Has any hand in their mysterious rounds!— Now are the heavens like a busy town Seen from a distance: as night deepens in, Lights start out one by one into the dark, And from the suburb's solitary lamps They thicken to a centre.—How I seek To enjoy the anticipation of a joy! I linger on this bridge, and sip and sip The overflowing beauty of the night, While Marg'ret, like a jewel in my cup, Lies at the bottom. Now a dozen steps Would bring me to her, yet I save them up.— But, see! O startled heart! 'tis she that comes, With taper in her hand to light that room; And now approaches with light springy limb To shut the darkness out. She looks abroad Into the vacant dark, but sees not me. O what a bounteous light is in those eyes! She is too lavish of it; yet, like founts, They seem no emptier, though they ever give.— Ah! beauty should not know when it is seen, And then 'twere more than beauty. She is gone; But does not know she has eclipsed herself. I will not yet go in: the house is full: Loud country voices; songs of boisterous key; Verses that burst the tune—too big by half; And choruses that break out anywhere.— To see her drill about 'mid this rough work Shows the rare mettle in her, but it blunts The finer edge of love. Another hour, And these rude brains will drop off to their rest.— I'll pace a magic-circle round my love To keep away all glamour—yea a mile Right round about her heart; and when I've done No one shall dare to cross it but myself. [Exit. Enter Spanker, coming from the Inn. Spanker. If she be not quite struck with me, it's strange! A very pleasant place, and good ale too. I'll come here often. Amidst all those louts, How she mark'd out the gentleman! Her eye Cast on them sharp reproof: it flooded me Like April with a shower of rainy light. And this before we had exchanged one word, More than—“A glass of so and so,” and—“Yes, sir.” When we drew near each other and remark'd Upon the day, the weather, and the crops— Although in truth I know not wheat from oats: Let's see, yes, oats grow bristles on their top, And wheat's that other thing—she was so pleased, I ventured nearer home, look'd round the bar, And, seeing all so shiny-like, remark'd, “Whoever has the management of this, Will make a rare wife to some lucky wight.”— “You think so, do you?”—After that, I saw From out the corner of mine eye, that she— Ay, more than once—scann'd me from head to foot; And as I left, she from a vase of flowers Took this, and placed it in my button-hole. It is a pink. I wonder what it means. I'll write to one of those cheap papers; they Give shrewd replies, and sometimes good advice.— 'Tis lucky I went in, yet merest chance! I've pass'd here many a time—seen her, no doubt; Not with my now illuminated eyes, But as the settlers saw for many years The golden clods, yet knew them not as gold.— I'll keep this Australasia to myself, And work it at my leisure. [Exit. Enter Bradbury, going to the Inn. Bradbury. I am old; That is, compared with her; but from the hints I got in conversation with her mother, That seems all in my favour. So it should. To mate her portion to a spendthrift youth, Were heartbreak to her parents; and the thought That their hard raked-up gains were being spent In madcap thriftlessness, would haunt their graves, And rob their aged bones of death's sweet rest. Great fears that plague the spirit in this life Do hang about it long time after death, Withholding it from bliss. But she herself Affects not lack-brain'd youth, and leans, I know, To large experience and the stable mind That age alone matures. I could invest Her money to advantage; could extend My present business, which, truth to say, Must have some capital to float it o'er The bars and banks of trade—ay—banks indeed!— Or if she'd have me landlord of this house— This jolly ringing hostelry—why then, To that I've no objection. Let me see; My draught is deep enough;—a landlord's paunch, Like to a tithebarn in the olden time, Should give reception to all kinds of goods, And stow them mixty-maxty. So could mine. I am no mewling milksop, but, though small, Season'd and tough. Then, I have wit to give A ready answer that will turn the mirth As 'twere against myself, the while I wink Within myself, and chuckle in my sleeve: And, when appeal'd to in disputes, I could Give artful judgment, favouring both sides, Drawing them on to bets and double gills. Then, there's the ready laugh to the lame joke; The affected interest in the maudlin talk, With, Yes—no—certainly—indeed! Thrown in to suit the drift of him that speaks: The sharp eye to anticipate the pipe That wants a light; the quick officious hand: The ready-reckoning thumb that counts out change Without the head's assistance. These have I.— Some one approaches! I will stand within The shade of this abutment till they pass. (Cock crows.) I like not that! I like not that! A cock Crowing at night, under a waning moon, Across a wooer's path, bodeth no good; And that's the big black cock with glossy wings— A pet of Marg'ret's—I fear some ill. (Crows again.) Enter Juniper and Friend going to the Inn. Juniper. Crow up my gallant bird, use all your nights; Your days are almost counted; they are few. Friend. You know the bird, then? Juniper. Know him! deuced well: They've only one, and he is Marg'ret's pet, The which I supersede. I've seen her waste More precious love on that black Spanish Don Than suited well my stomach; and he struts So rakishly about her petticoats— Friend. Lord! what privilege to give the Don. Juniper. He will be superseded: he is doomed. The other day, whilst lolling in the bar, Smoking my pipe, she knitting by my side, In bounced her father—“Margaret,” quoth he, “That cock has been at his old tricks again: A bed of radish seed! Not one seed left! 'Twill never do; we'll have him killed straight off.” “Yes, father, very well; but—not to-day.” Then, blandly smiling, “William,” whispered she, “We'll have him to the wedding breakfast—cold.” Bradbury. (aside) Ah, yes! I do but sleep, and dream all this. Friend. You're a lucky dog, Will. 'Tis a large house this; And all their own, too. Eh? Juniper. Yes, all our own, And a deal of land besides, man—quite a farm. You'll come and stay a month or two. Let's in— See how you like our ale. [Exeunt. Bradbury. (coming forward) Our ale! the snipe! The wedding breakfast too! What means the rogue? Have I a rival, then? He might be more! She would not play me false, and make the while A paction with an empty kite like that! No. There are men who whip into the past Much-wished for, barely possible events, And trot them out as facts before our eyes, Merely to be admired. Yet I have seen These overweening fools make that to be, By the mere assuming it already was: For if they work in metal soft enough, It cannot choose but run into their mould. That knave may damage me. I'll to her straight And damage him. I'll nick the hoops that gird His hollow cause: when next he moves his suit, 'Twill fall, like an old cask, into a heap Of rotten staves, beyond all setting up. Enter Car, half-drunk, coming from the Inn. Car. There need not be no bother. The owd folk may stay with us, or build themsel's a cottage. (Looks back, and surveys the house.) The same sign will do—at least very near— Bradbury. (striking him) You lie, 'twill not do. My name's John Bradbury; that is Richard Riccard. Car. Thou dasht owd foo'—if thee strikes me agean, I'll pic thee o'er the brig. What has thee to do wi' it? Didn't Merget tell me hoo was baun' to wed me in a week? Bradbury. Ah! this confirms me that I am asleep, And do but dream it all. I'll wake, and laugh To think what monstrous things are born in dreams; How that my pretty Margaret engaged To marry this rude clown; how that— Car. Call me a clown? Thou dash't owd foo', I'll punch thy heod. (Makes up to Bradbury, who runs off, and Car returns.) He said he was asleep! The owd foo's drunk. And call'd her his pretty Merget! Na, na, owd lad; I've spent more brass in the house than ever thee was worth; and I haven't spent it for nowt, naither. But I needn't spend no more now—hoo's safe enough. (Surveys the sign again.) It'll welley do as it is. His name is Richard; so is mine; Richard can stand. Then there's R-I-C-C-A-R—stop now,— C-A-R!—good lad, Dick, thy name's there already! A little peant and a brush to peant out R-I-C—and leave C-A-R-D—No, dang it, that would be Card! D must come down. I'm a trump; yet my name's not Card. Ha! ha! ha!—I had welley given her up when hoo gave in. Well, it's a long loan as never has a turn. I always said soa.—How goes? Enter Wheeler, going to the Inn. Wheeler. Good night, good night. [Exit. CAR.] A most unfortunate thing! I've kick'd myself ever since for my own stupidity. Why, it was like throwing herself at me; as much as to say, “Here, Jack, take me and all my undertakings; you've been a most persevering wooer, now comes your reward.”—I can read it no other way; 'tis plainer than plain. Her married cousin gets a child: while I sit drinking beside her on Saturday night, she claps into my hand a letter asking her to come to the christ'ning on Sunday and stand godmother: “And John,” says she, “you'll go with me and be godfather!” And then, John, she might have added, the next child we stand father and mother to will be our own. She meant as much, that's certain. —The time of starting was agreed on. At seven in the morning she would meet me at the town-end with the gig and black Dobbin, and then we would drive over together.—On the strength of this, I drink me ten glasses more of her best old ale, hand running, and leave her between twelve and one, promising, without fail, to be waiting her at seven. I bundle home, stumble into bed before I have time to take off my clothes, fall dead asleep, and wake at—nine! I then take double time to dress, having first to undress; and come running in blazing haste to the place appointed, without breakfast, and buttoning my waistcoat. No Margaret there, and two hours and three-quarters past the time! What a relief to find that she also had overslept herself! I begin to frame some gentle impeachment, and adjust my shirt collar, and re-tie my neckerchief, when an idle-looking vagabond in fustian comes touching his cap to me: “Are you the gent,” quoth he, “that the lady and conveyance waited so long for?”—“Waited! where are they?”— “Gone, two hours ago.” “Gone! and alone?”—“No, a gentleman with her.”—I kicked the villain out of my way, and rushed to the railway station. A train that stops within a mile of her cousin's house had left a minute and a half before, and there would be another in the evening. Hang your trains!—Sought a horse through all the town; not even a donkey to be had. Twelve o'clock!—too late now, even with a horse. Passed an afternoon of deep and remorseful dejection. Came down to her house here, at night, determined to await her return. Kept the old ale plying on the fire of my remorse, and had well nigh quenched it; when, as the clock struck ten, in she came, closely followed by a fellow I have seen hanging about her of late. Smirking, radiant, flushed, she came prancing in; but when she saw me she looked like a thunder-cloud, and her eyes fired into me a volley of black anger. She passed by me, and went up stairs, followed by her gentleman, to some private room, as I suspect. I have not seen her since.—Thus have I again laid the case plainly before myself, and it looks a very bad case—a devilish bad case. How should I do? I wish I had some friend to advise with.—Who comes? He must be somewhat tipsy; he speaks to himself. Why, so do I, yet am I not tipsy. I will hear what he has got to say. (Stands back, and enter Greene, coming from the Inn.) It's he that was with her on Sunday! Greene. A draw-well has a bottom; the deep sea Is not so deep but that it may be sounded. Nothing is bottomless, unless it be A tailor's thimble and a woman's mind. But yet, a tailor's thimble can be seen through; Not so a woman's mind— Wheeler (aside.) He's but a tailor; yet he speaks good sense. Greene. This black-eyed witch— Forgive me, stars! I say this black-eyed queen, So much my own, and yet not all my own, So much revealing, yet withholding that One little word which would elect me king! Have we not stood before a man of God, And taken on our consciences joint vows Anent her cousin's child; thus making me, As 'twere, one of themselves? And did we not On our long Sunday drive unfold our hearts, And lay them side by side, like man and wife, And seem'd they not as one? Yet here to-night I work'd her heart up with most winning speech, Until I thought, Now is my kingdom come, Then put the final question. 'Sblood, it fell Like a man's money overboard at sea, And bought no answer. My bewilder'd ear Heard but a splash, then all was as before! Wheeler (coming forward.) With him that lost the money? Greene. No, my friend, With me. I got no answer; gain'd no point. I put it plainly, “Wilt thou be my wife?” My question, like a pearl into the sea, Dropt, and was no more valued than a stone. Wheeler. Such questions are as common to some women As pearls are to the sea. You should have laid A pearl, or some such trinket, in her hand, Long, long before that perilous question came. Greene. Ah, well, here is this ring—an emerald; With this I did intend to seal her troth— After 'twas plighted. Wheeler. Did she see the ring? Greene. I put it on my finger to that end; She saw it and admired it very much. Wheeler. You know not yet the wooer's A B C. Why, man, she asked you for the ring, and you refused it. Without some guarantee of your sincerity, 'twere mere simplicity in her to yield that point which you complain of losing. I've told her often not to be so foolish. But, for your sake, since you have thus confided in me, I'll make the matter right. I'll scold her into it, and talk father and mother into your favour. Greene. What! are you old Riccard's son? I understood that Margaret had no brother. Wheeler. How could old Riccard have a son and she no brother? Give me the ring. With it I'll recover lost ground, and gain the point that you unwisely missed. Come down to-morrow night. I'll back you out. Greene. Give me your hand, friend—brother. You know who I am, do you? I was with her you know at the christening. Wheeler. Ay, ay, I know. I'll work the thing. Greene. She said herself it would be all right. Wheeler. Come down to-morrow. Good night. Greene. Of course, you'll not tell her what has passed between us. Do it gently; draw it mild, as they say. Wheeler. Ay, ay; good night, good night. [Going. Greene. Well, good night; but here— Wheeler. Yes, yes, I know, I know. [Exit. Greene. Yes, yes, but you don't know.—I've acted unwisely now. I should have seen this sooner. I've loved her chiefly because she was an only child, and old Riccard rich. But now I find she has a brother, anxious, apparently, to get her married and out of the way, that he might talk father and mother, as he calls them, not into my favour, but into his own. Scissors! but this is cloth of another colour. I do not want her. She would not make a suitable partner for one of my disposition, and could only be tolerated on account of that which I erroneously supposed she would inherit. I could not put up with her temper. Some say she is pretty. For my part, I could never see it. Nothing but coarse red and black; cheeks like Newton pippins at a penny a dozen, and eyes like black beetles in the sun. Not my style of beauty, by any means. What a goose I was to give that young dog the ring! I see no way of getting it back without making a fool of myself. What with drink and it together, she has been a dear morsel to me already. But first cost is the least, they say; so I'll let by-gones be by-gones, and have no more to do with her. [Exit. Scene III. The Old Churchyard in the Wood. Reuben and Joseph leaning over the wall. Reuben. Speak not of death and graves. Is't not enough That we should see these mounds and miss our friends, Without the dragging in of painful thoughts That might lie dead as they? We think of death, And lose one-half of life. This holiday Is not enjoyed, to-morrow being none. If I could think I lived through endless time, I could live well each moment of it all: But this my little span is not half-lived, Being lessen'd by the dread it is so short. Stir not the thought of death, and it will lie Still as the dead themselves. Joseph. I doubt it not, Since they do not lie still. It comes unstirr'd. Think'st thou we have the origin of thought Within ourselves? We did not make ourselves. The thoughts that we most purposely avoid Do ever haunt us most. This thought of death At every corner starts out like a ghost Across our path—I doubt not, to the end That we be warn'd and well prepared to join The ever-marching caravan of souls, Across the penal sands that lie between The present world and the next. Reuben. Where is the next? Your lifted eyes look past the winking stars Into the blue delusion. Is it there Your next world lies? Or deep beneath our feet, In the mysterious centre of the earth? Or is it, Joseph, in the brains of priests? Trade, trade—a secret of the trade. Yourself, A cobbler, have a secret—some nice art, That glosses up a thing, and makes it seem More than it is. All trades have—so may priests. Joseph. Faithless, suspicious Reuben! Canst thou doubt That immortality—that rock, that crown— The rock whereon religion builds—the crown For which she lifts her blessed head to God? O call not that a trick of priests' device Which was before priests were. Do not believe A trick could live through eighteen hundred years, And gem the earth with churches—massive fanes On whose high pillar'd walls man graves his soul, And builds it up in reverential stone— Seeking to give his finest thoughts hard form. O do not think delusion or mere trick Could bear all up. Yet do but take away This blessed hope of everlasting life, And farewell to religion! It were nought, And I'd be irreligious as thou art. Reuben. And am I irreligious? So I am. I have no priest, do not confess my sins— To any but myself—go to no church, And have forgotten all my lisping hymns. Yet have I some religion: my poor soul, By the besetting wonder fenced about, Goes prowling round its little park of time To seek an entrance into that dim maze, And gazes with a sad, beseeching eye Up every dreamy vista. All fine thoughts That start up in my way, seek to that maze, And disappear like birds within a wood. I cannot follow them, I lack their wings. And I do think there are beyond that bound A finer beauty, and a deeper truth, Than we on this side know. But what of that? They are not there for me. Therefore I come Back to my own earth, with its vaulted roof, And here find sweet religion. In the night It dazzles, and is called the light of stars. It rises with the moon, and rides all through The rack of windy skies; or when she hangs Heavy and low on a still night like this, It floods the earth with prayer, so creamy soft! And people call it moonlight. All day long It laps the earth in beauty: in the morn It purples up the east, and on the meads It glistens lowly in a daisy's heart. Beneath the trees at noon it comes and goes Like some faint hymn upon a drowsy ear; And some say this is but the hum of bees, Or murmur of the wind among the leaves. Along yon meadowy banks where, like a child All heedless of the hours, the river plays, Religion fills me—ah! I see you smile. But if you knew how much I love these things, And how they move my heart, my lips, to prayer, You would not lightly laugh, but think, with me, There was a spirit in them, which the names We learn to call them by serve but to hide. Joseph. Why, God is in them—any one knows that; But surely not religion. In the church, And in God's book—if thou would'st read that book— Alone is the religion that can save. Reuben. Is not the universe the book of God? And who can read it through? I can but spell As much as tells its Author; and He is A fine besetting wonder to my soul. So this is my religion. More than this I read no reason for—would that I could! I know not what you mean by save; no church, No creed, no book can save this breathing life. My saddest thought is, that our eyes must close On this most beauteous earth, and see no more. Therefore, I seek to shun the thought of death. Joseph. And yet I meet thee in a lonely wood, Beside an old churchyard, pack'd full of death! Reuben. (aside) I wish you had not met me.—Ah, dear love, Thywards leap all the currents of my blood; My heart rocks in suspense, and, like a boat At anchor in a stream, it drags to thee. (To Joseph.) Let us go down to the Bridge and drown these thoughts In Margaret's old October. Joseph. Not to night. You see I'm laden with old boots and shoes. And yet I will. Let's see; I'll take them home And meet you there in less than half an hour. [Exit. Reuben. A whole one if you like.—'Tis ever thus: I nibble at a good thing, like a child That saves the daintiest morsel to the last; And while I spare the luscious bite, some one Comes stumbling up and knocks it from my hand. Or appetite is sated with plain fare, And that which is most toothsome finds no tooth.— The moon walks up the stately hall of night Unto her throne, and all the courtier stars, At her approach fall back and give her way. Tuts! these are but the plain fare of the night, And blunt my appetite.—Ah, sweet, sweet love! [Exit. Scene IV. The inside of the Inn. Margaret and Wheeler in the Bar. Voices from an inner Apartment. Wheeler. He pass'd me when I fell. Some few came round, And he among the rest. I knew his face, As having seen him here; begg'd he would speed To the appointed place, plead my excuse Of sudden accident, and give you this; Which at the christening I did intend To place upon this finger. (Puts the ring on her finger.) Margaret. It is strange! He neither spoke of you nor of the ring. I saw it on his finger here to-night For the first time. Wheeler. Alas! when will ambition Be satisfied with what itself can reach From its own stand of merit? I can see He reached this little beating heart of thine, Standing upon my shoulders. True, he spoke Nothing against me, mention'd not my name: But that suppression put me under foot: My non-appearance was the pedestal Which raised him to thine eyes. But here I stand, Trampling on no one, trusting to that love Which rises to one level in our breasts— Say, shall it float our hearts again together, Billing like two young ducklings in a pond, Beyond the reach of the pecking tribe on the banks? Sweet lips, dear eyes, say yes. Margaret. You had no right To fall at such a time. I am not pleased. Wheeler. It was my too great haste that made me fall; My red-hot, reckless haste to be with thee. My love outran my foot: though it lay lamed, My heart was with thee. Margaret. Is your foot much hurt? Wheeler. At first I could not point it to the ground, No, not for love. Margaret. O, do take care of it. (Knocking, and voices from within.) Voices. Ale, ale! more ale! tobacco! bring the jug! Margaret. I've heard a piece of flannel boiled in salt Was a good thing for a sprain. Wheeler. Ay, so they say; But, bless your heart, it's almost well again. One little kiss—come love—'twere worth a web Of flannel boil'd in salt. Margaret. Behave yourself! I'm very angry with you. No! not one. Do you not hear them calling? Let me go. [Kisses her, and exeunt, she following to the door. Juniper (within, knocking and shouting.) Margaret, Alice, Ann! More ale, some one. Re-enter Margaret, admiring the ring on her finger. Margaret. Have you no patience there? How very neat! How lustry green the stone! and fits so well! Yet, there is something strange in the two tales Of Greene and Wheeler; they do not fit well. (More knocking.) Enter Bradbury from the inner room. Bradbury. What, is there no one here?—Ah! pardon me. (Margaret takes in the ale-jug.) His impudence is not to be endured. He sits and shouts there, “Margaret, bring the jug”— As if she were a common waiting-maid; And asks his friend, “Tom, how do you like our ale?” And bets that he will play a game at bowls On our own green with any man for a sovereign. (Laughing within.) That's he, the swaggering fool!—She comes: ah, sweet! Fill me another glass, I'll drink it here, And thou wilt sit beside me. Margaret. My dear sir, You should not leave the company! Go in And sit amongst them; take your pipe and glass; Be jolly, man! What, company must be humour'd! Let that be your department—this be mine. Bradbury. In proper company keeping, that's my part; But, there's that coxcomb there, he does not know What company keeping is. You would not have A man like me descend to humour him? Margaret. He's but a braggart: heed not what he says, Have I not told you there's no word of truth In all you overhead upon the bridge? Juniper (within) sings. Some say that England's good old ale Went out with days gone by; But do not you believe the tale, And if you ask me, Why? My argument is in my hand— This glass gives it the lie. And some have said that Beauty's face Grows every day more rare; But we have still the antique grace, And if you ask me, Where? My Peggy comes at love's command And you behold it there. Voices (within.) Bravo! bravo! Your health, Juniper! Bradbury. No, no, my dear, I'll not go in again. To-night he has it too much his own way— He and his myrmidons. Content am I That his most certain fall may be postponed. Let him enjoy his visionary bliss While we concoct the real.—Now, dear love, (Takes her hand.) Vouchsafe a word or two. I will not blink Your evident design that I, not you, Should be the mover. I have weighed this well, And, though not customary for the man To make the wife's home his, yet I agree, For reasons touching your weal more than mine. But more of this hereafter. There are things— Preliminary, love, to the event— That claim our prior notice. Pardon me, I wish not to procrastinate the time; But business reasons will not let me name Sooner than this day six weeks— Margaret. What! Six weeks? Bradbury. Well, then, say four. I think I can arrange. Margaret. O, go along; four weeks! the man is mad! Bradbury. What say you then, my pretty one? Let's see— Perhaps I could arrange—O yes, I can: Name any day you please within a fortnight. Margaret. Worse and worse! Why, it would take six months To screw my courage up to name a day, And six to get my dresses made. Young men Are so impatient. O, my dear good sir! It is a serious thing. Be not too rash; Another year or two upon our heads, And then—we'll talk about it. Bradbury. Fiddlesticks! We've talked enough;—but ah! I understand, And much commend thee for thy delicate sense Of the proprieties. The woman's play Is ever to be passive. Thus must she Be looked at, loved, visited and admired, Wooed, flattered, treated and sonneted, Bowed to, kneeled to, solicited, implored; No charm should move her lips to yield consent, Till, like a lamb, she is led without consent; Withholding to the last her sweet “I will,” That she may drop it through the wedding ring. Is it not so, my sweet? Well, well, good night; We understand each other. For a woman The finest gem in all her coronet Is modesty; and Margaret, in thy sphere, Amid the rude attacks and ribald jokes, Still to retain the lustre of that gem, Shows what a crown of studded virtues sits Around these raven tresses! Dear, good night. (Knocking on table within.) [Exit Bradbury followed by Margaret. Juniper (within) sings. There was an old fox, and he lived in a brake, He sneak'd out at night, but avoided the day; In passing one morn e'er the fowls were awake, He entered a henhouse and gobbled away. He pick'd of the hens all the sattest and best, Suck'd the eggs, and got drunk on the blood of the cocks; And when he had feasted he lay down to rest:— But the little cock chicken it swallowed the fox. This little cock chicken, who was he, say you? The greedy old fox was a foolish old man. Then rede me my riddle, come rede me my riddle, O rede me my riddle, lads, rede if you can. Re-enter Margaret, who busies herself wiping glasses. There was an old owl and she lived in a tower; She never came out when the sunshine was bright; But her eyes gleam'd like lamps in the murkiest hour, And she haunted the farm-yards over the night. She pounced on the varmint that crept for the stacks, Groped under the sheds when the weather was foul; And the rats squeak'd out as she pinched their backs; But the little wee mousey it swallow'd the owl. This little wee mousey, who was she, say you? This greedy old owl was a foolish wo-man. Then rede me my riddle, come rede me my riddle, O rede me my riddle, lads, rede if you can. (Knocking on the table inside, and huzzaing.) Enter from the inner room several gents, followed by Juniper. They go off, and he remains. Juniper. Walk slowly, gentlemen, I'll follow you.— Now, darling dear, come, put away the towel: Let Alice do the glasses. Why should you Do all the sloppy work? You should have come And sat beside us. Did you hear my songs? Has Daddy Bradbury left? What an old fool that is! Are all the yokels gone from the other rooms? How quiet 'tis without them! Well, good night. What, not a word to spare? Margaret. O, yes;—good night. Juniper. O, bother to its little saucy lips; I'll make them speak. [Kisses her, and exit. Margaret. How can you be so rude? [Follows him, slapping him with the towel. ACT II. Scene I. The Bar in the Inn. Enter Reuben, looking up at the clock. Reuben. Peggy, your clock is wrong,—and yet this quiet Corroborates the clock! One may almost Discern the hours by anything; our clocks Are needed but for minutes. In this house Each hour has its own sound; for, even now, This silence has a ring that tells the time. The husbandman can note it in the field By the peculiar creaking of his plough; The housewife by the blinking of her fire; And they that live in cities know the stride Of any hour that walks along the streets. Enter Margaret. Margaret. Now, where have you been raking to all night? Perhaps you think I did not see you pass. Pray, keep away your hand. Go chuck her chin With whom you have been walking. Reuben. By this hand, Thou hast thyself been with me all the night; And, like the marble Venus of the wood, Hast stood before me in the dusky shades. I throned thee up in niches of the clouds, To be admired by all night's gazing eyes; And, from my bended knee up to thy throne, My heart would leap to think thee all my own. Margaret. And by such leaps it overleaps the mark. But do not think to cheat me with fine talk Of marble Venuses and hearts that leap Up from a bended knee. Be plain, confess, That with some country lass you've been to-night Hanging about the lanes. Reuben. 'Twould wrong the sun, And prove a man insane, if, in broad day, To pick his steps he used a farthing light. Margaret. I grant the insanity, but not the wrong. The monarch sun smiles at the little act. He is not wrong'd more than his light is paled By that poor farthing blaze; nor yet withholds One ray from him that would insult his light. Reuben. Then be thou like the sun and feel no wrong. Margaret. O, do not think you wrong me: you may flirt With all the country lasses in the place: It makes no odds to me: not it, not it. Reuben. Thy busy brain hath spun both warp and woof, And woven of itself this spider's web; And love is wrestling in it like a fly. Sit down and I will brush it from thy brain, And loose the wingèd prisoner from its snare. Sit down beside me and I'll tell thee all. Margaret. O, keep it to yourself. Pray, why should I Be made to listen to your love affairs? (Sits down beside him.) Impudent gipsies! What care I for them! Reuben. When first I cross'd the bridge to-night, this house Buzzed like a hive with honest country men, Who talk'd, and laugh'd, and sang all in a breath. And thou wert on the move from room to room. But why should I come in to sit and stare, Without this luxury of sweet discourse; To see thee at the beck of everyone, And but a passing word, a smile, a glance, Fall to my share—who would have all of them, Compress'd, distill'd, served up on those red lips, And drink their spirit thus? (Kisses her.) Therefore I pass'd On through the moonstruck lanes, along the heights, And round upon the wood— Margaret. But not alone? Reuben. Not if thy sweet idea be a presence.— On coming by the church, I met— Margaret. So, so! I thought it would come out. Persuade me now It was by chance, mere chance, you met her there.— Now do not come so near me. Pray, keep off. Who was she? But I do not want to know. Reuben. I met a cobbler coming by the church. Reproof sits in thy unbelieving eyes; But if the cobbler come not here to-night, And witness this the truth, then may those eyes Never again receive me in soft folds, But be the hard impenetrable glass That they are now. Margaret. I cannot, for my life, See what can take you into woods alone At these late hours, or any time alone. I have no fellowship with anything That smacks not of humanity; no love For dusky shades, cold skies and mewling streams, Unless they are alive with whisper'd words Or ring with merry laughter; and mute night, That, like a cockatrice with myriad eyes, Sits staring at the earth, I hate and shun, Making it day inside with cheerful lights. Oh, frightful is that silence which redounds The beat of one's own heart! And solitude, In which we breathe the fume of our own thoughts, Is no more pleasant than a smoky house. Your musing, moping, solitary fits Are a disease. Reuben. Of which be thou the cure. There is a dancing spirit in thy veins Which sets my blood on tiptoe. Let my breast To thine lie nearer, love, so that my heart, By sympathy, may time itself to thine. Margaret. O, not through bony ribs can hearts be moved, But through the electric channels of the brain; As, when some sudden news leaps in the ear, The heart is on the instant beating time To the music of that news; or when we read Some stirring tale that gallops to a close, The heart goes with it and obeys the theme. If you would have your heart keep time with mine, Be minded as I am. Reuben. Then, in my ear Drop thou thy heart's best news, or let me read, Within the stirring volume of those eyes, The tale which I could wish might never close; Or hand lock'd into hand, or lip to lip, Or cheek heaved on the soft sea of thy breast; Whichever way thy spirit may embue My languid being with thy richer life! And then, ah then!— Margaret. If you indeed were true— If there were one true bosom amongst men, And that were yours, I'd give myself unto it, Confidingly as does a new built ship Pass from her mother's arms into the sea— Into the bosom of the fondling sea, Who proudly bears away his new-made bride. Reuben. Yes, while in view of home, and all her friends, He gently dallies with this maiden bride: But when he takes her to his desert keep, Far off into the friendless waste of waves, A very Blue Beard does her lord become; And having beaten her, he thrusts her down In some vile dungeon, never to be seen: Or spurns her from him on a foreign shore To languish in neglect. Or if, perchance, He brings her home again, a haggard thing, It is to cast her on her parent's bosom, Then run away and leave her. Faithless sea! Yet, if my breast were true as the false sea, The trim-built Peggy would resign herself Unto it with the surety of a duck That throws itself upon a glassy lake. Margaret. I almost think your eye does not deceive, But may not trust your words. Reuben. Then take the eye. Spirits out of the flesh could not deceive; Their closest thoughts lie bare, and all may read. The guile is in this clothing of the soul, In which the only loop-holes are the eyes. Think'st thou, my sweetest, we shall live and love After this shabby habit is put off? Margaret. Most surely, yea. They tell us who best know. Reuben. Ah, that is why I doubt it; that we need Telling at all—not born into the fact. But do'st thou think, for ever? love for ever! As much as we do now? O, heaven indeed! Our earthly cares laid in an earthly grave, And evermore to feel this luxury Of being with each other—this deep pulse That beats to the extremest edge of joy In both our breasts at once, as from one heart, Whose office is to give out love for blood! Were it not heaven to be always thus, Without the dread of coming separation? Margaret. Such is not heavenly love. The love you paint Is deeply tinged with earth: it is, indeed, Our greatest earthly care, and must go down With all our lesser cares into the grave. This ache o' the heart which we on earth call love, Little befits us for the love in heaven. It is too pure for our sin-spotted souls, Which must be washed in the living blood of Christ, Ere they can take the dye of heaven on. Reuben. But is not earth God's earth? He loves the best, And lives the most, who fills the God-given cup Of present capability to the brim— E'en though he stain it with earth's blood-red wine, Unfitting it for nectar. Change of drink Will have a change of cup. But I want none, Either of cup or drink. From this sweet thee There overflows into my chaliced heart A nectar which the gods themselves might sip, And be the more celestial. Lay thy cheek Here, love, and I will live upon its glow. Hear'st thou the satisfaction of my heart That bears so sweet a burden?—God! to die, And be for ever thus!—Time, cease thy hours, Arrest us in our deepest trance of joy, That we, when thou art run, may so remain Through the eternal day. Margaret. Reuben, my Heart! Let us not go too deep in this god's cup, For fear the dregs prove devil's drink. Reuben. Then, bring Right sovereign ale, for here King Crispin comes.— Politic prince! one who submits his rule All to the understandings of his subjects, Yet, stooping, takes the measure of their foot. Inheriting the ancient virtue, he Heels more than any doctor, cures more soles Than all the curates of them: nor restricts His bounty to their higher wants alone, But sometimes adds to his poor subjects' corn; Yea, bountifully administers his awl, And measures out his mercy to the last. O, worthy king of cobblers! Enter Joseph. Exit Margaret. Joseph. Sweet King Love, That would not talk of death and the old churchyard. I see, I see; nor do I marvel thou Should'st see an Eden in this sinful earth. And, welt me, but this Eve of thine would make A worse place Eden. The forbidden fruit Might ripen in the sunshine of her eyes— Ripen to heavenly sweetness; and the sin Of taking it were such a tempting sin, That angels might transgress and be forgiven. Reuben. What will you have, Joseph? Let us sit down inside. I'll talk to you now about any mortal thing— Aye, or immortal either. When the heart Stands proudly on the top of its desires, No longing unaccomplished, then the mind— Perch'd high above the ambitious mists that creep Out of the marshy troubles of our nature— Sees far and clearly. Come: what shall we have? [They pass into the inner room. Scene II. The Kitchen of the Inn. Mrs. Riccard sitting at a table with tea-things on it. Mrs. Riccard. Come, Margaret, come to supper; get them out: It's time they were gone home.—Well, folks that keep A public-house work harder for their living Than he that breaks stones on the public road. He stops when wearied, has the cheerful run Of all the passers-by, yet none to serve. His day ends with the dusk; his humble cot Is his while in it; and when Night and Sleep Go through the villages from door to door, Gathering to blessed rest, he can obey. And when the morning's level beam walks in Upon his lowly floor, he wakes, as if It were an angel stirring in the house— Wakes gently and refresh'd: then plods to work, Over the beaded grass, with songs of birds, Pelting like raining music in his ears.— Not such our life who must the public serve. Though weary unto death we may not stop; Fresh comers must be served. Our one day ends Just where the next begins—at twelve at night! There is no room in all this roomy house But may be anybody's for three ha'pence— And a glass of ale to the bargain. Any lout May order like a lord; we humbly wait, Screwing our faces to a gracious smile. The cock that crows up all pure-living things, Warns us, like guilty spectres, to our lairs, To restless unregenerate repose; And when we wake we scarce can name the day, Our calendar having run all into one.— But then, it pays, and money mends it all. With us the worst is over: speedy wealth Will give us long retirement. Best of days Are those that fight up through a blustering morn; And having clear'd the rifted clouds by noon, Break out in azure, and go blithely down The long slope of a sunny afternoon.— Come, Margaret—come, my lass, I yawn for sleep; Mine eyes nip and grow rheumy. Get them out— It's little they'll drink now.—There is some wit In knowing when to fill, when not to fill; And there's a knack in getting people out. When drink won't pay for light, it's time to stop.— Now, come—are those two gone? Enter Margaret. Margaret. Gone! bless yo, no. They seem set in for a two hours' sit, at least; and even that won't finish their subject. If I fill them another glass in half an hour, they'll not be half a minute advanced in their argument. It keeps no pace with the clock, and seems, indeed, more fitted for eternity than time. They never meet, these two, but they are at it, as keen as knives and forks at a cheap dinner; but I see in them no corresponding diminution either of appetite or eatables. Their arguments are like splashing in water; they make a great frothy noise; but when that ceases, we find no impression made: the water might never have been touched, barring that it is muddier than they found it. Each seems not so much to listen to what the other says as to what himself says; not so much to consider what the other has said, as what he himself shall say next. Mrs. Riccard. You see they are both already full, each of his own conviction. Though both strive to convince, yet neither will hold any more; and that is why both speak, but neihter listens. I have always seen that gentlemen whose minds are made up and comfortably settled, the moment one begins a-talking to them, they likewise begin. It is like filling bottles that are already full.—But, Margaret, let me tell you this: you allow that Reuben too much his own way. You lay yourself too open to him. Men will push themselves far enough into a woman's affections without facilities given on her part. One in your position should be fenced about with thorns. Margaret. Now, mother, have you not often said that a pretty girl in a public-house—if she be judicious enough—is the making of it? Have you not often hinted to me not to be too abrupt with gentlemen, but to linger rather over the serving of them, and give each of them, in turn, the smiling side of my face, so that he in particular might think he was the favoured one? And have you not often said that a sensible girl might allow great familiarities without any danger—such as a chuck under the chin, an arm thrown about her waist, or even, at times, an attempted kiss? Mrs. Riccard. Yes, through the fence; but the thorns should interfere, and make the intruder draw back. Margaret. Why, so they do. O, I can be throny enough, and sweet enough too—thorns and honeysuckle twined together. I'll warrant you, none shall take the one without feeling the other. Mrs. Riccard. I fear you with none so much as Reuben; and that is the reason of my counsel. For, looking through the lattice here into the bar to-night, I could see him fondling you, and pressing you to his lips, and devouring all your sweet breath, as if you had been a plucked rose that had lost its barbs; and I could see no attempt on your part to cast him off. Now, this is wrong—quite wrong—and very dangerous. Had he been a man of standing among folks;—if he had money, property, or a good business; if he had been a marriageable sort of man, it would have been another thing, I could have said nothing; for, Margaret, you are getting into years, and must not lose your market. But him! Who is he? Nobody! What is he? Nothing! He is not known among respectable folks. Poor, drunken, half-witted creatures reckon a deal of him; but that is a bad sign. He spends all he gets, and has nothing to fall back upon. Like most other of your hangers-on, I daresay he thinks if he could get you he would have nothing to do but hang up his hat —which is all his moveable property—and sit himself down, with all his personal effects. Margaret. A little more sugar in this—I mean a little more tea —yet, wait a little till I taste again. Well, I don't know what it wants. Mrs. Riccard. Why, child, your lips have lost all taste. Margaret. Ay, so it seems—at least your lecturing would make it appear so. Mrs. Riccard. My lecturing! Oh! Well, my lass, you know it's for your own good. If a husband were a thing for gratifying your lips merely, I should not object even to Reuben; but a husband cannot be held as a sweetmeat and no more, he cannot be shut up in a cupboard, a secret to all but yourself. No, the world persists in knowing that you have a husband; and, go where you may, his reputation goes with you, whether he be there or not. A woman rises or sinks to her husband's level—loses her own character and name, and takes on his. She is no longer whom she was, but So-and-so's wife. And as nothing but substance now-a-days can raise people up, we that are up should beware of being dragged down. Above all things, Margaret, shun a poor man. Look at your cousins, they are all respectably married. What would they say—what would the world say—if you were to marry the like of Reuben? Margaret. Why, mother, what makes you talk of marriage in earnest? I thought it was only your usual mirth that was venting itself. You know my reasons well enough for playing with these men-mice. I can crush any of them on the instant when it suits me. Trust me, I know better than you seem to be aware of how far to let them transgress into my favours. As for going the length of marriage! bless your heart! and with Reuben too! a man we should have to keep. Why, to suggest such a thing is equal to suspecting that I am not your daughter. Mrs. Riccard. I am not so much afraid that you go the length of marriage, as that you overstep it and go farther. Margaret. Ah, I see what you mean, but there again you belie your own maternity. Am I not of your own bringing up, mother? I do just as you would do were you as I am, and kept pace with the times. If I seem in your eyes to outrage discretion a little, just reflect how manners are changed since you were young. Mrs. Riccard. Aye, manners are changed, like dress; but when young folks come together, and love gets in between them, the ancient souls and bodies of all our young days are found breaking through both manners and dress. The blood of our first parents runs down all the centuries, and this is seen in nothing so much as in the love between man and woman. I would not have you trust too much to the custom of the times. It is but the froth upon life's stream. Old nature runs strong beneath it, and is ever tumbling up and shouldering aside the giddy bubbles. Your changed manners are not a footing that I could like to venture on. If they are the glittering froth upon the stream, they are also the treacherous ice. People skip gaily enough over it for a time, but a sudden stroke of nature, like a sunbeam, melts it, and they fall through.— (Knocking within.) Give them no more drink, but get them out. [Exit Margaret. I have no fear of her, for she is one That ever keeps upon the windward side Of any one she copes with, let them sail As close as skill can steer them. I have seen Full many a bouncing gallant thrown aback, Quite baffled and wind-shaken in the attempt To take the breezes out of her full sails, And reach a tack beyond her. Yet 'tis well That I at times should bring her to the chart To see how fares her voyage; for to-night I fear she ventured too far off her course, And fell among the pirates. If she still— That time she seem'd so rudely overhaul'd— Made but a feint and overhaul'd the pirate, She outreaches even me. So I'll to bed And dream of old scenes. I have talked myself Back to the time when from my father's door I've gazed whole hours, with my roaming thoughts Quite lost upon the sea. From our bleak coast It stretched far out until it met the sky, And both seem'd rounded with a belt of sleep. Sometimes white sails would dip into my sight, And pass away like beings in a dream; And sometimes, when a rattling breeze was on, And sea and sky, sunshine and flakes of cloud, Were blown about together, troops of ships Would pass our way. Ah! 'twas a gallant sight To see some leap and bound before the gale, And lay their black sides in the hissing wave, Whilst others battled up against the wind, And veer'd and tack'd, and came so near the shore That we could see the features of the crew, And hear them speak,—whiles in strange foreign tongues. And there were fishermen upon our coast— Squat, red-faced men, that smelt of bait and lines, And one old man, with hoar, sea-batter'd face, Came often to our house. Ah me, the tales He told us of the sea! And as he spoke, He roll'd about a huge quid in his cheek, And peer'd around with moist and wandering eyes, As if the dim horizon still he search'd For some expected sail. And in the midst Of the most breathless passages he stopp'd And blash'd the black juice out upon the hearth, Then with his hard palm wiped the wicks o' his mouth, And to his tale. He brimm'd so of the sea, His merest look or motion blabb'd it out; And, like a shell press'd to the listening ear, Though dead he would have sounded of the sea. A weird-like bleakness hung about our coast, And crept a far way inland on the moors— A very wilderness of doleful sounds. And everything was stunted in its growth: The most unearthly trees, all bent one way, Knotty and blasted. When the sea-wind brought The haur and rain, and drove them up the holmes, Our trees seem'd terror-struck: like skinny hags They stood, with rags and loose bewilder'd hair Streaming before them, and long wither'd arms, All pointing to one terror, whilst the wind Beat as 'twould force them on it. And at night Both sea and land were cross'd by wandering lights— In sooth, it was a very old-world place. It comes upon me with a fear-ful love. Enter Margaret. Now make all straight for the night, and get to bed. [Exit Mrs. Riccard. Margaret. And when I get I shall not sleep.—His lips Ran over me like fire; and as he went, I thought he would have parted with his soul In that long, wild, last kiss. I sleep! Oh, all The pulses of my life are twice awake! My heart beats in my brain—yet in my breast— And here, and here—I am all one beating heart!— None loves me more than he, and but for pride I should confess I love none more than him. Well, no one hears me, and I will confess; Our faults are turn'd to virtues by confession. Then to my own ear my own tongue confides The secret of my love. I that have held Love as a weakness, and with mettled nerve Withstood the blast of many forging hearts Unmelted, even unblister'd, while they burn'd Themselves to ashes—when the true heat comes, Have found myself most malleable—so soft That he might mould me into any shape. And would I could be shaped to fit his breast! Ah, Reuben! Reuben! Reuben! that dear name Comes like a wave upon my thirsty soul; And I could keep repeating Reuben, Reuben, Until he came himself, like a high spring-tide, And fill'd the bay of my out-reaching arms. So now I have confess'd: what then? what next? I'll wake to-morrow like a drunken man, And find I have been a fool; and turning to This dish of love—life's cream, so sweet to-night— I'll find it sour and curdled. Day's clear thought Is to the yesternight a glass, from which It often shrinks at sight of its own face, Abash'd as painted beauty when it sees Itself next morning after a late-up ball. Heart rules evening and night—head, morn and day; And heart-love will not bear the head's reflection. Yet, if the world would keep away its head, I could hood-wink my own, and be love-blest With my poor heart's election. But the choice Of husbands, raiment, modes of life, and friends, Belongs all to the world, is no more ours Than choice of parentage, or place of birth. We only think it is. My mother looks On this, my heart's affair, as would the world, And as my after judgment must approve, When this sweet fever passes from my brain; For, like a hot day, love is wrapt in haze; Its beauties are near-sighted. I may trust My mother's eye, which in my picture sees A miserable background. Were he one That boded higher rising, there were time, Good time, for us hereafter. But he sets No count on high estate, and even sneers At my allusion to it. If I lean The least on my position, he lets fall, As if by accident, some lumbering word That knocks away my prop, and makes me feel No better than a milk-maid. He affects Not low but lowly company—poor folks; And, while he seems like one that ought to float Among the better sort, I find he sinks— Like wood that one picks up along the shore— But yet he sinks not lower than my heart; Too low, yet high enough—and there's the plague.— Would that I had no cousins, that there might Be no comparisons 'tween them and me. For though well match'd, I've often jeer'd them both About their plodding husbands, and extoll'd The better marketry they might have made. This curbs my heart's free action. They must feel How proudly I have ridden the high horse; And if I marry Reuben, what a fall!— I'll straightway cease to love him—if I can; And then, what matter though he still love me? I have some thirty in my toils besides, All adding to our custom—and, indeed, It's not my part to drive them from the house.— Yet, after all, to abuse the thing we love, Or even once loved, is a heavy shame That hangs about the bottom of one's heart. And he must ever be that thing to me.— I'll break this love-bond slowly, so that he May never know the breaking. My heart's change Shall cross him like the seasons of the year. The summer of my love will pass, and be Succeeded by another season's joy; Each filling up the voided heart. Thus I Will wear him on to winter ere he know, Then shut myself, like Nature, up in ice, When he of choice will leave the frozen thing.— He comes to-morrow evening to our dance. I'll trip a reel of ‘Cumberland’ with him— It is his favourite—and after that My love-leaves shall begin to droop.—Good night— Another sweet good-night go after thee, My Reuben—this night more I call thee mine. To-night I'll let my dreams loose, and like bees To fields of clover, they will swarm to thee; And having revell'd, Bacchanalian like, On thy rich blooms of love, they will come back Loaded with love to me; and all night through, My brain will hum with dreams—hum like a hive. Scene III. The Bridge. Reuben and Joseph. Reuben. What light is this? It cannot be the dawn! No—see the moon straight up above our heads, Her face bent earnestly down on this spot, As full of wonderment as one that looks, With bright enchanted eyes, into a nest. Joseph. A lark's nest, with two eggs, down in the grass. But do you not see two moons? I see two! And, by the mass, they jostle one another, And try to get into each other's place. Something's to happen—we have seen two moons! Reuben. No—only one; and she is still as Faith. The ale has put your eyeballs out of gear; They do not pull together. Their old bond Of partnership dissolved, each has set up Upon its own account; and thus your brain Sees one moon twice at once, and thinks it twain. Joseph. My brain sees twice the words, and twice the trouble That need be used to say I am seeing double.— Well, drink works great divorcement in a man! His eyes, which God hath join'd; it puts asunder; His tongue becomes a traitor to the state, Of which his head is king; his arms throw down Industrious trades and handicrafts, and rise In idle high rebellion; and his legs Pay swaggering fealty, or quite throw off All manner of allegiance; till at length The lords are driven from their seats i' the brain, And leave no government in all the land. Then rocks the throne, down comes the kingly head, Clod-hopping feet are up, and in his stead. Reuben. I never felt a softer light than this: It lies about the soul like folds of silk. Yet does it seem unearthly. See the road, How lank and pale and like a corpse it lies! How like two ghosts we stand upon the bridge, And, ghost-like, cast no shadow! Joseph. By my brogues, And neither do we! But I seem to stand— Not very like a ghost—on mine own hat! Reuben. The bridge strides like a mammoth skeleton, Its big bones weather-bleach'd ten thousand years.— Joseph. Four thousand years before the world began! Reuben. I think I hear the moaning of the sea!— Though no external sound be in the ear, Yet, if we listen, we can hear a sound Coming from depths within. So when the earth Is speechless, and the air has ceased to breathe, Then in the night's vast ear the sea is heard, Though miles and miles away. I never hear That voice, hoarse-toned and ancient, but I feel The embedded ages pressing on my soul. It comes with all their burdens in its moan; And I am crush'd into the merest grain Of rock that tides build in a million years!— Joseph. Lord, how he adds and multiplies! A man, Thus reckon'd, might be Adam's grandfather. The earth itself but counts six thousand years— Reuben. Crush'd from my place in Time! But living souls Can travel to the very brink of Time And look a stage beyond it; and though lost, There on the marge of the eternal gulf, 'Tis higher life to be sublimely lost Than keep one place in Time, and stop within The little circuit that we think we know.— A thought can crush the soul to nothingness! But if it be the soul that form'd the thought, Is there not hope that it will rise again? Mind's weakness is its strength if when it sinks, It be beneath the weight itself creates. Joseph. I never knew thee worse of drink till now— And this is sober drunkness. Thou hast ta'en Glass after glass with me till I've been blind, Then with another till he could not stand, And with a third till he went mad and raved; Yet who can say he ever saw thee drunk? Reuben. Not you, if you were blind. But what of that? I could be drunk, if I liked, upon one glass, Or sober after fifty. There is none Of all the spirits stronger than the will. Joseph. It must be taken first, then—and unmix'd.— But, come, will you go home with me to-night? I have a butt of prime ale in the house, And we can drink until it's time to rise. Reuben. Some other time I'll taste it—not to-night. The night is past! Look, in the east, the clouds Are shifting like the scenes upon a stage, Preparing for the entrance of a star. How busy all is there! And, see, the hills Have turn'd their shining faces to the east, And throb with expectation. Joseph. High in air The two lights struggle. 'Tis a fight between A golden eagle and a silvery snake, And I know which will conquer. Reuben. So do I: For as the snake's is borrow'd flight, So the moon's is borrow'd light; The sun that lends will conquer. Let us go Before their bright blood shed on us; for soon 'Twill sparkle on the dew-tips of the grass.— Good morning—for the morning is begun. Joseph. Nay, nay, good night—all's night above the sun. [Exit. Reuben. The air this side the keystone is at least A breathing nearer her. It may have play'd About her lips in sleep, and even now Be laden with dream kisses meant for me. I have but parted from her and my heart Hungers and thirsts to be with her again. But certain hours of sleep—at least of bed— And then a drudging day, and tasteless meals, Stretch like a wilderness between the times Of parting and of meeting. Thus, I find That, when far off the object of my joy, I pant in every limb to hunt it down. But when within my grasp, I am content To catch the mere idea of my joy: I fondle it in thought, and would delay The inexorable hour that drives me on.— By this, sleep lies about her like a bath, All warm and breathing round her lovely form; And I so near her yet that, but for walls, I could look in upon her charmèd rest, And watch the dreaming thought upon her lip. But like a pearl within a deep-sea shell She lies with all her beauty to herself, And is unconscious of it. Beauty is lost If no soul drinks it in: and here I parch The while it flows to loss. But as the air Is dower'd with the beauty that earth wastes, So my imagination is enrich'd With that my love is wasting. The sweet air Owes all its sweetness to the abundant earth; And there is not a sweet thought in my brain But comes, my love, from thee. The larks are up, And though the night still lies along the ground, Up yonder it is morning, and their wings Beat out bright gleams of fire. Into yon wood An owl pass'd like the rag-end of a cloud. Things of the night steal one by one away; And I am grown so much a thing of night That I feel scared like them at this pure hour; I feel upbraided by the eye of heaven, And, in the presence of the morning star, Stand like a culprit brought before his judge— So deeply dyed in wrong that to do right Has still the hue of wrong on it: for now, It seems like guilt to undress and go to bed When all pure things are rising, and the birds Have sung the matin-hymn of a new day.— How fearfully distinct the fields have grown, All witnessing against me; while the inn— My drunken friend the inn—stands there asleep, And leaves me all to answer for. Hillo! Nay—'twas myself that started—not the inn. Hillo! hillo! it is dead-drunk asleep. But, whisht! or I shall break diviner rest. Not rudely her sweet slumber would I end; Yet were I by her side, one kiss, just one Should fall like dew upon her rose-bud lip. And if that gently waked her, O, my heart! It were a sight to watch her fringèd eyes Open and close, like sunrise in the clouds— Open and close, whilst consciousness broke out, And grew on her like morning on the earth. It were to see a sweet creation, this— To mark the change from birth to womanhood, Press'd in a little age. First she would look As blank of meaning as a new-born babe, And then her eyes would form on mine, child-like, As when a mother, in a fresh delight, Cries “See, the darling notices!” And then, The rippled smiling of a little girl Would chase itself a-while about her face, As saying “I see one I've seen before;” And then the questioning, half-startled gaze Of riper maidenhood would rise, and burst Into the woman's comprehending glance,— Ah, then, the mantling blush, the hiding shame To find me there, close to her naked bed! It were, indeed, a pantomime of love— And I should play the fool—so there's an end. [Exit. ACT III. Scene I. Reuben's parlour. Jane sitting at the breakfast table. Jane. Already comes the morning sun across To lick the shadows from our side the street, And noisy children shift their playing ground To bask like flies i' the heat. Outside, the day Is thoroughly awake—indeed half done, While here, inside, it seems not yet begun. (Rings bell.) The greater part of life is spent in waiting To do that which the other never does. My appetite is sated through the eyes, Waiting for Reuben, who leaves his in bed; Or if he bring it with him, his affairs Step in 'tween it and the meal. Breakfast with him Is but the flourish of the instruments Before a piece of music left unplay'd. Enter Mary. Go, knock at my brother's bedroom door; if up Tell him that breakfast waits; if still abed, Give double knocks, and shake him from his dreams; Give him no chance to fall asleep again; Tell him he sleeps enough for all of us, And tell him I'm very angry. Mary. Please, Miss, he's only been two or three hours in bed, Miss; and he does not sleep such a terrible deal, Miss; his key never comes to the door, not much before I get up, and good broad daylight, too, Miss, and the sun shining; and boots just awful to clean, Miss, and ? Jane. Well, do as I bid you. Mary. He pass'd me in the lobby just as I went to let in the sweeps, and they kept bawling in the chimney a full hour at least, Miss; and no wonder he doesn't get up; and, I'm sure, if you was me—that is, if I was you ? Jane. Now, now; that's enough. [Exit Mary. He ever was a wanderer of the night, Yet seldom past night's noon. When he returned We saw he had not been in vicious ways; He came as from a bath of meditation, Its freshness still about him; in his eyes A mild light, got with looking in the moon, And all his nature dimpling as a spring Of sweet good humour, mellow as rich cream. So am I not untroubled by the change That, like a sudden rack on a fleet wind, Has over-run his life, and hung a cloud Between him and this little world of home. I feel not now the warm beams of his heart; His presence lacks the soul; in through his eyes I see no moving tenant, but the mould And desolation of a haunted house. His outward garniture bespeaks a lover; But worthy love within illumes a ruin— Gives it the semblance of a lighted fane; He loves unworthily, if he love at all. I've used my artfullest wiles to incline his heart Towards my friend Eliza, my best friend; 'Tween whom and me needs but a brother's love To make us more than sisters. But in vain. He cannot see how dotingly her soul Pours out its wealth on him; nor can he see How much her virtues even exceed the bound Of my great estimate. With such a one, How prosperous were the matrimonial voyage, So often jarr'd by storms. Enter Reuben. Reuben. My breakfast, Jane. You should have waked me sooner. Sleep's a vice Confoundedly tenacious of its hold. Like all the little vices, it will claim That as its due to-morrow which to-day We give by way of favour. Jane. True enough; But hunger'd creatures are not to be blamed For over-feeding when they get the chance. You bedded late last night. Reuben. Yes, pretty late. How over-hot this coffee is for haste! Jane. I did not hear you coming in last night. At what time came you, did you say? Reuben. Past twelve. You should have had it pour'd ere I came down. Jane. I'll bring it cold enough, [Exit Jane. Reuben. Past twelve! and yet, 'Twas but a quarter—of a day—past twelve.— I trust they hanged him that invented clocks. Not only do they lie among themselves,— They are the most prolific cause of lies, Quibble, and deceit, in us who would be true. Had not the steeples with their babbling tongues Rung all the morning hours into my ear, I had been ignorant, and could not lie. It were a virtuous world without a clock! Yet virtue come of ignorance never raised A soul one step to heaven: therefore, those things That prompt us to our sins and teach the way, Are ministers of virtue and of heaven.— I never can escape that infinite circle. In argument I reach the self-same point, Whichever way I turn; and thus I find I never can become a partizan. [Rises to go. Re-enter Jane. Jane. Now, try a cup of this. What, done already! You've taken nothing! Do begin again. Reuben. Thank you, I've eaten heartily, very heartily; So heartily, indeed, my heart is full. Jane. I'd rather that your stomach were. But stay, I want to speak to you. This afternoon I go to spend the evening with Eliza, Who accuses us that we do not return Her frequent visits hither. I will go Early, and take my needlework, and you Will come and fetch me home. Reuben. Well, but—I have— That is—at least—I—you—and then—you see— But yet, it may keep fair—it may, it may. Jane. Keep fair! look out—there's not a flake in the sky! But what although it come a glittering shower! There's many a sheltering tree along the way. Nothing so pretty as the summer rain, Shooting like silver arrows from the sun, Darting and pattering on the leafy shield Above one's head. How pleasant when it fairs, To step again into the beamy day, Along the reeking hedgerows, while the thorns Wink with their little eye-drops! And how sweet To hear the bees resume their droning song, The woods, the bushes, the blue sky itself Break out in bells of music, as the cloud That brought the shower lifts up its skirts and limps Northward beneath the bright and shiny bow That spans the valley. If you think 'twill rain I cannot choose but go. Say, then, you'll come. Reuben. Of course; but then, you'll stay so late; and then,— But yet, I'll come—if I can find the way. Perhaps I'll find it. Jane. If you would, you will. You cross the river by the wooden bridge— You know the way right well!—then straight along The ruin'd tram-road where the rank grass whistles Over the broken rails, and toad-stools gaze, With blind eyes, from the sides of rotten planks, And nettles, thistles, hemlock and dischilaig, 'Mong wrecks of waggons and overturn'd wheels, Infect the mind with sadness— Reuben. Ah, you mean The broken bridge that crosses the canal Near to its head or end. It is indeed The melancholiest picture of decay, In midst of thriving traffic, I have seen! The sodden punts lie swamp'd up to the lips; The green sink is long dead, and yet alive, With reptile and with vegetable life; It bocks and bubbles, and anon a toad Raises a black snout through the slimy scum, Startles the dead dogs with a horrid croak, Then back to slime and silence. Round the marge The long rank grass and fat unwholesome docks Harbour the water-rat and bloated worm; And all around, fragments of strange machines, Invented and then left to rust and rot. Jane. You know very well that's not the way I mean, But quite the opposite. When you have cross'd The river—not canal—and gone along The little ancient railway till you come To the second lane on the right, you turn down that, Pass an old lime-kiln and a white-wash'd house, And on and on, leaving, upon your left, An old house with three gables, and a date Carved quaintly on the lintel of the door; Then onward, crossing by a one-arch'd bridge A sluggish little stream; and then your road Winds round a small wood, deafen'd with noisy rooks. There, in a bed of roses and sweet briars, You come upon a cottage roof'd with straw. You'll know it by the taste—indeed, sweet thoughts It breathes around it; by the little green, And by the antique dial 'fore the door, The honeysuckle tangling to the eaves, The narrow casements curiously set With stain'd glass like a chapel. That is it. Reuben. Ah—bridge—white-house and tram-road—right and left; And then the old lime-kiln on the one-arch'd bridge; Then the house with the seven gables. Let me see— You'll leave Eliza's, say at half-past six; I'll meet you at the seven-gabled house. Till then— [Going. Jane. (following) Nay, stop; why that's the loneliest part, The very dreariest bit of all the road! I'll stay until you come, however late. [Exeunt. Scene II. A room in Eliza's Cottage. Enter Eliza, opening letters. Eliza. From Edward, and it comes to say farewell! I scarce dare open it, for every line I know is writ in tears—tears which a word Had dried up in their cells ere they were shed, That word had I but spoken. (Reads.) “Thanks to the tides, or to the moon who sways them, I shall see you once again before I sail. It will be the day after to-morrow before we can float. O, Eliza! bethink you seriously of our last interview. You sent me away with my soul toss'd on a sea of uncertainty. Heaven sends me one opportunity more. Be prepared to decide my fate for ever. On you it depends, whether I return in two short years, prosperous and happy, or find a home—perchance a grave—on some barbarous shore. My soul knows but one haven of refuge, and that is your breast. Let me depart in the divine trust that to it I may freely return. To-morrow evening I will be with you. Edward.” I would the moon— That most capricious mistress of the tides— Had been more constant, or the calendar That registers her vows, been more precise. 'Tis but to lacerate a closing wound, Meeting so soon again, merely to part: Though, if my heart were not constrain'd to love Another more than him, I'd welcome him To thrice as many meetings. For, in sooth, I know not why he should not be sole lord Of all my future hopes, but for this thing That riots in my heart—this other love. God speaks with many voices, and we dare Not violate his word, and hope to thrive. Conscience oft counsels us to seeming ruin: Be counsell'd—and behold how great the gain! So love, though blindly follow'd, leads to bliss Beyond our poor conception. This my faith, As well as the sweet luxury it is To love the other, even in dearth of hope, Controls me, Edward, and decides thy fate.— But that need not be fatal! The blue sea Soon cures a green love-sickness; and black eyes, Down in the South, soon burn our Nor'land blue Out of men's thoughts.—Now, what says Jane? I wonder. “Dearest Eliza,—You often tell me that I owe you twenty visits. Well, this very day I will pay the half of them with one long one. I shall be with you early in the afternoon, and stay until Reuben comes for me. This is to apprise you of my coming, that you may not otherwise dispose of yourself. Meantime, I am, affectionately yours, Jane.” How like the embodiment of a dream this is! I half mistrust my eyes! And yet they read Reuben in good black ink, in Jane's plain hand. If this be verity, and Reuben comes, I'll think that all my withering hopes have been The falling blossoms, heralding the fruit. My love of him has fed on hopes alone— Hopes sown within my heart, not by himself, But by his sister; and this fertile soil, Together with the rain of many tears, The sunshine of his presence when I went On friendly visits, and the dewy winds Sighing from my own breast, has given my love Unseemly growth perhaps, since he has been But passive in his husbandry—the cause, But not the causer. Yet where'er it grows In wild uncultured strength, the flower asserts Its birthright by the fact that it has grown. So may it be with love. And I have seen That love and wild-flowers droop, and often die, When nicely train'd by man. Ah, if thou lov'st The wild-flowers, Reuben, where they bloom unask'd, In sunny hedgerows or in quiet woods, In dingles deep and dusk, or where they dance In meadows green, and lave in meadow streams, Come here to-night—here grows the wild-flower love. [Exit. Scene III. A street. Enter two gentlemen. First Gent. Yes, we have many instances of love As sudden as the shooting of a star— Second Gent. Coming to nothing, like a shooting star. First Gent. Not so.—I grant, some finer looking men, And many richer, may have fill'd her gaze; But love stands not on looks,—a lip, a nose, Although of import in the general mind, Is little thought of when love makes a choice. They tell us that in heaven all are fair: So love with angel-eyes looks through the flesh, And sees the heavenly features even here. Then, as to wealth, with her of whom I speak, That cannot be an object; for, in short, The old man's rich, and she an only child. Second Gent. I cannot think such progress could be made In one short interview. First Gent. Yourself shall judge. To-night they give a treat to some few friends— Their customers. She said I must be there, And if you'll meet me here at half-past eight, Ill take you with me. Second Gent. No, I'll meet you there: The Bar is public, I presume. First Gent. Agreed. [Exit. Second Gent. What folly to conclude upon a glance— Yea, but a twinkle of that fine black eye, Which she perforce must give to all that come, Or not be there at all! That he must love Is only the necessity of all Who see her. But that she dotes in return Is equally their folly to suppose.— He'll take me with him! Take! How strange to me, Who was, of course, the first that she invited! He's but a stranger to the house. He'll blush For these his soft revealments when he sees Me paramount to-night! And, strange to say! This is the very friend I thought to make Groom at our wedding. Had I but prevail'd Last night on Margaret to name the day, I should have broach'd the subject even now, And quench'd his passion ere it burnt his heart.— 'Tis better as it is. I have observ'd That what we've said is oftener regretted Than what we should have said but have omitted. [Exit. Scene IV. —A Street. Bradbury outside, surveying his shop window. Bradbury. Methinks I have displayed unusual taste, A readier art and quicker expedition, In hanging out my bannerets to-day: My hands seem quicken'd with a conqueror's heart, And everything I touch slips bravely through them. As schoolboys at the approach of holidays, So I, who am almost on the happy eve Of still diviner days, address myself As lightly to my task as if 'twere none. The theory is, we summon up the nerve Of all our coming idleness, and do With force of many hours, the work of one. (Draws from his pocket a note, and reads.) “Supper at nine,” she says, “and then a dance.” A dance! 'Tis awkward, very! Had it been A mental thing!—It matters not, but thus To shuffle all one's self-respect away— Excuse me, love, I have not learnt the way.— But let me catch her deeper sense: it needs Profounder study, larger grasp of mind, In him that truly reads than him that wrote; For he must grasp subject and writer both, And see their wants ere he see all they mean. With fine naiveté and pertinence she writes, “Fools we shall have in plenty; but I trust “That Bradbury will bear with all.” Just so; And her unwritten thought is clearly this: That she expects I will not join this troop Of light feet and light heads, but keep aloof, And with a patron-majesty look on: Yes, sit sedately by the old man's side And smoke a quiet pipe, drop shrewd remarks, And look approvingly—well pleased to see Such innocent enjoyment, yet withal Bearing myself as in a higher sphere.— “Make no advances to me; you will learn “Reasons for this ere long.” I see them now— Yes, thanks to this, (Tapping his forehead) I circumscribe them now.— Thus she concludes: “No more”—Ha! ha!—“no more “Of fortnights or six weeks!”—Well, well, my flower, Bloom yet a little longer; I can wait, So long's none else may wear thee in his coat.— There comes that popinjay—I'll stare him out. Enter Juniper and Friend. Juniper. Good morrow, daddy. Got your window dress'd? Fine display. Splendid shawl that! Gaudy, though! Coming down to-night, eh? Dance, you know. Good morning, daddy [Exeunt. Bradbury. “Fools we shall have in plenty.” Verily, Of all the fools she mentions, he is king! An empty-headed pack! I scorn them all. Of such, however, we, the shrewd, the 'cute, Our profits make, in every branch of trade. They are the life-blood of the taverns, And therefore I will teach myself to bear, To “bear with all,” for Margaret and the house. [Exit. Scene V. Corner of the Market-place. Car, selling vegetables. Car. Not twelve o'clock yet! I wish it was neet! Can onybody tell me if that clock bees stonin'? It doesn't look to me to move a bit! Yet it did tak' a stert when I look'd a while the other way.—Supposing it was twelve now, how long would that be while eight? Add twelve from eight. No, substract twelve to eight. You cannot. Put down your ought and then reduct. Why, it's more till a whole day put together; which is some error.—Howsomever, I must goa to the Brig at eight. Merget said nine; but it's best to be in time. (Enter a woman, who looks at the vegetables.) Two-pence a stone missus. (Woman goes away.) Verra weel; yo needn't buy them. It's dirt cheap for turmits.—I doant need to lower my price now for no woman. I want to leave the merket with a good character; so that hucksters will say, “He was a rare good chap was Richard for keepin' up prices.” “Prices has never been what they was since Richard wed Merget and went to the Brig.” “It was a ill day for aur trade when Richard sterted landlord.” “But a man has a reet to better hissel', and here's wishin' his verra good health.”—Yonder comes Wheeler, one o' them town swells that would like to catch Merget. But hoo wouldn't have a town's mon on no account. Town's folk is actiwally not worth a leek, and quite as green. Enter Wheeler. Wheeler. (aside) There's Car the gardener. I met him on the road half drunk last night, shouting to everyone that passed, “My name is Richard Car, or Dick, if you will. I'll be wed to Merget Riccard in a week, and never sell a turmit nor a green thing no more.”—Good morning, Richard. I hear you are going to be married and turn landlord. Car. What, down at the Brig? Nay, nay, Measter Wheeler, Merget would never take the like o' me. You've the best chance yonder. Wheeler. I once thought so, Richard. She's an excellent wench, and a pretty. But she wants a man that knows gardening and farming; and that's just the reason she's taking you in preference to me. Car. Hoo always said hoo would have nowt but a country mon. But I howp yo'll take no offence, Measter Wheeler. It's not my fault yo knoan. Yo'll not leave the house will yo? Wheeler. Leave the house! Hang it, no! I'll take my glass as usual. Why, man, although I know you and she will be man and wife in a week, yet shall I be down to-night, and perhaps dance a quadrille with her, if you'll let me. Car. You'll be vastly welcome, Measter Wheeler; for I'm nowt at cowreels mysel'. I've been too much at cow heels for that,—ha, ha, ha! Wheeler. You've that to thank for your good fortune, Richard. (Thanks to the tailor's ring, I can afford to joke on this subject.) Good morning, Richard. [Exit. Car. Good day, Measter Wheeler.—He's a verra nice gentlemany gentleman that.—I must go, though; for there will be nowt more done to-day.—Merget's been telling him all about it, I can see; and he taks it weel—verra weel. I thowt he would be vext, but he wasn't; for he sees it isn't my fault. (Loads his barrow, preparing to leave the market, and sings.) Sweet William said to the milkwhite rose, If you will but be mine, O, The pansies shall be your wedding clothes, And our bed the camavine, O. We'll lie in the sun the live-long day, And the merry birds shall sing, O, The bees on their drowsy pipes shall play, And the bonnie blue bells shall ring, O. It's ring, ring, ring, and it's ding, ding, ding, The bonnie blue bells shall ring, O. The milkwhite rose to Sweet William said, What's troth, if it be not true, O? I've plighted mine to the rose so red, And I may not marry you, O. Sweet William hung his head and wept, The merry birds ceased their song, O, The bees into mossy silence crept, And the bonnie blue bells beat dong, O. Dong! dong! dong! dong! dong! The bonnie blue bells beat dong, O! It's a very lamancholy sweet song; and if I could bethink me of the rest of it, I would sing it over all day; for I'll be like to give it them at neet. So I'll goa and bethink me. [Exit. Re-enter Wheeler, with Greene. Greene. —because, if you have not given it her I would rather ? Wheeler. But I have given it her. Greene. I would rather ? Wheeler. But I tell you I have given it her. Greene. Are you quite certain of that? Wheeler. How could I be uncertain? Greene. And how did she take it? Wheeler. O, not with the tongs—gingerly. Greene. I mean, how did she look? What did she say or think? In short, how did the thing take? Wheeler. Well, she looked as if she had been newly shaken out of a bag; and when she came to herself, she said it was a sweet pretty thing, kissed it, and put it on her finger. What she thought, I could not swear to, but I flatter me she wished such brotherly love might continue. In short, the thing took just as I expected it would; and of this you shall shortly be convinced. So, go on and prosper, my boy. (Slapping him on the shoulder.) Good-day. [Exit. Greene. It might be well to prosecute this thing, and not tamely give it up, as I had determined. My battle, it would seem, is half fought by this ally of mine, her brother. And the prize! Why, it may not be so bad after all. She's extremely pretty, and I love her distractedly —with the single exception that she has this brother. But the old fellow's rich, and even the half would not be bad. Then, there's the business: Margaret is sole manager now, and must inevitably inherit it; for that rattletrap could not settle to it. Besides, I will encourage him to drink, and we all know the up-shot of that. Yes, yes, my course seems perfectly clear. But I'll first make the necessary inquiries as to the will, &amp;c. Oh, yes, I'll be cautious not to commit myself. They shan't have an action out of me. [Exit. ACT IV. Scene I. —A Country Road. Enter Reuben. Reuben. I'd give the world, were it mine, for a knottier brain, Gnarly and oaken, which, despite the winds, Keeps its own bent. This willow-twig of mine Needs but a breath to warp it. True, it seems Stalwart, and many take it for a staff; But being inwardly mere rind, it goes All with the pressure, and becomes no staff. My acts are not my offspring, but the bastards Of circumstance and accident. Our wills Should be the parents of our yeas and nays; But mine, alas! is barren and adopts The wandering yea or nay of any one.— I would decide between two ways to act, And fish around me for the merest fin To move me on towards either; or I keep Deciding till belating Time decides. Thus far—halfway at least—I've come, and yet, Whether to go or not remains my doubt. My arguments, like corncrakes, lead me on, Croaking conclusions at my very feet; But when I think I have them, they are gone. My mind's a tangled field through which they run, Defying clear perception. I can see Only those arguments that come like larks, Clear throated from above me. Anything Were potenter than reasons from within. Some stale acquaintance, passing either way, Would take me with him, or a threaten'd rain End all my indecision. But the road Shows not a foot, is sacred to young linnets, Hopping across it, light as breezy leaves: The sky is spotless, and the afternoon Glides like a molten river to the west. Well, I will go to please kind sister Jane: Yet will I not—she has designs on me. She woos for me, makes love on my behalf, And would transfer the progress she has made. Thanks, gentle sister!—but the heart must grow Its own flower love, and mine's already blown.— The harmonies of love surpass all thought, As do those tints that hold the gazer's eye Enamour'd in the bosom of a rose. We only know they are—wherefore and how, No one shall ever know. I cannot love A thing for its perfections: some sweet fault May better fill my imperfectness of soul: And though Eliza's virtues rise like day Over the black and starry Margaret, These eyes are so enheaven'd with my night, They cannot look on day. My gorgeous night! My Margaret with the planetary eyes That rule my heaven of love! I have no heart, No, not an inch, for any one but thee. I'll go a little farther; some kind fate May either send me back, or lead me on. [Exit. Scene II. The Garden and Grounds about Eliza's Cottage. Enter Eliza and Jane. Eliza. The shadows lengthen, and the afternoon Already puts an evening sadness on; And so should I, Jane, had you not been here. Jane. Your senses dream all inwardly: awake! Look with me, and behold how glad we are. There's not a branch but has its little throat Loading the air with melody; light winds Steal through the garden, kissing the pretty flowers— How sweet their breath is as they trip away! That brook that prattles at the foot o' the green, O list how glad it is! And do you hear The oaten rustle of yon full-eared fields— Suggesting harvest-homes? Eliza. I hear and see Their bodies, but their spirits, where are they? They come to you, being in harmony; I lean my ear upon the throbbing air, And hear my own heart—not the spirit tongues That drop their music into ears attuned. We know not what we lose, being unprepared. Seers and hearers tell most dream-like things; Yet who shall misbelieve them and be sure That he is not the dreamer? Jane. It is true. Our faculties, not nature, limit us; And every new development doth find Its object hath been waiting. But I know You did but speak the momentary mood When you bewailed the want of harmony: For we have ever with a similar eye Beheld the self-same beauty in a flower; Our ears have caught the same particular notes That many hear not on the wafting air; And evermore our lips would speak the thought That had arisen in the other's mind. Therefore I think some passing cloud or mist, Or it may be the gathering of love, Has come between you and the souls of things. Eliza. Love comes not like a mist, nor does it throw The shadow of an interposing cloud; But rather, like a new created orb, Adds lustre to our firmament—a sun That wakes us out of night and gives new day— In whose revealing light all dusky things Assume their brightest meanings. Jane. But the sun Doth ever rise in cloud or haze; if, then, Love be the orb that rules our day of life, It, like the sun, may have a misty rise. Love sits on the horizon of thy day, And looks with moist eyes o'er the dew. But see! Thy heaven is blue above; when love stands there, Eliza will be bright again. Eliza. Till then, Indulge me in a little cloudy grief. In sooth, when I look backward through the past, My days of sadness show a brighter gleam, Reflect a deeper warmth upon my heart, Raise more desire to live them o'er again, Than hours of keenest joy. Joy in itself Is but the annual bloom that dies as soon As it unfolds its beauty to the eye: It has no resurrection. Present grief, Though ugly in itself, becomes the root Of a perennial beauty. We have stray'd, Unconsciously, into my favourite grove. 'Tis one of Nature's temples, built of elms. This little path, amid the grass, that leads Nowhere, but still returns upon itself, These feet have worn, for none comes here but me.— Would'st know the service of my leafy church? Jane. Ay. Be it e'er so simple, e'er so rude, I doubt not even Heaven will lend an ear. Eliza. Three times a-day, at morn and noon and even, Do sweet religious bells call me to prayer. First, at the gray and earliest wink of dawn, The mellow-throated blackbirds of this brake, Send soft devotional peals along my sleep; And when I waken into real thought, 'Tis not like tearing from a blessed dream, But a continuation of the dream, For still the soft peals come. Then I arise, And, stepping forth into the morn, behold The sun at orisons upon a bank Far in the east, and with his lowly beams Clasping the whole earth to his loving breast. The grass, the hedges, yea the rankest weeds So dazzle with the sapphire dew, that earth Seems all a paradise, whose very dust Is pearls and precious stones.—The dimpling well That laves the entrance to this hallow'd grove Receives my first obeisance. There I drink. Pure water is the symbol of pure life: The morning draught should be a daily pledge; And inasmuch as 'tis the God-given wine That comes direct from Nature, so we reach The immediate Presence, even by that thought. It is the ruling feature of all things, And that which makes each kin to all, that we, By passing into them, still come to God. What can we more beyond the Eternal Thought, Which in itself is sermon, hymn, and prayer— The sole heart of my service? So I pace This quiet sward to find it; and when found, It is the inauguration of a day On which all things go heavenward: the birds Sing hymns, the flowers in sweet odours pray; The herd boy's whistle, and the mower's song, With sound of sharpening scythes, seem all to ring Of innocence and Eden.—I return To household duties, to a simple meal, And find the consecration on them all. Jane. And this your matin service! But I see It's all thought service. You should give, I think, At least one voiced hymn to the morning; thus:— O morning with thy star divinely fair— Thy hope before thee in the east ascending, Come to our cushion'd earth, God's footstool, where Immortal hearts are bending. We have high hope as thou for brighter day— The hope in heaven, the action still aspiring: We are, like thee, beclouded on our way; But not, like thee, untiring. Teach us thy steady and unwearied way To higher excellence; thy regularity; Thy patient strength throughout the adverse day; Thy universal charity. Give us thy young heart, never to feel old, Though years pass from us and have no returning; Since out of death, our night, we shall unfold, And rise like thee, bright morning! Eliza. The thoughts are good, and wonderfully sung, Considering how untunable the measure.— I would augment my service with a hymn, And have a heart for music; but my ear Is spoil'd, I think, with living near a wood. Therefore I'll leave that part to you. Jane. Describe Your noontide service then; and if a hymn Arise by nature from it, I shall sing. All song should seem spontaneous, if 'tis not. Eliza. At noon there is a brief bar of the day, In which all Nature, even Time, doth rest. Few know of that, for in this rushing world, Many divinities of daily presence Are passed unseen. It is the merest span— Yea, to the onward harmony of time, 'Tis as the rest in music. Yet, thus brief, It is, of all the day, the very break For heavenly thought and pray'r. A little while Before the dial points to noon, I seek The bank beneath yon leaf-beclouded elm, Amid whose branches is a little world Of green and gold and flickering beams, and bees Whose tiny pipes keep up a honey'd drone, Awaking thoughts of fairy-land. And there, On that imaginative bank, I watch The climbing day, the pant of Nature. Soon, The larks drop singing from the clouds, and quench Midway their song, as falling stars their light; The little drones up in the slumbrous tree Sing smotheringly and cease; the lisping brooks Grow deeper throated, hum a quiet bass; The sunny winds lie down outside the woods. Anon, the Day takes his last upward step, And, on the golden pinnacle of noon, Stands still to breathe one breath, before he turns With meek brow down upon the western vale. That breathing was the time—a pause too brief For anything but thought, for thought enough To reach the inner sanctities of heaven, To reach them and return on wings of pray'r.— The day moves on again. Ere you can note The start, each little cloud has broken out In lark notes, and rains music. In the woods The winds have entered on their gleaming wings, And leaves are in a flutter of delight; My canopy, the tree, is in full blast, Its hives of bees have tuned their honey'd pipes. So Nature's organ, with its myriad stops, Plays me from church, dower'd with a glimpse of heaven. Jane. Somewhat indefinite service, is it not? Eliza. I do not know; but if it be, 'tis well— You have the greater license for the hymn. Jane. When Natures rests at noon and seems To tarry on the endless path, 'Tis not the faintness of her beams, The love of ease, the rest of sloth. For oft it takes no stronger will, No deeper life to do than be; So is that quiet Nature still The all of good and fair we see. The ocean deeps drink in more heaven, At peace within their molten calm, Than when on high and tempest-riven, They shout their grand impassion'd psalm. Nor is that calm a stagnant ease; The tides hold on to ebb and flow, And thoughts are passing in the seas, Which only God may truly know. When hearts have cast up sin by sin, And know the tranquil joy of rest, There will be peace as deep within The fathoms of the human breast. Spare me your comments and proceed to eve. Eliza. When day is burning out, there in the west, And leaving but its embers, red and black; When gloaming loans ring with the throstle's pipe, And sing the day's good-evening to the night; When daisies sleep and blue-bells do not ring, Labour at rest and lovers whispering, I to my bosky temple come again.— It is the hour of falling dews; the soul Has its own dew of thought, and then it comes Divinely from the stars: that bright lone one, Venus, amid whose beams Love loves to stray, On whose excess of beauty poets thrive; And all the unnumber'd lesser beads of light That break out on Night's Ethiop brow like sweat, As up the dark he labours; and the moon, That beauteous lunatic who dotes on Night, Hangs on his skirt, lies in his breast, falls out, Then turns her back and leaves him, till some days Of cloud and weeping bring her back again: Yea, all that walk the eternal rounds of space, On what God's-errand we shall never know: Yet while their unknown message speeds, or hearts Live on their waste, the dewy light they spill. My evening service has a starry cast— A glare of moonshine in it, you will say, And vacancy of space: but save that star, The Conscience, whose fine light the fumes of hell May dim, but not put out, which pure hearts know To be the very life of God in us, I know of nought that leads so straight to God As those fine wonders which the skies beget.— To think of space, to know it has no bound, Nor could have, needs a mind like space itself, Eterne, with but illusionary bounds. The mind once born to illimitable thoughts, Must live them through illimitable time. They could not enter in a mind that ends.— O wilderness of silence that lies out Beyond the glimmer of the farthest star, Or in whose unimaginable deeps There is no end of stars! our wings of thought Not long sustain their flight through thee, but flag As thy horizon ever more recedes; They fail, and we, the living souls of thought, Should fall like plummets from the spheres of flight; But the divine necessity of God Is round us, and receives us, and we find Answer and rest more blessed than we sought. In all my services a thought of God Is still my full amen: I can no more. In very truth we need no more: for that, Breathing the soul of everything, supplies The very soul of all our life's deep wants. Parent of heaven and earth and moving things! By whatsoever name with us, or none; However dimly reach'd, whom yet we know To be the soul of life, the heart of love, The essence of all beauty, and the power Whereby the planets roll and dewdrops fall,— O grant that we may know Thee more and more, Not as the past and future God, but now And here, on plain unconsecrated ground! We grandly see Thee in the unfrequent storm That rends the woods and cracks the quarried rocks! O may we know Thee in the simplest air That gathers odours on the thymy banks, And cheaply brings them any summer day! We meekly say the thunder is Thy voice; And e'en philosophy, 'mid causes lost, At last takes up the thought. So may we know That voice as Thine which in our wilful hearts Whispers the simple truth, the honest right. Then knowing it is Thine, may it command Our ready act, however dim the end Jane. Amen. The conscience is indeed God's voice; It cannot be out-reason'd; therefore 'tis The reflex of a higher mind than ours. As well earth burn the sun out with her fires, As we by argument put out this light. Eliza. See! Evening, with the eyelids almost closed, Looks through their long dusk lashes, half in dream, And passes softly into deeper sleep. Sing us a hymn and then we'll go along. Jane. Day pass'd from earth, and sky and cloud Laid him in a golden shroud: Tears, sad but beautiful, were lying On the earth when Day was dying. When our course is run, O may You and I be like the Day— Not die but with accomplish'd duty, And pass amid increase of beauty: Then, when lost to mortal sight— Lost in blank imagin'd night, Our places vacant, friends repining, We, like Day, elsewhere be shining. [Exeunt. Enter Reuben. Reuben. This comes of gallantry—a wild-goose chase! “The willing horse is always ridden blind.” Be you but half disposed to attend a woman, She'll keep you trotting; be you whole disposed, And there's an end to all your own affairs. What hindered her from coming home herself? O, no; they can do nothing of themselves. Madam, your leave to help you o'er—a straw! Allow me, miss, to lift you o'er the stile! Tuts, put a husband on the other side, The oldest maid among them takes the leap. The agreement was to meet about half-way. I stopp'd an instant at the gabled house; There whistled through the dusk to haste her on; And straight the old house whistled; every nook, Gable, and cranny whistled, and my heart, E'en quicker than my ear, was on the beat. I ran, and hardly dared to look behind— The pelt of feet was after me; but soon The thing, whate'er it was, gave up the chase.— I stood a while on the bridge of the sleepy stream, And bent my eyes within its tide. I gazed Until it took me from myself. Methought I left my body on the bridge, and slid Away into perdition on the back Of a gigantic snake. A leaping trout Restored me, and I breathed—I felt I breathed. By this, some bold bright stars, like pioneers, Were breaking through the prairies of the skies, And on our meads arose the creeping rime; The air felt wet all round; and yet, no Jane! O, hadst thou not been pulling at my heart, My Margaret, my magnet, I'd have felt All this were pleasant fooling. I have chased A will-o'-wisp through many a squander'd night, And may be none the poorer for the waste. The heart that has no idol to enshrine Is free to sow its hours on thriftless winds: It reaps unconscious increase; does no crime. But thou art my religion; every hour To thee not dedicated is rank sin. Pity, the cause of sin felt not its hell! Thou, Jane, shouldst roast for this. [Exit. ACT V. Scene I. A Room in Eliza's Cottage. Eliza. He loves not me—he may love, but not me. My heart o'erflow'd its love into his eyes, The conduits of his heart; it filter'd through, And seem'd to leave in him nought but the sands. His presence, constantly, would drain my heart, Which, getting no return, would cease to love. Were all the dews earth breathes into the air Not lavish'd back again upon the earth, Parch'd earth would soon have nothing more to give. Better be mateless, then, than match'd with him. Better! Harsh argument! It could not be: He is not to be reason'd from my heart. Yet, would that I had seen one hope of Spring In all the Winter of his speech—one beam Behind that black ice of his eye, to tell There was a coming Summer in his heart. But there was none; and when he took my hand To bid Good night, I felt 'twas but a hand That touch'd me, not a spirit.—While he stayed I could not realise the full despair, For mine he was, as much as eyes could hold: But when he went, without one poor exchange— A look, a sigh, on which a thought might hang,— O misery! But peace: thy bitter dregs, Sweet Hope, I drain, and throw away the cup.— I've pour'd my soul into a fine ideal, Imagined it a lover, and loved that. Away, sweet dream, that seem'd my waking day! Be what thou art, a dream; and, like most dreams, Leave not on memory one scratch of truth By which thy foolish reign might be recall'd. (Knocking without.) Edward? Ah me! I had forgot the sad Announcement of his coming here to-night.— The loved unloving gone, and in his stead The unloved loving. Enter Edward.Edward. Eliza, by the weather in your face I read sweet summer changes. Why, you stand Like blue-eyed April, looking through her showers. But whence the tears—the showers? Eliza. From the clouds. Edward. Ay, but the clouds, Eliza, whence are they? Eliza. The sun exhaled them from this little earth, And when he set, they rain'd. Edward. Were I your sun I'd never set, nor leave so loved an earth. But truce to these poor similes—they limp.— Eliza!— Eliza. Edward! Edward. Ah! what need for speech? You know what I would say. Eliza. I do, I do: And therefore will I use no idle speech: I scorn to trifle with an earnest heart. Edward. Perfection perfected! Yet speak not thus If afterwards you do not mean to grant This heart the prize due to its loyalty: But rather let each word make less your worth, If I'm to be the loser of it all. Eliza. If you can keep a secret, here is one:— You shall not lose— Edward. O heaven!— Eliza. Till you possess. Edward. Who scorn'd to trifle with an earnest heart?— I'll risk the loss, if you will the possession. Eliza. But you are going on a tedious voyage: Full twenty moons will fill their orbs and wane, Ere Time redeem the pledges of our troth. Love's moon itself may wane with you ere that. Urge me no further now: when you return, If then— Edward. The doubt would kill me long ere then! My life is poison'd with the hope deferr'd; The food I eat is poison'd, and my sleep; And I am neither nourish'd nor refresh'd: I die even now. But ah! thou hast not known The agony of unrequited love. Eliza. (aside) A kindred sorrow kindles love: our hearts Are nearer by the binding of a grief. Edward. What would'st thou say, Eliza? With a word Thou could'st so sweetly medicine my soul, That none of all life's ills could e'er again Infect my being. Eliza. And if that could be, It were itself the greatest ill. We live By overcoming ills; and to be freed From feeling them were hopeless death. But no, That may not be: the present gone, 'twill seem That but some other ill has push'd it out, And stands there in its stead. Edward. Yet is it well To think the present ill shall be our last, Lest, feeling there's no end of them, we rest Desponding in the old, and thereby miss The very uses of adversity. Then, let me conquer the impediment To present bliss, and I'll be doubly steel'd For those that have to come.—But list! O love, The wind has whistled, and I know the tide Is almost waiting for me. 'Tis no time To analyse fine sentiments. In brief, Wilt thou be mine, Eliza—mine for aye? Eliza. (aside) Alas! What should I say? He loves me not; Nor show'd that night of love that closed him in, One ray to herald whence a dawn might come. Why am I fascinated with despair? Ah, wherefore can the ghost of an idea Lay hands upon my will? Away thou shade! (To Edward.) Edward, forgive me, I am not myself: I have no mind; take answer as thou wouldst. Edward. I will not bid thee speak it: plighted troth Has stood ere now on the unspoken word As firmly as on parchment. I can read The unwritten contract even in thy face. To such a bond be this the fitting seal. (Kissing her.) Now fare-thee-well, Eliza! Eliza. Nay, not yet. Come in and eat; and, while we sit, trace all Your voyage on the map, that day by day I may keep reckoning of your whereabouts. I'll keep a daily journal of the winds, Read dissertations on the law of storms, Be up in latitudes and longitudes, And in the papers turn to Vessels spoken with, Even before Births, Marriages and Deaths. Edward. The speedy winds shall be our messengers. The one that stirs your poplars here to-day May fill my sails to-morrow. Therefore give Each breeze sweet greeting, and a word for me. I'll entertain the rudest for your sake, And speed them round to you with freights of love. [Exeunt. Scene II. The Green before the Inn. The Inn lighted up. Music, dancing and laughter within. Enter Reuben. Reuben. How swiftly flies the heart on wings of love! Mine has been here an hour since, and my feet Have hardly yet o'ertaken it.—I hear The beat of Margaret's foot amid the dance. It comes into my soul like a sweet strain Play'd in the midst of thunder. As I came Over the bridge, her gorgeous figure dash'd Across the lighted blind; my spirit leapt, And even my arms involuntarily stretch'd To clasp the instant beauty. O, my brow, Flaming with thoughts of her, pants to be bathed In the luxurious bath of her dark hair. That battery of love, her burning lips, I almost shrink from touching the first time After the absence of a day, an age; The shock of ecstasy runs into pain. (Laughter within.) 'Tis her's, that dulcet laugh that ripples through The harsh-lipp'd merriment. She is the flute Amid the brazen music.—Here comes one Reel'd from the dance, all puffing hot and soil'd, And beaded as a haggis newly boil'd. [Exit Reuben into the Inn, passing Spanker, who comes from it. Spanker. Hot work! hot work! But O, that maid divine! Riches of womankind! Yea, each one's good Collected and transfused into one best! And now to think, to feel this treasure mine! Did I not say she'd be a mine, indeed, That I might work at leisure? Leisure! nay, She's too impetuous for a laggard's love. Have at her then: all duties else I throw Contemptuously aside; and on my knees Thus give my energies—Bah! that old man. Enter Bradbury from the Inn, and Spanker retires into the shade. Bradbury. How dark! bless me! I cannot see a stime! When one has lived a comfortable lie, How blind he is to its opposing truth! So I, with looking at the glare inside, Am blind to all the outlines of the night. We need to live a truth that we may see it; And when I've look'd a while into the night I'll see its faintest margins. Spanker. Ah! if love Spurr'd that old ass as hard as it spurs me, He could not amble thus with an idea. Bradbury. The knowledge of a fact comes by the brain; So thinks the world; but the affectional heart Has more to do with it than the world thinks. Spanker. The world's a fool, that's clear, and he a sage. Bradbury. Love gives the eyes to see what is unseen By others in the face of them we love; It gives the intellect to know their worth: Thus eyes and intellect without the heart Are impotent—mere tools without the hand. We all are better featured than we seem To the dispassionate external eye: The heart's eye, it alone, can see the true. How else amid this troop of dashing youth Who—for I will admit the fact—outstrip The falsely seen John Bradbury,—and all Apparently in madness for her hand,— How else could she set all aside for me, Unless John Bradbury, the truly seen, To her heart's eye, outrivall'd all of them? I'll bear me more supremely—'tis my right. Ye eyes of night, look at me, and endorse What Margaret's consummate taste approves. Am I not he, the destined man? Spanker. I thought The imagining faculty belong'd to youth. Enter Juniper and Friend from the Inn. Bradbury. Rheumatics seize his shanks! He crosses me Not only in the rosy ways of love, But on the glebes of ruminating thought. The darkness favours me, I will withdraw Within the sombre shadow of the wall. Friend. But, Will, I see you have powerful opposition. Juniper. Yes, in numbers; but what of that? Numbers in love, my boy, are not like numbers in war. Here it's every one for himself. Take each singly, and I've no opposition. What are they? That kangaroo who talks so much about Australasia and gold finding; he'll find no gold here, I can tell him. He made his appearance only the other day, and presumes already to hope. He leaps too far at a time, that fool. Spanker. (aside) It won't be too far to leap down your throat, and that's what I may do before all's done. Juniper. Then Daddy Bradbury, what's he? My butt, my foil, my background. He serves but to throw me more fully into Margaret's eye. These are a sample of the opposition. There's none! I tell you she's mine; I shan't even have to walk the course. Bradbury. (aside) No: for it's not intended you shall win the race. His butt! his foil! his background! If I had but a part of his youth on my side, I'd butt him, and foil him too, and give him a background into the bargain: the dirtiest part of the road should be his background. Friend. That may all be well enough; but women's fickleness is proverbial; and sometimes they make such a villainous choice—love being reputed to be blind— that even old Bradbury— Bradbury./ (aside) Even! He dare not say that to my face. Friend. Who's this comes spinning like a top? Stand aside, or he'll waltz over us. Enter Hopkins from the Inn.Hopkins. The reel, the waltz, the intoxicating whirl, The pressing bosom of that glorious girl, The cheeks of ruby and the teeth of pearl, The sable tresses, their enamouring curl, The springy limb, the eye of fiery jet, The bust that might owe Angelo a debt, A one in which the graces three are met, Whom luck calls mine, and I call Margaret! (Whirls off.) Friend. I'll bet you, Will, he robs you of your treasure. What woman could withstand both rhyme and measure? Enter Wheeler and Greene from the Inn. Wheeler. I told you I should make it all right for you. Greene. She's got the ring on, I see. Wheeler. Yes, and did you see how her attention was divided between it and you? Greene. You'll drink at my expense to-night, Jack. Wheeler. O dear, no—that would be too much. Greene. You shall. She's a splendid girl, Margaret, eh? Wheeler. Well, but it's not for a brother, you know, to praise her over much. Greene. When it does come off, Jack, you'll be best man, of course. Don't you think she would come out and take a walk with us? It's so oppressively hot inside! Besides, there's so many, I can't get spoken with her. Wheeler. Well—ah—I'll try. Just walk you over the bridge there. [Exit Greene.] What a monstrously silly fool that is! He has not cut his eye-teeth yet, or he would see through my glaring deceptions. The breach that was between her and me is now completely fill'd up by his ruins—the broken-down walls of his suit. They must not speak together, though. I'll after him and send him a wool-gathering, so that they may not meet to-night at all. By to-morrow night, please the pigs, she'll be too much mine to care for him or any one else. [Exit. Bradbury. They know I'm here, and have made up this among them—pure envy at seeing an elderly man preferred. Juniper (to friend.) His name is Wheeler—empty as a bell—all talk and bluster. Don't you be frightened for me. I tell you it's all settled between me and Margaret. Spanker. Surely there can be no reality in all this. She would not, could not speak to me, look at me,—yea, let me approach her as she does, and at the same time afford these fellows the inlet to her affections they seem to have got. No; it's a silly piece of tomfoolery made up among them, for what purpose I know not. —Here comes a decent country fellow. Surely he is not one of them. Enter Car from the Inn. Car. Well, we're keepin' it up ony way. Them town chaps is squeezin' Merget rayther more till I like though; but yet a-wouldn't gie the wink hoo casts me at every turn for all their squeezin's. I'll have all that to mysel' in another week. Aigh isn't hoo pritty the neet, wi' her glossy black heur dancin' at her cheeks? —Wain't I be proud when I see my name abuv that door? A peanter might mann it better till me too; but them raskets is like cobblers. Gie a cobbler your shoes to heel and he soles them as weel, and nails you into three-and-sixpence, instead o' ninepence. Merget would pay it certainly: but it's all one for that; what's hoo's is mine. Spanker. Even this simpleton is into the trick. Can it be aim'd at me? I will try.—My good fellow, will you take a glass with me? Car. Ay, I doan't mind if I do: I never likes to refuse nowt. Spanker. Before we go in, tell me now—there's a good fellow— What's the meaning of so many of you coming out and talking about Miss Riccard in this way—Margaret, as you call her—and zounds! each one of you pretending to be on the point of getting married to her? Car. Did thee hear it up in the town? Spanker. Hear what? Car. That hoo was baund to wed me. It's pritty well known now, I daresay. Them things will out. Spanker. That'll do, that'll do; don't think you've caught a flounder. Car. Flounder! Call Merget a flounder? I'll make a flounder o' thee—flat enough too! Spanker. There now, that's enough: a joke may be carried just a little too far. But come, be plain with me; I want to be your friend, if you only knew it. Car. Well, dash it! be my friend. What does thee want? Spanker. I want to know who set you on to this, and is it aimed at me? Car. I doan't know what thee means. Spanker. Why, this: You know very well that Margaret—Miss Riccard—would not take the like of you, and that— Car. Get out, you foreign Portuguese! Hopkins. (coming forward) Pardon me, sir; but am I to understand that you, sir, have any expectations in that quarter? Spanker. Excuse me, sir, I don't know you; but if you, sir, pretend to any expectations, I beg politely to remark that it's no use, it won't fit, and the sooner your name is Walker, the better. Hopkins. Your politeness is insulting, sir, and I beg to say that the sooner your name is Walker, the better. Bradbury. (coming forward) Gentlemen, you are exceedingly polite; but I beg to inform you [Enter Greene] that if Margaret—Miss Riccard—be the lady in dispute, you may keep your politeness for another; for she is engaged. Greene. Yes, gentlemen, to me. Bradbury. To me, sir; who are you? Juniper. (Coming forward and knocking their heads together.) You lie, Daddy, she's mine. Car. Yours, you snig! (striking him). Or yours! (striking Bradbury). Or yours either! (striking Greene). Greene. Holloa! here, Jack! help! help! thieves! they'll carry her away! help, Jack! Car. Get out, you're a set of poppies; I'll lick you all. (Hits them right and left, a general melée ensues, all striking one another, and enter Wheeler, who beats Greene.) Greene. Murder! Jack! Margaret! Any one! any one! [Exeunt all into the Inn, fighting and shouting. Enter Margaret, followed by Reuben. Margaret. What's all this noise? Reuben. Ah, now we are alone! Margaret. Hold off! Reuben. You do not know me in the dark! Look, Margaret, 'tis I! Margaret. I know, begone! [Exit into the Inn, shutting the door after her. Reuben. Begone! was that the word? or was it come? Begone! my ears deceived me! yet my eyes Bear witness, as she spoke that word, the moon Look'd o'er the edge of yonder bank of cloud, The light fell on her face, and I could see A very fiend glare at me, with no trace Of love or beauty left: it was Begone! O what a devil's glare! There's no such thing As outward beauty: no, the heavenliest sace Puts on at once hell's features if a fiend Takes up abode inside.—Hold off! Begone! Ah, whither could I go? These words have ta'en The very earth from me, with all its hopes: Life holds me only by one thread—despair. So have I felt in dreams, and waked with shrieks; But after thanking God, have slept again. Would I could shriek, and turn me, and forget This night as 'twere a dream!—And may I not? How know I it was Margaret? We danced A reel together scarce a minute since! And as we swept between the admiring lines My soul drank love from her upturnëd eyes: Yea, from her willing lips I snatched a kiss. Amid the scramble of the breaking-up dance And forming of a new, she left the room. I follow'd. Some disturbance brought her here. 'Twas nothing when we came: and seeing her Alone, and even, I thought, expecting me, I rush'd to press her to my heart—Hold off!— Methinks it was not Margaret at all. In coming out I've miss'd her in the crush, And this has been some other. O fool, fool! Some other heart's divinity! Blest pair! They whisper even now inside the door. Suspicion justifies me if I listen, To be still more assured it was not she. (Listens.) His love is not ethereal: that voice Has never yet been touch'd with the soft oil Wherewith love's angels trim their wings for flight. Ah, now she'll speak.—Curst be my ears! that sigh Was Margaret's; and, death! it is her voice! She loves another! O, infernal thought! It leaps like fire within me. Would to God That from the calendar this night would drop, And Time close up the blank! What have I done, Or left undone, that from her heaven of love Thus suddenly, unwarn'd, she casts me out? And who is he that she has made a god? 'Twere well I saw him—saw him with her eyes— That I might know the attribute I want. Ah, if she bear him only half the love She seem'd to hold for me! she does not—no! All love has gone from her—love that imparts The angel to humanity. That thing That stood before me in sheer ugliness, And croak'd the fiendish words Hold off! Begone! Retains no love for any one: for love Reflects itself, and makes all else beloved: The heart that thoroughly loves one loves all, And could not be a fiend to any one. Enter Joseph from the Inn.Joseph. O ho! and that's her game! If I were him— As, praise be blest, I am not,—Reuben, eh? Why, I've been looking for you up and down, In every room and corner of the house. Reuben. What for? Joseph. For company. The mirth is up, And twice they've knock'd down Reuben for a song. No Reuben answers, nor is Margaret there; And so, 'mid jealous looks, the whisper runs That she and you have other fish to fry. Reuben. Our fish is fried and eaten, and the bones Stick in my throat. Joseph. I could have guess'd as much. Reuben. You guess'd? From what? Joseph. From what to-night I've seen. She hath a score of wooers in that house. Reuben. I know; but what of that? they make no speed. Joseph. Love blinds you, Reuben—they make speed enough: Her lips are common as a village green, And all the geese graze on them. Reuben. Rogue, you lie! I know it is a lie. 'Tis true they seek, Ay, scramble for that luxury; but they Taste not the fervid lips she gives to me. Joseph. I saw her even now, behind that door, Close bosom'd with a man. Reuben. What kind of man? Joseph. A publican and sinner, both in one;— Cutely they call him, he that keeps the inn Up there in Fleukergate; who beat his wife— Ay, beat her, so they say, till she, poor soul, Was fain to quit that blacken'd tenement Her body, which he buried some three weeks since. Reuben. I'll not believe it, Joseph. Two round years I've been her loving servant; night by night Have fann'd her beauty with impassion'd sighs; I have not miss'd a night, yet never once Have seen that man on the contested ground. Besides, in him there's no attraction—none! Joseph. There's money, boy, money—lots of that! Reuben. True; and the fact relieves me. I had deem'd That I had gain'd what money could not buy: If she can set a price upon herself, She stands not in my market. So adieu, My pretty huckster, get what price you can. Come, Joseph: by the river's meady side The moonlight paves a meditative walk. We who have ever been the last to move When Mirth and quiet Humour at the board Sat President and Vice; who oft ourselves Have added an appendix to the night,— For once shall be the first.—I know not which, Wisdom or Folly, draws us most; we've been True knights of both perhaps, but now I feel A desperate inclining to be wise. Joseph. God help our wisdom, and our learning too! Your Latin mends a pen, my Greek a shoe; We be not classic, but plain English fools, And none can call us debtors to the schools. Reuben. God's universal book is writ in thoughts: The Tongues have merely turn'd it into words. We cannot read translations, and are forced To go to the original. That's all The secret of their scholarship. Let's go. [Exeunt. Scene III. —A Room in the Inn. Margaret and Cutely. Cutely. True, true, it is uncertain; life's uncertain: but I'll make it two hunder pound a-year, that is per annim, if I die. Margaret. Two hundred pounds—that is two hundred pounds. Ah, well, life's so uncertain. A written contract, of course? Cutely. Black on white. Margaret. Yes, well,—that's over and above what the law might allow? Cutely. By course. The law you know is the law; but this is certain and sure. Margaret. Then, there's that dear little boy, your son. Cutely. He'll be provided for. Margaret. By law? or— Cutely. No; let's see though—yes: ah, well, we'll see about that after. Margaret. O, certainly, see about that; make it something definite, you know, dear little fellow! Cutely. Yes, yes; all them things can be settled, when we get settled ourselves. Margaret. Ah, but life, you know, life is so uncertain, and there's no time like the present. Cutely. I'll do it to-morrow. Where's your mother? Let's arrange about the wedding-day. Margaret. We've some sharp young men in the house now— attorney's clerks, and the like. One of them could do the settlement, and— Cutely. O, any barber's clerk could do that.—I understand there's something they call a special license, that one can get at once. Now, what day would be convenient? Margaret. —And we've writing things in the house. It could be going on in another room, while I consult my mother about the day. Cutely. Very well, very well; go get your pen and paper —some ink too; and if you can pick me out a clerk that can keep a thing, do so. [Exit Margaret.] Ay, that's the sort for me; a girl of business. My affairs is running into a ravel since my poor, dear Maryhann, heaven forgive me, died; and I must have another at once.—She'll have money, too, money; old Riccard cannot last for ever. They tell me she has some fifty after her on that account—young, penniless shavers, that don't know how to take a woman. I've had my eye upon the girl these two weeks; but never spoke with her before to-night. Every man—and woman— has her price, as the poet says: and very proper too. Re-enter Margaret. Margaret. Now, love, everything's ready—young man and all— in the little back parlour, No. 7. Cutely. Kiss me Margaret. (Kisses him.) There; send me in a pipe and tobacco; and let's have a bottle of sherry over the job; and come yourself in a little, to see that it's all nicely written. They tell me you can do something in that way. You'll have all my writing to do. [Exit Cutely. Margaret. (throwing herself into a chair) Mother! [Enter Mrs. Riccard.] Mother, my bannock's baked for life. Mrs. Riccard. I thought it would, my girl; I told you that was the right sort of man. What has he come to? Margaret. Two hundred pounds a-year, settled and certain— send him in a pipe and tobacco—that is on his death, you know—and a bottle of sherry into No. 7. Mrs. Riccard. Bless my heart! two hundred pound! Well, well, well, well. [Exit Mrs. R. Margaret. (rising) Two hundred pounds at death, and twice my age. Besides, the law, despite his will, allows One third, I think, of all his moveables.— He's not so handsome as I could have liked. Then there's that brat, that boy by his first wife: Ay, what of him? He shan't be in the house, With young ones of our own: I'll board him out With some one who—he's delicate, poor thing, And may not live long.—But, about the day:— 'Tis Friday now—say this day week—no, no; Friday would be unlucky—Wednesday— 'Tis not too soon.—Two hundred pounds a-year! And what will Master Reuben think of that?— O name not Reuben! would to heaven it were Two hundred pounds and Reuben! or half that! Love, love, methinks, were worth the other half. Or nothing! if he had the name of rich. His name's a golden key that opes my heart: Where art thou, Reuben? Ah, come back, come back! Two hundred pounds! two hundred wither'd leaves— Are scatter'd by the breathing of thy name. Re-enter Mrs. Riccard. Mrs. Riccard. He wants you, Margaret—run, my girl, fly—he's made of money—but run to him. See you! here's fifty pound he's given me to buy livery for myself and the wenches—but go, go—any prints will do for them —and there's other fifty yonder for yourself, to buy dresses with—away with you! Margaret. Other fifty! he must indeed be made of money! What have I been thinking of! Mrs. Riccard. Run, run, there's no time for thinking. [Exeunt. Scene IV. A Country Road. Reuben. We do not often reason into faiths— We mostly grow into them, and to-day, Not knowing wherefore, we adopt beliefs Which yesterday we could not. There are truths That reason may reject; yet there they stand; And, by some inward faculty received, Become our chiefest glory, greatest joy. The underlying God within my mind Is necessary to my thought, as Time To the division of the days and years.— Eternal life to every human soul Is needed to complete the thought of life, And round the highest vision. What! to all Those cities-full of festering souls? to all? Ay, even so: the nature of that life, Being unlimited, demands them all. God works with the infinities, and thoughts That lead us on and lose us amid these, First stagger, then sustain. I almost feel The fact that we can think eternity, Is proof that we shall live it: for a thought Is, after all, the very soul of life. How poor seem all material interests Unless they have a corresponding soul!— And which indeed they have. The thing may pass, Be lost; yet leave with him that weeps the loss, Its most essential self. So even now 'Tis possible that we might truliest live As 'twere in the interior of things: A realm that passes not—the very Heaven That all are striving for, and yet so near!— There was a time when this had been mere words, Weak breath, and borne me nothing: some one thought Is given to us, and becomes a key Into a very hemisphere of thought. It is the same with love. O there is one Whose love-fill'd eye has seem'd to hang on me Like that fine star, which threatens even now To fall into my soul; and yet to me What was she but a name—until to-night? And now, dear one, my brain shoots beams of love That centre all in thee. I've been till now Dazzled to blindness by a love of fire, And miss'd my better angel. Had'st thou been More of the earth, Eliza, I had reach'd Thy sphere of love ere this: but thou hast still Been lofty and retiring; used no wiles, No witchery of motion, manners, dress; And seem'd to hold the province of a heart As sacred ground, not to be rudely trench'd. O if, Eliza, I have been or am More than a mere acquaintance in thy thoughts, Blot from thy memory my heartless past, And from the ordeal of a lowlier love I'll bring a heart the worthier of thee. [Exit. Scene V. A Room in Eliza's Cottage. Eliza seated, with a Map before her. Eliza. He should be here, here, where he said the sea Was of a deeper blue than my own eyes.— Alas! how is it with me? I am faint; And something like a mist is on the map. 'Tis nothing.—And to-morrow he'll be there.— O! he has gone with radiance on his soul, But left me dark in spirit, ill at ease.— This hand I plighted, and before he left I felt that I had given him all my heart. And so I had; but, like a new-drawn tooth, I feel as if the fragment were left in That caused the pain.—Then, in about a week, The Falkland Isles—no, no, I've lost my course: My thoughts are crowded, I am press'd with thoughts, Yet to no end or purpose can I think. (A knock.) Come in, and welcome, be ye whom ye may; Come any one, and take these thoughts away. Enter Reuben. Ah, Jane! I am so glad, so very, very glad. Reuben. And so am I, to find you are so very, very glad. But where is Jane? She was not telling me— Eliza. Is she not with you, then? Not ill, I trust, not ill? Be seated, Reuben, and tell me. Reuben. She is well. 'Tis I that am ill. Eliza. And you do well to walk for it. There is nothing better than a country walk for a slight illness. Reuben. And you with me, Eliza. Eliza. (aside) Ah!—what means he? Reuben. O! how may I approach you, how obliterate the old impressions you must have of Reuben? Eliza, I— I love you. Eliza. O, God! too late! too late! Away, dear Reuben! Leave me! I cannot—may not—O, you are too late! Reuben. Too late! O, how? Eliza. I am another's! I—I am betrothed. Reuben. O! thou hast plucked my soul out! I have no thought, no word—dumb silence all! Eliza. O! Reuben, I did love thee—love thee now; and even yesterday would—O, God! God! Farewell— thy presence maddens me. O leave, for Heaven's dear love. Reuben. I go, Eliza! but the love of Heaven methinks I leave behind. Farewell! Be happy, and—forget me. [Exit. Eliza. He should have said forget, and then be happy— Not happy and forget.—O! I could pray That thou, my God, would'st teach me to forget, But that thy will is visible in this, And rules it as it is. If thus to-day He loves me, surely yesterday he loved. What unseen finger then lay on his lips, Or held back in his eye that tongue of light, And loosed them now to speak unto a heart That dares not hear?—I have been as a tree, Whose inward principle of life is love; Which from the earliest spring has budded out Nothing but leaves of sorrow. Surely now I've reach'd the full flow'r of my agonies! And next, in Heaven's good time, must come the fruit; Bitter or sweet, I leave with thee, O God! Scene VI. A Country Road.Reuben. She is not lost—she is not lost to me— Although another man may call her his. What is it that possesses? 'Tis the mind. These arms for this inner self can nothing hold; And that I love in her, no hand can touch. Is she not mine, then, since my mind is fill'd, And all my bosom flooded with her being? This light that lighteth me comes from her eyes, And 'tis the light of soul that never sets: I take her very spirit in as breath, And seem to think, and feel, and speak, and act By the high standard of her excellence. Is she not mine? Who can possess her more? Do we have life? Not more than I have her. A thing is ours to the extent of love We put upon it. All this glorious earth Is by that tenure held. Its landed lords Are not a whit more lords of it than I. As well lay out those blue domains of air And call them theirs!—They would too, if they could— But that they cannot—save by love, love, love. True love wastes not its object—love is lust When it consumes; and therefore many hearts May love one being, and that still remain The all-sufficient object of their loves. In this fine picture, this fair outer world, Eliza, we shall never meet again! Yet say I not adieu, for thou art here, Here in the more abiding world of thought. And what should part us now? The cease of love— That only. Then have we for ever met; Since this our passion, even at its height, Pass'd from the world of death into mind's heaven, Where all things are immortal. There I'll build For thee a temple of my purest thoughts, And christen it the Temple of Eliza; That through all future time our love shall be A sweet devotion and a joy to me. [Exit. THE END. MISCELLANEOUS. HOUSE-HUNTING. The fact is too well known for repetition, That man is never pleased with his condition, And yet it is a truth that, even though old, Consoles poor fallen mortals when re-told. However home into the heart it strike, E'en be content—all mankind are alike: However out of place your lives may be, What matter if, when changed, no change you see? So each takes to his own again, right glad To think his neighbours' troubles are as bad; Or that his lot unto another's mind May seem as good as he need wish to find. Now if the text thus given need extension, Take for the sermon Brown, his wife and mansion. Their present house seem'd all that man and wife Could want to make a comfortable life— That is, so far as earthly mansion can Comfort the heart of any wife or man; But yet they growl'd, in accents shrill and gruff; They both were tired of it—and that's enough: And so to Robins, the great auctioneer, Brown gave instructions, definite and clear, To advertise it to be let or sold, Its tenements, messuages, field and fold. But lest a curious public should effect Too easily admission to inspect, Locality and name of the domain Should be withheld—inquirers to obtain These at the office of the auctioneer, Also the terms of sale, or rent per year. To find a new house Mr. and Mrs. Brown Had been all round the outskirts of the town. In order to economise the day, They went exploring in a separate way, And home at eve, each eager to express The day's exploits, both radiant with success; And as they chatted o'er their tea and toast, 'Twas hard to say which had succeeded most:— “Believe me, Brown, it is the finest thing We've seen—almost a palace for a king— So closely wooded, and so snug withal, The rooms so large, yes, and the rent so small; A mansion built when building was more rare, With labour cheap, and plenty ground to spare; Grandly palatial in its gates and walls, Broad flights of steps and spacious entrance halls, Elizabethan windows, gables, towers, An ample garden, stock'd with fruits and flowers, And, bless your heart, a rookery of rooks, Wherein the library or study looks, Throstles and blackbirds in perpetual song— A sort of paradise the whole day long.” Here Brown broke in, “Restrain yourself, my dear, Nor be so jubilant, until you hear The sort of house that I have seen to-day, And then you'll change your note, I'm bound to say. Not one of those mediæval haunted halls, Where every footstep echoes and appals, But one of modern build, with all the best Improvements of the age—among the rest, High ceilings, ventilation, faultless drains, Great windows, each of two strong plate-glass panes; (And light, by modern science has been shown A requisite of health—a thing not known In former times;) then water, cold and hot, Through all the house, with bath-rooms, and what not? All heretofore unused, too, I presume,— And by the way, there's gas in every room. But what about the garden, do you say? The ground's too precious to be thrown away, And so there's none—'twill be a care the less; Each luxury is but one more distress.— Where is the house? That's where the attraction lies; The situation is the thing we'll prize. It overlooks the Alexandra Drive— The newest line of fashion, and alive With all the pomp and beauty of the town.” “Humph—beauty!” cried the lady, with a frown: “I will not have the house, no, dearest Brown, Just think of my house as with yours compared; Indeed, comparisons may well be spared— They are as different as night and day—” “The very words,” cried Brown, “I was to say— As different, in fact, as day and night; But of the two mine's the more fair and bright, And consequently stands for day, you know.” “Comparisons are odious, Brown, and so, To save dispute, you may as well resign All thoughts about your house. Just look to mine— The sweet seclusion, the abundant room, The grand antiquity, the wooded gloom, The rookery, the garden and the birds, With all the etceteras such a place affords! My dearest Brown, I wonder that you don't Jump after such a house!—” Cried Brown, “I won't; Your dim secluded dens, have ever been The nurseries of ennui and the spleen; Your gardens are rheumatic, trees are damp, And to a person of a studious stamp Your birds were an intrusion; as for rooks, Their din would drive the devil from his books! I must have life and quietude combined— Something to cheer as well as soothe the mind; And this is in the mansion of my choice— Light, airy, free from all gross rural noise— Seclusion broken only by the rush Of cheerful carriages and glints of plush.” “Hum—plush!” sneered Mrs. Brown, and toss'd her head: “We seem to differ in our tastes,” she said; “And so I think we'd better go to bed.” They went, and it may fairly be presumed They took their houses with them, and resumed The subject, each in solitary guise— A mood wherein we all are wondrous wise. Next morning, over breakfast, they at first Were silent, though 'twas clear both were athirst To speak their minds—it might be said they burn'd— And therefore to the subject they return'd. Said Mrs. Brown, “My dear, you could not guess What I've been thinking—for I will confess I am myself surprised to find it so— The house you've been so pleased with, do you know, On second thoughts, I rather like it too”— “But I've had second thoughts as well as you,” Cried Brown; “and if the truth must be confess'd, I like your Elizabethan house the best. There's that about these fine old halls which blends Divinely with our thoughts, and even lends The mind a touch of the dramatic age, When England's best possession was the stage. I even think the cawing of the rooks Would help to deeper meaning in my books. And then the high-wall'd garden, with its walks Of ancient-smelling boxwood and sweet stalks Of hoary lavender,—there's much in this”— “No, no, as for the house, it's not amiss; But this is merely sentimental stuff, Of which, between us two, we've had enough. Last evening I was wrong, and you were right; I've turn'd the matter over in the light Of common sense, which says, with ready tongue, This morning I am right, and you are wrong. Thus being equal, dearest Brown, agree To leave the taking of the house to me.” “Peace, peace,” replied her lord; “pray who made you The judge of right and wrong, of false and true, And taught you such glib verdicts to dispense 'Tween sentimental stuff and common sense? And now you would consign me to the shelf, And have the taking of the house yourself! With all my heart, if you will leave alone What you miscal my house, and take your own.” “No, never, Brown, dear Brown, will I consent To have my fixed determination bent. I've thought the houses over, one by one, And this is the conclusion—yours or none!” Now what could Brown, or any other man, Do after this? He took the quiet plan; And since the grey mare was the better horse, Fell to the morning papers, mute, of course. But long he had not rustled them and read, When, turning to his spouse, he blandly said, “My love, there's plenty houses to be had— Houses of all sorts, good as well as bad. Now here's a house embracing, I opine, The best attractions of both yours and mine. ‘Strong-built, substantial mansion,’ and so forth. ‘A southerly exposure; on the north Well sheltered by a thickly-wooded range Of hills. About an hour's walk from the Exchange. Extensive suites of rooms’—and all the rest. ‘The situation is pronounced the best Within ten miles of town. Romantic view. Fine vista, with the river peeping through. An opportunity not to be lost.’ A likely place,” continued he, and toss'd The paper to his wife, and bade her read: “It is,” said she, “a likely place indeed; Yes, lawn in front, and garden in the rear. Apply to Robins, our own auctioneer! We should not lose a moment; go at once: I look upon it as a lucky chance— A providential, accidental miss— We did not fix before we look'd at this.” “Well then,” said Brown, “in order to agree About this house, I hold it safe that we Go after it together.” So they went, And found the busy Robins all intent Framing advertisements. First they desired To know if any one had yet inquired After their own house, but seem'd not to look For any ready answer; for Brown took The paper from his pocket, and said, “Here's A house that, from the advertisement, appears The very thing for us. Is it yet sold? What is the price? and is it new or old? Where situate? Is its present owner dead? Or wherefore—” Robins laugh'd and wagg'd his head: “Excuse me—dead! no, no,—he and his wife, I'm glad to see, are in exuberant life. But, sure, a plain description might have shown This house that took your fancy was your own!” Brown stared at Robins, Robins at them both, And they look'd puzzl'd, half perplex'd, and loath To own they could have made the strange mistake; But, seeming from their muddle to awake, Rejoiced so fair a mansion was unsold— Nor would they sell it for its weight in gold. SIR PETER'S CURE. Some masters are so puff'd up with conceit, They think their servants dirt beneath their feet. At best mere cattle to be driven in reins, Not fellow-beings with the use of brains, Further than comprehend their brief commands, Then execute them—not with heads but hands. But old Sir Peter, who was of this class, Got cured, and this was how it came to pass. A favourite horse, that cost five hundred pounds, Was sent to grass outside the manor grounds, For some disorder, as was understood, That wanted rest, free air, and change of food; And once a-day, at least, the Knight contrived To walk across and see how Roland thrived. One sultry day, when strolling in the park, He spied some distance off, all stiff and stark, This famous hunter lying on his side, With legs and tail outstretch'd, and nostrils wide. “Yes, yes, I knew 'twould come to that,” he said; “A noble beast—five hundred pounds—dead, dead!” Then straightway to the hall his steps retraced, And called his groom: “Here, sirrah, sharp, make haste, Be off, get all the needed help you can, And skin me Roland!” “But, sir—” cried the man, “You have your orders, go, bring me the skin— A sorry prize by such a horse to win.” After some hours the groom came up the road Behind the manor, bending with his load; And with Sir Peter chancing there to meet, He laid the burden at his master's feet:— “Sir, there is Roland's skin. I think he knew We came to take it, for he up and flew At such a sweep as only bird could match— Never before was he so ill to catch!” “You thoughtless rascal! skin a living horse! Was he not dead, you villain?” “Yes, of course, After we killed him—dead enough, and still; But he was ill to catch and hard to kill.” “You fool, you implement, you brainless man, You've killed the noblest horse that ever ran: Roland the brave, Roland my only pride, Slain by an ass, diminish'd to a hide! See what it is to want a thinking head! You might have known I thought the horse was dead.” “Ay, so I might, Sir Peter,” cried the groom, “If in your orders you had left me room To use this brainless and unthinking head; But what are orders, sir, if not obeyed?” “True, John,” replied Sir Peter, “you are right; So take this gory record from my sight. I still must order, and you must obey; But there's the literal, and the other way; And if you take the latter, I will wink At the offence, and give you leave to think.” FORBIDDEN FRUIT. Sir Peter and his groom were on their way To Foxdale Castle, there to spend the day, Perhaps the morrow also, if they found The dogs in fettle and the sport abound. They rode along in silence. When not quite A mile upon their way, the thoughtful Knight Pulled up his horse, and, turning to his man, “Ride back,” he said, “as smartly as you can, And tell my lady that she's not to speak To Binns the butler, when I am from home, Not even if I tarry for a week; Be off, and I'll ride slowly till you come.” Now as the groom rides back, it may be told, That while Sir Peter was both gray and old, Her ladyship was in her blooming prime— 'Twas Hebe in the hoary arms of Time. The butler, too, to make the matter worse, Was pleasing to the eye, and young of course. But that Sir Peter had the slightest cause For jealousy, 'twere wrong even to suppose. As up the avenue he rode, the groom Espied the lady in the drawing-room, At open window, with the gauze withdrawn, And just one step between her and the lawn. She stood enrapt within a new romance, But startled by the groom's abrupt advance, She in sweet consternation dropt the book, And cast on him a fine, defiant look. “Fellow, what brings you back? What seek you here? Get to your stables! Is Sir Peter near?” “No, madam; but he sends me back to say— And, first, your pardon I would beg and pray, For I am but the instrument, the horn Through which Sir Peter's warning note is borne.” “Quick, quick,” she cried, what need of this delay? Sir Peter's horse has fallen, you would say, And dash'd Sir Peter's head against a stone, Broken his limbs, his ribs, his collar-bone; Or horse and rider headlong in a ditch! Speak, fellow, speak this instant! tell me which.” “Fear nothing, madam, he is safe and well, And, with your pardon, I have but to tell The message that to me he did confide, Which is, ‘That you on no account must ride On the Newfoundland dog!’” With that he spurr'd His steed, and left without another word; As if he could not venture to engage The dreaded onset of my lady's rage. For rage she did, and storm'd at dogs and men; And, like a pretty panther in its den, Pac'd to and fro across the drawing room, Railing at old Sir Peter and his groom:— “Newfoundland dog!” she cried, “the dotard fool! Am I a child? a girl let loose from school? I must not ride on the Newfoundland dog! Who wanted to? Sir Peter, O Sir P! Your brains are in a muddle, in a fog, Your reason stranded, and your wits at sea.” Then, 'mid the scented breezes of her fan, And with the prettiest laugh that ever ran The gamut of hysteria, she took Her seat, and tried to settle at her book; The words she read, but knew not what she read,— Sir Peter's paltry message came instead; And as she threw the fruitless book aside, Behold, the dog, in all his strength and pride, Came bouncing o'er the lawn. “Ah, ha, my steed! I must not ride upon you! no, indeed! Sir Peter says I must not,—but I will. Come in, good dog. There, now, be still, be still. If he can bear me, what a jolly thing, To turn this room into a circus ring! Now then, my Shetland; steady, Neptune, steady! Sir Peter, hem! your most obedient lady! Bravo, brave dog, thus round and round we go, Whether Sir Peter like the pace or no. Yo ho! yo ho! how nice, how jolly nice! Thanks, good Sir Peter, for your good advice.” But here bold Neptune, in his circling sweep, Over a footstool made a sudden leap, And though she rode as do the masculine gender, He pitch'd her, heels o'er head, inside the fender, And left her, as they say, all in a heap. The maids and footman, summon'd by the crash Of tongs and shovel, burst upon the scene. They found her swooning, bleeding, and between Her nose and jewell'd ear a frightful gash. Some call'd for water, and some call'd for wine, Rags, balsam, bandages, and anodyne: They marvell'd how it happen'd, and agreed The shovel or the grate had done the deed. But soon her pale lips show'd returning bloom, And whisper'd, as they bore her from the room, “Bravo, my Shetland! quicker, quicker, there! Now stop us, poor Sir Peter, if you dare.” A messenger to Foxdale Castle sent Inform'd Sir Peter of the accident, Just as the dogs were ready for the fray, And all gave promise of a glorious day. His heart was braced to join the clanging pack, But duty and affection held him back. “Homeward, my men!” And as they homeward bent, He question'd much about the sad event; But all the breathless messenger could tell Was, that some sort of accident befell Her ladyship soon after he had gone, Its nature, how, and wherefore, all unknown. “We found her in a swoon; I saw her bleed.” At hearing which Sir Peter mends his speed; The sudden fire leaps from his horse's heels, The road-side trees fly past, the landscape reels. Nor breaks his pace until he halts to wait The drowsy porter coming to the gate. And, in a breath, dismounting at the hall, He seeks his lady's room, boots, whip and all. “Let him not enter!” cried a voice inside; And when Sir Peter finds himself denied, He turns in anger to the maids, who tell All how their lady's sad mishap befell, And how it was a shame, a cruel shame That gentlemen could find no better game. If they had husbands, they would let them know Them and their grooms and messages— “Go, go,” Sir Peter cried, and left their loosen'd tongues, In rising clamour about woman's wrongs. He reason'd with himself, “I cannot see How this Newfoundland accident can be Connected with the message that I sent. The butler's name through all the strange event Never appears;—but stay,—does that not add Suspicion to a case already bad? It does, it does; I've been befool'd, 'tis clear: His absence from this female clamour here, And my exclusion from my lady's room— What mean they but—Ah, come, my trusty groom, And help me to unwind this ravell'd clue. The very thing we told her not to do, She's done,—but find the butler, bring him here.” “My master, I have been to get my beer, After this hot ride home, and him I found Drunk in the cellar, snoring on the ground.” “'Tis well, my man; I'd rather have him there, Drunk as he may be, than some other where. Why, he's an honest fellow, after all— No way connected with these women's squall. But what about this drawing-room ado— My lady's fiction?” “Sir, I fear it's true, E'en to the rumour'd wound upon her cheek. Your orders were, ‘That she was not to speak To Binns, the butler;’ but for once I lied; I said your orders were, ‘She must not ride On the Newfoundland dog,’ and tho' I knew It was the likeliest thing that she would do, I did not think 'twould end as it has ended. Forgive me, sir, 'twas Duty that offended.” “Forgive you, groom of grooms and sage of sages! You are forgiven, and I'll raise your wages; For you have rid my bosom of its thorns, And saved me from a noble head of horns.— I'm sorry for my lady; but her case Is curable. A scratch upon the face Is not so bad, e'en tho' it leave a scar, As many matrimonial scratches are.— Take this;” and from his purse's silken fold, He gave the groom a piece of shining gold. Well pleas'd the solid offering to receive, He took it, and went, laughing in his sleeve. THE ROOKERY. So far as I know, there's no one knows Much of the inner life of the crows; But there's something human intertwin'd With all their habits, and to my mind The ancient, noisy Rookery Is as haunted a place as well can be. The trees with old age are hollow and hoar, With a rent near the root, like a half-open door; And the ghastly sound of the hollow ground, Starts up like a warning wherever you tread; While the croaking, cawing overhead Some quaint old woodland brogue appears; For they say the crow lives a hundred years,— And you'll often see patriarchal crows With big white carbuncles on their nose, That must have taken that time to grow; And by their cracked old croaks you may know They are come of an antiquated people: The creak of the rusty vane on the steeple, Or the swinging signboard over the way, Speaks not from an older world than they. And there's the dilapidated hall, With its gothic gables and chimneys tall: It is part of the Rookery now, I suppose, Grown into the old-fashion'd life of the crows; And I make no doubt if the chimneys could speak, They would tell us the same old carbuncled beak That croak'd on the roof when the old squire lay, Fighting with Death for one more breath, May be heard in the Rookery croaking to-day. There's the old churchyard, too, they know full well, Without being told by the funeral bell, When anything deadly is doing there, And make narrowing circles in the air, To reconnoitre, from on high, The grave where the well-known corpse is to lie. The well-known corpse, did I say? Ay, ay; For they know a deal better than you or I The neighbour that's ailing and going to die. One evening, when passing the Rookery, I heard two crows on an outside tree:— “Quhare haif yo bein, gossip Croak?“ quoth the one:— Quoth the other, “Just to see quhat good could be done In the old kirkyard—” “And what your reward?” “Red worms all over and fine white grubs At the new-happ'd grave of honest John Stubbs.”— Quoth the first, “Then to-morrow we'll all of us go, And hold a grand hilario!” At weddings, too, have you never seen, When the couples prance o'er the village green, With a smile and smirk on their way to the kirk, What a skelloching hulla-baloo would arise As the Rookery emptied into the skies: For the gossiping rooks without papers or books Know all the news of the country side— Croak for the corpse and caw for the bride. What a busy, busy time in the Rookery, When spring comes round and nests to be found, Almost a dozen on every tree! Four nests deep, how they manage to keep Each pair to their own, is a marvel to me! Building the new, and repairing the old, What a Babel of tongues! how they clamour and scold! No doubt like us, they have rights to defend, And perhaps like us, too, they borrow and lend; While some will thieve, and some show their greed, By massing up more than they'll ever need— Which of course will give rise to many a plea, And they'll have their lawsuits as well as we. How else account for all this babble, This “plucking of crows,” and perpetual squabble? The cawing clamour grows wilder still When eggs are hatched and mouths are to fill, Four or five gaping in every nest, And the old ones alighting from east and west, From north and south, and far and wide, With their dainty pickings to dole and divide. But there comes yet a noisier racket than all When the callow young crows flap out on the boughs, Tempted to fly, yet afraid they fall; And shooters appear from far and near, Round the old dilapidated hall— For the lord of the manor appoints a day, To come who will and shoot who may; And the shopkeeper leaves both scoop and scale, The carpenter stops at a half-driven nail, The smith drops the hammer, his bellows their blast, The cobbler kicks into a corner his last, The tailor jumps up with three cuts and a caper, Hops over his goose, and is off with the draper, And student and clerk throw aside their books,— For all are bent on the same intent— A regular racketing day at the rooks! And hark! what a row at the Rookery, As the shooters make head with their powder and lead, And the lärum is spread from tree to tree; The young on the branches, the old in the air, Screaming a curse and cawing a pray'r; And as crack, crack, crack go the belching pieces, The madden'd roar of the siege increases, Till the quietest sepulchres in the wood Are shrieking of broken solitude. But the long and noisy summer day, Comes to a close; and, with slaughtered crows, In bunches their foes go marching away; Stopping at Publics along the roads To wet their weazens and rest their loads.— The evening breeze lifts away the smoke, And the roar of the Rookery sinks to a croak,— Croak, croak, half the night through, About this battle of Rookieloo. A few more days of golden June, And the Rookery rises to famous tune. The young that were spared from the fiery assault, With full-fledged quill arise at will, And tumble and wheel through the azure vault. Both old and young let loose the tongue, And lord! what a song of madcap glee: For now their days are idle and long, And every one a jubilee. Up, up in the morning, up and away To some chosen field to feed and play, And home at night in gossiping flight And daft delight of their merry day; All fearless now of the treacherous gun, Or lure of the wiliest mother's son; For they scent his powder, see through his trick, And know when a gun is a gun or a stick: So a good wide berth they give to their foe, Slanting aside with an easy glide, And a fine contempt for all below. If they knew what an old-fashion'd love I bear For them, I am sure they would not care Though I sat up beside them in a tree And took down all their history. For I know they have something worth our ear, Which all my life I have yearn'd to hear; But woe is me! it may not be, They never will let me come so near. So this is all I may hear or see, About the rooks and the Rookery. THE WEASEL'S CAIRN. “They are varmints for money,” old Denis said, As he took off his hat and scratched his head, Where he stood in the field with his foot on his spade,— “Money they never in honesty made.” “And where do they get it?” “Steal it, to be sure; For a weasel will rob both rich and poor; Steal from the cabin, the church or the hall, Without any conscience for helpless or old, And not for a hap'orth of use at all, But just for the love of the silver and gold. Wherever the miser may bury his store,— In the garden three feet deep or more, In a hole of the wall or under the floor, Or behind the cross-beam over the door, Hidden, however securely or dim, It's known to the weasel as well as to him.— Sometimes it lives in the miser's house, In the crannied walls, like rat or mouse; But rats and mice leave their cozy homes When the bold little cunning weasel comes. Or it worms its way through the mouldy thatch, And up in the rafters keeps secret watch O'er the movements and doings of folks below, To see where their money is hidden, you know.— When the careful housewife counts her gear, Half dead for fear of anyone near, Stretch'd on a joist it leans its ear, For the clink, clink, clink, and chink, chink, chink, Is the sweetest music a weasel can hear. Its little black diamonds gleam at the sight, And its pretty white waistcoat heaves with delight: And aye, as the housewife clink, clink, clinks, That silver and gold shall be mine, it thinks. Or perhaps, it lies crouch'd inside of the wall, And peeps thro' a crevice so round and small, That anyone catching the glance of its eye, Takes it for the sheen of a blue-bottle fly. Then the miser, thinking all safe and sound, Creeps to his hoard, looking round and round, Pausing and list'ning in horrible fear At the thought of a footstep coming near, Falls down, and worships his god in the pose; But he little knows, he little knows That the blue-bottle fly is the weasel's eye Peering at him wherever he goes.” “But, when does the weasel help itself, And where keeps it all this ill-gotten pelf?—” “Why, just at the gray of the morning, sir, That sound sleeping hour when no one's astir. Ay, then may the weasel be seen on the hearth, A perfect wonder of playful mirth, Dancing around and dancing around A bright gold coin it has stolen or found. But, ere the red streaks light up the gray, It nips up its guinea and scampers away, Without e'en the faintest patter or noise, And up through the walls to the place of its choice; Or down through the floor to its crannied store, Somewhere about the foundation-stone, And drops its guinea among many more, To lie unknown, long, long unknown, Till all the folks are dead or away To the Irishman's home in Amerikay; When the poor old cabin is pull'd to the ground, And the long hidden wealth of the weasel found, As much as had kept them here at home For generations and years to come. You don't believe it, sir! By the lord, It's truth I tell ye, every word, And none knows the truth of it better than I; Just listen a minute and I'll tell you why. This very ground on which we stand— Twenty acres of arable land, Ten of old pasture, and ten of bog, And five of gnarly woody scrog— Five and forty acres all told My grandfather bought with a weasel's gold.— It's an old, old story, and it would not have done In his day to tell it to everyone, For fear of the treasure-trove, you know. But all are dead, both women and men, And in their graves an age ago. In this very field, he rented it then— On a sweet summer day as ever shone, He was digging potatoes here alone; And, raising his body to ease his bones, He look'd across at yon cairn of stones, The gathering of many a bygone day, With moss and mould all green and gray, And there he spied a weasel at play, Out and in through cranny and seam, And down the cairn like a jaggëd gleam Of lightning in a leaden sky, Or, leaving the cairn, it would scamper by, And down the potato furrows pass, Like a sunny brook through the meadow grass, Now leaping, now lost to the watcher's eye; Yet, ever and aye 'twould again return, To one little hole in the stony cairn, Where it hid for a while, then came peeping out, Looking up and down and round about. But once when it left, cried he, ‘By my soul, I'll see what there is in the weasel's hole.’ So he ran to the spot, and with nimble stroke Into its little castle broke, Picked out the stones, and the mossy mould, Deeper and deeper let in the light, Till he reached the last chamber, and lord, what a sight Of shining silver and gleaming gold! He could do nothing but stand and gaze, And his very heart stood still with amaze! He gazed till he felt himself gazing blind; But he heard the brush of the weasel behind, And then, oh dear, oh dear what a sound Of piteous misery and dismay Pierced through that quiet summer day When the weasel saw that its treasure was found! It sprang with one leap to its golden heap, Bewail'd and wrung its little fore-paws, And then with one of its sharpest claws— Would you believe it? it's past all belief!— Ript up its belly from tail to throat, Put off its skin like a cast-off coat, Lay down in its flesh, and died with grief! It's beyond belief, but true for all that— When he counted the money into his hat, There were spade-ace guineas three hundred and five, And ten pounds in silver, as I'm alive! So he laid the weasel and its skin Into the place where the money had lain, Built the cairn all up again, And pray'd for the honour'd dead within. And unto this day man, woman and bairn Give it the name of the ‘Weasel's Cairn.’” THE LOTTERY TICKET. John Skippangoe was footman to a squire, Willing and prompt as master could desire, And oftentimes his faithful service got Such recompense as all good service ought— The kindly word, the patronising joke, Which condescension in its turn awoke Familiar reverence in the breast of John. Full many gifts he gave him and anon A ticket for the lottery, sure to gain— The lottery of Frankfort-on-the-Maine. But honest John, though prodigal of thanks, Knew well his master's luck was all for blanks: In truth, both John and squire knew well enough The ticket was not worth a pinch of snuff. But, one day, when the squire was snugly set Over his breakfast, reading the Gazette, His eyes fell carelessly upon the list Of Frankfort prizes. Suddenly his fist Came down upon the table with a thump That made his egg out off the egg-cup jump:— “Can I believe my eyes? No, no,—yet zounds! It is John's ticket! eighty thousand pounds! For years and years have I this lottery tried, And still my luck was on the losing side; The most unlucky dog may have his day, But I, poor whelp, have given my turn away. Had it but been a hundred pounds or so, I could have bid my disappointment go; I would have e'en congratulated John, And sworn how glad I was that he had won. But eighty thousand pounds all in a crack! 'Twere well I think to get my ticket back.— No, no, not even a mint of money can Outweigh the honour of a gentleman, Whereas this breach of honour would distrain The very worth of its unworthy gain. John shall enjoy it; I will realise More interest from his joy than from his prize. And John's no common footman; I have seen A dash of higher breeding in his mien— A sort of gentleman in short; and Fate, Having seen the same, bequeaths him an estate.” Thus mused and mused the squire, till in the end Poor John seem'd not his footman but his friend. Such sudden wealth he thought as suddenly gave The attributes a gentleman should have; And, acting in the same becoming way, Invited John to dine with him that day. John marvell'd greatly how he could deserve This honour, he whose business was to serve, But stopp'd no fine-spun theory to draw, For well he knew his master's word was law; And whether said in earnest or in play, John's only argument was to obey. He knew their modes and manners just as well As any of the quality could tell; He knew the cut of collar, coat or vest, And came to dinner in the very best; So that, to judge of them by their attire, You could not tell the footman from the squire. It matters little how the squire had plann'd To let his wife and daughter understand John's new position; but their looks confess'd He was no more their servant, but their guest. The lady, ripen'd by long years and grief, Was falling fast into the yellow leaf: The daughter, though unwater'd by a tear, Was falling just as fast into the sere, And so, if all the truth must needs be told, Was shelv'd as something that could not be sold. Who knows but that the squire began to dream Already of some matrimonial scheme? A daughter ancient—and a footman rich— Might well suggest the hymeneal hitch. Nor does it matter how the dinner sped, How John was drunk to, patronized and fed. The viands and the wines went round galore, His health was drunk a score of times and more, As he some proper gentleman had been, And much he wonder'd what it all could mean. At length the ladies curtsey and retire, And John is left hobnobbing with the squire. “Fill up your glass John; try those sugar'd plums; Or there's some nuts to exercise your gums. And, hearken John—believe me if you can— You are in truth a perfect gentleman.” “True, sir, I've often heard your honour say An honest man, a man that paid his way, That stood his bets and never sold his vote, Although reduced to one last threadbare coat, Was still a gentleman.” “Yes, yes, true, true; But that's not what I mean; I say that you, John Skippangoe, plain John, may now aspire To dub yourself John Skippangoe, Esquire.” “I've done my duty, sir, that's all I know; And if it be your will that I must go, I cannot help it; but, at least, you'll give Me back my character—a man must live.” “Your character! pooh, pooh—who spoke of going? But certainly your character's worth knowing: A man of most uncommon common sense, Preserving honour without wasting pence; An instinct that requires no settled plan, But does the stroke that makes the prosperous man, And takes the world for what it really is; As fit to be my master as I his.” “Yes, yes, your honour, I can take a jest; But, since you've made me in some sort your guest, I'd be so bold as ask you how it comes That you and I should meet like equal chums?” “Because we are equal, both in means and mind; Your wisdom have I proved, and now I find That you are even wealthier than wise; For, hark ye John, your ticket's won a prize Of eighty thousand pounds!” “Alas, alas,” Cried John, “that such a thing should come to pass!” Then fumbled in his pockets, pulled his hair, And on his master fixed a stupid stare. “Why, what's the matter? Do you not rejoice? Your ticket—is it lost? or but your voice? Confound you, what's the matter? speak, man speak!” John scratch'd his head and said, “One night last week, While waiting for you at the Opera door, I dropt into the Bull with two-three more— All servants, sir—and having no money handy, I swapt my ticket for a glass of brandy.” “O fool! O stupid and enormous ass! Your ticket—eighty thousand—for a glass! You blockhead, simpleton, you worse than knave— Fate made you master, Folly keeps you slave: Go from my presence!”—and, to seal his doom, His furious master kick'd him from the room. THE WIDOW AND THE PRIEST. Outside our village, up within a croft, Shelter'd from all the winds except the soft Sweet clover breath that comes out of the west, There lived a widow in a lonely nest— A clay-built cottage in against a bank, Choked up with brambles, docks and nettles rank; Before the door a small potato bed, A bush or two of roses, white and red, Some herbs we used to know in days of old, As rue, and thyme, and balm and marigold; And one tall willow, in whose wiry top A pair of pyets came to jibe and hop: A sleepy place but for the little stream That brattled through the croft and broke its dream. For thirty years of lonely widow-hood She strove to make ends meet as best she could, Her chief support one small milk-cow that housed Within a little byre at night, and browsed All day among the whins, or took a turn About the herby borders of the burn: And if she straggled from the widow's ken A gentle calling brought her back again. And duly as the milking time came round, The little beast would at the door be found, Crooning of well-fill'd udders. Little need The widow had for watching, and indeed Long hours within the willow shade would sit, Or on some hillock, in the sun, and knit The coarse gray woollen stockings, which she sold About the village when the days grew cold.— This, with her scanty butter, milk and cheese, Made up her little stock-in-trade: and these Found ready market; for 'twas thought and said, The natural herbs whereon her cow was fed Gave to the milk rare virtues, and in turn The products of her chizzard and her churn. Thus did she by her merchandise provide The livelihood that never is denied To honest, careful labour, and could give A portion to the priest, as well as live. But here it was her brooding trouble lay; For left alone all thro' the thoughtful day, With priestly terrors rankling in her brain, And penal fears, and everlasting pain, She conjured up a load of outward sin Far more than one might carry, and within A poor, weak, helpless soul. “Alas!” cried she, “The holy Jesus never comes to me, To loose me from this burden of my cares; Nor will, save thro' a world of costly pray'rs: And what can my small pittance do to bring A poor old woman to her Lord and King!” While thus she mourn'd one day, her priest, as oft It was his wont to do, came up the croft. “O, reverend father, Heaven's own peace and grace Thou bearest with thee, shining in thy face! Grant only that their sunshine fall on me, And make me strong, yet thou no weaker be.” “Good woman, I have pray'd for thee, and sure Such loud and fervid pray'rs for one so poor Never went up before. Peter and Paul, The powerfullest among the older saints, and all The weightiest of the new, have been implored That thou to Christian comfort be restored.” “Ah, woe is me! so many holy saints To strengthen me, and yet my poor heart faints Beneath its load! Good father, what beside Is in thy power? Can nothing else be tried?” “No, nothing else: I have already given Thy money's worth in daily pray'rs to Heaven, And, out of charity, some aves more, For which I ask no pay.” “And yet no door Will open! Like a beggar I must wait, Pleading, with all my rags, outside the gate! Will no good saint take pity? Would a pray'r To God's own mother, Mary—” “Woman, forbear! Think'st thou a person of thy mean estate Need look for what we grant but to the great! No, no. 'Tis true the Virgin is alone, Of all heaven's holy hierarchy, the one Through whom an intercession could not fail; But what can thy small worldly means avail?” “Ah, reverend father, in good Mary's sight Perhaps my little, like the widow's mite, Would find much favour: try, good father, try; And if great faith be needed, that have I.” “Great faith is needed; but the price is much Above thy means, the intercession such As only wealth indulges in. Yet thou, I just bethink me, hast a good milk cow— And what are worldly goods to sins forgiven, A cleansëd heart, a place secured in heaven? What profits it a man to gain the whole Of earth, if, gaining that, he lose his soul? And, earth possessing, it were well he gave All up, if thereby he his soul could save.” Some while the widow sat without a word— Although her breast with much unrest was stirr'd— Brooding, with downcast eyes and thoughtful brow, Between her soul's salvation and her cow; And when she spoke 'twas with a sigh:— “Alas! We know not what a day may bring to pass: Why need we set our hearts on worldly gear, And death, that severs us and it, so near— So ever near that any footslip may From all our clinging hoards snatch us away! And then to die as unprepared as now! O, reverend father, thou shalt have my cow. But pray for me to Mary, Mother in Heaven, On bended knees, till I am wholly shriven.” It was agreed that he should pray and pray, And keep the courts of heaven, both night and day, For one whole week, with supplications plied— Enough to purify a soul, though dyed As black as sin itself—far more than lift Her burden off, and give her peaceful shrift.— All that was needed on both sides was this— Unbounded faith on hers, fervour on his. And for the rest, the cow might nibble there, About the croft, until the Lammas fair, A fortnight hence, when he would have her sold. Meanwhile the widow's grief grew manifold. If all those holy saints and all those pray'rs Have fail'd to rid her of her sinful cares, How great must these now be! So greatly more Than ever she had dreamt they were before, That even the Virgin's interceding word Unto the bar of Heaven may rise unheard! And to her crowding sorrows she has now To add the speedy parting with her cow:— “Alas! alas! the world has never seen Such friends, poor Crum, as thou and I have been. And must we part at last! And must we part— To save my soul—ay, ay—but break my heart!” Then would she hang upon its neck, or gaze Into its eyes, until she thought a haze Rose from their deeps and gather'd in a tear; And as the day grew nearer and more near When they must part, her fondness for the beast, Her fondness and her kindness, still increased.— She moved beside it both by burn and brake, And sadly shared with it her oaten cake. Now when the week of prayers was at an end, Up through the croft the priest was seen to wend, And coming on the widow and her cow, “Woman,” said he, “how is it with thee now?” “No better, reverend father, none, but worse; And all my life seems blacken'd with some curse That even holy church has not the power, I fear, to charm away, or priest to scour. O, reverend father, hast thou pray'd thy best?” “Good woman, I perceive thy great unrest Arises from a want of faith as great. For one whole week I've pray'd, early and late, For thee and thee alone, and am assured Thy soul's salvation is right well secured. Believe it, just believe it is, and lo! That very instant thou wilt find it so. This want of faith, my woman, is thy hell,— Yes, think all well with thee, and all is well.—” And ere she well knew what to think or say, He turn'd upon his heel and went away; While, in a trance of curious, mute surprise, Up through the croft she track'd him with her eyes, Beyond the knolls till through the upland gap His long, black breezy skirts were seen to flap. And then she sank into her own sad breast, As to the last extremity distress'd, All outward trust cut off, the last hope gone, Her sole reliance in herself alone. And long she brooded over her despair:— “If I have but to think his week of prayer Has brought me peace from Heaven, why might I not Myself raise comfort by the power of thought? My thinking or his praying—which, ay which, It matters not. If I could think me rich, Believe myself a duchess or a queen, I should not feel that I am poor and mean; If I can think away my sins, what need Of priest or holy church to intercede?” But while she reason'd thus, the priest's man came, With quick official strides. Said he, “Old dame, I'm come to fetch the cow.” She look'd him—Nay! “Go back to him that sent thee, man, and say He's got the cow: if not, be his the blame; Tell him to think he has—it's all the same!” And there was such commanding in her look As plainly told the man that she could brook No parley with him, so he turned and left. Alone again, she felt as one bereft Of outward help or hope, and doubted whether 'Twere wise to break with priest and church together; “For though they fail'd to rid me of my grief, The thought that yet they would, gave some relief; But, now I've cast them off, I see their worth, And feel the desolation of this earth.” Her eyes fell on the damp earth where she stood, And there a daisy in sweet solitude Was meekly folding to the setting sun, And all around it not another one. Its loneliness so touch'd her heart that she Let go her sorrow, and on bended knee Gazed deep into the being of the flower, And seem'd its sweet existence to devour: “Dear God, dear God, what need have I to doubt Thy far-descending care, which leaves not out Even this lowly daisy? Dear, dear, look! Within its leaves a spray-drop from the brook Gleams like a star; Thy sun that rules the day E'en stoops to glorify a drop of spray! O, nothing is too lowly for Thy light, Nor any soul unworthy in Thy sight. If this poor daisy, looking to the sky, Is dower'd with such radiance, may not I, By looking unto Thee, O God, receive The spirit, at whose touch all troubles leave? When Thou thyself didst walk this earth, God-Christ, 'Twas not the rich man, not the learned priest That got Thy benedictions, but the poor; Yea, even those that begg'd from door to door, And orphans, widows—all that were distressed; If they but kneel'd unto thee and confess'd Their sins, as I do now, they rose up pure— Lord of the lowly, thou! friend of the poor!” While thus she kneel'd, she seem'd to look right thro' This frame of earth that hides from mortal view The real world behind; and when she came Back to her common self, the glori-flame In which departed spirits, as 'tis said, And all angelic beings are array'd, Came flickering with her, as if she had been Within the unseen world behind the scene. She rose with such meek majesty and grace As though she had seen Jesus face to face, And softly to her dumb companion talk'd, Patting its neck as side by side they walk'd Along the croft into their clay-built home, Where never more the priest was known to come. SEVEN CHURCHES OF CLONMACNOISE. There's a place in the middle of Ireland called Seven Churches of Clonmacnoise— As noisy a place as ever squalled, If the Churches have each a different voice. I never was there myself, or mayhap I'd say something authentic of my own, Only, I see the place on the map, Some miles on the south side of Athlone; And it strikes me, as the name I read, That it must be a very queer place indeed. In what year of our Lord did it get such a name? When the ranting protestant sects began? Or farther back, when St. Patrick came, And fashioned the heathen on the Roman plan? And for what good reason was such a name given? Did he actually seven churches raise? Was the necromantic number seven Supposed to be all essential for praise? No; Patrick had too much equipoise To pitch the whole seven at Clonmacnoise. I rather think place and name arose Subsequent to Luther, Calvin and Knox— Three of the Pope's most terrible foes, Who broke up his fold into many flocks. Then seven of the sects, for all one knows, Had made their way to this central spot, And seven churches, we may suppose; Might then be built as well as not. Hence Clonmacnoise when the noisy seven Sang each in a different key to Heaven. THE NEGLECTED CANARY. Overhead, in the lattice high, Our little golden songster hung, Singing, piping merrily, With dulcet throat and clipping tongue; Singing from the peep of morning To the evening's closing eye; When the sun in blue was burning, Or when clouds shut out the sky; Foul or fair, morn, eve, or noon, Its little pipe was still in tune. Its breast was fill'd with fairy shells That gave sweet echo to its note, And strings of tiny silver bells Rang with the pulsings of its throat; Song all through its restless frame, Its very limbs were warbling strings; I well believe that music came E'en from the tippings of its wings; Piping early, late and long, Mad with joy, and drunk with song! O, welcome to thy little store, Thy song repays it o'er and o'er. But playful June brought holidays, And bade our city hearts prepare To leave a while our beaten ways For sandy shore and breezy air. Some busy days the needles flew, And, though no special heed it drew, Our warbler up above us there Was each one's joy—but no one's care.— The noise of preparation rang From room to room, from head to head, Until our little minstrel sang Almost unheeded, and—unfed; Singing on with trustful lay, Piping through the livelong day! But how it spared its ebbing well, Or how eked out its lessening meal, We may but guess, we cannot tell— We only think, and sadly feel. It saw the kittens on the floor Regaled with plenty from our board; It saw the crumbs swept from our door, Feeding the sparrows in the yard. Ah, were those prison wires away, And were it only free as they! We know not if its song grew weak As thirst and hunger gnaw'd apace; And when to the accustom'd place, It came its food or drink to seek, We cannot tell if bleak despair Rose in its breast when none was there! Or whether, springing to its perch, It piped again the merry strain, Alighting to renew its search— Search and sing again, again: We cannot tell, our busy brains Unconsciously drank in its strains; Nor missed at morning, noon, or night, The sweet unrecognised delight. But when our day to leave came round, “Ah! who will tend the bird?” we said. “Chirp, chirp! sweet, sweet!—Alas! no sound Of wing or note! And is it fled?” We look'd into the cage, and found Our little minstrel cold and dead! And scatter'd on its sanded floor The chaffy remnants of its store. The last drop in its well was drain'd, And not a grain of seed remain'd. We laid it in a little grave, And wonder'd how so small a thing Had ever piped the merry stave That made our hearts and household ring. Surely it was not this that sung, But something that has pass'd away— The life that ran through limb and tongue— Ay, call it spirit, if we may; Which haply in some other sphere Repeats the song that charm'd us here. For life is sacred—great and small,— And He that notes the sparrow's fall May keep a higher home for all. THE LAIRD OF BRETHERTON. The Laird of Bretherton lives in the north, Far, far up in the north countrie, Beyond the Tweed, the Clyde and the Forth, Even Beyond the Tay and the Dee; In a green sunny glen, Almost out of our ken, And a somewhat mysterious man is he. Children or wife he never knew— His only companion a big tame goose: At the jambs of the fireside sit these two— He silent and thoughtful, it silent and croose; And whether his thought Be something or nought, He's at least what the Scotch call “unco douce.” To gentle or simple he seldom speaks More than the syllable no or ay; And often his tongue lies silent for weeks, Unless when the goose gives a cackling cry: Then a guttural note Wells up in his throat, But unknown the nature of his reply. He can read, but he handles never a book; As for papers they rarely come up the glen, And never at all to his chimla nook— For what are to him the doings of men? They may love, they may hate, They may legislate,— He cares not a button how or when. A grown-up man was he when they pass'd The ten-pound bill of '32; Household suffrage has come at last, Yet his manhood seems but half gone through. The whole of the time He's been in his prime, But with their Reform had nothing to do. And the mighty battles have run their day— Alma and misty Inkermann, And the black revolt in India, Where innocent blood in torrents ran, And the gory well Remains to tell The dire success of a traitor's plan. And Solferino's terrific fray, Where lips of iron decided fates; The sharp week's war in Germany; And the grapple of death in the Western States, When the world look'd on, From Charleston To Richmond's slowly yielding gates. Great reputations have gone to the deuce, And small ones come to immortal fame; But what to Bretherton and his goose How the one class went or the other came? No requiem Ever comes to them, Or blatant sound of a living name. They sit at the fire, the goose and the laird, And he seems to be thinking hard and deep. 'Tween the goose and the fire his looks are shared; The goose sits churming half asleep; The tongues of fire Lick higher, higher, And with the smoke up the chimney leap. He seems to delight in the churming goose, And he seems to enjoy the curling reek; To the tongues that play so fast and loose, He listens, and thinks he can hear them speak: No doubt they do, And he knows too That language older than Latin or Greek. But list when the chimney begins to growl, And the winds break out in their highest key, And the glen is alive with whoop and howl, All the spirits of air in jubilee,— O then may be heard The goose and the laird Enjoying it all with a chuckling glee. Or see them on sky-blue summer days, When the laird's loved silence is all supreme, And the bee on its tiny bugle plays To deepen the glen in its noonday dream; And the sheep are still, In the shade of the hill, And the tail-tossing cows knee-deep in the stream. They leave their seats on the sleepy hearthstone, And out to the drowsier braes they come, Or, like creeping mist up the whinny loan, They slowly wander a mile from home, List'ning at times To the grasshoppers' rhymes, That spin in the grass their monotonous thrum. The laird sits down on the mossy banks, The goose goes nibbling the grass in the loan. He snuffs the whins with half-uttered thanks, Or a blue-bell peeps by the side of a stone, And he kneels to gaze, His eyes in a haze, And his thoughts—but his thoughts remain his own. Who knows but that this quiet man— To all our worldly ways so blind— Can see some farther than others can Into the world this world behind, And through the cell Of the little blue-bell, And into the very soul of the wind? And knowing all men are geese, his choice Is a goose that pretends to be nothing more. He leaves the rest to their scramble and noise, Their empty pretensions and blustering roar;— Their risings and fallings, Professions and callings, An unheard sea on an unseen shore. A CHRISTMAS CAROL. Christmas, come! and ere you go, Give us a taste of Christmas weather— Tinkling ice or silent snow, Wind and hail, or all together.— Days of drizzle, quit the scene, And let the snow-clad monarch enter: Christmas, come, and bring us Winter, Crowned with hollies, red and green. Spread upon the earth's blacken'd floor Your carpet white with gleaming spangles; Bring the robin to our door; Fringe the eaves with icy tangles; On the shrubs hang coral chains; Paint the forests in the panes; From the apple-tree or oak, Bring a bunch of mistletoe; And pass around the song and joke, Ere you go, ere you go. Pile the logs upon the hearth; Warm our hearts, and make us merry, And further to increase our mirth, Fill the cups with elderberry. Read us tales of ghostly awe Out of Extra Double Numbers, Until the fireside listeners draw Closer round the crackling embers. But, while cosily we sit, Touch our hearts, lest we forget The shivering singers in the snow; They only ask what we can spare— A little of our Christmas fare: Freely give and let them go. Take their simple benediction; And as they go onward singing, Let us hear the mingled ringing Of the joyful city bells, Chiming with their song that tells The marvel of the Crucifixion. Christmas, come! and ere you go, Lead us to the dying year; Lying there beside his bier, Conning o'er his weal and woe, And his many faults confessing. All past life feels weak we know. But let us kneel and get his blessing Ere he go, ere he go. A' BURDENS ARE LICHT, EXCEPT TO THE BEARER. Wi' handfuls o' hardships and heartfuls o' care, Guidwife, you and I ha'e a hantle to bear, We've scrimpit an' clootit to mak baith ends meet, Yet for a', there's but little between's and the street.

Guidman, we ha'e troubles and hardships enew, But we've comforts and joys neither little nor few. We gree weel thegither, our bare leggit weans Are lichtsome as linties and sturdy as stanes: Hard wark and sound sleep, a clear conscience and peace; And richly we dine when guid health says the grace. Awa' wi' your envy o' lots that look fairer— A' burdens are licht, except to the bearer. But think o' your thousands exempt frae a' toil, The heirs o' the siller, the lords o' the soil; Your limbs o' the law, wi' a scart o' the pen Each makin' as muckle's wad sair ony ten; Your parsons, whase heaviest wark is to speak, And that, too, for only ae day in the week; Your doctors, your merchants, your traders and tricksters, That live by their lees and their villainous mixtures! The last I wad envy's the rich idle crew, For the weariest labour is—naething to do; Nor wad I the lawyer, though cramm'd be his purse, Ilk penny that fills it is paid wi' a curse: The parson's hard set for his seventh day's scrieve, And aften maun preach what he canna believe: Wi' doctor and dealer, Death and Debt deal nae fairer:— A' burdens are licht, except to the bearer. Ay, ay, but to slave frae the dawn to the dark, And aften denied e'en the curse o' hard wark; Ilka day eatin' up what the ither has won, Wi' nocht to fa' back or look forrad upon; Yet plenty for a' in the lap o' the earth, To whilk we've a richt by the charter o' birth! It's hard to be borne, and wrang to defend it;— We shouldna put up wi't—plain Justice cries “mend it!” It's mended already—ay mair than we ken; The troubles o' life are the makin' o' men: Ilk ane gets his share, and what matter the kind, Be this through the body or that through the mind. Ah, mony's the licht-seemin' heart on the road, Wad part wi' its pack for your wearisome load. The mair we repeat it, the proverb grows clearer— A' burdens are licht, except to the bearer. DRUMM'D OUT. The never a trade at all had I been, But as proper a lad as could be seen, So I 'listed for to serve the Queen In the Seventy-second Regiment. But soon I tired of sodger play, And being the worse of drink one day, I cut my stick and ran away From the Seventy-second Regiment. The redcoats had me in a crack, They gave me fifty on the back, Which, being my first, was a very small whack For the Seventy-second Regiment. I tried the same game on once more, But they hauled me back, as they did before, And they doubled my punishment three times o'er, Did the Seventy-second Regiment. Of picking and stealing I had the knack, And in using my fingers I was not slack, But soon it became a well-known fac' In the Seventy-second Regiment. Desertion, drink, and thieverie, They played the hangi-ment with me, Likewise disgraced her Majestie, And the Seventy-second Regiment. They tried the Cat, on my well-tann'd skin, They tried me with prison discipline; But they saw that I did not care a pin For the Seventy-second Regiment. So the facings off my coat they tore, And turned it round with the tails before, Then marched me down to the barrack door, And kicked me out of the Regiment. They played the “Rogue's March” all the way, On a cracked old fife that would hardly play; With tootle-teetle-toot, and r-r-r-r-rummy-dummy day They drumm'd me out of the Regiment. Now the case stands thus, and thus it stands— I have no trade within my hands, And live by breaking the ten commands, Since they drumm'd me out of the Regiment. I ply my craft both night and day, I do not fear the face of clay, The devil himself, or Botany Bay, Or the Seventy-second Regiment. LONDON. To live in London was my young wood-dream— London, where all the books come from, the lode That draws into its centre from all points The bright steel of the world; where Shakspere wrote, And Eastcheap is, with all its memories Of gossip Quickly, Falstaff and Prince Hal; Where are the very stones that Milton trod, And Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith and the rest; Where even now, our Dickens builds a shrine That pilgrims thro' all time will come to see; London! whose street names breathe such home to all: Cheapside, the Strand, Fleet Street and Ludgate-hill, Each name a very story in itself. To live in London! London, the buskin'd stage Of history, the archive of the past— The heart, the centre of the living world! Wake, dreamer, to your village, and your work. THE ALBUM. A household treasury, where all that come May leave the impression of the varied mind In pencil's breathing lines, that speak, though dumb; Or words that give a picture to the blind: A casket where the gems of thought and art We gather on life's rugged way are set In lasting beauty, to renew the heart When sear'd and sadden'd with this worldly fret; A glass in which our future will behold Our present feature, and compare the two. O may the characters we now unfold Be such as bear progressive Time's review, That in these pages eyes unborn may glean A worthy glimpse of what our lives have been! SONNET. [Since, twenty years ago, you took this hand] Since, twenty years ago, you took this hand, And robed me in the mantle of your name, My raven locks are gray with time's white sand, But yet this heart, then young, remains the same. And so with you: amid your temples' snow I see no wrinkle of the aged man; For love's eyes look all inwardly, and know A deeper truth than outward vision can.— O wherefore need we ever think of age, Or mourn the lapse of time, unless to learn That life is endless, and time but a gauge Whereby we comprehend the great eterne?— Then, grow we old or young, what matter whether, So long as you and I grow on together. STRATFORD-ON-AVON. To Stratford-on-the-Avon. And we pass'd Through aisles and avenues of the princeliest trees That ever eyes beheld. None such with us Here in the bleaker north. And as we went Through Lucy's park, the red day dropt i' th' west; A crimson glow, like blood in lovers' cheeks, Spread up the soft green sky and pass'd away; The mazy twilight came down on the lawns, And all those huge trees seem'd to fall asleep; The deer went past like shadows. All the park Lay round us like a dream; and one fine thought Hung over us, and hallow'd all. Yea, he, The pride of England, glisten'd like a star, And beckon'd us to Stratford. TO JANET, With a small book, entitled, “Ears of Corn, from various Sheaves.” If cares in others may be understood By feeling what ourselves bear and have borne, Then may I judge your spirit sometimes lorn, And often craving for a higher good. How precious, then, the stores of heavenly food Bequeathed in books! And these few “Ears of corn, From various sheaves,” by various reapers shorn, May help the longings of your upward mood. For, as the body lives by nourishment, So does the spirit; and its daily bread Is truth and beauty, God's fine mystery blent Through art and nature; and the hopes that shed Perpetual morning in our way; yea, all Of joy or grief that can our day befal. MUSINGS. TO JANET, On her Forty-second Birth-Day Anniversary. It is your natal-day,—and Time has harried Some youthful dreams from both your heart and mine; Yet do we feel as young as when we carried Pea-hules for Herrit's swine. And we can still the same old pennies be— Among the lower classes or the upper— As when we sang of tuskers to our tea, And soor-dook to our supper. Though leagues of weary land and wearier brine Have parted us since then, forget we cannot; And who so fit to sing of auld langsyne As I should be to Janet? Our memories are harps—the passing winds Awake in each the notes that harmonize; An incident is mentioned—in our minds The self-same pictures rise. And far-back names beat on the chords, and draw Sweet music out, as of a distant lute:— The Murraygate, Monikie, and The Law; Or Mickie with his flute. Some touch the chords of pathos, some as soon Bring back long-buried humour to new life:— Paulina, Tibbie Neish, or Toorin Broon; The Auld Gudeman and Fife. But why revive old memories to one Whose mind's a chronicle—whose every day Is anniversary of lives begun, Or others pass'd away? Since each one's day you never fail to count, Above them all your own day shall be reckon'd; And for your sake my tartan breeks I'll mount— The gallant forty-second. If many years be much to be desired, May you outwear the tartans of the north, And ere you don the last garb, be attired In famous ninety-fourth! All life should be a heritage of bliss; And early pass from earth, or long remain; The deepest thought says life lives on from this, The first link of the chain. Then let us waste no soul on worthless ends, But largely love and live our highest truth; Be fill'd with sentiment, give heart to friends, As in our greenest youth. And walk with Nature; let her beauty move The heart to ready joyance: praise the Giver— Believing that as much as we can love, Is ours now and for ever. SOLITUDE. How sweet the yoke of chosen solitude With the allurements of the town at hand To take or leave according to the mood! How easy to withstand! We let the buskin'd stage expend its wit, The panorama of the streets go by, The orator declaim unheard, and sit At home in lonely joy. The morning columns that with breakfast come, Fill'd with the living drama of the age— Even them we can afford to leave for some Elizabethan page. But solitude afar from all that moves The wheels of history, the hearts of men, Beyond the range of life's accustomed grooves— How hard the yoke is then! We do not live, but longingly exist Upon the slow combustion of the heart, Leisure unused, the ends of being miss'd, Craving the world apart! Ah, then, the worthiest volume poorly meets Our fancied wants; we hanker after news, And lay down Shakspere for the tatter'd sheets That wrapt our last new shoes. BOOKS AND THOUGHTS. As round these well-selected shelves one looks, Remembering years of reading leisure flown, It kills all hope to think how many books He still must leave unknown. But when to thoughts, instead of books, he comes, Regret grows less for what he cannot read, If he reflects how many learned tomes One thought may supersede. So, let him be a toiling, unread man, And the idea, like an added sense, Of God informing all his life, he can With many a book dispense. The fine conviction, too, that Death, like Sleep, Wakes into higher dream—this thought will brook Denial of the libraries, and keep The key of many a book. TOO MANY BOOKS. I would that we were only readers now, And wrote no more, or in rare heats of soul Sweated out thoughts when the o'er-burden'd brow Was powerless to control. Then would all future books be small and few, And, freed of dross, the soul's refinèd gold; So should we have a chance to read the new, Yet not forego the old. But as it is, lord help us, in this flood Of daily papers, books and magazines! We scramble blind as reptiles in the mud, And know not what it means. Is it the myriad spawn of vagrant tides, Whose growth would overwhelm both sea and shore, Yet after necessary loss, provides Sufficient and no more? Is it the broadcast sowing of the seeds, And from the stones, the thorns and fertile soil, Only enough to serve the world's great needs Rewards the sower's toil? Is it all needed for the varied mind? Gives not the teeming press a book too much— Not one, but in its dense neglect shall find Some needful heart to touch? Ah, who can say that even this blade of grass No mission has—superfluous as it looks? Then wherefore feel oppressed and cry, alas, There are too many books! INCENSE OF FLOWERS. This rich abundance of the rose, its breath On which I almost think my soul could live, This sweet ambrosia, which even in death Its leaves hold on to give. Whence is it? From dank earth or scentless air? Or from the inner sanctuaries of heaven? We probe the branch, the root—no incense there— O God, whence is it given? Is it the essence of the morning dew, Or distillation of a purer sphere— The breath of the immortals coming through To us immortals here? Exquisite mystery, my heart devours The living inspiration, and I know Sweet revelations with the breath of flowers Into our beings flow. MIND'S SEASONS. Whence comes the mantling green of summer woods, To clothe the boughs that have been dead so long? And whence the thought that breaks our silent moods, And blossoms into song? I stand as leafless as the blacken'd trunk, I feel no stir of any inward breath; Of what oblivious Lethe have I drunk, To bring this barren death? Has mind its seasons, like the circling earth? Its sun that draws new being from the roots? Its periods of long waiting? winter dearth? Spring days? autumnal fruits? O God of Spring, here like a winter oak I reach to thee my bare, bleak, frozen arms, And pray for leaves, pray for the quick'ning stroke, Pray for the breath that warms. And prayer is its own return, the fire That floods the mountain tops with hope of day. The getting of the good that we desire Enables us to pray. THE MYSTERY OF THOUGHT. How is it? Does the Will our thoughts create, Or only stir the latent seeds to grow? Or do we but dispose the brain and wait The unknown inward flow? We may not tell unless by what we feel; And who shall say his thoughts can be constrain'd? Or that he did more service than reveal The thought by thinking gain'd? Earth gets her wealth of flowers and fruit and grain All from the unseen world that lies behind. Earth only is the body and the brain, The other is the mind. For though with wondrous skill we analyze Both thought and food when into being brought, The unknown something in the process flies That made them food and thought. Alas, I know not! but when in this night Of ignorance, where fancy blindly roams, I turn to the Unseen, and pray for light, I often find it comes. UNWITTING TRIBUTE. A learned critic, meaning censure, says No subject is too prosy for my muse, And thus methinks unwittingly he pays A tribute he'd refuse. Nothing too prosy! Wherefore should it be? He is no poet if in the merest clod He may not find some trace of Poesy, His all-besetting god. He cannot hide from it, do what he will; It gazes out on him from stocks and stones; The world moves by on grating wheels—he still Can hear celestial tones. The cruse that winks through some lone widow's pane; The birring sonnet of her spinning wheel, No prosier are than heaven's lurid chain, Or earth's resounding peal. The elements that chaunt in epic tongue— To them the drowsiest senses are awake: It needs a poet's ear to catch the song That breathes in things prosaic. So, as “unto the pure all things are pure,” Unto the poet all reflect his dream: He needs no spic'd event, no special lure, But finds in all a theme. LOGIC. Unless you have the logic of the schools, 'Tis said you cannot with precision think; In reasoning it gives the needed tools To hammer link by link. ‘Not so,’ says Swedenborg; and, argues he, ‘It were as necessary to advance Through certain studies in anatomy Ere you can learn to dance.’ Methinks that both are right and wrong; that he Who thinks by logic will be more exact Within his rules, but often fail to see The truth beyond the fact. While he that treads with uncondition'd sight, Though often lost within the night of thought, Will often reach that all-redeeming light The other vainly sought. UNCLASSIC. Unversed in classic lore, and all unread In the great masters of old Greece and Rome, Much of the modern is to me half dead, And wholly dead is some. Unknown the instances on which they build; The names they use, and references, unknown,— Though in good English given, to me they yield, Instead of bread, a stone. Excluded thus, what chance have I to make, From gleanings in my own unletter'd waste, Aught of commanding interest to take The literary taste! For what would all its learning serve, were it, With any recognition, to receive As critically “literatesque” and fit, The unschool'd things I weave? I must not hope to win such classic praise, But trust to lower audience; and for themes, Find them at home, along the trodden ways, In work-begotten dreams. Or if among the humbler things I find A dim, deep thought that wants the light of words, It will be such as for the unclassic mind God every day affords. And that I'll give as plainly as I may, In Saxon tongue, for Saxon eye and ear— So plainly that the classic taste will say “Pooh, pooh, there's nothing here!” BEAUTY THE FLOWERING OF VIRTUE. Beauty was by the ancients known to be The flowering of virtue; yet, in sooth, With added insight into nature, we Can barely reach that truth. But see what lovely violets of light Pure chastity within the eye imparts, And in the cheek what roses, red and white, Bloom up from gentle hearts! Be outward features wintery and hard, And virtue in the heart's core, with them bear Until some soft emotion burst the sward, Then see what beauty there! Or if you see great beauty in a face, Yet know the soul within of no esteem, Be sure there has been virtue in the race, This but its setting gleam. So, too, all work, of whatsoever soil, If into flowers of loveliness it shoot, Through trade's close bargain or artistic toil, Has virtue at the root. THE DANDELION. The daisy has its poets; all have striven Its world-wide reputation to prolong; But here's its yellow neighbour—who has given The dandelion a song? Come, little sunflower, patient in neglect, Will ne'er a one of them assert thy claim, But, passing by, contemptuously connect Thee and thy Scottish name? Whence the neglect? The daisy is as homely, Its very homeliness has been extolled: Less beautiful thou art, yet not uncomely, Thou star of shining gold! And great thy virtue; root and stem and flower Yield to the man of herbs their potent juice: Not all an outward tinsel is thy dower— It serves a deeper use. Most human-like the fortune of thy species; Some struggle hard along the dusty roads, While some upon the meads, and lawns delicious, Are blest with pure abodes. Thou art transfigured too, like the immortals; The sleep of death usurps thine earthly post; And then outcomes from thy re-opening portals, A beautiful white ghost. Familiar to the children in the meadows, They pluck the apparition frail, and blow; And by the flittings of its spectral shadows They wise conclusions know. Beautiful spirit, this thy highest being Passes away like sighs into the air: Not to be lost, although beyond our seeing, But breathing otherwhere. Thine is the efflorescence of the poet, Whose wingèd thoughts speed on to unknown parts, Take root and are, though he may never know it, The joy of thankful hearts. THOUGHT SPRINGS. If when those springs that filter through the brain Seem stopped, and all thought's ebbing cisterns low, We draw upon the little they contain, Soon, soon the springs will flow. For all around us hangs thought-laden'd air, And thro' all earth the living waters break; Believing all we seek is here and there, We need but reach and take. Defer solicitation, and the springs Soon bid their waters find another way; But drawing daily of their plenty, brings Abundance day by day. USE OF BEAUTY. To what end is it that the soul thus cleaves To beauty; that around the meanest things The semblances of higher thought it weaves, Seeking to give them wings? While lowly wants they cater, plate and jug Give nectar and ambrosia through the eyes; We needs must find, too, on footstool and rug, Fruits, flowers, clouds and skies. And what superfluous beauty in our ships, Given with such lavish heart unto the waves! We may not be without it: it equips Our cradles and our graves. So, too, with what unwearied, wasteful hand Nature provides it for us, night and day! All seasons bring it, sky and sea and land Are giving it away. And to what end? That we may be embued With life that runs beyond the earthly goal; For beauty is the everlasting food That nourishes the soul. SEEING. It needs not scholar'd training to receive Truth when it comes; it often stands aloof From that; while, simply seeing, we believe, Nor ask for any proof. For as the linkëd notes are to the ear Proof of their harmony, so truth appeals Unto an inward faculty as clear, That argues not, but feels. And when we've asked the seer for some test That this is as he says, and that is so, He has not given any, but confess'd “I cannot, yet I know.” HOPE'S ARGUMENT. We give ourselves much trouble lest to die Should be to lose this conscious life and pass Impersonally into earth and sky— Lost in the general mass. And yet it is our deepest ecstasy To pass through love into another's life— To yield this rooted self all up, and be All husband or all wife. And deeper still the joy of a rapt soul, Whose self is sunk in earth, dead as the sod, Whose will has passed into divine control, And being into God. If thus to lose self be ecstatic gain, Wherefore this trouble for the loss of breath? Ay, ay, but will the ecstasy remain An ecstasy in death? So leans the argument; the more we die To the restraining earth, the more we rise Into the rapt beatitudes that lie Hidden to mortal eyes. At last death is the severing of all Entanglement or tie that binds to earth— The cutting of the cord umbilical That frees the higher birth. THE STREET SINGERS. A threadbare workman with a wife and row Of shivering children singing in the street,— Discord that sadly fills the heart, although The thing may be a cheat. Better be cheated and let no doubt start, About the man's mock-miserable condition; Better believe his plaint than have your heart Contracted by suspicion. Give him your penny and believe him true; The ways of Providence are wisely dim; Your alms may purchase the reward for you, The punishment for him. 'Tis well to keep your charity awake, To run a thousand risks of being cozen'd, And hold your heart still open for the sake Of one among the thousand. SELF-DENIAL. In whatsoever grade of life he is That runs the risks of poverty or pelf, Great independence and great virtue his Who can deny himself. How little shall suffice his actual wants! How small the service he shall ask or need! The slights of pride he shall not feel; its taunts Hearing, he shall not heed. To what do all our grievances amount But mostly to some selfish want refused, Or petty dignity of no account, Or appetite abused. And if this self by self can be denied, These are but waves that seek to storm the rock: It slips them back into the passing tide, And never feels the shock. FACT AND FICTION. Great force is doubtless given to a story When it is known that every scene and act Of cruel sorrow or triumphant glory Was one time living fact. And so again, with all its chosen diction, Invented narrative we hold as cheap: Not fact, not fact; but is there not in fiction Reality as deep. Is not the brain-creation of the thinker As veritable as his daily strife; The pilgrim just as real as the tinker— John Bunyan's thought and life. Thought is the spirit of the body, action; Unacted thought is soul without the frame But no less fact; and they that call it fiction Are cheated with a name. AT THE CHURCH DOOR. They have been hearing how the highest name Of all the world by a poor man was borne, And judged the great ones of his day to blame, Who held that name in scorn. They have been hearing how that he himself Look'd with God's eye alike on rich and poor, And even thought the holder of the pelf Was not of heaven so sure. They have been hearing how with him, who might Have chosen from the highest in the land, Poor fishermen found favour in his sight, And welcome at his hand: And how that all he said and did on earth Went to uplift the lowly, and to make All mankind brothers, of one equal birth, For God the Father's sake. Surely, inside the Church one life had flow'd From heart to heart—one light, one hope had shone From heaven, upon one family of God, Kneeling around one throne! Yet see them at the door, where rustling Wealth Meets in a swarm of smiles and shaking hands; While Poverty shrinks out and off by stealth, Or at a distance stands. If, passing to their carriage, rich eyes dare On lowly fellow-worshipper to rest, 'Tis with the cruel patronising air That stabs the poor proud breast. Not with that perfect oneness of their Lord, Whose breath, more potent than the strongest blast, Broke down all earthly difference, ignored The very thought of caste. O impious Rich, with your unchristian arts, And this his Sabbath, this his temple door! O recreant Poor, with Christ within your hearts, To feel that you are poor. PETTY PRIDE. Your pride of dress, and ostentatious forms Of entertainment, what are they to him Who leans on Nature—in her calms and storms— Nor vainly seeks his whim? The unusurped expanse of summer sky— The immemorial whisper of the tide— The missionary breeze that wingeth by— They shame your petty pride. The mountains so majestically staid Affront your poor conceit; the seas that roll With loud acclaim of liberty upbraid Your fashion-fetter'd soul. And who that keeps high fellowship with night And all her mystery of stars, can note As worthy of a thought the pompous slight Of a superior coat? Go, go, and with your compeers give and take Usage from all sincerity exempt; But spare your pains on him in whom they wake No feeling but contempt. MASTER AND SERVANT. The master is the servant, the true slave, And Tom and Dick the masters;—endless care To think for them, to plan their work, to pave Their way and keep them there. What freemen they! From work so often done, Their hands alone might do the tasks assigned; Some labour of the muscle and the bone, But little of the mind. And even that stops with the driven nail, The placement of the stone, the served-up lime— Their only care that Time, slow as a snail, Delays the loosening chime. But for their servant-master rings no bell! He comes, he leaves, yet not their freedom knows, But drags his business, as the snail its shell, With him where'er he goes. IMAGINATION. When Reason has built up on facts all clear The highest truths its argument can teach, Imagination steps into a sphere That Reason cannot reach. And there it plucks high thoughts out of the mist, And round them throws its sunshine—thoughts that need No further proof, but unto those that wist, Are very truth indeed. And thus it is that passing through the clouds Where Reason halts, it brings from far above Those mysteries the present time avoids, And after days approve. 1861–62. The year goes out in weeds and melancholy: Sing him a requiem for his soul's release: Give him a sprig of cypress with his holly, And let him go in peace. Farewell to Sixty-One! Forget his failings, Or make them precious for our future weal; Leave with the passing shade our fruitless wailings, And on with hearts of steel. For see the brave new year the field has taken, All faithful to the hour—his soldiers we. There is no time to weep like maids forsaken, If we would faithful be. Gird us each one, and to our posts of duty— For be they great or small 'tis all the same; Obedience has in all an equal beauty, Neglect an equal shame. Then lead us on to failures or successes, We'll take with equal thanks what may befal; The heart that stands by Right thro' all confesses An equal gain in all. And while the unknown Fates are busy spinning The warp that gives our webs their varied hue, A thousand welcomes and a brave beginning We give to Sixty-two. 10TH MARCH, 1863. An ancient foe has landed on our shore, But not in victor-plume or captive-chain: With stronger fetters than were used of yore We bind the warlike Dane. Come, Denmark, come in love! The country rings From end to end, and shouts from side to side, A British welcome for the day that brings Our Albert Edward's bride. 'Tis not their royal blood, their princely name, But that they represent the brave, the free; They are the nationality, and claim The nation's bended knee. Time was when Vice and Folly, raised to thrones, Got homage. Such a time has England seen. That day is past, and Britain proudly owns A Heaven-anointed Queen. O, Prince of Wales, be happy in your choice, As she, your queenly mother was; so may Your wedded love flow with as little noise, And deepen day by day. And when the years shall call you to your own— A kingdom with its sceptre—may you bring Your father's heart and wisdom to the throne, And be indeed a king. 5TH FEBRUARY, 1868. Whence falls the gloom upon our modern Tyre— Through all her streets the cloudy brow and eye, And from her mournful ships the weeping fire Of red flags, half-mast high? A prince of her's, the eldest and the best— In moral strength the bravest of the brave— Her most revered, her pride, has gone to rest In William Rathbone's grave. Humanity, exhaustless as the sea, All honour, honesty, and judgment ripe,— Of what an English Merchant ought to be, He was the perfect type. Fifth of a name that brightens as it lives, He leaves it to his race without one stain, And to his thankful town assurance gives Of such another reign. He was the people's champion through all Their fights of progress, from his manly youth; Stern foe to error, ignorance, and thrall, His sword, unyielding Truth. The World but seldom bears a godlike son,— They come at times, to save her failing breath; But we have known, and mourn the loss of one In William Rathbone's death. Weep not for him—weep rather for the Poor, Who held a deeper interest in his wealth,— Great Charities that through his aid endure, And alms he gave by stealth. Mourn not for him—his finished acts applaud: He did not merely play, but lived his part: And now—his immortality in God, And in the human heart. LIVERPOOL. In Liverpool, the good old town, we miss The grand old relics of a reverend past— Cathedrals, shrines that pilgrims come to kiss— Walls wrinkled by the blast. Some crypt or keep, historically dear, You find, go where you will, all England through: But what have we to venerate, all here Ridiculously new. We have our Castle Street, but Castle none; Redcross Street, but its legend who can learn; Oldhall Street, too, we have, the old hall gone; Tithebarn Street, but no barn. Huge warehouses for cotton, rice, and corn, Tea and tobacco, log and other woods, Oils, tallow, hides that smell so foully foreign— Yea, all things known as goods. These we can show, but nothing to restore The spirit of old times, save here and there An ancient mansion with palatial door, In some degenerate square. Then rise the merchant princes of old days, Their silken dames; their skippers from the strand, Who brought their sea-borne riches, not always Quite free from contraband. And these their mansions, to base uses come— Harbours for fallen fair ones, drifting tars; Some, manufactories of blacking, some Tobacco and cigars. We have a church that one almost reveres— St. Nicholas, nodding by the river-side— In old times hail'd by ancient marinërs That came up with the tide. And there's St. Peter's, too, not quite so frail, Yet old enough for antiquated thoughts: Ah, many a time I lean against the rail To hear its sweet crack'd notes. For when the sun has clomb the middle sky, And wander'd down the short hour after noon, Then to the heedless world that hurries by The clock bells clink a tune. They give us “Home, Sweet Home” in plaintive key, And in its turn breaks out “The Scolding Wife,” To show that home, however sweet it be, Is yet not free from strife. But sometimes “Auld Lang Syne” comes clinking forth, And surely every listening heart is charm'd; For what are even the sorrows of the earth When, past, they are transform'd? Yet all is so ridiculously new, Except, perhaps, the river and the sky— The waters and the immemorial blue For ever sailing by. Ay they are old, but new as well as old— For old and new are just the same sky dream— One metal in a slightly different mould, The same refilter'd stream. SAILING UP THE FIRTH. Uprose the sun through opening clouds of gray, And at his touch the misty hills unveil'd, And all gave promise of a glorious day As up the Firth we sail'd. At every step he took, the upper clouds Thinn'd into gauze; the wak'ning morn look'd thro' And soon, withdrawing e'en her gauzy shrouds, Came forth in radiant blue. A rippling breeze was with us, just enough To turn the waters into crisping curls; You could not say the Firth was calm or rough— It danced in crested pearls. Along the rocky ribs of Galloway A margin of white foam crept to and fro; And up the steep cliffs rose the snowy spray, Silent to us as snow. Then into view swung Ailsa Craig's huge bulk, And rais'd an old-world rapture in the blood; Far-off it loom'd like some great stranded hulk, Left there by Noah's flood. As we approach'd, our paltry tongues were still'd, The bold sky-pictured craig stood more defined; We sail'd within a presence now that fill'd, And e'en distress'd, the mind. Round its sun-burnish'd peak the seabirds flew In idle numbers, never to be told; They wheel'd and slid across the skiey blue, Like sunbeam-specks of gold. And still we strove the mighty rock to clasp, ‘As one big grandeur,’ all unto the breast; Its greatness only mock'd our feeble grasp, And on we sail'd distress'd. Along our starboard lay the Carrick shore, And Kyle, the classic, hid in warm white haze; However hid, reveal'd for evermore To the poetic gaze: The bonnie Doon, and Cassilis Downan's green, The ‘Twa Brigs,’ flyting almost side by side, The ancient town of Ayr, and scene by scene Of Tam O'Shanter's ride. And on our left lay Arran, sharp and clear, Its Holy Isle and hidden loch behind, Within whose reaches ships for shelter steer, When storms are in the wind. But Goatfell, with the tatter'd Arran peaks, Took all our eyes, piled up so sheer and high: 'Twas Nature's easel—this her freak of freaks, Her canvas the blue sky. A sudden cloud came o'er them, and anon The Arran hills in dark-blue blackness lay; Surely not all the Highlands can put on So grim a scowl as they! They were alive with passion; we beheld Their knitting eyebrows and their gleaming eyes; But soon their dark brows lifted, and they smiled Grandly at our surprise. Then, also on our left, the Isle of Bute; So like to what a paradise should be, That all declared the name would better suit With an accented é. There Kean, the tragic, built himself a cot Beside its little lake, a sylvan scene, And thought to cast in solitude his lot: Alas, for tragic Kean! As well expect the lion to turn a hound, The eagle to forget the soaring wing; He came to Bute and solitude, but found The play was still the thing. Upon our right the Cumbraes, sister isles, Were pass'd with small remark, tho' fairy splores, And devil-builded dykes and warlock wiles Are rife about their shores. Then landward Largs, with its old battle-field, Where Alexander fought the invading Dane, And made him the last hope of conquest yield, Never to come again. But all around us Beauty infinite, And History, and Old Tradition vied Which should be minister of most delight, And preach'd from side to side: Till Greenock's noisy piers lay on our beam, And luggage dragg'd us back to common earth, And finger-pointing porters broke our dream Of sailing up the Firth. POET'S CORNER. O World, what have your Poets while they live But sorrow and the finger of the scorner? And dead, the highest honour you can give Is burial in a corner. Not so, my Poets of the popular school Disprove that mean, yet prevalent conception.— Once in an age that may be; but the rule Is proved by the exception. And so, good World, the Poet still remains To all your benefices a poor foreigner; Considered well rewarded if he gains At last rest in a corner. Here in Westminster's sanctuary, where Some two-three Kings usurp one-half the Abbey, Whole generations of the Poets share This nook so dim and shabby. So when we come to see Westminster's lions, The needy vergers of the Abbey wait us; And while we pay to see the Royal scions, We see the Poets gratis. Some in corporeal presence crowd the nook, While others, who in body are not near it, Are here as in the pages of a book— Present only in spirit. White-bearded Chaucer's here, an honour'd guest, His sword of cutting humour in its scabbard; And, sooth, he did not find such quiet rest In Southwark at the Tabard! Here's Michael Drayton in his laurell'd tomb, And Shakspere over all the host commanding; And rare Ben Jonson, who got scanty room, And so was buried standing. Spencer is here from faerie land, his eyne Filled with the glamour of some dreamy notion, Admired the more that half his “Faerie Queen” Was lost in middle ocean. Here's Prior, who was popular no doubt; And Guy, with face and cowl round as a saucer; And Dryden, who, some think, should be put out Because he murdered Chaucer. And Milton, after all his civil shocks, Is here, with look of sweet, yet strong decision— John Milton, with the soft poetic locks And supernatural vision. Beaumont, of the firm of B. and F. is here; And Cowley, metaphysical and lyric; And Addison, the elegant and clear; And Butler all satiric. Gray, of the famous Elegy, who found His churchyard in the country rather lonely, Lies with the rest in this more classic ground, Although in spirit only. And Goldsmith at the Temple, leaves his bones, Comes here with tender heart and rugged feature, And mingles through this wilderness of stones His milky human nature. And here is he that wrote the Seasons four; And so is Johnson, who discover'd “Winter,” And Garrick, too, who had poetic lore Enough to bid him enter. And Southey, who for bread wrote many a tome— Of prose and verse a progeny plethoric,— And he that sung the lays of ancient Rome— Macaulay, the historic. Campbell is here in body as in soul— He for a national song eclipsed by no land; And in whose grave the patriotic Pole Sprinkled the earth of Poland. Of other famous names we find the trace, And think of many from their non-appearance; Byron, for one, who was denied a place Through priestly interference. Now most upon their own true genius stand; A few, perhaps, on little else than quackery; But all in all, they are a glorious band, From Chaucer down to Thackeray. THE END.</field>
