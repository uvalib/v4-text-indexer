      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Worshipfull and Vertuous Gentleman, Mathew Saunders, Esquire. W.H. wisheth, with long life, a prosperous achieuement of his good desires. A Treatise of the houre of Death, the day of Iudgement, the paines of Hell, and the ioyes of Heauen. Of the houre of Death. 1 O wretched man, which louest earthlie thinges, And to this worlde hast made thyselfe a thrall, Whose shorte delightes eternall sorrow bringes, Whose sweete in shewe in trewth is bitter gall: Whose pleasures fade eare scarse they be possest, And greve him lest that most doe them detest. 2 Thou arte not suer one moment for to lyue, And att thy death thou leauest all behinde, Thy landes and goodes noe suckor then can geue, Thie pleasures past are crosses to thie minde: Thie friend the world can yeld thee noe releefe, Thy greatest ioye will proue thie greatest greefe. 3 The tyme will come when Death will thee assalte: Conceyue yt then as present for to bee, That thou in tyme maiest seeke to mend thie falte, And in thie life thine errors plainlye see: Imagen now thie corse is allmost spent, And marke thie frinds how deepelie they lament. 4 Thy wyfe dothe howle, and pearce the verie skies, Thie chilldrens teares their sorrowes doth bewraye, Thie kinesfolke morne and wepe with woefull cryes, Now thou must dye, and canst noe longer staye: Loe here the ioyes and treasures of thie hart: Thie race is ronne: from them thou must depart. 5 With paine thou dost lye, gaspinge all for breath, Past hope of life or hope of anie good, Thy present state a lyuelye forme of death, Thie hart become all cold for want of blood: Thie nosethrills ronne, and gaspinge thou dost lye, Thie lothsome sight thie frinds beginne to flie. 6 Thy voyce doth yeld a horce and hollowe sounde, Thie dyinge head doth greadie seeme to sleape, Thie sences all with horror doth abound, Thie feete doth die, and death doth vpward creepe: Thie eyes doth stand, fast sett into thine head, Thie jawes doth fall, and showe thee allmost dead. 7 What doste thou thinke, now all thie sences faile? What doste thou saye by pleasure here is wonne? How dost thou now thie passed life bewayle? How dost thou wishe thie course were new to ronne? What woldst thou doe thie endinge life to saue? What woldst thou geue for that thou canst not haue? 8 Thy bodie now must frome the soule departe, Thie lands and goods another must possesse, Thie ioyes are past on which thou setst thine harte, Thie paines to come noe creature can expresse: Loe here the fruite and gaine of all thie sinne, Thie Life must end, and Death must now beginne. 9 Thy former faultes are sett before thine eyes, And monstrous shewes which seemd before so small, To swallowe thee, Despaire in secrett lyes, And all thie sinnes with terror thee appall: With scalldinge sighes they make thee now to mone, And in thie soule with sorrowe thou dost grone. 10 Thou waylest now the pleasinge of thie will, Thie euill gott goods doth make thee so lament, Thie vaine delightes with anguishe thee doth fill, Thie wantone tricks thie conscience doth torment: Thie sweetest sinnes doth bringe thee bitter smarte, Thie heynous faultes oppresse thie dyinge harte. 11 With dreadfull feare they shake thie dolefull mynd, And bent to fight, with force they thee inclose, In worldlye helpe noe resscue thou canst finde: And standinge now amidst thie mortall foes, A thousand deathes wold seeme a lesser paine Then this estate in which thou dost remaine. 12 Noe tonge, no penn, nor creature can bewraye, Howe all thie sinnes their festred rancor showe, Howe dreadfull sightes with sorrowe thee dismaye, Howe blustringe stormes of greefe beginne to blowe: Thie ioyes are gone, which were thie God before, Thie life is done and shall returne noe more. 13 What booteth it thie lewdnes to repent, And leaue to sinne when sinne forsaketh thee? What canst thou doe when all thie force is spent? Will then our Lord with this appeased bee? Thie life thou ledst in seruice of his foe, And saruest him when life thou must forgoe. 14 Now heauen to win noe paines thou wouldst refuse, Nor spare thie goods to ease thie woefull state, Of all thie sinnes thou dost thie selfe accuse, And call for grace when callinge comes to late: For sinne thou didest while life and power did last, And leauest now, when force to sinne is past. 15 Then had I wist, with sorrowe thou dost saie, But after witts repentance euer breed, The daye is come, thie debt thou now must paie, And yeld to death, when life thou most shalt neede: Thie breath is stopt in twinclinge of an eye, Thie bodie dead in vglie forme doth lye. 16 Thye carcasse now like carrion menn doth shonne, Thie frends doe hast thie buryall to procuer, Thie saruaunts seeke from thee awaye to ronne, Thie lothsome stench noe creature can induer: And they which tooke in thee their most delight, Doe hate thee most, and most abhorre thie sight. 17 Thye flesh shall serue for maggotts for a praye, For pamperinge which both sea and land was sought, Thie bodie must tranceformed be to claye, For whose delight suche costlie clothes were bought: Thie pryde in dust, thie glorie in the graue, Thie flesh in earth their endinge now shall haue. 18 Behold! the place in which thou dost abyde Is lothsome, darke, vnsweete, and verie straite: With rotten bones besett on euerye syde, And crawlinge wormes to feede on thee doth waite: Oh harde exchange! O vile and hatefull place! Where earth and fillth thie carcase must imbrace. 19 O wretched state! O most vnhappie man! Yet were yt well yf nothing were behinde, Yf all myght end as here yt first begann, Some comfort were suche endinge for to finde: For then as God of nothinge thee did frame, By course againe thou shouldst become the same. 20 But lyue thou must a thousand deathes to die, And dyinge still, yet neuer whollie dead, Thou must appere before the Judge on hie, And haue reward as thou thie life hast ledd: Thie tyme is come, thou canst no longer stay, The iudge is sett, and botelesse is delaye. Of the day of Judgement. 21 Behoulde his power. Loe whom thou didst offend For vaine delights, which were but mere deceipt, Behould on him how Anngells doth attend, And all that court doe for his comminge waight: Behould his throne of glorie in the skies, And see how wrath doth sparkell from his eies. 22 Loe this is hee whoe euerie thing did make, Whom Heauen and Earth doe prayse both night and daye, Loe here the looke att which the Anngells quake, Loe here the Lord whom all thinges doth obaye: His will is lawe, and maye not be withstand, His wrath consumes and killeth out of hand. 23 O filthie soule, how maye this wrath be borne? Or can a worme his furie now abyde? The Anngells laugh thy fillthines to skorne: They hate thie sinne, and thee for swellinge pryde: They shine with beames fare brightter then the Sonne, And call on God that Justice may be done. 24 Each creature cryes that punisht thou mayst bee, Whom in thie lyfe thou lewdlye didst abuse: Both Heauen and earth are fooes protest to thee, And all thie thoughtes of sinne doth thee accuse: Thie wordes and deedes against thee now are brought, And all thie filth which sinne in thee hath wrought. 25 Thou syted arte a just account to showe, How farre thou sought thie selfe for to deny, How all thie landes and welth thou didst bestowe, And with thie goodes thie brothers wante supplye: What care thou hadst thie makers name to prayse, What paine thou tokst to walk in all his wayes. 26 The Judge dothe aske how all thie life was spent, Yf from offence thie sences thou didst keepe, Yf in thie soule thou truelye didst repent, And for thie sinne with hartie sorrowe weepe: Yf thou his feare didst sett before thine eyes, And for his loue all worldlie ioyes despise. 27 Yf eke thie foes reuenge thou haste not wrought, Yf to thie frindes thou neuer wert vnkinde, Yf earthlie pompe thou euer sett att nought, Yf secrett hate thou haste not kept in mynde: Yf thou alike didst ioye and sorrowe take, And with thie harte all carnall lust forsake. 28 Thye thoughtes and wordes the Judge dothe open laye, And asketh now a strayte account of all, How thou didst here his motions obaye, And for his grace with erenest fervor call: Yf all thie lyfe on earth thou ledst vpright, And in his loue didst sett thie whole delight. 29 What canst thou plead thie lewdnes to excuse, When truth shall proue in all thou didst offend? The Judge is just, thou mayst not him refuse, Thie cause is naught, thou canst not it defend: To hope for helpe, alas! it is in vaine, The tyme is paste, noe helpe thou canst obtaine. 30 Our Lord doth saye, “how couldst thou use me soe, Sith I to thee both soule and bodie gaue? How durst thou seeke and serue my mortall fooe, Sithe I did dye thie selfe from death to saue? I gaue thee all, and me thou didst detest, He gaue thee naught, yet wholie thee posest. 31 “Thye lands and life did from my goodnes flowe, Thy fleshe and bones I did of nothinge frame, Both wellth and witt I did on thee bestowe, And gaue thee all to prayse my holie name: Yett with them all against mee thou didst fight, And fledd to them whoe bredd mee greatest spight. 32 “When I did speake thou seemedst deafe and dombe, When he did call thou madst him aunswere strayte, He neuer stayd but thou didst quickly come, And I without inforsed was to wayte: O thankelesse wretche thou mee shalt see noe more, But dwell with him whoe had thie harte before. 33 “Thou shalt with him for euer more remayne, To whome thie selfe for pleasure thou haste soulde, His will thou wroughst, and myne thou didst disdaine, His right thou arte, I can not thee withoulde: Thie owne deserts haue made thee his to bee, The choyse was thine, noe wronge is donne to thee.” 34 Then comes the Devill, and to our Lord doth saye, “O righteouss Judge, this wretche I ought to haue, For in his lyfe he would not thee obaye, But with his harte to mee him selfe he gaue: My precepts eke he practist daye and night, And mee to please he made his whole delight. 35 “Him selfe he vowed to serue me all his dayes, His eyes were fixt vppon my counsell still, His feete were bent to walke in all my wayes, His harte was sett for to performe my will: His life and landes I drue him on to spend, In doeinge that which might thee most offend. 36 “Hee scornd thie power and quyte refusde thie grace, Thie bitter paynes hee bannisht from his eyes, Thie precious bloud hee never would imbrace, Thie gracious woundes he lewdlie did despise: Thie threats for sinne he reckoned as a iest, Thie wordes and will in all he did detest. 37 “Thie glorious death hee seemed to disdaine, And followed that in which hee did delight, For servinge thee he toke not anie paine, But all thie love with hate he did requite: What reason then thie glorie he should see, Of which he seemde so carelesse for to bee. 38 “Thou didst him make, and on him all bestowe, I nothinge gaue nor him to beinge brought, Yet thee he left, to whom he loue did owe, And mee hee sarvd, whoe never gave him ought: What woldst thou more thou vsest not to wronge, And hee to mee in Justice doth belonge. 39 Behoulde, O soule! how God doth thee refuse, And how his foe doth clayme thee as his owne, Thie conscience doth with horror thee accuse, And reape thou must as thou before hast sowne: The Lord of Lords doth thee condemne to lye In endlesse flames where livinge thou shalt dye. 40 O wretched soule! what shall become of thee? What greater paine can any harte devise? Yett worse their is, if worse their yett maye bee, Thie bodie must to Judgment shortlie rise: And bothe alike in Hell must suffer smarte, As both in earth in sinne had equall parte. 41 All sinners faine would shonne this dreadfull daye, And wishe yt were without their perill past, The feare alone must needs their hartes dismaye, The signes appeare and on yt cometh fast: Behold the Sonn is darke which shined bright, The stares doe fall, the moone hathe lost her light. 42 Behould how men are witherede quite with woe, And cannot find a harbowre now of rest: Behould on earth how senclesse they doe goe, Theire faces palle, theire harts with feare opprest: Behould each where how beasts for terrour cry, And marke how men alredy seeme to dye. 43 Behoulde how blodd the trees and braunches sweate, And howe each thinge in trembblinge wise doth quake, Behoulde the Sea against the Land doth beate, And roringe lowde doth force the Earth to shake: Her surges mounte, her swellinge furie showes, And on the Land her fishe with rage shee throwes. 44 The clowdes like smoake doe thicken in the skies, The mountaines move, the Earth doth open wide, The blustringe windes with stormes and tempests rise The stowttest hartes their faces seeke to hide: Both ritch and poore from citties now are fledd, And all in caves doe ronne to shrowde their head. 45 Eche lyvinge thinge for helpe doth crye and call, And savage beastes vnto the Cittie flie, The earth doth quake, the strongest towers fall, And beastes remaine were menn did vse to lie: The course begins of nature heire to faile, The Heauens doth mourne and all thinges els doth wayle. 46 The Anngells lowd their Trumpets dreadfull sound, And summones all that ever lyfe posest, The Earth with woe and terror doth abound, The dead aryse that longe had bene at rest: Bothe quicke and dead assembled round doe stand, And wayte his will whose comminge is at hand. 47 Behoulde how lowe both Heaven and earth doe bowe, And prostrate all his favor to desyre, Behould howe Christ in glorie cometh now, And in the ayre appeares a flame of fyer: The Earth for feare doe tremble att this sight, The sea is dryed, the hills are molten quight. 48 The hardest rockes are turned into dust, His furious wrath noe creature can abyde, Their paines were sweete which now are proved just, And neede not seeke in corners them to hyde: Our Lord rewardes as merytt hee doth finde, Thrise happie they that beare a giltles minde. 49 O cursed soule! how art thou drownd in care, When all this sight is sett before thine eyes: Thy passinge feare noe wrytinge can declare, Thie bodie darke like Deathe doe seme to ryse: Thie hope is past for easinge of thie smarte, Thie sinnes are prickes to wound thie dyinge harte. 50 Behould how thou noe favor here canst gett, Nor from thie foes by anie meanes escape: Thie right hand is with all thie sinnes besett, Beneath thee Hell to swallowe thee doe gape: The fearefull fends vppon thie left hand frowne, And lye in wayte, to throwe thee hedlonge downe. 51 Above thee sytts the Judge all fild with rage, Whom in thie life thou lewdlie didst offend, Noe helpe thou hast his furie to asswage, His browes hee doth with anger fercelie bend: And all the sinnes of menn hee doth repeate, Which forceth now his furie to be greate. 52 Within thee gnawes thie conscience voyde of grace, And all the evill to which thou didst consent, Without thee stands thie frinds which wayle thie cace, And doe thie state with bitter grefe lament; On euerie syde the world doth thee affright, Whose terror showes, with flames that burneth bright. 53 If forward now thou tookest on thie waye, Thou hedlonge dost vnto thie ruine run, The devills doe watche thie goinge backe to staye, Noe meanes is left misfortune for to shun: What wilt thou doe, invirond thus with woe? For neyther back nor forward thou canst goe. 54 O wretched man! how heauie is thie harte, How dost thou wish for that which can not bee, How dost thou sigh and quake in euerie parte, And must thie frinds be severd thus from thee: They fild with ioye in glorie now shall raigne, And full of greife thou torment must sustaine. 55 The Judges wordes are like a burninge fyer, Which wasteth all it commeth to imbrace, It booteth not his mercie to requyer, The time is past of callinge now for grace: Behould the Judge doth thee condemne to hell, Wher thou in paine for sinne shalt ever dwell. 56 O dolefull wordes! O most vnhappie wight! Thie head to shrowd for mountaines thou dost call, Thie future paines are present in thie sight, And cursest now the cawses of thie fall: Thie birth and life to late thou dost repent, Yet waylest both and dost in vaine lament. Of the paines of Hell. 57 What tonge, what penn, what creature can expresse Those deadlie greifes which allwayes thou dost tast? The longer tyme the comfort is the lesse, Thie hope decayes, thie sorrowes never wast. O bitter sweete that earthlie pleasures breede! Thie livinge death all torments doth exceede. 58 Thye wanton eies those hellish monsters see, Whose blodie mindes thie ruine did conspire, Whose neesinge seme like lightning for to bee, Whose monstrous mouthes doe cast out flames of fire: Whose nosethrills smoake, whose eies are glowing redd, Whose whole delight by others smarte is bredd. 59 Thye wretched eares, which harkened vnto lyes, Doe here howe fends doe rage with all despight, Noe noyse is their but shreekes and hideous cryes, Which able are the stoutest hart to fright: Wher some blaspheme, and some their states bewayle, Where others curse and never cease to rayle. 60 Thye daintie nose, which had perfumes ech daye, A lothsome stenche for ever must abyde, Which riseth vpp from dampned bodies aye, That heaped their doe lye on euerie syde: Loe here the sweete thie smellinge to content, Noe worldlie filth can yeld so fowle a sent. 61 Thye curyous tast doth hunger their sustaine, Which did in meates such rare devises crave, With burninge thirst thou suffrest grevous paine, And yt to coole noe water thou canst haue: Noe dropp is their, thie thirstinge for to ease, Noe hope of helpe that maye thie grefe appease. 62 Thye feelinge yett the greatest paine doth beare: With fierie flames which all thie partes torment, An extreame cowld thou allso findest their, With gnashing teeth that makes thee to lament: Thie teares with heat in streames are daylie shedd, Thie teeth for cowld doe chatter in thie hedd. 63 If for a while noe creature can endure In earthly fiere one member for to bee, What torments doe thy passed Joyes procure, In endlesse flames thy members all to see! What greefe, what paine, what sorrowes doe they breed, Which earthly flames in all doe farre exceede! 64 The deiuills with flouts doe lough the now to scorne, Thy flesh and bones in sunder they doe teare, Thy cursed skinne with cruell whipes is worne, Thy woefull harte is filled full with feare: With inwarde woe thy soule is sore oppreste, With outward paine thy body finds no reste. 65 Thy torments strange doe breede thee bitter greefe, And reste in thine Imagination still, Thyne owne conceipte which now should yeld releefe, Doth labour more with sorrow thee to fill: Thou thinkest most what most thou whouldst eschew, Thy griefe thy thoughts, and thoughts thy griefe renew. 66 Thy memory doth call vnto thy mynde The shorte delight of all thy pleasures past, Yt wounds thy harte these paines for them to finde, Which greueous are and shall for euer last: Thy desperate case no comfort can obtaine, Thy passed Joyes encrease thy pres?t paine. 67 Thine vnderstandinge doth thy misery shew, And telleth thee thou arte in Sathans Jawes, For shorte delights, thy losse yt makes thee know, And in thy soule the worme of Conscience gnawes: Those fadinge Joyes in rage thou dost defye, And in dispight they make thee thus to crye. 68 “My former Joy a shadow was in deede, It did not last, but passed quicke away, My present paine all measure doth exceede, Noe witt nor arte my torments can bewray: A time there was when blisse I might haue woone, But time is past, and all my course is runne. 69 “O cursed time, in which I time forsooke, A litle paine had ridd me of my woe! O cursed Joyes in which I pleasure tooke, For pleasinge you all pleasures I forgoe! And here in hell each kinde of paine I finde, Which wasts my fleash and wounds my woefull mynde. 70 “Yf I my sinnes with sorrowe had confest, They had to me bene clene remitted all: In stead of greefe, I glorie had possest, If I for grace had bent my minde to call: O wretched wretch, that for so small a paine, Refusinge blisse, in torment must remaine. 71 “The greatest ioyes which doe in earth abound Can in a world not yeld so much delight As here by paine is in a moment found, Whose blasinge woe is present still in sight: What fancie then bewitched my wretched harte, For fained Joyes to suffer endlesse smarte. 72 “My parents were the cawsers of my woe, And all the meate on which I euer fedd, My carnall frind hath proued my greatest foe, And vnto mee this mischefe now hath bredd: Accuse mee all that hathe my ruine wrought, And euerie meane which mee to beinge brought. 73 “Thrise happie they on earthe that never were! Their state is blest that never came to liue! O blessed wombes that chilldren never bare! O happie brest which suck did never geve! O deadlie paine! O most unhappie place! O cursed wretch whome ill mishapps imbrace!” 74 Loe here the plaints in this infernall lake, Wher Scorpions stinge and squorges thee torment, Wher hammers beate, and Devils a roringe make, Wher hope is past and dampned soules lament: Wher wormes doe crawle and uglie serpents creepe, Wher paines abound, and sorrowes make thee weepe. 75 Against our Lord thou raiest with despight, And him thou dost with raginge words defie, Thou barred art from seeinge anie light, And while ye liue thou must for ever die: Loe here the fruite which worldlie pleasures bringe, Thie paines agree in measure with thie sinne. 76 Thye sweet delights are come to woe and wrack, Thie happie state unto a wretched case, Thie gredie minde is punnisht here with lack, Thie lecherous armes doe uglie fends imbrace: Thie envious sowle doth howle for deadlie paine, Thie haughtie harte doth suffer depe disdaine. 77 Thou findest smart in stead of pleasaunt games, Thie daintie wynes are turnd to bitter gall, Thie costlie clothes are now made burning flames, Thie loftie pride hath now a lothsome fall: Thou nothinge dost which maye afford thee ease, But feelest all which maye thee most displease. 78 Yet cheiflie one which farre doth all exceade, And as it is none rightlie can esteme, It greves thee most and makes thie harte to bleed, And joynd with it the other nothinge seeme: Then judge what paine this torture brings to thee, When matche to it all nothinge semes to bee. 79 Thye scences feele for everie sinne a paine, So rated their as here thou tokst delight, And now for that our Lord doth thee disdaine, Thou bannisht art for ever from his sight: The paine of scence small torment thou dost finde, When thou this losse dost call unto thie minde. 80 A grevious losse which cannot be exprest! O cause of greife and springe of deadlie woe, The Soule hath lost the center of her rest, Thie hope, thie helpe, thie life thou must forgoe: Noe paine or losse with this maye be comparde, It passeth all and cannot be declared. 81 From hope of joye this is an endlesse barr, And greatest plague that God on sinn bestowes: Compard with this thy tortures pleasaunt are, And all thie losse an easie burthen showes: Thie bittrest paines are trifles in thine eyes, Thie burninge flames thou seemest to despise. 82 What woe, what smarte, what paine can be exprest, Which wayteth now on thee for to be layde! With swordes of greefe thie harte is daylye prest, With dreadfull feare thie scences are dismayde: Thie eie hath lost what most she did desire, Thie bodie burnes in flames of endlesse fire. 83 And yf thie paines an endinge might obtaine, When yeres their were of manie thousandes runn, As on the earthe have lightten dropps of rayne, Since first of all this wretched world begunn: Some helpe this hope might bringe unto thie minde, When hope were left an end at last to finde. 84 But of them all noe ease nor end thou hast, Within thie soule some comforte might procure: Noe tyme will helpe thie sorrowes for to waste, While God is God thie torture shall indure: Thie paine in truth is more then can be tould, The sight in thought noe creature can unfould. 85 O dyinge lyfe! O sea of endlesse smarte! Which nature hates and all thinges ellse detest, O lyvinge death, noe life or death thou arte, For death hath end and life hathe sometyme rest: The worst of both our Lord hath put in thee That neyther rest nor end might other bee. 86 O dampned soule! howe dost thou roare and crye! What deadlie greefes thee daylie doe oppresse! But lyst a whyle thie cursed eies on hye, And see what ioyes the blessed their possesse: That by the sight, thie torments maye increase, And for thie losse thie sorrowes neuer cease. Of the ioyes of Heauen. 87 And first behould the beawtie of the place, Wher all the Saintes with Christ in glorie raigne, Wher honor is not mixed with disgrace, Wher ioye is free from task of anie paine: Wher great rewards attend on good desarts, And all delightes posesseth faithfull harts. 88 O wicked wretche! This cittie now behould, Which doth surppasse the reache of anie thought, The gates are pearle, the streetes are fynest gould, With precious stones the walles are wholie wrought: Of Sunn and Moone it needeth not the light, For ever their the Lambe is shining bright. 89 And from His seate a christall river flowes, Wher life doth runn, and pleasures ever springes: On everye syde a tree of comforte growes, Which savinge helthe to everie nation bringes: It worketh rest, and stinteth worldlie stryfe, It flieth death, and bringeth endlesse life. 90 This goodlie place all beawtie doth surmount, And all this world in largenesse passeth farr: The earth it selfe in bignes in account Not equall is unto the smallest starr: O worthie place whose glorie doth excell! Thrise happie they that their attaines to dwell! 91 Noe Sainte their is but brighter seemes to bee Then Sunn or moone whose beawties wonders breede: What glorie then so manie Saintes to see, Which all the starrs in number farr excede! All glorious their wher glorie doth abound, O blessed state wher blisse is ever found! 92 Archangells are but undersarvaunts there, And Anngells doe their makers will obaye, The powers in ioye with triumpth doe appere, The beawties shine, the thrones their beames displaye: The Cherubins doe yeld a famous light, The Seraphins with love are burninge shininge bright. 93 Here Patriarkes haue their ioye for all their paine, The Prophets eke with endlesse glorie blest, The Martirs doe a worthie crowne obtaine, The Virgins finde a hauen of happie rest: To all their ioyes in glorie they are mett, And now posesse what longe they sought to gett. 94 Those sacred Saintes remaine in perfect peace, Which Christ confest and walked in his wayes, They swim in blisse which now shall never ceace, And singinge all, his name for ever prayse: Before his throne in white they daylie stand, And carrie palmes of triumpth in their handes. 95 The Angells then are next in their degree, Whose order is in number to be nyne, Noe harte can think what ioye it is to see Howe all those troupes with lampes in glorie shine: The ioye is more then wrytinge can expresse: O happie eies that maye these ioyes posesse! 96 Above them all the Viregin hath a place, Which cawsd the world with comfort to abound: The beames doe shine in her unspotted face, And with the starres her head is richlye crownd: In glory shee all creatures passeth farr: The moone her shooes, the sunn her garments are. 97 O Queene of Heauen! o pure and glorious sight! Most blessed thou above all womenn arte! This cittie druncke thou makest with delight, And with thie beames reioysest everie harte: Our blisse was lost and yt thou didst restore, The Anngells all and menn doe thee adore. 98 Loe! here the looke which Anngells doe admire! Loe! here the springe from whom all goodnes flowes! Loe! here the sight that menn and Saintes desire! Loe! here the stalks on which our comfort growes! Loe this is shee whom heaven and earth imbrace, Whom God did choose and filled full of grace. 99 And next to her, but in a higher throne, Our Saviour in his manhode sitteth here: From whom proceedes all perfect ioye alone, And in whose face all glorie doth appere: The Saintes delight conceyved cannot bee, When they a man the Lord of Anngells see. 100 They ravished are with ioye in seeinge this, How Christ our Lord the highest place obtaines: They now behould the seate of endlesse blisse, And ioye to marke how hee in triumpth raynes: What ioye to menn moreover can befall Then here to see a man the Lord of all? 101 More ioye yt yeldes then anie can devise, A greater blisse then may in words be tould, His persinge beames doth dazell all their eies, His brightnes scharce his Anngells can behould: The Saintes in him their wished comfort finds, And now inioye what most content their minds. 102 To thinke on this yt passeth humaine witt: The more we thinke the lesse we come to knowe: He dothe uppon his Fathers right hand sitt, And all ye Saintes their humble sarvice showe: His sight to them doth endlesse comfort bringe, And they to him all prayses euer singe. 103 O worthie place, wher suche a Lord is cheife! O glorious Lord, which princelye sarvaunts keepes! O happie Saintes, which never tast of greife! O blessed state, wher malice ever sleepes! Noe one is here of base or meane degree, But all are knowne the sonns of God to bee. 104 What higher place can anye prince attaine, Then sonne to him which ruleth all above? Yet is their state not subiect to disdaine, But in their mindes like brethren they doe love: Noe place is left for anie hate, or feare, But here they all one harte and soule doe beare. 105 O happie place, wher discord never fights! The ioyes of all are found in everie brest, For ech as much in others ioye delights, As if alone it in him selfe did rest: In all their ioyes noe difference is their knowne, For ech accounts them all to be his owne. 106 And those they tast wherwith their Lord abounds: As parte of theirs his glorie doe they take, Unto them selues by union it redownds, And all his ioyes their glorie perfect make: So faste are knitt the members to the head, As over them his ioyes are whollie spredd. 107 What ioye is best which here they doe not finde? What greater blisse, what pleasure maye be more? What can by us conceyved be in minde Which hath not bene recited here before? Yet one delight behinde as yet remaines, Which all in all, and all in it containes. 108 They face to face doe God Almightie see! And all in him as in a perfect glasse: Noe good their is, but their is found to bee, And all delightes this vision doth surpasse. Ech sight doth yeld the hart her perfect rest, Because noe good without him is possest. 109 Hee present, past, and future thinges doth shewe, And theirfore rests their understandinge here: Their nothinge is but they in him doe knowe, And to their eies all plainlye doth appere: They now obteyne what longe they sought to gett, And all their thoughtes are on him wholie sett. 110 Their will doth last in lovinge of his sight, In which consists all good that cann be thought, Shee here hathe fixt her love and whole delight, And never will from lovinge this be brought: For here all good and goodnes doth abound, And never can without this good be found. 111 Their whole desire from hence doth never parte, But setled here for ever doth abyde: This sight doth fill the mouth of everie harte, And nothing leaves for them to wishe besyde: Without desire, content shee still remaines, And her desire with full delight obtaines. 112 Their Faith behouldes her best beloved guest, And her beleefe this sight doth here fullfill: Their constante Hope her hope hath now posest, And him inioyes for whom shee hoped still: Their Charitie, not perfect full before, To perfect state this vision doth restore. 113 O glorious sight! O some of endlesse blisse! Which never wanes, nor seemeth for to waste: Whoe ever sawe soe fayer a sight as this, Whoe ever did suche heapes of comfort taste? What can be thought that can not here be hadd? Where all doe ioye, and none are euer sadd. 114 They here possesse what maye content them most, And nothinge wante that perfect blisse maye bringe: With all delight here breathes the Holye Ghost, Which allwayes makes a freshe and endlesse springe: Noe daye is here, noe morninge, noone, nor night, But ever one and allwayes shininge bright. 115 O blessed ioyes, which all the soules posesse! O happie fruite, that vertue here hath wonne! And in degrees the bodies finde noe lesse, But shine with beames farr brighter then the sunn: Not subiect now to sicknes, greife, or paine, But glorious all, immortall they remaine. 116 And propper ioyes ech sence in private fyndes: Their eyes behould that passinge glorious sight, Wher nothinge wantes for to content their mindes, And all thinges elce which maye them most delight: Their eares are fedd with hearinge of sweete soundes, And them to please all musick here aboundes. 117 From songes of praise the Saintes noe moment spare: Noe teares are seene nor anie their doe weepe: But in this place the musick is so rare As halfe a sound would bringe all hartes a sleepe: And everie sence a propper pleasure takes, Which ioynd in one, their glorie perfect makes. 118 Noe eie hath seene what ioyes the Saintes obtaine, Nor eare hath hard what comforts are posest: Noe harte can thinke in what delight they raigne, Nor penn expresse their happie porte of rest, Wher pleasure flowes, and greife is never sene, Wher good abounds, and ill is bannisht cleane. 119 And of those ioyes noe creature end shall see: The longer tyme the sweeter they doe showe: While God indures they can not ended bee, And never waste, but allwayse seeme to growe: When worldes are worne, and millions manie paste, They now begin and shall for ever last. 120 O state of ioye, wher endlesse ioye remaines! O haven of blisse, wher none doth suffer wrack! O happie howse, which all delight containes! O blessed state, which never feeleth lack! O goodlie tree, which fruite dothe ever beare! O quyett state, which dannger neede not feare! 121 O mixture pure, which basest drosse refynes! O pleasaunte place, which onlie comforte bringes! O ioyefull sunn, wher glorie ever shines! O fruitfull soyle, wher pleasure ever springes! O glorious soules! O bodies wholie blest! O sea of good, and of all good the best! 122 O dampned wretch! the thought of this alone Oppresseth thee with heapes of deadlie care, And sighinge now in speritt thou dost grone, When with their blisse thie woe thou dost compare: Thie greevous losse dothe greive thie wretched harte, And yt with greefe redoubles all thie smarte. 123 If all the world by conquest thou hadst wonne, A trifle now thou thinkest all to geve, That on the earth thie race were new to runn, And thou againe wert suffered here to lyve: Another course thou wouldst resolve to take, And sarvinge God thie carnall will forsake. 124 The straightest life thou woldst noe paine esteme, Thie prayinge wold a passinge ioye appere, Thie fastinge ofte noe troble then would seme, Nor anie greife the hardest penaunce here: A ioye thou woldst account the sharpest paine, To scape from Hell and endlesse blisse obtaine. 125 Now must I call, O worldlie man! to thee, The end wher first I did begin to wrighte, That all these ioyes and paines which thou dost see May move thie minde to leade thie lyfe upright: Thie harte will melt to thinke uppon thie case, If their be left but halfe a sparke of grase. 126 Thou findest here what thou wilt wishe att last, And that account which none can ever shunn: Then frame thie life before thie tyme be past, As thou wilt wishe that thou in tyme hadst donne: Lest thou in vaine dost waile thie wretched state, When tyme is past and waylinge comes too late.</field>
