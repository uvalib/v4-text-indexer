      <field name="fulltext">LIFE AND HEROICK ACTIONS OF THE RENOUN'D Sir William Wallace, GENERAL and GOVERNOUR OF SCOTLAND. To the High, Puissant, and most noble Prince, JAMES, Duke of HAMILTON, CHASTLE RAULT, and BRANDON, Marquis of CLIDSDALE, Earl of ARRAN, LANERK and CAMBRIDGE, Lord AVEN, POLMONT, MACHANSHIRE and INNERDALE, Barron of DUTTON. The First BOOK OF Sir William Wallace CHAP. I. Of our Ancestors brave true, Ancient Scots, Whose glorious Scutcheons, knew no Bars, nor Blots: But Blood untainted circled ev'ry Vein, And ev'ry Thing ignoble did disdain; Of such Illustrious Patriots, and bold, Who stoutly did maintain our Rights of Old, Who their malicious, and inveterate Foes, With Sword in Hand, did gallantly oppose; And in their own, and Nations just Defence, Did briskly check the frequent Insolence Of haughty Neighbours, Enemies profest, Picts, Danes, and Saxons, Scotland's very Pest: Of such I say, I'll brag and vaunt so long As I have Pow'r to use my Pen or Tongue; And sound their Praises, in such modern Strain, As suiteth best a Scots Poetick Vein. First, Here I honour in Particular, Sir William Wallace, much renown'd in War: Who's bold Progenitors have long Time stood, Of honourable, and true Scotish Blood; And in first Rank of Ancient Barrons go, Old Knights of Craigy, Barronets also; Which gallant Race, to make my Story brief, Sir Thomas Wallace represents as Chief. So much for the brave Wallace Father-side, Nor will I here his Mother's Kindred hide. She was a Lady most compleat and bright, The Daughter of that honourable Knight, Sir Rannald Crawford, high Sheriff of Air, Who fondly doted on this charming Fair. Soon wedded was the lovely blooming she, To Malcom Wallace, then of Ellerslie: Which am'rous Pair transported with Delight, Begot young Malcom that same joyful Night: Then William; who by true Consent of all, Was honour'd to be Scotish General: And to the Nation's universal Joy, At Forrest Church, made Baliol's Viceroy. Who's martial Courage, with his Conduct wise, From English Thraldom rescu'd Scotland thrice, And did preserve the old Imperial Crown, To his immortal Glory, and Renown. 'Twas then, that, to the Terror of his Foes, Our Thistle, did drive Home the insulting Rose. But here I must beg leave to bid adieu To good Sir William, for some Minutes few, Till, like a just, impartial, honest Man, As I have heard, tell how the Wars began. King Alexander, at Kinghorn in Fife, There, from his Horse did lose his Royal Life, Thro' which arose a grievous sore Debate, Some Years thereafter, who should Rule the State David our Prince, Earl of Huntingtoun Three Daughters had; whom search all Britain round, Thro' all its Corners, and its different Airts, None more excell'd in bright, and princely Parts. Bruce, Baliol, Hasting from those Ladies spring; The Bruce and Baliol strive who shall be King. Nor did the Dispute end, but grew so hot, The Candidats in two strong Factions got. Which at that Time appear'd to be so equal, Few could foresee, or guess well at the Sequel; Here lay the great Distress and Misery, The Case at Home could not determin'd be; Wherefore, to void a bloody Civil War, The Scotish States esteem'd it better far, The two Contendants should submit the Thing, To the Decision of the English King. Who greedily the Ref'rence did Embrace, But play'd his Cards with a dissembling Face: Yea, so politick was this crafty King, For his Self-ends, Things so about to bring, That, Agents he did secretly imploy, The Scotish Lords with cunning to decoy To his ow'n Measures; a pernicious Plot Quite opposite unto the Trust he got; Thinking to make, (so big his Hopes were grown) The Scotish Crown pay Homage to his own. Which with one Voice, flatly the States refuse, In spite of all Politicks he could use. The Bishop there of Glasgow, sitting by, Said Sir excuse us, for we do deny, Any ov'r Lord, but the great God above To whom we'll Homage pay, or Subject prove. Then to the Bruce, the Treason was propos'd Which was by him most gen'rously oppos'd, Believe me Sir said he, I'll hang as soon, As I'll Resign our independent Crown. Therefore leave off, your Words are all in vain, Such Treachery, true Honour does disdain. Unto the Baliol next he did apply, Who did consent, Alas too hastily To hold the Crown of Edward, contrair Right, For which he was created King on sight: O base Decision! Shall the Guise thus go! Shall Ancient Scotland hold of England? No. On such base Terms, both make a scurvy Step, Edward to grant, and Baliol to accept, A Thing, which is for certain known and sure, Was never yet in either of their Pow'r: Neither could be, without the firm Assent, Of the Estates of Scotish Parliament. Since the Scots Crown, our Kings so long had wore, Was to be Independent as before. An English Parliament within short Space Is call'd, where Baliol suffred great Disgrace, At which Affront was so exceeding wroth, He quickly broke his base unlawful Oath: Repented sore, and curs'd the fatal Hour, Wherein he swore, what was not in his Pow'r. Which was much better, as Divines exhort, Than to continue, and be Damned sor't. On which King Edward rais'd an Host with speed, And came himself with them, to Wark on Tweed. Unto Corspatrick of Dunbar he sent, His Counsel asks, but on a bad intent, Who, when he came in Presence of that King, Advis'd him, and inform'd him ev'ry Thing. Then like a Rogue, against the Light of Nature To his own Country, proves a bloody Traitor: To Berwick goes the treach'rous hellish Knave, To undermine, destroy, cheat and deceive: Was welcom'd there, with more Respect than due, And thought by Scots both faithful, leill and true, King Edward follows on with all his Host By Treachery poor Berwick then was lost. Corspatrick rose, when all were sleeping sound, Drew the Portculzies, let the Bridges down. Edward he enters, bloodily falls on, Eight Thousand kills, and Fifty, spareth none. Then to Dunbar he and Corspatrick rode, Without Remorse, or any fear of God. There did the stout and valiant Scots conveen, With Resolution true, and Courage keen. To fight King Edward then the common Foe, Who dy'd in Blood, did thro' the Nation go: But by Deceit, and a prodigious Force, The Scots are here again put to the worse. The Earles Mar, Monteith, and Athol brave, No Access to their gallant Men could have: Who in the Castle closely were block'd up, And scarcely had, whereof to bite, or sup; So by no Means unto their Men could get, Corspatrick had the Castle so beset. At last the Armies march, and do inclose, Where the brave Scots, ov'r powred by their Foes, Rather than sly or cowardly to yeild, Do bravely fight, and die upon the Field. Thus to Corspatrick's everlasting stain, Without all Mercy, most of them were slain. For when the Battle hottest was, he then, Plague rot him; hew'd down all his Country-men. Great Loss the Scots at Berwick and Dunbar Had in this most unjust and cruel War. CHAP. II. How King Edward and Corspatrick came to Scoon, and deposed the Baliol. King Edward and Corspatrick march for Scoon, And Scotland now sings a most mournful Tune. Few Scots were left, the Kingdom to defend, Then for the Baliol to Montrose they send: And to their great and everlasting Shame, Do strip him of his Royal Diademe. When thus depos'd, Edward usurps the Crown, And then Alas, all Things went upside down. Was Crown'd upon the very self same Stone, Gathelius sent from Spain with his own Son. When Iber Scot first into Scotland came; Kenneth our King, and second of that Name, Brought it to Scoon, where Kings in Pomp and Glore, Were crowned for Eight hundred Years and more. Ev'n in that Ancient, Royal, Marble Chair, So Famous, and so long, preserved there. Which, as a Trophee, thence they do transport, To London where King Edward keep'd his Court. But yet I'm told that Ancient Fates decree, Where this Stone stands, Scots shall the Masters be. Bruce, with Eight score the Flow'r of Scotland then, Were Captives led away, with English-Men. At last the Pow'rs above, beheld the Wrong, And let not the Usurper Reign too long. For at this Time Scotland was almost lost, And overspread with a rude South'ron Host. Wallace his Father, to the Lennox fled, His eldest Son he thither with him led, The tender Mother's also gone at last, And to Kilspindie, with young Wallace past: Into the pleasant Carss of Gowrie, where, He was brought up with his old Uncle there: Who to Dundee him carefully does send, For Education, but behold the End. There he continues in his tender Age, Till more adult, than does he ramp and rage, To see the Saxon Blood in Scotland Reign, And govern'd, by a most unrighteous King. Who wrought great wrong in Country and in Town, Wasted our Lands, and broke our Buildings down, Maids, Wives, and Widows Chastity, they spill, Nor could the Nuns resist their lustful Will. King HEROD's Part they acted in the Land, Upon the Children, they before them fand: The Bishopricks that were of most avail, From Bishops, and Arch-Bishops, they took haill. Nor could the Pope, them with his threatnings scar, They gripped all, thro' violence of War. Of ev'ry Benifice was worth their while They took the Rents; left Bishops the bare Stile. Our Barrons kill'd, without Remorse, or Care, As testifie the bloody Barns of Air. Where Eighteen Score were hang'd by Saxon Seed, As in the Seventh Book you shall shortly read, But I go on with faithful Pen and true, And candidly my Purpose do pursue; Wallace, tho' young as yet for Sword or Spear, Did grieve, and groan, such Injuries to hear; Ah should my Country suffer such Distress Said he; and Suth'ron daily thus increase, O had I but Ten thousand at my Back, And were a Man, I'd gar their Curpons crack. Yet e'r he was full Seventeen Winters old, He was both Seemly, Strapping, Stout and Bold; Was with the South'ron frequently at Strife, And sometimes twinn'd them of their precious Life. By hewing down, all grew above their Neck; A certain token of true Scots respect. Then, left them sweltring in their Blood and Gore, A full Foot shorter than they were before. That they to Scots might give no more Offence, Wherewith his Priest most freely did Dispence: Absolv'd the Sin, and did remitt the Guilt Of South'ron Blood; so innocently spilt. Chap. III. How WALLACE kill'd Young Selbie the Constable's Son of Dundee. Unto Dundee Young Wallace now is gone, Sprightly and gay, as could be look'd upon, Well shap'd and handsome, Cliver, neat and clean, Clad with a Garment of a gemming Green. The Constable old Selbie, liv'd hard by, That crabbed Rogue, who most maliciously Oppress'd the Scots; with great despite and rage, A Son he had, near Twenty Years of Age: Who some young Fellows with him ev'ry Day Took to the Town; to sport the Time away. This vain young Fop, so much on folly bent, Young Wallace saw, then straight unto him went And with disdain, said, Scot, I pray thee stay, What Devil clad thee in a suit so gay: A Horse's Mantle, was thy kind to wear, And a Scots whittle at thy Belt to bear. Rough Roulion Shoes, or any common trash Did serve such Whore-Sons thro' the Dubs to plash Give me that Knife, under thy Girdle hings, Nay pardon me, Sir, I know better things; Therefore forbear, I earnestly intreat, It both defends me, and it cuts my Meat. Selbie assaults him, and would tak't by force, And so the Plea went on, from bad, to worse. Fast by the Collar Wallace did him take, Made the young Squire tremble there and shake, His Dager with the other Hand drew out, In spite of all his Men so throng about: And boldly without either fear or dread, Upon the spot he stick'd young Selbie dead. The Squire fell, of him there was no more, And then his Men pursu'd young Wallace sore; Who made a Pair of cleanly cliver Heels, And so escap'd from all the South'ron Chiels. The bloody Dagger fast held in his Hand, And spared none that did his Flight withstand. Unto an Inn he formerly did know, Thither he fled, and could no further go. Help help he cry'd, when the Good-Wife he saw, And save my Life from cruel South'ron Law. With Russet Gown she quickly got him drest Above his Cloaths, which cov'red all the rest: A sudled Curch o'er Head and Neck let fall, A white worn Hat then birsed on withal: And as the South'ron came into the Inn, Gave him a Rock then he began to spin. In quest of Wallace they some time have spent, But could not know at what Door in he went: They search'd thro' all the Corners of the Inn, But he sat still, and cunningly did spin: Tho' at the Trade he was not Prentice long, He drew a Threed, and cron'd away his Song. Away they went, then Wallace did revive, And leugh, and smirtl'd at them in his Sleeve. Like mad Men then, they all run up and down, Cry, burn the Scots, leave none alive in Town. Yet the Good-Wife, kept Wallace until Night Safe and secure, out of the Southrons sight. Thro' a back Way she did convey him fast, Where quietly he by the Water past. Such was his Mother's great Concern, and Care, That she of him did almost now despair. At length she met him to her great surprise, Bless me dear Son, may I believe mine Eyes, Is't possible thou hast the Danger past, Sure, Providence is more than kind at last. There he inform'd her of his doleful Case, At which she weep'd and often said alace, Ee'r thou leave off, thy Foes will have thee fang'd, Mother he said, I'd rather see them hang'd: These English Lowns that do possess our Land, Me-thinks we should most manfully withstand. His Uncle knew he had the Squire kill'd, Which the old Man with Grief and Sorrow fill'd: Yet did abate when a few Days were past, But dreaded Mischief to him at the last. The English now most subtile ev'ry way, A Ditty great 'gainst Scots prepared they, For, at Dundee they call a Justice air, No longer then durst Wallace sojourn there. His Mother clad her self in Pilgrim's weed, Then him disguis'd and both march'd off with Speed: Nought to defend himself he had from Foes, But a small Sword he bore below his Cloaths; Away they went, none with them living moe, When challeng'd, said, to St. Marg'ret we go. From Suth'ron Folk great Friendship thus they found, Because St. Margret was of English Ground. Closs by Lindores the Ferry ov'r they past, Then thro' the Ochell marched very fast: Into Dumfermling lodged all that Night, And on the Morrow by the Day was light They travel'd with some English Gentlemen, Who had their dwelling in Linlithgow then. A Captain's Wife who had a Pilgrim been Was there, who when she had young Wallace seen Did him admire; because he was so fair, Handsome, Gentile, and of engaging Air: There merrily they past the time around, Then cross'd the Forth straight to Linlithgow Town. Where mutually a Complement or two Was past, and then to Dunipace they go; There Wallace Friend did dwell a Parson great, Wallace by Name, of opulent Estate: A Man devout, who bravely made them fare And share the best, the time they tarried there. He did inform, and made them understand The troubles great that then were in the Land, Intreating them, in kind and homely Phrase, There to abide, till God sent better Days. Wallace reply'd, I hasten to the West, Our Kin are kill'd, were I at home, the best Of South'ron blood, I hope 'twixt you and me To let it out; then I'll avenged be. The Parson sigh'd, and said he much did doubt, It would be long e'r that time came about. Come well, come woe, my Purpose I'll pursue, Then to the honest Parson bad adiew. To Ellerslie he and his Mother went, She on the Morrow for her Brother sent, Who told her to her Sorrow, Grief and Pain, Her Husband and her eldest Son was slain. That, when Sir Malcom's Hough Sinews were cut South'ron to death upon his Knees he put: Till with their bloody Spears, they bore him down, Then stick'd that Glorious Knight of great Renown. Thus at Lochmabane, for their Country's sake, A noble Exit these Two Heroes make. To Ellerslie I back again repair, Where good Sir Rannald met his Sister there: Who did beseech and humbly pray'd also, That to Lord Piercy forthwith he would go: For from her House she would no longer fly, But long'd at Home for to live quietly. Sir Rannald in his Sisters Favours wrote, And then to her a safe Protection got; Which the brave Wallace highly did disdain, Therefore no longer would with her remain. Nor durst Sir Rannald entertain him there, So to his shift, away does Wallace fare. The English had the whole Strengths of the Land, And what they did none durst nor could withstand: Yet Wallace never could with them accord, For be he Squire, be he Laird or Lord, That with Disdain durst look him in the Face, He got a Blow unto his great Disgrace. The English Clerks in Prophecy have found, A Wallace, should put them from Scotish Ground Which afterwards prov'd to be very true, For thrice he drove away that barb'rous Crew. Sir Rannald now for him a Place prepares, To keep him safe from English Traps and Snares, With his own Uncle, who at Richardtoun Did dwell, and was Sir Richard of Renoun. In Heritage he had that whole Estate, Tho' blind he was, which chanc'd thro' Courage great 'Gainst Englishmen; whom he did daily dare, When he was Young, and well expert in War. Then did he burst some Veins, and lost much Blood, A Gentleman both Valiant, Wise, and Good. In Februar, Wallace was to him sent, And in April, a fishing from him went, Which will afford some Sport as you shall hear Pray listen then with an attentive Ear. CHAP. IV. How Wallace fish'd in Irvin Water. Dreading no harm, nor danger of his Foes, Wallace a fishing for Diversion goes To try what Sport and Pastime he might get, None with him but a Boy to bear his Net. Lucky he was, fish'd most successfully, Till the Lord Piercy, and his Court rode by: Which did confuse, and much perplex his Mind, Because he had forgot his Sword behind. Five of that trooping Train in Garments Green, Mounted on Horse-back, having Wallace seen To him advanc'd, and blustring Language gave, Then damn'd and swore, Zounds Scot thy Fish we'll have, With modest Grace good Wallace did reply, I'll share the half with you most chearfully, One of them answer'd that would be too small; Then lighted down, and from the Boy took all. Which in his Knapsack speedily he puts, The meikle sorrow be in's greedy Guts. Then Wallace said, I'm sure in Modestie You'll leave us some if Gentlemen you be; An aged Knight that lives in yonder House Let him have some pray, be so Generous. The Cloun he boasting said not one Word more, The River has enough behind in store: We serve a Lord shall Dine on them e'r long, Then Wallace fretting said thour't in the wrong; Whom thou's thou here, Faith thou deserves a Blow Poor prating Scot, how darest thou talk so. Then at him runs, and out his Sword does draw, But Wallace Poult-staff kept the Rogue in aw. That trusty Tree as the poor Scoundrel found, Lay'd him and Sword, both quickly on the Ground: Wallace the Sword caught fast into his Hand, Which did the saucy Fellow soon command: Then a back stroak so cliverly he gave, His Neck in two most cleanly there he clave. The other Four alighting from their Horse Do him attack; with all their Strength, and Force, Yet tho' they him surround on ev'ry Side, With handy Blows he pay'd them Back and Side. Upon the Head so fierce he struck at one, The shearing Sword cut thro' his collar Bone: Another on the Arm that stood near by, He struck; till Hand and Sword on Field did ly. Three slew he there, two fled with all their Might Unto their Horse in a confounded fright: Left all their Fish, no longer durst remain, And Three fat English Boucks upon the Plain. Thus in great hurry having got their Cuffs, They scamper'd off in haste to save their Buffs. When Piercy knew by the poor silly Lowns That Three were kill'd, and saw Two bloody Crowns, He quickly ask'd how many Foes might be They said but One, a Devil sure was he. Since One has killed Three, put Two to flight, Cowardly Coxcombs pack you out of sight: Most mastfully it seems the Scot has fought, For me this Day in Faith he's not be sought. Was't ever heard before? you Whore-Sons Burds That a Scots Poult-staff foil'd Five English Swords. To Wallace I return who by meer force Defeat the Five and pickt up all their Horse: Was better mounted than he was before, Rode to his Uncle, fish'd that Day no more. The News did so surprise the ancient Knight, He almost fainted in his Nephews sight: Then bids keep secret: for such fishing sport If it be known you may pay dearly for't. Uncle said Wallace, to the good old Man, I'll push my Fortune now where best I can: Since I no longer may with you abide, I'll try these English Geldins how they ride. A Purse of Gold, the Knight unto him gave, Wallace kneel'd down, and humbly took his leave, When that is done, pray Nephew send for more, Thus ends the First Book, here I draw my Score. The Second BOOK OF Sir William Wallace CHAP. I. How WALLACE kill'd the Churle with his own Saff in Air. Young Wallace now cliver of Lith and Limb, With gracefull Air appears, both Tight and Trim; Which with his many other youthfull Charms, Confounds the South'ron, highly them alarms. His glorious Actions early did presage, A humbling Stroak to cruel South'ron Rage: Which did so many of his Friends destroy, As scarce was known since Adam was a Boy. Yet the late fishing, makes poor Wallace fond At Ochter-House a little to abscond; Then to the Laigland-Wood when it grew late, To make a silent and a soft retreat. Some little Time thereafter did repair, Unto the pleasant ancient Town of Air; Closs by the Wood did there dismount his Horse, Then on his Foot walk'd gravely to the Cross. Lord Piercy did command the Castle then, And the whole Town did swarm with Englishmen. Which sight no doubt did Wallace much confound, Yet never dash'd, but briskly walk'd around; Tho' some affirm, which I am apt to trow, He in his Heart curs'd the Barbarian Crew. And being prompted by his youthful Age, Could scarce refrain his Passion and his Rage. But passing over this, I now make haste, To entertain you with a handsome Jest, Into the Town liv'd a hudge English Fellow, All overgrow'n with Gutts of T?rd and Tallow Who greatly brag'd of his prodigious Strength, Which cost him dear as you shall hear at length, A greater burden said this Prince of Sotts He'd bear, than any Three good sturdy Scots, And with a Staff like a Stage-dancers Pole, For one poor Groat he would permit and thole: The strongest Man to beat him on the Back; So imprudently did the Carle crack. Which Story when it came to Wallace Ear, To smile and laugh he scarce could well forbear; He told the Fellow that he would be willing, For one Scots blow to give an English Shilling. The greedy Wretch did freely condescend, Which quickly brought him to his fatal End: Then Wallace gave him such a dreadful Thump Upon his back, closs by his great fat Rump, That to the View of all were present there, He clave his Rig-bone, and he ne'er spake mair: Thus dy'd the Wretch for a poor Price and small, And his great English Hurdies pay'd for all. With Swords round Wallace then the English flock He no Ways dash'd did his Steel Bonnet cock, And struck a South'ron with that trusty Tree, Out ov'r the Head till Brains and Bones did flee, Then cliverly with such good Will and Luck, On the Steel Baisnet hath another struck, Till, tho', the noble Tree it frush'd and rave, He kill'd the Fellow and turn'd to the lave; Then with an awful grace he made a paw, And out his Sword with Majesty did draw; Which clear'd his way like a true Friend indeed, And quickly help'd him to a sturdie Steed. Two soutie Fellows there, that griev'd him most He dous'd their Doublets rarely to their Cost: His anger kindled, to such height it grew, With one good stroak the foremost there he slew, A Blow he got upon the other Knave; Till his good Sword, down thro' his Body drave. Five South'ron he 'twixt Hope and great Despair, Kill'd on the Spot; now was not that right fair. Out thro' the Town, his Way did cleanly force, Made his Escape and then did mount his Horse: To Langlands fled, his Time he well did use, And left the Blades all sleeping in their Shoes. Him Foot and Horse pursue to overtake, But the thick Trees his Refuge he did make; Provisions come to him from Ochter House, And ev'ry Thing that was fit for his use: Such necessarys they to him afford, As [illeg.] suply him, both to Bed and Board. Good Wallace then upon a Time at length, Return'd to Air, as he recover'd strength, But ah it prov'd a most unlucky Day, I wish to Jove that he had stay'd away, Sir Rannald's Servant for some Fish he sent, That Errand O! that Wallace had miskent, For as you'll quickly understand, and hear, The Sauce was Sharp, and cost him very dear. CHAP. II. How WALLACE kill'd Lord Piercies Steward, and was imprison'd in Air. The Fish no sooner had the Servant got, Then Piercies Stewart called, and said Scot, For whom buys thou those Fish thou carrys there, Who answer'd Sir, for the Sheriff of Air. By Heaven's King, the Stewart rudely swore, My Lord shall have them, thou may purchase more; Wallace incens'd with Anger, standing by, Said why such rudeness, tell the Reason why, This fired soon the haughty Stewarts Blood, Who thought what Wallace spoke, was next to rude, And did his Stomach so with Venom fill, As might the vilest loathsome Spider kill. Go hence said he, thou saucy Scot with speed, Thee and thy Sheriff both I mock indeed. Then with his hunting Staff he Wallace smote, But he had better kiss'd his Bum, poor Sott. For Wallace by the Throat him quickly caught, And the proud Stewart better Manners taught. Then from his Pocket pull'd a Dagger-Knife, Which twinn'd the foolish Coxcomb of his Life. But Ah! Alass, how quick assembled then Fourscore at least, well harnish'd English-Men: Whose Post it was to watch and guard the Town, There suddenly poor Wallace they surround. At them he star'd and never spoke a Word, But boldly drew his awful daring Sword: And cliverly unto his Feet did get, And stick'd the foremost Fellow that he met. Upon the Knee another hit he so, That Moment made the Bone asunder go. Nor can I say the Third had better luck, Who got his Neck in two most cleanly cut. Thus Wallace rag'd and ramped Lion like, And made the Carles strangely fidge and fyke. No wonder for they got most grievous Wounds, So desp'rately he claw'd their South'ron Crowns. And tho' the Gate with Sword and Spears they keep, He hew'd them down like heartless sillie Sheep: Yea when they him inviron'd round about, Quite thro' the Press he suddenly broke out, Unto a Wall was built by the Sea-side, Where in his own Defence he did abide. Till from the Castle issu'd one and all, Got on a Dyke, and then broke down the Wall. No shift he had but there to fight or die, Great Numbers then he hew'd down hastily: So furiously out thro' the South'ron past, But Oh! his noble Sword did burst at last, Broke from the Hilt, he knew of no Remeed, Then stoutly drew his Dagger out with speed. One there he kill'd, and other Two he sent To Death, the same way that the first Chiell went But at the last, his Foes on ev'ry Hand They rudely rush with Spears, and him command. Such was their pity they forbid to slay, But starve with Hunger, till he'd pine away. Thus they the sacred Scriptures verify, The Wicked's Mercy's are meer Cruelty. With English now he's Pris'ner gone at will, Had he got Help he would have fought them still. To speak of Ransom that was all in vain, Because that Day so many he had slain. His Trouble here I scarcely well can tell, His Prison much resembled that of Hell. Such Meat and Drink as they to him allow, Would kill and Poison ev'n a very Sow. But here I leave him in this doleful Case, Till Providence shall order his Release. The woeful Weeping and the piteous Moan Was made for him, would rent a Heart of Stone; No Comfort here to dissipate their Fears, Nought to be seen but pale Cheeks stain'd with Tears. Alass said they, can Life endure to see, Wallace imprison'd, by the Enemy: The Flow'r of Youth in sweet and tender Age, Made subject to the cruel Saxon Rage. Living this Day a Chiftain there is none, Like the young Wallace; for its he alone, That's capable of Scotland to take care, But now he's caught into the woeful Snare. CHAP. III. How WALLACE was imprisoned in Air, and escaped. Herrings and Water, for his Nourishment, And such sad Stuff to Wallace they present: Instead of what was wholesome cleanly Food, Got the Refuse of ev'ry Thing was Good. Thus in the Prison languishing he lay, Till Death was pictur'd in his beauteous Clay His vital Spirits almost spent and gone, Then to Jehovah made his piteous Moan: Confess'd his Sins, most humbly then implor'd Mercy thro' CHIRST, his Saviour and LORD. Then said, my GOD, O please for to receive My Soul and Body, I thee humbly crave. For if Relief thou do not quickly send, My Days in Prison here I'll shortly End. Please to prolong my Days O GOD to me, Since my Belief is wholly upon thee: Which by thy Grace thou graciously hast wrought, And me from Hell by thine own Blood hast bought. Why wilt thou give thy Handy-work to those, Who are our Nation's and my mortal Foes. And who maliciously this Land abhor, Would me destroy with many others more. O bruckle Sword, thy Mettal was not true, Thy frushing Blade, me in this Prison threw: To English Men, ov'r little Harm thou's done, Of gallant Scots who kill'd so many a one. Of us indeed they have not kill'd a few, My valiant Father, and bold Brother too, Were at Lochmabane kill'd by South'ron, But Death resisted sure can be by none. This Ancient Kingdom, LORD do thou relieve, From English Thraldom and Deliverance give. Tho' now O LORD my Pow'r be gone indeed, Yet King of Kings help thou and send Remeed. Of worldly Comforts now I take my leave, I shall be shortly where I shall not grieve: Thus heartily to all I bid adieu, None other Gift have I to leave you now. Adieu Wallace that was both strong and stout, Long in this Prison thou must ly no doubt: Now all thy noble Kindred brave and bold Thy Freedom purchase cannot, no with Gold. Thy tender Mother that in Pain thee bore, In her soft Arms shall ne'er inclose thee more; How seemly was thou, with thy Sword and Shield, When thou kill'd Numbers on the bloody Field. Complain ye Poor, with Rev'rence tell your tale, Complain to Heavens, with Words that cannot fail: Lift up your Voice to the great GOD above, That's full of Mercy, Pity, and of Love. Complain for him that sits in dismal Cells, And in the melancholly Dungeon dwells: With Grief and Pain; which he scarce can endure, Pray for's Relief, to the great GOD of Pow'r: Complain ye Birds that once were blyth and glad, Now change your Notes, and hang the drooping Head. Complain ye Lords, complain ye Ladies bright, Complain for him that worthy was and wight: Complain ye Men of War in mournful Song For him, of Saxon's Sons that suffers Wrong. Complain for him, who lyes both Day and Night, In Prison, for maintaining Scotland's Right, Complain for him who did most frequently, Sound up the Triumphs of our Victory. What shall I say of the brave Wallace more, A cruel Flux in Prison, and a sore, Did then almost reduce him to last Breath, And left him gasping in the Jaws of Death. The Jaylor now's commanded with great Aw, To bring him to the Sentence of their Law. Who, when he view'd him, to his great surprise, Thought Death already had shut up his Eyes. In haste returns, and does report the News, That he had paid both Law and Prison-Dues. Perswaded thus, that he was very dead, For Wallace now there was no more remeed. Being concluded, by Consent of all, To throw him quickly ov'r the Castle-Wall. But Providence which Interposes oft, Directs his Fall into a Place was soft; His Nurse which liv'd in the New-Town of Air, Hearing the News in haste came running there And on her Knees with Face as pale as Clay, Did purchase leave to bear his Corps away. With Sorrow, him unto her House she bore, Then with warm Water bath'd his Body o'er. His Heart she found to flighter to and fro, His Eyes at last they did cast up also. Then on a Bed she laid him soft as Silk, And suckled him with her own Daughters Milk. Her love to him and tender Care was such, In a short Time he did recover much. Thus secretly she did him Nurse and Feed, And made the Word still pass, that he was Dead. She weeped sore in ev'ry Body's sight, Till he became both able stout and tight. Thomas the Rhymer at that very Time, Who prophecy'd in Ancient Scotish Rhyme, In vulgar Estimation not the least, Did pay a Visit to the Parish-Priest: Whose Servant, had just at the Mercate been, And what befel poor Wallace there, had seen. The Priest, does on his Servant quickly call, What News said he? Sir few or none at all. The Priest said, that he never yet did know, The Scots and English part without a Blow. Good Wallace, quoth the Lad; and shook his Head, I Saw them cast him ov'r the Wall for dead; The Priest replyed with a heavy Heart, For that I hope to see the South'ron smart Wallace was Wight, and come of gentle Blood, Thomas he said, the Tidings were not good. The Priest said surely they would foster Feud, But Thomas said, that Wallace was not Dead. The Servant told, he saw a Woman there, That did belong to the New-Town of Air: Upon her Knees from South'ron Purchase leave To carry Wallace somewhere to his Grave. Pensive a little, Thomas in his Thought, By God said he, that hath this World wrought, And brings to pass each Thing for his own Glore, If he be dead, Thomas shall live no more. The honest Priest hearing him speak so plain, He charg'd his Servant to return again, To view the Woman's House, and carefully, To look about, what he could hear or spy. The Servant thus in haste is gone away, Straight to the House, and Place where Wallace lay. Who's this lyes here, he did demand in plain, The Woman rose in Sorrow, Grief, and Pain; The worthy Wallace, Oh! replied she, Then weeped sore, and very piteously. She on her Knees did pray, for JESUS sake; He would conceal, and no Discovery make. The Servant answer'd with a fearful Oath, That he to harm him would be very loath: Might he on Life but see him with his Eyes, He would rejoice or curs'd might he be Thrice. She, to good Wallace led him up the Stairs, There saw him gladly, and he back Repairs: To Thomas, and his Master, who attend To hear the Story all, from End to End He told them, the first Tidings were a Lie, Then Thomas said, before that Wallace die. Out of this Land he shall the South'ron send, And Thousands on the Field make their last End. He Scotland Thrice shall bring into great Peace, And South'ron ay be frighted at his Face. Then chear up Scots, cast from you Care and Sloath, And pray believe what Thomas says is Truth. When Wallace Actions we to light produce, We'll find him not Inferior to Bruce: But 'cause the Bruce, was of our Kingdom Heir, Wallace therefore with him we'll not compare. Yet by his Courage, and his Conduct wise, As we have heard, he rescu'd Scotland thrice. Unto the Nation's universal Joy, The Time he was the Baliol's Viceroy. CHAP. IV. The Battle of LOUDON-HILL. Now to my Purpose gladly I return Since I for Wallace need no longer mourn: Who when he found himself in Case to ride, Thought it not safe in New-Town to abide. Then to the cruel South'rons great surprize, Once more appears, them frights and terrifies: His Nurse, her Daughter, Child, and Family, He first dispatch'd away to Ellerslie. When they were gone, no Weapon could he find There; that could suit and please his anxious Mind. Except a Sword, that in a Nook did stand, O'er grown with Rust, which he took in his Hand. He drew the Blade, and found it well could bite, Which pleas'd his Fancy to a very Mite. Then blythly said, Faith thou shall go with me, Till with a better I provided be. To see his Uncle good Sir Rannald, then Fain would he go, but that the English-Men; Who cunningly for him had laid the Snare, He fear'd, might catch him in his Journey there. At Richartoun then longed for to be, To get some Horse and Armour quietly, With all Precaution Wallace ventur'd fair, Yet met Three South'ron riding unto Air; Long-Castle bold, and with him Yeo-men Two, Wallace drew back and would not with them go. At him they ride, and said despitefully, Thou Scot abide, for sure thou art a Spy: Or else some Thief, that dares not show thy Face, But Wallace answer'd with a modest Grace, Sir, I am sick, for GOD's Love let me be, Long-Castle said by George that shall not be, Thy Countenance prognostick's something Odd, To Air with me thou shalt travel the Road, Pull'd out a Sword, that was of noble Hew, His rusty Sword, good Wallace also drew. Then with a single, but a dreadful Blow, He clave his Neck-Bone cliverly in Two. The Yeo-Men then, in haste soon lighted down, The First miss'd not a Clink out o'er his Crown. Which to the Craig a clean Incision made A brave Performance by the rusty Blade. The other fled, and durst no longer stay, He scar'd at Blood; that was the Reason why, But Wallace quickly brought the Culzeon back, And there gave him the Whissle of his Plack. Along his Ribs he gave him such a Rout, Till all his Intralls and his Lungs hang out. Then took their Horses, and their Armour bright, Their noble Weapons, cliver clean and tight. And all their Coin, syne on his Horse he cocked, With Gold and Money jingling in each Pocket. Then in great haste he rode to Richartoun, A merry Meeting was at's lighting down. Sir Richard he was there, that noble Kight, Who mourning for him almost lost his Sight. And his two Sons who never were so fain, As now, to see Wallace alive again. Sir Rannald also came to see him fast, The Women told, by Corsby as they past, How Wallace scap'd; Sir Rannald changed Hewes, He wanted Faith to credit the good News. Till he him saw, he thought the Time was long, But when they met, who can express with Tongue, How him he hass'd, and kiss'd so tenderly, Till's very Soul was in an Exstasy; The Tears of Joy which from his Eyes did flow, E'er he could speak a long Time held him so, But at the last, most lovingly said he, Welcome dear Nephew, Welcome Home to me. Thanked be GOD that hath this Wonder wrought, And safely out of Prison hath thee brought. His Mother came, and Kinsfolk not a Few, With joyful Heart, to know those Tydings true. To Robert Boyd, that worthy was and Wight, Wallace he was a blyth and welcome Sight. From ev'ry different Airt they crowd and come, To visit, and to welcome Wallace home. Thanks be to GOD, who did to him dispense So happy, kind, and good a Providence. Here ends my Second Book, I say no more, But quietly I draw a Second Score. The Third BOOK OF Sir William Wallace CHAP. I. How WALLACE revenged the Slaughter of his Father, and of his Brother on LOWDON-HILL. Now July deck'd in all her trim Array, On Hill and Dale did Fruits and Flow'rs display Blyth was each Beast that breaks the tender Blade Of Grass, or Nibbles in the Green-Wood shade; And Store of Fish came in at ev'ry Firth, Most dainty Chear, and got with mickle Mirth, But Scotland all this while, sad skaith of Wars, Oppress'd with Want in doleful Case appears. For many a Day throughout this hurry'd Land No Plough was drawn, but Labour at a stand: So that by August came with lack of Meat, Our Folk with thin Chaft-Blades look'd unco' Bleat. But English-Men, who wanted not for Gear, Were well hain'd Callans, and had ay good Chear. For to them duly in good Waggons came All Things to gust the Gab, and cram the Wame. Well Fed were they; nor wanted to propine Among their Friends; but tifted canty Wine. So cruce they grew, might no Man them withstand, But as they lik'd they rul'd o'er all this Land, Till Tidings came, that Wallace stout and fair. Had broke their Prison in the Town of Air; Which when they heard, they suddenly were cast Into the Dumps, and stood right sore Agast. Earl Piercy too, when he had heard this Tale, E'en thol'd the Loss, as he had tint his Cale; And thus he spoke, I mickle dread that we, My merry Men, this doleful Day shall dree. For if so be that Wallace is not fast, From Edward's Yoke he'll free this Land at last. So Prophesies of Old-long-Time have said, As they inform who Antique Legends read; And tho' of Legends we and Spells might doubt, Yet well the Loon, I ken, and ken him stout. And think it better, since better may not be, To fleech him off, with Gold and Land in Fee. Might he stand stedfast for King Edward, then Might all the Land be rul'd by English-Men. By Force, his late escaping let's us see, Not to be dung, or vanquished is he: Thus they forsooth, to Wallace we return: Sore thrawn was he, and did with Anger burn. In Richartoun no longer would he bide, For Friends Advice or ought that might betide. So when they saw their Counsel all was tint, They let him take his Will, and furth he went, To venge him, if he might upon the Plain, On South'ron Blood that had his Kindred slain. Sir Richard had three Sons, as has been told, Adam, Richard, and Simeon, brave and bold: The eldest Adam, might no Man him flee, So stout, tho' Aged but Eighteen was he, Of Person large, right hardy wise and wight; Thereafter good King Robert made him Knight. For in the Bruce's Wars his trusty Arm, On English-Men had oft wrought mickle Harm. This valiant Squire with Wallace furth did ride. Into the Field, and so did Robert Boyd, A canty Carle, who scorn'd, he was so cruce, The English Yoke, nor with their King made truce. Cleland was there, who was of Wallace Blood, And had with him full oft in Perils stood, And Edward Little, his Sisters Son so dear; A goodly Gang, all graith'd in Armour clear. Accouter'd thus, from Richartoun they rode, To Machlin-Mure, but short time there abode; For Friends inform'd them, that in Bondage were, How Fenwick straight was coming on to Air, With Waggon Loads of Vittal, and rich spoil, And good Purvey, they brought them from Carlile. This Wallace heard, a blyth Man then was he, And inly gran'd at bloody Game to be. To Lowdon then they trysted straight to ride, And in a Shaw a little there beside They lodg'd them, and being it was Night, Kept Watch from gloming till the Morning Light. A good true Scot, who kept a Stabling there By Lowdon-Hill a true Scot late and air, Frae be't he saw them, came within a Blink, And brought them wealth of Meat and tosie Drink, Syn told them, how the Carriage-Men in Haste, Had sent Fore-riders who to Air had past, Leaving the Rest with Pow'r of great Avail, Who were by then, he trow'd in Annandale Then Wallace said we must not sojourn here, Nor change our Weeds, but wear our ilk-day Gear. For ay since from his Prison he got free, A Summer-Weed was all the Weed had he, Harness except, which still he wore for Life, To work his will in case of sudden Strief. A good Habergion cover'd with his Gown, Was in his Hand, a Steel-Cap on his Crown. Two Gloves of Plate his Hands did guard full well; Close was his Doublet, and the Collar Steel. His Face when he came in among strange Folk, He held it best to hide within his Cloak. Else in the Battle it was ever bare: On Foot no Champion might with him compare, So strong he was, so Terrible and Sture; His dreadful Dints were gruesome to endure. More did they set if Wallace had been tane, Than if a Hundred South'ron Lowns were slain. These worthy Scots would now no longer stay; To Lowdon-Hill they past by break of Day, Devis'd the Place, and loose their Horses turn, And thought to win, or never home return. Two Scouts they sent to visit well the Plain, But they right soon returned in again, Reporting, how the Foes were coming fast; Then quickly on the Ground they all them cast, Praying with humble Heart the GOD of Might, Them to protect, and Scotland's broken Right. In Harness bright they graith'd them readily, Nor flinch'd there One of all the Company. Said Wallace then, here was my Father slain, And Brother dear which doth me mickle Pain; So shall my self, or veng'd be on that Head, The Traitor here, that caus'd the fellon Deed. NO longer tarrying, now with hearty Will Incontinent they hy'd them up the Hill. Fenwick the Knight the Convoy did command; And mickle Dole had he wrought in the Land. The Sun was up, and dight in bright Array, When English-Men saw them upon the Brae. Them as he saw said Fenwick to his Men, Yon Wallace is, for well the Lown I ken. Tho' he so lately did our Prison break, Soon gripp'd again, he's no have leave to crack. His Head, I ken, would better please our King. Than Gold, or Land, or any earthly Thing. With Carriage he his Servants bade bide still, Then with the lave he thought to work his Will, Ninescore he led in Harness burnish'd bright; And Fifty were with Wallace in the Right. Unrebated the South'ron were in Weir, And fast they came, full awful in Effeir. A Dyke of Stones they had quite round them made, And proudly there with great Rampaging rade. The Scots on Foot the Pass took them before; The South'ron saw, their Courage was the more. In prideful Ire they thought oe'r them to ride; But not as they did wish it chanc'd that Tide. For Scots on Foot, great room about them made With prancing Spears, and sore upon them laid. The South'ron, who were arm'd in Plates of Steel, That Day did reckon to avenge them well, And rudely on their Horse about them rade, That scarce with Ease upon their Feet they bade. Wallace the foremost met so fell and keen, The wayward Spear went through his Body clean. Then Swords were drawn both heavy, sharp and lang, On either Side full cruelly they dang. A sore Assailzie then then there might be seen Of Horse and Men, as e'er was on the Green. The English-Men, who were expert in Weir, Thought by main Force the Scots quite down to bear And with their Horse environ'd them about, That of the Day they made no longer doubt. But our Men stoutly to their Orders stood, And dy'd the Field that Day with South'ron Blood. Fenwick, their Captain dight in glittering Gear, Did on a prancing Steed that Day appear; Forth to the thickest Fight he hies him fast, And syne his Spear with dreadful Fury cast. A cruel Chiel he was and unco' keen; Of Wallace Father he the Death had been, And Brother also, whom he held so dear, Who when he saw the Traitor Knight was near, Outragious as a hungry Lyon grew, And at full speed to claw his Noddle flew; Syn at the Lown a fearfull Fleg let flee, That from his Rumple shear'd away his Thigh. Ere he was dead, a throng came in so fast, Poor Robert Boyd was almost smor'd at last. Wallace was near and turned in again To rescue him, then chas'd them through the Plain; The Remnant follow'd after them full fast, And drave the South'ron, till they were aghast. There Adam Wallace, Heir of Richartown Ane Beaumont strake a Squire of much Renoun, Right Belly-flaught, so that withoutten mair The burnish'd Weapon him in sunder share. Some English yet, altho' their Chief was slain, Them still abode as Men of mickle Main; Where Wallace was their Deed was little ken'd, Tho' they did all themselves for to defend. For he behav'd himself so worthily, With Robert Boyd, and all their Chivalry, That not a Southeron ere Even-tide, Might any longer in that Stour abide, But thought their Part was plainly for to flee, Which een as many did as could win free. An Hundred at this Bruilliement were kill'd; Three Yeomen Wallace left upon the Field, Two were of Kyle, and One of Cunningham, Who left to follow Wallace their own Hame. Of English Men Fourscore escap'd that Day, Leaving their Convoy to the Scots a Prey, Who there got wealth of Gold, and other Gear, Harness and Horse, and Things of Use in Weir. The English Knaves they made the Carriage lead To Clyde's Green-Wood, till they were out of dread; Syn sair and fast with Widdies they them band To Boughs of Trees, and hang'd them out of hand. None did they spare that able was for Weir; But Priests and Women they did ay forbear. When this was done, full blyth they went to dine; For they no scant of Vittail had, or Wine. Tenscore of harnest Horse they got that Day, Beside good Provender, and other Prey. THE South'ron now, who from the Field did fly, With Sorrow to the Town of Air them hie. There to Lord Piercy dolefully relate Their sad Disaster, and unsonsy Fate, What skaith he got and who were slain in Fight, And how his Men were hang'd by Wallace Wight. Said Piercy then, if Wallace long we bear, Out of this Land he shall exile us clear. Certes when lately he our Prisoner was O'er slothfully our Keeper let him pass. Not safe ev'n in this Fortress shall we be, Since now our Vittal we must bring by Sea. Besides it grieves me for our Men so true, Our Kin the Day that we came here may rue. CHAP. II. How the English Men made Peace with WALLACE. When Wallace now had vanquish'd in the Field The Traitor false, that had his Father kill'd, And Brother als, that brave and worthy Knight, With many more, that all were Men of Might; He caus'd provide, and distribute their Store, To go on new Exploits, and purchase more. In Clyde's Green-Wood they did sojourn three Days; No South'ron might Adventure in those Ways. Death did they thole, durst in their Gate appear; And Wallace Word did Travel far and near. When it was heard he living was again, The English Men thereof had mickle Pain. Earl Piercy straight to Glasgow did him fare, And of wise Lords a Council summon'd there. And tho' they had Ten thousand Men, or mo, Would yet no Chiftain out on Wallace go, So did they dread the Carle. Then did devise How they by wylie Gates might him surprize. Sir Aymer Vallange, that false Knight and strong, In Bothwel dwelt, and then was them among; He said, my Lords, my Counsel I'll propone, Which if ye take, ye mickle Skaith shall shun; Peace must be made withoutten more Delay, Or he more wicked Pranks than these will play. Lord Piercy said, with him no Truce can be, A Carle so haughty, and so fell is he. More Mischief he will do before he blin; For South'ron Blood to shed, he thinks no Sin. Reply'd Sir Aymer, Truce ye sorely need; Thereafter ye may find out some remead. I think 'twere best, so Gentle he's and True, To try what good his Kin with him can do. This Matter bid Sir Rannald take in Hand With his Nevoy, or forfeit all his Land, Untill such Time as he the Work hath wrought. Sir Rannald straight was to the Council brought, Where him they charg'd with Wallace Peace to gain Or he in London Prisoner should remain. Sir Rannald said, my Lords, ye know right well, For my Advice he will not do a deal. His worthy Kin ye cruelly have slain, And caus'd himself in Prison thole much Pain How think ye then, he'll do this thing for me Now he's at large, although you caus'd me die. Lord Piercy then did speak Sir Rannald fair; Make but this Peace, thou Sherriff art of Air. And if the Bus'ness can accomplish'd be, Under my Seal I shall be bound to thee, That English-Men shall do him no Distress, Nor any Scot, withoutten due Redress. Sir Rannald knew he could not them gainstand, So undertook what Piercy did Command; Piercy who True and Valiant still had been, And mild in Peace although in Battle keen. Hy'd then Sir Rannald to the Woods of Clyde, Where Wallace Wight did with his Men abide, With whom forgath'ring as to Dine he went, He sat him down, and shar'd their Merriment, And feasted was with Dainties rare and fine; King Edward's self drunk never better Wine. Then after Meat, his Errand he declar'd, And how unless he came, he would have far'd; Nevoy, said he, part of my Counsel take, And for a Season, Truce with Southrons make; To bear their Yoke, that would indeed be Sin, Who are so set to ruin all thy Kin. Then Wallace said unto his Men, shall be No Peace, unless ye better like than me. Said Boyd, before this worthy Knight should fall, I think, 'twere best make Peace tho' sore it gall. For that Advice Cleland put in his Word; And Adam, Heir of Richartoun concurr'd: As they agreed, did Wallace Peace proclaim, In hopes within few Months to gain his Aim. Then leave they took full sadly on the Plain, Praying they might in safety meet again; Each went his Ways; and Wallace bound to ride, To Crosbie with Sir Rannald to abide. In August's pleasant Month was cry'd this Peace; And Mars and Juno their Contentions cease, Saturn grew mild; and all the Stars above Gave Place to Venus, gentle Queen of Love. CHAP. III. How WALLACE slew the Buckler-player in the Town of Air. But Wallace Wight still tholing in his Breast His Countrys Wrongs, at Crosbie could not rest, Much did he grane in Travel for to be, And sorely long'd the Town of Air to see. So with Sir. Rannald passing on a Day, Fifteen he took and to the Town went they. Disguis'd they went, and in the Gate they saw An English Fencer at the Weapon shaw. There as he stood, his Buckler in his Hand, Wallace near by a looker on did stand. Lightly he said, Scot darst thou 'sye a stroke? Quoth Wallace, yea, gan thou dar'st with me Yoke, Smite on he said, thy Nation I defy; Wallace therewith a fleg at him let fly; The Sword so fell was on the Buckler cast, Clear thro' his Harns it to his Shoulder past. Lightly returning to his Men again, The Women made a Din our Fencer's slain. The Man is dead; what need's of Words mair? Fell Men of Arms then round him 'sembled there. Eight Score at once upon Sixteen they set; But Wallace quickly with the foremost met, And lent him with good will a fearful Blow, That thro' the Helmet shatter'd all his Pow. Syne strake another so the Breast aboon, The Sword went clear throughout th'unsonsy Loon, Great Room he made, so did his trusty Men, Till many a feckful Chiel that Day was slain. For they were Wight, and well train'd up in Weir, On English-Men right boldly did they bear. Great Slaughter of the Enemies they made; Their hardy Chief so well about him laid; Till from the Castle new Recruits they spy'd. Which Wallace seeing, wisely turn'd aside, Thinking it safest to evite Surprise; For he in War was not more Wight than Wise. Then thro' the Throng as by main Force he past, Their Harns and Heads asunder hew'd he fast. Himself return'd the hindmost in the Rear, Till he had brought his Men quite out of Fear. Then to their Horse they went; thereafter rode For better safety to the Laglan Wood. Twenty and Nine they fell in that days Feed Of Southeron Men that nevel'd were to Dead. The Remnant to the Town did flee amain, Cursing the Peace with Wallace they had tane, Earl Piercy at the Heart was sorely griev'd To find his Men thus wofully mischiev'd. Three of his Kinsmen whom he held full dear, Were slain that fatal Day in Armour clear. Great moan he made, then to Sir Rannald sent A Herald, charging him incontinent, Wallace to keep from Market, Town and Fair, (Skaith to prevent) where South'ron did repair. The South'ron knew it Wallace was alone, That them on this Mischance had overthrown, And therefore kept the Truce made on their Word, And liv'd with other Scots in good Accord. Now Wallace on a Night from Laglane rade To Corsbie, where the Knight his Uncle bade. Upon the Morn, by it was peep of Day Came in Sir Rannald where Wight Wallace lay, Shew'd him the Writ Earl Piercy to him sent, And did entreat that he would give Consent To do no Skaith to any English born, Until the Truce were ended which was sworn. Said Wallace, nought of Harm's be done by me, That you may grieve, while I abide with thee. His Uncle with him then accorded was, And bad him welcome there his Time to pass. There did he bide the Space of Seventeen Days, Obey'd in ilky Thing that might him please. But in his Mind remain'd another Thing; Nor could he rest him tho' he were a King, Till he his Friends, and native Land might see From Thraldom, and proud English Lowns set free. The Fourth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace CHAP. I. How WALLACE won the Peel of Gargunnock. 'Twas now September, crown'd with Fruits, and Corn. For Sustenance of ev'ry Creature born When many English Peers of high Renown In Council did conveen in GLASGOW Town. Behov'd Sir Rannald Crawford then be there; For he of Right was Sheriff born of Air. With him his Nephew William Wallace went, And only Servants Three, that their Intent Might not misconstru'd by proud South'rons stand, And thereby bring new Mischiefs on the Land. But long they on their Journey had not been, Ere Piercy's Baggage passing by was seen. Five Men, that were its Convoy, march'd beside Of these, Two walk'd on Foot, and Three did ride. With tedious Journey now their Horse were tir'd, So they Sir Rannald's from his Men requir'd; Which mildly when refus'd, with Might and Main They rob'd these honest Scots upon the Plain. This Wallace saw, and sorely griev'd was he Such Mischief wrought upon his Men to see. But mindful how his Uncle did engage His Word, he now restrain'd his deadly Rage; Yet from his Party presently withdrew Burning with Anger and Revenge in View, To lie in wait for the rapacious Breed, Who thus had perpetrate this foul Misdeed. Near to Cathcart did he them overtake, And rudely straightway in among them brake. A burnish'd Blade that Tide did he unsheath, Which none provok'd, that e'er evited Death, Their Foreman first with such good will he gave, That Hat and Head together off he drave. Syn on the Ground Two of his Comerades laid; The others fled discomfit and afraid. While Wallace seizing on their Gold and Gear, And passing Clyde, got into Lennox clear. Leaving his Friends his Absence to lament, With Wallace to pass on is our Intent. To Malcom then of Lennox mighty Earl His Way took this great Chief, the Scottish Pearl. The Earl receiv'd him in a courteous Way, And much intreated still with him to stay, Off'ring, that he his Men should all command; But Wallace, grieving for his Native Land, Resolv'd what store of Men he might to raise, To combat in the Field for Scotland's Praise. Steven of Ireland, exil'd from his Home, Did there into a League with Wallace come. So did Fawdoun a Man of dreadful size, Of threatning Aspect, and iniquous Eyes; Seldom he smil'd, was gruesome to the Sight; And Blood and Batt'ry was his sole Delight. With these, and sixty more went Wallace forth, Their valiant March directing to the North. Full in their Way upon Gargunnock Hill The South'ron Bands had fortify'd a Peil, With Chambers meet, and Hall commodious built. And Strength of Men, and store of Victual fill'd Wallace this Piece determin'd to take in, Could it be slily done withoutten Din. Spies having sent, and finding all was right, Resolv'd on th'Enterprize that very Night. His hardy Men at Arms were sent before, To break a Bar that held the outmost Door. But they in vain to break it did Essay, Till Wallace fretting at the long Delay, Came on himself, and with a furious shock The Bar and Steeple all in Flinders Broke, Then open drave the Gate, and there withal Came tumbling down three Ell-Breadth of the Wall. Much marvel did his Men, who saw this Storm, And him do more than Twenty could perform. The Passage clear'd, into the House they rush'd, And all that did oppose before them push'd. A Watch-Man had a fellon Staff of Steel, Wherewith he Wallace thought at once to kill; But he recoiling, with a little Pains, Soon reft it from him, then dang out his Brains, The Captain syne he in the Throng did meet, And with the Staff soon laid him at his Feet. His Men pursuing, slaughter'd all the Lave; No Men at Arms they order'd were to save. Women and Bairns he would not doom to die, But let them safely pass, unhurt and free. The Gold and Wealth the Soldiers Prey became; But Wallace sought for Scotland, and for Fame. Sojourning here Four Days the val'rous Crew, Upon the Fifth, Northward their March pursue. The Teth they cross'd, and the clear-running Ern, The Motions of their Southeron Foes to learn; In Methwin Forrest chuse their next Retreat And for the Hunting there had Store of Meat. Wallace was pleas'd, he now a Place had found, Where for his Men Provisions did abound; Where now at Rest refresh themselves they might, Nor more be forc'd at once to fast, and fight. Yet for himself no dainty Fare he sought, So did his Country's Cares possess his Thought; But wet, or dry was still with him the same, And Cold and Hunger welcome, if they came. So did he grieve for Scotland's woful Case; And such his Hatred to the Southeron Race. CHAP. II. How WALLACE past to Saint-Johnstoun, slew the Captain, and won Kinclevin. Now Wallace grieving idle thus to be Resolv'd at length Saint-Johnstoun for to see. Seven Men went with him graith'd in Armour clear; The rest he left to Steen of Ireland's Care. Changing his Name he Entrance soon obtain'd; Oft heard himself miscall'd, and sore disdain'd. But well dissembling his Intent, he chose At a young Maiden's Mansion to live close; A gentle loving Creature, mild and meek, Who often squeez'd his Hand, and clap'd his Cheek. From her he learn'd how Things with Southerons went; For ay to do them Skaith his Will was bent. Butler, he heard, an Aged cruel Knight, Kinclevin kept, a Castle wondrous Wight. Glad of the Tale, he straight way did repair To Methwin Wood, among his Comerades there. Syne drew them up, and march'd in good Array Along the green and bonny Banks of Tay. Approach'd the Castle silently and slow, That of his coming Southerons might not know. But they within, fearful of sudden Harms, Were quickly all a stir, and up in Arms. Then did a fierce and cruel Fight ensue, As ever was maintain'd among so few. But Wallace still the foremost of the Fray, Soon gave the English Loons right Scots-Man's Play. Oft did he pierce their Battel thro' and thro', And at each Onset many hack'd and slew. Butler himself came Wallace to withstand; But who could grapple Wallace Hand to Hand? Sore did the Knight the rash Adventure rue; For with one Stroke his Head in sunder flew. Their Chiftain slain, the Remnant English fled, Behind them leaving Threescore Soldiers Dead. The Castle yielding, after some short stay, They set on Fire, then brought their Gear away. Syne Wallace wisely all his Men withdraws; And lodges safely in the Short-Wood Shaws. CHAP. III. SHORT-WOOD Shaws. The English then that in Saint-Johnstoun lay, Soon hearing of this fierce and fatal Fray, Vowing Revenge, a Thousand Men of War Sent tow'rds the Wood, right awful in Effeir. These partly Sir John Butler did command A valiant Chief, as any in the Land, Seeking on Wallace well aveng'd to be, Who at Kinclevin caus'd his Father die. The like sought Loran, who from Gowrie came; For th'Umquhile Sir James Butler was his Eme. Into the Shaw their Men came pouring in, Archers, and Spearmen, with a dreadful Din. But Wallace undismaid, so plac'd his Crew Best to defend themselves, for they were Few. Then did a fell and bloody Stour begin, As scarce before on Tay was ever seen. Such Deeds were wrought, as truly 'twere a Crime, Them to descrive in our unlearned Rhime. How Arms met Arms, and Swords went clishy clash, For rural Lays to sing would be too rash. Of Wallace is my chief Intent to speak; Much did he toil, and oft their Ranks did break. Upon young Butler lighting at the length, Against him sole he guided all his Strength; A manful Stroke at him then letting flee, Defended underneath a bowing Tree, The Branch came down so weighty on his Head, As in an Instant fell'd the Chiftain Dead. Loran to see his Friend so fall was woe, So flew on Wallace an enraged Foe. But he, defending with his awful Blade, Dead at his Feet the doughty Younker laid. The worthy Scots did nobly all that Day, And drove their Foes with Shame at length away. Seven of their Number fell in Fight no more; But of the Southeron Race at least Six-score. Now fearing least their Foes should gather new Recruits, and them with num'rous Bands pursue, To Methwin Wood they went e're it was dark, And thence retreated into Elchoke Park. CHAP. IV. How WALLACE was sold to the English-Men by his Leman. Here while they tarry'd Wallace took a Bee Into his Head that Maiden for to see, Of whom we spoke before; a Friar's Gown He to disguise his Personage puts on; Then hies him to Saint-Johnstoun might and main; To meet the Dame he was so wondrous fain. There having past a Night, in wanton Play, He made a Tryst, to come another Day. Mean Time the Southerons did corrupt the Maid With Gold, to have him when he came, betray'd. According to his Tryst, he came in haste, Incontinent into her Chamber past. What they did there, who reads, may rightly spell; And certes 'twere unmeet for me to tell. Their Dalliance past, it smote the Damsel's Mind, To lose a Love so trusty and so kind. With bitter Wailings then to him made known The Case, and pray'd him quickly to be gone. Her Crime he pardon'd with a loving Kiss, Wip'd off her Tears, nor took her Fault amiss. Then straight way putting on her Female Weed, Betakes him to the Gate with utmost Speed. Past unsuspect by all the Watch, but Twain, Who wonder'd much at such a sturdy Queen. Him they pursu'd till getting out of Cry, He faces him about, their Strength to try; Pulls out a Brand, was hid beneath his Weed, And laid upon them, till they both were Dead. Then hastes him to his Men he left behind, Such Hazard is in trusting Woman-kind. The End of the Fourth Book. The Fifth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace How WALLACE escaped out of St. Johnstoun past to Elchock Park, and killed Fawdoun. How he past to Lochmabane. How WALLACE wan the Castle of Crawford, and killed the Captain thereof. Cold Winter now his hoary Aspect shows, Frost bound the Glyb whilst Boreas fiercely blows, Sweeping the Snow along the rising Hills, Which ev'ry Glen, and slanting Hollow fills: Cold grew the Beams of the far distant Sun, And Day was done ere it was well begun, Long, dark, and hateful was the gloomy Night, Uncomfortable to each banish'd Wight; Who durst not trust a Roof to hide their Head, But sculk from Hill to Hill with cautious Dread. Brave Wallace having plac'd his Sentries Right, Deem'd it not safe to leave his Hold that Night, For after his Escape full well he knew, His disappointed En'mies would pursue, And so it hapen'd. After they made search, Finding him gone they Arm'd and made their March, Amidst the Throng his subtile Miss with speed, Convey'd her self away, and sav'd her Head; Whilst they enrag'd, the South-Inch Way have tane, Where their Two Men they found by Wallace slain, Six hundred strong they were well Arm'd and Bold, Who round beset our Champion in his Hold; A Hound they had of wondrous bloody Scent, Would Trace the Slayer's Steps where e'er he went, A Guard she had. The rest the Wood beset, Looking on Wallace now as in a Net; Around the Strength Sir Gerard Heron lay, While with Three hundred Butler made his Way, Into the Wood, where Valiant Wallace stood, In shining Arms few were his Men but Good; Not one to Seven. Now past their Power to fly, Resolv'd to cut their Way or bravely Die; The hardy Chief, unsheath'd his conqu'ring Sword, Besought the Aid of Heav'n then gave the Word. Fiercely he met his Bold attacking Foes, And quick as Lightning dealt his fatal Blows; With horrid Din the temper'd Edges clash, On Coats of Steel, whence hasty Sparkles flash. But massie Armour, and deffensive Shield, Must to the nervous Arm of Wallace yield. Like a swoln Current, rushing from a Hill, Which does with Wreck the lower Valleys fill, Thus through the Martial Press he made a Lane, Who durst oppose, no sooner did than slain: Fourty of which infatuatly Bold, With gaping Wounds upon the Earth lay Cold; Thrice Five there fell of Scots Men Brave and True, Too great the Loss, when good Men were so few. Our Martial Heroe thus cuts out his Way, His Men with hasty Strides made toward Tay, Thinking to pass, but the Attempt was vain, Rather, said he, let's die upon the Plain. Than sink one single drop of Scotish Blood, Without Revenge in the relentless Flood. Then with new Courage, in Defence they stand, For Butler in Array was near at Hand, Baited in Blood, and panting for Revenge, Hast'ly they meet again and Deaths exchange; The youthful Captain of the Scots in ire, Us'd to the Wars, exerts his glorious Fire, Runs through the Croud, and Mows them down like Grass Whilst he unvulnerable stands like Brass, But many of his few with grief he 'spy'd, Whose gushing Wounds their Shields and Coats had dy'd, No way he thought on could bring them Relief, Unless the Downfall of the South'ron Chief; Him keen he sought thro' Throngs from Place to Place, Butler tho' bold declin'd to see his Face, Amidst strong Guards beneath an aged Oak, Evited at this Time the fatal Stroak Steven Ireland here, and faithful Kierly shew'd Their Valour Brave, and firm by Wallace stood; Upon the Ground, at this Bout Sixty more Of English slain lay welt'ring in their Gore; Nine more of Scots were of warm Life bereft And only Sixteen now with Wallace left, Who got clear off, whilst Butlers wearied Rout Confus'dly fled, 'twixt Parties they got out. The English Men not knowing where they went, Set the Sluth-hound upon the bloody Scent. With Nose a Ground closely she did pursue Till soon both Parties were in others view: The Enemy pursued on Coursers fleet, While the brave Scots depend on nimble Feet; Of rising Ground they had Two Miles in length Before they could arrive at any Strength, Good hope they had, for Day was nigh expir'd But to their grief ill-fated Fowden tyr'd: Wallace was loath to leave him on the Way Lest to aproaching Foes he'd fall a Prey, Urg'd him t'exert his Strength with Words of Love, But all in Vain no further would he move; The Chief enrag'd, his Sword with fury drew, And at one Stroak the lagging Traitor slew; Backward a lifeless headless Lump he lay, While the twinn'd Head babled its Life away. Just was the Act, he was a Villain found Useful in this. His Blood would stop the Hound Sure proof of Falshood, short way had they gone In prime of Years strong Muscles clad each bone. Him thus dispatch'd, Wallace his Foll'wers chears, Then sprung the Mountain swift as bounding Deers. Ireland mean time, and gallant Kierly stood Eastward of Dupline, in a scroggy Wood, By this the Stars were twinkling from on high From every opening of the cloudy Sky; Soon as the English came where Fawdon lay, The Blood-Hound ceas'd to tract the flyers Way; Nor farther mov'd, her Scent now being sunk, In this new Steam of Blood her Nose had Drunk; And now they deem'd that the despairing Scots Had fighting been, and cut each others Throats. Kierly and Steven unknown mixt with the Croud, That press'd about, and Faudon's Body view'd, And as Sir Gerrard bow'd to take a look, Kierly a Dagger in his Bosom struck, Beneath his Armour upward gave the Wound, And brought this Leader stagg'ring to the Ground. Soon as his Men the Accident espy'd, Treason around with mournful Shrieks they cry'd. Justly convinc'd that this audacious Blow, Was giv'n by Wallace' self, or such a Foe, 'Midst their Confusion, aided by the Gloom, The Two brave Scots escap'd impending Doom. With Grief and Madness Butler's Colour chang'd, While he saw gasping Heroun unreveng'd; Part of his Host he sent t'interr the Slain, Some to the Woods dispatch'd, some to the Plain, Whil'st he himself with a strong Party lay, To guard the Passes, till returning Day. Good Wallace ever careful of his Train, Missing his Two brave Men, was fill'd with Pain, For much he fear'd they taken were or slain After vain Search into the Wood he past, And safely at Gaskhall arriv'd at last: Flint gave 'em Fire, and Hunger made 'em Bold To take Two Wedders from a neigh'bring Fold, On which they sup'd. Mean while they heard a Blast, Of a loud Horn at which they stood aghast; Two were dispatch'd to learn who blew this Horn, And long they waited for the Spyes return. The Noise continu'd still and drew more near, The horrid Din disturb'd the Chiftain's Ear, Two more he sent. But none return'd again, Which fill'd his doubtful Mind with Rage and Pain. The other Nine he sent 'em, One by One, To find the Rest. Thus he was left alone. The Awful Sound increas'd still more and more, Louder and louder swell'd the dreadful Roar, Which made him tremble who ne'er shook before. But soon his dauntless Soul he did Collect, Then Sword in Hand with daring Front erect; Mov'd to the Gate. Where to his odd Surprize, The frightful Fawdon stood before his Eyes. Holding his bloody Head in his right Hand, Soon Wallace drew a Cross and made a stand. At him the Apparition threw its Head, Which Wallace caught up by the Hair with speed, And threw it back. But dreadful was his Fright, For well he knew it was some hellish Spright, Which mock'd his Sword. Strait up the Stairs he flew And soon himself out at a Window threw, Thence up the River hastily he ran, Never so frighted since he was a Man. Backward he turn'd his Eyes from whence he came, And thought he saw the Tower all in a Flame, While on the Top did frightful Fawdon stand With a prodigious Rafter in his Hand. But whether vested with compacted Air, In Fawdon's Shape some Dæmon did appear, Or, if the ling'ring Soul expell'd with Pain Strove to reanimate the Corpse again, Leave we to those who with unweary'd Eye, Explore the latent Depths of dark Philosophy. And now his Follow'rs lost, the mournful Chief Stood wilder'd in his Thoughts o'erwhelm'd with Grief Darkling he took his way depriv'd of Rest, While black Ideas rankled in his Breast. His Soul was in a Maze, nor could he find; What Heaven by this Misterious Scene design'd Yet still his Rage the distant En'my sought, And fierce Revenge boil'd up in every Thought. As thus he roam'd with clashing Doubts opprest That tore his Soul, and battel'd in his Breast; Gay Morn awakes, and with enliv'ning Ray Smiles on the World and Guilds the rising Day. Butler invited by the smiling Scene Forsook his Bed, and sought the Plains unseen, There view'd how pensive Wallace all alone Incessant sigh'd and made a piteous Moan; And rightly guessing that he was a Foe, Demands his Business with contracted Brow, Nor stop't. But spurring quick his fiery Horse With rapid haste precipitates his Course. Wallace unmov'd th'impetous Shock sustains, While awful Joy his gloomy Brow serenes. Strait rising to the Blow, he aim'd a Wound, And brought his En'my stagg'ring to the Ground, Now seiz'd his Horse, mounted, and with loose Reins, Forsook the Place and shot across the Plains. A Soldier view'd his hapless Leaders Fate. With ardent Eyes, and kind'ling into hate: Wing'd forth his Spear, that whistled in the Wind Drove o'er the Knight, and miss'd the Mark assign'd. But now the En'my with superiour Might, Beset the Roads, and intercept his Flight Collecting all himself, brave Wallace stood Saw how they rag'd and panted after Blood; And drew his Sword, that with tempestous Sway, Dealt Fate around and cut a sanguine Way, Three prostrate on the Plain, of Sense bereft, And stiff'ning unto Death the Victor left; The tainted Grass imbibes the flowing Blood, That gush'd amain and ting'd the ambient Flood. But as a Torrent with impetous Pride. From some steep Mountain pours its rapid Tide. Then swell'd by meeting Riv'lets rouls amain, With Ten fold roar, and Swallows up the Plain; So with successive Troops the Foe renew'd, Condense apace, and thicken to a Crowd, The Chief retires intrepid and serene, While Twenty Foes, unsoul'd adorn the fatal Scene, Fearless he inches back. His Sword on high Refulgent, flaming adverse to the Sky, Still ey'd his Enemies with greedy View, And Parthian-like, still wounded as he flew. And now the Foes no more Inflame the War, But roar in fainter Sounds and menace from afar. The panting Knight now eas'd from warlike Care, Reclines supine, and breaths the cooling Air. Now had the Night assum'd her still Command, And spread her sable Conquests o'er the Land; Darkness alone sat lowring all around, And more than Midnight Horrour cloath'd the Ground. Our Heroe weak and faint pursues his Way, Involv'd in Gloom, without one glimpse of Day. The dreary Wilds with Fens and Mire o'erspread, Retard his Passage and his Steps mislead. His Horse grown restive and o'ercome with Pain, Fell giddy to the Ground and press'd the Plain. Wallace on Foot toils out his lonesome Path, Now plung'd in Fens, now lost in rising Heath. Reviv'd by Heaven, at length to Forth he came, That thro' the Country Rouls its awful Stream. Circling it runs and with Majestick Pride, Into old Ocean dissembogues its Tide. Upon the gloomy Margin Wallace stood, Alone, and fearless plung'd into the Flood: With Nervous Arms he stems the surging Waves, Dashes the Tide, and all its Horrours braves. His well-try'd Sword cuts out a liquid Path, And guides his Course thro' watrie Scenes of Death. Fainting he made the Land; his Veins all chill'd With numbing Colds that thro' his Vitals thrill'd; For Winter now had tempested the Air, And with bleak Aspect Froze the aged Year. While the far distant Sun with slanting Ray, Obliquely Shone, and scarcely litt the Day. The Knight from Towns and Cities keeps aloof, Secure beneath a Widow's lowly Roof: Who with a lib'ral Hand reliev'd his Wants. Fonded his Breast, and sooth'd his bursting Plaints. To needful Rest he now applys his Head. But first the Maid dispatch'd with cautious Dread, To view Gaskhall that burning seem'd of late, To trace his Followers, and learn their Fate. Now coming Sleep spreads all her balmy Charms, And clasps the Heroe in her silken Arms, Within a darksome Wood securely laid The Shrubs his Pillow, and the Grass his Bed: Attending, the kind Widow's Sons stood near, And Guard his Slumbers with officious Care. A Priest beheld the Chief compos'd to Rest, Drew near, and thus his puny Fears exprest, Behold the Patriot now, whose puissant Hand, Must rid us of the Foe, and free our Land! Alas! good Ventrous Youth how weak he lies, Expos'd to raging Storms and wintrey Skies, Trembling he sleeps, and verging on Despair, Obnoxious now to every Female Snare. The Chief wak'd at the Sound, flung up enrag'd, I'm not he cry'd, so feebly equipag'd. My Arm and Fortitude assert my Right, And all my honest Actions dare the Light. While Scotland's wrongs edge keen my well try'd Sword I'll never poorly own a forreign Lord. And thou Inglorious Priest untouch'd remain, And owe thy Life alone to my Disdain. He said. And with his Nephew turn'd aside Recounting how he plough'd the foamy Tide Dark and alone; while his poor ebb of Blood That flow'd amain distain'd the Chrystal Flood And how to finish all his other Woes His Men had fallen a prey to cruel Foes. The Priest o'erhearing cry'd, dear Son behold How Heaven confirms what I but now foretold. Thy Friends are lost, thy self aloof from Aid To all th'Assaults of Fortune open laid, Forbear to tempt thy Fate, give up thy Sword And own great Edward for thy rightful Lord. No more. Fierce Wallace stern'd his Brow and cry'd My Life alone shall the long Strife decide, Thy tainted Words Venom the ambient Air; Cut thro' my Soul and aggravate my Care. My Countreys Wrongs cry for Revenge aloud And this good Sword is keen. It thirsts, for Blood And only can be sated with a Flood. But while he spake, with hasty Strides drew near Ireland and Kierly, still to Wallace Dear. As Sorrow late a Sovereign Sway possest, Smiles kindle in each Cheek and Joy in every Breast! While the vast Pleasure that each Aspect wears Too big for Words, now vents it self in Tears: The Chief beheld the Scene of grateful Woe, And now his kindly Show'rs with theirs united flow. The wond'rous Friends their dubious Fate review, And with amusing Talk prolong the Interview. How they had mingled Heroun with the Slain, And unobserv'd escap'd the fatal Plain. By this came back the Servant and reveal'd, What Dismal Scenes she every where beheld. How goary Corses strew'd the Purple Ground, And Death in bloody Triumph stalk'd around. No longer here the Heroe would remain, But left the VVood with his small faithfull Train. And here the VVidow merits endless Fame. VVho chearful with her Sons to Wallace came, Both in the Bloom of Life and sprightly Youth, Endu'd with Courage, Loyalty and Truth; Them she made over to his guardian Care, To bear Fatigues, and learn the Arts of VVar. Brave Heroine with manly Virtue blest, Her Country drove the Mother from her Breast! The Chief set forth adorn'd with Arms and Horse, And held that Night to Dundaff-Heath his Course. Sir JOHN Graham then posses'd these Lands. An aged Knight, VVho with reluctance own'd Tyrannick Might, But now alas! in his last Ebb of Life, He liv'd aloof from Glorious Feats of Strife, His Arm no longer could the Fauchion wield, Nor Shine in fulgent Arms, and Sun the Field. A Son he had with every Grace endu'd, Youth, Honour, Gallantry and Fortitude: His Country's VVelfare triumph'd in his Breast, Tinctur'd each Thought, and all his Soul imprest. Him the Old Sire, with ceremonial Care, On his good Sabre drawn oblig'd to Swear. “The rugged Paths of Honour still to tread, “VVherever Wallace and his Virtue lead.’ Three Times the Night renew'd her gloomy Reign, VVhile here the gallant VVarriour did remain. As the fourth Morn her purple Charms Displays, And paints the Cheek of Day with orient Rays. The Chief set out, his Pupil by his Side, Propos'd among his Friends with him to Ride. Wallace yet conscious of his recent Fault, How into Jeopardy his Men he brought. Deny'd the Suit, untill his better Care, Could with new Force of Arms revive the VVar. Now to Kilbank he bent his Course apace, In Martial Pomp, and quickly reach'd the Place. The Knight to every Soul a welcome Guest, Enjoys the Love of all, and fills each Breast. His Nephew here Resides in Bloom of Years, And chearful Gladness in his Aspect wears. Mean while th'unwelcome News to Piercie came, Of our Young Heroe's Acts and growing Fame. How with a Run of Conquests he had slain, His Foes, and all their Cities storm'd and ta'en: Asper in Speech and swell'd with vengeful Spite, Piercie demands what shelter held the Knight? And sure, cry'd out, wou'd he his Warfare cease, Acknowledge Edward, and accept of Peace. Soon might our King with unresisted Sway, Thro' Scotia's bleeding Vitals urge his Way, Wallace would quickly tame the rugged North, Inspire our Men and call their Courage forth. But still his Rage a cruel Rancour feeds, And bursts in winged Thunder on our Heads. Sages Illumin'd with interiour Light, Who search the Depths of Fate immers'd in Night, These have foretold, how Wallace great in Arms, Shall fill our Plains with War and fierce Alarms. The Chief mean while with active thoughts employ'd A Messenger dispatch'd to Blair and Boyd. Fame catch'd the News, and spread the welcome Sound In buzzing Whispers quickly all around: His Friends conveen apace, in gath'ring Swarms, Enur'd to War and bred to Feats of Arms. But Blair above the rest for Learning fam'd, The first Place in our Heroe's Bosom claim'd: With early Infancy their Love began. And grew as ripening Youth shot up to Man, Thus Danc'd the rosie Minutes and the Chief, Securely liv'd at Large, remote from Grief: His Transports now run high, his Cares decrease, And every Hour is mark'd with smiling Ease. His Friends with chearful Looks his Orders wait, And all his Wants well pleas'd anticipate. But now far diff'rent Cares engross his Soul, And all the manly Rage of War controul. Love bound the Heroe in his Flow'ry Chains; For over all the GOD unbounded Reigns. In Lanerk dwelt the Fair. Well known to Fame, For matchless Beauties crown'd the charming Dame. Now in her Spring of Life, she grew apace, Spreading to Bloom, and crown'd with every Grace. The Syrens with perswasive Eloquence, Charm'd from her Lips and beautify'd her Sense, While Piety adds Lustre to her Name. Wallace beheld and own'd the pleasing Flame The Print of Love new-stamp'd his ductile Breast, And with soft Characters his Soul Imprest. As Waves impell'd by Waves, his Mind is tost, And in the spreading Sea of Passion lost, Love Tears his Bosom, shoots along his Veins, And a wild Anarchy of Thoughts Maintains: Now with fresh warmth his martial Flames awake, And he th'ignoble Chain attempts to break. The Fair arises now in all her Charms, And with soft Fires his languid Bosom warms, The youthful Knight impatient of his Wound, VVith strange Disorder rouls his Eyes around Try's every Mean and strives to quell the Smart That tore his Breast and stung his bleeding Heart. Now maz'd in Doubts, and with strange Tumults fill'd, The Lover thus his secret Pangs reveal'd. What shall I then give up my Breast to Joy, And all my Schemes of future Wars Destroy? Shall I thus lose my self in pleasing Dreams, While Scotia's welfare all my Bosom claims? No. Thus I stifle the inglorious Flame, And raze the Image of the beauteous Dame: Rise Glory Rise! Assume thy wonted Charms, And take me panting to thy sanguine Arms, I'll drown each Thought of her in War and loud Alarms. ‘Kierly Beheld how the young Warriour strove ‘In vain to quell th'unruly Pangs of Love, ‘How obstinately good, he scorn'd to know, ‘All but the Dear unhappy Countrey's woe. ‘No chearing Bless gilds o'er his Gloom of Cares, ‘No sprightly Joys his anxious Bosom shares, ‘Fain would the Friend his Dreary Cares beguile, ‘When thus he answer'd with an artful Smile. ‘And what can Wound the strictest Patriot's Name, ‘By wedding Vertue in so fair a Dame? ‘Since all your Thoughts imprest by Love arise, ‘Enjoy the Maid bound yours in nuptial Ties. ‘She's Chast and Vertuous, Innocent and Good; ‘Nor can her Lineage ever stain your Blood. ‘Ungen'rous Man, reply'd the wondring Chief, ‘And wouldst thou have me dissipate my Grief? ‘While Scotland weeps, weeps out her dearest Blood, ‘And floats to Ruine down the crimson Flood. ‘Th'important Now, decides her future State, ‘And see the Scales are hung to weigh her Fate. ‘While we're the only Friends that she can boast, ‘To counterpoize a hardy numerous Host. ‘Our every Thought in such an Enterprize, ‘Or big with Conquest or with Death should rise. ‘And sure while Scotia's Enemies remain, ‘Unnerving Love should ever sue in Vain. ‘And what is Love? ‘Nothing but Folly, Glaring Emptiness, ‘Effeminate and froathy all its Bless; ‘A fleeting Joy. Sure then it cannot be, ‘That Love and War at once should reign in me. ‘Yet Love they say our brutal Rage disarms. ‘Refines our Ardour and our Courage Warms. ‘But that is only when the fair One's kind, ‘When blooming Hopes distend the Lovers Mind. ‘When Bless and beauteous Conquest stand confess'd, ‘And Life redoubled heaves within his Breast, ‘But when the Virgin nought but Frowns bestows ‘Nor hears his am'rous Plaints or dying Vows: ‘'Tis then his very Manhood melts away ‘In Tears by Night, and mournful Sighs by Day. ‘No more his Breast the sprightly Trumpet charms, ‘No more he joy's in War and shining Arms. ‘Our Nation groans beneath a Load of Woes, ‘And calls on us against her cruel Foes, ‘And could such Conduct suit a Warriour's Mind ‘(For Women are Unconstant or Unkind) ‘Who before Man, and Heaven's all-seeing Eye ‘Must bravely conquer, or as bravely die, ‘The Warriour spoke with Indignation spoke, ‘While Anger from his Eyes like Lightning broke, ‘Yet in his Bosom Love the Tyrant play'd, ‘And laugh'd secure at what his Fury said. ‘The Chief at last perceiv'd with anxious Pain, ‘That still imperious Love maintain'd his Reign, ‘What could he do? With outmost Care he strove, ‘Now to oppose, and now to fly from Love ‘In vain. The God still with the Angler's Skill ‘Or mock'd his Force, or play'd him to the full. ‘Kierly beheld how Love his Strength defies ‘Battles his Soul, and triumphs in his Eyes, ‘And whil'st the Chief who ne'er before had sigh'd ‘Groan'd with a Load of Grief, he fondly thus reply'd ‘Why does my Lord create Himself this Pain, ‘Why strive with Love, yet ever strive in vain, ‘Give up the Conquest, dissipat thy Care. ‘Make way for Bless, and for the lovely Fair: ‘The Fair makes all the Heroe's Rage refin'd, ‘New-Strings his Arm and chears his drooping Mind. ‘While in his Soul the awfull Goddess Reigns, ‘A double Life his Bosom knows, a double Life his Veins ‘This said, th'Advice with tender Zeal express'd, ‘With poyson'd Steps stole silent to his Breast, ‘And Joy unbidden all his Soul possest. ‘Meanwhile with ebbing Force as thus he strove, ‘To stem the Rage of Fierce prevailing Love. ‘A Maid approach'd who from the Fair one came, ‘(For Love had fir'd her Breast with hidden Flame) ‘And brought this Message from the beauteous Dame. ‘Miranda sends, to honest Fame well known, ‘Fond to behold her Countrey's bravest Son, ‘The Chief amaz'd, impatient of Delay, ‘I go he cry'd, and bad her urge the Way. ‘Thro' secret Paths they went and shunn'd the Town, ‘And reach'd the House secure, perceiv'd by none. ‘While she severely good and wond'rous Kind, ‘Wish'd for his safe Approach with anxious Mind. ‘The Lovers met, and now a modest Kiss, ‘Lifts up the Heroe's Soul to laughing Bless. ‘Love feels th'Alarm, starts up in fond surprise, ‘And thro' his Veins, anew Impetous flies, ‘Inflames his Soul, and sparkles thro' his Eyes, ‘His sparkling Eyes that gently rolling play'd, ‘In her's beheld bright Virgin-love betray'd. ‘And whilst a Blush that redden'd on her Face, ‘Paints out a modest Flame with rosy Grace. ‘Screw'd to the highest Strain of Bless his Soul, ‘Could scarce th'impetous Tide of Joy controul, ‘But all was still, and all was calm around, ‘When thus the Syren spoke in nectar'd Sound. ‘I own indeed I Love, nor Blush to tell, ‘The Man that loves my Countries Peace so well. ‘And would be fond e'en with my Life to please, ‘The Chief that bravely scorns inglorious Ease. ‘While Scotia Calls, ‘Alas how much she needs, unhappy now! ‘So good a Warriour and a Friend as you. ‘Her bravest Sons by cruel Foes are slain, ‘And few her Friends, ah hapless Friends remain! ‘Even while I speak I scarce can boast an Hour, ‘Or of my Life or Honour in My Pow'r. ‘The loving Chief return'd, Oh Maid Divine! ‘Your bleeding Wrongs the glorious Cause shall join. ‘And whilst the thundring Battle loudest Rings, ‘And Thousand Deaths appear on fatal Wings: ‘Inflam'd by am'rous Rage, and aiding Love, ‘[illeg.] [illeg.] himself thro' groaning Bands I'll move. ‘And whilst the Thoughts of thee wing every Blow, ‘How well I love the gasping Wretch shall know. ‘But by yon awful Heavens had not my Mind, ‘With hopeless Scotia 'gainst her Foes Combin'd. ‘I'd never leave thee by th'immortal Powrs, ‘My Soul would mix and lose it self in yours. ‘Yet next to God and to my Countrey's Care, ‘You all my Thoughts and all my Breast shall share. ‘With fond Discourse thus talk'd they out the Day, ‘While Hours well pleas'd to hear, croud Hours away. ‘Till Wallace saw the Night on high display'd, ‘And with Reluctance left the weeping Maid. With heavy Heart he held the dreary Way, And join'd his Friends that wondred at his stay. Now from the Fair remov'd, our Heroe strove, By Warfare to divert the Pangs of Love. Fir'd with the Thought, he choaks the rising Sigh, And fondly hopes the distant Enemy, Who in Lochmabane lorded it secure, Full grown in Arrogance and flush'd with Pow'r, Clifford inhumane Youth bore Chief Command. And spread his cruel Conquests o'er the Land. Now Wallace scarce had reach'd the guilty Town, (Conceal'd his Name, his Country only Known) When swell'd with Malice, Clifford sought the Place, And brands the Scots and loads them with Disgrace: Appriz'd the Knight, pursues the haughty Lord, Th'Afffront lent Weight and Fury to his Sword; Urg'd home the Thirsty Fauchion sought his Side, Transpierc'd his Heart, and drunk the vital Tide. Sated the Chiftain left the Town. And now, Wing'd with revengeful Spite his Foes pursue; The Knight serene thus warn'd his faithful Friends, “Behold the raging En'my this way tends, “Leave we the Plains, and yonder Thickets climb, Trusting th'Event to Providence and Time. His Friends reluctant hear the strict Command, Sternly retire, and Eye th'approaching Band. By this with hasty Strides the Foe drew near; Their burnish'd Arms reflect a Gleam severe: With fulgent Light they shone. The steely Blaze, Shot full against the Sun with mingling Rays. Their Arrows now with certain Speed they aim'd, And wounded Blair, for Wit and Valour fam'd. Wallace beheld him bleed, and fir'd to Rage, Turn'd instantly, in Order to Engage. His little Band in dubious War well try'd, Rush on the num'rous Foe with gen'rous Pride. And now with adverse Shock the Warriours met, Each urg'd the Fight, nor thought of base Retreat: The South'ron Army thinn'd with num'rous slain, In Multitudes lay grov'ling on the Plain. But still in gath'ring Crouds, new Troops advance, The Fields resound, the Neighing Coursers prance. Moreland, the Flower of Arms moves to the Field, Lightning his Eyes, his Arms keen Splendor yeild. His waving Plume nods terribly from far, And whitens with its Foam the Tide of War. With boiling Rage his heaving Bosom Glows, And Martial Terror glooms upon his Brows. The English rais'd to Hope, their Chief survey, And meditate the Ruine of the Day. In Vain the the Dauntless Scots attempt to fly, Closs wedg'd they stand, resolv'd to win or die. And now both Sides assault, and proudly Vie; Thickens the Combat, and resounds the Sky, Wallace distinguish'd by his orby Shield, Rode thund'ring thro' the Tempest of the Field. Where Moreland rag'd; and with a pond'rous Blow, Full on his Neck, divides the Bone in Two. No more the Joints the dizzy Head sustain, The haughty Chief rush'd head-long to the Plain. Seizing his Horse the Knight, with active Care, Revives again the the Thunder of the War: Inspir'd from Heaven with more than humane Might, His Arm alone enclines the Scale of Fight. Around, the verdant Grass is Sanguine Dy'd, And Heaps on Heaps expire on every Side. The English now, their Chiftain lost, give way Deadned with Fear and fall an easy Prey; Now to the Town their rapid Steps they bend. Throng to the Castle and in haste ascend. Their hagar'd Eyes their inward Fears disclose, And look a Voice, and speak their direful Woes. Graystock their Gen'ral here at ease resides, Who scorns their Terrours and their Fears derides, And now his Soldiers arm'd, the Fort he leaves, And with fresh Powers the fainting War revives. Wallace mean while the bloody Scene had left, With Victory, nor of one Friend bereft. And clad in Arms he shot an Iron Light; The En'my saw, and curs'd the unwelcome Sight. Oh Don't, they cry'd, our Doom anticipate, Return, nor brave th'impending burst of Fate. Yonder behold! the Valiant God-like Knight. Whose mighty Arm alone lays waste the Fight. Ha Dastards! cry'd the Gen'ral with a Frown, His Strength owes Being to your Fears alone, And spurr'd his Horse. Now Wallace from afar. Beheld th'encreasing Tumult of the War; Nor could he tempt the Storm, that with new roar, Roul'd dreadful, menacing his Scanty Pow'r And now o'rcome with Toil, his Horse gave o'er. Mean Time dispatch'd by Heaven, immortal Grahame, Back't with his Friends, a brave Retinue came, Thrice Ten he led, a small but faithful Train, Each could mark red the Field with num'rous slain, And the whole Tempest of the War sustain. The Battle joins. And Clamours, Shouts and Cries, Ring thro' the Plains, and tear the vaulted Skies. Grahame now with ardent Eyes his Friends survey'd, And sent to every Quarter timely Aid. Himself mean while from Place to Place engag'd, Where the Storm roar'd, and where the thickest rag'd, Rush'd thro' the War that bled in every Vein, Like some fierce Tide, and sweep't the standing Plain. Wallace on Foot cuts out a sanguine Path, And stems the Flood of War, and braves impending Death. Restless he fights, with Blood and Dust besmear'd, Reaping the Field, where nought but Fate appear'd. And thus th'intrepid few still urge their Course, Each in himself, a War, an Armies Force. But now the Foe repuls'd with foul Disgrace, (Their Champion in the Front) retreat apace, While Wallace yet unweary'd urg'd the Chace. Before him Grahame Active as Lightning flew, Mix'd with the Crou'd, and all Promiscous slew. The Knight beheld, and check'd his vulgar Rage, That stoop'd with the low Rabble to Engage. Away, he cry'd, nor thus disgrace thy Sword, Yon flying Chiefs will nobler Stores afford, He said. The youthful Heroes shoot along, With rapid haste and reach the distant Throng. Fierce Graystock now abandon'd by his Pride, Nought but Despair appear'd on every Side. Grahame sought the haughty Chief. And now on high, His Sword that Flam'd and lighten'd in the Sky. With whirl-wind Sound descends, and cleaves his Head; No force of Motion could the Stroke impede: The yauning Chasm well'd out a purple Flood, Forth rush'd the Soul effus'd with gushing Blood. Wallace mean while dealt Ruine all around: And with dead Corses strew'd the blushing Ground: The En'my still experienc'd his Pow'r, And those who felt his Arm harass'd the Scotch no more. The Chace now finish'd, the brave Warriours meet, And with kind intercourse of Souls unite. The Knight well pleas'd his panting Friends espies, With Joy his Bosom glows, with transports glut his Eyes, His Visage roughn'd into Frowns e'er while. Assumes the softer beauties of a Smile, Fair Victory sat blooming on his Head, And all around her, sacred Blessings shed. But now the Sun roul'd down the fading Light, Red Vesper took his Post. Arose the Night. On Hills of Slain the Scarlet Heroes sate, Pond'ring new Toils of War in close Debate. Pale Scotia still her bleeding Veins display'd, And pointing to the Foe, and call'd aloud for Aid. Fir'd with her Wrongs and with new Anger fraught, They steel their Hearts, and bar each milder Thought; Nor sated with the Vengeance of the Day, To Lochmabane directly take their Way. And now to aid their Rage a Night of Shades, Muffles the Sky, and the pale Moon invades. No Stars appear'd in the dark Firmament, As if their everlasting Oil were spent: Lone Midnight silence quell'd each whispring Sound, And spread his gloomy Pinions all around. Conceal'd the wary Spies rode on before, The destin'd Town in Order to explore. With Darkness velop'd, soon they reach'd the Gate, Where watching all alone the Keeper sate, With silent Rage they aim'd a random Wound, And laid the Felon prostrate on the Ground. The following Band came on with hasty Pace. Breathing Revenge, and quickly made the Place. The gleanings of the Field they here surprise, Resounds the House with Clamour, Shrieks and Crys, While Terror wildly peeps forth from their Eyes. Nought but the groans of Wretches now is heard, Where Mirth and ill-timed Riot Late appear'd. 'T was now past Ebb of Night, and dawning Morn, Appear'd on infant Smiles and Blushes born; The Victors now quite spent with Toils of War, Give o'er, and, panting breath the fragrant Air. Reclin'd they gladly take a short Repast, To satiate Nature's Call, not please the Taste. That done, with gen'rous Wine they brim the Bowl, Each quaffs and sucks the Nectar to his Soul: The dancing Tide rouls thro' each languid Vein, And swells them with o'erflowing Streams again. Sated at length they leave the humbled Town. The Fortress taken, and their Foes o'erthrown, And bent their Course to where impetous Clyde, Thro' Precipices pours its foamy Tide. With many wandring Rouls the circling Stream, The Pride of Rivers, and the Poets Theme. Now grateful Slumber creeps o'er all apace, And fonds their Senses with a soft Embrace. Within a darksome Vale retir'd they lay, At ease from all the busy Toils of Day: Thro' every Limb the soft Infection Crept, And Guardian Angels watch'd 'em as they slept. A Fort remain'd, where fill'd, with Rage and Spite, The En'my rul'd and triumph'd in their Might. While thus secure the slumbr'ing Warriours lay, VVild Fancy now assumes Internal Sway: Still to their sleeping Thoughts the Fort arose, And hag'd their Dreams, and shook them from Repose. Th' inverted Scale of Heav'n now weigh'd up Night Sunk was the Sun, and faded was the Light. Walking at length, unseen they leave the Vale, The fated Place determining t'Assail. Wallace before the rest went forth alone, With eager Speed, and reach'd the guilty Town. And here a hideous Noise insults his Ear, Of drunken Mirth, unlike the Voice of War. Enrag'd, the Chiftain gave the order'd Sign, His Friends throng in and all their Powers combine. With active Care the Gates they first possest, Then guard the Passes and the Strength invest. Wallace first sought the House, inflam'd with Hate When sunk in Luxury the Captain sate. Unsheath'd his Sword, and aim'd a certain Blow, That hurl'd to Shades of Night th'abandon'd Foe. With equal Rage he gave to Fate the rest, And mingled with their Blood their horrid Feast. Their mangled Bodies strew'd the sanguine Floor, Grinning in Death, and weltring in their Gore. Mean Time without Graham plies the lofty Fort, Built up of Beams and fortify'd by Art. Strait flung Triumphant from his thundring Hand, Full to the steepy Roof a flaming Brand: The Red Contagion blazing flew along, With crackling roar, and scorch'd the trembling Throng. And now the ruddy Ruine whirls on High, Swells in the Wind, and triumphs to the Sky. Wild Shrieks within and yellings of Despair, A blended Horrour! rends the midnight Air. And now the Turret, Ground, and all around, With burst of Thunder tumbled to the Ground It fell. And crush'd the Wretches underneath, With wild Destruction whelm'd and fiery Death. Soon as the radiant Morn renew'd the Day, The Victors, on each Side the Place survey, That now in smoaking Heaps and Rubbish lay, The Works that stood they levell'd with the Ground, And spread a gen'ral Ruine all around. The Sixth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. ARGUMENT. Winter being pass'd, and the Summer advancing, Wallace returns again to Lanerk; to visit his Mistress, (an Account of the first beginning of his Passion, is to be found in the Fifth Book) where meeting with a kind Reception, he marrys her. BUT the English during that Time he had spent in his Courtship, having occupied and taken Possession of all the Forts and Towns in SCOTLAND, oblig'd him to rise again in Arms to vindicate his Country. But before he took the Field, he thought it necessary to remove his Wife from the Hazard of the War, which occasions a moving Colloquy betwixt them, she earnestly imploring him to take her along with him, and he declaring to her the ill Effects of it. The Morning arriving, Wallace goes out to the Fields, where having implor'd Heaven for the Success of his Undertaking, he blew his Horn to call his Followers he had with him together; where discovering his Intent, they all with one Consent agree to the War, and make Preparations for it. The English perceiv'd their Intent, and under the Command of Hesilrig and Thorn make Head against them, and the Scots overpower'd with Multitudes, retreated to Cartlane-Craigs. The Night approaching, Hesilrig insulting Wallace's Wife, most barbarously kills her, when behold Wallace after expressing his Sorrow for her Loss, resolves to revenge it, and coming back in the Night-Time, slew Thorn, Hesilrig, and the English-Men in Lanerk. This being told King Edward, he gathered together a great Army and came to Bigger, where Wallace being now join'd with a considerable Number met him, and encouraging his Men, Fought and defeat them, but the English being told by Spies, that the Scots had intoxicated themselves with the Wine left in the Camp, returned and were again defeat. After this, Wallace took in a Castle on a Rock, and with continued Debates, so weakned the English, that they were content at Rutherglen Kirk, to conclude a Peace for a Year, that both shou'd rest from committing any Hostilities. CHAP. I. Now had cold February spent its Store, And Boreas rushing Blasts offend no more; No more the Hurricane embroils the Deep, And driving Winds on its smooth Surface sleep: No more the Plains in standing Lakes appear, And March had spent the Winter of the Year. Now April joyous Mouth; its Course begun, And hoary Snows now melted to the Sun, A springing Verdure crowns the happy Land, And smiling Nature own'd rhe Summer's Hand. While thus the Earth smiles in its Gayity, And Summer Weeds adorn each springing Tree: The busy Nymphs renew their annual Toil, And build their Grott's perfum'd with Balm and Oil, Each blythsome Hour, in Ranks they dance along, And the pleas'd Hunter listens to their Song. In this blest June when all conspir'd to move, His manly Soul with the soft Flame of Love, Our Knight to Lanerk went of new again, Seiz'd with the Pangs of his returning Pain, He runs with Joy to meet his lovely Fair, Nor reck'd he of his English Foes since she was there: The subtile Flame feirce roll'd within his Breast, Hot in his Pain he thought ne'er one so blest. Sometimes the Thought of Conquest wou'd return, And fierce Ambition in his Bosom burn; His Country's Glory rise before his sight, And Love's soft Joys yeild to the Toils of Fight; At other Times, Love wou'd usurp again, Fair Glory's Charms decay, and War subside again. Shall I no more hear the fierce Battles rage, No more in bloody Fields my Foes engage, Shall Love's imperious Powers thus controul My easy Heart, and move my pliant Soul: What Plague is this? This Bane of Mortals Love? That me from Arms of Glory wou'd remove. My Honour calls, and nothing e're shall make, Me lose my Honour for my Pleasure's sake; To War I will, and shine in Arms again, And Love shall spread its Silken Chains in Vain. While thus the Heroe spent his anxious Life, And Love and Honour held the doubtful Strife, Alternate Passions rul'd his wav'ring Mind, And now to this, and now that inclin'd. At last resolv'd to finish all his Grief, And give his mourning Soul a sure Relief: To wed with holy Love the beauteous Dame, Give loose to his Desire, and quench the sacred Flame. And dow the Morning its fair Beams display'd, And Musick wakened into bless the Maid. Conubial Hymen wav'd his Torch on high, And bad their future Life, compleatest Joy; Now live in strictest Unity of Love, And for all jarring Dissonance remove; Let wing'd with Pleasure the soft Minutes flow, And lasting Bless no Interruption know. A rising Joy now dawns within his Breast, Of all that Heaven cou'd bestow possest: With Pleasure, now he runs his Dangers o'er, And Fortune's various Face offends no more; In her alone he places his Delight, And Joy arises from her only Sight: While with like Heat, her faithful Bosom warms, For in his Time he was the Flow'r of Arms; Thus blooming Love extends his soft Command, And joyful Hymen reigns with equal Hand. While now the Heroe far from Wars alarms, Enjoys all Pleasure in his Consort's Arms; His former Love of Glory fires again His Martial Soul, and prompts him to the Plain; To bear aloft again the Patriot Shield, And vindicate his Country in the Field: His burning Breast glows yet with Fields unfought, And future Triumphs rise upon his Thought. Now leave thy Mirth, and seek thy Country's Foes, Tho' round thy Head the gath'ring Battle glows Go leave thy Love or glorious Freedom lose. Which ne'er on Earth shall be Redeem'd again, Go live in War, go live in cruel Pain: And then just GOD, who does this World sustain, Let not this Thrist of Vengeance be in vain. Let Heav'n with due Success still crown the Just, And lay the proud Oppressor in the Dust. But now his faithful Wife, employs his Care, Expos'd to all the common Ills of War; Shou'd he by adverse Fate be forc'd to yeild, And to the Foe give up the vanquish'd Field: A Thousand sad corroding Cares infest, And Fate hangs gloomy on his anxious Breast. Far from the hoarse Noise of the thund'ring War, He wou'd remove the Object of his Care; But sad with Grief relents his bleeding Heart, And his Thoughts shrink, at the dread Word to part. 'Twas now the Time when all to Rest repair, And weary Wretches laid aside each Care; When with fond Arms the fair Fidelia prest, Her panting Heroe to her snowy Breast; With Grief she found the rising Tears bedew His manly Face, and heard the Sighs he drew: With frequent Sobs her heaving Bosom rose, And catch'd the dear Infection of his Woes; On her pale Cheeks does livid Paleness rise, And Sorrow speaks in Silence from her Eyes: Then with a Groan thus he, long I've supprest, The struggling Passion in my labouring Breast; But now all sad Restraints at once give way, Fierce Sorrow bids me speak, and I obey; Behold our Native Country drown'd in Tears, Around one general Face of Woe appears. In vain we're blest with kind indulgent Skies, And Suns in vain, with genial Ardor rise, In vain a yellow Harvest crowns the Plain, And nodding Boughs their golden Load sustain: The Peasant comfortless repining stands, And sees his Harvest reap'd by others Hands; See the fierce Soldier rages o'er the Land, The Flames wide spreading from the Hostile Hand: Those shining Spires who lately pierc'd the Sky, Now equal with the Ground in Ruins lye, O dire and curst Effects of Slavery. Yet once I nobly durst assert her Right, Bold in her Cause, and dauntless in each Fight; But now the useless Sword is laid aside, And my once faithful Helm long been untry'd, But now the Tyrants Pow'r we dare restrain, And Liberty shall rear her Head again: With fell Revenge another War prepare, Bend the long unstrung Bow, and launch the rusty Spear. But various Cares solicitat my Breast, Invade my Heart, and rob my Soul of Rest; While to my drooping Minds prophetick Eyes, A Thousand Griefs in fatal Prospect rise: Methinks I view the cruel raging Foes, End that dear Life to finish all my Woes. Methinks I see that sacred Blood now spilt, To fill up Hesilrig's black Scene of Guilt: And now to save thee from the coming Blow, And shield thee from the Malice of the Foe: I have prepar'd of Youth a chosen Band, Ready to march where e'er thou shalt command; Some well built Tow'r a hospitable Seat, Shall prove from Wars alarms a safe Retreat; There nor the Battles voice shall wound thy Ear, Nor the fierce Spoiler black with Guilt appear. There may thy constant Prayers bless my Sword, And waft thy kindest Wishes to thy Lord; Till circling Time bring back the happy Day, When Scotland shall be free from English Sway; Till her extended Plains be call'd her own, And yet a Scotish King ascend a Scotish Throne. He said and ceas'd, nor groan'd, but deep supprest, Each rising Passion in his manly Breast: But fiercer Grief her tender Heart assail'd, She wept, and the frail Woman all at once prevail'd. And will thou then she said, and wilt thou go, Where Thunders call thee, and where Battles glow, And leave me here expos'd to every Foe: See Hesilrig with lustful Rage appears, Derides my Passion, and insults my Fears. With hasty Steps he comes to be possess'd, Or stab his Poynar'd in my hated Breast; In vain with piteous Shrieks I fill the Air, And stung with Sorrow my bare Bosom tear, When he that shou'd Revenge me is not near. Hast thou forgotten how his ruthless Sword, In my dear Brother's Blood has deep been gor'd; Fir'd with bright Glory's Charms both met the Foe, And sunk beneath the mighty Warriors Blow; 'Tis true that fighting for their Country's Right, They glorious dy'd nor recreant left the Fight; That Thought indeed shou'd flowing Grief restrain, But Nature bids me, and I must complain. But say in vain is all this flow of Tears, Fantastick Passion, a weak Woman's Fears; No Hesilrig red with my Kindreds stain, No Friends destroyed, and no Brothers slain, Yet with her Wallace let his Consort go, Join with his Ills sad Partnership of Woe! Or if propitious Heaven shall dain to smile, With faithful Love reward my Heroe's Toil; What tho' my tender Nerves refuse to bend, The twanging Yew, and the fleet Dart to send; Round thy distinguish'd Tent, yet will I stay, And wait impatient the decisive Day: When Freedom on thy Helm shall crested stand, Nor Fortune linger with her doubtful Hand. But canst thou, thou wilt say endure Alarms, Hear Wars rough Voice, and the hoarse sound of Arms; When the big Drum, and sprightly Pipe prepare, In dreadful Harmony to speak the War. Then shall thy Breast with trembling heaving rise, And female Sorrow gather in thy Eyes; But let the Wars rude shock assaults my Ears, The Woman Wallace shall throw off her Fears, On this weak Breast shall Love new Force impress, Nor let that Doubt repel my Happiness. But whether can I go, or where Retreat, From following Vengeance and impending Fate; Even shou'd I go, where dreary Caves forlorn, Horrid with Night, exclude the joyous Morn: And lonely Hermits never cease to mourn. Yet wou'd keen Hesilrig find out the Place, And in my Ruin finish all my Race; What tho' the bounding Vessel waft me o're, To Lands remote, and some far distant Shoar; What tho' extended Tracts of Lands and Sea, Divide the War, and my dear Lord from me. The Wife of Wallace can't be long conceal'd, But soon by babling Fame shall stand reveal'd; Then take me with thee, what e're Chance betide, Firm to thy Cause, and honest I'll abide: Nor let me mourn, alone when I am left Of thee, and ev'ry Joy with thee bereft. She said and wept, nor yet his Sorrows rise, But awful Grief sits decent in his Eyes: Cease, cease he cry'd nor urge a vain Relief, Nor by thy lingring Doubts increase my Grief. Now if kind Heav'n shall bless my Enterprize, Nor Fate look on me with her envious Eyes: In flowing Ease, shall end our hated Strife, And Joy conduct us to the Verge of Life. But if just Heav'n shall otherwise ordain, 'Tis Heav'n that wills it—why shou'd we complain. Thus while the faithful Pair their Grief exprest, And sooth'd the Passions in each others Breast; The beateous Morn disclos'd its early Ray, And the gray East shone with the future Day. The Heroe rose, and with becoming Art, Feigns a false Joy, at the same Time his Heart, Was fill'd with Grief, which touch'd each tender Part. Then to the Fields he went with Sorrow fraught, While Thousand Woes surcharg'd each rising Thought. With Patriot groans he fills the Morning Air, And spreading both his Hands to Heav'n this was his Pray'r. Hear me kind Heav'n if still my Feet have trod, In Virtues Paths, nor devious from my God; Since first with Floods of Fears and constant Pray'r, My weeping Parents gave me to thy Care. When round my Head the Guardian Angels flew, And conscious Heav'n approv'd my little Vow: That if propitious Fate, increas'd my Span, And lengthned tender Childhood out to Man. My Country's Foes, shou'd always feel my Might, Nor my Sword sparkle in another Fight; Thence soon commenc'd my Woes, and hateful Strife. With War embroil'd my tender Years of Life. Oft has the Soldier, under my Command, From Slav'ry base, redeem'd his Native Land; But now opprest with Foes, we droop again, And panting Liberty forsakes the Reign Yet bold in Virtue's Cause, we nobly dare, To raise the sleeping Embers of the War; No impious Itch of Empire fires our Mind, Nor are our Hearts to those base Thoughts inclin'd: But our fierce Breasts glow with a holy Rage, Thine are the Fields we fight, and thine the War we wage But if Alass! Some unforseen Offence, Lies latent in the Book of Providence; For which the trembling Scot shall shameful fly, And leave the Field to his fierce Enemy; Then let me dye preventing all my Foes, And close these Eyes, nor see my Country's Woes. He ceas'd when he observed thro' the Sky, A strange prodigious Meteor to to fly; The Chief beheld it kindling as it flew, And from the Sight a happy Omen drew: And does consenting Heaven yeild he crys, And better Hours from better Omens rise. Now, now, the English shall the Danger fear, And trembling fly before the Scotish Spear. And now a growing Hope springs in my Mind, And leaves vain Jealousy and Fears behind; Then blew his Horn, well known in Wars alarms, To call the hardy Soldier to his Arms. To the shrill Notes Heav'n answers all around, And Scotia takes new Vigour from the Sound. Spreads wide the Noise and undulates on high, And reach the Soldiers where dispers'd they ly, Inflaming ev'ry Breast with love of Liberty. Now all around the Chief they listning stand, Each his keen Sabre threatning in his Hand, And eagerly devour his last Command. Enough my Friends, enough has Scotia born, The Foes insulting and her Sons forlorn. The trembling Peasant wild with dread Affright, Shrink from the Wars rude Shock and ruthless Fight. Resigns his Riches to the Oppressors Hand, And sees another's Sickle reap his Land. And long we not to urge our Fate again, Glows not each Breast, and swells not ev'ry Vein? Does not our Heart with love of Freedom burn, And once again our exil'd Souls return. Where are those Trophies by our Fathers won, Triumphs related down from Son to Son. Where is that Crown the first fam'd FERGUS bore, And that fierce Scepter stain'd in Pictish Gore. Should these old rev'rend Forms again rise, In mystic Vision dreadful to our Eyes. What sad Reproaches justly wou'd they give, To those who chuse in Bondage thus to live: How wou'd their Cheeks blush with a kindred Shame, And throw' us back the hated Fathers Name. And are we so degenerate from our Race, Such Sons begotten to our Sires Disgrace. That Thoughts like these shan't force us yet to arm, And Liberty thus want the Power to warm. Let the Pale Coward own a pannick Fear, Or unknown Wars and distant Triumphs hear. Let this heart startle at the Trumpets Voice, And shrink unequal to the Battels Noise. Can Souls like these alas! assist us now, Or rise to Dangers which they never knew; But we whose Courage bids us pant for Fame, And be distinguish'd by the Patriots Name. How should our Breast with sacred Fury glow, And rush undaunted on the guilty Foe: The lawless Rage of Tyrants to restrain, Nor let fair Liberty thus court in Vain. He said. A Generous Ardor stood confes'd, And a fierce Patriot twin'd in ev'ry Breast. Revenge alone employs each Wariours Care, Bends ev'ry Bow, and sharpens ev'ry Spear. Some scour the flying Horse along the Plain, And bids his haughty Neck obey the Rein. With goring Rowels urge him in his Speed, And stop in full Career the bounding Steed. Wallace beheld th'auspicious Fury rise, And Rage redoubled flushing in their Eyes. With Joy he hears this Omen of success And saw just Heaven, decree his Happiness. Nor do the English with less studious Care, Observe the growing Progress of the War, And for the feirce Encounter all prepare. Keen Hesilrig, Arms all their glittring Bands, A Thousand Swords shine in a thousand Hands. A Savage Fury brandishes each Dart, And reeking Slaughter steels each impious Heart But oh! ye Gods shall yon weak Bands prevail, When hot with Rage more numerous Troops assail. May righteous Heaven still blast the lawless Might, And the just Patriots vanquish in the Fight: But now advancing near, they other meet And with no friendly Salutation greet. Stern Vengeance lowring Frowns on every Brow, And hate Arms ev'ry Visage like a Foe. Behold what diff'rent Passions now excite, And join two Nations in the Toils of Fight. Here Pride Ambition Arms each guilty Foe, And Tyranny attends on ev'ry Blow. Here Partiots stand, and boldly dare restrain, The Tyrants growth and check th'Oppressors Reign And the fair Cause of Freeedom to maintain. Now all the Plains with Arms are cover'd o're, And the bent Bow unloads its feathered Store. From well stor'd Quivers but declining Light And ruddy Vesper led the Starry Night: Wallace withdrew where Cartlane Rocks on high Erect their shaggy Tops and threat the Sky, Safe shelter'd there the Scotish Heroes stay And wait impatient for the rising Day, Mean while Fidelia with sad Cares opprest, Had sunk into the silken Arms of Rest; A Thousand Spectres dance before her Sight And add to the pale Terrors of the Night; Sword, Shield and Helms, in mix'd Confusion rise And blended Horrors stare before her Eyes, Even in that Time when all shou'd be at rest When not one Thought shou'd discompose her Breast, Even then she shakes at Hesilrig's fierce Hate, And her Soul shrinks as Prescious of her Fate. Now fierce with Rage the cruel Foe draws near, Oh does not Heaven make Innocence its Care! Where fled thy guardian Angel in that Hour And left his Charge to the fell Tyrant's Power, Shall his fierce Steel be redned with thy Gore And streaming Blood distain thy Beauties o'er? But now awakned with the dreadfull Sound The trembling Matron threw her Eyes around, In vain alace were all the Tears she shed When fierce he waves the Fauchion o'er her Head All Tyes of Honour by the Rogue abjur'd Relentless deep he plung'd the ruthless Sword; Swift o'er her Limbs does creeping Coldness rise And Death's pale Hand seal'd up her fainting Eyes. Now born upon the mournfull Wings of Fame, To Wallace the unhappy Tydings came, The rising Woe sore thrill'd in ev'ry Part, And sought its painfull Passage to the Heart; Graham and his mourning Friends with Tears o'erflow And join Society of great Grief and Woe. When Wallace them beheld he hush'd in Peace And kindly bade their growing Sorrows cease, This waste of Tears alas he cry'd is vain, Nor can recal the fleeting Shade again, Cou'd that vain Thought afford the least Relief, How wou'd I mourn; but impotent is Grief; Then let those Tears, to Wars rough Toil give Way, And the fierce Sword perform what Words wou'd say, Hear me brave Graham, Companion of my Arms, Whose Soul alike is fir'd with Glory's Charms. To thee I Swear this Sword I'll never Sheath Till I Revenge my dearest dearest's Death, Heaven's! what new Toils of Death and War remain? Rivers of floating Blood and Hills of slain But, steel'd with Rage to Slaughter let us fly, And for her Sake there shall Ten Thousand Dye When Men thus Weep their Courage grows the Less, It slaikes the Ire of Wrong they should Redress, But let us hast while yet the dusky Night Extends her friendly Shade, and drowns the infant Light. He said, The Melancholy Troops around, With pleasing Anguish catch the mournfull Sound. A fierce of Revenge bends ev'ry Warrior's Bow, And steely Vengeance sends him to the Foe: For now the armed Warrior's carefull Tread, And march undaunted thro' the murky Shade: No Light in the high Firmament was seen, And like their Vengeance lowring was the Scene; To Lanerk swift, they shape the destin'd Way; The Town defenceless all before them lay. Opprest with Sleep the weary English lay, Nor knew sad Wretches! that their Death drew nigh. Now in Two Bands they part their hostile Force, And to these sleeping Tyrants bend their Force; Where Hesilrig the cruel Murd'rer lay, Eager on Slaughter Wallace wings his Way, A Thousand Ills the Traitor's Mind infest, And warring Furies Combat in his Breast; There Slaughter Rage, rapine together roll, And Guilt sits heavy on his dreadfull Soul. Full on the Gate a Stone the Heroe threw. Swift to the Stroke the rocky Fragment flew. Bars, Bolts, and brazen Hinges soon were broke, And tumbl'd down before the sweepy Stroke. Surpriz'd he stood and listning to the Noise, With beating Heart he heard the Warrior's Voice, Anon beheld the distant beaming Lance, And trembling saw th'injured Man advance; And thought'st thou Traitor fierce the Heroe cry'd, When by thy murd'ring Steel she cruel dy'd; When thy fell Hand her precious Blood did spill, Wallace tho' absent woud be absent still. Furious he spoke and raising on the Foe, Full on his Head discharg'd the pondrous Blow: Down sinks the Head long Fellon to the Ground, The guilty Soul flew trembling thro' the Wound. Mean while enrag'd Graham from his flamy Hand, Full on the Roof directs the hostile Brand. Inclos'd within Thorn saw with dire Amaze The spreading Ruin and the rolling Blaze. Consum'd in Flames he yeilds his latest Breath, And sinks into the fiery Arms of Death. But now the Morning rais'd her beamy Head, Around them lay vast Heaps of slaughter'd Dead, Freed Albion's Ensigns glitter in the Wind, And a new Hope exults in ev'ry Mind. The Soldier views with Joy the sanguine Plain, And Scotia well redeemed with Heaps of slain. The willing Nation own him for their Lord, And joyful croud to his auspicious Sword. With Grief fierce Edward heard his mighty Name, And burns invidious at his growing Fame. He bids his haughty Soldiers come from far, Blacken the Field, and calls forth all his War. None can the Dictates of his Soul controul While his high Conquests urge his rapid Soul. Swift to fair Scotia's Plains he bends his Way, By Fate reserv'd for Biggar's glorious Day. CHAP. II. The Battle of BIGGAR. Now Biggar's Plains with armed Men are crown'd. And shining Lances glitter all around, The sounding Horn, and Clarions all conspire, To raise the Souldiers Breast and kindle up his Fire. The Hero tir'd of Lanerk's luckless Land, Swift now to Biggar leads his conq'ring Band; Each heaving Breast with Thirst of Vengeance glows, And in their tow'ring Hopes already slay their Foes. The careful Wariour on a rising Ground, Encamp'd and saw the dreadful Foes around, Stretch'd out in wide Array along the Plain, And his Heart biggens with the glorious Scene. But now the Morning in fair Beams array'd Rose on the Dark and chas'd the nightly Shade, Each eager Souldier seiz'd his ready Shield, Draws the fierce Blade, and strides along the Field; In blackning Wings extend from Left to Right. Condense in War, and gather to the Fight; Thick beats each Heart waiting the last Command, And Death stands lingring in the lifted Hand. Wallace then threw around his skilful Eyes, And saw with Joy their eager Passions rise, To day my Friends, to day lets boldly dare Each doubtfull Hazard of th'uncertain War; Let our fierce Swords be deeply drench'd in Gore, And then our Toils and Labour shall be o'er: See round our Heads the Guardian Angels stand And Guide the Javelin in each eager Hand; To Edward shall they bear the flying Dart And with the pointed Javelin pierce his Heart, Let Glorious Liberty your Soul inspire Raise ev'ry Heart and rouze the Warriours Fire, He said,— And kindling into Fury rose each Breast, With Love of Virtue all at once possest. Eager they thicken on the Mountains Brow, And hang impendent on the Plain below. The Foe surpriz'd look up and see from far The Progress of the swift descending War. They run, they fly, in Ranks together close, And in a steely Circle meet their coming Foes; But now the Scotish Heroes bend their Way Where in his Tent the Royal Monarch lay, There rose the Battle, there the Warriors tend, And Thousand Deaths on Thousand Wings ascend: Swords, Shields and Spears, in mix'd Confusion glow The Field is swept and lessens at each Blow; Wallace's Helm distinguish'd from afar Tempests the Field and floats amid the War, Imperious Death attends upon his Sword, And certain Conquest waits her destin'd Lord: Fierce in another Quarter, Kent employs The wrathfull Spear nor fewer Foes destroys, Where e'er he conq'ring turns recedes the Foe, And thickned Troops fly open to his Blow. His bounding Courser thundering o'er the Plain, Bears his fierce rapid Lord o'er Hills of slain; Scarce can the Weak retreating Scots withstand, The mighty Sweep of the Invader's Hand. Wallace beheld his fainting Squadron yield, And various Slaughter spread along the Field, Furious he hasts, and heaves his orbed Shield: Resolv'd in Arms to meet his Enemy, Before his Spear they Rush, they run, they fly. And now in equal Battle meet the Foes; Long lasts the Combat and resound their Blows: Their dreadfull Fauchions brandishing on high, In wavy Circles highten to the Sky. With furious Ire they run the Field around, And keen on Death explore each secret Wound. They heave, they pant, they beat in ev'ry Vein While Death fits Idle on the crimson Plain. Long in Suspense th'uncertain Battle hung, And Fortune fickle Goddess doubted long, On whom she should the Laurel Wreath bestow. Whom raise as Conq'ror, whom depress as Foe; At last the Heroe tyr'd with forc'd Delay, At his full Stretch rose and with mighty Sway, Bore from the Foe his Shield's defence away. Now high in Air the shiny Sword he rear'd Pondrous with Fate the shiny Sword appear'd Descending full it stop't his stiffled Breath Giddy he turns around, and reels in Death. The Stringy Nerves are wrapt around in Gore And rushing Blood distain'd his Armour o'er Now all is Death and Wounds, the crimson Plain Floats round in Blood and groans beneath its slain. Promiscuous Crouds one common Ruin share And Death alone employs the wastful War. They trembling fly, by conquering Scots opprest And the broad Ranks of Battle lye defac'd A false Usurper sinks in every Foe, And Liberty returns with ev'ry Blow; Before their Prince the mangled Subjects Dye The Slaughter swells, and groans ascend the Sky: The King beheld with sad astonish'd Eyes The havock of the various Battle rise; Unable to sustain fain wou'd he stay, And yet again retrieve the vanquish'd Day, At last behind his Back he threw the Shield, Spurs on his rapid Steed, forsakes the Field. The Scots pursue and follow fast behind, The rattling Noise swells dreadful in the Wind. With Grief Long-Castle saw the soul Retreat, Restrain their Flight, and durst prolong their Fate Whence does our Hearts this coward Terror know Defeat neer stain'd our conquering Arms till now: Stay Recreant, stay nor thus Ignoble fly But bravely conquer or yet bravely Dye. Scarce had he spoke when quivering all with Fear, Scap'd from the Foe Two Fugi-Friends appear; Stop, stop they cry'd your hasty Flight restrain, And with swift Vengeance meet your Foes again: Opprest with Wine the Scotish Heroes ly, And feel the soft Effect of Luxury: With Ease we may return again, and spread. The crimson Plain around with heaps of Dead. Long-Castle took the Word and led them on Resolv'd to fight with ardent Hast they run. The Scotish Watch-Men from afar descry'd The rallying Foe, and swift to Wallace cry'd, He seiz'd his Horn and gave the signal Sound, The summon'd Soldiers gather fast around; A fiercer Fury kindles in their Eyes And once again their madding Passions rise; So Triton when at Neptun's high Command He heaves the swelly Surge above the Land, When with full Breath he bids the Tempest roar, And dash its sounding Billows to the Shoar, His Angry Waves the wrinkled Seas deform, They raise, they roar, and blacken to a Storm. A Marish now does either Host divide, Eager they view and frown from either Side, But the fierce Duke unable to restrain This rising Passion gave it the full Rein, And first encouraging his Troops around He spurs his thundring Steed and dares the faithless Ground. All plunge at once; resound th'assaulted Skys And Thousands sink, doom'd ne'er again to rise: The thundring Coursers roar and Neigh aloud And then with foamy rage o'erlay the Crowd, While those who Strugling with the miry Tide And with strong Sinews gain the further Side, Tho' landed, only meet a Change of Death, By the fierce Scots depriv'd of fleeting Breath, But now Long-castle gained the dryer Land, And plunging, stood upon the shoaly Strand; Graham soon perceived and hast'ning rais'd a Blow And with his Sword received the rising Foe, Back sinks the foundring Courser down again, O'erlays his Lord he tumbles midst the slain, Thus Edward the important Day has lost, And to his Kingdom leads his remnant Host: While the glad Nation smiles in Liberty, And send their humble Thanks to Heaven with Joy. Now where the Cree rolls down its rapid Tide, And sees the Herds adorn his wealthy Side, A towring Rock uprears its bending Brow And throws its frowning Terror down below, Deep in the Earth is fix'd its ample Bed And murky Night involves its airy Head, There Alder and tough Oaks conspire with Art To raise on high the Rock, a steepy Fort. Where a great Gate its Brazen Arms oppos'd And from the Victors rage defends th'inclos'd Safe in their Planky Tower they shelter'd lye, And from the Oaky Wall the Scotish Power defy; Wallace beheld and eager to obtain The airy Fort, he swell'd in every Vein. And when the Night o'erspread the silent Ground And on black Wings dark Vapours swim around, Eager he bids the weary Soldiers rise, And with slow Heavings Labour up the Skys. Himself and Kierly led the airy Fight Strain up the Steep and toil with all their Might, The Centinel lay sleeping at the Gate Doom'd ne'er to wake unconscious of his Fate, Deep in his Breast was plung'd a shining Sword The ruthless Steel his bleeding Bosom gor'd; Then entring in they slay each Foe they meet, The trembling Wretches groan'd beneath their Feet; They all give Way, and thundring down the Steep, Shoot in the Waves, Resounds the parted Deep. But O how quickly alter'd is the Case! The English now, most humbly sue for Peace. Worn with Defeats, their stubborn Passions yeild, Nor dare appear within the bloody Field. Their hoary Senators whose early Care, Wou'd stay the fatal Progress of the War, In suppliant Words the Scotish Hero greet, And lay their Lawrels low beneath his Feet. At Ruglen Church it was where they did meet, The Hero to the Terms of Peace agreed, And with an Oath the Truth is ratify'd: That either Nation shall from Battle cease, And Death should hang his weary Wings in Peace. But soon these Vows shall all dissolve in Air, And the returning Year bring back the War; The thundring Battle spread along the Plain. And the brave Heroe Shine in Arms again The End of the Sixth Book. The Seventh BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. How WALLACE burn't the Barns of Air, put Bishop Beik out of Glasgow, and killed Lord Peircy. With Wallace now concluded is the Truce, But mark what Treachery it does produce: To English Faith, the great Seal they append In Februar; yet March doth scarcely end, When they of new contrive a hellish Plot, Do break their Faith, and murder many a Scot. The English King takes Journey in April, And holds a mighty Council in Carlisle. To which the English Captains hastned fast, And privy were to every Thing that past. None other to be present thought he good, But such as were of true born English Blood. Except Sir Aymer Vallance, as I'm told, Who to the Scots a Traitor was of old. The Southeron here Consult him, how and where, They might cut off the Barrons bold of Air. Who, when he had in Pluto's Myst'rie div'd, Gave such Advice as Hell and he contriv'd. Four Barns he said built by the King's Command, At the Head Burgh of that old County stand. Where, at one Time, none but a single Man May enter in, or see another can That is said he, Pox on his Bloody Face I think the only, and the proper Place, To call the Barrons to a Justice aire And then dispatch them at your Pleasure there. To which they all, with Spite and Malice fill'd, Consent, and vote them basely to be kill'd. Except Lord Piercy, who, the curs'd Design, And Villany, pretended to decline. The Scots said he, have keeped Faith so long With me, I'll not be Witness to such Wrong. But at the Time apointed will withdraw, To Glasgow Town, from such a Bloody Law. Fy on the Piercy that was so unkind, Not to reveal the barbarous Design. Where were thy Bowels of Compassion then? That might have sav'd four or five Thousand Men Of Scots and English, that no Harm did fear, As by the tragic Story shall appear. A cruel Justice then, they choos'd and fierce, Whose bloody Acts a Heart of Stone would pierce: Lord Arnulf, whom, Beelzebub scarce could match, He undertook the Barons to dispatch. Another Aire in Glasgow order'd they, For Clydsdale Men upon the self same Day. Thus they like Devils sit in humane Shape, And charge that Wallace by no Means escape. For well they knew, if he were overthrown, They might possess all Scotland as their own. Thus they conclude, to other give the Hand, And set their Seals to this black hellish Band To Air the Justice speedily comes down, And Piercy marches off for Glasgow Town. The Justice aire on June the Eighteen Day Was set, proclaim'd, no Barron was away. The Scots they wondr'd, in a peaceful Land Why English-men should rule with such high Hand. Sir Rannald did appoint before this aire, At Monkton-Kirk his Friends to meet him there. Wallace was present 'mongst those Gentlemen, He Warden was of Scotland chosen then. Good Mr. John, who sirnamed was Blair, Discharg'd his Friends from going to that Aire, And did suspect since Piercy left that Land, He was no Friend to Scots, did then Command, Wallace from them went to the Church with speed, There said a PATER-NOSTER, and a CREED. He lean'd him down upon a Place hard by, Then in a deep Sleep fell immediately: Into that Slumber Wallace thought he saw, A Stalwart Man that towards him did draw. Who hastily did catch him by the Hand, I am he said sent to thee by Command. A Sword he gave him of the finest Steel, This Sword said he, Son, may thou manage well. A Topas fine the Plummet he did guess, The Hilt and all, did glitter o'er like Glass. Dear Son he said, we tarry here too long, Shortly thou must revenge thy Countrie's Wrongs, Then led he him unto a Mountain high, Where he at once might all the World see. There left he Wallace, contrair his Desire, To whom appear'd, a very dreadfull Fire. Which fiercely burnt, and wasted thro' the Land, Scotland all o'er, from Ross to Sulway Sand. Quickly to him descended there a Queen, All shining Bright, and with majestick Mein, Her Countenance did dazle so his Sight, It quite extinguish't all the Fire Light. Of Red, and Green, gave him with modest Grace A Wand, and with a Sapphire cross'd his Face. Welcome she said, I choose thee for my Love, Thou granted art by the great God above, To help and aid poor People that get Wrong, But with thee now I must not tarry long; To thine own Host thou shalt return again, Thy dearest Kin in Torment are and Pain. This Kingdom thou redeem it surely shall, Tho' thy Reward on Earth shall be but small. Go on and prosper, sure thou shalt not miss, For thy Reward the Heavens eternal Bless. With her right Hand she reached him a Book, Then hastily her Leave of him she took. Unto the Clouds ascended out of sight, Wallace the Book embrac'd with all his Might. The Book was writ in three Parts and no less, The first big Letters were, and all of Brass: The second Gold, Silver the third most fine, At which he greatly wondred in his Mind: To read the Book he made great haste, but as He did awake, behold a Dream it was. Quickly he rose, and there a Man he found, Who did his Dream, and Vision all expound. The stalwart Man, who gave thee that fine Sword Was Fergus King of Scots, upon my Word. The Mountain does prognosticate no less, Than Knowledge how our Wrongs thou must redress. The Fire hasty Tidings doth presage, The like of which was not heard in our Age. The bright and shining Queen, whom thou didst see, Was Fortune, which portends great Good to thee. The pretty Wand which she unto thee sent, Betokens Pow'r, Command, and Chastisement. The colour Red, if I right understand, Means bloody Battles shortly in our Land: The Green, great Courage to thee does portend, And Trouble great, before the Wars shall end. The Saphire Stone she blessed thee withall, Is happy Chance, pray God it thee befall The threefold Book, is this poor broken Land Thou must redeem, by thy most valiant Hand. The great big Letters which thou saw of Brass, Prognostick Wars that shall this Land oppress. Yet every Thing to its true Right again Thou shalt restore; But thou must suffer Pain. The Gold betokens Honour, Worthiness, Victorious Arms, Manhood, and Nobleness. The Silver shows clean Life, and Heavenly bless, Which thou for thy Reward shalt never miss. Then do not fear, or in the least despair, He shall protect thee who of all takes care. He thank'd him, then, committing all to God, Home unto Corsby with his Uncle rode. Both blyth and glad, all Night they lodged there, And on the Morn, made ready all for Air. Wallace he ask'd Sir Rannald at Kincase, Where was the English Charter of the Peace, At Corsby said Sir Rannald, in the Chest, Go seek it there thou'll find it if thou list. None but thy self where it does lye doth know, Then by good Luck he back again did go. Sir Rannald he rode on and rested not, Then came to Air knew nothing of the Plot. Into the Town he did not tarry long, Went to the bloody Barns dreading no Wrong. A Baulk was knit with cruel Ropes and keen, O! such a slaughter House was never seen. Strong Men to keep the Entry they prepare, And none but One at once, must enter there. Sir Rannald first, that ancient Knight comes in, And then the bloody Murther does begin. A running Cord they slipped o'er his Head, Then to the Baulk they haled him up dead. Sir Bryce the Blair after Sir Rannald past, The cruel Dogs to Death him hastned fast. No sooner enters, but he's in the Snare, And on the bloody Baulk was hanged there. A gallant Knight Sir Neil Montgomrie, Was hanged next which Pity was to see. Great Numbers more of landed Men about Went in, but none alive at all came out. The Wallaces, and Crawfords stout like Steel, Great Cruelty from barb'rous Sutheron feel. The Kennedie's of Carrick slew they alse, And the kind Campbels that were never False, Nor did rebel against the righteous Crown, For which the Sutheron hang'd and hew'd them down. The Barclays, Boyds, and Stuarts of good Kin, No Scot escap'd that Time that enter'd in. Unto the Baulk they hang'd up many a Pair, Then in some ugly By-nook cast them there. Since the first Time that Men did War invent, To so unjust a Death none ever went. Thus to the Gods of their most cruel Wrath, They sacrific'd the Scots and broke their Faith. Such Wickedness each Christian Soul must own, Was ne'er before in all the World known. Thus eighteen Score to Death they put outright Of Barrons bold; with many a gallant Knight. Then last of all with great Contempt and Scorn, Cast out the Corps naked as they were born. Good Robert Boyd with Twenty valiant Men, Of Wallace House went to the Tavern then. Brave Stout and Bold the Choice of all the Land, He them in Wallace Absence did Command. Kierly who did the Sutheron often Mall, Cleland and Boyd were all upon a Call: And Ste'en of Ireland, who upon the Street, With a good Woman and a true did meet. He ask'd at her what News there was in Air, Nothing said, she but Sorrow, Dole and Care. All frighted like, she look'd him in the Face, Then ask'd for Wallace in a little Space: Who told, his Uncle the good ancient Knight Had sent him Home, but would be back on sight. Pray charge his Men, said she, to leave the Place, I'll Wallace watch as he comes from Kincase And him acquaint with ev'ry Thing that's past, The sad Barbarities from First to Last. Now quietly together call your Force, Get all to Arms, and quickly mount your Horse. He with the Woman did no longer stay, But to his Comrades posted fast away: Told the sad News; who without speaking more, March all to Laglane Wood, with Hearts full sore. Now with the Charter Wallace hasts to Air, But little knew the Massacre was there. Then loudly on him the good Woman calls, Nothing but Breach of Faith within those Walls. Our Barrons bold thro' horrid Treacherie Are kill'd and hang'd, like Beasts up to a Tree, Most basely murdered as they went in, Then Wallace wept, for Loss of his good Kin. Unto the Woman up he Gallops fast, To understand the Truth of all was past. Is my dear Uncle Dead, or how befel The Case; good Woman pray make hast and tell. Out of yon Barns, with great Contempt and Scorn, I saw him cast; naked as he was Born. His cold pale Lips with grieved Heart and sore I kiss'd; then spread a Cloath his Body o'er. His Sister's Son thou worthy art and Wight. Revenge his Death I pray with all thy Might. I shall Assist as I'm a Woman True, Then he enquired at her, if she knew, Good Robert Boyd, and if she saw him there; Or William Crawford, if he living were: Or Adam Wallace, a good Friend indeed, Both true, and trusty, in the Time of Need. Call them to me, with little Noise and Dinn, Then cunningly spy out the Justice Inn. See what Discov'ries thou of them can make, And then I'll see the next best Course to take. This in great Haste, he spake and said no more, Then wheel'd about, with grieved Heart and sore. To Laglane Woods, then pleasant, sweet and green, Which oft his Refuge had, and Safety been; There for his Friends did mourn, with Grief and Woe, Till his proud Breast was like to burst in two. Lord Arnulph quickly after him does send, Fifteen Hand-waild, well mounted English-men. A Macer als, to bring him back to Law, Who furiously towards good Wallace draw; With Sword in Hand among them soon he went, And pay'd them soundly to their Heart's Content. One thro' the middle there he cut in two, Unto the Second gave a deadly Blow: The Third he struck, down thro' the Body clave, The Fourth unto the Ground he quickly drave. The Fifth he smote in such great Wrath and Ire, He on the Spot did presently Expire. Three Men he had that killed other Five, With much adoe the rest escap'd alive: Fled to their Lord, told all the Passage o'er How Ten of Fifteen Men, were kill'd by Four. And had it not been for their Horse, that they The other Five had gone the self same Way. A right Scots Stroke none of us sooner got, Than without Mercy we lay on the Spot. So fierce they fought it, and so furiously, At every Stroke they made a Man to dye. Then thought they all, it must be Wallace wight, To whom reply'd an ancient English Knight, And said, if Wallace hath escap'd this Aire, All that is done, is adding Grief to Care. Then spoke the Justice, when this Rumour rose. What would ye do, if there were many Foes? That for one Man so frighted seem to be, And are not sure as yet if it be he. And tho' it were, I count the Matter light, Each Gentleman who stays here shall be Knight. And so soon as the Morrow comes, I'll then, Deal the Scots Lands to true born English-Men. Thus spoke that Cruel, indefiderate Beast, But was mistaken, Faith for all his Haste: Which minds me of a Saying, Sage, and wise. Who compt's before the Rost he compteth twice. The Suthron to their Quarters now repair, Four thousand Strong that Night did lodge in Air. And in the bloody Barns, without the Town, Where the proud Justice caus'd proclaim around The Walls and Garrison, on every Side, That no Scots Man within them should abide. By Providence that Night it hap'ned so, The Justice to the Castle would not go: Lodg'd in the Barns, knew not of Wallace Plot, Who long ere Morn gave him a Wak'ning hot. At Supper they eat a prodigious Deal, Then plenty drank of Wine and English Ale. No Watch they set, having no Fear or Doubt, Of Harm from Scots, who lodged all without. The great Fatigue and Toil, that Bloody Day The Rogues had got, and too much Wine which they Drank off in Bumpers, lull'd them so asleep, They quite forgot that Night a Guard to keep. Thus all secure, they snorting lay like Swine, Their Chiftain was great Bacchus God of Wine. So soon's the Woman saw them lying so, Some Men she warned, and made to Laglane go. Foremost she went her Faithfulness was such At which good Wallace was comforted much. He thanked God when as he saw them there, What News good Woman hast thou brought from Air. Yon bloody Hounds said she, are all so drunk, With Wine, they'r now all in a deep sleep sunk. When I them left could not so much as see, One single Scots-Man in their Company. If that be true, it's Time to steer my Stumps, And set a Fire to their English Rumps. To him resort Three hundred chosen Men, Willing and ready their best Blood to spend. Out of the Town there came good Ale and Bread, And each Thing else whereof they stood in need: They ate and drank, and welcome were for nought, The Gentrie then Jop unto Wallace brought. Alace said Wallace my dear Friends you see; Our Kin are slain and murd'red barb'rously. Therefore I pray for our poor Countrie's Sake, Let's now advise what Course is best to take. Your Warden tho' I chosen was to be, Yet in the Place since I so many see, Of as good Blood, and ancient Scots Descent, And ev'ry way on Honour as much bent, Forward and brave, in all good likelyhood, As ever I; then let us here conclude, To choose us Five of this good Company, And then cast Lots who shall our Captain be. Wallace, and Boyd, and Crawford of Renown, And Adam then the Lord of Richartoun, And Auchinleck, in War a skilful Man, To cast the Lots about these five began. On Wallace still unto their great Surprise, The Lot did fall, tho' it was casten thrice. Then Wallace rose, and out his Sword he drew, And solemnly did to his Saviour vow, And to the Virgin Mary that e'er long, He should aveng'd be on the Southeron. I do protest he said, to all that's here, For my brave Uncle's Death they shall pay dear. And many more of our good worthy Kin, Who's Blood they shed and did not mind the Sin. For which I'll play them such an after Game, Shall make them all pass thro' the fiery Flame; Before I either Eat, or Drink, or Sleep, This solemn Vow most sacredly I'll keep. Then all most humbly, and with one Accord, Receiv'd him as their Chiftain and their Lord. Fine Chalk the Woman quickly does procure, Wherewith she chalked ev'ry English Door: And all the Gates which led unto the Streets, Where Sutheron sleep'd securely in their Sheets. Then twenty Men he caused Widdies thraw, No sooner spoke, than's Word it was a Law, With which the Doors they instantly make fast, To Hasp and Staple with a sicker Cast. Boyd to the Castle past, the safest Way, With fifty Men, and there in Ambush lay, That in Revenge of his poor slaughter'd Kin, None might escape of all that were within. The rest with Wallace, all the Barns surround, And noble Service from the Woman found. Who Flax, and Fire, brought unto their Mind And all Combustibles that she could find. Wallace commanded all his Men about, On pain of Death no Suthron should break out. Nor rescu'd be, tho' he were of their Kin, From the red Fire, or they should burn therein. The Conflagration shin'd so clear and bright, Is not said Wallace this a pleasant Sight, Our former Wrongs this will in part redress, When these are gone, their Pow'r will be the less, Then Wallace call'd with Majesty and Aw, Brave Justice Sir, come execute your Law. 'Gainst us that Live, and are escap'd your Aire, Deal not our Lands, for Faith that were not fair. Thy cruel Bloodshed now confess and mourn, And take thy Choise whither thou'll Hang or Burn. With that the fiery Flames ascend aloft, To sleeping Folk such wakening was not soft. The Sight without was terrible to see Then guess what cruel Pain within might be. Which to the Bloody Monsters there befell, Next to the Torments I may say of Hell. The Buildings great were all burnt down that Night None there escaped, Squire, Lord or Knight. When great huge Roof Trees fell down them among O such a sad and Melancholy Song; Some naked burnt to Ashes all away Some never rose, but smoth'red where they lay. Others attempting to get to the Air: With Fire and Smoke were burnt and choaked there Their nauseous Smell none present could abide, A just Reward; for Murder will not hide. With Sorrow thus and many a grievous Groan, They languish'd till their sinfull Days were gone. Some sought the Door endeav'ring out to get, But Scotsmen them so wisely did beset, Out of the burning Flames whoever got, Immediatly was cut down on the Spot. Or driven back, with Fury in the Fire, Such Wages got these Hangmen for their Hire, A Friar Drumlaw, who Prior was of Air, Sevenscore that Night upon him lodged were Of Suthron Louns, for he an Inn did keep, But watch'd them well till they fell all asleep. The Smoak and Flame no sooner there arose, Then he contriv'd Revenge upon his Foes. Unto his Brethren Seven the Secret told All stately Fellows sturdy brisk and bold Who soon the English Armour do command: And a choice Sword each one takes in his Hand. In Harness thus, they doe themselves infold And then the Frier leads on the Brothers bold. These Eight brave Friers, to sundry Places goe With Sword in Hand to ev'ry House went Two Wherein the bloody drunken Sutheron were, And them dispatch'd, as they lay sleeping there. Some did awake into that doleful Case, Who naked fled, and got out of the Place. Some Water sought, confus'dly thro' their Sleep, Then drown'd in the Frier's Well both large and deep. Thus slain and drown'd were all that lodged there, Men call it since the Frier's Blessing of Air. Few in the Castle that were Men of Note, Remain'd alive but burnt were on the Spot. Some, when the furious fiery Flames were out, In haste came forth, not having the least Doubt, Of Harm from Scots, either by Lass or Lad, But far less from good Boyd his Ambuscade, Who like a Soger prudent, wise, and douss, Let them alone, then straight march'd to the House; And won the Port, enter'd with all his Men, Where only left were Keepers Nine or Ten The foremost soon he seized in his Hand, Made quite of him, then slew the rest he fand. Arnulf, who did refuse his Lodging there, Was burnt to Ashes in the Barns of Air. Provisions in the Castle there was none, Not long before, from it was Piercy gone. Boyd, there made Twenty of his Men to stand, Then went and waited Wallace's Command. Who kept the Town, till nothing left was there, But raging Fire, and brave Buildings bare. Of Englishmen in Spite of all their Might, By Sword and Fire, Five Thousand dy'd that Night When Wallace Men together all were met Good Friends he said, you know an Air was set; That Clidsdale Men to Glasgow should repair To Bishop Beik and the Lord Piercy there. We'll thither haste therefore, tho' we be few, Of our good Kin some killed are e'er now. The Burgessess he caus'd unto him call, And gave Command in gen'ral to them all; Safely to watch, and guard the House of Air, With outmost Caution, Diligence, and Care. To which they all consented and did say, With chearful Heart they'd his Command obey. Wallace, his Men, refresh't themselves and so, For Glasgow Town prepar'd in Haste to go. Choice of good English Horses to their Mind, They took along, and left the Bad behind. In Haste away rides that brave Cavalry, Three hundred Strong was the good Company; To Glasgow Town march these good Men and true, And pass the Bridge before the Suthron knew. Lord Piercy soon with Diligence and Care, His Men conveen'd all in good Order there. Who do conclude, that it must Wallace be, Prepare for Fight, either to doe or Die, The Bishop Beik and Piercy upon Sight. Led on a Thousand Men in Armour bright. Wallace he views their Force, then back does ride And in two Squadrons did his Horse divide. Harnish'd his Men who were in Number few, Then call'd on Auchinleck both stout and true. Uncle he said, e'er we these Men assaill, Whither will ye bear up the Bishop's Tail, Or with the foremost will ye Gallop on, Kneel down, and take that Prelat's Bennison. Quoth Auchinleck, I'll not ambitious be, Your self may take his Blessing first for me. That is the Post of Honour, and your Right, I shall bear up his Tail with all my Might. Since we must part, you'll be much in the Wrong Good Wallace said, if you stay from us long. Your Men will not regard their Number vast, For God's Sake then march on your Squadron fast Our Parting I would not the Suthron saw, March you behind in thro' the North-East Raw; Good Men of War are in Northumberland, Thus parted, and took other by the Hand. Quoth Auchinleck, we'll do the best we may, 'Twill not be right if we stay long away. Ther's be a Reel among us speedily, But to the Right Almighty God have Eye. Then Adam Wallace, and good Auchinleck, With sevenscore Men of Note and good Respect, Brave cliver Boys, stout, able, haill and sound, March briskly up the back side of the Toun: Till they were fairly out of Suth'ron sight, The other Squadron dress with all their Might. Wallace and Boyd up thro' the plain Street go, The English wond'red when they saw no moe. An Ensign was with Beik and Piercy there, Who boldly call'd, and challeng'd what they were A fierce Encounter then, and sharp between The Scots, and English, as was ever seen Quickly ensues, with such a dreadful Dint, Till from their Swords the Fire flew like Flint. The hardy Scots most manfully they fought, And to the Ground Heaps of the Suthron brought. Pierced their Plates with pointed Swords of Steel, At ev'ry Blow they made them there to kneel. The Stour like Smoak arose among them fast, Darkned the Sun and to the Clouds it past. Honour to gain each Scotsman did his best, Tho' with great Numbers they were sadly prest. Yet gallantly they fought and pushed on With Sword in Hand, and charg'd the Sutheron. Lord Piercy's Men expert in War I wot, Most fiercely sought, and flinched ne'er a Foot. Then Adam Wallace, and good Auchinleck, Their Duty next in truth do not neglect. But like brave Sogers, do obey Command; And boldly enter all with Sword in Hand. Amidst the Contest hot, and fierce Dispute, At which some Suthron bravely fac'd about. Who stoutly charg'd the Scots, and very fast, But were oblidg'd to yeild their Ground at last. This fresh Releif so eager fought and keen, And made such slaps as never yet was seen. 'Mongst Englishmen, that to their very Will, The Scots got room to fight and slay their fill. Then Wallace 'mids that cruel Bloody throng, With his good Sword that heavy was and long, At the Lord Piercy such a stroak he drew, Till Bone and Brain in different Places flew Whom, when his Men perceiv'd that he was Dead, With Bishop Beik all marched off with speed. By the Frier Church, out thro' a Wood they throng, But in that Forrest durst not tarry long. Thus in a Hurry all to Bothwel scour, The Scotish Swords were sharp for to endure. So cruel was the Skirmage and so hot, The English left Seven Hundred on the Spot. Wallace he follow'd with stout Men and tight, Altho' for-foughten, marched all that Night; Many he slew into the chase that Day. But yet with Beik Three hundred got away: The Traitor Vallange he escap'd also To all true Scots Men still a mortal Foe. Five thousand Suthron Wallace burnt at Air, At Glasgow Town Seven hundred killed there. The Suthron chas'd to Bothwel that strong Place, Then did return within a little Space. Thus with Fatigue, and want of Sleep opprest, Rode to Dundaff, and there took him some Rest Told good Sir John of all befel in Air, Who did regrate he was not with him there. Wallace he sojourn'd in Dundaff at Will, Five Summer Days with Pleasure there until, He Tidings got from good Men all forlorn, Buchan was up, Athol, Monteith, and Lorn. That on Argyle a furious War they make, All for King Edward's cruel bloody Sake. Campbel the Knight that witty was and smart, Stay'd in Argyll in spite of Edward's Heart. And keeped still his Heritage Lochow, In spite of the M?Fadzean's Sword and Bow. Who 'cause he had unto King Edward Sworn Gave him Argyll, and all the Lands of Lorn. False John of Lorn to that Gift did accord, Because in England he was made a Lord. Duncan of Lorn he stood up for the Land, Who when o'ercame by the M?Fadzean: Did joyn himself to Campbel that brave Knight, In War who was both worthy, wise, and wight. M?Fadzean now with Diligence and Care, His Five new Lordships 'bout him 'sembles there. That Tyrant to the Land no sooner comes, Than he packs up an Army of vile Scums: Full Fifteen thousand cursed Rogues indeed Of omne-gatrhums after him does lead. Many of whom he had from Ireland got, Man, Wife, nor Child, these Monsters spared not. Wasted the Land, where e'er they came at Will, Nothing they knew, but burn, destroy and kill, Into Lochow they enter speedily, Which when the good Knight Campbel did espy In Craighumure three Hundred Men he puts, And holds that Strength, in spite of all their Guts. Then broke the Bridge that o'er they might not pass, But thro' a Foord, that deep and narrow was. Securely there, and safe made his Abode, Aufe, did defend him that was deep and broad. M?Fadzean was on the other Side, And there perforce obliged was to bide. Till 'twixt a Rock and a great Water-side, Where none but Four in Front could either march or ride, M?Fadzean has a little Passage found, Were he o'er that, he thought all was his own. Where plenty he of Cattle for no Cost Might get; for to maintain his savage Host. Duncan of Lorn, unto his Travells got In Quest of Wallace to prevent the Plot. For speedy Succours to the Knight's Relief, Against M?Fadzean, that false Traytor Thief. Gilmichal then, a Foot-man clean and tight, With Duncan went, to guide his Way aright. Thus cliverly away the Couple trudg'd, Till they came straight where the wight Wallace lodg'd. There, they tho' wearie, all fatigu'd and faint, Against M?Fadzean table their Complaint. When Earl Malcolm, he the Tydings knew, To Wallace hasts, with his Men stout and true. Sir John the Graham, there does him also meet, M?Fadzean's Wars so griev'd his noble Sp'rit. Richard of Lundie came the self same Day, Who all with Wallace boldly march away. CHAP. II. How WALLACE slew M?Fadzean. Then Wallace march'd to view M?Fadzean's Host, Of Savages, and Knaves, made up almost. By Stirling Castle held to the South Hand, Which that great Rogue Old Ruickby, did command. To Earl Malcom, Wallace looking back, What would you think this Fortress to attack. And it reduce, by some new Stratagem, All good said he, so said Sir John the Graham. Wallace, his Men then he divided so, That his true Strength the English should not know. The Earl lay in Ambush out of Sight, Wallace with him took good Sir John the Knight. A Hundred brave bold Scots do him attend, Who never turn'd their Backs on English Men. Thro' Stirling Town, straight to the Bridge rode they, In noble Order, and in good array. Whom when old Ruickby narrowlly did view. Caus'd Sevenscore Archers presently pursue. And them engage, but Wallace void of fear. Into his Hand holding a noble Spear. He fiercely towards those proud Archers drew, And on the spot the first that met, him slew, Sir John the Graham, none could him there withstand, Who also had a good Spear in his Hand: The first he met, to present Death was sent, His Spear in Pieces on the Second went. His gallant Sword then drew he out with speed, A noble Friend to him in Time of Need. Fresh English Archers, round about him drew, And with their Arrows his brave Horse they slew. When Wallace saw, that good Sir John was put To such Distress, and that he fought on Foot, He with some others, from their Horse alight, And quickly put the Suthron all to flight. Who to the Castle back thought to repair, But Earl Malcom bauk'd their Fancy there. Betwixt them and the Castle-Gate he got Where he kill'd many English Men of Note. Into the Throng Wallace with Ruickby met, Of the old Rogue there such a Stroke did get; As made his Head upon the Field to dance, But his two Sons by Accident and Chance Into the Castle whence they came before, With Thirty Men escaped and no more. The Lennox Men, both stout and bold also, There from the Castle would not stir nor go, But carefully besieg'd it round about, As knowing well it could not long stand out. The Siege goes on, unto the Earl's Mind, But Wallace he pursues his first Design. To fight M?Fadzean that most bloody Rogue, Who for his Villany did bear the Vogue. Against him Wallace vow'd and swore Revenge, From which his Mind ne'er alter should nor change. That till he had the Honour to put down, That wicked Tyrant he should ne'er sleep sound. At Stirling Bridge, assembled to him then, Two thousand brave, and valiant Scottish Men. Who to Argyll in noble Order ride. Duncan of Lorn, he was their trusty Guide. By this Time Ruickby's Sons did fancy that, It was Time for them to capitulat. And with the Earl Malcom for to treat, Who were both destitute of Men and Meat. That on Condition he their Lives wou'd spare, And Mercy grant to all the rest were there: And give them safe-guard to their native Land, They would resign both Castle and Command. The Articles were sign'd that very Day, Then Bag and Baggage they march all away, Now Wallace he is gone with all his Force, Against the Rogue M?Fadzean, Foot and Horse. Duncan of Lorn, Gilmichael as a Spy Has sent; who knew the Country perfectly. Scarce by Strathfillan was the Army gone, Till Horse and Foot were like to faint each one. Brave Lads said Wallace, it's not Time for us, In broken Ranks to meet the En'my thus. The feebler Sort let them still following be, The Rest shall march into Divisions Three. Five Hundred first, unto himself he told, Of Westland-Men, all sturdy stout and bold. Five Hundred next, Sir John the Graham he got, Lundie Five Hundred more, all Men of Note. 'Mongst whom was Wallace stout of Riccardtoun, Who at a Pinch a sturdy Friend was found. Five Hundred of the Weak, were left behind, Tho' cross unto, and sore against their Mind. Thus Wallace Host began to take the Hight, Then o'er a Mountain marched out of Sight. Into Glendocher, they met with their Spy, And good Lord Campbel who couragiously, Led now Three Hundred valiant chosen Men, A merry Meeting was betwixt them then. Chear up he said, and never dread your Foes, Yon silly Beasts, have neither Arms nor Cloaths Soon shall they fly, and shortly we pursue, Then to Lochdocher speedily they drew. Where Wallace said, one Fate to all shall be, Since here is none, will from his Fellow flee. Upon the Moss an out-spy does appear, To see if Roads, and Passes, all be clear. M?Fadzean for that purpose had him sent, Who shortly after thought his Time ill spent, Gilmichael at the Rogue nimbly did make, With a good Sword, and did him overtake, Thro' fear the Fellow there, beshit his Trews, And ne'er return'd to tell his Master News. The Cavalry are forced now to light, And quite their Horses, tho', both fresh and tight. The Moss and Craigs, them to their shifts did put. Let's see quoth Wallace, who walks best on Foot Out thro' the Moor his Men does bravely lead, Into a Strength, which Service did indeed, Enlong the shoar, Three in the Front they past, Till all the Men March'd safely up at last. Yon Folk Lord Campbel said, I'll paun my Neck, Shall get a metting they doe not Expect. I see no Way they have from us to sly, But Waters deep, and craigy Mountains high. Then Eighteen hundered valiant Scots indeed, Attack M?Fadzean's numerous Host with speed. Upon their Front, great Havock soon did make, The frighted Foes surpris'd, with Terrour shake. Yet Boldly Ralzie, and together rush, Till Wallace does them with such fierceness push: That furiously, with dreadfull stroaks and sore, He drave them back Five Aikers breadth and more; In modest speaking; with good Swords of Steell, He made them Dance, a Sore and Bloody Reell. Whom e'er he hit, no longer there could stand, Made room about him, a large Rude of Land. Sir John the Graham, did show his warlick Art, Lord Campbell als, and Lundie play'd their Part. Stout Adam Wallace, and good Robert Boyd, Where e'er they came, cut down, and all destroy'd The Conflict grew so verie sharp and Hot, And the M?fadzean, fought so on the spot: With Irish Men, that hardy were and stout, The Victory for some Time stood in doubt The Bloody streams, from Front, to Rear did run, And many a Man lay gasping on the Ground. For Two long Hours, they fought it Hand to Fist Untill the very stoutest gladly wish'd, For some respite; their wearied Arms to rest, As yet none knew, which of them had the best. So fiercely fought M?Fadzean's cruel Currs; But Wallace Men, together stuck like Burrs. So Hardy were, so Valiant and so Good, Made great Effusion of the En'my's Blood. With Sword in Hand, they fiercely forward throng, Made fearful Slops their cruel Foes among. Numbers of Irish, sleep'd in a cold Bed, The rest wheel'd to the Left about, and fled. O'er Craigy Rocks, some fell thro' great Despair, And in the Water drown'd Two thousand were. M?Fadzean's Scots-born Men, stay'd on the Field, Threw down their Arms, and on their Knees they kneel'd; On Wallace loudly cry and Mercy crave Who gen'rously them gallant Quarters gave They'r our own Blood he said, both Man and Boy Such Penitents, can any Heart destroy? Then ordered all Scots Men that were found, To save alive but Forreigners cut down. M?Fadzean fled, and is with Fifty gone Under Craigmore, unto a Cave of Stone. Duncan of Lorn, from Wallace asketh Leave, To pay a Visit to this ancient Cave. Which Wallace grants, then quickly does him send With a Detachment of some sturdy Men. Who soon dispatch'd the Fifty, kill'd them dead, And then brought back the Rogue M?Fadzean's Head. Thro' all the Field, they show the Villain's Face Upon a Spear unto his great Disgrace. High on Craigmore, Lord Campbel made it stand Upon a Pole for Honour of Ireland. The best Men there that were of Scotland born To Wallace they Fidelity have sworn. He did protect all came unto his Peace, So pitiful he was and full of Grace. Then after all straight way to Lorn he went, And rul'd the Land unto their great Content. A Councel at Archattan did proclaim, Where many came, so soon's they heard his Name From ev'ry Art; and humbly Thanks they gave, With joyful Hearts, unto their Warden brave. All Lorn he gave to Duncan stout and wight, Who always acted what was just and right. Brook thou this Land, as thy true Heritage, And for thy Brother's Son, that taketh Wage From Edward; If he will return shall have His Lands, I'll lose no Man that I can save. Of worthy Scots, to Wallace not a few, Unto Archattan, from their Strengths withdrew Brave Sir John Ramsay, who with Heart and Hand, Did still stand up for his true native Land: Of noble Blood, and ancient Pedigree, To Wallace there, with Sixty Men came he. Who 'gainst the English did great Danger risk, And was so Stout, Couragious, and Brisk: He from his Faith was never known to flinch, Nor to King Edward, ever yield an Inch. Into Strochane, a long Time there did lye, And fought the Suthron always valiantly. Who, him and his, did grievously oppress, His Son was call'd the flow'r of Courtliness. Who otherways dare say, do him traduce, If they'l but read the History of Bruce. They'l find recorded there his glorious Fame, Brave Alexander was his Christian Name. In Peace, and War, he always ruled well, Such was his Courage, Conduct and his Skill. In Time of War, for Honour did contest, Of the Crown's Friends, was thought one of the best. In Time of Peace, he never had a Peel, So courteous he was, and so Genteel. Ambitiously, each, his Acquaintaince sought, Of Manners he was Quintessence thought. Freely and truly at all Times he spoke, And what he promis'd never ru'd, nor broke. Roxburgh he won, and held it faithfully, Till Traytors thro' their Treason caus'd him dye, But in what cursed Way and Manner how, It is not proper to relate it now, And on that Subject we shall talk no more. His Father came, as I have told before: Who cheerfully, great willingness did show, For to assist against the common Foe. Each Man did him esteem, and highly prise, In War; for Sober, Vigilant and Wise: A Prelate next, unto Ardchattan came, Who of his Lordship, nought had but the Name. He worthy was, both prudent, grave, and Sage, Of sinclair Blood, not Fourty Years of Age. The Pope to save poor sinfull Souls from Hell, Did him creat Lord Bishop of Dunkel. But English men, thro' greed and avarice, Depriv'd him basely of his benefice. Not knowing then to whom to make his sute, To save his Life dwelt three full Years in Bute. During which space he was kep't safe and sound And under the Lord Stuart Shalter found. Till Waallce who won Scotland back with Pain, Restor'd him to his Livings all again. With many more who were all overthrown, By English, and restored unto their own. Wallace small Host of whom I spoke of late, Having the Rogue M?Fadzean now defeat Return'd unto the Field where they had fought, Got Arms and Spoil behind them left they nought. Thro' Lorn they march, as handsome as they can, And on their Number scarce had lost a Man. On the Fifth Day, unto Ardchattan went, Where they sound Wallace blyth, and well content, His Men he welcoms, highly sound their Praise, Who did behave themselves so well always. Take all the Spoil said he falls to my share, I fight for Honour, for no more I care. CHAP. III. How WALLACE won St. JOHNSTOUN. When Wallace quite had clear'd the Highland Coast, Kill'd the M?Fadzean, and defeat his Host: And wisely setled all Argyll, and Lorn. In spite of all that Rogues Contempt and Scorn. Nothing he long'd so much to see on Earth, As sweet St. Johnstoun, now the Town of Perth. Ramsay he calls, both trusty, true and kind, And there to him discloses all his Mind. Bonny St. Johnstoun on the River Tay, Where Suthron rule with arbitrary Sway, There Captive Scots I've set at Liberty, And made Ten English for one Scots Man Dy. But yet methink's I want sufficient Mends, Till I kill Thousands more, instead of Tens. I'll make them know they have no Right to rule, And cause them shortly all Sing up Port-yeull. That Town said Ramsay, long they cannot keep; The Walls are low, altho' the Ditch be deep, VVhich our good Men can very quickly fill, Then we may march a Thousand at our will. The Suthron Pride perhaps we then may quell, Wallace was pleas'd, and both rode to Dunkel. There, Three full Days, away their Time they past, And all their Projects, wisely did forecast. Ramsay caus'd make great big Machines of Tree, By the best Workmen could be had for Fee. And down the Water in a little Space, Does carry them, to the appointed Place. Then all the Host unto St. Johnstoun past, With Earth and Stone fill'd up the Ditches fast. Flaiks there they made of Timber fresh, and tight, Then to the VValls a Passage made on sight. Bastalies strong they suddenly up-rear, Then do advance with glitt'ring Sword and Spear. Sir John the Graham, and Ramsay that bold Knight, The Turret Bridge besiege, with all their Might. VVallace himself, with his good Men around. Doth take his Post, at Mid-Side of the Town. The Suthron much perplexed in their Minds, Defend themselves with new, and strange Engines. Wherewith they furiously, and very fast, Great Numbers of prodigious Stones do cast. Yet the brave Scots, that hardy still had been, With Swords, and Spears, that cliver were and keen At Handy blows no sooner with them met, Than in their Blood, their Weapons all were wet Tho' English there, like gallant Men and brave, Into that Conflict Boldly did behave: Yet suddenly they were put to the worse, The Scots upon them enter in by Force. A Thousand, o'er the VVall got speedily, Then in the Town rose a prodigious Cry. Ramsay, and Graham, such was their lucky Fate, Soon gain'd, then entred at the Turret-Gate. A Squire true, who Ruthwen was to Name, At that Assault was with Sir John the Graham. And Thirty Men who laid about them well, As to their Smart, the Suthron there did feel, Then the true Scots, came in upon all Sides, And bravely curry'd all their English Hides. Two Thousand there, they kill'd upon the Street, And in the Kennel tread beneath their Feet. VVhen Sir John Psewart, saw the Town was lost, He like a Coward fled, and left his Host: Then Sixty Men, in a light Barge, and he, Scour down the VVater, streight unto Dundee. Wallace abode till the Fourth Day at Morn, But left none there, that were in England born. Great Riches got, and ev'ry Thing was good And then the Town repeopl'd with Scots Blood. Ruthwen he left their Captain there to be, That Post by Right full well deserved he. He sundry Gifts got more in Heritage, His Service so did Wallace Heart engage. Thus after Wallace settled Matters so, He to the North prepares himself to go. In Aberdeen, he caus'd proclaim and Cry, That Scots men there should meet immediatly. To Couper rode, to view that Abbacy, From which the Abbot he thought fit to flee. Good Bishop Sinclair, without longer stay, Met him at Glams, and travell'd on the Way To Brechin; where, they lodged all that Night, Then on the Morn, Wallace by it was Light, Caus'd Noblemen, all in their rich Array, The Scottish Banner fairly there display. Then instantly proclaim'd upon the Spot, To kill all Sutheron where they could be got. In Battle Rank then thro' the Merns they march, And diligently after Suthron search. Who frighted all before the Host do flee, Unto Dunnottar standing in the Sea. To that great Strength, they all in Hast do throng Their Number then made up Four Thousand Strong. Some in the Church their Sanctuary took, The Rest march'd up all to the Craigy Rock. With whom the Bishop fairly treated so, To spare their Lives if from the Land they'd go. Like Fools, they on his Words would not rely, Therefore a Fire was brought speedily: Which burnt the Church and all those Suthron Boys Out o'er the Rock the rest rusht with great Noise. Some hung on Craigs, and loath were for to die, Some lap, some fell, some flutter'd in the Sea. And perish'd all, not one remain'd alive, What Man could think such Rogues could better thrive. When Wallace Men, saw them all dead and gone, They ask'd the Bishop Absolution. Wallace he thought their Fault it was but small, Then leugh, and said, I do forgive you all. Remember our brave Barrons hang'd in Air, What pity did the Suth'ron show us there? To Aberdeen then Wallace quickly past, Where English Men were flitting very fast. Numbers of Ships, resembling growing Woods, Lay in the Harbour to turse off their Goods. At an ebb Sea, the Scots did make a Trip. And seiz'd the Servants there of every Ship; Took out the Goods, the Ships they set on Fire, The Men on Land they burn'd both Bone and Lyre. The Priests, and Children, Maids and married Wives, They sav'd, and freely let pass with their Lives. To Buchan next, good Wallace he does ride, Where the Lord Bewmont order'd was to bide. Earl he was, but short Time made before, And after bruik'd it very little more. When he got notice Wallace was in view. Unto the Slains he privately withdrew. Took Shipping, and return'd to England back, Had little of his Government to crack. Wallace rode on both over Hight and Plain. At Cromarty hath many Suthron slain. And then returned back to Aberdeen, With his blyth Host, upon the Lambass Even. Where to his Friends a welcome Sight was he, Then with his Army march'd unto Dundee, CHAP. IV. How WALLACE laid Seige to Dundee, and gave Battle to Kirkingham Theasurer to King Edward, and the E. of Warran at Stirling Bridge. Wallace, his valiant Souldiers does oblidge, Most vig'rously the Castle to besiege. Wisely disposes all, no Time is lost, And to each Man assigns his proper Post. By this Sir Aymer, that unnat'ral Foe, In haste for England does prepare to go. Like to B?sh?te himself with pannick Fear, Packs up his Baggage, all his Goods and Gear. Among the Suthron like a poor Exile To lurk, and to abscond himself a While. There Wallace Actions all he doth relate, Which did oblige the English to regrate Their sad Misfortunes, and unlucky Chance, Which now had put their Measures to a Stance. Edward to Scotland could not go that Time, Yet still the more to aggravate his Crime: He, Kirkingham his Theasurer does command, And Earl Warrand, with a Numerous Band: Of Horse and Foot on Scotland for to fall, To worrie Wallace, and destroy up all. This numerous Host do march with all their Speed, The Earl Patrick them receiv'd at Tweed. Inveterate Malice who, 'gainst Wallace bore, As like a Rogue he always did before And to his Native Country now does strive, To work all Mischief that he can contrive. The English now a Muster do intend, And find their Host full Sixty Thousand Men. Then March they all streight unto Stirling Bridge, And in their Way, the Castle do Besiege. When of those News Wallace had got some taste, He then indeed bestir'd himself in Haste. A Captain plac'd, of Vigilance and Care, For to Command the Siege was lying there. Two Thousand good, in Number they would be, North-Country Men, and dwellers at Dundee. Then march'd his Men, all cliver Young and tight And in St. Johnstoun quarter'd that same Night. At Sheriff-Moor, them up in Order drew, Where narrowly he did them all review. Then with brave Air, spoke Sir John the Graham, The Glory of that noble ancient Name: Great Fates we have performed in the Field, With smaller Force, and stronger Foes made yeild, Who fight said Wallace, for just righteous Ends, God unto them Assistance always sends. Then, tho' the En'my were Ten Thousand more. Let's up and beat them, as we've done before. Near Stirling Bridge I purpose first to be, There to contrive some subtile Jeopardie. Wherein we may our Suthron Foes ensnare. So soon as the Fat-lugged Lowns come there. We'll keep the Bridge, with our true Men and stout They'r not acquainted with the Way about. Wallace sends Jop to tell, that Tuesday next, To fight the Suthron, was the Day prefixt. On Saturday, unto the Bridge they rode, Which was well join'd, with good plain Boards and broad. Watches he set about him ev'ry where, That none might know what he was working there. A cunning Carpenter, by Name John Wright. He quickly call's and fall's to work on Sight. Caus'd saw the Boards immediatly in Two, By the mid Trest, that none might over goe. On cornal Bands caus'd nail it very soon, Then fill't with Clay, as nothing had been done- The other End to stand, directeth there, On wooden Rollers, with great Art and Care. When one was out, that all the rest might fall The Carpenter below he caus'd withal. In a closs Cradle cunningly to sit; And loose the Pin when Wallace thought it fit. Which by one Blast, he of a Horn would know, Then to be sure, to let the Roller goe. The Day of Battle does approach at length, The English then advance with all their Strength. And Fifty Thousand march in Battle Rank, Full Six to one, yet Wallace never shrank. The rest they lay about the Castle-Hill. Both Field and Castle, thought to have at will, The worthy Scots together closs did bide, In the plain Field, upon the other Side. Hugh Kirkingham, the Van-Guard on led he, With Twetnty Thousand likely Men to see. The Earl Warran Thirty Thousand had, If all were good, the Number was not bad. Thus Fifty Thousand silly Suthron Sots. Proudly march up against Nine Thousand Scots. VVhen Kirkingham his Twenty Thousand Men, Had past the Bridge, quite to the other End: Some of the Scots, in earnest without Scorn, Thought it high Time to blow the warning Horn. But Wallace he, march'd stoutly thro' the Plain, Led on his Men, their Numbers did disdain. Till Warran's Host, thick on the Bridge did go, Then he from Jop did take the Horn, and blow: So loud, and shrill; he warned good John Wright, Who soon struck out the Roller with great Slight. Then all went down, when the Pin was got out, At which arose a fearfull Cry and Shout. Both Men and Horse, into the River fell, Honest John Wright did act his Part so well. The hardy Scots, with heavy Strokes and sore, Attack the Twenty Thousand that came o'er. Wallace, and Ramsay, Lundie, Boyd, and Graham, With dreadfull Strokes made them retire, fy Shame. The Suthron's Front they fought, all Face to Face, Who to their Jgnominy, and Disgrace, Did neither stand, nor fairly Foot the Score, But did retire, Five Aiker breadth and more. Wallace on Foot, with a great sharp Sword goes Amongst the very thickest of his Foes. On Kirkingham there such a Stroke he got, In spite of all his Armour and Mail-Coat, That killed him Dead: none durst him there rescue, Then to that valiant Captain bad Adieu. When Kirkingham Dead on the Spot to lye The Suthron saw; Then they began to fly. Who tho' they had fought it most bloody hot, Ten Thousand lost and left Dead on the Spot. The Rest they fled, was none durst stay behind, Succour they sought, but none at all could find. Some East, some West, and some fled to the North, Seven Thousand flutt'red all at once in Forth; Who from that River little Mercy found; For few escap'd, and most of all were drown'd. On Wallace Side, no Man was kill'd of Note, But Andrew Murray, a true hearted Scot. When Warran's Men, saw all was lost and tint, They fled as fast as Fire does from the Flint. Ne'er look'd about, nor once a Scotsman fac'd, But to Dunbar march'd in a Dev'lish hast. Thus Thirty Thousand English in a Word, Like Cowards fled, without one Stroke of Sword. Then Wallace Host pursu'd with all their might, Took up the Bridge, and loosed good John Wright. The Earl Malcom, from the Castle past. And with his Men, pursu'd the Suthron fast. Thro' the Tor-Wood, the Earl Warran fled, Where many of his Men got a cold Bed. He had the Rogue Corspatrick, for his Guide, With Whip and Spur they both away do ride. Streight to Dunbar, and left their scatter'd Host, Who in their Flight were all cut down almost. The Scottish Horse, they had pursued so, Were so fatigu'd, no further they could go. Wallace, and Graham, who still together rade, At Haddington, a mighty Slaughter made. Ramsay, and Boyd, Adam of Richardtoun. Richard of Lundie, all are lighted down: With them, Three Hundred brave Scots Cavalrie, Which Wallace was extreamly glad to see. The Earl Malcom, he was also there, Where, blyth and glad, all Sumptously fare; The Earl Warran, and Corspatrick are, By this Time safely got into Dunbar. Whom Wallace did most hotly there pursue, But missing him had little more to do Having at least, full Thirty Thousand slain, In the Pursuit, and upon Stirling Plain. In Haddingtoun he quarter'd all that Night, Then back for Stirling march'd by Morning Light. On the Assumption Day, this Battle's fought, Wher ethe brave Scots, have perfect Wonders wrought. Then after all, sure sicker Work to make, Of all the Barrons he an Oath does take. That as Scots Warden, they would him respect, And he with all his Pow'r would them protect. Sir John Montieth, who was of Arran Lord, Most readily unto it did accord. And faithfully himself by Oath he bound. To stand by Wallace, and defend the Crown. All those who freely would not thus comply, He caus'd be punish'd with Severity. Some put to Death, and some to Prison sent His glorious Fame thro' both the Kingdoms went. Soon after, by a Tyrant got Dundee, And yet the Men fled all away by Sea. The English Captains, that were free to stay, Their Castles left, and then stole all away. So that in Scotland, when Ten Days were gone, An English Captain there you could see none. Except in Roxburgh, and in Berwick Town, Which to reduce Wallace intended soon. That Time there was a Barron of great Fame, Who Chrystal Seatoun was unto his Name; He with the Suthron often did contend, And did in Jedburgh VVood himself defend. From the Scots Faith, to swerve he never would, No for a Million of King Edward's Gold. Heabotle who did Jedburgh then Command, VVhen he the Suthron saw expell'd the Land: He suddenly did from the Castle flee, With all his Men Seven Score in Company. Christal with Fourty Scots does him pursue, Most of the Men, and Captain there he slew. Great Store of Riches, Gold and houshold Stuff, From Suthron got, and purely swing'd their Buff Jedburgh he took, plac'd Ruthven Captain there, Brave Seatoun then to Lothian did repair. Of him hereafter, greater Fates and more You'll hear, then what he did to the Seven Score: And whoso please the Bruce's Book to read, Will see him fam'd for many a valiant Deed. Wallace does now consider and advise, Where to find out good Faithfull Men and Wise, Who by Experience did understand. Rightly to manage and govern the Land. Captains he made, and Sherriffs very good, Some of his own, and some of other Blood. His Cousin Crawford, Governour to be Of Edinburgh, and the Castle order'd he. Now Scotland's free, lives in great Peace and Ease, And Suthron are fled home to tost their Cheese. Wallace much like a Prince doth Rule and Reign Waiting a Time to get his lawful King, From Edward who keep'd him in London Town, Most wrongfully from his own righteous Crown. The End of the Seventh Book. The Eight BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. How WALLACE put Corspatrick out of Scotland. Five Moneths thus Scotland had Peace and Rest, From War, wherewith they were so much oppress'd. Then a Convention's call'd of the Estates, To settle Matters and end all Debates. And in St. Johnstoun are assembled all, Except Corspatrick, who did mock their Call. Then Wallace he address'd that Parliament, And humbly ask'd, if they would all consent: For to forgive Corspatrick what was past, Providing he would own his Fault at last; And swear Fidelity unto the Crown, To which they all consented very soon: A Letter then they speedily indite, And in most kind, and friendly Terms they write, Beseeching him, with handsome Complement, He would accept Share of the Goverment, Which kindly Message, all did prove in vain, He leugh, and it contemn'd with great Disdain. We have great need said he, now of a King, When Wallace he as Governour does Reign. That King of Kyle, I cannot understand, Of him I never held a Furr of Land That Bauchler think's and does believe it well, That Fortune she will never change her Wheel. As for you Lords, I let you understand, I'm not oblig'd to answer your Demand. As free I am in this Realm to reign, Lord of my own as either Prince or King. Great Lands in England there I also have, Whereof no Subject Rent of me can crave. What would you then, I warn you I am free, No Answer more your Letter gets from me. Back to St. Johnstoun this fine Speech is sent, And laid before the Lords of Parliament. At reading which, VVallace no Patience had, But storm'd, and star'd, as he'd been almost mad. Himself could not recover for a while, 'Cause in Disdain he call'd him King of Kyle. Then up he rose, and without more or less. Unto the Lords he did himself address. My Lords said he, there can be but one King, Who can at once over this Kingdom reign. If Earl Patrick take such Ways and Gates, And suff'rd be, thus to insult the States: I plainly think, and I shall add no more, We are in worse Condition then before, Therefore I vow to God, if that he be. In this Realm, one of us Two shall die. Unless he come, and own his lawfull King, 'Gaingst the false Title Edward takes to reign, His Taunt, and Scorn, he shall repent and rue, Who calls me King, that am a Subject true. He took his Leave of all the Council then, And march'd away with Two Hundred good Men. Towards Kinghorn does hasten very fast. And on the Morrow over Forth he past, Then in to Musselburgh does safely get, Where he with Honest Robert Lauder met. Who 'gainst the Crown did never yet rebel, And hated Edward, as he hated Hell 'Gainst Earl Patrick, was most glad to goe, Who to his Country was a Bloody Foe, Christal of Seatoun with his Men e'er long Came, and made Wallace full Four Hundred strong. A Squire Lyle, that did the Country ken At Lintoun he came up with Twenty Men. Told, that Corspatrick and his Men of War, From Cock-burn's-path, were marching to Dunbar. Come on said Lauder, let us faster ride, No no said Wallace, he'll our Bellum bide, Another Thing pray also understand, A hardier Lord is not in all our Land. By East Dunbar, they march'd, and tarry'd not, But Earl Patrick of them Notice got. Who in a Field near Innerweik did then, Draw up Nine Hundred able fighting Men. Wallace with his Four Hundred stout, and tight, Approached fast, and came within their Sight. Who fiercely up to Earl Patrick ride, Where they like Furies, fight on ev'ry Side. That Conflict was both terrible, and strong, On either Side, and did continue long. Much Scottish Blood was spilt, they sought so fierce More than with Pleasure I can here rehearse. But Earl Patrick left the Field at last, Some few with him to Cock-burn's-path they past. Towards Dunbar march'd Wallace, but was told, That no Provisions left were in the Hold. Nor Men of Worth the Castle to defend, When he that Story heard from End to End Dunbar he took, and no Resistance fand, Gave it to Christal Seatoun, to command. After the Earl, Wallace marches then, To Cock-burn's-path with him Three Hundred Men. Whom in a Range about the Park he led, To Buncle Wood, Corspatrick then he fled; Then out of that, to Norham passed he, When Wallace saw that better could not be: To Cald-Stream rode, and lodged upon Tweed, Then Earl Patrick made great hast and speed; And passed by e'er Wallace Men arose. To Etrick Forrest without resting goes: Into Cockholm, Corspatrick took him rest, Then for more Force Wallace march'd to the West The Earl Patrick, he goes by and by For England, seeking some more new Supply. To Bishop Beik he there complained sore, Whom Wallace had from Scotland chas'd before, Who all Northumberland, with great Surprise, Caus'd quickly with the Earl Patrick rise. Then order'd Bruce, likwise to Scotland go, To win his own, they coxed him up so. Made him believe Wallace set up for King, A most ridic'lous, and calumnious Thing. Whereas the whole Design he had in Hand, Was to bring Bruce, free Home to his own Land. Thus from Oyss Water to the River Tweed, An Host of Thirty Thousand pass'd with Speed. And from the Thames came Ships immediatly, To watch Dunbar, that none should them supply, With Twenty Thousand all bred up in War, The Earl Patrick does Besiege Dunbar. The Bishop Beik, and Robert Bruce did then, Abide at Norham with Ten Thousand Men. Then Wallace like a sudden Thunder Crack, Came with Five Thousand Scotsmen at his Back. All shining in their Armour clear and bright, For to rescue the Seatoun wise and wight. Then under Yester, that Night lodged he, Where Hay came to him with good Cavalry. Who in Down Forrest all that Time had been, And had the coming of the Suthron seen. Fifty good Men that Hay had with him there Corspatrick's Case to Wallace all declare. My Counsel is said Hay, you Battle give, It is a Pity he so long should Live. If with your Men you could him overset, Such Pow'r again he would not quickly get. Wallace he thank'd him for his Counsel kind, Yet after all, consulted his own Mind. By this Corspatrick caus'd a Fellow pass, Who told to Beik that Wallace coming was He of the Tidings was exceeding glad, Amends of him fain would he there have had. But more adoe, thro' Lammer-moor they rode, Near the Spot-moor in Ambush there abode. Most cunningly so closs together drew, That of their coming Wallace nothing knew. Then, which was worse did suddenly espy, Corspatrick marching very furiously, On a plain Field, with all his num'rous Host, Of whom the Braggadocio much did boast. Brave Seatoun who was a most welcome Guest, To Wallace his Assistance came in haste, Yet prudently the Scots concluded then. Themselves too few for Twenty Thousand Men: Jop musing also, did advise at length, That Wallace would retire into some Strength. To lose your Men great Folly were therefore, I'll goe with Speed, and quickly bring you more. A dang'rous Chase said Wallace, they may make, We are too near, such Counsel now to take. Therefore I'll never flee, nor yet give o'er, So long as I have one, against their Four, There's Twenty here with us this very Day, Would them attack, altho' I were away. If they be Numerous, we are stout, and Strong, Let's up and fight them for they'll neer stand long. CHAP. II. How Corspatrick brought into Scotland Bishop Beik and Robert Bruce, and how WALLACE gave them Battle and put them out of Scotland. Now Warlike Wallace 'gainst Corspatrick goes, And both the Armies fast together close. The bloody Battle quickly does appear, Each with his hashing Sword and piercing Spear; Against his Fellow furiously does ride, And Havock great makes there on ev'ry Side. Some were kill'd dead, some got their mortal Wound, Some from their Horses suddenly knock'd down. On Suthron Side, Five Thousand on the Spot Lay dead; the Scots did push so very Hot, And did their Front cut down so furiously, That all the Rest were on the Wing to fly. But Earl Patrick in the Wars expert, Keep'd still his Ground, and caus'd his Men take Heart. The Scottish Host, Men of renowned Fame, Did cut down cleanly all, where e'er they came. Wallace, and Ramsay, and the Graham worth Gold, Richard of Lundie, and the Seatoun bold, And Adam Wallace true of Riccardtoun; Both Hay, and Lyle, all Men of great Renown, Boyd, Barclay, Baird, and Lauder true and tight, Numbers of English-Men kill'd in the Flight. Yet Earl Patrick, fiercely still fought on, With his own Hand to death put many one. Then the brave Scots, so boldly him accost, Great Slops they made thro' all the English Host. The Suthron then, plainly began to flee. Till Bishop Beik approaching fast they see. The Ambush all at once does quickly then, Break up, consisting of Ten Thousand Men, Whom when good Wallace saw so fast appear, He thought it fit on Horse Back to retire. But yet his Men, together stuck so fast, Fain wou'd he try the Suthron as they past. He so surrounded was with this fresh Host, On either Side, that he was almost lost. The worthy Scots, so fiercely fought again, Of Beik's new Men, Abundance they have slain. The Earl Patrick, sturdily he fought, Thro' all the Throng and there, for Wallace sought. To whom he did in spite o's Coat of Mail, Give such a Blow as wounded him a deal. Then Wallace drew against that Traitor Lown A Stroke which mist him, but clove Maitland down. Who racklesly, betwixt the Two did pass; Such his hard Fate, and sad Misfortune was. Good Wallace now, he is left all alone, And quite surrounded by the Suthron, His Horse is stick'd, he's forced to alight, And fight on Foot, the best Way that he might. Who laid about him, without Fear or Dread, With his good Sword that Trusty was indeed, The Earl Patrick then, commanded soon, With Spears that they should bear good Wallace down. Who, like a Champion brave stood on the Field, Hew'd off their Heads and scorned for to yield. The worty Scots of this they little wist, Got to good Graham when they their Chiftain mist. Lauder and Lyle, and Hay, that were so wight, And Ramsay bold, that brave and gallant Knight. Lundie and Boyd, and Chrystal Seatoun true; Five Hundred Horse brought Wallace to rescue. Then in amongst them furiously they rade, Large Room about them quickly there they made. The Bishop Beik was trampled on the Ground, Without Respect unto his Lordship's Gown. E'er he got up a great deal there they slew, Then gallantly, brave Wallace did rescue. Upon a Horse they mounted him on Sight, Then to a Strength rode off with all their Might. Where he Four Thousand of his Men did find, To the great Satisfaction of his Mind. To Bishop Beik, Corspatrick does return, Curses Misfortune, and begins to mourn; When as he found Seven Thousand Men were lost, And kill'd that Day, for all the Bishop's Boast. Of Wallace Men Five Hundred kill'd I guess, But not one Chiftain, so he car'd the less. The Bishop Beik with what Men he had there Left Lammer-More and quartered elsewhere. Who when the Field of Battle he had past, To Wallace, all the Country flocked fast. Crawford of Edinburgh, brought with him on fight Four Hundred Men, all in their Armour bright. From Teviotdale came many a good Man, From Jedburgh also with what Speed they can. Sir William als the Lord of Douglass came, With Fourscore Men of most undoubted Fame. Two Thousand fresh new Men, do there propose, A full Revenge that Night upon their Foes. Wallace's Watches all good Men and true, Attentively the Suthron's Quarters view. Then after Supper Wallace quietly, To Lammer-moor march'd with his Cavalrie, Sir John the Graham, and Seatoun, that good Hand, Lauder, and Hay, Three Thousand did Command. The Rest himself most wisely he did guide, With him was Douglass, Ramsay, Barclay, Boyd. Richard of Lundie, a bold Man and stout, And Adam Wallace, whom no Man durst doubt. Who by the Time the Sun was come in Sight Surpris'd the English, unprepar'd for Fight. And furiously, with Sword in Hand cut down, Many a Proud and Saucie Suthron Lown Some rose confus'dly and some fled away, Some on the Ground were smored where they lay. Great Noise, and Cry arose, all round about, Then came Sir John the Graham both Bold and Stout; With his brave Men, all chearful, blyth and glad, At Sight of whom, Ten Thousand Suthron fled. Yet Bishop Beik, behav'd well in that Throng, And in the Fight continued very long. One Skeltoun there that was an English Knight, Before him stood, in shining Armour bright; To save his Lord, he fought most valiantly, Whom, there so soon as Lundie did espy; With his good Sword, a backward Stroak he gave Which kill'd the English Knight, both stout and brave. Then fled they all, no longer durst abide, Patrick, and Beik, away with Bruce do ride. Who with Five Thousand, took the readiest Way To Norham House; with all the Speed they may. The Scots, who were both able, young and tight, Pursu'd and kill'd great Numbers in the Flight. Thus Twenty Thousand Sutheron in a Word, In Flight, and Battle, perish'd by the Sword. Wallace returns from Norham, without more, But for the Bruce, his Heart was mighty sore. Whom he had rather seen the Crown enjoy, Than Master been of all the Gold in Troy. O'er Patrick's Lands, Wallace he marched fast, Took out the Goods, and Castles down did cast. He Twelve of them, that Methamis they call Broke quickly down, and them destroyed all. Within the Merse, and Lowthian left he none, To him belong'd, except Dunbar alone. To Edinburgh then, he march'd on the Eight Day, And on the Morrow, he without Delay, Unto St. Johnstoun very quickly past, And told the Barrons all from First to Last How sacredly he keeped had his Vow, And got a Master to Corspatrick now. VVho said of late, that he as free did Reign In this Realm, as either Prince, or King. Of what he's won, need's not great Boasting make, Let him come back, and now take up his Stake, Great Thankfulness the Lords did there express To Providence, for Wallace good Success. Then Wallace with an open lib'ral Hand, To Men deserving dealt the Rebel's Land. To his own Kin no Heritage gave he, But Offices that ev'ry Man might see, All he propos'd, was this one very Thing, The Nation's Peace, and Honour of his King. For which he would abide and stand the Law. So soon as he, his King and Master saw, Now Old, and Young, the Girl and the Boy; Have Peace and Rest, and clap their Hands for Joy. CHAP. III. How WALLACE march'd into England, and remained there Three Quarters of a Year, and returned without Battle. October now by this Time's almost past, And cold November is approaching fast. When to his Shifts, those News, King Edward puts, And do confound him to the very Guts. Yet by Corspatrick's Counsel, does intend, Once more, an Army 'gainst the Scots to send. Wallace informed, of their wicked Plots, Assembled quickly Fourty Thousand Scots: In Rosin-Moor, where he the Lords addrest, Edward he said our Nation's common Pest, Us to invade does threaten with bold Face, But, Faith I'll try if I can turn the Chace. And with an Host be first on English Ground, In spite of all the Subjects of his Crown. The Lords, they off'red very Chearfully; To march along with all their Cavalry; Wallace he thank'd them, thought it needless then, Choos'd of that Number Twenty Thousand Men. With Horse, and Harness, Weapons new and tight, Does them provide, and shining Armour bright. The Rest to march, he quickly did command, To their own Homes, and cultivat the Land. This Army's big enough for my Design, If we be all of one, and the same Mind. Then let us to it, either doe or die. Who fly's or yield's shall never ransom'd be. Our Kingdom's poor, wasted by Suthron Knaves We shall get Gold or honourable Graves. Then all the Host promis'd with Heart, and Hand, Closs to stand by him, and obey Command. VVith Wallace also, Earl Malcom's gone, A better Lord, and braver could be none; And Campbel kind, the good Knight of Lochow, To Suthron still a fearfull grievous Cow. Good Ramsay also, Honour to his Name, And the most valiant, good Sir John the Graham And Adam Wallace, whom no Man durst doubt And Robert Boyd, both trusty, true, and stout. Lundie and Lauder, and brave Auchinleck, Seatoun, and Hay, all Men of great Respect. This noble Host with Courage march away, To Broxes Field, in good and brave Array, VVhere VVallace made a little Haste and then, To Roxburgh Gate rode up, with Twenty Men. VVhere boldly he did call on Sir Ralph Gray, Told him for sieging now he could not stay. Therefore desired he would quickly please, To quite the Castle, and give up the Keys. If he refus'd, then swore before them all, At his Return, he'd hang him o'er the VVall. Then wheel'd about, back to his Army went, The like Command to Berwick quickly sent, VVith Sir John Ramsay, who dispatch'd on Sight; Then march'd the Host, all in their Armour bright; Began at Tweed and nothing spar'd they fand, But burn'd by Force thro' all Northumberland, All Durham Town, up in a Flame they sent, But Churches spar'd and Abbays where they went. Then unto York they march'd, without Delay, No Sin they thought it, there to burn and slay. For Suthron had committed the same Thing, VVhen they as Tyrants did in Scotland, Reign Forts and small Castles, Wallace did throw down. Burn'd to the Gates and Suburbs of the Town. About the Walls, full Fifteen Days they spent, And then at last, Edward to Wallace sent. A Knight, a Clerk, a Squire of the Peace, Intreating, that from burning he would cease. Who promise in King Edward's Name, and says, He should have Battle, within Fifteen Days. Good Wallace smil'd, and to the Gentlemen, With noble Air replyed briskly then. I'll both desist from Fire, and from Sword, For Fourty Days, if he but keep his Word. King Edward's Faith under his Seal they gave, That, in that Space, Wallace should Battle have. Who quickly did consent unto the Thing, Then they returned all unto their King. Who told that they, never as yet had seen, Such Men for Order, and good Discipline. Then spoke the King, when they were at an End, It Wisdom is, our En'mies to commend. They'r to be fear'd; as sure as shines the Sun, They will resent the Inj'ries we have done. Frighted I leave them here, to their new Plots, And do return unto the valiant Scots. Wallace from York did march the second Day, With his whole Host, in noble good Array. To the North-west, they peaceably go down, And pitch their Tents near to Northallertoun. Proclaim'd his Peace, and Mercats all to stand, For Forty Days, throughout all the whole Land. There Sir Ralph Rymount, secretly did boast, For to surprise good Wallace, and his Host. Of which, some Scotsmen private notice got, Then unto Wallace did reveal the Plot. Good Lundie then, he called to him there, And Hugh the Hay, of Lochartquart the Heir. Three Thousand Men, he quickly with him sent Then quietly out from the Host they went. The Men he took, that came to him of new, To be their Guides, for they the Country knew. Silence profound he order'd there to be, And then drew up the Host most privatly. Rymount, he with Seven Thousand did advance, Of English Horse, who there did proudly prance. The Ambush then, Bambusl'd all their Game, For with pel-mel the Scots upon them came. Three thousand whole, they quickly brought to Ground, And with a Vengeance there were all cut down. Sir Ralph himself, was sticked with a Spear, Then all the Rest in Hurry fled, with Fear. To Miltoun, where Wallace pursued fast, Great Numbers kill'd, and seiz'd the Town at last. Great store of Riches, he got in the Town, Wherewith it did so very much abound. Plenty of Victuals, Ale, and noble Wine Sent to his Host, a very Sweet Propine. They ate and drank, truss'd off their whole Desire, Broke down the Walls, and set the rest on Fire. Three Days he liv'd, at the Expence and Cost, Of Suthron, then returned to his Host. Caus'd cast a Ditch about him speedily To keep his Camp from sudden Jeopardie. VVhen English Men got Notice of this Thing, They from all Airts, ride straight unto their King, VVho lay at Pumfret, but his Parliament, Battle to give, would not at all consent. VVhich carri'd was, by most of all their Votes, Unless that Wallace, crown'd were King of Scots. But if on him, Wallace the Crown would take, To give him Battle, all would ready make. This Message quickly they to him dispatch'd, But in that Snare he was not to be catch'd. The Messengers he quickly did discharge, Out of his Presence in a mighty Rage. His Council call'd, and told them all the Plot, And treasonable Message he had got. It were said he, a too presumptous Thing, Against my Faith, to rob my righteous King. It's ne'er be said in Country, nor in Town; I'm such a Rogue, as to usurp the Crown. But still my King, and Country, I'll defend, Let GOD above reward me in the End. Some cry'd to crown him; some said the Consent Must first be had, of a Scots Parliament. Campbel the Knight, was there among the rest, Who in his Judgement, thought it truely best; To crown him King solemnly, for a Day, And put an End to Edward's long Delay. Which, when the Earl Malcom he did hear, Both he and People, all were very clear, Yet Wallace in his Mind abhor'd the Thing, Tho' all cry'd out, to crown and make him King. Then in short Terms he said it ne'er should be, Rest satisfy'd, you get no more of me. But if you please to let the Story pass, That I am crown'd, (tho' still the same I was) Assuredly we quickly then shall know, Whither, they do design to fight, or no. Then to the Messengers the News they bring, Make them believe Wallace was crowned King. Who like poor credulous and lying Sots, Affirm they saw Wallace crown'd King of Scots. Then said the Lords, he did so well before, Now when he's King he'll certainly do more. If we give Battle he's so Fortunate, We may repent it, when it is too late. Then spoke another, he must Battle have. Or wast our Land, ther's nothing else can save, Tho' all his Conquests first since he began, Nothing but Death ransoms an English-Man. Woodstock said, tho', we Fight and them Defeat, They've Men enough behind, that will debate; If Wallace be but safe, they do not care, Therefore, methinks more safe, and sure it were: To keep each Strength, Castle and walled Town, And save our Men; than to expose our Crown. Then all approv'd what Woodstock he did say, And cowardly the Battle did delay. Thus thro' their Falshood, and Subtility, Thinking that Wallace of Necessity: Thro' want of Food his Ground could never stand, But be oblidg'd to steal out of the Land: Advis'd the King, to cry the Mercats down, From Trent, to Tweed, in ev'ry Burgh and Town. That in the Bounds no Man should Victual lead, Under the pain of Death without remead. Wallace lay still, while Fourty Days were gone, Waiting to fight, but Battle got he none. The Scottish Banner then he did display, Trode under Foot the English Seal that Day. An ignominious, but deserving Thing, To such a base, and cowardly, false King. Then rais'd he Fire, burn'd Northallartoun, March'd thro' York-Shire, boldly up and down. Destroy'd that Land, as far as they could ride, Seven Miles about they burn'd on ev'ry Side. Proud Palaces, and Tow'rs, they did cast down, Gardens and Orchards there did all confound. Nothing they spar'd of all came in their Lurch, But Women, Children, and the Holy Church, To York they march, and then they very soon, With all their Force, closely besiege the Town. A strong Defence, they do prepare within, And they without, a grand Assault begin. CHAP. IV. The Siege of YORK. Wallace his Army does in Four divide, And then the Town invests, on ev'ry Side. Himself, with Lauder, that good cliver Hand, At the South Port, do take the chief Command. The Earl Malcolm, Noble, Stout, and Great, VVith valiant Boyd, commanded the VVest Gate. Campbel the Knight, and Sir John Ramsay brave At the North Gate their Post, assign'd them have. To the East Gate Wallace he does direct, Sir John the Graham, Crawford, and Auchinleck. One Thousand Archers of the Scottish Side, At the Four Gates caus'd equally Divide Full Seventeen Thousand Suthron, then appear, Upon the Walls with all their Bow, and Spear. Who furiously doe sally out, but got, A warm Reception, from each worthy Scot. In spite of all their Arrows and big Stones, Were driven back, with sore and Bloody Bones. Who, when they got within the Town at last, Faggots of Fire out o'er the Walls do cast. And great Prodigious red hot Gads of Iron, Which from old Nick their Master they did Learn. Hot burning Pitch, and scalding stinking Tar, And other curs'd Contrivances of War: Nevertheless, the Scots that were without, So valiant were, so hardy, and so stout. They fiercely burnt the Bulwark of the Town, Their Barmkin wan, and cast great Turrets down. The wearied Host with great Fatigue opprest, And Night approaching, think of taking rest, Most carefully, first, they wash ev'ry Wound, Their Watches set, and then sleep safe and sound. Next Day, their Cloaths were scarce well on their Back When all cry'd out, for a new fresh attack. Drew up again, as they had done before, And then the Town assaulted wondrous sore. The Scottish Archers all, so leilly shot, Numbers they kill'd, in Truth they miss'd them not. Then burning Fire set to ev'ry Gate, So mortally they did the Suthron hate, Yet notwithstanding, the fierce English Men, Themselves, and Town, did gallantly defend. When that whole Day was spent, and come the Night, To his Pavilion went each weary Wight. The English then with Vigilance and Care, For a fresh Sally do themselves prepare. Sir William Mortoun, and Sir William Lies, Most cunningly they draw up by Degrees. And make a fearful, furious Sally then, On Earl Malcom, with Five Thousand Men. Wallace himself, as he rode the Grand-round, Seeing them coming, caus'd a Trumpet Sound. The Harnish'd Scots that keeped Guard that Night, Took the Alarm, then mounted all on Sight. Then briskly charg'd the cruel Suthron Foe, With Sword in Hand, and many a Bloody Blow. Wallace, who knew the Earl was too hot. That he would fight tho' dye upon the spot. Up to him rides, as quickly as he may, With a good Sword, that paved well his Way, The first he struck, fell dead upon the Place, The Second's Nose, he levell'd with his Face. The hardy Earl, did no Suth'ron spare, But hew'd them down, and left them crawlling there. By this the Host, were all in good Array, And Suthron thought 'twas Time to march away. Wallace knew well, they could not stand it long, Wherefore he thrust into the thickest throng. And cliverly, so laboured their Buff, Their Armour did not signify a Snuff. The Scotsmen there behav'd extreamly well, As the poor Suthron sensibly did feel. Then all the English left the Field and fled, And Sir John Mortoun he was killed Dead. Twelve Hundred more, upon the Field are slain, The rest fled back unto the Town again. And then good Wallace with his valiant Host. Return'd, each Man unto his proper Post. And took them Rest, wherewith so fresh they grew, They on the Morn assault the the Town of new. Against the City all their Force do bend, And fight, as if they had been more then Men. But now their Victualls to be scarce begin, Tho' little knew the Englishmen within. Who that same Day, a Parley caus'd be beat, At which good Wallace did appear in State. Attended by some of his chiefest Friends, And boldly asketh, what the Parley means. To whom, the Major in Name of all did say, We'll pay a Ransom, if you'll march away. We would give Battle, or do any Thing, Would purchase Peace; but dare not for our King. Then with a Countenance austere, and bold, VVallace reply'd we value not your Gold. Your King he promis'd, we should Battle have, VVhich Faithfully under his Seal he gave. The Major did then reply most Courteously, He is the King, and we but Subjects be. Therefore we pray, as you would us oblige, To take our Gold and do remove the Siege. Then with his Council he consulted long, VVho thought the Town, for Siege was too too strong. And Victualls scarce, therefore it safer found, To take some Gold, then march for Scottish Ground VVallace reply'd, I'm not all content, Unless the Town give us their whole Consent: To let our Banner blow upon their VVall, And there to flourish, in the sight of all. This Answer soon was sent unto the Major, VVho did consent, with all the rest were there. The Banner set, to Scotland's great Renown, Upon the VValls from Eight, to Twelve at Noon. Then was Five Thousand Pound of English Gold, Pay'd down in Specie, to that Army bold, Good Bread, and VVine, they gladly to them gave, And all Provisions that they pleas'd to have. Twenty long Days, at York remained they, Then gloriously in Triumph march away. Unto the Country back again they'r gone, Burn'd, and broke down fine Buildings, spared none. All Myldlame they burn'd up into a Fire, Broke down the Parks, destroyed all the Shire. Wild Deer they slew, for other Beasts were none, And fed like Princes on good Vennison. Toward the South, they turned at the last, Made Buildings bare, as far as e're they past. The Commons now, for London all design, Where they most freely, tell the King their Mind. Unless from Wars, he would cause Wallace cease. They'd take Protection, and accept his Peace. No Herauld then, durst unto Wallace go, The King, to him his Faith had broken so. And Edward, that was once, so bold, and pert, His Army now, does cowardly desert. So long in England, there was never one. Since Brutu's Death except Wallace alone That march'd from England, without stroke of Sword; Fy on the King, that broke his royal Word. Great Julius for all his Strength and Force, Was chas'd from England twice, and got the worse, With Arthur als, first when the Wars he priv'd, Twice did they fight, altho' they were mischiev'd. But awful Edward, durst not Wallace bide, In a plain Battle, for all England wide. In London lay, at his own Ease and Rest, And brake his Vows, which of them think you best. Wallace's Host, for Scotland, long to go, So scarce the Victuals, every Day did grow. Immediatly good Wallace calls for Jop, In him, was all his Confidence and Hope; Next unto GOD; because he knew the Land, And still was ready to obey Command. Who said, if you'll advised be by me, The Plentiest part of England you shall see. Good Wine, and Wheat, you'll get in Richmond Shire, And each Thing else unto your Heart's Desire. Thither they went, their Time did not purloyn; Nine Thousand Scots, did there with Wallace joyn. All swinging, able, lusty, well look'd Men, He, and his Host had great rejoicing then. Into that Shire, Plenty had of Food. Both tame, and wild, and ev'ry Thing was good. Throughout that Land they march'd, in good array, A handsome Place then found upon the Way; Ramswatch to Name, then Jop, to Wallace told Fechew was Lord and Captain of that Hold. Five Hundred there, quickly assembled then, To save their Lives and Goods from Wallace Men A noble House, stood by the Forrest Side, VVith stately Turrets, in great Pomp, and Pride. VVell built about for Strength, ingeniously, VVith Five great Towers that mounted very high Numbers of Men, upon the VValls are seen, Bravading in their Armour, clear and clean, The Host march'd by, not one VVord said at all, But they within, aloud on VVallace call. Their Trumpets blew, with many a warlike Sound, Then Wallace said, had we yon Gallants down. On a plain Ground; they should get Sport their fill, Such as his Brother got on Tinto Hill. Sir John the Graham would at the Bicker be, But Wallace soon the Danger did forsee. Commanded him, to let alone his Haste, We have no Men so foolishly to waste. But yet to gratifie your fond Desire, Our first Attack, shall be with burning Fire. I see their Bulwark of old with'red Oak, Were that one Fire it would not bide a Stroke. Houses, and Woods, in plenty here there be, Who hews best of this Forrest let me see. Pull Houses down, let each Man take his turn, Old Timber, will make green Wood bravely burn. At his Command most busily they wrought, Great store of Wood unto the Place they brought. The Bulwark won, then closly at the last, Unto the Barmkin, heaps of Timber cast. The Bow-Men fiercely shot, on ev'ry Side, But Suthron worsted were for all their Pride. Women and Children, on their Knees do fall, And loud for Mercy, do on Wallace call. So pitiful he was, tho' bold, and stout, He heard their Crys, and let them safely out. Then Fire, and smoak, in fearfull Clouds arose, And burning Flames, all round their Castle goes. Barrels of Pitch, which stood long there before, VVent all in Flame, the Mischief was the more. Both Man, and Beast, are are all burn'd up with Fire, Thus Wallace Host have got their Hearts Desire. Fechew himself, smother'd with Smoak, and Smell, Lap from a Hight, and on the Barmkin fell; VVith a good Sword, Wallace struck off his Head, Five Hundred more were choak'd, and burned dead. On the next Day, the Fire being spent, Wallace's Men, unto the Castle went. Struck down the Gate, and took what they could find, Jewels, and Gold, great Riches to their Mind, Spoiled the Place, and nothing else left there, But Beasts, burnt Bodys, and great Buildings bare. Then Wallace, to the Widow of Fechew Said; promise here, as you'r a Woman true, Wo turse your Husband's Head, to London Town, And tell King Edward, if he do not soon Give Battle, I doe swear by all the Fates, This Moneth once, to be at London Gates. For if he keep not's faithful VVord to me, All the South-west of England I shall see. To London Town then without more she went, VVhere Edward lay, displeas'd, and ill content. His Nephew's Head, did him with Anguish fill, And more and more, increas'd his Sorrows still. With great unease, upon his Feet he stood Weeping, and wailing, for his tender Blood. Then rose the Council, praying him to cease, We England lose, unless we purchase Peace. Woodstock, for Peace was clear, then in the End, The King consents and bids a Message send; No Man the Message there would undertake, Because the King so oft his Faith did break. The Queen, when she saw all refuse the Thing, Down on her Knees she fell before the King. Soveraign she said, if it your Pleasure be, I pray, permit me Wallace once to see. Perhaps he may do more for Women far, Than for your Men that mind him still of War. If with him I prevail not very soon, I may return with little Dammage done. The Lords were glad the Queen was minded so, And humbly beg'd the King, to let her go. To which the (King altho' much discontent,) And backward to it, did at last consent. Some said the Queen did Wallace much admire, Who daily so much Honour did acquire, And in her Heart by far, did him prefer To most of Men, for his brave Character. And that she lov'd him; but till once they meet I'll pass no Judgement, 'tween themselves Two be't: Mean Time she's march'd, (to leave our Drolls and Jests,) With Fifty Ladies and Seven ancient Priests. Now Edward, for Fechew does sigh, and mourn, But unto Wallace, I must now return. The worthy Scots, among the Suthron ride, And great Destruction make, on ev'ry Side. The Host was glad, and blest their happy Fate, No Force there was, that durst with them debate. Riches, and Gold, they got their very fill, And ev'ry Thing they pleas'd at their own Will. South they are march'd, and to St. Albans gone, In all that Country, Damage did they none. The Prior sent them Vennison and Wine, Refresh't the Host, and made them bravely Dine. The Night appeared shortly in the Place, Then pitch'd their Tents from thence a little Space. Into a Valley, by a River fair, Where Hart, and Hynd, on either Side repair, Their Watches set, all in good Order keep, To Supper went and in due Time did sleep. CHAP. V. How the Queen of England came to speak with WALLACE. Upon the Morrow, Wallace quickly rose, To take the Air, out of his Tent he goes. And then the good, and reverend Mr. Blair, For Morning Service, quickly does prepare. Wallace most nobly did himself array, In shining Armour, Glorious and Gay. It's several Parts, are needless to rehearse, From Top, to Toe, he look'd exceeding fierce. Boyd, Adam Wallace, wait on him with Speed, Along a River thro' a Flowry Mead. Thus, on the Eields all pleasant sweet and green, Fetching a walk, they spy the English Queen. Towards the Host riding, most soberly, With Fifty Ladies in her Company. And Seven old Priests, Religious, Grave and Wise, Who in all Matters did the Queen advise. To the Pavilion with the Lyon, all Ride, then light down and on their Knees do fall. Praying for Peace, with many a piteous Tear, Lord Malcom said our Chiftain is not here. Pray Madam rise, a Queen I'll not allow, Unto a Subject on her Knees to bow. Then did he lead her by the tender Hand, To Wallace, where, he like a Prince did stand. So soon's she saw him, she began to kneel, Then Wallace did a mighty Passion feel. He her embrac'd, and kiss'd, but did no more, The like to Suthron, he ne'er did before. Then smiling, softly whisper'd in her Ear, Madam, how please you our encamping here. Sir very well, but we your Friendship, need GOD grant we may in this our Errand speed. Madam, I must remove a little Space With this Lord; then I'll wait upon your Grace. To the Pavilion, both they do repair, And very quickly call a Council there, Where he enlarg'd, on Women's Subtilty, How by their cunning, Men may tempted be, On pain of Death, therefore your Men Command, Or to their highest Perill let them stand, That none with them converse, but such as born Of high Blood are, and to this Counsel sworn. This, out in Orders thro' the the Army's gone, To ev'ry single, individual one. Then to the Queen, he and the Earl went, And Courteously, conduct'd her to the Tent. Went to a sumptuous, noble Dinner then, All serv'd with stately, handsome Gentlemen. Some of her chiefest, royal Dainties there, The Queen pull'd out, and kindly bid them share. Of ev'ry Thing, she first did taste and prieve, No Poison's here, my Lords you may believe. Soon after Meat, all did themselves absent, Excepting those, that to the Counsel went. Mean while the Ladies, did the Queen attend, Untill the Counsel over was and then, Good Wallace quickly waited on the Queen, And calmly ask'd, what did her Journey mean. Peace, said the Queen, we have no other thought, This raging War, hath such Destruction wrought. Then grant it Sir, for his sake dy'd for us, Madam, we cannot lightly leave it thus. You ask no peace, but for your own self Ends, That cannot make us a sufficient mends. For the unjustice, done our Royal Prince, The breach of Faith, and Blood shed ever since. These wrongs she said, ought all to be redrest, But Wallace still, the more for Battle prest. The Queen she answer'd, with great Modesty, Peace now were best, if it might purchas'd be; For which if you a Truce with us will take, Thro' England all, we shall cause Prayers make; That Matters go not on, from bad to worse. Compelled Prayers Madam have no Force, Before that they get half way to the Heav'ns, I hope for Mends, then shall we all be ev'ns. Then to the Queen did all the Story tell, At Alexander's Death, what us befell. How Bruce, and Balliol, long Time did contend Who should be King, at length did condescend And did the Matter to a Ref'rence bring, To the Decision, of her Lord, and King. And how unjustly Edward did decide, And then usurp the Crown, thro' Hellish pride In short he told her all the Story o'er, As I have told you in my Book before. How Edward made him Prisoner at Air, Broke a strict Truce, and hang'd our Barrons there, How Hesilrig, kill'd his beloved Wife. And therefore would hate Suthron during Life. The Silver Tears, (great Pity to behold,) Came trickling down, when he his Tale had told The Queen, with Wallace so did sympathize. The Tears that Moment, blinded both her Eyes. Curs'd Days she said that Hisilrig was born, On his Account, many are now forlorn. As Queen or Princess Madam then said he, She in her Time, was full as dear to me. Wallace she said, from this Discourse we'll cease, The Mends thereof, is Prayer and good Peace. Three Thousand Pound, she down before him told, All of the finest and true English Gold; Such Tribute Madam, now we do not crave, Another Mends of England we would have. For all the Gold and Riches, of your Reign, I'll grant no Peace, in absence of your King. When she saw Gold, nothing would Wallace move, Then sporting said, Sir you are call'd my Love I've ventur'd here my Life laid at the Stake, Methinks you should do something for my sake; In love you Suth'ron, with your subtile Cracks, One Thing pretends, and the quite contrair acts. With pleasant Words, you and such Ladies fair, Would us decoy like Birds into a Snare, We'll take our Chance, whatever may befall, No flattering Words, nor Gold, shall tempt us all. At which, a rosey Blush her Cheeks did fill, Dear Sir she said, pray let me know your will; For solemnly I here to your protest, I think a Truce, would for us both be best; With Ladys, Madam, Truce I cannot make, Least your false King hereafter do it break. Then have we none, but Ladys to reprove, That shall not be, by him that sits above. The whole Affair he on himself shall take, Of Peace, or War, what e'er we chance to make. The Queen she said, it was sufficient, To which the rest did freely all consent. Yet sorry was she and did blush for Shame, That she obtain'd not all for which she came. Unto the Host, the Gold she freely gave, To ev'ry one, that pleased for to have. When Wallace saw, what ev'ry one had got. He said, that Kindness should not be forgot. We you assure, our Host shall nothing Act, Till you a Message, from your King send back. Your Heraulds also, hither to and fro, May likewise very safely come and go. She and her Ladys, thank'd him then and drank, To Wallace, and the Lords of ev'ry Rank, Her leave she took, no longer there abode, Five Miles that Night unto a Nunn'ry rode. And on the Morn, to London travell'd they, To Westminster, where King and Counsel lay. Wallace's Answer show'd, and did report, Most nobly of him, both to King and Court. Upon his Wit, and Manhood, did comment, His Freedom, Truth, and martial Government. More Chiftain-like he's in his Armour seen, Than ever yet I think in England's been. From Honour he, (on which he's so much bent,) Will not retract, for all the Kingdom's Rent. Then purchase Peace, and I shall add no more, Or else all England may repent it sore. Mean Time, unto your Heraulds he gives leave, To come and go, and no Man dare them grieve. The King and Council, in their Minds were eas'd, Thanked the Queen, and all were bravely pleas'd Then all concluded, it was only best, To take a Truce, else they would get no Rest. Then do dispatch a Herauld wise and grave, To whom safe Conduct Wallace frankly gave, Then Clifford, Bewmont, Woodstock, doe procure, To treat with Wallace a most ample Pow'r. Thus these Three Lords, to him ride all in State, Where subtilly Woodstock did there debate. To which good Wallace did reply again, You speak in Sophisms, but I'll tell you plain; Roxburgh and Berwick, you must us restore Which was our Right and Heritage bofore. Also we ask, by Vertue of this Bond, Our Native King so long keep'd from his own. Those you shall grant, on your King's Faith to me To which, on Sight the Lords did all agree. The Randal Young' whom there he did demand, And the Lord Lorn, were granted to his Hand. The Earl Buchan, tender but, and Young He did obtain for the wind of his Tongue. Cumming, and Souls, he caus'd deliver als, Who, after to King Robert, proved false. Vallance for fear, durst scarcely keep his Bed, But like a Thief, to Pickardie he fled. The noble Bruce alas was gone away, Before that Time, to Calice many a Day, Unto his Uncle Glocester; which Thing, King Edward prov'd, so Wallace wants his King: The Earl Patrick, who at London stay'd, No more Allegiance to King Edward pay'd. But unto Wallace speedily came down, And held his Lands all of the Scottish Crown. An Hundred Horse, with brave Scots Noblemen, Came trooping gladly all to Wallace then. Under his Seal King Edward then did send, And caus'd deliver, to the Scottish Men, Roxburgh, and Berwick, Five Years Peace ensues, To ancient Scotland, great and glorious News. Which unto Wallace quickly was sent down, And fairly sign'd, closs by Northallertoun: To Bamburgh, came the Scottish Army then, Which did consist of Sixty Thousand Men. To Carham Moor, came all in good Array, With Hearts rejoicing upon Lambmass Day. The Priest next Day, in Church did Wallace please, Deliver'd him, Roxburgh and Berwick Keys. Berwick, to Ramsay he gave, on the Spot, And noble Seatoun, Roxburgh Castle got. With Earl Patrick, Wallace without more, Rode to Dunbar, and there did him restore. Scotland all o'er, from Rosss to Sollway Sand, Wallace he did give Statutes to the Land. Unto the Lennox then, he did repair, Sir John Montieth, that Time was Captain there. And twice before had Wallace Gossip been, Yet now no Friendship was betwixt them seen. Upon a Rock a House he founded there, Then to the March he did again repair. In Roxburgh then, he choos'd a handsome Place, And built a Tow'r within a little Space. Jop twice he sent to Bruce of Huntingtoun, Beseeching him to come, and take the Crown. Such counsel of the Saxons false took he, In all his Life, he Wallace ne'er did see. Three Years the Kingdom, Quiet had and Rest, And ev'ry Man, his own with Peace possest. Here Ends the first Conquest of Scotland. The Ninth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. How the King of France wrote to WALLACE by his Herauld, and WALLACE's Answer. The King of France, hearing of Wallace Name, His mighty valiant Acts, and glorious Fame; In's royal Mind, did long most vehemently, This much renown'd Scots Champion to see. Wond'red how Wallace, with so small a Pow'r, Made English Men, before him fly, and scour. And force their Malice, spite of Hell to cease, Then pitifully truckle for a Peace. The King a Herauld calls, and without more, To Wallace writes, as to a Conqueror. Beloved Sir, Worshipfull, Wise, and Wight, Restorer of thy native Land's true Right. In the Defence of righteous, royal Blood, For which, thou always loyally upstood. Old Prophecy, which did thy Birth adorn Said; happy Scotland, that Time thou was born. I do beseech with all Humility, Thou wilt accept my Letter graciously. Give Credit, and believe in any Ways, What e'er my Herauld from me, to thee says. The Herauld bow'd, and to the Ship is gone, And then in Scotland does arrive anon, Went Straight unto Sir William Wallace, where, He found him in the ancient Town of Air. The Letters humbly in his Master's Name, To VVallace does present, and he the same, Most courteously upon his bended Knee, Receiv'd from him, in all Humility. The Herauld then made him to understand, All that his Master gave him in Command. Your Valour Sir, and Honour all do own, And to the King my Master's so well known: That he intends, your Worship to advance As high, as any Subject born in France. Wallace reply'd, as GOD my Soul shall save, A speedy Answer you shall quickly have. The Herauld stay'd with Wallace, Twenty Days, And was Regal'd, with Feasting, Sport, and Plays. Then Courteously, Wallace wrote to the King, A satisfying Answer to each Thing, Unto the Herauld, Presents rich he gave, Then to the Sea convey'd him and took leave. Wallace his Voyage soon intends for France, Prepares fit Equipage, and Purveyance. Good Lord James Stuart, Scotland's Stewart then, Made Governour till he return'd again. At Rochel now, the Herauld does Arrive, A blyther Man, sure there was none alive. To Paris went, then peerless for Renown, The King thought well, Wallace was come to Town. Asked the Herauld with Concern, anent Old Scotland's Welfare, and how Matters went. Saw thou brave Wallace, Chiftain of that Land, Yes Sir said he a Man of great Command. In all my Travells, wheresoe'er I've gone, A braver Knight sure saw I never one. Great Worship there, and Honour's to him pay'd, His piercing Eye, almost made me afraid. With rich Rewards, and Presents as you see, For your Grace Sake, he complemented me. Here is his Answer, then the King was glad, Most graciously receiv'd it, and it read. Most Royal Sir, and righteous crowned King, Of great Renown, your Herauld here does bring; A Letter writ by my unworthy Hand, In Answer to your Majestie's Command: You well do know how Scotland's daily vex'd, And by our neighb'ring Nation sore perplex'd. No Bands will bind them, but with open Face, Do break their Faith, to Christian's great Disgrace, On which Account, I pray Sir, understand, I scarce dare leave this poor distressed Land. Yet by GOD's Grace, if living that I be, Within a Year your Majesty I'll see, O how this Answer greatly pleas'd the King, Who was as blyth as Bird upon the Wing. CHAP. II. How WALLACE went to France, fought the Red-River, and took him Prisoner. Toward his Voyage, Wallace does advance And at Kirkcudbright shipping takes for France. With Fifty brave, stout Scottish Gentlemen, Above what I describe can with my Pen. 'Mongst whom, were Four of his own Kinsmen near, Two Wallaces, Crawford and Cleland dear. Drank their Bonalies, in good Wine and Ale, Then cheerfully, for Sea hois'd up their Sail. Sail'd that whole Day, and all the following Night. Then on the Morn, when the Sun shined bright. The Ship Master, sprang quickly up a Rope, Where suddenly he spy'd, from the main Top, Sixteen great Ships, that boldly up did bear, And towards him a steady Course did steer. In colour Red, which with the Sun-shine bright, The Sea all o'er illuminat with Light. At which the Master almost fell a Swoon, Affrighted sore, he quickly then came down. Alas said he, that ever I was born! Without remead, our Lives are all forlorn. Curse on the Time that I did take in Hand, This Voyage, O! that I were back at Land, And buried were into some lonely Grave, So Wallace Life with Honour I might save. Master, said Wallace what needs all this Moan, Oh Sir here's Sixteen Sail against our one. Him that Commands, nought but our Blood will please, He Sixteen Years has been King of the Seas. Then Wallace ask'd, wot's thou what he may be, The Red-River, a Tyrant strong is he. He saveth none, for Gold or other good, But kills, and drowns all, in the brynie Flood. Since better may not be I pray thee Show, Some Mark said VVallace, how I shall him know; The Master said, at first Sight you will ken, And soon may him distinguish from his Men. A handsome, proper Man, as is in France, And of a Manly Scottish Countenance. Taller than any of his Men a deal And cloath'd in Scarlet, 'bove a Coat of Mail. The foremost Ship that does pursue us so, Himself is in, and that you'll quickly know. When he comes near, he boldly will you hail, Then speedily be sure to strike your Sail. He'll enter first himself most hardily, These are the Signs that you shall know him by. A Bar of Blew, into his shining Shield, A Bend of White desiring ay the Field. The Red betokens Blood, and Hardiness, The White his Courage, strongly doth increase. The Blew he wears, 'cause he's a Christian. Then Wallace said, he must be no good Man. For sure I am, this is no Christian Deed, Get you below, may the great GOD us speed. The Shipmaster, and the Steer Men also, He made go down, into the Hould below. His Fifty Men who were the very best, That he could choose, soon were in Armour drest. Fourty and Eight, closs on the Deck caus'd lye, On William Craford, then in haste did Cry: When the Red Reaver hails us, strike amain, At my command hale up the Sail again. Dear Cousin Cleland, take the Helm in Hand, Here on the Deck closs by thee I will stand. May the great GOD, us and our Ship, both Guide, The Reaver's Barge came then closs by their Side. Himself he stood aloft, with a drawn Sword, And bade the Steers-Man, lay enlong the Board. Aloud he cry'd, strike Dogs or you shall dye, Crawford let down the Sail then speedily. The Captain ent'red first no way's aghast, Then Wallace gripp'd him, by the Gorget fast: And threw him down on the Deck where he stood, While Mouth and Nose, all gushed out of Blood. A dagger Knife, Wallace in hast drew out, Then with pale Face, the Reaver look'd about; Mercy he cry'd, for him that dy'd on Rood, To Mend my Life; That have spilt so much Blood In La[illeg.] Tongue, to Wallace then said he, For God's sake Sir, pray grant my Life to me. His Weapons all, Wallace did quickly take, Him by the Hand did lift, and Pris'ner make. Then made him swear, on his sharp Sword, and Long, From that Day forth, he never should him wrong Command thy Men said Wallace, to the Peace, And quickly cause their shot of Guns to cease. A Glove, the Reaver held up on the Spot, Seeing the Sign, his Men forbore their Shot. His largest Barge, to him he then did call, Give over War, our true Friends these are all. Then asked at what Port Wallace would be, Unto the Rochel, quickly answer'd he. The Reaver, bids his Men to Rochel steer, They tack about, when his Command they hear. Wallace said pray what Country Man art thou, A French Man Sir, and my Fore-fathers too. Wallace then ask'd, how came thou to this Life, By the Mischance Sir of a sudden Strife. At Court, I kill'd a Man dead at one Stroke, Which did the King most hainously provoke. Thro' Friends in Court, I 'scaped off that Place. And since could ne'er obtain his Royal Grace. To Burdeous, thereafter made a Trip, And on a Night, did sieze an English Ship. Ill Doers to my self I soon got moe, And in a little multiplied so. That I, these Sixteen Years have rung at Sea. And shed much Blood, for which, Oh! Wo is me. And now, for the great Mischiefs I have done, In spite of Fate, I'm vanquished by one. Thus I confess, to my Eternal Shame, My Bloody Life: But pray Sir what's your Name. That with your own, single but valiant Hand, Does me and all my Sixteen Sail Command. None but brave Wallace the Scots Champion sure, Could thus have baffled me, and all my Pow'r; None else I know, encounter me should dare It were great Honour to Serve in his War, Then Wallace smiling answ'red modestly. Scotland had need of many such as thee. What is thy Name, thinks VVallace wants a Peel, Monsieur said he, Thomas of Longeveil. Well bruick thy Name, yea here shall end our strife, If thou'll repent and mend, thy bypast Life. For which thy faithfull Friend I'll ever be, I'm that same Wallace, whom thou now does see Upon his Knees then Longoveil fell down, As Wallace had been King, that wears the Crown. That I'm fall'n in your Hands, I'm pleas'd much more, Than I had gotten Florins Sixty Score. Wallace reply'd, since thou are here by chance, And that the King, has sent for me to France. I'll tell him, that for my Reward I want, Thy Peace, and Pardon, which I hope he'll grant. Could you my Peace obtain, Longoveil says, Most faithfully, I'd serve you all my Days. No Service Thomas shalt thou give to me. But such good Friendship, as I'll keep with thee. With that they fill'd the Wine, and merry made, And upon Sight, were in the Rochel Rade. Now now the Town, is in a sudden Fear, When the Red-Reaver, and his Ships appear. Some Ships they fled and others run ashore When Wallace saw they frighted were so sore: He did command, none in the Hav'n should go, But his own Barge, which pleas'd the People so That they no sooner, the Red-Lyon saw, In the Scots Banner, but they gave Huzza. Let up the Port, receiv'd them in the Town, VVith great Respect, then entertain'd them round. Wallace they saw a goodly Scottishman, And honour'd him, with all Respect they can. Four Days he tarried, at the Rochel, then, Gave strict Command to Longoviel his Men, That they discreetly would behave, and well And nothing act, that might be thought hostile; For shortly he, would either send or bring, Unto them all, a Pardon from the King. Your Captain to the King shall go with me; By help of GOD, I shall his Warrand be, Like his own Men, he cloathed Thomas so, There was no Man that Longoveil could know. Both blyth and glad, as any Men alive, They march, and then at Paris do arrive. In splendid Order to a Garden went, Then gallantly before the King present. Fifty and Two, upon their Knees do fall, Salute the King most fine, like Princes all. Their Speech they do govern, and so well rule, As they'd been taught at Julius Cæsar's School. The Queen got leave (so curious was) to see, Brave Wallace, and his goodly Company. The King he dines, as did the Court also, Then after Meat, does to the Parlour go. He, and his Lords, commun'd on ev'ry Thing, With Wallace who did greatly please the King; In Latine Tongue, his Answer did advance. With a Serene, and Manly Countenance, The King he ask'd, where the Red Reaver was, And marvell'd how that Tyrant let him pass. You with the Herauld might have writ to me, For Power to convey you thro' the Sea. I thank you Sir, no need thereof had we, Blessed be God, we're all safe as you see, Then said the King, Wallace, I wonder much, You have escap'd that Bloody Tyrants Clutch. Who on the Sea, such Cruelties has wrought, Could we him get he should not 'scape for nought. Thomas he quak'd, began to count his Beads, When as the King, related his Misdeeds. Wallace gave Ear, but feigned in some part, Forsooth said he we found none in that Airt: But Sir, with leave, would ye the Reaver know, Fy, since I saw him, it is long ago. These Words of yours, Wallace, are all in vain, E'er he come here many he'll cause be slain. Then Wallace said, great Sir of my Men all, Who is the Man, likest to him you'd call. The King reply'd, with a quick piercing Eye, That large long Man that next to you stands by. Then on his Knees the worthy VVallace fell, O royal King said he pray hear me tell, How Saxon-Seed, hath Scotland sore distrest, Our Elders kill'd and royal Blood opprest, Your Majesty methinks should interpose, In our Behalf, and curb our Lawless Foes. And that by Vertue of the League and Band, 'Twixt FRANCE and SCOTLAND does so firmly stand. Next, since at your Command come here I have, One Favour Sir, I humbly of you crave. The King reply'd I'll grant, or pay you down, What e'er you ask, except my Queen or Crown. Most Royal Sir, said Wallace, all I want Is, that you'll graciously be pleas'd to grant, Peace to this Man, whom I brought here thro' Chance, And I'll disclaim all other Gifts in France. This same is he, you may believe it well, Of whom you speak, Thomas of Longoveil. Receive him as a free Leige of your Land, At which the King was put unto a Stand; Yet for his Promise, and good Wallace Sake. Into his Peace he Longoveil did take. The King he ask'd at Wallace, how and where, He met with Longoveil, who did declare, And there rehearse the Manner how, all o'er, As you have heard the Story told before. Wallace to Thomas also purchas'd then, Peace unto all his Fourteen Hundred Men. Then on the very Spot where he did stand, Was knighted by the King's own royal Hand. Syne to his nearest Heir left his Estate, Then with brave Wallace went and took his Fate. CHAP. III. How WALLACE past into Guienne. Three Weeks at Paris, Wallace did remain, But longed much, to try the Wars again; To march for Guyen, he esteem'd it best, Because that Country English Men possest. Then of the King took Leave, on's Knees did fall. But took no French Men with him then at all. Except Sir Thomas, and a warlike Crew Of Valiant Scots, Nine Hundred stout and true; VVho furiously with him to Guyen ride, And Fire raise, thro' all that Country wide. Forts and strong Castles, quickly they break down, And put to Death many a Suthron Lown. A warlike Town Scemen stood in that Land, VVhich English Men, had under their Command. The Town it stood upon a VVater-Side, VVithin a Park, that was both long and wide. Toward that Place, most valiantly then, VVallace he march'd, with his Nine Hundred Men. Four Hundred to himself took speedily. The rest with Crawford caus'd in Ambush ly. VVallace his Men, all gallantly array'd, Before the Town their Banner there display'd. The Lyon rampant, all in Gold did flee, VVhich Sight before that Country ne'er did see. The Park they range, great Booty drive away, The War Men issued, to rescue the Prey. But worthy Scots, have many English slain, The rest fled back unto the Town again. Fourty good Scots, pass'd with the Prey along, Then ish'd again a Thousand English strong. Wallace he caus'd his Men let go the Prey, Then soon assembled all, in good Array. A fierce Encounter there, you might have seen, 'Mongst those wight War-Men, in their Armour clean. Vast Numbers lost their Lives on Suthron Side, And yet the Rest most boldly did abide. Some worthy Men there of the Scots they slew, Then William Crawford who the Time well knew, Out of the Park he made his Ambush fare, Into the Field, where they all fighting were, He at his Entry, many an one caus'd dye, Yet English Men were very loath to fly. But bravely fought, altho' they lost much Blood. So few, so long, 'gainst Wallace never stood. Yet at the last, were all oblig'd to fly, Whom Wallace did pursue most furiously. And never knew, till he amids the throng, Was in the Town, his Suthron Foes among. With him was Crawford, Richard, Longoveil, Fifteen in all, and no more I wot well. A cunning Porter, got upon the Wall, Pull'd out the Pin, let the Portculzies fall. Then cruelly the English on them set, But to the Wall the Scots their Backs did get. Cut down the Suthron, all their Force defy'd, Then Richard Wallace, he the Porter spy'd: Knock't out his Brains, with little Noise or Din, Got up the Port, let all the Scotsmen in. Who spared none, that they before them fand, If they a Sword, or Weapon, had in Hand. All other Lives most Christianly did spare, But seiz'd the Goods, and Riches all were there. The Town with French replenish'd quickly; then, Wallace the Field takes briskly with his Men. At which the King delay'd not very long, But rais'd an Army Twenty Thousand Strong. All faithfull Subjects of the Crown of France, Led by his Brother, Duke of Orleance. Thro' Guyen Land a speedy March they make. At Burdeous do Wallace overtake. Some said that Town did mightily incline To fight good Wallace, but soon chang'd their Mind. And sent Express to Piccardy by Post, Telling of Wallace, and the new rais'd Host. Glocester then Captain of Calais, went, And told all to the English Parliament. Some plainly said, Wallace had broke the Truce, Others said Nay, that never was his use. Lord Bewmont said, with Judgement most Profound, VVallace for Scotland, not for France was Bound. Yet Woodstock, from his Malice could not cease, But still affirm'd, Wallace had broke the Peace. And told the King, if he'd his Council take, Now was the Time, on Scotland War to make. What Woodstock said, all did conclude it right, By Sea and Land, a Force they raise on Sight. Glocester, he leads on the Army's Van, Longcastle, does the middleward Command; Then Sir John Psewart to the Sea was sent, Who all the North-land perfectly well kent. Vallange the Knight, before the Army went Who all the Mischief did he could invent, And made some Scots with his enticing Word, Yield up their Castles, without stroke of Sword, E'er the best Sort, knew it was War in plain. In Bothwel Castle, he was set again. And Sir John Peswart, who came by the Sea, Soon got St. Johnstoun, by a Jeopardie, Dundee they took, left not a Man on Life, Then plundered; and soon possessed Fife. And all the South, from Cheviot, to the Sea, O barbarous, and cruel Enemy! To Rauchry fled good Adam Wallace then, And Robert Boyd to Bute, Two gallant Men. Sir John the Graham, in Dundaff durst not bide; But marched to the Forrest fair of Clyde. Lundie from Fife he stole away by Night, Eighteen with him that cliver were and tight. And his young Son, then but of tender Age, To Dundaff Moor, they all away do page. Thinking to meet with good Sir John the Graham, Who often made the Suthron fly with Shame. Thomas of Thorn, took Lanerk the next Day, Lundie and Hay, no longer there durst stay. But to South-Tinto, quickly did repair, And good Sir John, did gladly meet them there. Vallange had order'd great Provisions then, Under a Guard of Fourscore English Men. For Bothwel Castle, but unto their Shame, Were soon surpriz'd, by Lundie and by Graham. Who with some hardy Scots, Fifty I trow, Of Fourscore Suthron, Sixty there they slew. Got Gold, and Goods, and all remain'd alive, On the Scot's Side, excepting only Five Then marched all away upon a Night, Unto the Lennox, in their Armour bright. Seatoun and Lyle they lodged in the Bass, But Hugh the Hay, sent unto England was, Then the North Country Lords do in the End, The Squire Guthrie unto Wallace send. At Aberbrothock Shipping took for Sea, And safely at the Sluce soon landed he. To Wallace went, and told in sorry Mood, How sadly Matters now in Scotland stood. Then Wallace said, O Suthron, all Mansworn, For Perfidy, such Rogues were never born. Their former Treachery, did we not feel, Ev'n when the Truce was sign'd with their great Seal. Who notwithstanding, most unchristianly, Caus'd Eighteen Score of our brave Barrons dye. To the great GOD, my Vow I here do make, Peace with that King, hereafter nee'r to take. He shall repent, that he this War began, If it please GOD I be a living Man. Then does Address the King for Liberty To go for Scotland with his Company. With much adoe the King did condescend, With that Proviso when the War did end, And he triumph'd had oe'r his Suthron Foes, He should return to France, and no Time lose. Which if he did, he freely might command, At his Return, a Lordship of good Land. Wallace takes leave, goes streight for Flanders then, With good Sir Thomas, and his Country-Men. The Squire Guthrie's Barge at Sluce lay still, To Sea they went in Haste, with a good will. Fair Wind, and Weather, nothing worse they fand, Then at Montross, they safely all do land. Good Sir John Ramsay, and the Ruthven true, Barclay and Bisset, with Men not a few: Do Wallace meet, all Canty, Keen, and Crouss, And with Three Hundred, march to Ochter House. The End of the Ninth Book. The Tenth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. How WALLACE won St. Johnstoun Unto St. Johnstoun Wallace quickly prest, Which by the English, then was repossest. Under Kinnoul e'er it was Day, lay down, Then spy'd Six Suthron Servants from the Town, Driving Three empty Carts upon the Way, In order to bring Home their Masters Hay. Which, when they were a loadning, suddenly, Guthrie and's Men, made all the Six to dy. Wallace in haste caus'd take their upmost Weed, And Men to fit them, ordered with speed. Wallace himself, and Ruthven brave also, Guthrie, and Bisset, and good Yeomen Two: Each took a Suit and then with Subtile Art, Five Men with Hay they cov'red in each Cart. Then to the Town, those Carters took their Way, And carefully, drove on their Carts of Hay. Good Sir John Ramsay, lay in Ambush till, He warning got, then marched with good will. Over the Bridge, the Carters quickly past, Enter'd the Gate, and then their Cloaks do cast, Wallace with Three good Strokes, which there he got, The Porter kill'd and Two more on the Spot. Guthrie and Bisset, Ruthven of Renown, Most manfully did cut the Suthron down. The armed Men that snug lay in the Carts, Came fiercely out and bravely play'd their parts. VVhen Ramsay's Spy saw all that there was done The Ambush broke, both Bridge and Port have won E'er Ramsay came, with his Men good and true, The Twenty one, there Fourty Suthron slew. And so soon as the Ambush enter'd in, They spared none that were of Suthron Kin. There Longoveil that brave and warlike Knight, Nobly behav'd, and did their Doublets dight The Suthron, when they saw the Town was tint, Fled then as fast, as Fire does from the Flint. And Sir John Psewart at the next Gate past, To Methven-Wood, he scour'd off wonder fast. One hundred Men fled to the Church in vain, But Wallace spared none, for all were slain. Four Hundred Suthron kill'd were in the Strife, And Seven Score only 'scaped with their Life. Wallace got Riches, good things not a few, And with true Scots, plenish'd the Town of new, First to the Gask did Sir John Psewart pass, Then unto Fise, where Vallange Sherriff was. Gath'red of Men a Num'rous Company, To Auchterarder, then drew privily, And to be ready ordered them all, For to attack St. Johnstoun at a Call, Wallace made Ramsay his great Captain there, And Ruthven Sheriff a deserving Pair. He charged them that on first warning they, Should come to him, without further Delay On some Exploit, he quickly marched then, With him One Hundred of good fighting Men. CHAP. II. The Battle of Black-Iron-Side, and how WALLACE took in Lochleven and Airth. To Fise he march'd that Country's State to view, With his good Men that trusty were and true. But Sir John Psewart from the Ochel high Espying Wallace as he passed by: All on a sudden 'gainst him marched then, To Black-Iron-Side with Fifteen Hundred Men. This sudden March good Wallace so alarms, He and his Men stand quickly to their Arms. With Bisset and good Guthrie does advise, What Course to take against this sad Surprize. We with the Suthron, now are so beset, To our good Friends at Perth no Word we'll get. It grievs me more that Vallange is the Guide, Than all the rest upon the Suthron Side. Guthrie reply'd, could we get over Tay, It were I think the sure and safest Way. And warn good Ramsay, who commands the Town, He'd send a Reinforcement to us soon. It's safer Wallace says in my Esteem, To fight the Foe, than dangerously to swim. In Elchock Park but Fourty Men were we, Against Seven Hundred, and made Suthron flee, So may we now thro' help of divine Grace, Take Courage Lads, and bravely show your Face. This Wood we'll hold as long as we can stand, To the last Man we'll fight it Sword in Hand. The Right is ours let's to it manfully, I'll free this Land once more before I die. Which Speech did so their Hearts to him engage, And put their Spirits upon such an Edge That some call out to take the Field in plain, Wallace said no, those Words are all in Vain. My Thoughts, and Sentiments are no way such, This VVood may prove to our Advantage much. For tho' our Courage be not wanting now, Yet pray believe good Conduct's needful too: Then hewen Wood and Planks of Oak did take, A strong Barrier then quickly did he make. And by the Time that all was finish'd Right. The English Army came within their Sight. Psewart attacks the Wood with a Bravade, But finds a Strong and Dev'lish Barricade There with a Thousand Men does wait and watch, And with Five Hundred Vallarge does detach, To guard the Wood, that not one single Skin, Might 'scape the Sword of all that were within. Fourty good Archers VVallace had that Tide, Which gall'd the English Horse on every Side. The Rest were Spear-Men long in War expert, Honour was all the Thing they had at Heart. As evidently over all was seen By their Defence at the Encounter keen. A Void was left, where Suthron enter might, Fourty at first were put to death on Sight. Numbers of Horse were killed with the Shot, The wounded reel'd, and to a Plain they got. Psewart rampag'd to see both Man and Horse, So sore rebuted, and put to the worse. Vallange advis'd he would forbear to fight And rest his Men, closs by the Wood that Night For Hunger soon would drive them from their Strength, Then might he charge them in the Field at length Psewart reply'd 'tis dangerous to delay, If Succour come to them what will you say. Along with me Eight Hundred Men shall fare All in a Range, to round the Wood with care. The Rest they shall with thee continue still, To fight or be commanded at thy will Be brisk said Vallange, quickly him beset, For now I think he's fairly in the Net. Could you but slay, or take him upon Life, King Edward sure, would make you Lord of Fise. When Wallace he their Disposition saw, And Psewart charge with so much Rage and Aw: Brave Lads he said yon Psewart is a Knight, Foreward in Wars, both Hardy, Wise, and Wight. Such an Attack against us and a Sore He does intend, as you ne'er saw before Since we're beset with Foes on ev'ry Side, And must perforce here in this Forrest bide. Take Notice all, and mark well what I say, His first Assault boldly resist I Pray Crawford he left, and Longoviel the Knight, At the Barrier to keep it safe and tight. Wallace himself, briskly encounters then, Psewart, with Sixty, 'gainst Eight Hundred Men. Who fought so fierce and show'd their Valour so, No English Man durst from his Fellow go, To break his Rank or foremost enter in, So Bloodily the Dispute did begin. On either Side, the Spears in Flinders flew, Numbers of English there the Scotsmen slew. Vallange at this Time sorely did assail, Crawford, and the brave Knight good Longoviel. Who boldly stood and did defend their Ground, And at the Entry hew'd the Suthron down. Thus were the Scots attack'd on ev'ry Hand, Fifteen to one, too Numerous a Band Nothing they had now for't, but do, or dye, Psewart surpris'd was with such Bravery. VVho pressing on, with a good Sword of Steel Kill'd a stout Scot who had behaved well. Wallace inrag'd, did quickly vow Revenge, And a sound Blow with Psewart to exchange, But Troops of Suthron interveening soon, He miss'd his Mark, tho' others he cut down. Great slops the Scots made 'mong the Suthron Ranks, From Front to Rear, and out thro' both their Flanks, Eighty that Time were slain without Remead, And at the Barrier Fifty killed dead. After this brisk Repulse and fair Defeat, Psewart he quickly caused sound Retreat, And then consults, what's proper next to do, Curses hard Fate, 'cause beat by such a few. The worthy Scots go in to the Barrier, Wash all their Wounds, refresh, and make good Chear. At many Bouts said Wallace, I have been, But such a fierce Attack have scarcely seen. Then from a Strand of Water running by, He all his Men supply'd abundantly. Drank first himself, then said in sober Mood The Wine in France I ne'er thought half so good. Sir John concludes in Council to be brief, To fight no more till he get fresh Relief. And then to starve with Hunger in the Field, The Scots, if they stood out and did not yeild. Mean Time he charg'd John Vallange to abide, And keep them into Couper till he'd ride. VVho said such Charge he would not undertake. To fight all Day, and then all Night to wake. Psewart cry'd stay, or under-ly the Blame, I thee Command in good King Edward's Name, Or here to God I Vow without all scorn, If they break out, to hang thee up the Morn. Wallace was blyth when that he heard such Strife Nothing e'er pleas'd him better all his Life. And then drew near at a fit Time withall, To the VVood side, and did on Vallange call. Yon Knight I think would make a Coward start, Come in to us, his Brag's not worth a F?t. And thou shalt have a Lordship in thy Hand Thy Brother left behind him in this Land. Vallange choos'd rather with the Scots to bide, Than venture's Life upon the English Side. So in a Moment, all with one Consent, He, and his Men, straight into Wallace went. Then Psewart said I ne'er expected such Base Treatment, but John Vallange mock'd him much. By this brave Ramsay, and good Ruthven then, To Black Iron Side came with Three Hundred Men. Psewart the Knight, well hath their coming seen, Who choos'd a Plain, and drew up on the Green Twelve Hundred Men he had wanting a Score, The Scots Five Hundred Sixty, and no more. Now to the Wood good Wallace bids Adieu, Who all this Time nothing of Ramsay knew. But when he heard him Shout, and Ruthven Cry, How did his Heart rejoice exceedingly. On either Side quickly assembled they, And set the Battle all in good Array. The English who, were more in Nmmber far, By Psewart now in Two divided are, The worthy Scots, so soon as they were drest, Most furiously among them quickly prest. And as they in the Wood behaved well, So on the Plain, they fought as stout as Steel. Had small Respite from rising of the Sun. Yet charg'd as fresh, as if but new begun. Ramsay and Ruthven, came with fresh Relief, Unto the Suthron's Sorrow and great Grief. And of their Carcases took a sound Mends, Dissever'd them in Twentys, and in Tens When Spears were gone with Swords of Mettal clear. They pav'd their Way, in hast from Front to Rear. Wallace, and his good Men, by Strength of Hand, Made Suthron Blood to Stream out thro' the Land. Three Hundred English briskly in the End, Surround Sir John, and bravely him defend. The Scots who saw so many in a Rout, With Psewart stand, and guarding him about, Upon their Flanks did them attack full sore, And with their Points the polish'd Plates did bore. Ramsay inclin'd that Psewart he should Yield, Rather than see him dy upon the Field. No, he shall dy said Wallace, by God's Grace, He came to pay his Ransom in this Place. The Suthron plainly saw that they must dy Succour was none, suppose that they should fly. Freshly they fought, as they had enter'd new, And some good Men on the Scots Side they slew. To please our King [said Psewart] and his Laws, We lose our Lives, in an unrighteous Cause. With that he strook brave Bisset to the Death; For which good Wallace, quickly stop't his Breath. Who with on Stroke, cut him down with his Sword, And after that he never spoke a Word. But to the Ground rush'd down with all his Might By Wallace Hand, thus dy'd that Gallant Knight, The Rest were kill'd, what could the Scots do more, Then all lament the loss of Bisset sore. Ruthven for Perth, to march he ready makes, And Sir John Ramsay Couper Castle takes. Wallace, and Crawford, Guthrie, Longoveil, With Richard, takes Lundores that Night to beil. Vallange was Stewart, who abundantly With Meat and Drink did bravely them supply, The English all flee fast before them now, As does the Bishop of St. Andrews too. Who would not Wallace coming there abide, Was so dirt fear'd, even for all Scotland wide, Their worthy Knight that into Couper lay, Seiz'd all their Riches on the second Day. And at Command of Wallace, did cast down, And raze that Place unto the very Ground. Then to Carrail did suddenly repair, Where he found nought, but Walls and Buildings bare. The English then troop'd off all in a String, And thro' all Fife the Scots did rant and Reign. No English Man was left, for all did fly, Save in Lochlev'n, one single Company. A Knight Musgrove, that did command Kinghorn, The Meerest Coward that was ever born: Hearing that Wallace would attack the Place, Fled and deserted to his great Disgrace, Wallace possest the House and on the Morn To Scotland's Well does with his Men return. When Night was come they sup'd and went to Rest, But still Lochleven stuck in Wallace Breast. To which he pass'd near middle of the Night, With Eighteen chosen Men, all stout and tight. Courage brave Boys he said, and never flinch, The Suthron now ly sleeping in yon Inch. Since Honour's to be won, let's venture for't, If we get o'er, we shall have pleasant Sport, Do you remain all here upon the Spot, I'll try if I can bring you o'er their Boat. Quickly he stript with his brave Sword and good. Bound round his Neck, and leap'd into the Flood Over he swims, and very quickly then, Seizes the Boat, and brought her to his Men. Who when array'd, no longer did abide, But jumped in, and row'd to th'other Side. The Inch they took, boldly with Sword in Hand, And spared none before him that they fand. To Wives, and Bairns, he Mercy still did shew, But Thirty Men upon the Place he slew. To call good Ramsay he hath Orders giv'n, To dine with him if he pleas'd at Lochleven; Sent out a Man the Suthron Horse to keep, Drew up the Boat then went to bed to sleep. The Messenger, good Ramsay did surprize, Who with unusual briskness bad him rise. My Lord good Sir does kindly you Invite, Unto Lochleven, to eat a dish of Meat. Ramsay got up, and march'd with all his Men, And there carous'd full eight Days to an end. Turs'd off the Goods that Suthron had brought there, Caus'd burn the Boat, then unto Perth repair. There Bishop Sinclair met them in a Trice, And wisely gave to Wallace his Advice. Jop to the North for more Supplie was sent, For none alive the Country better kent. Good Mr. Blair in Sacerdotal Weed Went to the West, to warn his Friends with Speed: How unto Wallace they might safely get, The Suthron had their Passage so beset. Brave Adam Wallace, and good Lindsay fare, To Earl Malcolm, where they welcome were. There was the noble Graham, and Lundie brave And Boyd, like Men are new rais'd from their Grave. Jop marched on, Cummine Lord Buchan was, For old Envy he suffered none to pass. Yet poor Men came to Wallace as they might, For to defend old Ancient Scotland's Right. The Randal young to serve his Country bent Good Men from Murray hath to Wallace sent Jop did return unto his Master soon, And told him all, tho' little he got done. But Mr. Blair such noble Tydings brought, That of the Cummine Wallace reckon'd nought VVallace, who did the fit Occasion ken March'd streight from Perth and with him Fifty Men. Good Irish Steven, and Keirly that was wight, In Watchmens Garb to Wallace march'd on Sight. Upon more Force to wait he had no Mind And left the Rest to keep the Land behind. By Stirling Bridge to march he did not please, For English Men bum there as thick as Bees. But over Airth they ferry'd hastily, And lurked in a private Place hard by. A Cruel Captain dwelt in Airth that Year, An English Man whose Name was Thomlin Weir One Hundred Men were at his Lodging still, Possest that Land according to their will. A Scottish Fisher seiz'd, who out of fear, Unto their Service made the Fellow swear. Jop early went the Passage for to spy, And on the Fisher happened suddenly. Then asked him, what Country Man art thou, A Scot he said, but Suthron made me vow. Unto their Service sore against my Mind, Pox on the Pack, I love none of their Kind. A fishing I came o'er to this North Side, A Scotsman if you be, I'll with you bide. When Jop to Wallace told the poor Man's Case They all rejoyced to see the Fishers Face. Since with his Boat they might good Passage have, Not valuing what the poor Man should crave. To the Southland most gladly they did fare, Then broke the Boat when they were landed there. Out thro' the Moss they marched with good speed, To the Tor-Wood the Fisher did them lead. A Widow there brought Tydings in short space, Of Wallace Friend that Dwelt at Dunipace Thomlin of Weir had him in Prison put, Which Wallace, vex'd, and to the Heart him cut. Dame, said good Wallace he shall loosed be, The Morn by Noon and set at Liberty. They Ate and Drank, in Quiet there abode, And on the Morrow early took the Road. Toward Airth-Hill his Force with him he drew, Where was a Strength that well the Fisher knew. A private Way the Fisher him directs, Then to the Suthron pay'd his best Respects. O'er a small Bridge into the Hall he got, And them Salutes in Rage and Fury hot. With shearing Swords clinking out o'er their Crowns, There without Mercy hew'd the Suthron down. Thomlin of Weir he thro' the Body clave, And his good Men did soon dispatch the lave, Thro' all the Room the Blood gush'd boiling hot One Hundred Men lay dead upon the Spot. Then to relieve his Uncle went along, In a deep Cave who lay in Fetters strong. Before that Time his Uncle ne'er had been. So glad as when good Wallace he has seen. Into deep Ditches the dead Corps were cast, And carefully their Watches plac'd at last. Upon the Morrow gathered up the Spoil, Both Gold, and Jewels, to reward their Toil. Suthron came in, but quickly changed Hues, For none went back to tell their Neighbours News Steven of Ireland, Keirly that was wight, These Two did keep the Port the Second Night. E'er it was Day the worthy Scots arose, Turs'd off their Spoil, and to the Tor-Wood goes. Now since at Airth the Scots has done their best, Let's see what came of them went to the West. CHAP. III. How WALLACE burnt the English in Dumbarton. Wallace and his Good Men, march'd all the Night, And to Dumbarton came e'er it was light. Then at a Widow's House did quickly call, And whisper'd softly to her thro' the Wall. Whose Voice so soon as the good Woman knew, Unto her Cloaths immediately she drew. In a closs Barn, him and his Men she got, Good Meat and Drink in truth he wanted not. Then unto Wallace gave one Hundred Pound, To make his Supper go the better down. Nine Sons she had, good likely Men and tight. An Oath to him she made them swear on Sight. There he remain'd secure, and never budg'd, But caused Mark the Doors where Southron lodg'd Then all march'd on, and Silence closely kept Unto the Gate where they securely slept An English Captain, and Nine of his Mates Drinking too late, did brag of mighty Fates. Had I good Wallace, one said in a Rage, I would think nothing with him to engage. Another there, his Head and Neck would pawn, He'd tye Sir John the Graham with strength of Hand. A Third he'd fight the Boyd with a good Sword 'Twould set him better far to fight a T?d. Another wish'd for Lundie, by his Life, And some for Seaton, in that drunken Strife, When Wallace heard the Southron make such Din He boldly all alone himself went in. Then with a brave bold Countenance and Stout, Saluted them most handsomly about. I'm from my Travels come, Gentles said he, Longing your Conquest of the Scots to see. Some of your Drink and other Cheer I'd have The Captain then a Saucy Answer gave. Thou seem'st a Scot, likely to be a Spy, And may'st be one of Wallace Company, Which if thou be, nothing shall thee protect, From being hang'd up quickly by the Neck. Wallace thought then, it was not Time to stand, His noble Sword fast gripped in his Hand. With such a Stroke the Captain did surprise, As cut off all that stood above the Eyes. Another there he killed in great Ire, A third he threw unto the burning Fire Keirly and Steven came in with Courage true; And kill'd the Rest of all the drunken Crew. The Hostler then without further Delay, Directed Wallace where the Suthron lay. Who set their Lodgings all in a fair Low, About their Ears, and burnt them Stab and Stow. Then to Dumbartan Cave with merry speed. March'd long e'er Day, a quick Exploit indeed, Towards Rosneath, next Night they past along, Where Englishmen possest that Castle strong. Who that same Day unto a Wedding go, Fourscore in Number at the least or moe. In their return the Scots upon them set Where Fourty did their Death Wounds fairly get The Rest scour'd off, and to the Castle fled, But Wallace who in War was nicely bred. He did the Entry to the Castle win, End slew the Suthron all were found therein. After the Flyers did pursue with Speed. None did escape him, all were cut down dead. On their Purveyance seven Days lodged there, At their own Ease, and merrily did fare. Some Suthron came to visit their good Kin, But none went out be sure, that once came in. After he had set Fire to the Place, March'd straight to Faukland in a litle Space. There Earl Malcolm was of glorious Fame, Richard of Lundie, and Sir John the Graham: Good Adam Wallace, that true hearted Scot, Barclay and Boyd, and others of great Note. With them he keep'd his Yool and Holy Days, Who past their Time in Feasting Sport and Plays. Till Tydings came of his dear Mother's Death, Who to Almighty had resign'd her Breath. Then did he order Jop, and Mr. Blair, To bury her and no Expence to spare. Who posted off with speed, did not deferr, And honourably did her Corps interr. His Mourning Wallace soon threw off, for he, Had most at Heart how Scotland he might free. CHAP. IV. How Sir William Douglas won the Castle of Sanquhair by a Jeopardy: How WALLACE rescu'd him from the English and put them out of those Parts. Sir William Douglas as old Writers record, Of Douglas-dale at this Time was the Lord. By his deceased Lady he had now Two likely Sons, for Strength and Courage too. Whose nat'ral Parts, all Greatness did presage, When at the Schools, and but of tender Age. In Knowledge that they might the more advance, They're quickly sent to the best Schools in France. Their Father that most noble valiant Knight, King Edward had detain'd against all Right: Till with the Lady Ferres he'd conclude, A Match, which after prov'd not for his good. Two Sons he had by this young Lady fair, And then got leave for Scotland to repair. Accordingly, his Lady, Sons, and he, Came all to Douglass and lived Pleasantlie King Edward thought that he had stedfast been To him, but Faith the Contrair soon was seen, The old Scots Blood remained in him still, Which to the English never bore good will. That Time the Sanquhair was a Castle strong From which the Scots did suffer frequent wrong. An English Captain did Command the same. Was Bewford call'd, a Pox upon his Name. To Douglas Lady was a Kinsman near From him no Harm on that account did fear But when Sir William saw Wallace in plain, Was likely to free Scotland once again; He as a true Born Scots-Man, thought he should Give all Assistance to him that he could. To which a chearfull Heart he ready found, Being by Force to Edward only bound. To Thomas Dickson a young Man and bold, His Inclinations then he quickly told: How he design'd with all his Pow'r and Might To frighten, and surprise the English Knight I have said Dickson, a good Friend indeed, John Anderson, who Fire-Wood does lead Unto the Castle, stout and true like Steel, To him I'll go and all the Case reveal. Into a Moment good Sir William then, Prepared Thirty stout well chosen Men He told his Lady, to Dumfries he went, To meet some English that had to him sent. Then march'd till Night upon them fast did draw, And in a Cleugh lurk'd by the Water Craw, Dickson to Sanquhair goes and tarries not, And with John Anderson makes up a Plot. That he should take John's Horses and his Weed, By it was Day, a Draught of Wood to lead. John was a cliver and auldfarrand Boy, As you shall hear by the ensuing Ploy. Mean Time good Anderson unto him told, Ingenously the whole Strength of the Hold. Fourty they are, all Men of great avail, Be they on Foot, they'll sorely you Assaill, But if you chance the Entry for to get, A great Pole-Ax on your right Hand is set: Which may defend you stoutly in the Throng Be Douglas wise he'l not stay from you long: Then Anderson the Ambush by and by, Near to the Castle led most privately. Dickson is with the draught of green Wood gone, Who to the Castle whisling came anon. Array'd in Anderson's old rural Weed, To whom the Porter opened with Speed. Who said, this Hour thou might have stay'd away, Thou art untimeous, for its scarcely Day. Dickson his Draught got in by lucky Fate, Then cut the Cords, and all sell in the Gate. The Porter twice out o'er the Head he Struck, And kill'd him dead, prodigious good Luck. The Ax he got, whereof his good, Friend spoke, And gave a Sign whereat the Ambush broke Douglas was foremost, Faith he made no stand But o'er the Wood march'd straight with Sword in Hand Three Watch-Men kill'd within the Closs that Hour, And won the Gate that leads to the great Tow'r. Run up the Stair, where the good Captain lay, Who trembling stood and fain would been away. Too late he was, Douglas struck up the Door And stick'd him dead where he stood on the Floor. Then took the House put Suthron all to death, None did escape save one with Life or Breath. The Fellow fled in hast to Durisdear, And told the Captain all, in pannick fear. Who to the Enoch caus'd another go, And warn Lochmabane, Tibbersmoor also. The Country also brag'd no less to do Then Siege the Castle and hang Douglas too. Sir William then most prudently on Sight, Dickson dispatch'd, to warn the Wallace wight. Who in the Lennox very boldly then, Did ly encamped with Four Hundred Men. On which he marches, makes no longer stay, Unto the Castle of Kilsyth that Day, Where Ravindale Numbers of Suthron had, But was himself that Time at Cambernad. The Earl Malcolm posted was hard by. In Ambush with Two Hundred Men to ly. To guard the House, the Rest himself he took, Into the VVood, and made one sharply look About, and spy when Ravindail he came, For they design'd him and his Men some Game. VVho when betwixt the Bushments Two he got He and his Men were all kill'd on the spot. To siege the Castle, would no longer stay, But march'd and burnt Linlithgow in his VVay, VVhere Suthron dwelt; and on the Morrow sent, And burnt Dalkeith, then to Newbottle went. Lauder by this, and Seaton of Renown, Came from the Bass, and burn'd North-Berwick Town And with an Hundred Men in Armour bright Do Wallace meet, which was a joyfull Sight. Dickson he also met with Wallace now, Who promis'd soon the Douglas to rescue Brave Hugh the Hay in noble order then, To Peebles came with Fifty valiant Men. And Rutherford that ever true had been. With Sixty Men, Cruel in War and keen. Couragiously all marched then along, And numbered were, good Men Six Hundred strong: By this the Suthron Sanquhair does beset, Thinking they had brave Douglas in the Net. But News of Wallace came with such a Thud As quickly put a Fear unto their Fud. For Wallace scarce to Crawford Moor had got, When Shame a Tail remain'd upon the Spot. The Siege thus rais'd in Hurry and great Fray, The bumbaz'd Suthron scamp'red all away Which News when Wallace heard, he that same Night, Three Hundred Horse-Men chose, in Harness light, The Earl Malcolm quickly order'd he, To follow on, a good Rereguard to be. Thro' Durisdear pursues this Chiftain bold, The plainest Way, 'bove Mortoun then does hold. At Closburn when the Suthron came in sight, He charg'd and kill'd Sevenscore into the Fight. When Suthron saw the Case had happened so, To rally then they make a Faint Sham-show. With Wallace to debate in open Fields But Earl Malcom closs was at their Heels. At which they thought it was not Time to stay, But each Man fled and made the best o's Way. Wallace, and the good Earl do pursue, And in the Flight demolish'd not a few. Five Hundred good, they and their Men have cast Dead to the Ground e'er they Dalswinton past. The wearied Horses, march no further can, Tho' all the Men were fresh as they began. Wallace, and Graham, must then dismount perforce And take their Foot, good Fate it was no worse: So fierce they follow without Fear or Dread, None but the Horse could equal them in Speed. Their Strokes so heavy dreadfull were and sore, Whom e'er they hit did grieve the Scots no more. Then a new Party Men of Note and Fame, With good fresh Horses unto Wallace came. Good Currie and the Johnstoun stout and gay, Kirkpatrick, and the trusty Halliday. Sevenscore new Men came up, a brave Recruit. Who noble Service did in the pursuit. Good Currie there, brave Wallace hors'd again, Who quickly hath three English Captains slain: Of Durisdear, Enoch; and Tibbers-Moor, The Dint of his good Sword none could endure. The Maxwel als, out of Carlav'rock drew, And did the Suthron furiously pursue. Beside Cock-pool sound Payment there they got, Some drowned were, and some kill'd on the Spot. Wallace return'd, and in Carlaverock bode, And to Dumfries upon the Morrow rode; Proclaim'd his Peace to all within those Bounds, That would assist against the Suthron Lowns No longer there at that Time did abide, For Suthron fled from Scotland on each Side, The Towns and Castles Scotsmen then possest, And rul'd the Land, and then the Land had Rest. Brave Douglass had behav'd so nobly there, VVas Keeper made from Drumlanrig to Air. Mean Time his Lady Counterfeis her Spite, And like a Serpent waits her Time to bite, By this the English Captains all did flee, Excepting Morton, that held out Dundee. Which Wallace vex'd and greatly disoblig'd, VVherefore he march'd, and closely him besieg'd. Morton does beg his Life, and then he'd go, For England straight, but Wallace answer'd no. All England shall Example of thee take, Thou shalt be hanged for King Edward's Sake. VVhen Wallace had confirm'd the Siege then he Qhe Scrimzeor made Constable of Dundee. One Ballinger of England, that was there, Past out of Tay, and came to Quithy fair. To London wrote, and told of Wallace Vow. And in what Pickle Morton labour'd now VVhich Tydings put King Edward to a Stance, And call'd him home, who fighting was in France. Then did he charge, and summon Bruce by Name, To answer or to under-ly the Blame. And all the rest, who liv'd under his Crown, Bishop and Barron, got a Summonds soon I leave him here to his new Hellish Plots, From which good GOD preserve the Sakeless Scots. The English, that Time Guyen Land possest, And did that Country very much infest. On which Account a Herauld does advance Express to Wallace from the King of France. Praying he'd come and charge the Suthron Lowns, And once more chase them, from his Gallick Bounds. This Message from the King received he, VVhen busy at the Siege, before Dundee. The Herauld there he entertain'd at Large, Most splendidly, on his own proper Charge. And told him all the great Fates he had done, But that he could not give an Answer soon. Untill he saw what Edward did contrive, And Plot against the Scots, ill may he thrive. The VVits of France have with the Herauld sent, A brave Description and a fine Comment, On VVallace Actions, and his Person rare, To either which, the Age could not compare. In Stature he was full Nine Quarters high, When measured at least without a Ly. Betwixt his Soulders, was three Quarters broad, Such Length, and Breadth, wou'd now a-days seem odd. Was no Fatigue but what he could endure. Great, but well shaped Limbs, Voice strong and sture, Burning brown Hair, his Brows and Eye Bries light. Quick piercing Eyes, like to the Diamonds bright, All well proportion'd, Visage long and sound, Nose square and neat, with ruddy Lips and round; His Breast was high, his Neck was thick and strong. A Swinging Hand, with Arms both large and long. Grave in his Speech, his Colour Sanguine fine, A Beauteous Face wherein did Honour shine. In Time of Peace, Mild as a Lamb would be, When War approach'd a Hector stout was he. Riches he mock'd, submited all to Fate; Gave what he wan, like Alexander great; To Scotsmen he great Trust and Credit gave, But a known Foe could never him deceive, Such qualities Men did to him advance, Who were the very greatest Wits in France. Which Mr. Blair mark'd all in Wallace Book, On which you're kindly welcome now to look, But at the Siege as Wallace earnest lay, Jop brought him Tydings on a certain Day: How Edward came with a great Force along An Army of an Hundred Thousand Strong Wallace commands Scrimzeor quickly then, There to command Eight Thousand of his Men. And close besiege the Suthron in that Place, That none might thence escape in any Case. Wallace himself did with Two Thousand ride To Perth, where he some few Days did abide. Toward the South his March did then begin, With his brave Lads, all in a merry Pin. King Edward does to young Lord Woodstock send And orders him to March Ten Thousand Men To Stirling Bridge, and there to keep the Pass, Who, when he came behaved like an Ass. Without Respect to Orders, cross'd the Forth, And with his Men march'd straight unto the North. But for his Folly very soundly pay'd, Who had his King's Command thus disobey'd The End of the Tenth Book. The Eleventh BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. The Battle of Falkirk. Young Woodstock now, all in his Airs is got, He'll Wallace fight, rescue Dundee, what not? But was surpriz'd, when looking round about, He Wallace saw, with him Eight Thousand stout Old bardy Boys, which made him change his Hue, And on a sudden look both Pale and Blue. But finding them in Number less than he, Resolves to fight, and not a Foot to flee. On Sherriff-Moor Wallace drew up his Men, Who had Eight Thousand 'gainst Lord Wood-Stock's Ten There furiously the Armies do engage Each other, in a Desp'rate Bloody Rage. The hardy Scots together stuck so true, In Rank and File Seven Thousand Suthron slew. Three Thousand more who fought and would not yeild, VVere quickly all cut down upon the Field. Lord Woodstock dead among them also lay, Not one escap'd the Sword that fatal Day; Silver and Gold, Horses and other Spoil, Scotsmen got to remunerat their Toil. VVithout a Halt to Stirling Bridge they ride, And all pass over to the other Side. Then Carpenters and Crafts men quickly call. VVho presently undo the Passage all. To the Dridfoord Wallace he sent them syne VVho ordered all according to his Mind. Then made he Lauder very quickly pass, Along the Coast where any Vessel was And Men with him who searched every Nook, And from each Boat a Board or Two they took, In Stirling then lay with his Foot and Horse, VVatching what VVay the English bent their Force. The Earl Malcolm came to VVallace then, With the brave Lennox Lads true hearted Men. Sir John the Graham came also speedily, Attended with a Glorious Company. Who Tydings brought King Edward was at Hand. Ev'n at Torphichen with his Suthron Band. Stuart of Bute with a great Number next To Wallace came for Battle bravely fixt. Who on the Morrow with the Cummine arch, Each with Ten Thousand, to Falkirk did march. Ten Thousand also of brave valiant Men, Wallace drew quickly up in Order then, There Earl Malcolm was of mighty Fame, And that renowned Knight Sir John the Graham Seaton, and Lauder, Boyd the stout and tight. And Adam Wallace, a most noble Sight. Then by Express came Information sure, The Suthron all were in Slamannan-Moor. Pitching their Tents, setting Pavilions down, Be South Falkirk, litle above the Town. Jop view'd their Number as they went along VVhich was compute one Hundred Thousand Strong. Nevertheless, the Scots do Courage take At Sight of VVallace, and all Fear forsake. The Cummine here, fy on him for a Scot, 'Gainst Wallace does contrive a hellish Plot. Told the Lord Stuart Wallace had no Right To lead the Van, before him in the Fight. Which bred great Heat betwixt the Gallant Two, So subtily Cummine the Coal did blow. The Stuart then does toward Wallace make, Pray Sir, what Course is proper now to take. For Edward comes with a prodigious Power; To fight said Wallace, there's no other Cure. With far more Troops I've seen yon King appear, And soundly beat, with fewer Men than here. Let's to it then for we have Men anew, Likely and good, providing they be true Then Stuart said the Van-Guard he would have; Wallace reply'd, as God my Soul shall save That shall ye not, I'll grant you no such Thing, Nor no Man else, except my righteous King. Twice have I rescu'd this my Native Land, And shall I now resign my old Command. I let you know, its neither Brag nor Boast, Will bully me out of my righteous Post. So much a Fool I am not Sir, by half, At such a Time to quit my Marshalls Staff, To which the Stuart answered again The Owl did of his Feathers once complain, At which Dame Nature took a Feather fair From every Bird, and him delivered there. Which Gift the Owl no sooner did receive, Than he thro' Pride rebuted all the lave. Why then so high Sir? does it not appear, That you condemn all but you self are here Then of your Men be not so Vain, but mind, Had each his own, you should have few behind. Wallace enrag'd, flew in a flame of Fire, And too too rashly call'd the Stuart Liar, No Owl I am, for I have often been, At the Noon Day where thou durst not be seen: Fighting thy Foes, for Glory not for Pelf, This Parable thou speak'st against thy self. It is the Cummine has thee thus advis'd, I know his Speech, tho' masked and disguis'd. From Danger great I did relieve that Slave, And this is all the Thanks I now receive. No Succour then expect from me this Day, Then wheel'd and with Ten Thousand rode away. Great Comfort this did to the English yeild And almost forc'd the Scots to leave the Field. At which the Stuart greiving much he swore, Cummine should rue his base Advice full sore. For that he now did very plainly see, His Plot was only Self and Treachery. The Earl Hartford 'gainst the Stuart then, Advanc'd with Thirty Thousand Englishmen. Whom the brave Stuart charg'd so fierce and hot, That Hartford's Men in Heaps lay on the Spot. When Spears were broke, boldly their Swords they drew And Twenty Thousand of the Suthron slew, The Rest they fled unto their King with Grief, VVho sent Ten Thousand for a fresh Relief. VVhich when the noble Champion Wallace saw, And the brave Scots up in Battalie draw. Held up his Hands, and fervently did say, O GOD Assist yon Lord I humbly Pray; And tho' he be with fresh Force overset. Grant he the Victory o'er his Foes may get, By this the Bruce and Bishop Beik, do then, Fiercely advance with Forty Thousand Men. When Wallace did the Bruce's-Banner know, Good GOD said he how do this World go. To see a Man so forward and so rude, As fight against his Native Flesh and Blood. Were I but free of my rash Oath and Vow, I'd either dy or Stuart brave rescue. Kindness said pray rescue him from the Foe, But Will said Nay, why Fool wilt thou do so? Kindness reply'd they are good Scottish Men, On that said Will I cannot much depend. Had they been good, as one we all had been, The contrair whereof now is plainly seen. Tho' one be false said Kindness that ne'er shall, Make us neglect the Rest and lose them all. Who have behaved so well and Suthron slain, Rescue them now and thereby Honour gain. Then on the Rogue, occasion'd all the Strife, Avenge thy self if he be found on Life, Will said this Day they shall not helped be, What I have said, shall still be said for me. With that the Tears unto their great Surprize, Burst out and trickled down from both his Eyes. Sir John the Graham and many others more, For the brave Stuart weeped wondrous sore. To see him with such Numbers overpowr'd. While Cowardly the Cummine fled and scour'd The Men of Bute before their Lord they stood, Defending him in streams of their own Blood. Till at the last so faint and weary grown, They by the Bruce are all quite overthrown: And brave Lord Stuart scorning for to yeild. With his good Men lay dead upon the Field, Then Wallace turn'd about to his Men true. My Lords said he what's proper now to do. If we turn East for Strength in Louthian Land, They'll us pursue, with all their Numerous Band Take we the Moor King Edward is before; We have but one Thing for't without words more To the Tor-Wood in Order all Compleat, Thro' Bruce's Host we'll fight a brave Retreat, To which they all did chearfully consent. And as one Man were all alike content, Good Wallace then mounting his Horse on Sight March'd at their Head in shining Armour bright. With harnish'd Horse when to the Host he drew, The Cry arose and Spears in pieces flew, So fiercely sought the Scots, that by and by. Eight Thousand Suthron on the Field did ly. E'er Bruce and Beik, their Men got in array, Wallace pass'd thro' and cleanly cut his Way. Then gave Command to march his Host on Sight, To the Tor-Wood with all the speed they might. He and Sir John the Graham and Lauder then, Stay'd with Three Hundred Stout West Country Men. Expert in War would hazard any Thing, Who do attack some of the En'mies Wing. No Spears they had, but Swords of Temper'd Steel. As to their Smart the Englishmen did feel, For e'er the Bruce thereof could Knowledge have, Wallace had sent Three Hundred to their Grave, With Thirty Thousand Men Bruce did pursue His Native Scots, the Suthron to rescue. And order'd Beik for a Relief to be, Which when good Wallace did observe and see, Alas he said how Bruce with all his Might Does ruin, and destroy his own true Right. Wallace Commands his Men to their own Host And stay'd behind for all the Bruce's Boast. Yea on their Front so fiercely in he broke, A Suthron there he slew at every Stroke, But when retiring, woe is me therefore, Under the Haunch the Bruce did Wound him sore. At which the Graham and Lauder so inrag'd, Did cut down all with whom they once engag'd. For they alone bravely maintain'd their Ground, While Wallace was a dressing of his Wound Who with Three Hundred very quickly came, To rescue Lauder and the noble Graham. Then with fresh Force does Bishop Beik appear, Who makes the Scots Seven Aiker broad retire. Yet were the Two delivered there full well, By Wallace Hand, and a good Sword of Steel At this successful, brisk and bold Rescue, The awful Bruce three gallant Scotsmen slew. Then with great Fury with a Spear or Lance, At Wallace struck, but miss'd him by good Chance. To whom a backward Stroke good Wallace gave, Which his Horse Neck and Spear asunder clave. Bruce was at Ground e'er Wallace look'd about, But was re-hors'd by valiant Men and stout And Wallace all alone left in the Stour, Which Graham perceiving 'spite of all their Pow'r; Bravely advanc'd, and struck an English Knight, Before the Bruce, upon the Baisnet Right, So furiously, that, with a single Blow, He cut him down, and then away did go. But Oh my Heart does grieve and bleed to tell, What after this, the noble Graham befell. A subtile English Knight there suddenly, An open 'twixt his Harnish did espy, Thro' which alace, who can forbear to tear? He in his Bowels thrust his bloody Spear, And yet the Graham for all his mortal Wound. Turn'd, kill'd the Knight and rush'd him to the Ground. Then christianly, in Temper calm, and sweet, To the Almighty did resign his Sp'rit. When Wallace saw the gallant Graham was gone How did it rack him to the very Bone. Like one demented, and from Reason rent, Amidst the Suthron Host with Fury went. Enraged at the loss of Graham that Day, He cut down all that came into his Way. When Bruce perceived Wallace in such Rage, He order'd Spearmen with him to engage. To kill his Horse that he might not escape, They thought him all a Devil in Mans shape. Then did the Suthron Spears on every Side, Pierce his good Horse with cruel Wounds and wide. In this sad Pickle Wallace by and by, Thought it convenient for him now to fly. Spurr'd up his Horse, lamenting still for Graham, Then to his Folks at Carron Water came. The Sea was in they stopped there and stood, Aloud he cry'd and bade them take the Flood. Accordingly the Host they all obey, He follows on in all the Hast he may. Who clad was with a heavy Coat of Mail Which made him fear his wounded Horse would fail. Yet thro' the Flood he bore him to the Land, Then fell down dead (poor Beast) upon the Sand. But Kierly soon re-mounted Wallace Wight, Upon a Horse, both able, sound, and tight. Rode to his Host; but oh! Graham was away, And Fifteen more brave Scots on Mag'dlane Day. Yet Thirty Thousand of the Suthron Crew, Most certainly that Day the Scotsmen slew. What by the Stuart Stout and Wallace Wight, To Edward sure a most confounding Sight. To the Tor-wood Wallace commands his Host, Kierly and he march along Carron Coast. A Party on the other Side they spy, Bruce marching first, who does on Wallace cry. What art thou there? a Man Wallace did say, Yes said the Bruce, that hast thou prov'd this Day. Abide he said thou need'st not now to flee, Wallace reply'd, it's not for fear of thee, To talk with thee, the Bruce said I desire, Say on said he, thou may'st for little Hire. Ride from thine Host let them abide with Beik, I fain would hear what thou inclines to speak. What is the Cause said Bruce, thou wilt not cease From bloody Wars, who mayest live in Peace. It's thy own Fault said Wallace, be it known, Who shamefully dost fight against thy own. I claim no Right to rule, but to defend My native Land, from Edward and his Men. This Day thou's lost Two noble Knights and bold, Worth more than Millions of the finest Gold. The Stuart stout, the gallant Graham and wise, With that the Tears came trinkling from his Eyes. Thou that should be our true and Righteous King, Destroys thy own, a cruel horrid Thing But 'gainst the Suthron. I must tell you Sir, Come Life come Death, I'll fight with all my Birr. But wilt thou do as I shall Counsel give Said Bruce, and as a Lord thou mayest live At thine own Will, and enjoy every Thing In Peace, if thou wilt hold of Edward King No, No, said Wallace with Disdain and Scorn, I'd rather choose be hang'd upon the Morn, The great GOD knows, the Wars I took in Hand, Was to keep free what thou does now gainstand. In cursed Time thou was for Scotland born, O Runnagado, Faithless and Mansworn. I vow to GOD may I thy Master be, In any Field thou shalt far rather die, Than Turk or Pagan; this I shall keep good, Thou grand devourer of thy native Blood. Bruce smil'd and said, with Pow'r you'r overset, You'll ne'er the upper Hand of Edward get. Wallace reply'd this Day we're stronger far, And I am sure much more expert in War, Than when at Biggar, where he run for fear, And left his Host, so doubtless shall he here. Shall I leave Scotland now in such a Plight, No Faith not I, till I redress its Right. Well, said the Bruce, it now draws towards Night, Will you meet me the Morrow when its Light At Dunipace, and I do promise fair, By Nine a Clock to here thy Council there. No Wallace said, tho' Edward, had it sworn, I'll have a Bout with him e'er Nine the Morn. But if thou'll meet me at the Hour of Three, By all that's good I doubtless shall thee see. Bruce promis'd with Twelve Scotsmen to be there, Wallace with Ten, which both kept to a Hair. Thus did they part, and Bruce rode on his Way, Near to Linlithgow where King Edward lay. Into the King's Pavilion then does get, Where with the Lords he was at Supper set, Bruce sitting down in his own vacant Seat, Call'd for no Water, but went straight to Meat. Tho' all his Weapons and his other Weed, Were stain'd with Blood, yet he began to feed: The Suthron Lords did mock him in terms Rude, And said behold yon Scot eats his own Blood. The King he blush'd at this so Home a Jest, And caus'd bring Water to the Bruce in hast. They bade him wash, he told them he would not, The Blood is mine, which vexes most my Thought. Then did he sadly to his Mind recal, And did believe what Wallace told him all. With rueful Thoughts, the Bruce most sadly tost I leave; and follow Wallace to his Host. At the Tor-Wood, where speedily he goes, Sleeped a little and thereafter rose. His Host consisting of Ten Thousand Men, Drew quickly up in noble Order then, The Earl Malcolm, Ramsay, Lundie wight. Command Five Thousand gallant Men and tight. VVallace himself Lauder, and Seaton have Led on Five Thousand valiant Men and brave. VVith them good Wallace was of Riccartoun, VVho never spar'd but hew'd the Suthron down. All well aray'd in Armour bright, and clean, March'd to the Field, where the great Fight had been There narrowly they searched all the same, And found the Corps of good Sir John the Graham, Whom when good Wallace saw, he lighted down, And did embrace that Knight of high Renown. With Sorrow great beholding his Pale Face. He kiss'd his Mouth, and often cry'd Alace. My dearest Brother that I ever had, My only Friend, when I was hard bestead. My Hope, my Health O Man of Honour great. My Faithfull Aid and Strength in every Strait. Thy matchless Wisdom cannot here be told, Thy noble Man-hood, Truth, and Courage bold, Wisely thou knew to rule, and to govern, Yea Virtue was thy chief and great Concern. A bounteous Hand, a Heart as true as Steel, A steady Mind, most courteous and gentile. When I this Kingdom did at first rescue, Great Honour then I'm sure to thee was due. Wherefore I vow to the great GOD and swear, Thy Death shall be to Suthron bought full dear. Martyr thou art for Scotland's Right this Day, Which I'll avenge with all the Might I may. With that he sigh'd, and hugg'd him o'er again, Was no Man there from weeping could refrain. Then in Falkirk prepares his Sepulchre, And does his noble Corps in Pomp interr: On his Tomb-Stone the following Epitaph They wrote, which put the Suthron in a Chaff Mente manuque potens, et VALLÆ fidus Achates, Conditur hic Gramius bello interfectus ab Anglis. Of Mind and Courage stout, WALLACE's true Achates Here lies Sir JOHN the GRAHAM, Fell'd by the English Baties: Unto the Bruce Wallace he forthwith rade, To the Appointment was betwixt them made. At sight of whom, his Face flusht in a Flame, When he thought on the Loss of gallant Graham: Does thou not rue said he in angry Mood, Thy fighting 'gainst thy native Flesh and Blood. Oh! said the Bruce rebuke me now no more, My foolish Deeds do check and bite me sore Wallace surprized, was put to a Stance, Fell on his Knees and chang'd his Countenance. At which the Bruce embrac'd him in his Arms, And thus the Two came in good speaking Terms. Pray Sir said Wallace leave that Suthron King, The Bruce said that were an ignoble Thing; I am so bound, faithful to be and leill, For England I'll not falsifie my Seal. But here I Promise unto GOD and thee, Hereafter Scots shall ne'er be harm'd by me. And if you Victors be, as grant you may, I will not fight to save my Life this Day, But with King Edward I'll return again, Unless that I be taken or be slain. And when my Term with him is fairly out, May I escape I'll come to thee no doubt. Thus Bruce took Leave and did to Edward post, And Wallace soon returned to his Host. Crawford he made the Earl Malcolm's Guide, To Inneravin the low way to ride, That Suthron Watches might not them espy, The other Host himself led hastily. By the South Manwel, where they were not seen Of the Outwatches, there had planted been. The Earl Malcolm enters Lithgow now, Where a hot Dispute quickly did ensue. Wallace and his made little Noise or Cry, But on King Edward's Host fell suddenly. And did their Weapons Gallantly imploy, To his great Terror, but the Scotsmens Joy. Tents and Pavilions were cast to the Ground, Numbers of Suthron cut in Pieces down. Edward he calls on Bruce, to round him then, With Twenty Thousand of well harnish'd Men But the Surprise put them in such a Ghast, That they were flying from all Quarters fast. Wallace his Way thro' them did cut so clean, As if he had more than a Mortal been. Edward himself most bravely did behave, Which to his Men both Life and Vigour gave. Yet nothing could the Scottish Courage tame. When they thought on the loss of Gallant Graham. They fought like Furies in that dreadful Throng, And 'mongst the Suthron rais'd a dolefull Song, The English Commons fled on every Side, But the best sort did with the King abide, 'Mongst whom was Bruce, who did behold the Dance, And looked on with feigned Countenance. Lord Hartford then did make him for the Flight. Unto his King a mortifying Sight. Who all this Time to flee a Foot disdains, Untill the Scots 'most seiz'd his Bridle Reins. His Banner-Man close by him Wallace slew Next to the Ground the Banner quickly flew. At which the Scots were not a litle glad, And then the King and all his Army fled, Ten Thousand dead were in the Town and Field, Before King Edward once his Ground would yeild. Yet Twenty Thousand fled of Suthron Men, Tho' at the first brave Wallace had but Ten, The Scots in haste the Victory pursue, All brave bold Men, stout like the Steel and true. But Wallace wisely caus'd them close abide. In a full Body and good Order ride. Lest Suthron might at some convenient Place, If they dispers'd, ralzy and turn the Chace. In good Array thus rode they at his will, And all they overtook did quickly kill, They came so close upon the Suthron's Rear, None from the Army durst come off for fear. Ten Thousand Straglers joyn'd the Suthron Host Thus Thirty Thousand fled to England Post. Tho' the Scots Horse were almost spent yet they, Caus'd Edward change his Horses oft that Day, And then the Scots so closs upon them drew, Three Thousand of the outmost Men they slew. In Crawford Moor many a Man was slain, Then Edward calls the Bruce to him again; To charge the Scots with all his Power and Might, For which he should be put in his own Right. Then said the Bruce, Sir, loose me of my Band, And I shall turn, I give you here my Hand. When from the Bruce this Answer he did get, He knew his Heart on Scotland then was set. From that Time forth, Edward most subtilly, Over the Bruce did cast a watchful Eye. Bruce turned not, nor further Language made, But with King Edward unto Solway rade. Who when he came upon the English Coast, Found, that he Fifty Thousand Men had lost. VVallace returns to Edinburgh without more, Makes Crawford Captain as he was before. The like he did unto his Judges all, Each in his former Office did install. Thus he to Scotland Peace and great Content Procur'd; and then streight to St. Johnstoun went: Where all the Scottish Lords assembl'd were, To whom he all his Progress did declare By this Time Scrimzeor had reduc'd Dundee, Then on a Gallows Mortoun hang'd was high. Next was the Castle all in Rubbish laid, And Scots no more of Suthron were afraid. The noble Lords Wallace did then address, And with good Air himself did thus express. My Lords said he, since over all your Force You made me Gen'ral, both of Foot and Horse, I hope your Lordships plainly all do see, Once more I've set this ancient Kingdom free. And yet for all my Service, secretly, Some do reproach me, what a Pox care I. With what's Ignoble I dare boldly say, There's none can charge me standing here this Day. To stay at Home no longer I incline, My Office therefore freely I resign. No Gift I ask as my Reward or Fee, I've Honour purchas'd, that's enough for me. I'll back to France where I had Laud and Praise, And spend the rest of my remaining Days. The Lords did all oppose it, but in fine, Was no Man there could make him change his Mind. Most heartily he bad them all farewell, Then march'd with Eighteen Men as stout as Steel. The Baron's Sons of Brechin with him went, And Longoveil, on Honour always bent. Simon, and Richard, Wallace Nephews brave, Went both along for Honour or a Grave. Sir Thomas Gray the Priest with him did fare, Good Edward Little, Jop, and Mr. Blair. And Kierly who, had long with Wallace been, Thro' all the Wars, and bloody Bouts had seen. With those brave Men he shipped at Dundee, Then hoised Sail, and fairly set to Sea. CHAP. II. How WALLACE met with John of Lyn at Sea. Along the English Coast they steered South, Till opposite they came to Humber Mouth. Then in the Sea a Ship did soon descry, And on the Top Three Leopards standing High Which when the Merchants narrowly did view, Discourag'd were, and did their Voyage rue. Knowing full well that it was John of Lyn, Scots Blood to shed, who never thought it Sin. Good Wallace smil'd and said be not dismay'd, Of one poor single Ship why thus afraid. Those Wood Cats fled us, and were frighted sore, When Twice so many oftentimes before, On a fair Field so shall they be at Sea, If Suthron they and we true Scotsmen be. That he's a Pyrat said the Steers-Men know, And saves no Scotsman be he high or low. A Flood he bears on his Armorial Coat, First kills, then drowns, what Mischief does he not? Wallace reply'd, since that the Case is so, I'll sail the Ship, you Cowards get below. Then his brave hardy valiant Men and he, Array'd themselves in Harnish Cap a Pee. Himself and Blair and the Knight Longoveil, Command the Mid-Ship, and defend it well. Before were Eight, Six he be-eft did send, And Two he caus'd unto the Top ascend. Gray Steers-Man was, which when the Merchants saw, They Courage took altho' but Sogeors raw. Some Skins with Wool they hastily did stuff, This was their Harness, 'stead of Steel and Buff. At which good Wallace very gently smiles But does Commend their artificial VViles, Then John of Lyne with Seven-score in his Barge, Comes up and calls to Strike a hasty Charge. At which Three Arrows Blair with a good will Shot, and a Pirat at each Shot did kill. The Bloody Rogues, and cruel Hellish Hounds, Before they clasp'd, Mischiev'd the Scots with Guns. But when they clasped, this I wot right well, The Scottish Spears did pierce their finest Steel. The Pirat's Shot drove thick as a Hail Show'r, Most furiously the space near of an Hour. When Shot was gone, the Scots do Courage take. And with stout Handy Blows great havock made The Merchants in their Woollen Harness then, Behav'd themselves also like gallant Men. Wallace and his, with sharp Swords furiously, Cut down the Rogues, and made them quickly die. Then John of Lyn was very much agast, To see his Men about him fall so fast. With eager will he would have been away. Bade teck the Ship in all the hast they may. But all in vain, for now he plainly sees, His Sails by Crawford set unto a Bleeze. Burn'd down in Ashes, without all Remead, And Sixty of his best Men lying dead. Boarding the Pirat, Wallace in the Sea Did throw a Rogue, then killed other Three. Brave Longoveil the Knight and Mr. Blair, No Quarters gave to any they found there. Off John of Lyn Wallace the wight and brave, The Head and Helmet from his Body drave And then his Men did cut down all the rest. That did so long the Seas before infest. Then to the Sluys straightway did Wallace sail, With a successful, and a prosp'rous Gale. Took all the Gold and Silver that he fand, The Merchants got the Ship, then he to Land Thro' Flanders rode, soon passed o'er the same, Then entered France, and unto Paris came, Which Tidings came unto the King in haste, To whom good Wallace was a welcome Guest. Unto the Parliament the King did then, For a good Lordship VVallace recommend. Who, 'cause that Guyen was out of their Hand, They thought it best to gift him all that Land. For well they knew he bravely fought before, And did the Suthron mortally abhor. This Decreet soon they shew'd unto the King, Who highly was displeased at the Thing. But Wallace said, no Land pleas'd him so well, And that the Suthron they should quickly feel. Immediately the King he made him Knight, And gave him Gold for to maintain his Right. And order'd all the Army of that Land, For to obey what Wallace did Command. I thank you Sir said he, for this Reward, Yon Suthron, Faith shall be no longer spar'd And now my Time I will no longer waste, But to the Wars I will prepare in haste. The Scotsmen all that were into that Land, About him flock'd, and came with Heart and Hand. With Longoveil a num'rous Force arose, And to the Wars all with good Wallace goes. Ten Thousand Men in Number then were they, Who did the Scottish Banner soon display. To Guyen marched all those good Men and true Cast Castles down, and many Suthron slew. They carry'd all before them in a Word, None could, or durst resist their Fire and Sword. Shemon which Wallace took before, they win, And kill the Suthron all were found therein. Into that Town Wallace made his Abode. And did subdue all that whole Country broad. The Duke of Orleans with Twelve Thousand bright, Came to assist him and desend his Right. Thus in his Town I leave him fairly fix'd, And must speak something now of Scotland next. CHAP. III. How Edward King of England came into Scotland, and made whole Conquest thereof. Vallange the Knight, to Scotland did repair, The false Montieth Sir John did meet him there. Sir John the Lennox greatly did desire, To whom Sir Aymer promis'd it in Hire. To hold in Fee, and other Lands moe, Of Edward; if to London he would go. Thus they accorded and to London went, Which pleas'd King Edward to his Hearts content. Montieth on sight was bound to that fierce King, In Scotland to assist him, in each Thing. Then both return'd no longer there did wait, Pox on their nasty Snouts for Villains great. For the Montieth told Edward every Thing, And that the Scots designed Bruce for King. Within the Space I think of Forty Days, King Edward did a swinging Army raise. To Scotland march'd and no Resistance fand, VVere none that Time that could his Force withstand. All the Scots Forts, and Castles, in a Word, He got without a single Stroke of Sword. So Fierce, so Cruel, was this King and bold, The noble Lords that would not of him hold, To English Prisons he did quickly send, Where good Sir William Douglas made his End. The Earl Thomas Lord of Murray then, And the Lord Frazer Two brave Noblemen: With Hugh the Hay and many Nobles moe, With Villain Vallange did for England go. Seaton, and Lauder, in the Bass did dwell, And Lundie, that could act his Part full well. The Earl Malcolm, and the Campbel brave, Bute as their Place of Refuge taken have. Ramsay and Ruthven both fled to the North. Unto their Cousin the Lord of Fillorth. He past with them thro' Murray Land outright, And there they found a Gen'rous worthy Knight Clement to Name, who ever still had been. Against the Suthron, valiant, stout and keen. He led those Lords to Ross with greatest care, And at Stockfoord a Strength he builded there. Good Adam Wallace Craigy, Boyd, those Three, Fled all to Arran, one Night by the Sea. Into Dunbar, Corspatrick dwelt at will, But pay'd his Fewty to King Edward still. Lord Abernethy, Soulis and Cummine als, And John of Lorn, that long Time had been false. The Lord of Brechin, many other moe, To Edward's Peace, for Gifts did frankly go. Then do the Lords and others send Express, From Bute to Wallace with a long Address. “Our Hope our Health, our Governour most great, “Our Chiftain true, and Help in every Strait. “Our Lord and Love, thy Absence does us grieve, “For God's Sake come, and once more us relieve, “And take the Crown, for we protest and swear, We'll not consent that Edward shall it wear. This Writ he got, which vex'd him in his Mind, Tho' then an Answer he did not incline. By this King Edward in Lord York his Hand, From Tay to Dee had lodg'd the sole Command. For's Father's sake and good Sire's, this was giv'n, Who both were kill'd; by Wallace, at Kincleven Lord Bewmont, to command the North was sent. And then from Perth Edward to Stirling went The Lord of Clifford who had Douglasdale, Was Rider made of the South Marches hail. All Galloway the Cummine got in Hand, For such a Rogue too good and large a Land. The Bishop of St. Andrews, Lambertoun, At this Time kept the Douglas of Renown. To whom the Bishop great Affection bore, But durst not show't when Suthron were before. Yet made he Douglas on a Day to go, With him to Stirling 'cause he lov'd him so. Where from King Edward (tho' it prov'd in vain,) He begg'd the Douglas Land to hin again. Who when he knew him Douglass Son to be, Swore by St. George, no Land he's get from me. His Father fought against my Crown alway For which he in my Prison lies this Day. No other Answer there the Bishop got, Because the Douglas was so true a Scot. He gave the Merse to Soullis that Limmer Lown. And made him Captain too of Berwick Town, When Stirling Castle Oliphant resign'd, He thought, that Writ would surely Edward bind: But O! such horrid Treatment and absurd He violate his Faith, and broke his Word: Sent him to England, to a Prison strong, In Misery where he continu'd long. When Edward had divided Scotland broad Away in Triumph the Usurper rode. VVith him was Cummine, that sweet dainty Dear, VVho whisper'd softly in the Bruce's Ear: If you'll keep Counsel, I'll unto you show, What you before perhaps did never know. Say on said Bruce, what you reveal to me, I promise for my Part, conceal'd shall be, Then said Lord Cummine, Sir this is the Thing, O'er this Realm you should be righteous King. It's true said Bruce, but tho' I Righteous be, This is not now a proper Time for me. At present I'm in Edward's Hands, and loath, To break with him, and violate my Oath. Yet tho' he promis'd back this Land to me, Pray do not you and all the Nation see, How he divides and deals my Heritage, To Suthron some, and some for Traytors Wage. My Lordships Cummine said, I'll lay you down, If you'll resign your Title to the Crown. Or I shall help you with my Pow'r and Might, But Bruce reply'd, I will not sell my Right. Yet tell me what's the Lordship thou doest crave Which for thy Help, I promise thou shall have. Pray leave yon King said Cummine craftily, For Edward hath all Galloway given to me. And Soullis my Nephew, Berwick does Command, VVe both shall follow you with Heart and Hand. My other Nephew a great Man of Might, The Lord of Lorn will help you to your Right. My Nephew Third, Barron of Brichen bold, Shall rise with us, thus I my Tale have told. Then said the Bruce it were a lucky Chance, Could we get Wallace back again from France. This Kingdom he redeem might yet once more, VVe're too long Strangers, which I rue full sore. This with the Cummine did not well go down. For he himself an Eye had to the Crown. Yet that same Night they did compleat the Band, And seal'd the same most fairly with their Hand. This Paper Bruce left with the Cummine there, Then with King Edward did to England fare. And did remain untill it was made known, Three Years and more before he claim'd his own. Some thinks that Cummine did disclose the Thing Because his VVife was Cousin to the King. But had the Bruce gone to St. Johnstoun Town, By whole Assent he had receiv'd the Crown: And then he might have execute the Law 'Gainst Cummine, and keep'd all such Rogues in Aw. The End of the Eleventh Book The Twelfth BOOK OF Sir William Wallace. CHAP. I. How WALLACE conquer'd the Land of Guyen and was made Lord thereof. In Guyen Wallace carried on the War, And had the better of the English far. In Five set Battles did them so defeat, To Burdeous they all made their Retreat. Wallace pursues, and did invest the Town Full Twenty Days; broke Forts and Bulwarks down But Victuals falling short, it did oblige Him, and his Army to give o'er the Siege. Then to the King in Pomp he went at last, And gave Account of all the Action past. Who did rejoice that Guyen Land was won, And thanked Wallace for his Service done By this Time came from Scotland an Express, With a most Humble, but a neat Address, Unto the King, beseeching him to send, Good Wallace Home, his Country to defend, From Rage, and Fury, of the Suthron Foe Which did the Kingdom then all overflow; And that he would advise him soon withal; To take the Crown, and ease them of their Thrall. Which they did suffer, from a King unjust, Or else in short the Nation perish must. This was the very Substance of the Thing, Which the Address contain'd unto the King. But yet the King concealed all was writ, Lov'd not to part so soon with Wallace yet. Who liv'd as great at Shemon, as a Prince, And none more happy liv'd there ever since. About this Time, a certain proud French Knight: Did boldly claim an heritable Right: Unto some Office, and to sundry Lands Of Guyen, which was then in Wallace Hands. Whither the Answer which the Monsieur got. Pleas'd or displeas'd his Worship, I know not. He an Appointment does with Wallace make, Pretending Service under him to take. But that was not what the great Rogue design'd, For something else was in his Bloody Mind. With Fifteen each, at the appointed Place Meet, and salute with a becoming Grace. But the false Knight his Treachrie soon display'd, Had Fourty armed Men in Ambush laid; Who all, so soon as he with Wallace met, Had Orders to enclose him in their Net. In Angry Mood then spoke the Gallick Knight, Thou does possess my Lands by no good Right. In modest Terms replyed Wallace brave, I have no Lands but what the King me gave And which I wan in perill of my Life. From Suthron Foes in a most Bloody Strife, Then said the Knight thou shalt them here Resign, Or lose thy Life, by all that is Divine. Then draws his Sword, whereby he soon Alarms. The Ambush, which appear in glitt'ring Arms. By which surprising, unexpected fight, Wallace perceiv'd the Treach'ry of the Knight. Are these the Thanks said he, I from your Hand Get; for restoring of your Native Land. Altho' I Armour want, as do my Men, Tho' but Sixteen, 'gainst Fifty-Six, what then? Here is a Sword made of the truest Steel, Which thy deserving Neck shall shortly feel, Then with one single Stroke cut down the Knave And bade him purchase for himself a Grave. At which the Fifty Five, fierce Gallicks then, Environ'd Wallace and his Fifteen Men, Who like brave Scots, with noble Hearts and true Fought, and a great deal of the Frenchmen slew. 'Mongst whom was the Knight's Brother stout and strong, Who fought it like a Fury very long. And dealt his Blows about him very fast, But was cut all in Peices down at last. Closs by, Nine Frenchmen were a mowing Hay, Who do advance with all the speed they may. Each, a sharp Syth into his rustick Hand, As if forsooth none might their Force withstand. Nor was there any that could do it then, Save only Wallace, that brave Prince of Men; Who as soon as he could the Rogues descry, Did leave his Men and then immediatly: Most boldly, did towards the Clowns advance, Mock'd such Machines and all the Syths in France The first he met, ill may the Carle Thrive, At Wallace with his Weapon made a Drive Had it a hit him as it miss'd, I vow, No doubt it would have cut his Body through. But Wallace being hearty, brisk and blyth, Most cliverly he overleap'd the Syth. Then with his Sword gave such a backward Blow, As kill'd the Fellow, a brave Rary-show As in that Country e'er before was seen, To see his Head hap, happing on the Green. The next Clown's Syth he also jumped o'er, And clove his Shoulder half a Yard and more. Unto the Third most nimbly play'd the same, Then at the Fellow such a Stroke did frame, As gave him a prodigious Mortall Wound, Till he gasp'd out his Last upon the Ground, The Fourth he clove him cleanly thro' the Coast: Let him take that, for all his Brag and Boast. The Three first Syths, Wallace did overleap, And by good Providence did thus escape. Four Men he kill'd, one still at every Stroke, Upon my Word it was a pretty Joke, He that was last, was the first Man that fled, Else he had got the cold Ground for his Bed. Good VVallace then the Fifth does closs, pursue, O'ertakes him quickly, and the Fellow slew. Then marched back, to his own Men again, Who Fourty Nine had of the Frenchmen slain. Seven did escape, and fled with all their Might, A marvellous, but true and bloody Fight, Four of the Mowers did no more incline, To stay, but scour'd, and left their Syths behind. Or else of them there had been News belyve, Such as perhaps, befell the other Five. Thus was the Knight, and's Men, caught in the Net, Which basely they had for brave Wallace set. For most of all were kill'd, the Rest they fled, At which the King he was exceeding glad For Wallace sent, and pray'd him earnestly, That he might one of his own Houshold be. Where he might live in Peace, and rest secure, Under the Covert of his royal Bow'r. For well he knew that some envious were, At Favours, which the King bestow'd him there. No Wonder, for he rescu'd in few Days, All Guyen Land to his immortal Praise. In spite of all the Suthron's Force, and Pow'r, Syn made them scamper off themselves, and scour. And when he fairly did it thus reduce, Did chase the Suthron all to Burdeous. Then Two full Years remain'd at the French Court, And was diverted with all princely Sport; King, Lords and Ladies, much of him did make, Both for his own, and ancient Scotland's Sake. 'Cause 'twixt the Kingdoms, there had been so long A kind Alliance and a very strong. CHAP. II. How WALLACE killed the Two French Champions. With the French King did dwell, Two Champions great, Who mortally did the Scots Hero hate. Express'd themselves in most Satyrick Joke, And with Disdain 'gainst Scotland always spoke. Which fired our brave Champion very soon, With him such Language would not well go down. This verifies the Proverb we may see, Two of a Trade in one Place ne'er agree. Save in the Case, of these French Champions, who, Linked in others Arms did always go. At length it so fell out, and chanc'd that they, VVere all Three left upon a certain Day. Themselves alone, discoursing in a Hall, Where they no Weapons us'd to wear at all, There did the Champions talk of Scotland long With great Contempt, which Wallace said was wrong. Since both our Nations live in Friendship great And firm Alliance, what means all this Hate. Did we not help you lately in your Need, We do deserve good Words, for our good Deeds. What would you say of the Proud Suthron Foe, When of your Friends you talk at Random so. With slighting Words in their own Language they Disdainfully replyed, and did say: The Suthron are our Foes we grant and own, But Scots for Falshood ev'ry where are known. At which good Wallace was inraged so. One of the Champions got a fearfull Blow, Which foundred the proud Coxcomb where he stood, Made Mouth and Nose gush out in Streams of Blood. The other struck at Wallace in great hast, Not doubting but his Friend was now deceas'd. Whom Wallace gripp'd, fo fast and wondrous sore His Sp'rit departed and he ne'er spake more. The first arose and smote at Wallace fast, But their Death Strokes he gave them both at last. Upon a Pillar he dash'd out their Brains, And said, let them take that up for their Pains. What Devil ail'd the Carlos, they're to blame, It would been long e'er I had troubled them. Unto themselves they only owe their Paiks, If they have won, let them take up their Staiks. And let all others learn when they are young, Strictly to bridle the unruly Tongue. Many great Lords of the first Rank in France, Were much displeas'd at this unlucky Chance But the good King who knew the Story all, Did wave the Thing and kindly let it fall. And did exoner Wallace the same Day. So after that no Man had ought to say. Nor once durst give him, but a Saucie look, Or yet play bo, unto his Blanket Nook. CHAP III. How WALLACE killed the Lyon. The King of France by no Means does neglect, To put on Wallace Marks of great Respect. For many Battles had he fought and won, And for the King, great Fates and Service done. Had Guyen Land from Suthron Foes redeem'd. And was a mighty Conqueror esteem'd. Which gall'd the Courtiers, almost put them mad. That he was in such Estimation had. And 'cause he had the Two French Champions kill'd, Were with Envy great Spite and Malice fill'd. For plainly they discover'd now and saw, It was the King protect'd him from the Law. For which Two Squires hellishly do plot, How to destroy the brave Heroïck Scot. Who near Relations were as you must know, Unto the late deceased Champions Two. And in this Manner do they undertake, The Wallace brave a Sacrifice to make. The King a cruel Lyon had, which scarce Could be govern'd, was so exceeding fierce. Which the Two Squires, knowing by and by. Came to the King and forg'd a cursed Lie. This Scot said they his Bragg and Boast doth make, And plainly says that he will undertake To fight your Lyon, if you'll freely give, Him your Allowance, Liberty, and Leave. This he desired us of you to ask, We'er sure he'll have a most difficult Task. To which with great Concern reply'd the King, I'm sorry he desires such a Thing. Yet I will not deny what e'er may chance, The Favour that he'll ask me while in France. Gladly away they went to Wallace, where, Like Rogues they counterfit the Story there. VVallace said they, the King Commands that you Will fight his Lyon without more ado. Wallace replys, what ever is his will, Unto my Pow'r most gladly I'll fulfill. Then to the King did instantly repair. A Lord at Court when he saw Wallace there Most foolishly, ask'd him if he durst fight With the fierce Lyon, who reply'd on Sight. Yes truely if the King would have it so, Or with your self, I fear none of the Two. Let Cowards from Kings Courts be all debar'd, I may be worsted, but shall ne'er be dar'd. So long's my Nostrils any Breath remains, Or Scottish Blood does circle in my Veins. Like a true Scot I'll fight and scorn to fly, For why, I know that Man is born to dye, Then by the King in short it granted was, That Wallace might unto the Lyon pass. Yet all this Time knew nothing of the Plot, So deeply laid against the Noble Scot. Nor in the Matter further did enquire, Thinking it was good Wallace own Desire. Mean Time of him so Tender was the King, He order'd Harness quickly there to bring. No Wallace said, I leave that to the Field, Almighty God shall only be my Shield, Since this is but a Beast and not a Man, With what I have, I'll fight him as I can. And will encounter single as I goe, This strong rapacious, cruel savage Foe. About one Hand he did his Mantle wrap, And in the other did his broad Sword clap. Then briskly without any furder stay, Came to the Place where the fierce Lyon lay. Who ramping rose against him where he stood, Dreadfully roar'd, expecting present Blood, Then Wallace drew a Stroke from Neck to Heel, With his good Sword made of the burnish'd Steel, And gave the Lyon such a dreadful Blow, As cut his Body cliverly in two. Then to the King he call'd aloud in Ire, Pray Sir said he, is this your whole Desire? Thus to expose me to the Rage and Will, Of your fierce Lyon, have you more to kill? Cause bring them forth, such Beasts since I must quell, I will obey, so long's I with you dwell. But now of France for ever I take leave, Some greater Action I may soon atchieve. At Shemon, Sir, I thought the other Year, You would have other Bus'ness for me here. Than fight a cruel savage Beast, wherefore, To Ancient Scotland I'll return once more. The King perceiving Wallace in a Fire, Meekly reply'd it was your own Desire. Else by the Faith of a most Christian King, I never would allow of such a Thing. For Men of Honour ask'd it in your Name, So you or they are only for to blame. Wallace reply'd I vow to the great God, This seems to me a Thing both Strange and Odd By all that's Good no higher can be sworn, I know no more on't, than the Child unborn. Of Honour sure I have a better Taste, Than to be proud to sight a savage Beast. This is a Trick devis'd by some of those, Who are my secret and Malicious Foes. The King conceiving there was Falshood wrought, Caus'd both the Squires quickly to be brought: Who when they came, the Crime could not deny: But plainly did confess the Treachery. For which, and other must ungodly Deeds, The King commanded to strike off their Heads. Thus came the Squires to their fatal End, As did the Champions, to all Men be't kend. The Champions first, for their Disdain and Flout At Scotland, justly got their Brains beat out. The Squires next, for Malice and Envy, Did lose their Heads and most deservedly. For our Instruction then, we may reflect. Nothing from Justice Villains can protect. Each Rogue, altho' with Nick he should combine: Shall be discov'red either soon or syne. And may be certain of a Rogue's Reward, Vertue and Honour who does not Regard, As in the sacred Scriptures we may read, But to my Purpose further I proceed. When Wallace saw the Court envy'd him so, To Scotland then he purposed to go: To aid his Country, and to take his Chance, Despising all the Wealth he had in France. Once more his Native Land for to relieve, Which Suthron Foes did now afflict and grieve. And to its pristine Freedom it restore, Or else he vow'd that he should dy therefore. The King perceiving Wallace that Way bent, Gave him the Letter that was lately sent. From the Scots Lords, which he read and perus'd, Then told the King he must have him excus'd. For he in France no longer could remain, But must return to Scotland back again. Since that his Country was distressed so, Being invaded by the Suthron Foe. But to abridge my Story and be short, Wallace takes leave of King and all the Court. At which the King did sorrowful appear, And to the Chamber quickly did retire. Jewels and Gold he gave him in that Hour, For to support his Honour and Grandeur. But Lords and Ladies did lament and grieve, And weeped sore when Wallace took his Leave, No Man he took with him of Note, or Might. To Scotland back, but Longoveil the Knight. Who loved Wallace with so true a Heart, What e'er befel, would never from him part, Towards the Sluce in goodly Order past, A Vessel got and made to Sea at last. Eight Seamen had, as good as were alive, And then at Tay did safely all arrive. CHAP. IV. How WALLACE came again to Scotland, and The Battle of Elchock Park. Wallace in silent Watches of the Night Did land his Men, long time e'er it was Light. And by good Luck, before the break of Day, The Ship shear'd off, and safely got away, From Earn's Mouth, to Elchok quickly then, He march't with Eighteen stout brave valiant Men. Who, when he had approached pretty near, To Crawford's House his own Relation dear. In the back-side, a Window there did find, Thro' which he called for his Cousin kind Who when he knew that it was Wallace wight Did not delay but came to him on Sight. Embrac'd and kiss'd you may be very sure, It was a blythsome, glad and joyfull Hour. How to dispose of Wallace and his Men, Was the next Point to be considered then. How to secure them, till they got some Rest, And were with Meat and Drink and Sleep refresh't In a great Mow of Corn he them did darn, Most cunningly within a spacious Barn. On the North-Side a private Hole was wrought, Thro' which they had all due Provision brought. For Bed and Board nothing they lack'd at all, The Time they lodg'd within that threshing Hall. In their Corn-Castle most securely dwelt, For several Days, and no Disturbance felt. Till Meat fell short unto the honest Core, Then to St. Johnstoun, Crawford went for more. Where subtile Suthron Foes most cunningly, Took notice what Provision he did buy. And thought the Quantity a great deal more, Then he was wont to buy in Times before. For which immediatly they him suspect, And honest Crawford's gripped by the Neck. Where Brevi manu without any Shade Of Law, or Justice, he's in Prison laid. What Guests has thou said one, and for who's Sake Does thou so mighty great Provision make Crawford reply'd, Sir, I have ne'er a Guest, All this is only for a kirking Feast. But it was dreaded and alleg'd by some, That Wallace, he from France was lately come. And that they might know whether it was true, Most subtilly devise what's next to do. Set's Crawford free, and in good Harness then, Do quickly put Eight Hundred chosen Men. And at a due convenient Distance, from Good honest Crawford, they do Dog him Home. Whom when good Wallace saw, he did exclaim Against his Conduct, said, he was to blame. Who did expose himself so much unto, The cunning Notice of the Suthron Foe. In sleep this Night, by Vision I was told, That thou had me unto the Suthron sold. Sir, that shall be the last Thing I'll attempt, My Neck has not such itching after Hemp. Black be their Cast great Rogues to say no more, Their Generation all I do abhore. Yea, for my Country, since I went away, I did expect my dearest Blood should pay, And that I should no doubt a Martyr been, And never more the Scottish Hero seen. The Prison strong, and cruel, where I lay, Will testify the Truth of what I say. Quickly get up, and take you to the Fields, I greatly fear the Rogues are at my Heels. I'll give you all Assistance that I can; For I my self shall be the Twentieth Man. The worthy Scots got up, with merry speed, Unto their Arms, and were not slack indeed. Then suddenly, the Suthron all appear, Eight Hundred Men in Armour bright and clear. And on their Head was Butler that young Knight, To Twenty Men a formidable Sight. When Wallace saw, his Number was so few, He from the Plains to Elchok Park withdrew. Where he a certain sort of Pass espy'd, Which nat'rally was so well fortify'd, With great and closs grown Hollin, on each Hand, As might the Suthron's first Attack withstand. Great long tall Trees across he there did lay. Then to his Men couragiously did say: The Wood is thick, tho' small in breadth and length, Had we but Meat enough, we'd keep the Strength. Mean Time let us go on with Heart and Hand, And bravely fight so long as we can stand: For our old native Country, valiantly, Come let us to it either do or die. Before they gain the Pass, I'm much inclin'd, To lay some of their Bellies to the Wind. By this young Butler, Eager, Keen, and Crouss, With all his Men surrounded Crawford's House: But came too late as he himself did own, He got the Nest but all the Birds were flown. Poor Crawford's loving Wise they seiz'd anon, And ask'd at her what way the Scots were gone. She would not tell, for Boast, nor yet Reward, Then Butler said too long thou hast been spar'd. And caused build a great prodigious Fire, Then Swore an Oath in horrid Wrath and Ire, That he would burn her quick, Flesh, Blood and Bone, If she conceal'd what way the Scots were gone. Pray hold thy Hand said Wallace, do not so, For here I am, I own my self thy Foe. VVould thou Torment an honest sakeless VVife, Come forth to me and we shall end the Strife. It were great Sin to kill the Female Scot. Art thou a Christian, tell me, yea, or not, In all my Victories I here declare, Priests, Women, Children, always lib'rat were. When Butler had good Wallace fairly seen, And that he was alone upon the Green; He threw his Face, sometime his Lip did bite, His Bosom swell'd with Venom and with Spite: It was no Wonder, for to tell you plain, Wallace had both his Dad, and good Sire slain. The Suthron then fiercely march up at length, And Wallace he retir'd unto his Strength. Most hardily the Englishmen began Attacked sore, with many a Gallant Man. But Scots within did make a strong Defence, And Suthron Foes were soon repuls'd from thence. Who, at first Entry, Fifteen Men had kill'd With English Corps the Pass was almost fill'd. At which they all retire a litle back, In Order to another fresh Attack. Wallace beheld, and did distinctly see, Butler the Knight divide his Men in Three. Yon Knight said he, in War is so expert, And has it so engraven on his Heart, That he unto a very Point does know, Each Stratagem, and nice Punctilio. For by the Disposition of his Men, I know for certain that he does intend, So soon as he with his fresh Men comes back, Us in Three different Places to attack. A Brisk and brave Defence, then let us make, Dear Longoveil thou Six with thee shall take. As many with good Crawford here, shall go, And Five with me to stop the cruel Foe. In Three Divisions march the English Sparks, Butler's Divisions Wallace nicely marks. To the old Pass without all Dispute more They march, and do attack it very sore. Design'dly Wallace let some Suthron in, But to get out the Way, could never find. The first Seven Men that marched in the Front. When they got in look'd most confounded blunt: Wallace's Five, each one a Fellow slew, And Wallace Two, then bad the Seven adue. Butler was next, no further he durst pierce, But did retire, he saw the Scots so fierce. Good Longoveil and Crawford, fought so sore, That Time the Suthron sallied them no more. By this the Stars appeared in their Sight. Then suddenly approach'd the darksome Night, Butler the Watches set, to Supper went; But grieved that he, his Time had so ill spent Mean Time he eats a very plenteous Meal, Of good Provisions, Bread and English Ale. While the brave Wallace, nothing had at all, But Adam's Ale which we cold Water call. Yet with a cheerfull Countenance could say, Chear up my Lads it is not long to Day. What tho' we all, should fast one single Night, We fast for Honour and for Scotland's Right. Perhaps our Foes, that now so fully feed, The Morrow's Night shall no more Victuals need. The Earl York who Perth with Troups did sill, Commanded Butler to continue still. At Elchock Park, and he would Reinforce, Him with a fresh Supply of Foot and Horse. And that he would himself in Person come, With Sound of Trumpet and with Beat of Drum. Couragious York upon my Word well spoke Was he in Earnest pray, or but in Joke. To offer such a Reinforcement then, Unto Eight Hundred, against Twenty Men. This sure must add much to his Lordship's Praise, And blaze his Character in after Days. But Butler fain would have the Hero yeild, Before that York appear'd upon the Field. That he himself might have the Praise alone, Thanks to you Butler, Fourty Men to One. Then to the Park, the English Knight draws near, And calls on Wallace asking him what Chear. Good Chear said Wallace, you may take my Word, Then laid his Hand upon his awfull Sword. Here is the Blade that still keeps up my Heart, And many a Time has made the Suthron smart. With many a bloody Wound, both wide and deep, And may do so this Day before I sleep. Well said the Butler that is not my Fear, But I would talk a Moment with thee here. Content said Wallace, for a little Hire, I will not stand to grant thee thy Desire. Does thou not sore repent said Butler now, That thou my Father and my Good-Sire slew. No Wallace said, tho' it were thy whole Kin, To kill my Foes I never thought it Sin. Come they my Way I'll do the best I can, As GOD me save to kill them every Man. And hope I shall a good Occasion have, VVith these Two Hands to send thee to thy Grave. That is not likely said the Butler now, My Prisoner I'll make thee first I trow. Mean Time what I desire I pray thee grant, And what I promised thou shalt not want. With all my Heart said Wallace, every Bit, If Safety and true Honour will permit. Then Butler said, what Profit wilt thou reap Here to abide, since thou cannot escape. And since thou sees it may not better be, Leave off thy Folly, yeild they self to me With frowning Face and mighty great Disdain, The Scottish Hero did reply again. So great a Fool I never hope to prove, I'll yield to none but the great GOD above. To him each Day, Twice I do yield and bow, But little Mushrom Knight pray what art thou? Bids yield to thee, for all thy Haste and Heat, Faith that is not what I design as yet. And tho' we be but Twenty Scots what then? I mock thee much and thy Eight Hundred Men. To worship GOD said Butler, thou does well, And to thy Maker Twice a Day to kneel. Yet does thou Folly, and no Conduct show, When with my Men thou art inviron'd so, And closs surrounded, no way to get out, Thus to debate, tho' thou were ne'er so stout. Therefore come forth and make no more ado, Thou'll find my Counsel, wholsome Words and true. With great Disdain Wallace he smil'd, and leugh, And answ'ring said, Sir you have talk'd enough. For tho' all England had the contrair Sworn, I'll cut my Passage thro' you once the Morn. Or else this Night, believe me what I say, This shall be done before Nine of the Day. Butler was careful then, when it grew Dark. To plant his Watches all around the Park. There Wallace stay'd, no ways alarm'd or fear'd, Until the twinkling Morning Star appear'd. A Rocky Mist fell down at break of Day, Then thought he fit to make the best o's Way. Who, when he had made strict Search round about, Found a convenient Place, and then broke out. Then hastened to the Place where Butler lay, And round about him did great Numbers slay, Most nobly fought each Gallant worthy Scot, But Crawford he was wounded on the Spot. Whom in a Moment Wallace did rescue, Then at one Stroke he the bold Butler slew. Got Crawford up in his Two Arms e'er long And bravely did Defend him in the Throng. About him made great Room where he did stand, And cut Five Suthron down with his own Hand. Bore Crawford out, in spite of all were round, Nine Aikers breadth before he set him down. The Suthron finding Butler to be dead, And Thirty more, for which was no Remead, Do view the Corps, what could the Men do more, And then condole their Loss exceeding sore. Wallace by this was quite out of their Sight, The Mist had so eclipsed all the Light. At which he smil'd and said to Longoveil, Upon my Word this Mist assists us well. Then let us quickly March to Methven Wood, Where we shall get Provision very good. We fasted have so long, in Truth I trow, It's almost Time we had our Breakfast now. But by the Time they had got to the Hight, The Sun display'd his Beams, and radiant Light. By which they did perceive immediatly, Thirty and Four Men, in a Company, Then said good Wallace, be they Friend or Foe, Wee'l meet them, since their Number is no moe. When they approach'd, a noble Knight it was And a true trusty Friend Sir Hugh Dundass. With him a prudent Knight, brave Sir John Scot, Who in Strathern was then a Man of Note. And with Dundass's Sister led his Life, A verteous Lady and a loving Wife. They and their Men, the Road were passing on, To pay their Fewty to the Suthron. Because the Lord of Brechin's strict Command, Had forc'd them basely, thus to hold their Land. Who when they saw, that it was Wallace wight, Gave Thanks to GOD for that blyth welcome Sight. Glad of the Succour he had sent them there, To Methven Wood with joyful Hearts repair. Where they refresh'd themselves to their own Mind. With such Provisions as they there could find. Then were they hearty, cliver, brave, and tight, And unto Birnane Wood march'd all at Night. There they with Ruthven met in a short Space, Who long had liv'd an out-Law in that Place. From thence they march, and unto Athol go, Where Eatables were scarce, and Friends also. Then pass to Lorn, as little found they there, Of Wild, and Tame, that Land was stripped bare. Wherefore they most Religiously anon, Address the Heav'ns, and make a piteous Moan. Good Sir John Scot said, he would rather dye And starve with Hunger, then with Infamy. Mo live a Rogue, or let himself be bound, A slavish Subject to King Edward's Crown. Wallace his own Distress with Pience bore, But for the Rest he groan'd, and grieved sore. Of all this Want said he, I am the Cause, Yet since it is for Scotland's Rights and Laws. That thus we suffer, by the Divine will, Let none of us once grudge or take it ill. For he that made us by his mighty Pow'r, Can feed us by his Providence I'm sure, With him is neither found Deceit, nor Guile, Stay here till I remove a little while. In a short Space I shall return again, Then walked he o'er a Hill unto the Plain. VVhere in a Forrest underneath an Oak, He sat him down, with Spirit almost broke. His Sword and Bow, he leaned to a Tree, In Anguish great then on his Face sell he. Ah VVretch! said he, that ne'er could be content. VVith all the VVealth that GOD unto thee sent. The Lordships great, long since to thee assign'd, Could never please thy fierce unstable Mind. Thy willfull VVill to make thy Nation free, Thro' God's Permission's brought this VVoe to thee, For worthier by far than ever I, VVith Hunger now are like to starve and dy. O GOD I pray, relieve them of their Pain, And let not this my Prayer be in vain. Then after Sighs and Meditation deep, He slumber'd softly and did fall asleep. Five Bloody Rascals boldly with one Breath Had bound themselves under the pain of Death, To take the VVallace wight, dead or alive, Which prov'd their Ruin, for Old Nick did drive. Three of the base Assassins, English were, Scottish vile Villains were the other Pair, Three Days before, they travell'd had about Like bloody Hounds to find the Hero out. With them a Boy that us'd to carry Meat, Among the Hills and Rocky Mountains great. When Wallace did retire from his brave Men The Rogues most privatly were lurking then. Saw his Departure, dog'd him in his Way, And knew the Place exactly where he lay. In Covert of the Rocks they pass and peep, And plainly did perceive him fall asleep. Near to his Person then the Rogues aproach, Thinking they had him fast within their Lotch And then the Blood-Hounds put it to the Vote, To take alive or kill him on the Spot. One said could we get him but safe to Perth, It were our greatest Honour upon Earth His Sword and Bow no Safety more affords. Then let us tye and bind him fast with Cords. This we may do I'm sure at our own will, And lead him by the backside of yon Hill. So that his Men shall nothing thereof know, Content said they, then all to work they go. And thought thro' Force, him Prisoner to make, But brought to Bed soon of a grand Mistake. For when they gripp'd him, a sour Face he made, What is the Matter then he boldly said. About he turn'd him, out his Arms he threw, And with his Fists made them both Black and Blue. The fiercest and the stoutest Man took he, And dash'd his Brains all out against a Tree. Then with unparalelled Strength arose, In spite of his Four other bloody Foes. And boldly seized the dead Fellow's Sword, VVherewith he made sound Payment on my Word Another Suthron at a single Stroke, He hewed down before he left the Oak. The other Three sought, but full soon were glad, To take them to their Heels, and so they fled. But to escape they all in vain did strive, None could do so on Foot, from him alive. Then following fast their nimble speed he try'd, Gave them their mortal Wound, whereof they dy'd. As he returned from the Rogues with Joy He met with, and said to the Servant Boy. VVhat does thou here? who with a Pale dead Face, Fell on his Knees, and humbly asked Grace. I little have to do indeed said he, I lately hired was, for Meat and Fee. VVith yon Five Men, had I known their Design, Such Service ne'er had entered in my Mind. What's that thou carriest Boy? Sir it is Meat, Then come along with me it's Time to eat. Meat at this Time is better far than Gold, Its VVorth at present cannot well be told: Then with a chearfull merry Heart and glad, Went to his Men who all were quickly fed, With good rost Meat, plenty of Bread and Cheese, And did their Strength recover by Degrees. Thus Fifty Four refresh'd were, who before, Had fasted full Three Days and somewhat more. O mighty Miracle to see (GOD knows) A sleeping Man surrounded by his Foes, Ly open to their Fury on the Field, All VVeaponless, no Helmet, Sword nor Shield, Exposed thus unto their bar'brous will, And yet for all their VVrath no Pow'r to kill. Fifty and Four with Hunger almost starv'd, And yet from Sword, and Famine both preserv'd. VVhen all had fully ate, and drank also, How came this Meat said they, pray let us know. Then where the bloody Rognes all dead did ly He led them, and disclos'd the Mystery: Fy Sir said they, a Chiftain should beware, And not expose himself by half so far, To which he answer'd in a merry Mood, No Matter, since the Success has been good. But now said he let us consider soon, VVhat is the proper Thing next to be done. Since we are blest with such Deliv'rance great, From starving Hunger in our pinching Strait, And I from the deceitfull bloody Foe, Let's thank good Fate and to the Lowlands go. Mean Time pray little Boy, does thou know where, We'll get Provisions till we once come there. To which he meekly answered again, No Sir, untill we come to Rannach Plain. There with that Lord, great plenty you shall find, He serves King Edward, tho' against his Mind. Then I'll be Guide said Wallace to the Sheill. I know the Place my self exactly well. Thro' that wild Land he led them brave and right And to the Rannach brought them safe at Night. Where they the Watch did seize that was a Scot, On which account, they spar'd and kill'd him not Who told them the Condition of the Place, Which they commanded in a little Space. The Gate they won for Castle they had none, But a thick Mud-Wall, without Slime or Stone. Wallace in hast struck up the Chamber Door, Made it in Peices lye upon the Floor. Then all in fear from sleep start suddenly, The Lord gets up and does for Mercy cry. But when he knew that it was Wallace wight Most heartily he thank'd the GOD of Might. I was a true Man all my Life untill I vanquish'd was by Suthron, 'gainst my will. All Scots we are, that now before you stand, And ready to obey what you command. Since for this Land, such great Things you have done, What Scots Man dare hold his Face to the Sun. And yet resist you in so good a Cause, Defending of our Liberty and Laws: If any one be found that is so bad, I'm very sure, that Fellow's worse than Mad. Then all did promise with uplifted Hands, Most frankly to obey his just Commands And the more fully to confirm the Thing, Did swear Allegiance to their righteous King. Then merrily went all to Meat I trow, No wonder, for the Case was alter'd now, This Lord with mighty Pleasure also told, He had Three Sons all Valiant stout and bold; And Twenty of his own near Kins-Men more, As good as ever Sword or Target bore: Ready to serve him both with Heart and Hand, For the true Honour of their King and Land. To Heav'n then Wallace turning up his Eye, I Thank thee O my GOD for this Suply. Then did they pass the Day as seemed best, At Night set Watches and went all to Rest. But on the Morrow when the Day did peep, Wallace arose fully refresh'd with Sleep. And to the Fields took all his Men at length; To know what was his perfect real Strength. There did he muster all his little Force, And thanked GOD that Matters were not worse. Then to his Men he Champion-like did say, The Royal Banner let us now display. For under it most faithfully we'll fight, In the defence of brave old Scotland's Right. Our selves no longer we'll abscond and hide, Friends will flock to us now on every Side. They took such Horses as they there could find, Then to Dunkel march'd all with cheerfull Mind. The English Bishop to St. Johnstoun hasts, Wallace was none of his beloved Guests. The Scots soon took the Place and in a Word Put all the Suthron quickly to the Sword. On good Provisions then did nobly fare, Which the Lord Bishop for himself brought there. Silver and Gold, fine Jewels there they got, All that their Heart could wish they wanted not. Five Days rejoicing, merrily they spent, And on the Sixth VVallace to Council went. We have not Men enough, said he, you know Perth to invest, therefore we'll North-ward go. In Ross our Friends have made a Strength I'm told, Hear they of us they'll come like Warriours bold. Good Bishop Sinclar is in Bute also, Who when he hears the News, will not be slow. To come and take his Fate with cheerfull Heart, He never yet did fail to act his Part. The Westland Men when warn'd we'll get them all, I never yet did know them sit my call. For like brave Men, this Region they throughout, Have been with me, at many a bloody Bout. The Council then with one Voice did conclude, As he propos'd, for all was very good. They mount their Horses, march without delay, The Englishmen kep't all out of their Way. Those that possest the Strengths stay'd within Doors The Rest of them crep't close in Holes and Bores For all began to flee and scatter, from The very Time they heard he was come Home. Then with an Army strong the Scots at last. Most awfully thro' all the Kingdom past. Strengths were deserted by the Suthron then, And soon possessed by the Scotishmen. Who in good Order now as could be seen, Seven Thousand strong march all to Aberdeen. But frighted Suthron post away in haste, And leave the Town all desolate and waste. In all the Land left nothing more or less, Lord Bewmont took the Sea at Buchanness, Clement the Knight of Ross, appeared then, With a brave Company of Gallant Men. Took in the House of Nairn, with that brave Core, The Suthron Captain slew and many more- From Buchan, and from Murray came annon, Numbers of Scots, in quest of Bewmont gone. Who missing him, to Wallace march on Sight, Mongst whom was Sir John Ramsay that brave Knight. Whom when he saw, with many others there, That long ago his bold Companions were: How pleas'd he was I scarcely can descrive, But thought himself the happyest Man alive. Thus he the Northern parts recover'd, and Made good Men Judges over all that Land. When this was done, that no Time might be lost; March'd to St. Johnstoun straight with all his Host. CHAP. V. The Sige of St. JOHNSTOUN. Wallace the Town does here besiege in short, And keeps a sturdy Guard, at ev'ry Port. Where Bishop Sinclar came to him on Sight, With cliver Lads from Bute all young and tight. Lindsay, and Boyd, who did him ne'er beguile, From Arran came and from the Rauchly Isle, As did the Barron bold of great Renown, Brave Adam Wallace, then of Richartoun. In all the Road no Enemy durst be, Some fled away by Land and some by Sea. Seaton, and Lauder, and good Lundie now, Came in a Barge, to his Assistance too. And in the Haven did their Anchors cast, Where they Two English Ships secured fast. The one they burnt, the other loadned well, With Warlike stores and sturdy Men in Steel. To watch the Port, they strictly were oblig'd, That Men nor Victuals, pass to the besieg'd. From South, to North, the flying Suthron mourn, Some left their Lives, in Pledge they would return. The Suthron Bishop that fled from Dunkel, To London rode and told all that befel. Edward he sends for Aymer Vallange now, And asks at him what he thought best to do. Who like a Traitor answered, and said, Doubtless he by a Friend must be betray'd: Or by some of his Bone-Companions sold, Who have best liking to the English Gold. For which I shall my self to Scotland go, And try the Treason, whither Yea or No. King Edward therefore sign'd to him a Band. That he would ratify and and firmly stand, To whatsoever Bargain he would make, This Vallange does the Treason undertake, To Scotland comes, at Bothwel did arrive To execute the Plot he did contrive. Unto Sir John Monteith, express did send, To come and speak with him at Rutherglen. Who when he came, disclosed all his Mind. And laid before Sir John the whole Design. I know said he that you no Stranger are, Unto the News of this new bloody War. Which, if it be not soon put to a Stand, Will prove destructive to our native Land. Nothing but Blood and Rapine, we can see, Which will our great Misfortoune always be. So long as Wallace lives, who late and air, Insults King Edward boldly every where. The Country thus harrass'd on every Hand, There's neither Trade, nor Culture in our Land. Now good Sir John, if you'll advised be, To take a Wholsome Counsel once from me. It's in your Power to be an Earl now, And to do service to your Country too. I know you are for certain one of those, In whom Sir William Wallace does repose. Great Trust and Confidence in each respect, O would you then but grip him by the Neck. As Lords and Earls we might live and reign, Under King Edward our most gracious King. Fy said Monteith, it were a mighty Shame, Yea, you, and I, shall both be much to blame, If we betray a Man, who late and soon, To King and Country hath such service done. He's of our Nation, and our Forces all, Both Governour, and Captain General. For my part I declare, come Well or Wo, I'll never condescend to treat him so. Vallange reply'd if you but understood, How great a shedder he's of Christian Blood. You would not plead for him so much I'm sure, But rather contribute to break his Pow'r. Besides the King could he but end the Strife, Has no Design to take away his Life, But to confine him so as make him cease, From War and not disturb the Common Peace. This put Monteith unto a little stand, Who wish'd that Wallace were in Edward's Hand Providing always he his Life would spare, And make all good that Vallange promis'd there. When Vallange saw Monteith, thus in a muse, Most cunningly his little Time did use, Then in a Moment down he quickly told, Three Thousand Pound of finest English Gold. This you shall have, and Lennox at your Will, If you the King's desire will now fulfill. Then he who was brave Wallace Friend before, The strong Temptation could resist no more, But did resign his Honour, and himself, To Act the Treason, for the love of Pelf. Receiv'd the Gold and then was strictly bound, To carry Wallace safe to English Gound. And there to put him in the Suthron's Hand; For which he should be Lord of Lennox Land. This Vallange promis'd to him without fail, Sign'd and confirm'd it with King Edward's Seal. Thus part the Villains, Wallace Mortal Foes, And Aymer Vallange straight to London goes. The cursed Tydings he did quickly bring, Of his good Success to the English King. The Contract shows, told every Thing that past And did obtain his gracious Thanks at last, Which Melancholy Story makes me mourn, But to St. Johnstoun Siege I now return. Where Wallace lay besieging all that Time, Not dreaming of the Treasonable Crime Mean Time Five Hundred Suthron bold and stout, Early one Morning briskly sally out. At the South Port, against Dundass and Scot. Where they got a Reception mighty hot. The English fought it for a While, but then, Retir'd with no less Loss, then Fourscore Men. Yet tho' they were at that Time soundly beat, They took the Knight Dundass in the Retreat. Presented him before the Earl York, Which put an End unto that Morning's Work. The Knight Dundass nothing at all did find, But what was Civil, and exceeding kind. The Earl York so Mercifull was he, Most gen'rously dismiss'd and set him free. For which the grateful Wallace by and by Return'd him hearty Thanks most Courteously. Assuring him upon his Honour, that, He would his kindness soon retaliat. The Earl now of Fife, who had a Truce, With Edward, but an honest Heart to Bruce, Perceiving Wallace like a faithfull Leige, To carry on the War, came to the Siege. With him John Vallange who was Sherriff then, Of Fife, and a brave Train of goodly Men. Into the Ditch Faggots put very fast, Around the Stakes, Heather and Hay, they cast. With Trees and Earth, they made a Passage clear, Then o'er the Walls do march quite void of Fear The Suthron they, briskly resist again, While at the Wall a Thousand Men were slain. Couragiously, Wallace his Men leads on, And hew'd down all before him every Bone. Of Suthron Foes did dreadful havock make, But sav'd the Earl for Dundass's Sake. In Wax a Lyon on his Cloak did set, As a safe Conduct when with Scots he met. Gold in Abundance there he told him down, And safely caus'd convoy him out of Town. Women and Children freely he let pass, As still before his gen'rous Custom was. Then all the Country liv'd in peace and rest, And with true Scots the Town was re-possest. Thus having vanquish'd his proud Suthron Foes, With cheerfull Heart straight to the South he goes. Edward the Bruce, who had in Ireland been The Year before, is now in Scotland seen. With Fifty of his Mother's noble Kin, Attacks Kircudbright boldly enters in. And with those Fifty, for he had no more, Most gallantly he vanquished Nine Score. To Wigtoun next he and his Men are gone; The Castle took, for it was left alone. Where Wallace and his Men did not neglect, To meet him with all humble due Respect. Unto Lochmabane then most chearfully; Marched that brave, and gallant Company. Where Wallace like a true and faithfull Scot, Resign'd Command to Edward and why not. And promis'd that if Robert Bruce the King, Did not come Home in Person for to reign, He should in that Case certainly and soon, Have the Imperial ancient Scotish Crown. Prince Edward in Lochmabane tarry'd still, And Wallace went to Cumnock with good will. Then with his Friends he met at the Black Bog. And with them drank a blyth and hearty Cog. Unto King Edward News came reeking hot, Of all the Victories that Wallace got, And how he Scotland did again reduce, And that he had received Edward Bruce. The English Commons deeply swore and said, That Scotland they would never more invade. For that it was great Madness to go there, If the Scots Champion Wallace living were. Then to Monteith Edward wrote privily, Told him the Time was now fast passing by. Dispatch said he the Thing you took in Hand, For which ye have my Gold and I your Band. The false Monteith read o'er the Letter all, And then in haste his Sister's Son did call. To whom the Plot he did discover all, And made him swear he would it not reveal. On Wallace wait, said he, and frankly tell, You would with him as a Domestick dwell. Which if he grants, you must be very sure, To watch him nicely and the very Hour When all alone securely taking rest, Give me a call, and then I'll do my best. The Villain promis'd that it should be done, Then gets himself in Wallace Service soon. But the brave Wallace never had a Thought, Of what the false Monteith against him wrought, And he who now had Scotland Thrice set free. Nothing design'd but lasting Peace to be. For much fatigu'd with a long tedious War. He thought it more Eligible by far, To serve GOD and his King in his old Days, That he in Heaven, might sing eternal Praise. CHAP. VI. How WALLACE was betray'd by Sir. John Monteith, carry'd to England and martyr'd there That Wallace Foes might him no more traduce, Jop quickly is dispatch'd away to Bruce. Most earnestly beseeching he'd come down, To Scotland, and receive the ancient Crown. Since there was none that now durst him oppose, Having subdued all his Suthron Foes. When Jop's Credentials Bruce had fully read, His Heart exulted, and was mighty glad. With his own Hand he back to Wallace wrote, And thank'd the Hero for a Loyal Scot. Intreating him the Matter to conceal. And quickly he would out of England steal, To meet me then said Bruce be very sure, The first of July next on Glasgow Moor. And let your Company be very few, For I shall have but a small Retinue. Which when good Wallace read, blyth was his Thought, And all his Houshold then to Glasgow brought. That Month he ordered them there to abide. Keirly he took each Night with him to ride. And the young Man that false Monteith had sent, None but those Two knew what Way Wallace went. The vile young Villain, on the Eighteenth Night, Warned Monteith, who Sixty Men on Sight Caus'd mount, that were his own near Kins-men born, And deeply all unto the Treason sworn. Who from Dumbartan march, fy on them fy, And near to Glasgow Church come privily. A cunning Spy out as a Watch they sent, To notice and observe where Wallace went. Robreston it was near to the Way Side, And but on House where he used to bide. There walk'd on Foot till Midnight it was past, Keirly and he lay down to sleep at last. Charg'd the young Rogue, from whom no Harm he fear'd, To waken him if any Man appear'd But as he soundly slept the Traitor bold, His Uncle met and like a Villain told. That now it was the only Golden Time, For him to perpetrat the wicked Crime. Then all the cursed vile Barbarian Crew, Surround the House and honest Keirly slew The ruffian Servant he to work does fall, Steals Wallace Sword, his Dagger, Bow and all. To bind him then with Cords the bab'rous Byke, Surround the Hero, but he Sampson like, Got to his Feet, finding no other Tool, Broke one Rogues Back with a strong wooden Stool, And at a Second Blow, with little Pains, Beat out another fouty Rascal's Brains, As many as upon him Hands could lay, By force do think to carry him away On Foot alive; but that prov'd all in vain, He on the Spot chus'd rather to be slain, At which the false Monteith, his Silence broke, And subtily thus unto Wallace spoke. So long you have continued here alone, That Notice is unto the Suthron gone. Who have beset this House all round about, That by no means at all you can get out. With the Lord Clifford, who doth here command, And with his Party, at the Door doth stand, I spoken have, who promises your Life, Shall be most safe, if you'll give o'er your Strife: That to Dunbartan you shall with me pass, And be as fafe at Home as e'er you was You likewise see that we no Weapons have, We came in mighty haste your Life to save. Wallace believing he would do no wrong, To him, who had his Gossip been so long, Made the Monteith to swear he would fulfill What he had promis'd, then came in his Will. As Prisoner the Suthron must you see, Or else by Force they'll take you Sir from me, Said false Montieth; then slily on his Hands, They slipped cunning and most cruel Bands. Which underneath with sicker Cords they drew, Alas the Bruce that binding sore may rue. For Scotland's Ruin quickly came about, Occasion'd by the loss of Wallace stout. Who when led out little or nothing said, But missing Kierly knew he was betray'd. Then was he carry'd South o'er Solway Sands And left in Vallange and Lord Clifford's Hands. To Carlile Prison with him they do scour, Which to this Day is called Wallace Tow'r Some Writers please to say, but that's not sound, That Wallace martyr'd was in Berwick Town. That could not be I'm very sure for then, It was possest by brave bold Scottish Men. For which the Traitors went not by the Merse, Nor durst they march thro' Berwick for their Arse. Scotland, alas to whom wilt thou Complain! From Tears alas how can thou now refrain! Since thy best Help is falsly brought to Ground, And Chiftain bold in cruel Fetters bound. O who will thee defend in thy true Right, Or like brave Wallace ever shine so bright Thy Grief and Anguish now approacheth fast, Thou shalt in Sorrow soon be left at last. Thy General, and noble Governour: Is too too nigh his last and fatal Hour. Who shall defend thee now and make thee free Alas in War who shall thy Leader be. Who shall rescue thee now from Saxon Rage, And who their Wrath and Fury can asswage. I say no more, but beg GOD of his Grace, May thee in hast restore to wealth and Peace Brave Wallace now shall thee govern no more Who to thy Rights restor'd thee Thrice before. Mongst Wallace Men, at Glasgow where they lay, Great Sorrow was, when they found him away. Unto Lochmabane, Longoveil did pass, In mighty haste where good Prince Edward was. Where he in greatest Grief, and Sorrow swore, He never would depart from Scotland more, Nor yet his Native Land of France would see, On Wallace Foes till he aveng'd should be. Thus did that Knight in Scotland still remain, Untill the Bruce returned Home again. Was with the King when he St. Johnstoun took, The Second Man that enter'd, says the Book. With Chartris Lands was gifted by the King, From whom the Chartris ever since do spring. Robert the Bruce came Home on the Third Day, To Scotland after Wallace was away. And at Lochmabane with good Edward met, Where he the News of Wallace soon did get. At which was so exceeding griev'd and sad, He almost lost his Wits, was next to mad. Hold Brother, Edward said, by all that's good, If we him lose, we shall revenge his Blood. It's for your Cause, he's now to England led, In your Defence Scotland he Thrice hath fre'd. And had he not a faithfull Subject been, The ancient Kingdom we had never seen. Remember when he offer'd was the Crown, How he refus'd, and knock't the Project down. And now the Traitor that him basely sold, From you he thinks Dunbartan Fort to hold. Unto Dalsuintoun Edward order'd was, With Men in Arms next Day in haste to pass. And if he chanc'd to find the Cummine there, That by no Means his Life he then should spare. Finding him not, they all return in Peace, The King thereafter kill'd him in Drumfreiss. How that was done is needless to be shown, Since perfectly to every Man it's known. First to the King came Douglas that brave Knight, In all his Wars who worthy was and wight, Nor need I tell how Bruce did take the Crown, And how Lord Soulis deliver'd Berwick Town, Galloway lost, How John of Lorn arose Against the King with many other Foes. How Brechin bold, against the King did ride, With whom few honest Scotsmen did abide. And how the North was given from the King, Which made him long in painfull War to reign. But Douglas still his Loyalty did shew, And to the King was stedfast firm, and true. A better Chiftain Bruce had never one, Save Wallace who's without Commparison. Yet of the Douglas, more good Knights have been, Than in one House, was e'er in Scotland seen. As Bruce's Book doth plainly testify, By Mr. Barbour written faithfully. With Cliffard now Wallace to London goes, A Prisoner among his Mortal Foes. Then in a Prison strong clap't up was he, Whose dismal Hour King Edward long'd to see. The following Story savouring of the superstitious Credulity of the People and deceitfull Cousenage of the Monks of these Times, we have notwithstanding insert, lest we should seem at our own Hands rashly to ommit any Thing that we found in our Copy; to the End we may be admonished to study Thankfullness to GOD, who hath now open'd our Eyes to see thro' the Mist wherewith these former Ages were blinded. A Monk there was in Burie Abbay then, The most Religous of that Sect of Men. Another there of the same Order stood, That knew his Life, Chast, Innocent and good. The younger Monk, to know hid secrets fond, Of the old Father did obtain a Bond. That after Death he would return and tell, What Things he knew concrning Heaven and Hell. Whose Sp'rit removing from the World vain, Did at the Time appointed come again To the young curious Monk, in Figure bright, Fully resembling that of Lanthern light. A Fire Brand he in his Fore-Head bore, Which did surprize the Monk, and fright him sore Then said a Voice, GOD hath me granted Grace, To keep the Promise I made in this Place, Where art thou now, I thee Conjure to tell Said the young Monk, whether in Heaven, or Hell. In Purgatory said the Spirit where. I must remain for half a Year and mair. And after that shall have a Passage even, That will Conduct, and lead me save to Heaven. Yet unto thee I freely must declare, Two yet alive shall be before me there. The first of these if you would know him then, Hath in his Life kill'd a great deal of Men. Yet shall a Martyr dy on Wednesday next, Which for that Purpose is the Day prefix't. I fear he shall not have so good a Fate. Said the young Monk, for GOD doth Slaughter hate. It's VVallace said the Sp'rit pray understand, That took a Just, and Righteous War in Hand: For his own Country, 'gainst a cruel Foe. Therefore to Heav'n he certainly must go. Next a poor Priest to be commended much, Who's Gratitude, and Thankfullness was such, That tho' his Livings were but small, and mean. Was satisfi'd and never did complain. He certainly before me must also, Unto the holy Heavenly Mansions go. I am the Third by the Almighty's Grace, Brother he said, shall go unto that Place. At which Relation, said the curious Monk, Tell I this Story Folks will call me drunk. And tell me that I either Dream or Rave, Then said the Sp'rit this Witness thou shall have. The Bells shall ring in spite of earthly Pow'r, That Day he's kill'd, the space of half an Hour. Which came to pass a Thing both strange and odd, Was publish'd, and believ'd, thro' Britain broad. The Sp'rit departed and the Monk went Home, But I proceed to Wallace Martyrdom. Who by the armed Souldiers from his Bed, Upon the fatal Wednesday sorth was led. To be a Victim to the Southron's Rage, Since nothing less their Fury could asswage. Where meekly he casting his Eyes about, Did for a Priest Religiously call out. Which Edward did refuse, and with next Breath. Discharg'd his Clergy all on pain of Death. The Bishop then of Canterbury, broke Out in a holy Passion and thus spoke. Here I protest against such Wickedness, In spite of thee O King I'll him Confess. And if thro' Force thou stop me from this Thing, I vow to GOD my righteous Heav'nly King. O'er England all I shall thee Interdict, And make it known thou art a Heritick. The holy Sacrament I shall him give, Then take thy choice to starve or let me live. It were more Honour for thy Crown I say, To Save his Life then thus to take't away Thou all thy Life hast rung in sinfull Deed, As shall be seen on thee or on thy Seed. At which the King inrag'd commands to seize, The holy Bishop, nothing else would please. His Lords intreated he might not do so, But for the Churches sake would let him go. Each good Man thought the Bishop in the Right, Who gravely walk'd to Wallace upon Sight. Heard his Confession all unto the End, And humbly did his Sp'rit to GOD commend. Then took his leave, no longer did abide, But to Westminster straight away did ride. Thirty long Days poor Wallace cruelly They bound and never did his Hands unty. Then with a Chain unto an Oaken Stake, Most barb'rously did fast the Victim make. Next sent a Clerk to hear what he would say. O fatal, cruel, bloody Wednesday. Thou Scot said he, that so great wrong hast done, Thou sees thy fatal Hour approacheth soon, Thou should to Mind recal thy wretched Deeds. And seriously once more tell o'er thy Beads. For now perforce, thou here must quickly dy, To whom the noble Martyr did reply; You do not know, whither I've done amiss, Yon worthy Bishop hath me promis'd Bliss. Thy Rancor, Malice, and thy cruel Spite, Shall ne'er my Courage, nor my Conscience smite My Comfort is to know the VVay I go, My Trouble, that, I'm here so long below. Then said the Clerk, I wonder at thy skill, Who might have had all Scotland at thy will Providing that thou would thy Arms lay down And hold that Kingdom of the English Crown, Wallace reply'd, thou speaks a foolish Thing, Had I got Home my own true righteous King, Cold Death I should embrac'd, grievous, and grim, Or else have made all England hold of him. Intirely then it should been in his Will, What honest Men to save, what Rogues to kill. Well said the Clerk, I see thou wilt not grieve, For thy great Sins so long as thou dost live. Thou'st kill'd more Men than any in thy Time, And yet repents not of that bloody Crime. Methinks thou should confess each sinfull Thing. And offer yet thy Service to our King. At which the noble Champion Wallace smil'd, And told the Clerk that he was all beguil'd. I have I grant of Suthron slain a few, But not the half of what I wish'd, I vow. I mov'd no War, but to regain our own, As unto GOD and all the World's known. Therefore thy babling hold let me alone, I in GOD's Name command thee to be gone. At which a Sheriff, who did there attend, The foolish railing Clark away did send. Wallace about him from his Child-hood kept, Where e'er he went whither he walk'd or slept. A Psalter Book, which he beseech'd the Knight, Lord Clifford, might be brought into his Sight. Which done, he caus'd a Priest upon the Place. To hold it open streight before his Face, On which he look'd, sometimes his Eyes up cast, Religiously unto his very last. Then quickly came the Executioner who, Gave him the fatal, and the Mortal blow. This in Defence (that Hero ends his Days) Of Scotland's Right, to his immortal Praise. Who's valiant Acts, were all recorded fair, Written in Latin by the famous Blair. Who at that Time, the Champion did attend, Was an Eye-Witness and his Chaplain then. And after that as History does tell Confirm'd by Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkel. FINIS. The Author of the History of the DOUGLASSES hath translated the foresaid Verses thus. Envious Death who ruins all, Hath wrought the sad lamented Fall. Of Wallace, and no more remains Of him, then what an Urn contains, We Ashes for our Hero have, He for his Armour a cold Grave; He left the Earth too low a State, And by his Acts o'ercame his Fate. His Soul Death had not Power to kill, His noble Deeds the World fill, With lasting Trophies of his Name. O! hadst thou Vertue lov'd or Fame, Thou cou'dst not have insulted so Over a Brave, betrayed Foe, Edward, nor seen these Limbs expos'd, To publick Shame, fit to be clos'd As Relicks in an holy Shrine, But now the Infamy is thine, His End Crowns him with glorious Bays And stains the Brightest of thy Praise. FINIS.</field>
