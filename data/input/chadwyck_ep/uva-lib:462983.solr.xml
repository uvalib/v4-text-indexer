      <field name="fulltext">Vpon euery letter of our Soueraignes Heyre-apparant, his most honorable Stile. (Viz:) Henry, Prince of VVales. High heyre apparant to our supreame King, Eternall God enrich thee with his grace, Now in thy Prime of age, with vertues spring, Resplendant still to shine, and grow apace, Young years shall then, (with honors high renown) Prince Henries fame imblazon in each towne. Regard each day, to worship God aright, In all attempts, set him him before thine eyes, No danger then, Thy person shall afright, Christ Iesus euermore will send supplyes. Extoll his prayses then with heart and voyce, O Noble Prince, make him thy cheefe of choyce. Forsake all by waies, leading vnto vyce, VVith such as learning loue, alwaies consort, Abhore them most, to leudnesse that entyce, Let no such Roysters once with thee make sport. Esteeme them best. That most in vertue shine, So shall Gods loue increase, to thee and thine. The Author to the Reader of this Booke. 1 I do not seeke to feede their fickle braine, In filed phraze, that set there sole delight, Nor how to descant braue on things most vaine, Mens minds to leudnesse thereby to excite. Because the time so spent, is lost (or worse) And brings repentance, (if no greater curse.) 2 But: He that would be glad to heare and know, The three estates of mankind in this life, VVhat loue to his, the Lord doth alwaies show, And how the Deuill doth sow debate and strife. The former still dehorting all from sin, The latter, luring to delight therein. 3 And how Mans state vnstable here doth stand, Subiect to sundry hard conditions, And still how God vpholds vs with his hand, From all extreames in our tentations, If thou desire to find release in neede, Marke what is writ, The better shalt thou speed. 4 If any aske, whie such graue points of skill, Are put in verse (which should in prose remaine) Tell them againe, it standeth with Gods will, Both means to vse, To make the same more plain. As Dauids Psalmes, and Saloms songs declare, Which, (for our learning) safe recorded are. The goodnesse of God towards all Mankind, manifold wayes. The First Point. In Creating all thinges for our vse, and vs for his glory. 1 O Glorious God, how much is Man, For euer bound to praise thy Name, Genesis Chap. 1. No mortall wight can rightly scan, As all thy workes expresse the same. 2 If man looke vp with fixed eyes, How wonderfully doth appeare, Thy workmanship in azure skyes, With all thy creatures planted there. Gene. 1. 3 The Sunne and Moone aboue the rest, To guide and rule each day and night, With glistering Starres all ready prest, To pleasure vs by shining bright. 4 The Clouds that hang aboue our heads, (As times and seasons do require) Their fruitfull shewers abroad do spread, Gene. 1. To satisfie our hartes desire. 5 If Man cast downe his eyes below, Gen. 1.To view Gods Creatures heare on earth, How do they all his loue foreshew, Still to preserue Mans vitall breath. 6 The Foules that flye in firmament, Gen. 1.And all kind Fishes in the Sea, To take and vse, for his content, With Beastes on th'earth to rule alway. 7 And, for mans meat, God did prouide, Gen. 1.All fruitefull trees (saue onely one) With euery Hearb that beareth seed, For man all times to feede vpon. 8 A pleasant place cald Parradice, Gen. 2.God planted mankind first therein, To haue all times what hart could wish, So long as he auoyded sinne. 9 And that man might liue in this state, And neuer dye (vnlesse he would) Gen. 2.The tree of life, thereon to eate, God planted in that sacred mould. 10 How truely then, might mankind say, Psal. 8.How much are we (Lord) bound to thee, For all thy fauours euery way, Inlarged so aboundantly. 11 Much more. If thou lift vp thy mind, Gods loue to man. To meditate Gods loue to thee, A thousand fould thou shalt it finde, Exceeding others in degree. 12 For, In creating all things else, Gen. 1. God onely said, (Let it be so?) And so they were, (as Scripture tels) His mighty power, (by word to shoe.) 13 But, In creating Man, God said, Gen. 1. 26 Let vs make Man: where by we see, His perfect person to be made, Euen by the blessed Trinity. 14 Which proueth, man did farre excell, Gen. 1. 26 27. All former workes, it is most plaine: As that which followes (marke it well) In our owne Image doth containe. 15 For (by Gods Image) in this place, Gen. 2. 20 Col. 3. 10 Is meant these speciall qualities, (His Knowledge, Truth, and Holinesse) All which in Man, were pure likewise. 16 For Knowledge, Adam first did name, Eph. 4. 24. (All liuing Creatures in their kind) His Life also, was without blame, And all the graces of his minde. 17 So that in these was no dissent, Gen 3Twixt God and Man, (for gifts most cleare) Saue (all in God, were permanent) But man might change, (as did appeare) 18 Behold Gods loue to man, yet more, Mans prerog. Gene. 1.In placing him the supreame Lord, Of all his Creatures made before, To guide and gouerne by his word. 19 And that, which most did shew Gods loue, There was but one excepted Tree, Which he forbad that man should proue, Gen. 2.On paine of death eternally. 20 VVhat could God, more haue done for man, Or, how much is man to him bound, Psal. 8No earthly wight can rightly scan, Then be not slacke, his praise to sound. The Second Point, Describing the malice of Sathan towardes Mankind, in ouerthrowing their happy estate in Parradise. 1 Sathans malice. 1 Pet. 5 Sathan the Deuill, our deadly foe, (Enuying our first happinesse) Did forthwith seeke to breede our woe, And bring vs into wretchednesse. 2 VVho, knowing Adam and his wife, To be most wise (of Creatures) He chose the next, to worke their strife, Gen. 3 And so the Serpent, he allures. 3 Directing him, first to beginne, (VVith Eue, the weaker, as he knew) And (if he could) to make her sinne, Gen. 3 That afterwardes they both might rew. 4 The Serpent then, (vpon her speech) (They might not eate of euery Tree) Did seeke there by to ouerreach Gene. 3. Her vnconstant simplicity. 5 And thereupon, He answered, Hath God forbidden to eate of all, (As who should say be not afraid) Genesis 3 Small signe of loue, you may it call. 6 The woman heareunto replyes, Genesis 3 For then ye shall dye. God giues vs both free liberty, To eate all fruit before our eyes, (Saue onely one) Least then we dye. 7 And heare behold, her weakenesse great, Gen. 2, 17 In soule. To doubt of that, (which God said plaine) At what time thereon ye shall eate, (Ye shall not doubt) but dead remaine. 8 The Serpent seeing her made doubt, To eate thereof for feare of death, Genesis 3Doth answer (like a Champion stoute) (You shall not dye) feare not his breath. 9 For, Well God knowes, the very day, That you shall eate thereon your fill, Genesis 3You shall be like to him alway, In knowledge of both good and euill. 10 The woman then distrusting God, And trusting Serpents subtiltyes, Genesis 3Did yeeld to eate the fruit forbad, (In hope his words would proue no lyes.) 11 But, That she should soone reape thereby, Both honor, profit, and pleasure, Genesis 3And hauing tast thereof, did bye, Her Husband likewise to allure. 12 Genesis 3VVho, (by her smooth and flattering tongue) Did eate thereof, with her also, And thereby did himselfe great wrong, To wrap them both in endlesse woe. 13 Whereby, they lose that Image pure, Genesis 3In which God did them first create, Both them, and theirs, still to incure, Most extreame thrall, and cursed state. [Mankinds lamentation] Mankinds lamentation, Of their miserable condition, By naturall corruption, Through Adams inclination, Vnto his wiues perswasion, By Serpents first suggestion, Through Sathans instigation. 1 All Adams heyres in him once blest, (Before his fearefull fall by sin) But since, accursed with the rest, To waile our woes, let vs beginne, Through Serpents first suggestion, The foote. And mankinds first presumption. 2 Once, were our soules the Image pure Of Gods eternall maiesty, Gen. 1 &amp; 2. Now, are they filthy and obscure, Like Sathan, in all villanie. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 3 Once, was our wit and will most cleare, To know, and do the will of God, Now, are they voyde of all such care, And after sin, do range abroad. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 4 Once, was our hart, sincere and sound, In loue, ioy, zeale, and constantnesse, Genesis 6Now, are they quite contrary found, Full fraught, with all deceitfulnesse. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 5 Once were we holy, iust, and right, Rom. 7.In life, and in Religion, Now are we stript of all such might, Prophane of disposition. Through Serpents. &amp;c. 6 Once, were our bodies rightly cald, The Temples of the Holy ghost, Now are we all by sinne inthrald, VVith sundry kinds of Sathans host. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 7 Once, were our members ready prest, All times to please the liuing Lord, Now are they all, with sinne possest, And follow it with one accord. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 8 Once, were our soules and bodies both, Planted in pleasant Parradise, Now banish thence, (though most vnloath,) To liue in toyle and miseries. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 9 Once, had we health, and harts desire, Exempted from all kinds of woe, Leuit. 26 Deu. 28. Now are we forst, (as wood in fire) All maladies to vndergoe. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 10 Once, were we all Gods Seruants free, To liue with him in blessednesse, Of our selues. Now, are we bound, (by death) to lye, In hellish paine, without release. Through Serpents, &amp;c. 11 Through Serpent chiefely, was the meanes, (To wrap vs in this wretchednesse) And Woman next (in hope of gaines) By yeelding vnto wickednesse. Yet Adams fact was worthy blame, In trusting of his lying dame. 12 Thus; Sathan, Father of all lyes, Ioh. 8. 44 Abusd the Serpents tongue to lye, And he, the womans tongue likewise, And she her Husband craftily, Thus by their lies, and trust therein, All were accursed for that sinne. Whether (by the workes of the Law) any of Adams heyres may be restored into Gods fauour. 1 Some Men suppose, that though mans fall Did bring his of spring into paine, ObiectionYet God his Law gaue vnto all, To reconcile mankind againe. 2 Else they alledge, it must needes check, God of Iniustice, sundry waies, To giue a Law for to correct, Mans sinfull courses all his dayes. 3 And yet to grant no grace at all, For mortall Man to keepe the same, But, to condemne both great and small, That liue not well, without all blame. 4 AnsweredI Will thus answere (by demaund) What maister will they charge with wrong, For asking stocke at Seruants hand, That doth vnto himselfe belong. 5 Or, if the Seruant wast the same, In pride and prodigality, Will any man the maister blame, To pack him, for his trechery, Answered 6 Euen so it stands, twixt God and vs, (When he requires obedience) For want thereof, he may vs cursse, And yet none charge him with offence. 7 Because, when first God gaue his law, It was then graft in mans nature, &amp;c. (Whilst mankind was in Paradise) He made them able for to show, Obedience due in perfect wise. 8 Now, seeing Adam and his seede, Haue broke the bonds that once God made, Shall not he iustifie his deede, To see the forfaytures be paid. 9 Then will they last of all demaund, (If Gods Law do not iustifie) Why did he Moses then commaund, Obiection (To write it for posterity.) 10 I answer, with the Apostle Paule, Answere. Gal. 2. If Gods Law any man could saue, Then Christ his death was vaine (for all,) For Sauiours two, we neede not haue. 11 And yet no want in Gods law found. No default in the law.For why? It is his holy will) But sinne, mans nature hath so bound, That we cannot the same fulfill. 12 So that; none can Gods Law accuse, To be vniust, or sent in vaine, Seuerall vses in the law.For why? It serueth to good vse, As these effects do well explaine. 13 Vse 1The first: It lets vs see the state Of our created holinesse, That we thereon might contemplate, VVith praise to God, for his kindnesse. 14 Vse 2The second: It doth let vs see, Our wofull state (by Adams fall) That we to Christ, for helpe might flee, To saue our soules from endlesse thrall. 15 Vse 3The third: It lets vs see our sins, And Gods iust iudgement for the same, That we might all auoyd those grins, And so to keepe our soules from shame. 16 Vse 4The fourth: It lets vs see the way, How we should walke to please the Lord, That for his grace, we still might pray: To liue according to his word. How Gods Iustice and mercy ioyne both together in mankinds restoration. 1 Almighty God, beholding Man, Depryued of his blessednesse,) To looke with visage pale and wan, (By reason of his wretchednesse.) 2 And knowing him in least default, No Tempter (as the others were) But sore abusd (by their assault) And vtter spoyld (as did appeare.) 3 Then, In his great compassion, Of mankinds extreame misery, God entred consultation, Their rewfull state to remedy, 4 That, Where their sins deserued death, (Euen by iust doome for euermore) Mercy alone, (as Scripture saith) Could not mans happy state restore, 5 Vnlesse Gods Iustice therewithall, (By suffering death, were satisfied,) Then God to counsell did both call, And (by consent) hath thus decreed. 6 That: Where Mans nature did offeud, And so deserued for to dye, Mans nature, should that fault ameud And suffer death accordingly. 7 Hebr. 9.Yet so: (as he should ouercome) Both Death and Sathan, Prince of Hell, And so restore mankinds freedome, In euerlasting ioyes to dwell. 8 And, for that Angels were to weake, (To conquer these great enimies,) The Sonne of God did vndertake, This high most worthy enterprize. 9 Whereto, his Father gaue consent, He should descend from Heauen so high, On earth for to be resident, Till he had got the victory. 10 And to that end, it was his will, Of blessed Virgin to be borne, The holy Scripture to fulfill, And vs to helpe that were forlorne. 11 By his two natures vnited, Col. 2.(Both God and Man, one person pure) He might be alwaies furnished, Our former freedome to procure. 12 In Mans Nature (as capable, To vndergo all kind of paine) In Gods Nature, (as alwaies able) To help himselfe and vs againe. 13 First, with our nature to begin, (Where that was stayned in Gods sight,) Christ tooke our Nature (without sinne) Christes pure conception. Conceyued, (through Holy-ghost his might) 14 And of the Virgin Mary borne, (As Th'angel did fore-prophesie) Lu. 1. &amp; 2 A sauior. Else had all mankind beene forlorne, Without all hope of remedy. 15 And that all people then might know, He was of power to saue vs all, His very name, the same did show, Mat. 1. 21. Luk. 1, 30 36. As Th'angell (Iesus) did him call. 16 Likewise, (because he vndertooke, To be our Prophet, King, and Priest,) Heb. 9. 14 1 Iohn 2. 22. It is recorded in Gods Booke, That he was also called Christ. 17 Which is, (Annoynted of the Lord,) Anoynted. Psal. 45. 7 Hebr. 1. 9 To execute those offices, That (by his sauing worke and word) He might our freedome accomplish. 18 Thus, Iesus Christ, (He being borne) And growing vp to Mans degree, Doth thinke on vs, that were forlorne, In former state to set vs free. 19 For, Well he knew, our sinfull fall, Did spoyle vs all of blessednesse, Eph. 2. Col 3.And brought vs likewise to be thrall, To euerlasting cursednesse. 20 Because we neither could fulfill, The law of God, that leads to blisse, Nor beare his wrathfull vengeance still, Till we had quited his iustice. 21 Without both which, Christ knew right well, That we were left remedilesse, From euer scaping out of Hell, Or getting former happinesse. 22 Both which Christ did, in our Nature, Well vndertake for to supply, And so from time to time made sure, His Fathers wrath to pacifie. 23 For, whereas without righteousnesse, We could not come to blessed rest, Christ liu'd in vpright holinesse, (As in the Scripture is exprest.) 24 Not onely in auoyding, But euer doing good withall, His Fathers will for to fulfill, For vs (through sinne) still kept in thrall. 25 That so our nature full of sinne, Before Gods throne of grace in Christ, Might be presented pure in him, In whom our comfort doth consist. What Christ suffered in his body, for the sinnes of our bodies. 1 Immanuell Iesus Christ our Lord, Hauing fulfild his Fathers Law, Did likewise willingly accord, The penalty to vndergo. 2 That where we all deserued shame, In body and Soule eternally, He would needes suffer for the same, In both respects to set vs free, 3 His blessed body did beginne, To suffer griefe in euery part, Sore whipt and scourged for our sinne. Which needs must vex his inward hart. 4 His head was crowned with sharp Thornes, His eyes and eares, indured paine, His tongue with taunts the bad did scorne, Who still accursed do remaine. 5 His Armes, his Legges, his hands, his feete, Was nayled fast vpon the Tree, As sacrifice for sinne most meete, For our offences so to be. 6 His harmelesse side with pearcing speare, Was wounded deepely for our sake, From whence blood ran and water cleare, Our full attonement for to make. 7 And last of all, his guiltles death, Vpon the crosse, and put in graue, Shall sanctifie our mortall breath, Eternall rest with Christ to haue. 8 O blessed Iesus, King of Kings, How much is mankind bound to thee, We must confesse in all these things, And euer prayse thy maiesty. That Christ suffered in his Soule, for the sinnes of our Soules 1 If Saloman the wisest King, That euer raigned on this earth, Could not describe the fearefull sting, Of wounded conscience during breath. Pro. 18. 14 No mortall wight can then expresse, Of Christ his soule the pensiuenesse. The foote 2 Some sinne we see doth presse mans hart, So very sore each day by day, As causeth comfort to depart, And sorrow vexe them euery way. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 3 If wounded conscience for one sinne, Do bring some men to wofull thrall, As Iudas. What extreame torments was Christ in, Who bore that burden for vs all. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 4 We all confesse, (in whom is grace) Our sinfull soules, (by Gods iust doome) Deserue with Deuils to haue a place, In euerlasting woes to come. Ephe. 3 No mortall wight can then expresse, Of Christ his soule the pensiuenesse. 5 Sith then, our Soules do farre exceed, The bodies constitution, There sinne, the greater paine must breed, In horrible confusion. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 6 Gods Iustice then must needs impose, Most extreame paine, on Christ his Sonne, Sith, he would answer for all those, That rest on his compassion. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 7 How great those torments in Christes soule, Were felt of him, doth well appeare, Mat. 26 &amp; 27.In that his spirit they did controule, To vtter words, (as seem'd of feare.) No mortall wight, &amp;c. 8 What was the cause that made Christ say, (My soule is heauy vnto Death,) Luke. 22. verse 44.And for to sweat (as he did pray) That drops like bloud fell downe to th'earth: No mortall wight, &amp;c. 9 Yea, when his Father would not heare, What made him then so loud to cry, Mat. 27(My God, my God, O Father deere) Why hast thou thus forsaken me. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 10 It was not paine of body then, That made Christ Iesus thus complaine, But wrath of God, for sinnes of men, Which he in soule did then sustaine. No mortall wight, &amp;c. 12 Oh? Who will take delight to sinne, In soule or body night or day, Sith our sins past, on Christ did bring, So extreame torments euery way: No mortall wight, that can expresse, Of Christ his soule the pensiuenesse. Vpon the sufferings of our Sauiour Iesus, two questions discussed. 1 The former, Sith we all confesse, Our selues still sinners for to be, And that (as Scripture doth expresse) We ought to die eternally. 2 How comes it then to passe? declare, The first question: That Christ (for vs) got victory, And death with Diuels, all conquered are, So, as we scape their Tyrany. 3 The answer hereunto is plaine, (If we eonsider Death and Deuill, On whom, their power did remaine: Those that delight in sinne and euill. 4 For onely such, God gaue them leaue, To cut off, when their sins were ripe, And them (as Iaylors to receyue,). Of ioy and comfort, quite to stripe. 5 And in the roome thereof, for aye, (As their most iust deserued hyre,) To vexe their soules both night and day, In euerlasting hellish fire. 6 Now, whereas surther they made bold, To lay hands on the Innocent, So were they both to be contrould, (By Gods Iustice omnipotent.) 7 But, (by your leaue) will some reply, Did not Christ come, to saue vs all, Reply.And so to suffer willingly, To ransome vs, from endlesse thrall. 8 It is most true (we all confesse) In which respect, it may be saide, Repulsed.If Death, and Sathans craftinesse, Their heads together then hed layd. 9 To punish Christ (as one that would, Needes vndertake for others sins,) They could not then, haue beene contrould, For holding him, within their grins. 10 But sith they durst put him to death, (As guilty in his owne person) As a Blasphemer. Naturally For telling truth (as Scripture saith) He was of God (the onely Sonne) 11 Heerein (presuming without cause, (To punish Christ most Innocent,) He rid himselfe out of their clawes, (Through power Diuine) incontinent. 12 And rose againe out of the graue, (As iust tryumphing Conqueror) Our soules and bodies for to saue, From Sathans power for euermore. 13 For right and Iustice did agree, (According to Gods holy law) A tooth, for tooth, an eye, for eye, Exod. 21. 24. From guilty persons for to draw. 14 Then must it stand with Gods iust doome, (Sith Death and Sathan did conspyre) To do Iniustice to his sonne, Of Heauen and Earth the onely heyre.) 15 That they should forfeit all their right, (Which they on Sinners had before) To Iesus Christ, the Lord of might, (Euen whom he please, for to restore.) 16 By Iustice therefore, now we see, Reu. 3, 7 Mat. 28.Christ is both Lord, of life and death, To saue or spill eternally, As holy Writ concluded hath. 17 Col. 2.Thus see we Sathan, Death and Hell, Hebr. 2.(All Captiue now, to Christ our Lord: And that all his, with him shall dwell, To praise his name, with one accord. 18 The second question, standeth thus, 2 Questi?.(Sith we deserue eternall woe) How comes it then, that Christ Iesus, The same should fully vndergo? 19 And suffer but so small a space, His Fathers wrath to pacifie, And vs againe restore to grace, Gods iustice satisfied thereby. 20 The answer standeth on two parts, (And both of them performd in Christ) To cheare and comfort all our harts, And please our God in heauen the hyest. 21 The former is, (if we respect,) Col. 2Christs Godhead, ioynd with our nature, Then will it presently detect, That plaine, (which seeme before obscure.) 22 For Christ (By his Diuinity,) Could suffer more within one houre, (Assisting his humanity) Then we should suffer euermore. 23 The latter maketh it more plaine, Hos. 13, 14. When Christ (by death) had vanquisht death, What force in him could then remaine, 1 Cor. 15 Hebr. 3. To hold vs subiect to his wrath. 24 Methinkes I heare yet, some reply, If Death haue lost his force indeede, How comes it then, that all men dye, A Reply Repulsed. (According to our common Creede.) 25 I do reioynd, and still auow, Death hath no power to hurt at all, (But where our Christ doth him allow,) All such, as to his wrath are thrall. 26 As for Christs chosen Seruants deere, Death is their friend (against his will,) By ridding them of sorrowes heere, To liue in ioy and pleasure still. 27 Thus do we more and more behold, The loue of Christ our Sauiour, To Adams heyres, on earthly mould, That we might praise him euermore. 1 One doubt remaineth yet behynd, The last doubt.Dissolued for to be, Which dearest Saints of God, most finde, To vexe their soules daily. 2 That is, The sight of present sinnes, Whereby Gods wrath they moue, To hold them still in Sathans grins, (As banisht from his loue.) 3 Which makes them weepe both day and night, For grieuing him so sore, To shut them quite out of his sight, To see his face no more. 4 O ye the blessed of the Lord, Mat. 5,That thus do sigh and grone, Giue eare vnto his holy word, And cease to make your mone. 5 On whom doth God cast downe his eye, Esa. 66, 2 Psa, 51. 17But on the wounded hart, That for his mercies call and cry, To ease them of their smart. 6 Or whom doth Christ vnto him call, (But such as he opprest,) Ma, 11, 28That he (in time) might ease them all, And bring them to his rest. 7 What he hath said you must beleeue, (You can it not deny,) Oh then, do not his spirit grieue, But to his mercy flye. 8 You know Gods mercy (through his loue,) Sent downe his Sonne Iesus, Iohn. 3 You know Christes mercie did him moue, To become man for vs. 9 That in our nature he might pay The debt that we did owe, Iohn 10, And so his Fathers iustice stay, His mercy for to show. 10 To this end, when accurst we were, (By reason of our sinne) Christ Iesus then our cursse did beare, Deut. 21. 23. (When he on Tree did hang.) Gal. 3. 13 11 And that he might for euermore, From Vengeance set vs free, The wrath of God (on Crosse) he bore, Col. 2 That we migh: saued be. 12 And to that end, when he did rise, From death to life againe, And did assend in glorious wise, Act. 5 With troups of Angels traine. 13 Eph. 4, 8 Hebr. 3Then led he captiue all our foes, The Deuill, with all the rest, And reconcild to God all those, That are, or shall be blest. 14 Who sitteth now on Gods right hand, 1 Tim 2, 5Our aduocate to be, And doth our causes vnderstand, From foes to set vs free. 15 If sinne therefore, thy soule oppresse, Then sue to him for grace, Mat. 11. 28.And he will soone procure release, To ease thee in that case. 16 For why, (in him) the Father is Mat. 17 Iohn 17Well pleased for euermore, To giue all those eternall blisse, That do his name adore. A glimpse of that glory, which the redeemed shall haue with Christ in his kingdome. 1 Though eye may see, and tongue can tell The state of greatest Princes heere, And such as in their courts do dwell, Or chiefest rule and office beare. 2 Cor. 2, 9 The footeNo eye hath seene, no eare hath heard, No tongue of mortall man can tell, The high estate in heauen prepard, Wherein the Saints of God shall dwell. 2 No Princes Court, so stately heare, But mortall men the same did frame, 2 Cor. 5, 1 He. 11, 10 But, Heauenly pallace is so faire, As God (not man) did build the same. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 3 In Princes Court, no subiect may, Weare any Crown (saue Prince alone) In heauen, the Saintes of God alway, 2 Tim. 4, 8 Weare Crownes of glory euery one. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 4 In Princes Court, with Prince to sit, But few, so highly honored be, In Heauen all Saints Christ doth admit, Eph 3. 6. 2 Tim. 3. To sit and raigne with him daily. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 5 In Princes Courts, some loosely liue, And grieue the Godly day by day, In Heauen: None there offences giue, Reu. 21 Nor once can sin no kind of way. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 6 In Princes Courts, some men doe want (Though others haue enough and more, In Heauen, none there feele any scant, Reu. 21 &amp; 22. Nor any person can be poore. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 7 In Princes Courtes, some liue in paine, By sores and grieues of sundry kinds, Reu. 21In Heauen all men in health remaine, For nothing there can vexe their minds. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 8 In Princes Courts, some do lament, (By sundry kinds of casualities,) Reu, 7, 17In Heauen, their time in mirth is spent, (For teares are wyped from their eyes.) No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 9 In Princes Courts, some sing Gods praise, (But soone are weary of the same,) Re, 4, &amp; 5In Heauen they laud the Lord alwaies, And still reioyce to praise his name. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 10 In Princes Courts, whom Prince doth loue, May (by occasion) loathas sore, Reu. 7In Heauen; All there, in Christ aboue, Do liue and loue for euermore. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 11 In Princes Courts, though men should haue, What hart could thinke, it would decay, Reu. 21. &amp; 23.In Heauen such ioyes all there receaue Psal. 16As by no change, can weare away. No eye hath seene, &amp;c. 12 Thus may we see, by that is saide, How much we all are bound to Christ, When Princes Courts are but a shade, Compard with his, in Heauen the hyest. No eye hath seene, no eare hath heard, Nor tongue of mortall man can tell, The high estate in Heauen prepard, Wherein the Saints of God shall dwell. All professours shall not be inheritors of Christes kingdome (but true beleeuers onely.) 1 Though Christ his merits be of power, To saue mankind from Hell, And Adams heyres for to restore, With him in ioyes to dwell. 2 But few yet (in comparison,) Reape benefit thereby, The want thereof (not in Gods Son) But in themselues doth lye. 3 For (if all persons could beleeue,) Then all should saued be, For Christ to such his grace doth giue, Iohn 3. From Hell to set them free. 4 Striue then to shew the true effect, Lu. 13, 24 Iam. 2And fruits of liuely faith, Else Christ (as dead) wil thee reiect, (As holy Scripture saith.) 5 For why? The gate is very straite, That leadeth vnto blisse, Mat. 7, 13 14.And few do enter in there at, So hard to find it is. 6 Dost thou beleeue within thine hart, Christ dyed for thy sin? Then from the same thou must depart, 2 Tim, 2, 19.And come no more therein. 7 Dost thou beleeue Christ rose againe, Thy freedome to restore? Col. 3 Rom. 6.Then must thou holinesse retaine, To please him euermore. 8 The ioyes of Heauen they do belong, (To onely such indeede,) VVho do refraine from doing wrong, And follow right with speede. 9 But if thou dost delight in sinne, And after it still range, So that thou wilt not once beginne, Thy wicked waies to change. 10 It is most true, (as thou shalt find) Thy faith is dead and vaine, Iam. 2. And fearefull woes shall vex thy mind, In euerlasting paine. 11 Oh then, whilst God doth grant thee space, Cry hard both day and night, That he will giue to thee his grace, To lead thy life vpright. 12 Then shall thy workes, thy faith approue, To be aliue and sound, Iam. 2. Then art thou deere to God aboue, Reu. 2, 10 And shalt (in Christ) be crownd. [A feruent supplication] A feruent supplication, Tending to mortification, And new regeneration, That leadeth to saluation. 1 Most louing Lord, and Father deere, I humbly sue vnto thy grace, The sinners complaint. That thou (in Christ) my suite wilt heare, Which now I make before thy face. 2 And first whereas my sinfull soule, Hath much offended many waies, Of his soule. O Lord do thou her lusts controule, To liue according to thy lawes. 3 Of his hart My hart, the harbor of all sinne, That in my body doth remaine, Reforme a new, for to begin, From wickednesse for to refraine. 4 Of his thoughts.My thoughts that were Impure before, To range from sin to sin each day, O sanctify them more and more, To please thy goodnesse euery way. 5 Of his wit and will. My wit and will, withall the rest, Of inward guifts of soule and mind, That haue to sin beene ready prest, Let now to goodnesse be enclinde. 6 Of his affections. My harts affections fully fraught, With sundry sinfull passions, From henceforth, let them all be taught, To leaue such detestations. 7 Of his sences. My sences seeming in their kind, VVith fading pleasures to abound, Heareafter (Lord) their lusts fast binde, In moderation to be found. 8 Of his bodily members. The members of my bodie fraile, VVhich haue beene bent to all kind euill, Let them (O Lord) no more preuaile, To displease thee, and please the Deuill. 9 My wandring eyes in worldly lust, Of his eies VVhich tooke their pleasure night and day, Translate their sight to obiects iust Thereby to please thee all they may. 10 Mine eares, that chiefely tooke delight, Of his eares. In foolish, vaine, and fruitles sounds, Make them heareafter to despyght, All such vnsure, deceitfull grounds. 11 My tongue, that I could seldome baulke, Of his tongue. From discoursing of vanities, Restraine henceforth: And now to taulke, Of thy iust lawes and misteries 12 My hands so nimble, ready bent, Of his handes. To wanton sports and idle play, Heareafter let theyr time be spent, In doing good each kind of way. 13 My Armes and Legges that haue beene strong, Of his armes and Legges. To prosecute my wicked will, Keep henceforth (Lord) from offering wrong, And thy mind alwaies to fulfill. 14 My feete, that haue beene often prest, Of his feet To follow sin and vaine excesse, Make them heareafter with the rest, To haunt the waies of Godlinesse. 15 And to conclude (Lord) mortifie, Of soule &amp; body.All sin in Soule and body to, That henceforth they may both agree, Thy will in all things for to do. 16 Of both their delights.O let them make their chiefest ioy, To heare and read thy holy word, Which shall keepe them from all annoy, When faith and life thereto accord. 17 The conclusion.Then shall I be thy Seruant deere, When all my powers aright do frame, Then shall I raigne with thee else-where, And euer blesse thy holy name. A recapitulation of all before spoken, with humble thankefulnesse for Gods exceeding goodnesse, to his redeemed. 1 O Blessed God omnipotent, How much is mankind bound to thee, For all thy workes so excellent, As thou hast set them in degree. The footeLet Heauen, let Earth, and all therein, Sound out thy worthy prayse, Let Saints and Angels first begin, To laud thy name alwaies. 2 Thou (blessed Lord) the Heauens didst frame, Most glorious in our mortall eyes, The Sunne, the Moone, the Stars by name, That shine so bright in azure skies. Let Heauen, &amp;c. 4 Thou (blessed Lord) the earth didst make, And all that therein doth abound, The Sea with Fish, (all for our sake,) With flying Foules aboue the ground. Let Heauen, &amp;c. 4 Thou (blessed Lord) aboue all these, Didst mankind make most excellent, That they might seeke thee still to please, And with their guifts to be content. Let Heauen, &amp;c. 5 Thou (blessed Lord) when man had lost, His happy state (through sinfull fall) Didst send thy Son, (whose might is most,) That he should reconcile vs all. Let Heauen, &amp;c. 6 Thou (blessed Lord) when Deuils and Death, Did seeke to bring vs all to Hell, Then sentest thou (as Scripture saith,) Thine onely Sonne their force to quell, Let Heauen, &amp;c. 7 Thou (blessed Lord) when sinne vs held, That we could neuer come to thee, Didst send thy Sonne, who hath expeld, His force that we might freed be. Let heauen, &amp;c. 8 That wee feele th? faintly.Thou (blessed Lord) when we lacke faith, Or workes the same for to expresse, Both these, thy grace supplyed hath, That we might come to blessednesse. Let heauen, &amp;c. 9 For all these fauours in thy word, Whereby thy kindnesse is exprest, We magnifie thy name (O Lord) Who euer was and shall be blest. Let heauen, let earth, and all therein, Sound out thy worthy praise, Let Saints and Angels first begin, To laud thy name alwaies. Infallible tokens of predestation vnto Saluation. 1 He that doth looke to raigne with Christ, In euerlasting blessednesse, Must take great care that he persist, In these degrees of holinesse. 2 The first, He must lament his sin, Whereby he hath offended God, And seeke to come no more therein, Least he correct him with his rod, 3 The second, He must loue Gods house, To learne his dutie willingly, And thither often take his course, To worship God vnfainedly. 4 The third, He must set his delight, To heare and read Gods holy word, And often meditate on it, His goodnesse daily to record. 5 The fourth, He must remember well, VVhat is contrary to Gods will, To shunne that way which leads to Hell, And pray for grace against all ill. 6 The fift, He must the truth professe, And practise it accordingly, That words and workes may both expresse, He holdeth with the verity. 7 The sixt, He must do no man wrong, For no respect in any case, Nor any that to him belong, But make amends (if he trespasse) 8 The seauenth: He must be ready prest, To put vp wrongs at others hands, And pray for them, (as for the rest) To rid them out of Sathans bands. 9 The eight, He must be doing good, Yea rich in good workes day by day, To help the hungry vnto food, And further learning all he may. 10 The ninth: He must dispose himselfe, To leaue the pleasures of this life, And greedy seeking worthy pelfe, Which worketh woe and endlesse strife. 11 The tenth: He must with patience, Prepare himselfe to beare Christs Crosse, Or any scourge for his offence, Which in the end will gaine the losse. 12 The eleuenth; He must prouide for death, (As if his bed should be his graue.) To liue in peace, whilst he hath breath, That after Christ his soule may saue. 13 The twelft, He must in all distresse, Of sicknesse, paine, or punishment, Then, hope for Christ his blessednesse, VVhich aye shall last, when life is spent. 14 The thirteenth, He must often pray. That Sathans Kingdome may surcease, And Christ his glory euery way, May daily more and more increase. 15 The fourteenth, He must euer long, To be with Christ in his sweete blisse, To sing that endlesse ioyfull song, All praise to him, whose right it is. 16 The more that any mortall wight, VVith these good graces doth abound, The deerer he is in Gods sight, And so for euer shall be found.
