      <field name="fulltext">Dispise not councel, rebuking foly Esteme it as, nedefull and holy. THE AUCTOURS NAME IN VERDYT. Saye well some wyll by this my labour Euery man yet Wyll not say the same Amonge the good I doubt not fauour God them forgeue For it me blame Eche man I wyshe It shall offende Reade and then iudge Where faulte is amende. Face aut Tace. The schoole of vertue. First in the mornynge when thou dost awake To God for his grace thy peticion then make; This prayer folowynge vse dayly to say, Thy harte lyftynge vp; Thus begyn to pray: The mornynge prayer. “O God, from whom al good gifts procede! To thee we repayre in tyme of our nede, That with thy grace thou wouldst vs endue Vertue to folowe and vyce to exchue: Heare this our request, and graunt our desyre, O lorde! moste humbly we do the requyre! This day vs defende, that we walkynge aryght May do the thynge acceptable in thy syght, That as we in yeares And body do growe, So in good vertues we may lykewyse flowe To thy honour, and ioy of our parentes, Learninge to lyue well, and kepe thy commaundmentes; In flyinge from all Vice, synne, and cryme, Applyinge our bookes, not losynge our tyme, May fructifye and go forwarde here in good doynge In this vale of miserie vnto oure lyuees endynge, That after this lyfe here transitory We may attayne to greater glory.” The Lordes prayer then se thou recyte, So vsynge to do at mornynge and nyght. Howe to order thy selfe when thou rysest, and in apparelynge thy body. Capitulo .i. Flye euer slouthe and ouer much slepe; In health the body therby thou shalte kepe. Muche slepe ingendereth diseases and payne, It dulles the the wyt and hurteth the brayne. Early in the mornynge thy bed then forsake, Thy rayment put on, thy selfe redy make. To cast vp thy bed It shalbe thy parte, Els may they say that beastly thou art; So to departe and let the same lye, It is not semynge nor yet manerly. Downe from thy chamber when thou shalte go, Thy parentes salute thou, and the famely also; Thy handes se thou washe, and thy hed keame, And of thy rayment se torne be no seame; Thy cappe fayre brusht, thy hed couer than, Takynge it of In speakynge to any man. Cato doth councel thee thyne elders to reuerence Declarynge therby thy dutye and obedience. Thy shyrte coler fast to thy necke knyt; Comely thy rayment loke on thy body syt. Thy gyrdell about thy wast then fasten, Thy hose fayre rubd thy showes se be cleane. A napkyn se that thou haue in redines Thy nose to clense from all fylthynes. Thy nayles, yf nede be, se that thou payre; Thyne eares kepe cleane, thy teath washe thou fayre. If ought about thee chaunce to be torne, Thy frendes therof shewe howe it is worne, And they wyll newe for thee prouyde, Or the olde mende, In tyme beinge spyde, This done, thy setchell and thy bokes take, And to the scole haste see thou make. But ere thou go, with thy selfe forthynke. That thou take with thee pen, paper, and ynke; For these are thynges for thy study necessary, Forget not then with thee them to cary. The souldiar preparynge hym selfe to the fielde Leaues not at home his sworde and his shielde, No more shulde a scoler forget then truly what he at scole shulde nede to occupy. These thynges thus had, Take strayght thy way Vnto the schole without any stay. Howe to behaue thy selfe in going by the streate and in the schoole [Capitulo] .ii. In goynge by the way and passynge the strete, Thy cappe put of, Salute those ye mete; In geuynge the way to suche as passe by, It is a poynte of siuilitie. And thy way fortune so for to fall, Let it not greue thee thy felowes to call. when to the schole thou shalte resort, This rule note well I do the exhort: Thy master there beynge, Salute with all reuerence, Declarynge thereby thy dutye and obedience; Thy felowes salute In token of loue, Lest of inhumanitie they shall thee reproue. Vnto thy place appoynted for to syt, Streight go thou to, and thy setchel vnknyt, Thy bokes take out, thy lesson then learne Humbly thy selfe Behaue and gouerne. Therein takynge payne, with all thyne industry Learnynge to get thy boke well applye: All thynges seme harde when we do begyn, But labour and diligence yet both them wyn; we ought not to recken and coumpt the thyng harde That bryngeth ioye and pleasure afterwarde; Leaue of then laboure, and the lacke rue, Lament and repent when age doth insue. Deades that deserued Fame and greate prayse, Buried had ben, we se in olde dayes; If letters had not then brought them to lyght The truth of suche thynges who coulde nowe resyght? Applye thy minde to learnynge and scyence, For learnynge in nede wyll be thy defence. Nothinge to science compare we may well, The swetenes wherof all thynges doth excell. And Cato the wyse this worthy sayinge hath, That man wantinge learnynge is as the image of death. The rootes of learnynge most bytter we deme; The fruites at last Moste pleasaunt doth seme. Then labour for learnynge whyle here thou shalt lyue, The ignoraunt to teache, and good example geue; So shalte thou be thought A membre most worthy The common welth to serue In tyme of necessitie. Experience doth teache And shewe to thee playne That many to honour By learninge attayne That were of byrthe But symple and bace,— Suche is the goodnes Of Gods speciall grace,— For he that to honour by vertue doth ryse, Is double happy, and counted most wyse. If doubte thou doest, Desyre to be toulde, No shame is to learne, Beinge neuer so oulde; Ignoraunce doth cause Great errors in vs For wantynge of knowledge Doubts to discusse; Then learne to discerne the good from the yll, And suche as thee warne, Bere them good will. when from the schoole ye shall take your waye, Or orderly then go ye, twoo in aray, your selues matchynge So equall as ye may, That men it seynge May well of you saye In commendynge this your laudable wayes, whiche must nedes sounde to your great prayse, Not runnynge on heapes as a swarme of bees, As at this day Euery man it nowe sees; Not vsynge, but refusynge, Suche foolyshe toyes As commonly are vsed In these dayes of boyes, As hoopynge and halowynge as in huntynge the foxe, That men it hearynge Deryde them with mockes. This foolyshnes forsake, this folly exchewynge, And learne to followe this order insuynge. In goynge by the way Neyther talke nor iangle, Gape not nor gase not at euery newe fangle, But soberly go ye with countinaunce graue; Humblye your selues towarde all men behaue; Be free of cappe and full of curtesye; Greate loue of al men you shall wyn therby. Be lowly and gentyll and of meke moode; Then men con not but of you say good. In passynge the strete Do no man no harme; Vse thou fewe wordes, and thy tounge charme, Then men shal see that grace in the groweth From whom vertues So aboundantly floweth. when thou arte come where thy parentes do dwell, Thy leaue then takynge Byd thy felowes farewell; The house then entrynge, In thy parence presence Humbly salute them with all reuerence. Howe to behaue thi selfe in seruynge the table. Cap. iii. VVhen thy parentes downe to the table shall syt, In place be ready For the purpose moste fyt: With sober countinaunce Lokynge them in the face, Thy handes holdynge vp, this begyn grace: “Geue thankes to God with one accorde For that shall be Set on this borde. And be not carefull what to eate, To eche thynge lyuynge the Lorde sends meate; For foode he wyll not Se you peryshe, But wyll you fede, Foster, and cheryshe; Take well in worth what he hath sent, At this tyme be therwith content, Praysynge God.” So treatablie speakyng as possible thou can, That the hearers therof May thee vnderstan. Grace beynge sayde, Lowe cursie make thou, Sayinge “muche good May it do you.” Of stature then yf thou be able, It shall become thee to serue the table In bringynge to it Suche meate as shall nede For thy parence vpon that tyme to fede. Disshes with measure thou oughtest to fyll, Els mayste thou happen thy seruyce to spyll On theyr apparell Or els on the cloth, whiche for to doe wolde moue them to wroth. Spare trenchers with napkyns haue in redynes To serue afterwarde, If there come any gesse. Be circumspecte; see nothynge do wante; Of necessary thynges that there be no skant, As breade and drynke, se there be plentie; The voyders with bones Ofte se thou emptie. At hande be ready, If any do call, To fetche or take vp, If ought fortune to fall. when they haue done, then ready make The table vp fayre In order to take: Fyrste the saulte Se that thou couer, Hauynge by thee Eyther one or other thynges from thy handes then to conuaye That from the table thou shalt take awaye. A voyder vpon the table then haue, The trenchers and napkyns therein to receaue; The croomes with a napkyn together them swepe, It at the tables ende In a voyder them kepe. Then before eche man A cleane treanchour lay, The best fyrste seruynge, As iudge thou soone may; Then cheese with fruite On the table set, With Bisketes or Carowayes, As you may get. Wyne to them fyll, Els ale or beare; But wyne is metest, If any there were. Then on the table Attende with all diligence, It for to voyde when done haue thy parence: Eche syde of the clothe Do thou tourne in, Foldynge it vp, At the hygher ende begin. A cleane towell then On the table spreade,— The towell wantynge, the cloth take in steade,— The bason and ewer to the table then brynge, In place conuenient theyr pleasure abydynge. when thou shalt see them redy to washe, The ewer take vp, and be not to rashe In powrynge out water More then wyll suffise. The table then voyde that they may ryse. All thynges thus done, forget not thy dutie, Before the table Make thou lowe cursie. Howe to order thy selfe syttynge at the table. Capitulo .iiii. O chyldren! geue eare your duties to learne, Howe at the table you may your selues gouerne. Presume not to hyghe, I say, in no case; In syttynge downe, to thy betters geue place. Suffer eche man Fyrste serued to be, For that is a poynte Of good curtesie. when they are serued, then pause a space, For that is a sygne of nourture and grace. Saulte with thy knyfe then reache and take, The breade cut fayre, And do not it breake. Thy spone with pottage to full do not fyll, For fylynge the cloth, If thou fortune to spyll, For rudnes it is thy pottage to sup, Or speake to any, his head in the cup. Thy knyfe se be sharpe to cut fayre thy meate; Thy mouth not to full when thou dost eate; Not smackynge thy lyppes, As comonly do hogges, Nor gnawynge the bones As it were dogges; Suche rudenes abhorre, Suche beastlynes flie, At the table behaue thy selfe manerly. Thy fyngers se cleane that thou euer kepe, Hauynge a Napkyn thereon them to wype; Thy mouth therwith Cleane do thou make, The cup to drynke In hande yf thou take, Let not thy tongue At the table walke, And of no matter Neyther reason nor talke. Temper thy tongue and belly alway, For “measure is treasure,” the prouerbe doth say, And measure in althynges Is to be vsed; what is without measure Ought to be refused. For silence kepynge thou shalt not be shent, where as thy speache May cause thee repent. Bothe speache and silence are commendable, But sylence is metest In a chylde at the table. And Cato doth saye, that “in olde and yonge The fyrste of vertue Is to kepe thy tonge.” Pyke not thy teethe at the table syttynge, Nor vse at thy meate Ouer muche spytynge; this rudnes of youth Is to be abhorde; thy selfe manerly Behaue at the borde. If occasion of laughter at the table thou se, Beware that thou vse the same moderately. Of good maners learne So muche as thou can; It wyll thee preferre when thou art a man. Aristotle the Philosopher this worthy sayinge writ, That “maners in a chylde are more requisit then playnge on instrumentes and other vayne pleasure; For vertuous maners Is a most precious treasure.” Let not this saynge In no wyse thee offende, For playnge of instrumentes He doth not discommende, But doth graunt them for a chylde necessary, Yet maners muche more see here he doth vary. Refuse not his councell, Nor his wordes dispise; To vertue and knowledge By them mayste thou ryse. Howe to order thy selfe in the Churche. Cap. .v. VVhen to the Churche thou shalt repayer, Knelynge or standynge, to God make thy prayer; All worldely matters From thy mynde set apart, Earnestly prayinge, to God lyfte vp thy hart. A contrite harte He wyll not dispyse, whiche he doth coumpt A sweete sacrifice. To hym thy sinnes shewe and confesse, Askynge for them Grace and forgyuenes; He is the Phisition that knoweth thy sore, And can to health A-gayne thee restore. Aske then in fayth, Not doubtynge to haue; The thynges ye desyre ye shall then receaue; So they be lawfull Of God to requyre, He wyll the heare and graunt thy desyre; More mercifull he is then pen can expresse, The aucthor and geuer here of all goodnesse. “All ye that laboure and burdened be, I wyll you refreshe In commynge to me.” These are Chrystes wordes, the scripture is playne, Spoken to all suche as here suffre payne; Our wylles to his worde then let vs frame, The heauenly habytacion therby we may clame. In the churche comly thy selfe do behaue, In vsage sober, thy countinaunce graue. whyle you be there, taulke of no matter, Nor one with an other whisper nor chatter. Reuerently thy selfe Order alwaye when to the Churche thou shalt come to pray: Eche thynge hath his tyme, Consyder the place, For that is a token of vertue and grace, The Lorde doth call it the house of prayer And not to be vsed As is a fayer. The fruites of gamynge, vertue and learnynge. Capitulo .vi. O lytle chylde, Eschewe thou euer game,— For that hath brought Many one to shame,— As dysynge, and cardynge, And suche other playes, which many vndoeth as we se nowe a dayes. But yf thou delyght In any earthly thynge, Delyght in knowledge, Vertue, and learnynge, For learnynge wyll leade thee to the schoole of vertue, And vertue wyll teache thee Vice to subdue. Vice beynge subdued, thou canst not but floryshe; Happy is the man that vertue doth norysh. By knowledge lykewyse thou shalt doubtes discerne, By vertue agayne thy lyfe well gouerne. These be the frutes By them we do take, Cursed is he then that doth them forsake. But we erre in wyt In folowynge our wyll, In iudgynge that good which playnly is yll. Let reason thee rule, and not will thee leade To folowe thy fansie, A wronge trace to treade. But subdue thy luste, and conqeur thy wyll If it shall moue thee to doe that is yll; For what hurte by game to many doth growe, No wyse man I thynke but doth it well knowe. Experience doth shewe and make it manifeste That all good men can it but deteste, As strife and debate, murder and thefte, whiche amonge christians, wolde god were lefte, with cursynge and bannynge, with swearyng and tearyng, That no honest harte can abyde the hearyng: These be the fruites that of them doth sprynge, with many more as euill that cometh of gamynge. How to behaue thy selfe in taulkynge with any man. Capitulo .vii. If a man demaunde a question of thee, In thine aunswere makynge be not to hastie; waie well his wordes, the case vnderstande Eare an answere to make thou take in hande, Els may he iudge in thee little wit, To answere to a thynge and not heare it. Suffer his tale whole out to be toulde, Then speake thou mayst, and not be controulde; Low obeisaunce makyng, lokinge him in the face, Tretably speaking, thy wordes see thou place. with countinaunce sober thy bodie vprighte Thy fete iuste to-gether, thy handes in lyke plight; Caste not thyne eies on neither syde. when thou arte praised, therin take no pryde. In tellynge thy tale, neither laugh nor smyle, Such folly forsake thou, banish and exyle; In audible voice thy wordes do thou vtter, Not hie nor lowe, but vsynge a measure. Thy wordes se that thou pronounce plaine, And that they spoken Be not in vayne; In vttryng wherof Kepe thou an order, Thy matter therby thou shalte much forder; whiche order yf thou Do not obserue, From the purpose nedes must thou swarue, And hastines of speche wyll cause thee to erre, Or wyll thee teache to stut or stammer. To stut or stammer is a foule crime, Learne then to leaue it, take warnyng in tyme; How euyll a chylde it doth become, Thy selfe beynge iudge, hauinge wisedome; And sure it is taken by custome and vre, whyle yonge you be there is helpe and cure. This generall rule yet take with the, In speakynge to any man Thy head vn-couered be. The common prouerbe remember ye oughte, “Better vnfedde then vn-taughte.” How to order thy selfe being sente of message. Cap. viii. If of message forthe thou be sente, Take hede to the same, Geue eare diligente; Depart not awaye and beyng in doute, Know wel thy message before thou passe out; with possible spede then hast thee right sone; If nede shall requirr it so to be done. After humble obeisaunce, the message forth shewe Thy wordes well placinge in vttringe but fewe As shall thy matter serue to declare. Thine answere made, then home againe repare, And to thy master therof make relacion As then the answere shall geue thee occasion. Neither adde nor deminish any thynge to the same, Lest after it proue to thy rebuke and shame, But the same vtter so nere as thou can; No faulte they shall fynde to charge thee with than, In most humble wyse loke done that it be, As shall become beste a seruantes degre. A-gainste Anger, Enuie, and malice. Cap. ix. If thou be subiecte and to anger thrall, And reason thee rule not, nedes must thou fall. Conquer thy wyll and subdue thy luste, Thy fansy not folowing, thy cause though be iuste; For anger and furie wyll thee so chaunge That thy doynges to wise men wyll appeare straunge. Thine anger and wrath seke then to appeace, For wrath, saith Plato, Leades shame in a leace. The hastie man wantes neuer trouble, His mad moody mynde his care doth double. And malyce thee moue to reuenge thy cause, Dread euer god, and daunger of the lawes. Do not reuenge, though in thy power it be, Forgeue the offender being thine enemie. He is perfectely pacient, we may repute plaine, [That] From wrath and furye himselfe can refrayne. Disdayne nor enuie The state of thy brother, In worde nor dede not hurtyng one an other. Debate and disceate, contencion and enuie, Are the chiefe frutes of an euyll bodie. And Salomon saithe “The harte full of enuie, Of him selfe hath no pleasure nor commoditie.” The fruites of charitie, loue, and pacience. Cap. x. Charitie seketh not that to her doth belonge, But paciently a-bydinge, sustainynge rather wronge; Not enuiynge, but bearinge with loue and pacience,— So noble is her nature,— forgeuing all ofence. And loue doth moue the mynde to mercie, But malice againe doth worke the contrarie. whiche in the wicked wyll euer beare stroke, Pacience thee teacheth therof to beare the yoke. where pacience and loue to-gether do dwell All hate and debate, with malice, they expell. Loue constant and faithfull, Pithagoras doth call To be a vertue most principall. Plato doth speake almoste in effecte ‘where loue is not, no vertue is perfecte.’ Desire then god to assiste thee with his grace Charitie to vse and pacience to imbrace; These three folowinge will thee instructe, That to vertues schoole they wyll thee conducte, And from vertues schoole to eternall blisse where incessaunt ioie continually is. A-gainge (so) the horrible vice of swearynge. Cap. xi. In vaine take not the name of god; Swere not at all for feare of his rod. The house with plagues he threteneth to visit where othes are vsed: they shall not escape it. Iuste are his iudgementes, and true is his worde, And sharper then is a two edged sworde; wherfore beware thou his heauy indignacion, And learne to lyue well in thy vocacion wherin that god shall thee set or call; Rysinge againe— if it fortune to fall— By prayer and repentance, whiche is the onely waie. Christ wolde not the death of a sinner, I saye, But rather he turne From his wickednesse, And so to lyue in vertue and goodnesse. what better art thou for this thy swearyng Blasfamouslye, the name of god tearyng? Prouokynge his yre and kyndlinge his wrath Thee for to plauge, that geuinge the hath Knowlage and reason thy selfe for to rule, And for to flee the thynge that is euyl. Senica doth councell thee all swerynge to refrayne, Although great profite by it thou mighte gaine: Pericles, whose wordes are manifeste and playne, From sweryng admonisheth thee to obstaine; The lawe of god, and commaundement he gaue, Swearynge amongst vs in no wyse wolde haue. The councell of philosoph[ers] I haue here expreste, Amongest whom sweryng was vtterly deteste; Much lesse amongest christians ought it to be vsed, But vtterly of them cleane to be refused. A-gainste the vice of filthy talkynge. Cap. xii. No filthy taulke in no wise vse, Thy tonge therby for to abuse. Of euery idell worde an accumpte we shall render;— All men I woulde this sayinge to remember;— To god for it at the generall daie In earnest or sporte we shall speake or saie; whiche daye to the iuste shalbe most ioyfull, And to the wicked againe as wofull. As we here doe, so shall we receaue, Vnles we repente and mercy of god craue. If god wyll deale with vs so straight For thinges that be of so small waight, Then haue we cause to feare and dreade, Our lyues lewdly if we haue leade. Thy tonge take hede thou doe refrayne From speakyng wordes that are moste vayne; Thy wyll and witte to goodnes applie, Thy mynde exercise in vertuous studie. A-gainste the vice of lyinge. Capitulo .xiii. To forge, to fayne, to flater and lye, Requiere diuers collours with wordes fayre and slye, But the vtteraunce of truthe is so simple and playne That it nedeth no studie to forge or to fayne; wherfore saye truth, how euer stand the case, So shalte thou fynde more fauour and grace. Vse truthe, and say truth, in that thou goest aboute, For tyme of althinges the truthe wyll bringe out. Shame is the rewarde For lying dewe; Then auoyde shame, and vtter wordes trewe. A lyar by his lying this profet doth get, That whan he saith truth no man wyll him credet; Then let thy talke with the truth agree, And blamed for it thou shalte neuer bee. Howe maie a man a lyer ought truste? But doubte his dedes, his woordes being vniuste. In tellyng of truth there lougeth no shame, Where vttring of lyes deserueth much blame; And though a lye from stripes ye once saue, Thrise for that once it wyll the desceue; Truste then to truth, and neither forge nor fayne, And followe these preceptes: from liyng do refraine. A praier to be saide when thou goest to bedde. O mercifull god! heare this our requeste, And graunte vnto vs this nighte quiet reste. Into thy tuicoin, oh lorde, do vs take! Our bodies slepynge, our myndes yet maie wake. Forgeue the offences this daye we haue wroughte A-gainste thee and our neighbour in worde, dede, and thoughte! And graunte vs thy grace hense forth to flie sinne, And that a newe lyfe we maie nowe beginne! Deliuer and defende vs this night from all euell, And from the daunger of our enemie, the diuell, whiche goeth a-boute sekyng his praie, And by his crafte whom we maie betraie. Assiste vs, oh lorde, with thy holy sprite, That valiantly against him we maie euer fighte; And winning the victorie, maie lifte vp our voice, And in his strength faithfully reioice, Saying, “to the lorde be all honour and praise For his defence bothe now and alwaies!” the dutie of eche degred. (so) brefely declared. 1 Ye princes, that the earth rule and gouerne, Seke ye for knowledge doubtes to discerne. 2 Ye iudges, geue iudgement according to righte As may be founde acceptable in the lordes sight. 3 Ye prelates, preache purely the worde of our lorde, That your liuings &amp; prechinges in one maie accorde. 4 Ye fathers and mothers, so your children instructe As maye them to grace and uertue conducte. 5 Ye chyldren, lykewyse obey your parentes here; In all godlinesse see that ye them feare. 6 Ye maisters, do you the thynge that is righte Not lokynge what ye may do by mighte. 7 Ye seruauntes, applie your busines and arte, Doinge the same in singlenesse of harte. 8 Ye husbandes, loue your wyues, and with them dwell, All bitternesse set aparte, vsing wordes gentell. 9 Ye wyues, to your husbandes be obedient alwaie, For they are your heades, and ye bounde to obeie. 10 Ye persons and vickers that haue cure and charge, Take hede to the same, and roue not at large. 11 Ye men of lawe, in no wyse delaie The cause of the poore, but helpe what ye maie. 12 Ye that be craftes men, vse no disceite, Geuing to all men tale, measure, and weighte. 13 Ye that be landlordes and haue housen to let, At reasonable rentes do them forth set. 14 Ye merchauntes that vse the trade of merchandise, Vse lawfull wares and reasonable prise. 15 Ye subiectes, lyue ye in obedience and awe, Fearyng gods stroke, and daunger of the lawe. 16 Ye rych, whom god hath goods vnto sente, Releue the poore and helpe the indigente. 17 Ye that are poore, with your state be contente, Not hauinge wherwith to lyue competente. 18 Ye magestrates, the cause of the widdow and fatherles Defende againste suche as shall them opresse. 19 All ye that are called to any other office, Execute the same accordinge to iustice. 20 Let eche here so liue in his vocacion, As maie his soule saue, and profet his nacion. 21 This graunting god, that sitteth on hie, we shall here well lyue and after well die.
