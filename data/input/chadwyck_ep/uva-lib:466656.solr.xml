      <field name="fulltext">TO E. M. This little book, meet inmate of thy bower, Accept, a husband's gift, beloved wife! It wooes the mind to scan the Saviour's life; And, if He will, may haply have the power To cheer a sad, or soothe a restless, hour; To smooth with oil, from Salem's mountains brought, The rising billows of o'er-anxious thought, And light with rainbow hues the darkling shower. Peace be within thy dwelling! Who, as thou, May claim for comfort all my feeble aid? For thrice nine years affection's mutual vow Hath thee my heart's and life's companion made: Once dear in health and youth; but dearer now, When youth hath waned, and health begun to fade! R. D. &amp; C. December 22, 1831. THE CHILD JESUS IN THE TEMPLE. Luke ii. 41â52. As in some safe sequester'd spot, By common eyes unheeded not, A tender sapling grows; Till high to heav'n it rears its head, And far and wide o'er earth outspread Its arms o'ershadowing throws: Meanwhile the gardener's hand around Hath clear'd from noxious weeds the ground, Lest aught should mar the root; And year by year his careful eye Sees thro' the dews of heav'n more high Ascend the graceful shoot: Such year by year, thro' childhood, youth, And prime of manhood, was the growth Of Mary's Saviour child! Tho' still his Father's hand was nigh, And still well pleas'd his Father's eye Survey'd each virtue mild; Scarce mark'd he grew, till on his head 'Mid Jordan's flood the Spirit shed In radiant glory shone, All bright and hovering like a dove; And the dread voice of God above Proclaim'd him for his own. One scene to note his opening years, One scene alone portray'd appears In God's recording roll, When, ere the downy cheek began To indicate the future man, His more expanded soul, On high and holy visions bent, In Sion's sacred temple spent Day thrice succeeding day, Nor heeded that his kindred train Afar from Salem's tow'rs again Pursued their homeward way. As on they went o'er rock and dell, Or camp'd beside the limpid well, Afar on Sion's hill His Father's house still claim'd his care, And on his Father's business there Intent he linger'd still. There 'mid the sages of thy law Thine eyes the child, O Salem, saw, While transport strange to hear His questions apt, his prompt replies, A mind so soon, so deeply, wise, Held fix'd thy raptur'd ear. Not rash perhaps, nor vain the task, With no presumptuous aim to ask, As on the page we gaze, Why by the unerring pen was brought That scene before the Christian's thought Of Jesus' early days? Was it, that childhood's tender age Might copy from that fruitful page A pattern undefil'd; And youth perchance a lesson learn, And manhood's self its part discern Ensampled in a child? Was it perchance, with kind intent, (Since Jesus with his parents went To Sion's templed steep, From worldly cares and thoughts releas'd, The seasons of the appointed feast With solemn rites to keep;) To shew how lovely is the sight, When those by nature join'd unite Religion's rites to grace; And children with their parents go, Reverence for God's high feasts to shew, In God's appointed place? Wast it to shew, (that holy court Since Jesus made his lov'd resort, A stripling of his age,) How well the house, the truth, of God, By childish footsteps may be trod, May childish thoughts engage? Was it, (since there his humble seat Respectful at the Rabbin's feet The heaven-sent hearer took, On those, who taught in Moses' chair, Content with meek inquiring air And answers sage to look;) To shew how well become the young Such thirst for truth as prompts the tongue To modesty of speech, The eye submiss, the list'ning ear, When men of graver age are near, Whom God hath will'd to teach? Was it, (since all around amaz'd, As on his youthful face they gaz'd, His voice of wisdom heard;) To shew, e'en then how brightly shin'd In human form the heavenly mind Of God's eternal Word? Was it (since thence returning down To distant Nazareth's humble town, He there obedient stay'd To those who bore a parent's name, And what parental love might claim With filial duty paid;) To shew, when all to God is given, Earth's duties still with love of heaven Demand divided care; Whilst He, who claims the perfect heart, Vouchsafes no less to yield a part, The earthly parent's share? Howe'er it be, on that brief page, Which paints the Saviour's childish age, 'Tis sweet in thought to dwell, And ponder every act and word, As by his pensive mother stor'd In memory's faithful cell: The wish, which sought his Father's shrine; The mind, which drank of love divine; The soul, which upward flew To commune with his Sire above; The signs of meekness, awe, and love, To earthly claimants due: And thence 'tis sweet to cast the eye And with prospective glance supply The blameless course he ran; While ever, as his stature rose, In wisdom and in grace he grows, Endear'd to God and man. O, may the children of his fold In mind retain, in deed unfold, That holy pattern mild: Nor youth, nor life's meridian glow, Nor the calm eve of eld forego The virtues of the child! CHRIST BAPTIZED. Matt. iii. 13â17; Mark i. 9â11; Luke iii. 21, 22. âCry aloud, shew my people their sins, My flock their iniquities shew!â Hark, a voice from the desert of Judah begins, And its theme is of guilt and of woe. âRepent ye,â it cries: the dread sounds Thro' the rocks and the valleys are sent: From the rocks and the valleys the warning rebounds, And Jordan re-echoes, âRepent ye, repent!â By the side of the time-honour'd wave The Preacher has chosen his stand, Prepar'd in the bath of repentance to lave Whom humility brings to his hand. There Jerusalem gathers around; And Judea assembles to hear; And the regions of Jordan, awak'd at the sound, To the âPreacher of righteousnessâ hearken and fear. In raiment of camel's hair clad, Round his loins a coarse girdle of skin, With language austere and with countenance sad He proclaims the just judgment of sin. âSee, the axe is laid home to the root, And the tree, which of penitence bears not the fruit, Shall be hewn by the steel, and consum'd by the flame.â Is there one in that numberless throng, Whose conscience, whose heart, is not rent By that warning portentous? who never did wrong, And who needs not, who cannot, repent? If there be such, why tarries he here? Why in humble obscurity lies? Let him hence from the soul-stricken crowd, or draw near, And himself in the stream the Baptizer baptize. Such there is in the midst of the crowd, As yet to his fellows unknown. But the Baptist, he knows, he proclaims it aloud; He fears not self-humbled to own, How ill may his grandeur and birth With that Unknown's pretensions compare; How unworthy were he ev'n to stoop to the earth, His feet to unsandal, his sandals to bear. âI baptize you with water,â he cries; âTo work your repentance I aim: But He, who is greater than I, shall baptize With the Spirit of God and with flame. In his hand is his van, and his floor He shall thoroughly purge in his ire; And the grain in his garner collected shall store, But burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.â But why does the Baptist refrain To yon stranger ablution to give? Why ponder, and linger, as if he would fain His own rite from another receive? And why does he vanquish'd submit Obedient at length to his will? And what mean those words, âLet it be, for 'tis fit The appointed solemnities thus to fulfil?â Ask no more, but look onward, and view From the bank where in converse they stood, At Bethabara's passage together the two Are gone down to the willow-edg'd flood. The Baptist hath finish'd his rite: The Baptiz'd rises fresh from the stream: And forth as he passes and prays, to his sight Unfolded the courts of the firmament gleam. On his head from the mansions above Slow lighting, as over her nest With tremulous brilliancy hovers a dove, See the Spirit of holiness rest: And lo, as that splendour ye see, From âthe excellent gloryâ a voice, âMy Son, my beloved, behold this is He, My only-begotten, in whom I rejoice!â O well might the Baptist profess, âHe is nobler and greater than I;â Himself might he well a mere menial confess, Unworthy his shoes to untie: And well might he bid him declare, Tho' âmore than a prophetâ were he, âWhy com'st Thou my bath of repentance to share? I have need, I have need, to be cleansed by Thee.â Yea, with thoughts and affections more clear Than, Jordan, thy crystalline wave, More pure than the light that illumines the sphere, In that water he needed not lave. But he chooses for righteousness' sake To bathe all unsullied therein, That he to the world an example may make, And hallow the font for the cleansing of sin. For still, by his mystical rite, His priests with the word and with pray'r To the laver of faith and repentance invite The children of sin to repair. And there in the sanctified flood He washes their nature defil'd, Where the life-giving Spirit takes pleasure to brood, And the Father salutes each regenerate child. O blessed, thrice blessed are they, Who, true to their spiritual birth, Endeavour the image of Christ to display In their pilgrimage here upon earth. They have plighted fidelity's vow, They have chosen the militant part; The sign of allegiance, then traced on their brow, Remains aye impress'd on the core of their heart. In the storms and the strife of the world, To âthe Amen, the Faithful, and True,â They look: o'er their head is his banner unfurl'd; And, trusting in that to subdue, They with faith, hope, and charity hold Right on, where their âCaptainâ has trod; See in prospect the gates of his kingdom unfold, And rejoice in the promis'd effulgence of God. THE MARRIAGE IN CANA. John ii. 1â11. Begirt with many a cheerful guest, Light hearts and faces gay, Reclin'd at Cana's nuptial feast, Serene the Saviour lay. Its course the appointed hour has roll'd To stamp the unerring sign, Which characters his earthly mould With lineaments divine. âThe ewers with water to the brim Fill full, then forth be pour'd The goodly draught, and borne to him Chief of the festal board!â 'Tis done: the ewers from mixture free Receive the crystal stream; But âmantling in the goblet seeâ The âliquid rubyâ gleam. The will untold, the unutter'd thought, By nature heard, declare Him who her works to being brought, And form'd them as they are: Him at whose will the fountain wells, The limpid current flows, The grape to purple ripeness swells, The generous vintage glows. But marks of goodness, as of power, The Saviour's presence tell. He courted not the hermit's bower, The sad recluse's cell; The gifts, bestow'd âman's heart to cheer,â He thought not scorn to know; Nor chill'd, with gloomy brow austere, The bosom's kindly glow. Mark him, in this triumphal hour, When glory round him shone! Those gifts 'twas his abroad to shower, Those feelings kind to own; With milder rays the act to blend Which spoke the Godhead near, The charities, which friend to friend, And man to man, endear. The pristine state in paradise, That first, that best, decree, For new-form'd man, when all was bliss, For all from sin was free; That holy state himself to grace, And grant the wedded pair The first effulgence of his face, His first-fruit gifts to share:â On friends, and friendly kinsmen dear, Guests at the genial hearth, Kind boon to shed of social cheer, Of festive harmless mirth:â Him too, the goodman of the place, Whose hospitable will Griev'd lest his store, that wan'd apace, Should fail its part to fill; To him his kindly aid to bring, And bid from yonder row Of vessels, brimming from the spring, The ruddy beverage flow; With such considerate care benign, That not the ruler knew, Whence, as he sipp'd the generous wine, The rich supply he drew:â 'Tis lovely all: with kindness fraught, With kindness as with power! Dwells on the scene the raptur'd thought; And, in that festal hour, Delights, amid His glory's blaze, The Prince of Peace to scan, The Sun with healing in his rays, Emmanuel, God with man. Fair scene for doubting man to view, Where faith a rest may find; And charity the track pursue Of gentle Virtue kind! Fair scene, and meet for God to see, Grac'd by his only Son: Deeds like His own in majesty, In bounty like his own! So when at infant nature's birth The Maker look'd around, And view'd his new-created earth With life and plenty crown'd; With what was pleasant to the sight, And what was sweet for food; His work he ponder'd with delight, For, lo! it all was good. THE BUYERS AND SELLERS DRIVEN FROM THE TEMPLE. John ii. 13â16. In Sion's court what noise confounds, What sights distract, the ear and eye? A mingled mass, the jarring sounds, Of traffickers, that sell and buy. And there in crowded stalls appear The bleating sheep, the lowing steer, Join'd with the turtle's ceaseless moan: And there, on yonder tables' range, Their coins the money-barterers change; And Mammon holds his mart hard by Jehovah's throne. I guess the cause: from far away The scatter'd sons of Israel come, The appointed sacrifice to pay, And bow in God's appointed dome. And so, the pilgrim train before, Thy merchants, Salem, spread their store; That each, in homage to his King, Some from the costlier flock or herd, Meet offering some of meaner bird, And some of Judah's coin the stated gift may bring. But say, the fatted beast to stall, And urge the money-changer's trade, Fit cause too oft for angry brawl, Too oft for fraud and plunder made, No place can Salem's streets supply, But Sion's Temple, where the High And Holy One his name hath fix'd; And calls his votaries to repair To his own house, his house of pray'r, Most grateful then, when least with earthly passions mix'd? What if a reverence more profound, A holier awe, ye think, may dwell Within the temple's inner bound, Where meet the sons of Israel; Yet shall not they, of alien race, Who tread the temple's outer space, There worship, safe from sounds profane? And He, who gives that house to bear His own dread name, his love to share, Say, shall not He his right o'er all the house maintain? So teaches One, within the fane Whom now ye see with pow'r appear. The Temple's Lord, from worldly stain He comes the temple's courts to clear. As from some royal raiment's fold, Rich cloth of silver or of gold, Each spot the fuller clears away; Or as the ore the finer fines, Till forth the precious metal shines, Purg'd from the dross impure with unimpeded ray: So shall He sit and purify The house, the rites, the priests of God; And to his haughty foes apply The terrors of his vengeful rod. Then who among the sons of pride Shall brook his wrath, or who abide The coming of that fiery day?â Suffice him now, yon crowd profane From deeds unhallow'd to restrain, And 'mid his temple-courts that desecration stay. A scourge of twisted bulrush wrought, No harsher weapon needs He ply: And they that sold, and they that bought, And sheep and steers before Him fly. The exchangers from their seat He spurns; The tables, heap'd with coins, o'erturns; And âHence,â with voice indignant cries; (That voice the crowds submissive own,) âHence, with these things profane, begone; Nor make my Father's house a house of merchandize!â Full well I deem those words were said, And well I deem that deed was done, That He might thence stand forth display'd The eternal Father's only Son. I deem that He, who thus could speak, Whom thus, of human semblance weak, At once the fear-struck crowds obey; What tho' a servant's form He wear, Thus claims, his Father's rightful heir, His own paternal house with filial pow'r to sway. Nor less I deem, this sign of pow'r Once and again by Him was done; Once, in his glory's morning hour, Again, ere set his evening sun; To shew that none, who humbly seek The house of God with spirit meek, Shall fail his watchful eye to share; And none with earth's defilements base May dare to mar the holy place, Which God proclaims his own, and calls to worship there. His house to Salem's gates no more, And Sion's pleasant hill confin'd, Himself hath spread earth's empire o'er, Where flows the sea, where breathes the wind. No parting walls with pillar'd pride Now each from each its courts divide; No scrolls with stern inscription say, âThe chosen race may pass within,â While those less favour'd 'mid the din Of men and stabled beasts may worship as they may. Who in his courts would worship now, The unfolded gates receive them there, To pour the unmolested vow, The sacred peacefulness of pray'r. There may the quiet heart rejoice To lift devotion's humble voice; There with attention's stedfast ear Drink from the well of truth divine; And to Jehovah's inmost shrine Draw with unfeigned faith and true repentance near. Seek ye his house, who name his name! Within his house himself is found. There give him all his honour's claim, âThe place ye tread is holy ground!â Far thence the cares of mortal life, The thirst of gold, the din of strife, The thought which cleaves to earth be driven! âHow dreadful is that holy place!â How full of majesty and grace! âBehold the house of God! behold the gate of heaven!â THE NOBLEMAN OF CAPERNAUM. John iv. 46â54. âWoe unto thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! works of wonder, such as ye, Had Tyre and Sidon witness'd, they had spread Their loins with sackcloth, and with dust their head. And thou, Capernaum, who exaltest high Thy head to heav'n, thou low as hell shalt lie! Had Sodom witness'd wonders, such as thou, Safe from the fiery flood Sodom had flourish'd now.â Great works and wonderful 'twas yours to see Wrought in your coasts, ye towns of Galilee; But chiefly thine, thou of the silver spring! What time, Capernaum, heav'n's incarnate King Chose 'mid thy gorgeous domes his mean abode: Great works and full of wonder there he show'd; But work more great and full of wonder none, Than that which cloth'd with health the noble courtier's son. On life's last edge, relentless fever's prey, Stretch'd on his couch the youthful patient lay. Prepar'd to catch the spirit's parting sigh, And raise the wailing of the funeral cry, Around his bed friends, kinsmen, servants stand, Mark the pale lips, glaz'd eye, and burning hand; Tell each faint flutter, as the moments past, Faint and more faint, and think that each will be the last. But what their transport! what their deep surprise! Light in a moment kindles in his eyes: His livid lip resumes its roseate hue; And the warm blood, as well-tun'd musick true, Beats calm and strong. O'erjoy'd, o'eraw'd, they see The work surpassing nature's energy: The effect they note: but none perceives or knows How that effect is wrought, or whence the blessing flows. The self-same hour, which saw the fever quell'd Forsake the son, the anxious sire beheld In Cana far away. There had he pray'd The Lord of Life his dying child to aid: There heard the Lord's rebuke, âExcept ye see Signs and strange portents, ye believe not me:â And there in bitterness of grief had said, âMake haste, O Lord, to come, or ere my son be dead.â That self-same moment heard the Saviour say, âThy son is living: rise, and go thy way.â He rose; the word believ'd; his way he went; Till, homeward journeying, on the mountain's bent âThy son is livingâ met in sounds of joy His raptur'd ear; and soon his darling boy He clasp'd, like Isaac, from the grave receiv'd, And in the Saviour's truth he and his house believ'd. 'Tis sweet, but mix'd with sadness, to behold The agreeing faith of that domestick fold: Sweet to behold all those, whom God hath join'd In one abode, in one pure faith combin'd; But sad the thought, amid those works of might, Which spoke the fulness of paternal right, Of unbelief how wide the deluge spread, And call'd destruction down on proud Capernaum's head. I marvel not, that when the father heard The clear fulfilment of the Saviour's word, The hope, tho' mingled with misgivings weak, Which bade him aid in distant Cana seek, To Christian faith by quick gradation grew; Fast fix'd on Him, whose will by proof he knew O'er space and time supreme, and instant death, The sinking frame to raise, and stay the fleeting breath. Nor marvel I, that he, who felt his heart By truth enlighten'd, should the bliss impart To his lov'd household; or that they, whose eyes Beheld, as from the sepulchre, arise Disease's victim, and in health rejoice, Rous'd by the touch of that electrick voice; Should to the father's creed their suffrage yield, And nature's Lord avow, who nature's power could wield. 'Twere marvel more, save that the human mind, By passion weak, by prepossession blind, Perverse, and wedded to the deeds of night, Rejects the day-spring of unwelcome light; 'Twere marvel thou, Capernaum, wouldst not see Whence came the mighty wonders wrought in thee; But choose thy portion in the threaten'd âwoe,â Thy harden'd heart denounc'd, thy reckless pride laid low. Low art thou laid! Along Gennesaret's shore The curious pilgrim marks thy site no more, Unless perchance some lonely sheds may claim The sad memorial of thy vaunted name. That name meanwhile the Saviour's sacred page From clime to clime transmits, from age to age, Presumption's check, to warn the startled sense 'Gainst wilful unbelief, and hard impenitence. Nor less, thy inmate in those guilty days, That page the ânoble courtier'sâ faith portrays; That he, who reads the tale, therein may read, He and his house, their duty and their meed: See signs and portents stamp Messiah's claim; Perceive his might, at hand, afar, the same; And mark how faith, by prompt obedience shewn, The approving Saviour loves with gifts of health to own. Lord, may I still, howe'er remote thou seem, In danger's hour at hand thy presence deem; Still at thy feet in faith my sorrows lay, Thy pow'r acknowledge, and thy will obey; Still in thy works of daily bounty prove The signs and wonders of preserving love; Escape the unbeliever's threaten'd woe, I and my house, and Thee our Lord and Saviour know! THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THE POOR. Luke iv. 16â18. âArt thou the Messiah, the Prophet to come? Or wait we another to see?ââ âMy works be my answer: and blest is his doom, Who shall not be offended in me. The deaf have their hearing, the sightless their eyes, The dumb have recover'd their speech; The lepers are cleansed; the lifeless arise; To the poor the glad voice of the Gospel I preach.â The Gospel is preach'd, it is preach'd to the poor: So the Lord by his Spirit foretold; When visions of beauty in prospect before The eyes of his seer were unroll'd: âThen for them, who in prison and heaviness pined, Oil of gladness, like rivers, should flow; On their temples for ashes be diadems twined, And the garments of praise for the spirit of woe.â The Gospel is preach'd, it is preach'd to the poor; In Nazareth's synagogue shewn, When God by his Spirit first open'd the door For the tidings proclaim'd by his Son. There first He proclaim'd the good tidings of grace, Inroll'd in the book of the Seer; And declar'd, whilst each eye was fast fix'd on his face, âThis day is this Scripture fulfill'd in your ear.â The Gospel He preach'd to the poor of the earth, Who this world's delights never knew; Hard penury frown'd on the day of their birth, And a gloom o'er their pilgrimage threw: In the lap of unlearned obscurity born, At the bosom of indigence nurst; The high-minded Pharisee held them in scorn, The Rabbi of Israel call'd them accurst. But weak as they were and ignoble, He taught That their Father's affection they share; And represt the inordinate workings of thought, While He told of âthe fowls of the air:â He spake of the wretched, who patiently âmourn,â And with âcomfortâ hereafter are âblest;â And of children of woe, who âby angels are borneâ From the hovel of want to the mansions of rest. The Gospel He preach'd to the poor, who were weigh'd Hard down by the burden of grief; âIn spirit the poor,â on whose consciences prey'd A sickness, which baffled relief: Not such as stand far from their fellows apart, The Pharisee's merits advance, Thank God for their goodness in pride of their heart, And on self-humbled sinners look scornful askance: But those, who their breasts with sincerity beat, Alive to the evil within, With the penitent publican pardon entreat, âHave mercy, O God, on my sin:â âTo me,â thus the Saviour invited them, âturn, Ye travailers, heavily prest; My lesson of meekness and lowliness learn, Submit to my yoke, and your souls shall have rest.â Thus âwent He about doing goodâ day by day, Bidding mourning and heaviness cease; And still, as He went, to the poor by the way He preach'd the glad tidings of peace: Nor more worthy the Godhead his marvels appear, Which bade the vex'd body be whole, Than to âpublish Jehovah's acceptable year,â And âbind up the wounds of the broken in soul.â The scene of his marvellous works is gone by, The senses perceive them no more; But the voice of the Saviour still utters its cry, And the Gospel speaks home to the poor. Of worldly distinctions and pleasures bereft, 'Mid penury, labour, and care, They list to the words which âthe Anointedâ has left; And they know in their hearts, that his blessing they share. Nor less they in spirit who inwardly bleed, Where conscience has buried its dart, And points the rash word, the intemperate deed, The deep-seated plague of the heart: They too of the Gospel, still mighty to heal, Still list to the encouraging voice, O'er their soul feel the breath of the Comforter steal, And in hope of the promis'd salvation rejoice. Yes, the Prophet to come, the Messiah, art thou! When with man thou didst sojourn of yore, Thy word, which made nature submissively bow, To the senses its evidence bore: At once to the sight, to the hearing, it told The presence of glory divine, And still in thy volume portray'd we behold, Tho' less brightly the features of Deity shine: But the word, which the soul of her blessedness tells, In its energy knows no decrease; The heart of the poor at its ministry swells, At the voice of the Gospel of peace: To that Gospel a voice from within them replies, Not heard by mortality's ear; But wing'd by the Spirit its whispers arise, And thou hear'st it acknowledge, that Christ has been here. THE DRAUGHT OF FISHES. Luke v. 1â11. Clear as a crystal mirrour, in the beam Of morn, Tiberias' lake expanded lay, As clear and smooth: save where old Jordan's stream Mark'd thro' that mirrour clear his dimpled way. The mist, that spread a shadowy veil, at length Slow up the mountain's side its skirts hath roll'd; And see the sun, rejoicing in his strength, Now tip the rocks, now spread the lake with gold, His sparkling rays on rich Bethsaida fling, And light Capernaum's tow'rs, tall palms, and limpid spring. But on Capernaum's spring, Bethsaida's towers, And fair Tiberias' lake, another Sun Must pour the splendour of his morning hours. Heard ye the Prophet's voice? âFrom Zabulun And Naphtali, hard by the northern sea, Where Jordan eastward laves Gennesaret's plain, And Gentiles throng the coasts of Galilee, Sunk in the depth of night's chaotick reign; Shall morning dawn on them who sate in gloom, And springing light the shade of death's dark vale illume.â An humble man is teaching on the strand: His garb, his mien, his voice bespeak Him one Of northern Israel's children, such as stand In crowds around, to mute attention won. And there from toil, yet heedful of his speech, Five fishers rest the sandy sea beside; Their shallops drawn upon the pebbly beach, Their nets fresh wash'd by morning's breath are dried. In lusty manhood three: but one appears A sire of hoary head, and one of greener years. The gathering crowd intent the Teacher throng: âPush from the shore,â He says, as on the boat Sedate He treads; there seated, from his tongue Smooth o'er the unruffled lake his accents float. How clear that lake unruffled sleeps beside! How bright above Him gleams yon azure arch! How strong the shafts of light, which in his pride The sun shoots forth on his ascending march! But lake, nor heav'n, nor sun ascending high, In clearness, brightness, strength, may with that Teacher vie. Hush'd is his tongue: but still all listening seem The speechless crowd, and still all fix'd remain: As if, entranc'd by some enchanting dream, They woke unwilling, and would sleep again. But hark, he speaks: âNow launch into the deep, And for a draught straight let the nets be thrown.â âAll night,â a voice replies, ânor rest nor sleep, But all in vain, our eyes and limbs have known: In fruitless toil the fishing hours are past: But at thy bidding, Lord, the net shall still be cast.â Why was it, Peter, that that humble man, Could o'er thy actions with a word prevail? Was it, that, ere the Saviour's course began, Thou in Bethabara heard'st the Baptist's hail, âBehold the Lamb of God;â and so didst go, Led by thy brother, now thy boat-compeer, To seek Messiah in his dwelling low, And from his lips thy name, O Cephas, hear? Was it, that thou didst see in Cana shine His glory first reveal'd, the water turn'd to wine? Was it perchance, that to thy mind had come, In Judah, in Samaria, what befell, What might his acts display'd in Salem's dome, His words what eloquence by Sychar's well? Was it, thine eyes had seen, thine ears had heard, How from the courtier's son affliction fled, What time, in Cana spoke, the healing word In far Capernaum smooth'd the patient's bed? Was it, thine own Bethsaida too had felt, Thro' Galilean lands the pow'r his Spirit dealt? Was it, once more when that benignant face, Those lips of wisdom, met thine ear, thy ken, Those lips o'erflowing with celestial grace, That face more lovely than the sons of men; His morning words, with truth unearthly fraught, Stamp'd on his human form a heav'nly sign, And in thy pondering soul awak'd the thought Of pow'r to match that eloquence divine, And bade thee feel, 'twas his at will to sway, 'Twas thine his will to hear, to reverence, and obey? Howe'er it be, thy hand his voice obey'd. The net is cast: how to be rais'd again? Now put forth all thy strength, and call in aid Thy comrades yonder: quick they come, they strain, The draught to lift; but not for thee, for all, The yielding nets the captive spoil can hold: The boats are sinking. Now I see thee fall Low at the Master's feet, his knees infold; And, while each soul partakes thy terror, cry, âDepart from me, O Lord; a sinful man am I.â Forego thy terror! True: the power divine Is here; and who shall see his God, and live? True: sinfulness, unworthiness is thine; And who shall prosper, if his God shall give Naught but his merits? But the piercing ray Of Heav'n's effulgence human flesh shall veil, And pitying love too rigorous justice stay; So mayst thou gaze unblench'd, and hear him hail Thee and thy fellows with a brother's love, If ye to his commands, tho' weak, will faithful prove. And hark, he bids you in his footsteps go, And leave the precincts of your native lake, Your friends, your calling; far and wide to throw The Gospel net, and he of you will make âFishers of men:â that net, so widely thrown, Shall grasp of every kind, both bad and good, Like the great draught ev'n now before you strown, Of every kind a mighty multitude; Till, cull'd and sever'd in the final day, The good apart be stor'd, the bad be cast away. Go then, and follow gladly. Leave your all, Thou and thy brother Andrew first; and ye, Your father leave, obedient to His call Your Lord and Master, sons of Zebedee! Ye see his pow'r, his glory: as the sun Shines o'er the rocks and clothes the lake with gold, So shall the wondrous work this morning done To the world's sight a brighter sun unfold; When forth his chosen heralds ye shall go, And what your eyes have seen, your tongues abroad shall shew. Then these, and things like these, shall ye proclaim, Despite of insults, injuries, and death; Like wonders ye shall work in Jesus' name, For Jesus' name shall ye resign your breath. The simple mind, the honest heart and good, The purpose worthy heav'n, mankind shall view, The witness borne thro' perils, woes, and blood; And own, with praise to God, his servants true. But hold! the Master takes his homeward way; Your hand is on the plough: behoves you not to stay. THE LEPER. Mark i. 40â42; Luke v. 12, 13. âIf thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me, Lord!â The leper spake, as Jesus near him drew; And, while his lips gave utterance to the word, His knees he bent, his suppliant body threw Prone on the ground, and prostrate there implor'd The grace of Him whose potency he knew. The face, the form, the attitude beseech, Mute, but with all the eloquence of speech, And, where compassion dwells, the Saviour's bosom reach. The Saviour hears; and beaming heavenly mild, Mild as the light which summer evenings pour On some forsaken ruin, misery's child He eyes; he lifts his hand; and bending o'er, He touches him from human haunts exil'd, Whom friendly hand had durst not touch before. And so with aspect kind, and pitying mien, How sweet to him by whom so long unseen, And gentle voice replies, âI'm willing, be thou clean!â Clean, from what plague? Is it not that whose root Deep in the inmost frame its hold maintains; And, thence expanding, bids its venom shoot Wide o'er the snow-white skin in boils and blains, Till, lo, from crown of head to sole of foot, O'er all the man the foul contagion reigns; Disdaining cure to life's extremest verge, That none but God omnipotent can purge The deep and dread disease, and quell that loathsome scourge? And can the breath of one of human race, A touch, a word, the index of his will, From the heart's blood that close corruption chase? As well it were, by dint of human skill, To pluck yon mountain from his rocky base, And with the pile the hollow valley fill. Mark then the event! âBe clean,â the Saviour said: The word is spoken, and the will obey'd; Behold, the leper clean, the leprosy is fled. Veil'd in his form, who made the leper clean, I hail the beam of sempiternal light: And deem, tho' earth-born shadows intervene, To cloud the brightness of paternal might, To him, who thus, in human semblance seen, Could claim his own hereditary right, Still should the voice be rais'd, the knee be bent; The form express of God omnipotent, Him from the throne of God on mercy's mission sent. And what tho' scant beneath our northern sky Its sway the leper's dread disease maintains, Is there not still a deadly leprosy, Which eats the flesh and curdles in the veins, And, scorning man's attempts at mastery, Wide and more wide with force resistless reigns? And shall not he, that leprosy of sin Who feels far spread and rankling deep within, Despairing earthly aid, celestial seek to win? âIf thou be willing, thou canst heal me, Lord!â Now, as of old, thou heart-struck mourner cry! By sin polluted, and of God abhorr'd, A helpless outcast, whither canst thou fly? To Him, whom erst that leprous man ador'd, Submissive fall, before him prostrate lie: Vain hast thou learn'd all human aid to feel; Thou know'st that none, save God alone, can heal; Then haste, the Saviour seek, and at his footstool kneel! With ready might, with answering will to aid, Now, as of old, the Saviour makes reply. He hears, he sees, before his throne display'd The meek petition, and the suppliant eye. The scepter'd hand of Majesty, array'd In glory, next the Holy One and High, He stretches forth, in faith's bright vision seen, Where aye he dwells the Cherubim between, And with compassion says, âI will it, be thou clean!â Blest is the man, tho' sick with mortal taint, Who knows the secret of his heart's disease! Blest is the man, beneath his burden faint, Who, where the fountain of his sorrow, sees! Blest, who, in spite of nature's fond constraint, From impotence of human succour flees; And seeks repose and healing, where combin'd, In glory's radiant tabernacle shrin'd, Dominion arms the hand, and goodness fills the mind! O Jesus, bountiful as strong to save, For mercy as for mightiness ador'd; O give me grace thy healing pow'r to crave, âIf thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me, Lord!â Thy pity ne'er a ruthless answer gave, In lowly fervency of heart implor'd. Ne'er wilt thou spurn the sinner's contrite soul, Ne'er see unmov'd the tears of anguish roll, But gracious still reply, âI will it, be thou whole!â THE PARALYTICK. Mark ii. 1â12. Luke v. 17â26. It is a form, earth scarce can own: So motionless the body lies, So dull the cheek, and wan as stone, So stiff the lip, so sunk the eyes; Should seem the charnel-house might claim To be the dwelling of that frame; Or that the corse were buried there, And forth the spectre come this upper world to scare. Why do ye that decrepit load This way upon your shoulders bear? Why turn, and quit the houseward road? Why pass the gate, why climb the stair? Why from the multitude aloof Mount ye above the terraced roof? Why thence a glance inquiring throw On that assembled press, as seeking one below? There the throng'd court a gathering fills, From distance in Capernaum met; From Salem's tow'rs, from Judah's hills, From thy fair towns, Gennesaret. Law-learned Scribes ye there may see: And there the lordly Pharisee; His robe a deeper fringe confines, And on his scornful brow the broad phylactery shines. And there is He, for whom are come The crowd which throngs the obstructed door, To see him in his lowly home, His hand to feel, to hear his lore: He whom your anxious glances seek, Of lowly guise, in spirit meek, Whose presence brings to human sight The life and light of men, the Lord's incarnate might. Quick, ere the fainting patient die, The o'ershadowing canopy remove; Quick to the couch the cords apply, And fit them in the guiding groove: Now 'mid the opening crowd below, As up their wondering eyes they throw, Down let the bed descending glide, And lay the palsied man the Saviour's place beside. âCheer thee, my son!â the Saviour says, And, smiling, eyes the sick man's bed: So have I seen the sun's warm rays Smile on the pimpernel's weak head; Its stem revives, its flow'rs expand, Warm'd by the genial influence bland. âCheer thee, my son;â the King of heaven With radiant smile proclaims, âThy sins are thee forgiven!â âWho thus blasphemes? Who pardons sin, Save God alone?â With malice fraught, The law's proud Rabbis thus within Their breasts conceive the secret thought. The secret thought the Saviour spies. âWhy reason thus?â aloud he cries; âWhich were the easier word to say, Thy sins are thee forgiven, or, Rise and go thy way? âBut doubt ye, if, in sorrow's hour, The Son of man, who came to heal, Possess on earth the pardoning power? If such the doubt your spirits feel, Rise!ââto the palsied man he said: âRise thou, and take with thee thy bed, And go:ââthe bed whereon he lay He rose and took, and went rejoicing on his way. Now to the test, proud Pharisee, Behold at once thy scruples brought: Now, Israel's teacher, mark and see Disprov'd at once thy captious thought. 'Tis God alone can pardon sin: 'Tis God alone the palm can win O'er sufferings on the sinner thrown, Can bid affliction go, and lo! affliction gone! Fain would I see thee turn, and own, Who heals disease, can sin forgive: Fain hear thee say, that One alone Can bid both soul and body live.â But blindness seals thy self-clos'd eyes, And on thy heart self-harden'd lies; Lest there the heav'n-sent light should shine, And faith, and faith's appeal, and faith's reward be thine. Else hadst thou join'd the palsied man, Who on his way with praises went; Else join'd the crowd, who straight began To give in praise their wonder vent: Else hadst thou wisdom's lesson learn'd; The Worker in his work discern'd; And seen, and hail'd, in one combin'd, The Healer of the sick, the Saviour of mankind. Alas, that prejudice should spread So thick a curtain o'er the mind! In vain does God the day-spring shed, To light and lead the wilful blind. Not the chill palsy's torpid prey, More senseless of its rays than they: Not the dead tenants of the tomb, Nor, fair to outward view, that house of sunless gloom. O Thou, who giv'st thy servant light, Grant that its heavenly rays may shine On thoughts dispos'd to view them right, And bless their origin divine! So may my soul, from error free, Walk in the cheering beams, and see In each disease, by Jesus heal'd, The Pardoner of her sins, her God in man reveal'd! THE INFIRM MAN AT BETHESDA. John v. 1â15. âHow dar'st thou profane by thy labour the rest, Which Israel's lawgiver hallow'd and blest? How treat the decree of the prophet with scorn, On the Sabbath thy load thro' Jerusalem borne?ââ Thus the Jews into wrath at the passenger broke: Thus mildly in answer the passenger spoke. âBy the Pool of Bethesda, (O, blest be the name, Which with reason that mansion of mercy may claim!) By the Pool of Bethesda a cripple I lay; And beside, where its arches o'ershadow the way, A crowd of the wither'd, the blind, and the lame, Akin our afflictions, our wishes the same. âFor at seasons, as oft hath Jerusalem seen, The pool is disturb'd from its surface serene; An angel, as erst in our days of renown, Comes, 'tis said, on that merciful ministry down; And the son of affliction, the first who can lave, Rises active and strong from the health-giving wave. âThree years past the half of mortality's span, The threescore and ten now allotted to man, Have witness'd my sorrows; and still by the side Of the pool have I linger'd, and anxiously eyed The face of the water, and still o'er the brim On each motion drew forward my impotent limb. âBut diseas'd as I was, and all destitute too, Unassisted, unfriended, ah! what could I do? Or ere my weak frame to the water could creep, Some happier rival had taken the leap, And left me to pine, as he bounded away, Still to sickness and hope disappointed a prey. âBut ev'n now, while benignity beam'd in his eye, Thro' the porticoed passage a stranger drew nigh; And kindly he ask'd if I wish'd for relief; And I told him my tale of disaster and grief; And, âRise, take thy couch, and go homeward,â he said; And I rose, and I go, and I carry my bed. âHe hath said of my body, âBehold, thou art whole:â He hath spoken the language of peace to my soul, âSin no more, lest a greater affliction thou bear:â His might I acknowledge; and how shall I err, If to Him, who can nature's infirmities sway, My will I surrender, his mandate obey?â The accusers are answer'd: the accused is clear: The record remains, leaving sweet on the ear The name of Bethesda, which brings to the mind The Lord of the Sabbath, the Health of mankind, The Resource of the weak in abandonment's hour, The Dispenser of mercy, the Wielder of pow'r. The pool of Bethesda is broken and dry, In ruins its arches and porticoes lie; And Siloa's brook, which wont softly to go From the mountain of God to the basin below, To the eye of the pilgrim uncertainly shews The spot where âthe Mansion of Mercyâ arose. But a Salem there is, where the streams of the flood Still continue to flow from the mountain of God: Where a mansion of mercy each patient invites, And a pool of Bethesda each comer delights; And the weak, and the wither'd, the halt, and the blind, Who seek for a refuge, a refuge may find. Not one, here and there, now and then, is reliev'd; All who suffer, are call'd; all who come, are receiv'd: On the pool, lo! the Angel his virtue has shed, He who order'd the impotent man from his bed: Disease at the voice of his summoning flies, And the sick, when he bids them be healed, arise. That house of relief is the Church of his grace, On Apostles and Prophets is rested its base, Compact with the blood which his martyrs have shed, And Himself of the corner the strength and the head; God there thro' his Spirit takes pleasure to dwell, Nor prosper against it the portals of hell. That pool, rich in health, is the life-giving fount, Which the Spirit pours forth from the foot of the mount: The bath, where his children are wash'd from their stain; The well, which they drink from, and thirst not again; The well-water'd soil, where, as trees by the spring, In its season their fruit to perfection they bring. That house be my dwelling, that pool my retreat, In a world where corruption hath planted her seat; My cleanser from guilt, my protector from sin, My shield from temptation without and within; Thro' the dear might of him, who can say to the soul, âArise, and go forward: behold, thou art whole!â Till another Jerusalem gladden my sight, Where God's glory in visible splendour shall light; And another Bethesda enliven the scene, Where God his pavilion shall 'stablish with men; Who, with robes in the blood of the Sinless made white, Shall serve in his temple by day and by night. Nor sin, nor defilement, nor sickness, nor care, But sanctity pure, bliss unmingled, are there: There clear, as the crystal's transparency, flows The river of life thro' the groves of repose, Pour'd forth from the mount of the living I am, The throne everlasting of God and the Lamb. THE WITHERED HAND. Matt. xii. 9â14. Mark iii. 1â6. Luke vi. 6â11. Among Capernaum's children met To hear the word, be taught, and pray, Mid watchful foes was Jesus set; Beneath a cripple lay. âArise,â the Saviour gave command: âArise, stand forth, stretch out thine hand!â For nerveless and unstrung, As drooping by the cedar's side, Its verdure gone, its moisture dried, A scath'd and broken branch, the wither'd right hand hung. âStretch forth thy hand,â the Saviour said: No more: observant of command, The man the Saviour's word obey'd, And forth he stretch'd his hand. More quick than vernal swallow's flight, Or wing of viewless wind, or light Whose flash the sound outflies; The word is said, the deed is done: Life thro' the flagging veins hath run, And with its fellow's strength the palsied hand supplies. You look perchance to see the crowd In worship to the Saviour bend; You list to hear their voices loud Their Hallelujahs send: You think at once to hear them own, He, who such heavenly pow'r hath shewn, From heav'n his pow'r hath brought:â Ah! cast the baseless thought away; For on the Sabbath's holy-day That heavenly pow'r was shewn, that work of wonder wrought. With other thoughts around the crowd His mournful eye the Saviour threw: For their dim minds how thick a shroud Of darkness veil'd he knew. Fain had he seen some little spark Of faith illume those shadows dark, Tho' with a glowworm light: But, no! his mournful eye descried The bitterness of wounded pride, Inveterate malice deep, and murderous mad despite. Yes, the learn'd teachers of the law He knew what prejudice possest; And what the inward thoughts he saw Of the proud Rabbi's breast. And how the shade of wilful night Flings o'er the fairest scene of light Its dark discolouring hues; And how with keen malignant glance They eyed his heav'nly deeds askance, If aught of doubtful stamp might his fair fame accuse. And when that crippled man he drew Forth 'mid the gazing crowd to stand, And bade him in the publick view Stretch forth his wither'd hand; Their harden'd hearts as he beheld, His soul with deep emotions swell'd Of anger and of grief; That they, who from the pit releas'd On the sev'nth day their fallen beast, Should grudge the self-same day their fellow man's relief. True, 'twas Jehovah's sov'reign will On the sev'nth day his seal imprest; And bade the sons of men be still, And keep his holy rest. When from creation's work he stay'd, That day of weekly pause he bade His work's memorial be; And in the mirror of the rest, Which then he sanctified and blest, Will'd that of God's repose an image man might see. And when on Sinai's burning crown, 'Mid thunder's roar and lightning's glare, In fire and smoke the Lord came down, While Israel quak'd from far: That law primeval of mankind He on his chosen flock enjoin'd, Grav'd by himself on stone; Charg'd them the solemn rest to hold, Deep in their mindful hearts-enroll'd; Gave the six days to work, and stamp'd the sev'nth his own. But say to keep that holy rest Was man by his Creator made? Or was that Sabbath season blest For man's delight and aid? And what forbids, that He who came, Invested with the human frame, But arm'd with pow'r to sway, Howe'er he will'd, creation's plan, Should, for the benefit of man, Supreme dominion use o'er God's high holy-day? Then ask not, men of legal lore, Ye who with sanctimonious pride Of God's own kingdom close the door, The key of knowledge hide: Ask not, what day the Saviour chose, To cause in aid of human woes His healing rays to shine; But ask, what deeds the Saviour wrought; If with celestial symptoms fraught, If breathing love for man, and worthy pow'r divine. The wither'd hand, outstretch'd and sound; The pallid form, which dropsy held As in relentless fetters bound, Releas'd, its tyrant quell'd; She, whom for eighteen years of woe Satanick pow'r constrain'd to go With body bow'd and bent, Rous'd in the twinkling of an eye With shape erect to glorify, Touch'd by the Saviour's hand, God's pow'r omnipotent: To sense what say they, but that He, From whom such marvels flow'd, may claim A more than prophet's dignity, A more than prophet's name. That He, o'er ills which man molest, His will by word, by touch, exprest, Who wields Jehovah's rod, Ev'n tho' on God's high holy-day He exercise his sov'reign sway, Stands forth in human form reveal'd the Son of God? â 'Twas he, who our diseases bore;â Thus in the volume of his book His seer had prophesied of yore; âHe who our sorrows took.â And he hath taught us, how we best May sanctify his day of rest, When, at his Father's shrine Our debt of worship duly paid, We seek our brethren's wants to aid, And by good deeds to man adorn the name divine. Lord of the Sabbath, led by thee Such day of rest I fain would view: That first pure-hearted piety May bear dominion due, Secure from worldly cares and strife; Next the sweet charities of life May unreprov'd prevail: Type of the Sabbath, which remains For God's belov'd, where ever reigns Devotion's spirit meek with love that ne'er shall fail. THE ROMAN CENTURION. Matt. viii. 5â13. Luke vii. 1â10. Stately the form, that paced with brass-shod feet, And legs in iron clasp'd, Capernaum's street. His helmed head with crimson horse-hair grac'd, In scaly mail his manly body cas'd, Save that beneath appear'd the sinewy knee; Erect his mien, his step was firm and free: This hand a lance, that grasp'd a vine-branch wand, Rome, thy centurion's badge, and ensign of command. But tho', proud Rome, thy legions' garb he wears, His bosom fosters other hopes than theirs: And tho' to thee he pays the soldier's vow, At other shrine his knee is pledg'd to bow. No gods of thine his soul's allegiance prove, Quirinal Mars, or Capitolian Jove; Nor feast to him nor rite of thine is dear, PÃ¦an, or Salian dance, or garland-crowned steer. For he has learn'd, a votary pure, to wait Within the precincts of thy temple gate, City of God Eternal! and his hands, In bounty stretch'd to Galilean lands, Have rais'd a holy house for rites divine: Nor other offering pays he at the shrine, Nor other name in worship deigns to own, But Israel's God, the High and Holy One alone. And he has learn'd from many a vision old, In the long scroll of Israel's seers inroll'd, How from Judea's race despis'd should spring The world's great Sovereign, and of kings the King. And he has mark'd the heir of David's throne, Confirm'd by marvels, as in visions shewn; Has seen the promis'd Rod of Israel rise, And Judah's Morning Star shine forth 'mid error's skies. That Rod to worship, and that Star adore, His might acknowledge, and his aid implore, Forth comes he now, prepar'd with pray'rs to meet The Saviour passing thro' Capernaum's street. Not for himself that sovereign aid he needs, Not for himself the generous soldier pleads; While thus, with lowliness of heart and tone, He makes to willing ears his wish benignant known. âLord, on his bed my suffering servant lies: His frame unnerv'd convulsive palsy tries; And death, as o'er his prey some haughty foe, Has pois'd his spear, and stands prepar'd to throw. For him thy help I crave: but long have stay'd, Or ere I dar'd to supplicate thy aid, For, ah! unworthy I to thee to come, And all unworthy now to call thee to my home. THE WIDOW'S SON. Luke vii. 11â17. Yield the way, give ample space; Lo, it comes thro' NaÃ¯n's gate: Give the sad procession place, Moving in funereal state. There, in Death's attire array'd, One in prime of youth is laid: And a mournful matron near Paces by the burial bier. With maternal anguish wild, In affliction's darkest mood, 'Tis the mother mourns her child, Reft from her in widowhood. 'Tis the mother mourns her son, Him her last and only one: Well may she her sorrow rue, Husbandless, and childless too! Many a lonely year of grief, Thro' the livelong night and day, He has been her sole relief, He has been her only stay. What of joy her heart has known, Center'd all in him alone; Parent, husband, daughter, son, All together wrapt in one. All surviv'd in him alone, All in him alone are dead! In one ruin overthrown, Life's last charities are fled. What, alas! is left for her, But in yonder sepulchre, Where her earthly hope shall lie, There to lay her down and die? âWeep not!â Hark, a voice I hear Issuing from another throng, Which to NaÃ¯n's city near Moves Capernaum's road along. There is one of gentle mien, Who, on yon funereal scene Gazing with benignant eyes, âWeep not,â to the mourner cries. Who is he that boldly bids Tears of grief their station keep, Pent within the bursting lids? 'Twere as easy task from sleep To recall that corpse again; And along the blacken'd vein Bid, with renovated glow, Life's empurpled current flow. 'Twere as easy!âLo, a hand Softly rests upon the bier! Still the attentive bearers stand. Hark, again the voice I hear: âYouth, I say to thee, arise!â Quickly as the mandate flies, Fresh with life the nerves are strung, Beam the eyes, and speaks the tongue. Now, lorn mother, weep no more: Or, if starting to the eye Tears will thence spontaneous pour, Be they tears of ecstasy! In thy desolate embrace See the kind Deliverer place Him, whom he from death hath won; Him, thy dead, thy living son! Take him, he is thine again! Let him to thy bosom grow, There thy child with transport strain, Such as thou alone canst know. There the silent thoughts that swell To the Saviour's eye shall tell, More than language can express, All thy depth of thankfulness. We meanwhile, whose lighter heart Less o'erwhelming joys possess, We will bear a louder part, And thy Benefactor bless. Blessings on our Prophet light! Hail his deed of love and might! Blest be he whom God hath sent! Praise to God Omnipotent! So from distant Galilee Shall the glorious tidings sound; Tabor's mount, Tiberias' sea, Hence shall spread the marvel round. Judah's hills shall hear the tale; And her towns our Prophet hail, At whose bidding sorrow flies, Death is foil'd, the dead arise! THE WOMAN WHICH WAS A SINNER. Luke vii. 36â50 Who is she, a self-call'd guest, Who, reclin'd as Jesus lies, In NaÃ¯n's town, at Simon's feast, Feels her heart's deep yearnings rise? Who with tears, and flowing hair, And with unguent rich and rare, Pour'd from box of onyx stone, Makes her heart's deep yearnings known? Where the Saviour lies reclin'd, Lo, that woman's form appears; Bending o'er him from behind, Lo, she wets his feet with tears, Streaming from her o'ercharg'd eyes; With her hair the moisture dries; Prints with many a kiss his feet; Bathes them with that unguent sweet. Is it she, the Magdalene, From the sevenfold tyranny Of demoniack frenzy clean? Is it she of Bethany?â Thus we deem not: but we know, Great has been her cause of woe; Well we know, whate'er her name, Great has been her cause of shame. âShe the way of sin hath trod: She a child of guilt hath been. And shall he, a man of God, Offering take from hands unclean? He, whose high pretensions claim To assume a prophet's name, If a prophet, he would know, Who is she that clasps him so.â Thou, that with the social feast Spread'st thy board, O Pharisee; And hast bid the prophet guest, Simon, to regale with thee; As thine eye the scene surveys, Tho' thy thoughts no word betrays, Are not these the thoughts that find Welcome in thy secret mind? Is it thus? Then what if He, Who assumes a prophet's name, Give thee cause at once to see Proof of his aspiring claim? What if He at once disclose, He full well that woman knows? What if He thy heart reveal? What if He her pardon seal? âHear me, Simon!â Thus his speech Wakes thee from suspicion's dream: Fain would He thy spirit teach, Worthier things of Him to deem. âDebts to one, of lot more blest, Two of Israel's sons distrest: This a lighter burden ow'd; That bemoan'd a tenfold load. âHow to quit the engagement due? How from worse themselves to save? He of each the trouble knew, And to each the debt forgave. Which of them to him will pay Love more fervent? Will not, say, He in gratitude excel, Whom the greater boon befel? âMark this woman! For my feet Water none thy house supplied: She with tears my feet hath wet, With her tresses she hath dried! Kiss, my welcome to bespeak, None thou gavest on my cheek: She, thou seest it, doth not miss, Since she came, my feet to kiss! âOil of olive hast thou none Given me to anoint my head: Unguent from sweet spices won She upon my feet hath shed! Manifold her sins have been: Now forgiveness makes her clean. Mercy great 'tis hers to prove; Like the mercy, great her love!â Simon, art thou answer'd so? Seek thy scruples more than this? Does not he, the Teacher, know, Who and what that woman is? Tho' with former sin defil'd, Now repentant sorrow's child, Shall her touch annul his claim To a prophet's holy name? Simon, art thou answer'd now? Yet another lesson taught, Pharisee, the truth avow! He, who reads and tells the thought, Not by tongue of man exprest, Lurking in the inmost breast, May not He a title claim Loftier than a prophet's name? Simon, art thou answer'd yet? Still another lesson know! He, who, heedful of the debt, Which to God transgressors owe, Solaces the conscious heart, And to sinners dares impart Pardon by his own decree, Is not more than prophet He? Take then thou that woman's place; Humbled in thine own conceit, Pharisee, thyself abase; Bend and clasp the Saviour's feet! Tell the plague thy heart within; Seek forgiveness of thy sin: Thou that woman's grace shalt prove; Thou shalt feel that woman's love! O, like her, the Saviour seek, O, to him thy heart be given; Thou, like her, shalt hear him speak âAll thy sins are thee forgiven!â Thou, like her, shalt hear him say, âRise, and go thy homeward way: Lo, thy faith hath caus'd to cease All thy troubles; go in peace.â THE TEMPEST STILLED. Matt. viii. 23â27. Mark iv. 35â41. Luke viii. 22â25. âPeaceâbe still!â the Saviour said, And mildly rais'd his pillow'd head, Wak'd by his followers' cry; As, fear-struck at the stormy deep, They rous'd him from his placid sleep; âLord, save us, or we die.â Smooth o'er Tiberias' sunny sea, The crystal lake of Galilee, The vessel held her way; While fearless, near the helm reclin'd, The lowly Saviour of mankind In soothing slumber lay. With slumber sweet and deep he slept, (Their vigils unseen angels kept,) When down the mountain-steep The winds a sudden tempest pour; Around the beating surges roar, And o'er the shallop sweep. âPeaceâbe still!â the Saviour said: Rebuk'd, the winds and sea obey'd, Submissive to his will; Gently as on its mother's breast The tender nursling sinks to rest; And all was smooth and still. âWhat man is this? what more than man,â The rescued train o'erpower'd began With awe and glad surprise, âWhose voice the winds and waves obey?â Thus wonder gave her feelings way, And reason thus replies. Ask, who of yore with potent hand, Threw round the sea a wall of sand; And to its billows said, âThus far advance thy waves, O sea; This thy perpetual boundary be; And here thy pride be stay'd!â Ask, who of yore a place assign'd, A dwelling for the viewless wind, His treasure-house for war; And taught the swift-wing'd storms to know, Their season when abroad to blow, And when their blasts to spare. Then mark him here, in pow'r the same! The human soul, the human frame, To nature's frailty heir, And prone at nature's call to steep The senses in refreshing sleep, His human race declare. Nor less the mild majestick word, At once by winds and billows heard, Of conscious might the sign, And the deep calm o'er nature flung, More clearly than an angel's tongue, Declare his race divine. Still on that word his Church relies, As thro' the world her course she plies, At sea and far from land: For oft, tho' all around be fair, Danger hangs brooding in the air, And storms are hard at hand. Then, Lord, to thee thy servants kneel; Their sorrows thou hast learn'd to feel, And thou canst hear their cry: O, in the fearful hour of ill, Say to the tempest, âPeace, be still!â âLord, save us, or we die.â THE GADARENE DEMONIACK. Mark v. 1â20. Luke viii. 26â39. Couch'd in the depth of yon sepulchral gloom, What shape is that of horror and dismay? Grim are the lifeless tenants of the tomb; But far more grim that living man than they. Uncloth'd, unhous'd, no pow'r can tame his mind; Fetters his limbs, nor manacles, can bind: 'Gainst all he meets his rage malignant burns, Till, lacking other scope, fierce on himself he turns. Ah, well the miserable man is known: Of earth-born, earth-bred plagues no victim he! Of passion wild, subverting reason's throne; Of moonstruck madness; vacant idiotcy: But of the angels, who rebellious fell From their first state, and since with darkness dwell, Left for a space at will on earth to roam, One on that man has seiz'd, and made the wretch his home. One, said I? one?âalas, as serried stand, Beneath the legionary eagle's shade, Cohort by cohort rang'd, and band by band, Him their abode have countless demons made. And so with startling shout, or fearful yell, Thro' den and cave, o'er mountain, rock, and fell, With hurried step the wild demoniack runs; Nor beetling cliff he heeds, or foaming torrent shuns. Oft has his frantick form surpris'd with fear, As wont his solitary range to take, On Gilead's heights the hardy mountaineer, Or the lone fisher on Tiberias' lake. Oft has his form by Gergesa been seen; Oft fill'd with dread the peaceful Gadarene; As in the tombs the sullen maniack lay, Or rush'd infuriate forth to seize his passing prey. Forbear thy terror, Gadara; and thou, Send, Gergesa, thy fearless children round. Ye, at his rage who trembled, see him now All cloth'd and harmless, seated on the ground. There see him taking on the ground his seat, All cloth'd and harmless, at the Saviour's feet: His foot hath found, like Noah's dove, its rest; For He hath still'd the storm which tempested his breast. His hand, from which the chains asunder fell, Moves unrestrain'd, nor deems mankind its foes: His ear, which started at his own fierce yell, Has heard the words of healing and repose: His burning eyes, which rested not, nor slept, With tears of gratitude and joy have wept: His lips the tones of praise and pray'r can raise, Pray'r to attend his Lord, to God for mercy praise. But where are his tormentors? Look, behold, Where, from the edge of that o'erhanging steep, Precipitous yon herd unclean is roll'd Sheer o'er the cliff, and plunges in the deep: Thither the fiends are gone. For when they saw Near to the tomb their great Destroyer draw; Impatient of his eye, the ruthless crew Before their Sovereign's feet the prostrate victim threw. They saw and trembled. Him the Son of God They own'd: they own'd his word's resistless power: Adjur'd him to suspend the penal rod, Nor antedate the dread, the torturing hour; Nor to the abyss at once of torment throw; But leave them forth at his command to go, There in that herd obscene a refuge find, And choose their fit abode in that forbidden kind. And they are gone. Now praise to Him, who cast Those spirits forth, and left the patient whole! He the vex'd body freed in ages past, 'Tis He who still must liberate the soul. There Moloch, blood-besmear'd, with fury wild, And Belial, flush'd with wine and lust-defil'd, Conflicting sway with lordly Baal hold, And Mammon brooding close o'er heaps of hoarded gold. There the arch-foe, with all the apostate host Of rebel fiends, whom in his train he drew, Makes of the kingdoms of the world his boast: But him with all his host shall Christ subdue. To break the sceptre, and destroy the throne Of that arch-foe, the Son of God was shewn: He saw like lightning, Satan fall from heaven. Lord of earth, hell, and sky, to Him be glory given! Praise to the Saviour! Praise to Him, whose will, Seen and unseen, creation's works obey! For Him the sea is calm, the winds are still, The buoyant waters smooth a level way. The lame have leap'd, exulting at his word: The blind have seen him; and the deaf have heard: The lepers worship; and the speechless tongue, By his command unloos'd, hath loud his praises sung. Thee Sickness hears, and rises from her bed: To thee Death listens from the charnel tomb: Unbodied spirits, who their home have fled, Come at thy bidding, and their post resume. Thou rul'st the princes of the unseen world; Thou from their seat th' usurping pow'rs hast hurl'd; Thy might they publish; on thy name they cry, âThe Holy One of God, the Son of God Most High!â THE DAUGHTER OF JAEIRUS. Matt. ix. 18, 19. 23â26. Mark v. 21â24; 35â43. Luke viii. 40â42. 49â56. At the Ruler's abode, in Capernaum's street, What has summon'd yon crowd of the people to meet? Has the voice of carousal attracted the throng; The voice of the viol, the voice of the song; The voice of the tabret, with dancing allied; The voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride? Is the bride in her nuptial apparel array'd? Do âthe virgins, her fellows,â encompass the maid? Are the lamps beaming bright with the festival blaze? On their child do the parents exultingly gaze, While a tear dims their eye from their lov'd one to part, Tho' they yield her with smiles to the spouse of her heart? Alas! 'tis no place for gay hearts to advance The voice in the carol, the step in the dance. No bridegroom is there, like the sun in his might, Rejoicing to start on his circle of light: No brightness the chamber of grief to illume: No bridal array, but the garb of the tomb. And there is lamenting, and mourning, and woe, For the blossom cut off, when beginning to blow. The minstrels are raising the funeral cry; And with wailing âthe virgins, her fellows,â reply; And the mother with ashes her head hath defil'd, And is rending her robe for the loss of her child. But where is the father? I see him not there, With his garment all rent, and besprinkled his hair. He is gone, while yet linger'd the flickering breath, Ere the arrow had flown from the angel of death; He is gone, on the wings of affection, for aid On the child of his bosom, his own little maid. And where does he seek it? To whom does he kneel, But to Him, who is gracious and mighty to heal? âOn the brink of the grave, lo! my daughter is laid, The child of my bosom, my own little maid. O hasten, O hasten, thy succour to give! If thy hand be laid on her, my daughter shall live!ââ âRise, father afflicted! the arrow is sped. Why trouble the Master? thy daughter is dead.ââ She is dead! Yet hope dances and beams in his eyes; For, unmov'd by the tidings, the Master replies, âFear not, for thy daughter thou yet shalt receive, If thy faith be unshaken! Fear not, but believe!â He has past, the kind Master, at once thro' the crowd, Thro' the mourners all weeping and wailing aloud: He has bid them forbear thus to wail and to weep, For the damsel's repose is the stillness of sleep: And their scoffs (for they knew it was death) he has borne, Incredulity's taunts, and the laughter of scorn. Now cheerly, O father, thy courage sustain; And thou, O fond mother, thy sorrow refrain. Behold, where He stands by the side of the bed, With his three lov'd disciples, intent on the dead: And he takes by the hand her pale form, as she lies; And serenely he calls to her, âMaiden, arise!â The maiden arises! Gaze, gaze, with delight; 'Tis no dream of the mind, no deceit of the sight. She arises, she walks! To your fondling embrace Take the joy of your home, the sole hope of your race: The song for her second nativity raise, And the funeral dirge change for anthems of praise. But stint not your praise to the blessings of earth; This day be the dawn of an heavenly birth! Be it yours, be it hers, in your prophets to read The Restorer of health for your Israel decreed! Be it yours, be it hers, Him, by prophets foretold, In your lov'd one's Restorer to life to behold! Let the mercy, which wrought her revival from death, Be your anchor of hope and your fortress of faith! Thus calm may ye pass thro' mortality's strife, Safe in Him, in whose hand are the issues of life: Thus pleas'd, when He bids, your last sleep may ye take: Thus blest, when He bids you arise, may ye wake: Thus again from the grave your lost daughter receive, When He comes, his last triumph o'er death to achieve: Re-united with her, see enraptur'd again The face of the merciful Healer of men; And present her to Him, 'mid the angels of heaven, âLo, we and the child whom thy mercy hath given!â THE DISEASED WOMAN. Matt. ix. 20â22; Mark v. 25â34; Luke viii. 43â48. Who, tho' with tongue of angels, could portray, His bosom glowing with a seraph's flame, What power supreme intabernacled lay Within the incarnate Godhead's lowly frame? Thence issuing forth essential virtue came, Dispensing health, whene'er his mandate bade: And thence, as if unbidden, to its aim It sprang, when faith with outstretch'd hand essay'd To touch the garment's hem, which that meek frame array'd. And tho' with angel's tongue and seraph's fire, Who the mild goodness in that frame inshrin'd Could paint with worthy colours; and aspire To trace the more than parent's love combin'd With pow'r supreme, which watch'd, with gentle wind To fan the rising flame of faint belief; To raise the bruis'd, the bleeding heart to bind, That meekly felt, but fear'd to speak, her grief, And long'd and sigh'd to find, but durst not ask relief? And who could paint that all-pervading eye, Which pierc'd the secrets of the soul; and say, If more of might and bounteous energy, Or more the incarnate Godhead's acts display, Of heavenly wisdom? Like the eye of day, Whose genial splendour bids the harvest wave, And fills the earth with gladness, while his ray Thrills the dark chamber of the mountain cave, And lights the coral rocks, which ocean's valleys pave. As 'mid Capernaum's crowd he past along, âWho touch'd me?â ask'd the Saviour of mankind. âLord, dost thou see,â his followers said, âthe throng, That on thee press, before, beside, behind, And dost thou ask, Who touch'd me?â But the mind Of cloudless wisdom who may hope to shun! âSome hand hath touch'd my garment,â he rejoin'd: And his keen eye, irradiant as the sun, Glanc'd o'er the crowd to see by whom the deed was done. The deed alleg'd the unconscious crowd deny. But one there was, who that soul-searching word, And the keen glance of that commanding eye, Could not unmov'd endure: but when she heard Once and again the Saviour's charge preferr'd, Forth from the circling crowd, where not conceal'd She shrunk, fear-struck and cowering as a bird Scar'd from her nestling's covert, quick she kneel'd Low at the Saviour's feet, and all her tale reveal'd. Was it a tale of guiltiness, that so Smit with alarm she trembled and dismay? Alas, of guilt no story, but of woe. Twelve years the victim of disease she lay, Twelve years of inward hemorrhage the prey. And still for aid medicinal she flew Now here, now there, in vain, her grief to stay: Nor comfort now, nor help, nor hope she knew; For still her substance waned, and still her ailment grew. But she had heard of Jesus; and she thought, 'Twas his more aid and mightier to bestow, Than skill medicinal: and now she sought On him the burden of her care to throw. Enough behind him in the crowd to go, âFor well,â thus said she in her musing breast, âIf I but touch his garment's hem, I know, That touch shall leave me from my plague releas'd:ââ She touch'd, and felt at once that ancient plague was ceas'd. She touch'd his clothes, and bade her soul rejoice To find the fountain of her sorrow dry. But when she heard his all-commanding voice Proclaim the deed, and met his piercing eye, Call'd from the shade of her obscurity, She felt her buoyancy of joy controll'd By conscious dread and deep humility; And in the people's ears her daring bold, And her long-seated plague, and her well-being told. Meseems it not, that one, whose misery sought With faith like hers the mighty Master's aid, Could in her mind have nurs'd the unworthy thought, His deed of mercy from himself to shade: I rather deem she trembled thus afraid, For that her healing, as her grief, for shame She hid from others; nor the tribute paid Of honour to her Benefactor's name, Meet cause of ire in him, to her meet cause of blame. But He, the storm of whose imagin'd ire That woman dar'd not tho' in fancy brook, Did he encounter her with eye of fir?, And arm his tongue with shafts of sharp rebuke? Ah, no! with soothing and paternal look, âCheer thee,â he said, âmy daughter! lo, is quell'd The tyrant plague, which o'er thy body shook His rod relentless, by thy faith expell'd; And o'er thee never more shall that dread scourge be held.â 'Tis said, and well to them the tale is known, Who tread the paths of legendary lore, Signs of the mercy to that woman shewn, She placed two brazen statues at her door: There stood the Saviour, gently bending o'er The suppliant woman; and with eyes uprais'd There too the suppliant woman knelt before The bounteous Saviour, and intently gazed, As he his hands outspread in act of blessing rais'd. But let the tale of old tradition pass; For to our minds the Saviour's records tell, With traits more true than monumental brass, The living portrait of that miracle. And on the lovely scene 'tis sweet to dwell, Memorial of that woman's great release: To mark what feelings in her bosom swell, And what the Saviour's might, who gave to cease At once her stubborn plague, and sent her thence in peace. Yea, sweet to mark, how faith's unshaken root Deep in her silent heart's recesses dwelt: And how it bloom'd, and ripen'd into fruit, What time she touch'd the garment's hem, and felt The inward cure that healing virtue dealt: And all polluted as herself she knew, And worthless, how with humbleness she knelt, And told her ill; and whence the cure she drew; And Him, who wrought the cure, confess'd with honour due. And sweet to mark the wondrous potency, Which in the Saviour's person made abode: Bright effluence of essential Deity, With light innate, ineffable, it glow'd; Nor rested there, but forth its virtue shew'd, To faith responsive; and around him shed A cheering influence, like the oil which flow'd In streams of fragrancy from Aaron's head, And down his beard, and down his raiment's skirts it spread. Mine be that woman's faith, tho' mix'd it seem With touch of frail humanity's alloy: Be mine, like her, of his great pow'r to deem, Who wrought the healing of her life's annoy, Fit theme for praise, and not unthankful joy! And, oh, be mine, like her to hear âBe wholeâ By Him pronounc'd, who only can destroy The floods of sin, that like a deluge roll, Till He pronounce the word of healing to the soul! Yes, 'tis for them, who feel the secret taint Of sin primeval thro' their bosom glide, By that infirmity of nature faint, Forlorn and hopeless of all cure beside, His healing aid to seek, in whom reside Glory and love divine: 'tis his to stem, In faith's behoof, corruption's swelling tide; Nor let pollution's plague abide on them, Who on the Saviour press to touch his garment's hem. THE UNBELIEVING NAZARENES. Matt. xiii. 54â58; Mark vi. 1â6. 'Tis sweet to him, who treasures lore divine, The coasts, with zeal of palmer old, to trace, Hills, vales, and streams of holy Palestine; And mark in every ancient-hallowed place What rays of glory wont of yore to shine, What acts of wonder and what words of grace: How here the mourner heard glad news of rest; Here the deaf ear the Saviour's presence blest, The sightless eye beheld, the speechless tongue confest. And sweet to them, whose bounded lot at home Constrains their steps in quietude to stay, Yea, sweet it is to them, afar to roam In thought companions of the palmer's way, And to the mother land of Christendom The debt of more than patriot fondness pay. If Judah's palmy hills their sojourn be; Or Jordan's flood; or lone Tiberias' sea; Or thy once glorious towns, thrice favour'd Galilee. Yes, favour'd Galilee, the boast was thine, To see the gross o'ershadowing darkness melt, So spake Isaiah, at the light divine. Then Cana saw the crystal water dealt Forth at a word in cups of generous wine; From far the healing voice Capernaum felt; Bethsaida's desert hail'd the growing bread; By Tabor's mount the howling demon fled; And NaÃ¯n's crowd proclaim'd the widow's rescued dead. Each spot, as on the pilgrim's feet proceed, Teems with memorials of creation's Lord; While, ever bounteous, he the boon decreed, Meet prize of faith, the willing mind's reward: Yet one there is, where no stupendous deed With mark peculiar stamps the fair record: His title thence tho' Israel's Prophet drew, And there in wisdom as in stature grew, And thence his rising beams the promis'd day-spring threw. Ah, wherefore was it, Nazareth, that He, Who lov'd his own with tenderness and ruth, Could work no work of mightiness in thee, Sure witness to his words of heavenly truth; In thee, the nursery of his infancy; In thee, the dwelling of his ripening youth? Tho' still he blest the Galilean strand, And ev'n his mercy reach'd Sidonian land, Why of his love in thee does no memorial stand? 'Twas that the promise of his early day, Which thou beheldest, pure and undefil'd; 'Twas that the brightness of his noontide ray, When youth redeem'd the promise of the child; 'Twas that the beams of grace, confest to play Around him with majestick glory mild; What time before thy sons he 'gan unfold Truths in Isaiah's mystick scroll inroll'd, And in himself reveal'd the Lord's Anointed told; 'Twas that his wonders on thy borders wrought, And thence by fame thro' all thy region spread, With strength celestial, as with wisdom, fraught, Shewn in the blind, the lame, the sick, the dead; All fail'd to conquer the reluctant thought, Of error fond, by prejudice misled: All fail'd to thy benighted sons to prove, 'Gainst heavenly truth whilst earthly passions strove, His ministry divine, his mission from above. âWhat, is not this the carpenter?â they cried; âA craftsman, and the craftsman Joseph's son? And she, who bore him, doth not she reside With us, his mother Mary? nor unknown His brethren, sisters; do not all abide Our fellows they? Then how has he aloneââ Hard were the words, and sharpen'd by offence,â âHow to a Prophet's name has he pretence? And whence his works of might? his words of wisdom whence?â Alas! had honest hearts the question made, They to themselves had made the meet reply. Such might, such wisdom, thus by man display'd, Whence could they come, unless from God most high? But worldly thoughts the better mind betray'd, The Prophet's high pretensions to deny, And held them back from faith. And to his might Forbore to work before their erring sight, What, having pow'r to see, they would not see aright. Yet here and there a faithful one was seen, Who on their country's Prophet durst rely: So still amid the world's most dreary scene Gleams forth a spark of heav'n-lit piety; In the waste wilderness an islet green, A gem of light in heaven's dark canopy. On them, of number scant, and in the shade Of lowly life, unnam'd and unportray'd, The hand, whose touch was health, the approving Saviour laid. And, oh, if such thy multitude had been, Prompt to submit to reason's sage control, What mighty works hadst thou, fond city, seen Wrought in thy streets; and of thy sons made whole How many a faint and heart-sick Nazarene Had health of body felt, and peace of soul! But on thy spirit wilful slumber lay: And He, thy Prophet, whom thou sought'st to slay, Dishonour'd gave thee o'er to thine own will a prey! Now, pilgrim, on! And while thou wendest slow O'er Nazareth's white hills and grassy dell, Forbear around thy curious glance to throw, Seeking the site of some high miracle. Such marvel there the Saviour deign'd not shew! Note thou the fact, the reason ponder well: And hark! a heav'n-taught voice, in whispers clear, Drops in the portal of thy mental ear Words of deep caution wise, and reverential fear. âGod on the willing mind his aid bestows, Enough to guide it on its homeward way: But, who reject the proffer'd bounty, those He gives in wilfulness of soul to stray; Nor upon eyes, that 'gainst his radiance close Their lids presumptuous, sheds his sunny ray. Have faith in Christ, and He will bring relief: Spurn Him; and bear, as best thou may'st, thy grief, To idle reasonings left, and graceless unbelief.â THE FIVE THOUSAND FED. Matt. xiv. 13â21. Mark vi. 32â44. Luke ix. 10â17. John vi. 1â14. Lift up your eyes, and cast them far that desert place around; Five thousand men are there to see, reclining on the ground: Five thousand men are there to see, in that unpeopled wild, With many a way-worn female mix'd, and many a weary child. Together on the green grass sward of yonder sloping hill, Where hastes to reach Tiberias' lake that tributary rill, In fifties and in hundreds all, from various quarters met, In order like a banner'd host with marshall'd ranks are set. But other face these crowds present, than one of warlike air; And other thoughts, than those of fight, their ranks have marshall'd there: And other semblance, than the pomp and circumstance of war, And other followers, than the train which tracks the warrior's car, On him attend, and mark his mien, whose gently-spoken word, Soft as the breath of southern gale, or song of vernal bird, But potent as the desert's blast, or lightning's viewless thrill, Has rang'd the obedient multitude on yonder sloping hill. What tho', whene'er he wills, the host of heav'n compose his state, And countless legions of the sons of light his bidding wait, Twelve weak and humble men alone are now his whole array, And he, in semblance like the rest, as low and weak as they. The guests are set: for guests, prepar'd their evening meal to take, Are yonder ranks from towns that skirt the Galilean lake; Chorazin, and Capernaum, sad scene of threaten'd woes, And northward where old Jordan's stream by rich Bethsaida flows. Thence had they trac'd the Saviour's steps, his healing pow'r to feel, And hear him speak the words of truth, their inward wounds to heal: And still they linger'd round about, and still and still remain'd, Nor thought how far away their homes, nor how the day had wan'd. But He o'er all the multitude has cast a musing eye, And mark'd how ill that houseless waste could hunger's wants supply, And thought how many a needy one, if further they should stray, For divers of them came from far, must faint upon the way. And he with hospitable care has sought a welcome store, To lay amid that desert place the multitude before: And he for that promiscuous crowd has issued forth the word, âGo, range the men in companies each on the green grass sward.â The guests are set: beside their Lord the twelve attendants stand, Their eyes with duteous reverence watch the motions of his hand: But little for that host they see of their expected fare, Five loaves of bread alone are found, and two small fishes there. But lo, with blessing on his lips that scanty fare he takes, And with the voice of thanksgiving the loaves devoutly breaks; His looks to heav'n above are cast; his hands around him deal, Transmitted by his followers' care, the crowd's expected meal. And still, as sanctified by pray'r his hand the boon bestows, Beneath his recreative touch the wondrous substance grows: And still with eager appetite the crowds surrounding eat; And still the loaves, the fishes, last, each eager wish to meet. Five thousand men were there reclin'd amid that barren wild, With many a woman craving food, and many a hungry child: Five thousand men to their content, as freely as they will'd, With many a child and woman there, have eaten and are fill'd. Five loaves of bread were there supplied, when first that meal began; Five loaves of bread have satisfied each woman, child, and man. And, lo, lest aught, which God hath given, to man be giv'n in vain, Twelve baskets full collected stand of fragments that remain. Considerate mercy! thus to mark the poor with watchful eye, And thus the needy sons of men with pitying eyelids try; The way-worn frame, the faltering limb, the fainting heart to spare; And o'er the destitute extend his own protecting care! Abundant bounty! which could thus its plenteous stores expand, To nourish all those companies with large and liberal hand; Not here and there a partial drop; but, in one fruitful hour, To fertilize the wilderness with that benignant show'r! Amazing power! to work at will that unforeseen supply, And make the creatures at a thought increase and multiply: Such power, as bids the buried seed within its furrow grow, And forms the blade, the ear, the corn, we sleep and know not how! Hail, Prophet, long âto comeâ foretold, like Him who Israel led, And in Arabia's stony waste with heaven-sent manna fed: But worthier far than he, whose face with borrow'd radiance shone; He but a servant in thy house, where thou presid'st a Son! Lord, as in this world's wilderness in search of thee I roam, And falter on, with hunger faint, way-wearied, far from home; Thy mercy, prompt when misery needs; thy bounteous care be mine: Thy suppliant with thy power preserve, and feed with food divine! THE WALK UPON THE WATERS. Matt. xiv. 22â27; 32â34. Mark vi. 45â53. John vi. 16â21. The night was still ruler on Galilee's lake, Where a shallop was toiling its passage to make, In the wind's and the billows' despite: For the wind it blew strong from Capernaum's coast, And the bark in that rock-girdled hollow was tost O'er the billows of sable and white. Three watches are past, and the fourth is begun: Should seem, as they labour in vain, that the sun, Which set to the mariners' eyes, As they went by Bethsaida the shallop aboard, Or ere in Capernaum's haven they moor'd, Would o'er Gilead's mountains arise. But what vision is yonder? A humanlike form, By the wind unimpeded, unblench'd by the storm, On the waves moving onward is seen: The surges supply him a footing; the air Waves the folds of his garment, and streams in his hair, But disturbs not his motion serene. As the storm-nourish'd petrels, the sons of the deep, Float at ease on its surface, and fearlessly sleep, So the surges that Passenger bore: Nor more to his feet doth the water-flood yield, Than if planted they were on some grass-mantled field, Or the water were crystalliz'd o'er. Right onward, with purpose determin'd and clear, Right onward the form to the shallop draws near, And seems as if passing it by: Alarm'd and confounded, its aspect and mien Thro' the veil of the twilight imperfectly seen, â'Tis a spirit,â the mariners cry. To their fancy some soul disembodied it seem'd, For such o'er the earth were permitted, they deem'd, Thin shadowlike phantoms to go: Or some demon, they thought, was disclos'd to their sight, Of the spirits of darkness that walk in the night, Dispensing destruction and woe. For who, tho' their eyes had one Being beheld, That o'er nature the sceptre of royalty held On thy billows, Gennesaret, sway'd, And had seen, as he utter'd the voice of his will, How the winds were at peace, and the billows were still, And the tempest his bidding obey'd; Yet who could suppose, that a son of the earth Could dwell in the mansion assign'd at his birth, From fleshly impediments free; That a body substantial, akin to mankind, Could move as if cloth'd with the wings of the wind, And tread on the waves of the sea? â'Tis a spirit,â the terrified mariners cry: âFear not, but take courage; behold, it is I;â Thus the figure spake peace to their heart: And those mariners, toiling on Galilee's sea, The disciples of Jesus, perceiv'd it was He, Whom they left on the mountain apart; What time in the eve, at the close of the day, O'er the lake from the desert he sent them away To Capernaum's port to repair; And himself he withdrew to the solitude's height, With God to converse in the stillness of night, And indulge the communion of pray'r. Apart in the mountain from evening he stay'd; And there, thro' the watch of the midnight he pray'd, To his Father, the Fountain of love: Thence forth from that holy communion he past, Where, hardly beset with the waves and the blast, His disciples in jeopardy strove: For with eyes afar off, thro' the darkness of night, More keen than the eagle's in fulness of light, He fail'd not their trouble to scan: And, the incense to God of his orisons paid, He fain would the wants of humanity aid, And bring rescue and comfort to man. He has finish'd his course; he the vessel has gain'd; To its inmates, with rowing and watchfulness pain'd, He is come, ne'er a welcomer guest: The wind, it has ceas'd; and the billows are still; The bark, as with knowledge instinct of his will, Speeds on to the haven of rest: Unmov'd by the breeze, unpropell'd by the oar, As with knowledge instinct, she has sped to the shore, While round him the mariners press; Acknowledge the Godhead's infallible sign, Bow down to the presence of glory divine, And the Son of the Mighty confess. In those mariners, toiling on Galilee's lake, Of mankind, as their homeward-bound voyage they make, How true is the portraiture found! On the waves of this troublesome world they are tost, By contrary winds still impeded and crost, While night spreads her curtain around. Unassisted they labour, but labour in vain, Their haven, the scope of their wishes to gain, Still pent in the midst of the deep: But He, who the waves of Gennesaret trod, From the mount, where he dwells in communion with God, With thoughts that ne'er slumber nor sleep, On them, who are fainting with labour distrest, As toiling they pant for refreshment and rest, Still looks with a pitiful eye; To the labouring vessel he loves to draw near, He enlivens their hope, he disperses their fear, âTake courage, fear not, it is I. âNo spirit portentous, no dream of the mind, 'Tis I, who bear rule o'er the souls of mankind, Whom the spirits invisible own: 'Tis I, in mortality's semblance array'd, Of old who the might of the Father display'd, His image and heir of his throne. â'Tis I, who the arch of the firmament spread, On the heights of the mountain-like surges I tread; The winds in my balance I weigh; Bars and doors have I set to the inswelling tide, And, rebuking the sea in the height of his pride, âHitherto, and no further,â I say. âReceive me, ye children of travail and woe: As on through this world of temptation ye go, Tribulation and toil is your doom. But fear not, for One who is greater is here, The doubtful to strengthen, the timid to cheer; And I have the world overcome. âBe the labouring bark to my guidance consign'd; On me be the hope of your bosom reclin'd; By your lip my dominion confest: My will shall from peril protect you and save, Bear you onward triumphant o'er wind and o'er wave, And moor in your haven of rest.â THE SYRO-PHENICIAN WOMAN. Matt. xv. 21â28; Mark vii. 24â30. âLord, send her away, for she after us cries;â The disciples in weariness say: But naught to her crying the Saviour replies, As he tranquilly moves on his way. Still on as he moves, from a woman distrest Cries are heard, and compassion they crave: âLord, my child by a demon is sorely opprest; Son of David, have mercy and save!â And who is that woman? Of Israel's race, To Israel's God does she bow? Has she sought in his temple the pledges of grace? To his truth has she plighted her vow? That now from the depth of maternal distress To the promis'd Redeemer she flies; Calls on Israel's Prophet her daughter to bless, And on Israel's Monarch relies! Ah, no! a sad outcast is she on the world; Of that remnant of heathendom left, When Joshua's banner, in triumph unfurl'd, Of her princes had Palestine reft; And still in the land has that remnant indur'd, By no hope, by no promises fed: To the worship obscene of their fathers inur'd, And their gods are the forms of the dead. Over these, on the borders of Lebanon strown, Ancient Zidon her empire maintains: And Tyrus, the daughter of Zidon, alone Where a queen on her island she reigns. There vows from the grove on the time-hallow'd steep To Baal and Ashtaroth rise: And for Tammuz the maidens of Syria weep, As wounded and bleeding he lies. But Galilee's Sun shall pour lustre on them, Who are sitting gross darkness beneath; And the Day-spring from high is beginning to gleam On the lands of the shadow of death. Of the light, on the confines of night and of day, All comfortless, hopeless, forlorn, That woman has witness'd a glimmering ray, And she hastens to welcome the morn. By no terror dismay'd, by no doubting perplex'd, She is speeding his blessing to crave: âLord, my child by a demon is grievously vex'd; Son of David, release her and save!â Not a word, not a look, to her plaint he replies: His disciples impatiently say, âLord, send her away; for she after us cries:â But he tranquilly moves on his way. Not a word, not a look, as still onward he went, Till this sentence forbidding he gave: âThe lost sheep of Israel alone am I sent In their wanderings to seek and to save.â He has enter'd the house: he is plac'd in his seat, Not unnotic'd, a guest at the board: Lo, again she is there: she is fall'n at his feet; She has cried: but how keen is his word! â'Twere not fitting to take from the children their bread, And to dogs the choice nourishment throw.ââ âTruth, Lord: yet the dogs, when the children are fed Eat the crumbs, their Lord's table below.ââ Thou hast conquer'd, O woman! the triumph is thine; The triumph of faith and of pray'r! No more with maternal inquietude pine; To thy home, to thy daughter, repair! He hath prov'd thee in confidence earnest, sincere; He hath prov'd thee submissive and meek; He hath heard thee with fervour of heart persevere His grace long withheld to bespeak. He hath promis'd the boon; he the promise hath seal'd; On thy way he hath sent thee in peace: âFor this saying of thine, lo, thy daughter is heal'd: Thy faith is thy daughter's release!â O, first of thy race, of the Gentiles the first, Who, estrang'd from the knowledge of God, In the gloom of idolatrous worship immerst, Had the courts of his house never trod; The first at the feet of Messiah to kneel, And confess him almighty to save; The first from his bounty the blessing to feel, Which thou wert the foremost to crave: Ah, hard on thy faith was the trial impos'd, And painful and fearful thy part; To thy plaint while the lips of the Saviour were clos'd, And clos'd to all semblance his heart. In semblance alone! No unkindness was there; 'Twas only thy breast to unfold, Ere he gave thee, a stranger, an alien, to share The blessings ordain'd for his fold. Of the grace, which can help from our spiritual foe, Now the portal wide open is thrown: Thither freely, who will, unrestricted may go, One fold, and one Shepherd alone. The flock of his pasture, the sheep of his hand, Jew and Gentile together are met. May they follow his steps! may they hear his command! And, O! may they never forget, Like thee, at the feet of Messiah to bow; Like thee, his salvation to crave; As faithful, as humble, as fervent as thou, His name to solicit, their trust to avow; âSon of David, have mercy and save!â THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN. Mark vii. 31â37. Praise to Him who made the ear! Praise to Him who form'd the tongue! Nobler subject who can hear, How can worthier theme be sung, Than His praise, whose bounteous pow'r Gave us in the natal hour, Senses to enrich, unbind, All the faculties of mind? Other lot on him attends, Whom amid the gazing throng Onward draw his pitying friends Thro' Decapolis along. Sad and gloomy is his lot! Notes of praise, he hears them not: Notes of praise, around him sung, Sound not from his echoing tongue. His nor song of woodland bird, Sweeping breeze or rushing sea, Voice of flock or lowing herd, Nor the notes of minstrelsy. Song nor manly eloquence Soothes his soul, or charms his sense; Words of truth inspir'd, nor lays Utter'd to the Inspirer's praise. 'Tis not his the sounds to pour, Sweet to love, to friendship dear; Nor to draw from wisdom's store Speech, may fix the tranced ear. Genius prompts not him to wreathe âWords that burn, and thoughts that breathe:â Thoughts, that breathe the soul's desire; Words, that burn with holy fire. See him to the Saviour brought: There, as destitute he lies, How procure the blessing sought? âAsk of me,â the Saviour cries; âAsk; and I the boon will give: Ask; and what ye ask receive.â Ah! devoid of ear, of speech, How can he obey, beseech? See, his friends attendant wait: Hark, they urge the kind request. But a mightier advocate Dwells within the Saviour's breast. What to him can louder cry, Than the sight of misery? What more strong to intercede, Than the impotence to plead? He the man has drawn aside From the multitude among; To his ears his hand applied, Spit, and gently touch'd his tongue. He to heav'n hath cast his eye, From his bosom heav'd a sigh, And the potent word hath said, âEphphathaâbe opened!â âEphphathaââand open lie, Clos'd of old, the paths of sound: âEphphathaââis loos'd the tie, Which of speech the organ bound. Well he hears, and well he speaks: Forth his voice in praises breaks; Praises to the God of heaven, For his speech, his hearing given. Wonder-struck, the people hear, And the shout of praise prolong: âBlest be he, who made the ear! Blest be he, who form'd the tongue! Blest thy Prophet, Israel! Done by him are all things well: Speech by him, and hearing come; Hears the deaf, and speaks the dumb!â Yes: when he the mandate gives, âEphphatha,â the open'd ear, Tho' by nature deaf, receives Pow'r the Saviour's voice to hear. Yes: at his command unstrung, Tho' by nature dumb, the tongue Pow'r receives its bond to break, And the Saviour's praises speak. Happy, who with godly fear In the Saviour's gifts rejoice; Give to him the awaken'd ear, Lift for him the new-form'd voice! Who with thought intent his will Seek to learn and to fulfil: Who with heart and lip his name Love to cherish and proclaim! They are from his volume taught Sounds unknown to worldly ears; Sweeter than to poet's thought Seems the musick of the spheres. By his Spirit they are led Accents of delight to spread; Such as once thro' Bethlehem's coast Echoed from the heavenly host. They, their course of duty run, From the earth's obstructions freed, Blest shall hear their Lord's âWell doneâ From the emerald throne proceed. They shall join all nature's hymn, 'Mid the shouts of Cherubim; âGlory to our God be paid: For he spake, and we were made!â THE SUNDAY MORNING'S WALK. 'Twas morning when I walk'd abroad, the day which God hath blest, When on the world its Maker calls to keep his holy rest: The spirit of the time I felt; and nature seem'd to say, It was the day of God's delight, his works' thanksgiving day. My pathway thro' the garden led: the bees in nature's prime Lurk'd in the apple's clustering bloom, and suck'd the scented thyme: And as with humming sound to cull their morning meal they flew, The hum appear'd a morning hymn to God their Maker due. My pathway led along the coombe, the woodland, and the hill; And every bird of every wing was singing sweet and shrill: The throstle caroll'd in the bush, the skylark from the air; They seem'd as if they all would fain their Maker's love declare. My path along the hedge-row lay, the tangled copse among: The violet spread its snow-white breast, its head the hare-bell hung: Their hues so fair, their soft array, their fresh and fragrant smell, All seem'd without the aid of speech the Maker's praise to tell. My path-way lay along the meads, with babbling runnels fed, Where bleating flocks and lowing herds were o'er the pasture spread: And bleating flock and lowing herd, which crop'd the verdant food, With babbling runnels seem'd to join, and speak their Maker good. Along the corn-fields lay my path: the promis'd harvest's pride The hollow of the valleys fill'd, and cloth'd the mountain's side: And, as it bow'd and wav'd its head, brush'd by the zephyr's wing, In honour of the harvest's Lord it seem'd to laugh and sing. Along the strand my path-way led, the salt sea-shore beside, Where from his throne the sun look'd down, and lit the golden tide: And as the billows danc'd and shone, beneath his sparkling rays, They seem'd to clap their hands for joy, and shout the Maker's praise. My path led onward to the church: what things were present there? Sounds of exceeding great delight? a scene surpassing fair? There those who bore a living soul, with reason's stamp imprest, And tongues to speak articulate the yearnings of the breast; Alas, to their salvation's Rock tho' call'd to shout and sing, And with the voice of triumph praise the everlasting King, Back from the heart-enlivening strain with listless silence hung, As if a door confin'd their lips, and chains withheld their tongue. Not thus the Church would fain of old the pealing anthem swell, One feeble voice uprais'd the mute assembly's joy to tell; But rich and poor, the young and old, the peasant and the sage, Of every quality combin'd, each sex, and every age, Their psalms and hymns and holy songs like mighty thunders roll'd, While rapture, which the spirit felt, the tongue spontaneous told; Pour'd forth the song of thanksgiving till all the temple rang, And like the voice of many floods their Hallelujahs sang. Such sounds the sons of God pour forth, one spirit and one voice, Where round the throne the Cherubim and Seraphim rejoice: Ten thousand times ten thousand there awake the sacred song, And thousand thousands numberless the Hosannas loud prolong. And shall such sounds in heav'n be heard from God's celestial train, No voice exempt, no tongue but joins the gratulating strain: And do not sounds like these, the sounds of holy, heartfelt, mirth, The candidates for heavenly joys befit, the sons of earth? O, are there those who when the name of God their voice requires, To sing his glory in the words which God himselfinspires, With cold indifference sit them down, nor deign the voice to raise, Nor move the tongue, nor ope the lip, to sing their Maker's praise: Tho' prompt the live-long hour to wake notes of the tuneful art, Which win the crowd's enamour'd ear, but speak not to the heart; To trill the light, the meaningless, perchance the guilty strain, The libertine's seductive lay, the sceptick's rhime profane? Shame, shame on such! a wiser way and worthier may they learn, Not from the seraph hosts alone, who round God's altar burn, But from the meaner things of God, which never cease to shew His love, as best they may, by whom they live, and move, and grow. The herd, the flock, the warbled song of birds, the humming bee, The scented flow'r, the running brook, the bright and billowy sea, In feeling's ear their pow'rs of praise employ, as best they can, And all the sullenness reprove of dull unthankful man. Lord, grant me grace the pow'rs thou giv'st, how weak soe'er they be, Well pleas'd, to proffer as most due, in celebrating Thee! 'Tis Thou hast form'd the thinking soul, and Thou the speaking voice: In what, if not in Thee, O Lord, should soul and speech rejoice? Thy works all praise Thee! noblest work of thine, bid man arise, And in the general chorus join of earth, and sea, and skies! Rude tho' it be, the artless psalm with Thee acceptance finds, Pour'd forth from good and honest hearts, from meek and willing minds. âLord God Almighty, King of saints,â who only can'st of right The blessing and the honour claim, the glory, and the might; Tho' none can praise Thee worthily, yet who shall stint thy praise? For âgreat and marvellous thy works, and just and true thy ways!â THE SUNDAY EVENING'S WALK. The day had wan'd: the holy day, for man's repose design'd; His day, who made the world; and his, who ransom'd lost mankind. My feet, for so my Saviour wont, had duly been to pay Meet homage in the house of Him, who sanctified the day. There with his Church in pray'r and praise my lips were fain to join, And from his priest my ears were fain to list to truth divine. To cherish feelings with the day of holy rest allied, Like Isaac to the field I went to muse at eventide. Beneath my feet the wild flow'r lay: I mark'd its lovely hue, Its fragrance sweet, its texture fine; and ponder'd how it grew: I ponder'd how from earth's green lap at nature's birth it came, And flourish'd still from age to age, another and the same: I scann'd the providential care, the goodness, and the power, Which with surpassing beauty cloth'd the perishable flower; And thought, if creatures of a day could thus engage his care, Much more should they of living soul his watchful bounty share. The little birds beneath the leaves were nestling for repose, And ever and anon a peal of harmony arose: The song was hush'd; but still was heard a twittering here and there: It seem'd to be the parting note of thanksgiving and pray'r. It seem'd to willing ears to say, âBy us, O man, be taught To trust in Him who feedeth us, O thou of little thought! To praise Him, from the fowler's snare who guardeth thee by day; And from the night's approaching storm his sheltering covert pray.â The swallow skimm'd across my path: for now the year's sweet prime Had warn'd her o'er the vernal seas to seek a genial clime: Secure the summer months to pass, till hence again she fly, A home from wintry blasts to find beneath a warmer sky. And, thought I, shall these birds observe the seasons far abroad, And shall not God's own people know the judgment of their God? O, for the swallow's wing, and skill, by pow'r divine imprest, Far from the stormy wind to flee, and seek the appointed rest! The sheep at random lay repos'd, or wander'd o'er the mead: But hark! the shepherd's folding voice; and see! their willing speed. The cows with homeward footsteps still are moving o'er the field, To stall them at their master's crib, their gather'd wealth to yield. And shall the very beasts, I thought, their earthly owner know, Safe in his homestead shelter seek; and as he wills them, go? And shall the sought, the call'd of God, from his commandment stray, Nor in their Master's home repose, nor at his call obey? The sun was sinking in the west: I mark'd his radiance throw O'er all the earth, the sea, the sky, a smiling farewell glow; And as he sank, the clouds, array'd with purple gleams and gold, The track of his departing light, his course of glory told. And, O thou glorious Sun, I said, with richer rays than thine Did He, with healing on his wings, the Sun of goodness shine: And o'er the world a lovelier flood of parting splendour pour, That we his glory's track might note, his light far off adore. The sun was set. I mark'd the stars as gleaming, one by one, Bright thro' the twilight's deepening shade the gems of evening shone: Till rising o'er the eastern hills the full-orb'd moon was seen, And in her brightness walking forth along the blue serene. And O, while these fair works of thine possess my raptur'd thought, The moon which thy right hand hath form'd, the stars thy fingers wrought; Lord, what is man, I said, that thou a glance on him shouldst throw; Or son of man, that thou from heav'n shouldst visit him below? On him the solitude of night and stillness soon shall creep, As o'er this fading face of things; and mantle him in sleep: But thou hast said, we shall not sleep in everlasting night, But in the twinkling of an eye shall wake again to light: And then on this corruptible shall incorruption rest, And robes of immortality this mortal shall invest; And they, who in the Saviour's strength the Saviour's work have done, Shall in their Father's kingdom shine with glory, as the sun. Thus gazing on the works of God, the word of God my guide, Like Isaac to the field I go, and muse at eventide: And thus from every sound and sight, in earth or circling air, Fit theme for solemn thought I find, and read a sermon there. Thence home return'd, I lay me down in peace, and seek my rest; Safe in his arm, and in the trust of his protection blest: But ere I sleep, with trembling hope my night's oblation make, Thus in his Prophet's strain of old, and for my Saviour's sake. âTo Thee, Great God, most merciful, my spirit I commend: Thy favour can thy servant's bed, as with a shield, defend. Thou canst sustain and raise me up in life, if such thy will: And thou, if death be thy decree, canst raise and save me still. âGrant that each evening in its course this wayward heart may find, Still more observant of thy laws, and to thy will resign'd; And when the last dread evening comes, do thou my soul convey, With Thee among thy saints to dwell in never-ending day!â THE TRANSFIGURATION. Matt. xvii. 1â8; Mark ix. 2â8; Luke ix. 28â36; 2 Pet. i. 16â18. Yet once again, or ere his course be o'er, The goal be compast, and the conquest won, On his meek head will heav'n its radiance pour, And the great Father hail his only Son. Erewhile, his holy progress scarce begun, In Jordan's stream he heard the solemn âHail;â Again shall hear, his progress well nigh done, Now that around the shades of evening sail, And o'er him for a space must night's deep gloom prevail. But other scene first waits the ravish'd eye On the broad summit of that mountain lone, Where Tabor lifts in wooded beauty high From Esdraelon's plain his flatten'd cone, âThe holy mountâ by old tradition known. There the meek Saviour of the world to pray Retir'd, as wont, before his Father's throne: Hard by, his favour'd three in slumber lay, For steep the mountain's side, and wearisome the way. What glorious form their sight awakening views! Nor nature such magnificence can shew, Nor fancy paint with visionary hues! Mark ye what whiteness clothes the mountain snow; What gems of lustre 'mid its whiteness glow, Touch'd with the radiance of the morning beams; What floods of glory from that radiance flow? More pure, more white his glistering raiment seems; With radiance more intense his sun-like aspect gleams. And there two saints of God their eyes behold! With glory they, but less resplendent, shine, And holy converse with the Saviour hold: His death they ponder, and his death's design. He, who of old time gave the Law divine, Whose sepulchre no eye of mortal knew: And he, the mightiest of the Prophet-line, Who in a whirlwind, far from mortal view, Rapt in a car of fire, with fiery coursers flew. Forth are they come, each from his unseen place, With deep devotion to Messiah's name, His opening kingdom with their forms to grace, The Law's intention, and the Prophets' aim. âLord, it is good,â a voice is heard exclaim, 'Tis zealous Peter's, âthat we sojourn here: Speak thou; and we will three pavilions frame; One for thyself majestick let us rear, For Israel's leader one, one for the Tishbite seer.â His words he knew not, o'er his raptur'd soul So thick, amazement, awe, and terror crowd. But while he speaks, they see a spreading stole Of clouded brightness all the mount inshroud. As thro' the shadow of that golden cloud Darkling they pass, they prostrate fall for fear; And hark! a voice thence sounding, deep and loud, âBehold, my Son, my well-beloved, here! In him my soul delights: to him, to him give ear!â The voice is past: and past the shadowy skreen Of light: and Moses and Elijah gone! Touch'd the disciples rise; but naught is seen, Save him who touch'd them, save their Lord alone: In vain the exploring eyes around are thrown, But still they rest, which way soe'er they strain, On Carmel's woods, or snow-crown'd Lebanon, Tiberias' lake, or Esdraelon's plain, Or, sparkling far away, Philistia's western main. Past is the voice; the sight of glory past, Which, like the lightning, smote the Apostles' sense: But deeply seated in their memory last Bright traces of that glory's excellence. Taught by the heavenly voice, they treasure whence The Saviour came, and what his birth-right sway, Surpassing all created pow'r; and thence Departing, onward look they to the day, When He to future worlds his glory will display. Hence on their sight, teeming with holy hope And bliss immortal, goodly prospects rise. Forth thro' her prison bars, with ampler scope, Their soul looks forward, and in vision flies An eagle's flight above the starry skies: There plants her eye in ecstasy on one, Who sits begirt with angels' symphonies, In state triumphant, as for victory won, With snow-white vesture cloth'd, and aspect like the sun. There see they Moses break his useless rod, And there Elijah lead the Prophet train, Who chaunt hosanna to the Son of God; There their own voices bless Messiah's reign: And of mankind, who slept or who remain On earth till then, all at the throne appear: And hark! from yon bright cloud the voice again, âBehold, my Son, my well-beloved, here! In him my soul delights: to him, to him give ear!â The King is seated: and on either hand, Here a white flock, and there a sordid herd, Before his judgment-seat of glory stand. He hears their doings: he proclaims the word: These sink rejected; those ascend preferr'd To groves where streams of living waters flow: By them on earth Messiah's voice was heard; Now, where his face they may behold, they go, His glorious likeness wear, and him their Saviour know. Close we the view! That passing glimpse was shown Of majesty, so deem we, to allay His followers' fears; to make his glories known; And lead them onward to the one great day. Enough: awaits him now the hard essay, To break the toils by hell around him spread, Drink of the brook of sorrow in the way, And thro' the vale of death's dark shadow tread, Ere on the heavenly mount he lifts his glorious head. THE DEAF AND DUMB DEMONIACK. Matt. xvii. 14â21. Mark ix. 14â29. Luke ix. 37â42. With eyes upcast to Tabor's wood-crown'd head, As seeking one whom yet they fail to see, Around its base a mingled crowd is spread, Of Israel's sons a mingled company. And here a father's drooping form, and here, Foaming with rage, a maniack child, appear: Dash'd on the ground the child, and grovelling low; The father bending o'er in mute despairing woe. Keen is that father's sorrow for his child! His only son demoniack rage had stung; Sense from his soul's dominion was exil'd; Clos'd was his ear, and speechless was his tongue. He heard not, he, a father's tones of love! He spake not, he, such accents as might move To joy a father's feelings; as with pride, Which none but parents know, the opening bloom he eyed! But deep affection, still perchance more deep For that the child was stamp'd affliction's prey, Would o'er the father's soul her empire keep, And pity strengthen nature's inborn sway. As rack'd he lay beneath the demon's power, And felt the crisis of the torturing hour, In frantick rage, or melancholy mood, And brav'd the burning flame, or plung'd beneath the flood; Could man, of woman born, not form'd of stone, Weep not, to hear and see the stricken child: To hear his furious yells, his plaintive moan; And see his gnashing teeth, and eyeballs wild? And must not he, with anguish trebly keen, The father, who begat him, mark the scene: And his heart weep with blood drops o'er his son, His age's broken stay, his lov'd, his only one? Yea, keen that father's sorrow for his child! Sorrow which knew not hope; for on the gloom Of cheerlessness no ray of healing smil'd: The fiend had triumph'd o'er him from the womb. Nor breathes there one, that malady to quell; Forth from the child the tyrant fiend expel; The string, that holds the prison'd tongue, unbind; And reason's light diffuse o'er the benighted mind. Yes, one there is, whose will the demons own. Heard ye not how the heal'd his fame resound, From the far crags of Syrian Lebanon, To Kedron's brook, and eastern Jordan's bound? How banded fiends releas'd at his behest Her whose vex'd frame a sevenfold plague possest; And him, the dwelling of the host unclean, The inmate of the tombs, the untam'd Gadarene? Yes, there is one. Fly, father; quickly flyâ But no! apart from men on yonder hill He lingers. Turn then to his followers, try His chosen friends. Alas, not their's the skill, To call the demons forth: not their's the mind, By pray'r sublim'd, by abstinence refin'd; Not their's the faith, that can yon mount unplace, And say âBegone, and plant 'mid the Great sea thy base!â But who is He, whose footsteps downward bend From Tabor's steep? The crowd with dread amaze Before the majesty of brightness bend, Which o'er his aspect beams celestial rays. Now, father, while the gathering crowds salute The mighty Master, urge thy earnest suit; Quick to his eyes the piteous sufferer shew, And utter all thy wish, and tell of all thy woe. Tell, how from infant days the fiend malign Hath rul'd imperious o'er that child forlorn; Compell'd a senseless, speechless, thing to pine, His reason blinded, and his body torn: Then pray the Saviour on thy child to cast A look of love: thy dearest, and thy last! His is the great prerogative to save, If thou his pow'r adore, his kind compassion crave. 'Tis done: the tale of woe; the anxious pray'r; The sight distressful of the tortur'd child, Rending with shrieks of agony the air, All torn, and foaming, and with dust defil'd; To the kind words of promise, which bespeak Faith in the supplicant, his answer meek, Where hope, with fear at strife, 'mid tears of grief, âLord, I believe,â exclaims, âhelp thou mine unbelief:â Have reach'd the Saviour's heart. âFlee hence,â he cries, âFiend, deaf and dumb!â and lo, the fiend is fled. The child the crowd survey with wondering eyes, Sore rent, and prostrate, and in semblance dead. Dead but in semblance! See, he moves, he lives; The Saviour's touch reviving vigour gives, Awards the prize by faith's obedience won, And to the father's arms restores his rescued son. âLord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!â Thus in his breast conflicting passions strove, While for his child the suppliant sought relief, With the deep yearnings of a father's love. For help, surpassing human power, he knelt; Hope in his heart, but not unmix'd he felt With fear's misgivings, as with tears he pray'd Him, whom in faith he own'd, that wavering faith to aid. The Saviour heard, and ratified the claim, Sincere of purpose, tho' in vigour weak. Not his to quench the dimly burning flame! Not his the bent and bruised reed to break! The willing mind, the honest heart and good, With eyes of pitying tenderness he view'd; Fann'd the faint flax, sustain'd the drooping reed, Himself supplied the strength, and gave the promis'd meed. Nor vain the thought, as to that page we turn, That there the scholar of the Saviour's school May in that lively portraiture discern His own resemblance and his Master's rule. For tho', in conscience self-abas'd, he deem Not his the unshaken faith, may best beseem The flock of Him, whose character is light, Whose word the truth of God, whose works the Spirit's might; Yet may his plaint the Saviour's ear arrest, His pray'r secure the Saviour's kind regard, His faith, tho' faint, with rich increase be blest, And reap its own âexceeding great reward;â If, lowly prostrate at the Almighty throne, He make his woes, his wants, his weakness known; Seek from the Fountain of all good relief; And cry, âLord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!â THE MAN BORN BLIND. John ix. âI never saw the cheerful light; On these sad eyes it never shone: A veil impervious clos'd my sight; Darkness and light to me were one. âFrom infancy to youth I grew, From youth to manhood: but the while, Altho' a mother's love I knew, I never saw a mother's smile. âMy father, brethren, neighbours dealt Their kindly care, and still were nigh: But tho' the guiding hand I felt, I never saw the sparkling eye. âThey told me of the Almighty's Word, Recorded in our sacred Law: Attent, the truth reveal'd I heard, But the lov'd record never saw. âThey told me of the house of God, Which crowns our Sion's holy height: With them the marble floor I trod, But witness'd not each solemn rite. âThey talk'd to me of meadows green; The winding coombe; the mountain high; The lake, outspread with mirrour sheen; The lustre of the azure sky; âThe golden sun; the silver moon; The expanse, with brilliant stars besprent; The colours of the ethereal zone, Which the Creator's hand had bent: âBut hill, nor vale, nor vernal flower, Nor lucid lake, nor azure skies, I saw, bright signs of sovereign power; Nor, pledge of love, the rainbow's dyes. âAlike the sun's meridian light, The morning's dawn, the evening's fall, Were gloom to my unconscious sight:â 'Twas dark, dark, dark, and dreary all! â'Twas dreary all!â'Tis joyous now! I now creation's light behold: The heav'n above, the earth below, And all the wonders they unfold. âSecurely now I roam abroad, Unguided move, and walk, and run: And gaze upon the works of God; This pleasant earth, that glorious sun; âThe treasures of our sacred book; On Sion's height that holy pile; On all with ease, with joy, I look; My father's eye, my mother's smile! âAsk ye, to whom the boon I owe? Ask ye, what means the blessing gave? A man, so seem'd he, bade me go, And in Siloam's fountain lave. âBut first, with earth at random found, And moisten'd from his mouth, he made Of clay an ointment on the ground, And on my sightless eyeballs laid. â âGo, wash,â he said: with hope and awe, Unknowing who that man might be, The fount I sought; I wash'd; and saw: I saw; and still, like you, I see. âAsk ye, from whom the blessing came? What pow'r but His, who made the day, And gave the eye its curious frame, Can light it with the visual ray? âWhat man, since first the world began, Gave sight to one by nature blind? What man shall give?âSave he, the man, By seers of old to come design'd. âStamp'd on the works of God, inroll'd In God's own Book, I note the sign, Which bids me in the man behold, Who gave me sight, the Pow'r Divine. âO, ever on Siloam's fount, While beats my heart, shall memory dwell; That act of might my lips recount, And of the promis'd Shiloh tell. âAnd ever, as my sight I send O'er earth, or sea, or heav'n abroad, My knee shall low in worship bend, My tongue confess the Son of God. â'Twas he, my darkling eyeballs blind Enlighten'd with the pow'r of sight: 'Twas he, the darkness of my mind Illumin'd with his heav'nly light. âThus, thus, thou Life and Light of men, Grant me thy healing rays to see! 'Tis day, where thou vouchsaf'st to reign; 'Tis darkness all, bereft of Thee!â LITTLE CHILDREN BROUGHT UNTO CHRIST. Matt. xix. 13â15; Mark x. 13â16. âWhy the parents' care withstand For their children's blessedness? Why withhold my pray'r, my hand, Which would fain the children bless? From reproof, resistance, free, Let the children come to me: Suffer that the babes be brought, Suffer, and forbid them not! Do not they the bounty prove, Which by God to man is given? Share not they my Father's love? Are not they the heirs of heaven? Happy they, who come to me With a child's simplicity: None but such God's kingdom win; None but such can enter in.â With this mild but grave rebuke On his rash disciples' haste, Christ the offer'd children took, And within his arms embrac'd. With a parent's fostering look In his arms the babes he took; With his hands their head imprest; With his benediction blest. Who, the Christian's name that bear, Who, that bear the Christian's heart, Would not that their children share In the Saviour's love a part? Suffer then, at his command, Duly to the Saviour's hand They in life's first spring be brought: Suffer, and forbid them not! Be it yours, in life's fresh spring, Born in sin, expos'd to wrath, To his fourt the babes to bring, To his own appointed bath! He will pleas'd receive them there, Hallow'd by his Church's pray'r: With his arms of love embrace; And impart his Spirit's grace. Thus, when rul'd the law of old, By his covenanting rite God to his elected fold Chose the new-born Israelite. Thus, when rose the Gospel grace, Parents with their infant race, âThey and theirs,â were taught to lave In the sanctifying wave. Be it yours, at reason's dawn, To their opening mind to hold Truths, by Jesus' Spirit drawn, And in Jesus' book inroll'd. There to point with holy awe, How in terrors spake the law; And, to bid those terrors cease, How the Gospel whispers peace! Thus the youthful Timothy By maternal care was train'd, All the truths of God to see With the eye of faith unfeign'd. By the Scripture's light discern'd, Thus the wisdom true he learn'd, Which by faith in Jesus shews To the fainting soul repose. Be it yours, their childish step To the house of pray'r to lead, There to form their childish lip To pronounce the Christian's creed: There devotion's voice to pour; There imbibe religion's lore; And to fix their ear attent On the teachers God hath sent! Jesus thus himself would fain, In the morning tide of youth, In his Father's house remain, Listening to the words of truth. Fain would take the scholar's seat At the appointed teacher's feet; And, with modest aspect meek, Humbly hear, and sagely speak. Be it yours, to bid them join Those who round yon chancel kneel, Studious to receive the sign Of their Father's love; and seal, Pledg'd anew, the Christian vow; While the modest head they bow, And before the Church's face Seek the Spirit's sevenfold grace! Thus, when Jesus' Church was young, To the new elect of heaven Blessing from the Apostles' tongue, From the Apostles' hands, was given. Call'd again in Jesus' name, Prompt the Holy Spirit came, And on each regenerate head Graces more abundant shed. Be it yours, their steps to train Aye the onward path to press; That, thro' pleasure's fair domain, Thro' the desert of distress, Unseduc'd, unterrified, They may pass, nor turn aside; But toward the narrow gate Hold the right way and the strait! As they tread the tangled maze, Christ's commission'd wait beside, With his word's enlight'ning rays Charg'd their darkling course to guide. To allure and lead them on, Christ himself before is gone: Where his passing radiance glow'd, Gleams of glory mark the road. Happy they, who thus are brought, Infants to their Lord's embrace! Happy they, in childhood taught Thus to run their Christian race! Happy, who in opening youth, Grounded on the Gospel truth, To the Gospel dictates true, Faith's obedient vow renew! Happy, who in after age, Like their pattern undefil'd, Strive to go their pilgrimage With the meekness of a child. Such as from thy fount they came, Cleans'd from sin, exempt from blame, From the world's corruption free, And regenerate, Lord, by Thee! THE TEN LEPERS. Luke xvii. 11â19. It was affliction's cry! From yonder mournful group it came. They lift the voice of wailing high: They supplicate the Saviour's name. Ten men are there; diseas'd, afflicted men: And hark! at once from all the ten Pray'rs, mixt with tears, aloud for mercy crave, âO hear, and save us, Jesus! Master, hear and save!â Why stand ye thus apart, Children of sickness, woe-bested, As if the faint desponding heart Felt hope's warm flushes chill'd by dread? Come unto him, without distrust or fear! He calls the wretched to come near. âCome unto me,â he cries, âall ye distrest; On me your cares repose, and I will give you rest!â Oh no! 'tis not from him, Him who is love, ye aught can dread. 'Tis that o'er body, joint, and limb, From sole of foot to crown of head, Deep fix'd, and circling thro' the branching veins, Supreme the foul corruption reigns: That plague, still prompt alike on friend and foe, Where'er its touch can reach, its noxious taint to throw. And so the jealous Law, With care benignant, tho' severe, Forbids you, sons of grief, to draw Your brethren's healthful dwellings near; And sends you forth from Israel's camp to roam, Outcasts from men and social home; To dwell in friendless solitude alone, Or herd with those who pine with sorrows like your own. But there is one, who near Or from afar your griefs can feel: All merciful your plaints to hear; All powerful your wounds to heal. And ye have found him: and his ear hath heard Your suppliant cries: and hark! his word, âGo, shew yourselves, your offerings, to the priest: Let him, so Moses bids, the leper's health attest!â They go! Perchance the voice Once heard, âI will it, be thou clean,â Has reach'd them, and their hearts rejoice In hope of such another scene. And, lo! such scene is theirs! As vernal snow Melts in the warm sun's genial glow, Fresh health supplants the leprous tumours white, And all with rapture gaze on that delightful sight. But what is this I see? Low prostrate at the Saviour's feet, One form is thrown in ecstacy, The Author of his health to greet. Ten were the sick, the mournful, suppliant men; And mercy shone on all the ten: Ten felt that mercy make the body whole; But one alone has felt its influence on the soul. Alas, but one alone, And he of scorn'd Samaria's race, Is found with grateful heart to own, Whence flow'd that miracle of grace! But one is found to manifest abroad The glory of a healing God: But one to hear th' approving Saviour say, âThy faith hath made thee whole: arise, and go thy way!â Christian, who hear'st the tale, The secret working of thy breast Let self-exploring thought unveil, And bring thee to the leper's test! Thine was the taint of sin's foul leprosy; And, Christian, thine it was to cry On the All-merciful, his aid to crave, âO, hear and save me, Jesus! Master, hear and save!â The cry has reach'd his ears: His grace and succour have been thine; And stamp'd upon thy brow appears, Pledge of his love, salvation's sign. And dost thou own it, like the grateful one, Him, the despis'd Samaria's son? Or from the path of thanksgiving decline, With self-complacent pride, like Judah's thankless nine? O, let it not be said In climes, where Pagan idols reign, Or the false Meccan's creed is spread, Or Indian Brama's broad domain, How few of those, the Saviour's name who know, Forth, as they ought, his glory shew; Lest by the children of the unbaptiz'd God's truth be set at naught, his healing arm despis'd! 'Tis his, who rules on high, Life, strength, and health to thee to give: 'Tis thine his name to glorify, Who bids thee breathe, and move, and live! Pay then thy debt of praise for sin forgiven; Clean thoughts, pure deeds, desire of heaven: So shall his voice approving cheer thy soul, âArise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole!â BLIND BARTIMÃUS. Mark x. 46â52; Luke xviii. 35â43. Yes, it was He, who erst by Jericho, Wielding in armed hand a naked blade, To Joshua deign'd his majesty to show, In lineaments of human form array'd. âBehold,â he said, âthy enterprise to aid, I come, the Captain of the host of God:â And, as the prostrate chief obeisance paid, âSee thou approach not, save with foot unshod; For holy is the place, whereon thy step hath trod.â How passing strong his word armipotent, Devoted city, let thy bulwarks tell; When round thy walls at his commandment went, Silent and stern, the sons of Israel! Sev'n times, led on with priestly trumpets' swell, The ark of God thy ramparts compass'd round: And hark! a shout; and lo! thy walls down fell, Rent from the base at that tremendous sound; And, Jericho, thy pride lay prostrate on the ground. But thou didst rise, when time away had roll'd, Didst rise again to wealth and dignity: And He, who thee had visited of old, Again, in process of his ministry, The Captain of God's host did visit thee. But came he not in judgment, as of yore, With sheathless sword; but in his clemency, Of his rich bounty's overflowing store Some precious drops at least on thee and thine to pour. From Ephraim's mountains, whence the rocky way, Rugged and steep, to thy fair vale descends, Where the sweet balsam trails its bleeding spray, And with the purple date the palm-tree bends; He comes! His step no awful pomp attends; Nor Levi's trumpets are before him blown, Nor Israel's shout of war the welkin rends: Unnoticed yet he comes not, nor alone; But crowding throngs surround, and make his passage known. Not unobserv'd the circling crowd hath past By one, who sate the beaten way beside: A sightless man, on the world's pity cast, Who there the beggar's occupation plied. Soon as he heard, for nought his eye descried, That Jesus, He of Nazareth, past along, âLord, Jesus, Son of David, help,â he cried: And still, rebuk'd by that attendant throng, âLord, Son of David, help!â with voice more loud and strong. Lo, from his seat the mendicant hath sprung, In prompt obedience to the Lord's commands: Away the incumbrance of his garment flung, He speeds, he runs, beside the Saviour stands. âWhat wilt thou that I do?â the Lord demands: âLord, that my sight I may receive,â he cries. âReceive thy sight!â the while his gentle hands Brush with light touch the darkness-mantled eyes; âThy faith hath made thee whole,â the pitying Lord replies. I note the rapture of the wondering man, As round he cast his new-born sight amaz'd; And how from scene to scene his vision ran; And how the miracle abroad he blaz'd; And how with earnest gratitude he gaz'd, As him he follow'd, who the deed had done: And how the pow'r divine the people prais'd, Which will'd; and lo, the light unclouded shone On that way-faring man, TimÃ¦us' sightless son. And pleas'd I think, that of the admiring crowd, Who saw that miracle of mercy wrought, And told their joy with gratulations loud, Not few perchance, with heavenward feelings fraught, Might thence to tread salvation's path be taught. And pleas'd I think, that he, who once believ'd, May thence have cherish'd faith's aspiring thought, Still more and more from error's mists retriev'd; And deeply in his soul the light of truth receiv'd. But more, thy palm and balsam breathing coast As fancy wakes in musing memory's cell, Of Him, the Captain of Jehovah's host, Who wrought the wonder, I delight to tell: And think how He, at whose commandment fell, Thy walls, in righteous judgment smitten down, Yet, when among mankind he deign'd to dwell, Would fain his might with acts of mercy crown, And his compassion shew in thy once fated town. For tho', proud city, other marvel none Wrought in thy coasts the Gospel records shew; Yet this, if this alone were wrought, alone With sweeter thoughts, than those of penal woe, May link the name of haughty Jericho; And manifest, by bright example there, The gifts of grace from humble faith that flow, The effectual working of the fervent pray'r, And God's own arm reveal'd to pity and to spare. Great, passing great, and marvellous the pow'r, Which arm'd by justice, and on vengeance bent, Smote thee with unseen hand, both temple' and tow'r, That to the ground both tow'r and temple went. Nor less the pow'r, with guiding mercy blent, Which Him reveal'd, by ancient seers design'd; Him on the ministry of goodness sent, To speak the voice of comfort to mankind, To make the poor rejoice, and bless with sight the blind. O Thou, supreme to punish or to spare, To smite the harden'd, and the humble save; Be mine thy might to own; nor madly dare To slight thy goodness, or thy vengeance brave! Prince of Jehovah's host, before me wave Thy conquering banner, and increase my faith! Help, Son of David! Lord, thy aid I crave; Breathe on my soul with thy enlivening breath, And lighten thou mine eyes, nor let me sleep in death! LAZARUS RAISED. John xi. 1â46. â'Tis mine to men the living soul to give; The Resurrection and the Life am I. He that believes in me, tho' dead, shall live; He, that in me believes, shall never die.â Oft as along the church-yard path is led The simple funeral of the village swain, Or statelier rites consign the titled dead To the dark mansions of the vaulted fane; Taught by the Church, and utter'd by her priest, These solemn sounds conduct the pomp of woe; That earthly cares may mark their place of rest, And grief be warn'd its Comforter to know. Sad was the scene, where first those accents flow'd; A scene of sadness, but of comfort too: Wak'd by the promise, hope reviving glow'd; And pow'r celestial prov'd the promise true. Hard by the gate of Bethany, behold, To meet the Lord, afflicted Martha flies: Her limbs the tatter'd weeds of grief infold; Grief bares her head, and gushes from her eyes. Ask ye her cause of sorrow?ââLord, to thee,â She cries, âto heal our Lazarus we sent; Him, whom thou lovedst! For the wretched flee To thee for succour, and on thee we leant. âThou camest not; and still we watch'd and wept: Thou camest not; but still our hearts relied, Till in the silent tomb at length he slept: Hadst thou been here, my brother had not died! âHadst thou been here?âBut here thou art, and still Is there no comfort? Does no hope remain? What thou intreatest, shall not God fulfil? Shalt thou for misery plead, and plead in vain?â âThou sayst, my brother shall arise. I know, He at the resurrection shall arise: That final day shall life on all bestow.ââ The mourner speaks, the Saviour thus replies. â 'Tis mine to man the living soul to give; The Resurrection and the Life am I. He, that believes in me, tho' dead, shall live; He, that in me believes, shall never die. âBeliev'st thou this?âââYea, Lord, in thee declar'd,â She quick resumes, âthe Son of God I find: The Christ, foretold by many an ancient bard; The promis'd Life and Saviour of mankind.â Now from the house, where patient Mary still Absorb'd in grief-ful meditation sate, Hath Martha, studious of the Master's will, Call'd her in secret forth. Beyond the gate She hastes; she sees; she speaks;âone word alone, âMy brother had not died, hadst thou been here!â Then on the ground, with pleading eyes upthrown, She clasps his feet, and sheds the silent tear. With tears her grief a friendly train attend: (For prompt to Bethany from Salem's tow'rs, Of Judah's children many a kindly friend Had come, to soothe the sisters' mourning hours; And when they saw, how Mary left her home, They deem'd she rose, for such her wont, to go, Seek the sad silence of her brother's tomb, And there indulge the agony of woe.) Sees He unmov'd? Ah, no! the deep-drawn sigh, The answering tear, his troubled spirit prove. âBehold,â surpris'd the sad spectators cry, âHow deep his sorrow, and how great his love! âBut could not he, who gave the eyeless sight, Have stopp'd the arrow of impending death? He, who on darkling eyeballs pour'd the light, Could not his voice have stay'd the fleeting breath?ââ Pause not to question! Pass observant on! See where his passage to the tomb he bends! Lo! he the tomb has reach'd: and hark! a groan, Another groan, his troubled spirit sends! Now list his awful voice, which bids remove The rock-hewn cave's incumbent stone away! And list his words, which Martha's fears reprove, Lest the dead corse were now corruption's prey: âTold I not thee, that thou shouldst still behold, Couldst thou believe, my Father's glory shewn?ââ And mark, for now away the stone is roll'd, His heavenward eyes, and hear his filial tone! âI thank thee, Father; thou my voice hast heard: My voice, I knew, thou always dost receive: But now I speak, that they, who mark the word, May see thy glory, and thy Son believe.â 'Tis silence all: and then a loud command Cries, âLazarus, come forth!â and forth he came. He that was dead came forth, each foot and hand Swath'd with the grave-clothes, which inwrapt his frame, And round his face envelop'd. They had gaz'd Their last, so thought they, on that form belov'd: But when again they saw him; and amaz'd, O'erwhelm'd, astounded, saw the thought disprov'd; When they again beheld his form, his face; And heard the mandate, âLoose, and let him go:â Ev'n lips inspir'd forbear the joy to trace, And o'er the scene the veil of silence throw. Fancy might paint, with well-imagin'd skill, The strange emotions of the dead new-born: The watchful crowd what various passions fill; Believing rapture, and obdurate scorn: With lively tints a sister's feelings tell, By Martha's loud ecstatick joy exprest: Or the calm thoughts of heavenly love, that dwell Deep in the still recess of Mary's breast. But Faith the while, her eye on Jesus turn'd, Marks how for him, the sleep of death that slept, As with a brother's grief his spirit yearn'd; How well he lov'd him, and how kindly wept! She marks, to that dejected pair how well He bore the friendly, the fraternal, part; Heard with deep groans the tears that plenteous fell, And spake of comfort to the hopeless heart! But chief she marks, from Bethany afar, Or in that place of mourning, how he strove, By thought, by word, by action, to declare His Father's glory, and his filial love; To fix his followers' trust; to raise their hope; And bid them soar, with elevated eye, Above this earthly sphere's contracted scope, To other scenes and mansions in the sky! Thus taught, when sickness grieves, or fear appals, Or from our arms some friend belov'd hath fled, Or if the Church perchance her children calls To join the solemn service of the dead; To thee, O Lord, we look: we hear thee give Celestial comfort in thy kind reply, âBelieve in me; and thou, tho' dead, shalt live; Believe in me; and thou shalt never die:â We hear thee cry unto the dead, âCome forth;â We see thee set the prison'd captive free; We hail thee, image of paternal worth, Irradiate with paternal Majesty: âSaviour of men,â we pray, âthy ransom'd save! Judge of the world, accept thy suppliants' vow! Thou tread'st on death; thou triumph'st o'er the grave: The Resurrection and the Life art thou!â THE CHRISTIAN'S CONSOLATION ON THE DEATH OF FRIENDS. It has been said, and I believe, Tho' tears of natural sorrow start, 'Tis mix'd with pleasure when we grieve For those, the dearest to the heart, From whom, long lov'd, at length we part: As, by a Christian's feelings led, We lay them in their peaceful bed. Yet speak I not of those, who go The allotted pilgrimage on earth, With earthborn passions grovelling low, Enslaved to honour, avarice, mirth, Unconscious of a nobler birth: But such as tread, with loftier scope, The Christian's path with Christian hope. We grieve to think, that they again Shall ne'er in this world's pleasure share: But sweet the thought, that this world's pain No more is their's; that this world's care It is no more their lot to bear: And surely, in this scene below, The joy is balanc'd by the woe. We grieve to see the lifeless form, The livid cheek, the sunken eye: But sweet to think, corruption's worm The deathless spirit can defy, And claim its kindred with the sky. Lo! there the earthly vessel lies; Aloft the unbodied tenant flies. We grieve to think, our eyes no more That form, those features lov'd, shall trace: But sweet it is, from memory's store To call each fondly-cherish'd grace, And fold them in the heart's embrace. No bliss 'mid worldly crowds is bred, Like musing on the sainted dead. We grieve to see expir'd the race, They ran intent on works of love; But sweet to think, no mixture base, Which with their better nature strove, Shall mar their virtuous deeds above. Sin o'er their soul has lost his hold, And left them with their earthly mould. We grieve to know, that we must roam, Apart from them, each wonted spot: But sweet to think, that they a home Have gain'd, a fair and goodly lot, Enduring, and that changeth not. And who that home of freedom there Will with this prison-house compare? 'Tis grief to feel, that we behind, Sever'd from those we love, remain: 'Tis joy to hope, that we shall find, Exempt from sorrow, fear, and pain, With them our dwelling-place again. 'Tis but like them to sink to rest, With them to waken and be blest! O Thou, who form'st thy creature's mind With thoughts that chasten and that cheer; Grant me to fill my space assign'd For sojourning, a stranger, here, With holy hope and filial fear! Fear, to be banish'd far from Thee; And hope, thy face unveil'd to see! There before Thee, the Great, the Good, By angel myriads compass'd round, Made perfect by the Saviour's blood, With virtue cloth'd, with honour crown'd, The spirits of the just are found. There tears no more of sorrow start: Pain flies the unmolested heart: And life in bliss unites, whom death no more shall part. CHRIST'S TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM. Matt. xxi. 1â16. Mark xi. 1â11. Luke xix. 29â40. âHosanna to our Israel's King, to royal David's son! All blessings crown from God most High the heir of David's throne! On Him, who in Jehovah's name appears, may glory rest! Hosanna! Blessed be our King, and be his kingdom blest!â From Bethphage, and Bethany, and Olivet's fair mount, To Salem's walls, and Sion's towers, by Siloa's holy fount, By countless crowds together met the far-resounding road Is all with garments carpeted, with palm-tree branches strow'd. And ever, as along they go, they lift the joyous voice; And in the works miraculous, which God hath wrought, rejoice: And, âBlest be David's royal Son,â aloud they shout and sing, âWho cometh in Jehovah's name! Hosanna to our King!â But who is he, all in the midst of that triumphant throng, Who moves, with gentle pace and slow, like pilgrim meek, along? No stately car I see him mount; no warrior horse bestride; He sits upon an ass's colt, the patient dam beside. Yet still the thronging multitudes are aye on him intent; For him each palm-deck'd hand is wav'd; on him each eye is bent: And aye to him the shout is rais'd, as calm he passes on, âHosanna in Jehovah's name to royal David's Son!â Shout, well ye may; 'tis He, the same announc'd by God of old; Foreseen in visions far away, by far off bards foretold: âDaughter of Sion, lift,â they say, âthe gratulating cry: Shout, daughter of Jerusalem, behold, thy King is nigh.â Forth thro' his realm in righteousness majestick shall he ride, With, brighter than the morning star, salvation at his side; On him, for pride of royalty, humility shall wait; And for a steed, an ass's foal his equipage of state.â Ev'n such he comes! Then shout amain, and lift the Hosanna high, That to the sound Jerusalem may listen and reply. Tho' Israel's teachers on the scene with eyes malignant look, And Israel's scornful Pharisees his followers' zeal rebuke; Forbear not ye, who swell his pomp, the anthem loud to raise, Nor thou, Jerusalem, forbear to echo back his praise; For should thy children fail the song of jubilee to sing, Thy very stones would answer make in welcome of thy King. And see, thro' Salem's ports he goes, and Sion's hill ascends; And straightway to the temple gate, Jehovah's dwelling wends: And those that buy, and those that sell, he chases forth o'eraw'd; âWhy make ye thus God's sanctuary the lurking place of fraud?â There, as he sheds his healing rays, the Glory of the place, The blind and lame around him press to supplicate his grace: They hear, they feel, they bless the voice of goodness and of might; The lame at once their strength regain, the blind receive their sight. Then loud again the voice of praise and thanksgiving is heard; And infants catch the festive cry, and babes repeat the word: And loud the shout resounds, and loud the cries responsive ring, âHosanna to our David's Son! Hosanna to our King!â Such sounds of praise, all sweet to hear; all goodly to behold, Such sights of joy by prophecy foreshewn, by history told; The Church exulting marks: and still, as years revolving bring The appointed time to celebrate the Advent of her King; Warn'd by the seer's awakening voice, in visions of delight, She joins the train from Olivet to Sion's templed height; With eye upon her Saviour fix'd, as on the pomp proceeds, She notes his meek and lowly mien, his high and holy deeds: She sees the horse of Judah cease, and Ephraim's iron car, The battle-bow all broken lie, and quench'd the shafts of war: Peace to the world she sees him speak; and grasp with scepter'd hand The eastern and the western sea, the flood and furthest land: In thought the branching palm she waves, in emblem meet of praise; And humbly on the ground in thought the outspread garment lays: And cries, âHosanna to the heir of royal David's throne! Hosanna to our Israel's King, to God's incarnate Son!â THE FRUITLESS FIG-TREE. Matt. xxi. 18â22. Mark xi. 12â14; 20â24. Beside the way, which slowly winding leads Round the steep slope from fair Bethania's meads; There, where from Kedron's brook and shadowy dell Yon rocky mountain's fourfold summits swell, And o'er the groves, that clothe his dark-green side, Source of his name and ancient honour'd pride, Look down on Sion's pleasant hill the while, Her walls, and towered gates, and temple's marble pile: Hard by that way, where Salem's children meet, Bethania, thine, on fruitful Olivet, Lo, where in verdant pomp a fig-tree grows, And far its broad and arching foliage throws. But, though not yet the yellow harvest's time Has cropt the promise of the genial prime, In pride of worthless barrenness it stands, Nor soothes the craving taste, nor fills the outstretch'd hands. A day has past. Beside Bethania's way Again the fig-tree's form, how chang'd, survey! Still stands it there to greet the traveller's eye, But spreads no more a leafy canopy. With wither'd bark, with branches peel'd and bare, It frowns, a gloomy emblem of despair; And, where its broad and arching foliage spread, A sapless trunk alone supports a leafless head. Say, has the whirlwind from the desert torn Its pride, and clean its vernal honours shorn? Say, has the simoom's purple meteor past, And scorch'd its verdure with the burning blast? Yet nature smiles around! The oliv'd hill Gives promise of a glorious gathering still: The palm-tree blooms; the vine puts forth her spray: This blighted fig-tree stands alone destruction's prey. Thy Prophet, Israel, dealt the stroke of death Sure as the whirlwind's wing, the simoom's breath. For as he journey'd on his morning way, Intent the throes of appetite to stay; Lur'd by the prospect of the vernal shoot, Fain would he crop the fig's refreshing fruit: If aught of autumn's gleanings linger'd here, Or spring her wealth prepar'd to crown the coming year. But nor the remnant of autumnal spoil, Nor spring's rich hopes, repay the seeker's toil. Leaves, only leaves, in thick profusion round, No fruit to cheer the fainting heart is found. The Master marks the impotent display, With verdant boughs unprofitably gay: And says, âBe ever such, thou barren tree, And henceforth nevermore shall man eat fruit of thee!â The doom is said: the speaker passes on, Serene, and heedless of the wonder done. Well may ye gaze, the Prophet's humble friends, As by the tree his morrow's course he bends. Well may ye gaze, companions of his way; Note the swift ruin, and astonish'd say, âSee, Lord, the tree, whereon thy ban was laid, Has felt the stern decree, is wither'd and decay'd.â Why was it, Lord, that thou thy stern decree Didst thus pronounce on that unfruitful tree? For well I know, in every deed of thine To light our eyes the beams of wisdom shine: And well that thou, who still wert wont to fling The rays of gladness from thy healing wing, Save for the good of man's unthankful race, Wouldst not the lowest works of this fair earth deface. Was it, for so thine own blest word we read, To heavenly truths thy followers' thoughts to lead; And teach them, in affliction's trying hour, Of holy faith the organ and the power: Faith, which, upborne by strong devotion's fire, Might wing its way before thy heavenly Sire, Uproot the everlasting mountain's base, And far in yonder sea the dread memorial place? Was it that they, who long had seen thee pour Life, health, and gladness from thy mercy's store, And mark'd, where'er thy pilgrimage was bent, That goodness track'd thy footsteps as they went; Might read no less in that expressive sign, That pow'r to punish, as to save, was thine; That thine the key of suffering, as of joy; That thou, who life couldst give, couldst also life destroy? Was it to teach, that Israel, whom thy love Planted on earth, and nourish'd from above, And water'd well, and dug about the root; Yet, when thou sought'st the due return of fruit, Could naught, to meet thy just demand, bestow, But empty pomp, and insubstantial show; Might read their fate in that abandon'd tree, Devoted to decay and done to death by thee? Was it to teach, that they, whom then thy grace Should rear and foster in thy Israel's place, As wildings grafted on the parent stem; If fruitless, useless, profitless, like them, They too in flattering visions should abound, In semblance fair, a cumbrance to the ground, They too, like them, should mourn, decay'd, o'erthrown, And in that fig-tree's fate anticipate their own? Howe'er it be, while on the deed I muse, Instruction opens on my pensive views: And, oh, I cry, By thee, my Saviour, taught, Be mine the stedfast faith's aspiring thought! Be mine the pray'r, that earth's obstruction flies, And seeks its place of resting in the skies! Be mine, thy pow'r almighty to revere, Thy promis'd mercy love, thy threaten'd anger fear! Be mine to ponder thy once favour'd race, Fall'n from the height and pinnacle of grace: How, by thy justice plung'd in ruin steep, âThey sow'd the wind, and they the whirlwind reap:â To think with awe, how thou, whose vengeance fell On thine own plant, thy cherish'd Israel, Hast bid the adopted Gentile church beware, âLest God, who spar'd not Israel, spare not her!â Be mine, in this thy mercy's passing day, Close to my heart the warning voice to lay! And, O, be mine, when with paternal pow'r Again thou com'st in thy last judgment's hour, To 'scape the unprofitable servant's doom, Condemn'd, remote from Thee to endless gloom; And with thy faithful sons in glory shine, Not for my merit's sake, but, gracious Lord, for thine! THE BAND OF MEN AND OFFICERSâTHE HIGHPRIEST'S SERVANT. John xviii. 1â6. Luke xxii. 50â53. Matt. xxvi. 51â54. If e'er the Saviour's venerated form A more than wonted majesty invest, 'Tis 'mid the darkness of affliction's storm, By persecution's bitter blast distrest. Have ye not seen, when clouds the sky deform, How bright the sun emerging sinks to rest? So from the deep array of grief which throws Its gather'd blackness round âthe man of woes,â A radiance more divine his heavenly nature shows. Erewhile in pomp o'er Olivet he rode, Of Judah's sons a countless concourse nigh; Beneath his feet the crowd their garments strow'd, And wav'd the palm-tree boughs in ecstacy; In every face the gleam of rapture glow'd, From every tongue was rais'd the joyous cry: âHosanna! Blest be royal David's heir! Hosanna! Blest the King, Jehovah's care!â And still, as on he went, Hosanna fill'd the air. The scene is chang'd. No shout of triumph now Sounds from the rocky pass of Olivet: For garments strow'd, and waving palm-tree bough, Are clubs and swords, and lamps and torches, met: And lo, descending from the mountain's brow, For their meek prey the hunters spread the net; Where in the bosom of that fruitful hill, Near the dark glen of Kedron's snow-fed rill, Gethsemane, thy name the spot discovers still. The net is cast: the appointed sign is given; The traitor's kiss, which marks him for their own. Lo, where your victim stands, as if of heaven Forsaken, unbefriended, and alone! Why then before him, as a vine branch riven By the keen lightning, fall ye overthrown? Say, is the strength of that departing sun So fierce, through clouded ev'ning's shadows dun, That ye your eyes must hide his piercing rays to shun? What if, full blazing from his noonday height, He shot the brightness of his shafts abroad? What if he call'd his ministers of fight, Full twelve bright legions of the sons of God? What if, exulting in paternal might, Himself the winepress of his fury trod; Your blood beneath his trampling footsteps shed, His raiment sprinkled, and his vesture red, As with the purple grapes they who the winefat tread? As yet it may not be! His heart's blood first, (Seam'd with its drops ev'n now behold he stands!) From that well-head of holiness must burst. First of himself the word of truth demands To bear the accursed tree, the parching thirst, The open'd side, pierc'd feet, and bleeding hands. Suffice it now, your sinking hearts have felt, What pow'r essential in his person dwelt, And at the captive's feet the captors low have knelt. But tho' awhile that pow'r essential slept, In meek forbearance of his murderous foes, Of self unmindful; still his eye hath kept Unsleeping watch the sufferer's wounds to close; Meet task for him, who tears of pity wept In prospect of devoted Salem's woes; What time from yonder height he cast his eyes O'er her rich dome, her stones of giant size; And mourn'd her harden'd heart, her last sad destinies. Said I, alone, without a friend, he stood? No, not alone: his favour'd three were near, Astounded all! But he, of warmest mood, When he beheld his Lord and Master dear Betray'd, deliver'd to the deed of blood; Affection struggling with his native fear, Forth from the sheath his ready sword he drew, With outstretch'd arm quick to the rescue flew, And one the foremost smote of that malignant crew. But he for whom the blow was dealt, with joy Mark'd he the passage of the keen-edg'd steel? Ah, no! with warning voice and heart's annoy He chid the fierceness of his champion's zeal. The pow'r, he would not brandish to destroy, More quick than thought, he summons forth to heal, Not now allow'd in still repose to dwell; And his touch follows, where the weapon fell. No more: that touch is health, the maimed man is well. O ye, impatient of the Saviour's eye, Struck to the ground with retrogressive pace, There from his beams of clouded majesty Fain in the dust to hide your dazzled face; Who thence arose that marvel to descry, That deed miraculous of pow'r and grace: O, can ye still with reckless malice dare For one so kind to spread the ruthless snare, And to the death of shame that lamb-like victim bear? Ah! spare the deed! the guilty thought suppress! Ye note his pitying soul! And will not He, Who 'mid the whirl and tumult of distress, Unheedful of his own deep agony, Extends the hand of healing to redress The wound inflicted on his enemy; Say, will not He to you compassion bring, And, if his grace ye seek, about you fling, Ev'n as about her brood the hen, the gathering wing? Alas, that pow'r and goodness still should fail, The smile attractive, the repulsive frown; Nor o'er deaf ears, and self-clos'd eyes prevail! Drawn by his cords of love, or smitten down To the earth with shame, what now in Kedron's vale Ye feel, ye erst have felt on Sion's crown. But ye, who choose behind your back to throw His signs and wonders, and refuse to know The time of proffer'd weal, must meet the time of woe. And deep the woe, when he shall give the word To cause his ensign in mid heav'n be shown! Behold, he comes! About his chariot pour'd Streams of careering fire; the clouds his throne; His breath the sharpness of a two-edg'd sword; His voice, the deep-mouth'd thunder's awful tone. Like flame, his eyes; his hair, as snow-flakes white; His form, of amber; and his crown, of light; His aspect like the sun, which shineth in his might. Behold, he comes! âTis he,â ye cry, â'tis he, Whose love we slighted, and whose pow'r defied! 'Tis he: the prophet meek from Galilee, Whose works we slander'd, and his truth denied; Crown'd him with thorns, and nail'd him to a tree, The mock'd, the scorn'd, the scourg'd, the crucified! He comes! The eternal God's eternal Word: By angels worshipp'd, and by saints ador'd, By trembling fiends confest, the universal Lord!â Then to the rocks and mountains shall ye fly: He spares you now; but in that fearful hour Nor sin shall scape the lightning of his eye, Nor mercy mitigate the stroke of pow'r. Then ye, who pierc'd him, to the rocks shall cry, âFall on us, shield us, hide us from the show'r Of the Lamb's wrath! his vengeance is abroad, The day of battle of Almighty God; And who his rage shall stay? And who abide his rod?â Then other sounds from faithful hearts shall rise: The fierceness of his wrath is past away, And mercy beams effulgent from his eyes. There those who serv'd him on their earthly way He bids approach his mansions in the skies, His Father's realm of everlasting day. Then joy shall be in heav'n; and sounds of mirth From heav'n's bright sons mixt with the sons of earth; And stars of morn shall sing creation's second birth. Lo, where he sits majestically calm! Ten thousand thousand angels round him wait: And white-rob'd saints, that hold the branching palm, Souls of just men made perfect, grace his state: And many a âhymn devout and holy psalmâ Is heard the living God to gratulate: Praise to the Lamb! Joint praise to him they sing, Who sitteth on the throne; the unseen King! And with hosannas loud the heavenly regions ring. âPraise to the Lamb, in sad Gethsemane Who the rich first-fruits of his offering shed! Praise to the Lamb, on darken'd Calvary Who once for sin, a sinless victim, bled! Praise to the Lamb, who high o'er Bethany Far o'er all height on wings of cherubs fled! O Holy, Holy, Holy! Worthy He Of praise, whose breath commanded man to be! And worthy He who died from death mankind to free!â Enough! Return we now to things below, The passing trials of this world of sense; And drink our portion of the cup of woe, Once drain'd by that embodied excellence. Yet boots it oft from worldly cares to go In thought to that dread tragedy; and thence Ascend in vision to the final scene, By faith unfolded, where the Nazarene, âThe man of sorrows,â sits in sov'reignty serene. For who that garden's lonely path can pace, Or soar in thought to God's celestial mount; And muse on Him, their faith's unmoving base, Their hope's sole anchor, their salvation's fount; And what his depth of self-abasement trace, And what his height of dignity recount: And not with steadier aim, and livelier speed, And firmer patience, run the race decreed, And share the Saviour's cross, and hope to share his meed? For me who wander thro' this leafless wood, Sooth'd by the sighing of the waving trees, And thus indulge my meditative mood With thoughts that seek to profit and to please; Be such my spirit's daily, nightly food: Till my spent frame the sleep of winter seize, Again to wake, again its strength renew, My Saviour's voice to hear, his presence view, When sight shall faith confirm, and prove her vision true! THE DISCIPLE WARNED. John xxi. Yes, awful was the word, Which on thy lake, Gennesaret, Erewhile Bethsaida's fishers heard; The sinking ship, the yielding net, The draught o'erwhelming, told the Speaker's power: While, in that marvel's thrilling hour, He bade them friends, and home, and all forego, And follow him their guide, betide them weal or woe. But still more full of awe The word appear'd, when next thy strand, Gennesaret, like marvel saw, And heard pronounc'd the like command. Once and again, on Peter's ear it fell, Of life's frail joys the passing knell: And, as it pointed to the fatal tree, âBehold thy lot!â exclaimed; âbut on, and follow me!â Was it to thee alone, Simon Bar-Jona, and the band, Who share with thee the Apostles' throne, Was given the Saviour's high command? Ah, no! To each, who names the Saviour's name, And in his realm a place would claim, That high command is given, with watchful heed To mark, and follow well, whither his footsteps lead. Who followeth well his Lord? Rous'd by that voice the heart inquires. He who 'mid tortures most abhorr'd, 'Mid persecution's racks and fires, Prompt at his Lord's command concludes his race, As if he sank in sleep's embrace: His stated work of Christian duty done, Ere nature's promis'd course of life and strength be run. His end so Peter found: His witness to the Gospel borne, His outstretch'd arms the torturers bound, And girt him to the tree of scorn. All meekly passive as the sufferer stood; They girt him on the fatal rood; While 'mid his lingering pangs serene he proved, How well he copied Him, whom well and long he loved. Who followeth well his Lord? Again the anxious heart demands. He, who, submissive to his word, With eyes that watch his Master's hands, Survives with stedfast foot content to press The peaceful path of holiness; Till, at the portal of death's shadowy vale, He finds his life at once and worn-out nature fail. So the beloved John, Saved from the world's tumultuous strife, To his last goal mov'd slowly on, Along the gentle slope of life. Fain had he borne the martyr's ruthless fate: But wisdom will'd him yet to wait, Till Christ should come with late and mild release, And bid him, full of years, depart at length in peace. To each his task, his meed! To him, who smil'd betimes on death, Call'd for his Saviour's sake to bleed, To him belongs the martyr's wreath. Nor less for him, whose lengthen'd life fulfill'd The tranquil course his Saviour will'd, A crown unfading on his hoary head, With love and goodness grac'd, has glory's radiance shed. Such follow well their Lord! Not he, who with intemperate aim Presumptuous on the murderous sword, The bitter cross, the burning flame, When duty calls him not, untimely runs: Nor he, who timorously shuns The murderous sword, the cross, the flame to share, When duty calls him on to suffer and to dare. But he, whose deeds and heart, Train'd in the school of Christian lore, Aspire the Christian soldier's part To bear, as erst his Captain bore: Still ready, at his Lord's appointed time, In feeble eld, or manhood's prime, To follow, where his Leader points the way; To go, if he commands; if he commands, to stay. Then yield thee, to fulfil, Thou, who hast pledged the Christian's vow, And bear'st His name, thy Captain's will, His soldier and his servant thou! Howe'er thy days be number'd; if the prime Of early vigour see thy time Of sojourn here concluded, or thine age Creep on for many a year thro' life's long pilgrimage: Howe'er thy lot be cast; Whether 'mid gusts and angry storms, Fierce as Gennesaret's mountain blast Which the bright sunny lake deforms; Or haply 'mid fair scenes and days serene, Smooth as Gennesaret's waters sheen, Which thro' the clearness of their crystal show The sparkling pebbly sand, and painted shells below: Be He thy polar light! Be He, and His âwell doneâ thy aim! He, who thro' years' unnumbered flight, To-day, for ever, is the same: He, who can bid the tempest harmless play, And clear it with a breath away; Or save thee from the ambush'd ills that lie Beneath a tranquil sea, soft airs, and cloudless sky. THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO ALL THE WORLD. Matt. xxviii. 19, 20. Mark xvi. 15â20. Acts i. 8. Rom. x. 18. Col. i. 23. As one who loves some pleasant hill to rove, About whose foot a lovely landscape lies; Thence scans each well-known object from above, And feeds with fresh delight his curious eyes: The bow'r of bliss; the fruitful paradise; The flow'ry bank, where bees their labour ply; The silver stream, that lively health supplies; The grove of arching shade and verdant die; The lake whose crystal face reflects the azure sky: So I from this my speculative height, With dear delight the Saviour's life to trace, Throw on the scene below the excursive sight, And one by one, as each succeeds in place, With my mind's eye each storied charm embrace: Commanding might is here, compassion kind, And wisdom mild, and mercy's gentle grace; The voice that breath'd refreshment; and the mind, Where heav'n's eternal light with purest radiance shin'd. â'Tis goodly to be here;â so Peter said, When Jesus deign'd in glory to appear. To see that glory in his works display'd Pleas'd I exclaim, â'Tis goodly to be here.â So to his praise I seek a shrine to rear, Too mean, alas! and fram'd with feeble art. Yet would I fain from themes, my soul that cheer, Thoughts of delight to those I love impart, And Him my tribute pay from no unwilling heart. Then forth, my little book! But, ere thou go, Now on the threshold yet a moment hold, And once again to Him thy homage show, Whose acts of wonder, in his Book inroll'd, Thy strains, alas! have all too weakly told. One marvel more the parting lay demands, Passing those acts of wonder manifold. Not seen by faith the vast memorial stands, But by our eyes beheld, and handled by our hands. âGo!â said the Saviour; âroam the peopled earth: Go, and my Gospel to the nations teach! From Sion's mountain let the word go forth; To Judah's children, to Samaria's, preach: And thence to men of every clime and speech, Thro' towered town, thro' tented wilderness, To the world's confines let the tidings reach: Till all my precepts hear, my truth confess, The cleansing bath receive, the triune Godhead bless!â So forth they went: the simple fisherman, Fresh from the labours of Tiberias' sea; The craftsman mean; the outcast publican, Fresh from the tolls of slighted Galilee, A name akin to sin and infamy: Things foolish, weak, ignoble; things of naught, 'Gainst pow'r, and learning, rank, and dignity: The world intrench'd in its strong holds they sought, And with the world's elect the world's offscourings fought. Then pride, self-glorious, with o'erweening frown, And self-styl'd wisdom from her dizzy height On the spurn'd cross contemptuous looking down; And priestly policy with fond delight Of pomp, and gorgeous fane, and incens'd rite; And the blind rage of popular affray; And passion clinging to the deeds of night; And warlike glory; and imperial sway; Leagu'd 'gainst that feeble band in terrible array. Then came the taunt, the menace, and the scorn; The charge reproachful, and the opprobrious name; The limbs, with fetters bruis'd, with scourges torn; The house of bondage, and the stamp of shame; The cross, the sword, the stoning, and the flame; The prison'd monster from his foodless den Lanc'd on his fated prey; if aught might tame The dauntless spirit of those humble men, And to the tomb consign the Crucified again. Then too the doom, with outstretch'd limbs to feel, 'Mid the throng'd theatre's insulting sound, The fire bright blazing thro' the grated steel; Or in the lion's skin inwrapp'd and wound, To bear the torture of the worrying hound; The burning ordeal of the iron chair Fast fix'd to bide; or closely girdled round, With chin impal'd, the pitchy shirt to wear, And light the midnight gloom with strange portentous glare. Ah, spare the fearful tale! For who can love At large the instruments of death to tell, With which begirt the world's defenders strove, By superstition sharpen'd, fierce and fell, And temper'd from the armoury of hell, From its firm hold the faithful soul to fray? Ev'n at the thought of such dread spectacle, Smit to the heart with anguish and dismay, Recoiling nature shrinks, and sick'ning turns away. But they, the weak, the foolish, and the mean, What weapons brought they to the battle field? Not theirs the arms, for fleshly combats keen, Which worldly counsels to their warriors yield, And the strong sons of worldly prowess wield. But tho' unarm'd with sword or brandish'd dart, With strength unearthly for the conflict steel'd, Theirs the bold bearing of the lion heart, And theirs, not less resolv'd, the lamb-like sufferer's part. Theirs was the courage, firm, enduring, meek, More prompt to bless the smiter, than to smite: The lip of truth, which dar'd unshrinking speak In shame's, in bonds', in stripes', in death's despite, Things they had witness'd with their ears and sight: The virtuous action, and the guileless thought; The signs, and wonders, and the deeds of might; The heaven-sent eloquence; the tongue untaught: Thus arm'd, the world they brav'd, and with its champions fought. They fought, and conquer'd! At the Gospel rays Fades the reflected light of Israel, As fades the moon before the solar blaze. Samaria feels the triumph onward swell: Heav'n's queen from Sidon's ancient citadel, The god of light from Syrian Daphne fails; Egyptian Isis in her mystick cell, In her rich fane Ephesian Dian quails; And Athens' martial hill âthe unknown Godheadâ hails. Their spicy gifts Arabia's princes bring; Swart Ethiopia spreads her arms abroad; With Afric, Spain adores Judea's King; Bithynia, Pontus, hymn the Christian's God: O'er untill'd wastes by Scythian wanderers trod, In Britain's isles 'mid many an oaken grove, The blood-red priests have kiss'd Messiah's rod: And, lo, the Cross, in Rome's proud banner wove, Floats o'er the moveless rock of Capitolian Jove. Was it their arm, 'gainst the world's pow'r and pride That waged the battle, and the palm achiev'd? As well to climb heav'n's concave had they tried, Or from its base the earth's firm fabrick heav'd. 'Twas He, from whom the blind their sight receiv'd, Who gave the dumb to speak, to rise the dead, And of his prey the silenc'd fiend bereav'd: He o'er the earth life, light, and blessing shed; He bade the Gospel speed, and he the Gospel sped. As when his will a stately tree would raise, Meet plume to grace some lofty Carmel's brow, In earth's soft lap the slender seed he lays; And now the bursting germ shoots forth, and now The stem up-springs, the leaf unfolds, the bough Spreads here and there; and still, as on it grows, (We sleep and rise the while, and know not how,) Wide and more wide its branching arms it throws, And in its spacious shade the shelt'ring birds repose:â Or would he fain a great Euphrates make, He bids the waste a trickling spring distill; On some lone rock, from some unnotic'd lake, Wells forth from crag to crag a scanty rill; With runnels swoln from many a neighbouring hill, Now broad, and deep, and strong, the waters glide, And scorning all control, the valley fill, Where meadows smile, and cattle graze beside; The exulting shepherd hails the fertilizing tide:â So by his wisdom sown, tho' small at first, The goodly cedar of the Gospel grew; So by his care, a gentle streamlet, nurst, The Gospel flood afar its waters threw: The gather'd nations to the covert flew, O'erjoy'd repose and shelter there to find; The sons of men, instinct with being new, Drank of its wave, and on its banks reclin'd, And blest the all-forming Hand, the all-disposing Mind. Then praise to Him by each, by all, be paid, Whose sires obscur'd by pagan darkness lay, Or in the twilight of Judea's shade, What time he gave his glorious Gospel way! And as his saints the mighty deeds display, Which one by one the Saviour's glory tell, Still fail we not, amid the bright array, To mark, the breast while conscious raptures swell, That one, the crown of all, that last, best, miracle! Yes! 'tis by that, that crowning act of might, Which made his Gospel to the nations known, That now we walk amid celestial light, âTo moles and batsâ our fathers' âidols thrown:â Nor the deep forest seek, and mountain lone, Where, shed by sacred hands, a brother's blood Stream'd in red torrents from the altar-stone; Or huge, and blazing in the fiery flood, With living victims throng'd the osier'd image stood. That other offerings, other rites, arose, Than such as steep'd in gore her Woden's throne, Thanks to that pow'r enlighten'd Britain owes, Whence o'er her isles the Gospel rays were sown. And O! by all, who that blest Gospel own, Be fruitage, worthy of the heavenly lore, Pure hearts, chaste words, and holy actions shewn; Be theirs that pearl of mighty price to store, Jehovah God obey, and Him in Christ adore! Now forth, my little book, and fare thee well! Thine has it been, in many an hour of gloom, 'Mid anxious thoughts, that on the spirit dwell, To make for high and heavenly musings room, And open gleams of sunshine, which illume Our darkling path: and thine on this fair scene In brighter hours to shed a lovelier bloom, To clothe with purer light yon azure sheen, And lend the verdant earth a softer, sweeter green. Farewell! And, O! if haply thou mayst wake Congenial feelings in some other breast, Cause on the heart a fairer view to break, Or lull the storm of anxious thought to rest, For those most wish'd for, whom I love the best; Joy to the poet! But to Him belong Alone the glory, and His name be blest, Whose acts of might have caus'd the poet's song, Whose will can raise the mean, and make the feeble strong! Yes, if to cheer the drooping heart, or raise The earth-prest soul to holy things above, If aught may flow from these unboastful lays To grace His deeds of majesty and love; Praise to the Giver! Lord, if thou approve, Well it sufficeth. But should thy dread frown The rash emprise or worthless act reprove, Vain were the meed of dearly-earn'd renown, The world's applausive shout, the poet's laurel crown. Alas, that man should e'er with guilty stain Blur the fair form of heaven-born Poesy, Debasing God's pure gift with dross profane Of passion vile, and mad impiety! Fair is her form, when, from pollution free, On virtue's ear her kindred strain she pours: But then most fair, when, sanctified by Thee, Fountain of good, on seraph wing she soars, And seeks her native home, and meekly there adores! TO A? C? M? RECOVERING FROM LONG AND SEVERE ILLNESS Jan. 1832. I bade for her, my nearest, dearest friend, Preluding notes of salutation rise: What hinders, that from kindred sympathies My closing strains to thee, Alicia, send A brother's greeting? She will pleas'd commend The verse, that flowing from affection tries To give thee pleasure, and the charities Fraternal with connubial thus to blend. Be then this lay of valediction thine! That 'mid the pains, wherewith high God hath prov'd Long while thy patient spirit, verse of mine Hath ever from thy couch a thorn remov'd, Glads me; and prompts me thus thy name to join With those thou lovest, sister well belov'd! TO A? M? A BIRTH DAY MEMORIAL OF PATERNAL AFFECTION Feb. 14, 1832. Named I the charities, which men cement, Of husband and of brother, sweetly set In happy union; and could I forget That other bond, by man's Creator sent To be of life the strength and ornament, The parent's dear relation? Ah! not yet So dull of sense am I, nor of my debt Unmindful for the good my God hath lent. Let then my book thy name, my daughter, bear! So when perchance, from worldly cares to free Thy thoughts, thou view'st the scenes depictur'd there Of love divine, 'twill glad thy heart to see, That still thy image in my mind I bear, In body, not in spirit, far from thee. Yes, ever present to my thoughtful mind, Take thou a father's blessing! And when sleep Thy parents' eyes in deep repose shall steep, Their spirits to their Maker's hand resign'd; May He, who came to ransom lost mankind, My Agatha in his protection keep, From husband, brothers, children long to reap Earth's best delights, with thoughts of heav'n refin'd; Nor fail thee there, where those dear charities, Which shed sweet influence on this world below, Sublim'd, and purg'd from all alloy, shall rise, And touch'd with heav'n's unsullied radiance glow; And man in God's celestial paradise Shall angels' love in angels' likeness know! TO W? B? M? AND F? W? M? Brothers by blood, and by affection too, Tho' many a league your persons now divide, This far off floating on the ocean tide, That bounding to domestick scenes his view: Pleas'd I recall to mind, how, in the new Day-spring of life, together side by side Your sports and tasks with brothers' love ye plied, And your first lore from lips parental drew. And pleas'd I think, how through succeeding time Each bosom still that early impress bears Of love fraternal: while nor change of clime, Pursuits, or habits; nor the joys and cares Of life's still varying drama; nor the prime Of active manhood, childhood's pledge impairs. What different states has the great God assign'd To you, my sons! To one, His hallow'd dome, A priest, to serve; unfold His sacred tome; His flock to pasture, and the wanderers find: O'er the round world meanwhile the ardent mind Of enterprise the other prompts to roam; No spot of earth that he may call his home, His dwelling with the billows and the wind. Strange law of nature's Lord, which thus imprest Fraternal minds with such discordant choice! But kind as strange, which bids each brother's breast, Of taste discordant, still to nature's voice Respond; and still, caressing and carest, Each with the other suffer and rejoice! Brothers by blood, and by affection too, It cheers your father's spirit to have view'd, How on your souls that bond of brotherhood Holds its firm grasp! Nor less that fondness due Ye deal to others; chiefly her, for you Who felt a mother's cares; and her who woo'd With you life's dawning pleasures, and pursu'd Each fresh delight that round your pathway flew! Past are those scenes, the dream of yesterday! But leave they no unpleasing trace behind, Nor yet unfruitful; if the thoughts, that stray Thro' memory's cells, to the deep yearnings join'd Of inborn kindness, fix with firmer stay Life's dear relations in each kindred mind. Such scenes of childhood in your memories dwell, (For oft I've heard 'mid graver talk prevail The well-stor'd wonders of the nursery tale,) Whence more perchance with love your bosoms swell, Fraternal, filial: but whate'er the well, Which pours such streams of gladness thro' the vale Of life, with joy those gladdening streams I hail, Which of my sons the strong attachment tell. Have then your portion in these farewell lays, A father's pray'r withal; that thou may'st go, The Christian Pastor, in the Gospel's ways, And to thy flock the paths of comfort show; And thou, the Sailor, in the Gospel's rays, The only polestar of thy safety know! TO THE READER. To thee, kind Reader, who hast travell'd on Thus far companion of my pensive Muse, One word is due, which thy indulgence sues For her last lays, a father's benison. One word: for if thy heart benignant own The charm which life's dear charities diffuse, Such grace thou wilt not to that one refuse: Ten thousand else were seed on Snowdon sown. Yet not unmeet is such domestick lay To speak the triumph of the Saviour's reign; Who charg'd his Prophet, Herald of his way, The link paternal in the golden chain Of love to strengthen; and, for His great day, Father and child in mutual concord train. Mal. iv. 5, 6. Luke i. 17. For what remains:âfor health to Israel given If Moses bade the choral timbrels ring, And the sweet Psalmist hymn'd with echoing string God's glory witness'd by the expanse of heaven; Slight blame she fears for having meekly striven, Led by his word, of sickness quell'd to sing, And nature sway'd by heav'n's incarnate King, And death and hell subdued, and sin forgiven. Adieu! she quits thee now; but first would plead, What at thy hands her parting numbers claim. She seeks to please, and so the heart to lead To faith and love: if holy be her aim, Judge her not harshly; rather bid God-speed, And wish her welfare in the Saviour's name! THE END.</field>
