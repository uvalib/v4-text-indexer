      <field name="fulltext">VOL I. [“The mystery of the Turnspit in the Wheel] “The mystery of the Turnspit in the Wheel, He understood not but admired with zeal.” “No longer he regrets his native groves, His wonted haunt and his accustom'd rill; He views the bakehouse, scullery, and stoves, And from the leathern jack delights to swill. He saw the Baker putting in some loaves, And being quick and eager in his will, He thrust him in, half-way, for an experiment— It was not malice, it was only merriment. “The monks had purchased for their chapel floor Some foreign marbles, squares, of white and black; It lay where it was left, upon the shore, Till Ascopart convey'd it, on his back, Through miry roads, eleven leagues and more, Poked, like backgammon men, into a sack; Went to the wood and kill'd a brace of bears, Then drank six quarts of ale, and so to prayers. “Besides all this he mended their mill dam, Digging a trench to turn aside the flood; And brought huge piles of wood to drive and ram, Jamm'd in with stones to make it sound and good. The story looks a little like a flam, But in five days he built five stacks of wood, To serve the convent for five winters' fire, As high as their own convent-church or higher. “But most he show'd the goodness of his heart In slaughtering swine and oxen for the year; From dawn to sunset there was Ascopart, With sweat, and blood, and garbage in a smear. The butcher pointed out the rules of art— ‘I'll smite 'um,’ quoth the Giant, ‘never fear.’ The clapper of the great old broken bell He bang'd about him with, and down they fell. “Pigs, when their throats were cut, amused him most— All cantering and curvetting in a ring; To see them as they jostled and they cross'd, He swore it was a pastime for a king.— Laugh'd and laid wagers and cried out, ‘ware post!’ And as the monks were teaching him to sing, He criticized their squeaking, and found fault— ‘Come Pig! now for a holding note in Alt.’ “With such a size, and mass of limbs, and trunk, And his loins girded with a hempen string, He look'd, and might have been, a lordly monk; Therefore I think it an unlucky thing That at their vespers he was always drunk, And that he never would be taught to sing, But only saunter'd from the kitchen fire, To howl and make a hubbub in the quire. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MICROCOSM. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1786. “I demens et sævas curre per Alpes, Ut Pueris placeas et declamatio fias.”— Juvenal. “Climb o'er the Alps, thou rash, ambitious fool, To please the boys, and be a theme at school.”— Dryden. I. Within the sounding quiver's hollow womb Repose the darts of praise and harmony; Goddess, draw forth the chosen shaft; at whom Shall the swift arrows of the muses fly? By the great almighty mind For man's highly favour'd race Various blessings were design'd, Bounties of superior grace; Here the fat and fertile ground Waves the flood of harvest round; Or fervid wine's ecstatic juice Cluster-curved vines produce; A sullen land of lazy lakes Rhine slowly winding to the ocean makes, This rescued from the eager wave Human art has dared to save, While o'er each foggy pool and cheerless fen Hums the busy buzz of men. A warlike nation bent on deathful deeds From daring actions safety seeks, and fame, Rush through the ranks, where'er the battle bleeds, Or whirl their neighing coursers through the flame. The Indian youth beneath the shade More loves repose and peace, And underneath his plantain laid Sings indolence and ease. II. Thus far with unerring hand All ruling providence has plann'd, Thus far impartial to divide Nor all to one, nor one to all denied. But Order, heav'n-descended queen, Where'er you deign to go, Alone you fix the bounds between Our happiness and woe, Nor wealth, nor peace, nor without thee Heav'n's first best bounty, Liberty, Can bless our native land. Then come, O nymph! and o'er this isle Dispense thy soul-subduing smile, And stretch thy lenient hand. III. Before time was, before the Day Shot through the skies his golden ray, A sightless mass, a wasteful wild Tumultuous gulph, was all this fair creation, Till you the shapeless chaos reconciled, Each part commanding to its proper station! Then hills upheaved their verdant head, Above a purer sky was spread, And Ocean floated in his ample bed; Then first creeping to the main Rivers drew their tortuous train; Then from her fertile womb the earth Brought forth at one ample birth, All that through the waste of sky Borne on oary pinions fly, Or through the deep's dark caverns roam, And wallowing dash the sea to foam. Tutor'd by your guiding sway, The planets trace their pathless way, The seasons in their order'd dance In grateful interchange advance! But when, O Goddess, wilt thou deign O'er favour'd man to stretch thy reign? Then shall sedition's tempest cease, The dashing storm be hush'd to peace, The angry seas no longer roar, But gently rolling kiss the shore, While from the wave-worn rock the troubled waters pour. IV. When poised athwart the lurid air, The sword of vengeance pours a sanguine ray, Or comets from their stream of blazing hair Shake the blue pestilence, and adverse sway Of refluous battle, o'er some high-viced land; Through the sick air the power of poison flies, By gentler breezes now no longer fann'd, Sultry and still; the native breathes and dies. Yet often free from selfish fear The son attends his father's bed, Nor will disdain the social tear In pleasing painful mood to shed.— When childing pine and cheerless penury, Stretch o'er some needy house their wither'd hand, Where modest want alone retires to die, Yet social love has shed her influence bland, To cheer the sullen gloom of poverty. For 'tis decreed, that every social joy, In its partition should be multiplied, Still be the same, nor know the least alloy, Though sympathy to thousands should divide Our pleasures; but when urged by dire distress, The grief by others felt is made the less. V. Not so the ills sedition sows, Midst sever'd friends, and kindred foes; When the horrid joy of all Embitters ev'ry private fall. Creeping from her secret source Sedition holds her silent course, With wat'ry weeds and sordid sedge Skirting her unnoted edge, Till scorning all her former bounds She sweeps along the fertile grounds; And as in sullen solemn state she glides, Receives into her train the tributary tides; Then rushing headlong from some craggy steep She pours impetuous down and hurries to the deep. Ah! luckless he, who o'er the tide Shall hope his fragile bark to guide; While secure his sail is spread The waves shall thunder o'er his head; But if, long tempest-tost, once more His crazy bark regain the shore, There shall he sit and long lament His youthful vigour vainly spent; And others warn, but warn, alas! in vain, In unambitious safety to remain. Then happy he who to the gale Nor trusts too much the varying sail, Nor rashly launching forth amain Attempts the terrors of the wat'ry plain; But watchful, wary, when he sees The ocean black beneath the breeze, The cheerless sky with clouds o'erspread, And darkness gath'ring round his head, Trusts not too far, but hastes to seek The shelter of some winding creek; Thence sees the waves by whirlwinds tost, And rash ambition's vessel lost; Hears the mad pilot late deplore, The shifting sail, the faithless oar, And hears the shriek of death, the shriek that's heard no more. MISCELLANIES. 1785—1792. VERSES WRITTEN AT SIXTEEN. “Ingenium ingens inculto latet hoc sub corpore.” Philosophers of old dispute ye Whether mere virtue without beauty, Unhewn, unpolish'd, better is Than vitium cum illecebris. The man who, twenty years undusted, In books and single life has rusted, Contemns the world, commends his college, And talks of solid sense and knowledge. For through a medium form'd by reading, Unrectified by sense or breeding, Who views the world, but must despise? Who is there will not trust his eyes? And though ill-form'd, who will suspect In his own judgment a defect? A man brought hither from the moon (For rhyme's sake) in an air balloon, Would stare to see our people throw Away their victuals when they sow; But this good soul who saw corn sowing, Yet had no notion of its growing, Were he to laugh at us, I trust, His censure would be thought unjust. Who hears a story but half told, Who knows no learning but the old, Their judgments equally must fail In censuring the times or tale: The world must his contempt despise Who looks at them with borrow'd eyes. Now let us hear what says the beau— “Politeness is a passe pour tout. “Latin and Greek, old fogrum stuff, “Don't signify a pinch of snuff.” Suppose a house built, if you please, With cornice, architrave, and frieze, Entablature of colonnade, And knicknacks of the building trade; Grand and complete, it draws the eye Of passengers a-riding by; The very connoisseurs allow No palace makes a nobler show; Yet you would think the man but silly Who having built this sumptuous villa, Had not a tolerable room To show his friends in when they come This is the case of many a beau Who gives up all for glare and show. Outside and front all fine and burnish'd, But the inner rooms are thinly furnish'd. Suppose another's mind so grovelling That a most execrable hovel in He, strangely whimsey-struck, should like To fix the pictures of Vandyke; I say, if such a den he chose, Each passer-by would turn his nose. But should he chance to enter in, 'Twere then, indeed, another thing. He'd talk of attitudes and contours, Show his own taste and flatter yours; And though a little odd your plan, Call you a reasonable man; But thousands that remain without Think you a madman past all doubt. This is the only difference on't, To those who know you or who don't; To seem a fool, the difference this 'Twixt pedant and 'twixt coxcomb is; The man of real worth and merit, The praise of either will inherit. EPITAPH ON PLAUTUS. Postquam morte datu'st, &amp;c. When comic Plautus first departed, The scene was left, the stage deserted; And wit and merriment, together With mirth and humour, fled for ever. EPITAPH ON NÆVIUS. Mortalis immortalis flere, &amp;c. If goddesses for mortal men might weep, A tear on Nævius should the Muse bestow; Since Rome no longer does her language keep, Now he is destined to the shades below. METRICAL VERSION OF AN ODE ON ATHELSTAN'S VICTORY. From the Saxon. The mightiest of alle manne, Was the gude kinge Athelstan, Alle his knytis to hir medis Weren riche and ryal wedis. Edmond his brother, was a Knyt Comelich, brave, and fair to syht. At Brunenbruc in stour they faught; Fiercer fray was never wraught. Maille was split, and helmis roven, The wall of shieldis down they cloven: The Thanis which cold with Edmond fare To meet the fomen well were yare. For it was comen to hem of kynde Hir londis and tresoúrs to fend. The kempis, whych was of Irlond, On ilka daie, on ilka strond, Weted with blude, and wounded, fell Rapely smatin with the stell. Grislich on the grund they groned; Aboven, alle the hyls resounéd. What for laboúr, and what for hete, The kempis swate til they wer wete. From morrow til the close of day, Was the tyme of that journée. Monie mon from Dacie sprong The deth tholid, I underfong. The Scottis fell in that bataille, Whyche wer forwerid of travaille. The West Saxonis wer ware, When their foen away wold fare; As they fled they did hem sewe Wyth ghazand swerdis, that wel couth hew. The cokins they n' olden staie, For thir douten of that fraye. The Mercians fought, I understond; There was gamen of the hond. Alle that with Anlaff hir way nom, Over the seas in the shippes wome, And the five sonnes of the kynge, Fel mid dint of swerd-fightinge, His seven erlis died alswo; Many Scottes wer killed tho. The Normannes, for their migty bost, Went hame with a lytyl host. The Kynge and frode syked sore For hir kempis whyche wer forlore: The Kynge and frode to schyppe gan flee, Wyth mickel haste, but hir meguie. Constantine gude, and Anlaff, Lytyl bost hadde of the laif. Maie he nat glosen, ne saie But he was right wel appaie. In Dacie of that gaming Monie wemen hir hondis wring. The Normannes passed that rivere, Mid hevy hart, and sory chere. The brothers to Wessex yode; Leving the crowen, and the tode, Hawkes, doggis, and wolves tho; Egles, and monie other mo, With the ded men for their mede On hir corses for to fede. Sen the Saxonis first come In schippes over the sea-fome, Of the yeres that ben forgone, Greater bataile was never none. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ANTI-JACOBIN. IMITATION. INSCRIPTION FOR THE DOOR OF THE CELL IN NEWGATE, WHERE MRS. BROWNRIGG, THE PRENTICE-CIDE, WAS CONFINED PREVIOUS TO HER EXECUTION. November 20, 1797. For one long term, or e'er her trial came, Here Brownrigg linger'd. Often have these cells Echoed her blasphemies, as with shrill voice She screamed for fresh Geneva. Not to her Did the blithe fields of Tothill, or thy street, St. Giles, its fair varieties expand; Till at the last, in slow-drawn cart, she went To execution. Dost thou ask her crime? She whipp'd two female 'prentices to death, And hid them in the coal-hole. For her mind Shaped strictest plans of discipline. Sage schemes! Such as Lycurgus taught, when at the shrine Of the Orthyan goddess he bade flog The little Spartans; such as erst chastised Our Milton, when at college. For this act Did Brownrigg swing. Harsh laws! But time shall come, When France shall reign, and laws be all repeal'd! Canning and Frere. IMITATION. SAPPHICS. THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE KNIFE-GRINDER. Friend of Humanity. Needy Knife-grinder! whither are you going? Rough is the road, your wheel is out of order— Bleak blows the blast;—your hat has got a hole in't, So have your breeches! “Weary Knife-grinder! little think the proud ones, Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike- -road, what hard work 'tis crying all day “Knives and “Scissars to grind O!” “Tell me, Knife-grinder, how you came to grind knives? Did some rich man tyrannically use you? Was it the 'squire? or parson of the parish? Or the attorney? “Was it the 'squire, for killing of his game? or Covetous parson, for his tythes distraining? Or roguish lawyer, made you lose your little All in a lawsuit? “(Have you not read the Rights of Man, by Tom Paine?) Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids, Ready to fall, as soon as you have told your Pitiful story.” Knife-grinder. “Story! God bless you! I have none to tell, sir, Only last night a-drinking at the Chequers, This poor old hat and breeches, as you see, were Torn in a scuffle. “Constables came up for to take me into Custody; they took me before the justice; Justice Oldmixon put me in the parish- —Stocks for a vagrant. “I should be glad to drink your Honour's health in A pot of beer, if you will give me sixpence; But for my part, I never love to meddle With politics, sir.” Friend of Humanity. “I give thee sixpence!

Attempted from the French. Tune—“O'er the vine-covered hills and gay regions of France.” I. From the blood-bedew'd valleys and mountains of France, See the genius of Gallic invasion advance! Old ocean shall waft her, unruffled by storm, While our shores are all lined with the Friends of Reform. Confiscation and Murder attend in her train, With meek-eyed Sedition, the daughter of Paine; While her sportive Poissardes with light footsteps are seen To dance in a ring round the gay Guillotine. II. To London, “the rich, the defenceless,” she comes— Hark! my boys, to the sound of the Jacobin drums! See Corruption, Prescription, and Privilege fly, Pierced through by the glance of her blood-darting eye. While patriots, from prison and prejudice freed, In soft accents shall lisp the Republican creed, And with tri-colour'd fillets and cravats of green, Shall crowd round the altar of Saint Guillotine. III. See the level of Freedom sweeps over the land— The vile Aristocracy's doom is at hand! Not a seat shall be left in a House that we know, But for Earl Buonaparte and Baron Moreau. But the rights of the Commons shall still be respected, Buonaparte himself shall approve the elected; And the Speaker shall march with majestical mien, And make his three bows to the grave Guillotine. IV. Two heads, says our proverb, are better than one, But the Jacobin choice is for Five Heads or none. By Directories only can Liberty thrive; Then down with the One, boys! and up with the Five! How our bishops and judges will stare with amazement, When their heads are thrust out at the National Casement! When the National Razor has shaved them quite clean, What a handsome oblation to Saint Guillotine! Canning and Frere. THE SOLDIER'S FRIEND. DACTYLICS. Come, little Drummer Boy, lay down your knapsack here: I am the soldier's friend—here are some books for you; Nice clever books by Tom Paine, the philanthropist.

[Exit Drummer Boy, with handbills, and half-a-crown. Manet Soldier's Friend.

January 8, 1798. You have heard of Rewbell, That demon of hell, And of Barras, his brother Director; Of the canting Lepaux, And that scoundrel Moreau, Who betray'd his old friend and protector. Would you know how these friends, For their own private ends, Would subvert our religion and throne?— Do you doubt of their skill To change laws at their will?— You shall hear how they treated their own. 'Twas their pleasure to look, In a little blue book, At the code of their famed legislation, That with truth they might say, In the space of one day They had broke every law of the nation. The first law that they see, Is “the press shall be free!” The next is “the trial by jury:” Then, “the people's free choice;” Then, “the members' free voice”— When Rewbell exclaim'd in a fury— “On a method we'll fall For infringing them all— We'll seize on each printer and member: No period so fit For a desperate hit, As our old bloody month of September. “We'll annul each election Which wants our correction, And name our own creatures instead. When once we've our will, No blood we will spill, (Let Carnot be knock'd on the head). “To Rochefort we'll drive Our victims alive, And as soon as on board we have got 'em, Since we destine the ship For no more than one trip, We can just make a hole in the bottom. “By this excellent plan, On the true Rights of Man, When we've founded our fifth Revolution, Thou England's our foe, An army shall go To improve her corrupt Constitution. “We'll address to the nation A fine proclamation, With offers of friendship so warm: Who can give Buonaparté A welcome so hearty As the friends of a thorough reform?” Canning, Ellis, and Frere.

Whether some great, supreme, o'er-ruling Power Stretch'd forth its arm at Nature's natal hour, Composed this mighty Whole with plastic skill, Wielding the jarring elements at will? Or whether sprung from Chaos' mingling storm, The mass of matter started into form? Or Chance o'er earth's green lap spontaneous fling The fruits of autumn and the flowers of spring? Whether material substance unrefined, Owns the strong impulse of instinctive mind, Which to one centre points diverging lines, Confounds, refracts, invig'rates, and combines? Whether the joys of earth, the hopes of heaven, By man to God, or God to man, were given? If virtue leads to bliss, or vice to woe? Who rules above? or who reside below?” Vain questions all—shall man presume to know? On all these points, and points obscure as these, Think they who will,—and think whate'er they please! Let us a plainer, steadier theme pursue— Mark the grim savage scoop his light canoe; Mark the dark rook, on pendant branches hung, With anxious fondness feed her cawing young.— Mark the fell leopard through the desert prowl, Fish prey on fish, and fowl regale on fowl;— How Lybian tigers' chawdrons Love assails, And warms, midst seas of ice, the melting whales;— Cools the crimpt cod, fierce pangs to perch imparts, Shrinks shrivell'd shrimps, but opens oysters' hearts; Then say, how all these things together tend To one great truth, prime object, and good end? First—to each living thing, whate'er its kind, Some lot, some part, some station is assign'd. The feather'd race with pinions skim the air— Not so the mackerel, and still less the bear: This roams the wood, carniv'rous, for his prey! That with soft roe pursues his watery way: This slain by hunters, yields his shaggy hide; That, caught by fishers, is on Sundays cried.— But each contented with his humble sphere, Moves unambitious through the circling year; Nor e'er forgets the fortunes of his race, Nor pines to quit, or strives to change, his place. Ah! who has seen the mailed lobster rise, Clap his broad wings, and soaring claim the skies? When did the owl, descending from her bow'r Crop, 'midst the fleecy flocks, the tender flow'r; Or the young heifer plunge, with pliant limb, In the salt wave, and fish-like strive to swim? The same with plants—potatoes 'tatoes breed— Uncostly cabbage springs from cabbage seed; Lettuce to lettuce, leeks to leeks succeed; Nor e'er did cooling cucumbers presume To flow'r like myrtle, or like violets bloom. —Man only,—rash, refined, presumptuous man, Starts from his rank, and mars creation's plan. Born the free heir of nature's wide domain, To art's strict limits bounds his narrow'd reign; Resigns his native rights for meaner things, For faith and fetters—laws, and priests, and kings. (To be continued.) Canning. February 26, 1798. See the rude savage, free from civil strife, Keeps the smooth tenour of his guiltless life; Restrain'd by none, save Nature's lenient laws, Quaffs the clear stream, and feeds on hips and haws. Light to his daily sports behold him rise! The bloodless banquet health and strength supplies. Bloodless not long—one morn he haps to stray Through the lone wood—and close beside the way, See the gaunt tiger tear his trembling prey; Beneath whose gory fangs a leveret bleeds, Or pig—such pig as fertile China breeds. Struck with the sight, the wondering savage stands, Rolls his broad eyes, and clasps his lifted hands! Then restless roams—and loathes his wonted food; Shuns the salubrious stream, and thirsts for blood. By thought matured, and quicken'd by desire, New arts, new arms, his wayward wants require. From the tough yew a slender branch he tears, With self-taught skill the twisted grass prepares; Th' unfashion'd bow, with labouring efforts bends In circling form, and joins th' unwilling ends. Next some tall reed he seeks—with sharp-edged stone Shapes the fell dart, and points with whiten'd bone. Then forth he fares—around in careless play, Kids, pigs, and lambkins unsuspecting stray. With grim delight he views the sportive band, Intent on blood, and lifts his murderous hand, Twangs the bent bow—resounds the fateful dart Swift-wing'd, and trembles in a porker's heart. Ah, hapless porker! what can now avail Thy back's stiff bristles, or thy curly tail? Ah! what avail those eyes so small and round, Long pendent ears, and snout that loves the ground? Not unrevenged thou diest!—in after times From thy spilt blood shall spring unnumber'd crimes. Soon shall the slaught'rous arms that wrought thy woe, Improved by malice, deal a deadlier blow; When social man shall pant for nobler game, And 'gainst his fellow man the vengeful weapon aim. As love, as gold, as jealousy inspires, As wrathful hate, or wild ambition fires, Urged by the statesman's craft, the tyrant's rage, Embattled nations endless wars shall wage, Vast seas of blood the ravaged field shall stain, And millions perish—that a king may reign! For blood once shed, new wants and wishes rise; Each rising want invention quick supplies. To roast his victuals is man's next desire, So two dry sticks he rubs, and lights a fire; Hail, fire, &amp;c. &amp;c. Canning. CANTO TWENTY-THIRD. CONTENTS.

EXTRACT. Hail! beauteous lands that crown the Southern Seas; Dear happy seats of Liberty and Ease! Hail! whose green coasts the peaceful ocean laves, Incessant washing with its watery waves! Delicious islands! to whose envied shore Thee, gallant Cook! the ship Endeavour bore. There laughs the sky, there zephyr's frolic train, And light-wing'd loves, and blameless pleasures reign: There, when two souls congenial ties unite, No hireling Bonzes chant the mystic rite; Free every thought, each action unconfined, And light those fetters which no rivets bind. There in each grove, each sloping bank along, And flow'rs and shrubs and odorous herbs among, Each shepherd clasp'd, with undisguised delight, His yielding fair one,—in the Captain's sight; Each yielding fair, as chance or fancy led, Preferr'd new lovers to her sylvan bed. Learn hence, each nymph, whose free aspiring mind Europe's cold laws, and colder customs bind— O! learn, what Nature's genial laws decree— What Otaheite is, let Britain be! Of whist or cribbage mark th' amusing game— The partners changing, but the sport the same. Else would the gamester's anxious ardour cool, Dull every deal, and stagnant every pool. Yet must one Man, with one unceasing Wife, Play the long rubber of connubial life. Yes! human laws, and laws esteem'd divine, The generous passion straighten and confine; And, as a stream, when art constrains its course, Pours its fierce torrent with augmented force, So, Passion narrow'd to one channel small, Unlike the former, does not flow at all. For Love then only flaps his purple wings, When uncontroll'd by priestcraft or by kings. Such the strict rules, that, in these barbarous climes, Choke youth's fair flow'rs, and feelings turn to crimes: And people every walk of polish'd life With that two-headed monster, Man and Wife. Yet bright examples sometimes we observe, Which from the general practice seem to swerve; Such as presented to Germania's view, A Kotzebue's bold emphatic pencil drew: Such as, translated in some future age, Shall add new glories to the British stage; —While the moved audience sit in dumb despair, “Like Hottentots, and at each other stare.” With look sedate, and staid beyond her years, In matron weeds a Housekeeper appears. The jingling keys her comely girdle deck— Her 'kerchief colour'd, and her apron check. Can that be Adelaide, that “soul of whim,” Reform'd in practice, and in manner prim? —On household cares intent, with many a sigh She turns the pancake, and she moulds the pie; Melts into sauces rich the savoury ham: From the crush'd berry strains the lucid jam; Bids brandied cherries, by infusion slow, Imbibe new flavour, and their own forego, Sole cordial of her heart, sole solace of her woe! While still, responsive to each mournful moan, The saucepan simmers in a softer tone. Canning and Frere. THE LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES. A MATHEMATICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL POEM. INSCRIBED TO DR. DARWIN.

CANTO I. Stay your rude steps, or e'er your feet invade The Muses' haunts, ye sons of War and Trade! Nor you, ye legion fiends of Church and Law, Pollute these pages with unhallow'd paw! Debased, corrupted, grovelling, and confined, No Definitions touch your senseless mind; To you no Postulates prefer their claim, No ardent Axioms your dull souls inflame; For you, no Tangents touch, no Angles meet, No Circles join in osculation sweet! For me, ye Cissoids, round my temples bend Your wandering curves; ye Conchoids extend; Let playful Pendules quick vibration feel, While silent Cyclois rests upon her wheel; Let Hydrostatics, simpering as they go, Lead the light Naiads on fantastic toe; Let shrill Acoustics tune the tiny lyre; With Euclid sage fair Algebra conspire; The obedient pulley strong Mechanics ply, And wanton Optics roll the melting eye! I see the fair fantastic forms appear, The flaunting drapery, and the languid leer; Fair sylphish forms—who, tall, erect, and slim, Dart the keen glance, and stretch the length of limb; To viewless harpings weave the meanless dance, Wave the gay wreath, and titter as they prance. Such rich confusion charms the ravish'd sight, When vernal Sabbaths to the Park invite. Mounts the thick dust, the coaches crowd along, Presses round Grosvenor Gate th'impatient throng; White-muslined misses and mammas are seen, Link'd with gay cockneys, glittering o'er the green: The rising breeze unnumber'd charms displays, And the tight ancle strikes th' astonished gaze. But chief, thou Nurse of the Didactic Muse, Divine Nonsensia, all thy soul infuse; The charms of Secants and of Tangents tell, How Loves and Graces in an Angle dwell; How slow progressive Points protract the Line, As pendent spiders spin the filmy twine; How lengthen'd Lines, impetuous sweeping round, Spread the wide Plane, and mark its circling bound; How Planes, their substance with their motion grown, Form the huge Cube, the Cylinder, the Cone. Lo! where the chimney's sooty tube ascends, The fair Trochais from the corner bends! Her coal-black eyes upturn'd, incessant mark The eddying smoke, quick flame, and volant spark; Dart her quick ken, where flashing in between, Her much-loved Smoke-Jack glimmers thro' the scene; Mark how his various parts together tend, Point to one purpose,—in one object end; The spiral grooves in smooth meanders flow, Drags the long chain, the polish'd axles glow, While slowly circumvolves the piece of beef below: The conscious fire with bickering radiance burns, Eyes the rich joint, and roasts it as it turns. So youthful Horner roll'd the roguish eye, Cull'd the dark plum from out his Christmas pie, And cried, in self-applause—“How good a boy am I.” So, the sad victim of domestic spite, Fair Cinderella, pass'd the wintry night, In the lone chimney's darksome nook immured, Her form disfigured, and her charms obscured. Sudden her godmother appears in sight, Lifts the charm'd rod, and chants the mystic rite; The chanted rite the maid attentive hears, And feels new ear-rings deck her listening ears; While 'midst her towering tresses, aptly set, Shines bright, with quivering glance, the smart aigrette; Brocaded silks the splendid dress complete, And the Glass Slipper grasps her fairy feet. Six cock-tail'd mice transport her to the ball, And livery'd lizards wait upon her call. Frere. Alas! that partial Science should approve The sly Rectangle's too licentious love! For three bright nymphs, &amp;c. &amp;c. (To be continued.) (Continued.) April 23, 1798. Alas! that partial Science should approve The sly Rectangle's too licentious love! For three bright nymphs the wily wizard burns;— Three bright-eyed nymphs requite his flame by turns. Strange force of magic skill! combined of yore With Plato's science and Menecmus' lore. In Afric's schools, amid those sultry sands High on its base where Pompey's pillar stands, This learnt the Seer; and learnt, alas! too well, Each scribbled talisman, and smoky spell: What mutter'd charms, what soul-subduing arts, Fell Zatanai to his sons imparts. Gins—black and huge! who in Dom-Daniel's cave Writhe your scorch'd limbs on sulphur's azure-wave Or, shivering, yell amidst eternal snows, Where cloud-capp'd Caf protrudes his granite toes; (Bound by his will, Judæa's fabled king, Lord of Aladdin's lamp and mystic ring.) Gins! ye remember!—for your toil convey'd Whate'er of drugs the powerful charm could aid; Air, earth, and sea ye search'd, and where below Flame embryo lavas, young volcanoes glow,— Gins! ye beheld appall'd th' enchanter's hand Wave in dark, air th' Hypothenusal wand; Saw him the mystic Circle trace, and wheel With head erect, and far-extended heel; Saw him, with speed that mock'd the dazzled eye, Self-whirl'd, in quick gyrations eddying fly: Till done the potent spell—behold him grown Fair Venus' emblem—the Phœnician Cone. Triumphs the Seer, and now secure observes The kindling passions of the rival Curves. And first, the fair Parabola behold, Her timid arms, with virgin blush, unfold! Though, on one focus fix'd, her eyes betray A heart that glows with love's resistless sway, Though, climbing oft, she strive with bolder grace Round his tall neck to clasp her fond embrace, Still ere she reach it, from his polish'd side Her trembling hands in devious Tangents glide. Not thus Hyperbola:—with subtlest art The blue-eyed wanton plays her changeful part; Quick as her conjugated axes move Through every posture of luxurious love, Her sportive limbs with easiest grace expand; Her charms unveil'd provoke the lover's hand: Unveil'd, except in many a filmy ray, Where light Asymptotes o'er her bosom play, Nor touch her glowing skin, nor intercept the day. Yet why, Ellipsis, at thy fate repine? More lasting bliss, securer joys are thine. Though to each fair his treacherous wish may stray, Though each, in turn, may seize a transient sway, 'Tis thine with mild coercion to restrain, Twine round his struggling heart, and bind with endless chain. Ellis. Thus, happy France! in thy regenerate land, Where Taste with Rapine saunters hand in hand; Where, nursed in seats of innocence and bliss, Reform greets Terror with fraternal kiss; Where mild Philosophy first taught to scan The wrongs of Providence, and rights of Man; Where Memory broods o'er Freedom's earlier scene, The Lantern bright, and brighter Guillotine; Three gentle swains evolve their longing arms, And woo the young Republic's virgin charms; And though proud Barras with the fair succeed, Though not in vain th' Attorney Rewbell plead, Oft doth th' impartial nymph their love forego, To clasp thy crooked shoulders, blest Lepaux! So, with dark dirge athwart the blasted heath, T?ree Sister Witches hail'd the appall'd Macbeth. So, the Three Fates beneath grim Pluto's roof, Strain the dun warp, and weave the murky woof; Till deadly Atropos with fatal shears Slits the thin promise of th' expected years, While 'midst the dungeon's gloom or battle's din, Ambition's victims perish, as they spin. Thus, the Three Graces on the Idalian green Bow with deft homage to Cythera's Queen; Her polish'd arms with pearly bracelets deck, Part her light locks, and bare her ivory neck; Round her fair form ethereal odours throw, And teach th' unconscious zephyrs where to blow; Floats the thin gauze, and glittering as they play, The bright folds flutter in phlogistic day. So, with his daughters Three, th' unsceptred Lear Heaved the loud sigh, and pour'd the glistering tear: His daughters Three, save one alone, conspire (Rich in his gifts) to spurn their generous sire; Bid the rude storm his hoary tresses drench, Stint the spare meal, the hundred knights retrench; Mock his mad sorrow, and with alter'd mien Renounce the daughter, and assert the queen. A father's griefs his feeble frame convulse, Rack his white head, and fire his feverous pulse; Till kind Cordelia soothes his soul to rest, And folds the parent-monarch to her breast. Canning, Ellis, and Frere. Thus some fair spinster grieves in wild affright, Vex'd with dull megrim, or vertigo light; Pleased round the fair Three dawdling doctors stand, Wave the white wig, and stretch the asking hand, State the grave doubt, the nauseous draught decree, And all receive, though none deserve, a fee. So down thy hill, romantic Ashbourn, glides The Derby dilly, carrying Three Insides. One in each corner sits, and lolls at ease, With folded arms, propt back, and outstretch'd knees; While the press'd Bodkin, punch'd and squeezed to death, Sweats in the mid-most place, and scolds, and pants for breath. (To be continued.) May 7, 1798 EXTRACT. Twas thine alone, O youth of giant frame, Isosceles! that rebel heart to tame! In vain coy Mathesis thy presence flies: Still turn her fond hallucinating eyes; Thrills with Galvanic fires each tortuous nerve, Throb her blue veins, and dies her cold reserve. —Yet strives the fair, till in the giant's breast She sees the mutual passion flame confess'd: Where'er he moves, she sees his tall limbs trace Internal Angles equal at the base; Again she doubts him: but produced at will, She sees th' external Angles equal still. Say, blest Isosceles! what favouring power, Or love, or chance, at night's auspicious hour, While to the Asses'-Bridge entranced you stray'd, Led to the Asses'-Bridge the enamour'd maid?— The Asses'-Bridge, for ages doom'd to hear The deafening surge assault his wooden ear, With joy repeats sweet sounds of mutual bliss, The soft susurrant sigh, and gently-murmuring kiss. So thy dark arches, London Bridge, bestride Indignant Thames, and part his angry tide, There oft—returning from those green retreats, Where fair Vauxhallia decks her sylvan seats;— Where each spruce nymph, from city compters free, Sips the froth'd syllabub, or fragrant tea; While with sliced ham, scraped beef, and burnt champagne, Her 'prentice lover soothes his amorous pain; There oft, in well-trimm'd wherry, glide along Smart beaux and giggling belles, a glittering throng: Smells the tarr'd rope—with undulation fine Flaps the loose sail—the silken awnings shine; “Shoot we the bridge!” the venturous boatmen cry; “Shoot we the bridge!” the exulting fare reply. —Down the steep fall the headlong waters go, Curls the white foam, the breakers roar below. The veering helm the dexterous steersman stops, Shifts the thin oars, the fluttering canvas drops; Then with closed eyes, clench'd hands, and quick-drawn breath, Darts at the central arch, nor heeds the gulf beneath. —Full 'gainst the pier the unsteady timbers knock, The thin planks, starting, own the impetuous shock; The shifted oar, dropp'd sail, and steadied helm, With angry surge the closing waters whelm— —Laughs the glad Thames, and clasps each fair one's charms, That screams and scrambles in his oozy arms. —Drench'd each thin garb, and clogg'd each struggling limb, Far o'er the stream the Cocknies sink or swim; While each badged boatman, clinging to his oar, Bounds o'er the buoyant wave, and climbs the applauding shore. So, towering Alp! from thy majestic ridge Young Freedom gazed on Lodi's blood-stain'd Bridge; Saw, in thick throngs, conflicting armies rush, Ranks close on ranks, and squadrons squadrons crush; Burst in bright radiance through the battle's storm, Waved her broad hands, display'd her awful form; Bade at her feet regenerate nations bow, And twined the wreath round Buonaparte's brow. —Quick with new lights, fresh hopes, and alter'd zeal, The slaves of despots dropp'd the softened steel: Exulting Victory crown'd her favourite child, And freed Liguria clapp'd her hands, and smiled. Nor long the time ere Britain's shores shall greet The warrior-sage, with gratulation sweet: Eager to grasp the wreath of naval fame, The Great Republic plans the Floating Frame! —O'er the huge frame gigantic Terror stalks, And counts with joy the close-compacted balks: Of young-eyed Massacres the Cherub crew, Round their grim chief the mimic task pursue; Turn the stiff screw, apply the strengthening clamp, Drive the long bolt, or fix the stubborn cramp, Lash the reluctant beam, the cable splice, Join the firm dove-tail with adjustment nice, Through yawning fissures urge the willing wedge, Or give the smoothing adze a sharper edge. —Or group'd in fairy bands, with playful care, The unconscious bullet to the furnace bear, Or gaily tittering, tip the match with fire, Prime the big mortar, bid the shell aspire; Applaud, with tiny hands, and laughing eyes, And watch the bright destruction as it flies. Now the fierce forges gleam with angry glare— The windmill waves his woven wings in air; Swells the proud sail, the exulting streamers fly, Their nimble fins unnumber'd paddles ply: —Ye soft airs breathe, ye gentle billows waft, And, fraught with Freedom, bear the expected Raft! Perch'd on her back, behold the Patriot train, Muir, Ashley, Barlow, Buonaparte, Paine! While Rowan's hand directs the blood-empurpled rein. Ye Imps of Murder! guard her angel form, Check the rude surge, and chase the hovering storm; Shield from contusive rocks her timber limbs, And guide the sweet Enthusiast as she swims; —And now, with web-foot oars, she gains the land, And foreign footsteps press the yielding sand: —The Communes spread, the gay Departments smile, Fair Freedom's Plant o'ershades the laughing isle: Fired with new hopes, the exulting peasant sees The Gallic streamer woo the British breeze; While, pleased to watch its undulating charms, The smiling infant spreads his little arms. Ye Sylphs of Death! on demon pinions flit Where the tall Guillotine is raised for Pitt: To the poised plank tie fast the monster's back, Close the nice slider, ope the expectant sack; Then twitch, with fairy hands, the frolic pin— Down falls the impatient axe with deafening din; The liberated head rolls off below, And simpering Freedom hails the happy blow! Canning, Ellis, and Frere. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF JEAN BON ST. ANDRE. May 14, 1798. I All in the town of Tunis, In Africa the torrid, On a Frenchman of rank Was play'd such a prank, As Lepaux must think quite horrid. II No story half so shocking, By kitchen-fire or laundry, Was ever heard tell,— As that which befel The great Jean Bon St. Andre. III Poor John was a gallant Captain, In battles much delighting; He fled full soon On the first of June— But he bade the rest keep fighting. IV To Paris then returning, And recover'd from his panic, He translated the plan Of “Paine's Rights of Man” Into language Mauritanic. V He went to teach at Tunis— Where as Consul he was settled— Amongst other things, “That the people are kings!” Whereat the Dey was nettled. VI The Moors being rather stupid, And in temper somewhat mulish, Understood not a word Of the doctrine they heard, And thought the Consul foolish. VII He form'd a Club of Brothers, And moved some resolutions— “Ho! ho! (says the Dey), “So this is the way “That the French make Revolutions.” VIII The Dey then gave his orders In Arabic and Persian— “Let no more be said— “But bring me his head!— “These Clubs are my aversion.” IX The Consul quoted Wicquefort, And Puffendorf and Grotius; And proved from Vattel Exceedingly well, Such a deed would be quite atrocious. X 'Twould have moved a Christian's bowels To hear the doubts he stated;— But the Moors they did As they were bid, And strangled him while he prated. XI His head with a sharp-edged sabre They sever'd from his shoulders, And stuck it on high, Where it caught the eye, To the wonder of all beholders. XII This sure is a doleful story As e'er you heard or read of;— If at Tunis you prate Of matters of state, Anon they cut your head off! XIII But we hear the French Directors Have thought the point so knotty; That the Dey having shown He dislikes Jean Bon, They have sent him Bernadotte. Canning, Ellis, and Frere. THE ROVERS; OR, THE DOUBLE ARRANGEMENT. Verse has been extracted from prose drama. PROLOGUE. IN CHARACTER. Too long the triumphs of our early times, With Civil Discord and with Regal crimes, Have stain'd these boards; while Shakespeare's pen has shown Thoughts, manners, men, to modern days unknown. Too long have Rome and Athens been the rage; [Applause. And classic Buskins soil'd a British stage. To-night our bard, who scorns pedantic rules, His plot has borrow'd from the German schools; The German schools—where no dull maxims bind The bold expansion of th' electric mind. Fix'd to no period, circled by no space, He leaps the flaming bounds of time and place: Round the dark confines of the Forest raves, With gentle Robbers stocks his gloomy caves; Tells how bad Ministers are shocking things, And reigning Dukes are just like tyrant Kings; How to two swains one nymph her vows may give, And how two damsels with one lover live! Delicious scenes!—such scenes our bard displays, Which, crown'd with German, sue for British, praise. Slow are the steeds, that through Germania's roads With hempen rein the slumbering post-boy goads; Slow is the slumbering post-boy, who proceeds Through deep sands floundering, on these tardy steeds; More slow, more tedious, from his husky throat Twangs through the twisted horn the struggling note. These truths confess'd—Oh! yet, ye travell'd few, Germania's plays with eyes unjaundiced view! View and approve!—though in each passage fine The faint Translation mock the genuine line, Though the nice ear the erring sight belie, For U twice dotted is pronounced like I; [Applause. Yet oft the scene shall nature's fire impart, Warm from the breast, and glowing to the heart! Ye travell'd few, attend!—On you our bard Builds his fond hope! Do you his genius guard! [Applause. Nor let succeeding generations say A British audience damn'd a German play! [Loud and continued applauses. SONG. BY ROGERO. I Whene'er with haggard eyes I view This dungeon that I'm rotting in, I think of those companions true Who studied with me at the U— —niversity of Gottingen,— —niversity of Gottingen. [Weeps, and pulls out a blue kerchief, with which he wipes his eyes; gazing tenderly at it, he proceeds— II Sweet kerchief, check'd with heavenly blue, Which once my love sat knotting in!— Alas! Matilda then was true! At least I thought so at the U— —niversity of Gottingen— —niversity of Gottingen. [At the repetition of this line Rogero clanks his chains in cadence. III Barbs! barbs! alas! how swift you flew Her neat post-waggon trotting in! Ye bore Matilda from my view; Forlorn I languish'd at the U— —niversity of Gottingen— —niversity of Gottingen. IV This faded form! this pallid hue! This blood my veins is clotting in, My years are many—they were few When first I entered at the U— —niversity of Gottingen— —niversity of Gottingen. V There first for thee my passion grew, Sweet! sweet Matilda Pottingen! Thou wast the daughter of my tu— —tor, law professor at the U— —niversity of Gottingen— —niversity of Gottingen. VI Sun, moon, and thou vain world, adieu, That kings and priests are plotting in: Here doom'd to starve on water gru— —el, never shall I see the U— —niversity of Gottingen— —niversity of Gottingen. [Hist! hist! nor let the airs that blow] RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED. Casimere. Hist! hist! nor let the airs that blow From night's cold lungs our purpose know! Puddingfield. Let Silence, mother of the dumb, Beefington. Press on each lip her palsied thumb! Waiter. Let Privacy, allied to Sin, That loves to haunt the tranquil inn— Grenadier. And Conscience start, when she shall view, Troubadour. The mighty deed we mean to do! GENERAL CHORUS —Con spirito. Then friendship swear, ye faithful bands, Swear to save a shackled hero! See where yon abbey frowning stands! Rescue, rescue, brave Rogero! Casimere. Thrall'd in a monkish tyrant's fetters Shall great Rogero hopeless lie? Young Pot. In my pocket I have letters, Saying, “Help me, or I die!” TRANSLATION OF A LETTER (IN ORIENTAL CHARACTERS) FROM BOBBA-DARA-ADUL-PHOOLA, DRAGOMAN TO THE EXPEDITION, TO NEEK-AWL-ARETCHID-KOOEEZ, SECRETARY TO THE TUNISIAN EMBASSY. Dear Neek-awl, You'll rejoice that at length I am able To date these few lines from the captain's own table. Mr. Truman himself, of his proper suggestion, Has in favour of science decided the question; So we walk the main-deck, and are mess'd with the captain, I leave you to judge of the joy we are wrapt in. At Spithead they embark'd us, how precious a cargo! And we sail'd before day to escape the embargo. There was Shuckborough, the wonderful mathematician; And Darwin, the poet, the sage, and physician; There was Beddoes, and Bruin, and Godwin whose trust is, He may part with his work on Political Justice To some Iman or Bonze, or Judaical Rabbin; So with huge quarto volumes he piles up the cabin. There was great Dr. Parr, whom we style Bellendenus, The Doctor and I have a hammock between us— Tho' 'tis rather unpleasant thus crowding together, On account of the motion and heat of the weather; Two souls in one berth we might easily cram, But Sir John will insist on a place for his ram. Though the Doctor, I find, is determined to think 'Tis the animal's hide that occasions the stink; In spite of th' experienced opinion of Truman, Who contends that the scent is exclusively human. But Beddoes and Darwin engage to repair This slight inconvenience with oxygene air. Whither bound? (you will ask) 'Tis a question, my friend, On which I long doubted; my doubt's at an end. To Arabia the stony, Sabæa the gummy, To the land where each man that you meet is a mummy; To the mouths of the Nile, to the banks of Araxes, To the Red and the Yellow, the White and the Black seas, With telescopes, globes, and a quadrant and sextant, And the works of all authors whose writings are extant; With surveys and plans, topographical maps, Theodolites, watches, spring-guns and steel-traps, Phials, crucibles, air-pumps, electric machinery, And pencils for painting the natives and scenery. In short, we are sent to oppose all we know, To the knowledge and mischievous arts of the foe, Who, though placing in arms a well-grounded reliance, Go to war with a flying artillery of science. The French savans, it seems, recommended this measure, With a view to replenish the national treasure. First, the true Rights of Man they will preach in all places, But chief (when 'tis found) in the Egyptian Oasis: And this doctrine, 'tis hoped, in a very few weeks Will persuade the wild Arabs to murder their Sheiks, And, to aid the Great Nation's beneficent plans, Plunder pyramids, catacombs, towns, caravans, Then enlist under Arcole's gallant commander, Who will conquer the world like his model Iskander. His army each day growing bolder and finer, With the Turcoman tribes he subdues Asia Minor, Beats Paul and his Scythians, his journey pursues 'Cross the Indus, with tribes of Armenians and Jews, And Bucharians, and Affghans, and Persians, and Tartars,— Chokes the wretched Mogul in his grandmother's garters, And will hang him to dry in the Luxembourg hall, 'Midst the plunder of Carthage and spoils of Bengal. Such, we hear, was the plan; but I trust, if we meet 'em, That, savant to savant, our cargo will beat 'em. Our plan of proceeding I'll presently tell;— But soft—I am call'd—I must bid you farewell; To attend on our savans my pen I resign, For, it seems, that they duck them on crossing the Line. Canning, Ellis, and Frere. NEW MORALITY. July 9, 1798. From mental mists to purge a nation's eyes; To animate the weak, unite the wise; To trace the deep infection that pervades The crowded town, and taints the rural shades; To mark how wide extends the mighty waste O'er the fair realms of Science, Learning, Taste; To drive and scatter all the brood of lies, And chase the varying falsehood as it flies; The long arrears of ridicule to pay, To drag reluctant dulness back to-day; Much yet remains.—To you these themes belong, Ye favour'd sons of virtue and of song! Say, is the field too narrow? are the times Barren of folly, and devoid of crimes? Yet, venial vices, in a milder age, Could rouse the warmth of Pope's satiric rage: The doting miser, and the lavish heir, The follies and the foibles of the fair, Sir Job, Sir Balaam, and old Euclio's thrift, And Sappho's diamonds with her dirty shift, Blunt, Charteris, Hopkins—meaner subjects fired The keen-eyed Poet, while the Muse inspired Her ardent child—entwining, as he sate, His laurell'd chaplet with the thorns of hate. But say,—indignant does the Muse retire, Her shrine deserted, and extinct its fire? No pious hand to feed the sacred flame, No raptured soul a poet's charge to claim? Bethink thee, Gifford; when some future age Shall trace the promise of thy playful page;— “The hand which brush'd a swarm of fools away, Should rouse to grasp a more reluctant prey!”— Think then, will pleaded indolence excuse The tame secession of thy languid Muse? Ah! where is now that promise? why so long Sleep the keen shafts of satire and of song? Oh! come, with taste and virtue at thy side, With ardent zeal inflamed, and patriot pride; With keen poetic glance direct the blow, And empty all thy quiver on the foe:— No pause—no rest—till weltering on the ground The poisonous hydra lies, and pierced with many a wound. Thou too!—the nameless Bard,—whose honest zeal For law, for morals, for the public weal, Pours down impetuous on thy country's foes The stream of verse, and many-languaged prose; Thou too!—though oft thy ill-advised dislike, The guiltless head with random censure strike,— Though quaint allusions, vague and undefined, Play faintly round the ear, but mock the mind;— Through the mix'd mass yet truth and learning shine, And manly vigour stamps the nervous line; And patriot rage the generous verse inspires, And wakes and points the desultory fires! Yet more remain unknown:—for who can tell What bashful genius, in some rural cell, As year to year, and day succeeds to day, In joyless leisure wastes his life away? In him the flame of early fancy shone; His genuine worth his old companions own; In childhood and in youth their chief confess'd, His master's pride, his pattern to the rest. Now, far aloof retiring from the strife Of busy talents, and of active life, As from the loop-holes of retreat he views Our stage, verse, pamphlets, politics, and news, He loathes the world,—or, with reflection sad, Concludes it irrecoverably mad; Of taste, of learning, morals, all bereft, No hope, no prospect to redeem it left. Frere. Awake! for shame! or ere thy nobler sense Sink in th' oblivious pool of indolence! Must wit be found alone on falsehood's side, Unknown to truth, to virtue unallied? Arise! nor scorn thy country's just alarms; Wield in her cause thy long-neglected arms: Of lofty satire pour th' indignant strain, Leagued with her friends, and ardent to maintain 'Gainst Learning's, Virtue's, Truth's, Religion's foes, A kingdom's safety, and the world's repose. If Vice appal thee,—if thou view with awe Insults that brave, and crimes that 'scape the law; Yet may the specious bastard brood, which claim A spurious homage under Virtue's name, Sprung from a parent nurse of thousand crimes, The New Philosophy of modern times,— Yet, these may rouse thee!—With unsparing hand, Oh, lash the vile impostures from the land! First, stern Philanthropy:—not she, who dries The orphan's tears, and wipes the widow's eyes; Not she, who, sainted Charity her guide, Of British bounty pours the annual tide:— But French Philanthropy;—whose boundless mind Glows with the general love of all mankind;— Philanthropy,—beneath whose baneful sway Each patriot passion sinks, and dies away. Taught in her school to imbibe thy mawkish strain, Condorcet, filtered through the dregs of Paine, Each pedant prig disowns a Briton's part, And plucks the name of England from his heart. What! shall a name, a word, a sound, control Th' aspiring thought, and cramp th' expansive soul? Shall one half-peopled Island's rocky round A love, that glows for all creation, bound? And social charities contract the plan Framed for thy freedom, universal man! No—through th' extended globe his feelings run As broad and general as th' unbounded sun! No narrow bigot he;—his reason'd view Thy interests, England, ranks with thine, Peru! France at our doors, he sees no danger nigh, But heaves for Turkey's woes th' impartial sigh; A steady patriot of the world alone, The friend of every country—but his own. Next comes a gentler Virtue.—Ah! beware Lest the harsh verse her shrinking softness scare. Visit her not too roughly;—the warm sigh Dwells on her lips; the tear-drop gems her eye. Sweet Sensibility, that dwells enshrined In the fine foldings of the feeling mind; With delicate Mimosa's sense endued, That shrinks instinctive from a hand too rude; Or, like the pimpernel, whose prescient flower, Shuts her soft leaves at evening's chilly hour. Sweet child of sickly Fancy!—her of yore From her loved France Rousseau to exile bore; And, while midst lakes and mountains wild he ran, Full of himself, and shunn'd the haunts of man, Taught her o'er each lone vale and Alpine steep To lisp the stories of his wrongs, and weep; Taught her to cherish still in either eye, Of tender tears a plentiful supply, And pour them in the brooks that babbled by; Taught her to mete by rule her feelings strong, False by degrees, and delicately wrong; For the crush'd beetle first,—the widow'd dove, And all the warbled sorrows of the grove; Next for poor suff'ring guilt; and last of all, For parents, friends, a king and country's fall. Mark her fair votaries, prodigal of grief, With cureless pangs, and woes that mock relief, Droop in soft sorrow o'er a faded flower; O'er a dead jack-ass pour the pearly shower; But hear, unmoved, of Loire's ensanguined flood, Choked up with slain; of Lyons drenched in blood; Of crimes that blot the age, the world, with shame, Foul crimes, but sicklied o'er with Freedom's name; Altars and thrones subverted; social life Trampled to earth,—the husband from the wife, Parent from child, with ruthless fury torn; Of talents, honour, virtue, wit, forlorn In friendless exile,—of the wise and good Staining the daily scaffold with their blood; Of savage cruelties, that scare the mind, The rage of madness with hell's lusts combined,— Of hearts torn reeking from the mangled breast, They hear—and hope that all is for the best. Fond hope! but Justice sanctifies the prayer— Justice! here, Satire, strike! 'twere sin to spare! Not she in British Courts that takes her stand, The dawdling balance dangling in her hand, Adjusting punishments to fraud and vice, With scrupulous quirks, and disquisition nice: But firm, erect, with keen reverted glance, Th' avenging angel of regenerate France, Who visits ancient sins on modern times, And punishes the Pope for Cæsar's crimes. Such is the liberal Justice which presides In these our days, and modern patriots guides; Justice, whose blood-stain'd book one sole decree, One statute fills—“the People shall be Free!” Free by what means?—by folly, madness, guilt, By boundless rapines, blood in oceans spilt; By confiscation, in whose sweeping toils The poor man's pittance with the rich man's spoils, Mix'd in one common mass, are swept away, To glut the short-lived tyrant of the day: By laws, religion, morals, all o'erthrown, —Rouse then, ye sovereign people, claim your own— The licence that enthrals, the truth that blinds, The wealth that starves you, and the power that grinds! —So Justice bids.—'Twas her enlighten'd doom, Louis, thy head devoted to the tomb— 'Twas Justice claim'd, in that accursed hour, The fatal forfeit of too lenient power. Mourn for the Man we may;—but for the King,— Freedom, oh! Freedom's such a charming thing! “Much may be said on both sides.”—Hark! I hear A well-known voice that murmurs in my ear,— The voice of Candour.—Hail! most solemn sage, Thou drivelling virtue of this moral age, Candour, which softens party's headlong rage. Candour,—which spares its foes; nor e'er descends With bigot zeal to combat for its friends. Candour,—which loves in see-saw strain to tell Of acting foolishly, but meaning well; Too nice to praise by wholesale, or to blame, Convinced that all men's motives are the same; And finds, with keen discriminating sight, Black's not so black;—nor white so very white. “Fox, to be sure, was vehement and wrong: “But then, Pitt's words, you'll own, were rather strong. “Great men will have their foibles; 'twas just so “With Fox and Pitt full forty years ago! “So Walpole, Pulteney—factions in all times “Have had their follies, ministers their crimes.” Give me th' avow'd, th' erect, the manly foe, Bold I can meet—perhaps may turn his blow; But of all plagues, good Heav'n, thy wrath can send, Save, save, oh! save me from the Candid Friend! “Barras loves plunder—Merlin takes a bribe,— “What then?—shall Candour these good men proscribe? “No! ere we join the loud-accusing throng, “Prove,—not the facts,—but, that they thought them wrong. “Why hang O'Quigley?—he, misguided man, “In sober thought his country's weal might plan: “And, though his deep-laid Treason sapp'd the throne, “Might act from taste in morals, all his own.” Peace to such Reasoners—let them have their way; Shut their dull eyes against the blaze of day— Priestley's a Saint, and Stone a Patriot still; And La Fayette a Hero, if they will. I love the bold uncompromising mind, Whose principles are fix'd, whose views defined: Who, sick of modern cant, discredits quite All taste in morals, innate sense of right, And Nature's impulse, all uncheck'd by art, And feelings fine, that float about the heart. Content, for good men's guidance, bad men's awe, On moral truth to rest, and Gospel law; Who owns, when Traitors feel th' avenging rod, Just retribution, and the hand of God— Who hears the groans through Olmutz' roofs that ring, Of him who chained and who betray'd his king— Hears unappall'd—though Freedom's zealots preach— Unmoved, unsoften'd by Fitzpatrick's speech. That speech on which the melting Commons hung, “While truths divine came mended from his tongue;” How loving husband clings to duteous wife,— How pure Religion soothes the ills of life,— How Popish ladies trust their pious fears And naughty actions in their chaplain's ears. Half novel and half sermon, on it flow'd; With pious zeal the Opposition glow'd; And as o'er each the soft infection crept, Sigh'd as he whined, and as he whimper'd, wept; E'en Curwen dropt a sentimental tear, And stout St. Andrew yelp'd a softer “Hear!” Parent of crimes and fashions! which in vain Our colder servile spirits would attain, How do we ape thee, France! but, bungling still, Disgrace the pattern by our want of skill. The borrow'd step our awkward gait reveals: As clumsy Courtney mars the verse he steals. How do we ape thee, France!—nor claim alone Thy arts, thy tastes, thy morals, for our own, But to thy worthies render homage due, Their “hair-breadth scapes” with anxious interest view; Statesmen and heroines whom this age adores, Though plainer times would call them rogues and whores. See Louvet, patriot, pamphleteer, and sage, Tempering with amorous fire his virtuous rage. Form'd for all tasks, his various talents see— The luscious novel, the severe decree— Then mark him welt'ring in his nasty sty, Bare his lewd transports to the public eye— Not his the love in silent groves that strays, Quits the rude world, and shuns the vulgar gaze. In Lodoiska's full possession blest, One craving void still aches within his breast— Plunged in the filth and fondness of her arms, Not to himself alone he stints her charms— Clasp'd in each other's foul embrace they lie, But know no joy, unless the world stands by. The fool of vanity, for her alone He lives, loves, writes, and dies but to be known. His widow'd mourner flies to poison's aid, Eager to join her Louvet's parted shade In those bright realms where sainted lovers stray— But harsh emetics tear that hope away. Yet hapless Louvet! where thy bones are laid, The easy nymphs shall consecrate the shade. There, in the laughing morn of genial spring, Unwedded pairs shall tender couplets sing; Eringoes o'er the hallow'd spot shall bloom, And flies of Spain buzz softly round the tomb. Or does severer virtue charm? We choose— Roland the just, with ribands in his shoes— And Roland's spouse, who paints with chaste delight The doubtful conflict of her nuptial night;— Her virgin charms what fierce attacks assail'd, And how the rigid Minister prevail'd. But ah! what verse can paint thy stately mien, Guide of the world, preferment's golden queen, Neckar's fair daughter,—Stael the Epicene! Bright o'er whose flaming cheek and purple nose The bloom of young desire unceasing glows! Fain would the Muse—but ah! she dares no more, A mournful voice from lone Guyana's shore, Sad Quatremer—the bold presumption checks, Forbid to question thy ambiguous sex. Canning. To thee, proud Barras bows—thy charms control Rewbell's brute rage, and Merlin's subtle soul— Raised by thy hands, and fashion'd to thy will, Thy power, thy guiding influence, governs still, Where at the blood-stain'd board assiduous plies, The lame artificer of fraud and lies; He with the mitred head and cloven heel— Doom'd the coarse edge of Rewbell's jests to feel; To stand the playful buffet, and to hear The frequent ink-stand whizzing past his ear; While all the five Directors laugh to see “The limping priest so deft at his new ministry.” Last of th' anointed five behold, and least, The Directorial Lama, Sovereign Priest,— Lepaux:—whom atheists worship;—at whose nod Bow their meek heads—the men without a God. Ere long, perhaps, to this astonish'd isle, Fresh from the shores of subjugated Nile, Shall Buonaparte's victor fleet protect The genuine Theo-philanthropic sect,— The sect of Marat, Mirabeau, Voltaire,— Led by their Pontiff, good La Reveillère. Rejoiced our Clubs shall greet him, and install The holy Hunchback in thy dome, St. Paul! While countless votaries thronging in his train, Wave their red caps, and hymn this jocund strain: “Couriers and Stars, Sedition's evening host, Thou Morning Chronicle and Morning Post, Whether ye make the Rights of Man your theme, Your country libel, and your God blaspheme, Or dirt on private worth and virtue throw, Still blasphemous or blackguard, praise Lepaux. “And ye five other wandering bards, that move In sweet accord of harmony and love, Coleridge and Southey, Lloyd, and Lambe and Co. Tune all your mystic harps to praise Lepaux! Priestley and Wakefield, humble, holy men, Give praises to his name with tongue and pen! “Thelwall, and ye that lecture as ye go, And for your pains get pelted, praise Lepaux! “Praise him each Jacobin, or fool, or knave, And your cropp'd heads in sign of worship wave! “All creeping creatures, venemous and low, Paine, Williams, Godwin, Holcroft, praise Lepáux! Frere. “And thou, Leviathan! on ocean's brim Hugest of living things that sleep and swim; Thou, in whose nose, by Burke's gigantic hand, The hook was fixed to drag thee to the land, With ?, ?, and ? in thy train. And ? wallowing in the yeasty main,— Still as ye snort, and puff, and spout, and blow, In puffing, and in spouting, praise Lepaux!” Britain, beware; nor let th' insidious foe, Of force despairing, aim a deadlier blow; Thy peace, thy strength, with devilish wiles assail, And when her arms are vain, by arts prevail. True, thou art rich, art powerful!—thro' thine Isle Industrious skill, contented labour, smile— Far seas are studded with thy countless sails— What wind but wafts them, and what shore but hails? True, thou art brave—o'er all the busy land In patriot ranks embattled myriads stand! Thy foes behold with impotent amaze, And drop the lifted weapon as they gaze. But what avails to guard each outward part, If subtlest poison, circling at thy heart, Spite of thy courage, of thy pow'r, and wealth, Mine the sound fabric of thy vital health? So thine own oak, by some fair streamlet's side, Waves its broad arms, and spreads its leafy pride, Shades the green earth, and tow'ring to the skies Its conscious strength, the tempest's wrath defies: The fowls of Heaven its ample branches share, To its cool shade the panting herds repair— The limpid current works its noiseless way— The fibres loosen, and the roots decay; Prostrate the mighty ruin lies; and all That shared its shelter, perish in its fall. O thou—lamented Sage—whose prescient scan Laid bare foul Anarchy's gigantic plan, Prompt to incredulous hearers to disclose The guilt of France, and Europe's world of woes— Thou, on whose name far distant times shall gaze, The mighty sea-mark of those troubled days, O large of soul, of genius unconfined, Born to delight, instruct, and mend mankind— Burke! in whose breast a Roman ardour glow'd: Whose copious tongue with Grecian richness flow'd; Well hast thou found (if such thy country's doom) A timely refuge in the sheltering tomb! As, in far realms, beneath the cypress shade, Where eastern kings in pomp of death are laid, The perfumed lamp with unextinguish'd light Flames through the vault, and cheers the gloom of night: So, mighty Burke! in thy sepulchral urn, To Fancy's view, the lamp of Truth shall burn. Thither late times shall turn their reverent eyes, Led by thy light, and by thy wisdom wise. There are, to whom (their taste such pleasures cloy) No light thy wisdom yields, thy wit no joy. Peace to their heavy heads, and callous hearts, Peace—such as sloth, as ignorance imparts! Pleased may they live to plan their country's good, And crop with calm content their flow'ry food! What though thy venturous spirit loved to urge The labouring theme to Reason's utmost verge, Kindling and mounting from th' enraptur'd sight; Still anxious wonder watch'd thy daring flight! While vulgar souls, with mean malignant stare, Gazed up, the triumph of thy fall to share! Poor triumph! which for oft extorted praise, To Envy still too daring Genius pays. Oh! for thy playful smile, thy potent frown, T' abash bold Vice, and laugh pert Folly down! So should the Muse in Humour's happiest vein, Frame with light verse the metaphoric strain, With apt allusions from the rural trade, Tell of what wood young Jacobins are made; How the skill'd gardener grafts with nicest rule The slip of coxcomb on the stock of fool— Forth in bright blossom bursts the tender sprig, A thing to wonder at, perhaps a Whig: Should tell, how wise each new-fledged pedant prates Of weightiest matters, grave distractions states— How rules of policy, and public good, In Saxon times were rightly understood; That kings are proper, may be useful things, But then, some gentlemen object to kings; How in all times the minister's to blame; How British liberty's an empty name; Till each fair burgh, numerically free, Shall choose its members by the Rule of Three. So should the Muse, with verse in thunder clothed, Proclaim the crimes by God and Nature loathed. Which—when fell poison revels in the veins— The poison fell, that frantic Gallia drains From the curst fruit of Freedom's blasted tree— Blot the fair records of Humanity. To feebler nations let proud France afford Her damning choice,—the chalice or the sword, To drink or die;—Oh fraud! Oh specious lie! Delusive choice! for if they drink, they die. The sword we dread not:—of ourselves secure, Firm were our strength, our peace and freedom sure. Let all the world confederate all its powers, “Be they not back'd by those that should be ours,” High on his rock shall Britain's Genius stand, Scatter the crowded hosts, and vindicate the land. Guard we but our own hearts: with constant view To ancient morals, ancient manners true, Guard we the manlier virtues, such as nerved Our fathers' breasts, and this proud Isle preserv'd For many a rugged age—and scorn the while, (Her arms we fear not), Gallia's specious wiles, The soft seductions, the refinements nice, Of gay morality, and easy vice— So shall we brave the storm—our 'stablish'd pow'r Thy refuge, Europe, in some happier hour. But French in heart—though victory crown our brow, Low at our feet though prostrate nations bow, Wealth gild our cities, commerce crowd our shore, London may shine, but England is no more. Canning. PROSPECTUS AND SPECIMEN OF AN INTENDED Rational Work, BY WILLIAM AND ROBERT WHISTLECRAFT, OF STOW-MARKET, IN SUFFOLK, HARNESS AND COLLAR-MAKERS, INTENDED TO COMPRISE THE MOST INTERESTING PARTICULARS RELATING TO King Arthur and his Round Table. I Ive often wish'd that I could write a book, Such as all English people might peruse; I never should regret the pains it took, That's just the sort of fame that I should choose: To sail about the world like Captain Cook, I'd sling a cot up for my favourite Muse, And we'd take verses out to Demerara, To New South Wales, and up to Niagara. II Poets consume exciseable commodities, They raise the nation's spirit when victorious, They drive an export trade in whims and oddities, Making our commerce and revenue glorious; As an industrious and pains-taking body 'tis That Poets should be reckon'd meritorious: And therefore I submissively propose To erect one Board for Verse and one for Prose. III Princes protecting Sciences and Art I've often seen, in copper-plate and print; I never saw them elsewhere, for my part, And therefore I conclude there's nothing in't; But everybody knows the Regent's heart; I trust he won't reject a well-meant hint; Each Board to have twelve members, with a seat To bring them in per ann. five-hundred neat:— IV From Princes I descend to the Nobility: In former times all persons of high stations, Lords, Baronets, and Persons of gentility, Paid twenty guineas for the dedications: This practice was attended with utility; The patrons lived to future generations, The poets lived by their industrious earning,— So men alive and dead could live by Learning. V Then, twenty guineas was a little fortune; Now, we must starve unless the times should mend: Our poets now-a-days are deem'd importune If their addresses are diffusely penn'd; Most fashionable authors make a short one To their own wife, or child, or private friend, To show their independence, I suppose; And that may do for Gentlemen like those. VI Lastly, the common people I beseech— Dear People! if you think my verses clever, Preserve with care your noble Parts of speech, And take it as a maxim to endeavour To talk as your good mothers used to teach, And then these lines of mine may last for ever; And don't confound the language of the nation With long-tail'd words in osity and ation. VII I think that Poets (whether Whig or Tory) (Whether they go to meeting or to church) Should study to promote their country's glory With patriotic, diligent research; That children yet unborn may learn the story, With grammars, dictionaries, canes, and birch: It stands to reason—This was Homer's plan, And we must do—like him—the best we can. VIII Madoc and Marmion, and many more, Are out in print, and most of them have sold; Perhaps together they may make a score; Richard the First has had his story told, But there were Lords and Princes long before, That had behaved themselves like warriors bold; Among the rest there was the great King Arthur, What hero's fame was ever carried farther? IX King Arthur, and the Knights of his Round Table, Were reckon'd the best King, and bravest Lords, Of all that flourish'd since the Tower of Babel, At least of all that history records; Therefore I shall endeavour, if I'm able, To paint their famous actions by my words: Heroes exert themselves in hopes of Fame, And having such a strong decisive claim, X It grieves me much, that Names that were respected In former ages, Persons of such mark, And Countrymen of ours, should lie neglected, Just like old portraits lumbering in the dark: An error such as this should be corrected, And if my Muse can strike a single spark, Why then (as poets say) I'll string my lyre; And then I'll light a great poetic Fire; XI I'll air them all, and rub down the Round Table, And wash the Canvas clean, and scour the Frames, And put a coat of varnish on the Fable, And try to puzzle out the Dates and Names; Then (as I said before) I'll heave my cable, And take a pilot, and drop down the Thames— —These first eleven stanzas make a Proem, And now I must sit down and write my Poem. CANTO I. I Beginning (as my Bookseller desires) Like an old Minstrel with his gown and beard, “Fair Ladies, gallant Knights, and gentle Squires, “Now the last service from the Board is clear'd, “And if this noble Company requires, “And if amidst your mirth I may be heard, “Of sundry strange adventures I could tell, “That oft were told before, but never told so well.” II The Great King Arthur made a sumptuous Feast, And held his Royal Christmas at Carrisle, And thither came the Vassals, most and least, From every corner of this British Isle; And all were entertain'd, both man and beast, According to their rank, in proper style; The steeds were fed and litter'd in the stable, The ladies and the knights sat down to table. III The bill of fare (as you may well suppose) Was suited to those plentiful old times, Before our modern luxuries arose, With truffles and ragoûts, and various crimes; And therefore, from the original in prose I shall arrange the catalogue in rhymes: They served up salmon, venison, and wild boars By hundreds, and by dozens, and by scores. IV Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard, Muttons, and fatted beeves, and bacon swine; Herons and bitterns, peacock, swan and bustard, Teal, mallard, pigeons, widgeons, and in fine Plum-puddings, pancakes, apple-pies and custard: And therewithal they drank good Gascon wine, With mead, and ale, and cider of our own; For porter, punch, and negus, were not known. V The noise and uproar of the scullery tribe, All pilfering and scrambling in their calling, Was past all powers of language to describe— The din of manful oaths and female squalling: The sturdy porter, huddling up his bribe, And then at random breaking heads and bawling, Outcries, and cries of order, and contusions, Made a confusion beyond all confusions; VI Beggars and vagabonds, blind, lame, and sturdy, Minstrels and singers with their various airs, The pipe, the tabor, and the hurdy-gurdy, Jugglers and mountebanks with apes and bears, Continued from the first day to the third day, An uproar like ten thousand Smithfield fairs; There were wild beasts and foreign birds and creatures, And Jews and Foreigners with foreign features. VII All sorts of people there were seen together, All sorts of characters, all sorts of dresses; The fool with fox's tail and peacock's feather, Pilgrims, and penitents, and grave burgesses; The country people with their coats of leather, Vintners and victuallers with cans and messes; Grooms, archers, varlets, falconers and yeomen, Damsels and waiting-maids, and waiting-women. VIII But the profane, indelicate amours, The vulgar, unenlighten'd conversation Of minstrels, menials, courtezans, and boors, (Although appropriate to their meaner station) Would certainly revolt a taste like yours; Therefore I shall omit the calculation Of all the curses, oaths, and cuts and stabs, Occasion'd by their dice, and drink, and drabs. IX We must take care in our poetic cruise, And never hold a single tack too long; Therefore my versatile ingenious Muse Takes leave of this illiterate, low-bred throng, Intending to present superior views, Which to genteeler company belong, And show the higher orders of society Behaving with politeness and propriety. X And certainly they say, for fine behaving King Arthur's Court has never had its match; True point of honour, without pride or braving, Strict etiquette for ever on the watch: Their manners were refined and perfect—saving Some modern graces, which they could not catch, As spitting through the teeth, and driving stages, Accomplishments reserved for distant ages. XI They look'd a manly, generous generation; Beards, shoulders, eyebrows, broad, and square, and thick, Their accents firm and loud in conversation, Their eyes and gestures eager, sharp, and quick, Shew'd them prepared, on proper provocation, To give the lie, pull noses, stab and kick; And for that very reason, it is said, They were so very courteous and well-bred. XII The ladies look'd of an heroic race— At first a general likeness struck your eye, Tall figures, open features, oval face, Large eyes, with ample eyebrows arch'd and high; Their manners had an odd, peculiar grace, Neither repulsive, affable, nor shy, Majestical, reserved, and somewhat sullen; Their dresses partly silk, and partly woollen. XIII In form and figure far above the rest, Sir Launcelot was chief of all the train, In Arthur's Court an ever welcome guest; Britain will never see his like again. Of all the Knights she ever had the best, Except, perhaps, Lord Wellington in Spain: I never saw his picture nor his print, From Morgan's Chronicle I take my hint. XIV For Morgan says (at least as I have heard, And as a learned friend of mine assures), Beside him all that lordly train appear'd Like courtly minions, or like common boors, As if unfit for knightly deeds, and rear'd To rustic labours or to loose amours; He moved amidst his peers without compare, So lofty was his stature, look, and air. XV Yet oftentimes his courteous cheer forsook His countenance, and then return'd again, As if some secret recollection shook His inward heart with unacknowledged pain; And something haggard in his eyes and look (More than his years or hardships could explain) Made him appear, in person and in mind, Less perfect than what nature had design'd. XVI Of noble presence, but of different mien, Alert and lively, voluble and gay, Sir Tristram at Carlisle was rarely seen, But ever was regretted while away; With easy mirth, an enemy to spleen, His ready converse charm'd the wintry day; No tales he told of sieges or of fights, Of foreign marvels, like the foolish Knights, XVII But with a playful imitative tone (That merely seem'd a voucher for the truth) Recounted strange adventures of his own, The chances of his childhood and his youth, Of churlish Giants he had seen and known, Their rustic phrase and courtesies uncouth, The dwellings, and the diet, and the lives Of savage Monarchs and their monstrous Wives: XVIII Songs, music, languages, and many a lay Asturian or Armoric, Irish, Basque, His ready memory seized and bore away; And ever when the Ladies chose to ask, Sir Tristram was prepared to sing and play, Not like a minstrel earnest at his task, But with a sportive, careless, easy style, As if he seem'd to mock himself the while. XIX His ready wit and rambling education, With the congenial influence of his stars, Had taught him all the arts of conversation, All games of skill and stratagems of wars; His birth, it seems, by Merlin's calculation, Was under Venus, Mercury, and Mars; His mind with all their attributes was mixt, And, like those planets, wandering and unfixt; XX From realm to realm he ran—and never staid; Kingdoms and crowns he wan—and gave away: It seem'd as if his labours were repaid By the mere noise and movement of the fray: No conquests nor acquirements had he made: His chief delight was on some festive day To ride triumphant, prodigal, and proud, And shower his wealth amidst the shouting crowd: XXI His schemes of war were sudden, unforeseen, Inexplicable both to friend and foe; It seem'd as if some momentary spleen Inspired the project and impell'd the blow; And most his fortune and success were seen With means the most inadequate and low; Most master of himself, and least encumber'd, When overmatch'd, entangled, and outnumber'd. XXII Strange instruments and engines he contrived For sieges, and constructions for defence, Inventions some of them that have survived, Others were deem'd too cumbrous and immense: Minstrels he loved, and cherish'd while he lived, And patronized them both with praise and pence; Somewhat more learned than became a Knight, It was reported he could read and write. XXIII Sir Gawain may be painted in a word— He was a perfect loyal Cavalier; His courteous manners stand upon record, A stranger to the very thought of fear. The proverb says, As brave as his own sword; And like his weapon was that worthy Peer, Of admirable temper, clear and bright, Polish'd yet keen, though pliant yet upright. XXIV On every point, in earnest or in jest, His judgment, and his prudence, and his wit, Were deem'd the very touchstone and the test Of what was proper, graceful, just, and fit; A word from him set every thing at rest, His short decisions never fail'd to hit; His silence, his reserve, his inattention, Were felt as the severest reprehension: XXV His memory was the magazine and hoard, Where claims and grievances, from year to year, And confidences and complaints were stored, From dame and knight, from damsel, boor, and peer: Loved by his friends, and trusted by his Lord, A generous courtier, secret and sincere, Adviser-general to the whole community, He served his friend, but watch'd his opportunity. XXVI One riddle I could never understand— But his success in war was strangely various; In executing schemes that others plann'd, He seem'd a very Cæsar or a Marius; Take his own plans, and place him in command, Your prospect of success became precarious: His plans were good, but Launcelot succeeded And realized them better far than He did. XXVII His discipline was stedfast and austere, Unalterably fix'd, but calm and kind; Founded on admiration, more than fear, It seem'd an emanation from his mind; The coarsest natures that approach'd him near Grew courteous for the moment and refined; Beneath his eye the poorest, weakest wight Felt full of point-of-honour like a knight. XXVIII In battle he was fearless to a fault, The foremost in the thickest of the field; His eager valour knew no pause nor halt, And the red rampant Lion in his Shield Scaled Towns and Towers, the foremost in assault, With ready succour where the battle reel'd: At random like a thunderbolt he ran, And bore down shields, and pikes, and horse, and man. CANTO II. I I've finish'd now three hundred lines and more, And therefore I begin Canto the Second, Just like those wandering ancient Bards of Yore; They never laid a plan, nor ever reckon'd What turning they should take the day before; They follow'd where the lovely Muses beckon'd: The Muses led them up to Mount Parnassus, And that's the reason that they all surpass us. II The Muses served those Heathens well enough— Bold Britons take a Tankard, or a Bottle, And when the bottle's out, a pinch of snuff, And so proceed in spite of Aristotle— Those Rules of his are dry, dogmatic stuff, All life and fire they suffocate and throttle— And therefore I adopt the mode I mention, Trusting to native judgment and invention. III This method will, I hope, appear defensible— I shall begin by mentioning the Giants, A race of mortals, brutal and insensible, (Postponing the details of the Defiance, Which came in terms so very reprehensible From that barbarian sovereign King Ryence) Displaying simpler manners, forms, and passions, Unmix'd by transitory modes and fashions. IV Before the Feast was ended, a Report Fill'd every soul with horror and dismay; Some Ladies, on their journey to the Court, Had been surprised, and were convey'd away By the Aboriginal Giants, to their Fort— An unknown Fort—for Government, they say, Had ascertain'd its actual existence, But knew not its direction, nor its distance. V A waiting damsel, crooked and mis-shaped, Herself the witness of a woful scene, From which, by miracle, she had escaped, Appear'd before the Ladies and the Queen; Her figure was funereal, veil'd and craped, Her voice convulsed with sobs and sighs between, That with the sad recital, and the sight, Revenge and rage inflamed each worthy knight. VI Sir Gawain rose without delay or dallying, “Excuse us, madam,—we've no time to waste—” And at the palace-gate you saw him sallying, With other knights, equipp'd and arm'd in haste; And there was Tristram making jests, and rallying The poor mis-shapen Damsel, whom he placed Behind him on a pillion, pad, or pannel; He took, besides, his falcon and his spaniel. VII But what with horror, and fatigue, and fright, Poor soul, she could not recollect the way. They reach'd the mountains on the second night, And wander'd up and down till break of day, When they discover'd, by the dawning light, A lonely glen, where heaps of embers lay; They found unleaven'd fragments, scorch'd and toasted, And the remains of mules and horses roasted. VIII Sir Tristram understood the Giants' courses— He felt the embers, but the heat was out— He stood contemplating the roasted horses, And all at once, without suspense or doubt, His own decided judgment thus enforces— “The Giants must be somewhere here about!” Demonstrating the carcasses, he shows That they remain'd untouch'd by kites or crows; IX “You see no traces of their sleeping here, “No heap of leaves or heath, no Giant's nest— “Their usual habitation must be near— “They feed at sunset and retire to rest— “A moment's search will set the matter clear.” The fact turn'd out precisely as he guess'd; And shortly after, scrambling through a gully, He verified his own conjecture fully. X He found a Valley, closed on every side, Resembling that which Rasselas describes; Six miles in length, and half as many wide, Where the descendants of the Giant tribes Lived in their ancient Fortress undescried: (Invaders tread upon each other's kibes) First came the Britons, afterwards the Roman, Our patrimonial lands belong to no man: XI So Horace said—and so the Giants found, Expelled by fresh invaders in succession; But they maintained tenaciously the ground Of ancient, indefeasible possession, And robb'd and ransack'd all the country round; And ventured on this horrible transgression, Claiming a right reserved to waste and spoil, As Lords and lawful owners of the soil. XII Huge mountains of immeasurable height Encompass'd all the level Valley round, With mighty slabs of rock, that sloped upright, An insurmountable, enormous mound; The very River vanish'd out of sight, Absorb'd in secret channels under ground: That Vale was so sequester'd and secluded, All search for ages past it had eluded. XIII High overhead was many a Cave and Den, That with its strange construction seem'd to mock All thought of how they were contrived, or when— —Hewn inward in the huge suspended Rock, The Tombs and Monuments of mighty men: Such were the patriarchs of this ancient stock. Alas! what pity that the present race Should be so barbarous, and depraved, and base! XIV For they subsisted (as I said) by pillage, And the wild beasts which they pursued and chased: Nor house, nor herdsman's hut, nor farm, nor village, Within the lonely valley could be traced, Nor roads, nor bounded fields, nor rural tillage, But all was lonely, desolate, and waste. The Castle which commanded the domain Was suited to so rude and wild a Reign: XV A Rock was in the centre, like a Cone, Abruptly rising from a miry pool, Where they beheld a Pile of massy stone, Which masons of the rude primeval school Had rear'd by help of Giant hands alone, With rocky fragments unreduc'd by rule, Irregular, like Nature more than Art, Huge, rugged, and compact in every part. XVI But on the other side a River went, And there the craggy Rock and ancient Wall Had crumbled down with shelving deep descent; Time and the wearing stream had work'd its fall: The modern Giants had repair'd the Rent, But poor, reduced, and ignorant withal, They patch'd it up, contriving as they could, With stones, and earth, and palisades of wood; XVII Sir Gawain tried a parley, but in vain— A true bred Giant never trusts a Knight— He sent a Herald, who return'd again All torn to rags and perishing with fright; A Trumpeter was sent, but he was slain— To Trumpeters they bear a mortal spite: When all conciliatory measures fail'd, The Castle and the Fortress were assail'd. XVIII But when the Giants saw them fairly under, They shovell'd down a cataract of stones, A hideous volley like a peal of thunder, Bouncing and bounding down, and breaking bones, Rending the earth, and riving rocks asunder; Sir Gawain inwardly laments and groans, Retiring last, and standing most exposed;— Success seem'd hopeless, and the combat closed. XIX A Council then was call'd, and all agreed To call in succour from the Country round; By regular approaches to proceed, Intrenching, fortifying, breaking ground. That morning Tristram happen'd to secede: It seems his Falcon was not to be found; He went in search of her, but some suspected He went lest his advice should be neglected. XX At Gawain's summons all the Country came; At Gawain's summons all the people aided; They called upon each other in his name, And bid their neighbours work as hard as they did. So well beloved was He, for very shame They dug, they delved, entrench'd, and palisaded, Till all the Fort was thoroughly blockaded, And every Ford where Giants might have waded. XXI Sir Tristram found his Falcon, bruised and lame, After a tedious search, as he averr'd, And was returning back the way he came When in the neighbouring thicket something stirr'd, And flash'd across the path, as bright as flame, Sir Tristram follow'd it, and found a Bird Much like a Pheasant, only crimson-red, With a fine tuft of feathers on his head. XXII Sir Tristram's mind—invention—powers of thought, Were occupied, abstracted, and engaged, Devising ways and means to have it caught Alive—entire—to see it safely caged: The Giants and their siege he set at nought Compar'd with this new warfare that he waged. He gain'd his object after three days wandering, And three nights watching, meditating, pondering, XXIII And to the Camp in triumph he return'd: He makes them all admire the creature's crest, And praise and magnify the prize he earn'd. Sir Gawain rarely ventured on a jest, But here his heart with indignation burn'd: “Good Cousin, yonder stands an Eagle's nest! —“A Prize for Fowlers such as you and me.”— Sir Tristram answer'd mildly, “We shall see.” XXIV Good humour was Sir Tristram's leading quality, And in the present case he proved it such; If he forbore, it was that in reality His conscience smote him with a secret touch, For having shock'd his worthy friend's formality— He thought Sir Gawain had not said too much; He walks apart with him—and he discourses About their preparation and their forces— XXV Approving every thing that had been done— “It serves to put the Giants off their guard— “Less hazard and less danger will be run— “I doubt not we shall find them unprepared— “The Castle will more easily be won, “And many valuable lives be spared; “The Ladies else, while we blockade and threaten, “Will most infallibly be kill'd and eaten.” XXVI Sir Tristram talk'd incomparably well; His reasons were irrefragably strong. As Tristram spoke Sir Gawain's spirits fell, For he discover'd clearly before long (What Tristram never would presume to tell), That his whole system was entirely wrong; In fact his confidence had much diminish'd Since all the preparations had been finish'd. XXVII “Indeed!” Sir Tristram said, “for aught we know— “For aught that we can tell—this very night The valley's entrance may be closed with snow, “And we may starve and perish here outright— “'Tis better risking a decided blow— “I own this weather puts me in a fright.” In fine, this tedious conference to shorten, Sir Gawain trusted to Sir Tristram's fortune. XXVIII 'Twas twilight, ere the wintry dawn had kist With cold salute the mountain's chilly brow; The level lawns were dark, a lake of mist Inundated the vales and depths below, When valiant Tristram, with a chosen list Of bold and hardy men, prepared to go, Ascending through the vapours dim and hoar, A secret track, which he descried before. XXIX If ever you attempted, when a boy, To walk across the play-ground or the yard Blindfolded, for an apple or a toy, Which, when you reach'd the spot, was your reward, You may conceive the difficult employ Sir Tristram had, and that he found it hard, Deprived of landmarks and the power of sight, To steer their dark and doubtful course aright. XXX They climb'd an hour or more with hand and knee; (The distance of a fathom or a rood Was farther than the keenest eye could see;) At last the very ground on which they stood, The broken turf, and many a batter'd tree— The crush'd and shatter'd shrubs and underwood— Apprised them that they were arrived once more Where they were overwhelm'd the time before. XXXI Sir Tristram saw the people in a fluster; He took them to a shelter'd hollow place: They crowded round like chickens in a cluster, And Tristram, with an unembarrass'd face, Proceeded quietly to take a muster, To take a muster, and to state the case— “It was,” he said, “an unexpected error, “Enough to strike inferior minds with terror; XXXII “But since they were assembled and collected,” (All were assembled except nine or ten) “He thought that their design might be effected; “All things were easy to determined men. “If they would take the track which he directed, “And try their old adventure once again,” He slapp'd his breast, and swore within an hour That they should have the Castle in their power. XXXIII This mountain was like others I have seen; There was a stratum or a ridge of stone Projecting high beyond the sloping green, From top to bottom, like a spinal bone, Or flight of steps, with gaps and breaks between— A Copper-plate would make my meaning known Better than words, and therefore with permission, I'll give a Print of it the next Edition. XXXIV Thither Sir Tristram with his comrades went, For now the misty cloud was clear'd away, And they must risk the perilous ascent, Right in the Giants' front, in open day: They ran to reach the shelter which it lent, Before the battery should begin to play. Their manner of ascending up that ridge Was much like climbing by a broken bridge; XXXV For there you scramble on from pier to pier, Always afraid to lose your hold half way; And as they clamber'd each successive tier Of rugged upright rocks, I dare to say, It was not altogether without fear— Just fear enough to make brave people gay: According to the words of Mr. Gray, “They wound with toilsome march their long array.” XXXVI The more alert and active upward sprung, And let down ropes to drag their comrades after; Those ropes were their own shirts together strung, Stript off and twisted with such mirth and laughter, That with their jokes the rocky echoes rung: Like countrymen that on a beam or rafter Attempt to pass a raging wintry flood, Such was the situation where they stood: XXXVII A wild tumultuous torrent raged around, Of fragments tumbling from the mountain's height; The whirling clouds of dust, the deafening sound, The hurried motion that amazed the sight, The constant quaking of the solid ground, Environ'd them with phantoms of affright; Yet with heroic hearts they held right on, Till the last point of their ascent was won. XXXVIII The Giants saw them on the topmost crown Of the last rock, and threaten'd and defied— “Down with the mangy dwarfs there!—Dash them down “Down with the dirty pismires!”—Thus they cried. Sir Tristram, with a sharp sarcastic frown, In their own Giant jargon thus replied, “Mullinger!—Cacamole!—and Mangonell! “You cursed cannibals—I know you well— XXXIX “I'll see that pate of yours upon a post, “And your left-handed squinting brother's too— “By Heaven and Earth, within an hour at most, “I'll give the crows a meal of him and you— “The wolves shall have you—either raw or roast— “I'll make an end of all your cursed crew.” These words he partly said, and partly sang, As usual with the Giants, in their slang. XL He darted forward to the mountain's brow— The Giants ran away—they knew not why— Sir Tristram gain'd the point—he knew not how— He could account for it no more than I. Such strange effects we witness often now; Such strange experiments true Britons try In sieges, and in skirmishes afloat, In storming heights, and boarding from a boat. XLI True Courage bears about a Charm or Spell— It looks, I think, like an instinctive Law By which superior natures daunt and quell Frenchmen and foreigners with fear and awe. I wonder if Philosophers can tell— Can they explain the thing with all their jaw? I can't explain it—but the fact is so, A fact which every midshipman must know. XLII Then instantly the signal was held out, To shew Sir Gawain that the coast was clear: They heard his Camp re-echo with a shout— In half an hour Sir Gawain will be here. But still Sir Tristram was perplext with doubt— The crisis of the Ladies' fate drew near— He dreaded what those poor defenceless creatures Might suffer from such fierce and desperate natures. XLIII The Giants, with their brutal want of sense, In hurling stones to crush them with the fall, And in their hurry taking them from thence, Had half dismantled all the new-built Wall. They left it here and there, a naked fence Of stakes and palisades, upright and tall. Sir Tristram form'd a sudden resolution, And recommended it for execution. XLIV “My Lads,” he cried, “an effort must be made “To keep those Monsters half an hour in play, “While Gawain is advancing to our aid, “Or else the Ladies will be made away. “By mounting close within the palisade, “You'll parry their two-handed, dangerous sway “Their Clubs and Maces: recollect my words, “And use your daggers rather than your swords.” XLV That service was most gallantly perform'd: The Giants still endeavour'd to repel And drive them from the breach that they had storm'd: The foremost of the Crew was Mangonell. At sight of him Sir Tristram's spirit warm'd; With aim unerring Tristram's falchion fell, Lopt off his Club and fingers at the knuckle, And thus disabled that stupendous Chuckle. XLVI The Giant ran, outrageous with the wound, Roaring and bleeding, to the palisade; Sir Tristram swerved aside, and reaching round, Probed all his entrails with his poniard's blade: His Giant limbs fall thundering on the ground, His goggling eyes eternal slumbers shade; Then by the head or heels, I know not which, They dragg'd him forth, and tost him in the Ditch. XLVII Sir Tristram, in the warfare that he waged, Strove to attract the Giant's whole attention; To keep it undivided and engaged, He rack'd his fiery brain and his invention; And taunted and reviled, and storm'd, and raged, In terms far worse, and more than I can mention. In the mean while, in a more sober manner, Sir Gawain was advancing with his banner. XLVIII But first I must commemorate in rhyme Sir Tristram's dextrous swordmanship and might, (This incident appears to me sublime), He struck a Giant's head off in the fight: The head fell down of course, but for some time The stupid, headless trunk remain'd upright; For more than twenty seconds there it stood, But ultimately fell from loss of blood. XLIX Behold Sir Gawain with his valiant band; He enters on the work with warmth and haste, And slays a brace of Giants out of hand, Sliced downward from the shoulder to the waist. But our ichnography must now be plann'd, The Keep or Inner Castle must be traced. I wish myself at the concluding distich, Although I think the thing characteristic. L Facing your Entrance, just three yards behind, There was a Mass of Stone of moderate height, It stood before you like a screen or blind: And there—on either hand to left and right— Were sloping Parapets or Planes inclined, On which two massy Stones were placed upright, Secured by Staples and by leathern Ropes, Which hinder'd them from sliding down the slopes. LI “—Cousin, those Dogs have some device or gin!— “—I'll run the gauntlet—and I'll stand a knock—” He dash'd into the Gate through thick and thin— He hew'd away the bands which held the block— It rush'd along the slope with rumbling din, And closed the entrance with a thundering shock, (Just like those famous old Symplegades Discover'd by the Classics in their seas.) LII This was Sir Tristram—(as you may suppose) He found some Giants wounded, others dead— He shortly equalizes these with those; But one poor Devil there was sick in bed, In whose behalf the Ladies interpose; Sir Tristram spared his life, because they said That he was more humane, and mild, and clever, And all the time had had an ague-fever. LIII The Ladies?—They were tolerably well, At least as well as could have been expected: Many details I must forbear to tell, Their toilet had been very much neglected; But by supreme good luck it so befell That when the Castle's capture was effected, When those vile cannibals were overpower'd, Only two fat Duennas were devour'd. LIV Sir Tristram having thus secured the Fort, And seen all safe, was climbing to the Wall, (Meaning to leap into the outer Court;) But when he came, he saved himself the fall, Sir Gawain had been spoiling all the sport, The Giants were demolish'd one and all: He pull'd them up the Wall—they climb and enter— Such was the winding up of this adventure. LV The only real sufferer in the fight Was a poor neighbouring Squire of little fame, That came and join'd the party overnight; He hobbled home, disabled with a maim Which he received in tumbling from a height: The Knights from Court had never heard his name, Nor recollected seeing him before— Two leopards' faces were the arms he bore. LVI Thus Tristram, without loss of life or limb, Conquer'd the Giants' Castle in a day; But whether it were accident or whim That kept him in the Woods so long away, In any other mortal except him I should not feel a doubt of what to say; But he was wholly guided by his humour, Indifferent to report and public rumour. LVII It was besides imagined and suspected That he had miss'd his course by deep design, To take the track which Gawain had neglected— I speak of others' notions, not of mine: I question even if he recollected— He might have felt a moment's wish to shine; I only know that he made nothing of it, Either for reputation or for profit. LVIII The Ladies, by Sir Gawain's kind direction, Proceeded instantaneously to Court, To thank their Majesties for their protection. Sir Gawain follow'd with a grand escort, And was received with favour and affection. Sir Tristram remain'd loitering in the Fort; He thought the building and the scenery striking, And that poor captive Giant took his liking. LIX And now the thread of our Romance unravels, Presenting new performers on the stage; A Giant's education and his travels Will occupy the next succeeding page: But I begin to tremble at the cavils Of this fastidious, supercilious age; Reviews, and paragraphs in morning papers— The prospect of them gives my Muse the vapours. LX “My dear,” says she, “I think it will be well “To ascertain our losses or our gains: “If this first sample should succeed and sell, “We can renew the same melodious strains.” Poor soul! she's had, I think, a tedious spell, And ought to be consider'd for her pains. And keeping of my company so long— A moderate compliment would not be wrong. CANTO III. I I've a proposal here from Mr. Murray, ‘He offers handsomely—the money down; ‘My dear, you might recover from your flurry ‘In a nice airy lodging out of town, ‘At Croydon, Epsom, anywhere in Surrey; ‘If every stanza brings us in a crown, ‘I think that I might venture to bespeak ‘A bed-room and front-parlour for next week. II ‘Tell me, my dear Thalia, what you think; ‘Your nerves have undergone a sudden shock; ‘Your poor dear spirits have begun to sink; ‘On Banstead Downs you'd muster a new stock, ‘And I'd be sure to keep away from drink, ‘And always go to bed by twelve o'clock. ‘We'll travel down there in the morning stages; ‘Our verses shall go down to distant ages. III ‘And here in town we'll breakfast on hot rolls, ‘And you shall have a better shawl to wear; ‘These pantaloons of mine are chafed in holes; ‘By Monday next I'll compass a new pair: ‘Come, now, fling up the cinders, fetch the coals, ‘And take away the things you hung to air, ‘Set out the tea-things, and bid Phœbe bring ‘The kettle up.’—Arms and the Monks I sing. IV Some ten miles off, an ancient abbey stood, Amidst the mountains, near a noble stream; A level eminence, enshrined with wood, Slop'd to the river's bank and southern beam; Within were fifty friars fat and good, Of goodly persons, and of good esteem, That pass'd an easy, exemplary life, Remote from want and care, and worldly strife. V Between the Monks and Giants there subsisted, In the first abbot's lifetime, much respect; The Giants let them settle where they listed; The Giants were a tolerating sect. A poor lame Giant once the Monks assisted, Old and abandon'd, dying with neglect, The Prior found him, cured his broken bone, And very kindly cut him for the stone. VI This seem'd a glorious, golden opportunity, To civilize the whole gigantic race; To draw them to pay tithes, and dwell in unity; The Giants' valley was a fertile place, And might have much enrich'd the whole community, Had the old Giant lived a longer space; But he relapsed, and though all means were tried, They could but just baptize him—when he died. VII And, I believe, the Giants never knew Of the kind treatment that befell their mate; He broke down all at once, and all the crew Had taken leave, and left him to his fate; And though the Monks exposed him full in view, Propt on his crutches, at the garden gate, To prove their cure, and shew that all was right, It happen'd that no Giants came in sight: VIII They never found another case to cure, But their demeanour calm and reverential, Their gesture and their vesture grave and pure, Their conduct sober, cautious, and prudential, Engaged respect, sufficient to secure Their properties and interests most essential; They kept a distant, courteous intercourse; Salutes and gestures were their sole discourse. IX Music will civilize, the poets say, In time it might have civiliz'd the Giants; The Jesuits found its use in Paraguay; Orpheus was famous for harmonic science, And civilized the Thracians in that way; My judgment coincides with Mr. Bryant's; He thinks that Orpheus meant a race of cloisterers, Obnoxious to the Bacchanalian roisterers. X Deciphering the symbols of mythology, He finds them Monks, expert in their vocation; Teachers of music, medicine, and theology, The missionaries of the barbarous Thracian; The poet's fable was a wild apology For an inhuman bloody reformation, Which left those tribes uncivilized and rude, Naked and fierce, and painted and tattoo'd. XI It was a glorious jacobinic job To pull down convents, to condemn for treason Poor peeping Pentheus—to carouse and rob, With naked raving goddesses of reason, The festivals and orgies of the mob That every twentieth century come in season. Enough of Orpheus—the succeeding page Relates to Monks of a more recent age; XII And oft that wild untutor'd race would draw, Led by the solemn sound and sacred light Beyond the bank, beneath a lonely shaw, To listen all the livelong summer night, Till deep, serene, and reverential awe Environ'd them with silent calm delight, Contemplating the Minster's midnight gleam, Reflected from the clear and glassy stream; XIII But chiefly, when the shadowy moon had shed O'er woods and waters her mysterious hue, Their passive hearts and vacant fancies fed With thoughts and aspirations strange and new, Till their brute souls with inward working bred Dark hints that in the depth of instinct grew Subjective—not from Locke's associations, Nor David Hartley's doctrine of vibrations. XIV Each was ashamed to mention to the others One half of all the feelings that he felt, Yet thus far each could venture—‘Listen, brothers, ‘It seems as if one heard heaven's thunder melt ‘In music—! all at once it soothes—it smothers— ‘It overpowers one—Pillicock, don't pelt! ‘It seems a kind of shame, a kind of sin, ‘To vex those harmless worthy souls within.’ XV In castles and in courts Ambition dwells, But not in castles or in courts alone; She breathed a wish, throughout those sacred cells, For bells of larger size, and louder tone; Giants abominate the sound of bells, And soon the fierce antipathy was shown, The tinkling and the jingling, and the clangour; Roused their irrational gigantic anger. XVI Unhappy mortals! ever blind to fate! Unhappy Monks! you see no danger nigh; Exulting in their sound and size and weight, From morn till noon the merry peal you ply: The belfry rocks, your bosoms are elate, Your spirits with the ropes and pulleys fly; Tired, but transported, panting, pulling, hauling, Ramping and stamping, overjoy'd and bawling. XVII Meanwhile the solemn mountains that surrounded The silent valley where the convent lay, With tintinnabular uproar were astounded, When the first peal burst forth at break of day: Feeling their granite ears severely wounded, They scarce knew what to think, or what to say; And (though large mountains commonly conceal Their sentiments, dissembling what they feel, XVIII Yet) Cader-Gibbrish from his cloudy throne To huge Loblommon gave an intimation Of this strange rumour, with an awful tone, Thundering his deep surprise and indignation; The lesser hills, in language of their own, Discuss'd the topic by reverberation; Discoursing with their echoes all day long, Their only conversation was, ‘ding-dong.’ XIX Those giant-mountains inwardly were moved, But never made an outward change of place: Not so the mountain-giants—(as behoved A more alert and locomotive race), Hearing a clatter which they disapproved, They ran straight forward to besiege the place With a discordant universal yell, Like house-dogs howling at a dinner-bell. XX Historians are extremely to be pitied, Obliged to persevere in the narration Of wrongs and horrid outrages committed, Oppression, sacrilege, assassination; The following scenes I wish'd to have omitted, But truth is an imperious obligation. So—‘my heart sickens, and I drop my pen,’ And am obliged to pick it up again, XXI And, dipping it afresh, I must transcribe An ancient monkish record, which displays The savage acts of that gigantic tribe; I hope, that from the diction of those days, This noble, national poem will imbibe A something (in the old reviewing phrase), ‘Of an original flavour, and a raciness;’ I should not else transcribe it out of laziness. XXII The writer first relates a dream, or vision, Observed by Luke and Lawrence in their cells, And a nocturnal hideous apparition Of fiends and devils dancing round the bells: This last event is stated with precision; Their persons he describes, their names he tells, Klaproth, Tantallan, Barbanel, Belphegor, Long-tail'd, long-talon'd, hairy, black, and meagre. XXIII He then rehearses sundry marvels more, Damping the mind with horror by degrees, Of a prodigious birth a heifer bore, Of mermaids seen in the surrounding seas, Of a sea-monster that was cast ashore; Earthquakes and thunder-stones, events like these, Which served to shew the times were out of joint, And then proceeds directly to the point. XXIV Erant rumores et timores varii; Dies horroris et confusionis Evenit in calendis Januarii; Gigantes, semen maledictionis Nostri potentes impii adversarii, Irascebantur campanarum sonis, Horâ secundâ centum tres gigantes Venerunt ante januam ululantes. XXV At fratres pleni desolationis, Stabant ad necessarium præsidium, Perterriti pro vitis et pro bonis, Et perduravit hoc crudele obsidium, Nostri claustralis pauperis Sionis, Ad primum diem proximorum Idium; Tunc in triumpho fracto tintinnabulo, Gigantes ibant alibi pro pabulo. XXVI Sed frater Isidorus decumbebat In lecto per tres menses brachio fracto, Nam lapides Mangonellus jaciebat, Et fregit tintinnabulum lapide jacto; Et omne vicinagium destruebat, Et nihil relinquebat de intacto, Ardens molinos, Casas, messuagia, Et alia multa damna atque outragia. XXVII Those Monks were poor proficients in divinity, And scarce knew more of Latin than myself; Compared with theirs they say that true Latinity Appears like porcelain compared with delf; As for the damage done in the vicinity, Those that have laid their Latin on the shelf May like to read the subsequent narration Done into metre from a friend's translation. XXVIII Squire Humphry Bamberham, of Boozley Hall, (Whose name I mention with deserved respect), On market-days was often pleased to call, And to suggest improvements, or correct; I own the obligation once for all, Lest critics should imagine they detect Traces of learning and superior reading, Beyond, as they suppose, my birth and breeding. XXIX Papers besides, and transcripts most material, He gave me when I went to him to dine; A trunk full, one coach-seat, and an imperial, One band-box—But the work is wholly mine; The tone, the form, the colouring etherial, ‘The vision and the faculty divine,’ The scenery, characters, and triple-rhymes, I'll swear it—like old Walter of the Times. XXX Long, long before, upon a point of weight, Such as a ring of bells complete and new, Chapters were summon'd, frequent, full, and late; The point was view'd in every point of view, Till, after fierce discussion and debate, The wiser monks, the wise are always few, That from the first opposed the plan in toto, Were over-borne, canonicali voto. XXXI A prudent monk, their reader and librarian, Observed a faction, angry, strong, and warm, (Himself an anti-tintinnabularian), He saw, or thought he saw, a party form To scout him as an alien and sectarian. There was an undefined impending storm! The opponents were united, bold, and hot; They might degrade, imprison him—what not? XXXII Now faction in a city, camp, or cloister, While it is yet a tender raw beginner, Is nourish'd by superfluous warmth and moisture, Namely, by warmth and moisture after dinner; And therefore, till the temper and the posture Of things should alter—till a secret inner Instinctive voice should whisper, all is right— He deem'd it safest to keep least in sight. XXXIII He felt as if his neck were in a noose, And evermore retired betimes from table, For fear of altercation and abuse, But made the best excuse that he was able; He never rose without a good excuse, (Like Master Stork invited in the fable To Mr. Fox's dinner); there he sat, Impatient to retire and take his hat. XXXIV For only once or twice that he remain'd To change this constant formal course, he found His brethren awkward, sullen, and constrain'd, —He caught the conversation at a bound, And, with a hurried agitation, strain'd His wits to keep it up, and drive it round. —It saved him—but he felt the risk and danger, Behaved-to like a pleasant utter stranger. XXXV Wise people sometimes will pretend to sleep, And watch and listen while they droop and snore— He felt himself a kind of a black sheep, But studied to be neither less nor more Obliging than became him—but to keep His temper, style, and manner as before; It seem'd the best, the safest, only plan, Never to seem to feel as a mark'd man. XXXVI Wise Curs, when canister'd, refuse to run; They merely crawl and creep about, and whine, And disappoint the Boys, and spoil the fun— That picture is too mean—this Monk of mine Ennobled it, as others since have done, With grace and ease, and grandeur of design; He neither ran nor howl'd, nor crept nor turn'd, But wore it as he walk'd, quite unconcern'd. XXXVII To manifest the slightest want of nerve Was evidently perfect, utter ruin, Therefore the seeming to recant or swerve, By meddling any way with what was doing, He felt within himself would only serve To bring down all the mischief that was brewing; “No duty binds me, no constraint compels “To bow before the Dagon of the Bells, XXXVIII “To flatter this new foolery, to betray “My vote, my conscience, and my better sense, “By bustling in the Belfry day by day; “But in the Grange, the Cellar, or the Spence, “(While all are otherwise employ'd), I may “Deserve their thanks, at least avoid offence; “For (while this vile anticipated clatter “Fills all their hearts and senses), every matter XXXIX “Behoveful for our maintenance and needs “Is wholly disregarded, and the course “Of our conventual management proceeds “At random, day by day, from bad to worse; “The Larder dwindles and the Cellar bleeds! “Besides,—besides the bells, we must disburse “For masonry, for frame-work, wheels and fliers; “Next winter we must fast like genuine friars.” XL As Bees, that when the skies are calm and fair, In June, or the beginning of July, Launch forth colonial settlers in the air, Round, round, and round-about, they whiz, they fly, With eager worry whirling here and there, They know not whence, nor whither, where, nor why, In utter hurry-scurry, going, coming, Maddening the summer air with ceaseless humming; XLI Till the strong Frying-pan's energic jangle With thrilling thrum their feebler hum doth drown, Then passive and appeased, they droop and dangle, Clinging together close, and clustering down, Link'd in a multitudinous living tangle Like an old Tassel of a dingy brown; The joyful Farmer sees, and spreads his hay, And reckons on a settled sultry day. XLII E'en so the Monks, as wild as sparks of fire, (Or swarms unpacified by pan or kettle), Ran restless round the Cloisters and the Quire, Till those huge masses of sonorous metal Attracted them toward the Tower and Spire; There you might see them cluster, crowd, and settle, Throng'd in the hollow tintinnabular Hive; The Belfry swarm'd with Monks; it seem'd alive. XLIII Then, while the Cloisters, Courts, and Yards were still, Silent and empty, like a long vacation; The Friar prowl'd about, intent to fill Details of delegated occupation, Which, with a ready frankness and good will, He undertook; he said, “the obligation “Was nothing—nothing—he could serve their turn “While they were busy with this new concern.” XLIV Combining prudence with a scholar's pride, Poor Tully, like a toad beneath a harrow, Twitch'd, jerk'd, and haul'd and maul'd on every side, Tried to identify himself with Varro; This course our cautious Friar might have tried, But his poor convent was a field too narrow; There was not, from the Prior to the Cook, A single soul that cared about a book: XLV Yet, sitting with his books, he felt unclogg'd Unfetter'd; and for two hours together tasted The calm delight of being neither dogg'd, Nor watch'd, nor worried; he transcribed, he pasted, Repair'd old Bindings, index'd, catalogued, Illuminated, mended Clasps, and wasted An hour or two sometimes in actual reading; Meanwhile the belfry business was proceeding; XLVI And the first opening Peal, the grand display, In prospect ever present to his mind, Was fast approaching, pregnant with dismay, With loathing and with horror undefined, Like the expectation of an Ague-day; The day before he neither supp'd nor dined, And felt beforehand, for a fortnight near, A kind of deafness in his fancy's ear: XLVII But most he fear'd his ill-digested spleen, Inflamed by gibes, might lead him on to wrangle, Or discompose, at least, his looks and mien; So, with the Belfry's first prelusive jangle, He sallied from the Garden-gate unseen, With his worst hat, his boots, his line and angle, Meaning to pass away the time, and bring Some fish for supper, as a civil thing. XLVIII The prospect of their after-supper talk Employ'd his thoughts, forecasting many a scoff, Which he with quick reply must damp and balk, Parrying at once, without a hem or cough, “Had not the bells annoy'd him in his walk?— “No, faith! he liked them best when farthest off.” Thus he prepared and practised many a sentence, Expressing ease, good-humour, independence. XLIX His ground-bait had been laid the night before, Most fortunately!—for he used to say, ‘That more than once the belfry's bothering roar ‘Almost induced him to remove away;’ Had he so done,—the gigantean corps Had sack'd the convent on that very day, But providentially the perch and dace Bit freely, which detain'd him at the place. L And here let us detain ourselves awhile, My dear Thalia! party's angry frown And petty malice in that monkish pile, (The warfare of the cowl and of the gown), Had almost dried my wits and drain'd my style; Here, with our legs, then, idly dangling down, We'll rest upon the bank, and dip our toes In the poetic current as it flows. LI Or in the narrow sunny plashes near, Observe the puny piscatory Swarm, That with their tiny Squadrons tack and veer, Cruising amidst the shelves and shallows warm, Chasing, or in retreat, with hope or fear Of petty plunder or minute alarm; With clannish instinct how they wheel and face, Inherited arts inherent in the race; LII Or mark the jetty, glossy Tribes that glance Upon the water's firm unruffled breast, Tracing their ancient labyrinthic dance In mute mysterious cadence unexpress'd; Alas! that fresh disaster and mischance Again must drive us from our place of rest! Grim Mangonel, with his outrageous crew, Will scare us hence within an hour or two. LIII Poets are privileged to run away— Alcæus and Archilochus could fling Their shields behind them in a doubtful fray; And still sweet Horace may be heard to sing His filthy fright upon Philippi's day; (—You can retire, too—for the Muse's wing Is swift as Cupid's pinion when he flies, Alarm'd at periwigs and human Tyes). LIV This practice was approved in times of yore, Though later bards behav'd like gentlemen, And Garcilasso, Camoens, many more, Disclaim'd the privilege of book and pen; And bold Aneurin, all bedripp'd with gore, Bursting by force from the beleaguer'd glen, Arrogant, haughty, fierce, of fiery mood, Not meek and mean, as Gray misunderstood. LV But we, that write a mere Campaigning Tour, May choose a station for our point of view That's picturesque and perfectly secure; Come, now we'll sketch the friar—That will do— ‘Designs and etchings by an amateur;’ ‘A frontispiece, and a vignette or two:’ But much I fear that aqua-tint and etching Will scarce keep pace with true poetic sketching. LVI Dogs that inhabit near the banks of Nile, (As ancient authors or old proverbs say), Dreading the cruel critic Crocodile, Drink as they run, a mouthful and away; 'Tis a true model for descriptive style; “Keep moving,” (as the man says in the play), The power of motion is the poet's forte— Therefore, again, “keep moving! that's your sort!” LVII For, otherwise, while you persist and paint, With your portfolio pinion'd to a spot, Half of your picture grows effaced and faint, Imperfectly remember'd, or forgot; Make sketch, then, upon sketch; and if they a'n't Complete, it does not signify a jot; Leave graphic illustrations of your work To be devised by Westall or by Smirke. LVIII I'll speak my mind at once, in spite of raillery; I've thought and thought again a thousand times, What a magnificent Poetic Gallery Might be design'd from my Stowmarket rhymes; I look for no reward, nor fee, nor salary, I look for England's fame in foreign climes And future ages—Honos alit Artes, And such a plan would reconcile all parties. LIX I'm strongly for the present state of things; I look for no reform, nor innovation, Because our present Parliaments and Kings Are competent to improve and rule the Nation, Provided Projects that true Genius brings Are held in due respect and estimation. I've said enough—and now you must be wishing To see the landscape, and the friar fishing. CANTO IV. I A mighty current, unconfin'd and free, Ran wheeling round beneath the mountain's shade, Battering its wave-worn base; but you might see On the near margin many a watery glade, Becalm'd beneath some little island's lee All tranquil, and transparent, close embay'd; Reflecting in the deep serene and even Each flower and herb, and every cloud of Heaven; II The painted kingfisher, the branch above her, Stand in the sultry mirror fixt and true; Anon the fitful breezes brood and hover, Freshening the surface with a rougher hue; Spreading, withdrawing, pausing, passing over, Again returning to retire anew: So rest and motion, in a narrow range, Feasted the sight with joyous interchange. III The Monk with handy jerk, and petty baits, Stands twitching out apace the perch and roach; His mightier tackle, pitch'd apart, awaits The grovelling barbel's unobserved approach: And soon his motley meal of homely Cates Is spread, the leather bottle is a-broach; Eggs, Bacon, Ale, a Napkin, Cheese and Knife, Forming a charming Picture of Still-life. IV The Friar fishing—a design for Cuyp, A cabinet jewel—‘Pray remark the boot; ‘And, leading from the light, that shady stripe, ‘With the dark bulrush-heads how well they suit; ‘And then, that mellow tint so warm and ripe, ‘That falls upon the cassock, and surtout:’ If it were fairly painted, puff'd and sold, My gallery would be worth its weight in gold. V But hark!—the busy Chimes fall fast and strong, Clattering and pealing in their full career; Closely the thickening sounds together throng, No longer painful to the Friar's ear, They bind his Fancy with illusion strong; While his rapt Spirit hears, or seems to hear, “Turn, turn again—gen—gèn, thou noble Friar, “Eleele—lèele—lèele—lected Prior.” VI Thus the mild Monk, as he unhook'd a gudgeon, Stood musing—when far other sounds arise, Sounds of despite and ire, and direful dudgeon; And soon across the River he espies, In wrathful act, a hideous huge Curmudgeon Calling his Comrades on with shouts and cries, “There!—there it is!—I told them so before;” He left his Line and Hook, and said no more; VII But ran right forward, (pelted all the way), And bolted breathless at the Convent-gate, The messenger and herald of dismay; But soon with conscious worth, and words of weight, Gives orders which the ready Monks obey: Doors, windows, wickets, are blockaded straight; He reinspires the Convent's drooping sons, Is here and there, and everywhere, at once. VIII “Friends! fellow-Monks!” he cried, (“for well you know “That mightiest Giants must in vain essay “Across yon river's foaming gulf to go:) “The mountainous, obscure and winding way, “That guides their footsteps to the Ford below, “Affords a respite of desired delay— “Seize then the passing hour!”—the Monk kept bawling, In terms to this effect, though not so drawling. IX His words were these, “Before the Ford is crost, “We've a good hour,—at least three-quarters good— “Bestir yourselves, my lads, or all is lost— “Drive down this Staunchion, bring those Spars of wood; “This Bench will serve—here, wedge it to the Post; “Come, Peter, quick! strip off your Gown and Hood— “Take up the Mallet, Man, and bang away! “Tighten these Ropes—now lash them, and belay. X “Finish the job while I return—I fear “Yon Postern-gate will prove the Convent's ruin; “You, brother John, my Namesake! stay you here, “And give an eye to what these Monks are doing; “Bring out the scalding Sweet-wort, and the Beer, “Keep up the Stoke-hole fire, where we were brewing: “And pull the Gutters up and melt the Lead— “(Before a dozen aves can be said,) XI “I shall be back amongst you.”—Forth he went, Secured the Postern, and return'd again, Disposing all with high arbitrement, With earnest air, and visage on the main Concern of public safety fixt and bent; For now the Giants, stretching o'er the plain, Are seen, presenting in the dim horizon Tall awful forms, horrific and surprising— XII I'd willingly walk barefoot fifty mile, To find a scholar, or divine, or squire, That could assist me to devise a Style Fit to describe the conduct of the Friar; I've tried three different ones within a while, The Grave, the Vulgar, and the grand High-flyer; All are I think improper, more or less, I'll take my chance amongst 'em—you shall guess. XIII Intrepid, eager, ever prompt to fly Where danger and the Convent's safety call; Where doubtful points demand a judging eye, Where on the massy gates huge maces fall; Where missile vollied rocks are whirl'd on high, Pre-eminent upon the embattled wall, In gesture, and in voice, he stands confest; Exhorting all the Monks to do their best. XIV We redescend to phrase of low degree— For there's a point which you must wish to know, The real ruling Abbot—where was he? For (since we make so classical a show, Our Convent's mighty structure, as you see, Like Thebes or Troy beleaguer'd by the foe; Our Friar scuffling like a kind of Cocles), You'll figure him perhaps like Eteocles XV In Æschylus, with sentries, guards and watches, Ready for all contingencies arising, Pitting his chosen chiefs in equal matches Against the foe—anon soliloquizing; Then occupied anew with fresh dispatches— Nothing like this!—but something more surprising— Was he like Priam then—that's stranger far— That in the ninth year of his Trojan war, XVI Knew not the names or persons of his foes, But merely points them out as stout or tall, While (as no Trojan knew them, I suppose), Helen attends her father to the wall, To tell him long details of these and those? 'Twas not like this, but strange and odd withal; ‘Nobody knows it—nothing need be said, ‘Our poor dear Abbot is this instant dead. XVII ‘They wheel'd him out, you know, to take the air— ‘It must have been an apoplectic fit— ‘He tumbled forward from his garden-chair— ‘He seem'd completely gone, but warm as yet: ‘I wonder how they came to leave him there; ‘Poor soul! he wanted courage, heart, and wit ‘For Times like these—the Shock and the Surprise! 'Twas very natural the Gout should rise. XVIII ‘But such a sudden end was scarce expected; ‘Our parties will be puzzled to proceed; ‘The belfry set divided and dejected: ‘The crisis is a strange one, strange indeed; ‘I'll bet yon fighting Friar is elected; ‘It often happens in the hour of need, ‘From popular ideas of utility, ‘People are pitch'd upon for mere ability. XIX ‘I'll hint the subject, and communicate ‘The sad event—He's standing there apart; ‘Our offer, to be sure, comes somewhat late, ‘But then, we never thought he meant to start, ‘And if he gains his end, at any rate, ‘He has an understanding and a heart; ‘He'll serve or he'll protect his friends, at least, ‘With better spirit than the poor deceased; XX ‘The convent was all going to the devil ‘While he, poor creature, thought himself beloved ‘For saying handsome things, and being civil, ‘Wheeling about as he was pull'd and shoved, ‘By way of leaving things to find their level.’ The funeral sermon ended, both approved, And went to Friar John, who merely doubted The fact, and wish'd them to enquire about it; XXI Then left them, and return'd to the attack: They found their Abbot in his former place; They took him up and turn'd him on his back; At first (you know) he tumbled on his face: They found him fairly stiff, and cold, and black; They then unloosed each ligature and lace, His neckcloth and his girdle, hose and garters, And took him up, and lodged him in his quarters. XXII Bees serv'd me for a simile before, And bees again—‘Bees that have lost their king,’ Would seem a repetition and a bore; Besides, in fact, I never saw the thing; And though those phrases from the good old store Of “feebler hummings and a flagging wing,” Perhaps may be descriptive and exact; I doubt it; I confine myself to fact. XXIII Thus much is certain, that a mighty pother Arises; that the frame and the condition Of things is alter'd, they combine and bother, And every winged insect politician Is warm and eager till they choose another. In our monastic Hive the same ambition Was active and alert; but angry fortune Constrain'd them to contract the long, importune, XXIV Tedious, obscure, inexplicable train, Qualification, form, and oath and test, Ballots on ballots, ballotted again; Accessits, scrutinies, and all the rest; Theirs was the good old method, short and plain; Per acclamationem they invest Their fighting Friar John with Robes and Ring, Crozier and Mitre, Seals, and every thing. XXV With a new warlike active Chief elected, Almost at once, it scarce can be conceived What a new spirit, real or affected, Prevail'd throughout; the monks complained and grieved That nothing was attempted or projected; While Quiristers and Novices believed That their new fighting Abbot, Friar John, Would sally forth at once, and lead them on. XXVI I pass such gossip, and devote my cares By diligent inquiry to detect The genuine state and posture of affairs: Unmanner'd, uninform'd, and incorrect, Falsehood and Malice hold alternate chairs, And lecture and preside in Envy's sect; The fortunate and great she never spares, Sowing the soil of history with tares. XXVII Thus, jealous of the truth, and feeling loth That Sir Nathaniel henceforth should accuse Our noble Monk of cowardice and sloth, I'll print the Affidavit of the Muse, And state the facts as ascertain'd on Oath, Corroborated by Surveys and Views, When good King Arthur granted them a Brief, And Ninety Groats were raised for their relief. XXVIII Their arbours, walks, and alleys were defaced, Riven and uprooted, and with ruin strown, And the fair Dial in their garden placed Batter'd by barbarous hands, and overthrown; The Deer with wild pursuit dispersed and chased, The Dove-house ransack'd, and the Pigeons flown; The Cows all kill'd in one promiscuous slaughter, The Sheep all drown'd, and floating in the water. XXIX The Mill was burn'd down to the water-wheels; The Giants broke away the Dam and Sluice, Dragg'd up and emptied all the Fishing-reels; Drain'd and destroy'd the Reservoir and Stews, Wading about, and groping carp and eels; In short, no single earthly thing of use Remain'd untouch'd beyond the convent's wall: The Friars from their windows view'd it all. XXX But the bare hope of personal defence, The church, the convent's, and their own protection, Absorb'd their thoughts, and silenced every sense Of present loss, till Friar John's election; Then other schemes arose, I know not whence, Whether from flattery, zeal, or disaffection, But the brave Monk, like Fabius with Hannibal, Against internal faction, and the cannibal XXXI Inhuman foe, that threaten'd from without, Stood firmly, with a self-sufficing mind, Impregnable to rumour, fear, or doubt, Determined that the casual, idle, blind Event of battle with that barbarous Rout, Flush'd with success and garbage, should not bind Their future destinies, or fix the seal Of ruin on the claustral Common-weal. XXXII He check'd the rash, the boisterous, and the proud, By speech and action, manly but discreet; During the siege he never once allow'd Of chapters, or convoked the monks to meet, Dreading the consultations of a crowd. Historic parallels we sometimes meet— I think I could contrive one—if you please, I shall compare our Monk to Pericles. XXXIII In Former Times, amongst the Athenians bold, This Pericles was placed in high command, Heading their troops (as statesmen used of old), In all their wars and fights by sea and land; Besides, in Langhorne's Plutarch we are told How many fine ingenious things he plann'd; For Phidias was an Architect and Builder, Jeweller and Engraver, Carver, Gilder; XXXIV But altogether quite expert and clever; Pericles took him up and stood his friend, Persuading these Athenians to endeavour To raise a Work to last to the world's end, By means of which their Fame should last for ever; Likewise an Image (which, you comprehend, They meant to pray to, for the country's good): They had before an old one made of wood, XXXV But being partly rotten and decay'd, They wish'd to have a new one spick and span, So Pericles advised it should be made According to this Phidias's plan, Of ivory, with gold all overlaid, Of the height of twenty cubits and a span, Making eleven yards of English measure, All to be paid for from the public treasure. XXXVI So Phidias's talents were requited With talents that were spent upon the work, And every body busied and delighted, Building a Temple—this was their next quirk— Lest it should think itself ill-used and slighted. This Temple now belongs to the Grand Turk, The finest in the world allowed to be, That people go five hundred miles to see. XXXVII Its ancient Carvings are safe here at home, Brought round by shipping from as far as Greece, Finer, they say, than all the things at Rome; But here you need not pay a penny-piece; But curious people, if they like to come, May look at them as often as they please— I've left my subject, but I was not sorry To mention things that raise the country's glory. XXXVIII Well, Pericles made every thing complete, Their town, their harbour, and their city wall; When their allies rebell'd, he made them treat And pay for peace, and tax'd and fined them all, By which means Pericles maintain'd a fleet, And kept three hundred galleys at his call; Pericles was a man for every thing; Pericles was a kind of petty king. XXXIX It happen'd Sparta was another State; They thought themselves as good; they could not bear To see the Athenians grown so proud and great, Ruling and domineering every where, And so resolved, before it grew too late, To fight it out and settle the affair; Then, being quite determined to proceed, They muster'd an amazing force indeed; XL And (after praying to their idol Mars) March'd on, with all the allies that chose to join, As was the practice in old heathen wars, Destroying all the fruit-trees, every vine, And smashing and demolishing the jars In which those classic ancients kept their wine; The Athenians ran within the city wall To save themselves, their children, wives, and all. XLI Then Pericles (whom they compar'd to Jove, As being apt to storm and play the deuce), Kept quiet, and forbad the troops to move, Because a battle was no kind of use; The more they mutinied, the more he strove To keep them safe in spite of their abuse, For while the Farms were ransack'd round the Town, This was the people's language up and down: XLII ‘'Tis better to die once than live to see ‘Such an abomination, such a waste;’ ‘No! no!’ says Pericles, ‘that must not be, ‘You're too much in hurry,—too much haste— ‘Learned Athenians, leave the thing to me; ‘You think of being bullied and disgraced; ‘Don't think of that, nor answer their defiance; ‘We'll gain the day by our superior science.’ XLIII Pericles led the people as he pleased, But in most cases something is forgot: What with the crowd and heat they grew diseased, And died in heaps like wethers with the rot; And, at the last, the same distemper seized Poor Pericles himself—he went to pot. It answer'd badly;—therefore I admire So much the more the conduct of the Friar. XLIV For in the Garrison where he presided, Neither distress, nor famine, nor disease, Were felt, nor accident nor harm betided The happy Monks; but plenteous, and with ease, All needful monkish viands were provided; Bacon and Pickled-herring, Pork and Peas; And when the Table-beer began to fail, They found resources in the Bottled-ale. XLV Dinner and supper kept their usual hours; Breakfast and luncheon never were delay'd, While to the sentries on the walls and towers Between two plates hot messes were convey'd. At the departure of the invading powers, It was a boast the noble Abbot made, None of his Monks were weaker, paler, thinner, Or, during all the siege, had lost a dinner. XLVI This was the common course of their hostility; The giant forces being foil'd at first, Had felt the manifest impossibility Of carrying things before them at a burst, But still, without a prospect of utility, At stated hours they pelted, howl'd, and cursed; And sometimes, at the peril of their pates, Would bang with clubs and maces at the gates; XLVII Them the brave monkish legions, unappall'd, With stones that served before to pave the court, (Heap'd and prepared at hand), repell'd and maul'd, Without an effort, smiling as in sport, With many a broken head, and many a scald From stones and molten lead and boiling wort; Thus little Pillicock was left for dead, And old Loblolly forced to keep his bed. XLVIII The giant-troops invariably withdrew, (Like mobs in Naples, Portugal, and Spain), To dine at twelve o'clock, and sleep till two, And afterwards (except in case of rain), Return'd to clamour, hoot, and pelt anew. The scene was every day the same again; Thus the Blockade grew tedious: I intended A week ago, myself, to raise and end it. XLIX One morn the drowsy Centry rubb'd his eyes, Foil'd by the scanty, baffling, early light; It seem'd, a Figure of inferior size Was traversing the Giants' camp outright; And soon a Monkish Form they recognize— And now their brother Martin stands in sight, That on that morning of alarm and fear Had rambled out to see the Salmon-Weir; L Passing the Ford, the Giants' first attack Left brother Martin's station in their rear, And thus prevented him from falling back; But during all the Siege he watch'd them near, Saw them returning by their former Track The Night before, and found the Camp was clear; And so return'd in safety with delight And rapture, and a ravenous appetite. LI “Well! welcome,—welcome, brother!—Brother Martin! “Why, Martin!—we could scarce believe our eyes: “Ah, brother! strange events here since our parting—” And Martin dined (dispensing brief replies To all the questions that the monks were starting, Betwixt his mouthfuls), while each friar vies In filling, helping, carving, questioning; So Martin dined in public like a king. LII And now the Gates are open'd, and the Throng Forth issuing, the deserted Camp survey; ‘Here Murdomack, and Mangonel the strong, ‘And Gorboduc were lodged,’ and ‘here,’ they say, ‘This pigsty to Poldavy did belong; ‘Here Brindleback, and here Phagander lay.’ They view the deep indentures, broad and round, Which mark their posture squatting on the ground. LIII Then to the traces of gigantic feet, Huge, wide apart, with half a dozen toes; They track them on, till they converge and meet, (An earnest and assurance of repose) Close at the Ford; the cause of this retreat They all conjecture, but no creature knows; It was ascribed to causes multifarious, To saints, as Jerom, George and Januarius, LIV To their own pious founder's intercession, To Ave-Maries, and our Lady's Psalter; To news that Friar John was in possession, To new wax candles placed upon the altar, To their own prudence, valour, and discretion; To reliques, rosaries, and holy water; To beads and psalms, and feats of arms—in short, There was no end of their accounting for't: LV But though they could not, you, perhaps, may guess; They went, in short, upon their last adventure, After the Ladies—neither more nor less— Our story now revolves upon its centre, And I'm rejoiced myself, I must confess, To find it tally like an old indenture; They drove off Mules and Horses half a score, The same that you saw roasted heretofore. LVI Our Giants' memoirs still remain on hand, For all my notions, being genuine gold, Beat out beneath the hammer and expand, And multiply themselves a thousandfold Beyond the first idea that I plann'd; Besides,—this present copy must be sold: Besides,—I promised Murray t'other day, To let him have it by the tenth of May. END OF CANTO IV. MISCELLANIES. FABLES FOR FIVE YEARS OLD. FABLE I. Of the Boy and his Top. A little boy had bought a Top, The best in all the toyman's shop; He made a whip with good eel's-skin, He lash'd the top, and made it spin; All the children within call, And the servants, one and all, Stood round to see it and admire. At last the Top began to tire, He cried out, “Pray don't whip me, Master, “You whip too hard,—I can't spin faster, “I can spin quite as well without it.” The little Boy replied, “I doubt it; “I only whip you for your good, “You were a foolish lump of wood, “By dint of whipping you were raised “To see yourself admired and praised, “And if I left you, you'd remain “A foolish lump of wood again.” Explanation. Whipping sounds a little odd, It don't mean whipping with a rod, It means to teach a boy incessantly, Whether by lessons or more pleasantly, Every hour and every day, By every means, in every way, By reading, writing, rhyming, talking, By riding to see sights, and walking: If you leave off he drops at once, A lumpish, wooden-headed dunce. FABLE II. Of the Boy and the Parrot Parrot, if I had your wings, “I should do so many things. “The first thing I should like to do “If I had little wings like you, “I should fly to uncle Bartle. “Don't you think 'twould make him startle, “If he saw me when I came, “Flapping at the window-frame, “Exactly like the print of Fame?” All this the wise old Parrot heard, The Parrot was an ancient bird, And paused and ponder'd every word. First, therefore, he began to cough, Then said,—“It is a great way off,— “A great way off, My Dear:”—and then He paused awhile, and cough'd again,— “Master John, pray think a little, “What will you do for beds and victual?” —“Oh! parrot, uncle John can tell— “But we should manage very well. “At night we'd perch upon the trees, “And so fly forward by degrees.”— —“Does uncle John,” the parrot said, “Put nonsense in his nephew's head? “Instead of telling you such things, “And teaching you to wish for wings, “I think he might have taught you better; “You might have learnt to write a letter:— “That is the thing that I should do “If I had little hands like you.” FABLE III. Of the Boy and the Wolf. A little boy was set to keep A little flock of goats or sheep. He thought the task too solitary, And took a strange perverse vagary, To call the people out of fun, To see them leave their work and run, He cried and scream'd with all his might,— “Wolf! wolf!” in a pretended fright. Some people, working at a distance, Came running in to his assistance. They search'd the fields and bushes round, The Wolf was no where to be found. The Boy, delighted with his game, A few days after did the same, And once again the People came. The trick was many times repeated, At last they found that they were cheated. One day the wolf appeared in sight, The Boy was in a real fright, He cried, “Wolf! wolf!”—The Neighbours heard, But not a single creature stirr'd. “We need not go from our employ,— “'Tis nothing but that idle boy.” The little boy cried out again, “Help, help! the Wolf!”—he cried in vain. At last his master went to beat him, He came too late, the wolf had eat him. This shews the bad effects of lying, And likewise of continual crying; If I had heard you scream and roar, For nothing, twenty times before, Although you might have broke your arm, Or met with any serious harm, Your cries could give me no alarm, They would not make me move the faster, Nor apprehend the least disaster; I should be sorry when I came, But you yourself would be to blame. FABLE IV. Of the Piece of Glass and the Piece of Ice. Once on a time, it came to pass, A piece of ice and piece of glass Were lying on a bank together. There came a sudden change of weather, The sun shone through them both.—The ice Turn'd to his neighbour for advice. The piece of glass made this reply,— “Take care by all means not to cry.” The foolish piece of ice relied On being pitied if he cried. The story says—That he cried on Till he was melted and quite gone. This may serve you for a rule With the little boys at school; If you weep, I must forewarn ye, All the boys will teaze and scorn ye. FABLE V. Of the Cavern and the Hut. An ancient cavern, huge and wide, Was hollow'd in a mountain's side, It served no purpose that I know, Except to shelter sheep or so, Yet it was spacious, warm, and dry. There stood a little hut hard by.— The cave was empty quite, and poor, The hut was full of furniture; By looking to his own affairs, He got a table and some chairs, All useful instruments of metal, A pot, a frying-pan, a kettle, A clock, a warming-pan, a jack, A salt-box and a bacon-rack; With plates, and knives, and forks, and dishes, And lastly, to complete his wishes, He got a sumptuous pair of bellows.— The cavern was extremely jealous: “How can that paltry hut contrive “In this poor neighbourhood to thrive?”— “The reason's plain,” replied the hut, “Because I keep my mouth close shut; “Whatever my good master brings, “For furniture, or household things, “I keep them close, and shut the door, “While you stand yawning evermore.” If a little boy is yawning At his lessons every morning, Teaching him in prose or rhyme Will be merely loss of time; All your pains are thrown away, Nothing will remain a day, (Nothing you can teach or say, Nothing he has heard or read,) In his poor unfurnish'd head. FABLE VI. Showing how the Cavern followed the Hut's Advice. This fable is a very short one: The cave resolved to make his fortune; He got a door, and in a year Enrich'd himself with wine and beer. Mamma will ask you, can you tell her, What did the cave become?—A cellar. FABLE VII. By Master John's desire, about the Rod and the Whip. The Rod and Whip had some disputes; One managed boys, the other brutes, Each pleaded his superior nature, The Goad was chosen arbitrator, A judge acquainted with the matter, Upright, inflexible, and dry, And always pointed in reply:— “'Tis hard,” he said, “to pass a sentence, “Betwixt two near and old acquaintance; “The Whip alleges that he drives “The plough, by which the farmer lives, “And keeps his horses in obedience, “And on this ground he claims precedence. “The Rod asserts, that little boys, “With nonsense, nastiness, and noise, “Screaming, and quarrelling, and fighting, “Not knowing figures, books, or writing, “Would be far worse than farmer's horses, “But for the rules which he enforces— “He proves his claim as clear as day, “So Whips and Goads must both give way.” FABLE VIII. Of the Nine-pins. (Being a Fable for Six Years Old.) A ninepin that was left alone, When all his friends were overthrown, Every minute apprehending, The destructive stroke impending, Earnestly complain'd and cried; But Master Henry thus replied:— “Are you the wisest and the best? “Or any better than the rest? “While you linger to the last, “How has all your time been past? “Standing stupid, unimproved, “Idle, useless, unbeloved; “Nothing you can do or say “Shall debar me from my play.” The Nine-pins you perceive are men, 'Tis death that answers them again; And the fable's moral truth, Suits alike with age and youth. How can age of death complain, If his life has past in vain? How can youth deserve to last If his life is idly past? And the final application, Marks the separate obligation, Fairly placed within our reach, Your's to learn, and mine to teach. A FABLE. A dingy donkey, formal and unchanged, Browzed in the lane and o'er the common ranged, Proud of his ancient asinine possessions, Free from the panniers of the grave professions He lived at ease; and chancing once to find A lion's skin, the fancy took his mind To personate the monarch of the wood; And for a time the stratagem held good. He moved with so majestical a pace That bears and wolves and all the savage race Gazed in admiring awe, ranging aloof, Not over anxious for a clearer proof— Longer he might have triumphed—but alas! In an unguarded hour it came to pass He brayed aloud; and shewed himself an ass! The moral of this tale I could not guess Till Mr. Landor sent his works to press. AN APPEAL TO THE PROFESSORS OF ART AND LITERATURE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ON BEHALF OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR, ESQUIRE; CONCLUDING WITH A RESPECTFUL REPRESENTATION TO THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY. Ye painters and engravers! hear my call, Sculptors and poets, artists one and all, Let Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Walter Scott, Pitt, Fox, and Burke, and Canning be forgot: —Pre-eminent in priggery supreme Let Walter Savage Landor be your theme: Neither a Tory, Radical, nor Whig, But an immaculate consummate prig! —Ye Shaftesbury's and prigs of elder time, Less perfect, and of priggery less sublime, In those Elysian fields where now you tread Engaged in conversations with the dead, With contemplation of the immortal Plato, And admiration of the virtuous Cato, And other mighty prigs renowned in story; Alas, alas, for your departed glory! Here Walter Savage Landor comes to snatch The laurel from the brows of all your batch! Rise then, and with profound obeisance greet Bowing at Walter Savage Landor's feet! And own yourselves (as needs you must confess, In prose less prosy, and in priggishness, Beyond dispute, immeasurably less— But I proceed too fast. It may be said That Walter Savage Landor is not dead. 'Tis well observed, and therefore I return To speak a word to those it may concern— Painters and artists (as I said before) I wish you to proceed on a new score. Let Walter Savage Landor's glorious noddle Be your exclusive, universal model. Work! Work upon it! with renewed delight, Work! Work (I tell ye) morning, noon, and night, That in shop windows it may charm the sight, Attracting every gaze; eclipsing all Modern celebrities, both great and small, Whiggish, Conservative, and Radical. —Ye printsellers all! wherefore should ye deal In lithographs of Wellington and Peel, O'Connells, and Lord Melbournes, and Lord Johns? List to my words! discard them all at once! Compared, I say, with Walter Savage Landor The most distinguished statesman and commander In future ages will be deemed a gander. Yes! Walter Savage Landor beats them hollow, Away with them; let wits and poets follow, Let the great Landor be your great Apollo; Discard Lord Byron with his loose shirt collar, Our glorious Landor is a better scholar, Riper, as Shakespeare has it, and completer, And makes Hendecasyllables in metre As good as any fifth-form boy could do, Without false quantities, or very few; And tho' Lord Byron's peerage ranks him higher, Yet Mister Landor writes himself “Esquire,” And keeps a groom! and boasts himself to be A scion of heraldic ancestry, Wearing a coat of arms upon his seal! A circumstance which animates his zeal Against a base plebeian prelacy, Fellows without a genealogy! Poised on the cherub contemplation's wings, His lordship sits blaspheming as he sings, Cursing and damning all terrestrial things, Feeling the persecution and malignity Of providence; but feeling it with dignity, Such as befits a person of his quality, Pursued by a predestinate fatality, But an essential poet in reality. Admitting, therefore, that his lines are grander Than those of Mister Walter Savage Landor, We still maintain that in another sense Our Landor claims a first pre-eminence. I should be sorry to be deemed severe, But Byron was a most licentious peer, Leading, in fact, a dissipated life, Without respect of widow, maid, or wife. While Walter Savage Landor's immorality Is mere imaginary classicality, Wholly devoid of criminal reality. Yet Walter Savage Landor in his way Is often-times unutterably gay. “He frolicketh,” and “doth frolic,” and in fine (Adhering strictly to the classic line With such methodic gambols as become A classic Prig) Landor is frolicsome: Quite a beau garcon, a consummate beau, In the beau-monde two thousand years ago. A perfect master of the savoir vivre. Un homme à bonnes fortunes, a gay deceiver. In his own conduct cautious and correct, But a decided rake in retrospect With classic ardour, rash and uncontrolled, With Lais and with Thais he makes bold, The Harriette Wilsons of the days of old. He loves a tête-a-tête with fair Aspasia, And takes his daily lounge in the gymnasia; But his supreme delight is Alcibiades. A rhyme, I want a rhyme for Alcibiades; There's none that I can think of, none but Pleiades. And a more lucky rhyme I never met! For it suggests a scheme I might forget. One point is settled, that we must not squander, While we possess a Walter Savage Landor, Honour or praise on any man beside; Is he not Europe's wonder? England's pride? Therefore, I say, let every means be tried To immortalize the most immortal man; Let all true Britons do the best they can, Whatever art can do with brass and copper, Canvas and marble, will be just and proper: Whilst we that manufacture prose and verse In humble strains endeavour to disburse Our debt of admiration; and express His high deserts by dint of letter-press;— But all is transitory—prose and verse, Sculpture and painting—Wise astronomers! “In all things I prefer the permanent.” Could you not place our Landor in the firmament? Marble will decompose, and canvas moulder, Before the world is many centuries older Moreover, in all likelihood, God knows! Our compositions, whether verse or prose, Compose them as we may, will decompose: Even great Landor's deathless works may die. Whereas, if you could place him in the sky, Nothing that happened here need signify. There he might shine in spite of the ravages And devastations of invading savages, Tranquil and bright; whilst a benighted age Profaned in filthy sort his mighty page. Surely with all your curious observation You might detect a vacant constellation; Or make another new one here or there, Just as you did with Berenice's hair. Pope asked the question once, and so shall I! “Is there no bright reversion in the sky?” No reserved district? Nothing unallotted? Were all your predecessors so besotted As to grant out a total hemisphere Assigned to the first claimants that appear (Like that proud Pontiff the sixth Alexander.) Is nothing left for Walter Savage Landor? I should not wish for our heraldic scion To stand a whole-length figure like Orion, Perseus, and other astronomic giants; I merely think that by the kind compliance, Favour and aid of an illustrious science, Somewhere or other in the bounds of space His glorious inkstand might obtain a place. See what a list of articles appear Established in the southern hemisphere; Their own chronometers and telescopes Canonized by your astronomic Popes! With other objects that still less concern us, A painter's easel, and a chemist's furnace, A sculptor's tools and workshop in a lot, A microscope, an air-pump, and what not, And, oh! shall Landor's Inkstand be forgot. For Landor “scrawls not upon greasy platters,” Nor such like sordid sublunary matters; His paper and his ink are transcendental, Warranted sempiternal, elemental, His patent right in ink is a good rental, His affidavit states that the true article Does not contain a perishable particle. P.S. and N. B. A necessary caution to the buyer— Counterfeits are abroad—please to enquire For packets sealed and signed, “Landor, Esquire.” The Aeidian fluid, ink of immortality, The rest are frauds of an inferior quality. P.S. On second thoughts, “I must recall my groom, And add a postscript, tho' for want of room It must be short—a warning was omitted Which to the sons of science is submitted. My dear Astronomers! you must be sensible That caution in this case is indispensable; —I feel I must confess—my doubts and fears, From Landor's exaltation to the spheres. Let it be done with care and circumspection; And don't proclaim a general election Of candidates for the new constellation, Or every star will hurry from his station: The least of them that feels the least ambition To change his place and better his condition Will bustle and start forth in the confusion Of a chaotic general dissolution,— Depend upon it, we shall hear the sky. Re-echoing with an universal cry, “Place us in Landor's inkstand or we die. “—Yes, welcome chaos! if we can attain “That high distinction, let it come again. MODERN IMPROVEMENTS. The cumbrous pollards that o'ershade, Those uplands rough with brakes and thorns, The green way with its track-worn glade The solitary grange forlorn, The lonely pastures wild and drear The lonely dwellings wide apart, Are whispering to the fancy's ear A secret strain that moves the heart. No forms of grandeur or of grace, In the rude landscape you behold, But their rough lineaments retrace The features of the times of old: They speak of customs long retained Of simple, plain, primeval life, They mark the little we have gained, With all our study, toil and strife; Such England was to Shakespeare's eyes, So Chaucer viewed her as he roved, In russet weeds of rustic guise, In homelier beauty more beloved. Our ancient halls have left the land, Turrets and towers have passed away, Arcades and porticoes were planned And these again have had their day: Impatient, peevish wealth recalls The forms which she defaced before, Unthrifty sires destroyed the halls, Which modern prodigals restore; Confounding England, Rome, and Greece, Our antient and our modern grace, We dislocate with wild caprice All unities of time and place; Yet here attended by the Muse Let harassed Fancy pause awhile And unpolluted yet peruse This remnant of our ancient isle. JOURNEY TO HARDINGHAM TO VISIT THE REV. W. WHITER, OF CLARE HALL. The rude South-wester from his den Comes raving o'er a range of fen; The window frame of massy cast, Unhinged, unpullied, never fast, Trembles and jostles to the blast: The drops still standing on the pane, The shivering twigs that drip with rain, The prospect of the distant plain, Obscure and undistinguish'd furnish No motive for cross country journeys. Besides—with waiting for the post— The morning is already lost. While Reason pauses to decide, Let Fancy paint the future ride. From famed Winfarthing's lonely pound To Buckenham's huge mysterious mound, How dull and dismal is the scene— Dreary, monotonous, and mean. Its ancient Common, wide and bare, Dissected into straight and square, How cheerless and devoid of grace! With painful interrupted pace, The drooping Peasantry retire Stumbling and staggering thro' the mire: From scattered huts the transient rays Betray their frugal evening blaze; The wintry sun's descending beam, With chilly melancholy gleam, Reflected from the stagnant drains Illuminates those endless lanes: Such scenes absorb my thoughts and bring 'em, Prepared with joy to enter Hingham; Her stately steeple strikes the sight, And cheerful sounds and lively light, My past antipathies requite; Again, afraid to miss the mark, I plunge thro' turnings close and dark, Immerging among trackless acres I hope to light upon the Quakers. The Quakers—sure it must be so— The stream lies glimmering there below, Look on—the steeple stands in view— The parsonage and the steeple too— The clattering gate returning hard, Announces guests within the yard; I see the worthy priest rejoice— With open face and hearty voice, His old acquaintance kindly hailing, With hand outstretched across the paling. Alighting now, we pass the hall And view the parlour snug and small, The fire of logs, the tapestry wall; Huge volumes prostrate on the floor; A parsonage of the days of yore. Our dinner ended, we discourse Of old traditions and their source, Of times beyond the reach of history, Of many a mythologic mystery, Of primitive records and acts, Their traces and surviving facts, Of tribes, of languages, and nations, Of immemorial old migrations; Hence our digressive chat enquires Of justices, divines, and squires, Of births, and marriages, and deaths, Enclosures of the neighbouring heaths, Of ancient friends at Caius and King's. And such like sublunary things. Again—we soar to the sublime, On pinions of recited rhyme, While you persuade me to proceed With “Well,” or “Very well, indeed!” A long continued recitation, Epistle, fable, or translation, Exhausting all my last year's stock, Conducts us on to twelve o'clock. So be it then—In spite of weather, I'll take the good and bad together; So George put up of shirts a pair, And bid them saddle me the mare. IMITATION OF HORACE, LIB. I. EP. XI. Quid tibi visa Chios, etc. Dear Bartle, How does Turkey suit your taste, Compared with it is Lisbon quite effaced, Seville, and all the scenes we viewed together, What sort of climate have you found, and weather? The fish, the figs, the grapes, and Grecian wine, In real earnest, are they quite as fine As modern travellers have represented? Inform us—are you joyous and contented, Or are you sick of Dragomans and Turks, Muftis, Bashaws, and all their wicked works? And pine to visit our domestic scene, Roydon and Finningham, and Mellis' Green, To pass a rainy winter afternoon With Mr. Mrs. and the Misses Moon, Till, like an affable convivial priest, Returning late from his parochial feast, Temple diverts us from backgammon playing, With phrases of old Daniel Garrard's saying. Next morning we must saunter out once more To view the scenes so often viewed before. The solemn feature and commanding stare Of antient-justices and ladies fair, Which Rednall still preserves with loyal care, Arranged in order round his parlour wall, Poor emigrants from the deserted hall; Or prune with grave discussion and suspense The rising saplings in the new-made fence; Or wander forth where Syret's wife deplores The broken pantiles in her pantry floors; Or eastward pass to that remoter scene Where tracts of hostile acres intervene, To look at Kersey's maid, and taste his ale, And grieve to see the new-made plaister fail. Then to return, and find at every station Old topics, that revive the conversation, Themes of complacency and consolation. “That stream with proper care might overflow “The strip of pasture ground that lies below; “Those trees have of themselves contrived to grow; “Those ancient chimneys have been well replaced,” And “Temple's chancel has been tiled with taste.” Such joys as these attend on my return To Roydon, from the place of date—Eastbourne. August 23, 1812. FRAGMENT. Is the dominion of an abstract rule Restricted to the Geometric School, To be recognized there, and there alone, Shall we conclude of sciences unknown Analogy forbids it. What is true In an established science, in a new May be true likewise. Her reply would say, “Must—absolutely must—not only may— “But struggle for yourselves, I point the way.” And what say we? shall our familiar guide Hear her instructions scoffed at, and denied? Good old analogy that first supplied Our infant world with elemental speech! She, that in daily life descends to teach With nature at her side, adult, and grown And wise in an experience of our own, What nature dictates, and analogy, Shall we with peremptory pride deny? Or shall we follow where she points the way, A path of steep ascent and hard assay, Yet leading to a summit clear and high, Of boundless vision, in a cloudless sky, Where nature's mighty landscape, unsurveyed By mortal eye, lies open and displayed. The Ideal ruling law, like words to deeds, In numbers and geometry, precedes The Concrete, Thought is there the lord and king, The sov'reign; the mechanic subject thing Is substance, practice, and experiment; And shall we deem, that intellect was lent To light a single science? Have the rest Lost their high caste, degraded and deprest Irrevocably: doomed to labour here For fame and gain, in an inferior sphere, Surveyor, architect, or engineer? Is there no spirit of a loftier strain, A Kepler or a Newton once again, With light upon the chaos, to divide, And fix the mass of knowledge dark and wide, With a divining hand, to seize the clue, To keep the known conclusion full in view, And work the problem till he proves it true? Must we for ever shrewd and worldly wise, Confine ourselves to Solomon's advice, To seek enjoyment, and escape from want, To take our pattern from the labouring ant, Where imitative nature emulates The forms of understanding, and creates Devoid of intellect, her pigmy states, A single soul in sundry forms combined, A patriotic universal mind, An instrumental nature, ever striving For a fixt purpose, labouring and contriving, United, orderly, coherent, still Without a selfish aim or separate will, With nothing individual? Which is he, The legislator master of the free, The great preceptor, teaching from his tomb A living multitude, that shall presume To place his model for the rule of man, In parallel with this, the simple plan Fixed and ordained for an inferior state, Penultimate of man's penultimate? With righteous or perverted will to take Good simply as good—evil for evil's sake; Mischief in children—bold debauch in men Exulting and approved—the pimping pen That seeks to pander for a race unborn, The unholy league that pours contempt and scorn On every better purpose, industry Perverse and servile, that descends to pry In crevices of forgotten infamy, With unrewarded toil, to canonize The rakes and drabs of former centuries, Their relics and remains. These and a thousand other signs reveal The existence of a pure unpurchased zeal, Zeal in the cause of evil, that divests The obedient mind of selfish interests, And ranks them in the legendary list, The martyrs of the great antagonist. Enough of Evil—for the bve of good Misconstrued, scandalized, misunderstood, Denied and hated—still that it exists I feel and know—Deny it he that lists— But grant it—and gou see human will Working in eager chase of good or ill. These rudiments of an ulterior state Embarrass and bewilder with debate Our human hive and ant-hill—as the wings Unfledged, are cumbrous and contentious things To callow birds (that struggle in the nest Naked and crowded) useless at the best. FRAGMENT. II. The revelation of an element, Its accidents and forms—What else is meant By that established phrase, “the visible world?” What but a single element unfurled And manifested to a single sense? Is tangible creation more immense, More multiform than the domain of Light, That visible creation which the sight Holds as its empire through the ministry Of light, its elemental sole ally? The Almighty Wisdom and Power that could direct, And with a single element effect So vast a purpose, shall we dare deny (What reason teaches and analogy) That the same Wisdom and Power, working his will With the like simple means, with the same skill, In a like form and method might devise All that a grosser sense can recognize? No! the celestial Author and Creator In those two volumes of the Book of Nature Ordained for our instruction, represents, By multiform but single elements, One universe of sense, all that we know, The visible world of instantaneous show And tangible creation, hard and slow, The last remaining inlet of the mind, The dreary blank creation of the blind. Nor is it vain what elder bards indite Of Love self-born, and by inherent might Emerged from chaos and primeval night. Was this the form, which idle fancy sings, With glowing cheeks adorned and glittering wings, The classic idol and the modern toy, A torch, a quiver, and a blinded boy? Was this the sense? or does it represent Some sovereign and controlling element, Some impulse unapproachable by thought, Some force that 'midst the eternal tumult wrought, And this fair order from confusion brought; Established motion's substance, form, and weight, The statutes of this earth's material state? —Suppose a single element the source Of all attractive and impelling force, That motion and cohesion are the extreme United opposites upon the beam Of Nature's balance, a magnetic whole, Single itself, and one; but pole to pole Contrasted; as the powers of heat and light Stand each confronted with its opposite Darkness and cold; not mere negations they, But negatives with a divided sway, Pressing—oppressed—advancing—giving way. Suppose then (as has been supposed before By wisest men) that in the days of yore There was a deeper knowledge, and a store Of science more exalted and sublime, Whose relics on the barren shore of time Lie stranded and dispersed, retaining still Intelligible marks of art and skill, Of an intended purpose and appliance, The scanty salvage of a shipwrecked science Submerged time out of mind! Kepler could draw From these remains the mighty truth he saw Of an harmonic, necessary law; Then with an indefatigable mind Analogies incessantly combined With a foreseen conclusion full in view He worked the problem till he proved it true. Is there no spirit of a nobler strain, A Kepler or a Newton once again, With light upon the chaos to divide, And fix the mass of knowledge waste and wide; For as “the crowd of trees conceals the wood,” With all things known, with nothing understood, Perplexed with new results from year to year, As on the puzzled Ptolemaic sphere With cycles epicycles scribbled o'er, Like ancient Philomaths we doze and pore: Thus Ashmole, Lilly, shine in portraiture (Dear to the calcographic connoisseur); While the wise nightcap and the Jacob's staff Awe the beholder and conceal his laugh. —If we despair then to decypher nature With our new facts and novel nomenclature: Those almanacks of science that appear Framed and adjusted for the current year, And warranted correct for months to come; If calculation fails to find the sum (A formula to comprehend the whole) Of countless items on the crowded scroll, Corrected, re-corrected, and replaced, Obliterated, interlined, effaced, Blotted and torn in philosophic squabble, And endless, unintelligible scrabble; If the huge labyrinth with its winding ways Entangled in the inextricable maze, The wilderness of waste experiment, Has foiled your weary spirits worn and spent, Since every path is trodden round and tried, —Trust for a moment a superior guide; The trembling needle or the stedfast star, Some point of lofty mark and distant far, These shall conduct you, whatsoe'er your fate, At least in a decided path and strait; Not running round in circles, evermore Bewildered and bewitched as heretofore: Like the poor clown that robbed the wizard's store Breathless and hurrying in his endless race, With eager action, and a ghastly face, By subtle magic tether'd to the place. Yet let us hope that something may befall! That things will find their level after all! That these atomic facts, ever at war, Tumbled together in perpetual jar, After a certain period more or less Will ultimately form or coalesce. So shall it be! Strife shall engender motion, And kindle into life each tardy notion. Keen disputants in a judicial fight, Sparring with spurs of controversial spite, In battle-royal shall decide the right. Till truth's majestic image stands revealed The sole surviving game-cock in the field! —That venerable, old, reviewing phrase, Threadbare and overworn—mark what it says The fashionable tenet of the time, Tho' stale in prose, it may be hashed in rhyme. —When disputants, it says, with hasty zeal Clash in hard discord like the flint and steel, The sparks elided from their angry knocks, Caught in a philosophic tinder-box, Falling upon materials cut and dried, With modest brimstone diligently ply'd, And urged with puffs incessantly supplied, As an atonement for the noise and scandal, Will serve to light a scientific candle. —But no!—the wrath of man never attains To pure results, nor his ambitious pains, Nor busy canvas, nor a learned league, (Except in undermining and intrigue;) In lonely shades those miracles of thought Are brought to light. No miracles are wrought To gratify the scruples or the whim Of a contentious testy Sanhedrim. “To satisfy just doubts,” “to guide decision,” For no such purposes, the mighty vision Was ever yet vouchsaf'd sudden and bright, Descending in a soft illapse of light. Quenching its murky steam of filthy vapour, It kindles at a touch the fumy taper. Let, then, a new progressive step be tried, Since light and heat, it is not now denied, Are agents, consubstantial and allied. Now for this other power, which we must call (Taking a single quality for all) Attraction, or the power of gravity, The power of motion, form, solidity, Third person of the Pagan Trinity. This power, then, of attraction, truly viewed, Displays a likeness and similitude With light, as a congenial kindred force; For common reason will concede, of course, That all attractive forces great and small Are retroactive and reciprocal; As when the mariners with trampling feet, In even cadence round the capstan beat, Moving in order round the mighty beam, To warp their vessel against wind and stream, While the huge cable, with its dripping fold, In weary coils incessantly enrolled, Drags forth the labouring vessel to the deep. The point, then, we have conquer'd, and can keep: As being drawn itself, the cable draws, Tho' passive, it becomes a moving cause. Take then at once the reason and the facts, Light is attracted, therefore light attracts— And though the nobler attributes of light Have left this incident unnoticed quite, And tho' we find its feebler efforts fail, Of marked effect on a material scale, Unheeded and impalpable to sense, Yet reason must acknowledge its pretence Enough to range it in a kindred class Tho' inefficient on the subject mass. The facts and inferences fairly viewed, With this result we finally conclude— If ever Reason justly gave assent To truths too subtle for experiment, Then light is an attracting element, And heat, its congener, will be the same, A joint supporter of this worldly frame. Nor these alone—but that attractive force Described in the first lines of our discourse, Whose nature and existence known of yore Was but a portion of the secret store Of Eastern learning, which the busy Greek, Active and eager, started forth to seek, Purchasing here and there a wealthy prize, Amidst the ruins of the rich and wise, The mighty sacerdotal monarchies, Stupendous Egypt—Stately Babylon By the barbarian Persian overthrown. (The Chivalrous Barbarian in his line, A gallant loyal warrior, but in fine A fierce Iconoclastic Ghibelline!) Such is the fact—our first historic page —Herodotus—begins with a dark age, An age of antient Empires overturned, Records obliterated, temples burned, Their living archives, all the learned class, Methodically murder'd in a mass. Hence like a sutler at a city's sack, The wary Grecian pedlar filled his pack, And cannily contrived to bring it back With merchandize: such as a pedlar gets, Remnants and damaged samples, broken sets, Fragments of plunder, purchased or purloined, Rich fragments but incongruously joined. The scheme of Hutchinson was incomplete, It stands without its complement of feet: A tripod resting upon light and heat His third supporter fails, limping and bare Of evidence, his element of air. His scheme then at the time was doomed to fall, Or left with lumber propt against the wall, A maim'd utensil, destitute of use, Obscure with dust of obsolete abuse— The learned dust excited in the frays Of Jacobite and Hanoverian days. Newton and Cambridge and the Brunswick line, And Dr. Clarke, and Gracious Caroline, Matched against Oxford and the right divine. Whether, in fact, as all opinions mix, They finally converge to politics, Or shrewd intriguers had contrived to fix On their opponents a disloyal stain, Blind to the glories of so bright a Reign, The name with Jacobite opinions link't With Jacobite opinions was extinct: Each cultivated ornamental prig Of hybrid form, a parson and a whig, (A whig by principle or calculation, A Christian Priest by trade and occupation) Each smooth aspirant, loyal and correct, Was bound in policy to shun the sect; While of the sacred bench each righteous son, Clayton and Hoadley, and meek Warburton, Condemned them soul and body, blood and bone! Meanwhile Sir Isaac's theory of attraction, Afforded universal satisfaction; Applauded by the clerical profession As friendly to the Protestant succession; A sober well-affected theory Which none but a nonjuror could deny— A theory may be false or incomplete, While the phenomena and the rules may meet; Conceive (as was imagined formerly) That vision is ejected from the eye —You'll find the rules of perspective apply. We judge from practice the physician's skill, And let him choose what principles he will, Bad theories may cure and good ones kill. First then our drugs and aliments we see, Dry, cold, or hot in some assigned degree: Next mathematic learning came in use, The blood was clogged with particles obtuse: Poisons were points which antidotes must sheath, Mechanic action made us move and breathe: A chemic system rose upon its fall, Acids and alkalis were all in all: A change of argument, a change of style, Mere speculative change, for all the while The same prescriptions rested on the file, And while the verbal argument endured, The patients as before were killed or cured. A theory that enables us to plant A tortoise underneath our elephant, But wants a creature of some other sort, To serve us for our tortoise's support: In other words it teaches us the laws —Of motion and attraction—not the cause. The laws are undisputed, and we see How punctually predicted facts agree; Meanwhile the cause unnoticed or denied Is with a monstrous postulate supplied: First we suppose that our terrestrial ball, Launched forth with an enormous capital Of motion—like a wandering prodigal Without a stipend of in-coming rent, In all his course of travel, has not spent One stiver of the first allotted sum, Nor ever will, for ages yet to come. The quantum still remains as heretofore, An unexhausted, undiminished store, The same precisely, neither less nor more; An article of faith hard to digest, If common sense and nature are the test, Yet proselytes must bolt it, husk and bran, And keep it on their stomachs if they can— —No theory or conjecture, not a notion, Of the first causes of a planet's motion! Whence it originates no creature knows, But with a given impulse forth it goes; Attraction's laws prohibit it to roam, And bind the wand'rer to his central home; Else had the wretched orb been whirl'd away, Far from the stars of night and beams of day, A cheerless, endless, solitary way. Rescued, and grateful for the glad reprieve, It gilds the morn or decks the front of eve, And winds a joyous uneccentric way In the warm precincts of the solar ray: Obedient system clears the bounds of space From all that might retard the yearly race. The same incessant circuit is pursued, With the same force for ages unrenewed, And sages of the sacred gown conclude. That independent of an acting cause, The properties of matters, motions, laws, Preserve the punctual planet in his sphere, Ordain the seasons and bring round the year— See here the lessons reverend gownsmen teach, The proud result of Learning's utmost reach. Since wisest moderns have approved it true, We take it as a fact—Nothing is new. No—not the boast of this new century, Our busy science of geology; The terms of parturition and of birth Express the first development of earth. “This habitable earth, cheerful and fair, “Heaved from the teeming depth to light and air;” This truth which Hutton's school has taught us newly Where do we find it first? In Moses truly! You see the passage paraphrased and quoted, In the two lines above with commas noted, Much weaker than the original. Again— The wisest, in his time, of living men Adopts the same expression, adding more, How the protruded mountains pierced the core Of secondary strata formed before, Even as a finger passing thro' “a ring,” This truth was known to the “sapient king—” See Proverbs, chapter eight, verse twenty-five, And try what other meaning you can give; Or take the converse; to characterise The sense proposed, and frame it otherwise, In Hebrew words, clearer and more precise; And we shall hail you when the task is done A better scholar than King Solomon— —The Hetrurian priesthood knew the identity Of lightning and of electricity. Discovery or tradition!—Such things were Sources of hidden knowledge, deep and rare, Before the days of Franklin and Voltaire, (In the good days of old idolatry, And priestcraft! undisturbed by blasphemy) —Or tell me! By what strange coincidence Is the same word employed in the same sense, A single word that serves to signify The electric substance and the Deity Of storms and lightning; (their Elician Jove) Whom with due rites invoked from the dark clouds above, The priest attracted downwards! woe betide The novice that presumptuously tried, Ignorant of the ritual and the form, To dally with the Deity of the storm; Like the rash Roman king, by the dread stroke, Which his unpractised art dared to provoke, Smitten and slain; a just example made For ancient sovereigns who might dare to invade, And tamper with the sacerdotal trade. In the vast depths of ocean far below, Where neither storms disturb nor currents flow, Fish would remain unconscious of the water: And reason, if experience had not taught her By the rude impulse of the changeful wind, Mere common understanding would not find, That air existed—Nothing here below, Unless it can be felt or make a show, Is marked or heeded, nothing else we know. If light were universally displayed Without its opposites, darkness and shade, Constant and uniform in operation, It never would attract our observation. Suppose the case, and that it were denied That light existed—how could we decide, Or judge the question by what test applied? Strong Reason and superior Art perhaps, Long labouring in a long continued lapse Of ages, might at length attain to show What infants from their first impression know: —“Ever the same yesterday and to-day;” Powers that exhibit no phenomena, (No signs of life in change or difference) To the mere understanding and the sense, Are non-existencies; but here again, Can our acknowledged principles explain All our acknowledged facts? Do none remain? When causes are assigned to their effects, Will there be no Lacuna, no defects, Nothing anomalous or unexplained? I doubt it—otherwise the point is gained; The point, I presuppose, that there exists An unacknowledged power, that as it lists Rules paramount in its domain of air, Guiding its endless eddies here and there: But whither or from whence the currents flow, Their source or end our senses cannot show, And science never has attained to know. Darwin has sung in verse beyond compare, That in the North, beneath the Frozen Bear, A huge chamelion spits and swallows air. In fact, an instantaneous formation, And a precipitous annihilation Of our aerial fluid seems implied In facts not yet developed or denied. As in a whirlpool's strife the waters flow, Pressing in eager eddies as they go Precipitously to the void below, In their own giddy circle wheeled and held By mutual haste impelling and impell'd: With a like action airy currents move To some unseen and hasty void above. Now mark a strong coincidence!—Compare The whirlpool's centre with its spire of air Drawn downwards; and behold the waters move From the smooth ocean's surface rear'd above In fluid spires! Phenomena like these, The careless seaman, in the summer seas, Views unalarmed, the momentary play Of nature's power, an innocent display. But what a power is here! how little known, That not beneath the Frozen north alone, As Darwin deemed, but in the sultry zone Exists and acts—an atmosphere destroyed, And the creation of an instant void! What other explanation can be found? You see the watery columns whirling round, They rise and move while Gravitation's laws Are modified by a suspending clause— In fine, if all our explanations fail, When neither reason nor research avail To solve the difficulty, this remains The fair result and guerdon of our pains— That ex absurdo thus it might be shown That Gravity has phenomena of its own. Thus far, at least, we might presume to say— Here is a power without phenomena, And the phenomena of a power unknown, If both can be combined and brought in one We gain a point, and something may be done. The mere suggestion sure may be permitted: No damage is incurred, no harm committed, If not, they both remain on their own score Obscure and unconnected as before. Now then, resuming what before was stated, We seek to show the converse: Air created, And a continued efflux generated, Where seamen witness in a cloudless sky A driving hurricane eager and dry, Continuous fury—without pause or shift Its unappeasable, impetuous drift Scourges and harasses the main for hours, For days, for weeks, with unabated powers, The Spirit of the Tempest hurries by, With hideous impulse, and a piercing cry, A persevering wild monotony. Shorn of her topmast, all her goodly pride And rich attire of canvas stript aside; In a bare staysail, with an abject mien, The vessel labours in the deep ravine, A watery vale that intercepts the sight, Or in an instant hurried to the height, Pauses upon the fluid precipice, Then downward to the dark and deep abyss Shoots forth afresh, and with a plunging shock Achieves the leap of her Tarpeian rock. Her joints of massy frame compactly clenched With the tormenting strain, are racked and wrenched; The baffled mariners, forlorn and pale, Beneath eternal buffet droop and fail. —Yet strange it seems the while! no signs are given Betokening hope or fear—no vapour driven In quick career across the void of Heaven! Tranquil and calm and blank, the mighty space Wears an unconscious and unruffled face Impassive in sublimity serene, Mocking our toil, smiling upon the scene! And yet the strong commotion was foretold, (The sign Archilochus beheld of old) The crooked, wicked cloud that, creeping slow Around the distant mountain's haughty brow, Folded its angry wreath, settled and fixed, Coiled in itself, unmoving and unmixed, —A talismanic atmospheric spell— The wary seaman knew the signal well; The seal of wrath: and from the token drew A timely warning, terrible but true— —Will the known principles of any school, Will hydrostatic laws, or those which rule The motions of elastic fluids guide Our judgment, or assist us to decide On facts like these? Alas! when all is said, We seek a living power among the dead, And struggle to draw water in a sieve. The cause of such effects must act and live, Subsisting as a separate element, Not as a mere result and accident A simple passive thing urged or controuled By change of cold to heat, or heat to cold, The vassal of a fickle temperature, But a distinct and active power of nature. TO A LADY WITH A PRESENT OF A WALKING STICK. A compliment upon a crutch Does not appear to promise much; A theme no lover ever chose For writing billet-doux in prose, Or for an amatory sonnet; But thus I may comment upon it. Its heart is whole, its head is bright, 'Tis smooth and yielding, yet upright. In this you see an emblem of the donor, Clear and unblemished as his honor, Formed for your use, framed to your hand, Obedient to your least command. Its proper place is by your side, Its main utility and pride To be your prop, support, and guide. LINES ON ED. NUCELLA, ESQ., ÆT. 75. DANCES; GOES LONG JOURNEYS; AND WALKS SIX MILES AN HOUR FOR TWO HOURS DAILY. See the spirit and the vigour Of an aged hearty figure, Fit to dance and fit to sing, Fit for any kind of thing, To be sober, to be sad, To be merry, to be mad; Never weary or afraid, Undejected, undismayed, With a manner and a tone, A demeanour of his own, Like a former age reviving, Lingering among the living. 1833. WRITTEN IN THE FLY-LEAF OF MR. POLLOK'S POEM, “THE COURSE OF TIME.” Robert Pollok, A.M! this work of yours Is meant, I do not doubt, extremely well, And the design I deem most laudable, But since I find the book laid on my table, I shall presume (with the fair owner's leave) To note a single slight deficiency: I mean, in short (since it is called a poem), That in the course of ten successive books If something in the shape of poetry Were to be met with, we should like it better; But nothing of the kind is to be found, Nothing, alas! but words of the olden time, Quaint and uncouth, contorted phrase and queer, With the familiar language that befits Tea-drinking parties most unmeetly matched. 1832. SPAIN. Alas, alas! for the fair land of Spain, That noble and haughty nation, whose domain, Stretched from the rising to the setting sun, Are not her judgments even now begun? Is she not marked and sealed, stamped with the stain Of unrelenting fiery persecution? And this the final hour of retribution Fallen upon her? her that we beheld Roused into wrath unquenchable, unquelled, Disarmed and circumvented and betrayed With an unanimous outbreak undismayed, Daring him single-handed to the fight, The fiend whose recreation and delight Was massacre in masses; at whose word The multitudinous European herd, A meaner Race, Politic and refined, sordid and base, Enlightened, scientific, and polite, Courts, cabinets, and camps crouched in affright, Nor was their cumbrous and unwieldy strength Roused by the fierce example, till at length They saw the new Sennacherib down cast, Smitten and withered in the wintry blast With all his legions: then the cry went forth Summoning to the field the people north, Swarming in arms, and the quick life and soul That had excited Spain inspired the whole. Then warfare in another form was seen, The strenuous effort—the people's strife, And the tremendous tactical machine, Moved on its mighty wheels instinct with life. Malta, 1844. HEXAMETERS. Malta, sovereign isle, the destined seat and asylum Of chivalry, honour, and arms—the nursing mother of heroes, Mirror of ancient days, monumental trophy recording All that of old was felt, or feared, or achieved, or attempted, When proud Europe's strength, restored with the slumber of ages, Roused and awoke to behold the triumphant impious empire Throned in the East, and vaunting aloud with lordly defiance; When from the Euxine shore to the Caspian and to the southern Vast Erythrean main to the Gulfs of Ophir and Ormus, Lydia Syrian Sion and all the dominion eastward, Which the old Assyrian controlled to the bounds of Imaus, Bowed to the Sultan's yoke: when slavery bitter and hopeless, Hopeless and helpless, oppressed the dejected lowly believers. Thence to the setting sun, where Mauritanian Atlas, Chilled with eternal snows in a boundless cheerless horizon, Views the deserted plain where Carthage, briefly triumphant, (Africa's only boast, the rival of Italy, Carthage,) Claimed for a while to command the subject world, and accomplish'd That which destiny doom'd—her dark oblivion's annals Torn and blotted in hate; her policy, valour, and ancient Glory reduced to a scoff; with a proverb left to the pedant, Thence enslaved and adorn'd with the toys of slavery—temples Palaces, arches, baths—till they, the remorseless, apostate Infidel enemy came to avenge that gaudy debasement, Trampling in hate and scorn laws, learning, lazy religion, Luxury, sumptuous art, antiquity. Woe to the vanquish'd! Woe to the fields of Spain, to the towers of lordly Toledo, Wealthy Valencia, proud Castile, and stately Granada! Woe to the Gascon tribes, to the mountain glens, to the lonely Pyrenean abodes, to the herdsman and hunter and hermit; Even amidst your shades, your woody recesses, and inmost Rocky ravines, shall the armed tide with hideous impulse Rise and inundate all, pouring, precipitous, headlong, Forth to the fields of France. THE BUBBLE YEAR. Might we not hope, with humble confidence, That finally a benignant Providence Will extricate the British nation From her embarrassed situation, And graciously dispense An earthquake or a pestilence. An earthquake would be far the best, To set the question once for all, at rest; Sinking the sister isle At least a statute mile, With a low, subsiding motion, Beneath the level of the German Ocean, There to suffer a sea change, Into something queer and strange: Then if their “bones are coral made.” They may supply the British trade With an important new commodity: Besides, when each Papistic churl Shall have his eye-balls turn'd to pearl, When “those are pearls which were his eyes.” When each invaluable ball Is fish'd to light by British enterprize And British capital, To what a premium will the shares arise. EPITAPH ON LORD LAVINGTON. WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF LADY LAVINGTON. With every part well acted—life enjoyed, And every talent to the last employed, Here Lavington is laid; a people's grief Consigns to memory their regretted chief. That easy vein of unaffected sense, The wit devoid of effort or offence, The cordial welcome and the smile sincere To living memory long shall linger near. Not that they feared those traces to forget, Their ready suffrage paid the general debt, And gave this lasting form to long regret. No, fixt to future years they bid it stand, A record of well exercised command. Strict and exact, though popular and kind, Discordant virtues in a single mind; High principles with easy manners join'd, A courtier's graces, but without his art; A patriot's zeal where faction had no part, And manly virtues in a gentle heart. EPITAPH ON LORD NELSON. The fragile texture of this earthly form, Which Death has stript aside and cast below, Must never more be shaken by the storm, Nor worn with care, nor shatter'd by the foe. At war's grim sacrifice in fire and blood My living presence never must preside; The keen pursuit across the trackless flood My watchful spirit never more must guide. Britons, farewell! Our country's utmost claim, My life, my labours all are past and paid; The tears of vain regret, the toys of fame, Are idle offerings to your champion's shade. This only tribute to my memory give:— In all your struggles, both by land and sea, Let Nelson's name in emulation live, And in the hour of danger think on me. EPITAPH ON THE REV. WALTER WHITER, AUTHOR OF THE “ETYMOLOGICON UNIVERSALE,” ETC. ETC. If, wandering here, the learned or the wise Should wish to view the spot where Whiter lies, Here is his last abode! and close beside The simple dwelling where he lived and died. For forty years an unpromoted priest, In the world's estimate the last and least, By genius and by learning placed above The greedy, noisy, literary drove Immeasurably high. Without a frown, He views the silly press, the busy town, And clouds of blockheads clamouring for renown. The purpose of his life, its end and aim The search of hidden truth; careless of fame, Of empty dignities or dirty pelf, Learning he sought—and loved it for itself. 1834. EPITAPHS ON MR. CANNING. While sister arts in rivalry combine For Canning's honour,—Sculpture and Design, Verse claims her portion; a memorial line Such as he lov'd; and fittest to rehearse His merit and his praises—Truth in verse. The pride of Honor, and the love of Truth, Adorn'd his age, and dignified his youth. Approv'd thro' life, and tried with every test, In power, in favour, in disgrace, confest The first of his coevals, and the best. Unchanged thro' life, from Childhood's early day, Playfully wise, and innocently gay, Ever the same; with wit correctly pure, Reason miraculously premature, Vivid imagination ever new, Decision instantaneously true, A fervid and precipitated power Of hasty thought, atchieving in an hour What tardier wits, with toil of many a day, Polish'd to less perfection by delay. By nature gifted with a power and skill To charm the heart, and subjugate the will: Born with an ancient name of little worth, And disinherited before his birth; A landless Orphan—rank and wealth and pride Were freely rang'd around him; nor denied His clear precedence, and the warrant given Of nobler rank; stamp'd by the hand of Heav'n In every form of genius and of grace, In loftiness of thought, figure and face. Such Canning was: and, half a century past, Such all the world beheld him to the last: Admir'd of all, and by the best approv'd, By those, who best had known him, best belov'd; His Sovereign's support and the people's choice, When Europe's balance trembled on the poise, Call'd to command by their united voice; Fate snatch'd him from the applauding world; the first Omen of Europe's danger, and the worst. ANOTHER ON THE SAME, SHOULD THE FORMER BE CONSIDERED TOO LONG. While sister arts in rivalry combine For Canning's honor,—Sculpture and Design, Verse claims her portion; a memorial line Such as he lov'd; and fittest to rehearse His merit and his praises—Truth in verse. Truth was his idol; and the pride of truth Adorn'd his age, and dignified his youth. Ever the same; with wit correctly pure, Reason miraculously premature, Vivid imagination ever new, Decision instantaneously true. By nature gifted with a power and skill To charm the heart, and subjugate the will, Admir'd of all, and by the best approv'd, By those, who best had known him, best belov'd; His Sovereign's support, and the people's choice, When Europe's balance trembled on the poise, Call'd to command by their united voice: Fate snatch'd him from the applauding world; the first Omen of Europe's danger, and the worst. ANOTHER MORE CONCISE. I was destroyed by Wellington and Grey. They both succeeded. Each has had his day. Both tried to govern, each in his own way; And both repent of it—as well they may! LINES INSCRIBED IN ROYDON CHURCH In Memory of his nephews, Temple and Griffith Frere, the eldest and the youngest son of Temple and Jane Frere. The elder was drowned when saving the life of a fellow student at Trinity College, Cambridge; and the younger died in the fire which consumed the Vicarage House, at Warfield, Berks. A manly tender heart, a form and frame Heroical, the pride of all his race, Their pride and hope in early youth he came An unexpected inmate of the place Ordain'd for all that breathe on earth below. Exempted from the common ills of life, No wearisome disease, painful and slow, No wild excess, nor youthful hasty strife, Consigned him to the tomb. The prompt endeavour Of a kind heart to succour and to save, Darkened our dawn of hope, and closed for ever His rising worth in an untimely grave. Deem them not unprepared, nor overtaken At unawares, whose daily life is pure. God's chosen children never are forsaken: His mercies and his promises are sure. TABLET IN ROYDON CHURCH. Richard Edward Frere, sixth son of Edward and Mary Anne Frere, born at Llanelly, Brecknockshire, 28th February, 1817, died at Rawul Pindee Punjab, 18th November, 1842, Lieùtenant in H.M. 13th Regiment Light Infantry. Heroic England, prodigal of life, Sends forth to distant enterprise and strife Her daring offspring: we must not repine If, from the frozen circle to the line, Our graves lie scattered: and the sole relief For kindred sorrow and parental grief Is, to record upon an empty tomb Honour and worth, and their untimely doom. LINES ON THE DEATH OF RICHARD EDWARD FRERE. WRITTEN FOR A MONUMENT PROPOSED TO BE ERECTED BY HIS BROTHER OFFICERS. In early youth, with a determined heart, I sought to study war's tremendous art; Thence all that studious hours or busy thought, Or rudimental discipline had taught, To the true test of practice was applied, For daily scenes of action proved and tried. In our first enterprize, when Ghuzni fell, I placed our colours on the citadel; Thence other toils and hardships were essayed, An unexampled siege and marches made Twice to Cabool and homewards in a line Of inexpugnable defiles—in fine, We visited again that Indian flood Improvidently passed, and gladly stood In a secure and peaceable domain, When a severer foe, disease and pain, Approach'd, and in that hard assault I fell, A soldier! having served and suffer'd well; My duties all discharged, with a firm mind, Tranquil and pure, and peaceably resigned, My course is closed; and if I leave a name Unregister'd upon the rolls of fame, Still my kind comrades' care may make it known, Recording on a monumental stone A gentle, generous spirit like their own. LINES DESCRIBING THE ALTERED FEELINGS AND CHARACTER OF THE APOSTLES BEFORE AND AFTER THE EFFUSION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. —“And he took?the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him.”—Mark x. 32. Alas, what words are these! we vainly thought When Israel's redemption should be wrought, And David's ancient dynasty restored, That we—the first disciples of the Lord, Whom his own wise and understanding heart Had chosen for himself, and classed apart From the promiscuous giddy multitude, The gazing, empty crowd, fickle and rude, Taught in his secret hours to feel the force And unsuspected depth of his discourse: On whose behalf, vouchsafing to perform His mightiest miracle, he rebuked the storm— On the lone waves, and at the midnight hour That wondrous act of elemental power Was wrought; and the presumptuous challenge given (The challenge to produce a sign from heaven) Was answered—for our comfort and behoof! To fix our faith affording us a proof Of his assured divinity, denied To the demand of Pharisaic pride!— Ordain'd in pairs, on his own errand sent, For works of love and mercy forth we went, When, as our faith availed us, the distrest Were healed, and evil spirits dispossest, And our kind Lord, unused to show concern, Rejoiced in spirit at our glad return. Thus therefore, as distinguish'd and preferr'd To the proud learned and the vulgar herd— —We deem'd that his disciples and his friends Might look in cheerful hope to loftier ends; That when the promised kingdom was his own, With a deputed power, each on his throne, We might preside, sitting in humble state With our great Chief, gravely subordinate. And must it end in this? must we behold The sad result so fatally foretold? Our promised Saviour, our expected King, Reduced to a rejected, abject thing! Must we behold him baffled and defied, Insulted and tormented—crucified? Far other thoughts were ours, of happy days, Of peaceful empire, glory, power, and praise, Of all the nations of the world combined Beneath the rule of an harmonious mind, A divine spirit affable and kind. Must we behold him thus? we that have seen His tender and compassionating mien When witnessing in others the distress Of griefs in daily life lighter and less! All vanishes at once! the long delusion Of our mistaken hopes—fears and confusion Must haunt our future years! where shall we find The firm support of his celestial mind, For exhortation, comfort, or reproof; Dispersed, pursued, and scattered wide aloof Without a master and without a friend, Sinking in shame for his opprobrious end; Outcasts of every synagogue—the scorn Of Jews and heathen—hated and forlorn! Such were the thoughts the poor apostles had, Communing in their hearts, cheerless, and sad, Weakness and faith united! grief and love! Till strengthened by the Spirit from above. “And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.”—Acts ii. 2, 3. The promise is fulfilled; we see and own The force and action of a power unknown. What in a thousand forms our weary mind And feeble spirit, ignorant and blind, In vain imaginings had turn'd and cast, That mighty blessing is conferred at last: (Dimly conceived as an expected good Now thankfully received and understood) That spirit which inures us to behold With a collected mind, tranquil and cold, All that alarmed us or allured of old: Prospective rank and power, the public breath, Censuring or applauding, chains or death; That Spirit which enables us to stand In presence of the rulers of the land, Aweless and unabash'd, with confidence Unshaken, and spontaneous eloquence Infused and prompted at the present hour; Or in the public place with the like power To quell the raving, giddy multitude, Pierced to the quick, dejected, and subdued, With self-conviction of their past offence: Thence eager all with ready penitence, Imploring consolation and advice, Pledged in remorse and shame to pay the price Of their announced redemption; to discard Their former hopes and fears; to disregard Their ancient fixed adherence to the rules Of Pharisaic hypocritic schools, Emancipated from the vulgar awe Of subtle formalists and priestly law. Nor these alone, but other gifts and powers, Our Lord's bequests, are attributes of ours, Authentic warrants of a power Divine Confirmed by many a wonder, many a sign Wrought in His name and in the public view, Proving our faith and testimony true. The beggar crouching at the temple gate, A cripple from the cradle that had sate With hand outstretching and imploring eye, And an unvaried customary cry, Known and habitual to the passers-by; Him (for he saw the power of inward faith Lodged in his heart) Peter accosts and saith— “Of gold or silver or the coin you crave, “Nought we possess—we give you what we have: “Through faith in Christ our Lord, and in His name “Stand forth upon thy feet—cease to be lame.” 'Twas done! (Such miracles are witness'd still Of a free grace adjuring a free will. The cripples rise with an obedient start, With a strong effort and believing heart). The great Apostle, with an outstretch'd hand, Rears and assists, and teaches him to stand, Plying his ignorant unpractised feet: While—not to leave the blessing incomplete, The loved disciple at his other side Attends the novice to support and guide Within the temple, where he never stood, With heart elate, leaping and praising God. Nor are there wanting to the later law Severer signs such as our fathers saw Quelling their rebel hearts with fear and awe: The perjured hypocrite bereft of life, With his prevaricating, sordid wife, Firm and erect in steady perjury They stand, and in the twinkling of an eye Struck by the deadly sentence, there they lie. Such are the powers conferr'd; and for their use Thus gifted and endow'd—can we refuse Danger or toil or pain or hardship? No! With a fix'd faith and purpose forth we go, In face of a vain world, bound to proclaim His mission, and atonement in His name. Secure of our reward, sure to succeed, And well content to suffer and to bleed. Malta, 2nd April, 1840. A FRAGMENT. Our fancies figure a Divinity, Like Fielding's squire, a Mr. Alworthy: Easy, benignant, equitable, kind— A sort of patron, suited to our mind; (A kind of character we should revere For an estated neighbour or a peer); The qualities by fellow mortals praised, Ad infinitum multiplied and raised, Become our graven image in effect By mortal handicraft advanced and deck'd. Imagination, ever poor and blind, Frames its own idol, after its own kind, In its own likeness. We construct on high A mighty form of human quality, And worship the colossal effigy; We puzzle and confuse our puny wits To build an infinite with endless bits As silly children use—we strive to fill A mimic fountain of eternal will, And form a puddle with our idle skill. But deem not of the Deity as is meant In daily phrase—good, wise, omnipotent: No; nor all-wise, all-good; nor hope to span That mighty compass with the speech of man. Not entity, but essence, such is He Beyond all measure, quality, or degree— Power, wisdom, goodness in infinity, In abstract. He, the Centre and the Source Of the attributes of good, which vain discourse Collects, concentrates—and, when all is done, Reflects its idle mirror to the sun. With Him the past abides—the eternal past— The future is fulfill'd—and first and last Stand obvious to the immeasurable sense, Mere digits in the vast circumference. Thro' chinks and crevices we dimly trace Existence in the forms of time and place; Predicamental loopholes, poor and small, That bound our vision through the dungeon-wall: The future, or the present, or the past, The there or here—a simultaneous, vast Infinite omnipresence—First and last Centre in Him, the ineffably sublime, Beyond all thought or language. If a crime— I feel it or I fear it even thus, In words of human usage to discuss The Eternal Essence, and delineate Infinitude—Shall the puny prate Be suffer'd, which would limit and confine, In an imaginary moral line, The compass of eternal power and law? Shall human reason frame a rule to draw Before its puny court the cognizance Of a Divine eternal ordinance With warrants of its own? Not more uncouth The fines or forfeits in a barber's booth, Or regulations in a billiard-room— If quoted and applied to guide the doom Of ermined judges in the learned hall Bent on a serious plea—than those you call Your axioms absolute and general. Or wilt thou call for archives and records, Thy charter of existence, and the words Which qualify the grant—with curious eye Decyphering obsolete eternity? Canst thou peruse the content and declare No covenant exists recited there Of older date? No former forfeit due— Mere affirmation? Can you prove it true? The Apostle shall reply—“Nay, what art thou, “Oh man, that with a bold and hardy brow “Arraign'd, and pleading in thine own defence, “Question and cross-examine Providence? To be considered as a fellow-creature Seems a pretension of a modest nature, But fails you when address'd to the Creator: Justice you call for—justice let it be, Such as inferior life receives from thee: Your justice slays your vermin, and the fly In pity saved, or left to drown or die, Is the true pattern of a sinking spirit, (In thorough parallel) its works and merit, Of equal worth, whatever claims arise Of just demeanour with his fellow flies, Moral effort, or struggling to be free, And to crawl out by mere congruity— Your aidance is gratuitously given; Gratuitously,—like the grace of Heaven. Pietà, November, 1824.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL II FRAGMENTS FROM THEOGNIS. I. Guided and aided by their holy will, Jove and Apollo, may they guard me still, My course of youth in safety to fulfil; Free from all evil, happy with my wealth, In joyous easy years of peace and health. II. My heart exults the lively call obeying, When the shrill merry pipes are sweetly playing: With these to chaunt aloud, or to recite, To carol and carouse, is my delight: Or in a steadfast tone, bolder and higher, To temper with a touch the manly lyre. III. To revel with the pipe, to chaunt and sing, This likewise is a most delightful thing: Give me but ease and pleasure! What care I For reputation or for property? IV. Learning and wealth, the wise and wealthy find Inadequate to satisfy the mind; A craving eagerness remains behind; Something is left, for which we cannot rest; And the last something always seems the best, Something unknown, or something unpossest. V. My thirst was sated at a secret source, I found it clear and limpid; but its course Is alter'd now; polluted and impure! I leave it; and where other springs allure, Shall wander forth; or freely quaff my fill From the loose current of the flowing rill. VI. To prove our gold or silver coarse or fine, Fire is the test; for man the proof is wine: Wine can unravel secrets, and detect And bring to shame the proudest intellect, Hurried and overborne with its effect. VII. My brain grows dizzy, whirl'd and overthrown With wine; my senses are no more my own; The ceiling and the walls are wheeling round. But, let me try!—perhaps my limbs are sound: Let me retire with my remaining sense, For fear of idle language and offence. VIII. Never oblige your company to stay! Never detain a man; nor send away! Nor rouse from his repose, the weary guest, That sinks upon the couch with wine oppress'd! These formal rules enforc'd against the will, Are found offensive. Let the bearer fill Just as we please—freely to drink away; Such merry meetings come not every day. For me—since for to-night my stint is finish'd, Before my common-sense is more diminish'd, I shall retire—(the rule, I think, is right) Not absolutely drunk nor sober quite. For he that drinks beyond the proper point Puts his own sense and judgment out of joint, Talking outrageous, idle, empty stuff; (The mere effect of wine more than enough)— Telling a thousand things, that, on the morrow, He recollects with sober shame and sorrow: At other times, and in his proper nature, An easy, quiet, amiable creature. Now you, Simonides, mind what I say! You chatter in your cups and prate away, Like a poor slave, drunk on a holiday. You never can resolve to leave your liquor; The faster it comes round, you drink the quicker— There's some excuse—“The slave has fill'd the cup “A challenge or a pledge”—you drink it up! “'Tis a libation”—and you're so devout, You can't refuse it! Manly brains and stout Might stand the trial, drinking hard and fast, And keep their sense and judgment to the last. Farewell! be merry! may your hours be spent Without a quarrel or an argument— In inoffensive, easy merriment; Like a good concert keeping time and measure, Such entertainments give the truest pleasure. IX. Kurnus, these lines of mine, let them remain Conceal'd and secret—verse of such a strain Betrays its author—all the world would know it! “This is Theognis, the Megarian poet, “So celebrated and renown'd in Greece!” Yet some there are, forsooth, I cannot please; Nor ever could contrive, with all my skill, To gain the common liking and good will Of these my fellow citizens.—No wonder! Not even He, the God that wields the thunder (The Sovereign all-wise almighty Jove) Can please them with his government above: Some call for rainy weather, some for dry, A discontented and discordant cry Fills all the earth, and reaches to the sky, X. With kine and horses, Kurnus! we proceed By reasonable rules, and choose a breed For profit and increase, at any price; Of a sound stock, without defect or vice. But, in the daily matches that we make, The price is every thing: for money's sake, Men marry: women are in marriage given; The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, May match his offspring with the proudest race: Thus every thing is mix'd, noble and base! If then in outward manner, form, and mind, You find us a degraded, motley kind, Wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain, And to lament the consequence is vain. XI. To rear a child is easy, but to teach Morals and manners, is beyond our reach; To make the foolish wise, the wicked good; That science never yet was understood. The sons of Æsculapius, if their art Could remedy a perverse and wicked heart, Might earn enormous wages! But, in fact, The mind is not compounded and compact Of precept and example; human art In human nature has no share or part: Hatred of vice, the fear of shame and sin Are things of native growth, not grafted in: Else wise and worthy parents might correct In children's hearts each error and defect; Whereas, we see them disappointed still— No scheme nor artifice of human skill Can rectify the passions or the will. XII. Our commonwealth preserves its former frame, Our common people are no more the same. They, that in skins and hides were rudely dress'd, Nor dreamt of law, nor sought to be redress'd By rules of right, but in the days of old Flock'd to the town, like cattle to the fold, Are now the brave and wise. And we, the rest, (Their betters nominally, once the best) Degenerate, debased, timid and mean! Who can endure to witness such a scene? Their easy courtesies, the ready smile, Prompt to deride, to flatter and beguile! Their utter disregard of right or wrong, Of truth or honour! Out of such a throng (For any difficulties, any need, For any bold design or manly deed) Never imagine you can choose a just Or steady friend, or faithful in his trust. But change your habits! let them go their way! Be condescending, affable, and gay! Adopt with every man the style and tone Most courteous and congenial with his own! But in your secret counsels keep aloof From feeble paltry souls that at the proof Of danger or distress are sure to fail; For whose salvation, nothing can avail! XIII. Our state is pregnant; shortly to produce A rude avenger of prolong'd abuse The commons hitherto seem sober-minded, But their superiors are corrupt and blinded. The rule of noble spirits, brave and high, Never endanger'd peace and harmony. The supercilious, arrogant pretence Of feeble minds, weakness and insolence, Justice and truth and law wrested aside By crafty shifts of avarice and pride; These are our ruin, Kurnus!—never dream, (Tranquil and undisturb'd as it may seem) Of future peace or safety to the state; Bloodshed and strife will follow soon or late. Never imagine that a ruin'd land Will trust her destiny to your command To be remodell'd by a single hand. XIV. My friend, I fear it! pride, which overthrew The mighty Centaurs and their hardy crew— Our pride will ruin us, your friends, and you. XV. Pride and oppressive rule destroy'd the state Of the Magnesians—such was Smyrna's fate— Smyrna the rich, and Colophon the great! And ours, my friend, will follow soon or late. XVI. Kurnus, our state is pregnant to produce The avenger of oppression and abuse! The birth (believe me) will not tarry long; For the same course of outrage and of wrong Which ruin'd the Magnesian state of old,— That very same, we witness and behold. XVII. I walk by rule and measure, and incline To neither side, but take an even line; Fix'd in a single purpose and design. With learning's happy gifts to celebrate, To civilize and dignify the State; Not leaguing with the discontented crew, Nor with the proud and arbitrary few. XVIII. That happy man, my friend, was never seen Nor born into the world, whom saucy spleen Forbore to scandalize! I know not, I! What they would have? but whether I comply To join with others in pursuit of ill, Or keep myself aloof, they blame me still. Such is my fortune; never understood, But censur'd by the wicked or the good! My consolation still remains the same; Fools cannot imitate the man they blame. XIX. That happy man, my friend! that has through life Pass'd unobnoxious to reproach or strife Never existed yet; nor ever will! A task there is which Jove could not fulfil,— Infinite power and wisdom, both combin'd, Would not avail to satisfy mankind. XX. The generous and the brave, in common fame, From time to time encounter praise or blame: The vulgar pass unheeded; none escape Scandal or insult in some form or shape. Most fortunate are those, alive or dead, Of whom the least is thought—the least is said. XXI. The worldly-minded and the worldly wise, In ignorance and arrogance, despise All talents and attainments but their own; Wisdom is their's, they think—and their's alone. But no! the lessons of deceit and wrong, In point of fact, are neither hard nor long: And many know them; but a better will, Prohibits some from practising their skill;— Some have a taste for good, and some for ill. XXII. Many true counsels in this breast of mine Lie buried: many a just and fair design, But inefficient, indolent and weak; I know my nature, and forbear to speak. XXIII. Court not a tyrant's favour, nor combine To further his iniquitous design! But, if your faith is pledg'd, though late and loth, If covenants have pass'd between you both, Never assassinate him! keep your oath! But should he still misuse his lawless power, To trample on the people, and devour, Depose or overturn him;—any how! Your oath permits it, and the gods allow. XXIV. I shall not join the funeral train, to go An idle follower in the pomp of woe: For why—no duty binds me? nor would he, Their arbitrary chief, have mourn'd for me. XXV. I envy not these sumptuous obsequies, The stately car, the purple canopies; Much better pleas'd am I, remaining here, With cheaper equipage and better cheer. A couch of thorns, or an embroider'd bed, Are matters of indifference to the dead. XXVI. Easy discourse with steady sense combin'd, Are rare endowments in a single mind. XXVII. No costly sacrifice nor offerings given Can change the purpose of the powers of heaven: Whatever fate ordains, danger or hurt Or death predestin'd, nothing can avert. XXVIII. The sovereign single person—what cares he For love or hate, for friend or enemy? His single purpose is—utility. XXIX. If popular distrust and hate prevail, If saucy mutineers insult and rail, Fret not your eager spirit! take a line Just, sober, and discreet,—the same as mine! XXX. My friend, the feeling you can not correct Will work at last a ruinous effect To disappoint your hopes. You cannot learn To bear unpleasant things with unconcern; Nor work without repugnance or disgust In tasks that ought to be perform'd, and must. XXXI. I care not for a friend that at my board Talks pleasantly: the friend that will afford Faithful assistance with his purse and sword In need or danger, let that friend be mine! Fit for a bold and resolute design; Not for a conversation over wine! XXXII. Let no persuasive art tempt you to place Your confidence in crafty minds and base! How can it answer? Will their help avail When danger presses, and your foes assail? The blessing which the gods in bounty send, Will they consent to share it with a friend? No! To bestrew the waves with scatter'd grain, To cultivate the surface of the main, Is not a task more absolutely vain, Than cultivating such allies as these, Fickle and unproductive as the seas! Such are all baser minds; never at rest, With new demands importunately press'd— A new pretension or a new request; Till, foil'd with a refusal of the last, They disavow their obligations past. But brave and gallant hearts are cheaply gain'd— Faithful adherents, easily retain'd; Men that will never disavow the debt Of gratitude, or cancel or forget. XXXIII. The civil person (he that to your face Professing friendship: in another place Talks in an alter'd tone) is not the man For a determin'd, hearty partisan. Give me the comrade eager to defend, And, in his absence, vindicate a friend! Whose strong attachment will abide the brunt Of bitter altercation, and confront Calumnious outrage with a fierce reproof, Like brethren bred beneath a father's roof: Friends such as these may serve for your behoof. None others.—Mark my words! and let them be Fix'd as a token in your memory For aftertimes,—to make you think of me! XXXIV. Never engage with a poltroon or craven,— Avoid him, Kurnus, as a treach'rous haven! These friends and hearty comrades, as you think, (Ready to join you, when you feast and drink,) These easy friends from difficulty shrink. For a shrewd intellect, the best employ Is to detect a soul of base alloy; No task is harder nor imports so much; Silver or gold, you prove it by the touch; You separate the pure, discard the dross, And disregard the labour and the loss: But a friend's heart, base and adulterate,— A friendly surface with a core of hate! Of all the frauds with which the Fates have curst Our simple easy nature—is the worst: Beyond the rest ruinous in effect; And of all others hardest to detect: For men's and women's hearts you cannot try Beforehand, like the cattle that you buy. Nor human wit nor reason, when you treat For such a purpose, can escape deceit: Fancy betrays us, and assists the cheat. XXXV. Waste not your efforts, struggle not, my friend, Idle and old abuses to defend! Take heed! the very measures that you press, May bring repentance with their own success. XXXVI. Kurnus, proceed like me! Walk not awry! Nor trample on the bounds of property! XXXVII. “Bad company breeds mischief.” Kurnus, you Can prove that ancient proverb to be true In your own instance; you yourself were driven To an unrighteous act, offending Heaven! XXXVIII. At entertainments show yourself discreet: Remember that, amongst the guests you meet, The absent have their friends, and may be told Of rash or idle language which you hold. Learn to endure a jest—you may display Your courage elsewhere, in a better way. XXXIX. Rash, angry words, and spoken out of season, When passion has usurp'd the throne of reason, Have ruin'd many. Passion is unjust, And for an idle, transitory gust Of gratified revenge, dooms us to pay With long repentance at a later day. XL. The gods send Insolence, to lead astray The man whom Fortune and the Fates betray, Predestined to precipitate decay. Wealth nurses Insolence, and wealth, we find, When coupled with a poor and paltry mind, Is evermore with Insolence combined. Never in anger with the meaner sort Be moved to a contemptuous, harsh retort, Deriding their distresses; nor despise, In hasty speech, their wants and miseries. Jove holds the balance, and the gods dispense For all mankind, riches and indigence. XLI. Learn, Kurnus, learn, to bear an easy mind; Accommodate your humour to mankind And human nature—take it as you find! A mixture of ingredients, good or bad, Such are we all, the best that can be had. The best are found defective, and the rest, For common use, are equal to the best. Suppose it had been otherwise decreed— How could the business of the world proceed? Fairly examined, truly understood, No man is wholly bad, nor wholly good, Nor uniformly wise. In every case, Habit and accident, and time, and place Affect us:—'tis the nature of the race! XLII. Join with the world! adopt, with every man, His party views, his temper, and his plan! Strive to avoid offence! study to please! Like the sagacious inmate of the seas, That an accommodating colour brings, Conforming to the rock to which he clings, With every change of place changing his hue— The model for a statesman, such as you! XLIII. Let not a base calumnious pretence, Exaggerating a minute offence, Move you to wrong a friend! If every time Faults in a friend were treated as a crime, Here upon earth, no friendship could have place. But we, the creatures of a faulty race, Amongst ourselves offend and are forgiven:— Vengeance is the prerogative of Heaven. XLIV. A rival or antagonist is hard To be deceived, they stand upon their guard: But an old friend, Kurnus, is unprepared! XLV. That smith, dear Kurnus, shows but little wit, Who forges fetters his own feet to fit. Excuse me, Kurnus; I cannot comply Thus to be yoked in harness;—never try To bind me strictly, with too close a tie. XLVI. No more with empty phrase and speeches fine Seek to delude me—let your heart be mine! Your friendship or your enmity declare In a decided form, open and fair, An enemy disguised, a friend in show!— I like him better, Kurnus, as a foe! XLVII. Yes!—Drench me with invective! not a stain From all that angry deluge will remain! Fair harmless water, dripping from my skin, Will mark no foulness or defect within. As the pure standard gold of ruddy hue, Prov'd by the touchstone, unalloy'd and true, Unstain'd by rust, untarnish'd to the sight; Such, will you find me—solid, pure and bright. XLVIII. Change for the worse is sooner understood, And sooner practis'd, than from bad to good. Do not advise and school me! good, my friend! I'm past the time to learn. I cannot mend. XLIX. You blame me for an error not my own: Dear friend! the fault was yours, and yours alone. L. My mind is in a strange distracted state; Love you, I cannot!—and I cannot hate! 'Tis hard to change habitual good-will, Hard to renounce our better thoughts for ill,— To love without return is harder still. But mark my resolution and protest! Those services, for which you once profess'd A sense of obligation due to me, On my part were gratuitous and free; No task had I, no duty to fulfil, No motive, but a kind and friendly will. Now, like a liberated bird, I fly, That having snapt the noose, ranges on high, Proud of his flight, and viewing in disdain The broken fetter and the baffled swain, And his old haunt, the lowly marshy plain! For you! the secret interested end Of him, your new pretended party friend, Whose instigation moved you to forego Your former friendship, time will shortly shew; Time will unravel all the close design, And mark his merits, as compar'd with mine. LI. You soar aloft, and over land and wave Are borne triumphant on the wings I gave, The swift and mighty wings, music and verse; Your name in easy numbers smooth and terse, Is wafted o'er the world; and heard among At banquetings and feasts, chaunted and sung, Heard and admir'd: the modulated air Of flutes and voices of the young and fair Recite it, and to future times shall tell; When clos'd within the dark sepulchral cell Your form shall moulder, and your empty ghost Wander along the dreary Stygian coast, Yet shall your memory flourish, fresh and young, Recorded and reviv'd on every tongue, In continents and islands, every place That owns the language of the Grecian race! No purchas'd prowess of a racing steed, But the triumphant muse, with airy speed, Shall bear it wide and far, o'er land and main, A glorious and unperishable strain; A mighty prize, gratuitously won, Fix'd as the earth, immortal as the sun! But for all this—no kindness in return! No token of attention or concern! ?offled and scorn'd, you treat me like a child, From day to day, with empty words beguil'd. Remember! common justice, common sense Are the best blessings which the Gods dispense: And each man has his object; all aspire To something which they covet and desire. Like a fair courser, conqueror in the race, Bound to a charioteer sordid and base, I feel it with disdain; and many a day Have long'd to break the curb and burst away. LII. Bad faith hath ruined me; distrust alone Has sav'd a remnant; all the rest is gone To ruin and the dogs! The powers divine, I murmur not against them, nor repine: Mere human violence, rapine and stealth Have brought me down to poverty from wealth. LIII. Learn patience, O my soul! though rack'd and torn With deep distress—bear it!—it must be borne! Your unavailing hopes and vain regret Forget them, or endeavour to forget: Those womanish repinings unrepress'd, Which gratify your foes, serve to molest Your sympathising friends. Learn to endure! And bear calamities you cannot cure; Nor hope to change the laws of destiny By mortal efforts! Vainly would you fly To the remotest margin of the sky, Where ocean meets the firmament; in vain Would you descend beneath, and dive amain, Down to the dreary subterraneous reign. LIV. Entire and perfect happiness is never Vouchsaf'd to man; but nobler minds endeavour To keep their inward sorrows unreveal'd. With meaner spirits nothing is conceal'd: Weak, and unable to conform to fortune, With rude rejoicing or complaint importune, They vent their exultation or distress. Whate'er betides us—grief or happiness— The brave and wise will bear with steady mind, Th' allotment, unforeseen and undefin'd, Of good or evil, which the gods bestow, Promiscuously dealt to man below. LV. O mighty Jove! I wish the powers of heaven Would change their method!—that a rule were given Henceforward, for the wicked and profane To check their high presumption, and restrain Their insolences and their cruelties: Who mock your ordinances, and despise Justice and right;—henceforth should every man, In his own instance, justify the plan Of Providence: and suffer for his crime During his life: or at the very time, With punishment inflicted on the spot; For now, so long retarded or forgot, The retribution ultimately falls Wide of the mark—the vilest criminals Escape uninjur'd; and the sad decree Affects their innocent posterity, (As oftentimes it happens) worthy men, Blameless and inoffensive:—here again The case is hard! where a good citizen, A person of an honourable mind, Religiously devout, faithful and kind, Is doom'd to pay the lamentable score Of guilt accumulated long before— Some wicked ancestor's unholy deed. I wish that it were otherwise decreed! For now we witness wealth and power enjoy'd By wicked doers; and the good destroy'd Quite undeservedly, doom'd to atone In other times, for actions not their own. LVI. Lawful and honest gain, the gift of heaven, Is lasting, and abides where it is given: But where a man, by perjury or by wrong, Rises in riches, though secure and strong In common estimation (though he deem Himself a happy man, and so may seem) Yet the just sentence on his wicked gains Already stands recorded, and remains For execution. Hence, we judge amiss; And the true cause of our mistake is this: The punishment ordain'd by heaven's decree Attaches to the sin, but, as we see In many cases, leaves the sinner free. Death follows, and is faster in his rate: While vengeance travels slowly, speedy fate Arrests the offender at a shorter date. LVII. Blessed, almighty Jove! with deep amaze I view the world; and marvel at thy ways! All our devices, every subtle plan, Each secret act, and all the thoughts of man, Your boundless intellect can comprehend! On your award our destinies depend. How can you reconcile it to your sense Of right and wrong, thus loosely to dispense Your bounties on the wicked and the good? How can your laws be known or understood? When we behold a man faithful and just, Humbly devout, true to his word and trust, Dejected and oppress'd; whilst the profane, And wicked, and unjust, in glory reign, Proudly triumphant, flush'd with power and gain; What inference can human reason draw? How can we guess the secret of thy law, Or choose the path approv'd by power divine? We take, alas, perforce the crooked line, And act unwillingly the baser part, Though loving truth and justice at our heart; For very need reluctantly compell'd To falsify the principles we held; With party factions basely to comply; To flatter, and dissemble, and to lie! Yet He, the truly brave, tried by the test Of sharp misfortune, is approv'd the best; While the soul-searching power of indigence Confounds the weak, and banishes pretence. Fixt in an honourable purpose still, The brave preserve the same unconquer'd will, Indifferent to fortune, good or ill. LVIII. Kurnus, believe it! Fortune, good or ill, No mortal effort, intellect or skill Determine it; but heaven's superior will. We struggle onward, ignorant and blind, For a result unknown and undesign'd; Avoiding seeming ills, misunderstood, Embracing evil as a seeming good; In our own plans unable to detect Their final, unavoidable effect: Tormented with unsatisfied desire, The fortunate to further aims aspire Beyond the bounds of mortal happiness; Restless and wretched in their own success! We strove like children, and the almighty plan Controls the froward children of weak man! LIX. In a frail bark across the seas you come, Poor Clearistus, to my poorer home! Yet shall your needy vessel be supplied With what the Gods in clemency provide: And if a friend be with you, bring him here! With a fair welcome to my simple cheer. I am not yet a niggard, nor by stealth Dissemble the poor remnant of my wealth: Still shall you find a hospitable board, And share in common what my means afford. Then, should enquirers ask my present state, You may reply,—my ruin has been great: Yet, with my means reduc'd, a ruin'd man, I live contented on a humbler plan: Unable now to welcome every guest— But greeting glad and freely, though distress'd, Hereditary friends—of all the best. LX. The yearly summons of the creaking crane, That warns the ploughman to his task again, Strikes to my heart a melancholy strain— When all is lost, and my paternal lands Are till'd for other lords, with other hands, Since that disastrous wretched voyage brought Riches and lands and every thing to nought. LXI. How could I bear it? In the public place To chaunt and revel, when, before my face, Seen in the distance, I discern the train Of harvest-triumph, and the loaded wain And happy labourers with garlands crown'd, Returning from the hereditary ground, No more my own! My faithful Scythian slave! Break off this strain of idle mirth, and shave Your flowing locks, and breathe another tone Of sorrow for my fair possessions gone! LXII. Elate with wine, my losses I despise, And rude attacks of railing enemies. But youth departing, and remember'd years Of early mirth and joy, move me to tears; While, in the dreary future, I behold The dark approach of age, cheerless and cold. LXIII. Simonides! if with my learning's store I still retained my riches as before, I should not shrink from joining as a guest In converse with the wisest and the best. But now, with idle shame opprest and weak, I sit dejected, and forbear to speak; Feeble, forgetful, melancholy, slow, My former pride of learning I forego, My former knowledge I no longer know. Such is our state! in a tempestuous sea, With all the crew raging in mutiny! No duty follow'd, none to reef a sail, To work the vessel, or to pump or bale; All is abandon'd, and, without a check, The mighty sea comes sweeping o'er the deck; Our steersman, hitherto so bold and steady, Active and able, is deposed already: No discipline, no sense of order felt, The daily messes are unduly dealt; The goods are plunder'd; those that ought to keep Strict watch are idly skulking or asleep; All that is left of order or command Committed wholly to the basest hand. In such a case, my friend, I needs must think It were no marvel though the vessel sink. This riddle to my worthy friends I tell, But a shrewd knave will understand it well. LXIV. Schemes unadvisable and out of reason Are best adjourn'd—wait for a proper season! Time and a fair conjuncture govern all. Hasty ambition hurries to a fall, A fall predestin'd and ordain'd by heaven: By a judicial blindness madly driven, Mistaking and confounding good and evil, Men lose their senses as they leave their level. LXV. Stir not a step! risk nothing! but believe That vows and oaths are snares, meant to deceive! Jove is no warrant for a promise given,— Not Jove himself, nor all the gods in heaven. Nothing is safe, no character secure, No conduct, the most innocent and pure: All are corrupt, the commons and the great, Alike incapable to save the state. The ruin of the noblest and the best Serves for an idle ballad or a jest. Shame is abolish'd, and in high command, Rage, impudence, and rapine rule the land. LXVI. A trusty partizan, faithful and bold, Is worth his weight in silver or in gold For times of trouble; but the race is rare,— Steady, determin'd men, ready to share Good or ill fortune! Such, if such there are, Could you survey the world, and search it round, And bring together all that could be found, The largest company you could enrol, A single vessel would embark the whole! So few there are! the noble, manly minds, Faithful and firm, the men that honour binds, Impregnable to danger and to pain, And low seduction in the shape of gain. LXVII. Lash your obedient rabble! lash and load The burden on their backs! spurn them and goad! They'll bear it all; by practice and by birth The most submissive humble slaves on earth! LXVIII. Friend! if your sense and judgment had been wholly, Or nearly equal to your pride and folly, You might have seen yourself approv'd and priz'd As much precisely as you're now despis'd. LXIX. Scarce can I venture plainly to declare Our present state, or what the dangers are. Let the worst happen! I shall bear, I trust, Whatever fate determines—bear we must! Inextricable difficulties rise, And death and danger are before our eyes. LXX. From many a friend you must withhold your plans! No man is safe with many partizans, No secret! With a party sure, but small, Of bold adherents, trusty men withal, You may succeed; else ruin must ensue, Inevitable, for your friends and you. LXXI. Kurnus! since here we meet friends and allies, We must consult in common, to devise A speedy remedy with brief debate, To meet the new disorders of the state. More practice is requir'd, and deeper skill, To cure a patient than to make him ill. The wise in easy times will gladly rest; When things are at the worst a change is best. Kurnus! in power and honour, heretofore, Your former fortunes you discreetly bore. Fortune has alter'd! bear it calmly still, Endeavouring, with a firm and steady will, With other changes, our affairs to mend, With a bold effort, and with heaven to friend. If, Kurnus, our support has been displaced, Our main defence dismantled and defaced, Must we, like cowards, of all hope forsaken, Lament and howl, as if the town were taken? Though now reduced, no more a numerous host, Courage, and sense, and honour are our boast. Danger and hope are over-ruling powers Of equal influence, and both are ours! Where counsel and deliberation fail, Action and strenuous effort may prevail. My spirit they shall never bend nor check, Though mountain-heaps were loaded on my neck: Let feeble coward souls crouch with affright, The brave are ever firm—firm and upright. Then let the brazen fiery vault of heaven Crush me with instant ruin, rent and riven! (The fear and horror of a former age) If, from the friends and comrades that engage In common enterprize, I shrink or spare Myself or any soul! If I forbear Full vengeance and requital on my foes! All our antagonists! all that oppose! LXXII. A speechless messenger, the beacon's light, Announces danger from the mountain's height! Bridle your horses and prepare to fly: The final crisis of our fate is nigh! A momentary pause, a narrow space Detains them, but the foes approach apace! We must abide what fortune has decreed, And hope that heaven will help us at our need. Make your resolve! at home your means are great; Abroad you will retain a poor estate, Unostentatious, indigent, and scant, Yet live secure, at least from utter want. LXXIII. Alas, for our disgrace! Cerinthus lost! The fair Lelantian plain! a plundering host Invade it—all the brave banish'd or fled! Within the town, lewd ruffians in their stead Rule it at random.—Such is our disgrace! May Jove confound the Cypselizing race! LXXIV. My heart exults, the lively call obeying, When the shrill merry pipes are sweetly playing; With these, to chaunt aloud or to recite, To carol and carouse, is my delight: Or in a stedfast tone, bolder and higher, To temper with a touch, the manly lyre. The slavish visage never is erect; But looks oblique and language indirect Betray their origin—no lovely rose, Or hyacinth, from the rude bramble grows; Nor from a slavish and degraded breed, Can gentle words or courteous acts proceed. From noble Æthon my descent I trace, Thebes grants me refuge and a resting place; Forbear then, Arguris, with empty mirth, Yourself a slave, to scandalize my birth: Woman! I tell thee, wandering and forlorn, In exile and distress, much have I borne, Sorrows and wrongs and evils manifold; But, to be purchased as a slave and sold Has never been my fate, nor ever will; And I retain a town and country still, Along the banks of the Lethæan river, In a fair land, where I shall live for ever; For a firm friend, a steady partizan, A faithful and an honorable man, Disdaining every sordid act and mean, No slave am I, nor slavish have I been. LXXV. To seize my lost possessions, and bestow, Among my friends, the spoils of many a foe,— Such is my trust and hope; meanwhile I rest Content and cheerful, an admitted guest Conversing with a wise and worthy mind Profound in learning, and in taste refin'd: Watching his words and thoughts, to bear away Improvement and instruction day by day. LXXVI. Talk not of evils past! Ulysses bore Severer hardships than my own, and more; Doom'd to descend to Pluto's dreary reign, Yet he return'd, and view'd his home again, And wreak'd his vengeance on the plundering crew, The factious haughty suitors, whom he slew: Whilst all the while, with steady faith unfeign'd, The prudent, chaste Penelope remain'd, With her fair son, waiting a future hour, For his arrival and return to power. LXXVII. Kurnus, of all good things in human life, Nothing can equal goodness in a wife. In our own case, we prove the proverb true;— You vouch for me, my friend, and I for you. LXXVIII. May Jove assist me to discharge the debt Of kindness to my friends; and grant me yet A further boon—revenge upon my foes! With these accomplish'd, I could gladly close My term of life—a fair requital made; My friends rewarded, and my wrongs repaid. Gratitude and revenge, before I die, Might make me deem'd almost a Deity! Yet hear, O mighty Jove, and grant my prayer! Relieve me from affliction and despair! O take my life, or grant me some redress, Some foretaste of returning happiness! Such is my state—I cannot yet descry A chance of vengeance on mine enemy, The rude despoilers of my property. Whilst I, like to a scar'd and hunted hound, That scarce escaping, trembling and half drown'd, Crosses a gulley swelled with wintry rain, Have crept ashore in feebleness and pain. Yet my full wish—to drink their very blood— Some power divine, that watches for my good, May yet accomplish—soon may he fulfil My righteous hope—my just and hearty will. LXXIX. For human nature Hope remains alone Of all the deities—the rest are flown. Faith is departed, Truth and Honour dead, And all the Graces, too, my friends, are fled. The scanty specimens of living worth, Dwindled to nothing and extinct on earth. Yet whilst I live, and view the light of heaven, (Since Hope remains, and never has been driven From the distracted world), the single scope Of my devotion is to worship Hope: When hecatombs are slain and altars burn With all the deities ador'd in turn, Let Hope be present, and with Hope, my friend, Let every sacrifice commence and end. Yes! insolence, injustice, every crime, Rapine and wrong may prosper for a time; Yet shall they travel on to swift decay That tread the crooked path and hollow way. LXXX. I search among my friends—none can I find, No sterling unadulterated mind; None that abides the crucible like mine Rising above the standard—superfine! LXXXI. An exile has no friends! no partizan Is firm or faithful to the banish'd man; A disappointment and a punishment, Harder to bear and worse than banishment! LXXXII. The last and worst of ills, save death alone, The worst of human miseries is my own! Those friends of mine have cast me off—and I Must seek perforce a last resource, to try To treat and tamper with the enemy. LXXXIII. Happy the man, with worldly wealth and ease, Who, dying in good time, departs in peace: Not yet reduc'd to wander as a stranger, In exile and distress, and daily danger; To fawn upon his foes, to risk the trial Of a friend's faith, and suffer a denial! LXXXIV. No mean or coward heart will I commend In an old comrade or a party friend; Nor with ungenerous hasty zeal decry A noble-minded gallant enemy. LXXXV. Not to be born—never to see the sun! No worldly blessing is a greater one! And the next best is speedily to die— And lapt beneath a load of earth to lie! LXXXVI. For noble minds the worst of miseries, Worse than old age or wearisome disease, Is poverty—from poverty to flee, From some tall precipice prone to the sea It were a fair escape to leap below! In poverty, dear Kurnus, we forego Freedom in word and deed, body and mind: Action and thought, are fetter'd and confined. Let me then fly, dear Kurnus, once again! Wide as the limits of the land and main, From these entanglements; with these in view Death is the lighter evil of the two. LXXXVII. Wearied and sick at heart, in seas of trouble, I work against the wind, and strive to double The dark disastrous cape of poverty. LXXXVIII. All kinds of shabby shifts are understood, All kinds of arts are practised, bad and good; All kinds of ways to gain a livelihood. LXXXIX. I cannot warble like a nightingale; This voice of mine, I fear, is like to fail, With rambling on a revel late at night. I shall not make a poor excuse, to slight Your piper's art and practice; but the friend; That ought to bear his part here and attend, In fact is absent—I must do my best, And put my talent fairly to the test. So, praying to the gods for help and grace, Close to the piper's side I take my place. XC. O poverty! how sorely do you press, Debasing soul and body with distress: To such degrading offices you bind A manly form, an elevated mind, Once elegantly fashion'd and refined. XCI. I wish that a fair trial were prepared, Friend Academus! with the prize declared, A comely slave, the conqueror's reward; For a full proof, betwixt myself and you, Which is the better minstrel of the two. Then would I show you that a Mule surpasses, In his performance, all the breed of Asses. Enough of such discourse. Now let us try To join our best endeavours, you and I, With voice and music, since the muse has bless'd Us both with her endowments; and possessed With the fair science of harmonious sound The neighbouring people and the cities round. XCII. You boast of wealth, and scornfully deplore My poverty—something I have in store; And with God's blessing I shall make it more. XCIII. Though gifted with a shrewd and subtle ken, Timagoras!—the secret hearts of men (You'll find it) are a point hard to be guess'd; For poor and shabby souls, in riches dress'd, Make a fair show; while indigence and care Give to the noble mind a meaner air. XCIV. Dunces are often rich, while indigence Thwarts the designs of elegance and sense; Nor wealth alone, nor judgment can avail: In either case, art and improvement fail. XCV. The passions and the wants of nature breed Winged desires, that with an airy speed Hurry abroad, for pleasure or for need, On various errands, various as their hue— A fluttering, eager, ever busy crew. XCVI. Plutus, of all the Gods, the first and best! My wrongs with your assistance are redrest; Now, reinstated in respectability, In spite of all my baseness and humility. XCVII. My old companions, Fancy and Desire! To treat you both, as each of you require, My means are insufficient—never mind! Ours is the common case of human-kind. XCVIII. Current expenditure—to bring it all Within the compass of our capital, Is a wise plan, but difficult withal. Could we beforehand ascertain the date Of our existence, we might fix a rate For our expense, and make it more or less; But, as it is, we must proceed by guess. The road divides! which path am I to choose? Perplex'd with opposite diverging views. Say, shall I struggle on, to save and spare, Or lead an easy life, and banish care? Some have I seen, with competence of wealth, Indifferent to friendship, pleasure, health, Struggling and saving; till the final call, Death sends his summons, and confiscates all! Allotting to the thankless heedless heir, The produce of his economic care! Yet others have I seen reckless of pelf— “I take my pastime, and I please myself—” Such was the jolly phrase: the same gallant Have I beheld an utter mendicant; In sad dependence, at his latter end, Watching and importuning every friend. Our wiser course then, Damocles! I deem, Is that which steers aloof from each extreme: Not to consume my life with care and pain, Economizing for another's gain; And least of all, to risk the future fears Of indigence in my declining years. With this reflection, therefore, I incline To lean a little to the saving line; For something should be left, when life is fled, To purchase decent duty to the dead; Those easy tears, the customary debt Of kindly recollection and regret. Besides, the saving of superfluous cost Is a sure profit, never wholly lost; Not altogether lost, though left behind, Bequeath'd in kindness to a friendly mind. And for the present, can a lot be found Fairer and happier than a name renown'd, And easy competence, with honor crown'd; The just approval of the good and wise, Public applauses, friendly courtesies; Where all combine, a single name to grace With honour and pre-eminence of place, Coevals, elders, and the rising race! XCIX. Peace is my wish,—may peace and plenty crown This happy land, the people and the town! May peace remain! and may we never miss Good cheer and merry meetings such as this! Whether at home or here, all wars I hate, All battle I detest and execrate. Then never hurry forward! for we fight Not for ourselves nor for our country's right. But with the bawling herald, loud and clear, Shouting a noisy summons in my ear, And with my own good horse, for very shame, We must engage and join the bloody game. C. [The Gods have granted mighty stores of pelf] The Gods have granted mighty stores of pelf To many a sluggard, useless to himself And his own partizans: but high renown Awaits the warrior who defends the town. CI. O Plutus! justly, to your gifts and you, Mankind attribute praise and honor due. With your assistance, we securely face Defeat and disappointment and disgrace. Thus to reward the virtuous, and to slight Wicked and dirty knaves, is surely right; For with the world at large, no merit tells, But Plutus and his bounty,—nothing else! No! not the sense of Rhadamanthus old, Nor all the shrewd devices manifold, Which Sisyphus, the keen Corinthian, knew; That wily chief, that, if old tales are true, Made a most strange escape, so poets tell,— By dint of rhetoric, he return'd from hell! For she (that kind oblivion can dispense, But takes away the judgement and the sense) The Goddess Proserpine, by strong persuasion, Consented to connive at his evasion— A thing unheard of, and unknown before; That, having pass'd the dark infernal door, And visited those dreary realms below, From that disastrous prison-house of woe, A man by policy should work his way, Emerging into light and upper day! Sisyphus gain'd a point which none beside (Of all that ever liv'd or ever died) Could have achiev'd—yet Sisyphus would fail: Nor would Ulysses with his arts prevail: Nor aged Nestor with his eloquence— No merit would avail you, no pretence, Though you possess'd the vigour and the speed Of the swift Harpies, or the winged breed Of Boreas—in the proud Olympic game A conqueror! your native place and name Recorded and announc'd with loud acclaim; Still, would you find the common saying hold, “Fame is a jest: favour is bought and sold: “No power on earth is like the power of gold.” CII. Enjoy your time, my soul! another race Will shortly fill the world, and take your place, With their own hopes and fears, sorrow and mirth: I shall be dust the while, and crumbled earth. But think not of it! Drink the racy wine Of rich Taygetus, pressed from the vine Which Theotimus in the sunny glen, (Old Theotimus, lov'd by Gods and men) Planted, and water'd from a plenteous source, Teaching the wayward stream a better course— Drink it, and cheer your heart, and banish care— A load of wine will lighten our despair. CIII. Ye twins of Jove! an undivided twain, That on Eurotas' shore and happy plain In endless harmony preside and reign, Punish our guilt! If ever by design, I wrong my friend, let all the loss be mine: But, if the fault is his, double the fine! CIV. Now that in mid career, checking his course, The bright sun pauses in his pride and force, Let us prepare to dine, and eat and drink The best of every thing that heart can think; And let the shapely Spartan damsel fair Bring, with a rounded arm and graceful air, Water to wash, and garlands for our hair. In spite of all the systems and the rules Invented and observ'd by sickly fools, Let us be brave, and resolutely drink, Not minding if the dog-star rise or sink. CV. May Jove, the Almighty, with his own right hand Guard and uphold this happy town and land! With all the glorious blessed Gods above! And may the bright Apollo guide and move My voice and fancy, cunningly to carp In songs accordant to the pipe and harp! When, after solemn rites of sacrifice, At feasts and banquets freely we devise Of mirth and pastime, banishing afar All fears of Persia and her threaten'd war; With joyous airy songs of merry verse, Quaffing and chanting—“May we ne'er be worse,” But better, if a better thing can be, Than thus to live at ease, cheerful and free; While far remote, no fears our thoughts engage Of death approaching, or disastrous age. CVI. You great Apollo, with its walls and towers Fenc'd and adorn'd of old this town of ours! Such favour in thy sight Alcathous won, Of Pelops old the fair and manly son. Now therefore in thy clemency divine, Protect these very walls, our own and thine! Guide and assist us, turn aside the boast Of the destroying, haughty Persian host! So shall thy people each returning spring Slay fatted hecatombs; and gladly bring Fair gifts, with chaunted hymns, and lively song, Dances and feasts, and happy shouts among; Before thy altar, glorifying Thee, In peace and health and wealth, cheerful and free. Yet much I fear the faction and the strife, Throughout our Grecian cities, raging rife And their wild councils. But, do thou defend This town of ours, our founder and our friend! Wide have I wander'd, far beyond the sea, Even to the distant shores of Sicily; To broad Eubœa's plentiful domain, With the rich vineyards, in its planted plain; And to the sunny wave and winding edge Of fair Eurotas with its reedy sedge— Where Sparta stands in simple majesty: Among her manly rulers, there was I! Greeted and welcom'd (there and every where) With courteous entertainment—kind and fair; Yet still my weary spirit would repine, Longing again to view this land of mine. Henceforward no design nor interest Shall ever move me but the first and best, With learning's happy gift to celebrate, Adorn and dignify my native State. The song, the dance, music and verse agreeing, Will occupy my life, and fill my being: Pursuits of elegance and learned skill (With good repute and kindness and good will, Among the wiser sort) will pass my time Without an enemy, without a crime; Harmless and just with every rank of men Both the free native and the denizen. CVII. The Gods in just allotment have assign'd Youth and old age, the portion of mankind, Alike for all; impartially we share Youth's early pleasures; equally we bear The latter ills of life, sickness and care. One single evil, more severe and rude Than age or sickness or decrepitude, Is dealt unequally; for him that rears A thankless offspring, in his latter years Ungratefully requited for his pains, A parsimonious life, and thrifty gains With toil and care acquir'd for their behoof, And no return but insolent reproof, Such as might scare a beggar from the gate, A wretch unknown, poor and importunate! To be revil'd, avoided, hated, curst; This is the last of evils, and the worst! CVIII. The servant of the Muse, gifted and grac'd With high pre-eminence of art and taste, Has an allotted duty to fulfil; Bound to dispense the treasure of his skill, Without a selfish or invidious view; Bound to recite, and to compose anew; Not to reserve his talent for himself, In secret, like a miser with his pelf. TRANSLATIONS FROM “THE POEM OF THE CID.” [They fain would sally forth, but he, the noble Cid] I. ARGUMENT. The Cid being driven into banishment by the intrigues of his enemies, is accompanied by several of his friends and followers, for whom he undertakes to provide by carrying on a predatory war against the Moors. In the course of their adventures they surprise the Castle of Alcocer, but are soon after surrounded and besieged by a superior army. After some difference of opinion, the Cid yields to the wishes of his followers, and determines upon a sally, which is successful. From line 670 to 772. They fain would sally forth, but he, the noble Cid, Accounted it as rashness, and constantly forbid. The fourth week was beginning, the third already past, The Cid and his companions they are now agreed at last. “The water is cut off, the bread is well nigh spent, “To allow us to depart by night the Moors will not consent. “To combat with them in the field our numbers are but few, “Gentlemen, tell me your minds, what do you think to do?” Minaya Alvar Fañez answer'd him again, “We are come here from fair Castile to live like banish'd men. “There are here six hundred of us, beside some nine or ten; “It is by fighting with the Moors that we have earn'd our bread, “In the name of God that made us, let nothing more be said, “Let us sally forth upon them by the dawn of day.” The Cid replied, “Minaya, I approve of what you say, “You have spoken for the best, and had done so without doubt.” The Moors that were within the town they took and turn'd them out, That none should know their secret; they labour'd all that night, They were ready for the combat with the morning light. The Cid was in his armour mounted at their head, He spoke aloud amongst them, you shall hear the words he said: “We must all sally forth! There can not a man be spared, “Two footmen only at the gates to close them and keep guard; “If we are slain in battle, they will bury us here in peace, “If we survive and conquer, our riches will increase. “And you, Pero Bermuez, the standard you must bear, “Advance it like a valiant man, evenly and fair; “But do not venture forward before I give command.” Bermuez took the standard, he went and kiss'd his hand. The gates were then thrown open, and forth at once they rush'd, The outposts of the Moorish host back to the camp were push'd; The camp was all in tumult, and there was such a thunder Of cymbals and of drums, as if earth would cleave in sunder. There you might see the Moors arming themselves in haste, And the two main battles how they were forming fast; Horsemen and footmen mix'd, a countless troop and vast. The Moors are moving forward, the battle soon must join, “My men, stand here in order, ranged upon a line! “Let not a man move from his rank before I give the sign.” Pero Bermuez heard the word, but he could not refrain. He held the banner in his hand, he gave his horse the rein; “You see yon foremost squadron there, the thickest of the foes, “Noble Cid, God be your aid, for there your banner goes! “Let him that serves and honours it show the duty that he owes.” Earnestly the Cid call'd out, “For heaven's sake, be still!” Bermuez cried, “I cannot hold,” so eager was his will. He spurr'd his horse, and drove him on amid the Moorish rout; They strove to win the banner, and compass'd him about. Had not his armour been so true he had lost either life or limb; The Cid call'd out again, “For heaven's sake, succour him!” Their shields before their breasts, forth at once they go, Their lances in the rest levell'd fair and low; Their banners and their crests waving in a row, Their heads all stooping down toward the saddle bow. The Cid was in the midst, his shout was heard afar, “I am Ruy Diaz, the Champion of Bivar; “Strike amongst them, gentlemen, for sweet mercy's sake!” There where Bermuez fought, amidst the foe they brake, Three hundred banner'd knights, it was a gallant show: Three hundred Moors they kill'd, a man with every blow; When they wheel'd and turn'd, as many more lay slain, You might see them raise their lances and level them again. There you might see the breastplates, how they were cleft in twain, And many a Moorish shield lie shatter'd on the plain. The pennons that were white mark'd with a crimson stain, The horses running wild whose riders had been slain. The Christians call upon Saint James, the Moors upon Mahound, There were thirteen hundred of them slain on a little spot of ground. Minaya Alvar Fañez smote with all his might, He went as he was wont, and was foremost in the fight. There was Galin Garcia, of courage firm and clear, Felez Munioz, the Cid's own cousin dear; Antolinez of Burgos, a hardy knight and keen, Munio Gustioz, his pupil that had been. The Cid on his gilded saddle above them all was seen. There was Martin Munioz, that ruled in Montmayor, There were Alvar Fañez and Alvar Salvador: These were the followers of the Cid, with many others more, In rescue of Bermuez and the standard that he bore. Minaya is dismounted, his courser has been slain, He fights upon his feet, and smites with might and main. The Cid came all in haste to help him to horse again; He saw a Moor well mounted, thereof he was full fain, Through the girdle at a stroke he cast him to the plain: He call'd to Minaya Fañez and reach'd him out the rein, “Mount and ride, Minaya, you are my right hand, “We shall have need of you to-day, these Moors will not disband!” Minaya leapt upon the horse, his sword was in his hand; Nothing that came near him could resist him or withstand; All that fall within his reach he despatches as he goes. The Cid rode to King Fariz, and struck at him three blows; The third was far the best, it forced the blood to flow: The stream ran from his side, and stain'd his arms below; The King caught round the rein, and turn'd his back to go, The Cid has won the battle with that single blow. II. ARGUMENT. On the death of King Almudafar, his sons Zulema and Abenalfange divided his dominions; the former had the kingdom of Zaragosa, and put it under the protection of the Cid. The latter had the kingdom of Denia; and, as there began to be great enmity between the brothers, Abenalfange was helped by Don Pedro king of Aragon and Count Don Ramon Berenger of Barcelona, who thereby became enemies of the Cid. The Cid with 200 horsemen attacked the lands of Alcaniz, and after that infested Huesca and Montalban. Of this tidings were taken to the king of Denia, and to the Count of Barcelona, who attack the Cid in a valley near the Pine-wood of Thebar, are routed, the Count taken prisoner, and his sword Colada taken by the Cid. The Count refuses all food, and starves himself for three days, till the Cid promises him and two of his followers their freedom if he eats a hearty dinner, which he does, and obtains his freedom. From line 965 to 1089. The news spread wide and far, it reached Count Ramon's ear, The Count of Barcelona Don Ramon Berenger, How the Cid Ruy Diaz was riding far and near, Plundering all the country. The Count was bold and hot, A proud and angry word was spoken on the spot: “Ruy Diaz has offended us and evermore offends; “He smote my kinsman in the court and never made amends; “And here he comes to rob the Moors, my neighbours and my friends, “That pay me for protection, and live within my league. “I never join'd against him with faction or intrigue, “Or was his secret enemy, or defied him as a foe, “Or wrong'd him or attack'd him; but since he wills it so, “Since he comes against us, against him we must go.” The Count with all his vassals is mustering strong and fast— They throng in troops together and follow forth in haste, Christian Knights and Franks, and Moors of every caste, Riding in hot pursuit of the Champion of Bivar, And there at length they found him, at the Pine-wood of Thebar; It was a three days' march before they reach'd so far. The Cid came with his plunder, a convoy large and good, Descending from the mountain to a vale beside the wood; A summons there was sent him from the Count Berenger, The Cid, when he received it, returned a messenger— “Tell the Count Berenger we mean to part from hence; “We wish to part in peace, we never meant offence; “Whatever gain we made was not at his expense.” The Count, in haste and anger, replied—“it is not true; “He shall now pay me for the past, and for the present too; “I shall teach this outlaw the respect that is my due.” Wi' that the messenger returned; the Cid might fairly see That he must risk a battle, it might no better be. “Look to your baggage, gentlemen, set all the gear apart, “And arm yourselves for battle, we fight before we part. “Our enemies are here at hand with a mighty threat and boast, “The Count of Barcelona forsooth with all his host!— “Franks and Moors together I know not which are most: “But since they come pursuing, and their intent is clear “To attack us as they find us, we'll fight our battle here: “They will be riding down the slope with a broken pace; “Our saddles are all firm and deep, well girded in their place, “And theirs are easy surcingles and saddles for a race. “You will not find among them one well arm'd cavalier; “A hundred of our number might fight them without fear: “Before they reach the valley let us meet them with the spear; “For one man that you strike three saddles will be clear. “We shall teach the Count Don Ramon Berenger, “With knighthood and with practice and proof of manhood shear, “What kind of knights and what a chief he comes pursuing here, “To take our booty from us, the spoil we bought so dear!” And now the noble Cid had finish'd his discourse; His knights are rang'd in order, each upon his horse. The Franks come down the hill with a random course. Just where the mountain ended, at the valley's source, The Cid gave orders to his men to charge with all their force: That order they perform'd with all their soul and heart, With pennons and with lances so well they play'd their part, Some are pierc'd and wounded, others beaten down, The Count is taken captive, his host is overthrown, His sword that was worth a thousand marks, the Cid has made his own, The noble sword Colada that through the world was known. He has adorn'd that mighty beard with honour and renown, His beard, that as a banish'd man was left all overgrown— The Count is taken with the Cid in close and steady ward A surety for his creditors for them to watch and guard— The Cid came from his tent, and at the door he stood, His knights are crowding round him, all in a merry mood, Right merry was the Cid, the spoil was rich and good.— For the service of the Cid a banquet was prepar'd, Count Ramon would not eat of it, or pay the least regard; They serv'd the meat before him. He laugh'd at them again— “I would not eat a morsel for all the wealth of Spain; “I would rather lose my life, and perish here outright, “Since such a set of ragged knaves have conquer'd me in fight.” The good Cid Ruy Diaz, these were the words he said: “Eat and drink, Sir Count, of the wine and of the bread, “If you do as I advise you shortly may be free, “Else you can never hope a Christian land to see— “Be merry, Don Rodrigo—feast and make good cheer.” “I shall not eat a morsel; I mean to perish here.”— They shar'd and pack'd the booty; till the third day was past, The Count continued still to famish and to fast. They could not make him eat a morsel nor a crumb: At length the worthy Cid said, “Come, Sir Ramon, come! “If ever you design to return to Christendom, “You needs must break your fast; therefore if you'll agree “To eat a goodly dinner fairly and lustily, “With two companions of your choice, I promise all the three “To quit you from your prison, and leave you ransom-free.” The Count was joyful at the word, and answer'd cheerfully: “Cid, if you mean it as you say, this way to ransom me, “As long as I shall live a marvel it will be.”— “Then come to dinner, Count, and when you've eat your fill, “You with your two companions may go whene'er you will; “But for the booty that I gain'd, I mean to keep it still: “No not a farthing will I give of all the wealth you lost, “Your plea was overthrown in fight, and you must pay the cost; “Besides, I want the goods myself, for the service of my host, “My ragged hearty followers, my safeguard and my boast; “Thus we must live, till Heaven above has otherwise disposed, “Standing in anger of the king, with all the best and most “Of our inheritance and lands sequester'd and foreclosed; “As is the wont of banish'd men, we needs must think it fair “To keep our troop together, with plundering here and there.” The Count was pleased, and call'd for water for his hands, A bason with the banquet was brought at his commands; Two knights were with him, that the Cid released him ransomless; I warrant all the three were joyous at the mess. Then spoke the noble Cid—“Sir Count, before we part, “You must perform your promise, and eat with all your heart, “Else I must keep you with me to whet your appetite.” The Count replied—“The contract shall be fulfill'd aright; “I promise you to do my part, and do it with delight.” The noble-minded Cid stood smiling there beside To see the Count at meat, so fast his hands he plied. “An' if it be your pleasure, Cid, now that our dinner's done, “Give order for our horses, and let us hence be gone; “Of all the meals I ever made this is the heartiest one.”— Three palfreys were brought up to them, with saddles rich and fair, With mantles and with housings of cloth and peltry rare. The Count was in the midst, his knights on either side, The Cid for half a stage would escort him on his ride;— “Farewell Sir Count! you leave me ransomless and frank; “I quit you with all courtesies; and furthermore I thank “Your bounty for the booty you left with me behind; “And if you should repent of it, or chance to change your mind, “And wish to mend your luck, whenever you're inclined, “Myself and my companions are easy folks to find:— “But if you leave me quiet, (as well, methinks, you may) “Your lands will fare the better; and on a future day “With your own goods or others perhaps I may repay.”— “Cid, you may fairly boast, you're safe upon that head; “For this year and the next my score is fully paid; “And as for coming after you let nothing more be said.” The Count went crowding on his pace, and looking fast behind Pressing and urging onward, he doubted in his mind The Cid might change his purpose. He little knew the Cid; That would have been a treason,—a thing he never did; He never would have done so base an act—not even To purchase all the gold and treasure under heaven. III. ARGUMENT. The Cid—after various successes, having won the city of Valencia, and having overthrown the king of Seville (who was sent with 30,000 men to besiege him) in the battle of Villa Nueva, in which every footsoldier shared 100 marks of silver—fearing lest his people who were now rich should return to their own country, took counsel with Alvar Fanez and others, when Minaya advised that proclamation should be made that no man should leave the city without permission of the Cid, on pain of losing all he had and being impaled. With this view the Cid orders an account to be taken of all his vassals, sends Alvar Fanez and Martin Antolinez with presents to the king, Don Alphonso, beseeching him to let his wife and daughters join him,—re-makes Valencia into a bishoprick, and makes the pilgrim Don Jerom bishop. The king receives the messengers favourably, and orders that the ladies have a guard to escort them throughout his dominions, and restores the Cid and his followers to favour. From line 1263 to 1379. I wish for an account “Of all my vassals here, their number and amount, “Their grants of tenements and lands, Minaya, will you look “To mark their names in writing, and count them in a book— —“For the service of Valencia this shall be the law— “If any man shall leave it, to desert us and withdraw, “He shall resign and vacate his tenure, to divide “Among my followers here, that in the town abide, “That watch the city walls, and keep the country side.” Minaya said—“The thing can easily be done.” He summon'd them to Court, they came there every one; He wrote their names in order, and made a fair account, Three thousand and six hundred was the complete amount. “Thanks be to God, Minaya, the troop was thinner far “When we rode forth as exiles from my manor at Bivar: “As we have prosper'd hitherto so shall we prosper still; “Yet farther, if you like it, and if it suits your will, “I fain would send you forth for a message into Spain, “To see my Lord Alphonso my lawful king again. “A hundred goodly steeds for a present you shall bring, “A portion of the booty, to present them to the king. “Then you shall kiss his hands intreating earnestly “That he will condescend to set my wife and daughters free— “And for their coming with you, these words shall be the token; “The words they recollect, that heretofore were spoken:— “That the Cid's daughters and his wife, upon some future day, “As rich and mighty dames should ride in proud array “To meet their worthy father within some foreign land, “Where he should reign a conqueror in honour and command.” “I'll do it,” said Minaya, “with all my soul and heart.” He sets affairs in order preparing to depart, With a hundred men-at-arms as an escort strong and fair; And a thousand marks of silver must Alvar Fanez bear To the Convent of San Pedro, for the good abbot there. While thus they were discoursing, and mirth and hope increased A pilgrim came amongst them, from adventures in the East, A clerk of holy Church and shaven as a priest: Don Jerom was his name, a person of discerning, Courteous and discreet, and famous for his learning; A worthy man besides, on horseback or on foot, And thither was he come, for his errand and pursuit Had been to join the Cid, that he might fight his fill, Sword-in-hand among the Moors, to cut them down and kill.— The Cid with his arrival was pleased and satisfied; He took Minaya Fanez to speak with him aside. “Hear me, Minaya Fanez! in Heaven's name I say, “Of all that Heaven has blessed us with, something we must repay: “And therefore of my conquest this shall be the fruit, “I'll make a bishop here, and a bishopric to boot; “And this same good Don Jerom the bishop he shall be. “Where can we find in all our host a better clerk than he? “These will be goodly tidings, happy news and fair, “Reported in Castille at your arrival there.” Minaya was agreed; the thing was done as said, And therewithal Don Jerom was a bishop made, Invested and endow'd with lands and yearly rent; And, oh! what happy tidings thro' Christendom were sent, In all the courts of Christendom, and ev'ry town of Spain, That a bishop in Valencia was appointed once again. Minaya took his leave, and forth in haste he prest His journey through Valencia; the country was at rest: As for his other travel, I care not to recite The stages that he made or where he stopt at night. He rides inquiring for the king; at last he comes to know, “The king was at St. Fagunt a little while ago, “Meaning to go to Carrion so people understood.” Minaya rode to Carrion, to find him if he could, Ready with his present in case the king should pass; And there at once he met him returning from the Mass. Behold Minaya Fanez, in presence of the crowd, He knelt before the king and made his moan aloud:— “The good Cid Ruy Diaz salutes you as is meet, “As a good vassal to his lord, kissing your hands and feet; “He is driven from your kingdom, and he has lost your love, “Be gracious to him, good my Lord, for heaven's sake above; “Though living as a banish'd man, yet hath he prosper'd well “Within the Moorish border, such tidings I can tell. “He has taken towns and lands and castles many a one, “Xerica and Almenar, Cebola, Casteion; “He has taken Penna Cadella, the fortress and the hill, “He has taken Murviedro, which is far better still; “He is master of Valencia and rules it at his will; “He has made a bishop of his own, with mitre, ring, and pall; “He has fought five battles in the field, and conquer'd in them all; “Great is the wealth and booty that, by the will of heaven, “The Cid hath purchased in the field, and largely hath he thriven; “And here I bring your Grace a sample and a token, “In proof of his allegiance, and that the truth is spoken,— “A hundred noble coursers, strong and tall and fleet, “With saddles and caparisons, and all equipments meet; “He sends his humble present, kissing your Grace's hands, “And owns himself your vassal in his Lordship and his lands.” The king lift up his hand, made a cross upon his brow, The Cid was grown, he thought, to power and wealth enow. “As heaven shall be my speed, heaven and St. Isidore, “I like these tidings well from the Cid Campeador, “And I receive his present and thank him furthermore.” But the Count Garci Ordonnez, at his heart's inmost core, The more the king was satisfied, was envious and sore. “If the Cid conquers at this rate, if all is true that's said, “What has become of all the Moors? the people must be dead.” The king said, “Hold your peace, and make no more ado; “The Cid has serv'd me more and better far than you.” With that Minaya Fanez made a manly speech:— “The Cid entreats your favour and fain he would beseech “Your warrant and your licence (if so your Grace should please), “As for his wife and daughters to grant them their release,— “To take them from the convent whereat they now remain, “And bring them to Valencia, to see them once again.” “It pleases me right well,” the noble king replied: “A convoy they shall have, where'er they pass or ride, “To defend them from dishonour or offence that may betide “In all my country's bounds, up to the border's side: “But when they pass the border the charge will rest with you, “To attend them and protect them, as is their right and due. “—Ye knights and nobles of the court, my vassals, hear ye me! “Henceforth shall Ruy Diaz stand unimpeach'd and free; “I quit him from all forfeiture and other detriment, “And for his followers that have lost their heritage and rent “In favour of the Cid I grant it back again, “To enable them to serve him there in his new domain.” Minaya kissed his hand, and thank'd him for his grace. Then spoke the noble king, with his smiling, manly face, “Whichever of my vassals is minded to resort “To Valencia with the Cid may freely leave the court; “And he shall hold his lands unforfeited and free; “And I shall own his service as a vassalage to me.” IV. ARGUMENT. Alvar Fanez and Martin Antolinez, having taken leave of the King, go to the monastery of St. Pedro de Cardena, where Dona Ximena and her daughters were, and bring them to within three leagues of Valencia, where they are met by the Cid on his famous horse Babieca. He runs a career with him, and at the end of the course, alighting, goes towards his wife and daughters. Donna Ximena kneels to receive him; he conducts them into Valencia, where they are received with great rejoicings. In the spring, Yusef, King of Morocco, sends an army against Valencia. The Cid shows his wife and daughters the Moors landing, and entering the gardens round the city. Alvar Salvadores makes a sally, and drives the Moors back to their tents, but is himself taken prisoner. Next day, after early mass by the Bishop Don Jerom, who obtained the boon of being first in the battle, the Cid attacks the Moors, who are utterly routed, and wounds King Yusef, who escapes him. On his return to the city, the Cid declares his intention of giving the ladies attendant on his wife and daughters in marriage to his vassals, with a dowry out of the plunder of two hundred marks of silver to each of them. The King of Morocco's tent he reserves for the King Don Alphonso, and, in addition to his share of the booty, gives a tithe of his own fifth to the Bishop Don Jerom. From line 1603 to 1809. She knelt before the Cid there in the people's sight: “Cid, in a lucky hour were you girded as a knight; “Full often have you rescued me from injury and wrong: “And now, sir, with Heaven's blessing, here I have brought along, “To glad you with their presence, your own dear daughters both, “Reared in noble nurture and of good health and growth.” The Cid embraced them all with pleasure and surprize; The tears for very joy were streaming from their eyes. Then spake the noble Cid the words that you shall hear: “Beloved and honoured woman, and you, my children dear, “The pride and solace of my heart, my darlings, welcome here; “Come hither to Valencia, the mansion and the land “That I have purchased for you!” They knelt and kissed his hand. He took them to the palace in triumph through the town, He showed them from the tower the prospect looking down, The city spread below, the cultivated plain, The garden of Valencia, the paradise of Spain, Stretching beyond the sight, the mountains and the main Encompassing it round; they lift their hands and eyes, To Heaven that had bestowed so fair and rich a prize. There were pastimes fair enow at the entrance of the town, Of tourneying and riding and riving targets down, And hurling darts and snapping spears that it was joy to see, With songs and instruments among, and mirth and minstrelsy; The Cid with his companions has kept a noble court, The while the winter lasted, in solace and disport. The winter is departed, for March is coming in: And I must tell you tidings, the tidings that begin To reach us day by day from parts beyond the sea, From Africa and Morocco; King Yusef there is he, Ruling the mighty realm with strength and chivalry. And the report has reached his ears of all the Cid has done, Of towns and castles taken and battles fought and won: The kingdom of Valencia he detains it as his own, And owns no Lord on earth, but holds from Christ alone. This Emperor of Morocco has assembled all his host: And fifty thousand warriors are encamped upon the coast; They put themselves on shipboard and shortly cross the main, They disembark in haste along the coast of Spain, They move towards Valencia, and encamp upon the plain. The Cid has seen and heard it:—“I thank the Lord above! “All upon earth that I possess, with all the things I love, “Are here assembled round me, my children and my wife, “And this my goodly conquest atchieved with toil and strife, “I never mean to leave it while I retain my life.”— —“But sure this Emp'ror, like a courteous gentle knight, “Has sent us out a pageant for our pastime and delight, “That I may bear a part in, in my wife and daughters' sight, “And attire myself for battle and enter in the fight; “That they may see with their own eyes the life we long have led, “In daily combat with the Moors, earning our daily bread.” He took the ladies up on high to the tower of the Alcazar, They saw the Moorish camp in all the pride of war, The banners and pavilions stretching wide and far. “Cid,—for mercy's sake! what upon earth is this?” —“Nothing at all, my worthy dame—nothing that comes amiss. “The Moors are arrived to greet you, their courtesy to pay, “With a present for your daughters against their wedding-day: “Remain, then, in the palace, or here in the Alcazar, “And never feel alarm'd if you see me join the war, “By the blessing of the Lord and of St. Mary bright “We shall prosper once again and conquer in the fight, “And with your presence here, and, combatting in your sight, “My heart feels larger than before—joyous, alert, and light.” Now from the Moorish host, with the first dawn of day, Their heavy drums began to thunder and to bray: The Cid was joyous at the sounds—“there comes a noble day!” The ladies all are trembling with terror and dismay: The Cid looked smiling on them with his hand upon his beard, “Courage, noble ladies, there is nothing to be fear'd; “The drums there that are making the noises that are heard, “You shall have them brought before you, within a fortnight space, “To view their shape and make here in this very place: “We shall dispose them afterwards as the bishop may desire, “To remain for a memorial in the cathedral quire; “It is a vow recorded—a vow the Cid has made, “To present them for an offering, and it must needs be paid:” Thus has he cheer'd the ladies, they felt no more afraid. The Moorish cavaliers are advancing without fear, They enter in the Huerta and approach the city near: The watchman in the barbican has smitten on the bell, The Christians are assembled, armed and accoutred well, They sally forth in order with an eager fierce attack— The Moors are broken with the shock, routed and driven back. In the charge and the pursuit five hundred Moors were slain, The Christians follow them in haste to the tents upon the plain, But by their own mischance, ere they returned again, Alvar Salvador was left a prisoner to remain; The rest are all return'd that dine at the Cid's board. The adventures of the day they report them to their Lord: The Cid has seen and heard it—he spake a merry word: “Gentlemen, for this day's work our chance has not been ill, “To-morrow with God's blessing we shall do better still; “Our Bishop, good Don Jerom, an early mass shall say “And give us absolution before the dawn of day. “Then we shall sally forth and assault them in the names “Of the Lord and his Apostle our worthy good St. James.” There was an answer all at once, one answer from the whole: “With all our hearts,” the knights replied, “with all our hearts and soul. Minaya was in haste, and thus he spake his mind: “Cid, since you so determine, leave six more men behind; “Go forward with the rest, and let the battle join, “And God will send us succour on your side or on mine. “Let it be so!” the Cid replied. The night was coming on. The Christians all were armed betimes, accoutred every one. At the second cock-crow, before the dawn of day, The Bishop Don Jeronimo was ready mass to say. He sang the mass full solemnly in the cathedral quire, And gave them absolution, perfect and entire. “He that falls in battle, his face against the foe, “I make him clean of all his sins his soul to heaven shall go. “And now, right worthy Cid, for the mass that has been chanted, “I shall require a boon and it must needs be granted. —“The foremost place in battle and the first stroke of the fight.” “Let it be yours,” the Cid replied, “it is a claim of right.” They sally forth, arm'd and equipp'd, beyond the city wall: The Cid is there amongst them, to arrange and order all: Babieca, his good courser, bearing him gallantly Arm'd and attired for battle, a goodly sight to see! A guard is left to keep the gates, men of high trust and worth: And now beyond the gates the banner is borne forth; Thirty less four thousand was the number at the most To encounter fifty thousand, such was the Moorish host. They rush upon them all at once, without a thought of fear: Minaya chose his time to charge the flank and rear. The Moors with sudden onset, such was the will of Heaven, Were broken and confused, and wide asunder driven: The Cid with his spear in hand and sword so sharp and good, From the elbow to the point dripping down with blood, The number that he slew was never understood. He singled out King Yusef; the King durst not abide So fearful an assault, but fast away 'gan ride To the castle of Guyera, a palace fortified: There was he safely lodged; but till he reach'd the place, The Cid was foremost in pursuit, nor ever left the chace. Now with his followers he returns, rejoiced and satisfied:— He has gain'd a mighty booty, he has check'd the Moorish pride; And his courser, Babieca, has been fully proved and tried. The plunder of the camp was plentiful and great— Coin of gold and silver, and gold and silver plate, And other riches more than they could estimate. The Cid has left Minaya to take a just account, Returning to Valencia before he would dismount; An hundred knights were with him, he rode an easy pace, Armed as he was before, all but his head and face. There might his countenance be seen furrow'd with a frown— Sword-in-hand, upon his steed he enter'd in the town. He has rein'd him up before the porch, there, where the ladies stood Ready to receive him. He spoke in merry mood: “Welcome, welcome, ladies! we have purchased great renown— “I have conquer'd in the field—and you have kept the town. “It shows the will of Heaven, that it hath pleased to bless “Your first arrival here with victory and success. “You see my courser reeking, my sword with slaughter red— “Such is the fashion among knights when Moors are slain and fled. “Pray God to spare my life for two years or for three, “Then gentlemen and knights shall salute you on their knee.” These words the Cid has spoken before he lighted down— His daughters with their ladies, his dame of high renown, Bent the knee before him and kiss'd his hand with tears— “We live, sir, in your favour,—may you live these many years!” Then passing onward from the porch, to the rich hall he goes, Sitting amongst them, for a while, in silence and repose— “Hoh! Donna Ximena, my wife, it is a scheme of mine— “You never mention'd it yourself, but this is my design— “The ladies, your attendants, that have been brought to stay, “I mean to marry them forthwith to the vassals in my pay, “And to give each two hundred marks upon their wedding-day. “They have served a noble lady, folks in Castille will say— —“The marriage of our daughters for the present we delay.” They rose and kiss'd his hand; so, from the first report, Till the Cid's promise was fulfill'd, great was the mirth and sport, The gladness and rejoicing in the camp and in the court. Minaya still was in the camp, busied all the day, Reckoning and writing, and assorting all the prey, And dealing with the shares of plunder and of pay. The whole amount of wealth was more than I can say: The tents and the pavilions, armour and rich array, And horses without number running wide astray; Many became a prize to the native peasants round, Yet, for the fifth part of the whole, there were fifteen hundred found (The Cid's own proper portion) horses strong and sound. The rest with their allotments were joyous and content, From many a proud pavilion and many a costly tent, Enriched with silken hangings and golden ornament. The great imperial tent, that in the centre stood, It rested on two pillars of gold and sandal wood; It is ordered to be left untouch'd, perfect and entire. “I mean it as a present for our own Lord and sire; “When the King receives it no courtier will refuse “To credit our successes or cavil at the news.” Now to Valencia they return with a store of wealth in hold. The Bishop Don Jeronimo, like a worthy priest and bold, Was fairly wearied out and glutted with delight, With a sword in either hand striking to left and right, No man could reckon up or guess the numbers he had slain; For his own portion he received the largest share of gain. The Cid from his own fifth presented him the tithe— Thus all were joyous in the town confident and blythe. V. ARGUMENT. After the route of King Yusef and his army, the Cid sends Alvar Fanez and Pero Bermudez with King Yusef's tent and a present of two hundred horses to King Alfonso, because the king had sent his wife and daughters when he asked for them, and because of the honour which he had done them. The king, when he saw the present, said that never had so goodly a present been sent before to a king of Spain by his vassals, and desired Alvar Fanez and Pero Bermudez, when they took their leave, to tell the Cid that he had a great desire to see him. The meeting was appointed upon the Tagus. When it took place, the king, at the previous instigation of the Infants (whose family were his old adversaries) asked the Cid to give his daughters in marriage to the Infants of Carrion. The Cid in reply consents to place his daughters “at the disposition of the King.” The wedding is celebrated at Valencia with the greatest possible splendour, and the two young Counts remain at Valencia with their father-in-law: their situation, however, is an invidious one; some occasions arise in which their courage appears doubtful, and the prudence and authority of the Cid are found insufficient to suppress the contemptuous mirth of his military court. Accordingly they enter into the resolution of leaving Valencia, but determining at the same time to execute a project of the basest and most unmanly revenge, they request of the Cid to be allowed to take their brides with them upon a journey to Carrion, under pretence of making them acquainted with the property which had been settled upon them at their marriage. The Cid is aware that their situation is an uneasy one; he readily consents, takes leave of them with great cordiality, loads them with presents, and at their departure bestows upon them the two celebrated swords, Colada and Tison. The Infants pursue their journey till they arrive in a wilderness, where they dismiss their followers, and being left alone with their brides, proceed to execute their scheme of vengeance by stripping them and “mangling them with spurs and thongs,” till they leave them without signs of life: in this state they are found by a relation of the Cid's, Felez Munioz, who, suspecting some evil design, had followed them at a distance. They are brought back to Valencia. The Cid demands justice. The King assembles the Cortes upon the occasion. The Cid, being called upon to state his grievances, confines himself to the claim of the two swords which he had given to his sons-in-law, and which he now demands back since they have forfeited their character. The swords are restored without hesitation, and the Cid immediately bestows them upon two of his champions. He then rises again, and upon the same plea requires the restitution of the gifts and treasures with which he had honoured his sons-in-law at parting. This claim is resisted by his opponents: the Cortes, however, decide in favour of the Cid, and as the Infants plead their immediate inability, it is determined that the property which they have with them shall be taken at an appraisement. This is accordingly done. The Cid then rises a third time, and demands satisfaction for the insult which his daughters had suffered: an altercation arises, in the course of which the Infants of Carrion and one of their partisans are challenged by three champions on the part of the Cid. From line 3254 to 3401. Within a little space There was many a noble courser brought into the place, Many a lusty mule with palfreys stout and sure, And many a goodly sword with all its furniture. The Cid received them all at an appraisement made, Besides two hundred marks that to the King were paid: The Infants give up all they have, their goods are at an end, They go about in haste to their kindred and their friend; They borrow as they can, but all will scarce suffice; The attendants of the Cid take each thing at a price: But as soon as this was ended, he began a new device. “Justice and mercy, my Lord the King, I beseech you of your grace! “I have yet a grievance left behind which nothing can efface. “Let all men present in the court attend and judge the case, “Listen to what these Counts have done and pity my disgrace. “Dishonour'd as I am, I cannot be so base, “But here, before I leave them, to defy them to their face. “Say, Infants, how had I deserved, in earnest or in jest, “Or on whatever plea you can defend it best, “That you should rend and tear the heartstrings from my breast? “I gave you at Valencia my daughters in your hand, “I gave you wealth and honours and treasure at command; “Had you been weary of them, to cover your neglect, “You might have left them with me in honour and respect. “Why did you take them from me, dogs and traitors as you were? “In the forest of Corpes, why did you strip them there “Why did you mangle them with whips? why did you leave them bare “To the vultures and the wolves, and to the wintry air? “The court will hear your answer and judge what you have done. “I say, your name and honour henceforth are lost and gone.” The Count Don Garcia was the first to rise: “We crave your favour, my Lord the King, you are always just and wise; “The Cid is come to your Court in such an uncouth guise, “He has left his beard to grow and tied it in a braid, “We are half of us astonish'd, the other half afraid. “The blood of the Counts of Carrion is of too high a line “To take a daughter from his house, though it were for a concubine. “A concubine or a leman from the lineage of the Cid, “They could have done no other than leave them as they did. “We neither care for what he says nor fear what he may threat.” With that the noble Cid rose up from his seat: He took his beard in his hand, “If this beard is fair and even, “I must thank the Lord above, who made both earth and heaven; “It has been cherish'd with respect and therefore it has thriven: “It never suffered an affront since the day it first was worn. “What business, Count, have you to speak of it with scorn? “It never yet was shaken, nor pluck'd away nor torn, “By Christian nor by Moor, nor by man of woman born, “As yours was once, Sir Count, the day Cabra was taken; “When I was master of Cabra that beard of yours was shaken; “There was never a footboy in my camp but twitch'd away a bit: “The side that I tore off grows all uneven yet.” Ferran Gonzales started upon the floor, He cried with a loud voice, “Cid, let us hear no more, “Your claim for goods and money was satisfied before: “Let not a feud arise betwixt our friends and you, “We are the Counts of Carrion, from them our birth we drew. “Daughters of Emperors or Kings were a match for our degree, “We hold ourselves too good for a baron's such as thee. “If we abandon'd, as you say, and left and gave them o'er, “We vouch that we did right, and prize ourselves the more.” The Cid look'd at Bermuez, that was sitting at his foot; “Speak thou, Peter the Dumb, what ails thee to sit mute? “My daughters and thy nieces are the parties in dispute. “Stand forth and make reply, if you would do them right. “If I should rise to speak, you cannot hope to fight.” Peter Bermuez rose, somewhat he had to say, The words were strangled in his throat, they could not find their way; Till forth they came at once, without a stop or stay: “Cid, I'll tell you what, this always is your way, “You have always served me thus, whenever we have come “To meet here in the Cortes, you call me Peter the Dumb. “I cannot help my nature; I never talk nor rail; “But when a thing is to be done, you know I never fail. “Fernando, you have lied, you have lied in every word: “You have been honour'd by the Cid, and favour'd and preferr'd. “I know of all your tricks, and can tell them to your face: “Do you remember in Valencia the skirmish and the chase? “You ask'd leave of the Cid to make the first attack: “You went to meet a Moor, but you soon came running back. “I met the Moor and kill'd him, or he would have kill'd you; “I gave you up his arms, and all that was my due. “Up to this very hour I never said a word. “You praised yourself before the Cid, and I stood by and heard, “How you had kill'd the Moor, and done a valiant act, “And they believed you all, but they never knew the fact. “You are tall enough and handsome, but cowardly and weak. “Thou tongue without a hand, how can you dare to speak? “There's the story of the lion should never be forgot. “Now let us hear, Fernando, what answer have you got? “The Cid was sleeping in his chair, with all his knights around, “The cry went forth along the hall, that the lion was unbound,— “What did you do, Fernando? like a coward as you were, “You slunk behind the Cid, and crouch'd beneath his chair. “We prest around the throne to shield our Lord from harm, “Till the good Cid awoke; he rose without alarm; “He went to meet the lion with his mantle on his arm; “The lion was abash'd the noble Cid to meet, “He bow'd his mane to the earth, his muzzle at his feet. “The Cid by the neck and mane drew him to his den, “He thrust him in at the hatch, and came to the hall again: “He found his knights, his vassals, and all his valiant men; “He ask'd for his sons-in-law, they were neither of them there. “I defy you for a coward and a traitor as you are; “For the daughters of the Cid you have done them great unright, “In the wrong that they have suffer'd you stand dishonour'd quite. “Although they are but women, and each of you a knight, “I hold them worthier far; and here my word I plight, “Before the King Alfonso, upon this plea to fight. “If it be God his will, before the battle part, “Thou shalt avow it with thy mouth, like a traitor as thou art.” Uprose Diego Gonzales and answer'd as he stood: “By our lineage we are Counts, and of the purest blood; “This match was too unequal, it never could hold good; “For the daughters of the Cid we acknowledge no regret, “We leave them to lament the chastisement they met. “It will follow them through life for a scandal and a jest. “I stand upon this plea to combat with the best, “That having left them as we did, our honour is increased.” Uprose Martin Antolinez when Diego ceased: “Peace, thou lying mouth! thou traitor coward, Peace! “The story of the lion should have taught you shame at least: “You rush'd out at the door, and ran away so hard, “You fell into the cesspool that was open in the yard. “We dragg'd you forth in all men's sight, dripping from the drain; “For shame, never wear a mantle, nor a knightly robe again! “I fight upon this plea without more ado; “The daughters of the Cid are worthier far than you. “Before the combat part you shall avow it true, “And that you have been a traitor and a coward too.” Thus was ended the parley and challenge betwixt these two. Assur Gonzales was entering at the door With his ermine mantle trailing along the floor; With his sauntering pace and his hardy look, Of manners or of courtesy little heed he took: He was flush'd and hot with breakfast and with drink. “What ho, my masters, your spirits seem to sink! “Have we no news stirring from the Cid Ruy Diaz of Bivar? “Has he been to Riodivirna to besiege the windmills there? “Does he tax the millers for their toll, or is that practice past? “Will he make a match for his daughters another like the last?” Munio Gustioz rose and made reply: “Traitor! wilt thou never cease to slander and to lie? “You breakfast before mass, you drink before you pray: “There is no honour in your heart, nor truth in what you say; “You cheat your comrade and your Lord, you flatter to betray: “Your hatred I despise, your friendship I defy. “False to all mankind, and most to God on high. “I shall force you to confess that what I say is true.” Thus was ended the parley and challenge betwixt these two. VI. ARGUMENT. The King suppresses all further altercation, and declares that those only who have already challenged shall be permitted to fight. The time and place are fixed. The Cid being obliged to return to Valencia, leaves his Champions under the protection of the King. The Cid takes leave of the King. At the end of three weeks the combat is fought, and the three Champions of the Cid are victorious. From line 3516 to 3702. I crave your favour, My Lord the King, since things are settled so; “I have business at Valencia, and thither I must go. “Before the town was conquer'd it cost me pains enow.” The King lift up his hand, made a cross upon his brow: “I swear by St. Isidro, the patron of Leon, “In all my realm beside there is not such a good baron.” The Cid leapt on his steed and rode him round the course, He came up to the King and proffer'd him the horse— “'Tis the noble Babieca that is famed for speed and force, “Among the Christians nor the Moors there is not such another one; “My Sovereign Lord and Sire, he is fit for you alone: “Give orders to your people, and take him for your own.” The King replied, “It cannot be; Cid, you shall keep your horse, “He must not leave his master, nor change him for a worse; “The man that would take him from you, evil may he speed, “Our kingdom has been honour'd by you and by your steed. “A courser such as he is fit for such a knight, “To beat down Moors in battle, and follow them in flight.” Now they have taken leave, and broken up the Court, The Cid goes with his champions to advise them and exhort: “You, Martin Antolinez, and Pero Bermuez, you, “And you, Munio Gustioz, be valiant men and true: “When I am gone to Valencia let me have good tidings there.” Martin Antolinez replied, “Sir, what needs this care? “We are pledged in your behalf, we must do our best endeavour; “You may hear that we are dead, but defeated never.” The Cid was joyful at the word, and quitted them anon; He has taken leave of all his friends, and shortly he is gone. The Cid goes to Valencia, the King to Carrion. Three weeks had been appointed, and now they are past away, The champions of the Cid are ready at the day: They are ready in the field to defend their master's right, The noble King is with them, to protect them with his might. They waited in the place for two days and a night, Behold the Lords of Carrion where they appear in sight: They are coming with an host of their kindred and their clan, With horses and with arms, and many a valiant man; If they could meet with them apart, or take them unaware, In dishonour of the Cid to have slain his champions there. The thought was foul and evil, but yet they did not dare, For fear of the King Alfonso that had them in his care. That night they watch'd their arms, and past the hours in prayer; The night is past and over, the day begins to break; Great was the throng of folk who, for that battle's sake, Flock'd in on every side, assembled for the fight, And many a man of arms and many a wealthy knight. There is the King Alfonso with all his power and might, To keep down force and wrong, and to defend the right. The champions of the Cid are all of good accord, They are arming themselves together, like vassals of one Lord. The Infants of Carrion are arming themselves apart, Count Garcia sits advising them, and keeps them in good heart. They bring a plea before the King, and they pretend a right, That those two trenchant swords should not be used in fight, The swords Colada and Tizon, which the Cid's champions wore; They repent of their imprudence when they gave them up before. They were earnest in their plea, but they could not succeed; “You might have kept them for yourselves to serve you in your need; “If you have other good ones, make use of them instead. “Infants of Carrion! hear me and take heed: “You must approve your honour by some manly deed. “Go forth into the field, and show a valiant heart, “For nothing will be wanting upon the Champions' part. “If you are conquerors in the fight you will purchase great renown, “If you are beaten and disgraced, the fault will be your own, “For this business was your seeking, as has been seen and shown.” The Infants of Carrion are beginning to repent; The Lordship of Carrion with its honours and its rent, Its mansion and its lands, they would have given all, Could they command the past, to redeem it and recall. The Champions of the Cid, clad in their warlike weed, The King is gone to see them and wish them well to speed. “Sir, we kiss your hands as our good Lord and sire, “To have you judge and umpire is all that we require. “Defend us in all right, assist us not in wrong; “The friends of the Lords of Carrion are numerous and strong, “We cannot guess their counsels, nor how they will behave. “To the good Cid, our master, the promise that you gave, “To defend us and protect us, this, Sir, is all we crave, “So long as right and justice are found upon our part.” “That will I,” said the King, “with all my soul and heart.” Their horses are brought up to them, coursers strong and fleet, They sign their saddles with the cross, and leap into the seat; Their shields are hanging at their necks with bosses broad and sheen, They take their lances in their hands, the points are bright and keen, A pennon at each lance, the staves were large and stout, And many a valiant man encompass'd them about. They rode forth to the field where the barriers were set out. The Champions of the Cid are agreed upon their plan, To fight as they had challenged, and each to charge his man. There come the Lords of Carrion with their kindred and their clan; The King has appointed heralds for avoiding all debate, He spoke aloud amongst them in the field there where they sate. “Infants of Carrion! Attend to what I say: “You should have fought this battle upon a former day, “When we were at Toledo, but you would not agree; “And now the noble Cid has sent these Champions three, “To fight in the lands of Carrion, escorted here by me. “Be valiant in your right, attempt no force or wrong; “If any man attempt it he shall not triumph long: “He never shall have rest or peace within my kingdom more.” The Infants of Carrion are now repenting sore; The heralds and the King are foremost in the place, They clear away the people from the middle space: They measure out the lists, the barriers they fix: They point them out in order, and explain to all the six: “If you are forced beyond the line where they are fixt and traced, “You shall be held as conquer'd, and beaten and disgraced.” Six lances' length on either side an open space is laid, They part the field between them, the sunshine and the shade. Their office is perform'd, and from the middle space, The heralds are withdrawn, and leave them face to face. Here stood the warriors of the Cid, that noble champion, Opposite on the other side, the Lords of Carrion. Earnestly their minds are fixt each upon his foe; Face to face they take their place; anon the trumpets blow. They stir their horses with the spur, they lay their lances low, They bend their shields before their breasts, their face to the saddle bow. Earnestly their minds are fixt each upon his foe. The heavens are overcast above, the earth trembles below, The people stand in silence, gazing on the show: Bermuez the first challenger first in combat closed, He met Ferran Gonzales, face to face opposed; They rush together with such rage that all men count them dead, They strike each other on the shield, without all fear or dread. Ferran Gonzales with his lance pierced the shield outright, It past Bermuez on the left side, in his flesh it did not bite. The spear was snapt in twain, Bermuez sat upright, He neither flinch'd nor swerved, like a true stedfast knight, A good stroke he received, but a better he has given; He struck the shield upon the boss, in sunder it is riven. Onward into Ferran's breast the lance's point is driven, Full upon his breastplate, nothing would avail; Two breastplates Fernando wore and a coat of mail: The two are riven in sunder, the third stood him in stead, The mail sunk in his breast, the mail and the spear head, The blood burst from his mouth that all men thought him dead. The blow has broken his girdle and his saddle girth, It has taken him over his horse's back, and borne him to the earth. The people think him dead, as he lies on the sand; Bermuez left his lance and took his sword in hand. Ferran Gonzales knew the blade which he had worn of old, Before the blow came down, he yielded and cried, “Hold!” Antolinez and Diego encounter'd man for man, Their spears were shiver'd with the shock, so eagerly they ran. Antolinez drew forth the blade which Diego once had worn, Eagerly he aim'd the blow for the vengeance he had sworn. Right through Diego's helm the blade its edge has borne, The crest and helm are lopt away, the coif and hair are shorn. He stood astounded with the stroke, trembling and forlorn, He waved his sword above his head, he made a piteous cry, “O save me, save me from that blade, Almighty Lord on high!” Antolinez came fiercely round to reach the fatal stroke, Diego's courser rear'd upright, and through the barrier broke. Antolinez has won the day, though his blow he miss'd, He has driven Diego from the field, and stands within the list. I must tell you of Munio Gustioz, two combats now are done; How he fought with Assur Gonzales, you shall hear anon. Assur Gonzales, a fierce and hardy knight, He rode at Munio Gustioz with all his force and might; He struck the shield and pierced it through, but the point came wide, It pass'd by Munio Gustioz, betwixt his arm and side: Sternly, like a practised knight, Munio met him there. His lance he levell'd stedfastly, and through the shield him bare; He bore the point into his breast, a little beside the heart; It took him through the body, but in no mortal part; The shaft stood out behind his back a cloth-yard and more; The pennon and the point were dripping down with gore. Munio still clench'd his spear, as he pass'd he forced it round, He wrench'd him from the saddle, and cast him to the ground. His horse sprung forward with the spur, he pluck'd the spear away, He wheel'd and came again to pierce him where he lay. Then cried Gonzalo Asurez, “For God's sake spare my son! “The other two have yielded, the field is fought and won.” MISCELLANEOUS TRANSLATIONS.

Firm and fond, far far beyond The best of woman-kind that have been ever; Whilst here on earth above, Thy constant worth and love, Shall form the theme of emulous endeavour, Wherever minstrels sing—or where they strike the string: Whether in Sparta's ancient state austere, When the revolving year Brings round the high Karneian festival, And the moon's awful and full orbed ball, Fills and illumines all: Or where proud Athens hails the festive day, With pomp and art and prosperous display. HERCULES FURENS. ?? ?? ????????, ?.?.?. —l. 855. The Demon of Madness is represented as having a certain feeling of justice and right, averse to exercising her power, but at the same time having a pleasure in it. She has been remonstrating with Iris, who answers: Iris. Don't remonstrate, Juno's order justifies you, never fear, You've a warrant for your errand, and you come, commission'd here, For a sudden execution, not to parley and debate. Lissa. Heaven and earth I call to witness. I protest and invocate, Every power that sees and hears us, and the sun's all-viewing eye, To record that, as a vassal, on compulsion I comply. Since the fates have so decreed it, and you bring me tied and bound, Train'd to chase the prey before me, like a huntsman with a hound, Here I go then!—Nor the tempest, nor the deep earth quaking shock, Nor the speed of angry lightning, nor the bolt that splits the rock, With a fiercer haste and heat shall hurry than shall I to seize, And overturn and storm the breast and brain of Hercules. First, I mean to slay the children, nor shall he—the father—he, Know the deed his hands are doing, 'till I leave his spirit free. —Now the storm begins to shake him—life and death are in debate,— —Look before you—there! behold him—low'ring at the palace gate— Mark the turn his eyes are taking—and the forehead, bending low, Breathing hard and angry like the bull that meditates a blow— Invocating earth and hell, and all the dreary powers below. There you stand entranced and idle! I shall rouse and shake ye soon— Hand in hand, a surly partner dancing to a bloody tune. —Iris, hence! to fair Olympus, speed aloft your airy flight.— I proceed within the palace—creeping onward out of sight. FROM EMPEDOCLES. ???? ????????.—Frag. 77 &amp; 78. ? ????? ?? ???? ????, ?.?.?. Friends! kinsmen! inmates of the noble town, Whose rocky-planted turrets guard and crown Old Agrigentum's memorable seat; Famous for courteous cheer and converse sweet, My fellow-citizens!—I greet you well: Within your gentle precincts here I dwell, An earthly sojourner, but honoured more Than ever human mortal was before, Even as a visible Deity; with a crown, With garlands and with fillets falling down, With such a pomp of ornament, I meet Your daily gaze, and move along the street. When to the neighbouring city, as befals, My progress leads me, far without the walls, The multitude flock forth and crowd the way, Men, women, old and young, in long array, Eager in admiration or concern, To know, what it imports them most to learn, Of omens, expiations, prophecies, Or politic advisements, deep and wise, Or means of public safety for defence Against the wasting power of pestilence— Oh, poor pre-eminence! how mean! how base! Amidst this earthly, transitory race, To boast of worldly power, or name, or place. FROM CATULLUS. Carm. III.—Lugete, o Veneres, &amp;c. Ye Venuses and Cupids all, And all polite, well-bred, Ingenious persons, hear my call! My lady's sparrow,—he is dead, And therefore you must drop a tear: He was so nice a little dear— Such a darling, such a love; Round the room, about, above, He used to flutter and to hurry,— Then he came, in such a flurry, Flying to my lady's breast, Lodging in it like a nest, Like an infant with a mother; He would not leave her for another; He would not move, he would not stir, Nor chirp for any, but for her. And now, they say, that he must go, For ever, to the shades below, Where not a creature, I can learn, Was ever suffered to return. O nasty, spiteful, ugly death, To be so peevish and absurd,— To take that dear, delightful bird, Down to your odious shades beneath; O dismal and unhappy case,— Poor Lesbia's eyes and lovely face Are flush'd with weeping, vex'd and red, Since her unlucky bird is dead. Carm. IV.—Phaselus ille, &amp;c. Stranger, the bark you see before you says, That in old times, and in her early days, She was a lively vessel that could make The quickest voyages, and overtake All her competitors with sail or oar; And she defies the rude Illyrian shore, And Rhodes, with her proud harbour, and the seas That intersect the scatter'd Cyclades, And the Propontic and the Thracian coast, (Bold as it is) to contradict her boast. She calls to witness the dark Euxine sea, And mountains that had known her as a tree, Before her transformation, when she stood A native of the deep Cytorian wood, Where all her ancestors had flourish'd long, And, with their old traditionary song, Had whisper'd her responses to the breeze, And waked the chorus of her sister trees. Amastris! from your haven forth she went, You witness'd her first outset and descent, Adventuring on an unknown element. From thence she bore her master safe and free From danger and alarm, through many a sea; Nor ever once was known to lag behind, Foremost on every tack, with every wind At last, to this fair inland lake, she says She came to pass the remnant of her days, Leaving no debt due to the Deities, For vows preferr'd in danger on the seas: Clear of incumbrance, therefore, and all other Contentious claims, to Castor or his brother, As a free gift and offering she devotes Herself, as long as she survives and floats. Carm. X.—Varus me meus, &amp;c. Varus, whom I chanced to meet The other evening in the street, Engaged me there, upon the spot, To see a mistress he had got. She seem'd, as far as I can gather, Lively and smart, and handsome rather. There, as we rested from our walk, We enter'd into different talk— As how much might Bithynia bring? And had I found it a good thing? I answer'd, as it was the fact, The province had been stript and sack'd; That there was nothing for the prætors, And still less for us wretched creatures, His poor companions and toad-eaters. At least, says she, you bought some fellows To bear your litter; for they tell us, Our only good ones come from there— I chose to give myself an air; Why, truly with my poor estate, The difference wasn't quite so great Betwixt a province, good or bad, That where a purchase could be had, Eight lusty fellows, straight and tall, I shouldn't find the wherewithal To buy them. But it was a lie; For not a single wretch had I— No single cripple fit to bear A broken bedstead or a chair. She, like a strumpet, pert and knowing, Said—“Dear Catullus, I am going “To worship at Serapis' shrine— Do lend me, pray, those slaves of thine!” I answer'd—It was idly said,— They were a purchase Cinna made (Caius Cinna, my good friend)— It was the same thing in the end, Whether a purchase or a loan— I always used them as my own; Only the phrase was inexact— He bought them for himself, in fact. But you have caught the general vice Of being too correct and nice, Over curious and precise; And seizing with precipitation The slight neglects of conversation. Carm. XXXI.—Peninsularum Sirmio, &amp;c. Of all the famous isles and promontories, From the sun's up-rise to his setting glories, Of all that Neptune's liquid arms surround, In oceans or in midland waters found, The fairest and the best, to thee I call— Sirmio, the gem and jewel of them all. How gladly I revisit and review Thy wonted scenes, and scarce believe it true, After so long a journey, past and o'er, From Hellespont and the Bithynian shore, To find myself amidst your walks once more. How sweet it is to lay aside the load Of foreign cares within one's own abode, And with free heart and unencumber'd head, To couch ourselves in our accustom'd bed; That single moment overpays our pain— Sweet Sirmio receive me once again, And with thy smiles, thy old possessor greet, And ye, fair waters of the Lydian Lake, Salute me with such mirth as ye can make, And roll your laughing billows at my feet. Let all be glad and cheerful for my sake. 1805. Carm. XXXIX.—Egnatius quod candidos, &amp;c. Egnatius has a certain pride that centres In his white teeth; he smiles at all adventures: He goes, like other people, to attend And countenance the trial of a friend: The orator insists and perseveres; The audience and judges are in tears; When in the midst of his pathetic style, Egnatius sympathises with a smile. Following a widow to the funeral pile Of her last child, he cannot choose but smile: Without a thought of person, time, or place, He wears a constant smile upon his face: In business, in distress, in haste, in sadness, It looks like a disease, a kind of madness: (Though not a witty madness or refined)— A madness in degree, though not in kind, And therefore all his friends must speak their mind. —My dear Egnatius, if your birth had been At Tiber, Rome, or in the space between; Were you a Susian fat or Umbrian poor, A Volscian, or a Lanuvinian boor, Sharp-tooth'd and eager at his meals and labours; Or a Cisalpine, like my friends and neighbours; Of any nation, tribe, or race, in short, That scour their teeth and gums in cleanly sort, I still should disapprove that constant smile, It shows a silly, poor, affected style.— But in his native Celtiberian land, Your Celtiberian, as we understand, Time out of mind, cleanseth his jaws and bone, Each for himself, with urine of his own, Reserved and hoarded from the day before; And therefore, calculated on that score, The whiteness of your teeth seems to imply A steady, copious use of chamber-lye. 1810. Carm. LXI.—Collis o Heliconei, &amp;c. I You that from the mother's side, Lead the lingering, blushing bride, Fair Urania's son— Leave awhile the lonely mount, The haunted grove and holy fount Of chilling Helicon. II With myrtle wreaths enweave thy hair— Wave the torch aloft in air— Make no long delay: With flowing robe and footsteps light, And gilded buskins glancing bright, Hither bend thy way. III Join at once, with airy vigour, In the dance's varied figure, To the cymbal's chime: Frolic unrestrain'd and free— Let voice, and air, and verse agree, And the torch beat time. IV Hymen come, for Julia Weds with Manlius to-day, And deigns to be a bride. Such a form as Venus wore In the contest famed of yore, On Mount Ida's side; V Like the myrtle or the bay, Florid, elegant, and gay, With foliage fresh and new; Which the nymphs and forest maids Have foster'd in sequester'd shades, With drops of holy dew. VI Leave, then, all the rocks and cells Of the deep Aonian dells, And the caverns hoar; And the dreary streams that weep From the stony Thespian steep, Dripping evermore. VII Haste away to new delights, To domestic happy rites, Human haunts and ways; With a kindly charm applied, Soften and appease the bride, And shorten our delays. VIII Bring her hither, bound to move, Drawn and led with bands of love, Like the tender twine Which the searching ivy plies, Clinging in a thousand ties O'er the clasping vine. IX Gentle virgins, you besides, Whom the like event betides, With the coming year; Call on Hymen! call him now! Call aloud! A virgin vow Best befits his ear. X “Is there any deity “More beloved and kind than he— “More disposed to bless; “Worthy to be worshipp'd more; “Master of a richer store, “Of wealth and happiness? XI “Youth and age alike agree, “Serving and adoring thee, “The source of hope and care: “Care and hope alike engage “The wary parent sunk in age “And the restless heir. XII “She the maiden, half afraid, “Hears the new proposal made, “That proceeds from Thee; “You resign and hand her over “To the rash and hardy lover “With a fixt decree. XIII “Hymen, Hymen, you preside, “Maintaining honour and the pride “Of women free from blame, “With a solemn warrant given, “Is there any power in heaven “That can do the same? XIV “Love, accompanied by thee, “Passes unreproved and free, “But without thee, not: “Where on earth, or in the sky, “Can you find a deity “With a fairer lot? XV “Heirship in an honour'd line “Is sacred as a gift of thine, “But without thee, not: “Where on earth, or in the sky, “Can you find a deity “With a fairer lot? XVI “Rule and empire—royalty, “Are rightful, as derived from thee, “But without thee, not: “Where on earth, or in the sky, “Can you find a deity “With a fairer lot?” XVII Open locks! unbar the gate! Behold the ready troop that wait The coming of the bride; Behold the torches, how they flare! Spreading aloft their sparkling hair, Flashing far and wide. XVIII Lovely maiden! here we waste The timely moments;—Come in haste! Come then. . . . Out, alack! Startled at the glare and din, She retires to weep within, Lingering, hanging back. XIX Bashful honour and regret, For a while detain her yet, Lingering, taking leave: Taking leave and lingering still, With a slow, reluctant will, With grief that does not grieve. XX Aurunculeia, cease your tears, And when to-morrow's morn appears, Fear not that the sun Will dawn upon a fairer face,— Nor in his airy, lofty race Behold a lovelier one. XXI “Mark and hear us, gentle bride; “Behold the torches nimbly plied, Waving here and there; “Along the street and in the porch, “See the fiery tressed torch, “Spreads its sparkling hair. XXII “Like a lily, fair and chaste, “Lovely bride, you shall be placed “In a garden gay, “A wealthy lord's delight and pride; “Come away then, happy bride, “Hasten, hence away! XXIII “Mark and hear us—he your Lord, “Will be true at bed and board, “Nor ever walk astray, “Withdrawing from your lovely side; “Mark and hear us, gentle bride, “Hasten, hence away! XXIV “Like unto the tender vine, “He shall ever clasp and twine, “Clinging night and day, “Fairly bound and firmly tied; “Come away then, happy bride, “Hasten, hence away! XXV Happy chamber, happy bed, Can the joys be told or said That await you soon; Fresh renewals of delight, In the silent fleeting night And the summer noon. XXVI Make ready. There I see within The bride is veiled; the guests begin To muster close and slow: Trooping onward close about, Boys, be ready with a shout— “Hymen! Hymen! Ho!” XXVII Now begins the free career,— For many a jest and many a jeer, And many a merry saw; Customary taunts and gibes, Such as ancient use prescribes, And immemorial law. XXVIII “Some at home, it must be feared, “Will be slighted and cashiered, “Pride will have a fall; “Now the favourites' reign is o'er, “Proud enough they were before,— “Proud and nice withal. XXIX “Full of pride and full of scorn, Now you see them clipt and shorn, “Humbler in array; “Sent away, for fear of harm, “To the village or the farm,— “Packed in haste away. XXX “Other doings must be done, “Another empire is begun, “Behold your own domain! “Gentle bride! Behold it there! “The lordly palace proud and fair:— “You shall live and reign, XXXI “In that rich and noble house, “Till age shall silver o'er the brows, “And nod the trembling head, “Not regarding what is meant, “Incessant uniform assent, “To all that's done or said. XXXII “Let the faithful threshold greet, “With omens fair, those lovely feet, “Lightly lifted o'er; “Let the garlands wave and bow “From the lofty lintel's brow “That bedeck the door.” XXXIII See the couch with crimson dress— Where, seated in the deep recess, With expectation warm, The bridegroom views her coming near,— The slender youth that led her here May now release her arm. XXXIV With a fixt intense regard He beholds her close and hard In awful interview: Shortly now she must be sped To the chamber and the bed, With attendance due. XXXV Let the ancient worthy wives, That have past their constant lives With a single mate, As befits advised age, With council and precaution sage Assist and regulate. XXXVI She the mistress of the band Comes again with high command, “Bridegroom, go your way; “There your bride is in the bower, “Like a lovely lily flower, “Or a rose in May. XXXIX “Ay, and you yourself in truth, “Are a goodly comely youth, “Proper, tall, and fair; “Venus and the Graces too, “Have befriended each of you “For a lovely pair. XL “There you go! may Venus bless, “Such as you with good success “In the lawful track; “You that, in an honest way, “Purchase in the face of day, “Whatsoe'er you lack.” XLI Sport your fill and never spare— Let us have an infant heir Of the noble name; Such a line should ever last, As it has for ages past, Another and the same. XLII Fear not! with the coming year, The new Torquatus will be here, Him we soon shall see With infant gesture fondly seek To reach his father's manly cheek, From his mother's knee. XLIII With laughing eyes and dewy lip, Pouting like the purple tip That points the rose's bud; While mingled with the mother's grace, Strangers shall recognise the trace That marks the Manlian blood. XLIV So the mother's fair renown Shall betimes adorn and crown The child with dignity, As we read in stories old Of Telemachus the bold, And chaste Penelope. XLV Now the merry task is o'er Let us hence and close the door, While loud adieus are paid; “Live in honour, love and truth, “And exercise your lusty youth, “In matches fairly played.” Carm. XCI.—Non ideo Gelli, &amp;c. Gellius, it never once was my design, In all that wretched, tedious love of mine, To treat you as a worthy man or just, Alive to shame, susceptible of trust, In word or act true, faithful, or sincere; But since that idol which my heart held dear Was not your sister, niece, or near of kin, The slight inducement of so small a sin As broken faith to a confiding friend, Would scarce, methought, allure you to descend From those proud heights of wickedness sublime— Giant ambition that aspires to climb The topmost pinnacles of human guilt:— —To make the mistress of your friend a jilt Appear'd too poor a triumph. I was blind To that perpetual relish which you find In crimes of all degrees and every kind. TRANSLATION FROM LOPE DE VEGA. Madre unos ojuelos vi Nigros alegres y bellos, &amp;c. Such a pair of black eyes as I saw yesterday— So lively, so sparkling, so gentle and gay! Dear mother, such things they were seeming to say; They so taunted and teazed betwixt earnest and play: They gave me such pleasure, so mingled with pain, And oh! I am dying to see them again! Lisbon, 1802. FROM THE SPANISH OF GONZALO DE BERCEO. Vida de San Millan, Stanzas 57, 63-65, 77 and 78. He walk'd those mountains wild, and lived within that nook For forty years and more, nor ever comfort took Of offer'd food or alms, or human speech or look; No other saint in Spain did such a penance brook. And there I saw, myself, for so the chance befell, Upon the mountain ledge, beside a springing well, A hermitage of stone, a chapel and a cell,— It is not yet destroy'd; he built it, as they tell. For many a painful year he pass'd the seasons there, And many a night consumed in penitence and prayer— In solitude and cold, with want and evil fare, His thoughts to God resign'd, and free from human care. Oh, sacred is that place, the fountain and the hill, The rocks where he reposed, in meditation still; The solitary shades, through which he roved at will, His presence all that place with sanctity did fill. In every act a saint, in life's every feature, Of controverted points no teacher or repeater; Call'd by the voice of God, from the first hand of nature, From childhood to his end, a pure and holy creature. In such guise as he could, and in such poor array, Where or whence he had it, in truth, I cannot say, He came down from the hills, and went forth on his way, The road across the plain, to where the city lay. There, leaning on his staff, he enter'd in the town, His eyes upon the earth, his forehead bending down; His beard was deep and large, his locks all overgrown, So strange and rude a form they ne'er had seen anon. FROM THE “DIANA” OF MONTE MAYOR. Murio mi Madre en pariendo Moça hermosa y mal lograda. El ama que me dio leche, Jamas tuvo dicha en nada, &amp;c. My mother died to give me life— I was born in sorrowing; The very nurse that tended me Was a poor ill-fated thing. So have I been all my life, In courtship and in marrying: Love, so seeming sweet at first, Left behind a secret sting; Sirens plighted me his faith, And went, forsooth, to serve the king; My father gave me to a churl, For such wealth as he could bring. Would he had given me to the grave, With a shroud instead of a wedding-ring! Jealousy couches by my side, From bed-time to the fair morning. When I wake he watches me; When I rise he is on the wing— Jealousy pursues my path, To the fold and to the spring. Jealousy besets me so, That I can neither laugh nor sing: I can neither look nor speak For fear of false interpreting. His countenance is never gay, Always sour and threatening; His looks still peering on one side— No voice but angry muttering; If I ask him what he ails, He never answers anything. TRANSLATION OF THE “ROMANCE DEL REY DE ARAGON.” Miraba de Campo Veijo, El Rey de Aragon un dia, &amp;c. The King of Aragon look'd down From Campo Veijo, where he stood, And he beheld the Sea of Spain, Both the ebb-tide and the flood. He saw the gallies and the ships— How some set sail and others enter; Some were sailing on a cruize, And others on a merchant's venture. Some were sailing to Lombardy, And some to Flanders, far away: And, oh, how bright were the ships of war, With swelling sails and streamers gay! He saw the city that spread below— Royal Naples, that noble town! And the three castles, how they stood, On the great city looking down: The new castle and the Capuan, And St. Elmo, far the best— Like the sun at the noon day, It shone so bright above the rest. The King stood silent for a while, He gazed and wept at his own thought— Oh, Naples, thou'rt a princely purchase, But thou hast been dearly bought! Many brave and loyal captains You had cost, e'er you were won; Besides a dear and valiant brother, Whom I grieved for like a son,— Knights and gallant gentlemen, Whose like I ne'er shall see again, Of soldiers and of other subjects, Many, many thousands slain; Two-and-twenty years you cost me, The best of my life that are pass'd away; For here this beard began to grow, And here it has been turn'd to grey. Madrid, 1804. LINES WRITTEN AFTER VISITING THE MONASTERIES AT CATANIA. “Li Beati singulari Son poi mi di Regolari Va vidite a Le Cunventi, Ca su tutti ben contenti.” —Vivu Mortu. Monks and holy clerks profest Lead the sweetest and the best, The securest life of all. Look within the convent wall, See the countenances there Unannoy'd by worldly care, Unaffected happy faces, With the features and the traces Of habitual tranquillity: With the joyous affability That bespeaks a heart and head, Undisturb'd at board and bed, Studious hours and holy rites, Occupy their days and nights; Study, learning, and devotion, Leading onward to promotion; Here discreet and trusty Friars, Rule the Brotherhood as Priors; Some are known as casuists, Theologians, canonists; One among them, here and there, Rises to the prelate's chair. Thence again his parts and knowledge, Fix him in the sacred college, With the robe of Cardinal; Last—the topmost point of all— The majestic throne of Pope, Stands within the verge of hope: That supreme and awful state, Which the noble and the great With devout obeisance greet, Humbly falling at his feet. Messina, Feb. 9, 1821. TRANSLATION FROM FAUST. Act III. Scene VII. Mephistopheles. But I withdraw myself. I see You've visitors of quality. Martha. Come get your best bred answer ready, My dear, he takes you for a lady. Margaret. 'Tis the good gentleman's good nature,— I'm a poor harmless simple creature, I've neither jewels, silk, nor lace; I've nothing but my silly face. Martha. Ah! dress and jewels are not all, But there's a style, an air withal, An elegance— Meph. Well, if I may, I'm glad that I'm allowed to stay. Martha. And what's your errand, tell me, pray? Meph. My worthy dame, if I could chuse, I should have brought you better news: But 'tis a promise, after all, Your husband begg'd of me to call. To give his best respects, he said And to acquaint you—He was dead. Martha. What, dead! dear honest soul! And I— I shan't survive it. I shall die. Marg. Good worthy mother, don't distract Yourself. Meph. The melancholy fact Is as I mentioned. Marg. Well, I vow, For my part it would kill me now,— I never should look up again. Meph. Pain follows pleasure—pleasure pain. Martha. But how? when did it happen? Say! Meph. Your husband lies in Padua, In a fair churchyard open'd newly, Enclosed and consecrated duly, In the best spot that could be found, Accommodated under ground. Martha. You've brought me something, I suppose? Meph. Yes, when his life drew to a close He trusted me with a commission Of costly charge: his last petition, As a memorial of the dead, To have five hundred masses said. Dec. 1835. ÆSOP'S FABLE OF THE FROGS. FROM LA FONTAINE. The Frogs time out of mind Lived uncontroll'd. Their form of government was undefined, But reasons, strong and manifold, Which then were given, Induced them to demand a King from Heaven. Jove heard the prayer—and, to fulfil it, Threw them down a Log or Billet: The Prince arrived with such a dash, Coming down to take possession; Frogs are easy to abash, Their valour is diluted with discretion,— In a word their hearts forsook them: That instant they dissolved the Session, Choosing the shortest way that took them Down to the bottom of the Bog,— Not one remain'd to cry, “God save King Log.” There was an ancient flap-chapped Peer, Nobly born Of the best spawn; At first he kept aloof from fear, Waiting the close of all this storm, Till things should take some settled form— Like a great vassal, In his castle, With full-blown bags, Intrench'd with lofty bullrushes and flags. A wish to gain the sovereign's ear, Made him draw near; He saw him where he lay in state, With a solidity and weight, That bespoke him truly great. Then came a shoal in quest of posts and charges, Much like our ancient courtiers with their barges, They ventured barely within reach,— The Chancellor discharged a speech: They waited for his majesty's reply,— They waited a long, tedious, awkward space, Then stared each other in the face, And drew more nigh,— Till growing bolder, They leap'd upon the back and shoulder Of their Stadholder. The worthy monarch all that while Was never seen to frown or smile, He never looked, he never stirred,— He never spoke a single word, Bad or good. It seem'd as if he neither heard Nor understood. The Frogs, like Russian nobles in such cases, Reading each others' meaning in their faces, Proceeded to the monarch's deposition,— This act was followed by preferring A new Petition For a new Prince more active and more stirring. The prayer was heard; To make quick work, Jove sent them down the Stork, First cousin to the Secretary Bird. His forte was business and despatch: At the first snatch He swallowed the Polonius of the Pool; Then following Machiavelli's rule, He fell upon the poor Marsh-landers, Conscribing all that he could catch, Trampling them down into the mud, Confiscating their guts and blood, Like a French Prefect sent to Flanders. The wretched frogs in their despair Renewed their prayer; And Jove in answer thundered this decree,— “Since you could not agree, “To live content and free, “I sent you down a King of the best wood, “Suited to your pacific brood; “Your foolish pride “Set him aside, “This second was intended for a curse,— “Be satisfied—or I shall find a worse.” 1810. TRANSLATION FROM PROSPER AQUITANUS. “Hinc arbitrium per devia lapsum Claudiat, &amp;c.” v. 586. The bewildered will, Wanders in ways uncouth and stumbles still, Never at rest, but ever in the wrong, Yet eager, indefatigable, strong; Within the Labyrinthine circle bound, In every path of error pacing round, Vain hope, illusive confidence attend, And guide the victim to his destined end,— Frantic he rushes on forbidden ground, Falls in a snare and rises with a wound. Nay, more to the distracted fallen will, The grace that saves and heals appears to kill, Suspending life and motion if applied. No wonder—if a madman in his pride Chases the kind physician from his side, Loath to relinquish what his fever'd brain Suggests of rank and power, to sink again In weakness, want, and salutary pain. See the primæval artifice renew'd, The very fraud of Eden which imbued The streams of life with poison. Oh, beware, Heed not the subtle snake—avoid the snare, Let not the flattering whisper tempt you now, To feed on venom from the faded bough,— Faded and broken, blighted at the fall, Think not the evil diet will recall, And nourish the Divine similitude, The angelic form. So pestilent and crude, It feeds their angry tumour, throbbing rife In the proud flesh, and from the fruits of life Drives them with loathing horror—forth they flee, And with a rabid instinct shun the Tree. Pieta, Nov. 1821. TRANSLATIONS OF SOME OF THE PSALMS OF DAVID. PSALM I. Blessed is He—the man that hath not walk'd In the counsel of the reprobate, nor talk'd With Sinners in the broad and beaten way: Nor, with unsanctified and haughty sway, Throned in the magisterial chair, presum'd To censure and condemn what God hath doom'd. But his delight is in that blessed Law,— To find it holy, pure, and free from flaw; His task, his recreation, his delight, Both Even and Morn, and in the depths of Night. So shall he prosper,—flourishing and free, Like to the natural or the mystic tree, Fast by the living waters; bringing forth In his due season fruits of kindly worth, Alms and oblations: while his very leaf Shall whisper of repentance and belief Mov'd by the Spirit of heav'n, and vocal made, A living tongue,—it shall not fall nor fade. Not so the ungodly.—When the winds arise To scatter their inventions worldly wise, Wafted in wild opinion to and fro, With their atomic chaff,—away they go. Therefore the curious spirits, idly bold, Rash, sinful, insolent, shall stand controul'd, With their exploded postulates uncouth, In the firm Synod of eternal Truth. The Lord is over all,—to mark and know The spirit and heart and mind of all below, He 'stablishes and confirms the good,—and ever Confounds the unrighteous in their vain endeavour. Psalm II. EASTER DAY. Why do the nations rage and storm in vain With insurrection furious and profane; And Lo,—the Monarchs of the world are met! Their ranks are muster'd, and their council set; Princes and people—all with one accord United in revolt against their Lord; Against the Lord, and his anointed Son; The purpose and design is ever one; Whether tyrannic, or tumultuous,—still Enthroning earthly Wisdom, Power and Will: The last prerogative of human pride Claim'd and avow'd,—to cast the bonds aside Which fetter human action;—to be free From Him the Almighty Eternal Enemy! “Come—let us break the chain, and rend away “These links of mental slavery”—Thus they say.— He that abides in Heav'n,—surveys awhile Their hideous uproar with an awful smile; Till wrath divine,—long slumbering and supprest, Rouses at length,—and each rebellious breast Quell'd and appall'd,—attends the vast decree Vouch'd in a voice of angry majesty. “Yet shall He reign,—and He shall rule ye still “Anointed and enthron'd on Sion's hill.” He comes!—“I come the Teacher and the King, “The Lawgiver; Jehovah's word I bring; “He saith to me,—‘Mine only Son! this day ‘Begotten, avow'd and born; demand, and say; ‘Ask and obtain thy privilege of birth; ‘All tribes and tongues and every realm of earth! ‘Thou shalt control them with the Rule of Right; ‘As with an iron rod; to rive and smite ‘The reprobate; and like the potter's ware ‘Scatter asunder Empires here and there.’” Therefore be timely wise, O ye the Chief Of earthly powers!—Obedience and Belief May yet avail you; but the time is brief;— The warning is gone forth;—the event is near; Be wise and learned;—Serve the Lord in fear! Princes and Kings of earth salute the Son With reverence, ere the tempest is begun; The storm of fiery wrath; whose angry blaze May snatch you wandering in forbidden ways If it be rous'd and kindled; bless'd are all That with a trembling hope await the call. Psalm XXI. ASCENSION. He shall rejoice, O Lord, our rightful King, Exulting in thy succour, conquering The eternal enemy with Thy strength and aid. —Sin, Death and Sorrow and Pain are captive made— —His heart's desire thou grantest him—the scope Of every supplication, prayer, and hope! With bounty, and love, and favor overflowing, With blessing thou preventest him; bestowing On his anointed head, the regal ring Incorruptible, as Conqueror, Priest and King! The gold thereof is perfect; purified Tormented in the furnace, prov'd and tried. Life was the boon he sought; yet not to live Alone; but life eternal didst thou give: Great is his glory and praise, atchieved at length In Thy salvation, with thy power and strength. Thy countenance shall gladden him; and display A second self; with delegated sway Co-ordinate; a fountain, and a store, Of mercy, and Hope, and Grace for evermore, For all the nations! For his faith was tried; For that his trust in Thee was testified; Thy mercy shall maintain him on the throne, Time without end, unshaken and alone! King! Conqueror!—in thy wrath thou shalt arise And thy right hand shall reach thine enemies With ready vengeance—as the flames and heat, That round the vaulted furnace rave and beat, Enkindling and devouring all within; Thy judgments shall consume the sons of sin, The fuel of wrath, outrageous, fiery, rife, With inextinguishable fury and strife Kindled to self destruction; branch and root Thou shalt eradicate them!—seed and fruit Exterminated!—neither name nor place Left upon earth—nor memory, nor trace!— For why? the malice of their hearts was bent Against Thy kingdom and name;—The vain intent Is baffled, and recoils;—Thy vengeful bow, Arm'd and up-rais'd, is visible below!— Stunn'd and amaz'd, the thunder of the string, Strikes on their ear, Thy shafts are on the wing! O Lord, our succour in that fearful hour Exalt Thyself in Thine own strength and Power; So shall we praise Thy blessed name, and sing Our Conqueror and Deliverer, Lord and King. Psalm XXII. GOOD FRIDAY. My God, my God, look on me! why dost thou— In agony and distress—forsake me now, Forlorn of help from thee?—my daily cry Goes up before thy throne, O Lord, most high! Incessant,—instant,—from the dawn of light, And in the restless watches of the night: But Thou remainest, stedfast, holy, pure, Righteous, unchanged, and Thy decrees endure Eternally predestin'd truly and well, O Thou, the glory and praise of Israel! Our Fathers hop'd in Thee; they cried and prayed For help; and Thou didst grant them present aid; They trusted and were holpen;—as for me A worm and not a man—the last degree Of deep debasement, ignominy, and scorn, Oppresses me overwhelm'd and overborne— An outcast of the people, a mark, a stock For vulgar tongues and lips to taunt and mock; Saying, “He trusted in his God to save him, “Let God then interpose, if God will have him”— Yes—Thou art He—that from my mother's womb Deliveredst me to light,—my trust,—on whom Whilst laid at rest upon the nursing breast, My thoughts and hopes were daily and hourly dwelling: Father and Lord in mercy and might excelling, Whose glory and praise my lips were ever telling, Leave me not here abandon'd and alone; For trouble is hard at hand, and help is none! The bestial herd of Basan close me round, In boisterous outrage, with a savage sound Of rage and outcry, like the lion's howl, And eyes and gestures eager, fierce and foul— And there I stand amongst them!—silent, slow, Weak as the very water; faint and low; My bones are out of joint; my heart within Melts as the wax; my lips and tongue begin To shrivel and wither with the parching breath— And thou shalt bring me to the dust of death!— The bloody dogs, the unclean are in the crowd! With the hypocritic Elders stern and proud— My feet and hands are pierc'd, and every bone Naked and bare, and counted one by one! In empty wonderment they gather round, Gazing upon me, watching every wound!— My garments are shar'd out—my vest unrent Stak'd as a prize, with ribald merriment!— But be not Thou far from me, O God my strength! Father and Lord! incline thine ear at length— Haste Thee to help me; save my soul from scath Of fiendish rage; and thine appointed wrath, The sword of Eden brandish'd early and long!— So shall I praise Thee with a joyful song Of victory and redemption; and proclaim Thy justice and Thy mercies and Thy name Amongst the brethren—Ye that fear the Lord! Sons of the chosen seed! with one accord Magnify and praise his name, with love and awe! Sons of the covenant and of the law! Children of Jacob and of Israel! For ye can witness well,—that he the Lord Hath not abhorr'd—nor shunn'd the deep infliction, That dreadful interdiction undergoing, His tears in anguish flowing, and his cry Were heard and seen on high; the Almighty face Was turn'd to pity and grace,—and pardon given, And ratified in heaven!—A louder voice Shall summon to rejoice, a congregation From many a tribe and nation; wider far; From where the appointed star Leads forth the mystic eastern Sages hoar; E'en to the silent, shady, western shore; The guests are marshall'd, and the banquet spread, With heavenly wine and bread—The bread of life! Without restraint or strife, or fear, or sadness, In singleness of heart, with love and gladness; A company which death shall not dissever— They share the food which leads to life for ever. Lastly, the extremest tribes and every race Of the World's utmost space, Spelling aright,—the words of truth and light Through dark confus'd tradition long abus'd, Shall turn anew;—to recollect the true Saviour—and Sacrifice,—and Child of Heaven, —The great primæval Hope and Promise given! The Lord is ruler; every Realm of earth His heritage of birth, is claim'd and held Subdued and quell'd,—beneath his awful sway; Princes and kings obey; the noble and great Sages and Chiefs of State, with humble cheer Attend the table in fear; or serve and wait: Bashful and late, the sad rejected Seed, From guilt and error freed, return at length; To be renew'd in strength, a mighty nation; Again accounted as a generation, Enroll'd and register'd before the Lord, Upon the great record;—to testify Of the Most High; the deeds which he hath done; Pardon and grace with mighty struggles won, And glory and rule ordain'd; for him the anointed Amidst a race pre-destin'd and appointed. Psalm XLV. CHRISTMAS DAY. My thoughts burst forth, even as a boiling spring; As a full flowing course of ready writing; From the deep source inditing, The glory and praise of our anointed King: Thy form, O King! is fairer, and thy face, Than the degraded, earthly, fallen Race; Thy lips are full of Wisdom, Truth, and Grace; For He, the Lord hath blessed thee for ever. Gird and prepare Thee, for the great endeavour; Gird and prepare, the sword upon thy thigh, Oh, Thou Most High! With glory and majesty Ride prosperously forth; with pity and ruth, Justice and Mercy, Righteousness and Truth, The strength of thy right hand shall counsel thee; Framing the final Covenant and Law, The Mystic Bow; the work of wonder and awe, Which hands almighty alone, can bend and draw. From the tremendous string, What fearful echoes ring, Touches and tones of the celestial weapon: To those that gather round, Thy faithful followers found, With no discordant sound they rise and deepen: While through the world are seen The winged volleys keen, Shattering its frail defences, piercing, rending, Incessant on the mingled host descending, A living shower of flame, each fiery dart Sped with unerring aim, to search the reins and heart. Thy throne, O God! for ever and for ever, Is fixt—nor years, nor earthly time, shall sever The sceptre from thy grasp—Our King our God! Just is thy sceptre, righteous is thy rod! For in thy secret heart, and inmost sense, Hatred of sin, deep hatred, and intense Was prov'd, in shame, and agony, and distress, Triumphant in the zeal of righteousness. Therefore even he thy God, with regal unction Of grace and gladness, to thy rightful function Hath raised thee, with supreme investiture— Anointed, consecrated, holy, pure, Inaugurate in perfect majesty: A visible earthly present Deity! From the rich unguent shed Upon thy sacred head, A wide perfume is spread—thy robes of state Waft odours, that proclaim From whence the tribute came; In just obedience from the wise and great, Proud halls, and ivory domes of Eastern kings, Have sent their precious things, To gladden thee with homage and adore; Myrrh, nard, and cassia from the spicy shore; Such gifts as sooth'd thine infant heart before. Daughters of Kings, of comely garb and hue, Stand in attendance due—Thy Bride and Queen Pre-eminent is seen, in stately vesture, In stature, form, and mien, in princely gesture, And comeliness of look surpassing all; Within the regal hall preferr'd to stand, At thy right hand, distinct in rich array, Rich with the gold of Ophir, purified, Refin'd, and fully tried with hard assay. Hear and attend, O Daughter! Bride! and Queen! Mark and attend!—forget what thou hast been; Thy name, thy nation, and thy father's house, Thy customary vows, and wonted duty; So shall the king have pleasure in thy beauty: Him shalt thou worship, honour'd and ador'd With other rites, thy Saviour and thy Lord! Yet She too with her offering shall be seen, The tributary Queen, Daughter of Tyre; That with her ample hire, and worldly dower; Sagacious of the coming hour, had wrought; And pearls of price with thrifty purchase bought; And plac'd with wary trust, her wealthy store, Where neither moth nor rust corrupt for evermore. Behold in royal pride The glorious happy bride, In woven gold magnificently drest; Her gorgeous outer robe and inner vest With mystic forms imprest; Forms which the painful needle long had wrought With subtle labour to perfection brought. Yet see with livelier air Her young companions fair, Harmless and joyous, innocent of care, Fearless of fraud or guile, guiltless of malice, With sportive easy cheer, and airy sallies, They pass the court, and enter at the Palace; A fair approval meeting; Applauded and receiv'd with kindly greeting. Think, then, no more of thine ancestral glory, The Sages and the Saints of ancient story, Prophets and Kings—look to the future race, Ordained to nobler things—A wider space Of Empire and command, in other times, Stretching in ample climes unknown before. For me, thy Name and praise for evermore Shall be my theme—a song for future days, When thy supreme and undivided claim Of Empire every realm of earth shall bless And magnify and confess Thy mighty name. Psalm LXVIII. WHIT-SUNDAY. Let God arise! And let his enemies Be scattered and disperst! The unrighteous, reprobate, profane, accurst! Let them that hate him flee before His face; As when the winds of Heaven, with easy chace Pursue the smoky blot that taints the sky (In vain aspiring high Rising and reeking from this earthly spot) The feeble fumes that waver and dissever, Vanish at once away dissolv'd for ever; Or as the mass of wax within the fire Sinks shapeless and dissolv'd, thy fervent ire, Shall melt their hearts with horror and dismay: So shall they perish, shrink and waste away; The righteous shall behold it, and rejoice Before the Lord, with cheerful heart and voice: Praise ye the Lord in his ineffable name Jah; the maintainer of this earthly frame; Ruling and riding on the wheeling sphere Like a strong horseman; curbing its career, Bound through the barren empty tracts of space; Thy providence and power shall also trace A path before Thee, thro' the tracts of time: And marshal forth the eventful march sublime, Pacing the void of blank futurity— God shall accomplish it. The Father He Of all the destitute; to save and bless The widows, the forlorn, the fatherless, The solitary souls inur'd to chains Planting them forth among the pleasant plains To dwell in happy families and tribes; But other destiny and abode prescribes For the rebellious, barren, hard and bare, With hunger and cold, with scanty and evil fare. Lord, when thou wentest forth, their mighty and dread Sovereign and Chief; their covenanted Head; Rescuing the sons of Jacob from distress; When thou didst march amidst the wilderness, Veiling thy glories in an earthly tent; The solid earth did quake; the firmament Stood shrouded and appall'd; seeming to weep, Blotting the soil with heavy drops and deep —Drops of atoning sorrow from above— And Sinai's mighty Rock was seen to move, Bowing his antient hoary form sublime, Mysterious, rooted in the abyss of time. But on Thine heritage, Thou didst diffuse A gracious shower of heavenly and holy dews; Cheering the famish'd hearts forlorn and weary; Appointing in the desert parch'd and dreary, A place of rest, a plenteous habitation For Thine own flock, Thy chosen congregation— God gave the word—a mighty multitude Moved forth at once, with faith and hope endued; Invested in the panoply divine; Train'd and arrayed in saintly discipline; —A noble army of Martyrs—forth they went, That (with the sound and sight, and summons sent) Kings and embattled hosts in panic haste Fled headlong—wide apart, disperst and chas'd; Enriching humble households with the spoil Of Heathen pride; without fatigue or toil, Sharing at home the gain of godliness. Long have ye lain in torture and distress, The furnace of affliction; soon to rise, Lustrous as gold or silver, with the dies That wander o'er the changeful Dove and deck Her silver wings, and gold-enamel'd neck: Bright, pure, and ever welcome, such as she Heralds of peace and safety shall ye be— In the full triumph, Salmon's western height Shines forth, enrob'd in pure and snowy white The token of victory—proud Basan stands Far eastward, overlooking heathen lands With lofty ranges of superb ascent, Lordly, majestical, magnificent, Sources of health, and living springs of life, Each in his region—but forbear the strife Ye mighty and haughty Mountains! be not moved Though Sion's hill be chosen and approv'd Even as the saintly Sinai was before, More honoured, better loved, and cherish'd more— Even as at Sinai, there the Lord shall be The Lord of Hosts, with might and majesty, With fiery ministers, and cars of flame Myriads of myriads—with a loud acclaim In Heaven and Earth—The Lord is risen on high! Destroying Death, leading captivity Captive and bound; large ransom doth he give Even for his enemies to be sav'd and live To praise and honour Him—Here His throne and place Are stablish'd.—Hence He deals His gifts of grace In kingly largess—Hence He shall subdue The rugged-headed, rude, rebellious crew Perverse and hard, marring their shaggy crown With His harsh sceptre, bruis'd and beaten down— “Yet once again” the Lord hath said—“once more “As from the field of Basan heretofore “Will I lead forth my people ransom-free “Rescued from labor and captivity “From the overwhelming multitudinous sea “To the rich purchase of fair victory “Their promis'd land.” Thy feet shall print the ground With bloody traces—thy familiar hound Shall tinge his tongue with carnage.—Pomp and state, Praises and Hymns upon Thy triumph wait, Conqueror and Lord, and leader of the tribes! As holy pure magnific use prescribes. First in the march the solemn singers go Mounting in even rank, and cadence slow; The thronging Minstrels crowd the rear below; And in the midst, a goodly troop and fair, With the light timbrel tost and wav'd in air, Are seen ascending on the sacred hill, With happy virgin voices pure and shrill. Praise ye the Lord in holy congregations, Praise ye the Lord aloud among the nations, Your kindred Chief, the stream from Jacob's well; The Scion of the root of Israel— There might the little Benjamin preside Their humble early Ruler—or the Pride Of princely Judah with his Peers of State, Or from remoter Regions, grave and great, Counsellors, Sages, Rulers, many a one, Wise Nepthali, the wealthy Zabulon: But he the Lord hath sent thee forth in strength, Strengthen, O Lord, Thy work; assert at length Thine own dominion; what Thy power hath wrought Fix and confirm it to fulfilment brought: That other Kings and Chiefs may bend the knee, Prone and adoring; suppliant to thee With offer'd tribute for Thy temple's sake: When in Thy wrath Thou shalt rebuke and break The multitude of Spearmen, and the Beast, Hideous and huge in loathly bulk increast, That haunts the sultry Memphian's River's edge, Weltering and battening in the bristled sedge; (The people of Priests, the formal haughty line, That with the clinking silver glance and shine The dull idolaters of Calves and Kine—) Then shall the Lords and Chiefs of Egypt stand And stretch before Thee the submissive hand In supplication and surrender due: And Ethiopia's Queen shall turn anew, To worship in thy precincts; to behold Thy rich array, the pomp of power and gold; And marvels of Thy wisdom widely told— Sing to the Lord, ye realms of Earth, O Sing The praises of your King, in Heaven abiding, Upon the wheeling spheres in glory riding Before all ages, years, or earthly time, Eternal and sublime; He sendeth forth An image of his worth; the Eternal word Our delegated Lord, a mighty voice, Bidding his Saints rejoice; proclaim and tell That here in Israel, the Lord hath placed His temple and throne, and with His presence graced This land alone—His power and majesty Stretches above the sky, but Israel! Within thy sacred cell, to daunt thy foes; What awe does it disclose, what terrors carry, Enshrin'd and shrouded in thy Sanctuary! —Chaunt forth in loud accord The glad triumphant word Praised be the Lord for ever. Praise the Lord. PSALM XC. Before the solid mountains were upraised, Heaved from the teeming earth to light and air, Or that firm surface of the land appeared, Or habitable earth, cheerful and fair, Thou Lord abidest ever first and last, The Eternal Future and the Eternal Past, Sovereign and Judge; in thy predestined plan, Extinguishing the feeble race of man; Again the word is uttered—Turn again, Inhabitants of earth; children of men! Yes! for a thousand years are, in Thy sight, As a brief interval passing away, Like the neglected hours of yesterday, Or unregarded watches of the night. Thy floods have overborne them; and they seem, Their whole existence, memory, name, and place, All vanished like a vision in a dream— Sunk and extinct, an unremember'd race. As the fresh grass, that in the summer air Flourishes rank and free, lusty and fair, It waxes wanton in its growth of pride; But the destroyer comes at even-tide, With his fell weapon; there it lies at length, Stripped of its beauty and strength, wasted and dried. JUDGES. Chap. V. v. 9—13. I love the noble and the great, The learned and the wise, Ready to rouse and animate, Ready to share the common fate, The common enterprise: Join me then with frank accord, Join to praise and bless the Lord. Ye that on pacers snowy white, Are wont to ride, a comely sight— Or on the judgment-seat Sit with a grave and steady cheer, Or move majestic and severe, Thoughtful and awful in the street, Let your daily duties cease— Noisy debates and petty pleas, For drawing water from a well, Proclaim aloud in Israel, Jehovah's judgments and decrees, The statutes of Jehovah's reign, His bounty to the villages, The vassals of his own domain; Proclaim them where this people wait As suitors at the city gate. Rouse, rouse thee, Deborah, raise, Loud and high, the song of praise; Barak, in thy manly worth, Son of Abinoam, stand forth, A captive and a refugee, Advanced to power and victory, Henceforth appointed to command Among the nobles of the land: For me, Jehovah will afford Counsel and succour: He, the Lord Will prosper and direct by me The mighty chiefs of victory. ECCLESIASTES. Chap. VII. v. 6. The mirth of fools, somewhere the preacher says, Is like the cracking thorns when in a blaze; So unsubstantial are their liveliest joys, Made up of thoughtless levity and noise: Tho' at the first the mantling flame looks bright, 'Tis but a momentary glare of light, With nothing solid to sustain the fire, It quickly sinks, and all their joys expire. 1801.
