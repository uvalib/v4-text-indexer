      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. PSYCHE IN XXIV. CANTO's. CANTO I. The Preparative. The ARGUMENT. Enrag'd at Heav'n and Psyche, Satan laies His projects to beguile the tender Maid, Whilst Phylax proper counter-works doth raise, And mustereth Joseph's Legend to her aid; That fortify'd by this chast Pattern, She To Lust's assaults impregnable might be. I Eternal LOVE, of sweetest Poetry The sweeter King, from thine high Mercies' Throne Deign to behold my prostrate Vow, and Me: No Muse, no Gods, but greater Thee alone I invocate; for both his heads full low Parnassus to thy Paradise doth bow. 2 Thy Paradise, thro' whose fair Hills of Joy Those Springs of everlasting Vigor range, Which make Souls drunk with Heav'n, which cleanse away All Earth from Dust, and Flesh to Spirit change. Wise loyal Springs, whose current to no Sea Its panting voyage ever steers, but Thee. 3 Sage Moses first their wondrous might descry'd, When, by some drops from hence imbraved, he His triumph sung o'er th'Erythræan Tide. But Royal David, and his Son, by free Carrowsing in these nobly-sacred Streams With Poets' chaplets crown'd their Diadems. 4 Defiance other Helicons! O may These precious Founts my Vow and Heart refine! My task, dear Love, art Thou: if ever Bay Court my poor Muse, I'll hang it on thy shrine. My Soul untun'd, unstrung, doth wait on Thee To teach her how to sing thy MYSTERY. 5 A MYSTERY envelop'd in a cloud Of charming horror, barricado'd round With dainty Riddles, guarded by a crowd Of quiet Contradictions; so profound A Plain, that Psyche's long-acquainted eye Stagger'd about its misty Clarity. 6 A MYSTERY, which other Shades beset; Substantial Shades, made up of solid Hate; Born in the Deep, which knows no bottom, yet Vent'ring to block up Heaven's sublimest gate: Whilst Belzebub, in blackness damn'd to dwell, Plots to have all things else as dark as Hell. 7 For He, th'immortal Prince of equal spight, Abhors all Love in every name and kind; But chiefly that which burns with flames as bright As his are swarthy, and as endless find Their living fuel: These enrage him so, That all Hell's Furies must to council go. 8 For (as the wounded Lyon frights his Den By roaring out his grief;) his shatter'd heart Vomits a hideous groan, which thundring in His hollow realm, bellow'd to every part The frightful summons: all the Peers below Their King's voice by its sovereign stink did know. 9 Nor dar'd they stay their tails vast volumes to Abridge into a knot's Epitome; Or trim their hoofs foul cleft with iron shoe, Or their snarl'd snakes' confusion unty: Only their paws they fill with Rage, and bring That desperate subsidy to their mad King. 10 Hell's Court is built deep in a gloomy Vale, High wall'd with strong Damnation, moated round With flaming Brimstone: full against the Hall Roars a burnt bridge of brass: the yards abound With all invenom'd Herbs and Trees, more rank And fruitless than on Asphaltite's bank. 11 The Gate, where fire and smoke the Porters be, Stands always ope with gaping greedy jaws. Hither flock'd all the States of misery; As younger snakes, when their old serpent draws Them by a summoning hiss, hast down her throat Of patent poison their aw'd selves to shoot. 12 The Hall was roof'd with everlasting Pride, Deep pavèd with Despair, checker'd with Spight, And hangèd round with Torments far and wide: The front display'd a goodly-dreadful sight, Great Satan's Arms stamp'd on an iron shield, A Crownèd Dragon Gules in sable field. 13 There on's immortal throne of Death they see Their mounted Lord; whose left hand proudly held His Globe, (for all the world he claims to be His proper realm,) whose bloody right did weild His Mace, on which ten thousand serpents knit, With restless madness gnaw'd themselves, and it. 14 His insolent feet all other footstools scorn'd But what compleatest Scorn to them suggested; This was a Cross; yet not erect, but turn'd Peevishly down. The robe which him invested, In proud embroidery shew'd that envious Feat By which of Paradise he Man did cheat. 15 His Diadem was neither brass nor rust, But monstrous Metal of them both begot; Which millions of vilest Stones imbost, Yet precious unto him, since he by that Artillery his fatal batteries had On heav'n-belovèd Martyrs' bodies made. 16 His awful Horns above his crown did rise, And force his fiends to shrink in theirs: his face Was triply-plated Impudence: his Eyes Were Hell reflected in a double glass, Two Comets staring in their bloody stream, Two Beacons boyling in their pitch and flame. 17 His Mouth in breadth vy'd with his palace gate, And conquer'd it in foot: his tawny Teeth Were raggèd grown by endless gnashing at The dismal Riddle of his living Death: His grizly Beard a sing'd confession made What fiery breath through his black lips did trade. 18 Which as he op'd, the Center, on whose back His Chair of ever-fretting Pain was set, Frighted beside it self began to quake: Throughout all Hell the barking Hydra's shut Their awèd mouths: the silent Peers in fear Hung down their tails, and on their Lord did stare. 19 Three times he shak'd his horns; three times his Mace He brandish'd towards heav'n; three times he spew'd Fell sulphur upward: which when on his face It sousèd back, foul Blasphemy ensu'd, So big, so loud, that his huge Mouth was split To make full passage to his Rage, and it. 20 I yield not yet; Defiance Heav'n, said He, And though I cannot reach thee with my fire, Yet my unconquer'd Brain shall able be To grapple with thee; nor canst thou be higher Than my brave Spight: Know, though below I dwell, Heav'n has no stouter Hearts than strut in Hell. 21 For all thy vaunting Promise to the seed Of dust-begotten Man, my head is here Unbroken still: When thy proud foot did tread Me down from my own Spheres, my forehead there Both met and scorn'd the blow: And thou at first (Whate'r thou talk'st to Man,) didst do thy worst. 22 Courage my Lords; ye are the same, who once Ventur'd on that renown'd Design with me Against the Tyrant call'd Heav'n's righteous Prince. What though Chance stole from us that Victory? 'Twas the first field we fought; and He being in His own Dominion, might more easily win. 23 How oft have We met Him mid-way since then, And in th'indifferent world not vainly fought! Forc'd We him not to yield all mortal Men At once, but simple Eight? though He'd be thought Then to have shown his pow'r, when he was fain Basely to drown what he could not maintain. 24 Poor shift! yet make the best on't, still the odds Is ours; and that our yelling Captives feel: Ours is a fiery Deluge, but their God's A watery flood: His scarce had strength to swell For some vain months; ours scorns the bounds of age, And foams and boils with everlasting rage. 25 And let it boil, whilst to the endless shame Of our high-bragging Foe, those Pris'ners there With helpless roars our Victory proclaim: What nobler Trophies could we wish to rear! Are they not Men of the same Flesh and Blood With that frail Christ, who needs would seem a God? 26 A pretty God, whom I, sole I, of late Caus'd to be fairly hang'd. 'Tis true he came By stealth, and help'd by sly Night, forc'd Hell's gate: But snatch'd he any Captive hence, that Fame Might speak him valiant? No, he knew too well That I was King, and you the Peers of Hell. 27 Yet to patch up his tatter'd credit, He Sneak'd through that Gulf, to barbarous Abraham's den, Who for his ready inhumanity Was dubb'd the Father of all faithful Men. Less, less my Pilate, was thy Crime; yet Thou (O righteous Heav'n!) now yellest here below. 28 His willing prizes thence he won; (but how Forlorn a Rout, let Lazarus witness be, Who the late pity of vile dogs, was now A special Saint:) and this vain victory Homeward he bore, with banner proudly spread, As if with his own blood t'had not been red. 29 Me thinks I could permit him to possess That pilfer'd honor, did he now forbear My Subjects from their Loyalty to press, And lure poor cheated Men his yoke to wear. But by my Wrath I swear, I'll make him know That I of Earth and Air am Sovereign too. 30 Well beat, O my immortal Indignation! Thou nobly swell'st my belking Soul; and I Success's Omen feel. Brave Desperation Doth sneaking fear's objections defy: Shall we be tamely damn'd, and new ones bear, Because our old Wrongs unrevengèd are? 31 Was't not enough, against the righteous Law Of Primogeniture, to throw us down From that bright Home, which all the World do's know Was by most clear Inheritance our own: But, to our shame, Man, that vile Worm must dwell In our fair Orbs, and Heaven with vermin fill? 32 What tricks, charms, promises, and mystic Arts, What blandishments of fainèd fawning things, He musters up to woo these silly hearts! Doubtless God-like into the field he brings This jugling strength of his Artillery: Yet, who, forsooth, the Tempters are, but we? 33 Psyche, a simple thing I wot, and one Whom I as deeply scorn, as Him I spight, He seeks to make his prize; Psyche alone Takes up his amorous Thoughts both day and night. Were't not our wrong, I could contented be Heaven's goodly Prince had such a Spouse as she. 34 But she is ours; I have design'd a place Due to her vileness in yon brimstone Lake, Which shall revenge whatever in her face Do's now her lusty God a Wooer make. He promis'd her, that with the Angels she Should live; and so she shall; but those are We. 35 We, noble We, who true unto our pure Original, disdainèd to betray Our native excellence; and by demure Baseness, in stead of Ruling, to Obey. What proof of virtuous bravery could be greater, Than thus to scorn ev'n God himself to flatter? 36 But since this God now thinks it fit to fly From open Force, to his Reserve of Art; Surely 'twill no dishonour be, if I Deign to outplay him in his own sly part. That all th'amazèd World may understand Our gallant Brain's as potent as our Hand. 37 Lust, thou shalt give the Onset: quickly dress Thy self with every beauteous charm, which my Aerial Kingdom yields, and subtly press Our counterplot: remember but how thy Sweet guiles did once a mighty King subvert, However fam'd to be After God's heart. 38 Then Philauty and Pride shall stretch her Soul With swelling poison, making her disdain Heav'ns narrow gate; whilst Wealth it self doth roll Into her bosom in a golden Rain; That she may grow too rich to match with one, Of a poor Carpenter the poorer Son. 39 Next shall my Secretary Heresy Right sagely teach her to become too wise To take up points on trust, and foolèd be By saucy Faith plainly against her eyes. Then Persecution's flame shall earnest give Of that full fire which she shall here receive. 40 If still she tough and stubborn prove, do thou, My dear Despair, about her sullen heart Millions of black confusions toss, and through Her tortur'd thoughts all Hell aforehand dart. 'Tis my Prerogative, that I can dare To build assurèd Hope ev'n on Despair. 41 Nor shall this Service due requital want: That trusty lucky Fiend who do's the feat, Shall wear the Prize he wins, and by my Grant Of Charter Royal be confirm'd the great Master of Psyche's torments; He, and none But he, shall order her Damnation. 42 Nay for his greater honor, every night With seven full lashes he shall plow the heart Of Judas and of Cain; nor from my sight Henceforth on any work shall he depart, But here at my right hand Attendant be For ever, and Blaspheme the next to me. 43 Go then in God's name, but that God am I, And here my blessing on you all I deal. Catch but this Wench; and by that Victory We'll torture Christ more deeply than this Hell Doth you or Me, and so revenge the pain To which the Tyrant all brave Us doth chain. 44 This said; he from his scaly bosom draws Five Dragons' hides tann'd in the Stygian Pool, And scratch'd with his own Adamantine Claws. Then, lo, he cries, here in a several scroll Each Warrant ready sign'd. Fly, fly; delay Doth oft the strongliest-founded Plots betray. 45 His Senate strait with an obsequious roar Applaud their Prince: and those designèd Fiends Their Snaky-heads thrice bowing to the floor, Take their damn'd leave. Forthwith a Tempest rends Hell's wide mouth wider ope, that thro' the gate They may their march begin in horrid state. 46 Old Tellus wonder'd what wild Treason 'twas Which tore her deepest Bowels; for as from The monstrous Cannon's thundering mouth of Brass A sudden cloud of Rage and Death doth foam, So from beneath these hasty Furies broke: Such was the flashing fire, and such the smoke. 47 But fouler was the stink: all honest Flowers Frighted from their own sweets fell sick and dy'd; Stout Trees which had defy'd all Tempests powers, From this dire Breath sneak'd their faint heads aside. Only some venemous Weeds, whose roots from Hell Suck in their deadly living, lik'd the smell. 48 Lust falls to work the first: a Spirit as foul As he's ambitious beautiful to seem; Uncleanness keeps her Court in's muddy Soul; Poison's own breath from's rank mouth's grot doth steem; Black is the fire which burneth in his eye; Diseases thick in every member lie. 49 But being cunning in the cheating trade Of Circe and Medea [who had been His Prentices,] he soon contrivèd had What comely lie his ugly truth should screen; What goodly Body's spruce hypocrisy Should to his filthy mind the Pander be. 50 The purest Air which Virgin sweetness breaths On Libanus his Cedar-crownèd head, With Magic nimbleness he grasps, and wreaths, And shrinks, and kneads, and moulds, till worried From her soft self she is content to wear The shape of any Fraud he thrusts on her. 51 And thus the Nymph, tho' weak and loose before, And at the mercy of each busy blast, Becomes a stiff stout Man: whose face to store With Beautie's brightest charms, strait to the East The Spirit flies, and in Aurora's cheeks The best of Oriental sweetness seeks. 52 But since his breath still reek'd with stinks, and spoke The Gulf which spew'd him forth; he slop'd his flight To blest Arabia's Meads, from whence he took Each Flower's best Flower, each Spice's sweetest might: That from th'aromatizèd double bed Of his soft lips, he vocal Balm might shed. 53 Then raking thousand Virgins Tombs, he there Plunder'd the richest of their Amber tresses; With which, new curl'd and powdered, his bare And parchèd Scalp he amorously dresses: Then with perfumèd Combs instructs them how To smile, wave, play, and wantonly to flow. 54 This done; the Silk-worm's wealth, the Ermin's skin, The tissues in whose pride young Princes shine, Into one gorgeous suit he crowds; and in Each seam doth Gold and Pearls and Gems intwine: For thro' Earth's closets when his way he tore, He wisely pilfer'd all her gaudiest store. 55 But for the fashion he was fain to run To Court, and learn how Gallants there were drest; Men of more various transformations, than In Proteus wit or fiction e'er exprest: Chamelion's Apes, who rather than forbear To change their hue, will choose to live on Air. 56 An Amoroso here he chanc'd to spy Devoutly idolizing Her, whom he Only contriv'd to undermine; and by That Squire's quaint mode, he did his own decree. Bravely dissembled thus from head to feet, He plots where he may Psyche safeliest meet. 57 That morning she was feasting it at home Close in the sweets of His dear company, Who from her Lord, the King of Souls, was come His restless but delicious Suit to ply, And with exact attendance see the Maid Might to no sudden danger be betray'd. 58 A Mine of beauties in the Symmetry Of his all-ravishing aspect sweetly smil'd; Heaven clearly lookèd out at either eye; His roseal cheeks ten thousand Graces swell'd; As many little Loves their Nests had made In the curl'd Amber of his dainty head. 59 He from the Rain-bow, as he came that way, Borrow'd a Lace of those fair-woven beams Which clear Heaven's blubber'd face, and gild dull day; And this he sew'd on all his Mantle's seams, A Mantle spun of milky down, which had On Birds of his own Paradise been bred. 60 Upon his lovely shoulders dwelt a pair Of correspondent wings: no driven Snow On Scythian Hills durst vouch its plumes for fair If questionèd by these, which fear no thaw: Less white, less soft are they, and will at last With melting tears confess themselves surpast. 61 Well did his body's nimble vessel suit With those its gallant Oars; so pliant were His goodly timber'd Limbs, and yet so stout, That Wax and Steel seem'd kindly marry'd there. Hence, tho' he martial were, he lov'd to prove Himself the Warrior of none but Love. 62 High is his great Extraction, full as high As is the loftiest and the purest Sphere: There reigns his Father, Prince of Majesty, There millions of his Brethren shining are, And all as Princes too; that Land alone Contains innumerable Realms in one. 63 Yet did this Royalty not puff his heart Too high to his grand Sovereign's Will to bow; Or count it Earthly work from Heaven to part And wait on Jesus's business here below. O brave Obedience, whose wondrous art Can depth to height, and Earth to Heav'n convert! 64 At Psyche's birth his guardian Wing he spread With ready watchful tenderness, that she Might gently rest in that delicious bed, To which all other Feathers thorny be: Great was the Mother's care and love; but yet The Infant was to Phylax more in debt. 65 That was his Name; and sure he made it good: No Tutor ever spent more learnèd care, The stoutest Champion never bravelier stood Affronting Peril, and affrighting Fear; Than He in Psyche's quarrel, being able To prove himself as strong as she was feeble. 66 For Danger never drew its Forces near His precious Charge, but He was nearer still: All plots that Envy's cunning aim'd at Her, He counterplotted with profounder skill. While she was weak and knew not how to go, About flew He, and joy'd her work to do. 67 As she grew greater, so his care would grow; And he must wean her too, and stretch his Art To damp her relish of vain things below, Which likelier were to cheat and choke the Heart, Than make it live its proper life; for she Was born to live unto Eternity. 68 When she had learn'd to build a word aright, He taught her Heaven's high Language, and the Song Which lately in the Quire of Sovereign light Had been the task and joy of his own Tongue; Desiring Virtue might be her first growth, And Hallelujah broach her holy mouth. 69 To season then and preposses her tender Unwritten Memory; with Rarities Cull'd from God's Book he first allur'd her wonder, And then her pretty study did entice: Thus she well skill'd in holy Scripture grew, Before she knew what Book it was she knew. 70 Her prattle thus was Piety, and she By her own sport engagèd was in Bliss: Long, long before her Heart could movèd be Her Tongue could fly thro' Love's dear Mysteries; She having innocently learn'd the way Thro' both the serious Testaments to play. 71 But when her Soul could go, and well discern The way it went; he spread before her eye Ten goodly Paths; and these you needs must learn, Says he, to trace, as leading to the high Gate of pure Rest; for God's own finger did Draw for thy feet these Tracts on Sinai's head. 72 As for that broad and glaring way wherein Wild Sinners find full space to wantonize; It leads but to the guerdon of their sin, And in the closest Prison ends: but this Which with strict straitness seems besieg'd, will thee Convey to everlasting Liberty. 73 That straitness ne'r was meant to pend or press, But sure and upright make thy Passage: by The Nurse's wary hands the Child is thus Close guarded when he his young feet doth try. This is the heavenly temper of thy Way, To yield full room to go, but not to stray. 74 Room, room enough: the King's High-way is less Kingly than this: the greatest Heroes who Have climb'd above the World, wish'd not to press Beyond these bounds. Be but content to go Where Saints, and where thy Lord before hath gone, That thou mayst overtake him at his Throne. 75 Thus did He gently grave upon her Heart The Characters of Heaven; thus every day He reads some Lecture, lest the Tempter's Art Upon her young and plyant Soul should prey. But they this morning being private, she A story begg'd; and thus replyèd He: 76 Know then, my Dear, there liv'd a Youth of old Almost as young, and no less fair than Thou: On his rich Head smil'd a soft grove of Gold; Two small half Heavens were bent in either brow. Nor were those Hemispheres sham'd by his Eyes, Which the best Stars above dar'd not despise. 77 All Roses blush'd when near his lips they came, Whose purer Crimson, and whose sweeter Breath They thought (and well they might) their double shame; No Lilly ever met him in his path, But dreading his pure hand, in reverent fright Grew pale to see it self outvy'd in white. 78 The portly Cedars whose high mounted pitch O'r all the Trees advanc'd them to be Princes, Envy'd this stripling's lower stature, which Degraded their aspiring excellencies: The tallest lankness shows not half so high In Beautie's scale, as graceful Symmetry. 79 Thus tho' compounded all of lovely Charms, No wanton mixture did his sweets deflower: With gentle gravity his looks he arms; And, as the Heaven is Heaven altho' it lour, So are his graces still themselves, tho' He Invelop them in serious Chastity. 80 His noble Sire, renownèd Jacob was, Not by the Wife whose blear and watery eye Did its dim self bewail, and was the glass In which the World read her deformity: But by fair Her, who tho' she cost him twice Seven years hard service, low he thought the price. 81 He Rachel's Son, and her best Graces heir For her dear sake, but much more for his own, Sate precious next his Father's Soul; whose care Was bent his own delights in him to crown. He lov'd his Children all, yet far above The rest, his Joseph he did love to love. 82 (Joseph, whose strangely forward Soul would not Wait the dull leisure of Experience to Conduct him in the paths of Knowledge, but Speeded by Heaven did Time's own pace outgo; Thus proving in his bud maturely sage, And long in Wisdom, e'er in years of age.) 83 He hunts about the proudest World to buy The choice of purest and of brightest Cloth Brisk in the Tyrian and Sidonian dye, As due to his fair Darling: seeming loth That fewer Colors should embrave his Coat Than all the World in him did Beauties note. 84 Yet when the starry Peacock doth display His train's full Orb, the wingèd People all Disgracèd into anger and dismay Let their out-sparkled Plumes sullenly fall: So Joseph's Robes which his sweet self adorn, His Brethren cloath with shame and ireful scorn. 85 And is pert He alone, said murmuring They, His Father's lawfully-begotten Child, And we By-blows? Or must his Boyship prey On all our Seniorities? How wild A Hysteron Proteron's this, which Nature crosses, And far above the top the bottom tosses! 86 'Tis true, our partial Father, tho' he were The puny Brother, yet right slily did Into that Blessing steal, to which the Heir Was doubtless born: but yet by craft he sped, And not by Right: had Isaac had his eyes As Jacob now, sure he'd have been more wise. 87 But tho' the old Man loves his lucky cheat So well, that he upon his younger Son Throws all his Heart: We hope no want of Meat Shall force us willingly to be undone; Nor any Pottage this fond Boy can dress, Our Birth-right buy of the least He of Us. 88 Thus they repin'd; (not knowing there was writ Upon Heaven's Adamantine leaves a Law, By which this scorn'd Youth was decreed to sit In first-born Reuben's noble Chair, and grow Like an imperial Branch, whose teeming Root Dips in a living Fount its blessèd foot.) 89 Nor could his Innocencie's gentle charms Prevent the tempest of their groundless hate: For Brotherly salutes, with froward storms Of scornful language they his patience beat: And what they dar'd not venture with their Swords Of Steel, they try to do by those of Words. 90 Yet in the sweetness of simplicity Ingenuous He tells them his sacred Dream: From off my Bed by active Fancy I Hurry'd into the open Field did seem; And well my journie's pains were paid, for she With your dear company there blessèd me. 91 To work we fell, and reap'd the Field, and bound Our Sheafs; which strangely started all upright, Mine in the midst, yours in a decent round: Mine fixèd stood, yours seiz'd with awful fright Their reverential heads did all incline, And render meek obeysance unto mine. 92 This word his Brethren stung, who stamp'd and bit Their ireful lips; but yet could not bite in Their indignation, whose high torrent split Their foaming Mouths: and must, said they, thy fine Fancies usurp and reign, and by a trick Down into vile contempt thy Betters kick? 93 Proud Brat, know'st thou what meek Obeysance is? How dares thy upstart Insolence but dream That we thy Elders must bow down and kiss Thy Boyish foot, and tremble at thy Name? Believe it Child, 'tis not thy gewgaw Coat, (Tho' too too princely for thy back) can do't. 94 Altho' thus smartly check'd, Heaven-spurrèd He Dreads not his second Dream to represent; Yet wisely takes the opportunity Of Jacob's presence, that their Discontent Aw'd by their Father's looks, might cooler grow, And civil audience to him allow. 95 Then, misconstructions to forestall, he thrice Bows down; and cries, Dread Sire, and Brethren dear, When this last night had sealèd up mine eyes, And open'd Heaven's, whose countenance now was clear, And trimm'd with every Star; on his soft wing A nimble Vision me did thither bring. 96 Quite thro' the Store-House of the Air I past Where choice of every Weather treasur'd lies: Here Rains are bottled up; there Hail is cast In candy'd heaps; here banks of Snow do rise; There Furnaces of Lightning burn, and those Longbearded Stars which light us to our Woes. 97 Hence towr'd I to a dainty World: the Air Was sweet and calm, and in my memory Wak'd my serener Mother's looks: this fair Canaan now fled from my discerning eye; The Earth was shrunk so small, methought I read By that due prospect, what it was indeed. 98 But then arriving at an Orb whose flames Like an unbounded Ocean flow'd about; Fool as I was, I quak'd; till its kind beams Gave me a harmless kiss. I little thought Fire could have been so mild; but surely here It rageth, 'cause we keep it from its Sphere. 99 There, reverend Sire, it flam'd, but with as sweet An ardency as in your noble Heart That Heavenly Zeal doth burn, whose fostering heat Makes you Heaven's living Holocaust: no part Of my Dream's tender wing felt any harm; Our journey, not the fire, did keep us warm. 100 But here my Guide, his wings soft oars to spare, On the Moon's lower horn clap'd hold, and whirl'd Me up into a Region, as far In splendid worth surmounting this low World, As in its place: for liquid Crystal here Was the tralucid matter of each Sphere. 101 The Moon was kind, and as we scourèd by Shew'd us the Deed, whereby the great Creator Instated her in that large Monarchy She holdeth over all the Ocean's water: To which a Schedule was annex'd, which o'er All other humid Bodies gives her power. 102 Now complemental Mercury was come To the quaint margin of his courtly sphere, And bid us eloquent welcome to his Home: Scarce could we pass, so great a crowd was there Of Points and Lines; and nimble Wit beside Upon the backs of thousand shapes did ride. 103 Next Venus's face, heav'n's joy and sweetest pride, (Which brought again my Mother to my mind,) Into her Region lur'd my ravish'd Guide: This strew'd with Youth and Smiles and Love we find, And those all chast: 'tis this foul World below Adulterates what from thence doth spotless flow. 104 Then rapt to Phebus's Orb, all pav'd with gold, The rich reflection of his own Aspect: Most gladly there I would have staid and told How many Crowns and Thrones his Dwelling deckt, What Life, what Verdure, what Heroic Might, What pearly Spirits, what Sons of active Light. 105 But I was hurried into Mars his sphere, Where Envy (O how curs'd was its grim face!) And Jealousy, and Fear, and Wrath, and War Quarrel'd, although in heaven, about their place. Yea, Engins there to vomit fire I saw, Whose flame and thunder Earth at length must know. 106 Nay in a corner 'twas my hap to spy Something which look'd but frowardly on Me: And sure my watchful Guide read in mine ey My musing troubled sence; for straitway He Least I should start and wake upon the fright, Speeded from thence his seasonable flight. 107 Welcome was Jupiter's Dominion, where Illustrious Mildness round about did flow; Religion had built her Temple there, And Sacred Honors on its Walks did grow: No Mitre ever Priest's grave head shall crown, Which in those mystic Gardens was not sown. 108 At length we found old Saturn in his bed; And much I wonder'd how an He so dull Could climb thus high; His house was lumpish Lead, Of dark and solitary corners full; Where Discontent, and Sickness dwellers be, Damn'd Melancholy, and dead Lethargy. 109 Hasting from hence into a boundless field, Innumerable Starrs we marshall'd found In fair array: This Earth did never yield Such choice of floury Pride; when she had crown'd The plains of Shechem, where the gaudy Spring Smiles in the beauties of each verdant thing. 110 This was our journie's end: but here began A stranger Pageant than all those before: I, who till now Spectator was, must in The glorious Masque an Actor be, or more Than so: I still am pos'd about the case, But wiser you shall judge; and thus it was: 111 A knot of Lights constellated into A radiant Throne, on which my self was set: When lo, the Sun and Moon themselves did throw Into obsequious duty at my feet; And then eleven great Stars thought it no shame To couch before me who admirèd them. 112 But shame I thought it for poor Me to take Homage of Starrs, who was but Dust and Clay; Big with excuse I grew, and 'gan to speak, But then my Dream took wing and fled away.— And fly thou after it, bold Dreamer, cry'd His Brethren, who in Dreams dost mask thy Pride. 113 Sage Jacob, though he ponder'd every word In's own prophetic heart, and judg'd the Dream Not fram'd by Joseph, but by Joseph's Lord; Expedient thought it something wroth to seem; Finding no readier way that Rage to smother He saw smoke from his Sons against their Brother. 114 But Child, said He, where is that blush of thine Which us'd to paint meek Virtue on thy face! How dar'st thou tell a Dream which doth design Unto thy puny Self such Sovereign place? Think'st thou thy Brethren and thy Parents must Crouch to young thee, and lick thy footsteps' dust? 115 Or dream no more, or thy fond Dream conceal, If any fancy rise which may offend: On this condition I thy pardon seal, And all thy Brothers shall their quarrel end. Go you my Sons, be careful of my sheep: This Boy at home as meek as them I'll keep. 116 And so he did: for little pains it cost To tutor Him whom Virtue long ago Espousèd had; the Care he found which most Busied his loving tenderness, was to Prevent his being made that Mischief's prey Which rankling in his Brothers bosoms lay. 117 Dear Joseph see thy caution be no less Than in thine Innocence; take heed how these Thy Brethrens Anger thou, said he, dost press, Least its rebound thine own blood out do squeeze. I know their furies, and from whence they move: O that their ground of Hate should be my Love! 118 Hast thou not mark'd how if a flint we lay Soft on a downy bed, and gently smite; Its conquer'd stubborness gives willing way: But harshly usèd, it defies our might, And spits its sudden rage in fire, nor shall The stoutest hammer cool its wrath at all. 119 Those bosoms of my Sons sure cannot be More hard than Hardness, and the Flint's stiff heart: Or if my charity deceiveth me, Thy Mildness must be temper'd with such art As may the softness of that Down exceed Which on the Cygnet's dainty neck is bred. 120 When they begin to bluster, give them way; T'has often cost the boldest Cedar dear To grapple with a Storm; whilst flow'rs which lay Their weak heads low in meek and trembling fear, Waiting the leisure of the Wind, again Rise up unbruis'd, and see the Cedars slain. 121 Thus I of late thy furious Unkle met, Whose Indignation I had kindled by More than a Dream; and made him vow that great Affront with no less vengance upon my Head to return, and in a murderous fit Tear back his Birthright, and my life with it. 122 With droves of Presents, the best bribes of wrath, I meekly block'd up his Revenge's way: With gentlest phrases I bestrew'd his path; Seven times before his feet I prostrate lay; And by submission so superior grew, That from the jaws of Rage untouch'd I flew. 123 And now, sweet Child, 'cause many days are gone Since sullen they went hence; lest they surmise I treasure all my Joys in thee alone, Feasting mine own on thy all-lovely eyes; To morrow thou unto their Folds shalt go, And in their Father's name see how they do. 124 The virtuous Youth of this Commission glad Thought the nocturnal hours all clogg'd with lead; Fir'd by ingenuous Zeal, such hast he made That Time seem'd unto him asleep in bed: And since his thoughts afore were marchèd, He No longer patience has behind to be. 125 Long e'er the Morn her eylids had withdrawn And op'd the East into its hopes of day, Up was he got and drest, and by his own Fair eyes being lighted well on in his way; Conning Submission's language as he went, And plotting how his Brethren to content. 126 But by the various beauties of his Coat Discerning him from farr, Behold, said they, The saucy Dreamer comes; and since w' have got Free help of time and place our foe to slay, Wisdom commands us to prevent in time That Tyranny to which his Pride doth climb. 127 O no, cries Reuben (one in whose mild heart More genuine drops of Jacob's blood did thrill,) He is a Child, and acts but his own part: Dreams are but flitting toys; but if we spill His harmless blood, the spot upon our head Will be no Dream, believ't, but Guilt indeed. 128 O rather give him to yon' gaping pit, That he from you may only have his grave: Let Fate's sure wrath, or wild Beast's fury fit Him with a death, and bury in that Cave Your less offence: doubtless no Stars will bow To him whom from the sight of heaven you throw. 129 Whilst Reuben thus with cruel-looking Love Him from the worst of rage plots to secure; The gentle Stripling near was drawn, and strove With lowly winning gestures to allure Kind entertainment: but alas in vain; Desert swells Envy up with more disdain. 130 As hungry Wolves upon the helpless Lamb, Upon him strait they rush, who fruitlesly Ran o'er all blandishments sweet Wit could frame To tune their harsh Wrath to mild Concord's key: With loud revilings his meek Prayers they drown, And stripp'd, into the deep pit throw him down. 131 Down Joseph sunk; and up went their proud Cry In Scorn's ignoble triumph: See, said they, How low our Loyal Sheaves couch down to thy Imperial Bundle: See how flat we lay Our twinkling trembling Stars before the bright Effusions of thy dread and royal Light. 132 O that the old and crazy Moon and Sun Should now forgetful of their duties be, And let their Wheels in any Circle run But that which might their homage roul to thee! Thus flouted they, and heartned one another Lower to plunge their most dejected Brother. 133 But then a troop of Merchants passing by, They money of more precious Joseph make: The thrifty Ishmaelites admirèd why For such rich Ware they would so little take: No new-digg'd Pearl such fair beams ever shot As beauteous He drawn from his mirey grot. 134 Yet twenty silver pieces was his price, Which soon they paid; and now were sure they bore To Memphis's Mart far richer Merchandise Than all their swelling Packs of Midian store. And thus the Saint a slave to strangers is, As were his Brethren to strange Avarice. 135 Yet fold they not his Coat: With this said they, As Jacob vex'd us, We'll vex Him again. There innocent Brother's pattern then they slay, A gentle Kid; with whose meek blood they stain The Robe; which thus unto their Sire was sent Blushing for them, whose own shame all was spent. 136 And soon He knew't. O me, the good Man cries, It is my Joseph's Coat, all wildely rent, And Bloody too: Be free my weeping eyes, Y' have nothing now to do but to lament: That only Day which joy'd and blest your sight, My Darling's face lies burièd in night. 137 Ah sadly-precious Relict! and were all Thy glorious Colours not enough without This fatal too-too-costly Crimson! shall I by my Joy's choice Livery be taught Only my Sorrows to remember, and By the torn fleece my Lamb's death understand! 138 Dear Coat, behold I rend mine own with thee, Less, O less worthy to be whole than thou. Sure some wild beast thy Master tore, and me Together with him, though I felt not how. Unrighteous partial Beast, which didst forbear Me in my old less worthy self to tear. 139 Sweet Child, I hop'd to have prevented thee In seeing Rachel thy deceasèd Mother: But surely long behind I will not be, Thy death brings grief enough my life to smother; I'll come as fast as an old Man can go, And see you both: Peace Friends, it must be so. 140 But holy Joseph now to Egypt brought, Is set to sale; where Potiphar, the head Of Pharaoh's guard, the goodly Stripling bought; And in's ingenuous countenance having read Pure characters of Worth, he doubted not All freest Trust in his fair Slave to put. 141 Nor did the issue ever flag below His expectation; for fidelity, For care, for prudence, his Example now The only Rule to all the rest must be: Each Servant daily is admonishèd To mind his charge, as trusty Joseph did. 142 But how could they keep pace with Him, who through Successe's paths was led, and hastned by Heaven's constant prosperous hand, Earth knew not how! Which when his wondring Master did descry, With pious Wisdom thus concluded He: My Servant has some greater Lord than Me. 143 Contented therefore only with the Name Of Master, Him he trusts with every key Of highest charge, impow'ring him to Frame As he thought best, his whole Oeconomy. Thus did this unknown Slave the Lord become Though not of his own Lord, yet of his Home. 144 Lord of his Home, yet more his Servant still Than all his numerous Family beside: High was his Place, but Lowliness did fill It to the top: Thus He on Honor's tide Was more securely born, by striving how Against the envy-breeding stream to row. 145 But whilst this wonderous Steward doth allure All other eyes to reverential Love; His Mistresse's grew sick of an impure And black disease: which did it self improve To such foul strength, that now abroad it flies Like Basilisk's beams, to poison neighbour eyes. 146 Deep was it bred in that invenom'd Lake, Which in hell's bottom stinks; from whence a Fiend It in a red hot vial up did rake, And by unfelt degrees profoundly blend With fair Potiphera's blood; whose tainted veins Were strait made chanels of Lust's boiling pains. 147 Though Joseph's virtue might aforehand be Assurance of denial, yet her flame With such impatient fury burnt, that she All amorous enchantments brews to tame His rigid heart. Lust ne'r despairs to try A duel in Wit's field with Chastity. 148 What ever word inhanceth Joseph's praise, Her Echo doubles it, and doth supply Some more pathetic and transcendent phrase To raise his Merit to a pitch so high, That He oblig'd in modesty might seem To Her to render what she heap'd on Him. 149 Of partial Fortune she did oft complain Who with no Crown rewarded Joseph's brow: Then that Complaint as oft retract again, And cry: Her boons let foolish Fortune throw On worthless heads; more glorious 'tis by far A Diadem to merit, than to wear. 150 With many a courtly wile she pry'd and sifted, His parentage and family to find: All which when prudent He more subtly shifted; In fawning discontent she cry'd, unkind Can Sweetness prove, and not inform us where That fair Stock grows whose Branches wonders are! 151 If any bit were choice, she thought it due To Joseph's palate more than to her own: The rarest flowers which in her garden grew Must out be cull'd, and wreathd into a crown, Or some quaint posie, which herself invents, And in a smile each morn to him presents. 152 Go's He abroad? with longing eye she still Doth to the furthest prospect him pursue; And sadly counts the tedious minutes till His wish'd return doth feast her hungry view: His shadow's bliss she envies, which hath free Leave his dear Bodie's Follower to be. 153 Stays he at home? not all the world can call Her thoughts abroad: some pretty quaint pretences She duly finds to be concern'd in all Her Steward's business; and with speaking glances Labors to intimate, that she has more Delicious work for lovely him in store. 154 If he be well, she dares not but be so: If he be sick, she scorneth to be well; And yet about him will be busy too, To hold his head, or hand, his cup to fill, His meat to dress, but most his bed to warm, And watch all night that Joseph take no harm. 155 Creeps Chillness on him? She foments and heats His flesh, but more profoundly burns her own. The precious dew, if feaverish he but sweats, She wipes, and treasures up in amorous lawn. Thus hot or cold, some way she doth devise To feast on him her Touch as well's her Eyes. 156 And more significant that Touch she makes By odd and sudden pressures, which Design Taught Chance to counterfeit: deep-laid mistakes She covers with Solicitude, and in Wary hypocrisy lets slip her hand Much farther than she seem'd to understand. 157 Then by officious carelesness her own Robe she instructs how to betray her skin; And strait corrects that error of her gown, Yet studiously lets it err again; By this sly dalliance of the crafty bait Hoping what she could not subdue, to cheat. 158 O with what thankful hecatombs did she The Altars load, if from the smallest ache Joseph were freed: yet that Idolatry With which her Gods she flattered, could not match This which at Joseph's shrine she daily paid; More of his anger, than of Heav'ns afraid. 159 Whate'r she sees, or sweet, or rich, or rare, She something in his Person findeth still To which those precious things must not compare: And in impatient Lust's bold-boiling zeal At last she cries, How blessèd should I be, If Potiphar were such an one as Thee! 160 He ken'd that treacherous Language for a while No more than do's the Lark the Fowler's pipes. But when he 'gan to smell her dangerous wile Now by its stink betrayed; off he wipes That praise's froth which she so thick did strow, And by his own Blush taught Her what to do. 161 But dull to that hard lesson finding Her, To Heav'n's tuition he commends her heart: His own sweet Looks then souring with severe Sternness, against Lust's shaft he throws the dart Of Continence; and by neglected Dress Feigns, what he could not make, Unloveliness. 162 Never did Slovenry more misbecome Nor more confute its nasty self than here: The Sun in dusky clouds, in dirt a Gemm, Of Joseph now but faint half-emblemes were; So stoutly his oppressèd Beauty got The victory o'r its incourag'd Blot. 163 This forc'd Him virtuously to undermine His graceful virtue, and grow plainly rude. Yet Rudeness too in Joseph fair did shine, And by repulses drew what he eschew'd: She, like the Ball, the stoutlier on the ground 'Tis thrown, with greater zeal doth back rebound. 164 In's Lady's ear at length right wisely He High Panegyrics of his Master made, And magnify'd her rare felicity Who Virtue's own Spouse to her Husband had: But signally above his other praises, That of his constant Chastity he raises. 165 This Word of all the rest, most deeply stung Her unchast heart: She now resolves, no more To rack her self within, but plainly bring To light her soul's dark torments, and before Her Steward's face her wounded bosome ope, That Pity him might force those wounds to stop. 166 His shyness to surprize industrious she Having an ambush in her garden laid; Fortune, the friend of vice, and enemy Of virtuous Worth, Him to her wish betray'd: Where, Serpent-like in Paradise, she over Her foul Design spread this fair-facèd cover: 167 Sweet Sir, said she, though Wit's own Pride you are, In our Egyptian Hieroglyphics you Seem yet but little studied; wherefore here I'm come to be your Tutoress, and bestow My dearest skill; being grievèd much to see You in the best of Arts unlearn'd should be. 168 The dialect of that tenderness and praise I showrèd thick upon you day by day, You understood not, though ten thousand-ways I try'd to speak it plain: And what I pray, Meant all that sweet ado, but only this, Potiphera in love with Joseph is? 169 Nay, start not at the word, nor think that thy Affected sourness can thy sweets imbitter: Dear Hypocrite, I know thy plot, and by Love's Powers I swear, thy value grows but greater By that contraction: Thus heaven's Tapers are So much the higher as they less appear. 170 Just, just my Passion is; and hear how I With solid arguments can make it good: 'Tis sacrilege to let Divinity Pass by unlov'd: yon banks of Nilus's flood Did ne'r Serapis half so God-like see, As this more blessèd garden's walks do thee. 171 Which as thou traversest, thou by the way The choisest flowers instructest with thine eye How to look brisk and brave, how to display Some pretty beam of amorous Majesty: By their steps dainty copy thy fair feet Teach all the Beds of Spices to grow sweet. 172 When on yon crystal Fount thou deignst to look, It tickles the soft Nymph to think that she Is by thy self each evening made the book Where thy sweet face thou printest. Wo is me, Why was not I a Fountain too, that thou Thy dear impression might'st on me bestow! 173 That Appletree's fresh ruddy Sons, which in Their mother's arms so delicately smile, Less approbation from wise judges win Than thy plump cheeks, which such full graces swell, That had my soul's best longing leave to choose, My tast should banquet on no fruits but those. 174 Right lovely are those arms that courteous Vine About her strait-embracèd Elm doth throw: But how much, how much pleasanter are thine! In whose blest bands were I a Pris'ner now, Not all heav'n's high temptations should on me Prevail once to accept of liberty. 175 Wouldst count me wanton, if I long'd to kiss That youthful Rose, which looks inchantments there? Yet his soft ruby lips themselves confess Dusky and harsh, when they with thine compare. And is't a Crime, to wish that Kiss which poses The purest complement of virgin Roses? 176 That Nightingale which hants yon cypress grove I thought th'Intelligence of Music's sphere; Till thy more charming Accents did reprove My monstrous error: And if but to hear Inamoring thee, such ravishment doth steal Into my heart, what would it do to feel? 177 Long did my Husband woo the Gods, to gain Their blessing on his pining stock; yet he Did still as needy as devout remain, Untill he thrivèd by diviner Thee. Judge then what reason I have to inshrine And honor now no Deity but thine. 178 And sure I'm orthodox in this, and dare Dispute it with the graveliest-cheating Priest: For house and home those Gods beholden are Plainly to Us: but We our selves are blest With rich subsistence by thy influence: Thus We keep our Gods, but Thou, Thou keepest Us. 179 Hath Nature any beauteous Piece to make On which her credit stands ingagèd? She Distrusting her own fancy's power, doth take Her copy from Perfection in Thee. O, wouldst thou fall to work thy self, above All Rarities must thy Productions prove. 180 The Morn betimes repaireth to thine eye, And asks what weather heaven shall have that day: In vain the Clouds combine to damp the sky, If thou thy Face's sunshine dost display: If thou but lowr'st, in vain the foolish Air Forceth it self to smile, and to look fair. 181 What fools our Scholars are, their time, and care, And brains upon the Stars above to spend, Searching the Seasons which are hatching there! 'Tis Heresy, say I, but to ascend Above the Orb of thine illustrious Eye, The fairest book of best Astronomy. 182 This way no Winds from blest Arabia trade, But from thy mouth snatch thy more balmy Breath Into their own; and as they forward speed, With gallant Odours all perfume their path. The world admires whence such rich Blasts should fly; But none the sweet Original know, but I. 183 For strange ev'n to thy self thou needs wilt be, And take no notice how all Excellence In thee alone doth hold its Monarchy. I tell thee Dear, 'tis but a fond pretence Which thou call'st Modesty, and might undo thee, If Providence had not sent me unto thee. 184 Let me be bold, that so I may be loyal; Duty, not Envy, spurs me now to speak: And if my Zeal be check'd with a Denyal, (Which Love forbid!) yet shall thy stern mistake But whet the edge of my fidelity, Since none dare tell thee of this fault but I. 185 Canst dream wise Heaven's strange Bounty ever meant To plant the best of all its store in thee, There to ly hid and dy, and not be spent In their free course of natural Charity? Let those be Chast, who can no love invite; 'Twere sin in thee, created for delight. 186 Indeed the other Phœnix knowing none Of his own feathered kind, is fain to spend His virgin love upon himself alone, And hatch his life's beginning by its end: His amorous flames kill and revive him so, That to himself he's Son and Father too. 187 But Thou, as rich and fair a thing as He, Hast fitter fuel for thy fire: Lo here I ready drièd am with thirst to be Its sacrifice; and will thy bed prepare With such life-breeding sweets, as shall contest With all the spices of the Phœnix nest. 188 In this dear pile of Aromatic love We'l burn together and vie flame with flame: Why may this Bonfire not mount far above The Phœnix's in more renownèd fame; With much discreeter fervency reprieving The old, and life to a new Joseph giving? 189 To my contrivement leave the welcome care Of making sure that he, and none but he To Potiphar's estate do prove the heir. Indeed, plain Justice calls for this; since we Owe all our wealth to thee, whose child can merit But only thine, that portion to inherit? 190 Why stay we then? The good-Man's now from home, As he is from my heart; which both are thine. Fear not this glaring Day; I'l make Night come With one quick twitch, and cloud up our design: Close are my Curtains, and no tales they tell; Come then, my dearer self, all shall be well. 191 So foam'd hot Lust from her hell-kindled heart. But sober Joseph (though youth's nimble flame Leap'd in his sanguine breast,) well knew the part Of cool chast Gravity, and how to tame If not her fury, yet what ever heat Could Lust's wild March in his own bosome beat. 192 Madam, no hast; since you vouchafe, said He, All love to me, of all love hear me speak: To travel in Successe's company Hast has no patience; but delights to make Her pace so fierce and violently mad As quite outruns all fortune but the bad. 193 Chiefly when Passion cheats her of her sight, Concealing all the dangers of the way; So that her wildfires flames afford no light But desperate darkness to her passage. Say, Say then, can headlong Lust a good end find When both her self, and her fond God are blind? 194 Were they not so, how couldst thou me invite To those strange Joys that must lie sneaking in Thy guilty curtains, and avoid heav'n's light, As too too fair a witness for a sin So foul and hellish. Thus aforehand thou Ashamèd art of what thou fain wouldst do. 195 Call hither but thy Men or Maids; or walk With me into the Market-place, and there Try if thou dar'st that ugly motion make: O no! Thy Rhetoric's best wardrobe ne'r Will furnish thee with any dress so spruce As may in others ears this filth excuse. 196 Did I those high elogiums merit, thou Didst gild me with, I could return them back As arguments against thy suit: For how Can such bright beauty choose to grow so black! Such prodigies are past: No more must Evil Hope of a Lucifer to make a Devil. 197 True, I a Slave was to my Master brought, And unto You in him; but not to Lust: Yet my Desert, or his mistake, hath wrought So great a change, that in my single trust He treasures up his numerous Family, Whereof He Father, I must Ruler be. 198 Thus gave he me my freedom from the bands Of Vassallage, but not of Virtue too. O no; this obligation stricter stands, And Joseph must more hearty homage do To Potiphar, than meanest they who lie Still fetter'd in the sink of slavery. 199 Trusty obedience is all their debt, But most ingenuous Loyalty is mine: Their limbs and labours he did purchase, but My heart and soul: And O what more divine Distinction of our duties can you have! They to his Power, I to his Love am Slave. 200 Seest that fair Sun, to whom his God hath given The free dispensing of his stock of Light To all the starry Family of heaven? When that high Steward can his Master slight, Then (nay not then) the copy hope to see Of that Ingratitude transcrib'd by me. 201 Himself my Lord ne'r gave into my hand, Therefore not Thee, who art but one with Him: Nor could he do it, since so close a band Do's cement you together, that no limb Of his own Body Nature's hand did join Nearer unto himself than is all thine. 202 O wish me not so barbarous as to tear Him from himself, and rend you both in sunder. If needs I must be faithless, be it there Where I may nothing but his Fortunes plunder. What Cheat is more inhuman, than to seem To spare his Goods, and yet imbezil Him? 203 Except the venerable Temples, what Place is more reverend than the Nuptial Bed? Nay heav'n has made a Temple too of that For Chastitie's most secret Rites: and did I violate its sanctity, no less Than sacrilegious, were that wickedness. 204 In vain thou plead'st, that Potiphar's away: He's so to none but those who serve his eye; And therefore all the while they him obey, Obey not him, but base necessity. True Duty's Master at her loyal hand When He's abroad, as well's at home, doth stand. 205 But grant Him absent: still God's round about, And in the midst, between ev'n Me and Thee; His eye needs make no search to spy us out, Which Us before we were at all, did see. I would not wrong My Master, but much less Injure that God, who is my Lord and His. 206 A Lord whose Indignation is attended By all heav'n's thundering artillery: A Lord whom wilful Rebel ne'r offended With safe and unrevengèd villany. A Lord whom did not Pow'r make awful, yet His Goodness might our reverence beget. 207 A Lord so pure, that we may saflier gaze Upon the burnish'd Sun's meridian beams, Than he his eye can fasten on God's face; A face whence such excess of lustre streams, That He in mercy casts on Us below A veil, which though We cannot, He looks through. 208 He looks through that, and through all Curtains too Which we upon our selves and sins would draw. Far be that fondness then, that we should go Seeking some secret hole to break His Law, And there no less expose to his bright Eye The foulest of all spots, Adultery. 209 A spot which me so black would make, that thou, Who with such loving fury me dost woo, For mere deformity wouldst never know Me more, but scorn'd and hated let me go: So would I do my self, and never stay With Joseph, knew I how to run away. 210 Yet with so much more hideousness that spot, Madam, in you would stare, as you exceed In beautie's choicest wealth: We wonder not When dusky moles in Luna's cheeks we read; But should Sol's face such foul incroachments wear, Each mole would prove a Mount of blackness there. 211 O be what happily you are, be what All other Ladies emulate in vain: And since your Goodliness admits no blot, Still let your Virtue too indure no stain: At least let not your slave that monster be Who must defile such noble purity. 212 Ask or command me what you please beside: If you'l dispatch me to the furthest Sea, To fetch you Pearls; the Sun shall not out-ride My restless course, nor any Jewels be Treasur'd so deep in the profoundest main, But I will dig them thence and come again. 213 Or speak the word, and I'l revenge your wrong On these bold sweets of my inchanting face Which have abus'd and tempted you so long: These nails of mine shall those fair charms erase, And plow such ghastly wounds, as strait shall heal All those, my beauty made your bosom feel. 214 I'l soon transform my self into a state Which more your Pity, than your Love, shall crave: Or if this truer Love of mine you hate, Some where or other I shall find a grave; And there with greater comfort rest my head, Than if I slept on your delicious bed. 215 My grave's worst worms can never deeper gnaw Than this poor flesh: but in thy bed will breed One so rapacious, as quite through and through My heart will eat, and on my conscience feed. Ah Madam—Here, what he had more to say Sighs cutting off, he sadly turn'd away. 216 As when a mighty Torrent hasting on, Is by some sturdy Bank check'd in his way; The waters roar, and foam, and swell upon Themselves, for spight at their proud journy's stay; So did Potiphera's heart, whose lustful course Unshaken, Joseph back again did force. 217 A thousand Passions boyling in her breast Raise up a Tempest of rebellious flames; Whose Tide disdaining what did it resist, Beats with themselves its unsuccesful streams; Till miserably wrack'd, most woful she Quite sinks in this self-torment's monstrous Sea. 218 Fair Day to her seems nothing but a mist Through which no hopes can dawn on her desire: Still Night, which to all others sealeth rest, Wakes and alarms her heart-consuming fire: Whether she walks, or sits, or stands, or lies, Her wretched self still in her self she fries. 219 She finds no relish in the daintiest meat, But only on distracted fancies feeds: The spicèd wine, to other palates sweet, Mocks her's alone, and odious loathing, breeds; Thick sighs and tears from her swoln mouth and eyes Echo the storms, which in her bosom rise. 220 With her most pliant bed of fawning down No wrath of thorns in sharpness may compare, Because her husband (now too much her own) And not her Joseph, her joy's Spouse, is there. Ah my dear Psyche, where, ah where may we With Heavenly love a soul thus wounded see! 221 Oft she renew'd her suit, but su'd in vain: Till faint and sick, at last she asks him how He would her murder answer? Such a stain Will scarce become, said she, thy lovely brow; Deep in th'unnatural furrows of whose frown The seeds of my unhappy death are sown. 222 But finding him still, like the constant Rock, Fix'd firm upon his solid Chastity; Her final resolution she awoke, And all her passionate strength with it, that she Might now correct her scornèd Love's mishap By valiant managing her plotted Rape. 223 Shall squeamish He my Pleasure's harvest, by Fond superstitious coyness thus prevent? Since by my softness he grows harder, I By Toughness now must teach him to relent: I must, cry'd she; there's now no way but one; Though he will not be woo'd, he shall be won. 224 Fool as I was, to sigh, and weep, and whine Out long complaints, and pine my self away. Just Fate doth Cowards' projects countermine, Whilst only venturous Courage gets the day. Love's Bow and Quiver signify that he Is friend to none but such as warlike be. 225 Resolvèd thus, her former withering hope Into proud forward confidence did flourish; And perchèd now upon Presumption's top Her Lust with fancy she mean while doth nourish, Until the fit and lucky season might Her freely to the real feast invite. 226 Which Invitation often chid by her, And challengèd of leaden-pac'd delay, At length appear'd, when tedious Potiphar And all her tell-tale servants were away. She welcom'd it, as fierce flames do their fuel, And flew with raging joy unto her duel. 227 For having caught her Joseph all alone, She Harpie-like clap'd one bold tallon fast Upon those Cloaths she wish'd had not been on: Her other Arm about his neck she cast: Loose was her coat, bewraying more than He Desir'd to view, or I to tell to thee. 228 My Pris'ner then she cries, art thou, as I Have long been thine, though thou didst scorn thy Prize; But better use of thy Captivity I vow to make: Thou shalt no more despise My Prayers, for I Command thee now to be Whether thou wilt or no, happy with me. 229 Since you no other Arguments would trust Of my Love's strength, this Act shall make it plain. Know that this battel is my first, nor must You dream that I'l turn Warrier in vain. I but supply your part; 'tis fit that when The Males will not, the Females play the Men. 230 Perhaps thy needless maiden modesty Stay'd by thy Lover to be ravish'd; for Your nicer Beauties, though they long to be As kind as love can wish, seem to abhorr Assent's free plainness, and all tricks devise How to be Plunder's, not Persuasion's prize. 231 Lo then, that feat is done; as far at least As may secure your Credit's Jealousy. But if my loyal love you still resist; Behold, I deeply swear by Thee, by Thee (Whom yet I only worship,) that no blood, But from thy heart, shall make that damage good. 232 Not of that lukewarm Mediocrity You dull-soul'd Men mistake for Virtue, but Of brave Excess we Women temper'd be: Our Spirits are all Superlatives; and what Extremities exalt our Loves, the same Will blow up our provok'd Revenge's flame. 233 Loud I'l exclaim, and tell the Houshold how With lustful force thou here surprizèdst Me: This monstrous Crime will cost thy life; for know My Lye can soon out-face thy verity. Hadst thou not better take thy pleasure here, Than be for nothing, judg'd a Ravisher? 234 Whilst thus her rampant Passion boilèd, He Wisely considerèd, that no cool Reply Could slack its rage: the Storm to that degree Was swollen now so desperately high, That venturing any longer stay to make, Was but to run upon a certain wrack. 235 He therefore through close paths of wary hast, Hunts his escape; and loosning secretly His upper garment, which she grasp'd so fast, Leaves that to her, and out himself doth fly. The wise and watchful Serpent thus knows when 'Tis fit to stop her ear, and cast her skin. 236 But she with such an hideous outcry tears Her throat, that all th'amazèd family Into her Chamber brings their staring fears; Where on her bed, heaving a woful sigh, Behold, said she, this garment: which of you Would think the Hebrew Slave so bold should grow? 237 He thought, because his Master was from home, My Faith had been so too: He thought that he Might as his Lord's Vicegerent freely come And challenge right ev'n to my chastity. 'Twas time to cry: which I no sooner did, But he, the guilty hypocrite, was fled. 238 He fled, but left for fearful hast behind That pledge of his unfortunate impudence; For, confident he me should willing find, Off went the Villain's clothes. Come bear me hence From this curs'd place: but bring the Vest with me, That Potiphar his Darling's badge may see. 239 In desperate Revenge engagèd thus, Her spightful slander she contriveth how With every odious circumstance to dress, Which heaviest mischief might on Joseph throw; And Potiphar's return she covets more Than for his absence, she had long'd before. 240 When home he came, she met him with this Lye, And threw the garment to him for her proof. He took no sober time the cause to try, But judg'd that Argument more than enough. Joseph's to Prison sent; a place less warm To him, but sweeter than his Lady's arm. 241 Yet long he lay not loaded with his chains, But ev'n the Jaylor's heart the Pris'ner takes: Such potent sweetness still in Virtue reigns, That her Commanders She her Subjects makes. Heav'n would not suffer other bonds to yoke Him, who through all Lust's chains and charms had broke. 242 The Keeper now keeps nothing but his Name: The keys at Joseph's girdle hang, and he Is in this closer Stewardship the same He was in Potiphar's free Family; Nay more than so, no Mistress being here To make his Jayl as bad's his freedom there. 243 At length the guerdon of his worth drew near, And Dreams, th'occasions of his low estate, Assist him now in climbing Glory's sphere. The great Events ripe uncontrollèd Fate Was into Egypt suddenly to bring, Are in a mystic Vision shew'd the King. 244 Their curious brains the old Magicians beat About the Riddle, but were all too weak To pierce that mighty cloud wherein the great Secret inshrinèd lay: The King must seek Some wiser head; and who d'y' think was he? Joseph alone his Oracle could be. 245 Joseph, whose wisdom's strangely-searching beams Rose in the dazlèd Court's horizon, by Clearing the Butler's and the Baker's Dreams From mists of most profound obscurity: Joseph, who now from Prison's freed, that He May set the hamper'd thought of Pharaoh free. 246 And soon he taught Him what the Kine did mean Heaven shew'd him feeding upon Nilus's shore: Why seven were wondrous Fat, and seven as Lean; Which did portend the Famin, which the store; What sign grew in both kinds of Corn; What Cares Were requisite against the following Years. 247 Such full Conviction seiz'd th'astonish'd King, As left no entrance for the least Demurr: So plain, so consonant was every thing, That as on Heavn's sole Privy-Counseller He looks on Joseph; and thenceforth detests The dull-ey'd Magic of his cheating Priests. 248 First thanks to Heav'n, he cries, then thanks to thee In whom its spirit so clearly I descry. And who can better my assistant be Than Thou, who hold'st all Wisdom's Monarchy? The Throne and Sceptre shall continue mine; All Egypt else, and justly, shall be thine. 249 Which said; his royal Ring, his love to seal, On Joseph's hand he puts, and him invests With purest Linen: on his neck, which steel Had lately gall'd, a golden chain he casts; And then to him his second Chariot gave, Who lately into Egypt trudg'd a Slave. 250 What he had been to Potiphar before, What to the Jaylor; now he's to the King: The soverein Steward and Vicegovernor Of his whole Realm. And here true Heav'n did bring About full proof to justify his Dream, Whilst both his Sire and Brethren bow'd to Him. 251 Thus Chastity's pure King his Champion sees Amply repaid; who having got Command Of his own Flesh and Blood, can rule with ease A Kingdom's reins. Mark well and understand, Dear Psyche, this Narration's design. The Case which here was His, may once be Thine. 252 So spake the blessèd Guardian; and then His own on Psyche's lips clos'd with a Kiss. She strait her reverent thanks return'd him in Low-bowèd Modesty: and, warn'd by his, And by Time's Item, kindly took the hint, And to her wonted task of Prayers went. CANTO II. Lust Conquered. THE ARGUMENT. Lust, who in ambush lay, the Onset gives To careless Psyche, as she gads abroad: Charis the overpowered Maid relieves: Phylax unmasks the Fiend. Her penitent flood Psyche pours out, and is conducted by A Vision to the Court of Chastity. 1 No foolish Tinder ever strove to catch In its soft amorous arms the treacherous spark, And with such zealous rashness joy'd to hatch Its own destruction; as fond Man doth mark And treasure up those fair-fac'd Counsels, which With fatal charms his heedless heart bewitch. 2 No wretchèd Adder ever soder'd up His wilful ear with trustier cement; than With retchless obstinacy He doth stop His Memories unhappy portals, when Wholsom Advice with sweetness wooes it, and Long knocking for admission doth stand. 3 In self-destroying Vanity so much Is He engag'd, that He no leisure hath To listen after Bliss; but still of such Importance counts his Nothing, that 'tis death To harbor Life, and entertain those dear Counsels, which more than their own charges bear. 4 Or if strong Importunity (whereby The tenderest Drops are taught to pierce the Flint,) His sullen stiffness constantly doth ply, Perhaps he yieldeth to the dainty dint Of such unwearied Gentleness; which yet Her conquest more by stealth than force doth get. 5 But though at length a wicket ope he sets, His slighted Guest in some out-room he lays: But when vain Fancy, or Seduction beats Summons upon his gates, He strait displays Their way, and lets them quite thrust out of door The former Stranger, scarcely in before. 6 For as the honey of Heav'n's lovely hives, The Summer Clouds, snugging in laps of Flowers, That correspondent dwelling quickly leaves To churlish drops of less-deserving showers, Or rankling mildew, which such venome sheds As soon deflowereth all those Virgin beds: 7 So far'd it now with Psyche's careless breasts, On which more dainties drop'd from Phylax tongue Than e'r on Hybla made their verdent nest. Abroad she will, and please her self among The fields' wide sweets, forgetting that some wind Might steal upon, and blast her honied mind. 8 Abroad she will, because she understands Not truly what it is to be abroad; And knows as little what safe bliss commends Her private home: that Robbers haunt the road She never dreams; or that the broader way Gives Danger room more ambushes to lay. 9 The sportful Twins of heav'n now 'gan to reign, And brought a season fitting for their play; Thick did they scatter upon every Plain A flow'ry verdure, and dishevel May Round Tellus's springing face, who thus beguiles Her Winter's sadness with this Month of smiles. 10 And why, said Psyche, may not I comply With Heav'n and Earth, now both are of a mind? Yet Guilt's fore-runner doubtful Jealousy Advisèd her this wild design to blind; And by sly Stealth to snatch those joys for which Though earnest, yet still fearful was her itch. 11 She therefore plotted to slip out alone: But sage Syneidesis, her trusty maid, Hunted out every step where she had gone; And Charis, an old friend of her's, afraid What might betide the Wanderer, follow'd too, Yet in her company forbore to go. 12 Nor could her foolish craft escape the eye Of warye Phylax: never-sleeping he Discover'd with what politic vanity Her own betrayer she contriv'd to be: And all the way she went, with heavy sighs Ponder'd the dangers of her jollities. 13 As pleasure's paths she in the fields did trace, It joy'd her dreaming heart the lambs to see Skipping in harmless sport from place to place: And who would be so sad and dull, said she, To sneak at home, when thus abroad we may Behold how sweetly Innocence doth play! 14 No smiling flower could meet her as she went, But gathering it, she with a kiss would pay The courteous price of that delicious scent With which so kindly it perfum'd her way: And still cries out, How poor a place is home, Which for such free full Joys affords no room? 15 Thus loosly tripping, she was lost at last Through pathless paths, into a pleasant Grove; The gentle winds through crowds of trees made haste, And in her face a gale of odours drove: Needs would she venture, and see whether this Were not the Copy of old Paradise. 16 The courtly boughs laden with generous spice, Stoop'd to salute her as she forward went; And woo'd her to accept the sacrifice Of any fruit which might her choice content: The dangling Apples smil'd, and seem'd to say, Madam, behold we meet you half the way. 17 But all their cheeks with such thick charms were set That every one did her amazement win: When one prevail'd, his neighbor straight would get The victory, but yield it back again. About looks she, yet knows not which to choose, And in those sweets her sweeter self doth loose. 18 When on the sudden, from a neighbor tree Her ears were captiv'd, as before her eyes: For mystic chains of purest harmony Insnar'd them by inchantment's soft surprize; Whilst a wing'd Quire through their new-tunèd throats Pour'd out a deluge of their daintiest Notes. 19 Divided thus with pleasures, needs she will Seek where her fond self she may recollect: Close by she stealing spies a silver Rill, Whose gorgeous bank with golden flowers was deckt. There pitching down, once more adieu, said she, Dull home, which no such feast couldst spread for me. 20 Syneidesis, her Mistress being set, Couch'd down behind her, and fell fast asleep. Old Charis kept aloof, resolv'd to let The venturous Maid some smart experience reap Of her rash confidence, who needs would stray Like some vain child, so far from home to play. 21 She play'd indeed, and little thought that she Was playing all her happiness away: She play'd, and knew not what catastrophe Would sour the fickle sweetness of her play; But wholly yielding to the fair-fac'd Treason, Into her Sense she melted all her Reason. 22 When lo, into the Grove a monstrous Boar Loud roaring out his ugly thunder came, And brought more Terror thither, than before Appear'd Delight. Never did whiter foam Smoke on the Ocean's stormy face, than now This hideous Beast about his own did throw. 23 As are the Comets, fierce with ominous light, Such were his eyes, compos'd of fire and blood: His dismal tusks, the engines of his spight Held forth their greedy points: a hedge of dread Star'd on his back, with bristles stern and high, Whose sharpness did all wrath of thorns defy. 24 At this dire spectacle their troubled heads The trees did shake, and all their leaves did quiver: The fearfull flowers fell down upon their beds, Closing their fainting eyes: the frighted River Doubled his course, and headlong through dismay Sought from his channel how to run away. 25 Strait startled out of her unfortunate pleasure Psyche flies too upon the wings of fear; Whose steps the hungry Beast as fast did measure, And swallow'd up the way to tear down Her: His roars, though high, her shriller shreeks transcend, Which heav'n and earth and her own throat did rend. 26 Philax, her soul's most watchfull friend, was near, Flying from tree to tree still as she ran: But was by heav'n forbidden to appear, And rescue Her who needs would be undone: He wisely was forbidden, till her jolly Progress, had fully pay'd her for her folly. 27 Through thousand snarlèd thickets posting, she Darted her self, regardless of her way: No peevish bushes' claws, though busily They snatch'd and scratch'd her, could command her stay: Become all speed, she found not now that deep The Vallies were, or that the Hills were steep. 28 But long flight at the last shortning her breath, Which twixt her trembling lips lay strugling, she Crys out, dear Philax, from these jaws of death The Monster opes so wide, deliver me! Where is thy God and mine! O can, can my Almighty Lover love to see me dye! 29 Hear helpless Dread and fainting sunk her down, Unto the ready Beast an easy prey: Whose hasty tusk straight through her dainty gown Unto her softer body tore its way. When lo, a sudden spear flew through his neck And frighted on the ground return'd him back. 30 A lusty Gallant, Aphrodisius Knight, Who in that lucky instant thither came, Directed it; and strait with equal might Drew out his glittering blade; whose dreadful flame A forehand strook the dazlèd Monster dead, Whose keener edge snatch'd off his ravenous head. 31 This done, he gently takes the Virgin up; Then with a courtly kiss he gives her joy. Scarce could her hopes grow bold enough to ope Her eyes, seal'd close with desperate dismay: But when she view'd the slaughter'd Boar, and Him As sweet and fair, as that was foul and grim, 32 I see there are more Phylax's than one, Cries she: This life, dear Sir, which heretofore Was mine, your love hath now made your's alone: For helpless I had left it to that Boar, And lay'd me down to measure out my grave; Whence you to me this Resurrection gave. 33 Yet trust me Sir, a life you have not giv'n To one who can forget by whom she lives: Whether you come from Earth, or rather Heav'n, (For seldom Earth such strange salvation gives,) Let my Soul big with just thanks, learn, and see Whether her debt divine or humane be. 34 The debt you mean, was mine, reply'd the Knight You nothing owe but courteous acceptation: In Ladies' rescues who forbears to fight, Forfeits all Knighthood's noble obligation. Yet by a great and dearer bond than this Was I oblig'd your danger to repress. 35 But Madam, first be pleasèd to repose Your lost-found self: a little distance hence (For well I know this place,) a Current flows Between two flowry Banks: there will I rinse My bloody hands; there shall you sit and hear A wond'rous story, and due to your ear. 36 The place was where she wantoniz'd but now: Thither they go; and thither Phylax flies, Perching unseen upon a neighbour bough. The Gallant wash'd his hands; and she her eyes, But in her own soft tears of joy, to think How she had come from Death's to that Brook's brink. 37 The various pleasures of the Grove, no more Monopolize her wond'ring eyes; for she In Aphrodisius reads far nobler store Of love-commanding miracles: and He As much admiring his own prosp'rous art, Aforehand acts his triumph in his heart. 38 Then on the flow'ry couch by Her he sits, And ushers in his talk with cunning sighs; His cheating cheeks with lying tears he wets, Three times he strikes his breast, three times his eyes He casts up towards Heav'n, three times he smiles And sighs again, and her as oft beguiles. 39 At length, I crave, said he, your pardon till You know my case; then blame me if you can: And since my self my self to you must tell, Bate me the Laws of that which squeamish men Call modesty; my story must be high; High Truth's more modest than the humblest Lie. 40 Know Lady then, I am a Man who by My birth as deep ingag'd to fortune stand, As any he that lives, if Majesty Crown not his head, and Sceptre gild his hand. My Stock's the noblest in this Land but one, Nor bears it any Branch but Me alone. 41 This made my tender Lord and Father spare No noble cost which might his Son adorn: From learnèd Athens Tutors hirèd were Whom first the wings of Fame had hither born They Athens left, but brought with them to me From thence the truer University. 42 Thus did the public Wit of Greece become A member of our private family, And I with all the world convers'd at home; Yea in their dialects too, as fast as my Young breath I could transform: nor was it long Ere many sate upon my single Tongue. 43 For never in the long and tedious tract Of slavish Grammar was I made to plod; No tyranny of Rules my patience rackt; I serv'd no prentisehood to any Rod; But in the freedom of the Practic way Learnd to go right, ev'n when I went astray. 44 This with a Pass supplyèd me by which Without disturbance I might travel through All Learning's Provinces, and in her rich Commodities, a skilful Trader grow. Their gains be doubtful, who for all their wares Are forc'd to traffique by Interpreters. 45 A clear survey of those dark steps I took By which Philosophers have Nature trac'd: Then Mathematics were my buisy book; A thousand Lines I placèd and displac'd: To heav'n upon the Artist's Staff I went, And studied round about the Firmament. 46 Those mighty Pow'rs which so securely dwell On th'open forehead of the brittlest Glasses, Melting the boldness of the thickest Steel Whilst through the furnace of thin light it passes; With all those Optic Miracles I learn'd Which scorn by Eagles eyes to be discern'd. 47 Music's most mystic soul I hunted through All her sweet Orb, and with unwearied pains Measur'd long nights and days, in hopes to know What reason married Concording Strains. What divorc'd snarling Discords, but no knot E'r mock'd my fruitless industry like that. 48 With proud delight, and with no less success I tun'd my heart to those soul-conquring Charms Which flourish in smooth Numbers: how to dress In fierce aray War's thundering Alarms; How to belace and fringe soft Love, I knew, For all my Ink was now Castalian dew. 49 The treasures of Antiquity, lap'd up In old historic leaves I ransackèd: How Kingdoms sprung, and how they made their stop, I well observ'd; with what brave Spirits did, How they their honors managèd, and what The beams of their nobility did blot. 50 But with my Soul's delight no Study e'r Concenterd so, as that which led me through The Paradise of sacred Scripture, where All Trees of Knowledge unforbidden grow. The fond World mock'd me, as too grave and sad; But ne'r would I for fashion sake be mad. 51 My Recreations were such as few Durst make their work, so serious was my Play: Tir'd with my bookish study, fresh I flew To practise Martial Feats: thus ev'ry day In both her brave Professions I strove To follow Pallas, whom I most did love. 52 Oft have I fac'd stern War, and seen the Field With streaming Ensign's goodly terror spred; Where how much more I lov'd to die, than yield, Upon my brest good witness you may read; Ev'n these seven Wounds, whose mouths once open'd wide, In mine own blood my virtue testify'd. 53 Oft through the gloomy'st Woods alone I rode To find, some wild Antagonist, some Bear, Some Boar, some Lion, the accustom'd food Wherewith I diet this my hungry spear: You well may gather by the certain blow I gave yon Beast, I am no Learner now. 54 Thirty such barb'rous heads as that of his With noble horror trim our stately Hall: Which furniture was purchasèd by this Sole hand of mine: to glorify a Wall With tapestry feats, is womanish, say I, Give me a Suit of real Chevalry. 55 And will you think Pride speaks the word, if here I tell you Fame's Trump breath'd my History? Through Court, through City, Country, ev'ry where Reports of Aphrodisius's worth did fly: No highstrain'd Parallel was made but thus, As good, or brave, as Aphrodisius. 56 Through any rural Village did I ride? With gaping eyes and mouths the swains beset me: The Mothers, with their Children by their side, Pointed and talk'd strange things: The Pedant at me Discharg'd, part through his lips, part through his nose Some wellmeant volley of ill verse or Prose. 57 But when I movèd in the Court's high sphere; Stars of the noblest magnitude, although They twinckled at my fairer presence, ne'r Did an oblique malignant aspect throw Upon my motion: Honor seem'd in me To have forgot her own fragility. 58 So sov'reign were my Beams, that fewer eyes Paid homage to the King's, than unto Mine: Devoutly did the Ladies sacrifice Their Looks, and sighs, and Languors at my shrine; Oft has the Queen gone out alone, whilst they Forgot to follow her if I did stay. 59 How many a pretty Embassy have I Receiv'd from them, which put me to my wit How not to understand! but by and by Some Comment would come smiling after it; Which yet with modest art endeavor'd how Not to profess what most it strove to show. 60 But though thus oft and delicately haunted By these sweet fairies; still with resolute heed Some handsome way or other I invented How not to be at leisure: for indeed, I other business had which fill'd my head, Books call'd me up, and Books put me to bed. 61 This my Disease thus known, a Lady sped To me a Handful of Conceit, cloath'd in So quaint a Cover, as forc'd me to read That unwrit lesson e'r I could begin To ope the Book; and what did that contain, But A Discourse to prove all Learning vain? 62 Bold Title, then said I, if thou can'st make Thy Promise good, by Learning thou must do it. With that I threw't aside; yet could not slake My curious itch to look again into it. I look'd and read, and saw how finely Wit Had whipp'd it self; and then grew friends with it. 63 Then summon'd by Civility I went To court the Giver, and my thanks repay. Look not, said I, for polish'd complement, Whose art, sweet Madam, rather would gainsay, Than thank you for your Book: Since Learning's vain, My wisest thanks must simple be and plain. 64 Between a blush and smile, she welcome gave To her new Convert. But dear Sir, said she, I sent another Book, in which you have More of my mind than in those leaves can be! A Book, writ by a Dart shot from above, In rubric lines and characters of love. 65 Yet think not that a gift: No; 'twas the Debt Which I did to all Sweetness pay in you. How could I chuse? for had I more than that, They would be more than due: but having now But only one poor heart, your praise must be Not to disdain my helpless poverty. 66 I would not for a thousand worlds again Receive it back: with how Divine a nest, If your all-lovely bosome shall but deign To entertain it, will it there be blest! If thence you cast it, take't who will for me! I ne'r shall love what hated is by Thee. 67 Yet give me leave to ask, what Lady 'tis Thou wilt exalt to sit Queen in thy heart: Whether her face more graceful be than this, Which blusheth here in pleading its own part: Whether her Lineage or Estate afford More arguments then mine to win my Lord. 68 If not; then by these loyal tears I offer At thy fair feet, this venturous Truth forgive: Thy Love is due to me. Can just Heaven suffer The best of Men should only live, to live? No; Thou an Off-spring ow'st the world, which may With Heroes furnish it another day. 69 And let it be no bar against my Bliss, That I turn Wooer, and change parts with thee: Poor I, indeed, but passive am in this, For thou although most chaste, hast ravish'd me; And all that I have said, If rightly spell'd, Will signify no more but that I yeild. 70 O may all Equity forbid, that Thou Should'st count it boldness in me to Submit: To infinite Necessity allow What Thou thy self imposest: Never let The yeilding innocent Tinder suffer blame For taking fire, when she's beset with flame. 71 As when the Pris'ner at the bar has done His tongue's last Plea; he plants his craving Eye Upon the Judge, and from his mouth alone In hopes and fears expects his destiny: So look'd the Lady, with preparèd eyes To see her joys, or weep her obsequies. 72 Full loth was I to speak, but lother by Inhuman Lingring silence to torment Her most suspended soul, and make her die Without her sentence. Many a sigh I sent Before to tell how painful was the birth Of that sad Answer, which I thus brought forth: 73 How wretched is his Bliss, whose single heart, Whilst Diverse Ladies of choice worth attend With loyal passion, He must either part, And so destroy his own; or empty send Them all away but one; and thus be fain By many a Loss to make one piteous Gain! 74 Had I as many bosoms as I owe To such sweet Creditors as Thou; with speed I all my scores wou'd pay: But first I vow, To thee, dear Lady, in whose Worth I read Such rich Attraction, that were I to choose My heav'n, for thee I would all other loose. 75 But long ago my Choice was made, and I Affiancèd: Yet to what sacred she, Is so divine a Secret, that no Key Could from my bosom pick that Mystery. My reverend Mother's tears and kisses sought, But never yet prevail'd to wooe it out. 76 Yet thy breast's cabinet I honor so, That I dare trust this Jewel there: but see Thou keep'st it safe and close, as thou wouldst do My blood and soul, things not so dear to me. And give me leave to cast this charm about, For fear thou lett'st it and my life slip out. 77 So may thy heart-strings hold thy heart, as thou This more than heart of mine: so may thy Love Be true to thee, and to thy wishes bow, As to my Secret thou shalt trusty prove: So may thine Angel hug thy soul, as in Thy faithful breast thou shalt this thing inshrine. 78 A thing which mine own Guardian Angel did Acquaint and bless me with. When through mine eyes Love first began his amorous beams to shed, And with his soft Desires my heart surprize, This wingèd friend of mine look'd through a frown, And told me, my own heart was not my own. 79 It is, said he, thy privilege, (and see Thou thank Heav'n for it,) not to run and spend Thy youth on wantonesse's mystery: Let others study how to walk, to bend, To smile, to look in print, and their spruce lip With dainty lies and softer kisses tip. 80 With Taylors for their best accomplishment Let Vanitie's gay Sons run on the score: Idolatrous Poetry let them invent, And into Sonnets change their Psalter: more Manly and generous Arts decreed are To exercise thy parts and crown thy care. 81 Court thou thy Books, and gain such treasure there As may inhance thy worth, and thee complete For a fit match for her whom Heav'ns prepare To be thy Spouse: whose face when thou shalt meet, The reading on that fair-writ Book of love For all thy studies, ample Pay will prove. 82 But dream not that the Court's all gaudy scene Will e'r present her to thy longing eye: No public glaring Gem is she, but in Abstrusest shades of virtuous modesty Delights to glimmer. Thus from common Day To private Night slip all the Stars away. 83 To yon dark Grove a pilgrim thou must go Each morn, to find thy Saint; and with thy sword Make her thine own Prey of a monster's: so Shall she salute thee with no other word But plain confession that thine is her life: Thus Heav'n contrives that thou shalt win thy wife. 84 These are my fortunes, Madam, yet unknown Ev'n by the sweetest half unto my self: And sure your hand would help to thrust me down Deservèd vengeance's profoundest gulf, Should wantoness invite me to despise A blessing higher than my Pride durst rise. 85 The former scarlet of the Lady's face This answer into piteous paleness turn'd: Her Suit's strong flame to ashes fainted was; And She although rejected, yet not scorn'd, Wander'd about her thoughts, and all agast Found her sad self in musing silence lost. 86 Yet happy she, at length she cries, whoe'r She be that must hug happiness in you. And yet permit mine eye one other tear: 'Tis not of envy; No: Dear Sir, adieu. It pitied me to see this gentle fashion Of her sincere but unsuccessful Passion. 87 We parting thus, I hasted to this Grove, Amongst whose spicey trees I knew would grow My sweeter hopes. But Heav'n it seems would prove The valour of my patience, and throw Procrastinations in my way, that I Might earn my bliss by hardy Constancy. 88 How often came I, and with bended knee On every flow'ry cushion of the Grove Implor'd the speed of my felicity! How oft to this sweet Temple has great Love Receiv'd my heart an offering all on fire, Kindled, and fed, and blown by strong Desire! 89 How often with this Brook have my poor eyes Sadly contended which should fastest flow! How often has the tempest of my sighs Outstorm'd the loudest Winds that blustred through These groaning Trees! How often has my cry Taught gentle Echo mournful sympathy! 90 At length my groans were heard; and this dear Day In that sad-welcom moment sent me hither, Which shew'd me that my long-expected joy Was now fullgrown and ready ripe to gather. Which strait had I not pluck'd, the monster had Of all its sweetness his foul booty made. 91 First then to Heav'n my fultide thanks I pay; And next to thee, my noble Guardian, who Before my hopes no forgèd bait didst lay: Each smallest circumstance agreeth so, That this the Lady is, the only she Design'd by Heav'n to crown my joys and me. 92 All blessings on thy head, my Psyche: that, That, I am certain is thy precious name. That Angel told me it, whose counsels put Me on this blest adventure, when I came To save thy life both for thy self and me, And make of thine my joint felicity. 93 I with no prying questions stand to sift Thy lineage, education, or estate: To follow not examin Heaven's, my drift; Nor must my Policy my Faith abate. O no! I am secure; all things cannot But suit aright when Heav'n do's lay the plot. 94 Here then, my heart I give thee, and I seal The Deed on thy fair lips: may curses rain Thick on my head, if ever I repeal This sacred Act, or challenge back again That Gift of mine, whose fault is only this, Of thy Desert it too unworthy is. 95 So spake the glorious Impostor; and Granting commission by a graceful kiss To his own snowy yet lust-burning hand, Sent it to treat with Psyche's, and to press With feeling eloquence that Project He Hop'd would conclude in tactile villany. 96 But as the Seaman by fierce tempests thrown Into the seeming depth of roaring Death, If he by sudden fortune back be blown Into the gentle harbor; wondereth At his strange safety, and scarce trusts his eyes, Long doubting whether yet he lives or dyes: 97 So Psyche snatch'd from Danger's desperate jaws Into the arms of this illustrious Lover; Her self into Doubt's misty mazes throws, And in suspensive thoughts a while doth hover. Deceive me not, said she, a frighted maid, Too poor, great Sir, by you to be betray'd. 98 If still I live; and all this be no Dream, (For sure your story's such a heavenly thing, That simple I alas unworthy am To be concernd in it,) be pleas'd to bring Some Proofs which my faith's dazled eye may chear, And it for your bright miracles prepare. 99 Then be the first Proof, Aprodisius cries, This diamond Ring; a glass where thou maist see The sparkling copy of thine own bright eyes: The next, this Jewel; what thou art to me Let that attest; yet pardon me that I Gave it that precious Name, now Thou art by. 100 The third, that delicate Embrace shall be For which all Loves are kindled: that which will Most solid sweet assurance seal to Thee; And my great Guardian's prophesy fulfil. Come, I can give thee leave to blush; a Maid Of what she most loves, must be most afraid. 101 Were not our case divine, I well could stay, And by our human Ceremonies marry: But We did wed above; and what can they Add to Heav'n's Rites? O no! 'tis sin to tarry. Shall Matrimony's mighty Author not Be thought sufficient to tie the Knot! 102 When God to Adam brought his Eve (as thee He did to me,) bold had her niceness been, If to pronounce her Match authentic, she Had linger'd till some Priest might intervene. Nor could my Angel, if in this I err, Forbear to tell me so. Come then my Dear. 103 Forgetful Psyche now inchanted quite By these harmonious Wiles, set ope her breast To the loose fancies of unclean Delight: Forthwith a knot of unseen serpents prest Into her heart, and set it so on fire, That strait it flamèd out with foul Desire. 104 But Phylax seeing that outrageous flame, Wakes heavy-brow'd Syneidesis, and cries, Run, run, and help to save your dying Dame; Look how her funeral flames aforehand rise. Up flies the maid, and instantly thrust in Between the Lovers and their ready sin. 105 Back Psyche flung, and from her forehead shot Mix'd darts of guilty Wrath and wild Disdain: Impudent Wretch, crys Aphrodisius, what Has made thy life so vile, that thou shouldst strain To forfeit it to me? I prithee go, Dy somewhere else: I'd be no Woman's foe. 106 O then, said she, forbear to stain my pure And spotless Mistress. Fy, cries Psyche, fy, I know her not: My Lord, can you endure I should such saucy servants own, as she? Is your Love's might less mighty than before? Tear down this Sow, as you dispatch'd the Boar. 107 He having steeping, in a box of Jett, A blacker Liquor, drawn from Lethe lake, Upon Syneidesis strait emptied it. She rubb'd her eyes; but found their strength too weak To grapple with that stupor which did creep On her dull'd brow, and down she fell asleep. 108 As when the Child, ventring his feet to prove, Carelesly stumbles to some Precipice; His tender Nurse, wing'd both with fear and love, Makes on amain, with most intentive eyes Not on her way, but Him, who now she knows Is stepping into Death's wide open jaws: 109 So watchful Charis, who did distance keep Till her Assistance might more useful be, Now snatch'd Speed's wheels; and rousing from her sleep Syneidesis, be not dismay'd, said she, But try with me, whether Heav'n's bridle will Not curb your Lady's fierce career to hell. 110 With that, as Phœbus steals his subtil Ray Through virgin Crystal, so through Psyche's breast She darts her hand, and strives to snatch away The poisonous Brood from their usurpèd Nest: Yet she flings back, and though herself forlorn, Casts on her fairest Friend foul frowning scorn. 111 Thus when the Prince's gracious Proclamation Woo's the successful Rebel from his sin: Outrageous he with sullen indignation Kicks the kind offer, and had rather in His pleasing Poison wallow, than confess That he, heav'n-favor'd he, infected is. 112 But Aphrodisius amazèd now To see a Beauty whose dawn damp'd his eyes, A Beauty which on Psyche's face did throw Unlovely blackness, and monopolize All heav'n within it self; recoilèd back, Some Counsel in his troubled brain to take. 113 Mean while, Syneidesis pour'd this loud Cry In Psyche's ear: Mistress, believe it now I am awake, and see your Misery: But ô how foul a sleep possesseth you! Whilst monstrous Dreams and Apparitions roul About your pleas'd because inchanted soul. 114 Home, home, I pray: this Grove grows thick with Charms And will bewitch you from your self, untill All help grows tardy for your rampant Harms. Home soon will cure you, and your bosom fill With better flames than these, which only be Lighted to plunge in Darkness you and me. 115 Why linger We? see, see your Lover's gone; Perhaps to fetch more poison for your heart, And double on you your Destruction. This unexpected News made Psyche start: She turn'd her head, and saw 'twas so indeed; Frighted by Charis, He away was fled. 116 Yet after him a heavy Sigh she sent, And would have more dispatch'd: but tuggèd by Syneidesis, at last she homeward went. Her feet crept homeward, but her heart did fly Back to the grove; which Charis, as she came Watching behind, met, and brought safely home. 117 But Aphrodisius could not make such haste As to out run the Angel's nimbler hand; Half this curs'd Paradise he had not past, But Phylax lighted down and bid him stand. Stand fiend, said He; thy punishment shall be Upon this scene of thine own Treachery. 118 Fair hideous Sir, how has your wretched spight Tore from your Memory that deep-writ Blow By which mine and my heavenly Brethrens Might You and your fellow-feinds to hell did throw? Did that fall bruise your heart so little, that It, and our Victory you have forgot? 119 But grant your spight (which as immortal is As your too-lasting Essence) triumphs o'r Your mightiest Pangs; grant that your stubborness Made you delight to earn still more and more Extremities of Vengance, and forget That bottomless already was your Pit. 120 Was't not enough that in your burning Home Hot blasphemies you day by day did spit At Heaven and God: but you to Earth must come And all your trains of sly Delusions set To ravish his own Spouse, for whose dear sake I here his Lieger lie the Match to make? 121 Poor harmless Psyche, how did she offend! Did she incroach on your black Realms below? Did she e'er envy Hell to any feind, Or strive to snatch Damnation from you? Sure you have injur'd Her, and Phylax too; For she's my Charge, and you shall find it so. 122 With that, He from his angry bosome drew A golden Banner, in whose stately lap His Lord's Almighty Name wide open flew, Of Hell-appalling Majesty made up: The feind no sooner Jesus there did read, But Guilt pull'd down his eyes, and fear his head. 123 For as the Lightning darts on mortal Sight Dazling confusion: so this brighter Name Flash'd in the Fury's face with killing fright. Strait Phylax hal'd him pale with dread and shame To that inchanted Tree, whose conscious shade Roof'd the green Stage where he the Lover play'd. 124 So have I seen a learing Cur drawn back Into the field where he had torn the Lambs, With guilty ears thrown flat upon his neck; With woful tayl sneaking between his hams; With grinning chaps, whose whining dialect Spake both what he had done, and did expect. 125 In vain he struggles: for the nearest bough Phylax with potent art twines round about It's own tough self, and teaches how to grow Into a Band more obstinate and stout Than his fell Pris'ner: whom forthwith he ties Fast to the Tree, and home to Psyche flies. 126 Poor Psyche; who no sooner was come home, But Charis hasts her to her Closet, where The holy furniture which trimm'd the room, Piously-sullied and worn Prayerbooks were. But she so strange an eye now casteth on them, As if her soul had never dwelt upon them. 127 Her idle Thoughts were grown so squeamish, that Such serious Acquaintance she abhorr'd: Which surer out to keep, the wilful gate Of her unhappy heart within she barr'd: Nor could wise Charis, though all ways she try'd, Slip that untoward peevish Bar aside. 128 Yet by untir'd Love's diligence, at last She in that heart found out a private door; Through which with blessèd stealth her arm she thrust, And valiantly rent from thence, before Psyche's astonish'd eyes, that viperous fry Which her snarl'd soul in unfelt bands did ty. 129 And see, said she, the Token your brave Love Hath hung about his Darling's heart, is this: What kind of favors His were like to prove, By these fine Knots of Ribands you may guess. If they thy Heavenly Suiter's gifts excell, Then love they Hellish Aprodisius still. 130 The hissing Serpents scrambled on the floor, Which, and their shamèd selves, they gnaw'd for spight. Psyche starts back afraid of what before She in her bosome hugg'd with blind delight; Till potent Charis in disdain did throw Them whence they came, home to their hell below, 131 Deeply agast, the Virgin ponder'd now The monstrous Witchery with serious thought: Horrid Amazement's torrents rushèd through The breaches of her wounded soul: about All her breast's region, with wide-streaming dread The Banners of Confusion were spread. 132 At length fall'n on her lamentable face, Her grief burst ope into this rueful cry: My shameful presence maketh any place Unworthy of thy noble company: Hence, hence, pure Charis; let me blush alone, Left fouler than those serpents which are gone. 133 And you my rev'rend Books, your leaves shut up, Where my Damnation frowns in ev'ry line. When holy Eyes draw near, then freely ope, But O, you are too fair and chast for mine: Mine, which let out my soul, and usher'd in All Hell, and, what is far more hellish, Sin. 134 They nothing else can do but blurr you now With those perpetual streams of bounden brine Which to my wilful misery I owe. O Eyes; if ever your salt tide decline, May you fail too: so dead a life live I That if you drown me not, I needs must dye. 135 Shine not on me fair Sun, though thy brave Ray With safety can the foulest dunghils kiss: I am a nastyer heap than those, and may Taint thy sweet Lustre by my filth's excess. Black Night will fear no spots; O may she roul Up in her pitch my correspondent soul! 136 What have vile I to do with noble Day Which shews Earth Heav'ns bright face? that face which I Wantonly scorn'd, and cast my love away Upon impostur'd Lust's foul Mystery. Did e'r Heart make so mad a choise as mine, To grow plain devilish rather than divine! 137 My stern Revenge sure on this Heart shall smoke: A tempest will I raise of sighs and groans To scourge that smooth-tongu'd Gale whose whispers woke That Wrack which stole on me: with ruthless stones I'l make this harder breast without appear As black as 'twas within when Hell dwelt there. 138 I with my howlings will these ears torment Which joy'd to drink the Cheater's tickling charms; These lips which lov'd his kisses, shall be spent In courting nasty Dust: these lustful arms Which hug'd his body, shall mine own chastise, Which now I hate more than I lovèd his. 139 His Jewel's sparks I'l quench and punish by A Coat of swarthy'st and of harshest hair: For his rich Ring of smoothfac'd Diamond, I By a course knotty rope will pay full dear: (And here, in wrathful scorn, her foot upon Them both she set; and thus went wailing on:) 140 O all ye Griefs which ever find your sting Deep in a guilty treach'rous bosom, hear Unhappy Psyche's Pray'rs, and hither bring Your stoutest pow'rs; my heart has room to spare For your full train: (Adieu all Loves,) I now Must only study to wooe Hate, and you. 141 Why was I born! (may Darkness choke that Day Whose light faun'd, on my cursèd birth:) or why When in the Boar's my Death his paw did lay Upon my throat, had I not leave to dye. Why did I scape that Monster, to be thrown To fouler ones, Hell's Treason, and mine own! 142 Why play'd such flaming beauties in mine eye As might allure and shew to Lust its way! Why smil'd my face with such mild majesty, As bad false Love, be bold me to betray! Why was not I deform'd, that shelter'd in Secure neglect, I might have scap'd this sin! 143 The universal World's Contempt could not Have wrong'd or wounded me so deep, nor thrown Upon my Beauties such a fatal Blott, As they upon themselves and me have drawn. I had not now been heir to heaven's just scorn If in Earth's eye my shape had been forlorn. 144 But in my Bodie's graceful features, my Proud graceless folly needs would surfet so As to persuade me, my felicity Upon a rotten carnal Stock did grow. To beastly solace thus with gay content My self did I an holocaust present. 145 O righteous Prophet of unrighteous Pleasure; Whose total sum's made up of desperate loss! How justly, when we trade away our Treasure, Requit'st thou us with rusty fretful dross! For all the Gains fond Wantonness brings in, Prove but a bank of vengeance on the sin. 146 Still still I burn; my fire but changèd is; And though my Lust be cool'd, my Guilt is hot, And belks and boils; whilst wroth Syneidesis; Blows up its more incensèd coals. O what Can help my ænigmatic sorrows, who Thus on my self my Execution do! 147 Stings, conscious stings, have made my heart their Butt, Graving outrageous Memorandums there Of those snakes' tongues which Aphrodisius shot Into my heedless breast: strange tongues, which here Were tame and mild, but being hence withdrawn Most barb'rous in their successors are grown. 148 Ay me! can Pity injure Justice so As to relieve me with a gracious glance? Durst any Cordial undertake a Woe Which helps itself to fester? What pretence Shall I devise, to seek abroad for aid, Who willingly have been at home betray'd? 149 As thus she lay lamenting on the floor, And strove to sink yet lower: Charis, who Had all this while but stepp'd behind the door, Comes clearly in, and crys, Break of thy Woe, Dear Psyche; 'tis enough, thy hearty cry Hath pierc'd already, and appeas'd the Sky. 150 The Copies of those Tears thou there hast shed Upon the ground, reflected high, and are Already in Heaven's Casket bottlèd; Thy grief now smiles above, and maketh clear God's louring face: Look up and see how Day Right friendly on thee shines, and bids thee joy. 151 With that, her blessèd News to justify, She breath'd into the wondring Virgin's breast Mysterious seeds of pure tranquillity; Pledges of reconcilèd Heav'n, a feast Of Paradise's most delicious cates, Spiritual joys, and soul-enliv'ning sweets. 152 Her squalid count'nance with such verdant pow'rs Of chearfulness, ne'r did the thirsty Ground Reform and beautify, when Summer Show'rs The deep pains of her gasping Drought had drown'd; As overjoyed Psyche, now she feels Warm in her bosom Grace's gentle Gales. 153 Gales on whose dainty wings strange Influence rides; An Influence of such speedy operation, That though all Opposition's highest tides Roar in its way, through their proud Conjuration With instant Might it flies, and ev'ry where Finds Victory attending its career. 154 Forth from her eyes, in spight of all those tears Whose deluge domineerèd there before, Sweet flames of gladness broke; her head she rears With sudden briskness, and upon the shoar Of Comfort having fix'd her foot, forgets Her shipwrack's Loss, and hasts to pay her debts. 155 To Heav'n to Charis, to Syneidesis Her wingèd thanks she speeds; but all aray'd In scarlet, from her cheeks, whose graceful Dress The beauty of her Penitence display'd. Blushes, though Blame's own Colours, are not blam'd: The greatest shame is not to be asham'd. 156 But whilst She melted into joy to see Her buried Soul rise up to life again; A sudden Damp clouds her Serenity, Alarming her with unsuspected pain: For Phylax flutters in, and, Come, said he, You to the Grove must back again with me. 157 As when the place of Robbery you name The Thief in white or red betrays his fear: So Psyche's heart gall'd with renewèd shame By that word's piercing rub, makes it appear In her appalèd looks: And, ah, said she, Com'st thou thus to revive my Misery? 158 Bid me go find some desp'rate rock from whence Down I may plunge into the deepest Main: Bid me post headlong to th'infernal Prince And cov'nant with him for eternal Pain: Nay bid me do 't: or bid me not go where My far worse Hell will meet my guilty fear. 159 I like thine anger well, crys Phylax; but The Grove is not the Grove it was this Morn: Another visage I on it have put, Both chaste and safe, and fit for thy return. No Boar, no Wooer's there: come let us go; Both Charis and thy Maid will with us too. 160 This high assurance cheer'd her tim'rous heart Long us'd to holy confidence in Him: Besides, her faithful Consorts bore their part In this encouragement. Yet did there swim About her breast, some tender trembling Doubts, Which spread like Mist upon her clearer thoughts. 161 Along they went: but coming near the Grove, Suspicious Psyche quak'd and closer clung To Phylax, who reach'd out his shield of Love, The downy shelter of his Heavenly wing; Under whose chearly shadow her he led Into the gloomy shades the Wood had spread. 162 For now those pageant beauties which of late Had there trim'd up a Temple for Delight, Were all unmask'd; and Melancholy sate Shrowding her hideous self in mid-day night. The heavy nodding Trees all languishèd. And ev'ry sleepy bough hung down its head. 163 There Aphrodisius his best teeth had try'd (And four of them lay broken on the ground) With irefull restless knawing, to divide The Withe by which he to his shame was bound Straiter than to the Tree; which yet he shook Till all its frighted Leaves their boughs forsook. 164 But at the Visiters' approach, he bit His lips and Tongue, and spit them in their face. See Psyche, Phylax crys, the Gallant's wit, Who hopes to 'scape confessing his Disgrace: But strait I'l make his Dumbness find a Tongue To speak out his imposture, and thy wrong. 165 Forthwith he from him snatch'd all He had stoll'n Of Earth's, of Air's, of Water's goodly'st store: The beauteous veil no sooner off was fall'n, But Aphrodisius appears no more: It proves an hideous fiend: and Psyche crys, Running behind the Tree, God bless mine eyes! 166 A pois'nous stink then seasing on the Air, Strait Phylax blew't down to its native hell: And chearfully confuting Psyche's fear, Be bold said he, and mark the Monster well: There wantoniz'd his curl'd Peruque, where now Two ragged Horns with rusty horror grow. 167 That forehead he so fair had plaister'd over With polish'd Flesh, hath chang'd its stolen hue; Being rough-cast with odious sores to cover The deadly juice that from his brain doth sue. Yet lo, the Boils spew on his eyelids' hairs Fit matter for so foul a Monster's tears. 168 Like to some Oven's black Arch, so hangs his Brow Over the furnace of his Eyes, wherein Delicious flames did radiantly glow, But now the Fire's as dark as his own Sin; And being fed with sulphure, doth confess What is its work, and where it kindled was. 169 A double alabaster Conduit hung Down from his forehead; where is nothing now But those two rotten Pipes, not to be wrung Least they together with their Moisture flow; That baneful Moisture, which as deeply do's Poison, as it is pois'ned by the Nose. 170 Two rows of Roses on those Lips did grow To sweeten every Word that travell'd by; But now scorch'd black as Hell's own mouth, they show What kind of breath steams from his bosom's sty. A breath like that which from the chimnie's top Speaks its own stink by what it vomits up. 171 His Cheeks, which lifted up two hills of Joy With flourishing spices crown'd; are sunk so low That like two hollow untill'd Valleys, they With nothing but pale Desolation grow. Now grizely Hair deflowres his polish'd Skin, Shewing what he to Satyrs is of kin. 172 His slender Hands are swell'd to monstrous Paws, Whose Nails much longer than their fingers are. Sure his Imbrace is dainty when he throws Those chains about his Love! but see'st thou there What at the portly Gallant's back doth trail? His courtly Sword's turn'd to a dangling Tail. 173 The martial Vigor which both spred and knit His manly limbs, is withered into Diseasèd Craziness; his Joints forget Their sturdy office, and his Sinnews no Tokens of their late active selves express: Witness his crinkling hams and trembling knees. 174 Behold his goodly feet, where one great cleft Devides two toes pointed with iron claws. The rest of his fine body must be left Close sealèd up by Modesty's chaste Laws. Yet may'st thou safely view his Bosom's cell And see what Jewels in that casket dwell. 175 This said; his strangely-potent Wand's petard He smartly to the Monster's breast apply'd: Forthwith the bones which had so strongly barr'd The guilty passage up, flew all aside. This foulest Book now fairly open'd, on The Angel thus did in his Lecture run: 176 Mark where ten thousand Charms and Kisses lie And Complements of every garb and kind; With which on heedless Virgins he doth flie, And whom he softliest toucheth, surest bind. Look where upon the top those Courtships be Which bravely wooèd and inchanted Thee. 177 In that sly corner, (and observe it well,) Sneak various Shapes, which allway changing be; Shapes trim and smooth and fair without, but full Of inward Venom: which industrious He Subtly improves to comely Treacheries, Handsom Impostures, and welfavor'd Lies. 178 See'st thou not there the model of the Beast, That hideous Witchery which chafèd Thee; With all the amorous story sprucely drest To court and cheat thy credulous chastity? Never did Cozenage with more lovely art, Or face more honest, act a fouler part. 179 But yet there's something stranger lurks behind: Spy'st thou that Scroll? It is a full Commission By which he made this voyage, ready sign'd, And strength'ned by the broad Seal of Perdition. Come, I'l untwine the knot of snakes which tye It up, and fain would hide it from thine eye. 180 Lo here a scheme of such confounding Letters And scrambling Lines, as never Conjurer writ: His forks, hooks, prongs, racks, gibbets, grid-irons, fetters, And all the wild Tools of his spightful Wit Are Belzebub's made Alphabet: but hear How well I ken his mystic Character. 181 Satan the great, God of Hell, Earth, and Air; Of Men and Angels everlasting foe; Rival of Heav'n, and of Heav'n's only Heir; Monarch of Pride, Rage, Blasphemy and Woe; Out of our princely grace, to our right vicious And trusty friend and Cousin Aphrodisius. 182 To thee by these our Letters-Patents, we Give full authority the Soul to seize Of hated Psyche; by what treachery Shall best thy cunning and thy malice please; That here her Guilt may fry in that degree Of Pangs which our just vengeance shall decree. 183 And see thy diligence as great appear As are thy Helps; for hereby over all The Forces in our Realms of Earth and Air We constitute thee Captain General. Giv'n at our flaming Court of Desperation, This sixt age of our Soverain Damnation. 184 Thus having read these cursèd Lines; again He crow'ds the Scroll into the Furie's breast; And, Home, says he, and ask your Soverain A larger Patent: see you are releast. But here I hang the withe, that ever you Return this way, this Token please to know. 185 Th'unfetter'd feind heaving an hidious sigh, And tearing his fell locks with helpless wrath, Flung down his Patent, and away did fly. The Grove smoak'd as he went; in all his path What Trees he met, he rent, and burnt in pain Till in Hell's flames he plungèd was again. 186 This Spectacle so melted Psyche's heart That flowing forth in holy Shame and Joy, Fresh Thanks and Blushes to her Friend's desert Most earnestly she pays: O never may My God remember me, said she, if I Forget your blessèd Love's dear Constancy. 187 Farewel false Beauties; Heav'n above, I'm sure Is full as fair within as 'tis without: No Aphrodisius there; but all as pure As virgin Crystal, or your spotless Thought Dear Phylax, which from thence its pattern takes, And a new Heav'n in your sweet bosom makes. 188 There will I fix my heart: there dwells my Love, My Life my Lord, much purer then his palace; Whose Paradise shall be the only Grove To which my Soul shall pant for genuine solace. Forbid it Jesu, any thing below Be Master of this breast, whose Lord art Thou. 189 Most, most deserving Thou; who to intice My undeserving Soul, beset'st her ways With such rich Baits as far transcend the price Of all this vain World's most illustrious Toys: Safe Baits, which hide no hooks, or none but such As into Liberty their Pris'ners catch. 190 Thus sweetly breathing out her ardent Passion, She with her heav'nly Consorts homeward goes; Yet by the way renews at every station Her cordial Thanks and her pathetick Vows. At length got home, she to her Closet hasts, Where all her Soul at her Love's feet she casts. 191 What prayers were there, what thanks, what sighs, what tears, What zeal, what languishment, what ecstasies, What confidence, what shame, what hopes, what fears, What pains, what joys, what thoughts, what words! She dies And yet she lives, and yet she dies again And would for ever live so to be slain. 192 So to be slain; for every Death she dies Higher and higher lifts her into life. Her Weakness is strong Love; in which she tries The utmost of her power, and by that strife Of humble boldness wrestles to obtain Her will of Him who on Heav'n's Throne doth reign. 193 But fainting Nature (for 'twas midnight now, And hard sh'had wrought and travell'd far that day,) Permitted sleep to grow upon her brow; And tho' unwilling, down at last she lay. Sweet was her Rest; but sweeter far that Dream Which now about her wond'ring soul did swim. 194 Imagination's chariot convoy'd her Into a garden where more Beauties smil'd Than Aphrodisius's Grove's false face did wear, And gentler Gales the air with odours fill'd: Lilies on every bed such sheets did spread As scorn'd the whitest cap of Taurus's head. 195 The goodly Walks politely pavèd were With Alabaster, whose unspotted face Lay'd fairly ope unto the silver sphere Which roll'd above, a comely Looking-glass: Whether upward She, or downward turn'd her eye, Still she beheld the same heav'n's majesty. 196 Their heads no trees presumèd there to shew Which e'r had been deflour'd by Winter's blast: Plants of eternal verdure only grew Upon that virgin soil; such trees as cast Both cool and constant shades; and having been Planted of old, still livèd young and green. 197 No fountain bubled there, but fed with springs Of purest milk; upon whose dainty shoar Chaste-sighing Turtles sate, and wash'd their wings, Though full as white and pure as it before. But thus one Candor pour'd upon another Do's kindly kiss and sport it with his brother. 198 A princely Castle in the mid'st commands, Invincible for strength and for delight; Fram'd all of massy crystal, and by hands As pure as those Materials were bright. A clearer Court was ne'r by Poet's brain Built for Queen Thetis in her watery Main. 199 Ten thousand Blushes stood before the Gate, With Magnanimities all hand in hand: As many Purities in modest state Were rangèd with as many Beauties, and Young smiling Graces; whose sweet task it was To be the Guard of that dilicious Place. 200 As Psyche wonder'd at th'illustrious sight, Her constant Phylax met her puzl'd eye: Strait she demands, What Place was that, so bright With more than earthly pomp! for Chastity 'Twas built, said He, and built by Him who is The Soverain of all vertuous Clarities. 201 Behold, the Gate is opening now, and all Th'officious Guard gives way: here shalt thou see (For this is Chastitie's high festival,) A strange Procession's solemnity; And witness be what splendid Princes are The stars which move about this limpid sphere. 202 There comes the first: Observe his royal gate, Majestic yet not proud: about his brows A glittering Coronet wreaths his princely state, And in his hand a Palm his triumph shows; Full flows his Robe, and following his steps, Them with a train imperial fairly sweeps. 203 Less white this Pavement is, less sweet are those Perfumèd Lilies, than that Robe of his. From his own Fleece Heav'n's Lamb was pleas'd to choose The richest snowiest Wool, to cloth and dress His spotless friends and fellow-lambs, who are All privileg'd this Livery to wear. 204 Those graceful Eyes, in which Love's Throne is set, Are they which did Potiphera defy: What need I that fresh History repeat? This is that Joseph, tho' advancèd high In Pharaoh's realm, yet now more glorious grown, Holding a fairer Kingdom of his own. 205 The next's a Female, in the same array; For Sexes here no outward difference show, But all like Angels live, since noble They Strove to forget their He and She below And, tho' clogg'd with gross Earth, yet overtake That spotlesness which us doth equal make. 206 Susanna is her Name, and gloriously Her Virtue made it good: What Lily e'r Could clearer fairer proofs produce that She Did in her native whiteness persevere? Ev'n Life could not, altho' its price be high Hire her to give her Lily-name the ly. 207 The goodly Orb of that her radiant face, Which none but chaste and holy beams did shed, Two lustful Elders made their daily Glass, And with the Antidote invenomèd Their shameless Hearts. So bold is Lust, that she Dares hope to find a Blot in Purity. 208 When Cancer scorch'd the World, and tender She Went in her private Garden's shaded Spring, (As in the Emblem of her Chastity) To cool her bashful self; They issuing Out of their ambush, in their cloaths express More shame, than Her discover'd Nakedness: 209 We too, are hot, cry they; but none but Thou Canst quench the fury of our mighty flames: Thou art the Fount in which all Pleasures flow, And we are come to bath us in thy streams. Yield, as thou lov'st thy life; else We will swear That in Adultery we caught Thee here. 210 Nay swear we will: nor must thy Vows and Tears E'r hope to make the Truth as naked be As Thou art now: such Reverence guards our years, That in our lies no Eye dares falshood see. Fond squeamish Soul, what profit is't to Thee To lose thy Life, and keep thy Chastity? 211 Then welcome Death; thy gastly face, said She, Is fairer than the Visage of this sin. Here she cry'd out aloud; and instantly Her startled Handmaids all rush'd shrieking in: Whom both the fulmouth'd Elders hastenèd To catch th'Adulterer, who, said they, was fled. 212 Then haling Her unto the Bar, their own Guilt upon her they throw, and she must dy: But strait a Miracle crowds in to crown The truth of her unconquer'd Chastity. This turn'd the Sentence on her slanderous Foes: They to be ston'd, and She to triumph goes. 213 There comes the second Joseph, but as far Before in honor as in time behind: In Virtue's shop as skill'd a Carpenter As in his own; whose Art a way could find To frame a Life (and raise the building high,) Both of Heroic Worth, and Poverty. 214 Mine and my Brethren's Office (tho' it be Both sweet and glorious,) down must stoop to His: His, who was Guardian of Divinity, And of the Mother of all Sweetnesses. And yet no Angel envy'd Him his place, Who ever look'd upon his wonderous face. 215 What Gravity dwells there, and what Delight, What Tenderness, and what Austerity! How high and humble are his Looks, how bright And gently-meek his Eyes! how sweetly He Seems here in glorie's Heav'n not to forget That Cloud which upon him in Earth did sit! 216 But look, and see thou start not at the sight, Those Beams, tho' more than sun-like, lovely be; Now dawns of Heav'n and Earth the choice Delight. The Queen of Softness and of Purity: Millions of Loves come tripping in her way, Flown from her Eye in a forerunning Ray. 217 Behold her face, and read all Paradise, And more, in Flesh and Blood: in vain we seek By Flora's Jewels to emblematize The Gallantry of Her illustrious cheek, At whose sweet composition every Grace Ran crowding in, for fear to lose its place. 218 All Cherubs and all Seraphs have I seen In their high Beauties on Heav'n's Holydays; But still the gracious splendor of this Queen Sweetly outglitters their best tire of Rays: For all her wondrous Glories' Texture is A Web of Sweetness fring'd with Joy and Bliss. 219 How rude and course-spun those Idea's were Which sprucest Pagan-Wits did ever frame, When Beautie's Idol they desir'd to rear In amorous fancies' temple! What broad shame And studied scorn would their best Pens have thrown Upon that Venus, if they This had known! 220 This Mother of divinest Love, as pure As is that other putid! Noblest Tongues When they triumphant are, and would be sure With double Heav'n to swell and bless their Songs; First chant the Son, and then the Mother; He Begins, and She makes up the Harmony. 221 Her Crown imperial scorneth to be deckt With oriental Diamonds, being set With purer Sons of Light, whilst most select Virtues (because her own) embellish it. Yet those but poorly-glimmering Copies be Of her rich heart's original Treasury. 222 I need not tell thee Mary is her Name; Her potent influence me prevented has: This cold dead Pavement lively doth proclaim What Feet with newborn lilies trimm'd its face: Whose but the Virgin-Mother's steps could bless A soil so barren with such fertileness? 223 Turn, Psyche, and behold who cometh there: The King, the King of royal Chastity. She look'd; but look'd not long: For upon her Weak face such mighty beams from His did fly, That starting at th'intolerable stroke, She rubb'd her dazlèd eyes, and so awoke. CANTO III. The Girdle, or Love-Token. The ARGUMENT. Her Spouse, in token of his royal Love A Girdle unto Psyche sends; wherein The accurate Works historic Beauty strove The radiant Materials to outshine. Phylax the rich Embroidery expounds, And with the Token then the Maid surrounds. 1 Short Taste of Pleasures, how dost thou torment A liquorish Soul, when once inflam'd by thee! Desire's sweet-cruel edge might soon relent, Didst thou not whet it to that keen degree, That nothing but complete fruition will The longing of its wakened stomach fill. 2 The Seaman, who hath with unwearied pain Wrought through a thousand storms, and gain'd the sight Of his sweet Home; that some cross wind again Robs him of that dear-purchasèd delight, He finds a greater storm in's breast arise Pouring his sorrows through his mockèd eyes. 3 The pinèd Man, on whom a thinner She, Insatiable Famin, long hath fed; Covets no Heav'n or Paradise to see But what lies moulded up in any Bread. One glimpse of this, bids Hope return, and light Life in those eyes which were bequeath'd to Night. 4 But if that cheerful Morn o'rclouded be, And his young Comforts in their cradle slain; The fugitive Blessing feeds his misery, And by rebound exalts it to a strain Of higher Anguish: now his fancy more Do's gnaw him, than his Hunger did before. 5 So Psyche famishèd with strong desire To view her Spouse, no sooner 'gan to taste Of his first Lustre, but that dainty fire Made her all-ravish'd Heart Joy's Holocaust: All other Days she counted Night to this, Whose Dawn had broach'd such golden floods of Bliss. 6 But when immensity of Beams had cast That cloud of weakness on her mortal eye; And whilst she found it, she the Light had lost In too much Light; her longing swell'd so high, That did not sighs unload her bosom, it Had by th'impatient belking Tumor split. 7 She sighs, and thinks; and then she sighs again: Each frustrate thought which labour'd to comprise What seeing kept from sight, makes her complain Her thoughts were dazl'd, as before, her eyes. Yet still she thinks, and grieving loves to be Puzl'd in that delicious misery. 8 That Glorious she knew not what, whose glance No less attracted than repuls'd her look, Rack'd her upon Imagination's Trance Untill her over-strainèd Passion broke: Whose torrent through her lips now gushing out, This amorous Lamentation forth she brought: 9 O happy ye, stout Eagles, happy ye, Whose pure and genuine eyes are temperèd To that brave Vigor, that the Majesty Of your belovèd Sun can never shed Such bright extremities of Heav'n, but you Can drink them in as fast as they can flow: 10 You perch'd on some safe Rock can sit and see How when the East unlocks his ruby gate, From rich Aurora's bed of Roses He Sweeter than it doth rise; what Robe of state That day He deigns to guild, what Tire of light He on his temples binds there to grow bright. 11 Not one of those brisk Eyes with which by night Heav'n looks so big and glorious, but at The mighty dint ev'n of his dawning light Its conquer'd and abashèd self doth shut. 'Tis your prerogative alone to bear That Splendor's stroke which dazles every Star. 12 Into his Chariot of flaming gold You see him mount, and give his purple steeds Leave to draw out the Day: you see him roll'd Upon his diamond Wheels, whose bounty breeds That gorgeous Family of Pearls, which dwells On eastern shores in their fair Mother-shells. 13 You see him climb Heav'n's highest silver hill, And through cross Cancer make the Hours run right. There with his widest looks your own you fill, And riot in that royal feast of light; Whilst to your eyes your souls fly up and gaze On every Beauty of his high-noon face. 14 You see Him till into the steep-down West He throws his course, and in th'Atlantick Deep Washes the sweat from his fair brow and breast, And cool his smoaking steeds, and yields to sleep Among the watry Nymphs, who in his rest Waft him through by-paths back into his East. 15 The kind Day thus makes all her hours attend Your undisturbèd Joys; but fainting me With one poor minute she will not befriend That I my fairer sweeter Sun may see. Yet why blame I the Day? she's clear and fair: But you, adulterate eyes, you cloudy are. 16 Had you been constant, such had been my Bliss: But you with faithless cowardize gave in. Surely I'l be reveng'd on you for this, Till you repent your treachery in brine. Perhaps when tears have wash'd you clean, you may Suit with the pureness of my Spouse's ray. 17 These querulous sighs, by their impatient blast Drove on the cloud, and now the Rain began; Down her swoll'n cheeks drops great and numerous haste, For more and greater still came crowding on; Whilst either eye-lid sprinkled in the crow'd A living rainbow on its margin showd. 18 Strange Fire of noble Love, which thus can feed And feast on Water; which disdains to find Delight in Joy, or Rest in Pleasure's bed! Which seeks its Calm in sighs' tumultuous Wind! Which dares amidst Grief's Sea expect a shore Of Peace, and Quiet in a Tempest's roar. 19 But as this storm swell'd high, in Phylax flies, Whose yerning sweetness almost loos'd the rein To his own gentle sympathetic eyes, Seeing the flood of Psyche's: but in pain, Till she was out, He hastes to chase away Those sullen clouds which damp'd her joyous day. 20 For with his wing he wip'd her blubber'd face, And fann'd fresh comfort on her fainting mind: Quarrel not with thine eyes; thy Vision was Too visible; and they by growing blind Their duty did, said He, being clogg'd as yet With lazy dust, for sprightful sights unfit. 21 Have patience till that Dust be put to bed, And mixèd with the grave; then shall thine Eye, From its dull former self awakenèd, Open into a full capacity Of viewing Him, whose lovely Princely Look Shall be thy safe and everlasting Book. 22 Mean while, this Token He is pleas'd to send, Hoping thou'lt for his sake wear't next thy heart: No Lover e'r woo'd his adorèd Friend With richer Present; that thou ne'r maist start From his affection, with this Girdle He Contrives to bind thee to Felicity. 23 The Ground's a texture all of Turtles' down, Which dares call virgin-snow both harsh and black: For He himself deep dy'd it in his own River of Whiteness, whose meek head doth make Its nest at his throne's foot; where once when He But dip'd his hand, the fount prov'd Purity. 24 To a choice Grace to spin He put it out, That its fine thread might answer her neat hand; And then through all heav'n's Jewel-house He sought What Gems to honor with this Ground: The strand Of precious India no such Treasure shows; Above, the Ocean of true Jewels flows. 25 Ten thousand glittering things He turning o'r, Cull'd out a glorious heap: Yet if, said He, I throng my Darling with this massy store, 'Twill to a Burden swell my Courtesy: She tender is, and so my Love is too: I wish her all; but these for all shall go. 26 And those were Jaspers, Diamonds, Onyxes, Topazes, Beryls, Rubies, Amethysts; All fitly polish'd for embroideries; But brighter far than ever flam'd on Priests' Or Princes' crown: Which as He sending was To honor with the work, another Grace, 27 His Snowy Mother, waiting all that while At his right hand, melted down on her knee, And sweetly beg'd that Office: In a smile (His constant aspect towards Her and Thee.) He grants her kind request; Yet stay, and let Says He, my choice Thee with a Needle fit. 28 A Twist of Glories o'r his shoulders thrown, About his back a sportful Quiver roll'd, Of metal in this grosser world unknown, The thrice-refinèd Quintessence of Gold. Yet was the splendid House less pure and fine Than those Inhabitants it did inshrine. 29 No sooner He unlock'd the glorious Lid, But lo, a Cloud of living Joys and Smiles Which in that merry Region were bred, Breaths out itself, and all Spectators fills With vigorous Pleasures, and with fresh Desires To view that fountain whence such Bliss expires. 30 Innumerable Shafts there nestling lye And keep each other warm with mutual flames, Since all their metal's mystic Ardency; A Metal which outbraves the gaudiest beams That play about the Stars, or those which flow From Titan's eyes, when they in Highnoon glow. 31 For those top raies which dart pure Spirits of Splendor Love once selecting from his royal Crown, These Arms, said He, as solid are as slender; My Quiver shall this sole Artillery own: My Heavn's the Bow which at my Earth I bend, And that my Arrows to their Mark shall send. 32 There's no such thing, believe it Psyche, there, As leaden Bolts, steep'd in cold Scorn and Hate: Each Dart's a Son of fervor, and do's wear A rich remembrance of its Master's fate; For deep dy'd in his mighty precious Blood, It keeps the pow'r and tincture of the flood. 33 With these He wounds his best-belovèd Hearts, And by each Wound sets ope to Life its way: Life is the point of these mysterious Darts Which with clear Joy and dainty Vigor slay. They slay indeed, yet still reviving be; They nothing murder but Mortality. 34 The threads of softest flax show gross and course Compar'd with these, so delicate are they: Yet cruel Steel strikes with less boistrous force, And with less fatal certainty doth slay. Immortal Eys alone can view them, but No way they see to fence the subtile shot. 35 They quench their noble thirst wheree'r they list Sucking and quaffing in the royal veins Of our sublimest Cherub's deepest breast: All Heav'n's bright Hierarchy with joy complains Of those sweet deaths these potent Weapons give, By which in Pains of amorous Bliss they live. 36 Love choosing one of these from its bright Nest Applies it near his own all-piercing Ey, From whose acute intention there prest A Dint so searching, that immediately The yielding Dart did answer't by a new Eye of its own, and so a Needle grew. 37 Then from his golden Locks, that curled Grove Of thousand Little Loves, one single Hair He pluck'd: And this alone, said He, will prove Sufficient Thread to finish all thy fair Embroidery; 'twill stretch, and always be Longer and longer to Eternity. 38 Here take thy Tool; but let th'Invention be Thine own; for who with comelier art can fit The emblematic Gift of Chastity, Than Thou, the Mother both of Me and it! She bowing low, her thanks and duty throws Before his feet, and to her work she goes. 39 Th'officious Graces trippèd after Her With meet attendance on her lily train, Unto that Tower of living Crystal, where Thy Vision lately thee did entertain. That milky Way which down Heav'n's mountain flows Its beauteous smoothness to Her footsteps ows. 40 Oft had she trac'd and travers'd it; but ne'r With cheerlier countenance or nimbler pace: The pleasure of her Task could not forbear To shew itself both in her feet and face; So much she joy'd this Virgin-work should be Child to the Mother of Virginity. 41 The Castle Gates in a soft smile flew ope To see their Queen, and bid her welcome in. She looks about her in that curious shop Of Purities, uncertain where to 'gin: She all approves, and therefore doth demur Among so many Bests, which to prefer. 42 The lofty Roof of that illustrious Hall With Sighs and amorous Languishments was seal'd. From whence in most delicious drops did fall Down to the floor heartmelting Tears, and yield A pearly pavement, which the ground's cool kiss Into chaste Firmitude did crystallize. 43 The Twilight's tears shed in the laps of flowers Less gracefully reflect Heav'n's rising Ey, When Phoebus lets in the Diurnal Hours And trims his face upon the Morning sky; Than these reverberated that fair Look, Which from the Virgin's entring face they took. 44 Thick were the Walls impeopled with the stories Of those whom Chastity had cloth'd in White, From antient Abel's most unspotted glories, Unto the latest beams of virgin-light: That Abel who first to his Lilies tied Martyrdom's Roses, in whose bed he died. 45 But at the upper end a Table hung All of one sparkling Diamond, fair and high, Whose brighter Lines the noblest Angel's tongue Is proud to read. It was the History Of Love himself, in sculpture so divine That every Word the Table did outshine. 46 For every Word seem'd more than seemingly To live and breathe and walk and operate, And gloriously maintain affinity, With that immortal Word whose mortal state Reviv'd on this fair Stage; on which were met Both his first Bethlehem and last Olivet. 47 Long look'd she on this Pourtrait, and forgot By looking long, that she had look'd at all: Her Eyes, whose prey that Object was, did not Perceive how by their pris'ner they were stole; Nor was she well aware how with her eyes Her heart was gone, and made the Picture's prize. 48 At length she sweetly cries, O that this hand Might draw those Lines of Bliss, of Life, of Love! Till Time do's fall I'd be content to stand And practise here, so I at last might prove Artist enough to form one Copy which With more than all Heav'n would poor Earth inrich. 49 But my Almighty Lord and Son who did React his Stories on this diamond Scene, By his own finger, can be copied Only by it: Though He would make a Queen Of worthless me, yet meet He judg'd it still That in his Handmaid some defect should dwell. 50 This word strait summon'd in th'ingenuous cheek Of all the Graces, which about her prest An universal blush, to hear their meek Though highest Empress: And, may we at least Copy, said they, this Lowliness, more due To vulgar us, than unto Soverain you. 51 But turning to the next her busy eye, And reading there in glorious triumph drawn The sweet Exploits of her Virginity; She blushèd more than they, and of their own Shame made them all asham'd, to see how far It was outpurpled and outgrain'd by Her. 52 By her, who cry'd, since He is Lord supreme, What help, if He be pleas'd to have it so. If next his own He ranks his Vassal's fame, And, prints it in a Book of Diamond too. 'Tis not the Picture of what I did merit, But what His favour maketh me inherit. 53 For what was I, a Lump of sordid Clay, Who would have Lowly been, but could not be; For when I sunk my self, and lowest lay Flat in the dust of my Humility, Too high I was, and might most justly in My native Nothing's gulf have plungèd been. 54 Had I had any thing in truth mine own, I from that step might lowlily have bow'd: But seeing all is His, aforehand thrown Was I beneath descent, though truly Proud Vile Dust may be, yet properly to speak, What springs from Nothing never can be Meek. 55 Whilst in this Paradoxe's rapture she Breathes forth her Piety; the Graces by Her, strong Dispute against it, clearer see Th'illustrious Truth of her Humility. (Thus when the blushing Rose her self doth close Up in her bud, her sweetness widest flows.) 56 Then round besieging Her with bended knees, In a conspiracy of reverend love, They charge Her thus: Seek no more stories; these Of thine, the best imbroidery will prove. Degrade not what thy Son prefers, nor be Because He loves thee, thine own enemy. 57 Nay gentle Sisters, sweetly she replies, I love my self too well so proud to grow; Though other hands applaud my victories, Mine own would them deface by doing so. Were that my work, this Needle at each letter Would prick my heart, because I was no better. 58 Lo in that next, that ruby Table there, And heav'nly Pattern: well the Man I know, Both to my Lord and Me a friend most dear, When we with him were sojourners below. Pure was his Life, and pure his Office was, Clensing the way where Pureness was to pass. 59 Chaste Excellence, devout severity, Courageous Temperance, death-daring Zeal, All flourish in his blessèd History: Of both the Testaments the middle Seal And Clasp was He; and who so fit to be This Girdle's beauty, as conjunctive He? 60 Whilst on the noble Baptist thus her eyes And praises dwelt; a Grace had fill'd in haste Her lap with lilies, and the dainty prize Into a chair of Alabaster cast. The gentle Virgin smil'd at first to see't; Then down she sits and makes her Cushion sweet. 61 Her maiden Train strait gathers close about, And with a Jewel each one ready stands. To her dear Work she falls; and as she wrought, A sweet Creation followèd her hands: Upon her knee apace the Table grew And every figure to the Texture flew. 62 As active fancy in a midnight's dream With strange extemporal dexterity What Scenes, what Throngs, what Worlds she lists doth frame, Making the most divided things agree, And most united snarle; though in a scant Nook of the brain her spacious works be pent. 63 So wrought this nimble Artist, and admir'd Her self to see the Work march on so fast. Surely th'ambitious History desir'd To this new dignity amain to haste, And purchase to its single ruby beams The various Lustres of ten thousand Gems. 64 The hindmost features forward crowd; for all Would needs thrust in, and rather choose to be Justled, and press'd, and nipp'd into a small (Yet fully glorious) epitomy; Than in that little Dwelling loose their seat, Where sweet Contraction made their worth more great. 65 And now the Girdle proves a Throng, which in Each several Gem did find an Union: But eminent above the rest did shine: The lovely Master of the business, John; One-different John, who, as the Work doth rise, Lives, preaches, washes, suffers prison, dies. 66 Th'Imbroidery finish'd thus: that with more speed She might present it to her mighty Son, She gives command her Birds be harnessèd: Quick as the Word, her ready Maidens run, And from the shore of her next milky spring Five pair of her immortal Pigeons bring. 67 Her Coach was double gilt with that pure Light Whose grosser part fills Phœbus' face with glory: Not glaring, like his eyes, but Mild and White, And shining like its Owner's Virgin-story. The Reins were cloath'd in whitest silk, to hold Some 'semblance to the Hand which them controll'd. 68 The gentle Birds bow'd down their willing head Not to be yoakèd, but adornèd by The dainty harness: Joy and Triumph spread Their wings, who well knew whether they should fly. Strait nimble She into her Chariot step'd, Which glad and proud to bear Her, upward leap'd. 69 As through the whirling Orbs She faster flies, The glittering Girdle to the Stars She shows: They twinckled strait, asham'd of their faint eyes, Round all the dazl'd Zodiac which throws His spangled Cincture o'r the slippery Spheres To keep in order and gird up the Years. 70 Orion's Blush confess'd how much this sight Outvy'd the glories which about him flow: His yielding countenance fell, and to the bright Triumphant Apparition did bow; Three times he try'd, and studiously felt How to unbuckle his out-shinèd Belt. 71 But mounting to the soverain Palace, She Hastes in to her expecting Lord and lays Her face and Work upon his footstool: He Her curious pains with high approof repays; Yet, on this Ground had thine own Story grown, The Girdle would, said He, have fairer shown. 72 Then to his royal Cabinet He goes, Which Spirits of gold, and Souls of Gems inshrines; And having from that heart of Richness chose The softest Drops, He in one Jewel twines Such Rarities as my tongue cannot tell; But thy dear Soul their ravishments shall feel. 73 For to the Girdle straitly linking it, He deign'd to grace Me who stood wondring by; Take this, said He, and see how it will fit Thine and my Psyche's: But be sure to ty It on so close, that by this Token She May understand how near She is to Me. 74 The second hour's scarce entring since I took It, and my leave: and here the Present is, Come, wipe thine eyes; a purified look Is but a due debt where the sight is Bliss. This said, the Girdle's volume ope he threw, Whence a full volley of Light's weapons flew. 75 But as the rural Swain, whose courser eyes Ne'r star'd on other beauteous things than what Begay the simple fields; when first he spies His Prince's Wardrope ope, quite through is shot With wondring fear, and much doubts least it be Treason in him such royal sights to see: 76 So mortal Psyche was dismay'd at this Immortal Spectacle's first flash: When He Cries out, Error cheats and frights thee thus? This Zone's not torrid though it flaming be; Nor sent thy Spouse this Token to destroy Thine Eye's, but diet them with sparkling Joy. 77 Feed then and feast them here; whilst I in it Interpret this rich dialect to Thee Which Mary's needle hath so fairly writ, And taught dumb Colours eloquent to be. These words reliev'd the dazl'd passion Of Psyche's eyes, and Phylax thus begun: 78 See'st thou that Fabric there, which lifts so high Its glistering head, and scorns to pay the Sun Homage for any beams, since Sanctity Flames round about it, and 'twixt every stone Lies thicker than the Cement? know that this Illustrious Pile, the Jewish Temple is. 79 Forty-six years had run their race, and spent Their own upon Heav'n's lasting Orbs, before This Structure gainèd its first complement: But here a moment rais'd it, and to more Pomp than proud Herod's Treasury could dress: These Stones grew in a richer mine than His. 80 That reverend Senior whose high-miter'd Head Points out his heav'nly Office, is the Priest. Plain in his awful Countenance thou maist read What his Attire proclaims: were He undrest, He still with virtues would arraièd be, Who now clothes holy Robes with Sanctity. 81 His left hand on his sealèd mouth he lays, His right he backward to the Altar stretches; His eyes are full of talk; his gestures' phrase Without a tongue, his Mind's oration Preaches. At length that throng of People there, began To guess the Sense, and what befel the man. 82 Whilst on the Incense-altar He did place Its aromatic fuel, and supply What Heat or Sweetness there deficient was By many a fervent Vow and precious Sigh; His Cloud out-flew the fainting Incense smoak, And stoutly through Heav'n's highest stories broke. 83 Where as it roll'd, an Angel leaps upon Its odorous back, and posteth down to Earth; Hither he steers his flight; his station He by that Altar takes; and there breathes forth A sweet repayment unto Zachary Of what his Soul had panted out so high. 84 Behold, says he, thy Vows and Prayers are Come back to fill thy bosom with success: No Messenger am I of fright or fear; Trust Me, and trust thy privilegèd Bliss: Thine Heart, so fruitful in sublime Affection, Hath for thy Body earn'd an high Production. 85 Thy dear Elisa, who is join'd to Thee As near in Virtue's as in Wedlock's Tie, Shall bear a Son, in whom thine eyes shall see The fruit of both those Knots; a Son so high In Heav'n's esteem, that God thinks fit to frame His sacred Title; John must be his Name. 86 A Name of high Ingredients, God, and Grace: For ne'r was Man so grac'd by God, as He. His Life shall justify before the face Of all the World this Etymology. Needs must that Name infallible Success Assert, where God the Nomenclator is. 87 A Son of smiles and Gladness he shall prove, Making thine agèd heart young with Delight. On his birthday together Joy and Love Shall spring with Him, and take their blessèd flight To thousand Souls, where they shall sit and tell What Hopes, what Wonders in thy Infant dwell. 88 When friendliest Stars had their propitious powers Join'd in the straitest league of Love, to crown With Fortune's own blest Soul the native hours Of noblest Princes; they were never known To dart so much of kind Heav'n down to earth, As forth shall break at His auspicious Birth. 89 For in his own Creator's mighty Eye, (In which the burly bulk of all this World Less than the simplest Atom shows, which by The feeble Air in scorn about is hurl'd,) Great shall thy Son appear; Let Doubting go, Immensity resolves to make him so. 90 For whilst he nestles in the narrow Cell Of thine Elisa's womb, the Spirit of Heav'n (Much vaster than its boundless Realm) shall fill His breeding Heart: which, when it once is thriven Unto a pitch mature, shall nobly prove To Earth, how it by Heav'n alone doth move. 91 No boistrous roaring Wine, or rampant Drink Shall his sweet lip deflour: his Cup must be Fed on some virgin-fountain's crystal brink, To teach his Palate too Virginity: For in his sacred veins no fire must flow, But what Heav'n's Spirit pleaseth there to blow. 92 With which brave fire He Israel must refine; Israel, o'regrown with rust and filth: and so Chastise and cleanse the Way where his divine Redeemer means close after him to go. For nobler flames ne'r warm'd Elijah's breast, Than in thy Son's shall make their gallant nest. 93 So spake the wing'd Ambassadour, but Doubt Ran shivering through the Old man's jealous heart: Through his uncertain Eye Dismay look'd out; And his sear joints did too-too nimbly start. Thus vain fear forc'd the Priest himself to be A sacrifice to Infidelity. 94 And this Reply he sigh'd: Decayèd, I Alas want blood to paint a Blush at this Too worthy News: Can fifty Summers fly Back, and with Youth my wither'd Spirits bless! Frost in my veins, and Snow upon my Head Bid me already write, More than half dead. 95 Nor in Elisa doth less Deadness live: How then in two such Winters can there grow A Spring whose sudden Vigorousness may give New Lives to Us, and make them overflow Into a third? Sweet Angel, thy strange Word May well some Sign to cheer my faith afford. 96 Sure then thou know'st not Me, the Angel cries; Wer't thou aware that Gabriel I am, Who in the Presence-chamber of the skies Attend on God and his Almighty Lamb; From purest Verity's eternal Home Thou would'st not dare to dream that fraud could come. 97 Yet shalt thou have a Sign; and I will fast Seal't on thy faithless Tongue which askèd it. Mute shall that Tongue remain, until thou hast Seen what thou would'st not credit: Then I'l let The Pris'ner loose again, that it may sing A Benedictus to its gracious King. 98 That stiptic Word full in the Priest's face flew, And fastned mystic chains upon his Tongue. He strait rejoyc'd to feel his Censure true; And with his eyes and heart forestall'd his Song. He thinks and looks his earnest Hymn, and pays For his dumb Punishment, his silent Praise. 99 But now observe that sober Matron there, Through whose well-poisèd eyes sage Chastity Her reverend prospect takes: Lo how the dear And trusty Promise in her Womb grows high; Which by still swelling tacitly confesses The same the Muteness of her Spouse expresses. 100 Mark that most humbly-gentle Stranger come To see her pregnant Cosen: Her array Is plain and poor; her Looks still seem at home, So closely cloyster'd in their veil are they: Spectators were so much her Dread, that she Ev'n in this Girdle would not viewèd be. 101 She would not viewèd be, yet shines more bright Than all the rest, because herself she clouds. So the most pure and star-like Hypocrite Of all the Tribe of sparks, is that which shrowds Its bashfull Lustre in th'unlikely nest Of the cold flint's ignoble swarthy breast. 102 'Tis She whose Handy-work the Girdle is, And who upon herself least cost bestows; She, whose salute with ravishment did seize Elisa's heart. See how her arms she throws In wide astonishment; how fain would those Pearls which have op'd her mouth, her words disclose; 103 All Glories which our female Tribe have crown'd, Cry'd she, shrink in their conquer'd eyes, to see Those brighter Blessings which in Thee abound, Thou Miracle of Virgin-pregnancy. All Happiness dwells in thy God; and He Takes up his mansion now in chosen Thee. 104 For when thy Salutation through mine ear Shed Heav'n into my heart; the Babe which lay Listning within me, prov'd that he did hear, And ken the language too: nor would he stay To act his triumph in some larger room, But, for his dancing-house, leap'd in my womb. 105 He by thy voice well knew that WORD which was Within, and finding now his Lord so near, Thought it high time to be at work, and as He might, begin his active Office here: A true fore-runner, who doth leap unborn; Unto his Lord's strange Day, a wonderous Morn. 106 See'st thou that knot of buisy Jewels there, Whose cheerly Looks some happy News proclaim? The Infant's born, and those his Kinsfolks are, At Circumcision's Rites: but for his Name A kind Dispute makes their loves disgree; All these will have it none but Zachary. 107 His holy father's Name will sit most fair Upon the Son, say they, who now doth rise The long-expected and miraculous Heir, From whom may flow a Brood of Zacharies. The Eagle's Progeny must needs inherit As well their father's princely Name, as Spirit. 108 O no! the Mother cries, mis-call him not; His Name, before himself, conceivèd was, Surely wise Heav'n best understandeth what Title will fit its Gifts. Might I the case Resolve, my honor'd Spouse's Name alone I would prefer; but Heav'n hath chosen John. 109 So hot the kind Contention grew, that now To Zacharie's decision they run. See where He writes: that golden leaf doth show The Oracle's Decree: His Name is John. In what fair equipage those Letters stand! For Marie's finger here did guide his hand. 110 No sooner had his pen drop'd that sweet Name, But his long-frozen Tongue again was thawn: For Gabriel (though undiscernèd) came To melt the chain which he on it had thrown. The Captive, glad of this Releasment, dances, And with inspirèd Lays his Joys advances. 111 Behold his friends in that admiring Throng, Whose eys and hands Amazement lifts so high, To see at length his dead and buried Tongue Revive, and yield a vocal Progeny Of holy Praise: thus strangely answering That Birth which from his cold dry body sprung. 112 That featherèd and party-colored Thing Who to her puffing mouth a Trump doth set, And hastens hence with ready-stretchèd wing, Is noble fame; which posteth to transmit These Miracles in such a sound as may Through every ear and heart command its way. 113 Look where she's perch'd now upon yonder Hill, And on that advantageous Theatre Doth all the Quarters of Judea fill With stranger News than ever thundred there. Thus John, who came to be a Voice, doth in Fame's and his Father's Tongue, his Cry begin. 114 But there the Scene is chang'd, where Desolation Was sole Inhabitant, until that one Poor Ermite chose his tamest habitation Amidst its Wildness: That plain Thing is John. 'Tis strange how Mary taught such Gems to seem So vile a garb, as here becloudeth him. 115 That Cincture stands but for a thong of Leather, That Vestiment for a coat of Camel's Hair: The sum of all his Wardrobe was no other But what upon his simple self he bare. No Riches will I own, said noble He, But what may make me rich in Poverty. 116 I know my Dust; nor shall my flesh and Blood Flatter my heart into forgetfulness, That they are sentenc'd to become the food Of Putrifaction: and why should I dress Corruption's seeds in Beautie's livery, And be a painted Tomb before I dy? 117 I'l rob no Ermyn of his dainty skin To make mine own grow proud: No cloth of gold To me shall dangerous emulation win: I live to live; I live not to be sold: And fine enough this Clod of mine shall be In Weeds which best will suit Humility. 118 Let Scarlet's Blush the guilty Court attend, Let wanton Silk smile on the Gallant's back, Let pure and snowy-countnanc'd Linen lend Its own to those who other Whiteness lack: My Bravery must be, an Eye to please Which reads no beauty in such Joys as these. 119 Let gaudy fashion-mongers day by day Misshape themselves, and vex their giddy Brain About some upstart Cut or Garb, which they Were never yet disfigur'd with: in vain Striving to catch the fashion, which is still Like Phœbe's face, but one day at the full. 120 My fashion constant as my Nature is, Which taught me it: Nor is the Sun midway His race e'r I have travell'd through my Dress. The same East op's mine eyes, which op's the Day; And I'm as soon attir'd as wak'd, who ne'r Do any other but my Bed-cloths wear. 121 This hairy Covering is my only Bed, My shirt, my cloke, my gown, my every-thing. When over it these several Names I read, His furniture I well can spare the King, The tumult of whose store yeilds no supply So fully fit, as my Epitomy. 122 Mark now that bubling Crystal, Psyche, there; That spring's the living Cellar of the Saint: Thence do's he draw his tame and virgin beer, And makes his Blood with those cool streams acquaint: Cool streams indeed; yet such as best agree With fervent flames of noblest Piety. 123 No Kitchin he erects, to be the shop Wherein to forge his Bellie's ammunition: His Table's full as cheap as is his cup, And no less stor'd with fountains of provision; This Region doth him his Catès afford, And even his Habitation is his Board. 124 His common Diet those poor Locusts are; And when he feasts, he lifts but up his head, And strait those courteous Trees, to mend his fare, Into his Mouth sincerest honey shed. Nor turns he down that Mouth, untill it has Pay'd for its sweet feast by a sweeter Grace. 125 Here with himself he do's converse: a rare And painful thing, when Men in Presses dwell; Where whilst on those who crow'd them, still they stare, Unhappy they, alas, though too-too well Skillèd in all their Neighbors, never come To be acquainted with themselves at home. 126 The rest of his Acquaintance dwelt on high, Beyond his eye's reach, but within his heart's: For with what speed brave Lightnings downward fly, Through every stage of heav'n, this upward darts: Nor will its sprightful journey bounded be By any Rampart but Immensity. 127 At God it aims, nor ever fails to hit Its blessèd mark, whilst on strong Prayer's wings, Or Contemplation's, it steers its flight: And rank'd above with joyous Angels sings, Admires, adores, and studies to forget There is a Breast below which wanteth it. 128 How often has his fainting Body made Complaint of his injurious Piety! How often has it cry'd, I am betray'd; My life and spirits all away do fly And smile in Heav'n, whilst I below am left To live this Death, of death and life bereft. 129 He fetch'd no bold Materials from the deep Bowels of any Marble Mine, to raise A daring Fabric which might scorn the steep Torrent of headlong Time; as if his Days And years had been his own, and he might here Lord of his life for ever domineer. 130 He knew the least Blast's indignation might His brittle Dust and Ashes blow away: He knew most certain Death's uncertain Night Lurk'd in the bosom of his vital Day: He knew that any House would serve him, who Look'd for no Home so long's he dwelt Below. 131 That Cave his Palace was, both safe and strong, Because not kept by jealous Door nor Bar: Those Groves his Gardens, where he walk'd among The family of Dread, yet knew no fear: For fear's wild Realm is not the Wilderness, But that soul Breast where Guilt the dweller is. 132 Those Bears, those Boars, those Wolves, whose ireful face Strikes terror into other Mortal Eyes, With friendly Mildness upon him did gaze, As on sweet Adam in calm Paradise. They slander'd are with savageness; no spleen They bear to Man, but to Man's poison, Sin. 133 So wild, so black, and so mis-shap'd a Beast Is Sin, that other Monsters it defy As a more Monstrous thing than they, and cast About how to revenge it: But the eye And Port of Purity so reverend are, That Beasts most fearèd wait on it with fear. 134 The beams of this Angelic Life at last Broke out, and summon'd in new Admiration; For Man at length, that duller, ruder Beast, Is by these Brutes convinc'd to imitation. Behold that thronging Rout which hither flies; See how they stare, and scarce believe their Eys. 135 These Deserts nothing less than desert seem, Being crowded from themselves, and now become Jurie's thick Towns, and fair Jerusalem, Which hither have remov'd their populous Home. What now has John lost by his private Cell, To which whole Towns and Cities flock to dwell? 136 Thus generous Honor righteously disdains Ev'n to be touched by th'high-panting reach Of bold Ambition: but through hills and plains, And dens and caves, and Deserts' hunts, to catch The modest fugitive, whom Worth doth hurry From Worth's Reward, and makes afraid of Glory. 137 His Auditory now so ample grown, The noble Ermite is resolv'd to Preach: Behold, says he, that promis'd Glorie's Dawn, (Which to behold, the Patriarchs did reach Their necks and eyes through many a shady thing) In your horizon now begins to spring. 138 O fail ye not to meet his gracious Beams With undefilèd hearts; for such is He; And will Baptize you with refinèd streams Of searching fire, that you may Metal be Of pure alloy, and, signèd with his face And Motto, through his Realm for current pass. 139 Let not that Power of Spots and Blots, which in Your Souls now reigns, make you despair to be Freed from the nasty bondage of your Sin, For you aforehand shall be Wash'd by me: My water for his fire the way prepares, As for my water must your hearty Tears. 140 Observ'st thou, Psyche, how that silver stream Its limpid self doth through the Girdle wind: This Jordan is, and there the People seem At busy crowding strife who first should find A better Baptism in those floods, which may Their fruitless Legal Washings wash away. 141 But mark that grateful He: how sweet his eye, How delicate and how divine his face Embellish'd with heart-conquering Majesty! Were't thou to choose thy Spouse, wouldst thou no place Thy soul to Him? 'Tis He: O no, it is As much of Him as Jewels can express. 142 To be Baptisèd, but not cleans'd, comes He, Who is more spotless than that living Light Which gilds the crest of Heav'n's sublimity: He comes, by being washèd to wash white Baptism itself, that it henceforth from Him And his pure Touch, with Purity may swim. 143 As when amongst a gross ignoble crowd Of flints and pebbles and such earth-bred stones An heaven-descended Diamond strives to shroud Its luster's brave ejaculations; Although it 'scapes the test of vulgar eyes, The wiser Ieweller the Gem descries: 144 So most judicious John's descerning eye This Stranger's shy but noble splendor read. Besides, when others to their Baptism by A penitent Confession prefacèd, He wav'd that useless Circumstance, and so Himself conceal'd, yet intimated too. 145 See how Suspense astounds the Baptist: for The Promis'd sign his Master to descry Appearèd not: this made his just Demur Dispute the case, and resolutely cry, If thou art spotless, fitter 'tis for me Who sinful am, to be baptiz'd by thee. 146 But when his Lord reply'd, For once let me Prevail, since thus alone we must fulfil The sum of righteousness; ambiguous He Felt sacred Aw surprize his trembling Will: He mus'd, and guess'd, and hoverèd about The glimmering Truth with many a yielding thought. 147 Which Jesus seeing, He upon him threw The urgent yoak of an express Injunction; Whose virtue forthwith efficacious grew, And made the meek Saint bow to his high function. Cast but thine eye a little up the stream, Wading in Crystal there thou seest Them. 148 Old Jordan smil'd, receiving such high Pay For those small pains obedient he had spent Making his water's guard the dryèd way Through wonders when to Canaan Israel went. Nor do's he envy now Pactolus' streams Or eastern flouds, whose paths are pav'd with Gems. 149 The waves came crowding one upon another To their fair Lord their chaste salute to give: Each one did chide and justle back his brother, And with laborious foaming murmur strive To kiss those Feet, and so more spotless grow, Than from its virgin spring it first did flow. 150 But those most happy Drops the Baptist cast On Life's pure head, into the joyless Sea Which borroweth from Death its stile, made haste, And soon confuted that sad Heraldry: The Deep that day reviv'd, and clapt his hands, And roll'd his smiles about his wondring strands. 151 See there thy Spouse is on the bank, and more Than Heav'n flown down and pitch'd upon his head: That snowy Dove which perchèd heretofore High on the all-illustrious Throne of God, Hath chose this seat, nor thinks it a Descent On such high terms to leave the Firmament. 152 For wheresoever Jesus is, although In the profoundest sink of black Disgrace, Still Glory triumphs in his soveraign brow, Still Majesty holds its imperial place In the bright Orb of his all-lovely Eye; Still most depressèd He remains Most High. 153 And Heav'n well-witness'd this strange truth, which in That wondrous instant op'd its mouth and cry'd, This is my Darling Son, in whom do shine All my Joy's Jewels. O how far and wide That Voice did fly, on which each Wind gat hold, And round about the World the Wonder told. 154 From hence to Court the valiant Baptist goes, Where Lusty sins no less than Herod reign: Meek Sanctity had arm'd him well with those Proud Enemies a combat to maintain. He who dares nothing but his Maker fear, Against all Monsters may proclaim a War. 155 Behold how Pomp besots great Herod there: O what imposthumes of fond Majesty Pride puffs into his face! Durst there appear A Censor now a just Truth to apply Home to the King, and tell him that his eyes Should rather swell with Tears, his breast with Sighs? 156 Yes, there the Heav'n-embravèd Preacher is, Who therefore in strong pity melts to see A Prince made Subject to vile wickedness. Great Sir, the Match unlawful is, cries he: O far be it from Kings to break the Law, For whose defence so strong their Scepters grow. 157 Since to thine own Commands, just duty Thou Expectest from thy Subjects; let thy neck Not scorn to thine own Maker's yoke to bow. The Precedent may dangerous prove, and wrack Thy throne and kingdom, if thy People read Highest Rebellion's Lesson in their Head. 158 Thy Brother's Wife to Him as near is ty'd As He himself; O tear him not in sunder: You murder him alive when you divide His Dearest Unity: The worst of Plunder Is Mercy, if compar'd with this, which doth By tearing off one half, unravel both. 159 Live, live O King, and flourish; live for ever; Yet not for works of Death, but Acts of Life. Death's proper hateful office 'tis to sever The loving Husband from his lawful Wife: But He his wrath as yet deferrèd hath; O why wilt Thou more cruel be than Death! 160 God who made this enclosure, hedging Her In to her Philip, still hath left to Thee And thy free choice, an open Champain, where Millions of sweet and virgin Beauties be. Adorn thy bed with any one beside, Only thy Brother's must not be thy Bride. 161 Must not? th'Adulteress cry'd (for she was by) Whether is Herod, or that Youngling, King? And shall the Acts of awful Majesty Be flouted by this upstart pratling Thing? My bodkin burns his traytorous tongue to bore, And make it sure for preaching Me a Whore. 162 Be thou content my Dear, the King replies, Strait I'l revenge thy Wrong, for 'tis mine own. Rebellion's fiery Boils may likelier rise From his invenom'd Words against my Crown, Than from our spotless Match; which Heav'n long bless! Drag him to Prison, he shall smart for this. 163 (Unhappy Truth, how gains vain flattery More grace and freedom in the Court than Thou, Who mightst secure and prosper Majesty, Whilst that doth Lies, and Traps, and Poisons strew! Who though thou meek and poor and naked art, Yet bear'st a valiant and loyall heart!) 164 Deep in the City's bottom sunk there was A Goal, where Darkness dwelt and Desolation: Through all the Town's proud Taunts inforc'd to pass, In glorious patience and meek exultation: The Saint is thither hurried, and down Into the miry dungeon headlong thrown. 165 So when unworthy Chance doth prostitute Some noble Jewel unto sordid Swine, The senseless Beasts unable to compute Their Prize's worth, or read those beams which shine With love-commanding beauty, rudely tread Into the vilest dirt its precious head. 166 These rude dead walls, with stones almost as hard As that which for a heart did serve the King, The Pris'ner up in a new desart barr'd: Yet his free Contemplation still did bring Heav'n's latitude into those straits, and swell With Angels and with God that lesser Hell. 167 This is his noble Company, and He More liberty doth in his Goal enjoy, Than foolish Herod, though his Tetrarchy Op's to his loosest Lusts so wide a way. Vice is the foulest Prison, and in this Not John, but Herod the close Pris'ner is. 168 Yet Herod thinks not so: (what pity 'tis Vain Thought and Fancy thus the scale should sway, And ponderous Reason's sober solidness Like light and idle froth be cast away!) For this smart Preacher thus imprison'd, He Judges himself, and all his Pleasures free. 169 And in that freedom means to celebrate That Day which gave him welcome from the womb; To crown which Ceremony with bright state, His glittering Nobles all to Court must come, That Men might in the splendor of each Guest Read his magnificence who makes the Feast. 170 Abundant choice of every lusty Beast Was hither brought: No Bird so dear and rare, But it was fetchèd from its highest Nest To build in some quaint py or platter here. To Noah's Ark scarce came a thicker Croud For life, than to be slain there hither flow'd. 171 The Ocean too streams in to fill this brim Of more than spring-tide superfluity: Large shoals of wanton fishes here must swim In aromatic ponds of spicery; That Herod's ominous Birth-Day forth may bring A needless Death to every kind of thing. 172 Ambition was chief steward of the Feast; Both Cook and Cater liquorish Luxury; Only Lust mix'd the gallant sauce, and drest The choice inflaming Dainties of the Sea. Lo there the King is with his Nobles set, And all the crouded Table smoaks with meat. 173 Intemperance attended on the board, And crown'd with sparkling Wine each foaming Cup. The King's health first went round, which every Lord Drowning his own in it, hasts to drink up; And loudly prays, His life as full may be Of years, as they the Board of dishes see. 174 Next to the Queen their ranting homage they All in a like drink-offering sacrifice, And heap upon her second Nuptial day The garlands of their courtliest flatteries; Darting on Philip scorn's ignoble Wit, Whom as the Married Widdower they twit. 175 Then wild with proud excess, bowl after bowl Are to their female Idols pourèd down. So monstrous were those Draughts, that Bacchus' soul Had now all theirs subdu'd, and King was grown Of them and of their Prince; who belching cries, Enough of this feast; now let's feed our eys. 176 For he the young Herodias had spy'd; Whose face no sooner dawnèd in the Hall, But an inchanting meretricious Tide Of sweets and Graces overflows them all. Doubled her Looks' and Dresses' beauties be, Because her fond Spectators double see. 177 No Syren ever on the watry stage Did act so true, a false but lovely part, The gazing careless Seaman to engage In the delicious shipwrack of his heart: Nor e'r was dangerous Sea so deep and wide As in her narrow breast this Nymph did hide. 178 Behold her there: What studièd neglect Upon her shoulders pours her tresses down! How is her breast with Gems' allurements deckt, Yet wins more eys and wishes by its own; Whose speaking nakedness itself commends, And lustful Fancies to what's cover'd sends. 179 Yea ev'n her quaint Attire all thin and light With gorgeous hypocrisy doth lay More open what it would deny the sight, And whilst it stops, invites into the way. About she swims; and by a courtly Dance Her other beauties' value doth enhance. 180 All Eyes and Hearts trip after Her, as she About the Hall her graceful motions measures: No nimble Turn can in the Galiard be, But Herod's brains turn too: who by these pleasures Again seems drunk, and to his surfeit doth Give ease by vomiting his plotted Oath. 181 By heav'n and my own Majesty, he cries, This Dance, sweet Daughter, must not want reward: For never Venus traversèd the skies, With a more Soul-commanding Galiard. Let thy Demand be high; for though it be Half of my Realm, 'tis wholly due to Thee. 182 A cunning Blush in her well-tutor'd face This mighty Promise kindled: to the ground Three times she bows, and with a modest grace Minces her spruce retreat, that she might sound Her Mother's counsels, in whose joyfull ear She chirps the favor Herod offer'd her. 183 The salvage Queen, whose thirst not all the Wines At that great Feast could quench, unless they were Brew'd with the richer blood of John, inclines Her Daughter to request this boon for her. I ne'r shall think, said she, that Herod is Mine, or his Kingdom's Head, whilst John wears his. 184 Thou knowst my Wrongs, and with what pain I wear The Name of Whore his Preachment on me pinn'd: Help then my righteous vengeance on, and tear Away this Grief which knaws thy Mother's mind. This was enough: back flies the Damsel, and Thus sweetens o'r her barbarous Demand: 185 As long as Heav'n's great King, may Herod reign; And blessèd be this undeservèd Day Wherein thine Handmaid doth such favor gain, That half thy Kingdom shall not say me Nay; For real is thy royal Word: But why Should a poor Maid's ambition tow'r so high? 186 That mighty Promise well became the King, That like thy self thy Bounty might appear. But Heav'n forbid that I so vile a Thing, Thy Scepter's glories should in sunder tear, And break mine arm with Half of that Command Whose Total is too little for thy Hand. 187 A slender Gift more equal Pay will be To my Desert; Grant me but my just will Over one wretchèd Worm which knaweth thee And thy whole Stock: So shall the King fulfil His royal Word: I only crave His head Whose Tongue deflour'd your and my Mother's Bed. 188 But at this impudently-meek Request Strait, startled Herod from the Table flings; His locks and beard he tears, he beats his breast, His teeth he gnashes and his hands he wrings; He stares, he sighs, he weeps, and now seems more With sorrow drunken, than with Wine before. 189 Alas, alas, he cries, what have I done! O that my Kingdom might my Word recall! How shall I help thee now, unhappy John, Who in my Promise preach'd thy Funeral! As thee thy careless Tongue a Pris'ner made, So my rash lips have thee to death betray'd. 190 O that to day my Lords had not been here The solemn Witnesses of my great Vow! Must Death intrude, and his black Warrant bear Date, on my sadly-joyous Birthday? How Shall I unsnarle my Promise, and contrive That both my Honor and the Saint may live! 191 Both cannot live; O that poor Herod were Some private Man, that so he might be free Of his Repute! But Prince's honors are The People's too; and by Community The guiltless Body would be perjurèd, Should I my self forswear who am their Head. 192 Let my sad shipwrack steer you to the bay Of cautious safety: Ne'r let Mirth and Wine Your Tongues unbridle, and such fetters lay On your best freedom as are thrown on mine. Enslav'd am I, though King, by one wild Word, And my own Promise is my cruel Lord. 193 A Lord which forces me to bath my sword Deep in the veins of my most choice Delight: What glimpse can all my Kingdom me afford Of worthy joy, if my own Sentence fight Against my heart's best Wish; if I alone Must murder what I honor, holy John? 194 And must John die? bear witness all how loth This fatal Word falls from my forcèd lip, To recompence the too too hasty Oath Which from Imprudence, not from Me did slip. Then take his Head: Yet never say that I Issu'd this Warrant, but Necessity. 195 Thus strove the Tyrant by a comely Ly The visage of his hideous Hate to paint, Least in the Damsel's Dance his Policy Might seem to have been mask'd against the Saint. Thus dreads He his unlawful Vow to break, But fears not Lust with guiltless Blood to back. 196 'Twas plain, his finite though outrageous Vow Did prostitute but half his Realm: and why Must then the bloody Hypocrite bestow More than the whole? what Prodigality Is this, mad Herod? for John's Head alone Is worth more than thy Kingdom, or thine own. 197 Lo there the last Dish of great Herod's Feast, The Martyr's fair Head in a Charger lay'd: He smiles within, though clouds his face o'r-cast, And feeds his Soul on it, but that proud Maid Knowing her Mother by this Death would live, In triumph takes the Dish, and takes her leave. 198 The royal Beldame in suspense did wait To reap her sprightful stratagem's event: And seeing now the bloody Present, strait Grown young with salvage joy, her high Content She to her dancing Daughter signifies, In her own tripping and lascivious guise. 199 Then like a fell she-Bear, whose long-wish'd Prey Is fall'n at last into her hungry paws: She tears the sacred Lips and rends a way Unto the reverend Tongue; which out she draws, And with most peevish Wounds and scornful Jests Her womanish Revenge upon it feasts. 200 But mark that Convoy of illustrious Light Which makes from this low World such joyful haste: The better Part of John there takes its flight Unto a greater King's than Herod's feast, Being from this Earth, that Goal, his Body,—three Prisons to heav'nly Him,—at once set free. 201 The Prophets and the Patriarchs gave way, When they this greater Saint approaching saw; Who now at anchor lies in Blisse's Bay, Far from those storms he grappled with below; And sweetlier rests in Abraham's bosom, than In that adulterous King's the lustful Queen. 202 This is the Story which the Virgin-Mother Hath round about thy Girdle made to live: Yet lives it not, comparèd with this other Immortal Jewel, which thy Spouse did give To crown the rest, and tie up all the story In one divine Epitome of Glory. 203 Observe it well: but never let thy Tongue Presume that any Eloquence's Dress Can suit its beauties; which no Seraph's song With due and equal sweetness can express. The Angel here, his stately Lecture done, Expected Psyche's approbation. 204 She, 'twixt Amazement and Delight divided, Perusèd all the strange Imbroidery; But when to that last Gem her eye she guided, Excessive Joys so swell'd her soul, that she Runs over with delicious tears, and cries, Come Phylax, come, gird me with Paradise. 205 Content, said He, but then be sure to shrink Your proper self alone within your self: Severely strait's the Girdle; never think That any supernumerary Pelf Can find a room in this rich mansion, where The outward Walls of solid Jewels are. 206 This said; before her self was well aware, He nimbly buckling it about her heart, Press'd forth this shrill Complaint: O Phylax spare My squeesèd Soul, least from her self she start. Loose, loose the Buckle! if the time be come That I must die, at least afford me room. 207 Must I be girt to death, and not have space To fetch one parting sigh before I die? O me! whose sins have made my Spouse imbrace Me with imbroyder'd tortures; so that I The Riddle of unhappy Maidens, go In travel with more than a Mother's Woe. 208 And so she did indeed: Such matchless Throws And Pangs did sting her in her straitned heart; At length her Grief she bringeth forth, and shows Her wondering self the reason of her smart, Whilst from her labouring breast she breaking sees A shapeless Lump of foul Deformities. 209 Abortive Embryos, unformèd Lust, Pinfeathered Fancies, and half-shap'd Desires, Dim dawns of fondness, doubtful seeds of Rust, Glimmering embers of corruptive Fires, Scarce something, and yet more than nothing was That mystic Chaos, that dead-living Mass. 210 O how tormenting is the Parturition Of tender souls, when they unload themselves Of their blind night-conceiv'd brats of Perdition! O how the peevish and reluctant elves (Mad with their own birth,) viperously contend The worried bowels of the heart to rend! 211 This makes faint, foolish, Mortals oft prefer The sad Reversion of eternal Pain, Before this Conflict's pangs: So they may here A quiet truce with their soft sins maintain; They are content, though Hell must with their Grave Set ope its mouth, and them as sure receive. 212 O bitter pleasantness of present Ease, Which in thy bait Death's sharpest hook dost hide: The most prodigious fatal Witcheries Are harmless Joys to thee, who from the wide Expansions of eternal Bliss canst Man Seduce by rotten Joy's short flattering Span! 213 Psyche deliver'd of that monstrous Birth, Finds her strict Girdle fit and easy grown, Affording room for all the Train of Mirth With which her bosom now was overflown: She view'd the Newborn Heap, and viewing smil'd Not out of love, but hate unto the Child. 214 As one from blind Cimmeria newly come, Beyond his own ambition, into Arabia's blessèd fields, and meeting room Both for his eyes and joys; doth wondring go Through those spice-breathing paths, and thinks that he Doth now no less begin to Live than See: 215 So overjoyèd she admirèd now The glorious Day new-risen in her breast, Where carnal Clouds before would not allow A constant beam to dwell; but overcast Her soul's face with so gross a mist, that she Nor Heav'n, nor what way led to it could see. 216 Her heart clear'd up, far fairer than the face Of fresh Aurora wash'd in eastern streams: Unspotted Thoughts flock'd in to take their place In her pure bosom, which a garden seems Of Lilies planted on warm beds of Snow, Through which God's Spirit doth gales of odours blow. 217 All sublunary sweets she has forgot, Nor thinks this bitter World can breed such things. All Beauties to her eye are but one Blot: All Bees to her are nothing else but stings: All Loves are Hate: all Dalliance, Vexation: All Blandishments, but Poison in the fashion. 218 For by this Girdle she His Pris'ner is In whose alone the Name of Love she reads, Whilst in the Languishments of softest Bliss On dainty Torments her Delights she feeds; Crying with mighty sighs, O Jesu when Shall I have liv'd this Death, and Life begin! 219 What further business have I here below In this vain World, whose joys I relish not! Who is the Conqueror of my heart, but Thou? And since thy Love this victory hath got, Why must thy Captive not permitted be To wait on thy triumphant Coach and Thee? 220 Though of thy Royal Scorn I worthy be, Yet why wilt Thou thine own choice disallow? If I had still neglected been by Thee, This Body had not seem'd my Dungeon now: But why's this Tast of Heav'n unto me deign'd, If still to wretched Hell I must be chain'd? 221 To wretched Hell; for such is Earth to me; And so would Heav'n be too, wer't Thou not there. But to the gloomy Realm of Misery Shouldst Thou remove thy Throne, I ne'r should dare To any higher Paradise aspire, Than what is planted in th'infernal fire. 222 O that some courteous Turtle me would lend Her feather'd Oars, that I my soul might row Up to the Port of my Desires, and blend It with the Tide of bliss which there doth flow! I never thought that Earth so low did ly, Or that the Heav'n till now was half so high. 223 O why art Thou so lovely, if poor I Must still live Exile from thy dearest Eyes! This Token, Jesu, makes me louder cry For Thee thy self, the far more pretious Prize. O what will thy Supreme Imbraces be If this small Cincture thus have ravish'd me! 224 I ravish'd am, and from Lust's swarthy flame For ever by this blessèd Rape set free; And yet by stronger Ardor spurrèd am To be reveng'd on thy dear Love and Thee: If I may be but thy domestic slave, I of my Conqueror my Revenge shall have. 225 I yield, I yield, great Lord: Why must thy Dart Be always killing Me, yet never slay My ever-dying still-surviving Heart? Why must thy furnace with my Torment play, And burn, but not consume? O why, why must I be no Mortal who am fragile Dust? 226 O cruel Absence! ne'r was present Hell So true as thou unto its dismal Name! O torturing Hope, which only dost reveal A tempting glimpse of Light, but hid'st the flame That so the sweetly-cheated Eye may be Assur'd by that short sight, she doth not see. 227 Intolerable Joys, why smart you so? What means this barbarous Rack of sweet Desires? What makes my Tears so kindly-salvage now As not to quench, but feed and mock my Fires? Dear Girdle help! should'st heav'nly Thou be slack, Soon would my overstretchèd heart-strings crack. CANTO IV. The Rebellion. The ARGUMENT. Gall'd by severe Devotion's constant Reins, The Senses and the Passions rebels prove: Pride's voted General, who a while disdains The Office his Ambition most did love. Reason's surpris'd, and into Prison thrown: The Will revolts, and Psyche's left alone. 1 Prosperity, how false art thou unto Thy blessèd Name, who with a comly Cheat Unwary Hearts so potently dost woo, That thine unstable Bottom they forget; And think thy foot sure on a Rock doth stand, Whilst thy foundation is the faithless Sand. 2 The Day which smil'd so briskly in the Morn, And left no frown in all the face of Heav'n, E'r Ev'ning hath been made the Prey and Scorn Of sullen Clouds, so furiously driven; That Phœbus' stoutest help was all in vain, When he the gaudy sky strove to maintain. 3 The Sea in winning looks demurely dress'd, Hath often bid the Mariner been bold; When strait an unsuspected storm hath press'd Through the lamenting air, and having roll'd Into a foaming mount the vexèd Deep, In brine intombèd the presumptuous ship. 4 When all the glorious Realm of pure Delight, Illustrious Paradise, waited on the feet Of jolly Eve; she little thought that Spight And envious Treason lurkèd in those sweet Love-breathing Beds: yet there she met the fell Serpent, and found in Heav'n the worst of Hell. 5 Eternal Change wheels all the Stars about: What Patent then can seal Stability To things below? How doth proud Fortune flout The gayest Confidence which foolish We Are not afraid to build; but vainly trust Our Hopes are firm, whilst we our selves are dust! 6 Weak Dust, on which the least Wind domineers Which through this mortal Life's faint climate blows; A Life, which if not fenc'd by prudent Fears And Jelaousies, its own self overthrows: A Life so treacherous in its friendliest hue, That Saints themselves have found its falseness true. 7 So true, that did not Heav'n's authentic Law; And, what more sweetly binds, that Copy which Heav'n's humble Son on his high self did draw, The matchless worth of glorious Patience teach; Not all the Joys the World and Life can give Could charm their souls to be content to live. 8 For whilst all-ravish'd Psyche, feasts her heart With amorous sighs and pains, and day by day Riots and surfeits in delicious smart, Which relish sweeter to her Soul than they Who their too-tender studies fondly spent To cherish Her with natural Content: 9 A knot of friends with Her together born, And brought up under one soft roof of skin, Began to stomach that imagin'd Scorn, She heap'd on them; who thought their only Sin Was too much Love to Her; a Crime which might More Pardon challenge than Revenge invite. 10 'Tis true, said they, We now her Servants be: And yet as truly are her Sisters too: Nay were our native Seniority Due privilege allow'd, we all should go Before, and she, the youngling, come behind: Sure she should not have found Us so unkind. 11 But now Sh' has chanc'd the upper hand to gain, She makes Us feel it in her tyrannous Law. So upstart Princes in their furious reign Their weakness by their too much power show: So paltry Currents, when swoll'n highest, pour More rage than sober streams about the shore. 12 Our natural freedom We must not enjoy, But when she lists; and O how seldom's that! Great business she pretends both night and day, Imploy'd about nor We nor she knows what. It tickles Her, but hard on Us doth grate: She calls it Love, but all we find it Hate. 13 Yet be it what it will, what's that to Us, Who are not bound Her humors to fulfil With our own Ruin? since her carriage thus Is wild and rampant, why should we sit still With desp'rate Patience, till we be undone? What need we fear her? We are Five to One. 14 The worst that can befall us, is Destruction; And that already gapes upon us heer: But should kind Fortune's wings display Protection Over our just Adventure, we shall stere, To Safetie's Port; which way soe'r we Sail, We can but Perish, and we may Prevail. 15 As when th'imprison'd wind in Earth below, Vex'd with those straits, begins to rage and swell; Its dungeon first it shakes, then forth doth blow Its full-mouth'd indignation, and fill The world with tumult, tearing down the trees, Dismounting mountains, plowing up the seas: 16 So did their sullen murmur gather strength, Unhappy strength, by mutinous degrees, Boiling to such impatience, that at length By flat rebellion they resolve to ease Their overchargèd stomachs; being met At council to contrive the venturous feat. 17 'Twas in an upper chamber dark and close, Arch'd with thin Ivory: for their common seat A white and soft and living couch they choose, And then with fawning earnestness intreat The Master of the house, that he would please In Equitie's fair scales to weigh their case. 18 Grave He, whom vast experience had made A Judge most competent in their esteem, Smiling and nodding his assenting head, Added this needless spur to headlong them: Content, he cry'd, come let me hear your Plea: 'Tis just I to my friends should friendly be. 19 The pomp of my late Plenty I did ow To your unwearied pains, which joy'd to bring Crowds of all choice varieties which grow In heav'n, or earth, or Sea: the wealthiest King Could not outvy that furniture which you To crown my Table daily did allow. 20 But now alas, I see my tribute's thin: Some lazy sullen melancholic Things, Guilty of their vile selves, come sneaking in: But all your brisk and chearly Offerings Are intercepted; and 'tis well that you Begin, else I had been the Plaintiff now. 21 Glad were they all their reverend Censor spake In their own discontented Dialect: But strait their fond ambitions did awake A strife who first should plead: In high neglect Of all her Sisters, Opsis knit her brows, And shot Scorn's arrows from those full-bent bows. 22 Who is your Queen, but I, who sit, said she, High in the glories of my double throne, Whilst all your motions regulated be By my imperial direction: Blind fools, what could you do, were't not for Me In setting on our brave Conspiracy? 23 That proud Word from her mouth no sooner flew, But Osphresis in high scorn snuff'd it up. Coy Geusis bit her lips, which tumid grew With boiling wrath, and scarce had pow'r to stop Her tongue from railing vengeance: Acoe Prick'd up her ears, and look'd as big as she. 24 But ireful Haphe least could rule her pride: Imperious Dame, cry'd she, how durst poor thou, Who in two little tender Cells are ty'd, Such saucy scorn on all thy Sisters throw? See not those eyes of thine my Empire spread Through all the Body, ev'n from foot to head? 25 Who domineers but I, in and about Thy total self? would not this single Nail Be Arms enough to tear your Queen-ship out From both your vain thrones? Nay should I assail Thee with two wretched Motes, they would suffice To damp that day in which thou prid'st thine eyes. 26 Thus mad Rebellion's always quarrelsom Ev'n with itself. Had not their Judge made haste To stifle their Contention in the womb, Flat War had been brought forth: But in He cast His peremptory Sentence: Hold, said He, Your duty in my house, is to Agree. 27 This is the Main, how small soe'r it seems, Whither all your several winding Courses tend: Here do you pour in your concurrent streams, And in this Sea of Sense your Rivers blend. A Sea where never Tempest yet wag'd war; Far be it then that Friends its Calm should tear. 28 The wrath of your impatient Spirits I Applaud, as useful for bold Discontent: But should the Nerves of your brave fury by The frency of intestine War be rent; More with your selves than with your Foe you'l fight, And make her keep you slaves by your own might. 29 Highly I love you all, and could it be, Would wish that every One might be Supreme. 'Tis true, what noble Haphe says, and she, Most like my self, doth Universal seem: Yet is she of a courser mixture, and As well as highest, do's the lowest stand. 30 But gallant Opsis sprightful is and bright, The glass of Heav'n above, an Heav'n below: Her seat's completely highest; and the right Of her Precedency her Beams do show. She's all your Candle, and the way must lead; Ev'n your own Interest for her doth plead. 31 Condemnèd Haphe, to this sentence paid Scornful obedience; vowing not to speak At all, or speak the last. But strait array'd In joyous aspect, Opsis strove to wake Her richest sweets, and let her sisters see What cause she had to slight their poverty. 32 Yet what means joy to smile in these mine Eyes, Said she, whilst cruel Psyche domineers, And makes them worse than Blind? Could it suffice Her now and then to set abroach my Tears, I ne'r would for my Weeping mourn; but I, Alas, in Grief's sink always steeping lie. 33 The Ocean with less constancy doth throw Its tide of Salt upon th'afflicted shore, Than from my springs the stream are forc'd to flow And down my scalded cheeks their billows pour. O why must here be everlasting brine, Whilst all Tides else do know an Ebb but mine! 34 Yet were these Torrents needful to make clean Mine Eyes and Me, I would not count them dear: But what crime stains us? Is't that We drink in All Beauties round about the Hemisphere? What were we made for else? Alas that We For our Creation's end must guilty be. 35 More justly Psyche might that God impeach, Whom false and fauning she doth magnify. Is not His sacred Law our Pass, by which We travel through all Visibility? Bold Hypocrite, who her own faults doth thus Revenge upon her God by tort'ring Us. 36 Are not the Eyes those universal Glasses In which the world doth fairliest copied lie? Man for a Microcosme by favor passes, But in a blind and dusky mystery: Mine are the only faithful Mirrors, where All things in their true colors painted are. 37 Heaven's not so high, nor glares the Sun so wide, But I can force Him in these Orbs of mine From morn to ev'n to roll his vastest pride: The bashful jealous Stars which coyliest shine, Can by their busy twinckling no way spy From these of mine to snatch their wariest Eye. 38 Nay Psyche too, though her brisk mixture be Pure and spiritual, knows not how to hide Her subtile self from my discovery: She by these Windows eas'ly is descry'd, Whether she hopes or fears, or rests or moves, Whether she sighs or smiles, or hates or loves. 39 Would sullen she but deign to mark how I Am fram'd and seated, she could not despise The manifest and secret Majesty, Which doth both compass and compose mine Eyes. But she is angry, and doth plainly prove That Hate is also Blind, as well as Love. 40 Hence 'tis she pays no wonder to this Brow, The princely Arch which roofs my habitation In which as resolute Disdain doth grow As she can dart at it: This fabric's fashion Makes fair the World above, whose radiant Eye The upper Orbs have arch'd with Majesty. 41 These double Doors, whose hinges are my will, From all their sprightful motions banish Noise; Else could they not catch tender Sleep, which still Is shy and fearful, and flies every Voice. These make my East and West; my Day by these Doth rise and set as often as I please. 42 Nor do they vainly wantonize when they Suddenly twinkle; but with needful speed Sweep all th'incroachments of bold Dust away. Which on my Glasses' face had flown, and spread Their unctuous kindness gently to supply What thirsty Air steals from my open Eye. 43 Two files of Pikes at either avenue With prest attendance stand both night and day, Which free admission to all friends allow, But to injurious Guests shut up the way. Right trusty Hairs; whose faithful fear to me Breeds no dishonor, but security. 44 Full is my house of nimble servants, who Their ready selves in all my bus'ness stretch; Whither my wish, yea or my Thought doth go, With sweet activity they thither reach. No Prince's Steeds can with such speed or ease Devour their way, as I am roll'd by these. 45 Six courtly Curtains close embrace my Bed, Where I inshrinèd lie in dainty rest. The Adnate Tunicle is outmost spread, Which with protection doth the five invest, And in her bosom shroud both them and Me From hasty motion's importunity. 46 The next a Corneous Veil, both firm and bright: My natural Lanthorn, whose diaphanous side Can both transmit, and safely keep the Light By which the Body and myself I guide. No time can spend this Lamp, no boistrous storm Can puff it out, or breath it any harm. 47 The third, of Grapes' soft polish'd coat is made, Yet lin'd with roughness delicately fine; Through which all kinds and tribes of Colors trade, And traffic with the inner Crystalline: The doubtful skin of Polypus did ne'r Slide through such various Looks as sport it here. 48 This opes a casement to the Pupil, which My gaudy Iris clotheth in a dress Of perfect beauties, shaming all those rich Streaks of that heav'n above, which can express Only the semi-glories of a Bow; For mine a fair and total Circle show. 49 The fourth's that tender Membrane which doth kiss And hug the tender Pupil: when the Light Looks on the Eye with fultide court'sy, this Opes wide to meet and drink it in: when Night Her sable curtains draweth over heav'n, This shrinks the Pupil too into its ev'n. 50 The fifth of Crystal is, soft, warm, and thin, Found no where but in my rich Treasury This the pure Region is of Life, wherein Things living live again; and things which lie Dead every where beside, enlivened be, And trip about with brisk activity. 51 The sixth's a Texture of so fine a thread, That neat Arachne might the Spinster seem, Whose matchless art is so distinctly read In every line, that thence it takes its name: We call't Aranea, a Net whereby I catch the purest wingèd Beams that fly. 52 Besides, such precious Humors I contain As furnish me with richer Purity, Than do's the boundless jewel-pavèd Main Its Empress Thetis: She in all her Sea Is but of one salt-roylèd Liquor, Queen, But I of three, all limpid and serene. 53 That which do's outmost smile, is Watery, The spotless cover of a purer thing; For under it doth liquid Crystal lie, Couch'd fairly on a Bed as ravishing As its illustrious self, a molten Bed Of gentle Glass, upon the bottom spred. 54 And in the Mirror of this triple Spring All sprightful forms have ample room to play: The mystic shapes of every kind of thing Close-moulded in a soft and unseen ray On Instant's posting wings do hither fly, And dive into these Deeps of Purity. 55 Not in their glittering Crowns and Sceptres, but In Prince's Eye their Majesty doth reign: Eyes, Eyes those Champions are, whose conflict yet No Soldier's hand or heart could e'r sustain: Ev'n manly Troy prov'd a burnt sacrifice To the more flaming Might of female Eyes. 56 Love's conquering Monarch borrows from the Eye His ammunition,—quiver, bow, and darts; And wins by that soft fierce Artillery, His mighty Principality of Hearts. Eyes of his own had He, what might He not Atchieve, who has such power by others got! 57 And this is my Domestic beauties' Store: Lo now my outward equal Magazine: She beckned here; when at an unseen door With splendid haste a silver Globe roll'd in, Whose sparkling Eyes shew'd it the way to turn And wheel from Ev'n through all the Night to Morn. 58 This done: a dusky Veil she threw aside, And through a roseal East let ope the Day: Up Titan sprung, and, as the Globe did glide, Speeded into the West his golden way; Where, red and hot with his long journy, He Plummed the cool bath of th'Atlantic Sea. 59 Then bluster'd in the Winds, on whose broad back Rode laboring Clouds; of which some crumbled Snow, Some spit forth Lightnings through a thundering Crack, Some with more peaceful show'rs of Rain did flow, Some pour'd down monstrous vermin, some a flood Of not desirèd Corn, some squeez'd out Blood. 60 That Storm blown o'r; the Spring march'd forth array'd With fragrant Green, whose sweet Embroidery In blooms and buds of virgin smiles display'd A scene of living Joys, all echoed by Ten thousand Birds, which, perch'd on every Tree, Tun'd their soft pipes to Nature's harmony. 61 Yet underneath, in higher gallantry The Peacock strutted, whose enamel'd train Of the celestial Model's bravery Brandish'd her stout and gorgeous disdain; For that Boul's winking eyes could not express So full a proof of heav'n as flam'd in these. 62 Summer came next, with her own riches crown'd, A wreath of flow'rs upon her goodly head; Large sheaves of ripened gold did her surround, And all her way with wholesom Plenty spread; Where as she went, no Tree but reach'd his Arm (For it was hot) to shade her head from harm. 63 Then follow'd Autumn, with her bosom full Of every fruit which either tempts the Eye Or charms the Taste; here Wantoness might cull And weary grow: here wide-mouth'd Luxury Might her own boulimy devour with more Facility, than spend this teeming store. 64 At last came drooping Winter slowly on, For frost hung heavy on his heels; the year Languish'd in Him, and lookèd old and wan: He quak'd and shiver'd through his triple fur: Which way soe'r he works, and strives to creep, He's to the knees in Snow at every step. 65 For Snow was all things now; and in this White The wanton World, which made such jolly sport In Autumn's, Summer's, and in Spring's Delight, Must (girded up by Ice,) do penance for't: This cold, chaste, strait-lac'd garb will best repel The faults those loose hot Seasons taught to swell. 66 This graceful Pageant past: up leap'd upon The stage, a City, whose ambitious head Threatned the clouds with interruption: What Art was here to Riches married! How thick the marble Spires and Towers stood, Shading the houses with a stony Wood! 67 But like an awful Crown to all the rest The Prince's Palace mounted fair and high, Proclaimèd by its double-gilded crest Its own and its great Owner's majesty. Yet was this outward Pomp a coarse poor skin To those bright Rarities which shin'd within. 68 Here was the Jewel-house, where naked lay Such throngs of Gems as might enrich the Sea: There in the Wardrobe, in well-wrought array Their sparkling Brethren trainèd were to be: The clothing of those Clothes Embroyderers had To pride, the back of scornfull Courtship made. 69 Here stood the Checquer, that great Temple where The World's dear Idol lay in Sacred heaps: The Optic Storehouse there, hung round with rare Productions fish'd from Art's profoundest Deeps; The School of Admiration, and the Shop Of Miracles in Glasses treasur'd up. 70 Here Men, and Beasts, and Birds were all of kin, Being extracted from one common womb, The noble Proconnesian Marble Mine: And where the Statuary wanted room, The Painter's livelier Lines entic'd the sight To sport in his less cumbersom delight. 71 But in the Presence-chamber's ocean met All pompous Vanities' best Confluence: A golden Throne on silver floor was set, Which took new Lustre from the gorgeous Prince; Who in his glittering Court inspherèd was As Phœbus in the rays of his own face. 72 The Queen both of his Kingdom and his heart, Beautie's best triumph, show'd at his right hand: And Deign'd her sweet exuberance to impart Upon that Maiden Circle which did stand To wait and gaze on Her, whose goodly Look Was Wonder's fairer heav'n, and Pleasure's book. 73 When Opsis by these spectacles had drew Admiring smiles from her Spectators: I With millions more, said she, could feast your view Should I rip up my total Treasury, Which reacheth from the Loftiest pinnacle Of heav'n, down to the deepest sink of hell. 74 And these are those Oblations mine Eyes In loyal piety did day by day On Psyche's only Altar sacrifice: Yet proudly-cruel She throws them away In fierce disdain, and needs will force me to Learn a Religion which must me undo. 75 To some sad blurrèd Prayerbook she ties My cheerly Spotless sight; or forceth me To stare so long on th'unregarding skies, That with dull seeing I forget to see. She some pretence or other still will find In mere devotion to make me blind. 76 The other Sun, when he has look'd his day Can go to bed and rest himself in night: But I at Ev'n must still persist to pray, And watch her candle till the morning light. Some comfort 'twere if I might but obtain By all those Pray'rs relief for my own pain. 77 But since nor She, nor Heav'n, will pity take; What could oppressèd dying Opsis do, But let her gasping sighs have leave to break Into these just Complaints, great Sir, to you? To which may you be deaf, if Equity Pleads not as loud for me as mine own Cry. 78 She ending thus; impatient Acoe, Who thought her Sister's Speech by all too long, Step'd back into their common Treasury Kept by Anamnesis, (where lay the throng Of their ideal wealth,) and bad her make Ready her Train, whilst she its Prologue spake. 79 Hear me, said she; and be this my reward For hearing all things else: though many a sound Upon mine Ears hath most unkindly jarr'd, Yet courteous entertainment still it found: The like I crave; nor must my Sisters grudge, That next to Opsis' place, mine own I judge. 80 My House is secret; cautious winding ways And privy galleries into it lead: By which abstruse state I my glory raise Higher than if my Palace star'd abroad. Thus Jewels dwell close in the Cavity Of Mother-Pearl, and thus dwells Acoe. 81 The outward room's oblique, that violent Sounds May manners learn, and not rush in too fast; And narrow, to protect my private bounds, Which by no stealing Vermin must be past. Yet if they venture, I have lime-twiggs there To check their rashness, trusty Wax and Hair. 82 And at this Chamber's end is plac'd my Drum Made of a Parchment soft and thin and dry, And ready-corded. But the second Room Is of my active Tools the treasury: My Hammer's and my Anvil's dwelling's there, By which I forge all Sounds I please to hear. 83 By them three small but wondrous busy Bones Whene'r my Drum is beat, articulate Th'imperfect features of all breeding Tones, Just as the Teeth at pratling Lingua's gate. Indeed she only would be thought to make The shapes of Words; but Acoe too can speak. 84 For could I not, Dame Lingua's trade were vain; And all her Dialects too weak to make One Language, did not I produce again All her Productions: I to purpose speak, And I alone; Words are dead wind, till I Enliven them with perfect energy. 85 Behind these two, a third is built, whose frame So Tortuous is and dubious, and full Of Labyrinths, that thence it takes its Name. Six semi-circles there hook in and pull The sound to every corner, that it may Grow well acquainted e'r it pass away. 86 Next unto that, my most reservèd Cell Wreaths up its pliant self in privacy; Just as the wary Periwinkle Shell Hugging his own involvèd sides doth lie. From which dark closet, by a private slit To thee, grave Censor, I my News transmit. 87 Should Psyche's pride observe no more than this, Sure she might deign me some respect: yet I Want not an ample Troop of Witnesses To prove my Worth. With that she turn'd her eye, When strait her Train in decent equipage Answer'd her Look, and enter'd on the Stage. 88 Up sprung a suddain Grove, where every Tree Impeopled was with Birds of softest throats: With Boughs' Quires multiply'd, and Melody As various was, as were the Singers' Notes; Till Philomel's diviner Anthems sound Them, in a deeper Sea of Music drown'd. 89 Beneath a silver River stole, and by Its gentle murmur did all ears invite: In whose fair streams a Swan, content to dy, And at that dear price buy them fresh delight, Tun'd her long Pipe to such an height that she Sung out her soul in her own Elegy. 90 Then came two golden Orators, the one From Greece, from Rome the other, to lament Her dainty death: Demosthenes began, And rap'd the Hearers with such full content, That from the throat of the delicious Swan His, which her praises tun'd, the honor wan. 91 Yet Cicero disdaining that the Fame Of Roman Eloquence should buried be In that Bird's grave: pour'd out so vast a stream Of all encomiastic suavity, That their deceasèd Swan in every strain Of his Oration more than liv'd again. 92 But Jubal then rush'd in; and room, said he, For my prerogative, who first could teach Scholars both deaf and dumb such harmony, As overtopp'd short-winded Nature's reach. Rude things, the Hammer and the Anvil, I Tutor'd to forge soul-charming Melody. 93 Behind him flowèd in all pleasant throngs Of Music's Utensils; the Harp, the Lute, The Organ (moderator of all Songs) The Viol, Cymbal, Sackbut, Cornet, Flute, The Harpsichord, Theorbo and Bandore, The gallant Trumpet, and a thousand more. 94 Yet this great show was dumb, till in there prest A goodly Man, fram'd with Symmetrious grace; His Robe and Crown his royalty profest, And his sweet Art betray'd what Prince he was; For snatching up the Harp, he made it wake, And all its silent Brethern's language speak. 95 As to the strings he whisper'd with his finger, They all told tales, and by their matchless Noise Acknowleg'd freely, This is Israel's singer. Discover'd thus, He join'd with them his voice; And as he sung, again the heav'nly Boul Which Opsis thither brought, began to roll. 96 But He leap'd into it, and in the spheres Withdrew himself: For lo a surley Sea Comes foaming in, and proudly overbears That dainty Magazine of Harmony: The Senses griev'd to see the Tempest's Roar Devour those gentle Airs they heard before. 97 Yet worying among the waves they spy'd A wrackèd Mortal, who with greedy hand Caught up the Harp which floated by his side, And hop'd by that weak Bark to get to land; As knowing well that Music's Powers might charm Asleep the loudest wrath of any storm. 98 No sooner borrow'd He the string's soft Cry, But at the gentle Call a Dolphin came, Lending his willing back to bear him high Above the pride of that deluded stream. Arion strait with all his fingers strove To pay his fare, and quit the Fishes' love. 99 The waves grew calm and smilèd in his face; The chearly Nymphs look'd up and joy'd to hear Such courteous Accents in that churlish place, Where only Tempests us'd to beat their ear. The Winds came stealing close about him, and Catch'd every Note that droppèd from his hand. 100 The pious Fish, who all this merry while Did deeper swim in Joy than in the Sea, And by the charming Harp's discourse beguile His journey's tedious length, was sad to see The period of his Voyage now at hand, And wish'd that he might with Arion land. 101 But on the shore a Singing Troop appear'd, Where Pindar and his Lute their parts did play: All ears were ravish'd which his Numbers heard; And had not Flaccus thrown his fear away, And fir'd by envious bravery, stretch'd his skill, Lyric's sole Soveraign Pindar had been still. 102 (Yet neither of their Empires was so vast But they left Herbert too, full room to reign; Who Lyric's pure and precious Metal cast In holier moulds, and nobly durst maintain Devotion in Verse, whilst by the spheres He tunes his Lute, and plays to heav'nly ears.) 103 High on's deservèd Mountain Homer sate, And sham'd a Trumpet by his stouter Laies; Which Fame, who thither flutter'd, having got, Spread through the wondering World their only Praise: Till princely Maro with an equal Strain Embrac'd his voice, and echoed them again. 104 (These at the second bound reflected be By Tasso's Muse, but in a purer tune: The Muse which taught her sober Tuscany The Greek and Roman Poetry to prune, And rescu'd Godfrey from Oblivion's bands, As He had Salem freed from Pagan hands. 105 Not far from whom, though in lower clime Yet with a goodly Train doth Colin sweep: Though manacled in thick and peevish Rhyme, A decent pace his painful Verse doth keep: Right fairly dress'd were his welfeatur'd Queen, Did not her Mask too much her beauties screen. 106 But O how low all these bow down before Nazianzum's and the World's immortal Glory; Him, whose heav'n-firèd Soul did sweetly soar Up to the top of every stage and story Of Poetry, transforming in his way Each Muse into a true Urania. 107 And by this heart-attracting Pattern Thou My only worthy self, thy Songs didst frame: Witness those polish'd Temple Steps, which now Stand as the Ladder to thy mounting fame; And, spight of all thy Travels, make 't appear Th'art more in England than when Thou wert here. 108 More unto others, but not so to me Privy of old to all thy secret Worth: What half-lost I endure for want of Thee, The World will read in this mishapen Birth. Fair had my Psyche been, had she at first By thy judicious hand been drest and nurst.) 109 Some distance thence, in flow'ry wanton groves Luxurious Amorosos sate, who by The thrilling Key of Sports and Smiles and Loves Effeminated their quaint Melody. Nimble Theocritus and Naso were The leading Lords of all that revel'd there. 110 Whose Consort to complete, aforehand came Marino's Genius, with a voice so high, That all the World rang with Adonis' Name. Unhappy Man, and Choise! O what would thy Brave Muse have done in such a Theme as Mine, Which makes Profanness almost seem Divine! 111 But though Thou stoutly scorn'dst to be in debt To any Subject, and would'st only ow Thy Works' magnificence to thy vast Wit; Mean I, was glad my beauties' lines to draw From well-stor'd Psyche's graceful Symmetry: Thy subject Thou commend'st, my subject Me. 112 The close of all was an affected Throng Which chirp'd, pip'd, crackled, squeak'd, and buzz'd about; Mushrooms of Verse: who yet as boldly sung As Homer's self, and desperately thought Their Sonnet's crack a noise as gallant made As did the Thunder of an Iliad. 113 These vain Byblows of Poetry, begot Of Confidence and Sack, whose rhyming Itch Was their sole Jury, Acoe had not Presumèd here to venture to the touch. Had she not been aware the Censure was Not now by Reason but by Sense to pass. 114 Those various Apparitions marching by; This vocal Honey, and much more than this She cry'd, to court and solace Psyche, I Would gladly drop: but she so sullen is That what makes all Rocks move and Tempests rest, In foul disdain she in my face doth cast. 115 She talks indeed of glorious Melody, Seraphic and Cherubic Anthems: yet What faith can flame with so much Charity As to believe the holy Hypocrite; Or dream that she for heav'nly Music cares Who grates on me with none but hellish Jars? 116 In hideous sighs she smothers up my Ears, And diets me with big but hollow Groans: Liv'd I a Subject in the Realm of fears And Shrieks and raving Desperations; I would not murmur that the Monsters there Did tender me with yelling Torments tear. 117 But must proud Psyche here a Fury be In spight of all the sweetest sweets I spread Thick in her way? must her fell Tyranny Choose on no footstool but Desert to tread? Forbid it, righteous Sir, and lend some aid, Before to ruin we be all betray'd. 118 Here Osphresis the next place claim'd as due To her right fairly eminent situation: Yet stepping up into more open view, She prefac'd by her Looks to her Oration; Seeking for both, no other ornament But wrinkles of disdainful Discontent. 119 My Wrongs, said she, although I third must speak, Too well deserv'd to have been told the first. My Court you fully know; which, though it make No gaudy show indeed, yet at the worst, Dame Acoe, its structure is as fair As your however young yet wrinkled Ear. 120 For like an Alabaster Prop it bears The forhead's load, yet ows that firmness to No Basis but it self: Within appears A double Gallery, on whose walls there grow Quick watchful Hairs, which brush the entering Air To send it to my Presence clean and fair. 121 In these an useful Backdoor lurks, whereby I breath cool gales to fan and chear the Heart: But by the Mammillar Processions, I Embrace those pleasures which my Sweets impart; And then through them the Soul of Odours strain, And with pure vigorous Spirits befriend the Brain. 122 What kind of tribute I was wont to yield Coy Psyche, let Anamnesis confess: No sooner had she spoken, but a field Sprung on the smiling stage, whose youthful Dress Did all that Summer represent, and more, Which Opsis had displayèd there before. 123 Thick beds of Marjoram, of Thyme, of Myrrh, Of Violets, Primroses, Rosemary, Of Saffron, Marigolds, and Lavender, Of July-flowers, flower-gentle, Piony, Of Hysop, Balm, Sage, Roses, Pinks, and Lilies, Of Honysuckles and of Daffodillies. 124 These shelter'd were with many a spicy Tree Sweetly embracèd by the Eglantine, Who joying in their fragrant company Among their odors did his own entwine. And here the ravish'd Senses ask'd their eyes Whether this were Araby or Paradise. 125 Their eyes in wonder looking up, espied Upon a Cedar what more wondrous shew'd, A Phœnix's Tomb and Cradle, dignify'd With richer Odors than beneath were strew'd: The flames rose up to kill and to revive The Bird, which sweetly teacheth Death to live. 126 Straight th'aromatic Cloud which rollèd there Breath'd them such sprightful powers of quickning joy, That now they marvel not a Bird should dare To die a death which could such life display. And if the smoke alone, say they, can stream With such Refreshment, O what may the flame! 127 No wonder that wise Deities desire Their highest, holiest Altars should be fed With life-begetting spice; or that such fire Should cool the wrath with maketh Vengance red: No wonder Incense should have power to move To gentle Pity most incensèd Jove. 128 This ecstasy of theirs pleas'd Osphresis More than the Sweets did them: And why, cry'd she, Must I who pay such dainty Rent as this By most ingrateful Psyche tortur'd be? If she would slay me quite, there were an end; But she delights my Murder to extend. 129 For on the rack she holds me nights and days; Tying me pris'ner to a dead Man's skull! On which whilst she her hands at prayers lays Vilest Corruption's fumes my Nostrils fill. Worse is my state than theirs who buried lie In death, and smell not their grave's Misery. 130 If die we must, 'tis reason we by some Sturdy Adventure first deserve our death. Impartial Sir, what better can become Your injur'd Senses, than by generous Wrath To shew that they are Sensible no less Of their deep Wrongs, than of their Happiness. 131 Geusis, whose hasty mouth stood ready ope, Rejoyc'd to hear her sister end her speech. And now said she, my Tongue enjoy thy scope, And in thy own defence thy powers stretch. Psyche regards not what I say: but you Grave Judge will just Apoligies allow. 132 Then since 'tis prov'd the fashion to display The native beauties of our habitation; My words shall travel in this beaten way: Although my House's ample commendation By all th'admiring World asserted is, In their ambition its door to kiss. 133 For never with more reverential fear And strong devotion did the panting hearts Of zealous Saints aspire unto the dear Gate of Heavn's Bliss; than those who by the darts Of Beauty on are prick'd and fir'd to win Love's Paradise, approach to this of mine. 134 And this is of two leaves, two Roses' leaves, Whose tenderness the inward Guard supplies; A strong and double Guard, which there receives With sharp examination, and tries The burliest Guests; whom if it finds them rude, It sends into my Mill to be subdu'd. 135 There are they press'd and ground and gentle made, And so upon my ruby table set; Where, with a Canopy of Purple spread Over my head, Prince-like alone I eat; And dining with the Cream of all the feast, To my Attendants freely leave the rest. 136 They in the Kitchen meeting at the fire Sit down and pick what pieces like them best: Where each one stuffing full his own desire, Grows fat and merry; then the scraps they cast Into the sink, which by a private spout Behind the House is duly emptied out. 137 To me all Sapors willing homage pay, Knowing their credit on my Tongue depends: What I distate the whole World spits away, And what I justify, as much commends. Admirèd Honey ne'r was known to be Her sweet self, till she pleas'd and flatter'd me. 138 Nor has Anamnesis a thinner show Of Rarities, which to my realm belong, Than those my sister's pride display'd to you: Consult your eyes on that delicious Throng She ushers in: if any thing there want. Say then the world's supplies, not mine are scant. 139 Straitway a golden Table glided in, Pale as its burden, a far richer Feast; A Feast whose Powers might Vitellius win To loath his Empire's board, and here be guest. A Feast whose strange variety and store Dar'd call great Solomon's Provision poor. 140 The vanguard rankèd by a skilful hand Was fruitful Summer fairly dish'd and drest; For Plumbs, Pears, Apples, Figgs, Dates, Quinces, and Choise Apricots advanc'd before the rest: And then Grapes, Citrons, Oranges, and Cherries, Pomgranats, Almonds, Straw, Rasp, Mirtle-berries. 141 Besides, smart Flowers, and daring Herbs, to trim The wanton Board with Sallad's pageantry, And send a challenge to the stomach from Those stouter Troops which now were marching nigh: This was the second rangèd Squadron, whither All Nations of the Air seem'd flock'd together. 142 The Pheasant, Patridge, Plover, Bustard, Quail, The Woodcock, Capon, Cygnet, Chicken, Dove, The Snipe, Lark, Godwit, Turky, Peacock, Teal, With thousand wingèd Dainties, which might move The best-skill'd Luxury, the Deities Now plain and course Ambrosia to despise. 143 Next these, a large Brigade was marshallèd, For whose forlorn, first march'd the hardy Boar; And then the Bull, the Veal, the Goat, the Kid, The Sheep, Lamb, Cony, Hart, with reaking store Of every fair and wholsome thing that feeds Upon the hills, the vallies, or the meads. 144 But from the Sea and Rivers in the rear Another stately Ocean flowing came; The Smelt, the Perch, the Ruff, the Roch, the Dare, The Carp, Pike, Tench, Lump, Guernet, Herring, Bream, The Mullet, Trout, Dorce, Cod, Eel, Whiting, Mole, Plaise, Salmon, Lamprey, Sturgeon, Pilchard, Sole, 145 The Turbet, Cuttle, Flounder, Mackerel, Yea Lobsters, Oysters, and all kind of Fishes Which Lust's soft fuel treasure in their shell; Had left their troublèd Deeps to swim in dishes: Of which no Land knew such variety But when the Deluge made the Earth a Sea. 146 But all this while the sparkling Bouls were crown'd With living Nectar round about the Table: Amazement ne'r such precious Liquor found Dropping from Poet's brain; a Liquor able To make th'Egyptian Queen disdain her Cup, Though courting with a liquid Gem her lip. 147 Then for Reserves, ten Ladies' dainty hands, Th'ambitious Caters of their own delight, Had curiously raisèd antic Bands Of banquet Powers; in which the wanton might Of Confectory Art endeavor'd how To charm all Tasts to their sweet overthrow. 148 Thus having feasted her Spectator's eyes, Geusis but nods, and all was ta'n away. And is this homage to be scorn'd, she cries, Which copious I alone to Psyche pay? Must her dry Supper of the simple Lamb, Of which she prates so much, these Dainties shame? 149 These Dainties, whose soft but victorious Bait Hath many a sturdy Stoic captive led: And with whose precious-relishing Deceit The liquorish World aspireth to be fed; Tho' crude Distempers, Surfeits, Sickness, Pain, And immature Death make its dreadful Train. 150 These Dainties, which are fairer far, I trow, Than that poor green raw Apple, which could win A wiser She than Psyche is, to throw All other Bliss away: yet cursèd Sin Attended on that fatal Bit; but here On all my Board is no Forbidden Chear. 151 No; bounteous Heav'n's free Patent seals to Me Complete authority o'r all these Pleasures. And must our holy Tyrant's Piety Cancel her own God's Act; and square the measures Of my Enjoyments by what her fond Sense Is pleas'd to judge Religious Abstinence? 152 Must I be fed with Hope? or, what is more Jejune than that, vile Roots and coarse dry Bread? Must I be ravish'd from my sparkling store Of virgin Wines, and forc'd to drink the dead Deflowr'd cold water, or that Brine which she Boils in her eyes to scald my Mouth and Me? 153 Must I neglect my woful Bellie's Cry, And basely to self-murder yield; whilst She Delights her peevish self to mortify Without the least remorse of killing Me? Still must I sit till my lank skin become A mere white sheet to shroud me for my tomb? 154 Though Justice, righteous Sir, might you persuade To aid our necessary mutiny; Yet Pity too on Geusis's part doth plead For present succour's alms before I dy. O had these Teeth on Psyche's heart their will Their wrongs how deeply would they make her feel? 155 She closing here, and champing her fell lips, Ev'n in her silence still spake spight and rage: Which Haphe echoing, forth right coily trips And shews her sullen face upon the Stage. With mute Disdain she her stern preface makes, And having look'd Contempt, Contempt she speaks: 156 'Tis well you'll deign me leave to be the last; Yet goodly Sisters, when, I pray, would you Have felt those Wrongs of yours, had I not past Through all your Lodgings, and inform'd you how? 'Tis by my Touch alone that you resent What object yields Delight, what Discontent. 157 You to your proper Cells confinèd are, Which also stand in my Dominions, Whose limits are extended far and near Through flesh and blood and skin: indeed some Bones Are obstinate; but to thy teeth I tell Thee Geusis, they sometimes my power feel. 158 What haste, Anamnesis? yet I'm contented, Come bless their eyes: At this proud-yielding word She on the scene her Tactile sweets presented: With curious Ermin's stately mantles furr'd, Illustrious robes of Satin and of silk, And wanton Lawns, more soft and white than milk. 159 Delicious Beds of cygnet's purest Down, Cushions of Roses, Lilies, Violets; Bathes of perfumèd oiles, footpaths thick strown With budding Summer's undeflowrèd sweets; Stoves which could Autumn of cold Winter make, Fountains in Autumn to bring Winter back. 160 Soft Ticklings, Courtings, Kisses, Dalliance, Embraces which no modest Muse must tell; For all the Company at their first glance Started and turn'd from that bold spectacle. Which Haphe marking, insolently cries, Out, out on these demure Hypocrisies. 161 What mean you your vain heads to turn aside When still your itching hearts are hankering here! Fools! what your eyes pretend not to abide Your hungry Thoughts esteem their choicest chear: Talk not of shame; I to your selves appeal Is't shame to see what all desire to feel? 162 Yet though this solemn and substantial joy I offer Psyche, most ingrateful She Starts more than you, and barbarously coy Makes war upon my solid Courtesy: Just as the clownish Rocks in pieces dash The streams, which gently come their sides to wash. 163 Faint on the ground's cold bed she makes me lie, There to corrupt my flesh and suck diseases, And measure out my grave before I die: Some cloth of hemp, or hair, or what she pleases, Must those furrs' place usurp: poor Haphe, who Ne'r peeps abroad, must like a Pilgrim go. 164 With churlish stroaks on this soft tender breast, As of some Anvil, 'tis her trade to beat With an unnat'ral Hammer, mine own fist. She scorns, grave Sir, the service of my feet, And dwelling always on my weary Knee Relentless Tyrant lames her self and me. 165 Although my livid soreness be now spread About me round, she still regardless goes, And will go on, till force her spight forbid. This has confederated me with those My injur'd sisters, all resolv'd to try The strength of Right against her Tyranny. 166 The Plaintiffs thus their several Cases spread Open before their common Censor: He Shaking with serious Look his thoughtful head, Some pause allowèd to his Gravity; At length he cry'd, The matter's foul, I see, And doth include with yours, my Injury. 167 Your Resolution's just and noble too: But still I must advise you to Agree, Least you by factious jealousy undo The joints which knit up your Conspiracy. A mutinous Army only hastes to lose The field, before it to the battle goes. 168 But more Confederates were not amiss The easier to dispatch your great Design: That discontented Troop which scatter'd is About the Heart, will in your Plot combine: And lo my faithful Sister Fancy there, Whom you may trust your embassy to bear. 169 She all this while behind them sate, and as Their several Pageants and Complaints came out, Straight caught them pris'ners in her crystal glass, And then their figures in her Sampler wrought. She needed no Instructions what to say, But being ask'd to go she flies away. 170 For launching on the nimble wings of Thought Forthwith to her designèd port she sails; Where, in the Lodgings scatter'd round about The Court of Psyche, she her face unvails. The Passions flock'd to kiss her, and to know What welcome News she from abroad could show. 171 The News is this, said she; and instantly Taught her, fine airy figures, to present All that was spoke, or shew'd, or plotted by The angry Senses; adding what intent Had spurr'd her thither. They a while amaz'd, Upon the guileful Apparition gaz'd. 172 Then taking fire, and being too stout their own Wraths' flames to bridle, thus they belch'd them out: Surely, said they our Queen flat foe is grown, To her most trusty friends. 'Twas not for nought That we our selves complain'd; 'tis certain she Means now to rage and open Tyrant be. 173 If their great distance cannot Them remove From her injustice, then no wonder we Who live more in her reach, so often prove The prey whereon she feasts her Cruelty. We in their Plot against our common foe Think it most just to join; and tell them so. 174 Though theirs the honor be to have begun This righteous insurrection; yet they Shall find that we will lead our forces on With such resolvèd might, that our Delay Shall more than be excusèd, when our Rage Shall once appear upon the Battel's stage. 175 Let them be sure to watch their Ports without, And leave the bus'ness here within for us; Who are not now to learn how to be stout And stomachful and rude and mutinous. That Word rais'd Fancy's smile, right glad to see Success so quickly crown her Embassy. 176 Whose Issue when she to the Senses told, They all would in devotion needs blaspheme; Thrusting loud thanks on God, as if their bold Sedition had been patroniz'd by Him; And now with traiterous expectation swell'd, They wait to see the Passions take the field. 177 But Hope, Love, Hatred, Anger, and the rest Of that impatient crew had forthwith been In open arms, had cautious Fear not prest For some demur, and to his party won Deep-thinking Jealousy: 'Tis best, said he, We of some valiant Leader first agree. 178 Psyche is strong and sober: if we fight Without due Discipline, that Rashness will But hurry our own Pow'rs to speedier flight: But if we make some expert General's skill Our own by following it, the Victory Will grow ambitious on our side to be. 179 That Word a new Confusion broach'd, for all Reach'd at the General's lofty Place, but Fear And Jealousy; yet these abhorr'd to fall Under the absolute power of any there, And equally in doubt and dread did stand, Both of subjection, and of Command. 180 Long their Ambitions justled one another, (For who is best where all alike are bad By common Treason?) and yet loth to smother Their traiterous Wrath in their own Strife, they made A Vote at last, to step abroad and see Who skilléd best feats of Activity. 181 When lo (so well Hell's plots were lay'd) they met A goodly Person, to whose cedar head All theirs like shrubs appear'd: Disdain did sit High on his brows, his awful limbs were spread To such extent of gallantry, that there Seem'd ample room for every thing but fear. 182 At his first glimpse their wishes all concenter On portly Him: Love forthwith is design'd To break to this brave Knight their bold Adventure, And with her wiley sweetness sift his mind. She hastens to her Task; and bowing low, From her mouth's fount lets this inchantment flow. 183 Might's goodly Mirror, whosoe'r you be Whom blesséd fortune shews us here alone; Surely such fair commanding Majesty Deserves by thousands to be waited on: And, if such honor you this Troop will deign, We shall have found a Lord, and you a Train. 184 An high Design hath fir'd us now, which may Your Might and Soverain Command become: Upon a War with Psyche we to day Resolvèd have: but kind fate kept us from Choosing our General; and we hope our stay Was but for you, whom Heav'n puts in our way. 185 This League was knit by strong Necessity, To break that Yoke which else our necks would break: Would Psyche suffer us ourselves to be, No mutiny of ours her throne should shake; But we, though Passions, calm and tame must lie Whilst she proves passionate ev'n to Tyranny. 186 We must not Hope, nor Fear, nor Love, nor Hate, Nor do the things for which we all were born: If fouler slavery e'r did violate Free-Subjects' birthright; our sad sufferings scorn: If not; O may the just Relief be ours, Great Sir, by your stout hand; the Glory yours. 187 Agenor glad such punctual ready Bliss Did on his own Design itself obtrude; Swell'd his vast Looks to bigger stateliness: Three turns he stalk'd, three times he proudly view'd The Company, three times he snuff'd, and then Opening his mouth at leisure thus began: 188 Now by my glorious Power, all you I know, But silly Brats I see you know not me, Whom to so vile a piece of Work you woo As bridling wretchéd Psyche's Tyranny. Must I, whom Lyons, Tigres, Dragons fear, Debase my Strength, and stoop to conquer Her? 189 If of the great Kind she a Monster were, Or e'r had made distresséd Countries fly To Shrines and Oracles on wings of fear, To summon to their help a Deity; If she could prove a Thirteenth Task for Him Who Twelve atchiev'd, the Work would me beseem, 190 But to unsheath my Valour at a fly, And pitch the field against a simple Worm; To mount my Sinews' great Artillery A female despicable Fort to storm; More honor on the Captive's head would heap Than on my Hand which did that Conquest reap. 191 Yet since so deep I your Oppression see, I'l win thus much on my high-practis'd Might To make it bow to your delivery. But never say Agenor came to fight: I scorn the match; this finger will be strong Enough to prove my Pity of your Wrong. 192 This said, He march'd in more than warlike state Up to the House where thoughtful Psyche lay: And thund'ring imperiously at the gate, Unto the Rebel's rage burst ope the way. Loud rung the Ruin, and with boistrous fear Strait revel'd in the Queen's amazéd ear. 193 As when the Winds let loose upon the Sea, Tear up the Deeps and fling them at the Stars; Chasing away unarm'd Serenity With bold alarms of unsuspected wars; The startled Nymphs their fearful heads shrink in, And down into the world's dark bottom run: 194 So Psyche, trembling at the furious Cry, Retreated to her inmost Fort; a place Profound and strong, from whence her jealous Eye Might safely view the Rebels: Time it was To call her Counsellor; whom to the Rout With these Instructions she dispatcheth out: 195 Run Logos, run, and learn what mad mistake Hurls those my Subjects into tumult: Try, (For well thou skill'st that gentle Might) to break Their furie's torrent by the lenity Of wise Persuasion; Pardon, of all charms The best, proclaim to all who lay down arms. 196 He at this odd News shakes his head; but yet Right sagely-pleasant to the Traitors goes. And Friends, said he, If you be in a fit Of fighting, then in God's name seek your foes. This is your peaceful Home; O be it far From you to ruin your own Rest by War. 197 Did any Reason prompt you to rebel; How could it 'scape from being known to Me? Your Queen what would it boot you to expel, Who needs must in her ruins buried be? What gains the mad-man, who through jealous fears Pulls his own house, and death, about his ears? 198 What means sweet Love to rob herself of all Herself, in playing peevish Discord's part? Must th'universal Glue, which binds the Ball Of this fair world so close, in pieces start? Shall thy dear Bands serve only now to ty Destruction fast to your Conspiracy? 199 Stern Hatred, could the copious world afford No other Prey whereon to feast thy spight; But thou against thyself must draw thy sword In venturing against thy Queen to fight? O hate what hateful is, but hate not her, Whose love gives thee thy life and dwelling here. 200 What strange Enchantments luréd Thee, fond Hope, To this design of self-destruction? Who Abus'd thy credulous soul, and puff'd thee up With mad supposal that the Ladder to Exhalt thee, must be Ruin? Thus art Thou Of Hope become plain Desperation now. 201 Unhappy Fear, and what makes thee afraid To dwell in thine own Happinesse's Port? What monstrous Witchery hath now betray'd To this bold Mutiny thy trembling Heart? What hardneth thee, who quak'st at every frown Of other Princes, to despise thine own? 202 Brave Anger, shall the scoffing world at last Have cause to mock thy Valour, whilst it makes Such earnest haste unto so wild a Jest As waging war against its own mistakes? What pity 'tis to see thou art so fair And well appointed when no Danger's near? 203 And you my Fellow-subjects all, whom I Have often heard our gracious Sovereign praise For humble Duty and fidelity; O why must groundless Rashness now erase That noble Character, and in its stead Print foul Rebellion's blot on your fair head? 204 By your Allegiance and ingenerate worth, By your own Lives, and dearer Loyalty, By Psyche's royal Head, by Heav'n and Earth, By every thing, I you conjure to be True to yourselves: The Queen desires but this, Who by your Peace and weal counts her own bliss. 205 Suspect not that this Paroxysm, which hath Your honesty abuséd; or the Art Of that bold Stranger who applies your wrath To his own Envy's end, can spur her heart To such revenge, that she cannot forgive Those in whose Happiness her life doth live. 206 No; she is readier to forget, than you Can be your hasty Error to lay down: She on your necks by me her arms doth throw, And by my Tongue she calls you still her own: Behold the Pledge of her Embraces here, A General Pardon all your Doubts to clear. 207 As when soft Oil on raging fire you throw, Forthwith the fretful flames incensèd by Its gentleness, more fierce and rampant grow: So here the unrelenting mutinous fry Storm'd at persuasive Logos, and to new Impatience at his sweet Oration grew. 208 He's an Enchanter, Anger cry'd, and by These blandishments hath oft bewitchèd Us: But our mature and just Conspiracy Scorns to be foolèd and confutèd thus. 'Tis time to act our Resolutions now, That Reason's may no longer us undo. 209 Then clapping her right paw full on his throat, And stopping with her left his mouth, she drew Him to Agenor, crying, Now w' have got Our subtlest Foe, Sir, let him have his due. We never shall our warlike bus'ness do, If to the Tyrant back in peace he go. 210 The other Passions strait rebounded that Rebellious word; whose General glad to see Their madness compass what his pride could not, Gave order Logos should close Pris'ner be. They hollowing all for joy, made desperate haste Two chains upon his neck and mouth to cast. 211 And here I challenge any heart to read This storie's riddles, and forbear to sigh; Seeing servile feet tread down the noble Head, And common Slaves with tyrannous Licence fly Upon their Lord: O who secure can be, When Reason must be bound, and Passion free! 212 What woful Consequents must make the train Of those false-naméd Subjects Insolence, Who blush not with contempt to entertain The Messages of their most yeilding Prince: Who have no power because they strong are grown Or Loyalty or Modesty to own. 213 Psyche, whom all this while suspicion had Held watching at the window of her Tower, When she descry'd from thence how fiercely mad And confident of their outrageous Power The Rebels were; and that in foul disdain Her Messenger they did in Bonds detain: 214 She fetch'd a mighty sigh; and though with Him Herself and all her Honor, Pris'ners were; Between Despairs and Hopes she long did swim, Yet could her course into no harbor steer. For her own fancies to such tumults rose, As copied out her loud tempestuous foes. 215 Thus by that Noise without, and this within, She Summon'd was unto the top of fear. Her trusty Phylax now would not be seen, Nor can she any News of Charis hear. No friend was left but Thelema; and she Was thought but wavering in fidelity. 216 But as the shipwrack'd Man toss'd up and down Between high deaths and low, amongst the Waves; Claps fast on any glimpse of help, and grown Bold by despair, nor hold nor comfort leaves As long's his poor plank floats: So Psyche now On Thelema her sinking arms did throw. 217 And O, she cry'd, my only Refuge, I Conjure thee well to mark thy Hap and mine The Tempest of my Woes is swoll'n so high, That now all bridles it disdains but thine: And 'tis thy Privilege, that I to thee Must ow my life, for thy sake dear to me. 218 At any price would'st Thou some way have bought Which might so deep engage thy Queen to thee: Yet monstrous hadst thou been, if thou hadst sought This sad unnatural opportunity. But now their Disobedience ope's the way For thy Desert if thou wilt me obey. 219 Logos had prov'd himself both wise and strong, Had obstinate Spight not damméd up their ears: But all his Powers fighting from his tongue, Their deaf Rebellion his Assaults outdares. His Arguments confuted are with Chains, And I fear, in prison He remains. 220 But thy brave Valour reigneth in thy Hands, O most incomparable Amazon; Whose noble stroke no Adamant withstands, No Subtilty eludes: Thy Nod alone Points out thy Victories; fresh laurel groves Court thy subduing foot where'r it moves. 221 By softness fain I would have conquer'd Them, No blast of whose Rebellion could blow out My royal Love, which towards them did flame: But now their Madness challengeth a stout And corsive Cure; thy Hand must do the Deed, And through their Wounds not fear my blood to shed. 222 O how my Soul at that sad Word recoils, And at the thought of Blood aforehand bleeds! What gains a Prince but loss, by winning Spoils From his fond Subjects! Yet since fate will needs Thus cruel make my Safety; be it so: Though tender I start back, Thou on shalt go. 223 Go then my faithful Champion, and may Blessèd Success march in thy company. I'l from this window wait upon thy way By my observing and well-wishing Eye; Which shall the witness of thy valor be, And what Reward it shall deserve from me. 224 But fail not to revenge the proud intrusion Of yon ignoble Stranger, who may be Perhaps the firebrand of this wild Confusion Which threatens to burn up both Thee and Me: And if his blood will serve to quench this fire, Spare all the rest; they will no more Conspire. 225 Stout Thelema with this Commission went, And by imperious Looks built up her brow. The Passions struck by that commanding Dint Down all their eyes and arms and courage threw: Only Agenor's stomach rose to see Himself out-look'd in high-swol'n Majesty. 226 But knowing his own Weakness, and her Might, And seeing all the Passions turn'd to fear; He judg'd it safest now to change the fight Of Arms to that of Wit: for in Love's ear He whisper'd his device; and straitway she At Thelema let fly this Fallacy. 227 Illustrious Lady, you to-day might spare Those ireful Looks, with which Mistake hath plow'd Your awful face: How can you think we dare So far forget our nothing, as with proud Madness to whet our Sword and bend our Bow To make war with Omnipotence, and you? 228 But as your strength is great, so is your love, Whom we our noble Friend have always found: How often has your courteous Goodness strove To ease that Yoke whose weight our Patience ground? O had our Sovereign been as mild as you, Despair had not been all our Comfort now. 229 But though our loyal service day by day Strain'd all its strength Her favor to obtain; Still her remorseless Cruelty doth lay Upon our bruiséd necks a heavier chain; And hating Love's and Pity's thoughts, she still With lingering Death delighteth us to kill. 230 Arms, Arms, are our sole (forcéd) Refuge; for Though your all-brawny Might knows how to bear What wrongs soe'r her spight on you can pour, Our shoulders of a feebler temper are: Nor can you judge it guilt in us, if we Shrink more than you from her broad Tyranny. 231 Hearing what constant slavery she heap'd On our poor backs, who yet were all free-born, This noble Stranger mercifully weep'd, And thought it Honor's duty not to scorn Our sad estate: Then far far be it you Our ancient friend should more than Stranger grow. 232 Yet perish if we must, our Miseries Beg but this woful Courtesy of you: Return us not to Psyche, who denies Us Brevity of torments: Lo we throw Ourselves before your gentle feet, and pray Our lives and griefs may see no other day. 233 Nay doubt not, Die we dare; but dare not think Of living in our former Death again. If from the fatal blow our necks but shrink, Then say, We truly wish'd not to be slain. Here take our willing swords; which in your hand Though not in ours, our servitude may end. 234 As when the cunning Reeds relent and bow In low submission to the boistrous Wind; And with their whining pipe their sorrows blow To every Blast, compassion's alms to find: Way to their charm the generous Tempest gives, And passing forward, them their Pardon leaves. 235 So portly Thelema allayéd by Their fauning homage, bid them all arise. They, strait unveiling ready Memory, In fraudulent thanks presented to her eyes The stately Pageant Fancy thither brought, With their own Treasures amplier furnish'd out. 236 She look'd, and wonder'd, and let through her eye The soft Deceit get stealing to her heart. She never yet did at one view descry So huge an Army of Delight, such Art Of sweetness, such Magnificence of Pleasure, Such equipage of Smiles and Joys and Leisure. 237 Election, who stood musing at her hand, Was ne'r at such a dainty loss as here: Her thoughts ten thousand sweets examin'd, and Hover'd in gazing doubt which to prefer. So in the flowry Mead fond Children loose Their eyes, before they can resolve to choose. 238 The Rebels seeing now their crafty Bait Went down without suspicion of the Hook; Bid Love drive home the plot: She melting strait Down on her bended knee, with flattering Look And pliant words, endeavor'd thus to teach Sturdy Rebellion meek Submission's speech: 239 Since this our full apparent Magazine, Which thy just Eyes are pleas'd not to disdain, No more respect can from fell Psyche's win, Than froward glances of contempt; again We beg, that we may never live to see Such sweets betray'd to further slavery. 240 The bounteous heav'n, and Earth, and Air, and Sea Have made our Treasury their own by this Their royal Contribution: Yet must we Our own possessions no more possess, Nor reap the fruit of what the World's consent In this rich Mass heaps up for our content. 241 O no! it is in vain that we are by The generous universe thus favoréd, Whilst Psyche's envious Barbarity, And not our Mouths are by its bounty fed. What patrons for this fierceness can she find, When all the world besides to us are kind? 242 To us, and to our fellow-sufferers, who Her faithful factors are in Senses trade. A most unhappy faithfulness, which no Acceptance finds! they all together plead With woful us, desirous all our last Anchor of hope on righteous Thee to cast. 243 Now by thy mighty Goodness we implore Relief for our loud-crying Injuries. So to thy service this exuberant store We sacrifice; no despicable Price Of thy Compassion, if the total gains Of Nature's wealth be worth thy smallest pains. 244 So thy sole Beck shall be the Law whereby Obligéd we our lives will regulate: So great Agenor will unite in thy Acquaintance, and this morning consecrate To peaceful smiles, whose ominous Dawn was red With flashes of fierce War and streaks of Blood. 245 As when the shepherd loitering by the side Of some soft-murmuring Current, lets his ears Drink that complaining story of the Tide; The purling Dialect soon domineers O'r his inchanted spirits, and down he lies Both to the noise and sleep, an easy prize: 246 So Thelema, who linger'd all this while In idle audience of Love's blandishments, Was now subduéd by her glozing guile, And to the Rebel's fair-tongu'd Plot consents. Her hankering arms she with their treasures fills, Her foolish heart with joy, her face with smiles. 247 And well I see, she cries, how righteous is Your Cause and Quarrel: Heav'n forbid that I To such deep undeservéd miseries The justice of Compassion should deny. Yet Pity is not all that I can show: You know this Hand hath greater might than so. 248 Alas not Psyche's self, although she be My granted Sovereign, can make me bend: Oft do I rush and range abroad, when she Would lock me up; and oft when she would send Me forth, except my pleasure be to stir, I stay in spight of all her strength and Her. 249 And, well aware of this, prudential she Wav'd all her state, and su'd to me for aid In meek pathetic flattery, when ye Had bravely learn'd her how to be afraid. I heard her fauning prayers: and I could Have stayed; but I came, Because I would. 250 'Twas I first taught your Pris'ner Logos how To bear a chain; else you had strove in vain. Long, long have I accustom'd Him to bow To my least finger his strong-reaching Brain: And though sometimes I let him wrangle, yet Reason has no more power than I permit. 251 The universal strength of all you see Throughout the wide-spread world look big and high, Ne'r yet made combination which could be Valid enough to bind my Potency. Hence 'tis that stoutest Champions from their knee Fight by Petitions, when they deal with me. 252 They talk of Samson,—one, I must confess Fame hath not quite bely'd; and yet we see A Wenche's sheers clipt off his Mightiness, And trimm'd him fit for his captivity. Alas, poor Giant, all his strength hung loose About his ears; mine in my heart lies close. 253 Nay Heav'n (without a brag I speak't) does know My might so thoroughly, that it ne'r would try By rightdown force of Arms my neck to bow, But by allurements strives to mollify My hardy Heart. And well it is that ye Have took that gentle only course with me. 254 As for your choice of this illustrious Knight To head your Party, I dispute it not. His worth forestals exception: though in right My vote should first have been expected, but You by my pardon of that haste may know What serious Pity I your Case allow. 255 This said, Agenor by the hand she takes, And bids him welcome with a courtly Kiss. He, soldier-like, right proud repaiment makes In arrogant high-languag'd Promises; And swears, by all his Conquests, she shall find That with a Man indeed sh' had now combin'd. 256 Then to his fair Pavilion ushering Her, His Soldiers he to Council summons: They As proud's their haughty General, thither tear With rampant Acclamations their way; And there contrive by joint deliberation The rest of their Adventure how to fashion. CANTO V. The Pacification. The ARGUMENT. Love on the Rebel's part with Psyche treats, Whose fair Tale Thelema and Agenor back: And she deluded by their fauning cheats Makes league with them, and huggs her own mistake. Then muffling up Syneidesis at home, In wanton pride she joys abroad to rome. 1 What boots it Man, that Nature's Courtesy Lifting his awful Looks high towards Heav'n, Hath built his Temples up with Majesty, And into's Hand imperial Power given? What royal Nonsence is a Diadem Abroad, for One who's not at home supreme? 2 How do's this wide world mock him, when it lays Its universal Homage at his feet; Whom whilst the Air, the Earth, the Sea obeys, A saucy pack of Passions dare to meet With plain defiance; and presume to hope His Empire shall go down, their Pleasure up. 3 How miserably fond's the Vaunt, that He On every Monstrous Thing his Conquests builds; That Tigres, Lions, Dragons, forcéd be By Him to learn submission; That he wields Art's moving Mountains, and through widest Seas Commands his Ships to reach what World he please: 4 If his own Vessel's helm unruly grow, And fling him into fatal Tempest's jaws; If his domestic Slaves disdain to bow Their worthless necks to his most equal Laws; And fill his Court with more outrageous Beasts Than are the Salvage Desert's wildest guests: 5 Alas poor Prince, whose feeble Royalty Becomes the game and Scoff of vilest Things! How much are Worms, who of themselves can be Intire Commanders, more substantial Kings! Intestine Rebels never trouble Worms, But Psyche's toss'd and torn with civil Storms. 6 So toss'd, so torn; that sadly now at last She finds the most unreasonable Dress, Which can a reasonable Soul invest, To be the light loose garb of Carelesness; Whose gently-looking beauties only do Inamour Ruin, and Destruction wo. 7 She from her Palace-window saw her Grief Muster'd in terrible battalia: In vain within she hunted for relief Where only empty Desolation lay: Logos and Thelema were absent, He To violence Pris'ner, to Enchantment she. 8 At home indeed Syneidesis stay'd still, But by her stay made Tortures do so too; For she the guilt of this Rebellion full In wounded Psyche's face fear'd not to throw. Blame not the Passions, said she, if they Revolt; You to their Treason op'd the way. 9 Had you been careful how your Might to wield, And in due time approv'd your self a Queen; Your royal Chariot's reins strait had you held, And resolutely driv'n; your Beasts had been Themselves, as loyal still to you and mild, As now they traiterous are become and wild. 10 When in a stealing preface to the flood The first Streams slily creep; with ease may we Reduce the Straglers to their proper road: But if we slight what seems so weak to be, They grow upon us strait; disdaining more Our strength, than we their weakness did before. 11 Your Greatness scorn'd those breeding Garboils; you Forsooth on Safety's wings sate mounted high. And what's that silly Rivulet come to now? What wants it of a Sea's immensity? A Sea it is; which though perhaps it may Not cleanse your Crime, can wash your Life away. 12 How many a foul Repulse did I Digest, And still with faithful constancy pursue My Dutie's part! how often have I prest For timely Justice on that mutinous Crew! But in my Counsels I was too severe: Yes, doubtless; witness all those Rebels there. 13 And where is Charis, where is Phylax now? O you were too secure their aid to need; And well could spare them for poor Heav'n, since you In your own Realm a Sovereign are indeed. The case is plain; See how your Subjects stand With ready duty waiting your Command. 14 Unhappy Psyche stung by these reproaches, Profoundly feels the wound dive in her heart; Which with her blood her lamentations broaches, And thus she streameth out her double smart: Nay then I pardon them without, if Thou Upon my heavy Griefs more load dost throw. 15 Cruel Syneidesis, why stayd'st thou here, To grinde my dying Soul with nearer rage? More mannerly's Their Crime who vex me there At distance: Must my bosom be the stage Of thy more dangerous undermining Wrath, Which from my very heart digs out my Death? 16 Are these thy thanks to me; whose favour kept Thee next myself, and hugg'd thee in my breast? How little dream'd I that a Viper slept In this my nearest and my dearest Nest! Yet be assur'd, by knawing thy out way, That thou thyself no less than me shalt slay. 17 The Privilege of other Vipers Thou, More barbarous far, in vain expect'st; for they To their fell Dames that decent Vengeance ow Which by sage Nature's righteous Law they pay. But surely Thou art of a kinder breed; Thy Matricide all pardon must exceed. 18 Yet what gain I by seeing Thee undone, Or those thy fellow-Elves who there rebel? Unfortunate me, who cannot die alone, But in my single Death all yours must feel! Thus Miserie's prodigious Riddle, I Am now betrayéd oft at once to die. 19 But this is all the pity Princes find When Rebels once are grown as strong as bold: All faults and all miscarriages are joyn'd Into one cruel odious Mass, and roll'd Upon their Sovereigns' Backs; although their sin Hath nothing but their too much Goodness been. 20 Here stern Syneidesis, who knew full well She on irrefragable Truth did lay The ground of all her actions, 'gan to swell With confident Scorn; and yet a while gave way, Since she her sharp but loyal part had done To see what Psyche meant: who thus went on: 21 O Charis! would'st not thou bid me adieu, But by discourteous parting, leave my heart Unarm'd, because unwarnéd? Grant it true That thou no reason read'st in my desert To stay thee here; my misery at least Might woo thy Charity to be my Guest. 22 Wilt thou abandon me, o Phylax too, Who hast so oft 'twixt me and danger spread Thy Wing's impenetrable Shield? That Foe On whom thy Conquest in the Grove did tread, Was but a single fiend: why then shall thy Brave Hand not reap this fairer victory? 23 How shall I grapple with this arméd crew Confederate against my desolate head, Whom one smug Cheater did so soon subdue? What reason then soever wing'd thy speed To my Relief, is multipliéd here: What lames thy pity now, what deafs thine ear? 24 O Prince of this my consecrated breast, O thou whose Majesty did not disdain A suit to worthless me, but oft profest By thy Ambassador thy amorous pain And sweet-tormenting longings for my Love: What makes thy tender Heart forgetful prove? 25 Hadst thou for ever not remembred me, I had not mockéd been with Tasts of Bliss. Why did not Aphrodisius's Treachery Prevent the worse extremity of this? That soft and single death why dy'd not I, But am reserv'd a thousand times to die? 26 Some happiness of misery it were, Might I be murder'd by my barbarous foes: But must my homebred Powers the Standard rear Against my Life? Must I be slain by those Who by my influence live, and who must die Unless I 'scape their mad Conspiracy. 27 What gain accrues to my Soul's Treasury That I so long did Fast, so often Pray? What brake that Bottle wont of old to be The Store-house of Devotion's tears? what Pay Have all my faithful amorous groans and sighs, If I must prove mine own slave's sacrifice? 28 What meant this Token, which did gird my heart So close to thee, who casts me now away! Was this the farewel thou didst me impart When thou some other Love hadst chose, which may Monopolize thy constant favors, and In banish'd Psyche's place for ever stand? 29 No wonder if my Passions mutinous prove, Breaking that yoke which bound their Faith to me; If blesséd Jesus can unty his Love Knit in this spousal-knot of Chastity. How can I longer be displeas'd with them, Unless I could and dar'd fall out with Him? 30 Am I unworthy? so I was before: Yet he vouchsaf'd my Nothing to accept. Sure then, I now am sunk beneath the poor Region of vilest nothing, and have kept But what is worse than nullity, a mere Capacity, Calamities to bear. 31 O all my Joys, take Psyche's long adieu, And find some dwelling where you may have room: My tumid Griefs have left no place for you, But made my whole usurpéd heart their home; And more than so; far must you get you hence To 'scape my Sorrows' vast circumference. 32 And you, poor Hopes, your time no longer loose In hankering here in my despairing breast: Away, away unhappy things, and choose In any place but this a fortunate Nest. Be confident your choice can never err, For all Misfortunes are collected here. 33 But rage, rage on, o my Disconsolations, For I resign myself your total Prey: Some ease 'tis to defy Woe's Insultations, When still to look, and look in vain, for Joy, Doubles self-torment: why should I alone, When all things hate me else, my self bemoan? 34 Whilst thus she fries in desolate vexations, The Rebels at their Council busy were: Where tir'd with hard and knotty Consultations Which way their traiterous design to steer; Up rose Suspicion, and first looking over Each shoulder, thus her judgment did discover: 35 Princely Agenor, in Truth's sober scale Weighty and great's the work we have in hand; Let not our caution then be light or small: Haste may be good, when once we understand The way is clear; if otherwise, to run, Is only with more speed to be undone. 36 Hope's Arguments are plausible; but yet She, flitting She, alone is their foundation: I doubt our Enterprize's base will not Stand sure on any thing but Demonstration. I should be loth to fight, but where I may Do something more than hope to win the day. 37 Anger's Advice is sound, if Psyche were So weak a Prince as her opinion makes her: But on what Rocks shall we our Vessel steer, By this untried Card, if she mistakes her? Fear, would she speak, could shew you such a List Of Psyche's Powers, as soon would cool our haste. 38 Alas, how can we force her hold, if She Deny to yield when we our Battery make? Are not those Walls and Gates apparently Of pure immortal Metal? We may break Our Engins and our plots and fury too, And sooner our own selves than her undo. 39 A lingering Leaguer, what can that effect, Unless we dream at length to starve her out? But she long since to throw secure neglect On all the Dainties of the world was taught, Her Prayers and her Heaven her diet were, And now she's strait besieg'd, she best doth fare. 40 But as for us who at the siege must lie, We, fed with hope of Victory, must starve Before we get it: for with what supply, Or whence shall we provided be to serve So many mouths; which Psyche fill'd till now; And if she up be shut, they must be too. 41 The Senses true and trusty are; but these Can lend us no assistance here, so narrow And difficult are all the passages Which hither lead: Besides, could they march thorough, They by our hands must fight, not by their own, And do no more than we may act alone. 42 I could be confident, were but the Queen Divorc'd from all her friends: but well I know That she her Tell-truth keepeth still within, And by her Oracle perhaps may grow Too wise for us; for sage Syneidesis, In all her Councils deep and sober is. 43 Nay who can tell but some of her Allies Phylax or Charis, or some other friend May rush upon our backs, and by surprize Both our Design and us in pieces rend? Fresh is the Lesson in the Grove we read; Can you forget how Aphrodisius sped? 44 Besides, y' have heard of Heaven's immortal Son Whose sovereign hand holds fate's and power's rein: That hand which when great Lucifer begun To let his eyes but glimmer with disdain; Tumbled him headlong into Death and Hell: I tell you friends, that Christ loves Psyche well. 45 Since then apparent hazards close attend Our rightdown force; I cannot find how we Shall answer Wisdom's scruples, if we bend Against her castle our Artillery. Should we at first be worsted, what Recruit Can heal our Army, or our crack'd Repute? 46 Fear not that we should prove too wary; I For my part judge the safest way the best: And this is by a present Embassy With humble Lies and Oaths and Glozings drest; To cheat her from her strength, and wisely gain Our ends, yet seem to 'scape Rebellion's stain. 47 But let a vow of Perseverance first Seal us all sure to our Conspiracy; That they aforehand may be self-accurst Whoe'r shall faint or false Apostates be. If one should basely fail, why may not two? If two, why may the sum not higher grow? 48 This said: An eye of learing Doubt she cast Upon Agenor, to observe how He Relish'd her words: But soon she saw their taste In's palate welcome found; for instantly, I like her Council best he cries, and you Shall strengthen your Adventure by a vow. 49 Thus shall my might avoid, what most I fear'd, The vile encountre with a Woman; and No less to you my Pity be declar'd, Whilst in your front my Majesty doth stand; And strike such terror, ev'n without a blow, As to your Plot shall make your Empress bow. 50 Then calling for a Bason and a Pin, He pricks his annular finger, and lets fall Three drops of blood: strait, what he thus begun As solemnly reacted was by all The Company; which done, again he takes The Bason, and three elevations makes. 51 And may the total streams of blood behind Be forc'd to follow these three drops, he cry'd; If ever I unbend my resolute Mind, Or from this War's stout prosecution slide. May this my present poison be (and here He dipp'd his tongue) if I be not sincere. 52 Then sprinkling on the back of his right hand Another drop: this martial mark, said he, Shall for a badge and memorandum stand Of our resolv'd and sacred Unity. You see our Covenant's Rites: Now every One Do what your willing General has done. 53 No jolly Health more chearly walk'd its round When lusty Wine and Mirth the boul had fill'd; Than did this bloody barbarous Bason, crown'd With Rage and madness. Their Rebellion seal'd Thus by this desperate Ceremony, they To Psyche, speed the Messenger away. 54 And this was Love, on whose quaint tongue although There dwelt perpetual fallacies and sleights; Yet with industrious Deceptions now And study'd flatteries her mouth she baits: She knew the Queen was wise and strong and would With common known Delusions not be fool'd. 55 Thus to the gate demurely come, she try'd It with a modest knock, and paus'd a while: Then dropping a more timorous stroke, she hid In this soft Preface her meek-insolent guile. The gentle Knocks bad Psyche courage take To come and see what they would further speak. 56 No sooner had she op'd a wicket, and Reach'd out her doubtful Eye the News to know; But she beheld the Maiden trembling stand With weeping eyes, and with dejected brow. She lik'd the posture; yet demanded why She thither came, a false and fauning Spy? 57 Love by that word alarm'd, to skrew her art, Fell on her knees, and smote her bowéd breast; And, Wo is me, she cry'd, whose loyal heart By my most dear, though ireful Sovereign's thrust Quite thro' and thro'! What strange mischance doth throw This wrong on Me, and that mistake on You? 58 If thus to visit you in humblest guise Who here immuréd dwell in Desolation; If to discover where the Error lies Whose secret Venom breeds this Perturbation Of your whole Realm, deserve the name of Spy; I well can bear this glorious Infamy. 59 But if Suspicion so deludes your eyes, That, looking with a jealous glance on me, They in my Count'nance read an Enemy's; Just leave I crave to tell your Majesty (For it concerns my essence,) you forget Your Creature, and take Love itself for Hate. 60 Yet your mistake shall force no change in me; Use your vast pow'r wherever else you please. I still am Love, and so resolve to be, Not fearing that false envious witnesses Can swear me from myself: Heav'n cannot frame What I had rather be than what I am. 61 Sure I with that right genuine Love which you Hug next your soul, have some affinity; Adulterate can that virgin Passion grow, And stain its spotless self with Treachery? Can Odours stinking, Honey bitter be, Silk harsh, Down hard, that thus you judge of me? 62 Can hatred-hating Lambs imployéd be The message of blood-thirsty wolves to bear; And that, (with self-destroying villany) To their own best-deserving Shepherd's ear? Can mildest Doves upon an errand from Rapacious Kites, and salvage Vultures come? 63 O no, misdeeming Sovereign; I am sent The soft Ambassador of Peace to you: Nor of my Office must it me repent What wrath soe'r stands bent in your stern brow: And though I know not what will hence ensue, I to my native sweetness must be true. 64 I see you fear'd your Members there had bent Some trait'rous force against their royal Head: And is't not likely they would all consent Their own heart-blood and life in yours to shed? Madam, believe 't, Self's not a dearer Name To noble You, than to the worst of Them. 65 Might I be bold to judge, (and may I speak Under your favor's shelter,) I should swear Your Highness now is only pleas'd to take Suspicion's mask, and try how they will bear A forg'd imaginary guilt; since in Their faithful breasts, you find no real sin. 66 'Tis true, a piece of Discontent has put Them in that posture of Defence: but by Heav'n, and more heav'nly You, they brew no plot But what becomes true Subjects' modesty. Were mischief their Design, what Power's charms Now dead their hands and damp their glittering arms? 67 If strong-embattel'd injur'd Patience be A sign of Treason; they are Traytors all: But surely this self-bridling Treachery Doth more for thanks and praise, than anger call. O never be it said, that you alone Could in arm'd meekness read Rebellion. 68 Though Heav'n's Angelic Army rangéd stand In fair array, their martial order does Not tempt their Sovereign's wise thoughts to brand Them with the odious character of Foes. Let then, that Copy, justify their fact, Who arméd are to Bear, and not to Act. 69 Else their full Torrent hither flowéd had, And made a Deluge of what's now a Drop. What shift could your craft's or strength's banks have made So fierce a Tide of Violence to stop? But now their Faith and Truth their Power aw, And only Duty is their martial Law. 70 For they by me their Homage send, and pray Your Highness would with it their Suit embrace; Changing their tedious Nights into their Day, Their only Day which riseth from your face; And deigning to go forth and see how they Their panting souls, before your feet will lay. 71 Here breaking off in deep deceitful sighs, With cunning tears she all her face bedew'd. But toss'd and rack'd in ambiguities, Ten thousand several thoughts poor Psyche chew'd: Weeping at length, O that those Tears of thine, She cry'd, were as sincere and true as mine! 72 If those Dissemblers now would Suters be, What mean proud Arms and warlike Preparation? Petitions sure should from the bended knee, Not from the Bow be shot: this sullen fashion Stout Rogues brought up, who begging with one hand, A stone bear in the other to command. 73 In front why is that burly Stranger set As General against your Sovereign? He whose heav'n-daring Looks proclaim him fit Not to request and sue, but to disdain. If I were longer to be trusted, why Chose you his Banner for security? 74 Yet that the Progress of your Treason may Want all pretence, as its Commencement did; I'l condescend to hear you say your say, Provided you yourselves in quiet spread Before my window: I must parley there; You know how you have us'd my messenger. 75 Love stung by that last Word, and with fresh tears Dissembling their true cause, took humble leave. Then to her Complices the News she bears, Who it with doubtful countenance receive; And boulting every Circumstance, conclude That still the same Device must be pursu'd. 76 Agenor strait vouchaf'd himself to shew In all his pomp, and more than was his own; That Psyche might those vast Temptations view Which only swell'd so high to throw Her down. But none of all the Passions knew from whence He beck'ned, in his strange Magnificence. 77 The glorious furniture's full flowing Stream Follow'd his nod with like facility; As in a dreaming brain light figures swim Into a Sudden Masque of Bravery. The Sight the Passions struck with joyful fear, And made ev'n Thelema with reverence stare. 78 Yet crafty He, though glad and proud to read Their admiration of his gorgeous Ly; Told them they wrong'd his Honor, if they did Count this poor flash, his total Majesty. Which said, his Train he to the Castle drew, And there preparéd for the Interview. 79 At length six golden Trumpets' mouths affirm'd Their Master's Highness was at hand to treat. To her balcony Psyche thus alarm'd, Started; and found the Noise was not so great As strange the Sight: She never, though a Queen, Such prodigality of State had seen. 80 An half-ope Tent appear'd, whose Covering was Sumptuously rugged with Embroidery Of Pearls and Jewels; in which various Glass, Titan, who needs would peep, had lost his Eye: But yet ten thousand He receiv'd for one; For every Gem return'd him back a Sun. 81 A fearful Texture of fierce Tapestry Pavèd the awful Floor with costly pride; Where slaughter'd Lyons, Boars, and Bears did lie; Confessing by whose martial Hand they dy'd: For every one had great Agenor's dart Deep sticking in his head, or in his heart. 82 The Walls hung thick with War; the noblest stories Whose valiant Actors e'r had honor'd Bays; Were glistering there, not in unworthy glories: What Gold, and richer Stones could do to raise Them to their life again, being freely tried; Whilst Art as liberally her wealth supplied. 83 Th'obedient Sun rein'd in his posting Hours On heav'n's steep side, at Joshua's strict Command; Where to attend and to admire his Powers, This glorious Witness with fix'd Eye did stand. The Moon pull'd in her horns, nor daréd they Push forth the Night, till He had got the Day. 84 Close by, five Kings all prostrate gnaw'd the ground, Feeling his Captain's feet upon their necks: And in a stately-miserable Round Were rangéd other Princes, twenty six; Whose Crowns lay all before his Helmet broke; Whose loppéd Sceptres ru'd his faulchion's stroke. 85 There boistrous Samson with his Asse's Jaw, (A wretched weapon could his Sinews not Mend his weak Tool by his most potent Blow,) A thousand Enemies devouréd: But With statelier Might, his brawny shoulders here Did Gaza's gates up Hebron mountain wear. 86 And yet his last Exploit crown'd all the rest, When to the Prince's fatal Sport he shew'd; Turning their Banquet to their funeral Feast, When with their Wine their blood and brains he brew'd. As down he tears the mighty Theatre, The Hangings full of their own ruins were. 87 Next him, a young and ruddy Champion flings Into Goliah's brow a shameful Death. There Terror's train vast Ishbibenob brings Upon the Scene, shaking with monstrous wrath His barbarous spear; till Abishai's brave Steel Hew'd down this Mount,—whose fall forc'd Gath to reel. 88 There Sibbechai on Saph's enormous Pride Stout vengeance takes. There mighty Elhanan Drowns storming Lahmi in his own blood's tide. And there th'undaunted Blade of Jonathan Prunes the sixfinger'd Gyant; and requites The bold defiance he on Israel spites. 89 An army to himself, Adino there Musters his Powers against eight hundred foes: Glad this great harvest he alone may share, About his daring work the Champion goes; Nor stops his conquest till he quite has mown This total field of matchless Honor down. 90 There Dodo's Son; there Shammah keep their ground, Nor yield one inch to all Philistia's host: The more shame spurr'd them on, the more they found They ventur'd only to their deadly cost; For obstinate Victory attended here On Shammah's Sword, on Eleazer's there. 91 Benaiah from th'Egyptian Heroe here Tears both his Spear and Life: He there divides Destruction twixt a Lyon-facéd Pair Of Moabites: His faulchion here he guides Into a real Lyon's heart, whose cave Where him he found, he left to be his grave. 92 To Bethlehem there the danger-scorning Three Through all Philistia's guards slash ope their way; Fir'd with a stronger thirst of Victory, Then was their King's of Water: Of their Prey They scorn'd to fail, although they through a flood, —Advancing and retreating,—wade of blood. 93 The other Work, the vaunting stories wore Of what He pleas'd about himself to lie: How many Gyants gasping in their gore Yielded Agenor, strange-form'd Victory! How many Palms and Bays about him threw Themselves, ambitious of his Hand and Brow. 94 What throngs of meek Ambassadors were there From every quarter of the awéd Earth, Begging the favor of his royal ear Upon their Sutes for Peace; and pouring forth The richest Gifts their Countries could afford In earnest of their homage to their Lord! 95 Above his Scutcheon hung, In Azure field A Lyon Or, with lightning in his paw; The crest was Fame, with cheeks and trumpet swell'd And wings display'd. His throne of Pearl below With sparkling earnestness strove to exceed The beams of those six Steps which to it led. 96 The first was Plutus, of substantial price; The next Eugenia, in fancy high; Callos the third, the ravisher of eyes; The fourth Andria, swell'd with majesty; The fift Pædia, quainter than the rest; Eusebia the sixt, of all the best. 97 There sate the Gallant: one whole Diamond made His radiant Helmet; and in wanton pride A gorgeous flood of Plumes about it play'd, Yet scorn'd the kiss of any Wind; aside They wav'd their heads and coyly seem'd to say, To every Blast: Your breath offends; away. 98 A stately Mantle's large expansion reach'd Down from his wide-spread shoulders to his feet; And cloth'd him with all splendors that are fetch'd, From eastern shores, the western Pearls to meet; And by a rich conspiracy of beams Epitomize the World's estate of Gems. 99 His Sword look'd lightning through its crystal sheath, Whose round Hilt crownéd its victorious Blade: His mighty Sceptre, circled with a Wreath Of bloody Bays, right dreadfully he sway'd. The Ball in's hand was swell'd to that degree As if it meant indeed the World to be. 100 At's right hand stood Disdain: turn'd was her Head Over her shoulder; with contemptuous Eye Through gloomy frowns, her sullen mind she spread, And seeing, scorn'd to see, the Company: Nor did she mend or mollify her brow, But when her Master's growing rough, she saw. 101 At's left stood spruce and gaudy Philauty, Whose thoughts dwelt on a crystal book she held Eternally, to her admiring Eye; In which her foolish self she read, and smil'd On her fair Lesson; though the brittle Glass Admonish'd her how vain her Beauty was. 102 Before Him, on a golden pillar,—at Whose massy foot a Palm and Laurel grew,— Upon the back of Triumph, Glory sate; From whose full robes more dazling Lustre flew Than breaks from Phœbus' furniture, when he Through Cancer rides, in June's high gallantry. 103 About him round his whole Retinue was Dispos'd in royal equipage: His own Attendants had the credit of the place Which glitter'd nearest his illustrious throne; Then with their cheated Leader Thelema Stood all the Passions in battalia. 104 Crafty Agenor having paus'd a while To give respect to his own state, and let Psyche have time to swallow down the guile Which with such winning baits he had beset; By soft and proud degrees vouchaf'd to stir, And being risen, thus accosted Her. 105 Did Pity's generous and Sovereign Law All specious points of Honor not forbid; Agenor must not have descended now To stand at Psyche's gate; but I am led Below myself by Virtue, that my Might May help these wrongéd Passions to their Right. 106 'Tis Fortune's pleasure that thus casts me, on These merciful Designs, and I'm content; Fame, fame's my Trade: this noble Pay alone My Pains expect: Indeed the common Rent By which my most renownéd self I keep Are those Revenues, I from Glory reap. 107 And since these silly Souls mistook my Worth, And deem'd me but some single errant Knight; I let this glimpse of what I am break forth, To teach their Error my authentic might Needs no supplies from them: This Part of my Ne'r-conquer'd Train dares Heav'n and Earth defy. 108 How easily this Sword's devouring flame Might Sacrifice you to my Wrath! but you Being a Female Thing, I hold it shame To make my Conquest's Honor stoop so low: I'm loth the World should say, Agenor drew His Sword, and, like a Man, a Woman slew. 109 In Woman's blood my Weapon never yet Blush'd for its base Exploit; nor will it now By sordid Victory discredit get Unless inforc'd by fortune, fate, and you. And then I hope the justice of the Fight Will cover that dishonor of my Might. 110 But I through Courtesy myself forget In lavishing thus far my royal breath: Precious are Princes' Words; nor is it fit Their Tongue should flow, whose nod or finger hath More decent Eloquence. Thus having spoken, He took his throne, and nodded Love her token. 111 She knew her cue, and stepping gently forth Thus 'gan her Tale: Great Queen, since I must be My suppliant Sister's mouth; o may this Earth Ope her's to close up mine, if falsity Break from my lips, or any fraud conceal What they, and truth, and justice bid me tell. 112 What Heav'n has made us, 'tis our bliss to be, And that's your Subjects: though cross Error now A confident blot throws on our Loyalty; The least of treacherous thoughts we disavow. What should the fond boughs gain, should they combine Their desperate arms their root to undermine? 113 Yet your wise Majesty full well doth know That as yourself a free Prince are, so we Are freeborn Subjects: Nature's Laws allow In our sweet Commonwealth no Tyranny: She knew this mutual Liberty would bless Both Prince and People, with joint happiness. 114 When did a Realm of slaves unto their Prince The trusty sweetness of Love's homage pay? When did a Tyrant with safe confidence Rely upon his Vassals? None but they Can fairly Rule, and fairly Ruléd be, Whom freedom's bonds ty up in Monarchy. 115 But what broad Innovations of late Rush'd in, and justled out our Liberty, O that we could not feel! Had it been fate Which thrust on us this boistrous Misery, We had been silent: but we know what Hands Have stol'n our freedom, and by whose commands. 116 Nor I, nor any of my Sisters were Suffer'd ourselves in quiet to possess: We might not Love, nor Hate, nor Hope, nor Fear, We might not taste Revenge or Joyfulness, Or any thing which pleas'd not them who had A Prey of all our Privileges made. 117 Surely we all had legal Title to What ours by reverend Nature's bounty was; Yet snatch'd from thence, poor we were press'd to go And serve abroad we knew not where, alas! Nor e'r shall know; for how should we comprise Mysterious Things and Matters of the Skies! 118 Nor is this sad case only Ours, who are Inlanders here: Your Subjects too abroad, Who at your Cinque-ports with perpetual care In-gathering your royal customs stood, Are gall'd with like Oppressions: and they Pray'd us, with ours, their Grievance to display. 119 They have not leave, (poor leave) to hear, or see, Or smell, or taste, or feel, what is their own; But chain'd in deep unnatural slavery Of their starv'd lives and selves are weary grown: Yet more than all this Grief their hearts doth break, That Piety itself must prove their Rack. 120 They must a new Devotion learn, and be Tortur'd with Watchings, Prayers and Prostrations; With Ceremonies of pale sanctity, With Fastings and severe Mortifications: Or if this superstition they refuse Some mulct, the poor Confessors' backs must bruise. 121 Had they been temper'd to the purity Of brisk and active Angels, they might all Manage spiritual Tasks, and weanéd be From every gross Material Breast: but shall Matter's own off-spring be Delinquents made, Because in their own native sphere they trade? 122 And by what Law must honest They or We Under this Arbitrary power lie? Where is your freeborn Subjects' Liberty Who have no freedom left, unless to die? And surely Death a greater blessing were Than such a Life as we all die in here. 123 Mistake not, gracious Sovereign, what I speak, As if I charg'd the guilt of this our Wrong On your just Soul: No; let my heartstrings crack With their own torments' load, before my Tongue Grow black with such a slander: you, alas! Involved, a sufferer are in our sad case. 124 A sufferer in that which nearest lies And dearest unto every Prince's heart: Your royal Honor in our Miseries Is rack'd and tortur'd, and torn part from part. Ask not, by whom? 'tis too notorious what Bold Charmers in your Court command had got. 125 Logos, that wiley fox, screw'd all his skill Daily to make both you and us his prey: Some handsome Tale or other he would tell Which fairly might to your mistake betray Your unheard Subjects: from your highness thus He stole your ear, our Liberty from us. 126 His Majors, Minors, Maxims, Demonstrations, With most profound deceit he gravely drest; And by these sage and reverend Conjurations Pour'd Cruelty into your clement breast. His mischief-hatching Plots seem'd sober Reason, Which in the Passions must have gone for Treason. 127 Hence issu'd those Commands which day by day Illegal Burdens on our backs did throw; And to this sad necessity betray Our loth loth Souls, observing Gall to flow From Honey's hive: for though all warrants came From his fell hand, they wore your gentle Name. 128 Some woful comfort it had been if we Had to that single Tyranny been damn'd: But we at home in forein slavery Were yoak'd; A Grievance we would not have nam'd In reverence to your Credit, could the thing Have easy grown by our long suffering. 129 For what's that Charis unto us, that She In our Free State such arrogant sway must bear? Or what, and why are royal you, if we Must be commanded by a Foreigner? We grant she's brave and princely; yet we know We owe allegiance to no Queen but you. 130 She came from heav'n, if we her word may take; But what should woo her from so fair a place To dwell in this ignoble World, and make Her high self stoop to such profound Disgrace? I would be loth to wrong her; yet I fear There's something in't, why Heav'n gat rid of Her. 131 And was't a heav'nly trade which here she drove In plotting how to barbarize your breast With strange Austerity; and to remove Us from your love, with which we once were blest? Your smiles she all monopoliz'd, and left Us quite of all things but your Hate bereft. 132 Surely our Patience was our Crime, and she Only because we were content to bear, Increas'd the burden of our Misery: And then, to seal our Torture with a Jear, She prais'd our Woes' deep hell, as if by it In heav'n's high-way we had been fairly set. 133 If this Devotion be, and heav'nly Zeal, What, what is Savageness! Alas that we None but destructive Piety must feel, And by Religion consumed be! Alas that Heav'n and Godliness must thus Be mock'd and wrested and abus'd with us! 134 Nor has proud Phylax us'd less dangerous art To cozen you into this Tyranny: Soft are his Wings, but cruel is his heart; Sweets in his Looks, stings in his bosom lie; Fair do's he speak you, for that Bait's the cheapest; His Streams run smoothest where the Chanel's deepest. 135 Were you a youngling, and devoid of Friends Whose riper arms might help your tender hand To sway the Sceptre's load; what he pretends, With tolerable sense perhaps might stand: But must your Nonage know no bounds, and He For evermore the Lord Protector be? 136 Now by your Honor, mighty Queen, 'tis time For you no more to think yourself a Child. Know, know your own authentic Power, and Him Who has your Love and it too long beguil'd: 'Tis no discredit for a Prince to throw Away an Error, and with it a Foe. 137 Your Confidence in Him, which flames so high, Was kindled by his service in the Grove. Yet what if that were but a Mystery Of envious fraud, and no Exploit of Love? If Phylax, and not Aphrodisius were In all that scene of Charms the Conjurer? 138 Who but the noble Aphrodisius there His own dear life right generously forgot, And from fierce Death wide-gaping in the Boar Rescu'd your helpless soul? And O, from what Did Phylax snatch you, but from his Embrace Who your Deliverer and Lover was. 139 And then inrag'd with shameless spight to see You to another your protection owe, He on the courteous stranger's Piety Blush'd not the dregs of magic Power to throw: How much more Monster was your Phylax there, Who made the goodly Knight so soul appear. 140 Long since we could have told you this; but we Dar'd not ev'n necessary Truth profess Till Arms had sheltred us; least cruel he Should both our tongues and lives by force suppress: For well he knows, he must no more be known Where once he's into open knowledge grown. 141 Yet we could brook it, would he only try His charms on Aphrodisius, and forbear To exercise on us his Witchery: But we alas so metamorphos'd are With that rough-cast of shapes he on us cleaves, That you in your own Subjects he deceives. 142 We too like Fiends (for Rebels sure are so) Presented are to your abuséd eye: Although ev'n Phylax in his heart doth know Our Lives are not so dear as Loyalty To honest-meaning us: And whose was this Desp'rate Enchantment, if it were not His? 143 'Tis true, he talks of Love; and needs will be The Paranymphus of the heavenly Spouse: But surely I should ken as well as he All Mysteries of Love: your Highness knows That my Creation only aims at this: And is my natural Art less mine than His? 144 That Love's own glorious Prince makes love to you, As to the dearest she that treads his earth; I dare not question, since so well I know Your Majestie's incomparable worth. But heav'n forbid that I should Him esteem So strange a Spouse as Phylax makes of Him. 145 Sure he is King of Sweetness and Delight, And with more zeal abhors all Tyranny Than Phylax loves it: Sure His gentle Might Desires a correspondent victory. Not all the world shall make me think that He Will ever woo his Spouse by Cruelty. 146 Lents, Embers, Vigils, Groans, Humicubations; Tears, Pensiveness, disconsolate Privacy; Sad silence, Sourness, and self-abnegations; Are not conditions requiréd by An earthly suiter; and can heav'nly He Imbitter thus his suit's dear suavity? 147 Can he expect his tender Spouse should prove Her loyalty to pant with pure affection, By nothing but Self-hatred? Can his Love Find no security but your destruction? Pardon my fear, great Queen, you love not him Whom such a spightful Lover you can deem. 148 But far be such black omens hence: Had I, Or this wide world, one Glass, which could present Your total Self to your considering eye; The gallant sight would make your heart repent This dangerous heresy, that Heav'n's gentle King Would use so harshly such a lovely Thing. 149 What was there of Serene, of Bright, of Sweet, Of Soft, of Beauteous, in this world below, Or that above; which did escape the great Creator's studious fingers, when on you Himself he wrote, and bad your Person be The Universe's rich Epitome? 150 But Phylax brews this cruel-flattering Plot, Because it is his rack, and hell, to see Fortune or Fate so rare a Bride allot To any Spouse but him: Hence, hence is he So subtly active in his secret Art How he may you and your great Suiter part. 151 Part you he will, if he can thus intice Your thoughts and judgment to be Traytors, and Charm you your Lord's affections to despise By scorning Us; who, had not his dear Hand Bestow'd Us on you, had not now liv'd here This Mass of cruel Injuries to bear. 152 O then, O, first for your own royal sake, And next for ours, wrapp'd up in you, beware Of his Designs in time: Just courage take, In what deserves your speediest, stoutest care. Nor you nor we can be secure, till he Both from your Court and Favor banish'd be. 153 Nor can your Palace be a dwelling-place For Safety, whilst pragmatic Logos, or Sly Charis revel in your Princely Grace. One Edict may dispatch them all, and far From this their stage of holy treachery Pack their incurable Hypocrisy. 154 So shall your Sovereign Self securely dwell, And your impartial undeceivéd Hand Sway its own Sceptre: So shall we dispel By low obedience to your high Command That groundless Error, which hath stampéd thus Rebellion's ugly brand on faithful Us. 155 So shall our rescu'd Liberties appear In their own looks, when We by love shall do More of your Will than disingenuous fear And lawless Tyranny e'r hal'd us to. So you for Rigor shall not dreaded be, But reign acknowledg'd Queen of Clemency. 156 So shall your sweetned Countenance proclaim That Love's dear trade sincerely you profess: So shall your eyes court with their answering flame Your Spouse's beams; so shall His tenderness Meet due capacity in your soft heart Of his destroying, yet enlivening Dart. 157 Here, with a kiss upon the ground, her stop The crafty Pleader made. But thousand Doubts Hurry'd and toss'd uncertain Psyche up From one side to another of her thoughts. Three times she op'd her mouth; but jealous fears Would suffer her to speak by nought but tears. 158 'Tis true, Syneidesis had prick'd her on With faithful importunity; yet still She found her feeble self too much alone; For though she had Desires, she had no Will. O no! her Will was with the Rebels, and She now in arms against her self did stand. 159 Which when Agenor spy'd, he with his eye Gave Thelema commission to succeed. She, marching forth in portly policy, Spun out the rest of Love's deceitful thread: And, Well I know, great Queen, said she, that you Much wonder I should come a Treater now. 160 I grant you sent me with express Command To force your seeming Rebels back again, And make them feel that your illustrious Hand Is moderatrix of the regal Rein: And I believéd them for Rebels too; So much your Error on my faith could do. 161 But when I found their Loyalty as clear As blurr'd it seem'd, in Misconstruction's glass; I, who was but th'intrusted Officer Of Right and Justice, had no power to pass My strict Commission; and what need I prove What was so solidly confirm'd by Love? 162 I must confess, when well I mark'd that store Of honest bravery of which poor They Were, with the Senses robb'd, I could no more To their provok'd Impatience Treason lay, Than to the Earth's, when her chink'd mouth she opes At Sirius, who burns up her flowry hopes. 163 Yet wronged They were generous, and to Me The choice of all their choicest Wealth did proffer, That by my hand it might commended be To wait on you; and here their Gift I offer. If it and them you scorn, yet must not I Be guilty of such proud Discourtesy. 164 Forthwith she op'd the Scene, whence streaméd out The Confluence of that gorgeous fallacy. Which on her heedless soul before had wrought. Strait, as the sweetly-rolling Tide grew high, The stream bore Psyche down; as sudden Light Seizeth, by too much day, the eyes with night. 165 Agenor, glad to see her dazell'd by The flash of those varieties, arose; And, while she rubb'd and questionéd her eye, Seald that Imposture with this specious Close: Wonder not Madam, but repent, that you Your Subject's goodly Homage scorn'd till now. 166 To gratify the Weakness of your sex, Let that be your excuse; I am content If now you ease your galléd Subjects' necks And crown their just Demands with your Assent. That Pity to their Wrongs you see me lend, To your repented Error shall extend. 167 The love which to mine own Queen glues my heart, Makes it to every other Lady kind. For her dear sake I will to you impart Rich Testimonies of my tender mind. I know she'l thank me when I come at home, That in my mercy I have made you room. 168 Behold my Mine of Wealth: from hence will I This Peace with precious Tokens consecrate, And your, howe'r unequal, Majesty As my Confederate own: Though potent fate Makes me a Martial Prince, I'd rather win By sweetness, than by churlish Force, a Queen. 169 Though Heav'n above sometimes by Thunder frights And breaks its foes; yet by mild Patience And bounteous favors oftner it delights The heart of Opposition to convince. And, for this once, I hope 'twill not disgrace My might, that I Heav'n's gentle Conquests trace. 170 Ope then your Gates: Or, if my Kindness be A price too mean to buy your Acceptation, Tell me but so: I can more easily Force than Intreat: This warlike Preparation With greater pains wins on it self to make This pause, than it will cost your Fort to take. 171 What help for Psyche now, whom Power hurries, And Charms allure into Destruction's pit! With heart-misgiving Thoughts a while she worries And struggles not to fear the one, nor yet Imbrace the other: but away at last Her Resolution and her self she cast. 172 Pull down thy foolish crest, vain Son of Dust, And in this Glass thy feeble Wormship see. What other pledge can to thy wavering trust Committed be, when by self-treachery Thou yieldest up thy wretched heart a prize To them whose Pow'r in thy Concession lies. 173 I like the Terms, right noble Sir, she cries, And in my high esteem for ever must Inshrine and reverence these Courtesies Of your Magnificence. Which said, in haste Her Safety she unbars, and to begin Her thanks, flings ope her Gate and calls Him in. 174 Agenor sheath'd his mighty Sword, and bid The Passions put up theirs, and march before. In modest order they thus enteréd: He with his swelling Train approach'd the Door; But seem'd to cast a surly look aside, Because it was not more sublime and wide. 175 With princely slowness thus arrivéd; Her He sternly wills her royal Seal to put To those Conditions which agreéd were, And in a gilded parchment ready writ. She ran them over with a smiling eye, And strait set Seal to her own Slavery. 176 Which done; To Thelema the Instrument She gave, with full Commission close to shut Her Ports, when Charis, or when Phylax bent Their marches, or their projects thither. But For Logos, she consented He should still Remain a Pris'ner at the Passions' will. 177 With that, Agenor cries, this friendly Kiss Shall be my Seal to this Pacification. The Passions then, though venturing not to press Her lips, salute her ears with Acclamation: And she, fond she, rejoyc'd their Noise to hear, Which did in pieces all her freedom tear. 178 By name she kindly welcom'd them; but on Agenor dwelt her solemne Complement. And sure, said she, what you to day have done Proves you to be of that sublime Descent From which my Spouse was said alone to spring; For now I see you too are Peace's King. 179 Heav'n was too large and loose a Word, when you Profest to trace its gentle Conquests; He He only was your glorious Copy now, Who is the Master of my heart and me: He who deserveth to be follow'd by Such royal Scholars as your Majesty. 180 His Hand's Power's highest throne; the Armory Of heav'n, where thundering Ammunition lies In dreadful store, is His; yet tender He By sweetness loves to gain his victories. And so do you, who for his sake, to me The noblest Prince and dearest are, but He. 181 Agenor smil'd: and who I am, said He, Virtue permits me not to let you know: More than by this blest Peace, and, what you see, That Token of my princely love to you: For, somewhere else the World may need, and I Must not by loitering here, my help deny. 182 Yet if my Aid you should hereafter want, Send and enquire at any Prince's Court. Those are the Hosts and Inns to which I grant The favour of my always-begg'd Resort: Where, from my Coming and Departing they Reckon the Morn and Evening of their Joy. 183 This said, and tendring, in two Cabinets His present, from her lips he took his leave; Through which he breath'd and kiss'd in new Deceits, Which her unwary heart did not perceive; Sly Spirits of Self-love, and foolish Pride, And many mystic swelling things beside. 184 With earnest Courtesy she woo'd his stay; But now his deep Design was compass'd, He With all his proud Retinue hastes away, And leaves her more a Pris'ner, than when she Was in her castle barréd up by fear Of them, who now all play the Tyrants there. 185 Each Passion takes her swindge, and makes appeal To Thelema when any Doubts arise; Boldly provoking to the Scroll and Seal, Which did this publick Freedom authorize. Thus Noise and Tumult all the Palace fills, Which now with lawful lawless Revels swells. 186 So when fond Phæbus, doting on his Son Resign'd his Reins into his childish hand; Quite cross the road th'impatient Coursers ran, And neither kept their way, nor his Command, But in unbridled madness with their wheels Drew on the World's confusion at their heels. 187 The Senses too, first Sticklers in the Treason, Reapéd of its licentious fruit their share; Perceiving quickly, that imprison'd Reason Must his stern Discipline malgre forbear: And proudly smiling, what tame fools were we, They cry'd, who did no sooner mutiny! 188 What strange and hideous monsters Kingdoms grow, Where Law and Sovereignty, the life and health Of every heav'n-descended State must bow To vile plebeians' wills! What Commonwealth Can justify its Name, where Subjects may Command, and Princes dare not but obey! 189 Where Freedom's Name being thus deflowréd, must Turn Licence's bold bawd, and make it free Only to be outrageous and injust! Where Desolation's Dame, foul Ataxy, As beauteous Mother of establish'd Bliss And public Happiness, admiréd is. 190 No Hydra's shape so shapeless is as this Which throws the world back to its breeding Heap; The hideous Chaos of Preposterousness That tumbles all Things in one monstrous Deep, And, envying the fairly-form'd Creation Disjoints and scatters it quite out of fashion. 191 Yet retchless Psyche is content to see This horrid Solæcism in her own breast; And thinks her Sceptre and her self more free Then when Obedience did her Subjects cast Low at the feet of all her Mandates, and Her Empire's helm knew none but her own hand. 192 The silly Rose delighteth thus to be Drest in her fairest looks and best attire, When round about a churlish company Of Thorns against her tenderness conspire: That dangerous siege of pikes with smiles she greets, Ne'r dreaming they design to choke her sweets. 193 Psyche's as jolly, as the Passions wild, And longs her joys with that rich Feast to feed With which Agenor's Cabinets were filld: Proud Expectation prompts her there to read The lines of Fate against her self, for she In opening them, broach'd her own Mysery. 194 (With such unfortunate Curiosity The fair-fac'd Box rash Epimetheus op'd: The trembling Lid forewarn'd his hand to be Better advis'd; yet still the Fondling hop'd For mighty Matters; but the Prize he found, Himself, and all the world in sorrows drown'd.) 195 The first was stuff'd with Bracelets, Networks, Tires, Rings, Ear-rings, Tablets, Wimples, Hoods, Vails, Laces, Lawns, Crisping-pins, Chains, Bonnets, golden Wires, Vermilion, Pencils, Smiles, Youth, blooming Faces, Gloves, Sandals, Girdles, Busks, Gowns, Mantles, Clokes, New-fashions, Powders, Coronets, High-looks. 196 Silks, Satins, Purples, Sables, Ermins: Gold And Silver, by the Loom and Needle taught, To wed and dwell with Silk, which feels no cold. The bottom too was sumptuously fraught With ready Coin, to pave and dress the floor Fit for the feet of that ambitious Store. 197 A stately Mirror's all-enameld Case The second was; No crystal ever yet Smil'd with such pureness: Never Ladie's Glass Its owner flatter'd with so smooth a cheat. Nor could Narcissus' fount with such delight Into his fair Destruction Him invite. 198 For He in that, and Self-love, being drown'd, Agenor from him pluck'd his doting Eyes; And shuffled in her fragments; having found Old Jezabel's, he stole the Dog's due prize. Goliah's staring Bacins too he got, Which he with Pharaoh's all together put. 199 But not content with these; from Phaeton, From Joab, Icarus, Nebuchadnezzer, From Philip and his world-devouring Son, From Scylla, Catiline, Tully, Pompey, Cesar, From Herod, Cleopatra, and Sejanus, From Agrippina and Domitianus, 200 And many surly Stoics, their's he pull'd; Whose proudest Humors, having drainéd out, He blended in a large and polish'd mould; Which up he fill'd, with what from heav'n he brought In Extract of those Looks of Lucifer In which against his God he breathéd war. 201 Then to the North, that glassy Kingdom, where Establish'd Frost and Ice for ever reign; He sped his course, and meeting Boreas there, Pray'd him this liquid mixture to restrain. When lo, as Boreas op'd his mouth, and blew For his Command, the Slime all solid grew. 202 Thus was the Mirror forgéd, and contain'd The vigor of those self-admiring Eyes Agenor's witchcraft into it had strain'd: A dangerous juncture of proud fallacies; Whose fair looks so inamored Him, that He Thrice having kiss'd it, nam'd it Philauty. 203 Inchanted Psyche ravish'd was to see The Glass her self upon her self reflect With trebled Majesty. The Sun when He Is by Aurora's roseal fingers deckt, Views not his repercusséd self so fair Upon the Eastern Main, as she did here. 204 New flames were kindled in her sprightful eye, New Roses on her smiling lips were strow'd, New Loves and Graces dainty Luxury Down with her golden streaming Tresses flow'd, New Lilies trim'd her hands' and fingers' feature, New Goodliness aggrandizéd her stature. 205 Her cheated Soul sprung through her Eye, and dwelt So long upon the Glass, that it grew new: Such mighty thoughts till now she never felt As all about his highswol'n fancy flew; Which breaking from her mouth, at length, she cries, How long have I been strange to mine own eyes! 206 Am I that Worm, whom Phylax put in mind So oft of Dust and Vileness! Could this face, These Eyes, these Looks, these Hands, this Person find No better Parallels? I see the case Is plain how Aphrodisius came to be So hideous: Phylax made the like of Me. 207 Fool that I was to dream it could be true Which proud He daily preach'd to my disgrace! Who could believe I ne'r till now should view The wonders of mine own accomplish'd face? O most ingenuous Glass, which tells me more Than Phylax, or than Charis did before! 208 I see what cause there was to guard each Port Whose key doth hither any way unlock, That such ingrateful envious Guests' resort No more may Me, and all my favors mock: 'Tis just that they should hence exiléd be, Whose spightful Fraud did banish Me from Me. 209 No marvel now if Heav'n's apparent Heir Disdains all Beauties that he finds above, And, doing right to what's supremely fair, By stooping down to me exalts his Love. I little thought I could so much have shown Why this my Head should fit an heav'nly Crown. 210 O pardon me, bright Eyes, that ignorant I With briny tears so oft have sully'd you: Had not your Flames by their Divinity Securéd been, they had been quench'd e'r now. And pardon me, sweet Cheeks! I will no more Blubber and scald your roses as before. 211 And you, all-lovely Lips, no more shall kiss The Dust, which foolish I took for your Mother; The tribe of oriental Rubies is Your precious Kindred: nor must any other Your soft and living Nectar hope to sip, But my Dear Spouse's correspondent Lip. 212 Nor shall rude usage rob thee of thy due, My glorious Body: all hair-clothes farewel, My liberal Tresses yield me hair enough; And by this Girdle, Heav'n did plainly tell What other Furniture would sute me best, When with this siege of Gems it girt my waste. 213 And since thy Casket's Wardrobe challenges My proudest choice, I wish thy self wert here, Royal Agenor, to admire how these Fair Limbs of mine would quit themselves, and wear In worthy triumph thy best Jewels, which Shall by my purer beams their own enrich. 214 This said; Love, who stood fawning by her side, Her delicate Quaintness sets on work to dress Her high-conceited Queen in equal pride. A purple Mantle, fring'd with Stateliness, Embroideréd with Ambition, lacéd round With Vanity, she in the Casket found. 215 About her this she plants: then for her neck And wrists, three gaudy strings of Gems she chose; A sparkling Coronet her head to deck; To trim her feet a pair of silver shoes; A crisping Pin to multiply her hair; Spruce Lawn to make her breast, though clothéd, bare. 216 Whilst she with these, and other Rarities Builds up her pomp; the swelling Queen delights To see by what rich steps her Beauties rise: For to the Glass, whose multiplying sleights Flatter'd her Error to so proud a pitch, Her joyous folly still her eyes did reach. 217 And, that Vermilion, you, said she, may spare, Whose pretty Looks it pities me to see; Which though they Beautie's pure complexion wear, Can add no commendation to Me. They may relieve your needy Cheeks: but mine Already any help of Art outshine. 218 Then rising in slow state, as she before Had mark'd Agenor moving from his throne; She traverséd, but scorn'd to see, the floor, Or any of the Passions who look'd on. Only she turnéd her vain-glorious Head Back to the Glass her walking self to read. 219 Which Lesson pleas'd her pride so well, that she Gat it by heart, and yet must read again; Insatiably coveting to see The Pomp in which her Looks and Clothes did reign: And, tickled with her self, she wish'd that now Her Spouse a Visit would on her bestow. 220 The cunning Passions seeing her inhance Her gate and aspect, thought it fit to bow, And at the feet of her new Arrogance Themselves and their insidious homage throw: Which though she likéd, yet she sleighted too, And taught Acceptance with Disdain to go. 221 But judging now her Home too narrow to Contain her Greatness, she abroad must ride, That unto hers all Eyes might reverence do Who now could prove her self Heav'n's worthy Bride; And justly might display her beams in this Low world, as in the upper he did his. 222 An open Chariot she calls for; and That with due state and speed her wheels might run, Eight tall stout Passions, at her command Bow'd down their necks, and put the harness on; Being prickéd with as strong an itch to be Abroad, and trot about the world, as she. 223 When lo Syneidesis, who all this while Her Queen had in a silent corner watch'd, Accosts her in an unexpected stile: For, strict hold on her shoulder having catch'd, What means this haste? here is another Glass, Said she, for you to view before you pass. 224 Behold these Eyes of mine; a Mirror where Lurks no Deceit, nor Charm, nor flattery: True Psyche you are here, and only here In this Reflection of Verity. I never yet abuséd You: and why Must that false Glass be trusted, and not I? 225 With indignation Psyche turn'd her head, And left scorn for Syneidesis; but she Who knew not to be daunted, followéd Her eye with loyal importunity, And made her see, in spight of her Disdain, That Conscience never shews her face in vain. 226 The Passions wonder'd at her boldness: but She is a Witch, impatient Psyche cries, And all inchantment's powers and tricks are met In those broad Mirrors of her monstrous eyes; Which so environ mine, that there's no gap Where from their conjuring Circles I may scape. 227 Behold how gross a Ly of Ugliness They on my face have threapéd, to outface The truth of all those beauteous lines which dress My royal Looks with prince-becoming grace. Surely myself I would upon myself Revenge, were I indeed so foul an Elf. 228 Was eye e'r frighted with so dire an heap Of angry blisters as those Starers make O'r all my skin! I challenge any Deep On whose wide face the Winds most freedom take, To shew so many billows, as in me: O no! as in this lying shape, you see. 229 Improvident Witch, why didst thou not as well Enchant my Touch, as thou hast charm'd mine eyes? Why didst thou leave these fingers power to feel The horrid Author of these forgeries? Their tumors are not yet so sore, but still Thy witchery they can restrain, and will. 230 Upon her throat forthwith her left hand flew, With furious vengeance having arm'd her right; With which upon the Maiden's eyes she threw The vehemence of her inflaméd spight. Hoping to break her Glasses, that their crack Might let those blisters out they seem'd to make. 231 But stout Syneidesis composéd was Of Metal as secure and brave as she: Her eyes, though clothéd in the looks of Glass, Yet borrow'd nothing but its Purity: Had they been brittle too, they had been broke, But now they bore, and smiléd at the stroak. 232 This fetch'd a secret sigh from Psyche, who Call'd for a vail as thick and black as night; And this at least, said she, the deed shall do, And bury those bold Monsters from my sight. Then on the Virgin's face she cast it, and Fast ty'd it on with an hard-hearted hand. 233 O miserable Privilege, that Man Should able be to muffle up that light Which shews him to himself, and only can Through rocks and shelves point out his Course aright! Unhappy strength! what Weakness is so weak, As those mad Powers which their own ruin seek! 234 But thus the frantic crazy-brainéd Wight Whom deep Distempers make his own Disease, Preposterously tries his wretched might Upon his Physic; and although he sees The Potion mixéd for his health, alas Throws that, and this both in his Doctor's face. 235 Proud of this self-confounding Conquest, to Her chariot Psyche hasts; whose Coursers from Her scornful eyes their own inflam'd, and through The air with haughty fervor flung their foam. With bended necks and sparkling looks they ran, Disdaining all the ground they trode upon. 236 Thus swimming over hills, and dales, and plains, She spy'd at length a simple Ermite's Cell; And plucking in her fierce Teem's looser reins, To see what Worm in that poor hole did dwell; An hoary homespun Man she there descry'd Deeply about his Roots and Herbs imploy'd. 237 To whom she cries, Ah fondly-wretched Thing, Is this a time for thee to cultivate? What makes thy Winter in the work of Spring, Who art already bowing to thy fate? Ev'n delve no more for Roots; that labor save; And for thy other foot go dig thy grave. 238 The sober Ermite having wisely view'd Her scornful Pity, thus replyéd: I For your Commiseration would have su'd, Had I these Pains accounted misery. But I can spare you all your pomp and ease; Whom poverty and labor better please. 239 A Coach (my moving House, my Home abroad) Once waited on my Idleness; but now I am content with Nature's comelier mode: That stately Shift (which vainly tickles you) Of borrowing legs of Beasts, to me is grown Needless, who have far nobler of mine own. 240 These Vanities, and all the rest, which are Superfluous Wealth's care-breeding Train, I threw Away with it; and that in time, for fear 'Twould so have servéd me; for well I knew That Riches were but glorious vexations; Sin's catching fuel, Plunder's Invitations. 241 Then took I sanctuary in that Cell, Which has more room to spare for Heav'n and God, Than my vast Palace; which was throngéd full With secular burly Things. In this abode I find my Heav'n, where undisturbéd I Far from the World's loud storms at anchor lie. 242 This spot of ground, the Scoff of your high eyes, By pleasant Pains I make restore to me What heedless Sloth had lost,—sweet Paradise. No Bait smiles here on a forbidden Tree; Nor in these Herbs doth any Serpent Sneak, Them to invenom, or my Safety check. 243 My serious Labor, and my rigid fare, Fright hence those tender Sons of Luxury Distempers and Diseases; guests which are Fed at the board of Superfluity. In health and vigor I can night and day Trade with my Maker, and both watch and pray. 244 He, though no wanton Bathes have softenéd My careless skin (which tann'd and rough you see,) Though all my weeds be of a rural thread Spun by neglect, and by Simplicity; Esteems not me nor my Condition poor, Who build my Hopes upon His only store. 245 His royal store, which (since this World below Could not contain't,) fills Heav'n's vast Treasury: And till Dust's Sons by Humbleness can grow As high as that, in vain they strive to be True Riches' heirs. But there's a way by which We Dwarfs, to that sublimity may reach. 246 A strange cross Way, which by Descension's wings Learns us to soar: For Grace such strength as this Into the field no less than Nature brings, With opposite Cures encountring Maladies. Pride threw us down when we were perch'd too high; Our ladder to get up's Humility. 247 Humility, that Art ennobled by His own profession whom the Heav'ns adore. Himself he made the Lowest of Most High, And of the Richest, most despis'dly Poor: By his own Pattern teaching us that we Shall surest by Rebound exalted be. 248 With Coach and Horses never any yet But great Elias unto heav'n was born; He, who on foot march'd through the lowest pit Of Poverty, of Peril, and of Scorn; And they who to this honor would aspire Must be such Heroes as can ride in fire. 249 Psyche with great contention deign'd to hear Him hitherto; but could endure no more. What pity 'tis, said she, that though thy bear Thus long hath waited for thee at thy door, Th'art grown no wiser yet! this sign doth shew Thy Dotage is past help: poor Wretch, adieu. 250 Then with relaxéd rein admonishing Her smoking steeds; they snatch'd her coach away, With sparkling foaming fervor, copying Her hasty Indignation; till they Drew near a goodly City: where their pace They chang'd, and stalkéd in with princely grace. 251 The gazing People stopp'd, as on she past, And fill'd the street with Wonder; every Eye Full in her way its foolish homage cast; And by admiring, higher rais'd her high And tumid Looks; who had the more to scorn, The more Spectators did her way adorn. 252 For whilst some prais'd the Coach, and some the steeds, And all her Person who their worth inhanc'd; With careless looks Contempt about she spreads: For though she lov'd whate'r her pomp advanc'd, Yet lov'd she too in public to despise What in her private thoughts was her best prize. 253 So when a burly Tempest rolls his pride About the world, though mighty Cedars bow, Though Seas give way to his far vaster Tide, Though Mountains lay their proudest heads full low Before his feet; he counts that homage vain, And rusheth on in blustring disdain, 254 On many Palaces her eye she cast, Which yet could not vouchafe to view them long: At last abhorring all she saw, she prest With insolent fierceness through the staring Throng, Crying: These Cottages can yield no room For Psyche's entertainment; I must home. CANTO VI. The Humiliation. The Argument. Her heav'nly Friends by Soul-subduing art Recover Psyche from her shameful Glory: And sure to seal upon her softned heart Religious Meekness, Phylax tells the story How Heav'n and Earth came Heav'n and Earth to be; And what vile Stain blurr'd her Nativity. 1 But what is Home to most unhappy Her, Whose only Castle is surrender'd to A Pack of Rebels, who resolvéd are To use the licence of their Conquest so, That She shall in her own Dominion Retain no power but to be Undone? 2 She might have safelier call'd all Tempests in, And to the loudest Winds flung ope her Gate; Or giv'n her key to Bears and Tigers, than To those more dangerous Beasts, whose fair-tongu'd hate Works by this strange Prerogative, that they By Honey Poison, by Embraces slay. 3 Give me a Foe (if needs I one must have) Who owns his Malice, and does fairly draw In open field, not blushing to be brave In his bold shame: One who's content to show The worst he means, and dares Professor be Of Wickednesse's Ingenuity. 4 Flat Enemies are honest courteous Things, Because they tell us what we have to fear: But double-hearted Friends, whose Blandishings Tickle our ears, and sting our bosoms, are Those dangerous Sirens whose smug maiden face Is ugly mortal Treason's burnish'd Glass. 5 These are the Pits, whose mouths with flowers spread Sweetly invite our feet into a fall; The golden Cups, whose lips are sugaréd To their dissembled Poison ours to call: The crafty Hooks, which in a dainty Bait To catch the liquorish Palate lie in wait. 6 The flattering Pipes, whose sweetly-thrilling Tune Inchants the silly Birds into the Net: The fairly-treacherous Beds of fragrant June With smiling Roses and with Lilies set: Where, th'unsuspecting Gardner to surprize By fatal sleight, perdue the Serpent lies. 7 The dangerous Dalilahs, whose weeping eye, Whose sighs, whose kisses, whose embraces be The truer Withs, and Ropes, and Web, whereby They bind the stoutest Samsons on their knee; Where, while they dream of Rest, they polléd are At once both of their Liberty and Hair. 8 The politicly-mild Hyænas, who Make Savageness in human accents speak, Whilst with such sweet hypocrisy they woo The heedless Swain compassion to take; That to his Foe his door he openeth, And in fond pity letteth in his death. 9 The fair-tongu'd Judases, whose lips can drop The honey of a friendly Salutation, And with soft kisses seal the bargain up; Though in their hearts a spightful conjuration Rankles, and swells, and labors how it may In looks and words of Love their God betray. 10 And surely Psyche by this Treason had Been cheated of her Life and Self, if He Who in his Judas, tryal of it made; Had lent no Pity to her Misery: Had Jesu's tender Goodness not outrode Her whose proud Coach now roll'd her from her God. 11 Had He not found a way to make her see The blindness of her own bewitchéd eyes; To weigh how real was her Vanity; To read the truth of all Agenor's Lys; To learn in time, that War and Desolation Lay breeding on her false Pacification. 12 Charis and Phylax He a while withdrew, That being left to her sole self she might Of her own weakness take convincing view, When bold Temptations challeng'd her to fight. But now he sends them back to help her down From that high Ruin where he saw her thrown. 13 Make haste, said He, my Love and her Distress Call for your speed: To you full power I give, To ease her of her wretched Mightiness Before it split her heart; to undeceive Her blinded Soul, and shrink it till it be Little enough to fit my Heav'n and Me. 14 (And well, O well it was, that gracious He Gave them such full Commission; else had they In vain unsheath'd their best Activity Her ugly-tumid bulk to cut away. Those who Pride's stubborn Castle down would bring, Must be impowr'd by Lowlinesse's King.) 15 They having thrice his foot-stool kissèd, flew On flaming Zeal's stout wings through every sphear: No Lightning's flash e'r made more haste to view The East and West at once, than this swift Pair, To reach their Errands but; or with more light Did all Spectators' startled eyes affright. 16 For when the Passions saw them darting near, Immediate Terror on their Souls did seize: Down fell their changéd looks and necks; tho' Fear Was left at home, she present seem'd in these. The sudden stroke on Psyche too did beat, And damp'd her Chariots, and her stomack's heat. 17 But though the first assault of Lightning be Pointed with Dread and Aure; the next are wont To march in more abated Majesty, And their bright Terror by degrees to blunt. Custom, though young and breeding, yet can make, The dint and edge of any strangeness slake. 18 Her daring Steeds adventur'd to recover Some sense and spirits of their boiling Pride As soon's that splendor's first Attempt was over: But she her self by Confidence's tide Stoutly presum'd to trust, that she might well The torrent of those heav'nly Beams repel. 19 This made her to her radiant Friends dispense Her frowns and lowring-loathing looks, and by That silent language of Impatience Her changéd mind and sullen thoughts descry: But when she mark'd them still resolv'd, she cries, I thought you would have understood mine eyes. 20 If I must them interpret; Know, you are As much mistaken now in Psyche, as She was in you; I must, and therefore dare, Tell you your own: your treacherous Counsel has Too long bewitch'd my tender credulous heart: Henceforth you may for evermore depart. 21 The saucy Courser's ears all prick'd up high, Caught that proud Answer as from Her it flew; Which, neighing in tumultuous jollity With broad defiance lustily they threw Full in the faces of the heav'nly Pair; And then they kick'd and flung and snuff'd the air. 22 But Phylax pitching in her coach's way Lift up his hand and wing and forc'd her back; Crying much louder than her steeds could neigh: Yet e'r you go, vouchsafe to hear me speak; What tho' I be your Foe? you need not fear Now you have learnéd that, my words to hear. 23 Whate'r I say, I can no longer cheat you Whose Jealousy against me keeps a guard: But if with wholesom Counsel now I greet you, My Salutation must not be debarr'd Of civil entertainment: Foes may meet; Nor always is't in vain that met they treat. 24 This netled Thelema, who Postillion was, And had inflam'd the Coursers all the way: For shooting scorn from her bent brows, Alas She cry'd, thinks Phylax I'l his rub obey, Who ride where e'r I list, and never meet With Mount, or World, which stops my horses' feet? 25 Which said, she check'd her fiery Courser, (and This Anger was, the most outragious steed;) She with curvets strait answeréd her hand, And aim'd to snatch her way o'r Phylax head. Three times she leap'd, as often tumbling back, Till with her bones she heard the Chariot crack. 26 For Phylax' thether having reach'd a Ray Of mystic pow'r, attact the Axel-tree; Which with a splitting shriek gave woful way, And by the voice of its fragility Admonish'd all the Coach, that Ruin now Ment there to ride, and Psyche out would throw. 27 And true the warning was: the Wheels, the Team, The Barrs, the Pillars, Seat, Sides, Back and Head Shatter'd, and made Confusion's dismal game; Strait felt how sure the Axel prefacéd To their strange Tragedy, who now no more Could own their several Names as heretofore. 28 'Twas all but one rude Heap: upon whose back Lay Psyche bruiséd with the boistrous fall; But wounded more to see who made that Crack, And rais'd that Pile as for her Funeral. She scorn'd to take Him for an equal Foe, But swel'd and puff'd, and knew not what to do. 29 He in her sullen eye observing well Those troubled motions of her smoking heart, Which she could neither utter nor conceal; Pitied the sadness of her wilful smart: And, for compliance, her own course he took, Speaking not by his mouth, but by his Look. 30 This is the Dialect of strongest Love, Which, when the fruitless Tongue hath said her Say, With soul-commanding pow'r doth plead, and prove; That purest Rhetoric reigns in eyes; that they Who to the bottom of the heart would speak, In Looking Lines must their Orations make. 31 His serious Aspect upon Her was bent Compos'd of gentle wrath and mild disdain. Expressive were the Glances which he sent, And every Word that darted forth was plain. Some Rays grew hot, and stoutly chode, but others With melting Pity mollify'd their brothers. 32 O what a long long story ran he over In this short ocular Discourse! how fast Did he her bosom and his own discover, And what of old, and what of late had past; And what was dawning, if she still rush'd on With obstinate confidence to be undone. 33 But ireful She deign'd not to understand This Language, since the Speaker she despis'd: She proudly look'd, and coily wav'd her hand, And told him by those signs she was advis'd So well of what she did, that He might go And somewhere else his scornéd pain bestow. 34 So when the faithful Tutor's tender eye Reads his stern Lecture of Admonishment: His stubborn Pupil ventures to defy With disrespectful Looks the sweet intent Of those smart Memorandums, and by mute Disdain kicks back what Words could not confute. 35 Mean while as Thelema, tumbled from her Steed, Lay biting both the ground and her own lip; Charis her sweetest Pow'rs had musteréd From her worse precipice to help her up: And see, said she, when it was grown so tall How suddenly your Pride has caught a fall. 36 Yet this is not the bottom, but a step To that sad Ruin whether you did ride, O had you known how black and vast a Deep Gapes in your journy's end, all Deaths beside You would have woo'd and huggéd, rather than Have posted thus to plunge into that one. 37 Here with her potent Wand she stroke the Earth: Which knock when Tellus heard, she op'd, her door; When lo a Night of smoke came stinking forth, And then a dusky day of fire: the Roar Of that great Crack made surly Thelema start, And terribly reach'd Psyche's vexéd heart. 38 Yet though Dread shook their Souls, they deeméd it Shame to confess their fear and run away: Their adamantine Stomachs would not let Their lives be longer precious: still they stay, Not out of curious Desire to see, But to outface the hideous Prodigy. 39 The monstrous Jaws of that wide-gaping Pit With baneful soot were linéd thick: from which Incenséd Sulphure flashing rage did spit; And Clouds of Grones array'd in horrid pitch Breath'd sad confession who below did dwell: These proofs authentic were to speak it Hell. 40 Plung'd in the gloomy Cavern's centre were A wofull Rout chain'd up in fire and death; Abiram, Corah, Dathan, friéd there, With Peleth's venturous Son, whose traiterous Wrath Kindled that old Combustion, which now Concluded is in their own flames below. 41 Their howling Wives, and shrieking Children lay Broiling about them; and desir'd in vain One drop of water, after dying, they Had burnt so long in their still-living pain. Thick flow'd their tears, but mockéd them the more, And only scalt their cheeks which flam'd before. 42 As Thelema's thoughts chew'd these Soul-piercing sights, Behold this last Preferment,—Charis cry'd,— To which Ambition desperate fools invites: Say, is 't not pity that thou didst not ride Thy Journey out; And am not I thy foe Who down this fair Hill would not let thee go? 43 Behold how glorious a Realm of Bliss It is, to which thou bend'st thy fierce carrier: A Realm, wherein all bitterest Excess Grief, Anguish, Howlings, Tortures reigning are: Where every Ejulation, every Pain Alas, is too too truly Soverain. 44 Seest thou that arrogant Brood of Rebels, who Too lofty grown to stoop to heav'nly Law; Basely abus'd their Pride, and blush'd not to Their vile and earthly Passions to bow. Moses and Aaron, whom they kick'd at there, Are but your Phylax, and your Charis here. 45 Moses and Aaron there usurp'd too much, And bare their tyrannizing heads too high: And was not our Indictment only such When Love impeach'd us? Though we were not by Yet He was present then, whose Vengeance now Feeds on your proud Agenor's heart below. 46 Observe that Feind who holds fell Corah's chain, Himself bound in a greater: know'st thou why He gathers up his Tail's ashaméd train, And steals it round about his scaly thigh? Ask but his Looks, and they will tell thee plain What Spot it is whose guilt doth them ingrain. 47 This high-swoll'n Mountain of Deformity, Once vy'd with Beautie's self by borrow'd grace: But now uncaséd in his curséd sty, His shape is correspondent to his place: Here, here see what without a Ly is his; This Monster your admir'd Agenor is. 48 Hearing this word the tumid Spirit split His overchargéd mouth, and tumbled out A stream of brimstone, belching after it More horrid Cries; which bellowing about His hallow Home, and finding it too narrow, Into the Air let loose his thundering sorrow. 49 Earth's bones all shak'd as through her sides it broke; And startled Psyche felt her fears beat high. But Thelema disdain'd the Terrors' stroke, Confuting it with her all-daring eye: For well she knew her strength was Proof, and still Resolv'd whate'r it cost to have her Will. 50 Thus when a wilful Heir to age is come, And in his own hand feels the golden rain Of his long-wish'd Revenues; if by some Well-practis'd spend-thrift he be taught to drain His over-flowing Bags; in vain his friends Shew him what Ebb of want that Tide attends. 51 But trusty Charis still remembring what Her Master's love commanded, ply'd her part And since Fear's darts were thus repulséd, shot The shafts of Love into the Virgin's heart; Which in a diamond case from heav'n she brought, With many other precious Powers fraught. 52 Strong were the Blows, and op'd themselves the way Down to the bottom of their Mark, but yet Both sweet and silent. Thus the noble Ray Discharg'd from Titan's eye doth never hit The solid Crystal, but with dainty force Quite through and through it takes its harmless course. 53 On Thelema's Soul the gallant Arrows wrought With blesséd wounds of heav'n-begotten joy: Yet she with such perverse resistance fought, That had kind Charis, known how to be coy, Her scorn'd pains she had spar'd, and left the Maid By her own stubborn Victory betray'd. 54 But she as obstinate was in Patience, And many a dear time shot and shot again: Until th'importunate strokes awak'd a sense Of both delightful and convincing pain; With which pierc'd through, now I must, I see, Cry'd Thelema, by this Sweetness conquer'd be. 55 I know I need not yield, except I will; But this Soul-plying violence which now Severely sweet through all my wounds doth thrill, Inforceth me to force myself to bow: With that she louted low, and on her knee Beg'd pardon for her pertinacity. 56 O noble Virtue of Immortal Grace! How uncontrol'd is its mild mighty Art, Which can a Bosom of itself uncase And teach the Heart how to subdue the Heart; Which gains unbloody Bays and triumphs thus In delicately conquering Us by Us! 57 So when into the Swain's unwary foot The venemous earnest of a Swelling Death Is from the treacherous Tarantula shot; Music's sweet Accents wisely temper'd, breath A mystic Antidote, which by delight Deceives the Poison, charming out its spight. 58 Here Psyche, seeing Thelema relent, Knew her own stomach's power in vain would swell: Necessity convinc'd her to recant And find how lost a thing she was: Her fell And useless Arrogance away she threw, And after it, three sighs sad farewell blew. 59 That thus ejected; shame and Modesty Of their ingenious Home took fresh possession, And in her purple cheek and gloomy eye Displaid a scene of penitent Confession: Then, as her pride above her self had toss'd her, No less beneath these on the ground did cast her. 60 'Twas easier now for her to weep than speak: Yet striking stifly on her guilty breast A passage to her stifeling grief she broke, And wrought out this sad cry: O turn at least From shameful Psyche, turn your spotless eye; Leave me alone to perish where I lie. 61 Leave me alone, or kick me down into That mouth of Torment gaping for me there; That I may to my lov'd Agenor go Whose lies against your truths block'd up mine ear. Sure Corah and his damnéd Company Take not up all the room; there's some for me. 62 There must be some; else justice is not just: For what have they deservéd more than I! I would not thither go; and yet I must, Because till now I would. I would not die, And yet I dare not live; such deadly pain In this my life of shameful Guilt doth reign. 63 'Twas more then death to me to view the face Of my too-late-believ'd Syneidesis, When she presented in her trusty glass The faithful Copy of my Hideousness. What in your Lustre's dint then shall I do! No vail has night enough to smother you. 64 Ay me! that most calcining Purity Of your celestial Looks I cannot bear: Pride has so tainted my unhappy eye, That nothing more than purest sights I fear; For they my Torments are, and burn me so That to a cooler Hell I fain would go. 65 This woful out-cry grated Charis' heart Wont not to break but heal the bruséd reed: She knew what Lenitives would tame that smart, Yet gave no more than for the present need: Leaving the perfect cure a while; for she Perceiv'd how wholsome longer Grief would be. 66 Mean time the rampant Passions were stray'd And in wild madness rovéd all about: But Thelema, before by them betray'd, Reveng'd that treachery, and by a stout Command unto their duties warn'd them back: The whole field at the awful Voice did quake. 67 They started all, and strait of one another Ask'd mutual counsel with a doubting eye: But after that first Call out brake it's Brother, And thundered with Imperious Majesty. Forthwith they look'd, and spy'd their Mistress's hand High lifted up, which spake a third Command. 68 They knew these Summons' did in earnest call, And always had disdain'd to be deny'd: This forc'd their stiff unwilling crests to fall, And into slavish quaking turn'd their Pride; When angry Thelema snatching up the reins, Severely of their harness, made their chains. 69 So when the Master shakes his dreadful rod High in the view of his licentious Boies, Who rambling were and truanting abroad; Their loth adieu they bid to all their toies. And trembling into School expect when they The price of their Extravagance should pay. 70 This done, she stoutly lash'd her shivering Teem Close to the lip of that dread mouth of Hell; Where their late General she shew'd to them; Tearing his Feindship he could not conceal: Which Sight them and their treacherous Itching parted, And through their Souls immortal Terror darted. 71 Which Act perform'd; the Scene they all remove To Psyche's house; who now profoundly drown'd In her disconsolate self, no longer strove Against her Friends. No matter 'tis what ground Receives this wretched corps, said she, since I Have pass'd the worst of Death's extremity. 72 As thus She through the solitary field With doleful pace returnéd homeward, She The lately-scornéd Ermitage beheld With reverent blushing: but when pious He, Who reign'd King of himself and it, espy'd This blesséd Change, he sate him down and cry'd. 73 He cry'd for joy, and answer'd Psyche's tears Which multiply'd with every step she took; With noble Charis he had many years Been well acquainted; and in's heavenly Look, He read that Phylax was to him of kin, Who his own Guardian from his birth had been. 74 What They had done, his wisdom well could guess When he the stubborn Queen thus melted saw; Her frowns, her taunts, her coach, her stateliness Were vanish'd all, and she thrown down so low; That by Agenor's and Heaven's help she seems In one day to have reachéd both Extreams. 75 Full many a blessing did the good Man pour On Charis and on Phylax as they went: But panted out to his dear Master more Who them to that Exploit of Mercy sent. He threw good Wishes after Psyche too, Tracing her steps as far's his eye could go. 76 And when the Air's vast Sea had drown'd his eye, He launch'd fresh Prayers for her happy weal: Profoundly importuning Heav'n to tie The Booty fast it thus had snatch'd from Hell: To tie her fast to holy Meekness, that No swelling Pride might burst the blesséd knot. 77 Heroic Charity how soon dost thou Subdue all wrongs, Contempt can shoot at thee: And freely bless all Patrons which bestow Successe's boon on thy proud Enemy! Right noble is thy Valor, which alone Can make thy Foes' good fortune be thine own. 78 But they now to their journey's period come, Psyche with stiff sighs open blew the gate; And sadly viewing her abuséd Home, Thought every wall did chide for what of late She trespass'd there; and that at every groan The Echo cry'd, She had herself undone. 79 As loth she to her Chamber was to go As Thief into the cell, where he has hid His wicked goods: Yet they would have it so Who from self-theft had her deliveréd. But two deep Groans, as up the stairs they went Summon'd their eyes to search whence they were sent. 80 A slie Trapdoor they lurking there discover'd Keeping its counsel with bar, lock, and seal: Where whilst their wise consideration hover'd, Two other Groans did to their aid appeal: When Thelema convinc'd by shame and fear, Broke ope the door, to shew them who were there. 81 Deep was the Dungeon, and as dark as Night When neither Moon nor Stars befriend the skies: But Charis looking in, a morning light Upon that gloominess rose from her eyes: When lo, Syneidesis and Logos tied Fast in the bottom of the mire they spied. 82 So fast, that nothing but their Lamentations And sighs and tears had any room to stir: Yea these, alas, through long ingeminations; In languid weariness inchainéd were. Yet now this Spectacle's free Looks could cry, They strait found audience in Pity's eye. 83 Down Phylax flies, and hovering over them (For no dirt may deflower his virgin wings,) Unties their cords; and by their mantles' hem Up to the dungeon's mouth the Pris'ners brings. Full thick about them stuck the mire and clay, Yet Psyche thought herself more foul than they. 84 And falling on them with a show'r of tears, These soon may wash your filth away, said she; But my deep-grain'd Pollution out-dares The utmost purging power of Oceans: Ye Besmearéd are with none but others' spots; I blur'd all over am with mine own blots. 85 O add no stings to my deep Anguish, by Denying pardon of my mad Offence! Saw you but half the flames in which I fry, The sight would thaw your breasts, and kindle sense Of my sufficient woe—. But here between Her and her further Cries step'd Charis in: 86 Who hastned her into her Chamber: where No sooner entred, they the Mirror Spy, Which strait grew pale, and quak'd for guilty fear At that bright dawn of genuine Purity. Away thus Night's false Fires and Phantoms sneak When through the East the gallant Day doth break. 87 As Phylax to the Glass drew Psyche nigh, She quakéd more than that, and started back: When lo, said He, this Engine, fram'd to ly, Now of itself shall true confession make; Urge it but with the Touch of any Gem, Whose place is meanest in thy Girdle's hem. 88 Abaséd she, afraid of further shame, Waver'd a while in anxious suspense; Her jealous fond demurs still went and came, And fain she would have found Delay's pretence; Yet judg'd it best at length, not to withstand Her Guardian's however strange Command. 89 O glorious power of heav'nly Gifts! the Glass Remembred quickly its original eyes, And weep'd to see its stately-beautious face Dissolv'd by one short Touch: Its fallacies Melted amain, and on th'amazéd floor In floods of loathsome slime themselves did pour. 90 A slime which smelt so rank of death, that had Not Charis stood 'twixt Psyche and the Harm, T'had chok'd her heart: but Heav'n's assistance made Her spirits chear and kept her courage warm. Securéd thus; take these drops more, she cry'd, And on the slime thrice spitting, turn'd aside. 91 Then jealous of the other Cabinet, Look here dear Friends, said she, I needs must fear Some foul Enchantment hatcheth here its plot, And that these Treasures in false shapes appear: They are Agenor's gifts; how can his Pelf Be made of truer Beauties than himself? 92 You know your Touchstone, Phylax cryéd; let Your Girdle question't and it will confess. That Item she obey'd no sooner; but Forthwith her Touch was answer'd by an Hiss: Their heads the starting Bracelets having reard No Nest of Jewels but of Snakes appear'd, 93 Of younger Serpents an intangled fry Thick in the sprucer Networks twisted were; Who sham'd and vex'd by this discovery Wheted their peevish teeth, and try'd to tear Their textures' bands; but when they felt the bite Their own backs dig, they angry poison spit. 94 The Tires and Hoods shrunk into Horns; the Rings Dilated into Fetters; every Lace Like scorchéd Thongs, or singéd shrivel'd strings, Shew'd in what burning shop it woven was: The gaudy Bonnets and the dainty Vails Were nothing now but brass or iron scales. 95 The Crisping-pins return'd to Forks and Hooks, And Tongs, and Prongs; the Lawns to Dragons Wings; The golden Wires abjur'd their glorious looks, And provéd red hot Nails, or Darts, or Stings; The Busks, were Gaggs; the Gloves were fiery Claws; The Tablets, Boiles; the Sandals, Tigers' Paws. 96 The Pearls, were Coals; the Coronets, wreaths of Fire; The brisk Vermilion, was Gore or Ink; The Pencils, Rods of ever-burning Wire; The Powders, Brimstone; the Perfumes, a Stink; The smiles, dark frowns; the youth and blooming Cheeks, Dread-darting wrinkles, and stern Vulturs' Beaks. 97 The high-looks, deep dispairs and shames; the fashions, Sundry Inventions of most learnéd Spight, And never-dying Torture's Variations; The Silks and Satins, Coats of Aspes; the bright Purple, a Lion's or a Panther's Hide In innocent blood of slaughter'd Infants dy'd. 98 The Ermins and the Sables, were the Skins Which monstrous Cerberus casteth thrice a year; The rich Embroideries, Ranks and Files of Pins Pointed with steely Torment and Dispair; The Silver and the Gold that lay below, Old Rust and Cankers which themselves did knaw. 99 As when a fond Child wantonizing on The flowry Pillows of the Garden, and Feasting his heedless eyes and hands upon Soft Maia's Delicates, espies a band Of ireful Snakes rang'd in that field of Joy, On horror's head-long wheels he posts away: 100 So all these dreadful sights stroke Psyche through With full as many fears; and back she ran: But Phylax stopping her, demanded how She dar'd those Trappings trust, herself had on? They too are of the same foul breed, said he; And will you still with Hell arrayéd be? 101 With that, he snatchéd off that Tire which Pride On her abuséd body planted had: Which as his Indignation threw aside, The gaudy Ornaments confession made Of their hypocrisy; and laid their true And native horrid shapes in open view. 102 Poor Psyche seeing with what Monsters she Had trim'd without and pleaséd been within; Cry'd out, O wilfully deluded Me Who joyéd in my self-revenging sin! Rise rise, O righteous Wrath; help thou my fist (And here she stroke,) to pierce this treacherous breast. 103 A noble Stroke was this, and won its way, Its happy way, quite through her broken heart. Forthwith a cole-black stream, which swelling lay And belking there, took warning to depart: Out gush'd the Bane, and split the pois'ned floor, Hasting into its Hell to find a door. 104 Deliver'd of this monstrous Guest, the Wound Clos'd gently up, and further harm shut out. But she her sides so lank and hollow found, That for her self within her self she sought; And stood awhile amaz'd, as if the Stroke Had only some Dream's brittle Wonders broke. 105 Confounded then with pious shame, she to Her former Weeds turn'd her most piteous eye; Whose decent honest Looks rebuk'd her so That back again she stagger'd, stricken by Remembrance how she them disdain'd, which now Outshinéd all Agenor's cheating Show. 106 At length, in Sorrow's penitential voice Give leave, said she, my genuine Furniture That once again I make my prudent choice, Henceforth inalterably to indure. Or, if again I scorn your poverty, From Hell's foul Wardrobe may I clothéd be. 107 Come trusty Hairclothes, you did never yet Undress me of myself by garish Pride: Come hard, but honest Rope, thou ne'r would'st let Ambition blister me, but gird'st my side Close to my heart, and leftst no room between For puffing strutting Thoughts to harbor in. 108 So, now I'm dress'd indeed: how shamelesly Have I unclothéd wander'd up and down! No Nakedness in Heav'n's all-searching eye To that sin clothes us with; thus overgrown With Leprosy the Man more naked is Than when bare nothing but his skin was his. 109 No wonder that wise Ermite seeing me Mounted in Vanitie's enchanted state, So sadly pity'd my proud Bravery. Good Man, he soberly perceivéd what Neither my Eyes nor Glass would tell me; He Ev'n by my Robes my want of clothes did see. 110 Yet can it be, that jealous Heav'n, and you O my provokéd friends, should not be just! What Privilege shields rebellious me, that now Vengeance should sheath its daréd Lightning? must Your Patience from my Crime its copy write, That both may equally be Infinite! 111 It must, said Charis; and be sure to pay Thy Spouse due thanks for this Necessity. Yet if his favours still thou kickst away, Know, that this Soul is not so seal'd to Thee, But He can find out some more faithful Breast Which will not Love's dear Violence resist. 112 She thus reform'd into her lowly Tire, Their Convert, her celestial Friends embrace; Kissing into her Soul fresh joies of fire, And printing gracious Looks upon her face. Then sitting down, to what I now prepare To tell, said Phylax, lend thy heedful ear. 113 The story, Psyche, bends its aim at Thee; And fetch't I will from its deep bottom, that Thou may'st the long and total prospect see Of thine Extraction and original State. That sight wil teach thee that these simple Weeds Are full as fine and gorgeous as needs. 114 Nay more than so; when I withal have shown What peerless sovereign Powers flourish in Thy Spouse's Hand and Word; how far thine own Condition flags below his Worth; how mean A Match thou art for Him, who nothing hast In dowry, but vile Vanity and Dust. 115 ALL things at first was God, who dwelt alone In his unbounded self: but bounteous He Conceiv'd the form of this Creation That other things by Him might Happy be. A way to ease his streams his Goodness sought, And at the last into a World burst out. 116 Which World at first was but one single step From simple Nothing; yet that step was wide: No Power but His, or could, or yet can leap Over to Something's bank from Nothing's side. If you those Distances compare with this, The East and West are one, the Poles will Kiss. 117 This Something, Son of Nothing, in the gulf Of its own monstrous Darkness wallowing lay. And strangely lost in its confounded self Knew neither where to go, nor where to stay, Being hideously besieg'd on every side With Tohu's and with Bohu's boundless Tide. 118 The foulest Portents never frighted Day With such unshapen Shapes as strugled here; Whilst all the Heap, as if resolv'd to slay What scarce was born, broke into desperate War. No Hydra's heads so snarl'd at one another, As every Parcel rag'd against its brother. 119 The Deep climb'd up and tumbled down the Hight, And then again rush'd headlong after it. Brisk busy Lightness wroth with lazy Weight, Him from his sleepy groveling quarters beat. The rude tempestuous Windes blew all together, And fill'd the World at once with every Weather. 120 Scuffling for place, the Cold projected how, To frieze the Heat; the Heat the Cold to fry. The Centre fouly scorn'd to sneak below, And in Heav'n's face forc'd sluggish Earth to fly. Winter took heat, and stoutly found a way, To fling December through the heart of May. 121 All Qualities ran wildely up and down, Ne'r thinking of Symbolic amity. All Motions were transverse; as yet unknown Were Rest and Quiet; hideous Ataxy Was every thing: and neither Here nor There Keep'd their own homes, but All were every where. 122 No shores the Ocean in this Tempest knew, But swallow'd up the Sands; and rushing out, Whilst all things else were plung'd in quarrels, threw His billowy arms the Universe about; Which in this civil Deluge drown'd had been, Had not the kind Creator's help come in. 123 Forth flew th'Eternal Dove, and tenderly Over the flood's blind tumult hovering: The secret seeds of vital Energy Wak'd by the virtue of his fostering Wing: Much like the loving Hen, whose brooding care Doth hatch her eggs and life's warm way prepare. 124 When lo a Voice (that all-producing Word Whose Majesty both Heav'n and Earth adore) Broke from the Father's mouth, with joint accord Of th'Undivided Three; and deign'd to poure Itself upon the Deep, commanding Light To cheer that universal face of Night. 125 As when the gloomy Cloud in sunder parts, The nimble Lightning flasheth through the sky: So from this Mass of Darkness, thousand Darts Of orient beams shot their brisk selves, and by Obedient Splendor answer'd that great Call Which summon'd them to gild this groping Ball. 126 The Shades affrighted at the looks of Light To blind holes crept their shaméd heads to hide. God pitied them, and hastning on their flight, Safe lodging gave them in the World's back-side. There slept dull Night: but Day was brave and bold, And in the face of God display'd her gold. 127 Before the Sun was born, the Day was Day, Least his fair count'nance should the World intice Unlawful homage to his Beams to pay. Day's parentage is clear to pious eyes; Nor can she Daughter be to any other But Him, who is of Lights the sovereign Father. 128 The next Command call'd for the firmament To part the Waters which unruly grew. Strait in the midst of them a Bow was bent Of solid substance and of crystal hue. The purer streams had leave on Heav'n to flow, The gross sunk down and roaréd here below. 129 Which loud Impatience to restrain, their Lord The third day thrust them into prison; and To check their pride and fury, set a guard Of most invincible though feeble Sand: For in those bounds his Law ingravéd is, Which not the proudest Billow dares transgress. 130 Thus from this flood of deep oppression fre'd The joyful Earth made haste to wipe and dry Her blubber'd face; and raising up her head Admir'd to see her own Security. Then smiling at the welcome sight, her smiles Distinguishéd her face with Vales and Hills. 131 But being naked, and not knowing whence To cloth her self, God her appearel made. He spake; and lo a floury Confluence Her Plains and Dales with fragrant robes array'd. Trim'd were the heads of all her Hills with Tresses Of goodly Trees, and shrubby crispéd Dresses. 132 The fourth Day's work was spent on Heav'n; which yet Look'd like a virgin Scrol spread fair and wide; But with no characters of beauty writ Till God's great Word ingrav'd its radiant pride: But Titan then came sweetly-flaming forth, And all the World inamor'd at his birth. 133 Light, which till now had flitted here and there, Born on the back of an ignoble Cloud; No sooner spy'd his royal face appear, But in his bosom she desir'd to shroud: He courteous was, and to her wishéd throne Receiv'd her glorious ambition. 134 But being bounteous too, and marking how The bashful Sparks to beg ashaméd were; His lustre's flames abroad he freely threw. The Moon strait reach'd her horns, and caught her share; So did the Stars: and now all Heav'n grew fine Whilst He both in himself and them did shine. 135 The Hours flock'd to his foot, and louting low Su'd for a room in his bright Family: The like did cheerly Day, and made a vow With him to wake and sleep, to live and die. But conscious Night afray'd of his pure look, To spotted Luna her black self betook. 136 Then gorgeous Summer came, and spred his way With gales of gentle air and clouds of spice; Whilst jolly Flora in her best array Was prodigal of her Varieties. But plainer Winter reverent distance kept, And far behind his burning chariot crept. 137 The surly Sea the fift day awéd by Her Lord's express Command, reply'd with speed, And in most dutiful fertility Opened her mighty womb, whence issuéd The Wingéd Nations all Pair by Pair, The musical Inhabitants of Air. 138 The other german Brood, whose moister wings Abhor the drying Winds, she kept at home; Where through the Deeps they fly: born-unborn Things Which, though brought forth, live in their Mother's womb: A womb of Wonders, whose dimensions can Afford full flight to vast Leviathan. 139 Leviathan, whose smoking Nostrils blow Those seas of fire which from his stomack break: Whose dreadful sneesings by their flashes show The brazen scales which seal his sturdy back: Whose Beacon's flames out-face the Morning's eyes; Whose Heart in hardness with the Milstone vies. 140 Leviathan, who laughs at him that shakes The bugbear spear, and slings the idle stone: Who steely darts for wretched stubble takes; Firm Iron, for hollow feeble straw; who on The boiling Ocean wreaks his hotter wrath; Who where he goes, plows up his hoary path. 141 Who on his Neck no other collar wears But never-daunted Strength; who fatned by His diet of perpetual Triumphs, dares The challenges of all Dismays defy; And by his sprightful Looks commands the face Of frowning Grief to turn Joy's smiling Glass. 142 He at whose dismal generation Fear Fled far away, and nothing left behind But Scorn and Boldness; which compounded were Into the metal of the monster's Mind. Who mounted in his thoughts, doubts not to ride As Sovereign Prince of all the Sons of Pride. 143 But now the Sixt Day dawn'd: and Tellus is Commanded to bring forth her People too: She heard the Voice, and with strange activeness Made Beasts and Reptiles with her answer go; For startling up whilst yet their Mother's ear Rung with the sound, they cry'd Lo we are here. 144 Hast thou not seen the Princely Horse; whose eye With living Lightning's fed; whose portly neck Is cloth'd with mighty Thunder's Majesty; Whose glorious nostrils Terror's language speak; Who never would believe the Trumpet's sound, But with proud fierceness swallows up the ground; 145 Who with impatient heat the Vallies paws, When he hath smelt the battel from afar; Who mocks the sword, and brave defiance throws Upon the Quiver and the glittering spear; Who both the Trumpet's and the Soldier's shout With his more martial Ha ha doth flout. 146 Hast not Behemoth seen, that moving Mount Of flesh and bone, that Earth's Leviathan; Whose monstrous thirst, though many a living fount And River it hath slain, still trusts it can Down through the deeper chanel of his throat All Jordan (ev'n in time of harvest) shoot: 147 Whose Navel's Power's Knot; whose strong-built Loins The garrison of Might; whose massy Bones, Which grisselly steel fast to their sockets joins, Are brass, the less, the greater, iron ones; Who mounts his awful Tail so high, that he Seems like the Hill, that, like the Cedar tree. 148 These goodly Sons, with many thousands more, Were they which teeming Tellus then brought forth: But who shall now reign Sovereign Monarch o'r This and the Ocean's more numerous Birth? So great and weighty was this Business, that About it God himself in council sate. 149 A Place there is retiréd far and high Amidst the Tower of eternal Rest; Roof'd, pav'd, and walléd with Immensity Through which no Creature's boldness ever prest: In this, th'Almighty Three's joint Consultation Determin'd of the Work and of the Fashion. 150 Then stepping down to earth, this Triple One Moulds up the Dust which trembled at his feet; And ends his work as soon as 'twas begun: For now the quick shape rather seem'd to meet His Hand, than follow it, and every Part As wak'd by's touch, up from the Dust to start. 151 Forthwith about the Universe he reach'd His potent Arm, and cull'd from every thing, The choicest Excellence which had inrich'd Their several Tribes, to trim their breeding King; That they with willing hearts might Him obey In whom their own selected Treasures lay. 152 Fair was the Image; for its lines were true To that brave Form which Heav'n's eternal Son Had for himself design'd; that Form which drew His Hand to Frame this whole Creation. All things attend on this grand Mystery; The world was made that God a Man might be. 153 Yet still this hopful Model was no more Than, Statue-like; well lim'd but cold and dead: When lo th'Almighty's Breath vouchsaf'd to pour Life's flood into his Nostrils; whence it spred Through secret chanels into every Part, But chose its Mannor-house amidst the heart. 154 That Breath immortal was, as flowing from His bosom whom Eternity calls Sire: And kindled by its Blast that noble flame, Which shall out-live Heav'n's stoutest fairest Fire. 'Tis not the Crack and Ruin of the less Or greater World, that can the Soul suppress. 155 Thus Adam op'd his eyes; through which such beams Of Majesty look'd out, that gallant He Now by a new resemblance truly seems, The royal Image of his Lord to be: Heav'n's Sovereignty shines in God, and who But Man looks like the King of all below? 156 And yet those Looks of his had look'd in vain, If he had on his feeble self alone Founded his Title, and his Right to reign: The lofty structure of Dominion Requires a correspondent Base, nor must Such massy Buildings founded be on Dust. 157 But by his Maker's into his own hand Were put the Reins of Air, of Earth, of Sea: That under his imperial Command, All Fishes, Beasts and Birds might rangéd be: Which, though so boistrous now they seem and wild, Before their King at first were tame and mild. 158 This lower World's high Prince thus nobly made, God seeks a Palace where he might reside: And when the Earth his eye examin'd had, A dainty Place which in the East he spy'd His liking won; where he contriv'd the Seat Of his new Viceroy, delicate and great. 159 It was a Garden, if that Name can speak The worth of those illustrious Sweets, which there Conspir'd to prove that fancy a mistake, That Heaven dwells only in the starry sphere. The Earth look'd poor in all her other soil, Those Meanness serv'd but for this Jewel's foil. 160 No Weed presum'd to shew its roitish face On this fair Stage; the Nettles, Thistles, Brakes, Thorns, Bryars, Cockle, Hemlock, rampant Grass, With those dire Herbs the meagre Wizzard rakes Into his deadly boxes; either yet Were not at all, or far from Eden set. 161 The Yew, the Box, the Cypress, and all other Sad waiters on the Grave's solemnity Had there no business; Death, or Death's black Mother Not being yet conceiv'd: No crookback'd Tree, Disgrac'd the place, no foolish scrambling shrub, No wild and careless Bush, no clownish Stub. 162 Grim Winter and rude Boreas forbare To walk this way; so did Distempers, Cares, Perplexities, Sighs, Melancholy, Fear, Doubts, Jealousies, Seditions, Treasons, Wars, Storms, Thunders, Lightnings, Earthquakes, Ruptures, Streins, Wounds, Boils, Diseases, inward, outward Pains. 163 For on the Garden's margin ran a wall Built of Delight, and buttress'd with Content: Beauty stood at the gate, and let in all Who brought the Pass of fair Accomplishment; But if she spy'd a Wrinkle, Scar, or Blot, The inconsistent stranger out she shut. 164 Within rose Hills of Spice and Frankincence, Which smil'd upon the flowry Vales below; Where living Crystal found a sweet pretence With musical impatience to flow, And delicately chide the Gems beneath, Because no smoother they had pav'd its path. 165 The Nymphs which sported on this Current's side Were milky Thoughts, tralucid pure Desires, Soft Turtles' Kisses, Looks of virgin Brides, Sweet Coolness which nor needs nor feareth fires, Snowy Imbraces, cheerly-sober Eyes, Gentileness, Mildness, Ingenuities. 166 A goodly Army of peace-breathing Graces Were rang'd by these in Love's serene array; And in those multitudes of fragrant faces Sweet Order with Variety did play. Nor was it lawful One above the rest To magnify, for every one was best. 167 Stretch'd at full length upon th'Embroidery Of flowry beds lay Softness, Ease, and Pleasure: Whilst in the carpet walks there dancéd by Calmness, Longdays, Security, and Leisure; Accomplish'd Growth, brisk Firmitude, and Health; The only Jewel which makes wealthy Wealth. 168 Your Roses here would soon confess their Blush Due to their own Defects, should they compare With those brisk Eyes with which the Rosy Bush Looks up and views its beauteous Neighbours there: Nor are your Lilies white, if those were by Whose leaves lay ope the books of Purity. 169 Liban and Carmel bow their goodly heads To Paradise's foot: the Balm, Nard, Myrrh, And all the Spices of Arabia's Meads Freely acknowledge richer Sweetness here. Adonis Garden paralleld with this, No more a Garden but a Desert is. 170 The early Gales knockt gently at the door Of every Flower to bid the Odours wake; Which catching in their softest arms, they bore From bed to bed, and so return'd them back To their own Lodgings, doubled by the blisses They sip'd from their delicious brethren's kisses. 171 Upon the wings of those inamoring Breasts, Refreshment, Vigor, Nimbleness attended; Which wheresoe'r they flew, cheer'd up their paths, And with fresh Airs of life all things befriended: For Heav'n's sweet Spirit deign'd his breath to join And make the powers of these Blasts divine. 172 The goodly Trees' bent Arms, their nobler load Of Fruit with blest oppression overbore: That Orchard where the Dragon warder stood, For all its golden boughs, to this was poor; To this, in which the greater Serpent lay Though not to guard the Trees, but to betray. 173 Of Fortitude there, rose a stately Row, Here, of Munificence a thick set Grove; There, of wise Industry a Quickset grew, Here, flourishéd a dainty Cops of Love; There, sprang up pleasant Twigs of ready Wit, Here, larger Trees of Gravity were set. 174 Here, Temperance and widespred Justice there; Under whose sheltering shadow Piety, Devotion, Mildness, Friendship planted were; Next stood Renown with head exalted high; Then, twin'd together Plenty, Fatness, Peace. O blesséd Place, where grew such things as these! 175 Yet what are these, if Death's malignant hand May either them or their fruition blast? This to prevent, at careful Heav'n's command An hopeful Tree sprung up amidst the rest; Which nobly prov'd itself a Branch to be Pluck'd from the grand stock of Eternity. 176 Amidst them all it sprung; for well it knew Its proper seat, and chose the Garden's heart: No station but that to Life was due, Whence Vigor's streams might reach to every Part. Fresh Heat and Spirits hung about it thick, The boughs all breathéd and the fruit was quick. 177 By this th'alluring Tree of Knowledge stood (For where should Wisdom dwell but next the heart?) Whose leaves were written fair, but writ with Blood, And fill'd with Learning and capricious Art. O fatal Tree! how wise had Adam grown If he thy woful Knowledge had not known. 178 High in the shady Galleries sate a Quire Suting their noble Chapel; Birds of praise Whose lofty Pipes were tun'd by strong desire To pay for their sweet Home in sweeter Laies: With whom soft Echo, proud her skill to shew, Though slower time she kept, yet sung she true. 179 This Map of Wonders, this Epitomy Of Heav'n's best pride; this Court of Rarities, This Confluence of blesséd Gallantry; Was that so much renownéd Paradise: Renownéd yet how much sublimer than The loftiest praise it ever reap'd from Man! 180 For Man no sooner forfeited his Tenure In this Possession, but withal he lost All his Capacity to paint the honor Of his escheated Home: and now the most Which ev'n Poetic sprucest Pens can draw Doth more their own weak Art, than Eden show. 181 The great Creator hither Adam brings As to the Portal of celestial Bliss: And, see, said He, of these illustrious Things Free choise I give thee, bating only this One Tree of Knowledge: all the rest are thine; Eat what thou wilt; but still let that be mine. 182 If thy presumptious hand invades that Tree Thy licorish crime must cost thy life; and thou By Death's immediate tallons seizéd be: Death, Adam, Death hangs thick on every bough. What will that knowledge boot thy soul, whereby Thou nothing shalt be taught but Misery? 183 O noble Lord! who to his Creature gave A World at once, and yet requir'd of him No more but that he would have care to live, And long injoy the World's fair diadem; Who ties him to no homage, but to shun Being by his own fond needless fault undone. 184 Did he some hardy knotty Task propound Which must have daily swum in tedious sweat; His Vassal sure could no pretence have found To disobey, when hiréd by so great A price as All this All: yet bounteous He Will, like his Gift, have ev'n his servant free. 185 After this easy Charge; upon a Throne Built all of Power he his Lieutenant set, And at his high Inauguration His noblest Subjects orderéd to meet; Who now before his footstool marshall'd were In modest equipage all Pair by Pair. 186 Strait, as his awful Look their duty try'd; The Lyon couch'd, the Horse let fall his crest; Behemoth's tail forgot its mounting pride, And melted to the ground; the Bull deprest His horns; the Boar suck'd in his foam; the Bear, The Wolf, the Tigre, louted low for fear. 187 Like reverence humbled down the other Crew, Whilst from their Sovereign's fairly-dreadful face Such beams of full imperial Brightness flew As spake it plainly their Creator's Glass: Strong that Reflection was, which could command The rudest Beasts this Truth to understand. 188 As these admiring lay; the Eagle drew Up every rank and file of wingéd things: Thither the Estrich, Vulture, Falcon flew, Thither a flock of every Bird that sings; Thither the Peacock, but eclipséd so, That down fell all his Stars and trail'd below. 189 On came the most magnanimous strutting Cock Disdaining heav'n and earth, till drawing nigh His nobler Sovereign, his surly neck He felt arrested by Humility; His wings flag'd low, his fiery gullet grew Languid and pale, his comb and forehead blew. 190 Wise Adam mark'd them all, and sent his eye To search their bosoms' closets; where he read Th'essential lines profoundly gravéd by Judicious Nature, when she fashionéd Their Difference, their Kindred and Relations, Their Powers, their Properties and Inclinations. 191 Thus privy to their inmost selves, he sought What Titles would most clearly signify Their bosoms' hidden sence; and up he wrought In single Words each Nature's mystery. Acquaintance then he took of them by Name; And with a princely Nod dismisséd them. 192 But when their march in loving Pairs he view'd, A gentle sigh he fetch'd, to think that He Should spend his nobler life in solitude, Whilst all Things else injoy'd society. What boots it him to reign as sovereign Lord, If all his World can him no Queen afford. 193 If whilst each Bird and Beast hath leave to read His iterated self in his dear Mate, And by strait Love's prerogative can lead A double life in one: His sullen fate Imprisons him in his own breast alone: Alas! this thought heav'd up another Groan. 194 And heav'd it up so high, that to the ear Of God it reach'd; who calling Pity forth, Gave her an errand to the Deep to bear: Which nimble Nymph strait started through the earth Down to the silent mouth of that dark Cave Where Sorrows find their sink, and Cares their grave. 195 A lazy Moat the Grot incompasséd With waters which were never known to stir; Upon whose bank secure Oblivion's bed Was made of sluggish Moss and cakéd fur The Remoras and Crampfish groping lay About the bottom of the Mud and Clay. 196 Up from the Water crept an heavy Cloud Of dusky Vapours, on whose shoulders rid Fat Drowsines; who rub'd her eyes and bow'd Down to her bosom her unweildy head. Bats, Owles, and other purblind birds of night Stole through the swarthy shades their doubtful flight. 197 Mandrakes within the Moat, and Poppy grew, Which nodded to their neighbour clump of Trees: Those were the Willow, Cypress, Box, and Yew; Close at whose feet lay Quietness and Ease; And nestling by their side, an half-dead crow'd Of Dormise and of Bears, all snorting loud. 198 Through these pass'd Pity to a door of Jet, Whose wary ringle round was cloth'd in wool: The porter Silence, with his finger at His mouth; when by her looks he guess'd her full Of more than common business with his Queen, Softly stole ope the lock, and let her in. 199 There found she on a bed of ebony Sleep lay'd at length; her pillow, badgers' hair; Thick Night, full Peace, and soft Security Her rug, her counterpane, and blankets were. Close by her couch's side drop'd pipes of lead; A swarm of Bees were humming at the head. 200 But greater was the swarm of Dreams which walk'd In shapeless shapes about the throngéd room; Who though they laugh'd, and sung, and cry'd, and talk'd, No noise was heard in that confusion: some Wanted an head, a cheek, an eye, a nose, Some arms, some legs, some feet, and some their toes. 201 Some wanton seem'd, some chast, some spruce, some course; Some tame, some terrible, some black, some white; Some Men before, and yet behind a Horse; Some Swan on one side, on the other Kite; Some Love, some Hate, some Half-hope and Half-fear; Some heav'n, some hell, some both; most monsters were. 202 Indeed a few, who sleighted all the rest, Were lim'd and form'd by due Proportion's art; With sober gravity their looks were drest; Deep wonderous thoughts were hatching in their heart; Sharp was their sight, and further could descry Than any Eagle's Sun-affronting eye. 203 But now the Nymph aloud deliveréd Her earnest Message, jogging heavy Sleep. She shrug'd and yawn'd, and thrice lift up her head, And with one eye half ope began to peep: Then Pity to a Box she nodded, (for 'Twas death to speak) and so return'd to snore. 204 Black was the Box, and though its bulk was little, It seem'd the massy mansion-house of Weight. But Heav'n's stout Messenger was made of Metal So valiant, that she snatch'd it up, and strait On noble Fervor's wings devour'd the road To Eden, with her slender-mighty load. 205 Where she no sooner dawn'd in Adam's view, But he began to streak, and nod, and yawn; Forthwith the Nymph a sable powder threw Full in his eyes; by which quite overthrown, He lay supinely on a spicy bed Proud of the grace to kiss his sweeter head. 206 His sences thus seal'd up in dainty night, His Soul walk'd to his brain, to take a view Of that prophetick but obscure Delight Which in his fancies' fertile garden grew. When lo, a goodly Tree salutes his eye Tall, wide, and full of florid Majesty. 207 The Woods look'd all that way, and bow'd ther head; Low crept the shrubs and due obeysance made; The Plants and Flowers their fragrant duties did, Ambitious to be gilded by his shade. Thus happy he in glorie's zenith reigns King of the Hills, the Vales, the Woods, the Plains. 208 But from his own brave stock, out at his side A Twig sprung up, which grew as fair as he: As high it reach'd its head, its arms as wide, And flourishéd with equal gallantry. Their leaves all kiss'd, their arms embrac'd each other, They liv'd and lov'd and joy'd and reign'd together. 209 Yet soon their throne was undermin'd; for at Their heedless Root a desperate Canker grew; Which knaw'd with restless venom, till it got The day, and down their stately bodies threw. Amaz'd stood Nature at the sight, and all The World deep groanéd at their mighty fall. 210 As thus the royal Trunks in public view Exposéd lay, abandon'd and forlorn; From courteous Tellus they compassion drew, And sanctuary found from further scorn: For in her bosom's safe and silent bed Them and her Ruins up she coveréd. 211 The deepset Root still held its sturdy hold And kept its place: so did the Canker his. New Sprouts took heart, and followéd the old With answerable bulk and haughtiness: Whose fretful foe persisted still to knaw, And soon or late lay'd all their glory low. 212 Long held these Conflicts, till at length a Sprout Sprung from a new and unsuspected place; For on that side the indisposéd Root In all the World's opinion arid was. This only Branch scap'd being tainted by The inbred Canker's foul affinity. 213 Yet scap'd he not its restles envie's stroke, By which the Monster stoutly him assaild; Whom, when it shrinking saw and giving back, It impudently hop'd to have prevail'd: But he recoil'd, and was content to die, Only to gain the surer Victory. 214 For, wisely ordering his brave Ruin, He With his dead Weight full on his Enemy fell; Who crushéd under this calamity, Pay'd for his boldness and sunk down to hell. When lo, the conquer'd yet victorious Tree Started up into new life's bravery. 215 And after Him those other Trees arose Which dead had lain and rotten long before; For 'twas his pleasure to impart to those His own vivacious overflowing store. They every where leap'd up to life, and stood So thick, that all the plain became a Wood: 216 A royal wood of everlasting Trees Whose Arms all reach'd out vegetable gold; Whose dangling Gems sham'd India's Rarities; Whose towring Heads saw heav'n beneath them roll'd. Yet these were shrubs to that brave Cedar which Had rais'd them up to this triumphant pitch. 217 Whilst Adam fetter'd lay in senseless chains Viewing this wonderous Sight with musing thought; God op'd his side, but strictly charg'd the veins To seal their mouths, and let no drop peep out. From thence he chose a single Rib, and then The wicket clos'd, and all was whole again. 218 That Bone he handled with such breeding art That it dissolvéd into many more; And due materials for every part Most perfectly supply'd: what was before A single Rib, is now flesh, sinews, grissels, Blood, bones, skin, entrails, arteries and muscles. 219 And that the work might suit its beauteous shop In which no Creature forméd was but this; The willing Garden's Pride he pleas'd to crop, This Paradise of Paradise to dress. All Sweets and Delicacies flowéd hither, And in one Eve were moulded up together. 220 Eve, blesséd Eden's only native Queen; Eve, whose own Husband was her wond'rous Mother; Whose privilegéd Birth hath neither been Nor shall be copiéd by any other: Eve that fair Pipe through which Humanity Must into God himself conveyéd be. 221 Eve, Topstone of the goodly-fram'd Creation, The Bliss of Adam and the Crown of Nature; Eve, who enjoys the most removéd station From ugly Chaos; Eve that final Creature, In whom th'Almighty Lord set up his rest, And only spar'd to say He'd done his best. 222 Her spatious polish'd forehead was the fair And lovely Plain, where gentle Majesty Walk'd in delicious state: her temples clear Pomgranate fragments, which rejoyc'd to lie In dainty ambush, and peep through their cover Of amber-locks, whose volumes curléd over. 223 The fuller stream of her luxuriant Hair Pour'd down itself upon her ivory back: In which soft flood ten thousand Graces were Sporting and dallying with every Lock; The rival Winds for kisses fell to fight, And rais'd a ruffling tempest of Delight. 224 Two princely Arches of most equal measures Held up the Canopy above her eyes; And open'd to the heav'ns far richer Treasures, Than with their Stars or Sun e'r learn'd to rise: Those beams can ravish but the Bodie's sight, These dazel stoutest Souls with mystic light. 225 Two Garrisons were these of conquering Love, Two founts of Life, of Spirit, of Joy, of Grace; Two Easts in one fair Heav'ns no more above, But in the hemisphere of her own face; Two Thrones of Gallantry; two shops of miracles; Two shrines of Deities; two silent Oracles. 226 For silence here could eloquently plead; Here might the unseen Soul be clearly read; Though gentle Humours their mild mixture made, They prov'd a double Burning-glass; which shed Those living flames which with enlivening Darts Shoot deaths of love into Spectators' hearts. 227 'Twixt these an alabaster Promontory Slop'd gently down to part each Cheek from other; Where White and Red strove for the fairer glory, Blending in sweet confusion together. The Rose and Lily never joinéd were In so Divine a marriage as there. 228 Couchant upon these precious Cushonets Were thousand Beauties and as many Smiles; Chaste Blandishments, and modest cooling Heats, Harmless Temptations, and honest Guiles. For heav'n, though up betimes the Maid to deck, Ne'r made Aurora's cheeks so fair and sleek. 229 Inamoring Neatness, Softness, Pleasure, at Her gracious Mouth in full retinue stood: For, next the Eyes' bright Glass, the Soul at that Takes most delight to look and walk abroad. But at her lips two threds of scarlat lay, Or two warm Corrals, to adorn the way; 230 The precious Way, where by her breath and tongue Her Odours and her Honey travelléd; Which nicest Criticks would have judg'd among Arabian or Hyblæan mountains bred. Indeed the richer Araby in her Dear mouth, and sweeter Hybla dwelling were. 231 More gracefully its golden Chapiter No Column of white Marble e'r sustain'd; Than her round polish'd Neck supported her Illustrious head, which there in triumph reign'd. Yet neither would this Pillar hardness know, Nor suffer Cold to dwell amongst its Snow. 232 Her blesséd Bosom moderately rose With two soft Mounts of Lilies; whose fair top A pair of pritty sister Cherrys chose, And there their living Crimson lifted up. The milky count'nance of the Hills confest What kind of Springs within had made their nest. 233 So leggiadrous were her snowy Hands, That Pleasure mov'd as any finger stirr'd: Her virgin waxen Arms were precious Bands And chains of Love: Her waste itself did gird With its own graceful Slenderness, and ty Up Delicacy's best Epitomy. 234 Fair Politure walk'd all her body over, And Symmetry rejoyc'd in every Part; Soft and white Sweetness was her native Cover; From every Member Beauty shot a dart: From heav'n to earth, from head to foot I mean, No blemish could by Envy's self be seen. 235 This was the first-born Queen of Gallentry: All Gems compounded into one rich Stone, All sweets knit into one conspiracy, A constellation of all Stars in one; Who when she was presented to their view Both Paradise and Nature dazel'd grew. 236 Phœbus who rode in glorious Scorn's carreer About the world, no sooner spy'd her face, But fain he would have linger'd, from his sphere On this, though less yet sweeter, Heav'n, to gaze: Till shame inforc'd him to lash on again, And clearer wash him in the western Main. 237 The smiling Air was tickled with his high Prerogative of uncontrolléd Bliss; Imbracing with intirest liberty A Body soft and sweet and chaste as his. All odorous Gales that had but strength to stir Came flocking in to beg Perfumes of Her. 238 The Marygold her garish Love forgot, And turn'd her homage to these fairer Eyes; All flowers look'd up, and dutifully shot Their wonder hither, whence they saw arise Unparching courteous Lustre, which instead Of fire, soft joy's irradiations spred. 239 The sturdiest Trees affected by her dear Delightful presence could not choose but melt At their hard pith: whilst all the Birds whose clear Pipes tosséd Mirth about the branches, felt The influence of her looks; for having let, Their Song fell down, their Eyes on her they set. 240 And willingly their proudest plumes and wings Follow'd their Song: for in her Person they With fix'd intention read more glorious things Than all their gorgeous feathers could display, And were content no more the Name to wear Of Birds of Paradise, now she was there. 241 But when she mov'd her feet, the joyful Earth Greatfully rous'd her best fertility, And by a brisk extemporary birth Of Flowers and Spices, strove to testify What carpet's pomp was requisite to make The passage fit where Beauty was to walk. 242 She walk'd; by that mild importunity To break her sleep-inthralléd Spouse's chains: But he wak'd more by powerful Sympathy Which on the sudden glowéd in his veins, Drowsy no longer; thus the Steel, when near The Loadstone draws, leaps up to kiss his Dear. 243 And yet a while, (for spectacles which rush With unexpected glories on the sense, Forestall their own reception, and crush Beholders' faith by too much evidence) He thought his wond'rous Dream had still possest him, And with a gentler Apparition blest him. 244 But when his Eyes' discerning Test had try'd The graceful Object, and judiciously Pry'd into all the truth; he smiling cry'd, This nothing but my other self can be; The sweet Result of my own flesh and bone, And only Adam in reflection. 245 From me she sprung, and like a genuine sprout Answers the semblance of her native stock: Her breed proclaims her name, and issuing out Of Man she Woman is. Which said, he took Possession of her milky hand, and strait Sealéd upon her ruby lip his right. 246 What mighty Tides of flaming Loves and joys In their first marriage-greeting met together! And yet as pure and chaste, as when one Voice In musick's rites is wedded to another; Where with concentrick Delicacies they Hug and conspire in one soul-playing Lay. 247 He views himself more soft and sweet in Eve, Eve reads in Him her self more fixt and grave: Either from other's look themselves receive, As fast returning what they taking gave. Two streams thus meeting, find and loose each other I'th' kind pellucid bosom of his brother. 248 Nor did their amorous hands and lips alone In most unspotted Pleasure's juncture wed, But in a nearer dearer union Their Thoughts all kiss'd, their Hearts were marriéd; Their Souls so perfectly imbrac'd, that now This happy Couple was but One in Two. 249 A blessed Copy this, for those whoe'r To Wedlocke's bands themselves will captives yield: So shall their sweet Captivity appear No scene of slavery, but freedom's field; Where though they chainéd are, the whole World's gains Can never hire them not to love their chains. 250 They naked were, if flax, beasts' skins and hairs, And excrements, the sole Apparel be: But who will tax the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, The Diamond, Crystal, Coral, Ivory Of nakedness, because the cloths they wear None but their native beams and beauties are? 251 A Robe of Innocence and Purity From head to foot embrac'd them round about; Transmitting their pure features to the eye, But letting no unseemly shame peep out. They naked were of every borrow'd dress, And naked of what you count nakedness. 252 In this condition did they live and love, And by perpetual interchange of hearts Fairly transcribe our blesséd life above; Where through his eye his Soul each Angel darts Into his fellow's breast, that all may be In common blest by one felicity. 253 How great a Feast, and earnest invitation Was this for Envy; whose ambitious Taste Disdains all Fair but in the noblest fashion; Whose Jaws of greedy Iron stand agast At no encounter, but with restless spight Against the most confirméd Champions fight! 254 Her Palace seated in the heart of hell, Is built of Cankers, Rust, and Vipers' tongues; Her curséd Throne is mounted on the fell And boiling breast of Satan; which she stings With ever-fretful rage, and makes him run About the wild work of Damnation. 255 To Paradise he rush'd, and brought his Hell Into that earthly Heav'n, whose dwellers he With anxious eye survey'd and mark'd, until A Creature brisk and spruce he chanc'd to see Upon a bank of floury pleasures spred, But far more sweet and beauteous than its bed. 256 It was the Serpent, whose illustrious skin Play'd with the Sun and sent him back his beams With glorious use: that Wealth, which glisters in The proudest strand of oriental Streams, Salutes Aurora's cheek with fewer raies Than this bright robe did all heav'n's highnoon face. 257 His sharpset Eyes sparkled with nimble flames, The light by which his active Soul was read: Wisdom and Art, with all their plots and frames Chose their chief shop in his judicious head. Above his fellows on Craft's wings he flew; All Beasts but he to that dull Name were true. 258 This Agent Belzebub approv'd; and as He fed upon his couch, mix'd with his meat; Which ambush help'd him his Lips' guard to pass, Where (having taught his bane to relish sweet) He eas'ly won the Entry of his Throat, And down into his bosom's centre shot. 259 When subtile fire hath through the Cauldron's side Into its unsuspecting bowels stol'n; The liquar frets and fumes, and to a tide Of working Wrath and hot Impatience swol'n, With boiling surges beats the Brass, and leaves No way untry'd to vent its tortur'd Waves. 260 So now the Serpent felt his bosom swell With peevish rage and desperate disdain: A thousand Plots and Cheats throng'd every cell And busy corner of his belking brain: Sometimes he beats on that, sometimes on this, Sometimes thinks neither, sometimes both amiss. 261 He knew the vastnes of his fell Design; Which was, to slay a World at one dead stroke, And reach Destruction in a pois'ned line Down to the latest Twig of humane stock: And therefore muster'd up the boldest Might All Hell could send to back him in the fight. 262 But pondering then, how Adam's sober heart Was amply stor'd with Wisdom's ammunition, And strongly fortify'd in every part With sin-defying Grace; in deep suspition He shak'd his head, and thought the match not ev'n To venture on a fight with Him and Heav'n. 263 For if he hapned to be foild at first, His following onsets all would sweat in vain; And his own pois'nous spight his breast would burst To see both Adam and his Off-spring reign Victorious Kings of earthly Paradise, And flourish thence, to that above the skies. 264 Yet wholly to decline the Conflict, were To yield those Realms to Man without a blow; And in that foolish and ignoble fear Of, what's but Chance's frown, an Overthrow. To Resolution's brink this spur'd him on, Who could loose Nothing though he nothing won. 265 But in again his Cunning pressing here, Advis'd his Wrath to look before it leapt, And not neglect the Helps which offer'd were By fair Advantage: wherefore back he stept And marking Eve's soft Temper, thought that she Might less impregnable than Adam be. 266 Yet still he much suspected that the brave Refinéd Metal of her virtuous breast Would prove so generous, that to Deceive Would be an easier Task than to Contest: But could she any ways be overthrown, He hop'd her fall would justle Adam down. 267 The wary foe thus plants his Battery Against the Castle's female, weakest side; Judiciously hoping that if he Can there but make a breach, the fortify'd And well-mann'd Posts will soon appalléd be, And yield up all their strength for company. 268 Remembring then what Engine did subdue A wiser Head and stronger far than her, And how impatient Ambition threw From heavn's chief pinnacle grand Lucifer: He trusts that now the like successful End Might on this tryéd way of fight attend. 269 Incourag'd thus; the dangerous Quintessence Of venturous everswelling Philauty, Of Discontent, of Scorn, of Insolence, Of towring fancies, and self-flattery, And of the stoutest heav'n-aspiring Pride Together in one desperate Plot he ty'd. 270 And if this will not do the feat, yet I Excuséd am, said he, and upon Hell Be all the shame, whose King and Nobles by The shock of this Temptation headlong fell. This said, near Eve he gently 'gan to glide, Whom straying from her Husband he espy'd. 271 Unhappy Error that, which could invite The jealous Tempter to be bold, since she Had robb'd herself of all her Spouse's Might By starting from his holy company. But all the way the spightful Serpent went, He put on looks of contrary Intent. 272 For Love and Friendship smiléd in his eyes, Fair on his face sate Tenderness and Care: His flattering Neck he bowéd thrice, and thrice His silent homage he presented her: And then, fair Queen of Paradise, said he, Why must the Prince be bound, and Subjects free? 273 We crop our various Joys where'r we please From any floury, any spicy bed; Our dangling diner grows on any Trees; Our Table's over all the Garden spred. But royal you seem stinted in your meat: Have your own Wills, or God's, this order set? 274 Admiring Eve, who had presum'd till now That Speech had been Man's privilege alone; Thought fair respect to this new Talker due, And freely join'd communication: Right glad withal to meet another here, Who with Discourse could entertain her ear. 275 Nay courteous Serpent, she replyéd, we Have large Commission, and our God is kind: He gives us leave to feast on every Tree, And pick and choose and freely please our minde; Bate but that one of Knowledge, on whose boughs Death, certain Death (for so he tells us) grows. 276 O credulous Queen the Serpent answer'd, who Make your own Danger by believing it! Whate'r it be, 'tis not Death's Tree, I trow, Just at whose elbow that of Life is set. I to your self appeal; judge you but whether These two can grow like such good friends together. 277 Death in a Tree! flat contradiction lies Ev'n in the Terms: can Death e'r be alive? Sure Vegetation very ill complies With sapless stupor! O do not deceive Your thoughts, nor teach the Tree of Knowledge how To turn a Tree of Ignorance to you. 278 Observe its goodly Apples: can you spy In those fair cheeks the gastly looks of Death? What fruit in all this choise Variety So much of heav'n's inamoring count'nance hath? Yet grant the worst; suppose it deadly be: For antidote lo there Life's ready Tree. 279 Ask me not whether Truth itself can ly: Since He is God, he cannot but be true: And therfore only by a Fallacy Of enigmatick Truth he cheateth you. Indeed the Tree bears Death; but Death which will Nothing but wants and Imperfections kill. 280 Life-kindling Death, which will destroy you so That you no longer Creatures shall remain; But by this metamorphosis shall grow Above your selves, and into Gods be slain; With eyes divine, discerning Good from Evil, Fair Heav'n from Hell, an Angel from a Devil. 281 Of which since God is well aware, what wonder If he desires a God alone to reign; And so he may, if he can keep you under By this one politic Injunction's chain: If by an Apple thus he terrifies The native Princes of all Paradise. 282 O how it stings my soul to think that you My sovereign Queen should thus fainthearted be! For my part, did ten thousand Mandates grow Cross in my way to bar me from this Tree, Through all I'd break; and so would you, if once Your heart were fir'd by my experience. 283 For yesterday, when first I 'gan to taste The sprightful Fruit, flames kindled in mine eyes; My Soul awak'd, and from my bosom chas'd Those Mists of Ignorance whose thick disguise Muffled my thoughts, and kept me down a beast As dark and dull as any of the rest. 284 But now Serenity unclouds my heart And yields me uncontrolléd prospect to The Orbs of Knowlege, where from part to part My nimbly-piercing eyes securely go. This is the Death I found; a Death which I Mean every day as long's I live to die. 285 How bright a Morn of Science then will rise In your large Soul by this enlightning Tree! My breast is shallow, narrow are mine eyes, But wide and brave is your Capacity; So wide, that Wisdom's deepest Seas may find Sufficient chanels in your mighty mind. 286 And if this Knowledge, if Divinity It self, may merit, but the easy pains Of your Acceptance; O persuaded be To suffer these inestimable Gains: Shall royal You, when I your slave may eat, Be barréd from this deifying Meat? 287 And yet you are not barr'd: what Ramparts here Have barracado'd up the noble Prize? What Squadrons of the heav'nly Host appear To guard these precious Boughs, and awe your eyes? Against your Bliss, O why shall your own Fear Build bulwarks, and raise armies in the air! 288 You are not barr'd; O no; behold but how Y' are bidden welcom by the courteous Tree, Whose laden Arms their glorious offerings bow To meet your mouth, and justify my Plea. What more can hospitable Kindness do! Their very posture's language saies, Fall to. 289 This said; the sweetly-spightful Tempter clos'd His fauning mouth, and proudly joy'd to see Relenting Eve's facility dispos'd To swallow his bewitching Fallacy: Since with her licorish eyes she 'gan to taste, He hop'd her teeth would venture on the Feast. 290 Indeed his Charms had open stole her heart And delicately thrill'd their poison in: The smiling Apples also plaid their part, And with her eyes her fond affections won. Besides, capricious Pride did her invite, What'er it cost, to trie that new Delight. 291 But having thrice step'd to th'inchanting Tree, As oft her Conscience pluck'd her back again: Yet still, with fatal importunity She strugled till she broke her Freedom's chain: With uncheck'd Madness then she rush'd at length To shew her Weakness by her willful strength. 292 Up went her desperate hand, and reach'd away The whole world's Bliss whilst she the Apple took. When lo, with paroxisms of strange dismay Th'amazéd Heav'ns stood still, Earth's basis shook, The troubléd Ocean roard, the startled Air In hollow grones profoundly breath'd its fear. 293 The frighted Trees through all their bodies shiver'd, Their daunted faces down the Flowers held; Th'afflicted Beasts with secret horror quiver'd; With sudden shrieks the Birds the Wolkin fill'd: And deep-pain'd Nature, though but fresh and new, In this sad moment crack'd and crazy grew. 294 But absent Adam's sympathetic heart The sharpest fury of this dint assaild; Who feeling by this ænigmatic smart Himself half-slain, still knew not what he ail'd Only he found his yerning bowels drive His anxious fear to run and see his Eve. 295 O baleful sight! his precious Queen he saw Enslavéd by her soothing Vassal's craft; Her, who was Beautie's Treasury till now, Of bravest wealth's prerogative bereft: Bereft so wholly, that with wondering doubt For his late lovely Eve in Eve he sought. 296 Apparent Misery sate on her Face, The goodly throne till now of Pleasantness: Her Cheeks which us'd to bloom with heav'nly grace, Blasted with Sin, wore now Guilt's hellish dress; And at her Eyes, of late Life's windows, Death Look'd out; and Rottenness flow'd with her breath. 297 But sadder was the Change within; for there Her bold Transgression spred an hideous Night Of Blindness on her intellectual sphere; Her Will, which grew before so fair and streight, Turn'd crookéd and perverse: her Passions broke As she had done her Lord's, her Reason's yoak. 298 Her Heart, till now soft as the Turtle's sighs, Forgets its heav'n-inamoring Tenderness, And with the stubborn Parian Marble vies: Her Thoughts, before all Sons of Love, profess No trade but Mischief, deeply plotting how To propagate that Death she liv'd in now. 299 Nor fears her Rage to play the Serpent too, Mad at her innocent Husband's blesséd state, And him with sweet-invenom'd kindness woo To taste of Hell, and swallow down his fate: Wherefore the goodliest Apples having cull'd, Her treacherous hands with those fair baits she fill'd. 300 Thus with a loving Glance, and modest smile, (Those mighty Arms by which all females fight) She charg'd his eye; and seconded that Guile By trying at his ear this vocal sleight: O wellcom wellcom, since I now have here A banquet fit to entertain my Dear. 301 Soul-fatning Cates, seeds of Divinity, Edible Wisdom, and a mystic feast Of high Illuminations. Ask not why Our jealous God injoin'd us not to taste Of that whose most refining energy Would raise us to be Gods as well as He. 302 As for the bugbear Threat of Death, behold Its confutation in still-florid Me Since I have been thus fortunately bold, Shall needless Dread a Coward make of Thee! Fall to, my joy; I have thy Taster been. Think not the seeking thine own Bliss, a sin. 303 So spake insidious Eve. But he agast, Deeply agast, reply'd with groans and sighs: Sadly he shak'd his head, and smote his breast, And roll'd to heav'n his lamentable eyes. Alas no need, no need there was of arms Him to secure against his Consort's charms. 304 Convincéd He too well the Danger knew Whose miserable Proof now wounds his eyes: Nor could the plainly-pois'nous Apple shew Him reason Heav'n and Virtue to dispise. Fast in his bosom written was the Law, And reverent Terror kept his soul in aw. 305 In aw a while it kept it: but at last Commiseration of his Spouse's case Grew to such strength in his too tender breast As, to himself all pity to displace. Eve sate so near to his uxorious heart That rather he with heav'n than Her will part. 306 For part we must; unless he reconcile That mighty breach which she between them made. O potent Sympathy! which canst beguile An heart so pure and clear-ey'd, and degrade Earth's Monarch from his native pinnacle Of Innocence, as low as Sin and Hell. 307 (Dull and cold-hearted Men stand wondering how The Loyal Lover dares throw generous Hate On his own Wealth and Health and Fame, and grow Ambitious to venture through the gate Of any Death which unto Her may lead, In whom his dearer Life is treasuréd. 308 They little think that here in Paradise His flames were kindled; or that He doth tread In tender Adam's genuine steps, and is Whilst thus effeminate, a Man indeed. A Man; but one who most unhappy is, If his dear She be such an Eve as this.) 309 Thus Adam yields; and eats and tears his great Creator's Law: in rending which he tore His health, his life, his happiness, and that Fair robe of pureness which till now he wore: And thus Eve's woful consort grew no less In nature, than in shameful Nakedness. 310 Their Eyes are miserable op'd; and they Ashaméd of their Maker's work, repine That He who other Creatures did array In Plumes, or Hairs, left them so bare a Skin. Fond Criticks, who the out-side only blame; Alas, 'twas that within deserv'd the shame. 311 Yet sadly now indeed they judge between Evil and Good, whilst their own selves they eye: They who before no Evil Thing had seen, Now staring stand on their own Misery: Which they with wretched Aprons strive to heal; As if the Leaves the Apples would conceal. 312 But O! nor they, nor all the Trees that grow In shady Paradise so thick and high, Could any shelter to their shame allow When He came down to search who is all Eye. Yet finds He them by slow degrees, that so They still a friend might count him, not a foe. 313 He saw at first; but would not seem to see A sight which wounded his Compassion's eye. He saw; but sent a gentle Call to be Their Moniter, and give them space to fly To Mercy's help, before Revenge should draw Her sword to vindicate his injur'd Law. 314 Decent and just the Dialect had been, Had he in formidable Thunder spake: But, having found the Rebels, of their Sin A soft enquiry He was pleas'd to make: Thus begging their Confession, and that they Would with their Crime their Penitence display. 315 Yet they with Shifts and bold Pretences try'd, What should have been bewailéd, to defend: And by that wretched impudence defy'd Mercy, who all this while did them attend. This forcéd justice who came rushing in, And did her office upon saucy Sin. 316 She first pronounc'd that Curse; which deep was writ, In adamantine Tables, ne'r to be Revers'd by Clemency: Then out she shut The proud Delinquents, setting Eden free From its unworthy Guests, and ordering fate To range a double Guard before the Gate. 317 A Troop of Cherubs strait marshalléd At th'Eastern Avenue in dreadful state: And then a flaming faulchion brandishéd Terror about the way, that none might at That door of Happiness pass in, but who By try'd Purity through fire could go. 318 The woful Exiles were no sooner come Into the wide wild world, but Adam sees The heavy loss of his incloséd Home: Finding, in stead of blessed Flowers and Trees, Thistles and Thorns all arm'd with pikes and pricks, Amongst whose crow'd he vext and tatter'd sticks. 319 Long was his Toil and Strife; e'r he could make The Ground give fertile Answer to his sweat. Nor sought the righteous Earth alone to take This vengeance on his Crime: but all the great Cognations of Beasts, Birds and Reptiles broke Off from their sullen necks his regal yoke. 320 Those who were able, mustered up their might Him in their Maker's quarrel to persue: The weaker from his presence sped their flight Professing now they knew no homage due. Thus by their fury those, these by their fear Equally frightful and vexatious were. 321 No friend he had but Her who did betray Him to that need of friends, unhappy Eve: Yet must the reaping of his sweetest Joy Of what was sweeter Him and Her deprive: Their gains unable were to quit the cost, For now their dear Virginity was lost. 322 Through many nauseous months poor Eve must pass E'r she can to her hardest Travel come. O who can tell the Pangs by which she was Tortur'd and torn, when her impatient womb It self unloaded! for the Curse was sure, Nor could those Torments ever find a cure. 323 In sin conceiving she brought forth in pain, And with Pollution dy'd her Progeny: Through all Successions her anneiled Stain Still propagates its own Deformity, And all her Heirs binds in an obligation Of Death, and what is deadlier, Damnation. 324 Besides, the peevish and importunate Itch Of restless kicking at Heaven's gentle Law, Proudly triumph'd its fretful Taint to stretch Through all the Current of her Blood; which now In humane veins so madly boileth, as Proves that it kindled at Hell's furnace was. 325 Thus when infuséd Death lives in the Spring, All those invenom'd streams which from it run, How far or wide soe'r they travel, bring Along with them that first contagion: The furthest Drop not knowing how to scape The reach of that original Mishap. 326 Yet call not God unjust, who suffers thus Poor harmless Babes e'r they be born, to die: Unsinning Sinners; strangely vicious, Not by their Faults but their Affinity: He's righteous still and kind; and knows a way Through Wrath and Judgment, Mercy to display. 327 No Plot of Satan's spight must undermine, Or make a breach in His Creation's frame. Nature shall still proceed, and Heaven's Design Of Man's Felicity persist the same. Godlike it is indeed Fate's scales to turn, And make them Blest who to a Curse were born. 328 Blest with more generous and victorious Bliss Than if the Curse's brand had never seal'd Them up in slavery to Death; thus his Renown more glorious is who wins the field After his Overthrow; than theirs who ne'r Disaster's game, and Conquest's booty were. 329 The black Inheritance of Adam's Crime As God permits to fall upon his Heirs: So He provides to re-imbellish them With fairer nobler portions, and repairs The Damages which from their Parents' veins They drew, by most invaluable gains. 330 In JESU's Blood such purging Power flows, That from it's smallest Drop's alconquering face Away fly both the Stains which blur the Boughs And that which banes the Root of Humane Race. And this dear Fountain in Decree was broach'd Long e'r the Soul by any Taint was touch'd. 331 They who desire't, may here refinéd be Into a Claritude becoming that High Paradise, of whose Felicity Fair Eden only was the Shaddow: but Such Blisses Scorners would themselves have thrown To Hell, though Eve had never help'd them down. 332 And tell me Psyche, what thou thinkest now Of thy Extraction, which from wretched Dust, The scum of Earth, and game of winds, doth flow: What of thy Kindred's rottenness, who must Corruption for thy Mother own, and all The Worms, which crawl in mire, thy Sisters call. 333 Yet Worms but to one only death are heirs, A Death which quickly will it self destroy: But thy Composure in its bosom bears A living Poison, that may find a way To kill thee with surviving Death, by which Thy Torture to Eternity shall reach. 334 Think well on this, and if thou canst, be proud, Who by the Pride of thy prime Parents art With this destructive Portion endow'd, And from thy Birth betroth'd to endless smart. Think what vast gulfs of Distance fixéd be Twixt Majesty's great King, and worthless Thee. CANTO VII. The Great Little One. The ARGUMENT. The Angel convoys Psyche to the Scene Of Mercy's grand Exploits, to shew her what Dear care it cost her Lord to wash her clean From every sinful Soul-deflouring Blot. Betimes he 'gins, and from the morning Glory Of Love's bright Birth lights in the blesséd Story. 1 Illustrious Spirits of Fire, whoe'r you be This Lesson will with no discredit cool Your towring Flames; nor must heroic Ye To Pysche's Legend scorn to go to School. Such Sparks as you for all your glittering, be In your original as dim as she. 2 All mounting Fires at length to Ashes bow; So must brave ye: yet they were lighted from Some generously-flaming Fount; but you And your Extraction from dead Ashes come. Whither forward you or backward turn your eye, Your Bounds are Vileness, Shame, and Misery. 3 No aromatic Baths which wantonize In costly dalliance with the pamper'd skin: No proudly-sumptuous Robe which fortifies Your flesh with gold and pearls and gems; can win Upon your Principles to make them bend Life's race to any but an odious End. 4 Examin Alexander's Monument, And cast on Helen's Tomb your searching eye: Or if your nostrils dread the baneful scent Of their in vain embalméd Majesty; Trust that strong Proof, which bids you sadly think That you, though great and fair, must end in stink. 5 But trust not Pride, whose tumid treachery Could all the World to Rottenness betray. No Poison's fury ever swell'd so high Or to such certain Death prepar'd the way. Steep headlong Danger on the mountains reigns: Who would with Safety walk, must trace the plains. 6 Plain are the Paths of mild Humility, And hatch no Precipice, but planted are With sweet Content and pious Privacy, With cheerful Hope, and with securing Fear. Ruine's prevented and disarm'd by those Who in the lowest orb their motion choose. 7 The Tempest's aim fights with those lofty things Which rise against it, and its strength defy; This to the high-look'd Pines destruction brings, Suffring the modest shrubs in peace to lie. Thus come proud Rocks to rue the angry Wind, Which to the humble Vales is always kind. 8 Right provident's this Virtue, and acquaints Aforehand with her Dust and Ashes; she Dissembleth not by any flattering Paints The wrinkled Warnings of Mortality. She dies betimes, how long soe'r she lives, And Death but as a long known friend receives. 9 Her hearse she hugs and dares imbrace her tomb, And pant and long her final Ev'n to see; When in that cool and undisturbéd Home Her weary head to rest may setléd be: Assuréd of a Friend whose care hath found For her to heav'n a passage under ground. 10 She strongly woos the Worms to craul apace; She prays, not slow Corruption, to make haste: Toward Death for life she runs, and thinks her race Was ev'n in youth an age: On, on as fast She speeds, as sighs of love can blow her, or Fire of unquenchable desire can spur. 11 O meek Ambition, which canst Pride convert Into a Virtue, and make Venom grow Plain Antidote! by thee th'imbraved Heart Aspires and reaches still to be more low; And prides itself in nothing but to be From Pride's dominion intirely free. 12 So free, that when all contumelious Scorn Marches against her in complete array, She meets her Shame, and joys to be forlorn. And by despiséd yielding wins the day: She wins; and like the Ball, the more profound Is her depression, doth the higher bound. 13 The seeds of this fair Grace deep planted were In Psyche's tender breast by Charis's art, Which, as they sprouted up, with heav'nly care To weed and dress them Phylax play'd his part. And now to make them flourish higher, she Will with her liberal tears their Waterer be. 14 Her Guardian his discourse no sooner ends, But she begins, first with her showring eyes; Then with her tongue, which with those torrents blends Its lamentations: Wo is me, she crys, What now shall Psyche do, who needs would be Proud of her shame and pois'nous misery! 15 Your scorn, so deeply earn'd by wilful Sin, My wrongéd friends, as due to me I claim. My guilty Soul's calcin'd, O Charis, in Those heav'nly beams which in thine aspect flame. How can such Nightbirds as vile I indure The holy lightning of a Look so pure? 16 Strange me! who must for your neglect petition, And sue to want the influence of Bliss: Whose sickness makes me dread my best Physition: Whose hopes of ease, are only more Distress: How sadly cross is my Calamity, That now your Anger must your Pity be! 17 And you dear Phylax loose your pains no more On an incorrigibly-hideous Thing. Why should proud Psyche dwell as heretofore Under the shelter of thy slighted wing? O let it free itself, and take its flight: Let not black I defile an House so white. 18 The odious Bat with more decorum will Flutter about what is as dark as she: Her sooty wings will make a seemlyer vail For correspondent ugliness in me. The ominous Raven more sutably will spread Her swarthy plumes o'r my polluted head. 19 Let me enjoy the just inheritance Of my deep-stainéd birth: was I not born Apparent heir to an entail'd Offence: And in my wretchéd Being's lowry morn Dawn'd not eternal Night? what alas, In my life's spring but death infuséd was? 20 And to those shameful Principles have I Not been too truly true? have I not trod The ways of darkness ever since mine eye Beheld the light; and kicking at my God Approv'd myself Her genuine brat, who chose Her Eden rather than her Lust to loose? 21 Why must my breath deflower the virgin Air? Why must I load the harmless Earth with guilt? Why must I blot the world, which would be fair Were I away? my tomb is ready built In any place where filth and dunghils lie: Let justice have her course, and let me die. 22 There's my due home, where Arrogance and boid Rebellion dwell; O let me thither go! May worthy Eyes behold the Sun's fair gold, And view their way to heav'n: I have to do With nought but Pitch and Blackness, which may hide The equal horror of my stubborn Pride. 23 My injur'd Spouse, (O why do I blaspheme!) That Spouse who long desiréd to be mine; Methinks from heav'n doth with a searching beam Full on my face and faithless bosom shine, And by that light read all the treason I Have wrought against his loving Majesty. 24 O, it will scorch me up! my sinnews crack, My bones are burnt, and all my marrow fries; My bosom melts, the flame devours my back, My heart flows down, and wretchéd Psyche dies. I die, yet breathe; my Death surviving is: O what what slaughter ever slew like this! 25 Surely the flames which burn all Hell so black, Are cool and gentle if compar'd with these; Why go I not to hug my kinder Rack, And from th'infernal Torments borrow Ease? Forbear fond fruitless Tears; your flood's too weak The greater Torrent of this fire to slake. 26 Here Phylax here; lo I myself ungird! This Token can no treacherous heart befit. Return it back, that my abuséd Lord Some loyal constant Soul may grace with it. What, will it not unbuckle? must I be Still pris'ner to this wrongéd Courtesy? 27 And must this Girdle now besiege me round With an indissoluble Check of my Ingrateful madness? must I thus be bound Up in myself, and not have room to fly From what I more abhor than Death and Hell; The sinful Blots which this vile bosom swell? 28 So strait about my gripéd soul the chains Of deep Damnation can no torments ty, As this sweet Cincture binds me to the pains Of selfconfusion: O me!—Here her cry And wounded Spirits fainting, down she fell Griefs total pray, and Pity's spectacle. 29 At hand was Pity, Charis being by, Whose yearning soul all Pscyhe's sighs did move; But rous'd more by her fall, she instantly Awoke the nimble violence of Love: Love fir'd her heart, her hand her heart obey'd, And quick relief reach'd to the swoning maid. 30 Whom up she snatch'd, and with a sweet embrace Instilléd gentle warmth into her breast; Whose entheous energy knew how to chase Grief's vast Plethora from its deepest nest; And by delicious degrees restore Her shipwrack'd thoughts to their composéd shore. 31 Thus a new stock of spirits have I seen Health's Factor to his fainting Patient give; Who though his heart were sunk and gone, doth in The precious Potion it again receive; Whilst from the cheerly Salutiferous cup A draught of liquid Life he drinketh up. 32 Awakened Psyche with amazéd eyes Beheld her Friends; but wonder'd more to see Her stout Disease so tame a Sacrifice To that celestial Cordial which she Felt in her glowing breast so strangely seize Her heart, both with Astonishment and Ease. 33 For up and down ambiguous fancies tost her, Uncertain whither some dream's flattery Into a vain Elysium had cast her; Or by some courteous Gale's compassion she Were truly snatch'd from Sorrow's raging billows, And on the bank lay'd safe on Peace's pillows. 34 Which Charis marking; you may trust, said she, Your sudden Happiness, which wears no Cheat. But see that you misplace no thanks on Me, Which all are due to none but to your great And constant Spouse, who though by you forgot, Could not so soon his Love's remembrance blot. 35 Those life-renewing sweets I brought you down, Were none of mine; He sent both them and me: Your wants He knew, and counted them his own, Who long has long'd you One with him would be. Then by these Comforts which have cur'd its smart, Learn who it is that most deserves your heart. 36 And O take heed you dally not too long, Nor fancy that to you Necessity Has chain'd his love: for though full many a wrong He can digest, yet there's a time when He Mock'd and neglected, justly will disdain To wooe his peevish worms, and love in vain. 37 O'rpow'rd with most unweildy thanks and praise At this vast tide of her obtruding Bliss, Here Psyche strove her labouring breast to ease: She strove, yet could nor thanks nor praise express; For what she had conceivéd, was so great She neither could contain nor utter it. 38 But Phylax pitying her sweet agony, Cry'd, 'Tis enough; Heav'n hears ev'n mute desires. Come Psyche, you shall travel now with me, To find full fuel for your amorous Fires. It will be worth your voyage, when you see What balm there grows to heal your misery. 39 The God of Goodness by his powerful eye Reaching those Things which yet were short of Being, Read in the volumes of Eternity The fortunes of the future World; where seeing What mischief would be done by foolish Pride, A potent Remedy He did provide. 40 Indeed had no Redemption's Need invited Thy Spouse's Blood to wash the stains of sin; To Man's poor Nature he had still united His own; that all this All might thus have been Ty'd to its loving Maker, and by this Dear Knot become near sharer in His Bliss. 41 (Else must the world acknowledge Adam's Crime To be its Patron, and confest that all Its exaltation unto this sublime Felicity ariseth from the Fall: Else must his bold Rebellion by that God Have been ordain'd, who strictly it forbod. 42 Ordain'd it must, it must, have been, unless The glorious Theanthropick Mystery, Which all Immensities' Exploits profess The greatest, noblest of their rank to be, Hung on vile Chance's wheel, and so became No certain Project, but an After-game.) 43 But seeing by hereditary stains The stream of Human blood runs foul and black; Meet work it found the Virtue of His Veins The poison of the tainted Flood to check: Which how He nobly manag'd, thou shalt see, When I have led thee through his History. 44 As now She cheer'd her heart and count'nance up, A radiant Chariot caught her wondering eye: The fervent Steeds foam'd at that little stop, And though their wings were down their thoughts did fly Speed was the Chariot's metal, and each wheel Fram'd of the heart of nevertiring Zeal. 45 Come Psyche come, the Coach for haste doth call, Cry'd Phylax; fear not, 'tis no Cheat, nor will This, like thy other, whirle thee to thy Fall. In, in; the Reins in my sure hand shall dwell. If you, sweet Sir, will have it so, content Said she, and meekly blushing in she went. 46 For now she durst no more distrust his Care; Which though she understood not, yet she loved: Three times she op'd her lips, but reverent Fear Her Curiosity as oft reproved: His Company so precious was, that rather Than ask, she yields to go she knows not whether. 47 Up flew Devotion and Chastity, The gallant Steeds, and snatch'd the wheels away. Her native Albian strait forsook her eye, Lost in a Sea of Air: and now the gay Wealth of the Fields of Gallia back as fast Behind her fled as she did forward post. 48 Then climbing higher in her yielding Road Eternal banks of obstinate Frost and Snow, By which stern Winter th'Alpes' proud back would load, Spight of the nearer Sun, she leaves below; And malgre all the sullen justling Clouds, Down through th'Italian Heav'n directly crowds. 49 Into that Region thence she launch'd, which by The Adriatick storms is wont to frown; And far beneath her saw that Ocean lie Whose mid-land Arms about the Isles are thrown: So well did Phylax stere, that to a Port So distant, ne'r was made a Cut so short. 50 For having reach'd blest Palestine, and flown O'r several groveling towns of Galilee, Her steeds in gentle circles flutter'd down, And made their stand at Nazareth: where she Viewing the simple Village, wonder'd why Her Convoy thither took such pains to fly. 51 But Phylax leading her into the most Unlikely house; Consider well, said He, This precious Monument, whose want of cost Upbraids their arrogance who needs will be Immur'd in Cedar, and roof'd o'r with Gold: O that poor Dust should be so proudly bold! 52 This silly Mansion, though it scarce could win Ev'n Poverty herself to be its guest, Was once the House and Home in which the Queen Of Glories kept her court: in this mean Nest Dwelt She, in whose illustrious Family Heav'n long'd and joy'd a sojourner to be. 53 She, th'Excellence and Crown of Females; She Great Jacob's Ladder; Aaron's budding Rod; The crystal Princess of Virginity; David's fair Tower; the Mother of her God; Mary herself: O may that lovely Name Be Blessings but, and Fame's eternal Theme? 54 Her plain cates there she eat; or rather kept Her healthful rules of sober Abstinence: Her prayers there she ply'd; and there she slept When midnight zeal had tir'd her mortal sense. No Corner in this house but heavenly she Knew how to dedicate to Piety. 55 How many Temples in this narrow Cell Were by her brave Devotion rearéd up; Who gave each Virtue licence here to dwell; But at Sin's knock the Door refus'd to ope, Since she appointed had Humility For Porter, and made holy Fear the Key. 56 Here on her pious knees she wept, one day, In wondering meditation of that She Whom God would choose to make the noble way Unto his own foretold Humanity; That She, who to all Females would restore Much more than Eve had forfeited before. 57 And musing what strange-temper'd soul it was Which could be capable of such divine Prerogatives and holy Glories, as Would make the goodliest Seraph fairer shine: Unto that sweetest heavenliest Riddle's praise Her delicate Astonishment she pays. 58 Not for a thousand worlds would she have thought Her self the longdesignéd She: but rather Would at a thousand thousand's price have bought A Handmaid's place, to wait on that great Mother; To wash her blesséd feet, or bear her train, In whom all Excellence rejoyc'd to reign. 59 But whilst her meek admiring fancy towred Through this high Contemplation, and her eyes Their joyous and applauding crystal poured; A bright and gallant Stranger hither flies: One who from heav'n her sweet Reflection brings; And was her Copy, bating but his wings. 60 Youth blooméd in his face, the blesséd throne Where purest Beauties in fair triumph sate: A brisk and sparkling Combination Of ravishing Joys in either Eye was met: His Looks commanded Love, but ugly Lust By potent Purity they still represt. 61 His head was crown'd with its own golden hair, Which down his back its dainty riches shed: The Alabaster of his neck was bare; Sweetly betraying what below was hid In his green ambush of that robe of silk, Which gently hover'd o'r his fleshy milk. 62 This robe was garded with the orient lace Which trims Aurora's virgin coat: Neglect Seem'd to have put it on, yet comely Grace Its incompos'dness curiously deckt. And thick in every careless fold and plait To catch spectators' wonder lay in wait. 63 A silver Girdle with the ready mode Of nimble Travellers his loins imbraced: Like Love's bright Bow his left arm bended stood On his fair side; his right hand bore, and graced, A Lily, which by proofs soft, white, and sweet, Near kindred claiméd with its dainty seat. 64 The Candor of his Wings was no such kind Of glaring thing as stares in Alpine snow, Or in the Cignet's bosom is inshrin'd, Or in Milk's supple streames delights to flow: But of a starry tincture, pure and bright, Made not by scorching but by whitening light. 65 An heav'nly Citizen was He, and one Whose place is in a higher form than mine: In near attendance on his Maker's throne His archangelick beams have leave to shine: And thence, when Heav'n has greatest bus'ness here He is dispatch'd the choice Ambassader. 66 But though his eyes their education had Amongst those Claritudes which gild the skies, He found that he at home had never read So much of heav'n at large, as here he spies Epitomizéd in the lovely Glass Of Mary's modestly-illustrious face. 67 And Hail said he, thou dearest Favorite Of Glorie's King, in whose selected breast His Majesty with singular delight Designs his private and mysterious Rest. Hail Thou the Crown of Females, on whose head Their best exuberance all Blessings shed. 68 The meek Maid started at his stately look, And Salutation's strange sublimity: The complemental Youth she could not brook, Who us'd all charming company to fly: Until his wings admonish'd her, that He One of her wonted heav'nly Guests might be. 69 Yet still her lowly Soul could not digest The tumor of his odd Hyperbole; Which long she boulted in her thoughtful breast, Deeply suspicious least some flattery Had borrow'd an Angelick shape, by which A Woman it more eas'ly might bewitch. 70 O strange, O meekly-noble Jealousy Which only in such holy bosoms rests: The all-securing Bar which warily Th'approach of heart-disturbing foes resists: Sin's usher Pride, finds no access to thee, So low ly'st thou, so high struts burly He. 71 When Gabriel observ'd her doubtful Look, Where Palédness and Blushes mutually Their timorous and graceful stations took; Mary, thy anxious Lowliness, said he, May spare these pains: no Danger dares draw near Her whom the Prince of Power holds so dear. 72 The Sovereign Lord of Love hath seal'd on thee His amorous heart: his most selected Graces; The Flower of all his sweets; th'Immensity Of his best favors, signally he places On thee alone, whom he exalts as high As thou art sunk in thy Humility. 73 Witness this Message I have now to tell, Too glorious I grant, for me to bring; The only Message which could parallel The boundless Love of heav'n's inamor'd King: A Message which the World hath long expected, But fit to Thee alone to be directed. 74 Behold thy privileg'd womb shall fertile be, And breed all Ages' Hopes, that blesséd Child Who at the season of Maturity, Shall this dim World with Grace's lustre gild: Nor need'st thou study to contrive the frame Of his due Title; JESUS is the Name. 75 A Name more fit for thy all-conquering Son Than e'r it was for Nun's triumphant Heir: More noble shall be that Salvation By which his Israel He will repair, Than that which from Beersheba unto Dan Gave them no more but earthly Canaan. 76 Great shall He be; as great as Might and Worth Can swell an Hero's; or as stoutest Fame Can at her widest Trumpet's mouth bring forth, Which shall be stretch'd with his magnific Name: A Name of Wonders; for his Stile must run Of him who is most High the equal Son. 77 The Sovereign Lord of Crowns and only King Of Scepters, shall establish him upon His Seat from whose high Linage he shall spring, His most renownéd Father David's throne: Where he a Prince of nobler Peace shall sit Than Solomon with all his Wealth and Wit. 78 All Jacob's Seed to him shall homage do, And wear the yoke of his more Gentle Law: Yea Time itself shall be his Subject too, And make his Sithe before his Scepter bow; For Earth shall sink, and Heav'n shall melt, but He Shall reach his Kingdom to Eternity. 79 And here the Angel paus'd: But trembling She Vail'd in the scarlat of her modest cheek, Reply'd, Bright Sir, it seems you know not Me, A worthless Maid, who for your high mistake Wear no pretence: nor may so great a King From such a wretchéd worm's vile bowels spring. 80 It is enough, and how much more than I Could e'r deserve from his unwearied love, That all this while he hath sustainéd my Rebellious life, and mercifully strove With my Demerits! O bid me not aspire To what transcends my reach and my desire. 81 Yet though my vileness be sufficient to Excuse me from such glorious Exaltation; Be pleas'd to know I am that Mary who Stand yet unmovéd in my Virgin station; Nor ever yet has this my body's bed Been till'd, or sown by any human seed. 82 Perhaps my Looks, in thy unspotted eyes So little breathe of true Virginity, As to encourage thee to this surmise: But whatsoever my deportment be, Forgive my outside unintended sin, For I am still untouch'd and pure within. 83 'Tis true to Joseph I betrothéd am, Since, he disdainéd not unworthy me: Yet Joseph weareth but a Spouse's name, In preface to what may hereafter be: And be assur'd, this is my present case, I know my Husband yet but by his face. 84 How then, O how shall thy great Promise, which Seems too resolv'd to wait upon Delay, Break thus through Nature's sturdy Laws, and hatch Its Project's Introduction to day! I know no Man, and therefore know not how I can both Virgin be, and pregnant grow. 85 Miraculous Meekness! how would meanest Hearts Have leap'd to catch this matchless Dignity From which this most deserving Virgin starts! O how would'st Thou have triumph'd at so high An Offer, had Agenor's cunning thought Of such a Message as this Angel brought! 86 Her answer higher forc'd his Admiration, And op'd the door to this sublime Reply: Fairest of sweets, there needs no disputation About the question; for the Mystery Determin'd is above, by Him who can Without all human help produce a Man. 87 Nor must thy mighty Meekness hope to shrowd Thee from the reach of Glory: for thy worth By being vailéd in that modest cloud, More ameable lustre streameth forth; And 'cause thou fliest Honor, therefore she From Heav'n to Earth is come to hunt out Thee. 88 Nor is there any scaping by thy flight Into thy virgin Incapacity: For that's the only Scene which suits aright With what thy God now means to act in thee. He acts; and therefore now his Creature can No longer plead, She knoweth not a Man. 89 Through mounts of Miracles he breaks a way To keep thee still as pure as thy Desire; When all things in their first Confusion lay, And grovell'd in a shapeless Mass of Mire, Who would have thought the womb of that Abyss Could have produc'd so fair a World as this? 90 But then th'Almighty Spirit spred his wing Upon those hopeless tumults of the Deep: Whose generative Warmth knew how to bring Those seeds to light which in that Night did sleep. Thus came this populous Universe to be Bred in the bowels of Virginity. 91 This Holy Spirit over thee shall hover, And with prolific virtue thee endow: His Shade's substantial vigor thee shall cover; A vigor which disdaineth to allow Weak Nature leave, or possibility To contradict a Virgin-pregnancy. 92 And for this noble Cause (though not alone For this) He who shall thy great Off-spring be, Must wear the Sovereign Title of The Son Of God; for genuine Divinity Shall be engag'd, but in a mistick fashion, In all the bus'ness of his Generation. 93 Doubt not his Power, whose granted limits spred Wide as his boundless Will: all Israel knows How Sarah's dead womb liveth now in Seed Which past the shores of Numeration flows: How Aaron's Rod its sudden Almonds ought Neither to Soil, nor Seed, nor Sap, nor Root. 94 And for more near assurance, know that She With snowy head confest her Spring was past, Thy Cousen both in blood and piety, Cold dry Elisabeth, hath now at last Conceiv'd a Son; an argument to thee How Nature can by Heav'n corrected be. 95 The World had stamp'd the name of Barren on Her sealéd Womb, whose way was dam'd to Hope Of any Seed; yet five full months are gone, And now the sixt succeeds, since Heav'n brake ope That frozen seal: good cause have I to know The time, who was employéd then, as now. 96 I bare the wonderous News to Zachary; And when his trembling jealous Soul would not Credit my supernatural Embassy, I on his tongue a lock of silence put, That he might know God could as easily ope His Spouse's womb, as I his mouth could stop. 97 His silence bids thee trust these Words of mine: And since both Heav'n and Earth's best Hopes attend With panting expectation for thine Assenting word; for their sakes condescend To be advanc'd, and for thy Maker's who By me his best-belovéd Spouse doth wooe. 98 He waited e'r since Time's first birth for thee, And has endur'd a world of sin below, Stretching his strongly-patient Constancy Through every Age of Wickedness till now, That Time at length might bring forth blesséd Thee The sweet Reward of all his Lenity. 99 And now thy mighty Hour is come; O why Mak'st thou the gentlest Virtue prove so hard? Why by thy rigorous Humility Must entring Joy and Happiness be barr'd Back from the longing World! O why wilt thou Not let the Golden Age have leave to grow! 100 Why must the gloomy Shadows which have now Weighed their heavy Wings, in hopes to fly, Return their Night upon Religion's brow, Which 'gan to clear up at the dawn of thy Fate-ripning Birth: and wouldst thou now give way Would strait break open into Grace's Day. 101 Speak, most Incomparable, speak; and let The gravid Universe deliver'd be From pangs, by hearing Thee accept thy great Prerogative of Virgin-pregnancy. This said the Angel clos'd his lips; but by His pleading Looks still press'd his Embassy. 102 As when the Moisture, which was well content To dwell below and nestle in the earth, Is wooed by the Sun's strong blandishment To take an higher home; it issues forth With gentle resignation, and complies In mere submission to possess the skies: 103 So now the lowly Virgin conquer'd by The potent pleasures of her heav'nly Spouse, Exceeds her old by new Humility, And with herself her former meekness throws Before his feet, thenceforth to be whate'r His most victorious Love would make of her. 104 Behold, said she, the Handmaid of the Lord; (For he hath giv'n me leave to use that stile;) Since Heav'n will have it so, may thy great Word My worthless bowels with Performance fill. To my deer Maker I myself resign; 'Tis fit his Pleasure, and not mine, be mine. 105 This noble word no sooner breathéd she, But to the top of joyful heav'n it flew; Where in the wingéd Quire's high melody It found its echo, and was made a new And precious Anthem; for the spheres that day Measur'd their dances by this only lay. 106 All Nature heard the sound, which in her ear Spake life and joy and restauration. O blesséd Musick, which so chearéd her That into Smiles her agéd wrinkles ran: Fresh fire she glowing felt in every vein, And briskly thought of growing young again. 107 For now that Spirit which first quickned her Return'd, and took his seat in Mary's breast. O what Excess of sweets and pleasures bare Him company into his virgin nest! O what pure streams of light, what glorious showers Of most prolific and enlivening Powers? 108 With these flew down Eternity's great Son To be a Son of Time; and parting from His Father's bosom, Glory's sweetest throne, Chose Ashes for his house, Dust for his home: Teaching Sublimity's own Crest to bow, And making of Most High himself Most Low. 109 In vain should I, or all heav'n's Cherubs reach To compass that impossible Eloquence Which might a parallel description stretch For that immense mysterious Confluence Of purest joys with which in this embrace The most enobled Virgin ravish'd was. 110 Only her spacious Soul, the blesséd Sea Where all those floods of precious Secrets met, Knew what it comprehended: Glorious She Relish'd the life of every sacred Sweet, And did in one miraculous instant try The various Dainties of Divinity. 111 For though his Generation's work had been The deepest project of Eternity, Yet were its wonders all transacted in Duration's most concise Epitomy: One single Moment's head was crown'd with this Exploit of most unbounded Power and Bliss. 112 O mighty Moment! at whose feet all Days All Months, all years, all Ages homage tender: To whom all-conquering Time yields up his bays, And vast Eternity would fain surrender His widest Glories, conscious that he Is deep in debt to most renownéd thee. 113 To thee, who this huge universe do'st ty Close to his greater Maker: Thee who join'st These mortal things to immortality, And in one knot both Heav'n and Earth combin'st: Who giv'st fertility a new found Home, And bid'st it flourish in a Virgin's-womb. 114 For Mary now the mansion-house became Of her conceivéd God, who deign'd to take His pattern from her reverent body's frame, And borrow part of holy Her to make A Garment for himself, that he might be As true and genuine Flesh and Blood as She. 115 O Paradise how poor a soil art thou, To this rare Richness of the Virgin's-bed! Life Tree, which in thy heart so stately grew Itself but as the shade of this was spred: Here is the Garden where the noble Tree Of everlasting Life would planted be. 116 Blush all ye Heav'ns above; the Virgin's womb Hath left no looks but those of shame, for you: All Glories here have chose their dearer Home, And fairer shine because they make no show: Here dwells a Sun, whose count'nance is the book In which your dazel'd Phebus dares not look. 117 The most resplendent equal Character, The flaming Brightness of the Father's face, Hath condescended to exchange his sphere And to this lesser Heav'n transplant his Rays: Which yet he hath so sweetned and allay'd That he consumeth not the tender Maid. 118 Thus when to Moses he came down of old Arrayéd all in fire and took his seat Upon a simple Bush; his flaming Gold In mercy to the shrub, rain'd in it's heat, And all the leaves with harmless brightness fill'd, Which he was pleaséd not to Burn but Gild. 119 When this blest Sight had feasted Gabriel's eye; In prostate loyalty he first ador'd The secretly inshrinéd Majesty Of his eternal-new-conceivéd Lord: Whose leave could he obtain, in that mean Cell He would preferment count it still to dwell. 120 Then in the guise of courteous reverence, (Where plain confession glimmered, how he Was loth to part, yea though to Heav'n from hence,) He farewel bids the Queen of Modesty: Yet bears her still in's breast, though not in's eyes, And so to his etherial Home he flies. 121 Whether as he mounts, his News in every sphere He to th'inquisitive Spirits poureth forth, And delicately feasts their hungry ear With those rare wonders he had seen on earth: Till with applause from every Angel's tongue The precious Name of humble Mary rung. 122 Thus Phylax spake: when Psyche swell'd with joy And admiration, cry'd, why may not I My wandering vessel fix in this dear Bay? Where can I safelier live, or sweetlier die? Humilitie's own Palace best will fit Me who through Pride stand most in need of it. 123 Nay then thou by my conduct strait shall see, Phylax reply'd, a fairer House than this; Fairer in more transcendent Poverty, And nobler far in higher Lowlyness. With that into the Chariot again He takes her up, and gently moves the rein. 124 The ready steeds no more monition needed, For through the air they snatch'd their greedy way, And o'r the Galilean regions speeded; No hills were high enough to bid them stay; No winds so fleet as to outrun their place Until the Coach to Bethlehem whirled was. 125 There lighting down; Behold this Town my dear The Guardian cry'd, where fame once lov'd to grow; Jesse's illustrious Son was nurtur'd here; Here reverend Samuel prepar'd his brow For royal Honor, when upon his head The Crown's rich earnest, holy Oile, he shed. 126 This chosen Root in Kings was fertile, whose Successive hands through many ages bore The Jewish scepter; till, with other foes Sin, stronger than the rest, combining tore The Diademe at first to Babel from Its guilty owner's head, and next to Rome. 127 Rome wears it still, and makes this wretchéd land Pay that sad debt its wickedness contracted: How oft has an imperious Command Heavy blood-squeesing imposts here exacted! And drownéd these inslavéd fields, which all With Milk and Honey flow'd before, in Gall! 128 (Such miserable gains fond wilful Men Condemnéd are to reap, who needs will be Driving the self-destroying Trade of Sin: To such heart-galling bonds of tyranny All frantic Nations made desperate haste When from their necks Heav'n's gentle yoke they cast.) 129 This golden Trick Augustus learnéd, and Summon'd the People to a general Tax: The Warrants strait awakening all the Land, Each one to pay in his assessment packs Amain to his paternal City, where Of Tribes and Kindreds lay the Register. 130 Obedience therefore hither Joseph drew: And pious She who by Prophetick Writ Full well the world's Redeemer's birth place knew, Hugg'd this occasion to arrive at it; Rejoycing that great Cesar's act should be Inservient to Heav'n's greater Mystery. 131 Yet prov'd it both to Husband and to Spouse A tedious journy; for the way was long, But short the days: in Winter's inmost House (Cold churlish Capricorn) the Sun had clung The Morning and the Ev'n so close together That there was left no room for cheerly Weather. 132 The holy Travellers through Cold and Frost And northern Blasts, took their unworthy way; (What pious Heart would not have been at cost Of sighs' kind Warmth that sharp breath to allay!) And slow they went; for Mary's time was come, And God lay heavy in her tender womb. 133 Alas, she to her Travel travelléd, And brought at length her weariness to town: In which the court'sy of an hiréd bed To lay her weather-beaten body down She hop'd to find; but barbarous Winter's blast Had Men, as well as Earth, seal'd up in Frost. 134 The Men were Ice; so were their doors; for both Hard frozen stood against poor-looking Guests: Where'r they knock'd the surly Host was wroth, Crying, My house is full. Indeed those nests Were only courteous Traps, which barréd out All Birds but such as store of feathers brought. 135 All Inns by Silken and by Purple Things Were taken up: each Gallant, room must have For his swell'd self, and room for those he brings To swell him higher; room for all his brave And burly nothing, his fond state and port Which in a chamber must alone keep court. 136 Thus was the Universe's King shut out Of his own World as He was entring in: Long had the Pilgrim's noble Patience sought And yet could at no door admission win: And now night crowded on apace, and drew Their curtains who as yet no Lodging knew. 137 Amongst less beastly Beasts, this made them call For pity, seeing none was left with Men: Observe that Rock, which all along the wall Lifts up its head to meet the rising Sun; See'st thou the craggy mouth it opens? that Was then the hospitable Stable's gate. 138 Come near and mark it well, this Cavern was The homely lodging of an honest Ox, Whose chamberfellow was a simple Asse: Nor house nor dwellers needed any locks Or bar, or Host, against th'approach of poor Unlikely Wights to fortify the door. 139 For whom did Fortune's hate e'r plunge so low As not to be above desiring free Quarter with beasts? but since these Saints are now Much lower sunk than lowest Poverty; In noble love of this strange state, with meek Content a correspondent Inn they seek. 140 Calamity besiegeth those in vain With straits and wants, who always ready are With conquering submission, to sustain The brunt of heaviest Misfortune's war. Necessity, is no such thing to those Who what they cannot help know how to choose. 141 The blesséd Travellers soon saw that this Hard Rock less stony was than all the Town; And that plain Brutes were ready to express Far more humanity than they whose own Nature ingag'd them to be Men, and kind To those at least in whom themselves they find. 142 In therefore here with freedom entring, from The Beasts, whose hearts no avarice had fear'd, They borrow'd both a portion of their room, And of their Straw; and there their bed prepar'd: Where to a Temple having turn'd the Cave, Themselves to rest they after vespers gave. 143 But though sleep sealéd up the Virgin's eye, Yet watchful was her heart, and travel'd still; It travel'd through a Vision's Mystery, A way where she no lassitude could feel. Her Womb seem'd all on fire, whence streaméd out A Flash of Lightning, and whirld round about. 144 Round Earth's vast Ball it whirld, and in its way Devour'd all things compos'd of useless Dross, Of idle Stubble, or of fainting Hay: The silver Creatures bare some little loss; But those of genuine gold grew only more Illustrious and youthful than before. 145 The World refinéd by this searching Flame, In every part right radiant grew and brave; No Blemish, or capacity of Blame Peep'd out from east to west: all Creatures gave A fair account of their own selves, and by Their perfect beauty satisfy'd Heav'n's eye. 146 Whilst on this splendid Reformation She Her wonder pours; dame Nature's vigilant Clock Discovering Midnight, rous'd her Piety To its accustom'd Task: the earliest Cock Had rarely crow'd e'r she began to pray; But here you know She faint and tiréd lay. 147 Yet rose she to bring forth her Vows: but now A greater Birth was ripe, the wide-spread Night And Powers of Darkness freely rangéd through The sleeping World, and laugh'd at buried Light; Little suspecting that an Highnoon-Day From Midnight's bosom could erect its ray. 148 When lo the Virgin bare her wonderous Son, Who by the glories of his own sweet face, Commands the dusky Shaddows to be gone And to his conquering Splendor yield their place. Her friends about her, sovereign Pleasures were; And Joy the Midwife which assisted her. 149 No faintings chill'd her heart, no Pangs durst tear Her privileg'd bowels, nor no Cry her throat: Those sad Revenues all entailéd were Upon polluted Beds: She whom no Blot Of sinful Pleasure could pretend to stain, Advancéd was beyond the shot of Pain. 150 No Circumstance of shame or filth could blur The noble Birth: the shame was theirs alone Whose shameless thoughts deflour'd most spotless Her Th'accomplish'd Queen of Purity; and none But theirs the filth, whose slovenish forging brains Rais'd here a Fount to wash the Infant's stains. 151 Her dear Virginity persever'd the same Unbroken Jewel that it was before. As God into her reverend bowels came, Yet ask'd no lock's leave, nor op'd any door; So he returnéd thence, resolv'd that she Should still a Virgin, though a Mother, be. 152 The pregnant Soul thus travelling with Thought, No pangs, or strains, or ruptures feels, but by Ease's own hand deliver'd is; and out Her Off-spring comes all clad in Purity. Her glorious Flame the Fire thus bringing forth, As clear continues as before that birth. 153 Thus when heav'n's Beams through spotless windows pass, The Colours painted there, they borrow; yet They neither rob, nor break, nor blur the Glass, But with more precious Luster garnish it. Their Mother Flowers thus are Virgins still, Though they the air with broods of Odours fill. 154 Thus though great Phebus every morning springs From fair Aurora's lap, yet she as true A Maid remaineth, as those smiling Things, Those rosal Blushes which her portal strew: Heav'n being pleaséd to contrive this way To make her Virgin-mother of the Day. 155 But O Aurora's Day is Night to this Which in the Night from Mary took its rise, To this, the Day of Life, of Love, of Bliss; The Day of Jewels and of Rarities; The conquering Day whose mighty Glories ne'r Shall any Ev'n's obscuring powers fear. 156 The Day which made Immensity become A Little one; which printed goodly May On pale December's face; which drew the Sum Of Paradise into a Bud; the Day Which shrunk Eternity into a Span Of Time, Heav'n into Earth, God into Man. 157 Heaven's twinckling Lights shut up their dazel'd eyes, And paid their blind devotion to the Dawn Of Jacob's Star: the Moon in sacrifice Her loyal Silver to the Golden Crown Of Lusters offer'd, which about their new Though ancient Prince, their royal Circle drew. 158 His softest feathers Winter thither sent To be a pillow for the Infant's head; For sure no harm the honest Season ment When in the Cave his fluttering Snow he spread: But at his presence into tears it fell, Check'd by a whiter chaster Spectacle. 159 Tam'd Boreas, who saucy was before, With gentle manners learnéd to relent; And whispering demurely at the door, Profest himself not only penitent, But studiously ambitious now to make, His Breath the praise of his young Master speak. 160 And fain would all th'illustrious Host of Heav'n, Whose wings were up, whose thoughts already flew, Have hither march'd, and to their Sovereign giv'n A volley of applause and thanks: but due To his dear Mother's brave Devotion This Privilege was, first to salute her Son. 161 She therefore (having with exuberant joy Beheld the Wonder which her self had bred, And opening through exultant tears the way To her inflaméd Spirit, tenderéd Her self a prostrate Holocaust before His feet; and taught the World what to adore;) 162 Cry'd, O my precious Son, and more than mine, How shall thy worthless Mother and thy Maid, With due attendance wait on thy divine Cradle, without thine own almighty aid! How shall my Clod of earth Great Thee embrace For whom the widest heav'n too narrow was! 163 What shall I do, who most distresséd am, And straitned by the vastness of my Bliss! Thou who wert not ashaméd of my Shame, Who thy most abject vassal hast to this Sublimity advanc'd: O teach her heart And hands to act their ravishing Duties' part. 164 These words wak'd pious Joseph: who when he The newborn Wonder spy'd, stay'd not to ask Whose was that brightly-blooming Majesty, But bows down to his necessary task. Those Beams of such convincing sweetness were As left no question but his Lord was there. 165 With reverent adoration on the floor, The pious pattern of his heav'nly Spouse He hastes to copy, and his soul to pour Forth in ecstatick thanks, and praise, and vows: Since at the radiant casement of those eyes God looking out, call'd for that sacrifice. 166 Those Eyes, the Easts of gentle living Light; The diamond quivers of divinest Love; The wells of ever-springing Joys; the bright Mirrors of purer Claritudes than move About the silver heav'ns, when Night is fine, Or when in Cancer's height Day's glories shine. 167 And as Dove's eyes thrice wash'd in milk, upon The neighbouring Rivers answering crystal play; So on the Mother this immaculate Son Divinely dally'd with his Aspect's ray: Thus deigning by his Turtle Eye to prove Himself conceiv'd by heav'n's eternal Dove. 168 His Skin, the throne of softest White and Red, Joy'd that delicious union to shew By which his Mother's Blush was married To that most lovely Dove's all-snowy hue. Ten thousand Ladies' pencils ne'r could teach A cheek so rich perfection to reach. 169 His goodly Head was of refinéd gold, Being it, self to its fair self a Crown. O that the fond bewitchéd Worldlings would, Changing their avarice, prudently fall down And worship this diviner Metal which With surer wealth their coffers would inrich. 170 The Scene his Cheeks round gentle hillocks were, Where ranks of Spices plaid their precious part, And such perfuméd floridness as ne'r Had marshall'd been by Nature or by Art. His Lips like Lilies, whensoe'r they op'd, Of odoriferous Myrrh thick blessings drop'd. 171 As Beryls fairly rang'd in golden rings, So in his richer hands were Graces set. As Ivory, which prides the thrones of Kings, When streaks of Saphir's luster garnish it, Such was his lovely Belly; only this Thrill'd through its beauty warmth and tenderness. 172 As slender Pillars of white Marble which On Sockets of fine gold erected are; So his pure Legs were builded on his rich And graceful feet: His Aspect mounted far Above the Excellence of Cedars, when They look from their majestick Lebanon. 173 His Mouth the Gate of sweetness was; and He Arrayéd round with nothing else but Love. In this miraculous Epitomy All choise Extremities of Glory strove Which should be most extreme, and in that fair Contention every one grew conquerer. 174 For never yet was Beauty known to hold So full an empire as she here possest; Not when in Absalom's accomplish'd mould Her self and her ambition she drest; Not when she reign'd with Fate-inamoring grace In infant Moses his commanding face. 175 As Joseph with these wonders feasts his eye; The reverent Mother of her Son's dear feet Tender'd a consecrated kiss; and by That blesséd taste encourag'd to a sweet Audacity, adventur'd on to sip The roseal dainties of his heav'nly Lip. 176 O noble Kiss! which might a Seraph hire His highest orb to leave, his mouth to wipe, In hopes to drink in more delicious Fire From this young Altar, than from all the ripe Flames of the Empyreum; fire which by No fuel's fed but supple Bliss and Joy. 177 O Kiss, which fetch'd the Mother's springing heart Into her lip, and seal'd it on her Son! Who was his own as ready to impart In answer to her sweet Impression. O Kiss, the sacred Compliment between Heav'n's highest King and Earth's most lowly Queen! 178 This done; her zealous and yet timorous hands Began their duty to the noble Child: Whom having gently lapp'd in swaddling bands, She to her Breast apply'd: whose bottles fill'd With milk, but more with genial Delight, To his first breakfast did their God invite. 179 Which lovely Invitation gracious He Accepting, borrow'd what himself did give. Mean while deliciously-transported She Seemd in that breast he suck'd alone to live: For thither leap'd her soul, and scarce could stop It self from sturting out with every drop. 180 Then in the Cratch (since with no better bed This sorry house could gratify its guest,) Where careless Hay was for the coverings spread, She lay'd him down to take his hardy rest. Thus came the Ox to know his Owner, and The Asse his Master's crib to understand. 181 For both due distance kept, adoring Him Whose generous Goodness saves both Man and Beast; Him who till now alone had nourish'd them And spread in every field their copious Feast. Their Manger and their Hay they well can spare For his dear service whose own Gifts they were. 182 As there He lay, the holy Mother's breast Grew big again with noble Contemplation: Which as her tongue brought forth and sweetly drest In vocal graces, with neat imitation The Cave returns the accents of her voice, And in soft Echos duplicates the noise. 183 Almighty Babe, on whom till now, said she, Heav'n's Wardrobe waited with its purest flames, Whose Mantle was all-dazeling Majesty, Whose Crown was wov'n of Glory's boundless beams; What condescent of mighty Love is this Which of that matchless Pomp can thee undress! 184 Could Clouts and Rags have ever hop'd to be Exalted to this strange Prerogative That wretchéd they should thus to nakéd Thee The piteous alms of their poor shelter give! Surely all simple Weeds shall precious seem Henceforth to me which are of kin to them. 185 Let Silks and Gold go puff up Princes' pride Whose stains require the aid of beauteous vails: A homespun rayment will a body hide When friezing cold, or melting heat assails. Since Thou art thus content, O let not me E'r covet finer than my God to be. 186 Thou art my God; this vesture's dusky cloud No such eclipse can on thy Glory throw, But through its gloominess my faith can crow'd, And see to whom I adoration owe. Lo I adore thee, who art still Most High Though in this bottom of Humility. 187 Fair was thy Throne when thou did'st mounted sit At his right hand whom Celsitude calls Father; When all the heav'ns were bow'd to be thy great Chair of majestick State; when Earth did gather It self up close, and fix'd up stood to be A faithful footstool to thy Sire and Thee. 188 When all the volumes of Immensity Their utmost vastness gladly stretchéd out To spread a correspondent canopy Over thy glorious head: When round about Omnipotence attended on thy port, And fill'd the circuit of thy mighty Court. 189 But now the Scene is chang'd; this sorry Cell, This Mannorhouse of shame and scorn, must be Thy native palace; now thy throne must swell No wider than this Cratch; now poverty Lays for thy pillow Hay, poor faded Hay, Which speaks what Weakness Thou assum'st to-day. 190 Now all those flaming Hierarchies, whose tongue With Hallelujahs fill'd thy royal ear, Are far withdrawn; and thou art left among None but these dull and silent Waiters here, This Ox and Ass; the only servant thou The world's great King could'st ready find below. 191 (Go great Retinues, gaudy Palaces; Go Beds of down, of gold, of ivory; Go wait upon your dainty Prince's Ease, And help to countenance poor Majesty: Yet there lament your Pride's dishonor, since You are not own'd by Glory's only Prince. 192 But though, O nobly-privileg'd Poverty Enriched by this Morn's bright Miracle, Shalt my Delight, my Pomp, my Kingdom be: Thy Rags shall all Embroideries excel, Thy Cottages all marble Towers outshine, Thy Hardship pleasant be, thy shame divine. 193 Thy proper Region's this; and may'st thou be My sole estate and dowry here below: O 'tis sufficient if hereafter We By heav'n's fair store, above may wealthy grow. That, that's the only Realm of Wealth, and there Alone would I be rich where riches are.) 194 And yet, dread Infant, give my Wonder leave To gaze upon a greater Change than this: From thy Almighty Sire didst thou receive Thy equal Self, and sweetly rest in His Bright bosom where unbounded Pleasures swim, Injoying his Eternity with Him. 195 But now art Thou a Son of Time become, And of poor Me, a shorter thing than Time: That Bosom thou exchang'dst for my vile womb, Light's largest heav'n for this dark narrow clime; Of loose Mortality to catch fast hold, And up in Dust thy gallant Godhead mould. 196 All my astonish'd thoughts are swallow'd quite In this Abyss of thy Humility. O vast Abyss! as deep as ever Height It self was high: I yield, I yield to be In this miraculous Sea of Goodness drown'd, Which only Thou the God of it, canst sound. 197 But O how far thine Handmaid is beneath That noble Accusation Gabriel laid Deep to my charge! thy Condescension hath Monopoliz'd Meekness, and the world array'd In Pride's now helpless shame; since though it seek More low than Dust to stoop, yet 'tis not meek. 198 Though ev'n the Thought of Pride's my soul's chief hate, I am not humble; no, nor can be so. This very sight of thy unworthy state Confutes and checks my very Essence, who By being but my self am too too high, Now Thou my Sovereign Lord thus low dost lie. 199 Whilst her most pious soul dissolvéd ran Out at her lips by this ecstatick Heat; A flock of Shepherds with an heavenly Tone Fresh on their echoing tongues in triumph at The Cave arriv'd, which to their wonder yields A fairer Sight then their late glorious fields. 200 In Joseph they beheld the best of Men; The flower of Females they in Mary saw; The sweetness of all Infants in her Son, And how much more than so! their sacred Vow This spectacle determinéd, and they Before the Cratch their duty haste to pay. 201 For with a prostrate soul and bended knee Each one upon that simple Altar laies His tender Lamb: which Offrings smil'd to see So fair a proof of their own gentle praise, Beholding in the royal Babe how nigh They were of kin to his meek Majesty. 202 And then, O mighty Little One, said they, Deign thy acceptance of these rural things, The cream of our poor Flocks: which whilst they stray About the plains, may thy Protection's wings Shield them and us; who for our Deity No other Pan will own but gracious Thee. 203 Whene'r the hasty Wolf, the hideous Bear Or raging Lion challengeth his prey, Let thy Defence's sheltring might appear Th'injustice of their Challenge to gainsay. Alas our Crooks are feeble things, and We As weak as they, build all our trust on Thee. 204 When Heat or Cold, when Wet or Drought, transgress Their proper seasons, O do thou correct Their dangerous encroachments; and repress Those envious Stars which would on us inflict Malignant influence: so shall heav'n and earth See thy bright Power, for all thy clouded Birth. 205 The deep-observing Mother joy'd to hear Their humble Orison: And what, said she, My honest Friends, has call'd you from your Care Thus to attend on this new Piety? To Night and Dangers what has made you leave Your other Lambs; and these what bids you give? 206 Fair Queen of Grace and Bliss, the Men reply'd, Thrice bowing down before her reverend feet, No Fears nor Dangers can our Flocks betide Whilst we are come our newborn King to greet. Heav'n sent us hither; and we need not fear But Heav'n is able to supply our Care. 207 Whilst we our watch amidst the champain kep'd, Befriended by the Moon and Stars, that no Peril might awake our tender Flock, which slep'd In helpless careless innocency: lo There rush'd from heav'n a sudden mighty Light Which from the wide Field chas'd abaséd Night. 208 The frighted Moon and Stars fled all away; With unexpected Gold the sky was drest: We never yet beheld the entring Day With such commanding beams break from the East. 'Twas Glory's Morning this; and in our eyes No Sun, but Majesty now seem'd to rise. 209 With that, and with Amazement blinded, we Fell down, supposing Heav'n had done so too; And that the Beauties of Sublimity Came post on some grand business hear below. And now we see what drew them down: thy Son May well allure Heav'n after him to run. 210 But as dark Bats, and wretched Birds of night, Surpriséd by a stoutly-flashing Flame, Are damp'd with horror at the glorious sight Which seals their eyes and open throws their shame. So we by this strange Apparition lay Besiegéd both with Luster and dismay. 211 We thus the prize of Dread: a radiant friend Who gently hover'd in the neighbour air Upon our fainting hearts fresh comfort fan'd With his kind wings; and cry'd, No night of fear Is this, look up and view this Scene of Joy, Adorn'd in Heav'n's most festival array. 212 We op'd our eyes, and wondringly beheld How Smiles and Pleasures had bedeckt the place; Which seem'd no more a country common field But Paradise's own delicious face: And such we should have thought it still, had we Not hither come, and seen thy Son, and Thee. 213 But yet a Beauty next to yours we read, Well near as heav'nly and as mildly grave; That Angel's who bestowéd on our Dread That courteous Item: his attire was brave; His Looks, Delight's pure glass; most sweet his tongue, From which these blesséd words of solace rung: 214 Behold I bring you news of greater Joy Than kindest Heav'n to earth did ever send; Joy which through every heart shall melt its way, And with the Sun its equal course extend: Joy which must know no limits, but through all The world display its gallant Festival. 215 For to unwitting blesséd you, this morn In royal David's City, Christ, the Lord Of him, and you, and all this world is born: A mighty King, and able to afford The often-promis'd long-desir'd Salvation To his decrepit languishing Creation. 216 Stagger not at the News; but let this sign Stablish your Faith and banish needless doubts: You shall at Bethlehem find this most divine Infant inwrap'd in simple swadling clouts; And in a plain and answerable bed The Asse's Manger, laid, to rest his head. 217 As we for joy at these strange Tidings started, Behold, a sudden Globe of pliant Light Into a stranger Apparition parted, And with new Merveils entertain'd our sight: For at a diamond Table fair and wide A numerous Quire of Angels we descry'd. 218 Soul-charming Melody amidst them sat; At her left hand Applause; Bliss at her right; Before her face triumphant Honor; at Her foot luxuriant but pure Delight. The Spectacle alone was ravishing; But O what Raptures when they 'gan to sing! 219 Glory to God in all sublimity, Peace upon Earth, and to Mankind good will: This was their Ditty; but their lofty Key Not only pass'd our mortal reaches' skill, But surely poss'd the Spheres, tho' these (they say) In sovereign Musick spend both Night and Day. 220 How gladly fell our charméd Lambs to dance! What troops of merry Wolves came tripping thither! Lions and Bears seiz'd with a gentle trance, Met in a friendly galliard together. All salvageness was quickly charm'd asleep, And every Beast became a gentle Sheep. 221 The jolly Birds flock'd in; and though they saw A fairer-wing'd and sweeter-throated Quire, Yet felt they in their breasts such pleasure glow That they could not suppress their cheerly fire; But muster'd up their sweetest powers, to pay Their best applause to that Angelick lay. 222 The Stones look'd up and seem'd to wish for feet; The Trees were angry that they stuck so fast; All things desir'd the Harmony to meet, And their sweet Passion prettily exprest: Our silly oaten pipes this made us break, And our exultant parts with Nature take. 223 And though our feet more nimbly never flew Than in their answer to this Music's Pleasure, Doing their best endeavour to trip true To every turn, and point, and air, and measure; Yet leaping in our joious bosoms we Felt our brisk hearts with more Activity. 224 The Anthem finish'd thus; that glorious Fire About the Company its volumes spread, And homeward convoy'd th'illustrious Quire. We saw how wide a gate heav'n openéd To let them in; we saw it shut, and yield Back to the Stars their free etherial field. 225 Thence came we hither, and the Promise found As true and noble as our expectation: Which from this Cave must by our tongues rebound To every ear we meet; that this Narration May ease our hearts, least by the mighty wonder Of this heav'n-crownéd Morn they split in sunder. 226 But when the Year's fresh youth returns to deck The bed of April in her vernal hue; Its earliest sweets and beauties we will pick, And wreath a chaplet for the fairer brow Of this our blooming Lord: till when we place Our hopes of safety in his only Grace. 227 Which said, three adorations to her Son They made, and then of blesséd Mary took Their humble leave: who having printed in Her mindful bosom's ready trusty book The News, the Quire, the Song, the glorious Light, She duly read the lesson morn and night. 228 And deep she div'd into the reason why That glistering Host kept distance from the Cave, And to these Creatures of Humility, These simple honest Swains, the honor gave Of Visiting meek Him the first, who came To be at once a Shepherd and a Lamb. 229 But when the Sun seven times himself had shown To all the World, and bid it idolize His face no more; but fall before its own Almighty rising Phebus, at whose eyes His flames were kindled; Janus op'd the door, And in her arms Aurora New-year bore. 230 And Circumcision's sacred Day was this; Nor would the royal Infant sparéd be, But took this hard and bloody yoke on his Most tender neck; that exemplary He Who was through all Obedience to run, His Race of Patience might betimes begin. 231 There lay He on his yearning Mother's knee On that sweet Altar his first Blood to offer: And tell me Psyche, whither He or She By this Incision more pain did suffer; For that strange wound was deeply gravéd in Her soul, which only raz'd his body's skin. 232 Yet wise and pious as she was, she knew The wound would deeper prove should she forbear In love's mild disobedience to imbrue Her hand in what her heart esteem'd so dear Her Son's pure blood: since no way could be found To keep his Law whole, but himself to wound. 233 Down fell the purple precious Dew, and gave The World sure earnest of what stay'd behind: For 'twas resolv'd the World at length should have The utmost drop his deepest vein could find. Mean while these few suffic'd to write the bonds By which He for the rest ingagéd stands. 234 O liquid jewels! happily have you Besprinkled all the forehead of the year; The year, which now on his bedeckéd brow Hath leave more beauties than heav'n's face to wear: The year, which sealéd is by you, to be From mischief's heavy Impositions free. 235 Thus when the paschal Lamb's less worthy Blood Th'Egyptian doors of Israel's Son bedew'd, Peace and Security for Porters stood, That no Distruction thither might intrude. Had but this blush on Pharoh's gates been seen, Safety and health, and grace had dwelt within. 236 Now January's Calends washéd be By these dear Drops from all that guilty gore Which Heath'nish most unholy Sanctity Us'd on their face in lavish floods to pour. Fair shines the Day, thus rescu'd and releast From Pagan Stains to Piety's pure feast. 237 And now was printed on the Child that Name Which tip'd and glorify'd bright Gabriel's tongue: That Name whence Blisse's clearest torrents stream, That Name which sweetens every Cherub's song; That Name of bowels, of almighty Love, Of all the joys which make heav'n be above. 238 JESUS! O what vast Treasures couchéd lie Within the bosom of this little Word! A Word which spreads its potent Majesty Through heav'n and earth and hell; all which are stirr'd With reverent awe whene'r it sounds, and on Their bended knees adore the Virgin's Son. 239 JESUS! O Name which shall for ever be The cordial of humble fainting hearts; The triumph of exultant Piety; Religion's richest Sum; Nor shall the arts Of rude and peevish Heresy suppress That Worship which the due Revenue is. 240 JESUS! O Name of glorious Dainties, how, Loth are my ravish'd lips with thee to part! Yet shall thy musick never cease to flow In precious Echos all about my heart. JESUS! O sweeter Name of Life! O Name Which makest famous ev'n eternal fame. 241 These wonders Psyche were atchievéd here, This poor plain Cave with royal worth to crown: And yet not these alone; has not thine ear Been fill'd with Balaam's infamous renown, Whose simple Ass, his fury to confute, Held with her sillier Lord a wise Dispute. 242 This Son of Avarice, and Heir of Hell, By frighted Balak hiréd to enchant And heap his curses upon Israel, Was by thy Spouse inforcéd to recant His dire intent, and like his Ass to make His changéd tongue against his nature speak. 243 Thy spouse's power wrung that bright Prophesy From his black mouth, of Jacob's rising Star: Which he bequeathéd as a Legacy To all his Heirs; and charg'd them to beware That no forgetfulness did Blind their eyes From watching when that promis'd Light should rise. 244 Amongst their mystic Notes these words they laid From age to age, and often read them o'r With dread devotion; being still afraid The Star might at some unexpected door Peep out from heav'n, and spy their souls asleep, Whom Balaam had forewarn'd their watch to keep. 245 No broad-ey'd Comet on the world could look But strait into their studies them it sent; Where, after counsel had with many a book, Through all its flaming lineaments they went; Examining the length of every hair By its own light, which head or beard did wear. 246 But when Eternity's sweet Day began To dawn from this, O how unlikely Cave! A gallant Star into Arabia ran And notice of the glorious business gave To every eye, which was instructed how To read the characters of heav'n's bright bow. 247 Three venerable Men were dwelling there As well within all hoary, as without; Kings of the neighboring fields and boroughs, where They reign'd by secret Wisdom's high repute. No Star, but well they knew; for from the East They long had been acquainted to the West. 248 These looking out that night their friends to view, Espy'd a stranger drest in bright attire, To which their greedy Contemplations flew And busy were about the radiant fire. The more they look'd, the fairer room they found Whereon high expectations to ground. 249 Fond Eyes, which gaz'd long since the Star was set, Dream'd that a flaming Child in it they saw, Whose golden shoulders wore a cross; the wit, Of Superstition thus deviseth how To fool it self, and credit whatsoe'r Deceits in its blind fancies' book appear. 250 A Book which cunning Hell improves so high That it has often cost poor Truth full dear: For Lyes embroider'd upon Verity, The Poison of the wholsome groundwork are. Thus foolish Tares once mix'd with solid Wheat, The credit of the hopeful crop defeat. 251 These sage Observers no such thing descry'd In this unusual Star, but only read A beauteous Miracle, whose beams outvy'd All glories that bright Venus's face could plead: And when the Day drew on, displayéd far More cause why this should be the Morning Star. 252 For when from roseal Aurora's door Fair Titan shak'd his locks and marchéd out; Nor any of the other Spangles, nor Brisk Venus could approve her self so stout To stand the dint of his approaching Light, But slip'd aside and waited for the night. 253 But this brave Star stay'd still, and to his face Boldly told Phebus, he had more to do In heav'n, than he; and that he kindled was, A fairer nobler Day than his to show; A Day which sprung not from his vulgar East, But chose its own Morn where it pleaséd best. 254 The Star's so daring Resolution much Amaz'd the Magi; who in all their old Records of Wonders, could not meet with such A venturous Apparation inroll'd: Nor (did their eyes not urge them to confess) Would grant there could be such a one as this. 255 But since it plainly thus outfac'd the Plea Of any Doubt: their thoughts' Result defined That some incomparable Mystery In its prognosticating count'nance shined: And why, said they at length, may not this be The Star great Balaam's quick-ey'd soul did see? 256 Then throwing all their useless books aside, To Him they su'd who kindled that divine Foresight in Balaam, to be satisfy'd About the meaning of that Flaming sign; God kindly answer'd them and taught them why He check'd the Sun by that fair Prodigy. 257 Heav'n's mighty Love thus universal is, Whilst through the School of Magick Darkness it Disdaineth not with gracious beams to press; That in their black Profession it may meet The Sons of Night with radiant Mercy, and Them to the Day of Bliss and glory send. 258 Their sumptures now they hastily provide, Though yet uncertain which way they should tend: When lo the Star vouchsaf'd to be their guide, And with a moderate pace its journy bend To Palestine; that it might not outrun Their Dromedaries' mortal motion. 259 Sweet was their March: O courteous Star, said they, Who would not follow thy direction! what Sly Error now can cheat us of our way Who under heav'n's bright conduct travel! that Fair fiery Pillar which led Israel, we Now envy not, who convoy'd are by thee. 260 Advancing thus, till Salem's towry head Had met their eyes, they thither turn'd their way Presuming there to find the princely bed Whereon the newborn King of Salem lay. But now the Star grew wroth and hid his face To chide their dotage on that gaudy place. 261 That chode in earnest; but mistaken They Conceiv'd its office was expiréd here, Now to their journy's period his ray Had brought them safe: though old and wise they were, They had not learnéd that the Sovereign Of Lowliness doth worldly Pomp disdain. 262 In joyous haste they through the City's gate Their passage snatch, and bless the happy place Which crown'd and privilegéd was by fate Heav'n's glory to outvy: for there alas With fond hopes swollen they expect to see Thy mighty Spouse's infant-Majesty. 263 With their great question every street they fill, Demanding where his native Palace stood Who now was born the King of Israel; Whose Star has brought us from our own abode, The East, said they, to represent our meet And bounden homage at this royal feet. 264 Much was the boldness of the Men admir'd Who now within the reach of Herod's spight, So stoutly for another King enquir'd, Plainly confuting his usurpéd Right. But Piety is valiant, and can In fearing God, defy the fear of Man. 265 This News with jealous terror having rung Through thousand ears, at length to Herod's came. The guilty Tyrant startled was and stung, Hearing that strangely-broach'd and dangerous fame: His heart throbb'd high, his sceptre seem'd to quake, His Throne to totter, and his Crown to crack. 266 Yet to elude all threatning Omens, He Muster'd his cruel wit, and vow'd to lay Some holy-looking Plot, whose subtilty Both his young Rival and his fears might slay. His rage he clok'd, and in a Synod sought How to resolve the noble Stranger's Doubt. 267 The Priests and Scribes from reverent Records there Produc'd inspiréd Micha's Prophesy Before the King the mighty Point to clear. But to the Pilgrims in his Closet He Wisely imparts the News; and sifts from them Each circumstance of their conducting flame. 268 Which having heard at large: Go then, said He, And may Success your brave Devotion crown; Yet grant your friend this easy courtesy, Not to ingross Religion as your own; But when y' have found the Infant, let me know, That I may Him adore as well as you. 269 No solemn Entertainment now shall stay Your pious zeal, although my Honor be Ingag'd this ceremonie's debt to pay: But when your greater Work's dispatchéd, we Shall take such royal course, that you shall find Our court to strangers cannot be unkind. 270 So spake the wiley King. But honest they, Who had no Star to shew them Herod's heart, Believ'd his tongue, and with well-meaning joy Return'd their thanks; then greedy to depart, Their leave they took; and by devotion driv'n Thought Bethlehem road the only way to heav'n. 271 And now behold, their reconciléd Star, Which justly had disdain'd its beams to shew To curséd Herod, represented their Illustrious Convoy to their eyes; which new And joyful hopes strait kindled in their breast, To see themselves from desolate Night releast. 272 For Day to them had worn no other face But that of black uncomfortable Night: And Phebus posting to another place, Did with his useless beams but mock their sight: Till this most faithful Star again appear'd; Which to their wishes' Port them safely steer'd. 273 But then it stop'd, (for all its work was done,) And pointing with a perpendicular ray Down to the Cave, bid them behold that Sun Of which it self was but the shaddow: They, To whom a moment's stay now seeméd long, In glad obedience from their sadles sprung. 274 Their several Grooms the foaming Coursers took; The Pages their Oblations prepar'd: When musing at the Stable's simple Look Which much below their lofty hopes appear'd, The Princes turn'd their jealous eyes to know Of their bright Guide, if they were right, or no. 275 But when they mark'd what firm assurance shed Itself down from the peremptory Star; They march'd in cheerly; and no sooner had Observ'd the humble Majesty which there Kept open court, but their Devotion grew To such brave height, that them it prostrate threw. 276 The Mother's eyes in theirs rais'd admiration; The radiant Infant's, sacred ecstasy: For in her bosom's balmy habitation His sweeter Head they saw inshrinéd lie; As in the precious and glistering breast Of Mother-pearl the Jewel makes its nest. 277 Though in the glorious volumes of the skies They oft had many a flaming Lecture read; They here perceiv'd these brighter Rarities Strongly confute those twinckling books, and bid Them seek no more for Stars above; nor be So vain as to look upwards Heaven to see. 278 Thrice therefore having kiss'd the ground; Behold, Cry'd they, great King of all the World, poor We Whom by Thy Star thou sendedst for, are bold To creep thus near thy gracious Majesty. The Name of King has flattered us a while, But we resign to Thee that fitter Stile. 279 The foolish World surnames us Wise; but We No more will that ambitious Title own; Which truly due, and suting none but Thee, Before thy footstool here we throw it down: Accounting this our highest Wisdom, that We by thy Grace this Lowliness have got: 280 That King art Thou; the hopes of whose dear Birth Have many fainting Generations cheer'd: That Jacob's Star whose Rising here on earth The shades and types of Prophesies hath clear'd; Displaying to this groveling World, which lay Till now in Darkness, a meridian Day. 281 That sovereign Wisdom, which contriv'dst at first The fabrick of this universal Ball; By thy direction it from Nothing burst; And in thy Counsel's boundless Circle all Motions of heaven and earth still acted be: Both Change and Chance are Certainties to Thee. 282 Here drawing near, and having his Oblation Laid fairly in his Crown; the First, before His infant Lord with triple adoration Thus tender'd his devotion; of the store To me thy bounty has been pleas'd to give, Vouchsafe this humble tribute to receive. 283 It is the purest Gold my care could get, Yet begs now to be gilded by thine Eye: Unless true Richness thou wilt glance on it, Thy hand's acceptance 'tis too poor to buy. If thus this suppliant Gold may be beholden To thy beam's charity, it will be golden. 284 Then came the Second with like reverence, and His Offring in his Royal Censer brought; Accept, sweet Babe, from my unworthy hand, Said he, this Incense, since 't has now found out The next way to its God, and needs not rise In labouring clouds to reach the lofty skies. 285 The noblest 'tis my diligence could meet Amongst the spicy beds of Araby, Which in her first-fruits hither comes, to let Thee know the rest at home is due to Thee, And craves thy leave to kiss thy lovely feet: No way but so, to make her odours sweet. 286 These two fair Copies were transcribéd by The Third, whose Present was delicious Myrrh; And, this to wait on thy Humanity O my incarnate God, I here prefer: That Nature which till now, said he, was poor Ashes and Dust, in Thee we must adore. 287 The Babe look'd up, and with a gentle eye Approv'd their orthodoxal sacrifice; But as the Mother's gracious courtesy Held forth his willing hand to meet their kiss; O no, our lips are too too foul, they cry'd; By his Clout's kiss may they be purify'd. 288 They kiss'd it, and arose: But on the floor Ambitiously still left their Crowns, that they Might gain the honor to be foot-stools for Glory's own Prince; whose court most justly may Be strew'd and pav'd with Diadems, since He Reigns King of kings and Lord of Majesty. 289 And now as much of Night as dar'd draw nigh The native palace of fair Grace's Day Was hither crept; the Pilgrims' modesty Beg'd leave to lodge before the door: for they In loyal reverence durst not think the same Roof fit to cover both their Lord and them. 290 Thus having pitch'd their tents without, and said Their prayers to the God they left within, With sweet content themselves to rest they laid; Where when soft Sleep his gentle stealth began Upon their brows; a Dream came close behind, Which op'd a Vision to their waking mind. 291 God in a mystick Voice, which well they knew By its dear rellish in their hearts, descended, Timely discovering to their wondering view What Herod's bloody Jealousy intended; What ambushes of desperate traps, if they Return'd by Salem, had beset their way. 292 This Warning they, when Morning out had sent The flaming Giant to his daily race, With hasty joy obey'd: yet forward went Their feet amain, but with as swift a pace Their hearts recoil'd, so did their eyes, and in The glorious Stable would again have been. 293 Thus strugling homeward by a private way, Unreach'd by harm they to Arabia came: Where, through th'astonish'd Towns, a full Display They brandish'd of the noble Infant's Fame; Returning richer Gold, and purer store Of Sweets, than they from thence to Bethlehem bore. 294 The precious Name of JESUS, would alone Discharge that debt, and purchase all the rest: The Gold, Myrrh, Incense, which that Region In all its richest hills and vales possest; And authorize each Part of Araby To take its surname from Felicity. 295 Say Psyche now was not this simple Place Most gloriously worth thy journy hither? But Time's at hand which will erect Disgrace On this Foundation of Honor, whither One King shall send as studied Scorn, as three Brought reverent and costly Piety. 296 This Temple of Virginity will He Deform to blackest Lust's unworthy Sty; Rear'd in the blesséd Manger's place must be The curséd Altar of Impurity; And Venus and Adonis' titles swell, JESU's and Mary's mention to expell. 297 O then cry'd Psyche (for the Angel now Clos'd up his lips,) may I that time prevent. At Purity's unravish'd shrine my Vow Burns to be paid. Alas, what though I want Gold, Incense, Myrrh? I have a Heart which fain Upon this Manger's Altar would be slain. 298 It would be slain, thereby a Life to find Which will not give its noble Name the lye: For whilst I linger groveling in this blind Valley of Sin, by Living I but Die. A mortal Life is but an handsom fiction Nothing well-drest, a flattering Contradiction. 299 Here kneeling down, she dews with liberal tears The holy Relique, and with pious sighs Quite blows th'unworthy Dust away; nor cares She though the empty Manger mock her eyes, Since her sharp-sighted Faith could Him descry Who in that Cradle once vouchsaf'd to lie. 300 A thousand hearts she wish'd she had been worth, And full as many times that Wish renew'd; That generously she might have pouréd forth Her single Self to Him in multitude. Over and over she would fain be His, And tries Love's sweet Impossibilities. 301 O what Contentions of Grief and Joyes, And pious Languishments now throng'd her breast! How many amorously-violent ways Her venturous Soul try'd to be dispossest Of Fleshe's tedious clogs, that she might to Her Spouse's pure imbraces naked go! 302 But tir'd by this mysterious agony, Her spirits to the powers of sleep submitted: Oft had they quickned up themselves, and by Stout zeal repuls'd th'inchroaching mists that flitted About her eyes; which yet prevail'd at last, And on the Manger laid her head to rest. 303 Her eyes were clos'd, but wide awake her heart, Which clearly run by Recollection through The noble Story; reading every part And circumstance, she knew not where nor how: Whilst Phylax for her canopy had spread His tender guardian Wing above her head. CANTO VIII. The Pilgrimage. The ARGUMENT. Love's Presentation solemnizéd; He To Egypt through the dismal Desert flies; Where, by the dint of true Divinity, He dasheth down the forgéd Deities: And thence, when Herod had the Infants slain, And Justice Him, returneth home again. 1 Sage Nature, how profound is thy discretion, Inamelling thy sober Courtesies By seasonable useful Intermission! Thou lett'st us feel the Want, to learn the Price; Thou checkerest every thing with such wise Art, That Ease proves constant successor to Smart. 2 When Night's blind foot hath smear'd Heav'n's face, the Day With lovely beauty all the welkin gilds; When Winter's churlish Months are thawn away, The lively Spring with youth chears up the fields; When Clouds have wep't their bottles out, 'tis fair; When Winds are out of breath, Thou still'st the air: 3 When æstuating in her mighty toil The Sea has wrought up to her highest shore, Her weary Floods Thou teachest to recoil Back to that Rest wherein they swum before. And to all great and swelling Labours Thou As sure an Eb dost constantly allow. 4 Yet Sleep the Gentlest of thy Blessings is, With which Thou sweaty Pains dost gratify: When Phebus through all heav'n has speeded his Long smoaking course, Thou giv'st him leave to lie Down on the pillows of the watery Main, Till brisk Aurora wakens him again. 5 When Trees all Summer have been labouring hard Their blossoms, leaves, and fruit in bringing forth; The Night of Winter Thou dost them afford, And bidst their Vigor go to bed in earth; Down to the Root strait sinks the tiréd Sap, And sleeps close and secure in Tellus's lap. 6 When Rivers many tedious months have run Through craggéd rocks, and crooked peevish waies; Thou mak'st stern Boreas pitiful, who on Their necks a friendly-rigid bridle lays: This locks them up in glass, and makes them rest Till they are wak'd by Summer's southern Blast. 7 When Man has travell'd with his hand, or mind, (For this both toils and sweats, as well as that,) Thou in a tender misty Vail dost bind His heavy head, and teach his eyes to shut Out grief and pain, that so reposéd He May hug'd in Sleep's all-downy bosom be. 8 Yet other Creatures little find in Sleep But that dull pleasure of a gloomy Rest, Which they themselves perceive not when they reap: Man by this fuller privilege is blest, That Sleep it self can be awake to him, And entertain him with some courteous Dream. 9 He, when his Touch, his Tongue, his Eye, his Ear, His Nose, in Sleep's thick night are muffled up; Can feel, can taste, can smell, can see, can hear, And in his quick Dispatches meet less stop Than when he wakes; for now his Soul alone Can through his mystick business freely run. 10 O sweet Prerogative! by which we may Upon our pillows travel round about The Universe, and turn our work to play; Whilst every journy is no more but thought, And every thought flies with as quick a pace Quite through its longest, as its shortest race. 11 No outward Objects' importuning Rout Intrudes on sprightful fancie's operations; Who, Queen in her own orb, atchieves with stout Freedom her strange extemporal Creations; And scorning Contradiction's laws, at ease Of nothing, makes what Worlds her self doth please. 12 Nor is the Body more befriended than The Soul, in sound Digestion's work, by Sleep: This is the undisturbéd Season when The Mind has leasure to concoct that heap Of crude unsetled Notions, which fill The troubled brain's surchargéd ventricle. 13 In this soft Calm, when all alone the Heart Walks through the shades of its own silent breast, Heav'n takes delight to meet it, and impart Those blesséd Visions which pose the best Of waking eyes; whose day is quench'd with night At all spiritual Appiration's sight. 14 By this time Psyche having sailéd through The Infant-story, whilst her Dream did steer Her Soul's trim nimble bark; She felt her brow Eas'd of its cloudy weight, and growing clear. Strait Phylax spy'd her looking up, and cry'd, 'Tis well thou hast thy Spouse's lodging try'd. 15 Marvel not how this Manger could agree With that most tender Infant's dainty head: For by this copy He commends to thee The scorn of Wantonesse's plumy bed. Thou seest sweet Sleep is possible upon A cold and churlish couch of board or stone. 16 'Tis not the flatt'ry of fine things without, Which can with genuine softness cloth thy Rest. Down proves but precious thorns, and silk doth flout His hopes of quiet sleep; whose treacherous breast, Though with external unguents sleek, within Is harsh and rugged, being lin'd with Sin. 17 The honest Plowman in the simple straw, Which furnish'd his first board, and now his bed; Reaps solid savory Rest, and steeps his brow In deepest Ease: whilst though the Tyrant's head Be laid in Delicacy's softest lap, By knawing fears and cares 'tis plowéd up. 18 If Vice and Vengeance had not us prevented, We to the Temple now our way should take: But they have revell'd there; and those lamented Ruins, too late a sad confession make. Fire, and the Roman rage on it have prey'd, And all its Glories' flames in ashes laid. 19 Whilst yet it stood, the Virgin-Mother, when The Law's time cited to Purification; Hastes thither with her early-pious Son To pay obedience to that needless fashion: Needless to Her, who of no human seed Had ever been the spotted sinful Bed. 20 Dare Ceremonies think themselves so clean As to presume to wash the Morning's face When she hath brought forth Glory's Sun, and been New-gilded by that birth with brighter grace! How shall the virgin Crystal purer grow! What legal Rites can purge and whiten Snow! 21 Yet was the gallant Morn content to go; So was the spotless Crystal, and the Snow; And own Pollution, rather than not do Their ready homage to the reverend Law. Which yet was by a stronger back'd, for She Went summon'd by her own Humility. 22 And there arriv'd, the Substance to the Shade She join'd, and clear Truth to the misty Type; Broad Day She of a glimmering Twylight made; Long-breeding and crude Hopes she turn'd to ripe Fruition; and to conquer all example, A fairer Temple brought into the Temple. 23 A Temple, where not one, but every Gate Was Beautiful; a Temple where each part Most holy was; a Temple where, though State Shin'd not without, Heav'n's Monarch kept his court; A Temple which its strange foundation had Above; a Temple which was Man and God. 24 When he drew near, the Walls and pavement smil'd, The Roof would fain have bow'd to kiss his feet; The pious incense smelt the sweeter Child And chang'd its usual path, with Him to meet: It soard not up, but to the door inclin'd, To heav'n the shortest passage so to find. 25 The Cherubs which dwelt close behind the Vail Had much ado to keep themselves within; Knowing that from their secret Oracle The outward Temple now the Glory won; In which a higher Priest appear'd than He For whom alone their Privacy was free. 26 O how the second Temple's strange Renown Dazell'd the First! That fabrick rearéd by David's wise Son, bow'd long aforehand down To this young Temple's following Majesty; And kiss'd the dust, surrendring thus its place, Since Jesu's Presence was this House to grace. 27 And now the Mother on her bended knee Presents to Heav'n her Son before the Priest; Whose Priesthood O how far transcendeth She Who offers God! into her bosom's Nest Th'Eternal Father having sent him down, Right noble she thus yields Him back his own. 28 When reverend Johazar received the Child, Through all his breast a secret gladness ran: Much he admiréd how his heart came fill'd With more than usual devotion; Not yet aware that in his arms far more Than Paradise, or Heav'n it self, he bore. 29 For wise, and most severely humble She Her tongue would never licence to unfold, What might an argument of honour be To her all-glory-shunning Self: nor could Or durst she think, but her great Infant knew Himself, when best it was himself to shew. 30 But then (admonish'd by the courteous Law) She with five shekels buyeth back her Son. Were thousand Worlds her own, She would bestow Them, and her self, for his Redemption: But this poor Price serv'd her to ransom Him Who Her, and all the world, was to Redeem. 31 Two milky Pidgeons (her own Emblems) She Then pays as duties of Purification: The gentle Birds a mourning fell to see How they had lost their dearer habitation: Less sweet they thought the Altar, and would fain Be nestling in her breast or lap, again. 32 But holy Simeon, whose stout Expectation Grounded on Heav'n's high Credit, did sustain His agéd life; by potent inspiration Forgot his leaden pace, and flew amain Into the Temple: for the nimble Blast Of God's own Spirit lent him youthful haste. 33 O how his greedy Soul did work and beat, And think the time an age, till he was come To his dear Blisse's shore! where, in the heat Of hasty zeal, he snatch'd his Saviour home Into his longing arms, and heart, which broke Out at his lips, and thus its passion spoke: 34 O Life, thou now art out of debt to my Long-stretch'd Attendance, and canst nothing show Of further worth to gratify mine eye, And charm it still to hanker here below. No; I have seen, what I did live to see, The World's Hopes, and mine own, and here they be. 35 Dear Lord of Truth, here, here's that hop'd-for He In whom lie treasur'd Power and Salvation, Which now thy Love exposéd has to be The blessed Theme of humane Contemplation. All Eyes may see this Face, as well as I, And clearly read their own felicity. 36 This noble Face; by whose soul-piercing raies The Gentiles, quite dam'd up till now in night, Admonish'd are to understand their waies, And tread the open paths of highnoon Light; This Face, whose more than golden beauties be The glorious Crown of Jacob's Progeny. 37 Death, if thou dar'st draw near Life's blooming King, O take possession of my willing heart! That I, a swarthy and unworthy thing, From his too-radiant presence may depart. Too blest am I to live, and cannot bear The burden of this heav'nly Lustre here. 38 The good old Man thus eas'd his pious Zeal; And having sacrific'd a Kiss upon The Infant's royal foot, began to feel His Prayers were heard, and Death now drawing on: Which He to meet, went home, and order gave With sweet and hasty Joy, about his grave. 39 As his Devotion's faithful Echo, lo The venerable Matron Anna came; She whose prophetick heart advis'd her to Attend upon and magnify the same Young Son of Wonders; that her Sex in Her As his in Him, its duty might prefer. 40 And soon she met a full reward of all Those nights and days her fervor here had spent: Her Fasts were crown'd with Blisse's festival; Her longing Prayers which hence to heav'n she sent To pull it down, now found it ready here; For in the Infant's face it shinéd clear. 41 So clear, that truth admiring she could not Restrain her tongue from being Trumpet to The Dawn of such convincing Brightness, but Through Salem's longest streets resolv'd to go, Spreading her Proclamation to each ear And heart, which long'd that heav'nly News to hear. 42 This call'd so many wondring eyes to gaze On that pure Mother and her fairer Son, That from the glory of that populous Place To poor and private Nazareth she ran; Where, in her lowly house she hop'd to hide Her humbler self from Honor's growing tide. 43 But Honor scorns the zealous cunning chase Of most ambitious eager Hunters; and Persues those modest Souls from place to place By whom she sees her orient Presence shun'd: Nor is she e'r out run, or fails to raise Their Names with Trophies, and their brows with Bays. 44 But when in Salem this great News grew hot And flam'd to Herod's court; the Tyrant's Breast Boil'd high with rage, and vext suspicion that This fire might reach his Throne: which made him cast Deep, desperate counsels in his restless mind, For this bold Danger some stout Curb to find. 45 Mean while the Virgin, and her Husband, who In holy Innocence immuréd were, Attended their great Charge, and fearéd no Troublous assaults, or ambushes of fear. No Peril's so presumptious as to come Into their house, who had their God at home. 46 In this weak-wall'd but mighty Garrison They mean to rest, till sent by Heav'n away; On Heav'n's ingagéd Providence alone Dependeth both their Journy and their Stay: This Sentinel his watch exactly keep'd, And wak'd for them both when they wak'd and sleep'd. 47 Now therefore as in Slumber's arms they lay (For 'twas high midnight) Joseph's wingéd friend Rouzing his soul up by a mistic ray Bids him his speedy flight to Egypt rend; For Herod's spight contrives to slay, said he, The Infant, and in him thy Wife and Thee. 48 O that my wings might be his Chariot! but This noble Favour Heav'n reserves for thee, Fly then; but see thy self thou trouble not With thy Return; for when the Storm shall be Blown clearly over, I 'l not fail to come, And from thy God's own mouth recal thee home. 49 This said; his nearest way the Angel took Homewards, loud fluttering as he mounted up: The noise made Joseph start; who strait awoke; But his wing'd Monitor had gain'd the top Of heav'n, and in the spheres incloséd was E'r Joseph's following eye could thither press. 50 Yet by his blesséd influence left behind Th'instructed Saint the Spring intirely knew; The privileg'd eyes of his religious mind Had long acquainted been with Him, and now He doubts not but 'twas his dear Guardian, who Had taught him oft in straits what he should do. 51 Whilst by her sable curtains Night as yet Muffled up Heav'n, and kept the World in bed; Into his cloths he leap'd, and made all fit For his long journy: On the Ass he spread His Coverlet, and his best Pillow (sweet And cleanly hay) afforded him to eat. 52 The Beast thus baited; He his Axe, and Saws, His Planes, Rules, Mallets, and his other store Of busy honest Implements bestows Close in his Bag, the treasury of his poor Industrious subsistance; which he ties Fast to his staff, and on his shoulder tries. 53 Which done; two bottles (all the good man had) Fresh filléd at a neighbour fountain, he Hangs on his girdle, with his pouch of bread: With all things thus accouter'd, reverently He steppéd to the bed where Mary lay, Crying, Arise; Heav'n calleth us away. 54 When She the business heard, and saw how He Had all his honest sumpture ready made; Far be it, she reply'd, that I should be At any hour to follow Heaven afraid: Or loitering for the morning's light should tarry, Who in my arms my fairer Day shall carry. 55 I can be no where lost, dear Babe, while I Travel with Thee, who never canst depart From thine own home: so far thou canst not flie, But thine own Land will meet thee still, who art By thine eternal Right, the Prince as well Of Ham, and Egypt, as of Israel. 56 This untouch'd sacred bank for thy expence Th'Arabian Devotion meant not; but Thy Purveyor was thine own Providence: Thou knew'st what Charge this Journy would beget, And hast laid in Provision e'r we Could dream of any such Necessity. 57 And yet Necessity is no such thing To mighty Thee, whose all-commanding hand Governs the reins of Fate: the bloody King Musters his wrath in vain, would'st Thou withstand His spight in open field: but thou know'st why It will be now more glorious to Fly. 58 This Journy's but a step to Thee, who from The pinnacle of all Sublimity In my first Pilgrimage wert pleas'd to come And take up thy abode in worthless Me: Me, who from heav'n much further distant am Then Memphis is from fair Jerusalem. 59 This said; her nimble self she quickly drest, And by no Glasses, but her Son's pure eyes: Whose furniture strait in a bundle truss't Whilst to the Ass her careful Husband ties, She her own little All (and what was that, But one spare vail?) into her pocket put. 60 Then having wrap'd the Infant close, she took Her dull steed's back: whom leading by the rein Joseph, before the drowsy Town awoke Conducted out into the quiet Plain: Darkness and Silence clingéd round about, Barring Discovery and Suspicion out. 61 This early Master thus the noble Art Of Patience 'gan to teach his world below; To sanctify all Persecution's Smart, And make it by his owning glorious grow: Who but new-born, designéd is to die, And long e'r he can go, is fain to fly. 62 Aurora now the Porter of the day, Gat up and op'd her portal to the Sun; Who peeping out with an abaséd ray Beheld how far these Travellers had gone E'r he awoke, and doubted whither he Should in that day's horizon needed be. 63 For when he spy'd the Babe abroad, the sight Cost him a deeper blush than that which dyes His morning cheeks: yet up he cheer'd his light, And venturing on, resolv'd to try his eyes Upon that Infant-face of Splendidness, As Eaglets us'd to do their own at his. 64 Now loyal Love forbid that coily thou My Psyche shouldst disdain to trace their way, Since I so fair a Convoy thee allow Which neither dangers feareth nor delay: Thy God was glad of that poor Asse's back, But gives thee leave this Chariot to take. 65 That leave's too noble, she reply'd, for me, A meaner thing than what he rode upon; Might I on foot, or rather on my knee Crawle in his royal path, no Prince's Throne, Could tempt me from my greater honor:—'tis Enough said Phylax, now no more of this. 66 And here he snatch'd her up and shook the Reins: Which item strait the greedy coursers caught, And scouring through her soft aerial plains The fields of Nazareth to their prospect brought: Whose sudden face when Psyche view'd, she cry'd, How much thy steeds my swiftest thoughts outride! 67 O pity then thy Lord, said he, who though Spurr'd on by fear, was forc'd to use a pace Below the name of speed; whilst Joseph, who Himself was laden, leads the heavy Ass. He led him, and although he made no stay, Alas his very going was Delay. 68 For on his breast a thousand massy Cares More sadly sate, than on his back the load Of all his Tools: what thoughts of Herod's fears! What studies how to scape the ful-ey'd Road! What tenderness to keep the Mother warm! What dainty dread that God should take no harm! 69 For though he knew that Safety was ambitious In all their way to bear them company; Yet still he could not banish those delicious Assaults of tender loyal jealousy: And Love, when it has nothing else to fear, Suspects defect in its most careful care. 70 See'st thou that private Path, which ever since With Lilies and with Violets hath smil'd, Sweetly acknowledging the influence Both of the passant Mother and the Child? The Country wonder'd at the beauteous list, But from whose feet it sprung, they little wist. 71 As to the Sea the Silver River through A thousand bypathes steals its secret way; So doth this floury Tract to Egypt flow Declining all things that its course might stay. Doubt not the windings, but securely ride, For now the Way it self's thy fragrant guide. 72 Look how the Galilean Villages Their distance keep, and give the Path free leave To reach it self through these blind Privacies: Look how the friendly Trees all interweave Their arms, and offer close protection to Whoever here in secresy would go. 73 There did the careful Mother light, to give Her Son his diner from her lovely breast; Whom with right seemly welcome to receive Kind Earth those sweetly-swelling Cushions drest. Where'r you see th'officious flowers meet In such a junto, know it was her seat. 74 Mark yon neglected stable which is shut Quite out of town, and stand alone; with plain Yet courteous hospitable Litter, that Did these benighted Pilgrims entertain. They with such Lodging old acquaintance had; Remember what thy Lord his cradle made. 75 Joseph such wary Inns did duly chuse, And scap'd observance all the way he went: No eye of Galileans, or of Jews Discovering his provident intent. His way he stole with painful holy theft, And on his back at length Judea left. 76 He left Judea; but first left by it, Since to surprize his Charge, the bloody Prince His cunning tenter'd. Thus thy Spouse thought fit To teach his future Exiles, that the sense Of their sad suffrings sate full near his heart Who bore in Banishment so deep a part. 77 For this his Part he freely deign'd to bear, Not for his own, but for their dearer sake. Why then should they whose feeble Natures are Unable to resist, think much to make Necessity their Virtue, and be by Their Exile banish'd into Piety? 78 The freedom of the Reins here Phylax threw Upon his coursers' backs: who chearéd by That liberty, with sprightful fervor flew And scorn'd the Towns they saw beneath them lie. Their gallant foam they flung about the air, And with brave neighings heartned their carrier. 79 The Clouds took notice of their resolute haste And stepp'd aside to make their passage clear; Through which their smoking wheels whirl'd on as fast As Titan's down his glibbest steepest sphere: Which instantly so tir'd the Northern Wind, That puffing he and lagging came behind. 80 Thus having lost Judea in a mist Of far-removéd air, they rush'd into The famous Desert's unperceivéd List; Where their impatient fire still spurr'd them so, That thrice was Phylax forc'd to check them, e'r Their vehemence would yield his hand to hear. 81 And then; Consider Psyche well, said he, This squallid scene of churlish Desolation, This proper Region of Perplexity, This horrid Nursery of Desperation, This Storehouse of a thousand famins, this Fountain of Droughts, this Realm of Wretchedness: 82 This Country, whose ill-looking Neighborhood To Canaan (that widespred chanel where Honey and Milk conspir'd into a flood Of costless but incomparable cheer,) Doubles the value of that blesséd soil, And its own Vileness aggravates the while. 83 Thus sticks black Night as foil to beauteous Day, And by its blackness lends it fairer beams: Thus sorrow's stings inhance the sweets of Joy; Thus floods of Gall commend the Honey streams; Thus Darkness cleavéd close on Mirrours' backs, The most perspicuous Glass more lightsome makes. 84 Well knew wise Heav'n Men would not understand Its royal bounty, in affording them The gentle Riches of a fertile Land, Were they not tutor'd by some dreadful Clime Of bordering woes, and forced to confess A Garden's blessing by a Wilderness. 85 The prudent Lover to confirm the price Of her Affection thus sometimes is fain To run to cruel Art, and barbarize Her gentle Count'nance with severe Disdain; For she her wooer wooeth by this scorn, And only whipps him thus to make him learn. 86 Behold these needless Banks of sand, which have No Sea to limit but this Ocean Of Barrenness; where when the Winds conceive Highswoll'n displeasure, and to battle run Bandying their mutual Blasts a thousand ways, A storm of dry and parching rain they raise. 87 For this wild soil, impatient to be plow'd At Æolous' beck, in's face most madly flies, And climbing up into a tawny cloud With smoaking rage torments the stifeled skies. Whilst blinded Passengers amazéd stand, And all the Air is nothing else but sand. 88 This frighted gentler Nature far from hence, Who with her snatch'd her blessings all away; Her teeming Spring's delicious influence, Her Summer's beauties, and her Autumn's joy; And all the best of Winter too; for here This sandy Mischief scorcheth all the year. 89 The Trees, you see, are all dispers'd and fled For fear of proving only fuel here, And that before the Axe had summonéd Them to the hearth. The cheerly Birds which were Their boughs' Inhabitants, with doleful cry After their exil'd home were fain to fly. 90 These churlish Plains no entertainment keep Wherewith to welcome tame and honest Beasts; Goats, Asses, Camels, Horses, Oxen, Sheep Can at their wretchéd Table be no Guests. No; this is only Mischief's curséd Stage, Where Beasts of prey, and Monsters act their rage. 91 Observe that pair of couchant Tigres, who In cruel ambush lie to watch their prey; What boots the Traveller's one Life, when two Such wild and hungry Deaths beset his way! There runs a Lyon with his hideous note Tearing for want of meat his greedy throat. 92 At which dread business there's a female Bear In meat and drink two days and nights behind, Whose pinéd Whelps all yelling in her ear Chode her abroad some bootie's help to find. A headlong foaming Boar there makes his path White with the scum of his intemperate wrath. 93 But mark that Cave, before whose nasty door A heap of Excremental Poisons lies; Next which a Quakemire of congealéd Gore Rail'd round with naked staring Bones, descries What part fell Fury there hath plaid, and who Dwells in that House whose Porch is trim'd with woe. 94 That gloomy Cloud which dams the Den's black throat, Is but the Tenant's breath which dwells within. Our talk has wak'd his Rage, and made it hot With hopes of prey: hearst thou not him begin To rouse himself? the fire he spits before, Is but the Porter to unlock his door. 95 Here Psyche though she now had cheer'd her heart Beyond the pitch of female courage, yet Could not her trembling curb, but 'gan to start At that dire flame the belching Monster spit: When Phylax, smiling on her horror, cry'd, Fear not, for Heav'n and I am at thy side. 96 He of his coming, by his hideous Hiss Fierce warning gives; that stream of cole-black blood He spews so thick, his wonted Usher is: Thus when choice Furies break from hell, a flood Of stinking Sulphure paves their dismal way, Abashing all the Air, and pois'ning Day. 97 Lo how his Eyes, like two bright firebrands placed In cakes of blood, their fatal beams display; For thus, with flakes of glaring Rays enchased, To Heav'n's high Anger Comets light the way; Pointing with every beam, to Cities, or To Realms and Countries, Famine, Plague, and War. 98 His Mouth, which foams with venome, is the Gate Of helpless Misery; his Jaws, the Mill Of deplorable and untimely Fate; His Tongue, an Engine on whose forks there dwell A thousand Deaths; his Throat, so black and broad, To his unhappy Prey's the beaten Road. 99 His leathern Wings are those which lend its speed To dire Destruction: his iron Paws Are Spight's and Rage's hands; his curséd Head The Oracle whence Tyrants fetch their Laws; His scaly skin, the thick Embroidery Of proud and most remorsless cruelty. 100 His knotty Tail pointed with stinging fire, Which on his back in sullen scorn he throws, Is Death's dread Chain; that unrelenting ire Which sits so high on his large craggy brows, Is an aforehand bloody doom to all Beasts, Birds, or Men that in his clutches fall. 101 Hark how the bruséd Air complains, now he Threshes her with the Flails of his huge wings: For that soft Nymph elsewhere was us'd to be Beaten with Feathers, or melodious strings: Look in what horrid port he cuts the Clouds; The flame before, the smoke behind him crowds. 102 As when the martial Griffen hovers near, The greedy Kite forgets his chaséd prey, And turning partner in the Sparrow's fear Is glad as fast as she to sneak away: So here all other Monsters grant that this Their Sovereign in Rage and Terror is. 103 Thou now seest neither Lyon, Boar, nor Bear, This Dragon's presence frights them all away Into their closest Dens and Caverns, where They trembling lie, and durst not peep on Day. So do all other strange portentous things Hence storméd by the thunder of his wings. 104 For else thou here hadst troops of Centaurs seen, A mad composure of Horse-infantry: Else Sphinx and his ambiguous Brood, had been Abroad in all their forefront bravery, Indeavoring to excuse with Maiden-faces Their Beastly bodies' horrible disgraces. 105 Else had insatiable Harpies, their Near Cosen Portents in the wingéd crew, Boldly about this correspondent sphere With Virgin's looks, and Vulture's tallons flew: Frolick falacious Fauns had else been skipping, And Satyrs dallying here, and Silvans tripping. 106 Else had that Riddle of foul Ataxies Whose every part is placéd out of place, Who by a Goat's intruded belly ties A Dragon's vast tail to a Lyon's face; Rangéd about these Sands, and sought what Prey It's equal monstrous hunger might allay. 107 Hast thou not heard, when Abraham's Off-spring through The wholesome Tryals of this Wilderness Went to the well-deserving Promise, how They fondly murmuréd because Success Posted not on as fast as their desire, And though the way were short yet needs would tire? 108 They tir'd: though to encourage to the best Of patient strength their privilegéd hearts, Such Miracles combin'd as never blest The World till then: Heav'n's kindest stoutest Arts They by more obstinate shameless scorn neglected, And their obtruding Happiness rejected. 109 This forc'd the just Creator's strict Commission To Vengeance, his most trusty Factress; She Straight mounting on the back of Expedition, The World's black bottom plumm'd; where terribly The choisest Dens of Horror having ey'd, Into Erinnys grot she turn'd aside. 110 The Fury started; on her quaking head Right up stood every Snake: She ne'r till now Had seen a sight so full of fatal Dread, Though oft she view'd the deepest Deeps, and though She daily used for her looking-glasses Her correspondent Sisters' monstrous faces. 111 For in the Stranger's furrow'd brows were sown The seeds of everlasting Indignation; Her eyes were constant Lightning, flashing down Her fiery Cheeks, and with their sprightful motion Glancing a more than highnoon Day upon The frighted Night of that black Region. 112 Her sturdy breast was fram'd of burning brass; Her massy arms of sparkling steel; her more Than adamantine hands brandish'd a Mace Of red-hot iron; at her back she wore A quiver stuff'd with forkéd bolts of thunder Well-skill'd in tearing clouds and rocks in sunder. 113 Pain, Anguish, Groans, Astonishment, Despair, Dissention, Tumult, War, Plague, famin, Drought, Confusion, Poisnous and Tempestuous Air, Eversion, Desolation, Crying out, Gnashing of teeth, eternal-dying fear, Soule-knawing Worms, her dismal followers were. 114 And so was Schism, and flinty Obduration, With Pride, and Impudence in villany; And she who through her fairer garb and fashion Seem'd more to sute with lovely company, Was yet as rank a curse as they, for she Was blind and false though zealous Sanctity. 115 But Vengeance spying her Eyrinnys quake, Constrain'd her dreadful Aspect to remit Its awfulnesse's dint; and try'd to speak As mild as feirce she look'd: yet when she set Her Mouth's hot furnace ope, to all the Cave Loud Thunder notice of her speaking gave. 116 Fear not, said she, I on an errand come Which well will suit with thy revengeful thought: The Sons of Israel thou know'st with whom My Sovereign's Patience long, ah long, hath fought. 'Tis true he leads them through a barren Earth, Yet makes heav'n bring them bread of Angels forth. 117 But peevish they force Him by murmuring, to Repent his Kindness: wherefore thou must spare Some of thy Locks, which I am sent to throw About that Desert's now devoted Air; Where they shall lash the Rebels, till they see What 'tis to kick at God, and waken Me. 118 Me, whom soft Mercy long had stretchéd kept Upon a bed which she of Patience made: Me, who for ever might in peace have slept, Did Mortals not take pleasure in this trade Of sending up their shameless Sins, to tear By daring Crys my most unwilling ear. 119 Me, who ne'r mov'd this challeng'd Hand in vain, Nor knew what 'twas or stroke or aim to loose; Me, whom no Tune can charm asleep again, But dying Groans of those my head-strong Foes; Me, whose sure Power it self could deeply seal On Lucifer, and ram him down to hell. 120 Erinnys glad to hear this Message, tore Her hissing Hair by handfuls from her head: Which hasty Vengeance to this Desert bore And through the trembling air their volumes spread; First having breathéd on them warlike fire, Which kindled in their breasts mischievous Ire. 121 Th'amazed Element would fain have fled From all its Regions, to avoid this fight: The boldest Winds that ever bluster'd Dread About the World, were now a prey to fright; And to their furthest dens blowing themselves, Gave way to these far more tempestuous Elves. 122 Which were no sooner tosséd up, but they Their scantness felt increaséd round about; Their Tails reach'd back their stings an hideous way, And from their sides wide-threshing Wings burst out, Whose boistrous stroak provok'd the vexéd flames, Which from their eyes and mouths pour'd out their streams. 123 Their own instinct taught them the readiest way To find the causeless-rebel Multitude: Where seizing strait upon their helpless Prey Their fiery Poison's shot so thick they spew'd, That all the Camp had their Burntoffring been, Had seasonable Mercy not step'd in. 124 In Mercy step'd, and by a Contreplot A brasen Serpent rearéd up to heal Their burning Wounds whose faith had strength to put Trust in that typick Med'cin's Spectacle. They gaz'd, and saw their help, but could not pry Into the bottom of that Mystery. 125 That crucifyed Serpent represented Thy Spouse, when on his Cross he reign'd, and by His potent Dying gallantly prevented The Plot of Death which more than He did die. Who crush'd the old red Dragon which had hurl'd His deadly venome all about the World. 126 And now thou know'st the pedigree of this Feirce Portent which inflames and taints the air, Whose fiery looks and smoaking flight confess Of what Progenitors he is the Heir. Think now how sad a Pilgrimage it was When thy young Lord did through such Monsters pass. 127 Yet shall this hideous Region appear So precious unto future Saints, that they Will seek their harbour no where else but here, And make these Sands the shore where they will lay Their Vessels safe from all those Storms, whose rage Revels on secular Life's unfaithful stage. 128 His Pilgrimage they'l judge a Dedication Of all this Tract to holy Privacy; Where in serene and heav'nly Contemplation They shall both sweetly live, and sweetlyer die: Dreading no longer other Monsters, when They once have rescued themselves from Men. 129 Men, Men, those Portents are, whom wiser fear More dangerously pois'nous will esteem Than that fire-breathing Brood who in the sphere Of this vast desert move like Mars his flame. Men are those Dragons whose profounder art Stings not the body, yet can bane the heart. 130 Here they their Cels will build so strongly mean That they shall Tempest scorn, and laugh at Plunder; Here they as fresh and strong, as pale and lean, Will raise their souls and keep their bodies under. Here they will importunéd Earth intreat With Herbs or Roots to gratify their Sweat. 131 For neither stubborn flint nor sapless Sand Their Barrennesses' privilege will dare Strictly to urge against the painful Hand Of pious Poverty: such Charters are Of Nature's granting, and must needs give place Unto the grand Prerogative of Grace. 132 Here will their Eyes not interrupted be With fond Allurements of the newest fashions; Whose Commendation speaks their Vanity, Their Worth being only built upon Mutations. Their simple Sackcloth in one cut and guise To hide their Dust and Ashes will suffice. 133 Here shall no Noise of chincking Money be Rebounded by their Heart's inchanted strings; That Noise which with melodious Witchery Through all the World's unhappy Quarters rings, And gains more Altars for vile Mammon than To glorious Heav'n will be allow'd by Men. 134 Here shall no glancing Eye, no mincing Pace, No sporting Locks, no smiling Red and White, No wanton Dress, no Tongue's Sirenian Grace, No bidding Coyness, no inviting flight; Prevail upon their manly hearts to brook The tickling Slavery of a Woman's yoke. 135 Here no Ambition's Puff shall swell their breast And in their soul a foolish Dropsy raise; Who by themselves are freely dispossest Of all those gardens which can bring forth bays; And live upon a Soil which nothing bears But Poverty, and Roots, and Sighs, and Tears. 136 No terrible Alarm of War shall here Ravish the sweetness of their virgin Quiet: Heer none of Mars his boistrous Crew shall swear Themselves into authority to riot; Nor make the Lords of these poor houses be The subjects of free-quarter's Slavery. 137 Here shall no specious Care of Wife and Child Call them away in conscience from their Prayers: By Virtue's daily Progress they shall build Up to the gate of Bliss their mystick stayers; And thus a second time the World shall leave, Nobly to Heav'n rebounding from their grave. 138 But now this long Discourse devouréd had The longer Way, and Egypt's face drew near; Thebai's Meads and Woods and Towns were glad That to the Desert they next neighbours were; And privileg'd these Strangers first to meet And with kind seasonable Welcome greet. 139 When, Lo said Phylax, now the World grows tame, And mild and hospitable Prospects yields: These are the outmost skirts of populous Ham Lufted with Woods, and lac'd with floury fields: A dear-earn'd harbour to those Pilgrims who Have labour'd through this Desert's Sea of Woe. 140 Thus at the headland's close wish'd Rest attends And home the weary Plowman gently leads. Thus hang the Garlands at the Race's ends Ready to crown the Runners' sweaty heads. Thus Summer cheers the pinéd Earth, when she Has pass'd through Winter's total Tyranny. 141 The second Joseph hither came, and brought Far more Salvation than the First; although From Famin's Jaws He snatchéd Egypt out, And fatnéd up seav'n starvéd years; for now To famish'd Memphis this convey'd the bread By which the World eternally is fed. 142 O how he triumph'd that his Charge was here Arrived safe through all those perillous ways! Upon the Child he look'd, but through a Tear Of passionate Joy, and pay'd their Safetie's praise To Him, whose Providence had in that wide Kingdom of Dangers to his Guides been Guide. 143 And thus advancing to that City there, Surnam'd Hermopolis in compliment To ancient Herme's Lasting honor; near That fairly-tall religious Tree he went: The Natives call it Persea, and with high Esteem its Leaves and Apples magnify. 144 Observe them well: each leaf presents the true Shape of a Tongue; whose secret whispers treat With every Wind: the dangling Apples shew The feature of a panting Heart. O that The World would learn this lesson of the Tree, That with the Tongue the Heart should joynéd be! 145 Blind Superstition's Rites had hallow'd it To Isi's honor; but the honest Tree Made bold that fond Relation to forget When thy great Spouse approach'd: for instantly With orthodox devotion pliant grown Low on the earth her head she bowéd down. 146 Where she with all her hearts the Babe ador'd, And did her best with all her tongues to sound His praise, who is of hearts and tongues the Lord: Then having with her boughs clean swept the ground, She rose and gave him way; yet out she stretch'd Her neck, and after him her arms she reach'd. 147 When lo, as near the City gate he drew, Isis, (of stupid marble made, and there Fix'd wisely on a Base which was as true And as divine a Stone as she;) with fear And awe surpriséd, 'gan at first to quake And then to bend, and then right down to break. 148 Poor Idol! who had never Sense till now, And now feels only her own ruin: down Tumbles the long-adoréd Goddess Cow; Resigning that high worship to her own True Lord, which she had long usurpéd by The help of Egypt's mad Idolatry. 149 Her fair-spred Horns are shatter'd, bruis'd her brow, Her broken neck mix'd with her crumbled feet: The Deity advanc'd to Rubbish now Has power to help the Country, if in thick And mirey ways dispos'd: which sure is more Assistance than it e'r could lend before. 150 Thus when the reverend Ark of God was set In Dagon's temple, down the Idol fell, And at the door too hasty out to get, Quite broke his Godship on the stronger Sell; Where his amaz'd Devotos entring, found The wretchéd fish in its own ruins drown'd. 151 But in the City's (and the People's) heart Upon a golden column mounted high And deck'd with all the wit and pride of Art Serapis stood; the Ox of Majesty; Whose consecrated Crown about his wide And mighty Horns wreath'd its triumphant pride. 152 Through that Piazza as these Pilgrims went Seeking their Inn, the guilty trembling Beast His steely knees and brazen body bent, And by his massy weight so strongly cast Himself down headlong, that into an heap Of fragments from his Godhead he did leap. 153 The dismal Crack of this strange ruin's thunder Alarm'd all Ears and Bosoms of the town; Quite shattering their brittle souls in sunder, Who thought the next fall needs must be their own. For now alas it was their deepest dread That they themselves should like their God be made. 154 But though blind They could not the truth descry, Wise Joseph and his virgin Consort knew To what more powerful Divinity The Idol his obeisance prostrate threw: What pointed out by Essay's Pen had been To entertain Faith's prospect, they had seen. 155 There had they seen, how into Egypt, on A speedy Cloud thy spouse should ride; and how Th'ashaméd Idols into dust should run From his dread Presence: and they plainly now Found that his Mother's bosom was the Cloud Where in his flight he pleas'd himself to shroud. 156 Good Joseph therefore posted up and down The ruin of Idolatry to spread Through every populous superstitious Town Which deify'd the hornéd Statues: Sad And troubled was his righteous Soul to see That men should more than marble stupid be. 157 And wheresoe'r on Zeal's stout wings he flew Equal Success still bore him company: Th'infernal Spirits still their Lodgings threw In pieces, as thy mighty Lord drew nigh. Thou shalt no further go; but I will tell Thee here, what Wonders afterward befell. 158 The heart of Egypt melting down her breast, As from their Pillars her vain Gods had done; The Priests and sage Magicians broke their rest To find this Prodigy's occasion: And all at common Council met one night, Resolv'd to try their Spell's profoundest might. 159 Jannes, a wretch both of his race and name Who vainly tugg'd with Moses' strength, began: 'Twas in a vault where Day's looks never came; A vault untroad by any mortal Man Who was not full as black as they, and made Solemnly free of their accurséd Trade. 160 The Door of Iron once, but now of Rust, With nine huge barrs he fortifies; yet still Unwilling nine Securities to trust, Each barr he fastens with a charméd Seal. Fond Wizzard! who by every one of them Either his fear lays open, or his shame. 161 In this deep Temple of Infernal Arts Lighting a Taper temper'd with the fat Which grew about his Predecessors' hearts, It in a dead Man's Mossy skull he set. The Mists and Stincks long wrestléd with the flame Before the vault laid ope its naked shame. 162 Then gaping wide both with his mouth and eyes, He spew'd seav'n solemn Curses on Day-light; Which though it saw the broken Deities, Would not detect what sacrilegious Might That ruin wrought: and then those Gods he blest Whose luck it was in gloomy holes to rest. 163 For on a shrine still-standing there appear'd Serapis, Isis, and a smoaky rout Of lesser Gods: the altar was besmear'd With bloody gore; and scatter'd round about In reaking fragments lay Cheeks, Noses, Eyes, Hearts, Shoulders, Livers, Legs, Arms, Bowels, Thighs. 164 These hideous dainties was the breakfast for A Crocodile, whose sacred den was there; But tam'd by strong enchantments, durst not stir When in their Magick bus'nesse's carreer The Priests were hot: no Monster but compar'd With raving Them, serene and mild appear'd. 165 The Walls with Leeks and Onyons garnish'd were; For courteous Egypt Gods had made of these, And from her well-dung'd soil reap'd every year A worthy Crop of young fresh Deities. Nile on the roof by Paint was taught to flow, That God whose bounty makes those other grow. 166 But Jannes having now thrice wash'd his Hand And stain'd with it that Stygian Ink which stunk In his black Laver; up he takes his Wand, That Wand which once liv'd on a cypress Trunk Planted on Acheron's bank, but now was made The deadly Scepter of their conjuring Trade. 167 A Scepter unto which the Moon, the Sun, The Stars, had often stoop'd, and Nature bow'd: Oft had it turn'd the course of Phlegeton, Oft had it troubled Hell, and forc'd the proud Tyrant, for all his Iron Mace, to be Obedient to its wooden Witchery. 168 With that a Circle on the floor he draws (Spred thick with ashes stoll'n from funeral piles) Which with strange Lines, and Hooks, and Forks, and Claws, And scrambling frantick shapeless shapes he fills: Wild Hieroglyphicks, stark-mad Characters, A jumbled Rout of snarl'd illfavor'd Jars. 169 Into this hell of scratches in step'd He (A seemly Actor for that scene,) and there Three groans he gave; three times he bow'd his knee; He thrice with blood besprinkled his left ear; Three times he mumbled over those profound Monsters his Wand had written on the ground. 170 As oft he spit, as oft his lips he bit; And every time chew'd sullen detestation And silent blasphemy against the great Monarch of heav'n; whose jealous indignation Of Rival Powers made him suspect that He Was guilty of the Gods' Calamity. 171 Then lifting up his hollow voice, he cry'd, By Jannes, Jambres, (our renownéd Sires,) And Pharoh's adamantine Soul, which try'd A fall with Israel's God; by all those Fires We on your Altars kindled have, and them Which with black Styx or Erebus mingled swim. 172 By these profound mysterious Notes which I Have figur'd here; by dread Tisiphone; By stern Alecto, and Megera; by Huge Cerberus his head's triplicity; By Hell's wide Gates; and by the most divine Scepters of Pluto and of Proserpine: 173 By your own Heads, who here alone have your Safe sanctuary found: I you conjure Serapis, Isis, and each lesser Power, No longer your Dishonour to indure. What boots it here to be a standing God, And in Scorn's publick eye fall down abroad? 174 For from Hermopolis's unfortunate gate Ruin advanc'd, and boldly made her prey On every Deity whose curséd fate It was to stand in her devouring way. Whence comes this Downfal of Religion? what Has spread amongst the Gods this deadly Rot? 175 Let me but know, and Heav'n I'l force to bow And kiss the feet of Hell: the Center I Will in the face of scornful Phebus throw And at high-noon with Midnight choak the sky: But I your Quarrel will revenge, and make Your secret theevish foe in public quake. 176 His mouth the coal-black foam here stoping, He With grezly ghastly face, with staring eyes, With breast tormented by anxiety, With languid arms and hands, with quivering thighs; Expects his mighty Charm's Result to see, And what his Oracle's Reply would be. 177 When lo (for then thy Spouse was drawing nigh, That very place,) a groaning horror shak'd The mourning Vault, which was rebounded by So strong an earthquake, that the Idols crack'd, And by their prostrate fragments in the Cave Turn'd their own Temple to their fitter Grave. 178 Scarcely had Jannes and his frighted Crew Time to escape the Ruin of their Gods: But being out, their Indignation threw Their Books away, and brake their fruitless Rods; And having nothing else whereon to pour Their spight, their flesh they rent, their hair they tore. 179 His secret Vengeance thus thy little Lord Sheath'd in the bowels of Idolatry; Whilst puzled Egypt felt the conquering Sword, But could not its mysterious Victor see. The Angel thus of old their First-born slew, When undiscernéd through that Land he flew. 180 Mean while fell Herod rack'd his busy brain About his Master-piece of Tyranny: The dull-ey'd Vulgar never could attain To read its Hatching and Nativity, For it was bread as low as hell: but I To thee will ope this blackest Mystery. 181 Mischievous were that Prince's Counsels: but Proud Lucifer had deeper plots than He, More jealous of his Crown than Herod, at The new-born King's high-fam'd Discovery: For in his ears the Shepherd's Story rung, And that stronge musick of the Christmas Song. 182 The angry mouth of thunder never spoke Such terror to his Soul as those soft Notes; Which tun'd to Joy's mild key, divinely broke Out from the nests of those sweet Angels' throats. Nor was this Omen all: for he had spy'd That eastern Star, the Wisemen's wiser Guide. 183 No light did ever fright him so, but that Whose Darts down headlong shot him from the top Of heav'n's sublimest pinnacle, and shut Him up in deepest Night; that damnéd shop, Where 'twas his trade Sin's cheating Wares to sell To those who with thir Souls would purchase hell. 184 But now he fear'd this trade would never thrive, And that few Chapmen would delight to buy, So long as that great Infant was alive; With whose more profitable Deity Shepherds and Kings to traffick had begun, And taught the World which way for Gains to run. 185 Especially since his dear Egypt now Was likely to revolt, and pay no longer Homage to any gilded Ox or Cow: Since valiant Jannes yielding to a stronger Charm than his own, had forfeited the fame Of Hell, and quite betrayéd Magick's name. 186 Ten thousand spawns of his perplexéd brain He tumbles o'r, yet none could please his eye; Again he chooses and dislikes again; But vows at last howe'r, thy Spouse shall die. He vows by his own head, and seeks some Fiend To whom the desperate work he might commend. 187 A Rock there stands on dire Cocytus's bank Which to the River opes its monstrous Jaws, Content to suck no breath but what the rank And sulphury Vapour of that water throws Into its Mouth; which far more venomous makes The steaming Poisons that from thence it takes. 188 In winding holes and ragged corners there Whole Families of Adders, Vipers, Snakes, Asps, Basilisks, and Dragons dwelling are; Whose constant and confounding Hissing makes The language of that Mouth dreadfully tell What Prodigies in Hell redouble Hell. 189 The Throat sticks thick with bones of legs and arms, Which ravenous Haste left stinking by the way. The Stomack (Murder's Sink and Dungeon) swarms With heaps on which Digestion could not prey: At whose unfadomable Bottom reaks Young guiltless Blood in Vengeance-daring Lakes. 190 But at the Cavern where the Heart should lie Was hung a sevenfold Gate of massy brass, Plated with Adamant, and conjur'd by A thousand bolts and locks, to let no cross Mischance peep in; besides, as many Seals Treading on one another's crowded heels. 191 High in the Tower above, at windows close Lattis'd with Steel, stood Lynxes night and day: An hundred Dogs lay at the threshold, whose Quick ears no Sleep could ever steal away. Next them as many Cocks; and next to these A vigilant Company of trusty Geese. 192 Within lurk'd dark Meanders, damméd up By frequent doors, and Porters too, whose chief Office it was to keep them lock'd, and stop Ev'n Thought it self from playing there the thief. Their lights they oft put out, for fear some sly And cunning Beam a cranny might espy. 193 The Walls were circled by a mighty Moat, The Palace far from Danger to divide: No bridge it knew, and but one single Boat In which no more than one at once could ride; And this the timorous Shores close Pris'ner was, Under a chain of steel and lock of brass. 194 On all which Shore in due array were set With weapons ready drawn, three careful Watches, That no Disturbance might presume to put Its finger forth, or touch the jealous Latches: For with a loud alarm they rouséd were If but the Image of a Noise came there. 195 But in that House, so dark and so profound, That fair and high it made the rest of Hell; A Thing O how much more than Monster, drown'd Yet deeper in self-torturings, chose to dwell. One who espous'd Disquiet for her Rest, One who all furies is to her own breast. 196 Suspicion's her just name; thick set's her head With thoughtful Eyes, which always learing seem, And always ghastly; for they trust no Lid To interpose twixt Lassitude and them. On Sleep they look as on some treacherous thing Hatching blind Dangers under his black wing. 197 But principally they at one another Their anxious and misgiving glances throw; And if no grounds of fear they thence can gather, Of deeper Dangers therefore fearful grow. Yet whilst they all thus mutually stare, Each bids his brother of himself beware. 198 Her sharp thin ears stand always prick'd upright To catch all Sounds and Whispers that come near. Sometimes as her own Fancy took its flight But through her head, she thought some Noise was there. Her hollow Cheeks had gapéd long for meat, But doubts and fears forbad her still to eat. 199 She dream'd in every Dish and Cup she saw Some slie and deadly Poison's Ambushment. Alas, and how could any venome grow So venomous as she, who might have lent New power to Dragons' stings, and taught each field Of Thessaly crops of surer bane to yield. 200 Impenetrable Steel her Garments were, All of the temper of great Satan's shield: Her hands allarméd by perpetual fear A mighty Sword and brazen Buckler held: Weapons with which she never durst intend To fight, but only her own head defend. 201 Fast stood her Chair on forty iron feet, And to the ground all double nail'd; yet she Could not believe but underneath her seat Some treasonable Mine might lurking be. This made her seldom sit; and when she did, Over her shoulder still she turn'd her head. 202 No morning pass'd but some on work she set New Keys to make her; being jealous still Her foes might patterns of her old ones get; And twenty times as much she chang'd her Seal: As her own self she would have done, had she Known how to alter her Deformity. 203 With contradicting thoughts her brain was beat, Which were no sooner liked but rejected: She weigh'd and boulted every Counsel, yet What surest seem'd to be she most suspected. Oft would she skip, and fling about, and start, And meerly at the motion of her heart. 204 Ten times an hour her Pulse she duly try'd, Doubting as often what its working ment: Sometimes she thought she felt too high a Tide, Sometimes too low an Ebb of blood: Content She never was, yet sought no Physick's aid, Of Sickness and of Cure alike afraid. 205 An Oath of strict Allegiance thrice a day She forcéd on her numerous Family; And weekly chang'd their Offices, that they Might have no time to ripen Treachery. Strange Officers, yet fitting to attend So sovereignly-odious a Fiend. 206 The first was tall and big-bon'd Cowardize Whose lazy Neck on her fat shoulders lay; Her gross head screen'd by both her hands; her eyes Horribly winking, at the dint of Day; Her ears as flat as dread could lay its prize; Her sneaking tail hid 'twixt her shivering thighs. 207 The next, stern Cruelty supported by Advantage and Revenge; prime Enginere To all the Generals of Tyranny. What Whips, what Racks, her fell Inventions were, What broad Perfidiousness, what groundless Wars, What Insultations, and what Massacres! 208 Close in the corner stood pale Thoughtfulness, Seald on whose lips regardless Silence sate: Her business was a thousand things to guess; She stamp'd, her head she scratch'd, her breast she beat, Her wearied eyes she nailéd to the ground, And in her endless self her self she drown'd. 209 About the room ran furious Discontent, And when all other scap'd her causeless war, She wag'd it with her self; her cloaths she rent, Her cheeks she gash'd, and madly tore her hair. But Malice slyly crept, and dealt her spight To friends and foes in a concealéd fight. 210 Yet slippery Guile was nimbler then the rest, Whose quaint attire was of Chamelions' skins; Who in two minutes could become at least An hundred Virtues, and as many Sins: She Polypus in feet outvy'd, and was Fortune's true Echo, Proteus' Looking-glass. 211 Her mate was complemental flattery, Whose mouth's rich mine bred more than golden words; Her hand she always kiss'd, and bent her knee, Whilst in her mantle lurk'd two pois'ned swords. These were the courtiers, and of their condition A thousand more who waited on Suspicion. 212 When Lucifer had rakéd many Dens And found no fury who so furious was As his new-bru'd Design; at last he runs To this foul sink: where when his sulphury face The flashing Tokens of his presence threw, The rouzéd Grot its awful Sultan knew. 213 The Boat flew from its chain to meet his feet, And wast him over to the privy Watch; Whose swords fell down, whose hands went up, to greet Their Sovereign's coming and to draw the latch. Suspicion started as they op'd the door, Wondring her Mastiffs barkéd not before. 214 But dread and awe had stopp'd their mouths; as now They sealéd Hers, to see grim Lucifer: She fear'd the worst, and thought that in his brow She read some deep-writ lines of spight to her. But from his face he wip'd the fire and smoke, And with a Kiss's preface, thus he spoke. 215 Madam, be not afraid, for well I know My friends, and thee as best of them esteem; Witness that precious trust my love will now Treasure in thee; it is my Diadem: My Diadem is lost if thou dost not Procure Destruction to Mary's Brat. 216 Herod will do his best, I ken him well, If aided by thy desperate Inspiration: There's not a heart that lives, where more of Hell Hath taken up its earthly habitation. O had I store of such Viceroys as He To rule my Earth, how Heav'n would baffled be! 217 Yet Herod's but a Man; and should he stand On foolish points of nice Humanity, That Brat, by being such, might scape his hand. But if his strength with thine thou backest, He Will quickly grow most salvagely complete, And bravely venture on the barbarous feat. 218 Nor need'st thou any Maid but Cruelty To dress thy Project; take her then and go: Fetch but that Baby-God's heartblood for me, And with a Crown I'l raise thy worthy brow, Mounting thee on an everburning throne Where thou shalt reign Queen of Perdition. 219 Glad was the Hagg to hear the business, and Promis'd her Lord all develish faith and care: Who clapping on her head his sooty hand, Cry'd, take Hell's blessing with thee; O my Dear Success attend thy Loyalty, and may Heav'n's envious Tyrant not disturb thy way. 220 Forthwith her path through Asphaltite's Lake She tore, and in the middle boyléd up: The sulphure trembled, and the banks did shake, Down to the bottom fled the frighted top; That most victorious Stink which till to day Dwelt there, her stronger Breath blew quite away. 221 Deep Horror all the Elements did seize, And taught the rest, as well as Earth, to quake. Blasting deflour'd the Meadows and the Trees; Her noise made Ghosts of thousand Witches wake, Ill-boding Nightrav'ns croke, shrill Scritchowls squeak, Hogs whine, dogs houl, Snakes hiss, and mandrakes shriek. 222 Men, Beasts, and Birds fled from her frightful face; And Heav'n it self would fain have run away Had it but known to what retiring place Its now too vast Expansions to convey. Yet Phebus made a shift to lurk and croud His eyes behind the curtain of a cloud. 223 But when she mark'd how Nature fear'd her look, So to be seen she was as much afraid; For in Invisibilitie's sly cloke Stealing to Herod's Court (where Care had laid The Tyrant fast asleep) into his breast Her Consort and her damnéd self she thrust. 224 As when a viper squeas'd into his wine By Treason's hand deceives an heedless King, About his Soul the poison's powers twine, And with a war of Pangs his entrails wring: So did these Monsters with tempestuous smart Rage in the bowels of fell Herod's heart. 225 Dark dreadful fancies, and self-thwarting Cares Worry'd his breast, and chas'd sleep from his eyes: For up he starts, his grezly beard he tears, And round about his chamber cursing flies: He curs'd himself, and Heav'n, and all its Stars, But chiefly that which pointed out his fears. 226 Squander'd have I, said he, my time till now On petty bus'ness, whilst my Crown and Head Lie at the stake! have I let treason grow And gather strength, upon my Life to tread! Fy Herod, fy! wert thou that wary He Whom fame extoll'd for sharp-ey'd Policy. 227 What stupor made thee suffer those bold Kings Who blaz'd the Birth of that Jessean Prince, To prate in Salem of such dangerous things? Hadst thou not fire and sword to chase them thence? Could not that flaming Steel have shinéd far More potently than their enchanting Star. 228 And could thy Kingdom, and thy larger wit With other Messengers not furnish thee, Whose loyal Cruelty might have been fit To bear a death-designing Embassy; But on thy errand thou thy foes must send And whilst thou hat'st thy Rival, him befriend? 229 But due to thee is every fury's sting For trusting their bare word for their Return. Ar't Herod still, both Crafts' and Jewries' King, Who by thy Brain didst for thy Temples earn The Crown they ware! and canst thou cosen'd be By three old doting Men's poor subtility! 230 See now how well thy credulous Courtesy Repayéd is: Those Kings the News have spread Through all the Regions of wide Araby; Which joyn'd in Zeal's bold League, have made an head To tear fool'd Herod from his throne, and set That Infant, as a wiser Prince, on it. 231 Me thinks I smell the Battel drawing near, And Vengeance aiming at my careless Brain; Me thinks the thunder of their Arms I hear, And see the Lightning flashing on the plain; Loud in mine ears, me thinks, the name doth ring, The shouted Name, of Israel's newborn King. 232 The Priests' falsehearted pack will strait comply With those new Powers against despiséd Me; And triumph that their reverend Prophesy In my dethroning they fulfilléd see. My Idumean Stock too well they know, And much ado I had to make them bow. 233 As for the giddy Multitude, whom I Have squeas'd with my oppressing Taxes' load; All change to them will seem felicity, But most, if baited with the Name of God. And when Religion calls to Innovation, What banks can curb a popular Inundation! 234 The Cause, the Cause, however causeless, will Fire them to such a prodigality Ev'n of their blood, that they their lives will spill In hopes that Dying, yet they shall not die; And turning Superstition's maddest slaves, Trust They shall prove immortal in their Graves. 235 My Nobles all will this advantage take Longing to serve some gentler Prince than I; Good Lands have They to loose, for whose dear sake Bidding farewel to costly Loyalty, They'l to the stronger Eastern Armies run, And idolize with them the Rising Sun. 236 'Tis true, Heav'n's over all; but I confess 'T has often vex'd me that it should be so; And since my stomach thus against it rise, What hopes from thence of friendly succours to Distresséd Herod! No the case is plain: Write him for foe, on whom y'have thrown Disdain. 237 Much Gold, I grant, I on the Temple spent; But in devotion solely to my own Adoréd Ends; (the only true Intent Of Politicians' zeal:) And well 'tis known, For all my mask of Jewish Piety, My aim was always mine own God to be. 238 None have I left to trust, but only Thee, O thou my high, and once heroick Heart! Why may not some Exploit of Cruelty Above example rais'd, force fate to start? Why may not Herod's Sword cut out that leaf Of Destiny which has enroll'd his Grief. 239 It must, and shall be so: I will not own A Tyrant's Name for nothing. Let the Head Of Cesar wear the World's Imperial Crown With love and gentleness embellishéd: It shall my manly Glory be, to write Sovereign of Rage, and Emperour of spight. 240 And let Heav'n's Monarch thank himself, if I Torment him with a stronger Sin than yet Earth in his scornéd face e'r taught to fly. Who bid Him wake my fears? who bid him set An ominous Comet to outstare my Rest, And light War's journy hither from the East? 241 From two years old, and under, every Brat That sucks in Bethlehem, and its confines, breath, Upon the altar of my royal Hate Shall sacrificéd be: and if no Death Amongst all those can find my Rival's heart, Then let him scape; I shall have done my part. 242 But sure it cannot miss: and then I wonder, What can the vain Arabian forces do! If their foundation once be split in sunder, Their Building needs must stoop to ruin too. If I their Infant in his bud can crop, Surely the dangerous Weed will ne'r grow up. 243 'Twill never grow to taint the Paradise Of my Content; which cheer'd and fatnéd by This hostile blood, may venture to despise Earth's strongest cunningest Conspiracy; And laugh at frustrate Heav'n; no Star from whence Shall dazel any more my Confidence. 244 This said; he nods his special Secretary; (An Engine rarely qualify'd to stand At fiercest Satan's elbow,) who right merry To hear his barbarous Sovereign's sad Command, The black Commission writ, which was to be In blood transcribéd by the Soldiery. 245 For Herod kept an arméd Crew, which He With cruel care and cost had pick'd and chose From Idumea, Scythia, Barbary; Men ruder than their Homes; professéd foes To all humanity; their looks of Brass, Their hands of steel, their heart of marble was. 246 As practis'd Tigres in the Theatre Let loose to their own keen and hungry spight, With dreadful joy haste to their wishéd War; Where with their murderous looks the slaves they fright Out of their lives, then with their teeth they tear And slay again what first they kill'd by fear. 247 These bloodier Caytiffs so to Bethlehem ran With swords and faulchions arm'd, and with their more Inhumane weapon, their Commission, Counting Delay their torture: with a Roar The Town they enter'd, which alarming Thunder With Dread smote all the People's hearts in sunder. 248 Strait in the Name of awful Herod they Proclaim'd their office was, a List to take Of all the Infants which from such a Day In Bethlehem and its coasts were born; for lack Of punctual appearance, threatning wrath To every Mother, to each Infant death. 249 These Summons through the Town and Country flew; And when the next Day's Sun had reach'd his height Into the Market every Mother drew, Who in her bosom lagg'd her sucking weight: A sight which might all Beasts unbarbarize, Yet mov'd no pity in these Soldiers' eyes: 250 Who guards at every corner having set, With all extremities of salvage rage Their monstrous Charge in execution put. Great Titan's eye ne'r yet beheld a stage So red with Tragedies, nor Hell set forth In Pageants so portentuous on earth. 251 In vain the lamentable Mothers' Cries, And Tears, and Prayers, and shrill Expostulations, Mix'd with their Infants' shrieks; in vain the skies And stones they rent with ruful Exclamations. For still the unrelenting Soldiers' ear Nothing but Herod's fell Command would hear. 252 Their preys they by the arm, or leg, or head, From their soft native Sanctuaries tore; Whose blood as in that barbarous strife they shed, They daub'd the Mothers with the Children's gore; And in their face their bowels threw, and sware, And curs'd, and hollow'd, and amaz'd the air. 253 The Townsmen, who this Massacre beheld Could lend no aid to Babes' or Mothers' Cry; By stiff astonishment some being kill'd, Others by cruel fear inforc'd to fly; Not knowing but the Soldiers' dire Commission Might add the Fathers to the Child's perdition. 254 Here Sarah kiss'd an arm, Rebecca there A leg; all that was left of either's Son: Rachel's impatient lamentation here Defy'd all powers of Consolation, She having but two mangled hands to show Of those sweet Twins which suck'd her breast but now. 255 Thus this most harmless flock of tender Lambs An heap of fragments suddenly became; Their milky fleeces, and their whiter Names Being dyed deep in ruby Martyrdom. Thus fruitful Rama now made childless, mourn'd; Thus all the Market was to shambles turn'd. 256 One Nurse was there, who when the Soldier caught Her precious Charge's throat, cry'd out, Beware, 'Tis Herod's, Herod's Son; and if you doubt, An hundred Witnesses are ready here. She cry'd; but e'r sh' had pronounc'd that word, The Infant's heart was bleeding on the sword. 257 Talk not of Herod's Son, but Herod's Will, Reply'd the Ruffian: though your tale were true, And no fond tender-hearted Lye; yet still This wound to that babe's heart I'm sure was due. The King shall answer't: 'tis sufficient that He knows why He his Son excepted not. 258 Thus provident Vengeance met the Tyrant in The forefront of his Crime, whilst blinded by His hasty fears, his fury he began At his own bowels: Herod's Son must die, And Heav'n's escape, although for Him the Net Of that wide-spred Destruction was set. 259 And this, when fame at Rome the Slaughter toll'd And Cesar's ear with just amazement fill'd; Made him cry out, O how much rather would I be the Hog of Herod than the Child. But Cesar dream'd not what that Infant gain'd, Nor that more than himself thenceforth he reign'd. 260 These roseal Buds of early Martyrdom Transplanted were to Paradise; and there Beyond the reach of Herod's rage, became Flowers of Eternal bliss, whose Temples are Imbrac'd with crowns of joy, whose hands with palms, Whose eyes with beams, whose tongues are fill'd with Psalms. 261 Nor do they only live and flourish there, But gloriously verdant are below: For in the Church's sacred Garden, where In Festival's fair bed's Renown doth grow, Their annual Memory revives, and in December's whitest frost is fresh and green. 262 But when the Bloodhounds back to Herod went, And brandish'd on their stainéd Swords the sign Of their own guilt: the sight with high content Tickled their Sovereign's hopes that his divine Rival was now dispatch'd, and that his Crown In spight of all Arabia was his own. 263 Yet sure to make 't (for in damn'd Tytius' breast More restlessly his Vulture ne'r could knaw Than torturing Doubts in Tyrants' bosoms feast:) The Jews he summons by a rigid Law Without the least exception to swear Allegiance both to Him and to his Heir. 264 Alas he little thought his slaughter'd Son Was now a stronger foe than all the Bands Of Araby, his own Suspition Had arm'd against himself; or that his hands And brains were both too weak to stand a fight With Bethlehem's massacred Infants' Might. 265 For now their Blood to righteous Heav'n sent up A louder Cry than their sad Mothers' Moan: Nor doth the great Creator's Justice ope A readyer ear to any Plaintiff's Groan, Than unto this; Though sure Mortality On Man attends, Man's Blood can never die. 266 Next neighbour to the Dead Sea's pois'nous shore Frowneth a gloomy Grove, where cheerly Day Could ne'r find room to shew her face, such store Of Cypress, Box, and Yew, damm'd up her way; Whose fatal boughs impeopled were with fowles Of nature sutable, Batts, Ravens, and Owles. 267 Besides, a Mist of Stincks makes bold to stick Close on the wretchéd Air, and her defloure; Unwholsome Vapours gathering black and thick Drop morn and even into a venomous show'r; Which by the womb of that adulterous Earth Drunk up, brings bastard Weeds and Poisons forth. 268 Amidst these dismal shades, is sunk a Grot Through whose black door pass endless Cries and Groans; In mourning curtains all the Windows shut Their joyless eyes; the Walls lament; the Stones Hang thick with tears, and their compassion to Their Habitation's doleful Genius show. 269 The Mistress of the house her weary bed Perpetually loads; which hedg'd about With melancholick screens, aforehand led Her thoughts in to her grave, and nearer brought Her Coffin's blackness to her mind, though it Already by her couche's side was set. 270 Her Pillows were of softest Down, but yet On churlish thorns and stones she seem'd to lie: Oft did she toss, and turn, and tumble, but Could never shift her sturdy Grief; which by That Motion only wakened was the more, And made her Weakness stronger than before. 271 Wild Hemicranies ragéd in her head; A desperate Quinsey choked up her throat; The tawny Jaundise in her eyes was spread; Strange arrows through her jaws the Toothach shot; Stark raving Madness sate upon her tongue; Ten thousand Cramps her shrivell'd body wrung. 272 The Fever, Pleurisy, Collick, Strangury Gout, Apoplexy, Scurvy, Pestilence, Stone, Rupture, Phthisick, Dropsy, Tympany, Flux, Surfeit, Asthma, and the confluence Of all divided Deaths, united were In one sad Mass, and learn'd to live in her. 273 The odious Scab, the everknawing Itch, The stinging Bile, the wasting Leprosy, The baneful Pocks, the Wolf and Canker (which Fatnéd on her their dreadful Luxury) Conspir'd with every sort of boiling Sore To cloth her round with most infectious Gore. 274 Pots, Papers, Glasses, sweet and stinking Things, Were marshall'd on a Cupboard standing by; Which Artists brought to mitigate her pangs, Or work some cure on their own Poverty. Costly Additions unto pain were these, And only eas'd her Purse's Pleurisies. 275 For though full many a dear Doctor there Talk'd words as strange as her Diseases, yet Her pertinacious Torments would not hear Either their Drugs of Nature or of Wit, Or mind their stories, or regard at all Their Oracles out of the Urinal. 276 Her whining Kindred round besieg'd her bed, And though alas her case were too too plain, With tedious love still ask'd her How she did, Heaping that Crambe on her other pain: Their fond Remembrances would never let Her any one of all her Woes forget. 277 Down to this loathsome She, stern Justice came; Tall was her Person and her Looks as high; Strength in her martial sinews made its home; Darts of keen fire stream'd out from either eye; For Men at length that She has eyes will find: Alas Earth's Justice and not Heavn's is blind. 278 Her right hand rul'd a sword of two-edg'd flame, Her left a Ballance; in one scale was thrown A mighty Mass inscrib'd with Herod's Name, A Mass of Pride and Blood, which press'd it down To gaping Hell; the other hover'd high Bubbling with light and vain Vacuity. 279 When Sickness spy'd (so naméd was the Elf) Her sovereign Queen, she rais'd her heavy head, And to obeysance forc'd her crazy self: Forthwith black streams of vexéd Poison fled Out from her sores, and with outrageous stink Ran down into her bed's contagious sink. 280 But as her boiling lips she op'd (from whence A cloud of steaming Plagues broke with her breath,) To ask what cause brought her immortal Prince Down to this baneful Porch of cruel death: Talk not said Justice, but get up and dress; My bus'ness now for speedyest speed doth press. 281 Though weak thou art, yet thou canst potent prove Whene'r on Mischief's errand thou art sent: Time was when thou a tedious way didst rove Invidious Hell and Satan to content; Though bold Usurpers they: and sure 't will thee Befit to do as much for Heav'n and Me. 282 Into the land of Uzz They made thee trudge, And poure the bottom of thy worst despight Upon the best of Men, if Heav'n can judge Of pure celestial Sanctity aright. More beautiful was Job in Heav'n's esteem Than thou to Earth didst make him horrid seem. 283 He heap'd this Scale as full of Virtue, as Fell Herod has replenish'd it with Vice: That other, which mounts up so lightly, was His score of Slips, his empty Vanities, Thin as the Air; which though sometimes it be Dusky with clouds, regains its purity. 284 See, see thou recompence that Injury By righteous Vengeance upon Herod; here My leave unbridles thy Extremity To run in full and uncontroll'd carreer. Run then, and make the Tyrant feel that now The Mistress of his health and life art Thou. 285 So spake the Queen of everlasting Dread, And in her black Cloud mounted home again. When Sickness leaping from her nasty bed, And in fierce haste forgetting her own pain, Furnish'd her self with every choisest sting To execute the now condemnéd King. 286 Then to her gloomy Chariot she went, A Chariot framéd of a pois'nous Steam: Her Speed was headlong, so was her Intent, And soon to Herod's royal Den she came: By no slowpacéd Coursers thether drawn, But by a pestilential Tempest blown. 287 Unseen she came, and with such cunning guided Her stealing Chariot's silent wheels, that she Quite down the Tyrant's throat as slyly glided As do's his unsuspected Breath, which he Lets in to fan his heart: and thus, alas, He swallow'd what his own Devourer was. 288 For now the Fury's work it was to fry His black soul in the furnace of his breast; Forthwith his entrails sing'd and scalded by An hidden fire, frighted away his Rest: He'd fain have risen, but he felt his Pains Had mix'd with their light firebrand's heavy Chains. 289 His strength deceives him, and his bed remains His only Throne, where he the worthy King Of mighty Torments miserably reigns; For flaming Pangs his ulcer'd bowels wring, And Water swelling underneath his skin Adds scoffing torture to the fire within. 290 His shameful Parts become more odious by Right down Corruption, which proves fertile there With monstrous Vermin; whose impatient fry In righteous rage their Prey aforehand tear; The leisure of his grave they scorn to stay, But undermine his heart, and eat their way. 291 And yet a deadlyer Worm than those was got Thither before, his Conscience deeply knawing; To stifle which he long had struggled, but The trusty Torment more resolvéd growing Woun'd round about his guilty soul so close That no Invention's power could get it loose. 292 His Sinews shrunk and all his Joints forgot The ready service of their wonted motions. The Air, which he had long defil'd, would not Wait on his Lungs; but frequent Suffocations Forc'd him to pay those Deaths for which his great Riot in Blood had ran him deep in debt. 293 His Friends he often call'd; but neither they Nor his Physitians durst come near his bed: For his hell-breathing stink damm'd up the way To Physick and to friendship. Never did Damn'd Dives more for Pitie's influence cry, Nor find less drop down on his Misery. 294 The dismal Scene of Bethlehem-slaughter now Displayéd was before his burning soul; The Mother's Fright with greater Dread he saw, And felt the Blood of all the Infants rowl Into his bosom in a violent stream; Yet not to quench, but higher raise the flame. 295 An hundred Furies at hot contestation He spies, which first should seize his bloody heart; And Hell's wide mouth, and mighty Preparation To entertain him with most sumptuous Smart; He hears all Ages poure whole seas of shame And cursing detestations on his Name. 296 And what shall now tormented Herod do? To Heav'n he will not, and he cannot sue, Since he had giv'n such proud Defiance to That God, whose Son in his desires he slew: And since the World below abhors him too, He 'gins to hate himself, and love his Woe. 297 Ingulféd deep in this dire Agony, He wildly gives the reins to Desperation: And now resolv'd in spight of life to die, Contrives how he may his own murder fashion, And once at least be righteously cruel, Making himself his Tyrannie's last fuel. 298 He thought of Poison; but could move no friend To lend him that destroying Courtesy. Besides; he fear'd no Venome durst contend With his all-bane-transcending Malady. At length, by woful fortune, he espy'd His faulchion hanging by his couche's side. 299 Which as he snatch'd, a venturous Page ran in And stopp'd the stroak; but could not stop his throat, Which strait he opened to a broader Sin, And in the face of Heav'n spew'd out his hot Impatient blasphemies: with which, he threw His curses upon all the World he knew. 300 Mean while to prison, where his Son in chains The Tyrant kept, his Death's false news was spread; Which whilst Antipater gladly entertains, His smiles became the forfeit of his head. 'Twas basely told to Herod; who in mad Spight shows that Worms his bowels eaten had. 301 Yet shall that Villain know that I, said He, Have life and rage enough him to destroy: Now by these dying spirits, which pant in me, I swear his life shall answer for his joy. Fetch me his head, that with these Vermin here Their Fellow-Traytor I all torn may tear, 302 Their Fellow-Traytor, and their Fellow-Son, For from my body sprung both He and They; Nor breeds their knawing more vexation To generous Herod, than his Smiles: away, Fetch me his head, that having bless'd mine eye With that Revenge, I may the chearlyer die. 303 Yet not content with this sole Sacrifice To his vast fury; he a way contrives How all his Nobles to his Obsequies By sudden massacre might pay their lives: That so his Hearse might follow'd be with tears If not for his own sake, at least for theirs. 304 But Heav'n prevented this fell Plot; and He Now having five days liv'd, and felt his death, In stead of Prayers, his wonted Blasphemy Repeated, and blew out his final breath. So agéd Dragons, when their Spirits flit, Breathe their last poison, and their Life with it. 305 When at his Coming, lo, th'infernal Pit Was mov'd; where every damnéd Prince arose From his sulphureous throne of pangs, and met This more deserving Tyrant, unto whose Incomparable Salvageness they knew Damnation's Prerogative was due. 306 Hell had his Soul no sooner swallowéd, But pious Joseph's Guardian hither came; To whom, reposéd on his sober bed, The mighty News he painted in a Dream; Bidding him now return to Jewry, where The storm was over, and the coast grown clear. 307 The Angel thus at once both justify'd His own word, and the Prophet's Vision; For great Hosea had of old descry'd That out of Egypt God would call his Son. Joseph awakes, and strait to Mary shews The long-expected, and now welcome News. 308 Then packing up his thrifty household-Stuff, And tenderly Providing for his dear And double Charge; he shakes Doubt's counsells off, And scorning all objections of fear, In humble Faith's assuréd valor sets Onward his way before the Day permits. 309 For now the Morn lay long before she rose, And dull Aquarius made it late e'r he Would wake the Sun: thus did thy hardy Spouse Take his long journy when the Day we see Is short and sad; to teach Thee what to do At any time when Heav'n shall bid thee go. 310 This Winter was the ninth which seal'd the Earth With Ice, and coveréd his seal with Snow, Since by his own, to wonders He gave Birth Who in a soil no less congealéd grew: Bate but the cold and churlish qualities, And what's a Virgin's Womb, but Snow and Ice? 311 This age had ripened Him with strength to bear A speedy journy, and did much allay The former scruples of his Parents' Care, Who now with greater haste devour'd their way, Then when they into Egypt pick'd their path; And thus in peace they reach'd their Nazareth. 312 Their Nazareth; for sacred Prophesies By adamantine chains are surely ty'd To their Effects: the fire shall sooner frieze, The truth of Gold in banks of Snow be try'd, The Sun because of Night, of Drought the Rain, Than falsehood any Prophet's tongue can stain. 313 Those Heav'n-Blown Trumpets, (though mysteriously That Blast resounded) long ago foretold His humble Title Nazareen should be: A Name of holy Dignity of old, And sitting fair on pious heads until It was outshinéd by the Christian stile. 314 And Psyche, what should we do longer here? Love bids thee follow their dear steps, to see Some further Marvels of thy Spouse, and where He prosecuted Love's sweet Mystery. This said; he gave his Steeds the reins; and they Together with the wind snuff'd up their way. CANTO IX. The Temptation. The ARGUMENT. LOVE by the Desert's love-abhorring Beasts Meekly acknowledg'd and adoréd is. Bold Famin forty days upon Him Feasts; To whose sharp teeth sly Satan joyneth his Soft Tongue's deceit; yet nothing by their great Attempts effected, but their own Defeat. 1 What reach of Reason e'r could fathom why Slight Dust and Ashes; vile Corruption's Son, The Heir apparent to the Misery Which lives in Death, and blends Destruction With all its Life; the poor Worm's uterine Brother; His Grave's first Cosen; his own Ruin's Mother; 2 The odious Riddle of unhappy Shame Whom foulest Beasts abhor; that Rebel who In monstrous madness fear'd not to proclaim A War with his own Bliss, but strove to wooe Immortal Vengeance; and himself to fell Whither Damnation would or no, to Hell: 3 Should so inamour Heav'n, as to obtain The dignity of highest Favorite; And in his Maker's grace so freely reign As by those Spirits to be serv'd, whose bright Extraction no acquaintance knows with Earth, Nor did Pollution e'r defloure their birth; 4 Had not Almighty Love vouchsaf'd to take This Lump of Clay and mould himself in it; Which precious Union hath power to make The total Mass of worthless vileness fit To dwell in Honor's throne, and there receive The Service Angels blush not now to give. 5 Hence comes high Heav'n content to stoop, and spare Part of its Quire to wait on Us below; Knowing its Master's Brethren sojourn here, Who by their very Dust that Kindred show: This is our Badge of shame advanc'd to be The stamp of our sublime Nobility. 6 In love to their incarnate Sovereign, who Upon the loftiest crest of all Creation Hath fix'd for ever our poor Nature, so That under her high feet full Adoration Has room to kneel, their ready service they Ev'n to the meanest of his Kinsfolks pay. 7 Whilst pompous Princes build their royal Pride On th'arm'd Protection of their numerous Guard; Their simplest vilest Slaves are dignifi'd With Heav'n's illustrious Host, to watch and ward Their several Charges; who though scornéd Things Below, are yet above design'd for Kings. 8 With Arms displayéd, and with open breast They stand to catch us when we falling are Into this hard and dangerous life; and least That fall should hurt us, they with tender care Their Wings' soft feathers spread, that in those beds Of Sweetness we may rest our infant heads. 9 Those heads from which no breeding hairs can peep, But in their catalogue they note them, and A strict account of their just number keep, By Heav'n committed to their trusty hand. And O, about our hearts how busy are Their Pains, who thus attend our idle hair! 10 Alas our other Nurses' cares were vain, So were our yearning Mothers' arms; did these Dear Fosterers not help them to maintain Their proper parts: and though their Fervor cease, These still persue Love's Task; hard Mothers may Forget their Babes, but that will never They. 11 O no: These faithful Guardians are Things Of try'd and never-failing Tenderness; Such as their everlasting snowy wings, Such as the living smiles and Joys which dress The court of heav'n, such as the dainty Air Which makes sweet Paradise both soft and fair. 12 Yet when just cause awakes their noble Might, No Scythian Rock stands half so stiff as they; No Lybian Lyon marcheth to the fight With higher courage, nor afflicts his Prey With deeper fright: for in their battel's rear Brave Triumph's self triumpheth to appear. 13 Nor needless is this Aid: for feeble We Have foes whose metal is all Spirit, and The Powers of Darkness, and Artillery Of Hell in pitchéd field against Us stand; Whom Belzebub their General, with Spight And ever-flaming Rage fires to the fight. 14 How shall poor Lambs outface the Tigre's Wrath; Or Partridges abide the Griffen's Might; How shall a Cockboat guide its even path When rising Tempests make Seas stand upright; How, how shall Dust block up the Serpent's road When ravenous He hasts to his sentenc'd food? 15 But with his Blackness these bright Champions fought Of old, and so complete a conquest got, That ever since that heav'n-renownéd Rout Wild Lucifer, in sad remembrance put Of his vain Spight, is in their presence tame, And like the burnt Child trembles at their Flame. 16 He trembles; if the Boldness of our Sin Wakes not fresh courage in his failing heart; For then on Us He by our selves doth win; Nor can our Guardians exercize their Art With due success, when by self-treason We Our forces join with Hell's Conspiracy. 17 When to mad Fancy sleep yields Reason's rein, Against polluted Dreams These stop the way, That no highfed and tickling Thoughts may stain The clouded Soul: for who, alas, can say, I always am my self, and though asleep The constant watch of Chastity can keep! 18 These rescue lend us when sly Danger near Our strait-besiegéd Soul or Body draws; These intercept bold Chance; these by the clear Lustre which flows about their blesséd brows Light us the way to Peace, and by their own Kind wings relieve our feet when weary grown. 19 These, active in the bosom's secret forge, Blow up Devotion's holy fire, to mint Refin'd pellucid Thoughts, and purely purge That Rust and Dross which might pollute the Print Of Jesu's Image, that bright Image which Will none but finest richest Ore inrich. 20 These teach th'embravéd Soul to tower above Those gross, yet empty things which flag below: These steer us through the Miracles of Love, And teach us in heav'n's Ocean how to row. These all are Brethren unto Phylax, who What He for Psyche did, for us will do. 21 Their aim his Steeds had now recoveréd And Palestine regain'd: when He aside Slopéd his bridle, and his journy sped Into another Desert, wild and wide By whose dire Drought affrighted Jordan, though Well stor'd with streams made haste away to flow. 22 As Psyche muséd at the rueful Place, Amongst whose desolate Nothings soon she lost Her questioning eye; with his divine embrace Phylax encourag'd her: and, though thou dost Not yet behold, said he, the Price of thy Long voyage, thou shalt find it by and by. 23 Here stopping his fleet Coach, He thus drove on His sweet Discourse: O my thrice dearest Dear (Because His precious Darling on whose throne My Adoration waits,) this Desert here Is but another Scene wherein thy Lord More fuel for thy wonder did afford. 24 It was repriev'd from bearing other fruit, That it in Miracles might fertile be; In Miracles whose far-resounding bruit Shall match the race of Time as long as He Has legs to run; and when He drops into His grave, in triumph o'r his tomb shall go. 25 When thirty times thy Spouse has seen the Sun Change all his Inns, whose golden Signs are hung Upon the Zodiack's girdle; reverend John Gave Penance's Alarm so shrill and strong As rous'd the dullest Souls, and mustered store Of wondering People upon Jordan's shore. 26 But they their reverential wonder on The glorious Baptist fix'd; not knowing they Had muffled in their own throng's clou'd a Sun Fairer than that which gilds the World with day; A Sun before whose Rise illustrious John Did only like the trembling twilight run. 27 For, first hid in his own Humility, Jesus himself had mixéd with the Crow'd; In which blind Tumult's open Torrent He Unto that River undiscover'd flow'd: So purest Airs in a confuséd Cry Though most melodious, breathe no Melody. 28 How He baptizéd Baptism; how a Crown Of heav'n's best beams perch'd on his fairer Head; How his coequal Spirit flutter'd down, And what Applause his Father thunderéd; I would repeat, but that it hugs thy heart, For with this Story now thou Girded art. 29 But by that nimble Dove's eternal Wings Being hither wafted from that River's shore, He Purity unto the dry Land brings As to the Water he had done before. Yet nothing else he brought; nor drink nor meat; He hither came to fight, and not to eat. 30 He came to fight; and bravely to revenge The World's old Quarrel, which subduéd lay E'r since through Man's unwarey heart the strange Bullet burst ope its death-deriving way; Which, as it smiling hung upon the Tree, Fond He an harmless Apple took to be. 31 He came to fight: and sturdy foes he found Arm'd round with Power but much more with Rage: Less than the Greatest had He been, this Ground Had prov'd his Tragedie's unhappy Stage: But so He fought, that here He forc'd at last A Feast of Triumphs to attend his Fast. 32 For any Combat never chosen were More dreadful Lists: observe that parchéd Hill, That Throne of Barrenness and Squallor, where Against the hungry North thou see'st a Cell; Which long hath gapéd but could never find Any Relief but sapless bitter wind. 33 That Den's the Dwelling of that Champion who First ventur'd on a Conflict face to face With God incarnate; one as like to do The feat of Spight, as any of the race Of Hell-begotten Fiends; yet prov'd as feeble As all the fearful world esteem'd her able. 34 Our noise had rous'd her now: see Psyche, see Her goodly Ushers; those seav'n-hornéd Things Though like to nothing but themselves they be; Must go for Kine: spermatick Nile; which brings Choise Monsters forth, in their strange birth alone Hath all his other Prodigies out-gone. 35 These lowing to the King in silent night, (Whom clear-ey'd Dreams through Fate's dark closets led,) He starts and wakes; but of the frightful sight He knew not how the Characters to read; Nor why those sharpset Portents leaner shewed When seav'n fat Kine their stomachs had subdued: 36 Till Joseph clear'd the Mist, and taught him what By those new Hieroglyphicks' Destiny Deign'd to unfold. But when the Beasts had got Their full and starv'd septennial Victory; They to this Cave for entertainment came, Resolv'd to serve a correspondent Dame. 37 Behold their Hair is shrivell'd up and dry; Their ugly Hides aforehand tann'd and tough; Their sharp-affrighted Bones stand staring high; Their wretched flesh's Reliques sink as low; Their Bellies to their Backs close tyéd are; And sear and knotted sticks for Legs they wear. 38 All Shape is shrunk to such Deformity That did their Horns not point them out, nor Thou Nor Pharaoh could have dreaméd they should be Descended from a Bull and honest Cow. And yet wellfavor'd Beasts are these to Her Their dismal Sovereign, who comes raging there. 39 Just at the word the Hag appear'd, with Look More keen than January's breath; or than Revenge's visage; or the piercing stroke Of barbarous North-begotten Boreas, when He his most massy chains of Ice hath hurl'd O'r Sea and Land, and stupify'd the World. 40 The sudden Dint shot into Psyche's heart Such terrible Amazement, that it slew Her heat and courage: but a counter Dart Of ready succour Phylax thither threw, And suppling her cold breast with soft and warm Comforts, proceeded thus her Soul to arm. 41 Thy Weakness much applauds thy Spouse's might Who stoutly grapled with this dreadful foe; The only glimpse of whose portentuous sight Could all thy trembling Spirits overthrow. But yet thy fear this Terror strengthned, and Assaulted thee by none but thine own hand. 42 If well thou mark'st what clogs the furies' train, Fair may'st thou read thine own security; For heavy at her heels she drags a chain Of Adamant, whose other end is by Heav'n's arm, in which all powers in triumph ride, Fast to thy mighty Savior's footstool ty'd. 43 Fiercely indeed at first she darted out; But now her curbéd pace is tame and slow: She knows her Compass, having often fought In vain against her chain's eternal Law. True to its duty is her trusty Tether, Nor can her strength persuade it to reach hither. 44 Thus when the greedy Mastiff leapeth from His nasty kennel, spurr'd by hungry wrath; The sullen Chain, which will not go from home, Checks his adventure and cuts of his path; At which the wretchéd Cur lets fall his ears, And tail, and spirit, and whines, and grins and lears. 45 For upon every wild and restless fiend Sure sits this Curse, that they cannot forbear To whet their Hunger and their Thirst to grind, And in keen fury for the fight prepare So soon as they have any prey descry'd; Although, mad fools, they know their feet are ty'd. 46 Mark how her Eyes are fled into her head, Afraid upon her curséd self to look; For in that leaf alas what could she read But what the Transcript is of Terror's book? Her skin's the paper (O how ghastly white!) Where Pain and Horror their black Legends write. 47 All upright staring stand her startled Hairs Of one another's touch in jealous dread; Two close shrunk Knots of Gristles are her Ears, Severely tying up her starvéd head: Her keeness is epitomizéd in Her pinchéd Nose, and her sharp-pointed Chin. 48 Like chalky Pits her hollow cheeks appear; Her sapless lips are parch'd and shrivell'd up; Her ivory Teeth's too-cleanly ranges glare With cruel whiteness, and stand always ope That her dire Tongue may ever dangle out To catch the rain and quench its burning drought. 49 Her trembling clung-up Neck has much ado Under her head's light burden not to crack: By its slight nodding flow'r oppresséd, so Shivers the famishéd and withered Stalk. For Arms, she shows two yards of skin and bone O'rpowr'd and tir'd with their own weight alone. 50 Her fleshless Hands are more than Vulture's Claws Tallon'd with never-prunéd Nails; and they, The barbarous Sergeants of her greedy jaws By their first touch for ever damn their prey. Her legs are two faint crinckling Props; her feet Already mouldring, haste their grave to meet. 51 The fatal Bunch of Corn which fills her hand, (O no! which makes Vacuity be there:) Are those Seav'n Ears which once on Nilus' strand To mock those hungry Oxen rangéd were; And now becomes her Rod, on which there grows No Grain, nor any other fruit, but Blows. 52 Was ever such Contraction seen, as there, About a waste, whose girdle Thinness is! The strait-lac'd Insect's slender Brood could ne'r Shrink up themselves into a scanter dress. Her Belly's sunk and gone; and spare she may Her storehouse, who no store has there to lay. 53 See'st thou her ruful Thighs and shouldiers knawn! Imagin not that any Beast but she Her self was guilty of the fact: her own Keen Tusks have grav'd those lines of Cruelty; For since she wanted other Cates to eat, She desperately made her self her Meat. 54 Little it was she from her self could tear; And yet where nothing else was to be had, That little seeméd full and dainty Cheer. But there alas, before she long had fed, Her banquet fail'd between her teeth, and she Instead of flesh, chew'd meer Vacuity. 55 This in her bosom ras'd that tempest's waves, Which, could thou hear it, would amaze thine ear: Her stomach gripes, and pricks, and roars, and raves, And all its misery objects to Her: So do her Bowels, bound in their own chains, And ty'd, and twisted up in knots of Pains. 56 Three fiends of choisest Power and Spight there are Whom daréd Vengeance sends to lash the Earth; The hidden Pestilence, wide open War; And famin this fell Hag, whose Drought and Dearth Burn with more Poison than the Plague, and kill With sharper wounds than War's relentless steel. 57 This is that Engine which breaks ope its way Through flesh and bone, and riots in the heart; Yet leaves all whole, that so her fury may Mock whom it tortures, and by cruel art Seem to forbear all Violence, whilst she Wakes Ruin by her silent Battery. 58 That living Death by which unhappy Man Is forc'd himself his funeral to begin; Whilst past hope's sphere he wanders faint and wan Wrapp'd in the winding sheet of his pale skin, And seeks his grave through whose cool door he may Into a milder Death himself convey. 59 That peerless Tyrant, whose impatience hath No possibility her Prize to spare; The dire Dispenser of the Dregs of Wrath; Of Torments Queen; the Empress of Despair; That ænigmatick foe, whose Ammunition Is nothing else but want of all Provision. 60 Expect not to behold her family, Or what Retinue on her court attends: No Servant ever strong enough could be To bear her presence, much less her Commands; Being assur'd they never should her will Unless her Belly too they could fulfill. 61 Indeed dry Languishment, pale Ghastlyness, Cold Desolation, her Handmaids be: But of an essence so jejune are these, That in her company deserted She Nothing but nothing meets, or, what is worse, The wretched fulness of an empty Curse. 62 But yonder Table which is hung so high Above her Cavern's door will tell thee what Were her exploits. When Mercy passéd by, This monitory sign she fixéd, that Mortals might learn what fiend was kennell'd here, And of this Den of greedy Death beware. 63 Lo what a smoaking Hurlyburly's there Of gallant Ruins tumbling on the ground. These once high-built and goodly Cities were, Which when War's mighty Ram could not confound, This Hag with no Pikaxes but her own Fierce Teeth, min'd all the walls and tore them down. 64 See there she chaseth frogs, and rats and mice, And hunts the dogs themselves; ambitious by These strangely-precious Dainties to suffice The loud Demands of her stern Boulimy. Discretely there the prudent Painter has The Earth of Iron made, and Heav'n of Brass. 65 But there her Girdle and her shoes she eats For that acquaintance which they had of old With Beef and Mutton and such classick Meats: There out she turns the silly useless Gold, And clapping on its poverty a curse, A savory Meal she maketh of her Purse. 66 She rouses there the sleeping mire, and by A strict examination makes it tell What hidden treasures in its bosom lie; Nor is she daunted by the unlikely shell, But ransacks still, and finds the gem within; For she the Oyster first fish'd out for Men. 67 The Dunghil there she rakes, and pries for fresh Strong-scented Excrements; right glad when she By lucky search achieves so rare a Dish Which needs, being reeking hot, no cookery. That Glass in which she drinks, and drinks up all, No other is but her own Urinal. 68 Her Jaws against that Fort of stone she try'd, When once she was immur'd in streights: and see How she compell'd and tore Success; those wide And ragged holes, her Tusks stout breaches be: Her hasty boistrous Stomach would not stay, And wanting other food, she eat her way. 69 That heap of Bones is all her Rage has left Of her own Parents, whose dear flesh she made Her barbarous feast, and them of life bereft By whom she liv'd; such is the salvage trade Of desperate Vipers, who their fury fatten Ev'n on the Womb in which they were begotten. 70 And yet no Vipers venture to devour Their proper Brood; 'tis Nature's strictest Law, That with Traduction Love should join her power, And like the Rivers, down hill strongest flow: Only this Fiend all Vipers dares excuse, And in her Children's blood her teeth imbrues. 71 For those bemangled Limbs which scatter'd be About the Picture's verge, the ruins are Of seav'n unlovèd lovely Babes, which she Fear'd not with her remorseless claws to tear, And back into her bowels force; if yet She any bowels had, who thus could eat. 72 This Comprehension of all Portents, this Most despicable, starv'd, but potent Hag, Was that bold Combatant whom Desperateness Clapp'd on the back, embraving to a brag And jolly confidence that mortal Might Could never with her Teeth maintain a fight. 73 Resolvéd thus, she rushéd from her grot To seize thy Spouse: but started when she saw Her strange Antagonist, and ventur'd not To try on mighty Him her awéd Claw: Yet mad with hunger, she contrives to make Her Craft the office of her fury take. 74 For though her Looks deep-dy'd in Horror's grain Such strong Affrightment round about had shed, That not the boldest Beast of all the Plain But from those direful Emanations fled, Leaving the Desert more than doubled, where Was nothing now but earth and stones, and air: 75 Yet here discovering one who seem'd prepar'd To meet and scorn the worst of Dangers, she Grew jealous of the Champion, and fear'd Some wiley stratagem might plotted be Against her rightdown force; which made her choose By Countremines his Project to oppose. 76 For waiting warey opportunity, And being thin and subtile, with the wind She mix'd her self, and then resolv'd to try How she might steal upon him by a blind And unperceivéd Charge. So Cowards fight By base Advantage, not by generous Might. 77 But He, who all her cruel counsel saw, From her abstruse carreer disdain'd to start; And wellcom'd with stout constancy the Blow Fiercely directed full against his heart; Giving her leave her spightful self to shoot Into his stomach through his yielding throat. 78 So when the Waves march in a raging tide Against his Cavern's mouth, the fearless Rock Makes good his ground, and never shrinks aside To shun the peril of the violent shock; But lets the Storm come in, and roar its fill In all the bowels of his resolute Cell. 79 Thus entred, up and down she rends her way, And seizeth with immediate greediness All those Reserves of Nutriment which lay Stor'd up in every close and dark Recess; And these she conquer'd without any stop, For as she met them strait she eat them up. 80 No Drop she left nor Crumb, to make reply To that most earnest Call of thousand Veins, Whose pritty craving mouths incessantly Su'd for their due relief: her dearest gains She counts by their Undoing, and makes all Their Cries, the Musick of her Festival. 81 The robbéd stomach thus too cleanly free Of all things but the Thief: she broacheth there The flood of all that corsive Cruelty With which her pinéd self she us'd to tear: A flood, to which most fretful Vinaigre Is gentle Oile, smart Gall is dropping Myrrh. 82 As when incenséd by the furious flame The Furnace 'gins to rage; if you deny The Cauldron some fresh Liquor's help to tame The insolent Heat's excess, and mollify Its rampant Thirst; how soon, alas, the poor Copper it self will boil, and burn, and roar! 83 So fares it with the Entrails, where the fire Which Nature kindled, if it wants its fuel, On what comes next to hand will wreak its ire, And grow against the Stomach's substance cruel: For all its Life consists in constant Meat; And when it dies, it do's but cease to Eat. 84 And yet with adamantine Bravery Thy Spouse in this Conspiracy of Pains His Patience arms; and though his bowels frie In mutinous flames, he valiantly refrains From all Complaints and sighs and signs that he Felt what he felt, stern Hunger's tyranny. 85 He by this Fast's sharp Med'cine pleaséd was To cure the Eating of the fatal Tree Where grew that Death which was entail'd to pass On Eve's and Adam's wretched Progeny: He freely what he might receive, refused, Because, what they forbidden were, they used. 86 (Thus must chaste Water curb the lusty flame; Thus Cold's strict bands must chain licentious Heat; Thus sober Weight must idle Lightness tame; Thus wholsom Sour must prune luxurious Sweet; Thus honest Day must chase out thievish Night; Thus Contraries with Contraries must fight.) 87 And by his venerable Practise he Has consecrated and advancéd this Despiséd thing, to that sublime degree Of glorious delight, that Fasting is The Dainties of the Saints, to which they can Invite their hearts, and feast the Inner Man. 88 For whilst they at this mistick banquet sit, The saucy Flesh learns to be meek and mild; The boiling Blood grows cool, and every fit Of wilful Lust forgetteth to be wild; The Passions to Reason crouching stand; The Brain grows clear, and all its clouds disband. 89 Their free unhamper'd Contemplations towre Up to the crest of their divine desires, And through those everlasting Wonders scoure, Which shine as far beyond the starry fires As they above this Mass of Earth are whirld, Which grovels in the bottom of the World. 90 Thus from that Slavery they redeeméd are Whose knots their teeth had tied; thus they throw Their clogs away, and on free pinions rear Themselves into themselves: being quickned now By brisk Devotion's Flame, and not by that Gross kitchen-Heat which warms their spit and pot. 91 Nor is the Body forc'd to bear the pain, Whilst all the pleasure to the Soul accrues, But in its kind reaps full as sweet again: For its intirest vigor this renews, And by fresh lively feathers quits the cost Of all those rotten moulting plumes it lost. 92 For when high-fed Distempers sneak away; And that dark Seed of crude Infirmities Which in the bodie's furrows nestling lay, Before its birth most seasonably dies; Fasting the physick gives: yet generous She (O cheap Physician!) never takes a fee. 93 She Nothing takes; and would have Man do so; For all her Recipes are only This: She turns the deep Complaint of bitterest wo Into an high-strain'd Dialect of Bliss, And for this reason dares the Sick assure Of Health's return, that Nothing them can cure. 94 O Sovereign Nothing! which so deeply could Thy Spouse inamour, that on it He fed Twice twenty days and nights: though Sleep so bold Might grow to venture on his Eyes, it did Not once presume to touch, much less to fight The noble Paradox of his Appetite. 95 That generous Appetite, which strictly kept This long long Watch without one wink of rest; Yet since it suted with his pleasure, reapt From this severest Restlessness, the best Of Ease's sweets: though fasting, He could fill Himself; for now his Stomach was his Will. 96 Unknown were those exuberant Dainties He Ev'n in the midst of Emptiness enjoy'd: 'Twas always Meat and Drink to him to be About his Father's glorious work employ'd. O precious Piety, which furnishest Without the Kitchen's help so rich a Feast! 97 The Fury spent her own his Strength to tire, But fretted, gnaw'd, and vex'd her self in vain. Hast thou not heard how Moses, all on fire With stout Devotion, did of old sustain As many days and nights on Sina's head, A stranger all the while to drink and bread? 98 If by approach to God faint Man could grow So much above the temper of a Creature; If by attendance on the Moral Law He could forget the urgent Law of Nature; What might He do, to whose great Moses's Face In all its splendors still, but dusky was! 99 What might He do who did not only draw So near to God, but who Himself was He; No Instrument, but Author of the Law, By Virtue of his proper Deity. No Proxy He, nor stated in his Might Barely by Patent, but by Native Right. 100 He who their pow'r to Salamanders gave Safely to scorn the siege of any flame, And in the furnace's red bosom live, Making the hostile fire become their tame And friendly food; might well Thirst's drought subdue, And turn its burning wrath to cooling Dew. 101 He, to whose Bounty's Hand Chamelions ow Their Virgin Privilege, by which they may Contemn all gross unweildy Meats, and grow Fat upon sapless Air; can find a way As pure a diet for himself to get, And force the Winds to blow him in his Meat. 102 Nay, since the soul of Bread is dull and dead, And no assistance can to Life afford, Unless it self be fortify'd and fed By God's all-forming all-supporting Word; He well can spare its aid, yet want no food, Who is himself th'Essential Word of God. 103 Witness his most authentick Might; for now An intimation of his Royal Will With terror struck the gnawing Fury thro', Commanding her not to disturb him, till He gave her leave; Who busy ment to be With other Beasts of better worth than she. 104 Soon saw the Hag how rashly she had thrown Her wariest strength into a conquering Net, Where her fell Teeth and Nails were not her own, But His whom she design'd to make her meat. Against her self she therefore madly bent Her spight, and both her hair and heart-strings rent. 105 But safe and unmolested He went on To seek those Beasts which from the dreadful Grot Of this intolerable Fiend had run To shroud their trembling Lives; and thought it not Beneath himself, since He the Saviour is Of Man and Beast, to care for what is His. 106 When Oxen he and Asses had descry'd Lowing and braying their desires of grass, He kindly thought of what did him betide, When in their house he entertainéd was; How Bethlehem stable with the hay and manger Welcom'd the New-born-men-rejected Stranger. 107 A herd of Goats then met his Eye; which in His gentle Bosom rais'd a pitying sigh, To think of those whom bold and odious sin Had made of stinking kin to these: yet by His gracious look his love to them he spake: He hates no Goats but those he did not make. 108 A flock of Sheep went bleating after them, Whose sucking Sons made him reflect again Upon himself God's everlasting Lamb, Born in proud Salem's shambles to be slain. He blest them all; and for their sustenance, Ingag'd his Magazine of Providence. 109 Then friendly to a Pool with them he came, The only Water which that Desert knows; (If yet that Pool defile not Water's name, Which only with deep muddy poyson flows.) The banks were throng'd with savage Beasts, which lay Panting and gasping, and forgot their prey. 110 For parching thirst had now drunk up their ire; And hungry hunting would but more increase That too-prevailing fury of their fire, Which only Water's mildness might appease; Yet though their Tongues lay frying on the brink, They durst not quench them in that dangerous Drink. 111 For yet the long-expected Unicorn Delay'd his coming; He who always by The piercing Antidote of his fair Horn First broach'd the wholesom Liquor which did lie Imprison'd in the poyson's power, and then A health to all his fellow-beasts begin. 112 Nor was his tardiness that day by chance, The only day in which he could be spared; For now Salvation's Horn, who could dispense That sovereign vertue which was deeplyer feared By every Poison, than what breaketh from The potent Unicorn's, was thither come. 113 Great was the Congregation; for there The princely Lyon lay, the angry Dog, The mountainous Elephant, the shaggy Bear, The hasty Wolf, the foaming Boar, the Hog His grumbling Wife, the roaring frowning Bull, The Porcupine of ammunition full. 114 The spotted Panther, stiff Rhinocerot, Swift-footed Tigre; and a thousand more: Whom wilder thirst had thither forc'd, in hot And panting throngs beleagueréd the shore, Crowding as stoutly Water now to get As Noah's frighted Troops to 'scape from it. 115 But when thine unexpected Spouse appeared, With reverent amazement every Beast The sacred spectacle both lov'd and feared, And by ingenuous bashfulness confest Whom they beheld, and how unworthy they Esteem'd themselves to drink his Aspect's ray. 116 Yet that first Glance did such refreshment dart That all the forces of their Thirst it slew. So when unto a long-afflicted Heart Joys their unlook'd-for sudden count'nance shew, The blessed Glimpse frights gloomy Grief away, Buries black Night, and wakes up beauteous Day. 117 These Beasts were heirs to them who when as yet Time and the World were young, in Paradise At God's own summoning together met, To pay their homages in humble guise To princely Adam; who sate mounting high On his fair Throne of native Monarchy. 118 Well then they mark'd their Sovereign's Eyes and Face, And all his Person's lovely Majesty, Which streaméd on them with such potent Grace, That they durst not Allegiance deny To so sweet Violence, but to his beck And gentle Yoke bow'd down their loyal Neck. 119 But when unwary Adam's fall had spred Guilt's vail upon his brused Face; with wonder The Creatures gaz'd, and fain would there have read Their former Lesson of Majestick splendor: But seeing all was blurr'd, Abhorrence sworn And open Foes of Subjects made them turn. 120 Their Sons and Generations after them Succeeded in their hate to human Sin: And all these barbarous Beasts which hither came Had in that Quarrel born and nurtured been; Who whensoe'r Chance shewéd them a Man, To him as their condemnéd prey they ran. 121 For never spy'd they any one, but in His self-betraying countenance they saw The odious characters of deep-writ Sin; Which their commission was their powers to draw Against the foul Apostate, and withal Their fury answer Vengeance's loud Call. 122 But when on JESU's face they try'd their Eyes, No blur or sign of guilt they could descry: His looks were purer than the virgin skies, Polish'd with Beauty's best serenity, Array'd with princely Stateliness, and dight With Love, with Life, with Grace, and Royal light. 123 This wak'd those ancient seeds of Memory, Which prudent Nature in their hearts had set; And which by wise Instinct did signify That their unspotted Monarch they had met. They had indeed; for this was Adam too: Alas that Beasts much more than Men should know! 124 Men knew him not; but Beasts distinctly read In him the Protoplast's all-graceful feature: Such were the gallant Glories of his Head; Such was the goodly measure of his Stature; Such were the reverend Innocencie's beams Which from his flaming Eyes pour'd pleasure's streams. 125 Such radiant awfulness Men fancy in Th'apparent heirs of earthly Kingdoms, that They think the King of Beasts by royal Kin To their condition groweth courteous at Their sight, and quite forgets his cruel sense Of being Salvageness's dreadful Prince. 126 What wonder than if thus it happen'd now The mighty only Heir of Heav'n was here; He, for whose high and best-deserving Brow Eternity was busy'd to prepare That Sun-outshining Crown, which flaming is Upon his Incarnation's lowliness! 127 No longer durst the princely Lyon in His wonted State, but in submission, rise; His never-daunted Tail till now, between His Legs he humbled, and let fall his Eyes: Confessing to the Beasts that made his train, That he was not their only Sovereign. 128 Approaching thus, he couchéd on the ground, And with ingenuous devotion Kiss'd JESU's Feet; rejoycing he had found Juda's Majestick Lyon, who alone Wore in his noble Looks fair-writ the Name Of Emperor of this created Frame. 129 By his devout example all the rest Their now engagéd Duty learn'd, and did: In decent modest order every Beast His service by a meek kiss offeréd: And then they all before him prostrate lay, Humbly expecting what their Lord would say. 130 He in a Mystick Dialect, which soon They understood, his Royal pleasure spoke: For in that energetick Language on All their First-fathers' necks he laid his yoke; A yoke without regret drawn ever since By their most tractable Obedience. 131 Nay, not those Animals alone; but Trees, Shrubs, Plants, Pomona's Fruits, and Maia's Flowers, The Earth, the Air, the Fire, the boistrous Seas, The Winds, the Hails, the Frosts, the Snows, the Showers, The Dews, the Lightning and the Thunder, Hell And Heaven, and all things ken his Language well. 132 For being that Eternal Word, from whom What ever Is, receives it self; He knows In what intelligible way to come To all his Creatures, and pronounce his Laws. A Word of boundless bounds and potency To every thing significant may be. 133 To every thing; and more than so: for He On empty Nothing his Commands can lay; And long before, ev'n in their Seeds they be, Summon what Worlds he pleases; nor dare they Plead ignorance of what he says, but by Instant Existence to his Call reply. 134 (O how portentous is that Deafness then Which dammeth up the most rebellious ear Of those unhappy Heav'n-defying Men, Whom their own welfare cannot wooe to hear Almighty Mercie's sweetest-tunéd Charms, Nor Vengeance's long-thundering Alarms!) 135 What 'twas He spake, tho' they best understood, Yet if my guessing may presume of leave, He charg'd them to confine their thirst of Blood, And for his Incarnation's sake reprieve Those who were linkéd by that Mystery To Heav'n and him in near affinity. 136 For now he came to ope a gentler Age To all his World than heretofore had run, To banish Spight, and Salvageness, and Rage, And to establish endless Peace's Throne; He came degraded Man to re-ordain, And make him Prince of all below again. 137 To re-ordain him, that he would but yield Not to be vassal unto Sin and Hell; If he would be content his strength to build On's Maker's Power, if he whose treacherous Will Enslaves himself, would by Heaven's Pleasure rein His Passions' freedom which is Reason's chain. 138 And to encourage their Obedience, He Told all their Beasts, their expectation and Long-panting Groans should shortly answer'd be, For he himself would haste to break the Bond In which Corruption kept them slaves, and them With Heaven's dear Heirs to Liberty redeem. 139 This done; his sacred Hand he lifted up And round about on his devotos dealt His bounteous Blessing; strait they 'gan to hop Their thankful dance, when in their hearts they felt The joyful influence which, they knew not how, From his dry Hand's widestreaming fount did flow. 140 Then with the fairest manners plain Beasts had, Shaking their tails, and louting low their heads, They took their reverent leave; not only glad Their hardest breasts were sown with gentle seeds, But that they in their Sovereign's lovely dread A Lyon and a Lamb together read. 141 Thus left alone he hasts to make due use Of privacy's rich opportunity. What fitter place could wise Devotion chuse Where she with freedom through all heav'n might fly? What is the Desert, but an Harbour, which No storms of this tumultuous world can reach? 142 Besides; his active Soul now lightned by His fast, and fairly poiz'd on sprightful wings, Was well appointed up to tower, and try The altitude of Heav'n's sublimest things. Not that he needed this advantage, but To Man this useful Copy deign'd to set. 143 As when more fuel's heap'd upon the hearth Than well the Chimny's stomach can digest; The flames their wonted bounds despising, forth With fury rush, till all the Room opprest With bright and dark billows of fire and smoak In that dry Sea's unruly storm they choak. 144 So when intemperate Man ingorgeth more Than corresponds with his Capacity; With burning Vapors that superfluous store Riots about his heart and head. But he Who trades in fasting, keeps his Spirit's sphere Calm and unclouded: as did JESUS here. 145 Through that unfathomable Treasury Of sacred Thoughts and Counsels and Decrees, Built in the Palace of Eternity And safely lockéd with three massy keys Whereof himself by proper right keeps one, With intellectual lightness now he ran. 146 And there he to his humane Soul unvail'd The flaming Wonders of Divinity; A Sea through which no Seraph's eye e'r sail'd, So vast, so high, so deep those secrets be (God's nearest Friend, the Soul of JESUS is Whom he admits to all his Privacies.) 147 There, in an adamantine Table, by The glorious hand of Goodness fairly writ He saw his Incarnation's Mystery, The Reasons, Wonders, and the ways of it. There freely rang'd his Contemplation from His scornéd Cradle to his guarded Tomb. 148 His Soul rejoicéd all the way it ran, And taught his Fast to turn a sumptuous Feast: Each Grief, each Pain he took delight to scan, And what the bitterest was he rellish'd best. Not for a World would he have wanted one; But could have wish'd a crueler Passion. 149 Thus having exercis'd the day; when night On heav'n's wide face her sable mantle spread, He other Work began: no leaden weight Of Drowsiness lagg'd down his watchful head: So strong his Fast was grown, that no dull cloud Durst to his brain out of his stomach croud. 150 Those silent hours he spent in ardent Prayers, His evening and burnt sacrifice; and by The quick ascent of those mysterious stayers Climb'd back again to heav'n's sublimity; Where his Ejaculations busy grew, And thicker than th'Angelick Legions flew. 151 There pray'd he that the world might not disdain The gentle yoak he meant on it to lay; Nor force Heav'n to come down to Earth in vain, But to its now obtruding Bliss give way; That since God to Humanity did stoop, Man would into Divinity get up. 152 That generously-ingenuous Souls would dare To trace his hardy steps, though flesh and blood, With all the Pleas of Tenderness and Fear Full in the way of their adventure stood: That Piety might Rest in Watching find, And learn by Fasts to fatten up the Mind. 153 But now no less than forty times the Sun, The Giant of the day, had from the east Prick'd forth his Golden-trappéd Steeds, and run His never-wearied race into the west; And watchful Vesper dress'd as oft with light The silver tapers, and trim'd up the night. 154 When thy wise Spouse, who all the seasons knew Of Heav'n's abstrusest Dispensations, gave Th'unbridled Monster's Raving leave to shew Her teeth's full power. And how profound and brave This Counsel was, thou by and by shalt see; For he on yielding built his Victory. 155 As when the greedy Dog, who long had lain Muzzel'd and chain'd in presence of his meat, The freedom of his feet and chaps doth gain; For all the time he lost, he strives to eat, Flying like lightning on his breakfast, which His hasty paws and jaws together catch: 156 So Famin now releas'd to her own will, Reveng'd her long restraint with rampant spight; And had it but been possible to kill Life's unconsenting Lord, her furies' Might Had from the far less raging villanies Of People, Priests, and Pilat, snatch'd their prize. 157 For with such fell remorslessness she ne'r Had heartned up her Tallons and her Teeth, To wage her monstrous hunger's war, as here; Nor with more confidence e'r promis'd Death To save his Sithe the labour: and some ground The Hag in JESUS saw her hopes to found. 158 His tortur'd Stomach roar'd, his bowels clung, The heav'nly Graces of his count'nance fell; Thirst parch'd his beauteous lips and burnt his tongue; But by his own permission all: for well He knew that if he grew not faint and wan, Hell would suspect him to be more than Man. 159 Hell's jealous Prince had conn'd all Prophesies Which pointed out a greater King than He; A King decreed from Jesse's Root to rise, And quite extirpate his long Tyranny; Upon his guard he stood, and watch'd to see The dangerous time, and who the Man should be. 160 At first, thou know'st, that Quire which sung to Earth Good Will and Peace, through Him did Terror dart; The glorious rumor of the Infant's Birth No sooner stroke his ear, but broke his heart; He Simeon's Jubilation echoed by A Groan, and Anna's Preaching by a sigh. 161 With curs'd misgiving thoughts he chew'd upon The Benedictus of old Zachary; The East's sweet Star's irradiation Blinded with horror his amazéd eye; His guilty Soul was rack'd in sad suspense To hear the Magy's pious Confidence. 162 But when those fatal Items rous'd his pride To take some course this danger to repress, And he had Herod's desperate Sword employ'd; He hop'd, and bragg'd, he had not stroke amiss: Besides, now thirty years could not discover Any great fear, he dream'd the worst was over. 163 And much it chear'd him to remember that Messias was to be a Virgin's Son: Thy Lord, his insolence term'd Joseph's Brat, The silly Carpenter's poor Urcheon; Who liklier was some simple house to build Than raise a Kingdom and a scepter weild. 164 Yea to that fond excess of boldness he Hardned his thoughts, as to imagin that Great Daniel's most punctual Prophesy Had plainly miss'd its mark: nor car'd he what The other Prophets talk'd, now He who set Messias' time, so foully fail'd in it. 165 But when on Jordan's bank he heard and saw Heav'n's glorious Testimonials of its Son; His sturdy Impudence began to thaw, New Terror through his curséd bones did run. Long 'twas e'r he could recollect a thought His drift of Mischief how to bring about. 166 So when the flood-gates which have long stood ope, Their mouths with sudden resolution shut; The checkéd streams, which flow'd with more than hope Of being Masters of that Pass, are put Unto their deepest plunge, and swell and roar In doubt which way their fury they shall pour. 167 At last he hither tracéd him and set That fury Famin to begin the fight: Deep desperate anguish made him vex and fret, To see the vain contention of her spight For forty days together: but at length When she prevail'd, his pride renew'd its strength. 168 On Chance's vain account he scor'd it up That JESUS had sustain'd the fight till now: As he had done, when from their pillars' top To dust he saw his Egypt's Idols bow; Because since then he found some new ones able To stand, and Memphis once more Isi's stable. 169 And now his cue was come, to Hell he stepp'd And op'd a Box, which by his couch's side, He as the dearest of his Treasures kep'd: Ten thousand quaint Delusions there were ty'd In one another's gentle snarles so strait That Craft her self from hence might learn deceit. 170 There lay smooth-burnish'd words, and quick mutations, Sleight-handed Tricks, importunate Courtesies, Sweet looks, delicious shapes, and dainty fashions, False loves, invenom'd fawnings, holy lies; Those gorgeous frauds by which he luréd Eve For one poor Apple Heav'n and God to leave. 171 And those by which he holy Aaron made More silly than the Calf his fear erected; Those which unconquer'd Samson's strength betray'd; Those which the Fort of Chastity dejected In David's heart; and those whose witchery Charm'd his wise Son to fond Idolatry. 172 This also was the curséd nest of those More wily wiles he forgéd to entice The brave Inhabitants of Heav'n to close With his Conspiracy, when in the skies He drew his army up and ventur'd on Against the Thunder's mouth, and God's own Son. 173 All which he takes, and squeezes into one Conflux of more than quintessential Guiles: With which insidious Extraction His thirst he quenches, and his bosom fills; And so returns into this Desert, well Stuff'd with the best, because the worst, of Hell. 174 Imperial was his Retinue, for A thousand burly Peers of Phlegeton Had robb'd earth, air, and sea of all their store Of braveries, and proudly put them on: All which were answer'd by the rich attires Both of their haughty Horses and their Squires. 175 But as the Cedar on tall Liban's head Dishonors dwarfy shrubs that creep below; And as th'illustrious Peacok's glories spread Disgrace upon the sparrow, or the Crow; So now majestick Satan's Port transcended Whatever in his Lord's might be commended. 176 Twelve sable steeds, smug as the old Rav'n's wing, Of even stature, and of equal pride; Sons of the wind, or some more speedy thing, To his fair Chariot all abreast were ty'd; That in this royal Range each first might be, And jointly shew their several gallantry. 177 Perpetual sparks of Vigorousness they shot From their two fountains of prospective fire; Their mighty Neighings easy conquest got Of every noise, and made god Mars his quire; And thus through Clouds both black and big as they Thunder and Lightning use to rend their way. 178 As ebon-shining Bows, so bended were Their sinewy Necks; their stomachs boiled over In restless foaming scum, which far and near Flung their disdain; their Pawing did discover With what impatience on the earth they trode And coveted to trace th'ætherial rode. 179 Their shoes were Silver, and their bridles gold; Thick pearl their velvet trappings studded; their Luxuriant mains in curléd volumes roll'd Down to the ground, their starting Ears did wear Proserpine's favors with rich jewels tip'd; The way their full Tails for their Sovereign swep'd. 180 The Wheels were Cedar, clouted round about With Gold's more precious Rival, Chrysolite; The Charet Almug, sumptuously wrought With an embroider'd confluence of bright Well-order'd Gems: upon which princely Seat Prouder than it, sate Belzebub the Great. 181 So Titan mounted on his flying throne Of flaming glory, sweepeth through the skies, Outglittering all the combination Of his bright Coach's raies by his own eyes And by's imperial proper fire, exceeds The ardor of his Heav'n-devouring steeds. 182 What Pomp in Alexander's count'nance reign'd, Or swell'd upon Nebuchadnezzar's brow; Improv'd and to a loftier Tumor strain'd, To his own Aspect he transplanted now; Having compounded in one stately ly The universal looks of Majesty. 183 Disdain and Frowns the chief ingredients were, And long ago he learn'd to manage them: Yet Grace and royal Mildness too were there, If need should be some soft Deceit to frame. With awful gravity deep flow'd his beard; And he some wise and ancient Prince appear'd. 184 A tripple crown of diamond on his head, Wherein was graven Earth, and Air, and Sea, His Empires provinces decipheréd; So shameless his Presumption is, that he Counts Adam's Right his own, and writes his stile E'r since he snar'd him by the Apple's Guile. 185 Down from his shoulders streaméd to his feet A Mantle of estate, with Ermyns lin'd: Whose texture's glorious face so thick was set With oriental Gems, no eye could find What web it was, it being bravely lost In that magnificence of too much cost. 186 Three troops of Pages on his wheels did wait, The first in Azure, and in Green the next, The third in darkest Purple: which conceit Was but the Comment on his Crown's proud Text. Ten thousand Curassiers, his dreadful Guard, Before him trotted, and his passage clear'd. 187 Of Sumptures, Wains, and Carriages a Sea Mannerly roll'd its plainer flood behind: Which seem'd the Transmigration to be Of all the Earth, engagéd now to find Some other World whose larger bounds might give Leave to those straitned Swarms at large to live. 188 Yet dar'd no justling Tumults interpose Amongst their throngs, whom silent Discipline Led on in decent state, though all sworn foes To modest Order's Rules which fairly join Troublous Disparities in Union's rest: Confusion's Prince well knows this Peace is best. 189 In this magnitick Port, his Progress He Gravely pretended through his Earth to take: That beaten Circuit, where incessantly Some hellish bus'ness kept his Rage awake: But now more dangerous was this Lyon grown Than when he rangéd Roaring up and down. 190 For though that barbarous Roar loud Terror spoke, Withal it gave fair warning to beware; But when majestick Grace and Order cloak His thievish Enterprise, He charmeth fear Too fast asleep, to think a King in so Great pomp, a stealing would, and cheating go. 191 See'st thou that rueful place, that garden where Eternal Barrenness deep-rooted grows; Where unrelenting flints and pebles are Both soil and fruit? that Scene thy Saviour chose Wherein to wrestle with keen Famin, and Grant her free leave on her own ground to stand. 192 And hither march'd that Pompous Pagentry: Whose surly Van when they with JESUS met, Deign'd not poor looking Him the charity Of half an eye, but proudlier forward set: For those inferior vulgar Feinds had not Been privy to their Sovereign Cheater's Plot. 193 But Satan, though his spightful heart did leap For joy to see how in his fallen cheeks Hunger had writ her cruel conquest deep; With fainéd princely pitty yet off breaks His course: the Steeds, in foaming scorn to stay, Their bridles champ'd, and stamp'd upon their way. 194 But He more gentle seem'd than they were fierce; For, fixing on thy Lord his yearning eyes, His breast he smote in shew of deep remorse, His gracious head he sadly shakéd thrice, And then as oft to heav'n he lookéd up, And cunning tears at every look did drop. 195 He hop'd the pinéd Man would bend his knee (Too feeble long to stand,) and succour crave Whilst yet he could receive: he hop'd that He Would ope his mouth, since so did now his Grave: But Him too stout he found to buckle down; He nobly held his tongue, and held his own. 196 With that, the royal Tempter thus began: My Pity never was till now neglected By any He who wore the face of Man; Much less by such whom Famin had dejected Below the looks of human life. And yet Perhaps some Mystery I now have met. 197 That with contented patience thou canst be The miserable Prey of Famin, and Forbear (if not disdain) to ask of me Who with all courteous Succour ready stand, Implies thy strength, whate'r thy face appear, Higher to move than in an human sphere. 198 Where-e'r she had it, Rumor sent of late A strange Relation to my ear, which she Profest she took both from the leaves of Fate, And from experimental Certainty: 'Twas, that the Son of God had chang'd his Home, And privately on earth to sojourn come. 199 She added, That his garb was plain and mean, Since he was but a Pilgrim here below; And rather came to see than to be seen, As wisest Travellers are wont to do. But more she told me not; perhaps, that I And my good fortune might the rest descry. 200 I would be loth it should reported be In heav'n, to my Realm's everlasting shame, That this renown'd celestial Prince, when He To any of my territories came, Should taste no argument to make him know And say at home, The World is kind below. 201 For much my Honor it concerns, and me, That worthy Entertainment should attend Such mighty Strangers: and, if thou be He, Take notice thou hast met a royal friend; A friend both able and resolv'd to prove That thou all Glory hast not left above. 202 But yet these deep-plow'd wrinkles ill would suit My solemn forehead, and this reverend Snow My head and beard, if Rashness should confute Those sage and sober Tokens; if I now Who purchas'd long ago the high esteem Of Grave and Wise, should Light and Credulous seem. 203 Then since my princely Credit pleadeth for A clear Probation, you may not deny Some rational Assurance who you are; Nor can that Evidence be seal'd, but by Some potent Demonstration, that to you As to their Sovereign, Nature's Statutes bow. 204 If you be that great He, God's mighty Son, (And God forbid you such a Truth should hide,) Let it suffice your fast thus far has run, And now a breakfast for your self provide: Lo here a Board with Pebles ready spread, Speak but the word, and make them loaves of bread. 205 The Tempter so. JESUS wisely saw How he suspended was in jealous Doubts, And by this Artifice contrivéd how To extrecate his snarl'd perplexéd thoughts: His heav'nly Prudence therefore took a course On's hellish Craft a darker Mist to force. 206 For as a noble Champion when the Blow Flieth with deadly aim against his heart, With warey buckler back again doth throw The intercepted and deceivéd Dart: So did thy Spouse by God's unconquer'd Word, His ready shield against the Tempter's Sword. 207 'Tis written, that the life of Man, said He, Shall lean not only on the staff of Bread, But on a stronger steadier Prop, and be By God's more wholsom Word securely fed. What need we loaves our Hunger's rage to still? From God's Mouth floweth that which Man's will fill. 208 O most impenetrable Buckler! how Slender an Help is tripple steel to thee! Seav'n-times-redoubled Adamant must bow To thy less vulnerable Durity. O Scripture! what vain straws and feathers are Goliah's Arms, if they with thee compare! 209 This Psyche, this is that victorious Shield, Which sure Protection can on thee bestow, Though all Hell's Troops pitch'd in a martial field Conspiréd have, and sworn thy Overthrow. Its noble use thy Spouse declar'd to thee, Who fought with none but this Artillery. 210 With this he fought, who Thunder had at call And all Heav'n's Hosts attending his Command: No strength would he employ, but what might fall Within the reach of thy short feeble hand. Thou canst not thunder: yet his sacred Word Thou well mayest wield, and wound ev'n Satan's Sword. 211 But as the greedy Wolf, once beaten back; By that repulse is but enragéd to Rebound with doubled spight, and fiercelier make His fresh encounter: angry Satan so Brus'd by this fall, and vexéd at the pain, Plucks up his spirits and ventures on again. 212 Yet as he charg'd, he on the sudden felt His Confidence's foot begin to slip; Bold was his Will, but timorous his Guilt; And, though he thought not on't, he bit his lip. His Jealousy at last advis'd his Wrath Calmly to march, and in the safest path. 213 His Plot now therefore slylyer driving on, He plausibly pretends this sullen Place To be the Stage where Heav'n's illustrious Son Should act his Greatness, too unworthy was; And in high courtship hasts to change this mean And despicable, for a gallant Scene. 214 For as a stragling Cloud came by that way, He, as th'usurping Monarch of the air, His leisure sternly beckned it to stay, And so gat up into his flying chair; Taking thy Lord with him, who was content To try what by this new design he ment. 215 Nodding the next Wind then on him to wait, He through the welkin scour'd, and quickly came (For now his way all open lay and streight,) To this long journey's but, Jerusalem; Where on the Temple's highest Spire he set Him who, he fear'd, might prove the God of it. 216 Then to his work alone he fell; his Train Being left behind, and chargéd to attend Their King's return: for much he did disdain, In case he could not now atchieve his end, His envious Elves again should witness how A starvéd Man Hell's Sovereign overthrew. 217 He wisely ponder'd that the Arms whereby Thy Spouse had him repuls'd, the mightiest were; And therefore cunningly resolv'd to try If he could Scripture bow to serve his war. O wit of deepest Hell, which makes a Sword Of God's own Word, to fight with God the Word: 218 Appointed thus: I grant, said he, that thy Reply was true, yet answer'd not my Doubts. Lo here a scene where thou may'st satisfy By one Experiment all scrupulous thoughts. If God thy father be, leap down from hence, In witness of thy filial Confidence. 219 Is it not Written, that He shall command His Angels' trusty Care to wait on thee, And with a watchful ready-stretchéd hand In every Danger's sute thy bail to be, That no rude stone with churlish shock may meet (So tender is He) thy securéd feet? 220 Mark Psyche, mark the Cheater's craft, how he Mangles the Text, and skips what spoils his plot: In all thy ways they shall thy Keepers be; So ran the tenor of that Scripture: but He knew that desperate Precipices were No Ways for Men who walk'd in holy fear. 221 Be sure it move thee not, if henceforth thou See'st any of his Urcheons Scripture spit: Who by their Master's jugling copy know Both how to clip and to adulterate it: Or else such peevish cunning glosses make As it against it self shall force to speak. 222 They this Authority will quote, to throw That royal Power flat it first set up; And from their thrones urge sacred Kings to bow, And to their reverend lyes make Scepters stoop: By this the Church her self they from her own Fair pinnacle will try to tumble down. 223 But with another genuine Text thy Lord Nobly confuted him, and thus reply'd: This Law's enacted in th'authentick Word, Thou shalt not tempt thy God: and Heav'n forbid That I should dare his Providence, and think When down I plunge my self, I cannot sink. 224 Perhaps thy wonder asks, why Satan, now He had on Danger's brink thy Savior set, Brideled his fury, and forbore to throw Him headlong thence: but thou must not forget That still his guilty breast was jealous least His foe at force of arms might get the best. 225 Alas the chain of all his power is short: Believe it Psyche, there's no mortal Wight But, if resolv'd to hold his Virtues' fort, May tire his siege, and all his onsetes slight: But silly Cowards to his strength make way Whilst they by lazy fears themselves betray. 226 Repulséd thus, the Tempter in his heart Stifl'd his grief and smotheréd his shame: And now inforc'd to act another part, Leap'd on the cloud upon whose back he came, With which he through Air's wondring regions swum Hurrying thy patient Lord along with him. 227 To his expecting Train he swum; for now Put to his last reserve of plots, he ment To venture all at one great cast; and though Still loth his Elves should see him foild, he went With desperate resolution to the fight; Dear was his credit, but more dear his spight. 228 Up to a Mount he march'd, whose stately head Despiséd Basan, Carmel, Libanus, The Alpes where Winter always keeps his bed, With Pendle, Calpe, Atlas, Caucasus, And all the proudest cliffs of Ararat Where Noah's floating Ark first footing got. 229 A Mount which on the highest Clouds look'd down, And saw all kinds of Weather far below; A Mount which rose like Earth's imperial Crown, Where never any Wind aspir'd to blow; A Mount which bravely reach'd at heav'n and made Far distant Countrys subject to its shade. 230 Arrivéd there; with three new plates of brass His never-blushing front he fortify'd; Being now upon an Enterprise which was Brother to that in impudence and pride When arm'd with spightful fury and disdain He ventur'd to assail Heav'n's Sovereign. 231 The same great Son it was of Glory's Father, To whom his stomach then refus'd to yield Free and ingenuous homage, choosing rather To try it with him in a pitchéd field. Fool, who though beat at first, no warning took For what he was, in following fights to look. 232 A massy throne of beaten gold upon A pavement of refinéd silver stood; Which round about that gorgeous region Pouréd the plenitude of Glory's flood. Triumphant Arcs and Collumns on each side In Laurel wreaths hid and display'd their pride. 233 Ten thousand splendid things, which bravely check'd The brightest Diamond's count'nance, as obscure; With dazeling Awe and Majesty bedeck'd A spacious Canopy, which fastned sure Upon the Stars, its neighbours, hover'd right Above the throne, and vaild it o'er with light. 234 Here Satan pitch'd him down: when lo, the crew Of his attending Imps in humble guise Themselves before his radiant footstool threw Adoring him with millions of Lies: Nor durst they from the pavement stir, until His Nod had signify'd his gracious Will. 235 Then reaching forth his hand, he gave the sign To that brave Apparition which he By sprightful art had tutor'd to combine With his profound but glorious Forgery: One moment did the feat; for all the Scene Before his hand was quite stretch'd out, came in. 236 A mighty Globe roll'd fairly up the hill, Where, upon Poles unknown, it turn'd before His throne's proud face, and to that bulk did swell That all the World's full countenance it wore. No Conjurations ever grew so strong As in this Witcherie's universal Throng. 237 There might you see the East's illustrious shore, The Western Columns and th'Atlantick Sea; The Snow's and Ice's never thawing store High heapéd in the north Extremity; The Dogstar's Empire; and the Lybian strand Where endless Summer boileth in the sand. 238 There precious Indus washéd up his gems, There wealthy Tagus pav'd his shores with gold, There Vistula look'd brave in silver streams, There Ganges, Ister, and Orontes roll'd, Hydaspes, Tanais, Rhone, Rhene, Niger, Po, Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, and thousand moe. 239 In milk and honey there swum Palestine, There shadow'd with her odoriferous Cloud, Arabia's Felicity did shine; There Scythia in her furs her self did shroud; There Neptune chose thine Albion for his bride, And plac'd her, as a better World, aside. 240 There dwelt all Countries which your Traffick knows, And more than yet must to its knowledge come: But when young Avarice past her nonage grows, And thinks her thirsty Purse hath more than room For this scant World, another shall be found, Which yet the West in ignorance hath drown'd. 241 But in this ample Pageant was display'd That fatal World which future times shall see By venturous Columbus' art betray'd To Christian Covetousness and Cruelty. (O why should Christians' Estimation hold The Western Souls less dear than Western Gold!) 242 Yea, and those vaster Regions, which far From Africk and from Asia ran away, And the South's remoter bosom were Lock'd up and treasuréd so close, that they Shall longest 'scape Discoverie's reach, and be From Navigation's bold incroachments free. 243 No sooner had the Globe turn'd round about, And every Kingdom's proudest Glory shown: But from his Rome Tiberius steppéd out; And humbling from his head to's hand, his Crown, With fear and reverence his approaches made To Satan's footstool, where his lips he laid. 244 Then having prefac'd by that lowly kiss, Behold, dread Sir, my Diadem, said he, Bows to thy royal Pedestal: by this The highest of Assurances, to Thee I, who am in thy Roman World thy great Viceroy, my homage tender at thy feet. 245 Impowred by thy sovereign Might alone Th'Assyrian Lyon made the World his prey: By thee the Persian Bear's Dominion Through all the forests of the earth made way: By Thee the Grecian Leopard snatch'd all this, And stoutly wish'd another World were his. 246 By Thee the Iron-jaw'd ten-hornéd Beast, The martial Roman, so prevailing grew, That having torn and swallow'd all the rest, He with the Sun victoriously flew About the World, which now sits safe and sings Under the shadow of our Eagle's wings. 247 By Thee great Julius did our Empire found; By Thee Augustus fully rais'd its frame; By Thee were these my loyal Temples crown'd With this, the shadow of thy Diadem. O may thy Vassal with thy favour, and Thy Blessing, wear the Gift of thine own hand. 248 So with a thousand Holocausts will I Make fat thy holy Altars morn and night: So my imperial yoke shall always lie Upon my Subjects' shoulders firm, and light, Whilst I by thy auspicious Influence Reign both of Justice and of mildness Prince. 249 Tiberius here some gracious nod expected, As his Commission to resume his Crown. But strait he saw his flattering Suit rejected, And his fair hopes damp'd by a cloudy frown: Which cloud into a suddain Tempest broke, Whilst Satan thus his indignation spoke. 250 Thou hast depos'd thy self, Tiberius, by Acknowledging that I thy Sovereign am: For how shall I intrust a World in thy Luxuriant lazy hand, who hither came Upon no business but a Visitation; Which bids the Earth now look for Reformation. 251 And well it may: Alas poor Earth, that I So long delay'd to visit sickly Thee, Through most unhappy confidence that my Vicegerent had his Office known, and Me. But though ignoble He betrays his trust, I still must be my self, and that is Just. 252 Then since my Name, my Honor, and my Care Of my dear World all summon me to find Some Hero's worthy Temples, which may wear That Crown according to my princely mind, Be 't so: and thou Tiberius, thank my love That I with it thy head do not remove. 253 Here turning to thy Spouse his kinder eye, My courteous fortune I must thank, said He, Who in my Progress hath so luckily To my not poor acquaintance offered thee. I little thought, till this survey I took, That I a new Lieutenant had to look. 254 By Him I see how easily Princes slide Down the glib paths of heedless Luxury: And what can silly People do, whose guide Leads them the way to Ruin have not I Just cause to choose some sober Man whose care May stop that vicious desperate career! 255 Now whether thou art Son to God, or no, Surely thou spring'st from some heroick Race; The noblest Rays of Honor sparkle so In thy though pinéd yet most princely face: Although thy Modesty conceals thy Birth, And Parentage, it cannot cloud thy worth. 256 And yet that Virtue's precious too; for well I know that stomachful Ambition threw From Heav'n's high Turret to profoundest Hell Disdainful Lucifer and all his Crew. But still the miracle which doth advance My wonder highest, is thy Temperance. 257 That Excellence, alone can never dwell, But proves the fertile spring of all the rest. How readily a temperate Prince may quell Sin's breeding Surfeits in their nasty nest, Whilst all his Life's an exemplary Law Which sweetly leads, when Statutes cannot draw! 258 And such a Prince, and none but such, can cure The wide Contagion which rank vice hath spread On this poor Age; nor can my love endure Longer delay, since I am furnishéd With Thee, whose merits on my Justice call To make thee Deputy of all this All. 259 Nay more than so: Thou seest how Age doth grow Upon my weary back; and I confess I cloyed feel my self and tiréd now With Glorie's Sweets and Honor's Weight, no less Than with my years, and could contented be To end my days in quiet Privacy. 260 Nor must it be in vain, that I have found An Hero on whose shoulders safely I May trust the Burden of my Cares, and ground Just hopes of all my World's felicity. Wherefore this free and solemn Act I make Before Heav'n's face which I to witness take: 261 First, I bequeath to Thee Tiberius' Crown; To which imperial Rome's vast Pow'r is ty'd: Next I surrender to thine Head mine own High Diadem: for thou henceforth shalt ride In this my royal Chariot, and run In thine own Orb together with the Sun. 262 For wheresoe'r he sets or rises, He Shall upon none but thy Dominions shine. His Master long ago bequeath'd to me This Monarchy below; and what is mine Though I to whom I please might give, yet thy Desert binds up my choice's liberty. 263 These Glories which inrich that rolling Ball Are but the beams of that which shall be thine. The Kingdoms which are spread from pole to pole, Shall in thy universal Realm combine: And in requital of thy noble Fast The World shall join its store to dress thy feast. 264 My Legions here shall swear, so shall my Peers, (And I my self will tender them the oath,) Allegiance both to Thee, and to thy Heirs. Yea to complete my grand Donation, both My shrines and Temples I to thee resign; No Name shall there adoréd be but Thine. 265 Nor will I any constant homage tie To this my Grant; for all I mean to ask Is one bare token of thy thanks, which I As ample Pay will construe; and this task Shall be as short as easy: fall but down And worship me, and all the World's thine own. 266 So spake the King of craft: whose staring Train Question'd the honesty of their own eyes, In which this Prince elect appear'd so plain And poor a worm: for these strange fallacies O wily Belzebub were too profound For their short Apprehensions to sound. 267 But as the gentle sweetly-swelling Sea Which rolls above the Spheres, when daring Men Affronted God with towring Villany, Forgot its ever-polish'd smiles, and in Tempestous violence breaking through the shore Of Heav'n, a flood of death on earth did poure. 268 So thy provokéd Spouse, who never yet Had suffer'd frowns to gather on his brow, An angry look against the Tempter knit, And with disdainful Answer made him know That all his Pageantry could not conceal His ugly self who fouler makes his Hell. 269 Bold Satan, 'tis enough that I, said he, Thus long have seen and born thine insolence: Lo I defie thy foolish Baits and Thee Vainer than they: hence fond Impostor, hence Behind my back, and there thy shameless pride (If any place may hide it) learn to hide. 270 Do's not Religion's Law, the Scripture, say, Thine Adoration thou to God shalt give, And at his feet alone thy service pay? All Heav'n forbid that I should Him bereve Of his due homage, and imbezil it Upon the Tyrant of th'infernal Pit. 271 As when on Sodom's Impudence of old Heav'n pour'd its fire to purge their lustful flames, The wretched Town repented not, yet howl'd And mix'd its tears amongst the brimstone streams; But all in vain, for Men and City in One funeral pile were buried with their Sin. 272 So at the Lightning of thy Lord's Reply This frighted Globe of Cheats made haste to melt And nothing of this Universal Lye Remain'd, but Ashes; whose strong vapor smelt So hideously rank, that ev'n the steam Of Stinck her self, to this would Odours seem. 273 Confounded Satan backward from his throne Fell down the Mount, and tumbled towards hell: To all the Deeps he by his bellowing Groan Dismally rung his woful Comming's knell. And in his fall, his Horns, and Tail, and Claws Brake out; so did the Sulphure from his Jaws. 274 His yelling Peers and lamentable Crew Of Legions, justled headlong after Him: Presenting to thy Lord's victorious view A Copy of that sight, when from the brim Of highest Heav'n their King with them He beat Down to the bottom of their damnéd Seat. 275 Thus changéd was the scene: and Satan who Sought by his God to be adoréd, pay'd That God this seemly Adoration. So Great JESU, may all Treasons be betray'd; So may all Rebels find their shameless feet Snarléd for evermore in their own Net. 276 In these three Conflicts, Heav'n with tender eye Upon its Champion waited; yet reliev'd Him with no Seconds, till the Victory By his own single valour was atchiev'd: But then flew down an Host, whose highstrain'd Lays Back to the spheres return'd the Victor's praise. 277 O Psyche, had'st thou heard their royal Song, Thou might'st have learn'd how we above employ Our blesséd time, where on each warbling Tongue Sit endless Raptures of excessive Joy; Whilst every hearty Angel, as he sings, Claps his Applause with his exultant wings. 278 Their Gratulation ended; on their knees A sumptuous Banquet they to him present, Stor'd with the choice of all varieties Which best might recompense his rigid Lent: And He, in whom all princely graces reign, Was pleas'd their ministry not to disdain. 279 But when He thus had broke his mighty fast, The fury which so long possest his breast Impatient fretting Famin, out he cast, Remanding her unto her odious Nest; And bid an Angel tie her in that chain, When he had kick'd her to her den again. 280 There must she dwell past hopes of gitting loose But when He's pleas'd (because displeas'd,) to let Vengeance break out on his relentless foes Whom lusty fatness makes too bold and great To be his Subjects, and adore a Prince Who in his Laws enacteth Abstinence. 281 But from the Lists of this renownéd fight. Th'eternal Spirit's Conduct wafted Him To Galilee's known coasts: to which he might As soon on his own Power's wings have swum; But Heav'n was studious to attend him, and In his great bus'ness joy'd to have a hand. 282 Another World of wonders will appear When we shall launch into that Legend's Sea? But now repose and cheer thy spirits here Against that Voyage: for thy Piety Shall take at leisure solemn time and place Wherein thy Spouse's fasting steps to trace. 283 This said; He spread his ready wing before His Pupil, and on that fair table set, Out of his own unseen but copious store A neat supply of chastly-pleasant meat. She blest her Lord, whose favour granted her A Banquet on his own Fast's theater. 284 But whilst on those external Cates she fed, Her Soul was sitting at a secret Feast With all this Storie's Dainties furnishéd Which faithful Memory anew had drest. And well she knew (which much advanc'd the Cheer) Her Spouse did fast not for Himself but Her. 285 And now, since Phebus hastned to his rest And smoak'd already in the Western Deep, Phylax his chariot curtains drew, and prest The Virgin's eyes to do as much by Sleep: One wing beneath, and one above her head He laid, and turn'd her Board into her Bed. CANTO X. The Marvels. The ARGUMENT. LOVE to convince the World in whom to lay The treasure of its Hopes and Confidence, Proves by a full and glorious Display What undeniable Omnipotence Dwelt in his Hand, which alway shelter spread On those who to its Sanctuary fled. 1 It is not Beauty, which its blush doth owe To Pix and Pencil's almes: it is no King Who maketh on the stage a russling show, And thunders big imperious words which ring With awful noise about the Scene, when he By his next Exit must a Beggar be. 2 All is not Gold that in a glistering ray Fairly conceals its foul hipocrisy. The garish Meteors, though they display Right-boldly-shining Proofs, will never be Own'd by the Stars for bretheren; nor can The Ape, with all his tricks, be genuin Man. 3 To Maximilian when the Almain Eagle On her strange wings Art's stately homage bare, The brave Dissembler only did inveagle Spectator's faith: for though her pinions were Tutor'd by sprightful springs the air to cut, Alas, ev'n whilst she flew she livéd not. 4 The heady Rebel, though all Texts he skrews To force from Truth confession of a Lye; Though at the bar of Nature's Laws he sues To justify unnatural Liberty; Though Conscience and Religion, the things He overthrows, he for his groundwork brings; 5 Though from Success (a firmer Argument For all th'Odrysian Christian-hating Race,) He pleads the sanctity of his Intent, And makes Heav'n Patron of his hell-bred Cause: In vain strives to transform his hideous Sin, Which makes him still to Lucifer akin. 6 The staring Wizzard never yet could by His mumbling Charms, his heav'n-affronting Wand, His barbarous Words and Figures, form a Lye Able against the face of Truth to stand: Nor can his Master Satan though all Hell He rends or blends, atchieve a Miracle. 7 Oft has he ventur'd and strove hard to tread In those almighty Steps of Heav'n; but still The Paces were so wide, that all he did Was but the proof of his aspiring Will. His Wonders never reach'd above Deceits, With which imprudent eyes and hearts he cheats. 8 For how can he who is himself a Part Of Nature's empire, and must rankéd stand In his created class; by any art His finite Orbs activity transcend! What Power of his own can help his Pride Over his Being's bounded head to ride! 9 God, God alone is King of Nature; and Nature no Sovereign but her own will know: Her ear no sooner drinks in His Command, But strait her knees, and heart, and statutes bow: For, all things must be Natural, says she, Which my Creator's Voice injoineth me. 10 That Voice the Fountain was whence first she sprung, And ever since hath been the Rule whereby She steers her loyal course. That Voice which rung So loud as to wake Vacuity Into a full and mighty World, at ease May in its Parts work Metamorphosies. 11 Yet seldom it unsheaths its Power, but when Some high and singular Design's in hand, Some Mystery of potent Love: and then The Center dares not in its passage stand, But must and will give way, and to the top Of Heaven, in meek submission hasten up. 12 For what's the Center's close-shrunk knot; or what All Heav'n and Earth which round about it cling, If in an equal righteous ballance put With Love, that little Word but mighty Thing? Since they, themselves to Love's sole pleasure ow, How can they to his Will refuse to bow? 13 Full low they bow'd to it, when from the yoke Of cruel Pharaoh, Israel's Seed it drew: Ten famous blows it gave, and every stroke Some part of Nature in proud Egypt slew: At length it roll'd the Sea upon an heap, And op'd the Rebel's graves amidst the Deep. 14 This fertile made the dry-starv'd Wilderness In Miracles: This of Heav'n-kindled flames For Sinai's Temples wreath'd an awful Dress: This taught th'unlikely Rock to melt in streams, Bidding the Desert flow, as it before Had charg'd the Sea to start from either shore. 15 This order'd Heav'n to rain down Angels' Bread, And every morning faithfully fulfil That wonderous task; whence Earth's wide board was spread With candied Cates, which Banquet lasted till The liquorish Sun delighted with the tast On that Ambrosia, daily broke his fast. 16 This made the Wind turn Caterer, and blow The People Flesh: This gave the Cloud command By day as usher in their front to go With cooling shades: This built that walking, and Bright-flaming Pillar, whose convoying Light Commission had to banish Night from Night. 17 The Priest's dread feet This awéd Jordan to Forbear to touch, though through his heart they past: This arm'd meer Sound against proud Jericho And storm'd the City by poor Trumpet's Blast, Whilst those huge Bulwarks which all Rams did scorn, Fell prostrate down, and yielded to the Horn. 18 By This more Power to a feebler Sound, The single Voice of Josua, was given; Which domineer'd amidst the starry Round, Against Day's Gyant barracadoing Heav'n. This made the Clouds their gentle drops forget And storms of Stones on Israel's Enemies spit. 19 For two and forty Months This gave the Keys Of Rain's vast store-house to Elias' hand; No humid Traveller durst trace the skies Without a Pass from Him, whose stern command Quite hardning Nature, plated all the Face Of Earth with iron, and of Heav'n with brass. 20 This This impower'd Elisha to repeal Fate's adamantine Laws, yea even when Himself lay pris'ner under Death's cold seal: For in his Grave, Mortality's own Den, Life's Dispensation he managéd, And by his rotten Bones awak'd the Dead. 21 Yet all these Wonders but Preludiums shew'd, And glimmering Dawns of that all-dazling Day, Which was to crown Time's happy Plenitude, And Miracle's ripe age on Earth display: For then the Word it self came down, and broke From human necks the crueler Egypt's yoke. 22 Decorum's Law requir'd this Time should be Time's Excellence: Those forgeries by which The height of all Poetick Industry Coinéd the Golden Age, and made it rich With fancie's gallantry, could never rise To match this more than Golden Age's price. 23 Phylax resolvéd this bright Truth to shew To his indearéd Charge, with whom (for she Had now awoke) in his swift Coach he flew High through the yielding clouds, and instantly Reach'd Palestine's designéd Zenith, where He curb'd his Steeds, and fix'd th'obedient Air. 24 Psyche admir'd to see the Chariot stand Firm on so thin a floor: But then, said He, This Region lies not only in the hand Of Satan's Power; No, our Authority Is clearer far, though that Usurper here The name of Sovereign presumes to wear. 25 Alas, time was (as he remembers well) When tumbled headlong from our highest Home, He could not stop himself, but helpless fell Through all this Air to his infernal Doom. Indeed he often crawleth back this way, Yet 'tis but like a Thief, to steal his prey. 26 But from this lofty Prospect Thou shalt see The Stages where thy Lord his Wonders did; Not all: their number is too vast to be In one Day's little volume fully read: And yet as many as shall amply prove That all his business in this World was Love. 27 That Tract is Galilee, yon little Town The place where first his Might abroach he set, Where he was pleas'd a Marriage Feast to crown Both with his presence, and approve of it: He, though a Virgin's Son, was careful to Assert himself not to be Wedlock's foe. 28 No; he at first himself contrivéd it, A strong and delicately-sacred Tie, By which indissolubly he might knit Two Bosoms in one Love's Conspiracy. Wedlock's that reverend Knot, by which alone Two are no longer Two, but Both are One. 29 A Knot thy Lord delights to imitate, Though in a purer and more mystick way; Concentring with his Spouse so sweetly, that He blends his Heart with hers, till amorous they Cleave in such unity, as makes the Creature Strangely partaker of its Maker's Nature. 30 A Knot which only hard and troublous proves When knit unequally, and to atchieve Unworthy ends; when free and genuine Loves, (Whose skill is here the best) may not have leave To manage their own trade; when Lust doth wear Affection's face, and Passion domineer. 31 A Knot to which, until the Protoplast A pris'ner was, not all the Joys which grew In blesséd Paradise could dress a Feast Of satisfaction for his Soul: his true And proper Eden was his precious Wife, In whom alone he liv'd his dearer Life. 32 A Knot of silk, yet stronger far than that Which rais'd the fame of Gordius so high; A Knot which to no weapon yields, but what The World's true Conqueror weilds; a Knot which by His uncontroulléd Sithe alone is cut Whom Fate to mow down all the Earth hath set. 33 A Knot which cementeth Affection close Between the Branches and the Root, and binds Up Families in peace; which hanging loose By doubtful Lines, as oft as waspish Minds By Discontent's proud itch were spurréd on, Would split, and into mischief's shivers run. 34 A Knot which Satan gall'd so deep, that he Bewitch'd grave Plato's high-esteeméd Pen To preach the Doctrine of Community, As far more proper for the Weal of Men. But failing in the moderate Pagan's Plot, A desperate Christian's likelier tongue he got. 35 His Antiochean Monster ventur'd to Spit poison on this wholsom Mystery, Avouching Nuptial Union to flow From jarring Hell's invention: Hell, said He, Was that black Shop where Belzebub's own hands First forg'd and fashion'd Matrimonial Bands. 36 Unhappy Saturninus, how hast thou Proved thy self an urcheon of Damnation! What gainst thou else by fetching from below Thy Being's Root, which was of Heaven's Plantation? O most adulterous Soul, whose rank offence Deflowers the Beds of all the World at once! 37 But now, kind JESUS, sitting at the Feast, And adding living Cheer to that dead Meat, (For on his Face the Eyes of every Guest, As on the richer Dainties all were set,) A fit occasion him beseech'd to joyn To that dry Banquet of his Face some Wine. 38 The Wine was out: when lo the Virgin Mother In courteous pity of the Bridegroom's want (Which she more studious was than he to smother) Strait to her Son, the fount of all things, went, And in a blush more lovely than the Bride Could shew her Groom, the bus'ness signify'd. 39 But then her Son, (because not hers alone, But also Heaven's, and purposing to show A token of that high Extraction,) Waving the precious Name of Mother now, Reply'd, Woman, let the Purveyor see To that defect, what is 't to Me or Thee? 40 But marking then how Her abashéd Eye Begg'd pardon for her hasty Intimation, He mollify'd his seeming sharp Reply, By adding this serene Interpretation: 'Tis not thy Charity that I repress, But its unseasonable forwardness. 41 The Bus'ness noble is; for Heav'n and I, Before thy thoughts it enter'd, plotted it: But yet thou needst not lend us wings to flie, Who haste enough can make when haste is fit. The wheels of Time though speedily they run, Mine hour as yet they have not rolléd on. 42 Know, Psyche, that His hour is Mercy's Cue; And at Extremity's last gasping Call, She loves her seasonable Power to shew. The want of Wine was yet not known to all The company, whose Souls it did concern By that, thy Lord's wise Potency to learn. 43 But when that want was grown notorious, He With ready Goodness issued his Command, That six capacious Water-pots should be Fill'd with their own accustom'd Liquor, and Drawn for the Guests: when lo, at every spout The Miracle into the Bowl gush'd out. 44 He who dull Water taught, by thrilling through The conduit of the Vine and of the Grape, To turn to brisk and joyful Wine; did now Teach it as much by running through the Tap. The cool and Virgin Nymph drawn from the Pot, All over blushéd, and grew sparkling hot. 45 The Master of the Feast amazéd at Her looks and spirit, wonder'd whence she came. Never had his judicious Palate yet Discover'd such a purely-sprightful Dame. Not knowing she was made to grace the Feast By Him who nothing gives but what is Best. 46 And sure I am that in thy pious Ear The bare narration relisheth so well, That with thy thirsty Soul thou drink'st thy share, And tast's the sweetness of this Miracle. But for these Pots, that thou but turn'st thy Eye, An Ocean of Wonders thou mayst spy. 47 Lo, yonder flows the Sea of Galilee, Upon whose sandy shore, which He had set To curb and discipline its waves, as He Vouchsaf'd to walk, his Eyes an object met Which mov'd his unrequested Piety To wooe the Fisher's to a nobler Sea. 48 Peter and Andrew in that tiresom Main Catching their Living with their Fish he spy'd: In whom he read the tedious state of vain And mudling Man, who in the briney Tide Of this unstable World, his days doth Waste, And with his Net, Himself into it cast. 49 So certainly Uncertainty upon Life's lubrick stage, has learn'd to domineer; Proud Change in such confounding sport doth run Here sometimes flowing, sometimes ebbing there; That solid Earth, no less than fluid Sea Seems at unsetled Luna's beck to be. 50 This made Him call aloud, Come, follow me, And I will you embarck upon the shore, Yet in a safer, profitabler Sea Than you have ever fishéd in before. Let those mute Things alone, and I will teach You speaking Fishes readily to catch. 51 The shoals of Men which in this Age's stream, Busily scud, as thick and fast shall flow, Not to those frail and feeble Nets, but them Which Heav'n's Almigty hand shall weave for you; Immortal Nets, which know not how to break; Nets which the universal World shall take. 52 Scorn, scorn that crazy Hulk of yours; for I Am come to rig a Royal Ship, in which You round this mighty Globe, being steeréd by My watchful Providence, shall safely reach. When Heav'n fears being shipwrack'd, then shall this Stout Bark, which nothing but Heav'n's Kingdom is. 53 Hast thou not heard how Syrens' Airs have blown Fond Fishers from their Boats into the Sea; In whose sharp billows they their Captives drown, Drownéd before in their soft Harmony? Well then might this strong Charme those Men invite Into the Ocean of safe Delight. 54 Once more their Nets they cast, but Cast away; Meekly ambitious to be Fishes now, And render up themselves his joyful prey, Who thus his Net of Love about him threw. Never adventure had they made like this, Where being caught themselves they catch'd their Bliss. 55 They catch'd their Bliss; and though their Anchors held Their Vessel fast, yet could it not detain Its ravish'd Owners, who made haste to yield To this new Trade of more assuréd gain. But, Psyche, yonder Place will tell thee how Wonders by Land as well's by Sea did flow. 56 For there was seiz'd a fairer harder Prize, And seizéd from Exaction's sturdy throne; Where Levi sate, Lord of a strange Excise, The heavy mark of Rome's Dominion: A Knight was he, for none but such were held Fitting that Legal Cruelty to weild. 57 That kindly calléd by thy lovely Lord, Fishers were well content their Bark to leave, Less ground to sober wonder doth afford; Their cold and wet and dirty Trade might drive Them to an easy Faith, their old Degree Of Life, by any new advanc'd would be. 58 A Faith, which in the dregs of Time, so far Abus'd would be, that bold Mechanicks, who In poor and painful toil ingagéd were, When Sloth and Pride make them too worthy to Buckle to work, their tools away will throw, And by this Call, inspir'd Men-fishers grow. 59 But what, what Charms can Golden Chains outvy, And break those strong and precious Links which now Held Levi in such dear Captivity, That ev'n his Soul close pris'ner was: or how Can this Poor Master such a Man persuade To leave Great Cesar, and his thriving Trade. 60 A stubborn Mountain may more easily be Convincéd to resign his native place, And heave his mouldering bulk into the Sea: The Sun may sooner from his princely face Be won to tear his golden Tire, and damp With Midnight nasty foot his highnoon Lamp. 61 Yet, passing by the Office, He no more Artillery, but this only Word let fly, Come, Follow me; which forthwith overbore, In spight of all reluctant Policy, The startled Seat, the Profit, and the Man, And turn'd into a Saint the Publican. 62 He spins out no prudential stay to clear His busy Book, to set his Reck'nings right, And all his parcels up to sum: for here His dearest Total walkéd in his sight; And no Account he makes but only this, That now from Money he remov'd to Bliss. 63 The World's opinion he revolvéd not, Nor how Tiberius this Affront might take; He weighed not what would be lost, or what Would not be gain'd; he begs no time to seek His Friend's advice how he his fame might keep, Nor lingereth to look before he leap. 64 As from its clogging horrible Abyss, The World at JESU's Call its head did rear; So from the blacker deeper mass of his Confuséd Mammon Levi mounteth here, And bravely follows Him without delay Who was himself his Leader and his Way. 65 For Love like Lightning from thy Spouse's Eyes, Shooting its active sweetness through his Heart, Into its own obedient Sacrifice, Whate'r it met did instantly convert. So sublimate and so refining was That Fire, that all the Gold it turn'd to Dross. 66 Doubts, Fears, and Cares, and secular Relations It quite burnt up; and in his flaming Breast, Left nothing but the noble Exultations Of valiant Zeal, which, should its course be crost, Though with the cumbrous bulk of Earth and Sea, Would rend its way through all, and Victor be. 67 Love, Psyche, Love is that most Potent Thing, To which all other Strength its head submits. Hence 'tis, that though the Universe's King Omnipotence's glorious Title fits, Yet in this sweeter Name of Higher Might (For God is Love) he takes his prime delight. 68 Thy Lord his Ordinary Chaplains thus Call'd out; and Twelve their Mystick number was: For with this Zodiack He contriv'd to dress His Grace's Orb through which He meant to pass; That in as many Signs Himself might run About his World as do's the other Sun. 69 In which selected Twelve there wanted not A peevish scorpion too, which daily bit The Hand that him had foster'd; and his hot Invidious venom at his Patron spit; Proving at length in matchless height of Evil Against Incarnate God, Incarnate Devil. 70 Yet such was JESU's most untiréd Love, That still he persever'd all stones to roll, Which might that one in Judas' Bosom move, And mollify his most obdurate Soul. For Heav'n forbid that Pity's Lord should fashion A way to plunge him deeper in Damnation. 71 O no! may those black Mouths for ever be Damm'd up with silence, and with shame, which dare Father the foulest deepest Tyranny On Love's great God; and needs will make it clear From his own Word: thus rendring Him at once Both Cruelty's and Contradiction's Prince. 72 A Prince whose mocking Law forbids, what yet Is his eternally-resolvéd Will; Who wooes and tantalizes Souls to get Up into Heav'n, yet destines them to Hell; Who calls them forth whom he keeps lockéd in; Who damns the Sinner, yet ordains the Sin. 73 Right Egypt's God, the barbarous Crocodile, Whose weeping Eye the preface drops to that Destruction, which his own devouring will Determin'd has. But, Psyche, never let That thought thy bosom taint, That Heav'n contrives Those Crimes and Punishments, for which it grieves. 74 When goodly Vines shall Thorns' vile Mothers be; And glorious Titan Father of dull Night; When ugly Ink's obscure Nativity Is lineally descended from the white Womb of Sarmatian Snow; then; nay not then, May God the Parent be of bastard Sin. 75 But all the rest were faithful Souls, who stood True to their Master's Cause, and joy'd to write Its confirmation in their dearest Blood, As He had done in his: the sharpest fight They counted sweetest; glorying that they His Death might by their own in part repay. 76 The first of these was Zebedee's first Son, To whom proud Herod's Sword the way cut ope, And gave him leave that noble Race to run, Which leadeth straight to Heav'n's illustrious top. How little dream'd the Tyrant that he did Put on his Crown when off he took his Head! 77 The next was Philip, who with zealous heat Flew to the North, and hunted out the Ice From those dull Hearts which ne'r with Heav'n did beat, But in congealéd stupid Ignorance freeze: For his large scene was rudest Scythia, where December takes his walk through all the year. 78 When He that Winter all on Fire had set With Christian flames; his Fervor brake into A Clime which warmer Tempers promis'd, but At his Life's price he found them colder grow: He found that more than Scythia's barbarous Ice Bound up the Heart of Hierapolis. 79 Jove's Name had left no room for JESUS there And when he tells the People, of the Shames, The Nails, the Cross, his Lord for them did bear, He his own Torment's list aforehand names: Enough of JESUS now, said they, for we Will quickly make as good a God of thee. 80 Then piercing, first with cruel Taunts his Ear, And next with Nails his sacred Hands and Feet, With acclamations up his Cross they rear; Where being placéd as their fury's Butt, Of flints (less flinty than themselves) upon him Pouring a tempest, into Heav'n they stone him. 81 Thomas, whose Doubts had fix'd his Faith so fast, That neither Life nor Death its root could shake; With JESUS in his Mouth through Parthia past And charm'd what Rome could never pliant make. Then having also rous'd the Æthiops, He Resolv'd to reach the World's extremity. 82 He sadly markéd how the greedy West Into the East was drawn by thirst of Gold, Which had the Sun's and Nature's courses crost, And into Indus' Mouth the Ocean roll'd: And will none venture, there said He, to win A fairer prize than that, the Souls of Men? 83 Sure Indian Souls of purer metal are, Than that which Avarice so far adores. Thomas will thither trade, though India were Distant more worlds than one from Jordan's shores. For in his zealous sails God's Spirit blows, And not to fetch but carry Gold he goes. 84 If Gold be not too poor a Name to print Upon such royal Wares as Glory, Bliss, Love, Patience, Purity, divine Content, And every Sweet of sweetest Paradise: For these, and more than these, inshrinéd lie In JESU's Name, Heav'n's best Epitomy. 85 With this he traded to make India rich, And not himself, who now could not be poor, As having more than All, though not so much As any thing lay'd up in prudent store: He knew his Lord was Plenty's King, and He Counts as his own his Master's Treasury. 86 Close to this noble Work the Heroe fell, And having fairly op'd his Merchandize, Come buy, saith he; for though these Wares excel Your glittering Ore's too much adoréd price, Yet you on Trust may go for all this Bliss, Give but your Faith, and yours the Treasure is. 87 A Treasure so inestimably pure As neither moth can fret, nor rust devour: A Treasure most invincibly secure From pilferers' sly and robbers' open power. Yet though so precious; 'tis not I, but He Deserves your thanks, who sends it you by me. 88 The Brachmans wonder'd at the Generous Man; So did the Sage Gymnosophists: until Blindness with spight combined, hurried on A barbarous Faction, to seize and kill The wondrous Merchant; who as ready stood To pour it forth, as they to suck his Blood. 89 Arm'd with their King's consent, and with their Spears, Into his Heart they ope their murderous way: Which wounds he with contented patience bears, And for his doubting Hand returns this pay; Remembring well how deep, till thus he dy'd, It stood in debt to his Dear Master's Side. 90 The younger James, whose noble Pedigree Advanc'd him to be Brother to his Lord, Much nearer grew of kin by Piety: No Saint with stouter fervor Him ador'd, Nor with more resolute constancy than he; Witness his reverend Forehead and his Knee. 91 His Knee; thick plated with Austerity, Which day and night all naked dwelt upon The Temple's floor, till it arriv'd to vie In hardness with its cushion of stone. There never grew on painful Camel's Knees A stiffer Proof of Patience, than on His. 92 His Forehead; deeply sealéd with the same Stamp of severest zeal, whilst prostrate He Accustom'd to his Soul's his Body's frame. O sacred Impudence of Humility! As wicked Foreheads arm themselves in Brass, His pious Front in Brawn immuréd was. 93 (A Brawn, which shall hereafter check their Pride And senseless Superstition, who in New Devotion pertly will the Old deride, And hold no Worship from the Body due; But, in pretence their Conscience tender is, Maintain their dainty Flesh's Tenderness. 94 Who on the Spirit boldly score up all Religion's work; and whilst they sit at ease, Would have the World believe they humbly fall On their adoring Soul's devouter knees: Forgetting that the Tree must needs be dead, Whose sap into no open fruit will spread.) 95 His dearest meat and drink was to obey His Master's pleasure: Ne'r did Blood of Grape Stain his abstemious Cup, and slily lay An ambush for his Reason: mean and cheap His liquor was, for Virgin Fountains were His only Cellars, and his only Beer. 96 Ne'r could the rampant Flesh, of Birds, or Beasts Get leave to reak upon his temperate Board: Chaste Moderation cookéd all his Feasts, And well she knew how to content her Lord; His highest fare were sober modest Fishes; Where Water serv'd for Beer, the aptest Dishes. 97 His Skin perfuméd Unguents ne'r bedew'd With supple Flattery of delicious sweat: Unmanly Baths his Body never stew'd, Cheating his Vigor with effeminate heat: His Limbs in active linen lov'd to dwell, And ne'r were muffled up, and lost in Wool. 98 Nor was that Linen Robe, though coarse and plain, Contemnéd in the People's Eyes, for they On bended knees were suters to obtain His Grace, their off'rings on its Hem to lay, That on that Altar of Humility, Their Lips and Kisses they might sanctify. 99 O how imperious is Meek Piety, Whether it will or no, commanding all Spectators into Love and Reverence! He Who at true Honor reacheth, must let fall His other Plumes, and wisely learn to dress Body and Soul in humble Holiness. 100 For when did Pride and fond Ambition scape The vengeance both of Hatred and Disdain And when did Glory fail her self to heap Upon his Head, who meekly could refrain From climbing Honor's ladder, and his own Desert by rigid Wisdom presséd down? 101 Nay, surly He who on the Priesthood's crest Sits perch'd, of James his Worth convincéd is; And finding Him the higher holier Priest, Makes free the Oracle to his access. Thus Heav'n's abstrusest Cabinet, the Glory Of all the Earth, became his Oratory. 102 James was the truer Priest indeed: for now The ancient Priesthood with the Vail was torn; The Diadem too was fall'n from Judah's brow, And Salem's royal Splendor lay forlorn: This made him there erect the sacred throne Of his Episcopal Dominion. 103 Yet are the Northern Winds, and Irish Seas More trusty things than Jews: the Jews to day Can heap their kisses and their courtesies On him whom they to morrow will betray: Jews' mouths this hour upon thy Praises' text Can fairly preach, and suck thy blood the next. 104 With acclamations they this Saint had set In state upon their Temple's battlement; And there no sooner he asserts his great Ascended Lord, but in one mad consent Of rage they throw him down, and from his veins; His heart, his head, dash blood, and life, and brains. 105 Zelotes, and Thaddæus, that brave Pair, When He in Egypt preachéd had, and He From Tigris to Euphrates, joinéd were To reap in Persia their felicity: This was the Crown of Martyrdom, which in The Quarrel of Heav'n's King they nobley won. 106 Peter, the Leader of that glorious Troop, When he had fix'd the Antiochean Seat, His more renownéd Throne set stoutly up In Cesar's conquering City; where the great Irradiations of his fame did call Rome's brightest Strength to try with him a fall: 107 That Strength was Simon, whose Apostasy From Truth in Magick's Deeps had plung'd him down; But more in desperate Lies and Blasphemy, Whilst all that's God's he claiméd as his own, And left no Trinity in Heav'n, but by Strange impudence usurp'd that Mystery. 108 The Father in Samaria, the Son In Jewry, and in all the World beside He vouch'd himself the Spirit: yet alone Pretended not ability to guide His own creating Hand, but when he made His Angels, granted he had Helen's aid. 109 He knew the surest way he had to gain His Whore, was to exalt her to his throne, And in his Godship let her Partner reign. Besides, to help on his Production Of blasphemous heretick Portents, Hell Thought Females useful then; and always will. 110 And so the World will say, when once 't has known Priscilla, Maximilla, and the Pair Of Philumens, with Elxai's double Spawn Marthus and Marthan. For her wretched share In such Deceits some Eve will still come in, As Helen here did into Simon's Sin. 111 He woo'd his Scholars in Himself and Her To treasure up the hopes of their Salvation; And heedless Souls the surer to insnare, He freely loos'd the reins to every Passion; No matter how you live or die, said He, If once your Faith builds on my Grace and Me. 112 For what, alas, are all the fairest-faced And goodlyest-featur'd Works which men atchieve, But hidious Sins, unrighteously graced With Righteousnesse's Name? But they who leave Those putrid Props, and trust in Me alone, Ingage my Power to become their own. 113 This was that Champion, by whose magick skill Him God indeed, befooléd Nero thought, And pray'd him by some signal Miracle To dash those daring Wonders Peter wrought. To which request his Credit bid him yield, And set the Day when he would fight the field. 114 The Day is come; and Simon boldly makes The Challenge, which was, Up to heav'n to fly. With that, his Arms he weighs, and spreads, and takes His unwing'd flight: but throws his scornful eye Down upon Peter, whom into the hands Of Nero's Justice proudly he commends. 115 The Clouds had gather'd thick about the sky To guard fair Heav'n against his foul Intrusion; Yet their battalia he broke, and by His working arms unto his high Delusion Forc'd ope the way. The People, as he went, Their wonder after him, and worship sent. 116 But as the never-beaten fencer lets His bold capricious Combatant grow high, Before he will in earnest strike, and gets A later but a nobler Victory: So Peter suffers him to sore, till he Might high enough for's fatal Downfal be. 117 Then posting after him with mighty Prayers, His Coach of unseen Devils from him he tore: Forthwith down headlong his aerial stayers The Conjurer fell, and sprauléd on the floor; Where batter'd, brus'd, and in himself imbrewed, His black blood and his blacker soul he spewed. 118 So when heav'n-daring Lucifer himself Try'd in the flaming face of God to fly, His singéd wings betray'd the venturous Elf, And down he plung'd into the Misery Of endless Death. And may his followers all For ever towre up to no other fall. 119 Strait in the People's Mouths the Devils cry, Peter our God hath by enchantments slain: And by this loud unreasonable Lye, For Him who earn'd a Crown, a Cross obtain. Unhappy Rome, who hast converted thus Thy highest Gain into thy deepest Loss. 120 For thou no sooner gainst thy Freedom from That Wizzard's cheats, but thou betray'st thine own Deliverer: if wretched Simon, whom Thou seest by Peter's mighty Prayers thrown Beneath a Man, were yet a God; O why Is Peter not the greater Deity? 121 Yet He cries out, This Altar is too rich For Me, so poor and vile a Sacrifice: Was't not the Cross, the glorious Cross, on which My Master pay'd the World's renownéd Price! Sure were some gallant Seraph here to die, This Engine would his Passion dignify. 122 Yet if I must thus high aspire; may my Unworthiness at least have leave to show That I desir'd not in this pomp to die: So hang me that my reverend Head below May pay its final kisses on the Feet Of my most Royal Savior's dying Seat. 123 Nero to such Requests as these was free, And glad besides that he had learn'd a way To cross and double Crucifixion: He Commands his Sergeants not to disobey The Wretch's wild desire, but, so he dy'd, To let him any way be crucify'd. 124 Thus nail'd on his reverséd Tree, with Eyes Quite turn'd (as was his Heart) from things below The Saint looks down to Heav'n, and smiling dies; Malgre his Nails' resistance, able now That Place, at which his Feet were aim'd, to gain; A Footstool Simon's ventur'd at in vain. 125 Andrew, his Brother both in Nature's and In Zeal's and Piety's (much straiter) knot, Display'd through Thrace to Scythia's furthest Strand The beams of Grace's Day, so fairly that It startled, and surpriz'd with holy fright The dark Barbarians in their northern Night. 126 Thence into Greece the restless Preacher came, Arrogant Greece, who though she ranks her own Quite counter to the scorn'd Barbarian Name, Yet now more cruel was and salvage grown Than Thrace or Scythia: O that famous Arts Should raise Men's Wits, and yet debase their Hearts. 127 Achaia smil'd, and with disdainful mirth Patræ confuted all that Andrew said; His Beggar-god's, poor miserable Birth And viler Death, they scoffingly upbraid. Nor blush'd Ægeus, though Proconsul, he Forward to spur the People's villainy. 128 A Cross they make him of a new-found frame, His meek Ambition, or their wanton Spight Projecting it, which thenceforth bare his Name, As Him it did that day: a Cross not right Erected and transverse, but slopingly Thwarted into the figure of a X. 129 A X, the blesséd Letter, which began His Master's Title, and his own: his Cross It self proclaims he dies a Christian: And though the holy Omen to his gross Yet learned Foes were unperceived, He Rejoycéd in his Cross's Mystery. 130 A Cross, which shall inherit such Renown, Wearing his Name, upon it crucify'd, That it the Scotish Heraldry shall crown, And on the top of all its Banners ride. What Glories then shall Saints themselves obtain, If in such state their Suffring's Badges reign! 131 Nail'd fast to this strange Honor was the Saint, Array'd in Scarlet from his own rich Veins: Fond Grecia took it for a torturing Paint, And thought his Cross a fertile Tree of pains; But to a Pulpit He converts that Tree, A Pulpit which did preach as well as He. 132 That preach'd his patient Magnanimity, His meek Obedience, and his brave Content: But more illustrious was the Homily, Which flow'd from his own Lips; so eloquent And so divine, that Life it self upon His dying Tongue seem'd to have built her throne. 133 Long held this Sermon, for his last it was; Two days it measur'd; yet in truth was short: For what are two poor flitting days, alas, To that which doth Eternity import? He preach'd Eternity, to whose fair light He strove his blinded Torturers to invite. 134 But then observing Death forbear to make His wonted haste, it forc'd him to complain: Not that his Pains his Patience had broke, But that his Heart now long'd its Home to gain; Counting himself, where-e'r he was, abroad, Till happily arrivéd at his God. 135 And am I nail'd in vain, dear Lord, said he, To this stout Pillar of renownéd Death? Though not poor I, yet Thou deserv'st for me, That in this honor I may yield my Breath. These potent Words to Heav'n with Violence flew, Whence they of flashing Light a Convoy drew. 136 As in the bosom of his chariot's flames, Blest Phebus sails through his Celestial road; So in the arms of these officious Beams The Saint was carry'd to his high Abode: But yet with this most glorious difference, that Here Andrew riseth never more to set. 137 On zeal's undaunted wings great Barthol'mew To meet Day's flame where first it kindled is, To India's remotest regions flew; And taught the East to bless their wakening eyes By worshiping a nobler Sun whose face Was both the Spring of Glory and of Grace. 138 Then having left his goodly Picture there, By Matthew's Pen drawn fairly in a Book: He posted back into Armenia, where The same illustrious Work in hand he took. But when of Peace's King he 'gan to talk, The Prince grew wroth and thus his Fury spake: 139 Bold wretch, who pratest of the idle throne Of vainer Christ; I'l make thee know that I In my Armenia will have but one, And that's the Seat of my own Majesty. If Jesus be a God, he must be fain To seek some Realm of Beggars where to reign. 140 'Twere special credit for Armenia's King To honor as a mighty Deity A stable-born and manger-cradeled Thing, Whose ignominious Death did justify The vileness of Birth, because a poor Resolvéd doting wretch doth him adore. 141 O no! the Gods by whose great blessing I Possess my Throne and Crown, are Gods enough: Fully enough I'm sure for me: and why Should I go trouble heav'n with more; or throw Away Devotion on this Jesus, who At best but for an useless God must go. 142 He useless is; and so I fear art Thou His correspondent Priest: and yet a way, Perhaps, my Officers may think on how To make of thy vile Nothing Something: say Sergeants, will not this Carrion serve to flea? Though he be naught, yet good his skin may be. 143 That only Word sufficient was to let The Tigres loose; who strait the Saint undress Both of his cloaths and skin which at the feet Of their remorsless Lord they throw; for his Due right it was the Martyr's skin to keep In token that he slew the harmless sheep. 144 But He, though flead, now fairer than before, As stars when strip'd from clouds, with such excess Of lustre sparkled in his glorious Gore As dazell'd by his sacred Nakedness Vex'd Satan's eyes, who wish'd,—to hide the stain Of his own shame,—the skin were on again. 145 In vain he wish'd; for Barthol'mew was now Fit for the Robes of Immortality, Which Jesu's hand as ready was to throw On his deserving back; and happy He Might well expect an easy entrance in At heav'n's strait gate who first put off his skin. 146 But Matthew into Æthiopia ran, Ventring upon a wonderous Enterprise, To purge the swarthy Crow into a Swan, To candy Ink, and Pitch to crystallize, Sables to make traluced, Shadows bright; I mean, to wash the Pagan Negros white. 147 Yet this by Baptism's searching streams he did, Which drown'd their hearts in Life and Purity. Hence came the torrent of his Name to spread And in the chanel of the Court grow high. The Court soon catch'd the News, but little thought That in the News's net it self was caught. 148 Caught was its dearest Gem, the virgin Heart Of Iphigenia, daughter to the King: And now not all the flattering frowning art Of royal Hirtacus from her could wring The least consent her mystick Spouse to leave, And unto him by nuptial cement cleave. 149 No: though the throne of her deceased Sire Was now become his own; for noble She Would to no other Royalty aspire But what she found in Christian Piety; And in that holy Realm she reached high To gain Perfection's sublimity. 150 My solemn Vow, cry'd she, is past, and I My body to my Maker must restore As I receiv'd it; my Virginity Is now intirely His, and mine no more: And such a Queen why will thy Wishes seek, Who to thy bed through Perjury must break? 151 If Me you love, O then love what I am; Love Love himself, or else you love not Me: Be truly Royal, love the Christian Name, And let my sacred Vow still sacred be. For I may to no earthly Spouse be ty'd Who to an heav'nly Bridegroom am affy'd. 152 With wrath and folly blind, the Tyrant saw Not how this Match most matchless was, nor that She had already chose a King: and though Humanity and Courtship suffer'd not His Rage to tear the Princess, yet he swore Her Tutor's blood should pay his Scholar's score. 153 His choisest thirstiest Bloodhounds he dispatch'd With sutable Commission to the Saint; Whom at the mystick Table having catch'd, The floor with his and his Lord's Blood they paint: And at the Altar thus the Martyr dies, Both holy Priest and willing Sacrifice. 154 Matthias, whom heav'n-witness'd Faith commended To traytor Judas his escheated Place; Persuing Matthew's great Design, contended To Æthiopia: but his final Race In Jewry was, where not with sweat, but Blood Besmear'd, his Master's steps to heav'n he trod. 155 John was the last; but first and highest in His dear esteem who is himself Most high: O blessed Soul, in whose delicious shrine Divinity so much rejoyc'd to lie! JESVS indeed lov'd all the rest; but He Not only lov'd, but was in love with Thee. 156 He was in love with thy Virginity With blooming Graces youthfully bedeckt: Of all his Twelve indeared Consorts, He Did for his amorous favours Thee select: His softest nearest Spouse wert Thou, in whose Ingenuous eyes he lov'd his own to loose. 157 He was in love with that reflection Of his own Sweetness shining in thy face; With sympathetick joy he dwelt upon His iterated self in that pure Glass, Resolv'd on it all Lovers Arts to prove: Most happy Saint with whom Love fell in love! 158 From off the troubled main He lured Thee Into the calmest Sea of living Pleasures; The bosom of supream Serenity To which the Ocean is but poor in treasures: His own alprecious Breast He open'd wide And welcom'd Thee to joy's ne'r-ebbing tide. 159 There did'st thou lie and learn thy Soul to glow By that dear copy of thy Pillow's heat; A Pillow in whose soft protection Thou Laidst all thy Cares and fears asleep, and yet Sleep'dst not thy self; for how could any eye Indure to close when Jesus was so nigh! 160 There didst thou lie all next the heart of Love, Heav'n bowing round to shelter thee from harm; Heav'n, not so sweetly now display'd above As folded up in His incircling Arm: Which forc'd all wise Spectators to conclude Thou wert aforehand with Beatitude. 161 Those Stories where the Quire of Seraphs dwels Exalted in felicity's bright sphere, Thy dainty Habitation excels; For at his footstool they lie prostrate there: Amidst the sweets of whose all-balmy breast Thine only Head injoys its glorious Nest. 162 How vast an Army of most strong Delight Beleaguered thy Soul on every side, Whilst thy inamor'd Spouse try'd all the might Of Heav'nly tenderness on his dear Bride: What healing wounds gave his Affection's Dart, How many living Deaths, to thy soft heart! 163 How deeply sealed He himself on Thee By those intire Expressions, which can by No heart be understood, but such as He Instructs in Love's profound Divinity. On his own bosom how did he repose, When his embraces there did Thee inclose! 164 How did He study to epitomize His Incarnation's amorous Design, And sum the best of Mercy's Mysterys Up in thy single soul! in which divine Experiment, it was thine only grace To fill his universal Churche's place. 165 Thus while He liv'd He sweetly liv'd in Thee; And to his Death, when he was nailed fast, He nobly scorned that Mortality Should seize upon his Love: for by his last And tenderest words, while He himself did die, To Thee He left Love's living Legacy. 166 Into his dearest Mother's bosom He Commended Thee, and bid her own her Son: What Nature could not, Love contriv'd to be, And Mary must be Mother unto John: Love had so closely John and Jesus ty'd, That in their Mother they must not divide. 167 Mary no other Glass could find, where she So fair an Image of her Son might read: Nor John so pure a Mirrour meet, where He Might on his Master's graceful picture feed His longing eyes: thus Love though dead and gone, Her Son to Mary leaves, his Spouse to John. 168 No wonder, gentlest Saint, that on thy Tongue Love built his hive, and drop'd his honey thence, Whilst thy soul-charming words present so strong A relish of Heav'n's choisest Influence; That Love from his own wing lent thee the quill Which all thy Lines with Charity doth fill. 169 No wonder Thou brave Eagle soardst so high Making the Sun thy book, in which divine Volume thou read'st the Word's great Mystery, Which dazeling other Eyes, refined thine. No wonder that thy Gospel's Calculation Thou drew'st by none but God's own elevation. 170 No wonder, that Port Latin saw the Oile Scalding in vain: thou who didst live by fire Whilst amorous streams joy'd in thy breast to boil, Couldst feel no other flames: O no! some higher Fervor of Love must melt thine own, and send It to the welknown bosom of thy friend. 171 The languishments of never-faint Desire Must crown thy life with correspondent Death: Though all the Rest through blood and wounds expire This dainty Martyrdom must end thy breath. So Heav'n has privileg'd thy Piety, That thou who liv'dst by love, of Love must die. 172 Pardon me Psyche, that I have thine ear By this Apostrophe detain'd, since John Was by his virgin flaming worth so near Of kin to our Angelick Tribe: and can We mention Him, and no salutes afford To one thus honored by Honor's Lord. 173 And pardon me that I have dwelt so long On his Apostolick Consorts; the glory Of whose Death-scorning Valor do's no wrong, Nor interrupts their Master's royal Story: He, and his Heav'nly Might in them appear'd Who o'r the vanquish'd Earth his Banner rear'd. 174 Thus they who paint the praises of the Beams, Display the commendation of the Sun: When Eloquence's tributary streams After the Silver-thrilling Current run, Their Panegyrick homage they no less Unto the Mother-fountains wealth profess. 175 Mark now that Mount, which lifts its lofty head Near to Bethsaida, taking thence a view Of all the Countries round about it spread; Nor Zebulon nor Nephtali outflew Its prospect's jurisdiction, nor the most Removed skirts of Trachonitis' Coast. 176 Acquaintance also it sublimely took Of other Mountains; unto Hermon, Seir, And stately Libanus it reach'd a look: This was that noble Oratory, where Thy Lord so oft retired, that the Place Thenceforth the Mount of Christ surnamed was. 177 A Mount where liberal Nature did her best: Witness the flowry Beauties smiling there; But Grace far more magnificence exprest Than all that awful Pomp, which dressed for The great Law-giver's feet the flaming head Of Sinai, mix'd with thunder, smoak, and dread. 178 For here no Trumpet spake the frightful Mind Of stern Imperiousness; no rigid Law Back'd with an everlasting Curse, enjoyn'd All shoulders in its galling yoke to draw: But Love himself upon his gentle throne Gave his soft Laws of Benediction. 179 Eight Springs of Blessedness abroach he set, And woo'd the weary World to bathe in them. Their fears he cheer'd, and taught them to transmit, And bury all Solicitude in him: He pass'd his Word, Heav'n should their Purveyor be, Who served in the Wars of Piety. 180 His Evangelical Oeconomy He instituted here; and so improv'd The highest pitch of Legal Sanctity, That though incumbring burdens he remov'd, Yet Bonds of more Perfection on he laid, And wondrous strict his Mercy's Candor made. 181 His Reins were silk, but yet he held them strait, And drove amain; providing by that Art Of loving sharpness, that no charming Bait Might his Disciples lure, and tempt to start Out of the King of Heav'n's High-way, but to His Kingdom safely and directly go. 182 How sternly vain and foolishly severe Appears the solemn Stoick's Discipline, If duly weigh'd with this enacted here! Grant that the Porch; the Sacred and Divine Temple itself was this: That fram'd of none But rude, This though of hard yet polish'd Stone. 183 Christ's Blessed Rules, and none but his, are they Which past the Purity of Gold refine Gross mortal Bosoms, sublimating Clay, Till with Angelick Claritude it shine; Whilst by his Spirit he scours off sinful Rust, And into Heav'n blows up the purged Dust. 184 Turn now, and view those desart Fields which lie Next neighbours to the Galilean Sea: Into the quiet of whose privacy Devotion had withdrawn thy Spouse: but He Had given the People too much taste of his Sweetness, to think he long could scape their press. 185 For as the busy Bees who once have found A fragrant Garden, haunt it day by day, Hunting out every flower, and humming round About the tops of their delicious prey: So to that Garden (such thy Lord had by His presence made the Desert) they did flie. 186 JESUS who bow'd from Heav'n poor Man to meet, Could not refrain to entertain the Croud; Whom with impartial respect to greet, As fully as their Tide, his court'sy flow'd: For he kind welcome dealt to great and small, Who came to be the Savior of All. 187 Then as the wise Physician's wholsome care Is first to make the Vitals sound within, Before he lends relief to any sore, Which craves his pity in the open skin: So did his prudent tenderness to those His numerous Patients his Receipts dispose. 188 By long Distempers both their Brain and Heart Into Despair's dominion had been brought, Had they not met with his All-healing Art, From whose sweet Lips such Cordials broke out, Such Salves, such Balsams, that pure Health did seem Turn'd into Physick to recover them. 189 Heav'n's Kingdom was the Med'cine he apply'd; A Med'cine which its Doctor well became: A Med'cine fit to humble down that Pride, Whose tumor made them sick: his Home from home To find his long lost Sheep, to Earth he brings And is resolv'd to heal them into Kings. 190 Meek Kings, that so at length they might be High; For none but such his wondrous Kingdom fits: Since He, the God of all Sublimity, To Lowliness's bottom thus submits, His followers must learn by stooping down, To raise their Heads to their Supernal Crown. 191 Doses of Wisdom, Power, Life and bliss Into their ears he pour'd: and in that stream So rarely He infus'd all Paradise, That what did nothing but a Sermon seem, Was liquid Heav'n: the jewel thus, unseen Swum in the goblet of th'Egyptian Queen. 192 And this advanc'd the wonder, that his tongue No help of learned Education had: The soundest Doctor's brains were not so strong But in his young and feeblest years He made Them to his more oraculous Problems yield The honor of sage Disputation's field. 193 For never did the Ezrahite Ethan, never Did Heman, Chalcol, Darda, whose renown Exalted high above the World did hover, And plant upon their temples Wisdom's crown; Never did Trismegistus; never did The deepest reach of Zoroastre's head; 194 Never did Solomon, whose gallant wit As high's the Heav'n, as deep as was the Sea, Unlock'd and ransack'd every cabinet Of darkest Nature; dive so far as He, Or such sententious Rarities express As sparkled in this rich Discourse of His. 195 Yea ev'n the Serpent, in whose wily head All cunning reigns, when he thy Grandame Eve With his profoundest and most studyed Inchantments try'd, of old, and did deceive, Less sweetly and less subtly preach'd, than now This Sermon from thy Spouse's lips did flow. 196 The Serpent's Preachment aimed Man to steal Into the snare of his own misery: Thy Spouse's end was only to reveal The passage to his own felicity: And Heav'n forbid, but Truth as strong should be As undermining lies and flattery. 197 It stronger was, by full authority Shewing its own authentick worth and might; And not in doubting sneaking jealousy Desirous of, yet starting from the light. The Chair which totters is the Scribe's, not His Which surer than the World's Heart fixed is. 198 Amphion never by his charming Song So civilized salvage hearts as He Who by the sweets of his most potent Tongue Wild Wickedness tam'd into piety. The senseless Spheres a ravishing sound can make; Much more His voice from whom their tune they take. 199 This done; thy tender God his love expresses In outward Succours; for with Ears the Deaf, With feet the Lame, with Eyes the Blind he blesses, And opes more choise of Sovereign Relief Than they of wants. O copious Savior, who At once could heal both Soul and Body too. 200 The Day grown now decrepit (for the Sun Bow'd to the West,) made his Disciples pray Their Lord to give the crowd dismission, That in the Desert's bordering Burroughs they Might get their suppers: No, said bounteous He, They are my friends, and they shall sup with me. 201 Before these numerous Mouths what will you set? Cry'd they, alas! two hundred pence in bread Will not the sorry pittance of a bit To every one afford; and furnished How shall this mighty Banquet be with dishes Since here's but five poor Loaves and two small fishes? 202 As yet they knew not that their Lord was He Who able made the petty spring to feed And fill the Rivers' vast capacity: He who the single Taper taught to breed That fertile flame which lights a thousand more Without diminishing its native store. 203 He by whose power Elijah could command The final Handful of the wasted Meal To grow upon the pious Widdow's hand, From whom no scarceness could her bounty steal, And by a springing harvest more than turn The pined Barrel to a plenteous Barn: 204 He, in obedience to whose might (and though at Elisha's word) the Pot of Oil awaked Into a fount, whose bubling ceased not Till want of Vessels its Abundance slaked; But then grown wisely Thrifty, it represt Its liberal stream, that nothing might be lost. 205 He, whom the same Elisha did foreshew When he before an hundred Convives set That simple Dinner, which in spending grew, And being small at first, at last was great; The Eater's teeth unlocking but the way Unto the Much which in that Little lay. 206 But now they learn'd it: go, said He, and make My Guests by fifty on a row sit down. Which done; in his creating hands he took The fish and bread, and lifting to his own Fair heav'n his eyes, said grace: when lo, his sweet And mighty Blessings swelled in the meat. 207 For as he brake the Bread, each fragment He Made greater than the whole; no crum did fall But rose into a Loaf, as readily As when you cut a Line, whose products all Are Lines as well as it, though you for ever The new emergent Particles dissever. 208 By his Division the fishes too Suddenly spawn'd a wondrous fulgrown fry; Though dead, yet at his touch they started so, That two usurped Multiplicity; No longer Two, but now a shoal, which from The Sea of Love out at his fingers swum. 209 Then his Disciples' service he commands To be officious to this Growing Feast, And distribute into the People's hands The teeming Bread and Fish: strait every Guest Fell to, admiring how that simple Meat Made them forget all Hony to be sweet. 210 The Quails and Manna had been homely fare, Which Heav'n did in the other Desert shower When hungry Israel was a Pilgrim there, Had This been then serv'd up: The Wine's brave power At Cana born, excell'd the Grape's best blood; So did this Feast to day all other Food. 211 A Feast, which though with Pleasure's Complement The ravish'd Convives Tongues it courted; yet Unto the Palates of their Souls it sent More courteous Salutes; whose Taste did fit Their inward Hunger so exactly, that More with their Hearts than Mouths they feeding sate. 212 Satiety at length, not nauseous, But soberly accomplish'd, put a close To this strange Banquet: When thy generous Yet thrifty Lord, injoyns them not to lose His bountie's surplusage, nor scorn the Meat, Because he gave them more than they could eat. 213 Straitway the fragments all collected were, Which fifty hundred feasted Men had left: When lo the total was exceeded far By those remaining parts; the springing Gift Persu'd its rare multiplication stil, And with the Relicts stuff'd twelve baskets full. 214 Know, Psyche, that thy wise Redeemer by This Wonder, to a greater op'd the way; The long-design'd and precious Mystery Of his dear Body; which He meant to lay On every Christian Altar, there to be The endless Feast of Catholick Piety. 215 A Feast which shall increase upon its Guests, And keep intire when millions filled are: A Feast of Miracles, a Feast of Feasts, Not to a Desert ty'd, but every where Dispers'd abroad, yet every where complete, That all the World may freely come and eat. 216 The feasted People were dismissed now, And JESUS steps into that Mount to Pray: Sure 'twas that Bliss along with them might go, Whom from his Love he sent not yet away, That Night might not upon their path incroach, Nor danger's ambushment their footsteps touch. 217 That by this Miracle, which proved to Their very teeth his Power Divine to be; All other fruitless Helps they might forego, And build their trust on his Divinity. His chosen Twelve mean time (for so their Lord Commanded had) were gone before aboard. 218 That Sea, whose looks thou seest all polished With flattering calmness smil'd just so on them When out they launch'd; but dangerous Fraud lay hid Beneath the glass of that alluring stream: Truth needs no smiles; 'tis only Treason's face Which forced is to borrow painted Grace. 219 As when an envious Spirit, who finds no way Safely to vex the Master's Person, makes His more obnoxious family his prey, And at the second hand his vengeance takes: So Satan now, too weak with Christ to fight, On his Disciples vow'd to ease his spight. 220 Deeply he pin'd to see the People fed, And for himself, resolv'd to make a Feast; Yet by the Sea's vast mouth he studied His dainties to devour; and thus at least Part of the Miracle revenge, and though Not for the Loaves, quit for the Fishes grow. 221 His pride advis'd his wrath not to forget What Jurisdiction he had long pretended Over the Airy Realm; and since a fit Occasion here invited his offended And potent Majesty, to this mad fight He muster'd his Aerial subjects' might. 222 For from the Adriatick Main, and from The Baltick Ocean, and the Irish Sea, He summon'd all the stoutest Storms to foam, And here disgorge their utmost treachery: He made each Wind pick quarrels with his brother, And tumbled them in frantick war together. 223 The East was peevish, sharp and grim the North, The West impetuous, black and foul the South: Each puff'd and swell'd, and wildly belched forth Their fury full in one another's mouth: The brused Clouds in floods their sorrows pour'd, And all the weather-beaten Welkin roar'd. 224 The tatter'd Waves against the Shores were flung, But churlishly again they kick'd them back: Which sharp unkindness hideous mourning wrung From their torn mouths: the startled Deeps did quake, And thinking to escape that dismal fray From their profoundest bottoms ran away. 225 Th'amazed Main within herself was lost, Whilst this stern Tempest vehemently broke Quite through her heart, and all her bowels tost About the groaning Air, with hopes to choke The Moon and Stars; which wild confusion Made both the Waters and the Winds be one. 226 And thus the Winds flow'd, and the Waters blew; The Waves' loud fra[n]gor with the Thunder's joyn'd; The Lightning flashed, that misery to shew, In which all direful Dread and Death combin'd; 'Twixt Light and Darkness hence grew such a fight, That now alas 'twas neither Day nor Night. 227 In hurlyburly through the billowy Air A thousand dismal Apparitions flew, Whose bloody glaring eyes with deep Dispair The frighted looks of every Comfort slew. Hell chang'd its fiery Deeps in spightful sport, And in these humid Gulphs kept open Court. 228 The woful Ship flung towards Heav'n in vain Upon the back of an unfaithful Wave, With dreadful mockery strait was plung'd again Into the bottom of its gaping grave; Which gave it there no rest, but spew'd it up With indignation to the Tempest's top. 229 The Mast submitted to the Wind, and split; The Sails forsook the Ship, and flew away; The Helm disdain'd the Pilot's useless wit, Who needed now some wiser hand to stay And steer himself: the Sea made bold to come Aboard, and take a view of every room. 230 Loud laugh'd the Billows at the Pumps, and in Proud flouts defy'd their frustrate power: each blast Bandy'd the Bark, contending which should win The credit of its wrack: thus bang'd and tost In Tennis-courts a Ball thou oft hast view'd, Until some loss the boistrous Game conclude. 231 For their Devotions all themselves apply'd, (For danger wakes the dullest piety,) O where is Jesus now? his Scholars cry'd, How is his Promise wash'd away, since we Whom for Men-fishers He designed had To Fishes now a booty must be made! 232 Yet as their lamentations swell'd, the Tide Of louder Winds and Waves still drown'd their cry. They once for all most gladly would have dy'd, But still they saw Deaths strangely multiply, And throw them and their Ship broken together, From one Destruction's mouth into another. 233 Mean while the Gulph of Satan's boiling breast Wrought with as great a tempest of vexation, To see a crazy Vessel thus resist The Wind's and Sea's most eager conjuration: Puzel'd and gall'd he wonder'd what should make A Bark so often broke, refuse to break. 234 When lo, shot through a Cloud's prodigious crack, Continu'd Lightning smote the dazled Air; By which one marching on the Tempest's back, The staring Men descry'd: and now new fear Stormed their wracked Souls: Alas, they cry'd, By all these Deaths why might we not have dy'd? 235 Here, here the Spirit comes, whose fatal wrath Rais'd this tempestuous preface to our woe: See how he hither bends his hasty path, And o'r the waves securely gallops; lo, Which way soe'r he speaks, but with his hand, The Clouds start back, and reverence his command. 236 Mark how the awed Winds forbear to blow Disturbance in his way by boistrous weather; And all officiously behind him go, Shewing that on his errand they came hither. He comes, he comes! sweet Sea, O gape not thus In vain, but from this danger swallow us. 237 Forthwith their Lord, who heard this desperate cry, Thrust in his Comfort: Add no more, said He, This Tempest to your Storm of misery, Nor rend your Hearts with dread: mistake not Me, I am your loving Lord and Master, and Why fear you Death, now Life's thus near at hand? 238 As He whose trembling neck lies ready under The coming axe, if some unlook'd-for voice Brings his Reprieve, 'twixt troubled joy and wonder He starts, and slowly understands the noise Of promis'd Life, already being dead In's own despairing thoughts, and buried. 239 So these Disciples, drowned in their fears, Now questioned their Eyes' fidelity, Which saw their Lord; nor could they trust their Ears, Although they heard himself profess 'twas He. The sudden influence of unhop'd-for Bliss, Always a deluge of amazement is. 240 But fervid Peter, rousing up his Heart In confidence's Ark, resolv'd to ride Above this Flood: though back the rest did start, He forward prest, and valiantly cry'd, O bid thy ready humble servant meet, If thou our Master art, thy blessed Feet. 241 If thou deceiv'st us not, each surly wave At thy injunction to my steps will bow, And with security my passage pave; If otherwise; Can I be worse than now? The Sea into our Vessel crouds, and I Must either here or there in water die. 242 Come then, his gracious Master cry'd: But as He labour'd forward, lo an high-swoll'n wave Tumbling and foaming in his way, alas, Did all his courage instantly outbrave. His Heart sunk first, and then his Feet, and all But's Tongue, which sadly to his Lord did call. 243 Had any other Lord but He been there, With what indignant scorn would he have made His faithless Subject meet his censure where He more in sin than in the Sea did wade! But now Omnipotence itself exprest Pity to Him, who dar'd its Power distrust. 244 Jesus, whose Ear delights to hear the cry Of suppliants, though Sinners, reach'd his Hand, (That Hand where only dwells Security; That Hand which rules the stubborn Ocean, and Measures it in its Palm,) and snatch'd him out From that deep Sea, and from his deeper Doubt. 245 And then, O thou of little faith, said He, Why did that weak suspition press thee down? What made thee so forget almighty Me Who can in their own Waves all Tempests drown? Learn now, and blush, that Winds and Billows know The Power of their Maker more than Thou. 246 Here having step'd aboard, he turn'd his Eye Upon the Storm, and sternly signified His royal Will: their duty instantly The Winds discover'd in that Glance, and hied Away in such great haste and fear, that they Lost all their Breath and Spirits by the way. 247 The mutinous Billows saw his awful Look, And hush'd themselves all close into their Deep: The Sea grew tame and smooth; the Thunder broke Its threatning off; forth durst no Lightning peep, But kept its black Nest, now outshined by The flashing Mandates of its Master's Eye. 248 The Devils who all this while had toss'd and rent The Elements, perceiv'd the final Wrack Fall on their own Design, and yelling went Home to their Pangs; the Clouds in sunder brake And having clear'd the Scene of these loud Wars, Left Heav'n's free face all full of smiling Stars. 249 Forthwith the Ship without or Sail, or Tide, Kept strait its course, and flew to kiss the shore: Where Jesus deigns to be the Vessel's Guide, Where needs no help of Time, Tide, Wind, or Oar: His Eye alone might drive the Bark, whose Look Abash'd the Sea, the Storm with terror stroke. 250 His Eye, his Eye is that eternal Star Which gildeth both the Poles; which day and night Equally shines; which guides all those who are Sailing in Life's rough Sea: for by his Light And none but his, each mortal Mariner Who goes for Safety's Port, his Course must steer. 251 Mark now that shore of populous Genaser, Where from a Storm He once arriv'd before: Great was the Wonder He atchieved there, Not on tempestuous Winds and Seas, but more Outrageous Fiends, who had themselves possest Of an unhappy Man's usurped breast. 252 Those Tombs shut out of town thou seest there These Devils made his sullen habitation. To damned Spirits such places dearest are As most invite to desolate Desparation. But henceforth Christian Cœmiteries shall Revenge this boldness, and all Hell appal. 253 Which Truth, the Fiend who wears the famous Name Of wise Apollo shall at length confess To his own Julian, in the stinging shame Of forced Silence, when great Babyla's, Intombed Dust shall able be to stop His lying mouth, and seal his Oracle up. 254 Oft drove they to that neighbour Mountain's brow The frantick staring Wight, in hopes that he Out of his tiresome Life himself would throw Into their Pit of deeper Misery. A thousand Snakes about his heart they wound, Whilst Rage and Madness did his brain confound. 255 The froth of which Confusion foamed out At his unquiet mouth: sometimes he roar'd; Sometimes he sung; sometimes his frensy wrought As high as Blasphemy, and freely pour'd A rayling flood on Heav'n and God, whom yet He thought not of in all his raving fit. 256 The Rocks and Tombs he tore with hideous Cries, Which bellow'd fright on every Passenger: Poetick fancy never could devise Such dismal Barking for fierce Scylla, or Fell Cerberus; nor could the Thunder's voice Though louder, make so terrible a Noise. 257 For how should Monsters speak, but like themselves! But for sweet-tuned Man to howle and yell, Doubles the prodigy: nor were those Elves Who make Damnation's Sink with Horrors swell, Such frightful Devils, as they now appear, Had they not once shin'd in th'Angelick sphere. 258 All Men he hated; but Himself much more Than all his other foes, yet knew not why: Alas, 'twas Hell which in his soul did roar, That sworn Maligner of Humanity: Hell, which with all the World maintaineth wars, But chiefly with itself for ever jars. 259 And in his bosom now it boils so hot; That he impatient of all Rayment grew, ('Twas Satan's dearest first-begotten Plot Man's naked shame to lay in open view), His cloaths he rent, and then pluck'd off his hair, And star'd about for something else to tear. 260 The sharpest Stones which in the Rocks he spy'd His cruel love more than all Jewels won; With those his vengeance on himself he tryd, And lin'd it out upon his launced skin. And though they pained him, yet still to spight His Pains, he in his Wounds would take delight. 261 Hast at the stake a roaring Bull beheld, Worry'd by ten keen Mastiffs, and in gore And gashes cloth'd? that Spectacle must yield To his bemangled shape of horror; for Not all the Dogs of Albion can tear A Bull, as he himself had baited here. 262 His tatter'd brows hung down below his eyes; His mouth and nose met in one rent; his head Was slash'd; the bones star'd in his plowed thighs, His sides were gash'd; his arms and bosom flead; His wounds concurr'd, and drowned one another Like Rivers blended in the Sea together. 263 And wonder not that all this tedious while His vital Powers could be so hardy as Pain's tide to stem, and be confederate still With his tormented Heart: the Fiends could pass No further than their Chain, which though it reach'd His Body, could not to his Life be stretch'd. 264 (So when their King commission had to try The valour of the Idumean Prince Against a siege of Boils, and Battery Of thousand wounds Job's Life made brave defence; And spight of any Mines, maintain'd his Breath's Strong Arsenal against an host of Deaths.) 265 This added to their everboiling spight New raging fire, by which they stung his wrath, To wreak itself on every mortal Wight, Whose hard hap damn'd them to his headlong path. Thus all about the coast this terror spread, And cares, and fears, and plots awakened. 266 As when a Lyon from the Forest broke, Invades some Shepherd's pasture, every Town Which borders on that sad mischance, doth look Upon their neighbor's danger as their own, And all their country arms, and dogs unite Against the publick foe in common fight: 267 Th'alarmed Gaderens so combin'd their strength, The fury of this raving Man to tame: In vain a while they grapled, till at length By number not by power they overcame; And loading him with chains and fetters, hop'd They now had his mischievious torrent stop'd. 268 But he with ireful smiles disdain'd their plot, And rending off his idle fetters, threw Them at their scorned heads: No bands they got, Their oft-defeated project to renew, Whether of steel or brass, but served Him For engins, which he tore, and flung at them. 269 Triumphant thus in fierceness, he espied Thy Lord upon that shore, and to him ran: But never with more hideous bellowing cry'd, Nor madlier beat or cut himself, than when Near Jesus he approached, from whose look Both pity now, and indignation broke. 270 His bowels yearn'd, his anger flam'd, to see Hell domineering in that tortured Breast Of which his Sovereign Self, and Heav'n should be By their eternal right alone possest. This made Him by that Power which chas'd away Of late that other Tempest, this allay. 271 Foul Fiend, he cry'd, usurp that Hold no more; The Man is mine, and I his Lord will be. Come forth, thou bold Intruder, and restore Thy prize again, both to himself and Me. O mighty Voice! which rent the Devil more Then he had done the woful Man before. 272 For as the Slave, who broken is by stealth Into his Master's closet, revels there Among the Bags of ready-coined wealth, And any Bills or Bonds presumes to tear, Making all fuel for his peevish rage, And thus revenging his own Vassalage; 273 But if his Master's unexpected Eye Happens to apprehend him in his sin; That glance, like lightning's dint, so piercingly Afflicts his thievish guilty Soul, that in Base-hearted thankless meekness down he falls, And on his wretched face for pardon calls: 274 So did the Fiend: in one huge gust of horror Were all the World's deep dying groans united, They could not tear the Skies with so much terror, As did his Ejulation; which affrighted, And forc'd the mourning Tombs, and Rocks and Sea In its impatient Echo to agree. 275 Jesus, thou highest Son of God most high, Am I a match, an equal Match for Thee? If I must yield my Fort, and naked lie, Whilst Thou triumph'st and tramplest upon me; Yet by thy Father's Name I thee conjure, Thou damn me not new torments to endure. 276 But since the Lord had stretch'd him on the rack, He charg'd the Traitor to confess his Name: O how this Mandate did his Heart-strings crack, Which snatch'd the vail from off his ugliest shame; And for one Serpent which the World supposed There to have lurk'd, a Legion disclosed. 277 No other Name he durst acknowledge now But Legion; for so indeed they were. Vile Cowards, what is Dust and Clay, that you So numerous an Army mustered there? Fine credit 'tis for troops of Spirits to lay Their ambush one poor mortal Man to slay. 278 But O, that Men, whose mystick obligation Of mutual Membership doth them invite To careful tenderness, and free compassion; With such confederate zeal, and stout delight Would help their Brethren up the heav'nly Hill, As these contrive to plunge them deep in Hell! 279 There hadst thou been, my Dear, thou might'st have seen In what a fearful lamentable guise These Devils to their prayers fell, to win Some pity from thy Lord's imperious Eyes: Which did the baseness of their Spirit prove, Who stoop'd to fawn on whom they scorn to love. 280 Him they beseech'd to let them harbor still In this cool Region, and not force them home. They knew they should too hot have found their Hell, If they had back without their Errand come; That disappointed Satan on their head Would all his boiling wrath have emptiéd. 281 Besides; their proper Diocess was this Nor might their jurisdiction further go: For Satan here cants out his Provinces, And all his Deputies disposeth so That no Commission jarreth with another, Nor any Fiend incroacheth on his brother. 282 And this he do's in insolent emulation Of that fair Polity by Heav'n erected, Whereby each Empire, Kingdom, Country, Nation, By some Angelic Patron is protected, Guided, and governed; as every Man By his particular vigilant Guardian. 283 What would'st thou have us do, they cry'd; Can we Made all of active metal, idle sit? Are we not Devils? how can Devils be For any thing but rage and fury fit? Mischief's our proper diet; why wilt thou Who all things feed'st, not Us our food allow? 284 If we must be, we must be what we are; Infernal Spirits can no change admit: For sure our venturous though unfortunate War Against thy self, thou never wilt forget; Nor repossess Us of our calmy state So that we now are Furious by Fate. 285 Besides; we Subjects are (and thine own hand Buckled this yoke on our rebellious necks,) To that impatient Prince, whose dire Command Back'd with Hell's universal Terrors, pricks Us on to Rage; and we do nothing now, But what in duty to our Lord we ow. 286 Had we without Commission hither flown, And garrison'd this Man's strong-builded breast, The fault, whate'r it is, had been our own: But since by Order we this Hold possest, Our General must in equity, not We Poor common Soldiers, answer it to Thee. 287 As then Thou art a generous Conqueror, Give reasonable Quarter to thy Foes: Since needs we must surrender, e'r we stir, Ingage thy promise, that we shall not loose Our natural Properties; some power leave us (For 'tis no crime in us,) to be Mischievous. 288 An Herd of Swine there feeds on yonder Mount, (And that's it Psyche,) Beasts so filthy that They seem'd unworthy in thine own account, And justly too, to be thy Servants' meat. Yet what to Jews thou mad'st impure, shall be Dainties to Us, if thou wilt leave us free. 289 Free, our own swindge to take, and domineer In those despised reprobated Things. If ever Devils did to Thee prefer A sute more fair, more humble, may our wings And Snakes be clip'd, our Tallons prun'd, our stout Horns lopped off, our iron Teeth dash'd out. 290 The Furies pleaded so; and with an eye Where fear insulted over jealous Hope; Beheld their Judge: He knew the reason why They begg'd that ugly boon; he knew their scope Was, that the Swine to Man might seem a Creature Curs'd and abandon'd by the God of Nature. 291 Yet He was pleased, (whither to avenge The Owner's Avarice, or for some deep cause Known to his wisest Self,) to let these strange Dwellers upon those brutish Mansions seize: For He to whom the whole World's Rights belong, Can all things do, and yet can do no Wrong. 292 As when in pregnant Etna's labouring womb The smoaking flaming and sulphureous Child Is to its horrible matureness come; The moved bowels of the Mount are fill'd With pangs and throws, till by a roaring birth The stinking Prodigy is broken forth: 293 With such tormenting Travel felt this Man His entrails torn whilst Hell was bursting thence; Rank Hell, which with more baneful vapors than The worst of fuming brimstone choak'd his sense: And surely he had by that Stink and Pain, Had Life not looked on, been double slain. 294 But ne'r did Air put on so calm a face, When every Wind to its own home was blown, And Heav'n of all its storms deliver'd; as Redeemed He, now once again His own: Finding the Furies which his heart did swell, Had left Himself within Himself to dwell. 295 As startled from some black and frightful Dream, His safetie's count'nance he with wonder saw: In sober rayment strait he hides his shame, Or rather Theirs whose treason made him throw It off before, and cloth his body round In one unnatural universal wound. 296 No frantick fumes now reaked in his head; Clear as the upper Region was his brain, And with his heart distinctly trafficked; Whose trade his Intellect maintain'd again Whilst his late-cheating fancy thrusts no more Adulterate Wares upon him, as before. 297 His furious Passions bowing to the yoke Of temperate Reason, tamely grew serene: His Will her mighty throne more wisely took, And reigned like a stout but warey Queen. His Thought's Pulse in his Soul beat gently, and Taught him his Bliss and Self to understand. 298 He understood to whom his Thanks were due, To whom his rescu'd heart, his life, his peace; To his sweet task of Gratitude he flew In holy haste, but flew upon his knees: And then at his divine Redeemer's feet, As his meek Scholar, begg'd, and took his seat. 299 Mean while the Devils to the Mountain made Upon the wings of fury and disdain: For though they scorn'd the Swine; yet since they had No better prey, their spight could not refrain. The feeding Herd strait felt their bellies swell With unknown stuffing, being stretch'd with Hell. 300 As at the Orgies, when the Priests are drown'd In their mad God, they grow as wild as He; They stare, they roar, they rave, they tumble round, And only in confounded strife agree: So here the swine brake into raging revels, Being drunk with this full Legion of Devils. 301 They grunt, they whine, they squeak, they foam, they leap, They stumble, fall, and rise, and fall again; Their tusks in one another's blood they steep, But oftnest in their own: the Dogs in vain Did bark, in vain the swineherds cry and swear, The Herd no Clamor but their own could hear. 302 At length in one mad hurry to that Brow By which into the Sea the Mountain peeps, They headlong run, and one another throw In loud tumultuous throngs into the Deeps. And thus those Devils drown'd their wretched Prey, Their own long thirst of Mischief to allay. 303 Observe that other shore: thy Spouse's fame Shin'd with no less illustrious Glory there: Witness Her faith who from Phenicia came Wisely to take miraculous Physick here. She long had her Phenician Doctors try'd, Who not her Blood's but Purse's Issue dry'd. 304 But here she found a strange Physitian, whose Sole Physick is his sovereign self, and who Gratis on all his heav'nly Art bestows: Yet her unclean Disease's shame did so Confute its Pain, that rather than reveal Her Sickness, she resolves its Cure to steal. 305 (O gratious Modesty, how potent are Thy tender Laws, which, though despised by Bold self-applauding souls, alone outdare The saucy Armies of Impiety; And Keep in Safety's garrison from peril All those who war in Virtue's noble Quarrel!) 306 Her meekly-faithful heart had caught fast hold On Jesu's garment's verge: and O, cry'd she, Could but my fingers do as much, I would Not doubt to catch my safe Recovery. Which said, the pious Thief took heart, and stept Into the Crowd, and there behind Him crept. 307 Then her most trembling most undoubting Hand Upon His lowest Hem she gently stay'd; Which with a tripple Kiss she reverenc'd, and Her meek soul on that humble Altar lay'd: But whilst her blushing Blood flush'd in her face, She felt its other Current dryed was. 308 For as on Aaron's consecrated head The holy Unguent would not bridled be, But down his beard its precious influence shed And fully reach'd his robe's extremity: So did the Virtue of this higher Priest His utmost Clothes with mystick Power invest. 309 But Jesus, who could not permit that such Heroick Faith it self should smother up; Inquires what Hand his vesture's skirt did touch, And set the Issue of his Virtue ope; That Virtue's mighty Issue which alone Could wash away this Woman's bloody one. 310 She hearing this, and guilty of the high And faithful Theft, fell trembling at his feet, Confessing all her blessed Crime, and why So timorously her Boldness acted it: But while she fear'd her Saviour's anger, He Applauds the fact, and bids her cheerly be. 311 Daughter, he cries (for those his Children are Whose holy Confidence on Him relies,) Henceforth for ever banish needless fear; Thy valiant Faith secures and fortifies Thy re-obtained Health: go home, and be Assur'd my Peace shall sojourn there with thee. 312 Her zealous Thanks she pay'd, and homeward went; But His dear Image in her heart she bore. Resolv'd to fix it in a Monument Of lasting Gratitude; which at her door She reared up, and made Cesarea far More nobly beauteous than it was aware. 313 Erected there in bright substantial Brass Thy Spouse's statue shines; and so shall stand Till Julian with a more obdurate face And heart, than is that Metal, shall command The reverend Effigies to come down And yield its stately Basis to his own. 314 His own; which when on heav'n it 'gins to stare, Shall learn what Vengeance dwells in Jesu's hand; From whence a speedy bolt of fire shall tear The proud and sacrilegious Idol; and Warn its bold Owner timely to forbear Affronting thus the pacient Thunderer. 315 But yonder, Psyche, holy Tabor is, A Mount enobled by a brighter Story. The Temple's Hill bow'd down its head to this, And vail'd its Legal to the Gospel Glory. To this, the Mount, where Satan's Pageant op'd The Universe's pompous Beauties, stoop'd. 316 Thither thy Lord once pleased to withdraw, With three Attendants, Peter, James, and John, Leaving the rest, and all the World below; That in Devotion's proper region His soul might move; since his design was now To pray himself, and teach his Consorts how. 317 To be retired from tumultuous things, And sequestred from heavy clogging Earth, Two trusty Ladders are which Wisdom brings To help true Prayers climb; two Ladders worth All Climaxes which ever yet were set Up by the loftiest strains of eloquent wit. 318 He pray'd: and with such noble ardency That through his eyes his flaming Spirit broke, And stoutly flash'd to Heav'n: no Piety In such a splendid chariot ever took Its blessed journy to the throne of God, Nor in such humbly-royal triumph rode. 319 Day's wonted Monarch dazell'd at the sight Admir'd what other Sun from earth did rise; With whose victorious Looks too weak to fight, He some new ev'n sought for his vanquish'd eyes. And well the Day could spare his garish beams Being gilded by his Maker's purer flames. 320 For He who in his Bodie's vail till now The Rays of his Divinity had hid, Released them into free leave to flow And roul about him in a glistering tide. Thus when his Key unlocks the clouds, from thence The lightning pours its radiant Influence. 321 But as that inexhausted fount of light Which bubbles up in Titan's limpid eyes, Sheds over all his royal robes its bright Effusions, and his Charet glorifies, So that about Heav'n's Circuit He is roll'd Enthron'd and cloath'd in living sparkling Gold. 322 So from thy Spouse's more than sunlike face The Lustre all about his Rayment darted: A Lustre whose divine and gentle grace It self with kind magnificence imparted To that weak mortal Texture, which so pure Immortal brightness else could not endure. 323 Thus when a dainty fume in Summer air To lambent fire by nature's sporting turns, And lightly rides on Men's Attire or Hair; With harmless flames it plays, and never burns Its habitation, but feeds upon The Delicates of its own Beams alone. 324 As his Disciples wonder'd at the Sight Which peeping through their fingers they beheld, They spy'd two Strangers, whom with courteous light The surplusage of Jesus's Beams did gild. They wistly looked on them, musing who The Men might be, and what they came to do. 325 The first ware horned beams (though something dim In this more radiant Presence,) on his face; Full was his beard; his countenance 'twixt grim And pleasant, breathing meek but stately Grace: His robes were large and princely; in his hand He held a mystick and Imperious wand. 326 A golden Plate both deck'd and arm'd his breast, In which the Ten great Words inammel'd were; A grave a goodly Man he was, and drest In such attire, that they no longer are In doubt about him, but conclude that He Moses the Legislator needs must be. 327 The other, sagely solemn in his look, But course and homespun in his garb appear'd; Nor had he any mantle's help to cloke That vileness which in his poor rayment star'd; The serious beams which darted from his eye, Spake eremitical severity. 328 Two Ravens, whose plumes taught blackness how to shine, Upon his venerable shoulders sate: And ravenous now no more, did freely join Their services in purveying for his meat; For in their faithful beaks they ready had The one a piece of flesh, the other bread. 329 Behind him stood a flaming Chariot, With steeds all of the same fierce Element; Nor was their fire more than their Courage hot, And much ado they had to stand content. Which Tokens having well observ'd, they knew Those Indications must Elias shew. 330 These two grand Prophets, whom thy Lord gave leave To wear some glorious beams, though He were by, Their reverend Discourses interwove Of his Humanitie's Oeconomy; With high ecstatick Words displaying how At Salem He Death's Power should overthrow. 331 A Doctrine which on his Disciples' ear (And this their Master knew,) full hard would grate; And therefore by these glorious Preachers here With high solemnity was witness'd, that His Crosse's and his Nails' mysterious shame Might not with scandal shake, forewarned Them. 332 His Rod then Moses at his feet laid down, In token that He had fulfill'd his Law; And came to give a nobler of his own, To which not only Jacob's Seed should bow, But all the World, whose largest furthest bound With Jesus and his Gospel was to sound. 333 That done; a vail he drew upon his face, And cry'd, Bright Lord, this shade I us'd of old Because my Count'nance too illustrious was For those blear Eyes of Israel to behold: But now mine own have need of it, to skreen Them from that splendor's dint which shoots from thine. 334 This though refracted Vision's fuller Bliss Than I of old beheld from Nebo's head; How happily was I (reserv'd for this Far fairer Privilege,) not suffered To enter then, and feed my Wonder on The less amazing sweets of Canaan! 335 But in a generous meek Expostulation Elias argu'd with his glorious Lord: And, Why, said he, in such triumphant fashion Me didst Thou whirle to heav'n, and not afford Thy servant leave to taste Death's bitter Cup, Since Thou thy self resolv'st to drink it up! 336 Must Jesus, and must not Elias die? Must God, and not a Worm? forbid it Thou Who of all Order art the Deity, And Death to my Mortality allow: I 'l be contented with the last to stay, Ev'n till Time dies, if then I allso may. 337 O pardon my Ambition to die, Since, dearest Lord, it is for Thee alone: If for thy Name, and in thy Quarrel I The Robes of Martyrdom may once put on, My passage up to heav'n shall brighter be Than when my flaming Coach transported Me. 338 Ask me not what Reply great Jesus gave To these Devotos, since nor James, nor John, Nor Peter ever had their Master's leave To ope this Secret to the World. But on Their heads, when they had their due season staid, He his dismissing Hand and Blessing laid. 339 Then having by a tripple Kiss ador'd His sacred foot: into his Chariot Elias leap'd, and through the Welkin scour'd As swift as Arrow by the Tartar shot: And Moses, spreading out his ready Vail, Homeward to Abraham's blessed Port set sail. 340 When lo a Cloud came rolling on and stretch'd Its shady curtains o'r the Mountain's top: A precious Cloud, with God's own voice inrich'd; For as it brake, no other Rain did drop But these dear Words, My Darling Son is This, Hear Him, in whom my Joy triumphant is. 341 The faint Disciples on their faces fell, Amaz'd that Thunder could distinctly speak: Mean while their Lord was pleased to recall And charge his Glory's Beams to hasten back: His Godhead needed now no more probation, That Glimpse being doubled by Heav'n's Attestation. 342 Forthwith his Raies shrunk home into his breast, And moderate Beauty repossess'd his face: The orient Lustre which his Cloths had drest To their plain native hue resign'd its place; And He return'd to his Capacity Of, what he long'd for, shame and Misery. 343 But turn thee now to Salemward, and see New Monuments of both his Power and Love. That Hill is Sion, and that Pool where he Wets his large foot, is Siloam; above Its bottom lies, for in the Mountain's breast Its Springs of Living Silver make their Nest. 344 Springs sober and discreet; which brake not forth By wanton Chance, but upon Bus'ness flow'd. Right noble is the Story; and its Worth Beyond the knowledge of th'illiterate Crowd: But I, dear Psyche, will unlock to thee The bowels of this ancient Mystery. 345 When Virtue's Sovereign, Hezekias sate On Judah's throne, th'Assyrian Power swell'd high, And turned sinful Israel's florid state Into the worst of Woes, Captivity: For Assur then was made the iron Rod Which Vengeance put into the hand of God. 346 That first Success so puff'd the Rod with Pride, That it forgot the Hand which sway'd it then: And now would needs it self become a guide Unto it self, and choose its Prey: but in Its proudest height the Rod's rash plot was crost, And near two hundred thousand Twiggs it lost. 347 Whilst Rabsheka, the Foulmouth'd General, With Horse, and Men, and Brags, and Blasphemies Beleaguer'd Salem, on the suddain all Their stock of Water fail'd; but that which Eyes Sad Eyes distill'd, and which but filled up Their vast Affliction's lamentable Cup. 348 And now compassionate Esay, mov'd to try What credit he with Heav'n and Mercy had, Tuned his Prayer by the People's Cry; Which with such violence beat the ear of God, That strongly bounding back to Sion's foot, And his own knees, it made the Spring leap out. 349 The thirsty People all came flocking in, Their Mouths, their Bottles, and their Souls, to fill. Th'Assyrians wonder'd what those Crowds might mean, Until they spy'd their buis'ness at the Well; And then they made a Party out, to stop The newborn Spring, or else to drink it up. 350 Forthwith the Citizens themselves betook To flight; so did the Fount, and shrunk its head Into the Hill, and called back its Brook, Commanding every Drop to go to bed, And not to prostitute themselves, and be Deflour'd by Assur's lips' impurity. 351 The Streams obey'd, and swifter than the speed Of those impatient Horsmen, homeward ran. So when the prudent Dame has summoned Her crawling frie to shun th'incursion Of Violence, the nimble Serpents shoot Themselves into their Mother's ready throat. 352 The disappointed Soldiers rav'd and swore, To see the Fountain mock and scorn their Might; And cry'd, these Jews have by some magick power Broached this wiley Spring from Hell, to spight Sennacherib's Legions, and shew that We Cannot so strong as wretched Water be. 353 Thus they retreated in disdain and wrath: When strait their Thirst the Jews brought back again, The Spring as soon found out its former path, And courteously met them on the Plain; Kissing their feet, and smiling in their face, For whose sole service He so watchful was. 354 Thus checkering his work, he never fails To fail his foes, and to befriend his friends. Full often Assur tries, but ne'r prevails, To catch the wary nimble stream, which sends Him always empty back; and waited still With fresh supplies on thirsty Israel. 355 The fam'd Sabbatick Fount which all the week Keeps close at home, and lets no drop spurt out, Exactly thus attends the Seventh Day's Break; At whose first peeping Dawn, as quick as Thought It pours its flood, and sacrifices all Its Plenty to that holy Festival. 356 A Man there was, whom from her secret Shop Dark and retired Nature sent abroad Into the World, yet from him shut it up, And him in's proper home an Exile made. Compar'd with him, clear-sighted was the Owl, So was the evening Bat, and earthed Moul. 357 For on his brow sate an anneiled Night Which his Birth-day could not confute; in vain His Mother hir'd the sage Physitian's Might To war against that Shadow, and constrain That inbred sturdy Blackness to relent; In vain her money and her love she spent. 358 Less thick that Darkness was which did revenge The lustful Glances of wild Sodom's eyes; When those hot Lovers damped by a strange Invasion of pitch, with oaths and cries Tumbled and toss'd themselves from place to place, And sought Lot's Door in one another's face. 359 As Jesus spy'd this helpless Wight, (for He Watch'd to surprise all Objects of Compassion,) Speeded by his own heav'nly Charity, To his relief he flies. This generous fashion Love duly follows, and ne'r stays to be Woo'd and importun'd to a Courtesy. 360 The groping Man perceiving one draw nigh, Fell to the Beggar's covetous Dialect; He Money, Money crav'd: but that's not my Largise, thy Lord reply'd, which doth infect Those who admire it; surely thou wouldst find What Bane thou begg'st, wert thou not double Blind. 361 Alas thou beggest that, which should I grant Would make thee poorer than thou wert before, Thou begg'st such Wealth as would but gain thee want Of that cheap Rest thou now injoyest; for Money is that bewitching thoughtful Curse Which keeps the heart close Pris'ner in the Purse. 362 Money's that most mischievous Dust which flies Full in the face of undiscerning Man, Not suff'ring his abus'd and damned Eyes To see the way to Heav'n; if thou didst scan Thy state aright, thou mightst thy Blindness bless Who seest not what this monstrous Money is. 363 A thinner Clay than that I 'll temper, which Shall far exceed the worth of Gold to thee: They are not Money's beams which can inrich With pure and lasting wealth; from none but Me Flow forth those efficacious genuine Rays, Which bless the Age with sweet and golden Days. 364 This said, three times he spit upon the ground, And moulded with his hand a sovereign Clay: No salve by deepest Art was ever found, Which could so sure all Maladies allay: Should Balsam's self fall sick and die, the power Of this sole Unguent would its life restore. 365 This on his Patient's Eyes he spred; and yet Although he cur'd them, gave them not their sight: First an Experiment he meant to get Whether his inner Eyes of Faith were bright; Then, with his Favor to reward and grace The Pool, which long before so pious was. 366 Bethesda Waters swell'd with full-tide fame; Wherefore though apt occasion him invited, Time was when he refus'd to honour them: But fail he would not, to respect these sleighted, Though worthy Streams, which as his partners He In this miraculous work vouchsaf'd to be. 367 To Siloam go, said he, and wash thine Eyes, And thou shalt see what I to thee have given; With holy Confidence strait thither hies The joyful Man; no Hart was ever driven By scalding thirst more greedily to cool Refreshing Brook, than he to find this Pool. 368 He went to drink, not with his Mouth, but Eyes; Which as he wash'd, behold he washed ope: Out flew black Night, with all those dusky ties By which his sense before was chained up; And his released sparkling Pupils show'd Like sprightful Lightning from the broken Cloud. 369 He now both lives, and seeth that he lives, And Heav'n and Earth more than by hear-say knows. No part of all the Universe but gives Him a remembrance, unto whom he ows His power of viewing it. O happy he Who must in every thing his Savior see! 370 Since from the Darknes of the first Abyss, The groveling World was wakened into Light; Ne'r was atchiev'd so strange a Cure as this, Which on condemned Eyes bestowéd Sight, In spight of Nature, who had put them out Before she gave them leave to look about. 371 Mark Psyche, now that love-renowned Town, Great Salem's little Neighbour Bethany: A Place of dear Remembrance, and well known To thy great Lord: from Salem's tumults He Would oft withdraw into that calm retreat, And still as oft's he came he Welcome met. 372 For there two Sisters dwelt, an holy Pair Who with all hospitably-pious love To entertain this Guest ambitious were; And by their most obsequious service strove To let Him know They did no Owner deem Of what they had or were, but only Him. 373 Industrious Martha; unto whom although This World were something still, (in which she drove Her practick trade of life,) yet well she knew 'Twas less than nothing unto that above; The Cream of her Solicitude she spent To purchase more than secular Content. 374 Pathetick Mary; one whom Mercy made Her chosen triumph: this was lustful She Who in the hottest troop of Sinners had A leading Place; such stout Impiety Incouraged her heart, that Hell could put Her on no Task but she would dare to do't. 375 For seav'n soul Devils had themselves possest Of all her Soul, and with imperious port High in th'usurped palace of her breast Their throne erected and maintain'd their court; And all the Warrants which they issued thence She still obey'd with desperate diligence. 376 But Jesus, who his Pity squared by No Merit he in mortal Man could read, But for his Rule took their Capacity Of Succour; found how much this Heart did need His potent Help; which he forthwith apply'd And made her Live who now Seav'n times had dy'd. 377 For from the bottom of her pois'ned breast Seav'n hideous deadly Sins she vomited; And thus from Hell's oppression releast High toward Heav'n she rais'd her zealous head; Flaming with purest fire of Love, as she Before had smoak'd in Lust's impurity. 378 Her brave Devotion she measured now By that large Size of Mercy she had gain'd For as no bounds that noble Mercy knew, So to Infinitude her Love she strain'd; She strained hard, and would the top have reach'd Could mortal Passion to that pitch have stretch'd. 379 O Psyche, hadst thou present been when she On Love's dear errand to her Master came, Thou mightst have seen impatient Piety Mount in the boldness of its generous flame: First at his feet it 'gan, and then it spread With fair and liberal fulness to his head. 380 That fragrant Ointment which before she us'd To her libidinous Skin to sacrifice; Upon his sweeter Feet, she now diffus'd, Adding a shower from her own melting Eyes. Then wiping them with her late crisped Tresses, She offer'd there her consecrated Kisses. 381 She minds not how spectators censure her; Love's careless, and secure, and scorns the mean: She vows e'r from her Lover's Feet she stir, To oint, or wipe, or weep, or kiss them clean; And by this amorous zeal she sanctifies Her Locks, her Lips, her Ointment and her Eyes. 382 But as the sprightful flame disdains to be Confin'd below, and with undaunted pains Up to its lofty sphere contends: So she To her right gallant Passion gave the reins, And at Heav'n's highest Crest took aim; for this I'm sure, said she, the Head of Jesus is. 383 A Box of Nard she had of mighty price, Yet not so precious as her peerless Lord: Could Earth's whole wealth meet in one sacrifice, All this, and more she would to Him afford: And now unbridled Love such haste did make, That strait the Box, or her own Heart must break. 384 Indeed both brake; and both she pour'd on His Head, who is of Sweets and Hearts the King. Forthwith through Heav'n and Earth the Odors run, Which shall for ever with their Praises ring: For now 't has lost its Alabaster Cell, The famous Nard in all the World doth dwell. 385 And wheresoe'r Heav'n-breathing Trumpets sound The Gospel's sweet Alarms, the living Glory Of this Exploit shall certainly rebound Through every holy Ear: in his own Story Her Lord embroider'd her's; and there we see None canoniz'd a Saint by Him but She. 386 Ill-reck'ning Thrift much grumbled at the Cost, Which many needy Mouths might well have fed; As if the Members had the largise lost, Which here bestowed was upon their Head; Or any thing had been too much to give To Him from whom we every thing receive. 387 But Nobleness's Lord, and Mary's, who Thus in his Love to her excessive was, Vouchsafed her generous Soul free leave to go The same most princely and licentious pace: He knows the heat of this unweildy Passion, And will allow it brave Immoderation. 388 The Law of Bounds all other eas'ly bear, Finding their objects are in limits ty'd; But Love alone with infinite career Still further everlastingly doth ride. Because let loose at God himself, in whom Immensity affords her boundless room. 389 Thy easy judgment now computes how dear Was this Seraphick Woman to thy Lord; Well might her only Brother be, for her Sweet sake, to His love's tenderness prefer'd: Who falling sick, she sent her sole Physitian The doleful News, join'd with her meek Petition. 390 He, who had never yet his Help delay'd When Need made Mary his Compassion wooe, Till Phebus twice the World had compass'd, stay'd; He stay'd indeed, but 'twas that he might go With advantageous glory; and his stay Might prove but ripened Love, and not Delay. 391 Mean while his Weakness grew so strong upon Good Lazarus, that his Soul it chased out: Jesus, whose eyes through all things clearly ran, Shin'd on it as it went, and saw it brought On Angels' wings into the blessed Nest Of naked Peace and Quiet, Abraham's breast. 392 Where when it gently was repos'd; our Friend, Our Lazarus, is fall'n asleep, said He, But from that Fall to raise him I intend; Come therefore, let's away for Bethany. And Lord what needs it; if he sleep, what harm Cry'd his Disciples, can our friend alarm! 393 None can, their Lord reply'd, for now he lies Safe in the bosom of Serenity; Yet what his Rest is, little you surmise, Loth to believe true Sleep in Death can be. Alas, the Grave's the only quiet Bed In which securely Rest can lay her head. 394 Death, Death's the soundest Sleep, which makes amends For all this weary World's tempestuous Cares, And pious Souls into that Harbour sends Where never Dangers ride, nor Griefs, nor Fears. Our friend is dead: and glad I am that I Was not at hand to stop his Destiny. 395 Glad for your sakes, whose Faith now dead, shall by His Death revive. This said, he forward went, Yet reach'd not his designed Bethany Till two days more their Sun-bred lives had spent. He could have taken on the Wind's fleet back His coach, but that his plot was to be slack. 396 Yet busy Martha met him, as he drew Near to the Town, (for her solicitous ear Soon caught the fame of his approach, which flew Fairly before with full-mouth'd warning,) where She threw her self upon her knees, and cry'd, Hadst Thou been here, my Brother had not dy'd. 397 Dear Lord of Life, hadst mighty Thou been here, Death would have his due distance kept, if not For love of Thee, or Us, at least for fear Of his own Life. And yet thy Power is but Deferr'd; for well I know thy God will still Each syllable of thy Requests fulfil. 398 Nor weep, nor doubt, sweet Martha, Jesus cry'd, Thy Brother shall again to life return. I doubt not, blessed Master, she reply'd, But in the ruin'd World's repairing Morn When all things live and spring afresh, that He Shall with his Body reinvested be. 399 And why not now? from Me alone, said He, Springs that great Spring: the Resurrection, and The Life thou thinkst far off, talks now with thee. Nor lies there any Pris'ner in the land Of Death, but if in Me he fixt his trust, Shall into life leap from his mortal Dust. 400 Nay He who lives by steady Faith in Me His Life eternally secur'd shall find, And never taste that Death's deep Agony Which never dies. Say Martha, can thy mind Digest this Flesh-amazing Problem, and By meek believing learn to understand? 401 Here dazell'd by his high Discourse, great Lord She cry'd, my Faith adores Thee for no less Than God's Almighty Son, who in his Word Wert promised, this cursed World to bless. This said; on joyous Sorrow's wings she flew And into Mary's ear the Tidings threw. 402 As when the powerful Loadstone's placed near, Th'inamored Iron leaps its Love to kiss: So Mary, hearing that her Lord was there, Posted to meet her dearest Happiness; And falling at her highest throne, his feet, Did Martha's sad Complaint again repeat. 403 Short were her Words, but large her Tears and full, (Love-ravish'd Pleader's strongest Eloquence,) For in each Eye there dwelt a fertile well, Which by its ever-ready influence Confirm'd her Queen of Weepers: ne'r was seen A more bedewed thing then Magdelen. 404 For Love, though valiant as the Lion's heart, Is yet as soft as mildest Turtles' Souls; And mourns as deeply; since no other art Knows how to slake the mighty flame which rouls About her bosom, and would burn her up Did not her streams of Tears that Torrent stop. 405 If when the Clouds lament, the hardest Stone Under their frequent Tears relenteth: how Will Mary's thicker showers prevail upon The Heart of softest Softness! Jesus now Could not but melt and yearn, and gently by His Groans his deep Compassion testify. 406 Which Groans when they broke into a Demand Where Lazarus was inter'd; both Sisters by Turning their lamentable faces, and Their fainting hands, made Sadnesses Reply. At last their Tongues gat strength to cry: O come, See our Grief's Monument, and our Brother's Tomb. 407 He thither stepping, deign'd to broach his Eyes, And vie with Mary's Currents: whether in Pity of Man, whose fatal Miseries From none but his unhappy self began; (For neither God's nor Nature's hand, but He Digg'd his own grave by mad Impiety;) 408 Or in kind grief his dearest friends to see Distrustful still of his Omnipotence; Or meerly in complying Sympathy With their most piteous Tears' exuberance: Whate'r his reason were, He showred down Those streams for Man's sole sake, not for his own. 409 O Tears! how precious are your beads, since He Who is the Gem of heav'n hath brought you forth! Now you may worthy of God's bottles be, Who from God's radiant Eyes derive your Worth: All holy Drops which are of kin to you, By that Affinity must glorious grow. 410 Let flinty Bosoms build their foolish Pride On their own Hardness, and the Weeping Eye As childish and effeminate deride, And too too soft to suit the Bravery Of masculine Spirits: yet truly-noble Hearts With Jesus will not scorn to Weep their parts. 411 But from the Tomb He now commands the Stone Which there had sealed Lazarus's Body up: When lo an harder Marble falling on Poor Martha's heart, her Faith began to stop; Corrupted was her Mind, which made her think And talk so much of four Days, and the stink. 412 What's four poor Days, that their weak intervention Should able be to raise a scruple here, And intercept His sovereign Intention To whom Eternity submits? A year, An Age, a World, can be no stop to Him On whose sole Will depends the life of Time. 413 Stinks and Corruptions no Retardments are To His productive Power, who derives Through Putrifaction's pipes, and kindles there The life his Love to all his Creatures gives. For by his Law, which brooks no Violation, Corruption Mother is to Generation. 414 The stone removed, and their Cave laid ope, Jesus, of Life and Death the mighty King, With awful Majesty first lifted up His hand, and then his Voice, whose thunder rung In these sublime imperious Words, which Earth And Heav'n obeyed, Lazarus come forth. 415 Imperious Words indeed; which reach'd and rous'd The Soul imbosomed in Abraham's Bay; From whence as in exultant haste it loos'd, The complemental Patriarch, they say, Three Kisses gave it, and intreated it To bear those Tokens unto Jesu's feet. 416 But at the trembling Cave arriv'd, it found What there those fate-controlling Words had done; Shatter'd and scatter'd all about the ground Lay adamantine Chains which Death had on The Carcasse heap'd; broke was that Cloud of Lead Which roll'd cold Night about the Eyes and Head. 417 Away the frighted Worms scrambled amain; Corruption hied her self into a hole, To sneak aside pale Ghastlyness was fain; Stark frozen Stiffness felt its thaw, and stole Far from the Corps; Death sate lamenting by To see that what he slew, now must not die. 418 Heat, Vigor, Motion, hover'd round about, Attending when the Soul her place would take: And she, as quick's her own most sudden Thought Flew strait into the Heart, and there awoke The sleeping Blood: When lo, whilst yet the sound Of Jesu's Voice did in the Tomb rebound, 419 Out Lazarus leaps: O what Amazement now On all Spectators seiz'd! they start, they stare, They gape, they doubt, they hope, they fear, they throw Their arms wide open, and divided are 'Twixt wondering at Lazarus, and at Him Whose Word Mortality's strong tide could stem. 420 Out Lazarus leaps, though snarl'd fast and ty'd Up in his funeral cloths: for why should he Be by these slender ligaments deny'd Free passage, whom the stout Conspiracy Of all Death's massy chains could not compel A pris'ner in his sepulchre to dwell! 421 Out Lazarus leaps; and full as fresh and fair As summer flowers spring from their winter bed, Which at their rising, through the purest air A daintier gale of fragrant Odours shed: Nice jealous Martha needs not doubt but he Is now as wholesom and as sweet as she. 422 But wonder not why Jesus back would call His Friend who lay compos'd in rest and peace, To this tumultuous World, which seems to all Heav'n-aiming Saints the sink of Wretchedness; Whence, till by falling to their graves they rise, They count their Death lives, and their Life but dies. 423 For seeing now Himself was breathing here, His Breath perfum'd the Earth with heav'nly Bliss; His face was Rest's and Pleasure's fairest sphere; Musick, his Words; his Presence, Paradise. And where soe'r he is, his friends he warms With dearer Joys and Peace than Abraham's arms. 424 Alas 'twas Abraham's proudest Wish, that he Might see, what Lazarus freely now beheld, Him, and his Wonders, whose Benignity All faithful Souls with Satisfaction fill'd; Who to his Foes his tender favour spread; With health reliev'd the sick; with life the Dead. 425 Such, Psyche, were those Arts and Acts, whereby Thy Savior to his World himself indear'd; But in so vast a multiplicity That were they all distinctly register'd, That World's whole bounds would not sufficient be To find those only Books a Library. 426 And what meant these miraculous Dispensations But his Affection to proclaim intire? No royal Suter by such Demonstrations E'r sealed to his Queen his true Desire; As here the Prince of heav'n display'd, to prove How with all Human Souls he was in love. 427 Here Phylax clos'd his ruby lips; and She Who all this while upon his tongue attended Both with her ears and heart, was griev'd to see His high and sweet Discourse so quickly ended: Yet glad for what sh' had heard, her Modesty Paid him her maiden thanks upon her knee. CANTO XI. The Traitor. The ARGUMENT. In sordid Love of thick and rusting Clay, Prodigious Judas LOVE himself doth sell: But for his pains, besides the Highpriest's Pay, Receives a dreadful Sallary of Hell, Which met him upon earth, and from his foul And splitting body tore his wounded Soul. 1 Envy, thou rankling Bane of Quietness, And of thy Self; what makes thy Rage so Mad To play the Canker in all kind of Bliss, And on thine own Vexation live! A Rod To thine own wretched back, most peevish Elf No less than to the World's, thou mak'st thy self. 2 All other Monsters are content to spare Themselves, and only feast upon their Prey: But whensoe'r thy Prizes fattest are, Thou pinest most; and find'st a cursed way Strangely to fast in riot, and to grow Leanest when Plenty's streams about thee flow. 3 In thy mischievous womb was Discord bred, The correspondent Brat of such a Dame; A Brook which well becomes its Fountain head, And can with equal genuine poison stream; A Brook which round about the tainted World Its arms pernicious Embrace hath hurl'd. 4 This is that fatal and destructive Jar Which frets and interrupts the Harmony Wherein all different Things concenter'd were By peaceful Nature's sweet and sacred Ty: That Jar which in Time's nonage belk'd and beat So high, that ope to War the way it set. 5 To War, that foulest fiercest Sum of all The worst of Hell: fell Belzebub at first Begot the Monster of his own proud Gall, From whence in Heav'n unhappily it burst: A Birth-place how unfit for such a Birth! And well it was that Heav'n strait cast it forth. 6 Heav'n cast it forth: but Hell receiv'd the Brat, And hug'd it close, and nurst, and kept it warm; Fed there with fire and blood, it soon grew fat And strong enough to raise a desperate storm In his black Nursury, whose rampant Revels In wild confusion tumbled all the Devils. 7 When Satan saw his mad Activity, With hellish joy he kiss'd his genuine Son; And as he kick'd his Father's Courtesy, And scratch'd his kissing lips; this Sign alone Dear Child, cry'd He, sufficient is to prove Thou art my Issue, and deserv'st my love. 8 Then from his own viperous Tresses He Pluck'd three large handfuls of his longest Snakes, Of which, with pois'nous liberality, A favour for his darling Child he makes; Who ever since in frightful triumph wears The hissing Discord all about his ears. 9 He thus adorn'd without, and stor'd within With sutable desires: a full Commission Sole General to be of every Sin, Of all Confusion, and of all Perdition His Father grants him; and then sends him forth To try what ruins he could work on Earth. 10 (The cunning Serpent lov'd his Hole too well To suffer desperate War to harbour there He knew that ev'n in his own Realm of Hell Division would the joints and cement tear. Which in obedience to his sovereign Pride The Peers and Commons of Damnation ty'd.) 11 As through the bowels of deep Tellus He Rent ope his way, amazed Nature shook, Affrighted Quiet and Serenity Their ardent flight to Heav'n for shelter took; Leaving behind an universal Groan: Through all the World such fatal Terror ran. 12 But blustering on the Fury sought where he Might entertainment for his Mischief meet. First to the Lyons' Dens he rush'd, to see Whether their mighty Mouths, and armed feet Might not be taught to manage with delight The endless Quarrel of intestine Spight. 13 Big things he spoke, and highly magnify'd The sweets of Licence and unbounded Will; The gallant triumphs of that venturous Pride Which scorning all the sheepish pleas of chill And timorous Tenderness, upon the head Of Nature's strictest Laws could freely tread. 14 The royal Beasts with generous disdain Look'd on the Monster, and lay couchant still, Wisely resolv'd Themselvs to hold the chain Of their own Strength; and, when they pleas'd to fill Their Lust with Blood, to hunt it up and down The Woods, but never riot in their own. 15 Repulsed here; He made the like Address To Dragons, Tigres, Panthers, Wolves, and Bears: But they still hug'd their natural Friendlyness Sealing against his charms their honest ears. The Monster vex'd, and tore himself, to see That wildest Creatures would not disagree. 16 Then Eagles, Vultures, Harpyes, and the brood Of every cruel-beak'd fierce-tallon'd Bird To mutual Salvagenesses' trade he woo'd: But sober they their warey wings bestir'd, And flying from his barbarous Advice Traffick'd for Prey among their Enemies. 17 At last to Man he came: and who could dream That sweetly-temper'd He, the only Thing Which Heav'n's peculiar Hand vouchaf'd to frame; He who could fight for nothing, being King Of all this world; He who unarm'd was made; Should turn Apprentice to the Warlike Trade! 18 Yet Man, the Riddle of all Monstrousness, To this wild Monster desperate welcome gave: Mad Man, for whom a thousand Maladies Perpetually were digging ope his grave, Would needs go learn a surer speedyer way To cut that Life which posteth to Decay. 19 For Cain (th'original Curse's firstborn Heir,) No sooner saw the Fury's looks, but he More ameable fancy'd them and fair, Then gentle Abel's blessed Suavity. Ah wretched Fancy, whose blind Violence Murder'd a Quarter of the World at once! 20 Yea more than so: for that inhumane Wound Which in his Brother's Body sunk so deep, Did on himself more fatally rebound, And in his Soul the cursed Weapon steep: Such is his self-revenging Guilt, that Cain The living Murderer's more than Abel slain. 21 Yet could that dreadful Mark's all-warning sight, Which seal'd his Crime on his despairing face, From venturing in his bloody steps not fright Succeeding Generations; still they trace The guilty Tract, regardless of the Cries With which Blood wakens Vengeance and the Skies. 22 With unrelenting Steel they barbarize Their tender Flesh, and cloth their skin with Brass; They for Destruction proper Tools devise To hasten on the fate of fading Grass; To Time's not lazy Sithe they join their arts Of Death, Spears, Arrows, Daggers, Swords, and Darts. 23 And loth that any dull Delay should make Them loose the credit of their Madness, They Trust not their own two feet, but mount the back Of fiery Quadrupeds; with cruel joy Flying to salvageness in full carreer, And triumphing their brethren's hearts to tear. 24 Yea though the Vengeance of that Deluge, which Washed away that bloody Torrent, and Those who rejoic'd to quaff it; well might teach Poor Man how needless 'twas to arm his hand Against himself: He still resolv'd no Flood Of Water should confute his Thirst of Blood. 25 O no! He more industrious daily grows In butchering Wrath, and with it taints the heart Of gentle Learning, which his cunning draws In all his bloodyest Plots to act its part. Hence came those Engins which so strangely spit Death's multiply'd and deadlyer made by Wit. 26 Yea these, as Rage's Lameness He disdains, Angry to see that Heav'n's Artillery flies Swifter than his: this made him bend his brains To shoot his fury like th'incensed Skies: Thus from his Canon's mouths the Thunders roar, The Lightnings flash, smoke, Bullets, Vengeance pour. 27 No snaky Feinds with more remorseless spight Rend one another's breasts, than Man doth Man's: Wounds, Shrieks and Gaspings are his proud Delight; And he by Hellishness his Prowess scans: In humane Blood he strives to write his stories, And by his Murders counteth up his Glories. 28 Thus milde Humanity aside is thrown, And Manhood takes from War its ominous Name. Alas! and was not genuine Manhood known Till Pride and Spight disjointed Nature's frame; Till Beasts upbraided Man, who entertain'd That horrid Monster which all They disdain'd? 29 Were there not lusty Sins, whose sturdy might Sufficient fuel could afford to feed The boldest valour of the bravest Wight; And with a fairer Laurel court his Head, Than those unhappy wreaths which smeared are Thick in the gore of an unnatural war. 30 Had not each Breast their enemies at home, With which no truce could honorable be? Was any Heart of Man secured from The headstrong Passion's dangerous mutiny? There, there that Field was to be pitch'd, wherein True Virtue might the noblest Prizes win. 31 But ah! that blessed Combat is forgot In this wild heat of fighting: Licence here Commands in chief, and from its Quarters shut Law, Property, and sober Order are: In whose fair rooms the foul Troops listed be Of rampant Rage, Rapes, Rapines, Luxury. 32 For when this more than brutish General once In lawless gulfs himself had plunged, he Prints on his mad adventure's exigence, The specious title of Necessity: To which he blushes not to count the Law, Whether of Earth or Heav'n oblig'd to bow. 33 Shame on their Souls, who love this Trade of Hate At others, and their own destruction's price, From their own bosoms quite erasing what Might prove them Men. But their impieties Swell highest, who the Name of Christian wear, Yet stain it in the blood of causeless War. 34 Impudent Boldness! which can to advance Most meek Religion, put on Barbarousness, And make the Bond of Sweetness their pretence, To break all other yoaks; which dares profess In fights to rescue that, whose highest praise Injurious suff'rings always us'd to raise. 35 Which garrisons the Pulpits first, and makes The venal Tongues of roaring Preachers set The Trumpets their alarming Tune: which seeks To plunder Consciences, and to defeat Unarmed Souls, before its faulchions hack Their Bodies, or their Goods its paws attack. 36 Which in despight of God will take his part, And war for Heav'n, against Heav'n's flat Command: Which with a Brazen-face, and harder Heart Under the Cross's Banner marches, and Makes Patience's noblest Trophy over Th'unruly head of bloody Fury hover. 37 Which to maintain the Church, her maintenance Grasps and devours: which licenseth the Flock To tear the Shepherds: which in Truth's defence Imprison her, and to complete the Mock, Breaks open Hell, and lets loose thousands fries Of giddy Schisms, and frantick Heresies. 38 Which, if defeated, by an hardy Lye, Recruits its credit, and before the face Of scoffed Heav'n in proud solemnity, Enacts Thanksgivings: which accounteth Peace Its most assured ruin; and no snares Like those of honest sober Treaties fears. 39 The glorious Army of those Martyrs, who To Heav'n in Triumph's Chariot ascended, And never learn'd Christ and Religion so; Both which they by a surer way defended, Drowning all opposition in the flood, Not of their foes, but of their own brave Blood. 40 Nor did Heav'n's most propicious bottles e'er Distil more fertile showers on thirsty Earth; Than streamed from those Heros' veins, to cheer The new-sown Churches' Seeds, and help them forth Into that sudden goodly Crop, which swell'd So high, that all the wondering World it fill'd. 41 Can others' Blood their tincture be, who are Sworn servants to the King of sweetest Peace? That King who deign'd to be a Lamb, and wear Of Tenderness the white and dainty fleece? That King whose business, and whose dearest joy It is to save, but never to destroy. 42 That King, who to this World forbore to stoop, Till every sword return'd unto its sheath; Till Quiet sealed Janus's Temple up; Till Nature was restor'd to lead on Death; Till Peace's calm had pav'd his passage plain, And Men repented into Men again. 43 Yet being come; though Satan could not raise An open tempest to disturb him, he Contrives a thousand secret envious ways, Patching his want of force with subtilty: He lends fresh malice to the peevish Jews, And in the High-priest's Head his projects brews. 44 Annas and Caiaphas conspire to try How their popular Glories may protect, Which daily they beheld eclipsed by The splendor which the Name of Jesus deckt; Upon whose flames, if nothing else will do, Rather than fail, his Blood they plot to throw. 45 And Phylax, through this Story's tract thought fit Psyche's attention to lead; for He After their short reposement, bids her sit Steady and fast: and yielding then the free And long-desired reins to's fervid Steeds, Quick as the wind to Salemward he speeds. 46 There, over Sion's head he plucked back The bridle; strait his docile Coursers knew The language of his hand, an 'gan to slack Their pace, and in a semicircle flew; For by one wing they the other fought, And damp'd their course by wheeling thus about. 47 Then lighting on the Hill, their mains they shaked, And lifting high their heads, toss'd up their voice: The bottoms at their mighty neighings quaked, And from their caves flung back the doubled noise: Till Phylax spake; when with fair manners they Humbled their awed crests, and ceas'd to neigh. 48 Though to this World thy Lord himself, said he, So much indear'd by those sweet Miracles, A taste of which I have presented thee: Yet so importunately loud was Hell's Invidious clamor in the High-priest's ear, As all Heav'n's words and works to overbear. 49 And now the thicker Wonders Jesus does, More Articles against himself he draws: The shameless Judges turn his vowed foes, Forgetting Rights, and urging Envy's Laws: And in black Envy's impudent esteem, No crime so foul as Piety doth seem. 50 But how this Malice brought about her end, And rais'd her self to that transcendent pitch Of Monstrousness, which never any Fiend With Hell's most scrued wit before could reach; Deserves thy Ear and Hate: and forth will I The venom pump of that rank History. 51 Near Erebus's yawning mouth a cave there is, (The little Emblem of that greater Realm,) The native house and home of Avarice, Who though her craving thoughts quite overwhelm The Universe, yet whatsoe'r she gains, As lean and hungry as before remains. 52 If ought but Money there for entrance call, The door is deaf; for its bewitched ears No noise, no musick apprehend at all But Money's chink: which it no sooner hears, But ope it flings its mouth as fast and wide, As Tigers when their prey they welcome bid. 53 Six yellow springs before the threshold rise, Infected by that House's Neighborhood; Which stealing far, through Earth's close cavities, Disgorge their splendidly-contagious flood On this condemned World, devouring here More than in stormy Seas e'er swallow'd were. 54 Indus and Ganges range about the East; Pactolus taints the middle of the Earth; But Tagus undertakes to cheat the West, And spews in Spain his glistering poison forth; The North is Hebrus's charge, and treacherous he Breaks ope his way through Thracian Rhodope. 55 Plate slips into the further World, to put To pains and cost adventurous Covetousness: Who, when her thirst is grown maturely hot, Will scorn th'Atlantick Ocean's fright, and press Through unknown Monsters, hunting out that stream Which shall not quench but more inrage her flame. 56 For those dire draughts of burning sulphure, that Fry all the throats of ever-howling Hell, As soon may cool, and quite confute the hot Pleas of their furious drought; as any Well, Or Stream, or Sea of wealth can slake the Fire, Which reigns in her unsatisfy'd desire. 57 The structure of the House is plain and poor, And calls with many a mouth for reparation: No Clouds can weep that way, but needs must pour, Through every rotten room an inundation: In at their pleasure whistling come the winds, And here a ready Inn all weather finds. 58 A thousand stilts and props their shoulders set To aid the walls; where many a wisp and rag Into the weather-beaten wounds are put: Such is the thrift of that old carking Hag, Her House's fall she ventures, but to spare The simple cost ev'n of a patch'd repair. 59 Within, vast mouldy Trunks and Hutches stand, Pil'd to the roof on one another's backs, Guarded with massy hoops of iron, and Warily fortify'd with triple locks: As if indeed some Treasures' shrines they were, When only yellow Clay lies sleeping there. 60 There lay that golden Mount the Lydian Prince Had raised by his numerous Victories: Unhappy Crœsus! who at such expence Of pains and time, obtain'd so sad a prize, Which prov'd his Life's sad load, and lower prest Him than his grave, when Death did him arrest. 61 There lay the Phrygian Monarch's coined God, Whose golden Wish made all his Riches poor; Whose privilege was to want ev'n what he had, And famish'd be amidst his growing store: Sure for that Wish he more deserv'd those Ears Which by the Poet's quaint revenge he wears. 62 There heaped lay his useless Talents, who By Pagan's verdict is condemn'd to thirst, Whilst mocking Currents round about him flow. Ah Tantalus! how crosly wert thou curst In Life with Treasures which thou couldst not use, In Death with Dainties which thy mouth abuse! 63 There lay the Purse of stern Callicrates, Who us'd Exaction's iron hand to rake Up gold, and make th'Athenian miseries Swell equally with his huge wealth; who brake The Laws in lawless urging them, that he Owner of what he could not keep might be. 64 The stuffed Coffers of rich Cinyras, The prisons of his Cyprian Plenty, there Congested were in mighty throngs: the Mass Of Gyges's glittering joys, which far and near Wonder and envy rais'd, lay next to them, But all abashed now with rusty shame. 65 The teeming Bags, which Pelops brooded o'r; The wealth which Crassus upon heaps had heap'd; Darius's brave inestimable store, There in their sepulchres of darkness sleep'd: So did great Pharaoh's, into whose vast barn, A crop of Gold was brought for that of Corn. 66 Whatever Rapine, Fraud, Oppression, Lies, Distrustful Greediness, vexatious Care, Had snatch'd, stole, poll'd, or scraped, to suffice What could not filled be, was crowded there. Men little think that all such Riches will Go home at last, and with their Plutus dwell. 67 Nay, there that proud Accumulation lay Which dares call every other Treasures poor; That wealth which did the Golden Age display, When Solomon the Crown of Israel wore; Who such disgrace on silver pour'd, that it Like vulgar stones was kick'd about the street. 68 Wise as he was, that King well understood That with those huge ador'd Vacuities, Which puff the World up with their frothy flood, Ev'n massy Gold must counted be; which flies Away on wings more swift than any thing That Fortune rolls in Vanity's fine Ring. 69 He understood how Men's fond estimation Gilds that by which they gild all things beside; How in the Coach of their own admiration, They make pale Earth in glorious triumph ride; For though their poring sight be weak and gross, His eye discern'd that Gold it self is dross. 70 Alas, as here in all its strength it lay Immur'd in thousand Chests, it could not by Its power, or its value keep away Æruginous Cankers, which eternally Both dwell and feed upon it; nor could all Those mighty Locks forbid their Festival. 71 But howling round about the woful room, Ran those unhappy Souls, whose thirst of Gold Had plung'd them in this everlasting Doom: Souls, which to their own Bags themselves had sold, And bought their Prison; from whose misery Their useless wealth could no Redemption buy. 72 His mystick Wand there wrinkled Balaam crack'd, And flung his wretched Charms about the floor; Cursing the day when he to Balak pack'd In sordid love of vile-bred Mony more Than Truth and Heav'n; and crying oft, Alas, Who was the Wizzard then, and who the Ass! 73 There guilty Achan roar'd, himself to see So gorgeous in his Babylonish Cloak; Besides, to make him rich in misery, Deep in his heart his Golden Wedge was stuck: And his two hundred silver Shekels fast About his feet were into fetters cast. 74 There cursed Ahab with Soul-gnawing fright, Thought Naboth's Ghost came flashing in his face; Whose guiltless Blood quite quenched that delight With which the Vine's should have inflam'd his glass: For all the stones which Calumny had thrown On Naboth's head, he felt upon his own. 75 Gehazy there, as white with Leprosy As guilt had dy'd him odious and black, His double Change of Garments hates; which he Can for his noisome sores no cover make; And still he starts, and thinks his Master's eye Doth him and his two Syrian Talents spy. 76 There Dives rends his Purple, and away Kicks his now bitterly-delicious Feasts: His Envy snarleth at his Dogs, since they Less dogged were than He to needy Guests; Whose boils they kindly kiss'd and lick'd, whilst He With cruel railings griev'd their misery. 77 There Demas curses all the World, with which His Gold-bewitched Soul in love did fall; Lamenting his vain plot of growing rich, By flowing from the Poverty of Paul; That glorious Poverty which to the fair Treasures of Heav'n was now the granted heir. 78 This ugly Room the decent Portal was Into the Temple miserably builded Of equal vileness: yet with lofty grace Its ruinous Roof was screwed up, and yielded Full space for Majesty to stand upright, And let the God appear in his own height. 79 Hast thou not heard how, when on Dura's Plain Nebuchadnezzar's Oven's hot mouth did gape For those who fear'd Hell's furnace, and the stain Of foul Idolatry; proud He in deep Disdain of Heav'n, rear'd sixty cubits high The Mountain of his Golden Deity? 80 The Copy of that Idol hence he took, And still th'Original in this Temple stands; Such is the massy Head and such the Look, Such are the Legs, the Breast, the Arms, the Hands; Such is its monstrous Bulk, and such the Beams, With which its pure and burnish'd metal flames. 81 His Name is Mammon; and although he be So dead a Lump, that aid he cannot lend To's heavy self; yet to [t]his Deity The most of living mortals couch and bend: Heav'n's King with all his powers of Love and Bliss, Of works on humane hearts with less success. 82 Both those who see, and those who want their eyes Are by his splendor equally invited; For both alike are blind, when once they prize His worthless worth, and feel their Souls delighted With contemplation of inchanting Money: Their fond thirst's Milk, their foolish hunger's Honey. 83 Thrift, that most slander'd thing, pretended is By every Sex and every Tribe of Men; Who spare no pains to spare; who weigh their Bliss In Gold's false scales; who gain not what they win; Who fretted by th'immediate itch Of heaping riches, ne'r think they are rich. 84 Some Young, and Poor; most Old, and Wealthy, at The Idol's footstool reverently lay: Active and stout was their Devotion's heat, Disdaining any respit night or day; And mortifying with hard penance what Soever Mammon's Laws allowed not. 85 Where'r He sent them, to the East or West, The North or South; no War of Heat or Cold, Of Seas or Tempests, ever could resist Their venturous March, or make too dear their Gold; Nor could Earth's mass their hardy pains repel; Through Mountains they would dive, and dig to Hell. 86 Thick at his shadowed feet there grew a Crop Of every villany which taints this Earth; Fruits which those fond Devotos gather'd up As fast's the pois'ned roots could bring them forth: The Golden Crime's Prerogative is such, That it in other sins is always rich. 87 In other sins, and in the righteous Curse Which by wise Vengeance is eternally Ty'd to the strings of th'avaricious Purse; For still those Cormorants are tortured by Vexatious cares and fears of Want the more: They are incumbred with their growing Store. 88 That Store, which with such tyrannising aw In endless bondage holds their Souls, that they, Though on their Lips their golden Torrents flow, Yet durst not with one drop their thirst allay; But choose to antidate their Hell, and learn Betimes in everlasting Drought to burn. 89 The Priest, whose service waits upon this Shrine, Is full as ugly as the Idol's fair: The raving wallowing Mænades, would fine Spruce courtly Ladies seem compar'd with Her; So would the rankest Witch that ever yet Disfigur'd was in any Magick fit. 90 Age bends her downward to that Earth in which To delve and grope, is her profound delight: As are the backs of bunched Camels, such Is Her's, and sutes as well with any weight; All load is light to Her, if but a grain Of intermixed Profit it contain. 91 Her face all over's plowed up with Care, And gastly deep the wretched furrows be: Her hollow Eyes quite damp'd, and dazell'd are By glaring on her glistering Deity: Her sallow Looks, and shrivell'd parched Skin Confess what pains she takes about her Sin. 92 Her Nails she never cut, but let them grow Up with her Wealth, since Scraping was her Trade: No greedy Vultures could such Tallons show, And with such hungry hooks no Harpys prey'd: For with these Engines she was wont to break Mine's bowels open, and the Center rake. 93 A putrid Mantle round her stinking Waste Was all the Robes she would her self allow, Which she had found upon a dunghil cast A thousand years before; and which was now Nine hundred times repatch'd: so deeply did Her Soul the charges of a new one dread. 94 Seven stuffed Pouches on a leathern thong Crouded about her miserable Loins; With these, of massy Keyes two bunches hung, The Memorandums of her Treasur'd Mines: Which Keyes she twenty times a day would tell, And count what sums did in their keeping dwell. 95 Though thousand tongues with righteous indignation Pour'd shames and curses on her sordid Head, She scorn'd to blush, or from her self-vexation Release her anxious Soul; for still she fed Her Thoughts with hopes of more and more, and still Went on, what never bottom had, to fill. 96 Patrocles was to Her a generous Knight, And made his Board fat lavishness's scene: When she with Dainties would her Taste delight, Some rotten Root her Banquet was; and when Her fare she ventur'd highliest to enlarge, She'd be in salt at half a farthing's charge. 97 But planted deep she carried in her Breast The horrid Root of all her monstrous cares, Blind Infidelity; by which she cast About how to withstand what her own fears Made terrible; and built her trust upon No Power or Providence, but her own alone. 98 Besides, th'Ideas of her Gold, which lay Pil'd there in cursed Mountains, rusty grew; This Rust, its dwelling turn'd into its prey, And on her Heart with restless gnawing flew: Yet was her Idol to that Heart so dear, That for more Money she more Rust would bear. 99 This Hag was Avarice; whom Satan's Soul Lov'd near as much as he thy Spouse did hate. On her might's Axel he presum'd to roul His final hopes of compassing his great Design of Malice; knowing well that she Much more with Men could do, than Heav'n or He. 100 To her vile Grot himself in person came; Where with all condescent of courtesy, Wiping aside the sulphur and the flame, Which flash'd about his royal Count'nance, He Saluted her, who never had the Bliss Obtain'd till now of her grand Sovereign's Kiss. 101 This favour ravish'd her so deep, that She The Task he set her triumph'd to receive: First taking her Commission on her knee, (Which thrice she kiss'd) and then her hasty leave, To earth she posts, and findeth there a Cell Almost as hellish as her native hell. 102 For to Iscariot's breast her way she snatch'd Which foolish he left ope without a guard: With al her venom in she rush'd, and pitch'd Down in the bottom of his heart: full hard It was e'r she intruded there; but now No marble could such proofs of Stiffness show. 103 Those Words of potent Sweetness which did drop From Jesu's blessed lips, could Winds, and Seas, And Sicknesses, and Devils bridle up, And any Storms but Judas his appease. Alas, that Man should that sole Monster be Which is too hard for Mercy's Suavity! 104 As he who boiling Lead hath swallow'd down, As violently burns as it; and though A thousand Seas into his cup were thrown, They could not quench his drought: so Judas now Feels his impois'ned belking bosom fry In covetous Thirsts impatient ardency. 105 Millions of thoughts run raging through his breast, And every one of these is all on fire: He scorns and hates the Poverty of Christ; No Bliss but Money lureth his desire: Talk not to him of penniless Piety; Whate'r it cost, he must have Coin, or die. 106 Ah strange Resolve! as if Life's Soul were Coin, Which only paves the way, to flattering Death. Fond Wretch! who liv'd whilst he did poor remain, But when for sinful Wealth he trafficks, both His Money and his Life that Trading cost him, And every thing but mere Perdition lost him. 107 Yet was this Poison not enough to swell His heart: another joyned in the Plot: Deep in the nasty sink, of lowest Hell Is situate a dismal gloomy Grot; A Grot which there in ambush seems to lie Hatching the egs of all Conspiracy. 108 And yet within a goodly House was built, As for the Palace of some virgin Queen: With quaint Designs the frontispice was gilt; The total Fabrick smil'd like Beautie's Scene; Through all the Walls white vains of marble ran; And yet the Workmanship outshin'd the stone. 109 What full Balconies, stately Terrasses, Spruce Anticks, fair Compartments, handsome Cants, Elaborate freezes, graceful Cornishes, Brisk and wellorder'd Turrets! nothing wants That art could give to make the Outside fine; Yet still the House is gallanter within. 110 The double Door with open lips invites All Passengers; th'officious Porter there, Completely learn'd in complemental Rites, Kind welcome bids them with his vocal cheer; He smiles, he bows, he fawns, he knows the Name Of all the Guests; and in he ushers them. 111 The Hall's large Pavement silken Carpets spread To court the strangers' feet with soft delight; The dainty Roof is arched over head With checker'd Roses red, and Lilies white; Their precious Vapours liberal Odors deal, And round the room sweet entertainments thrill. 112 But at the upper-end upon a throne Of moderate height sits crafty Treachery; A Fury older than her Hell, and one Whose years would by her Count'nance witness'd be, Had Art not interven'd, and taught her how To make false Spring upon true Winter grow. 113 Craz'd Jezabel's lank and wrinckled face, was yet Less out of shape than hers; until she found A Paint's Hypocrisy to garnish it, And with a youthful verdure cloth it round; Thus came her Chinks, all stopp'd, and either cheek With beauteous politure grew plump and sleek. 114 Though thousand frowns her thoughts had overspred, Her outward Aspect wore a gentle guise; Loves, Joyes, and Smiles were sweetly marshalled About her lips, her forehead, and her eyes: Brave Judith's lovely glances ne'r could dart More potent charms at Oloferne's heart. 115 Her Tresses, which indeed were Knots of Snakes. She overlaid with lies of dainty Hair; Whose waving circling net of amber takes Spectators' souls as well's the sporting Air; Atchieving no less valiant wonders, than The mighty Locks of Manoah's conquering Son. 116 An Olive Branch adorn'd her dexter hand, Her sinister a Wreath of Roses: but The Wreath was slyly lin'd with Nettles, and The gentle Branch with ireful thorns beset: For this was She who Peace could teach to fall To Massacres, and Sweets to flow with Gall. 117 Her robe of state stream'd full about her feet; For such they fondly were esteem'd, whilst hid: But she had neither feet nor legs; a great And knotty Tail hung sweeping in their stead; A Tail which she about her round could wind, And hug and kiss the Sting she ware behind. 118 The Siren thus, above the Water, is As soft and smooth and clear a Nymph as she; But her Catastrophe of Monstrousness Lurks underneath with warey subtilty; Whilst the most fairly foul contriveth how To keep the Maid aloft, the fish below. 119 Whene'r she speaks, a flood of honey flows, And with her breath a cloud of odours breaks; Yet in her mouth a crop of poison grows; Between her lips a brood of adders makes Its cursed nest; her tounge's a mortal spear, And all her teeth invenom'd arrows are. 120 But in her desperate bosom treasur'd lies The fatal Marrow and the Pith of Hell; Spight, Tumults, open Wars, Impieties, Confusions, Desolations. Who can tell The Monsters of that black Abyss, wherein Full room is found for all the Sea of Sin. 121 Her chosen Courtiers waiting round her throne Were fulfed Peace, and buxom Courtisey, Freehearted Friendship, mild Compassion, Neat Complement and golden Flattery, Nimble Officiousness, large Promises, Deep Oaths, false Truths, insidious Faithfulness. 122 Sweet angel-faced things, restored Laws, Reform'd Religion, rescu'd Liberty; For such the Vulgars' silly faith, which knows Not what a Vizzard means, presumes they be; Admiring for celestial Spirits of Light The masked furies of infernal Night. 123 But at her back the Crew whom most she tenders Behind a Vail's dissimulation lies; Scoffs, Calumnies, Excise, Assessments, Plunders, Ingagements, Covenants, Pulpit villanies, Thanksgivings, Fasts, Law-ruining Exigences, Sacred Rebellions, Murdering of Princes. 124 Beyond which vail, an iron Portal led Into a Dungeon stuff'd with fire and smoke; A Dungeon horribly replenished With all Damnation's furniture, whose look Tortur'd with endless fright those Pris'ners which Lay in that Jail of everburning Pitch. 125 Grief liv'd in triumph there, and all the Pains Profest excess: the Language of the Den Was Sighs, and Groans, and noise of tumbled Chains, Cries, yellings, Curses, Blasphemies of Men And God himself, eternal Seizing by The Souls which Vengeance doomed there to fry. 126 On Cain's most guilty brow there might you read A deeper Mark than God upon it set, His innocent Brother's Blood, which scalt and fed Upon its seat: his breast this made him beat, And now with truer reason cry, My Pain Is greater than my Patience can sustain. 127 No longer now he dreaded to be slain, But wish'd to meet another Lamech who Might rid him of this dying Life: in vain He gnash'd his teeth; in vain he curs'd his Woe, And Him who chain'd him in it; for his Grief Sunk now below the region of Relief. 128 That Millstone which his cruel brains had grown'd, Abimelech there counteth soft and light: For now a Stone more ponderous he found Squeazing his Soul with full Damnation's Weight; That Stone he made his desperate altar, when To's Pride he sacrific'd his Bretheren. 129 There Delilah lay tearing off her Hair To think of whose her traiterous sheers had clipp'd; The twisted Withes and Ropes less sturdy were Than those her falsehood now on her had heap'd: Those Chains, which bound her to her endless rack, Stronger than Samson's sinewy arms could break. 130 There lay fierce Joab, with his woful hand Clap'd on his fift Rib: for th'insidious Wound He thought he seal'd so sure on Abner, and On Amasa, did on himself rebound! Just David's Will, and Solomon's Command This Legacy gave him by Benaia's hand. 131 Falsehearted Rechab, and Baanah there With everlasting horror seem'd to see The Trunk of righteous Ishbosheth, and hear His dying Groans upbraid their Treachery. Gladly would they, to buy off this their pain, Give both their heads that his were on again. 132 There hung rebellious Absalom by his Head Not on an Oak, but on a fiery Tree, Whose boughs of Torture round about him spread, And shadow'd him with flaming Misery: Three Darts stuck in his double Heart, and made Way for the stinging Worm therein to feed. 133 His Tongue its popular blandishments forgot, By which it stole the Vulgars' loyalty, And nothing now but ugly Curses spit: Whence his religious Sire, whose piercing eye Descry'd his Doom, tun'd by no other key His Lamentation, but Extremity. 134 There Ziba pour'd deep detestations on That fawning Lie, which help'd his fraud to gain Upright Mephibosheth's Possession, From which he reap'd this crop of endless Pain. There Shimei rail'd on his own Railing, who Had heap'd his curses on his Sovereign's Woe. 135 The Pride of ready Wit, Ahitophel With all his Plots about his halter wound, Hung sadly there: and now the Oracle No Answers gave, but hideously profound Yellings and roars, which plain confession made That he himself more than his King betray'd. 136 There Zimri howl'd to think how he was more With Treason drunk, than Elah was with Wine; And now much fiercelyer flaming tortures bore, Than when his Palace all on fire did shine. There Shallum felt himself for ever by The wounds which murder'd Zachariah, die. 137 There in their torn bemangled Flesh, and in Their broken bones, the Median Peers beheld Their Treason's recompence; and found this Den More full of Terror, and more surely seal'd, Than that in which their cursed Fraudulence Had plunged blessed Daniel's Innocence. 138 These and ten thousand more liv'd dying there; For deep and large the woful Dungeon was, And for their latest Heirs had room to spare; Choise room for those to whom the loftiest place Of most profound Damnation was due, The Christian-seeming Trayterous-being Crew. 139 That Crew, whose shameless zeal pretends to set Christ on his throne, by pulling down his House: Who vow to make their Princes glorious, yet With monstrous triumph in their blood carrouse. That Crew, whose Pride and Lust's their only Reason; Whose highest Sanctity deep-layed Treason. 140 That Crew, whose several Stalls were ready built Of burning brass, and all in order placed (According to the merit of their Guilt) About a Throne, whose canopy was graced, With flames of sovereign Dreadfulness, a Throne Wide gaping for Perdition's venturous Son. 141 For 'twas establish'd for prodigious Him Whom Jesus would have crowned King above; But Judas in an heav'nly Diadem Would nothing find which might oblige his love; With desperate impudence resolv'd was He To earn his torment's Principality. 142 For hither now hell's anxious Monarch came, As to the Den of Avarice before; When she beheld her dreadful Lord, the Dame Leap'd from her chair, and met him at the door, Where on her face, she humbly asked what Occasion brought his Highness to her grot. 143 His red hot iron sceptre Satan here Reach'd forth for her to kiss in sign of peace: Then smiling on her answering face, Most dear Of all my Feinds, said he, my bus'ness is The weightyest that my Spight e'r undertook, Which if it fails, this Sceptre must be broke. 144 Thou knowst time was when I and thou, did make A brave Adventure in the face of Heav'n, When at our Courage all the spheres did quake, And God was to his utmost thunder driven; His Throne stood trembling at our rival Power, And had our foot not slipp'd, all had been our. 145 But that Mishap's too sleight and weak to break The strength of our immortal Pride; forbid It all my Hell, that Belzebub should make Truce with that Tyrant who disherited Him of his starry Kingdom: No; I may Perchance be beaten, but will ne'r obey. 146 I am resolv'd to find Him work as long As He, and his Eternity can last; My Spirit never must forget that wrong Which me into this hateful Dungeon cast: Nor need I fear Him now, since I can be But still in Hell, should He still conquer me. 147 Full well I know his spight: had any Place Been worse than this, he would have damn'd Us thither: Yet He, forsooth, must be the God of grace, Of Pity, and of Tenderness the Father: And silly Men believe him too; but We More wit have bought than so befool'd to be. 148 For be he what he will to Men; to Us He is a sworn and everlasting Foe. And is 't not just, He who maligns Us thus, Should find that Devils are immortal too? I would not wrong Him; yet mine own must I Not clip, to save intire his Majesty. 149 My noble Will He never yet subdued, And I am now too old to learn to bow: Upon my youth his utmost strength He shewed, Yet tender though I was, himself doth know Ev'n then I yielded not: And shall this fist Now brawny grown, the Tyrant not resist? 150 It must and shall: my Confidence beats high; For now on evener ground our fight shall be. He from steep slippery heav'n is come; and my Footing on earth as sure as His will be. Besides, should we miscarry, We are there Nearer our hell, and no deep fall can fear. 151 Yet that we may unlucky Chance defy, Wise Treason must direct our Project's way: Lend thou thine aid, and let th'iniquity Of Fate or Fortune, if it can, say nay. How oft when Rams in vain have push'd the Wall, Have cunning Underminings made it fall: 152 It can be no dishonor now, since He Hath in the vile hypocrisy of Dust And Ashes hid his heav'nly Majesty, For Belzebub on Fraud to build his trust. 'Tis true, I scorn to trace his steps; yet may I justly Him in his own Coin repay. 153 Come, let's away: with hate to Christ I burn More than with all my kingdom's flames. I swear By my bright Mother, th'undefiled Morn (A fairer Virgin than the Carpenter Chose when he hew'd out Him;) by this my Crown, And Horns, I'l win his blood, or lose mine own. 154 The cursed Souls within all heard him swear, And clapp'd with damned joy their flaming pawes, Hoping some fresh Companions destin'd were To share in pangs with them: Hell op'd its jaws; Earth split into a mighty gap; and He Ascended with his Handmaid Treachery. 155 Then having melted both himself, and Her Into the next Wind's pliant lap he met, He sliely flew to Juda's bosom; where In with his breath he unperceived shot. Thus other Plagues infused in the air With pois'nous stealth down to the Heart repair. 156 As when a Tyrant hath usurp'd the Crown, The Arms and Ensigns of the rightful Heirs He blurs, and tears, and pulls their Statues down, And in their rooms his own with triumph rears; Leaving no Sign to make the People dream Of any Sovereign extant now but him: 157 So Satan acts his spight in Juda's breast; All characters which were ingraven there Of his leige Lord and only Master Christ, His mighty Miracles, his Love, his fear, His heav'nly Life and doctrine, he defaces, And every line of Piety erases. 158 Then by the help of those Allies, which He Had there confederated (Avarice The Mother of all Mischiefs, Treachery The dextrous Midwife,) he erecteth his Black standard in th'Apostate's wretched heart, And thence his Conquest spreads to every Part. 159 For Judas now breaths nothing else but Hell, Whose fumes are tumbling all about his brain; With plots of spight and rage his fancies swell, And with contrivances of cursed Gain. No fury ever hatch'd such thoughts as He, Nor brought forth such portentuous Villainy. 160 O Treachery how desperately blind And foolish is thy piercing Policy, Which trembles not an headlong way to find How to betray its own Felicity; Which ventures to project Destruction for The Universe's only Saviour! 161 O Avarice, how flat Idolatry Is thine, who canst vile rusty Wealth prefer Before the King of heav'nly Majesty Whose beams than all thy Gold more golden are; Who canst adore what Cankers feed on, and Scorn Him on whom bright Cherubim attend! 162 Judas, the Slave of Gain, resolves to sell His most inestimable Lord; though He And He alone, his thirsty soul could fill With all the Riches of Eternity. But Avarice his heart doth so bewitch That Heav'n he'l sell, and only to be rich. 163 His Chapmen are the Priests; for they who had Betray'd God's sacred House to Merchandise, Will make no scruple to extend their trade, And count God saleable: but in the price They thrifty are, and beat their market low; But Thirty silver pieces they'l bestow. 164 They little think their Heirs in time to come Will scorn this sneaking Copy, and find reason With lusty generousness to make their Sum Suit with the brave Magnificence of Treason; When for a King (how much less precious?) they Two hundred thousand Pounds will freely pay. 165 Fy sordid Caiaphas, and Annas fy! Your Law cries shame of this unworthy Rate; Consult your Books, and see if Equity Has not the meanest Man esteemed at Full fifty Shekels: and will noble you For God and Man no more than thus allow! 166 His Worth has Jesu's Godhead lower sunk Than is the vilest Wight's that breaths your air? Bid but like Chapmen; of your credits think And by the precious Ware your Offer square. O could you purchase Him aright, the Prize Would make you rich in all felicities. 167 But thou improvident Judas, since thou art Resolved Him to sell whose value is Beyond the power of Arithmetick Art To reckon up, proportion but thy Price In some more near degree: let thy Demand Make Buyers what they purchase understand. 168 Ask all the gold that rolls on Indus's shore, Ask all the treasures of the Eastern Main, Ask all the Earth's yet undiscovered Ore, Ask all the Pearls and Gems where Lustres reign, Ask Herod's checker, ask the Highpriest's Crown, Ask Cesar's mighty scepter and his throne. 169 Ask all the silver of the glistering Stars, Ask all the gold that flames in Titan's eyes, Ask all the Jewels of Aurora's Tears, Ask all the Smiles and Beauties of the Skies, Ask Paradise, ask whatsoever can Or cannot given be by God or Man. 170 Trade not with these, the worst of Chapmen, who So fouly under-rate thy Merchandise: To John, to Andrew, or to Peter go, Who knowing 'tis past knowledge, know the price Of their invaluable Lord; and see What for their Live's best Life they'l profer Thee. 171 Try what the Virgin-mother will bestow For Whom she values dearer than her heart; Proclaim thy Market unto Heav'n, and know, Whither wise Seraphs will not gladly part With more than thirty silver pieces for Him, whom with prostrate faces they adore. 172 Or have but patience to see what He, Not for his own, but for thy Life will give; And at what charge his Charity will be Thee from that killing Bargain to reprieve. Suspect not that his Poverty is poor; Thou keepst his Bag, but keepst not all his store. 173 Alas, though every Sin be Blindness, yet Hell knows no Crime so full of pitch as this, Nor doth the Sun of human Reason set In any Night so black as Avarice: Darkness ne'r sate so thick on Egypt's brow, As on the mental eyes of Judas now. 174 Urge him no more with Sense and Reason; He Against those tides is stifly set to row; For since no God but Money he can see, He nothing sees at all, and cares not how He makes his desperate Bargain, so he may Have but this wretched Sum in ready Pay. 175 Thus Jesu's Wisdom had contriv'd to shew The mighty patience of his Goodness; who Though from Heav'n's Glory his bright self he threw Into the arms of dust and shame, that so Man's cursed Seed he might redeem to Bliss, Sold by ungrateful Man's perverseness is. 176 And now the chink of his adored Coin Sounds in his Purse, the Traitor hasts to be As good's his wicked word, and is in pain Till forth he brings his hired Treachery. He thinks it an unworthy odious crime, To cheat the Priests, who thus had trusted him. 177 (O Enigmalick Wickedness! that He To whom his Heav'nly Lord's all-precious Love Could seem no bond of Faithfulness, should be By this most vile obligement bound, and prove So faithful to his foes! this, Psyche, this A knotty riddle to thy Phylax is. 178 So strange a thing is Man's mysterious Heart, No Angel's Eye can through its secrets run: To sound this bottom is the sovereign Art And Privilege of God himself alone: A certain proof that his sole fingers did Write those dark Lines, which only He can read.) 179 The Caytiff therefore, loth his plot should fail And Treason's matchless credit be prevented; Begg'd some assistance, that he might assail Omnipotence the surer, and indented To have an armed Guard: the Priests were glad To see the Man so desperately mad. 180 A Band they had, and of commanded Men Whose Hearts were iron, and whose Foreheads brass: No Boars or Tigres ever could outrun Their fury, when their aim at mischief was: Right Sovereign were these Monsters, had it not Been for their Master's and Iscariot. 181 With churlish Clubs were some appointed, some With keen and thirsty Swords, but all with Spight: In front of whom new Captain Judas came, Resolv'd to slay, but yet afraid to fight: For Cowardise in Treason's essence rests, Which fraud or number more than Valor trusts. 182 The Ensigns of this Band of Night-birds were Suspicious Lanthorns, and bold Torches, which With glaring beams awak'd the Midnight Air, Whose groping silent shades startled by such Unseasonable Apparitions, fled Behind the Hills and Trees to hide their head. 183 Thus having marched over Cedron, they To yonder Garden came, too sweet a place To be this Mischief's scene; but yet his Prey Th'insidious Serpent ventured to chase In sweetest Eden; and Iscariot, who His footsteps traced, hither chose to go. 184 Thy sacred Lord with his Disciples, there Retired was, and now began to pray: When lo, a Spectacle of direr fear March'd full against his single face, than They Whose armed spight approach to sacrifice His Patience to contempts and cruelties. 185 A black and labouring Cloud hung o'r his Head, In which his Father veil'd his gracious Eyes; Yet through that pitch his dreadful Arm he spread, And reach'd it down to Earth: from angry Skies The Lightning never with such terror broke, Nor Thunder's trump the Rocks and Mountains shook. 186 For in his Hand a mighty Cup he held, In which he made all Horrors boil and flame: Unto the brim's vast circle it was fill'd With all the World's excrementitious stream, Which Vengeance kindling with her fiery breath Had turn'd into the Ocean of Death. 187 That Universal Taint whose rankling flood From Adam's veins through all his Race had run, Met in this Sink, and joyned with the Brood Of every singular Transgression: Besides, about the Cup each several Pang, Which every several Sin deserv'd, was hung. 188 Had now the sublimated Soul of Gall, Had all the Deaths which live in Thessaly, Had every Cockatrice's egg, had all The maws of Dragons, had the Tyranny Of Spight her self, or had the odious flood Of Anna's, Caiaphas's, Iscariot's Blood. 189 Had Styx, had Phlegeton, had all that Wits Have fain'd, and all that Justice made in Hell, Had all the flames which Etna's furnace spits Had all the Stinks which in the Dead Sea dwell, Had all the Poisons of each Serpent's tongue Which Lybia frights, into the Cup been wrung. 190 The Draught had Nectar been compar'd to this: Yet loe the monstrous Mixture to the lip Of Sweetnesse's own Lord presented is. O Psyche, how shall he digest this Cup, Which were the Sons of Adam forc'd to drink, The World would drowned be in its own Sink? 191 But well He knew the Hand which lov'd his Cheeks When he in Bliss's bosom made his nest; And though so strange an Offer now it makes, 'Tis still the same: and how can he resist What his dear Father tenders him, although The Cup with Horror's own heartblood do's flow! 192 Were it as wide and deep and full again, This Thought alone commands it to be sweet; And till he drink its Pangs he is in pain, So valiant's his Obedience, and so great His Love to Man, who else must needs have quafft This dismal Boul, and perish'd in the Draught. 193 But then this Thought was justled by another, For He himself was passive flesh and Blood: Nature (whose earnest voice who e'r could smother?) Up in her own defence right strongly stood; For who can willingly be headlong hurl'd Into that Gulf which would devour the World? 194 O how He struggled in this mighty strait, Being himself with his brave self to fight! Had all the Center's most compacted Weight Pitch'd on his heart, the burden had been light, And easy unto that which squeazed He Endur'd in this heroick Agony. 195 In vain should I contend to represent What no Comparison's excess can reach; Vnknown, unknown the Sorrows were which spent Their fury on his Patience, and such As none but He himself could measure, who Resolv'd to grapple with the Soul of Woe. 196 The Contestation grew so hot within That all his bosom fell on flaming fire; And from that melting furnace, through his skin Thick Proofs of monstrous Fervor did transpire; For at the mouth of every labouring pore Not watery Sweat, but Blood broke ope its door. 197 O matchless Combat! whose mysterious power Without the edge of sword, or point of dart Could cloth Him round with lamentable gore, And wound him from within; whilst every Part Rack'd and transfixed with intestine strains, In streams of purple tears bewail'd its pains. 198 Down to the Ground this sweating Torrent pour'd, From off its Face to wash the barren Curse; Whilst moated in his melted self, thy Lord The noble fight did freshly reinforce: His Mortal Passion three stout Onsets gave To his Immortal Piety and Love. 199 Father, he cry'd, by that thy tender Name, Thy most afflicted Son commiserate: If Mercy's wisdom any way can frame How to reprieve me from this dismal fate; O let thine Hand, which brings this Cup to me, Remove, with it, my Woe's extremity. 200 But strait by most athletick bravery Mounting above himself, he noblyer cries, Although all Bitterness triumphant be In this one Cup, it must and shall suffice That from thy Hand it comes: thy sovereign Will And not mine own, shall be my Pleasure still. 201 Thus when his adamantine Fate doth call The Phenix to his grave; though Life's strong plea Urges his stay, yet to his Funeral He flies with joyful grief; where generously Blowing the fire with's wings' applauding breath, To hatch his End he broods his flaming Death. 202 Thus reverend Abraham when his God's Command Sent him to bath his sword in Isaac's blood, Divided was in his own bowels, and With his stout self in competition stood; Till valourous Piety her powers strain'd, And th'arduous Laurel of self-conquest gain'd. 203 But when thy mighty Lord atchieved had This triple Conquest: Judas and his Rout Like hungry bears into the Garden made, And for their booty rang'd and rov'd about; Not knowing He as ready was to be Betray'd, as they to act their Treachery. 204 For like a known victorious Champion, who Before his other Foes hath conquer'd Fear, He meets their Rage; demanding, whom with so Untimely strange a chase they hunted there. Them, and their Spight's design ful well he knew, Yet this brave Challenge in their face he threw. 205 Jesus of Nazareth we seek, said they. Alas, blind Souls, He came to seek out you, And lead you safely in the King's high way Up to his Realm above, that on your brow The Crown of Bliss might ever shine: but ye In nothing would be found but Treachery. 206 Nor They, nor his own Judas, Psyche, knew Thy Spouse's face; which as it flam'd before With royal beauty, so was clouded now And smear'd in's bloody Agonistik Gore. Thus like some dusky Meteor Phebus shows When an Eclipse has quench'd his glittering brows. 207 But He, who would not be unknown to those Who came to suck what blood was left behind; (That blood which burned in his veins, till loose It got, and flowed like his liberal Mind,) Revests his Look with graceful Majesty, And champion-like professes, I am He. 208 If ever thou hast seen what killing Dread Base-hearted Traitors doth arrest, when by Their injur'd Sovereign discovered Their naked Treason feels his awful Eye; Treble this fright, and then compute what fear Shot through the Souls of these vile Caytiffs here. 209 A stream of horror drove them trembling back, And overwhelm'd them flat upon the ground; Deep in the Gulph of which dismaying wrack Their shivering spirits had been for ever drown'd, Had He to Mercy's shore not snatch'd out them, The Tempest of whose fury storm'd at Him. 210 O how will they endure his radiant Eyes, Which all this World on flaming fire shall set; When He in triumph sweeping through the skies Shall hither come, and mounted on his great Tribunal, once again cry, I am He; No more the Prey, but Judge of Treachery. 211 When they no Lantern's, nor no Torch's light, Nor Judas's conduct any more shall need; But by Our Trumpet's Death-awakening fright Be summon'd from their dust, and hurried Up to the Bar of Heav'n's all-dooming Son; Whom then they would not find, but cannot shun. 212 But Bridling now this guilt-appalling splendor, And cov'nanting, that his Disciples may Safely retreat, He condescends to render Himself to his unworthy foes, who lay Quaking before him, and had quite forgot Their own fell envy, and the Highpriest Plot. 213 But feeling Life afresh their Bosoms beat, And seeing Jesus upon yielding, (since For all his braving flash, he stoop'd to Treat,) They heartned up their frighted impudence, And feared not to hope, that they might now Safely as furious as their wishes grow. 214 For as a Serpent brus'd and foil'd, if she Spies any ways to reinforce her fight, Her crest and looks she rears, and venturously Advanceth both her wrath and bane to spit: So started up these Elves, and cheer'd their head (And this Iscariot was) to do the Deed. 215 When lo, strange He, forgetful of the Fall, From which he rose but now, and fearing not The hazard of a greater, muster'd all His Impudence's power; and to get The fame of second Lucifer, led up Against the Lord of Hosts his desperate Troop. 216 Yet golden was the Arrow that he shot, Burnish'd with fair and complemental grace; Though in as mortal venom dipp'd as that Which slew Eve's Heart, when she saluted was By Fair-tongu'd Hell, and by the Tempter driven With courteous treason from her Earthly Heaven. 217 Hail, Master, was the Word: What Ear could now Disrelish such a sugar'd Noise as this! Can discord's killing-jars be taught to grow Upon a bed of Musick? Master is The phrase of service; Hail of Love; yet He Could make this sweet salute insidious be. 218 And when his faithless Tongue her part had done, His Lips succeeded in the Treachery, With flattering-bloody malice venturing on The very face of highest Majesty; For, that his cursed Project might not miss, He seal'd it on his Master with a Kiss. 219 O Wit of Treason! which abuseth thus The Paranymph of gentlest Courtesy Into the Bawd of deepest Barbarousness! Monstrous Iscariot how dost thou by thy Inhumane Kindness, both a Traitor prove Of Love's great Master, and the Pledge of Love. 220 Is not a Kiss the soft and yielding Sign Which claps the Bargain of Affection up: The sweetly-joyous Marriage between: The tenderest Pair of Lovers, Lip and Lip: The closing Harmony, which when the Tongue Has done its best, completes the pleasing Song? 221 Is not a Kiss that Mystick Stamp, which though It sinks not in, yet deep Impressions leaves: The smooth Conveyance of the Soul, which through The closed Mouth her thrilling self derives: Th'Epitomy of genuine Salutation, And Modesty's most graceful Copulation? 222 Is not a Kiss the dearly-sacred Seal Which cements happy Friends' concording hearts? Must this betrayed be! Must faithless Hell Truth's daintyest Soder taint! Must Hatred's Arts Be clothed in the delicatest Dress Of courteous Peace and amorous Tenderness! 223 Must sweet Arabia's beds belch out a Stink Outpois'ning all the Bane of Thessaly! Must milky Lilies stain their leaves with Ink! Thick-lin'd with Thorns must Buds of Roses be! Must Harshness lurk in Down! Must Honey flow With Gall! Must summer Gales bring Ice and Snow! 224 O what will Treason not presume to do, Which more than all these strange Mutations makes In this one venturous Fact of Judas; who By Love's delicious Tye all Friendship breaks; Who biteth with his Lips, not with his Teeth And plotts to Kiss his dearest Lord to death. 225 Who teacheth all Succeeding Traitors how To mask with burnish'd Gold that rankling Brass Of Impudence, which arms their sullen brow; To tip Rebellion with meek Lies; to grace Their arrogant Treaties with submissive Words Whilst at their Sovereign's heart they aim their swords. 226 But though Iscariot his own Love betrays, His Lord's triumph's beyond all Treachery, Resolv'd against the Traitor's Rage to raise An higher counter-work of Lenity: Though Jesus yields his mighty self, he will Intire maintain his tender Pity still. 227 He call'd no Lightning from the Clouds, or from His dared Eyes to flash on Judas's face, And stamp upon his Lips that flaming doom Which due to their blood-thirsty Flattery was: He charg'd not Earth her dreadful mouth to ope, And evermore this hellish Kisser's stop. 228 O no! with heav'nly Tenderness he cry'd, Friend wherefore art thou come? strange Miracle. Of most affronted Patience, which vy'd With Spight's Excess! upon the face of Hell Shall Friend's celestial Name be printed by Him who beholds and feels its Treachery! 229 Is foul Ingratitude, rank Apostasy, Right down Rebellion, into Friendship turn'd? Or rather has not this Disciple by His curs'd Revolt, a Fury's title earn'd? And will his wronged Lord by none but this Sweet Name, revenge his most invenom'd Kiss. 230 O Psyche, Jesus tortured was to see His Foe himself down into Tortures throw; And by this Charm's inviting Suavity Back into heav'n endeavor'd him to draw: He knew Love's Cords were strong, and strove by these To pluck him from his gulf of Miseries. 231 Why art thou come, thy Friend to undermine? Why art thou come, with arms against a Lamb? Why art thou come, to loose what would be thine? Why art thou come, to gain eternal shame? What means this madly-mighty Preparation, For thy Lord's death, and for thine own Damnation? 232 I in its natural Language will thy Kiss Kindly interpret, and to it reply In that dear dialect, if thou to Bliss At length wilt yield, and in my Nursery Of heav'nly Plants enjoy thy ready room: Say then my Friend, O say, Why art thou come? 233 Thus did the Prince of Sweetness woe and plead: But this deaf Serpent stopp'd his cursed ear. The stubborn bolt of thirty Pieces made, Forbad all holy Charms to enter there. When lo, the Soldiers, knowing now their Prey, On Jesus fell, and hurried him away. 234 The Spouse of Souls was thus, for love of thee Psyche, and all his other Brides, content By Judas to be viley sold, and be Insidiously destroy'd in Compliment. Shrink not if thy near Friends abuse thy love, Since God's own Favorite could so faithless prove. 235 And let the World by this one Copy learn That hell-bred Boldness is not strange or new; By which most foster'd favour'd Creatures turn Fairtongued Enemies, and lead a Crew Of Miscreants arm'd with bloody-meek Pretences Against the Powers and Persons of their Princes. 236 But mighty matter 'tis of Wonder, that They who have seen what gains Iscariot made, Are not astonished with horror at The thought of following his accursed Trade; But desperately forget what Him befel, Him, their abhorred Usher into Hell. 237 For when no Mercy could th'Apostate win To entertain his Pardon, Vengeance made Just haste to pour her self upon his Sin; Whilst Satan, of her fierce concurrence glad, His Treason in its proper coin repay'd, And this Betrayer fatally betray'd. 238 She to the Garden's grimmest corner, where Thoughtful disconsolate Night sate thick and black, Lash'd him aside; and having fitted there The implements of her infernal Rack, With studied fury, not his body, but His captivated Soul on it She put. 239 For, by a Torch, which glar'd with hellish light, She to Iscariot's intellectual eyes Her dismal Self display'd: Excessive fright Did strait his wretched helpless heart surprize; Each joint and member quak'd and sweat; and He Felt in this Garden too his Agony. 240 He saw dire Belzebub's sulphureous Look Boiling with swarthy fire; his Horns he saw High mounted on his head, which as he shook His Hair's intangled Snakes their knots did knaw: He saw his adamantine Nails and Paws, His steely Teeth, his brazen gaping Jaws. 241 He saw the Tempest of his flaming breath Which gloomy volumes spew'd of stinking smoke: He saw the windows of eternal Death Flung open in his staring Eyes, whose stroke Slew him alive: he saw his iron Mace, His burning Feet, and his enraged Pace: 242 He saw his forked Tail in triumph thrown Upon his shoulder, and his ireful Brow With cruel scorn contracted in a frown: Rampant Implacability he saw In every gesture, and too plainly read The full Description of Immortal Dread. 243 Profoundly learn'd that Lesson made him in The mighty Volumes of his own Distress: The more he look'd, the more in every line He found himself so lost, that no Redress Could glimmer in his damped Hopes, or cheer His woful Desolation's hemisphere. 244 When lo, stern Lucifer threw out his hand, And by her throat his guilty Conscience took; And now, he cry'd, I'l make thee understand What thou hast chose, and what thou hast forsook: Mark well this dainty Pair of Damsels, which Could from thy God and Heav'n thy Love bewitch. 245 Which said, he op'd to his astonish'd view The face of his adored Avarice, And Treachery; not in their former hue Of borrowed smiles and outside comelyness, But in their naked native filth: and then Shaking his Horns and Paws, he thus went on: 246 Maddest of Fools, how many Hells dost thou Deserve, who with such Hags couldst fall in love, When Jesus woo'd thy heart? these Hags, which now Th'hast paid so dearly for, must, doubtless prove Sweet Brides, and preciously adorn thy Bed Which in the bottom of my Realm is spred. 247 If they have any feature, joint, or lim Which is not horrid; may my Scepter break, And may my royal Tongue no more blaspheme. For once I tell thee true, and thou mayst take The Devil's word, in monstrous ugliness I know no Furies who thy Wives surpass. 248 And was thy Lord so vile a Thing, that He Might not with These in competition stand! Were thy unthankful Eyes e'r grac'd to see A face so rich in purest Beauties, and Majestick Graces, as in His did shine, Making Humanity appear Divine? 249 Most stupid Sot! how oft didst thou behold Divinity from his great Hand break out! How oft has his Omnipotence control'd, And put my stoutest Legions to rout! Yet still with desperate devotion thou (And here he beat the Soul,) to Me wouldst bow. 250 Nay never houl; 'tis but the Earnest, this, Of what's to come: Thou needs wouldst bow to Me, Of whom that Christ the well-known Conqueror is: He threw me down from heav'n's Sublimity Into that Pit of Pangs, where I am now The damned Sovereign of such as Thou. 251 Hadst not as good have bow'd to mightier Him, Whose Yoke thou wouldst have lighter found than mine? I tell thee Judas, I am but a grim And rugged Lord; what Prizes once I win, I grasp for ever, and shall make them fry In Torment's bottomless extremity. 252 And can my Hell, and everlasting Spight, Put on the looks of such prevailing Worth As Jesu's value to outshine! Can Night Day's lustre dazel! brings Damnation forth Such strong Temptations? can eternal Bliss Not woe and win as potently as this! 253 Sure Hell and Death are gallant Things, and I Must not allow thee them, until thou hast In all the storms of Hate and Infamy Which Salem, or the World can raise, been tost. This Preface shall for that eternal Smart Which gapes and longs for thee, prepare thine heart. 254 Go then, the Age's Blot and Monster, go; Let every Mouth spit on thy hated head; Let every Tongue thy way with Curses strow; Let every Hand be arm'd to strike thee dead; Let every Eye abhor thy baleful sight; Let all the World revenge thy traiterous Spight. 255 Let every mad Dog bark and snarl at thy More currish Look; Let every Night-raven groan Thy funeral knell; Let every Scritch-owl's Cry Teach thee to tune Death's Ejulation; Let every direful Mandrake's killing Shriek, Thy ears, thy comforts, and thy heart-strings break. 256 Let Heav'n frown on thee, and the starry Host Pour on thy soul their angryest influence, who Their and thine own great Lord betrayed hast; In one vast bolt let all God's Thunders now Conjoin their Wrath to tear obdurate Thee Who by no Mercy mollify'd wouldst be. 257 That Stroke will ram thee down into thy Death, Thy dear-earn'd Death of never-dying Pain; Where melted by my flaming eyes and breath, Thy thirty silver pieces I will drain Into thy heart; that thou mayst shriek and roar Whilst there they burn and boil for evermore. 258 This said; th'insulting Prince of Tyranny A while withdrew, and rested confident To see Maturity get wings, and fly To overtake his Plot: yet e'r he went, Seven times he thresh'd the Conscience with the flail Of his enormous poison-pointed tail. 259 As when the Deluge in the youth of Time Broke out upon the World, and with a Sea Of universal Wo surpriz'd the Crime Which dar'd just Vengeance's Severity; Those bold Delinquents saw their opened graves In Desperation first, then in the Waves: 260 So Judas taken in this mighty flood Of deepest Anguish, had no power of thinking Which way to scape, or that his Saviour's Blood Might drown that Sea in which he now was sinking. O no! the thought of that pure Blood alone Pour'd on his face Guilt's blushing Ocean. 261 Since more in Money he his Trust, than in His God had put; he dares not harbour hopes That Mercy now could reach his heightned Sin: A gap by fear to Impudence he opes; For by this wretched Dread of Goodness he Gives flat defiance to its Lenity. 262 Revenge he sees full aiming at his head, He sees his Treason flashing in his face, He sees the World's just Anger marshalled Against his odious Crime; hee sees the place Deep in the heart of Hell, where damned He Designed is for evermore to be. 263 With that, his cloths, his hair, his flesh he tore, He roar'd, he rav'd, and thus to Cursing fell: May that unhappy Day be read no more In any Calendars but those of Hell: Which to this baleful Life did me betray, A Life to living Death the dying way. 264 Curs'd be my Father, who a Brat begot The Heir to nothing but to Hate and Woe: And cursed be my Mother's womb, whose hot Pleasures at my Conception, only to Those hotter Pains prepar'd the path for me Who now in fire's deep womb conceiv'd must be. 265 Curs'd be those Paps, which nourish'd me, when my Young Innocence might happily, have dy'd: Curs'd be my tender Nurse, who feared by Sure Poison's courtesy, in death to hide Me from this deadlyer Night: and cursed be All sicknesses which would not murther me. 266 Curs'd be this Hand, which often ready had A Knife, and yet forbore my throat to cut: Curs'd be these feet, which often travelled Over the brows of Precipices, yet Would never stumble, that I might have fell Then but to Earth, who tumble now to Hell. 267 Curs'd be the Day, which first acquainted me With Jesus, and my ominous Name inroll'd Amongst his blessed Chaplains; Cursed be That Thirst of Wealth, by which my self I sold More sadly than my Master; Curs'd be all The gravely-wicked Chapmen, and the Sale. 268 Curs'd be this Garden; upon every bed May fatal Hemlock, Wolfbane, Poppy grow; May Adders, Basilisks, and Vipers feed Their poison here; on every Tree and Bough May winged Dragons perch, that something may Resemble Judas here another day. 269 Another Day! O no; may thickest Night Upon this Scene of Treason ever dwell; That neither Sun nor Star may reach their light More unto this, than to the other Hell. The bloody beams of Ghosts and fiends will glare With fittest lustre in this guilty Sphere. 270 But may the deepest of all Execrations On you my Thirty Silver Torments fall: What Vengeance shall requite those sweet Temptations Which thus have drown'd me in a Sea of Gall? Can I no way contrive, base paltry Clay, How I may you, as you did me, betray? 271 Down shall I hurry you with me to Hell, And hold you fast amidst my endless flames; Or kick you back into your former cell, The High-priest's Bag? this, this to Judas seems The blacker and the crueler Pit; and I Thither again will damn you instantly. 272 This said; like that tormented Man in whose Wild bosom reign'd a Legion of fiends, Himself to Salem in mad haste he throws, Where to the Temple he his passage rends; Not doubting but his Chapman he should find Against their God in his own House combin'd. 273 He found them there, and in among them ran, Flinging about his hand, his head, his eyes; And having strein'd his Ejulation To Horror's tune; my Crime, my Crime, he cries, Burns in my tortured breast, and domineers Too fiercely to be quenched by my tears. 274 No Expiation that Altar knows Which for my monstrous Guilt can satisfy: My Master's blood in such vast torrents flows On my unpardonable Soul, that I Am drown'd for ever in my deep Offence, Being condemned by his Innocence. 275 Take, take your Trash; and take my Curse with it: Hell's gulf devour your Souls. Here first on Them, Then on his Silver pieces having spit, He threw them at their hated heads; and from The Temple in wild indignation flung, Raving and cursing as he ran along. 276 For all the way he thought he strugled through An army of reviling Detestations: Over his head his arms this made him throw To shield it from his own Imaginations: Through which from heav'n and earth such arrows flew As wounded him at every step anew. 277 For Melancholy, dark as is the Pitch, Which on Avernus's throat so thick doth grow, Chok'd every glimpse of Sense and Reason which Offer'd to dawn in's bosom's orb, and show Him by what torturing Mistakes he had Himself unto himself a Tyrant made. 278 Dive Melancholy; which, (though sober she Whilst young and governable, gains the name Of Wisdom's Handmaid,) when Maturity Strengthens her gloomy poison, turns her tame Hypocrisy to headlong Madness, and All other Feinds in Fury doth transcend. 279 Thus came he to a silent secret place Without the Town, yet could not think it so; But fancied still that all the City was Hot in the chase of Him his Saviour's Foe. Each bird or fly that moved, made him start; Each Wind that puffed, blew quite through his heart. 280 His Eyes distracted were, 'twixt looking up For fear least Heav'n should fall upon his head; And down, least Earth her dreadful mouth should ope And snatch him to his grave e'r he were dead: Till with this Terror tir'd, his breast he stroke, And into right-down Desperation broke. 281 Adieu all Hopes, he cry'd, and Fears adieu; Come Vengeance come, my heart is ready here. Back to the Priests, I see, in vain, I threw That Money, whose sad burden still I bear; Still close and heavy sticks its Rust upon My gnawed Soul; and I must be undone. 282 If Heav'n be just, what means its Wrath's delay, Now it beholds my most-deserving head! Am I not Judas! did not I betray Its only Son? Is not my Conscience red With Jesu's spotless Blood? and yet can I Endured be to live, when He must die! 283 At least great Satan do not thou deny Thy Servant Pay for that grand Work, which he Hath compassed with matchless Villany, In high obedience to thy Feinds and Thee. What Soul e'r dared more than I have done, Or earn'd a gallanter Damnation? 284 Didst thou not nobly promise me but now The dearest Torments of thy deepest Jail? Deceive me not again: if ever thou Thy Credit tendredst, venture not to fail Thy trusty Judas; or ne'r hope to see Man serve thee more; if thou rewardst not Me. 285 Come then, burn up these Lips which learn'd of thee Their killing Kiss; Dash out these Brains which thou Taughtst how to plot, what now I dread to see; This Carkase in a thousand pieces throw, And empty out on every cursed Part The total rage of thy infernal Smart. 286 Take this despairing Soul, and let it be The Prey of thy immortal Furies: 'tis No groundless challenge; that, as due to me I claim the utmost of thy Spight; unless Thy Debt's infinitude thou hast forgot; Jesus and Heav'n into thine hands I put. 287 Jesus and Heav'n; whom I must ever hate, As having made them my eternal foes: O how I long to be in that Free State Where generous Blasphemy no bridle knows; Where I may Rage as loud's Heav'n's Thunders roar, And, being cursed, curse for evermore. 288 Here Fury's foaming Tide quite stopp'd his throat: Yet still he star'd, and struggled with his Grief; Still off he tore his hair, his breast he smote, And through Self-tortures hunted for Relief: His Tongue he bit because it would not speak, And stamp'd the Earth which would not open break. 289 He hideously grinn'd and gnash'd his teeth, With most importunate frenzy stung, to find The cruel dalliance of his wooed Death Which spar'd his Body whilst it slew his Mind: His sides he griped, and was mad to feel Hell in himself who long'd to be in Hell. 290 But as the sullen Fat, and Pitch, and Hair By Daniel cast into the Dragon's, throat, Burned, and roar'd and rag'd, and tumbled there More furiously than in the boiling Pot; Till with importunate swelling torments they Quite through his monstrous belly burst their way. 291 So flam'd this Lump of Horror and Despair In Judas's bosom, till so strong it grew That all his stretch'd and racked Entrails were Conquer'd with tortures, and in sunder flew: His Body split, and through that cruel wound Pour'd his more barbarous bowels on the ground. 292 Thus from this Prison his black Spirit ran Into as black a Jail, prepair'd for it Full in the center of Damnation; Where now it raves in chains at Satan's feet: Enforc'd the pois'nous flames he spews, to drink. O that all Traitors would of Judas think! END OF VOL. I. VOL. II. CANTO XII. The Banquet. The ARGUMENT. To seal his Dear Remembrance safe and sure Upon the hearts of his selected Sheep, Love institutes his Parting Feast, so pure And richly-sweet, that Psyche rap'd by deep Desire at his Description, sues to be A sharer in that Board's Felicity. 1 But ah! how large a Name is Treason, which Doth in another fatal chanel run, And from the Universe's Cradle reach Down to its funeral Pile: no Ocean E'r stretch'd its dangerous Arms so wide, or more Wrack'd Mortals flung upon its helpless shore. 2 Inbred Selftreason's this unnatural Feind Whose bus'ness 'tis to undermine her Home; Who musters up intestine Storms to rend Her too too loving Dame's unhappy Womb; Who on her Darlings joys her Spight to pour And whom she pampers most do's most devour. 3 Her title's Luxury; a rampant Weed Which grew at first in an unlikely place; Who would suspect that such a cursed Seed Should Paradise's blessed Beds disgrace? Yet, as the Serpent there presum'd to ly, So did this full as venomous Prodigy. 4 Too prying Eve first found her at the Tree Of Knowledge, and observ'd her clambring up With licorish zeal the dangerous Rarity Of that fair-fac'd forbidden Fruit to crop; Fool as she was, she help'd her climb the bough Not knowing that her self she headlong threw. 5 She knew not that her own wild Teeth would now Tear and devour her Innocence's Bliss; She knew not that this flattering Elf would draw Her to a forfeit of all Paradise, And having dress'd it in the beautious coat Of that gay Apple, thrust Death down her throat. 6 Yet She to Adam needs would her commend; Nor could unkindly-courteous He resist The huging of his Spouse's seeming Friend, Though Death and Hell it levell'd at his breast: And now all Eden's lawful Banquet is Too scant his wanton palate to suffice. 7 No; he must taste of that which never was Design'd thus to be ravish'd: But the sour Revengeful Fruit would brook no wrong, for as She stuck between his teeth, with all the power Of stupefaction them on edge she set, Proving his fretful Torment, not his Meat. 8 Nor could he chuse but leave his wretched Heirs Th'Inheritance of this inchanting Pain, Which down through all his Generations stayers Fail'd not its propagated Bane to drain: This hankering licorish Itch found way to run Hot through the veins of his remotest Son. 9 Which Fervor wax'd betimes so furious that The youthful World on fire with Lust it set; A fire which glow'd with Hell's rebellious heat; A fire which downward burnt, and being knit In league with other flaming Sins, grew stout, And found the Deluge work to quench it out. 10 Earth's face this having washed clean and white, On Heav'n she smiled with wel-pleasing grace; And God vouchafed Humane Appetite A full Commission over all the Race Of Beasts, of Fishes, and of Birds, to see How Man himself would bridle being Free. 11 For generous Spirits then will most abstain When Lords they are of their own Liberty; When Virtue is intrusted with the Rein, And room's allowed for Self-victory; When Moderation's Discipline may prove No Task of Duty, but a Strein of Love. 12 Man's Appetite to every thing was free, Except the Blood, where Life hath chose to swim: Blood's tincture's that in which stern Cruelty Dyes her bold Guilt: a tincture fit for grim And salvage Tigres; not for Man, who is, Or should, Professor be of Tenderness. 13 (Besides, whilst Men refrain their Lips from this Red Draught, their cheap Acknowledgement they make Of their most due Allegeance unto His Kind Majesty who pleased is to take (As little sure as they themselves could wish,) No homage but the Blood for all the flesh.) 14 Indeed good Noah, who both Worlds had seen, And was in holy Worth above them both, By watchful Temperance kept himself as clean As now the Earth was wash'd; and, that no Sloth Might tempt and steal him into Luxury, Buckled his bones to painful Husbandry. 15 Then, that the Sweat his Vinyard cost him, might In kind requited be, into his Glass The Grapes he shed: whose Look, though brisk and bright, Might well have been his Monitor: alas, Its ruby Dye had he but understood He would have shunn'd this Liquor too as Blood. 16 Yet when it smil'd and sparkled in his face, And mov'd with generous fervor in the cup, The unsuspitious Saint invited was With equal cheerfulness to drink it up. Vntryed Pleasures by their dainty skin And sweet behaviour, Approbation win. 17 The flattering Liquor as it downward went, Knock'd at his heart, and easy entrance got; Where with his Spirits it did compliment, And soft delicious fire amongst them shot: Noah rejoyc'd to feel his bosom glow, And his old Age's Ice begin to thaw. 18 This Bait drew down another: for, alas, Good Man he little dream'd that Treachery In his soul-cheering Cup infused was; Or that his Wine which sparkled, e'er would be Destructive flame: But from tame Embers rise Rampant Combustions when we least surmise. 19 By that Recruit the Liquor seconded, Awak'd its vigor, and grew proudly bold; Impatient to sneak below, it spred Through all the upper regions, and roll'd About his brains, wherein there 'gan to swim Such thickning clouds that Reason's Sun grew dim. 20 And then, infected with the pois'nous Sweet, He found no power left him to abstain: No more to quench his Thirst, but that new Heat Which burnt his veins, he takes his Bowl again; Which to the brim in heedless haste he fills, Then part on th'earth and part in's mouth he spills. 21 But now he Drunk no more, the Wine drunk Him, And swallow'd up both Man and Saint and all; (For thus, when in their own wild Draughts they swim, Our witty Tongue doth Drinkers Drunken call;) Which change so throughly did his head confound That Earth as well as Heav'n he thinks turns round. 22 And this is all he thinks of Earth or Heav'n, So shipwrack'd was his Soul in this red Sea; His Reason from its wonted helm was driven, His Fancy overwhelm'd, his Memory Away was washed, and the useless hulk Was only left him of his Bodie's bulk. 23 The Wine now sparkles in his eyes no less Than in his Bowl before: He gapes and stares On every thing, and yet he nothing sees; He trips and staggers, but no fall he fears, Nor feels it when he falls; for having let His Bowl drop down, himself sunk after it. 24 Thus he who in the universal flood Trampled the fury of the proudest Waves, And on the Ocean's back in triumph rode, Below him seeing all the Nations' graves; Alas, was drowned in a silly Cup Which he himself unwittingly drunk up. 25 No Ark above this Deluge Man can bear But Temperance, which here the Saint forgot; Who as he downward tumbled, took no care Of keeping on his modest Mantle; but As destitute of Cloths, as Senses lay, And did his double Nakedness display. 26 But as the Traitor who has slain the King Speeds from the Court as soon's the Mischief's done: So now the treacherous Liquor backward flung, And from the Murder it committed, ran: Besides, a rout of other Humors follow'd, And slaughter'd Noah in his Vomit wallow'd. 27 Slaughter'd indeed; and now a Man no more, For nothing was alive in him but Beast; Which spake its kind by his right swinish Roar: 'Till tir'd at length with yawning, and opprest With his most heavy self, he fell asleep, And in that nasty Rest his brains did steep. 28 Thus Luxury's first part in Eden grew, The second set in Noah's Garden was; By which kind Heav'n the warned World would shew That Danger's root can lurk in any place. Alas, the holyest Ground too often breeds As well as wholesom flowers, invenom'd Weeds. 29 God's Bounty granted all Variety Of Meats to feast the sober Appetite; And added brisk and cheerful Wine, to be The active soul of moderate Delight: Yet Man abusing his indulged Bliss, Deflour'd Heav'n's Grace by peevish Wantoness. 30 He neither would by Eve's Examples, nor By Noah's be advis'd, whose Sanctity Rendred them more invulnerable far Than common Mortals' feeble breasts can be: He still would dive, and rake the most profound Bottom of Pleasures, though himself he drown'd. 31 And from that bottom up he fetch'd at last Improved fat and full-grown Luxury; Who ne'r appeared to those Ages past So hideously-compleat a Prodigy; For she much cooler was and tamer then, And had not banish'd Men quite out of Men. 32 But an unruly Monster now she grew Incourag'd by the Vinyard's rampant flame; And round about the World in triumph flew, All which she wrack'd in her sweet-bitter stream: Stark raving she and roaring prov'd, and made All so, who practis'd her intemperate Trade. 33 The laws of God, of Man, of Nature were Vain feeble bridles, whensoever she Resolved in her furious carreer To let the Circle of her Healths run free: Oft has she brew'd with Wine's outragious flood Friends', Brothers', Parents', Masters', Princes' blood. 34 With firy spurs oft has she pricked on The neighing fury of her venery To Daughters', Sisters', Mothers' beds to run: Oft has she ventur'd by foul Blasphemy Upon the Virgin Heav'n's; and boldly mad, Committed, as she could, a rape on God. 35 Her Disposition's suted with a shape As odd and shapeless; for her parched Head Burns up all hopes of hair, and wastes the Sap By ill-bestow'd excess of moisture: Red With putrid fulness are her Eyes, and seem In her own overflowing Wine to swim. 36 But provident's her tumid Nose, for there The Wine is bottel'd up past running out; Which Bottle's lether being thin and clear Speaks what it holds; and studded round about With fervent Rubies, eminently shines Like grapes' large Bunches hung for Taverns' signs. 37 Wroth fiery knots are marshalled upon Her forehead and her cheeks: had Sicily Her Etna lost, this sulphury Region Would shew it her in multiplicity; For though these hills swell not so high as that, As great's their horror, and their smell as hot. 38 Her powting lips still dry and crannied are Though every day a thousand times too wet Alas her burning Breath which traffick'd there Makes them their supple commerce strait forget, And by the Poison of its fulsome stinks Taints all the aromatick Wines she drinks. 39 But by her Paunch's prominent Storehouse, great With child she seems of Mountains, for in this What all the World can yield of Drink and Meat In one prodigious Heap congested is: Here Solomon's twelve Oxen, and with them His mighty brasen Sea it self might swim. 40 This Sink is that where Surfeit being bred The fertile Parent of Diseases grows; Which she distributing from foot to head, All undigested Pleasures turns to Woes. Thus though the Bees delicious Honey bring, They always end in an invenom'd Sting. 41 Who knows not that Luxuriant Mortals eat The fuel of their final fate, and wrest The good intent of their abused Meat Not Nature but her Maladies to feast? Who knows not that in Health's deceitful Name They drink those Sparks which kindle fever's flame? 42 Themselves they diet thus with their own Death, And to a Weapon of Destruction turn The Staff of Life. In vain Heav'n's Mercy hath So bounteous been: if Men perversly learn Self-cruelty to find in it, and all Its Sweets adulterate into deadly Gall: 43 If Bacchus must be dubb'd a God, and have His larger and more constant Sacrifice, Than He who all their Vines to Mortals gave Whilst they the Giver by the Gift despise: If Ceres too a Goddess prove, and we All sworn Devotos of the Belly be. 44 Alas, and had not bold Mortality Commission large enough before, to check Our proudest Strength! Was all the Misery Of Famin, Plague, and War, so faint and weak That We, strange Voluntiers, our help must lend Of Luxury, to hasten on our End! 45 'Twas time, high time, for God himself to come, And with Heav'n's Balsam tame our desperate Wound; Our Madness swell'd so wide, that now no room For mortal Hand to give Relief was found. 'Twas time to come; and blessed be his Name, For, knowing Pity's cue, in time he came. 46 Jesus himself came down, and left the Feast Of all Delights which he above enjoy'd; Into the Depth of Poverty he cast His noble Life; and taught us to avoid Intemperance's baits, which Riches lay So fair and thick in Wantoness's way. 47 Then by his practick Abstinence he shew'd How eas'ly, fairly, and in open field Pernitious Luxury might be subdu'd, And healthful Temperance the scepter weild. Forty long days and nights at once he spent In Consecrating of his Servants' Lent. 48 His Doctrine He to His Example join'd When for His frequent Text He Fasting took, Proving those wilful Eyes much more than blind Which could discover in her solemn Look No richer Beauty than what smileth in The polish'd plumpness of a pamper'd skin. 49 'Tis true She's pale; so is the Lily too, So is her heav'nly daughter Chastity; So is the milk, so is the Virgin Snow: And yet when Modesty would dressed be In graceful Scarlat, she can raise a flood Of Purple, and shine fair in blushing Blood. 50 With costly Pride she seeks not to be deep Red in spruce Wines, strange Meats, and learned Sauce; She's not ambitious a tongue to keep More wise in Taste, than Speech; to hold a place Among quaint Kitchen-criticks; and to gain A more judicious Palate, than a Brain. 51 She is contented to be lank and lean, As one who counts it martial policy To keep her Ammunition close within Her less and therefore stronger Walls: for she Laughs at those plump and burly Gallants, who Can nothing but their swelling Out-works show. 52 But though her most contracted Ramparts need No numerous Garrison's incumbrance; yet This sober Mistress of all active Heed Her guard both day and night doth duly set, Being of treacherous Ease and Sleep afraid, By which fat lazy Bulwarks are betray'd. 53 She knows what Ballast will her bulk suffice To keep her steady in Life's dangerous Sea, And lays in but enough: the Marchandize Which fraughts her stowage, precious vertues be; And provident She, no bigger than her self, Securely sails by every Rock and Shelf. 54 Her Parts and Passions all their duties know, And she as little fears a storm within As from without: her flesh delights to bow To all commands; no Officers repine What course so e'r she steers, but all conspire To make their own still fail with her desire. 55 And thus she safely at that Port arriveth Which leads into the Continent of Bliss; The Port in which her dying Life surviveth, The blessed Key and Gate of Paradise: For whose incomparably-dainty fare With wise forecast she sav'd her stomack here. 56 This difficult but advantageous Grace Was that which Jesus strove on Earth to sow; But Earth so shamelesly-ingrateful was As to reject the noble Seed; for though Some few ingenuous Beds did entertain it, The most with peevish stubbornness disdain it. 57 Yea those who to the King of Abstinence Have sworn Allegiance, blush not to enroul Themselves the servants of Intemperance; And their licentious and revelling Bowl More sacred and obligatory count Than all the streams of Baptism's Heav'nly fount. 58 Else how comes that (O how unmanly) Trade Of daily turning Swine, to be profest With most applause, not where the Pagan shade Upon prevented Reason's eyes hath cast Blind Irreligion's Night; but where the Rays Of most revealed Heav'n gild Christian dayes? 59 Else how can'st thou, degenerous Britain, which Barr'st out all other Oceans by thy shore, To let the Sea of Drunkenness with such Unruly fury in thy bowels roar! O that thy feeble Sands should stronger be Than in thy Reason, or thy Piety! 60 How has this Deluge drown'd in Sottishness They once renowned Sense of Bravery; Since in thy gallant Sword's and Buckler's place A cowardly Succession we see Of Pots and Glasses, and (O Valour's shame!) Strong Drinker turned into Credit's name. 61 How come those Bacchanial Wars so dear In thy repute, who prid'st thy self that thou So well appointed art as not to fear Or Dutch or Danish bowls; but knowest how Both foes and friends by Grapes' mad blood to shed, And, though not strike, yet surely drink them dead. 62 How comes the Name of Cynick, or of Clown To blast their fame who never learn'd the Arts Of roaring Revels! how is Goodness grown No more by Virtue's Standard, but by Quarts And Pottles to be measur'd; whilst by Good Fellows, Carousers must be understood! 63 How comes this Mockery of Discipline, To drink in order and observe the Round! How comes Debauchery to defloure divine Solemnity, and sacred modes confound With swinish Rites; whilst Riot's Liturgy Devoutly is perform'd with Cap and Knee! 64 Why must it be in vain that Nature's care Hath tam'd thy Vines, and made them chaste and cool? Why must thy thirsty Lust rome far and near, And from all forreign Climates fill thy bowl? Such tedious voyages why dost thou take The whole World's Drunkenness thine own to make? 65 O how hast thou the sumptuous pains forgot Which mighty Love hath taken to requite The cost of Virtuous Abstinence; and what For Piety's untainted appetite His Bounties hand prepar'd; those dainties which Surmount all wishes' and all fancies' pitch. 66 At that high Banquet's strange magnificence Heav'n stands amazed: nor could Phylax now Longer conceal his brave ecstatick sense Of its dear Sweets: for Heav'nly bosoms glow So hot when Love's Exploits their wonder wake, That through their lips their flaming hearts must break. 67 The infamous Traitor's famous Story done: And Psyche having her short Supper eat; Her ardent Guardian thus again begun: My Dear, this Evening season, and the Meat Thy Spouse's providence hath given thee, Are Items of his greater Feast to Me. 68 He, Abstinence's noble Doctor, who Had taught his Servants not to clog their heart With corruptible viands; being now Already Sold, and shortly hence to part, A Banquet made so great and rich, as may More than the whole World's Temperance repay. 69 A Banquet not of gross and earthly chear Where birds, or beasts, or fish might convives be, But of immortal Dainties, Spirits' Fare, Diet of Souls; so pure, that only He The God in whom all Power and Sweetness live Could such celestial Entertainment give. 70 The solemn Day now summoned the Jews Their memorable Passover to eat: Nor would thine inoffensive Lord refuse With due respect that Feast to celebrate, Whose typick Office, like the faithful Shade On Him the Sun so long attended had. 71 With his Disciples down he sate; and from The consecrated and unblemish'd Lamb Observ'd the Copy of himself, in whom No Critick's searching eye found room for blame: Yet could not Innocence secure his life More than the Lamb it saved from the knife. 72 The Lamb devested of his fleece and skin The Fire's most hungry rage had naked fed, With its tormented patient flesh; and in This Lesson he his Pangs aforehand read, How to his Cross the Jewish fury tost him, And how the flaming Wrath of Heav'n did rost him. 73 The sad attendance of that bitter Sauce Which sourest Herbs about the Meat had thrown; The smart resemblance of that Anguish was With which his Dish of deepest Wo was strown: The stinking Weeds of humane Sins exceed In bitterness, all Herbs that Earth can breed. 74 The Haste which quickned on this transient Feast, Was not so winged, as the noble Speed With which He posted in desire to rest Upon the cruel Cross his tender head: A woful resting place was that, and yet To Love no Pillow seem'd so soft and sweet. 75 The Lamb he eat; and, though the Lamb of God, He meant himself as truly to be eaten. But that the strangeness of this mighty Food Might not appal his Guests; his Love do's sweeten Its own Conveyance by that dear Invention Whose depth exceeds created Comprehension. 76 For having finish'd this Solemnity And honorably brought it to its grave; He ushers in that precious Mystery, Kept for his final Favour, which might leave His precious Memory imprinted deep In all the souls of his beloved Sheep. 77 His combrous Mantle having laid aside, A Towel on he girds; for humble He Would not the least impediment abide Of most officious Activity: A Bacin then he fills, and at his own Poor servants' feet the mighty Lord falls down. 78 The conscience of his own eternal Worth, His boundless Power, and native Sovereingty; The clear remembrance of his coming forth From God's bright arms, and that he was to be There re-inthroned, could not hold him up; All this he knew, and yet He down did stoop. 79 Stoop then proud Mortals, whosoe'r you be Who have no power alone to stand: O stoop Now you behold your Sovereign on his knee, Whose Hand of all your Beings is the Prop: Stoop, since you see Him to his Scholars bow, And of the Highest make himself so low. 80 To stand on foolish terms of Honor now, Is but to found your glory on your shame: O, is't not more illustrious to bow With Jesus, than with Lucifer to aim Above your reach! why, why will Dust forget The place originally due to it! 81 But what's God's bus'nes at his Vassals' feet? Only to wash, and wipe them clean. O now Stoop lower still, lower and lower yet, For at the lowest you are not so low As He, the Universe's Monarch here Strangely become a servile Minister. 82 When Jesus thus with Water purged had His Servants' feet, and cleans'd with Grace their hearts; Shewing what Preparation must be made By all who hope to have their happy parts In his pure Banquet; down he sits again, With Miracles his Guests to entertain. 83 The Close of sumptuous Feasts is proud to be With choice and sovereign Delicacies crown'd, Which may the Convive's learned Luxury With deep and dainty Ravishment confound; And Jesus would not let this Supper want That costly point of princely Complement. 84 Indeed the Supper which They now had eat Its ready way into the Belly took; Where in the kitchen of poor mortal Meat Committed 'twas to active Heat to cook: And Heat's best skill could only dress it fit To feed the Body which had fed on it. 85 But Christ's adorable Design was now With such a second Course to grace the Board, As might to pined Minds relief allow, And nutriment to hungry Hearts afford; Such Nutriment as sprightful strength might give To all his Guests eternally to live. 86 In his Almighty Hand he took the Bread, And his Magnifick Blessing pour'd on it; Bate but his own, and ne'r on any Head Such potent Benediction chose to sit: Indeed, it was that Blessing's echo, and Bounded upon his Body in his Hand. 87 For breaking that dear Bread, He tender'd it To his Disciples, saying, Take and eat; This is my Body broke for you: and let My Death's Remembrance live in this your Meat. But Jesu's Feast must not a dry one be; His Wine shall match his Meat's high rarity. 88 He takes the Cup, and cries, Drink all of this, My Blood, the Blood of my New Testament, Which shed, and liberally bequeathed is To wash the Sins of all that will repent. As oft as of this Fount of Life you Drink, Of Me, your bountiful Redeemer, think. 89 Sweet Jesu! O how can thy World forget Their Royal Savior, and his Bounty; who Upon his Tables his own Self hath set; Who in their Holy Goblets deigns to flow, And in their Dishes lie. Did ever Friend So sure a Token of his Love commend? 90 Infallibly there dost Thou flow and lie; Though mortal eyes discover no such things, Quick-sighted Faith reads all the Mystery, And humble pious Souls know how to bring Into the Wonder's Cabinet, and there Make all the Jewels of this Truth appear. 91 She generously dares on God rely, And trust his Word, though up in Riddles knit: If Jesus once pronounceth, This is my Body and Blood: Far, far, cries she, be it That I should think my dying Lord would cheat Me in his Legacy of Drink and Meat. 92 His Word's omnipotent: by Saying, He Effects whate'r he says; and more than I Or can, or would conceive. What is't to me If He transcends Man's low Capacity? Surely it well becomes Him so to do; Nor were He God, if He could not do so. 93 Let Him say what He will, I must deny Him to be God, or certain hold his Word: Me it concerneth not, to verify What He proclaims: My duty's to afford Meek credit, and let Him alone to make Good, whatsoever He is pleas'd to speak. 94 Good He can make it; witness Heav'n and Earth, Yea, ev'n Themselves who thus his Words distrust: For from what fount flow'd this Creation forth, But his Almighty Lips? Needs therefore must His Words be real, or the World's vast Mass Must for a Dream and vain Delusion pass. 95 Gross and unworthy Spirits sure they be, Who of their Lord such mean conceptions frame, That parting from his dearest Consorts, He No token of his Love bequeath'd to them But simple Bread and Wine: a likely thing, And suting well Magnificence's King. 96 A likely thing, that when the lusty Blood Of Bulls and Goats can wash no Sins away, The Blood of Grapes should with a stronger Flood Quite overwhelm and drown the World's Decay: O no, such virtue in no Blood can dwell, But that which through the Veins of God did thrill. 97 Ask me not then, How can the thing be done, What power of Sense or Reason can digest it? Fools, as you are, what Demonstration So evident as this, My God profest it? And if you prove it true, that He can lye, This Wonder, and Him too, I'll strait deny. 98 But first demonstrate, how one single Sound Can to the Circle's brims its self impart, And on a thousand Ears at once rebound In its compleat totallity: your Art Alas, is puzell'd here: and every Noise Chides your distrust of your Redeemer's Voice. 99 Speak out, fond Infidelity, speak out, And say, This single Sound is more than One: Or, if shame stops thy Mouth: why is thy Doubt So shameless as to make Great Him alone Who is th'Eternal Word, that power want, Which to each flitting Voice thy Faith doth grant. 100 But what thanks were't, if you could credit what To Sense and Reason's eye were written plain? Heav'n's much to them beholden, who will not Believe it higher is than they can strain; Who jealous are of God, and will not be Induc'd to trust Him further than they see. 101 And yet had you these modest Eyes of mine, You in this gloomy Cloud would see the Sun; That Sun, who in wise justice scorns to shine On those who with bold prying press upon His secret Majesty; which plainly I Because I make no anxious search, descry. 102 This is the Valorous Resolution Of gallant Faith: the blessed Rule whereby All those through Mysterie's meanders run, Who are the Scholars of Humility. Yet must I tell thee, Psyche, itching Pride Will not hereafter thus be satisfy'd. 103 A thousand waspish Syllogisms will Be buzzing from the mouths of those who build Their groundworks of Religion on the skill With which they proudly think their brains are fill'd; 'Till Queries, Doubts, Distinctions, Niceties Breed fretful Schisms, and pois'nous Heresies. 104 Needs will they peep into the Manner how This hidden Miracle to pass was brought; And madly being not content to know What Christ thought fit to teach them, study out They know not what, and make this Banquet prove A Sacrament of War and not of Love. 105 Some press too near, and spy what is not there, Some carelessly take what is there away: Some will admit no Miracle, for fear That Consequent be usher'd in, which they Resolve to stop; and that their Faith should be Forc'd to confess more than their eyes can see. 106 Some first Conclude, and afterward Dispute, Loth to confess they did Define in haste: Some rest contented only to confute What others urge: nor can the mighty Feast Perswade their sceptick Stomachs to sit down, And by meek Faith make Angels' Cheer their own. 107 Some sift Existence, Substance, Accidents, Concomitance, through Logick's busy sive: Trans, Sub, and Con, by strange experiments They boult so long, that they themselves deceive: For whilst to win the precious Flower they strain, The course and refuse Bran is all they gain. 108 When Aristotle's Laws are urg'd to be The Umpiers in Religion, the Rent Poor Art would fain sew up in Piety, Is mended but by further Detriment: For by th'unworthy clownish Needle, it Both multiply'd, and wider ope is set. 109 O happy World, if all would once agree In that which Jesus did so plainly teach! If those short Words no more might tenter'd be By long Disputes beyond themselves to reach: If they to apprehend their sense, would strain Their faithful Heart, and not their doubtful Brain: 110 If they their Notions and themselves would cease To rack and torture; and to make their great And burly Volumes swell with Witnesses Of their profound and learned Want of Wit: If for the Manner they would trust their Lord, And for the Substance take Him at his Word. 111 For Heav'n its faithful wheel shall sooner turn And backward hale the Sun into the East; The Polar Bear in Lybia's furnace burn; And Sirius's mouth be sealed up with frost; Into the lofty Spheres dull Tellus leap And headlong tumble Height into the Deep; 112 Than any Syllable which droppeth from The lips of Jesus, can be born away Upon the Wind's swift wings, and never come Back with its full Effect: however They Whom Wit befools, will be so mad in this Clear point, as to dispute away their Bliss. 113 In vain it is to tell these Wranglers, how Jesus could graft cold Stones into the Stock Of Abraham, and make dead Pebles grow Fresh lively Jews: or that he did not mock His stomach by the Bread he daily eat, But to his Fleshe's substance turn'd his meat. 114 In vain to tell them, how, into his Blood The Wine he drank was truly chang'd; for though. Such speculations pois'd and understood With reverent heed, might help the soul to row In this deep Wonder's sea: yet Wranglers will, Because they will be so, be Wranglers still. 115 But as the strictest siege of Thorns is laid To goodly Roses; whilst the vulgar flowers, Not worth the choking, never grow afraid Of armed neighbours, whose infestive powers Might plant their bane about them: so it fares With this rich Bread invaded by the Tares. 116 What heart can of the monstrous Gnosticks think And not abhor their damned Sacrifice; The matchless and the most blasphemous sink Of Earth's and Hell's profound Impieties! Thine ears were never frighted with so black A Sin, as they their grand Religion make. 117 But I in reverence to thy Blush forbear That deep Abomination's Den to rake, Whose rank Sent reaks as high's the highest sphere And in God's nostrils stinks: yet leave must take To tell thee thine own Albion will at last Contempt on this most glorious Banquet cast. 118 For in the dregs of Time; when Wealth and Pride Have fatned British hearts fit to defy All sacred Discipline, and to the Tide Of furious Licence, and wild Ataxy Flung ope the gap; unhallow'd Hands will dare From holy Priests this reverend Work to tear. 119 Mechanick Zeal, inspir'd by Sottishness, And by enthusiastick Ordination Of self-deluded Fancy Call'd to dress God's Feast in Man's reformed misshapen fashion; Will purest Purity it self defile, And by Heav'n's gate find out a way to Hell. 120 But happy Thou who shalt not live to see Thine eyes tormented with that cursed sight, Which acted shall and authorized be By equal Sons of everlasting Night. Come then let our Discourse return, and be Attendant on the Board of Sanctity. 121 Thy Lord's great Banquet was the Consummation Of Israel's famous Passover; and did With mystick power antidate His Passion, And that long-long'd-for Word, 'Tis finished. Right noble was that typick Passover, But nobler this, because substantial, here. 122 How much more precious is this Lamb; who though This Feast of Dainties to Himself be sour, Presents no sauce of bitter herbs to gnaw His Convive's taste; but with the plenal power Of Sweetness entertains their Palates, and Pozes their Wits their Bliss to understand. 123 This is that more renown'd Viaticum The Israel of God to fortify When they from Pharaoh's iron Bondage, home Are hastning to their holy Liberty. O Psyche, those dim Stories clearlyer are Reacted in the Christian hemisphere. 124 Sin, Sin, that hateful Egypt is, where reigns A King more stern than Pharoh's fiercest rage; The Tyrant Belzebub, who throws his chains About the World, its shoulders to engage Under a more unreasonable Law Than making brick whilst 'tis denyed straw. 125 But pious Souls are by this Paschal Feast With holy vigour so embrav'd, that they This servile yoke from off their necks can cast, And into Rest's free region snatch their way; Although their hard obstructed passage be Both through the dismal Desert and the Sea. 126 This enigmatick Life of Misery, Can own both those repugnant Names: what are Its Storms, and Broils, and Tumults, but a Sea Red with Destruction? what's a Theatre Lin'd thick with salvage and enraged Foes, If not a dreadful Wilderness of Woes? 127 But through this wretched Desert, and this Sea, The virtue of this Passover will lead Believing Souls, till they securely be In blessed Canaan established; That Canaan whose Milk and Honey is The Sweetness of exuberant Paradise. 128 That Canaan whose Inhabitants shall not Through nine and forty Orbs of Slavery Be forc'd to climb to one of Freedom, but Find every year a constant Jubile; In which, although they never sow or reap, They still an everlasting Feast shall keep. 129 That Canaan, where no Jebusits shall run Thorns through the sides of its accomplish'd Rest; And whence no Babylonish Army can E'r hope the happy Colonies to thrust: A Canaan which alone makes good the grand And glorious Title of the Holy Land. 130 This Sacramental Bread, and this alone, Is that supporting Staff of Life, with which The stoutly-faithful Generation Their gallant journey take to heav'n, and reach The top of their Desires more surely far Than by his Staff the Artist do's the Star. 131 By Bread, and bread alone, Man now must live, This Bread which from God's mouth on purpose came; Christ's potent Institution did derive This virtue to it; and Himself to them Who pant for Life, proclaim'd the way to get That noble Prize was by this only Meat. 132 All Delicacies moulded up in one Pure precious Composition flourish here: No Sybarit's Invention e'r upon Their Board's fat Altars sacrific'd such Cheer To their dear Bellies, though of all their Rout Of Gods, their Paunches they the highest thought. 133 The Syracusian Tables never sweat Under such Dainties: Alexandrian Feasts Could never with such princely sprightful Meat Ravish the palates of their pamper'd guests: No Asiatick, nor no Medick fare, No Cates of Marsel's might with these compare. 134 Great Solomon's profoundest Industry, Which through all Nature did his Pleasures hunt, Sifting and boulting every Suavity To find the fugitive Soul of true Content, Nought but unsavory Vanity could taste; All solid Pleasures here alone are plac't. 135 Here, in this sacred close Conspiracy Of most substantial Delights; to which That high Angelick Cheer which studiously Heav'n's bounteous hand did every morning reach To His dear Jacob's pilgrim hungry Seed, Resigns its fame and seems course homely Bread. 136 O Nest of fledgest Joies! O sacred Mine Of richest Sweetnesses! O fertile Tree Of Life's own Life! O mighty Magazine Of ever-nutritive Felicity! O Bread of Wonders, who thy praise can tell Which God Himself dost render Edible! 137 Nor is the Dainties of the Cup less rich Than that which in the noble Patin lies: The Wine of Love, of Life, of Spirits, which By new unheard-of entheous properties So strangely human Hearts imbraves, that they In Fear's most frightful looks read no Dismay. 138 Heav'n's prudent Law took warey order that No creature's Blood the lip of Man should stain: And just and useful was the Caution; that All pious mouths might be reserved clean In reverence to the Blood of this pure Lamb Design'd into believing Lips to stream. 139 O blessed, bloody, peaceful Wine! O how Divinely hast thou satisfaction made For those enflaming Poisons, sweets which flow In other Wines! may Noah now be glad Of his Invention, since his foul Mishap Is clean wash'd out by this al-purging Grape. 140 This Wine is that wherein dwells Verity, The Verity of Heav'n: for Heav'n in it All melted is: those boundless Joies which We Bath'd in at home, are here together met In strange epitomy, and smiling swim About the Chalice's soul-charming brim. 141 To Venus's milk let shameless Luxury Turn other Wines, and to its swelling Cups As to the bottles of her bosom fly, Whence only furious Uncleanness drops; This is a purer Juice than can be prest From Chastity's own most unspotted breast: 142 Of this mild Doves may drink, and never fear That any Inflammation will intrench Upon their sober blood: white Virgins here Their shie and bashful hearts may safely drench: This Liquor breeds no flames but soft and cool, Which though they burn, cannot infect the soul. 143 One Drop of this, though it can amply fill The most immeasurable Thirst's desire With more than any wish can covet; still It raises that fulfilled Longing higher, And makes in vastest Satisfaction's tide The overflowing heart unsatisfy'd. 144 Should Greek, Canary, or Pannonian Wine, Should Spanish, French, Italian, and the rest Which crown the chalices of Kings, combine In one Extraction, sumptuously drest With aromatick helps; they would be all If parallell'd with this, but costly Gall. 145 Proud Cleopatra's prodigalest Bowl Where her luxuriant Jewel learn'd to swim, And its inestimable riches roll Melted and mixed with the gallant stream; Compared with this Cup, was full as vile As any bottle filled at her Nile. 146 This Wine makes those all blush for their own shame Which in great Belteshazzer's goblets smil'd; Which Olofernes to the beauteous Dame, And yet more masculine than beauteous, fill'd: That Dame, who in her Nation's quarrel durst Quench with his Blood more than his Wine, her thirst. 147 Sardanapalus nor with cost or care Such precious Liquor ever could obtain: No Epicurean ambition e'r Its liquorish self screw'd to so high a strein As to affect a Draught so rich as this: No: fancie's utmost reach here posed is. 148 Where other Grapes' outrageous Powers reign, Both Sence and Reason rue that tyranny; Which being drown'd together with their Brain, Strait every captiv'd Part and Faculty To beastly Madness is enslav'd, and flies On murders, rapines, rapes, and Villanies. 149 But where this Wine of Angels domineers, The heart with noble Drunkenness it fills; The conquer'd spirits it sweetly overbears With charming streams of mystick Miracles; Till quite intoxicated by this Flood Of Love and Heav'n, the Man is drunk with God. 150 Strange, Psyche, are this Drunkennesse's fits; Oft have I seen, and them as oft admir'd: The world esteem'd them fir'd out of their wits Whom with this Liquor's flame it saw inspir'd: But we know what ecstatick Raptures mean, And Zeal's Exploits whene'r it gets the Rein. 151 Oft have I seen brave Spirits, when they rose From this great Banquet fill'd with generous Rage, Fly in the face of Vice; and nobly choose Against its stoutest Ramparts to engage Their heav'nly Confidence; nor has their high Adventure fail'd to reach down Victory. 152 Oft have I seen them smile in sweet disdain Upon Misfortune's most insulting Look: Oft have I seen them kindly entertain Those guests' faint humane Nature worst can brook, Grief, Sickness, Loss, Oppression, Calumny, Shame, Plunder, Banishment, and Poverty. 153 Oft have I seen them scorn the frown of Death, On Crosses laugh, most sweetly hug the bitter Salutes of Swords, and spend their final breath In wooing greatest Tortures to be greater: Oft have I seen them enter single fight Both with the Peers, and with the Prince of Night. 154 For knowing well what strength they have within, By stiff tenacious Faith they hold it fast. How can those Champions ever fail to win, Who cap-a-pe, for Arms, with Heav'n are drest! Those Breasts must needs all Batteries defy, Where God Himself in garrison doth lie. 155 But to augment the wonder, Psyche, this Great Feast of Feasts can never all be spent: When Millions it has fill'd, intirely 'tis The same it was, and knows no detriment. So though the World all drinks in Air, yet still The undiminish'd Region is full. 156 And yet not so: for here each Soul doth eat The total Banquet, and yet leaves it whole: These antecedent Ages cannot cheat Those which lag on behind: whilst Heav'n shall roll, And Earth stand still, this ever-teeming Board The same Delights will unto All afford. 157 No fount lives on such living Springs as dwell In this pure Cup of Life, to which though all Nations and Tongues flock in to drink, it still Maintains its equal Plenitude; nor shall The busy School, with all its endless fry Of Doubts and Queries hope to draw it dry. 158 Though all Heav'n's starry Tapers lighted be At Phebus's eyes, his Raies keep still intire: His Image shines in every Lake and Sea, Yet only One is his original fire; Which doth its wondrous single self so wide In its compleat Similitude divide. 159 Thus, but more really thus, this feast Most absolutely One is wholly spread Into the mouth and heart of every Guest; And fails not there more Heav'nly beams to shed, Than when the Sun by his meridian Ray Triumphs upon the highest throne of Day. 160 Thy most profoundly-gracious Lord, who far Above the reach of any Want did reign, Descended from His mighty Glorie's sphere; And that His voyage might be sure to gain Him Emptiness' fulness, lowly He To prove the poorer, woul'd a Borrower be. 161 For hither on this strange Adventure come, He borrow'd of the World Humanity, And in the Cabinet of Mary's Womb Dress'd up Himself compleatly Man; yet He Though by this Condescent new raies He set In Nature's crown, still thought Himself in debt. 162 And pay He would, right generous as He was, All back again which He had borrow'd here; He meant His Blood and Body on the Cross To tender, and make full requital there To His unwitting Creditors, and that With Interest which Numbers cannot rate. 163 And yet because His Human Nature He So dearly loves, that He concludes to bear It home in triumph, and eternally Those narrow Robes of bondless Mercy wear; E'r He His journy took, He plotted how It might Ascend and yet Remain below. 164 Remain below, to be Restor'd, and that As oft as human Mouths would take it in: And this th'Invention was, this Wine and Meat, By which His mystick power to all His Kin Repays His Flesh and Blood, that Man might eat And drink, and with his God Incorporate. 165 For, His excessive favour to complete Beyond the stretch of any Parallel, This noble Pay is so improved, that His Godhead's vastness too concurs to swell The royal Feast; since this can never be Dissevered from His Humanity. 166 O boundless little All! O Banquet which Must feed Astonishment for evermore, Whilst largest Souls their intellectual reach Tenter in vain, and find it still too poor To equal thy extent, ev'n when thine own Fulness they have receiv'd and swallow'd down. 167 O Banquet! fit for His magnificence Whom might and goodness own for Sovereign. By this dear Project, Psyche, Mercy's Prince Collecteth in His more than golden Chain His World unto Himself, and ties it close That no Disunion may interpose. 168 The glorious Incarnation began To knit this knot; which now redoubled is: There God vouchaf'd to join Himself to Man, Here Man has leave to make the juncture his, And weave himself with his Redeemer. O What God e'r stooped to his Creature so! 169 By this sweet Combination Mortals grow Forgetful of their Singularities, Their thwarting Interests, their I and Thou, Their Mine and Thine, their grounds of Avarice Of Envy, of Ambition, and comply In holy Peace's common Unity. 170 This Cement's power doth mystically wed The Stones which raise Ecclesia's Edifice; This Ligature the Members to their Head Symmetriously links; the sheep by this Though spread through all Earth's pastures far and near, One perfect Total with their shepherd are. 171 For as the active Soul, although she swim Intirely one through all the Body; still In every Member and in every Lim In her Totality doth single dwell: So by this Sacramental Union Jesus is One to All, and All to One. 172 Believe it Psyche, though thy mortal Eye Spies no such brave Attendance on this Board, Yet thick those Waiters stand whose Dignity Shines next the glories of their royal Lord: No prince's Coronation Pomp was e'r Aggrandiz'd by such servitors as here. 173 Here Legions of the Heav'nly Army keep The guard of Reverence; round this Mercy-seat Not two, but thousand Gallant Cherubs peep With ravishment on what you drink and eat; Here stately Principalities attend, Here Thrones bow down, and here Dominions bend. 174 For when they perched were in their own sphere, The glorious Ocean of eternal Sweets, Their blessed eyes beheld no richer Cheer Than Mercy on this noble Table sets: Nor could that Troop which kept the avenue To Paradise such precious Dainties shew. 175 Pure is their sight, and sprightfully can pass Quite through that Vail, which on this Banquet lies; A Vail which in profound compassion was Thrown on the count'nance of these Mysteries; Which dart more glories from their naked Face, Than ever did great Moses's Temples grace. 176 Yea, ev'n his Eyes, though sublimated by His long converse with flaming Wonders, yet Mov'd in too low an Orb to reach the high Looks of his Maker; and were only fit To read those secondary Beams which make His Rear, and meekly wait upon his back. 177 So long as mortal Grossness sticks upon The brows of Man, and clogs his feeble sight, One glimpse of Heav'nly Majesty alone Would seal his eyes up with eternal Night. For what exceeds the sense, the same destroys: No pitch is darker than transcendent Rays. 178 When Bats may venture to the Eagle's nest, And their faint eyes against fair Titan's set; When purblind Owls may leave their gloomy roost, And with safe looks the face of High-noon meet; When Midnight dares throw off her sable cloak, And into bright Aurora's wardrobe look; 179 Then may dim-sighted Men securely gaze Upon their Lord's unvailed Brightness; then May they directly to His royal Face Without a Perspective's assistance run; Then may they boldly scorn their eyes to shroud Under the shadowing court'sy of a Cloud. 180 But Jesus, who full well their weakness knew, Would in the shelter of plain Wine and Bread Accommodate His Goodness to their view; That in familiar Elements they might read The hidden Mystery, and happier be Than their dust-damped mortal eyes could see. 181 The time shall come when that dull Dust shall by The quick brisk virtue of the Resurrection, Refined be to a capacity Of radiant and spiritual perfection; When faithful Souls in their celestial rest Shall at the Lamb's unmasked Supper Feast. 182 Mean while, it is their privilege that they The Day can kiss in darkness; that the Sun They freely in the shadow may enjoy; And in Hope's Region meet Fruition. But who would dream that peevish Man from hence Should pick bold Reason of Irreverence! 183 Alas, when Time shall old and doting grow, And Christian Spirits sympathize with it, Men will not blush to make this Banquet know That by its Out-side they will square, and fit Their wary Faith, which further must not venture Than blunt and feeble Sense's edge can enter. 184 Rank Superstition 'tis presum'd, if they Esteem God's Table holier than their own; If to this Chalice more respect they pay Than to those Cups which all the jolly Town Toss in the publick Inns, whene'r they keep Their free Communion of Good-fellowship. 185 If they but bow the Head, or bend the Knee, Or let their humbled Bodies comment on Their lowly Minds; if they but dare to be Professors of good Manners; if they shun But that which Love and Gratitude abhors, They must be voted flat Idolaters. 186 Nor Jove, nor Juno, nor the silliest He Or She of all that rabble, wildly made Gods by vain Man; found such impiety In their mad Makers, as to be betray'd To slovenish Altars, and to clownish Rites, By fained Zeal's irreverent Deceits. 187 On Jesus and his Noblest Mystery, Must Rudeness only be allow'd to wait? Zealous and pure must this Religion be, Because most gross and lazy? surely, great Is our Mistake in Heav'n, who alway there Our lowliest Service to our God prefer. 188 Is this the Thanks for bridling in his flames Of most intolerable Majesty; Which once unrein'd, by its immortal Streams Would them destroy, and all their slovenry! Alas, that Love should thus neglected be, And for no cause, but Mighty Charity. 189 Are these the Tribe of Saints, who boast that they Possessed are of Faith's Monopoly? Ah, dead and rotten Faith, which can display No fruit to prove the Root's vivacity! 'Tis vain to dream a faithful Soul can dwell In any Body that is Infidel. 190 But those brave Lovers, of whose generous Breasts, Jesus intire possession holds; are so Inamor'd of this Soul-attracting Feast, That they with all the art of Reverence to Its Board approach, and make their meek desire After Angelick Compliments aspire. 191 Their Hearts beat high with that illustrious Zeal, Which fires our Breasts, and fain would stoop as low As Seraphs do, whene'r this Miracle Of Love invites their reverent Knees to bow: Fain would their panting passionate Piety Be infinite, as is this Mystery. 192 For infinite it is: and O that I Could that Infinitude before thee set! No Theme could raise with such exultance my Applauding Tongue: But Angels must submit To Ecstasies in such vast deeps as this, Where Love himself reigns in his own Abyss. 193 Here Phylax ended; and observed how The Bait would relish he so fairly cast To Psyche's Soul: which being captiv'd now By his Discourse's potent Charms, and fast Chain'd to the vunerable Table's foot; This yielding Answer gently forth she brought; 194 My Soul's sweet Friend, what equal thanks can I Pay for this Honey which thy tongue hath shed Upon my Ears and Heart! May He, whom thy Sublime Elogium honor'd, crown thy Head With full Requital: as for simple Me, What can the Worm, poor Psyche, give to thee? 195 All she can give is but the Begger's Dole, Occasion of thy further favors: yet No earthly cates I crave: O no! my Soul, In spight of Famine's power, dares forget All other food, if at this royal Feast Of Heav'n and Love I now may be a guest. 196 And if I be not so, I am undone! Such hunger gnaws, such thirst do's burn my Heart, That by this Banquet's Comforts I alone Can rescu'd be from my impatient smart, And 'tis thy courteous fault, dear, Phylax, who With its Description me hast ravish'd so. 197 The sickly, what but Health can satisfy? And what Balsam can the Answer be Unto the Wound's wide mouth, and bloody cry? What pants the heated hunted Hart to see But some cool Fount, or sovereign Ditany? What cures the Captive's grief but Liberty? 198 My Health, my Balsam, and my Liberty, My dear Dictamnum, and my Fount of Bliss, My only Nectar, and Ambrosia lie In Jesu's Cup and Patin: if I miss Of this my Hunger's necessary aim, Psyche, a farewel must to Hopes proclaim. 199 She fainted here. But strait her Guardian's hand Snatching her arm, thrust comfort through her Heart. I like, cry'd he, thy noble Ardor, and Its fuel will to this thy fire impart. In yonder House there lives a reverend Priest, Who for thy pious Soul will dress this Feast. 200 This said, he leads the Virgin thither: where Close in a Vault a knot of faithful Hearts For that great Bus'ness early did prepare: For Pagan Tyranny wak'd all their Arts Of Privacy, and made Devotion choose Such Temples as might hide them from their Foes. 201 There in a simple Dish and Cup of wood, The furniture of Primitive poverty, The Wonder of their Savior's Flesh and Blood, With golden Hearts they waited on: but we Alas, in Patins and in Bowls of Plate, With Hearts of wood this Banquet celebrate. 202 They in the Stranger's zeal-inflamed Eye Such genuine beams of Piety descry'd, As soon dispell'd their mists of jealousy At her Intrusion; unknown, untry'd, She welcome was: besides, the holy Priest By Heav'n was warn'd to entertain this Guest. 203 Phylax withdrew his nimble self into His closet of Invisibility, And there attended on his Psyche; who With such brave fervor to the Mystery Made her approaches, that her hungry Haste Copy'd the boundless greatness of the Feast. 204 So when th'Olympick Runner draweth nigh The noble Goal, and sees the naked Prize Incouraging his panting Ardency; First he devours with his greedy Eyes, Then with his thirstier Thoughts; and as he may Reaches the End, though yet but in the way. 205 O how her Soul into the Patin leap'd, And dived to the bottom of the Cup! With what Inamorations she weep'd! What sighs of joy did break her Bosom ope! How struggled Fear with Love! how did she groan Between Humility and Ambition! 206 O how she thinks her Lips and Heart impure! And yet she cannot for a world refrain: For how shall she her useless Life endure, If from the Life of Life she must contain! How can her Iron linger and forbear To meet the Loadstone now it is so near! 207 So near; that she sees nothing else but that; Not one of all those numerous Convives who About her kneel'd: Nay she has quite forgot The thought of her most precious Phylax too, And of her self, who Psyche is no longer; She's nothing now but holy Thirst and Hunger. 208 Whilst in this dainty agony she lay, Into her Mouth the Priest her Wishes brings; Which to her Heart directly took their way, And there pour'd out ten thousand ravishing Things: By which strange Deluge her dear hopes were driven Into Fruition's gulph, and drown'd in Heav'n. 209 O most miraculous Feast! how fain my Song Would be luxuriant in admiring thee. But not my low, nor Phylax his high Tongue Knows how to reach that lofty Harmony Of Joys and Pleasures, which united lie In bounteous Love's profoundest Mystery. 210 Yet may my pin'd and pained Spirit lay At this Song's foot her just and heavy sighs; Which, never since mine Eyes first op'd on day, So deeply relished Life's miseries: The more my shame, whose active sins for me, Have earned this Heart-gnawing malady. 211 Time was when Heav'n in this late happy Isle Kept open house; when this celestial Feast Did freely wooe all Souls to come and fill Their appetite's ambition with the best Of antidated Bliss, and grow divine By this spiritual mighty Bread and Wine. 212 But now both Feast and Board devoured are By strange new Banquets, as jejune and dry As barren Air: for all this Pulpit Cheer Feeds but the itching Ear's fond Boulimy Whilst still the Heart remaineth lank and thin, And nothing fatter grows but lusty Sin. 213 (Thus when the meager Skeletons of Cattle Array'd themselves upon the banks of Nile; They bad the goodly well-flesh'd Oxen battle And gormandiz'd their Preys; yet could not fill Their wretched skins, but pin'd and proved more Ill-favour'd shrivell'd Monsters than before.) 214 Sin fatter grows; so fat that now it dares Kick both at Earth and Heav'n, and scorns to be Aw'd by those generous and ingenuous Fears Which hold the reins of virtuous Modesty; It mocketh Vengeance, and derideth Law, Because their patient Sword they slowly draw. 215 Witness that Sacrilege, that Fury, and That impudently-made Profaneness, which Tears down the Church with Reformation's hand, And robs its God the surer to be rich: Which scorns Religion for Religion's sake, And Offrings to it self doth Altars make. 216 Witness those numerous Spawns of shameless Lyes, Which with heretick insultation tread On Sacred Truth, and make her patronize Her own Contempt; whilst shamelesly they plead Th'authority of God Himself, and on His Spirit all their Carnal Fancies pin. 217 Doctrine and Use with empty Noise ingross The gulled Auditors; and there's an end. Out runs this sleight Religion with the Glass, And well is measur'd by the fruitless Sand. Here no Excuse's help can intervene; Alas, the Doctrine by the Use is seen. 218 O how come Christian Souls so well content To want the choisest Viands Heav'n could give! O how preposterously abstinent Are they who with all riotous Dainties strive To fortify the Belly, but can find No time to victual and recruit the mind! 219 More provident those Heros surely were Upon whose nearer hearts the warmer Blood Of Jesus drop'd: not once a month, or year, They their Devotion cheer'd with Angels' Food, But duly every morn this Table spread, And made the Lord of life their daily Bread. 220 They next their hearts no other Morning Draught Would take; but what suits with the heart indeed. The bottles of their souls betimes they brought, And at this living Fount replinished Their brave Desires; whose thirst did swell so high That nought could quench it but Immensity. 221 With sprightful zeal this kept their bosoms warm, This made them eagle-like their strength renew; With death-despising Courage this did arm Their gentlest Spirits; by this they Masters grew Of earth and hell, which having trampled down, Heav'n too by violence they made their own. 222 So ne'r can they who feed on preached Wind, Which vainly bubbles in their wanton ear; And tympanizeth so their cheated Mind, That they too big and burley grow to wear Christ's humble Livery, or enter at Supreme vast Bliss's low and narrow Gate. 223 But O my Heart, why art thou stealing thus From thine own woes, thy Neighbours to deplore? Time was, when (whilst thine unfledge[d] wickedness Flew not in Heav'n's long-patient face, nor tore This judgment down,) I once a week, at least Could at this Board of wonders be a guest. 224 With solid Joy then could I turn mine eye Back on the year, which happily had run: Then could I count what Gains I reaped by My constant trading in Devotion; Rejoycing in my satisfied mind That every Sunday I in heav'n had din'd. 225 But now the flaming Coursers of the Sun Are drawing on the fourteenth month, since I Was sharer in the Celebration Of this sweet life-enliv'ning Mystery: Which yet I then was fain to steal; and so A thief that day to Paradise did go. 226 I went; but woo'd by a forbidden Tree Of Idleness, ah fondly licorish I Believ'd the flattering Bait, and would not see The lurking Hook's too well-known treachery. Dear, wonderous dear, this heedless fault hath cost me, For all my heav'nly joys and powers it lost me. 227 And no recruit do's now that Loss supply, But I'm abandon'd to this tedious Fast: O how the palate of my Soul is dry! What burning Drought doth shrivel up and wast The bowels of my heart! how is my mind With most uncomfortable Squalour pin'd! 228 O how my Understanding's pinions tire, And flag below when I aloft would soar! What leaden Numness damps those hopes of fire With which my Fancy 'gan to glow before? How bankrupt's my Invention since my Wrack Of Judgment upon Lazyness his rock! 229 O how this dry and barren Verse attests The heavy truth of these my Lamentations! Pity me you whose soft and gentle breasts E'r felt the stings of mystical Vexations! Pity me, O my candid Readers, now What makes me tire your patience you know. 230 Had I my wonted portion in that Feast Which with celestial spirits embraves the heart, A fairer Banquet I for you had drest; Who now can only by my starving Smart Warn you to prize and to embrace with most Religious tenderness what I have lost. 231 Lost hitherto: but must that Loss run on, And can my Life mean while make good its name? Can Day maintain her beauty, if the Sun Deny to feed her with his vital flame? Can Rivers keep their full unwearied course If once the living Fountain them divorce? 232 O King of constant Love, whose sumptuous care For hungry hearts that high Provision made; Lo how my famish'd Soul lies gasping here For one dear Crumb of thy mysterious Bread; And craves, to cool her burning tongue, one Drop Of liquid Life from thy all-saving Cup. 233 I know, and feel my worthlessness, and how Unfit I am to hope for any share In those peculiar Delicates, which thou Didst for thy genuine faithful Sons prepare: Yet to a Dog once more they leave afford To catch what falleth from thy Children's Board. CANTO XIII. The Impeachment. The ARGUMENT. Spight, Slander, Scorn, Injustice, rampant grown, Array themselves against Love's single head: He hurried and worry'd up and down Through thousand Wrongs, with mighty Patience fed Their hungry Cruelties, who studied how To blanch their ugly Villany with Law. 1 The azure Spheres, though in a several tract, Their proper Motions endlessly they wheel, With pure harmonious constant friendship act Their mighty Parts; and ne'r were known to reel Beyond their bounds, or by irregular Crossness on one another interfere. 2 The faithful Sun observes from East to West His first appointed Course; and slopes his coach By rule, when he through Cancer's claws would thrust, Or Capricorn's opposed distance reach, Nor stops he there; in our deceived eyes, And not in restless Heav'n the Solstice lies. 3 Exactly constant in her changing face Untired Luna manageth the Night; Which duly she adorns with silver grace, As Titan decks the Day with golden light: And though her self she often waning sees, Yet in her Task admitteth no Decrease. 4 The Spring remembers her appointed Cue? And so doth dull benummed Winter his; For still he worries forward at his due Determin'd season, spight of all the Ice Which clogs his heels, and all the banks of Snows Which up had block'd him in his Northern house. 5 All Plants and Trees their annual Tasks attend, And fertile answer give the Gardner's sweat: No Reptile, Beast or Bird presumes to rend Their God's Prescript, and Nature's Laws forget. Thus loyal Heav'n and Earth contented are Thy yoke, O dear Obedience, to wear. 6 Men, only Men perversly-wanton, throw The reins of Discipline from off their necks; Rowing against the Tide of sacred Law, And madly running upon Vice's rocks: Boldly enforcing thus their heav'nly Lord To draw on Earth his necessary Sword. 7 His Sword he draws, and arms with it the hand Of his Vicegerents; whom a full Commission He gives, the Cause of Justice to defend Against Disorder's daring opposition: That seeing Man would not by God be awed, He might by Man be to his duty bowed. 8 But O what thing so sacred is and strait Which humane Crossness ventures not to wrest! Into Astræa's venerable Seat How oft doth impudent Injustice thrust! How often purple Malefactors are Upon the bench, and Virtue at the bar! 9 When Bribes, when Envy and when Stomach steal Into the ponderation of the Case; Poor helpless Right her undermined Scale Sees quite blown up: for predetermin'd was The cruel Tekel; and this grave ado Of Tryal, only Solemn makes her wo. 10 But to infuse in every bitter Cup His exemplary Sweetness, and persuade His patient Followers to drink it up; A willing Prize Himself great Jesus made To lawless Law, and wonderfully deign'd By Innocency's foes to be arraign'd. 11 A Condescent so rare, that Phylax knew His Pupil 'twould to imitation draw, If ever Tyranny occasion threw In her meek Spirit's way: He therefore now Resolveth by his tutoring Tongue to lead Through this strange story her attentive heed. 12 For her religious Breast was fired now With noble vigor from the Heav'nly Board, And bravely fit to tower, and travel through The loftiest Atchiements of her Lord. This made him haste her from the sacred Cave, When by the holy Kiss sh' had took her leave. 13 Then he conducts her up to Calvary, The Hill of Marvels, that this Prospect might Yield her with uncontrolled Liberty Of Love's chief stations an open sight: And there arriv'd, Mark now, my Dear, said He, What further Wonders Jesus did for thee. 14 Wert thou enthroned on Heav'n's proudest Hill, Which looks o'er all the glories of the Skies, Thou could'st not with a nobler Spectacle Feast there the hunger of thy wondering Eyes; Than from this Mountain's most renowned head. Thou by my Finger and my Tongue shall read. 15 In yonder Street of ruins towring high Stood High-priest Annas's House; but Caiaphas, (His Son by more than Marriage, since the Dye Of guiltless Blood in which they joyn'd, may pass For Consanguinity,) enjoy'd his Den, Where now that Rubbish is the Tomb of sin. 16 Those Caytifs, who had in the Garden seiz'd Thy Lord, to Annas hal'd Him first, to see What Censure's load his Reverend Spight was pleas'd To heap upon the guilt of Piety; But he with cruel Favor Him dismist Unto his Son, the bolder bloodier Priest. 17 Thus Jesus through the Streets and scorn, is led To Caiaphas; who smil'd within, to see What full success had crown'd his Bargain's head, And grudged not the slender price: yet he Still in his Looks, with sage Hypocrisy, Maintain'd his sober Priestly gravity. 18 So hast thou seen a Lyon cast his eyes Upon his harmless prey with stearn disdain, As if his fury long'd for no such prize; Whilst he his greedy paws can scarce contain, Or with his teeth bite in their own desire Of blood: so certain is his salvage ire. 19 In seeming jealous zeal of Peace and Law, Sacred and Civil, he demandeth, Why Throngs of Disciples He presum'd to draw, And with His New-found Doctrines multiply Sects in the Church, and Tumults in the State, Religion and Allegiance to defeat? 20 (Such Impudence on Sin's hard forehead grows, That whilst the Laws of Heav'n and Earth she breaks, On Innocence her own black crimes she throws; And loudly-holy ardent outcries makes Against all Innovations, which on them She chargeth, for whose Blood her thirst doth flame.) 21 Those grave-fac'd Bloodhounds thus, those Elders, who Had sold their Conscience to the barbarous Queen, God's Honor and the King's, pretended to Redeem from Blasphemy: and whilst with keen Hunger and rage for Naboth's Life they hunted, A solemn Fast the shameless Saints appointed. 22 Thy Lord's wise Eye pierc'd through this vain Demand; And why, said He, requir'st thou this of Me? Behold what witness crouds on either hand, Whose gaping Mouths expect their cue from thee. They heard My Preaching; and hear thou what they Against Me, now I challenge them, can say. 23 No Conventicle's sneaking Cloisters hid Those Doctrines which against blind Darkness sought; The Synagogue and Temple witnessed, And so did they themselves whate'r I taught. My Gospel it concern'd the World to know, And from my Lips in publick it did flow. 24 And what more reasonable Word than this From Righteous Wisdom's Mouth could strained be! And yet by being such, alas, it is An augmentation of His Crime; and He Is guilty now at least of Petty-treason Against the Priest, because He speaketh Reason. 25 For strait a surly Sergeant standing by, First bent his angry Brow, and then his Fist; With which at Jesus's Face his spight let fly, Crying, Bold Fellow, Can God's Reverend Priest Deserve no fairer Answer? now we see What kind of Manners grow in Galilee. 26 Would'st thou not look that Thunder's roar should be The echo to that vile unworthy Stroak? For how can Jesus seem unmannerly To any Priest of God, who though He took Dust's servile Vail to shrow'd His glorious head, Still prov'd Himself to be both Priest and God. 27 But from the Lamb's sweet mouth thus Meekness spoke: If in my Answer any Crime there be, Accuse Me thou, and let the Highpriest look That legal Justice be perform'd on Me. If not; before the face of Justice' Seat Why dost thou Mine injuriously beat? 28 Melted by this ingenuous soft Reply The Vulgar Him with silent pity view'd, But Caiaphas, with his Society Of consistorial Scribes and Elders, shew'd What Covenant's poison they had swallow'd down: And past all cure their Zeal's disease was grown. 29 Since of free-cost no Slanderers they could get To bring thy Lord's Impeachment in; they make Their stronger Purse supply their weaker wit, And prodigally now mischievous, seek To hire false-witness, as before they bought That Treason which Him pris'ner thither brought. 30 Is this the venerable Sanhedrim Which hunts so eagerly to find a Lye That Truth may not escape? Are grave and grim Judges the Panders grown of Calumny? In Moses's Chair sits bold Injustice, and Wrests righteous Law by holy Aaron's hand? 31 Ah this is Hell's refined Master-piece Of dangerous Craft, to beautify the face Of horrid dire Intents; and Wickedness So foul a Monster is, that her own Glass Frights her deformity into desire Of sheltering her self in Virtue's tire. 32 Whole troops of Witnesses strait thronged in With thicker Articles: when Rulers dare Once egg the venal Vulgar on to sin; Slander to Conscience never lends her ear; But, in presumption Law is on her side; With furious Impudence delights to ride. 33 But this rude Rout were Younglings yet, and raw Knights of the post, nor had they conn'd their Lye, With warey forecast; or remembred how Their work required perfect memory: This made th'Accusers each impeach his brother Whilst all their stories jarr'd on one another. 34 Yet check'd they must not be, whose clear Intent Aim'd only at the publick Good; least this Should damp new witness with discouragement, Who Articles might urge with more success. Alas, those men came well-affected, but Quite out of count'nance by the Court were put. 35 Their honest meaning by the Sanhedrim Is kindly constru'd, and with thanks requited; That others might with subtler art to trim Their likelyer Accusations be invited; For still the patient Court expects to see Who will the next Calumniators be. 36 But when that first Miscarriage had dismay'd All other Lyars: Satan, who stood by, Snatch'd unto hell his way to fetch some aid, For fear the labouring Priest's ripe Villany, And his great Hopes, should now abortive be: Such care to murder thy dear Spouse had he. 37 Deep in the bowels of eternal Night, Is sunk a dismal Den of choise Damnation, Where Stinks with Stinks maintain a deadly fight, And Ejulation roars at Ejulation; Where Horrors Horrors fright, and where Despair The face of Desperation doth tear. 38 He hither came: when lo the iron Door Gap'd like the thirsty Earth to drink him in; Whilst from the joyful Cavern's mouth a Roar Of sulfury thunder bellow'd, to begin Its Sovereign's welcome; who with gracious look That direful Compliment right kindly took. 39 For in he went; and there his Daughter saw Busy in pouring ever-flaming lead On yelling Souls, whom Lyes and Slanders threw Into that boiling Curse. Upon a bed Of red-hot iron, not yet cooled lay Lust's holocaust, Madam Potiphera. 40 She lay, and bit, and roard and bit again Her slanderous tongue whence deadly shafts she shot At holy Joseph when she had in vain Spent all her eyes' artillery, and what Soft blandishment's quaint wit could muster up To bring about her hot venerial Hope. 41 There lay that foul-mouth'd Ten, whose envious Lye Blasted the florid Sweets of Canaan, Spreading dry Dearth on fat Fertility, And spewing Gall where Milk and Honey ran: One drop of which they wish'd, but wish'd in vain, To cool the fury of their burning Pain. 42 There fry'd that Pair of venal Souls, who by Their hired Falsehood Naboth swore to death; Acting themselves that foul Impiety With which they slander'd him: with flaming breath God and the King they curs'd, and wish'd all hell Melted into the heart of Jezebel. 43 There howling Zedekia felt his own Imposture real prove upon his Heart, Which gored by his iron Horns was grown Beyond the hopes of Cure; and by the Smart Of meet Damnation fully taught him that His Lyes did more himself than Ahab cheat. 44 His throat there Assur's Railer General rent With loud assertion of his Blasphemy; Avouching still, that God expresly sent Him to extirpate Salem's strength: and why Fond Rabsheka do's He thus deep torment thee, For that bold Errand, if on it he sent thee? 45 There raved those two goatish Elders who So reverently bely'd Susanna's fame, As naked now as she, and bathing too, But in a spring of never-dying flame, Well-suting with that fire of leacherous rage Which burnt ev'n in their cold and snowy age. 46 These, and ten thousand more, lay roaring there, The dire remorsless Mistress of the Den Triumphing in their tortures: never Bear With such intemperate fierceness revell'd when Her hungry teeth were flinging ope their way Amidst the bowels of her helpless Prey. 47 Fell Calumny it was; a monstrous She: Her Front and Brows were built of sevenfold brass; An obstinate Swarthiness, which scorn'd to be Pierced by any Blush, besmear'd her face; Her hollow Eyes with peevish Spight were fill'd; Her powting Lips with deadly Venom swell'd. 48 Her dreadful Jaws replenish'd Quivers were, Wherein for Teeth, Spears, Darts and Arrows stood; Her lungs breath'd plagues through all the neighbour air; Her mouth no moisture knew, but blended blood Of Asps and Basilisks, to make her fit Sure Mischief upon Innocence to spit. 49 Ten Dragons' stings all twisted into one Engin of desperate Sharpness, was her Tongue; This made her Language pure Destruction, For dying Knells in every Word were rung; No Sentences composed her Oration At any time but those of Condemnation. 50 Her Brain is that mischievous shop, in which As every other Slander forged was, So that, which, all Examples to out-stretch, Shamelesly dar'd Omnipotence's face, Proclaiming that thy Lord not by his own But Satan's power trampled Satan down. 51 Whenever any rankling Canker breeds Kingdoms' or Countries' fatal overthrow, Her viperous trade it is, the pois'nous seeds Of restless Fears and Jealousies to sow In People's hearts; who strangely readier are To lend to Falshood than to Truth their ear. 52 And O how greedily that Ear drinks in All forgeries this cursed Hag can mint, Whilst she on Kings and Princes joyes to pin Whatever wittyest Envy can invent, To make the Countrie's publick Parent be In his own Children's eyes an Enemy. 53 She spying now her royal Father there, Thus beg'd his benediction on her knee; Bless Me, O awful Sire; and grant me here Some tools of fresh new-fashion'd Cruelty: These Souls are us'd too kindly; all their Pains Grow stale and cold, familiar their Chains. 54 Fear not; it shall be so, cry'd Satan: but Sweet Child, another Work first craves our Care: My Hate's prime But our Judas's help has got Fast in an handsome seasonable snare; I mean that Galilean Beggar, who Pilfring my Subjects' hearts about did go. 55 But now the Priests forsooth are so demure, (And I'l remember 't when I get them here,) That though with Judas they did all conjure, And bought that Christ ev'n at a rate too dear; Their Holinesses some pretence must have How in destroying Him their Fame to save. 56 Confusion on their Fame; who though they dread Not what the thundering wrath of Heav'n can do In vindication of a guiltless Head; Are awed by the putid Vulgar so, That they confess most infamous Impiety, Whilst they the People make their greatest Deity. 57 Base-hearted Hypocrites! Can they not be Brave venturous Sinners, as am I their Prince? Yet since they needs will sneak to hell; sure we For once will help the Fools to their Pretence: They want False-witness for a cloke, and Thou This Livery canst best on them bestow. 58 But see thou mouldst up some athletick Lye, Whose burly bulk all Truth may overbear: Some petty sucking Knaves their best did try, But strait their ill-shod Tales did enterfere. On thee the Feat depends: come let's away; The Highpriest's Court, or rather mine, doth stay. 59 This said: his Daughter by her hand he took, And with more sprightful speed than Indian arrow Cuts Air's soft body, violently broke Earth's sturdy obstacles, and posting thorough The sullen Mass, in jealous fury came Back to his other Home Jerusalem. 60 There when the puzzell'd Council he had ey'd Gaping and staring one upon another; Two itching Rogues he in a corner spy'd Scratching their heads, and beating them together: He smels their meaning strait, and through their breasts His unperceived Daughter slyly thrusts. 61 As when the bosom of the Delphick Priest Rampantly boil'd with his desired hell, His rapture by his gestures he confest, Hastening to vent his belking Oracle: So this accursed Couple kindled by The Fury's vigor, long'd to belch their Lye. 62 Each flung his hand above his working head, Crying, I have it sure; let's to the Bar: And when their Projects they examined, They found that in one mould both minted were: At which they smil'd, and shaked hands, and kist, And flew with full-mouth'd clamor to the Priest. 63 Great Caiaphas, and ye the Sanhedrim, The holy Guardians of Heav'n's reverend Law, Hear us, said they, who will object to Him No tales of Fame, but what we heard and saw Our present selves; and may nor Eye nor Ear, If we a fiction vouch, nor see nor hear. 64 Forgive this Preface: Witness should we know, As naked as the Truth they offer be; But when delinquents so portentous grow As to affright Belief, well well may we This license crave (ah that there were no need!) Our own hard case, no less than Truth's to plead. 65 Notorious 'tis how deep this Pris'ner wrought On Vulgar Hearts by His miraculous Feats: And they, 'tis like, our Evidence will flout Who have enslav'd their Faith to His Deceits. But sure no Jannes, nor no Jambres e'r Shall blind the wisdom of great Moses's Chair. 66 We saw Him strutting in the Temple, where Broaching His most blasphemous Pride, He cry'd, This Hand-erected House I down will tear, And rear another where no Hand shall guide, Or help the Building: intimating that He was forsooth a God, not Mary's Brat. 67 Nay, to be sure His Blasphemy might want No compliment of desperate impudence, Though six and fourty years He knew were spent In compassing this Work's magnificence; He blush'd not to affirm, that three poor days Was all the time He'd take the Pile to raise. 68 Thus needs must He a rank False-prophet be, Or else this sacred Temple lay in dust. Chuse which you will, th'enormous crime you see Is capital: for sure you ne'r will trust Him for the Restauration. Here their roar They ceas'd, presuming that they home had swore. 69 But how shall rash self-shattering waves, maintain Themselves against impenetrable Rocks! This brittle wretched Slander beats in vain On Innocence's firmitude, and wracks Its own split spight, could but the Highpriest's eye Have seen its shivers which about did fly. 70 For grant this confident Article as true As it was false; why must it branded be As Blasphemy in Him, who in the view Of ample witness prov'd His Potency Sufficient was the Temple to restore, When He from Death her captive Lazarus tore? 71 To re-erect that little Building, was A piece of Architecture which alone Outvy'd all Herod's power, and did surpass The wit and wealth of sumptuous Solomon. No Hand but Heav'n's that sovereign strength can have Which layeth Life's foundation on the Grave. 72 Yet to a murmur buzz'd about the Hall, Toss'd by the silly Rout from one another: The Council gravely shak'd their heads; and all Mingled their jealous whisperings together: Till Caiaphas stood up, and ask'd thy Lord Why He would no Reply to's Charge afford? 73 But Jesus, who ne'r spilt a word in vain, (For sweet and precious was his blessed Breath,) No answer would to that Impeachment deign, Which crosses well-known Truth, and carrieth Its Answer in it self to any Ear, But that which is resolved not to hear. 74 The Priest's curs'd expectation being by This generous silence quite confuted, he Consults his own malicious subtilty, And Answered there at least presumes to be: Yet pumps his desperate Wits in vain, until Satan with fresh Advice his head did fill. 75 Which so embrav'd his Impudence, that now This Savior deeply he contests to make Him prove His own Accuser: Well we know, Said he, those towring Words of thine must speak A more than Mortal Power; nor must thou hope Thy silence now shall lock the bus'ness up. 76 For by the ever-living God, whose Name Too glorious is on human Tongues to sit, I thee conjure expresly to proclaim, Whether thou art the Christ, whom holy Writ Has promis'd to the World, that Blessed One, The Heir of Heav'n, and God's Eternal Son. 77 O who would think this consecrated Tongue, Which with such reverential Awe can quote God and His Word, mean while should burn in strong Thirst of most guiltless Blood! but Hell can shoot It self through Heav'n, and Satan dares make one Amongst the Sons of God before His Throne. 78 Hence he his Scholars teacheth to begin The foulest crimes with God's all-beauteous Name; So with a winning cheat to usher in What else by plain and necessary shame Would be obstructed. Thus the Charmer's Tongue Distils his poison through his dainty Song. 79 But He who came Truth's glorious Lamp to light, Was pleased now to give a clear Reply: His Heav'n, His Sire, Himself did Him invite Himself, His Sire, His Heav'n to verify. In Me, said He, fulfill'd your Scriptures are, God's Son am I, and Heav'n's apparent Heir. 80 And though your Eyes now look such scorn on Me, Time comes when they shall melt in tears for This; When on the Cloud's high Chariot they shall see My Majesty in Glory's bright excess, And by my march's flash have light to know I own a Judgment-seat, as well as you. 81 No sooner was this glorious Truth profest, But Caiaphas in deep dissimulation His politickly-bloody malice drest; For starting from the Bench, with zealous passion He tore his cloaths, in token of his high Horror at that presumed Blasphemy. 82 So when the barbarous Crocodil doth flame With greedy ire against his present Prey; His cursed eyes will needs religious seem, Pouring out yearning tears to wash away By Pity's flood the shame of that foul fact, He so impatiently gapes to act. 83 Vain Hypocrite, keep whole thy Cloths to hide Thy shameless self; whom thou one day shalt tear For this thy emblematick Trick, to bid The People use the Pris'ner at the Bar As thou thy Robe: But they are dull, and yet Read not what thou commend'st to them by it. 84 They read it not: But, Psyche, salvage He Awakes their drousy cruelty, and cries, What need we further Witnesses? for ye Have heard His wide-mouth'd raving Blasphemies. Speak what you think; so plain's the Case to me, That I dare let His friends His Judges be. 85 O sage, O righteous Judge, and fit to wear The sacred Mitre, who doth first invite The People's Mouths to Blood, and then repair To their wild Sentence! Whether wrong or right, Speak what think you, a firebrand is and will Kindle the fury of their murdering Zeal. 86 Refer the harmless Chicken's case unto The censure of the hungry Kite: Demand The Wolf's opinion of the Lamb; and who Can doubt what judgment they will pass, who bend The utmost nerves of all their Wit and Might Upon those Innocents to feast their spight? 87 Their feet these Blood-hounds felt no sooner loose, But they pursu'd the scent, and with joint cry Their common sense proclaimed thus: May those Not live, who think He is not fit to die. This roaring Sentence serv'd the turn; and so Abused Jesus for Condemn'd must go. 88 What matter though the sacred Rolls can show No Statute which His Life as forfeit touches? This popular Extemporal Vote is Law Enough, to yield Him into barbarous clutches; And He, so foul and monstrous is His Case, Must die for breaking that which never was. 89 Forthwith the busy Officers, and all The insolent Servants seize Him as their prey; And in the middle of the smoaky Hall, His gentle Patience make their froward play: Where, as a preface to His deep disgrace, Their odious scorn they spit upon His Face. 90 One at His Mouth, another at His Eyes, One at His Beard, another at His Nose His slaver aims, and impudently tries To shoot his shame with art. O putid Foes, Where are your Eyes and Face, that you can His Bedaub so thick with studied Noisomness! 91 What rival Excellence could e'r compare With this Majestick Look? is Libanus, Is Paradise, is Heav'n, so sweetly-fair? Are Titan's Eyes so mildly-glorious? Is delicate Aurora's April cheek, So roseal as this, so soft, so sleek? 92 Cull out ten thousand of th'exactest Faces Where goodly Feature ever made her home; Yet must the Exactest of their richest Graces, Array'd in bashful yielding blushes come Into the presence of this Aspect, where The Rule and Standard of all Beauties are. 93 No other Scene of glorious Loveliness Had everlasting Bliss to feast the Eye; An ample Banquet furnish'd were in this Accomplish'd Countenance, to justify Their Faith beyond exception, who conclude Vision the sum of pure Beatitude. 94 And must all Gracefulness's radiant Throne Of your vile Excrement the sink be made? Rather on Caiaphas his Cheeks, or on Great Cesar's, this rank Contumely spread; Or on the Stars, whose Eyes all lighted are At those bright Lamps your filth beclouded here. 95 This strange Requital must his Spittle find, His Sovereign Spittle, which bestowed sight, Unknown, unhop'd-for sight, upon the Blind; That His own Eyes' all-love-deserving light, Must in your foul-mouth's scum be drown'd!—O stay, Dear Psyche, I have something more to say. 96 Thy loyal streams are ready broach'd, I see, To wash this odious Wrong from off His Face; But rein them in a while, that they may be Officious to thy Lord's more deep Disgrace. The saddest part's behind; and fit for thine, And all the pious World's lamenting brine. 97 This word so awed Psyche's sorrow, that Biting her Lip, she bit off half her sigh; And having dry'd her cheeks, a conquest got Against her will, of forward sympathy. Then pray'd she Phylax to proceed; and He Thus spun on Grief's triumphant History. 98 These Varlets, when their clotted spittle had Besmear'd His Face with so much ugly froth, That they their own work's sight abhorr'd; their Bad They turn to Worse: for strait they wind a cloth About his patient Head, which should have been To wipe away, not hide, their nasty Sin. 99 Thus blinding both of Heav'n and Earth the Light, Some with their Fists, some with their Cudgels fly Upon His Head and Shoulders; and their spight So gamesom is, that His Calamity Must find them sport, and all His bruses be The ticklings of their barbarous Jollity. 100 The petulant Caytifs, as they thresh Him, cry, Great Sir, we know you are a Man of God; Be pleased therefore now to prophesy Who aims at you the Cudgel or the Rod. No matter though your eyes that towel bind, Prophets are Seers, and cannot be blind. 101 No surer way could Peevishness contrive Its most malicious self to multiply; For every jeer they spit and stroke they give, Is now improved, and do's double fly: With witty Cruelty to overbear Him, They teach each jeer to strike, each stroke to jeer Him. 102 Ignoble scorn, and sordid insultation, Add Bitterness unto the Soul of Gall, And stretch all torturing Racks with new vexation, When they upon Heroick Spirits fall: Who then that stinging sorrow's gulph can sound, With which these Taunts thy Lord's brave Heart did wound! 103 For all the Metal of illustrious worth Which ever temper'd Greek or Roman Breast, Was glorious Dross to that which had its birth From Heav'n and Mary; that, which not the least Degenerous mixture e'r deflour'd: so high Was Jesus His refined Gallantry. 104 But on your heads, bold Worms, your Mocks rebound; For he less blinded is than you, and sees Your antick villany; and those profound Sinks of unfathomable Wickedness, Those Hearts of yours, which open he at last To all the World's both view and hate shall cast. 105 You then shall need no Prophesy to clear Who stroke the first, or who the second Blow; Whose stroke's the hardest, jeers the bitterest were, Who did the quaintest art of Malice show: Your foul Exploits shall then be printed fair Upon your Foreheads, and themselves declare. 106 Whilst at this Working-play they busy were, Thy Lord ne'r shrunk nor sought to shield His Head: No Butt with firmer constancy could e'r Welcome the Arrow's wounds; nor ever did The patient Anvil more unmoved stand Under the labouring Smith his iron Hand. 107 For He resolved was Himself to wade Quite through the reddest sea of Shame and Pain, To bless and sanctify the Valiant Trade Of Patience, and by His example train His faithful Martyrs' noble Army in Religion's quarrel, Glory's Bay to win. 108 Tir'd by His Tolerance, at length, in loth Compassion of themselves these Feinds give over, Snatching from His victorious Head the Cloth, Which now to deeper Grief did Him discover; For His Disciple strait He heard and saw Bruising Him with a far more violent Blow. 109 Peter, of late so fix'd and resolute, who Had boasted that the grimmest face of Death Should not out-look his Faith, and Duty to His Royal Master; with the self-same Breath, Had twice renounced his Allegiance, and Now on the brink of his third Fall did stand. 110 For as he lingred in the Hall to see, His fear's event about his Lord; a stout And busy Actor in the Treachery, By Judas's lately headed, cries, About This sneaking Rogue, what need we clearer proof? Is not his Galilean Tongue enough? 111 Then with sure claw his Throat arresting; I Remember your bald Pate: nay, never stare, Nor puff, nor gape, nor study for a lye, To mask the part you in the Garden bare, But, Sirrah, know that now I have you here, I must and will revenge my Cosen's Ear. 112 Nor think this leathern staring Pair of yours Can pay the debt you ow his single One: We know the Witch your Master's conjuring powers Can clap them on again: but by the Throne Of God, I vow, that now I'll take a course To make thee sure, in spight of Magick force. 113 It is no running, nor no sculking now; No shades, no trees are here; before the Priest D 'ye see your Goodly Leader yonder, how Silenc'd with Truth, with heavy Guilt opprest, Quite dumb, half dead He stands? Friend you must go, And in His Censure be His Follower too. 114 Forthwith the Soldiers justling round about, Besieg'd his frighted Soul with thicker dread. So have I seen a peevish snarling rout Of hasty Curs agreeing down to tread The fallen Dog, and for no cause at all, But that 'twas his unhappy hap to fall. 115 As when the waves which in his way grew high, Had wrack'd his Faith which bore him up before, His sinking Heart was quickly follow'd by His frighted Feet: so his Accusers' roar Now storming in his Ears, distrustful He Yields to this tempest's importunity. 116 Yet there he crav'd his Savior's help: but now He sinks so deep that he despairs of that, And with vile Cowardise contriveth how To save his wretched Skin: he cares not what He curses, swears, or lyes, so any shift Him from his Panick-gulf may serve to lift. 117 Hark O ye high-conceited Mortals, who Presume your strength may scorn the battery Of any earthly or infernal foe; Beat not this Heart of late with full as high Resolves as yours? yet now it faints away; And all his Courage melteth to Dismay. 118 Ah silly Confidence, which dares erect Its pile on fragil Dust! the Bubble thus When puff'd with widest pride, is soonest crackt; Thus when the foolish Smoak's voluminous Ambition aims to reach the lofty sphere, It quickly vanisheth to empty air. 119 By Heav'n, he cries, and Him who heav'n did frame, By all the Sanhedrim, the sacred Law, The Temple and its Gold, by Pilate's name, By Cesar's head, by whatsoe'r I know Divine or reverend, I freely swear That I'm a stranger to the Pris'ner there. 120 If I were with Him in the Garden, may I never enter blessed Paradise; In Abraham's bosom may I never lay My head, if ever it did rest in His; On me may Egypt's Plagues, and Sodom's Flame Be pour'd, if till to day I knew His Name. 121 'Tis true, I am of Galilee: but was It in my power in Jewry to be born? I'm ne'r the less of Israel's holy Race, Nor for a world would I Apostate turn: I'm Moses's Scholar: Hell their portion be Who e'r would such a Master change as he. 122 Right lusty are thine Oaths, and generously Thy daring Imprecations thou dost thunder, Reply'd the Soldier; and why might not I For once mistake? for I confess I wonder How thou couldst serve that sheepish Master there, Who canst so bravely Curse, and stoutly Swear. 123 Thou knowst 'twas dark, and let my Error be Scor'd on Night's back, whose shades abus'd mine eye: Go then, (and here upon his shoulder he Clapped his barbarous applause,) but by Thine own rare Oaths I swear, thou lookest still As like that Rogue as Tophet do's to Hell. 124 Thus gained he his too dear liberty, And lost himself: but as he sneak'd away; A crowing Cock awak'd his memory Into the broad light of his Dutie's day: His startled Eyes strait hasted to repent, And back to Jesus with submission went. 125 When lo, mild He, who could no Pity find, To ease His own oppressed Innocence, With ready beams of heav'nly kindness shin'd Upon His Servant's traytorous Offence; Forewarning Peter how to use his Sheep When they down Error's precipice should leap. 126 Denyed Jesus would not him deny, But spake His pardon by His gracious Look: Yet so that Peter might withal descry, Deep written in that most pathetick book, The piteous copy of that causeless smart, With which his Falshood pierc'd his Saviour's heart. 127 Powerful and long the Sermon was which He Preach'd in th'epitomy of this short Glance. But with such speed all Wonder's love to be Atchiev'd when Flashes of Omnipotence Weilded by Grace's hand the work assist; Witness the Miracle in Peter's breast. 128 That breast which by this Glimpse was vanquish'd so, That driv'n by holy shame, he seeketh where To weep away his ugly Crime; and lo His Tears now bitterer than his Curses were. Thus when the Sun on sturdy Ice but looks, It strait repenteth into running brooks. 129 But now Aurora from the roseal East Had newly dress'd and sent abroad the Day; To finish his Design of Night, the Priests To Pilate's court dispatch'd thy Lord away: Nor needs he teach his Miscreants what to do, Who Spight's fell trade had better learn'd than so. 130 The boistrous Rout with galling cords and chains Load Jesu's hands and feet, and hurry Him With headlong haste through all the streets and lanes; Which sweat with Crouds,—who an outrageous stream Of odious blasphemies and curses shed At every step He takes, upon His head. 131 Hast thou not mark'd how in a silver night The mad-brain'd mungrels gather in the street; Where with united barkings at the light Of beauteous Phebe, heav'n and earth they beat? Such and so causless were the Clamours which Against thy Lord these railing Throngs did stretch. 132 But thus arrived at the Palace, they The Pris'ner in to Pilate gravely send; For 'twas with them an high religious day, Nor could unhallowed Places but offend Their scrupulous strictness; who all cleansed were To celebrate their reverend Passover. 133 Shame on their foul Hypocrisy, who in This goodly Mask of zealous Sanctity With eager Fury strive to act a Sin Too horrid to be expiated by Their greatest Sacrifices; and would fain By this Lamb's blood their Paschal one destain. 134 But when the Judge came forth, demanding what Offence exposed Jesu's Life to Law; The surly Priests grew insolently hot, And cry'd, We hop'd the Governor e'r now Had understood that Israel's Sanhedrim No Malefactor makes without a Crime. 135 Can it be dreamt we'd take such pains to chain A Lamb, and send him for a Wolf to thee? If so; what need disputes? the case is plain; We, we alone must here Delinquents be: O then release that righteous Soul, and bid The slanderous Sanhedrim be Crucifi'd. 136 To this bold shift was Malice driv'n to make Meer Accusation for Conviction pass. But wisely then reply'd the Judge, why take You this long way about? since you so gross Have found His Crimes, you might, and may do now, Make Him a sacrifice to your own Law. 137 True, said the Priest; nor had our pious Zeal Loiter'd thus long, did but our Law permit Our indignation liberty to deal With such a Malefactor as is fit: Surely we in our looks have written plain And legible enough, our just Disdain. 138 But our Lawgiver's gentle heart did ne'r Provide a Death for such a Monster, as He ne'r suspected any Jew could dare To shew himself; and this is Jesus's case. His due's the Cross; and none, great Sir, but you That decent vengeance can on Him bestow. 139 The generous Roman shak'd his head to see The Priests so shameless in their bloody Hate: And yet to cool their mutinous Spirits, he Commands the Pris'ner to the Judgment Seat; Requiring His Impeachment might in clear And open terms before the Court appear. 140 Forc'd here their troubled fraud to shelter in The sanctuary of some strong-built Lye; If we, said they, by His outragious Sin But able were to mould and tune our Cry, The noise not only would amaze your ear, But rend all Heav'n, and Vengeance hither tear. 141 For know, that in profoundly-bold despight To God, and that unspotted Truth which We Receiv'd from Him, this Brat of hellish night Blush'd not to broach blasphemous Heresy, But through the honest credulous Country ran Tainting the Commons with his Doctrine's bane. 142 Yet well it were if Heav'n alone had been His desperate Mischief's butt: most traytorous He Both hop'd, and try'd to work His dangerous teen On Earth, and its Imperial Majesty; Great Cesar's tribute down He preach'd, and yet Up for a King Himself the Varlet set. 143 Thus roard the Priests. But when the Judge had well The bus'ness weigh'd by grave examination, And found its big-look'd bulk with Malice swell And not with Truth: he made this Protestation: Had I your eyes, I know not what might be, But with mine own, no fault in Him I see. 144 He, that He is a King doth not deny; But mark what Royalties he challengeth: So simple is His Ingenuity, He owns no Territories here beneath. What harm to Cesar can by Him be done Who fancyeth his Kingdom in the Moon? 145 There let His idle fancy reign: but yet 'Tis pity for His folly He should Die. What Justice ever counted Want of Wit A capital Offence. Nay more, if I Be right informed, in the Tribute He Hath witness'd His sufficient Loyalty. 146 The Case was put, and cunningly, to try What at the bottom lay of His Design: Yet by His Doctrine He most readily Asserted it, and doubted not to join His Practise too: what Custom more, I pray, Could Cesar wish, than both to Preach and Pay? 147 As when the flames by Winds are beaten back, With boiling murmur they their wrath increase, And with more violent combustion mock The pacifying Gale's attempt: so these Repulsed Priests more hot and raging grew And with full mouth these Exclamations blew. 148 All dangerous Impostures know their trade And foul Intents with fair Pretences paint: Whate'r He craftily or Preach'd or Pay'd, Was but to shield Himself from Law's restraint: Sedition was His Drift, and He could ne'r Persue that game unless he footloose were. 149 'Tis strange wise Pilate should not clearly see What through our Nation is so sadly spred; For all Samaria, and Judea He With mutinous Principles envenomed; Whose egs He hatch'd in Galilee; a Nest Of all the world for such a brood the best. 150 But this deferr'd their bloody hopes; for now They father'd Him on Galilee, it put Pilate upon a politick search to know If He to Antipas' Command might not Of right belong; which having gladly found, Strait to the Tetrarch he dispatch'd Him bound. 151 Nor fail'd this cunning Compliment to reach The mark of his Desires, which was to win The Tetrarch's love, and close that rupture which Had in their wounded friendship gaping been. Jesus, who found no friends Himself must be The means to cement others' Amity. 152 Thus through new Streets and new Revilings, He To surly Herod's lodging bandied is: The Prince could not conceal his joy to see Him whom his unbelieving Curiousness Had oft desir'd, since trumpeting Report With Christ's strange Acts had fill'd his wondring Court. 153 And now himself he cheateth into hope The Pris'ner His good will and word to gain, Would rouze His utmost skill and power up Him with miraculous Feats to entertain. For Herod knew that this Man was He Who scorn'd to buy His life with flattery. 154 His Questions thick he spur'd, but spur'd in vain; Wise Jesus would no idle motions mind, Nor any Answer but of Silence deign; And though the Priests and Scribes their Railings join'd, He said as little to their shameless Lye As to the Tetrarch's Curiosity. 155 Is this, said Herod then, with big disdain, Great Cesar's Rival, one who's only fit Sovereign of sheepish stupid fools to reign? Is this that wonder-working He, who yet In this hard pinch can not with Power or Brain His scorn'd, accus'd, and challeng'd self maintain? 156 Is all the wide-spread Glory of His Name? Are all His Miracles shrunk up to this, That He Himself with most ignoble shame Should prove a Miracle of Sottishness? Is this the King, to find whose heart my Father A thousand Infants' breasts tore ope together? 157 Ah how my fancy wrong'd brave John, when I Dream'd this was He to life again arriv'd! Yet grant it John; His gross Stupidity Assures me still that he is not reviv'd. Come Souldiers, use your antick wits, that so We may have sport at least, before He go. 158 Glad were the Guard, and ready equally Jesus to mock, and to content their Lord: About Him round they danc'd with hideous Cry, And bid Him still that Tempest with His Word; And when His Patience silent stood, enjoyn'd Him To cast out that dumb Devil which did bind Him. 159 One limping came, and His great Godship pray'd To cure his Leg, then kick'd Him on the breast: For his lame Hand another crav'd His aid, Then beat and brus'd Him with his brawny Fist; A third desir'd Him to restore a dead Dog unto life, then threw it at His head. 160 To vary this most scornful sport; at last Come dress Him like a Prince, the Tetrarch cry'd, And let the Jews return their King to taste What Banquet Pilate will for Him provide: Perhaps 'twill make Him ope that mouth which He So obstinately here hath shut at me. 161 Tell him, I thank him for his Courtesy; It made me merry, as ye all have seen: But I'l not rob his Lordship's Pleasures by Detaining this his Idiot; when I mean To play with fools, I hope my Galilee With one such Puppet more may furnish me. 162 Thus Jesus in a gorgeous Robe is clad, The more conspicuous to make His shame: And so through fresh Disdains and Scoffings led To be of further Tyranny the Game. With such a Pageant of Contempt the base Abusive vulgar never feasted was. 163 They dance, they hout, they hollow, winck, and grin, And this occasion trayterously embrace Upon all princely Ornaments to pin Their scornful Jeers. But Pilate stricken was With wiser wonder at His splendid hue, Knowing what Garb was to Delinquents due. 164 For those whose Lives presum'd as forfeit were To Death, by Custom's sad solemnity Were tir'd in Funeral Black, which might prepare Them to the thoughts of their Catastrophe, And intimate the colour of that Sin Whose horrid darkness cloth'd their souls within. 165 But Providence did so correct their spight, That He whose breast was purer than the Day, Wore in His Vesture's face no guilty Night, But by His Foes' own hands in an Array Of Glory shin'd, and was absolved when They hal'd Him to His Condemnation. 166 So when a boistrous loud Conspiracy Of Winds their puffing labouring fury blow About the World, in hopes to damp the sky With swarthy clouds and storms; they often throw All Vapors out, and with a full and fair Serenity attire the purged Air. 167 Check'd by the sense of that pure Vestment's look, And feeling moral Honesty beat high In's startled bosom, Pilate could not brook His Conscience to be Slave unto the Cry Of those importunate Jews, who roaring stood, And gap'd with thirsty mouths for guiltless blood. 168 What me concerned I have done, said he; Him, and your Accusations have I Oft sifted to the bottom: as for me, I hope I never gave you reason why You should presume that any Clamors may Fright Pilate out of Justice's Highway. 169 Your Temple or your Altars cannot be More venerable unto you, than is My yet-unspotted Judgment-Seat to Me; And mine, I trust, shall all impatient Cries Of groundless Rage as valiantly resist As Minos, or as Rhadamanthus's breast. 170 What I to Cesar ow, and what to Right, I long have known, and must not now forget: My heart is Roman, and the dearest Light Of Heav'n or Life far less inamors it, Than Honor's splendor, which can never be Cohabitant with Wrong and Tyranny. 171 In Pilate's Annals shall it e'er be read, That he deflowr'd Tiberius's sword, and most Divine Astræa fouly ravished, And that not by his own but others' Lust? That Jewry's Ruler trembled at a Voice, And was subdu'd by nothing but a Noise? 172 I'll sooner chuse mine own heart-blood should flow, And let your Thirst carouze in it, than I From any guiltless Veins their streams will draw, To quench the loudest Importunity. Mine is mine own; but what have I to do To give another's Life, when Law says No? 173 Law takes no hold of Jesus, nor must I, Nor did the Tetrarch; and why, why will you But since I see that crafty Calumny Abused hath your honest meaning, now I'll for your Credit Him chastise, and so Give Him dismission without more ado. 174 And this the rather, since by custom I Ingaged am to honor this your Feast, In granting some Offendor Liberty, Whom fit your Pity counts to be releast: And who deserves your candor more than this Poor Man, whose fault at most but Folly is. 175 Thus strove the Judge, that he might not condemn Himself with Jesus; but the sullen Priests His gracious Offer spitefully contemn, And spur the People (in whose fury rests Their final hope,) to beg with all the strife Of stoutest Throats, none but Barabbas's Life. 176 Bold Bloodhounds! is not this Barabbas he Whom you your selves know guilty of the Fact, You fain would fasten upon Jesus? ye Beheld what tumults he presum'd to act, And how his desperate Riot he persued, Until in Murder he his hands imbrued. 177 Hold you the Murderer's Life so dear, that he Must live with you, whilst Innocent Jesus dies? And do's Barabbas's cursed Company Suit better with your reverend Sanctities? Or think you God and Man so blind, as not To see and hate your grosly-barbarous Plot? 178 Strange, Psyche, 'twas, with what impatient cries The Mad-brain'd Vulgar, Heav'n and Earth did tear: Barabbas's Name through all their Clamor flies, Anxious for him, and none but him they are; He is their Darling, and they cannot live, If Pilate will not grant them his Reprieve. 179 Thus hellish Hate op'd Providence's door To heav'nly Love, and made Barabbas be The Type of all the World; which from the power Of endless Death, and equal Misery Was to be snatch'd to day, and in its room A harmless Lamb expos'd to bloody Doom. 180 Mean while, the Judge's Lady sent her Page, To pray her worryed and perplexed Lord Not to be mad, because that Rout did rage, Nor venture to prophane the Roman Sword With Holy Blood; since certainly, said she, Jesus is just, and they seditious be. 181 For my good Genius, as I lay asleep, Appear'd unto me hand in hand with thine; Thine beat his Breast, and bitterly did weep, And told the reason of his grief to mine: He said, (and sigh'd, and trembled as he said) Pilate with Jesus now will be betray'd. 182 Pilate will be betrayed to destroy The Life of Jesus, and his own withal; For Jesu's Blood will cry another day, And loud to Pilate's Veins and Heart will call: His Veins and Heart must to that Call reply— —I started here, and out the Dream did fly. 183 Thus Heav'n-admonished Claudia sought to fright Her Husband from his Precipice's brow, And gave miraculous witness to the bright Integrity of Jesus in the view Of all His foes; for Heav'n was pleas'd that He By either sex now justify'd should be. 184 No sooner had the trembling Page deliver'd His ominous Message, but the Judge's Heart With fatal jealousy and horror shiver'd; His Joints unbuckled; Eyes and Hair did start; His Knees together smote; his Blood flew back, And left his Lips and all his Visage black. 185 O gracious Lord! who never fails to send Smart warnings ev'n to Pagan Hearts, when they By strong Temptations baited are, to rend And throw their own upright Resolves away: So monstrous is a Conscience-stifling Evill; So loth is God that Man should prove a Devil. 186 But when the Scribes and Priests had learn'd the News: See how this Conjurer hath by Magick Art, Cry'd they, sent hellish Spirits to abuse The honest thoughts of noble Claudia's Heart: That by this Trick the Judge might frighted be, Our Truths made Slanders, and Himself set free. 187 'Tis well the Lady signify'd that she Sleep's pris'ner was and so Delusion's prize: But this Impostor's Life shall find that we Are waking, and know how to use our Eyes. The Wife may to her rest again; but keep We must and will the Husband now from sleep. 188 Strait all the People with fresh clamors roar'd, Thund'ring Barabbas in the Judge's Ear: Which violent storm quite blew away the Word His Spouse had sent; and he through sudden fear Of Insurrection, thus returns to treat About the bus'ness which he most did hate. 189 Friends, ask, I pray, your second thoughts, and see If they upon Barabbas needs will dote: 'Tis far from my desire your Haste should be Your prejudice; 'twas Haste made you so hot Against your smother'd Reason: but my leave To make your choice again, I freely give. 190 For I would fain my Courtesy should be True to its Name; which sure cannot be so, If none but this bold Murderer must be he, Whom you will let my Love on you bestow. Consider well, and you will find it stand More with your Credits, Jesus to demand. 191 But that Advice melts into empty air, Which woos the Vulgar to Consideration: And Pilate might as well, by speaking fair, Have hop'd to send a Torrent's Inundation Back to its spring-head, to consult and see Whether it had not best more gentle be. 192 For at this word enrag'd, they all renew Their former Outcry; For Barabbas we, And for none other but Barabbas sue; Our Fame no plaster craves or needs: you see We beg but wonted Favor, which if you Thus geld by cutting off our Choice, Adieu. 193 Mov'd with their boistrous Madness, Pilate cries, If this seditious Murderer alone Can seem to you to be a worthy Prize, Tell me what must with Innocence be done? Both cannot be reprieved: therefore speak What course with Christ shall I and Justice take? 194 Right glad the Judge had giv'n them leave to name The manner of their plotted Cruelty; They with a barbarous smile reply, The Game Is not so hard to play; Let Jesus die: Do you but doom Him to the Cross, and We At charge of Executing Him will be. 195 Then, as an Army with united Shout Rends all the Field, when most impatient they Fly to their Work of Blood: th'unanimous Rout Discharg'd at Pilate's Ear, and cry'd, Away, Away with Him, that Justice on may ride In her free course, Let Him be crucify'd. 196 O more than hellish Impudence and Spight! Is this the People, whose high Estimation Of Jesus could the Highpriest's projects fright Into a secret cautious Conjuration! The People, who admir'd His heav'nly Word, And His convincing Miracles ador'd! 197 The People, who to pave His welcome way, Could strip Trees' bodies, and their own, and spread That Princely Entertainment, to display How ev'n His Ass's feet they honored! The People, who could brave Hosanna cry! A Word, O how unlike to Crucify! 198 How well sage Heads have fix'd the odious brand Of Fickleness upon the Vulgar! for More safely may you on the Lydian Sand, Or on the Adriatick Billows, or The flitting Winds, build Towers, than rely Upon the multitude's Fidelity.) 199 The horror of that Word made Pilate start; Who, stepping back, and flinging up his hands, Far be it, cry'd, far be it from my heart To harbor such Injustice! Your Demands Should not be Traps; nor is it fit that I Turn Tyrant, others' Spight to gratify. 200 Wears He the stain of Murder, or of Treason, To mark Him out for death? can any eye Barabbas find in Him? Or is it reason That He because He has no Crime, must die? And can you choose no Instrument but Me, The Pandar of your bloody Lust to be? 201 Great Cesar thinks me wise enough to hear And judge of Cases; and why will not you? I have (though with some prejudice; so far Your zeal had biass'd me,) the Pris'ner through A strict Examen drawn; and must withal Confess, His Crime is far from capital. 202 And shall my Foes' glad Tongues have cause to say, To my dear Honor's vile confusion, that Pilate bow'd down his Conscience to obey A Lawless Motion. Henceforth urge me not: Some reasonable Castigation, I Will lay on Jesus; but He must not die. 203 As when a knot of eager Hornets are Repressed by a wary hand, about With doubled rage they fly, and buzzing their Right smart, alarms more resolutely, the stout Onset renew: So now in fiercer Cries, The Rout's disdain at this Repulse did rise. 204 The Cataracts of Nile, or those which tear Their headlong way down steepest Alpes, make not A fra[n]gor so astonishing, as their Wide yelling Mouths, resolv'd no more to shut Till they can conquer by Impetuousness; And, Crucify Him, still their thunder is. 205 The frighted Palace trembled at the crack, Whose dismal echo to the Temple flew; And from the Temple loudly bounding back, It self through all the startled City threw. Yea, ev'n the Rout themselves could not forbear, Against their own Request to stop their Ear. 206 Which whilst thus terribly it bellow'd, though It shak'd the Judge, and made him stagger; yet It fail'd to work his total overthrow: For fast he clapp'd his arms about his great And generous Resolution, nor could He fall (and that he knew) except he would. 207 Then wisely pondering that the Highpriest's spight The coals of all this mad Combustion blew; And that they on the headstrong Vulgar might, Had built their Salvage hopes: he studies how To frustrate their malicious Design By a severe, yet tender Countermine. 208 For in he takes thy Lord, and yields Him to The servile Scourge, that by this Cruelty, Way to His Pity he might ope, and so Some blood for all the rest might satisfy. He hop'd if once they saw Him all in gore, Their thirstiest Malice would not wish for more. 209 For though the Multitude's untutor'd Ears Are deaf to Reason's Plea; their Eyes can hear The mute but loud complaint of bloody Tears, And understand the Dialect, whene'er It flows from Wound's red lips: And why, said He, May Jews, if they be Men, not Human be! 210 The surly Beadles fetch'd their strongest Tew, And having stripp'd their patient Prey of all His cloths' defence, with churlish twitches drew, And to the stoutest pillar of the Hall Fast bound Him up; least He, by sinking under The lashe's load, their wrath's carreer should hinder. 211 With iron Whips then to their work they fell, And plow'd his Back's delicious Garden up: Profound and long the Furrows were, yet still Levell'd and fill'd as fast as broken ope; For drown'd they were, and drowned in no flood, But of their own inestimable Blood. 212 Down to the bottom of each tender Vein The cruel Engins div'd, and tore from thence The precious purple springs; which in disdain They toss'd about, until their violence In too too costly colours painted thick, Upon th'unworthy Floor and Pillar stuck. 213 The Pillar and the Floor now blush'd to see How those remorsless Bloodhounds knew no shame; For still they prosecute their tyranny, Till weariness prevails with tired them. (As lately with the Servants of the Priest,) Meerly in self-compassion to desist. 214 But then the Soldiers take their barbarous cue, To vex His Patience with more witty spight: And that He may some royal token shew Of His pretended Kingship their conceit Prompts them to wreath a Crown of Thorns, and it Upon His Head, in Fury's triumph set. 215 And thus the Curse which Heav'n injoin'd to grow On Sin-condemned Earth, from thence is rent, And deep engrafted into Jesus's Brow; Who with this Diadem of stings content, Nor wish'd nor envied their dainty pride, Whose tresses were in roseal chaplets ty'd. 216 Then on His Back, to mock His Temples' pain With gorgeous scorn, a purple Robe they throw: Alas, how needless! now in richer grain Too full they see His native scarlat flow, Whilst all His Body is arrayed round In one expanded universal wound. 217 And having planted in His Hand a Reed, (A silly Scepter, and which well comply'd With His ignoble Crown,) themselves they spread In several gamesom squadrons, to deride This meekly-silent miserable Thing, Whom of Contempt they had created King. 218 O may the Sovereign of the Jews, said they, Outlive the Hart's, the Raven's, the Eagle's years! May His victorious Ensigns He display Throughout the World, affrighted at His Wars! Thus may He thresh all Nations: and here They bang'd and brus'd Him; and went on to jeer: 219 May Heav'n's propitious Eye for ever dwell On Him, who best deserves its care! may all The Clouds which with the fattest Blessings swell Let on His Head their choisest riches fall, As freely as we rain these drops on it! And at this word they all upon Him spit. 220 High on the Roman Bird's Imperial wing May thy illustrious Name and Glory ride! And may Tiberius to this nobler King Thus yield his mighty Throne! this said, a wide And massy Chair full at His Face they throw, Which deeply grav'd its footsteps in His Brow. 221 From all the proudest Conqueror's Temples, who Fondly conceive their never-fading Bay Has power to make themselves immortal too, Their glorious wreaths thus mayst Thou rend away! Then hollowing loud, in raging sport they tear Off from His sacred Head His goodly Hair. 222 One, after three low bowings, on his Knee Humble Petitions brings; and having pray'd His pardon of that Importunity, Flings dirt and mire in's Eyes. Another play'd Ambassador, pretending mighty things He had in charge to Him from neighbour Kings. 223 Most Excellent Sir, my business is, said he, Of such immediate consequence, that it Can no delay digest, but urgeth me To this unwonted and uncivil fit Of craving present Audience: and here He smartly box'd His Ears to make Him hear. 224 A third came with a golden Goblet in, And fawning thus: The Queen to you hath sent This Morning-draught, and prays you to begin, That she may pledge you: suddenly he bent At Jesus's gentle Face his ireful Brow And in His Mouth the Bowl of Urine threw. 225 A fourth His Reed pluck'd from His Hand, and cry'd, Your Scepter, Sir, too heavy is, I fear; Let not your Majesty your Servant chide, If he offend in too much Loyall Care: Your self shall judge how grievous is its weight: Which said, Him with the sturdy Cane he beat. 226 A fifth with earnest supplication su'd For leave, his Princely Train that day to bear; Then snatching up His Robe behind, with rude But eager peevishness, he kick'd Him there; Batt'ring the Body of all Sweetness, till His weary Foot stopp'd his unwearied Will. 227 A sixth came bawling, Treason, Treason, Sir, Treason against your sacred Majesty: Your Jewish Subjects all conspiring are Against your Honor and your Life: O fly, And save your Royal Self. This made them all, Seeing Him bound so fast, a-laughing fall. 228 'Twere endless, Psyche, to describe how they With crabbed wantonness did sneer and pout; How they did wrest their looks; what wry-mouth'd play They us'd, their gentle Savior to flout. The worst of ugly Petulance conceive, And infinitely worse than that believe. 229 This Scene thus acted: Pilate brings Him forth Accouter'd thus, into the People's view: And though no Crime of His appeareth worth The name of Capital; 'tis fit I shew You with what heavy punishment, said He, His light and petty faults revenged be. 230 If this ridiculous Garb seem not enough, With more than killing shame to clothe Him; see What full-tide streams of Blood about Him flow, And guess what favor He hath gain'd from me. Alas, can any further room be found In all His Body, but for one more Wound? 231 Behold the Man; this torn and worryed Thing Is He, how ever Comely heretofore: Sure He has for His foolish Name of King Full dearly pay'd; and of your Credits more Regardful were not I, than of mine own, Such proofs of Cruelty I had not shown. 232 Say now what augmentation of Disgrace Or Anguish, could from any Cross accrue, To that which in His brused batter'd Face, And all-bemangled Flesh you read: 'tis true He lives; but such a joiless Life, as hath All reason to prefer the foulest Death. 233 O spectacle of most commanding sorrows! How would all Hearts, but [fierce] Jews', melt to see These ghastly torrents, and these gasping furrows: The perfect Picture of Calamity! How would a Tyger's thirsty wrath relent! How would the souls of hungry Bears repent! 234 Had these unhappy Miscreants any Eyes, But those of hard'ned Rancor, they might here Have marked how their own sad Miseries To patient Jesus all transferred were, And scor'd upon His Back: they might have found A salve for all their sores in every wound. 235 They might have seen His innocent Temples wear That Malediction, which to them was due: Whilst He the stinging Briars pleas'd to bear, And leave to them the fragrant flowers which grew Both in their Mortal Gardens here, and which With endless Sweets did Paradise inrich. 236 At least that Lesson of Compassion they As well as Pilate, might have plainly read, Which in large Rubrick Letters open lay, And to the eyes of all Spectators spread So fair a challenge, that no generous Breasts Could Pity's importunity resist. 237 But lo, the barbarous Priests, unsatisfy'd With all that sea of Blood already shed, Because some more behind remained: cry'd O ease the Earth of that blasphemous Head, Before Heav'n vindicate it self, and we Involved in the Flood of Vengeance be. 238 Those sorry Gashes, though they glare, are yet Less deep and broad than His Offence: beside All Serpents have the ill-bestowed wit, To lick and heal their wounds, though far more wide Than those of His: and why may pois'nous He Not full as cunning as His Kindred be? 239 Is His a boyish fault, that you should deem A whiping, meet and ample Punishment? O rather square your own by Heav'n's esteem, And join with ours your righteous consent. A Cross, a Cross: Heav'n cannot pleased be, Until this Monster crucify'd it see. 240 This most unreasonable Madness made The Judge as loud as They: Your throat, said He, Shall never roar me to your bloody trade. The Man is guiltless in mine eyes; if ye Resolved are that Innocence must die, Go murder Him your selves, and cease your cry. 241 Harsh was this word, and grated their Design: So hard, that they inforced were to fly To that reserve which they did most decline, As knowing well 'twas an old-answer'd Lye: That Law they now pretend, to which long since The Pris'ner justify'd His Innocence. 242 Nay, they reply'd, It is not We, but Law: Our Law, more dear to us than are our Lives, Requires His Death. May Pilate please to know That our just God no grace, nor pardon gives To (though but faint) Blasphemers; and shall He, Who makes Himself the Son of God, go free? 243 If Thou Protector of our Laws wilt be Break not our greatest for this Varlet's sake. Should He intrude into the Family Of Cesar, and his Heir's great Title take, Sure thou wouldst judge a Cross his due; and is Heav'n's Emperor's Wrong a less Offence than this? 244 Bloodthirsty Hypocrites! who clearly knew, How they their Law in urging it deny'd: Had this most false Impeachment been most true, Yet must not Jesus by the Cross have dy'd; Their Law an heap of Stones ordain'd to be The Death and Monument of Blasphemy. 245 Yet this New-plea stung jealous Pilate so, That he again retires, and tries again What fresh Examination might do: Blind Notions tumbled in his troubled Brain Concerning Heros and Half-gods, which had The solemn Cheats of Pagan Faith been made. 246 For seeing more than human Patience shine In Jesus's strange deportment; he began To think he might be one of Jove's Divine And Sovereign Stock, though masked now in Man: Him therefore he requireth to uncase The truth, and satisfy him whence He was. 247 But to this needless Curiosity Thy sober Lord would no Reply vouchsafe: For whether He from Heav'n His Pedigree Or Earth deriv'd, 'twas evident enough, That Innocence in God or Man, could from A righteous Judge deserve no fatal doom. 248 This Silence spurr'd indignant Pilate's pride: Oft have I spoke for Thee, and yet wilt Thou Not one poor word bestow on me? defy'd Is all my power, said he, by which I now Can bless Thee with a free release, or send Thee on the Cross to make Thy cursed End? 249 But Jesus thus: no power hadst thou to reach My life, but by Heav'n's special private Grant: 'Tis not thy common Jurisdiction which Involveth Me: this makes the Priest who sent Me pris'ner hither, to be plunged in So much the deeper and the fouler Sin. 250 Aw'd by this Answer's gravity, into A piercing sense of His integrity; Th'ingenuous Judge resolves his best to do In setting Him, and his own Conscience free; His utmost prudence he awak'd to treat And into honesty the People cheat. 251 But whilst he signify'd his gentle Mind, Alas, new oil upon their flames he threw; For in their loudest fury all combin'd, Upon Him with this bold Reply they flew; If Jesus you dismiss, We must have leave Great Cesar to acquaint with this Reprieve. 252 Did not that Traitor's Head contrive to wear A Crown of gold, where now those Thorns you see? And who more dangerous foes to Cesar are Than those who would no longer subjects be? He says, His Realm is not on Earth: and what Should Traitors being taken, plead, but that? 253 But were He free again, and had proud He New thousands at His heels, to follow on His Will's Carreer; might His design not be True to our Fears? And will our Judge alone Let loose this danger? surely loyal We Must hold you then for Cesar's Enemy. 254 Drove by this Menace to his Judgment-seat, Behold your King, and mark Him well, said he: Can this poor sorry Wight be thought the great Rival of Cesar? But this honest Plea They thus confute: Away with Him, and let Him pay upon the Cross His Treason's debt. 255 The Cross? in smiling anger Pilate cry'd; Is that the Throne where I must set your King? No King have we, the sullen Priests reply'd, But Cesar: as for this accursed Thing, 'Tis more than time that to His Cross He go, And every one who is His favorer too. 256 The Judge had with their Malice grappled long: But now his Place and Office lay at stake; He who before so righteous was and strong, Hop'd to support himself by turning weak And impious: Nor did the People spare To hasten those strange Hopes whose ground was Fear. 257 This new State-blast on his faint Bosom blew So thick a storm of Jealousy and Dread That now he fancy'd all the City drew Their mutinous Swords against his single Head; And that the Priests had with their specious Lye Dispatch'd to Rome a dangerous Embassy. 258 Thus toss'd and bandy'd by the tempest, He His Faith and Truth, the dearest wares he had, Throws over-board; and to their Cruelty Steers his Consent: which yet appear'd so mad And full of foul and odious horror, that He calls for Water, off to wash its Blot. 259 Why wilt thou ravish, foolish Hypocrite The Virgin Nymph? what Water canst thou get To wash This clean; which cannot make thee white, But only by thy wretched touching it For ever will be stain'd: should all the Sea Flow on thy Hands, they still would bloody be. 260 The Leopard's spots, which fix their feet so sure Upon his skin, shall sooner run away; Sooner the Æthiop's face shall learn a Cure And change its ugly Night to beauteous Day; The Ravens with Swans in white shall sooner vye, Then thou be purg'd from thy ingrained Dye. 261 Yet Pilate flatter'd by his own Device, Will needs be dabling in the Bacin; and Behold, ye Priests and People all, he cries, Of Jesu's blood I wash my guiltless Hand: Though I the Sentence pass, it shall be known You forc'd my tongue, and you the Act must own. 262 Content; and since in it you will not share, Let ours, said they, the Honor wholly be: Both Heav'n and Earth will thank our zealous Care, And safe Tiberius praise our Loyalty. So will your Self, when you have weighed well What kind of Monster you have sent to hell. 263 As for His Blood which frights your timorous Hand, It is to us the brightest paint of Glory, And will to all Succession's eyes commend Our just and pious Resolution's Story: 'Tis our Ambition's highest Wish, that it May on our Heads, and on our Children's sit. 264 Unhappy Wish! had this been rightly fram'd, No Pray'r with purer wings had soard to heaven, Nor pull'd more Blessings, than would have streamed In this rich Blood: But see the monstrous leaven Of holy-looking Malice, which can thus Make sweetest words turn sadly Ominous. 265 For 'twas not long e'r Titus came and pour'd This Flood upon them, and their Wish fulfilled: They and their Heirs together were devour'd, With such full vengeance this red Torrent swelled; Their Town and Temple too the Deluge found, Which in their Wishe's surplusage were drown'd. 266 Wild War did never yet so riot in The veins of any helpless wights, as here; Nor fatal Misery hunt out any Sin With so severe a Quest as that: for their Outragious Wish and bloody Exclamation Tolled the funeral Knell to all their Nation. 267 And now the Judge, within whose breast the fear Of Men, vile Men, much more than God did reign; Those Bonds of generous Right himself does tear From which he woo'd the People to refrain; And ruins all his Honor that he may Secure his tottering Dignity to day. 268 His Roman Boasting's splendid plumes he plucks; To hold it fast, he stains his Master's Sword; His righteous Tenderness, upon the rocks Of Tyranny he breaks; and by one Word Gives all his Protestations the lye, Judging the Lord of Innocence to die. 269 O monstrous Sentence! were the fell Decrees Which ever yet from mouths of Tyrants brake, With all their dismal Pomp of Cruelties, Describ'd in one black Roll; they could not make So hideous a show as This alone Of Barbarousness the dire Perfection. 270 All Injuries in This triumphant are, Skru'd to the highest pitch of rampant Spight: Injustice but a Suckling was, till here She suddenly attain'd her stature's height: Herod indeed had fairly nurs'd her; but Her bulk's full growth by Pilate's help she got. 271 For could all Hell mould up so dire a Doom As might send every Babe who 'gan to see Life's morning light, strait from his Mother's womb To Death's black Ev'n; that Sentence yet would be Less fell than This, which murders at a blow More Innocence than all the World can show. 272 Than This; to which no Copy near shall draw Till Albion with Palestine shall vy; When British Jews against their King a Law Shall find, and make the Rout for Justice cry: When they a Pilate of their own shall get, And desperate Soldiers too, to do the feat. 273 Unfortunate Judge! how rufully hast thou Condemn'd thy timorous Self in dooming Him! The time draws nigh, when Caius will not know Pilate for Cesar's friend; thy dear Esteem And Office, to their fatal evening draw, And Six Years more will make Thee feel the Law. 274 The Law of Banishment; when France shall see Thee to Vienna ty'd in strong Disgrace; Where Hell shall to thy Soul displayed be, And make thy Conscience war against thy face, Mustring the Guilt of this unhappy Day Before thine eyes in terrible array. 275 Thy Ladie's Message there again shall sound, And sting thy heart; thine own Profession's there Of Jesu's Innocence, shall all rebound Upon thy thoughts, and thy Remembrance tear: That mocked Water there shall scald thee, and Revenge its wrong on thy polluted Hand. 276 There shall thy Whips on Thee their Lashes turn; There shall the Thorns plant Tortures on thy head; There to thy self each Stripe and Scoff and Scorn Shall in full tale be duly numbered; There thy prodigious Sentence back shall fly, And point black Pilate out as fit to die. 277 Then shall the cruel Cross, the Nails, the Spear, March through thy thoughts, and slaughter thee alive; Till Crucify'd by thine own fatal fear, Thy Self meet vengeance to thy self shalt give, And from thy Hell above by cursed death Send thy despairing Soul to Hell beneath. 278 So shall thine Hand thou thoughtst thou washt so white, Foully imbru'd in thine own horrid gore, An useful Copy to all Judges write Of what sure Doom Heav'n's righteous Wrath doth pour On them who warp Law's rule to Peoples' Lust, And make the Throne of Justice be Unjust. CANTO XIV. The Death of Love. The ARGUMENT. Love having liv'd for Man, is pleased to Die, To make His Purchase sure by Life and Death; Through Earth's profoundest gulf of Tyranny, And vaster Ocean of Heav'n's mighty Wrath He nobly waded: then upon the shore After His blood, vouchsaf'd His Soul to pour. 1 O Soul of Sweets, O Life, how dear art Thou To all that ever had a Taste of Thee! How much of Heav'n it self triumphs to flow Into the region of Thy Suavity! Indeed Heav'n were not Heav'n, unless it had By marrying Thee the Court of Bliss been made. 2 Thou in the Center of Divinity Before the birth of Ages had'st Thy Spring, Where Thou did'st sweetly smile amidst the Three Most undivided One, and traversing Those heights and depths of glorious Pleasure, through Eternitie's immense Expansion flow. 3 Thence, when the World burst out from Nothing, Thou Let'st out some streams created Souls to cheer; With which sweet Influence when they 'gan to glow, All Bosoms strait of it inamored were; Which as their richest dearest Jewel, in The temple of their Hearts obtain'd its shrine. 4 Goods were no longer Goods, compar'd with Thee; Parents and Children were no more of kin, If they disturb'd thy Consanguinity: Their tenderer Selves, though lying treasur'd in The bosom of their Love, they thence would throw, Counting no Wives so near them as wert Thou. 5 For Thy sweet sake they durst rejoice to bear All Bitterness, and not to blush at Shame: Their Joints, Limbs, Skin, they readily could spare, Yea and allow their precious Name and Fame. A prey to Injury, so they by them May Thee and Thy Security redeem. 6 The vilest Worm whom Thou dost please to grace, Forgets not that high Worth he gains by Thee: He shoots his warey self from place to place, And, when oppressed, feeble though he be, He turns again, and with the strongest Fo Tries what for Thy dear Rescue he can do. 7 Rather on basest Dust the Snake will feed His wretchedness, than part with precious Thee; Though Heav'n's sad Curse sits heavy on his head, He makes his body all one helmet be To shelter it; and rolls himself about Himself, to keep all mortal bruses out. 8 Nay when the Sword, or Wand Death's way has cut Quite through his circles, till his carcase be In its own woful fragments buried, yet Ev'n by the cement of his Wounds will he Soder himself; so loth is he to die, Though Life him Pris'ner holds to Misery. 9 What voyages will silly Swallows take Warm courteous Seasons round the World to chase! How hard a shift will hunted Pheasants make To shun the greedy Griffen's deadly face! What wings of speed, what tricks and sleights will Fear Of dying, teach the close-persued Hare! 10 In how great sweat and pains will Pismires spend Their warmer months, to reap and carry home Their crop, which in the Cold may them befriend With sustentation, and protect them from The fear of loosing that poor Life which they In love of it, to endless Toil betray. 11 The most industrious never-tired Bee Flies through all Summer, knocking at the door Of every likely Flower, where thoughtful she Can borrow ought to help her Winter's store: And thus for love of Life, her honey-Trade A bitter task of Painfulness is made. 12 Yea ev'n the simplest Weed, whose Life doth but Preserve that Stink by which she taints the air; When Boreas 'gins his icey chains to put On captiv'd Earth, makes all her Spirits repair Down to the Root: for, rather than be dead, Alive she chooseth to be buryed. 13 But yet no Creature with such painful pains Doth hunt out Life's security, as Man: What Projects tumble in his anxious brains, What Cares and Labours make him faint and wan! Earth all things else can freely entertain, But he must sow before he reap his grain. 14 A tedious Prenticehood he spends, to learn How he may toil himself another day, And by his still-returning Studies earn His wasting strength's support; that still he may Be grapling with his growing Work; his Sweat Being the constant Sauce to all his Meat. 15 To get a Living's a sufficient Charm To lure him through the most portentuous Sea; To make his Weakness scorn th'outragious Storm; To harden him above the durity Of desperate Rocks: for, that he still may breath, He dares within three inches live of death. 16 A Charm sufficient to make him list Himself a foe unto the Life of Man, Whilst he triumphs to make his stoney breast Yet more obdurate by bold steel, and can Without all blushing take his bloody Pay For his endeavours daily to Destroy. 17 Sufficient to engage him in the love Of Hate, and Spight, and Fraud, and Rapine, and Any accursed Helps which may improve His stock of Avarice; to make him stand Stiff on the mountain-top of Villanies Defying Vengeance, and the thundring Skies. 18 O wonderous Riddle! though eternal Death Inevitably be entail'd upon His wicked Life; yet he his present breath Esteems so dear, as forward still to run In any deadly Crimes, to spin on that Weak thread of Days which must e'r long be cut. 19 Indeed the Man whose teeming Coffers bring Him forth free choise of all the dainty Store With which the Land or Sea can court a King, May find some feeling reason to adore His jolly Life: but what convincing plea Can Beggers move to this Idolatry? 20 Yet sorry they, so destitute within And poor without, that equally they want Both what should line and fill their wretched skin, And what should cover it; are well content On these hard terms to live, nor quit would be By any Death of this Calamity. 21 The buried Captive, whose dark Dungeon is His anti-dated and his sadder Grave, Though banish'd thus from vital Happiness, Yet hugs his Life as dearly, as the brave And freest Gallant who his Lust can please With all the Fat of Pleasure and of Ease. 22 The Leper, clothed in his winding sheet By his Disease, abhors the thought of Death; Life still is ev'n in his dead body sweet; And full as precious he reputes his breath As lovely Virgins, whose fair Features' dress Of native Roses, and of Lilies is. 23 He whom a Fever's furnace fries, would yet Escape the being cooled in his Grave; And hires Physitians' costly doubtful wit To find some way, though painful, now to save His torturing Life: not for a world would he By Death's most sovereign Physick eased be. 24 He whom a Cancer gnaws, had rather feed That Monster, than the Worms; nor sticks to buy Wounds, Cauterisms, Dismembrings; and be dead In part, a mangled life a while to try. On piteous Stilts he'l rather choose to creep Than in a sumptuous tomb lie down to sleep. 25 The lamentable Gally-slave, who fast Is chained to perpetual Misery, Still toils and rows against the Tempest's blast Without all hopes that any Port can be His hav'n of Rest; yet holds that Life full dear Which only makes his bondage persevere. 26 She whom a Siege begirts so close, that She Is crowded up to nought but bones and skin; Shrinks further yet from gaining Liberty By Death's assistance; and will rather win Upon her bowels to devour her Child Than be by Famin of that Life beguild. 27 The cursed Traytor fettered alive In Death's strong iron chair; though sadly sure Abandon'd he in vain for Life shall strive; Yet will in mighty love of it endure To feed on his own Arms, that so he may Though by selfe-torture, live one other day. 28 He who disjointed on the Rack doth lie, Though now his shatter'd Life be scarcely his, After a thousand deaths, is loth to die; And ne'r-thought Treasons willing to confess: Confess he will what needs must be his death, Only to gain a little longer breath. 29 Thus all the Gall that sharpest Misery Into the heart of Mortal Life can pour, Meets there such resolute Powers of suavity As conquer all its Bitterness; such store Of precious mystick Delicacies as Eas'ly outweigh the heavyest Sorrow's mass. 30 Tear what you will from Man besides, and he Will stoutly set his shoulders to sustain The Loss; but if his Life attacked be, In vain all Comforts fawn on him; in vain Are Crowns and Scepters proffer'd him, a price Too poor to hire him to his Obsequies, 31 Since then the Life ev'n of the meanest Wight Scorns to be ballanc'd with the richest Treasure; What depth of mightiest Worthiness, what height Of most refin'd preciousness can measure The value of the Life of Jesus, which Doth Earth with all the best of Heav'n inrich. 32 A Life more worth than was the Breath which fann'd The panting Hearts of all the World beside; More worth than all the tract of Ages, and Old Time it self: A Life which nobly vy'd With vast Eternity, though not in space, Yet in unbounded Excellence and Grace. 33 For whilst all Human Life besides, the breath Of Eden's venomous Serpent tainted so, That by the rankling Principles of Death It from its cradle was condemned to Its herse; His kept it self unstained, and Defy'd the gaping Grave's unjust Demand. 34 And well it might, as having gain'd a pitch Higher than Human, by the Mystery Of Theanthropick Combination, which Peerless Prerogative's sublimity Did Infinite with Finite strangely wed, And make it both the Life of Man and God. 35 Yet this dear Life of His, less dear He held Than worthless Man: so generous was His Love His royal Heart's last Blood He freely spill'd To ransom Theirs; desiring so to prove Ev'n by their Soul's own rule, that They to Him More worth than His all-precious Self did seem. 36 They, and the worst of them: nor did He choose And pick some Noble Friends, for whose sweet sake His Life to offer up; but for His Foes Vouchaf'd that dear Oblation to make: Resolv'd that their ingrateful Hate should be Drown'd in vast Courtesy's profoundest Sea. 37 O most adorable and matchless Art Of Strange Revenge! what Enemy is he Whose sweetly-wounded and convinced heart Triumpheth not to be subdu'd by thee! By thee, Love's highest Gallantry, and fit For Him who is the mighty King of it! 38 With this divine Exploit her Guardian now To ravish Psyche's plyant Soul, went on: (The wonderous Legend though before she knew, Yet 'twas at distance; Circumstances can Make deep impression, and the present Scene Of Miracles more admiration win.) 39 No sooner to the Shambles sentenc'd thus Was Heav'n's pure Lamb; but streight upon their Prey The rampant Soldiers fly: His gorgeous Attire away they snatch, and Him array In His own simple Fleece, (yet suff'ring still The stinging Thorns upon His Head to dwell.) 40 Thus rubb'd, and wounded all those Wounds again, Whose weary Blood had 'gan its clotted rest; This op'd the worry'd mouth of every Vein, Which though so strictly urg'd, yet confest, Not all they knew; resolved still to keep Enough the Cross in Ruby paint to steep. 41 Thus, dress'd for further spight, to Calvary They hurry Him, ev'n though their Senate's Law Wisely provides no Execution be Done, till by ten days' thoughts the Judge may know Whether his Sentence more by Passion's haste, Than slow-pac'd Reason's Rules he has not past. 42 The Priests had Money, that commanding spur Which fires all Soldiers with impatient speed; And Pilate now can cast in no Demur; The Jewish Casuists tell him there's no need: But need, or not; in vain his Fancies beat; The Soldiers now were bought to do the Feat. 43 Yet being Martial generous Spirits, they Must not debase their armed Backs to bear The servile ignominious Cross; nor may The holy Jews, who purified were To keep their blessed Paschal Supper, be Stain'd by the touch of that accursed Tree. 44 On Jesus's wounds His Death the Soldiers lay, And He must earn His Cross's Service by First bearing it: then hasting Him away, They 'gin their march; thus with a barbarous cry Of Tongues and Trumpets, which the welkin rent, Through Salem's Streets this sad procession went. 45 But He whose Springs so drained were before Of Blood and Spirits, feeble grew and faint: In vain they kick Him, and in vain they tore Him forward by His Hair; for no constraint Can screw weak Nature into strength, or breed Robustuous Firmness in a broken Reed. 46 Easy indeed and light His Burden is: But that's not this Himself was pleas'd to bear: For though His bloody Yoke did grind and press Him to the ground, He lays upon His dear And faithful Followers no weight, but such As helps them up Heav'n's lofty gate to reach. 47 What Heart not seared by the fire of Hell, Could now Compassion's yearning tears repress? But these rude Sons of Mars are by the fell Cantagion of the Jewish Salvageness So deeply tainted, that what might invite Panthers to pity, only whets their Spight. 48 For meerly in prevention of the Loss Of that choice sport their hopes had fram'd, when He Should fairly yield them mounted on His Cross A steady Mark, at which all scoffs might be Directly aim'd; they from this Load reprieve Him, And force Cyrenian Simon to relieve him. 49 Nay Live, good Sir, you shall, till you may Die As you deserve: mean while this Earnest take Of that full sum, which we will by and by On Golgotha without abatement make: Which said, they slash'd Him, and so much the more, As with His Blood He no Complaints would pour. 50 Indeed the softer sex, attending Him And His still-growing woes with tenderer eyes, In His own Blood could not behold Him swim, But with their sympathetick Tears and Cries Confess'd that Women still had Bowels, though Remorsless stone Men's Hearts did overgrow. 51 But Jesus, who had all this grievous while Encourag'd by His patient silence those Most spightful Tempest[s] belched by the vile And loudly-railing Jews; doth now oppose These Women's loving showers, and turn on them With nobler Pity their own pitying stream. 52 For 'twas His brave Ambition to engross All griefs and sorrows to Himself to day; Esteeming every groan of their's His loss, And all His woes disparaged, if they Intruded thus, and must His Partners be In this calamitous Monopoly. 53 Weep not ye Daughters of Jerusalem, Weep not for Me, who ope have set My Breast To every Anguish which can hither stream, And heartily will welcome every guest: Weep not for Me, said He, whose sorrows are Not to be quenched by a mortal Tear. 54 If you will broach your Bottles, let them run Both for your selves, and your unhappy seed; Those lamentable Days are posting on Which all your brine, and more than all will need; The Days when Blessing shall no longer spread Its joyous Complement on Mothers' Head. 55 The barren Womb shall then applauded be As fertile in the choisest Happiness; All Tongues shall then those Paps' aridity Which ne'r nurs'd up a Prey for slaughter, bless: Then shall the dearest Pledges of your Love, Your Sons and Daughters, living torments prove. 56 Then in impatient longing for a Grave, Despairing Men shall to the Mountains call, And every neighbour Hill's compassion crave, Beseeching them upon their Heads to fall, And hide them, though in Death, from seeing what Perplexity shall through the World be shot. 57 For if in Me, a young and verdant tree The flames of vengeance thus prevailing are; What dismal Doom shall executed be On stumps and trunks, all withered and sear, And ready-dry'd, and fuel fit indeed Only their own combustion to feed. 58 Strait, in a fresh blaspheming cursing fit This set the frantick Rout; who ask'd Him, Why When they of late so humbly begged it He would not condescend to prophesy? And why His entheous Tongue could not as well His own, as others' misery, foretell? 59 And see, good Prophet, yonder Hill, said they; Be sure you take before too late it prove, Your own advice: let's hear what you can say, Both its Compassion, and it self, to move. Set out your throat; if hard and loud you plead, Perhaps 'twill bow its own to hide your Head. 60 Nay, use your strongest Rhetorick; and know It mightily concerns you to prevail: For your arrested Life and Credit now Nothing but that great Miracle can bail; Since if that Hill comes not to you, by Fate It is decreed, that you must go to that. 61 Then having star'd a while upon Him, all Whose Fists, or Toes, or Spittle Him could reach, With thick and peevish indignation fall Upon His brused bloody Body: which Variety of Scorns He vanquish'd by Meek Silence; and march'd up to Calvary. 62 This Calvary, where now we standing are, Which from a Scull deriv'd its solemn Name; Adam's discover'd Scull, whose Sepulchre Was digged here: which secret careful Fame Told to posterity, and so the Hill Wears in its Title that old story still. 63 With such Decorum did thy prudent Lord His meritorious Passion order, that The Second Adam might His help afford, To free the First where chain'd he lay and shut In Death's dark Jayl,—the most remorsless Grave,— To worms, and stinks, and putrifaction slave. 64 Jesus on that dry Dust contriv'd to shed His sovereign and purifying Blood; That He might wash and cure the tainted Head Of deadly miseries ev'n by the Flood Of His own Life; that Life which only can Restore true vital vigor unto Man. 65 Here, here the Cross's steady foot was set, When up it bare the World's Supporter; here Is that renowned Soil, which once was wet With richer Drops than ever shoured were From kindest Heav'n; that potent fertile Dew, By which Mature Salvation's Harvest grew. 66 But yet this Hill wears not that only Name Of Calvary; 'twas call'd Moriah too, When Heav'n-commanded Abraham hither came His dearer Self to sacrifice, and so By that unparallel'd Obedience prove The valorous Bravery of Faithful Love. 67 He hither came, and built his Altar here, Which pre-possest the nobler Crosse's seat; So Isaac did thy Lord's a while: yet there A snarled Ram untwisted Isaac's fate; But no Vicegerent here, no Ram alas Which might of God's own Lamb supply the place. 68 That fatal Hour of Darkness, Psyche, now Was come, which in the hand of Tyranny Left free the reins; and she her freedom knew: That Hour, when Innocence by Heav'n's Decree Became surrendred, and abandon'd quite To feed the Luxury of hungriest Spight. 69 'Tis true, His Lips were complemented by A draught of Wine; but ah, the Complement Cruelly mock'd Him by the treachery Of Bitterness, which made His Taste repent. Besides, He had resolv'd to swallow down No blood of Grapes, till He had shed His own. 70 His worryed limbs forthwith the Soldiers stretch To fit Him to His wide tormenting Tree: Up to the top His blessed Hands they twitch, Those Hands which made them; and as violently They to the bottom draw His Feet, which clear Of all but their own guiltless Purple were. 71 These Hands and Feet with salvage Nails they make Ah sadly sure, and rivet Him into His Pains and Death. What heart-strings would not crack To see these tender veins broke open? Who Could barbarize his eyes to keep their flood At home, now those dear Torrents run abroad? 72 Sure none who dare the Name of Softness wear, The name of Christian, can this Story read With hearts so stony, but these Nails will tear Their Thoughts, and make their Contemplations bleed: For how can living genuine Members be Not wounded with their Head's Calamity. 73 But these inhumane Torturers shouting loud In desperate applause of this their Sin, Rear up the Trophy of their rage, with proud Delight to see their Victory. So when Harpyes on heaps have heap'd their butcher'd Prey, They smile, and clap their wings for cursed joy. 74 So when the Prince of monstrous Barbarousness Abimelech, had seav'nty breaches in The Bands of Nature made; by murdering his Envy'd but harmless Brethren; on his Sin The Fabrick of his high Content he built, And measured his Triumph by his Guilt. 75 This done; on either hand a noted Thief They crucify; by these Companions so To cheat the foolish World into belief That He of equal Crimes was guilty too. Alas, He knew no other Theft but this, To steal His Torturers to heav'nly Bliss. 76 For whilst between these Bryers, like the Rose, Or beauteous Virtue 'twixt her foul Extremes, He nailed is; He plots to save His Foes, And projects how to pay them Diadems For these His Tortures: unto Heav'n He flies On Love's stout wings, and to His Father cries: 77 Father! by all the Sweets of that dear Name, Regard the Prayer of Thy dying Son: By this My Cross, and all its noble Shame, By these four Wounds which with full current run; By all these Thorns which on My Temples grow, And sharper those which pierce My Bosom through: 78 Behold not Thou the Sin of these poor Men, Since they themselves perceive not what they do; Though foolish, yet they are My Brethren: O spare them then! Let not their Error who Occasion all the World's most sovereign Bliss, Make their own souls their proper portion miss. 79 Though blind, 'tis Zeal: the Blindness O forgive, And teach their Zeal henceforth to use its eyes: Why hang I here, if not for their Reprieve Whose Wickedness most needs this Sacrifice? Since I to drink Thy Fury ready am, O make it not a Potion for Them. 80 Thus deign'd the Lamb for ravening Wolves to pray, The Partridge for the Hawks. O mighty Love Which all the Wrongs of this most barbarous Day Cannot repress! the more the Caytifs strove To wreak upon Him their elaborate Spight, The more on them He tries His Mercie's Might. 81 Thus let Arabian Odours brused be, Their sweet revenge they on their Enemies take By pouring out to them their treasury Of pure Perfumes; whose Breaths no anger speak, But in the Language of delicious Sent And that alone, are kindly eloquent. 82 Thus when the tender Vine is nailed fast About her Prop, and by the pruning Knife Robb'd of her Limbs; she taketh no distaste At all those deep intrenchments on her life, But with a bounteous Vintage strives to chear The heart of him who wounds and mangles her. 83 But what care retchless they, who scorn to be By Kindness softned? Wax indeed may run, Warm'd by the Touch of Highnoon's charity; But sordid Mud although the courteous Sun With free and ful-tide Raies about it flows, In stead of Melting only harder grows. 84 More need they think that Jesus has to Pray For's Self, than Them; and smiling with disdain At His unask'd-for Intercession, they High time now count it to divide their Gain: This was His Clothes, the Lamb's poor plunder'd fleece, The simple prize of their bold Villanies. 85 His other Robes they severally share: But since His larger Vesture's texture was Intire and seamless, they contented are To offer the decision of the case To Fortune's sentence, and conclude by Lot To give that whole they thought too good to cut. 86 Too good they thought this Common-web to be Mangled and slash'd; yet with the self-same Heart Abhorred not His precious Flesh to see Gashed, and plow'd, and rent in every part. Rude Butchers thus think fit the Skin to keep Untorn, although they quarter out the Sheep. 87 But now thy Lord was seated on His Throne, Of pangs, His Royal style above His Head, By Pilate fixed is; and, though but one, Yet in three Languages decyphered; The Learned three; that all the World might learn The Mystery which did their Life concern. 88 Indeed the Highpriest's Stomach's rose, and pray'd The Judge to write Him but pretended King: But he, by Heav'n or Conscience oversway'd, Their peevish suit away sullenly flung. To make His wronged Person some amends, Thy Saviour's Title stoutly he defends. 89 Mean while arrayed in His naked Gore, Sweet Jesus sadly hangs 'twixt Heav'n and Earth, Of both rejected; yet doth freely pour The World's red price at four wide floodgates forth: An object of more Pity never yet Exposed was, nor reaped less of it. 90 All Passengers without Regard went on, And turn'd their careless backs upon His sorrow: Which surely upon theirs had Jesus done, Alas, they must themselves have waded thorough The Ocean of tempestuous Pangs, nor had He in their stead this woful voyage made. 91 Yet well it were, if only this Neglect Made war upon His Patience; if His Foes To heedless sleighting and cold Disrespect No busy active Malice join'd: But those Ingenious Sons of Mischief still devise New tricks and ways afresh to tyrannize. 92 For not contented with their Nails and Thorns To dig His precious Body, now they strive To pierce His Soul with ignominious scorns, To wound His Meekness, and His Suff'rings grieve: His bloody Cross cannot their spight suffice, Unless He mocked and reviled dies. 93 They point their Fingers, and their Heads they shake; And then their crueller Tongues, and thus they cry: Remember what your Pride once pleas'd to crack; You could both ruin and re-edify That Pile in three days' space: yet, mighty Sir, The Temple stands, and You are hanged here. 94 For shame make good your boasted Power, and now Shake from your Hands, kick from your Feet the Nails; Command the Cross before your face to bow; Call home your stragling Blood; close at your Heels Destruction hunts: high time it is to save Your self, if you design to scape your grave. 95 O no; the Elders, Scribes, and Priests reply, Though many seeming Wonders He hath done; Though cured many an ugly Malady: Though strangely conjur'd up Salvation For others: yet 'tis certain, wretched He Can never to Himself a Saviour be. 96 No cheating lying Prophet e'r was known, Who once into the hands of Justice brought, Could by his highest Witchcraft reach his own Deliverance, and work his Carcass out Of Chains or Tortures: for if this might be, Who could distinguish Truth from Forgery? 97 Now it appears by whose assistance He Breath'd with His Word that Nature-conquering strength Which charm'd the People's fond Credulity. But Belzebub is wise enough at length To leave his Instrument to Justice, when Through all his Task of Mischief He has run. 98 Now Pilate finds how little cause he had To shake his Head at our importunate Cry: Had not our Zeal that fervent Onset made On his abused Lordship's Lenity, This rank Impostor, then reprieved, might Have pass'd still for a Wonder-working Wight. 99 Yet if the potent King of Israel now Will deign to stoop from that unkingly Tree, And to His Subjects' doubtful hearts allow This proof of His Divine Supremacy; For our parts, we are ready here, and will Believe His Pow'r, and His Commands fulfil. 100 What can He more expect from Us, who are Attending on Him in His deepest Shame, And wait till He will please those Mists to clear, Which damp the lustre of His glorious Name? So fain our homage we to Him would pay, Would He assert Himself, and ope our way. 101 But silly King, nor hand nor foot can He Stir, though His Kingdom lyeth at the stake; He talk'd as if the Clouds His Coach should be, And that upon the Air's commanded back, He'd ride into our view: yet now, alas, We find His sorry Charet's but His Cross. 102 He oft was heard to brag of God His Sire: How is it then His Father owns him not? Sure were He worth the Owning, all the Quire Of Heav'n, would bring their Wings to hide this Blot Of His so broad, so deep Disgrace, and hence In triumph carry home their Native Prince. 103 Shame on your blasphemously-shameless Tongue, Unpriestly Priests: for Jesus aimeth not To free Himself, but You who flout and sting His noble Patience. He has not forgot That Truly-sovereign He holds treasur'd in His Hands Omnipotence's Magazine. 104 For those Almighty Hands He stretcheth out, Are busied in working your Salvation. He could Come down; but stays till He has wrought The mighty Act of his victorious Passion. He could Come down; but His Design is now Up after Him all groveling Men to draw. 105 He could Come down; did you not fix Him there, Not with your Nails, but with your stronger sins. He could Come down; were but His Life as dear To Him as yours: but on His Wrongs He wins, And by Love's indefatigable Might Strives to subdue the utmost spight of spight. 106 Down should He come; ye foolish Miscreants how Could you get up the Hill of Heav'nly Bliss! Down should He come; how desperately low Would you and all the World be tumbled! this Your Exaltation is, and not His own, Who Condescendeth by not Coming down. 107 O Psyche, barbarous were those scoffs: but yet More stinging Ignominy's still behind; For now the putid Thieves upon Him spit Their odious taunts, and seem in Him to find What their vile Souls amidst the Miseries Of their own cursed Crosses, dare despise. 108 Ink scorns the Snow, foul Night upbraideth Day, The virgin Spring deflowred Puddles mock, Dark Shades contemn the Sun's Meridian Ray, The Swan by Rav'ns is hooted at as black, Blind sneaking Bats reproach the Eagle's Eyes, And Hell it self insults o'r Paradise. 109 Art Thou that mighty Christ, said they, and yet Hang'st here the patient Game of Shame and Spight? Can Heav'n's great Son so far Himself forget, As rather to endure to Die, than Fight? Discredit not the Lord of Hosts, if He Thy Father be, by yielding cowardly. 110 Come, justify that Royal Title there, Which now but laughs at Thine ignoble Head: Approve Thy self the Jewish King, and tear Thy Fame and Life from Ruin's jaws: but spread Thy Favour too on us, that under Thee The Sovereign, we may glorious Nobles be. 111 For since in these Thy deep misfortunes we Of all the World Thy sole Companions are; We well in Thy restor'd Prosperity May promise our Desert the deepest share: 'Tis true, we 're Thieves: but such a one we hear Was Judas too; yet your Lord Treasurer. 112 And reason good: since Thieves and Murderers now Are Names of Credit grown: did not our Nation Elect Barabbas, reprobating You? Although in pangs, sweet Sir, be not in passion. So scoffed they; and then they roar'd for pain; But quickly fell to mock and curse again. 113 And shall not Heav'n's Artillery now attend Its injur'd King? Can Earth this Language hear, And her indignant Mouth not open rend Into Damnation's Gulph these Elves to tear? No: Jesus still no Vengeance can approve But that of patient and silent Love. 114 Sweet Vengeance! which so strongly wrought upon One of this loud blaspheming Pair, that he Converts his Curses to Devotion, And prompts his Fellow-thief to Piety; Rebuking sharply his outrageous Tongue, Which still persu'd his Lord with shameless wrong. 115 We only are the proper Fruit, saith he, Of these accursed Trees, whose Root is Sin: For how did Jesse's Branch deserve to be Torn from His Royal Stock, and grafted in To that vile Trunk! O score no Blot on His Account, who purer than the Lilies is. 116 If e'r thou mean'st to have a sense of God, 'Tis time, high time, before thy Senses fail: Though Standers-by feel nothing of His Rod, Thy present Tortures may with thee prevail; They leisure have to flout, so hast not thou Who on Damnation's brink art tottering now. 117 Then like a wise and sober Thief indeed, He seeks to steal into his Saviour's Grace: Great King of Heav'n, he cries, I plainly read Thy Majesty though in Thy clouded Face. Thy Goodness taught mine Eyes this skill; O then Let Mercy finish what she hath begun. 118 When in Thy Kingdom Thou shalt mounted be Upon Thy Throne of Glory, O forget Those Wrongs my Ignorance hath pour'd on Thee, On Thee, the God of Innocence: but yet Forget not Me, whom greater pangs must grieve Than these, unless Thy Pity me reprieve. 119 Jesus, whose Goodness never yet disdain'd To hear the humble suppliant Sinner's cry, Though His provoked Lips themselves refrain'd In those loud storms of scornful Blasphemy; With gracious sweetness now assurance gave Unto the dying Thief, that he should live. 120 Though thou to Death's dark door art drawing nigh, Ev'n that shall prove the gate of Life to thee; My Word, the pillar of all Certainty, To thee I pawn: Thou from that cursed Tree Stepping to Paradise's bow'rs to day, Thy Head with me on Bliss's bed shalt lay. 121 The Priests and People loudly laugh'd to hear Him talk of giving Bliss, who hung in Pain; Blind fools, who could not now discern how clear His Power shin'd, which from Hell's jaws could gain So strange a Prize, and by Love's mild constraint Make of a cursing Thief a praying Saint. 122 By this dear Token He to every one Of them, aforehand did their Pardon seal, If they, what now the humble Thief had done, Would to His Grace with broken hearts appeal: But wretched They this tender deep Design Of Love, by obstinacy countermine. 123 Profoundly did this Scorn of Mercy tear His most divinely-gentle breast. But He Spying His precious virgin-Mother there, And virgin-Friend, of this His Tragedy The sad Spectators: lo, a double dart Of fresh Grief shot quite through His bleeding heart. 124 For in His Mother's wounded Soul He saw That Sword now sheathed which old Simeon In Prophesy had drawn; and though no Throw She felt at first in bringing forth her Son; For Him she now in hard hard Labour strains, And pays her debt of puerperial Pains. 125 O how the bowels of her yearning Heart Are rent and torn, although untouch'd. How she Profoundly griped is with distant smart, And made a Sacrifice to sympathy! For from her Son she feeleth every wound On her soft self most heavily rebound. 126 A siege of Thorns now hedge her Temples in, To Tortures nailed are her Hands and feet, Tatter'd and mangled is her dainty skin, Her flesh plow'd up, Her veins wide open set, And all her modest Body to the view Exposed is of every shameless Jew. 127 On her those spightful Taunts and Blasphemies Their venome spew, and swell with grief her Breast; That Breast which noble Love so strictly ties And cements to her Son's, that not the least Division can interpose, or make This Double one themselves for single take. 128 If she had in her other self, if she In Mary had been Crucify'd, the Cross Had seem'd a finite Sorrow; but to be Destroy'd in Jesus, is so vast a Loss As knows no limits, being stretched forth By His incomparable boundless Worth. 129 Her Hope, her Joy, her Life, her Love, her Bliss, Her Heav'n, her Son, her God, all these she now Abandon'd sees to deadly Enemies; And what has Mary more? How shall she row Through this fierce Sea, which in each gaping Wave Presents her O how much more than a Grave! 130 Were any Port in ken which might invite And cheer her tempest-broken Hopes; or did The courtesy of any Pharus's light This Ocean of Blackness check; her head She still with courage might have rear'd: but now All Heav'n is dark above, all earth below. 131 As oft as to the Cross she opes her eyes, Death rusheth in; yet she as oft do's die As to their strong Compassion she denies That ruful Spectacle. Alas had I, Or any Seraph, by Grief's armies so Beleaguer'd been and storm'd, what could we do! 132 What but surrender! yet most noble She Strugling amidst a thousand Deaths, at last Snatch'd from her mighty Losses, victory, Whilst at the feet of God's great Will she cast Her own: as gallant Abraham, when He Preferr'd before his Isaac, Piety. 133 Yet what was Isaac unto Jesus! O With how much dearer Prize did Mary part! Though Isaac precious was, he could not so Profoundly be ingrav'd in Abraham's heart, As He in Mary's: yet content is she Ev'n of her heart's own Heart depriv'd to be. 134 O Heav'nly Mother! never Agony Was more heroical than this of thine; Except thy Son's, when in the Garden He His bloody humane Patience prov'd Divine: And all Decorum 'twas, that next the Son The Mother, Glory's hardest race should run. 135 But Psyche, though this Amazon of Love So stoutly fought; yet John, whose valor's metal Was of a britler temper, could not prove Himself so strong in this Distresse's battle: He strove a while with hearty fervor, but Poor Saint, at length he found the fight too hot. 136 For whilst his eyes dwelt sadly on that Breast Upon whose Sweets his head was wont to lie; And those dear Arms, which us'd to hug him fast And chain him into Bliss; the Tyranny Which now on them had seized, overthrew His melting Soul, and all his Comforts slew. 137 He wonder'd what the virgin Mother meant Whose Hopes dar'd live, ev'n whilst her Life was dying; And on what bottom stood that strange Content The fall of Joy's foundation defying: For his part, bow he must to sad Dismay Since with his Lord his Heart a bleeding lay. 138 Jesus observ'd them Both; and saw how She Although her Sorrows far the mightier were, Compell'd them to her Will to stoop; how He Yielded, and let the Tempest domineer Through all his conquer'd breast: and seeing this, Felt what He saw in Both, for Both were His. 139 He felt their Tortures; but with deeper sense Than they themselves, and more Excess of pain: His Soul was temper'd to the Excellence Of daintiest softness, and could not refrain Its bowels from resenting all the Darts He spy'd in any of His Spouse's hearts. 140 Witness His tender Care before he dies, To cheer them by a bounteous Legacy: His Mother, far above all Jewels' price, Ev'n in that dearest of Relations, He To John bequeaths; and mutually John To her, and that no other than as Son. 141 Sweet Legacy! where though the Mother be The richer Gift, if valued alone; Yet is the balance poised equally Now John's inhanced by the name of Son; A Name intitling him alone to be (O wonderous honor!) Jesu's Deputy. 142 A long-long hour had now run out, since by His weeping Wounds the King of Mercy hung: Yet from the staring People's stony eye He of compassion not one drop had wrung: This made the Sun, though on his high-noon throne, Doubt his own eyes had not their duty done. 143 But looking wistly, he discover'd that Bold Men had exil'd all Humanity: Which sight a Blush through all his count'nance shot In shame and horror at the Prodigy: He blush'd, and shut his royal eyes, and hurl'd More than Cimmeria on the guilty World. 144 Though Earth refuse, yet will the Heav'ns at least In mourning Weeds their dying Lord attend, And with no gaudy tire of Light be drest Now all the Powers of Hell and Darkness bend Their uncontrolled spight, in Him to damp All other lights' divine original Lamp. 145 The Air was daunted at this monstrous Change, When Midnight boldly ravish'd Highnoon Day, Marching with gloomy Spectres, and with strange Phantoms of dusky fire, in fierce array; Whilst every hollow Wind which passed by, Groand and bemoan'd this sad Calamity. 146 The lesser Sparks of Heav'n all started at Their sudden privilege, who now might view The open face of Noon; and marvell'd what Had thrown upon the Sun his sable Hue: With doubting twinckling eyes on Him they gaze At once both down, and in his highest place. 147 Each gentle fair-condition'd Bird and Beast Hy'd them into their nests and dens for fear: Only some ominous Ravens and Scritchowls thrust Their sooty pinions through the swarthy air; And to the Jews, their fellow-monsters, croke; Who little thought what fatal things they spoke. 148 Dismays and frights walk'd not so thick upon The muffled face of Memphis, when the mad Egyptians were by vengeance over-run, And in a three-days' Night lay buried. Amaz'd stood Nature, and began to doubt Her Life, now she beheld her Light put out. 149 The grave Astronomers, who with Titan were Of old acquaintance, and knew all his Gifts, His Way, his Inns, his Hosts, and wheresoe'r His restless Coach in his bright road persists; Quite lost themselves to find what Prodigies Had plunder'd him both of his Locks and Eyes. 150 None could suspect the Moon as guilty; She Knew not the business, being far away; No less than half the Heav'n's immensity Betwixt Hers and her Brother's station lay; For whilst He flourish'd in the perfect Height Of Day, he groveled in the Depth of Night. 151 Yet granting some portentuous Wheel had from Her due and proper Place thus whirl'd her; say How could her pety bulk usurp the room Of his vast flames, and dam up all the Day. Sure Phebus scorns that her small Blot should rob The total Beauties of his mighty Globe. 152 O no! a larger Blot it was then so: A Blot where Blackness all its powers combines, A Blot to which the Ink is Alpine Snow, A Blot compounded of all ugliest Sins, A Blot as hideous, as profound, as wide As Impudence could make; 'twas Deicide. 153 No wonder now Heav'n would not viewed be By those who slaughtered her King; or that Just Phebus his less reverend Majesty Deny'd to desperate them who blushed not Thus to eclipse and quench that Soverain Sun Whose open eyes his durst not gaze upon. 154 Yet this dire Darkness but the shadow was Of that more monstrous Pitch which stuck upon The blinded Jews' obdurate hearts: alas This Prodigy's stern admonition Could not awake their sober thoughts to see How frighted Day abhorr'd their Cruelty. 155 The itching Wit of their immortal Spight Detorteth all things into Blasphemy: Behold, say they, the most audacious might Of His unsufferable Witchery; Whilst other Wizzards only on the Moon Or Stars throw darkness, how He chokes the Sun. 156 The Sun He chokes, and fondly hopeth by New Villany to hide that shame to which His former Crimes are nail'd: yet still the Eye, The higher Eye of Heav'n, to Him can reach; And so can ours, however cunning He Before He gains His grave would buried be. 157 His Goblings came too late: a pretty Trick Women and Boys to scare; but He, 'tis thought, Has met with Men. Thus belched they their thick Insulting scoffs: yet still they cast about Their doubtful Eyes, and in their count'nance spread A pale confession of their guilty Dread. 158 But, Psyche, now the Day's Ninth hour drew on This Tragedy's last Act to represent; That most amazing Hour, in which alone More Horrors than all Ages' vast extent Had e'r beheld, and ru'd, together met, And in array themselves all armed set. 159 His other Griefs but dim Preludiums were; And gathering Clouds, in which the storm was bred; But now grown ripe, that storm in full carreer Broke down and sous'd directly on His Head. Thus in the stream was He, in Him the stream, For now into His Soul the Waters came. 160 The Waters of that loathsome Cup, which He Both fear'd and lov'd, eschew'd and chose to drink: The fatal dregs of Wrath and Misery; Of every black and dreadful thing the Sink; The true dead Sea, compar'd with which, alas, Curs'd Sodom's Lake a living Fountain was. 161 Heav'n's Justice (who had with a constant Eye Observ'd all Tribes of Men, and noted down Each little slip, and broad Impiety, With all the trappings Time and Place had thrown About them,) hither rent her passage, and Full in thy Spouse's Face took up her stand. 162 For at His Eyes alone her own she shot, And not at theirs who most deserv'd the blow. The dint was so intolerable, that Not any Rock, nor Mount, or World knew how To meet its fury. O what Parallel Can represent this direful spectacle! 163 Less Terror from the Vulture's count'nance breaks When she her tallons claps upon her prey; Less from the Eyes of Lightning, when it takes Aim for the Thunder's arrows; than to day Flash'd from this cruel Maid, in whose fell look Her dismal Throne accomplish'd Vengeance took. 164 Immortal Dread star'd wide in either Eye; Plow'd was her Forehead, and the Furrows deep Sown with the Seeds of all Severity, And now mature for Jesus's Soul to reap: Her Cheeks red-hot, a spark was every Word, Bright fire her Lips, her Tongue a flaming Sword. 165 She never in such horrible Array March'd down to Earth; not when she furnish'd came With Water's arms to wash the World away; Or purge Gomorrha with a flood of Flame; Or wet her winged fiery Serpents' Tongue, The Israelites' Rebellion to sting. 166 A veil, so hideously black, that Night Or Hell, could not in Darkness vie with it, 'Twixt Heav'n and Her was spread; which, tho' Day-light Here now at liberty, would not permit The stoutest Mortal's Sin-condemned Eyes, To reach the gracious comfortable Skies. 167 Ten thousand Furies throng'd on either hand, With millions of Pangs and Ejulations; Whilst strong Eternity supported, and Hugg'd every Horror: troops of Desperations, Raving and rioting with barbarous chear In their own Blood, made up her Army's Rear. 168 A Massy sable Book she sternly held, And op'd it leaf by leaf to Jesus's Eyes: When lo, each dreadful page appeared fill'd With crouds of such transcendent Prodigies, As quite absolv'd from Horridness's guilt Those Feinds of which her Regiments were built. 169 Lin'd out was that Rebellion there, which grew In Paradise, so huge and rank a Weed, That it no limits but the World's would know; For through all Generations its Seed It scatter'd thick, and made each pois'ned Birth Of its own Death bring full assurance forth. 170 The Serpent which in Eden planted it, Wears not such fatal Horror in his Face, Nor stings so deep, nor can his Venom spit So far and wide, nor e'r attended was With such a numerous hissing fry, as this Old Beldame sin by young ones follow'd is. 171 This was the fearful Frontespice: But Pride Usurp'd the first and fairest Leaf, and shew'd (What never mask was large enough to hide) Her swoll'n and blister'd Countenance, which spew'd Rank baneful matter, being brused by A fall she caught as she was climbing high. 172 Then follow'd learing Spight, sly Calumny, Lean Avarice besmear'd with gnawing Rust, Ignoble Cheating, ugly Treachery, Dark sneaking Theft, and ever-stinging Lust, Intemperance wallowing in a nasty flood Of Vomit; Murder in a sea of Blood. 173 That Earth-relying Heav'n-distrusting Thing, Foolish base-hearted Infidelity; Grinding Extortion, and self-torturing, Because for ever jealous Tyranny; Rotten Hypocrisy; proud learned Folly; Dire Discontent; and hellish Melancholy. 174 Disloyal Murmurs; Pulpit Villanies; Curs'd Holy Leagues; and zealous Profanations; Sin-fatning Fasts; Thanksgiving solemn Lyes; Bold Sacrilege; rebellious Reformations; Enchanting Error; venemous Heresy; New Lights and Spirits; old Idolatry. 175 But for their number, it disdains the skill Of Computation, and all figures' reach, Not all the Sparks whose glistering Armies fill The field of Heav'n; not all the Atoms which Traffick about the Summer Air, can tell Their mighty Total how to parallel. 176 For each dwarf fault, and gyant Crime did stand In martial rank and file arrayed there, Which any humane Tongue of Heart or Hand Was ever stained with, since through the ear Of heedless Eve the Tempter's charms let in The desperate Torrent of contagious Sin. 177 Nay more than so: for every Stain which through All Ages to the end of Time's carreer Shall taint the World, most mindful Justice now Had in a black Appendix marshall'd: there Psyche, thy proud Revolt, and all the rest Of thy offences, were at large exprest. 178 And so were His, whose Pen hereafter shall Paint, with more Will than Art, thy Legend: His, His monstrous Score, which stood outglaring all Its hideous Neighbours. And so true is this My Witness, that it fairly by his Hand In his own Records registred shall stand. 179 And if the least of Crimes, (as sure it is,) Be infinitely foul, imagin then How strange a Mass of horridness was this Whose bulk was swell'd with All the Sins of Men: What store of black Infinities were here For single Jesus's wounded Back to bear. 180 For Justice heap'd them all upon His Back, That He who did no Sin, might suffer all. How would the World's deep-rooted Pillars crack, Should such a Load upon their shoulders fall! How would the all-supporting Center faint, And strive to shrink into a smaller Point! 181 How would the joints of noblest Seraphs quake; How would the Cherubs' sinnews tremble at This Burden, which all Nature's bones would break, And lay Heav'n's highest stoutest Powers flat! Which all human Hearts for ever press Down to that bottom which is bottomless! 182 Now Jesus groans, and feels His heartstrings stretch, This monstrous Weight so sadly on them lies: Those other Torments He forgets with which The Whips and Nails and Jewish Blasphemies His Patience had varied: River's powers Are lost, when them the mighty Sea devours. 183 Should all the deepest Pangs that e'r did yet The Veins and Joints and Lives of Mortals tear, In one fell composition be knit, And then enraged to their full carreer; Less furious would their fury be than that Which now on Jesus's soul in triumph sate. 184 It sate in triumph, barracading up All Avenues which to His heart did lead, That not the least Relief might pass, nor Hope It self; if possible, be suffered To march that way. Alas what Martyrs e'r Girt in so strict a siege of Sorrows were! 185 Some Comfort it would be, if Heav'n would now But with a gentile Aspect own its Son; Who spies no Consolation's glimpse below: But O, the Spheres are not eclips'd alone By Phebus's absence; no; another Night Has thrown its curtain o'r Heav'n's dearer Light. 186 The Light which from His Father's pleased eyes His whole Soul us'd to drink, its influence hid: With earnest labouring looks He pleads, and pries, But is by sad Obscurity deny'd. O Blackness, which no Parallel canst know! To thee, all Ink is Milk, all Pitch is Snow. 187 Ask me not Psyche, what He suffer'd now: Those Pangs are fitter for thy adoration, Than for thine intellect: and they who row With bold Enquiries through this Stormy Passion, Will scarce avoid their shallow thoughts to wrack Upon some dangerous desperate Mistake. 188 Long grappled He with this unbounded Grief In patient silence: but His Soul at length Snatching at least the desolate relief Of free Complaining, with the utmost strength Of His imbitter'd spirit, thus He spake: My God, My God, why dost Thou Me forsake? 189 Am I not still Thy Son, in whom alone Well-pleas'd Thou wert? Is not Thy Bosom still The same, where once My habitation I freely could enjoy? wilt Thou expel Me, Me the Image of Thy blessed Face, Thus from the view of its all-sweetning Grace? 190 Less terrible that Outcry was which shook The tow'rs of Memphis, when the wretched King And all his People, to one fatal stroke Beheld their Firstborn Hopes an Offering: And that which tore Gomorrha's throat, when from The Heav'ns she felt her Hell and Brimstone come. 191 Had every Sigh, and every Groan and Shriek With which the Air of Bethlehem was rent When Rachel saw the streets so sadly reek With an unheard-of flood of innocent And infant blood, met in one Ejulation, Its fra[n]gor had not match'd this Exclamation. 192 Never was such a lamentable Cry Wrung from the mouth of Grief; and never was Complaint more unregarded: Clemency Was deaf; without all bowels Heav'n no less Than Earth, pass'd by. Did ever tragick Day So black a Scene of Heaviness display! 193 Sorrow her self amazed at the sight, Would have repented of her Tyranny: But Jesus meant not to decline the fight Since die He could, but could not conquer'd be. O no: He hugs His Horrors, and although His Nature shrinks, His Courage loves His Woe. 194 Thus gallant Soldiers in the dreadful Wars With generous Pride their gushing blood behold; Counting their Glories only by their Scars, And that their dearest Limbs they well have sold, Yea and their Hearts, and Lives; if so they may Upon their Herses wear triumphant Bay. 195 How fondly dreamt some Standers by, who thought That He Elias call'd to help Him down! He help'd Elias up; and could have brought Him and his Charet back: but He His own Fast-fixed Pillar of extreme Reproach More glorious judgeth than that Prophet's Coach. 196 At length, as in the furnace of His Pain This helpless Victor fries, He cries, I thirst. O how He long'd Himself to drink and drain The dregs of Grief; that none of that accurst And deadly Draught He might behind Him leave, His mortal Brethren evermore to grieve. 197 But cruel They His burning lips present With Vinager, who broach'd the Wine for Them, His Blood's most precious Wine; all which He spent To wash and cheer their hearts. Do's He not seem O salvage Jews, without the help of this Strange Gift, to feel enough of Bitterness! 198 Is this your Thanks to Him, whose Bountie's Hand Cull'd out for you the Jewel of the Earth, Your fertile milk-and-honey flowing Land? And who a Kingdom of more noble worth To entertain you, after this, prepares, A Canaan situate above the Stars. 199 Yet Jesus takes it kindly, Psyche; He Knew that this gnawing Draught would best befit The dying King of Grief; and Prophesy Had long ago for Him provided it: From Heav'n's severe Decree at first 'twas wrung, And drop'd into His mouth from David's tongue. 200 Besides: that Poison He remembred well Which in th'enchanting Apple's sweetness grew: By wholsom Bitterness He means to heal Ev's licorish Luxury: His Palate now Both expiates Her's, and nobly teacheth it That Apple's fatal rellish to forget. 201 This done: the Tragedy began to know Its End approach'd: For Jesus having by Immortal Patience undergone the Law And Curse, and grappled with the monstrous fry Of all the World's Transgressions; lifts His head In triumph up, and cries, 'Tis finished. 202 O that it were! said Mary who stood by: So should my Soul still live with my dear Lord. If He has found a way how not to die In purchasing our life, His cheerful word Now now may He make good! So sighed she: But He made haste to His Catastrophe. 203 For Justice now had nothing more to say; The Blood which down the Cross its torrents threw All her Objections had wash'd away; And every Page of her black Volume grew Full as serene and fair as is the skies Pure face when rescu'd from the Clouds' disguise. 204 Dismissing therefore all her horrid Train, Her satisfied self she strait withdrew: When Jesus looking up to Heav'n again, Perceiv'd the Veil, which shadow'd had till now His Father's Face, remov'd. O blessed Sight! O cheerful Morning after heavy Night! 205 No absence of the Sun could now forbid His bright and heav'nly Day of Joy to shine; Such floods of purest Comfort issued Out from the fountain of that most divine Most tender Apparition, as drown'd The streams and pains of every bleeding wound. 206 He saw His Sire's eternal Arms as wide Stretch'd out, as His were on the Cross; He saw His gracious ready open Bosom bid Him to his Nest of Bliss return, and grow His happy Self again; He saw His Eye Flaming in pitying Love's extremity. 207 An everlasting Laurel in His hand He saw, designed to confute the Shame Wreath'd in His thorny Crown; He saw the grand Cherubick Quire ambitious to proclaim His Conquests in their Songs: And at the sight Resolv'd to Die, He cries with hearty might: 208 Father, into Thy hands I here commit My Spirit, which Thou woo'st to come to Thee: Up flew that mighty Word, and after it Towred His blessed Soul; whilst noble He Bow'd down His head, submitting sweetly to That Will He came by life and death to do. 209 Th'affected Temple heard His dying Cry, And with deep horror tore its clothes; to all The sober world the Veil proclaiming by That rupture's mouth, th'approaching funeral Of Jewish Rites, and Moses' resignation Of mouldering Law to Gospel renovation. 210 Earth heard it too, and at the fra[n]gor quaked, Her Rocks were rent, her Sepulchres flew ope; And many sleeping Saints by it awaked, Russled their Dust together and gat up: Nature's commotion was so great and strange, That in the sturdy Guard it wrought a Change. 211 The bold Centurion with the Earth did shake, (So did the Soldiers with the Rocks,) and cry, Surely the World slept in a deep Mistake, Whilst it discern'd not Jesus's Deity: His Father now has owned Him, and He Dy'd when Himself was pleas'd in Bliss to be. 212 For still His Vitals in their strength remain'd, Though plunder had so deeply rack'd his Veins; Witness that final Blast of His, which strain'd That thundring Cry: still in their lingring pains These wretched Thieves we see, whilst He is gone To rest Himself on His Celestial Throne. 213 Nay, even on salvage and obdurate Jews, So far can guilty Fear prevail, that now The Danger-stricken People could not chuse But grant their Conscience felt this Terror's Blow; For though their sullen Tongue would not, their Fist Confess'd their Fright upon their beaten Breast. 214 Here, Psyche, whose soft Heart had come and gone A thousand times, as he the story told, Yielded her self to Grief's dominion; For e'r her Guardian spy'd it, down she roll'd, Joining her Passion to her Lord's, and trying With Him who dy'd for her, to live by dying. 215 So when the Father of her Life and Joy, His fair self plunges in th'Atlantick Main, O'rpowr'd by sympathetick sweet annoy The loyal Marigold makes haste to gain Her West as well as He; her golden Eye She shuts, and till he lives again, do's die. 216 But Phylax by his Heav'nly tender Art, Her and her Spirits rais'd, and told her, She Must hear the other seasonable part, Which of this sadness made a Comedy. She look'd, and sigh'd, and cry'd, All Joys are dead When Jesus dies: and yet, dear Sir, proceed. 217 Know then, said he, this Passion and Death Hath purchas'd all Life's Joys that Heav'n can breed And cancell'd every fatal Bond of Wrath, Which Sin had drawn against old Adam's Seed: All Jesus's Wounds are open Gates, which in To Paradise lead reconciled Men. 218 All pains and sorrows and reproaches, He, Brave He, adventur'd to monopolize; The spightful Cunning of Hell's Treachery He vanquished by being made its Prize; And yielding up His meritorious Breath, Blew down the Powers ev'n of prevailing Death. 219 Which when fell Satan saw, it him repented Of what he toil'd and sweat to bring about; And at his Den in Paxis he lamented His undermin'd Design, when crying out, Great Pan is dead, he made confession how He had projected his own Overthrow. 220 For this was Pan indeed, the God of Sheep; Who held His tender Flock so dear, that He From Wolves and Lyons it secure to keep, Would to their rage Himself a booty be: But made His Fold a rampart sure and stout, When with His Blood He moated it about. 221 Yet Hell at length will prick on Mortal Wit Against this Passion's Merit to dispute, And all their syllogizing Batteries set, In order their Redemption to confute. Thus to their Reason must their Faith give way; Though God be satisfy'd, yet will not they. 222 No; they'll account His Mercy injur'd by Allowing Justice to be fully pay'd. Ah learned fool! is Mercy's Majesty Not here triumphant, when the Load is lay'd On God's own Son, to bear what else would crack Proud though you be, for evermore your back? 223 But now a Soldier, he whose only Heart Was harder than those Rocks which Grief had burst, To act accomplish'd Cruelty's last part, His Spear into his Savior boldly thrust: Deep in His Side the Iron div'd, and brought The final Stream of Blood and Water out: 224 That Water which the Pericardium bound About the Heart, that Blood which in it dwelt: For Jesus all His store with most profound And bounteous Love, to feast His Children spilt. The Pelican so with her dearest Blood Diets and fattens up her dearer Brood. 225 This done: the Sun unveil'd his clouded Eye, And joy'd the new-redeemed World to see: The monstrous shades forthwith made haste to fly Down to the bottom of Night's hideous sea; That now Sin's blackness chased was away, Earth might behold a double glorious Day. 226 A Day, in which her Count'nance shin'd with more Unspotted Grace, than when Heav'n tried by A deluge of its Powers, to wash and scoure The senior World's ingrained villany: For 'tis not Heav'n it self can yield a Flood So purgative as that of Jesus's Blood. 227 But will no Pity on the Body look, Which now has tir'd the utmost spight of spight? Yes; Arimathean Joseph undertook Fairly to pay it its Sepulchral Right: And by that courteous Loyalty, to prove That he had a Disciple been of Love. 228 A true Disciple, though a secret one: Witness his Fear, to generous Courage grown: For though his Master now was dead and gone, His Faith revives; nor shall the Highpriest's frown, Or People's fury fright this Duty from Yielding his Lord his own right costly Tomb. 229 Of Honor he a Person was, and fit To wait on this Solemnity: his fair Petition Pilate could not but admit In common Courtship: to his pious care He grants the Corps; and sighs to think that he Had made it need that funeral charity. 230 With prouder joy his garland never did Olympick Victor snatch, than Joseph now This richer Prize: which he inveloped In dainty Linen, white as driven-snow, Fine as Arachne's web, and yet the Sheet More delicacy learn'd by kissing it. 231 Right well he knew this Solemn Paschal-Feast Forbad him all Pollution by the Dead: And yet his loving Zeal durst not desist Till he this votive Task had finished; For by the Touch, though of Dead Purity, Assur'd he was he could not stained be. 232 He being busied thus: another Friend Appear'd, good Nicodemus, who by night, On living Jesus did long time attend, To gain for his obscured Judgment, Light; He in his blacker Ev'n of Death will now His grateful Piety on Him bestow. 233 Of precious Aromatick mixtures he An hundred-weight brings in, to sacrifice Unto this Body's service; so to be Enobled, and enhanced in their price: For as they touch the blessed Skin, they smil'd, And felt themselves with richer sweetness fill'd. 234 Mean while the Instruments of Death (for this The manner was,) were yonder buried: Where sleep they must until a Queen shall rise Out of thine Albion, from whose happy Bed A Prince shall spring, who will exalt above Rome's proudest Eagles meek Ecclesia's Dove. 235 Their dear Discovery is reserv'd for none But Venerable Helen; who, when here, Hot in her passionate Devotion, Her Savior's sufferings she her self shall bear, Transfiguring her Meditating Heart Into the prey of every wound and smart. 236 These sacred Relicts shall revealed be In guerdon of her gallant Love and Zeal: There for the Jewels she shall dig, and see At length, the rude but glorious Spectacle; The Cross, and every Nail she there shall find Which her Lord's Body pierc'd, and her own Mind. 237 Inestimable shall their Worth be held: One Nail to her Imperial Son shall seem Illustrious enough his Head to gild, And sit enthroned on his Diadem: Two in his Bridle shall triumph, when He Rides through the World like King of Victory. 238 The Fourth shall tame the Adriatick Main, And nail it fast to its still bottom, so That on its polish'd pacified Plain The gliding Barks may unmolested go: Then by this Gem shall that enriched Sea More Wealthy than the Eastern Ocean be. 239 But for the noble Cross; no Tongue shall tell The wonders that shall spring from that dry Tree; Which hew'd out by Devotion's edge, shall fill The zealous world, and quit that Injury, Which from the deadly Bough in Eden spread Through all the fields e'r sown with Human seed. 240 Persia shall take it captive, yet not dare To look upon its Pris'ner; Piety Shall thence redeem it by a generous war, And reinstate it in its Calvary; When great Heraclius his own Royal Back A willing Chariot for it shall make. 241 Nor shall his glorious Sign have less esteem Attendant on it, but be always worn On holy Foreheads as the only Gem, Which knows both how to strengthen and adorn: A Gem, whose lustre frights all Devils' Eyes, And whose brave value Swine alone despise. 242 But, Psyche, here upon the western side Of this now holy Mountain, thou mayst see The precious Sepulchre of Him who dy'd And who aforehand bury'd was for thee. This Rock is it: Come let's into the Cave; No Temple is more holy than this Grave. 243 Joseph bestow'd the reverend Treasure here: Here lay the blessed Head, and here the Feet: Hard was the Couch indeed, yet never were Those of the daintiest Kings so purely sweet; Not Solomon's, although Arabia did With all her odorous Wealth, go there to bed. 244 The Phenix's balmy Grave could ne'r afford Such sovereign powers of Perfumes, as here Breath'd from the Body of thy breathless Lord; Who soon the truer Phenix did appear. O peerless Tomb! which buries all the Fame Of Mausolean Sepulchres in shame. 245 The Monuments of Princes are but fair Memorials of their putid Rottenness, Whilst odious Worms and Dirt inshrined are In specious Gold and Marble: But in this Plain artless Vault both Putrifaction found Her Hands were more than that dead Body's bound. 246 This is that Solemn Oratory, where The choicest Souls ambitious are to pray; Their Pilgrimages all determin here; And prostrate here their zealous Vows they pay: With their devoutest Tears they dew this Floor, And in this Air their warmest sighs they pour. 247 Yet time's at hand, when strong Idolatry This sacred Cave will venture to prophane, To turn this Paradise into a Sty, To plant in this sweet Bed the worst of Bane; To rear Hell's sovereign Monster, odious Jove, Upon this Monument of divinest Love. 248 But all in vain; for Christian Eagles still Will to the dear life-giving Carcass fly; And their inflam'd desire's impatience fill, By Feasting on its precious Memory. Jove, though the most impure of things, is not So foul, as Purity's own shrine to blot. 249 That Idol's Pomp kick'd down into disgrace, To free and undisturbed Piety, Shall soon surrender its usurped place, When Pagan Powers by mightier Faith shall be Good Manners taught; and Crowns, and Scepters low Before the Crucified King shall bow. 250 And here may'st thou (for I thy heats discover) Sweet Psyche, stay, and ease thy burning Breast: Thy Vows and Prayers, whose working-tide runs over, Here may thou empty: do, thou welcome Guest, Do, riot in thy zeal, and revel high In meek Devotion's noble Luxury. 251 Psyche, who scarcely for this Cue could wait, Fell on her face, and kiss'd the reverend Floor; Where melted by her earnest fervour, strait Her sighs and soul she labour'd forth to pour; And by the strong embrace of Faith and Love, Hug'd Him below, who was enthron'd above. 252 Through all His Pains and all His Wounds she went, And in her Bosom printed every one; Her Bowels with His woful Cry she rent; Each Scoff she echoed by as sad a groan; By bitter thoughts, His Nails, His Thorns, His Spear, Anew she fram'd, by tears His Vinegar. 253 But coming to His Death, she fetch'd a sigh Up from the bottom of her Soul, in hope Her Life would out with it together fly, And make her Passion too completely up; Striving in meek ambitious Love to have The ready Honor of her Savior's Grave. 254 Desire lay boiling in her ardent Breast; A violent march her Aspirations beat, Reaching with restless panting at that Rest, To which her Lord was flown: and in the heat Of this contention she was towr'd so high, That scarce her Body upon Earth did lie. 255 (O blessed Boistrousness of loving Zeal, How strange a thing seem'st thou to worldly Hearts, Whose cold and dead Affections never feel The flaming Wounds of these delicious Darts! How gravely would they pity Psyche's state, As womanish and fondly passionate? 256 And how, alas, stand I amazed at These rare calcining Raptures, who am by Dull Indevotion's frost benummed! yet Their contemplation thaws me so, that I Can drop a Verse, and must, to wait on Them; So due Applause's Tribute I esteem.) 257 But when Life held her on this dainty Rack, She in an Ocean of Inamorations And new ecstatick Gulfs resolv'd to wrack Her labouring Heart: and yet these machinations, And dangerous Storms of Love's intestine war, She by diviner Love's assistance bare. CANTO XV. The Triumph of Love. The ARGUMENT. In his own Den Love binds the King of Hate, Death and Corruption in the Grave subdues: Turns back the bridled Stream of mortal Fate, Himself alive to His Disciples shews: In Triumph's bright Excess Ascends upon A Cloud, and mounts His everlasting Throne. 1 Vicissitude, how doth thy welcome Change Cheer up the world, which else would droop and faint! Strange things thou long permit'st not to be strange, Since with all Companies thou canst acquaint; For thy Chamelion's skin no Colours meets But with compliance fairly them it greets. 2 When Wisdom fram'd this World's vast fabrick, she As Nature's noble Sport and Recreation Firmly enacted thy Uncertainty For ever certain in its Variation: That as God knows no Change, so all Things else May feel the motion of Mutation's pulse. 3 Night first was every Thing; then Day burst forth, But soon the Ev'n restored night again; Yet crept she in the Morn behind the Earth, And suffer'd Light her full twelve hours to reign: Thus have all Ages only been the Play Of interwoven checker'd Night and Day. 4 Who seeth not how beauteous Generation Fails not to tread on foul Corruption's heels; And how Corruption by sure Circulation Upon the back of Generation steals: Whilst by this Trade of Interchange, from Wombs Death takes its constant Rise, and Life from Tombs! 5 When peevish Winter's Blasts churlishly blow His frozen Scythia all about the Earth, Commanding Nature in a bed of Snow To lie and sleep, and let no Bud peep forth; What hopes would fancy She could break again Out from the bondage of her icey Chain? 6 Yet when the Sun leaps in the lusty Ram, Forthwith the Spring takes heart, embraved by The neighbour-hood of his enlivening flame, And clothes the World with fresh Fertility; Cashiering Frost and Snow, and changing Queen Tellus's white Mantle to a lovelyer green. 7 Sometimes the Winds conspire upon the Main To plow the Deeps and throw them at the Sky To let them thunder headlong down again, And with new Wrath return them up as high; Till all the Sea be on a foaming sweat, And Rocks, and Ships, and Hearts of Sailers, split. 8 Yet when these Breaths their fury out have blown, The Ocean slides into a polish'd Plain, Mildly excusing every billowy frown With smiling Looks: the Sirens play again; The Seamen hoise their sails; the Halcyon lays Her eggs, and gives her name to quiet Days. 9 When Empires stoop to more imperious Fate, And Time's bold Sithe mows stoutest Scepters down; Themselves those glorious Ruins congregate Into the Circle of some other Crown; And from the Dust that Seed of Honor springs Into a golden Harvest of new Kings. 10 After the earnest Ploughman hath by Day Worry'd himself, and earth, and water'd it With his own sweat; cool night his head doth lay Still on his crib, and teach him to forget His toilsome work; whilst soft and gentle sleep Yields him a crop of pleasant Dreams to reap. 11 Though pitch'd in Power's saddle far they ride, And kick and trample all things in their way; The insolent Vulgar find at length their Pride Check'd by a sudden Fall; no Tigres may For ever rage; nor can the Tyranny Of blackest Parliaments immortal be. 12 When tedious Sickness by her rampant Fits Has in the body her sad Revels kept; Health takes her happy cue, and fairly quits Her cheerly self; by Her the Veins are swept, The Stomach purg'd, the Spirits, which 'gan to tire, Rouz'd and incouraged by vivid Fire. 13 Though Grief sometimes, conspiring with the Night, On wounded Hearts Disconsolation throws; Yet Comfort, dawning with the morning Light, Smootheth the sullen furrows of the brows, And with its Virgin beams of sweetness dries The briny moisture of the clouded eyes. 14 But that Vicissitude still wins the Bay Of Pleasantness, which cures the worst of Gall; Whose Rayes can chase the shades of Death away, And kindle Solace in a Funeral; Which to a Sepulchre dares say: Stand ope, And let thy Pris'ner into Life get up. 15 Indeed some glimpses of this blessed Change Had glanced on the World before; yet they Were faint Preludiums of that full and strange Mutation which shin'd on Easterday: For they atchieved were by borrow'd Might, This dawn'd and rose by none but its own Light. 16 In truly sovereign Jesus's only Hand Dwelt that authentick power, which knew both how To give His mortal Fate a Countermand, And make His stubborn Grave repent; to throw Aside His useless Shroud, and cleerly turn His own Death's Night into a living Morn. 17 And since the present Scene now prompts him to The glorious Story, Phylax means to paint Its quickning wonders unto Psyche, who Under her holy Passion strove to faint: He takes her up, and sweetly cries, My Dear, Life's Monument, as well as Death's, is hear. 18 And 'tis the same; this Grave proclaimeth now With open mouth the famous Death of Death: Come sit thee down, and I will tell thee how Thy noble Lord by being vanquish'd, hath Victorious prov'd, and reap'd such Palms of Glory As ne'r till now adorned Conqueror's Story. 19 When in this Casket pious Joseph had The precious Jewel laid; a massy Stone Upon the Monument he pitch'd, and made It safe from Injurie's invasion; Still jealous of the Highpriest's tyranny, Which with the Death of Jesus could not die. 20 It could not die; and was resolv'd that He Should neither live, nor seem to live again, Whom their flagitious Importunity Had by faint-hearted Pilat's Sentence slain: To him they crouch afresh, and fawning cry, Long live great Cesar, and his Deputy. 21 Sir, in our God's, and in our Country's name, Due thanks we tender for that Justice you Have done on Jesus, blotting out the shame His foul mouth on our Temple spew'd: and know That Cesar too owes you applause, since He Reigns by your Care from dangerous Tumults free. 22 What might this desperate Conjurer not have, If He had vengeance scap'd and lived still; Who by the Magick of His Death alone Jerusalem doth with Amazement fill? How many Fondlings stroke their breasts, and cry'd, Sure He's the Son of God, ev'n when He dy'd! 23 Thus when some saucy Exhalation bears Its earthborn self high in the yielding air, And counterfeits possession of the Spheres; The Silly Multitude in wonder glare Upon th'illustrious Hypocrite, and call That Fire a Star, although they see it fall. 24 There's danger therefore, least this Serpent's Blood Rankle the Air, and taint our credulous Nation; Indeed Himself right cunningly thought good To pave the way to some such Perturbation; Telling His Scholars that He must be slain, But with the third Day up would rise again. 25 Now Sir, if sheltered by thievish Night, Him from His grave they pilfer, and proclaim That He is Risen by His heav'nly Might; What Hazard might attend so strange a Fame! How would the seeming Miracle entice Seditious Multitudes with Him to Rise! 26 Then would the Mischief swell to bolder height Than if the Traytor were indeed alive: Against the Torrent of that new Deceit Your Power in vain, in vain our Care should strive: For how shall We attach Him who is dead, Yet into new Life's reputation fled? 27 Say what we could, the mutinous Rabble still By this His Grave's wide-open mouth would seal Up ours, provoking to that Miracle By which they'l count'nance their rebellious Zeal; And with outragious Cheating bear us down That Him they honor who to heav'n is flown. 28 Pilate, whose Conscience Grip'd him hard for what His Fears before had done, no more would trade In that uncomfortable Bus'ness; but Them of their spightful Project Masters made. Ye have a Watch; secure the Tomb, said he, And satisfy your politick Jealousy. 29 Impowred thus, away fly They, to fix And make God sure for ever stirring more: Both Caiaphas and Annas sign their Wax Upon the Stone which dammed up the Door; Charging a double Guard, appointed well With Swords and Spears, to wait on either Seal. 30 Ah politick Fools! your strong Conspiracy Shall only undermine it self, and make The Resurrection's glorious Mystery With more unanswerable Lustre break Forth in your Face; since both your Seals and Guard Shall witness to the Miracle afford. 31 So when the Envy-blinded Median Peers Had lodg'd great Daniel in the Sealed Den Of hungry Death; their Jealousies and fears They confidently laid asleep: but when The Day awak'd, they saw their fell Design Prov'd his Deliverance but the more divine. 32 Mean while the sacred Corps lay dormant here, And jolly Death triumphed in the Grave; For once she bids her ghastly count'nance wear The guise of lusty Gladness, and gives leave To her dire Tongue to change its baleful Tone, And cheer into a Shout her wonted Groan. 33 Long had she vex'd and pin'd, remembring how Brave Enoch and Elias rescu'd were From her contagious Monarchy: but now That feebler Pair she is content to spare, And gluts her bloody heart with barbarous glee In this grand Trophy of her Victory. 34 She never took such proud Delight to set Her foot upon the vast Zamzummim's Tomb, Or see all Anak's Sons in Ashes meet, Or heav'n-commanding Joshua earth become, Or steely Sampson turn to rotten Clay, Or huge Goliah mouldering away. 35 She kiss'd her reeking Dart, and vow'd to build An Ark of triumph to its conquest; high In fierce disdain she all the World beheld, Which now had no pretence but it must Die; Since Life's own Champion became her Prey, And tame and cold and dead before her lay. 36 There lay His Body: but His Soul mean time Triumphed more than She; for down into The kingdom of the hidden World, the Clime Of unsuspecting Night, it march'd, and so Surpris'd the Powers of Hell all napping in The secret cloisters of their gloomy Den. 37 The Gates of sturdy brass it flung in sunder, Shaking the bottom of the monstrous Deep; The Porter frighted at the Ruin's thunder Into the Gulf for shelter took his leap; But equal Horror there he found, for all The Pit was startled when the Gates did fall. 38 So when the mighty Son of Manoah, who Presumed was the City's Pris'ner, tore The Gates of Gaza, rending freedom to His conquering March; the Neighbours' dreadful Roar The Pillars' boistrous Crack rebounded, who Thought both their Roofs and Sculs were spliting too. 39 This stubborn Fort by Storm thus taken; on The noble Victor hasted to advance: No Guard secur'd His passage, who alone Army and General was, and whose sole Glance Had power enough to make his Pris'ners know Whose Justice kindled their Death's fire below. 40 But now imperial Lustre from His face Streaming upon the eyes of hideous Night, Pour'd on the swarthy flames of that foul place So vast an Ocean of Immortal fright That into every hole they crept aside Seeking their everlasting shame to hide. 41 About the hollow bowels of the Cave An universal Groan its sadness spread; Whose Echo such a ruful answer gave That Hell seem'd gasping on its dying bed: Strait followed such Yellings, Shrieks, and Cries, As truly spake Damnation's Miseries. 42 Imagin what the blear-ey'd Sons of Night, Ravens, Scritchowls, Bats, and such foul things would do, When in their black blind Nests by Highnoon Light Suddenly seiz'd; O whether shall they go Now their illustrious foe's bright arrows reach The very entrails of their closest Pitch! 43 Incomparably direr was the Dread Which shot it self quite through the heart of Hell. For these commanding Raies maintain'd their speed Through every dark and massy Obstacle With such stout Brightness, that amidst the store Of never-dying fires it quickned more. 44 The Lakes of Sulphure boiled with new heat; Each Grief and Pang and Torment hotter grew; Despair afresh at every bosom beat; Upon the next feind's face each fury flew; And every Devil scratch'd and tore his brother, Wreaking their madness upon one another. 45 The Snakes their hisses and their poison spit, And in a thousand knots ty'd and unty'd Their woful selves: the frighted Gorgons split Their raving Throats' hot furnace; and the wide And fiery-mouthed Dragons howling loud Whole torrents of their flaming venome spew'd. 46 The Peers of Hell curs'd their unhappy King Whose Pride betray'd them to this Anguish; they Had hopes the Light of Heav'n would never spring In their black Clime, to pour on them Dismay: But now they saw't in Jesus' eyes, it more Vex'd them than when they fell from it before. 47 Their belking bosoms heaved high, and fain They would have belched out ther working load Of Blasphemy, which held their souls in pain; But mighty Terror stopp'd the sulphury road Of their rank breath, and forc'd their ready Sin Only to split their hearts and rage within. 48 Black Avarice with desperate Treachery And foul-mouth'd slander, who their parts had play'd With fair Success in that Conspiracy By which Life's Sovereign was to death betray'd; With guilty horror quaked now, and found Upon themselves their Mischiefs all rebound. 49 Though mad Confusion always reigned here, She never sate so high upon her throne, Nor such monarchick sway as now did bear In all the Deep; whose strange Distraction Outvy'd the Discords of that wallowing Mass In whose rude Womb the World conceived was. 50 But yet the Dragon red in guiltless blood, Great Belzebub, was more confounded than All Hell besides: for well he understood He now was deeplyer subdu'd, than when Down from the pinacle of Heav'n he fell Into the center of profoundest Hell. 51 That Jesus, for whose life he long ago Fiercely a-hunting upon Bethlehem went With Herod's pack of Hounds; that Jesus, who When in the Desert all his Craft he bent To cheat Him into Sin, his deep Design Quite overturn'd by Wisdom's countermine: 52 Him whom he by the odious Wit of Scorn Through Jews' blasphemous mouths had vilify'd; Whom by hir'd Treason he had Pris'ner born Unto his mortal Enemie's Bar, and try'd By all th'impetuous lawless Laws of Cries, Threatnings, broad Tumults, broader Calumnies: 53 Whom by the Petulance of his Miscreants he Had spit upon, had scourg'd, had buffeted; Whom through all Infamie's extremity He to this mountain of His Death had led; Whom on the Tree of Shame and Pain he nail'd, And then with further blasphemies assail'd. 54 Whom of His blood he plunder'd, and at last Of breath and life: whom having murder'd thus, In marble lodg'd and watch'd he sealed fast, And clearly then was thought victorious; This very Jesus's Soul he seeth now Marching with triumph in his Realm below. 55 He sees his deep-laid Projects turn'd into Just Engines of their Master's overthrow: He sees he was his own most deadly fo When he to Jesus gave the mortal Blow; That Death by which he hop'd to have supprest The life of Life, now lives in his own breast. 56 He sees that his mistaken self alone Condemned was in Jesus's Sentence; that The Multitude's mad Exclamation But prefac'd to his Groans; that Mary's Brat (For so his scornful Pride had term'd Him,) now Was Son to Him to whom all Angels bow. 57 He sees the Cross in goodly Banner spread, And shining with imperial gallantry; He sees that precious Blood which made it red, Adorn it now with dreadful Majesty. He sees it streaming in the swarthy air, And at its awful motion melts for fear. 58 He sees the angry Thorns, and feels them pricking His guilty Soul: he sees each cruel Nail, And in his harder heart resents them sticking: He shrinks; he winds about his woful Tail; He starts, and finds that something more than Hell Did now in his tormented bosom dwell. 59 Three times he clap'd his Pride upon the back, And cheer'd his everlasting Stomach up; But strait his swelling heart-strings 'gan to crack, And fail'd the courage of his insolent Hope: Three times his fury strove to check his fear, Yet Terror still his Boldness overbare. 60 But Jesus marched on in conquering Might, And pitch'd His foot full on the Monster's head: All Thunder's throats did never yet affright The Air with such a Roar as bellowed From Satan's jaws, when by that crushing Load He justly learn'd the weight of angry God. 61 For as the surly Lyon, wounded by Some Hero in his own invaded Den, Rends all the Cavern with impatient Cry, And makes his frighted Neighbours further run: So Belzebub's huge Shriek tore all his Deep, And forc'd the Elves into their holes to creep. 62 Had all the World been heav'd upon his head, And thousands more upon the back of this, The Burden had not been so vastly sad; For all the weight of Weight meer Lightness is To that strange Pressure which the Rebel now Felt sealed sure upon his squeazed Brow. 63 His squeazed Brow: for both his Horns were broke; So was his Scull; from whence a Torrent burst Of ranker Bane than e'r had power to choke The soul of Sweets; a Torrent of accurst Designs, of Rage, of Pride, of every thing Which qualifies Hell's true accomplish'd King. 64 Thus did the first and noblest Promise prove Compleatly good: thus did the Woman's Seed, The Seed of blessed Mary, spring above, And trample down the wiley Serpent's head, Quite shattering it; so to revenge that spight With which he us'd the heel of Man to bite, 65 This done; Learn now, the mighty Victor cry'd, That as above, so I can reign below. What you have gained by your Hate and Pride Your fellow-Elves may read upon your Brow: Deep have I grav'd the Lesson; yet I know Not deep enough to mend or Them or you. 66 For deeper printed is your desperate Spight On your obdurate hearts: and though by Me, Their Head, you might be warned not to fight Against my Members; yet had you the free Reins of your Rage, you all your Nerves would join To broach and quaff their blood, as you did Mine. 67 But Mine less precious is than theirs to Me, And They less able to defend their own. I Vindication owe; and Sympathy Demands with speed to have it payed down. Down will I pay't, and that upon thy neck, To prove My self as strong as they are weak. 68 Which said: the King of Conquest threw about The Dragon's neck an adamantine Chain: A Chain, which though the Monster's teeth be stout As hardest steel, he bites and gnaws in vain: Fast Pris'ner now he lies, and only where Jesus thinks fit to give him leave, can stir. 69 Black Judas, whom the next Oven's wrath did fry, With unconceived anguish gnash'd his teeth, Being deeper tortur'd by his Master's eye Whom he so wretchedly had sold to death. He sold his Master, but the Bargain on Himself recoiled, and he dy'd alone. 70 He look'd the next Step on his woful Head With equal Pressure surely fix'd should be; His Head, which next to crushed Satan's did Deserve preeminence in Misery. But Jesus turn'd, and would not melt him by The burning glass of His indignant Eye. 71 Him He reserved to his other Day Of Triumph, when both Caiaphas, and he, And all that cruel Rout, which made their Prey Of patient innocent Humility, Shall look on Him whom they have pierc'd, with Thorns And Whips, and Spears, and Blasphemies, and Scorns. 72 Yet He an universal Prospect took With princely Awfulness about the Gulf; The radiant Dint of which majestick Look Scorch'd every peeping Fire and sneaking Elf With hotter torment then when He at first Their brazen Gates at His arrival burst. 73 What glimpse of Hopes can cheer the Whelps when they Have seen the Father Lyon trampled down? Alas the head of every Devil lay Brused in Satan's; and they count their own No longer so, since he could not maintain With all his strength and cunning his own Brain. 74 O how they wish with helpless desperation That Hell were darker, or that Jesus's Eye Less bright and piercing! Any new Damnation Though further stretch'd than one Eternity, They would embrace, so they release might gain From this Hour's more than everlasting Pain. 75 But whilst themselves they with this Horror slew; Jesus another Fo remembring, hither March'd back again in equal state, a new Laurel of Conquest in His Tomb to gather; Where shivering and couching close lay Death Astonish'd at the dismal Noise beneath. 76 She heard the Ruin of the brazen Door; She heard the yelling of each frighted Feind; She heard oppressed Satan's sovereign Roar; And felt a sudden fatal Terror rend Her late triumphant heart, now tortur'd by Its sympathy with Hell's Calamity. 77 Arrived here, this Tyrant He descry'd With more than deadly Paleness in her face, Striving her guilty Head in vain to hide From that dread Brightness which surpriz'd the place: None of her wonted and beloved Shade To muffle up her gastly self she had. 78 Such floods of living Light from Jesus's eyes Broke forth, as with more splendor stuff'd the Grave Than swells fair Phebus's globe: Death scalded flies About, and hunts through all the dazell'd Cave To scape, if possible, that Lustre's ire Whose bus'ness seem'd to light her funeral fire. 79 When lo thy Spouse His foot already red With Hell's best blood, upon her bosom set, And cry'd, foul Monster, whom I never did Create, but stubborn Insolence beget. As I, and Mine have felt thy fury, so 'Tis time that now thou feel My Power too. 80 Due Vengeance hath thy cursed Mother Sin Drunk from this righteous Hand; and thou her Brat And rightful Heir, in vain dost nestle in This gloomy Rock to scape thy Beldame's fate. The whole World's Graves which by thy Tyranny Alone are fill'd, proclaim one due to thee. 81 Ev'n from thy birth Destruction was thy Trade, And long thou traffickedst the Earth about; Upon all Generations didst thou feed, And yet thy Stomach still new booties sought. Hell, which I plum'd but now, less bottomless Than that strange Gulf of thy lank belly is. 82 The noblest Kings no favour found with thee, But at thy stinking feet thou mad'st them bow; Thy shameless Worms thou gav'st authority On Princes' royal breasts to crawle and gnaw; Saucy Corruption thou command'st to tread And trample upon every laureat Head. 83 My dearest Saints thou mingledst with thy Prey, And stamp'dst them down into th'unworthy Dust. Whether the Lives were vile or precious, they Were equally devoured by thy Lust. Thou mockedst Youth and Strength; both Physick and Physitian stoop'd to thy destroying hand. 84 By this thine uncontrolled Cruelty To Insolence's top thy Boldness rise, And ventured to throw thy Dart at Me, That Dart which in My slaughter'd Body lies. And if I die, shalt thou exempted be! Forbid it all My Might and Majesty. 85 At that stern Word, the Monster fetch'd a Groan So great, that all the dying Cries which she Throughout the World had scrued forth in one Huge Ejulation crowded seem'd to be; All deadly Agonies that ever were, With just requital bounding now on her. 86 Strait Jesus tore in sunder every Chain In which she us'd her conquer'd Preys to ty; When lo, the fates were venturing to complain That their grand Law groan'd under injury; That Law which Heav'n it self enacted, and Bid it in Paradise's Records stand. 87 Their breeding murmur quickly reach'd His ear, Whom nothing scaped which He pleas'd to know: Up looked He, and flash'd such potent fear Upon their souls, as bow'd their heads as low As loyal Meekness: in His Looks they saw His royal Will, and knew their greater Law. 88 For what's most massy strong substantial fate More than the shadow of His mighty Pleasure? Vastest Impossibility do's at His Beck melt into Easiness: no Measure But His own Mind can of His Power be found; Infinitude Infinitude must bound. 89 He then, as Death lay groaning, pluck'd the Dart Out from His Body's side, and to the head With potent vengeance plung'd it in her heart: Whose Wound, though deep, made not the Weapon red, For all the gore that at its mouth it spew'd As black as Styx his inky puddle shew'd. 90 Thrice did the Monster gasp; and then belch'd forth Her damned Ghost, which stole its way to hell. Her Carcase stretch'd at length lay on the earth, Her Chap fell down, her Teeth all star'd, her fell And pois'nous Tongue hung dangling out: Thus She Who reign'd o'r mortals felt mortality. 91 But this almighty Victor having slain Her once by killing her, resolved now To slay her by Restoring her again To her accursed life; for from below He beckned her pale Ghost, and bid it dwell At home again, as in a fouler Hell. 92 Since I have taught thee now, said He, My Might, Remember My Command, and live again; Henceforth thou with thy Sting no more shalt fight, Nor on thy Pris'ners clap a slavish chain: Yet use thy Dart; for 'tis My royal Will Though I forbid thy rage, to let thee Kill. 93 You who were their imperious Tyrant, now Shall Servant to my mortal Brethren be, And ope the Gate by which from life below Their Souls shall fly to live and reign with Me: But, till I them require, be sure you keep Their Bodies safe in undisturbed sleep. 94 This double Conquest gain'd: He look'd aside And sneaking in a corner of the Tomb, Corruption with her Worms about her spy'd; Who long had crawl'd and sprawl'd and scrambled some Approach unto the sacred Corps to find, And wonder'd what their wonted power did bind. 95 He spy'd them there, and charg'd them to be gone: At which great Word, they into Nothing fled. Forthwith He slipp'd His ready Body on As easily as He some cloke had spread Upon His shoulders, or into a fit And graceful Ring His nimble finger put. 96 (Thus when an old and tryed fencer from His bloody Scene of Prowess, with the Prize His Virtue purchased, returneth home, There to enjoy his glorious Victories; He first revests his arms and breast, which by Their naked valour did his foes defy.) 97 His Heart with Life and Joy strait 'gan to leap, His Veins with new recover'd Heat grew hot, His blessed Eyes threw off their triduan Sleep, His thawed Joints their tedious frost forgot, Afresh the Roses budded in His lip, New smiles and Graces in His Cheeks did trip. 98 Off fell the Napkin and the Winding Sheet, Not daring to conceal the Beauties which Here in a confluence of Glory met All Parts of His pure Body to inrich; Which now no less it self outshined then It had before the fairest Sons of Men. 99 For passing through the Seirce of Death, it there Lost all the grosness of Mortality, Becoming more illustrious and clear Than silver Venus in the evening Sky: What was but course and animal till now, Purely refined and spiritual grew. 100 Nor must it longer like a Prison sit Obscure and lumpish on the Soul, but light, And quick and plyant and completely fit For all her nimblest Bus'ness: as our bright And ready Wings move with our Wills, so she Finds that comply with her Activity. 101 For He who our brave sprightfulness could make Of dull and sleepy nothing; easily may Teach heavy flesh and Blood how to awake Into Angelick Pureness, and array It round with Splendors full as gorgeous as Those which the Cherubs or the Seraphs grace. 102 But Jesus, now the promis'd Time was come As early as the third Day meant to Rise: For to His flesh remarry'd, from His Tomb He leaps; not in the boistrous Lightning's guise, Which tears the Clouds, but like that milder flash We see quite through unbroken bodies rush. 103 Hast thou not mark'd the sprightful Image fly Completely through a crystall Wall, which yet Uncrack'd it leaves! So through that Marble thy Much purer Lord Himself suddenly shot: For still it kept the Tomb's mouth close, and still Was trusty to the Priests' unmoved Seal. 104 Indeed the Mountains and the Rocks He rent When out He blew His final Gasp; to show That with His Blood His Power was not spent, But flourish'd ev'n in's dying Hand: but now His gallant Rising breaks no Stones but those Whose stubborn mine in Human bosoms grows. 105 And what more fair Decorum, than that He Who when at first into this World He came Unbroken left the pure Virginity Of His dear Mother; should renew the same Illustrious Wonder now, and issue from The untorn bowels of His virgin Tomb? 106 Thus Psyche, e'r the dull World was awake Life rose for it, and Death's strong gates set ope; The Passage clear aforehand so to make For all His Brethren's Ashes to get up. His Members risen are in Him their Head Though yet in Death they never went to bed. 107 His Resurrection the Earnest is Of theirs who ever dyed, or can die: He only buried was the Grave to dress, To purge, to sweeeten, and to sanctify: That in that safe retiring Room His friends May take their Rest, till back for them He sends. 108 Indeed all Joys seem'd slaughtered when He Wrung out the dregs of deepest Bitterness, And drunk His Death upon the fatal Tree: But this dear Morning they reviv'd, like His Arising Body grown spiritual, and Subject no more to cruel Death's command. 109 No wonder this sweet Day's enthron'd so high In pious Souls' esteem, and bears away The reverend Glory and solemnity Of old entailed on the Sabbath Day: No wonder that upon this first Day's head The Sev'nth's fair Diadem's established. 110 'Tis true; on that, God did His hand withdraw, Which He through Six Days' Work had reached; and To Jacob's seed at length into a Law His own Example turn'd; that They might stand Bound unto freedom's Feast, and since no way They had His Work to copy, act His Play. 111 But greater Rest on this Day's shore He met: For all His Life full hard He labour'd had; He wept, He strugled, and His blood He sweat, His strength, His life He spent; on Death He trode, And trampled Hell; and now rose up again In matchless triumph evermore to reign. 112 O nobler Sabbath! may all Glories swell Each hour and minute of thy sacred light: May Piety's best Exultations dwell In thee alone: and cursed be the spight Of any Heresy which e'r shall thy Most hallowed Prerogative defy. 113 The other Sabbath was a shade of Thee; And Thou the Copy art of that which shall Amidst the triumphs of Immensity Be all Heav'n's everlasting festival; That Sabbath which no higher Name shall know Than this, the Lord's Day; and that Day art Thou. 114 But is this mighty Savior quite forgot By all His followers? will faithful Zeal Endure to be interr'd with Him, and shut Up in Oblivion? shall Death and Hell Be roused thus, and Earth her dulness steep In most ungrateful unregarding Sleep? 115 No: fervid Magd'lene could not rest in bed, Because her Soul was sealed in the Tomb. And though the Sabbath's statutes her forbad Until it self expired were, to come And seek it here; yet now she cannot stay To be conducted by the Morning Ray. 116 She, and another love-inflamed friend, On Speed's wings mounted, having purchas'd store Of precious Ointment and of Spice, to spend Upon the sacred Corps, set forth before The Sun had op'd his east: yet as they came Near to the Grave, he peeped forth on them. 117 He peeped forth; and little thought that Day Was up before, and had prevented Him: 'Twas Jesus's Day; and well might scorn to stay And be beholden to the tardy beam Of glaring Phebus, having, of her own, Glories enough to furnish out her crown. 118 So had the Corps of Sweets, if here it still Had slept: but Risen 'twas: yet pious They Find what was sent ingenuous faith to swell With satisfaction, and in full repay Their Odour's Price; for in the Tomb they see An Angel cloth'd in glittering Majesty. 119 This was that noble Spirit who in haste Flew down from Heav'n, just as thy Lord gat up; And on no errand but away to cast That Stone which did the Grave's confession stop; That these religious Visitants might read Their Lord's unfailing Word turn'd into Deed. 120 And gallantly his blessed work he did: For at his Coming's dint the Earth did quake; The Seal was startled and in pieces fled; The trimbling Stone was ready too to break; But courteous he vouchsaf'd to roll it by And bid it for his service quietly. 121 When lo the Watch which at the Sepulchre Guarded with swords and spears the High-priest's Sin; Saw that they past their own protection were, Being arrested by a Power divine: The Hills' Commotion reached all their hearts, Which, with the Seal, split in a thousand parts. 122 But chiefly at the Angel's Presence they Were overwhelmed in a flood of fright: His Robes were glorious as the morning's Ray, And partners with the driven Snow in White; For 'twas his Easter Suit, the Suit he had To honour this bright feast on purpose made. 123 And yet the Lustre which kept Holyday In his so pure so delicate Attire, Could not such wealthy Seas of Light display As streamed from his Aspect's mightier fire; For in his dreadfully majestick face A Spring of living Lightning bubling was. 124 In this celestial bravery his throne Taking upon the Stone he rolled thence, He his illustrious Terror darted on Those Sons of Mars; which they too weak to fence, Let fall their useless lamentable Steel, And after it Themselves confounded fell. 125 All flat and tame upon the ground they lay: For though they gladly would from thence have fled, Alas no Power they had to run away, Amazement having nail'd them there for dead. Thus they who stood to keep Life's Master down Sure in His Grave, were fitted for their own. 126 The Pair of Maries, when this Stranger there They spy'd, and all the Soldiers slain with Dread; In their sad Passion they began to share: And had not Innocence its shelter spread Over their hearts, this Apparition had An equal Conquest on their Spirits made. 127 But when the Angel mark'd their agony, He sweetly intercepted further fears: The fright concerns not honest you, said he, Which on those impious Watchmen domineers. I know your Errand well, (and here he smil'd, And all his face with gentler Lustre fill'd.) 128 You likewise come to Watch the Corps; but yet To Pray withal: You Jesus come to Oint, Although His Cross and Shame themselves have set Full in your way your loyal Mind to daunt. You bravely come, nor could the ruffian Guard You knew was ranged there, your haste retard. 129 You come to make your pious Day arise Here in this West in which your Titan set; You come to poure your Souls out at your eyes, And in Love's meekly-bold Profuseness wet The dry bed of your new-sown Master, who Charg'd all your Tears to wait on your own Wo. 130 Thus in couragious forgetfulness Of your faint Sex, you venter to attend Upon His body who forsaken is By all His masculine Scholars. I commend Your early valiant Zeal; although it be Arrived here too late your Hopes to see. 131 For Jesus earlyer was up than you, And unto slaughter'd Death bequeath'd His Tomb. His royal Word you know He pass'd; and now This Third prefixed Morning being come, Impossible it was that longer He In Death's cold region should frozen be. 132 If Doubts assault your faith, come in, and let Your eyes convince your hearts: His empty Bed You see, with all the Clothes and Sheets of it: A cold dead Bed; yet hence He flourished Into a sprightful Life, as noble He Sprung at the first from dry Virginity. 133 The Angel's words the holy Women read Plain in the Grave and in the Graveclothes; yet So deeply were their Souls astonished By these thick Wonders' Conflux, which beset Their unprovided Thoughts, that they surmise Some pleasing Error flattered their eyes. 134 So when old Jacob's unexpecting Ear The happy News did suddenly receive; What most would gratify his Wish to hear, He durst not when he heard it first, believe. In vain against the Tyding's stream he strives: His Spirits die to hear his Joseph lives. 135 At this the Angel sweetly chode their Doubt, Their jealous faintness, and dejected look; Demanding why they in Death's Closet sought Him who from thence to open Life was broke! Yet cheer'd them strait, and told them They should be The Angels of this News, as well as He. 136 Make haste to His Disciples, who, said He, As anxious of this bus'ness are as You; Bid them in pre-appointed Galilee Meet Him who promis'd there the Interview: And tell them, to anticipate their Doubt, That you from Me this cheerly Message brought. 137 Out went the pious Women in a sweet Distraction of loving fear and joy; The glorious Miracle did fear beget, The blessed News new Comfort did display: With doubtful Certainty they trembling ran, And made this sutable Relation: 138 Dear Sirs, O what, alas what shall we do! The only Relict of our Hopes is gone; But where our Lord's sweet Body is, or who Hath born it from the Tomb, God knows alone. We with these eyes the empty Grave beheld; Which us with terrible Amazement fill'd. 139 Indeed an Angel, if our Fancy did Not cheat our ears, pour'd Comfort on our Grief: He told us that our Savior from His Bed Of death was Risen; and to win belief, Quoted His own Prediction: but whate'r The matter is, our Hearts still beat with fear. 140 Us He commissioned to warn you All To Galilee; the Place in which, He saith, Your Risen Master's Apparition shall Requite th'Attendance of your pious faith. O that it might be so! though He had set Earth's furthest End for us that Joy to meet. 141 So spake the Women: but the standers by, Shak'd their wise heads at such unlikely News; And see, said they, the wild Credulity Of female Hearts, when fancies them abuse! How fine a story they can forge and fashion Of no Materials but Imagination! 142 Yet malgre this grim Censure; wiser John Fir'd at the News, thought not of Galilee, But in Love's loyal disobedience ran Hither, the present Miracle to see: The same spur prick'd on Peter's fervency, Who though he Doubted, would no more Deny. 143 Unto their Prey no Eagles e'r could post With speed more hearty; no Ambition make To Crowns and Scepters more impatient haste; No Spark to heav'n its venturous voyage take With braver zeal; than this religious Pair Flew to observe the empty Sepulchre. 144 But vivid John, in whose soft bosom reign'd More flames of youth and more of gallant Love, Quickly his Fellow-traveller outstrein'd In Ardor's race: in vain old Peter strove; For though his Tongue were always forward, yet John had the nimbler Heart and fleeter feet. 145 John first arrives: but strait arrested here With awful Reverence, only sends his eyes Into the bottom of the Cavern, where The Resurrection's Relicts he espies; The Linen Clothes, which had the grace to kiss The softer purer Skin of Daintiness. 146 But then his greedy panting follower, in The wonted Boldness of his hasty Zeal, Entred the Tomb, and made John's meekness win Such courage that to this dear Spectacle He ventur'd in, and with joint Wonder there Gaz'd and examined the Sepulchre. 147 They gaz'd and found the Grave that News attest Which Mary sighed had; their Lord was gone: But all His Linen furniture confest The bus'ness was in solemn order done; For they observed all the pieces lie Fairly disposed, and not tumbled by. 148 If Fraud or Rapin thence convey'd him, why Prey'd they not on the precious Linen too? Why lingred they to leave it orderly Wrap'd up and plac'd? About this Riddle so Demurr'd these puzzel'd Souls, forgetting that Not Wit, but Faith ought to unty the Knot. 149 At length with blind and anxious tears dismay'd They sigh'd, and scratch'd their heads, and home return'd. But Magd'lene who had thither follow'd, stay'd Still by the Tomb, to quench her heart which burn'd In Love's vast furnace: all the Springs which slept In both her Eyes, she bravely wak'd and wept. 150 She wept and pityed her prevented Spice, Which now breath'd short, and panting lay to see It came too late to be a Sacrifice To Odour's sweeter Lord: She wept that she, Her Tears' Drink-offring could present no more Upon His Feet's dear Altar as before. 151 She wept, to think she could no longer thence Sip Happiness by her adoring Kisses; Nor tender to her most indeared Prince The homage of her consecrated Tresses: Her Lips, and Locks, and Self, no longer seem Her own, because she cannot give them Him. 152 Had she the plenitude of whatsoe'r Th'idolatrous World adores, she still would be Poorer than naked Poverty, whilst here She nothing findeth but Vacuity; The Gem and Soul of her Content, which lay Treasur'd up here, alas was born away, 153 For ever born away, for ought she knew: And how can Mary live without her Life! No Mourning e'r so lamentably slew The Turtle's Joys in her disconsolate strife Of Love and Grief, when she her Mate had lost, As Mary's now a briney Tempest tost. 154 Yet having prefac'd by this flood; again She look'd to read fresh cause of further Tears: But in the Tomb she spy'd new Splendor reign. Two Angels ready to outshine her Fears, And dry her cheeks, had taken there their seat, One at the Monument's head, one at the feet. 155 They gorgeous were in festival array Round clothed in Joy's colour, milky White: Woman, what groundless ground makes you, said they, Becloud your brows in this fair scene of Light? Alas, cry'd she, what Light can ever cheer These eyes, whose Lord is laid I know not where! 156 Her Springs here gush'd a fresh, and back she turn'd To give their crouding streams full liberty: But Jesus's heart, which melted, as she mourn'd, And answered every Tear by sympathy; Could let her gentle Soul suspended be No longer in this anxious Agony. 157 For hither He in nimble goodness stept, That his dear Weeper's loyal eyes might see Their earned Spectacle: and, why she wept Was His soft Question, but blubber'd she, Blinded wth grief, could not discover who So courteously examined her Wo. 158 Thus Peter, when he was discharged by His guardian Angel from the gloomy Jail; Could neither apprehend the Courtesy, Nor who vouchsaf'd to be his wondrous Bail; But though himself his freedom did enjoy, His Soul's and Body's eyes close Pris'ners lay. 159 She took Him for the Gardner of the Place, And thus she sigh'd out her petition: Sir, If you have hence remov'd the Corps which was Interred here, O deign to tell me where Your haste has thrown 't aside; and I will strait For I at leisure am, upon it wait. 160 Mine, mine shall be the care and cost to lay That Jewel in some comely cabinet. Thus pleaded She: nor did her Error stray Quite from the truth; though 'twere her Master, yet It was that Gardner too, who planted all That grows about this universal Ball. 161 That Gardner, who betimes a-weeding fell, Ev'n in the virgin spring of His Creation: Th'encroaching Weeds, which on the heav'nly Hill Aspir'd to overgrow the new Plantation, Up by the roots He pluck'd in righteous ire, And threw them thence into eternal Fire. 162 That Gardner, who His lower Nursery, Planted on earth, vouchsaf'd to visit; where The pois'nous Sprouts of rank Impiety He tore away; and, with most matchless care, To make the Soil prove Fertile, every Bed Both with His Sweat and Blood He watered. 163 That Gardner, who contented was to let The Thorns upon His temples rather grow, Than they should vex the Grafts which He had set In His own bodie's Stock; that Gardner who Indeed had taken up, and born away What in the Tomb until this morning lay. 164 But pitying Magd'len's honest Sorrow, He Whose single potent Word all Clouds can clear, In Love's mild Tone,—the only Musick she Could cordially relish,—treats her ear: Yet His Salute was near as short as sweet, For only by her Name He her did greet. 165 Mary in Mary's ear no sooner sounded From Jesus's Lips, but to her breast it flew, And with incomparable joy rebounded Upon her wakened heart: She straitway knew The blessed Voice, and clearlyer by her ear Than by her eye she saw her Lord was there. 166 And sure her tender-temper'd Soul must now Have split with swelling triumph, had not she Unlockt it strait, and let it freely flow In torrents of exultant Piety: Her Love, her Life, her Heav'n, when least she thought, Were all at once to her fruition brought. 167 Which sudden Onset of complete Delight Most cruelly-delicious prov'd; for She Gasped and panted, and in joyous fright Staring upon her strange felicity, Cry'd Master: but no more; ecstatick Passion Quite stifeled all her following Oration. 168 Resolved therefore that her lips should now Speak for her Tongue's Aposiopesis, she Her self ambitiously prostrate threw And aim'd her Kisses at His Feet: but He Smiling reply'd, forbear to touch Me; I Have other bus'ness for thy Piety. 169 No haste, sweet Mary; my Ascension is At ample distance yet; and loving Thou Hereafter may'st present thy zealous Kiss: Go rather to My pensive-Brethren now, And let their Sorrow know that I intend Up to our common Father to Ascend. 170 At this Injunction Mary needs must go, Who on the Angel's errand went before; And yet her loyal Heart could not do so, But still behind would linger, to adore Her lost-found Lord: whom that she ne'r again Might loose, her Soul she to His Feet did chain. 171 Thus with the News she went, which ravish'd she A thousand times repeated by the way; And looked back as oft the place to see Where, when she left it, still she made her stay. So Bargemen struggle with the Tide, and though They one way look, yet they another row. 172 This Message startled His Disciples; but The Hubbub of the City mov'd them more: For by the Watchmen now the News had got Into the Town, and knock'd at every door: The Highpriests roused at the summons, call A common Council and to plotting fall. 173 Their heads they beat, and boulted every way How they their now endanger'd fame might save; What Mist might damp the Resurrection's day, And stop the open mouth of Jesus's Grave: They mused long, but could no trick contrive How He who lived might not seem to live. 174 For Belzebub, who us'd to have his Place In all their Councels, tardy came that day; His new-received Wound, and deep Disgrace Upon his vanquish'd heart with terror lay; Yet loth he was the Highpriests' Malice in His own dear Trade of Spight should him outrun. 175 He rais'd his head, and wiped off the gore: Three times he sighed, and three times he shook His broken head and horns; and then he swore By his own Might and Realm, that though the stroke Took him at unawares, yet Jesus had Howe'r He brav'd it out, no Conquest made. 176 And, had He been, said he, a generous fo, He would have pitch'd the day, and pitch'd the field; With trumpets' sound He would have marched to The fight, and not His sly Design conceal'd: He would have challeng'd Heav'n and Earth to be Spectators of His noble chevalry. 177 But lying to His fellow-thief, that He Would meet him strait in Paradise; by night He hither stole, and by base burglary Broke ope my doors: though We with open Might In our brave battle gave Him fairer play, Advancing in the face of Heav'n and Day. 178 'Twas at the best but a Surprise, and He Can only brag He found me too secure. A fault, I grant; but such a fault, as ye Can spy in none but those whose hearts assure Them that their Strength transcends the orb of fears. Let me but know't, and come He when He dares. 179 Here finding he could stretch his Tether to Jerusalem; lo all my fiends, he cry'd, You by this token instantly shall know How vain's that thievish Galilean's Pride. The foolish Carpenter forgot His trade When He this Chain to bind great Satan made. 180 This wretched Chain: which it shall serve to be The Tool of my Revenge; for back will I To Salem, where my ripened Victory Attends my Coming; never credit my Cunning or Power, if I these fetters lay Not on His Subjects, and hale home my Prey. 181 His goodly Doctrine 'tis, that they must take His yoke upon their necks; and for this once I care not if I patience have to make Them learn their Lesson; that the fools from hence May be assured whether I, or He Who said His yoke was light, most Lyar be. 182 Hell cheer'd by Belzebub's fresh courage, peep'd Forth from its timerous holes: when lo, its King To justify his lusty boasting, leap'd Up from his Den, and through Earth's bowels flung: But at his heels, besides his Tail's long train, He drew the longer volumes of his Chain. 183 Then cloth'd in unsuspicious Air, into The Sanhedrim he slips, and takes his seat Next to the plotting Highpriest's elbow: who Strait felt his brains with politick counsil beat. He little knew his Prompter was so near, Nor heard him when he whisper'd in his ear. 184 So well he lik'd the Plot he had conceiv'd, That confidently smiling, Sirs, said he, Think not this Cheater's Art has Us bereav'd Of Council's safe Reserve: it must not be, Whilst in this Consistory you assist, Whilst God is God, and Caiaphas is Priest. 185 Are We the Men, and these our Brains, which have So toss'd Him up and down; first to His Cross, Then out of Life, and then into His Grave? And should our wisdom now be at a loss! Or shall ignoble Nazareth outvy Our learned Salem's known Sagacity! 186 Full strange I grant the Soldiers' Story is, As in their staring eyes and startled hair Our selves too evidently read: but this Doth only for our Policy prepare More worthy matter, such as may befit The reverend Sanhedrim's profoundest Wit. 187 To us this noble Task belongs: for why Should We whose sacred honor 'tis to sit In mighty Moses's Chair, not verify Our Title to our Power, by proving it On Jannes's and on Jambres's Heir, who thus Affronteth Truth and Heavn's, in daring Us? 188 Indeed I hetherto believed that Magicians' Power with themselves had dy'd; But since this one Example tells me what I ne'r could learn from all the World beside; We must resolve, e'r it too rank be grown, This Conjuration to conjure down. 189 If We to salve our Credit's Soar should find No Cunning's Balme, the Romans would deride That violent Zeal in which we all combin'd To get this Galilean crucify'd; And Pilate o'r our Guilt would triumph that His hands he washed from this bloody Blot. 190 Nay our own Bandogs too, the wide-mouth'd Crew, Whose shameless Bawling brought about our Plot, May turn their boistrous Throats at Us who blew Their Rage's coals: sure they will ne'r be got To serve us with a Second Roar, if in The first they learn that they have cheated been. 191 My final Counsil therefore is, that We From our own Purses raise our last Recruit. Believe it, Money's of that Potency That Miracles themselves cannot confute. Sure you have not forgot how strange a feat Poor thirty silver pieces wrought of late. 192 And if that silly Sum so strongly wun His own Disciple's heart; compute what may By fair well-limbed and fat Bribes be done Upon this mercenary Guard, since they Have no Relation, nor no Reason why They should be tender to maintain a Ly. 193 I say, a Lye: and if you scruple't, pray Remember 'tis the way in which we went When witness we suborn'd Him to destroy Whom Truth could not impeach: but our Intent You know, aim'd only to assert our Law, And therefore then 'twas good; and may be now. 194 To you I speak who in our Sacred Writ No Strangers are: you know what Abraham did, And Jsaac too, when Need exacted it In Gerar's Court; what David when he fled To Nob, and Gath: and if the Saints may ly, Who dares that Privilege to Us deny? 195 Yet let me say 't, Selfe's not so dear to me That with the cost of one Untruth I 'd buy My Life's reprieve: but now we clearly see Our whole Religion at the stake doth lie; Why should we by unthrifty Thrift be drawn To loose God's Truth, that we may keep our own? 196 Fear not, sage Brethren, God Himself allows These Dispensations: for otherwise He in requital had not built an House To shelter th'old Egyptian Midwives' Lyes. Indeed to th'People Truth we preach; for why, Dull Souls, they know not when 'tis fit to Ly. 197 Since then the Soldiers' Mouths no less are ope Than Jesus's Grave, the surest course will be Them with the thickest stiffest Clay to stop; This is the only Bung and Seal which we Can clap upon them: and you need not doubt That Truth will ever through this Dam burst out. 198 We 'l bid them say, and if need urge them, swear, That whilst their tedious Watching made them nod, His Scholars, who in ready ambush were, Favour'd by silent Night, the boldness had To take their Master's Corps away by theft, Though they the shrowd in craft behind them left. 199 To them our Promise too we 'l pawn, that we Will blanche the bus'ness so with Pilate, as To shield them from his frown: plain Equity Indeed ingageth us to make their case Our own, and with some forgery defend Those who by Lyes our Laws and Us befriend. 200 When thus their cheating Oracle had spoke; His Counsil highly pleas'd, and every one Into Applause and Acclamation broke In glad presumption that the Feat was done. In were the Soldiers call'd again, and told What they must do; and forthwith shew'd the Gold. 201 As when their Mirrours cunning Fowlers set, Whose gaudy lustre plays about the air; The silly Birds regardless of the Net, Are suddenly inamor'd of those fair But fatally-insidious Baits, and fly With chirping joy to their captivity: 202 So by the Gold's inchanting splendor They Tickled and ravish'd, gladly undertake Their cursed Task; and snatching up their Pay, Into the Streets with full-mouth'd Lyes they break, Railing, and banning His Disciples for Their stealing Jesus from His Sepulchre. 203 'Twas not one quarter of an hour, that we Borrow'd to ease our heavy eyes; and yet So dextrous were they in their Thievery, They catch'd that very cue to compass it. Let all, they cry'd, who long complete to be In Pilfering, go to School in Galilee. 204 The credulous Vulgar, without more ado Imbrac'd the News, and spread it all abroad, And still that Slander has the luck to go Current among the Jews; who though to God, The God of Truth, they will no Credit give, These hired Lyars readily believe. 205 And time may come, when Albion's woful eye Shall see this Madness plainly copied out; When Lyes alone shall be adored by The strange wild Faith of its plebian Rout; Who sooner will believe what Soldiers preach, Than what ev'n Angels or Apostles teach. 206 But as the timorous Disciples now In cautious Privacy's dark nest lay hid; Their tender Master so contrived how To manifest His Risen Self: indeed In Galilee He promis'd to appear, But He cannot their Joy so long defer. 207 He with His Company an holy Pair Had at Emmaus entertain'd to day; Where, as He brake the sacred Bread, He tare From their beclouded eyes the veil away: And with like favour now He hastes to cheer His sad and thoughtful Friends assembled here. 208 Here, where the Doors all being made as fast As locks and bars and fear could charm them; He Whose sprightful Body through His tomb had past, Entred the house with like facility. They slander'd were abroad for stealing Him, But now He truly steals at home on Them. 209 Yet, as excessive unexpected Bliss Swallows up dazell'd Faith in Ravishment; So His Disciples all amaz'd at this Strange Apparition, mutually bent Their frighted eyes, and held their hands on high, Confounded in a silent Ecstasy. 210 But Comfort's King unlocking then His sweet And gracious Lips, Peace be among you, said; My Promise I in love prevent; O let Not Love by being wing'd, make you afraid: 'Tis I, 'tis I; observe you not these wide Tokens both in my Hands and Feet and Side? 211 Why fancy you, that you some Spirit see? These Mouths proclaim as much as I profess: You know a Spirit cannot wounded be, Nor wear such Marks of humane Passiveness. Come handle Me, and be assured well If not of what you see, of what you feel. 212 But this Probation shin'd so fully, that It struck their Apprehension blind: away The mighty Torrent snatch'd their thoughts, and shot Them all into the gulf of trembling Joy. Thus those who gaze on Phebus, cannot see Him for his too much Visibility. 213 So strange a thing's faint Hope, if unawares It be surpris'd by full Fruition, that In fond ambiguous Jealousy, it bars Out what it do's possess; and aiming at Some proofs of what is absolutely clear, Transfigureth it self from Hope to Fear. 214 But Jesus, their amazement to allay, Grew more familiar, and call'd for Meat: And of a Fish and Honycomb, which they Present Him with, disdaineth not to eat. Though Paradise its Sweets for Him prepar'd, He this plain Diet with His friends preferr'd. 215 ('Tis not the costly Taste of far-fetch'd Fare, Nor all the Kitchen's aromatick Art, That can embrave the Rellish of the Cheer To entertain the Palate of the Heart. Friends friends alone make Feasts indeed; whose meats Though coarse, their sauce flows with the soul of sweets.) 216 Then kindly angry He to Chiding fell That all this while their Doubt would not repent, Though of His Resurrection's Miracle He by eye-witness frequent Proof had sent. He Chode; but with such rare and dainty art, That every Wound He made, was with Love's Dart. 217 This done; His Peace to them again He gave; That Peace He purchas'd when He trampled down Hell into Hell, and Death into the Grave: When He seren'd His Father's gloomy Frown; When Heav'n and Earth's wide Disagreement He Clos'd up, and chang'd to blessed Amity. 218 Then breathing on Them with that noble Breath Which kindled Life's first Spark in Humane Heart; The dearest Gift, said He, which ever hath To Man been deign'd, I here to you impart: 'Tis Heav'n's all-holy Spirit, which shall now With mighty fervor in your bosoms glow. 219 Henceforth, whose Sins soever You Remit, By this great Patent I My self Forgive; And whom you Bind to Death's infernal Pit, They from your Doom shall purchase no Reprieve. As Me My Father sent, so send I you To be My potent Deputies below. 220 This said; into Invisibility He shut His Bodie's looks, and so withdrew. Yet They on Love's wings Him persu'd, and by Faith's Perspective still kept their Joy in view; Ten thousand blessings powring on His Name Who drown'd their Sorrow's flood in Comfort's stream. 221 But Thomas, who mean time was step'd aside, Returning now; they met him at the door Shouting into his ears the News's tide; Their Lord's great Promises they o'r and o'r With every Circumstance at large repeat, And how He shew'd His Wounds, and how He Eat. 222 Thomas amaz'd at their Relation, stood Staring a while, and musing what to say In opposition of that swelling flood Of most unanimous Confidence, which they Stream'd forth upon his Incredulity; At last he stamp'd, and cry'd, It cannot be. 223 Indeed the foul-mouth'd Souldiers rave, and cry That We have stoll'n our Master from His Grave; Perhaps, to shelter their own Theft, and by Calumniating Us, Themselves to save. But can bold Death repent, and free Him whom She held close Pris'ner in a rocky Tomb? 224 I grant your Fancy may do much, and you Perchance imagin all is true you say; But Sirs, is 't reason my Belief should bow To your Imaginations? you may By Probabilities persuade me far; But I no glimpse of them discover here. 225 I am not so much wiser now at Night Than I was in the Morn, as to admit What then to your own Prudence seem'd so slight That you no less than I rejected it: Why must it real prove in you, which all Of Us in Magdelen judg'd Fantastical! 226 When with these Eyes those Wounds I have descry'd, And div'd my Finger where the Nails went through: When I have thrust my Hand into His Side, And felt that in it no Impostures grow; I of your mind may be: at present give Me leave not at a venture to Believe. 227 At least let's sleep on't first; a good night's Rest May wake and cheer up our Consideration: We better may the Day, than Darkness trust With so abstruse a Mystery's Probation. Or if you be in haste, yet grant that They Who would be sure, may soberly delay. 228 (Thus Heav'n in Love and Wisdom thought it fit To let thick Clouds of Doubt objected be Before the Resurrection's Truth, that it Might fairer break from that Obscurity; And pierce all Hearts of cold and faithless Stone As it the Marble of the Tomb had done.) 229 Eight days in this imprudent Prudence he Lay petrify'd: when lo, again their Lord Through all their lock'd and bolted Privacy To them His Presence pleased to afford: Whose sprightful Coming, though it made them start, Perplex'd not as at first their roused heart. 230 But Thomas, unto whom the Sight was new, Afflicted stood with quaking Joy and Fear: His Master's matchless Looks he plainly knew, And yet his fancies odd and anxious were: He blush'd, and then grew pale, and blush'd again, And gave cross Passions at once the rein. 231 When Jesus saw him on this dainty rack Tort'ring his shamed Soul; Draw near, He said, And thine own Satisfaction freely take; Lo here My Wounds before thine Eyes display: Repierce thou them; 'twill not be so much grief, As to be wounded by thy Unbelief. 232 This Condescent so conquer'd Thomas's heart, That full Assurance threw him on his knees, And thus he cry'd: My God and Lord Thou art; Not only by those wide-mouth'd Witnesses Thy Servant is convinc'd, but also by The Heav'nly Sweetness of Thy Lenity. 233 I find that Thou eight days ago wert here When foolish I so faithlesly was wise; Thou heard'st my obstinate Distrust outdare The pregnant Witness of my fellows' eyes. Thou heard'st what bold Conditions I set Before my faith their Story should admit. 234 O I believe dear Lord, and ready am Thy Wounds to answer, and the like to bear In spreading forth the glories of Thy Name About the furthest Worlds as well as here: Pardon my tardy faith; it doth suffice That I have felt those Tokens with mine eyes. 235 I see, I see, and my Beatitude Doth in this noble Vision consist: see my God; and though my Thoughts were rude Before, and stubborn; melted now, their best And humblest Adoration, Jesu, they At Thy dear feet most penitently lay. 236 His Lord reply'd: Thou build'st thy faith upon Thine eyes; (and happy 'tis thou canst do so:) But in how full a Stream shall Blessings run Into their pliant docil Bosoms, who Ne'r saw these deep-writ Characters, and yet Shall to the Credit of their Truth submit! 237 This said, He stepp'd into His Secresy, And vanish'd from their wondering sight; but yet With frequent love returned to their eye As His divinely-wisest self thought fit: Yet with most eminence on Tabor's Hill, A comely Scene for that high Spectacle. 238 But not transfigur'd, as before; for now His proper shape was radiant Majesty: From dull and mortal Dross refin'd, you know, Out of His Tomb He sprang; nor needed He That Heav'n should ope its mouth to trumpet forth A Testimony of His splendid Worth. 239 This was that solemn Apparition He On Easter Morn by Mary promised, That this appointed Theatre might be With plenty of Spectators furnished: And so it was; for His Disciples thither Five hundred trusty friends had brought together. 240 When lo their Hopes they met upon the Mount, And more, much more, than their Ambition's aim: For Jesus op'd His lips, and let the fount Of potent Sweetness liberally stream; Which in the chanel of these Words upon The Heads and Hearts of His Disciples ran: 241 The Nerves and Sinews of all Power and Might Which branch through Heav'n and Earth so far and wide, Here in this single Hand of Mine unite, And to My royal Will alone are ty'd; By virtue of which Sovereignty I Commit to you complete Authority. 242 Go take your Charge; whose noble bounds I make Coequal with the World's: My Gospel preach To every Soul, whose Bliss to reach them back, I on the cursed Cross My self did stretch; That in as large a Circle as the Sun The more illustrious Beams of Grace may run. 243 Whoe'r despiseth your great News, and You, Shall answer with his Life that high Disdain, And find his flaming Punishment below In Desperation's everburning Pain: But He who to your faith his own shall give, As long's that other Dying is, shall Live. 244 Live, and in Life's own dearest bosom, where All Joys and Blisses have their habitation; Where no intrusion of Storms can tear The gentle Calm of absolute Salvation: Where his fruition shall as far transcend As here his faith, all he can comprehend. 245 Nor shall his Glory only future be; Miraculous Power shall here on him attend; Upon the stoutest boldest Devils he Shall invocate My Name, and make them bend: From humane breasts his Word shall them expel, And force them howling home unto their Hell. 246 Babel's Confusion shall not him confound, But every Tongue on his distinctly dwell That he My Gospel freely may resound, And every Ear with plain Salvation fill; I who created it, as eas'ly can With Words as Meat, supply the Mouth of Man. 247 In vain shall Scorpions bite him, and in vain Shall Adders sting him; he as certainly Over all Serpents here on earth shall gain As over Hell's foul Dragon, victory: By those mysterious Stings which I endured, He from their dangerous dint shall be secured. 248 In vain shall Poison steal into his cup An ambush for his life to lay; for he Cannot, though Basilisks' galls he drinketh up, Or Sodom's Lake, a prey to Venome be: That Cup which on My Cross I drank shall make Wholsome to him what ever Draughts he take. 249 More Virtue than in Plants could ever grow, Shall flourish in his Hand; the World shall see Those whom on desperate Beds Diseases throw, Thence into Health rebound, if once they be But touch'd by him whose faith on Me relies: The grand Physician of all Maladies. 250 But his Initiation must be By being washed in the potent Name Of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that He His orthodox Devotion right may aim; Remembring he by Baptism unto none Was consecrated, but the triple One. 251 So spake their mighty Lord; and then withdrew Himself to let them feed and feast upon These Heav'nly Privileges He granted now To Earth, by faithful Meditation. Right dear He knew His Presence was, and yet He by Retiring more endeared it. 252 The tender Lover thus with dainty art From his more precious Self sometimes retires; Alas not that he willing is to Part, But that more near Conjunction he desires; For love in Absence oft most Present is, And her soft Knot by Distance closer ties. 253 But now the signal Time was come, when He Who cheer'd the Earth for forty days with His Bright Apparitions, meant that Heav'n should be Embellish'd with His glorious Access; That as Himself He nobly raised hither, So He might reach His Resurrection thither. 254 His precious Consorts now again He met; And then, as loth ev'n unto Heav'n to go From their Society, to Olivet He walk'd them on with kind Discourse: When lo, Upon the mountain's top arrived, He Began in Tone and Aspect chang'd to be. 255 Stir not, said He, from Salem, but attend The Father's Promise pawn'd to you by Me: That Baptism, whose strange Virtues far transcend John's poor and frigid Institution; He Baptiz'd with Water, but your Baptism shall In Heav'n's sweet Spirit of fire immerge you all. 256 Erected at this solemn Item, They Fancy'd no less than Crowns and Scepters: yet Their erring Thoughts below the Promise lay, Hankring in Earth's dull sphere, and reaching at No more than what too worthless was for Him Their great Ascendent Lord to leave to them. 257 We know, said they, that Israel's sacred Crown Is due to Thy sole Head, most fit for it: Is this the Time dear Lord when Thou wilt own And make Thy Title good? Shall we now sit On our inferior Thrones before Thy feet, And to the Tribes of Israel judgment meet? 258 (Long Journeys thus when prudent Parents take, Though they their shiftless Babes their Blessing leave, And for their maint'nance fair provision make; The fond dull-hearted Children further crave Some silly trifling Boon, or baby Toy, Follie's delight, and Wantonesses' joy.) 259 Jesus, who at His parting could not chide, Passing their gross and secular fancies by, With true parental Gentleness reply'd: Those Times and Seasons which inshrined lie In God's own cabinet, too mystick be For you to dive into their Privacy. 260 Yet Courage, O my friends! for clearly you Ten thousand other Mysteries shall see, By that bright Spirit's light which down shall flow On all your heads: Your Glory then shall be To go as Heralds, and My royal Name Through every Quarter of My World proclaim. 261 This said; to Heav'n three times His eyes He cast; Which thence as oft recoiled back upon His deep-amused Darlings: yet at last Remembring He could both be here and gone, His mighty voyage He resolv'd to make, And His Disciples leave, but not forsake. 262 Hast thou not seen the glittering Spark Ascend With natural Lightness to its proper sphere? So glorious He, now having put an end To all His sweet and blessed Business here; Upon the Wings of His own Purity Began to mount up to His native sky. 263 They started at the sight, and both with eyes And hands flung up in sudden fearful Joy, Labour'd to trace His wonderous Path, and rise After their towring Lord, who flew away With all their hearts: When lo they spy'd a Cloud 'Gin 'twixt their Ecstasy and Him to croud. 264 It crouded on apace, for fear to miss That honor which its gloomy cheeks would gild With more refin'd celestial Statelyness That on Serenity's brisk forehead smil'd. So fast it crouded, that the tired Wind Which would have born it, puffing came behind. 265 All other Clouds which her Prerogative saw Grew black with Grief, and melted into tears: Forthwith the Welkin clear'd her dainty brow, Whilst pleasant Day with open eyes prepares Her Admiration to gaze upon The motion of a fairer sweeter Sun. 266 But then this Meteor her soft shoulders bent, And meekly stooped to her Maker's feet; Her pliant Volumes gathered close, and went Into the fashion of a Princely Seat; That in a seemly Chariot Jesus might Take to His Throne His most triumphant Flight. 267 The Golden Coach inchas'd with eastern Gems And burnished with living Fire, wherein Great Phebus in his brightest glory swims Through Heav'n's high chanel, never yet could shine With such clear credit, as this Chariot which God's own enshrined Beauties here inrich. 268 All other Clouds at every busy Wind's Shrill whistle, in this nether troubled sky Are fain wildly to rove: this only finds An undisturbed passage fair and high, And strait to heav'n's illustrious Ceeling hastes Without the helping wheels of any Blasts. 269 For since at first she by the courtesy Of heav'n's less potent Sun impowred was To rise from earth with towring levity; No wonder She can now more briskly pass Through all the Air's sublimest stories, when She on her shoulders bears the Sun's own Sun. 270 Earth was indebted to those Clouds, till now Which op'd Heav'n's Pantry, and rain'd Manna down; But This full Pay doth to the Spheres allow, Which to the Angels beareth home their own Diviner Bread, and by restoring more Than Earth received, nobly quits the score. 271 That Israel-conducting Cloud which through The tedious Desert's windings mannaged So patient a Pilgrimage, must bow Its famous head to This: that only led The way to earthly Canaan, but this The gallant Convoy to the heav'nly is. 272 As Jesus thus soard through the Air, He saw The Treasuries of every kind of Weather, Of fair, of foul, of Rain, of Hail, of Snow; Which did their homage to their Prince as thither His coach arriv'd: He bad them gently fall Upon His Earth, and kindly blest them all. 273 So did He too, that sweetly-loyal Quire Of Larks, which with applauding Songs and Wings In delicate attendance did aspire After His mounting Train: Go gentle Things Said He, go rest your weary pinions; I My other Choristers approaching spy. 274 Lo, at the word, the winged Legions, who Flutter about the everlasting Sphere, And on the great Creator's errands go Throughout His World, appeared hovering there: Great was their number, and their glory great If they with Jesus's lustre had not met. 275 Before His Feet their Heads made haste to bow, Press'd down with sweet extremities of joy; That they without a Vail's assistance now His eyes' full Bliss might read, which till to day Lay hid to them in too much light; but here Dressed in humane mitigation were. 276 For though some of their Quire had long before Enjoy'd the happy privilege to see His theanthropick Face; though All did poure Their high Applause on His Nativity; This was the hour which Heav'n's whole Host at once Freely to view their General did advance. 277 A dainty and long-study'd Song they had Prepar'd and tuned to a gentle Key: But this excessive Sight of Sweetness made Their Acclamations correspondent be: Their Wings and Hands aloud they clap'd, and rent With louder Pæans all the Element. 278 But marking then His bright Retinue, which About Him shin'd like His reflected Raies; They hug'd their new Acquaintance, since in each Ingenuous face they read their Sovereign's Praise; For Gratitude had deep imprinted there Their glorious Redemption's Character. 279 These were those holy Souls who long had lain At anchor in great Abraham's Bay, and there Looked and longed when their Lord would deign Them to their final Port of rest to steer; To chase their Mists and Shades with His own Ray, And turn their doubtful Dawn to Highnoon Day. 280 Abraham himself march'd in the head of them, And glittered with a choise and leading Grace; Prophets were rank'd, and Patriarchs next to Him Each in their proper dignity and place: Then every Saint in order follow'd, who Ventur'd in His hard Steps on earth to go. 281 Their Charges many Guardian Angels saw, And highly triumph'd to behold them there: So when the Bark which long hath labour'd through The Sea's proud Anger, to the Hav'n draws near, The Pilot's eyes and heart with joy are fill'd No less than with the Winds his Sails are swell'd. 282 But all the Host beheld a fair Recruit Of their own Regiments, which robbed were When sullen Pride, presuming to dispute With God, in heav'n's campania waged War, And many Empyræan Tapers fell From Blisse's Day into the Night of Hell. 283 Yet greater Torrents of Delight were they Which through the æstuating bosoms ran Of all those Saints, to see themselves to day To Glory's Sovereign so near of kin. They envy not the Angels' radiant Dresses, Nor wish their silver Wings, or golden Tresses. 284 O no! they thank their mean Original, And pour applause on their poor Dust and Clay: Their Shame's their Honor; nor would they for all The World not have been Worms, since mortal they Have by their Vileness gain'd the best of Worth, Affinity with Heav'n ev'n by their Earth. 285 And that their Triumph might be sweetned by Harmonious Joy, amidst the Masculine Troop Great David let his learned fingers fly About his Harp, and beat those Accents up Which Miriam's Timbril echoed from among Her softer Company, the Female Throng. 286 But now the Brightness too excessive grew For that faint Cloud its mighty flames to bear: And nothing that did like a Shadow shew In open Glory's Substance might appear: As all the Types before were cleared, so The Cloud must be content to vanish too. 287 Here Jesus her dismiss'd. When lo a Croud Of Seraphs in ambition of her place With humble pride su'd to His foot, and bow'd Their youthful shoulders, that their Lord might pass To heav'n upon the best of heav'n, and be Drawn to His Throne in comely Majesty. 288 Then Michael flourishing the Standard, which With conquer'd Death's and Hell's heart-blood was red, And charged with the Cross, began to stretch It toward heav'n, and forward fluttered. In this Array the Triumph marched on, Abashing Day, and dazelling the Sun. 289 Thus He who lately that Procession went Where cruel Spight and Scorn did Him attend, When He through Salem's streets was kick'd and rent, And through a thousand Deaths hal'd to His End; Is now requited by a March, whose Glory Gilds those Disgraces of His Passion's Story. 290 As to the Confines of the spheres they drew, His Harp and Voice their Chanter strein'd as high That ancient Song of Honor to renew, Which he had in prophetick Ecstasy Turn'd to a special and illustrious Lay, And sung aforehand to this noble Day. 291 Eternal Gates of heav'n, said he, lift up Your cheerly heads, and know your Holyday; As mine is now, so let your mouths be ope To entertain our universal Joy: 'Tis Glory's, Glory's native King, who home To bring That and the sweeter Heav'n is come. 292 'Tis War's approved Prince, whose matchless strength Hath trode down our and your fell enemies: Read but His Banner, where are writ at length The ruby Tokens of His Victories. Ope, ope, as wide's your heav'n can give you leave, And Him much greater than all it, receive. 293 The crystal Doors no sooner heard the Song, But in obedient gladness echoed it; Their everlasting Bars aside they flung, And their resplendent Portals open set: Strait through the mighty Gap a Flood of Gold Soft as the locks of Phebus downward roll'd. 294 With that the Musick of the Spheres burst out, Pouring a Deluge of soul-ravishing Layes: With which a while though David's fingers fought, His mortal strings so high he could not raise; My Harp must yield, he cry'd, but yet my Heart Shall in your loftiest Accents bear her part. 295 Indeed those Airs are so refin'd, that none But purest Hearts' spiritual Strings can be Stretch'd to their chords' full compass: this alone That Consort is, to which the Melody You with the Name of Musick honor here, Is only learned Gratings of the ear. 296 Thus to the silver Orbs they came: when lo The Stars all trip'd about, and danc'd for joy; And as his Sphere the Triumph enter'd, to His Lord right meekly Sol resign'd the Day; His brighter Lord, from whose original Beam He takes his Light as all the Stars from Him. 297 But yet these gorgeous Stages only were The fairly paved Way and Stairs, which led Up to that fairer larger Palace, where Dwells Light and Life, and Bliss, and Heav'n indeed: And therefore Jesus through all these made haste, And only blest and gilt them as He past. 298 When to the Crest of His Creation He Was now arriv'd, and saw the World below; The mighty Gate of pure Felicity It self before its Sovereign open threw: Of living Glories strait appear'd a Sea Girt in no shoars but clear Immensity. 299 What pompous Powers of Ravishment were here, What delicate Extremities of Pleasure! Th'unworthy Parallel injurious were By earthly Paradise if we should measure These everlasting Sweets, of whose Abyss All Eden's Dainties not the Shadow is. 300 For never did the sharpest pointed Eye Which sparkled in the head or heart of Man Such Miracles of Suavity descry, As all about these splendid Regions ran; Chanting those Tunes of Bliss no mortal ear Hath any capability to hear. 301 And all these Gallantries enhanced now Their Excellence in most excessive Joy; That this great Hour was come which would allow Them freedom their ambitious selves to lay In His triumphant Path, and nobler be By waiting on His sweeter Majesty. 302 But through these vast Expansions as He went, Lo His Almighty Father came to meet Him: O Psyche hadst thou seen that Complement Of boundless Love with which He there did greet Him; The Spectacle for ever thee had blest, And more than heav'n diffused in thy breast. 303 Unfathomable Streams of Jubilation Attended on Him, bearing up His Train; A Flood of most excessive Gratulation Before Him roll'd; but O how sovereign Was that impatient Infinity Of Complacence which issued from His Eye! 304 On's Son's bright neck his radiant Arms He threw, And seal'd His lips with an enamor'd Kiss: His yearning bosom then wide open flew (That Home and Center of eternal Bliss;) To bid Him welcome to that daintiest bed In which He us'd of old to rest His head. 305 Come, come, said He, no more to part from hence; My highest Will Thou hast completely done, And by Perfection of Obedience Approv'd Thy worthy Self My only Son. Eternity shall entertain Thee, and For Thy dear sake Those who about Thee stand. 306 Henceforth I can behold My World below With comfort, which before displeas'd Mine eye; For all its blots and stains, and horrors Thou Hast nobly turned into Purity: It shineth now, wash'd by the liberal Flood Of Thine illustrious all-cleansing Blood. 307 I see Thy Wounds; and I observ'd the Shame With which they were engrav'd on Thee; but now With never-dying Lustre they shall flame, And on their Gravers one day Terror throw; When guilty they again shall view these Scars Thou purchasedst in Love's and Mercy's Wars. 308 The Father so: But then the Holy Ghost Who hand in hand along with Him was come, Renewed His applauding Joy; whilst most Mysterious Emanations issuing, from His breast, Love's Living Spring, flow'd full upon The welcome face of Heav'n's returned Son. 309 The surplusage of which Effusion, spread Its aromatick preciousness about, And with its bounteous Tide replenished Th'enobled Hearts of Them whom Jesus brought In triumph thither, evermore to be The glorious Captives to Felicity. 310 This Salutation done: Heav'n's Trumpets sounded: Whose gallant Noise, with equal Majesty That Hill of all Sublimity rebounded, To which this more than royal Company Hastned their pompous March, and strait gat up To clear Beatitude's and Honor's Top. 311 Three radiant Chairs of awful beauty there Stand founded on secure Eternity; Which with such mystick art united are That 'tis intirely One, as well as Three; Three equal and distinguish'd Seats, yet one Essential and everlasting Throne. 312 Down in the midst the Father sate, and on His left hand His all-quickning Spirit; but He at His right enthron'd His mighty Son; On whose fair Temples He rejoycing put A Wreath of Glories, to requite those Scorns And Pains they ware with their late Crown of Thorns. 313 The ignominy of His feeble Reed With solid Dignity to recompence, Into His right Hand He delivered A Scepter temper'd of Omnipotence; And then erected high before His face His fairer Cross upon a diamond Base. 314 As thus He mounted sate on Triumph's Crown, The Peers of that illustrious Kingdom came And at His feet their Coronets threw down In loyal homage, and themselves with them; Begging His leave that their unworthy Tongues Might with His royal Name enrich their Songs. 315 The gracious King (who knew no Praise could add To His enthroned Self; but that the Bliss Would be their own alone, who to their God Offer'd encomiastick Sacrifice;) To ease and crown their gravid Piety Grants their Request by His assenting Eye. 316 Forthwith an Anthem of ecstatick Praise Broke from their lips and Heav'n's roof nobly beat: This brave Example spur'd the Saints to raise Their highest Tunes, and mingle in that sweet Deluge of Triumphs their Applauses, which Must flow as far's Eternity can reach. 317 But His Disciples, Psyche, all this while Follow'd Him with their eyes: for loth they were To let the interposing Cloud beguile Their Looks' sharp Hunger; nor could they forbear Their Gazing still, in hopes their Sun might break This Veil at length, and they free prospect take. 318 When lo, two Angels all array'd in Snow A courteous check thus to their Error gave: Your Eyes in vain why do you upward throw? What mean your ignorant staring Hopes, to crave A sight of Him who's towred higher far Above the Cloud than you beneath it are? 319 He on His Heav'nly throne is pitch'd, and you Must wait, till thence He thinks it fit to rise: 'Twill not be long e'er He vouchsafe to show To yours and all the World's His royal Eyes; And, as His journey hence He pleas'd to take, So on the shoulders of a Cloud ride back. 320 Which said: the Angels posted home to share In their new festival above: and they Convinced by that Item, yielding were Back to Jerusalem to take their way; But as their eyes returned to the ground The final footsteps of their Lord they found. 321 And so may thy Affection too, for lo The precious Characters still here remain; The trusty Earth would never let them go, Nor durst desire to smooth her face again, Which by these Prints was so embellish'd that Her self to be the World's Base she forgot. 322 These dear Impressions his Disciples kisst, And taking so their leave, to Salem went; Full little thinking that the simple Dust In keeping them would prove so diligent, That neither Winds nor Storms should them deface, Nor pious Pilgrims bear them from the place. 323 A thousand greedy Hands their zeal have fill'd With this most privileg'd Earth, and held it more Golden than all the glistering Sand which swell'd The fame of Ganges or of Indus's shoar; Yet still the faithful Dust with nimble care Supply'd and kept intire each Character. 324 Nay when that Time shall come, as come it will, When Christian Piety shall courage take To rear a Temple on this sacred Hill; Proof of their holyer Worth these Steps shall make. Refusing to forget the Honor they Were sealed with upon Ascension Day. 325 Back will they kick into the Workman's face All his entrenching Stones, as oft as he With pavement's smoothness strives to trim the place, And injure with his earthly decency Their Heav'nly beauty; yea though he with more Than Gold, or Pearls, or Gems should court the floor. 326 Nor shall he with his strongest Roof forbid Their prospect towards His celestial Seat Who stamp'd them here: their Eyes will know no Lid, But make the beams recoil, the spars retreat, And never suffer bold Concameration To dam the way of Jesus's Exaltation. 327 Thus Psyche, have I made thee trace thy Lord To His last footsteps through a thousand ways With Mercy strew'd, and justify'd my word. Thou seest what Countermures He deign'd to raise Against Sin's Batteries; nor need'st thou fear Hell's Spight, now Heav'n thus arms thee for the War. 328 For surely it transcends all fancie's reach To think ev'n what Desire could further do; And these are those divine Exploits by which His causeless foes thy Spouse contriv'd to woo: Who signally deserves all Love, since He Has prov'd His great Self nothing else to be. 329 Nor durst I doubt, but thine own heart will say Thy Pilgrimage, though long, is well requited; Since thou in it hast read a full Display Of that with which all Angels are delighted. Whose Souls then with sublimest triumph leap When on these Mysteries of Love they peep. 330 Here Phylax on his Steeds their harness threw Who all this while were grazing on the Hill: The meaning of that Warning Psyche knew, And pray'd him on her knee, to tarry till Like other Pilgrims She had taken leave The reins to her Devotion to give. 331 He smil'd and stay'd: when falling prostrate She Innumerable Kisses heap'd upon The venerable Steps; and amorously Mingled with every Kiss a Tear and Grone. At length her Bosom with the Dust she fill'd, And cry'd Go thou and my foul body gild. 332 Then casting up to Heav'n her zealous eye, After her Spouse a thousand thoughts she sent; To whom her panting Soul strove hard to fly Upon the wings of lofty Ravishment. But when she felt her self stick still to Earth, Her breast she struck, and beat this Out-cry forth. 333 Why may my heart not be, where most it is O Thou my dearest Life! O Jesu, why Since Thou art mounted to the Top of Bliss, And leav'st Me dead, have I not leave to Die? A Ghost so straitned was there ever found As I, who am in my own body bound. 334 I by Thy Cross and Death was wholly slain, And by Thy Resurrection's Life I grew No less intirely vigorous again: But Thy Ascension doth my Death renew, Since nothing of my Life poor I can find But these bare footsteps left Me here behind. 335 By these Thy Psyche cannot cannot live, Though for Thy precious sake they 'r such to me: O no! their Worth doth but more reason give To long for most inestimable Thee. If any footstep me can satisfy It must be that which next Thy foot doth lie. 336 Hast not profess'd, that Earth Thy footstool is As well as Heav'n Thy Throne? O mighty Lord 'Twill be Thy Handmaid's most accomplish'd Bliss If thou to Me mak'st good Thy gracious Word: Lo I, Thy Dust, the footstool crave to be Of Thy now Heav'n-enthroned Majesty. 337 High my Petition is, and bold, I know; And yet the worthless Dew must needs aspire To Heav'n it self, when once it 'gins to glow With Phebus's sprightful and attracting Fire; Can Sparks in their dull Ashes sleeping lie, And not take leave to venture at the sky? 338 Alas, what is this weary World to me? What are the silver Spheres and golden Sun? Though Queen I reign'd of Earth's vast Monarchy, At my sole Nod though all Heav'n's wheels would run; What were this Empire worth to Psyche's heart Since Thou her only Treasure absent art? 339 'Tis not Thy upper Paradise, that I Ambitious am to see, 'tis not Thy Court Of Angels, though by Phylax's Company, I guess their Worth; 'tis not the Pomp and Port That magnifies Thy Throne; nor do I long To dance to Thy sweet Quire's eternal Song. 340 To that soft Calm of never troubled Rest, Which smiles in none but th'empyræan Bay, My wishes are not bound: To be possest Of Glory's Realm, and sleep in beds of Joy; Are lofty things; but yet, alas, too low For me and my Desires to aim at now. 341 My bosom pants for Thee, and only Thee: And couldst Thou be in Hell, I never more Would loose a looking up to Heav'n, but be Inamored of that Abyss, and poure My longing Aspirations downward, till I at Thy feet my Vows and Soul could spill. 342 Why art Thou gone, and yet so strongly here! Why art Thou here, yet to such distance gone! Why dost Thou draw Thy ravish'd Worm so near, Yet banish her by Thy Ascension! Why must my Soul be kindled to a pitch Which she cannot permitted be to reach! 343 O why art Thou so infinitely sweet? Or rather, why must We that sweetness know If Thou dear Jesu, wilt not think it meet To these our Fires their Fuel to allow? Away Thou flyest, and forsaken We Tormented lie ev'n by Thy Suavity. 344 How shall I help this my excessive Passion, Or how can it this torture merit? since Thine own strange Love profest Immoderation, And guilty was of boundless influence: In which soft Sea of Fire whilst drown'd I am, What can I do but burn with answering flame? 345 Ah blame me not, great Lord; it is not I, But Thou Thy Self rebounding from my Heart, Who beat'st heav'n with this Importunity, And call'st for Ease for my mysterious Smart: Hadst Thou by Love not stamp'd Thy Self upon My Soul, Thy Worm had now let Thee alone. 346 Remember what deep Anguish 'tis to be Forsaken; O remember Thine own Cry, Which in Thy Desolation on the Tree Challeng'd Thy Sire's Retirement: May not I Resume Thy Plea? My God, My God, why now Hast Thou abandon'd Psyche left below? 347 Upon this Olivet my Calvary I find, and to my Cross am nailed here: Ten thousand pangs are revelling in me; And full as many Thorns as planted were Upon Thy Temples, in my Bosom stick, There all the bowels of my Soul they prick. 348 O Love! why must thine only Tyranny The bounds of other Cruelties exceed? Why will it not allow the Courtesy Of Death to thy poor Vassals who are dead By its reviving Slaughters, and desire Free Holocausts to be in thy sweet Fire? 349 Her Passion here above Expression towr'd, And left her flagging Tongue in Silence seal'd: Yet with resolved Eyes to Heav'n she soar'd, And by a long Oration there appeal'd; Both long, and fluent, in th'exuberance Of Tears, the streams of strongest Eloquence. 350 But Phylax having to her boiling Heart Thus far indulg'd, thought fit to cool it here: Psyche, said he, imagin not thou art Inamor'd deeper than His Scholars were Of their Ascended Lord: yet desolate they Warn'd by the Angels, meekly went away. 351 Do Thou like Warning now receive from Me: On heav'n why nailest Thou thine eyes in vain? Thy Savior's flown too high for them to see, Till on a Cloud He posteth back again; Then shalt thou look thy fill of Bliss, and be To all thy Love's Extremities let free. 352 Mean while thine Adorations and Embraces Thou on His Name and Memory may'st pour, Why should these bitterly-delightful Places Of Mercie's Triumphs longer rub the Soar Of thy soft heart? Here on Her hand he laid His own, and raised up the heavy Maid. 353 Then in his Chariot gently her he set, Who on the Footsteps kept her hankering eye. But instantly he mov'd his Reins, to let His sprightful Coursers know their liberty: Forthwith their Mains' luxuriant Volumes they Shook in proud haste, and galloped away. CANTO XVI. The Supply.

That Absent Love might here be Present still, He on His dear Disciples' Heads His own Coequal Spirit from heav'n's lofty Hill Pours in a Wind's loud-rushing Torrent down; And Pentecost in solemn State transfers From Jewish, to the Christian Calendars. 1 Ye gentle Souls, whose ravish'd bosoms are Tun'd to the sweet and lofty Key of Love; Whose flaming Thoughts can in the answering sphere Of pure and mystick Fire securely move; Whose stoutly-paradoxick Essence founds Its dearest Health upon its deepest wounds; 2 Ye whose brave Strength in Languishments can reign, Whose calmest Solace in Disquiet rests, Whose resolute Joy's inhanc'd by cruel Pain, Whose daintiest life by daily Deaths subsists; Ye who by Loss your secret Gains improve, And are not what you are, but what you love: 3 To You, most apprehensive you alone This Preface her abstruser self presents; For though the Stoicism of Ice and Stone Which stupifies ignoble Hearts, prevents Her entertainment there: yet you can well And truly understand the Truths you feel. 4 Those torturing Truths, which too-too Present are And Near, in Abscence and sad Separation: O cruel Names, which on a Lover's ear Beat more unsufferable Perturbation Than ever from the angriest Thunder's Roar Down on the soul of frighted Guilt could pour. 5 For what is Love, but that mysterious Glue Which joins—O no! which more can do than join: Which makes Two Hearts disdain themselves to view Longer as Two, and generously combine Into an Union so severely close That in the knot ev'n Self it self doth lose. 6 No such cold Things remain as I and Thou, No such loose-laced Words as Mine and Thine: Thou into I, I into Thou doth grow, Or rather Thou and I in I intwine. Both Here and There together strangely shut, I in this bosom, I the same in that. 7 Mine hates it self, until it self it feel Daintily nestling in Thine's dearer breast: And Thine is not at home till it can steal Its property into Mine's sweeter nest: Thus Mine and Thine into one Mine are run, Nor will Love know more Possessives than One. 8 Is 't for my Friend? it is not mine to give; O let him freely take what is his own: His wants must needs my Interess derive Unto himself: then let it be my Crown, My Fame, my Life; I cannot lose, nor miss What will be more mine own in being His. 9 Doth golden Plenty wait upon His Pleasures? I dare Misfortune's spight to make me Poor: For my Estate's ensured in his Treasures; Kept in his bank are my Accounts: the more I need, the more must He disburse, and be Malgre Disasters Envy, Me to Me. 10 Doth spightful Mirth smile in my pleased eyes? He by those Mirrours dresses his Delight. Do Sorrow's clouds in his horizon rise? The same envelope mine in doleful night. No different things are such to Us, but We As willingly in Griefs as Joys agree. 11 I by His Wisdom sage and learned am; He by my Beauty gracefully doth shine; He my Dishonor owns, and I His Fame; My Health is his, and his Diseases Mine: Abroad He always in my Journeys is, In his Retirement I my Home possess. 12 Mine are his Thoughts, and His are my desires: Alike our faithful Bosoms pant and heave; One equal Fervor all our Motions fires; Heart doth with Heart embraces interweave: What Words can ne'r express, emphatick Sighs Speak plain, and most intelligible Eyes. 13 We sigh for joy our happy selves to find More closly soder'd than our Tongues can tell: We glance our Rhetorick, and look our mind To one another; till the Spectacle So equally reflects us both, that He As I in Him, beholds himself in Me. 14 Yet though the Soul of Sweetness thrilling be In this dear Riddle; still it doth create New Thirst of more Content amidst this Sea Of Satisfaction; still our Bosoms beat In strong ambition to be nearer yet, Though they in straitest Union be knit. 15 In everlasting Discord they agree, Still fighting which should with the best Embrace Hug his most-nearly-precious Enemy, And higher strein what most excessive was: O noble Strife, whose venturous Ardors prove There's no end of Superlatives in Love! 16 Since then the Marriage of souls, which are Espous'd by true and genuine Affection, Reigns in Delight's supremest purest Sphere; What reach of fancy, or Poetick fiction Can with due horror paint that strange Vexation Which boils in Absence and in Separation. 17 Disrobe me of my Beauty, and unty My closest veins; undress me, of my skin; Unclasp my Joints; unlace my nerves; and try My finest tenderest membranes to unpin: Yet something still you leave me since I find My Heart at home, and in my Heart my Mind. 18 But if you snatch my friend, my friend away, Of all my dearest All you quite devest me; Upon my Heart, my mind; my Life, you prey: And in this loss what Comfort can assist me! My Soul you split, you cleave my Bowels, and My Sweetest Essence quite in sunder rend. 19 Mistake me not: though here I now appear, O I am nothing less than here; for I Intirely am confin'd and chained there Where e'r it be that My most Mine doth lie. Trust, trust sad Truth: 'tis but my shadow this; With Him, with precious Him my Substance is. 20 Feel not my Pulse, nor ask me How I do; Such Questions only mock my Loss and Me: Go where I am; to my Soul's Jewel go, Where your Demand can clearlyest answer'd be: By his Disease or Health you best shall tell Whether unhappy I be Sick or Well. 21 Nay lose no grave Discourses on my Pain, Which no Philosophy has wit to cure: Wisely you preach, but that you preach in vain; Nor can my wedded loyal Ear endure New Counsels to embrace, since He is gone, Whom I espous'd for Oracle alone. 22 Peace idle Musick; thy concording Strings With jarring discord grate my widdow'd Heart. No harmony, say I, whoever sings, Unless my dearest Solace bears his part. Airs are cold Wind, but where soul-charming He Inflames the Tune with cordial Suavity. 23 Remove that Banquet, whose choise Dainties be But bitter Memorandums of my Wo; Whilst every Viand feeds my Memory With thoughts of how much sweeter sweets I now Bereaved am, and left to famish here Far far from Him my heart's sustaining Cheer. 24 Walk if you will; I no Delights can gather In all that thickset Garden of Content: Those spicy Beds whose smiles invite you thither, Choke my Approach ev'n with their odorous sent: He He's my Paradise; whence being thrown, All Earth to me with Thorns is overgrown. 25 Y' are out again: nor will the Theatre Find me more Company than yon dark Grove: Though rivited in thickest Throngs I were, I still through woful Solitude should rove: Still I'm alone, yea singler than alone; In Absent Him I from my self am gone. 26 When Titan's wheels have roll'd him under Night, Her Widdowhood so sadly sits upon The loyal Marygold, that from the sight Of all the World she willing is to run: She shuts her curtains, down she hangs her head And leaves her self so long['s] her spouse is fled. 27 My friend's my Sun; and what's this World to me But Night and Blackness, seeing He is set? Wonder not then my hanging head to see, My senses' windows clos'd, my Spirit's put To bed; alas, but not to rest! and this My house of flesh and bone grown Tenantless. 28 Kind Brothers, gentle Sisters, O how fain My Arms would meet and hug your Courtesy! But strange Impossibility's great Chain Forbids me that Delight, since dearest He In whose embrace alone I sweetness taste Beyond my vainly-panting reach is plac'd. 29 Brothers and Sisters are no more to me Than empty Names and handsome Skins of Joy: Talk not of Blood; of all Affinity Love's is the nearest: and now He's away, All all my Kinred's lost, and you to me Are strangers by meer Consanguinity. 30 Tell me no more that my arrived Ships Have brought the East to make my Riches rise Fuller and fairer; for His Absence nips That springing Wealth; His West seals up mine eyes To eastern Joys, and no Returns can be Gainful, but that which brings Him back to me. 31 I grant my Crop is fair, and well content Is Ceres to lie crouded in my Barn: But ah, what pleasure can I thence resent Who famish'd am amidst my plenteous Corn! That swelling store but mocketh my Distress; My Barn is full, my Bosom empty is. 32 Do, if you please, think me and call me Mad; For I alas, find I am more than so: Madmen lose nothing but their wits; and had My Loss no further reach'd, my present wo Had not been infinite; but wretched I Of Head and Heart and all deprived lie. 33 Never was lunatick lymphatick Wight So cruelly Distracted, as poor I, Who thus am torn and flung far from the light Of mine own eyes; far from the Kiss of my Own lips; far far from Him who needs must be In spight of Distance Nearest still to me. 34 Discredit not the Strangeness of my Pain By bowing it to any Parallel; Nor let the rack'd dismembred Men complain That they on Earth are damn'd to such an Hell: There, only Composition's rent, but I This sad Division find in Unity. 35 I am not I; nor know I what I am: A monstrous Nothing for my self I find. O how comes Emptiness so full of flame, Which scorches and devours my absent mind! O Me, not Me! Why may my Pangs not end In mine own Inanition! O my friend! 36 This is the fury of the sober Lover Whene'r the fuel of his fire's away; In this impatient Phrensy he boils over The brim of whatsoe'r strives to allay His Desolation; nor dares he be Content, till his more precious Self he see. 37 Let not Amazement then on Psyche gaze; Her Passion's violence no more then suits With Love's Decorum: Love enacted has This brave Self-torture, whose excess confutes All Comforts in that Bosom, which is left Quite of her Soul's intirest Soul bereft. 38 For 'twas not after any Mortal friend That now her labouring heart did pant and reach: O no! her restless Aim was to ascend After Ascended Jesus; who with such Infinitude of Sweetness drew that she Could not in this contention finite be. 39 This swell'd the Billows of her sighs so high, That soon they overwhelmed Phylax's Haste; Drown'd all the Nighings of the Coursers by A louder Tempest; a new Bridle cast On their loose Reins: and by a mighty Shock Broke the Wheels' Speed, and blew the Chariot back. 40 For now the tender-hearted Angel grew So deep a sharer in the Virgin's Pain; That to aswage his own in hers, he flew To Salem's cordial Spectacle again; Steering his smoaking Steeds' cloud-cutting feet Into Content's dear Harbor, Olivet. 41 Psyche forthwith levell'd her hasty Eye Against the venerable footsteps, and Shot her heart thither fether'd with a sigh Of pious Joy: then darting out her hand And Head, her fervor hug'd and kissed what (Being distant still) she hug'd and kissed not. 42 When Philax thus: sweetly-afflicted Dear, Disparage not thy Lord's Magnificence By deeming that those empty footsteps there Are all the Tokens Love's triumphant Prince Did on the Spouse's loyal hearts bestow, Whom, though on earth, He would not leave below. 43 No: His most bounteous Wisdom found a way To make them be in Heav'n e'r they come thither, By not enduring that His Heav'n should stay For them above, but come aforehand hither: It came, and taught Beneath to be on High; It came, His Absence fully to SUPPLY. 44 Sit then soft Soul, sit down; for Rest may here Be reap'd, ev'n in this World of Restlesness. Sit down, and I to entertain thine ear Will such a feast of royal Comfort dress, As shall compel thy hungry heart to say All Dainties are not with thy Lord away. 45 Mark that bare head of yonder Mountain: 'twas Once cover'd with a House; until the Broom Of Vengeance swept away proud Salem's grace, And made for righteous Desolation room: That scene it was Jesus's bounty chose The Comedy of Comfort to expose. 46 For His Disciples, though no longer they Could hold Himself, yet kept they His Command; Not dreading in that Town to fix their stay Where thousand foes their Valour did attend. What Dangers could afflict their stay with fear, Who waited for the Promis'd Comforter. 47 And yet they challeng'd not the Wrath of Spight With broad defiance; but in sober Care Array'd their Resolution to fight If to the battle they inforc'd were. As valour's stain it is, and shame, to fly; So, needlesly to seek an Enemy. 48 Into that House they manag'd their Retreat, And gallantly their Hold they fortify'd With Unanimity: strong Guards they set Of Prayers and Watchings; and on every side Themselves secured with a moat of Brine Fed by no other Springs but their own Eyn. 49 Well-furnished they were with Ammunition, With shields of faith, with fiery darts of Love: Besides a plenteous Stock of sound Provision To dare all Perils' siege; for from above Being at first with Hope supplyed, they Fed on that hearty Diet Night and Day. 50 Hearty it was, and able to maintain The fortress of their Life and Health: but yet Their breeding Solace in its birth was slain, Because the Promise which had fir'd their great Zeal's Expectation, cold delays did make, And now the ninth Day held them on the rack. 51 Alas how shall their wearied Anchor bear The Tempest of the Tenth; which with more sadness Will on their Patience beat, because they are Summon'd by it to publick solemn Gladness: To pensive Them the joyous Pentecost Its own renown'd festivity hath lost. 52 O how the most unseasonable feast Insults and laugheth at their Desolation! For since the Bridegroom of their Souls, who blest The Palate of their hearts with Contentation, Away is flown; fast, fast they must, though they At Plenty's proudest board sit down to day. 53 And fast they will, now He would have them fast, Whose Pleasure feasts them when they most abstain: His Will their Banquet is; nor dares their Taste But please its loyal self in any Pain His wholsome Love provides; like bitter sauce The sweetness of His sweets the more to grace. 54 Resolved thus; with cheerful Sadness they Look'd up, and faced Pentecost's fair Dawn: When Jesus, weary of His own delay A brighter festival hastes to pour down; A festival which by the sacred power Of fuller sweets that other might devour. 55 The Angels started at the wondrous sight; All Heav'n was mov'd and quak'd with mighty joy; In sunder shivered with sacred fright The spheres laid open an Illustrious way, And fain through their own gap would have descended And on the progress of their King attended. 56 For leaping out of His eternal throne, Where He with equal Majesty did shine Together with the Father and the Son, Th'almighty Spirit bowed His divine Highness to this low journey; for He went Though sent by Them, yet, by His own Consent. 57 And that His Progress might embraved be By all the Port of bright Magnificence; Master of His own Ceremonies He Himself contriv'd the way how to advance His Coming down; since He descended now Not to Descend, but Rule and Reign below. 58 Through that soft Air which fills the boundless Sea Of highest Heav'n, though no rude Tempests roar, Yet dainty Gales of potent Suavity Their storms of everlasting Odours pour; Which Blisse's Calms more calm and gentle make, And in deep Joy the Souls of Angels wrack. 59 All these He summon'd to attend His Eye By an imperious Beck; and nimble They By Prest Obedience making their reply, Flew to His glorious foot, and panting lay In greedy expectation to know How by His service they might nobler grow: 60 When Sovereign He from their delicious Throng Cull'd all the choisest Breaths He saw excel In Pleasure's wealth, or Speed's impatient wing, Or Power's nerves: which as they 'gan to swell To goodly Multitudes, He into one Conspiracy of Closeness bad them run. 61 Forthwith their yielding Essences they clung Into such strait submission, that now They find their various selves quite lost among Themselves; nor can they any longer blow Their several ways, but fitted are to fly About no bus'ness but of Unity. 62 Which when their Lord observ'd, you now, said He, Shall learn, that 'tis not Height that maketh Heav'n; To My celestial Realm beneath, with Me You shall the honor have to stoop: for ev'n On lowest earth I mean My Throne to found, And spread My Empyreum on the Ground. 63 This said; full in the lap of that fair Wind He pitch'd Him down, and there His Chariot took: To which He meant no Coursers' help to bind, Which through the mighty Road away might smoke: A Coach of Wind no borrow'd Swiftness needs, Being it self its own most speedy Steeds. 64 But yet e'r this Almighty Traveller Set forth, much more of Heav'n He pleas'd to take: A glorious Altar its four horns doth rear Before th'eternal Throne, and holier make The sacred Hecatombs it beareth, by Its own inestimable Purity. 65 For all its radiant Metal temper'd was Of Claritude's own thrice-refined Soul: But since the poverty of Language has No richer Word, we are constrain'd to foul Its gallant Beauties, and its Splendors fold Up in the dim unworthy name of Gold. 66 Yet though the golden Pile with fairer beams Than horns did flame, the Coals enthron'd on it, Pour'd out a flood of more Illustrious streams, Dazeling the metal'd Eyes of their own Seat. Strong was the fire, yet amorously mild; Deeply it burnt, yet harmlesly it smil'd. 67 For with a Ray, shot from His quickning Eye, LOVE kindled it at first; and ever since It gratefully maintains the gallantry Of its most blessed birth: the Excellence Of sweetest Vigor in the Bonfire keeps Its court; in every Spark Life's fervor leaps. 68 Let any of these Coals bestow a kiss On mortal lips, the ardent Complement With Heav'nly Eloquence will stigmatize The blessed Mouth; nor shall the stout Consent Of Learning's opposition break the force Of that inflamed Tongue's sublime Discourse. 69 But if it burns its passage through the breast, The Heart with nature's pulse no longer beats; But with the fulness of new Life opprest, Lab'reth and panteth with immortal Heats; Yielding bright proofs, that Heav'n's high fire's no less Unquenchable than that of Hell's Abyss. 70 The Sovereign Spirit from this fair Altar's sphere Listing two Troops of choise serenest flames, Together coupled them all pair by pair; Then severing by a Cleft their upper beams, Their radiant roots into one stock he clung, And form'd each Two like One divided Tongue. 71 In splendid equipage He mustered All these before His sprightful Coach, that they Might graceful Tapers be to light and lead His great Procession's Pomp; which to the Ray Of far inferior Titan for a golden And flaming Convoy, scorn'd to be beholden. 72 Appointed thus, His royal March He 'gan, Needing no Trumpets' throats the News to tell; The gallant Pæans of His vocal Van To all the Orbs proclaim'd the Spectacle: Heav'n summon'd by the strong Alarm, awoke, And all its twinckling Eyes did thither look. 73 Into Amazement's Deep old Nature started, And there stood staring on the wonderous sight In which She read her own great Statutes thwarted By Him whose Mandate first had set them right; Seeing brisk Lightness its strange Progress rending Through weight's dull road, and wind and fire descending. 74 As in the speed of furious Sweetness this Greedy Procession down it self did croud; By sudden fragor's vast Impetuousness The Air's calm Ocean all was overflow'd: Which Noise's flood broke ope that House, and there Thy Lord's Disciples overwhelm'd with fear. 75 Not with that slavish fear which strikes the stroke Of Vengeance upon guilty Hearts before The whip can touch them; but with Dread whose Look Starts into joyouse Hope; a Dread which more Afflicts with piercing Comfort than with Pain; Which pinches, but by breaking of the Rein. 76 The blustering Language of the Coach they heard, And fully understood from whence it came; By which their Expectation's Bliss appear'd Before its Apparition: had no flame Lighted the noble Truth, yet plain the case They found, that Heav'n upon them rushing was. 77 But as their eyes they lifted up to meet Their glorious Hopes, th'authentick Attestation On their brave faith its radiant signet set: In broke the mighty Wind of Consolation, With all the Lightning's graceful Troop, and on Their Heads each flaming Tongue strait took its throne. 78 The blessed Breath its vigor roll'd about The wondering House, and every corner fill'd; Yet suffered no Blasts to straggle out, And blow on Jewish, or on Pagan field: Heav'n's Spirit hither deigned to resort, And only here He means to keep His Court. 79 What though its Walls be poor; what though the Room As yet be scant? the simple fabrick is His Holy Church, His sublunary Home, His sweet though but His earthly Paradise: Though other Piles be fair, God chooseth none To be His Temple, but His Church alone. 80 The fond Schismatick and Heretick fry Flatter their conventicling Cells in vain, As if the sneaking Arms of Privacy The great and Catholick Spirit could contain; Or He in snarling several Sects could dwell Who Union's is and Peace's closest Seal. 81 Indeed with Wind their Houses filled are; But empty Wind, or full of baneful breath; Breath much of kin to that contagious Air Whose bosom stuffed is with gales of Death: Breath of immortal Plagues, which pierceth through The breast and heart, till Souls to hell it blow. 82 Nay several Breaths together bluster there, And all the Card of Winds in battle meet: Whence by the Tempest of their monstrous War They upon Cities, Churches, Kingdoms beat, Till into mad Confusion's gulf at last Wrack'd friends and foes, and their own selves they cast. 83 O that the foolish World so far would learn Its own felicity as but to know The soil that bears it! could they once discern That in the Church's mount it groweth, how Could madness be so mad as once to think To find it in a conventicle's sink? 84 But to display the Plenitude with which The Spirit's vast Magnificence did store His dear Ecclesiastick House, the reach Of Seraph's largest Eloquence, nay more, The glorious Compass of the Tongues which thus Attended it, too scant and narrow is. 85 Yet noble were those Tongues: whose cloven fashion Their temples crown'd with due Significance, Who were by this sublime Inauguration Made sacred Princes of all Lands. Not chance, But just and Heav'nly Reason did bestow These flaming Miters on the Churche's brow. 86 Mitres, whose bright Prerogative as far Outshines old Aaron's golden Coronet, As purest Evangelick Glories are Above the sphere of Legal Beauties set: Most reverend Miters, which ingraved were With greater Holyness than triumph'd there. 87 This shape's fair Points right gloriously maintain Due opposition to Hell's ugly King: These Princes destin'd were above to reign, For ever, He beneath: and answering In head and feet their several Kingdoms, now They Cloven are above, and He below. 88 Nor must th'Ambition of the forked Hill Which higher than it self proud Greece doth lift, By Cirrha or by Nissa parallel The loftier Honor of this splended Cleft: Here here in multiplicity the true Parnassus his most learned Top doth shew. 89 Here dwels not that thin family of Nine Fictitious Sisters, whom kind Poets first Devoutly fixing in their fancie's shrine, With Praises and quaint Admirations nurst Into fond Deities; and then desir'd By what themselves had made, to be inspir'd. 90 O no! a Brood of Graces numberless And really divine, which hatched were By th'everlasting Dove's pure warmth, in this Illustrious habitation Tenants are: Graces with whose enthusiastick Heat Both breasts of Poets and of Preachers beat. 91 For these fire-crowned Saints conveened here Where Heav'n's grand Trumpets, chosen to proclaim Round Phebus's circle unto every ear The glories of a fairer Titan's Name: And now Heav'n's Breath was ready come to teach The World-alarming Trumpets, how to Preach. 92 And this unclouds thy doubting, Psyche, why On these Disciples' heads this Embleme sate: No Badge so truly proper to imply The signal Glory of their Charge, as that: Talk not of Beauty, Wealth or Pedegree; What but a Tongue the Preacher's Crown can be? 93 This with meet emphasis declares that they Are His Embassadors who is the Word: Their Errand's Peace; nor seek they to array Themselves in Steel, or trust to spear and sword; Compounded all of Sweetness is their might, As being sent to Treat, and not to Fight. 94 Religion knows no stern Artillery, But in her Tongue her gentle Powers reign; Prayers and Persuasions her Engins be, Prepared pure unbloody Bays to gain: Her Master's Death suffices her, and she No other Wounds desires to make or see. 95 Her own dear Veins She rather will expose To quench the barbarous Thirst of any steel, Than broach and quaff in others; with her foes More kindly She than with her self will deal, And struggles at her own Life's price to give Them happy power eternally to live. 96 Shame then, the dregs of shame all poured be On their bold Souls, who shall hereafter by The Ammunition of Barbarity Religion's peaceful Quarrel fortify; Who not by Prayers, but Armies shall beseech, Who not by Tongues, but Canons' Roar shall preach. 97 Whose Church shall grow so Militant indeed, That it by nothing but by War can stand; The flames of whose hell-kindled Zeal shall feed Upon and quite devour the Altar; and Its wild Combustion spread to Court and Bar, Till Throne and Laws in Ashes buried are. 98 'Tis true, these Tongues of Pentecosts were all Compos'd of fire, but fire serene and mild; Which corresponding to the festival, With harmless fervor on these Preachers smil'd: Bright were the flames, yet did not scorch but gild, Covering their Temples with a radiant Shield. 99 Resolv'd to sport it in a Summer's Eve Thus did of late the merry Lambent fire An innocent Kiss to thine own Tresses give; A Kiss which still thy ravish'd thoughts admire, Being so tender that it could not by Thy touch be felt, but only by thine Eye. 100 Yet though those flames on this Assembly sate With unconsuming delicacy; They Approv'd themselves victoriously hot, When through the World their might rent ope its way And burnt so bright from East to West, that it On a-light fire with Zeal all Nations set. 101 With sacred Zeal, which made all Dross its Prey, All Dross of Ignorance, of Superstition, Of atheous Grossness; and refin'd the Clay Of humane Nature into a condition So richly pure, that on its holy face Splendidly legible God's Image was. 102 Nor prov'd their Heat less useful than their Light, Which poured out meridian Grace's Day Upon the Depth of that Soul-blinding Night Of Sin in which all Countries groping lay: For Piety forthwith awoke, and read Heav'n clear and plain, and what way thither led. 103 Has holy Fame not acted to thine ear That old Exploit which graved Shinar's Plain On Memorie's eternal pillars? where The deep and dreadful Item stands, to rein All mortal Pride's bold speed, and fright Ambition Into remembrance of its frail Condition. 104 All several Tongues as yet were One, nor did Distinction of cross Dialects estrange This Colony from that; no Sense lay hid In an exotick Dress; no Climate's change Created need of an Interpreter To speak again what once was spoken there. 105 When humane Race, who freely now could trade With one another's Minds, together laid Their heads and plots, and politickly mad Consulted how to make their fears afraid, To fortify their Strength, to teach their Pride To rise, and Union not to divide. 106 The drowned World so deep had sunk into Their jealous hearts, that though the King of Fate Shot them Assurance from his splendid Bow, On their own Counsil's anvil still they beat, And hop'd to hammer by their Wisdom's work Some surer larger Refuge than an Ark. 107 For all in Parliament most gravely met, And having popular Nimrod chose to be Their learned Speaker; cunning he, to get By his sly Bait of outside Honesty. Power's prize his proud-hearted-burning thirst to slake, With looks demure the wild House thus bespake: 108 Henceforth all private Thoughts farewel, adieu Mine own Estate, my Fame, my Liberty; Nimrod must have no more to do with you Than with the Publick you the same can be: My Life's without me now, nor can I feel My proper Health but in the Common-weal. 109 How miserable were my Gains, could I Shift for my Self alone, when all my dear And rational Kinred must exposed lie To cruel Chance's insolent carreer? How could my Life its Name to me maintain Who must in every one of them be slain! 110 That therfore no Dispersion may unty Our Common Bodies' joints, and ope a way To Disolation's full-tide injury; I here propound, what I will first obey; Let it enacted be, that All combine Their Purses and their Hands in one Design. 111 In one Design, to build a City, where Against all fears we may our selves immure: And in that City's heart a Tower to rear Whose chance-defying Top shall not endure To be o'rlooked and controlled by Proud Clouds, or at the Thunder's mercy lie. 112 A Tower whose head amidst the Spheres shall dwell, And with a starry Crown imbellish'd be; A Tower which may befriend the Heav'ns as well As Earth, with bravely firm Security; And higher than Rain's empire, scorn the froth Of any Deluge's impatient Wrath. 113 Bold Nimrod so. The silly Senate all Voted his Motion strait into a Law, And then about their insolent Work they fall, And mounts of Slime and Brick together draw; Unto a barbarous depth they dig, and set In hell their heav'n-aspiring Fabrick's feet. 114 That Expedition then their Work might crown, They with their Morter mix'd their willing Sweat; The long-breath'd Sun was tir'd, and laid him down Before their daily Task would Rest admit; Nor could he out of bed so early be As they, who higher vow'd to climb than He. 115 O how much easier might they have ascended To heav'n's fair Hill, would they have gone the way Which Heav'n it self had oft to them commended! The possible and ready way, which lay Not o'r the dangerous tops of highlook'd Towers, But through Humility's safe shady bowers. 116 As now the monstrous Pile began to rise, One story climbing on another's back; The Workmen's swelling Joy first through their eyes, Then through their lips in haughty triumph brake: Loud were their Acclamations, and beat The Stars, which now their Tower presum'd to threat. 117 God heard the saucy Noise, and challeng'd by Its importunity, came down to see How far the Madness of Impiety, To her own ruin clambering would be: He came, and saw th'outrageous Work, and how Proud Dust above its Earth aspir'd to grow. 118 This made Him His just Indignation seal Sure on their Tongues which call'd His Vengeance down: The troubled Builders strait a-staring fell, Deeming all Ears were deaf except their own, Or that their Fellows' wits grew dizzy by Their rearing up this Edifice so high. 119 This man gives Brick, when that for Morter calls, This cries, a Hammer, that a Ladder brings; A-swearing this, and that a-Laughing falls To hear his Neighbours thus miscalling Things: This Prays, that Curses his Commanding; and This Rails, and that his Praises doth commend. 120 A hideous Combustion of Voice Amaz'd the Air; and each one wonder'd why He spake so loud, and yet could make no noise To any of the gaping Standers by; Whose Senses equally astonish'd were To find they heard not what they still did hear. 121 Confounded thus, away their Tools they threw, And all their Hopes which with their Tower had swell'd; Being inforc'd to study out a new Manner of Architecture, which might build More useful Castles in the Air than this, And raise of Words a various Edifice. 122 For in this clamorous hurliburly tost, They saw their Language which till now had run In one smooth chanel, miserably lost Into a maze of more than seven times ten Ragged Meanders, where the vexed Sound Alas, an harsh and troubled passage found. 123 This fatal Curse made every Country be Barbarian to one another, and To mighty cost put Humane Industry Their sillyest Neighbours how to understand: On sprucest Wit this stampt the name of fool, And sent profoundest Learning's self to School. 124 This forc'd through many tedious sweating Years The patience of the earnest Student; who Consumed with a thousand pallid Cares, Amidst his painful Work could nothing do. For to inrich his Tongue, his Brains he brake, And aged grew e'r he had learn'd to speak. 125 Strange scrambling Alphabets this multiply'd, And to an Art improv'd Necessity; Each parted Tongue this did again divide Into Eight several Stations, and by Unworthy Grammar's busy Niceties All generous Apprehensions exercise. 126 Yea Grammar too found all her Laws too weak To govern Language's extravagance; Such odd and unruly Idioms did kick Against her setled Discipline, and prance So wildly through Expression's fields, that Art Was fain to play the child, and conne by heart. 127 But Pentecost's miraculous Virtue now By cloven Tongues did Tongues' Division heal, And teach all different Languages to flow From single mouths; which happily repeal The fate of Bable, and can fully rear A loftier Tower then was designed there. 128 For these brave Architects impowred were The royal fabrick of the Church to raise: A fabrick which though its foundation here In low and scorn'd Humility it lays, It mounts above the Clouds in sacred pride And in the Heav'n of Heav'ns its head doth hide. 129 A fabrick whose Materials scatter'd lay Both in the East and West, the South and North; Which though no more than simple Dust and Clay, Yet far excell'd the Parian Marble's worth, And those fair Stones whose sparkling eyes with sweet And bright Good Morrows rising Titan meet. 130 These all both live and breath, and are endow'd With vigor which on Time's proud Sithe can tread: For in the bosom of this dusty cloud Are pure immortal Souls inveloped; Which, since the Church's Pile Spiritual is, Suit fairest with the glorious Edifice. 131 And O, what power of Art's requir'd to hew And square and polish Spirits! Psyche this High Workmanship's rare difficulties shew That more than Man the Master-builder is. He is indeed; and these Disciples now Felt with no less than God their bosoms glow. 132 Though flaming Tongues perch'd on their heads, yet in Their breasts the mighty fire its furnace chose: There, there th'eternal Spirit his divine All-quickning fervor's plenitude let loose; Which swell'd its Dwelling with impatient Bliss, And strain'd their heart-strings to Delight's excess. 133 As when the Harvest with a plenteous Crop Of smiling streams augments his teeming store, Jordan grown bigger than himself, flings ope The bounty of his Arms on either shore; And deluges of kind Embraces spreads Over the beauties of his neighbour Meads. 134 So in this time of Grace's Harvest now These sacred Souls were stuff'd and stretch'd so high That all their bosoms' banks proved much too low To bridle in their floods' immensity: The working Torrent broke their lips in sunder, And drown'd all Salem's ears in holy wonder. 135 (For sooner shall the fire refuse to burn, The golden Sun to chase out leaden Night, Earth's Lump to stand, Heav'n's nimble Wheels to turn, Th'inamor'd Needle to affect the sight Of her dear North; than all the World shall slake Their Tongues' carreer whom Heav'n inspires to speak.) 136 They Spake; but hampered and scanted now No longer in the Syrian Speeches' pale: All Sounds to them in champagne lay; and through That open Race they scoured, to forestal Bold Ignorance's Plea, and make't appear That All might learn, who would not stop their ear. 137 Nor were they common murmuring Rils which broke From their Lips' fount, but highest floods of Praise: Heav'n's mighty King they for their Subject took, And bravely ventured their first Essays On Love's Omnipotence, whose Wonders they In most courageous faith and Zeal display. 138 Forthwith a noble Auditory on These all-tongu'd Preachers thronged to attend; For from the rising to the setting Sun Devotion's bus'ness did to Salem send All pious hungry Hearts to feast it here, With sacred Pentecost's most solemn cheer. 139 Here Lybia with Cappadocia met; Ægypt and Media saw Pamphilia here; Here Parthia and Pontus crowded Creet; With Elamites here Jews surrounded were; Mesopotamia here kiss'd Phrygia, and Arabia here took Asia by the hand. 140 Had any been too great and proud to come, Imperial Rome on those high terms had stood; Yet she disdained not to travel from Her Pomp and mingle with this common flood: All which were welcom'd by a nobler feast Than by Mosaick Rites was ever drest. 141 A Feast so strangely sumptuous, that they Can nothing but their deep Amazement feed; The Elamite his wonder doth bewray Unto the Jew, the Lybian to the Mede. All loose themselves in dubious fancies, and Astonish'd are because they Understand. 142 The Babylonian Workmen wracked were In less devouring Deeps of Ecstasy Those unintelligible Sounds to hear Whose breath blew down their bold Conspiracy; Than these admiring Nations, now they know Plainly what spoken is, yet know not how. 143 Up fly their puzzell'd hands and eyes and voice, And thus they cry: What, O what do we hear! Did e'r from any single fountain choise Of every Liquor flow! what Root can bare All tribes and kinds of Herbs and flowers, and make, A goodly Garden grow on one poor Stalk! 144 Yet lo, those numerous Varieties Of disagreeing Languages, by which Each Country shut from one another lies Beyond Communication's friendly reach, All flourishing in reconcilement here Upon the tips of single Tongues appear. 145 And were not these strange Orators all bred In dull and simple Galilee? Yet we Find more then learned Athens' treasured In Ignorance's clownish Proginy; Which them both Linguists doth and Doctors make, For they as marvelously Teach as spake. 146 Home to our hearts they piercing come in our Own Dialects, and print their Sermons there, Leaving our most convinced Souls no power Of contradiction: O how Heav'nly-rare Is that Magnificence of Mercy they Like God's own Trumpets royally display! 147 What Miracles of News; what Oracles Of bliss-begetting Truths are these, by which We learn how bright Divinity a Dress Of Clouds put on; how God was pleas'd to pitch His Tent on Earth; and how Immensity Shrunk into Dust, and deign'd a Babe to be. 148 How mighty Jesus shin'd so fair, ev'n by His dim Condition, as away to chase Each misty Type and shady Prophesy Which muffled up till now Religion's face: How most oppressed He triumph'd, and though Both poor and scorn'd, Heav'n's Kingdom rais'd below. 149 What sacred Laws He for that Realm enacted; In what stupendous Deeds His Power did reign; How He His twice six Deputies elected; How He His Spirit promis'd to sustain Their faint frail flesh in that grand Office, and Their Patience arm'd that Promise to attend. 150 How by His dying Breath He blew down Death And undermin'd Corruption in His Grave; How Hell He lower trode, when's foot's brave Wrath Into the Dragon's brains due Vengeance drave; How He the third Day cancell'd mortal fate, And to the World op'd Resurrection's gate. 151 How gloriously besmear'd with Conquests, He Encoached in a thriambeutick Cloud Returned home; how Heav'n's sublimity In loyal reverence to His Coming bow'd; How He resum'd His Sovereign Throne, and there Honor's own earned Crown on's Temples ware. 152 The pious Strangers by these Admirations Eas'd their oppressed hearts. When Hell's black King Whose ever-jealous ear caught all Mutations Which through the coasts of startled Nature run, Rous'd his mad head, and shook the snaky hair And fiery horns which sadly stared there. 153 The fragor of the Heav'nly Wind he heard, Which rent his sturdy throne and stouter heart Into suspition that some stronger Lord Had seized on his Realm's superior part, And blown away his power to maintain His dearest Title of Air's Sovereign. 154 This fir'd his speed, and he to Salem flew To see what most he fear'd and hated most: Where those fair troops of flaming Tongues through new Terrors and Doubts his dazell'd fancy tost, And fry'd his brains in pangs, because they did Not burn but burnish this Assemblie's head. 155 Not all the seizings, shrieks, grones, yellings, which To damned ears his hideous Hell apply, Had ever jarr'd upon his Soul with such Sad harshness, as that blessed Melody Of all-agreeing Languages, which through Th'Apostles' Heav'n-tun'd lips distilled now. 156 Nor was the Theme of their most sweet Discourse Less bitter to his fell malicious Taste; For by divine Love's wonderworking force He into fetters felt his fury cast, And those Exploits he heard proclamed here The History of his own Ruins were. 157 But that which with more cruel anguish tore His venomous Soul, was to observe how all This Conflux in astonishment before This Miracle's bright face made haste to fall; Ne'r strugling by fond prejudice to slight What they could not resist by Reason's Might. 158 His breast he smote, he stamp'd, his lips he bit; Three desperate sighs he fetch'd; three times he try'd His tortured impatience forth to spit; But was as oft repulsed by the Tide Of gloriously-convincing power which he Saw shining in this sacred Prodigy. 159 Recoiling then into his belking heart Thus his indignant Fury there he chewed: Fy Belzebub; shall thine immortal Art Of Spight and Wrath so poorly be subdued, That silly Fishermen should catch thy Prey, And empty send thy Plots and Thee away! 160 Shall Galilean Tongues the credit wrest From thy renowned Oracles, and draw Astonish'd Nations to adore that Christ Who galls his Subjects with an iron Law; Whilst fooled Thou ingrateful Man to please Lin'st thy Commands with silken downy Ease? 161 What boots it Thee Damnation's King to be, If thy vast Realms depopulated lie; If thy presumed Slaves revolt from Thee And to thy hated Rival's standard fly; If Emptiness must fill thy Jails of Pain; If all thy sulphury Gulfs must flame in vain! 162 Canst thou with patience be a Devil, and yet Behold how in this new converted Rout, (Who for his Churche's Pile, themselves as fit Materials, to the Carpenter have brought,) Thy heedless Earth is tainted by the strong Christ-bred Contagion, swelling every Tongue! 163 Thus murmuring in his fretful self; at length His Wrath and Craft trode down his fear; and He Vowed to tenter Desperation's strength, And deepest Hell's profounder Policy, Rather than any of those Tongues should grow Famous by preaching his Pride's Overthrow. 164 Wind is but Wind, though puff'd from Heav'n, said He, And what care I for what was with it blown? Great Satan's Tongue is full as fiery As those which now these Galileans crown: Yea and from Heav'n it fell as well as They, Why then, why should it fear what those can Say? 165 'Tis true, their Might is mightier than their own; For Heav'n's grand Spirit nestles in their breast; (Though with more credit, sure, He might have shown Himself abroad, and chose fair Honor's List.) But am not I, brave I, a Spirit too? Yes; and will make my Rival find it so. 166 And since in ambush He His strength hath laid, (Whether in fear to pitch a field, or no, Let others judge:) it never shall be said But I at His own play will meet my Fo. I'd rather win by open battel; yet Rather than loose, I'l fight by secret Wit. 167 He to His cost shall quickly find, that I Can my Disciples too inspire; nor shall His Tongue's admired Multiplicity Outpreach my Orators. Shall Words appall Me, who ne'r stoop'd to Deeds? forbid it my Immortally-rebellious Gallantry. 168 Well beat my Pulse; well belk'd my noble Brain; Brave Triumph's March in my own heart I feel: My Plot's as sure and safe, as my Disdain And Wrath are just: all foolish Doubts farewel. Thus having brag'd his Blasphemies, the Feind With hideous gladness smiled in his mind. 169 Then having spy'd out an unhappy Knot Of unbelieving Souls, who stared there And scratch'd their musing heads; himself he shot Deep into their unguarded bosoms, where He tainted to such rampant strength their Doubt That from their lips the raging Venom wrought. 170 O fond Mistake! cry'd they: where are your eyes, Your Reason's eyes, ye blind Admirers! Why Must all the world by your rash Ecstasies Run headlong into credulous Foolery? Shall every Country else besotted be By,—which of all's the sillyest,—Galilee? 171 Is't such a tame and sober Age, that you A pack of Drunkards never saw but here! Alas poor Fishers; they have only now Taken too great a Draught: their Brains which were With Water more than Wine acquainted, feel What 'tis with new strange Elements to deal. 172 Perhaps 'twas Pentecost's Festivity Which tempted them into this jovial Fit: But they began the Feast too soon; or by Rude headlong Joy outran their Wits, and it. By this, had they a Temple there, you see What goodly Feasts they'd keep in Galilee. 173 The Wine was new, and news, and woo'd their Taste With such strong complement, that yielding They The pleasant smiling sparkling Nymph embrac't With wanton greediness; and threw away The tedious thoughts of their old Nets and Pains When once imprison'd in her dainty chains. 174 What cause of Marvel is it then, that they Who thus were stuff'd and stretch'd, at length run over; That working Must would not the bung obey, But on the Vessel's brim its strength discover! That brim's their lips, on which the surplusage Of their mad fulness foams its drunken rage. 175 What wonder e'r fool'd sober hearts, to see The Menades rapt into Ecstasies When ravish'd by their raging Deity They lost their virgin sense? And do not these Intoxicated Priests of Wildernes now With Bacchus's vitious virtue overflow? 176 What though their Legs no staggering betray? This drunken Fit works only upwards; and What gross and fuming burdens oversway Their Brains, you by their mouths may understand: For their unweildy Tongues reel to and fro, And stumbling through a thousand Dialects go. 177 Or if Wine's Spirit too unlearned seem To prompt so many Languages; why may That other Spirit not have tutor'd them Who taught their Master strength! 'tis less to Say Than Do: If He by Belzebub could break Hell's Laws, against them why may These not Speak? 178 Old Satan's cunning and hath often found The way his great Creator's steps to trace; A gainful Trick, and which hath fairly crown'd His hellish Projects with an heavenly Grace. If God once preach'd by Balaam's Ass, why may Not Satan do as much by These to-day? 179 But clearly to uncloud your Stupor, let A little Sleep but cool these Linguists' brain; And they from their evaporated Wit Will wake into their silly selves again: These Fishers then will all as silent be As their mute Preys they hunted in the Sea. 180 Thus rail'd this slanderous Crew: and Satan, who Had roared through their throats this Calumny, Presum'd to hope the Miracle was so Smitten and blasted, that it needs must die. Fond Devil! who though beat from heav'n to hell, Will still conceit he with his God can deal. 181 As when bold Malice contumely spits Upon th'Embassage of some glorious Prince, The generous Embassador forgets His own, and putteth on his Sovereign's sense; Whom stoutly he asserts, and from the face Of his great Interess wipes all Disgrace: 182 So Heav'n's twelve Legers now affronted by This foul Reproach which on their God did bound; Pluck'd up their loyal Zeal, and lifting high Their most undaunted heads, dispensed round About their railing Foes an awful Look, Which to their Lye, resolv'd Defiance spoke. 183 Their Captain then, He whose faint Tongue of late Into Apostasie's base safety sneaked; That cowardly Retreat to expiate, The powers of faithful Bravery awaked, And full in Slander's face led up the Van Of strong though naked Truth; and thus began: 184 O most mistaken Jews, lend me your ears, And fill'd with Bliss I 'l pay them back again: Wer't Wine's wild Energy which domineers In our O how unjustly slander'd brain; Yet would it quit your cost to hear us speak Since Verity from Wine's free lips doth break. 185 But ask your eyes, and they will tell you Day Is young and has but crawl'd three steps as yet: And can Suspition dream We would betray Our early hours to Night's foul bus'ness? let All Histories of Monsters ransack'd be, No morning Drunkards you inroll'd shall see. 186 Yet if you wash from Drunkenness's Name The guilty blot of carnal Luxury; We own the Word, and fear not any shame That can attend on such Ebriety, That Drunk we are, we willingly profess, But not, as you suppose, by Wine's excess. 187 'Tis not the blood of Grapes which swells our veins And makes our tongues so glib: O no, the Wine Whose sprightful vigor in our bosoms reigns, The gallant issue is of th'heav'nly Vine; Whence pressed but this Morning, down upon Our heads and hearts in living streams it ran. 188 Long since, your reverend Joel's piercing eye Discover'd this intoxicating Day; When drunk with sympathetick ecstasy This sacred Rage of ours he did display. O blame not then our Tongues nor Brains, since We Are thus distemper'd ev'n by Prophesy. 189 He, noble He, foretold, how in the dry Old age of Time, his God abroach would set Th'alquickning Fountain of Immensity To cure the languishing World's Drought, and let The Deluge of his mighty Spirit flow Down on parch'd gasping bosoms here below: 190 How this most cleansing Flood should wash the eye Of every Age and Sex so bright, that they Through gloomy Closets of futurity Should light themselves by their own searching Ray; And traffick in the deepest Mysteries Of holy Visions, Dreams, and Prophesies. 191 This, this, that strange Effusion is which now Our blind illiterate Ignorance hath drown'd; This from our heav'n-instructed tongues doth flow In every Dialect's right-tuned Sound. Our Souls this Wine enflames; and thus are We Drunk with mysterious Sobriety. 192 When Slander at this high Apology Chain'd in inevitable Muteness stood: Further to reach his blessed Victory, The conquering Saint on in's Oration rode, And on his now ingaged Auditory Full volleys poured of his Master's Story. 193 Which Charge so smartly wounded them, that they Fling up their Arms, and Quarter, Quarter cry; No longer they dispute, but meekly pray For life and pardon: nor could all the sly Recruits which Satan stole into their breast, The sense of this their Overthrow resist. 194 Three thousand Souls thus at one single Cast This lately-vilified Fisher caught; Whom from their Unbelief's rough Deep, to most Serene and happy Baptism's streams he brought; And sent back frighted Belzebub to quake Ev'n in the bottom of his burning Lake. 195 This early Conquest's grand Experiment Doubled their Privilege's former sense On these Disciples' hearts: the full extent Of that dear Promise their ascending Prince Pawn'd to their Widdowhood, perform'd they see: Now they invested are in Potency. 196 In Potency; and in such pure Delight That Joy's own Soul's not more content than they: Indeed all Pleasures seem'd to take their flight On Jesus's wings, when hence He towr'd away. But now in their own ravish'd breasts they find Heav'n's and Earth's Comforter Himself inshrin'd. 197 Whole Oceans of Jubilations beat And foam'd upon their bosoms' swelled shore: Their former selves they sought amongst those sweet Extremities, but found themselves no more: The Men were lost in joyous Perturbation, And all their Essence turn'd to Exultation. 198 This Solace's divine Contagion spread Upon all Contraries its conquering might; With Honor, this disgrace imbellished; This candied bitterest Tortures with Delight; This sow'd the Smiles of Life and pleasant Grace Thick in the furrows of Death's frowning face. 199 Nor could all Persecution's Troops forbid These Heros' March, whose valiant Jollity Through all Distress, and Straits and Anguish rid; Which muster'd stood to stop their Victory. Their Heav'n they sweetly antidated here, Whilst from their eyes was wiped every Tear. 200 Great was this glorious Bliss. But, Psyche, know A royaler Prerogative than this On their selected Souls was sealed now: As wide's Heav'n's Kingdom their Dominion is; Both East and West's their Jurisdiction, and They sacred Princes are in every Land. 201 On twelve fair Thrones they sit in heav'nly state, Judging the Tribes not of that Israel which Is scanted in poor Canaan, but that Whose equal bounds the World's wide margin reach; Spiritual Israel, link'd to Abraham by The surest bands of Faith's Affinity. 202 So absolute's their Legislative Right, That what they once establish for a Law, Not all the Votes of Hell, not all the Might Of contradicting Earth can overthrow: For in this style run their great Statutes, Thus It seems good to the Holy Ghost and Us. 203 And little thinks Heretick madness, she At God Himself lifts up her desperate heels, Whene'r her proud Opiniastrete Against Ecclesiastick Sanctions swells: For this almighty Spirit came not now To visit, but inhabit here below. 204 T'inhabit here, as long as Here is here, Till Dissolution's gulf this World devours: Although this royal Twelve have chang'd their sphere, And in a higher heav'n are fix'd than yours; Amongst their Successors He still abides, And always at their Council-Board Presides. 205 But as these Wonders with ecstatick joy Embrav'd and feasted these Disciples' hearts; Behold another Miracle's bright Ray Fresh Delicacies of Amazement darts: Their heads' dim region they enlightned find No less than was th'horizon of their mind. 206 For their faint Memories' low-seated Cells, Which fogs and mists had dammed up before, This searching Spirit with pure Brightness fills; And rouses their Astonishment the more To see how in their Brains' unlikely West That Claritude vouchsaf'd to choose its East. 207 Hast thou not seen, when courteous Titan's beams Pour his bright bounty through the Summer air, How in the golden bosom of his streams Thick shoals of Atoms swim? About this fair Irradiation's Scene thus scudding here Millions of Memorative Figures were. 208 And those not thin and starv'd, not blind, or lame; Not crude and embryo Notions; no shreds Of half-lost Things; no open-eyed Dream; No slow-pac'd Topicks, whose dull tedium leads Poor Recollection long long ways about, And often seeks what needed not be sought: 209 But fair and full Ideas; which were all Muster'd in Method's rational array; Off'ring their ripe and perfect selves to fall Into the gatherer's eye without delay; And telling brisk Anamnesis that she And all her pains henceforth might spared be. 210 Drawn up in fairly-ranged Bodies here Appear'd those mighty Precepts which of late Preach'd in the Mountain's awful Pulpit were When Truth's and Power's grand Prince the Doctor sate. Precepts which far outshined those which broke From thundering Sina's head in fire and smoke. 211 Here in their several Troops and Squadrons all Those Sayings and Expressions marshall'd were, Which from His venerable Lips did fall, Whether He taught, or prais'd or chode, or tare Out Devils and Diseases, or with smart Threatnings, alarm'd the dull obdurate Heart. 212 Here in a sweet Reserve all smiling stood His Promises and Benedictions: from His Baptism's streams down to His own Side's flood Whate'r He spake, found here its proper room: So did His new-rais'd Tongue's Discourse, which now Reviv'd again and march'd in open view. 213 The smallest Syllable, and lesser Point Fail'd not their due appearence here to make: The massy bulk of heav'n and earth shall faint And fade to nothing; but no Words that break From His dear mouth who is th'almighty Word In black Oblivion's pit can lie interr'd. 214 Thus, thus the Gospel first was writ, and in Thus many Copies: which soon after by The same great Spirit's providential Pen Transcrib'd in quadruple Epitomy, Sure to perpetual Memory treasur'd are In Piety's authentick Register. 215 Wonder not then, that no Conspiracy Of Earth's bold envy, or Hell's madder spight Could blast the growth of Christianity; Which flourish'd by no mortal Vigour's might, But by th'eternal Spirit, who power can give (And who alone,) to Life it self to live. 216 He potent He's her Soul, and fortifies Her heart's inexpugnable garrison: Whence He to every Part sends due supplies Of vivid heat and chearful Motion: No Members so remote, but still He warms And hugs them in His Influence's arms. 217 He warms and hugs them, if they kick and fight Not with His Favour's patience; nor by Sin's black cold puddle strive to quench the bright Flames of His Grace's Importunity: If by rebellious spight they grieve not Him Whose sweetness works to solace worthless Them. 218 Retort thine eyes into thy Self, my Dear, (For thou a Member of this Body art,) And mark by strict examination there How matters tuned are in thine own heart: Thy heart, I know, will answer, that it beats Less by its own than by this Spirit's heats. 219 Those Heats of His are they to which thou owest The speed of this thy sacred Pilgrimage, Far more than to these fiery Steeds: nor knowest Thou how to travel to the final Stage Of thy celestial Hopes, unless the blast Of this great Spirit help thy zealous haste. 220 Forget not then how happy is the debt Which thy best Thanks to Pentecost ingages: The royal Feast is not expired yet, Nor has long Time cool'd its heav'n-kindled Rages, Which here will surely flame till all this All By fatal fire into its ashes fall. 221 The Angel ceased here, in hopes that he Had quenched now his Pupil's sacred thirst: When with exultant tears bedewed, She Into her wonted Zeal's impatience burst, Crying, O Love, how how shall finite I Contain thy ravishing Immensity! 222 Was 't not enough that thy Magnificence Sent Phylax down from heav'n to Comfort me; But thou must pour a greater Spirit thence Than any of the winged Hierarchy; That Spirit which enlivens heav'n with bliss, And all our guardian Angels Phylax is! 223 Was't not enough, O matchless Sovereign Of most inestimable Bounty, that Thou climb'st Thy Cross in valiant disdain Of Shame and Torment, and refusedst not To give Thine utmost Blood for me, but Thou Must thus Thy mighty Spirit too bestow! 224 Do, sweetest Conqueror, if Thou canst, do more To triumph over Thy thrice-vanquish'd Slave: Lo here most potent Thee I challenge, for I fear no heavier Chains than these I have: Under Thy Love's whole Tyranny I groan, Nor could Omnipotence do more than's done. 225 Yet shall not this profoundest Project prove Sufficient thy poor Vassal to deceive; Nor must the greatest Tokens of thy Love Seduce my Loyal Languishment to leave Thirsting and panting after precious Thee, And drink full Solace from their Suavity. 226 How cowardly is his Affection's Heat Which can by any Present from his Friend Be tam'd and pacify'd, and fail to beat With ferventer Desire! Let Jesus send Me what He will, or can, His Gift shall but Whet and enrage my soul Himself to get. 227 Because this Paraclete the Fountain is Of sacred Comfort, therefore dare not I Pitch my Contentment's final rest in His Divinely-satisfying Company: He but augments my Debt, dear Lord, to Thee, And makes my love's impatience fiercer be. 228 Poor Psyche's heart why draw'st Thou by so great And irresistible a Cord as He. Yet strangely still averse, wilt not permit This violence to hale me home to Thee? Why must the Giver of mysterious Ease The Comforter Himself my pains increase? 229 Not for the price of thousand heav'ns would I A stranger to His blessed Influence be: Yet in Desire's deep furnace this doth fry My soul together, Him and Thee to see. Art Thou not one with Him? this then I crave, That Thee I may not want whilst Him I have. 230 O pardon my Unsatiableness, Since Thou thy self alone art cause of it: Though Pentecost's vast Plentitude should press Its feast of Joyes into my bosom, yet I should but famish'd be the more until I my Desires might at thy fountain fill. 231 As long's this cruel Distance puts a bar 'Twixt Psyche and her Jesus, woful she Is torn and sever'd from her self as far As groveling Earth from Heav'n's sublimity. O most prodigious Rack, which thus canst spare My life, and yet my heart in sunder tear! 232 Might I but die, how would I thank my pain! But I am that strangely-massacred She, Who sport for Death to make, must still be slain, Yet still survive, destroy'd afresh to be. Help, help, dear Phylax, for my Lord is deaf; Unriddle thou my Smart by some Relief. 233 Thus groaned she. But her wise Guardian now Seeing her Passion's Cunning drew Dismay From Comfort's purest Spring, forbore to throw Forestalled Counsil in her headlong way. 'Twas now too late to stop the Torrent's rage, Which yet Diversion might perhaps aswage. 234 He therefore to her ear made no reply, But seal'd his silent Answer on her lip: Which Kiss she welcom'd with a loving sigh, And hopes of something more in it did sip. But soon she saw that what her Expectation Took for the Preface, prov'd the whole Oration. 235 For nimble He strait by his shaked Rein Unto his Coursers signifies his mind; And they, whose fierceness all this while in pain Had stood and stamp'd, now snuff'd the scorned Wind; Louder and swifter than whose stoutest wing, In neighing triumph through the clouds they fling. CANTO XVII. The Cheat. The ARGUMENT. Leaving his Psyche, careful Phylax arms With wholesome sage Advice her tender breast; Yet by the Venom of Heretick Charms Demurely baited, down She sits a guest At Error's board; and by the treacherous Cheer It quite devoured, which She swallow'd there. 1 Thus snatched from her Paradise, where She No interdicted Fruit as yet had tasted; Poor Psyche groans, and counts her self to be Exil'd to woful Thorns and Bryars: blasted Were her late florid Joys, which knew not how On any ground but Palestine to grow. 2 And sits the Holy Land so high and dear In pious Souls' esteem? What Tongue can then Thunder sufficient Vengeance out, to tear Th'ignoble Sloth of those unmanly Men With equal indignation, who have let Vile Pagan Powers from Christians ravish it. 3 O who can patient be to see the grand Memorials of th'adored Incarnation Basely inslav'd to barbarous Rudeness, and Faith's Soil become an Infidel Plantation: Whilst Palestine is now no longer known By our Redeemer's Footsteps, or our own! 4 Could this prodigious Shame digested be By Roman Hearts, when on their Empire's throne No other Prince was culminant but He Whom all the best of Bayes attended on; Who like a Bank against the Torrent stood And turn'd the Gyant into Sarus's flood: 5 Whose mighty Hand sent bold Razates down To his eternal Night: who from the brow Of stern Cosrhoes shaked off his Crown; Before Syrhoes cancell'd nature's Law, Improving Vengeance, that the Tyrant by A Parricide dispatch'd, might double die: 6 Who wip'd the Roman Ignominy out, When he three hundred Eagles, which had long Been mew'd in Persian cages, nobly brought In triumph back, and bad them fly among Their fellow Ensigns, and as freely gaze As any of the brood, on Phebus's face: 7 Who not these Banners only did redeem, But ev'n Redemption's royal Standard too; Which he could then so preciously esteem That he himself its Porter turn'd, and so Made all his Empire stoop to that which He Upon His shoulders bore to Calvary. 8 Alas Heraclius, how has Heresy Atchieved what all Persia could not do! How has it made thine Eagles' pinions be Only of use to flie before thy Fo! Whilst one of Christ's great Wills thou tak'st away, In vain thine own thou hopest to injoy. 9 Lo how the Monster Mahomet's black Fry Like numerous Locusts from the pit of Night Crawle into Palestine, and there defy The blasted Powers of this Monothelite: Lo, they are to the holy City come, And Haumar robs him of his Savior's Tomb. 10 This rais'd in reverend Sophronius's breast A mighty Storm of Agonies, to see His venerable Salem's walls possest By Saracenical Impiety; And James his sacred Seat become the throne For curs'd Apostasy to reign upon. 11 He sigh'd and weep'd, and finding no Relief From Heav'n or Earth to slake his Lamentation, Resign'd himself to his victorious Grief, And drown'd in his own Tears, fulfill'd his Passion: For why should I live longer here, said he, Still to be slain by what mine eyes must see! 12 And now the Land of Milk and Honey lay For more than four long Ages overflown With Mahumetick Poison: till a Ray Of vigorous Christian Gallantry shot down From heav'n, and by the Ermite Peter's breath Blown to a Bonfire, flam'd with holy Wrath. 13 With holy Wrath it flam'd in many a Breast, But most in brave Bolonian Godfrey's, who In steel, and stronger Resolution, drest, Burnt with desire to meet his Pagan Fo: His Lorain can no longer hold him, He Has vow'd another kind of Duke to be. 14 His consecrated Legions he leads; And in their eyes their Quarrel to display, Fair in his goodly streaming Standard spreads The bloody Cross: whose dreadful beauty They Beheld with reverend Joy, and cryed, We Though in thy tincture, ne'r will shrink from Thee. 15 The Turkish Moon grew paler than before, And in a cowardly eclipse drew back, When this bright Banner Terrors 'gan to pour Upon her dazel'd face, and passage make To Victory, who always waited there, And never fail'd to bring up Godfrey's Rear. 16 To Christ's soft yoke from Turkish galling Lore Thus lesser Asia was reduc'd; and now The only Cries of Salem's Woes implore Great Godfry's Sword Fame's final crop to mow: Nor must those other Jebuseans hope This David's conquest by their Fort to stop. 17 Brave Indignation Him forbad to see That Theatre in barbarous bondage, where The World's Redemption acted was: for He Soon rescu'd it, and taught the Pagans there What Occidental Arms could do, whose eyes Beheld their own East set, his West arise. 18 Right Christian Hero, O how due to Thee Was sacred Salem's Crown, and more than this? How justly wears thy pious Victory Both Martial and Poetick Laurels' dress; Whilst thy illustrious Name and Glory reigns Both in the World's Applause, and Tasso's Streins! 19 Those Streins in which thy heightned Valour takes Not Salem only, but Eternity; In which with louder life thy Trumpet speaks, Because blown by a Muse whose Blast can fly Beyond Judea's bounds, and nobly dares Alarm the Admiration of all ears. 20 But when by Death Heav'n sent for Godfrey home; Baldwin, his brother both in Piety, And Blood, and Might, supply'd his royal Room. Sidon and Ptolemais felt what He Could in Religion's heav'nly Quarrel do, And so did Egypt's sturdy Caliph too. 21 He to his cousin Baldwin left his Crown, And his entailed Gallantry with it: Witness the routed Turks, and Antioch thrown In flat submission at his conquering feet. What though to Persia some renown he lost; His gains upon Damascus bare that cost. 22 Then Turine Fulco to this Scepter rose, But by's unhappy Fall drop'd it upon His unripe Son, his Baldwin; over whose Surprised Powers stern Noradine began Proudly to triumph, but was soon compel'd His stollen Laurel back again to yield. 23 Brother, and heir both of his Throne and Praise Was Almerick, a Prince of active Might; Whose sword grew fertile in triumphant Bays, And glittered with Glorie's awful light. All Ascalon beheld its noble flame When he from conquer'd Alexandria came. 24 Baldwin, his worthy Son, succeeded, and A long tough war with Saladine maintain'd; Till Leprosy subdu'd his martial Hand, And what force vainly tugg'd for, Weakness gain'd. Then chose he for his trusty Deputy Since Fate would have him choose, Joppean Guy. 25 Next him, his nephew Baldwin climb'd the throne, But quickly tumbled from his royal sphere; For undermining Guy's ambition Had vowed no Superior to bear: Which stung the Earl of Tripoly so deep, That he in desperate Plots his Wrath did steep. 26 With Saladine he deals, and wins so far On his proud hopes, that he persuades him to Conjure against the Christians in a War Which soon atchiev'd their total Overthrow. Just Heav'n this 'Taliation did decree, That Treason Treason's deadly Scourge should be. 27 In Piety's Metropolis anew Thus Barbarism came to domineer: Which rous'd the Western Emperor, and drew Devoted Legions to attend his War. Surprised Syria at his presence quak'd; 'Twixt fears and hopes the startled Turks were rack'd. 28 But as this generous Frederick in his Might Rode fairly on, his Courser's fatal Fall Flung down his Lord into the sudden night Of Death. When lo his noble Son, by all The Army chosen General, persued His Father's steps, and where he went, subdued. 29 But what can Virtue do, when Fates oppose! Against this hopeful Son of Valour, who Had taught the stoutest of his Pagan Foes How hopelesly they Him assailed, lo The Plague took arms, and in his warlike heart Fixt her unseen and most untimely dart. 30 French Philip then, and English Richard came, And with new Western Bravery made good That mighty Loss: the Lightning of their fame Flashed before their Swords; for like a Flood Incourag'd by two Torrents meeting, They Swallow'd up their Resisters, and their Way. 31 But Discord, that avow'd eternal Fo Of high Designs, turn'd Philip back again; Yet Richard still for Salem means; where though He had with Cyprus bought his right to reign; Home was he summon'd from his foreign Wars Timely to still his Albion's loud Jars. 32 To Salem then new Western Heros sped, By Saladine's decease invited thither. Fair smiling Hopes their Landing flattered, But strait their Sunshine turn'd to lowry weather: For lo, the Austrian Duke, and Saxon, by Their own deaths caus'd their Partie's hopes to die. 33 And yet undaunted Montfort with his brave Selected French, disdained back to start; Till he good reason to the Panims gave To grow so tame and kind as to impart Peace to the Christians, granting their desire Of freely holding Ptolemais and Tyre. 34 Mean while a glorious Conspiracy Of new-fir'd Princes to their Standards stream: Henry, Count of Saint Paul: of Campany Theobald; of Flanders Baldwin; and of Breme, Gualter: of Lovane, Henry; Boniface Of Monferrat: all cloth'd in steel and brass. 35 And these their march strait toward Salem bent, Till, by the Grecian Quarrels turn'd aside On Ducas they their holy Zeal mis-spent; And finding then fit fuel for their Pride, Forgot the Butt of their devout Design, And took no longer aim at Palestine. 36 The mighty Plunder of the Eastern Throne Takes up their care to try who most could snatch: Of Islands some, some the Dominion Of Cities, Provinces, or Countries catch: Yet Fortune's and the Armie's love bestow The vanquish'd Empire's crown on Baldwin's brow. 37 But Montfort's Truce expir'd: Germany Conjur'd again into the Holy War, Of which stout Brennus had the conduct: He, Whose Coming through the Pagans shot such fear, That they to buy it off agreed to yield Up whatsoe'r in Palestine they held. 38 But vain Ambition lost this offer'd Prize, Whilst sudden Hope of conquering Egypt throws So thick a mist before the Christians' eyes, That unto Cair the blinded Army goes; Where they with Nilus's Floods besieged round, Their sacred Enterprize untimely drown'd. 39 Yet Frederick his German Eagles spread, With which again he into Syria flew. The royal Birds no sooner fluttered About the Sultan, but his Trust they slew: He hast's to yield, and totally resign Unto the Christians their dear Palestine. 40 Thus when to his Imperial Diadem This conquering Prince had wedded Salem's Crown; He Raynold honors with his Vice-roy's Name, And brings his Triumph home. But soon the frown Of Fortune, or of Fate, blasted what He Had nobly brought to such maturity. 41 For when the heav'ns had roll'd five years about, Lo Raynold dies, and Salem's Bliss with Him; The Templer's Insolence such Falsehood wrought As Christians' Faith doth worst of all beseem: Their Breach of truce their punish'd selves deceives, And Salem unto Egypt's Sultan gives. 42 Yet holy Lewis with his Frenchmen strook New fright into the Panims' souls; for they At his illustrious Oriflambe's look Unto his Victories gave ample way; Offring him Salem, Palestine, and more Than Christians own'd in Syria long before. 43 But fatal Counsel (and which ill became Th'ecclesiastick Oracle to give) Inveigled him against the glorious stream Of his own willing Happiness to strive: And thus refusing what he came to gain, Himself he lost, and only found a Chain. 44 For overborn by Egypt's armed Tide He to the Sultan prov'd a captive Prey. Yea when set free again in vain he try'd His new Adventure's strength; for by the way Both on his Army, and Himself, a dire Contagion empty'd out its deadly ire. 45 His Quarrel Edward, England's sprightful Prince Took up and lost none of the English fame: What Palms had this stout Hero pluck'd from thence, Had his confederate Princes timely came! But whilst unworthily they lingred, He Return'd, and left behind ripe victory. 46 To gather which, imperial Rodolf sent The forward Prince of Megalopolis: A noble General He, and bravely bent; But yet against the bold impetuousness Of stern-fac'd Mamalukes too weak to stand, He yields his neck to wear a Captive's band. 47 These unsuccessful Expeditions' shame Awak'd the Christians' utmost indignations; Who in religious Throngs to Syria came With hopes as high as were their Preparations; Yet both by baneful Pride invenom'd were, Which soon atchiev'd more than the Turks could dare. 48 For as fond Huntsmen, riding to the chase, Wrangle and quarrel for the Lyon's skin As yet uncaught, until their Strife increase To such Intemperance, that their whole Design It undermines, and makes them readier to Chase one another, than that common fo. 49 So here the Christians, who all hunting went For Salem's Crown; before the Prize they gain, Into disputing factions are rent About their right and title there to reign. Not one but thought his Plea the best, and each Eagerly caught that which was still to catch. 50 The Kings of England, Cyprus, Sicily, And France; the Pisans, Florentines, and Pope; The Prince of Antioch, Count of Tripoly, The Genovese, and the Venetian's hope, So did the Hospitals, and Templers too; That Justice could not, durst not, say them No. 51 Thus while this cursed War of Contestation Protracts the Holy one; the Soldiers, who Grow, like their Weapons, rusty by Cessation, No other business finding now to do But to be Wicked, through each neighbour town Run havocking and plundering up and down. 52 At these unmanly Wrongs the Pagans grew Both in their Rage and in their Courage high; And Vengeance joining with their Legions, flew Upon their quarreling foes' Impiety, Till by a quick and general Defeat All Christians out of Syria they beat. 53 They beat them out of Syria, and out Of all that fertile Bravery, whereby Their frequent Armies they to Salem brought With fresh Recruits of zealous Piety: Their Courage now lies dead and cold at home, Which us'd to live about their Savior's Tomb. 54 Yet not so dead, but it revives again Into a Life much worse than Death; since They With most unchristian Rage have learn'd to stain Their Swords in one another's blood, and play The Turks among themselves, whom they were wont More nobly from their Syrian Dens to hunt. 55 The Cross must now against the Cross be spred, (Blush Heav'n and Earth at this!) and they who are To Peace's King in strict allegiance bred Be barbarized by a mutual War; Tearing that gentle Legacy which He Dearly bequeathed to their custody. 56 They who are in one sacred Body knit By mystick Union, no foes will seek But their fraternal Members; and forget That whilst on them their salvage spight they wreak, The tender Head feels every Wound and will Score up each drop, which of his Blood they spill. 57 Weep all good eyes which see this horrid shame Of Christians digging christian bowels up. With what pretence can we the Pagans blame! Our Wars, our own dire Wars, our mouths will stop. We tutor them, and shew their Rage the way: If we suck Christian blood, why may not they! 58 Had but the thousand part of those dear veins Adventur'd to be broach'd in Palestine, 'T had wash'd out both our Cowardize's stains, And black Mahometism: yea Greece had been Redeemed also, and no longer lain A groaning slave under a pagan chain. 59 Or had that Power of Policy, of Wrath, Of Arms, of Horse, of Men, and stronger Gold, Which in our self-destroying Britain hath Of late been lavish'd out, when England sold Her Bliss to Misery, with provident And pious Ardor been in Syria spent: 60 Had that blind Madness of our costly Zeal Which joined in a Covenant to destroy The Churche's and the Kingdom's glorious weal, But chose its venturous fervor to imploy Against true Tyrants, and been christened Into a just and holy League indeed; 61 Our guilty Swords had now not blushed in Fraternal blood: nor had our wretched Bays Deflour'd with English Sighs and Curses bin; But Salem's face had shin'd in freedom's rays, And from her long-press'd neck th'unworthy Yoke Of Ottomanick Barbarism been broke. 62 As loth was Psyche Salem to forsake As are our Banners thither to advance: She oft look'd back her long Adieu to take With weeping eyes and blubber'd countenance; But when the Hills she could no longer spy Let Blindness now, say'd She, lock up mine eye. 63 And with such potent passion did she breath That sigh-clogg'd Word, as made her Phylax start; For lo, the pallid characters of Death Star'd in her daunted face, and every Part Ghastly proclaim'd her soul was thither fled From whence her Body now was hurried. 64 In application of his cordial Powers Had not her dextrous Guardian nimble been, His Psyche's eyes in these their amorous showers Had their own final deluge found, and seen No more for ever: with such boundless rage Acts Love, when female bosoms are his stage. 65 (And ask me not, What makes this Passion prove So bravely stubborn in the softest hearts? Thy self the Answer feel'st, if genuine Love On thee e'r tryed his mysterious darts. If not; 'tis vain to tell thee Riddles which Pose all but deep Experience's reach.) 66 But quick as is the influence of Light, New vigorous Spirits he breaths into her breast; Which thrilling through her veins, chas'd out the night Of languid Cold from its congealed Nest; And wak'd her blood, bidding it rise, and thaw Her cheeks, and lips, and forehead's frozen snow. 67 Psyche look'd up; but toward Salem bent Her fruitless eye, and then she groan'd anew. Courage my Dear, said Phylax, be content, Thou all hast seen in Salem worth thy view. 'Tis time that to thine Albion thou thy great And holy Pilgrimages now relate. 68 'Tis time to check those Distances which make Britain a stranger unto Salem; time That thy narration others teach to break Though still at home, through all this foreign Clime; Whilst they, attending what thy tongue declares, Travel not by their feet, but by their ears. 69 As when a friend unwelcome things propounds, His other Self (who has no power to be Right-down displeas'd at whatsoever sounds From those beloved lips, which faithful He Holds dearer than his own,) displays the smart In his Eye's mirror, of his wounded heart: 70 The dainty anguish of her loving Look Thus Psyche open lays to Phylax view; That he might read in that pathetick book How this Return's Alarm her Comforts slew. But when he seem'd that language not to ken, Her lips thus to interpret it began: 71 Between two Deaths, which shall poor Psyche choose! 'Tis death my Guardian's motions to resist; And death, religious Salem's sweets to loose: And but of one poor Life am I possest. Yet had I more, my straits were still the same; For all were due to Thee, and all to Them. 72 O dear Protector of my Joys, and Me, Divide not now thy Charge: Had I not been Conducted hither by thy Piety, Mine eyes had ne'r adored Palestine, Nor been enchanted by the precious Graces Which have indear'd these consecrated Places. 73 I had not now forgot, or scorned all The World beside; which is but Dirt indeed To this pure Soil; whose Riches justly call Tagus and Ganges poor; as being bred By his prolifick Heav'nly rays alone Whom Righteousness owns for her Sovereign Sun. 74 And of these Jewels must I robbed be By none but dearest Thee! Had open foes Thus absolutely wrack'd and ruin'd me, I might have grapled with my single Woes; But springing now from unsuspected Thee Much more than double all my losses be. 75 Ah what has Albion that can entertain A soul from Salem snatch'd, from Salem, which Queen in the World's heart chosen was to reign; Whilst Albion's Clime doth us her Vileness teach: Whom nature threw into the West and sought How from the Universe to kick her out. 76 Arimathean Joseph's Tomb indeed Is there, that something that poor Isle might have: But O, the sight of that, will only feed The fire which burns me for his other Grave, His other Grave in which my Spouse did lie Far far from Britain whither thou wouldst fly. 77 When in the loftiest Air the Whale can live, When in the bottom of the Sea the Lark, When Cancer can to Winter welcome give, When Highnoon can inhabit in the Dark, When Britain can to Salem shipped be, Then may it prove a fitting Home for me. 78 But until then, I only thither go Bearing my woful Carcase to my tomb, Since thou sweet-bitter friend wilt have it so, And not vouchsafe in Palestine a Home For now most-banish'd Psyche. Here a stream Of tears flow'd down from her, and softned Him. 79 Nay I am not so hard says he, but I Can melt by fewer drops of thine than those: Come, wipe thine eyes, for thou shalt instantly Live in those Joys thou hold'st it death to loose. With that, he slop'd the Rein, and wheel'd about And smiling Psyche back to Salem brought. 80 She smil'd; but sober He confess'd no signs Of jollity at this Returning; for By his profounder judgment he divines That Land, however holy, would to her Scarce prove a trusty Sanctuary, since His and her Master's summons call'd her thence. 81 Yet He, still true to his own guardian Care, A fitting Mansion for the Virgin sought; A mean and private House, retired far Both from Temptation's and from Tumult's rout: Which he replenished with plain, but pure And Piety-becoming furniture. 82 But when the sweetness of his Court'sy here Had settled her; his brows he sadly knit, And cry'd, with earnest awful Looks, my Dear, Thou seest what order I have took to fit Thy longing and thy Lodging too; but now A gift more useful I 'l on Thee bestow. 83 'Tis my Advice; of which th'hast greater need Than here to sojourn; for thy fixing here Doth all that mystick mighty danger breed, Which by thy life I thee conjure to fear. Thy life at Salem is in peril, which Had been in Albion out of Danger's reach. 84 Where Waters fairlyest smile, and smoothest flow, The deepest Gulfs beneath in ambush lie; Where in their briskest beauties Roses grow, Of Thorns springs up a thick Conspiracy; All Poisons then most active are and bold When they are lodg'd in pompous Pearl and Gold. 85 Sweet Paradise was not so safe, but there The worst of Serpents in its Sweets could dwell: And though to Thee Heav'n seems descended here, Yet even in Salem thou may'st meet with Hell. I grant the Serpent here was slain, but yet Their fragments Snakes know how again to knit. 86 Trust not their glittering skins, which wooe the eye With gorgeous baits; for thick Enchantments are Enammel'd in their out-side Bravery, And holy Traps and Treacheries they wear; With wiley art they wind about, and glide, And into unsuspecting holes they slide. 87 Trust not their Tongue (which is indeed a Sting,) Though fairly tipp'd with golden Courtesy All Heav'n roll'd up in Promises it bring, And Wisdom's winning Sweetness. Was not, ye Shall be as Gods, discerning good and evil, A gallant word? yet minted by the Devil. 88 Let it thy Wisdom be to take due heed Of being wiser than thy faith; beware That no capricious Longing make thee feed On outside Learning's baits; but wiselyer fear The lurking holes of Heresy, least thou Besotted prov'st by Coveting to know. 89 Remember, here thy Spouse was once betray'd; Remember, here three times he was deny'd; Remember, well thy self a feeble Maid; Remember, thy Agenor, and thy Pride; Remember, what Rebellion fir'd thy Passions; Remember, Aphrodisius's Protestations. 90 Remember, what from Charis, and from Me, Thy Soul receiv'd; and let no Siren's song Bewitch those ears with killing harmony In which the blessed Tunes of Heav'n have rung. Watch well this Humor of thy Zeal which may Its overweening self and Thee betray. 91 Lock up these Counsels in thine heart, and there Safe let them lie for me till I come back. Thy Trust and Love shall hence to me appear If of these Pawns thou faithful care shalt take; These Pawns, which will my guardian Wings supply Though from thy presence far away I fly. 92 Away I must; for this Heav'n's pleasure is, And therefore must be mine, and should be thine. I business have abroad; but by this Kiss, (And here he took his leave,) the truth of mine Affection, Psyche, on thy lip I seal: Keep this Impression safe, and so farewel. 93 Away this Word, and He, together flew: For now the King of Souls thought fit to teach Psyche how little of her heart she knew, Who thought it raised past Delusion's reach. To her own strength she now was left, that she How short it fell of that stout Name might see. 94 But when her Guardian thus outflew her view, On her most sudden Desolation she Star'd round about, and 'gan her cheeks to dew. But strait revolving that her heart was free With her obtain'd Abode to satisfy Its curious fervency, she ceas'd to sigh. 95 Then in a modest Veil her face she hid, Leaving her eyes but room her way to see; Zeal furnished her feet with wings of Speed, And on she made amain to Calvary, Afresh her Savior's Tortures to lament; Not thinking that to her own Cross she went. 96 Thus Peter with too venturous Piety Crouded into the Highpriest's dangerous hall, To view and to bewail the Tragedy Of Jesus's injur'd Innocence: but all The fruit his Boldness reap'd him, was, that he Deny'd Him whom he took such pains to see: 97 Mean while, all pious Hearts' eternal Fo, Who to intrap them keeps perpetual watch, Observing her without her Guardian go, Judg'd this his only time his prey to catch: He posted to a special Fury's den, Whose Snakes all started up as He rush'd in. 98 But whilst rouz'd She in thousand hisses spoke Her Sovereign's welcom: Peace my Child, say'd He, Part of my Errand's Haste, and cannot brook These Complements' delay: I have for thee A piece of service, which will better prove How much thy Father Satan thou dost love. 99 Psyche, a thing to Jesus's wonderous dear, (And therefore full as odious to Me, Who by his Love am always pointed where I ought to shoot my Spight,) is that coy She Whom though my Craft hath often baited, yet Back in my face the poison still she spit. 100 I Aphrodisius and Agenor sent, And genuine Feinds they prov'd themselves to be; About their hellish work they wisely went, And faithfully they ply'd their Treachery: But yet, good Devils, their fair-driven Plot, So cunning was that Wench, they finish'd not. 101 And yet this Art in her poor silly brain Was never bred; O no, abus'd we are; And Heav'n, though We to it give fair and plain Defiance, underhand maintain's this War. There thou long since had Psyche drowned seen In sulphure, had it not for Phylax been. 102 He, base unworthy Spirit as he is, Not only stoops to Christ (which gallant We Of old disdain'd, and still that Scorn profess) But with intolerable flattery Turns Page to Dust, and blusheth not to bow From heav'n to wait on this vile Worm below. 103 Had he not better nobly Fall'n with Us, And kept the Credit of his highborn Mind; Than crouch, and sneak, and curry favor thus Of that proud Tyrant? Can an Angel find Christ's love and smile, worth being hackny'd down Far more below himself than we are thrown! 104 For my part, were I freely now to choose, I would accept the bottom of my Hell And hug Damnation; rather than with those Ignoble Sons of Earth a Servant dwell. Those guardian Angels think We cursed be: Fools, who perceive not their own Slavery! 105 They boast, Heav'n's King's their Sovereign; and I Take these confessing Vassals at their word: But, I 'l maintain 't, 'tis greater Dignity To have him for my Fo, than for my Lord. They brag that Heav'n's their own, and Blisses Hill; Why I have more than so, I have my Will. 106 And so have they, if you 'l the Fools believe, Who say Their Master's Pleasure is their own. But may not any Slaves say so, and give Their Angel-ships the Lie? By my dread Crown I swear, it is my bitterest agony To think such Dastards are of kin to Me. 107 But now, my Daughter, Phylax is away; His servile Deligence thou need'st not fear; Left to her Self his Pupil is to day, And therefore left to us, if with due care Thou play'st thy part; for on thine Industry Alone I build thy hopes of Victory. 108 She now is crawling up to Calvary, The hill which more than Heav'n it self I hate; And therefore scorn in person to come nigh That cursed Place. It stands not with the state Of royal and immortal Lucifer To smell the stink of Jesus's Sepulchre. 109 But for thy Father's sake and service Thou This once shalt stop thy nose and venture thither: Where thou a subtile chain of Snakes shalt throw About that peevish Wench, and hale her hither. So at her cheated Spouse, and Her, both I And Thou will laugh out our Eternity. 110 His foaming lips he closed here, which beat The flood of flaming sulphure back into His monstrous throat. Strait at his burning feet His damned Daughter took her leave; and so With headlong fury rushed through the Earth, And mingled with the Air in breaking forth. 111 In this she flew above suspition's eye, And shot her unseen self into the breasts Of divers Mortals, where she formerly Had entertainment found: but now her Nests She feathered anew with greater store Of treacherous Powers than there she left before. 112 Her Policy was so profound, that She For Psyche laid her Nets in others' hearts; Which she imbellish'd by the bravery Of most refined sublimated Arts. To cheat poor Birds, by craftiest Fowler's wit Such dangerous Decoys were never set. 113 For though She were the nasty Center, where All Lines of ugliness and Horror met; The looks of Beauty she knew how to wear, Making dissembled Faith appear so sweet That she the wisest and most piercing Eyes Had often blinded by quaint Fallacies. 114 Oft has she forc'd such Graces to unite In her Attire, that Truth's inamoring face Hath shin'd with less Command; oft has the sight Of her bewitching Mirror, from the Glass Of Heav'n the credit won, and made her be Or God, or more at least Believ'd than He. 115 But now the Virgin at the doleful Mount Arrived was, resolving at her dear Redeemer's Crosse's foot to ease the fount Of her impatient gravid Eyes: but there A strange Devoto prepossest her room, Who yet of her own Errand seem'd to come. 116 His Looks, though guilty of few years, were yet Grown pale and old with pious Gravity; His sober garb was sutable, and fit For one who would not brave, but clothed be: His body thin, but thick his hair, which grown To uncontroll'd length, on his back flow'd down. 117 Upon the ground he lay, and beat his breast, Which echoed back the Blows with groans and sighs: At length by thick importunate Knocking prest It yielded forth these correspondent Cries: O Griefs and Pains, had you no other Heart But His, to make the sink of all your Smart! 118 That Heart! the fountain of all sweetest Grace, That Heart! to which the best of Joyes were due; That Heart! where not the least Demerit was To waken Justice, and to call for you; The Heart of Jesus! here a boistrous Groan Would needs break off his Lamentation. 119 But then recovering his sad tongue again, Alas, said he, and why are you unjust? Why from this breast of mine do you refrain, Which all your utmost Stings deserveth? Must Dear He, who more than Heav'n's delights did merit Alone the dregs of Passion inherit? 120 Are there no Whips, no Thorns, no Nails for Me? For this young fitter back of mine no Cross? No shame; no remnant of Calamity Left for my due reward? Did he engross What sinful I had better title to? Surely this Want of Woes shall be my Wo. 121 As when the hollow Winds have drove together Black lagging clouds, the gravid Vapor breaks With its own weight, and pours the sousing weather Down through the gloomy air: so on his cheeks His labouring eyes let loose their flood, and leave To Sorrow's most tempestuous deluge gave. 122 And now his Lips no more had power to speak In zealous Kisses he their strength employ'd: He kiss'd the Soil, where once that Blood did reek Which all the Earth's redemption fully pay'd. And every Kiss did new desire beget Of more affectionate embracing it. 123 Psyche observing his strong Passion swell With such Devotion, soon forgot her own; And with the Stranger in such love she fell That at his honored feet she bowed down: She bowed down, and little thought that then She stoop'd to enter her forbidden Gin. 124 But as the warey Seaman, when he spies The amiable Mermaid floating nigh, Turns from the dangerous Bait his jealous eyes, Hoiseth his Sail, makes haste his oars to ply: So this Devoto seeing Psyche there Confess'd and fortify'd his holy Fear. 125 For starting at the unexpected sight, Shield me, my blessed Guardian, said he: Satan, whose Craft with everlasting spight Disturbs the course of zealous Piety, Hath, to facilitate my Molestation In this fair Damsel sent me my Temptation. 126 Ill hast thou chose thy scene, mistaken Maid, For this is Purity's own Theatre. In vain hath all inamoring Grace array'd Thy cheeks and eyes to court Desire; for here No Love can live, but unto Him who hath Quickned it by His dear and potent Death. 127 Hence therefore, hence, and seek thy putid Prey Where rampant Lust in furious bonfires reigns: Thy Beauty's Lustre must not thaw its way Thorough my tame and now long-cooled veins. How know I but thou art some fair-dress'd Feind To make me foul? and here himself he sign'd. 128 Ravish'd with this religious Jealousy Thy Handmaid, Sir, said Psyche, hither came Upon that Errand which thy Piety Hath here dispatched; in that very room I purpos'd my devoted Sighs to blow And make mine Eyes their liquid duty know. 129 My bounteous Lord took my Intent, I see, For actual Deed; and hath rewarded it: He knew no Blessing could more welcome be Unto my heart, than this which here I meet: For this art Thou, in whom I plainly read The love of Him who of my soul is head. 130 I heard thy holy Sighs and hearty Groans As up to heav'n from thy sweet breast they flew; I heard thy generous Lamentations; And by those genuine characters I knew That Jesus had by his soul-conquering Dart Engrav'd Heav'n's best Impression on thy heart. 131 I thank thee that thou wert of me afraid; Such pious fear I reverently admire: Yet be assured Thou hast met a Maid In whom there glows no embers of black fire. No, no: my heart abhors such guests as those Since she tricks of Aphrodisius knows. 132 I might indeed have been, what you suspected, Foul Satan's Agent, and a Feind of hell; Had our dear Lord His worthless Worm neglected, And not seal'd sure on Mine His blessed Will. And so might'st Thou, had He not spread above Thy helpless head the banner of His Love. 133 That Love, which wheresoe'r I find it shine Must humblest reverence from my heart command. Wonder not at my Case, but make it thine, And think how thou could'st possibly withstand Thy charming Self: if I immodest be, Like Love will pardon Love's immodesty. 134 Yet 'tis no Boldness with th'attractive Sun To fall in love; or with, what lovelyer is, Pure Virtue's face: what ravish'd I have done, To Thee, great Jesus gave me leave to His Own self to do; O then no more admire That I grow warm, now I come near thy fire. 135 My Warmth is pure, as is its Spring in Thee, And doth as much adulterous Heats detest: For only on thy zealous Piety The hunger of my chaste Desires I feast. I am a Stranger here, and hither come Religion's Merchant from my British home. 136 But in this Land of Holiness I meet Such rare, such price-transcending Wares, that I Desire my native Albion to forget, And where my Savior did, both live and die. Me thinks I here am nearest Him, who is Whither I live or die, mine only Bliss. 137 Yet not so near, but mighty Distance still Doth interpose, and Him divide from Me: Witness the sacred Marks on yonder Hill Engrav'd to His Ascension's memory. And how shall Psyche meet Him now, but in Some Saint in whom His Image here doth shine? 138 Wherefore some heav'n-inflam'd Companion I Would gladly gain, with whom my Soul might live In holy Friendship's sweet society, And mutual Heats of Zeal from him receive. And since Heav'n puts you in my way, O be True to your self, and you 'l be kind to me. 139 This said: sometimes to Him her pleading Eye, Somtimes to Heav'n she turn'd; and by that mute But most mysterious Importunity Solicited her earnest-bashful Sute; By yielding Silence wisely urging more Strong arguments than she had spoke before. 140 Mov'd with her soft Expressions and her Tears (For these flow'd out as thick and fast as they,) The Man gives credit unto both, and cheers His clouded looks, and cries, O happy day Which to my admiration shew'st a Breast Of heav'n's pure Dove the chaste and comely Nest. 141 Pardon dear Stranger, pardon my Mistake, And be no longer in that Name to me. The best amends I can, I vow to make To my misprised slander'd Piety. I at thy bounteous Offer catch, and will Both thy Desires and mine own Joyes fulfil. 142 Rare are those Friends as Birds of Paradise But seldom seen in this unworthy Earth, Whose hearts in one no other Cement ties But heav'nly Zeal and Love. O were my Worth As great's my Vileness, that thy Servant might With equal Court'sy this of thine requite! 143 If by the royal Law of Love's great Lord Precious in our esteem our Foes must be; What what Embraces must we then afford To them who us outvy in Charity! Come gentle Soul, and this chaste token take That to thy Wish my heart I pliant make. 144 Here by an holy Kiss (for that of old The Symbole was of Christian Consent,) He seal'd his words: then taking reverent hold Of her right hand, he down the Mountain went, Leading her to his Dwelling; whither she Trip'd cheerly on, and fear'd no Treachery. 145 (Into the Vulture's Nest thus flies the Dove; Thus to the smiling Shelfs the Ship doth run; The Stranger thus into th'enchanted Grove Hastes for delight; Thus to the fatal den Of fairest-tongu'd Hyenas skips the Lamb; The Child thus leaps into the playing Flame.) 146 Arrived there; Authades (such his Name, And such his Nature was,) prays her that since She in a busy season thither came, She would attend with friendly patience What might not be deferred: but, said he, The Work though great, will soon dispatched be. 147 In his eighth journey now fair Phebus ran Since his Firstborn Authades did enjoy; Who by the Rule of his Religion Was bound to Circumcise the Child that day: Which with a consecrated knife of stone He did, and gave his own Name to his Son. 148 The Infant's wound the softer heart did lance Of Psyche, who strait wept, and knock'd her breast, And testify'd her sad Impatience. But watchful He perceiving how his Guest Disrelished her Welcome, to her stept, And, weeping first, demanded why she wept? 149 So when the bleating Sheep in Samuel's ear Proclaim'd the Sin of his rapacious Prince: At which the pious Prophet, vext to hear What heav'n and He did hate, took just offence; Remorsless Saul pretended still that he Admired why the Saint displeas'd should be. 150 She made in sullen silence her Reply Compos'd of Frowns and of complete Disdain; Till forc'd by his mild Importunity She gave her angry Tongue a liberal rein: Shame on my credulous Love, which thus, said she, Bewitch'd me to the Den of Heresy. 151 Are you the Man who crouched to the Place Of Jesus's Cross with such profound regret? How come you now to wear a Jewish face, And with your Circumcision Whittle cut Your Christian mask in pieces? Blind were I, As was your Zeal, this Fraud could I not spy. 152 Had you believ'd that Jesus's blood was shed To wash the stains of all the World away, Your cruel Heresy had not made red Your Infant in his needless blood to day; Who had been purer, in the gentler stream Of holy Baptism had you drenched him. 153 Upon the Christian's God you faun in vain Whilst thus you mock His Merits, and prevent Those high Prerogatives of Power which reign In His all-clean all-cleansing Sacrament: For how can you be to His service true, Yet dare to consecrate your Son a Jew? 154 I see what reason my wise Guardian had To be so jealous of my Staying here; Why he so solemnly appeared sad When I was merry and refus'd to fear. He knew black Satan would himself array In Light, my too soft Softness to betray. 155 Here she was flinging out. But flattering He By Christ's great Cross, and by His greater Name Pray'd and conjur'd her pious Charity His unexamin'd Action not to blame; But to defer her Censure, and to hear With patience, how he could his Cause declare. 156 Such power breath'd from that high Contestation On Psyche's tender heart, that she relented: When expert He, with crafty commendation Of her mild Candor, told her he repented That by a Declaration's Preface He Had not made way to that Solemnity. 157 Her to a private chamber then he brought, That no Disturbance might his Ends prevent; And by all ceremonious Service sought To calm her angry thoughts with kind content; For, on a silken couch when she was set, With softer language thus he 'gan the feat: 158 Sure now dear Stranger, thou art quit with me, And hast repaid me in my proper Coin: For Hell's foul Agent I suspected Thee, Thou for an Heretick dost me define. But I recanted; and if Thou do so, Quit on the other side we may be too. 159 If headlong Jealousy for Proof should pass, What thing so perilous were as Innocence? How deplorable was our Saviour's Case When God, a Devil deemed was? and whence Shall we acquit His wise Apostles, who In this fond World's esteem for Fools did go? 160 Thou prov'dst not what my sudden fear did speak, Nor am I such as thine did me present, Truth can, if heard, her self transparent make, And never fail'd to yield compleat content To those whom Prejudice's poison had Not first envenomed and partial made. 161 Know then, that I am one of those whose breasts Are consecrated to that Lord whom Thou Alone adorest; and permit no guests To thrust in thither, who will not allow That gentle Sovereign His throne to rear And reign without all contradiction there. 162 The poor contemptuous Place whence glorious He Vouchsaf'd His Surname to assume, is that Whence, imitating His humility, We draw our common Title: wonder not That Christian, we forbear; too high it is; Plain Nazareen, our Ambition doth suffice. 163 Before the Dictates of His royal Law With universal Meekness we submit; Whilst others but by halfes will deign to bow, As Umpiers, not as Subjects unto it. All hard and costly Precepts they refuse, And leave that burden for the slavish Jews. 164 They tell the World, that they a Patent have Writ in the stile of Christian Liberty, By which heav'n's King to them Commission gave To break the bonds of Legal Slavery. A wise King sure the while they make Him, who Allows them what His Law forbids to do. 165 And is not this a choise Religion, where No more is left for any Charge or Pains? Cunning and thrifty its Professors are, Who in their own hands moderate the Reins Which on their necks should lie; who, as they please Dispose their Discipline to their own ease. 166 And yet 'twere well, would they their Charter show Which constituted them Free States; or but Declare what in the new-delivered Law Doth check and disannul the Old one; that The World might satisfaction gain, and We Be made Partakers of their Liberty. 167 For we know no such thing: but this we know That Jesus, who is Author of the New, Was Institutor of the Ancient Law; And upon Sinai's head His trumpet blew To wake the drowsy World's obedient ear Unto the Precepts which He thundred there. 168 And did He then Retract the Rite He had Before ordain'd? was Circumcision there Repeal'd, and Abraham's Badge decre'd too sad A load for Abraham's faithful Sons to bear? O no! such Changings inconsistant be With wisest God's Immutability. 169 Like His pure Self, His Laws eternal are, And need no Reformation or Corrections: Our inconsiderate Lawgivers here Infect their Laws with their own Imperfections, And both may mended be: Which surely 'tis Blasphemous pride to say of Him, or His. 170 But of His Laws the surest Explication Is His Example: What did righteous He When fitted by His blessed Incarnation He could, like Us, to them a Subject be? Did He not set the seal of His own Blood To Circumcision that this Law was good? 171 His Presentation in the Temple shews His clear Submission to that Statute there; No less exactly than the strictest Jews He solemniz'd the Festivals which were Legally sacred; and though Death drew near, Still spar'd He time to keep the Passover. 172 Let Error cast the blustering scare-crow Name Of Heresy on this our genuine Zeal; We trust we never shall repute it shame His steps to tread who is our King: nor shall The proud World beat our Resolution down, Since Christ will His own Followers surely own. 173 The Gospel Laws we equally embrace: And though my Son I circumcised, yet Him off I cut not from Baptismal Grace: We in that Laver too our Children wet, That in this double Sacramental stream Of blood and water they to God may swim. 174 We grant, that where the Circumcision Blood Blusheth not to oppose and useless make That venerable World-redeeming Flood Which from the precious Veins of Jesus brake, The Sacrament's heretical: but we Teach it more meek and mannerly to be. 175 We bring it home, and tutor it to do Its homage nearer than it did of old: We use it as th'officious Usher to The Mystery which it at first foretold: We teach it to fore-run, but not prevent The nobler Stream of Baptism's Sacrament. 176 If of too much Obedience now We seem Guilty to Thee, convince us of our sin: 'Tis plain thou hast an hopeful pleasant Theme, And easily upon our hearts may'st win, If Truth fight with thee; for what Mortal's He Who by just Licence would not conquer'd be? 177 He ceased here. But as the loathing Vine Though in the Coleworts she can plainly read No hostile humor; cannot but decline Their touch, and any pois'nous Shrub or Weed Will rather hug with all her Arms, than by The least Embrace accept that Company: 178 So Psyche, though she could not easily show The venome of Authades' Sophistry; Yet her reluctant heart could not allow What she could not confute: Much rather she Can with fell Adders' hisses fall in love Than his Discourse's dire design approve. 179 For Discontent still gather'd up her brow, Still nauseous Neglect stream'd from her eye, Still on her Guardian's Word she chew'd; and now The Serpent had his pois'nous Suavity Display'd, with scornful silence She reply'd, And wav'd her hand, and turn'd her head aside. 180 But Logos (as with Thelema he lay Close in her breast,) prickt up his jolly ear, And drunk in all Authades had to say With such delight, that he could not forbear Now Psyche seem'd unsatisfy'd, to break His itching mind; and thus he freely spake: 181 Madam, although the Jewish Law to you Expired seems, yet that of Courtesy You needs must still to be in date allow: And why will then your Looks transgressors be? Why with such glances of Disdain must they Your gentle Entertainment here repay? 182 It was his Goodness mildly to digest The Scorn which you at first upon him threw; And this new Kindness might deserve at least Civil acceptance. Whether false, or true You find his Arguments, you must confess His Love unfain'd, his Carriage Christian is. 183 And yet if Logos ever understood What firm perspicuous Probations meant, What Reasons solid were, what Topicks good, What Demonstrations sound; I must consent That he hath none but such Materials chose His strong Discourse's fabrick to compose. 184 And, let me tell you, Reason is a Law By God's own hand ingrav'd in every breast, Which must no Change nor Antiquation know; A Law, which whosoever dares resist, Rebels against himself, whom stamping under His obstinate feet, he Nature tears in sunder. 185 O strive not then more wise to be, than what Is Wisdom's only Rule: Authades now By Reason's genuine lustre shews you that He walks in highnoon Light; and why will you Be groping still in Darkness, when you may By his fair Pharus's conduct sail to Day? 186 Stung by this Check, Psyche began to groan: When lo, her Thelema took courage, and With most resolved count'nance, fastned on Logos his shoulder her imperious hand; Which shak'd him from his boldness into fear, And summon'd to her words his humbler ear. 187 Pert Sir, said she, do's it to you belong The golden reins of Psyche's heart to guide, That thus you stretch your magisterial tongue To twit your Sovereign? To compleat your pride, Y' had best e'n take her throne, and make both me And Her, attend your upstart Majesty. 188 His soft smug words tickle your wanton ear; But to such easy Charms we must not yield: Both Psyche's stomach is too weak to bear, And so is mine, his gilded Dose, though fill'd With sugard blandishments. Yet ask not, Why: It is enough for Us but to Deny. 189 This peremtory sentence, at her feet Threw Logos down, and held him quaking there: Much wrong'd he thought himself, yet durst not beat With vain Complaints his angred Prince's ear. Themselves thus Rebels always injur'd deem Because their Kings refuse to bow to them. 190 Authades marking how his dainty Bait Disgusted was, to heav'n lift up his eye, And cry'd, Alass that dangerous Deceit Should be suspected in Truth's arms to lie! Yet, Psyche, dare not I disprove thy fear: The wisest Souls, most jealous always are. 191 And this thy pious Jealousy to me So precious is, that it inflames my heart With higher estimation of Thee Who in Faith's bus'ness shie and tender art. They who with headlong haste such Points receive; In truth do only Fancy, not Believe. 192 I grant 'twas thy Unhappiness that Thou Met'st with so faint a Disputant as I: And sure our Cause were feeble, could it show No better Pillars of its verity Than my Abilities, which I confess Are full as slender as That solid is. 193 Yet why should Truth for my unworthy sake Fail of her welcome in thy precious breast? Why should'st Thou pay so dearly for my Lack Of Eloquence or Logick, as to rest In that unfortunate Mistake content, Which though I cannot help, I must lament. 194 That word broke ope the fountain of his eyes, Which in deceitful pity flowed down: But smiting then his crafty breast, he cries, Yet should I think just Heav'n on Thee hath thrown The Punishment of this my Weakness, and Because I'm dull, not let Thee understand! 195 O no! would'st thou to yonder house with me But condescend to step, Thou clearly there The Looks of living Piety should'st see, And from an Oracle Resolutions hear. If thou repent thee (which can never be) Heap all the blame, I am content, on me. 196 Blame me and rank me in the vilest list Of toads and spiders: publish me to be What most I hate, an Enemy to Christ, To Truth, to Goodness, and to gracious Thee, If Satisfaction stands not ready there With heav'nly Light thy misty Doubts to clear. 197 The solemn guise of this prest Kindness was So potent that soft Psyche yields, and goes With her fair-tongu'd Companion: Alas, That facil Hearts should to themselves be foes Whilst others they with facilness befriend; That pliant Twigs should break, because they bend. 198 But in that House, they at his Prayers find A Man whom Age had covered with snow: Yet noble fervor in his zealous Mind With more than youthful Vigor seem'd to glow; So strong was his Devotion, and so high In all expressions of Love's ecstasy. 199 Authades at his back strait kneeled down, And so did Psyche, much amaz'd to see How far that old Devoto had outflown The flagging pitch of her young Piety. Such flaming prayers she never heard before, Nor such impetuous Knocks at th'heav'nly door. 200 Still still she looked when the spheres should ope And to the longing Saint his Lord disclose. She wonder'd that his Body flew not up Whose towring Soul on such stout pinions rose. It pos'd her thoughts to see his working Heart. Stretching so high, did not in sunder start. 201 With secret checks her languid Soul she chid Which with such violence never yet did flame; Her Eyes hung down; her Cheeks were overspred With blushing (but with O how guiltless) shame. Nor ravish'd less was Thelema, although The Nazareens she had abhorr'd till now. 202 But with confessing looks she here forgave And praised Logos whom she chode before, And jolly He grown insolently brave, To see how Fortune her consent did pour Upon his Verdict, hop'd that thenceforth He In Thelema's own realm supreme should be. 203 O Looks, and outside Things, how mighty are And how substantial your Impostures, on Unwarey Mortals, who their judgment square By ear and eye, and those vain Rules alone They borrow from the Senses' school, wherein How many Beasts more learned are than Men! 204 Pseudagius now three times bow'd down his face In mystick Adoration, and arose. Authades strait in Reverence's pace Step'd forward his sly bus'ness to disclose: But Psyche pluck'd him back, and told him, He So bold on her account now need not be. 205 Pardon me Sir, said she; my vanquish'd Mind Convinc'd by how much more than Reason is! In Him I such commanding Goodness find That, though I would not, yet I must profess That Faith which nobly authoriz'd I see By such irrefragable Piety. 206 The crest of my Desires, (if yet it be Not pride to reach at such transcendent bliss,) Is, that his Leave would dignify poor Me With his religious Acquaintance: This Perhaps may be inable to repay The Debt your Love hath laid on me to day. 207 Authades glad and proud that he had thus This conquest gained, bad her be secure. Then meekly bowing to Pseudagius, Regard most holy Sir, said he, the pure And pious sute of this right virtuous Maid, Which modest she upon my tongue hath laid. 208 Heav'n's love hath kindled in her pliant breast Full Approbation of whatever she Beholds amongst us Nazareens profest, And she our Proselite resolves to be. Only she begs that you would not disdain Her, as your lowlyest friend to entertain. 209 His solemn eye to Heav'n Pseudagius cast, And cry'd, forbid it blessed Jesu, I Should not be kind to any whom Thou hast In thine own Favour deignd to raise so high. In Thee, a Condescent, but nothing less In me a Worm who crawle below, is this. 210 Which said; in sober pleasantness he came, And grave acquaintance took of Psyche's lip, She, big with humble thanks, cry'd out, Who am Unworthy I, such holy Sweets to sip! Hadst Thou vouchsaf'd me but thy feet to kiss, That favour I had hugged as my Bliss. 211 Thus cheated She her Misery admires, As doth the silly Fly the beauteous flame; Little surmising what outrageous fires Reign'd in that Bait which look'd so mild and tame. Ne'r did she stand on such a Brink as this, And never feared less a Precipice. CANTO XVIII. The Poyson. The ARGUMENT. The rankling Bane of Error on the heart Of heedless Psyche greater strength doth get: Fond Logos plyeth his capricious part, And slie Agyrtes works the deadly Feat. Phylax returns, and in his Pupil's eye Rakes up the nasty Sink of Heresy. 1 No more did wretched I; who lately thought My self pitch'd safe on Happiness's throne: Ah slippery Throne! how sadly hast thou taught My credulous Joys no more to build upon A mortal bottom, nor my Solace trust On what so soon falls into mouldring Dust. 2 O where shall I my just Complaint begin, Which must no Ending know! How am I lost In Sorrow's Maze! fain would my mourning Pen Vie with mine Eyes, and drop my Grief as fast: Fain would my Muse, to complement my Smart, Indite the funeral Elegy of my Heart. 3 But by the Ruins of my high Delight Such vast Confusion overwhelms my Mind, That it can prompt me nothing now to write But meer Perplexity. Thy pardon, kind Reader, thy pardon then: since 'tis not I Abuse thy patience, but Necessity. 4 I am not I; O no, my I is gone, That precious Self who mighty value gave To worthless Me. What 'tis to be Undone None more profoundly knows than I, who live Torn and in sunder cleft, whilst lost I see That Half which was more than the Whole to me. 5 Sweet Soul how goodly was the Temple which Heav'n pleas'd to make thy earthly Habitation! Built all of graceful Delicacy, rich In Symmetry; and of a dangerous fashion For youthful eyes, had not the Saint within Govern'd the Charms of her inamoring Shrine. 6 How happily compendious didst Thou make My study when I was the Lines to draw Of genuine Beauty! never put to take Long journies was my fancy; still I saw At home my Copy, and I knew 'twould be But Beauty's wrong further to seek than Thee. 7 Full little knew the World (for I as yet In studied silence hugg'd my secret Bliss,) How facil was my Muse's task, when set Virtue's and Grace's features to express! For whilst accomplish'd Thou wert in my sight I nothing had to do, but Look and Write. 8 How sadly parted are those words; since I Must now be Writing, but no more can Look! Yet in my Heart thy precious Memory So deep is grav'd, that from this faithful Book Truly transcrib'd, thy Character shall shine; Nor shall thy Death devour what was divine. 9 Hear then, O all soft-hearted Turtles, hear What you alone profoundly will resent: A Bird of your pure feather 'tis, whom here Her desolate Mate remaineth to lament, Whilst She is flown to meet her dearer Love, And sing among the winged Quire above. 10 Twelve times the glorious Sovereign of Day Had made his progress, and in every Inn Whose golden Signs through all his radiant way So high are hung, as often lodged been; Since in the sacred Knot this noble She Deign'd to be ty'd to (then how happy) me. 11 Ty'd, ty'd we were so intimately, that We strait were sweetly lost in one another. Thus when two Notes in Musick's wedlock knit They in one Concord blended are together: For nothing now our life but musick was, Her Soul the Treble made, and mine, the Base. 12 How at the needless Question would she smile When ask'd, what she desir'd or counted fit? Still bidding me examine mine own will, And read the surest answer ready writ. So center'd was her heart in mine, that She Would own no wish if first not wish'd by Me. 13 Delight was no such thing to her; if I Relish'd it not: the Palate of her Pleasure Carefully watch'd what mine could taste, and by That standard her content resolv'd to measure. By this rare art of sweetness did she prove That though she joy'd, yet all her Joy was Love. 14 So was her Grief: for wrong'd her self she held If I were sad alone; her share, alas, And more than so, in all my Sorrow's field She duly reap'd: and here alone she was Unjust to me. Ah dear injustice, which Mak'st me complain That I was lov'd too much! 15 Yet tenderest she, was no less stiff and stout In Virtue's service: from our nuptial Bed A lovely flower no sooner peeped out, But it into the grave withdrew its head. And let it go; the Method's just, cry'd She, My firstfruits are for Heav'n and not for Me. 16 A second sprouted then; who for a while Flatter'd our Joys; but withering in his bud, Did only them the deeplyer beguile. When lo, my valiant Dear discretely shed Such moderate Tears as testify'd that she Would Mother here and yet not Woman be. 17 To loose the fruit, said she, shall not dismay My heart, so long as it enjoys the Tree: I am content the streams should slip away, Since still the Spring, the Spring, remains with me; Whilst I th'Original at large possess, Of two small Copies little is the loss. 18 What wonder now that Heav'n was pleased this Twice-tryed Patience doubly to requite; And for one Pair it snatch'd away, to bliss Her afterward with two, on whom she might Transcribe her virtuous self, and make them be Her Soul's as well's her Body's Progeny. 19 And to this welcome task betimes she fell, Moulding the soft and tender Wax; on which Of Discipline she clapt the early seal, That it not Art might seem, but Nature: such Was her Indulgencie's sagacity That on the future still she kept her Eye. 20 Her tender Twigs, whilst fitted any way To bend, she wisely bended to the best; And this was Upward, that thus thriving They Might grow to Heav'n. How oft has she profest 'Twas not th'ambition of her prime endeavour To have them live, but have them live for ever. 21 Nor could her Servants scape her pious care, Whom she more truly serv'd than they did Her, Watching to keep them in religious fear And in the bounds of sober Order: for Unless their God they learn to serve, said she, How can they faithful service do to me? 22 But o'r her self her watch was most severe, Jealous of nothing more than of her heart. Her richest Virtues, which admired were By others' eyes, her own suspected: Art, Art still she fear'd, and right profoundly wise Judg'd artificial Virtue real Vice. 23 And this such deep and bitter quarrels bred Between her Soul and Her, that often I Ran in to part the fray, and help her read The Error of her Zeal: and though she by Mine eyes resolved were to see, yet ne'r So lothly kept She that resolve as here. 24 For in her self meek She so much below Her self was sunk, that all her high Deserts From her own prospect vanished; and though Those Graces which imbellish'd others' hearts Were to her reverent observation known, Her own were not, because they were her own. 25 To Heav'nward open'd She her morning eyes, And darted her Devotion's preface thither: Before she rose, thus did she duly rise; And then gat up, and call'd her thoughts together, Her Matin's sacrifice to kindle; for All Offrings but by fire did she abhor. 26 Then for her morning's Draught, unto the spring Of life and bliss, the Book of books, she flew; Which her with various Nectar furnishing, Sometimes she quaff'd the Old, sometimes the New: And knew both Tastes so fully, that 'twas clear The New at length was not the New to her. 27 All David fairly she transcribed on The tables of her faithful Memory; There likewise wrote she Soul-inamoring John; Nor e'r was more exact Orthography. That from Love's Laws her Soul might never start, She thus had Piety it self by heart. 28 But that her time might in the Chanel run Of pure Devotion, she for every day Cut out her holy work, by which alone She knew how Weeks both came and went away. Right Christian Account, which thus could make Her dearest Jesus be her Almanack. 29 For by the Wonders of His Love did she Distinguish all the Week: She first descended With Him from Heav'n, and His Humility Traced to Bethlehem; where she attended His simple Cratch, and learn'd those Pomps to scorn In which true Glory's Prince would not be born. 30 The next Day led her to that Desert where Grapling with Hunger and with Satan, she Beheld her Lord. The Third invited her To meditate His scorn and Injury When by His Scholar at a sordid price Sold and betray'd to bloody Enemies. 31 Her thoughts were highly entertained by The fourth at that dear Board of purest Bliss, Which Jesus furnish'd with the Mystery Of His own Blood's and Bodie's Sacrifice. Deep in her heart, upon the fifth she strove To print the sacred Wounds and Death of Love. 32 The Sixth, as duly found her at His Grave Embalming Him with sweet Devotion's spice. But on the Seventh, His Resurrection gave Her cheerlyest Contemplation leave to rise; Nor could the Clouds convey Him from its view, For after His Ascension too she flew. 33 And by this bless'd hebdomadary Round (The Heav'nly Orb which she on Earth contriv'd) Weaned from our Worldly motions, she found Her circled self in solid Rest, and liv'd Above that Cheat which makes fond Mortals prize For true Content, heart-vexing Vanities. 34 Her Soul resolv'd to keep its home within, And not dwell fluttering in her outward Tire: Her Rule was, what was fit, not, what was fine; Not to be sold, but cloth'd, was her desire. Miscall it not; it is, said she to me No Suit, unless it suits with my Degree. 35 Preposterousness she counted it, to wear Her purse upon her back: yet with no less Abhorrence look'd she on that sordid Care Which blush'd not to appear in open Dress. Right prudently she cut her way between, Approving nothing Golden, but the mean. 36 She ne'r took post to keep an equal pace Still with the newest Modes, which swiftly run: She never was perplex'd to hear her Lace Accus'd for six months old, when first put on: She laid no watchful Leigers, costly-vain Intelligence with fashions to maintain. 37 On a Pin's point she ne'r held consultation, Nor at her Glass's strict tribunal brought Each Pleit to scrupulous examination: Asham'd she was that Titan's coach about Half Heav'n should sooner wheel, than she could pass Through all the petty stages of her Dress. 38 No gadding Itch e'r spurr'd her to delight In needless Sallies; none but civil care Of friendly correspondence could invite Her out of doors; unless she pointed were By Visitations from Heav'n's hand, where she Might make her own in tender sympathy. 39 Abroad, she counted but her Prison: Home, Home was the region of her Liberty. Abroad Diversion throng'd, and left no room For Zeal's set task, and virtue's bus'ness free: Home was her less incumbred Scene, though there Angels and God she knew Spectators were. 40 Yet this Retirement's cloud ne'r overcast Those beams of leggiadrous Courtesy Which smil'd in her Deportment; and exprest Full confutation of their Calumny, Who lumpish, sullen, and the source of all Affected Soureness, strict Devotion call. 41 Nor was this sweetness partial, and design'd In complemental Gracefulness to vy; But full as facil to the plainest Hind As to the courtlyest Gallant: Poverty She ne'r could count a reason of neglect, Who did so oft on Bethlehem Cratch reflect. 42 This made her trade with such sincere delight In frequent Alms: her self she satisfy'd When she the Needy fill'd; and that she might As ready be as was their want, she ty'd Her self to spare a weekly sum, and be Provided of a Bank of Charity. 43 Nor did her sympathetick Soul with less Tenderness yearn the publick Woes to see, When bolster'd up with long-abus'd Success Sedition, Rapin, Murder, Perjury, Schism, Heresy, Rebellion, Usurpation Reign'd on the stage of this distracted Nation. 44 But when the monstrous Tempest tam'd she saw To Peace's Calm; when glorious Charles ascended His rightful throne, restoring both the Law Of Earth and Heav'n; when Truth no more was branded For Superstition; when the Church had to The Temple liberty again to go: 45 Such was her Joy, as if the total Bliss Had been her own: for by the common Good, On her Particular she set the price; And not contented with the vulgar Mode, Besides what flaming at her gate she had, True Triumph's Bonfire in her heart she made. 46 Yet sadly cool'd that Fervor was, when she Observ'd how those who deeplyest were ingaged To flie the Crimes whose importunity Had lately Vengeance rous'd, and Heav'n enraged, Back to their Vomit turn'd, as if their Peace Had only come to let them Sin at ease. 47 How did she sigh! to see fantastick Pride, Restless Ambition, studied Luxury, All in a fresh carreer eagerly ride; Forgeting quite that injur'd Lenity To Fury boils; that Justice, when constrain'd, New Covenants and new Presbiters can find. 48 Oft did she chew this heavy Meditation, Crying, Are these the thanks and praise we pay To Him who from the jaws of Desolation Snatch'd us! did He the Rebels' powers destroy To make free room for our Contempt to swell And shamelesly against Himself rebel! 49 This wean'd her weary heart from things below, And kindled it with strong desire to gain Her Hopes' high Aim. Life could no longer now Flatter her love, or make her prayers refrain From begging (yet with humble resignation) To be dismissed from her mortal station. 50 Long in this earnest fervour did she fry, Until a Fever's mighty flame begun To cool it, and incourage her with high Expectance that she had not far to run Before her tedious Race would ended be In never-ending Rest's felicity. 51 O how she welcomed her courteous Pain, And languished with most serene Content! No Paroxysms could make her once complain, Nor suffer'd she her Patience to be spent Before her Life; contriving thus to yield To her disease, and yet not loose the field. 52 This trying furnace wasted day by day (What she her self had always counted Dross,) Her mortal Mansion, which so ruin'd lay That of the goodly fabrick nothing was Remaining now but skin and bone; refin'd Together were her Body and her Mind, 53 At length the final hour (sad hour to me!) Releas'd the longing Soul: no Ejulation Tolled her knell; no dying Agony Frown'd in her death; but in that lamb-like fashion In which she liv'd (O righteous Heav'n, said I Who clos'd her dear eyes,) she had leave to die. 54 She dy'd; but to that Life's possession flew In hopes of which alone before she lived. Alas, I only perish'd, who in shew Was left alive; and she who dy'd, survived. None, none this woful Riddle feels but I; Hers was the Death, but mine the Tragedy. 55 O ever-precious Soul, yet shall that flight Of thine, not snatch thee from thy wonted Nest: Here shalt thou dwell, here shalt thou live in spight Of any death, here in this faithful Breast. Unworthy 'tis, I know, by being Mine; Yet nothing less, since long it has been Thine. 56 Accept thy dearer Pourtraiture, which I Have on my other Psyche fixed here; Since her ideal Beauties signify The truth of thine: as for her spots, they are Thy useful foil, and shall inservient be But to inhance and more illustrate Thee. 57 Pseudagius, whose fairfaced Piety Possession of the Virgin's heart had won, Now fully feasts his hungry Tyranny Upon his tender yielding Prey; and soon Instils his Poisons with such holy art That their contagion rul'd in every part. 58 Both in the Suburbs of her Soul, and in The Capitol she found it domineer; And quickly grown completely Nazaren, She fondly joy'd that slavish yoke to wear; Esteeming it to be his gentle Lore Whom as her only Lord she did adore. 59 Satan, who lurk'd in ambush to espy His slie Designs' effect; triumph'd to see That Psyche by this moderate Heresy Was so extreamly charm'd: for crafty He When but a little Leven had crept in, The whole Lump's body oft had tainted seen. 60 He knew a petty Gap might quickly turn A mighty Chasme: he knew one Spark might thrive Into a fulgrown Flame, and serve to burn The strongest Fort: he knew one Wheel might drive A thousand more: he knew a careless Slip Might cause a Fall, as well's a wilful Skip. 61 He knew that they who once a foot had set In Error's labyrinth, would easily be Allured further to proceed in it By their own tickling Curiosity; And having turn'd from Truth's meridian light, Might soon inamored be of blackest Night. 62 Yet to secure his Plot, he Logos fill'd With greater Pride and Confidence, since he Saw Thelema and Psyche forc'd to yield At last, to what he did at first agree; And they abashed with unhappy shame His domineering carriage durst not blame. 63 By this unbrideled Impudence he grew So vainly bigger than himself, that he Presum'd far more than all the World he knew In Truth's judicious discovery. Thus foolish Dreamers think they view the skies When dusky Sleep has sealed up their eyes. 64 O miserable Soul, whose Blindness is The argument by which she thinks her Sight Acute and pure! who, 'cause she once did miss, Her way, is confident of going right! Who on her Fall doth build her Arrogance, And counts her Knowledge by her Ignorance. 65 For when the Morn call'd early Psyche out, And led her to the sacred Sepulchre; Full in her way the watchful Tempter brought One who no common Mortal's aspect wore: Grave was his garb, but graver far his look: And him for some deep-learned Man she took. 66 Capricious Logos could not rest content Till he had sounded what the Man could say: Big with a spruce and eloquent Complement, He brings it forth and strews it in his way, And bowed to the ground with it: which done, Agyrtes stay'd, and Logos thus went on: 67 Sir, if your Soul be to your Body true It must be Science's vast Treasury; And those spiritual Riches never knew What Loss or Diminution meant, when by Ingenuous Impartment they were sown In other's breasts, yet not plucked from their own. 68 For though his radiant Largise on the Moon, And every Star, and all the World besides He poureth out; yet still the copious Sun On in his undiminish'd Glory rides. Though thousand Brooks it grudges not to fill, The teeming Fountain lives in fulness still. 69 A portion of your Streams, and of your Light, Which by this spending are the more to you Increas'd, is that we beg: Our stupid Night To knowing Day may by your Influence grow: Our arid barren Intellect may be By your Effusions taught Fertility. 70 That natural Desire which did inflame Your Industry to reach at Knowledge, is Common to Us; nor will your Wisdom blame Our free and bold Obedience to this Potent Instinct, by following which have You Attain'd that Blessing which we sue for now. 71 So Logos spake; and bowing down again Press'd his Petition by his fauning gesture: Nor could his ceremonious Lips refrain, But kiss'd the margin of the Stranger's vesture; Thus craving with his closed mouth, and wooing With all his courtlyest Art his own Vndoing. 72 When by a gravely graceful Pause the Man More reverence had won, with friendly eye He first their Welcome look'd; then thus began To speak it: though safe silence suits with my Devout Profession, more than Words, yet now To Courtesie's strong Law my tongue must bow. 73 If I to Strangers should not Kindness show I should affront that Lord who owned me A Stranger to himself. Yet must you know That I pretend not by my industry To have acquir'd that mystick wealth in which Your not mistaking fancy counts me rich. 74 Alas, Agyrtes had as sottish been As is the heavyest He that sees the light, Had Heav'n's sweet Rays not pleas'd to intervene Between my heart and Ignorance's Night. But Jesus, who is King of Love as well As Wisdom, deign'd with both my breast to fill. 75 Yet this no Wisdom is but only what Concerns his Truth and Him: if therefore you For any other Learning thirst but that, Pray seek where Vanity and Error grow. That that, or none, sweet Sir, said Psyche; We Would only in Heav'n's Wisdom learned be. 76 This yielding Answer made him smile within, And promise his proud heart the Victory: Yet sure to make, and grace his holy Sin, To heav'n he turn'd his hell-directed Eye; And lifting up his hands, seem'd thence to take The copy of what next he meant to speak. 77 Then on the ready grass, which offer'd there Its gentle service, jointly sitting down; Although said he, you yet but Strangers are, Your holy Wish thus far has made you known That I perceive you are not yet to be Inform'd, there is a Christ and Piety. 78 But as the noblest things besieged are With thornyest difficulties, so is this Religion and Truth yet never were Enthron'd so high, but saucy Wickedness Would muster as aspiring Errors, and Before their face in flat defiance stand. 79 Yet if a Candidate you ever were In great Cerinthus's School, what need I now Open my bottles to your thirst, who there All fulness from the Fount were taught to draw? My School, cry'd Psyche, gentle Sir, alas Only in blind and barbarous Albion was. 80 Know then, that when kind Heav'n implanted had (Replyed he) its Gospel here below: Ten thousand Weeds a conjuration made To choke it when it first began to grow: The Blade no sooner peeped forth, but there These pois'nous Tyrants strove to domineer. 81 And surely all the harvest Hopes had been Slain in their birth, had Jesus's watchful Care Into his Field not sent Cerinthus: Sin Ev'n in the spring presum'd the Crop to shear; And Truth her infant head sought where to hide; So rampant Error was, and spread so wide. 82 But this sage Gardner with his timely hook Cut those Intruders down, and clear'd the ground. The Church's soil strait cheer'd its doleful Look, And rescu'd Truth, full room to flourish found. The mystick Paradise began to be From all th'insidious Serpent's dangers free. 83 The reverend Law, whose flaming Majesty Flashed from Sinai, now brake out again; And chasing all licentious Mists, which by Heretick Sloth had gain'd Religion's rein, Mingled its Lustre with the Gospel's Ray, And doubled beauteous Truth's unspotted Day. 84 And wonder not if that severity Which could not but attend this Reformation, Gall'd Error's soul, and made Cerinthus be The Butt of all despightful Indignation; Since gallant He durst check the World, and ride Against ev'n Catholick Corruption's tide. 85 Blind Ignorance was grown so bold, that she Would needs perswade the World it had no Eyes; Making the lazy name of Mystery In stead of Demonstration suffice, From this black Pit those Prodigies of blear Hoodwink'd abused Faith vomited were. 86 For who can fancy Heav'n would e'r obtrude On reasonable Souls such shameless Fictions As full against all Reason's Rules conclude, And founded are on jarring Contradictions! Sure God so strange a Law did never give, That Men must not be Men if they believe. 87 No; 'twas not God's, but Man's most lawless Law, Who by enacting it usurped more Than Godlike Power on those he won to bow Their superstitious Necks to this new Lore; By which to brutish Sotishness they are Enslav'd, who Free by Christian Title were. 88 'Tis not enough, forsooth, that we believe Mary the Mother was to Jesus; but Into the bargain needs we must receive That she a Virgin still remain'd. And what More likely Proof, than her Virginity The truth of His blest Birth to nullify? 89 If she a Mother be, she must be so; But if a Virgin, she a Virgin is. He that in One ties these repugnant Two, May reconcile the Poles into a Kiss, May Midnight in the face of Highnoon throw, May cement in one Center, ay and No. 90 But by this Trick such Forgers pave a way How their new Doctrines may embraced be For most unspotted virgin Truths, though they Prove Mothers of a numerous Progeny: A Progeny of canonized Fictions, Religious Lyes, and reverend Contradictions. 91 Yet well it were, had Mary been alone The subject of this holy Nonsense: but With greater impudence upon her Son It ventur'd, and madly forging what Unbias'd Reason cannot but detest, This as the sacred Rule of Faith profest. 92 For though the Marveilmongers grant that He Was moulded up but of a mortal metal, And that his Substance was the same which We Find in our selves so sadly weak and brittle; Yet an eternal God they make him too, And angry are that We will not do so. 93 (The idle Madness of a dreaming Brain Thus counts one thing a Mountain and a Mite; Fancies the Sun, Light's royal Sovereign, To look like swarthy and ignoble Night; Imagins wretched Worms, although it see Them crawl in dirt, illustrious Kings to be.) 94 But Heav'n forbid our Tongues should so blaspheme, And call our God as poor a thing as We. How can Eternity be born in Time! How can Infinitude a Baby be! Or how can Heav'n and Earth's Almighty Lord To Egypt fly for fear of Herod's sword! 95 How can the Spring of Wisdom wiser grow! How can the most immeasurable Nature By bounded years assistance from a low And childish pitch, rise to a manly Stature! How more than sottish is that Forgery, That He should higher wax, who is Most High! 96 Can He be hungry who doth all things feed? Can boundless Joy's eternal Monarch weep? An Angel's help can Angel's Maker need? Is He all Eye, and yet can fall asleep? Can Man the Prince of Power crucify? Can He, life's everlasting Fountain, die? 97 Such Gods as these indeed were Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Neptune, Mercury, Appolo, And all that Rout to whom blind Pagans rear Their cursed Altars: and must Christians follow Such goodly Leaders, and their copy take Religion worse than Atheism to make! 98 Surely much thank their Maker ows to them Whose glorious Faith hath been so studious to Heap all those vile Indignities on Him Which they themselves abhor to undergo. If God be such a wretched Thing, no more Will I (and 'tis no proud word) Him adore. 99 But He is as impassible as they Would make Him weak and faint: nor can He bow To yield His high almighty Self a Prey To our Infirmities who crawl below. His superglorious most refined Nature As far from Suffring is, as from a Creature. 100 I know they strive to mince the Matter by Distinguishing His Natures; for their Art (Resolv'd to blush at no Absurdity,) Doubts not Himself ev'n from Himself to part. Yet durst not We admit a Deity Which must upon Distinctions builded be. 101 First let them prove that Contraries are one, And that Immensity can bounded be: That Height and Depth can friendly meet, and run Into one Center's common Unity: That Truth is double: that one Person can Be Adam's genuine Son, yet more than Man. 102 But O how madly mad their Doctrine is, And how transcending Pagan Blasphemy, Who not content to make a God of this Both passible and mortal Jesus: try To thrust Him into one substantial Knot With an eternal Sire who Him begot! 103 Two, yet not Two, but One these Two must be; Nay and a Third into the Knot must cling: The Spirit in they twist to make up Three: Yet vouch these Three for but One single thing; Thus fast and loose they play, or ev'n and odd, And we a juggling Trick must have for God. 104 If God be one; then let Him be so still: Why jumble We we know not what together? Discerned not the World their God, until This old blind Age discovered Him? Did neither The Patriarks believe, nor Seers see Aright, because they took not One for Three? 105 I and my Brethren are full well content Ne'r to aspire to other Paradise Than that to which those holy Heroes went Whose Faith knew no such curious Prodigies. No; Faith's a grave and sober Maid: and she Loves neither Quirk nor Trick nor Forgery. 106 Let love and duty make of Christ as high And glorious a Thing as Wit can reach; Provided that against the Deity No sacrilegious injury they preach. If He that only way may honored be, Him to neglect is Piety, say We. 107 But we neglect Him not, who merits more Of us, than all our Reverence can pay: Our necks we yield to His most gentle Lore, And His Commands ambitiously obey. His royal Law, is Love; and hated be They who love not so sweet a Lord as He. 108 For our parts, we can willingly defy Whatever dares our Love to Him oppose; No Persecution frights our Loyalty, Nor durst we think those lives are lost we loose In His dear quarrel, who by Dying hath Op'd us a way to Life through any Death. 109 You see how freely our Profession we Impart to Strangers; being confident That honest Truth can never shamed be. Yet whither you will bow down your Consent To our meek Doctrines, since I doubtful am, Expect not I should further lavish them. 110 For if your Faith relies on Men, who are Themselves but founded upon mouldering Dust; If you by Reason's rule disdain to square Your Piety, and take your God on trust, (Which Heav'n forbid!) you only are a Prize To foul Imposters' fairtongu'd Fallacies. 111 He ceased here. When Logos louting low His fauning head to Psyche, gave her joy That she had met so grave a Doctor now Whose piercing Judgment's edge could cut the way So plain and clear through those thik fogs which had Religions' region sadly overspread. 112 Err not, said he, your former Error, but Think how unjustly you Authades sleighted. O what substantial Arguments, and what Strong Motives has he muster'd and united In this concise Discourse, whose depth might well Be owned by the holyest Oracle. 113 Psyche, whose shier heart not long ago Would have abhor'd this venomous Language more Than doth the Lamb the Wolf's or Lyon's, who Nothing but barbarous slaughter to it roar; Had now forgot her pious jealous fear, And knew not what it meant to be aware. 114 She from the Nazaren Cup already had Sipped some drops of Bane; which having won Her fond heart's approbation, it made An open chanel for full streams to run Into her bosom. Thus an Army by One little breach pours in its Victory. 115 Nay though a strange reluctant Tremor through Her bones did glide, she would not hearken what That secret Item whispered, nor know What dangerous Knowledge she affected; but With monstrous Weakness conquers her own Might And to her fatal Wo yields with delight. 116 She yields to swallow this Cerinthian Bait, And studies to her Murderer thanks to pay. Dear Sir, said she, your solid Reason's weight Doth on my heart such sound Persuasion lay That needs it must submit, and henceforth learn Your further Favour thankfully to earn. 117 Scarce had she spoke; when lo, her Doctor, who Had spy'd her Guardian flying thither, took His leave as handsomly as haste and wo Would him permit. Alas the Angel's look Frighted the Cheater, who suspicious was That Phylax would his holy Fraud uncase. 118 But as away he sneaked; Psyche's friend Hot in th'impatience of loving Wrath, The whining air with sprightful wings did rend And shot himself through the directest path To reach his Charge; for whom his heart did quake, Because her own, though ruin'd, would not shake. 119 For by Love's Faithful Sympathy (though He About his other work far distant were,) He still preserv'd a soft Vicinity With Psyche's Soul, and felt each wound: which there Sophistick Darts had made, though foolish she Perceived not her sugar'd misery. 120 At his approach, for joy the Virgin wept, Not thinking that those tears to Shame were due: For still Syneidesis securely slept, And to her heart forbore her heart to shew. She to her Self was more a Stranger, than The Tarter to the Æetheopian. 121 But Phylax, almost out of breath for haste, Suck'd in fresh spirits, and strictly then demanded Who 'twas that gather'd up his heels so fast, And fled from his arrival? if offended He at my presence were, 'tis meet that I Said he, suspect him for your Enemy. 122 No sure, replyed she; for neither I, Nor Logos, could discover ought but love. He freely taught us many a Verity, And what he undertook, did clearly prove. Misconster not his haste; 'twas no Offense At you, but sudden bus'ness snatch'd him hence. 123 But Phylax better knowing him, than She, The total matter gently sifted out; And wrought upon her Softness so, that He His kind Design right subtly brought about: For full confession from her charmed tongue Of both her Doctors' Principles he wrung. 124 Which heard; he groan'd, and smote his pitying breast, And fixed upon hers his speaking eye; By which the mixed language he exprest Of love and wrath, of hope and jealousy: And in this Prologue setting ope the door, He from his lips his troubled Mind did pour, 125 Left I my Charge, O Psyche, to the Wind When hence I took my journey, or to Thee? If in my dearest cabinet, thy Mind, I my Advice deposed, could it be That every Cheater's breath should open lay Thy breast, and blow that solid Pawn away? 126 If ever yet I fail'd to justify My tenderest Affection's truth to thee; Thou thence mightst patch up some Apology Wherewith to cloke thy proving False to me. But see what Logick thou hast learnt of late, Who mak'st Love's Premisses conclude in Hate. 127 'T had been but fair, if thou hadst staid to hear What I against those Arguments could say, Whose Charms have stoll'n thy Faith out at thine ear. But Phylax was not worth Expecting; nay Not worth Remembring; else how could thy lip Seal'd up by mine, Cerinthus's kisses sip! 128 My heart misgave me when away I went, Or rather when with thine I left it here: Ask but thy self what earnest pains I spent To arm thy tender Soul with sacred fear. O why with foolish confidence wouldst thou Disarm thy self, and make room for the Blow? 129 That Blow, which struck so deep into thy breast That if some sovereign Balsam makes not speed; If strait thy Wounds be not as deeply drest; If Heav'n be not as quick new life to shed Into thy Soul, as Hell was to betray It unto death; this is thy fatal Day. 130 Alas those Doctrines only Poisons were, Squeez'd from the dregs of Satan's direful Pit. Less pestilential those Venoms are Which desperate Basilisks and Vipers spit. Nor Aphrodisus's, nor Agenor's tongue With such sure Bane thy careless bosom stung. 131 And canst thou Psyche, thus requite thy Lord For all the treasures of His Love which He So freely into thy poor heart hath pour'd? What? plainly rob Him of his Deity, And tear Him from his throne, whilst royal He His heav'nly Realm prepares for worthless Thee? 132 Brisk Logos here no longer patience had; For pricking up his insolent crest, he cry'd, Good Sir, and take you me for one so mad That in my proper road I cannot ride; But both my Self, and Way, so wildely loose, And willingly deep Precipices choose? 133 If Eyes of Colours sober judges be, If Tongues can censure what is sour and sweet, If Ears can Discords know from Harmony, If Touching may decide in Cold and Heat; Why may not I, who sit in Reason's chair, Presume to judge what Proofs convincing are? 134 Unless I to my Essence give the Lye, These Doctrines builded are on Demonstration. But if you only must be Psyche's Eye; Ev'n pull me out, that by no perturbation The progress of your Plots I may forestal: Pray let me be my Self, or not at all. 135 Psyche was glad to hear this Challenge beat So high, and hop'd that Phylax would relent. And were Angelick love's heroick Heat Less resolute than it is, just Discontent Had quenched Phylax's flames, which braved now By this bold Opposition stouter grew. 136 For from her heav'n with secret instance He Drew Charis down, to join her Powers with his. Strait viewing Psyche's wounded bosom, she Melted with pity at her deep distress; And by victorious Sweetness op'd a way Into her heart, and Thelema made her prey. 137 For with all heav'nly Operations, Speed Contempor'd is; that in the quick Effect The dullest Eye apparently may read Omnipotence's dint. Thus Charis checkt Stout Thelema, and in a moment prest Her to a Willingness not to Resist. 138 Which Phylax marking: Logos strives in vain, Said he, to countermine my care of thee, I these Affronts, and greater, can sustain Rather than Psyche should destroyed be; All this, and more, I will forget, so thou Wilt see one Spectacle I have to show. 139 Logos look'd big, and strugled might and main; But Thelema was tractable and tame, And vow'd the sullen Rebel to constrain Unto her pliant mind his own to frame. Poor Psyche sigh'd and wept, and half afraid, Phylax with her to do his pleasure pray'd. 140 He weighing well that her Disease had need Of nothing more than Haste in her Physitian; Stay'd not to parle, but made all loving speed To snatch her from these jaws of deep Perdition; Whilst yet with Charis's soulsubduing heat Her melted and convicted heart did beat. 141 Ready at hand his welknown Chariot stood, In which he takes her up; and shakes the rein: Forthwith the sprightful Steeds tearing the road Which open lay upon th'ethereal plain, Soon reached Gitton in Samaria; where Phylax as quickly curbed their carreer. 142 Then lighting down, Lo Psyche, this, said he, Is those thy newfound Doctor's native Town; Here thou their true Original shalt see, And from what kind of Nest they all are flown. This House their Father's was: Come, let us in, And view the Birthplace of Heretick Sin. 143 Thus entred they: when in the house they find Such swarms of Doors, and Cells, and Galleries, Which by quaint Turnings to and fro did wind, That Psyche quickly lost her rolling eyes; As she had done her Self, had Phylax not Of all the Labyrinth full knowledge got. 144 But through a thousand snarl'd Meanders, to A goodly Room he soon conducted her; Where she another Door espy'd, but no Cause to suspect what Dens in ambush were Lurking behind it; so alluring was The holy beauty of its cheating face. 145 A goodly Crucifix was there displaid, Altars were rear'd, and reverend Bibles ope, By which majestick Liturgies were laid, And lofty-tuned Anthems; on the top Art plac'd a Quire of Angels hovering, And made the gorgeous Roof all seem to sing. 146 Truth's best Dissembler, old Apelles heir Had quickned those dead Walls, and made them live In many a holy History; whose fair And breathing Colours did such welcome give, That all Spectators' hearts leap'd to their eyes To feast, though but on painted Rarities. 147 There Faith appeared with her eagle's Eye, Hope with both hands her Anchor clasping fast, And with wide-open bosom Charity; Whose looks with such beseeming beams were drest, That those who thoroughly scann'd them not, might deem She at heav'n's genuine fire had kindled them. 148 With these were ranked Zeal, Austerity, Devotion, Meekness, Gentleness, Content; And whatsoe'r might advantageous be The brave Imposture wisely to present. Baits which might easly work a greater feat Than Psyche's soft Simplicity to cheat. 149 She gaz'd, and copied in her foolish heart With Fancie's pencil, what her Wonder saw. But sober Phylax, whom no Painter's art Could into rash (because blind) Error draw, As easily return'd his Pupil back As she had slipt into her fond Mistake. 150 What credit thou to those fair Looks may'st give, Said he, thou shalt behold when I have shown What ugliness those beauteous Porters strive To palliate. With that, he bent his Frown Upon th'inchanting Hypocrites, and they To his imperious Anger strait gave way. 151 The holy Pageantry it self confest, And yielded into naked Truth; for what Before, the life of Goodliness exprest, Repented now into its native Blot: No quintessence of ink, or soot, or pitch, The blackness of that Chamber's walls might reach. 152 Nor could the Door sustain his piercing Look, But started into shivers: when, behold, An hideous Grot, belching out stink and smoke, A cloud of Terror upon Psyche roll'd; In which her groping thoughts were lost, and she Quite buried in blind Perplexity. 153 But Phylax shot from his illustrious Eye Such potent lightning as subdu'd that cloud; When lo about the Cavern's sides a Fry Of frighted Toads into their holes did croud; And thousand Spiders, at the sight agast, Into the centers of their webs made haste. 154 But O what Man's, or Muse's tongue can tell The other Monsters which were hissing there! Huge Snakes, preposterous Amphisbænas fell, And fiery Basilisks discover'd were With angry Hydras, Scorpions, Dragons, and Of foul Chimæras many a marshall'd band. 155 Yet these all fled before the Angel's face, And in their several dens loud howling lay: But he intending for a further place With these less monstrous Monsters made no stay: Strait to a closer darker door he goes, Things far more deadly pois'nous to disclose. 156 Glozing Deceits, and handsom Lyes stood there, With gentle meek demure Hypocrisy; All which in goodly state attended were By treacherous Rhetorick and Phylosophy; With Syllogisms in rank and file array'd Whose hands three-forked massy halberts sway'd. 157 But dreadfully abashed, on the ground All these before the hasting Angel fell; Who entring by that damned Portal, found To such a Porch a correspondent Hall. The Stinks he met before, pure Odours were To these which reek'd in every corner here. 158 The Master of the house, grim Simon, who Wore Magus for his cussed sirname, sate Full in the midst; whose pois'ned stomack so Surcharged was with crude Opinions, that Its pestilential Load, which belk'd and wrought, Into a brazen bowl, he spewed out. 159 And this that indigested Chaos was Wherein all Heresies did jumbled lie; The fertile Womb which fostered the Mass Of every kind of breeding Blasphemy; The Seed and Matter whence Sin's foul Creator Of all black hideous Fancies fram'd the feature. 160 As this dire Vomit smoked in the bowl, A croud of desperate Men throng'd round about; Whose most accursed Thirst betray'd their soul To covet this black draught. No scalding drought Of chased Harts e'r bred such strong desire In cooling springs to quench their raging fire. 161 The first Sup bold Menander got, and by, That cankering liquor so infected grew That Simon he outspit in Heresy, And higher than his spewing Father flew. Much he disdain'd that God or Man should be However noble, nobler thought than He. 162 Cerinthus next to lapping fell, and then His hungry Younglings with the Venom fed; 'Mongst whom Agyrtes suck'd his part: whom when Psyche beheld, Guilt dy'd her cheeks with red. But Ebion thrusting in took off her eye: He Scripture's Mangler, Fo of Chastity. 163 Yet Nicholas madder prov'd himself than He, And drunk so deep, that of all learned Lust He turn'd Professor, and attain'd to be The Hate of God. Behind him Elxai thrust, And foul Jexeus, bretheren no less In Nature than in lustful Putidness. 164 Then Saturnine, whose draught so strangely wrought, That Purity it self he judg'd impure; Chaste Matrimony he abhorr'd as fraught With shameful odiousness; nor would endure That any creature's blood his lips should stain, Though they all humane lawful Births had slain. 165 Then Basilides, from this loathsome fount Like dangerous Poison drunk: right pure and clean Uncleanness seem'd in his corrupt account. Nor had this Liquor different relish in Carpocrates his mouth, and Valentin's, The Oracles of all libidinous Sins. 166 From these dire Parents flow'd that numerous spawn Of most portentuous Gnosticks, Antilacks, Zacchæans, Coddians, Ophites, Cainites; known By their profession of such shameless facts As Hell would blush at: yet these facts were those Which they for proofs of pure Religion chose. 167 Next these, about the bowl's brim licking lay The Nazarens: amongst whose sneaking fry Were both Anthades and Pseudagius, they Who tainted Psyche's heart with Heresy. She saw them there, and stood amaz'd to see Saint-seeming Souls in deep-damn'd Company. 168 Her woful indignation on her breast She sealed with a loud and hearty stroak; And having thus her venturous Crime confest Under her own hand, into tears she broke. But Phylax charg'd her to observe the rest Who forward to Death's living fountain prest. 169 For after those, appear'd the Marcosites, Epiphanes, Secundus, Isidore; Bold Cerdonists, and fond Heracleonites; Marcion, Apelles; with blasphemous store Of their Disciples: Lucan, Lucian, Photinus, Basiliscus, Hermogen. 170 Then proud Montanus; with Quintilians, Ascites, Pepuzians, and Artotyrites, Priscillians, pharisaik Tatians, Abstemious yet profane Severianites; Archonticks, Adamites, Quartadecimans, Vain Alogists, and Melchisidekians. 171 Tertullianists, Arabicks, Symmachists, Homousiasts, Elxites, Origenians, Valesians, Agrippinians, Catharists, Hydroparastates, Patripassians, Apostolicks, Angelicks, Chiliasts, Samosatenian Paulianists. 172 Mad Maniches, outrageous Donatists, Curs'd Arians, Colluthians, Audianites, Marcellians, and Macedonianists, Aerians, Acacians, Eustathites, Eunomians, Messalians, Luciferians, Agnoites, Hypsistarists, Apollinarians. 173 Timotheans, Seleucians, Collyridians Rhetorians, Venustians, Proclianites, Foul-mouth'd Jovinianists, and black Helvidians, Bonosians, Campensians, Agapites; Pelagius, Nestorius, Eutyches, Accompany'd with all their Progenies. 174 Innumerable more besides were there Whose several Poisons' Nature Phylax read To his attentive Pupil, though they ne'r As yet were to this world discovered. Yea those he shew'd her, who at length would fill With soul-destroying Bane her native Isle. 175 New-coyned Catharists were they; who bread All Tribes and Kinds of raging Monsters, and By traiterous Heresy upon the head Of trampled Church and State presum'd to stand. Yet these to Him but petty Vermin were Who brandish'd now his vaster terror there. 176 A Prodigy of such commanding Look That all those awed Suckers gave him way: Three times his mighty head and locks he shook, Three times he stoop'd, and seem'd too proud to lay His lips so low; yet bowing down at length, Upon the Bowl he shew'd his cursed strength: 177 For every drop of that foul Vomit he Ingorged strait; and kick'd the Bowl away. When lo the Venom's rampant potency Made all the desperate Man its frightful Prey. In's staring eyes, and all about his face Infernal Horror freely took its place. 178 Two ragged horns brake from his brazen brow, From's sulphury mouth impatient Blasphemy; Big with all rancorous Spight his bosom grew; His soul was stretch'd with arrogant Majesty. Nor was't a wonder that he thus did swell, Who quaffed had and drunken was with Hell. 179 He swore, and with a thundering oath, that he Would make the whole World to his pleasure bow. He threatned all Heav'n's starry Bravery Down from their highest strongest Orbs to throw; And vow'd by his own Head, no God should be Thenceforth believed or ador'd but He. 180 Forthwith he proudly bent his brawny fists, And mounted up his more than Dragon's tail; With that artillery entering the lists, And impudently trusting to prevail. Nor was his Insolence in vain, for he From Heav'n it self snatch'd down his victory. 181 From th'Evangelick Heav'n he boldly drew Millions of Souls, whom he in sunder tore Or with his breath's most Murdering Venom slew, Bellowing his triumph in a dismal Roar: Which made th'Heretick Frie terribly quake, Curs'd Simon start, and honest Psyche shake. 182 But to allay the tempest of her fear, Mark, Phylax cry'd, mark but what bounds restrain The Monster's pride; for He's a pris'ner here, And cannot break that adamantine Chain Which Him and all his viperous Company Though at some distance, fast to Hell doth tie. 183 She look'd, and saw her Guardian told her true: She saw the Chain, which led into a Pit Whence thick sulphureous Eructations flew, And boiling Iron fiery terror spit. Aloud she shriek'd, and turn'd about to spy How from that gaping mouth of death to fly. 184 But shelter'd by his Wings' Security, And by his trusty Word incouraged, Into the Grot she ventured her eye; Which there a more prodigeous Object read, Than she had seen imprinted in the book Of hideous Antichrist's portentuous Look. 185 It was that Beldame Hag from whose black breast Simon his rank unweildy Poison drew; Never was Fury so completely drest In all the bravery of Horror's hue: All shapeless shapes together tumbled were To mould up Shame's extremity in Her. 186 Two heads she had, which on her Legs did grow; Two faces, and two mouths, but ne'r an eye; Six rows of teeth, whose task it was to gnaw What of her Carkase they could reach: Her thigh From an eternal Sore did poison drain Into her throat, which spew'd it up again. 187 About her nasty hide the Vermins swarms, Young Adders, Slow-worms, Toads, and Spiders were: Out at her Loins she reach'd her scaley Arms; An hundred Nails on either hand did tear Her dangling Dugs, and when they weary grew, The tatter'd budgets o'r her shoulders threw. 188 High on her neck a twisted Tail did sprout Arm'd with a thousand forked stings, which she For her own torture us'd, and round about Her self its lashes threw: prodigiously Her pois'ned Paunch was swoll'n, and thick beset With snarled throngs of cole-black cloyen feet. 189 These scratch'd and scrambled every way, and drew Her sometimes forward, sometimes back again: If yet this most confounded Monster knew What back and forward meant; for 'twas in vain For any Eye to hope in her to find, What might be term'd Before, and what Behind. 190 As Psyche shiver'd at this baleful sight, And now, said Phylax, do'st not see and feel That Logos's counsel solid was and right, By which sage He engag'd thy heart to dwell In this fine Ladie's family: for she Is Grandame to that hideous Progeny. 191 Since thou hast made this choice, and scorned Me, And my Advice; ev'n take thy chosen place, Or in Pseudagius his company, Or in Agyrtes: nay do not disgrace Thy learned Prudence so as to retract: Judicious Logos will not like the fact. 192 Poor Logos heard this word; which through his heart Such Shame and Sorrow shot, that humbled He Resolved ne'r to trust his proper art Unless with Phylax' mind it did agree. But yet in Psyche's tender breast the Wound More stinging was, more fatally profound. 193 For prostrate at his feet, in silence she Grappled a while with her outrageous Grief: But when she saw the woful Victory Growing upon her, and found no relief In all her soul; she mingles with her sighs Her Deplorations, and thus she cries: 194 Alas, Pseudagius' or Agyrtes' Place, Though sunk in horrors, are too high for me: That dreadful Hag's prodigious embrace Is doubly due to my Apostasy: Deserv'd have wretched I that she should hug Me with her Tail, and feed me with her Dug. 195 For had Pseudagius' or Agyrtes' heart, Like mine, been by a Phylax fortify'd; No Mines, no Onslates of heretick Art Had won their Forts: but I, by sottish Pride Sleiting the Potent help of thy supply, Chose on mine own bold Weakness to rely. 196 I fain would pardon beg; but mighty Shame Seals up my mouth, and Guilt beats back my breath: I fain would invocate His gracious Name Who gave His Life to rescue me from death: But Horror stifles my Attempt, since I Have prov'd a Traytor to His Deity. 197 But thou, sweet Phylax, never did'st displease Our sacred Sovereign, nor force His frown; Seal'd sure on Thee His endless Favour is, And thy Desires He with success will crown; Would'st thou but plead for me, though not for mine, He will for thy dear sake His ear incline. 198 I know my Impudence strains high, who dare Crave thus much favour of abused Thee; But thy brave Charity delights to war Against the most perverse conspiracy Of my Demerits, witness its divine Battle against, Agenor's Pride and Mine. 199 O why shall my ingrateful Error be Able to frustrate thy strong Love's Design! Why may'st thou not be Phylax still to me, And, spight of all my Darkness, freely shine With heav'nly Help! why must Hell's Tyrant bost That Heav'n and You your pains and me have lost! 200 If ever more from thy Advice I start, By bold and traiterous Curiosity, Amidst those Furies may I reap my part Of my already-earned misery; And may thy Wing no more for me be spread, No more thy Tongue for my reprievement plead. 201 Divided here 'twixt trembling hope and fear, On Him she fix'd her lamentable Eye: Urging the rest by Looks; which louder were Than all her former Cries. This modesty A potent charm to her soft Guardian was, Who took her up, and bad her wipe her face. 202 Your holy Resolution hold, said he, And with the Issue trust my love and care: Into false paths you ne'r were lur'd by me Who more discerning eyes than Logos wear. The ways I set may craggy seem, and high; But such lead up to heav'n's sublimity. 203 Here by her hand then tenderly he led, Gathering the steps by which he came into The Grot: the curs'd Inhabitants were glad (Though vex'd withal) that he had pass'd them so. The Serpents creeping from their holes again, Hiss'd after him, and spit their angry pain. CANTO XIX. The Antidote. The ARGUMENT. Psyche, to purge that spreading Taint which had So sliely stoll'n into her cheated breast, By Phylax to Ecclesia's court is led; Where she by Truth's divine embraces blest, Quickly perceiv'd her Cure, and how the heat Of Catholick Health in her sound Pulse did beat. 1 Vain miserable Man, why dost thou tread So proudly on the Worm which crawls below; Forgetting that thine own erected head To far more solid Wretchedness doth bow Than ever made the vilest Reptile be The footstool of Contempt to sirly Thee. 2 Are not the Bowels of Disgrace the Spring Whence thou dost flow? Is not Corruption That despicable Mother which did bring Forth Thee her genuine corruptible Son? Though Flesh and Blood dissemble long, they must Confess at last their putrid mouldring Dust. 3 For in the Center of thy proudest heart Thy fatal Shame thou dost inshrined bear; The Seeds of Rottenness, which pose all Art Of Extirpation, lie breeding there; Which are no sooner to matureness grown, But, with thy self, they must be mowed down. 4 Sage Nature at the moment of thy birth Made thee Lament, when yet thou knew'st not Why; Being with Pollution tumbled headlong forth Into the stage of Life's sure Tragedy; Inevitably there first Vex'd to be, And after murder'd, by Mortality. 5 The meanest Creature that e'r drunk in Light Was richer born, and stronger far than Thou: Completely shiftless was thy native plight, And no self-succour would to thee allow: Naked thou wert of every Help beside, As well's of Clothes, thy woful shame to hide. 6 With Cares, and Fears, in thy young Education Thy troubled Parent travelled again; Her bowels yearn'd with no less perturbation Than when they stretch'd with puerperial pain; It being but Extension of thy Birth To bring thee up, as she had brought thee forth. 7 How worrisomly cross and peevish were Thy feeble years, when thou could'st only fight With thy rebellious Will, and vex the Care Of thy dear Nurse by sullen froward spight! All other Twigs will freely bend: but thou Alone, though young, had'st rather Break than Bow. 8 To school, the Rod both drives, and keeps thee there: Who wholsome Institution dost embrace Not out of Love, but most ignoble fear: Like stubborn Colts, who tutor'd are to pace When dreadful Awe compels them to submit Not to the Rider, but his Whip and Bit. 9 But as the Tinder never fails to catch The smallest spark, though burnt it needs must be By what it hugs: so doth thy Madness snatch At every glistering Sin and Vanity, And grasp it close, although the treacherous Guest Hell-fire most surely kindles in thy breast. 10 When riper years to manly Acts invite Thy well-grown soul, what trade thy strength imploys But that of amorous languishing Delight, Of bitter Sweets, of delicate Annoys, Of fawning Rhymes, of witty Fopperies, Of dainty Perjuries, of smiling Lies? 11 In Ceremonies idely-busy school Thou disciplinest every limb and joint, Until thou grow'st a most accomplish'd Fool In histrionick Vanities: each Point Of finess thou disput'st, and wilt not Look, Or move thy learned Body, but by book. 12 Combs, Brushes, Scissers, Crisping-irons, are The choicest Tools of thy fantastick Trade; By which more Art appeareth in thy Hair Than in thy Head: which yet more curious made By Powder's help, doth more thy Folly cheat, For 'tis that Powder not thy Dust is sweet. 13 To Sheers and Needle thou thy self inslavest And at the mercy liv'st of each new Cut And upstart Garb: yet when thou in thy bravest And most belaced Servitude dost strut, Some newer Fashion still usurps, and thou Unto its foolish yoke durst not but bow. 14 Thus through a thousand shapes thou art content To croud thy self, Her favour to obtain Who is as Various as the Complement Of thine uncertain Fashions: in vain Thou huntest thus to gain thy slippery Prize: Her Mind as changing as thy Body is. 15 Yet thou inshrin'st in thy devoted breast Her idoliz'd Idea: night and day Thou prov'st thy thoughtful self her zealous Priest, And Contemplation's Sacrifice dost pay: For every Lineament, and every Part Of her, thou mak'st divine in thy fond heart. 16 A Curle of silly feeble Hair, which is The Sport and Scorn of every idle Wind, Like chains of sturdy Adamant can seize And captivate thy most unmanly Mind: Which vain Captivity of thine makes Hair The current granted Name of Locks to wear. 17 Her Motions and her Gestures travers'd are By thy attending thoughts, and ravish'd thou Think'st silver Venus through her limpid sphere Swims with less gagliardise, and knows not how So well to justify her Stile, and prove Her self the Queen of soft leggiadrous Love. 18 Whate'r it be that thou dost hear or see, Thou neither seest nor hearest: she alone Reigns in thy heart, nor can deposed be By any other Thought's intrusion. Thy self is not thy self; nor art thou where Thou art, unless She She be also there. 19 In vain thy Friends remember thee that she Is black without and more deform'd within: Thou know'st no Friend but Her, and joy'st to see All others Envy at thy Choise repine. Infallible thou art, and cause can'st find To think that all the World but Love is blind. 20 In vain they ask thee how thy purse will bear The unknown charge of Wedlock's life: for more Than both the Indies' Wealth thou reck'nest Her; Whom could'st thou gain, Thou would'st esteem but poor, Ev'n Solomon, with his seven hundred Queens And three fair Centuries of Concubines. 21 If She commands, O how thy heart doth leap Into Obedience, though it be to run Through all the vastest most tempestuous Deep Unto the Setting or the Rising Sun! If She forbids; let Earth and Heav'n command, She is thy Goddess and her Will must stand. 22 How reverent's thy Devotion, when thou To sacred Her dost thy Approaches make! With what Zeal of exactness dost thou bow, In meek ambition from her foot to take Thy thirsty Fervor's aim, and thence ascend To drink the dear draught of her milky Hand! 23 Then pour'st thou out thy Soul for thine Oblation On her smooth Lip, thine Altar of delight; Whence thou receiv'st with joyous adoration The Blessings of her Kiss. Her calmy sight Thou think'st thy Heav'n, and in her smiling Eyes Read'st all the Sweets of thy Fool's Paradise. 24 But if coy Frowns, or one denying Glance Becloud that Sphere of thine imagin'd Bliss; How are thy Comforts cast into a trance Of gnawing Dread, and anxious Distress! What jealous fearful Pallor doth surprise Thy Cheeks, what deadly Ghastlyness thine Eyes! 25 If she at last replies by sullen scorn, To thy unwelcome suit; how dost thou hate Thy sleighted self, and wish thou hadst been born To any Reprobation, but that! Happy, in earnest happy might'st thou prove, Could'st thou so much thy God or Fear or Love. 26 When thou in matrimonial Bands art ty'd, (Bands which no Sithe but that of Death can cut,) Though them as soft thou countest as thy Bride. From thine own Freedom thou hast freely shut Thy self, not knowing but that yoke to thee May prove more heavy than Virginity. 27 Fool! couldst thou dream thy female Deity Would let thee know she but an Idol was; Or had not wit to keep thy charmed eye From reading any Line of her Disgrace? Did ever Siren to the Seaman show That her fair Flesh above, was Fish below? 28 Did'st thou thy self unmask thy self, and let Her eyes the face of thy Condition see? What makes thee then surmise she could forget To meet thee with thine own Hypocrisy? Or that her shie demure Sex understood Not more than thine, what 'tis to wear a hood? 29 Alas thou saw'st but half of Her, those years Thou drov'st so hot the Wooer's blinded trade, And had'st full power to take or leave: but Fears And Doubts are now too late, since thou hast made The bargain up; not all the World can ease thee: Thou must be pleas'd although she doth not please thee. 30 Yet grant her genuine Worth and virtuous Graces Answer thy highest Hopes with full success: Still thy Adventure's management debases The fondly-founded credit of thy Bliss: And though thou sit'st in Happiness's lap, Thou can'st not praise thy Wisdom, but thy Hap. 31 If She proves Barren, who is thus thy Spouse, Such such are all thy Hopes and Joyes: if She With numerous Issue fills thy widest House, What warrant hast that these will Blessings be? They easlyest may be bad; nor canst thou tell But thou hast helped to impeople Hell. 32 No Bed so thick with thorns can ever grow As do's the Nuptial: what large Crops of Cares It yields in every time and season! how Fertile and rank 'tis in perpetual Fears! In Winter and in Summer this doth bear, And spreads its harvest over all the year. 33 Besides; unhappy Fortunato, how Wilt thou indure to loose thy precious Dear! Hast thou her Life in lease? or canst thou show A better claim than Death will lay to her? Thy Spouse, how soon thou know'st not, Death may wed, And make the doleful Grave her nuptial Bed. 34 But if thou rests content to be a dry And fruitless Tree, and wilt thy self restrain Within the bounds of strict Virginity; Intestine War will in thy bosom reign, And Legions of Temptations always be In arms against thy single Chastity. 35 Loud will thy fair Estate call for an Heir; So will thy Name, and natural Philauty; So will the thought of crazy Age, and Fear Of wanting an unfained Friend's supply Towards thy grave when years shall bow thee, and For thy Wealth's Carkase Vultures gaping stand. 36 The World will heap on thy Severity Bold Imputations, and surmise that thou Deal'st underhand for what should purchas'd be In open legal manner; or will grow Into belief, thy Pertinacity Hath scorn'd all Females, or all Females thee. 37 Yea they whom Nuptial Cares have vex'd and toss't, In envy of thy Quiet, will lament Thy tedious Solitariness, and boast Their own to be the Life of free Content. Much like Decoys, rejoycing in the Net, Only to tempt more Pris'ners into it. 38 Would'st thou be Rich? then through outrageous Seas, Within three inches of thy death, must thou Sail from thy quiet Home, and yield to be The worried Slave of all the Winds that blow. Through grievous Mines thou must thy Labour reach, And delve to hell thy Plutus thence to fetch. 39 Grant then that He thy largest Coffers fill: Thy Heart's as poor and empty as before: The cursed thirst of Gold grows hotter still Though Plate and Indus thou on it dost poure. The peevish Itch thus proves more fertile when Thou rubb'st and strivest with the tainted Skin. 40 And now, though thou before could'st safely sleep; In fear of Thieves thou break'st thy nightly rest, Setting thy thoughtful Heart a watch to keep About thy Bags. Unhappy Fool! at least Consider, though thy Gold thou holdst so fast, Thy self thou canst not, who must die at last. 41 Die, die thou must, and an account give up Of all the fruitless Store thou hoardedst here. Those Bags on which thy Soul had built her hope, But rich and heavy Torments will appear: And thou shalt bless their Poverty, who had No Reckonings to make when they were Dead. 42 Is Poverty thy Lot? then look to be The helpless Butt of Wrong and of Disgrace. Thy Joints must buckle hard to Industry; Continual Sweat must reak upon thy face; To purchase what must fill and hide thy skin, Least thou without be naked, and within. 43 If Vice to thy assistance thou shalt call, And by thy Sins thy Fortunes hope to mend; Thou digg'st a Pit wherein thy self must fall, And to thy hellish Fo dost succour lend. Thou spend'st thine only stock, and hast'st to be A woful Bankrupt to eternity. 44 If thou a rich-descended Heir art born, 'Tis odds but that thy Birth will thee undo. Such Wealth its Duty thinketh it to scorn In Industry's laborious Paths to go. 'Tis Worth enough, if your young Gallant can Look big, Luxuriate, and Write Gentleman. 45 In Learning's Lists adventur'st thou to trie Thy strength? this makes all Ignorants thy foes; And they wel-near are All. Yet could'st thou flie Their Envie's reach, thy learned Joyes will loose Their taste (if wisest Solomon may be Trusted for judge,) in stinging Vanity. 46 Arts dar'st thou scorn? then dar'st thou be a Beast: Nay beastlier than they; Beasts scorn them not. Thy Scorn's Pride's daughter, and do's but resist The progress of her own aspiring Plot: For are not Arts the ready wings whereby Proud Spirits, as well as Generous, soar high? 47 With martial Bayes dost thou affect to build Glory's fair structure on thy hardy brow? Know then that in the laurel-breeding Field Millions of Dangers and of Vices grow: And those, alas, may thee of life deprive; These, which is worse, may make thee die alive. 48 Or doth the Muse's Wreath thy head invite Restless innumerable Pains to take In Numbers' study? O how few aright Do guide Poetick Feet! how few extend Their Lines by Virtue's Rule! how few escape A Fall from Cynthius's Hill to Venus's lap! 49 But if thou choosest Virtue's lofty way, Nobly disdaining All that flags beneath; If thy dull Body's burden cannot sway Thee downward; if this Life to thee be Death; If pure and heav'nly be the towring Heat Which doth in thy heroick bosom beat: 50 Right generous is thine Enterprise: but yet Strong Difficulties block it up; thy cross And headstrong Passions in array will set Their utmost Powers thy Valour to oppose. Thine own false Heart, unless thy Care be great, Will Traytor prove and her own Aim defeat. 51 Besides; All they whose souls are tainted by Sin's envyous Contagion, will join Their Mischief in a full Conspiracy Thy single Piety to undermine. For all thy Virtue checks and chides their Vice, Thy gracious Glories shame their Villanies. 52 Thou art their Scandal, and their Fame doth call Upon their deepest waryest Craft for aid Against that Blot thy Beauty throws on all Who are of hardy Piety afraid. To force back these, what Weapons wilt thou find; How shall thy Vessel conquer Tide and Wind? 53 Yet through this rampant Sea of Opposition Could'st thou tear ope thy way; how would'st thou tame Those higher stouter Billows of Perdition Whose Wrath in all thy paths doth roar and foam? Hell and its Prince their toughest Nerves combine To terrify and to enervate thine. 54 And sure this Tempest would effect its Spight; On thy weak Bark, did not kind Heav'n descend In part aforehand; did not Grace's Light With cordial Assistance thee befriend; Did She not steer thy Course, and bid thee ride Securely o'r the Surge's highest Pride. 55 Thy Life to Execution only leads. Condemned thee; unless all-pitying She By seasonable Mercy intercedes Between thy Soul and its Catastrophe. Grace only can poor sentenc'd Man reprieve, And find a way to teach his Life to live. 56 'Twas blessed Charis, who so fast did move Phylax his wings when He to Psyche flew, And with the wholesom speed of heav'nly love Her from the Jaws of those Cerinthians drew; By shewing her the horror of that Pit Where Heresy and all her Brood were met. 57 But Phylax thence return'd, without delay His nimble Chariot takes, and Her with it. Strait Gitton sunk and vanished away; For warned by the motion of their Bit The lusty Coursers took their sprightful Wing, And justling through the clouds, away did fling. 58 As Psyche wonder'd whither they would fly, She found her self rapt to a gentle Sphere: No saucy Wind durst ever press so high, Or blow up any Tempest's tumults there. The only Gales which in this Orb did move Were pure delicious Breaths of Heav'n and Love. 59 The only Clouds which greeted there her eye, Thick Volumes of religious Incense were; The only Noise which rolled through that Sky Were holy Echoes welcoming her ear With soft Rebounds of those rich Anthems which The throats and hearts of Saints divinely stretch. 60 She mused much what privileg'd Creatures were Inhabitants in that calm Sea of Bliss: When lo, a troop of glistering Towers drew near To meet her pressing Chariot's earnestness: And straight a goodly Palace fill'd her eye With large and high-erected Majesty. 61 Directly thither, for they knew the Way, The Coursers speeded, neighing as they flew: But Phylax pluck'd the Reins, to bid them stay Their Course, when near the outer Gate they drew. Then lighting, with his Virgin Pupil; He Taught her to see indeed what she did see. 62 Never, said He, my Dear, those Eyes of thine Though they have travell'd through the World so far, Were honored with Objects so divine As these with which they now saluted are. No Pile e'r swell'd to such bright Statelyness, Nor sham'd all Princes' proudest Courts, as this. 63 That pompous Fabrick which great David's Son Erected for a greater King, was plain And poor, if brought into comparison With this Magnificence which here doth reign. As shades the Substance; so did typick that But blindly intimate this Temple's state. 64 The Gold which shin'd, the Stones which sparkled there, Were all th'ignoble Sons of dirty Earth: But these substantial Glories flaming here From Heav'n's fair womb derive their splendid birth. Nor was the Work atchiev'd by mortal Hand, Which firm as Immortality doth stand. 65 Had'st thou my wings, and through the Spheres could'st flie, Heav'n's most Imperial Palace there to read; That Spectacle would feast thy ravish'd Eye But with an ampler Copy, wider spread And fuller drawn; a Copy of what here Is written in a smaller character. 66 Mark well its Situation: Caucasus, The Alps, th'Atlantick Mountains, Ararat, Noble Olymphus, nobler Libanus, Are in their proudest exaltations, not Half so sublime as is this royal Hill, Which almost in both Worlds at once doth dwell. 67 Its worthy Head to Heav'n next neighbour is; Sure upon Hell its conquering Foot is set: On Hell, which often has repin'd at this Oppressing load, and often strove to get Its neck at liberty; but still in vain The Powers of all that vexed Pit did strain. 68 For lo, the Mountain's all one solid Rock Compacted in the strength of Unity: Though Hills of brass should yield unto the shock Of Violence; though Earth's vast Mass should be From its profound Foundation shoulder'd; still All Force must melt before this steady Pile. 69 So stands the craggy Promontory sure, With head triumphing o'r the frustrate Storm, When all the Winds against its Site conjure, And thousand Waves with high-swoll'n fury arm: It stands, and sees the Blasts blown out of breath, And all the Billows shattered beneath. 70 But mark the Fabrick of this outer Gate: Has thy Experience e'r observ'd a more Unlikely Passage to a Court of State? Strong those Materials are; but yet the Door Is built so low, and so extremely narrow, That Worms, not Men, seem fit to scramble thorough. 71 And Worms indeed the Passengers must be, Poor, thin, and humble Things, which enter here. Big puffing Pride presumes in vain that She Shall through this Portal croud; or worldly Care (Swell'd with Incumbrances, and lagg'd with Sin,) At this small mystick Needless Eye thrust in. 72 They whose unhappy Bosoms stuff'd with Gold, Whilst all their Bags lie heaped in their heart; They who in Fat and Ease themselves infold, And never were pinch'd up by any Smart: Too burly are to enter here, and fit Through Hell's wide-gaping Jaws alone to get. 73 And so is He whose boldly-busy Brain, Grown tumid with a thousand Niceties, Of blind yet prying Wisdom, doth disdain Plain simple Faith; and by the Tympanies Of strange, corrupt, hydropick Disputations Each smallest Point into a Mountain fashions. 74 All secular Impostumes, which arise From any Humor's Superfluity, From ranging Lusts, from bubling Vanities, From inward or from outward Luxury; Must at this lowly Passage never hope To find a Pass; for still they dam it up. 75 This said; He led the Virgin to the Gate; Where, though she shrunk and closely gathered up Her self within her self; yet still so great She found her bulk, that she was fain to stoop, And croud, and struggle hard, e'r she could win Tenuity enough to wrestle in. 76 But once got through; a spacious Court she saw, And yet wel-near as strait as was the Door; Such Difficulties all about it grew, Such high, such stoney, craggy Paths, such store Of troublesom Shrubs and Thorns; all which did threat With Snares and Scratches her obstructed feet. 77 Yet by the Angel's prudent Conduct She Rubb'd through, though at the cost of Sweat and Pains: When lo, with recreating Suavity A second Gate her Wonder entertains; A Gate as glorious and as venerable, As was the other poor and despicable. 78 The Posts of milky Alabaster were, So was the Lintel; but the Leaf was all Of purest Crystal, that the Commers near, Before the Door was open set, might fall In love with those interiour Beauties, which Themselves through that clear Perspective did reach. 79 But Psyche here observ'd a serious Maid Who kept the Keys of that transparent Gate, Upon the ground disconsolately laid, Like one who felt and wail'd the Wrath of Fate. Her left hand bolster'd up her heavy head; And on her heavier heart her right was spread. 80 Part of her Tresses Sorrow off had torn, And scatter'd at her feet: what did remain, Neglect dishevel'd clotted and forlorn About her ears: Her Forehead's native Plain Self-hatred o'r and o'r had plowed, and Deep were the furrows of that woful Land. 81 Her pensive Eyes so overladen were With constant Clouds, that downward to the earth They swaid her looks: the Weather ne'r was clear With Her, but when one storm had broken forth Another crouded on; or rather one Continual Flood from both her Fountains ran. 82 The beauties of her Cheeks this wash'd away, And through their hills two sallow chanels cut; This marshal'd liquid Pearls in full array Upon her Clothes, as sadly torn as wet: This made the count'nance of the neighbour ground Deep in th'exuberant brine of hers be drown'd. 83 Disgraced by a Kick of Indignation, The foolish Furniture of Vanity Kept distance from her naked Feet: the fashion Of every Dress was spoild; the gallantry Of all her Jewels, dust and mire did choke; Spilt were her Red and White; her Mirrours broke. 84 Of woful Whips before her lay an heap Red with the Vengeance on her Body she Had sternly took: instead of needful sleep, And proper Cordials, Austerity, With pale-fac'd Watching, pensive Shame, and Fear, And hollow-cheeked Fasts, besieged Her. 85 For grateful Powders to perfume her Head, Cold contemptible Ashes there were strown; Which an untimely hoary Winter spread Upon her Locks, and preach'd to Her her own Beginning and her End, that certain Dust From whence she came, and unto which she must. 86 As Psyche ponder'd who this Maid should be Which like a vanquish'd Prey to Grief did lie; Howe'r She looks, said Phylax, this is She Whom only Heav'n intrusteth with the Key Of this vast Palace; She whose piteous Look, Hath writ her Worth so high in God's own book. 87 Her Name is Penance; and with her must All Whose brave ambition here would get access, Into familiar meek acquaintance fall, And love her painful Life and Wretchedness. Though her embraces comfortless may seem, And cold, yet heav'nly Fervors glow in them. 88 Delightful Ease lies nestling in her Smart, Security inhabits in her Fears, Content keeps house in her disconsolate heart, Pure Solace bathes it self in all her Tears, And in the frowning furrows of her Sadness Are sown the seeds of everlasting Gladness. 89 This Word threw Psyche on her humble knee To beg the favour of that mournful Maid; Who rais'd her self with ready courtesy, And for no stately-long Intreaty staid: Welcome, she cry'd, and seal'd it with a Kiss, And in her sober arms she hug'd her thrice. 90 She hug'd her thrice; and every time she shot Into her Soul Grief's wholesome influence; Whereby intire possession she got Of all her Thoughts, and left her there no sense Or rellish of terrest[r]ial Delight, But fitted her to see this heav'nly sight. 91 Which done; upon her penitent head she spred Part of her Tears, and of her Ashes part: Then to the Door she Her right kindly led, Which as she gently touch'd, did open start. Straitway a Gale of holy Pleasures flew Forth at the Gate, and full on Psyche blew. 92 Thus entred in, she there espies a Well Of clearer crystal far than was that Door: And here, all Purities, said Phylax, dwell; Of limpid Life here lives the endless Store; These Streams alone can conquer those deep Stains Of which the tainted Universe complains. 93 No foolish wanton Nymphs are dabling here; But Graces genuine, and numberless, And all divine, who sutably do cheer Their pious Guests, and bathe their souls in Bliss. Fain'd Venus from her native Sea did rise Less fair than Those this Fountain purifies. 94 For this is Baptism's sacred Laver, where All They must wash the other World away Who enter this new Life's celestial sphere, And of Night's Brats turn Children of the Day. Far hence profane unwashen feet must be; This holy ground belongs to Sanctity. 95 But of such everlasting Virtue is This heav'nly Liquor, that one Drenching will Suffice; and 'tis presumptuous Lavishness A second time its noble Drops to spill: For since Life's purest Day hence takes its Morn, What He can twice into one Life be born? 96 Though thine unhappy Albion will breed Such Imps of Contradiction, as will row Against great Baptism's Stream, and forge a need Of padling in their own new Waters: Thou Shalt find thy single Washing is alone, Sufficient Cleansing; and may'st now go on. 97 This said; he leads her forward through a Way Pav'd with the soul of Sweetness, to the bright Palace, which courted with a full display Of all its parts her now approaching Sight: Magnifick was its Aspect, and upon The Rock look'd like another Mount of Stone. 98 A Mount of Marble, polished and white; But with such Architecture varied, That Majesty was temper'd with Delight. Thus all the Countenance of Heav'n is spred With Awe and Beauty, that Spectators may To it at once both Love and Reverence pay. 99 What goodly Pillars, Arcs, and Walls, were there! What Rows of Lights in equi-distant grace! What learn'd Engravings lived every where With Anticks peopling each convenient space! With what brave strife did cunning Art contend The rich Material's Lustre to transcend! 100 But they by twelve fair steps advanced now; Enter'd the Hall, whose princely Bravery So far outshin'd what they had seen below, That sweetly it perplexed Psyche's eye In walking through the several Wonders, which Did every corner of the Room inrich. 101 The Floor with glittering Silver all was spred, The Allmug Walls with royal Arras drest, The Cedar Roof with Gold imbellished, With glorious Paint the Windows: such a Feast Of pompous sights she never saw before, Though she had view'd Agenor's splendid Store. 102 Yet this was but the handsome case and skin Of what did more Majestick make the Place; For nobly lost were all the Pillars in Innumerable Spoils, which She who was Queen of the Palace, in her Wars had won, And fix'd them here, as Proofs what she had done. 103 Here by their Horns, Dilemmas hanging were, And of big Syllogisms, the empty Skins. Bold busy Wit, lay tame and quiet here; Here Rhetorick, with all her cunning Gins Twisted about her neck; here all the Pride Of secular Wisdom, was close Pris'ner ty'd. 104 Next those, that insolent Severity, That humble Arrogance, which long did reign In th'old admired Porch, hung dead and dry; And chained Zeno knit his brows in vain To see that Doctrine which so far prevail'd, Up here by conquering Truth in triumph nail'd. 105 And yet some comfort 'twas, that He beheld The Pythagorean Prudence hanging by; And its great Master, though he ne'r would yield It fit for Men with Flesh to satisfy Their Hunger's Call, forc'd madly now to eat Himself, and make his chained Arms his Meat. 106 Nor had the Epicurean Discipline Better Success, for she was Captive here; And both with Shame and Hunger taught to pine And dearly pay for her luxuriant Cheer: All lank and thin she hung, like nothing less Than Magazine of swell'd Voluptuousness. 107 Th'Egyptian Learning, black as blackest Hell Where it was bred and born, hung also here; Nor could invent with all its Magick Skill Any mysterious Charm or Character It self from that Disgrace to conjure down, But found Truth's Spells much stronger than her own. 108 By these, the Spoils snatch'd from the furthest Parts Of strangest Indian Worlds, hung one by one; The proud Gymnosophists and Brachman's Arts: (For noble Bartholmew had thither run, And Thomas too; and made their Journey be Only the March of speedy Victory.) 109 So did the Persians' Astrologick Skill, And what in Balaam's Midian School was taught: A mighty Prize was this, the Flower of Hell, With thousand Sects of various Learning fraught; Yet none of these could calculate that They Should unto Catholick Truth become a Prey. 110 Nor did the Academick Glory, 'scape, Though sage grave Plato rais'd it fair and high; For here it hung in contemptible shape, Presenting more of reverend Foolery, Than genuine Wisdom, and lamenting that It reach'd so near to Truth, yet reach'd it not. 111 Next this, the Oracles of the Stagarite, (That God of logical and wrangling Brains,) Hung all in scorned miserable plight, Unable to Confute their conquering Chains; And wish'd that they their Master's fate had seen, And drowned with him in Euripus been. 112 Yea ev'n the Skeptick Protean Cunning too, For all her wiley wiles, was taken here; And now convinced by her certain Wo, Confess'd some Truth could naked be and clear; And into palpable assurance grew That her Captivity at least was True. 113 In one side of the Hall these marshall'd were; Nor did the other with less Spoils abound: For all the Sadducæan Points hung there, Too late bewailing what too late they found, That they from thence should no Redemption have, Who held no Resurrection from the Grave. 114 And in the same condition hanging was Stubborn Herodianism, but buckled now; Finding that Help to its distressed Cause Its dead and rotten God could not allow; That Herod proved no such kind of Thing As Christ, of Glory and of Power King. 115 Essæan Prudence too was fain to bear Her Fate, and share in this Captivity; Though all her Ways, and Grounds, and Doctrins were Of nearest kin to Truth: yet seeing She Made least resistance, Justice gave command She should be tyed in the gentler Band. 116 But puff'd with zealous Ignorance and Pride, The Pharisaick Discipline held out In flat defiance: bravingly she try'd Her fancied strength, and obstinately fought. And much she might have done, had Truth not been Aided by Heav'n to bring her Pris'ner in. 117 Yet after Her, innumerable Swarms Of peevish restless Vermin undertook The War again; and being once in arms, From sucking sneaking Schisms, they boldly broke Into the monstrous amplitude of those Black Heresies whose depth Hell only knows. 118 The Authors lately in their native Pit Psyche beheld, and here their Brood she sees; The hideous Portents of malitious Wit, And piety-pretending Villanies; Which now perforce their open Shame confess, All hanging in their odious Nakedness. 119 They Naked hung; yet clothed in their gore; Which livery too they gave the neighbour Wall, Whilst they with rage their viperous Members tore And upon one another spit their Gall; Stark mad their huge and warlike selves to see The Subjects of eternal Triumph be. 120 But one strange Spoil (though but prophetick yet) More eminent and ugly than the rest Upon a special Pillar, high was set; The Presbyterian God, demurely drest In solemn Weeds, spun all of Publick Weal, Pure Christian Liberty, reforming Zeal. 121 His name was Covenant; and the Sacrifice He gormandiz'd, more vast then that of Bel, Or of the Dragon; for no smaller prize Than Church and State would serve his paunch to fill: For which huge feast he had as long a Grace, And this ycleep'd the Directory was. 122 But stretch'd at length by this enormous Diet, The wretched Idol's maw in sunder burst: Forthwith the Issue of his boundless Riot Flow'd out in millions of Sects, which curst Their monstrous Parent, and are here with meet Decorum rank'd and fetter'd at his feet. 123 These Trophies right heroick were: but yet The upper end of this illustrious Hall With gallanter Memorials was beset: For all about the fair and lofty Wall Hung goodly Tables, offring to the Eye A full account of larger Victory. 124 The first display'd subdued Asia's face, Where Conquest at Jerusalem begun Her noble Progress, rending ope her ways Quite through the heart of every Region; Nor stay'd her Chariot, until it met The rising Sun, and fairer shew'd than it. 125 The second, generous Europe did present, The Queen of Arms and Arts, and yet too weak And silly, to confute or stop the Dint Of Christian Vigor, which undaunted brake Through all her Quarters, till both Rome and Greece Yielded, and su'd for Evangelick Peace. 126 Hot sandy Africk boiled in the Third, Where all its Monsters gentle grew and tame; Not frighted by the Lightning of the Sword, But mollify'd by Christ's sweet-thrilling Name, Which won (though with an Eunuch it began,) At length the mightyest and compleatest Man. 127 The fourth, by Prophesy was painted; which Decyphered a strange untutored World, In golden Mines and Veins of Silver rich, But poor in all the best of Wealth, and hurl'd Quite on the Backside of these Climes which then Were known to this our Universe's Men. 128 Yet was the Church assur'd that She should through The vast Atlantick reach her conquering Arm; And on the Western Ev'n her East bestow, Which Pagan Cold with Christian Heats might warm: She was assur'd, her Baptism's Streams upon The wealthy Shore of noble Plate should run. 129 As Psyche paid her Admiration to These Marvels, through whose stories one by one Phylax' expounding Tongue vouchsaf'd to go; Far goodlyer Sights, said he, this Mansion Do's yet afford: These but the Preface be (And poor enough) to what thou now shalt see. 130 Then up a spacious Ascent He brings Her to the Presence-chamber of the Queen. O what celestial, what matchless Things Were sparkling in this holy Glorie's Scene! Which whilst the Angel read to Psyche, He Was ravished well near as much as She. 131 This precious Pavement first observe, said He; Thy foot ne'r trampled on such Worth as this. The floor's no less than pure Humility, As smooth as Politure's own dainty Dress Yet softer than those Carpets are whose sweet And silken Kisses flatter Princes' feet. 132 The Walls are built of neither Wood nor Stone, No nor of Brass, of Silver, or of Gold, Or any Substance which Duration Can make decrepit as it groweth old: O no! these pure Materials are such As wretched Weakness must not dare to touch: 133 Of genuine Strength and of Security They temper'd are, and correspondence keep With their foundations which fixed lie Upon a Rock that scorns the raging Deep. As Those, the Pow'rs beneath; so These disdain All them above which in the Air do reign. 134 These Walls; which gloriously clothed are With all the Gospel Wardrobe: there thy spouse Is Born; to Egypt there he flies; and there He is Baptized: there his Power flows In miracle's full Deluge; there he hath His Cross; and there to life is drawn his Death. 135 The Roof, whose patent Arch and azure Hue Like Heav'n's Epitomy above us flows; With no hypocrisy deludes our View, Being conscious of more Value than it shows. Well may it dazel thy poor mortal sense, For 'tis no less than God's own Providence. 136 Those middle Pillars which so stoutly set Their lusty shoulders under it, are cast Of sound substantial faith; though Rocks should split; Though Earth's vast Groundsels which are ramm'd so fast About the Center, should in pieces fly; These still will hold their own Solidity. 137 That strange solidity, whose mystick Root Quite cross to all the World is taught to grow; For its profoundly paradoxick foot Implanted is above and not below; Whilst by Love's all-uniting-strengthning Art The Roof it self the Pillars doth support. 138 Those spacious Windows, which like limpid Eyes Adorn this Chamber's face, are not of Glass, (The brittle Emblem of fair Vanities,) But firmest Hope; through which the Soul doth pass, And climb aforehand to those Joys above Which have monopoliz'd her loyal love. 139 That golden Chimney, and the fire which there With unconsuming Sweetness flames so high, The Shop and fervent Operations are Of strong and never-idle Charity; Whose soft Extremities of fostering Heat As Pulses in true Christian bosoms beat. 140 But this resplendent Mount of Majesty Which crowns the Navel of the Chamber, this Large Diamond Throne, whose Glories far outvy The rays of Solomon's, erected is For Her whose Beauties make the Seat appear But poor and dim when it supporteth Her. 141 Just as he spake, from her retiring Room, Attended by her most imperial Train, To that her Throne the Queen her self did come, And justify the Angel's word: in vain The Diamond strove, for all its Sparks gave way To Her's, as Stars to Phebus and his Day. 142 No sooner set, but She to reading fell Out of a golden Scrol those sacred Laws Which from her sovereign Assent and Seal Look'd for their life and Soul. This lucky Pause Warn'd Psyche too to read, who for her Book Could choose no other but this Monarch's Look. 143 A Look in which such blessed Gallantry Its triumph held, that Psyche judged Her No daughter of Mortality to be, But sprung from Race divine: nor did she fear Idolatry in worshiping a face In which all Heav'n, and more, compacted was. 144 But as her knees were melting to the floor, Phylax commands her first to satisfy Her eye's profoundest hunger with that store Of royal Chear, whose superfluity Was so excessive: and thou then, said He, Shalt know who is this Queen of Sweets, from me. 145 Thou then shalt know, when by due Observation Thou of her sovereign Worth instructed art That so thy well-confirmed Admiration May soberly perform its Dutie's part, And blot out that rash Zeal, whose hasty fire Inflam'd thy Soul Pseudagius to admire. 146 This Precept She obey'd: but as a Child Into a Prince's Garden brought, which he Sees with innumerable Beauties fill'd; Yields up himself to dainty Ecstasy, Not knowing where he should begin to gather, Being woo'd by every flower from one another: 147 So in delicious Confusion She Among the Graces of this Empress lost Her wandring self, nor could resolved be Which Part deserv'd her Admiration most: She look'd to find one better than the rest, But look'd in vain, for every one was Best. 148 Down from the Head of this accomplish'd Queen To her fair foot, there was no room for Blame: Sooner shall Pitch in Venus's Rayes be seen; Sooner shall Glory's face be damp'd with Shame; Sooner shall Crystal guilty be of Blots, Than purer She can be accus'd of spots. 149 As through the roseal casements of the East Aurora looks, when fresh come out of bed; So is her briskly-blooming Aspect drest With all the Delicates of blushing Red: Yet though these streams of Blushes overflow, Firm truce maintain they with their neighbour Snow. 150 As modest Phebe in th'unclouded sphere Smiles with chaste beauty, so do's chaster She: Nay more than so; for virgin Mildness here Is married to Titan's Majesty: The Moon's sweet silver, and his stately Gold Are in this face's Orb together roll'd. 151 Yet such its temper is, that if bold Eyes Its Sweetness dare; such Terrors flame in it As from a martiall'd Army's front surprize Cold-hearted Cowards, when the Standards get Their cue to poure ther awful Colours through The Air, and stately Banners open flow. 152 This makes the Ladies' precious features be As pleasant as the gracefullest Excess Of Tirzah's Beauties; and her Bravery As rich as Salem's was in Portlyness, When her best Excellence had crown'd her Queen Of whatsoe'r below the Sun was seen. 153 But as th'illustrious Tree of Victory, The verdant Palm, lifts her triumphant head Above the vulgar shrubs: so glorious She Her princely stature. And 'tis fairly read In all her Hall's bright Characters, how near Of kin the Palm and She by conquests are. 154 Carmel, which looks from his exalted seat With state upon the Vales that creep beneath, And is so strong in high-grown Woods, so sweet In fragrant Pastures, fairly copieth Her goodly Head, that living Coronet Enobling all the Members under it. 155 As from steep Gilead the milky flocks Of climbing Goats right gracefully appear; Such is the prospect of her flaxen Locks Whose merry Curles like Kids all sporting are; And by their sport, though feeble Chains they be, Do captive take the King of Majesty. 156 Beneath the curious Arbour of her Hair Half-hid, half-ope her sacred Temples lie, Which like a rich Pomgranat lovely are, And lovelyer by that open secresie, For what is naked speaks for what is hid; Whence more Desire is in Spectators bred. 157 He who by fair Bethrabbim Gate hath seen The Pools of Heshbon even with the brim, Where living Smiles inhabit, where serene And genuine Purities delight to Swim; Where both the Stars by night, and Sun by day As in a softer Heav'n delight to play: 158 The Emblem of her Eyes hath He beheld; Her Eyes, the smiling Mirrours whence those beams Which dart forth Loves and Joyes, which sweetly gild Spectators' hearts, poure out their gracious streams; Her Eyes, the sparkling Nests of brightest Bliss, The purest Springs of mystick Paradise. 159 That white and stately Tower of Marble which Down from its Lebanon its looks extends As far's Damascus; did aforehand preach That princely Beauty which her Nose commends; Whose alabaster Prominence doth grace And fortify the region of her face. 160 Her Lips, of Scarlat are a fine-spun Thred; Yet not so fine or delicate as is The rare Effusion which through them is shed When that sweet fount of Eloquence doth bless Admiring Auditors, when vocal Gold And Honey from th'enclosed Tongue is roll'd. 161 No Sheep, new-shorn and even, and washed white, And marching home in decent order; can Tickle Beholders' eyes with more delight, Than her two Ranges of fair Ivory, when A Smile, or some such sweet occasion hath Display'd the equal Orders of her Teeth. 162 As David's portly Tower, the dwelling-place Of Comelyness and Strength; such is her Neck: A thousand mighty shields that Fortress grace, And this as many lovely Jewels deck, Or rather decked are by hanging there; Their wealthy Home for them can lustre spare. 163 Two tender Roes, the Sons of one spruce Dame And of one Birth, which in a lily field Are put to pasture: in another name Are her two Breasts, with polish'd softness swell'd, Which in her Bosom's fragrant garden feed Where whitest Sweetness takes delight to breed. 164 Her royal Robe is all of purest Silk; In softness parallel to her own Skin, In spotless Whiteness, to her precious Milk. A cunning needle over it had run, And scatter'd pritty Hills and Valleys, where Neat flocks of Lambs feeding and sporting were. 165 But as when April's gentle Breath doth wake The floury Eyes of Lebanon, or plays Against his balmey Boughs, the Odours take The soft alarm, and their sweet Powers raise: So this rich Vesture's Smell replies to all The Complements of every fanning Gale. 166 To either Hand belongs a Massy Key The royal Scepters She was born to sway: The one of beaten burnish'd Gold, which She Hugs in her Right: for through Heav'n's narrow Way Though many struggle, none can enter at That Port of Bliss, if this locks up the Gate. 167 But her Sinister one, of Iron is: A swarthy fatal Key, which keeps the door Of everlasting Torment's foul Abyss, Where anathematized Miscreants roar. Proud Belzebub, although he Sovereign be Of Hell, possesseth not his Kingdom's Key. 168 No; this is Her Prerogative alone Who Arbitratrix sits of Heav'n and Hell: And though her gentle Soul delights in none But her mild Bliss-unlocking key; yet still She maketh her abused Sweetness just Against rebellious unrepentant Dust. 169 The Diadems of garish Gold and Gems She to the heads of mortal Princes leaves; That Heav'nly flame which round her Temples streams, A richer Crown of living Glory weaves; Which Mitre-like, and like the mystick guise Of Cloven Tongues of sprightful fire doth rise. 170 But for a Canopie to shade her head; No Babylonian Embroidery, No Tyrian, nor Phrygian Texture's spread, No artificial Help of Majesty, No State which lasts no longer than 'tis stay'd And fastned up by Cords' and Pillars' aid. 171 A Dove, not hatch'd in sublunary Nest, Nor hatch'd at all, but of eternal Breed; Weigh'd on his equal Wings, displays her Crest At near but comely distance o'r her head: Where by his splendid widespread feathers He Is both her Glory and Security. 172 This was the Queen; on whom as Psyche gazed; The reason why, my Dear, said Phylax, so At her high Gallantry thou stand'st amazed, Is, That thou know'st not yet her Name, nor who Hath her espous'd. O pitty then, cry'd She, Sweet Tutor, this my Ignorance and Me. 173 He, by a speaking Smile at first, then by This smiling Speech, his pupil satisfy'd: That Queen, Ecclesia is, and to the high And mighty King of Kings the sovereign Bride: Poor of her self, and sprung from Mortal race, But thus advanced by His bounteous Grace. 174 Those Princes who descended are of Clay, Are fain to make a tedious search to find Ladies whose florid features answer may The brisk Ideas of their youthful Mind; Nay for a Dowry oft they hunt, that so The Maid and Money they may marry too. 175 But it becomes Heav'n's Emperor to make, Not seek a Spouse which may his fancy please; Nor can it with his Greatness stand to take A Portion with his Bride, who Owner is Of more than thine, or Phebus's larger eye Could in his furthest Travels e'r descry. 176 Both Thou, and every pious Soul beside, As Spouses by his Favour owned are: But She alone is his Imperial Bride, His Heart's own Heart, his most indeared Dear. One Lady thus to glorious Solomon Amongst his Thousand was his Only One. 177 Before, alas, She black and crooked was, The nasty Sink of all Deformities: Such heaps of odious Blains and Boils; a Mass Of such Distortions; such rank Heresies Of Form and Feature; could not any where Be found in one Colluvies, as in Her. 178 Indeed when first She in her Filth was born No friendly Hand took care to Wash her clean, Or cut her Navel: helpless and forlorn In her foul blood she lay, till He sent in His yearning Providence, relief to give, Which on Death's brink commanded her to Live. 179 She Liv'd: but so as still her Life confest By its Procession, what its Entrance was: Yet when all other Lovers did detest The thought of her most ugly-vile embrace; In Jesus steps, and cries, why may not She Grow beautious by my superfluity? 180 Then from the Mine of his exuberant Graces Ten thousand rich and radiant Things he takes; Which all about the wondering Maid he places, And of a Worm this Queen of Glory makes; That chosen she might be embellished Proportionably to his royal Bed. 181 And that she also might attended be With fair and sutable Retinues to Her radiant Self; that Train magnifick He Both furnish'd and maintaineth for her: lo With what prest forwardness they waiting are About her sparkling Throne, and brighter Her. 182 The formost Squadron is of threescore Queens, Who yet can from her Service, Honor take: The next's of fourescore goodly Concubines; But they who those exterior Ranges make, Where in a number numberless they flow, Are Virgins all, both white and chaste as Snow. 183 These were the minor single Churches, spread So thick in every Gospel-conquer'd Place; Which still their Strength and their Dependance had From this most Catholick Majesty, which was Diffus'd as wide's all they, and never found That Land or Sea which could its Progress bound. 184 These every Morn, and every Evening raise Their homage in religious Anthems high; Paying their Admiration and Praise To Her the Monarch of all Piety: And happy Tributaries too are they Who always Gainers are by what they pay. 185 But mark that Company whose station is Before the Throne; true Maids of Honor, whose Sweet privilege it is this Queen to Dress: Their hands alone have her adorn'd with those Embellishments, which round about her shine, And make that fairer look which was Divine. 186 That slender strait-lac'd Maid, is Unity, Who buckles on (for that's her proper part) That golden Girdle which so decently Huggeth her Sovereign's Loins: and with what art Her noble Duty she performs, thou may'st Read in the Queen's epitomized Waste. 187 That sober Matron, in whose stayed Eye, And venerable Face, so fair are writ The awful Lines of Heaven, is Sanctity: Who reverently before the Queen doth set Her faithful self, and serves her for a Glass By which to guide and order all her Dress. 188 The Next, whose Soft and yielding Looks confess The temper of her heart, is Patience: Her Empress she bedecks with Tenderness And makes her slow and loth to take offence; That all her Subjects by her Softness may Be charm'd, so kind a Princess to obey. 189 But Magnanimity, that highlook'd She, Embraves that Mildness with right active Fire; This that Virago is, who scorns to see Any Exploit of Gallantry outvie her. Ecclesia's Brows with Stoutness she doth build, And helps her both her mighty Keys to weild. 190 She whose wideopen Breasts so fairly swell, And wears as large a Purse upon her side; Who looks about to see where she may spill Her teeming Charity's never-ebbing Tide; Is Bounty, Almner to the Queen, whom she Likewise arrays with Grace and Courtesy. 191 That other, whose ev'n Look was never knit Into a Frown, nor loos'd into a smile; Whose right hand holds a Sword, whose left a fit And equal Balance, Justice is; who still As Cases come, her Ladie's eyes doth dress With what is neither Wrath nor Friendlyness. 192 She whose sharp Eye looks all things through and through, And sees both sides of double-faced Chance; Who in Futurity's blind Sea can rowe, And take a plenal Prospect by a Glance; Is searching Wisdom, and do's every morn Her Sovereign's Head most studiously adorn. 193 That amiable sweet-complexion'd Maid Is Temperance, which keeps the Queen so fair: In all Distempers She with ready Aid Knows how her health and beauty to repair: Her Body sound, her skin she maketh sleek; She with warm Roses trims her lovely Cheek. 194 Those other Virtues too (for All are there,) Attend their several Offices. But turn, And mark that neighbour Combination, where Far nobler Virgins wait; that thou may'st learn By their rare Worth how glorious is She Whose houshold Servants they are proud to be. 195 That martial She all over writ with Scars, Laden with Palms, and clothed round in Blood, Ecclesia's Champion is: ten thousand Wars She waged hath, and valiantly withstood The Outrages of Earth and Hell; her Name Is Martyrdom: her Story, highest Fame. 196 That plainlook'd Maid, whose course and simple Hue May seem Discredit to this gorgeous Place, Is Poverty; who though to outward view She shines with no alluring courtly Grace, Yet is within as truely bright and fair As on their outside her Companions are. 197 For Jesus, who the heart of things doth see, Was so inamor'd of her Beauties, that He chose to dwell with Her alone when He Entred upon His Theanthropick State: And Her (so high He found her Worth) commended To Queen Ecclesia when He hence Ascended. 198 The next, her Sister is, Obedience: Thou never saw'st a Twig more apt to bow, Nor Wax more pliant, whensoe'r her Prince Summons her Duty into Action: though A Will she once had of her own, yet She Gave it her Queen, that so she might be Free. 199 For, prudent as she was, right well she knew How edg'd a Tool is every Humane Will, Oft making her enslaved Owners rue Her desperate Freedom; whose carreer to quell The safest way she found, was to submit Her to a wiser Rein and stronger Bit. 200 Lo there Virginity her self: O who Can count the Graces reigning in her eyes; Or those which all about her body flow In Love's and Pleasure's chaste Extremities! Precious she is to Heav'n it self; for she As truely is Angelical as We. 201 Indeed the old Acquaintance which we had With her pure Softness, makes us what we are, Upon our Wings her Hands their Whiteness spread; 'Tis she who frees us from vexatious care, And gives us leave to be attendant on The bus'ness of Heav'n's Sovereign alone. 202 The Tenderness which smileth in her Face Cohabits with heroick Bravery; Which can ev'n from your mortal Weakness chase Faint Nature's inbred Imbecillity; Incouraging dull Flesh it self to strain And with pure Spirits equal pace maintain. 203 She, she it is, who scorneth to enjoy A Dispensation from her Lord's advice; Who chooseth not, to do all that she may, But all she can; who generously flies Soul-bigamy; who to her heart allows, Since She's betroth'd to Christ, no other Spouse. 204 But there stand Ladies more illustrious yet, Stars of the first and fairest Magnitude; To which this Universe is deep in debt For that commanding Light whose dint subdu'd The monstrous Night of Ignorance which had All Nations its blinded Pris'ners made. 205 That awful Maid, Heav'n's glorious Amazon, Before whose March the World made haste to bow, And take the Evangelick Yoke upon Its conquer'd neck; thou by her Looks may'st know: O brave Apostleship, which hast outrun The Course, outshin'd the Glories of the Sun! 206 The Lady Treasurer is She; into The faithful hands of whose dispensing Care Ecclesia's precious Store was put; that so All pious Souls might be directed where To find their holy Food, the heav'nly Word And Sacraments of their most provident Lord. 207 Behind her standeth her apparent Heir, Who, when to heav'n she steps, her Office takes: Yet, modest as she is, doth still forbear The Glory her great Mother's Title speaks, And meekly turns the Apostolical Denomination to Episcopal. 208 But when the Tide of Converts flowed high, Episcopacy happily was forc'd To substitute that sacred Deputy Part of the Charge to bear which She at first Manag'd alone: behold the Virgin there; Priesthood's the Name she honored is to wear. 209 She, in whose startled Look and dazell'd Eye Enthusiastick Characters appear, Is sacredly-inspired Prophesy: Earth's Monitor, Heav'n's Privy-counseller: She, whose quicksighted Soul can Wonders see A day, a year, an age before they be. 210 The next, is Doctrine; in whose lips there dwells A spring of Honey sweeter than its Name; Honey which never fulsome is, yet fills The widest Souls; Honey which first did stream In Heav'n's most happy Canaan, and thence Remov'd to Earth's its blessed Influence. 211 The Sixth's, that mighty She, to whom the Prince Of Wonders left the noble Legacy Of his miraculous Power; which ever since Hath flourish'd in her potent Arm: for She Still triumphs over Nature's Laws, and still Makes Mountains stoop to her imperious Will. 212 The Seav'nth's, the Mistress of profounder Art Than in the brain of Æsculapius grew: She calls no Roots nor Herbs to take her part; Nor needs the virtuous souls of Plants to brew; But by her Touch, or her commanding Breath Knows how to slay both Sicknesses and Death. 213 The Eighth, whose ready and officious Eyes Her Ministerial Aptitude declare, Is She who on the sacred Mysteries With reverent distance waits, and takes the care Of Those who, did not pious Charity Keep open house, would no where harbour'd be. 214 The Ninth, whose Stature rises high and fair, So broad whose Shoulders, and whose Breast so wide, Whose Joints well-knit, whose Bones well-timber'd are, But stronger far her Heart; is signify'd By these sure Marks firm Goverment to be, The Pillar of Ecclesia's Policy. 215 See'st thou the Last? know Psyche, wondrous she Can by no Token but her Tongue be known; And yet her Tongue's strange Multiplicity Looses her self again; for what's her own Of all the Languages with which she flows, (Each one so right she hits,) no Censor knows. 216 She in their proper Dialects can trade With all the World, and Heav'n's Wares set to sale: No Sound to Sense a Dress was ever made But she with it can strait acquainted fall, And best determin whether it doth sit Upon that Sense's shoulders right and fit. 217 Unhappy Babel's Antidote is she, And cures the Wound which there did Tongues divide: All Languages in her sole Lips agree, For to her single Tongue they All are ty'd; So are their Virtues too, and Eloquence Dwells there in all her Tunes of Excellence. 218 But now behold where at the Queen's right hand, As best deserving that illustrious Place, The Flower of all these Maiden Flowers doth stand, The Gallantry ev'n of her Queen to grace: A Virgin fairer than her native Nest The silver Spheres, which by her Birth were blest. 219 Lo she from head to foot all Naked is, As are the Sun by day and Stars by night: Her self She with her proper Beams doth dress, As they with their Attire of natural Light. External Helps true Beauty never lacks; 'Tis Shame alone which Vestments useful makes. 220 Who ever thought the Rose or Lilly stood Guilty of course unhandsom Nakedness, Because they never put on borrowed Hood, Nor veiled up their native Sweetnesses? For where shall Ornaments be found which may Fairer, such Sons of Goodliness array? 221 Believe it Psyche, she doth but retain Her Countrie's fashion: they whose Bliss it is In Heav'n, the Realm of richest Pomp, to reign, Profess no other kind of Dress but this; They naked go of whatsoe'r might hinder Or cloke the Grace of their arraying Splendor. 222 A Texture all of Glory, soft and white As is her virgin Soul, surrounds her: when Darkness can smutch the highnoon Face of Light, When veins of Ink in floods of Milk can run; Then may a Critick hope to spie in her Pellucid Robe of Nakedness, a Blur. 223 That Nakedness, which though it breeds Desire, In every Heart not stupify'd with stone, It kindles none but sweet and spotless Fire; In whose pure furnace brave Devotion Learns with more sprightful fervency to glow, And Chastity it self refin'd doth grow. 224 But O what Powers are flaming in her Face, Pouring her Conquests upon every Eye! The hardyest He that e'r on her did gaze, Yielded and lov'd his sweet Captivity. Error her self, though swell'd with Pride and Hell, In her bright presence is content to kneel. 225 Her name is Truth; and what her Care and Charge Judge by those Tokens which her Hands present; Two Autographs: that in her Left, the large And Old, but never-failing Testament: That in her Right, the New: which could with none Justly intrusted be, but Her alone. 226 For every Leaf of them a Mirrour is In which she reads her own unspotted Face: Each Line is taught sincerely to express Some correspondent Lineament of Grace In her sweet Body, whose all-lovely Looks Are nothing but the Life of those dead Books. 227 Bold Heresy has often in that Glass Presum'd to peep, and swore that there she spyed The faithful shape of her own faithless face: But yet the shameless Elf as often lyed. That trusty Glass will no false Colours shew, But unto Truth, and Truth alone; is true. 228 And though Rebellion too hereafter will Be studying here, and prying how to find The pourtraiture of her foul self; yet still The Lustre of the noble Book will blind Such saucy Readers, whose true Image is Reflected only in Hell's black Abyss. 229 But mark what clings about the Virgin's breast; A Knot of Things whose Splendor bids thine Eye Be with a Glimpse content, and not contest With what confounds bold Curiosity. Faith's Mysteries they are, which by the bright Excess of their own beams, are hid from sight. 230 In vain thou seek'st these flames to parallel By any Raies which e'r amaz'd thine Eye: Souls which in most heroick Worth excel Cannot endure their naked Majesty; But happy count themselves that they can see These Mysteries ev'n through a Mystery. 231 And happy thou, my Psyche, who are hither By Heav'n's indulgence and my conduct, brought; If thou that Bliss neglected not to gather Which now is ripe, and bids thy Heart not doubt Here freely to inrich its Poverty At highest heav'nlyest Wealth's own Treasury. 232 Thus Phylax spake: and Psyche all the while, Viewing these several Glories of the Court, Did with as many Satisfactions fill Her wondring spirit, and her self transport From this to that; till Truth's strange Contemplation Monopolized all her Admiration. 233 For as the noble Eaglet perched high In open prospect to the naked Sun, Banquets and riots with her ravish'd Eye In that bright Sea of Beauty, where alone Her genuine Sight meets with its flaming Love, And by his sovereign Beams its own doth prove: 234 So She with strong impatient Ardor here Stood feeding upon Truth's all-glorious Face; Where since she found most satiating Cheer, She therefore still unsatiated was: Till lost in amorous Greediness, she cries, Sweet Guardian help me, or thy Psyche dies. 235 Phylax, who knew the soul of that Complaint, (For on his own it beat) with tender Hand Reliev'd his Pupil as he saw her faint; And, Well, said he, thy Grief I understand: Fear't not; though sharp, 'tis salutiferous; Thy Joys had dy'd, hadst thou not Grieved thus. 236 The Pictures of thy late Acquaintance, and Newly imbibed Doctrins, in the Eye Of thy now self-revenged Conscience stand; Checking thy venturous Credulity, Which durst embrace such Monsters, and dismiss A Beauty so divinely bright as this. 237 Yet let not Sorrow quench thy Hopes, for She All Injuries rejoyceth to forget: She never laughed at the Misery Of any Heart which would to Her submit: Revenge indeed, but soft and sweet she takes; Her Foes to Liberty she Captives makes. 238 This said: his Charge to that bright Maid he led; Whom, by their old Acquaintance he desired Her favour on this begging Soul to spread, Who with her lustre was already fired. Truth gently smiled at his sweet Request, And by her Looks her forwardness confest. 239 Forthwith, as humble Psyche trembling lay, Pouring her tears and heart at her fair feet; She mildly took her up, and gave her joy That she was rescued thus from Error's Net. That word she clos'd with an Embrace; and this She more indeered by an Heav'nly Kiss. 240 As when the vernal life-enlivening Sun Embraceth languid Earth with courteous Raies; Through her cold starved Veins fresh fire doth run; New Life and Verdure smile in all her face, Herby and floury Gallantry combine Their fairest powers to make her mantle fine: 241 So Psyche hugg'd and warm'd intirely by The Arms and Lips of Truth, soon felt her breast, Before envellopp'd in Obscurity, Now by a pure and precious Light possest: She felt her inward Mystick Day arise, Which gently flourish'd through her wondring eyes. 242 O mighty Truth! whose glorious Nakedness The troublous burly furniture transcends Of strongest Arguments; whose winning Kiss Presseth thy Conquests home; whose look commands Success; whose brave Conclusions need not stay Till tedious Premisses prepare the way. 243 Logos, who had so pert and busy been, Was strangely startled at the sudden sight: For to himself his Blindness now was seen, So critical was this new-dawning Light: He saw his Blindness, and in seeing this, Descry'd withal a thousand Mysteries. 244 And that so clearly, that he fear'd no more What Mists Authades in his way could throw; Agyrtes Charms he scorned, which before To Darkness's paths had power his feet to draw: This happy Morn he bless'd and kissed, which His eyes with Heav'n's true Prospect did inrich. 245 For here far more convincing Things he read Than were his late adored Demonstrations. No brisk Distinction now durst show her head, Or hope to damp those glorious Probations Which to Syneidesis her self so great Appear'd, that unto them her seal she set. 246 Nor less on Thelema this Wonder wrought; For with intire submission down she bow'd Her high and mighty Neck, and low did lout To what her sober Logos now allow'd. Those precious Gems she hugg'd within her heart, Resolved never more with them to part. 247 With holy sprightful joy replenished Was Psyche, at this happy Change's sight: All Catholick Verities at large were spread In her bright soul, whence Scruples took their flight; Resigning all that Region to be Possest by Satisfaction's Clarity. 248 Ten thousand Thanks to courteous Truth she paid; And would as many times have paid them o'r; But Phylax her excess of Passion staid, Telling her, she must now employ that store She here had gain'd, where Need requir'd it, and Turn Benefactrix to her native Land. 249 She rose: but at the Throne fell down again To pay her homage to the Empress, who Higher enthroned in her heart did reign: Then with loth willingness she yields to go, Having receiv'd a Benediction from Ecclesia for her dear Viaticum. 250 But as she went, she bless'd the blessed Place: And, O, How happy are the Souls, said she, Who in this holy Court's illustrious Face May be Attendants, and those Glories see With constant freedom, which all Heav'n can dart With one short glimpse on their Spectators' heart! 251 O happy they, who here secured are Far far above unhappy Error's reach! How vainly aimed I my zealous Care To find the Holy Land in Chanaan, which Lost me my foolish self! henceforth to me No Land but this alone shall Holy be. 252 O happy they who in this Hall may Live, Perpetually those noble Spoils to read; And Acclamations of Honor give To Her who all these Monsters' blood hath shed: To Her, whom all the World must yield to be As large as is it self, in Victory. 253 O happy they who have but leave to dwell Here in this Preface to that larger Bliss! This empty Porch alone doth far excel The Fulness of all other Palaces: This is the Morning unto Glory's Day, The Brink of Joy, the Top of Heav'n's highway. 254 O happy they, who in this beauteous Court May wait upon the Porch, and feed their eyes, And with their eyes their hearts, in any sort Upon this House and Home of Mysteries! This Neighbourhood to Bliss, would prove to me A full Infeofment in Felicity. 255 O happy they, who may permitted be Ev'n in this Realm of Thorns, these craggy Ways, This Field of Hardship and Perplexity, This Maze of Fears and Snares, to spend their days! The Prospect to yon Palace would suffice To bless and sweeten all Anxieties. 256 O happy they, who may remain with Thee, Disconsolate Maid, though at this outmost Gate! The Comfort but of such Vicinity To those fair Towers, would easily abate The trouble of thy sighs; and ne'r would I Repent of Penance's sad Company. 257 With these sweet Plaints she measur'd her return, Till to the waiting Chariot back she came. And well was Phylax pleas'd to hear her mourn, And by her sighs blow up the pious flame Of her Affection to that holy place, Which kindled was by Truth's divine embrace. 258 Then mounting up, and gently seating Her At his right hand, his mighty Reins he shook; And these could scarce before his Coursers stir, For strait their leap into the Air they took; Their ready Wings wide Oars displaying, through The waves of that soft Ocean to row. 259 For deeply she remembring what Event Plagu'd her affected stay in Palestine, By dear-bought Wisdom learn'd to be content To leave this reverend Place, though more divine Temptations here invited her to stay; Since wiser Phylax summon'd her away. 260 So when a Child, woo'd by the sporting flame, Is once but scorch'd into a feeling sense Of such fair-faced Danger; Fear and Shame Subject him to his Nurse's Providence, And make him any harmless Lustre shun If but her Nod adviseth him to run. 261 But He, to entertain her by the way With advantageous Discourse, begun To reckon through what worthy Wonders They In their long Pilgrimage's Tract had run. For Repetition's trusty hand both saves The old Impression, and a new one graves. 262 This rous'd her soul to recollect how she Under the shield of Heav'n's especial Grace Through thousand Dangers pass'd; though resolutely Satan and all his Wit engaged was In open field to cross, or undermine By secret Wilyness her brave Design. 263 Afresh her Mind did feast on every sweet And sacred Thing, which all the way she went With rich Varieties her eyes had met: So clearly did the Angel them present In their distinct and proper colours, by His Eloquence's prompt dexterity. 264 Thus in two Chariots she at once did ride: But yet in this of his Discourse she flew With swiftest speed, outrunning ev'n the tide Of Time it self: for still her Joys were new, Cheating her Weariness as He along Through all her Journeys travell'd with his Tongue. 265 Her Voice this tuned by her heart's soft strings To honest Gratitude's ingenuous lays: High was her Key, and delicate the Songs, Composed to the sweetest Air of Praise: For ever may these lips be seal'd, said She, When they suppress the Thanks I owe to Thee. 266 To Thee, dear Pilot of my tender Bark, Which many Rocks e'r this had dash'd in sunder; Which oft had wander'd in the Deep and Dark: Which many storms' proud feet had trampled under; Which many Sands into its Grave long since Had swallow'd: hadst not Thou been my Defence. 267 To Thee, whom no Contempt of mine could drive To just Disdain of this vile Worm: To thee By whose kind Care my better Life I live; If yet I live at all, and rather be Not dead and buried in those sins which I Preferr'd before the Life of Piety. 268 Yet more I owe to Him (and more must pay) By whose appointment Thou conductedst Me: Be still my Guide, and in this loyal Way Of Thanks, instruct me what those Thanks must be. If they must be my Self, I ready am This sacrifice to offer to His Name. 269 His Name, in whose dear Syllables alone I read my self intirely such: for there, There lives the Soul of that Redemption Which snatch'd me from the desperate Bondage where I lay abandon'd to the tyrannous Will Of Pride, Rebellion, Heresy, and Hell. 270 His Name, in which the Praise and Adoration Of His Seraphick and Cherubick Quire Rejoyce to meet: His Name, of every Nation The dearest Joy and sovereign Desire. His Name, which o'r the World's subdued Pride Doth in sublime but gracious triumph ride. 271 His Name, the only Musick which mine Ear Can of no Jars accuse: that lovely Name Which when Heav'n's most melodious Circles hear, They throw aside their other songs, and frame Their Tunes by Jesus's sweets.—Here off she broke, Ravish'd and silenc'd by the Name she spoke. 272 And here the Steeds, who all this while had flown With stout but silent fervor, neigh'd aloud; Their Journey now was to its period grown, And Albion her chalkey forehead show'd; Which with erected Ears, and shaked Mains They doubled strait, and scoured o'r the Plains. 273 Forthwith all clouded in their smoaking foam The Chariot they hurl'd to Psyche's door, Where Phylax bid his Pupil Welcome home; Which she did on her knee to him restore: And then she prais'd the steeds unwearied Pains, Stroking her thanks upon their ruffled Mains. CANTO XX. The Mortification. The ARGUMENT. Right wisely busy in her Leisure, now Psyche asserts her royal Power; and by Severest Tenderness contriveth how In strict Obedience's chain to ty The Commons of her Realm: as knowing well The way to Live, was thus her Self to Kill. 1 Peace, gentle Queen of whatsoever makes Sweets acceptable, Bliss delightful be; What fatal Conjuration of Mistakes Inchanteth mortal Hearts, that they will see Thy Worth not by its own clear light, but by The hideous Glass of War's Deformity! 2 They see Sol's beauty by his proper beams; Gems by their native Lustre them allure; They taste the Fountain's sweetness by the streams; The Rose's scarlet Cheeks can them assure The Flower is gorgeous: yet will they not Thy Graces read, but by a Stain and Blot: 3 The Blot of every Sin, of Blood the Stain, Which in the lawless Fields of Mars doth grow: Thus silly Sheep by sad experience gain To know the safety of the Fold, when through The Mountains straying they have lost their way, And found themselves to Bears and Wolves a Prey. 4 Dear is this Learning, and how oft too late! O how much sooner, and much cheaper might They War's most tedious costly study bate, If they to Thee would come to School, and write But from th'Original of thy fair Eyes; That Book, which dims the Volumes of the Skies! 5 Thy Temper is all Musick; never did The least of Jars thy sweet Complexion crack: From thine, all Concords first were copied; Nor would the Center on his trusty back Agree to bear the World, didst Thou not by Thy dainty Chains his Load upon him ty. 6 In Time's first Dawn, when in th'untuned Deep Each Thing was wroth and snarled at his Brother; When Heav'n and Earth tumbled in one blind heap, Struggled and strove to stifle one another; When with their peevish selves all Creatures fought, And in their own hearts for their Enemies sought: 7 With seasonable Kindness Thou didst come, And those wild Tumults sweetly chase away: The boistrous Pangs of Nature's travelling Womb With happy Quietness Thou didst allay, Making those Embryos friends, who never since Have to that Knot of Love done Violence. 8 All rest contented with the Stations Thou Appointedst them: and Earth is pleas'd as well With her poor Habitation here below, As Stars which in Heav'n's loftiest stories dwell. Nor will the Winds, though big they be and proud, Desire above the middle Air to croud. 9 The surly Sea, who in his boiling Wrath Against the shore with mountainous Waves doth make; Dreadeth that List of feeble Sands, which hath No power his desperate Carreer to slake; Because he reads in it Thy potent Law Which to a meek Ebb chides his proudest Flow. 10 All honest Beasts and sociable, are Made such by Thy mild Influence: in vain The tender Oaten Pipe, and weaker Care Of Pan's plain Sons their silly selves would strain, Didst Thou not first persuade the Sheep to be Best pleased with the Flock's Community. 11 The boldest Brats of Salvageness are not So barbarous, but they to Thy Sweetness yield: The rugged Bears in Thy commanding Knot Are closed fast, when through the widest field They range and roar: nor durst fierce Lyons break Thy yoke of Friendship from their sturdy neck. 12 Men whose discording Tempers them invite To seek new Worlds their several minds to please, Are by Thy Cement taught to take delight In courteous Unions of Families: One House will hold a Brood, when Thou dost join To build their Walls, and their Desires combine. 13 No Cities ever could erected be, Did not Thine Hand the Architecture guide; Were not the sound Materials by Thee For every Street and every Isle supply'd: Their Firmitude to neither Wood nor Stone They owe, but to Thine Unity alone. 14 Most distant Countries Thou canst Neighbours make By safe and friendly Traffick, which doth bear One World into another's Lap, and pack Away the rich and radiant East, that here It may adorn the West; whose mutual Store Of other Wealth requites that Golden Ore. 15 Nations whose differing Languages divide Them from the hopes of joint Community, Are in one Common-wealth securely ty'd When Thou dost knit them up, and make them see That All want friendly Help of All: that One Is next to Nothing when 'tis left alone. 16 A Scepter's mighty Load Thou makest light, And wean'st from Wearyness the Subjects' necks, Except by wilful sottishness they slight Thy Kindness, and their own Subjection vex. For Highnoon's dark to those who will not see; And Feathers Lead, when Men will tired be. 17 When sacred Thou prevail'st, all Laws do so, And fair Astræa ventures down again; Right through the blessed Streets hath leave to go, And awful Modesty fails not to chain All Rudeness up; which once let loose by War Nor Heav'n, nor Earth, nor its own Weal doth spare. 18 The coolest Veil could never yet secure The bashful Virgin from Lust's rampant fire; But when in sober bounds thy Rules immure The youthful Violence of hot Desire; Her only safety lily Chastity To thy white Banner owes, and purer Thee. 19 The Gown may keep the thoughtful Student warm, Yet not but when they kindly are embraced, And girded close by Thy incircling Arm: Else is their poor unguarded Garb outfaced By Buff and Shields; and they enforc'd to try What Habit best will sute them when they fly. 20 For from their Studies reprobated They Though unaccused, must Ejected be; And sadly driv'n to make where e'r they may The Universe their University; Whilst in the Muses' Hives an upstart Breed Of misbegot intruding Drones succeed. 21 All Arts which are of age, and grown complete, That Happiness to Thy Tuition owe: No Honey e'r had chose its dainty Seat In Orator's Mouths; no Bay on Poet's brow Had flourished; did not Thine Influence bless All Learning's Seasons with due Fertilness. 22 By Thy sole Patent Heav'n on Earth hath room; Churches have license to be what they are; God is permitted here to have an Home, And handsome too: thou puttest in the Bar Which bids Profaness learn its distance, and Confess that there's more than one Holy Land. 23 The Walls to their own Altars cannot yield Protection, if Thou lend'st them not Thine aid; The Roof cannot the Rites and Service shield When by Heretick storms they are assay'd, Except Thou help'st the Churches air to clear. And bridle up that popular Carreer. 24 The Theme of everlasting Admiration, Miraculous Love's selected Mystery, Lies prostituted to the Usurpation Of lay unwashed Hands but where by thy Just Discipline, from that Communion this Shameless Community forestalled is. 25 The sacred Priests, who never injur'd be By unrevenged Hand, are not secured, Though all the Reverence of Piety In venerable Awe hath them immur'd; Unless Thy potent Arm be stretch'd to keep The Shepherds from the mouths of their own Sheep. 26 For by the teeth of spightful Accusations Whetted by thousand Lies, they snarle and grin; Then by the crueler Jaws of Sequestrations Grind and devour their patient Pastors, in Prodigious desire that in their stead They may by some rapacious Wolf be fed. 27 Or if their Mercy let them live; 'tis but To mock them by a killing Livelyhood, The Fifth Part; which is sooner spent than got, And that in getting; thus they suck the blood They seemed to have left, and find a way To make their very Charity destroy. 28 Religion's venerable Cedars, They In whom the grand Apostles still survive; Alas, must Root and Branch be torn away, And room to Shrubs and scrambling Brambles give; Vile Underwoods, and their own Planter's shame; Elders in nothing but their stinking name. 29 In vain our holy Mother's own Freehold That Title weareth, so unnatural be Her Sons, and sacrilegiously bold; Unless Thou curb'st their cursed Liberty: Poor Church! she Bankrupt turns, except by Thee Her Patrimony she protected see. 30 Nay Princes, upon whose majestick Head God's Name was poured in the sacred Unction, No sooner are by Thee abandoned; But in despight to their most awful Function Of all th'ingrateful and apostate Scum Of their own Vassals, they the Scorn become. 31 No Region, though before the Garden where All Happiness had ample room to grow, Forsaken is by Thee, but strait doth wear The woful garb of Misery, and flow With streams of briney tears for those sweet currents Where Milk and Honey join'd to make the torrents. 32 But Plenty's Horn in thy fair bosom dwells; Whence, whereso'er thy happy foot but treads, Thy Benisons it liberally spills, And all the Fields with smiling Fatness spreads; Whilst jolly Hinds repay thee honest praise, Not Guns' dread Thunder, but soft oaten Layes. 33 Away sneaks Vice, when thou thy face revealest, And seeks blind Holes to hide her blacker head; Whose Dwellings Thou to chosen Virtues dealest, Cheering them up to take sure root and spread Their Arms so wide that all the Country may Under their shade calm Happiness enjoy. 34 O blessed Maid, how long, how long shall we Our Curses number by the days and years! The tedious days and years, which still we see All black with sullen clouds of fatal Fears, Whilst thou art fled, and leav'st our woful Land In most unnatural War's destroying Hand! 35 How is unhappy Britain now become The Isle of Sorrow which was once of Joy! How have all Monsters made those Fields their Home Where only harmless Sheep were wont to play! How are the Drums and Cannons taught to roar Where only Pipes of Reed were heard before! 36 How have we stained Albion's lily hue In bloody gore, and wash'd that Name away! How has our Red-cross prov'd too truly true To that its Tincture! How are we a Prey Unto our Selves, whilst we have made a Sea No less amidst us, than about us be! 37 A Sea, broke ope from our own desperate Veins, Which both to Crown and Mitre shipwrack threats: A Sea, in which though Some still fish for Gains, They'l be at length the Draught to their own Nets. Alas, there's nothing to be gained here But certain Loss; which makes the Trade too dear. 38 How have we coin'd fond Names of Hate, which we With sword and bullet to the death persue! Are there no Turks! that thus the Unity Of our brave English Name must by a new Portentuous Rent, all massacred appear Into the Roundhead and the Cavalier! 39 Yea ev'n that Roundhead, like his Master's Foot Is clov'n, and into two new Monsters split: The Presbyterian (once the only Root, Now but a Branch,) and Independent; fit And hopeful Twins, and like to multiply Into a more-and-more-divided Fry. 40 How have we strove our Lyon's Nails to pare, Who was before the royal Dread and Awe Of all the neighbour Beasts! How has our Fear And Jealousy now help'd their Cause to grow To greater strength! How has our first Expence But op'd our Purse till all be drained thence! 41 How have our idle Compositions given, Power to our foes' Divisions to maintain! How are our Servants by our Madness thriven Into imperious Lords! whilst We are fain To be at charges toward our own Plunder, And keep an Army up to keep us under! 42 Sweet Queen of Joys, O when, when will it be! When will the blessed Dawn of thy fair Eyes Clear our benighted Hemisphere, that We And all our wonted Bliss, with thee may Rise! Dear Peace, when will thy calming Presence please Our inland Tempest's billows to appease? 43 When shall we cease, with mighty Care and Cost To raise the heap of our own Ruins high! When shall we yield to be no longer tost In waves of self-affected Misery! When shall we with our Tortures cease to play! When shall we Do, what we so often Say! 44 When shall we scorn to make our Isle the scorn Of All who at self-sought Disasters jest! When shall we judge our selves enough forlorn! When shall we think our Woes deserve at least Our own Compassion; that our Bowels may Be wounded only by that healing way. 45 (Such were my Muse's sighs, when She and I Heard in our Cell, the Crack of Church and State So sad a time of its Nativity Had Psyche's legend. For, the better fate Of worried Britan stay'd with Him to come Who only worthy was to bring it home. 46 He wondrous He, upon the Belgick main Imbark'd, and then in triumph landed it Safe on the Kentish Strand: where Charles his Wain Broke from its long and black Eclipse; and met Those gazing Throngs, whose strange Applauses prest Both Heav'n and Earth their Gladness to attest. 47 From hence, to scarce-believing London flew The grand Restorer: in whose glorious Train How suddenly great Britain greater grew, Outshining her old self, to entertain Her new felicity! O loyal Pride, Which meek Submission bravely testify'd! 48 Thus through his vast Metropolis, the King Now of her heart, pass'd to his royal Home! Whilst all th'adorned Streets with shouting rung. No Acclamations ever thundred from More earnest Mouths; no Calm of Peace was e'r Welcom'd with such tempestuous Joys, as here. 49 Prudent and tender Phylax, knew that He In both those Titles, nothing could bestow Which in Advantages would richer be To his most precious Pupil's heart, than now To exile every troublous Mist and clear The count'nance of her Habitation's sphere. 50 He knew the worth of Peace; and long ago, When he had left his Charge in Palestine, He hither flew, and order'd business so That all things into Quiet did combine: Yet none could tell it was to entertain Psyche, now ready to return again. 51 But she, arrived at her native Home, Wonder'd to find Security made Queen Of all that Region: vacant was no room For Molestation to be tampering in; Nor any gap left ope, by which she might Thrust in her head, and Settlement affright. 52 Her Friends and Parents much advanc'd this Wonder, When in their cheerly Gratulations they Told her, how Peace had trode all Perils under Her sure-set feet, and puff'd the Storm away. They told it o'r, and o'r; and marvel'd why She turn'd to Phylax her mistrusting eye. 53 Which He observing, to her silent Doubt Made this Reply: suspect no Falsehood here; 'Tis Truth thou seest; a Truth my Care has brought About, to bid thee welcome home, my Dear. Thy Voyage finish'd is; and safely thou May'st in this Hav'n of Rest thy Bark bestow. 54 But see thou rigg'st it still, and keep'st it trim, For fear some treacherous storm hereafter rise: What boots it, stoutly through strange Seas to swim, And poorly prove at home a Tempest's Prize? Safe is the Harbour whilst thy Care awakes: Just Shipwrack sleeping Pilots overtakes. 55 Complete Security dwells in no Bay But that above, to which thine Heart doth sail: There in the Downs of Peace for ever may Thy Vessel ride: but here no Help can bail Thee from the Wind's arrest, if thou forget To aid thy self, and thine own Watches set. 56 O set them then, and bravely antidate The Rest that happy makes the heav'nly Port; Cheap, cheap's the Prize, though at the dearest Rate: O stick not then to pay thus little for't. Thy Life no further than a span can reach; And wilt not thou thus far thy Labour stretch? 57 If thou repent thee of thy bargain, say That with false Wares thy Phylax cheated thee: Throw, boldly throw both them and Me away; And call the Shoar more treacherous than the Sea. Conclude all things but Vanity, are vain, And count Perdition for the only Gain. 58 But surely no such desperate Thought will e'r Debauch the sober heart of Psyche: No; My Hopes are greater of thy holy Care, With which mine own shall be combined too; For as a Guard upon thy Guard will I My wonted Love and Watchfulness imploy. 59 Nor will thy other Soul-embraving Friend Be slow in lending thee her mighty Aid: She who through every Obstacle can rend Her conquering way; She who hath often stay'd Thy tottering feet, and often thee restor'd To thy lost Self, and thy forsaken Lord. 60 Scarce had he spoke; but (as the heav'nly Dew Into Earth's thirsty mouth drops soaking Joy) Right seasonable Charis hither flew, Whose thrilling Influence op'd its dainty way, With most invincibly-delicious art, Through Psyche's soft breast to her softer heart. 61 Nor did her Favor use, or need, her tongue; But spake it self in Psyche's inmost ear; And by soul-plying secret language rung More solid sweets than airy Words could bear: The Virgin understood its meaning well, And hugg'd it in her heart's profoundest cell. 62 (That cell wherein her Life inshrined lay, Which now rose up in pious reverence, And to this royal Guest gave willing way: For what is Grace's blessed Influence, But Life's best Life? and therefore well may in The vital Palace reign as sovereign Queen.) 63 So close she hugg'd it, that it there grew warm, And glow'd so hot, that strait it fell on fire: The sudden flame sounded a smart Alarm Through all her breast, and roused brave Desire: Desire, the other Forces muster'd up; And now no bar her high Design could stop. 64 As when heroick Fervour has awoke A Prince's heart to take a strict Survey Of all his Realm, and Reformation make Of what is swerv'd from Right's and Law's Highway: To his own King, the King of Heav'n, he calls For Aid, and then to his great Bus'ness falls: 65 So entheous Psyche, prostrate on her face, Begs Jesus's help to speed her Enterprise: (For Phylax now by Heav'n admonished was To snatch his Presence from his Pupil's eyes: In prest obedience to which Item, He Fled strait into Invisiblity.) 66 Dear Lord, said she, who never didst reject Thy Worms, which to thy footstool crawl for Aid; Thy Pity on thy Handmaid O reflect, That she by her faint self be not betray'd. Thou, who vouchsaf'd to kindle my Desire, Assist me, least it prove an useless Fire. 67 Well knows thy wronged Majesty, how I The flames Thou giv'st me, oft, too oft, did choke, And sent up no Returns at all to thy Most liberal Heav'n, but black and stinking smoke; Hell's proper breath, and yet as truly mine When to Cerinthus's School I ran from Thine. 68 O trust me not alone; though now my Will Bravely inspired and spurred on by Thee, Aims at a lofty mark; yet Psyche still Is that unfortunate and feeble she Who in her full carreers proves out of breath, And when she soars to Life sinks down to Death. 69 Dear is my Guardian's Company to me: And yet when He is here, I am alone: My soul in no Companion finds but Thee A perfect Cure of Desolation: For I my self, alas, do never stay Ev'n with my self, if Thou but step'st away. 70 But if Thou stay'st, I shall defiance give To any Labour and to any Pain: As oft's mine own do faint, I shall receive New spirits from Thee, and venture on again: Nor shall misfortune cheat me of my Bay, For though I die, I still shall win the day. 71 Yet not for mine, but for thy Grace's, and For thine own Credit, here I crave success: Paid soley to the Praise of thy kind Hand Shall be th'Atchievment's glory: Psyche is Beneath Disgrace, but it in honor do's Concern thy strength no Victory to loose. 72 Up towr'd her Prayer, and knock'd at Jesus's ear; So loud it knock'd, that strait he let it in; In, to his Favor's Presence-chamber, where Their highest Ends all lowly Suters win: Its Embassy was heard, and Jesus granted What Psyche in this noble Business wanted. 73 This bred fresh courage in her soul, and she With doubled Gallantry adventur'd on Her generous Task: Her antient Royalty, Which bold Incroachment oft had trode upon, She meant to rescue, and assert her Crown; Though for her Spouse's sake, more than her own. 74 A general Court she calls, and summons all Her Subjects in, her royal mind to know: Large this Appearence prov'd; both great and small Hasting their prest obedience to show. For, strict the Proclamation was, and they Some special Business did expect that day. 75 No sooner had this Conflux swell'd the Hall Of Psyche's palace, but in princely state Ballast both with her Scepter and her Ball She fairly sails into her sovereign Seat. Up stood the Company, while she sate down, And bow'd their heads to Her's, and to her Crown. 76 How kindly she that joint submission took As Earnest of their several Duties, she Assur'd them first by her welpleased Look, (With which she paus'd a while; for Majesty Must not make haste) then by her softer Tongue, From whence her charming honey thus she wrung: 77 My multiplyed self, my numerous I, In whom as many and as pleasant Lives I live, as each of you enjoy; how high Content to me your loyal Prescence gives, Shall not be now my Theme; it were too long A story, and would do the other wrong: 78 The Other; which, since it would more than fill This Day, (as having cost me several years To travel through it,) I must only tell Part of its Wonders; for against your Ears I plot no tyranny, nor aim to break Them on a tedious Narration's Rack. 79 Through many Climats I have whirled been Safe by the Conduct of my Guardian's Care: The World I in its several Garbs have seen, And how their Clothes and Manners Mortals wear; Fair Cities, foul inhabitants; and sorry Hamlets, yet noble by their Dwellers' Glory. 80 I saw Men live in their outsides alone, Scarce dreaming that within a Soul they had: And yet (because the fashion help'd it on,) A Cloke they wisely of Religion made: A Summer Cloke, so thin and light, that they Ne'r felt it when upon their backs it lay. 81 The crisp'd, perfum'd, belac'd, befooled Wights, Jetting in histrionick Pride I saw; And jolly Cupid's smug salacious Knights Proud of atchieving Virtue's overthrow; With Bacchus's wrangling Squires, whose strange Contest Was, who should prove the best at being Beast. 82 Fondlings I saw their fatal Bane embrace, And loath the Antidote of Piety: I saw true Honor loaded with Disgrace, And humble Zeal disdained by those high And silken Things, who know no way to be Gentile, but Pride and sinful Liberty. 83 I saw severely-holy Souls, the Aim Of lusty Gallants' scorn and peevish Hate; Who threap'd upon their patient heads the Blame Of foolish Singularity; and that Alone because they down the flattering Tide Of deep Damnation would not with them ride. 84 The holier Stories, whence the Holy Land Deriv'd her Name, I by their footsteps read; For many there still deep imprinted stand To give all pious Pilgrims aim, and lead Their hearts in that meek hardy Path, which for Their sakes great Love himself would not abhor. 85 But by that Lesson of Humility Both proud and confident I strangely grew; My own poor waxen wings I needs would try, And wilfully from those stout Pinions flew Which Phylax always for my service spread When sturdy Dangers levell'd at my head. 86 My Wings, alas, did only me commit An helpless booty to the Birds of Prey: With Kites and Vultures strait I was beset, Whose foul heretick Tallons pluck'd away My best and fairest plumes; and hasting were My blood and life with equal spight to tear. 87 But Heav'n and Phylax present pity took, And snatched me from that fatal Company, Up to a Palace whose illustrious Look Revived mine; whose royal Courtesy Gave me more solid precious Things, than those Plunder's wild Law made forfeit to my foes. 88 This was Ecclesia's famous Court; where I Beheld the Miracles of Discipline: No Spectacle e'r blessed mortal eye With Ravishments more sacred and divine; Which on my heart themselves so deep did seal, That there th'Impression must for ever dwell. 89 So sweet a Calm of heav'nly Peace was there, That no Disturbance could its Jars intrude: Which made it genuine Heav'n on Earth appear, All over with harmonious Pleasures strew'd: Each Courtier perfect was in's Office grown, And lov'd it best because it was his own. 90 And happy are those Courts, and none but those, Where wise Content doth in all Stations dwell; Where every Officer, if put to choose, Would only be ambitious to excel In what's his own Imployment, and appear Splendid in none but in his proper sphere. 91 Such welplac'd Beams as theirs, can only be The comely Glory of a Prince's Court. Thus all the prudent Stars above agree To swell and garnish Heav'n's majestick Port: Each orb thus loves his own dear Road, and on His mighty Journy doth with Musick run. 92 Thus those more radiant Sparks which on the face Of th'Empyrean Vastness glittering are, The holy Angels, hug their Orders Place, And wish no nobler Work than meets them there. And who can Us impede, if stoutly We Resolve to model thus our Polity? 93 How lovelyly shine these Examples, which Invite our Study into Honor's way! What Tongue would grudge in its sublimest pitch Of strained Art, to consecrate a Lay Of praise to them? and why should we admire What yet we dare not venture to desire? 94 Foul Shame forbid our Souls should flag so low As ne'r to try one reach at Excellence. Grant it should cost us all a sweating brow; The Gain will more than wipe off that Expence. Ease, Ease alone's the Rust of that brave Metal Which strengthens noble Spirits for Virtue's Battel. 95 No pains so painful are to those who know Their Soul's Activity, as lazy Rest: And on my foes, might I free Curses throw; My worst should be, What Drones esteem the best: No Imprecations would I shoot, but this; And damn them to no Hell but Idleness. 96 Come then, Enacted let it henceforth be, That all our Bows shall to the utmost bend: That generous and hardy Industry Through all our Court her active arms extend: That each one in his proper Office prove How much my Credit, and their own, they love. 97 Though I be Queen, I stick not to submit, And yield my neck to this our common Law: The yoke for Me no less then you is fit; And be assured, I my part will draw. If e'r you see me shrink at any strains, It shall be your Discharge from further pains. 98 But if you winch and kick, and scorn to be Partners with me in your propounded Prize; Know I'm no youngling now; maturity Dwells in my Hand and Brain; well can I poise My Scepter, and have learned how to make Those who disdain to bow, be fain to break. 99 I paid an high price for that Learning, when Crafty Agenor made his market here. And who can blame my Prudence, if I mean To make the most of what has cost so dear? It must and shall appear, how well I know That Kindness makes but Rebels bolder grow. 100 But O! I feel my unaccustom'd Tongue Distaste this threatning stile: for sweetest I Esteem my breath, when melted to a Song In Commendation of your Loyalty. Your Loyalty, which now me thinks, I see Flaming in forward Sacrifice to Me. 101 She ceased here. When lo, on all the Hall A chain of general musing silence lay. Divers suspected that this Law would gall Their necks beyond all Patience: yet they Fearing their Parties votes would prove too weak, Durst not their belking Motions open make. 102 Not with their Tongues: but with their Eyes about The Room they walk'd, and question'd one another; In every look they met both Hope and Doubt, Which mutually their trembling selves did smother; Their shoulders some, and some their heads did shake, Plainly confessing what they fear'd to speak. 103 At length presuming it the safer way Their vessels down the potent stream to steer; They with the rest resolved to Obey, And rather bend than break. Thus thankless fear Of being crush'd by Boreas' wrath, can win The lazy Clouds through widest Skies to run. 104 Thrice bow'd the whole Assembly to the ground, And thrice their Thanks professed to their Prince; Whose Prudence such a certain way had found To yoke her Subjects unto Excellence. And may Rebellion's brand and curse, said they, Mark and revenge all them that Disobey. 105 Thus pass'd the Act: which being fairly writ, High on the middle Pillar of the Hall Was hung, by Psyche's wise Command, that it Might of their Duties daily warn them All. So is the Rod stuck up at School, whose look Awes Children's eyes and points them to their book. 106 But She, to practice what was now Decreed, Begins with them who easiest were to tame; That their Examples useful seeds might breed, A ready stinging Argument of Shame, To lash those Servants who more manly were, If they more weakly should their Task forbear. 107 Her Porters five She called one by one, Their several Instructions now to take. Opsis was first; to whom she thus begun: Though thine high Seat, and sprightful Quickness make Thee ready at Discoveries, yet I Am sharper sighted, and can deeper pry. 108 Believe me then, Thou hast most need to be Jealous of what usurpeth Beauty's skin. Danger is politick, and Treachery Too wise to lodge in a suspicious Inn. The rankest Weeds in richest soils abound, The deepest Holes in smoothest floods are found. 109 That Apple which bewitch'd our Grandame's eyes, Was in Pomona's goodlyest robe array'd; Its plump and ruddy cheeks did sweetly rise, And seeming smiles in all its count'nance play'd; Yet in it's Juice there lurk'd that venomous Sea Which drown'd the World in deep Mortality. 110 Fair were the Grapes to Noah's fearless eye, Nor with less pleasure faund they on his taste: His unsuspecting Heart was also by Their sweet enchantments ravish'd; till at last His treacherous Guest trip'd up his heels, and He Spew'd out confession of the victory. 111 Elisha's servant read no cause of fear In that wild Vine, whose smooth Hypocrisy Woo'd him to fill his mantle with the Cheer Which thus had feasted his wellpleased Eye: Yet cheated Man, he did he knew not what, And shred abundant Death into the pot. 112 Israel's and Wisdom's most renowned King In folly's guilt was plunged by his Eyes; Which in his Queens' bright Beauties rioting, Slyly seduc'd him first to idolize Those female Powers; and then fall down before What he set up, and Stocks and Stones adore. 113 Iscariot's Eyes, when fascinated by Most dangerous Money's gaudy glistering look, No longer could those richer Beams descry Whose pure Exuberance from his Master's broke: But he, blind Traytor, to eternal Night Betray'd himself, in scorning Jesus's Light. 114 That gorgeous fruit which dangled on the Trees That decked Asphaltites's ugly shore, Outvy'd in fragrant Gold th'Hesperides Admired boughs, and more Enticements wore On its smug cheeks: yet all this Statelyness Was but of Ashes and of stinks the Dress. 115 The dainty skin which shines on Beauty's face, Where White's the life of Red, and Red of White, Alas too oft proves but the lovely Case Of odious lust and Pride. The goodlyest Wight Is seldom Good; and hard it is to find Under a splendid look, a graceful mind. 116 Be warey then in time, for fear some Bait Demurely steals an Hook into thine Eye; For fear the Blandishments of sweet Deceit Pour Bitterness on thy Credulity. Security delights in Fear's meek Cell, And scorns in Confidence's Towers to dwell. 117 Thou'lt ne'r repent thee of the easy cost Before thine Eyes a constant Watch to set: Two nimble Lids thou always ready hast, Which, if thou wilt, all Dangers out can shut. Shall it be said, that Opsis means to keep Those Curtains only to inclose her Sleep? 118 When Dinah's Eyes would needs be gadding out, And tracing Hamor's Court; though honest She Only to feed her curious fancy sought, Insnar'd she was in Shechem's Treachery, And, silly Maiden, suddenly became An Holocaust to Lust's unhappy flame. 119 O then indanger not, nor waste thy Look On any Object that concerns thee not: Thy proper Bus'ness is the safest Book On which thy studies can be fixed: but If thou on others cast'st thy venturous eyes, Thou dangerous Errors read'st and Heresies. 120 Thou hear'st thy Task; a Task by which thou may'st Be safe and happy, as my Self would be. So shall thy Tears be useless, when thou hast No Crimes to wash: so shall the Bravery Of thy sweet Beams persist for ever clear, And from Hell's gloomy Fire no outrage fear. 121 The time will surely come, as sure as Fate, Which will this Abstinence of thine requite; When thou shalt freely rove and range through that Ocean of Beauties which make Heav'n so bright. Discredit not with Earthly sights, those eyes Which are design'd to read the glorious skies. 122 The glorious skies; and what makes them be so? That double Fount whence purest Glories rise, The Eyes of Jesus; which on thine shall throw Whole Deluges of everlasting Bliss; When they have done their duty here beneath, And once by Him awakened are from death. 123 But sure that Duty never will be done By dwelling on that Mirrour in thy hands; That brittle Emblem of Corruption, Which though a polish'd sparkling Front commends, It wears unlovely Blackness on its back, And at the mercy lives of every Knock. 124 Opsis this Charge receiv'd with anxious Look, And trembled at its smart severity: That Tremor, from her hand her Mirrour shook; Which falling into its own ruins, she With many a foolish tear its death lamented, And took her leave unwillingly contented. 125 The next was Acoe; who came dancing in, And with her wanton fingers tripped o'r A tickled Lute, in jolly hopes to win The favor of her awful Sovereign; for She felt the pulse of every String to find Where lay the soul of Melody inshrin'd. 126 Grave Psyche, till the Galliard's Close, was mute But then reply'd: now lend thine ear to me, Who will requite thy Layes. I grant thy Lute Cheer'd and encourag'd by Art's bravery, May pant thee Airs more sweet in thy esteem Than any breath which from my lips can stream. 127 But what is Sweetest, is not always Best, And therefore not so sweet as is its Name; Else treacherous Charmers' Pipes must be confest To merit all the loudest Trumps of Fame: Though their delicious Tunes Spight's Hisses be Dissembled under cheating Harmony. 128 Else might th'insidious Sirens' warbling Note Vie with the Accents of the Nightingale; Although no barbarous Tempest's bellowing throat Did with more certain Peril e'r assail The Mariner; unless with timely Care Against her Musick up he seal'd his ear. 129 Else were th'Hyæna, who with friendly tone Demurely knocketh at the simple door, As courteous as his Salutation, Though in his breast he bloody Treason bore; And that false Mouth which them bespake so fair Prepared were the silly Lambs to tear. 130 Else should the Parasite, whose trade it is To feed and clothe himself by Praising thee And stroaking all thy rankling Wickedness: Be thy more useful faithful Friend, than He Who for thy breeding Canker's sure prevention Applies the Corsive of sound Reprehension. 131 Else should Agyrtes's honey-tipped Tongue Of ears and hearts more meritorious be, Than is th'unstudied and harsh-grating Song Of plain Syneidesis: though dangerous He Speaks nothing but the Dialect of Hell, Whilst trusty She doth vocal Heav'n distil. 132 Remember Acoe with what oily words The Serpent ointed Eve's imprudent ears: Yet all the Syllables were two-edg'd swords, Longbearded Arrows, or envenom'd Spears; Which flew not only through her careless heart, But wounds and Death through all the world did dart. 133 That Serpent marking what himself had done, Wisely applyd it to his own Defence: So did his cunning Generation, Who stop their ears against the Influence Of soft Enchantments. And it can be no Disgrace, to learn a Virtue of a Foe. 134 Had Delilah's Tongue not been so musical, It ne'r had ventur'd upon Samson's might; Nor in his chamber conquer'd more than all Philistia's Powers could do in open sight. But when the sturdiest Bands were try'd in vain, Her supple Language prov'd his fatal Chain. 135 Puff'd with Heav'n-daring Pride and Victory Great Holofernes fear'd no dint of Fear; When walled in with his vast Army, He Vow'd Jacob's Stock up by the roots to tear. Yet Judith's glozing Tongue his Boasts outdid; For having won his Ears, she gain'd his Head. 136 O then thine Avenues let Prudence shut When worldly Charms are tuning Falshood's strings: Be deaf, and happy; rather than admit Those traiterously-melodious Flourishings; Which stealing once into thy heart, will there With everlasting Jars thy Conscience tear. 137 The Voice of Truth, though seeming plain and dry, Flows with more honey than all Tongues beside: With Honey so sincere, that Purity It self in those sole streams delights to glide. Securely may'st thou be Luxuriant here, Nor any Surfeit from this Fulness fear. 138 Thus shalt thou never need to hunt abroad For News, the Bait by which Fools mock their hunger; Who when most fill'd with this most empty food Find their abused Appetite the stronger. Well may'st thou other Novelties refuse For now, alas, ev'n Truth it self is News. 139 Let others slander't with the name of Pride, I'l stile it Virtue in thee, to disdain That Foam of useless Prattle, which doth ride Upon the idely-busy tongues of vain And shallow Mortals; who though all the day They spin out long Discourses, Nothing say. 140 Scorn light fond Accents, and reserve thine Ear For those which solid Musick's sweets distil; Years post about apace: the Time draws near, When thou exalted on Heav'n's glistering Hill With those rich Notes shalt entertained be, Whose Comfort makes the spherick melody. 141 My Guardian's blessed Voice there shalt thou hear, And all the winged Quire, whose sprightful Tongues Blisses and Honors, joys and triumphs cheer, By lofty raptures of their entheous Songs: Songs, which must ne'r inebriate any Ear But what were sober kept on purpose here. 142 On Acoe so hard this Lesson grated, That in her heart she wish'd she had been deaf: And, since their old Rebellion was defeated, She fear'd the Senses could have no Relief By any new: full well she knew beside Who most should feel it when her Queen did chide. 143 She groan'd, and let her Lutestrings down as though Those of her heart with them she loosned had: And then, O sweetest Womb of Pleasures, how Shall Acoe live, said she, now thou ly'st dead! With that, she fetch'd her Musick's funeral sigh, And kiss'd her Lute, and gently laid it by. 144 Then Osphresis came in; who in one hand Courted a Civit box, and in the other A Nest of Rosebuds built upon a Wand Of Juniper, and quaintly knit together. Which Psyche seeing, Court it warily, Roses wear Pricks as well as Leaves, said she. 145 Could all the Balm of Gilead, all the spice Of happy Araby, inform thee how To counterplot those fatal Miseries Whose certain Seeds in thine own bosom grow; I could approve such Helps: but they, as frail And mortal as thy self, thy hopes will fail. 146 Alas, so deep Corruption rooted is Ev'n in the center of thy fading breast; That Odours spend their breath in vain to dress The tainted Soil. How largely 'tis confest By all the former Ages Ashes, that Mortality on Man is seal'd by Fate! 147 And shall the Son and true apparent Heir Of Rottenness mispend his time upon Unprofitable Sweets, by which the Air Is for a while inrich'd and that alone? Sweets which each silly Wind that whisketh by, Snatcheth, and scattereth, in proud mockery. 148 Why should'st thou studious be to make the Prey Of stinking Worms, so sweetly dainty? why Affect'st thou on perfumed beds to lay Thine head, which must e'r long a-rotting lie? Why should'st thou with such curious cost and trouble Conspire Corruption's victory to double? 149 Wer't not a cheaper and a wiser Plot, Aforehand with displeasant smiles to grow Acquainted; that the brackish Grave may not By being strange to thee, the bitterer show? Besides; Perfumes, Contagions may be With Delicacies' Bane infecting thee. 150 Howe'r, thou usest not those Odours which So much thou usest: others nostrils reap The crop of Sweets thou plantedst, and grow rich At thy vain charge; whilst thou dost only keep To please thy Neighbours' smell, thy powder'd Tresses, And preciously-aromatized Dresses. 151 O Osphresis, that thou didst truly know What fields of Fragrances, what beds of spice, What hills of Roses, plains of Spiknard grow In fair and eververdant Paradise; Thou generously would'st scorn to dote upon Earth's poor Perfumes, which whilst they come are gone. 152 Yet all the purest names of Odours are Short of that soul-enlivening Incense which From Heav'n's high Altar pyramides doth rear Of Suavity, and Bliss it self inrich. O then reserve thy Sense, for that which will Its Fast with all the best of Fulness fill. 153 And yet mean while I will to thee allow, More worthy Sweets, than those thou throw'st away, In Virtue's garden do but walk, and Thou Shalt meet such spicey Breaths of holy Joy As will compell thy ravish'd soul to think, This World's gentilest sent, but precious stink. 154 Such Breaths, as will perfume thy heart indeed, And all thy Thoughts and Words aromatize; Until their odorous Emanations breed Delight in God's own nostrils; who doth prize All pious Incense, only by the sent Of its meek Sacrificers pure Intent. 155 So spake the Queen: whose words, though soft and sweet As is the morning blast of eastern Gales, Seem'd strong and rank to Osphresis; who beat Her foolish thoughts on present Hills and Dales Of fragrant wealth, which she desir'd to crop, Being loth to live on that cold sent of hope. 156 Deep sighing, she thrice on her Civet, and Thrice on her smiling Posy smelt; but yet At length she drop'd them out of either hand, Perceiving Psyche's awful Count'nance set With Resolution; and no longer stout, As Geusis marched in, she trembled out. 157 But Psyche, prompted by the honey Comb Which Geusis hug'd, thus 'gan the maid to greet: What if that Nest of Sweetness hath no room For any thing that is intirely sweet? What if the Bee hath in that Cabinet More of her Sting, than of her Honey put? 158 Hard, hard it is, to eat no more than may True friendship keep 'twixt Safety and Delight: The least Excess will thee to Pangs betray, And break thy Work by day, thy Rest by night. Indeed a surfeit goes like Honey down, But strait with Gall the heart is overflown. 159 How ravenous is the mouth of Mars his Sword, Vast Armies swallow'd up by it, confess: Yet Luxury with sharper Stings is stor'd; Her throat's devouring Gulf much wider is: No reeking Steel thou ever yet didst see Blush in the guilt of so much blood, as She. 160 We wrong, alas, we wrong the bloody Paws Of Lyons, Panthers, Tigres, Bears, and Wolves; Yea and the direful Plague's relentless Jaws, By calling them most salvage: We our Selves More deadly Plagues, and Beasts more cruel are; For our own Lives with our own Teeth we tear. 161 Of his Sobrieties sage stayed weight Had great Belshazzar not been cozen'd by The cruel Sweets of Luxury's Deceit; He had not in Heav'n's scale of Equity Been found so light, as by Darius down From his high Empires Zenith to be blown. 162 Of her in time had Dives taken heed, When in each Dish for him she lay in wait, When into every Boul her self she shed, When each superfluous Bit she made a Bait; In Hell the wretched Gallant had not lain Acting poor Lazarus his part in vain. 163 His broiled Tongue had not so earnest been In lamentable Outcries, to obtain No crowned Cups of lusty foaming Wine, But one cold drop of Water, to restrain Those rampant Flames which with luxuriant spight Reveng'd his former Luxuries' Delight. 164 But Lazarus, whose meek ambition was No more than with this Glutton's Dogs to be A Commoner; into the sweet Embrace Of Abraham, and of Felicity Mounted, on Angels' pinions towr'd, and there Injoy'd a fuller Feast than Dives here. 165 Wise Saint, his stomack he had sav'd, that he With a full Appetite might thither go Where sumptuous Dainties hold their Monarchy, And purest Pleasures by whole Rivers flow. And if Thou after Him desir'st to climb, Be sure to trace his footsteps here in time. 166 I know the Boards of many holy Souls In Fatness often have been seen to shine; On which their golden overflowing Bouls Leap'd up in sparks of aromatick Wine: But canst thou say, That they themselves did so? Surely their Looks and Lives will tell thee No. 167 This constant Plenty did but keep them close To temperance's manlyest Exercise; And difficultest Virtues' list they chose When to their Boards they went, to play the prize Of Abstinence, and, by forbearing, fight With those arrayed Armies of Delight. 168 Heroick Hearts! who though beleaguered by A siege of Superfluity, could yet Mantain chaste Moderation. But thy Metal and temper, Geusis, are not fit To wage war with temptations: no, 'tis well If thou by flying canst thy Safety steal. 169 To sparing Diet fly: there may'st thou eat And drink thine Health; but never in Excess. Excess makes Sickness reek in all thy meat; And with thy Liquor, Surfeits treason press Into thy Cup; by which before thou art Aware, thy Head is drowned, chok'd thy Heart. 170 But fasting's vertue never fails to be A sovereign Purge where vicious humours reign; Whilst other Physick drains thy Purse, not Thee, This plots not to evacuate thy Coin; But battle bids, and bids to none but those Who are thy Body's or thy Spirit's foes. 171 This will prepare, and keep thy Taste in taste, Till this short Eve shall be exspired, which Ushers thee to that everlasting feast, Where at the Lamb's most royal Board the rich Extremities of Delicacies will More than thy mouth, yea or thy wishes fill. 172 And since thou know'st thy Duty; likewise know I love thee better than to let thee 'scape Severest censure, if thou swervest now From this fair Path which leads to Blisse's Top; And with such ballast stuff'st thy self, as will If Heav'n prevent not, lag thee down to Hell. 173 Close all this while her Comb had Geusis held; But this last Word's smart dint prevail'd to smite It from her quaking hand: at which she swell'd With sullen sadness, and began to bite Her lips: but marking then stern Psyche's eye, She bow'd her head and made her will comply. 174 Scarce was she out; but mincing Haphe came, Whose hands were in a Muff of Sables drown'd; Her Body wantonized in a frame By Ease's measure made, a Robe, which round With silken softness courted her: no Pin Nor Seam presum'd to touch her dainty skin. 175 The sight made Psyche smile: And what, said she; If that soft furniture grow thick with Pricks? If harshest Hair or sackcloth, gentler be, Which close and strait on hardy Bodies sticks? Alas the Wounds of Silk more dangerous far Than those of sharpest Swords and Arrows are. 176 Such Weapons' Wounds can never further sink Than to the Bodie's bottom; but a proud Attire doth sadly soak the Soul, and drink Its best blood up; nor knows she how to shroud Her self from this mishap so long as she Builds inward Joys on outward Bravery. 177 Potiphera was deeper wounded by The delicacies of her soft array, Then Joseph by his Chains' austerity Whose iron load eat ope a cruel way Through skin and flesh: her wounds did her destroy, His cur'd their earthly Pain with Heav'nly Joy. 178 Thou know'st in what a Soft and curious Dress Madam Herodias danced down to hell: Whilst reverend John, array'd in Simpleness, Did proudlyest-decked Mortals so excel, That, though in Herod's Court despised, yet Plain as he was, he into Heav'n's was let. 179 Had'st thou beheld his homespun Camel's hair, And leathern Thong; how would thy quaint and new Fashions, thy Lawns, thy Silks, thy Sables dare Their cowardly effeminate face to shew? Would not thy worthless Skin have blush'd to see It self in fairer Robes then glorious He. 180 What ugl[i]er Sight can Fancy's storehouse show, Than goodly-formed Man disfigured by Strange garbs and cuts; and madly bent to grow More handsom than himself! what Vanity Of Pride so foolish, as for man to aim A comelyer fashion than his God to frame! 181 Thou in Life's scene hast but one Part to play, Why like a thousand things then art thou drest? Why art thou big and rufling loose to day, To morrow spruce and slender? if the best Garb be thy Wish, the Best can be but one: Why dost thou woo them all, yet weddest none? 182 O could'st thou see that course and rural Suit The wise Creator did for Adam make; How would it thy vain Gallantry confute, Who all the world's best Dainties up would'st rake Thy vulgar Carcase, to array, when He In Leather goes who's King of Earth and Sea! 183 God's Copy satisfy'd the Saints of old, Who sought no further than Goats or Sheep For Skins, in which they might their own infold: A rude Plantation this; yet hence they reap A royal Harvest, and bedeck'd in fair Robes of immortal Glory glittering are. 184 No beds of wanton Down desired They Wherein to loose themselves; but were content In Dens and Caves their manly heads to lay; Where they to Rest with fuller comfort went Than pompous lusty Solomon, when he Climb'd up his couch of stately Ivory. 185 Nor e'r was't known that precious Pearl would lie In any Shells but wondrous course and plain; That any search could Gold and Silver spy But nestled in some dark and dirty Vein: That briskest sparks of fire would choose their rest But in some black rude Flint's unlikely breast. 186 I grant that now distinct Degrees require Such Garbs as may their Dignity proclaim: Not that they by their outside beams aspire To gaudy foolish Glory; for their aim Is only by this necessary Art Their Place's proper honor to assert. 187 Else Man's perversly-blear and peevish Eye Would find a way how not to be aware Of what dread Lustre flames in Majesty; Or that the Sacerdotal Temples are With venerable Privileges crown'd, Which from their Function's Sanctity redound. 188 This made Heav'n's Ordination of old The consecrated Body of the Priest With reverence-commanding Gems and Gold, And finest Linen's Purity invest. But what's all this to Thee, whose private State All Helps of publick Dignity may bate? 189 My peremptory Pleasure therefore 'tis That Thou thy fittest Patterns copy out: Since thou delighted art with Tenderness, Be Tender of thy Bliss; and never doubt But that will softer prove, and warmer be Than are thy Wishes and that Muff to thee. 190 This said; she spake her Expectation by Her serious Looks which darted Haphe through With servile dread, and summon'd off her eye Which hankered upon her Fur till now. Sad was the foolish Maid, she knew not why, Being only chid from tickling Misery. 191 For full as loth as that Beast's back which wore The furry skin at first, did part with it, She let her hand drop down her Muff before Her Sovereign's foot, and made her head submit. But yet she shrunk her shoulders, and betray'd How sad a load she counted on them laid. 192 Psyche, her Cinque-Ports being thus secured, For Glossa call'd; who cheerfully came in, And with a thousand Complements allured The kind Opinion of her frowning Queen: But thou mistak'st, said she, in reck'ning by Thy numerous Complements thy Loyalty. 193 Truth's quickly said; for pure unspotted she Delights in her own genuine Nakedness, And scorns that ceremonious Bravery Which Flattery's Deformity doth dress. Dull Wood alone needs Vernice; radiant Gems Are brave in their own native naked beams. 194 Much Talk is either stretched out by Lies, Which poison all the streams wherein they flow; Or tricked up with pritty Vanities, Which like fond Ribands, serve but for a show, And catch Spectators' eyes, but tie not that Which they embrace with their close-fauning Knot. 195 The idle Froth which plays upon the face Of troubled Waters, swelleth not with Wind So pitifully slight and empty, as Is that which bubbles from a royled Mind; When, overflowing Wisdom's sober brims, In drunken Prattle on the Lips it swims. 196 As is thy neighbor Geusis apt to be Luxurious by too much Taking in; So thou the hazard run'st of Gluttony By Pouring out: if once thy Lips begin To give the Reins to Words, thou in profound Intemperance wilt suddenly be drown'd. 197 Silence, her Master never did undo; But O how guilty is Multiloquie Of this unnatural Treason! Nature, who The danger spy'd by Providence's eye, Was studious this mischief to prevent When thee a ready double Guard she lent. 198 The outer are thy Lips; which though they be But soft and tender, yet their two-leav'd Door So close they shut, that not the first Degree Of Words, not Breath it self has power to bore Its path, but silently must tack about And through the Nose's sluces wrestle out. 199 The inner, are those Ranks of Ivory, which Right strongly barracado up thy way: To sally out in vain thy Murmurs itch, Unless the Passage fondly these betray. 'Tis no hard task for thee to rest in peace, Who strengthned art by two such Guards as these. 200 Before thou speakest, thou art Queen alone, And freely may'st command and rule thy thought: But thou to foreign Jurisdiction Surrendrest it, when Words have blown it out: For strait 'tis subject to the cruel Laws Of every Auditor's censorious Jaws. 201 When leave thou giv'st to other Tongues to walk, They travel for thy gain: if wise he be Who speaks, thou learnest Wisdom by his Talk; If fond, thou reapest from his Vanity A wholsom warning: but when e'r thy Cock Alone doth run, thou spendest on the Stock. 202 Fear no Discredit by Pauciloquie: All Jesus's footsteps high and noble are; Never was stripped Sheep more mute than He, His humane fleece when Spight inhumane shore. And if the Word himself was not ashamed Of Silence, can it in the Tongue be blamed? 203 Nay dullest Fools, when they their Lips contained, Have often purchas'd Wisdom's reputation; Whilst greatest Clarks who rashly have unreined Their prancing Tongues, from their own Credit's station By their unruly venturous Coursers down The Precipices of Contempt are thrown. 204 What will it boot thee to inhance that score Of debts thou ow'st the dreadful Judge; since thou A strict account must render up before His throne, of all the stragling words that flow From thee in vain? Why, why wilt thou to death Be sentenced by thine own lavish Breath? 205 Improve it rather in an holy Thrift, And make it up to Heav'n thy Prayers blow; Or Hallelujahs thither let it lift; And not, like wanton Gales, play here below. But if thou needs wilt idely prattle, I Must deal in earnest with thy Vanity. 206 No word to this, check'd Glossa could reply, But look'd demurely, and obeysance did: Her conge to withdraw, in Psyche's eye And in her Nod, no sooner had she read; But out she meekly went, and left the room Free for the Passions now thither come. 207 As these in order stood before the Throne, With earnest Looks the Queen first aw'd them, and Then thus began: Now you are here alone, I am content to let you understand How you I prize, so long as you can be What Heav'n has made you, to your selves and Me. 208 Of all the Commons who allegiance owe To this my Crown, I you the noblest count; More quick, more generous Service you can show Than those whose highest faculties can mount But to exterior grosser things, which are Lab'ring in Sensibilitie's dull sphere. 209 On your fleet backs I can far higher flie, And with more speed, than on the Senses' wings: But you I welcome bid, or I defie The tribute which to me their Service brings. You are the lovely Mirrour which presents My Disposition's truest lineaments. 210 The inward Body of the Soul are you, The outside of the hidden Heart: all springs Which there peep up, learn openly to flow In your free chanels; and th'abstrusest things Which in the Mind's dark Temper nuzling lie, By you exposed are to every eye. 211 But as your native strength and worth is high, So is the Guilt of your Extravagance: Though Worms, the Sons of vile Dirt, mudling lie In their Dames' bosom, they do not inhance Their Baseness: but should Birds be groveling there, The sordid Crime unnatural would appear. 212 Be then but truly what you are, and flie In your own sphere: so you shall surely meet Together with your own Felicity, My Love and Praise: damp not that generous heat Whose embers in your veins desire to flame Into the Lustre of eternal Fame. 213 Love, know thy self, and own an holy Pride; Thine Arms were not made pliant, to embrace Such low ignoble Joys as can abide Beasts for their Owners: never then disgrace The gallantry of thy illustrious wings By hankering here about vile earthly Things. 214 Though to Humility's submissive Law Thou art sworn Subject; yet thine Aim may be At Excellency's lofty crest: for know That Meekness Jesus's steps may trace, and He Through deep Contempt's black Valley towred up To God's right hand, and Glory's brightest Top. 215 Virtue, and Heav'n (the soil whence first it sprung) Exposed are to thee a royal Prey: If rotten Earth can more allurements bring, More worth, more satisfaction, than they; Pour scorn upon them, and thy self apply To hug the Pleasures of Mortality. 216 The great Adventures of all Saints deride, Who spent their lives those Prizes to obtain; And bless fond Wantons, who swum down the Tide Of these short Sweets, into that Gulf of Pain Where endless Horrors boil, and where ev'n Love It self is changed, and doth Hatred prove. 217 But ne'r may'st Thou prove so, most noble Thou, The privileged and selected she, Who, whilst thy Sisters all are fain to row In some shore-girted measurable Sea, Into Infinitude may'st lanch, and there Thy endless Course without all Compass steer. 218 Fear, be not thou afraid to know thy Part: 'Tis not to quake at any Powers which Hell Or Earth can arm against thy jealous Heart: Those Tempests all are chain'd, nor can they swell Higher than his more lofty Hand will yield, Which always out is stretch'd to be thy Shield. 219 See'st thou that single Hair, which shivering lies Upon thy breast, and dreads the mildest Wind? Were all th'Aereal Principalities In one sworn knot of Violence combin'd, 'Twould pose their Might and Wit to tear it thence, If checked by that Hand of Providence. 220 Thy duty is, to tremble at the sight Of that foul Monster which makes Hell so black; Sin's face alone is that which needs affright Thy tenderest Eyes; a Face, whose dint can rack The Basilisks with pois'nous torture, and All Dragons' fiery Souls with terror rend. 221 Yet if thy Wilfulness will not attend The frightfulness of that most dismal look; View but the Horrors of a Cursed End, And make Eternal flames a while thy Book: There shalt thou read what will deserve to be With ghastly Dread contemplated by thee. 222 And in this shaking fit, shalt thou admire What madness makes fond Mortals quake so much At fortune's frowns, or at a Prince's ire; Yet never fear the wrath of Vengeance; which Inrag'd by Brimstone in the burning Pit, Gapes wide for All, who, slighting, merit it. 223 But when with soft and gentle Tremor thou Would'st sweetly exercise thy self; apply Thy reverent Thoughts to Him whose sovereign brow Adorns the Crown of highest Majesty. So will thy God his eyes to thine incline; Which on thy heart with dainty Awe will shine. 224 And Thou, stern Hatred, as relentless be As Rocks, or Souls of Tigres in thy spight: But see the dart of this thy Cruelty Miss not its proper Butt: thine only fight With Sin's bold troops must be; on which accurst And dangerous Enemy do, do thy worst. 225 All other foes, how fell soe'r, belong To Love's vast Jurisdiction; for She Knows how revenge to take on any Wrong By drowning it in mighty Charity. Thy Wrath is sharp, but hers is gentle; Thou With steel dost break, but She with Warmth doth thaw. 226 Be warey then to guide thy stroke aright, For close the Sin and Sinner linked are; Least when thou aim'st against the Crime, thy fight, Unto the Person thou extend'st thy war. The Person's God's, who nothing hates which he Hath made, and therefore will not suffer Thee. 227 Hope, lavish not thy fruitless Expectation On any birth this World's womb forth can bring: Why should'st thou dance attendance on vexation, On wind, on froth, on shadows vanishing In their original; and gape to be Replenished with meer Vacuity? 228 On fulness rather wait, and lift thine Eye, Thy longing eye, to Heav'n, in which it dwells. Far off indeed the Object is, but thy Discerning Power, at distance most excels. Be brave and confident, thou can'st not miss A mark so ample and so fair as this. 229 Since Absence nothing is to mystick Thee But its bare name (for to thy reaching eye The thing is present, though it hidden be In darkest bosom of futurity.) O turn fruition; antidate thy Bliss, And climb aforehand into Paradise. 230 But thou, tart Anger, never hunt abroad For meat to please thy washpish appetite: Home will supply thee with sufficient food To fatten thee with solid true Delight. What faults soever thou espyest here, Fall to and make thee merry with the cheer. 231 Thy useful Self why should'st thou strive to be In others' bosoms, rather than thine own? Wrath's arrows seldom fly aright, when she Levels against a foreign Mark her frown: Her Archery is surest practiz'd on The Buts of her domestick Sins alone. 232 No less to Thee, pale thoughtful Jealousy Belongs this Item: Let no vain surmise Of others' bus'ness breed perplexity In thine; but inward turn thy prying eyes, And give the reins to thy suspicion here In any thing which looks not sound and clear. 233 I grant thee leave, ev'n not to spare thy Queen; Be diligent, and if thou wilt, severe: For sure if thou such heretofore had'st been, Immured safe in never-sleeping fear Psyche had dwelt, and not been conquer'd by The charms of Lust, and fouler Heresy. 234 Yet Sorrow, thou thy fears may'st safely spend On alien and on publick Mischiefs; thou May'st help Compassion freely to extend Her reaching bowels, and her bounty show In sympathetick tenderness to all Whom tyrannous Disasters hold in thrall. 235 Provided, all thy store thou pour'st not forth To quench thy Neighbours' flames, but stor'st up some To wash out those sad stains which from thy birth Have daily multiplyed here at home. These, these, deserve them: but no drop shalt thou On any temporal Cross of mine bestow. 236 O no! a Tear's a nobler thing than so, Nor must be squander'd in such vain expence. No oriental Pearls, though married to Richest Embroideries, shew such pretence To Beauty, as those precious Beads, whose Mine Lives in the fertile womb of humane Eyn. 237 Let wanton Fortune take her proud delight In trampling on what Error Goods doth call: A name which mocks the Thing, whose frail and slight Being at Change's beck must rise and fall. Let her insult; why should thy Tears flow down For fortune's faults, and not lament thine own? 238 Joy, thou hast hitherto too careless been In distribution of thy lavish Smiles: What is't to thee, if fields abroad are green; If Plenty with her Bliss thy coffers fills; If any thing without thee prospers, when Thou poor, and parch'd, and barren art within: 239 If thou at home canst nothing worthy find Of just applauding Notice; no brave feat Of resolute Virtue, no soul-plying Wind Of Heav'n's great Spirit, no adventurous Heat Of holy Love: alas, thy Merriment Is but th'Hypocrisy of Discontent. 240 'Tis but a shaddowy dreaming Pleasure, which May float and play in thy fantastick brain, But ne'r can to thy bosom's region reach Which still beclouded is with pensive pain. Yea ev'n thy laughter with deep wrinkles plows Thy face, and in thy Mirth Care's Visage shows. 241 In smiling Wine let rampant Roarers brue The Quintessence of their lymphatick mirth: Let idleness's busy Sons persue Pleasure through thousand Sports; in tedious Earth Let Muckworms delve, and grope, Content to gain: What's that to thee, if they will sweat in vain? 242 In God alone, and what of Him in thy Meek loyal Soul thou find'st, fix thy delight; And then walk out; yet only to descry What hearts pant Heav'n like thine; that only sight Abroad, deserves thou should'st Spectator be; All else, with Grief suit better than with Thee. 243 And you the rest, whose near attendance on My royal Person equally requires Exact and generous Duty; see you run Not on the errands of your own Desires, But mine; which should be yours: and know, that I Much better than your selves can you employ. 244 So shall our Kingdom with such Peace be blest As no intrusion of storms shall fear. So of your selves you all shall be possest And reign in your own bounds, as I do here. So no Agenor shall again intice You to Conspire to your own Miseries. 245 But if you scorn to walk in Honor's way (Which way is, Doing what becomes you best) Yet must not I permit you to betray, Your own Capacity of Welfare. Is't Your Lot or Office here to Govern? No; Your Queen her power better knows than so. 246 She ending here: the Passions each on other Cast cowardly-couragious glances: for, Though loth their itching Waywardness to smother, These strict injunctions griped them so sore, Yet none such venturous metal had, as up To lead their belking Stomacks' forlorn Hope. 247 Then vex'd at one another's faintness, they Hung down their sheepish look, and bent their knees In token they were ready to obey Their Queen's, however new and strange, Decrees; And so in peevish shame went blushing out That they into Subjection's Guilt were brought. 248 For those whose Palats ne'r were taught to taste The piercing Sweets of Holy Discipline, By wilful Licence's mad Revels cast Their fond Accounts of freedom, and repine At any chains, although they keep them in From rushing to the slavery of Sin. 249 Psyche observ'd how they this serious Bit Into their mouths like sullen Horses took; How mutinously they foam'd and champed it, And in their hearts the Reins aforehand broke. This made her instantly resolve to ride Them hard, and weary out their lusty Pride. 250 Not theirs alone; but her chaf'd Senses too, Whom their new Laws had almost Passions made, So hard their stubborn necks they grated, so Straitly they ty'd them to a sourer trade Than e'r they drove before, or than they had Observ'd professed by the World abroad. 251 She by a Peremptory brave Decree Enacted Scorn of every thing which here The Tempter makes a bait to Luxury, Pride, Avarice, or any Crimes which bear Chief rule in mortal Hearts, whilst heedless they Mark not the Hook ev'n when they are its Prey. 252 A general Proclamation then she made That none who to her Scepter homage owe In any case presume abroad to gad; Unless Necessity were seen to go As their Companion; who might limits set Both to their Walk, and what they did in it. 253 Nor would now Prudence her commission seal To any Judge's serious eye, to see Due execution of her Laws; for well She knew, that to her self her own would be Most true and trusty: and she vowed here To prove her self as Watchful as Severe. 254 As when an headstrong Torrent, wont to throw His lawless arms on every Mead where he Listed to riot, is injoyn'd to flow In some strait Chanel's Regularity; The stream with belking indignation beats, And foams against the Banks with murmuring threats: 255 So with high-swelling self-tormenting Wrath Her Subjects pent in these new narrow bounds, Impatiently rebel against their Path, And every one his fretful grief expounds In long long commentaries of Complaint: The only freedom of their close Restrant. 256 Were other Subjects yok'd so strait as We, Their Company would lighter make our yoke; For Misery spread in Community Abates the terror of her cruel look. But how, said they, shall we support alone This mountainous load of Persecution! 257 If 'twere the fashion any where beside, For Sense and Passion thus in chains to lie; Our Souls it would not torture to be ty'd In patternable slavery: but why Must all the World laugh at our Woes, whilst We The sole Examples of this Bondage be? 258 Psyche, who all their strugling Murmurs heard With awful Majesty inflam'd her eye: And, Come, said she, if I must needs be fear'd, Who would much rather have been loved by My Subjects; be it so: for know, that still Keep you intirely Such I must and will. 259 Yet since the fashion's all your Plea, and you As singular have tax'd your present State; Observe I pray how amply I allow You your own wish: but see you kick not at My royal love, nor force me to the fashion Which Princes use in Rebels' Insultation. 260 The noble Mode which I have put you in, Is that which made the Saints of old so fine; That they the eyes of Heav'n it self could win, And ravish All but those to whom divine And earth-despising Beauty dimmer seems Than pallid Gold's and glaring Silver's beams. 261 Yea, that illustrious Realm whose situation Lies higher than the Stars, has no disdain At that which you repute a servile fashion: For every Angel his own will doth chain Close to his Sovereign's Law, and never flies Abroad, but when his pinions That employs. 262 Tell me not then what Garbs and Humors are By this blind foolish World ador'd; but take Your Copy from those Patterns which outdare The worth of any Parellel; and make Those men your Pity, who make you their scorn: Your fashion gorgeous is, but theirs forlorn. 263 These words with such convincing horror flew Upon the faces of the mutinous Rout, That all their Murmurs' Blasts away they blew; Calming the storms which in their bosoms wrought. And now their Stoutness nothing had to say, Nothing remain'd to do, but to obey. 264 So when the stubborn Colt has kick'd, and flung And tryed his rebellious strength in vain, Finding his stomack and his neck too young To grapple with his skilful Rider's Rein; To strong Necessity he giveth place, And melteth into an obedient pace. 265 Thus from exterior Troubles sequestred, Close to her private bus'ness Psyche fell; She, long before the Sun sprung out of bed, And call'd it morning, e'r the East could tell Aurora dressing was; for I, said she, Have fiercer Steeds to rule than Titan's be. 266 Then, higher in to Heav'n, than he can roll His wheels, she leap'd; so stout and sinewy were Her early Mattens; which carreerd her Soul Up to the pinacle of Glory; where Praises and Prayers in a flood before Her Spouse's footstool she of course did pour. 267 Her hands then letting down, she set them to Their second Task; and hasted to prepare Clothes for the Orphans and the Widows, who By generous Charitie's Adoption were Become her Children: thus did prudent She Nobly make fruitful her Virginity. 268 And from this voluntary Offspring She Reap'd pure delight: for they who Parents are By Nature's Help, too oft engaged be In their unnatural Brood's vexatious Care: But she from her's no Discontent could find, Being the chosen Children of her mind. 269 Yet with her Work, her Prayers she so enchas'd That she of both a goodly checker made: For through her pious hands no bus'ness pass'd, But Heav'n she enterwove; her constant trade Was but a faithful Prenticehood to Him Whose royal Temples wear Heav'n's Diadem. 270 So though the mariner with busy Care Waits on his Card, yet oft he lifts his eye To drink direction from that trusty Star Which darteth on his Voyage, Certainty; And by this mixed study safely rides Over the proudest and the furthest Tides. 271 Never could She find leisure to attend On ceremonious Idelness, nor by The civil speciousness of Visits spend Her precious Time on courteous Vanity. Wealth against Wealth she never meant to try, Nor bandy Feasts, or Entertainments vy. 272 Yet painful Bus'ness her abroad could draw, And wheresoe'r the sick despised Poor Lay succourless, she by the Gospel Law Her self accounted summon'd to restore Her needy Lord that tender help which she Had oft receiv'd from his Benignity. 273 For Him on all those languid Beds she saw; His pained broken limbs, His parched skin, His burning Tumours, His black stripes, His raw And gaping Wounds: and these so strongly won On her Compassion, that her own they proved, Whilst her soft bowels them both felt and loved. 274 The odious Sores which would have loathing bred Ev'n in the Surgeon's eyes, she gladly view'd; Her choicest Plasters pleasantly she spread, And all her Powders with delight she strewed. Her self she robbed of her Clothes to wind About the Naked, and the maimed bind. 275 By their Diseases height she joy'd to measure The worth of such distressed Company: The foulest Lepers yielded choisest pleasure To her Attendance; who aspir'd to be Chief Servant unto those whose noisom stench Could Parents love and Childrens duty quench. 276 In vain her Senses turn'd their nauseous head, Since she resolv'd to love what they abhorr'd: In vain her dainty Passions murmured, And Logos too with some Dislike was stirred: Her Resolution she the more professed, And ever Kiss'd the Sores which she had dressed. 277 The coy-ey'd Ladies, with a squeamish look, Admir'd and loath'd her lowly Complement: Not for a world would their fine Fingers brook The touch of what they saw her Lips resent As soft and sweet: yet could not their Disdain Her Kisses most courageous zeal restrain. 278 She still her merciful Design persues, And by divine Insinuation tries How in her Potions she may Heav'n infuse, And reach the soul's mysterious Maladies. Heart-startling Hints she sprinckles here and there, And poures in holy Cordials every where. 279 Nor by this paradoxick Zeal alone Did she run counter to the World's carreer; But valiant in her high Devotion, Adventur'd further yet to domineer Over her Flesh and Blood; whose lusty heat Down flat by Abstinence she meant to beat. 280 Wherefore no set and customary Time Tempted her to unnecessary Meat; But earnest Hunger always toll'd the chime Which smartly her admonished to eat. And then her Meal she would not measure by Her stomachful, but bare sufficiency. 281 And thus did she her Food her Servant make, Whilst others, slaves to their own Tables were; Thus did she rellish every Bit, and take The genuine Pleasure of her sober Fare: Whilst those whom Plenty's Fat brimful doth keep, Their Palat's proper Joys can never reap. 282 This Art so pluck'd her Bodies plumes, that she Could easily grasp, and rule it with her Will: For she resolv'd it never more should be Permitted bigger than it self to swell; And if it winch'd and strugled, straiter yet By fresh severity she yoked it. 283 The tenderest Flesh's delicacy, she Us'd as an argument to pass them by: Those Fishes, whose rude shells are found to be Of daintiest Nutriment the Treasury, She for that Reason still despis'd; and none But choicest Viands always chose to shun. 284 The Garden's roseal and lily store, With all its wealth of Spice and Odours, she For being such, did scorn: of eastern Ore, Since it was rich, she would no Hoarder be: From Lute and Harp, because they pleasing were She pleasure took to sequester her ear. 285 (For yet Religion's cheerly jovial Days Incourag'd not the Christian Hemisphere: No Musick married Instrumental Lays To holy Churche's Anthems, striving here To echo those celestial Tunes which ring From Angels throats about their glorious King. 286 Else surely Psyche's Soul must needs have leap'd At such Delights; and her sweet-tuned Heart With its exultant Pulse due time have keep'd To all such pious Airs; by which the Art Of charming Sanctity can steal upon The coldest bosom, hot Devotion.) 287 Delicious Wine, because it guilty was But of it self, exactly she eschewed: The Gallantry of clothes, she held Disgrace In those whose hearts had Vanity subdued: By simplest Nature's Rules she strove to square What she did touch, or taste, or smell, or hear. 288 To Heav'n she charg'd on Fervor's wings to ride All those Affections which could traffick there, To be her Factors, and her Stock provide, Against her Death should thither send up her. And those, whose work lay here below, she taught To think it Heav'n, when upon Earth they wrought. 289 By constant waiting on her Penitence Her Tears acquir'd so quick an habit, that No Tide with such perpetual Effluence Its swelling Brine above the shores could shoot; Her Flood disdained Ebbs, and still she found Both night and day her cheeks and bosom drown'd. 290 Etesian Winds could never hold so long In breath as her loud sighs unwearied Blast; Nor could the Air's thin storms blow half so strong, Or one another forward croud so fast: And what for her Design so fit a gale Who meant through Sorrow's Ocean to sail? 291 Indeed when Days of reverend Churche's Joy Did in their festival horizon dawn, She laid aside her penitent Annoy, And with the Catholick Triumph mix'd her own: Yet still her Sighs and Tears she could not choose At least for joyous Love, to interpose. 292 Her Couch was ready furnish'd every where, Her valiant Sleep being on the naked Ground: Forecasting as she was, her lodging there Right politickly she contriv'd; and found A way to make her Grave seem neither odd Nor uncooth, when she there should go to bed. 293 And though faint Flesh, this Couch might churlish deem, She felt it courteous in the best of Love; Those lusty Thoughts which in a soft-lay'd Dream With hot uncleanness through the fancy rove; Were curbed by this sober Hardship's Rein Which cool'd all mutinies' pulses in her Brain. 294 For, wanton Cogitations Cowards are, The delicate tender Sons of easy Rest: Who painful Virtues hardy quarters fear, And only love a lazy downy Nest. Soft are their limbs, and therefore warm and drie Would fain be kept, and upon Feathers lie. 295 When sparing Capricorn would not allow To Day, a space as liberal, as to Night; She no advantage took, but studied how To piece up curtail'd Day with Candle-light: And still was up, though Phebus were in bed, Till her Devotion's Task she finish'd had. 296 But that to such extension swell'd, that she Was often spy'd, and overtaken by The laziest Morn, e'r her great work could be As great's her mind, and gain maturity. Yet then to Rest she seldom bowed till Her weary Head down on her Prayerbook fell. 297 For Time, inestimable Time, was that On which her only Avarice she fed: Griev'd that the world with such elaborate And costly Idleness had studied. A thousand courtly Pastimes, seeing they Alas, pass not the Time, but Man, away: 298 Madly-improvident Man; who though vain he Be sure he's sure of nothing, but to Die; Though in his power the next poor moment be No more than is the next Age; labours by The help of long-extended empty Sport To make the too-too-posting Hours seem short. 299 Psyche ne'r found so tedious a Day, But still she thought Night crouded on too fast: She knew, as hard and narrow, so the Way To Heav'n was long; and in her greatest haste She fear'd Death's darkness might rush on, e'r she Safe at her mighty Journey's end could be. 300 Unwearied Custom in this strictness made The sweetest world unsavory to her Taste: Her Senses relish'd not their wonted Trade, Tame were her Passions, and her Fervor's chaste; Her Body humbled and beat down so low, That no rank weeds in that dry Soil could grow. 301 Her Pulse beat none but Moderation's pace; Her virgin Blood cloistred it self within, And never look'd abroad but when her face In graceful Virtue's blushing Dress would shine: Her venerable gravely-moving Eye Darted no beams but those of Piety. 302 About her Soul her fleshy Vestment sate As close and fit as Fitness could devise; A Maid more trim and sprucely delicate She seemed now in Heav'n's judicious eyes, Than when she wore a larger bulk without her And her full Body ruffled more about her. 303 So just and strait her Feature was, no wild Distortions or Distempers room could spy Where to assail her: Health its kingdom held In every Part, and brisk Activity Liv'd in her mortified Flesh; whose skin Look'd near as pale, as she was pure within. 304 But yet her Mental Powers more lively were, Not being hampered or clogged by Those Fumes and Clouds which from luxuriant Cheer Full at the face of heedless Reason fly; And damp those Eyes with lazy Dimness which Objects sublime intended were to reach. 305 The Bow of all her sprightful Faculties She order'd to be always strung and bent: No bus'ness was so quick as to surprise Her heart asleep; nor could she be content Lazy Concoction's leisure to attend; If work were ready, ready was her Hand. 306 Thus quite disbanded in her troubled sky All gloomy Frowns she saw, which cleer'd into The cheerful beauty of serenity: She saw her rudely-blustering servants, who Disturb'd her Region, in one Calm united: And at this sight of Peace her soul delighted. CANTO XXI. The Sublimation. The ARGUMENT. Dead to unworthy Life, her self above Her self, aspiring Psyche lifts, and in Perfection's Sphere appoints those wheels to move On which her Logos and her Thelema ran. Then Satan she defies, though crafty He Came clothed in Angelick Clarity. 1 Hard is thy hap, poor Virtue, who by All Applauded art, yet truly Lov'd by Few; Whilst lucky Vice, although both Great and Small Brand her for Ugly, yet her horrid Hue They hug so close, that 'tis no Hell can fright, No Heav'n can woo them from that mad Delight. 2 With Most, Thou serv'st to trim Discourse, and paint Praise-hunting Gestures and ambitious Looks; But She, inshrined like the adored Saint, Reigns in the Temple of the Soul: in Books Thou dwellest, She in Lives; and though Thou art Frequently Read, She's oftner got by heart. 3 Or if thy worth so fortunate can be (For sometimes wondrous things will come to pass) As to convince our Approbation; we Afford thee still a warey shie Embrace: Some piece of thee we venture on: but are Jealous, in Goodness to proceed too far. 4 And witty too in Self delusion, we Against high-streined Piety can plead; Gravely pretending that Extremity, Is Vice's Clime; that by the Catholick Creed Of all the world it is acknowledg'd, that The temperate Mean is always Virtue's seat. 5 Hence comes the Race of mungrel Goodness; hence Faint Tepidness usurpeth Fervor's name: Hence will the earthborn Meteor needs commence In his gay glaring robes, sydereal Flame: Hence foolish Man, if moderately Evil, Dreams he's a Saint because he's not a Devil. 6 Rare souls are they, who still forgetting what Behind them conquer'd lies; with restless heat Reach at new Laurels, and adventure at Whate'r inviteth Gallantry to sweat; Who, like our Psyche, scorn their course to stop, Till they have doubled fair Perfection's Top. 7 For as the generous Spark is not content With having climb'd the Air's first stage, since by The spurring fervor of its natural Bent Above the third it aims; and needs must die, Unless it may its high Design atchieve, And in Fire's elemental bosom live: 8 So Psyche, who to Excellence's sphere Steer'd her brave Course, now for a second flight Her Wings and Resolution did prepare; Knowing a Third remained still, which might Her former Venture frustrate; if in this She coward turn'd, and bow'd to Weariness. 9 In meekly-daring Zeal, she vow'd to try The utmost of her strength: and fear'd not what Mishap might intercept her Bravery: Though Chance's Wheel in her hand rolled not, In God's it did; And upon This will I Since he has giv'n me leave, said she, rely. 10 As sure I am that he can bear me up, As that, left to my self, I down shall tumble: Nor can I fail to reach the glorious Top Of my inflam'd Ambition, whilst I humble My climbing heart: no longer will I, though On Earth I live, a Dweller be below. 11 Logos forthwith appearing at her Call, With fixed count'nance thus she him bespake: Thou seest with what exact Obedience all My vulgar Subjects on their shoulders take My heavyest yokes; and far, far be it Thou Who greater art, less Loyalty should'st show. 12 If common Herbs and Grass can learn to give Faithful Attendance on their Lord the Sun; What Candor can the Marigold reprieve From Censure's shameful Lash, if she alone Whom Nature joins so near to Him, denies Her higher Duties' kindly sacrifice? 13 Could thy best Hopes have ever thought that my Wild suburb Servants would have found such dear Content in those sad Loads; whose Novelty Quite slew at first their jealous hearts with fear? Yet now Tranquillity and Joy and Bliss The fruit of my severe Injunctions is. 14 To brutish Dulness being near of kin, Their ears disrelish'd Reason's sweetest Plea; And hard it was for heavy them to win Upon their carnal selves, and bow to Me. But should'st thou linger so, it monstrous were, And would with thine own Essence interfere. 15 Remember but thy noble strength, and dare To be thy self: no Arrow with such speed Snatcheth its shortest journey through the Air; No lightning with such nimble wings can spread Its self from East to West; as thou canst fly Ev'n to the crest of all Sublimity. 16 Abuse not then that brave Activity By hankering and flagging here below: Stout-winged Eagles ne'r were made to be Consorts to flitting Dunghil flies. O how Wilt Thou thine own worth answer, if thine aim Thou tak'st beneath thy Self, and thy high Name? 17 Alas, these sublunary Gewgaws be So full of Emptiness, that wretched they Will shrink and crumble into Vanity When thou begin'st to grasp them: never play At such poor game, as will but mock thy Pains; So far are they from answering cost with gains. 18 Learning, which looks so big, and nods Disdain On course illiterate Swains, could never yet More than that self-tormenting Wit attain Of understanding its own Want of Wit: Whilst simple Souls are never vexed by Those stinging Checks of learn'd Simplicity. 19 Yet no disdainful Knower e'r can gain That Admiration which ambitious He Hunts for with studious and palefac'd pain, Unless his Auditors unlearned be. Art wonders not at Art; 'tis Ignorance's Staring applause which Learning's fame advances. 20 How lost are those poor Worms, who though they crawl On Earth, will needs be traversing Heav'n's Hill: Where whilst their dazel'd Eyes and Brains do roll, The spheres with Birds and Beasts and Fish they fill; And though they talk much of Seav'n others there, Alas themselves the greatest Planets are. 21 Nature's Disciples, whose vast Library In every mine, and every Garden grow, Ne'r learnt for their own Health's security Such sure Receipts as each brute Creature knows: These know, They Guess, and make it plain appear That Beasts Physicians, Men but Doctors are. 22 The busy Schools, what are they but perplext And snarled Mazes, in whose wild Meander With thousand craggy scrupulous By-paths vext The everdoubting Student's forc'd to wander? Learning her self's a Circle, and the Soul Can find no Rest where she must always roul. 23 Had any Rest dwelt there, thou hadst not in Ecclesia's glorious Hall beheld how all The Patriarchs of Worldly Wit did grin Upon the Chains which held their Pride in thrall; And by sad Demonstration made them see How hard they studied endless fools to be. 24 What gains reap'st thou thy self when thou didst sow Thy pains on Nazerene or Cerinthian soil; When coyly scorning Heav'n's Instruction, thou Would'st with terrestrial Wisdom needs beguile Thy better Knowledge? in thy Blush I see Confession of that costly Vanity. 25 But ask thy Memory, and she will tell Thee what thou undertook'st when thou wert freed From fairtongu'd Heresy's foulhearted Hell: Of all thy Self mad'st thou not then a Deed To me? a Deed which still in force doth stand For sure I am, I cancell'd not the Bond. 26 And now Performance I require, nor will I bate a Tittle of the Obligation: If this strict Course involv'd thee any ill, I easly would admit thy Deprecation. But Bound thou art to thine own Happiness. And Heav'n forbid I thence should thee release. 27 No such Indulgence must I thee allow As most malicious Tyranny would be: Sooner among the clouds shall Dolphins row, And Eagles flutter through the deepest Sea; Then I will Accessary be to thy Enslaving freedom and self-felony. 28 No; thy perpetual Task henceforth shall be In Heav'n's soft air thy right-aim'd wings to stretch. Say not, they are too short; for Constancy Of Exercise will quickly make them reach, And thee enable gallantly to rise And soar amongst the Birds of Paradise. 29 Amongst those Birds who on the royal face Of th'everhighnoon Sun of Majesty In meek audacity devoutly gaze. Reading his mighty Providential Eye, And all those splendid Marvels his Dignation Permitteth to created Contemplation. 30 Thy endless study thou shalt settle there: But with this sober caution, that thine eye Trust not its blear and feeble self too far, But on that never-erring Glass rely Which in Ecclesia's Court to thee was given: Truth's Mirrour, and the Spectacles of Heav'n. 31 There may'st thou meet a Feast, and only there, Which all thy vast Capacity will fill: There may'st thou riot in that sacred cheer, Which would'st thou buy, the whole World could not sell; That cheer, whose worth's above the World as far As its Exuberance and Dwelling are. 32 Leaps not thy Soul at this? If any where Thy search can once retrieve a worthier Prize I'l not command thy strength to wrestle here: But since all Treasures this alone outvies; I must not suffer Scorn to say of thee, Logos could reason find a fool to be. 33 And that Anamnesis thine handmaid may Advance thy brave Adventure, upon Her My strict and peremptory charge I lay To see no Trash pollute her Register: For many a Toy which wears an harmless look, May cunningly deflower her virgin Book. 34 Wild fancy would be tame; did she not find A thousand Shapes of vain and useless Things Wandring about the storehouse of the mind; On whose soft backs she gets, and madly flings About the region of the Brain; when sleep In her blind arms doth Thee close pris'ner keep, 35 Those Arts unfortunately-pregnant Wits Bring forth to wait on Curiosity; That too-industrious Learning which forgets Th'eternal Wisdom; that sage foolery Which puffs up Pharisaick Hearts; that skill Which with fine froth the Theatre doth fill; 36 Quaint Legends, fond Romances, wanton Songs; With idelness's bus'ness, tickling News; Which swarm so thick upon unwary Tongues, And man's sole Treasure, precious Time, abuse; Must not that Bosom clog and pester, where Heav'n is desir'd to be a Sojourner. 37 No; Heav'n is large, and our poor Hearts are narrow; Heav'n will our utmost Stowage fraught, and more. The spacious breasts of Seraphs could we borrow, Still in Capacity we should be poor; Still would our Blisse's eb-defying Tide Over our highest banks in triumph ride. 38 Those Notions which their bounden tribute pay To Sanctity, I will not her forbid: But yet her Zeal's prime care shall be, to lay Up store of that pure Heav'n-descended Bread; Which Manna's famous bounty doth outgive, And teach frail Men eternal Lives to live. 39 That Bread which flourish'd from the Mouth of Bliss, God's sacred Word consign'd in Scripture; where Wisdom's best Jewels, and the rich excess Of deepest Learning, all inshrined are: That living Mine of Oracles, that spring Of every sober heart-contenting thing. 40 Such precious Eloquence ne'r built its hive On any Roman or Athenian Tongue, As in this honey-shaming Book doth live: Such rare ecstatick Sweets were never rung From humane Poets' love-oppressed Soul, As in each leaf and line their currents roul 41 For what is every leaf, and every line, But several Chanels through whose bosom glides The soft and supple Soul of most divine Most satisfying Truth; which welcome bids All holy Guests, and with unwearied Store Of royal Pleasures flow for evermore. 42 Her prudent Bottles must at every one Of these dear Streams be taught to drink: yet she Shall with most constant ardent study run To David's blessed Well; where Suavity In three times fifty Springs is bubling up, And liquid Heav'n to thirsty Souls set ope. 43 Then in the Song of Songs (that is, of Love, Who there in sacred Wantonness doth play, Streining his strong inamor'd Notes above The loftiest spheres most sublimated lay,) Her pious Revels she may freely make, And choise of Solomon's best Riches take. 44 But from the Evangelick fountains she The readyest floods of Holyness shall draw; Floods, in whose more than crystal Clarity Innumerable virgin Graces row; Floods were Humility, who only hath All Virtues for her handmaids, joys to bathe. 45 All Mysteries array'd in Sweetness there, And Life's own Life, she shall not fail to see: There God's own Motions in an human sphere Accommodated to her Weakness, she Shall safely read; and from the dropping Lip Of Jesus, how much more than Nectar sip. 46 And thus laid in; thy Stock so great will be As well may laugh at any fear of driving That generous Trade of busy Piety, And any Doubt of answerable Thriving. 'Tis rotten Wealth makes Bankrupts such, but thine Estate shall be immortal and divine. 47 Here Psyche ceas'd. But Logos scratch'd his head, And muster'd up his contradicting Wit: Yet her Proposal when he pondered, And what strong Reasons back'd and flanker'd it; Finding all Pleas forestall'd, he bow'd in mute Obedience to what he could not confute. 48 She, glad on any terms that Logos had Buckled his shoulders to this noble yoke; In all his Task a decent method made, That Time it self might call him to his book; And turn his leaves and shew him every day What lesson ready for his study lay. 49 For sad Experience oft had shewed her That best Imployments, if not ranked in A constant Equipage, would enterfere, And one another's Progress undermine: That Order is the soul of Bus'ness, and Supports the Work both of the Brain and Hand. 50 A glorious Week of Attributes she chose Among the Deitie's most boundless Treasures; And prest her Sev'n Days to attend them close Each at his proper cue: Time's constant measures She meant to count, not by the posting Sun, But her own Contemplation's Motion. 51 The Morn which to the World set Sunday ope, (That Sun's fair Day which did at Salem rise,) Awak'd her not, but found her ready up And busy at her work: the reverent eyes Of Logos wide were ope, and earnestly Fix'd on the Godhead's wondrous Unity. 52 Nothing is lac'd so strictly-strait into It self, as this immeasurable Nature; That Singularity which seemeth so Close girt to every Individual Creature; Hangs loose about them, if they judged be By this sole Rule of pure Simplicity. 53 A dull Passivity doth sneaking lie About the center of the Seraphs' hearts, Checking those Flames of their Activity Which seem all spirit: and wheresoever Parts Can be descry'd, though ne'r so close they run, Yet still the whole's not absolutely One. 54 O no! should God dissolve those secret Glues Which in their strait and spruce subsistance knit The purest Angels' Natures; that which shews So strangely single, would in sunder split; Their wings would moult and melt, their flames would die, And they themselves from their own selves would fly. 55 Ev'n Unity it self had never grown It self, if not shrunk up and model'd by This Prototype: that Unity, which thrown About this world, girts up all things which lie Under the foot of that eternal Throne On which he reigns, who is supremely One. 56 Yet not more truly One, than strangely Three, But knit up in a most mysterious Knot Of simple singular Triplicity: Which Psyche, though she comprehended not, Yet with admiring eyes she dwelt upon, As Eagles on the Light, the Flame, the Sun. 57 There she beheld, how infinitely Bold, And equally Besotted was their sin, Who in their wild Religion's List inroll'd A Croud of Gods: she now could easlier win Upon her Faith, to think that there were none At all, than yield there could be more than One. 58 O how she praised and ador'd that high And burning Jealousy, which though she saw Flaming with most indignant Ardency Upon the forehead of the ancient Law; Till now she knew not so profoundly why Heav'n most abhor'd Polytheous Piety. 59 But then embrav'd by meek heroick heat Nearer and nearer to this Knot she drew; And prostrate at her mighty Maker's feet This panting Cry upon his footstool threw: Great Lord, why may not I with Thee be One, Though not by Unity, yet by Union! 60 O, I am now a thousand Things a day! But were I once to Thee intirely join'd; No Objects should thy Psyche steal away, Nor into their vain selves transform my mind: Thy self, and mine I should behold in Thee, And all things else I could desire to see. 61 So I no longer should this moment be All Hope, and nothing else but Fear the next: So by no Checker of pure Clarity, And gloomy Doubting, should I still be vext: So to it self my Life no more shall give The Lye, nor I be Dying while I Live. 62 The next Day's Dawn her meditations drew On her adored Master's Truth to feed; Truth so supreme and infinitely true, As Seas of boundless satisfaction shed Upon her Intellect; whose daintiest Feast By Truth alone is furnished and drest. 63 Solid substantial Treasures here she saw, To which all other Beings, shadows are; And found compulsive Reason to avow This maxim which astounds a natural Ear; That God is in such sovereign Certainty Himself, that Nothing truely is, but He. 64 The Universe's Fulness being founded On Emptiness's self, it cannot be More real than its Bottom: what is grounded On frothy Bubbles, sticks to Vanity Close by the roots: and seeing All Things came From Nothing's womb, they must be like their Dame. 65 Hence, when a quickpac'd Intellect doth trace The lines of any Creature's Essence, though At first it meets with what presents a face Of solid Something; it will quickly grow To its vain journey's end; and stopped be By huge Abysses of Vacuity. 66 But when it launcheth forth into the Sea Of increated Nature, it can sail Through true and genuine substantiality Which never will its contemplation fail By terminating Want's ignoble shore, But lets it drive its Course for evermore. 67 And in this blessed Ocean Psyche met Such vast Reality, that in disdain She call'd the World, and all that swell'd in it, A mighty lye, dress'd up and trim'd with vain Embellishments; whose outside flatteries Make blear-ey'd credulous fools Delusion's prize. 68 Yet far more Sweets her Third Day did afford; For then her Speculation fix'd its Eye Upon the royal Goodness of her Lord, The fountain of unbounded Suavity; A fountain which it self at home doth fill, And through the Universe its Influence thrill. 69 For as the Sun on every Star doth poure The Bounty of his inexhausted beams; Inriching them with his illustrious store, Who else could ne'r have kindled their own flames: So all the Raies of Goodness which are read In Creatures' eyes, are but the Sparks of God. 70 Meer Sparks indeed, who of their Weakness by Their twinckling Tremor plain confession make: But God's supreme original Bonity Doth from its Home its vast demensions take: It lives, and flames in his most boundless Breast, And fills with sweetest fulness all its Nest. 71 Here Thelema leap'd in, and clearly found That God alone was absolutely Good: Fain, fain she would her ravish'd self have drown'd In this delicious Attribute's dear flood; But Psyche rein'd her Zeal; whose life she meant Should in another sacrifice be spent. 72 Her fourth Day's task was wondrous hard and high; For now her thoughts adventured to look Upon the Volumes of Immensity, The seal'd though ope, the plain though mystick Book Of her grand Lord's Extent: a Book which made The World to less than its first Nothing fade. 73 But as her Contemplations wander'd here, The further they went on, the further they Were from the end of their most endless sphere, Loosing themselves in their increasing Way: Yet Psyche felt her heart take dear delight Thus to be lost from morning unto night. 74 Oft did she cry, what though by loosing, I Am fain to find; by being Blind, to see? What though I cannot Comprehend, but by Granting my want of due Capacity? I am content, my God, since I by this Negation thy greatness best confess. 75 I see thou art Immense and Infinite, And therefore See thee not; yet see thee more By this unable and denying Sight, Than they whose saucy Eyes dare by the poor Comparison of whatsoe'r it be Express the Measure of thy Deity. 76 But since thou art so vast, O mighty Lord, Whence is't, that Man's scant narrow Heart to Thee An acceptable Dwelling can afford! How is it, that thy Love's Immensity Shrinks up thy Nature's! which is yet as great As 'twas before, ev'n in this Little seat. 77 And O, may Psyche's Breast become the Scene Of this dear Wonder! thy Infinitude Can no where find a Mansion so mean, So low, so disproportion'd to include What knows no bounds: O then inhabit me, And so shall I be sure to dwell in thee. 78 The fifth Day summon'd all her Might, to view That matchless Power of pure Divinity: Strait in her face the whole Creation flew With witness of its Author's Strength, which she Read from the fairest Heav'n's sublimest Crest Down to the gloomy Center's lowest Nest. 79 Yet though the universal fabrick were The full Expansion of Magnificence; She often chose the smallest Character Of close short-writ Epitomies; and thence Observ'd God's finger-work in smallest flies, As great as was his Arm's in widest Skies. 80 But Man took up her deepest Admiration: Man that rich Extract of all things beside, That wonderous Juncture of the whole Creation, By which the Heav'n to Earth is strangely ty'd; Yea more than so, for God unto the Creature Is married by none but Human Nature. 81 Such comely Architecture, such Concent Of fair Proportions, such Variety Of well-agreeing Rooms, such Ornament Of Softness, Politure and Colour, she Observed here, as fully taught her why Man was enthron'd in Nature's Sovereignty. 82 Yet not content thus at the second hand To feast her hungry Meditations; she Gallantly made a further Venture, and Gaz'd on her Maker's naked Potency; Where she discover'd strength enough to build More Worlds than Atoms she in this beheld. 83 Nor Bounds nor Bars she saw, which could forbid The Pleasure of his Hand, but only those Which Contradiction had established: Yet serv'd not they his Power to inclose, But to demonstrate that his noble Might Could nothing do but what was true and right. 84 O how she pitied those gay Princes, who Upon exterior helps misplace the Name Of Strength: and dread not what all foes can do, If they have once prevail'd with vaunting fame To publish to the World their numerous force Of Castles, Ships, Arms, Money, Men, and Horse. 85 For what are those swollen words to any King, Whose Arm's as short, whose sinews are as weak As those of his mean Peasants; who can bring No Legions into the field, nor wreak His challeng'd fury on his ready Fo, If his be not his Subjects' Pleasure too? 86 Can his sole Word the battle fight, and wrest The Laurel from the strugling Enemies? O no! his Power doth more in Others rest Than in Himself; and if by Mutiny's Unhappy spark, Rebellion's flame burst out, By his own forces his defeat is wrought. 87 But Psyche saw how her Creator's Might Fast to his proper Will alone was chain'd; Omnipotence, whene'r he pleased to fight Led up his Van, for in his Hand it reign'd; In that vast hand which doth support and stay All other Arms from mouldering away. 88 Yet though thus Potent, He is also Mild, And she as such the Sixth Day him admired: She sadly weighed, how all Ages held One Principle of Boldness, and conspired Against their Patient God, as if his strong Right-hand were bound because He held his Tongue. 89 Amaz'd she stood, to mark how He kept under Incensed Justice, who would fain have thrown His ready Vengeance dress'd in dreadful Thunder, In Wars, Plagues, Deluges, Drought, Famin, down Upon the wretched heads and hearts of those Who durst in spight of Mercy, be his foes. 90 Indeed she saw that Mercy fix her eye Upon the Rainbow; where she sweetly read An Obligation of her Lenity, Though Hell-encourag'd Sin bore up its head As high as Heav'n: yet by her own consent, Yea and desire, that signal Bow was bent. 91 The Bow was bent; yet not to shoot, but show How Mercy bound her self to do her best The world to shelter from a second Blow, Which from the first her only Hand releast. Else had the Deluge not repented, and To Earth made restitution of dry Land. 92 Else had the vaster flood of fire e'r now Broke from the banks of Fate, and over run Not only Nature's Colonies below, But all the fairly-spread Plantation Of highest Stars, and this condemned World Into its final funeral Ashes hurl'd. 93 This Speculation inform'd her how Much more heroick is the Victory, When Sweetness wreaths the Bay aboout the brow, Than when plain force snatches it thither: He In whom are both supreme, takes more delight In conquering by his Mercy, than his Might. 94 And O may I, said she, (when Night at length Warn'd this her Meditation to conclude,) Not by the dint of thy enraged Strength, Dear Lord, but by thy Mercy be subdu'd! If on a Worm thy Power thou wilt try, O let it be the Might of Lenity! 95 But then each Seav'nth Day brings her thoughts their Cue, The Wonders of his Glory to behold, Which from the six preceeding did accrew, And Brightness's Excess about him roll'd: Wonders which gave Heav'n's Quire their Task to sing Eternal Hallelujahs to their King. 96 And ravish'd here with mighty Joy and Love, She took with entheous Them her part of Praise; With utmost Zeal's intension she strove Her Acclamations to their Key to raise: And though she could not Sing so high nor clear Her hearty Musick pleas'd Heav'n's candid ear. 97 She Thought, and Sung, and then she thought again, For still new floods came rushing in upon her: God's other Attributes' illustrious Train Themselves in homage pay unto his Honor; In whose incomparable Vastness they Can all their now Infinitudes display. 98 Whatever breaths, or lives, or owns the least Share of Existence, constant Tribute brings To this bright Treasury, as well's the best And fairest Cherub: yea ev'n empty things, Defects and Sins, though not by Doing, yet By Suff'ring what they merit, render it. 99 And shall my duty faint and pining be, When all the World besides so fruitfull is? Forbid it mighty King of Souls, said she; Let not thy Psyche's heart the glory miss Of honoring Thee, yea though my Life it cost; That Life's best Saved which for Thee is lost. 100 In these high Roads thus did her restless soul Renew her fervent Journeys day by day: And as the Sun perpetually doth roul From East to West, yet still in Heav'n doth stay; So loftier-moving she in God alone Still found her happy self where-e'r she ran. 101 Thus having spent, or rather gain'd, some years, She chang'd her task, but not her Industry: For her meek Contemplation she prepares To wait upon her Spouse's Majesty; And those sweet Marvails of his Love to read Which over her, and all the World, was spread. 102 And here with sympathetick Exultation In amorous flames she strove her heart to melt; For in the tract of every speculation His Acts and Passions in her heart she felt, Which always sad, or cheerly was, as she His Sorrows or his Joys in thought did see. 103 A Pilgrimage much longer now she went, And travell'd all the way with more divine Delight, than when she from her Britain bent Her zealous Course to holy Palestine: Longer she dwelt on every Monument Of what her Lord for her had done, or spent. 104 For then her Soul ran gazing to her Eye, But now her Eye did to her Soul retreat: And in that mystick Holy Land descry Those Monuments all copied by the sweet Art of Devotion, but exposed to No dangerous Ambush of Cerinthian Fo. 105 A thousand times she sigh'd and wonder'd why Brisk generous Spirits, who hunt for noble Stories Through all Books else, should not be ravish'd by The Lustre of the Evangelick Glories; But more exactly strive to know the List Of Cesar's Acts, than what was done by Christ. 106 But more she marvell'd how a Christian Heart, Which scorn'd to give its blessed Name the Lye, Could possibly forbear to snatch its part In its Redemer's sacred History: How Love could quit its loyal self, and yet Not know whatever of its Spouse was writ. 107 Yet all this while on Logos's Wings she flew, (Though Thelema sometimes would flutter by,) And these were much too short and weak, she knew, To tower and double that sublimity; Which makes Perfection's third and highest story, The Crown of Saints, and all the Angels' Glory. 108 On Thelema, to practise therefore now Her Wit, she set, by charming Courtesy, Contriving how her mighty Heart to bow, And make it plyant to the Plot, which she Had lay'd to Catch her into Bliss: and then She gently grasp'd her hand, and thus began: 109 O Thou, the dearest of my Servants, who Command'st the Keys of all that I possess; Yea and of Me thy native Sovereign too, Who have no power to stir abroad, unless Thou op'st the door; how much I wish, that I Had more to trust with thy Fidelity. 110 But since I neither am, nor have no more, Let this suffice to bind thy heart to Me: In gratitude Thou canst no less restore Than prest Compliance, though I ask of thee Some hard and costly service, so to prove The rate and value of my Steward's Love. 111 But I my proper Interest can bate, And by my Subjects' Gains account mine own: Whate'r Advantages inhance their State, In my repute will higher build my Crown. They are my Riches, nor can I be poor So long as thriving They increase their store. 112 All my Desire's no more than this: That thou Would'st venture highest Happiness to reap; And now dull Sense and Passion valiant grow, Now Logos daily up to heav'n doth leap; Not flinch alone, nor be content to stay In any lower Region than They. 113 Remember that thy Wings of Strength are made; No flight's too high or long for metall'd Thee: No hard Design e'r made thy Courage fade, Unless thy Self did'st timorously agree To thy Defeat; such thine Advantage is, If Win thou Wilt, to Win thou canst not miss. 114 Jesus, the sovereign Lord of Thee and Me, Will give thee leave to make himself thy Prey: Reach then thine Arms of noble Love, that He Imprisoned in thy Embraces, may For ever make thee Free, and with the best Of Heav'n fill up and deify thy breast. 115 If this Adventure thou esteem'st too high, Throw down thy self before his blessed Feet: He cannot let thee there despised lie, But will thy Homage with Acceptance greet; And for that Resignation of thine, His gracious Self to Thee again Resign. 116 This gallant Challenge wrought so strong upon The generous heart of Thelema, that She The forward Proof of her Submission Shot instantly from her low-bended Knee; And Heav'n forbid, she cry'd, I should deny Your Pleasure, or mine own Felicity. 117 Though not at Jesus's royal feet, (O no, I am too vile to aim my Pride so high,) Yet, Madam, all my Self at your's I throw To be accepted, and disposed by Your Love and Wisdom; use me as you please, Lo I return you yours, and mine own Keys. 118 Triumphant Joy strait flam'd in Psyche's breast The Virgin's ready Loyalty to see: Whom she embraced thrice, and thrice she kist, And sweetly forc'd to bate her humble knee. Her welcome Keys she then to her own side (Weeping and smiling) in a loveknot ty'd. 119 And now I feel my self a Queen, said she, Queen of my Self: yet be assured Thou, O faithful Maid, shalt find thy self more free By this subjection, than when thou did'st bow To thine own blind and rash Desires; which have Made thee too oft to Vanity a Slave. 120 Exalted thus to her own Wishes' Crest, Into her pious Oratory She With Throngs of Vows impatiently prest, To celebrate a new Solemnity: An Holocaust she had to sacrifice, For which her own stout Zeal the Fire supplies. 121 Did golden Mountains tempt her now to stay; Did Millions of Worlds made up in one Inestimable Bait, smile in her way, And woo her but to let one Minute run Before her work; not all th'inchanting force Of those strong Complements could stop her Course. 122 No; she of joyous Love in travail is, And feels the pangs of dainty Parturition; Till forth she brings her mighty Sacrifice, 'Tis not all Heav'n can ease her smart condition. Speed, Speed alone could gratify her now: Speed's wings she snatch'd, and to her bus'ness flew. 123 So fast she flew, that she outstript the Thought Of all the World, which now she left behind her: No other Work but what she went about Lay in her Fancie's shop: Self could not mind her Of her own self; for, totally on fire, She nothing was but what she did desire. 124 A Preface of a thousand Sighs and Tears Before her brave Oblation she spread; As many mystick Groans to Jesus's ears Like Harbingers of her design she speed: Then prostrate on the ground her Face she laid, And of her humbler Heart the Altar made. 125 Upon this Altar, bound both hands and feet, Her Thelema she for the Offring threw: And, bend thy gracious Eye, she cry'd, thou sweet Compassionate Lamb of Heav'n, to Me, who sue For thy Acceptance of this Sacrifice, Which at the footstool of thy Mercy lies. 126 Thy royal Bounty gave this Will to Me; But I have long long found my self too weak To manage such a great Estate: to Thee I therefore render it. O gently take It home again, and govern it for Me The feeble Handmaid of thy Majesty. 127 Do with 't whate'r thou wilt; so it be Thine I care not what betide it; since I know Thy Pleasure, like thy Self, must be Divine. O see, see how it pants and heaves! if Thou Wilt not accept it, let it lie, for me; How can I love what is despis'd by Thee? 128 Never did Lightning flashing from the skie Rush down and flame to Earth with less delay, Than did the Fervor of this Prayer flie, And snatch from thence to Heav'n its sudden way; Nor made it there a stop at any Sphere, But scour'd through all and reached Jesus's ear. 129 Propitious He strait yielded his Consent, And opening wide his blessed Arms, embraced His Psyche's Offring with as high Content, As if Himself had more than She been graced. O King of sweetest Love, what Contemplation Can stand enough amaz'd at thy Dignation! 130 But zealous she now striving up to send Her Altar after her brave Sacrifice; Perceiv'd a suddain Plenitude extend Her bosom with such ravishing Rarities; That she perplext with unknown sweets, admired With what strange Paradise she was inspired. 131 At length examining her incroaching Bliss, Another Thelema in her heart she spyed; But in so lovely and majestick Dress. That whence she came she by her Looks descryed, And most profoundly felt she could by none Be sent, but by her heav'nly Spouse alone. 132 His Will it was, indeed: for noble He Not to Return, more than he Takes, disdains; In lieu of Psyche's Offring, instantly This Present, which more precious Worth contains Than Heav'n and Earth, from his own bosom's nest He delicately shot into her breast. 133 This grasp'd her soul so fast, and knit it so Intirely to her Spouse's heart, that She Strait seemed to have nothing more to do With Psyche's Interest, since potent He Was seized of her; and of self bereft, She now to Love's sole Tyranny was left. 134 Nor lost great Love his time, but domineer'd In her subdued heart with full carreer; And she as glad to be his Slave appear'd As he rejoyced to triumph on Her. For by his Conquests counted she her own, Being by every Fall far higher thrown. 135 Thrown up to new strange stages of Delight, And fresh Excess of those immortal Things Which never were debas'd to mortal sight, Nor stoop'd to please the Ears of proudest Kings: Things which the largest heart of Man with vain Indeavor pants and stretches to contain. 136 O no; spiritual mystick Joys, although They in the Bosom's inmost Closet dwell, Their Habitation's limits overflow, And past the shores of Comprehension swell. Lost in her Gains was Psyche, and by this Riddle of Solace made her Prize's Prize. 137 And now her Soul, much like a weaned Child Which wholly hangs upon his Nurse's Will, It self not by it self did move and wield, But absolutely resting on the Skill And Care of her dear Lord who tutor'd it, Was carried wheresoever He thought fit. 138 This made all Sweets and Dainties here below (For with such Names our fond Mistaks will grace them) Disrellish in her accurate Sense, and grow Truly themselves: which was enough to chase them From wise Acceptance; for their borrow'd shape Is that alone which do's our love entrap. 139 On God her only Joys she chose to feast; His Pleasure was her sole and precious Bliss; Her heart's sage Palate found such savory Taste In all His Statutes, that the Pleasantness Both of the Honey and the Honey-comb Lost in her approbation all their room. 140 What grated hardest on her Soul before, Wrongs, Slanders, Pains, Distress, Calamities, Mishaps, and Sickness tortur'd her no more; For by her Spouse's beck she mov'd her eyes, And still embrac'd as Best whatever He Did either Order, or Permit, to be. 141 This kindled such a Bonfire of Delight Throughout her breast, that had she been invited For goodly Paradise to yield her Right In this Possession, she would strait have slighted The mighty lure, and triumph'd still to be The Holocaust of Love's Extremity. 142 Yet was her Passion's wondrous Violence Sweetned with such divine Serenity; That with less undisturbed influence The Sun's full Beams about the Welkin flie To light the Day, than did these Flames of Love Through all her Heart's calm quiet rigions move. 143 In dainty Silence she her Soul possest With firm Adhesion to her secret Bliss; Ev'n all her motions mingled were with Rest, Because they still concentered with His; Whose Actions, though all Infinite they be, Their number up is ty'd in Unity. 144 Mean while the World, whom her Austerity Could not but check and sting; by peevish scorn Reveng'd themselves: for lo, said they, how she By Melancholy's blackness grown forlorn, Esteems her self as fair as if the best Of heav'n's bright Beauties had her count'nance drest. 145 In proud Retirement her Content she mews, And doggedly Reserv'd disdains to hold Fair Correspondence, or as much as use The Courtsy of her Friends: as if she could Not keep the Statutes of her God, but by Breaking the Laws of all Civility. 146 She from her self by wilful Robbery Plunders those honest sweets which gracious Heav'n To check Life's Tide of Infelicity Hath into Moderation's bosom given; And taxeth God's own Bounty, by Refusing What Men cannot approve but by their Using. 147 Should any paltry Begger venture so To serve her Ladyship, could she surmise That both the thankless Gift, and Giver too He scorned not? scarce would his humble Guise Persuade her that his Stomach's inward Pride Was by Devotion's Fervor Mortify'd. 148 Thus did the Ravens against the Swan inveigh: But now no seeds of Discontent remain'd In Psyche's heart: she let them say their Say, And from their Envy this new Laurel gain'd: Her silent Patience answer'd all their Scorn, And to her Crown their Calumnies did turn. 149 But as she reigned in this mystick Peace; Her's, and all pious Souls' eternal Fo, Counting his own Vexations by her Ease, Tore his fell heart with studying what to do. At length resolv'd, he hastes, the Uglyness Of his Design, in Beauty's Mask to dress. 150 Time was, when He Precentor of that Quire Which all the Spheres with Hallelujahs fill, Arrayed was in glorious Attire, Whose gallantry did then become him well: But when he Discord sung, and Rebel turn'd That Crime for him his hideous Blackness earn'd. 151 Yet he remembring his original guise, And skill'd in cunningest Hypocrisy, Patch'd up himself a Coat of gorgeous Lies, And many a comely Trapping got; whereby, Though He the Sovereign were of foulest Night, He might an Angel seem of fairest Light. 152 His ragged Horns of steel he plucked in, And on his rusty brazen Count'nance spread A soft, a ruddy, and welpolish'd skin; His Front, with envious wrinckles furrowed, He planed over, sweetning all his Face With blooming Youthfulness, and smiling Grace. 153 Into a knot he gathered up his Tail, And ty'd it at his back; of every Toe And Finger carefully he cut the Nail; And then his Hands and Feet he painted so That what before was harsh and sooty, now Usurped cleanly Daintiness's hue. 154 The glaring Pitch of his wide-flaming Eyes To moderate and comely Beams he turned; Beams which profess'd Cognation with the Skies, And like the highest Stars' pure glances burned. He borrowed both Arabia's Gales and Spice His Breath's rank Sulphure to aromatize. 155 His bushy snarled Locks of fretful Snakes He shaved off from his more angry Head; By whose advice into the Tomb he breaks Of an embalmed Virgin lately dead; And stealing thence her fresh-perfumed Tresses, His Baldness he with Curles of Amber dresses. 156 An hundred Swans then having plundered; Their fairest and their softest feathers he In two brave Combinations marshalled, And measured and poised equally; Which to his shoulders close he fitted, and A pair of goodly Wings had at command. 157 A Robe he chose whose colour scorn'd the Milk, And with his Wings did correspondence hold; Its texture was of light and pliant silk Belac'd and fring'd with oriental Gold: That both its Pureness and its splendor might Maintain, that down from Heav'n he took his flight. 158 Accouter'd thus; whilst Psyche wearied by Her holy Vigils, yielded unto sleep; Into her chamber softly stole the sly Impostor, and found out a way to creep Under the eyelids of her heart, where He Himself presented in his Pageantry. 159 But when she started and awoke: fear not Said cunning He, for Phylax is thy friend: These Raies of mine did never Terror shoot, But to thy Weakness Strength and Comfort lend: And Heav'n forbid that I should prove unkind Now thou my favor most deserv'st to find. 160 The gallantry of thy Devotion I Come to applaud, and to increase its fire: I grant thy zealous Wings have towred high, But yet thy Spouse would have them labour higher; And as immoderate in their Answer prove As is the Challenge of his boundless Love. 161 Has not thy Soul now chose her worthy station Far far above this groveling World below? Has not the Virtue of thy last Oblation Clasp'd thee close to thy God? how then canst thou Any ignoble Solecism bear, And make thy Motion lower than thy sphere? 162 The Watches frequent are and long, which thou In dear attendance upon Him dost keep; Yet oftner generous He, and longer too To purchase Rest for thee did loose his sleep. Be active now, remembring thou shalt have Sufficient sleeping time in thy still grave. 163 Low hast thou pluck'd thy Bodie's plumes; but He Was rent and torn and furrow'd up with lashes: Shall not the Zeal of thy Austerity Be legible in correspondent Gashes? I know thou lovest not thy skin; but yet 'Twere not amiss thus much were writ on it. 164 Severe and resolute thy fastings be If scanned by the faint World's vulgar fashion; But forty Days He deign'd to fast for thee, And now expects thy faithful Imitation: As well he may, who an eternal feast To quit a few days' fast, in Heav'n has drest. 165 Since then he means that thou with us shalt reign, Betimes it will become thee to prepare Thy self for our Society, and strein Out all the dregs thou hast contracted here; That raised to our Purity, thy Soul May in Angelick Orbs for ever roul. 166 By Moses and Elias, who beheld But at a distance Jesus's glimmering face, Shall Psyche be in Abstinence excell'd? Can she, on whom the Evangelick Grace With such full lustre beats, by those whom blind And shady Types envelop'd, be outshin'd? 167 O no; dear Pupil; since thy generous breast Dar'd wish to be inflamed by that fire Whose Aim's Perfection; let no lazy Rest Beclog the Wings of thy sublime Desire. What though thy death it hastens? Thou and I To life's fair Realm shall but the sooner fly. 168 Thus sought the wily Tempter to invite The Virgin to a fair-fac'd Precipice; But as the Lamb's inspir'd by natural fright To hate the Wolf, though in the honest fleece Of mildest sheep he trim his spight's adventure, And with the smoothest flattery complement her. 169 So Psyche's heart (for Heav'nly Charis there Close in the center of her Soul did lie,) Misgave her at the sight, and quak'd for fear Of this strange Angel's uncooth Courtesy: For all his dainty looks and skin, yet she Assured was, it could not Phylax be. 170 None of those soft and blessed Heats she felt, Which sweetly when her genuine Phylax spake Did all her breast into Compliance melt, And way for their own gentle Conquests make: Besides, the Voice, though scrued to appear Divine, seem'd something out of tune to Her. 171 Too high it seem'd, and of too loud a strein; Still was her Spouse's musick wont to be: Sweet Gospel notes, whose mildly-charming chain Drew by the strength of thrilling Suavity. Nor knew she why He suddenly should raise Into a Trumpet's Roar his gentle Layes. 172 Besides; had mighty He this Message sent, She knew her Heart (which now did pant and move By His sole motions,) must needs relent, And by submission his Commands approve. But now she by reluctant Nauseousness Felt, whosoe'r it were, 'twas none of His. 173 Awaking therefore her wise Confidence, And with three Invocations having sued Her Saviour to engage in her Defence, Upon her faithful forehead she renewed His potent sign; and then with courage cry'd, In Light's fair looks why dost thou Darkness hide? 174 Fair is thy face's Preachment to mine Eye, But yet thy Tongue's foul Language to mine Ear Sounds nothing less than Phylax: wherefore hie Thee hence, false feind, and seek thy booty where A beauteous Count'nance, and a snowy Pair Of wings, the full proof of an Angel are. 175 I know my Debt to my great Lord, is high; Yet I no more can pay him then I have: For his dear sake I more that once could Die, Yet must I not Destroy what He do's save. O no; Heav'n gives no such Advice, but Hell, Our selves in meer Devotion to kill. 176 As when the Sun's stout beams burst out upon A waxen Idol, straight its goodly face Too weak to bear that glorious Dint, doth run Away in droyling Drops, and fouls the place Which it adorn'd: so Satan melted at The servant Answer noble Psyche shot. 177 Off dropt his Coat, his Perriwig, his Wings, His roseal Vizard, and his milky skin: And in the room of those usurped Things His proper shape of Horridness began To clothe him round: at which indignant he,— Least Psyche should triumph his shame to see,— 178 Tore his way down to Hell, in cursed Night His baffled Head and his Disgrace to hide: A thousand Stinks behind him at his flight He left: and being tumbled home, he try'd Upon the Souls which in his brimstone Lake All yelling lay, his vexed spight to wreak. 179 But as the Victor, those quaint spoils admired Which dropped from her beauteous-hideous Fo, And with her Sacrifice of Thanks aspired Unto the footstool of her Saviour, who Had in that fight her faithful Champion been; Her old unfeigned Phylax flutter'd in. 180 O how her heart leap'd at the welcome sight, And thus broke from her lips! Thou, thou art He; I knew thee at the dawning of thy light In which no fauning lurks, nor fallacy: Spare all Probations: Thou need'st not tell Me who thou art; I know my Phylax well. 181 This said; her self before his feet she threw, Which hugging fast, she welcom'd with a kiss. He gave his Passion leave a while to shew The meek impatience of this sweet Excess: Then up he took her, and return'd upon Her Lip, what that unto his feet had done. 182 And, Joy, said he, my valiant Dear, of thy Victorious Encounter with thy Fo: That goodly furniture of Treason I As well as Thou who art the Victor, know: I saw the pilfering Traytor when he pickt It up, and when his ugly self he trickt. 183 Close at his heels I follow'd him when he His forgery advanc'd, and hither flew: I was Spectator when he stormed thee, And in Heav'n's Name his Hell against thee drew: Unseen I saw the dangerous battle, and By it I stood, but aided not thy Hand. 184 No; thy dear Spouse, who never can forget His humble faithful Servants, that supply Of Power provided, and conveyed it By ever-ready Charis's ministry. I claim no share; thy Thanks and Praises are Intirely due to none but Him and Her. 185 Thou find'st how bountifully they repay The loyalty of thy sublime Devotion; And what thou gain'st by giving Thelema To Him, who will not be in debt. Thy station Is now secure, unless thou back shalt start, And fondly home again recal thy Heart. 186 Surely thou never hadst so much thy Will As since thou hadst it not: for all things now Throughout the Universe thy mind fulfil, And Nature's Laws to thy great Pleasure bow; Because thy Pleasure's not thine own, but His Who of Omnipotence the Sovereign is. 187 That dainty Peace thou valuedst so high, Hath now its lodging taken in thy breast; Nor could the Tempter's deepest Subtilty Disturb thy Calm or undermine thy Rest. Be then content for ever to possess By holding fast thine hold, thine Happiness. 188 For if thou let it slip, and weary grow Of blessed Ease, it soon will fly away: No Certainty inhabits here below In this unstable flitting World; and they Alone dwell out of Change's reach, who are Infeof'd above in endless Quiet's sphere. 189 Take heed no desperate Logick make thee be Most dangerously secure: O never dream That thou by God's Immutability Unalterable prov'st; for still the same Will He remain, though from this Bliss's brink Thou start'st, and fall'st into Perdition's sink. 190 'Tis true, those everlasting chains which tie Heav'n's Destinations to their Ends, excel All Adamantine firmitude, and by No opposition of Earth or Hell Are forced to betray their hold: yet this No ground of Confidence to Mortals is. 191 For those Decrees profoundly treasur'd are In His dread bosom which no Angel's eye Dares peep into. This maketh pious fear, Religious Awe and holy Jealousy; The only Anchors which Assurance can Afford unto the tossed heart of Man. 192 And this to him Heav'n's favour is; least he Should bold and careless grow, if once he saw The Patent of his own felicity Were sign'd and seal'd so sure, that by the Law Of absolute Necessity, he through All Tempests safely to his Port must row. 193 For then should he be but a thankless slave To Bliss; whose Crown for none prepared is But them who venture at it by the brave Ambition of Humble Holiness: Then if he lists, his mighty God might he Disdain, and dare him with his own Decree. 194 O then with reverend Dread march on my Dear, In this Design of thy high Virtue; and Think it sufficient Happiness, if here Thy Fear can Desperation countermand; If thou by Trembling canst Victorious grow, And meet thy Laurel with a sweating Brow. 195 As for these Spoils, the Trophies they shall be Of what by Love's assistance thou hast done: These Memorandums of thy Victory May keep awake thy wise Devotion: Lo here I hang them up; and if again The Serpent hither creep, shew him his skin. CANTO XXII. The Persecution. The ARGUMENT. Still Satan wars on Psyche's Constancy; Both by his own and Persecution's Hand; But most impregnably resolved She Their Mines and Onslates doubts not to withstand; Until her Guardian by a blessed Cheat Enforc'd her to a glorious Retreat. 1 Their Nest though Joys, and Loves, and Blisses make, In Peace's bosom; oftentimes beneath That Surface of Security a Snake His unsuspected Venome sheltereth: For 'tis an everlasting Statute, that No genuine Rest can here below be got. 2 Else Glory's Favorite, admired He Who reign'd on Peace's, Plenty's, Wisdom's, throne, Had compassed Content's serenity, And in his Joys found Ease: but Solomon Could neither with his Brain nor Treasure free His great Self from Vexation's Vanity. 3 The Creatures courteous Faithlessness, who still Shrink from our grasping hands and cheat our Hope; Admonish our Desires themselves to fill At those pure springs of fulness, which stand ope In Heav'n alone, and never fancy here Complete Delights and Satisfaction's Sphere. 4 This makes courageous hardy Exercize Dearer to Virtue than is lazy Quiet; Hence she so highly Patience learns to prize, And constantly her self with Suffrings diet; That this sharp sauce may wholesomly repress Of Peace's Sweets and Fat, the Fulsomness. 5 Affliction is the only School where she Is Magnanimity's brave Lessons taught: The Theatre on which her Gallantry Before the royal Eyes of Heav'n is brought; Where of her Acting both the Angels, and The Angels' Sovereign Spectators stand. 6 Full well she knows that stealing Rust will creep Upon the briskest Sword, if lazily In his blind quiet sheath he lies asleep, And be not rubb'd, nor chaf'd, nor vexed by Harsh scouring, churlish whetting, or kept bright By its perpetual bus'ness in the Fight. 7 That never Horse was made of so much fire, Nor temper'd for so proud impatient speed, Though Pegasus had been his sprightful Sire, Or Titan's fiercest heav'n-devouring Steed, But if he stirr'd not from his fat and lusty Manger and Rack, would soon prove lame and resty. 8 That purest Air, if in Tranquillity It loiters in the Sun, will putrid grow: But when 'tis startled and afflicted by Thunder and Lightning: when it feels the blow Of boistrous winds; its drowsy dull Disease Wakes at the frightful News, and vanishes. 9 That sluggish Lakes which alway sleeping lie Upon their easy beds of Mud, beget Of Toads and Stinks a nasty Progeny: But those brisk busy Rills, which, though beset With craggy Hindrances, still struggle through, Preserve their Worth, and clean and limpid flow. 10 That never Soil was so ingenuous yet, But, if not duly worried, digg'd and plow'd, Harrow'd and torn, and forced to be fit By such sharp usage; with a rampant Croud Of useless Thorns and Thistles would defeat All hopes of honest advantageous Wheat. 11 That never Tree was known so thrifty, as To spare his juice and husband it aright; But on loose idle Suckers would misplace The careless Bounty of his verdant Might; Until the disciplining Pruner's Hook Lopp'd of those Wantons, and reform'd the Stock. 12 That if the goodliest Watch be not wound up; In vain the curious Wheels are glib and fit, Even and stout the String; in vain that shop Of artificial life is clean and neat; The Virtue of the Spring, alas, is drie, The Hand turns only lame, the Quick doth die. 13 That finest Vestments, when they idle lie, Would gather nasty Dust, and quickly breed Of Moths,—a most ingrateful fretting frie— Unless the earnest Wands and Brushes did Rouse up their laziness, and whip away Those busy bold Incroachers from their Prey. 14 That Mariners who in the easy Bay Their Winter and their Summer fondly waste; Would never learn to steer their Bark, till they Were by some Tempest into Danger cast; And had accustomed their venturous Minds To ken the boisterous language of the Winds. 15 That Soldiers listed are in vain, and wear Steel by their side, and Brass upon their head; If they decline the pitched field, and fear To face the shouting Fo, and battle bid, To force Success, and bring away their skars As Letters testimonial of their Wars. 16 And though no Life scarce any Title merits But that of War; (so many Enemies By his most wretched Birthright Man inherits, Since rebel Adam taught the World to rise Rebelliously against himself;) no state More than the Christian, is besieg'd with Hate. 17 The Christian Life the surest Warfare is; And though a thousand Victories it gains, Yet on it still more and more Armies press, More Care, more Sweat, more strugling still remains: Though in an inward Calm Peace luls us, yet External Tryals still will us beset. 18 Though all the headstrong Senses and the Passions Be civilized Virtue's yoak to bear: Though all the stickling peevish Insultations Of crossgrain'd Will and Reason, by the care Of an untired Soul be tam'd, yet still There is a World without to work her ill. 19 For by her Christian Course, against the Tide Of all that world she rows; and therefore by Eternal Opposition is try'd, And hardned to victorious Constancy. No way had She Magnanimous to seem If she had floated down the willing stream. 20 But now her gallant Metal wetted is; Her own luxuriant Twigs are prun'd away; Her Clothes are brush'd from Moths and Dustiness; Her soil is digg'd and dress'd; the lazy Bay She changeth for the active manly Main; And in pitch'd field her foes doth entertain. 21 Her Beasts are to their pace right strictly kept, And daily ridden hard; her wholsome Air By frequent Tempests of loud sighs is swept, Tempests, which make her Bosom's region fair; The Torrents of her Eyes continue clear Because perpetually they flowing are. 22 Her Watch by constant Vigils up she winds, And every Wheel in its due motion keeps: By which unwearied Diligence she finds How every Hour doth pass: yea though she sleeps, Still her Devotion's waking spring persists, And towards Heav'n she moves ev'n whilst she rests. 23 Thus though Affliction's looks be sad and sour, Her Heart is kind, and she the best of friends; Whilst Ease her Poisons gently plots to pour, Her Antidotes She most severely blends; Her Physick, smart and searching Corsives be, But their Conclusion's always Lenity. 24 And Psyche, since she's to her Spouse as dear As is the blessed Apple of his Eye, Abandon'd to Affliction's full carreer Must now be left; that as Sol's Majesty From blackest Clouds breaks out with fairest Rays, So might her Virtue pluck from Briars Bays. 25 When Satan for his late Repulse could find No comfort in his spightful Tyranny Over his damned Slaves; his frightful Mind Boil'd with such hot Impatience, that He Into the Air's cool region again Flung up himself with terrible Disdain. 26 Where, as he champ'd his meditating Rage, He chanc'd a winged Squadron to espy, Returning home in beauteous equipage, Having dispatched each his Embassy, With which they had been delegated hither From Heav'n, to fit our Earth to mount up thither. 27 This prompted him to brew a new Device: With cunning speed he play'd the Thief again, And having stoll'n a Tire of Gallantries, After the Angel-troops posted amain; Trimming his cursed feature as he flew, Till like a Bird of that fair Brood he grew. 28 Something behind he lagg'd, least piercing They His impudent Imposture should descry, And intercept his Project by the way In just Disdain of his foul Company. So at wise distance sneaks the Traitor, when True-hearted Peers to Court he follows in. 29 But fluttering through the spheres, his lips he bit To see the famous fatal Tract whereby He once was tumbled headlong down; and yet Though they with fell Despite and Blasphemy Were big, he durst not ope them, knowing well Heav'n ill would bear the Dialect of Hell. 30 Arrived at the everlasting Gate, Into th'imperial Palace of their King, The well-known Angels in triumphant state Their entrance made: but Satan's foreign Wing Shiver'd for fear; so did the Vizard he Had clapp'd upon his Guilt's Deformity. 31 For from the Luster of his Maker's eyes Such Dread flashed on his, that swarthy He, Who had been us'd to Night's black Prodigies, Was dazel'd at the naked Majesty Of more than day: Three times he winck'd, and then With both his hands his spurious eyes did screen. 32 Such fright the sooty Bats is wont to seize When Highnoon's darts of splendor shoot them through: The woful Ghosts who in sad shadows please Their gloomy Thoughts, thus terrified grow, If in the East the curtains ope are thrown, And up Aurora get e'r they be down. 33 The blessed Spectacles which here he saw Were sharper Torments than he felt at home; No Glories' sparkling streams could near him flow, But burnt him more than his own fiery Doom: Each holy Joy a Torture was, and He Fry'd in the midst of this felicity. 34 He fry'd and flam'd, and strait his look's spruce Craft, His forged Plumes, his curled Grove of Hair, His dainty Coat, and all his gorgeous Theft A sacrifice unto the lightning were Of Jesus's Eyes; and in his naked Dress He now appear'd of helish Ugliness. 35 The Angels started at the hideous sight, And standing at a distance round about, Gaz'd on the Portent; who with all the might Of Impudence, although a while he fought, Could not against his guilty shame prevail; Down hung his Head, his Tallons, and his Tail. 36 Thus when the conscious Traitor's hateful face Is in the presence of the Prince descry'd, And persecuted by the joint Disgrace Of all the loyal Court; against that Tide Of Ignominy he in vain contends; Such Horror all his Stubborness transcends. 37 As Jesus saw the fiend, abashed so, He charg'd him to confess from whence he came: Nor durst the thus commanded Monster, though Lyes were his only Trade, a fiction frame: Yet loth to loose the credit of his Pride, With dogged sullenness he thus reply'd. 38 Whence can I come, but from Beneath? unless You know some higher place than this your Heav'n? This Heav'n, from whence by you, I must confess, (But let All judge how justly) I was driven. From visiting the Earth I come, where I Have far more Subjects than your Deity. 39 But mine, said Jesus, (for he scorn'd to chide The stomachful fiend, since ever-damned He Finds equal Torment for his endless Pride,) Although so few, yet highly Precious be. Vain multitudes to Thee their homage pay: Mine not by Number, but by Weight I weigh. 40 By Virtue's Weight; for that alone can show The worth of Gems: and such my Servants be. Who though a while Inhabitants below, Yet are an Heav'n-descended Progeny; Whose genuine Raies assert their noble birth, And in their Dust prove something more than Earth. 41 Let one Example speak the praise of All; My handmaid Psyche; Hath thy prying Eye Which scoureth round about the terrene Ball, Full notice taken of her Piety? And how none live in all that World, who be Higher above it, than is lowly she? 42 Is not her Soul intirely fixed here, Preoccupating Heav'n and endless Bliss? Nor Earth nor Hell can strike her thoughts with fear, But He alone who her Creator is; Of Him she always stands in dainty awe, For still she loves as much as dreads his Law. 43 But wheresoe'r she reads the open face, Or can discover but the Limbs or Claws Of ugly Sin, she flies the dangerous Place, And into straitest hardest shifts withdraws; Rather than hazard to be overrun With pleasure-promising Destruction. 44 Is not the temper of her warey Heart, Admonished by wise instinct, afraid Of every Bait, which by the subtlest Art Of spight and Wickedness for her is laid? Or is there any Hag which she doth more Than Thee, ev'n in thy fairest Looks abhor? 45 Stung by these words, with strong intestine Pain, The Monster felt his heartstrings stretch'd and torn; Yet that he might not bear these Pangs in vain, But on his God his Stomach's Vomit turn; He rear'd his face of everlasting Brass, And what he spake, of that bold metal was. 46 Is not your mighty providential Arm Become that paltry Wench's hedge, said he, Infallibly to shut out fear and harm, And make her Pris'ner to Security? Is not brave Phylax forc'd to be her Squire, And dance attendance on that Brat's desire? 47 On all her Errands runs not servile He? Has he not trotted from the farthest West, In duty to her Curiosity, Into the fondly-venerable East? Where like a silly Pilgrim up and down, Forsooth, the Angel jogg'd from Town to Town. 48 Nay and your Daughter Charis too (yet who Would think her so, who her Imployment sees?) As though in Heav'n she nothing had to do, Degraded is to Earth, and charg'd to please This Imp of Dust, on whom her noble store Of Sweets, to win the Urcheon, she must pour. 49 A worthy Purchase you have got; but I For my part, would not buy a Worm so dear. If wretched Psyche's price must be so high, Surely you need no rival Chapmen fear: Only by this proportion I would know What rate you would for Me, for Me, allow. 50 Me, whose sublime, and therefore envied Nature Hath no cognation to ignoble Dust: Me, whose sole blemish is the Name of Creature, Which yet is not my Fault: Me, whom you must Confess to be the Crest of your Creation, However plunder'd of my native Station. 51 But as for Her, might I have leave to try, I soon would shew you of what brittle Clay She moulded is: would Phylax not deny To let me on her naked shoulder lay This Hand of mine, no Touchstone you should see Was ever nimbler at Discovery. 52 For on your pamper'd Darling should Distresses With full and free Commission domineer; That Tongue which now your Praises' Pageant dresses (For to the Task 'tis hir'd, and hir'd full dear) Would change its Tune, and on your Godship spit More Curses than my Self e'r spew'd on it. 53 If Psyche's bosom harbours any Breed Of such profound Ingratitude, replied Almighty Jesus, 'tis no more than need The ugly Embryos be in time descried. Go, use thy Skill; full Power to thee I give: No Phylax shall against thy Project strive. 54 Yet must thy Tether not extend so far As to her Life: her Life belongs to me: For in my Hand th'authentick Volumes are Of mortal and immortal Destiny. Nor could'st thou make th'Experiment, unless She lives, to belch out her Unthankfulness. 55 As when the Lyon's loos'd to tear his Prey, With furious Joy he shakes his dreadful Crest He mounts his surly Tail, and rends his way Into the Theatre: so Satan prest Back through the Spheres, and thought his Shame was cheap He suffer'd there, since he his End did reap. 56 For his mad Spight's irrefragable Pride Would not permit him mannerly to part: He neither bow'd, nor bent, nor signify'd The least of Thanks for gaining what his heart Did most desire; but thought he needed not Take other leave, who leave to rage had got. 57 As down through Heav'n he rush'd, he proudly threw Scorn on the Stars which he could not possess: Then through the Air imperiously he flew, And by his looks proclaim'd that Realm was his; The blackest Clouds which floated there, made haste To clear the way, till blacker He was past. 58 His swarthy Wings lash'd that soft Element With violent speed, and made it roar aloud: No wind did ever with such furious Bent Or hideous Noise, through those mild Regions croud; No Bolt of Thunder ever rent its path With such precipitant tumultuous wrath. 59 Though once he hop'd he might have reach'd his Aim By those fell Agents he dispatch'd from Hell: Yet since without their Errand home they came, To this curs'd bus'ness he in person fell; Resolv'd whatever Labour or Disgrace It cost him, Psyche should not 'scape his chase. 60 Thus came the Monster to his dearest Place On Earth, a Palace wondrous large and high, Which on seav'n Mountains' heads enthroned was, All which it higher rais'd with Majesty; Thus by its seav'nfold Tumor copying The number of the Horns which crown'd its King. 61 Of dead Men's Bones were all th'exterior Walls Rais'd to a fair but formidable height; In answer to which strange Materials A Graff of dreadful depth and bredth did wait Upon the Works, fill'd with a piteous flood Of innocently-pure and holy Blood. 62 Those awful Birds whose Joy is ravenous War, Strong-tallon'd Eagles, perch'd upon the head Of every Turret, took their prospect far And wide about the World; and questioned Each Wind that travel'd by, to know if they Could tell them News of any bloody Prey. 63 The inner Bulwarks rais'd of shining Brass, With Firmitude and Pride were buttressed. The Gate of polish'd Steel, wide open was To entertain those Throngs, who offered Their slavish Necks, to take the yoke, with which That City's Tyrant did the World bewitch. 64 For She had wisely order'd it to be Gilded with Liberty's inchanting Name: Whence cheated Nations, who before were Free Into her flattering Chains for Freedom came. Thus her strange Conquests overtook the Sun, Who Rose and Set in her Dominion. 65 But thick within the Line, erected were Innumerable Prisons, plated round With massy Iron and with zealous Fear: And in those Forts of Barbarism, profound And mirey Dungeons, where contagious stink, Cold, Anguish, Horror, had their dismal sink. 66 In these, press'd down with Chains of fretting Brass Ten thousand innocent Lambs did bleating lie Whose Groans, reported by the hollow Place, Summon'd Compassion from the Passers by; Whom they, alas, no less relentless found Than was the Brass which them to Sorrow bound. 67 For they designed for the Shambles were To feast the Tyrant's greedy Cruelty; Who could be gratified with no Fare But such Delights of salvage Luxury: Though sweetest Dainties woo'd her morning Taste She with an hundred Lives would break her Fast. 68 Vast were the Treasures of her house; yet she Solac'd her Fancy in no Furniture But choicest Tools of Inhumanity, Which might her bloody Ends to her assure. This stuff'd her Court with direful Engins; this Made every Room an Armory profess. 69 Swords, Daggers, Bodkins, bearded Arrows, Spears, Nails, Pinsers, Crosses, Gibbets, Hurdles, Ropes, Tallons of Griffens, Paws and Teeth of Bears, Tigres' and Lyons' Mouths, hot iron Hoops, Racks, Wheels, Strappados, brazen Cauldrons, which Boiled with oil, huge Tuns, which flam'd with pitch. 70 These, and more dangerous Weapons yet were there; Fairfaced Promises, but lin'd with Spight; High royal outside Courtesies, but mere Traps and Conspiracies, which with Delight To heedless Men the worst of Poisons give, And stealing to their hearts slay them alive. 71 Satan arrived here, strait enter'd in; (For well he knew the Place, and well was known;) The fawning Courtiers all were proud to win His gracious Look, and in his way fell down To beg his Blessing and to kiss his feet, As on he press'd their Sovereign to greet. 72 She then (for long within she could not stay) Preparing was her Chariot to take, And her loud Stomach's sharp Commands obey: But spying Belzebub, she started back, Surpris'd with reverential Dread to see The sudden Presence of her Deity. 73 Then down she fell, and pray'd Him to ascend Her Throne Imperial, which was standing there; And thence his Pleasure to his Worm commend, Ready with all Humility to hear What bow'd her God so low, as thus to come In person to his worthless Vassal's Home. 74 But kindly taking up his loyal Creature, He in his scaley Arms did her embrace; Inamor'd of her correspondent Feature, Which render'd him his own infernal Face. Three times he kiss'd and hugg'd her close, and round About her waste his royal Tail he wound. 75 And, I have no such leisure now, said He, To climb thy Throne, who must secure mine own; I have discover'd in my Brittany The Seeds of dangerous Rebellion sown; Which to an harvest, if it thriveth, may Disturb mine Empire, and thine oversway. 76 The Christian spreading Canker there hath got Deep footing in the hearts of heedless Men; Who to the poor mechanick God are not Asham'd to pay their holiest Homage, when With Credit they might it to Me prefer Who am, I trow, more than a Carpenter. 77 Me thinks my Scepter should as noble be As Ax or Mallet; and as brave my Train Of heav'n-descended Sparks, the gallantry Of whose high Souls, did God's own Yoke disdain; As those who from their dirty Fishing Boat Into the threadbare Court of Jesus got. 78 It cannot be deny'd but mighty I Had a Mischance of old; and I confess My foot once slip'd; yet still my Majesty Above Reproach's wretched triumph is. My Honor suffer'd not in that my Loss, And though I fell, I fell not to a Cross. 79 They use to cast it in our teeth, that We By blackest Powers of Spells and Incantations Both founded and advanc'd our Monarchy: As if there were not stranger Conjurations In this besetting Witchery, which can Make worse than Beasts of Reasonable Man. 80 For, Brutes to brutish can the silliest Flock Afford, who would themselves with Him intrust Who runs away to Heav'n; and bids them look For Wrongs and Crosses, which indure they must For his dear Sake? right dear indeed, if they Their Lives must to his cruel Precept pay. 81 Strange sheep were they which thus would fooled be, And for their Loyalty to Him alone Be quite abandon'd, and relinquish'd free To thousand Wolves' and Bears' Incursion: Nay Sheep would never turn so sheepish; yet Men to this Paradox themselves submit. 82 Grant Heav'n be in reversion their own; What shall the Fondlings gain by dwelling there, Who must eternally be crouching down, And paying Praise's Tribute to His ear, Who will requite them with a Chain, which shall Bind ev'n their Wills in everlasting Thrall! 83 Were not their Souls more generous, if they The gallant Freedom of our Hell would choose; Which scorneth that ignoble Word Obey, And lets full Blasphemy for ever loose? Faint-hearted Fools, who needs will Vassals be For fear least I should make them truly Free. 84 Thou see'st this Crime is Crying, and for high Revenge beats loud upon my royal Ear. And should my Fury wake, and instantly Those mad Apostates all in pieces tear; Surely my Justice I could well acquit, However envious Heav'n would rail at it. 85 But I (for this far more becomes a King) A better rellish find in Lenity: I know the Galilean's tongues do ring With restless Clamors on my Tyranny: Forgetting that their Lord has banish'd me From Heav'n, against all Law and Equity. 86 Yet neither He nor They shall ever make Brave Me their Baseness in its kind repay. No: let them henceforth Demonstration take With what intolerable Slander They Lay to my charge all barbarous Cruelties: Judge all the World, who Father is of lyes. 87 For I resolved am at first to try What by my royal Mercy may be done: Far rather would I win them thus, than by Stern Vengeance drown them in Destruction. The People's fault is not so foul, as His Whose gospel Pipe has charm'd their Simpleness. 88 Snatch, therefore now thy necessary speed To Britain, and divulge my Proclamation Of Grace and Pardon unto every Head, Which strait abjures that dangerous Innovation, And penitent for his Christian Heresy, With orthodox Devotion bows to Me. 89 To Me, who will their Loyalty requite With golden Plenty and with pleasant Ease; To Me, whose Laws are Statutes of Delight, Not of unnatural Severities, Of Watchings, Fastings, Sighs and Tears; O no! What Mildness means I better know than so. 90 But if my princely Favor be despised, Both Heav'n and Earth must needs my Rage approve. Denounce all Vengeance that can be devised By scorn'd and therefore most indignant Love: Make all the stupid stubborn Rebels feel That I can on their Earth display my Hell. 91 This said: the Feind with three short adorations Of her dread Lord, her salvage Task embrac'd, And loth that ceremonious Dilations Should greater Duties stop, to Coach made haste. Thus mounting at the Gate, they parted; He Home to his Hell, and towards Britain She. 92 Forthwith, in terrible Magnificence, An hundred Trumpets sent their Voice before, To tell the People that their awful Prince Her Progress now began: that stately Roar Through every Street imperiously flew, And warn'd all Eyes this mighty Sight to view. 93 When lo, the sweating Throngs her way bespread With Admirations of her Pomp and Train, Two Squires before the rest at distance rid, Suspition and Envy: both did rein Their fitting Steeds, the one a Fox, the other A Wolf, and forc'd them on to march together. 94 The next was Blandishment, whose winning Face Alone was open to the People's eye; On whom she smil'd with amiable grace, And cunningly maintain'd her goodly Lye: For all her Harpy-bodie's monstrous Fashion Lurk'd in her Trappings spruce Dissimulation. 95 Then follow'd Pride upon a surly Horse, Whose stomach swell'd like Her's: fierce Sparkles broke From his impatient Eyes; with martial force He bent his Neck's large Bow; his Main he shook; About he flung his Foam; and champ'd his Bit, For both his Rider he disdain'd, and it. 96 But in her right hand She a Banner held, And fair display'd its bosom to the Wind: Forthwith the Flag with stately Fulness swell'd Wherein the Tyrant's golden Scutcheon shin'd, A widespread Eagle, whose stout Pinions seem'd To bear her up still as the Colours stream'd. 97 Then came the Coach, which two strange Monsters drew, For one a dreadful Lybian Dragon was, Who from his mouth did flaming Sulphure spew, Empoisning all the Way he was to pass: The other, an enormous Crocodile, The most accursed Son of happy Nile. 98 On them, two fierce Postillions mounted were: Intolerable headstrong Anger, who Her Dragon's sides with restless Lashes tore, Yet knew not why she him tormented so: And Cruelty, whose heart was harder than His knotty Crocodile's black iron skin. 99 Upon the Coachbox sate a Driver, hight Selfwil, a madbrain'd most outrageous He; Who makes devouring Speed his sole Delight, Though thousand Perils chide his Fervency Never could Hills or Dales, or Sea or Land, Or desperate Precipices, make him stand. 100 The Chariot's metal nothing was but Brass, Bright burning Brass; of which each dismal side With sharp and hungry Hooks thick platted was, To mow down All it met: in this did ride The dreadful Queen, a Queen of mighty Fame Who hath not heard of Persecution's Name 101 All Frowns which make stern Panthers' aspects be Of ravenous Cruelty the hideous Book; With indefatigable Industry She had transcrib'd into her monstrous Look, And strangely turn'd her vainly-humane Face To Inhumanitie's most frightful Glass. 102 The mighty Plea of gracious Innocence Proves weak and useless at her salvage Bar; For causeless Spight, and bloody Violence Her only Laws and only Pleasures are. Heav'n shield all pious Souls, and raise their fears To generous Faith, where-ever She appears. 103 Her steely Coat's all smear'd with gore; her Hands Gripe two imprison'd Twists of angry Snakes, With which, though still her Coachman never stands, Eternally she threshes him, and makes His furious Speed more speedy grow, that she Might at her Prey as soon's her Wishes be. 104 Thus whirl'd she through the Popular Rout, and flew To her desired Isle the straitest way; Behind the Coach her larger Train she drew, Right glad to tread her cruel steps; for they Were All her own infernal genuine Brood, Whom she had nurs'd and fatten'd up with blood. 105 Upon a Goat, more stinking far than He, Rode Ravishment; who threw his licorish eyes, And they bold wanton fire, on every She Whom Beauty's Wealth commended for a Prize. The Chariot's Haste he curs'd, and he alone, From's Sin's fair fuel loth to part so soon. 106 Perch'd on a Vultur's back was Rapine, who In length of Tallons did that Bird exceed; Starv'd with Desire, though fat in Spoils, she so Tormented was, that with more headlong Speed She wish'd her Queen would march, that at the Feast Of British Plunder she might be a Guest. 107 Upon an Ostrich, more unnatural Than barbarous She, rode meagre Astorgy, Vowing aloud to tear in sunder all Those Cords with which true Love delights to tie The Souls of Parents, and of Children; and Shatter the links of every Nuptial Band. 108 High-mounted on an Hydra, Heresy With more and stranger heads than had her Steed; Rejoyc'd in hope that now contagious She Her Poison to another World should spread; And Albion's Sands, which bridled in the Sea, Should by her stouter Tide o'rflowed be. 109 A black and grizly Dog bore Profanation: Her who ne'r learnt Distinction of Place, Of Time, or Things; who never yet could fashion A modest Look, or paint a Blush's Grace; Whose Rudeness no more reverence affords To holy Altars, than to Dresser-boards. 110 Bold Sacrilege sate pertly on a Kite; And though her Claws were burnt, and sing'd her Wings E'r since the Altar might have taught her Wit, (For vengeful Coals stuck to the sacred Things, Branding the saucy Thief,) yet shameless She A-robbing Heav'n and God again would be. 111 Upon a Serpent bred in Hell beneath, Which belch'd rank fire at every step he took, Which reached Heav'n with his pestiferous breath, Which fought with holy Incense by the smoke Of his foul Throat; rode desperate Blasphemy, And dared all the way Divinity. 112 But on an Heifer of Egyptian race, Right proud of his renown'd Descent (for he The Heir of Apis and of Isis was,) Sate full as gross a Brute, Idolatry: And yet Devoto's, grosser than her Beast, Or She, about her with their Offrings prest. 113 And this was Persecution's princely Train; Which all the way she went, stroke mortal fright Into the Countries, travelling in Pain, As she in Triumph; till her rushing Flight Her, and their Fears far out of sight had born, And bad them from their Dens and Caves return. 114 Poor Albion thrice started as she drew Near to the shore, and would have further run Into the Sea: but now the Tyrant flew With cursed Joy and snatch'd possession Of her unhappy Isle; where dreadful she Took up her Quarters in a Colony. 115 A strange Amusement on all hearts did seize, And each Man chew'd his own misgiving Thoughts: None durst have courage by Discourse to ease The heavy burden of his labouring Doubts. 'Twixt nearest Friend and Friend Suspicion thrust, And Jealousy devour'd all dearest Trust. 116 When lo, She issued out her Proclamations Of Pardon unto All who would come in: But sour'd that Sweetness by stern Denuntiations To those who still continued in their Sin; Who wasted still their Piety upon The Carpenter's poor Crucified Son. 117 She summon'd all the Isle to Reformation, That mighty Jove, by whose high blessing She Reign'd Empress of the World, in worthy fashion, And like his sovereign Self, might worship'd be; And mov'd to shower his fattest Favors down, And Albion with Peace and Plenty crown. 118 For by her royal Declaration She All Blastings, Mildews, Droughts, Plagues, Earthquakes, Wars, Charg'd soly upon Christianity; Which impious Sect, said she, so boldly dares The Wrath of all the Gods, that righteous They On stubborn Earth must needs this Vengeance lay. 119 Forthwith, all Those whose bosoms tainted were With rank Idolatry's mad Venom, grew Luxuriously glad the News to hear; And with immediate rampant Confluence flew To do their homage, and their thanks prefer Ev'n in the Name of succoured Jove to Her. 120 Then They, who could have lov'd safe Piety Yet durst no more than faint cold Virtue own; They in whose Hearts the World and Self did lie As well as Jesus; they who would have drawn In th'Evangelick Yoke with patience, so Mean while their secular Plough might also go; 121 They who conceiv'd, for Wives' and Children's sake Depending soley on their Love and Care, (So dreamt the faithless Fondlings) they might make A little bold with God; and They who were Flatter'd with hopes that Heav'n's propitious Eye Would wink at what they held Necessity; 122 Came in the rear, like Men who scarcely came, For not so much as half their Minds were there: In Evening's guilty Vail they clok'd their Shame Which honest Day's clear-judging eye did fear; Whilst to escape the Tyrant's Condemnation Themselves condemn their own Dissimulation. 123 But they whose Loyalty stood firm and sound, They who to Love intirely were resigned, Such potent Sweetness in his Service found As scorn'd all Hate with bloody Power combin'd: Such Sweetness as inforced to be sweet That Gall which flow'd in Persecution's Threat. 124 Sooner will they be charmed by the Hiss Of Dragons, into their fell Dens to go; Than be persuaded to accept of this So treacherous and destructive Pardon; No Whate'r they loose, they from their Loss will reap This noble Gain, that they themselves will keep. 125 Their Life, Limbs, Fame, Estate, and Liberty They can more eas'ly than their Conscience spare: They nothing count their own, which cannot be Without Impiety possest; and are Content with any Thing but God to part, Who only can secure them their own Heart. 126 Psyche was one, and not the meanest one Of these brave Champions; who since Phylax had By Heav'n's disposal left her now alone, Her meek Addresses to Uranius made: An holy Priest was He, and unto Her An Oracle in any Doubt or Fear. 127 To You, said She, my reverend Father, I Now Persecution's furious Storms arise, As to my wise and faithful Pilot flie; Not to be steered where Calamities May never reach my Vessel, but to know The nearest way how I to them may row. 128 Forbid it genuine Love, that I should flie The noblest Testimony I can give, Of my O how deserved Loyalty To my great Spouse, for whom alone I live: For Him I live; and must that Truth deny If in his Quarel I refuse to die. 129 For was not His ten thousand times more dear And precious than my Life? yet generous He His heart-blood's utmost Drop stuck not to spare Ev'n for the worst of Worms, vile sinful Me: Loud cries the Merit of this Blood, and I Though oft I dy'd for Him, in debt should die. 130 And should I shrink from one poor Death, what Eye Would not shoot Wrath at such Unthankfulness? How should I hate my self, and strive to die For shame of Fearing Death? yet I confess This wretched Life's so mean a thing, that We By Martyrdom do Heav'n no courtesy. 131 Mine all the Gains will be: nor know I how To 'scape this Profit; which could I but shun, More Solace from my Death to me would flow, And to the Stake I cheerlyer should run. But since that may not be; since Bliss is still To Suffrings ty'd, let Love enjoy his Will. 132 Let Love assert his own Magnificence, And make us for our very Service be Deeper in Debt; yet surely I will hence Revenge me of his Liberality, And do my best to run upon the score With this great Creditor for evermore. 133 But grave Uranius, who was deeper read I'th' cool sage Gospel Discipline, reply'd; The fire by which those Flames of thine are bred Is pure and genuine; but they blaze too wide: Dear Daughter be content, and think that I Can wish and dare, as well as you, to Die. 134 Though I were courted by secure Delight And Glory's Complement to live and breath: My feeble Age would stronglier me invite To take my rest in any Bed of Death: But since no Baits allure me here to stay, O how much worse than Death, is Death's Delay! 135 Yet must no headlong Haste of mine prevent My Sovereign's Pleasure, who, for ought I know, Desires Uranius should rest content To wrestle still with Sorrows here below; Still to be exil'd from the blessed Sight Of His dear Eyes, and grovel here in Night. 136 Besides, if I before his Call should run, This hot Impatience might outstrip his Grace: And where should feeble I, thus left alone, Find Courage to outlook the dreadful Face Of Death, when dress'd in martial Array He gives the Onset to my Dust and Clay? 137 Will any General thank that Captain who Without Commission has presum'd to fight? Into the Lists if any Pris'ner go On Tigres or on Bears to try his might Till thither forc'd; what Eye will grieve to see His torn limbs pay for his Temerity? 138 Is't not enough, if when we challeng'd are, We flinch not from maintaining, That his Name Doth in our bosoms sit more near and dear Than Life it self? mean while ne'r think it shame To balk the tempest, which will soon retrieve Thy Heav'n and Thee, if Jesus gives it leave. 139 As some young Soldier, who was more on fire Than his fierce sparkling Steed, the Charge to give, When by some old Commander his Desire As rash and perillous, doth a Curb receive, Finds it an harder Conflict to subdue His single self, than all his hostile Crew: 140 So Psyche crossed in her venturous way By that grave bulk of her sage Priest's Advice, Feels it an heavy troublous Task to stay, And shun the winning of her dearest Prize: Yet knowing He was wiser far than she, Bravely she yields, and gains self-victory. 141 Uranius well remembring now how He, Then young and shiftless, by his Parents was Into a Nest of silent Privacy, Whose Avenue lay through a Desert's maze, Hurry'd by night, when such a storm as this Into the Britain Hemisphere did press: 142 Thither, when Ev'n had muffled up the Eye Of Heav'n, and those of Earth, he Psyche led; And by a Lanthorn which would not descry More than He pleas'd, his journey governed: Till at the Cavern they arrived, where Cheerly he bad the Maid be of good cheer. 143 It is no new Adventure, this, said He, But practis'd and well-season'd to thine hand: Moses, that Man of God, was glad to flee, And wander up and down a foreign Land. With hungrier sp[r]ight no Partridge ever on The hills was chas'd, than Jesse's holy Son. 144 Noble Elijah in the Desert hid His persecuted head, when Jezebel, Our Tyrant's Type, her threatnings thundered Against his Life: there chose this Saint to dwell, Supplyed with no Caterer or Cook, But only Ravens, no Cellar, but a Brook. 145 Nay mighty Jesus too himself did flie When bloody Herod drew his desperate Sword: And never think it can discredit thy Devotion, to follow Him thy Lord In any of his steps, who is alone The way which leads to all Perfection. 146 Whilst thus the sober Priest encourag'd Her: A Troop of furious Soldiers had by night Beset their houses, in presumption there To catch their ready Prey: but when their flight They understood, their frustrate Expectation Flam'd into most impatient Vexation. 147 All Rooms they ransak'd, where what Goods they met Were hungry Plunder's instant Sacrifice: Yet still their Rage unsatisfied, set The Houses too on fire; with barbarous Cries Threatning like vengeance to their Owners, when Justice could hunt them from their secret Den. 148 If any of the Neighbours, wounded by The salvage Spectacle, but smote their breast, Or shak'd their head, or mourned in a sigh; The salvage Caytifs took it for Confest That to their Queen they ill-affected were, And them with rayling Cries to Prison tare. 149 Yet, by the way, the cruel Courtesy Of hungry Thieves they frankly offer'd Them; Who ready were their Lives and Liberty With present sums of Money to redeem. Their Queen is safe enough, so They can line Their greedy Coffers with Delinquents' Coin. 150 Which having gain'd, they set their Pris'ners free; Free to new Rapine, giving Information Of their Religious Delinquency To other Plunderers; who with fresh Invasion On their fat Booties seize, whose Guilt is sure To last as long's their Purses' Springs endure. 151 But through the Eastern ruby Portals now Aurora op'd the passage to the Day; When lo, an old and shaggy Lyon, who Had busy been all night about his prey, Came panting home, and with a mighty Roar Proclaim'd his entrance at his Cavern's door. 152 This was that Cavern where for shelter lay The good Uranius and Psyche, who Rous'd by the Noise, but destitute of way To flie the presence of their hideous Fo; Their hearts to Heav'n with instant fervor sent, Imploring Succour in this Peril's dint. 153 In rush'd the Beast, whose dreadful Mouth and Paw Still reeked with his worried Bootie's blood: But those unlook'd-for Guests when there he saw, Stroke with the awful News a while he stood, And as he wistly view'd, he smooth'd his frown And by degrees his Crest and Tail let down. 154 Uranius musing what the Lyon meant To melt from his stern self, thus him bespake: If He who is our Lord and thine, hath sent Thee hither with Commission to take Our lives by gentler Tyranny than that From which we fled, lo we deny them not. 155 Much Solace it will be to Us that We Augment not by our deaths the Guilt of Men; This bloody Trade far better suits with Thee, Of Salvageness the dreadful Sovereign, than With them whose softer Tempers to the key Of mild Compassion should tuned be. 156 Yet if Thou dost not on Heav'n's Errand come, But on the bus'ness of thy barbarous Thirst; Unarmed though we be, no Peril from Thy Paws or Jaws we dread; do all thy worst. So faithful He, and so said Psyche too, And waited what the Beast would dare to do. 157 When lo, the trusty generous Lyon, who No Vengeance ought to Men but where he saw The print of Guilt and of Rebellion to Their common Sovereign, right meekly threw Himself before these Saints; in whom he read The Lines of Innocence so fairly spread. 158 (Thus his ingenuous Forefathers, when Great Daniel at their Hunger's mercy lay, Permitted Him to reign in their own Den; And stuck not to his Sanctity to pay Their couchant Tribute, though their stomachs' Cry Mean while alarm'd their fierce Rapacity.) 159 Then having humbly lick'd their holy feet, And seem'd to beg their Blessings e'r he went; What universal Providence finds meet And useful for thy Modestie's content, Uranius cry'd, may it bestowed be In due requital of thy Piety. 160 Forthwith the joyful Lyon took his leave, With all the manners his rude Education Could teach his joints; which sight made Psyche grieve, Reflecting with a tender Meditation On those unmanly Men from whom she fled, Who did the wildest Beasts in Rage exceed. 161 And well she might; for lo, a trusty friend Both to the Priest and Her, who knew the place Where now they lurk'd, his way did thither rend With Ashes on his head and Grief in's face: And enter'd there, a while he silent stood, And eas'd his Passion in a weeping flood. 162 Then prefacing with Groans, Alas, he cry'd, That I have liv'd to bring this deadly News! Your selves have by your flight escap'd the Tide Of Salvageness which all our Town imbrues: But nothing else; for what behind you left, The Booty is of most outrageous Theft. 163 Your Houses, turn'd to their own funeral pile, Now in their Ashes lie—. Vast Sorrow here Stifeled the rest. But then, thy story's stile To Us is not so dreadful; never fear That what remains, will torture Us, replies The Priest, who dare embrace our miseries. 164 Whate'r was ours, thou know'st, We never Made, But by our Lord's Donation did possess: Since all we had, we but as Stewards had, Well may our Master call for what was His. And blessed be His Name, who Us from these Incumbrances is pleased to release. 165 Chidden by this heroick Bravery, The Messenger took heart, and thus went on: Had furious Tyranny presum'd to fly No higher than at you, and yours, alone; Tears might have reach'd that Loss; but now her Rage With the Most High adventures War to wage. 166 The desperate Caytifs feared not to break Into the sacred Oratory (where Our bus'ness we with Heav'n dispatch'd, for lack Of publick safety for our Rites,) and there Made Hellish havock, challenging, in spight, God for His Temple and Himself to fight. 167 The sacred Volumes they no sooner saw, But cry'd, in atheistick scorn, Behold These odious Galileans' lawless Law, Which boldly breaks all Statutes else, enroll'd Either in Cesar's books, or Jove's: but We Will try if this may now not broken be. 168 Forthwith they madly tore it leaf by leaf; Here Moses tatter'd lay, the Prophets there: But on the Evangelick Part their chief Revenge they pour'd, and, as they able were Massacred patient Christ again, and rent Him in the Body of his Testament. 169 Which done; upon Religion's next support, And grave Devotion's Rule, the Liturgy, They made their equally-malicious sport: Crying, These are those Leaves of Witchery, That bulk of Conjurations and Charms, To which the whole World ows its present Harms. 170 Next, all the Altar's reverend furniture They snatch'd, and scrambled who should rifle most; The sacerdotal Vestments, white and pure, About the room at first in scorn they tost; And then with them array'd their gamesome selves, Acting in Lambs' mild fleeces, murderous Wolves. 171 Upon the Chalice, when they had espyed The Shepherd bringing home the strayed sheep, All in an hell-combined Clamor cryed, Look how those Christians set their God to keep Their Wine: but fools, they should have hir'd a friend Who might his Godship from our hands defend. 172 Is not our Pan more like a God, than this? Pan, who the Shepherds selves has power to keep, Whilst this poor servile Thing contented is To spend his foolish time on silly sheep. But since He's here of Silver, in our need His Deity may stand us in some stead. 173 When in these Contumelies they their fill Had wantoniz'd; one ill-look'd Soldier brings A black Dog's carkase, which (O wit of Hell!) He scornfully upon the Altar flings; And with blasphemous supplication, cries, Accept, O Christ, my bounden Sacrifice. 174 Then said another, we must not forget Humbly to tender our Drinkoffring too. With that, upon the Altar thrice he spit, And having fill'd a putrified shoe With his vile Urine, on his bended knee He pour'd out his foul Impiety. 175 But then a Third, to make their Crime complete, Yelling and rayling, set the Place on fire. For since, said he, this Jesus is so great A Deity, his Godship may require An Holocaust: which word, and Act, the Rout Applauded with an universal shout. 176 No more, cry'd here Uranius; O forbear Till we have pour'd out our due Tears for this. That Jesus, and his Temple wronged are, Our Sins, and ours alone, the reason is: Our Breach of His Commandments is the Gap Which let into His House this foul Mishap. 177 This said; the reins to pious Lamentation Both He and Psyche liberally gave. When lo, a strong and mixt Vociferation Conquer'd their Cries, and triumph'd in the Cave: Some Huntsmen's Noise it seemed in their ear; And right they guess'd, for these Men-hunters were. 178 It prov'd that Rout, who when they mist the Priest At his own house, concluded he was fled, And in the Desert sought some private Nest, Wherein to hide his persecuted head. But they all bent and sworn to hunt him out, A Pack of Bloodhounds for the purpose brought. 179 As up and down these trac'd the Solitude, A busy Cur the Cavern did surround. And having caught the wished sent, persu'd It close till he these holy Weepers found; Whom spying, wide he opened, and howl'd Till he to all the Rabble tales had toll'd. 180 This brought them tumbling thither: where when they Beheld Uranius, with a barbarous Cry Up went their Voice and Hands to pull Dismay Down on their Pris'ner; whom forthwith they tie To that grim Hound which him retriev'd, that he Might his contemptible Conducter be. 181 The reverend Captive knew it was in vain To ask their madness why it us'd him so; Or what Offence of his had earn'd that Chain Which bound him to such ignominious Wo; He was not now to learn, that sober Reason By this Committee would be voted Treason. 182 In patient silence he attends their spight, Ready to stay, or go, to live, or die; Not doubting but in Persecution's sight To yield's the surest way to Victory. Thus harmless Lambs are in their Suff'rings mute, And never with the Butcher's Knife dispute. 183 As Psyche at his back lamenting stood, One who pretended to have something still Of Man and Kindness, bad her stop that flood, Which poor seduced She amiss did spill; And never weep to see Him Pris'ner there, Who by Enchantments had enslaved Her. 184 For this your lurking, and your wailing here, Tell us He hath bewitch'd you into his Ridiculous Religion's yoak: yet were It only such, said he, we would not press The Law against him; but the wide World knows That it with Crimes as well as Follies flows. 185 This old Ringleader of the Sect will we To justice sacrifice: but as for you, Whose Guilt we hope is but Simplicity, To your less fault we Pardon will allow: And to your silly Servant here, if He Henceforth will be content more Wise to be. 186 Psyche with silent and with sad Disdain Threw back his Courtesy into his face: For though her heart at present did refrain To speak it self, yet she resolved was: Resolved not to leave her friend that day Though Death and Devils blocked up her way. 187 And now the raging Miscreants tore the Priest Back to the Town with shameless Exclamations, And all the way his Patience opprest With Kicks, and Stripes, and Taunts, and Accusations; Which sad Procession reached to the Place Where their Tribunal high-erected was. 188 A Deputy of Persecution there Upon the Bench with ready Malice sate; Full on whose face an Altar looked, where Prepared Coals did glowing lie; and at The shrine stood one with Incense in his hand To wait upon the Deputy's Command. 189 Uranius thus presented at the Bar; The Judge begins an insolent Oration, In which his spight had took sufficient Care To blast, and to blaspheme the Christian nation; To whose sole Charge he loudly layed all The Miseries which did that Age befall. 190 Nor those alone (his Sovereign's Declaration Had thus far ly'd,) but all that Calumny Could possibly invent; the Combination Of bloody and unclean Impiety, Which made the Gnosticks' Name so horrid, He Avow'd the Christian Discipline to be. 191 His Praise advanc'd his Gods unto the skies, (A place which they, alas, could never reach,) But heap'd on Christ all slanderous Injuries Which Envy could suggest, or Hell could teach. And at each period the People's Roar Pour'd proud Applause upon their Orator. 192 But in the Close, he gravely turn'd his speech With cruel Pity to Uranius; Whom by his reverend Age he did beseech No longer to be fool'd and cheated thus By silly Wickedness, but choose their odds Who offer'd him for One a Troop of Gods. 193 He wonder'd why he should not much prefer The Deities all Nations did adore, Before the single simple Carpenter Who found no Worship but amongst a poor Few sneaking and despised Souls, which He (Vain God) could not protect from Misery. 194 With earnest looks he then conjur'd him to Remember what was done at Calvary; Who there was mock'd, and pierc'd, and nailed; who Expired there on Shame's and Torment's Tree; And not with desperate Sottishness lay down His life for Him who could not save His own. 195 But if he still refused to present Incense to Jove, he bad him strait expect The most severe Excess of Punishment Which scorn'd and anger'd Mercy could inflict. This said; with anxious and greedy eye He gaped for Uranius his Reply. 196 But He right brave Defiance to return Upon the crafty Judge's hated love, Cry'd out, Much sooner I my self will burn, Than Incense to an Idol: could you prove Your favor would not surely me destroy, I it would hug with humble thanks and joy. 197 But Sir, Uranius is assur'd that They On whom you thrust the Names of Deities, Are weaker far than we poor things of Clay; And that the Carpenter you so despise Is He who fram'd both You and Me, and all The fabrick of this universal Ball. 198 And His revenging Arm it is which now Lasheth the World with those Calamities Whose guilt on our Religion's shoulders you So freely threap: your own Idolatries Force Him to Justice, who had rather be Known unto all this World by Lenity. 199 Would He think fit to rescue me, it is Not all your Power, or your Queen's, can stand Against his might: But if I must by His Most just, be left to your tyrannick Hand; His Pleasure dearer is than life to Me; I dread not Death, but dread Apostasy. 200 No Sea repulsed by a solid Rock E'r swell'd and foam'd with more disdainful Wrath; Than now the Judge, to hear the Pris'ner mock So solemnly his Gods and Him, and Death. Then let him Burn, he cry'd; since he denies To offer, make him be, Jove's Sacrifice. 201 The Soldiers, who were much afraid least He Should have embrac'd the Judge's profer'd Grace, Rejoyc'd and clap'd their cursed hands to see That to their Rage He now condemned was. Away they drag him to the stake, and there A fort of fagots round about him rear. 202 Then with a Brand from Jove's high Altar brought, The Pile they kindle, and blow up the flame: Which as it rose, they bellow'd out their shout: May such Revenge those stubborn Dotards tame, Who scorning to the mighty Gods to yield, Their trust on Crucified Jesus build. 203 But mild Uranius having kiss'd the stake, And every fagot which his lips could reach; At leasure was his noble Prayers to make For Pardon for his Murderers' fury, which Blinded with Superstition's veil, alas, Perceived not what part it Acting was. 204 Then purer than the flame, and brighter far, Which mounted from his Pile, his Soul did fly: It higher flew than That, and gain'd the sphere Not of the Stars, but of felicity; Where it was welcom'd to its final Home By Martyrdom's illustrious Diademe. 205 So when brave Gold hath by the cruelty Of an incensed furnace been refined; Its genuine substance is allow'd to be Crowned, and with th'Imperial Image signed; Free leave and full authority it has Current through all its Sovereign's Realm to pass. 206 Psyche, whose sympathetick heart attended Upon this holy Tragick-comedy, No sooner saw how gloriously it ended, But gravid with her pious Plaudit, she, Forgetful of the furious standers by, Thus eas'd her Soul's exultant Ecstasy: 207 Go, valiant Saint, thy Conquest is complete; Go where immortal Laurel ready is With endless Honor thy bright brows to meet; Go and possess thy Master's Realm of Bliss: Thy Name and fame shall reverend be beneath So long as Piety on Earth shall breath. 208 Happy, most happy Thou, who art supply'd Ev'n by thy Foes with this fair Chariot, in Whose flaming Glories thou hast leave to ride To those which in the Empyreum shine: Well might'st thou pray their sin be not imputed To them, who thee to Heav'n have persecuted. 209 O that poor Psyche might the grace obtain, Though at the price of all the World's worst spight, To kiss thy glorious feet, and bear thy Train In thy triumphant March! O that I might Through all thy hottest flames climb after thee, And from this mortal Dross refined be? 210 This high-strain'd Air full well beseemed Her, And in all holy Ears good musick made; But no flat Discord could more grate and jar Upon the Soldiers, whose professed Trade Was how to tune their Curses to a Key Of wild impetuous Importunity. 211 And how intolerable they esteem This note of hers, they make her fully feel; For first they vote her to be Furie's Game, And then with barbarous haste kick, tear and hale Her to the Judge's Bar; in hopes that He Their bloody Hunger's Caterer would be. 212 Here they exclaim, that this bold Woman was As manly as the Priest in Wickedness; That she nor fear'd nor blush'd to make his Case Heav'n's quarrel, and his cursed Death to bless; And so must needs as guilty be as He Of sin's Perfection, Christianity. 213 Yea of the rankest foulest part of it; Witness the shelter of the Night and Cave, An advantageous Circumstance, and fit For none but Lust's black work: And now you have Just Sir, said they, arraigned here before Your righteous Seat a Christian and a Whore. 214 But She, commanded by the Judge to make Her own Apologie, (which best, said he, Will be evinc'd, if you that Censer take And choke with holy smoke all Calumny,) With elevated Eyes thank'd Heav'n for this Occasion to ascend unto her Bliss. 215 Embraving then her face with gallant Joy, And like a Champion ready for the fight, Or some bright Queen who gilds her nuptial Day, Or Venus whose pure lustre silvers Night, Or brisk Aurora garnishing the Morn, Or goodly Ceres traversing her Corn. 216 Or rather like that glorious Deacon who First op'd the ruby Gate of Martyrdom, Whom sweet and princely beams imbellish'd so That Heav'n it self aforehand seem'd to come And perch upon his face, which to his Foes An Angel's Count'nance did in Man's disclose; 217 She thus began: No Confutation I But Thanks alone to my Accusers owe, Who charge on me no vulgar Piety, But rank me with Uranius, and allow That simple I deserve no less than He With Martyrdom's fair Palms adorn'd to be. 218 Indeed 'tis my Ambition's Aim that I May but appear as deep ingrain'd as He In what you fondly count Guilt's ugly Die: And since their malice hath befriended me Above my merit, I am loth to lose What is so freely granted by my Foes. 219 But that part of their spight which call'd me Whore Foully mistaketh my Delights and Me; For might I choose my flames, for evermore In all Hell's sulphur I would fryed be, Rather than hatch a Thought of giving way That lust's black fire should make my heart its Prey. 220 But how have I demean'd my self, that you Wise Sir, should think this wretched Life to me Can seem more precious than the faith I owe To Him who can from Death's Captivity Redeem His Subjects, and a course will take Uranius from his Ashes out to rake. 221 If e'r this Tongue of mine was known to spill The least Consent or seeming Approbation Of you or of your Gods, (which sure my Will Was never privy to,) this Detestation May wipe it off, and make my Guilt as clear As my Accusers wish it may appear. 222 Your Jove's no more, nay not so much to Me As you, or as the meanest Wight that lives: He to your fancies ow's his Deity, And from your Superstition receives His several shapes: and therefore well may you Be bold with him, and what you please allow. 223 Sometimes a Bull must serve, sometimes a Swan For King of Gods and Men; sometimes a shower Of Gold, and, when you kindest are, a Man: But such a Man, as wast's his Godship's Power In Lust and Luxury; that politick ye May by your God's Example Wicked be. 224 And must I lavish Incense to perfume His Name, the Name of filths and Stinks? must I His wretched Vileness to content presume On Jesu's pure and mighty Majesty? No: Him indeed I fear, but dread not you; Which with my life I ready am to show. 225 I grant Corruption is my Pedegree, And Worms my kindred; yet I must have leave To think my self too noble still to be Your God's Devoto: O do not deceive Your selves in vain; my Essence real is, And therefore may not worship forgeries. 226 Were I as foul as Slander's thoughts of me, Were I the worst of horrid Things, a Whore; I see not why your goodly Piety Should not forthwith convince you to Adore My Wickedness and Me, unless you dare Your Venus from her Goddeship debar. 227 What Perfica, Pertunda, Mutunus, What Cyprian Rites, what Ithyphallies, mean, What sacred sport old Baubo's glorious Invention made to cheer up Harvest's Queen, You and your Temples know: but pardon me If I abhor to name such Villany. 228 No: it shall never stain this Tongue of mine This Tongue, whose Homage is intirely due To Jesu's Name; that Name of most divine Unspotted Sweetness: doubt not Sir, although I am a feeble Female, His dear Sake My Resolution Masculine can make. 229 It can, and will; and if you find to day That Jove, or greater you, can make me start From what becomes his faithful Champion, say Jesus has Psyche's Tongue, but none her Heart. This said: with hopes of deadly Tortures fill'd, On her grim Judge's face she nobly smil'd. 230 But He, deep stung by this most stout Reply, And highly scorning to acknowledge in A Woman such heroick Constancy, With envious Cunning cry'd, now have I seen Enough to quit lowd Fame from any Lie Which charg'd such Charms on Christianity. 231 If every silly Soul inchanted were With fauning Superstition's Witchery, This obstinate and retchless Maiden here Is Captive to that curs'd Impiety; Being so monstrously transform'd, that to The Gods and her own Self she's open Foe. 232 But must We rage because this Wench is mad? Perhaps her Spell's of short extent, and she Tam'd by a Prison's Hardship, may be glad To turn into her self again, and be Content (which may the Gods vouchsafe to grant!) Her Blasphemy and Boldness to recant. 233 Great Jove, who heard when she did him defy, Forbore to fling his Lightning at her head; And by that sweet and heav'nly Lenity, Of Patience to Us a Lecture read. To Prison with her, and instruct her by New Chains to quit these Bands of Witchery. 234 Laden with Irons, but much more with scorn, Poor Psyche thus unto the Jayl is led; And in a dungeon gloomy and forlorn (That she might doubly be imprisoned,) Cruelly plung'd: where as she 'gan to sink Into the nasty Mire, she wak'd the Stink. 235 A Stink which might disdain what Arabie And all its Odors could against it do: An aged Stink, which in that Sordid stie Had mellowing lain; for it was long agoe Since any Foot disquieted the Heap Of pois'nous Lothsomness which there did sleep. 236 Fast in this Torment stuck, afflicted She No succour could receive from any Friend: The Jaylor barr'd out all Their Piety Who long'd to give what He deny'd to lend, And only once a day his Pris'ner fed With puddle Water and more dirty Bread. 237 Yet harder than this Diet, was the Grace He duly said: Repent, unhappy Wretch, Repent, he cry'd: why should this odious Place Be dearer to thee, than the Favor which The gentle Judge hath offer'd thee, if thou With Him, and our great Queen, to Jove wilt bow? 238 These curs'd importunate Preachments sorely grated Upon the bowels of her Soul, who in This woful Leisure deeply meditated Upon the Age's most contagious Sin; Which now with zealous superstition rung From her destructive Keeper's pitying Tongue. 239 No Member e'r with softer Sympathy The Wounds of its fraternal Part could feel, Than she that deadly-spreading Malady Which now had tainted Albion's Commonweal; And like the Plague indeed, into the Heart Its desperate Poison did directly dart. 240 Inestimable Souls (for such the Price Which Jesus paid, demonstrates them to be,) Their own illustrious Value did despise, Selling themselves to poor Idolatry; And at no higher rate, than to escape Some worldly Shame, and temporal Mishap. 241 Their dear Redeemer's most transcendent Love They kick'd and scorned and his Heav'n with it; And spent their Service on ignoble Jove, Although no Guerdon but the lowest Pit Of everflaming Torments did attend them, Where ev'n that Jove himself no help could lend them. 242 This pierc'd her Soul so deep, that she should give Her Life ten thousand times to Death, might she But at that cost be able to reprieve Or Friends or Foes from this mad misery. But seeing this unfeasible, the sight Doubled her sorrow's heart-oppressing weight. 243 This fair Advantage envious Satan took To work upon her rocky Constancy, Trusting his Art at length would her provoke To kiss the Judge's offer'd Courtesy; He hop'd that Desolation gall'd by Grief Would stoop at last, and not disdain Relief. 244 And yet her charitable Meditation Highly displeas'd him; wherefore crafty He Resolv'd perforce to knit her Contemplation Close to her own new-sprung Calamity; For all her Veins with angry Flames he fill'd, Till into burning Pearls and Boils they swell'd. 245 Her skin, so soft, and white, and sleck before, All rugged now with odious Tumors is: From head to foot one universal Sore Arrays her round in a tormenting Dress; A Dress which Vzze's patient Prince of old He forc'd to wear instead of Robes of gold. 246 Yet on dry Ashes He had leave to sit, And with a Potsherd scrape his scurfy skin: A Comfort Psyche's Fate would not permit, Who stuck beneath that Help, a Captive in The thick relentless Mire; where she is fain To rub her torturing Tumors with her Chain. 247 She rub'd, and every Rub did but inrage The fretful Sores to higher swelling Pain; Whose fury for the present to asswage She rub'd, and so augmented it again. O deplorable Wight, whose only Ease Is her own flaming Anguish to increase! 248 And yet these Torments less tormenting were Than those which now her Parents' treacherous Love Heap'd on her wounded Soul: the Judge's ear, And then his Leave they gain'd, to come and prove What their Persuasions with their Child could do; And cunningly they did their bus'ness too. 249 For on the Dungeon's brink their Lamentation They poured first, and then this charming Cry: Psyche, O Psyche, If thy Tribulation Be yet too weak to make thee bow to thy Own Ease and Quiet; let thy Parents' Grief At least, by thy Consent, obtain Releif. 250 The Staff of our decrepit years art Thou, Sole Thou, dear Daughter; all our Joys in Thee Are fresh and young: O do not rob us now Of that by which we live, thy Liberty: Thy Liberty, which we would rather choose By any Hand than by thine own to loose. 251 The Judge would yield thee back to Us again, And wilt thou Cruel be when He is kind? By thee have we deserved to be slain Who from our Foes such generous Pity find? Though thine own Life thou strangely scornest, yet Abhor not Ours to whom thou owest it. 252 Surely thy Christ, if he as gentle be, As thou didst vaunt him for, will never praise That wilful and unnatural Piety Which both thine own and Parents' lives betrays. O no: our common Lord we also know, And honor his Compassion more than thou. 253 Our Faith in his abundant Mercy makes Us, till this boistrous Storm abates, Comply. His Eye, which through all Hearts its Prospect takes, Beholds that Ours pant still with Loyalty To him and his dear Laws; and therefore He Propitious to our ou[t]side-fault will be. 254 To Peter's Tongue, though fould with three Denyals, 'Cause still his Heart was clean, he pardon gave: And doubt not thou but since thy present Tryals More dreadful are than His, thy Lips may have Leave to be bold for once, if still thy Breast In Loyalty to Jesus doth persist. 255 O force not then thine own Destruction! Accept of what thou surely ought'st to crave; Whilst yet it shines, enjoy the courteous Sun, And let this Dungeon not forestal thy Grave. Speak, speak, and bid Us Live with Thee; or by Thy willful Silence, send Us home to Dy. 256 So pleaded they: but Psyche with a Sigh Fetch'd deeper than the bottom of her Grot, Sounded the woful Charge, and valiantly With this athletick Answer vanquish'd what Artillery their crafty Tongues had brought From Piety's strong-Hold to force her out. 257 I now no longer can the Jaylor blame Who tempted me my Liberty to gain By being Slave to Jove's accursed Name, And scorning Him who on Heav'n's throne doth reign: Why should I look that Pagan He, to Me Should kinder than my Christian Parents be? 258 If yet you dare that holy Title wear, Who antichristianly invite me now To kick at Christ. Alas, that I appear, So execrable in your eyes, that you (As if this Dungeon here were shallow grown,) Into Hell's Gulf should strive to plunge me down! 259 The sacred Law of Filial Duty I Hold dearer than this World: for well I know (Nor shall all Torments force me to deny This Truth,) that unto you my Life I ow; Which in your Service if I ever fear To spend, then may I prove Idolater. 260 But that's the Life by which I Pris'ner am In Earth's unworthy Jayl: a Life I have Much truer to its active noble Name; A Life so precious, that to reprieve It from the Jaws of endless Death, his own The King of Kings vouchsafed to lay down. 261 That Life I mean by which my Soul doth live; A Life which from your Loins I never drew: O call not then for what you did not give, Nor think that this is to your Pleasure due. God is my only Parent here, and I Intire to him must keep my Loyalty. 262 As fast as in this Mire I stick, the Way Of His Commands I running am: and though Your Prayers or Necks you in my Path should lay To barricado up my Race; yet now I would not hear my Mortal Duty plead, But on your Necks and Prayers freely tread. 263 Yet Heav'n forbid I should be forc'd to take This hard Experiment of Piety! O rather help to haste me to the Stake And of my Combat there Spectators be: You'l ne'r repent that you your Child, though in A Coach of Flames, to Heav'n have mounting seen. 264 But since you know so well the vast extent Of Jesu's Mercy, know it not in vain: Your own decrepit years bid you repent With speediest speed: and that deep-dyed stain Of your Idolatrous Compliance dares The utmost Power of your fullest Tears. 265 This is the properest Use your souls can make Of Peter's signal Case; his triple Sin No warrant for Presumption is to take His faithless Course; but his repentant Brine Shews to all sinful Eyes, what Waters are Able to purge such stains, and quench Despair. 266 Mispend not then those precious Beads on me; Your Selves need all their ornament: and I This only Favor crave, that you would be But so courageous yet, as to rely On Heav'n's Protection. Speak, O speak, and ease My throbbing heart's tormenting Jealousies. 267 I burn, I burn in Anguish, till I hear You by a stout Profession defy Those Baits of secular ignoble Fear Which strangely lur'd you to Apostasy. Speak then, and make my Life grow sweet, in spight Of all these Tortures which against it fight. 268 So pious She. But feeble-hearted They Rendring no Answer but a faithless sigh, Their griefs and fears to witness, went their way, Confounded by their Daughter's Constancy. Yet by this foul Retreat they gave her more Soul-piercing Wounds, than did their Charge before. 269 For now her ominous Meditations threw Her down into that Gulf of flaming Pain Which to Apostate Wickedness was due; Where every Torment, every Rack and Chain To which her Parents seem'd condemned now, A Sea of Woe into her bosom threw. 270 So vast a Sea, as drowned all the Sense Of her own overflowing Pangs; and she Is quite transformed by the Violence Of tender but self-cruel Sympathy Into their imminent Condition, where She underwent what she for them did fear. 271 But as she strugled to maintain this Fight Of mighty Charity, at length she fainted; When lo, a sudden unexpected Light (A thing with which that Grot had ne'r acquainted,) The Place, and Her, with Glory did surprise, Off'ring a radiant Stranger to her eyes. 272 For she beheld at her right hand a Maid On whose fair head a diamond Crown did shine: With gentle Majesty she was array'd, And all her Ornaments appear'd divine. Which Sight amazed Psyche so, that she Hasted to wellcom't on her bended knee. 273 But as her Soreness, Mire, and Clay, forbad Her meek Intent, she fetch'd a modest sigh: To which the Stranger this mild Answer made: I see thy Mind in thy ingenuous Eye; Thy Courtesy by thy Desire is done, And sweetly calls my ern'd Requital on. 274 This said; she hugg'd her with a dear Embrace, Which clasp'd her straiter than her Gyves and Chains, And deeper printed was than her Disease; For mightily it pierc'd through all her Pains Into her Heart, and girt it up so close, That now no Anguish there could interpose. 275 As He who is some wager'd Race to run, Having his Loins knit up, and being by His Girdle tyed to Himself alone, With nimbler stoutness to the Goal doth fly, Than when his Waste he loose about him ware And there for wearyness had room to spare. 276 Embraced Psyche thus perceiv'd her Breast Lac'd strait, and shrunk into Collection's strength. At first she wonder'd her importunate Guest So much should press her Courtesy; but at length Finding fresh Vigor glowing in her heart, She knew she only squeased out her smart. 277 This threw her down in humble Gratitude To court and kiss her heav'nly Surgeon's foot; A Surgeon whose mysterious Art subdu'd Her strong Disease, and yet subdu'd it not: For though at perfect Ease, yet still as sore She found her boyling Body as before. 278 And now such Courage in her Bosom reigns, That she rejoic'd she had so hard a Race: Her gauntlet she dares give to any Pains, And dreads no lingring Death's most tedious face. Her Chains to her no more than Bracelets are, Her flaming Boyls as Pearls indeed apear. 279 Her Parents' Case to Heav'n's yet hidden Will She freely now resigns; that Will, which though It bitter seem to Worldly Tastes, can still To meek and uncorrupted Palats flow With all the Soul of Sweetness, and will make From Springs of Gall a Flood of Honey break. 280 She seeming yet not to have fully shar'd In Pangs and Suff'rings, feareth not to Pray That He who had on her such strength confer'd Would still more Load upon her shoulders lay: More fewel still unto her Fervor give, Who now by nothing but by Pains could live. 281 Nor was it wonder; for the Stranger here (Thenceforth a stranger unto her no more,) Was sped from Heav'n a special Messenger To heal her Heart now 'ginning to be sore, In her pain'd Body. Willingly she came And did her work, for Patience was her Name. 282 The Eyes of Lambs ne'r darted meeker Raies Than stream from Hers; and yet the Lyon's face With stouter Bravery could never raise His royal Looks, nor with more Courage gaze Upon and challenge Terrors, than do's she, Though soft as Honey, or as Oil she be. 283 All over She is nothing else but Scars, Writ large and fair, to testify what she Had undergone in Heav'n's adventurous Wars; And yet these Characters her Beauty be; For with such silver Light they smile, that they Her noble Limbs like Tires of Stars array. 284 But having thus dispatch'd her Bus'ness, she The cheer'd resolved Pris'ner leav's: when lo The Judge's Messenger arriv'd, to see If Psyche yet were fully tam'd or no: And standing at the Dungeon's mouth, he cries, Learn wretched Maid, at length, learn to be wise. 285 The Judge, on whose sole Will thy Fate depends, In spight of thy Perversness Tender is; And Me on Mercie's Errand hither sends To offer to thee at an easy price Thy Life and Liberty; and more than that If thou thy Irreligion wilt forget. 286 His noble Word (is any Bond or Seal So sure?) he gives, to change thy Poverty Into a wealthy state; nor shalt thou feel What Scorns and Chains, and Dungeons signify; But living in soft Peace and Plenty His High Favor, and the World's Esteem possess. 287 His only Son, the Heir of his Estate, And present Owner of his Heart, for Thee He doth design, except thou shutt'st the gate Against thy entering Felicity; And desperately foolish, wilt desire Before thy Nuptial Torch, thy Funeral Fire. 288 But if you obstinately yet deny To offer Incense to our mighty Jove; You dam the way to all his Clemency, And a deserved Sacrifice must prove To your own Madness: this Decree is past; You must Vranius's Fate to morrow taste. 289 As when the tossed Mariner descries The Promontory of his native Soil, Within whose craggy Horns his harbor lies, He strait forgets his long tempestuous Toil, Beginning his revived Heart to find Swell'd more with Joy than are his Sails with wind. 290 So Psyche hearing that her Doom was past Which to her long-wisht Port would her convey; Her Arms in triumph up to Heav'n she cast With thanks and praises for that happy Day; And in Defiance of his offer'd Grace, Threw this stout answer at the Serjeant's face: 291 My Thanks to your kind Master carry back; High is his Favor, and I it embrace: But sure your Errand you did much mistake, Or willingly at least your words misplace. Death, Death, not Life, a Favor is, and I More gratefully accept That Courtesy. 292 Tell Him he woo's me for his Son too late Who long since was betroth'd, and mean to be True to my noble Spouse: nor can your Threat E'r shake the groundsel of my Constancy, Who doubt not but my Nuptial Tapers will Be lighted at my funeral flaming Pile. 293 As for your vain and wretched Jupiter, Were he but half so true a thing as you, I then would some respect to Him defer; But unto Nothing, what can I allow But what it is? and though your Incense be But smoke, 'tis more substantial far than He. 294 Deceive your foolish Selves no longer, I Am not Enchanted, but All you are so: What else should make you dream I fear to dy, Who through Death's gate to Life's bright Court shall go? Away, and pray your Master, if he be An honest Man, to keep his word with Me. 295 This Answer (which the Bearer fully did,) Inrag'd the Judge to make his Threatnings good. But all in vain his Wrath he marshalled; Heav'n's mild, against his bloody Purpose stood; Nor could fierce Satan further help him, or One step beyond his sturdy Tether stir. 296 Mean while such Joy in Psyche's bosom glow'd Through Expectation of the Fire and Stake, That all her Pains and Torments to it bow'd: For in sweet Quiet she that evening brake Her tedious Vigils, and permitted Sleep Over the Curtains of her Eyes to creep. 297 But Phylax, who in Absence's sad night Had all this while been set; now gained leave Of Heav'n to Rise in his dear Pupil's sight, And from the Tyrant's fury her reprieve: Down to the Dungeon he as gladly flies, As ever he had towred to the skies. 298 Where finding her not only Pris'ner to Her iron Chains, but Sleep's soft silken Bands, He wisely set himself his work to do Whilst She was yet at Rest: His potent Hands Upon her burning Soars he gently laid; Which quench'd, and fled, as of his Touch afraid. 299 Her scurfy Roughcast scaled off, and all Her Skin to fresh and tender smoothness left. So when of old the Syrian General In Jordan had exchang'd his leprous shift, His Flesh appear'd as soft and pure as were The Virgin Streams which smil'd and sported there. 300 With like facility He did but touch The massy Chains which on his Daring lay: Nor durst their brasen Locks so much as grutch That mystick Key's Commandment to obey: But down they tumbled, clashing as they fell; Which Noise to Psyche did their Ruine tell. 301 Up started she, and sought to understand The Noise's meaning, hoping 't had been Day; And that the challeng'd Judge had sent Command Strait to the Stake to hurry her away; That hungry he might other charges save And her for Breakfast ready rosted have. 302 When lo, her self in Phylax's Arms she found Chain'd by the Bands of Love: her other Gyves Confuted all and shattered on the ground She wondring sees; and instantly perceiv's Her Sores were fled she knew not whither: which Scru'd her Amazement to an higher pitch. 303 But then, My Dear, said Phylax, we have now No time to loyter here, but must be gone. Three times she shak'd her head and rubb'd her brow, But off she could not rub the Vision: She yielded therefore to attend the Dream, For no such Truth to her it self could seem. 304 Up from the Dungeon the Angel flew Proud of the Prize which in his Arms he bore; The Bolts and Locks ran from his radiant View, So did the Prison's seav'nfold brasen Door, Yet durst not make the least Complaint, or bear Tales, by their clashing, to the Jaylor's ear. 305 Thus through the Town unseen, unheard he past Leading his Pupil in a silent Way: Great was his Care of her, and great his Haste Till he had brought her into Safetie's Bay; This was a Place which in the Desert He For her immured had with Privacy. 306 A Place sequester'd far beyond the Scent Of any Bloodhound whether Man or Beast; A Place well-furnished with sweet Content And all Conveniences ready drest: Where, having brought her in, No more mistake Thy Bliss, he cry'd, but know thou art Awake. 307 For amply pleas'd with this Experiment, Thy Spouse accepts thy faithful Patience: To snatch Thee from thy Chains and Sores, He sent Me hither, and from all that Violence The furious Tyrant hath prepar'd to day Upon thine undeserving Life to lay. 308 Psyche appal'd at this unlook'd-for Word, And well-perceiving that she heard and saw, With such indignant Discontent was stirr'd Against her Guardian, that had not the Law Of Modesty been printed on her Tongue, Full in his face Defiance she had flung. 309 Sadly she frown'd, and sadlier smote her breast; And looked round about, some hopes to meet That still she was not totally releast Out of the reach of Persecution's Threat: But nothing answer'd her examining Eye, But, what she most abhor'd, Safe Privacy. 310 Wherefore at length she ventur'd thus to ease Her belking Heart: O Phylax, how art Thou, Known hitherto to me by Courtesies, Into mine Enemy transformed now! A greater Tyrant why art Thou to Me Than He from whom thou hast set me free. 311 I by His help, this morning should have seen That Day which riseth from my Spouse's Eyes; Nor had I any longer troubled been Upward to gaze when I would read the skies: O no! Vranius now looks down, when he The region of the Sun and Stars would see. 312 What is this Life of Banishment to Me, Who have no setled Home but That above? What boots it, that my Chains and Malady Are shaken off, if Psyche still must grove A Pris'ner to this heavy Flesh, which more Tormenteth me than any Chain or Sore. 313 And are the Palms and ever-radiant Crown Of Martyrdom so poor and vile a prize; Are Heav'n, and Bliss, and Jesus's presence, grown Things so indifferent, that my longing Eyes Should spare their Tears, when I am snatch'd away From them, and forc'd on sordid Earth to stay? 314 O Phylax, thou hast not reprieved me From any of my pangs: I'm at the stake, I burn, I burn; nor can my Agony But by my final Dissolution slake. She fainted here—But Phylax snatch'd her up, And hasted thus her sorrow's Tide to stop: 315 Courage, sweet soul; and he assured, I Have not deceiv'd thee of thy noble Aim: Thy Spouse design's a Martyrdom whereby To fetch thee to Himself, but not the same He de[s]igned to Vranius: no; for Thee He treasur'd hath a braver Destiny. 316 A Destiny which He on none bestows But those who highest in his Favor set; A Destiny to which thy highest Vows Ne'r yet aspir'd; a Destiny so fit For brightest Seraphs, that were mortal Fate To end their Life, they'd choose no Death but that. 317 More long, more strong, and stretch'd with fuller Pain Thy Martyrdom shall be, than from the Spight Of this, th[r]ough raging Tyrant thou canst gain: Thy Strength's reserv'd for a hardier Fight Than that Vranius fought; and this shall be The Scene of thy heroick Chevalry. 318 Here, here shalt Thou impregnably maintain The sturdy Combat, whilst thy Spouse, and all His Angels waiting on his royal Train, Will be Spectators: Do not then forestal Thy greater Fame by hasty Zeal, but stay With patience for thy Coronation Day. 319 This welcome Answer such Refreshment blew On Psyche's heart, that meek and pliant she Cool'd her importunate Desires, and grew Content to wait the full Maturity Of her affected Laurel: though as yet She little knew how she must Gather it. CANTO XXIII. The Dereliction. The ARGUMENT. Psyche abandon'd to the Solitude Of Soul and Body, by the resolute Might Of patient loyal Constancy subdu'd Hell's Champion Despair in single fight. Yet in her Conquest no free triumph found, Being still a Slave to Dereliction bound. 1 Though cold grim Sadness frowneth in thine Eye, Dear Solitude, yet in thy silent Breast Some worthy Sweetness doth inshrined ly; Witness that Vileness, and that high Request By which betwixt the lazy earthly heart And Pious Soul thou so divided art. 2 He whom black Conscience catching all alone, Suffers not to be so; but in his face Musters in dread array each Legion Of his hell-lifted Sins; and in that Glass Of self-affrighting Terror makes him see What cause he has ev'n his own Foe to be: 3 He, foolish He, a large Inditement draws Against thy larger Innocence; upon Thy Credit's fairest Top his Anger throws Scorn's foulest Bottom: Thee he calls, and none But Thee, the Mother of vexatious Folly, Of Horrors, and despairing Melancholy. 4 He no where but among his roaring Boys Can meet a Quire whose Musick suits his ears, Whilst in the tumult of that boistrous Noise All Atheisme's ranting Wit he hears, And learns what Phrases of mad Vanity, What Oaths, what Blasphemies in fashion be. 5 In this loud Tempest (joined with a Sea Of lusty Wine) he desperately drowns The wholsom Thoughts of sad Sobriety: In this gay Throng, made up of all the Town's Gentilest Crimes, He's certain not to find Free Room to take a View of his own Mind. 6 And thus, unhappy Man, he only lives In his Outside, and therefore liveth not: But when sure Death his woful Summons gives, Alarm'd into a Fright past knowing what To do or think, in vain for help he cries, And to himself a wretched Stranger dies. 7 He dies, and leaves his Body, which could not Endure to be a little while alone, In Grave's dark tedious Solitude to rot; Whilst in the Tumult of Damnation His now uncloyster'd Soul is forc'd to dwell Amongst the Roarers of eternal Hell. 8 But He who dares his Bosom ransack, and Take due survey of every thing within, That he may always ready have at hand An Inventory of Himself, and win Time upon Death by prudent Preparation To entertain and kiss his Consummation; 9 He who can venture to endure the Slander Of Stoicism, and scorn the wanton Lure Of gaudy Fashion, Sin's most faithful Pander; He who can think it reason to Immure Himself, when They who ly at open Ease Prove Prizes to Soul-plundering Miseries; 10 He who will rather sail alone; than run With that wild Navy which no Compass keeps, Nor steers by any heav'nly Light, but on Fleet Shelves doth ride, or rush through rocky Deeps; He whom no cheating Charms can win to be Content to perish for mere Company: 11 He who both Leisure and Desire can find To sequester Impertinences, that His proper Bus'ness he may only mind And raise by pious Thrift his best Estate, That he a Bank of endless Wealth may have When poor he go's and naked to his grave: 12 He, He's the Man, on whom the Citie's Joys And proud Excess; the Countrie's hearty Sport; The gallant Licence, and the glittering Toys, With all the glorious Nothings of the Court, As on their Conqueror look; Since sober He Can of plain Solitude inamored be. 13 For here his Soul more Company can meet And of more high and worthy Quality, Than in the Theater's most thronging Sweat, Where Spectacles profess to court the Eye. Such Preasses justle out all Heav'n, but He Reads it at large in this Vacuity. 14 An undisturbed View he here can take Of all its fairest and its loftiest Stories: His Contemplation here can freely break Through all its Treasures of unbounded Glories; And in the Court where Bliss and Pleasures reign With Saints and Angels brave Acquaintance gain. 15 Here to the Universe's King may He His free attendance pay from Morn to Night, Whilst in the everlasting One and Three He learneth to Divide and to Unite His mystick Homage, as the Spirit's Gale Makes him in this Abyss of Wonders sail. 16 Here constantly he stands upon his Watch, That when the roaring Lyon, whose fierce Chase Surrounds the World his careless Preys to catch, Hunteth that way, his heav'n-imbraved Face May with inured ready-waking Might Confront his Fo, and entertain the Fight. 17 Here, from the sapless World's inchanting breast Where only mocking Froth and Bubbles spring, Himself he weans; and studies how to feast Upon some masculine substantial Thing, Which may not cheat him with short false Content, But yield his Soul eternal Nutriment. 18 No Humor of the Times, no Garbs or Fashions, Can here seduce his Care; no boistrous News Of publick Woes, or fatal Alterations, His Harbour's Halcyon Quiet can abuse. No storms can rage but in the open Seas; His private Bay the Cloyster is of Ease. 19 His righteous Soul is not afflicted here To see and hear how wretched Worms defy Omnipotence's Self, and scorn to fear The Jaws of Hell, to which their Villany Makes them apparent Heirs; but take delight The Love and Blood of Jesus to despight. 20 He sees no Levellers begin their Trade With Altars first, and then with Crowns; he sees No Temples Dens of Holy Robbers made, And garrison'd with strong Impieties; Temples, where under foot the Church is trod, And only Horses serv'd in stead of God. 21 He heareth no Rebellion's Canons first Giving their dire Reports in Pulpits, and As loud, as if indeed their Thunder burst From Heav'n's Artillery; till th'imbroiled Land Too late perceiveth this Vociferation Is but the funeral Sermon to the Nation. 22 Here past the reach of those bewitching Darts Which flash with radiant Bane from Wanton Eyes, And grave both Timorous and Martial Hearts With Mortal, though fanastick Wounds, He lies Secure and safe, and undisturbed may Prepare for his eternal Nuptial Day. 23 Here Time and Freedom he enjoys, to weed And cultivate himself: with pious toil Each Herb of Grace he plants, and sows the Seed Of every Virtue in his Bosom's Soil; Assur'd this Agriculture will conclude I'th' Harvest of mature Beatitude. 24 With prudent Fore-cast he can here provide An ample Stock in readiness to be Against all Charges which may him betide In managing a Publick Life, if he Be called from his private Nest, and made Against the thronging stream of sin to wade. 25 More furnished with strength of Argument From learned Athens never Student came, Who had his nimblest Years and Spirits spent The Engins of deep-reaching Wit to frame; Than doth this sagely-sprightful Champion from His private School of publick Virtue come. 26 For having learn'd their due Contempt to throw Upon those Interests and Baits which make The bias'd Hearts of Men unmanly grow, And cowardly Sin's sneaking Bypaths take; In spight of all the World which dares say No, He in the King of Heav'n's Highway will go: 27 And that is Truth's and holy Wisdom's Road; In which whoever travels, always wins The Games he hunts; for whilst he is abroad, He finds Success and Victory his Inns: And when he to his heav'nly Home ascends, His Journey he in endless Triumphs ends. 28 The Garland thus of all Advantages Retirement's Life is privileg'd to wear: Which therefore only dear and precious is To Them who Sons of heav'n and Prudence are; And which insiped timorous Souls, as they Cannot believe, so never can enjoy. 29 Psyche, who now conducted was into This Solitude, though Zeal's most venturous heat Spurr'd her in stout Uranius's steps to go; Yet, since her Phylax stop'd her forward feet, Appeas'd the Flames of her Impatience by The streaming Comforts of her Privacy. 30 If in the Tumult of the World she still Had mingled been, the Croud had surely slain her; For all Earth's friendliest Furniture and Skill Could with no savory Solace entertain her: Her heart already dwelt in Heav'n, and she Liv'd best where least she could behind it be. 31 And that was here, where by no secular Care Or Interruption's Clog she hamper'd was; But harbouring in a calmy Hemisphere, Upon free Meditation's wings could pass Above the Moon and Sun, and Troops of fair Stars, which in Heav'n's Campagnia ranged are. 32 Yet Contemplation's too jejune and dry To satisfy Love's mighty Hunger: Love Will venture in rebellious Loyalty To reach at full Fruition, though above Her reach it lie: Love's quickned when repell'd, And may Forbidden be, but not With-held. 33 But as her Soul began to pant again For that dear Day of final Conflict she By Phylax's Promise hoped to obtain, And that alone: Lo on the suddain he Warn'd thence by secret Bus'ness from his King, Presently took his leave, and took his wing. 34 As she made haste to ask the reason, he With sprightful speed outflew her Voice, and Eye. A Sigh then strove to follow him; but she Repulsed it with noble Constancy; And cry'd, It must not, and it shall not grieve me: Did Heav'n not call him, Phylax would not leave me 35 Then down upon her yielding Knees she fell, And casting upward her most loyal Eyes, Since thou no less on Earth below dost dwell Sweet Lord, said she, than in the highest skies; Though Phylax's wings now shelter not my head Yet Thine are always o'r thy Handmaid spread. 36 Though to my soul his Company be dear, Yet not so precious as thy blessed Will: Though he has left his feeble Psyche here, I can, and dare be more Abandon'd still, If mighty Thou, who never wilt forsake me, With nearer Losses pleased art to rack me. 37 Fain would I quit the Debt in which to Thee, And mine own Vows I stand; fain would I prove By combating with any Misery, The valiant Truth of my obliged Love. Thou bidst us Follow with our Cross, and lo I in thy bloodiest steps desire to go. 38 I would not to a Figure's Courtesy Beholden be in my Affliction, nor To such a tender Cross condemned be As needs th'assistance of a Metaphor To make its hard Name good; for That, I'm sure Was true and real which Thou didst endure. 39 No golden Plenty Psyche craves of Thee, No soft Content, or silken Peace; impart Those Favors unto whom thou wilt, for me; Thy sharpest Blessings best will sute my Heart: My Heart, which burneth in profound Desire Of some heroick and consuming Fire. 40 If ever Martyr ow'd thee more than I, Permit me not to pay my Blood to Thee. But mighty King of Equity, O Why Must Psyche only not have leave to be What Duty bids her? why must Life be mine, Which is not so, till I have made it Thine? 41 O slay me not by still Denying Death! To suffer want of Suff'rings, is to Me The only Dregs which from thy deepest Wrath Vengeance can squeaze; from this one misery, Which is the Pith of all, I beg reprieve: I die in Torment if in Ease I live. 42 I die; and which is worse than Death and Hell, Die not for Thee, though Thou for me wert slain: Pity, O Pity, Jesu.—Here her Zeal Outflew her Tongue: yet though she could Complain By Words no longer; by her weeping Eyes She poured out as strong a Flood of Cries. 43 Jesus, whose Ear to Love's sweet Dialect Stands always ope, strait heard her Agony; Whose potent Musicke charm'd him to respect Her meekly-venturous Importunity: His sweetned Bitterness apace he sent, And bless'd her with her begged Punishment. 44 Charis, accustom'd open house to keep In her free heart, he there shut up so close That now no glimmering Ray had power to Peep Forth from that Nest of Light: nor could she choose But be suspitious that the spring was dry'd, From whence she saw no Emanations glide. 45 When lo the Welkin, which before was clear, And flowed with the Sun's transparent Gold; Started from its fair Looks with sudden fear, And did in swarthy Weeds it self infold. Day was abash'd to see how boldly Night Incroach'd upon her, and despis'd her Light: 46 The Air, presaging what outrageous Pains Would tear her tender weatherbeaten sides, Looks sadly, and with hollow Groans complains Aforehand of the Storm; which as she chides, She but awakes; and so provokes to rage With louder fury on this tragick Stage. 47 Forthwith the Clouds came tumbling one upon Another's back, for fear to loose their place And office in that blind Confusion With which the Element all gravid was: Close quaking in his Cave lay every Beast, And every Bird lamenting in his Nest. 48 The daunted Trees shiver'd in every Leaf; The stones forgot their strength, and sweat for fear; The Corn hung down their heads, and pour'd their grief By whispers into one another's ear. Never did more dismaying Expectation Usher in any Tempest's Indignation. 49 Strange Phantoms dress'd in spurious smoaking Light Fed by foul Sulphur, flashed all about; Fell grizly Ghosts array'd in gloomy Fright Both with themselves and one another fought: Whole Troops of Feinds and Furies, in despair, Threw their torn Serpents through the sable Air. 50 The labouring Clouds at length with open Cry Brought forth their Woe, and thunder'd their Complaint: The Bowels of the hardest Rocks were by Compassion mov'd; the massy Earth grew faint, And all her boldest Mountains shak'd to hear The doleful Outcry of her neighbour Sphere. 51 Psyche alone as yet refus'd to melt By any Tremor; only in her heart A leaden Numness creeping on she felt, Since Charis there forbore her sprightful Part: When blacker than the rest one heavy Cloud Down to the ground before her face did crou'd. 52 Where having op'd its hideous Curtains wide, Forth at the gap a stream of Lightning broke; The suddenness of whose most dazeling Tide The resolute Maid with some amazement stroke: But strait an Hand reach'd out it self and held A deep wide Cup with greater Terrors fill'd. 53 It held it to her Lip, and that which had Till now been Thunder, prov'd a fiercer Voice, Commanding Her to drink that liquid Dread In proper Answer to her venturous Choise: She nothing more than Pleasures feard; and here Was nothing less than what her heart did fear. 54 Thus challeng'd by the Voice, whose Fount she knew And durst not disobey; into the Cup She sent her Eye to take a plenal view Of this sad Deep before she drunk it up. But there such boiling Horrors she descried, That down she prostrate fell, and thus she cried: 55 Weak Woman, as I was; how has my Pride, My silly Pride, betrayed me to Wo! On Confidence's wings I needs would ride, And pertly towre up to mine overthrow. Had I remembred that a Worm I am, I ne'r had crawl'd so high to reach my Shame. 56 I ne'r had woo'd all Tryals to assail me, I ne'r had challeng'd what I quake to see: But since my prudent Meekness then did fail me 'Tis just my Courage now should languid be. Alas my blindly-valiant Wish is too, Too fully come; and I, what shall I do? 57 To its dead bottom Jesu didst not Thou Grief's mighty Cup for all thy Members drink? How is it then, that this of mine is now Of Poison's rankest Soul a swelling sink: Whose Sorrows, though to Thine they shallow be, Yet are too deep for faint unhappy Me. 58 Thy naked Anger floating here I see, In which no Glimpse of Favor mixed is: What will become of weak abandon'd me Who in thy Count'nance read mine only bliss, If I be drowned in this Sea of Night And buried from thy all-enlivening Sight? 59 Sweet was the Bowle of which Vranius drunk; For being swallow'd up in streams of Fire, Fortunate Saint to Heav'n he only sunk: But I in this black Gulf of hideous Ire Must downward dive, and overwhelmed be In Dereliction's vast Profoundity. 60 I would not fear the most appalling Face Of any Sorrow, which did not forbid The sight of Thine: but now thine Eyes, alas, In strange Aversion's angry Cloud are hid; How shall I steer through this vast Deep, who may Not see the Stars which are to guide my way! 61 Here having knock'd her breast, and turn'd her Eye, Her generous Eye, three times into the Cup; She chid her Sadness with a sadder Sigh, And looking then with noble fervor up; Yet why should I demur, she cry'd, since mine Own Will long since is not mine own, but Thine? 62 If any Title to my Self I had, I might be tender of my Ease and Rest: But since to Thee a Deed of Gift I made (O no! of bounden Pay) Thou art possest Intirely of me; nor must I refuse That Thou what is thine Own shouldst freely use. 63 I am no further I, than Thou wilt grant; Propriety is no such thing to Me: Yet I who nothing have, can nothing want So long as I resigned am to Thee: Thy Will in Sweetness always equal is, Though our false Palates sometimes judge amiss. 64 And now I know thy Will is mingled here In this most dismal Draught, whatever be The present Rellish, Psyche doth not fear But it will end in purest Suavity. I fear it not: and here She snatch'd the Cup, And bravely to the bottom drunk it up. 65 Thus have I seen a real-hearted Friend (Though startled at some hard Experiment Required by his dearer Self,) ascend Above his Fears, and loyally consent To what he hates, his Friendship so to prove Ev'n by the Desperation of his Love. 66 But He who has in poison quaffed deep, And drown'd himself in what he swallow'd down; Quickly perceives the groping Mischief creep About his heart: where being Victor grown, Its fatal Chains of cold and heavy Lead Are soon upon its fainting pris'ner spread: 67 So Psyche having poured down this black Potion of living Death, strait felt its force A Battery against all Comforts make, Which prov'd too weak to stop its Triumph's course; For through her Soul the Deluge broke, and there Maintain'd its cruel uncontroll'd carreer. 68 Forthwith the Clouds, which had beset the Air, Broke up their gloomy Siege; the Phantoms fled; Serenity made all the Welkin fair; The Rocks left quaking: Birds began to spred Their cheerly Wings abroad; Beasts ventur'd forth; So did the Sun, and rendred Heav'n to Earth. 69 The World to every Thing grew fresh and clear, But unto Psyche; for distressed she Perceiv'd no Change whose Courtesy could cheer The turbid Region of her Agony: The Brightness of the Day, to her was more Black than the Vail of Pitch she saw before. 70 Thus cheerly Musick sounds but Torment to A pained Ear: thus Neighbor's Liberty With stricter Fetters gripes the Pris'ner's Wo: Thus Lamps are to the Blind but Mockery: Thus Gales, though cool and gentle, only learn The boiling Flames more furiously to burn. 71 Alas her outward Self long since had she Forgot, and knew not what Earth's Pleasures meant; Above the Sphere of Sensibility She had established her sole Content. What is't to Her, that Phebus shineth fair, Whose Comforts higher than His Zenith were? 72 That little glaring Thing, that mortal Sun, Was not the King and Father of her Day: Her Morning dawn'd with Jesus's Eyes alone, The glorious Fountains of her gallant Joy: And how, how can she live, now she no more Can drink her draughts of Life as heretofore? 73 How can the ravish'd Lover's Comforts breath When from his most inestimably Precious His Eyes exiled are? Death, dolefull Death Meets him in all his Life; and what delicious Objects salute his Sight, but make him read How much more sweet a Gem from him is hid. 74 Her Soul look'd up, alas, but look'd in vain; For on her Eylids sate a Night so thick As damp'd all Prospect, and made Hope complain Which never until now receiv'd a Check. Small is the Blind Man's Grief, to theirs who see Nothing at all but their own Misery. 75 For unto this, and this alone, her Eyes Wide open were, yea though she shut them close: Still her importunate Calamities And Desolations, their black Troops expose In full array to Psyche's view, in spight Of any Vail which could forbid the sight. 76 Tortur'd by this unsufferable Loss, (For she Alone, till now, had never been,) She spread to Heav'n her woful Hands across, And sinking on her Knee to Earth; she in A most abashed deplorable guise Thus to her Spouse's wonted Favor flies. 77 My God, where e'r thou art, Why, why wilt Thou Who every where canst Thy great Self display, To Thy poor Handmaid not one glimpse allow Who once enjoy'd Thy Grace's Highnoon Day? Which had I never done, my present Pain With such excess of Anguish would not reign. 78 Hath not Thy boundless Sweetness taught my heart Complete Disrellish of all things beside? Where grows the Balsam then which for this smart Of mine can any Lenitive provide; So long as most abandon'd I in this Black Death, the Life of thy sweet Aspect miss? 79 Strong was this Cry; for all the Heav'ns it rent, Yet prov'd too weak to make them hear: and she Remembring not she e'r had thither sent Such Prayers in vain, amazed was to see These which so loud about her Spouse resounded, Back to her breast with Emptiness rebounded. 80 Yet as the noble Palm, though on her head A sturdy Burden's stern oppression lies, In valiant Patience still go's on to spread Her indefatigable Arms, and tries How she may both her sad Afflictions bear, And her ambitious boughs still higher rear: 81 So gallant Psyche, though upon her Back Grief's Load more ponderous than Mountains lay; Heroickly resolv'd it should not crack, Nor Her most loyal Tollerance betray: She knew what Jesus underwent before, And that His Love deserv'd thus much and more. 82 She knew she could not Fall, except she would, Although she saw not how she still could stand: No Comfort's Ray she spy'd whereon to hold, Yet fast ev'n on blind Hope she held her Hand; Not doubting but through this most heavy blood Fair Titan's cheerly Face at length would croud. 83 Confirmed therefore, to her Task she went, And spurr'd up Logos to his daily Part; Whom she in Contemplation's Chariot sent To fetch some Solace for her pined Heart: To Joy's celestial Board she sent him, where He us'd to meet with high and holy Cheer. 84 But every Night when He returned home He nothing brought but cold and sapless Fare, Lank dry Results, whose Bulk and Total Sum She never saw amount to more than bare And flashy Vselessness, which mock'd her Hunger And only made her wofull Weakness stronger. 85 This sad miscarriage could not but awake The languid Fountains of her heavy Eyes; Which with continual showers strove to slake, Or empty out her flaming miseries: Yet all the Brine, alas, she thus could pour, But scalt her cheeks and galled her the more. 86 In all Attempts thus thwarted still, though she Too reasonable a Temptation had No more to flout her own Calamity With fruitless Toil: yet she this Statute made To her stout Self, Her Duty still to do Whither Heav'n would regard her Pains or no. 87 So when the unrelenting Storm hath driven The Marriner into the boiling main, Vailing with sullen Clouds the face of Heav'n That from no star he may Direction gain; Though lost, he yields not to his Loss, but plies His trusty Oars, whither he lives or dies. 88 Her Tears she poured still, her Sighs she blew, Her hands she lifted up, her Knees she bent, She knock'd her breast, her Contemplations flew Their wonted flight, her Groans her bosom rent, Her Heart dissolv'd in Languishments of Love, By Watchings, Prayers, and Fasts with God she strove. 89 With God she strove, and with her Self; for all This while her Soul was out of taste, and those Dear Exercises savour'd now of Gall Whose Sweets before all Honey's Powers did pose. Yet she this tedious Gall would not refuse, Nor in exchange accept of Hybla's Dews. 90 Thus when foul Humors have usurp'd and reign In his weak stomach, still his wholesom meat The hungry Man ingesteth, still in vain He feeds what hateth to be fed, and eats But an Assurance that his Cates again Must be regorg'd with nauseous tearing Pain. 91 Her heavy Breast, as cold and dead was now Become, as if it ne'r had been the Seat Of holy Fire, and Heav'n: though wonderous low Her Body beaten lay by Penance, yet Her Soul was far more mortify'd and dry, Pining in Desolation's Agony. 92 This scrued her Condition's Anguish high; For still she neither thought she Watch'd nor Pray'd, Nor shed a Tear, nor heaved up a Sigh, Nor managed her Contemplation's Trade, Nor Groan'd, nor Lov'd; because she never felt Her Heart in all these mighty Ardors melt. 93 What man upon the thankless Rocks can plow, Or found his Building on the faithless Sand, Or in the stormy Ocean's furrows sow, Or wash the tawny Æthiopian's Hand; And still be patient, though his Pains and Cost A thousand times already he has lost? 94 Where's that unwearied He, who though employ'd In waiting upon Fire and Flames, and set With sulphury fuel up to keep the Tide Of iron Furnace's enraged Heat, Can be content Frost's Tyranny mean time Should cross his Trade, and nip and shrivel Him? 95 Yet through these Riddles of Disconsolation Brave Psyche waded, and bore up her head Above the Deluge; whilst without all Passion Her Passion she embrac'd, and wearyed Her Self with so much Quiet, as to seem To Row indeed, but only down the stream. 96 For patiently she tired was; but found No Comfort in this Conquest of her Pain: Yet though she every day and hour were drown'd Ev'n whilst she swum, she vowed to maintain The mighty Conflict, and her self to give Up freely in this rueful Death to Live. 97 Long liv'd she in it: and although her Fasts She duely kept, yet would she not forbear, When Nature challeng'd them, such spare Repasts As her might fit to wage this Suff'rings War: Though her Ambition's Aim were, but to Die, She scorn'd to haste by force her Destiny. 98 Long liv'd she in it: for her Spouse was now Resolv'd her Valour's full Extent to trie; And make her Soul most lamentably know The Value of his own reveled Eye By hiding it from hers. No Lesson can Like Loss and Absence, teach unhappy Man. 99 As thus she panting lay; the fretted Prince Of restless Envy, who roves night and day, Prying about the World to gather thence Fresh Booties upon which his Wrath may prey; Discover'd her in this disconsolate plight, And leap'd for cruel Joy to see the sight. 100 But as a Coward, who hath oft been beat, Yet still on base revengeful hope doth feed, Waits opportunity till he may meet His fear'd Antagonist empoverished In Strength and Spirits by some other Fight, And on that Weakness builds his stollen Might: 101 So now basehearted He that shock forbore Till Psyche's Courage he conceived spent: And then with prouder Hopes than e'r before Down to his damned Home puff'd up he went: (Fool as he was, to let his hasty Eye Such Triumph look before the Victory.) 102 Then having climb'd his Throne, and from his face Wip'd off the coalblack sweat, into a smile He forc'd his Cheeks: The feinds admir'd what cause Their King's Austerity could so beguile: Yet in compliance every one begun To shrivel up his chaps and gently grin. 103 When Satan thus: Hate and Defiance first To Heav'n, and then all glory to my Self. You know to what expence of Pains that curst And though most feeble, yet most stubborn Elf Jesus his Mistress, long hath put me, yet On that vile Worm my Will I ne'r could get. 104 But now the feat is done, and wretched she Is by her goodly spouse divorc'd, and lies To our just Vengeance's severity A most abandon'd and devoted Prize. I saw her as she lay; but scorn'd to bring Her with me: no; it sutes not with a King. 105 Not with the King of most heroick Pride; Disdain's the highest Jewel in my Crown: I who to Heav'n's big Sovereign deny'd To bend my sturdy knee, must not stoop down To take up vile Dust: though below I dwell In Night, the Rising Morn's my Mother still. 106 But Thou, Dispair, (and here he turn'd aside, For waiting at his right hand stood the feind,) Shalt tear her hither: Thou mayst find her hid In that blind Desert's furthest closest End, Which borders on the Superstitious sink Where Arimathean Joseph's bones do stink. 107 The delegated fury made no stay, (For what so headlong is as Desperation?) But posted upward, snatching by the way Her dismal Engins in such ireful fashion, That all her Sisters started at her haste, And frighted Hell was glad when she was past. 108 I'th dark deep bowels of the hilly Peak There lies a gloomy and disconsolate Way, Through which with such impatient pace she brake, That round about the Country trembling lay; In whose dull bosom all the sleepy Lead; Awak'd for fear, and ran about its bed. 109 The Beasts which saw the Monster as she flew, Distracted at the horror of the sight, Themselves down fatal Precipices threw; All Birds unable to maintain their flight Let their Wings flag, and hung their heads aside, And having chang'd their Songs to shriekings, dy'd. 110 But still the frighted Fury posted on Till she arriv'd at her desired Place: Where finding pensive Psyche all alone, She set her hideous self full in her face. All horrid Wrinkles to her odious Looks Are Gardens of Delight and Beautie's Books. 111 Pale Ghastlyness triumphed in her face. Which yet with fierceness strangely truce maintain'd: Her own Veins swarthy Gore with hellish Grace The grim deep Valleys of her Cheeks ingrain'd; Where her fell Nails to plough full often went, And on her cursed self her madness spent. 112 Her locks were half rent off, so was her Gown; And more by careless Nastyness was she Arrayed than by Clothes: Her breasts hung down All lank and torn, and flapp'd upon her knee, Which gap'd, and shew'd the naked shatter'd bones She wilfully had dash'd on ragged stones. 113 Ten thousand Bruses made her Leanness fat With Tumors and with Pains: no Joints were true To their uniting Name; nor any knot Of Ligaments their binding Office knew: Her carcase was an heap of broken Limbs, By which she only her own Ruins seems. 114 But every part look'd delicate and fair, To her most hollow yet most staring Eyes; In which such sovereign Terrors muster'd were, As fear's own fancy ne'r could equalize; For one was like to nothing but the other, And either strove which should outstare his brother. 115 These were the ominous Mirrours where each He Whose Bosom was not innocent and clear No sooner look'd, but he was forc'd to see His heart in all her Crimes array'd; which there Appearing double, rais'd his fright so high That from his odious self he long'd to fly. 116 The direfull Basilisks' mischievous Eyes, And those of fascinating Witches, are Far safer Glasses, than these Prodigies Which with the Life of killing Horrors glare. Heav'n shield the Man whose miserable Chance Damns him into the compass of her Glance. 117 Nor was the furniture of this foul Hag Improper for her formidable looks: Her starv'd sharp Arms did loads of Weapons lag, Rust-eaten Swords, Knives, Daggers, Bodkins, Hooks, With poison-hugging Boxes; all bound up Here with a fatal Wieth, there with a Rope. 118 Appointed thus; she stood a while and stared On desolate Psyche; who at first was stroke (For unexpectedly the fein'd appeared, And with a sudden Dint,) at her fell look: Yet she disdained to be beaten over, And nobly did her strength and self recover. 119 The Tower thus, which at th'unlook'd-for Blast Of th'angry Storms forlorn doth yield to quake; Forgetteth not withal to stand more fast Than those proud Buildings which refuse to shake, And therefore by an instant Ruin down From their exalted Confidence are thrown. 120 Dispair perceiving that her looks were vain, Her far more dangerous Engin mov'd, (for this Was her bewitching Tongue, now taught to strain Up to the highest Key of Craftiness; And casting down her Luggage, thus assay'd To do as much upon the constant Maid. 121 If I thy doubtful Count'nance read aright, Thy gloomy Wo perceives not who am I Nor who thy Self: But this thy desolate plight Charms my convinced Pity to descry Both unto Thee; that if thou wilt befriend Thy self, no Enemies may Thee offend. 122 I know my Aspect speaketh nothing less Than Courtesy: but Things which fairest smile, Too frequently in their inchanting Dress The lurking stings of odious Treason vail: And sober Wisdom always must commend Before a fauning Fo, a frowning friend. 123 Were it not so; thy self hadst never strove Against the flattering Tide of Things below; Distrustful always of the soothing Love With which the World's inviting Courtships flow: Were it not so; what Price could be so high To hire thee thus thy self to Mortify? 124 And what should I do here in any Dress Of gaudy Sweetness, which strict Thou long since Hast banish'd from thy Love, espousing this Course Life of Solitude, where no pretence Of Beauty peeps? nor canst thou now deny But thine own Choise is my Apology. 125 Suspect not then my Looks, which only show Like Terror's living Theatre to Them Whose vain deluded bosom's overflow With secular Pleasure's frothy empty stream: These think each Gale which to the Haven would blow them Will prove a storm, and into Ruin throw them. 126 But thy Condition, if thou weigh'st it right, Will teach thee better what concerns thy Bliss: Remember then, that since thou saw'st the Light, Thou ne'r hadst reason to be friends with this Vntoward Life, which always to regret thee With restless Swarms of Sorrows hath beset thee. 127 The dainty Buds of thy young vigorous years Served not to trim a Garland for Delight; By rigid Virtue's most untimely Cares They blasted were; and Thou, ev'n in Despight Of blooming-Tenderness preventedst Time, And provedst Old and wither'd in thy Prime. 128 Whilst other Maidens ripe for Nuptial Joy, Gather'd the Sweetest Sweets of cheerly Nature; Thou spentst thy self in solitude's Annoy, Living a Comfortless and single Creature: Yet in thy Virgin Bed thou could'st not 'scape Being a Mother to all sad mishap. 129 For from thine Isle of Bliss, thy native Home, Thy fruitless Zeal exil'd thee to the East; Where Thou through cursed Palestine did'st rome, Both to the Place a Stranger, and to Rest: What found'st thou but thy loss, whilst there thy Soul Drunk, and was drown'd, in Heresy's black Boul? 130 Alas the dear Memorials of thy Lord Which there thy hankering Eyes so often read, Did but Assurance to thy Heart afford That He, its only Joy, to Heav'n was fled: And surely here at home thou wert as near The happy Spheres, as in thine Exile there. 131 Thus having wasted out thy Strength and Time (And Credit too, with those who lov'd thee best,) Thou flutter'dst back to this thy British Clime Like some poor wearyed Bird to her old Nest; Where when thou countedst up thy Journey's Gains, Thou only had'st thy Labour for thy Pains. 132 Then fired by unhappy Piety, Upon thy Self thou did'st the Tyrant play: Thy lamentable Body sheweth by Its ghastly Leanness, how thou strov'st to slay Thy guiltless flesh, and by Devotion's Rack Languid and senseless every Sense to make. 133 And for no other End, but to refine Thy Self from this dull Earth into a state Which might thy backward Spouse's Heart incline To loyal Thee, who with such venturous Heat Did'st trace thy hardiest steps, and cheerly toss On thy soft shoulders his most heavy Cross. 134 Yet when her just Reward thy faith expected, (Less due to thy Uranius, than to thee,) He to an odious Dungeon thee rejected, (A Place how far from Heav'nly Liberty!) Where Thou who in pure flames long'dst to expire, Wert forc'd to lead a dying Life in mire. 135 Remember what intolerable Chains Into thy Soul their cruel Iron prest; What floods of boiling Soars and fiery Pains Were pour'd on thee; what Anguish slew thy Rest: Remember how all foes but He relented, And mighty Cruelty her self repented. 136 He to whose barbarous trust the Management Of Persecution's War was here committed, Fought with his own outrageous Intent, And conquer'd by thy Woes, thy Suffrings pity'd: But from Life's Dungeon when he had prepared To set thee free, thy freedom was debarred. 137 It was debarr'd, and by no other Hand But that which rather should have lent thee aid: And what did Phylax but thy Lord's Command When from Joy's brink he stole thee, and betrayed Thy hopes of Martyrdom, which now was grown Mature, and offer'd to thine head a Crown? 138 I grant, thy torturing soars he healed, but Deserv'd no thanks for such a cruel Cure, Which did but thy repaired Body put Into an abler posture to endure This greater Load; whose merciless Excess Doth my unpityed shoulders now oppress. 139 Shoulders unpityed by Him from whom Thy Service had full dearly earn'd Relief: But in his hardned Ears was left no room To entertain the suit of deepest Grief. Had any there been left, sure He could not Thy mighty Supplications out have shut. 140 How has the stroke of thy impetuous Cry Taught this dumb Desert Sorrow's Dialect; Whilst all its Rocks and Caverns shaken by Thy Groans and Lamentations, them reflect To Heav'n with doubled fervor, and agree Fellow-petitioners to be with Thee! 141 And yet thy grated Throat is not so dry, As are thy now exhausted Eyes; from whence Thy Spouse's sturdy heart to mollify Thou pourd'st thy constant floods: but that immense Relentless stone which barbarizeth His Strange Breast, by all those streams unpeirced is. 142 Unkindly He still turns his face away Least any helpful Glimpse should leap to thee: And thou long flatter'd by his favor's Day, Art now betrayed to the Misery Of blackest Night. O may all Souls be ware How they Heav'n's wiley Sovereign trust too far. 143 He mighty Promises indeed doth give; For Words are cheap and put Him to no cost: But can thy Soul on aëry Diet live, And feed on verbal Nutriment? the most Thou can'st pretend is Hope: and what is that But Sorrow's flattering and endless Cheat? 144 Alas thy desolate Heart too well doth know How little I in thy Condition err: And with secure Presumption Psyche, thou May'st this Conclusion from my Art infer: That I who can discover all thy Grief, May tell what Physick must be thy Relief. 145 Thy Phylax, once esteem'd thy trustiest friend, Well understands the depth of thy Disease: Yet finding all his skill too faint to lend Thee any real Help, himself he frees From fruitless Trouble, and is fled away; Ashamed now his weakness to betray. 146 I know not how; but always at a pinch When great Extremities crave equal Aid, Your vulgar Comforters use still to flinch, And Cry, God's will be done: but I afraid Of nothing am, no not God's Destination; Dispair alone can feel no Desperation. 147 I, I, the only able Doctress, who In desperate Cases certain Physick give; In pity of thy unregarded Wo Am hither come on purpose to relieve Thy helpless Heart: Nor do I ask a fee; My ample guerdon shall thy Safety be. 148 Lo here approv'd Receipts: When noble Saul The field, his Kingdom, and his God had lost; That Rapier he no sooner found, but all The conquering Plot of his mishaps he crost, And malgrè sternPhilistia's Powers, fell Down to the Rest of holy Samuel. 149 Disgrac'd by Hushai, and rejected by Fond Absalom, profound Achitophel For rescue from misfortune's Tyranny Consulted with his own deep Oracle; And found no wiser way than by this Rope His Breath, his Life, and his Contempt to stop. 150 Great Annibal, accustom'd long to ride In Triumph's Chariot, being overborn By undeserv'd Disaster's pow'rful Tide; Scorn'd to become th'insulting Roman's scorn, But sipp'd his safety from that Poison there And went in glorious Peace unto his Beir. 151 Renowned Cato, when by peevish fate Thrust into straits too narrow to contain His mighty Spirit; by soon-ended Hate Of wretched Life, immortal Rest did gain. There lies the Sword, the lucky Sword whereby He op'd his way to generous Liberty. 152 When base false-hearted Fortune had betray'd The gallant Antony to Overthrow; Of nothing but vile fear was he afraid, And much disdaining, though subdu'd, to bow; Cut with that Weapon his unworthy thred Of Life, and laid him down in Honor's Bed. 153 Say not, that These were Men, and female Thou Too weak to manage Masculine Bravery: Thy Sex's stout exploits will not allow That weak Excuse: yet, could I cite to thee No Precedents, thy most Extreme Distress Might be thy warrant for this manlyness. 154 But see that Daggor, smeared with the Blood The manly Blood of female Lucrece; she Not trusting to her Tears' poor womanish flood, Took her courageous Advice from Me; And broach'd red Torrents from her noble Veins To paint with Glory her Pollution's stains. 155 Brave Portia, when her sad Disasters grew So thick and cross that they the way had damm'd To every known Relief, found out a new Road unto Death, and down her throat she cramm'd That Fire which made her Valour's sacrifice: Part of the Coals still in that Vial lies. 156 Though sweetest Antony was wont to rest In Cleopatra's dainty bosom; yet When Losses her besieged, to her breast, Her lovely breast, an odious Aspe she set; Which suck'd out her abhorred Life; and in That Box the Serpent doth himself intwine. 157 Now that a British Hand as much may do As any Foreign, thou hast witness by Thy late Compatriot Boadicia, who Boldly outbrav'd her own Calamity. Lo there's the Poison by whose Virtue she Preserv'd her self from Roman Bondage free. 158 These, and ten thousand more have I befriended With Rescue from deplor'd Extremities: And though I ne'r to any one commended His Choise of these Receipts; thy Miseries Move my Compassion so, that I'm content Thou shouldst have leave to choose thy Instrument. 159 A burning or a freezing Poison take, A Sword, Stiletto, Dart, Spear, Dagger, Knife, Fire, Water, Rope; or whatsoe'r will make An end of thine; no, of thy Torments' life: And if one will not serve, take two or three; Nay I can spare them all poor Heart, for thee. 160 But hate not thou thy self, 'cause I am kind, Nor scorn the Bounty of my Pity: know It stands not with a truly generous mind To fear her own more than another's Blow. If thou wouldst Live indeed, be brave, and Die: The Life of Fame will reach Eternity. 161 Come then; and since thy Spouse so cruell is, Give him his Due, and Curse him to his face: Come choose thy Passage to thy ready Bliss, And nobly send thy Self to that calm Place, Where Heros who durst wretched Life disdain Safe in the Arms of endless Peace remain. 162 Thou hast too long already waited on The leisure of regardless Heav'n; since thou Art able by thy valiant Hand alone To give thy self what that will not allow. A Martyrdom's thy wish; and thou may'st be A Martyr now to thine own Bravery. 163 So spake Dispair. But Psyche all the while Stood firm and constant as the resolute Rock: For well she understood Her fatal Guile, And wisely arm'd her self against the Shock; Which in the Fury's unexpecting face By her stout Answer thus returned was: 164 Take up thy Implements mischievous Elf, And, since thou fail'st in this thy deep Design, Go and employ them on thy cursed self: My state is bad enough; I need not join Thy damned Offer to augment my Grief, And 'cause I'm Sick, dispair of all Relief. 165 Surely it may suffice my Wish, that I Thus miserable am: why should I throw My most dejected self still lower? why Should I whom now no other Friend will know, Turn, in destructive Pity, mine own Fo, And wilfully join Madness to my Wo? 166 What were those Heros whose preposterous Might Thou gild'st so fairly with thine eloquent Lye; But venturous Cowards, who in fear to fight With Pain, Loss, Shame, or Bondage, chose to Die? Far be it I should Valour's Title give To those who durst not do so much as live. 167 'Tis true, my Spouse hath hid his joyous face, And sure I have deserv'd he should do so. Yet ne'r was Night so long, but yielded place At length to cheerly Day; but that which you Howl in Beneath, and therefore wondrous fain Into that endlesse Darkness me would gain. 168 Let Jesus use his Pleasure on me; I His Dust and Ashes am: and so go tell Black Belzebub, your envious Father, by Whose delegation you are come from Hell. Tell him, though Jesus kill me, yet I must And in his Goodness will repose my Trust. 169 The Fury to this Word made no Reply, But by an hideous Shrick; which split the Air And rent the Earth, rebounding on the Sky And heart of Hell at once: all thunders were Faint Murmurs, and the Tempest's bellowing Voice But trembling Whispers to this monstrous Noise. 170 Then snatching up her Baggage, with one Hand, And with the other tearing off her hair, Her skin, her flesh; she cursed Jesus, and To Peak's close road returned bleeding; where She shriek'd again and shak'd all Hell before She entred through the Gulf of th'iron Door. 171 Great Satan started, when the Feind he saw Come thus lamenting home without her Prey: Full on her throat he clapt his brazen Paw, And through it tore his Indignation's way: For Pain She roared, so did He for spight; The dire Deeps trembling at the dreadful sight. 172 But Psyche, though her Victory were great, And might in other Hearts have Triumph bred, No Joy could relish in her glorious Feat; For to all Comfort she was cold and dead, And in her Conquest still remain'd as sad As if her self had been the Captive made. 173 Her hands she wrung, and smote her pensive breast, And cry'd, what is that good success to me? So long as Heaven is deaf to my Request, So long's I grope in this Obscurity, So long as from my Spouse's Eyes the wide Black Curtains of Disfavor mine must hide? 174 What have I gained now my Fo is fled But freer leisure to observe my Sorrows? Indeed the field is mine; but oh! the Seed Of Desolation grows in all its furrows. Let those triumph, to Rest whom Conquest sends; My Victory in Grief begins, and ends. 175 Now, now alas, by dear Experience, I Have learn'd that Sweets and Pleasures no where are Their genuine selves, but in the Treasury Of Jesus's all-enamoring Count'nance: there, O there they shine; but hidden are from me Who ev'n in Joy find nought but Misery. 176 As in the Gulf of this Disconsolation She plunged lay, and saw no way to rise: Her Phylax tir'd with his long Sequestration From his dear Charge, of whose Calamities His tender heart was jealous; never rested Till Leave to see Her he from Heav'n had wrested. 177 And then, no wind its wings e'r stoutlier stretch'd Or flew with cheerlier Velocity: But when his Speed the wished Place had reach'd, Far from his Wish prov'd disappointed He: Down fell his Plumes and Eyes, back flew his Blood, And he O how unlike an Angel stood! 178 Such havock Grief had made in Psyche's Face That in her Self her self he scarce could spy. Besides, the lovely beams of heav'nly Grace, Which us'd to sparkle in her holy Eye Were damp'd with deadish Dulness, and no sign Peep'd forth of any thing within divine. 179 This further spurred on his Search to see What weather 'twas in her high-throbbing Breast: Where finding thick and heavy Darkness, He Would to the Center of her Heart have prest; But Charis there so close lay locked up, That all his sweetness could not charm it ope. 180 At this amazed, and amazed too That She who with impatient Love had used To bid him welcome, and his Feet to woo With humble Kisses, strangely stood amased; As doubtful whether now it were not best To throw Neglect, on her unsent for Guest. 181 And yet resolv'd to try the strength of Love, And not be dash'd out of his kind Intent; He thrice embraced Her, and gently strove Her Sorrows' Fulness to out-compliment: With all his heav'nly Heats he wrought to thaw That Frost, whose Chains about her Soul he saw. 182 But what can tardy Salves and Balsams do If Life has once the Member bid Adieu? In vain do's Phylax hug his Pupil, who Beyond all help of finite Cordials grew. In vain he blew those Ashes, in whose Heap No Embers, nor no hopeful spark did sleep. 183 With full as probable success might Lot Have hugg'd and courted his transformed Wife; Wooing the Pillar to be moved at His Kisses' suit, when her condemned Life Was choaked up in Salt, and she become At once the doleful Carcase and the Tomb. 184 This plough'd his heart with so severe a wound That he forgot with him he brought his Tongue. And pitching sadly down upon the ground, His anxious Thoughts and Eyes on her he hung; Whilst Silence curb'd his daunted Lips, and quite Sealed them up for many a day and night. 185 So when the Desolate Idumæan Prince Not worth so much as his own Skin was left, But by an universal Confluence Of Losses and of Soars, of all bereft; His dearest Friends sate by him in profound And silent Grief's deep stupifaction drown'd. 186 But then perceiving his long Expectation Bred no relenting in her stiff Disease; Into the Dialect of Consolation He forc'd his Breath, and try'd his best by these Most tender Lenitives, to venture on A Combat with her Heart's cold heavy stone. 187 O Psyche, (if thou yet remainest she,) What means this long Aversness in thine Eye? How hast thou lost thy memory of me Who still am Phylax; and Calamity, Me thinks, should make thee not forget that Name, Which tells thy Grief I thy Protector am. 188 If ever thou hadst found me false, when thy Distress had summon'd my helping hand; Or if thy present Load of misery Doth not in need of my Assistance stand; Well mightst thou by this strange Deportment dart Disdain upon the Comforts I impart. 189 It was no Bus'ness of mine own which drew Thy faithful Phylax from thy Company; Witness the time when I so gladly flew To Palestine, and back again, with Thee; Forsaking all that while the sphere where I In sovereign Blessedness was wont to fly. 190 But He who both my Master is and thine Call'd me away; if yet it were away: For this my late Employment less was mine, Than thine, for whose sweet sake thy Spouse did lay That charge upon me: Courage then, my Dear, And to my happy News give cheerly ear. 191 When I in heav'n had long Attendance paid To Jesus's Pleasure, most propitious He Hearing my Sighs, in Gentleness array'd His Looks, and to his Footstool beckned Me? Where having on my Face ador'd him thrice, He blessed me as oft, and bad me rise. 192 Then smiling towards his right Hand, at which His gracious Mother shin'd; who makes the Light Of Heav'n it self with her mild Luster rich; Behold, said he to me, my Dearest Sight; Behold the Queen of all this Joy and Bliss, Which by my Regal Title I possess. 193 But her Retinue's yet not so complete As she deserves, and I must therefore grant: Soft snowy Followers, answering her sweet And ever-virgin Self, she still doth want; And from my Nursery below must I Her worthy Train with fitting Plants supply. 194 And one of those is humble Psyche, she Whose Watering, and whose Pruning is thy Charge: Her from unworthy Dust's Captivity, And her now bitterer Straits, will I enlarge, When I have thoroughly proved her to be By Fire's true Witness, fitting Gold for me. 195 In that bright Station shall her Dwelling be, (To Mary's right hand his he pointed here,) There shall the Clouds of her Humility Break up into a Day of Glory; there Shall all her gloomy Suff'rings shine: and go, And from my Mouth assure thy Pupil so. 196 I prostrate fell, and took my leave; and flew, More on Joy's wings than these, through our vast Sea Of glorious Blessedness: but as I drew Near thine old Friend Vranius, (for he Reigns on a lower Throne than thine,) he cry'd, What Fortune Phylax doth thy Charge betide? 197 That shall you shortly see, said I; and so Posted directly hither unto Thee. And if this News cannot outlook thy Wo, Tell me why thus thou slight'st Felicity; Why Phylax ne'r less welcome seem'd than now He of thine highest Hopes the Dawn doth show: 198 Why thou against the meek ingenuous Law Of Gratitude, refrainest to embrace With joyous heart, and with unfurrowed brow This mighty Token of Heav'n's royal Grace; Why thou thine own Ambition contradictest, Whilst with his Promise thou thy Spouse rejectest. 199 So spake the Angel. But the heavy Maid Grown deaf to every word that sounded Joy; Her hand upon her dolefull Bosom laid, And overpress'd with Mountains of Annoy, Hung down her head; replying by a Flood Of Tears, how little Him she understood. 200 But seeing his Demand unsatisfy'd With that dumb Answer, first an heavy Groan She helped forth; then flinging open wide Her lamentable Arms, Let me alone, She cry'd, and to my domineering Grief Afford at least in Pity this Relief. 201 I know you were of old, and still would be My faithfull Friend; I well remember you Are Phylax, and what blessed Suavity Your constant Love did to my heart allow. But this was when that heart alive you found, Which now in Desolation's Sea is drown'd. 202 What Comfort tastes a Carcase cold and dead In th'ardent Courtesy of Fomentations? In vain are Tables sumptuously spread, With Luxury's own proudest Preparations, To court a Stomach, when her Appetite By Nauseousness is slain to all Delight. 203 Blame me not Phylax, for I love you still, And of your Presence fain the Sweets would reap; But now my greater Joy is damp'd, my Will Reacheth her Arms to this in vain; you heap But Torments on me whilst before my face You rank those Pleasures I cannot embrace. 204 Should I but strive to grasp them, envious They Would shrink to Emptiness, and mock my Hand; Or from their lovely selves quite fly away, Degenerating into Sorrows and Rightdown Vexations, rather than impart One Taste of Joy to Psyche's hated heart. 205 For what, what Rellish can there be to Me In any Dainties Daintiness can cook; So long's the Lord of my Felicity From my devorced Eyes himself doth cloke? If Phebus once withdraws his sovereign Ray, What can poor Candles do to cheer up Day? 206 Wonder not Phylax at my bold Complaint; Psyche in Sorrow's School's more learn'd than Thou: Thy privileged Heart did ne'r acquaint With Desolation's company, nor know What mine now feels: It feels, and no Pretence It findeth to distinguish Loss and Sense. 207 Thy News a potent Cordial would appear If fann'd on any fainting Wight but Me; But I in Heav'n's and Bliss's Name can hear No Melody at all, since Misery Hath seal'd and frozen up my Breast, and I To my dead self alone abandon'd lie. 208 Were I now perch'd upon the Battlement Of highest Glory, and beneath me saw The Seraph's flame; yet I should not resent That Throne as glorious: still, still Below Should I esteem my self, so long as I Am muffled up from seeing my Most High. 209 Did but the wonted Beams of heav'nly Grace Vouchsafe to smile upon my Hemisphere They eas'ly would outdare the sourest face Of all the Sorrows which are frowning there: But since sweet Charis is eclips'd to me Phylax is absent though he Present be. 210 Yet now great Jesus, whose poor Worm I am, Is pleas'd to leave me to my arid Dust; His Pleasure I must not presume to blame, Which though most Bitter, yet is surely Just. His mighty Name I still adore and bless, His heavy Rod which plough's my Soul, I kiss. 211 Here manly Sadness stopt her mouth, and she From Phylax having turn'd her ghastly Eyes, With folded Arms embrac'd her Agony. When He, who could no Antidote devise For Her, turn'd sick himself; and hanging down His pensive head, tun'd by her Groans his own. CANTO XXIV. The Consummation. The ARGUMENT. Restor'd to Grace's Light, and Ravish'd by The splendor of Beatitude, which shin'd In her sleep-closed eyes, Psyche with high Desire's Impatience, feels her fervent Mind Fall all on fire: and thus She nobly dies, As she before had Liv'd, Love's Sacrifice. 1 Sweet END, thou Sea of Satisfaction, which The weary Streams into thy Bosom tak'st; The Springs unto the Spring Thou first dost reach, And by thine inexhausted Kindness mak'st Them fall so deep in love with thee, that through All Rocks and Mountains to thy Arms they flow. 2 Thou art the Center, in whose close Embrace, From all the wild Circumference, each Line Directly runs to find its resting Place, Upon their swiftest Wings, to perch on thine Enobling Breast, which is their only Butt, The Arrows of all high Desires are shot. 3 All Labours pant and languish after Thee, Stretching their longest Arms to catch their Bliss; Which in the Way, how sweet soe'r it be, They never find; and therefore on they press Further and further, till desired Thou, Their only Crown, meet'st their Ambition's brow. 4 With smiles the Plowman to the smiling Spring Returns not Answer, but is jealous till His patient Hopes thy happy Season bring Unto their Ripeness with his Corn, and fill His Barns with plenteous Sheaves, with Joy his Heart; For Thou, and none but Thou, his Harvest art. 5 The no less sweating and industrious Lover Lays not his panting heart to rest upon Kind Looks and gracious Promises, which hover On Love's Outside, and may as soon be gone As easily they came: but strives to see His Hopes and Nuptials ratify'd by Thee. 6 The Traveller suspecteth every Way, Though they thick trac'd and fairly beaten be; Nor is secure but that his Leader may Step into some Mistake as well as He; Or that his strength may fail him; till he win, Possession of Thee his wished Inn. 7 Nobly besmeared with Olimpick Dust, The hardy Runner prosecutes his Race With obstinate Celerity, in trust That Thou wilt wipe and glorify his face: His Prize's Soul art Thou, whose precious sake Makes him those mighty Pains with Pleasure take. 8 The Mariner will trust no Winds, although Upon his Sails they blow fair Flattery; No Tides, which with all fauning Smoothness flow, Can charm his Fears into Security; He Credits none but Thee, who art his Bay, To which through Calms and Storms he hunts his way. 9 And so have I, cheer'd up with Hopes at last To double Thee, endur'd a tedious Sea; Through publick foaming Tempests I have past; Through flattering Calms of private Suavity; Through interrupting Companies' thick Press; And through the Lake of mine own Laziness; 10 Through many Sirens' Charms, which me invited To dance to Ease's Tunes, the Tunes in fashion; Through many cross misgiving Thoughts which frighted My jealous Pen; and through the Conjuration Of ignorant and envious Censures, which Implacably against all Poems itch. 11 But chiefly Those which venture in a Way That yet no Muse's feet have chose to trace; Which trust that Psyche and her Jesus may Adorn a Verse with as becoming Grace As Venus and her Son; that Truth may be A nobler Theme than Lyes and Vanity. 12 Which broach no Aganippe's Streams, but those Where Virgin Souls without a Blush may bathe; Which dare the boistrous Multitude oppose With gentle Numbers; which despise the Wrath Of galled Sin; which think not fit to trace Or Greek or Roman Song with slavish pace. 13 And seeing now I am in ken of Thee, The Harbour which enflamed my Desire, And with this stedy Patience ballas'd Me In my uneven Road; I am on fire, Till into thy Embrace my Self I throw, And on the shore hang up my finish'd Vow. 14 Nor will thy Pleasantness less welcome be To worried Psyche, who so long hath sail'd Through deepest Oceans of Calamity, And over many a boistrous Storm prevail'd; Who through the Smiles, and through the Frowns of heaven With equal Meekness hath till now been driven. 15 For still on Thee She fix'd her longing Eye; On Thee, who only couldst her Soul afford The Plenitude of her Felicity; The dear Enjoyment of her precious Lord; Which made Thee nobly change thy fading Name Of End, and firm Eternity become. 16 As She sate teaching Phylax how to grieve, Who faithfully her Sorrows copyed; The Time approach'd when Heav'n would her reprieve From this sad Duty, and upon her Head Let fall the Crown, which in this tedious Fight She bravely earned by her constant Might. 17 With joyeuse Horror on the sudden she Started and trembled, and leapt from the ground: The Angel wonder'd what the Cause might be Whose quick Effect did upon Him rebound; For up he sprung and in suspense expected What rais'd the Maid so much before dejected. 18 When lo, the Joy thus kindled in her breast Broke forth and flamed in her cheerful Eye: For blessed Charis, who so long supprest Deep in the centre of her Heart did lie, Was now unlock'd by Jesus, and had leave To her sweet Influence the Reins to give. 19 So when thick sullen Clouds have damm'd up Day And dolefull Blackness vail'd the Welkin's face; If Phebus through those Curtains rends his way And chides home Darkness to its proper Place; The Air surprised with her sudden Bliss At first with frightfull Gladness startled is. 20 So when the unexpected virgin Light Broke from the glorious Mouth of God upon The rude disconsolate Heap of first-born Night; That flashing Morn with chearfull Terror ran About the Universal Deep, which was Astonish'd at the Dint of Luster's face. 21 Psyche with Pleasure's strong Incursion seiz'd And shaken thus; before she leisure had To vent her Gladness, was anew surpris'd: For Charis through her breast a passage made, And in th'exuberance of Suavity Her smiling self presented to her Eye. 22 But humane Souls are in Capacity So poor and dull whilst here they dwell below; They know not how to bear ev'n Courtesy, Unless by slow degrees on them it grow. Delights, if rushing in a sudden stream, A Deluge of amazing Torments seem. 23 This Spectacle bred such Extremities Of mighty Comforts in the Virgin's Mind, That she, alas, too narrow to comprise Her own most sweetly-raging Sea, resign'd Her self to Delicacie's Wrack, and down These pleasing Depths sunk gently by a S[w]own. 24 But Charis being Mistress of the Tide, So bridled in the swelling Floods, that they Submitted to her hand their dainty Pride, And for her gentler Complement made way: This was a soft Embrace, by which the Maid She girded, and her fainting Passion staid. 25 Allaying then her glorious Aspect by More tolerable Sweets, she thus began: Has short Disuse such nauseous Potency That it upon my cheerly Presence can Disrellish cast; or are my Beams too strong For One who hath in Darkness grop'd so long? 26 Henceforth take Courage, for no more will I (And here I pawn to thee my royal Word,) Leave me to wade in gloomy Misery, But trusty Light to all thy Ways afford; Full broad-day Light: for all this while I gave Thee secret Beams which thou didst not perceive. 27 Had I not help'd thee so; had I not lain Close at the bottom of thy Heart, to keep Thy Soul's Foundation firm and sure; in vain Laborious Zeal had duely broke thy sleep, In vain had all thy Sighs and Tears been spent, In vain thy Prayers had to Heav'n been sent. 28 Unto its dismal Name too truly true Thy Dereliction would have prov'd, had I, With never-sleeping Care not lain perdu To watch the Motions of thine Enemy; That Enemy, whose Company alone Is that which perfects Desolation. 29 When that infernal Hag, the damned Queen Of Hideousness, advanced to the fight Armed both Hand and Tongue; had I not been In thy main Fort, her potent Engins might Have eas'ly undermined it, and Thou Had'st by Despair been quite blown up e'r now. 30 For Humane Constitution, alas Is fram'd of faint and frail Materials; no Immortal Adamant, or sturdy Brass, Secures thy fabrick, and defies thy Fo: Thy Walls are crumbling treacherous Dust, which flies In thy Soul's face, and blinds thy Reason's eyes. 31 Yet close I lurk'd, thy Courage so to try When thou no Second could'st perceive at hand. This was the Plot of LOVE himself, and I My Ambush placed but at his Command: LOVE hid my face, and so he did his own; But all that while He weav'd for thee a Crown. 32 The Crown which thy long loyal Patience I'th' highest Realm of humblest Saints shalt wear: And till thou thither art translated hence, I in thy Breast my open Tent will rear; That till the greater Heav'n receiveth Thee, Thou may'st contain it in Epitomy. 33 This said: She gather'd up her Train of light, Which in an Orb was all about her spread; And shrinking up her self by Heav'nly slight Within her sprightfull self, re-entered The Virgin's Breast; where her Dominion she Began to show by entheous Energie. 34 Forthwith a Tumult boil'd in Psyche's Heart, But boil'd and foam'd in vain; for instantly The Rout by Charis's most victorious Art Was forc'd from that usurped Hold to fly. Vain Dread was first who shrunk and turned head, And so these Cowards flying Army led. 35 For she her self no sooner shiver'd out, But at her heels lamenting Sorrow came, Accompany'd with blind and groping Doubt; Then lear-ey'd Jealousy, unworthy Shame, Palefac'd Disconsolation, and Frigidity, With Indevotion's dead and stiff Aridity. 36 But in the Rear rush'd forth Forgetfulness, A dim-ey'd swarthy Crone; and hand in hand Led her Compatriots and Complices, Gross sluggish Mists, dull Night, thick Blackness, and What ever is of kin to them, whatever Can block up Heav'n, and Souls from Light dissever. 37 Compar'd with these, all Soot and Ink, and Pitch, Were Compositions of Milk and Snow; So was the tough and triduan Darkness, which Beclogg'd the Impudence of Memphis's brow; And that which lock'd up Sodom's eyelids more Close than Lot's Care and Fear had done his Door. 38 Psyche with blushing Joy admiring stood Her own Heart's strange fertility to see. She little dreamt so hideous a Brood Could nestling in her Virgin Bosom be; Whose foul mishapen features while she read, She thought her self Delivered indeed. 39 But they remembring where they first were bred, And hoping for more quiet harbour there; In scrambling haste from Psyche's triumph fled, Whose gladsome Eye with Torments scorch'd them here: Downward they fled, and in Sin's proper Womb, Hell's gloomy furnace, sought their cooler Home. 40 And now she found her Bosom's Orb as clear As when to Heav'n she Thelema presented; Now all her Passions unhamper'd were, And every Bond to Liberty relented: All things look'd sweet and fair within, and she Rejoyc'd in her complete Serenity. 41 Love, Anger, Hatred, Jealousy, and Fear, And all the rest of that swiftwinged Crew, With Sprightfulness revived were, And to their proper Objects nimbly flew: Nor clash'd they any more their Wings together, But kindly help'd and cheered one another. 42 Hope, which had grop'd and languished till now In deplorable Mists; fresh courage took, And challeng'd every Wind its worst to blow, Since she perceiv'd her Cable was not broke, But that her trusty Anchor held its hold, Whilst Desolation's Sea about her roll'd. 43 And Logos too, sad heretofore and dry, Felt cheerly Vigor leaping in his Heart; Which spurr'd his Zeal to beg Her leave to try, Whither he could not now perform his part With more successful strength, and from the Treasures Of Heav'n, fetch Contemplation's solid Pleasures. 44 His Motion She embrac'd with joyeuse Ear; And turn'd to Heav'n her sparkling Eye, to see Whether the Way to it companion were In her brisk Bosom's new Serenity: She turn'd her Eye, and in Heav'n's Volumes read A Lesson, which did ev'n her wish exceed. 45 For lo, the sullen Clouds which heretofore Had damm'd the Road to her rejected Sight, Down in repentant Tears themselves did poure, Contending which should first clear up a bright And undisturbed Passage to that Sphere Where Psyche's Jewels all inshrined were. 46 In bounteous Beams of royal Influence Her open Sun bestow'd himself upon her; And this awak'd her long-astonish'd sense To revel in this Feast of sweetest Honor. This swell'd her Bosom with such Ravishment That through her Lips she hast's to give it vent. 47 And now, O my delicious Lord, said she, I thank thee for that Famin I endured: What Hope could fancy this Felicity Would by that torturing Anguish be procured! But in the Prudence of thy Love didst Thou Then make me Fast, the more to Feast me now. 48 Thou by that wholesom Tempest tossedst me, That I might thoroughly understand the Bliss Of this pure Calm: by that Severity Of tedious breathing Death, didst Thou suppress My secular Spirits, that revived I Might Live to Thee, as to the World I die. 49 Now, now, I taste this Life indeed, which I, Though I possest, enjoyed not before. Alas, we fools are best instructed by Absence and Loss to prize the richest Store: These Thanks my Dereliction I owe That thus I rellish my Fruition now. 50 So deep I rellish't, that convinced I Would not for all the Streams of Paradise But have been drown'd in that Aridity, Whence to the Bliss of mine own Bliss I rise. For what were Paradise to me, unless I feelingly perceiv'd its Pleasantness? 51 Wise King of Souls! who knowest how to make Severity the sweetest way of Love; And nearest drawst when thou dost most Forsake Thy fainting Worms. How far, how far above Our Retribution is thy Goodness, which Transcends our highest Comprehension's reach! 52 O that more Thelemas I had, which I Might sacrifice as Tokens of this Debt; Since thy revealed Count'nance upon my Unworthy Head this mighty Score hath set! Yet what do our poor Wills by being Thine, But only make Themselves, not Thee, divine? 53 Thy vast Munificence on Me bestows All that Ambition could desire, and more: Whence is it Jesu then that Psyche grows Ev'n in this Ocean of Abundance poor? I have—, What have I not in having Thee? Yet still me thinks I Covetous could be. 54 I could be Covetous, and wish that all The Wealth of Heav'n and Earth were soley mine, That with this Off'ring I might prostrate fall, And dedicate it at thy Favour's Shrine. Yet what were all this World to that which I Owe to thy sovereign Benignity! 55 Had I ten thousand Lives to spend on thee, That vast Expence would but my Gains augment: How then, where Gratitude her self must be Ingrate, can needy I due Thanks present! Sweet Lord inform and help my Soul, which fain Would render something back to Thee again. 56 She ceased here; and Phylax, who attended The leisure of her fervent Exultation; With equal Heat and Gladness, where she ended Began her Praises and Congratulation: Joy, Joy, dear Pupil, of this Morn, said He, Which hath dispell'd thy Night of misery. 57 I see what reason forc'd thee to be sad Beyond my Comfort's reach: because I see The high occasion which hath made thee glad: Such mighty Grief could only chased be By that meridian all-potent Ray Which drives the life of Wo, ev'n Death, away. 58 And here th'Excess of his triumphant Joy Would let him speak no more, but spurr'd him on With Kisses and Embraces to allay The dainty fierceness of his Passion; Full close he chain'd her in the tender Bands Of Zealous Love, his blessed Arms and Hands. 59 The Maid, who would not to this Compliment Be long in debt, thus in a smile reply'd: The begging of my Pardon you prevent, But must not stop my Thanks most bounden Tide; The only Tide which can returned be Upon your mighty Flood of Love to me. 60 Surely the other day you were the same Which you are now, in every Ornament Of gracious sweetness, when you hither came With ready Cordials of divine Content: But clownish senseless I could not embrace Your undeserved yet obtruded Grace. 61 Had this Behaviour quench'd your Charity, To none but my rude self had Blame been due. Yet you with faithful patient Fervency More careful still, and still more tender grew: My very Griefs into your bosom you Admitted, and for me with tears did flow. 62 Though I by Heav'n and Earth abandon'd was, And plung'd into the Gulf of Desolation; To own me in that despicable Case You blushed not; but by your sweet Narration Of what Love destin'd to relieve my smart Endeavor'd to advance my drooping heart. 63 Well I remember how I then forgot My self and you; how dead and cold I lay Before that flaming News, which would have shot Life into any Soul but mine; away I turn'd my foolish head from that which through A thousand Deaths I would run after now. 64 For what is Death? which is not when it is; A dreadful Nothing, ending where it 'gins, And dead as soon as We: But heav'nly Bliss In its own boundless Circle lives, and shines With endless Glory; yet without Regard Thy Proffer of this Happiness I heard. 65 But now, O indefatigable friend, I feel thy Comforts thrilling in my heart, Which there with Charis's quickning Influence blend, And to my soul another soul impart. Surely my mind can never thee forget Who helpest to revive and double it. 66 When Earth denies her Vapors to repay To Heav'n, whose Bounty sent her down the Rain; When Fountains bid their posting Currents stay, Whose Thanks were flowing to their Mother Main; Their faithful Buttresses when Buildings scorn; Then I'l upon thy Love, Neglect return. 67 In this Contention of Court'sy they Their Words and Kisses sweetly bandied; Until the dim decrepit Time of Day, Which common mortals summoneth to bed, Admonish'd Psyche of her Compline; who Obey'd the Item, and to Pray'rs did go. 68 Which most sublime and holy bus'ness she Perform'd no more with cold and fruitless pains; But mounting with encourag'd fervency, Reap'd in the middle of her Work, its Gains, And found her Intercessions wellcom'd were Into her Spouse's ready open Ear. 69 Phylax mean while by Heav'n's appointment flew To learn her Parents' fortunes out: which he No sooner had descry'd, but fill'd with new Powers of Joy, he posted back as she From her Devotions rose; and thus display'd The blessed Tidings to the reverend Maid: 70 News Psyche, happy News! for now I come From holy Valor's Scene, that signal Place Where thy Uranius his brave Martyrdom Of late atchiev'd, and finish'd Virtue's Race; That Race thou feardst had been too hard for thy Decrepit Parents limping Piety. 71 But at the Stake I found them both, where they Before the face of Heav'n and Earth, to thy Sole Charge that Resolution's strength did lay, Which fir'd them to contemn those Flames; for by Our Daughter's Zeal, said they, this sacred Heat In our old frozen fearful Veins doth beat. 72 Here we acknowledge, that right nobly she Hath more than quit the Debt she us did ow: 'Twas but the Life of poor Mortality Which from our Loins she borrowed; but now Her generous Love embraves us to ascend Where flourisheth that Life which knows no End. 73 That heav'nly Answer from her Dungeon she Gave to our cruel Kindness, though with shame It sent us weeping home; yet instantly Those causeless Tears it dried by this flame Of Christian Courage, whilst admonish'd by Our second Thoughts our first we did defy. 74 Where e'r she is, may Heav'n her Care requite, Who whilst we tempted her to idolize, Us from Idolatry did wisely fright; And teach us how we safelier might despise Both Life and Death, than Jesus, who alone Holds over Both supreme Dominion. 75 Then let him shew it now; the Soldiers cry'd, Kindling the Pile; and shouting loud, that they Had, malgrè Darkness, leave to turn the Tide Of Night, by Christian Bonfires, into Day. O blessed Pair! said I, who in a new Marriage are joined thus: and hither flew. 76 So Phylax spake: when She surprised by This blessed News's shock, could not contain The pious fountain of her loyal Eye, Nor yet her Tongue's more swelling streams restrain: Abundant Tears she shed; but larger far Her Thanks to Jesus, and her Praises were. 77 Before, alas, her thoughts could not bestow A Visit on her Parents, till they had Travell'd into the heart of Hell: but now A grateful Progress they in triumph made, Climbing the Pinacle of Heav'n, where She, Since they were there, aforehand seems to be. 78 But as she oft had wearied been before With Heavinesse's cumbrous Burden; so Surcharged now with Joy's unbounded store, She laid her down in sweet submission to This pleasing Load, and sunk into the deep But soft untroubled gulf of downy sleep. 79 When Charis, upon whose eternal Eye No slumber ever creeps, begun a new Mysterious Work; for with activity About Imagination's Orb she flew, And cull'd and crop'd those Fancies here and there Which for her Purpose serviceable were. 80 Thus furnished, with all Materials, she Upon the theater of Psyche's breast By orderly degrees the Gallantry Of an incomparable Pageant drest. She first rear'd up a goodly Throne, whose Light Outvy'd the hyperborean Snow in white. 81 Forthwith she placed on that royal Seat A Prince, who with more Beauty garnish'd it. No Monarch ever in more awful State On his imperial glistering Chair did sit. Indeed all Potentates but shadows be To this authentick sovereign's Majesty. 82 His copious Robe down from his shoulders flow'd To his fair Feet with streams of Gracefulness; A Girdle of illustrious Gold, which ow'd Its birth not unto Earth, but Heav'n, did kiss And closely hug his blessed Loins, which yet In goodly Richness far outshined it. 83 No Fuller's Labour ever made so white The finest Wool, as was his daintier Hair; Which poured down the volumes of its bright And curled Wealth with curious careless Care About his Alabaster Neck; which stood Like some white Pillar in that snowy Wood. 84 As in their venerable Sockets on The sacred Altar glorious Tapers flame, So look'd his Eyes; whose reverend Beams alone About the Temple of his Face did stream; Which parallel'd the Sun's best Looks when He Is awful in his highnoon Clarity. 85 The most refin'd Corinthian Brass which in The bosom of th'incensed Furnace glows, With such fair Terror ne'r was known to shine As from his burning Feet of Glory flows. Thus was this radiant King from foot to head With Majesty's Excess embellished. 86 Innumerable Angels then she brought To furnish out his Court and fill his Train; Who their bright Stations took as quick as Thought, And with their golden Trumpets in a strain, Which through the roused Universe rebounded, The glory of their mighty Sovereign sounded. 87 Forthwith His Standard to the open Air She poured out; in which embroider'd stood, Most dreadfully-illustrious and fair, His Arms Imperial stained all with blood: For 'twas his Cross, encompass'd now with more Notorious Honor than with Shame before. 88 As thus He sate triumphant on his Throne, He lifted up his Face and look'd about: Straitway the frighted Earth confus'dly ran From his intollerable Eyes; the stout And hardy hearts of Rocks were split with Dread; The proudest Hills and Mountains trembling fled. 89 To their salt Home all Floods forgot their way, And tumbled into Nothing's deeper Deep: The highest Tides, seiz'd with profound Dismay, Into an universal Eb did creep; The Sands devour'd the Waves they fear'd before, And now the middle of the Sea was Shore. 90 The Spheres above, his Aspect's Power felt, And breaking off their lofty Harmony, In Dissolution's final Tears did melt: The dazel'd Sun and Stars, abash'd to see There was no need of them by Day or Night, Fell headlong down, and choaked their own Light. 91 Yet in this hudling Haste, the Sea and Land Were mindful of their Faith, and honestly Restor'd all Pledges put into their hand By Fate, Sin, Vengeance and Mortality; Giving up punctually a true and just Account of every Dram of Human Dust. 92 When lo, Corruption started from the Heap Of Ashes, and fled after Earth and Sea: Forthwith the Mass threw off its deadly Sleep, And waked into Life's Activity: Each Piece awak'd, and nimbly Rose, and shew'd For one cold Lump, a vigorous Multitude. 93 Adam and Eve, the Springs of all the Rest, Led up the Front: on whom attended all The Senior World; Then Noah forward prest, Who reimpeopled th'ancient shipwrack'd Ball: And after Him step'd every Nation forth Whose Colonies had swarm'd through all the Earth. 94 Not One was missing now, who ever drew The breath of Life, or saw the face of Light: Yea They whom Nature's self yet never knew, As lying in Futurity's blind Night Lock'd up to furnish after Ages, there In their Ideal Beings did appear. 95 But yet the Proudest bore his head as low As did the poorest and ignoblest Wight; Nor was the starch'd and silken Gallant now More sprucely than the leathern Shepherd dight: This Day had rased such Distinctions out, And All to one just garb and fashion brought. 96 They whom their tedious Age had bowed down, Were to their brisker years remanded back; And they who in their Bud were crop'd, and thrown Into untimely Graves, did nothing lack Of full-grown and accomplish'd Vigor; which Fix'd all and every One in equal Pitch. 97 Yet still so different their Conditions were, That now the ready Angels, who attended Their Sovereign's Beck, with quick unerring Care Parted the Crowd, which was together blended; To his Right hand the harmless Sheep they drew, But to his Left the stinking Goats they threw. 98 Psyche rejoyc'd her Parents here to see Rank'd in the Dexter Wing: but fuller was Her holy Exultation, when she Perceiv'd her own Effigies had the grace There to be marshalled; and though she slept, Her waking Soul at that sweet Omen leapt. 99 When lo, as thus her Hopes and Joys grew high At this illustrious Spectacle; before The Throne two mighty Books were open by The Angels flung: no Volumes ever bore So huge a bulk as these, which written be With all the World's eternal Destiny. 100 The One was black as Horror's darkest Face, The Book of Death daub'd with the Ink of Hell; Wherein each Word some ugly Trespass was, Scor'd on their sad account, who needs would spil Their pains to gain Vexation, and in spight Of offer'd Bliss, against their Maker fight. 101 The other shew'd as fair, as this was foul; The beauteous Book of Life; where every Line Shin'd brighter than those Notes that made the Scroul Of Heav'n appear so glorious and divine. No Letters here, but Part of God express Character'd in his Servant's Holyness. 102 These blessed Leaves the King no sooner read, But to the Right-hand Troop he turn'd his Eye, Which with majestick sweetness prefaced To these high Words: Come ye whose Piety Is by my Father's Benediction grown Mature, and of full age to wear its Crown. 103 Come take your due Possession now with me Of that bright Kingdom, whose Foundations were Lay'd upon stable Perpetuity Long e'r the Earth sunk down beneath, long e'r The Air and Fire grew light and upward fled, Long e'r the Curtains of the Heav'ns were spred. 104 For in this faithful Register I see Your brave Deserts recorded full and fair: When I exposed lay to Misery, Your pious Charity made me your Heir: The Debt I here acknowledge, and to Day Both Principal and Use I must repay. 105 I grant, in person I did never crave Your tender Love's Assistance; yet what you To any of my needy Members gave, Has Me their mindful Head oblig'd: and now Your Souls shall find I'l full Requital make For whatsoe'r by Proxy I did take. 106 Then turning to the gloomy Book, and to The Lefthand Squadrons who stood all aghast; With frowns of killing Wrath He cryed, Go Ye cursed Brood, this Evidence hath cast Your Plea, and these true Leaves full witness bear Of your foul Crimes which all stand staring here. 107 Your Eyes no Pity would afford to Me When Prison, Hunger, Thirst, and Nakedness Call'd for Compassion: and strict Equity Now seals up Mine against your due Distress. Go, and your deeply-earned Places take Amidst the everburning Brimstone Lake. 108 The Lake my Fury kindled to requite With challeng'd Vengeance that rebellious Pride, Which flam'd against my Self in open fight, When Satan and his Crew their Stomachs try'd. For you I meant it not; but you alone Have snatch'd your shares in their Damnation. 109 The adamantine Doom thus being past; The guardian Angels with impatient Joy Their several and well-known Saints embrac't, Applauding this their Coronation Day: And then their Tongues they join'd with Them to sing Ecstatick Praises to their gracious King. 110 But as this Melody was sweet and high; So were the Outcries horrid, which did tear The throats and hearts of all that Company Who to Death's living Furnace sentenc'd were: Numberless Devils strait about them flew, And in their face Dispairs and Terrors threw. 111 But dressed in a more affrighting shape Than ever yet infernal Hag deformed, Their monstrous Consciences on them did clap Their Tallons of eternal Wrath, all armed With thousand Stings, which on the wretches prey'd, And in their Souls outrageous havock made. 112 Just, Just, cry'd they, your Sentence is; and though In Life you needs would stop your squeamish ear Against the Clamor of our Truth; yet you In Death for evermore our Cry shall hear. Thus their own Bosom's Verdict roar'd, forestalling Hell's hideous yellings whether they were falling. 113 For on the sudden that infernal Pit Opening its Mouth, and gaping for its Prey; Their Flames' Firstfruits began on Them to spit, And warn'd the Feinds to hasten them away To their full Harvest. O what Tongue can tell The Anguish which these Captives now befel! 114 Upon their shrieking Throats, and frighted Hair Damnation's Sergeants flung their fiery Paws; Whilst Troops of Furies, who appointed were With burning Whips of Snakes, and Harpies' Claws, Lash'd them so sore, that haste they made to Hell In hopes less salvage Torments there did dwell. 115 In plung'd the mighty Rout, and almost split The greedy Throat of black Perdition's Deep: Loud was the Noise of this great Fall; but yet Far louder was their Cry, who down the steep Eternal Precipice still tumbled, and No Bottom saw to bid their Ruin stand. 116 The hasty Fire soon flew upon this Feast, And with unbounded Riot gormandised; Resolving thenceforth never more to Fast, Nor yet with all this store to be sufficed; Although th'o'rcharged Grot its Fulness spoke, By belching up contagious Stink and Smoke. 117 About the brink some Devils hanker'd still; So did two Monsters uglier far than They, Thin ghastly Death, and pois'nous Sin; until The King design'd an Angel Them to slay, Who threw them headlong down the Pit; for this And this alone, eternal Slaughter is. 118 That done: the Sentence firm and sure to make, Upon the Cave's wide Mouth his Seal he set: A Seal which no Reluctancy can break Since his Omnipotence hath temper'd it Of such a mixture that Eternity It self, as soon as that, shall brittle be. 119 The Saints and Angels seeing Nothing now But Joy, and Life, and Bliss, and Holyness; Before the Conquerer's Throne their faces threw, In meek Ambition hasting to profess Their thankful Souls in Triumph's stateliest Song; Whence all the World with Hallelujahs rung. 120 When lo, a Flood of new and gorgeous Light Pour'd sweetly down from th'everlasting Hill; Which drown'd the Scene, and swallow'd up from sight Th'outshined Luster of that Spectacle. This fetch'd a sigh from Psyche, who had view'd With hearty Joy that holy Multitude. 121 But Charis, to revive her fainting Cheer, Whom empty Claritude could not suffice; A sudden City on the Stage did rear, Whose Beauty so enamor'd Psyche's eyes That she was sad no longer for the Change, But joy'd about the stately Pile to range. 122 For ne'r did sweeter Graces trip about The blooming Count'nance of a royal Bride, Who by all strength of Delicacy sought To ravish her great Spouse; than beautify'd This virgin City's face, which pleas'd the Eye Of th'awful Sovereign of Eternity. 123 Square shew'd the Platform, destin'd for the Seat Of everlasting Firmitude; for this Substantial Figure feareth no Defeat By any bold Concussion's boistrousness: Whereas the Round and eas'ly rolling World, Alas, before was into Nothing whirld. 124 The Fabrick of the Wall rose fair and high; Much higher than the proudest Battlement Of th'ancient Heav'ns, whose lofty Majesty Down unto Mortall Eyes such Wonder sent; For they were but the Tipe and Shade of This Which Heav'n of Heav'ns, and Glory's Glory is. 125 And with this princely Height the mighty Base Held correspondence; for on Twelve Foundations All most unmov'd, the Building mounted was, And laught at any Thought of Perturbations. The only Garrison of Rest was this, And stable Peace's grand Metropolis. 126 The First Foundation was of Jasper green; For Florid must this Structure ever be: The next of Sapphir, in whose face were seen The proper Lines of heav'nly Clarity; A Stone which fortifies all drooping Hearts, And friendly Help to Chastity imparts. 127 The Third, of radiant Chalcedony; which Judiciously upon the Sapphir set, With Constellations doth its Ground enrich. A cheerly Gem is this, and scorns to let The tedious Insultations of Fear Or bold Dispair, entrench upon its sphere. 128 The Fourth of Emerald, of filthy Lust, And every other Poison too, the Fo: The Fifth of Sardonix, in Blushes drest: The Sixth of Sardy, Antidote of Wo, Quickner of Wit: the Seaventh of Chrysolite, Which frights away dull Melancholy's Night. 129 The Eight of Beril, rich in Modest Grace: The Ninth of Topaz, full of flaming Gold: The Tenth, his sparkling Cousen Chrysoprase: The next, the cordial Jacinth, which the cold And sinking Heart invigorates: the Last, The sober and the healthful Amethist. 130 On these Foundations fairly graven stand Twelve honored Names; the Names of Them who spred The Lamb's bless'd Blood through thousand Chanels, and The Stones to build this City gathered From every soil, and from the furthest shores On which the barbarous Ocean foams and roars. 131 As Psyche reach'd her Wonder round about This gallant Structure; she on every side Three most magnifick Gates, each carved out Of one intire and masty Pearl, espy'd: By these great LOVE kept open House, and all The East and West, the North and South did call. 132 Invited therefore thus, she enter'd in; Where pav'd with solid Gold she found the Street; With Gold not of our earthly Metals kin, But of a higher purer Breed, and meet Saints feet to kiss: for more tralucid 'twas Than is the fairest Cheek of virgin Glass. 133 But strait a brighter Spectacle she met, A River all of living Crystal, which Came smiling down the glorious Street; and beat Its rugged Path of Gems with Musick: such Chastly-enamoring Loves and Joys did ne'r Sport it in Fancy's Spring, as bathed there. 134 Each Bank was guarded by a goodly Row Of one divinely multiplied Tree; Whose wide-stretch'd Arms did courteously bestow Upon the Flood a fair green Canopy, Whose ever-verdant Twigs, though sound and strong, Bow'd with the blessed Fruit which on them hung. 135 Twelve sorts of Fruits it duly bore, and yet Fail'd not each Month again to bud and blow; Such endless Vigor liv'd and reign'd in it As with more sovereign Virtue did endow The smallest Leaves, than e'r was known to drop From famous Gilead's all-balmy Top. 136 They ne'r were mustered against the wound Of any Nations, but the conquer'd Pain Fled from its Hold, and left it whole and sound, When humane Surgery had sought in vain. O noble Tree! whose only Shadow is Th'eternal Roof of sure substantial Bliss. 137 Under these mighty Boughs, and on this Shore Of flowing Life, walk'd Psyche to descry What Spring could be the Mother to such Store Of pure and everteeming Suavity: When lo, a glorious Throne she spy'd, from whence Gush'd out these vivid Blisses' Influence. 138 A Throne of pure and solid splendor framed, On which the Monarch of Immensity With such intollerable Brightness flamed That none of all the purest Standers by Could with Cherubick or Seraphick eyes His vast Irradiations comprise. 139 But at his right Hand, mitigated by His marriage with Flesh, there sate the Lamb; Whose spotless Fleece was sweetned Majesty; Whose Scepter smiled with Love's gentle flame; Whose Hand, to poure his Blessings forth, was spread; Whose Crown was Honor, wreath'd about his Head. 140 From this fair Throne flow'd that eternal Day Which all this new Jerusalem doth gild: No other Phebus needed to display Himself upon this Region, which was fill'd With such enlivening Fires as could refine Ev'n gross and mortal Eyes into Divine. 141 Here Psyche clearly read those wonders she Before by Logos, her Embassador, Through Distance's large Veil did dimly see: God's naked Attributes were marshal'd here; Deep Mysteries in one another wove, Infinitudes, and Miracles of Love. 142 Here vast oraculous Profoundities, And wondrous Words from Wisdom's lips she heard; Such Words, as taught her what the reason is Why God himself doth wear the Name of Word; Words raised to so sovereign a pitch As Mortal Tongues must never hope to reach. 143 Here she beheld how from Divinity Beatitude her glorious Self display'd; And unto all the holy Company A Deluge of Munificence convey'd, For Millions of Millions th'honor had About th'illustrious Throne themselves to spread. 144 Most matchless was the Equipage in which Their Ranges shined: that symmetrious Grace Which through all Heav'n and Earth did Beauty reach, To this far fairer World gave willing place, When, guilty only of it self, it slunk Aside, and into Inanition sunk. 145 Nor e'r was Grecian or Roman Court (Through Fame had trumpeted their Praises high) Contrived in such wise majestick Port As this, Perfection's own Polity, Which by one universal Spirit moves, And by no Laws is governed but Loves. 146 All Saints and Angels knew their proper Station, And lov'd it best, because it was their own: Among them all no jarring Inclination E'r aimd at Discord; for each one had thrown His Will down at his Sovereign's footstool, and Own'd no Desires but only His Command. 147 In Him they liv'd, and lov'd, and joy'd, and by That Resignation received were Into their Master's own Immensity; Since Jesus's Fulness had enough to spare, Nor was his Diadem diminish'd, though To all of them their Crowns He did allow. 148 They All were Crown'd, and yet not flattered With titular and empty Sovereignty: O no! such cheating Honors all were fled Away, and with the mouldering World did die. This Sea of Bliss, of Kingdoms was the Spring, And every Subject made a mighty King. 149 For what was proper unto every one Prov'd both the Joy and Riches of the Rest: That Glorie's Excellence which flam'd upon The Head of Jesus, fully was possest By all this Multitude; for bounteous He In Common laid his own Propriety. 150 Thus whatsoever Honor decks the Brow, Or Consolation smileth in the Heart; Its Beams are not confined there, but flow With brotherly Delight to every Part; That all the Body may engaged be To make a private Comfort, publick Glee. 151 And yet these so united Spirits were Diversify'd by Classical Degrees; Nine goodly Orders shin'd distinctly there, Which in Three Hierarchick Unities Conjoin'd again, and by their single Three Thrice copyed th'eternal Trinity. 152 With these the mingled Saints had leave to reign, And fill those Spirits' Rooms, who traiterously Hoping against their Maker to maintain Their Stomach's Quarrel, needs their Arms would try; But overwhelm'd by His Almighty Tide, Their Ruin only gained by their Pride. 153 Nor did the Angels' noble Hearts repine To see the lowborn Sons of rotten earth Made their Companions, and advanc'd to shine Above the Heavens: for since the mighty Birth Of their Incarnate God, they could not say But Dust it self was more Divine than They. 154 By that proportion of Humility, And holy Love they practis'd here below, Their Guerdons Measures on these Saints the high And righteous King of Bounty modell'd now: Which though much gradual Difference they shew'd, Yet every One enjoyed Plenitude. 155 So of a thousand Vessels great and small Into the Ocean thrown, though some receive A larger portion of the Waves, yet All Brim full are fill'd; nor can the Meanest grieve Their Brethren's fairer Amplitude to see, Since they no fuller than the smallest be. 156 But how to blazon these bright Honors; how To sound this boundless Sea of equal Pleasures; How to compute this vast Account, and know The total Sum of perfect Bliss's Treasures; Pos'd all their highest strength and deepest wit Who were infeofed and possest of it. 157 Yet all the Homage that they paid for this Supremacy of Glory, was but Praise, Pour'd forth in high ecstatick Chanting His Eternal Name and Fame, who them did raise To this Capacity of Exultation. O blessed Life! whose Task is Acclamation. 158 Through this illustrious Maze of Joy and Bliss As Psyche laboured, and seem'd to be In Heav'n afresh at every step; by this Unwearied Quir's heroick Peans she Fancy'd the Entertainment near as high, Which rouz'd her Ear, as that which fill'd her Eye. 159 The sweetest Powers of mortal String and Voice Had courted oft and complemented Her; But charmed now by this soul-cheering Noise, She thinks she ne'r true Musick heard but here: Nor can she grant that Blessedness doth so In Vision reign, as not in Hearing too. 160 The strong Assault of that all-glorious Sight, And this strange Harmony, perplexed Her In sweet Confusion: for by This Delight She tempted was to wish her self all Ear; By that, intirely Eye; or else that she Could teach her Eyes to hear, her Ears to see. 161 At length her Wonder could endure no Rein, But sacrific'd her Soul to Ecstacy: When lo, the Seraphs Pipes let flie a strein Of holy Triumph so exceeding high, That starting at the mighty Song, she shaked Her precious Dream in sunder, and awaked. 162 As when unhappy Adam was expell'd From Bliss's Scene, joy-planted Paradise, And on the sudden all the World beheld Set thick with helpless thorny Miseries: With Sighs and Sobs his woful hands he wrung, To think from Whence, and Whether he was flung. 163 Thus Psyche seiz'd with lamentable fright To see the face of gross Mortality; To see the glaring Beams of Nature's Light; To see her self on her poor pallet lie, So far remov'd from Bliss's royal sphere That on dull Earth she still was groveling here: 164 Cry'd out, Alas what injury have I E'r done to Sleep, that it should mock me thus? To heave me up into the glorious Sky Why should my Dreams be so industrious, If me by this Defection treacherous They Back to this Deep intended to betray? 165 Unhappy Life! which whilst we are Awake With nothing else but Dreams enchantst our eyes. The burly Show this Mortal World doth make, Is but a puffed Bulk of Vanities, Where whilst we hope substantial Worth to find We cheated are with foolish empty wind. 166 But when by Sleep we robbed are of more Than half our Selves, and in Death's Emblem lie, Then only wilt thou suffer us to sore To solid Joys; which yet deserted by Our flitting faithless Dreams that buoy'd them up, Strait into wretched Nothing headlong drop. 167 Deceitful Sleep, which wear'st the Name of Rest, Why wilt thou never make it good to me? Why was I with thy highest Favors blest, If they must but my waking Torture be? Why slept I, if I needs must start, and miss By setting ope mine eyes, my sight of Bliss? 168 How much more Comfort is it to be Blind Than that our eyes should only witness be Of what our Souls must needs abhor to find, The Flight and Loss of our Felicity! And can such Eyes be dry? which said, she wept, And her Complaints in briney currents steep'd. 169 But Phylax, who had with his piercing eye Div'd through her breast, and was Spectator there Whilst Charis order'd all that Pageantry Upon her wondring Soul's fair theatre, Stop'd with a Kiss that Tide of Grief which ran From her complaining Lips; then thus began: 170 To Joy this Morning sacred is, my Dear; And if thy Bottles thou wouldst rightly spend, On Sorrow lavish not the smallest Tear, But all thy Streams to Exultation lend. Thy Dream has not deceiv'd thee; all was true Which it display'd to thine admiring View. 171 It is enough that Heav'n hath condescended To act it self aforehand unto Thee: Nor canst thou think thy Savior e'r intended To put thee off with Dreams: No; royal He Prepares thine Eyes by this short glimpse of Bliss Henceforth to see its endless bright Excess. 172 In patience then thine humble Soul possess; For sure this Prize is worth thine Expectation, Yea though it should attended be till this Firm World grows weak, and stoops to Consummation: Time at its utmost Tether cannot be More than a Span to vast Eternity. 173 Eternity, is that which shall inhance Beatitude, and crown its Diadems: In hopes of which do thou thy Soul advance, And ne'r dejected be to think that Dreams, Which on thin Fancy their foundation lay, Are fickle fluid things, and start away. 174 Courageous Friend, the Maid to this reply'd, Brave is the Metal of thy sprightful Heart; Which easly beats back all Misfortune's Tide, And can the Streams of Grief to Joy convert: Full well with Thee those Looks of Triumph suit, Who all my Loss canst with a Smile confute. 175 But I can not do so; Mischances throw Their cruel Smiles on mine with high Disdain: My deep Passivity will not allow Me any power or cunning to maintain A fight with Suff'rings so as not to feel The Wound, when in my heart I find the Steel. 176 It is but lately since unhappy I Was lost, quite lost in Mists of Desolation: And heavy was that blind Calamity Which muffled up my quick-ey'd Contemplation, And clipt those Wings that had been us'd before Unto the Pinnacles of Heav'n to sore. 177 But now her eyes again unmasked are, And unto useful strength her feathers grown; No sooner I in Heav'n's illustrious sphere Or read, or fly, but I am tumbled down, And by my journy (to complete my Cross) No Profit reap but Knowledge of my loss. 178 O I acquit my Dream from any Guilt Of fairfac'd Fraud; in every blessed Part The genuine pulse of Truth I clearly felt Which beat right time with my exultant Heart. I would not have it False for Heav'n, and yet Its being True begets this deep Regret. 179 Had it not prov'd it self th'unfeined scene Of brave Beatitude in full display; Without this stinging Torment that had been Snatched from Me, or I from that, away: But now what Comfort's breath can blow Content When from my Heart my Heart it self is rent? 180 If Lucifer had never walk'd upon Complete Felicitie's transcendent Stories, If he had ne'r beheld Heav'n's radiant Throne, Nor grown acquainted with the Court of Glories; His Loss had finite been; and though he fell To Ruin's Gulf, his Hell had not been Hell. 181 I might have dwelt contented in dead Night Had I not known and seen Life's royal Day: These rotten rags of Dust and Ashes might Have pleased me, had not the rich Array Of Immortality which shines so bright Upon the backs of Saints, ravish'd my sight. 182 The Ardor of my Thirst might eas'ly by That simple Brook have cool'd, and quenched been, Had not that Crystal run into mine Eye, Whose all-enlivening Current glides between Those two Plantations of tall Life, which flourish With sovereign Health, and all faint Nations cherish. 183 Yon Phebus, who with virgin Gold doth gild The Morning's cheeks, with some delight might I Have gazed on; If I had not beheld My Lord's more sunlike Eyes, with Majesty Sparkling, and Joy, and Love, and everything Which can accomplish Glorie's gracious King. 184 Then since I fully understand my Loss; O do not envy me, sweet Guardian, leave Not to be fondly stupid; do not cross My Wo's carreer who have such cause to grieve: For Grief their Daughter's only dowry is, Whilst my dear Parents reign in joyous Bliss. 185 These words with such commanding Passion she On facil Phylax blew, as made him yield; And this the rather, since deep-pondering He Mark'd now how wisely LOVE his Plot conceal'd: For Psyche knew not He for her this kind Of softest-hardest Martyrdom design'd. 186 But Charis (to augment her Agony,) Although the blessed Dream had taken wing, Yet on the Tables of her Memory Fairly transcrib'd and fastned every thing. There shin'd the total Apparition still, And all her Thoughts with Ravishment did fill. 187 With Ravishment, which proved fuel to Her ancient fire of Love: a Fire that now Flash'd resolutely out, and feasted so On this vast Banquet, which had leave to flow With fresh Infinitude upon it, that The Flames all bridles and all bounds forgot. 188 Like Wax which yields before the Summer's Sun; So in the presence of this scorching Heat Her Bowels melted, and her Heart did run About her Bosom, labouring to get Releasment from the Furnace: but in vain; Heav'n still to these sweet Torments her did chain. 189 Still she beheld what yet she might not see; Still there she walk'd whence she was snatch'd away; Her Eyes still feasted on Life's absent Tree; Still on the Crystal River's shore her stay She made, though on gross Earth she prostrate were, Being in sunder torn 'twixt Here and There. 190 In dainty Anguish thus she lay and fried, Till through her lips at last the Bonfire brake, And unto Phylax thus aloud she cryed: O why to Persecution's gentler stake Was I not bound; why might I not expire Amidst the bosom of that courteous Fire? 191 That Fire would soon have drunk up all my breath And into Ashes parch'd my Life; but This Plays with my Pangs, and freshly furnisheth My fainting Heart with passive Vigorousness: This, woful Immortality doth give To mouldering Dust, and teacheth Death to Live. 192 Nor Etna's nor Vesuvius's bowels were E'r gravid with such teeming Flames, as mine: Should Humber, Thames, and Severn, by thy care Their everflowing Mouths together join, And empty out their Torrents on my Heart, Alas they could not quench my burning Smart. 193 Flatter me not with vainly smiling Eye; Compassion is the utmost thou canst lend. He, He alone can cure my Malady Who plung'd me in this flaming Fever; and If Thou canst hasten down his Help, O do! Or tell me when He will conclude my Wo. 194 The Angel, who her blessed Sickness knew, Had now no longer power to pity her; But strait invisible, away he flew, That her Seraphick Pains might domineer; And she, thus left alone, might sooner prove The perfect Holocaust of generous Love. 195 When lo, her modest tender Jealousy Could not interpret his Discession so: She fear'd that by indecent Passion she Had wrong'd his Patience, and forc'd him to Withdraw; till troubled she grew calm again, And fit his Company to entertain. 196 This made her check her boiling Fervor by Deep Recollection of her Spouses's Will: She knockt her Breast, which made its first reply In Sighs, the next in these sad Words: O still This tumult of my Soul, dear Lord, whose heat Hath all my Bosom in combustion set. 197 I love the cause of my Destemper, yet Would fain more quietly disturbed be: I know my Torment can no Cure admit While I am Pris'ner to Mortality: Yet Thou canst find a way to make me dwell In Pain with Ease, with heav'nly Joy in Hell. 198 Although my long'd-for Union with Thee More precious is than thousand Lives; although Desire and Languor all my Essence be Till to Fruition of Thee I grow; Yet since thy Will prolongs my banishment From thy dear Sight, (peace Heart) I am Content. 199 I am Content: for all I am is Thine. The freedom of thy Pleasure use on Me; If I thine Arrows' smartest dint decline, Then say I lov'd my self, but lov'd not Thee: Pour on this Heart, pour all thine amorous Might And slay me if thou wilt, from Morn to Night. 200 But if I still must Live this Death, O may I live to Thee, my God, to Thee alone! O let some hard heroick Task allay The Fervor's edge, which thou hast set upon, My ravish'd Soul; that soundly busied, I May less resent the Flames in which I fry. 201 Shall I confront whate'r defyeth Thee? Shall I go check the Gallantry of Sin, And tell the boldest Crimes what Misery Waits at the desperate Goal to which they run? Shall I go sell my self, to ransome thy More worthy Servants from Captivity? 202 Shall I to Persecution's Court, and there Erect thy Standard in the Tyrant's face? Shall I her Racks, and Arts of Torture dare, And to the ground her Gods and Altars rase? Thy Majesty's Commands and Declarations, Shall I promulge against her Proclamations? 203 Shall all the Bruses, Wounds, Boyls, Ruptures, Pains, With every Grief, Distemper, and Mischance; Shall all the Hungers, Thirsts, and Stripes and Chains, Which always were the sure Inheritance Of Thine abused patient Members, join And domineer in this sole Corps of mine? 204 Shall I be made the Hate of Man and Beast? Shall I be scorn'd and kicked round about Th'insulting Universe? shall I be prest Down to the dismal ever-yelling Rout Of Feinds and Hags, and dragged through the Deep Where Horrors reign, and Torments never sleep? 205 This, this, and more, for thy all-precious sake Thy bounden Psyche surely could sustain: Speak then, O most deserving Sovereign speak, And by some suff'rings mitigate my Pain. Set me my hardy Task, that I may prove On any terms how much I love thy Love. 206 Thus panted loyal She: till tired by Her Fervor's high Intension, she descended Into her self again: but instantly That strong Combustion she hop'd was ended, Met her amidst her Breast; for new Desire Kindled afresh her most impatient Fire. 207 By Resignation to her Spouse she hasted Again to quench its Rage; yet day by day Her self she found in amorous Languor wasted, And waking night by night, and Longing lay: Or, when from place to place she hunted Rest, Her Torments' Spring still bore she in her Breast. 208 As Conscience's quick Book, which flyeth in Their guilty faces, who have stained it With hideous Blots of Mercy-daring Sin, Before their eyes doth armed Vengeance set, With Snakes, and Furies, Dread, and Desperation, And all Attendants of complete Damnation: 209 Thus, thus her restless Memory to her The beautious Wonders of her Dream objected, With all Beatitude's bright Furniture: In vain her eyes she studiously deflected, Which were in every corner crost by this Intrusion of strange importunate Bliss. 210 When to her Prayers she went, she could not Pray; Heav'n and Amazement strait were crowding in: When to her Book, alas, she could not say; Love's Languor stop'd her e'r she could begin: When to her Course of Psalms, she could not sing; Loud in her ears the Angels' Anthem rung. 211 When to her Meat she went, she could not Eat; The Tree of endless Life her thoughts took up: When to the Fountain of her Drink, the sweet River of Heav'n prov'd her tormenting Stop: When to her sleep, she was disturbed by The undisturb'd Rest of Eternity. 212 Oft she resolved with Content to wait Heav'n's leisure, till her Heart might thither sore; Yet her Resolves but mock'd themselves, for strait She found her Heart was settled there before: And still the more she check'd and downward bent Her Thoughts, the more she felt them upward rent. 213 The dear Remembrance of her Sovereign Lord Boil'd in her Soul, and would not slaked be: So that while tortur'd She could not afford Her Body what Recruits Necessity Crav'd at her hands; she faint and feeble grew, And by degrees her Mortal Self she slew. 214 She slew her Flesh, which pin'd and sunk away; She slew the Vigor of her Senses, which Like unbent Bows, all damp'd and useless lay: Yet by these Slaughters she did but inrich The Life of her afflicted Heart, which still Found out a way with stouter Fire to swell. 215 So high it swell'd, that whatsoe'r came near The raging Torrent, strait became its Prey: Yea ev'n the Bridles too subdued were, Which still she hop'd and strove on it to lay; Her Meditations all to Passions turned; And whatsoe'r she did, or Fancy'd; Burned. 216 Since Man receiv'd Capacity to be The Vassal of Diseases, He was ne'r In bondage to so deep a Malady As when imperious fiery Love doth bear The scepter of his Thoughts, and is possest Of all the Realm of his soft yielding Breast. 217 I know, alas, I know for certain, I Believed am by every genuine Heart Whose Tenderness hath been transfixed by The violence of Love's mysterious Dart. These, these will justify my Song, and be Condolers with my Psyche, and with Me. 218 Inamoration, be it of a Thing But weak and mortal, and Dust's wretched Heir; Can with immortal Pains and Wishes sting, And spur the Soul into unwearied Care; Doubts and Discouragements in vain lead up Their Troops of Obstacles its way to stop. 219 No, no: the generous Lover's Heart disdains Not to approve his Passion infinite: With gallant Obstinacy he maintains Against the Will of Heav'n and Earth the fight, To win his Idol; for whose sake, had He Millions of Lives, Millions should ventur'd be. 220 For in Her Image, which he hath inshrin'd High in the Temple of his loyal Breast, Such mighty Charms his zealous Fancies find As rob him of all Power to resist. On, on he runs; and in such furious wise, That Love is slandered with want of Eyes. 221 Knows not the World how Hamor's royal Son His Foreskin scorn'd and his Religion too, When Dinah's Love got full possession Of his subdued Soul? How David, who Was Heav'n's choise Darling, durst Heav'n's Law despise For what he read in Bathsheba's fair Eyes? 222 Who hath not heard what power one Helen had Upon two mighty Nations, both content, For love of Her to run so strangly mad Upon a War of Hate; whose Fury rent Up Ilium by the roots; which to the flame Of Lust a woful Holocaust became? 223 No marvel then the Fire of heav'nly Love With such intollerable Fervor reigns; Whose ravishing Sweetness is so far above All sublunary Charms; whose mystick Chains Draw with almighty Force, and cannot be Outvy'd by feeble Man's Reluctancy. 224 Sick, desperatly Sick is Psyche now, And finds no Physick to aswage her Pain: Did any Salve in furthest India grow, Through all the Seas she thither would amain: But Earth breeds no such Herb as can relieve The Wounds which Heav'n's inamoring Arrows give. 225 For all those Wounds bleed nothing else but Fire; Fire, which remembring its original Flame, With neverwearied strugling must aspire Back to the radiant Home from whence it came; Its proper Element are Jesus's Eyes, And thither in heroick Zeal it Flies. 226 And what can racked Psyche do, who by This most unruly Heat to Heav'n is haled; And yet by mortal Life's repugnancy Fast to her Body and dull Earth is sealed? What can she do in this Extremity Of raging Life and Death at once; but Cry? 227 Hardy and bold she grows in her Complaint: For lifting up her love-encourag'd eyes, Although her sickly Voice were low and faint, Yet full of sinews were her serious Cries: Which thus she suting to her flaming Passion, Tun'd by the stout Key of Expostulation: 228 O Lord of Gentleness, O why dost thou Make Love so cruel to tormented me? O Lord of Justice, canst thou me allow No other Torturer but Suavity? Why must my Gall be only Honey? why Of nothing else but Life must Psyche die? 229 Why didst thou not permit me to Decease When thou hadst left me to my Self alone? So had thine Handmaid been repriev'd from these Riddles of charming Pangs; so had I gone Whole to my grave, who now must Melted be By thine unsufferable sweets, and thee. 230 O might thy Presence but consume me, I Should drop into my Nothing with Delight, But thus to be dissolv'd and murder'd by Thine only Absence, duplicates the weight Of my strange Death, whilst in my killing woes I all the Pleasure of my Ruin loose. 231 And am I not a Worm, and worse than so? What Triumph then canst thou atchieve on me! Why dost thou not pick out some Seraph, who With this sublime and blessed Misery Might bravely grapple? or why mightst thou not At Phylax's nobler Breast my Dart have shot? 232 O be not angry! 'tis not I that speak, But tortured Necessity: my Heart A thousand times desir'd, but could not break; My Lips had not presumed else to part And ope into these bold Complaints; wherein Excuse (I hope) is woven with my Sin. 233 Not for innumerable Worlds would I Have miss'd that splendid Apparition: but Should full as many Worlds their Tyranny Combine against my Soul, they could not put Poor Me to any Torture so extream As this Remembrance of my blessed Dream. 234 Yet though in Ravishments thy Kingdom be So truly Sovereign: Psyche could forbear From reaching her ambitious Ardency To any glorious Joys which triumph there, Wert Thou away: but pardon, pardon Me If I profess I needs must Covet Thee. 235 In Sweetness why art thou so Infinite? Or why must that Infinitude appear To any Soul to fire her with Delight, If to the Front she may not come, and there Quench her impatient Thirst? O Jesu be Still what thou art; but then be so to Me! 236 Be so to Me; and O be so with speed! Death is not Death compared with Delay: This teacheth every Moment to excede All those long Years I till this cruel Day Have tediously measured; and now I older by an Age each Minute grow. 237 Fain fain would I let thee alone, and be Content to wait thy longest Leisure still: But O, all-lovely Thou now urgest me, And violently dragg'st my conquer'd Will. Thou dragg'st me; yet wilt not permit that I Should follow home to my Felicity. 238 If thou wilt kill me; lo thy Worm's content: But O, vouchsafe to let my slaughter be By Death, not by this breathing Banishment From my best Life, most ameable thee! O pity, pity thy poor Handmaid's Cry, Whose Tongue cleaves to her mouth, whose throat is dry. 239 Here hop'd she to have fainted: but her Pain Whose load so heavy on her shoulders lay, With cruel Kindness helped to sustain Her parched Vigor, that it still might prey Upon her Patience, and consume her still. O strange Disease which canst by Curing Kill! 240 Phylax mean while unseen, perceiv'd that she To Heav'n's fair Suburbs was arrived now; And that the Strings of her Mortality By this high stretch would quickly crack: for though Her Self her Change's Dawn could not descry, He saw her final Hour was drawing nigh. 241 His Love this roused timely to prepare For's precious Pupil's never-ending End: About her Funeral kind and decent Care He took; because himself could not attend Those Rites, when She had once Expir'd; for He Her noble Paranymphus was to be. 242 He was to be her Convoy when she flew Up to her royal Spouse's marriage Bed: This made him dress his Count'nance with a new Festivity; his Wings this made him spread With fresh and snowy Down, that's Master's Bride In that soft Coach of Triumph home might ride. 243 And in this joious Hue to her he came; Yet She his sweet Approach regarded not: For, burning in her more delicious Flame, The Sense of all things else she quite forgot. The Phenix thus, amidst her funeral Fires, Sees nothing else, and nothing else desires. 244 Flat on the ground, though wholly snatch'd from Earth, The most subdued Prize of Zeal she lay: Her tired Blood no longer sally'd forth, But to her Heart retreating back, gave way To overpowring Pallor's deadly Chase, Who strait set up his Colours in her face. 245 The double Fountain of her Tears was dry; Her Groans were tired; and her Languishment It self did languish: but her Ecstasy Outrageous grew, and like a Giant bent The mighty Bow of her Desires, by which The Mark of all her Hopes she was to reach. 246 To loathed Earth then having bid Adieu, And firmly fixt her loving longing Eye On her dear Heav'n, to keep her Aim in view; Her Flame's triumphant Tempest swell'd so high That She, unable to contain its Tide, With three deep sighs cry'd out O LOVE, and dy'd. ???? ???.

      <field name="fulltext">MINOR POEMS IN ENGLISH AND LATIN. POEMS On several Occasions. LOVE's Eye. I Bold Proverb! do not thus blaspheme: What, is Love blind? why, GOD is Love, And can'st thou Blindness charge on Him Who is all Eye? Do but remove False Prejudice, and thou shalt find 'Tis Passion, and not Love is blind. II Love's of so quick a sight, that He Aforehand with his Object is, And into dark Futurity With præsciential Rays doth press. How strange were Heav'n's fam'd Bliss, which lies In Vision, had Heav'n's King no Eyes! III Hast thou not heard how He set ope Those Eyelids into broad day sight, Which Nature's Seal had dammed up With a deep-lay'd annealed Night? And how can He in Blindness live Who, spite of Nature, Eyes can give? IV And wonder not that by a Clay, (The likeliest thing to close them up) He them unlock'd; this was the way His own Divinity to ope: A way which none but He could take, Who Man at first of Clay did make. V But if by Love thy meaning were Vain Cupid, I consent with thee; Blindness herself would never dare To count herself more blind than He: And justly He doth want his Sight, Who joys in none but Deeds of Night. The Oath. I Yes, As I live, I'll do't.—Nay stay My Friend, if that be all, I may Not rest on this Security; Your swearing by Your Life, doth but my Faith deter, For you but by a Vapour swear. II Your Life! what Lease makes Life your own? May not your flitting Breath be blown Away by every moment's Blast? Future, and past, Quite out of thy possession are, And present's gone as soon as here. III What mean'st thou then by As I Live? Death can thy Confidence deceive, And make thee dye a perjur'd Man Precisely when Thou'rt swearing by thy Life: Take heed, That Oath thy Essence doth exceed: IV An Oath, which only doth become The mighty Mouth of GOD, from whom Life learn'd to live.—Ah, mortal Wight, I sooner might Yield on thy Credit to rely, If thou but swearest, As I Dye! Eloquence. I To speak or write Things which dare meet the searching Light; Solid Discourses pois'd with fit Judgment, and trimm'd with handsome Wit; Sweet Numbers, which can Pleasure's Soul distill, And thro' the willing Heart their Conquests thrill; II Words tuned by The heavenly Sphere's high Melody; Which with Devotion's Musick ring, And the Creator's Glory sing; Words which with charming ravishment surprize, And all the Hearers' Souls imparadise; III Is brave, I grant: And yet no certain argument But he who thus doth speak or write May be a Brat of swarthy Night; Nor must we think to calculate the Men By the sole Horoscope of Tongue or Pen. IV The Hand which paints The Glories of sin-conquering Saints, And makes the Deaths of Martyrs able To breath fresh Life on a dead Table, Upon a wicked Arm too often grows: 'Tis them, and not himself the Painter draws. V That Man for me Not in whose Words, but Deeds I see Zeal's gallant Flames. I dare not found Substantial Worth upon a Sound: His only is the solid Excellence Of Rhetorick, whose Life's his Eloquence. Scripture Translated. I Of Babes in Christ is this your care, To let them dang'rous Weapons wear? What you esteem the safely-handled Word, Is sharper than a two-edg'd Sword: Must Children's fond Temerity With two-edg'd Tools intrusted be? II Yes, Sophister, with this they may: Altho' themselves with it they slay, Their Sacrifice gives Heav'n the best content, When they a broken Heart present: And only by this Sword they can Cut off their old condemned Man. III The sturdy Heretick it is, And not the tender Babe, whom this Weapon doth arm for Mischief: that wild Wight Under Hell's Dragon loves to fight: But Heaven's most gentle Lamb of all Meek harmless Babes, is General. IV And He doth by his own sweet might Teach them to weild this Sword aright. To God thou need'st not lend thy Caution thus, For fear his Gift prove dangerous: Thou may'st thy Preachers, but 'tis odd Methinks, for Man to silence God. V Yet if he will in Latin teach, He shall thy License have to preach, And Sermons he ad Clerum when he please May freely make. But have not these Lay simple Souls more need, good Sir, Than your learn'd Scholars, Him to hear? VI Come, come; 'twas ne'er Saint Peter's mind The Spirit's Sword should be confin'd, And under his Keys locked up: 'tis you Who in your Latin Scabbard now Keep it so close, I more than fear That Rust, at least, it gathers there. VII Then draw it out, for shame, and let Careful Translations furbish it: The oft'ner thus you draw it, you will see It brighter, and more genuine be. Draw, draw; if not for Laymen, yet For your own Priests it may be fit. Life's Uncertainty. I What ail'st thou, to complain of what Thy Heart believeth not? Why cry'st thou out on Life's Uncertainty, And yet preparest not to dye? Either thy Mock-Repinings spare, Or else be true to thine own Fear. II Yet let me tell thee, hadst thou wise And right-discerning Eyes, Thou might'st an advantageous Courtesy In Life's Uncertainty espy, And ground to thank thy Lord, that he Let it not out by Lease to thee. III This was the way Love did contrive To make thee truly live Before thou dy'st, and after thou art dead: The only way thy Heart to lead On in devout religious Care, And holy profitable Fear. IV Thy brittle Life's Inconstancy Alarms thee constantly To stand upon thy never-sleeping guard, And Night and Day keep watch and ward: By which strict Discipline may'st thou In thy Lord's service perfect grow. V So wilt thou suffer no sly Sin Thy hold to undermine; So shalt thou sift by wise Examination The bottom of each fair Temptation: For Spies Temptations are, and sent To murder thee in compliment. VI Wert thou for any term secure That this Life should endure, Alas, how eas'ly would'st thou yield to set Up all thy Rest and Joys in it! And never strive that Life to gain, Which shall for evermore remain. VII But now be brave, and throw disdain On what thou find'st so vain. Is not thy Soul eternal? and can she On this short Vapour doating be? A Vapour, which each minute may Break, toss, and mock, and puff away! S. PETER'S Cock. I With what indiff'rence read I how The Cock did by his signal Crow Alarm Saint Peter's Heart! No Echo in my Breast I felt, Into the thought of my own Guilt To make my Conscience start. II But ah! sweet Lord of Lenity, Have not ungrateful faithless I Deny'd Thee more than thrice? And has the Cock not warned me To think of both myself and Thee By crowing more than twice? III Should all my Life be brought to trial, It would appear but a Denial Of what I owe to Thee: Yet no such terrible Temptation As Peter's was, e'er made invasion Upon my Loyalty. IV Alas! the Cock, who by his Crow Doth terror upon Lions throw, Hath never frighted me: I bolder am than they, for I Tho' but a Worm, have dared thy Almighty Majesty. V Sweet Jesu, it must be the Art Of Love, which seizeth this my Heart With penitent pious Fear: Soft Strokes will steal themselves into The Flint of that hard Soul, which no Fierce Violence can tear. VI O turn to me thy gracious Eye, And with its dear Artillery Shoot, shoot my Bosom thro'; My Heart, tho' deaf unto the stroke Of Sound, may learn to hear a Look, And broken, Weeper grow. VII Thy blessed Look knows how to speak Louder than any Voice, and shake The sturdiest Heart asunder: For in the radiant Treasury, Great Lord, of thy Soul-conquering Eye, Both Lightning dwells and Thunder. The Master. S. Matth. 11. 29. I Would thy Ambition paint thy Story With Learning's never-fading Glory? Thy aim is brave and high, If thou thy Master warily Dost choose; for such a choice, to thee Will half the way to Learning be. II Looks thy Election now about To find some Man or other out, Whom Wisdom's Fame doth crown? Take heed: for Error's plainly grown So epidemical, that she Becomes an human Property. III Look higher then; thine Eye advance Above that Cloud of Ignorance Which blinds this World below: Hark how the heav'nly Master now His Scholars woo's;—Come all, says he, Who would be learn'd, and Learn of Me. IV Who would not learn of Him? and yet How few Disciples does he get! All Oracles are dumb But His; and yet how slow we come To only Him! how fondly we Fain would, yet would not learned be! V For Knowledge still doth tempt us all, Nor fell we by our fatal Fall From that Ambition, which For the forbidden Fruit did itch: But now true Knowledge on no Tree Can grow, but that which once bare Thee. The Lesson. ibid. I What Lesson reads Heav'n's Master now Is't not too high for Worms below? Can most immeasurable He Shroud in our scant capacity? Does not the very plainest Alphabet Of Heav'nly Wisdom pose our quickest Wit? II Know then, that tho' He Sovereign be In Wisdom's glorious Monarchy; He's so in Mercy's too, and can Stoop to the lowest Form of Man. He who himself unto the Cross did bow, Will not disdain to teach true Wisdom now. III Witness his easy Lesson, which Tho' Heav'nly, doth no higher reach Than Lowliness: and who is he Who here can want Capacity? Descent's Earth's natural Motion, and how Can it be hard for Sons of Clay to bow? IV Come learn of Me, for meek am I And lowly, cryeth the Most High. Ne'er didst thou in Lyceum, ne'er In the grave Porch this Lesson hear; The lofty Academy ne'er could reach So high as this most lowly Lesson's pitch. V O study then with all thy Art This Lesson how to get by Heart: By Heart, by Heart it must be got, And not upon thy outside float. Meekness is then right built, when thou canst find Her Ground-work in the bottom of thy Mind. Anger. I My Friend, run quickly to thy Glass, And read thy Cure in thine own Face. Why should the Scorpion be The readiest Remedy For his own Poison, and not thou? Apply, apply; 'twill do, I know. II See what black Clouds thy Brow deform With grim Threats of th'approaching Storm! Lo! how thy pallid Cheek And trembling Lips do seek To make thee understand, how thou Art posting to self-torture now! III Look how thy working troubled Eye In its own Fire doth strangely fry! What Frowns plow up the grace Of thy disturbed Face, Preventing Time, and making thee In one hour old and wrinkled be! IV On mine rely not, but receive The Warning that thyself do'st give: Did'st ever view a Sight Fuller of ugly Fright? Be calmer then, in mercy to Thy tortur'd self, tho' not thy Foe. The Times. I Why slander we the Times? What Crimes Have Days and Years, that we Thus charge on them Iniquity? If we would rightly scan, 'Tis not the Times are bad, but Man. II Constant Obedience they Do pay To their great Maker; and Do we do so? Nay, never stand To study Shifts; 'tis plain 'Tis our Blot which the Times doth stain. III If thy Desire it be To see The Times prove good, be thou But such thyself, and surely know That all thy Days to thee Shall, spite of Mischief, happy be. The Rich Scorner. S. Luke 16. 21. I What? shall thy Dogs more courteous Be, than thyself, to Lazarus? Shall their Tongues court his Sores, and thine mean while His Misery revile? Strange Metamorphosis! which thus doth make The Master strive to bark, the Dogs to speak. II Take heed: the Play may soon be done: For in Life's Comedy not one Of all the Acts but well may be the last. O do but then forecast What thy high Part will prove, when thou shalt be Quite level'd by the just Catastrophe. III May not thine Exit follow'd be With hellish Hissings? May not he His Plaudit find clap'd by fair Angels' Wings? Come, come, great Sir, these things Are not vain Fancy's Froth; Life, tho' it be A Play, will prove a real History. Home. I Home's Home, altho' it reached be Thro' Wet and Dirt and Night; tho' heartily I welcom'd was, yet something still, Methinks, was wanting to fulfil Content's odd Appetite: no cheer, Say I, so good as that which meets me here, II Here, here at Home: Not that my Board I find with quainter, richer Dainties stor'd; No, my high Welcome all in this Cheap simple Word presented is, My Home; a Word so dearly sweet, That all Variety in it I meet. III When I'm abroad, my Joys are so, And therefore they to me seem Strangers too: I may salute them lovingly, But must not too familiar be; Some ceremonious Points there are Which me from Pleasure's careless Freedom bar. IV There must my Mirth's Tunes taken be Not by mine own, but by my Convive's Key: My Words and Smiles must temporize, And I myself a Sacrifice Must on that Humour's Altar yield, Which there the Company shall please to build. V If there on every Dish I tast, 'Tis not myself, but some Disease I feast; My Friend suspects if I forbear, That I neglect him and his Cheer: Nor is it easy to prevent Or mine own Mischief, or his Discontent. VI But Home, sweet Home, releaseth me From anxious Joys, into the Liberty Of unsollicitous Delight; Which howsoever mean and slight By being absolutely free Enthrones me in Contentment's Monarchy.
