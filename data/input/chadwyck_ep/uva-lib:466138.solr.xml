      <field name="fulltext">POLITICAL VERSE LAPUTA OUTDONE. Oh, Philosopher crazed from the Island of Crazes, Explored and depicted by Jonathan Swift, Let us hear what your judgments on us and our ways is— Permit us your mental impressions to sift. For we have our follies of wisdom fantastic, Some high-philosophic, political some, And would fain ascertain, in no spirit sarcastic, If you, my dear pundit, can match them at home. When a man in Laputa falls sick unto danger, Then is it the rule in that singular place To throw up the window and ask the first stranger To kindly come in and prescribe on the case? When in legal perplexities, slighter or deeper, For counsel in law a Laputan applies, Does he seek the next crossing and beg of its sweeper, When business is done, to step round and advise? Are your pilots' certificates commonly given To men who have not even looked on the seas? Are your coachmen selected for not having driven? Say, have you Laputans got customs like these? You haven't? Then off with your bee-bearing bonnet, Illustrious guest from Luggnaggian shores! And down on your knee and do homage upon it Profound to a State that is madder than yours! For though we select not attorney, physician, Or pilot who steers us, or coachman who drives, From the ignorant crowd, who would gain erudition At risk of our fortunes, our limbs, or our lives; Yet this Ignorance dense that we do not let lead us In private concerns, lest disaster befall, This, that may not make wills for us, dose us, or bleed us May rule us—the business that's hardest of all! We say to It “Courage! Nay, go not so shyly! In time you will master the work you are at; Your country presents you her own corpus vile, See, here is the commonweal, practise on that! “Away with the notion (we echo in chorus) Of power withheld until knowledge be gained,” (Too long, cry the carts, have the horses before us Unjust and unworthy precedence obtained!) “The use of the scalpel in surgical functions Will give you the skill of a surgeon professed, And by much engine-driving at intricate junctions One learns to drive engines along with the best.” For is it not thus our political preachers Discourse to us daily, in bidding us note That “the franchise itself is the truest of teachers,” That “voting instructs in the use of the vote”? So, off with it! Off with your bee-bearing bonnet, Illustrious guest from Luggnaggian shores! And down on your knee, and do homage upon it Profound to a State that is madder than yours! THE BARON DE WIGG. All ye who sit waiting in moody array, Oppositionists eager to welcome a day With the fate of the Ministry big, Chastise your passion for power and place By recalling the sad but instructive case Of the fine old Baron de Wigg. Old Baron de Wigg from his earliest years Had moved in the highest official spheres, Until he had learnt to dream That “placemen” and “Wiggs” were convertible terms, And belonged to a system of which the germs Formed part of the cosmic scheme. He considered the ends of creation gained On the whole, while De Wiggs high office retained, Fulfilment complete being won When the head of the house was the realm's chief guide, And each of the other De Wiggs supplied With a post for a younger son. Now imagine the Baron de Wigg's disgust At finding the family suddenly thrust From their natural place in the State By men who from '32 down to that hour Had never enjoyed a spell of power Of more than the briefest date. But as year after year kept slipping away, To disgust there began a profound dismay In the Baron's breast to succeed; For, if longer excluded from place, he saw That the uniform order of physical law Could hardly be guaranteed. This gloomy conviction inclined him to lend Too willing an ear to a dubious friend (Mr Latterday Radd was his name), Who offered the Baron his counsel and aid To regain what was worthy the prize to be made Of a slightly unscrupulous game. But Latterday Radd two acquaintances had, Who rejoiced in the names of Crotchett and Fadd— A quite unpresentable pair; And the Baron, who could not afford to contemn An alliance with Radd, thought mixing with them To be—well, quite another affair. So when in pure zeal for De Wigg and his ends, Radd promised to drop his unsavoury friends (To “sink” was the word he employed), The Baron was touched by the simple young man Who such loyalty showed to himself and his clan, And accepted his aid overjoyed. And all the De Wiggs were effusive in praise Of the truly high-minded magnanimous ways Of good Mr Latterday Radd, And the disinterested effacement of self With which their consent to be laid on the shelf Had credited Crotchett and Fadd. By the help of the friend enlisted so (The while his associates shy “lay low,” According to pledge and resolve) The De Wiggs regained their official berth, And the planets returned to their paths, and the earth Began once more to revolve. But his conquest of place was no sooner achieved Than the Baron next day to his horror perceived— Arm-linked with Latterday Radd— That obtrusive old Crotchett pervading the place, And behind them the pert and self-satisfied face Of the still more odious Fadd. De Wigg would have cut them and hurried away, But Radd was before him, and hastened to say In a coldly imperious tone: “Permit me, dear Baron—(don't try to look big): Mr Fadd, Mr Crotchett—the Baron de Wigg, The friends of your friend are your own.” On the Baron expressing in manner constrained Surprise at their presence, his friend explained That his pledge had been misunderstood; For a time—and a purpose—he said, 'twas true, He had promised to “sink” the obnoxious two, But never to sink them for good. De Wigg having risen they too must rise, And he, as a friend, would the Baron advise To be civil to Crotchett and Fadd; So the Baron shook hands with a ghastly smile, For he fully admitted the need, for a while, Of, at least, being civil to Radd. Thus lancés and thus influentially backed, The pair to this wretched old party are tacked, And declare, on advancement intent, That he must introduce them without more ado In both the great Houses he's access unto; And the Baron will have to consent. All ye, then, who sit in impatient array, Oppositionists eager to welcome a day With the fate of the Ministry big, Chastise your passion for power and place By recalling the sad but instructive case Of the fine old Baron de Wigg. BALLAD OF BALOONATICS CRANIOCRACS. Of all the accomplished Professors who ever From learning contrived common-sense to dissever— Of all who delight, on a question of tongue, To foment agitation the peoples among— None goes with such thoroughness into the thing As the erudite Slav whose proceedings I sing; And whose name—if your jaws I may venture to tax— Is Professor Baloonatics Craniocracs. International law has his sovereign contempt; From restraints of political prudence exempt, He holds that when races for union clamour, The question's but one of comparative grammar. No “national movement,” whatever its fruits, That starts from a real relation of roots, The strenuous aid and encouragement lacks Of the famous philologist, Craniocracs. To many a cause of the “national” sort The Professor has lent his enlightened support; But of all his distinctions, his pride was to be a High priest of the Pan-Macaronic Idea, And first to have raised the Spaghettian claim To inherit the true Macaronian name: A position sustained against many attacks By Professor Baloonatics Craniocracs. The Spaghetts had been living in decent content, a Race subject for centuries past to Polenta, With liberties local and customs respected, And lenient taxes with justice collected, And ample permission their children to teach That poetic and grandly cacophonous speech Which first to their true nationality's tracks Had directed Baloonatics Craniocracs. But they, when he set their ethnology right, With the free Macaronians burned to unite: And the worthy Professor went round through their cities Establishing Pan-Macaronic Committees, Until they rebelled in a war to the knife, And after two years of the bloodiest strife, Forced haughty Polenta her grasp to relax, To the joy of their champion Craniocracs. From this struggle the rise of the Union dates Of the Pan-Macaronic Confederate States, Which, besides the Spaghetts, of a kindred as true Raviolians counts and Lasagnians too. But above them the Pateditalians claim A supremacy, due to generical name; And their claim the Professor unswervingly backs, For philologist always is Craniocracs. Are the freed populations content with their lot? Well, candour compels me to say they are not. Already the Union is deeply in debt And taxed to the skin is the wretched Spaghett. And the Pateditalians forbid him to teach His poetic and grandly cacophonous speech, On the ground that of modern corruption it smacks— As is even admitted by Craniocracs. But the worst of it is (if the murder must out), The Professor's researches have led him to doubt If his first ethnologic conclusions were sound, Since he, as it seems, a new “factor” has found, The “Vermicellenic,” so named from a race Whose affinities throw a new light on the case; Transforming, indeed, into whites all its blacks To the mind of Baloonatics Craniocracs. Through the Vermicellenes the Spaghett and his brother, Are clearly of kin to Polenta and other Great nations; and though they could only unite By involving the world in a general fight, The Professor, intrepid of logic as ever, Will work day and night at that noble endeavour. All hobbies are wild, but the wildest of hacks Is bestrid by Baloonatics Craniocracs. AN ENFANT TERRIBLE. I. The baby was born on a lowering morn In Seventeen Eighty-and-Nine, And poets and sages enacted the Mages Who hailed the event divine. Their “star in the west” had, it must be confessed, A slightly sulphureous gleam; But it faithfully led to the tumble-down shed, At the sign of “The Old Régime.” The adorers brought of the gold of Thought, And the myrrh and frankincense of Song; And they worshipped the birth that redeemed the earth From the Old Dispensation of wrong. With each other they vied for the pleasure and pride Of preparing the Prince's crown, And every one smiled on the infant mild Till he kicked—and the house fell down. II. Then the poets and sages who acted as Mages Went home to consider the scene, And with serious looks sat them down to their books To resolve what this portent should mean. And when they had found upon reasoning sound What the strange new thing must be, They compared their notes, and collected the votes, And it seemed that they couldn't agree. Some courageously said a mistake had been made, That the good they had worshipped was evil, Their Saviour supposed, by his conduct disclosed For an obvious limb of the Devil. But others demurred to this view, and preferred A conclusion less humbling to pride, And admitting the child to be wayward and wild, His Satanic extraction denied. 'Twas (they said) premature to affect to be sure How a babe later on will behave, And for all that the boy had begun to destroy, It might well be his mission to save. III. But to common surprise, while disputed the wise, Was the infant inspired or mad, To boyhood 'twas reared, and it shortly appeared That the world was too small for the lad. He had got him a blade at Ajaccio made, And had picked up a song at Marseilles, And had rigged up a flag from a three-coloured rag He had fixed to its staff—with nails. A bonnet of red he had cocked on his head, Steel-bright were his eyes, and wild; Unkempt was his hair, and his legs were bare— A truly unusual child! IV. So sallied he forth, East, South, and North, To the barren lands and the fair; To the South in its glows, to the North in its snows, To the East in its desert-glare. To the Elbe, to the Rhine, through the plumed Apennine, Over Italy's plains he hastes; Then Eastward far—till his conquering star Grew dim on the Syrian wastes: To the shores of the Nile; to the Knights' old isle; Then again by the pierced Pyrenees, South, south, ever south, to the Mid-sea's mouth, At the Pillars of Hercules. East, North, and South, as a flood to its mouth Bears trees of the forest uptorn, On the towering crest of the wave in his breast Was the terrible urchin borne. With the spilth of his hands he slaked the sands Athirst of Egyptian suns; He scarred the scalp of the frozen Alp With the wheels of his clambering guns. Sank hearts of kings when rustled the wings Of his eagles about their ears; At his cannon-knell old empires fell, And thrones of a thousand years. All wisdom of time, all strength of prime, At the foot of this stripling crude, With his head in a blaze of its single craze, Lay stupefied, spent, subdued! V. And the doctors? Well, if the truth be to tell, Even some in opinion stout, Who had clung to the creed that the child was indeed A Messiah, began to doubt. But the sturdiest ones still stuck to their guns, And maintained his legation divine; “Not peace, but a sword,” was the scriptural word, From which he had taken his line. Then the kings he o'erthrew had had only their due, And might even a punishment worse Have deservedly got for a certain vile plot, To strangle the baby at nurse. VI. Thus the doctors cried; but the world outside, That life, not books, understands— The Great Commonplace—had already the case Withdrawn from the doctors' hands. To the men of the field and the mart was revealed, Through a mist of conceptions vague, One truth, clear as light, that, cost what it might, They must promptly abate this plague. So the nations clubbed, that the boy might be drubbed; While he, with unwavering mind, Stood, a new Athanase—would the whole world face For a creed—of a different kind. He fought hard and hot, and with varying lot, And with hopes now high, now low, Till a certain forenoon, in the month of June, When he closed with his strongest foe. They closed, and the shock made Europe to rock, And the pulse of her heart to stay, While the wrestlers gasped, in their death-grip clasped, For all one breathless day. But his glass was run; sank, sank with the sun The line of its lessening sand, And as night came down he was prostrate thrown, And the great sword torn from his hand. This, safe under lock, on a sea-girt rock They hid; and it six years lay Condemned to rust in the island dust, Till it rusted its heart away. While as for the boy who had wrought such annoy To the world in his youthful fling, Of his ways to repent, straight home he was sent In charge of a Christian King. They tore down his rag of a tricolor flag, And they gave him a banner instead, Of a beautiful white, with lilies bedight, And gold for the blue and the red. They put him to school of the good priests' rule, To atone by penance and praise And prostration of soul for his Carmagnole, And mass for his Marseillaise. VII. In this excellent way (so the doctors say) Was the scapegrace led to reform; And a grave middle age, respected and sage, Has succeeded his youth of storm. And (excepting, perhaps, one unlucky relapse From his later regenerate state, Into juvenile ways on the great Three Days, And another in 'forty-eight, And a third—worst far—at the end of the War) He has yearly become more staid; More and more like that other, his English brother, Who's fat, and has taken to trade. And though, here and there, some devil-may-care Of a Russ or a Bursch by the Spree May claim him as kin, they will shortly begin Oats sown, to reform, just as he. VIII. Thus the doctors declare with their confident air; But many there be who avow That, for all they have seen of thy altered mien, O Democracy, dread art thou! If their fancy essay thy form to portray, In the vision that faces them then, No shape they behold of the stature and mould Of a man among mortal men. But rather in thought is thy emblem wrought Mysterious, formless, vast; A giant of stone on a giant throne, Like the gods of the long-buried past. Yet about thy feet light chatterers meet, Politician and pamphleteer, And they learnedly prose on the form of thy toes Or the toe which may chance to be near. Not caring to raise their complacent gaze So high that a glance may fall On the hands laid at ease o'er the monstrous knees— Those hands which could cover us all! Not caring to trace on the stone-hewn face, With its distance-questioning eyes, That inscrutable smile of the Head by the Nile That is dumb till the sun shall rise. When its first rays smite, what chord of affright Will it sound for the world's new song? What ground-tone of fear?—Who lives, he shall hear: May he not have lived too long! THE REGION OF DREAM. In a legend of old 'tis recorded for us That the air and the sea and the land To the children of man were distributed thus By Zeus his apportioning hand: He appointed the land for the Workers to share, And the sea for the Poet to roam, But assigned in his wisdom the vacuous air For the Higher Philosopher's home. “Go wander,” said Zeus to this last (we were taught), “Where alone there is room for your schemes, In a region as wide as the reach of your thought, And as lofty—and void—as your dreams. “Here is food for your mind, for your body a feast Of the which never dearth can befall, Ay, a plenty of nourishing wind from the East To fill you your belly withal. “From the clouds you may gather your theory-stuff, Definitions from tracks of the birds, Here are mists in abundance and more than enough For becomingly clothing your words. “Here perform at your leisure the feats that you love Unrestrained by conditions of place, And leap from the plane where your premisses move To conclusions in Infinite Space. “I will give you, to deck your magnificent views, The run of the rainbow-span, And allow you the pick of the sunset hues To adorn your ‘Future-of-Man,’” Thus Zeus, in the legend, ordained it, and hence Mankind have been wont to declare Of all Theory freed from the trammels of sense, That its natural home is the air. But now would you know the Chimera's abode, And the kingdom of Folly Supreme? Would you seek, in these days, to discover the road To the genuine region of dream? It is not in the vacuous air, it is not In the wandering clouds, wind-blown. The region of dream is the three-acre plot Where an Irishman's “praties” are sown. It is here where the eye philosophic detects The suspension of natural laws; Where causes omit to engender effects And effects can dispense with a cause. It is here where the marvels of magical spell Medieval find credit once more, And “peasant-proprietor” conjures as well As an “Abracadabra” of yore. It is here, it is here, on the Irishman's farm Where alchemic economists hold That to utter the “peasant-proprietor” charm Transmutes the base metals to gold, That by force of this sorcery Waste becomes Thrift And energy springs out of Sloth, That the burden of Need reappears as a gift And exhaustion of soil as a growth. Ah! bodiless, limitless regions of space! What dream have you brought to the birth So fantastic as this whose nativity-place Is the solid, dull, definite earth?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OCCASIONAL RHYMES HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. (Brighton. 1881.) Scene—A Railway Platform. Policemen assembled. To them an Inspector: they exchange greetings. He sings, accompanying himself softly on the Rattle. Inspector. Heed not, comrades, though they taunt us With the Frenchman's subtler art; 'Tis a prouder boast to vaunt us In the wisdom of the heart. Be it ours—we much prefer it— To survey men's works and ways In a nobler, kindlier spirit, With a franker, freer gaze. Higher heights of moral stature Presuppose a wider glance; Let us trust in human nature, “Honi soit qui mal y pense.” Doubt, we know, is from the devil, Let us thrust its lures aside; Constables who think no evil Ever have been England's pride. All (enthusiastically). Ay! away with base suspicion, And with thoughts that wrong mankind! Ill it were in our position To indulge a cynic mind. (A train enters the station. They approach it.) Inspector. See from yonder railway carriage Who is this emerging, pray, In a plight 'twould scarce disparage To describe as disarray? Why! his face and hands are gory, And exhausted he appears! Stranger, pour your moving story In our sympathetic ears. (He pours it.) All. Ah, most startling! Ah, most thrilling! Of romance 'tis strangely full! Aged merchant—missing villain— Countryman—and cock-and-bull! Inspector (after a pause). Yet I fain would ask you, stranger, How—but, no, this will not do; Mutual trust it might endanger— Who am I to question you? All (approvingly). Who, indeed? Avaunt, suspicion! Down, ye thoughts that wrong mankind! Ill befits it our position To indulge a cynic mind. (Another pause, during which they eye the stranger closely.) Inspector (after a struggle with himself). Pardon, Sir, the strong desire I Vainly labour to restrain; But th' old Adam of inquiry Rises in my breast again. Tell me (thus a weakness lingers!) How and when you tore your coat; And are those not marks of fingers That I see upon your throat? Where's your collar? where your necktie? Where—but why the question press? If your mens be conscia recti What's a collar more or less? All. What, indeed? Away, suspicion! Get thee, Satan's child, behind! Let us each in his position Shun that curse—a cynic mind. (Yet another pause. They still continue eyeing the stranger.) Inspector (diffidently). I despise the art of angling For disclosures—mean pursuit! But . . . . I notice something dangling (Not a bootlace) from your boot. Ha! a watch-chain! I declare, it Seems a funny place to—eh? What! “The way you always wear it?” Say no more! forgive me, pray! True-born Britons never heed 'em, Casual trifles such as these; Heirs to centuries of freedom Wear their watch-chains how they please. All (proudly). True! Away then, vile suspicion! Spurn we thoughts that wrong mankind! Base it were in our position To indulge a cynic mind. Inspector. Now farewell! the word may grieve us Yet at last we must dismiss Dearest friends; but ere you leave us Gentle stranger, tell me this: Since we may your kind assistance Need to trace this dreadful crime— Are you going any distance? Or for any length of time? “Just a week of foreign travel?” Thanks! Then we may count on you After that to help unravel This dark mystery! Adieu! (Stranger embraces the police, beginning with the Inspector; then enters a Continental train. They watch it moving from the station until it is lost to view.) Inspector and Chorus. Speed thee, speed thee, o'er the billow! I will not believe thee vile. We will not believe thee vile. Smooth, O smooth is strewn the pillow Under heads that know no guile. Doubt, I feel, is from the devil; Doubt, We feel, is from the devil; I will thrust its lures aside. Let us thrust its lures aside. Constables that think no evil Ever have been England's pride. FROM AN IRISH LETTER-BAG. (1880.) Dear Frank, I have read with profound admiration The eloquent speeches you lately have made, And applaud in especial that noble oration Directed at landlords who wish to be paid. You denounce with the force of invincible reason Those merciless men who their tenantry press, And who thus in the present deplorable season Attempt to make capital out of distress. Of the part that I took at the recent election To aid your return I have cause to be proud; So believe me, dear Frank, with the truest affection, Yours ever admiringly, Dicky O'Dowd. Dear Dick, For the friendly and cousinly spirit Displayed in your letter its writer I thank; Of landlords like you the approval to merit Is more than enough for yours heartily, Frank. Dear Frank, I have no hesitation in tasking The kindness of one so large-hearted as you, And I therefore address you with confidence, asking Your leave for delaying a payment that's due. As from now till a year from the coming December The rent of my farms I must wholly abate, You will hardly expect me till then to remember Your charge on the Ballymahoony estate. Hard pressed as I am, it would greatly relieve me, This eighteen months' grace if I might be allowed; So, assuming your friendly forbearance, believe me, Your cousin affectionate, Dicky O'Dowd. Dear Dick, I assure you it pains me intensely Your modest request to be forced to refuse; But though to assent would rejoice me immensely, I'm really in no situation to choose. To postpone to one's children relations more distant Is surely a maxim you wouldn't condemn; And my family, Dick! 'twould be scarcely consistent With what I regard as my duty to them. Then forgive me, old boy, that the claims of my wife and My brats before yours—even yours—I must rank; So heartily wishing you health and long life and A bumper next harvest, yours lovingly, Frank. Dear Frank, I'm aware of my “once removed” cousins, But I, recollect, am a “father of five,” While my tenants, alas! can display them in dozens, A-swarm in their cabins like bees in a hive. Tim Doolan, with eight, hasn't found it convenient To pay me a farthing for two years and more; And, in spite of my five, I'm obliged to be lenient, So, you, too, might manage it, Frank, with your four. I think we should help one another to bear it— This burden by which the whole country is bowed; And I cannot but think you are ready to share it With yours very faithfully, Dicky O'Dowd. Dear Dick, You behaved with a wise moderation, I own, when your claim on Tim Doolan you sank; But I cannot perceive that a like obligation Devolves upon yours very faithfully, Frank. Dear Frank, Can't you really? 'Tis I then who labour Beneath moral-optic illusions alone. But I know that the judge of the case of a neighbour Is mighty astute to “distinguish” his own. Yet allow me to say, your humanity-preachings Might well be a little less eager and loud While you throw the expense of applying its teachings On yours unassistedly, Dicky O'Dowd. Sir, I beg to acknowledge your insolent letter, But care not its sophistries cheap to expose; I'm content to remark that I think it is better That this correspondence between us should close. If you cannot perceive the disparity glaring Between the two cases you seek to confuse, I must leave you alone with your blunder, despairing Of bringing you round to more sensible views. But though I shan't waste my own labour in writing, To try and point out the mistake you have made, I may, by a letter my lawyer's inditing, Convince you, perhaps, that I mean to be paid. I want but my money, and do not intend it Grabbed up by a covetous landlord to be, So a cheque if you please, and the sooner you send it The better you'll satisfy F. H. O'D. Sir, Take and be—happy, the sum that I owe you, The slice from your debtor, you Shylock avowed! It is something at least and at last that I know you. Your luckless Antonio, Richard O'Dowd. Post scriptum.—I erred, and I own it with candour, In thinking, misled by analogy loose, To apply to the humanitarian gander Your sauce for the landed-proprietor goose. THE PUZZLED HISTORIAN. (1880.) “What is the drift of it? Where is the key to it? Fog and perplexity! What does it mean? Search as I may, no solution I see to it, Nowhere the trace of a clue to be seen.” Such is the cry the South African mystery, Wrapt as 'twill seem in obscurity dense, Surely will draw from the writer of history, Sifting the matter a century hence. “Come now, together once more let me pull myself,” Thus will he mutter with resolute frown; “Else I shall think I am growing as dull myself, Dull as the Blue-books I have to boil down. “Yes! it is clear that a certain Commissioner Occupied (let me be sure of the year— Seventy-nine) at the Cape the position or Office of ruler—that's perfectly clear. “Clear it is too (for a scrutiny rigorous Settles the point) that Commissioner Frere Does, for proceedings imprudently vigorous, Get himself wigged by the Government here. “Wigged with asperity, wigged with severity (Whigs cannot wig as Conservatives can); So that one thinks he'll resign with celerity Such as becomes a high-spirited man. “Ah! but he doesn't; that's quite incontestable; Clearly, yes clearly, he doesn't resign: Swallows his wigging and finds it digestible, Sticks to his office through Seventy-nine. “What have we then? Why, a furious clamour and Angry demands for Sir Bartle's recall; Gladstone—the Gladstone—attacking him hammer and Tongs, and protesting the loudest of all! “Levity, rashness, inordinate vanity, Chauvinist arrogance, stubborn self-will, Callous contempt for the claims of humanity— Such were the terms of which Frere had his fill. “Faults intellectual, moral obliquities, Shared, it was said, the Commissioner's mind; ‘Wildest of follies’ or ‘worst of iniquities’ Equally truly his action defined. “Thus we go on until changes political Bring to a close the Conservative reign, Placing this Gladstone—the closest of critical Study assures me—in office again. “Now then, I thought, 'twill all up with Sir Bartle be, Gladstone will have him back home pretty soon; Or he may think his more dignified part'll be That of the Colonel's intelligent 'coon. “No, not a bit of it! quite the reverse of it; Colonel and 'coon get on capital terms; Federal scheme is revived, and, as nurse of it, Frere in his office the Premier confirms. “Frere, the atrocious, the quite indefensible; Maker of barbarous wars has become Frere, the sagacious, the quite indispensable Man of the policy favoured at home. “Wonders on wonders! but by this addition or Rather completion the summit is topped; Frere, the forgiven and trusted Commissioner, Shortly discovers his salary stopped! “Surely a body of fables incredible Gathering round this Commissioner Frere! One I could swallow, or two might be edible, Hardly the whole—in a single career. “Wigged by Conservative chiefs who appointed him, Cursed—and conserved by the Whigs who attacked! Feathered and tarred by the priests who anointed him, Whitewashed by those at whose hands he was blacked! “Sternly rebuked—and with signal humility Bowing his head and consenting to stay! Fiercely reviled—and retained for ability! Highly commended—and docked of his pay! “Have I as one two Commissioners reckoned, or Is there a brace of Prime Ministers here? Are there two Gladstones, a first and a second, or Is there, perchance, an alternative Frere? “Vainly, ah vainly, I strive with the mystery; Vainly I hunt for the clue that I miss; Fog and perplexity! Who would the history Wish to compose of a people like this?” “OUR GLYCERINE BAROMETER.” (1880.) The violent storm which is still raging around us has come opportunely to illustrate the significance of the records which we commenced publishing on Monday of the readings of the Jordan Glycerine Barometer recently established at this office.—The Times, Oct. 29. Scene.—Editorial Room in Printing-House Square. The Editor of the ‘Times’ discovered seated at a table. A storm is raging. To him enters a Sub-Editor. Recitative. Sub-Editor. How fiercely chides the storm without, How howl the winds in devil's din! And see with news of rack and rout What telegrams come pouring in! From Falmouth to the Firth of Tay Our sea-lashed coasts with wrecks are strewn, Wind-hunted ships crowd every bay. Ed. God bless my soul! how opportune! Sub-E. From east to west, from north to south, The floods are out for miles and miles; From watershed to river-mouth The banks lie hidden (strange! he smiles) At Bath a house . . . but how is this? You hear with fortitude sublime These shocking— Ed. Well, the secret is They happen in the nick of time. Air. The Editor. Let tempests work their wildest will, Let torrent-rain our meadows flood, Ill were the wind, and worse than ill, That blew to no man aught of good. This hurricane that sweeps the skies, One really almost might aver 'Twas sent express to advertise Our Glycerine Barometer. For marked ye not, on Tuesday last, When Gordon Bennett flashed “Beware! A dangerous gale is speeding fast Towards your fated shores. Prepare!” How in its tube the fluid fell, And how the storm which would occur It did to all the world foretell— Our Glycerine Barometer. So was it published to mankind What precious food the ‘Times’ supplies To those who seek its page to find The wisdom of the weather-wise. To all the journals of the day Such persons should our print prefer, Since in its office hangs alway A Glycerine Barometer. One column of instructive stuff They're sure to find—that one I mean Which we must now with vigour puff, And which consists of Glycerine. For though our news be somewhat stale, And though our views may sometimes err, Nor novelty nor truth can fail Our Glycerine Barometer. What if a daily hash we make Of names, dates, titles, and degrees, If rank as Colonels Captains take And “Barts.” descend to K.C.B.'s? What if our “reader” takes no heed And printers' errors oft recur? At least we acurately read Our Glycerine Barometer. What if of news on every lip No notice in the ‘Times’ appears, And frightful gas explosions slip Unheeded past our dreaming ears? At least our vigilance is good For signs of atmospheric stir: No surreptitious storms elude Our Glycerine Barometer. (A pause. Then somewhat sadly:) Yet in my joy—'tis always so— A seed of bitterness is hid: “Leporum fonte medio Amari surgit aliquid.” I see, and not without a shock, New triumphs older glories blur, And mourn our famous Weathercock Outshone by our Barometer. THE FUN OF IT. (1880.) “No one gives us any fun.” . . . .—Spectator, Dec. 11. 'Tis very true, thou thoughtful Print; Of that same fun thou hankerest after There seems just now a certain stint In manufactories of laughter. Yet deem not, good Spectator, pray, That we poor melancholy creatures Find not in politics to-day Abundance of amusing features. 'Tis funny—every one must own, Without distinction, Whig and Tory— This Ireland paralysed and prone, Her neck beneath the foot of Rory. Droll in themselves her troubles are; And judges note at each assizes Their wealth of incidents bizarre, Their fruitfulness in quaint surprises. We all enjoy—as who would not?— The “points” in the agrarian battle: The tenants tortured, landlords shot; The tail-docked sheep, the hamstrung cattle; The rude art-work of Rory's pen, Symbolical of threatened lives; The graves of yet unmurdered men Absurdly dug in carriage-drives. We mark the comic element That visible in Boycott's fate is, The forty score of troopers sent To help get in the Captain's “praties.” We see the joke when pale police Entreat a man to curb his anger And take his cudgelling in peace, Or “all their lives” would be in danger. We feel the humour of reports That, where the Queen's writ runs no longer, There the Land-Leaguers' mimic courts (Less learned than “the Four”—but stronger) Make orders instantly obeyed; Give judgments, unreviewed for error; And wield, in short, that playful blade, The dagger of the Irish Terror. These things divert; but underneath There lies this piece of broader humour, That while the patient bleeds to death The doctors' strife engrosses Rumour. Law, Order, Life kept waiting on The wrangling, fumbling legislator! That joke's too plain for mother's son To miss, I take it, dear Spectator. So if to laugh we are not quick, Although we own the jest so gladly, Ascribe it to our English trick Of taking all our pleasures sadly. Just so should we, I dare to say, In Rome's most famous conflagration, Have viewed in the same stolid way The humours of the situation; Nor, as we watched the city burn, Should we (for man's so strange a riddle) Have yearned, as you appear to yearn, For the brisk notes of Nero's fiddle. “DOWN TO DESSERT.” (1881.) Non nobis! The dinner is over, Speed waiters the table to clear; Disappears through the door the last cover— But stay! what new guests have we here? Who are these who come wearily trooping— A strange unpresentable crowd, With shoulders ungracefully stooping, And knees somewhat awkwardly bowed; In whose faces, though lacking in fulness, The careful observer descries, To redeem them from absolute dulness, The wolf's most expressive of eyes? The remains of the feast they examine With hunger's keen glances alert: Can it be that these children of Famine Are only asked in to dessert? Can it be? Yes, it certainly can be: The host, with magnificent air, Bids welcome each want-stricken man be, And leads him in state to a chair. “My friends!” he exclaims with emotion, “Your dinner, I fear will be small; But, believe me, I hadn't a notion You cared about dinners at all. To forget that extreme inanition Disposes a man to a meal Was—was .... well, of course, an omission, As now I regretfully feel. But the moment I heard you'd expected Your ‘cards’ would be sent, and were hurt At the thought that your claims were neglected I asked you at once to dessert. “But should I keep talking for ever The past I should fail to undo; So, late being better than never, I beg you at once to fall to. The prime haunch of venison is finished, The saddle of mutton all gone, The baron of beef is diminished To yon undesirable bone. But we've gooseberries crimson and yellow, And strawberries (best without cream); Those plums are delightfully mellow, Those nuts—though I say it—supreme. On those olives—best French, I assure you— Your powers of consumption exert; No pains have been spared to procure you A truly recherché dessert.” Oh, Gladstone! look well at that table! Look well at it, Forster and Bright! De vobis narratur my fable: Can none of you read it aright? When the strong meats of land-confiscation Were dressed for the peasant's repast, Was it really humane legislation To think of the hungriest last? It is not very pleasant perceiving That you who that banquet have spread Could so quietly contemplate leaving These poor squalid wretches unfed; That the fruits of your cutting and carving To tenants alone should revert, And the labourer, landless and starving, Be only “brought down to dessert.” THE PATRIARCH'S HOME-COMING. (1881.) Beyond the Vaal, in those wild lands, The “simple scriptural people's” seat, A farmstead in the gloaming stands Alert its lord's return to greet. The clean-swept floor, the dusted shelf; The new-lit lamp's expectant look; The trim array of shining delf; The arm-chair in the ingle-nook; The cosy curtains close drawn in; The housewife listening at the door With hand upraised to hush the din Of younker-gambols on the floor; All tell a tale of anxious love; While, open on the window-seat, A Bible's well-thumbed pages prove Where fears and faith's assurance meet. But hark! that sound! a horse's neigh, The lowing of a startled steer, The tramp of hoofs upon the way; “It is! it is! my Piet is here!” O sanctity of wife-embrace! Let none with supercilious shrug Deride a simple scriptural race Who thus can conjugally hug. And now when kissed were wife and child “Say, Piet, 'tis not bad luck again?” Cried anxious wife: the husband smiled And pointed proudly at his train. “Look, Vrow!” he said: and at the view She turned, her tears of joy to hide. “I knew it would be so! I knew The Lord,” she murmured, “would provide! “I prayed; and waited free from fear Till he should bring you back once more Victorious of your bow and spear, Blest in your basket and your store. “And lo! He puts some dozen head Of noble beasts within your reach, With many a fine large Kaffir maid Well worth at least ten shillings each! “So now, my Piet, with heartfelt thanks Break we the Christian's humble bread: Tether the cattle in their ranks, And put the hussies in the shed!” Then they two, with no formal grace, But asking, as from hearts that feel, A benediction, took their place Before their frugal evening meal. And many a sympathetic prayer From Radicals beyond the sea Was breathed above the worthy pair And blessed their simple scriptural tea. THE MODEST POSTULATES. (1880.) Let it be granted that mankind Put off all passions sinister, And got a new and virtuous mind When we got our new Minister; Let it be granted we have found That Gladstone's mere arising The long-divided world has bound In brotherhood surprising; That Russians from their plots desist, And find a solace sweeter In working out the will of Christ Than any Will of Peter; That Italy now no longer dreams A new Trentine Magenta; That Austria cares not who redeems Italia Irredenta; That Germany suspects not France, That France forgives her neighbour; And both lead off the Arcadian dance With pastoral pipe and tabor; That men are dragged from plough and desk And armed and drilled by millions Merely to make more picturesque Millennial cotillons; That all the nations, in a word, Our Gladstone's visions now share, And yearn to turn the spear and sword To pruning-hook and ploughshare; That envy, restlessness, and dread, And sleepless-eyed suspicion, And hope, and hate, and greed are dead And buried—with ambition; That no one fears to lose his own, Or other's goods has wanted: Be these our postulates alone; Let only these be granted, And we may sing our Q.E.D. With lawful jubilation; For “Europe's Concert” proved will be By force of “demonstration.” WHAT SHALL WE THINK OF THE KURDS? (1880.) Worshipful patrons of “young nationalities,” Ardent promoters of “movements of race,” Learned in Destinies, Forces, Fatalities, Help us to settle a troublesome case. For proper bestowing Of sympathies glowing We feel a solicitude stronger than words; So, please, a suggestion For solving the question Of what should be thought of the Kurds. How should it act on our moral economy Tidings to get of Abdullah the Sheikh Boldly proclaiming a Kurdish autonomy, Just as it might be Slavonic or Greek? This being read of him, What's to be said of him— He who this national movement has stirred? How should we meet it, How properly treat it— The raid of this vigorous Kurd? Turkey we all of us know is “unspeakable;” Persia is “cruel, corrupt, and effete;” Should we, then, hope that Abdullah's a Sheikh able Sultan and Shah and their armies to beat? Does he, like Hofer, A tyrant to “go for,” A sword of deliverance valiantly gird? Ought we to pray for him? Ought we to say for him Go it, my patriot Kurd? Or shall we check sentimental intensities While we recall the repute of the tribe, Persons to whom certain ugly propensities Common report has been wont to ascribe— A proneness unpleasant To harry the peasant, His homestead to wreck and to seize on his herds, To ravish and slaughter Wife, grandam, and daughter— For that is the way of the Kurds? Say, shall we then to an infamous State or to Infamous subjects our favour refuse? Answer us, sweet casuistic Spectator, do! Prithee enlighten us, good Daily News! Let us know whether, Comparing by feather These most disagreeably similar birds, Morality's letter And spirit go better With blessing or banning the Kurds. Can we wish well to the cause of autocracy, Knowing the sins of the Sultan and Shah? Can we for triumph of Kurdish democracy— Triumph of murderous brigands—hurrah? Or would it be moral, In view of this quarrel, Impartial dislike to distribute in thirds: Two parts of aversion For Turk and for Persian, Remainder reserved for the Kurds? A CONGRATULATORY ODE. (1878.) [The true version of the congratulatory Latin ode addressed to the Berlin Congress by “the well-known German poet Gustave Schwetschke,” and “distributed by Prince Bismarck's request among the Plenipotentiaries”—none other being genuine.] Rideamus igitur, Socii Congressus; Post dolores bellicosos, Post labores bumptiosos, Fit mirandus messus. Ubi sunt qui apud nos Lites litigâre, Moldo-Wallachæ frementes, Græculi esurientes? Heu! absquatulâre. Ubi sunt provinciæ Quas est laus pacâsse? Totæ, totæ sunt partitæ: Has tulerunt Muscovitæ, Illas Count Andrassy. Et quid est quod Angliæ Dedit hic Congressus? Jus pro aliis pugnandi, Mortuum vivificandi— Splendidi successus! Vult Joannes decipi Et bamboosulatur. Io Beacche! Quæ majestas! Ostreæ reportans testas Domum gloriatur! A LITERARY “CAUSE CÉLÈBRE. (1876.) [Samuel Perkins expoundeth the moral thereof to his son, Dudley James Perkins.] Here he comes! The paper, Mary. Ah, good morning, Dudley James. 'Ave you read this libel haction—this 'ere case of—what's their names? Oh, Buchanan vussus Taylor—there's a lesson, lad, for you In them singerlar proceedins; take and read 'em, Dudley, do. You who've caused so much disquiet both to me and to your ma, Not to say your aunt Jemima, where your expectations are. Yes, you know you 'ave, my boy; it's gettin' on for nigh a year Since you took to dress in velvet and knocked off your dinner-beer, Took to wear your collars lower and asoomed a moody stare; 'Ad a row with Snipp's assistant when he come to cut your 'air; Took to moonin' round the counter, muttrin' “lines to” doose knows what, Hodes and sonnicks, songs and ballids—and the other rhymin' rot; Changed your short black cutty for a dangling German chaney pipe And refused to join the fam'ly at the evenin' meal of tripe; Wouldn't take your ma o' Sundays to the “Welsh Harp” in the shay, But remained at home to finish your “Romaunt of Pegwell Bay.” Yes, my laddie, I have watched you—I have seen your little game, I've observed your haspirations after a poetic fame— “Fame himmortal,” if you please—for nothing short of that will do. Trade is low and butter vulgar—poetry's the line for you! Now, my boy, just read that haction—that'll tell you what they are, These 'ere poets that are soarin' o'er our 'eads so jolly far. Parts of it I 'ardly follered, but its English seems to be, Messrs Swinbun and Buchanan can't agree to disagree. Mr B. he wrote a satter, — droppin' down on Mr S., And complainin' as his werses were a little too “undress.” Well, this put, you may imagine, Mr S. upon his mettle. “What! you call my werse indecent? Gammon! it's the pot and kettle.” So he ups and slates Buchanan, calls him all the 'orrid names He can take and lay his tongue to—which is plenty, Dudley James— Treats the hother as a hinsect, looked at thro' the microscope By a far superior being — which is funny, let us 'ope. That, of course, annoys Buchanan, and he “counters” with a will, Calling Mr S. a “monkey” — which, let's 'ope, is funnier still. Then they drops it for a season (this occurred in '71). But you don't know much of poets if you think the war was done. Last year comes out “Jonas Fisher,” pokin' up the “Fleshly School” Once again: “Oho!” says Swinbun, keepin' very calm and cool, “Here's that hodious Buchanan at his dirty game again Sure as death. There can't be no one else among the race of men Who could think my werse indecent.” So he lets him 'ave it 'ot; Shied the mud he'd shied before, and shied some more that he had not. When Buchanan's all bespattered, then—most 'orrible of sells— Lo be'old yer! “Jonas Fisher” proves to be by summun else. 'Ence the haction which that plucky Mr Peter Taylor fights. That you see's what comes of printin' what a hangry poet writes. Lor! what larks to see them lawyers overaul Buchanan's lines, Dippin' in their scoops to try 'em like my cheeses, through the rines! Tastin' this and smellin' t'other. “Isn't this a little strong?” “Call that pure?” “Well, what of this now, for a hammatory song?” Yes, by George, I never laughed so 'earty, nor I never shall, As at earin' Mr 'Awkins read about that Injin gal, And the cuddlin' in the forest! Well, per'aps it meant no harm, Still the author owned hisself the scene was just a trifle warm. Then, of course, Buchanan's counsel—he was not agoin' to fail; So he dropped upon the “fleshlies” right and left and tooth and nail! “Grossly senshal,” “most indecent,” “hanimal passion consecrated.” Says the judge, “A style of poitry 'ighly to be deprecated!” Well, the upshot was Buchanan gets his verdict safe and sound, And he comes on Mr Taylor for a hundern-fifty pound. But, Lord love you, my dear Dudley, what a foolish price to pay! What a terrible exposy for the poets of the day! I dun know about their poems, which is dirty, which is clean; As to Mr Swinbun's “Ballids”—blowed if I know what they mean! So I gev my Jane a copy on her birthday last July Bound as natty as you please in blue morocker—for, says I, If my gal finds them corruptin', as some people says they are, She's a doosed sight more 'andy guessin' riddles than her Pa! But to think of them two poets showin' up each other's lines For the benefit of us the—what d'you call it?—Philistines. Passion, fancy, light and sweetness — well, maybe they've got 'em all; But they've one thing undeweloped — gumption: that's uncommon small! Why, when Briggs in hopen westry cheeked me—you remember, Dud, Makin' insolent allusions to my butter as Thames mud— Did I go to lawr about it—hugly-tempered as I am? Did I sue old Briggs for libel, defamation? Not for Sam! No, I knew old Briggs's counsel—he'd contrive to 'ave his fling, And my butter—well mud's 'umbug, but — 'taint always quite the thing! And although I know a thing or two about old Briggs's tea, “Boshy butter” don't get nicer by denouncin' “dirt-Bohea.” What's the good of each exposin' t'other's tricks of trade on hoath? Plaintiff wins, or p'raps defendant, but the neighbours laugh at both; Yet you find the “'igher intlek” blind to facs as plain as this— Facs which any common tradesman's too much common-sense to miss. Yes, my boy, this ought to cure you—reverations such as these. You will stick to butter, Dudley—butter, bacon, heggs, and cheese, Rather than become a poet like them two as lately fought, Bringin' out their little wash-tubs, stupid-like, in hopen court; And—to dab each other's faces with the soapy froth and foam— Washed their dirty clothes in public, which they might have washed at 'ome!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MIMICRIES THE GOD AND THE DAMOSEL. [Suggested by the immortal picture, under this title, of Mr Symphony Priggins.] The God. Look in my face, and know me who I am. I smite and save; I bless, and, lo, I damn. Incline thine head, thy browless brow incline; I touch thee, and I tap thee, and proclaim, For ever and for ever thou art mine! O long as grief, and leaner than desire! O sweet retreating breasts and amorous-kissing knees! O grace and goodliness of strait attire! A robe of them who sport in summer seas. By these, and by the eyelids of thine eyes, Ringed round with darkness, swollen weeper-wise, By these I know thee; these are for a sign, Surer, yea, even than thy most splendid size Of spreaden hands: I know thee, thou art mine. The Damosel. Master and lord, I know thee who thou art; Lo, and with homage of the stricken heart, I hail thee, I adore thee, and obtest: I am thine own, I know no better part; Do with me, master as thee seemeth best. O loose as thought and bodiless as a dream! O globular grand eyes, a bane of maidenhood! O miracle of tunic-folds that seem Self-balanced, firm, a glory of carven wood. By these, and by the crown thy temples wear, Holy, a cauline flower of wondrous hair; By thy red mouth, a bow without a chord, And shaftless, yea, but deadly, O most fair. I knew thee, and I know thee for my lord! The God. Ay, now the flicker of a nauseate smile Bestirs thy cheek and wan lips imbecile; Thy pale plucked blossom droops; its day is done. The Damosel. Nay, let me deck my bosom therewithal, It were ill-ominous to let it fall, The faithful mistress of Hyperion Sun. The God. Stoop thou—what ails thee, child, to shudder?—stoop and brush Hair with tow-towzled hair, that for a space I breathe my godhead through thy thirsting veins, and flush The soft submalar hollows of thy face, And thrill thee, crown to sole, till that in downward rush Of eager ecstasy with fair flat feet thou crush The beetle, Virtue, in the lowly place. The Damosel. Ah, master and lord, I feel it; the wind of thy fierce delight, Hell-hot as the blast from the furnace, sea-cold as a gust of the sea. O deaf blind Love, that art deaf as a poker and blind as the night! O my flushed faint cheeks and my chin! O mine eye and the elbow of me! I bow to thy might, O my lord, to the keen-blown breath of thy lips, With a loathing of love that longs, and a longing of love that loathes, With shiver of angular shoulders, and shake of invisible hips, As boweth the light slight stake in the torture of wind-whirled clothes! Thou hast rent me enough, O Divine! . . . and behold, thou stayest thine hand, And leavest me crushed as a reed, that I wot not whether I tread Upon Earth, our holy old mother, with feet downpressing, or stand Inverse in a fearless new fashion, uplift on my passionate head! FROM “THE PUSS AND THE BOOTS.” Put case I circumvent and kill him: good. Good riddance—wipes at least from book o' th' world One ugly admiration-note-like blot— Gives honesty more elbow-room by just The three dimensions of one wicked knave. But then slips in the plaguy After-voice. “Wicked? Holloa! my friend, whither away So fast? Who made you, Moses-like, a judge And ruler over men to spare or slay? A blot wiped off forsooth! Produce forthwith Credentials of your mission to erase The ink-spots of mankind—t' abolish ill For being what it is, is bound to be, Its nature being so—cut wizards off In flower of their necromantic lives For being wizards, when 'tis plain enough That they have no more wrought their wizardship Than cats their cathood.” Thus the plaguy Voice, Puzzling withal not overmuch, for thus I turn the enemy's flank: “Meseems, my friend, Your argument's a thought too fine of mesh, And catches what you would not. Every mouse Trapped i' the larder by the kitchen wench Might reason so—but scarcely with effect. Methinks 'twould little serve the captured thief To plead, ‘The fault's Dame Nature's, guiltless I. Am I to blame that in the parcelling-out Of my ingredients the Great Chemist set Just so much here, there so much, and no more (Since 'tis but question, after all is said, Of mere proportion 'twixt the part that feels And that which guides), so much proclivity To nightly cupboard-breaking, so much lust Of bacon-scraps, such tendency to think Old Stilton-rind the noblest thing on earth? Then the per contra—so much power to choose The right and shun the wrong; so much of force Of uncorrupted will to stoutly bar The sensory inlets of the murine soul, And, when by night the floating rare-bit fume Lures like a siren's song, stop nostrils fast With more than Odusseian sailor-wax: Lastly so much of wholesome fear of trap To keep self-abnegation sweet. Then comes The hour of trial, when lo! the suadent scale Sinks instant, the deterrent kicks the beam, The heavier falls, the lighter mounts (as much A thing of law with motives as with plums), And I, forsooth, must die simply because Dame Nature, having chosen so to load The dishes, did not choose suspend for me The gravitation of the moral world.’ How would the kitchen-wench reply? Why thus (If given, as scullions use, to logic-fence And keen retorsion of dilemmata In speeches of a hundred lines or so): ‘Grant your plea valid. Good. There's mine to hear. 'Twas Nature made you? well: and me, no less; You she by forces past your own control Made a cheese-stealer? Be it so: of me By forces as resistless and her own She made a mouse-killer. Thus, either plays A rôle in no wise chosen of himself, But takes what part the great Stage Manager Cast him for, when the play was set afoot. Remains we act ours—without private spite, But still with spirit and fidelity, As fits good actors: you I blame no whit For nibbling cheese—simply I throw you down Unblamed—nay, even morally assoiled, To pussy there: blame thou not me for that.’ Or say perhaps the girl is slow of wit, Something inapt at ethics—why, then thus: ‘Enough of prating, little thief! This talk Of “fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,” Is hugely out of place! What next indeed, If all the casuistry of the schools Be prayed in aid by every pilfering mouse That's caught i' th' trap? See here, my thieving friend, Thus I resolve the problem. We prefer To keep our cheeses for our own behoof, And eat them with our proper jaws; and so, Having command of mouse-traps, we will catch Whatever mice we can, and promptly kill Whatever mice we catch. Entendez-vous? Ay, and we will, though all the mice on earth Pass indignation votes, obtest the faith Of gods and men, and make the welkin ring With world-resounding dissonance of squeak!’” But hist! here comes my wizard! Ready then My nerves—and talons—for the trial of strength! A stout heart, feline cunning, and—who knows? THE MODERN POET'S SONG. Where hast thou been since battlemented Troy Rose like a dream to thy loud-stricken lyre? Why dost thou walk the common earth no more? Nor lead on high Parnass the Muses' choir, As when thy Hellas rang from shore to shore With harpings loud, and hymns of holy joy? Well may we for thy gracious presence long: The fashion of the day is classic myth, And he must liberally deal therewith Who fain would sing the modern poet's song. Shake from thy brow the hyacinthine locks That hide its ivory splendours! Let thine eyes Flash forth as blue-white lightnings lubricate, Spread sudden day through purple midnight skies, Or scarlet shafts of dawn illuminate The grey and umber of the sleeping rocks! O colours and O shades of every hue, Plain or in combination, faint or strong, Red, green, and yellow, black and white and blue, How ye assist the modern poet's song! Far-darting Phoibos, lofty Loxias (Since thou the glad Greek greeting well mayst hear That hailed thee erst in Delos the divine), If our late lays have leave to reach thine ear, Meek, myrtle-bearing, give us grace to pass Through the white worshippers towards thy shrine. O apt alliteration! how a throng Of self-repeating vowels and consonants, How lines of labials, strings of sibilants, Make music in the modern poet's song! I will compare thee to a fowler wight, Snaring the soul with magic-woven words Of wondrous music and divinest art; Or haply I may liken, heard aright, Thy wingèd strains themselves to captured birds, Fast in the meshes of the human heart. For men and things resemble what we please, Such arbitrary powers to bards belong; And, in default of genuine similes, Conceits will serve the modern poet's song. Come thou, our lord; the heart within us dies, And, faint as in a breathless land and bare, We take no profit of our piteous day. Give us to look upon thee, O most fair; Appear, O sweet desire of all men's eyes, Ere this dread cup of life shall pass away! For vague appeals which we interpret not, And moody murmurs at unstated wrong, And aspirations for we say not what, Largely compose the modern poet's song. Come thou, and I my stanzas will illume With all the hues that in the rainbow meet, Alliterate all letters that there are; Outdo all rivals in mysterious gloom, Fetch metaphors like magi from afar, Lit by no star of meaning, to thy feet. For these and similar poetic tricks Are highly prized our master's school among. O Swinburne! and O water! how ye mix, To constitute the modern poet's song! AFTER DILETTANTE CONCETTI. “Why do you wear your hair like a man, Sister Helen? This week is the third since you began.” “I'm writing a ballad; be still if you can, Little brother. (O Mother Carey, mother! What chickens are these between sea and heaven?)” “But why does your figure appear so lean, Sister Helen? And why do you dress in sage, sage green?” “Children should never be heard, if seen, Little brother? (O Mother Carey, mother! What fowls are a-wing in the stormy heaven!)” “But why is your face so yellowy white, Sister Helen? And why are your skirts so funnily tight?” “Be quiet, you torment, or how can I write, Little brother? (O Mother Carey, mother! How gathers thy train to the sea from the heaven!)” “And who's Mother Carey, and what is her train, Sister Helen? And why do you call her again and again?” “You troublesome boy, why that's the refrain, Little brother. (O Mother Carey, mother! What work is toward in the startled heaven?)” “And what's a refrain? What a curious word, Sister Helen! Is the ballad you're writing about a sea-bird?” “Not at all; why should it be? Don't be absurd, Little brother. (O Mother Carey, mother! Thy brood flies lower as lowers the heaven.)” (A big brother speaketh:)“The refrain you've studied a meaning had, Sister Helen! It gave strange force to a weird ballàd. But refrains have become a ridiculous ‘fad’ Little brother. And Mother Carey, mother, Has a bearing on nothing in earth or heaven. “But the finical fashion has had its day, Sister Helen. And let's try in the style of a different lay To bid it adieu in poetical way, Little brother. So, Mother Carey, mother! Collect your chickens and go to—heaven.” (A pause. Then the big brother singeth, accompanying himself in a plaintive wise on the triangle :) “Look in my face. My name is Used-to-was; I am also called Played-out and Done-to-death, And It-will-wash-no-more. Awakeneth Slowly, but sure awakening it has, The common-sense of man; and I, alas! The ballad-burden trick, now known too well, Am turned to scorn, and grown contemptible— A too transparent artifice to pass. “What a cheap dodge I am! The cats who dart Tin-kettled through the streets in wild surprise Assail judicious ears not otherwise; And yet no critics praise the urchin's ‘art,’ Who to the wretched creature's caudal part Its föolish empty-jingling ‘burden’ ties.” A DRAWING-ROOM BALLAD. Can you recall an ode to June Or lines to any river In which you do not meet the “moon,” And see “the moonbeams quiver”? I've heard such songs to many a tune, But never yet—no niver— Have I escaped that rhyme to “June” Or missed that rhyme to “river.” At times the bard from his refrain A moment's respite snatches, The while his over-cudgelled brain At some new jingle catches; Yet long from the unlucky moon Himself he cannot sever, But grasps once more that rhyme to “June,” And seeks a rhyme to “river.” Then let not indolence be blamed On him whose verses show it By shunning “burdens” (rightly named For reader and for poet); For rhymes must fail him late or soon, Nor can he deal for ever In words whose sound resembles “June,” And assonants of “river.” When “loon”'s been used, and “shoon” and “spoon,” And “st?ver” sounded “st?ver,” Think of a bard reduced to “'coon,” And left alone with “liver”! Ah, then, how blessèd were the boon! How doubly blest the giver, Who gave him one rhyme more for “June,” And one more rhyme for “river”! VERS DE SOCIÉTÉ. There, pay it, James! 'tis cheaply earned; My conscience! how one's cabman charges! But never mind, so I'm returned Safe to my native street of Clarges. I've just an hour for one cigar (What style these Reinas have, and what ash!) One hour to watch the evening star With just one Curacao-and-potash. Ah me! that face beneath the leaves And blossoms of its piquant bonnet! Who would have thought that forty thieves Of years had laid their fingers on it! Could you have managed to enchant At Lord's to-day old lovers simple, Had Robber Time not played gallant, And spared you every youthful dimple! That Robber bold, like courtier Claude, Who danced the gay coranto jesting, By your bright beauty charmed and awed, Has bowed and passed you unmolesting. No feet of many-wintered crows Have traced about your eyes a wrinkle; Your sunny hair has thawed the snows That other heads with silver sprinkle. I wonder if that pair of gloves I won of you you'll ever pay me! I wonder if our early loves Were wise or foolish, cousin Amy? I wonder if our childish tiff Now seems to you, like me, a blunder! I wonder if you wonder if I ever wonder if you wonder I wonder if you'd think it bliss Once more to be the fashion's leader! I wonder if the trick of this Escapes the unsuspecting reader! And as for him who does or can Delight in it, I wonder whether He knows that almost any man Could reel it off by yards together! I wonder if— What's that? A knock? Is that you, James? Eh? What? God bless me! How time has flown! It's eight o'clock, And here's my fellow come to dress me. Be quick, or I shall be the guest Whom Lady Mary never pardons; I trust you, James, to do your best To save the soup at Grosvenor Gardens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POST LUSUS SERIA TO A FAMOUS PARLIAMENT. Hunc neque dira venena nec hosticus auferet ensis Nec laterum dolor aut tussis nec tarda podagra; Garrulus hunc quando consumet cumque; loquace Si sapiat, vitet, simul atque adoleverit aetas. As one who from the glacier past the vine Follows the slow debasement of the Rhine To where its foiled and sluggish waters creep Through sand-obstructed channels to the deep— As such an one may in fantastic mood Muse on the checkered fortunes of the flood, The source majestic whence its streams descend, Its proud career and its ignoble end,— Thus—but in sober earnestness—are we, O English Parliament, to think of thee? Of thee on flats of dull Obstruction found The long-descended and the high-renowned! O thou whose shame or glory is our own, Born with our birth, and with our growth upgrown! Was it for this the wasting hand of time, Perils of youth, and maladies of prime, Spared thee so long? O thou who first didst draw In a rude age the infant breath of law, And, storing silent increments of life Through our long era of dynastic strife, Take gradual heart of grace thy voice to raise From whispering humbleness of Tudor days; Wrest the high sceptre from thy Stuart lords; Bend only for an hour to Cromwell's swords; Live faction down, break through corruption's chains, And of the Walpole-poison purge thy veins; Wax stronger and still stronger, till the land Saw all its forces gathered to thine hand— Didst thou thus triumph that thou thus shouldst fall? Is that proud head that towers over all Destined to bow before unworthy foes? Had ever splendid life so mean a close As thine will show, if thou, for all thy past, Must die of talk and Irishmen at last? ON A FAMOUS BILL: THE LAWYER'S SOLILOQUY. I hold it clear, as one who sings The party song in divers tones, That men may rise on stepping-stones Of brazen speech to higher things. And, holding this as maxim chief, Ill were my part of lawyer played Did I not welcome undismayed The burden of this desperate brief. For well his trade he understood, And wise that statesman was, I wot, Who valued their assistance not That helped him when his case was good: Who knew how cheaply could be had The summer-weather partisan, And used to say, “Give me the man That backs me when my case is bad!” I am that man. Behold in me A faithful yeoman of debate, Ever at hand the case to state For Land Bill Number Twenty-three. O Bill, unfriended of the wise, Poor derelict of truth and sense, Thy blackest blot and worst offence Is light and virtue in my eyes. They say thy purpose is concealed, And that the coy design which strays Nymph-like, through tangled woods of phrase Might blush to find itself revealed. The more the need that I should spare No pains to lead the chase awry, The while I vigorously cry, “The nymph, although unseen, is fair!” The dull Economist fulfils His mission to denounce thy scheme As flattery of the peasant's dream And worsening of his waking ills. The greater the demand on me For cheaply manufactured sneers At imbeciles who feed their fears On bugbears of Economy. Of contracts' broken faith they prate, Of justice made a Lesbian rule, And law degraded to the tool Of mean expediencies of State. And here they touch me nearly—here They press me home: yet only so Can all the party zeal I show Clothed in its full deserts appear. So much the greater shall my feat Of bold apostasy be found, So louder shall my praises sound Where Tadpoles and where Tapers meet, In that I falter not nor swerve From Ministerial paths, nor err Through foolish reverence for Her Whose bread I eat, whose shrine I serve: That, holding Justice not in awe, I find no filial wrath upflame Though bastard legislation shame The household of her priestess, Law; But bear to see her bed defiled— Nay, dare, unnaturally brave, To strike my mother dead to save Blind Faction's misbegotten child! AVE CÆSAR! MORTUI TE SALUTANT. (June 1879.) “Yes, it is well to mourn him,” foes Alike with friends can say; That bright young life's pathetic close Disarms all hates to-day. None needs to grudge that there be flung On that untimely grave All flowers of pity for the young, The innocent, the brave. Not his the sins that marred his land, Though they were sinned for him; No war was kindled by his hand Because his star grew dim. And therefore it is well that now The willing tear be shed For the poor stripling Prince laid low Among inglorious dead. But also well that we should mark Hovering above the gate Of death, the levelled hand, the dark And awful brows of Fate; And hear what ghostly murmurs swell Around the fatal spot, From countless shades of those who fell At Wörth and Gravelotte. “What robe of empire now clothes on This body pierced and bare? Where is the purple, Cæsar's son, We died that you might wear? Was it for this we shed our blood, For this poor naked prey Of savage wile, this fated food For Zulu assegai? Left we for this our children dear, Sweet faces of our wives? Caesar—if Death the dead can hear— Give back to us our lives!” THE AGE OF DESPAIR. “Drink deep of life ere death's unending calm Enfold thee round.” So runs the dreary psalm, Miscalled a song of joy, by poets sung, From jesting Horace down to grave Khayyam. We sing it now; but who that sings achieves One hour's pure triumph over him who grieves? Who can rejoice in summer, if his heart Fore-hear the rustle of the falling leaves? Vainly the farce of gaiety is played; Death smiles sardonic on the poor parade; Nor can our hollow laughters exorcise That spectre whom the old-world revellers laid. The rose they wreathed around the careless head, The wine they poured, the perfumes that they shed, The eyes that smiled on them, the lips they pressed, For us what are they? Faded, vapid, dead! Dead is for us the rose we know must die; Long ere we drain the goblet it is dry; And, even as we kiss, the distant grave Chills the warm lip and dims the lustrous eye! Too far our race has journeyed from its birth; Too far Death casts his shadow o'er the earth. Ah! what remains to strengthen and support Our hearts, since they have lost the trick of mirth, The stay of fortitude? The lofty pride Wherewith the sages of the Porch denied That pain and death are evils, and proclaimed Lawful the exit of the suicide? Alas, not so! No Stoic calm is ours; We dread the thorns who joy not in the flowers. We dare not breathe the mountain-air of Pain, Droop as we may in Pleasure's stifling bowers. What profits it, if here and there we see A spirit nerved by trust in God's decree, Who fronts the grave in firmness of the faith Taught by the Carpenter of Galilee? Who needs not wine nor roses, lute nor lyre, Scorns life, or quits it by the gate of fire, Erect and fearless—what is that to us Who hold him for the dupe of vain desire? Can we who wake enjoy the dreamer's dream? Will the parched treeless waste less hideous seem Because there shines before some foolish eyes Mirage of waving wood and silver stream? Ah, miserable race! Too weak to bear, Too sad for mirth, too sceptical for prayer! Surely on you the Scripture is fulfilled, To bid the mountains cover your despair!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ANTS' NEST. I've an ants' nest in my garden, and on sleepy summer days I delight to sit beside it, and to watch the works and ways Of the busy little people (watched of late too closely these By a far less kindly Virgil than who sang the civic bees), While I muse upon the impulse, silent, hidden—full of awe, Whether it be force of Godhead or of self-fulfilling law,— That, by every year's mid-season, crowds the air with humming wings, Covers earth's abounding bosom with the toil of tiny things. Thus engaged the other evening, lounged me by my gardener's boy, Futile lout and turnip-headed, whom I foolishly employ At a certain weekly stipend to do nothing with a hoe, And to train the climbing roses where I want them not to grow: Lounged me by, I say, this booby, and, in passing—Master Sam Being of the age when mischief has the zest of epigram— Poised a heavy hob-nailed Blucher o'er the hapless little state, And with one strong kick of ruin spurned it flat and desolate! Thus he did. Then I, indignant at the blockhead's brutal jest, Seized him by the nape, and straightway to his ample ears addressed, In the only way to make them take a message to his brain, Strong advice against indulging in such pleasantries again. Off he sneaked, demissâ caudâ, and I turned me, full of ruth, To the commonwealth subverted by the too facetious youth, Seeking if, among the ruins of their city thus laid low, Haply might be found a suburb still inhabitable. No! Thread-like street and atom gateway, where awhile ago had trod Tiny feet of thronging thousands, all was formless mould and clod; Only here and there were hurrying houseless burghers two or three, Dazed, bewildered, void of counsel, o'er the hideous débris, Waiting doubtless his appearing, calm amid their shattered haunts, His, the shepherd of the people, his, the “leader born of ants,” The creative, the constructive, “still, strong” ant, with purpose high Order to educe from chaos, law evoke from anarchy; Who shall nerve his helpless fellows with their adverse fates to cope, Fortify them with his patience, animate them with his hope; So that, howsoever slowly, with whatever toil and pain, From its ruins may the devastated city rise again, And resume its peaceful labours and renew its prosperous day Unmolested—till some other booby chance to pass that way. Moralising o'er my claret in my library that night, “Ah!” thought I, “how much more hopeful, arduous though it be, the fight Fought by man with hostile Nature's banded forces, age by age, Than is waged by lower races, or than they can ever wage! Yonder ants repair their ruins: well, a city straight appears Built as ants have built their cities any time these myriad years; Just as fragile and defenceless, nowise safer in the least, From the boot of playful boyhood, or the hoof of straying beast. Weak they stand, and fall through weakness, and in weakness rise again, Death instructs not, and disaster brings not wisdom in its train. But mankind? We stand confronting calm our overshadowing foe, Lightnings strike us, tempests whelm us, plague and famine lay us low; Yet with every blow he levels weaker grows the giant blind, Stronger Polypheme's Odysseus foreordained — the human mind; Stronger grows man's strength of cunning his worldenemies to brave, Some to baffle, some to conquer, some to capture and enslave. Fire he tames, and water serves him, earth her treasure-hiding robe Raises at his bidding, lightning speeds his message round the globe. These once foes he makes his vassals; other foes more hostile still, Irreclaimable to service, forces only strong for ill, These he cheats or neutralises, circumvents or turns aside, Ever setting back their limits as sea-walls set back the tide. Each succeeding generation breathes a stronger healthier breath; Every decade sees new tillage conquered from the wastes of death; Nature yearly makes submissions; soon the philosophic dream Will become the workday waking, and mankind will reign supreme, Master of the world around him, king of his environment Absolute, and waiting only that deliverance latestsent, Man's redemption from his passions, from that scourge self-wielded, crime, From the brutal lust of battle (blunted even now by time), And from competition, blindest of the conflicts that divide And dividing weaken workers who should labour side by side— Which deliverance once accomplished, dawns for him a brighter day Than the golden age of fable, never more to pass away! Shall we then,” I cried elated (reaching down from off its shelf ‘Comte,’ in Martinean's translation), “shall we only live for self? We of the unbounded future shall we in the present rest, Narrowing ant-like aspirations to the limits of our nest; Striving through life's summer only as the ant laborious strives To provide what may suffice us for the winter of our lives? And not rather learn to look beyond our own day's little span, So to live that we may help to hasten on the Reign of Man. Forasmuch as surely knowing, while we labour and abstain, That our labour in our Lord, Humanity, is not in vain.” How it chanced I do not know— That my claret served me so, Sound as is that modest drink, I am loath indeed to think; But howbeit, truth to tell, Musing thus asleep I fell, And I heard a Voice whose tones Froze the marrow in my bones, Crying, “Labour and abstain! Labour spent will not be vain If it harden thee to bear The full weight of man's despair: And to practise abstinence From the pleasant things of sense, Easier makes of abnegation Pleasures of imagination.” Here a pause; then once again: “Labour, labour, and abstain, Ye who will—or ye who can, But ere thou, O dreamer Man, Take the altruistic vow, Pledge thy comfortable Now To insure a glorious Then To the common race of men, Open eyes of sleep and see What the womb of time is bearing, What millennium is preparing For ‘your Lord’ Humanity.” The voice surceased: and in a hush of awe The walls of dark were riven, and the night Became as day around me, and I saw, As from a tower, a strange and fearful sight. Earth, kindly Earth, our blithe and blossoming home, Far as to where her limits seemed to meet A sky spread o'er her like an iron dome, Lay dead beneath my feet! Dead—or her only life, the life-in-death Of moss and lichen; mute, with such repose As stirs but when the iceberg sundereth, Or sounds the distant grinding of the floes. This earth of springs and harvests, flocks and herds, Of toiling, laughing, loving, human throngs; Warmed by the sun, and glad with flight of birds, And rained on by their songs, Lay fruitless, soundless, dead: from zone to zone Spread over her the terrible control Of Arctic frost—the idle gloom, the lone And everlasting leisure of the Pole! Spake again the Voice abhorred: “Lo, the kingdom of your Lord! Lo, his dazzling palace-walls, And the silence in his halls, Marking in its depth intense A profounder reverence Than abates the courtier's tones At the foot of lower thrones.— Idle dreamer! vain and blind! Had thy vision-ridden mind In its scheme of earthly bliss And dominion room for this? Didst thou think that taming these, Lightning, famine, fire, disease— Powers that take thy yoke, or flee From thy face—was conquering Me? Fool of foolish boastings! They Are my children at their play! What so wastes the face of earth Is but malice of their mirth; All your famous victories gained Mean but infants' sports restrained. Deeper for your real foe Search ye—I abide below, Storing for your ‘age of gold’ Treasure of eternal cold, Weaving for man's ‘majesty’— Him, whose expectations high All your toils and hopes absorb On this slowly-freezing orb— Such a robe as may be meet For—a monarch's winding-sheet.” “Then is He the Creator of things? or is It their volitionless cause, Is it Spirit or Force,” I cried, in a passion of wonder and woe, “That breathes free life out of freedom, or, binding, is bound by laws? Was it choice or chance—was it Demon or Demiurge ordered it so? “Is our master a sightless Strength, unwilled—our oppressor in chains Of the iron he lays on ourselves? it is well: we can learn to bear As the slaves of a slave endure, for whom in their cruellest pains No longings of unwreaked hate disturb the content of despair. “But a Person? A Cause Uncaused? Can it be that deliberate Will, At a point in the vast Before whereunto no mind can climb, Appointed such end and prepared it, selecting such means to fulfil, Or e'er from Eternity's ocean arose the island of Time? “Can it be that the planets obeyed a commanding Voice? Can it be That no aimless impulse arrayed them around the solar fire, But that floatings of nebular masses were changed by conscious decree To the rhythmical music and march of a solid and orderly choir? “That the first faint thrills of the germ and the blind beginnings of life Were marked by a sentient Mind that, of fixed predeterminate plan, Had willed the fierce struggle of living, the pitiless secular strife, And thereout in the fulness of untold years the emergence of Man; “Had willed him emerge and survive, and that slowly, through age upon age, From the jungle and swamp to the city the painful ascent should be made, From the first rude stammer of tongues to the speech of the poet and sage, From the first rough knottings of barter to infinite network of trade; “From isolate weakness to fagoted strength in the communal band, To the peace and justice of States from the clashings of wilderness-wars; From the fingers that fashioned the flint to the fingers of Raphael's hand; From the skulls that bleach in the caves to the heads that have measured the stars; “To the end that at last—that at last the whole into night should go down Into night and the void, when the long-sought summit of things has been won, And the glorious God-planned scheme attain consummation and crown In the idiot whirl of a lifeless globe round a useless sun?” Yet once more the Voice whose tones Froze the marrow in my bones:— “Can it be, O can it be, (Cry the ants in agony,) That the power whose prescient mind Our illustrious race designed, Placed us here with cunning blest To construct our mighty nest, And to store our yearly fruit, Also foreordained the Boot That with catastrophic—” “Nay, Spare your sneers. Far happier they, In that only fancy sees Power in them for thoughts like these: In that whatsover fate Their frail race annihilate To despair it will condemn No immortal hopes in them. But for us! O God of truth, God of justice and of ruth! Does our everlasting wrong To thy equity belong? Did thy truth decree on high That we should believe a lie? And is thy compassion shown In a truth too late made known? Why to man alone this lot?” Cried the Voice: “And know'st thou not?” Then, in words of bitter gibe— “Claims not man's complacent tribe O'er the beasts pre-eminence, Chief in this—his laughter-sense? So the fate contrived for him Should appeal, in humour grim, To that faculty acute Which discerns him from the brute: Wherefore hopes and longings blind Were enkindled in his mind, And to fire's devouring strength Fanned and fostered—that at length Their evanishment in smoke Might produce the effect of joke!” “Ah, scoffer accursed!” I cried, “we know and too well we know How cruel a humour indulges the Power who breathed in us breath, How he bred in us love of our children and wives and rooted it so That our hearts are transfixed by the point of the terrible jest of death! “We know” (and my voice sank lower) “he even refines upon this, And deludes us with shadowy hopes of meetings beyond the grave, Though as yet he has spared undeceiving the weak and prolongs them the bliss Of the faith that he slowly tears from the tortured breasts of the brave! “But must we believe at your bidding that ‘life-in-the-future of earth’ Is the nothing of life-in-the-heavens? that that last pitiful gleam Is to fade from the sky of the soul, till the great World Jester his mirth Shall have sated on anguish of man in dispersing the Humanist dream?” No answer came. I cried again; No voice the silence broke Till silence seemed to burst my brain, And, sweating cold, I woke. I woke: long hours had fled, and lo! Dim-seen through curtains drawn, The moon's pale corpse is sinking slow In the grey pools of dawn. Night is departing terror-thronged, But unreleased I seem, For waking life awhile prolonged The questionings of dream, And break of day the hour had brought That bows the soul to earth In idle travail of a thought Which comes not to the birth; So to the voice that answered not Still cried I “Answer Thou! The dumb enigma of our lot Lies heaviest on us now.” But now! . . . The brooding East was riven, The morning-wind took wing, Above in the fast-brightening heaven The lark began to sing; Sweet through the lattice breathed the bine, The mower clinked his scythe; Rang out from 'mid the gathered kine The milkmaid's laughter blithe. Ah! blessèd sounds of wiser life, Contented with its day, How ye rebuke the inward strife That wears the soul away! And blessèd life itself! that holds, So we not shun its grasp, The troubled spirits it enfolds In soothing mother-clasp; Whose commonplaces merciful The brain from madness keep, And lull—so we but let them lull— Until we fall asleep.</field>
