The fyrste foole of the shyppt I am certayne That with my handes dresse the sayles all For to haue bookes I do all my besy payne Whiche I loue not to rede in specyall Nor them to se also in generall Wherfore it is a prouerbe all aboute Suche thynketh to knowe y? standeth in doubte. Of good counseyle. ca. ii. The counsayle the whiche dothe not well conserne His owne estate and grete affynyte And frome others hurte doth not his dyscerne Is well worthy to haue aduersyte And to be deiecte frome prosperyte For he bryngeth the hogge vnto the pyt And afterwarde reuerseth hym in it. Of auaryce and prodygalyte. capitulo. iii. Of the folysshe shyppe there dothe occupye the seconde parte/the auarycyous That wyll not gyue a poore man one peny He is so harde and so malycyous Beynge on his rychesse so curyous That is lente hym for a small ceason The poore at nede to defende by reason. Of newe customes and gyses. ca. iiii. He that desyreth our thynges newe For to begynne amonge poore mem all Parauenture he maye it ones sore rewe Whan he cometh before god eternall There to be Iuged in sentence fynall Where after his deserte he shall haue mede Yf he haue done well/ryght well he shall spede. Of auncyent fooles. ca. v. Alas for all that euer I enclyne To my sepulture both by houre and daye Yet can I not leue the folysshe ruyne That I haue contynued in alwaye And of olde fooles euer haue kepte the laye Wherfore of olde fooles I maye be the chefe For all that is vyce hathe ben to me lefe Of the document of chyldren. ca. vi. He that forgyueth the crymes ryght vycyous Of his chyldren without correctynge And them enduceth not in vertuous gloryous Is well worthy to haue grete tormentynge And eke anguysshe by longe contynuynge For why he seketh all the wayes he can To lyue in sorowe as a folysshe man. Of reportoures and detractoures. ca. vii. Who that maketh bate and also stryfe By fals enuy and double retortynge And he whiche synfully ledeth his lyfe Euer in vyce and synne contynuynge Without remors of inwarde repentynge Bytwene two mylstones his body doth bere There to haue guerdon as ye may se here. Of them that ensueth not good counseyle capitulo. ix. He is reputed a naturall foole That can nothynge dyscerne at no ceason Of his werkes for all he wente to to scoole And that he is so grounded on reason Yet it may happen at some encheason Whan he ploweth the mountaynes and the rockes For his foly to haue many grete mockes. Of folysshe meurs &amp; condycyons, ca. ix. Who kepeth his mayntene vnstedfast And all his gestes nothynge semely With fyers regarde and not shamefaste Lyght and mouable without curtesy And dysdeynous answerynge proudly He serchet wayes a foole to be Drawynge the hode as ye maye se. Of the hurtynge of amyte. ca. x. Who that doth Iustyce and greuaunce Agaynst vertue and equyte And excercyseth his puyssaunce Upon a man with cruelte By his euyll inyquyte Dothe the pyt of his tombe compose For of vertues he hathe no lose. Of the cont?nynge of scrypture. ca. xi. Who wyll byleue eloquacyte Of fooles seynge the scrypture Shewynge our grete felycyte And wyll not in vertues endure Is a grete foole without mesure Wherfore as fooles makynge dyscordes Of our grete shyp they dresse the cordes. xii Who fastneth not the sadle well Upon his horse whan he shall Unto some towne his ware to sell Thynkynge all sure on euery syde Yf he fall in some dyche syde They that passe by maye to hym saye There lyeth a foole without delaye Of vayne and tr?sytory loue. ca. xiii. The fooles that ben bounde with this corde I drawe in to myne excellent toures Bycause that they to me accorde In seruynge me well at all houres As true louers and paramoures For whome that I smyte feruently Can haue no salue but theyr lady Of th? that syn on the mercy of god. xiiii. Who thynketh that god is moued Unto mercy and grete pyte And that of synnes approued He wyll not ones auenged be He is a foole in certaynte For he must Iuge the synnes all And gyue on them sentence egall. Of fooles makynge edyfyces. ca. xv. He that wyll castelles edyfye Or buylde houses with lyme and stone Must not trust in his owne folye Lest he repente or it done For the thyage that is done anone Oftentymes they do repente Whan that theyr monye is all spente xvi Of pouerte the dede and charge Can no lecherous man eshewe That nyght and daye in metes large Euer in one dothe contynewe The daye shall come they shall it rewe For they dampne theyr soules in dede That etcth more than they haue nede. Of rychesse inutyle. ca. xvii. Who that loketh vp his rychsse In chestes alwaye there to lye And helpeth no man in dystresse Thoughe the poore man therfore sholde dye And be destroyed vtterly He is a foole at eche deuyse The poore men so for to dyspyse. Of the seruynge of two maysters. xviii. He that wyll take two hares at ones With one sole grehounde alonely Renneth throughe busshes for the nones Is a foole I you certyfye Shewynge by dede his grete foly For one can not two maysters serue At ones truely thoughe he wolde sterue. xix Who that can well his tongue refrayne Bothe ferre and nere in euery place And another mannes cousayll layne Is replynysshed with grete grace But he the whiche clatereth a pace Doth his propre counsall bewrye As with chatterynge dothe the pye. For to fynde other me?es goodes and not to yelde them agayne. ca. xxi. He the whiche fyndeth ony thynge. And employeth it to his vsage Alwaye of the same dyspendynge Is a grete fole and nothynge sage For the deuyll at eche passage Holdeth hym fast in a bande Go he by water or by lande. Of conscyon of sapyence. ca. xxii. Who delyteth in sapyence That is worthy of grete praysynge Shall growe to moche magnyfycence In the courte of some grete kynge And shall haue heuen at his endynge Where he shall lyue eternally With bryght aungelles gloryously. Of iactaunce and confydence of fortune. ca. xxiii. Who sayth he is well fortuned Bothe of body and of rychesse And that he was neuer greued Of fortunes whele full of rudenesse That casteth many in dystresse And brenneth houses all aboute Whan the poore fooles stande lest in doubte. xxiiii He that procureth by gre payne The werkes of his seruauntes all And leueth his by grete dysdayne Undone and nought yet therwithall A veraye foole men maye hym call For he wyll take mo werkes on hande Than he and his men may withstande Of them that taketh a truste. ca. xxv. He is a foole deuoyde of reason And ones shall be myserable That wyll borowe at eche ceason Golde and syluer transmutable And for to paye is not able Without he shold sell coote and gowne And after go begge in to the towne Of petytycyods and vowes inutyle. xxvi. Who that on handes and fete dothe praye By false dyssymulacyon Cryenge on god bothe nyght and daye That he wolde graunte vnto hym pardon And gyue them clene remyssyon They be fooles that with cryenge Thynketh to opteyne ony thynge xxvii Who wyll not excercyse studye But renne aboute from place to place Is replysshed with foly And is deiecte from all grace For no scyence he wyll purchace Wherfore he shall repente hym sore Bycause he wolde not lerne nomore Of them that speke folysshly agaynst god capitulo. xxviii. If god wolde here fooles prayer After theyr wyll and theyr peasure They wole make it ryght synguler With wepynge eyen ye may be sure Yf that they myght it so procure But god wyll not to them assente Seynge theyr vnhappy entente To gyue iugement on an other. xxix. Some thynketh that they be ryght Iuste And Iugeth other mennes vyse Saynge that to hell go they muste And neuer come in paradyse He is a foole at eche deuyse To Iuge an other mannes mysdede And wyll not of his owne take hede. Of theym that charge theym with benefyces. ca. xxx. Who some euer dothe apppetyte Benefyces by grete plenty And taketh in them no delyte Saue for the rentes alonely He is not wyse I you certyfye For and he bere more than he maye He is lykly to fall by the waye Of them that desyre for to amende them frome daye to daye. ca. xxxi. Who dothe ensue the rauens songe Sayenge I shall amende to morowe And contynueth in it longe Is lyke to fall in to moche sorowe But yf our lorde wyll be his borowe For and he euer that songe synge It shall hym streyght vnto helle brynge Of them that wyll kepe wyues. xxxii. Of this foole sore I meruayll That casteth water in the well And of one withouten say I Wyll kepe the fleen with his mell In the sonne and by them dwell But he is the moost foole of all That wyll kepe his owne wyfe in thrall Of aduoutrye. ca. xxxiii. The man is folysshe and ryght obstynate That seeth his wyse in a dyssolute place Frequentynge mysrule/but her vnclene fate He wyll not se but couereth his face With his hande thorughe his fyngers space He toteth as he wolde playe bo pepe As cat for a mouse faynynge to slepe Of hym that is alwayes folysshe. xxxiiii. The peruers foole is lunatyke That thynketh to haue grete rychesse And that euery man wyll stryke Without a cause in his madnesse He is a foole without sagenesse And hathe ben one all his longe dayes And shall abyde styll so alwayes. Of angre that proceeeth of a lytell thynge. ca. xxxv.

He that thynketh to mount on hye On fortunes whele that is so peruerse He is replete with grete foly Seynge that she is so dyuerse For she wyll lyghtly hym reuerse Up so downe vnder the whele And take hym from his hertes wele. Of the impacyence in sykenes. Ca. xxxvii. yf the syke man be oppressed With maladye full anguysshous And wyll not be well counsaylled By the medecyne gracyous He is a foole vylependyous Wherfore yf he haue aduersyte He is the cause therof truely Of consultacyons to openly. ca. xxxviii. Who dothe openly his wyll shewe And setteth his gynnes to appertly One maye the daunger soone eschewe Be it a man or byrde truely For whan they knowe it they go by As who sayth we be all puruayed Wherfore the foole is euyll appayed How one ought for to be wyse/by experyence of the euylles that they se fooles commyte. ca. xxxix. Who seeth of fooles the grete ruyne And theyr fallynge downe so dadayne And wyll vnto vyces enclyne Is worthy helle for to obtayne With deuylles alwaye to remayne For he wyll not his synne amende Untyll the tyme that he must wende. Not for to haue cure of detraccyons &amp; vayne wordes of euery body. ca. xl. He is a foole ryght varyable The whiche wyll gyue faythe and credence Unto euery mannes fable Whiche are folysshe without sence And knowe they be voyde of prudence Euer reportynge false tydynges Bothe at morowe and at euynnynges. Of subsannatoures/calomnyatours and detractoures. ca. xli. The foole that casteth stones ferre After the wyse man fleenge a pace And doothe euer in that synne erre Is deuoyde clene frome all good grace For in synne resteth his solace Wherfore he wyll not ruled be By ryght reason and equyte. Of the dyspraysynge of the Ioye eternall. ca. xlii. O god how our mynde is mouable Dyshonest false and not loyall For to dysprayse god permanable Withall the courte celestyall And sette at nought his syege royall For he is a foole nothynge wyse The Ioyes of heuen for to dyspryse. Of tumulte and iangelynge ? the chyrche Capitulum. xliii. Who bereth a hauke on his hande In the chyrche walkynge vp and downe And ledeth houndes in a bande That with theyr belles make grete sowne He were better be in the towne For he letteth without delaye Bothe men and women for to praye. Of them that enclyne them voluntaryly to suffre dethe. ca. xliiii. Who that of his owne propre wyll Dothe hange hymselfe by ygnoraunce Or with a guysarme dothe hym kyll Withouten shryfte or repentaunce He is a foole at eche dystaunce So to purchase dethe eternall And so to be in tormentes fynall. Of the felycyte and payne to come/and of the delytes perpetuall. ca. xlv. Dyuers fooles do drawe the carte Full of vyces bothe daye and houre And wyll not ones to god reuerte The be so hote on theyr laboure Dommagynge euer theyr neyghboure That it is pyte for to se How enuyous they to them be. Of the euyll example of the most byggest Capitulum. xlv. If the fader do ony thynge That is euyll and vycyous Before his sone in the mornynge Be it neuer so daungerous Nor vnto hym so odyous yet he wyll put it in assaye To do the same yf that he maye. Of the voluptuousnes corporall. xlvii. Dyurs by voluptuousnes Of women the whiche be presente Be brought in to full grete dystres Forgetynge vertues excellente Of god the whiche is permanente And suffreth themselfe to be bounde In cordes as it were a hounde. Of th? that c?not hyde theyr secretes. xlviii. He that in hym hathe some secrete Let hym kepe it well in his herte And tell it no man vndyscrete Lest he of his payne be coherte And dwell euer in anguysshe smerte He is a foole for afterwarde He shall haue dolours fyerse and harde Of hym that weddeth a wyfe for to haue her rychesses. ca. xlix.
