      <field name="fulltext">VOL I. SONNET ON THE SOUND OF A BELL AT POLWHELE. Still was the glimmering mansion; when my bell I rang,—I knew not why. There was a heart My lone abstraction could define too well. I am not wont at any sound to start: The death-groan, the cold shriek, the hideous yell, Oft have I heard unshuddering! But a voice (For such it seem'd) did my lorn spirit appal, Shrill, quivering, dying in the distant hall! Oh! its familiar music erst was dear To fireside pleasure, to domestic cheer, Which bade the soul of innocence rejoice! 'Twas like an echo from the hollow tomb, Responsive to the trembling wires! A tear Restor'd my wilder'd sense amidst the sullen gloom. [These garments stored up by a Canon, forsooth] R. P. These garments stored up by a Canon, forsooth, On pegs hanging fittily, row after row, Were shining and sleek, I suppose, in their youth, Black as the jet half a century ago. And now, as some red, and some green, they are spreading Around us, as if never black they had been, From Blackheath they travel'd, I fancy, to Redding, And then the way to Turnham-Green.” Maria S. Still on similes to stumble I greet the venerable sage, And think exactly they resemble Their master in a green old age.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. SONNET, Written February 24th, between three and four in the afternoon, when the funeral procession was advancing towards Truro, and the minute bell at St. Mary's tolling:— Dunstanville! is it not the funeral knell That deepens, amidst visionary glooms, The long, long shadows of the nodding plumes, O'er “down and dell,” to where thy Fathers rest? Again—again—I hear its solemn swell, Sad monitor of frail mortality! Oh! in that sudden stillness—in that pause “Without a breath,” my bosom beats to applause That shames the shouts of millions. Every eye I hail in all that countless multitude, Set on thy Coronet—in sooth to say; Number'd on earth amongst the great and good, Be thine, in blessing others only blest, The incorruptible Crown, through Heaven's eternal day! Madam Cant to Miss Pert. “La, Aunt! how very stern you look! I don't deserve such sharp rebuke.”— Now in her teens, cried Miss—“You blame, I'm sure, what's neither sin nor shame; As if 'twere wrong to while away The evening of a winter's day Just in a little healthy hop! Sure, 'tis no harm to play at Pope! Am I an owl, condemn'd to mope? A sparrow on the lone house-top? A pelican?—How hard my case is! Forgive me, if I use your phrases. It seems I'm a conceited minx!— ‘Evil to her who evil thinks!’ Then you are always croaking—croaking, About my finery:—so provoking! Who in the world could e'er believe You'd make a fuss about a sleeve? This morning, when to tie my sandal, Coz. Greatheart stoop'd, your look was scandal. You tell me I do nought but loll, Or jerk my pretty parasol. And you attack my poor pelisse, Too good for such a flaunting niece; And next you scoffing cry, ‘So—so—ah!’ Ringing you changes on my boa; Nor cease to boar me with broad hints, As if I doated on my chintz, A present from my cousin Greatheart— At once it seems set down ‘a sweetheart!’ And next, more harassing than all, You turn and twist my Indian shawl, And rank me, with a sapient sneer, Among the beauties of Cashmeer! La! would you have me wear, like you, A satin sack, nor black nor blue, Stuck up, in stomacher and stays, The fashion of my grandame's days?” Stiff was, indeed, her bodice-busk; And her old satin was subfusk. And now, with every creature-comfort, The patent chimney of Count Rumford, The blaze, that warm'd so cheerily Her crimson carpet and settee, Her tables, chairs from wood of rose, Scents to regale her snuffy nose, From cedar boxes black as jet, In gilding bright, her cabinet; And through Venetian blinds, half-seen, The balsam, first in vernal green; And duly as the clock struck two, The relish of the high ragout, And many a spicy viand rich in The cookery of a genial kitchen; And malmsey—and perhaps cogniac! —“A little for the stomach's sake.”— With all these luxuries blest or curst, The impatient Aunt her eyebrows purs'd, And, opening wide her jallow jaws So the Cornish, jallow for yellow. For utterance in Religion's cause, (One tooth projecting—quite a tusk) With passion shook, and stunk of musk; And fluttering on the wing to pounce Fierce on her prey, exclaim'd—“Renounce Your lying vanities; and know, If you would fly from wail and woe, Shunning the world's deceitful meshes, Know what to mortify the flesh is; This very night Pope Joan abjure, And read”—she sigh'd and look'd demure— “Your Bible. This will work your cure; To read with us will much avail!”— “Yea,” cried the Niece, “to read and rail! Thus I have heard many females run themselves “out of breath.” Miss Pert indeed is not “quite up” to a volubility which is of daily occurrence. There has been a vast deal of cant in many of our recent publications. Gray's Elegy, for instance, wants Christianity. To infuse a little Christian spirit into it, a few pretty or petty stanzas have been inserted—enough to leaven the whole lump! What can be more beautiful to the true believer, than— “On some fond breast the parting soul relies; Some pious drops the closing eye requires!”” Thinks I—“Her answer's flippant—curt!— But if the Niece we name Miss Pert; Without a scruple, the old Aunt Well may we christen—Madam Cant.” [Alas! such idle hours are fled] Alas! such idle hours are fled As leave my spirit ill at ease! The watch suspended o'er my head Hangs like the sword of Damocles! [His perilous state if not resembling] His perilous state if not resembling, Still his disquietude I share; And feel in every tick with trembling The menace of the single hair! THE LAMP. Priscilla and her husband at variance about a place in the ceiling where a lamp was to be suspended. “Hang up the lamp,” Priscilla cried— “Not there,” her husband straight replied: “'Tis a wrong place—you'll have to mend it; “I like not that position; “And, dear Priscilla! your decision— “I wish you would suspend it.” “Be sure,” (she said) “Tom! Tom!—a little faster!” “Stop—if you do it in that fashion— “Hang me,” he utter'd in a passion. “Tom! do you hear? quick—quick, obey your master!” THE GOUT. When, sated with rich Caillipee, I had my claret quaff'd, good me! And scoop'd the fragrant melon; Lo! ghastlier than he whilom was, Gout, grinning on the ruby glass, Handcuff'd me like a felon! Why thus incontinently groan? His entrails almost eaten out, The Spartan utter'd not a moan.— The Spartan—oh, had not the gout! THE TARTAR. Wives are in lecturing oft so sharp, Their husbands they to ire provoke, So long on the same string they harp, In troth their scolding is no joke! Day after day Madge made a rout, On generous Port denouncing woe— “Die—die! a martyr to the gout! The Tartar The Tartar of Port wine has such an effect with me, that three or four glasses are sure to produce a fit of the gout. 'tis torments thee so.” “Too true (quoth he); but check thy tongue, That dooms me thus to die a martyr; For, whether thou art right or wrong, I'm certain I have caught [the] [a] Tartar!” The last-left Evening Primrose Of all my loved Primroses That wooed the Evening-hour, One—one alone its petals pale discloses— The last-left lingering flower. To every breeze—to every breath It feebly flits and trembles, And my frail self resembles— Just shivering into death! On an Apple-tree full of blossom, Sept. 11th Where shivering through the leafy shade September breathes a gloom, Lo! yonder apple-tree arrayed In all its vernal bloom! Say, did Pomona bid it blow At Meliora's suit? Portentous in its lovely glow, Behold forbidden fruit. Then, Meliora! with thine hair Such blossoms if thou weave; Alas! unweeting girl! beware The fate of Mother Eve. [?“'Twas my lot, ere long to roam] ?“'Twas my lot, ere long to roam A listless exile, far from home— Far from these walls that mark my birth, To rear my unambitious hearth, Where Courtenay's turrets crown the groves, And vermeil meads that Isca loves! 'Twas then on topographic lore, Some evil genius bade me pore; Borne on swift steed of keen research, Hunt out a ruin or a church,” &amp;c. [The historian tells us, that Caligula—] The historian tells us, that Caligula— But 'tis a lie, I think too big, oh la! E'en for credulity to swallow, Deem'd new creations of such force, He made a consul of his horse! Yet hath my Printer beat him hollow; That emperor's rival, Master Nichols, No doubt for admiration stickles; And (well with wonder may you stare), he Hath made my “steed” an antiquary! TRURO. Our parson, poor Karkeek, bemoan'd his plight, When stuttering Crety The coincidence of her abbreviated Christian name with Creta, is curious, and of carbone with Crowgey's coals—emitting a spark to point an epigram. made him black and white; When with the Sexton—groping blind as moles— He scarce could get a spark from Crowgey's coals; And then—when he belaboured his lean poney— Alas! “notandus Creta, an carbone?” Truro Ten-pounders. My townsmen erst were pleasant folks, From Keyhead to the Castle: At every corner cracking jokes! 'Twas one continual wassal. With no proud gait—no scowling eye, No sanctified grimaces, There was one quaint saying of old Pye, which ought to be recorded, as it may be of practical use. A clergyman offering him a burial-fee, Pye—certainly not averse to money—refused to take it. “No, no,” said he: “pig never eats pig.” Perhaps I ought not to repeat his remark, “Truro is in one respect only like the ‘Kingdom of Heaven’—‘they are neither married nor given in marriage.’” From Atty White The Town Crier, celebrated by Dr. Wolcot. to parson Pye, They all had happy faces. The merry dames—they boil'd their crocks— Crocks, or potboilers. Alluding to “No cock, no charter;” Ah! not for dolts or loons: The Corporation clung to cocks no woodcock on the 9th of October (the mayor-choosing day) incurring the forfeiture of their charter.— Their wives to macaroons. Truro was famous for macaroons. Dr. Wynne used to say, (one of our clerical fashionists, resident in London) that it were worth while to come down to Truro, for the sake of the macaroons. But now, alas! through all the streets, If Truro look around her, She shudders at a hiss, or meets The strut of a Ten-pounder. From almost every mother's son She hears some fearful rumour; And sighs to think, that scarcely one Hath either wit or humour! [Lunching with Baucis and Philemon] Lunching with Baucis and Philemon, Two strangers, each a god or demon, By no means left them in the lurch, But made their domicile a church— And dubb'd him vicar, and to bless His spouse, hail'd her a vicaress! When he, a little before Baucis Ripe for the grave—(what saith the Bard?) Was buried in his own Church-yard: Where (as the fat of parsons gross is) From an obesity so rich. There sprang up quick a bulky Beech. Just so—I told our Mayoress— An Alderman of plump address, From asthma wheezing like a priest, After a corporation-feast, Died of a surfeit, to the sorrow Of his big brethren of the borough. And where (it is by all averr'd) This corporate-body was interr'd (The story terribly appall'd her) That alder rose, which you can't span: Thus (wond'rous to relate) the alder Was once an Alder-man! [Herod the bawling brats of Bedlam] Herod the bawling brats of Bedlam Into their schoolroom drew: And many a suckling (fat as fed lamb) For peace's sake be slew. 'Twas then were hush'd the Hebrew boys All (in a dead calm) quiet! But, hark! what an unearthly noise! What shrieking! what a riot! Is it, that screaming to our cost They are let loose (oh! crimini!) (In limbo long) each little ghost— Who “flentes” were “in limine?” Virgil in his “flentes in limine primo,” &amp;c. certainly alluded to Herod's massacre!!! From Bedlam (or the shades) again Be sure it may appear odd, We thus have conjur'd back the slain, And e'en out-herod Herod! The Impromptu On hearing the Penny Magazine called the Flying Mercury. Indeed 'tis a Mercury!—with flash after flash To dazzle and blind us, how swift on the wing; A thief too, like Mercury, it steals away cash! Then may we not call it a catchpenny thing? All alert with their pennies from hamlet or cottage Lo! Deborah the gossip, and old uncle Dick! Blithe girls in full bloom and grey crones in their dotage: Not a stationer's stall but is Penny-come-quick. The old name of Falmouth, whose origin is traced to a little shop of all sorts, where pennies came in so quick, as to enrich the retailer. And conjuring his coin from the villager's purse, The Radicals, certes, themselves will confess, That, whether it be for the better or worse, Every week in a house there is one penny-less. Over mountains and moors so Philosophy flies, From the high to the low, from the meek to the mule-ish: And if all the people be thus penny-wise, The Reformers, their leaders, I'm sure, are pound-foolish. THE PARENTS TO THEIR CHILDREN ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY, 1834. O! in the oblivion of afflictions past May this new year shine happier than the last! But vain—though echoed from the lyre of Pope— Prayers without zeal, or wishes without hope! Ah vain, 'midst greetings of the season told, The salutation where the heart is cold! If gracious Heaven appease the throbs of pain, From fainting give us to ourselves again, Bid doubts that dim the vision, fleet far hence, And calm the anxieties of sick suspense; May we bow down in fervent gratitude To thee, O God, thou fountain of all good! But, if our lot be yet those ills to bear, In anguish pining, or perplex'd by care, Is it for us, poor reptiles, to repine? O righteous Father! the just doom is thine. Yet, yet remember!—many a heavy grief In mutual tenderness finds sweet relief. And say, dear children, what can more assuage Youth's wild desires, the impatience of old age, Than the kind look, the soft confiding smile, That speaks a bosom “above guilt or guile”? Than mild forbearance, ever prompt to prove The brother's and the sister's cordial love; Than heavenly harmony, that binds the whole In golden links—one body and one soul? Ah, what can more the selfish passions still Than meek submission to a parent's will; Than fond affection, sedulous to cure A parent's morbid weakness, or endure— Assiduous to sustain declining years; To chase distrust; to wipe off sorrow's tears: And, whilst the storms of life may chafe and rave, To smooth our passage to the quiet grave! THE SABBATH-EVENING WALK. The Sabbath-sunset—how serene! How pleasant all this summer-scene! A day devoutly pass'd in prayer, Unvext by any earthly care. Our path (the brooklet wandering by) We trace—“the happy Family;” And mark, as down the glimmering glade The purple hues of Evening fade, Flowers that their cups of incense close, Birds of the air that seek repose; And (darkening though the coppiced dale Faints from the sight) yon Village hail, Which high along the rock hath won To its still roofs the lingering sun; The thatch whilst golden tints disstain, Or kindle in the glittering pane, Till now the duskier shadows fall, And holy Peace hath curtain'd all. There—(as we deem, reveal'd to view, Dear to the heart the illusion true)— We fancy, with a glorious ray, Once more Emmaus lights our way! There, as the two disciples walk'd, And mournful in communion talk'd, And trembled between hope and fear, The Saviour suddenly drew near: So, seen by Faith's unclouded eye, Here I had interposed:— “Behold, he brake and blessed the bread; And doubt from every bosom fled!” but in this (to use a pictorial phrase) there would be a want of keeping. May Jesus to ourselves draw nigh! And may to us our heavenly Lord, Opening his everlasting word, “The promise of the Father give, And bid us go—believe and live! In Charles's days, the Puritans prohibited servants and children from walking in the fields on the sabbath-day. Here, also, we follow them up, pretty closely. Some of my brethren, who pretend to dislike them, tread upon their heels. [A tissue but of joy and grief] A tissue but of joy and grief, Smiles followed fast by Tears— Such Life however long or brief— Such are our chequer'd years! But oft 'tis from a carnal source The specious Smile we borrow; And shed, to damp our earthly course, The Tear of deadly “The sorrow of the world worketh death.” sorrow. O may the Smile with Heaven accord For secret sins subdued! And for thy mercies, gracious Lord! The Tear from gratitude! [Ah! who are they that have not lost] Ah! who are they that have not lost Relations they deplore; A moment we enjoy at most Friends to be seen no more. Yes! such is our frail mortal race To life that lasts for ever; 'Tis but a little moment's space, Till Death our bonds dissever! Father of Light! thy Paraclete To thy poor suppliant send, And bid him consolation meet Where sleeps his earliest friend! [Where roars the Westering surge—“Lo! Methodism] Where roars the Westering surge—“Lo! Methodism Triumphant!” cries a stormy son of schism. “It is a Hercules—say what you please— “Invincible—another Hercules!” The impression of the foot, from strength to strength, I mark—each stride was of gigantic length; And the firm foot, still firmer as it waxes, On the ??????? ????? ne'er relaxes: Oh! not the craft or skill of priest or wizard Shall bid its vestige vanish from the Lizard; And, spite of all your hissing and your hooting, Beyond the ????? we have gained a footing: Determining its progress, we exclaim, Judge from this foot—ex pede Herculem!” —Nay, nay! the further eastward as you go, Faint are the traces of a heel or toe; And trembling from weak knees and bandy legs, Your mighty giant must have trod on eggs! On pede Herculem you run a rigg may— Judging ex pede I detect a pigmy! [Peace officers! four doughty fellows!] Peace officers! four doughty fellows! So skilfully ye blow the bellows To kindle fuel into flame,— Pray, how did ye acquire the name? If, to prevent a bloody nose, The constable should interpose, So little doth he leave men quiet, He vaunts his interest in a riot. And Peace—is she well coupled, burn ye! With pettifogger or attorney, Who, whilst he bounces like a rocket, Steals six and eightpence to his pocket? And say, though he may come forth, big In all the majesty of wig, Say, will the man of wig or gown The breakers of the peace put down? Certes, he may cry out: “Ahem! “If they see ‘forte, virum quem, [Silent, stant auribus erectis”—] Silent, stant auribus erectis”— In vain. I 'll tell you what the fact is, Better than Bard or could or can, E'en though he were a Tru-Roman: Ten-pounders do not stand in awe Of any worthy of the law. To crown the whole, perhaps your trust is In an old sputtering silly justice; Who, in his dotage each poor elf Committing, oft commits himself; And, as he deems it not uncivil To send beer-tipplers to the devil, Pries into every kidlewink— The more 'tis stirr'd, the more 'twill stink! [Though here, not much renown'd for Beauty] Though here, not much renown'd for Beauty, Venus a fair-one seldom greets, Late, sedulous to do her duty, O'er three she breath'd ambrosial sweets. A soul all fancy—eye all fire, To Copinger allured the Muses; Nor did they cease or lute or lyre, Till the wild girl had caught Trefusis. But, in the cause of merit staunch, They joy'd to rescue from oblivion The melting charms of Betsy Cranch; And triumph'd when she won a Vivian. Rise, Dickenson!—eclipse them both! Shine out, and carry all before ye! Venus is happy to make oath— Thy radiant orb is Truro's glory! [“Nor Roman prow, nor daring Tyrian oar] “Nor Roman prow, nor daring Tyrian oar Ere dash'd the white wave foaming to my shore: Nor Greece nor Carthage ever spread the sail On these my seas to catch the trading gale. You, you alone have dared to plough my main, And with the human voice disturb my lonesome reign.” The Lusiad, B. V. [Lo, at long intervals, the rage is] Lo, at long intervals, the rage is The darkest countries to explore; Thus, in three very distant ages, Three voyagers traced Afric's shore. Old Egypt had her Pharo-Necho; Her Gama well may Lisbon boast; Yet is their fame a feeble echo To Lander's trump from Cornwall's coast! And we assert—nor into fiction wander— Necho and Gama vanish'd before Lander!</field>

[Whilst others wander down their dusky dells] Whilst others wander down their dusky dells, Pleas'd with the melodies of tinkling rills, Or scoop dim grots or saunter round green hills, Or climb the hedges sprent with sweet harebells, Or mark, where hamlets crown the misty vale, The plodding peasant and the milkmaid's pail;— I greet Thee midst thy mountains and thy fells, Thy sea-like lakes, thy rocks by thunders riven, Thy cataracts flashing to the effulgent Heaven! Such is thy scene of grandeur!—We, frail men, “We petty men.” —Shakspeare. Trill to the lowly grove the inglorious lay, In concert with the redbreast and the wren: 'Tis thine, with the majestic eagle's sway Soaring on rapid wing, to drink the golden day! II. [Yes! to pursue thy empyrean flight] Yes! to pursue thy empyrean flight Impetuous as the bird of Jove, be thine! Thy own Urania speeds through realms of light Thy lordly course!

Zaide, Hassan's Wife. Ellen, an English Lady engaged to Edwin. Fatima, Slave to Zaide. English, Spanish, Italian, &amp;c. Slaves. Scene.—Smyrna. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text.

A Mosque. The Morning. Hassan alone. (After offering up his orisons.) Never, O Mahomet! to meet the beams Of early day, did orison arise In all thy mosques, from a more cheerful heart Than Hassan's! I have breathed to thee the prayer Of piety and peace. And thus of guilt Unconscious, as my buoyant spirits dance, I taste thy goodness in a store of bliss, And thank thee for the treasure! It is said Past evils are as nothing—all a dream: —Not so. They leave a sensible impression, Whence we are more alive to present blessings. Not two years since, to proud Algiers (whose Dey Defied the Sultan in piratic war) I crouch'd a slave.—But hail, propitious morning! Gilding yon minarets with the same glory As just a year ago lit up my nuptials. Yes! just a year hath pass'd, (how rapidly Since I saluted thee my bride—the loveliest Of all the lovely!) Strong, in sooth, the contrast Of joy and woe! Though I'm a Mussalman True as all Smyrna boasts, yet have I only One wife, and should a second spouse disdain. Not so my neighbours; who possess, it seems, Two, three, or more, as wild desire may fill Their harems. It is well our righteous law Commands not a plurality of women: With foreigners, embracing one, my feelings, My sentiments accord. Whether that one They love, I know not. But, my dearest Zaide! In thee, my Zaide! my whole soul is center'd. SCENE II. A Breakfast-room in Hassan's House. Zaide. (Attended by several Slaves.) Why tarries yet my Hassan? To the mosque Hard by, perhaps, my lord repair'd. And, slaves! Ere—to allay the feverish heats, intenser Each moment, you have furnish'd the sherbet's Cool beverage, and refreshing fruits,—his presence I trust will gladden these expecting eyes [Slaves go out. After a long pause. How rarely have we thus asunder wooed The dawn. Perchance my ramble may amuse him! But list!—I hear his footsteps! Hassan enters. Welcome, Hassan! To us, whose pleasures rival paradise, One hour of separation were an age. I, too, beyond the precincts of the court Have stepped, as these habiliments may argue The mild air of a most delicious morning Had lured me to the terrace; whence the view Of our fine harbour never fails to charm The unsated eye. The placid silken wave With more than wonted softness seem'd to kiss The sands, now blushing to the orient light, Now sparkling golden radiance. Quick the breeze Sprang up; and as the distant billow froth'd To my excursive sight, a crowd of sail Press'd on, and every moment more distinct, Detain'd my lingering gaze. First, our own pendants To larger ships attracted observation; And next, in a variety of colours Distinguishing the ships of other climates, My fancy was afloat. Has. These, my sweet Zaide! Are captur'd vessels. With the Christian name Our warfare for a while had ceas'd: I hail'd The peaceful calm; and when again the Crescent Flash'd on the Cross defiance, from my heart I griev'd; for I shall ever hold most dear One generous Christian, who from slavery rescued— Yes! for my Zaide rescued me. No more (Though on my courtesies the Mufti frown) Shall Hassan scorn a Christian. Zai. Surely not! Why should we scorn the children of the Cross Because they have not the high privilege To know our holy prophet? Ignorance claims Compassion. Truly do I pity them— Nay love them, too! For some have gentle bosoms— All, but one wife. Has. Oft hath “the generous Christian” Awaken'd thy curiosity to learn A tale which now the golden moment bids me At length relate. Before the shrine of Allah I vow'd a solemn vow, that every year To come (if such were possible) should witness My grateful purchase of a Christian's freedom. This is our nuptial day; the brightest, Zaide, In the whole annual round. And as those vessels Are now importing slaves, Heaven hath vouchsafed How signally, to bless my gratitude! Zai. I love thy benefactor—though to see him Were a vain hope. But I can fancy features Beaming angelic goodness. Has. Yes! my Zaide! Graved is that angel image on my heart Never to be erased. Had you but seen— Whilst some were planning for deliverance, schemes In sanguine mood; and with dejected air Others stood musing;—on the floor I lay Outstretch'd. The Algerines, that guarded us, Mock'd at my sorrow; but I heeded not Their scoffs, in you absorb'd. The cooling founts That play'd beside us, to allay the heats Of feverish noon, and from o'ershadowing roses Flung odours, had no charms for me. I beat My bosom, and with agonizing sighs Deplored my destiny—when, lo! with port Manly yet unobtrusive (as he seem'd To shrink from meddling with a stranger's woes) Approach'd an European, and presumed “To hope my grief was not remediless.” Rising, I kiss'd his garment. “Cruel fate Hath snatch'd me from the mistress I adore— Far, far from her (I cried) to whom ere twice The moon could have renew'd her orb, the link Connubial had for ever join'd me. Lone Upon a foreign strand (since without her The crowded city were a wilderness) For lack of some few glittering particles— A little yellow dust—shall I expire?” His eyes o'erflow'd with tears; and with a voice Faultering from sympathy,—“Thou shalt not die For want of a few sequins. Take these pieces— And to thy country—to thy mistress go— Go, and be happy!” (cried the noble stranger) “And learn to hate no more a Christian brother.” Prostrate again I clasp'd his knees, and utter'd, O Zaide! thy enchanting name. His own I ask'd him; that his gold I might return By the first freight. “Ah no (said he) I lend not— I lend not, but I give! Excuse me, friend! That I conceal my name.” Then, too, too courteous, He grasp'd my trembling hand, nor seem'd to notice My mute embarrassment, but to the ship That hither wafted me—another Gabriel! Guided my steps, when, both in tears, we parted. Zai. May righteous Alla bless him! To a spirit So liberal, life is one rich feast of pleasure. Has. Not to disclose the story of my ransom— Not e'en to Zaide, till I could redeem My pledge, was I resolved. 'Tis secrecy That sanctifies a vow. All I could learn, Was, that my benefactor was a merchant From England, and that he was bound to Malta, Where he had left the girl of his affections— Ere this, perhaps, his bride. Zai. How she must love him! SONG. 1 In vain for me the unfeeling heart Amourous ardours would impart: Where is no generous sympathy, Can Love breathe the tender sigh? 2 But when its kindness would embrace Bounteous, all the human race, And only is in blessing blest, Love is Heaven in such a breast. 3 The bosom, if it beat not so, Trembles for itself alone! But, quick to others joy or woe Feels the world and self as one. 4 Its pity is the vernal shower Fresh to every living flower; Its love—the richer dew that glows To give new incense to the rose SCENE III. Prospect from a Viranda of the Sea. Harbour—Ships. Hassan, Zaide, Fatima. Zai. My Fatima! why so much haste? Fat. Thy neighbour The Armenian—whom we cannot but despise, (Mean wretch, that battens upon human bondage), Hath bought already half the Christian slaves, Just landed from those vessels. Has. Hail, thrice hail! The auspicious day, when I too shall set free A fellow-creature. Zai. Hassan! will a female Meet thy regard? Has. Why? what alarms my fair one? Say, dost thou fear that, influenc'd by example. Zai. No, no—the steadfastness of my affection Must rivet Hassan's. I would simply ask Whether a man thy preference claims? Has. Aye, surely. Zai. Why not a woman? Has. 'Twas a man ransom'd me. Zai. A woman loves thee. To redeem a female Were a delicious offering: it would give Like nard and frankincense, its twofold sweets To love and gratitude. Has. 'Tis true, my Zaide! Yet think how friendless—how disconsolate Is a poor man in slavery; whilst in Smyrna, Tunis, Algiers, thy sex appears but seldom An object of compassion. Female beauty Finds, everywhere, a home. Then, by thy leave, I will release a man. [Exit Hassan. Zai. Well—be it so SONG. 1 Of female slaves—O! I could cry To hear the piteous story— But—that a maid he would not buy— Why, somehow—I'm not sorry. 2 I have been told, that, at the best There's constancy in no man; And mutable is every breast, The sport of witching woman. 3 Well—my good husband—I am sure— Delights to do his duty: But might there not be some strange lure, Ah me! in a new beauty? SCENE IV. Zaide, Fatima. Zai. My husband means to celebrate this day With high festivity; and to adorn My person (beauteous to his partial eyes), Bade me, with all this gold, buy pearls and jewels! Yet a thought strikes me. 'Tis, I'm sure, a project Would please my lord. But hark—I hear a noise— 'Tis that relentless Kaled, with his slaves, Arrang'd below.—I cannot view those wretches— I cannot listen to their clanking chains! Let us retire, and I will tell thee all. Fatima (loitering behind). SONG. 1 Now, what silly fancy or idle caprice, is Just hatch'd in my mistress's brain, I can't guess! All I know is—I wish I had so many pieces: Heigho! I would buy such a beautiful dress. 2 O! then I would deck me all over with pearls, And to turban of diamond solicit applause, And, as envy or jealousy fired all the girls, My bosom would pant till it kindled the gauze. 3 And then from my locks a profusion of musk Should drop, like Arabia distilling perfumes; And amidst its cool shadows when evening grew dusk, And the aloes burnt bright to illumine the rooms, 4 I would join in the dance, and to frolicksome measures Would trip it away, like the antelope nimble; While mirth's antic train and the rosy-lipp'd pleasures In rapture should bound to the strokes of the cymbal. ACT II.— SCENE I. A square before Kaled's House; Kaled with his slaves for sale; viz. a Spaniard, a Portuguese, an Italian, an English Attorney or Solicitor, a Clergyman, a Senator, &amp;c. &amp;c. Edwin an English Merchant, and Andrew his servant. Kal. No, by the Sultan's soul, in the slave traffic So quick a market ne'er did I experience. A slave indeed— Enter Hassan, overhearing him. Well, neighbour! How goes trade? Kal. Bad, bad enough.—This is, of course, the tone. Sellers must grumble. (aside) Has. These, then, are the beings, Ill-fated, whom their fellows dare reduce Low as the grazing brute! How blest were I, Could I but ransom all! Yet, if discernment Guide my goodwill, perhaps I may select From the sad group the most deserving object. (To the Spaniard) Pardon me, friend, thy country? His proud looks Check my enquiries. (aside.) Span. I'm a gentleman From Spain. Has. The Spaniards are a high-bred race: What art thou, friend? Span. A gentleman. Has. But, say, To what profession bred? What can'st thou do? (Spaniard, sulkily.) Nothing. Has. Then am I sorry for thy chains— Chains that must gall indeed! Kal. A gentleman! Mere lumber it should seem. Has. (to the Portuguese) Thy grave demeanor And robe, have a portentous air! Who art thou? Portuguese. I am a grand Inquisitor of Lisbon. Has. Inquisitor? I know too well thy office. Inquisitor. My office and my boast is to defend Religion against heretics. Has. By poison And fire and dagger! Once I narrowly Escaped a persecuting monk like thee, Whose ghastly frown, whose menaces yet freeze My blood with horror. From the secret glooms Of subterranean chambers had he hurl'd The mandate that shrinks up the mortal heart. How numerous on the agonizing wheel Writh'd his pale victims, and in pangs expired. How many a Jew he sentenc'd to the flames! How many a Turk—how many a Christian—rued The violation of the Friday's fast In death—what unconvicted thousands died, Were vain to tell! Inquisitor. O were this infidel clime But subject to my power, I would regale Thine eyes with such a spectacle of carnage! From stakes of criminals I would light up Into a blaze the shore and the broad sea. Kal. (shrugging his shoulders.) The monster!— How shall I dispose of him? We shall be burnt alive. Has. (to the Italian.) And who art thou? Italian. A virtuoso. Has. I don't understand thee. Italian. A connoisseur in the fine arts. Of pictures, Cameos, statues, coins—I fix the value With nice precision. To the instrument I likewise sing melodiously. My warblings To operas could attract enamoured throngs. Has. I fancy thou art doubly qualified, Fit to amuse our harems or to guard them. (To the Solicitor) Thy calling, friend? Solicitor. The law. Has. How? What? (The Solicitor looks sly, and is silent.) The Clergyman interposing. Thy tongue I have heard voluble enough, though now 'Tis closed in silence. (Turning to Hassan,) Sir, his business Is to examine with a prying eye His neighbour's property; to give advice To clients, and for every word of counsel To pocket clinkers; to sow all around him The seeds of variance; e'en in desperate cases To promise sure success: whoe'er may gain The victory, he gets cash. Has. But, dost thou lend In every case thy services to all? Solicitor. The law, Sir, is for all. Has. I see thy meaning. The law it seems, thou canst distort at will, To suit thy client. The Clergyman. Such is his adroitness. Has. (Turning to the Clergyman.) Well, Sir! and may I now presume to ask In candour that thou tell me— The Solicitor (eagerly). What he is? A revolutionist; who against marriage (Obedient to a senator, his patron,) Publish'd a treatise to disgrace the Church; Who bowing to his master's nod, hath wrested Babes from their parents, like another Spartan, And all in one hot seminary planted The blighted sucklings; who from schools to boroughs Runs maddening, and to schools runs back again In his reforming rage!—Such be assured, Such is the hallow'd minister, whose works The trump of Fame proclaims as patriotic. But to the senator I leave the task Of blazoning his own merits. The Senator. I—I—I Has. (turning abruptly to Andrew in contempt of the Senator.) Thy honest face and rude simplicity Plead strongly for thee. Who art thou? And. No claim To thy regards have I—a labourer's son, Brought up to labour. Kal Aye, and all the others Weigh'd against thee, would kick the beam. And. Of late A master I have served, whose destiny Is a poor recompense for all his goodness. Has. Thou, too, art British, I perceive. With faults To cloud their virtues, still I reckon Britons (Maugre solicitors and patriots) foremost In kind humanity.—Thou shalt be free. And. Good Mussulman! if thou vouchsafe to Britons Thy favour, there is one deserves it well. I have no parents to require my succour; No wife; no children. Long inured to hardships Pity me not, but ransom my poor master. Has. What do I hear?—Thy master, noble slave. Where is thy master? And. There, beneath the weight Of sorrow sunk indeed. Has. Then, let him speak— But O! his griefs are sacred, and would seek Concealment. (he pauses and looks at Edwin.) Allah! righteous Allah! whom Whom do I see?—No—I am not mistaken! He, he himself, my Christian friend, who snatched me From slavery and from death! (embraces him.) Kal. Ho! ho! 'tis well— The English have a proverb—“Love or money.”— But Kaled can link love and cash together! Kind couple, every hug shall cost a sequin! Yes, they are dear embraces. (aside) Has. My best friend! (again embracing.) Kal. A friend! why yes, a friend is of great price. A rare commodity! Has. How wonderful This incident! Know, I had vow'd a vow To emancipate each year a Christian slave, In memory of thine image—of thy goodness! Hither I hasten'd to fulfil that vow, And lo!—thyself— Ed. O, my misfortunes! Has. All— They are all gone, if Hassan can disperse them. Kaled, thy price? Kal. Five hundred sequins Has. Well! I would not grudge a million! (giving him the money) Ed. Godlike spirit! Kal. Now, by my mother's scalp, fool, fool am I! (aside.) Has. Leave us together, Kaled. 'Tis but right I should enjoy my benefactor's presence. Kal. 'Tis just, for he is thine—follow me, slaves. And. (to his master) Adieu, my master! Ed. Hassan, this good servant— But can I ask? Has. Pardon my heedless haste— Here, Kaled (offering him money). Kal. No—a servant so devoted, And not a gentleman, is worth his weight In gold. Has. Two hundred sequins—say what more Dost thou expect? (giving him money.) Kal. (aside) How prodigal of wealth Perhaps—it just occurs, a lucky thought— Some tale of wretchedness—some doleful ditty May touch his woman-heart. Hassan! I'm sure (aside.) If that Italian prompt to warble airs So languishingly sweet, moved not thy pity; The Spaniard—woe begone— Has. I see thine aim, But cannot ransom all. Kal. Most readily, I'll lose one half. Has. Impossible! Kal. Away, then— SONG.—Kaled. Off, supple Solicitor! And Mr. Inquisitor! Seize the poor squeaking eunuch—go, pounce on the sinner; And thou do-nothing Don! And thou—many in one— Baby-Stealer And Dealer:— To your cells begone quickly—I haste to my dinner [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Turret and Garden below. SONG. (From the Turret, by a Female Captive, to her Harp.) 1 Amidst this murky tower, Shall Hope yet gild the hour, And Fancy's glowing visions round me rise? Alas! if Hope illume, Or Fancy chase the gloom, Appall'd by wan Despair, how soon each phantom flies. 2 In every fairy dream My dancing spirits seem Thro' gay green meads—my native haunts—to rove! Then, clasp'd in his fond arms, I yield my virgin charms To all the chaste delights of wedded love. 3 Ye dear illusions, stay— But fast ye faint away! I see him droop, the unpitying tyrant's slave. No more in rapturous trance To meet my kindling glance, He grasps, ah cold embrace! the shadows of the grave! 4 For me—relentless Fate! Ere purple pomp await The rude caresses of some Turkish lord, May this lorn turret dark Quench my last living spark— O ne'er to light again, to balmy light restored! 5 Then, midst my murky tower Shall Hope yet gild the hour, And Fancy's glowing visions round me rise? Alas! if Hope illume— Or Fancy chase the gloom, Appall'd by wan Despair, how soon each phantom flies. SONG. By Zaide, in answer to the Captive's Song, which she overheard from the Garden below the Tower. 1 Whitening with bloom the bank beneath, That silver almond seems in sighs To whisper, as the Zephyrs breathe, How fast its fleeting blossom dies! 2 The plaintive bird from yonder spray Bends o'er the rose's blushing leaf: And gentle Pity fain would say, She chaunts some tale of widowed grief. 3 But 'tis not love inspires the tones That melt amidst the warbling shade, Or to the breath of Zephyr moans Where fast the silver almonds fade. 4 Yet, in the turret-glooms above, From some complaining Captive part Sighs—that, alas! but serve to prove Their source is sorrow of the heart. SCENE III. Enter Hamet, in a violent hurry. Ham. Kaled! Take back Thy slave, or to the Cady! That Senator, Sir Simon!—Take, Sir, take him— Give me my money. He has sown sedition Already in my harem. Through one girl Who from my flexible—too trusting fondness Much freedom had enjoy'd, he gain'd access To others, ere an hour had pass'd! Away With thy complaints—the Cady, be assured, Will do me justice. SCENE IV. The Tower at distance. Hamet. Kaled, introducing Ellen, an English Lady. SONG.—Hamet. 1 Of females I have such a store, I scarcely want a mistress more! Then if she be a high-priced lady, I must betake me to the Cady. 2 Egypt gives maids to my caresses With large black eyes and ebon tresses, That o'er their bosoms hang so shady.— I'll go at once, then, to the Cady. 3 From Araby such lovely bloom, And breath, like its own rich perfume— Sweet as the balsam of Engedi! I must away, then, to the Cady. 4 And of Circassians all so fair— With azure eyes and golden hair, Be sure I have enough already!— I'm off, this instant to the Cady. 5 Yet stay.—In her may Hamet get The pleasure of a brisk brunette! And all disputes this lively lady May settle—better than the Cady. SONG.—Kaled. 1 By the roof of Heaven! To thee There's nothing like variety! Stock like thine one seldom see'th— Pretty girls with laughing teeth 2 White as hailstones in the breaches; Cheeks of down like melting peaches; Locks like scorpions all so curly; (Oh my brain runs hurly-burly). 3 But in all the virgin-trade. Never did I buy a maid, Or, Sir!—may I bear the blame! sell Sweet as this surpassing damsel! 4 What a prize to thee I tender!— Shape, as any pinetree slender; Fine expression, like the gazelle, (lifting her veil.) From her lovely eyes of hazel; 5 Lashes dark her eyelids fringing, And her cheeks carnation tinging; Such a sunny, sweet complexion Claims thy humble genuflexion! El. O England! Oh! my country! Ham. Hoh! hoh! a patriotic lady! I'm off this instant to the Cady! [Exit. Enter Ali. Ali. The Prophet bless thee! Hast thou a good choice Of virgin captives? Kal. Caitiff!—not for thee. Ali. Is she the female, who in yonder tower Was prisoned? Kal. Yes. But e'en thy master's purse Were vainly emptied to redeem a virgin Born for seraglios. Not eight hundred sequins Would purchase her. Ali. Unveil her, Kaled. Kal. (starting) What! Dost thou presume—How lucky, by my mother's— My mother's hairy scalp—how lucky I! (aside) Behold her, as I lift the vale that shades Her beauties like the eyelids of the morning. (Kaled has caught the cant!) (aside.) Thro' opening clouds! A misty morning, by the bye! Wipe off Thy tears! Ali. A Christian! Yet I pity her! I offer thee five hundred sequins. Kal. No— Her price is eight. Ali. (giving Kaled the money.) Say not who purchased her. Kal. Don't kill thyself, sweet mourner! from the vapours, After the fashion of thy country. [Ex. all but Kaled. Oh! My bowels yearn'd within me. But these shiners— Delicious opiates! They have power to still Pity's commotions—aye, to quiet conscience! ACT III.— SCENE I. Hassan's Garden. Hassan. Edwin. Has. Friend! for thy greeting I reserve my Zaide, (Her who is mine—mine only by thy goodness) Till, soon at our high bridal feast, she burst Upon thy sight “the fairest among women.” Meantime, I would fain ask, tho' my tongue falters, Where is thy lady, whom from Malta's isle —Forgive me! I intrude upon thy sorrows. Ed. Lost!—lost, I fear for ever. Has. How, my friend? Ed. Together were we taken, and this morning Were landed. Has. Hah!—And did the base Armenian Purchase her also? Ed. Aye. Has. Then from his fangs To rescue her, I fly. Ed. My Hassan!—Oh! (opprest with gratitude) SCENE II. A Moonlight Harbour in Hassan's Garden. Edwin alone. SONG. 1 Fly, fly, my godlike Hassan! Since none (thy actions prove) Pure honour thee surpass in. O bring me back my love! 2 I fear, some dire despoiler May rifle all her charms; But nought on earth can soil her— Oh, give her to my arms! 3 Tho' Freedom's orb hath risen, To fling a gleam on me; Yet is the world a prison, My Ellen! without thee. Enter Zaide. Zai. If I intrude upon thee, gentle stranger! My fault is gratitude. To thee I owe My all of life. Ed. Hail, thou beloved of Hassan! SONG.—Zaide. 1 They told me, when my love was gone, And drooping low, I wept alone; Suffused with moisture, eyes so blue Were like two violets bathed in dew; And, as my cheeks did tears disstain, They were as lilies wet with rain. 2 Ah! the big drops had—sooth to say— Well nigh the violet wash'd away; And, rains too heavily descending, The lilies from their stalks were bending: But the sun beam'd—the storm was o'er— And all was brighter than before. 3 Thou wert that sun! Thy friendly power Illumes with joy the genial hour; I welcome in that open smile A courteous spirit free from guile: Take, O my heart's warm wishes take;— I love thee for my Hassan's sake! Stranger!—in proof of my confiding friendship, To thee, as to a brother, I unveil me! But hark, my friend! Amidst the leaves I hear A rustling as of footsteps!—We must part!— Yet would I whisper to thee some glad tidings. (still more alarmed, they draw closer.) Ed. O let me clasp thee—fold thee in my arms And thus— (kissing her.) Zai. Sir! Sir! forbear!—But I suppose Such is the custom of thy country!—Hark! Some listener still!—Farewell, my gentle stranger! [Exit. SCENE IV. Hassan's own Chamber. Hassan alone. Alas! the morning rose and promised pleasure! But oh! malignant, thro' yon dark-red cloud I see pale disappointment and despair. I hasten'd—on the wings of Hope I hasten'd To ransom the betrothed of him, whom falsely I deem'd my friend! But she was gone. A chill Of terror froze my veins. Home I return'd; And hearing Zaide had prepared no dresses To grace the festal moments fast approaching, With strange misgivings sought the bower. O Allah! What stayed the avenging arm? I could have rush'd Upon the murmuring paramours, and plung'd Into their faithless hearts this thirsty sabre! But my whole frame was palsied. Like a coward, Struck by blood-guiltiness, I slank away, And to my chamber fled to catch dishonour Blushing from yon connubial couch. But, Hassan! Meet her!—If resolution strengthen not Thy trembling arm, despair shall give it vigour! The Curtain Drops. SCENE V. A magnificent Saloon. Hassan, Zaide. Has. My brain is fired! No—no—it could not be —It was delirium all! Not adjurations Heap'd upon adjurations, should persuade me That thou wert false.—Yet where were Hassan's senses? Did I not see thee, through the conscious foliage, That seem'd to drink up the whole lunar radiance, To throw a broader light on thy adultery; Did I not see thee all thy charms disclose To feed his fierce desires?—Did I not hear thee Whisper the softness of thy sighs, to sighs That melted into thine. And—O perdition! Did I not see that burning kiss, that sealed Thy perjury, wicked woman? Yes! I heard, too, Thy lovesick fond apology, fair trait'ress! 'Twas but a custom of the charming English— An innocent English custom! Yet to thee It seem'd no novelty at all! 'Tis true A higher colour kindled up thy cheeks; But 'twas the feverish flush that only spoke A keener relish of forbidden pleasures! An English custom! Yes? And I suppose To lavish all upon a specious stranger— All that a poor duped husband had design'd In honest pride, for nuptial decorations; —This, also, is an innocent English custom! [Enter a Female in a Turkish dress, veil, &amp;c. &amp;c. But who comes hither! What! Dost thou insult me, Scorn me?—O agony! Still, still this sabre— [While he bites his lips in agony, and brandishes his sabre, Zaide sings in an affectedly insulting air. SONG.—Zaide. 1 Lord and Master! yet withhold, Stay the sabre from my blood! Yes! my Master, what is gold— Gold—to love and gratitude? 2 Aye—for him I spent my treasure; Why—oh, why this jealous mood? Is there any earthly pleasure Without love and gratitude? 3 Thou, with all the diamond's splendour, Bad'st the bride her form obtrude; But what value would it lend her— Without love and gratitude? 4 'Twas for him I scorn'd each jewel— Pearls nor gems would passion prove! Spare—O spare me—though so cruel, I resign them all—for love! Has. Cease, cease thy mockery. Hither slaves conduct Her paramour— (Edwin is introduced.) —Know, stranger! thou art punish'd Too justly! 'Tis a righteous retribution!— Thy mistress is no more—to thee at least For ever lost!— [Whilst he is speaking, the veiled Lady rushes into Edwin's arms. Ed. O Ellen! El. O my Edwin. (she faints in his arms.) Zai. (after a long pause, in a tone of conscious elevation) See, Hassan! see—for toys that idly glitter, A worthier offering to the gentle powers Of love and gratitude. It is thy gift. El. (recovering and falling at Zaide's feet.) Madam! I owe thee more than worlds—my life My love! Zai. The debt is mine, To thy betrothed I owe my husband. Has. O mysterious heaven! Zai. Hassan, thy story of the Female Captive From Edwin torn, no sooner reached my ears, Than I determined with thy gold to purchase And at the feast present her—sweet surprise— To my dear husband! How my heart exulted! Flush'd with success, I to the garden flew And whisper'd to the stranger—oh, too rashly— The happy tidings. Hence the unlicens'd transport That well might raise alarms e'en in thy bosom, Ingenuous as thou art. I was too ardent— Unthinking—but I know thou wilt forgive me. Has. Forgive thee, Zaide! I have truly cause To ask from thee forgiveness. Shame upon me— Shame—that my mean suspicion should have clouded One moment of this golden day! I see thee Unspotted purity—angelic goodness! But I can only ask my Zaide's pardon. (they embrace.) [hand in hand, she sings.] SONG.—Zaide. 1 O too lightly I, this morn, Boasting of our peerless joys, Said, as if in impious scorn, They were those of Paradise. 2 Much I fear, the Prophet's power, To avenge his slighted name, Sent me to the garden-bower,— Smote thee with a jealous flame. 3 Then, more modest let us bear Whilst on earth, our earthly joys We are, sure, the happiest pair— Only—not in Paradise!

The Hall of Audience. The Chamberlain Calou; the British Ambassadors, Edred and Bishop Sigelin. Cal. Hail! legates of illustrious worth, all hail! Ye, who, adventurous from the extremer isles— From Albion's seat of glory, come; to greet The Brother of the Sun. Our friendly harbours Have hush'd their waves; our cities have flung back Their brazen gates, that ye may enter, proud In princely state! And lo, the lofty throne, Emulous to which the nations of the earth Bow down, shall to your cherish'd sight reveal Our patriarchal monarch! (The Ambassadors presenting their offerings in honour of the King and of St. Thomas to Calou the chamberlain; a door opens at the back of the throne, and (the King of Malayala) Beliarte comes forward. Bel. Peace be with you— Honour and peace, high strangers! who have sought us From afar off, o'er a long billowy waste! How fares our brother of the western world? Ed. Our mighty Alfred, in the name of him The Apostolic saint who guards these shores, To thee presents his cordial salutations. For what remains, O King! we would solicit Thy private ear. (The scene closes; the King intimating his assent.) SCENE II. A Balcony of the Palace; commanding a view of the Sea-shore, and of the British Ships. Beliarte. Edred. Sigelin. Ed. See those red pendants, flashing The radiance of the closing day. They stream O'er valiant spirits! Behold the British Merchant, Though bosom'd in the hospitable haven, “Alfred ordered a good number of merchant ships to be built. And it is affirmed, that some of the merchants traded as far as the East Indies; whence they imported several things before unknown to the English.” —Rapin's Hist. of England, fol. p. 95. In a note, Rapin says: “It is not likely they traded to the Indies by sea, at a time the mariner's compass was not found out.” According to Malmesbury and Spelman: “He sent a present to the Indies, in honour of St. Thomas. Sigelin, Bishop of Sherburn, was employed to deliver it; who performed the voyage successfully, and brought back precious stones, perfumes, and other commodities which were then great curiosities in England. It was thought, Alfred caused with these diamonds a more august and imperial sort of crown than had been used before, to be composed; for, in the arched roof in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, (where the ancient regalia of the kingdom are kept,) upon a box, the cabinet of the most ancient crown, there are these words:—“Hic est principalior corona, cum quâ coronabantur reges Alfredus, Edwardus,” &amp;c.—This crown is of a very ancient work, with flowers adorned with stones of somewhat plain setting.—See, in particular, Spelman's Life of Alfred, lib. ii. c. 28. In the Saxon Chronicle, I find this short notice: Ann. 883. Hoc anno detulerant Sighelmus et Æthelstanus eleemosunas (quas Ælfredus rex eo se missurum voverat) in Indiam, ad Sanctum Thomam et Sanctum Bartholomeum.” With respect to the Syrian Christians, see Buchanan and other writers. That they are of the first antiquity and of the true Episcopalian Church, there is not the shadow of a doubt. It is most devoutly to be wished, that Bishop Sigelin's prophecy, at the close of this dramatic sketch, may be realized.— Heber, the late Bishop of Calcutta, was not like Middleton, a frigid calculator of probabilities. I trust, he hath opened to good purpose, an intercourse with the Syrian Christians. Yet knows to poise the lance, or wield the sabre. If then the prowess of the British seaman Thou wish to witness; straight our trumpeters Shall summon up our little troop around thee: And they shall stand, a stubborn force—a wall Impregnable to Brahman arts or arms— To Brahman incantation! Sig. Say, O King! Dost thou not see the interposing hand Of Providence, that wafted at this crisis Our vessels to thy coasts? Great Alfred, anxious To bind the genuine children of the Cross, Though scatter'd over distant climes, in union With Albion's gifted race, and first of all The followers of the martyr'd Saint—dispatch'd us, To do right homage at thy throne and altar. But, of the jarring interests of thy kingdom, The temper or the bias of thy court, Thy household, unapprized (what now thy goodness Confides to generous bosoms) lo, we sail'd The unconscious instruments of Heaven, to 'stablish, Haply, thy Church upon a broader basis. Bel. The heavenly character of our Apostle, His meek demeanour, yet his steadfastness And intrepidity, inspire, confirm Our fickle minds. With wonder we look back Upon the crowds his preaching gather'd round him, And fix'd, the adorers of the one true God! What thousands he led converts to the faith; Rearing fair structures for the worshippers On inland mounts, in groves, along the shore; Till they, whose jealousy had ey'd askance, His triumphs o'er their pagods, and had watch'd The silent moments of his meditations, Broke in upon his privacy, assail'd With stones his sacred person, and the lance Of Kytoo through his body thrust, remorseless Murderers! 'Twas here, at his own Malabar, His favourite fabric had he built: here rests The saint in slumbers undisturb'd. His tomb, His memory, we revere; his little flock To save from persecution is our aim; Though for a full profession of our faith, The hour is not yet come. Sig. I see that hour! I welcome its approach, and recognize The mandate from the heaven of heavens, that sent us An embassage of high desert, from darkness That may be felt to free thy suffering people; And in their great deliverance to exalt them The chief among the Christian nations. SCENE III. The Queen's Cabinet. Queen Serinda. Amanda Rayer, the Brahman, her Counsellor. Ser. Say— Is Saib on the march? Who warn'd the prince Of this impending danger? Were our heralds Charg'd with the tale of fleets from northern regions, Fleets bearing on their wings the sons of giants? And was he told, that girt with swords of flame, And cased with adamant, each warrior tower'd A champion of St. Thomas? Aman. If we read The auguries of the skies aright, Prince Saib Encircled by a numerous host, draws near. Ser. And hath thy secret messenger been taught To set forth Theodora's ripening charms, Her brilliant beauty, to reward the achievement, When he shall rise, terrific, on the ruins Of Syrian churches? Aman. Rather to our fanes, Aye, rather, when Prince Saib shall restore Their still mysterious gloom, their deep repose! Ser. Such, such is thy eternal cant. The picture Of tranquil votaries may perhaps amuse thee, And win thy fancy to its placid features— But the dread Deity that hush'd our temples Far off retires, whilst in each avenue Those licens'd scoffers of St. Thomas, jostle The mild Gentoo! Go—bid the Nazarite Eschew his vanities, give up his baubles, His precious stones and garments! Go, reduce The Prelate to his pristine simple state,— To saintlike self-abasement! Then observe His flock—go number them! The Cross, perchance, (Erected kindly, to refresh, to heal The fainting multitudes that press around it,) Hath virtues to evaporate all in air! ACT II.— SCENE I. The Queen's Apartment. Serinda. Hirab, her confidential female attendant. Ser. And is it thus our scorn'd divinities Are in the dust laid low? On every height Reddens They were built of brick. the recent fabric, to insult The kindling morn! To bells, to crashing bells Quake our dejected altars; whilst to vestments Milk-white our Brahmans vail their ancient honours. Alas! the court hath caught the strange contagion, This Syrian malady! E'en our old king Droops from its influence. But by Vishnu's might, I will avenge me of that guilty maiden, Nor suffer her stolen loves to blast the country As with a pestilence. To Asgar's fane, Hirab! thy cunning or thy care did trace The son of that proud prelate? Thou didst see Endearments and caresses? Thou didst witness Soft amorous murmurs, vows of constancy, And all such sights and sounds? Hir. Alas! too true! Yes, with these eyes I saw the fond embrace; Yes, with these ears I witness'd all that love Could utter, in its most impassion'd moments. Of furtive interviews the busy rumour Was whisper'd round. To please my royal mistress, I was resolv'd to watch in all her movements The princess, and, if just the sad suspicion, To tell thee all. 'Twas yester eve the sun Its last rays beaming on the temple-roof, A dark cloud quench'd the gilded balls in shadow; 'Twas then, from where a palm its duskier gloom Flung o'er the bank, I heard a stealthy step, A rustling, a short breathing, sighs half-smother'd; And—screen'd by the hoar broken wall—espied Distinctly through its fracture, two fair forms Ascending up the temple. On a sudden They stopp'd: and “We must part” he cried, “my love: I fear some lurking caitiff. But to-morrow, Yon moon arising over Isbad's grove, There will we meet again!” Quick through the darkness, To penetrate the deep recess, she look'd Shivering with apprehension. Not the roe Close by the lair of the gaunt lioness From terror trembles more. Ser. And she shall tremble! E'en as the roe when the gaunt lioness Hath seized, and torn its reeking limbs asunder! Enough, enough! My emissaries, punctual To all appointments, loveless or lovelorn, Shall hail “the rising moon o'er Isbad's grove.” Hir. Yet, as I noticed their ingenuous ardour, Though indiscreet, ingenuous—from my heart I pitied errors which thy chastening hand May still correct in mercy. Oh! my queen! She was all loveliness. Her veil thrown backward, Light wanderer from amidst her chesnut hair A ringlet kiss'd the roses of her cheek; But in her eyes, that wont in melting lustre To languish, there was wildness from her fears. Feeble and pale she totter'd. In mid azure, The silver-skirted cloud that scarce before Stole on, so quivers to the whirling wind; And, calm again, its soft dissolving texture In evening's vivid crimson disappears! Thus all in blushes—yet one little moment Clasp'd in her lover's arms—she fled! How high In grandeur, and in grace, that princely stature! When motionless he gazed, till she was gone, And still upon her pathway gazed,—her pathway Where seem'd to float a glory long behind her, A trail of light left only by the gods! O! they were forms—not Shivah's self— Ser. Avaunt; Blaspheming girl! To thy mad poesy (Nurs'd as thou wert amidst Ellora's bards) Oft have I loved to listen. But thy tongue Runs strangely rampant. To his fiery wrath— To him thy flippancy presum'd to name, Devoted, shall they perish! Hence, away! SCENE II. Beliarte. Serinda. Bel. Wife of my fondest love—thou, on whose bosom, Careworn and sinking from the weight of years I wooed repose;—say, why is thy young brow Thus ruffled? Why with such a glance of anger, Thus greet thy lord? Ser. Gods! Is there not a cause? Dost thou not foster with ill-omen'd kindness The spawn of Antioch? Have I not repeated My solemn warnings, as I bid thee mark Thy Theodora's ways? In soften'd tones, Soften'd to sooth thy partial ear, her wanderings Have I not oft described? And though I touch'd Lenient upon her frailties, lest too harsh I should offend thee (strenuous to restore To its pure spotlessness her blemish'd fame), Hath not my mild expression been repuls'd By silence, or the impatience that ill brooks A story of detraction? I could tell thee Of midnight assignations—I could tell thee, How oft “the bower of cassia” then unpierc'd But by the starry lights of heaven, hath wrapp'd Her love-thefts in its solitary shade;— How oft “the ruin'd fane” frowns o'er her pleasures. Yes! I could tell thee where apostacy From lewd voluptuousness hath snatch'd new fuel, Whilst to the daring son of Dionysius She hath abandon'd honour, truth, and conscience. And dost thou sanction still th' incontinence, The faithlessness of that rebellious damsel, And yet not shudder at Narenha's gulf? Dost thou not feel thy throne rock under thee? Ere long, that throne shall crumble into atoms. Bel. Oh! check thy frantic zeal. The gods of India Prompt not religious vengeance. Ask thy Brahman, Thy counsellor. His fluent eloquence Hath said, that “soft as ripples o'er the sands The sacred wave, is Maya's genial smile,” And that “her shrine is only rich with incense Where mercy breathes.” Ser. But hath thy Syrian Princess (For she had birth, it seems, midst crowns and sceptres) A claim to Mercy? Is the blood of kings, That riots like the dancing prostitute's, And makes such tumult in thy virgin's veins, No unpolluted current? Why that look Incredulous? I thank thee for thy musings,— I thank thee for the thought that clouds thy brow, Still gathering to reproach the false accuser! But I will bring the lovers full before thee! I will produce Diophanes, and shew To garish day the votary of the shadows, Confronted with his blushing Theodora! Yes, Theodora! Yes! her very name Impregnated with evil, bears within it Disasters dire, and prodigies and crimes! [Exit. Bel. (alone) I must dissemble. Yet the unvalued time, The golden moment, doubtless, is not distant, When, shielded by the British embassage, I may avow my faith. To fair Arisbe, Sprung from the kings of Antioch's holy city, I owe that light which, as the day-star, rises All in my troubled heart, with friendly lustre, To calm it into peace. To her I promis'd When we exchang'd the vows of married love, Protection to her poor unconscious infant. And when—alas! how soon!—from her faint pillow She lifted up her sweet imploring eyes, I promised more. “O, if thou ever loved Thy poor Arisbe, take (she cried) her image, Take to thy guardian care. And oh! remember, In Theodora I bequeath to thee A princess and a Christian!”—To my tears— My vows—as to my trembling arms I caught The little weeping innocent, the smile That lighted up Arisbe's countenance Was Heaven itself! Sure, to the parting Christian Death hath no sting! But, what a weak old man! Why did I take Serinda to my bosom? Why did I lead, to please my Pagan consort, To Vishnu's shrines the unwitting Theodora? Why to the favour of the idolatrous tribes Commend my lisping worshipper?—asham'd Of Him who said: “Suffer the little children To come to me—for their inheritance Is Heaven—theirs is my kingdom!” As I strive With frequent efforts, to renounce my errors, Her passions overwhelm me! I could deem it Well nigh enchantment that chains up my will! All fancy and all fire, her violence Distracts me e'en to dizziness! To break That spell, the couch alone from which I drew Faith that shall cherish the last hour, availeth: 'Tis from the dying couch hath beam'd forth comfort That shall outlive the Shaster's vain illusions. SCENE III. A Portico. The King. The Queen. Soldiers enter and relate their fruitless search after Diophanes, &amp;c. Ser. What! felons! If they have escaped, your lives— Your forfeit lives—for perfidy shall pay Due recompence!— Soldiers. O Queen! Amid the shade Of tamarinds, breathing scarce a breath, we lay Hour after hour, and every leaf around us Seem'd fearful to disturb the moonlight stillness; When, lo! a sudden rush and a long roar Shook all the grove. Starting we bent our bows, Starting as by involuntary impulse! Sedulous the spot we travers'd, and descried A tiger's track, and with fresh gore imbrued The sands that sloped away. Ser. But found ye not The dead or dying? Soldiers. Busied in the search We left some few bold spearmen, and hied home To tell thee what had happen'd, and to wait Thy further pleasure. Not that the stained sands Were tinctured from the lacerated princess, Or from the son of holy Dionysius! Hard by a traveller had just pass'd. Perchance The tiger— Ser. Wretches! Ye but ill conceal Your bias. Ye but mock at me! Yet know Though all things visible combine against me, I have a thousand viewless powers, that hover Above your craven heads, and at my nod Descending— Bel. Are ye sure that Theodora This evening sought the tamarind grove? Ser. Aye, sure— And I presume, ere she had saunter'd long, The jungle was her prison, and her goaler And executioner (both met in one) The griesly minister of Indra. [Theodora enters. Bel. Thanks! O God, to thy all gracious power, she lives! Ser. So! neither man nor beast hath clue to thread The mazes of thy ramblings! (with a mad malicious laugh.) —But rash maid! Thy lover hath, ere this, fallen headlong down The precipice, to which thine harlotry Had his rash steps seduc'd! And thou, grey monarch! Thou half Hindoo, who gazest now on me, Now on thy Theodora; some new likeness— Some new expression of her lovely mother; Be sure, thou hast discern'd! Her gentleness, Her melting air, the lilies of her face, And o'er her bosom's bloom, those wanton tresses Are imaged all before thee! What am I? My sable charms? Once, if a quick blush redden'd My black complexion, 'twas the beauteous coral That colour'd, from beneath, the liquid wave! 'Twere now, a fire-gleam through the duskiness Of murky midnight! Thou couldst once admire The silky softness of my skin, and praise In me a symmetry of form and features Surpassing all. Once, it is true, my teeth Were as the pearls of Ormuz! Once, these eyes Could kindle up thine impotence to rapture! 'Tis past! They shine no more:—or, if they shine, Their brightest beam is but—“a glance of anger.” ACT III.— SCENE I. A Dungeon in the Palace. Diophanes in Chains. At dead of night, an iron door unclosing, enter Theodora. Theo. Hasten, adored Diophanes! Those chains We will unlink, and disappoint the poniard That thirsts relentless for thy life! I fear Death will be busy midst these walls anon! And oh! a thought—an agonizing thought, Which I have idly struggled to discard, Is forc'd on me, as if by some bad spirit Infusing ill! Yet can there breathe on earth A monster so unearthly? But just now, Our sovereign, to recruit his languid frame, (The Brahman so advised and so averr'd,) From Rayer's hands a sparkling goblet took, And drank It seem'd a balmy draught. Serinda Stood by, and—so I construed—scarce disguised The pleasure of a fiend! I caught her eye's Malicious twinkling. Oh! I dread the treachery Of that smooth Brahman, whom (Serinda's minion) The king too confidently trusts—“the friend, The royal counsellor, the sage Physician! Alas! Heaven pardon me, if I suspect— The prisoner! Straight to Calou, (by whose aidance I enter here,) I hinted my suspicion.— But my lamp quivers almost to extinction. Haste, haste away. Dio. My Theodora! listen! Thy precious life for me hast thou abandoned! I fear thou art betrayed and lost. Hark, hark! Low muttering voices. Vainly would we fly! The massy doors close heavily upon us: The bolts roll back into their iron places. But summon all thy fortitude, my fair one! Angel of light! The fiends—they cannot hurt thee! SCENE II. Beliarte. Dionysius. Calou. Bel. Too true! The signet of thy pliant sovereign Hath been abused indeed! But wiles and witchcraft Possess my palace. Yet if loyalty, If ancient faith, averse from usurpation, Still linger in one being here, thy son Is free. Cal. Enough, enough my royal master! The fleeting night hath warn'd thee to retire To thy accustom'd slumbers. Cares press hard— Too hard upon thee; and thy reverend age Is sunk in sorrow. Let my arm sustain thee. SCENE III. The King's Bedchamber. Beliarte. Diophanes. Theodora. Bel. Come hither, O, my child!—I would fain say My children! For a few short minutes loosed From durance so unmerited, to attend My dying admonitions, and to hear The adieus of tried sincerity—the blessings Of friendship, of a parent's love, I call'd you. My honest chamberlain (to whom your thanks For this brief respite from your prison bonds Are due) hath power, hath a determined spirit Which shall break forth ('tis now rein'd in discreetly) To vanquish all your enemies. A tone Is his, a majesty of speech, a grandeur Of sentiment, a high commanding mien, From which the conscious villain shrinks aghast. But to your dungeon tho' sent back, and menac'd With every torture of protracted death, Be firm, my children! Your Almighty Parent Shall from the lion's mouth deliver you, If it seem meet to His unerring wisdom. Rich from the canopy that long hath shaded The royal progeny of Malayala, The Christian ensign may shine out emblazon'd, Ere many a moon shall wane: and you, my children, Who droop afflicted now, may sit beneath it, Sceptred in glory! To my swimming eyes The vision of such glory opens, fresh From Heaven's own penciling. I am cheer'd! Yet life Is ebbing fast away—I go, where circled By cherubim among the just, rejoices Thy mother—my Arisbe. Theo. O my father! Well may I call thee by that hallow'd name! For thou hast nurtured me with all the affection That parents feel for their own helpless offspring! And now, when I deserv'd thy stern reproof, Compassion to our frailty pardons faults Which had but little claim to thy forgiveness. That Dionysius with thy partial favour Was blest, I knew full well,—the Prelate's son Hence I would fain look up to, for protection. To listen to his vows I deem'd no crime. But secret interviews are fraught with danger. And—no—not once again, by thee unsanctioned Would I have hailed Diophanes! O guardian Of infant years, and more of riper age, O more than parent, whither shall I turn Amid a thousand perils? Whither fly? I see thy feebleness. Thy tongue essays To speak to me one word of consolation, Alas! I fear in vain. Bel. Come hither, children! O let my last grasp join you hand in hand; And I shall die in peace—if peace there be To him who feels, and hath long felt the sense Of having err'd—of having much offended; Yet cannot (weak, and every instant weaker) Repair the offence—yet cannot by its fruits Perfect repentance. Steady to my trust I should have bid thee shun the sculptured caverns Whose hideous monsters yawn'd to amaze thy childhood! Oft to my soul I cried—oft—(whispering peace Where was no peace) “Thou art with God, tho' here, We in the sight of men do specious homage: Whilst I bow down in Rimmon's house, the Lord Pardon me in this thing!”—Alas! my sin Was more than thrice the Assyrian's! Where I bow'd I bade thee bow! To cowardice baser far Than his, I added my poor child's seduction! What though in secret I unceasing taught thee All that was just and lovely, and pourtray'd To Theodora's heart, “the Christian graces,”— 'Twas not enough. Still, hath my bosom throbb'd With joy, as I beheld thee to the Cross Attached, and cherishing with fond delight, The memory of thy sainted mother. Still— Still have I comfort in the hope, that he, Thy destin'd husband—But I faulter! Oh My strength is well nigh gone!— (He with difficulty joins their hands, and falls back senseless.) Dio. My Theodora! Faint not. Thy sorrows shall my tenderest grief Assuage, and I will mix my tears with thine, That shall embalm our monarch's dear remains! And if sedition, with a threatening aspect, Marshal its ranks awhile, a sure asylum Shall hold thee; till I lead thee forth to love And honour, bidding thy foes fly before thee: Till we have reach'd at length the Christian summit To which thy father's dying hopes aspir'd. (They are borne off by the Guards to separate prisons.) ACT IV.— SCENE I. Serinda. The Brahman. The Brah. Say, whence, then, all this reverence for the gods,— For India? Whence this zeal for rites and customs Sacred to thy religion and thy country? What! dost thou fear the flame; henceforth to rank Among the weak deserters of their duty, Thou, who art deem'd a heroine? Or, if terror Repel thee not, wilt thou disdain the honours That crown the faithful widow, who ascends The funeral pile;—provoking Hindoo tongues To brand thee with impiety? Remember! 'Twas by thy order, from the boiling caldron That death was pour'd into the ears of her Who from her husband's pyre had turn'd reluctant! The young and beauteous widow scream'd for mercy, Till, agonized to madness, she expired. Ser. Nay, nay, my counsellor! whose will, thou know'st, Is mine; whose instant word hath—like the rod Of necromancer, smooth'd the passions, swelling Impetuous in my bosom—thou cans't see In my aversion to those mournful rites, Nor cowardice, nor contempt. Thou art aware, To fit me for the holy immolation, I must retreat from all the passing scene At once, into the silence of seclusion. But hath not active virtue worth superior To a tame sacrifice? A living spirit To an expiring soul? To tear the princess From that insidious Nazarite, to recover The tottering throne from the base grasp of Christians— Thus living, sure 'tis better far to live, Than to abandon duty and to die! Yet do I bend to thee, submitting all To thy sagacious guidance—and assured That, soon as with the husband's ashes mingle The relics of Serinda, thou wilt offer The Princess Theodora to the wrath Of Indra! Hark! already from below, Already hiss the fiercest of the desert, Prompt at my beck and Indra's, to destroy The fair apostate. Yet, if one short meeting (Ere to my tomblike chamber I retire) Thy wisdom wink at, I will set before her, Free for her choice, to dazzle or dismay, A sceptre or a sepulrche. The Brah. Then go— And know, that, soon as “with the husband's ashes Shall mingle his Serinda's, I will offer The Princess Theodora to the wrath Of Indra,” if thy gracious terms of pardon The maid despise, incontinently clinging To her fond love—if she reject Prince Saib. Ser. This ring, with magic powers endued, be thine, Thine, for Serinda's sake. It will detect The irresolute, and call up, in loud thunders, A troop of Genii to bear off the faithless, To where Varoona rides the crocodile, Lashing the darksome surge, or sabred Vayoo, His whirlwind mounts, amid the fainting stars Of heaven! Farewell, hoar Sage! SCENE II. An open Balcony.Serinda alone. —Swift on the march Is warlike Saib. From the mourner's cell Shall I be soon released. But, streaming round, See sudden torches fire the court below, And there, to all the heavenly splendour, glitters Yon orient throne. And hark, the Syrian comes, Though link'd, how light! Enter Theodora (brought in by the Guards). In prospect from the Portico; on one side an Area, where by torchlight a wild Elephant and fiery Serpents are let out; on the other side, at distance, a Pavilion, glittering with gold and diamonds, rubies and emeralds, to the full moon. —Hail, Princess!—Hah, the flame Hurts the soft azure of thine eyes, that melt In dewy tenderness. Forgive the rigour That bade thee from thy cool repose, come forth Into an irksome glare. But, if those lids That us'd to shame the eyelids of the morn, It pain thee not, to unclose;—look down and mark A spectacle, to rivet thy attention To the sublime of nature! See, fair maid! Wild from his woods, that Elephant. How nobly He rears his mighty trunk! His small keen eyes Dart fire: aye, he discerns thee! Are they glances Amorous or angry? “I would clasp thee, Virgin!” Or, (is it possible?) their rude expression Tells—“I would trample thee!” From that dark corner There may be some to win thy better love. Lo, kindling to the flambeaux, they uncoil Their undulating lengths—how sleek, how smooth! Is there no charm in their blue scaly burnish? Dost thou not fancy in their forked tongues Delicious pleasure—in their bite a sting— The very sting of rapture? Such be thine! Unless with Saib, who will soon ascend The vacant throne, thou join thy willing hand. Then shall delights, far other, trance thee; then Shall Genii waft thy spirit into bliss Celestial. Turn thee round. In soft relief Yon rich pavilion radiates to the moon. At distance it appears all pearl. Its steps Are emeralds, and its pillars massy gold. Those steps of emerald shalt thou tread—that couch Shalt press, if Saib—but I've hazarded A task inconsonant with every feeling; I sicken at a portrait shaped and coloured By my own fancies. Reptile!—hence—begone! (aside.) Still I would fain, in honour of old Matra— Of wild Orixa, further Saib's suit.— But I abhor her gentle smiles—her meekness— Her sweet angelic looks:—my soul revolts From Theodora thron'd! Besides, her witchcrafts Perhaps might draw Prince Saib to the temple Of Nazareth! Then be the elephant Her husband, and her paramour the serpent! (The guards attempt to bear her off. Theodora struggles, wishing to speak. The Queen (turning round). What! dost thou hover o'er the attractive scene? Dazzled— Theo. No—no—weak woman as I am. Was it thy notion that such glittering baubles Could lure me from my faith?—that e'en thy terrors, With all the howling forest at thy heels, Could shake my steady purpose? No, Serinda! Though I may shriek, my soul shall never faulter. Writhing in torture, I may plead for mercy, But not to Thee. He, who hath stores of comfort, Who heals the broken-hearted—He will hear— The Father of the fatherless, who listens To the poor orphan's prayers, can mitigate The pangs of cruel Death. He, He will hear, And turn the moan of anguish, to a sigh Of pleasure. Ser. Be it so!—The experiment Shall straight be tried. 'Twere barbarous to put off The promise of such exquisite enjoyment! Guards! seize her—throw her down— (The Guards seizing her, the Brahman rushes in.) —What! stand ye rooted? Chain'd as by fascination? Throw her down! Cowards!—'tis her own election. The Brah. Shall the Brahman— Shall Indra's hallowed priesthood, be thus slighted, Thus trifled with, and that too by Serinda, The fervent worshipper of Indra's gods? But to thine own devices must I leave thee. Ser. Pardon my rashness—pardon! 'Twas attachment To India's gods so plunged me into error! I give back Theodora to thy care. The Brah. Yes! to her prison-gloom! and hear again! “Soon as Serinda's with her husband's ashes Shall mingle, I will offer up to Indra The Princess Theodora.” ACT V.— SCENE I. The Brahman alone. 'Tis a ring Right-royal;—'tis a ruby of old time! Well—I will wear it for Serinda's sake. (tauntingly.) Herself insidious, she suspects deceit. But let us try this touchstone. Lo, untarnished— Unclouded, on my finger it retains Its everlasting blush! I see no paleness; I hear no rustling wings—no pealing thunders Of Genii, to annihilate the faithless! Hah! the dissembler!—It is true, her sense Of India's degradation, bids her wreck Her vengeance on the Princess, and hath beckon'd To Saib and his armies. But she hates The rival, while she scorns the Christian. Dreadful Have I observ'd the jealous fires at work, Whether half-smother'd in her breast, or bursting Into a livid flame. Her reign is past! And she is caught in her own craftiness! Her groveling minions, from her fascinations Escaped, shall gather soon obsequious round me; And I will turn her engines of destruction Against herself. Enter the Chamberlain. Cham. They come—they come! the host Of Saib! Thro' the hollows of yon hills They wind in long array—now lighted up— Sabres and spears and all their mass of armour— From yonder orb—now, as the fleeciness Of snowy clouds hath dimm'd its brightness, fading In fitful glimmerings. (as he sees the Brahman.) Traitor! Is it thou? Still meanly skulking, till occasion spur thee, To spring upon thy prey! Thy old heart leaps To the shrill voices of the trumpets.—Hah! That answering blast which thrills the inmost palace, 'Tis from some brother Brahman, like thyself, Affecting peace, yet panting for commotion. Wan poisoner! know, we heed nor thee nor Saib. Sweeping around the palace-walls, our troops Have blended Syrian worth with British valour; While thirst the chieftains from the isles of ocean, To punish regicides and rebels. The Brah. Much Hast thou mistaken Vayoo. From his haunts I call'd not Saib; nor could wish to couple The vulture with the tigress. Saib, wild In native savageness, and still urged on By the fanatic Princess, might in flame Envelope India! I abjure the zeal That persecutes opinion. To the faith Transmitted from my fathers, I adhere. And may our temples of old time, expand Their portals to the ages yet to come Magnificent and glorious. But unshaken The Cross may stand for me. And, O loved monarch! Kind as the gentle rivulets, that refresh The parched glebe, tho' by thy years exhausted, As are those gentle rivulets, dwindling fast Amid the sultry sunblaze.—O my sovereign! Am I a regicide?—Yes, yes, 'twas I That poison'd thee—I mix'd for thee the chalice; I bade thee drink—yet I'm no poisoner! Cham. Hoh! Thou talkest in enigmas. But the tramp Of steeds and clash of arms too loudly tell There is no room for parley. SCENE II. Dionysius the Bishop; Diophanes, his Son. Dioph. O my Father! I have resources still. Inconstant—weak, Are the Queen's ministering slaves. Her brand Of persecution to the Brahman glares, Dire as the comet thro' the saddening night Shoots sanguine streams; and his mild spirit falls back Scared by the blasting of her wasteful fury. Nor doth he mark unmoved the increasing tide Of Syrian popularity; but sheathed In deep insidiousness, to save himself, Turns her own plots against her. 'Twas this moment My chains were by a hand unknown struck off! I fly to give the Princess air and freedom. SCENE III. The Princess just released from Prison; the Chamberlain assisting her. Enter Diophanes. Dioph. Courage, my Princess! All the palace floors Are slippery from the blood of traitors! Vain Were Calou's voice, proclaiming at their peril, That none unite them with the fell invader, Had not the lances of the British heroes Here, dripp'd from rebel slaughter—had not spears There bristled—yet to madden through the crowd: When, veering as the gulf-winds of Arabia, The palace guards to our's their forces jon'd, And to the approaches of insulting Saib Bade fierce defiance. Desperate was the conflict, Tho' but of short duration. Breathing rage, And uttering execrations, the young Prince Hew'd out his way amid the thickest, darted Upon the British warrior his fired eye, And challenged Edred to the combat. Clash'd Sabre and sword; and northern nerve well nigh Had yielded to the lubricating tricks Of a sly foe, when with one forceful impulse Edred into an undefended part His gleaming falchion plunged; and Saib fell. Struck, panic-struck, the remnant of his army Fled to the mountains. But the wounded Prince Appears—a lion taken in the toils. Saib, (borne in, wounded desperately,) Miscreants! to massacre your priests—your Gods! I would have raised your temples, towering over The smoking fragments of each Syrian roof! And, if the pillar of a church yet stood,— A solitary column,—straight its base Should have been painted crimson—from a Christian, Should from a Christian's heart have been enrich'd— And for its capital, have borne his limbs Blacken'd or blanchd! (Turning to Theodora,) No—Theodora,—no.— Thy Bishop or thy Bishop's son,—forgive me!— I would have spared his life—in kind compassion I would have brought him to the bridal chamber, And bid him melt—still melt with love, and feed Upon thy charms, and sigh and sigh again! Yes! my fair Syrian! from a pleasant nook Close by our nuptial couch should he have languish'd? And thence through iron bars, have look'd and look'd Upon our raptures! Yes! my lovely Syrian! And after his fine sense was sated well, I would have stabb'd him thus! (aiming a stab at her.) Curse on this weapon! Have I then miss'd thee? Sorceress! have I miss'd thee? Curse on this quivering arm! May Indra, Vishnoo, Wrapt in the roar of the elements—O! these pangs! Hither, fair Theodora! Dread me not— Dying—by death disarmed—I have yet something To whsiper to thy secrecy! Forgive— Thou wilt forgive—Oh! (As she approaches, he again attempts to stab her, and in the violent effort expires.) Chamberlain. There expired a wretch— A desperate wretch, who would have bid the brooks, In every vale, from every rock, run blood; Or if a Syrian to his dwelling wooed The limpid fountain, would have bid it froth Pollution! Thanks to bravery not our own— Thanks to a British arm. SCENE IV. The Princess, Dionysius, Edred and Sigelin, the Brahman. The Brahman, (aside to the Princess) Puissant Princess! Dismiss thy guards; nay, nay, suspect me not! Dismiss thy guards, and I'll disclose to thee, Truths, to awaken terror and delight And indignation!—Know, then, high assembly! [Exeunt the Guards, &amp;c. The old king lives! I minister'd, 'tis true, The poison; but I likewise minister'd The antidote! Beneath Serinda's eye Fraught with pale death, the chalice fum'd and sparkled! Long had her hatred in my feign'd assent Confiding, plann'd the deadly scheme. Yet lo! He lives! And if perfidious you abhor me, It is my perfidy hath sav'd my sovereign,— And more than sav'd. Already for the pile Hath it prepar'd a corpse Serinda deems Her husband's. With this corpse shall she consume, I trust a righteous sacrifice. A rescue Clos'd in her widowed chamber she expected, And still expects. But all is ordered well— E'en on her funeral pyre will she look round For help in vain,—that help which to preclude Her wavering, and to silence hopes and fears Wild on the wing, at length I promised her. Sig. Thy stratagem I like not—though deceit Be to deceit opposed. Not that I plead In pity for Serinda. But I hate All artifice. To Justice I consign her— Impartial Justice; that the avenging sword Grasps in the face of day. Dion. But lo! she faints— The Princess faints. Her sire's return from death To life, by a too sudden rush of joy O'erpowers her. Theo. (recovering) Oh! my father! Is it true? My venerable father!—once again Once may I call thee mine? Oh! let me seek thee— Fly to thine arms. But may my pleading voice Be heard—Spare, spare Serinda!—Let her live! Though every ill she wish me, may her malice Be soften'd by the gentleness that renders For evil, good! Perhaps, though now obdurate, In penitential tears she may relent, And have some claim to mercy! Ser. (overhearing Theodora as she is brought in) Mercy! mercy! What, from the Syrian Christian? I disdain it! Though her sleek bishops vaunt their silk attire, Their muslin robes, their mitres and their crosiers; Though, as they strut or cringe, the golden crosses Hang—from their necks,—hang glittering—and their beards Sweep in grey majesty their sapphire girdles— Yet—I despise them all! (turning to Dionysius.) And thou deceiver! (turning to the Brahman.) Hoar in iniquity—thou arch impostor!— Art willing to hold out to me the cup Of sweet salvation? Curse on all thy cups! Poor clumsy plotter! Could the murderous uproar— The revolutionary clang escape My ears? Thou shouldst have well secur'd thy victim, Though scarcely bars of iron, walls of brass Could have done that. I am betray'd by all— All leagued, all join'd confederate against me— Except my poor old doting king. For deeds Of horror if I ever own'd compunction, 'Tis for an act—my poor old doting king! 'Tis for an act of horror against thee! I feel a pang that rends me!—But my sins Will I soon expiate. (As she brandishes a dagger, and the Guards approach, she cries:) Off! obstrusive minions! There—there! (she stabs herself.) O! that my poor old king—my husband— Grant,—grant me my last dying prayer!—This body Be to the waves consign'd! The crystal blue Serene, the torrent-foam alike will bear me Where I shall slumber, to Narayen dear! (dies.) Enter the Chamberlain. Cal. Hear! To Diophanes and Theodora The king resigns his throne! And soon shall glow The hymeneal moment; and all India Hail the fair forms of Righteousness and Peace! Sig. Yes! And long future ages shall repose Beneath the Christian banner! Lo! the glory Of Albion, as of Lebanon, shall stream O'er India—To her cities shall we cry “Behold your Saviour and your God!” Then Truth And mild Humanity—wrapt in red storm As Superstition rolls away—shall snatch The infant from the alligator's jaws;— Shall save the aged parent from the flood Which—at the bidding of the unnatural son— Would swallow up decrepitude;—shall quench The sacrificial pile, that gives the Ganges To lift its billows in portentous light;— Shall rescue the poor victim from the wheels— The crashing wheels of Moloc's tower! Then life Polish'd and fair, then arts and arms shall owe The cross their loveliest lustre! Then shall prelates Commission'd from the British islands, rule The Church extending here, in harmony With Syrian hierarchs! 'Tis to that bright union I look with the prophetic eye of transport!— That happy union, when dissenting tribes Shall blend in cordial friendship—when the sun Shall never more arise—no more go down— Shall shine no more—but on Messiah's kingdom! “?? ??? ?? ????? ???????? ????????? ? ?????” —See Herodot.

Low murmurs from some hollow seem'd to sigh; A sear leaf rustled, though no tree was nigh: And through the gloominess a charnel sound To startled Fancy wail'd and wander'd round; And mingling with the interminable waste Whistled with sudden whirl the loosen'd blast. Fierce was the rush of icebolts! The torrs rang! In each chill pause the soaring seagulls sang; And sabler to their snowy pinions, broke The cloud in fragments like an iron rock; Till now the moon with gradual ray serene In fairy slumber hush'd the silent scene. But lo! with startling sound, from ferny fens, Down craggs, and midst the coppice of the glens, Swell'd by a flood A sudden turbid state of the waters is often observable in the lowlands, though all be sunshine and serenity. “A storm had burst on Dartmoor. The river through Ashburton, where we enjoyed a ‘clear blue sky,’ was unaccountably swelled and troubled.” —Note of the Author passing through Ashburton. But it is not Dartmoor only. Haldon, in its comparative small extent, often astonishes us by its sudden inundations. Archdeacon Andrew, Mr. Prebendary Swete, and myself, in our way to Chudleigh on horseback (to visit our friend Burrington) happened to separate from each other near Mamhead. At the bottom of Haldon, (on the way to Chudleigh) Swete and I, who were riding together, joined Andrew.—We were all three surprised. I had stayed, with Swete, to stop from a thunder shower, behind. Andrew had ridden briskly on. The shower fell on the top of Haldon, between us. We had, neither on the one side nor the other, a drop of rain. But an amazing torrent was running down from Haldon, where the rain had fallen. unseen, new rivers pour, And for soft rills impetuous cataracts roar!

'twas no light idea, fancy-bred— The fond illusion that our wishes fed. I see—I see—midst rocks in ruin hurl'd, In orient splendours rise a little world; Though gloomier scarce was chaos, when through night Fair Nature dawn'd, to hail the lamp of light; When first young Spring in vivid verdure glow'd, And, in the expanse of azure, Ocean flow'd; When on the hoary mass its quickening soul Primordial Beauty breath'd, and shap'd the whole. 'Tis true, time was when all the pomp of woods Curtain'd the sacred carnes, and swept the floods; When, far within the forest, white cascades In flashings, seem'd to kindle up the glades. Then to the torrent's roar, the cavern's yell, How ductile ignorance adoring fell; And nightbirds scream'd, and whizz'd the lightning's shaft, Wing'd by despotic power or priestly craft. In climes remote, a stream, an ominous bird,— 'Twas the same influence sway'd the unletter'd herd. There bold Ambition bade her minions rear To dastard Guilt or superstitious Fear The amazing monument and tower sublime, To send her glories down to future time; And where the tyrant over millions trod, Nail'd to a narrow nich the future god. There, as Caprice chased Echo from her dells, Domes sprang from bowers, and pyramids from cells; And, idly wrapt in one stupendous gloom, A province frown'd, a temple or a tomb.

It is remarkable that these seats of the legislators of a code of laws, curious from their antiquity, and their relation to the tinners and tin-mines of the Duchy, have been destroyed, indirectly, by Judge Buller.

This alludes to Risdon's third wonder—“Childe of Plymstock, hunting in the forest, lost his company and his way likewise. Benumbed with cold, he was enforced to kill his horse, and embowelled him to creep into his belly to get heat, but was frozen to death.” —See Risdon, p. 198.

The following story (which the author himself heard many years ago at Buckfastleigh) was an interpolation introduced as a relief, or episodically. But it is too familiar for the general sentiment and description of the poem. The notions of the pisky or pixy beds, and of the efficacy of the skins of adders or vipers as amulets, still exist in the vicinities of Dartmoor and other parts of Devon. But late (from his own lips the tale was told, And Buckfast's walls the mining veteran hold,) A carle who, trusting to his nimble nag (Familiar with each swamp and copse and crag) Amidst the forest, bent his weetless way, Was—so it seem'd—arrested by a ray That blink'd as from a cot—a casement light— And then as from a lantern!

This is not out of character. It was the very language of the miner, who actually attributed his escape to the potency of the adder's skin. chang'd to amethyst. “I ran, reach'd home, but knew not how I went— In short, it was all fairy ravishment! Perchance, I owe my life to what I found— An adder's skin just cast on pisky-ground.”— Vain mockeries! But with untold perils teems The inhospitable heathland! Are they dreams?

And they too walk'd the spacious tents between, Seers, who had mark'd the moment golden-starr'd, Announcing to bold deeds the Koran's bright award. Others, as odours round rich spicery sheds, Unlade the bunches of the burden'd beast: Towering, the camels lift their tawny heads; Some sacred, and from toil for age releast, Camels employed in bearing presents to Mecca or Medina —exempt, ever afterwards, from labour.

They start as by one impulse, circling frisk, Leap upwards wing'd in air, and whirling round The dance urge maddening to a burst of sound! Still giddily they thread the mystic maze; The timbrels give new force to every bound: Their horse-tail lances whilst the pachas raise, From all the motley camp assembling nations gaze! Down drop as from the sudden dart of death, Down drop the maniacs, and along the sod Lie motionless, one body without breath! What mute attention waits “the inspired of God”! They rise!—as if returning they had trod Heaven's sapphire floor! They stretch their arms, their eyes, To where, from that unperishing abode The Immortals had reveal'd high mysteries! And hark! I hear, I hear the tidings from the skies! “Othmans! who to diffuse the holy faith That beams immutable from Mecca's shrine, Ye, who have traced through wilds your burning path, Scoop'd hills of ice, and brav'd the stormy brine; Who soon, with Stamboul though the West combine, Shall slay your millions, as ye whilom slew; To heralds from above your ears incline! Angels have open'd victory to your view! (The Arch-Dervise thus exclaim'd) the glorious track pursue! “Ere long o'er yon black battlements shall float Our ensigns! See to Othman Cæsar bend!

Sleek her jet wings, and weave her quiet nest, And (sent from where the sacred relics rest) Sweet harbinger of mercy, safely shut Your dwellings from the fire, the putrid pest, And scatter blessings o'er the lowliest hut As Aden's cassia-breeze, or gums from Hadramut! “Yet know, to each resistless Destiny Decrees or life or death, o'erruling all; And to the soldier, if foredoom'd to die, Suits his own shaft, or sends his certain ball; And they, who grappling with the foeman fall, Shall to new life, sustain'd by angels, rise! Then mount, my sons! then mount the mouldering wall, And, if ye win no transient earthly prize, Yours be the eternal bowers, the blooms of Paradise. “There bubbling founts from rocks of crystal play, And cool in tinkling rills, refresh the glade: To her own rose the bulbul swells the lay, And spring's young colours blush through every shade: There, to no asp, no tusky boar betray'd The cave, far opening to its roof, allures Voluptuous pairs; and many a black-ey'd maid The sweet sigh mingles with her paramour's: Such is the promis'd bliss—such, Moslems! such be yours! “Yes! from the serpent safe, the ravenous tusk, Shall fleet your rapturous moments. Yours the girls Sprung to immortal youth from purest musk! Lo, from pavilions hollowed out in pearls They come! And each o'er his green couch unfurls The rosy silk, to veil love's joys intense!

There is a sudden silence in the camp! The breezes faint and fainter sympathize With passion's breathlessness. A hollow tramp— And echo indistinctly falls and dies Upon the doubtful sense. The dread emprise Awakens every hope and every fear! And now, as billows upon billows rise, Heard ye not hoarser sounds—yet—yet more near, Gathering as in the van—remurmur'd in the rear? And now pale expectation all aloof The din of horsemen from the deep defile, Hark!—near and nearer still the rampant hoof! Now rapid through the ruins of yon pile, What sparkled, like illusion, sinks awhile! Now rising, flashes all the embattled force, Round yon green knoll unwinding coil on coil; Oh, hear ye not the whirlwind of their course? Breaking from out the cloud, behold each warrior-horse And, mark ye that imperious steed? He paws The smoking turf—his mane the boreal stream! Prancing, he seems to swallow up applause— To swallow as his own his master's fame. Distinct the mailplates of the Sovereign gleam, As o'er his head the crimson banners fly: The diamonds of his deadly dagger flame! To the shrill trumpets, lo! the troops draw nigh, And armies lick the dust before his withering eye.

Janizaries! bid my heralds haste, And through the camp their Soldan's will proclaim! Yon spires, yon fanes, to solemnize your fast, Shall bow their pinnacles to Islam's name!

By Mohammed's fount! We shall lay low the crafty Nazarite! Soon o'er the neck of Europe shall we mount, Fair brothers of the sun! You pass'd the Hellespont! “I have discomfited the great, the proud! I have asunder snapp'd the strength of war; O'er all the city on its heavy cloud Hangs, in pale guise, the spectre of Despair! Behold! my captive Theon was a star Refulgent through the Grecian firmament: Cheer'd by his beams I saw e'en dastards dare. But well nigh is the princely splendour spent; To light a glimmering cell—a loathsome dungeon lent. “Fly not—though liquid fire its cataracts pour— That inextinguishable fire! I wield To seal the vengeance of the destined hour, The magic lance that won so many a field. And lo! to my all-conquering prowess yield Earth, air, and seas! My barks His transporting by land his lighter vessels and military stores from the Bosphorus into the higher parts of the harbour, was certainly an enterprise of a marvellous cast. that plough'd the deep, (With echoes not their own whilst rapture fill'd Scaur “In the formation of the shores of the Bosphorus, are huge mountains, broad scaurs, and wooded promontories in beautiful variety.” —Dallaway, p. 137. and dark dale) I plunged down yonder steep, And shaped their boiling track with necromantic sweep. “Then know, if any wretch from shot or shaft Run trembling, by the vault of heaven I swear, I will arrest him, though an eagle waft The recreant's body through the realms of air! Yes! may their rage my reeking heartstrings tear, If demons give not to the burning knife New venom!—if where whips of scorpions glare, I bid not fiends, with human joy at strife, By hell's own agonies protract the pangs of life. “See, flushing up again its faded ray, See Gabriel's self in yon descending orb, Sure messenger!—Once more the parting day Once only shall the ‘golden horn’ absorb Ere victory shall lift up her voice!—Then curb Your daring, till arise that dazzling morn! And him, whom no false fears of fate disturb, Who overtops yon rampires, foremost borne, Him shall the robe of power—the sabled robe adorn. “Yon towers—yon splendid structures all are mine! But to my valiant troops the uncounted spoil, The treasures of the city I resign— Right meed of warlike worth—of pearls a pile! Luxurious baths, and love's consenting smile! To each, a province! There, if woods have charms— If lawns—if glens—shall sports his day beguile; His only war, the hunter's brisk alarms— His pleasure after toil, enamour'd beauty's arms!” Sudden, the tambour's swell, and cymbal's clank And sulph'rous volley shook the camp, the strand, And died among the mountains. Rank on rank, Waved into being as by sorcerer's wand, Already had in thought a bristling band, Pour'd thro' the shatter'd gate midst arrowy showers, And vengeance triumph'd in the flaming brand; In thought already had they scal'd the towers; Already had they seiz'd the Harem's sacred bowers. “High Alla! the one Alla!”—flew from tent To tent, amid the frantic uproar, flew; And with Mohammed's name the air was rent! And, now its veil o'er all as darkness threw, On the night-centinels a sanguine hue Was cast from many a window's The Turkish Camp “full of windows.” kindling light, And, far illumed the Euxine's deepening blue, A long reflexion flash'd from height to height, And dim Byzantium rose, and quiver'd on the sight. CANTO THE SECOND. Prince Theon and Calirrhoe. Though this story may appear, at first, merely episodical, yet its incidents will be seen, in the progress of the poem, to accelerate the fate of the city, or to facilitate its fall. Now fleeted was the hour of pale midnight; The fires were fainting; and lamp after lamp Shot up and languish'd in a flickering light; In momentary blazes shone the camp, The greensward, the dark wave, the distant swamp, And hush'd was all the immeasurable shade; Save that frogs croaking through the dim-blue damp, From marsh remote, the incessant murmur made, Save that the wolf's dire howl, the wild dog answering bay'd. Here shapes, like steeples, trembled and were gone, Then wavering re-appear'd with steady pace; Yet, less and less, as wasted, one by one, The lamps to blackness left a broader space: When lo! two forms their shadows seem'd to chase, (Not like the gait of warder, sturdy, slow) And vanish'd in the gloom a fiery trace Of sabres! 'Twas the transitory glow Of steel that might descend in death's avenging blow. But the two gliding forms uninjured pass'd The centinels;—each, like a Janizar In armour. Yet suspicion haply cast A squinting eyeshot on the timorous air, The softer gestures, that ill-suiting war, Now mimick'd boldness and now shrank from view; Though, to elude the search of sleepless care, Was utter'd (through the camp a ready clue), Perchance with faltering voice, the watchword “Alla dhu!” In the night-vapour of a murky cell Doom'd to the bowstring, lay a captive chief: The Grecian prince foreknew his sentence well, And hail'd in friendly death the durance brief. Yet sometimes in an agony of grief, As mantled the life-stream, his hands he clasp'd; Then caught, from fancy caught, a short relief; Then, in a sit of desperation gasp'd For breath, as he no more the illusive phantom grasp'd. Yet calmer—see against a column's plinth That moulder'd in decay, reclines the prince. Clustering his locks were like the hyacinth: His umber'd brow the soldier would evince; The bard, his eyes of bright intelligence— Though pensive thought had sober'd Fancy's Fire. Such Theon was. The purple's proud pretence He scorn'd, nor would to royal maids aspire; But on his love-sighs frown'd a supercilious sire. Stream'd a quick lustre on the dungeon dank— “Dauntless but for Calirrhoe had I died— With her”—(clank'd all his chains with ominous clank) “Life were yet dear!”—“Then life be thine!” she cried— Her janizary-headpiece flung aside, And fluttering into view the female dress. “Lo! in Calirrhoe thy devoted bride!” Impassion'd airs her hopes, her fears confess; And o'er her slender neck the started wandering tress. “Rise, rise my Theon! To thine aid I flew, Where to the brazen door the dark vaults wind. In secret to ‘the golden gate’ I drew, The boy Abdalla to our wishes kind. Haste, my own Theon! haste: Leave death behind! And may thy valour from the Tyrant rend His trophies—him, whom faith nor treaties bind: Oh! to the noblest of the Cæsars lend Thy help—at this sad hour assist thy royal friend.” Now reaching the pavilion's utmost skirts They pause; and darting down a narrow dell Turn backwards, as the dubious path reverts, Then hurry round a hillock's tufted swell; And now at distance from the prison-cell Press on, beneath the janizary-guise. Sweet, at each light step, was the floral smell, Ere the young May-flowers had unclosed their eyes, Or yet the chilling dawn had streak'd the dusky skies. Their curtain in ‘the dusky skies’ they hail'd: But ah! they heeded with a cold regard (For well their bosoms apprehension quail'd) The first fine fragrance of the velvet sward. There, when her beauteous fabric fancy rear'd, How oft they saunter'd ere the day's dim peep: How oft from open intercourse debarr'd, (While spies they fondly hop'd were still asleep) They watch'd the welcome tint distaining lawn and deep. Huddled amidst the copses of the dales, Dear to the lover's heart the dying rills, The voices of the hundred nightingales, And all their whisperings, all their dulcet trills, When scarce a morn-tint tip'd the extremer hills! Ah! to new terror breaks the lurid light: Not a bird flutters, not a leaf but thrills! Hark,—'tis the horses of the camp! The night Was long! They neigh—they neigh, and snuff the coming fight. And what a sound was that? The camp-neigh? No— A tramping, as of steps?—a thickening clash! And what a death-pause?—Now as nimble roe The tripping, and now heavy is the splash As labouring all through fenreeds. But that flash! The long vale bellows to the carabine! Down the long vale the dread pursuers dash! Still to the gloom, where but a faint gray line Yet glimmers, their poor hope the flying pair consign. And well nigh have they reach'd ‘the Golden Gate’ And they have reached it! Hath Calirrhoe's sway Unlock'd the brazen door—the door of fate, Where secret runs the subterraneous way? The breath of the pursuers on their prey— The poison of a pestilence—breathes hot Upon her panting bosom! Heard ye—say, O heard ye—that swift whistling? One is not! Yes! death was in that burst—in that swift-whistling shot! Yes! Theon had dispatch'd a Georgian slave That breathed upon her bosom. But, alas! One fell pursuer only found a grave. Yet undiscovered was the hollow pass Where rush'd Calirrhoe, and the door of brass Clos'd after her. Her scattering senses fled! The maiden wist not where her Theon was, Nor heard the cold groan where the dagger bled, Nor each low cavern-sound, the voice as from the dead. CANTO THE THIRD. Morning-view of Byzantium—Of Greece—The palace at Byzantium—The Emperor Paleologus—The Hall of Audience—Marcian—The Patriarch Phranza —Calirrhoe, Phranza's daughter—The head of her lover Prince Theon exposed on the Turkish batteries. Emerging through the darkness, indistinct Look'd forth Byzantium's loftier turrets; cold And faint, the tremulous lattices now wink'd In the eastward palaces, ere long to unfold In gradual glimpses, all their burnish'd gold. Still hover'd the night-shadows, to enshroud The calm Propontis as it rippling roll'd; And by the bulwarks the black wave o'erbrow'd, Seem'd to its crimsoning edge to attract the morning cloud. Far off along the Isles and over Greece Twilight scarce peep'd. Yet neither land nor shore Nor seas had sleep's oblivion hush'd in peace. Here, as if fate from friends the wanderer tore, To covert glen, alas! to meet no more, A desultory step, a sigh was heard: There the lorn mariner his dashing oar Suspended. Each as if he mus'd and fear'd The dayspring, lurk'd unseen, by May's sweet blush uncheer'd. It was a beautiful—delicious blush That to fair Athens stealing, touch'd that fane The pride of her Acropolis. The flush Through all its shadowy pomp of columns (vain Illumination!)—kindles. To distain Each wreath, each shaft, how rich Aurora's glow! And lo, from walk to walk, from plane to plane, Her tenderest colours fain would pity throw Where streams, to fancy dear, in lingering lapses flow. Yes! they were lingering lapses—to call back Minds that once soar'd in philosophic thought! Yes! they were lingering lapses—to awake The Poet's song, with fire from Phœbus fraught! For this (which a friend calls a most happy) transition from Athens to Byzantium, I am indebted to a real event in history. Some adventurers from Athens or Attica built the city of Byzaatium more than 600 years before Christ.And they might tell of times, ere Plato taught, When from thy harbour through the flashing spray, Athens! thy venturous sons of commerce, sought The central station, the colonial bay; And rear'd Byzantium's towers, to rule the watery way. And now those towers in morn's full splendour shone, And from its grove the top of every dome Rose in new radiance to the unclouded sun; And May's clear lights seem'd emulous to illume St. Sophia's galleries, and the garden-bloom, The palace-roofs, and all the glittering sea; And sportive thro' the unblemish'd Alluding to the brazen triple serpent, of which Mahomet broke one of the heads with his battle-axe. Hippodrome, Chequer'd with orange-tints each greener tree, As if not long so gay such dancing lights must be! From odorous slopes to arbours zephyrs stole— From mossy margins to the cool cascade, Wafting their early freshness to the soul; Whilst a thin cloud that o'er the city stray'd, Robed in its snowy fleeciness of shade Turret and spire and cypress, pine and palm: Ah! deep had trouble its impression made, If vain the power of that voluptuous calm, Where every ray was gold, and every breeze was balm. Slanting along the palace-walls, a line Of light into the portico had pass'd, And bade its colonnade far sparkling shine, And statues of renown yet undefaced Hoar in each nich, with various lustre graced; And, midst the interior chambers a rich stream On saffron cushions a reflexion cast, And as it play'd o'er ermine, jasper, gem, A coruscation broke, to deck the diadem. There was an eye upon that orient crown, An eye of pensive sorrow. Constantine is justly characterized by Gibbon, as “the first of the Greeks in spirit, as in rank.” 'Twas a look Which imaged grandeur, destined to go down, Mourning ‘a coruscation,’ that so broke To sink in shade! There was no tongue that spoke. More eloquent expression seem'd to say: “O! in the effulgence brightening yonder nook, I see my specious greatness, like the day, Still beaming whilst it flits, but flitting fast away.” Musing upon the menacing host, he stood— His people veering like the winds—from fate That shrank in terror. Yet his attitude— How noble—not from proud imperial state— Not from the gauds that sceptred power await! The mien majestic from the inspiring mind, The conscious virtue, in itself elate, Were his; and to its righteous will resign'd, High confidence in heaven, and mercy to mankind. Unwearied had he seen the breaches yawn, And prompt repair'd. The assailants were not nigh— But tubes must roar, and daggers must be drawn! It was a grim repose. Gleams the red sky To horizontal clouds, that dreadfully Surge upwards, billows with no breath of air! But soon is heard the elemental sigh, The hiss—full soon is seen the azure glare! So sleep the Moslem flags, so fierce defiance flare. His brows the monarch from the ponderous casque Had now reliev'd—his hauberk had unbrac'd. 'Twas a poor respite from a painful task Where thought fast follow'd toil! And now he paced The room of audience, but as one in haste— A last resource how anxious to explore, A little strength lest ill-aim'd efforts waste; When garments trail'd along the marble floor, And war's accoutrements shook round the corridor! There was no stealthy step—no daring stride— “Welcome! the first thy pleasures to foregoe, Welcome, my honest Marcian! thou, the pride Of patriots, to thy country's foes a foe! If richer in thine eyes the purple flow, O! for thy sake may heaven still shield the throne!” When cried the rough old chief—a conscious glow Flush'd his high brow—“'Tis generous love alone That in our Christian race, can crying sins atone. “Say, is it not enough to seal our doom, That jealousy disdains a sister's aid, That hate unchristian spurns the help of Rome? And deprecates as all in ambuscade, With dark suspicion, the tiara's shade? Yes! hierarchal spleen would hail the flash, And prefer the turban of Mahomet to the Pope's tiara. The flash of crescents on our spires display'd, And bid the insulting Othmans midst the crash Of churches, on each shrine the cross and crosier dash.” Scarce had he said—the Patriarch's self appear'd, And his own angel hail'd him where he went! Descending o'er his girdle flow'd his beard, His lofty stature by age downwards bent, But ruddy was his countenance; besprent His wrinkled brow with some few silver hairs. There energetic zeal, with sorrow rent, Shew'd one, who the pure light celestial shares, Yet for the love of man dismiss'd not earthly cares. The eventful hour had kindled up again His youthful passion—his heroic flame: And with a warrior-spirit, he burnt to arraign The wretch well meriting reproach and shame Who skulk'd unmindful of the Grecian fame! Yet to a deeper, holier confidence Than could arise from any worldly name, He loved to excite his people, and dispense Of God's protecting care the reverential sense. “Ah! shall those infidels have power to seize Our seven-hill'd city? Though they quick devour, Far as the eye flings round its wondering gaze, Pernicious, every plant and every flower; Yet do we dread the locusts of an hour? Have we not seen but erst the gathering swarm (Their noise like chariots on the mountains) pour? Were they not brush'd away? How vain the alarm! The besom we beheld—we view'd the almighty arm! “ The army of Amurath, invading Greece in 1445, had orders to destroy all the Greek monuments on their way. —See Knowles's History of the Turks.Whilst over Asia and pale Greece he pass'd, Though ruin mark'd his pestilential wrath, And ancient fanes were sunder'd at the blast; (Thus instant lightnings here, the cypress scath There shiver as to reeds)—could Amurath The army of Amurath, invading Greece in 1445, had orders to destroy all the Greek monuments on their way. —See Knowles's History of the Turks. Within this tabernacle his vengeance wreak? Did not the beauteous Virgin ward off death From every door? Our peace her presence speak? Not on yon battlements so mild was morning-break! “From such a savage shall not heaven revolt, His secret chamber 's but the lion's lair— His sceptre but the blazing of a bolt; The sunshine of his smile, a meteor-glare? And say, if public faith, if virtue share An earthly boon—if truth the guerdon claim; Say, shall an equal God the tyrant spare? Shall Yathred vindicate the impostor's aim, And urge libidinous creeds through hurricane and flame? “Shall the dominion whose supernal birth Was in the song of God's own seers foretold, Whose glories (that had well-nigh filled the earth Ere time its page was destined to unfold) Stood in the volume of our faith enroll'd, Shall it dissolve before a robber-horde? Shall Cæsar's hand Messiah's sceptre hold (Here, here first wielded by an earthly lord) To shake in palsy-guise, unnerv'd by paynim-sword?” “No! not ignobly shall the Cæsar fall!” (Cried Phranza) “No! of coetaneous growth E'en with the world, and overshadowing all, Fear we the race of rapine, guile and sloth? The Turcoman, that heeds nor faith, nor oath? And thou the noblest of the Cæsars!—Dire As tigers will we rally, by my troth, Around thee! spurning sabre, smoke, and fire— And every lewd device, that panders to desire. “Though reconnoitering, in his garish garb, Yon Aga may in scorn these bastions spy, As bounds along the plain his holster'd barb,— Though here he build in thought the soft Serai,— Eftsoons, before our fury shall he fly! Hurl'd, hurl'd away its scabbard, lo! the work Of heaven shall every sword relentless ply, And, rooting up his beard, the caitiff Turk Hide in the rocks his shame, with beasts where out-laws lurk. “Though soft o'er Adrian's city whisper pines; To myrtles though its stars the jasmine flaunt; Though round the rich balconies purpling vines; Though clustering grapes the prophet's eye affront; To luxury steaming through the oblivious haunt, Though alabaster baths their odours waft; Its dashing springs though jasper basin vaunt, And gilding glitter from each agate shaft; And mirrors lust inflame, her bowls where pleasure quaff'd; “Though wanton harems—silk seraglios fold Love without sighs, and beauty without bloom; Though velvet canopies inwrought with gold, Hang o'er the sofas of the pillar'd room, To shadow the proud turban's diamond-plume; Say, though Bassora—furtherest India—dress Magnificence in all its sullen gloom, And slaves its footstool, cringing slaves caress,— Yet midst profusion frowns a parching wilderness! “And what, though turning from the gay kiosk All in the lightsome robe of summer drest, We note the statelier grandeur of the mosque, Where ragged fakirs shame the Mufti's vest; Though as the solar beams sank down the west, Have canting Imaums with sly reverence met The effulgencies that fired the Bairam-feast, Hail'd them as hallow'd suns no more to set, And pour'd their floods of sound from galleried minaret: “Avaunt!—ye minions of a throne; avaunt, Ye despots, that rejoice in sabred heads! The Pacha's menaces, the Santon's rant, Far hence!—Nor here where Truth her radiance sheds, Nor here where innocence with honour weds, Shall the dark Othman riot all unchaste! Ye dissolute eunuchs! guard far other beds! With bridal smiles I see this palace graced! I see the exalted pair embracing and embraced!” “Phranza still hoped to bring to a successful issue his negotiations for the bride,” &amp;c. —See Gibbon, xii. 172, 173. “Think not (he cried) I fear. I have unsheathed The flaming sword of Cæsar! Nor hath rust Sullied its splendour. Lo! to me bequeath'd A crown I prize, to Rome and Valour just: Yet, as the fen-born vapour is discuss'd By the warm sun, the shadowy thing should flee Before a brighter crown—a nobler trust! Great, Cæsar was; and great may Cæsar be! —The Christian stands or falls! alike 'tis victory! “The hour of trial surely comes. How nigh We know not; nor the assault how sagely plann'd. The breath of rumour is, perchance, a lie. With matchless warriors are our rampires mann'd. Warriors, that to their unblench'd eagle, stand Firm-rooted But erelong, while evening lends Its light serene, we breathe, my little band! A prayer to him, who death or triumph sends: St. Sophia shall behold my soldiers, Christian friends. 'Twas thus ‘his little band’ the Chief address'd; When, as the rose without its freshness fair, The valorous Phranza's daughter seiz'd his vest, Low bending. Wonder, terror mark'd her there! Her veil thrown backwards, and her chesnut hair Burst from its silken tie. She thrice essay'd To speak. By anguish torn, that well might tear The hardiest, her half-utter'd words betray'd To sympathy, to grief, the poor disorder'd maid. “Hear me, my sovereign! hear. No rumour sprung From error or affright, be mine to spread. The boy Abdalla from that Othman's tongue Caught these sure words—‘In secret’ thus he said— (A roof of pearl pavilioning his head)— ‘With the first dawn steal on! targe close to targe! The Georgians in the van! Their heaps of dead Shall fill the trenches to the rampire's marge! Then mount the corpses—mount, impetuous to the charge.’ “To generous Theon by some charm attach'd, (To save that Prince how weak was many a shield) The boy Abdalla the meet moment watch'd, And stole A favourite boy of a sultan stealing the royal signet, is no improbable fiction. I think a similar incident occurs in the history of the Turks. a signet to which nations kneel'd, With the unchain'd prisoner cross'd the tented field, And by the darkness, by disguise conceal'd, “Still mock'd the vain pursuit.”—The blush that dyed Her face, the quivering voice her flame reveal'd! “Seek, seek, if not too late!”—the virgin cried, Tears on that burning blush fast as they dropp'd were dried. Hurried away, her wild glance to the walls Calirrhoe, all involuntary threw: Ah! what beyond the bastion, what appals? O say, if there be heart to passion true, Is not to her the tenderest pity due? High on the Moslem-tower those locks that reek— Stiffening in gore their hyacinthine hue! The sun-fire fierce upon the blackened cheek! She saw, and did not swoon—She saw, and did not shriek! CANTO THE FOURTH. Procession to St. Sophia—Description of the Temple —Prostration before the Altar. The expanding portals of the Palace creak; And ‘the small ministering band’ come silent, slow As on the sight the imperial banners break, Friends, that had walk'd in God's own house, they go Circling their sire: yet not the sable show, The minute-march of death was theirs! The mood Of patient virtue brooks not measured woe! In those calm features no misgivings brood, But resignation blends with manly fortitude. Yet, Queen of Cities, yet thy marble fanes, Thine ivory palaces, alas! they mourn As to the imaginings of fear, their vanes— Their pinnacles each seems a funeral urn! Thy streets—some spectre, sure, at every turn Hath scared them into stillness! But that haze— 'Tis the soft evening-mist of Maia born— The dewy wreath which glistening to the gaze, With amber is now rich, and now with rosy rays. The damsel look'd out from her window, lone, In grief, and sigh'd. 'Twas not Calirrhoe's sigh! And (as the lattice here to Hesper shone) Amongst a woe-worn groupe, might you descry In asking innocence the troubled eye. To ‘the great porch’ ‘the ministering band’ advance: And on the Patriarch's gray beard, fitfully, The crescent-noon flung quick like lightning, glance On glance! Foreboding shades pass'd o'er each countenance! Alas! but erst how dazzling was the pomp! From Galata to Pera, thrill'd the sound Of dulcimer and tabret, harp and trump! And each obsequious forehead grazed the ground; From pawing barbs, the prancings and the bound, The crowd flew backward, as the shadow fleets, Whirl'd with the rack of Heaven! And brandish'd round Flash'd falchions, helmets blazed! The garnish'd streets From censers of pure gold effused Arabia's sweets. From all the embellish'd lattices, were flowers Of every tincture, every smell, rain'd down (As young-ey'd maidens laugh'd) in gentle showers! The gilt balcony had the victor's crown, And was with costliest hangings, silken-brown Or silvery white, in gay assemblage hung: And the priest's purple, and the sable gown In low obeisance bow'd. The sons of song Their prince and patriarch hail'd, and the high galleries rung. But hark!—upon the waves of air, it bore Its burden, “swinging-slow”! St. Sophia's bell Heavily knolling—“its long sullen roar” Reverberates, loud and lingering! Now it fell, As if from overhead with stunning swell! Now more subdued, a melancholy tone Speaks as of parted visions! 'Tis the knell Of other times, of generations gone! 'Tis past—for aye 'tis past—a deep heart-rending moan. Yes! 'twas a deep moan—past, for ever past! And yet a floating murmur seems to meet The sense. 'Tis like a warble o'er the waste, The gurgling as of distant waters—sweet In dying cadence! Shall the Christian greet The warning sound so pleasant to the ear, No more? How many an age have bosoms beat In holy transport, whilst assembled here These courts the pious trod—to saints and martyrs dear! O bathed in purest Heaven, as if the pledge Of grace to man! empyreal dome, thy base Pillar'd above the clouds!—shall sacrilege Break up the pavement of thy holy place, Thy sculptured thrones, thy pictured saints deface, And from thy sick lamps dash the hallow'd oil— Snatch from thy fretted altars, snatch the vase, And with the phrenetic Omar's rites defile The sanctuary of God, where rests the Virgin's smile? Hear, hear the Bosphorus all its echoes rouse! For thee sweats Afric 'midst her swarthy toil; And to thy marble-grandeur Asia bows. Thy starry porphyry sparkled down the Nile: And to support thy venerable pile Laconia triumphs in her emerald stores. Lo! stretch'd beyond the ken thine awful aisle, Thy hundred columns, and thy jasper floors, And lifted up on high thy everlasting doors! Ah! now their gilding and their colours lost, Scarce were the columns visible, all black In night—all—save a pillar that was cross'd By the cold moonbeam. 'Twas a mournful streak: On the nave-floor it slumbered like a flake Of snow. Upon the chancel-balustrade There was a planet's glow-worm lustre weak; And from a solitary taper, ray'd A ray too faint to pierce the vast cathedral shade. To suit that moment's humble mood, was dim And hush'd the temple-scene. The fiery bronze Erst kindled on each column! Loud the hymn Did from a thousand voices swell at once Its raptures, and a thousand gems ensconce The burning brilliance! Now to every tread Is mutter'd a scarce audible response; And a sepulchral gleaminess is shed O'er every form and face through shadows dusky-red. To the lone taper beam'd an altar-vase;— All else in pallid indistinctness gloom'd To the strain'd eye interminable space: What whilom was through all its length illum'd, A line of lessening columns was entomb'd In masses dense and shapeless. Not alone In faith (though to a few weak followers doom'd) Did Constantine his prayers to God make known: A tear he could not check—it glisten'd, and was gone. Is there a sight among the sons of men— A spectacle to move a holier sigh, Than human greatness midst the trying scene Of sorrow, at thy footstool, O Most High— Prostrate before the eternal Majesty? Perchance archangels might have joy'd to hail A prince, the first beneath heaven's canopy Humbled before his God—a reptile frail— Covering with sackcloth coarse the soldier's polish'd mail. “O thou, in whom the spirits of the just Rejoice! O pardon me, Almighty Lord, Whose buckler shields me—in whose strength I trust! If I had injured, or in deed or word, The lowliest fed with crumbs beneath my board, I ask'd forgiveness! Lo, thy blessed Son In his dread chalice have my lips adored! And if my race of life, if I have run— If quiver my last sand—O God! thy will be done! “But to my suffering children—though bereft Of earthly sire, a Father mayst thou be! Have mercy on the remnant that is left! And though to other cities—though they flee, Or wander In 1452, the Greeks escaped in great numbers to Mitylene, and dispersed themselves in the Morea. When all was lost, Leonardus Chiensis fled too; a priest and a companion of Paleologus, whose account of the siege is very interesting. midst the islands of the sea, The cruel enemy, the avenger still! Yet, if thy judgments here fall heavily, Thy law if famine or the sword fulfil, Silent, I dare not search the mysteries of thy will!” “And thou!” (the archpriest cried) “whose constant love For ages hath commission'd seraphim And cherubim descending from above, To guard thy church from robbers that blaspheme (Scaled in their dragon-scales) thy holy name; Who, in thy city, for a thousand years, Hast bid thy frankincense of mercy flame To patriarchs and to saints, O hear our prayers, And listen to our plaints, and look upon our tears! “Hear from thy blessed altar, Lord of Hosts! Hear from the courts so oft these feet have trod, Thine imprecating enemy that boasts A language to defy ‘the living God;’ That ruthless devastation spreads abroad, Polluting each hoar fabric ere it fall— Now thirsting to profane this pure abode! Accept my vows—regard thy suppliant's call, Thou, thou, the Great Supreme, who reignest over all. “E'en as the chaff before the wind, thine ire Shall scatter them—the foes that circumvent Thy race,—like stubble to consuming fire: Root up their standard; smite the Moslem-tent, And rend it, as a vesture that is rent! So, whilst our trust is in the King of kings, Thy banners shall we hail our battlement: So, as thy favour sure salvation brings, Shall peace repose beneath the shadow of thy wings.” Scarce had the Patriarch ceased, when from beneath, A sound as of the wretched seem'd to come, 'Twas like the gnashing of a captive's teeth: And the tall taper, like the blue simoom, Thus even through the temple scene, we are drawing nearer to the catastrophe.Wax'd pale, enough to seal Byzantium's doom! Signs that, inspiring superstitious fear, Flung o'er credulity a lurid gloom, Sent e'en the valiant to the boding seer, Enfeebled many an arm, and blunted many a spear. CANTO THE FIFTH. Far other was a low-arch'd length of room All in a sweltering street, obscure and dun, Where a small cresset redden'd through the gloom, And signs and rites unholy saw no sun. Yet in this nook were battles lost and won, Its startling tale as conjuration told; Yet deeds of horror might the stoutest stun, As sinful souls were to the assassin sold, And honour, truth and peace, confess'd the power of gold. With curtains as of vapour hung, a gleam Asphaltic, shewed—and only served to shew,— How sombrous was the haunt of stratagem, And twinkled ghastlier on a tawny brow; As if some fiend aim'd from the moon to throw A livid sparkle—half-eclips'd her disk! And from deep sockets fill'd with fire, the glow (Which e'en to meet a moment, were to risk Perhaps a mortal stroke) was like the basilisk! Such was the announcer of man's dole or doom, Born where the Siroc with young pleasure wars Waving o'er Yemen's sweets the poison'd plume. His azure mantle spangled o'er with stars, 'Twas his to open tracts where heaven debars Access. And scorn, half-smother'd up by guile, Scoff'd at the fever'd flight of human fears; And on his wan lip, darken'd o'er the while From ruthless eyebrows, lurk'd the malice of a smile. 'Twas he, who to the impetuous Sultan's youth, Unravelling oft his planetary lore, Traced (flaming as the characters of truth) Trophies so reap'd in vision long before, And sped the vollied rage from shore to shore; Till now, to finish what the Fates decreed, Perdition's bolts to Istambol he bore, And in his cell presaged the murderous deed, And stamping all as done, spread out the attractive meed. Before an ebon board the old Arab The similarity of this description with the following passage is remarkable.—“His cheeks were pale and livid.—The eyes gave the look of a demon to the whole—their brilliancy almost superhuman—they shone through the shade of an overhanging brow like torches within a cavern. There was a scowl on the brow, and a smile on the lip—a smile denoting contempt,” &amp;c. —See Morier's Ayesha, vol. II. pp. 80–86, just published. This poem was written many years ago: and not a word of the stanzas in question have been altered. stood, His eyes on some far object fixing fast, And with a start to arrest the circling blood, Recoil'd, and straight some viewless form embrac'd: When turning from a craven throng, he cast A look of shrewd intelligence on one, A treachor, who himself in plots surpass'd, And mumbled mystic words in mystic tone To a stern chief who wav'd a sable gonfalon. With short quick breath, as if Alp over Alp He climb'd, the treachor grin exchanged for grin. Base were his figure, features—base his scalp, And toadlike venom swell'd his yellow skin; And sneaking was he prompt for secret sin. The other, once a courtier, curs'd the court, As, in his aims repuls'd, on Constantine The imagined wrong he thirsted to retort— And bitter was his spleen, imperious was his port. The throng, retreating from Alashtar's rod Saw, in each curve, a wondrous power display'd: 'Twas thus the Memphian worshipp'd his horn'd God By hideous tales and miracles dismay'd. Yet oft a dastard look their doubts betray'd, When (cried he)—“Visions in long order break Upon me!—at my feet that eagle laid; Ruffled his plumes—his flagging wing how weak; Extinguish'd his dread eye, and pale his bloodless beak. “Beneath that banner nursing dream on dream, All in church-panoply though saints enlist; Say, shall the Virgin of Jerusalem Protect the puling layman or the priest? Their altar, though the violet amethyst, Or topaz bright in yellow beams, adorns; Shall violet stones or vows their cause assist? Their jewels and their vows the Prophet scorns! In vain they crowd the shrine—in vain they grasp its horns! Some are there, whom the red-cross zeal hath swell'd To heroes—others, with court favours drunk! But soon their spirits, or by earth impell'd Or heaven, shall pass away—a headless trunk Each body! Sinking—with the city sunk, Ere one shall re-assert his heritage, The warrior shall wax wanton in the monk, The sluggard prelate in the soldier rage, And hermits hail bazars, and sceptre grace the sage. “Emblem of patience, the meek Nazarene May mete out time in penitential shrift, Whilst on his quiet countenance are seen Pardon and Peace! Our bloodhot blades we lift— In gasps no sparing, and in groans no thrift, After the last groan, peace—if death be such! From stage to stage of dying may ye shift— The fiery thirst, the ice with instant touch That curdles up the heart, and Azrael's ireful clutch!” Ere twice ten hours—Calirrhoe, unabash'd Ran through the severing audience—yet with stem Half-snapp'd, a lily by the winter wash'd! “Alashtar! to whose power compared, we deem Of mean account Golconda's choicest gem, Theon's poor relics may thy pity save! Obeisant do I kiss thy garment's hem! O snatch from dire pollution—snatch the brave! Alas! I ask not life—I only ask a grave! “Upon the brink of desperation's gulf Tottering, I turn me to my last resource! From the fell raven—from the mangling wolf, O rescue—rescue that uncoffin'd corse! May the keen anguish of thy suppliant, force A way into thine heart—that I may lie Pillow'd on his pale turf—(in murmurs hoarse The cold winds chaunting his drear lullaby) And with expiring flowers breathe out my latest sigh!” “Yes!—Can the Sultan tears like thine resist? Go—he will give thee all thy prayers can ask— But not the dead Greek's withering turf, I wist! Go—in the sun of royal favour bask. Sure, thou hast charms to spare the conjurer's task!—— Charms to which sovereigns of the earth may crouch! And shall pretence of sorrow pleasure mask, And such affection for a grave avouch? Thy lord, luxurious girl, provides a softer couch! “Those eyes that wander through their silky fringe In timid fawnlike wildness—(with fleet light So have I seen the moon her halo tinge) And like the blanch'd egg Images often occurring in the poetry of the Arabians. which the sands from sight Half-hide, that bosom's palpitating white— Tresses, like dates that cluster in the shade Of their own palms—O say, could thrones requite One smile amid such beauties (slily said The sorcerer) one coy glance from so divine a maid? “Yet I will aid thee. Shew his last left track— Tell me, where last his accents to thine ear Made music; and my art shall conjure back Thy lover's corse! And sweet upon his bier Shall drop the living balsam of thy tear!” The maiden look'd affiance through her woe, Too credulous, nor mark'd Alashtar's leer; Ah! little heeding, that she dealt a blow To hasten Cæsar's doom, and lay Byzantium low! CANTO THE SIXTH. The Fall of Constantinople represented in vision to Constantine, and the Restoration of the City and of all Greece to the Christians. “O Massacre! thy work the demon Islam speeds! White all the plain, with Islam turbans white! The foam see scattering from a thousand steeds!” The cry was from illusion or affright: The alarmist Fancy had deceiv'd the sight; To terror's ear the hostile bucklers ring, And summon up the phantoms of the night, As to the mother's breast scared infants cling, And rustles to the wife the wild-eyed vulture's wing. Their Cæsar's will the impatient Greeks await, The close battalion and the prancing troop, Their long spears bristling at the palace-gate; The presence of the Prince, their surest prop; The awakening watchword—“In yon cross our hope!” And priests and matrons had the portals pass'd; And midst the imperial Court a various groupe Their glances to the high balcony cast, And, as life's flitting breath, each trembling shadow chased. Ah! what a spectacle! the mute amaze; The dubious look; the half-confiding air Of stripling feebleness; the haggard gaze As from a frenzied soul; the stony stare; The arrested step; the statue of despair; The laugh delirious, and the sudden start; And, flinging self aside, compassion's care; And the cold tremour creeping to the heart, Whilst meeting eyes would say: “We part, for ever part!” Their chief some moments to unruffled thought (Now that St. Sophia to the menaced blow Had reconciled his spirit) would fain devote. Yet for the fight his charger neigh'd below, Caparison'd and sleek and like the snow, High Safad: Nor Arabia boasts a fire More fierce—a mane of more exuberant flow: But Heaven's own lightnings perish in their ire, And in their loftiest flights the intrepid oft expire. Harrass'd by all the many-featured day (Firm as he was) into the unconscious trance He sinks. As powers invisible portray, A moment might be an age of dreams or visions. Those who dream, know this from experience. Before him, mimic fleets and armies dance; Till now more clear, lance quivers after lance, And whizzes many a visionary ball, And turbans glimmer round, and corselets glance, Till now distincter quakes the city-wall, And breaches wider yawn, and smouldering fragments fall. Dire was the conflict. Torrents from the foss,— Blood-torrents from a struggling, shivering heap— Ran from the slaughter'd Moslems! And across Their corses, like the surges of the deep, A Janissary band appear'd to sweep, Flying before an Othman's darkling face! He, mighty warrior! kenn'd the rampire steep; And, as he seem'd to scorn the towers of Thrace, Scowl'd on each feeble fort, and grasp'd his iron mace. And then a swart gigantic figure seiz'd A fractured parapet, and backwards fell— (The sovereign's veins a chill of horror freezed) And countless squadrons with a deafening yell (For sound is heard where Fancy weaves her spell) After the pause of one terrific halt, Rush on, the vacillating Greeks repel, And, (all as up the ascent the hot assault They press) through sulphured chasms—o'er blazing bastions vault. The fiercest sank; the haughtiest were unhelm'd; The assailer and the assail'd promiscuous lay. Slacken'd the turban-strength was half o'erwhelm'd, When springing from Under the walls of the city. the ‘subterraneous way,’ The gaunt Alashtar waked the battle-bray; And fiends poured forth, as if her spawn of guilt Earth's central caverns had cast up to day! He stamps the blood of faith and valour spilt: His fired eye-sockets glare, and drips his poniard-hilt. Hard by a chief Justiniani —See Gibbon. in chalybs cased, opposed The foe's irruption from a recent breach, But fled in agony, ere round him closed The assailants, writhing as if caldron-pitch Flamed through his entrails. Plausible in speech Oft had he rail'd at dastards, scoff'd and sneer'd, Yet, like a stricken stag, he sought the beach; And, though the Monarch's warning voice he heard, Flew recreant from the walls, and shrieking disappear'd. And now a royal Greek, with hands outstretch'd, His men essay'd to rally, left alone; Now for a moment menaced; now beseech'd The gathering troops with supplicating tone. “O Safad!” cried the Sovereign, woe-begone! Snorting, his lord through broken ranks he bore, And staggering from a death-shot, heaved a groan! The phantom king, dispurpled, smear'd with gore, Forsaken, sank away—sank to be seen no more. Then through razed streets, as floods foam over flax Or shepherd-fold, the Moslems dash'd amain; And the sword shiver'd, smoked the battle-axe, Smok'd far and near, as glutted with the slain. Then rose St. Sophia's violated fane; And husbands, sires, and sons of every age, And lovely damsels, link'd in one long chain, And ermined nobles, and the prelate sage, Down the broad aisle bewail'd the heartless vassalage. Yet, though their ‘souls the iron enter'd,’ moans From captive kings were not enough to sate Barbaric vengeance. Stain'd the pavement-stones E'en with the blood of sucklings,—early, late, At midday, at midnight, could nought abate The sabre-fury! Thrice the sun arose, And setting saw the ruthless work of Fate!— The dying shrieks that scared the evening-close, Play'd round the Sultan's ear, and lull'd him to repose. Yes! from the city all the mingled cries To the camp wasted, minister'd delight, More soothing than the zephyr's gentlest sighs! And startled by the desultory flight Of birds that flew above in wild affright, He rose, and strait his pillow wooed again, And hail'd the sympathies of such a night! The dogs, compassionating human pain, In troops howl'd o'er the fields, and headlong sought the main! Then floated the wide palace full in view:— But where the features of one faithful Greek? The Hall of Audience had a charnel hue— And a low sound, from wasting sorrow weak, (Was it from lost Calirrhoe?) seem'd to break! Methought, already had the spider hung, (Safety in such a solitude to seek) Its dark webs, the deserted walls along, And in the desolate towers the owl her watchsong sung! And hark! thro' hall and gallery, chamber, court, A rush of trepidation!—Who is He?— The proud plumes, as to kiss the turrets, sport In air! And lo! he rides full royally! The bearers of the armorial ensignry, All horror-struck, unsteady in their tread, Reel to and fro amidst a purple sea! And is it not enough that seas are shed, And conquest roots her flags in mountains of the dead? Ah no! St. Sophia swims again to sight— The sultan, in carousal, far within, Here gives a young Greek to his fair one, bright In maiden beauty, whilst her blushes win From grisly Pashas round, the gaze, the grin! Stabb'd—in an instant stabb'd, the victims fall! The banquets end in blood, as they begin! And couples are dragg'd forth, 'till over all, E'en where the viands fume, is cast the trembling pall. These circumstances are omitted by Gibbon; but Eton seems to give credit to them. See Eton, pp. 145, 146—from Ricault. Voltaire (see Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations) vindicates Mahomet from the calumnies of Cardinal Isidore and others. Then, in its torporific folding blank, As Chaos did Oblivion wrapp the whole; Till, after years had lapsed, a prospect dank Dilated; like a spectre's sombre-stole, A huge mass, with no animating soul! The dense dull mist from off the tide of time, The cloudy volume, that appear'd to roll, Whilst thraldom quench'd the fire-clad thought sublime, Disclosed a store of grief, disclosed a store of crime. And Constantine now saw the scene expand As into time and space shot rapid light! Long ages were unlock'd at his command! And Greece, from Hæmus beyond Taurus height— All Greece—all Asia swam before his sight! And emerald seas with sunny isles embost; Here craggs from thunder molten; caverns white; And spiry groves, and mountains glazed with frost; And there receding cliffs, in purpled azure lost. Far o'er the riches of the imperial realm, Tho' meads and warbling woods with sweet accord Breathed airs of dalliance; yet did slavery whelm Its habitants with horrors of their lord! In each soft scene though Pleasure had her hoard; Yet, not so cheerless was the untravel'd waste, Or torrent that whirl'd down the glenrock roar'd. And say, where, where the monuments that graced The sculptor's peerless art, the architect's pure taste? Ah! marking tyranny's remorseless march, Erst each fair work where Taste and Genius view'd Each brilliant frieze, each finely-chisel'd arch, Each statue (from the mass her artists hew'd) Shaped into life—were all their glories strew'd Around; and died away in every gale Voices, that utter'd in desponding mood;— “Fall'n Athens! shall not Marathon avail To rouse thy drooping soul—to link the warrior-mail?” Still though its blooms the silver olive spread, Still flourishing beneath Minerva's towers; Unfading though Hymettus rear'd his head, Pouring wild fragrance from spontaneous bowers; Though murmuring from his aromatic flowers The honey-bee still bore the precious spoil; Yet there, where lagg'd the despot's lurid hours, Lethargic Plenty gleam'd a languid smile, And eyed the suffering slave, and triumph'd in his toil. Though some, where lorn Ilyssus ceas'd to glide, The tribute of a sigh to Plato paid; Though some still cherish'd the supernal pride That screen'd from vulgar gaze Lyceum's shade, And rov'd where once with Epicurus play'd The blue-ey'd Pleasures and their melting queen; Or bade the Porch their aspirations aid;— How soon, to demons muttering, intervene Murder and midnight lust and ignorance obscene. But wider to the Sovereign's fancy spreads His favourite terrace; cradling woods embrown The bourne, and hills familiar lift their heads; Where late (for others welfare, not his own) With no bold grasp he spann'd the proffer'd crown. Nigh Sparta's walls the Monarch seem'd to stray, Picturing, Leonidas! thy rugged frown, There, where Eurotas flash'd the indignant spray, To blades before unknown, The Turkish scymitar has a remarkable blade, differing from all the ancient weapons of war. and urged her moaning way. What though Arcadia blush to every breeze, And Mænalus weave the luxury of its shades, As if old Pan beneath his noonday trees Yet slumber'd; though Cyllene o'er the glades Her oak-glooms deepen, where the choral maids Hail'd the wing'd god of laughing Maia born? Who now with rose-hues wreathes the bowl? Who braids His sword with myrtles? Pipes to cheerful morn The shepherd? Is not joy of all its sunbeams shorn? Still in the genial Isles was nurs'd the fire, The fire of enterprise, to illumine Greece; Those ancient Isles, where fancy would inspire Songs of palestral palms and letter'd peace, And bid the sufferer's griefs a moment cease, Still shadowing out her Hector and her Troy, Her godlike Theseus, and her Golden Fleece— A Hector every sire! and every boy Blithe as Iulus tripp'd—all snatch'd ‘a fearful joy.’ O! if a new Anacreon seize the lyre, Eliciting from every living string The music of young Bacchus, and Desire, To thrill the revellers with a rapturous sting, Now ceasing to his neighbours of the ring Resign the mastery o'er extatic sound;— Stol'n are the festive moments that may wing Their airy flight! To sabres clashing round, The death-cord and the drug, shall Love or Pleasure bound? Changed is the vision'd scene. A radiance streams, As its roof opens, o'er a cedar'd room; Lo, a fair groupe conspicuous in the beams: Their silver distaffs glitter through the dome; Unveil'd the clustering locks, the virgin-bloom, Uncheck'd the pantings of the living snow: They laugh, they languish o'er the fervid loom— Alas! how reckless of the coming blow, The homage hiding shame, the smile that heralds woe! Lord of that mansion, if some liberal Greek, Heaven's blessings round him unsuspecting pour; With muffled oars glides by the dark caique, And ruffians, springing on the hapless Giaour, Chase joy and hope, and rifle all the bower! Soft with her velvet paw so steals unheard Where smiles the treachery of the sensual hour, Midst hills of cinnamon, through groves of nard, So strikes her victim dead, so strikes the prowling pard. O Scio! midst the desolating sweep Of massacre and flame, alas! 'tis thine The tears of very bitterness to weep! O Scio, whilst the dressers of thy vine Yet linger, midst luxuriance doom'd to pine, A sorer scourge than death 'tis theirs to bear! Thy mastics bloom; thy presses burst with wine! Thy breeze is incense!—Shall the roseate air Still fan thee? What art thou? What, but one sepulchre? See Eton's Survey of the Turkish Empire; particularly chap. ix. where I think the argument for the emancipation of the Greeks from Turkish tyranny, is unanswerable. See also chap. v. at pp. 145, 146. But, whilst in vision raged the turban'd host, Was there no knee in fond devotion bent, No eye, to mourn the mitre well nigh lost? Had ravaged Greece no Patriarch, to lament The veil of heavenly hope asunder rent? In listless slumbers did the priest recline? Whilst from the classic fane were sighings sent,— Alas! to deprecate the wrath divine, Did no lone orison ascend from sainted shrine? Yes! there were those in sacred wisdom wise— Yes! there were holy men of high desert, Whose morning vows, whose evening sacrifice Went up, the breathings of a contrite heart! But, wher so deep was hypocritic art, Where with the mass contention mingled leaven, The just award could some few prayers avert? Was it to some few stedfast spirits given, (Though palms their meed might be) to appease offended Heaven? Smitten before their shatter'd altars—curst By Moslems, where they call'd on death, to close Their mortal pilgrimage, as all athirst For those eternal palms their Spirits arose:— Yon hallow'd men despising earthly woes To rank with Antioch's martyrs calmly died! Yet e'en that little boon (the pale repose Beneath the green sod) were their trunks denied, Cast forth to the nightwinds, that cleave the troubled tide. Fierce as his brands pursue the parted soul, Whilst Azrael Azrael, the angel of destruction. The bridge of Al-Sirat— a slender filament, slight as the gossamer, trembling over floods of everlasting fire. all the landscape seem'd to scorch, And from old Ephesus to Istambol Fire, from Al-Sirat's flood, each crackling church; An angel-Spirit seem'd to snatch the torch Of ruin from the fiend!—Serene and soft A heavenly splendour fill'd St. Sophia's porch! A Mufti, as the crescent waver'd oft, Now sad to Mecca look'd, now rais'd his eyes aloft! Then from Epirus (which nor sourge could tame, Nor scymitar) to Antioch once its own, Was peal'd in solemn notes the Christian's name; And, from Thermopylæ to Macedon, Fields of proud worth a new Ulysses won; Whilst Islam temples were on temples heap'd: E'en from the tombs was torn the turban-stone, And the Lord's wrath, which had for ages slept, Whole cities with the scythe of desolation swept. From falling empires to fanatic reigns Was Constantine thus trembling, fluttering whirl'd; And hope or anguish hung o'er thrilling scenes, Soothed by a sun-gleam or thro' tempests hurl'd; When from an island glen, as blue waves curl'd Around the aërial form, he saw emerge A Spirit with lambent rainbows all impearl'd, And stand on tiptoe on a cliff's dim verge, And gild from glittering plumes, far gild the placid surge. The angel on a wreath of mist drew nigh, Look'd heavenly love, and said or seem'd to say: “Mourn not, O Prince, thy earthly destiny, With martyrs to thy glory snatch'd away! Thou shalt not witness the disastrous sway Of those whose paths are darkness. Pride and strife Shut from thy froward race, shut out the day: Feuds, rancorous feuds, among thy people rife Poison the etherial fount whence flow the streams of life. “Thou shalt not witness those portentous storms— The havoc ravaging thy towns—the stroke Disfeaturing the Creator's fairest forms: Thou shalt not witness that infernal smoke! Call'd by the Omnipotent (the Angel spoke, See Ezekiel xiv. 21, and the Revelations x. 1. Shuddering) His four sore judgments from the abyss To smite a guilty generation broke! And Peace greets Righteousness with holy kiss No more—where Hatred scowls, and Fraud and Faction hiss! “Woe—woe on earth! I hear the trumpet sound, Woe, woe! I see the shedding of men's blood! Let loose are the four angels which lay bound In that great river—in Euphrates' flood! And horsemen—who shall count the multitude? Their breastplates brimstone! Every horse—his head The lion's! Writhing like the viperous brood His scaly tail, and spreading—far to spread— Flame issues from each mouth—with Heaven's own vengeance red. “Thy suffering city—they shall eat the bread Of tears—and at the hand of God, the cup Of trembling—they shall drink the cup they dread— The very dregs—the dregs shall they drink up! Nor shall the fury that is gone forth, stop, Till all thy judges—all thy princes faint In every street—till all thy nobles drop! Till rise from each lone house the widow's plaint; Nor indignation spare the Apostle nor the Saint! “Lo! for a little season must it be! Saith thy Redeemer—saith the Lord! My face Yet a short moment have I hid from thee, Land of my people—of my chosen race! O wait awhile, my goodness shall not cease: The adamantine mountains shall decay, And the hills melt, and none shall know their place; Though never shall my mercies fade away, But shine, the light of life, to everlasting day. “Lo! wafted from the islands of the blest, The tidings of salvation shall come forth, Like Gilead's balm my healing from the West, And faithfulness—my buckler—from the North! Then, midst the lying wonders of the earth, Then shall in shame Mohammed hide his head, And all shall curse the base impostor's birth; As He, by whose right arm the dragon bled, Shall slay the murderous beast in Yathreb's venom bred. “Then ringing shall the voice of melody Echo from bower to bower, from vale to vale; From every habitation sorrow flee, And Health and Peace and Joy the righteous hail; And springs of living waters never fail, And the lign-aloes fling their shadows there! Then Sharon's rose shall incense every gale; And the great Shepherd in his arms shall bear The lambs of Israel's flock, his own peculiar care!” MISCELLANEOUS VERSE; SERIOUS AND LUDICROUS. Miscentur seria ludo. THE FOURTH OF MARCH. This, and the six following poems, are from “Floral Offerings,” of which a few copies only were printed, in honour of the Royal Horticultural Society of Cornwall; whose first meeting was held at Truro, on the 29th of June, 1832. 1813. March! how mild thy genial hours, Soft azure skies, and gilded showers; The blaze of lights, the deepening shade, Tints that flush the cloud and fade; Now the young wheat's transient gleam, Where sunfits, chasing shadows, stream; Now in quick effulgence seen, On yonder slope its sparkling green; And, sprinkled o'er the mossy mould, Crocuses, like drops of gold; And the lent-lily's paler yellow Where flowers the asp and water-willow; And the polyanthus, fair Its hues, as bath'd in summer air; And the white violets, that just peep, And, shelter'd by the rosemary, sleep; Bursting lilacs, and beneath Currant-buds, that freshly breathe The first spring-scent, light gooseberry leaves With which the obtrusive ivy weaves Its verdure dark—this day, tho' late Cut off, to meet a cruel fate— The cherry spray, that purpling glows, And, full of leaf, the hedge-row rose; On this south wall the peach-bloom pale, Where huddles many a clustering snail; And round the trunk of yon hoar tree, Here and there, a humming bee That wanders to the sunny nook, Or seeks, hard by, the glittering brook; The black-bird's trill, and every lay That warbling wild love, dies away; And on each ash and elm's gray crest, Cawing rooks, that frame the nest Anew, or with parental care Their cradles worn by time repair; And lambs that o'er the meadow, brisk, Tug at the teat, and run and frisk; These, this moment, meet my eyes, Or my charmed ear surprise— Sounds that melt, and sights that seem To wave o'er winter like a dream. Yet, ere in recent brightness born, The moon shall fill her silver horn, Clear as now we hail the rays Where evening's crimson vest decays; Yet shall thy storm, impetuous March! In blackness shroud the etherial arch, Sweep those dewy meads serene, And rifle all this garden-scene; Yet, if bloom the vermeil peach, Tawny-leav'd we mark the beech! Yes! but yester-morn, were driven Veiling the refulgent heaven, What numerous starlings down the waste As when howl'd the embattled blast! Then, shall we not, my Mary! seize Fleeting pleasures, such as these? Scar'd by winds and rushing rain, Will Spring visit us again? Are we sure, when floods subside, This amber stream shall dimpling glide, And again so softly steal Thro' floral tufts, to yonder dale? May not, where icebolts cease to beat, The young shoots droop in summer-heat; Scantier creep the languid rill, And the vocal bowers be still? Then, let us ravish, ere it fly, Bliss so fugitive, so coy; Muse on each colour's opening glow, Trace the blossoms as they blow; Listen to the choral grove, And drink the soul of life and love; Shall we not, my Mary! seize Fleeting pleasures, such as these? THE SNOWDROPS. A deceased sister and myself had pleasure in a little garden which from long desertion was overgrown with briars and brambles, and ground-ivy. But our hedgerow nook retained its peculiar feature, after the lapse of more than sixty years. The snowdrop was here our favourite flower. That the trace of a snowdrop, however, or of any other flower was here discoverable, I could not conceive. Yet here I found a tuft of snowdrops in January 1829. 1829. Yet can I the cold fancies brook Which specious fashion links with taste, Whilst from this long-forsaken nook Starts many a dream of pleasure past? Alas! if smoothing all the slope, I bid the sheltering hedge lie low, 'Tis but to give an ampler scope To that dark wind, our dreaded foe. But, whether the drear eddying West, Or Boreas howl or grimly sleep; A tenderer feeling shall arrest The leveller's unrelenting sweep. Oh! relic of a Sister's bower Of all its blooms so rudely shorn, Where oft we wooed the fragrant hour At evening close or break of morn; Where light the warbler of the glen Nestled or sung, no longer shy; Nor heeded our protected wren The jealous redbreast rustling nigh; Where hyacinths, the hedge beneath, And, midst its briars above, blue bells And honeysuckles loved to breathe Pure incense from their dulcet cells: And e'en, as now, where sharp the blast Shook from the sprays a glittering shower Of icicles, the spot we trac'd To spy out the first infant flower. And is it so? Midst moss and fern, (Sure, 'tis illusion mocks my sight!) Shall my dim eyes again discern— Type of her soul—their virgin white? But, are ye, Snowdrops! sprung from those (To pensive memory, oh! how dear) Once clustering—cradled amid snows, Sweet heralds of the purpling year! Say, are ye to the awakened gaze Of fond affection kindly given, To bring back my departed days. Or lingering still, or dropt from Heaven? Not pearls for so divine a gift— The pearls of Ormuz—would I take! And lo! the pleading eye they lift! “Preserve us for a sister's sake!” Yes!—by that lucid sense, that voice— Its every cadence treasur'd here— Her hymns that bade my heart rejoice— Her every smile—her every tear— By every prayer her life to save, When sinking in the arms of death— By all the sighs which o'er her grave Were heav'd, as pale I gasp'd for breath; Oh! by the kindling hope to spare In realms, where sorrow hath no lot, Her everlasting love, I swear That I will shield this sacred spot Till palsy grasp each trembling limb, With Faith aspiring to the skies, And holy Peace—the “cherubim” To guard my little Paradise! I had considered the above as merely an effusion of fancy and feeling;—not at all aware, that snowdrops could have existed so long in the ground—upwards of sixty years, till in the Journal of a Naturalist I read the following: “The snowdrop remains the only memorial of man and his labours, a melancholy flower; reminding us of some deserted dwelling, a family gone, a hearth that smokes no more!” RURAL SCENERY. From amber clouds as Hesper bright Mingled with the morning light, Sweet May! I saw thy orient blush! And lo! that crimson flush O'er wave and rock and cavern riv'n, These dimwood shades which fragrance breathe Fresh as they kiss the sod beneath, The daisied mead, its glittering dews, A bliss so pure effuse, I cry—It is almost a Heaven! The lime's young foliage; green and red Sycamores, that soon shall spread Their broader leaves; and richly brown, Yon oak's aspiring crown; The vigorous chesnut that hath thriven Sustain'd by my assiduous care, Waving its hyacinths in air; And kindling far down yonder combe, The blaze of apple-bloom— Oh! doth not this resemble Heaven? There, twinkling from her dizzy height Soars the lark, nor dreads the kite; With hawthorn deck'd see Susan's pail: And now the wheels I hail, Crashing and crazed, which Hodge had striven To disengage where deep the wain Had sunk amidst the hollow lane.— Now bleating o'er the barley-blade The lambs that lawless stray'd— These rural sights and sounds are Heaven And from that nook, my playful boys! Whilst I view your blameless joys, This little fellow, who the cuckoo Now mimics—its blithe echo— I steal delight unmixt with leaven! Now up he starts, his brother jostling, And wild pursues the yellow gosling, Now laughs, and mimics with a bound The colt that wantons round— Say, is not this a little Heaven? And on yon slope the Cornflower's hue— How he eyes their glowing blue; Then stares with wonder, leaps with pleasure, As azure light on azure Mounts up, tho' by no zephyr driven! They are, my boy! gay butterflies, That woo the Cornflowers ere they rise, Then seem to mock their loves below, And flutter, to and fro!— To note thy sweet surprise, is Heaven! Thy quiet brother, with less bustle Feeds his finch and warbling throstle; Tends his tame hare, and fits his hooks For trout in hazy brooks! O may I hope to be forgiven If with my scampering boys I rove In search of nests thro' glen or grove, And traverse thorny brakes and bushes, Or banks o'ergrown by rushes— If still I deem such pleasures—Heaven! My heart—my cherish'd heart is glad! Yet, through all the conscious shade, A warning whisper seems to say From every trembling spray: “Remember! thou art sixty-seven! Tho' scenes so fair thy fancy please, Yet can'st thou trust thy feeble knees? To thee shall May's sweet morn restore Its balms—perhaps no more! Thou must not deem such pleasures—Heaven.” THE HORTICULTURAL BARD. O read these lines. From him who loves The glenwood streams Flumina amem sylvasque. —Geor.

'Tis then, the sultry hour o'erpast, Thou lov'st to lift thy head, My evening-friend! so calm, so chaste, Sweet primrose of the shade! And I have seen thro' glimmering dew The silent glow-worm steal, And, one clear drop of lustre blue, Hang on thy petals pale. O now again thy placid eyes To twilight cool unclose! So may I give, with all its sighs, This bosom to repose. Yet, not in self absorb'd and lone, To others I impart The pleasures from reflection won, To cheer the social heart.

(A competition pleasant) I offer to your imitation The old Corycian peasant. In elder days this swain did flourish Where flows the black Galesus; And bade its banks his garden nourish, Far happier than a Crœsus! For sheep or kine too poor, his ground Beneath his native hill, he Planted, outvying all around, The vervain and white lily. Lilia verbenasque.Geor. lib. iv. v. 131.

Without much trouble or much cost He rear'd the polyanthus, And e'en amidst the winter's frost, Would shear the soft acanthus. And so prolific his pear-trees— (You may cry out “O lud!”) He had—believe me, if you please— A pear Quotque in flore novo— ? totidem in autumno. v. 143. for every bud.

Admitted to witness a grand Exhibition, Where all of one mind with no politics grapple, I am sure, we had fruits fit for every condition, From the cucumber up to the princely pine-apple. With William—the King—our munificent patron— We stoop not, ye Critics! your favour to curry; But while flirt the misses, and bounces the matron, O Hellas! our Flora may rival thy Furry! Wedg'd in as I was, from my heels to my head, By swarthy plebeians, and men of high quality, I look'd all around, and a lesson I read— In every big cabbage or neap, “a morality.” Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.”Shakspeare. To a dish of green gooseberries quickly the palm Was adjudg'd, and to pinks, and to flow'r after flow'r; And to bunches of grapes, but I could not be calm, In ripeness tho' luscious—alas! they were sour! Forbidden (how hard!) or to taste or to touch, (I confess it with shame!) I was prompted to thieve: For me the temptation was almost too much, In frailty, I fear, a true daughter of Eve! THE FLORA BALL. Hail to the Dancer's chaste delight! But I have heard (perhaps 'tis false) Ye fondly welcom'd, yester night, My lovely girls! The Phallic Waltz. I would not, for a moment, damp Your mounting spirits, nor marr your glee; I would not quench the festal lamp,— Far be such rigour—far from me! Go, light of heart! Be yours the pleasures That youth and innocence inspire: For you the muse has dulcet treasures; The melodies of lute and lyre. And, if I meet the soft blue languish, The glances arch from eyes of sloe; The blush that soothes the lover's anguish; The flaxen hair's luxuriant flow; For you whose vows affection breathes In many a sigh sincere, be mine To consecrate the rosy wreathes That bloom o'er Hymen's gifted shrine. And may the mutual ardour throw O'er life that dear delicious spell Which they alone can ever know Who sigh'd so oft, and loved so well. Then listen to my sage advice (And yet I think the rumour false), Nor deem me scrupulous or precise— Abjure, dear girls! abjure the Walz. Mrs. Butler (Fanny Kemble), who in her late publication has thrown more light on America than any former traveller, promised Dr. ? never “to walz again, except with a woman or her brother.” The Walz, under all its modifications, is no other than the Phallic Dance; which a truly modest woman would blush even to name. It was the very dance even of the courtezans of Corinth—the strumpets of Babylon—the harlots of Jerusalem. —[see Ezekiel.] I have heard of a lady, who flung down Fanny Kemble's book in disdain, because poor Fanny had “wished somebody at the devil.” Qu? Has this lady objected to the walz? A FRAGMENT. Hark, as I touch the harmonicon— —Its keys, to pain or pleasure; The wires unseen Without an effort won, Give back a corresponding measure; Thus from the secret bosom—from within— Spontaneous modulations rise Which seem to symphonize With present joys or griefs, and tell What shall befall from what befell; Which speak of bliss to come, Or antedate our doom! Yes! here I feel—I feel the strings That vibrate or to joy or woe! I feel the chord that brings The future to my sense: its whisperings show Responsive to the present and the past, How my horoscope is cast! And ah! what intimations fill My soul with sad presentiments of ill? The music of the nerve of mournful tone Dies not away unanswer'd,—nor alone Is by the sorrower heard; But from a nerve conceal'd I hear, in thrilling unison, The voice of things yet unreveal'd! O as I heave the sigh That would in kind relief Soften my actual grief; It calls forth others from the trembling chord That runs into futurity— Others which all unbidden part From this harmonicon—my heart! THE RILL LOST IN A THICKET. Again, the gurgling rill I hear, By brambles screen'd and deep in fern: A friend, objecting to the second line, when I presented him with these versions:— “Again my warbling rill I hear In coppice deep, where darkness broods: Its lulling music meets my ear— My eye its lingering lapse eludes.” “Again my long-lov'd rill I hear;— The o'er-hanging copse its canopy: Its plaintive music meets my ear— Its lapse eludes my straining eye.” He preferred this to the other two. Yet “by brambles screened,” &amp;c. &amp;c. is the exact description of a little stream which used to glitter to the morning sun, but of which, overgrown as it now is by brambles, furze and fern, not a glimpse is to be seen. Its long-loved music meets my ear— Its lapse can straining eye discern? So Time has flung a veil between The brisk career of youth and me; And seems to murmur—“what hath been, “Ah never—never more shall be!” Yet fain—O fain would I restore The dancing of a gladsome day, As thus, though it be seen no more, Its distant echo dies away! A GOOD CONSCIENCE. O grant me, Lord! that sweet repose, Which from approving Conscience flows; A Conscience spotless from offence, Which gives us, with the enlighten'd sense Of charity to all mankind, To serve Thee with a quiet mind; Which shall for aye our moments bless As pain we lull, and soothe distress, And of each act, whate'er it be, Ascribes the merit all to Thee! Oh! it is Conscience, clear and calm, For every trouble hath a balm; And, whilst “the wicked stalk abroad,” Resigns us to “the peace of God.” 'Tis like the blaze, that lights the walls Of hamlets or of loftier halls— The genial blaze, though round were gloom, That brightens up our tranquil home: Without, the dreary winds may roar; The cheerful hearth but charms the more! To Dr. DARWIN. “While Sargent See Sargent's “Mine,” a poem. flings around his curious eyes, Winding through many a subterranean maze; And, as he bids entrancing forms arise, With wizard light the mineral kingdoms blaze; Behold! amidst the vegetable bloom, O Darwin! thy ambrosial rivers flow; And suns more pure the fragrant earth illume, As all the vivid plants with passion glow. Yes! wheresoe'er with life creation teems, I trace thy spirit thro' the kindling whole; Whilst with a genial splendour to the beams Of Science, isles emerge and oceans roll, And Nature, in primordial beauty, seems Inspir'd by thee to breathe a renovated Soul! The following Sonnet was about the same time addressed to Cowper; who cordially united with Darwin and Hayley in expressing sentiments complimentary to “the Muse of Devon,” and honoured me with a correspondence highly flattering. To COWPER. “Cowper! to thee the Muse of Devon bears A rustic offering. On the green-hill tops, And in the tufted combes, beside the brooks, She gather'd many a floret; and, retir'd Fast by a Druid's chasmed rock that frown'd O'er the dark waters of impetuous Teign, She wove this various garland in the light Of the pale moon; as in dim rounds discern'd (Where open'd, far within, a pendent wood) The tripping Feri twinkled. Such the wreath She consecrates to thee! And, tho' its hues Be oft too glaring to thy purer eye, Perchance the primrose and the vi'let, there May lurk, in modest tints, not unperceiv'd!” To J. W. CROKER, Esq. Just after I had been introduced to him by Davies Gilbert, at Pearce's Hotel, in 1820. O thou, whose talents over scutchion'd birth, A splendour, to adorn thy lineage, shed— (Though Devon calls thy hoary fathers forth, High-helm'd, and glories in transmitted worth) Thou, from whose patriot flame by honour fed, Scared Faction shrinks, and hides its viperous head, Accept this strain, unpolish'd yet sincere! Nor less to thee the Muse her tribute brings, For that thy fancy, midst the effulgent sphere Of poesy, unfolds her genial wings— For that thy heart is conscious to the tear That trembling starts to taste and feeling dear! Whilst to proud notes, to swell the pomp of Kings, Echoeing o'er vale and hill, thy “Talavera” rings! SONNETS To a person threatening to shoot the wood pigeons at Polwhele. I. [The days are come, when querulous old age] The days are come, when querulous old age Mourning its past delights, you little deem How trivial are the things its heart engage, And bid it, like the illusion of a dream, Grasp at a fleeting image well nigh gone! I always prized the feather'd tribe. Their note, Their plumes, I hail'd in glens recluse and lone. But in the haunts of all that “pour the throat,” The gurgling Wooddove have I valued most; And oft, as scarce a care my bosom cross'd, Myself unnoticed, I have mark'd with glee The neck's blue glossiness, the purple breast; And, in the hollow of my grandsire's tree, A hollow oak, in which the wood pigeons had a nest every year. Espied with eager eye the simple nest. II. [Down to the depth of that umbrageous dell] Down to the depth of that umbrageous dell I cannot now descend with feeble knees: Yet may I catch the sounds I loved so well: And the wild melodies that wont to please My ear, yet linger like a fairy spell. I cannot for the nest with curious glance Look thro' my grandsire's oak, that shades the rill. But with emotions that renew the boy Each summer eve, when all around is still, The plaintive cooings yet my soul entrance! Then menace not with murderous aim, to kill The innocuous inmates of my tranquil groves, That in deep mellow murmurs tell their loves— As the last echoes of my youthful joy. A CORNISH INCIDENT. Where screamed the sea-gull and the heron A body was wash'd in at Piran: Squire Ned stole slily down to see What peradventure it might be; When, lo! a female hand struck Neddy— Besure, thought he, a handsome lady! As with a brilliance strange it shone, He look'd around; and all alone Was charm'd by many a precious stone; Nor did he for a moment linger, To scrape acqaintance with a finger; Tho,' tugging at each tempting ring, He cried: “By jingo, how they cling! What's best to do?—'tis mighty puzzling! Still will I try—tho' dead, she's dazzling! Diamond and emerald, ruby, sapphire— “They'll buy me many a fine fat yaffer!” And muttering: “'Tis so rare a morsel— So dainty—I dont wish the corse ill— A luxury of so great a price!” Our hero mouth'd, and nothing nice, Bit off the finger in a trice: And now from tinner fast on tinner Squire Ned slunk back, a conscious sinner, Inter arenosa loca— Then whoop'd—“saw—saw ye not a phoca?” Ned had secur'd the rings—no noddy— The seal was welcome to the body. Yet seal was never seen, 'twas said; And hence they named him “phoca Ned!” But Ned had made a lucky hit, And chuckled over the tit-bit. Not many generations have passed away, since the Cornish country squires have had no objection to share in the rich wrecks that blessed their lucky shores. What is here commemorated, was a real incident. Squire Ned was a progenitor of one of the most ancient families in Cornwall. In his days a country squire had just “larning” enough to know, that “phoca was Latin” for a seal; whilst he used the provincialisms of the lowest farmers—whit for white— “yaffer” for heifer.

When a babe is your echo—not quite three years old, “He's a radical, and must be kickt!” This is literally a fact. A gentleman said of another—“He is a radical, and deserves to be kicked,” in the presence of his little boy, not quite three years old. Several months after, the radical called at the gentleman's house, when the child immediately as he entered the parlour, ran to him and kicked him. “How is this?” cried the father—“What's the matter?” “Why you said you know—he's a radical, and must be kicked.” The gentleman did not recollect that he ever said it. But this clever little fellow, I dare say, was probably right. THE DEAN; OR SNUFF-COURTSHIP. This was an impromptu on a worthy Dean, who won a fair lady by his graceful manœuvres in taking snuff. Descending in a golden shower, Great Jove came down to Danae's tower. Our Dean, who deals in other stuff, Carries his point by showers of snuff; And though, in sooth, low people trust, As they make love, to yellow dust, And think not, to supply the lack O! Of gold, by pinches of tobacco; And from the tasteful test would flinch, If put thus nicely to the pinch; Yet, with such pretty playful knocks Our worthy Dean did rap his box, And cast Pulveris exigui jactu. about him with such grace, And such a pleasant “power of face,” An odour to outvie the rose, From particles Divinæ particulam auræ that miss'd his nose, That soon in palpable reality He proved its titillating quality. In short he felt, attach'd to Nation, The great dealer in snuff. The fine effect of titillation.

You ask me how? Then put it to the trial— And lo! just half a sovereign in a rial! Lan-deu-wednac—the black and white church; consisting of whitish granite and dark-coloured serpentine alternately disposed —a sort of chequerwork. It is surprising that our etymologists should have been all puzzled about the meaning of the word— so obvious on a view of the building. This, however, was the case. Old Sandys of the Lizard was “weary with conjectures.” LANDEUWEDNAC. We all recollect the anecdote of Busby, at Westminster, asserting the sovereign, even in the Royal presence.

DIE OF THE DOCTOR. “The Doctor! the Doctor!” he made such a rout, But now he's clean gone, all is coming about; The pulse in each patient, too quick or too slow, The moan of despondence, the visage of woe— Where are they?—Say, where is the tic doloureux? 'Twas his ominous phiz of dire import that shock'd her!— And well nigh my daughter had “died of the Doctor!” THE DOCTOR TURNED PATIENT. Good Sir! the pillbox, gallipot and phial, Must erelong put my pocket to the trial. Ponderous the package I've just sent away— O what a sum (thinks I) the deuce to pay! Yet though so many a potion—many a pill— To an enormous size swell out your bill; Long suffering, (but I fancy on the fret), You whisper not a word about my debt.

THE SONNET OUT OF JOINT. It happen'd about a lugubrious opuscle An old Bard of Truro was making a bustle, In hot agitation exclaiming: “Fie on it! The blunder hath spoil'd the effect of my sonnet: The Devil had come with a proof, very sly— Said the Bard to the Devil—“You 've put out my Eye!” “See under”—'Tis only cast down,” quoth the Devil, With a grin on his countenance rather uncivil. “'Tis not cast away—though perhaps on the brink; At a slip Sir! so slight, may we hope you will wink? I cannot but say that it seems all awry— And well may we call it a cast of the Eye.” “Cast down, to be sure! But, good Sir, to be righted If you wish, in a twinkling we'll make you upsighted! And, bless me! it seems after all to belong To a “multitude”—yea to the deuce of a throng! So, whate'er from above or below it espy, Old Argus, to this, scarcely had a cat's eye.” Cried the Poet—“For such an abuse of your types, And your pert repartees, you deserve many stripes!” And he bluster'd yet more in a fume, till at last The Devil himself, like his types, was downcast: And from flagellation, exceedingly shy, Sneak'd away, on the Bard as he cast a sheep's-eye. “Stop—stop—you should know (said the gray Sonneteer) To me and my race reputation is dear; I tell you—(the Devil look'd shrewd and asquint) 'Tis of moment to me, tho' you see nothing in't. Provoking!”—when whisper'd a Wag who stood by, “Hold your tongue—no more nonsense—'tis all in my eye!” The above sonnet was so printed. See the ninth line, in which “every eye” occurred instead of the preceding line. It is literally a fact, that the printer's devil brought me a proof, with this dislocation, but disregarded my correction. THE SONNET. [Written on Tuesday, between the hours of 3 and 4, during the tolling of the minute-bell at St. Mary's, at the approach of Lord De Dunstanville's Funeral Procession.] Dunstanville!—Is it not the funeral knell That seems to gather visionary glooms, Deepening the shadows of the nodding plumes O'er “down and dale,” to where thy Fathers rest? Again—again I hear its solemn swell, Sad monitor of frail mortality! O in that stillness—in that sudden pause “Without a breath”—O is there not the applause To shame the shouts of millions!

I have seen so many rock basins in Devon and Cornwall, evidently not artificial—in similar situations with those on Karnbre—that I cannot but protest against all that Borlase has conjectured on the subject. That sublime moonlight picture of Stonehenge, which I had in memory, but could no where find—and in search of which I have repeatedly sent my literary correspondents, I danced almost for joy on discovering, as quoted by Borlase from “West's Inst. of the Garter”— ? those stupendous monuments That oft amaze the wandering traveller, By the pale moon discern'd on Sarum's plain.

Buried beneath Napoleon's willows, My two late housedogs lie buried near the spot where my son planted a slip or two which he had plucked from Buonaparte's willow at St. Helena. Here rest two very faithful fellows. High names they nobly bore, or else on Cæsar, they “made a lie,” Whosoever maketh a lie. and Nelson! If ask'd of each—why stole he on The relics of Napoleon— I answer, that to rival Bony, They flush'd a cock or chased a coney; Both in pursuit of licens'd game. Sure was their scent, and just their aim. And I am certain that our Cæsar To puff up Vanity, or ease her, Ne'er wrote a Commentary-tattle, To tell us all about a battle; And that our Nelson, not for booty, Did (more than every man) his duty. This resembles one of the epitaphs in Theocritus—“the sweet Sicilian Bard”—“done into English” by me 55 years ago. My translation was asleep, I believe. But a kind Critic in Fraser's admirable Magazine has just awakened it from its slumbers. He thought, too, I was lost in the delirium of old age stealing from life.—Alas! it is far otherwise! ON HEARING AN ASS BRAY. THE SURE SIGN OF A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER. Thus an Ass in the political hemisphere:— Heard ye a hoot across the heather? It augurs ill; nor deem it strange That in the times, as in the weather, We thus forbode an ominous change: Midst those who brawl about Reform, The braying Ass portends a storm. This was one of the corporation squibs played off from time to time during the tortures of disfranchisement. THE DEFUNCT CORPORATION. Oct. 9, 1835. ? “Oh! gone—for ever gone— (It squeak'd)—the glorious days! All bone and muscle Am I; who once with such a bulky bustle Amidst the million stalk'd—a mighty Burgess! My voice of thunder beating Boanerges! “Farewell the pomp (to excel a raree-show) When marshall'd in array we loved to go, Like four-and-twenty fiddlers in a row!” “This, as he strode with desultory pace, Eyeing asquint the consequential mace; That puff'd, tho' limping from a gouty twinge, With all the flatulence of silk and fringe!” “Alas! heart-breaking to depict our woe, is— But ‘fuimus’ we were—we once were ‘Troes’! Long since our thumb-rings In proof of the bodily hugeness of the Emperor Maximius the Elder, his thumb is recorded to have been so large, as to bear upon it his Queen's right hand bracelet for a ring. [Hist. Aug. Scriptores, 606. Capitolinus.] We know an Alderman's thumb-ring to have been an object familiar to the eyes of Shakspeare. [Arch. III. 390, Sir Jos. Ayloffe, and Shakspeare's Part I. of Henry IV. Act II. Scene IV.] “When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an Eagle's talon in the waist: I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring.” An Alderman's thumb-ring is mentioned by Brome, in the Antipodes, 1640; again in the Northern Cap, 1632; again in Wit in a Constable, 1640. See Johnson and Steevens's Edit. 1793, Vol. VIII. 463. Light gold, and crack'd within the ring. [Ben. Jons. Magn. Lady.] Flawed in such a manner as to diminish its value. Here we are reminded of the days of Bamber Gascoigne; when a cloud seemed to hang over the Borough. But it was soon dissipated. had portentous cracks; But now our gowns are stript from off our backs!” —From a melting cloud soft Pity stoop'd, To mark in twilight Consultation grouped Those whom we honour, though with laughing eyes, Not on the “bridge of asses” but “of sighs!” We laugh at their awkward situation, whilst we lament the annihilation of their official dignity. The Borough of Truro has been always considered as the most respectable of all the corporations in the Western Counties. Not an instance of any peculation— of any wanton expenditure of the public money—of any abuse of power, has occurred, I believe, in the history of our Municipal Government. The dissolution, therefore, of the political existence of a corporate body, who, following the steps of their predecessors, well merit the gratitude of “faithful Cornwall,” (for their influence in Cornwall is of no mean account) must be the subject of regret and indignation with all who wish well to old England. With respect to the sepulchral emblems, the playfulness of the Muse must be taken as it was meant—mere jocularity. No human being is faultless. But I cannot charge any individual in the present groupe with the slightest deviation from all that is just and fair and honourable among men. Lo! the hour comes (for dogs must have their day) When all the Corporation shall be clay. 'Tis then around each honourable grave Some emblematic plant may wind or wave. Here, o'er this stone shall creep the clasping hops; There speckled foxgloves shall unclose their cups! And there the specious heliotrope, that won By splendour, turns to court the rising sun. Yet shall, its loftiness brought low, the plane No more aspire to kiss the steeple—vane; Yet shall yon elm, whose trunk had once increas'd (The fine effect of many a venison-feast) To such a vast circumference, that our Rector Thence oft deduced a moralizing lecture, No more o'er half the graves its branches fling, But sympathize in death with Church and King: Yet the tall poplar, (erst with fatness fed) As shrivel up its roots and droops its head, Shall in the poor defunct set sadly forth, How hath declin'd the Borough's festal worth; And the sick Alder in consumption show, Meet type! its meagre Alder-man below! NOT DEAD BUT DYING. “Yet,” (cried a voice that issued, I declare If not from the Town-steward, The first Recorder, under Elizabeth's charter, bearing date 1589, was Robert Trencreeke of Treworgan, whose daughter Catherine married Degory son of John Polwhele, M.P. for the county of Cornwall. By this marriage, Treworgan became the property of the Polwhele family. The last Recorder we venerate in the Earl of Falmouth (“Not dead, but dying.”) Among the capital Burgesses we find names of high respectability. Avery [1689]; Ennys, Foote, Polwhele, [1722]; Hussey, Mander, Coster, Thomas, Lemon, [1731]; Vivian, Conon, Macormick, Rosewarne, Cardew, Pellew, Boscawen, Russell, Luxmore, Hoblyn, Daubuz, Carlyon, &amp;c. &amp;c.

Gregor, Hussey, and Mander were likewise Townclerks. from the Mayor) “We'll put, as well-nigh finish'd is our course, A recent Act The first operation under the new Act, &amp;c. for improving the Borough, was a public notice, (in which as a justice, &amp;c. I was desired to join the Mayor) that “all dogs suffered to go at large through the streets would be destroyed.” It was reported that the constables, &amp;c. had slighted our order. But this was not a fact. A great number of dogs were seized, &amp;c. of Parliament in force. Ere yet (he foam'd and flash'd as passion work'd— So brown-stout foams and flashes when uncork'd) Ere yet (he cough'd and spat with short quick breath And seem'd to dart the lightning ?

Ray inserts it as a proverb,—“It's a lightning before death.” before death)— Ere yet we quite expire—(each passer by Hints with a sneer, ‘not dead, but soon to die.’)— Against the race canine we set our faces, In spite of inuendoes or grimaces; And (sure a deed to grace the civic wreath) We'll hang up every dog that shews his teeth! Say not to tortering Power it gives no help, To drown a mongrel or dispatch a whelp; But hold your tongues; nor thus with shrugs on shrugs, Suggest that you are now akin to dogs. Quick, constables! scent out and shoot the terriers!

Fair. a slur: We, who eftsoon shall hold the sovereign sway— Shall big Tenpounders tremble and obey?” Scarce could the menace from his mouth escape, Ere, each abandoning his proper shape, He and his myrmidons, not more imbruted, Were on a sudden into dogs transmuted! And lo! his Worship, scowling as in scorn, Himself transform'd, perceiv'd a sprouting horn, And felt his branching honours, and with dread Stamp'd his slim legs, and shook his antler'd head! Opening in many a wild unearthly tongue, Bloodhounds and beagles at his haunches hung; And, flesh'd in carnage, had attack'd his throat, But for a most arresting shrilling note! Panier'd and ginger-tail'd from Mevagizzy, In selling plaice and pikes a Jackass busy, Was struck (since man or ass a hubbub strikes) And in a panic flung down all his pikes! Prick'd up his brother asses their long ears, And bray'd outrageous as to rend the spheres! The obstreperous hooting thrill'd all Lemon-street, Pierc'd Donkey-bridge, and linger'd o'er the Leet, And swam back tremulous from Tregolls, and won An echo more distinct from Alverton. From house to house the strange commotion spread; From creaking casements poked out many a head— Gray gossips (who besure had heard an ass— Not so uproarious) wonder'd what it was! Smart milliners, who well nigh lost their wits, Or fluttering fell into hysteric fits; And 'prentic'd girls (whom lovesick sighs bewitch, Skim the light gauze and flit from stitch to stitch), Who dream, as stealthy twilight shuts their shops, Of assignations in Bosvigo-copse; Rous'd from their soothing reveries, look'd round, And “thought a Damon sobb'd in every sound.” Strait in the tumult fled, and strain'd to flee on The wings as of the wind—so fled Actæon! In full cry follow'd by the yelping crew, The Radicals—the Destructives!— ? Ea turba cupidine prædæ Per rupes, scopulosque adituque carentia saxa, Qua via difficilis, quaque est via nulla feruntur! O'er half the town his horned Worship flew! On mux or pilm macadamizing tramp'd, And on three Radicals in fury stamp'd— Base grovellers, who lay floundering; in the lurch Left, where he erst was throned, St. Mary's Church, And seem'd the clouds to sever in his flight, Now as he gain'd the Castle's topmost height; And now descending smoked down Goody-Lane, And whirling smash'd out windows, pane on pane. One little moment cheer'd: “Avaunt, avaunt!” He would have cried, and toss'd his beaming front, And over Daubuz-moors with rapid strides Shook the sick sweat-drops from his dappled sides. Yet nearer, hot upon his Worship's breech,— He would have cried, but had no power of speech: “Full soon will you deplore this dire disaster! “Ah! cruel! can you massacre your master?” Actæon ego sum! dominum cognoscite vestrum? When he laid sprawling, by one desperate blow, Agriolos—and next Hylactor low. ? The hounds around him close; The “big-round tears” Lacrymæque per ora non sua fluxerunt. —Ovid. roll down his “innocent nose:” But pitiless are all the factious folks— To such “the big round tears” are only jokes! Lo! Onesiphorus assail'd the shank, And Pterilas and Thoas, either flank, And fierce Theridamas, besmear'd with gore, His quivering windpipe all asunder tore; And “mercy! mercy!” with imploring eye In vain he craved, and laid him down to die; And, (what of stags, wherever born or bred, Or e'en of Mayors is very seldom said) Heaved his last death-groan—on a Featherbed! One of the boundaries of the Borough. The Mayor and Corporation perambulating the Borough, halt at Featherbed in Kenwyn, and perform certain ceremonies. Oct. 1835. “GOING—GOING—GONE!” The timid will no longer fawn. “The snarling dog—his teeth are drawn: Now, let him try with all his might; He still may growl, but cannot bite.” Whilst some look silly, others sly on, All would insult the old sick Lion. No sooner was this thought or said, Than flew the intelligence—“He 's dead.” Here then (as not a cur that greets His feverish Phillis in the streets; Or Selima, that caterwawls To mingle in the midnight brawls; Or harlot that, for love or chink, Cooes, hovering round a kidliwink; Or rompish Miss, that, willy-nilly, Draws after her a Locke or Lilly, By moonshine seen to kiss and squeeze,— Enough indeed to raise the breeze; Or, having in his brain a twist, Horsedoctor, or ventriloquist, Of weightier matter for the lack, But sets a going the town-clack.)— Here—in presuming is it vanity That, (gossips!) amid such inanity— Poor humble I—may take my turn, And nine days at oblivion spurn? I mean—if dragg'd, another Hector, Nine times from theatre to lecture, From brilliant ball to public breakfast, Nine times—till left alone to stick fast— May serve, in buskin, sock or sandal, To feed the appetite for scandal,— And victim to a girl's vagary, Per ora virum volitare?

The tables “spreading” in my lays, All peradventure, their “green” baize! This, if supposed to allude to the scriptural “spreading like a green bay tree,” may imply something more. Of the gambler it may be said, he was spreading—he was fluorishing”—but lo! he was gone! I sought him, and his place could no where be found.” Or rather I'm not such an oaf, as To dream, that she at once ten sofas,— Ten Ottomans (say more or less) Could with her own sweet bottom press. “Have you not heard, it chill'd my blood,” Squall'd one of the stale sisterhood, “Old Fudge died suddenly at five? “I've miss'd the deal, as I'm alive! “They say his sister's in the dumps! “But my good friend, pray, what are trumps? “Oh!

One only, who was seldom quiet, Whose tongue from morn to night ran riot, (That little member,—which—so fell— So foul—is set on fire of hell) One only (it seems) almost throttled By syllables too closely bottled, And with the feeling of a spasm, From jabbering to supply the chasm, Where her throat rued the hysteric globe— (While whizz'd and rattled, lobe on lobe, With respiration hard her lungs) Thus to the very tongue of tongues (Oh! school her in the school of Molly!) I allude to the tale of “Molly the Scold,” to whom was prescribed a cup of cold water, which, when she found her choler rising, she was to sip till she had sipped it all up. Gave utterance and let off a volley: “Lor! how did I enjoy the joke; “(My sins, you know, I never cloak) “When whirl'd about and tottering, plump “I well nigh flung him on his rump, “Where he was kicking the flag-stones— “No wonder, had I crack'd his bones! “Aye! flung him!

Where is Joan?” At All-fours—a reforming rascal, (Who studied Hoyle, though hot from Pascal) As Alice snivell'd, frown'd or smirk'd, His cards incontinently jerk'd; And his dear person knock'd about, And muttering, made a mighty rout. “The dowager appears to slight us, “And I—a martyr to St. Vitus—” “Pray have you heard the news?” cried Alice, (I fear 'twas with a spice of malice) “This morning—never to come back “Off went the justice!” “High, low, Jack!” He o'er a chess-board bent Where two virginities intent On pawns, nor less on rooks, yet listen'd: Their eyes with indignation glisten'd!

But I denounce not cards altogether: far from it. Much less do I object to music, vocal or instrumental— though neither psalms nor hymns. There are one or two (my opinion of whose good sense would have precluded the suspicion of such Puritanism) who object to a simple, innocent song—as profane. Heaven help them! from the devil's book— Demurest of the tabby kind; One, neither sitting nor reclin'd, The other clad in garb subfusc, Stiff as her steel or whalebone busk, In tracts and trash the arch-arbitress, Quaint in the corner, snug at chess. Cried Edith—“That old drivelling fool, He wrote against the Sunday school, If not against the Bell, I'm sure— Who could such petulance endure? Then rail'd at Methodism, God wot! And penn'd a song against a sot.” “Oh!—I have lost the game!” scream'd Kate, “Sad interruption—No—checkmate!” Thus if they simper, scoff, or smile, They give free current to their bile, Till all, to close the clack confusion, “Come to this sorrowful conclusion— Yet “sorrowful”—without a sigh! Curl'd was the lip with irony; And frolic lit the twinkling eye.— By learning and her sons forsaken, They saw, as my poor frame was shaken, Of disappointment many a token, Announcing that I died heart-broken!— In prose or in poetic fiction, Have I complain'd of dereliction? What human nature was, I ween, Full well I knew, nor nourish'd spleen. I knew (still cheerful and lighthearted) The weak are by the world deserted: I knew that some, however civil, Devoutly wish'd me to the devil. Shy from my glance if Dennis stole, I pitied him with all my soul: His mean evasions to detect I stoop'd not, but walk'd more erect! Believe, or not believe my words, I ne'er had much concern with Lords. In youth, in age, with all my strength, I've ever kept them at arm's length. Yet, while reformers wreak their wrath on The high possessor of Tregothnan, Yet in Boscawen I hail the merit Of ancient worth and patriot spirit; And joy to hear each Cornish anvil Ring for a statue to Dunstanville! Ne'er did I hint I could not brook The strange indifference to Tooke, To whom we owe in quarto—folio— Of taste and science such an olio! I ne'er pronounc'd in phrase judicial Benhaddads knowledge superficial— And tho', when of their lawless imps (Wild ass's colts) I caught a glimpse, And saw of discipline the abuse— All Bedlam seeming to break loose; I to the sex (and oft I've said it) Conceded not a grain of credit, Yet seldom have I sent the ladies, With their brats, “howling down to Hades!” Vain human kind! How few have friends! Who acts, but for his private ends? Look to the living manners—look; Search in your study every book Where wisdom speaks, from shelf to shelf— Your best deeds centre in yourself: The social passion Fancy paints Alike in sinners and in saints, Whilst in the moralist's account Conceal'd from sight, but paramount, Their motives we, alas! resolve, Into that abject thing self-love, Which o'er the bosom gently stealing Too oft absorbs all other feeling, Confess'd by few, but mourn'd by many, In rebus quantum est inane! And I have proved, in prose and metre, This truth—Hoc sola mors fatetur. THE END.</field>
