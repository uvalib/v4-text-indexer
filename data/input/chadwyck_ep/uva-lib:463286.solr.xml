      <field name="fulltext">The Præface of the Aucthor, wherin is declared the contents of these his fiue bookes. Of Musick though the cheef knowlege hath long time hindred been, Becaws vertu not be'ing maintaind, soon ceaseth it is seen, Yet through the good zeal of a few, who therin pleasure took, No costs nor pains, it to preferu of long time they forsook, Beside our princes charge of late to haue it eft renewd, With verte'ous rulers vnder her, whose willingnes is shewd, Like loou of gentils and honest hath raizd it from low eb, Helping Phœbus to pluck from fatall sisters that his web, The which he hath dispozd into the minds, so, of a few As what, they haue late wrought therby, abrode sum part they shew: All which doth now encorage me this wurk to send to light, Onely for those who in singing of Musick do delight. (As likewise do the Dutch, the French, and the Italiens, Who put in Print, most that they write, with their musicall pens) Part of the matters or ditties that I haue set heerto, The Psalter, or Psalms of Dauid, I haue them taken fro. To the rest of this haue I set (the base minds for to pleas) Such Sonets as I think will sum of their sowr dumps appeas, Deuizd vpon common chaunces, and out of worldly wurks, So, as the reason hath me taught, which in my rude hed lurks, Sum of them be Poeticall, sum Philosophicall, On sacred write, I made others to cumfort me withall, In which is toucht th'affects of youth, the like of riper yeers, Also of those that do decline, when cold old age appeers. Since erst I sayd, that heer emong my Sonets ther be sum Poeticall, whose gods I vzd, as then in mind did cum: Heer wold I that all such shuld know, that likes not Poets write, Wherin towching their heathen gods, their fanci'es they endite, That those of them, who Christi'ans ar: know (as the Psalmist sayth) They ar but vain, whose credite like, deserus to haue no fayth. Eke Christi'ans know, that mighty God, the Lord, who rewls our fate, And sends such fortewn as he knows is meet for our estate. For fortewn is none otherwise to vnderstand I know, Then that which pleaseth th'almighty, on vs for to bestow. Of Poetry thus heer I end, my writing take at best, My pen heerafter from such toys, shall alway be at rest. This my sayd Musick made, do I, for voyces thus contriue, To sum for thre, to most for fowr, and t'all the rest for fiue. Of these songs sum be short, sum long, sum hard, sum easi be, And of both sorts between them both, ye shall emong them se, Heerin be diuers songs also, the which altred haue I, By mending of sum the Musick, of others the ditti, So that they be not now, as they were when I first them gaue Out of my hands, abrode to seru their turns who now them haue: Also becaws sum songs heer be, whose trades percha?ce b'vnknown, Not onely to such who in skill of singing ar well grown, But eke to sum Musitians, who songs can well compose, (That name belongs to none others, though sum theron do glose) Eeu'n such with the others (I say) I let them vnderstand, That I, A traueller haue been, in sundry forrein land: Wher I emong the people did, a certaine time abide, Whose diuers trades of Musick, part (although not all) I spide, But cheefly the Italian, emong the which is one, That called is Napolitane (a prety mery one) Beside all those forreiners trades, sum English I haue herd, Their diffrence shall appeer, when they together be conferd, All which when causes moued me, these songs at times to make, Now one trade, and then an other, I did follow and take, (Those trades thus toucht, brings heer to mind, how sundry sorts there be, Through whose selfwils, no harmony can very well agre, Except that which they list to like, or sounds both shrill and sharp, (Such oft with Midas, prays Pans pipe before Apollos harp) And as in the compositi'on of this my Musick made, I ioyn th'english with the stranger t'agre in musicks trade, So I the flats, and sharps do set, as if both sorts heer sing, Can haue no iust caws to mislike, or cauellati'ons bring. But in other obseruances though we sumwhat vary, Yet as I learnd in natiue land, so in this wurk vse I. Also wheras this mark ij. is set, t'is but to put in mind, For to repeat, if that ye list (and not ye therto bind) Part of the word or els sentence, the which before it stands: Now vse these matters as ye list, I make none other bands. Part of my yoong days (late ended) on this I did employ, As thing wherin (for cawses sayd) I had as then sum ioy. If gratefully it be accept, my content meed I haue, Becaws for other benefite, I neither look nor craue. My sayd request, I am assewrd the thankfull will alow, Though diuers others, otherwise, of this, their minds will show. As nothing can be so well ment, that may be sayd or doon, But that the enui'ows to deface the same will frame them soon. So I for my well meaning heer, to haue the like reward, I dowt I shall, haue of all such, whose wits haue no regard For to consider of all things, as they of right shuld do, And to geeu eu'ry vertu that, which doth belong therto. First of these sorts, who I speak of, ar one that barb'rows be, Who though of cre'atures reas'nable, all their fourms shaped be, Yet they so deep infected ar, either with ignoraunce, Grosnes of wit, cruell nature, franzi, or els perchance With sum, or altogether of those diseases in sort As inwardly they neuer felt, or tasted (to be short) The secret wurking of the concordant sounds of Musick, And therfore they with taunting terms, against it spurn and kick. What I cowld write in Musicks prays, I will at this time stay, And let you se what one famows, of that science doth say, I mean the wurthy gentilman, Doctor Haddon by name, Whose learned Muse, for Musicks sake, these verses thus did frame. Musicen primum docuit voluptas, Musices auxit studium voluptas, Musices vsum retinet voluptas, gaudia fundens. Musicen lusit placidus Cupido, Musicen lusit Cytherea mollis, Musicen lusit cithara suaui clarus Apollo. Musice mentes tenuit virorum, Musice sensus tenuit ferarum, Musice montes, &amp; aquas, &amp; ornos Sede remouit. Musice summis dominatur astris, Musice terræ dominatur imæ, Musice ponto dominatur alto, cuncta pererrans. Musice mentis medicina mæstæ, Musice multum minuit malorum, Musice magnis, medijs, minutis maxima mittit. A second sort be Momus mates, who sets their cheef delight In perusing of others wurks, to se wher they be right: What in theim lacks, or what to much, so fine these priers be, As Lynceus was, who (it is sayd) cowld through a stone wall se. But if that no man wold write more, then they abrode do show, We must content vs with that, which, we do already know. A third sort now I must heer towch, a sort of iangling Iays, Whose spightfull pens, to scof and skowld, is prest at all asfays. As Zoylus did to that Poet, who we do Homer call, So wold these Zoylings haue vertew vnto their pens be thrall. Therfore I say to the hole crew of all th'infected wights Momus mates, and Zoylings (foresayd) who be'in such peeuish plights, That easi'er t'is for sum to find fawts written that doth lurk, Then it is for theim, theim t'amend and make perfect a wurk. And easi'er t'is for other sum t'amend fawts that do rise, Then out of their brains by study, for to make or deuise A new wurk so great, and perfect in all points as that is, In which they can amend the fawts, that they do spy amis. To such who as be fawt finders (perchance wher as none be) In that wherin they haue no skill, and yet wold seem to se. I now say as Apelles did the shoomaker vnto, When he beyond the slipper wold haue had Apelles do. Heer to conclude I say that I this wurk do not set owt To greeu any of those foresayd (of whom I may haue dowt) But I do it only therwith, Gods prays ech wher to sing Together with heau'nly solas, to heauy harts to bring. For priuat vse of baser thoughts, not aspyring so hy, Which like to feed their fansies, all, on wurks that be worldly. To recre'at th'ouer burdened, and sore afflicted minds, To cumfort eke the powrs and spreets, which mans helth brings and binds. And so consequently to benefit ech part b'accord, Of those that do delite to liue, alway in trew concord.The following poems are scored for music in the source texts. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. FINIS. The first part of Songes composed by Thomas Whythorne, conteyning Songes for three voyces. [If eu'ry one that goth about] If eu'ry one that goth about, to set abroad for common vew, a work, hath any fear or dout, that the faut finding carping crew, should vtterly the same deface, few works set forth then should we haue: but who by vertue doth purchase, their state aye lastes lye they in graue, their state aye lastes lye they in graue. Tho. VVhythorne. [As many heads haue many wits] As many heads haue many wits, so diuers men of vertues haue, and vertue likes her ritches so, as other goods she doth not craue: nor to be celebrate of those, which be but of the c?mon sort, because that of her selfe she hath, no need of prayse or good report. Tho. VVhyt. [When fliering fortune fauoreth] When fliering fortune fauoreth, the fals world then smileth, but turn she once about her wheel, strange changes shalt thou feel. Wherfore as now I co?sell thee, vse truth and honestie: so shalt thou stand &amp; neuer quail, though fortune do thee fail, though fortune do thee fail. T. VV. [When Cupid had compelled me] When Cupid had compelled me, to serue my fained frend, Pallas from that perswaded me, lest trouble I should finde: for though thy loue doth seem, quoth she, thy good will to requite, yet in the end thou shalt well see, thy gwerdon shall thee spite, yet in the end thou shalt well see, thy gwerdon shall thee spite. Tho. VVhythorne. [Such as in loue would haue long ioy] Such as in loue would haue long ioy, their choice must be for vertues sake, if otherwise they seek to knit, no deep root shall their true loue take. Tho. VVhythorne. [The restles race] The restles race, the yong man runs, is strange to know in ech degre, now heapes he ioyes, and cares he shuns, anon his myrth away doth fle. T. VV. [Though frends be frail] Though frends be frail, in eu'ry place, and promise broke that erst was plight: Yet one there is aboue all frends, who faileth not the faithfull wight. Thomas VVhythorne. [In frends of ech estate] In frends of ech estate, look for equalitie to be alway, of minde, of welth, and honours eke, els soon they swarue and part away. Tho. VVhyt. [Who y? for truth decrees] Who y? for truth decrees (as iudge most sage) true noblenes of right onely to st?d, in dignitie, or auncient linage, or great ritches, or reuenues of land, if therwithall he do not link in band, wisedome, knowledge, and other vertues rare, his iudgement then of reason is but bare, his iudgement then of reason is but bare. Tho. VVhythorne. [Thou shalt soon see] Thou shalt soon see, in ech estate, wher that do take deep root these fautes, suspitiousnes beyond y? rate, that needful is, or like assauts, of hasty mind, or gelous mood, gret sorows ay to be their food. T. VV. [The happy life as I do take] The happy life as I do take, the quiet mind therof is ground, which sowre sorowes doth still forsake, digesting them as they abound: for who fr? cares will passe to ease, must take all troubles in good part, and if the mind take no disease all troubles els will soon reuert. Thomas VVhythorne. [He that conteinneth iniuries] He that conteinneth iniuries, his state better appeare shall soon, then his who frets maliciously, till he reuenge offences done: for as malice tormentes his hart, and all his helth doth straight vnwrest, the other not forcing therof, returneth soon to quiet rest, returneth soon to quiet rest. Tho. VVhythorne. [Beware how sorowes thee oppres] Beware how sorowes thee oppres, let wisedome rule thy fantasie, so as dispaire thee not posses, with deadly dread thy fayth to try. Tho. VVhythorne. [What euer hath been in time past] What euer hath been in time past, in time present t'is often found, y? flattery hath got y? cast, to get frendship both safe &amp; sound, wheras plaines in word &amp; deed, of hatred great is sure to speed. T. VV. The end of the first part. The second part of Songes, composed by Thomas Whythorne, conteining Songes for fower voyces. [For to reclaim to frend a froward foe] For to reclaim to frend a froward foe, or bring to passe affaires waighty &amp; great, if patience cheefly doth work it so, as vertue rare it may be thronde in seate: for such in whom that thing is so to finde, though thicke be sown, yet most spring out of kinde, for such in whom that thing is so to finde, though thicke be sown, yet most spring out of kinde. Tho. VVhythorne. [The giftes of nature well disposde] The giftes of nature well disposde, are pleasant to the sight, the like of fortune rule the rost, be it in wrong or right: though both or none of these be had, yet to y? giftes of minde, the wise haue the prerogatiue, in all ages assinde, the wise haue the prerogatiue, in all ages assinde. Tho. VVhyt. [Though choler cleapt y? hart about] Though choler cleapt y? hart about, &amp; set it all on fire, which causde the to?g in hasty wise, to blast out for my hire, a dreadfull change for me to haue, if it had taken place: yet now y? storme is gone &amp; past, and I in quiet case, yet now the storme is gone &amp; past, and I in quiet case. Thomas VVhythorne. [Now that the truth is tride] Now that the truth is tride, of things that be late past, I see when all is spide, that words are but a blast: and promise great, is but a heat, if not performde at last, and promise great, is but a heat, if not performde at last. Thomas VVhythorne. [Where prayses great be geu'n] Where prayses great be geu'n, or fautes likewise be found, oft times they both are blown abrode, by will, without good ground. Ech thing is not as seems, and as selfe wils likes it, to prayse or blame, for such most times do rather misse then hit. Tho. VVhyt. [To ouercome by patience] To ouercome by patience, wher wrongs hath been of fr?d, or to be stayd therwith fr? will that would be reuenged, to finde out such in this sayd sort, possest with this vertue, is hard to do, so as y? same, is hard to do, so as the same haue alway perfect shew. T. VV. [Take heed of words thou mayst not vouch] Take heed of words thou mayst not vouch, not spoke, for them th'art free alway, fr? word and deed, but sayd, they do thee rule and touch thy sure estate, wherfore I say, of words take heed. Tho. VVhythorne. [Like as the smoke outwardly seen] Like as the smoke outwardly seen, doth geue knowlege wher that fire is: so euill words discouers plain, the hatefull hart wher that ire is, so euill words discouers plain, the hatefull hart where that ire is. Thomas VVhythorne. [To reprehend or mock] To reprehend or mock, therof the common end, is c?mon, and great hate to them that vse the same: to flout none hath the leaue, but to some to repr'hend, authoritie geues leaue, th'offender for to blame. Thomas VVhythorne. [It is a world some sots to see] It is a world some sots to see, who measure honestie by welth, accounting all honest to be, as they posses of worldly pelth: and Lazarus with God did rest, when the rich gulch to hell was prest, to hell was prest. Thomas VVhythorne. [I can not deem them happy sure] I can not deem them happy sure, who can but onely crake of mucke, I meane ritches which worldlings lure, from heau'nly cares them selu's to pluck: but if vertue to welth ioynd be, twise happy then they be I see. Tho. VVhyt. [All ye that serue y? blind God loue] All ye that serue y? blind God loue, shall in y? end your labour loose, he is a fool &amp; wil not moue, but where he lighteth there to choose, and how should he geue due reward, who therto neuer had regard. Perchance his shaftes may pearce your mind, to make ye blind to serue your foe: thus when the blind doth lead the blind, ye know what good therof doth grow, therfore take heed how you do proue, to loose your ioye by band of loue, to loose your ioy by band of loue. Tho. VVhythorne. [It doth me good wh? Zephrus rains] It doth me good wh? Zephrus rains, in Dians walke for to disport, wher dulcet ayres such ioy me gains, as spot of care doth not resort, the birdes with gladsom tunes remains, ech thing Apollo doth comfort, but I of all do most embrace: wherfore my song is and shall be, of ioyfulnes and of solace, so oft as I this time may see. Thomas VVhythorne. [Prefer not great beuatie before vertue] Prefer not great beuatie before vertue, the much gazing theron many may rue. For to beholde the beautie rare, of some who therwith possest are: but them t'accompany and oft to touch, is perilous this proof doth firmly vouch. Tho. VVhythorne. [It hath been proued both euen and morow] It hath been proued both euen and morow, y? a little mirth is worth much sorow. Many that haue toyled &amp; wrought in vaine, &amp; that ech part of ease did little take, yet in the end for to quench all their paine, they did th? rest &amp; sport, and good cheer make, they did them rest and sport, and good cheer make. It hath been proued both euen, &amp;c. Tho. VVhythorne. [I haue ere this time heard many one say] I haue ere this time heard many one say, take time while time is, for time will away. Who so that great affaires haue to be done, let no deferrings of time be vsed, lest they be far off wh? they would be sped. I haue ere this time, &amp;c. Tho. VVhyt. [Though crooked cares do chance] Though crooked cares do chance, to wretched wilfull wils, which vnwisely aduance, the reach of many ills: to those thus may we glaunce, where wilfull will planteth, wit with wisedome wanteth, wisedome wanteth. Thomas VVhythorne. [When that well tipled are] When that well tipled are, with boused bum, dan Bacchus birdes so deare, their tounges then talk, and blab at large, that which in mind doth come, not shame c? let their retchles speech to walk: beside all this most times such factes they vse, as oft their frends their companies refuse. Thomas VVhythorne. [Who y? will wey of ages all] Who y? will wey of ages all, their change of shapes fr? time to time, what childish thoughts to younglings fall, as yeres waxe ripe how they do clime, may wel in mind this sentence call: as time doth alter eu'ry wight, so eu'ry age hath his delight, so eu'ry age hath his delight. Thomas VVhythorne. [When fortune seemd so much my frend] When fortune seemd so much my frend, to place me with assured stay, then with a becke she made me bow, vnto my foe to be his pray, then with a becke she made me bow, vnto my foe to be his pray. Tho. VVhythorne. [If I had not foreseen] If I had not foreseen, the changes newly hapt, the sodeine chance therof in cares would haue me wrapt: therfore I do protest, foreknowlege is the best, of troubles that must come, for then they soon digest, therfore I do protest, foreknowlege is the best, of troubles that must come, for then they soon digest. Thomas VVhythorne. [Of natures giftes wit is y? cheef] Of natures giftes wit is y? cheef, which doth discern both good and ill, &amp; both wit works for to be breef, as reason rules or wilfull will: Let reason therfore rule wit still, lest will in wit doth work his will, doth work his will. T. VV. [Who so that list] Who so that list, his chaunce to try, on fortunes fickle wheel, he shal soon see &amp; also spye, her pleasures strange to feel: For as soon as she hath him set, aloft on that her stage, fr? high to low she will him set, and all his pompe asswage, fr? high to low she will him set, and all his pomp asswage. Tho. VVhythorne. [Though fortune frowne on me alway] Though fortune frowne on me alway, turning my ioye to pensiuenes, yet do I still hope for the day, that all my wo shall haue redres: And no mishap shall take the place, to bring me in this wofull case. For all my hope is in my God, whose look dame fortune dare not bide, his force and hers is so far odde, from where he is she will soon slide: And why should I pray for her ayde, since on her wheel she hath few stayde? Thomas VVhythorne. [Ponder the proof so far as thou] Ponder the proof so far as thou, in worldly works be proued shall, how vaine they are in deed and show, how dangerous to deal withall: and nothing els y? shalt then find, this world (thus working in his kind) but wide scaffold for vs ech one, to play our tragedies vpon, but wide scaffold for ech one, to play our tragedies vpon. Tho. VVhyt. [The doutfull state that I posses] The doutfull state that I posses, doth trouble all my wits throughout, one while good hap seems t'will not ceasse, then by and by it makes me dout: And thus standing in hope and dread, I wish oft times that I were dead, I wish oft times that I were dead. Tho. VVhythorne. [Is there no choice for me] Is there no choice for me, but still to tast this strife? shall all misease and pensiue thought, torment me all my life? O Lord to thee I call, now let thy pleasure be, to keep me from this misery, in ioye with thine to be, to keep me from this misery, in ioye with thine to be. Tho. VVhythorne. [The diuers chance that God doth send] The diuers chance that God doth send, to vexe the mind and body both, it doth proceed as we offend, or as his loue towards vs groth: Somtimes for that, our sinnes encrease,somtimes to try our constantnes: But I for sinne must craue release, which neuer ceasse me to oppres. Thomas VVhythorne. [The great offence of my most sinfull ghost] The great offence of my most sinfull ghost, with terror great doth ouerflow the same, and that which now my sprite oppresseth most, is remembrance of life past out of frame. Wh? I for grace lift vp my daseld eye, vnto the throne fr? whence it doth descend, euen then dispaire seems to approch me nye, to make my hope in me for to take end. But loe, dame fayth bids me leaue slipper hold, and take sure gripe on promise made of yore, by him whose eyes disdains not to behold, the h?ble cheer, with hart tormented sore. So that mercy, for mercy I do cry, vnto y? Lord, fr? wh? springs all mercy, so that mercy, for mercy I do cry, vnto the Lord, from whom springs all mercy. Tho. VVhythorne. [O good Lord haue mercy on me] O good Lord haue mercy on me according to thy great mercy, &amp; do away th'iniquitie y? I haue wrought most wickedly, y? I haue wrought most wickedly. T. VV. [I will yeld thankes to thee] I will yeld thankes to thee, O Lord in Trinitie, because thou hast heard me, my prayer all: and in my turmentre, my hope in thee shall be, to turne mine enemie, when I thee call, to turne mine enemie, when I thee call. Tho. VVhythorne. [My soule and all that in me is] My soule and all that in me is, to prayse my God alway, shall ready be to do the same, in the best sort I may. For he to me hath shewde his grace, vnworthy though I be, therfore will I set forth his prayse, to all of ech degree, therfore will I set forth his prayse, to all of ech degree. Tho. VVhyt. [Since I embrace y? heau'nly grace] Since I embrace y? heau'nly grace, in sort as I would haue, reioyce I must, till I for dust, do yeld my corps to graue. Was neuer none, did sigh &amp; mone, I thinke more oft then I, for deep dispaire, me did empaire, confo?ding me well nye, But then Gods grace, appeard in place, putting back that foule feend: and sayd to me, of comfort be, for heau'n is thine at end. Wherfore reioyce, both sound &amp; voyce, let no tune mourning be, but with delight, with all your might, reioyce ye all with me. Tho. VVhythorne. [When I remember of this world] When I remember of this world, what I therein do know, how all the pleasures of the same, but vaine in th'end do grow. O Lord say I happy they be, who y? doost entertain, for they shal euerlastingly, in perfect ioyes remaine: O Lord say I happy they be, who thou doost entertaine, for they shall euerlastingly, in perfect ioyes remaine. Thomas VVhythorne. Grace before meate. [O Lord aboue send vs thy grace to be our stay] O Lord aboue send vs thy grace to be our stay, so as we neuer do that which belongs vnto the sinfull wicked way, the sinfull wicked way. Thomas VVhythorne. [Almightie God thy louing care] Almightie God thy louing care, is to prouide for vs alway, &amp; heer hast sent for our welfare, such worldly food as feed we may. So we thee pray to send also, our soules to feed thy food diuine, that thy glory in vs may show, to eu'ry wight. So y? infine, so y? infine, wh? they by grace see our c?fort, may for y? like to thee resort: and so to laud thy holy name, as all we heer do now the same. The first Grace. Grace after meate. [O our father we yeld to thee] O our father we yeld to thee, for all thy gifts most thankfull prayse, which by vs now receaued be, or heertofore by any wayes. Desiring thee y? thou wilt saue, thy Church, our Queen, &amp; all her land, and send vs all y? peace to haue, the which in Iesus Christ doth stand. Gra?t this O Lord to geue to vs, for thy sonnes sake our Lord Iesus, to wh? with thee and th'holy sprite, be all glory for aye, so be it. T. VV. Psalme. 95. O come let vs sing vnto the Lord: let vs hartily reioyce in the strength of our saluation. Let vs come before his presence with thanks geuing: and shew our selues glad in him with Psalms. For the Lord is a great God: and a great king aboue all Gods. In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the str?gth of the hils is his also. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land. O come let vs worship &amp; fall down: and kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, &amp; the sheep of his hands. Today if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hartes: when your fathers tempted me: prouoked me, &amp; saw my works. Fortie yeares long was I greeued with this generation, and sayd: it is a people that do erre in their harts, for they haue not knowne my wayes. Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest. Glory be to the father, and so y? sonne, and to the holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and euer shall be, world without end, Amen, world without end, Amen. Thomas VVhythorne. Psalme. 100. O be ioyfull in the Lord all ye landes: serue the Lord with gladnes, and come before his presence with a song. Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made vs, &amp; not we ourselues: we are his people, &amp; the sheep of his pasture, O go your way into his gates with thanks geuing, and into his courts with praise: be thankfull vnto him, &amp; speake good of his name. For the Lord is gratious, his mercy is euerlasting: and his truth endureth fr? generation to generation. Glory be to the father, and to the sonne, and to the holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, &amp; euer shall be, world without end, so be it. Tho. VVhythorne. Psalme. 123. Vnto thee lift I vp mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heau'ns, Behold, euen as y? eyes of seruantes, look vnto the hand of their masters, and as y? eyes of a maiden, vnto y? hand of her mistres: euen so our eyes wait vpon y? Lord our God, vntill he haue mercy vpon vs. Haue mercy vpon vs, O Lord, for we are vtterly despised. Our soule is filled, with y? scornful reproof of y? welthy: and with y? despitefulnes of y? proud. Glory be to y? father, &amp; to the sonne, and to the holy Ghost. As it was in y? beginning, as it is now, &amp; euer shal be, world w?out end. Sobeit. Psalme. 134. Behold, now prayse y? Lord, all ye seruantes of the Lord, Ye that by night stand in y? house of the Lord: euen in y? courts of the house of our God. Lift vp your hands in y? sanctuary: and praise the Lord. The Lord y? made heau'n &amp; earth, geue thee blessing out of Sion. Glory be to y? father, and to the sonne, &amp; to the holy Ghost As it was in the beginning, is now, &amp; euer shall be, world w?out end, so be it, so be it. T. VV. Psalme. 130. Out of y? deep haue I called vnto thee O Lord: Lord heare my voyce, O let thine eares consider well y? voyce of my c?plaint. If thou Lord wilt be extreme to mark what is done amisse, O Lord who may abide it? For there is mercy with thee, therfore shalt y? be feared. I look for y? Lord, my soule doth wait for him: in his word is my trust. My soule flyeth vnto y? Lord, before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch. O Israell, trust in y? Lord for with y? Lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israell, fr? all his sinnes. Glory be to the father, and to the sonne, &amp; to the holy Ghost. At it was in y? beginning, as it is now, &amp; euer shal be, world without end. Sobeit. Sobeit. Sobeit. Thomas VVhythorne. The end of the second part. The third part of Songes, composed by Thomas Whythorne, conteining Songes for fiue voyces. [When wit doth seek vice to embrace] When wit doth seek vice to embrace, then wit him selfe doth much deface: for wit and wisedome diffreth so, as wit from wisedome needes must go. If wit by wisedome rule in place, as reason would it should be so, then wit so working, ye shall see, will worke all well in ech degree. But if wit worke without wisedome, I dout what good therof will come, but if wit worke without wisedome, I dout what good therof will come. Tho. VVhythorne. [The musicke tunes of voyce or sound] The musicke tunes of voyce or sound, doth helpe the eares, and doth expell, all sorowes that y? hart doth wound, also y? wits it cherisheth well: it soupleth sinewes of ech wight, and eke the faint it fils with might, it fils with might. Tho. VVhythorne. [As t'is a signe of persons graue] As t'is a signe of persons graue, patiently to beare th'unkinde parts, vsed to th? by such as haue, by frendly proof known their true harts: so is a signe a fool to know, vnthankfulnes, wher it doth show, so is a signe a fool to know, vnthankfulnes wher it doth show. T. VV. [Of a hard beginning, of a hard beginning comes] Of a hard beginning, comes a good end many say: which prouerb old a comfort is to some where cares bears sway. If good beginning chaunce, shall we then dout a change? Not so, for then the faithles will, from goodnes soon estrange. Of a hard beginning comes a good end many say. Thomas VVhythorne. [The pleasant and the gentle speech] The pleasant and the gentle speech, where countnaunce like doth show, court'ous behauour and gesture, where maners milde do grow. Of all things in absence to make the best with good report, doth winne and keep faythfull frendship, where reason doth resort, doth winne and keep faithfull frendship, where reason doth resort. Tho. VVhythorne. [The haughtines of some but base] The haughtines of some but base, whose outward show seems of some port, takes on them as they were in case, for to countnaunce the higher sort: these would haue all to th? be bound, and they from all free to be found, these would haue all to them be bound, and they from all free to be found. Thomas VVhythorne. [I haue not onely read] I haue not onely read, but eke by proof haue tride, how such who daily haunt their greaters company, can not shun great offence on th'one or th'other side, wherfore happy are they, who such an ill can flye. Thomas VVhythorne. [Nothing is sharper then low thinges] Nothing is sharper then low thinges, when they by groth on hye be brought: so none in pride, and crueltie, are like to some who rise of nought, so none in pride, and crueltie, are like to some who rise of nought, who rise of nought. Tho. VVhythorne. [In weale &amp; wo be patient] In weale &amp; wo be patient, let not fury thy hart posses, for she alway y? same doth rent, and brings it oft in great distres, wherfore if thou wilt liue in rest, in no wise harbor such a gest, wherfore if y? wilt liue in rest, in no wise harbour such a gest. Tho. VVhythorne. [As thy shadow it selfe applyeth] As thy shadow it selfe applyeth, to follow thee wher so thou go, &amp; when thou bends it self it wryeth, turning as thou both to &amp; fro: the flatterer doth euen so, and shopes himself the same to glose, with many a fawning &amp; gay show, whom he would frame for his purpose, with many a fawning and gay show, whom he would frame for his purpose. Thomas VVhythorne. [It doth belong more of good right] It doth belong more of good right, to such as haue courage gentle, to shew forth plain to eu'ry wight, the loue or hate they bear them till: then slily to cloke, or closely to hide, by their dissembling look and cheer, the good or ill that in their harts doth bide, wherby their wyles cannot appeare, wherby their wyles cannot appeare. Thomas VVhythorne. [Who that to quaffing is bent] Who that to quaffing is bent, and to drink the rate, that dame nature (the nursse of helth) hath th? forbod, the mastry of th?selues they loose, their strength doth so abate, beside their worse reward, which is the wrath of God, beside their worse reward, which is the wrath of God. Tho. VVhythorne. [If flattered be y? wicked] If flattered be y? wicked, fr? ill to worse become they than, wh? malice is likewise praised, the harme therof few suffer can, the harme therof few suffer can, few suffer can, few suffer can. Thomas VVhythorne. [If thou y? hast a trusty frend] If thou y? hast a trusty frend, desire that his loue may not swarue, then how to vse him to that end, thou shalt now know thy turne to serue. Both gentlenes and curtesie, to him to vse see that thou do. Let no rough speech his patience try: nor crooked maners see thou show. Forbeare him when he is angry. In his errour gently reproue. When aduers chaunce doth touch him nye, comfort him then as doth behoue. So mayst thou not onely retaine, thy frend so long as life doth last: but double loue thou oughtst to gain, as gwerdon for thy frendship past. But wh? thou hast so put in vre, the things that erst I told thee on: if all that please him not, be sure, he is no frend to trust vpon, no frend to trust vpon. Tho. Whythorne. [Thy secretes told to such as haue] Thy secretes told to such as haue, of dissembling the proper way, to be blabd forth thee to be praue, look thou therfore there is no nay. And to the Foxe the Lamb shal gain, ere he of guile findes cause to feare, therfore y? faithfull hart retaine, that holds thy hart and secrets deare, therfore the faythfull hart retaine, that holds thy hart &amp; secrets deare. T. VV. [By new broom] By new broom, ye may be sure, store is good, for they will not long endure. The new broom sweepeth cleane, a prouerb old, that applyed is to such as heerafter shall be told. The double diligent the seruant new: And the hote soner that dy'eth at first vew. The hote loue is soon colde, as oft is seen, and the temp'rate fire doth make the sweetst malt, as wise do ween. The frend at first that seems he will not change, inconstant, yet to prone, it is not strange. Thus my song for to end, in plain words few, t'is not good to trust these three ouer much at the first shew. Tho. VVhyt. [Geue not thy minde to heauines] Geue not thy minde to heauines, suffer not cares to make thee thrall, for they in time dry vp doutles, thy bones and moysture radicall. The ioy and cheerfulnes of hart, is onely comfort of mans life, and gladnes eke prolongs by art, his liuing dayes deuoyde of strife. Now leaue y? sowre and take the sweet, thou shalt for helth finde it most meet, now leaue the sowre and take the sweet, thou shalt for helth finde it most meet. Tho. VVhythorne. [Shall I this wo sustaine] Shall I this wo sustaine, which is come by mischance? and haue no ease againe, but still to haue greuance? Then patience the salue must be, wherwith to heale this sore, till that my God shall send to me, a remedy therfore, till that my God shall send to me, a remedy therefore. Thomas Whythorne. [Till time had taught me for to iudge of late] Till time had taught me for to iudge of late, I did not know the sure and quiet state: At first I thought the simplest life did best, but seing that made a thrall vnto the rest, I changed mind to iudge the best of powre, on whom knowing that high disdaine did lowre, I turned my sentence, and then decreed, the meane (with mind content) the best, whose seed yeldes rather sweet then sowre, the meane (with mind content) the best, whose seed yeldes rather sweet then sowre. Tho. VVhythorne. [As restles head doth always geue] As restles head doth always geue, the like sowre sauce to minde and sprites, so do they all at once reuiue: and irksome dulnes fr? th? fleets, when as the head to passe hath brought, that which he would so faine haue wrought, so faine, so faine haue wrought.
