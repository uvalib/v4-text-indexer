      <field name="fulltext">Soli Deo omnis Gloria. Almighty, Good, Great, Merciful, and Iust, The Angel's Joy; of Men the Hope and Trust: Heaven is thy Throne, thou spans it with thine hand, Non-entities obey at thy Command. Earth's thy Foot-stool, thou view's it with thine eye, Yet both are narrow, for thy Majesty. All that we have, we owe it unto thee; Both Life, and Breath, and our Existencie. Thou (when we were o'r-guilt with Adam's stain) Turn'd QEANQRW=POS, to restore's again, And by thy Powr and Spirit did us call, To guid our Feet, from such another fall. Thou'rt only good; and he that loves not thee Is Satan's Slave, and not as yet set free From strength of Sin, which thou alone most high, Didst overcome, gave us the Victory. Let Angels praise, and Men adore thy Name, And let all beings bow, and pay the same. Omniscience and Omnipotence are thine; And thy Ubiquity admits no line. Then let thy Kingdome turn to Monarchy, And it's Duration be Eternity. That Sin and Death, may us no more destroy, Then when Stars sung, and thy Sons shouted joy. To the Memory of KING CHARLES the First. Bless'd Saint, Great King, and constant Martyr, I Pay my small Mite here, to thy Memory. Yet these three Nations cannot all pay home, The Summe that's due, Engraven on thy Tomb. Yet hope thy Blood, ah Blood! (was guiltless shed) No Vengeance cryes, but our Sin pardoned. Impute it not for boldness then, that I Could wish thy Life to live, thy Death to die. POEMS On several Occasions. Eternity. What is Eternity? A thing That's round in fashion, like a Ring, It is a NOW, that endeth never. It is a LINE, that lasteth ever. 'Tis semper Idem still the same. An Abstract, only known by name. A Point that cannot be decided; Substracted, Added, nor Divided. It is a round, long, endless Sphere, And sister-twins with Every-where. 'Tis Non ens, clad in something's dress, It laughs the Arts, and Sciences, None can this clew of threed untwine, Or it In terminis define. 'Tis absent still, yet In Præsentia. No Genus, but all Differentia. I trac'd it (by a Demonstration) 'Twixt Vacuum, and Penitration, And though I did exactly mind it, I lost my self, but could not find it. I did conclude it once to call A Forme, though not substantial: But when I laid it to mine Eye, It was a meer Absurdity. I clad it with supposed Fictions, And run my self in Contradictions: For when my Phancie made a stand, Thinking to catch it in my Hand; I cast mine Eye, but could not see Such Fruit, upon Porphyreu's Tree. I can perceive some twi-light sky, Of all our new Philosophy: But this the Object of Objection, Know not by first, nor last conception: Only I think I hear it cry, I'm Endless, Long, Eternity. Some Philosophs it sue, and chase, To know it's height, and see it's face. But it no Parley, but Defie Sounds unto such ????????. 'Tis still at Hand, and yet it flyes Beyond the Horizon of Eyes. I bent my Soul, and shot my Wit, Thinking this Center-Mark to hit; But it (like Arrows, shot in vain) As Immanent turn'd back again. I seriously did once design, It to describe, but not define; Yet got no further but to IT, Which of no limits doth admit; Of no Non ultra, or Non plus, No Prius, nor Posterius. It Time survives, and yet I'm told, It self was ne'er a Minute old. It is a VERB, that doth commence No further, then the present Tense, A NOUN abounding, yet doth fall Objected, to no sense at all. A PRONOUN sure, it needs must be, For it includes Him, Thee, and Me, A PARTICIPLE, that gives and takes, Yet Less, or More it never makes. And for an ADVERB it may pass, Because it is an endless Cras. A PREPOSITION, out of doubt, For Circacircum's round about. 'Tis a Conjunction that doth draw Forth endless long et cætera. It needs must be an INTERJECTION, Branched forth in Passion, and Perfection, Because it hath, still to throw in Evax, and Heu, and e'r begin. The moment of our short time is, ETERNITY'S Parenthisis. Yet the Duration that's called time, In it's own proper sense and clime, Is all one with Eternity: But 'cause all Mortals here must dye, We change the Name, but not the Nature; Terming our measure like the Creature. It, none that lives but one doth know, And can make it our Friend, or Foe. Whom we alone can fully call Heter, and Homogeniall. A Parte ante, and a Post, Whom chance, or change doth not accost, Who did us save, when we were lost. By whom, let Reader Thee, and Me, And all true hearted Christians be Bless'd, unto all ETERNITIE. THE WORLD'S Unworthiness. John 1. 17. The Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ. Moses a Shephard, and the Man of God, Feeding his Flocks, in Horeb Mount abode: And as he sought some wandering Sheep to spy, A Non-such Object did surprise his eye. A Bush, (which is Hyperbole to say) Did burn a-pace, but not consume away. Therefore amaz'd, he thither made his flight, To see that strange, and unexpected sight. But 'ere he knew, he forc'd was to retire; For him whose Name is A Consuming Fire, The King of Kings from Heaven to Earth was come, To give the Law, Per postliminium. The Great Jehovah Lord, descended had, To do the work, th' Almighty promised. But neither Plagues, nor Wrath, nor any Act, Or Miracle of Mercy, could bring back The chosen Israel, to pay the score In workes, his great Grandfather run before. The heavenly Herauld both in smoak, &amp; fire, To pay their debt, all Mortals did require. God's Majesty, made Earth's Foundations shake: Mount Sinai tremble, and the people quake. A fiery Law went out, made Jacob mourn, It gave a light; but every spark did burn, No deb't was paid, for Moses could no more But quake, and tremble, further on the score. And all the World could only but confess, God's holiness, and their Unrighteousness. Therefore the Lord (to keep us free from harm) Lay'd up the Bond, and gave a longer term. God only good (as our case did require) Turn'd flame of love, from a consuming fire. And likewise veil'd (his great love to express) The burning Bush, within a Humaine dress. Which Mortals boldly might approach unto, Which not the meekest man before durst do. THE WORLD'S Ingratitude. John 1. 10. He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the world knew him not. O Thankless Globe! of thrice adulterate clay, Whose Sin, and Ignorance eclips'd that day, Wherein thy Maker (Mask'd with Mortal dress,) Vail'd his bright light, in humaine lowliness. To reconcile, and ransome thee again, From endless Death, from Sorrow, Grief, &amp; Pain. He left his Fathers Court, to visit thee, And Flesh became, to set thee Prison-free. The King of Kings, the Lord of all things, he Came in a Servants form, to suit for thee. Power, Wisdom, Goodness, Beauty, Life &amp; Love With light, did all discend from heaven above, To reunite, espouse, and bring again The wretched world, from the old Serpents bane. When Adam's race was dead, and sunk in sin, Whom none could bring to life, nor once begin A Remedy, sufficient to heal Poor Apostates, nor could find any bail In Heaven, or Earth, who worthy was and just, To whom the God of truth could give in trust His Power, and Sp'rit, to fight, &amp; put to chase The Host of Hell, and world of Wickedness. When neither Man nor Angel this durst dare, The God of peace became a Man of War. He made the world: but when he came therein, To purifie, and make it clean from sin, They turned him out of doors, and did deny Him Bed, or Pillow, whereupon to lye: They would not give him lodging, one poor Night; Though unto him belong'd the whole World's right. Both Beasts, &amp; Fowls, had whereupon to rest; The Fox had holes, the Sparrow had a nest: And yet the Son here was so humble made, He had not whereupon to lay his Head. O Great Ingratitude! he did lay by His Royal Robes, and Glorious Majesty; And took our Nature, that he might restore Us to the Righteousness, we lost before: But when he came unto his dearest own; He (like a stranger) was to them unknown. They took his Life, and they by him did live, He (by his Death) Life unto them did give. They Murthered him: But he Reviv'd agen; And his delight is with the Sons of Men. Here's a Misterious Love, and no Man knows it; But he, to whom the Father of Spirits showes it. The Stedfast-Christian Eccles. 4. 12. A threefold Cord is not easily broken. Luke 24. 32. Did not our Heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, &amp;c. Faith, Hope, and Love, Are from above, And he that keeps them sure, Can never Fall, For Good and all, Whil'st Life-time doth endure. Though Tempests blow, Through Stormes of Snow, Be of a stedfast mind, Ther's none needs care For Prince of Air, Whil'st God rides on the Wind. He can no more, But only roar, And sue us, for his prey: But ten dayes space Will turn the chase, And he will shrink away. Suspirium Regale: OR A Royal Sigh of King CHARLES the First, On His Arreignment. Eccle. 8. 4. Where the Word of a King is there is Power, and who may say unto him what dost thou? Chap. 10. Vers. 20. Curse not the King, no not in thy Thought, &amp;c. Job. 34. 18. Is it fit to say to a King, thou art Wicked? and to Princes, ye are Ungodly? Betray'd by Tumults, to a Bloody War! And now Arreign'd at black Rebellion's Ear! Where Lawless Law-pretending Traytors plead, Religiously, both for my Crown, and Head. Yet they to me the Priviledge deny, To speak one Word, my self to justify. Is England's King become a home-born Slave? Both Life, and Liberty, to Beg, and Crave From those Blood-sucking Rebels, who proceeds From open Traytors, unto Regicides. Is this the fate of Kings? what then must be The just revenge of those who murther me? If Reason, Law, Religion, this allow To me their King, what dare injustice do To these few Loyal Subjects, who have stood With me in Tumults, to the Knees in Blood. Unhappy Nation thrice! that dost not know This Visitation day, and dismal blow. Yet in my rigid Fate, I'll Kiss the Rod; Submitting all (in Patience) to my God, Without who's Providence, there is not found A Lark, or Sparrow, falling to the ground. Then (since all beings bow at thy Command) Take Head, and Heart, and Crown, into thine Hand. Since thou my Friends removed hast from me, My Counsellor, Lord, and my Safe-guard be. If thou thy Power, and Presence me bequeath; I shall be more than Conqueror in death. Though Faith be flown, and Truth hath taken wings; Let me prove Faithful, to the KING of KINGS. A Reflection, on the Arreignment OF King Charles the First. Here lyes Treason in a Trap, Rebellion did commit a rape On Loyalty, and Traytours bring The Brat of Treason, to the King: To Father the Hop-gobling Elf, Of Treachery, against Himself. Then Sophister you plainly lie, Quæ malum cannot appeti; But it is true (as it is said) A Crown is of a Cob-web made. In memoriam Caroli primi docollati, Regis Magnæ Brittanniæ, Franciæ, et Hiberniæ, &amp;c. Englished thus, When Charles did fall, And brake us all, Struck through with fatal Sorrow; He said, I see, That I shall be, A Star, in Heaven to morrow. An Elegy, On the Murther and Martyrdome of CHARLES the First: King of Great Brittain, &amp;c. 'Tis said late times, and Ages could but bring Two names of good Kings graven in a Ring. But CHARLES the Great, and Good, augments them three, And leaves the World, a new TRIUMVIRI. A Black Swan sure: a KING! that did excel All Learned Subjects: under him did dwell In his Dominions; what could be the cause? 'Gainst Wisdom, Knowledge, Reason, Natur's Laws; Great Brittain slew it self, and Murthered It's greatest Honour, and cut off it's Head. Religion kill'd the CHURCH; and LAW did fall; And LOYALTY did tax the Crown for all. Great Brittain's Blush, rigidity of Fate! Revenge, without the meanest cause of hate! A Pious King, and Master of such Reason! And Murthered Martyr, guilty of High Treason! 'Gainst whom? I cannot tell; in Love, or Hate, Nor no Man else, but say it was his Fate. What Contradictions, and Enigmaes lye Within the Riddle of this Cruelty! But by past Ages, tell me if ye saw KINGS clear'd by Justice, and condemn'd by Law. What Law? Rebellion only, that dare bring Objections in, against a Lawful KING. But ther's no need (in such Self-murdering Treason) To knock down Contradictions, by sound Reason. On the same. [Here lyes Ashes pure, and just] Here lyes Ashes pure, and just, More pretious than the Guiny-dust: Our CHARLES, that was both Good, and Great, Whom Envy murder'd in despite; Cause his Perfections did appeal The World, to show his Parallel. The cruel Draco, ne'r did bring A Law, to Murther any KING. But here's a Madness, made of Must, Which Rebels only own as Just. In Brittain Great he once did Reign Both King, and States-Man, and Divine. But here his great Crime only stood; He was o'rballenc'd, with too good. But dying Martyr, now we see Non ultra in Humanitie. Then Traytour tell me if you can, (Though two parts Pruit, and third part Man:) Was ever such a passage seen? Since Pilate pester'd Palesteen. On the same. [Could Ashes speak, or Dust prove Eloquent.] Could Ashes speak, or Dust prove Eloquent. Dead Bones would cry, and Martyrs would lament This dismal Darkness, which did blind our Eyes; Which Law conceals, and History denies. This doleful Tragedy may let us see, That God's Permissive (sometimes) in decree. That Men may know, that he can bring to pass Wisely his work, from Satan's Wickedness: E'en so, he from this Super-Treason brings, True Loyalty, to all succeeding Kings. This Bloody, Brutish blow may well detect, What Treason is, and break Rebellion's Neck. For (though 'tis mask'd up, in a smiling dress) This turns it up, and showes it's Nakedness. A Babel's Brat, Engraven with disgrace, A Regicide, with a Religious face. Here's REPUGNANTIA real, or at least Hirco-Cervus, or such another beast. A show of Law, which such fine tricks contains, Can cut off Kings, and break the hearts of Queens. Great Brittain's MONARCH speechless here doth lye; But cryes aloud the Nation's Treachery. His very Name foretold his future state, By Anagram, Cras ero Lux; by Fate. Which Divine Providence to him foretold, The day before he Suffer'd, to uphold Him in his Death; though some ambitious Men Usurp the Glory, to their pedling Pen. His Kingdom was his Cross which now doth burn, And melts all Loyal hearts, to Sigh, and Mourn. He famous was in Life, and Death: yet I Could wish his Life to live, his Death to die. CHARLES STUART. Anagram. Thus A CLEAR STAR, did only set, not die: Parenthisiz'd, not ended Monarchy. King CHARLES the Second, in the Oak. Arbor honoretur, Cujus nos Umbra tuetur: Pretending Salus Populi, To be Suprema LEX; Here CAROLUS was forc'd to fly, When Murdered was REX. [Behold and See] Heb. 5. 8. Although he was the Son, yet did he learn Patience by Suffering. Behold and See, Upon this Tree, The tastless Fruit, of Treason. Whereby we know, That here below, Is little Truth, or Reason. There's nothing sure, That doth endure, By Fate, or Chance, (choose either) Here sits upon This Wooden Throne, Both KING, and PRINCE, yet neither. Loe every Bough, That here doth grow, Make hast, they know not whether; And envelop, Upon his Top, To Crown him altogether. Each Leaf I'll name A Diadem; O Cruel English Nation! These trifles be More true than thee, Loe here's a Demonstration. Then Brittain Great, This Emblem write, And grave it on thy Nature. That henceforth thou May still prove true, And never play the Traytour. On the Return of CHARLES the Second King of Great Brittain, France, and Ireland, &amp;c. Psal. 126. 1. When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion: we were like them that Dream. When I cast up our by past Miseries, And set our Floods of Blood, before mine eyes: And then behold our now-returning King; I'm ready both (at once) to Weep and Sing. But Melancholly, hold; for why should I My smile of gladness, from this joy deny? Since Providence dispenseth us, a-pace Such Miracles of Mercy, Acts of Grace. As lately would have forc'd a States-man say, Such things may be, but per possibile. Our Lawful King, whom we had lost before, No Host of Men; but Angels doth restore. Who's Royal Peace-portending Scepter showes, What Love he to his Loyal Subjects owes: His flaming Sword of Justice doth discry, All Traytours ought, but Regicides must die. Justice and Mercy, sets us up on high: Not as an Object of a new envy; But that (with Int'rest) they may us restore All that we lost, in Civil-War before. Thus 'tis most true, what (commonly) is said, A Morning clear, succeeds an Evening red. A Mournful Elegy, ON The Deplorable Death, of the Thrice Vertuous, Religious, and Renowned MARY, Queen to CHARLES the First, King of Great Brittain, &amp;c. Here lyes she that up did rear, By stooping to a higher Sphere Of Vertue; where her Memory Shall ever live, and never die. She was our Queen, but we ingrate, Threw fewel to her frowning Fate: Who both by Birth, Worth, and Renown, Deserv'd a Kingdom, both, and Crown: Yet she by Fate (or Fortune rather) Had both, and yet possessed neither. She was a Mary by her Grace, An Angel by her comely Face, Who's Parts, and Person, I may call (In most respects) Reciprocal, She with her King, our CHARLES the good, Was almost sunk in Seas of Blood. But both endur'd the Tempests rage, And swam a patient Pilgrimage. Then MARY (since you overcame) Take ARMY for your Anagram. CAROLISMUS. Or, The Loyal Patient, on the Sovereign touch. Mount Divine Muse, with Loyal Wings, and fly Above the Sphere of common Poetry. Touch the Cœlestial Orbs, and sweetly sing, And celebrate the praises of a King: A King who's Race (unless experience lie) Doth bear the Tincture, of a Diety: Who from his Cradle upward, bore his Cross Through Seas of Blood; who's Billows did him toss From Kingdom, (both, and Crown; but (all in vain) The King of Kings restor'd them both again. Yet (though the Crown be purifi'd from dross) The Kingdom (sometimes) makes him bear his Cross. But Providence, Iscariot-Plots detects; And turns them round upon the Traytour's necks. Then Babel's brood, smell (Pope-adoreing band). A Sweaty Toe: I'll Kiss a Sacred Hand, Who's Health-restoring Faculty is such, It cures Diseases, by a Soveraign Touch. Not by your Romith hocus, hear-say tricks: Nor Babilonian, Holy-water bricks. Nor is't a vain sophisticate Relation, Of Pro, or Con, but real Demonstration. Hence then hood-wink'd Impostors; get ye gone, Church-Mountebanks, stain of Religion; Who Controversie end, but in Contention: And work your Miracles, by Apprehension. [One's Name, and Fate, do oft agree] To His Royal Highness JAMES Duke of York. JAMES STEWART: anagram: I: MASTER AT SEA. One's Name, and Fate, do oft agree: So may it with your Highness be, Succesful, both at Land, and Sea. On leaving the W out of the preceeding Anagram. The Royal Name will not admit A W, to dwell in it; Then to the Royal Race, and True, Be Real, Loyal, Single U. JAMES Duke of York. Anagram: Fa. Jes. do my Work. What need I care what Mortal men can say, Whil'st Great JEHOUAH doth a Scepter sway? Meditatio Regalis De Curiæ Conjurationibus. Ejaculatio Spiritualis In Curiæ Conjurationes. Eccles. 1. 14. I have seen all the Works that are done under the Sun, and behold all is Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. Psal. 58. 6. Break their teeth O God in their Mouth: Meditatio Regalis. The Life of Man Is but a Span, That endeth like a Taper. A Royal Crown May tumble down: Promotion's but a Vapour. Ejaculatio Spiritualis. Since thine's the Right, (Withal my might) Good God, I unto thee, Both me, and mine; Do all resign; But only stand for me. Meditatio. The Church doth moan, The State doth groan, And no man knows the Reason. The Court doth cry Conspiracy; The Country eccho's Treason. Ejaculatio. Iscariots, And and all their Plots, Lord frustrate: and deliver Both me, and all Who on thee call; That thou may'st reign for ever. Meditatio. Strength, Wit, and Wealth, Beauty, and Health, Are all but Shaddowes flying: Ther's none that's sure To live one Hour; Our whole Lif's but a dying. Ejaculatio. In Earth, and Heaven, All Power is given, Lord Jesus unto thee; Then (by thy might) Own thou my right; My Sword, and Safe-guard be. Meditatio. Our Life doth run, Below the Sun, Ther's nothing that abideth; 'Tis here to day; But flies away; And in a Moment fadeth. Ejaculatio. Let Justice reign, The Gospel shine, Faith, Truth, and Mercy be Our aim; that all (What e'r befal) May Center'd be in thee. Bellum Intestinum: A Battle 'twixt, Nature, and Grace: Or, A Conference between the Watchful Shephard, and the Sleepy Soul. Gen. 25. 23. The Elder shall Serve the Younger. Cant. 5. 4. My Beloved put in his Hand by the hole of the Door, and my Bowels were moved for him. Rev. 3. 20. Behold I stand at the Door, and knock. Shephard. Awake, poor Soul, and come away From sleep of Sin, 'tis break of day; Make hast; ther's no time to delay. Soul. Thy Invitation I deny: In Worldly Pleasures I do lye; Too sweet (so soon) to be lay'd by, Let those who are decripit Old, Delight to hear such tidings told; When spring of Youth turns winter cold. Shepherd. Me, Angels praise, and Men adore; The Devils tremble, Seas doth roar, Yet flowes no further than her shoar. I with my Hand the Heavens do span, The Wind bind in my fist I can, Yet my delight still is with Man. I di'd, that I Death's Death might be. I gave my Life, for life to thee: And must I thus requited be? Poor Soul, thy Life is but a flower, That springs, and withers in an hour: And Satan stands before the Door. If Death step in, and but make bold Thy short life's Riddle to unfold. Wher's spring of Youth, or winter cold? Soul. I can not leave my Glass of Wine, My dainty fare, Apparel fine, For things, they tell me are Divine. I must carouze a while, and rant: My Revelling's I will not want; And yet (for all) I'll die a Saint. Shepherd. Can Dark, and Light together dwell? The one, the other, doth expel. Such Saints are turned into Hell. Take but a sound advice of me; Leave off the World's base Slave to be; An Hundred fold I'll pay to thee. Thy Life is but a Sorrowes scheme, Thy Pleasures are but flying fame, And dross to what should be thy aim. Soul. Then tell but what thou'lt give to me? And what I must pay back to thee? Or if I shall receive all free? And I will leave this World behind, And follow thee; because I find My joyes do but molest my mind. Shepherd. My Name is Wisdom; and I stand Far off; and yet I'm nigh at hand: He's Wise, that answereth my Command. Thou shalt have me (without a sting) Can make the Dead, Rivive, and Sing; Content (in heart) like any King. And what I give, I give it free; All beings do belong to me: Non entities I call to be. When thou was't Sin, and Satan's slave; I suffered Death, thy Life to save; And ransom'd poor thee, from the Grave. I have the Host of Hell withstood. I Purifi'd thee with my Blood. And this I did, all for thy good. And now (lest Sorrow on the sease) I'm come to give thee (if thou please) Sweet rest, in stead of sensual ease. Thou shalt have earnest in this Life; I'll be thy Husband, thou my Wife: I'll keep thee, in the day of strife. Soul. Put I'm afraid my Faith decay. And if I faint, and fall away; Then ther's no after-time to Pray. Shepherd. I'll love thee freely, and I'll cure All thy Pack-slidings; keep thee sure, As long as life-time doth endure. I'll tie, and draw the up above, With three-fold Cord, Faith, Hope, and Love; And keep thee spotless, like a DOVE. I have a way the Lyon's paw Ne'r trac'd in strength of common Law, Nor Vultur's eye yet ever saw. Then follow me, and do not budge; The stroak of Justice never grudge: I'll be thy Advocate, and Judge. I (by my Spirit) will repell The Devils, who are the gates of Hell: And thou with me shalt ever dwell. I'll Pilot thee unto that shoar, Where neither Sea, nor Billowes roar: Nor Satan gives a broad-side more. To Heaven of Heavens I will thee bring; Thou shalt be Subject, I'll be KING: Where thou shalt never sigh but sing. My Face (for Beauty) thou shalt see: For Riches, Pearl I'll give to thee; And for my Cross, thy Crown I'll be. Ther's ever Light, and wholesome Air: For Food, and Rayment, take no care: 'Tis alwayes Spring, no Winter there. Then ha'st thou Wife, or ha'st thou none; Bring Company, or come alone, Unto thy Host, it is all one. Ther's Roomes enough, none needs to pry, They'r neatly hung, the fabrick's high: But none comes in that makes a lie. Soul. I rise, I come, I run, I fly. My dearest Idol, I deny. I'll follow thee, untill I die. If to the exit of my Breath, Thy Power, Spirit, thou bequeath, I shall endure the sharpest Death. PROMOTION. Esther 7. 9. And the King said, hang him thereon. Promotion is the Pinacle, from whence Pride breakes the neck of a good Conscience. A tot'ring Piramid of guilded Sorrow, That's built to day, &amp; thrown quite down to morrow: For 'tis th' ambitious Man's Eye-soar to see One great; and himself unadvanc'd to be, Then leave the Court, and learn at home to dwell; Lest that you end like wise Achitophel. To a great Oppressour. Prov. 22. 16. He that Oppresseth the Poor to increase his Riches, and he that giveth to the Rich, shall surely come to want. If I should a METEMYU/XWSIS hold, (As did Pithagoras) I likewise would (By Consequence) affirm, and prove it too: That Nero's Ghost inhabited in you. Except (in this) you differ much from him; That he was good in his Quinquennium. But you are Ill, and ever have been so, A Basilisk when in your Embrio. Poor Men, and Beggars, you may freely kill; Because you make as many as you will. On the Q. M. Religion in a twilight-skie, Of wandering dark Apostacy, The Universe survey'd; to find Devotion in a sincere mind. And with a serious look did spy, Our Queen's unspotted Majesty: Whose Orb of Vertue up did rear, Above a Vicious Hymisphere. And coming near unto her Face, To add a gale unto her Grace; She from the World (secure in Sin) Rose up, and took Religion in. Where (like a Lamp, in flaming Zeal) It burns without a parallel. For if a blemish Faith admit, A Pious Life can cover it. Could Bodies but: as Souls be priz'd, And mater be spiratualiz'd, I should determine her to be Angelical, in Pedegree. She is so pure, that sure she must Be Transubstantiate, out of Dust. She's free'd from, Passion, Hate, and Spite: For Innocence, an Adamite: Then learned Reader, tell (I pray) If Angels can be made of Clay. On the D. Y. You half compleated Ladyes all, Whose Parts, and Vertues are but small: Would you Perfection's pattern see? For Wisdom, and for Gravitie. This Lady's Idæa take, and place As't were a Glass; before your Face: That when you cast your Eye upon her, You mind your Vertue, both and Honour. And (tracing her) your Fame may rear, And fly up, to a higher Sphere. Her Name, her Fame, and real Grace Make up a Consort, in her Face. Which (Musick like) without disguise, Doth charm, not cheat beholders eyes. Her praises no Man can rehearse Enough; in prose, nor yet in verse. Believe, or not, then choose you whether, But England shew me such another. On a Beautiful Young Lady. Once Beauty, Vertue, Wisdom, Grace, Conveined in a certain place. And altogether did combine, To make a Feminine Divine: And flying swiftly on a-pace, Did light upon this Lady's face: And having all they stood in need, They to the Work did thus proceed. BEAUTY (to make her all delight) Did bring a Rose, was red, and white: And in a smiling Blush did skip, From Cherry Cheek, to Scarlet Lip. Then VERTUE laugh'd at Beauty's weed, As needful but Secundum quid. And (with a gentle flame) refin'd Her eye, the Index of her mind. Then WISDOME Vertue gave a check, And did her oversight detect; In over-sparkling of her Eye, To tempt to Vite, or breed envy. Then having (with a pierceing flash) Made Vertue proof, of Beauty's dash. The one she ballenc'd with the other; That both might live, and die together. Then GRACE came in a gentle gale, And set her Soul all under sail. And (nimbly) flew a modest race, With all the three, and gain'd her face: And from her Mouth, and sparkling Eye; O'rspread her whole Physiognomy. Yet she no Critick did commence, To Reason slight, or banish Sense, Or set at nought the other three; Because of her precedencie. But granted them a dwelling place, Within the Suburbs of her Face: Subjecting only them to pay Devotion's Tribute, every day. A Divine Poem, on the Unparallel'd and Religious Mrs. M. F. God said to Jeremy seek out, and find, A Righteous Man that's of an upright mind Who seeketh Truth, and Judgment, and for him I'll freely pardon all Jerusalem. These are the latter dayes, wherein abound All Heresies, and Faith can scarce be found: Yet in this Woman, Mortals all may see A Demonstration, of Divinity. In Infancy, all her Acquaintance knew, She promis'd Fruit, before her Blossome blew, But when the Vintage of her age drew nigh, She yeilded Grapes, was ripe in Piety. Her thoughts are all Seraphick Meditations, Her words are pure, Divine Ejaculations. Her workes are such, that in the darkest night, To wandering Souls they give a joyful light. She knowes to quote the Scriptures in each part, As if she had the Bible, all by heart. Her Heart and Soul, in pray'r and praises pants, For Faith, that once was given to the Saints. She in the Truth, resolves to live and die, And fight the whole World of Apostacy. Then spare us Lord (according to thy Word) And view this Woman, e'r thou draw thy Sword. Yet though the World (to us) may seem to lie Blind in a Mist, of dark Apostacy: Yet thy all-seeing eye, can see and keep, More than seven thousand, marked for thy Sheep. On Mrs. S. G. I love a comely Maid, whose face Doth promise Vertue, Wisdom, Grace, And in her smiling blush, and eye, The Summe of all Perfections lye. She's none of those spends half the day, In pinning fine, and goes to play. But in a plain, (yet comely) dress; Looks smartly after business. This is the Pearl which I do prize; The spotless Object, of mine eyes. To Mrs. S. G. Thy comely face, and stedfast eye, Thy Wisdom, Vertue, Chastity, Did (with a blushing flash divine) Subdue this little World of mine. Subjecting humbly me, to pay My sighes for Tribute, every day. 'Tis quite against the Law of War, To murther any Prisoner: And chiefly me, who did surrender To thee, a Feminine Commander, Then let me dwell (though live or die) Under the Sun-shine of your eye. For if your frown of Life deprive, Your smiling look can make alive. Then Phillis dear it is my will That I remain in Prison still: For if thy Heart my Prison be, My Thraldome shall be more than free. An Acrostick on Mrs. J. H. Invincible cruel, yet love's All-delight. Admirable comely, that Suiters dost slight. Ne'r think a Complexion composed of Clay, Endureth for ever, and ne'r will decay. Hark here in thine ear, and I'll tell thee the truth: Once when a Maid passeth the flowr of her youth, Regraiting she oft doth exclaim (though in vain) To think that she Love, did requite with disdain. O then be not cruel, but take to a Mate. Nothing than Old Maids, is more out of date. On Mrs. E. F. Grave Beauty, Wisdome, Chastity, Flew up into Perfection's sky: T' espy a Virgin, did excel, With which they could both live and dwell. And as they seriously did view The Latitude of fifty two: On London's Change, they there did see A Lady FRANK, but nothing free. And as they view'd her ore and ore, They lik'd her still the more and more. Yea when they had severely prov'd her, In all respects, the more they lov'd her. And did determine her to be Of Maids, the sole Monopolie. Erected in a publick place, To serve them for a Looking-Glass. Therefore they flew into her Face, Possessing each their proper place; Concluding all to keep her sure, As long as Life-time should endure. Then Love-sick Lovers, all in fire, That's almost ready to expire, Draw the Effiges of her face; So comely, and so full of Grace. She'll cure you of your vain disease, And set your Languish't Soul at ease: Unless you with a wanton eye, Commit a Rape on Chastity: And force her frown, (instead of smile) To cause you Pennance do a while; 'Mongst those who strive (although in vain) To gain Affection, by a stain. For though at first she seem to be United, to Complaisancie: To shun Extreams, she well doth know, That Vertue in a midst doth goe. Her Face says Come; Heart, Get ye gone: The Torrid, and the Frozen-Zone, Are so well plac'd within her Sphere, That one can with another bear. Yet he that would his bold Armes make, This little World's, proud Zodiack Of all the Signes. must admit none, But purest Virgo all alone. A Passionate Love-Complement TO Mrs. R. G. O thou my Heart, and Soul's delight! And Idol of mine eye! That's Red, and Alablaster-white, In thy Physiognomy: O that thou would'st but yield to me, That little World of thine: I more then Conquerour should be, And (like a Monarch) reign. Was ever one of Adam's Race Compleat, in every part, So amiable in the Face, And loveless in the Heart. Can not my Floods drown thy disdain, Thy frowning Tempest swage; Nor fainting flaming Heart, once gain No ground, nor Weather-gage. Rebecca fair did greatly fear, When Nature strove with Grace: And thou her Name-sake now dost bear A Cruel, smiling-face. Then let old Hate to Love succumb, The Triumph shall be mine; And when our Marriage day shall come, Thou wil't be all Divine. The Luke-warm Lover: OR A Poem sent by J. F. to his Slighting Mrs. Poor simple Girle, think'st thou that I Am so Love-sick for thee to die. Or that my Reason can not rear, Above a Female Hemisphere. Or that my Intellects came so rash on. T' enslave my Soul, to Lov's sweet passion. No no to think be not so vaini That I'm all Liver, and no Spleen: And that my Phancy's bound in Duty, Only to dote upon your Beauty. The superfices of a face, If destitute of inward Grace, Is but a Hedge-Hogg, in disguise, To cheat, and charm Beholder's eyes. Then speak your Mind, and be not Mute: I'm down-right, be you absolute. As Love that's Lazie towards Marriage, Breaks off, and endeth in Miscarriage. And (for the most part) it is seen, That Maids (in age) about sixteen, Have more Sweet-hearts, to suit and wooe them; Then ever after do come to them. Then stand not out, but take advice: A Maid strait-lac'd yields little price. For she that's of a slighting mind, And laughs at Suitors, oft doth find The Rase and Lilly of her May, To fade and wither quite away. When Nature cryes, Thru Fool give place To Hoary Hairs, and wrinkly face, She'll Sigh and Sing, that dismal Song; I have remain'd a Maid too long: And wish to have (although in vain) A slighted Suiter back again In fine fair Maid, forbear to scoff: I do draw near, stand you not off: If you slight me as heretofore, I'll never henceforth love you more. Love's Valedictory: OR J. G. His Farewel to his Mrs. Shall I to one, Whose Heart's like Stone, Imprison'd be in Love. And yet's but said, To be a Maid, And doth Inconstant prove. No sure I'll live a Cæleb life; A Monarch in my mind: Free'd from the Furies of a Wife, That's constant like the Wind. ????????? OR A Word-fight betwixt an English Man, a Dane, and a Dutch. A Dutch, a Dane, and English Man, Carousing with a merry Can. Did (when their Brains were set on high) Strive for Superiority. And (in a rant) began to bring Their Glory, from the greater King. The English said (as in a huff) Mine's Brittain's King; and that's enough, Whom I in no respect will stage With any King, that's in this age. Then said the Denmarker; 'tis true, The Dutch and Dane succumb to you: Your King unparellel'd most be, As sole Commander, of the Sea. The great Mogul thus giveth doom; On him: “He slights the Pope of Rome, “Nor would he give a Scot's Bo-bee, “For Brother Ottoman, and me. And yet our royal race renoun'd, Hath been with Glory's greatness crown'd: And in this one thing equals yours: In being chosen Emperours. And what is more our ANN: (by name) Did wear your Royal Diadem. Yea all the Glory, and Renown That hangs upon Great Brittain's Crown. (In some respect) belongeth now To Denmark, and to Holland too, Since, &amp;c. When York and Lanchaster did bring Their Bloody War, within a Ring. To see it was a great delight, The red Rose hugg, and kiss the white, The flaming Sword before that burn'd Unto a Scepter, streight was turn'd. Even so since Denmark, and the States Of Holland, be unite by Mates, To England's Royal Race, and sky Of unecclipsed Majesty. Let no old rancour, hence remain 'Twixt Brittain, Saxon, Scot, or Dant. Nor let no Controversie be, Nor Bloody War, by Land, or Sea. But saves your lives, &amp;c. The Dutch Man hearing this grew bold, And Swearing Sacrament, he told, Ons heerlijk Hendrick Broeder Deen, Brave grave van Nassow, ook van Spain, Prins van Oranje, needs must be The tweede Ruler of the Sea. He's Hogan Mogan, na Dane blester. Waer he Getrouwt, &amp;c. A Sturdy Scot, then started up; And Preach'd thus ore a rowzing Cup, God bless them all by Land, and Sea, And her's a Health, to all the three. Apage Satan: OR A Poem on the Turk's defeat at Vienna. Hold Passenger and gently jog; I'll tell rhee news of Hamon-gog: A Beast-like Man, half Horse and Hogg: Was ape to Alexander. Who (confidently) did presume, That he could conquer Christendome, And overthrow the Pope of Rome; And be the World's Commander. Therefore he did together call, His Janizaries great and small: And he on Germany did fall: And camp'd against Vienna. But as his Mufty up did rear, This new Seraglio, in the Air, The Christians panted forth a pray'r, Did fright him like Gehenna. There came an Army from the East, Resolv'd the Riddle of the Beast, Made Magog march, and fly in hast, And leave his Tools behind him. But now (as mad in great dispair) He threatens Pope, and Prince of Air: Therefore let Christians all take care, For chains of Balls to bind him. His Holiness, and Majesty Call'd Christian; can not well deny, To aid the German with supply, That never will surrender. Then Hogan Mogan, Sweed and Dane, Unite your Forces all with Spain: Let Brittain's Monarch rule the main; And prove true Faith's Defender. He's a Pedantick, Bedlame-Tom, That fights a Neighbour King at home, To pimp the Turk, to Christendome: To cause the fire run further, He to Grand Seignior quotes an ace, That Ottoman may turn the chase, And root out every Royal race, And Loyal Subjects Murther. The wandering World see with their eyes, Who 'tis himself that deifies, The Father and the Son denies, And since the Beast is wounded: Pray live in peace and love, at home, And fight the Foe of Christendome, That he whose right it is may come, And Babel be confounded. Rejoyce in Triumph: OR A Plaudite on the Ottoman's defeat at Vienna. I'm glad to hear the Cannon roar, Resounding from the German shoar, Better news, than heretofore: That Babel's Beast is wounded: Then Christians brave, both all, and some, Charge with Horse and Kettle-Drum, The Enemy of Christendome; Till Turks be quite confounded. The King of Poland in a phraze, The great Grand Seignior did amaze; And with a noise his siege did raise, Couragious Solymanus If thou resolv'st to come again, Thou must recruit both might, and main: Or else it will be all in vain, To think that thou'lt trapan us. His Christian Majesty of France, Doth Booty play, the German dance, And he doth laugh at our mischance, Himself he dare not venter. But pimp the Beast, to Babels Whore, And he Bo-peep stand, at the door, Until the wanton Cannon roar: Then Hector like he'll enter. But shite on Turk, and great Mogul, A Pox upon the Scarlet Trull: And we the Poppie too dare pull, If CHARLES but be Commander. For (though the neutral seem to be) He can command both Land and Sea, And overthrew the big-look'd three; And trace brave Alexander. Then let no rancour joyn'd with hate, Make Ruptures in the Church or State: But all submit to divine fate, And keep within our border. Let none old England then forsake; Since Crownes and Kingdomes ly at stake, A Forreign War to undertake, Till CHARLES give further order. The German tell that heretofore They Captive took one Bull and Boar; The Minotaurus of a Whore, That roar'd like any thunder. Then P. P. could this be, The Bugg-bear ramphant of the Sea, Whose army was to fight with thee, And force the World to wunder. But Ottoman pray get thee gone: The Christians doe but draw you on, They'l greater booty have or none, And if you'l not prevent it If e're you turn your Face this way, We'l make the Cannon Musick play, And you must dance the York-shire hay, Till all your Bauds lament it. Then fill the Piss-pot to the Swine, Heap me a rouzing Glass with Wine, The dancing Thames shall pledge the Rhyne, And Tyber shall be Preses. Then here's to CHARLES that rules the main, To Poland, Holland, Sweed, and Dane: To Germany, and brave Lorrain, But pray you Potus ne sis. A Song, Sung by the Greenwich-Green-coats, to shew their thankfulness, to their adopted Father, and Entertainer; The Right Honourable, Sr. William Boreman, Knight. Some doe conclude Ingratitude, To be the chief of Evils: And every Brat, That is Ungrate, Not like to Men, but Devils. Then why should I My Mite deny; I'll pay it ev'ry hour Man; My voice I'll raise, My God to praise, And bless Sir William Boreman. He doth me feed, And likewise breed, In Fruitfull education. Whereby I know, To undergoe A Christian vocation. If speechless I Were like to dye, And but to live an hour Man: My leaping Heart Should play it's part, And sigh Sir William Boreman. A thing that's bought Is good for nought And filthy Lucre meerly: But he did bring An Offering, Was good, and gave it freely. My God above I'll fear and love, Though I should dye a poor Man, I'll Honour bring, Unto my King, And bless Sir William Boreman. All gifts decay, And fade away; But Divine love doth never. T'is allwayes seen To Flourish Green, And doth endure for ever. My comely dress, That's Green like Grass, Showes that it will endure then, T' immortalize, And cannonize, The brave Sir William Boreman. Then Green-coats all, Both great and small, I do you all adjure then; Both Night and Day, You ever pray, God Bless Sir William Boreman His obsequies Shall be our cryes; His funeral our Mourning: Untill he Fly Above the sky; From whence is no returning. A PROLOGUE To a play entituled, The Indian Empress. A TRAGEDY acted by some young Ladyes at Green-wich. This is that famous place; where once did dwell Our Virgin Queen, who did her sex excell. Then we her train may enter, (not intrude, With in her Sphere;) yet in her Latitude: To chear our minds, beyond the sink of sorrow, As lesser Stars: Therefore we dare to borrow, A Beam of boldnesse, from her Mid-day sky; And pay't in blushes, to her Memory. Then Noble Sirs, and vertuous Ladyes all, And you beholding hearers, great, and small. W'are not come here, fond Fopp'rys to defray; Dark riddles, and Enigmas to display: Nor Exorcisms, and spels of Eloquence, To captivate sound Reason, unto sense. Nor great exploits of valour to rehearse, Which ne're was heard before; in Prose, or Verse: No no you are mistaken, pray forbear; Such Antick tricks are far below our Sphere. Of this our present Meeting, the intent Is but to have some grave divertisement: To elevate our modest mindes on high, To chase black Melancholy, from the sky Of our chast thoughts; which dare not once commence Beyond the blush, of modest confidence: Nor are we so much captivate with fears, To fawn our Words, in favour with your Ears: Nor lop the Logicks, for fine Sylogisms; To dispossesse your Mindes of Criticisms. We no Apology to Criticks make; Since what we please to give, they needs must take, Or let alone: because the very same May relish us, that favours not with them. And 'tis a Maxim, that he's ne'r at ease Who strives the humours of all men to please Yet hope the Dishes of this Tragick-feast Shall neither be so Tastless, nor ill drest; To cause the Taster, afterwards repent, Nor think when he is gone, the time ill spent. The subject's not so soure, but that one may Suck sweet from it, and carry witt away. None can expect a tender Bud that Springs, To equalize the Fruit, that Autumne brings The year is more than common kinde to him, Who puls ripe Grapes, before the vintage come. Even so the first Fruits of our sixteen years, Comes short to that which thirty and odd bears. Then (in good part) to take, pray be content, What humbly to your Patience, we present. And all we beg your clemency is this, You pick the good, and cover what's amiss. EPILOGUE. We bring no after claps to soure your sweet, As when good fellows at a Tavern meet: Who having sung, and drunk their sorrows down; The Land-Lord sings the dismall Reckoning Tune, We cure not Melancholy by disease; We crave no coyn, nor thanks, unless you please, The tender buds of our young smiling spring We did present, a free-will offering. Thus if your Dishes have been badly drest; Your Pockets are not with rewards opprest. And yet this play no Prentise is in sport; It serv'd it's time (in Confidence) at Court. And what is more, (without a trembling fear) Found welcome access, to his Sacred Ear. I hope it may then with your credit stand, To tast his Dishes, though at second hand. For (though they be set in another frame.) The substance of the play is still the same. Yet all at first we profered was this, Y'are welcome (if ye please) to share with us But if ye have not found a recreation, Agreeing to your Amorous expectation. W'are not to blame, nor was it ever known, A Tree to bear; the Blossom yet unblown. Then pray accept (for all that is your due) This earnest of respects, we owe to you: And we shall pay (when witt accutely bears,) Your sum of Service, in our riper years. Another PROLOGUE To Criticks Auditors and Spectators. Wee'r not come here, to please your Pallats; By singing Tuns, and Ryming Ballads: As if w' had nothing else to doe, But cut out curious knacks for you: And as our actions did depend Upon a not concerned hand; No sure; we Act this Tragick play, No Master-piece, but an Essay Of our fresh wits; and not of sense: To learn a Modest confidence. All wanton words we doe defy, Our Tongues are tip'd with Modesty; And all vain objects we despize; Behold us then with pure, chast Eyes. And if your expectation finde A Passage, pleasing to your minde, Thrice Noble Sirs, and Ladyes grave, We humbly your acceptance crave. And this is all that we require, We shall fulfill our whole desire. But if it be your hardened will To Carp, and play the Critick still: The Garter-Gamball we will dance, Call'd, Honi soit qui Mal y pense. The A-B. C. On the slow building of St. Pauls Church. 2 Sam. 7:2. The King said unto Nathan the Prophet, see now, I dwell in an House of Cedar, but the Ark of God dwelleth within Courtains. I Blush for shame, and sigh as I pass by; To see God's house, thus like a Dung-hill ly. When City, and the Suburbs both are done, And built in querpo-cut, with Brick, and Stone. This Demonstration is enough, to prove Us froze in Zeal, and but luck-warm in Love. Our Saviour went, us Mansiones to prepair, And shall not we this one Hou's ruins rear, I'll say no more, but sigh, and pray, that we, May our King CHARLES the Zerobabel see. AN ELOGIUM, On D. C. Minister of Marget, in the Isle of Thannet. This is the Pearl-like-Porch, through which first came The Gospel-light, to our Jerusalem: Which with a gracious Gale, or splendent ray, Did blow, and banish Atheism away. The Divine Porter of this Sacred gate Is one, whom Church, and State Homologate. No Wolf, nor Hireling, nor the World's Slave. But left the Fleece, that he the Flock might save. No private malice, nor Hypocricy, Doth choak his word, 'ere it can Fructifie. No legall Warr, compulsion, nor constraint, Doth force his Flock (in frowns) to pay him rent. He cares to feed the old, with divine truth; And in good learning, educate their youth. His fervent pray'rs prevail at Sea and Land; With him who made the Sand, a swadling band. He prayes his People safe, and they doe bring A gratis gift, or free-will offering. Thrice happy Preacher, yea and hearers all; Where both embrace, in Love reciprocal. O Divine Saint! in all respects compleat; Who in the fall of Years sends forth such fruit. The Island I In terminis appeal, To show another, that's his Parellel. His R. H. D. Y. to S. G. G. H. When he was made Chancellour of S. Deserving Subject, of a Loyal Name; Which to our Race, hath ever prov'd the same The Chanc'lor's place we do confer on you, As earnest, of your summe of merits due. Till Death, not fault; that cannot be suppos'd In you, we have such confidence repos'd. It were a the's well worthy of the Press, If Loyalty such can take more or less. Then grudge not envy; though I dearly prize His Son, who died Rebellion's Sacrifice, For him—But hold my Passion I'll refrain, Lest I discover Brittain's blot again. Thrice Loyal then, mind (and I'll add no more) What Phæbus said to Phaeton before. The London-folly. Act. 18. 23. For as I passed by and beheld your Devotions, &amp;c. In London, as I walk'd up Fish-street Hill, I saw a Tow'r or Alter (which ye will) Whose lofty top was elevate so high, It touch'd the Clouds I thought, and pierc'd the Skie. I had concluded (but I saw it Stone) That it had been the Tow'r of Babylon. I could not read th' Inscription, which it had; But meeting with a Passenger, I said; Pray Sir, what means this Phancie, and what need Is there of such a stately Pyramid. “My Friend (said he) our City hath been burn'd “Of late, and unto dust and ashes turn'd. “Therefore we built this Tow'r of hewen Stone: “A Monument thereof, to watch upon, “And this our case at present doth require, “Lest that we perish from the Earth, by Fire. I answer'd, it had been more Christian, T' have built a Church, where first the Fire began; A place convenient both for Pray'r and Praising, And not an Object only fit for gazing. Though Night &amp; Day, you keep by Might &amp; Main, Unless God watch the City; al's in vain. But I admire the Phancie, and can tell, I saw a Statue-Steeple without a Bell; And 'tis Devotions Paradox, to see A Chimney set up, where a Church should be. The French Tropick-bird Or Madam Travalzie's Train. Ha ha a Woman with a Tail! That's full six yards long, and a nail: Of all vain fashions this is one, Was never seen by Solomon. Shall I believe mine own Eyes, That gravity suits such disguise. An object such I never saw, But Sheep once in Arabia. O pardon Madam my mistake, I took you for a Rattle-snake; Or else the bird that's call'd Cuckow, That keeps a subsequent like you. But Lady Long-tail if you please, I will you of your burden ease: Tye to your britch a bag to bear it, Your Jack-page Rapier will not tear it. And you Tail-bearing Gentleman; Lest contrar-windes make Hurrican, When you perceive, a North-East gale Stand clear, and hale the Mizen-sail. A POEM presented to one whose Loyalty was Suspected. These Wind-work vapours which doe fly, Like Snow-Balls squirted at your skie, To batter down your Loyalty. Are but the emblems of disdain, Or Cob-web squibs, that's thrown in vain: which without blot, fall off again. Then let Beelzebub tear and shout Among the mad distracted rout, Till he come who can cast him out. A Reply to a Pasquil: OR A sound Advice to the Unknown Author of the Ironical Rhyme, or Satyr written on his Grace, the D. of M Entituled Jemmy Returned. Peace Poetaster, parasite of time; Thou flattering Sycophant, disgrace of ryme: Who with Ironic jeers, dost strive to sport, And fawn thy self, in favour with the Court. Think'st thou His Royal Highness, or the KING, Desires 'timist protæus, to bring A Coward's quill, that's diped in disgrace: T' offront his Son, and stain the Royal Race. The great Apostate Julian, taught thee this, To Murther Monmouth, with a Judas-Kiss. Pedantick Rymer, thy Muse is a Mine: Thy quil's the Arrow of a Porcupine. Which will at last turn Immanent, and dart The sqint-ey'd Archer, deeply to the Heart. Turn ore the leaf, but of this present age, Bring Bo-peep's Pasquils back upon the stage. Thoul't find such Lybels (more than any thing) Bred Civil War; which murthered our King. Mind him who said: Insipid Wretch of Nature, I love the Treason, but I hate the Traytour. Perillu's Bull: OR A Blow to the Hang-Man. Thou Homo-brutus (out of doubt) That's Beast within, and Man without; Whose Name's enough to over vex Thee Hang-man, or thee Carnifex. Presum'st thou that thoul't never die, But live to all Eternity: To shun the wages, of thy trade: Which Justice surely will have pay'd. Thou Wicked Wretch dost thou not fear, That thou'rt the Scape-goat, that dost bear The guilt of guiltless Blood that's shed, By False Accusers; and art made The Rod, of God's great Indignation: To Plague, and Punish every Nation. Know then thou Beast with Humane Face, As God to Man, gives Grace for Grace. So he from him that hath not, takes That little which he hath; and makes Him Execute his Just Decrees, Of Vengeance: as to this agrees Proud Pharoah, whom he did obdure, To show his Justice and his Power; And set him up, that he might be A Caveat, to Posteritie. Then (to conclude) O Poor Man know, Offences sure must come; but woe To him, by whom: O thrice forlorn! It had been good he'd ne'r been born. On the Memory Of the Right Honourable, the Earl of OSSORY. Rebels hold off, and Traytours come not nigh These Sacred ashes, of pure Loyalty. 'Tis Ossory lyes here, Good, Just, and Wise, Who stop'd the Flood-gate of your Villanies; Of noble Race, and of a Loyal Line; Politique States-man, and a grave Divine, Courage in Heart, and victory in Hand: A brave Commander, both at Sea and Land. Had he but liv'd like others of his Race; And to his Inward joyn'd his outward Grace. He from base Plots had clear'd the Kingdom's sky; And freed the State from Clouds of Treachery; He'd turn'd the Chase; and forc'd (within a while) Grim-look'd Rebellion blush into a smile. Great Brittain sighes, and Ireland loud doth cry; The States of Holland wipe a wat'ry Eye. The love of all he had, of none the Hate; The Church Companion, and a Friend to State. I think I hear his mourning eccho cry, Religion, Wisdom, Valour, Loyalty. An ELEGY, ON Mr. John Forbes, late Sheriff of Aberdeen in Scotland. Here lyes his dust, who did himself behave In all respects, both Loving, Wise, and Grave. A Man of Learning, Knowledge, and such Grace; As did become his Pedegree, and place. In Righteous Causes, he did never grudge, To play the part of Advocate and Judge. He all his life time, kept before his Eye, The Principle, of real Piety. He starv'd the mouth of Envy, and did gain The love of those once had him in disdain. A man of Courage, yet base broils abhor'd; And brought all discords unto Bon-accord. Now Oratrie, and all the Muses nine, Are not enough his person to define. For when the King of Terrours took him hence, He stop'd the Mouth of purest Eloquence. Had he not liv'd within a Northen mist, Tost 'twixt the Waves of Pope and Calvenist. He might have to his Nation been a fame, And eterniz'd Admirable by name. Then rest in hope (Dear Saint) and quiet lye, Till he return who 'scended up on high. A Mournful ELEGY. ON Mr. I. K. who Died in KENT in ENGLAND. The World's a trifle, and the life of Man A hand in bredth, in Longitude a span. Our Pleasures are but Pain; our Joyes relent, Before the Morning of our dayes be spent. I've seen a Dunce, prefer'd before a Wit, Base Beggars ride, when Princes walk'd a foot. To swift or strong, by chance, no prize at all: But God doth send, what ever doth befal. Then why should I repine, my Heart reply'd, The finest Gold is often purified. This Object of our present Grief and Woe, What I affirm without debate may show; Whose Partes and Person, readiness of Wit, Did of no Blot, or Blemish base admit. Religion's root ne'r wither'd nor decay'd In him: till he Lif's utmost minute pay'd. Oft Satan snatch'd; but he could only roar; The God of Truth had muzzl'd him before. Then (charitable Reader) write me down, A Christian cros'd doth wear an endless Crown. On the Memory of a Married Maid. Within this Coffin here doth lye, A Pattern of pure Chastity. A Non such-sight (as it is said) A Wife, a Widow, and a Maid. Whose Modesty did her restrain, A Marrie'd-Virgin to remain. Who willingly, not by constraint, Was pleas'd to live by Complement. Her Youth and Beauty still did plead Divorcement, from her Maiden-head. Yet Chastity did gain the cause: The civil beat down Natur's Laws. I could speak more here to her praise, And force beholders all, to gaze. But that I think her Ashes cry, Hold Gentle Muse for Modesty. On the death of a hopeful young Boy. Within this little Box doth ly Ripe wisdome, yet in Infancy. Like Homer's Iliads in a Nut, Full four score and ten here are shut In single five, a Childe, whose years Are written down in Characters. Then Reader gaze not, but behold This young old Childe, as Esay told. AN EPITAPH On the Brother of Heliogabolus. Within this Tombe lyes one, I can Scarce nominate a Brute, or Man But yet the veritatem loqui, He borrow'd partem, ab utroque. His Definition was a Stipes, Or animal implume bipes. He spent his time here in a mist, A Papist, yet no Atheist. He liv'd by robries, and oppression; Whereof (at Death) he made Confession. His fame still cry'd he liveth ill: And now he's dead, against his will. REGICIDA Or AN EPITAPH; On the first Death, and second Burial, of the great Traytour, and Usurper; OLIVER CROMWELL ANAGRAM. O Vile, Cruell Worm. Come Tribe of Judas, and condole, The rotten Ruins, of old Nol. That's frighted up, without a Soul. Great Britan's Butcher here doth ly, Who did up from a Dung-hill fly, In Treason, to pro notion's sky. Whence, (for Eclipsing Sun, and Moon, And aiming at a Royal Crown) The King of Kings did hurle him down. He was insatiate in desire; And all his life time did aspire; And now (when dead) he's jump't up higher. He cut the Church quite off at knees; And set on Fire, both Land and Seas; And Father'd all, on Gods decrees. He was sworn Enemy to good; A Canibal of Babels brood; Did eat Men's Flesh, and suck their blood. In life, he plagu'd us with Protection: And now (when dead) makes Insurrection; And Threatens the World, with Infection. The curse of Kings, of Queens the bane, Who did the Universe so stain; That Earth hath spu'd him up again. Then pray Historians mention not, The kiss of this Iscariot: But let his Memory quite rot. Then Traitours tremble and give o'r To Plot your projects, any more: Lest that you split, on treason's shore. Although your Stubborn Hearts be stout In villanies, yet out of doubt, The King of Kings will finde you out. ON DEATH, Mors ultima linia rerum. Death is lif's exit, and the Porch whereby All men doe enter long Æternity: Upon the left the half-gat's open wide; On right the Wicket's only lay'd aside. Then stoope down low, when young; &amp; boldlywenter, For truckling thou mayst fall, before thou enter. By all espoused it is still confest, That the first proffer's (commonly) the best; There are no Suiters for thy Soul but one, And thou may'st dye a Foole, when he's once gone. Ther's no contentment in our Worldly joyes; They puff to pride, which but the Soul destroyes; Then wast not time, for thy time is not long; Lest Death prevent thy lovely Marriage-Song. He's blest who Sings back from Mount-Zion high, Death, wher's thy Sting? Grave, wher's thy Victory? A POEM On The STATUE ROYAL, Erected in the Center of the EXCHANGE of LONDON. Tell me no more how Memnon's Statue stood, Which (but by hear-say) sounded forth aloud. Nor of that Golden, Artificial Head, Which prattl'd Nonsense, by Albertus made. Nor of that fluttering Dove that flew amain, To welcome Julius; and rerurn'd again. These are but Fopp'ries, here's a Demonstration Which to a greater Cæsar hath Relation. A stately Statue, elivate on high, T' immortalize our CHARLES his Memory. This, is a Merchant's Mite, which doth but show What Faithful Summe this City doth him owe. Then Loyal London, keep before thine eye, This as the Center, of thy Gravity. That frowning Tempests from the Royal Skie, May neither beat, nor break thy Loyalty From him, this represents: but still endure Like Marble, and like Alablaster pure Unspotted: that all Forreigners may see This Chirogliphick of Fidelitie.
