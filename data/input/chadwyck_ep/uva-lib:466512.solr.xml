      <field name="fulltext">TO MISS LANDON, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY ONE OF THE MOST ARDENT ADMIRERS OF HER GENIUS, AND MOST SINCERE OF HER FRIENDS. VOLUME I. THE STIRRING DAYS OF OLD. Bright were the stirring Days of Old, When Chivalry's proud sons and bold Their shining feats performed; Faith, and Enthusiasm, and Zeal, Clad them in proof from head to heel, And their brave spirits warmed. Bright, stirring, glorious Days of Old! When shall we more your like behold On this dull Earth below! Ye're past, and much hath passed with ye Of fair and famous, fine and free, Which we no more may know! Then for some high and worthy prize Did knights to combat bold arise, Fired with true Valour's glowâ The measured lists were marked and traced, The crested champion firmly faced His helmed and haughty foe! Then watched around the courtly crowd, Then rang the bugle sharp and loud, Then spoke the Herald forthâ Then were the styles of each proclaimed, And met the antagonists, far-famed, To try their martial worth. By high endeavour, glorious strife, Were beautified this barren Life, And roused keen hopes and fearsâ Even as their aims were high and bold, So did their spirits' powers unfold In those romantic years. The stately, stirring, olden days! When honour, and renown, and praise, Were dear to every heart! The natural glow of honest pride Too often now seems thrown aside, These days are days of Art! The elevation and the zeal Too seldom is it ours to feelâ Too seldom shine displayedâ Different these days from days of Old! All is more cautious now and coldâ And measured, proved, and weighed! The stirring, glorious, olden days!â Oh! they shall win our meed of praise, Midst all our toils and caresâ While something like a dim regret For grandeurs sunk, and glories set, Man's living spirit shares! WEEP NOT FOR ME. Weep not for meâOh! no, weep not!âOh! never weep for meâ But pass along thy happier path, in gladness and in gleeâ Weep not for meâOh! no, weep notâit would but be in vain, 'Twould but increase my suff'ring, 'twould redouble ev'ry pain. Let me see nought but joy and cheer upon thy bright young brow, Though sorrow darkly dwells on mineâand many a shadow now, A something like reflected hope, shall hovering, trembling play, 'Midst sorrow and 'midst shadows then, o'er mine with meteor-ray. Through all my bitter trials, and through all my heavy woes, That lengthen on and gather more, as they would never close, Oh! may I ever still behold, and still beholding, bless Unenvyingly, in others, such sweet signs of happiness! Then weep thou not for me, my LoveâOh! weep thou not for me, But still fulfil thy fairer fate, with gladness and with glee, So shall a soft reflected ray of pleasure light my soul, Enough to illume my shortened path unto my shadowy goal. HADDON HALL. Haddon! beneath thy dark walls frowning, Which but the ghostly Ivy's crowning, I muse upon the past! Thou breath'st of old heroic story, Legends of love and martial glory, Of things too bright to last. How did the Knights, with bold endeavour, Here hand to hand, despairing never, Dispute the radiant prizeâ And royal banquets cheered them after, Where all was song, and mirth, and laughter, And light from ladye's eyes. Then from the dais proud and splendid To where the lengthened board was ended, All, allâwas glee and cheerâ Peasant and follower hastened hither, The vassal and his lord together Feasted as pheer with pheer. Of old these grass-grown courts resounded, These wild-weed terraces abounded With movement and with mirth, Of music and of merry doings, Of courteous words, and courtly wooings, There was no lack nor dearth. Forth from these gates did ofttimes sally The Falconer, clad in green suit gaily, With hawk upon his fistâ While Ladye bright, paced slow and wary, With tassel gentle, light, and airy, Placed on her dazzling wrist. The Ladye bright the sport attended On palfrey decked with housings splendid, And made her stately way Through the proud knightly crowd admiring, Each to a beamy smile aspiring, Which shone with heavenly ray. How did the gallant hawk soar proudly, While deepened long and echoed loudly The cheery Ã  le vol!â Each heart with expectation fluttered, Each lip the cryâthe challenge uttered, It stirred the very soul! Haddon! thy bright days are departed, And one unblessed and mournful-hearted Sighs in congenial sort; O'er thy dark walls and terrace lonely, Where sport the bat and raven only, And o'er thy grass-grown court. The Heart midst scenes thus silent musesâ Ah! Ruins have their hallowed uses, And point, and prompt, and preach To stabler statesâof surer seasonsâ When Time shall cease his haughty treasons, And much they mark and teach. They teach, with mouldering towers and portals, How vain the work of mould'ring mortals, How fleeting their estateâ They nothing of the truth dissemble, But show us, while they sink and tremble, Our Future and our Fate. But can we, on such subjects dwelling, When heavily the heart is swelling, Our loftier hopes forget? Can we forget this truth transcendant, That ours may be Heaven's realms resplendent, When this Life's sun is set? AND WOULD'ST THOU HAVE IT SO? And would'st thouâwould'st thou have it so, My lifeâmy loveâmy all below? And is it thy sweet sovereign will? And dost thou claimâcommand it still?â So let it be then!âmine own treasure! So let all be that gives thee pleasure! All things but thee have past away, Not for myself I hope or pray; Not for myself can seek or strive, For love and thee alone I liveâ One aim is mine, and one endeavour To serve thee and to stead thee, ever. All things but thee have past away (Which charmed me in a former day!) From my clear, couched, and piercing eyes!â I mock at Life's light vanitiesâ From my long fatal dream arising, Abhorring these things and despising. Yet, e'en these must I learn to prize, And look upon more loving-wise, If they thy dear regard can gain, And clasp thee in their twining chain; For with thine eyes would I be seeing, I would exist but in thy being. These must I cherishâthese must love, If thou applaud them and approve, And in all honour hold them still, If they can bid thy young heart thrill With aught of prideâwith aught of pleasureâ My only hopeâmy only treasure! I laugh to scorn Life's petty strife, And all that appertains to Lifeâ But, Oh! when it regardeth thee, Its Shadows seem Reality! And all I scarce deemed worth disdaining, Is then my inmost soul enchaining! Still when I think of theeâof thee, Those things I scorned appear to be Too costly in their preciousnessâ Too mighty or to curse or bless!â Such power o'er me art thou possessing, My only blissâmy only blessing! The veriest trifleâlightest toy, That can bring thee a dream of joy, To me at once is proudly worth All the heaped treasure of the Earth! So much on Passion am I pouring The Soul that lives but in adoring! And would'st thouâwould'st thou have it so? I must obey before I know, Before thy word is breathedâ'tis done, For theeâin thee I live alone!â So much I love thee and so madly, Oh! how supremelyâthough how sadly! LINES WRITTEN BY THE SEA-SIDE. Ye Cliffs! that do delay the Setting Sun To shine in glory, your proud piles upon, In parting gloryâhallowed and serene, That crowns at once and consecrates the scene! Scarce can the pained and pomp-bewildered eye Dwell on the effulgence of your blazonry! Scarce can that eye your dazzling splendours fix, As though of jasper and of sardonyx, Of sparkling diamond, and the emerald stone, And sapphire (like the violet flower full blown!) As though of ruby deep and opal clear, Lustrously built your radiant walls appearâ A solid Rainbowâso diversified Is now your glittering panoply of pride! For every colour streams along the sky, And ye reflect intensely every dye! And still your fair and shining walls do seem, While changeful hues along them glow and stream, Of flaming gems with cost and cunning builtâ And graved and polished, carved, and wrought, and gilt. Yesâformed of jewellery most rich and rare They well might seem, and built with cost and care! And yet their splendour and their proud array Will fleetly die off with the dying day! 'Tis all yon Setting Sun's workâbrief and bright!â He bathes these rocks in luxury of light! He tints them as he tints the clouds around His Western Throneâwith blaze of colouring crowned; And all doth radiantly and richly shine With living lustre, perfect and divine. How rapidly the brilliant change was madeâ How suddenly these Cliffs in pomp arrayedâ How soon these gem-like splendours shone completeâ How gloriously the astonished sense they greet! And mark, how long enshrined in the under earth, Ere it attains at length effulgent worth, The encrusted gem must veiled and hidden lie, Slow travelling towards its bright maturity! Though ceaselessly with constant nurture fed By the Tartarean fires of that dark bed. But thou, Oh! Sun! the touch ev'n of thy rays Hath lit these heights with a most dazzling blaze; A blaze too brilliant for the unguarded eye, Intense in its rich-coloured radiancy, Bright as the ring-dove's changeful neckâor train Of sumptuous peacock dyed with many a stain! The deep reflection of thy parting smile Hath robed these rocks that harshly frowned erewhile In sullen gloomâa stern and shadowy fileâ With cloudless gloryâvarious to the view As even the diamond's changefulness of hue; Never can eyes or heart forget the glow Of this Autumnal Sunset's wond'rous show, Had such displayed on painter's canvass been, Perchance we had condemned the splendid scene, Condemned it as outstepping boldly far Fair Nature, whom we deem excess would mar. But Oh! it is not so!âin sooth we err, Ourselves denying, we disparage her; For she knows not to stint, nor deigns to spare, But pours her boundless riches free and fair, Even as the Sun doth pour his light away, Nor shows less bright on each succeeding day! But still with harmony in each excess, As all who know, who prize her, shall confess! Ne'er on the boundaries of a perfect grace Dost trespass, through the immensities of space, Oh! glorious Nature, ne'er is thy proud scene Marred by strained pomps with startling breaks between, But all thy Splendours mixed, and mellowed glow, Thy Beauties all into each other flow; And more, even in thy rich excess we see Of the fine truth of thy just modesty! When we attempt, with weak and wavering hand, To trace these beauties, boundless as they're bland, How are we forced to wrong the wond'rous pride, Which still in thy fair aspect is descried, Because, where we would open and display The o'erpowering glory of thy bright array, We miss those finer strokesâthose tenderer shadesâ Through which thy Pomp all vulgarer glare evades, We miss those heavenlier hints, those happier hues, Which subtly thy sweet countenance suffuse, And ev'n one tint the more, one touch the less Can stain thy fair Perfection's pure excess. Thereforeâto escape the exaggeration's blame, We must consent to make our copyings tame; Thereforeâwhen we thy glorious forms would trace, We half defraud thee of thy pride and grace, And doubt what every day and hour we see Perforce, of thy proud prodigality, We judge thee thus by our own want of skill, And make our own weak works thy standard still; And since to thy great charms we are untrue, Since we're constrained to stint thee of thy due, And in our poor attempts thus weakly fail, We dream thou wearest, too, the shadowing veil, That thou dost, too, each dazzling show repress, And shrink from gorgeous splendours of excess! Fair cliffs! that wear an hundred diadems, That seem yourselves all built of burnished gems, And yet whose pomps and glories thus are born Even of a momentâfrail as dews of mornâ Ye make me think of things, whose hallowed truth Should long have thrilled the watchful heartâin sooth, You make me think how far the jewel stone Is shrined deep, deep i'th' Earth, veiled, bound, unknown, And of the toil and labour man bestows To wrench it from its long and lone repose; While Providence pursues one gracious plan, Still for the advantageâfor the good of man. And even in this, as in all other things, Whate'er the veil it o'er its purpose flings, Consults his truest interests and his weal, And seeks his deep and lasting bliss to seal. 'Tis therefore surely for his own high sake To excite his energies, his powers to awake, The things he learns to covet and to prize, That charm his fancy and that please his eyes; That form his treasures and that swell his pride, With all his pomp and all his state alliedâ The princely splendours of the gloomy mine, They that await his touch and call, to shine, Are placed beyond his sightâbeyond his reach, Labour's supreme necessity to teach; To win him to exertionâand to unwind The dormant energies within his mind, (Coiled up supine, until aroused at length By something that demands their wakeful strength.) For this the glittering gemâthe glowing gold Are wound and wrapped with many an earthly fold, Hid in the mine's recesses, and unknown, Till skill and industry make these their own; Snatch them from out their dark and dismal bed, And give them to reflect the light instead! Then borne from their profound and ancient home, So dim and dull in its eternal gloom, They many a brilliant scene of pomp adorn, Bright as the blushing smile of Orient Mornâ Fair as the rainbow of resplendent dyes, That clasps its Belt of Beauty round the skies, The Cestus of Creation!âever bright As when it first flushed warm the laughing light! The Cestus of Creationâwhich bestows A mystic charm where'er it shines and glows. Then do they glitter forth in all their pride, The Monarch's sumptuous offering to his Bride! The Conqueror's spoils, the Merchant's splendid boast, The Altar's ornament, of boundless cost; But though thus hidden, and embedded deep, Within the bowels of the earth they sleep, And ask man's laboured care and patient toil To clear them from the close-embracing soil, To free them from the dust and dross, because 'Tis one of Heaven's profound and sapient laws That Difficulty still should of Success Remain the strict Condition, and no less, The life and soul of its enjoyment, too, Still robing it with charms for ever new; Enhancing still its pleasure and its pride, (And lending it delightsâalone supplied By that keen glow of feeling, which they share Who conscious of their own proud conquests are, Who know that they, with strong and steadfast aim, The stubborn obstacles at length o'ercame; And who can say, with high and honest pride, âI thrust the obstructions and the bars aside, I dared the task, and I performed the deed, And mine 'tis now to grasp the promised meed.â) Yea! though, thus hidden, and thus darkly shrined In Earth's deep bosom, with these treasures lined, The burning gems must masked and folded lie Full long concealed from every gazing eye. Lo! mark how graciously doth Heaven contrive At once, all-powerful, to deny and give! Oh! mark the bounty of the indulgent sky O'er man still showeredâev'n inexhaustibly, Since while it doth, with purpose sage, demand Toil and exertionâfor his interest planned, Ere those bright stores be gathered and acquired, By all so justly prized, so much admired! Behold how bounteously doth it fulfil Each mortal wish with endless kindness stillâ Behold how amply doth it evermore Crown each desire with an unbounded store, Those fond desires which all by nature share, To look on objects beautiful and fair, As though its Mighty Love might ne'er repress The outpourings of its own Divine excess, And while it seemed, resisting to withhold, In truth did all unto his view unfold! As if, in its benignant strength intense, In the overflow of its munificence, It granted more because it part denied, Till man his own resources meetly tried, Aye! in its mercy's ever-swelling tideâ The luxury of its great profusion even! Oh! copious grace of the all-bestowing Heaven! Oh! Prodigality! that nought denies, Oh! lavish bounty of the yielding skies! 'Tis therefore that the charm of ev'n those things O'er which a veil of depth and doubt it flings, Their beauties and their splendours, shine, bestowed On things more common, till Heav'n seems to o'erload With loving-kindness and indulgence deep Those who too oft its blessings thankless reap! Those who too oft with careless scorn receive, Nor to the giftânor to the Giver cleave. Behold! the glories everywhere outspread, Beneath Man's wandering footâabove his head In rich succession exquisite and bright, To arrest the fancy and attract the sight, Fair treasures Heaven doth evermore dispense To charm his yearning soul, and chain his sense! Behold the diamond dewdrops of the morn, Which every leaf and every spray adorn, Myriads and myriad myriadsâtwinkling thick With ceaseless scintillation, clear and quick, Fair as the richest diamonds of the mine, With countless colours they intensely shine, And make the rainbow-earth itself appear One precious jewelâbeautiful and clearâ While each pure drop, ere its brief race be run, Holds up its fairy mirror to the Sun! Behold the painted pageants of the skies, That shine with matchless and with nameless dyes, And win the astonished and enchanted gaze With the Orient splendours of their varied blaze; Look on the flowing stream's gay sparkling floor, With gem-like pebbles richly scattered o'er! A bright Mosaic wrought by Nature's hand, Finely performed as delicately planned; Turn to the immortal Stars in midnight's hour, Upon their glorious march of pride and power, The jewels of Eternity!âwhose light Makes one half darkened Sun of the olden Night, So richly sown with theseâand these so bright! So splendid and so scattered are they seen, (Creations rare with chaos-glooms between,) It seems as though the the charmed eye looked upon The dazzling parts of some divided Sunâ Those mightiest gems beyond all others fair, To all yet open as the general air, The proudest, the most lustrous and divine, For all that yet with liberal splendour shine; The loveliest and the least concealed, are they, Free as the dewâand bounteous as the day! Displayed without reserve at once, to allâ Yet weighed with these, how fade the rest and fall! Behold, the glories o'er the landscape thrown, In rich diversity supremely shown; The more than pomp in which it glows arrayed, The light of boundless loveliness displayed! These are the treasures which we all possessâ These are the gifts that gladden and that bless; Which ask no labourâwhich require no careâ Which all may equally enjoy and share, And these most barren naked cliffs that now So proudly glitterâand so brightly glow; These can be made the Palace dome to outshine, Though decked with spoils from the productive mine It rears its haughty head on high sublime, The work of Art, of Labour, and of Time, These can chain down the dazzled wondering eye, And flame with keenly-kindling brilliancy. Oh! of this glorious Natureâheavenly fairâ All, great Creator! 'tis thy gracious care, 'Tis thy most wonderous workmanship alone Which here we recognizeâto shame our own; Thou dost prevent our wishes, and provide All things we need, and yet how much beside! Thou dost outstrip our thoughtsâsurpass our dreamsâ And pour thy bounty forth in plenteous streams! Yet winn'st us still our strength, our power to try, But for our own more sure Felicity. THE WARRIOR'S CONFESSION. With jewellery of stud and nail, With furniture of stubborn mail, With ornaments of sword and spear, Lo! at thy side, Love! I appear. My wealth's the sabre and the shield, Mine heritage the tented field, My pleasure-ground's the Battle-heath, My patronâFame,âmy playmateâDeath! My brow with frowns lowers black and bent, And tells of years in conflict spent; My voice is rough, as it should be, To shout 'mongst thousands shouting free. My hand is ironâand my arm Right strong to deal the mortal harm; Yet know, fair Love, what none have known, My heart even tender as thine own! BE STILL. Be still-poor heart of mine, Forget to heave and thrill; Unmurmuringly resignâ Bleedâbreakâbut be thou still. Take all thy share of pain, Shrink not from scourge and sting, Nor ever dare complain, 'Twill but fresh sufferings bring. Since jealous Fate still seeks For hearts of feeling kind, On which she darkly wreaks Her ruthless fury, blind. Be stillâpoor, poorest heart, In silent suffering rest, Though many a venomed dart Be sheathed within this breast. THE HAUNTS OF SORROW. At the shadowy hour of eventide, When Nature doffs her glaring hues, How sweet for hearts long tired, long tried, Apart and undisturbed to muse. Shades after shades come deepening on, Sound after sound dies soft away, Till glare is goneâtill noise is none, And past and perished is the day. Then how this heart's wild woe subsides, Yet far more freely gush its springs, While halcyon Peace broods o'er its tides With comforting and covering wings. Then from myself I mount, I rise, And try sweet paths untried before; And fly as Expectation flies, To find some new untrodden shore. Each thought seems furnished with a wing, I leave this weary doom behind, And every dark and dismal thing, Which long hath pained my fevered mind. I wander through all haunts beloved, Where holy sorrow soothes to stay; Not all in truth from Earth removed, Yet purified from grosser clay. Not all from Sorrow's yoke set free, But won unto her tenderest mood A grief, yet dearer far than glee, With something soft and sweet imbued. The Past and Present reconciled Might seem to be in that sweet hour, When all is solemn, calm, and mildâ When Memory and the Moon have power. Say, Sorrowâwhere thy chief abode? Lovest thou to haunt the deep sea shore, Or mourn o'er fields where blood hath flowed, Or tread the Desert's shifting floor? Or rovest thou midst Italian bowers, To weep o'er reliques of the Past? Or where the funeral-scenery lowers In Norway's pine woods, dark and vast? Or where old mountain-solitudes Look down upon the World below? Or Nature's face our search eludes, Masked in a mighty robe of snow? Sorrow!âOh, Sorrow! it were vain To seek thy favourite seat to scanâ I know thou reign'st with boundless reign In the Universal Heart of Man! THE FLIGHT OF TIME. Moments pass slowly on, Years fly apace, When shall the wearied One Rest from the Race? Whether we smile or weepâ Time keeps his flightâ Hours, days, may seem to creep, Life speeds like Light! Whether we laugh or groan, Seasons change fast; Oh! what hath ever flown Swift as the Past? What though we chafe and chide, Time holds his pace; No stepâno noiseless stride Doth he retrace! Hastening, still hastening on, None may deem how; But when 'tis fled and goneâ Then seems Time slow? Time, while we chide thy pace, Reckless and proud, Oft doth thy shadowy face Laugh from our shroud! OH! SUN THAT SETS! Oh! Sun that sets! Soft falls thy light Where black regrets Mourn o'er Time's flight. Oh! Sun that sets! Peer the lids throughâ Lids that grief wets As with Death's dew! (Drops big and hot, Drops shed in vain, These can melt not Grief's iron chain!) Lids too long sealed 'Gainst all things brightâ But thou'st revealed Charms for Grief's sight. Something seems there Soothing, to calm Suffering and careâ Shedding down balm! Something there wakes Hearts mute and loneâ Something that takes Sympathy's tone. Oh! Sun that sets! Dear to my sight, Fearsâpangsâregrets Best love thy light! Aye! to crushed hearts, Tortured and torn, Whence Hope departs, Leaving them lorn, Sun! Sun! that sets, Thou must be dear Since to regrets Suffering and fear Morn can but bring Promise of Pain, Many a sharp sting Threatens again! To the World's eye Then seems laid bare All that should fly From its fierce stare! Eve brings instead Promise of Peaceâ Clouds round us spread, Bid the strife cease! Since evermoreâ Prompted by prideâ Sufferings too sore Fain would we hide! Thence still arise Sufferings more dire, Pent, prisoned sighs Turn to keen fire. Tears we restrainâ Ten-fold their smartâ Cankering the brain, Poisoning the heart! Thence springs a strife Deadly and deepâ 'Twere peace and life Dared we but weep! Prideâmortal prideâ Haughty and highâ Thou chain'st the tide, Thou check'st the sigh! Destiny's blow Mutely we bear; Scorning to show Helpless despair. Kiss we the knifeâ Praise we the Painâ Seek we the strifeâ Clasp we the Chain! But 'tis Despair Worse than the worst, Which none may share, Trebly accursed. Stern toil and taskâ Struggling to throw Some likely mask O'er our deep woe! This makes the day Harsh and unblessedâ Night's gracious sway Brings us dear rest! Oh! Sun that sets! Gazing at thee, Grief's slave forgets Pride's slave to be! Soothed and consoled Lies the lulled heartâ Worldâharsh and cold Shut out thou art! Oh! Sun that sets! Fairest to me, Loves, fears, regrets, Still turn to thee! Oh! Sun that sets! Thou seem'st to say, âFate's debt of debts I too must pay! âIt must be mine, Waning to stoopâ Bowed to declineâ Wasting to droop! âLingering to sink, 'Tis my doom yet, Lessening to shrink, Lowering to set!â Oh! Sun that sets! Thy smile appears Fair to regrets Sufferings and tears. Not thus alone Seem'st thou to sayâ When from thy throne Passing away! Yet something more Dost thou unfoldâ When from Heaven's floor Thy state is rolled! Sun! Sun that sets! Thou seem'st to sayâ âFear not Fate's threatsâ Wait the new day!â Oh! Sun that sets! Thou speak'st in Power, âSunrise forgets Sunset's faint hour! âDim now may seem The arch of the skyâ Night like a Dream Yet shall pass by! âEmptied of light Heaven may appearâ Yet soon, Oh! Night! Ends thy career! âMortalâround thee Dark clouds may frownâ Yet light shall be Once more thine own! âBut for awhile Darkness shall lowerâ Day yet shall smileâ Wait the bright hour! âThy Sun divine Canst thou forget? Shall that decline? Say, can that set? âThy soul and mind Are but as rays Scarce yet defined, Caught from that blaze!â Sun! Sun that sets! Hail to thine hourâ Grief then forgets Pain's deadliest power! Oh! Sun that sets! Suffering no more Fevers and frets This heart's wrung core! I AM ALONE. I am alone!âwhilst all I see With something dear in sympathy Is linked like Echo to a tone, I am aloneâI am alone! The Stars a glad Fraternal Band, Like loving comrades, hand in hand, In their beloved and blessed repose Are boundâhow sweetly and how close! The flowers of Spring together smile, Sweet flowersâthat neither watch nor toil, Linked in a breathing coloured chain, Together do they bloom and wane. The clouds that gild or gloom the day, With other clouds appear at play; The breezes sink, the breezes swell, And glad tales to each other tell. The vastâthe smallâthe proudâthe low, Their own sweet bonds rejoicing know; Oh! what but owns a thrilling tie With something dear in sympathy? The dewdrops, sparks of liquid light, By myriads glitteringly unite, And ever on each other throw A soft, reflected, diamond-glow! The mighty mountains, too, are found With their gigantic brethren bound, A crested and colossal chain, They frown upon the peaceful plain. And must I gaze around in grief, To find nor comfort nor reliefâ And look around, above, beyond, With feverish yearningsâvain and fond? I envy thoseâI envy theseâ Mount, cloud, and flowerâStar, dew, and breeze, For me 'tis one drear waste of woes, I envy theseâI envy those! I look aroundâI look aboveâ Ah! there I yet will link my love; Still something whispers to my soulâ There is thy gainâand there thy goal! Yes! Strongly whispers at my heartâ There is thy place, and there thy part; With something dear in sympathy Shall I be linked in yonder sky! IRRESOLUTION. Why should I grieve and mournâ Why weep and wail? Others have braved and borneâ Heart! shalt thou fail? Wilt thou, heart! still remain Sorrow's poor slave, Still hug thy heavy chainâ Dig thine own grave? Still cry, âWould Heaven it were, Would it might be!â Still answerâAh! Despair!â â'Tis not for me!â Wilt thou with questionings fond Tire Time and Fate? Yet evermore respondâ âNo! 'tis too late!â Oh! with more strength contestâ Or wiselier yield; Choose that which seemeth best Choose spear or shield! But not thus vainly turn Front to the foeâ First, calm endurance learn, Then brave the blow! Oh! but with strength resistâ Or but resign! Nor thus in doubt exist, Faint heart of mine! Choose thine own weapons, chooseâ Choose now thy partâ Nor each dear chance refuse, Weak wavering heart! Oh! cease to mourn unblessedâ Cease to repineâ Learn to resistâor restâ Weak heart of mine! THE LITTLE BOAT. It was a heavy night, Storm, darkness, terror reigned; And tossed by Ocean's might A little bark remained. The little bark was frail, The fragile bark was smallâ How might it brave the galeâ And the rough waves' rise and fall? Yet, when the morning broke, Safe on the shore it lay, Safe from the tempest-stroke, And the waves' unpitying play. A mighty Power was near From Ruin's jaws to snatch! A mighty hand to steerâ A mighty eye to watch! Lo! prouder Barks might be Victims of these stern hours, Of the Storm and of the Sea, Of the Darkness and its Powers! Barkâlowly bark and frail, And thou wert thus allowed To bide the infuriate gale, And the billows, tempest-ploughed. Brave vessels, proud and strong, May have been cast away! On their decks the armed throng, And the Warlike guns' array! Barks freighted with such freight As might set chained monarchs free, May have haply found the fate That was thus withheld from thee. Oh! the lowly and the weak May still be saved and spared, While the storms their fury wreak On the powerful and prepared! On Life's dark troubled waves Me, may Heaven deign to spare From its thousand yawning graves Of wrath and of despair! Thus on Life's fiercer Sea, This dark deep Sea of Life, May I delivered be From the wilder Storm and Strife. 'TIS VAIN. 'Tis vainâit is in vain! No moreâ'twill be no more! Now let me force or feign Peace that was mine before! Lostâevery hope is lost, Each dream of joy is dust, All that I cherished most, Most has betrayed my trust! And yet I scarce know all The depth of my despair, At first the blow doth fall With force too keen to bear! Stunned, deadened, scathed, and crushed, At first the Soul remains In hideous silence, hushedâ Bound as in icy chains! Then slowly opens out The prospect of its grief; Nor leaves one dizzy doubt To lend a faint relief. Then comes the mortal strifeâ Life's passion-streams run o'erâ New powers seem lent to life, To make the anguish more! THOU BETTER KNOW'ST. Thou better know'st my love for thee Than I myself can know, I only feel I can but be Thine all, thine own, below! I only feel I was but made To admire and to adore; How can that love be told or weighed, That ever deepeneth moreâ And least of all by those who feel That Passion's power intense; How can they to themselves reveal That all-o'erwhelming Sense? One Dreamâone Feelingâand one Thought Chain, clasp me, and entomb; Thouâthou art allâand I am noughtâ Love doth my life consume! Thou better know'st than I can know My boundless love for thee; Haply, some outward signs may show The inward Idolatry! So much is all within engrossed By deep Devotion's zeal, The feeling's self is almost lost, I scarce can know I feel! Doth faultering word, doth speaking eye, Doth varying brow express, With tear, and blush, and Soul-sent sigh, My Love's unknown excess? And yet such outward signs are weak, And Image but a part, And feebly show, and faintly speak The Homage of the Heart! SPRING. Spring, royal, festal, gracious Spring! Haste thee on thy rainbow wing! Long enough beneath the rule Of gloomy Winter, stream and pool, Grove and garden, flower and tree, Hath lainânow haste and set them free. Dreamy, starry, purple Spring, With the crown and with the wing, With the wand and with the charm, Comeâand thick delights shall swarm! Vernal, sunny, breezy Spring, Thee awaits each beauteous thing, Earth is panting for thy rise Upon the cleared and laughing skies, All her Heart is beating fast With expectance deep and vast, For thy presenceâHeavenly thingâ Rosy, fairy, dewy Spring! Banks are calling unto banks, âWhere are our bright Rainbow Ranks? Our smiling store of buds and bells?â Breeze to breeze the tidings tells, âThere are incense-sighs abroadâ Is sweet Spring upon his road?â Hasteâhaste, Oh! beatific Spring! Thee awaits each precious thing! Earth is longing for thy touch, Earth hath languished long and much; Now set free her banks and bowers From the chains of Wintry hours! Earth thy presence still implores, And in breathless hope adores, Like a royal Bride that waits Beside her City's golden gates, Beside the thronged and shining wall Of her Regal Capital! For the auspicious entry proud Of her Bridegroom pledged and vowed, Coming from some far off Land, To claim her promised, plighted hand, Royal as herself, and high In his youthful Sovereignty! GoldenâGraciousâSunny Spring, Haste thee here on rapid wing! THE RESOURCE. When thou dost leave me lone and lorn, my treasured One and dear, I breathe no plaint I heave no sighâI shed no trickling tear! But on thine Image then I live, mine only, all, and own, And in my veriest heart of hearts enshrine it and enthrone! I build with ever-wakeful care, when thou'rt no longer nigh, A Pyramid of sweet, sweet thoughts to thy loved memory! For Oh! 'tis still as Death were there, when thou, Love, dost depart, So deep a change I find and feel in this devoted heart! THE EXCUSE. Yes! thou must think me waywardâwildâ And weak and helpless as a child! But could'st thouâcould'st thou know How oft, when thou dost wondering chide, And try in vain kind arts oft tried, To soothe and calm my woeâ My mind heaves like some struggling Sea, Where storms career unchecked and freeâ And urge it at their will! Billows 'gainst billows battling there, As though of some dread foe aware, Yet idly wrestling still! Oft, oft, when thou dost gently strive Kind Consolation's balm to give, My thoughts too wildly roll; Conflicting Inspirations meet, With all their powers, the stern and sweet, And toss my very Soul! Then many and many a dream o'erwrought, Swellsâsweeps, and dies upon my Thought, Which words can ne'er detain; And then with pained and panting breath, I seem to share each Dream's rich death, Yet wake to life again! And could'st thou knowâOh! could'st thou know How gladly I would 'scape that woe, And shun that tempest's power; Yet more would'st thou in love essay To bring back to my stormy Day Serenity's sweet hour! REMEMBRANCES. Smiling Skies are o'er us shining, Rose wreathed bowers around us twining, And the Sun of Italy Is flashing through the clear air free, And jocund sounds of peasant mirth Deepen all this joy of Earth! Scents of orange-flowers are streaming, Hues of rose and violet beaming; Where soe'er we dwell or stray, For 'tis the Ausonian May, And all loveliness abounds In these, the fair Earth's Garden-grounds. Gentlest streams are softly welling, Of the Old Times of Story telling, When sweet Water Nymphs serene Disported by each margent greenâ Round the fountain's silvery flow, Where the faint stream-lilies blow. All is beautiful and smiling, Yet not thus this heart beguiling! This most sweet Ausonian May, With its floods of golden Day, Makes me think of Springs more loved, Which my Heart's own Spring approved! DEAR ONE, BUT FORGIVE ME NOW. Dear One, but forgive me now! Forgive this pallid cheek and browâ Well I know thy love should be My Supreme Felicityâ My good, my glory, and my pride, With every hope and dream allied, Well I know it isâbut still At times this restless heart will thrill With troublous feelings, deep and dark, As 'mid wild-tossing waves the bark! But forgive me, Love, and know Ev'n this grief that pains thee so, Even this suffering and distress, And this gloomy restlessness, These shadows, and these clouding cares, The darkness of these drear despairs Spread about my Life's sole Light, Make that shine more richly bright! Oh! the gloom of my fond grief Lends to that a proud relief, Until more and more divine Doth my Life's Love-Light outshine! HOPES AND DREAMS. Hopes and Dreams together leave me! Leave me to Life's dark, deep Truth! Of your dangerous joys bereave me, It were well for me in sooth. Oh! the racking, racking sorrow Of the heart that wakes to know Each bright promise of to-morrow, Never can be kept below. Dreamsâdreamsâdepart e'en now for everâ Or take an ampler flight and scope! Reach these Worlds whence Life doth sever, Where your Goal should be, Bright Hope! A FEW MORE HOURS. A few more hours to Memory and regret, Then for a heavy Sacrifice of Years To the cold cares by which we toil, beset, In this low vale of troubles and of tears! A few more hours unto the heartâthe heart! Then for a life given up to other things, Whence dreams and hopes and memories must depart, Though round them coil the heart's entwining strings! A few more hours to Passion and its pain, Then live-long days to Life's more studied part, Then back to harsh Reality againâ Back to that World which stings, then steels the heart. A few more hours to Feeling and to thee, Then an Eternity of hours to all That is most tedious in monotony, Most wearying in its dull and withering thrall. A few more hours to thought and love and thee, The rest unto the World's cold common claim!â To dull Indifference' icy Slaveryâ Which they, the loveless many, Freedom name! VAIN ASPIRATIONS. Oh! but the misery of this wild, wild woe, I stand here bound unto this Earth below, With every thought far soaring, ever higher, And struggling still yet more and more to aspire! And Oh! it is a misery to remain Still vexed with aspirations fond and vainâ Thus fettered, thus entrammelled, and confined, Despite those quick Thought-lightnings of the Mind! This strong, strong grief! how few can dream or guess Its deep impassioned luxury of Distress; For still it is a noble sorrowâfull Of generous fervoursâand nor cold nor dull! The Mind's Thought-lightnings! how they flash on high, To greet their Sister-Splendours of the Skyâ The mighty glory of each conscious Starâ And leap in ecstacy of life afar! But then a breathâa touchâthey're stricken down, And taught their helpless vanity to own! And Worlds at once are swept from their embrace, Yet on those Worlds shall they not stamp their trace? BEAUTIFUL DREAMS. Beautiful Dreams! Oh! stay, but stay, Why do ye fleet so soon away? My Soul demands ye back again! Will ye not come thenâcome and reign O'er all its energies and powers, Damped in this gloomy world of ours? And only in their strength unbound, When ye are girding it around, When ye are lifting from its sense The weight of mortal hours' suspense! All shapes of Beauty and Delight Crowd round your path, like Stars round night! Dreamsâdreams come back again to me, Or take my Soul away with ye! It is in your enchanted hour The Mind hath supernatural power, Raised high above our mortal doom, Unconsciously we then become Creatorsâfull of power and mightâ Of Worlds on Worldsâthat roll in lightâ And make a Universe apartâ Though soon these from their orbits start, And dimly wane and faintly shrink, And darkly disappear and sink. Surely ye are sent to us to show Our power is more than we may know, That glory without wane or end Shall yet our Spirit-steps attend! That we shall yet claim for our own Things lofty, wond'rous, and unknown! Dreamsâdreams come back again to me, Or bear my Soul far hence with ye! AWAYâAWAY. Awayâaway, the sun shines bright, The Air's a Paradise of Light. Away, and to the water's side, Where the lilies each a bride, In beauty, purity, and state, Shine with gentle joy elate. Let us, let us now repair, For Spring and joy are smiling there, Where the water-chimes ring out Sweet as distant cuckoo's shout; As turtle-dove's delicious moanâ That entrancing, touching tone; Where the shadows shift and play O'er the waters and away; Where some bird on happy wing, Darteth like a spirit thing Through the chrystal sparkling air, As it would be every where. Oh! away, away, this day Is Spring's and sunny Joysâaway! TO THE DEPARTED. Mount to thy mansion on high! Though we mourn thy lost smile on our earth, Would we snatch thy bright soul from the Sky To this dark world's distraction and dearth? From the earth and its shadows arise! On the wings of thy rapture ascend, While crowned spirits stoop down from the Skies, The path of thy pomp to attend! In Heaven is a bright seraph born! Whose nativity angels shall bless, Shall we dare then to murmur and mourn, And wish thy great happiness less? Methinks a proud strain I can hear, On the stream of its transports is borne, A name ever hallowed and dear, 'Tis an angel's sublime natal morn! The winged choirs pour a glad mighty voice, Mountâmount to thy mansion on high! The Heavens, and their high Powers rejoice When a seraph the more treads the Sky! Mount to thy mansion on high, Thy birth we will celebrate here, And love thee yet more in the Sky Than when thou wert bound to our sphere. SONNET. Some few sweet bird-notes pierce the awakening air, And little flow'rets delicately meek Begin the ground to enamel and to streak, And for thine advent Spring! all things prepare. But slow thou comest!âMay, the royally fair, Is near:âbut must these chill gales fan her cheek, And o'er her gracious forehead rudely break? Haste! thou sweet Spring! or thou wilt miss thy share Of the great glorious yearâwhere dost delay? In the fair realms beyond the folding cloud? Beyond the veiling firmament's vast sway, Where Death is not the imperious Lord avowed, Even of thy precious things,âfar, far away? Yet come to gladden hearts to Love's rule brightly bowed. LOVE'S INCREASE. I love thee more than ever, Love, With passion far too vast to prove. Since words, since signs, were mockery here, By which men seek to make appear Their feelingsâthat are mockeries all, Compared with my love's mightiest thrall; Oh! but this fearful depth of feeling Seems self from self too surely stealing! I love thee more than ever, Love! Hope, life, myselfâthyself above! Still doth thy present self appear Even than thy past self far more dear! Ever I love thee more than ever, Though to love less be mine endeavour! I love thee more than ever, Love, Myself and e'en thyself above! Since daily grows thy glorious sway, Thou wert not loved thus yesterday; To-morrow dearer still than ever,â But can this be, Ah!ânever!ânever! TO THE SKYLARK. Sweet bird! how hast thou changed thy thrilling note Since first I heard it in the blue air float; 'Twas gay, but now, alas! it is not gay, It seems like my poor broken heart to say âAllâall is changed, or dead, or crushed, or lost,â Like my poor heart?âOh! that hath darkly crost With its own sadness thy sweet joyous strain, Never may it be gay or blest again! Of old it sung as glad a song as thine, Nor feared Hope's disappointment and decline; But now betrayed, abandoned, and bereft, It hath no note of buoyant gladness left; And wheresoe'er it meets with joyâyoung joy, And hope, winged hope, its heavy sighs destroy The harmonious charm, with Sorrow's worst alloy; It will not share, it will not see delight, And, Oh! it hath a power, a fatal might That makes all glad and joyful things appear Unto itself, as its own fortunes, drear. It will not feel, it will not find content, Too skilled to turn all mirth and merriment To bale, and bitterness, and secret pain, And chain Creation with its own harsh chain. 'Twill not endure, nor yet encourage hope, But still condemns all things alike to droopâ It will not breathe, nor will it bear, that voice Which saith, though Skylark! with thy note, âRejoice!â COME TO ME, LITTLE CHILD. Come to me, mine own little child! Thy mother's heart with grief is wild, And oft hast thou that grief beguiled, Come to me, little child. That sweet sweet brow all undefiled, Purer than snow on hill-tops piled; It smiles on me as one once smiled, Come to me, little child! How smooth that brow, that smile how mild, Shall peace e'er be from thence exiled? Nay!âbe this last joy undespoiled, Come to me, little child! Within thy soul, unstained, unsoiled, Be Heavenward thoughts enthroned and aisled, This world with Faith's own beams to gild, Come to me, little child! Fear not, though frowned on and reviled, Thou may'st be pure, in mockery styled, Stars gleam, because 'mid dark depths isled, Come to me, little child! I CLAIM NOT CONSTANCY FROM THEE. I claim not constancy from thee, Changeâbut change back again to me! I will permit that heart to rove, So that none other keep its love! And though my heart thou may'st resign, 'Twill still remain as deeply thine; It must not murmur, may not mourn, Resign, but Oh! again return! I ne'er will try thy truth to prove, I ne'er will claim nor chain thy love; I dare not hope for faith from thee, Change then, but change again to me! My heart still dreads as its worst doom That thou should'st fixed in faith become; Since, Oh! if thou could'st constant be, I know 'twould never be to me! But Ah! the fear is very vain, Nought can thy wandering fancy chain; Like Hope itself's thy bright career, That Heavenly thing hath no home here! Too far art thou thyself removed From all that thou hast ever loved! Tooâtoo superior still to all That holds or held thee in faint thrall! Still ever seekingâever bent To find some Virtue eminent; Something that may be worthy thee, And that on earth can never be! Then dearestâif thou wilt resign This deep devoted heart of mineâ Resignâbut not for evermore; Return, its life-pulse to restore! Yesâyes forsake me and forget, No word shall breathe of my regret; I pray but this, in my disgrace, Yet once again thy steps retrace! Or be each tie between us rent, Rack me, and mock me, and torment; By every bitter pang undone, Still let me keep one hopeâbut one! The hope that thou may'st yet once more Return to her thou lov'dst before; Then dearestâmove unchained and free, Changeâbut change back again to me! I feel, my best beloved, I know That it shall be even thus below; And I forgive the inconstancy That yet may win thee back to me. Since still beyond all things I dread That thou should'st faithful prove instead; For Oh! if thou could'st constant be, I know 'twould never be to me! Too whelming is my love's excess In its absorbing anxiousness; Too restless in its feverish strife, Withering the energies of life! Too fond is mine idolatry, I scarce can breathe when thou art by; I faintâI droopâI die away, O'ertaken with a sweet dismay. And well may this deep love's excess Smite thee with very weariness; This over passionate love's extreme Haunt thee like some unquiet dream. And yet perchance when we're apart, Thou'lt miss this homage of the heart; A dear remorse shall soften thee, And thou wilt change again to me. Belovedâthou art as free as air, Oh! mind not me nor my despair; Leave me to that one hopeâbut one, Yet all enlightening like the sun! I would not, for all worlds that are, Thy lightest dreams or fancies mar; I could not thy least wish oppose, Noârather welcome Fate's worst woes! Be if thou wilt, inconstant then, But be so for my sake again; Pursue thy winding path at will, Let me at least be constant still! Far more I dread that deeper changeâ That thou should'st cease to rove and range; Since Oh! if thou could'st constant be, I know 'twould never be to me! Be ever just as now thou art, For still forewarns this prophet-heartâ If unto one thou true could'st be, I knowâI know 'twould ne'er be me! Ev'n as thou art then, Love remain, I will endure the jealous pain; Remembering, could'st thou constant be, Neverâ'twould never be to me! No constancy from thee I claim, Fear not that I could chide or blame, Though thou abandon and desert Earth's faithfullest and fondest heart! Uncheckedâunchainedâunchidden move, Thou idol of my changeless love! Still free, as winds and waves are free, Changeâbut change back again to me! BLACK HAGGARD, A TRAINED HAWK. Mountâmount, Black Haggardâsoar away, And rise above thy shrieking prey, The food-disgorging, fluttering heron Which vainly seeks to 'scapeâto turn; Lo! the Black Haggard's fiery eye Hath marked that proud form in the sky; Let the eagle look for the Orient Sun, Black Haggard's glance is fixed upon That living mark which charms his sight, From all the blaze of sunny lightâ His living prey, his conscious prize, That self-steered ship of the arching skies; He seems by that keen glance to arrest The noble birdâby fear possessed! Mountâmount, Black Haggardâsoar away, And seize upon thy stately prey! Ha! how he lightens up the sky, Lessening upon the uplifted eyeâ As though a sudden storm was sent From earth unto the firmament; Braveâbrave Black Haggardâmount and soar, Thou'st played the conqueror's part before, And if proud courage be not vain, Thou'lt play that conqueror's part again. Right gallant, and undaunted thing, Thou lightning Eyeâthou tempest Wing! 'Tis sight and flight effect thy sway, Mountâmount, Black Haggard!âsoar away! TO THE WIND. Wind that sweep'st 'mongst leaves and boughs, How the heart thy power avows, Thou appear'st with them at play; But the triumphs of thy sway Are o'er the throbbing human heart, Where deep thoughts come, dwell, depart, As thou rushest on thy path, Now in glee and now in wrath, As thou deepenest nowânow diest, As thou shoutest nowânow sighest, What, Oh! Wind! can be thy spell The quick heart to stir or quell? Oh! the spell is all its own, 'Tis influenced by itself alone. Evermore at watch it seems To mould all Nature to its dreams! Evermore at watch within Its own deep shrine, for things akin To its own feelings, or its fate, Which 'twill discover or create! All things doth it thus convert (The deep mysterious Human Heart) To its own tone and temper stillâ And to its own strong voice doth thrill! Windâthou takest from thence thy power To move it in some thoughtful hour. Thence, wild Wind, and only thence, Dost thou win thine Influence! A SPRING EVENING. It is a golden dreamy Eve of Spring, And shelter-seeking birds are on the wing, And from mine opened window I can see The churchyard graves, by glad rays streaming free, Lit brightly from the broad red setting Sun, Who ends in glory as he first begun. These gloomy graves his beams are vain to cheer, Those dwellings of the Deadâstill cold and drear, Despite the fervent splendour lavished round Their lone and stern and melancholy bound, It cannot reach the Dead in their drear cave, It cannot strike the chains from Death's thralled slave. But to the Living can this brightness bring Thoughts full of hope, up-buoyed on seraph wing, And win the heart to meditate on all Which must, we know, or soon or late befallâ Nature shrinks not from the all unconscious Dead, And we shrink not, by her example led. This golden dreamy Eveânow troublous Life, Soothed down from its unquiet stir and strife, With gentler pulse and with serener breath, Even meets half way the shadowy TerrorâDeath! Oh! many a sweetly-solemn mystic thing Shall I now learn from theeâSoft Eve of Spring! AND COULD'ST THOU HOLD. And could'st thou hold the dagger to my heart, And watch the life even throb by throb depart, Even pulse by pulse slow perish and decay, And pass, as thy weak love hath passed away? Could'st thou look calm upon my sufferings then, And still inflict the murderous blow again, And gaze upon the fading, failing hue In my cold cheek, which once, beloved One, grew More and more smiling still beneath thine eye, The Star of all my Soul's idolatry? More and more glowing thy loved gaze beneath, As some young rose new-nursed by the sweet breath Of southern breezes, and by opening rays Of Summer's Suns into one crimson blaze? I know thou could'st not! but more cruel 'tis To strike this death-blow to my bosomed blissâ To draw the angry cloud o'er all my hopes, Till sick to death the immortal Spirit droops, That cannot dieâthat cannot cease to feel, But suffers pangs no language can reveal, And feeds upon its tortures evermore, And strengthens, on its sufferings sharp and sore! Oh! 'tis more barbarous, 'tis more heartless far, Thusâthusâe'en smile by smile and star by star To snatch away my hope, my Life of Life, And watch me sinking slow beneath the strife; My peace, my happiness to stab and slay, And gaze unpitying as they die awayâ To murder me in mine own loving heart, And aim the blow at the most feeling part! I AM CONTENTED. I am contented with thy love for meâ Though weak in sooth compared with mine for thee! And yet at times, Love mine, for thine own sake, In thee would I an equal feeling wake. Till thus thou lov'st thou canst notâmay'st not know What mighty joys from mighty feelings flow; The more than mortalâmore than Earthly bliss Which springs alone from such a love as this! I would infect thee with an equal zeal, Teach thee these precious thrills profound to feel, And unto thee, my Soul of Soul! impart These beatific tremblings of the Heart! For Oh! this wond'rous Happiness! 'tis not The cold contentment of a common lot! From the inmost depths of the inmost being brought, With rich unrest and glowing strife 'tis fraught. But nought of self can enter in its dreams, Beyond all Earth's felicity it seems Armed 'gainst all accidents that still attend Our selfish joys, which quickly wane and end. A Heaven within the living Soul it is, Which yet can scarce believe in its own bliss, And bound and girdled by its clayey chain, Can scarce the immeasurable joy contain! I am contented with thy love for me, Though slight, though faint, compared with mine for thee, And solely for thine own more precious weal I fain would teach thee as I feel to feel! Fain would I thus thy dear existence bless With this supreme illustrious Happiness! And only for thine own beloved sake, In thee would I an equal Passion wake! AND IS SHE DEAD? And is she dead? and must we trust To that so hideous hateful tale, Can light and love and air be dust, The Sunbreak coldâthe Rainbow pale? Ah! me, how wonderful a Doom! For now too wonderful it seems! How can the cold dull common tomb, O'ertake a thing all thoughts and dreams? Full many a one hath passed away, And I have sighed, and sighing said, 'Tis dust to dustâand clay to clay, And so farewell unto the Dead! But thouâOh! thou!âwith strange distrust I hear what hated lips repeat, How can Divinity and dust Together for one moment meet? How can the chill and crushing Earth O'er that intense Existence close? Each moment to more kindling birth Thou seem'dst to springâmy broken rose! How can the common general grave Receive a thing so bright and free? How can that mute that frozen cave Be closedâthou Heaven of Life! on thee? STANZAS. (FROM INEZ.) Delirium of Enchantments! 'twas too much That glorious eye to meet, that hand to touch! To drink that voice of music to my Soul, Whose echoes through mine inmost Being stole! Proud luxury of Enchantments! to behold That bright form cast in all Etherial mould, And still to feel the hidden Soul divine Doth even its radiant temple far outshine! Dire poison of Enchantments! this to know, And then to feelâworst dream of mortal woeâ That Fate 'twixt thee and me a gulph hath set, Which makes me mourn that we should ere have met! THE YOUTH OF THE SOUL. Memory! I turn to theeâto thee, Beloved consolerâMemory! And think of those lost lovely years, And not without fast-gushing tears, When in serene and sweet repose My soul within me sprang and rose And soared into the Heavens above, Sustained by Innocence and Love! Nor soared its own glad self alone Above the Sun's triumphal throne, (In those dear days, whose memory, even, Strong consolation oft hath given!) But bore with it unto the Skies Its hopes and trustsâits loves and joys, Its sweet affections and its dreams, Its visions and its cherished schemes, Its darling wishes and beliefs, And allâexcept its little griefs! Bore with it all it loved and knew, (That caught its own Celestial hue)â Familiar and accustomed things, That soared with it on soaring wings; Aye! bore its World with it above, Made strong through faith and strong through love, Bade its own World with it arise, And grow a portion of the skies! LINES. The thronged Inhabitants of these proud Walls Are stillâand still the lately echoing halls, The sounding passages and ringing floorsâ Nor noise is heard of opening, closing doors, No hum of busy tongues accosts the ear, The chilling hush weighs on me like a fear. 'Tis Midnight's deep and calm and awful hour, And the fixed stillness hath a sombre power; Shadows and Night and Silence are around, And each and all are solemn and profound, And one there is amongst the dwellers here, In solitude most heavy and most drear, Though all the Earth's thronged myriads should be there, For him no breath should move the frozen air; He would be still approachless and alone, Though nations round should greet the Silent One! Yes! One there is among the dwellers here, Touched by no hope and shaken with no fear, Moved by no thought and by no will impelled, In Slumber's strictest bonds of slavery held, A very King of Shadows and the Night, And Solitude and Silence! yet no might Attendeth on that Kingâno pomp, no state, No mastery, no prerogative, nor weightâ No vantage, no puissance, and no will, No strength, no policy, no choice, no skill, No counsel, and no influenceâno resource, Senselessâunconscious lies the stiffening Corse! THE HEART'S GUESTS. My Heart! thou art now a dreary aching void! Far hence is all thou lovestâmuch is destroyed And much for ever severedâyet away! What weak wild words was I beguiled to say? The heart it is a delicate thing indeed, And when o'er vanished blessings made to bleed, And emptied of all treasures of delight, Doth it remain a lifeless void, where Night And gloom and breathless Silence sternly rest? Hath it no haunting visitants, no guest? Such blank dull emptiness it ne'er may know. Surely it is notâno! it is not so.â Vacant remains the bird-forsaken nest, The shell of its pearl-treasure dispossessed, The vase whose incense-wealth is scattered far, The channel whose glad streams exhausted are, The hive whose honey stores are stolen away, The mine whose hoards become the spoiler's prey; And lonely too the Temple and forlorn, Whence the idol-figures have been rudely torn, But Oh! the Heartâthe Heartâif emptied so Of its dear treasuresâof its trustful glowâ Of its enchanted hopes and smiling dreamsâ Its darling fancies and its gentle schemesâ Too soon 'tis filled with shapes of sorrow then, Phantoms of buried things that rise again, And brooding bodings, too of future ill That make its melancholy pulses thrill!â And multiply Distractionâtill 'tis bound With countless griefs for which no name is found! A thing too delicate is th' anxious Heart!â And if stern Pain assault it with its dart, And griefs torment it, and regrets pursue, Still rising up in shapes for ever new, If so 'tis emptied of all joy, nor buoyed By one sweet hope, yetâOh! no yawning void, No vacant hollow shell doth it become, But one dark, gloomy, spectre-haunted tomb! ADIEU! Adieu! my light of life, adieu To hope and joy, to love and you, The fatal hour is come at last, And all my peace is with the past! Adieu to thee, a long adieu, Be blest, be happy, but be true! Fair smiles the glad and glowing morn How may its joyous smiles be borne? Alas! that hours thus fresh and fair Should bring the darkness of despair! 'Tis done, 'tis done, and I depart With thee and death within this heart! And must I hear that struggling sigh? And must I view that tearful eye? I feel not now mine own despair; Hear, dearest one! my heart's fond prayer, âTo spare thy gentle bosom painâ Forget meâtill I come again!â TO NAPOLEON IN THE GRAVE. Come forthâthou harsh oppressor, Thou marked and stained transgressor; Be thou the elect redresser, Be thou now the intercessor; So may the dewy olive twine Of pardon and of peace be thine. Thou set'st the dire example To tyrannize and trample, Earth's rulers love such sample, They should yield thee honour ample! Be it thine to make sublime amends, And call thy fellow-creatures Friends! But no, thine hour is over! Thou fiery discord-lover! Who can earth's master-mover I'the dust of death discover? Nowânow the subject and the slave Art thou of the all o'erpowering grave! Could'st thou mark the mighty sorrows Which each fresh fervour borrows From fear of worse to-morrows, While yawn Earth's deep-trenched furrows; Thou might'st lamentâOh! sceptered Dead, The wrongs by thine example spread! For Oh! when wrath's fierce fever Is roused by mad endeavour, It seems to increase for ever, To sink and languishânever; And thou that dreadful impulse gave, So strong to harmâso weak to save! Too soon man's heart embraces With all that stainsâdebases; Too stubborn prove those traces, Which nought but time effaces; So easy 'tis to inflict the wrong Which Heaven alone to expunge is strong! ON DISAPPOINTMENT. Now Disappointment do thy worst and best, Root out, not only from this tortured breast, The love, the unbounded and the o'erwhelming love, But even the power its passionate thrills to prove; But this may not beâFate will grant not this, Nor from my heart her furies thus dismiss!â Oh! I have travelled far, and still have found The gloomy landmarks of my course (whose bound Is that congenial and that pitying grave, Which yet from sufferings and from wrongs shall save,) Were still thine epochsâOh! unbending Power, Who from the infernal realms hath claimed thy dower, Dire Disappointmentâfiend!âthat still loves best To plunge the knife in the most feeling breast! Oh! I have travelled on, unpausing still, From bitter disappointment's venomed illâ To disappointments bitterer yetâand said (Of nought the future had to inflict afraid!) Again and oft againââNow Hope, farewell! No more to me thy Heavenly falsehoods tell; And since within my soul thou'rt mute and dead, Since I no more thy fatal pathways tread, Deadened my life is, darkened is my light, And calm monotony shall set all right!â Thus I have said,âalas! how vainly, still The heart is treacherous to its latest thrill; Since ever have I risen from this fond dream, Only to find thee shape some dearer scheme; Only to find thee wake with keener power, In some unguarded, some defenceless hour; And then again to madden and to mourn O'er dear delusions that can ne'er return! STANZAS. (FROM INEZ, AN UNPUBLISHED POEM.) Allâall now is lost And tiredâtempest tossed: How fain would I lose Life too, could I choose. All, all now is lost, This World seems the Ghost Of the world that once wasâ But this too shall pass! All things are removedâ All I cherished and loved; All of dearest and bestâ Away with the rest! All, all now is lost, Each hope crushed or crossed; And must I remain To feel life is in vain? OH! IF ONCE MORE. Oh! if once more, I might but see Each well known pathâeach long-loved treeâ And feel myself once more at home Beneath the old wood's accustomed gloom! And if once more I might inhale That air which tells to me a tale Of hopes as fresh, and dreams as fair As ev'n itselfâthat chrystal air. And if once more I might but hear The old familiar music dear Of those sweet streamsâso blue, so bright, That gush like floods of liquid lightâ Once more I might become a child In thoughtâand feelingâfree and wildâ My heart a worldâwith visions rife, A vision to itselfâmy Life! I might take up Fate's tangled thread, Where first with fibres black and dread 'Twas mixedâto endanger and enchain, And weave the mystic web again! LINES ON SUNRISE. Oh! how beautiful, how fair The Sunrise showsâthe barren air Is one luxuriant wild of hues, For the crowned Sun unsparing strews His coloured splendours over all, More sumptuous than a royal pallâ With flowery treasures all outspread, Appears the great vault overhead, For many a cloud now burns and glows Like the Summer's richest roseâ And some are like the golden showers Of the bright Laburnum flowers; And some are like the violet, (Though not like that in emerald set)â In days of old mythology A lovelier Flora of the sky Had seemed at this bright moment born, E'en on this glad and glorious morn! So brilliantly o'er Heaven's clear floor Seems scattered now the flowery store. SONG. Bring me a flowerâa lovely flower, To gaze on while I muse; And many a meaning fraught with power Shall I even there peruse. Bright Poetry is writ in fire, Fair Rose! thy leaves alongâ And not the loveliest earthly lyre Can shrine thee in its song. It cannot picture forth the intense And burning glow thou bear'st; And speak unto the kindled sense, With half the might thou shar'st. True wisdom preaches from your leaves, Pure Lilies, fair as dayâ The heart a solemn hint receives From your divine array! A holy and a sweet renown, Blest flowers, 'twas yours to winâ Ye call a regal pomp your own, Ye! that ne'er toil nor spin! Bring me those flowers, that I may think On that dread page which says, They toil notâyet all splendours sink Before their vesture's blaze. Bring me a flower, some lovely flower, To gaze on while I muse! For Nature with her royal dower, These for her crown doth choose. OH! COULD'ST THOU KNOW. Oh! could'st thou know, who never felt The melancholy bliss of tears, Thou'dst die with envy when I melt In floods that bear the wrecks of years. For with that weeping's effort soon Old words, old dreams, old thoughts are stirred, And tides that do not serve the Moon, Heave wildlyânor will be deterred. Dark waves, that long had closed above The wrecks of happiest thoughts and ties, The precious things of stricken love, Then to the surface bid them rise! The Past is all mine own again, And I am Love's and Joy's once more! And I awake alone to pain, When that rich burst of grief is o'er. Oh! could'st thou know or guess how deep The joy of tears can be, though vain, Thou'dst die with envy when I weep, Nor ever wish to smile again! For ere that bliss be made our own, The Soul must half be raised above, Ere that unearthly joy be known, The Heart must thrill with Heavenly love. Then could'st thou, could'st thou dream or know What raptures still these fond tears steep, Thou'dst covet then my cherished woe, And die with envy when I weep! THOU ART NOT HERE. Thou art not hereâthou art not here, And all is desolate and drearâ Allâall that once seemed more than bright Is worse than gloomy in my sight! The Indifferent still these scenes may view, Nor miss one charm, one smiling hue, While they admire these prospects fair, My Soul is sighingââWhereâOh! where?â While they who love not wear away In sweet repose the live-long day, From Morning dawn till dawn againâ My heart still whisperethââWhenâOh! when?â While they in calm contentment move, Which never dwells with suffering love, My Soul still asks, without reply, With feverish yearningsââWhyâOh! why?â THE ESCAPE. As the stream just freed from the iron frost, As the banner free to the proud breeze tossed, As the steed delivered from the yoke, As the slave whose thrall is newly broke, As the hawk, just stripped of the blinding hoot, That soars at once in exulting mood To the azure heights of the glorious sky, With a wing as free as that unbound eye! So feel I nowâthus at length set freeâ Oh! Love! from thy ruthless tyranny! As the bark, that 'scapes from the rush and roar Of a stormy sea to a quiet shore; As a rain-drop loosed from the sweeping cloud, Which some flower's embracing leaves enshroud, As the leaf of the Autumn that drifted far, The sport of the winds in their howling war, And that rests at length in some peaceful place, From the headlong raceâfrom the hurrying chase. E'en so feel I now, thus set free at last From the unrest and strife of the painful past, And solaced, Love, from thy sufferings sore, Which racked and tortured my soul before! Oh! sweet it is when the wild storms cease, And the Elements rest in lovely peace; And happy it is when the strife is done, When the battle thunders no longer stun, When the conflict and all its pangs are o'er, And dried are the crimsoned founts of gore, But sweeter and happier far 'tis still, When the Soul escapes from Love's mortal ill, When at length it wins a serene repose From Passion's stormy and fiery woes, And rests in a stillness the more profound, For its wearying struggles and conflicts, bound In thy fatal yokeâOh! conquering Power! Who seizest that Soul in an evil hour, To vex it with sudden and strange alarms, To turn 'gainst itself all its boasted arms, Its proudest weapons of thought and will, Oh! a sweeter and happier change 'tis still! And I joy, dark Love, with a rapturous joy, That thy power my Soul is strong to destroy, That 'tis girded up to abjure thy sway, And to dash thy chains and thy yoke away. I joy, Oh! Love! to be now set free From thy harsh and thy haughty tyranny! And at once to be through one victory blessed, With boundless freedom and cloudless rest! NO TROPHY-PILE. No trophy-pileâno incense-pyre For thee, thou Soul of light and fire! And shall we see thee sink in dust, And, to its vile embrace entrustâ Ah! not the unfettered deathless mind, But the poor slough it leaves behind! No incense-pyreâno trophy-pile Thou need'st, proud soaring Soul, the while! Earth may forget thee, thou, the exiled, Of other Worlds thou'rt now the child! But she would know thee notâas thou Art glorified and altered now! No trophy-pileâno incense-pyre For thee, winged Soul of light and fire! Creation's the Cathedral-shrine Meet for a Memory like thine. All elementsâall powers that beâ Telling of Heavenâshall talk of thee! THE APPROACH OF SPRING. Queen-Spring, now com'st thou in thy pomp and pride, Ruling thy Vernal Empire far and wide, Beauty and joy come with thee, and thou sweepest In radiant state alongâbut while thou heapest Thy rosy treasures prodigally still, Till laughs the vale and shines the beamy hill, Till wears the wood an hundred tender dyes Of various green, whose fine diversities Perplex the sense, (since Oh! there is no end To those pure tints that exquisitely blend In One Perfectionânot more various shows The Sunset sky when most divine it glows, The Rainbow's archâor diamond's shining frame, Though here 'tis still anotherâand the same!â Variety in Unityâand Change In fairest constancy,âsweet contrast strange!) While joyauncy and splendour and delight Meet everywhere the pleased and flattered sight. Still, warbling fount thou seemest to complainâ Set free from thine enfolding Winter chainâ A tale thou tell'st of sweet and gentle grief To the reflected flow'r and mirrored leaf, And still dost thou a mournful aspect keep, Oh! golden Willowâthat dost bend and weep, With thy long lavish streamers, free and fair, That tremblingly caress the smiling air. And thou, with richest note and tenderest moan, Oh! plaintive ring-dove, mak'st thy sadness known. Nature still keeps for heavy hearts that mourn A gentle sympathyânor doth she turn Away from these in all her state and pride, But yet reserves for them soft tones aside, For them a mild pathetic grace retains, Which best can soothe their pent and bosomed pains. While the glad-hearted can find nought but mirth Through all th' enkindled Sky and gilded Earth, The sorrowful can mark the accordant tone, Whose soft complaints suit ever with their own! TO-MORROW. To-morrow, what art thou? what art thou not? No cloud can dim thy shineâthy smile can blot; Oh! thou art joy and rest, and strength and power, No gloom can o'er thy radiant aspect lower; No frown can darken o'er thy Sunbright-face, Then shall we snatch the prizeâthen gain the race; Then win the victory, and the task achieve, Then all our folliesâall our faults retrieve. Then shall the gladness of our great success With more than mortal thrills of rapture bless, And all shall wear a look of Heaven around, Delight shall have no dampâand bliss no bound! To-morrow! thou art ever all in all, No grief shall then oppressâno wrong befall; Oh! thou art Empireâboundless and immense, And Sovereign gifts of good shalt thou dispense! And thou art Paradise and perfect joy Without the dream of shadow or alloy! Then shall we drain the cup, and cull the wreath, Ours shall be Heaven aboveâand Earth beneath; Then shall our triumph be indeed complete, The Worldâthe World shall worship at our feet! Then shall we gain the most divine repose, And all forget our trials and our woes; Love shall still tend us, knowledge shall exalt, And Peace in all our paths shall smiling halt, Honour shall wait upon us, fortune serve, No more our trust shall ebb, our purpose swerve! To-morrow we shall laugh at thee, vain Past, And reap the harvest of our hopes at last! We shall then land upon the promised shore, Safe from the billow's swellâthe tempest's roarâ Take up in pleasant places our abode, And toil no more in emulation's road, And slippery paths of difficult access, Oft wrung by Disappointment's chill distress. To-morrow!âOh! to-morrow! then indeed Shall we surmount the mound and snatch the meed, And then the wages of our toil receive, And then the web shall we triumphant weave; That webâin painful progress yet more slow Than hers who wept in silent widowed woe In Ithaca's lorn lordless Isle of old, She who the wearying days heart-sickened told, And heavily with true affection mourned, And still to one beloved object turned, Her hands undid the labour of her hands, But by our side some mocking dÃ¦mon stands, Who still makes all our efforts end in nought, And vainly have we struggledâvainly sought, And fruitlessly have watchedâand idly wrought; Some frail thread loosened, loosens then the whole, And aches with hope deferred the sorrowing soul! Discouraged, not deterred, we strive again With fainter heart and with more troubled brain, The same results repeated still to find, Yet still to toil with fond devotion blind. To spin the gossamer, to weave the sands In stable twines, in strong and steadfast bands, Were tasks as easy as to form and frame To something actual, each disturbing dream; To make each dear illusion brightly be A truth, a trust, and a reality! Yet Oh! to-morrow! though to-day destroy, Thy sun shall shine to light us to our joy! Whate'er is hard and difficult to-day, To-morrow shall be but as lightsome play; To-day, we stoop, we sink beneath the weight, To-morrow we shall rise above our fate; Oh! fair to-morrow! what shalt thou not bring, What treasures at our feet shalt thou not fling? To-dayâmuch, much impossible we own, To thee can nought impossible be known! Oh! thou art boundless Good and boundless Power, And Hopes hang on thee as in morning's hour Dewdrops on flowers and leaves, a dazzling crown Which the least touch shall shake too surely down; And so fleet all our radiant hopes away, When bright to-morrow hath become to-day; It ever proves too painfully the same,â Ever its nature changing with its name! HOPELESSNESS. Is there to these wild griefs no end? Shall Time not comfort and befriend? Must these unbreathed, embosomed woes Find neither limit nor repose? No bound nor peace shall these e'er find, These torture-tempests of the mind, Till Passion or its prey are past The limits of their life at last, Till Passion or its prey succumb Still must I sufferâstill the sum Of my dark sorrows seek to increase, As though the excess of pain brought peace! Alas! 'tis falseâit is not soâ We deaden not the sense of woe By still imposing Cares on Caresâ Heaping Despairs upon Despairs! The Heart is capable of All! 'Twill farther still, and farther fall! And deeper drain, and deeper still, The poisoned draughtsâthe dregs of Ill! YES! I CAN SMILE! Yes! I can smileâand almost learn To smile without a pang of pain, And hear gay words, and ev'n return Words careless, light, and gay again! And I can almost cloak and hide The sufferings that I cannot check, Yet not from scorn, and not from pride, Still should the Sea conceal the Wreck. I pray for pity now no more, Nor shrink from Scrutiny's cold gaze, Whatever may have moved before, Nought now can shake my silent days. I do not wishâI do not fear, But rest in stern and stagnant peace, Nay! when I shed grief's bitterest tear I do not pray that pang should cease. And yet, even in this frozen mood, As in Excitement's stormiest hour, Love, uncontrolled and unsubdued, Sways o'er my Soul with boundless power! TO THE COUNTESS OF JERSEY, ON HER REVISITING BELVOIR CASTLE AFTER A LONG ABSENCE Thou bad'st me touch the chorded shell, Thou bad'st the breathing numbers swell, And I that mandate had obeyed, Or unreluctantly essayed, But that with fascinated look Mine eye had wandered through thy book, To find 'mongst its enchanted pages Namesâthat still shine the stars of ages, There have I read the magic strains Of him who o'er young fancy reigns Thomas Moore, Esq.â She, that his high behest fulfills, And yields whate'er he asks and wills; And all her gifts o'er him are shed, Through all her paths 'tis his to tread, Her Fairy Kingdoms spread before him, For him to enrich them and to explore them! Her treasures opened to his view, For him to exhaust themâand renew! Heâwhose divine imagination Hath, Ariel-like, searched through Creation! And borne away its precious things, Meet freight for those Etherial wings! Meet tribute too, for such a shrine, Oh! crowned with many Gifts!âas thine! Nor yetâhis strains alone were thereâ Traced on thy pages pure and fairâ The pages of thy precious book, O'er which with charmed and raptured look Mine eye had wandered or reposed, Where endless beauties shone disclosed.â Other proud children of the Lyre Had called up all their minstrel fireâ Collected all their fancy's rays To light those leaves with fitting lays! Could I then with ambitious aim, To kindle Inspiration's flameâ Too rashly and too boldly seek In me, alas! but faint and weakâ And all presumptuously pretend With theirs my lowly strains to blend! No! I had thrown aside the lyre Nor dared to attempt nor sought to aspireâ But one bright themeâbut one sweet word Would thrill through each responsive chord! Welcome!âOh! welcome to these walls!â Welcome to mine Ancestral Halls! I might not check the cordial flow Of thoughts that caught sweet Friendship's glow. And let me on thy mind impress One Truth, that needs not Fancy's dressâ (That claimethâchooseth for its own Truth's artless Eloquence alone!â Nor scorn the simple lay I weave, Which only asks thee to believe The lay, that Truth, doth sole inspireâ Which may not ask thee to admire!) Though in this renovated Pile, Which Time forbore not to despoilâ Full many a change thine eye assails, Till faltering Recognition fails, Though scarce a stone remains the same, (Those spared by Time escaped not Flame!) Though altered all things round may seem A clueless maze for Memory's dreamâ The roof that arched above thy head, The halls, that echoed to thy tread, The towers, by stains of centuries dyed, Whose gothic gloom frowned dark in Pride Above the sweet and sunny Valeâ That tells a lovelier lighter taleâ The chambers, by thy presence graced, The terraces, thy light foot traced, The winding corridors, that wore The dim stamp of the days of yoreâ Though these, remembrance all defy, And mock the retrospective eye, Altered, transformed from what they were, With studied toil, and laboured careâ Or varied from their aspect old, By dire occurrence unforetoldâ Even though thus deeply changed may be The wallsâthe hallsâthat welcome theeâ Oh! never doubt, that unestranged The hearts that welcomeâare unchanged! ON A LEAF OF MYRTLE. Sweet leafâthou art a fine and fairy page, Inscribed with lovely lessons deep and sageâ A delicate yet mighty page thou artâ And thy pure lessons sink into the heart; 'Tis to the heart thou mak'st thy soft appeal, And Oh! the truths divine thou dost reveal! Thou, stirred and shaken by each breeze and breath That trembles o'er thy shining parent wreath! That thou should'st such deep truths unfold in power, Thou sentient of each blight, each cloud, each showerâ That thou should'st hoard such knowledge, little leaf, And breathe such mysteriesâvoiceless, still, and chief, That thou should'st teach the restless mind to rest, And consolations full of strength suggest, And bid it from its gloomy musings rise, And light it to divine discoveries! And tenderly reveal and sweetly prove How chastisements are sent in Heavenly love. Thou when uncrushed dost little fragrance shed, But Oh! when bruisedâhow thy rich breathings spread Their exquisite delights refined and rare, Upon the enamoured and enchanted air. Scarce scented when uncrushed! but Oh! when pressed, No perfumes of that fabled PhÅnix' nest, Which sinks midst odorous flames and balmy light With more delicious zest the sense could smite! Ye and the PhÅnix, in expiring give The precious wealth ye hoard while yet ye live. Sweet leaf! when harshly rough rude hands assail, What incense-breathings dost thou not exhale! What oderiferous treasure in thee liesâ How redolent thy rich and fragrant sighsâ What wealth ambrosial hast thou not amassed, Full long secreted and imprisoned fastâ Thusâthus our hearts in stern affliction's hour Give out unto that grasp of iron power Deep treasures, undisplayedâunknown before, Long nursed and hidden in their inmost core. Thus our own Minds, by dark misfortune ground, And crushed and aching with the recent wound, And wrung and sorely injured and oppressed, Glow with Golcondas we had never guessed! Mines of pure wealth unopened to the dayâ Then sparkle forth, their barriers reft away. Yes! 'tis the mighty power of strong distress That makes us know what riches we possess. Curse not the active miner, SorrowâNo! Deep benefits from her stern service flow! 'Tis hers within the pierced and stricken Mind Veins of inestimable price to find!â And these to open out and to displayâ Spread to the Sunâand dragged into the day! Fair leaf of Myrtleâpure and perfect pageâ Wherein we read great Nature's lessons sageâ Sweet is the comfort that 'tis thine to impart Unto this suffering Mindâthis stricken heart! So shall they yield, if Heaven allow and aid, Beneath the pressure and the burden laid, Virtue's own living incenseâthat before Seemed hid and choaked within their depth and core, Taught by Adversity to ache and bleed, So be their buried stores of sweetness freed!â So may they tenderly, thus tried exhale Breathings most precious on Life's stormy gale. Fair leaf of Myrtle, thou art written o'er With touching truths and love-awakening lore, Where'er deep Nature's Manuscripts we find, There we glean hints that light and lift the Mind! And where, Oh! where is there on Earth that spot Where the observant eye shall mark them not? On the rude rock that spurns back Ocean's rage, As on this delicate and verdant page, Her wond'rous charactery we recognizeâ And meekly trace, if we indeed are wise!â The block of Granite and the blade of grass, The dewdrop's diamond and the mountain's mass, The film of cobweb and the fleece of cloud, All, all urge things 'twere well that all avowedâ The sweet breath of the Southâthe Sun's bright beam, The hurry of the tempest's phrenzy-dream, The flake of snowâthe quivering spark of fire, The spar's lit surface and the shell's wreathed spire, The globe of dazzling disk, the grain of dust, All tell of truths 'twere madness to mistrust! All to the meek and watchful mind convey Deep lessons, meet to guide it on its way; All can some wealth of Wisdom's truth conferâ Impart some knowledgeâfree from blot or slur. On the pure pages of Great Nature's book Angels may fix undimmed their Sun-bright look, Nor evil there nor error may appearâ But All of Nature's truth to Heaven is dear. THE LADYE AND THE WARRIOR. The Ladye by the courser stood, And checked all signs of grief and sorrow, But lessoned to a lofty mood, She cried, âRemember me to-morrow! âRemember me when in the field 'Midst dangers and 'mongst foes thou'rt moving, My prayer shall be a charmed shield, If there is strength in woman's loving! âRemember how my heart will glow With dear reflection of thy glory, How 'twill with rapturous joy o'erflow, Hearkening thy triumph's gallant story.â The Ladye thus with boldness spake, With eye undimmed and brow undaunted, Yet did her heart with anguish ache, Her bosom with fond terrors panted. And changed and clouded grew her mien, Soon as her Warrior-love departed; Of maidens true was she the Queenâ High souledâand Oh! Angelic hearted! That night by pure Madonna's shrine, A wakeful suppliant, saw her kneeling, The lamp that lit the face divineâ A face of death-white was revealing. All deathly pale that brow appeared, Her hair dishevelled, streamed neglected, Where was that lofty mood she shared, Where the bright courage she affected? Woman! 'gainst Nature wilt thou strive For the dear sake of him you cherishâ Nor outward signs of suffering give, While inwardly ye pine and perish! Courageâyour Lover's risks to brave, Must to your Soul be still a strangerâ Of fear and grief you're still the slave, Whene'er to him there threatens danger. Then nobler is such generous show, For his sake of a mood undauntedâ Such seeming victory o'er your woe, Victory unvalued oftâunvaunted! The nightâthe day passed slowly on, No tidings heard she of her loverâ The field was nobly fought and won, The trial and the triumph overâ Time passed, and o'er that fearful field The Vulture, bird of darkness, hovered, And yet that form was not revealed, Her lover's corse was not discovered. At length amid the thickest pile Of dead 'twas foundâall stiff and gory, The pale lips wore a stern dark smile, As they'd just caught one ray of glory! Unto the Maid he loved the best They brought that corse with grief and mourning! Oh! meeting joyless and unblessedâ Alas! for that most sad returning! They found her kneeling mute and stillâ Beside the sacred Altar kneelingâ There sought she for each earthly ill The happiest helpâthe holiest healing. They watched and waited for a while, Bearing the pale corse of her loverâ That burial bandâthat funeral fileâ Till the deep pray'rs were breathed and over! Vainly they waitedâone moved near, And stooping down, with horror startedâ Look on that formâso soft, so dear, Angelic stillâbut broken hearted! She wept and prayed, and praying diedâ A gentle flower by Fate's blast shaken, His Soul's long flight was scarcely tried, Ere by her meek Soul 'twas o'ertaken! LINES ON AN ENAMELLED PARROT IN A GOLDEN CAGE, GIVEN ME BY LADY LONDONDERRY, WITH HER HAIR IN THE CAGE DRAWER. Though the Scarlet Loory of Manmadin For his wings may dazzling Sungifts win, As he bears through the spice-bowers and gum-tree groves The beauteous boy-sovran of smiles and loves, (Those loves as sweet to the young fresh Heart As that honeycomb tipping his deadliest dart, And rosy and radiantly glowing smiles, Wild and warm as the Sun-skies of Indian Isles) This Love-guided Loory though bright it be, My beautiful bird, is not beauteous like thee. Though the hues of Eve's Heavens bepaint his wings, Tho' he bears the young King who hath conquered Kings, Though where'er he moves he bequeathes to the breeze A breath of Celestial Amrita-treesâ Of the Cam?l?ta from Paradise bowersâ Of the mystic wreaths of the starry flowersâ The undying and fadeless flowers divine, Which in beauty of bloom immortal twine Round the pointed darts in his Rider's quiver, Flowersâwhose freshness and fragrance last on for ever! Though thus precious this Love-guided Loory may be, My bird, my fair bird, he must yield to thee! The Loory that beareth Parvati's Son Must yield to my brighter and dearer one! Whose burthen is sweeter than his is even, Tho' he bears the young Love-god of Brahma's Heavenâ The Son of the Lotus-bornâthe Heart's Lord By a myriad vassals obeyed and adoredâ The young God of Love a fair burthen may beâ But my birdâa yet fairer belongeth to thee, For thine is bright Friendship's diviner Powerâ No doubt of the heart, and no dream of the hour, No flash on the waste, and no froth on the wave, (Still a torrent to breastâand a tempest to brave!) As Love's darker mystery for ever must be In a World where the Passions are faithless as freeâ Oh! mine, mine brings a welcome and wealthy freight, Of kind loves, that shall end not in discord and hate, Of Friendship's calm feelingsâthe true and the deep, Which unclouded, unchanged their mild fervours shall keep; Of remembrances sweet and affections dear, Say then which doth the loveliest burthen bear?â And the ring of crisped and of shadowy gold, Like the locks of young Goddesses worshipped of old That lies coiled in the drawer of the fairy cage, (For which champions of yore had arisen to wage The tournament's gay and chivalrous warâ While that bright Prize had shone like a glittering Star In the eyes of the combatants gathered from far) That delicate ring of soft sunny hair, So airily fine, and so fairily fair!â What lovelier token could Friendship give To bid gentle thoughts still in absence liveâ What dearer Gift could Affection send, My lovedâmy charmingâmy beautiful Friend? AN AUTUMNAL DAY. No ripple on the wave was thereâno tremour on the leaf, And my heartâmy heart lay still beneath the pressure of its grief, A golden gloom was saddeningly shed out on all around, From the leaves decaying on the boughs, to those upon the ground. For Autumn mellowed then the hoursâshe with the goldbound brows, And the leaves were dying on that groundâdecaying on those boughs; And that deep pathetic Season still accords with Sorrow's reign, Then grief becomes a richer thingâa loftier mysteryâpain! Nature then takes in sympathy a soft and plaintive tone, Our melancholy mirrors back, and mingles with our moan, Her voice of sighs responds to oursâthere broods a great distress O'er all the Earth so beautifulâyet who could wish it less? All images of mournful things assailed my mournful thought, Each leaf a little History of decay and failing brought; I revelled in those mournful thoughts, and revelled in those things, Which seemed with kindred feeling then to thrill my heart's deep strings! Nature! when thus we own thy charm, and when we feel thy sway, Then the selfishness of suffering at least seems ta'en away; Not for ourselves we deem it is we nurse our sleepless care In the sufferings of a suffering World we sympathizing share! When where'er we turn, where'er we move, e'en universally around, A sadness dwells upon the air, the sky, the shadowy groundâ We seem unto a host of griefs to unlock the accordant heart, In the sorrows of the sorrowing Earth we feel we bear our part. ADIEU TO ALL! Adieu to All that once could please and charm, To all that could delight, inspire, and warm, To anxious joys and to delicious cares, To all the rich unrest the quick heart shares! Henceforth Life's fond illusions I resign, Henceforth let calm monotony be mineâ Imagination with her sunbright wings, Hope with her troubled though her honeyed springs, Youth with its rainbows and its Passion-flowers, Love with his meteors wild and thunder-showers, Pleasure with all her roses and their thorns, And all that sweetens Life and that adorns, Are but the sources of the Grief Supreme With whose dark shadows Earth doth ever teem, And all that wakes the heart, but wakes it still To feel pain's bitter pang and torturing thrill, To know the stings of anguish and suspense, The sharp, the keenly-piercing, and intenseâ Then sleep my heartâsleep now and never wake, Forget to bound to thrillâto burn and ache! Oh! let me live in such cold breathless peace, That almost consciousness of life shall cease!â Let me to All breathe such a deep Adieu, That I may even forget that once I knew. Adieu to the ardent visions of the Soul, The rich emotions through its depths that stole, And to the Ethereal tremblings of the heart,â The torture with the transports shall depart! Adieu to all that shook this mind, o'erwrought, And winged too wildly this impatient thought To all the trouble of the strange delight Which stirred my Soulâa tempest in its mightâ Since still my happiness seemed evermore A sea of waves that spurned an Earthly shore, Yet gained no otherâtill these billows wild Back on each other rolledâtogether heaped and piled! WEEP NOT. Weep not mine own Beloved if thou should'st hear Of my heart-broken sigh, my burning tear, Weep notâif others unto thee should tell How this torn heart doth with vain anguish swell. Sorrow, in sooth, is good for all belowâ Pray for me, that I well may use my woe! Pray that this stubborn heart may melt and bend, If thou'rt indeed, Beloved! my Spirit's friend! Sorrow is good for all on Earth, we know! Pray that I well may use my bitter woe, If thou indeed my Soul's true lover artâ The exalted friend of mine immortal part. Love me, Oh! love meâas in the olden time The stern sage loved himselfâwith love sublime, No partial weakness show, no fault forgive, Fit me to die, by teaching me to live! Seek not one pang to soothe, one pain to spare, To cure one canker, or to charm one care. No! love me with a loftier love severe, For the Hereafter's sake esteem me here! O'erlook my present for my future good, And check each impulse of a tenderer mood, Oh! wish me not one trial here the less, Nor strive to comfort me in my distress! But Oh! Beloved! beyond all words to show, While thus thou seem'st to smile upon my woe, Forbear thyself to inflict the slightest pain, Nor give the wound thou could'st not heal again. The wound ev'n thou might's seek in vain to cure, From thee, from thee, could I a slight endure, Or bear from that beloved hand a blow, Or feel 'twas thou that mixed my cup of woe? This were too muchâthis last worst dire despair Were more than Nature and than I could bear; From this extreme of suffering and of ill Let the poor trembler be delivered still! Oh! welcome every grief and pang but thisâ With this compared all other grief were bliss; I knowâI feel no pure no heavenly fruit Could spring from such a dark and deadly root. No! wrung and tortured, maddened and undone, My hopes, my consolations, then were none. A fatal recklessness, a blind despair Were then my heavy and my hopeless share. Beneath thy darkening frown, my troubled brain Would whirl to phrenzy with th' o'erwhelming pain, My stricken mind should be a withered scroll, Alas! a blow from thee would kill my Soul! Let others teach me suffering thenâdo thou Teach me beneath that suffering's yoke to bow; Let others wound with malice and with hate, Do thou exalt my mind above its fate. Let others fill for me the cup of wrath, Do thou point out the straight, but steepy path, Let others wring this heart of constant love, Do thou the dark and gloomy hour improve. Then whatsoe'er my destiny below, In midst of all my mourning and my woe, One current of dear happiness must glide Soft through my darkened Being's troubled tide! THEN AND NOW. Of old I walked glad o'er this beautiful Earth, With an ear that drank in but the sounds of its mirth, With an eye that perceived but the pleasure and pride O'er the fair face of Nature spread freely and wide; With a Soul that but answered each challenge of joy, Nor dreamt of delusion, nor knew of alloyâ I turned from the cloud on the bright ray to gaze, Nay! I saw not those clouds, blotted out by those rays! Nor then heeded the sigh of the wind echoing longâ Ah! I heard not the sighâoverborne by the song! The sweet song of the birds in their freedom and bliss, But that time was the deepest of contrasts to this! Now, the Sun may shine out in crowned splendour and pride, If one faint wreath of cloud be dim-frowning besideâ I mark thatâbut am blind to the Sun heav'nly brightâ Still I dream of the darkness, nor look for the light! Now the birds may exult in as brilliant a strain, If there be a low sound that seems still to complain, Ev'n the slight shivery breath of the shrill moaning breeze Dyingâdying away 'mongst the unechoing trees, That sound is the sound that I hear, full and strong, Since I watch for the wail, and still shrink from the song. Oh! that sound is the sound that o'er me winneth sway, For I mind but the moan, and I list not the lay. Ah! stern is the contrast and sad is the change, And deep is the difference. and startling and strange Of the days that frown now, and the days that smiled then. And must joy and glad hope never shine forth againâ Must I walk o'er this blooming and beautiful Earth, But to turn from its splendour and turn from its mirth, And each cloud to detect, and each shadow to trace, That dwell for a space on its exquisite face? THE WARRIOR'S PETITION. I may not boast of haughty birthâ Yet let me prove my knightly worthâ Ladye! I pray thee let me prove What I can compass for thy love! But promise me thy priceless smile As the proud guerdon of my toil, And let me see that crested Lord Who dares to affront this fiery sword! They talk of spell and mystic charm, The blood to rouse, to nerve the arm; Oh! never yet was charm so deep As that sweet Hope such smile to reap. Ladye! I boast no noble blood, But noble is the undaunted mood That swells the loyal champion's breastâ To that how tame's the Lion-crest! From haughty Peer and Paladin Thy smile and blush I yet will win, From Kaiser crowned and sceptered King The palm will bear, the prize will bring! Since never Paladin nor Peer Hath known to love with love so dear, Since ermined Kingâsince Kaiser proud, Hath ne'er such passion's might avowed. And that hath more than magic charm! The strength of hosts is in this arm, My sword is as a sword of fire, A ravening tempest is mine ire! Speak thou the wordâand forth I go To find in whom I meetâa foe; To challenge nations in thy name, To fight Earth's armies for thy fame! Speak then the word, fair Love of mine, Grant me the pledge, and give the sign, And Chief and sceptered Lord shall prove How vast a power is lent to Love! The iron Rulers of the North, Who sweep like their own storm-blasts forth, The turbanned Kalifs of the East, Who revel in the gory feast, The Captains of chivalrous war, Each, gallant Knighthood's shining star, The Chiefs of savage Cohorts free, Nature's unlaurelled Chivalry. Kalif and Kaiser, King and Chief, Shall yield in conflict fierce and brief, All shall be challenged and defied, All shall be stricken in their pride; All shall confess my warlike claim, All shall be conquered in thy name, Strength, skill, nor numbers shall availâ When I, thy champion pledged, assail! Seems this to be a boast too bold?â No! were it urged a thousand-fold. Not mine the power, not mine the might, But thine the triumphâand the right! When I have bowed an hundred Kings, When with my Fame the wide World rings, When boundless glory is mine own, Then will I make the mystery known. When North and South and East and West My prowess and success attest, When nations own my warrior sway, And my dominion all obeyâ When through the magic of my sword I reign of countless lands the Lord, When Leaders and their Legions yield, And mine's the universal Field, Then will I publish and declare The rightful Victorâbright and fairâ Forth to the enraptured World shall shine Its Sovereign Mistress thenâand mine! Then shall the World its tamer see, And then exultâenslaved by thee! And high and haughty joy confessâ Hailing the Conqueror's Conqueress! (And I shall grow yet prouder, sweet, Flinging my crown wreaths at thy feet, And unto thee transferring all The honours to my share that fall!) Then shall I raise the mask and show The Nations their resistless foeâ The terrible, the stern, the dreadâ Fairest of Forms on Earth that tread! Then shall I lift the veil and show The Rulers their all Heavenly Foe! And they shall glory to resign Their sceptres to such hands as thine! Then Ladye, promise thy rich smile To pay me for my Princely toil, And I will prove thy Champion true, And deedsâthat yet are namelessâdo! And Paladin, and Prince, and Peer Shall envy me in their proud sphere, And ownâwith jealous rancour own That Love commands success alone! And Captain stern, and haughty Chief Shall rage in vain with stormy grief, Until their Victor bright they see, And find their Conqueror, Love! in thee! LIFE'S PEACEFUL HOURS. A soft splendour o'er Earth was full tenderly glowing, Not dazzlingânot deepâbut all mellowed and mild, 'Twas a splendour serene of the Eve's Sky's bestowing, And one ray ev'n the more had that pure charm defiled. With an Echo's still voice seemed the clear fountain falling, Like an Angel's bright shadow the Evening appeared, The Scene and the Season alike were enthralling, No past hour could be mourned, and no future be feared. There are hours in this Lifeâcalm and happy and holy, Which seem all to themselvesâand set sweetly apartâ Free from Memory's fond feverâand Hope's fatal follyâ Like a lovely Eternity lent to the Heart! There are hours in this Life when the Soul seems escaping From the trammels and thraldom it long had endured, When each thought for itself a bright course is out shaping, When each care is forgotten at least, if not cured! And of such was that hour, which too fleetly departed, And left me once more to my pangs and my woes, Oh! when shall peace come to the passionate-hearted, A changeless, a deathless, a real Repose? STANZAS. (FROM INEZ, AN MS. POEM.) Oh! hopeless, helpless, heartless state, Oh! dark intolerable fate, The joy of my whole life become The desperation and the doom! My dearest feelings turned to painâ The consciousness of Life a chainâ The pride, the boast, the end, the aim Become the sentence and the shame. And shall I humbly bear my woe, And kiss the hand that strikes the blow? Yes! for to cease to love thee now Were worse than every ill below. I cling still to that fatal Love 'Midst all the sufferings that I proveâ And while I that impeachâaccuseâ Would not for worlds consent to lose! So fares the wretch whom many a wrong Hath long subduedâand tortured long, Whom Fate hath evermore pursued With Hate's inexorable mood! Still he exclaims 'gainst bitter Lifeâ Its woesâits wretchednessâits strifeâ And still abjuresâand still complainsâ And execrates its crushing pains! But when it seems indeed his doom To sink into the sheltering tomb, How hath he every grief forgot That made him loathe his living lot. Thenâthen how doth he cling and hold To all he spurned and scorned of oldâ With desperate passion cling and cleave To all that he is called to leave! Then, then how lovely seemeth Life, How light its loadâhow sweet its strifeâ How gladly would he empires give A little longer but to live! All that he thought the worst despair Seems then but dear and precious careâ All he abhorred and loathed the most, He would regain at any cost! LifeâLife at any price againâ Life with redoubled grief and pain, With miseries, sufferings, tortures rife, Lifeâstill his Soul's one cry is Life! Even so were I condemned to part With that rich phrenzy of the heart, Its griefs and sorrows should seem nought Compared with the anguish of that thought! Then welcome were its torments all, Welcome the worst that could befall, Welcome allâany thingâbut that Which brought deliverance thus, from Fate! Yes! so, even so, might I lay down My gilded chain, my poisoned crown, I would that Mercy's boon refuse, And Life itself far sooner lose! LifeâLife and all that makes Life dearâ All hopes of future gladness here, All pleasures that the Happiest prove, And hold unto my hopeless Love! Ayeâhence with pleasure, hence with peace, Nor my despair nor love shall ceaseâ For thy sake dear is Love's fond care, And dear, for that Love's sake, Despair! THE DREAMER'S GRAVE. Oh! make ye a Grave for the Fair and the Bright, Whose feelings were raptures, whose thoughts were Heav'n's Light! Who lived a deep Life all of Visions and Dreams, Whose dreams were more pure than the Mountain's pure streams. She is gone to the Land of her hope and her love, And ne'er mounted a Heavenlier Spirit above!â She is risen from amongst us, and never again Shall we hail that fair form we must mourn for in vain! A Grave for this Dreamer of Dreams, bright and young, Be it fair as the scite of the old haunts she sung, Since stilled now that deep burning heart that once beat With a fervour consumingâa passionate heat! Let it be where the brook sings its low song serene, And the wood tints the wave with the tenderest of green, Where fair Nature's repose is unaltered and deep, There the Dreamer of Dreams shall enjoy her last sleep. There the Dreamer of Dreams to Death's cold yoke shall bend, And the long dreamless slumber enjoy to the end; She shall thrill to the kindlings of Fancy no more, Oh! calm is the Grave's lone and echoless shore! The Inspiration hath passed from those chill silent lips, The light of that Spirit hath suffered Eclipseâ But should we do wisely to grieve and regret That the Star of that loveliest of Spirits hath set! No! not free from dim Care's gloomy shadow and stain Was the gentle and gifted One's love-breathing strain, And the Dreamer of Dreams 'mongst her Visions of bliss, While she tracked distant worldsâtraced reflections of this! Then weep not and mourn not, but make ye her grave, Where the light leaves are stirred, and where shines the clear wave, And believe that her Dreams are more rapturous by far In yon plain of the Soul, and yon place of the Star! RESOLUTION. Now, my heart! in the daring of utter Scorn Be fearless and mighty and nobly upborne! And arm thyself now with the fulness of Pride! And breast thou dark Sorrow's o'erflowing tide. Float not down that dark stream like the helpless weed, Nor bend on the gale like the powerless reed, But be like to the Oak, and be like to the rock, Stand the tempest's sweepâstem the torrent's shock! In the daring of utter pride and scorn, My heart! be thou fearless now and upborne! And hurl thou back at insulting Fate Thy strong defianceâuntamed and elate. Shattered thou may'st be but never subdued By the rough collisionâthe contact rudeâ Crushed to the Death but unconquered stillâ And lofty and proud to the latest thrill! Yet Oh! not the weakest of Spirits that bow To each stroke of Fate ever felt as thou, Words were but weak and but vain to show The wildness and depth of thy Love and woe! Stillâstill in the daring of utter Scorn Mighty thou shalt be and proudly upborne, For thyself thou scorn'stâand each tenderer mood By which hearts less soft have been sooner subdued! OH! HOURS OF THE PAST! Oh! hours of the Past, chained together with flowers, And lit on your way by the heavenliest of raysâ Where, where are ye now with your gifts and your powers, Dear hours of departed and exquisite days? Can it be ye are gone and for ever?âno more Must I gladden my Soul with your blameless delights? Ye bright waves! ye have flung on a desolate shore, The heart that once mocked at Fate's blasts and her blights. What mirth and what music were crowning those hours, What glory and gladness still played o'er their path, 'Twas the precipice veiled by Joy's false fairy bowers, And thy meteors Hope! smiled o'er the pitfalls of wrath! Oh! ye hours of delight!âye but woke in my heart All its warmest of feelings, and wildest of powers, All its truth and its loveâthen like dreams to depart, And to leave but the serpent that lurked'mongst the flowers. Yet 'tis well since ye were thus to part and to fly, That ye parted thus swiftly and vanished thus soon, Ere ye taught me to heave yet a bitterer sighâ Ere the Morn's dawning passions had deepened with Noon! THE WILLING VICTIMS. Oh! Sorrows from Love's dark Dominion that flow, Oh! tumults and turmoilsâOh! tempests and trials, While we suffer the bitterest distractions of woeâ And wrath empties o'er us all its fearfullest vials! We pine in a chill bosom-solitude drearâ We sigh and we sadden, we mourn and we maddenâ Our feelings grief-cankered no joy comes to cheerâ Our hearts overladen, no Hope comes to gladden. And still we unceasingly groan and complain, And deprecate ever Love's fatal dominion! While we shrink from his charmâfrom his scourge and his chain, And the sweep of his fieryâhis Hurricane-Pinion! But still who would wish from these evils to escape, And, who from his tyrant would sunder and sever? Oh! Love take thou Sorrow's worst, deadliest shape, But let us still groanâwilling Victims for ever! Who but feels that e'er felt that deep Passion's wild sway, Whate'er be the sufferings stern Fate deals unsparing, Whate'er be the shadows Love throws round their way, Not to Love were yet worseâthan to Love on despairing. NATURE'S GLADNESS. In Nature's joy is something holy still, It seems some mighty mandate to fulfil, And more immediately from Heaven to flow, And still to rise from this dim Earth below! Yea! more immediately to Heaven to rise, Scarce lent ere it returneth to the Skies! There is a sacredness in even her mirth, From Springs so pure it ever takes its birth! How different from our forced festivity, Our ofttimes hollow heartless human glee! The fawn's exulting bound and lightsome play, The bird's glad glancing in the sunny ray, The insects' mazy flight and busy hum, Near which all other sounds of joy seem dumb All have a charm peculiar, and distinct From all, that seems with our rejoicings linkedâ And the most wounded heart on Earth that mourns, Scarce with disgust from that sweet gladness turns, Though Oh! so far beyond all we may share, Who find in every wreath the thorns of Careâ So far beyond the bliss that we may know, Slaves, exiles, prisoners in this World below! Lark! let me bless thee on thy happy flight, And thy rich ostentation of delight! A blameless ostentationânever meant To grieve the wretch unblessed with like content! Thou tell'st the Earth and Heaven that thou art glad, Unconscious that one single thing is sad, To thee all living Nature still must seem Wrapt in one cloudless, one ecstatic dream! Fawn! let me watch thee at thy blithesome play, With eyes and heart the while almost as gay, We feel thy innocent and gentle glee From every shadow, every stain is free; No inborn pang that outward gladness mocks, No truth it shames, and no remembrance shocks; Pure, and even perfect as 'tis pure, it isâ Our childhood dreamt of such a bounding bliss! And Oh! 'tis something, surely something still In this strange life of trouble and of ill To seeâto feel the joys left yet on Earth, 'Midst much of mourning seems there more of mirth! NEVER AGAIN OH! HEART! Never again Oh! Heartâthat once believed, Canst thou thus sweetly, brightly be deceivedâ How once thou feastedst on thy full-blown dream, That dream that swift departed beam by beam, And left thee from its radiant trammels free To Life and Life's abhorred Reality! Small comfort 'tis to me that now I know My fancied joys did from false sources flow. That now I know 'twas but Illusion all, Which I was fain my Happiness to call! What mattered it to me that 't was not true, Since nought beyond the darling cheat I knew, What mattered it to me since I believed, Since I was utterly and all deceived. Oh! let me be again deceived and blest, Force back the Falsehood, and restore the rest! The lost delights reviveâthe dream renew, The false we trust is truer than the trueâ For while it lasts 'tis all indeed our own, Our Soul its elementâour heart its throne! The outward World's cold breath there may not come, The mind enspheres it in a Star-like home. In our existence it existsâderives Its food from our strong fancyâwhile it lives The Life of living soulsâintense, supremeâ And what hath truth to give worth such a Dream? Yes! while it lasts it is ourselvesâand we Must doubt our life ere its Reality! And oh! 'tis real! 'tis truer than the true! Our own Possession and Creation too! But let us wake notâclose the willing eyeâ Dreamâdream and be deceivedâdream onâand die! LIFE'S WORST GRIEF. Heart and Brain Lorn ye areâ Weariest Pain! Worst Despair! Could I break Yoke and chain, Could I wake Hope againâ Could I win Back to sight Dreams akin To Delightâ What were this, What were aught, Bright with bliss To my Thought! There's a grief Dearer far Than Life's chief Blessings are! Heart and mind Deeply know Strangely find Joy in woe! Heart and Brainâ Spurn relief, Court their pain, Love their Grief! Love!âdark word, Thou makest still Each Heart's chord Jar and thrill! Love can sole Thus bestow Bliss in dole, Joy in woe! Love's excess Sole can make Hearts to blessâ While they break. Seems his Care Precious even! His Despair Dear as Heaven! Grief and Gloom, Toil and Tears, Death and Doom, He endears! Therefore Love Thou art still Far above Every ill! Therefore Love Thou'rt Life's worstâ Since we move Self accursed! Since we twine Round our chain, And resign All to pain! Since men spread Coals of fire On their head In self-ire. When o'erpowered By thy might, As they showered Stars of Light! Other grief Seeks redressâ Craves relief 'Mid distress. Worse, far worseâ Love! thou art, Cherished Curseâ Of the Heart! Worshipped Wrongâ Blessed Bane, Stern and strong, Stands thy reign! Giant-Power! Nursed and fed Hour by hour Still by dread. Dread and Doubt, Shame and Strifeâ Close about Love's wild Life! These and things Deadlier yet, Darker springs Of regretâ Fuller sway, Firmlier strength, Fiercer play Lend at length! Ev'n to himâ Earth's crowned Lord, Dark and dim, Fearedâadored! No escape Ours may beâ Every shape Suiteth thee! Gloom and Wrath, Storm and Flame, Still thy path Is the sameâ We wish not To be saved! By our lot Crushedâenslaved. Still we kneel At thy shrine, Who could heal Wounds of thine? Who would seek To be spared? Fond and weak Yield the ensnared. Who would choose To be free? And thus lose Grief and thee! They would call On thee yetâ Would do all But forget!â They would cling Round thee still Fatal thingâ Mortal Ill! More and more They shall bear, Who adore Their Despair! Therefore Love! Foe of Foes, Thou'rt above All our woes! Thou'rt the first Heavenly-miened! Thou'rt the worst Cherub-Fiend! Therefore thou Ev'n 'mongst allâ Griefs that now Men befallâ Stand'st alone First and worst, Deadliest known, Most accursed. Thou, ev'n thou, Sternly art Brand to brow, Hurt to heart. Being's bane, Darkest dole, Fire to Brain, Death to Soul! Worthless Trustâ Wayward aimâ Starâof dust! Springâof flame! Withered Hope, Wasted Hourâ Oh!âto cope With thy Power! Weariest Baneâ Weightiest Careâ Wildest Painâ Worst Despair! HAPPINESS. Happiness! I demand thee back again, Comeâcome, and o'er my Soul and Senses reignâ Not yetâI feel not yet is it too late, Not yet hath Fate, the dark unpitying Fate, Wholly extinguished all my kindling powersâ With the dread weight of these funereal hours; Once more to lift my Soul from this long woe, Thy smile of more than beauty let me know! Thy smile of raptureâLife's divinest Star, Let that bring peace at length, and banish war. I have so much endured, so much despaired, Such sorrows struggled with, such sufferings shared. For me in my lone wretchednessâfor me Seemed nought but Night and Death and Doom to be, My Sun went down indeed while it was day, But I was doomed on darkened Earth to stay! Grief hath devoured my thoughts and, worm-like fed Upon my very heartânot cold nor dead!â But fraught with over-Lifeâtoo keen and wild, For ever was I Passion's truest child.â My world around me into ruins fell, And yet was I condemned therein to dwell, A chaos 'twas of darkness, and of fire, And I was not permitted to expireâ The Heavens to me seemed as a withered scroll, The Earth one blasted wreck from pole to poleâ All Nature but one hideous ruin wide, Dismay and horror frowned on every side, All seemed one vast and yawning grave to be, And yet no sheltering grave yawned there for me! I felt I was but kept, still living there, By the vitality of my despairâ The o'erwhelming Feeling which I writhed beneath, Built up a barrier 'twixt myself and Death, The universal Death, triumphant frowned Where'er I turned my hopeless eyes around; No sign of life nor feeling could I see, And yet there came no Death to gladden me! All Life concentred seemed, in my wrung Soul, And anguish and Despair possessed the whole! All that was Life was misery and despair, And the dark whole fell harshly to my share! But yet, 'tis not too lateâ'tis not too late, Oh! Happiness! for thee to change my fate! In woe, as in stern Winter, dormant lie The germs of bountiful Fertility, Concealed but not destroyedâthe smiling Spring Still calls to life full many a precious thingâ Oh! Happiness!âmy sunny Spring be thou, Come, come and sway my whole Existence now! LINES FROM A MANUSCRIPT POEM. I know not that I love theeâbut I know That joy thy presence isâthine absenceâwoe, That round thee gleams a very Summer-shine Of dreams and hopes and visions half divine, That round thee glows a deep unearthly light Of Phantasy and Inspiration bright; That where thou art all things are beautiful, And where thou art not, dim and dark and dull. That Life seems one rich rapture by thy sideâ An ecstacyâtill then unknown, untried. Away from thee a suffering and a Death, A bitter burthen of unmeaning breathâ Do all feel even as I intensely feel, Do all at one same shrine in homage kneel, And watch for every word and look of thine, And find each look and ev'ry word divine? Do all, when thee awhile they dwell beside, On the sweet stream of thy enchantments glideâ Surrender up their Souls to thy bright sway, And think too short the longest Summer's day, Wherein to do thee homage deep and true, And service loyalâthine unquestioned due? Do all for ever do as I have done, And in thine eyes seek out their only Sun? Ah! yes!âand so methinks it is not love, Since all the same enchanted Feeling prove Love is not universal! can it be The zeal with which all learn to worship thee? I know not that I loveâbut this I know One look from thee is worth all else below! Those deep dark Heavens of Beauty that surprise The Soul with admirationâthose sweet eyes Colour the Earth to me with light and love, As sunshine coloureth the Skies above! Thy voice is music to my Heart's rapt core, A full and perfect music, and yet moreâ It makes all else a music to my Soul, Blest sounds throughout its listening silence rollâ I know not that I loveâbut this I know, All hearts go with you whereso'er you go, I know where'er you dwell where'er you move, The Earth becomes a Paradise of love; That in your radiant presence fair and bright, There lives the life of life the light of light, That your dear smile can this lorn World array With a new beauty of celestial day, That but to hear the whisper of that name Fills all my heart and conscious cheek with flame, And thrills through all my bosom and my brain With pleasure deepening on to deepest pain. I know not that I love theeâsurely not More than all othersâwhose thrice happy lot It isâor hath been, but to look on thee, The climax of all Life's felicity. I know not if I love theeâbut I know That nothing else at least I love below. There is a World, but 'tis alone for me Containedâconcentred in that one word thee! 'Tis thee I see, I feel, and heed alone, Others may own to ThousandsâI to One! And Suns and Planets roll unheeded by Before my fixed and undistracted eye, The spot whereon thou stand'st my World is allâ Or bounded there, where doth thy shadow fall! TRUTH AND FANCY. Passion and Passion's fiery light May sink and set long, long ere Night, And Hope's bright smile, and Fancy's ray Forget their sweet and restless play, But yet enough on Earth remains Still to endear Life's mortal chains. For shadows gently seem unfurled Ev'n of a higher, better Worldâ Loves, Charities, Humanities, All that Man's natural heart should prize, And chastened hopes and tempered fears, The experience and the truth of years, These may be ours, and it is good To share these, and a tutored mood. The vision and the dream are o'er, The dear illusion comes no more, But calm realities there are, Worthy of all our trust and care. The golden mists have cleared away, But shines no golden light in Day? The dews are kissed from leaf and flower, But hath the Sun no sparkling power? Whatever Fancy may have been, Howe'er she lit this mundane scene, Truth hath yet mightier gifts in store, A richer and more varied lore. Oh! never heed what they may say, Who vaunt Imagination's ray Above the Sun of Truth's full lightâ A more than Giant in its might! This world is full of precious things, And every day some new gift brings, If we but keep a watchful eye On the infinite variety! Still opening out before our view Are endless wonders strange and newâ Fancy's sweet world is glad and fair, And many a rich delight is there, But Oh! Reality's is still The work of more consummate skill, Th'impress of a diviner hand Doth admiration there command. Our fairy-phantasies we form Life-like and lovely, fair and warm, And beautiful they are and bright, And full of harmony and light, But weak and worthless they appear, The works of Heavenly wisdom near! When we are tired of that which charmed Our youthful bosoms (waked and warmed By every tint and every touch Ofttimes too deeply and too muchâ That winged Imagination's power Bestoweth in her rainbow-hour) And turn from these delights away To look upon Life's common day! When we (the while we grieve and mourn) To Truth's deep World eternal turnâ Then with soothed heart and gladdened mind, How oft do we astonished find A new World brightening more and more, Of which we ne'er had dreamt before, And kindling out before our gaze, To fill with transport and amaze! Things actual, true, and certain seem, To shame our poor and fragile Dream! The Truth doth Fiction still surpass, As the object the reflecting glassâ The substance the faint shadow cast Behind itâand it is surpassed! Oh! in this world the True the Real Are things that far outstrip th' Ideal! The chain we snap, the spell we break, And thousand sweet discoveries make; Things that till then unmarked have been, Things we have noted notâscarce seen, Take then fresh shapes unto our eyes, And strike with kindlings of surprise. Imagination, like the Moon, But boasts of light, a lavished boon, She borroweth ever, nor doth know The source from whence her riches flow. Truth, like the Sun, immortal shinesâ Within himself, those golden mines That make all wealth, all pomp, all lightâ For ever excellently bright! Oh! but this Worldâthe vast, the wide, At every point, on every side, Beneath, around, apart, aboveâ Is full of loveliness and love! It is a world of precious things, Where future Powers may plume their wings, And teach themselves indeed to be Worthy of Immortality!â Where future Angels well may learn With Heavenly zeal of love to burn! And yet the more we mark and know, The more we find, above, belowâ Perfectionâboundless and sublimeâ Even in this World of Death and Time. Oh! let us walk with watchful eyes, Nor slacken our quick energies, If we would half the wonders learn, And half the splendid truths discern, That everywhere indeed abound Our faultering mortal steps around. CHILDISH MEMORIES. 'Midst Passion's conflicts in our riper years, Amidst its hurricanes of sighs and tears, How ever and anon sweet Memories rise Before our tortured and distracted eyes Of our own smiling childhood, glad and gay, Ere the dear doves of Peace had flown awayâ When all was beautiful with heart-born joy, And we were unconversant with annoy, Like shaken Banners do those Memories sweep, (Torn but amidst the Battle's terrors deep, Shining and glittering)âo'er the gloomy field, Which they, and only they, adorn and gild, And to that darksome stage of fight and drear, They lend a troubled show of brilliant cheer. Fair Banners! droop and cling around your staves, Fierce blows the storm, the battle-tempest ravesâ How may your streaming shreds endure the blastâ And still the angry sky grows more o'ercast, The strife still deepens, and the combat grows, Fired with strong hate foes thickly croud on foesâ The broil still gathers, and the conflict spreads, Trampled in dust must lie those glittering shreds, Their brightness tarnished and their hues effaced, Their lustrous blazonries no longer traced, Their folds of fluttering grace more fiercely rent, Lost in the storm, to which such light they lent. But 'tis not so!âamidst the gathering gloom The thickening horrors of encroaching doomâ The wild confusion of these conflicts rude, The sternest struggles of that hideous feud, The dread collision and the deadly shock That seems Endurance' wearied powers to mock, Those banners, still they brave the stormy blast, They flutter on and glitter to the last! While the proud plume and conquest-claiming crest Are stripped of all their honours, and depressed, And the fierce Battle's marshalled Powers commence To faulter in defiance and defenceâ Those floating banners still their faint gleam lend, And flutter stillâand glitter to the end! LINES. Go! in thy strength and state, Go and be proud and great! While East and West and South and North, Thousands thy name are thundering forth, A little whisper, deep and clear, Yet, yet shall tremble to thine ear! Go in thy Power and Pride With Fortune for thy Bride! Sweep on in strength and state, Go! and be proud and great! Thine still is manhood's noble prime, And far into the future time Appears the promise to extend Of thy fair triumph without end; Go in thy pride and power, Son of a shining hour! Go! and be proud and greatâ Triumphant and elate, For Happiness, indeed, perchance She, she may shun high Fortune's glance, But thou know'st deeply strangely well The force of haughty Power's strong spellâ Go and be proud and great, Go in thy Strength and State Go in thy Power and Prideâ To thee is nought denied! Though Peace of Mind and Happiness May smile not on thy great success, Thou, thou know'st Empire's sovereign worth, And see'st but Thrones and Realms on Earth, Go! and be proud and great, Go! in thy Strength and State! Go! in thy Pride and Powerâ Improve the auspicious hour, Amongst the loftiest of the high, The favourites of the indulgent Sky, Take thou thy place, and act thy part, Thou that the elect and chosen art, Go! in thy Strength and State, Go! and be proud and great! Go! in thy Pride and Power!â I'the van of Greatness towerâ Thy Destiny expects thee now, The circle waits to grasp thy brow, And why should'st thou affect delay? Pause not on thy propitious Day! Proceed in Power and Prideâ Nor turn thou once aside! Go! and be proud and great!â Go! in thy Strength and Stateâ Thy brilliant Fate ev'n now embrace, No haughty step shalt thou retraceâ Who that an end so glorious hath, Ere turns or trembles on his path? Go! in thy Strength and State, Go! and be proud and great! Go! in thy Power and Prideâ Thine own high Doom decideâ The smiling Future is thine own, 'Tis rife with Glory and Renownâ A very courtier unto theeâ Becomes the starred Prosperity! Go in thy Power and Prideâ She moves still at thy side. Go! and be proud and great Go! in thy Strength and State! Bright fruitful Provinces expand, Fair laughs the sweet and sunny Land, One cry peals forthâ'tis still the same, One long resounding cryâthy name! Go! in thy Strength and State, Go! and be proud and great! Go! in thy Pride and Power! The palmy wreathâthe flowerâ The flourished rose of stateâthe shieldâ Where badge Monarchic shines revealedâ The emblazoned symbol and the signâ And seat of Sovereignty are thine. Go! in thy Power and Prideâ The Ruler's World is wide! Go! in thy Pride and Power, Thy Sky knows not to lowerâ It spreads one blazed triumphal arch Of Stars propitious o'er thy march. No shadow o'er thy Fortune frowns, Surely thy heart no shadow ownsâ Go! in thy Power and Prideâ With Wisdom for thy guide! Fail not thy favouring Fateâ Sweep forth in Strength and Stateâ Heed not that whisper low but clear Which yet shall tremble to thine ear, Heed but that voice withinâwithoutâ Which saithâwith thrilling cryâwith shoutâ âSweep on in Strength and Stateâ Go! and be Proud and Great!â THE BELOVED IMAGE. Thine image in my Soul is stamped Deep, deeper with each passing day, By Memory's magic torch-light lamped, Which feeds on that it doth display. Thine image reigns there evermore, In growing, deepening beauty reigns, But it consumes that bosom's core, Which thus conceals it and contains. That life-blood which itself should warm, All to that precious guest is given, Love!âthou'rt a dear but deadly harm, Deadly indeedâbut dear as Heaven! And still in truth, Oh! still my Soul Thy dearer self that image isâ It is my Life'sâmy Feeling's wholeâ My all of Being'sâall of Bliss! LIFE! AS WE STILL. Life! as we still on thy strange pathway move, We leave behind the things we fondliest loveâ Hopes turn to doubts, smiles tremble into tears, And our expectancies grow dark with fears. First our delights and then our comforts part, Then Life what yield'st thou, desert that thou art? Thorns but no roseâno honey but what stingsâ And storms that waft no rainbow on their wings. Life! thou dost darken and dost fade away, Dost lose a charm, a grace, still day by dayâ As though thou would'st a mournful likeness wear, To thy cold shadowy Sister frowning near! TO THE STARS. High and haughty and Monarchic Mysteries!â Crowned with Grandeurs of a God-given Strength!â Oh!âcould Man but read your Heavenly Histories Thus, might Man true Wisdom learn at length! Glorious Stars! how proudly ye invite me Forth to wander, free from gloom and care, With your smile in the opening Heavens to light me While the world seems Shadows all, and Air! But, ye Stars!âtoo much do ye sublimely Speak of other Realmsâaugust and bright, While with sighs prophetic and untimely My sad heart disturbs the lull of Night! Proud, and glorious, and triumphant Wonders!â What have ye with mortal things to do?â Yet, with tones more deep than rolling thunders, Speak your Tongues of Lightâthat pierce us through! Dread, mysterious, and illustrious Strangers!â Scarce can I endure your stately show, Even the view of your proud pomp endangers My quick Soul's unstable peace below! Great, and wonderous, and victorious Splendours!â One by one ye shine, to sway that Soulâ Till, o'erpowered and vanquished, it surrenders All its Thoughts to your profound controul! But, those Thoughts are by your aspect troubled, Ever far too prompt are they to aspire!â Then they quickening spring with strength redoubledâ Stirred and smitten by your looks of fire! Mighty Visitors!âhigh-thronedâfar-beaming!â What have they in common with our Earth? Eachâin his own conquering glory seeming In himselfâstill Heaven's own Heavenliest Birth! Glorious Stars!âwhen first that chain is broken, That dark chain which binds me to the World, Then, shine forthâthen be each ray a token, Each rich beam a banner-scroll unfurled!â Telling all of Victory and of gladness, Lifting from my Thoughts all memories vain Of mine ancient Earth-engendered sadness, Of the anguish of my mortal pain. Yea!âOh! Stars!âeven thenâeven then invite me, Thenâthen, woo me to your flaming pathâ Crown me, raise me, cheer me, then, and light me When mine eyes close on this World of Death! But, nowânowâwhile I dejected wander, 'Tis but grief to gaze on your proud show, Oh! 'tis misery to gaze yearning yonder, Bound and fettered to this Earth below! Glorious Stars!âI shrink thus from your presence, Too disturbing to my fervent Soulâ Till the time its disembodied essence May rejoin yeâand attain its goal! Proud, and sovereign, and victorious Strangers!â Then shall ye illume its wonderous way! Ye, that fixed remainâand yeâfar rangers, Circling round the Eternal Orb of Day! Thenâclear-mirrored in the immortal Spirit, Shall ye shineâwith added glories crowned, Light more pure than yours shall that inherit When it once hath burst its Earthly bound! Dread, Mysterious, and Illustrious Splendours!â Then shall ye be bared to its strong ken, Faint the homage is, which now it rendersâ To your shrinesâbut such 't will not be then! Oh! ye Mysteries of the Heavens above us!â Great, and Glorious, and Harmonious Stars!â Gaze ye not, like Angel-things that love us!â On our wrongsâour sufferingsâand our wars? END OF VOL. I. VOLUME II. THE COMMENCEMENT OF SPRING. 'Tis the first flush of Springânow leafy dells Resound with bird-notesâflourished canticles Swell forth from every golden shining spray That sparkles in the flooding light of day, Earth prides her in her vernal furniture, So delicate and freshly fair and pure, And puts on all her ornaments, as might Some Eastern Bride to charm the astonished sight Of her young Bridegroom, unto whom her face Had ne'er yet been unveiled in virgin grace, As though with that first look at her bright charms She hoped to o'erpower him with love's sweet alarms, To dazzle him with Beauty's magic store, And rivit him to her for evermore! A Paradise unto the eye thou art, Oh! Earth! but what, Oh! what unto the heart? Too oft the whited sepulchreâwhere lies For ever lost, all, all that heart could prize; The tomb of all its hopes laid darkly low, Where they may feel not Spring's returning glow, Earth's Bridegroom comes but they shall greet him not, For Sorrow there is still some desert spot Which it or finds, or makes its gloomy lair, And Spring frowns bleak as barren Winter there! My own poor heart I dare not ask of thee If thy fond hopes destroyed and withered be, I dare not ask of thee, mine own poor heart, If thou pale Sorrow's slave and victim art, Noâthy dark history I would fain conceal Even from myselfânor heed thy sad appealâ Why should I seek the whole extent to know Perchance of an Eternalâhopeless woe? MANUEL TO INEZ. (FROM AN MS. POEM.) My least of feeling is a mighty flood Too strong to be or vanquished or withstood, My Life is as a leaf upon its courseâ And I am still driven on, without resource, By Passion's lightning-terror-shafts o'ertaken, By Feeling's Hurricanes of fervour shaken! My heart in one keen minute feeleth more Than others in a life-time ere yet bore! Its faintest pulse more passionately beats Than those of others in Life's deepest seatsâ Its least of feeling is a raging fever, And what it feelsâunchanged it feels for ever! THE DRAGON FLY. The Dragon Fly Shoots spooming by, No shape is seen Except between Those whirlwind-flights Whose quickness smites The sense with painâ It leaves a train Of pompous hues That do suffuse The chrystal air With kindlings rare!â And seems to oppress With bright excess The sight and brainâ That rich, rich rain Of coloured splendours Till surrenders The aerial thing Its play of wing, And settles near And shines forth clear! That gorgeous lightening, Opening, brighteningâ Then straight is shownâ With shape its ownâ That gem-bright blaze That mocks the gaze, That meteor-show Which dazzleth so, Which seems to be A mystery, A thing unrealâ A guest idealâ While free and fast It flashes past! Then shines displayed, In truth arrayed, In shining vest, Even thus at rest; But paled the fire Of thine attire, And dimmed the glow Of thy proud show; Beside the bright Unearthly light Which mocked the eye When thou went'st by; Thou dazzling thing! On rapid wing, With whirlwind haste In chaseâor chased! Oh! pale and faint The hues that paint That form so fair, When we compare These hues with those Whose startling glows The sight oppressed, The sense distressed With rich delight, When on its flight It darted past, And seemed to cast A rainbow gleamâ A meteor beam Beneath, around, On the air and ground, There then it seemed As past it streamed, A fairy banner In magic manner Waved free and far, With streak and star, With rainbows laced, With sun-lights graced, And still beside Illumed and dyed With splendours such As outstrip much All things that here To sight appearâ All things we know On earth below, All bright things fair In sky and air, All glories born Of eve or morn, Of common day In wonted way, Ev'n splendours drawn From some far dawn Where charmed all And magical Are the ardent rays That meet the gaze; Aye! something more Than e'er before With strange delight Transfixed the sight, Appeared to invest That fairy guestâ As past it flew To vex the view With doubt perplexedâ Amazed and vexedâ Yet gladdened, pleasedâ With rapture seizedâ Then did it seem A thing of Dream, Born of the brain With mystic train! Or of the eye, A phantasy That darting danced Where'er it glanced! Where'er it roved In bright maze moved,â From the Orb's own light Of magic might Brought forth and framedâ (While truth it shamed) Like spectre things Which even thus brings Distemperature To amaze, to allureâ To shift and shoot All still and mute About the path Of one who hath Such mystic dowerâ Creative Power! Oh! vision fairâ Oh! mystery rareâ Most gorgeous thought O'erwooedâo'erwrought, Unearthly Dream, Intense, supreme, Fine Phantasy!â Brought forth by the eye! To charm and draw By certain lawâ The sense from whence It springs intenseâ While far and near It doth careerâ Ev'n such it seemsâ Ev'n so it beams!â While swift and strong It shoots alongâ Beholdâunrolled It doth unfold For evermore Yet fairer store Unto the view Of glories new!â But when 'tis won, To rest upon Some blossomed spray Beside the way, And shines revealed, How doth it yield Each magic charmâ Itself disarm, Itself divest Ev'n thus at rest, Of that which most It had to boastâ Oft its chief source Of witching forceâ Of its best right To attract the sightâ Varietyâ And Mystery! (For nought like these Can touch and please!)â The Dreamâthe Thought Is noneâis noughtâ The charm is crossed, The vision lost, The show in sooth It is a truth! The phantasy Reality! All Nature's own The mystery's shown, Sweet Doubt doth die In Certainty! The wonderous guest From regions blest, From realms afar Of Sun or Star, The aÃ«ry spright On wings of light That Fancy sees As 'twere a breezeâ With form endowed And with a shroud Of splendour clad To make us glad!â Or it might be So fair, so free, A breathing beamâ Existent gleamâ Embodied ray Just snatched from Day!â That fleeting elf That seemed itself In sweet suspense To doubt from whence Its being sprang, And still to hang 'Twixt Earth and Heaven, As though 'twere driven To seek its place In restless chaseâ To find its sphere Both far and near Becometh straight, While yet we wait, With thy charmed eye Expectancy! A living thing That doth but spring From our own Earth, From common birth, No child of light, No aÃ«ry sprightâ No impâno elfâ That seeks itselfâ From far realms sent With fond intentâ To know, to find Its home assignedâ Its placeâits pathâ The course it hath On Earth to run, Beneath the Sun. The fareâthe fate Which must await Its wanderings hereâ Its new career!â Its doom unknownâ Its goal unshownâ Its hidden roadâ Its veiled abodeâ No mystic thing With fairy wingâ But something born Of the Earth we scorn, When thus we brood In dreaming moodâ Of Fancy's power In some sweet hourâ When griefs seem gone, When cares are noneâ (When smiling schemes And sunny dreams Float through the mind, That leaves behind Its fears, its pains, Its galling chains, Its many woes That find repose, Its thoughts that vex And but perplexâ) Even something sprung Earth's bowers among, From dust and clay To fleet away, As soon as aught Of dream or thought, As Sylph or Spright On wings of lightâ From regions far Of Sun or Starâ As Elf or Fay That may not stay As allâas aught By magic brought From worlds remote, That viewless float And run their race In the Azure space Unseenâunknownâ Through ages flown Unknownâunseenâ As they'd ne'er been!â As allâas aught By Fancy caught, To charm awhileâ And gleam and smile With tender glow Round us below!â No thought, no dream, No visioned beam, No Phantasy Can faster fly, Can sooner stray Afarâawayâ Awayâafar From things that areâ Or swiftlier pass Like withered grassâ Like dried up dews, Or faded hues, Or clouds dispersed, Or bubbles burst, Thanâthat fair Form, All quick and warmâ That living thing On active wing, Sentient of all That may befall In its brief life With pleasures rifeâ Impelled along Thus swift and strong, (Though small and slight May seem to sight That fluttering frame)â By some glad aim To it alone Distinctly knownâ Yes! that ere long The swift, the strong Shall fleet away In quick decay, Nor more be found On mortal ground, Nor more appear In beauty hereâ Just glimpsed and gone Like lights that shoneâ A moment's space, With meteor-grace; Then vanished fast, And swiftly passed, Like bloom from fruit, Like shades that shoot From clouds which cross Yon Sun, where toss The billows proud, By tempests ploughed, Like breath-stain slight From mirror bright, Like frozen gems On quivering stems, When Suns shine warm And break their charm, Like aughtâlike all That soon must fall, That soon must fly, Departâor die! And still, alas! (Since we thus pass) Like evermore To those whose store Of treasures dear Should not be here, Whose lasting home Of lengthened doom May not be placed 'Midst Life's bleak waste. Ourselves!âthat gaze On Sunlight's blaze, A little while, And weep and smile And toil and rest, (A Season's guest) And doubt and trust, Then dwell in dust! And close the eye, First dreamâthen dieâ First toil and rest, Then sink oppressed By slumber deep, By changeless sleep, That gives not way To the opening Day, Stern sleep, thrice-sealed, That may not yield Its placeâits turn, (Strict rest and stern) To wakeful hoursâ And conscious powersâ Aye! like to us That vanish thus, That thus are borne From light and morn, That thus are bowed Beneath Death's cloudâ That thus decay And fleet away, And disappear Like dry leaves sere! Like scattered foam From waves that come In thundering might, All wild and white, With rush and roar To the answering shoreâ Like shadows thrown From faint clouds down! Oh! Dragon Fly That shooteth by In fiery haste, As though close chased By foeâfor preyâ Or feereâfor play! That hurrieth past In flashes fast, As lightnings do, When storm-clouds strew Heaven's darkened face And burthen spaceâ Why pause ye near, Why stay ye here? On, onâawayâ Make no delay; Still seem to be, Fair thing and free, A wonder rare, A child of air, A mystery strange, Nor darkly change To something known, And all our own! Pause notâproceed, And be indeed A mystic guest That cannot rest, A troubled sprightâ Whose Life's a flightâ Thus shalt thou seem Some beauteous dream, Thus shalt thou be In journeyings free, A wond'rous thing On untired wing! It shines, it glows, It scorns reposeâ That wond'rous thing That seems to bring Some message fair From upper airâ It floats, it fleets, Returns, retreats, Moves here, moves there, Melts, lost in air. Then back it comes, And roves and roams, Up springs on wings Of fire, still higherâ Or endsâdescends And bendsâand blends With shades and hues That soft suffuse The rainbowed ground Flower-cinctured roundâ Again to rise With its own dyes, Or ere we guess Its sweet recessâ Or ere we spy Its privacy, The chosen spot To which it shot, Where lost it lay, Till up away It darted forth Again from Earthâ Again appeared And gladly steered Its happy course With strengthened forceâ And we remain Unweariedâfain To watch its play! Its mazy way To follow still With earnest willâ Where'er it moveâ With eyes of love We follow close As loath to lose!â With eyes of love Around, above, And earnest will, We follow still Its mazy flightâ And reap delight From watching so That sparkling showâ Till Lo! 'tis goneâ And shines the Sun With feebler ray Since it lent day A richer garb, And seemed to barb Each glittering beam, That Lightning-Dream With coloured flame That hath no name! And more than this We seem to miss, A spirit Light All purely bright, A finer ray Than springs from day, When that is gone Which gleamed and shone With dazzling strife, A Light-a Lifeâ And almost seemed, While thus it beamed, As Life and Light With adverse might Were struggling there, As each would bear The mastery still With conscious willâ The Light, the Life At lovely strife, In beauteous warâ Star battling Star! Oh! Dragon Fly! That shooteth by In fearless glee, Unchecked and free, Would'st thou retain Thy sway, and reign O'er Fancy's powers, Through passing hours, Awayâaway, Oh! shun display, Delay not hereâ Descend not nearâ Disclose not nowâ Divulge not thou Thy form of grace For us to trace With piercing eye Of scrutinyâ With care and art Even part by part, Even fleck by fleck, And speck by speck, Too soonâtoo soon Familiar grownâ We cease to see, Fair thing, in thee Such charms supreme As once did seem To gird thee around, And know no boundâ An insect fair We gaze on there, A beauteous fly We there descry, With colourings bright Revealed to sight In radiant store, And nothing moreâ A living thing With graceful wing, With fine shape rare, With splendours fair, Illumed and dyedâ And nought beside!â Oh! Dragon Fly! Shoot pauseless by, If thou would'st keep That influence deep Which thou hadst gainedâ (The while enchained And rapt and pleased, With wonder seized, We stood and gazed, Transfixed, amazed, At theeâborne past So far and fast!) That influence fine Thou calledst thine, Which thou'st acquired, Oh! much admired!â That gentle sway We joyed to obey, Which thouâunknown Didst make thine own. Hope! thou dost strike My thought as like That Dragon Fly Which darteth byâ Hopeâheavenly thing, While on the wingâ Thou shape of Lightâ Most gorgeous Spright!â Thou impâthou elf, That not thyself May'st know from whence (In rich suspenseâ) Thou first didst spring Mysterious thing, Nor yet may'st know, (Placed here below, A stranger guest That seeks its rest) Where shall be found On mortal ground Thy splendent homeâ Thy sheltering dome.â Worlds sparkle o'er thee, Earth, Heaven before thee Lie shining, smiling, And all beguilingâ Light laughs around thee, No chains have bound thee, Delight shines bright O'er thy free flight, And seems to call Response from all, As sweetâto greet Thy movements fleet! Oh! Hope! no home, No sheltering dome Can thine be here On this mixed sphere! Oh! Hope! no home Thou need'stâthy doom Should ever be Unvaryingly To forward fly, And still to try Bright pathways new, And wander through The boundless air, And still to share Each gentle gale From mount and vale, Each trembling gleam From Sky or stream, Reflecting fair The glories there In that sweet Sky Outspreadâon highâ Each note of mirth That thrills the Earth, Each smile of cheer That sparkleth here, Each dream of bliss That recked of is!â Hopeâhour by hour, From flower to flower, Pursue thy way, Nor deign to stay, Alight not near, Nor thy career Attempt to check, Or dread thy wreck! Hope! child of Light, Pursue thy flight! We deem thee all That we can call Divineâsupremeâ While thou dost seem No mortal thing With Earth-bound wing, But something lent, And sweetly sent From Heavenlier climeâ Sereneâsublimeâ To bless and cheer The wanderers hereâ While thou dost glance Scarce glimpsed perchanceâ Full swiftly by, Winged Phantasy, And seem'st to wear, Supremely fair, Celestial dyes To our charmed eyesâ Celestial stamp!â A living lamp To illuminate Our path of Fate, To shed around, E'en without bound, A dazzling glow Unmatched below, A flying Sun That shall not run In twelve brief hours, With measured powers, Its glorious raceâ Then in its place Leave angry Night To chill and blight, To lower around As chaos frowned, Ere Lightâthy Light, Oh! Sun!âmost bright Burst forth sublime O'er Space and Time! No! Hope divine! Still brighter shine From hour to hour With mightier power But thus to do, Proceed!âpursue Thy onward way Both night and day, Nor e'er descend And deign to blend With Earthly things, For Fancy flings Round thee a charm Soft, quick, and warm, That still seems given Direct from Heavenâ That wins the Soulâ As thence it stole At once away, All faint dismay, All bitterness, And fond distress, All doubt and fear That haunt us here!â A charm of strength To wring at length The drop accursed Of sinsâthe worstâ From out the heart That knows the smart Of grief and pain, And their dark trainâ And worseâthe throe Of that wild woeâ Whose direful source Is harsh remorse, The black drop foul That stained the Soul, That charm had power In happiest hour, In brightest day To wring away. For Hope! sweet guest, Thy sway confessed, Still bright and high Doth purifyâ Doth animate And elevate With joy and love The Soul above Its mortal doom Of dearth and gloom; And while, fair thing, Thou'rt on the wing, Thy glorious aim Still seems the sameâ Thy goal supreme Doth ever seem HeavenâHeavenâto be Triumphantly. But, radiant Hope, When thou dost stoop Upon thy flight From thy proud height, And when thou'rt won To rest upon Some Earth-born thing Where thou dost clingâ As though no more Urged as before, To wander free In strength and glee. When thou seem'st bound On mortal ground To one fixed spot, Progressing notâ When resting near Thou dost appear Disclosed, revealed, No more concealed From the earnest gaze, By the ardent blaze Of Lightning-Light, Which thy swift flight Around thee cast So free and fast. Much dost thou lose Of those rich hues, So Heavenly fair Which thou didst wear In rainbow change On thy wide rangeâ Forbearâbewareâ If thou dost care To reignâto enchain The heart and brain, Nor droop, sweet Hope, Nor deign to stoop, Nor ere descend, Nor downwards tend, For thine own sake Forbear to take A certain shape, Awayâescape From the eager eye That would descry And pierce thy pall, Of Mystery all! Or half thy boast Of Power is lost, Thy mightiest arms, Thy deepest charms Are goneâundoneâ For ever flown! We dreamt we saw With raptured awe A deathless Spright From Realms of light, A messenger To arouseâto stir The Soul's pure fires And best desires To kindle forth Its noblest worth, To exalt, to bless With happiness Which hath not found On Earthly ground A name as yet, Too seldom met, Too rarely known To be our ownâ We dreamt of this In dreams of bliss, Instead we find When marked, defined, Thy form is seen Distinct, I weenâ (And wholly reft Of that which left The excursive thought All fancy-fraught To image more Enchanted store, Of graces there, And build up fair A vision crowned With pomp profound,) A child of Earth Of mortal birthâ A form though fair And bright and rare, Yet framed of dust And ashesâjust As here we see All things to beâ No more we trace Celestial grace Developed there For naught to impairâ No more we view For ever new The light divine That seemed to shine Around that form Fresh, vivid, warmâ Nor more behold The Etherial mould We fondly deemed, While bright it beamed, That radiant guest In truth possessed!â Nor more perceive The while we weave A thousand schemes And varying dreams, The unearthly blaze That brought amaze, Which seemed to dwell, Unutterable, Round that rare thing On fluttering wing, The spell at last Is o'erâis past! We view it nigh And straight espy Each taint of Earth Of natural birth, The stamp it bears, The shape it shares Of mortal things, Nor more it brings Thoughts bright and high When gazed on nigh, The ground-born hue Starts forth to viewâ The ground-spread shade Is there displayedâ We see thee close And thou dost lose Thy power to enchantâ Fair Visitant! While still we own Though much be flown Thou dost possess Deep lovelinessâ And still we trace Full much of grace In that fair form, Though from the worm, The dust, the clay, Still, sooth to say, 'Tis darkly sprung Earth's haunts among, Yet, yet I say Awayâawayâ Forbear, bright Hope! To droop, to stoopâ Bewareâforbearâ Still float in air With buoyant speed, Would'st thou indeed Thy reign maintain, Our Souls enchain, Our fancies fire, Our thoughts inspire, Our hearts delight, Our feelings smite! Far forward shoot, And tempt pursuitâ Nor let us see Who worship thee, How thou'rt allied Like all beside With dross and dust, As still we must When we behold Thy form unfold! Bright Hope! forbear To approach too nearâ When th' object's gained, The end attained, The chase is done, The proud prize won, How soon do men Discover then Its paltry worth, Its wretched dearth!â And sadly find With altered mind The thing they deemed (While rapt they dreamed Of deep delight No change could blight) Of Heavenly birth Belongs to Earth!â The thing they thought Supremely fraught With charms divine That no decline Might ever knowâ Nor change of show Earth's livery wears, Earth's features bearsâ The Child of Change!â Whose widest range Is yet confined (Though like the Wind It seems to be Unchecked and free) To haunts assigned, To spots defined, Which evermore It hovereth o'erâ It wheels around Its measured bound, It soars, it springs On its fair wingsâ As though 'twould rise To yonder skiesâ Yet all the while 'Tis harmless guile, 'Tis doomed to cleave To Earth, nor leave Through lengthened hours Her shadowy bowers, But this is nought If to our thought It seems to be Divinely freeâ Oh! better far Like glittering Star To be thus borne In aÃ«ry scorn Of the humble ground, (Though flowery-crowned And kissed by beams In sudden gleams, With glow and smile It blush the while!) Even though it be But partially In one marked place And measured space To heights assigned, With scope confined, Than to disclose In dull repose Each tingeâeach taint, However faint, Each stainâeach streak That serves to speak Its close-drawn ties, With all that lies The Sun beneath, Condemned to death! Still Hopeâthen floatâ Though not remoteâ Yet far enough For ever off For us to see Rich mystery Around thee thrown Since when our ownâ When once all ours, With thy fair dowers, Shown forthâmade clearâ Too sureâtoo nearâ We turn away And sorrowing say âMy Hope shone far A Morning Star, A thing too fair For mortal airâ But nowâbut now I know not how The enchantment sinks, The triumph shrinks, Th'illusion's pastâ To Truth at last I sorrowing wake And overtake That shape of light Whose glorious flight Appeared to be So wildly freeâ The shape I thought A vision caught From worlds above Of Light and Loveâ 'Tis brightâ'tis fairâ But never there Again shall eye Of mine espy The unearthly grace It joyed to trace In thousand ways In other days, Where moved in light That Vision brightâ That Vision's o'er! 'Tis now no more A Dream of Heaven In pity given, To teach the mind To leave behind Earth's hollow joysâ Poor paltry toysâ Earth's empty scenes To which oft leans The heart unwise, For which it sighs! With vain desire And fatal fireâ 'Tis born of Earth, In common birth With all beside On Earth descried! Its elements While each consents To pale decay, Are dust and clay, Its life a breath, Its havenâDeath!â 'Tis thus we wail And tell the tale Of mortal Hope, When sadly ope Our altered eyes With grieved surprise To Truth at length In all its strength, To fragments fall Our fancies all, Our mood is marred, Our joys are jarred, Our schemes subversed, Our dreams dispersed, Our labours lost, Our counsels crost, Our triumphs tamed, Our sapience shamed, And we are left Of much bereftâ And change comes o'er The Heart's wrung core, We trod on air, And mocked at care, Upbuoyedâinspired, Aroused and fired By rapturous zeal 'Twas bliss to feel! We tread on dust And all mistrust That Happiness Which still grows less; With cares alloyed, With doubts destroyed, With shadows stained, When 'tis attained! Then Hope away, We court thy stay, We wait to catch, We watch to snatch, Uncheckedâuntired The thing desiredâ We onwards press, We glimpse, we guess, We shape, we scheme, We doubt, we dream, We track, we touch, With joy we clutch At length our prizeâ While from our eyes The film doth fall, Which charmed allâ Made things more bright To the earnest sightâ Still let us grope Transcendant Hopeâ Bedazzled, blind, (With willing mind!) By thy rich light Too strangely bright, And onwards press, And glimpse and guess, And braveâand blink!â And snatchâand shrink!â And forge, and frame, And doubt, and dream, And tempt, and try, And strive, and sigh, Nor e'er awake, Nor quite o'ertake The thing desired, By which inspired We forward fly Unweariedlyâ Still onwards press In zeal's excess, And still adore Yet more and more That Vision fair Outshining there, Nor ever find With saddened mind, How little worth On this dark Earth The things we love And most approve, Must seem to be When we can see Those things aright By no false light! No borrowed dyes Then charm our eyes, We view them through A medium true, And sad it is When even our bliss, Possessed, assured, And gained, secured, Can bring a thought With trouble fraught! Oh! Dragon Fly, That hurrieth by In glad content And merriment, Teach me to be As glad, as freeâ Thy sunshine life May know not strife! A little while In Nature's smile 'Tis thine to bask, Thy lightsome task To stray, and play The hours away, Then sets thy Sun, Thy day is done, Thy fate is fixed, And thou art mixed With all things past, Too bright to last!â Fair faded flowers Of broken bowers, Rich clouds that shone, Then melted down To Earth in tears, In by-gone years Bright meteors lostâ A moment's boast!â Sweet leaves decayed That long since made The green wood fair, Free fluttering there, And myriad things On chainless wings, As glad as thou Art surely nowâ Thy little life With transports rife Shall soon in peace Untroubled cease, And thou shalt be A Phantasyâ Aye! thou shalt seem Ev'n so a dream Of memory Fair thing to meâ If ever thought Of thee be brought Unto my brain Indeed again, And sure it shall!â I must recall This lovely hour Of peaceful power, Aye! thoughts shall come, Not thoughts of gloom, But such as soothe With quiet truth The mind's unrest And trouble, best! Thoughts deep and dear Of all that here Proclaim aloud To this World's crowd Of Beings bornâ Oh! not to mourn!â This truth supreme (Which Nature's scheme For ever shows, And proves to those Who still are bent With Soul intent To learn her lore, And deep to store Her counsels pure, And precepts sure, Within the mind With faith entwined) That Truth august Which claims our trust, That Heaven above Doth watch in Love O'er all things hereâ Profoundly dear To him who made And who displayed His glorious might And Power aright, Beyond all thought In making, fraught With excellence, Which proves from whence They take their rise To searching eyes!â Oh! if a fly, But born to die, When some few days Of Summer-blaze Have gaily shone Its path uponâ Can the object prove Of Heavenly Love, As none can doubt Whose thoughts about Such themes I ween 'Midst this mixed scene Have been (if still From jaundiced will Serenely free They brightly be) Ere yet employed Thus unalloyed By errors vile That some beguileâ (And dreams impure That may allure The worldly mind And strike it blind) For those who seek With ardour meek, And tempered fire, And schooled desire, Through Nature's book With care to look Must feel and know That it is soâ Can, can it be Indeed that we That love shall miss And lose that blissâ Profusely round Without a bound Spread, scattered wide On every side? No! the insect may In joyaunce play In the orient beam, And haply seem More blest, more free Awhile than we, But this proud Globe With royal robe Of sunshine drest, And sumptuous vest Of beauteous dye, With canopy Of boundless state, Whose dazzling freight Of Jewels clear, Is sphere on sphere With yon bright Sun, Its loveliest one! With countless things Fair Beauty's springs!â And ornament Magnificent Of vernal pride With emerald dyed, While fruit and flower And foliage shower Their treasures bright Upon the sightâ This was not made (Though thus arrayed With pompous show And dazzling glow, With bloom and light To charm our sight)â To be our home. No! light and bloom And radiant glow And glorious show May chance beguile One little while Man's careful eye Delightfullyâ And gently cheer His sojourn here, But not below We deeply know On mortal ground Can e'er be found Our place of rest!â A passing guest Man is beneath With fleeting breath. This grand Creation No habitation Of lengthened date For his proud state May prove to be Though fair to seeâ A fairer far Where all things are Pure, deathless, bright, And crowned with light That never waneth, But still retaineth Its boundless blaze Of cloudless rays!â Awaiteth himâ While dull and dim With that compared Heaven hath declared Through lips, inspired (Howe'er admired Its glories beâ Still bright to see) This Earth below Of brilliant show Is still, despite That bloom, that light, Which makes it seem One dazzling dreamâ Sufficeth not This radiant spot, This splendid scene For him I ween! His great career May end not hereâ A pilgrim he On Earth must be, His goal not won He journeyeth onâ Nor long he stays, Nor here delaysâ His time is short, The grave's his port. And yet not so, Ah! surely no!â The grave's the gate To which his fate Conducteth him, It frowneth dim, But it shall lead To light indeed! Then let not fear Disturb him here, Nor doubt distress, Nor pain possessâ Beyond the tombs The triumph comes, The truth shall shine, The truth divine! The glory burst Upon him first! When he awakes (And gladly breaks His mortal chain) To Life again, Not such a Life Disturbed with strife, As still in woe He lives belowâ But Life without A grief, a doubt! The dark grave shut On him is but The gate that opes To all his Hopes, Then, then he springs On angel wings To boundless heights, To crowned Delights, To worlds of bliss Unknown in thisâ Immortal man Thy Life's a span, A point in space Thy measured race On mortal groundâ No check, no bound Shalt thou find there Where doth prepare High Heaven thy seat, Justâfair and meet For deathless Powers. 'Mid fadeless bowers A radiant clime Sereneâsublime A waits thee there; Celestial air Shall fan thy brow So darkened now, Immortal hues Shall soft suffuse The scene around With glory crowned, No change shall come, No cloud of doom, To spoil or blight Those worlds of Light; Thou'rt on thy way Still day by day To these far seats, The august retreats Of Spirits blessed, In golden restâ Not here's thy part, Below thou art A stranger still Through grief, through ill, That struggleth on Till rest is wonâ Till strife is stilled And fate fulfilled! Thou art below We own, we know, A Wandererâ A Prisoner! For thralled thou art, With yearning heart That fainâin vainâ Would break the chain, Thou'rt still detained And all constrained One path to tread, Still sped, and led With yielding feet Where thou shalt meet With divers fates, Try various statesâ But still enthralled And barred and walled, Shalt thou remain With yoke and chain! This world so bright O'erflowed with Light, This Regal World Emblazed, empearled With gems resplendent And pomps transcendant Adorned and crowned Above, around With treasures fair And beauties rareâ Incessant change Sublime and strange Of glorious show, Whose living glow May well enchain Both sense and brain! Say, shall it be, Oh! Man, for thee, Thou Lord of Time! The native clime?â Heaven teacheth us It is not thus! This mighty Earth With wealth and worth Of sumless storesâ Whose Seas and Shores Are thronged and teeming Beyond our dreaming With precious things, Whose affluence brings To man delight, And glads his sight! Whose mount and plain With gold and grain Are charged and crowded, While shrined and shrouded They're hidden there, Those stores so fair, Those gifts of good For him endued With excellence That doth dispense Bright gladness roundâ Still perfect found, (Withheld awhile To tempt his toil, To task, to try His energy! To teach, to test His tutored breastâ And call forth all His powers that fall And sink away In dull decay, And by disuse Their vigour loseâ If unemployed Made vain and void By sluggish rest In his sealed breastâ But strengthened, armed, And waked, and warmed, When well applied, And tasked, and tried, And roused, and reared, Called forth, and cheered) This Earth whose field Immense doth yield, All bounteous boons Which fervid noons And dewy primes In divers climes With rich increase That may not cease, Conspire to grant To meet each want, Production fast, Profusion vastâ This Earthâthat wears Through circling years From side to side Fair flowing wide Fertilityâ A garment free, That wrapped around Her form is found For evermore From shore to shore!â The while doth smile O'er coast and isle And continent Of broad extent, Rich Plenty's face Of roseate graceâ This wond'rous Earth With wealth and worth Unknown, untried, Of stores suppliedâ Whate'er may be Its majesty!â Its proud excess Of loveliness, Its rare array And bright display, Its boast, its pride, All flushed and dyed With golden bloom, Which doth assume A hue celestial Though but terrestrial!â While in the Sky Gleams Day's broad eye, All girt and graced And brightly laced With splendours sheenâ A beauteous scene!â This Earth so fair Did Heaven prepare Indeed to be Man's sanctuary?â His lasting home (With Star-gemmed domeâ With flower-paved floor Thick covered o'er With fulgence brightâ Reflected Light!)â Noânoâvain thought!

And but the place For our fallen raceâ Wherein to toil And wash the soil With Sorrow's tears Through rolling yearsâ Condemned they are And banished far From those bright seats, Those fair retreats, Those radiant climes A thousand times More fair, more bright, More full of light, More full of bliss And bloom than thisâ That brightly wait Beyond the gate Of yon dark grave Which yawns to save! Then, Oh! how fair!â Can Fancy dare In glimpsings faint Those scenes to paintâ Can Hope ev'n raise To that dread blaze Her Eagle eyes That court the Skies?â Since those surpass These scenes that glass To pious view Sublimely too Of him who made The Shadow's Shade!

What earnestness Of zeal should press Unpausing on Till nobly won, Those Worlds of Love May brightly prove Those heights may be Eternally! Oh! Dragon Fly! That family Of which thou'rt one, Born of the Sun, May never spring On strengthened wing, With lengthened flight To worlds more bright Than this beneath, Whose bloom and breath Sufficeth ye, Sweet family! Then this below Ye may not know A lovelier clime, Supremeâsublime! No fairer place A waits your race, Oh! Dragon Fly That hurrieth by! Then speed in power From flower to flower, Till light is gone Fly cheerly on! Still stray, and play The day away! Forgetâforget That Sun must set Which lights thee now, For surely thou Hast nought to fear Though night frown drear, Thine aim and bent Are innocentâ And fraught with nought Of thought o'erwrought May be thy breast, Light fairy-guest! Nor Hope nor fear Possess thee here! Enjoyment's truth Is thine in soothâ Unclouded peace In glad increase Still dwells with thee Bright wanderer free! Nor onânor back On thy glad track Look'st thou the while In sunshine's smileâ The Present is Thy time of bliss, To thee alone The Present's shown, PastâFuture hour May have no power On theeâbrave thing, On daring wing! Earth smiles around thee, The Sun hath crowned thee With hues that strike As jewel-like! All Nature still Round thee doth thrill With cloudless joy Without alloy, She overflows Like summer's rose With beauty deep, Which seems to steep The Earth, the Air With sweetness rare! She glowing yields From groves and fields, Vales, streams, and founts, Rocks, heaths, and mounts, Sweet sights, sweet sounds To fresh birth bounds For evermore With richer store Of charms complete Thy path to greet, Thou happy thing Whose life is spring! Then fly afar With nought to mar On this green Earth Thy buoyant mirth, Thy landmarks meet Are flowerets sweetâ These tempt, these light Thy joyous flight Which ev'n to watch Must be to catch Some kindlings dear Of blameless cheer. Thy path still lies Beneath the Skies, Where'er most things Whose beauty brings Unfeigned delight, Invite the sightâ Where'er down pours Her brilliant stores, That wide expandâ Warms Summer's hand Most bounteously, To dye the Sky And Earth and Air With one most fair Transcendant blush Of roseate flushâ From zone to zone Heart-struck and lone Man may, perchance, Urged on, advance In hopes to gain From heavy pain A respite dearâ Still chastened hereâ Or chance to escape From fearful shape Of scorn or shame May be his aim, How oft in vain O'er mainâo'er plainâ O'er mountâo'er marshâ That Presence harsh Pursues him stillâ The dreaded Ill! Whate'er he sees Doth fail to pleaseâ Vainâvainâwhile all Doth still recall That grief of mind Which thus behind, Fond Wretch! he strives To leaveâand drives His bark along, Though gales blow strongâ And goads his steed To fiercer speed To leave behind His Heart and Mind! Himselfâhis Soul!â And bid Seas roll And Mountains rise While forth he fliesâ Misjudging Elf! Betwixt himself And that dread Power Which ne'er its hour Defers or yields!â Which sternly wields Its sceptre wand Of harsh command With mastery dire (Till both expire)â Against I wist The antagonist Who dares to seek Revenge to wreak On That the whileâ Or would beguile Of its dark strength And might at lengthâ That influence dread Which grows instead More stern, more strong By conflict long, And combat keen, Than it had been! That Power thrice armed With Life deep-charmedâ Which bends to noneâ But clings to oneâ Which yields to nought The Power of Thought! King of All Kingsâ It strongly brings A glory bright With perfect light To adorn their crown, Or strikes it down To dust and ashes With Lightning flashesâ Though only they That fatal ray Perceive and feel, Which score of steel Or flaw of flame Makes weak and tame And harmless quite, Beside its blight That seems to fall Unearthly all! The Conqueror's Lord! Whose sceptre sword Is like the brand The Archangel's hand Tremendous grasped (When vainly gaspedâ The Doomed who saw With shrinking awe And stunned amaze In the olden days!) Of withering fire That weapon dire Seems formed and framed, Unturnedâuntamedâ If blood-stained Might Hath mocked at Right! When scarlet crimes Appal the times It searcheth sore The Heart's quick coreâ And through and through Still smites anewâ The Sinner's scourge That still doth urge The wretch to fly From every eyeâ That goads him sore For evermoreâ The mourner's bane, Still doubling pain Increasing stillâ The gloomy ill. Oh! Power of thought, 'Tis thou hast taught The high to stoopâ The strong to droopâ The fierce to sinkâ The brave to shrink!â But then beside Extendest wide Thy empire freeâ Triumphantly To crownâto bless With Happinessâ Where Virtue lives And gently gives Her holy aid To hearts afraid, Then, then thou'rt bright With Heavenly Lightâ Full oft, though care Still frowneth there! The Poor man's wealth, The sufferer's health, The exile's bland Bright native land, The prisoner's fair Fresh free-born air, The lone one's friendâ Thought! Thought! no end, No narrow bound Can there be found To thy bright Power And Heaven-given dower When Virtue's smile Shines down the while Serene on thee Victoriously.â But yet, but yet Earth's fond regret Will oft dispute With struggle mute Thy milder reignâ Again to pain Will darkly turn And teach to burn Thy tenderer vein Of soothing strainâ In error fond I looked beyond The sober truth, And dreamt in sooth A false fair dream Like meteor's beam, When late I spoke Of Sorrow's yoke By thee made light, Her darkness brightâ Ah! 'tis not so! The o'erwhelming woe Though chasedâdisplaced, Awhile effacedâ Recoils upon The wearied one Long triedâlong troubled, With strength redoubledâ The moment's gleam Makes murkier seem The after gloom Of clouded doomâ And though thy form Be of the storm, The rainbow bright Displayed to sight, Fair Virtue! still The griefâthe ill Will have and hold Its full share told, Its own dark part O'the human heart I'the human hours Which bend to Powers Of Woe and Pain, And own their reignâ The exile dreams Of mounts and streams Long severed far,â Beneath a star Of gentle ray, Whose silvery play Familiar shone His gaze uponâ He sudden starts, His Heart of Hearts Is pierced and wrung, He feels among Cold strangers still The trembling thrill Of joy is past, It could not lastâ The captive ponders In thought he wanders Uncheckedâunchained, No more restrained, O'er green, glad fields Whose verdure yields A deep delight More full of might Than e'er before His bosom's core A wakening knewâ Warmed through and throughâ With feelings sweet That mingling meet Profoundly there And banish careâ His own chains clank!â He shrinks, as shrank His heart, while first Those chains accursed Were round him thrown, The Vision's flown!â And when it fades, Alas! the shades Of Prison gloom At once assume A depth more drear To chill with fearâ More dark, more dread Those shades are spread Around the eyes That saw arise A minute past Fair landscapes, fastâ And skies all smiling Blue, bright, beguilingâ And quivering gleams From well-known streams, And emerald bowers, And rainbowed flowers!â The lone one turns With heart that yearns To other years, And soft appears By musing brought Before his thought Full many a form Bright, glowing, warmâ To light, to bless His loneliness!â But something breaks The charmâthen aches With heavier sense Of sick suspense His lonely heart, Condemned to part With that sweet dream Which Heaven did seem! Uncertain all If to his call Shall evermore E'en as before Such imagery Enchanted be Allowed to appear To charm and cheer His solitude, His loveless mood! Thus Thoughtâcrowned Thought! On Earth thou'rt fraught With more of pain To breast and brain Than aught besideâ While Love and Pride, While Grief and Shame Our mortal frame Distracting wring And scourge and sting! And none may shun Thy swayânot one! In vain men speed O'er mount and mead O'er marsh and main In vainâin vain, To 'scape from thee It may not be, The Power of Pain Doth still remain, The sense of Shame Still stings the same, Crime's consciousness Doth still oppress With crushing force Of black remorse The offender's Soul, Though oceans roll Between him wide, And that spot dyed With memories dark With fatal mark Of stern deeds done Erewhile thereon. Oh! Dragon Fly! That hurrieth by, Thou speedest not From spot to spot To escape the woe, To avoid the blow, To shun the grief, To seek relief, Thou fearest no ill, Thou dost but still Bright pleasures new In joy pursue! Pleased all the while!â For sunlight's smile Sufficient is To o'erflow with bliss That little breast So lightly blest! We speed in chase From place to place, Full fondly bent With keen intent To find at last Delightâsurpassed, Approached, by nought E'er glimpsed in thought, But all the while That we beguile With hope so fair (A dream of air Quick Hope and bright With fairy might) Our hearts we know, Oh! iron Woe! Of thee indeed (Too seldom freed) The truth unkind!â Aye! Soul and Mind Still feel and know The dull, the slow Reality Of theeâof thee! Yet, Dragon Fly, That hurriest by, I envy not Thy cloudless lot.â 'Mid grief and gloom And pain and doom, And strife and doubt Must I work out That future fate Which doth await My Soul when borne On wings of Mornâ Beyond the tomb, And Death and Doom! But, glorious thought!â With transport fraughtâ If not to stray From one right way, From one straight path That fair end hath, May now be mine, Through Aid Divine What boundless good Not understood, Not dreamt of here, Too deep, too dearâ Shall I then share In raptures there Where bright increase Doth never cease Of joy and gladness Unmixed by sadness! What triumphs true Shall proudly too Repay me there For toil and careâ Then Love that learnt While here it burnt, Oh! still the same, A Heavenly flame 'Mid smothering clouds And dulling shrouds, And airs unblest In wild unrest, Its own sweet strength Shall learn at length That it was born For Light and morn, For bliss, for good, There it shall brood (The Eternal Dove, Divinest Love!â) For evermore Enraptured o'er Itself serene In that blest scene! No longer grieved, Betrayed, deceived, And darkly crossed, And fiercely tossed O'er wild waste waves, Where ceaseless raves The hoarse harsh blast, And lowers o'ercast The frowning Sky Unpityingly, No longer torn By hate or scorn, And made to endure Ills, nought can cure; Aggrieved, abused, Wrung, wounded, bruised, The martyr still Whom fiendish skill Exhausted seemed, (For so had deemed Soft Pity viewing That fierce undoing) In torturing on Till Life was done In torturing ever With foul endeavour! On this dark Earth Whose barren dearth Uncheering frowned His steps around. Oh! Love, no more Tried, sharp, and sore, Shalt thou then be, But fair and free Shalt thou elate Then bless thy fate, Exult, rejoice, With full-crowned choice, And ever rest Of joy possessed In golden peace That will not cease! Oh! Dragon Fly! Speed swiftly by, I envy not Thy merry lot! No! pass along In freedom strong, And fleetly run While shines the Sun Thy little race!â Thou'lt leave no trace Behind, glad thing, When once thy wing Droops low and weak, And nought shall speak Of thee, when thou Across the bough No more may cast Thy shadows fast, Nor brighten day As with a ray Of magic power Through many an hourâ But this is nought To theeâno thought Hath ever leapt, No dream hath swept Through thy calm breast Of perfect rest!â Thou canst not care Bright Sunshine's heir For aught that may On future day Perchance take place, But runn'st thy race Of cloudless cheer Without a fearâ In joyâwithout A passing doubt!â Nor bliss can cloy, From joy to joy Thou hurriest on Till all is done! Then not a trace On Nature's face Shall tell of thee That eye can see! Then nought remains Like Summer's rains In flowret's cup Full soon dried up By sunny rayâ All's passed away! But thou'lt know not That thou'rt forgot. No! thou indeed Wilt never heed That none regret Thy glad Star's set, Thou, thou canst ne'er Be made aware Of thy changed fateâ And fallen state! Yet, Dragon Fly, I heave no sigh While watching thee Thus light and free, I envy not Thy careless lotâ Before mine eyes Proud Destinies Unfold, unroll, And tempt my Soul! Far, far away From this dim day That shines o'er Earth Shall that take birth! And that perchance In dazzling trance Shall too forget How rose and set The Suns of Skies Whose loveliest dyes Of orient rose Or blue repose, Or evening's gold Were dim and cold, Besides the Light That then in sight Shall streaming shine All, all divine! Thatâthat perchance In flashing trance Shall dream, nor know What may below Then come to passâ While like a glass It mirrors deep The pomps that sweep Before its ken Serenely then, This World the while So base and vile Effaced and razed From thoughts emblazed With truths and things Whose shadow flings O'er Earth below A glorious glow! Aye! that may thus Victorious O'er all it bore In days of yore, Nor know nor heed Nor dream indeed What happens here On this far sphereâ For it Earth's sway Hath passed away, Hath fleeted by As utterly Ere it can gain Its high domain As, Dragon Fly, When thou dost die Depart from thee All things that beâ Thy portion while In Sunlight's smile Thou revell'st here Without a fear. Oh! Dragon Fly! Swift hurrying by, I envy not Thy careless lotâ I heave no sigh When thou speed'st by On restless wing! Fair happy thing! STANZAS. FROM A MANUSCRIPT POEM. To thee I give my Soulâmy very Soul Crown my Devotion's hope with one sweet thought, One thought of thine shall still seem worth the whole Of my deep dreamy Beingâpassion-fraught! One thought of thine shall still appear to me More precious than my Soul's existence all, Is it in vain that I but live to be The willing slave of such a Passion's thrall? It cannot beâne'erâne'er hath fallen to waste So deep a love and so devoted yet, Howe'er it be on this vile Earth misplaced, By selfish passions and dark wrongs beset. It must pursue its path, proclaim its power, Its Fortunes finish, and fulfil its Fate, It must, it will have its victorious hour, Though dark its Destiny, and brief its date. It must, it will its living might exert, And win some answer to its ardent prayer, It mustâit willâits influence deep assert Nor melt, a moment's meteor, lost in air! If it may nought atchieve besides, at least It may to thee thy fatal power reveal, And if for me no sigh may heave thy breast, For others thou mayst still be taught to feel! It may unfold to thee what Love can be, How beautiful, how mighty, and how trueâ Make thee in love with Love, though not with me, And tempt thy heart the Heav'n-born guest to woo! It may disclose to thee, Oh! loveliest one, How others' happiness of heart and mind May hang thy will, thy thoughtless will upon, And teach thee to be merciful and kind! Then shall it not be wasted all in sooth, But Iâalas! Beloved One! look on meâ Must the poor heart that glows with this deep truth, Be wastedâcrushed with loneliest misery? ON A FÃTE HELD IN THE OPEN AIR. 'Tis a Paradise of Labyrinths this where all enchantments blend, And to the very Soul deep, deep their rich prevailment send! Oh! Flowers! bright Poetry of Earth! ye are the treasures here, And the fairest, sweetest, loveliest,âthe most exquisite and dear! 'Tis one Paradise of Labyrinths, this the eye perplexed may stray From path to pathâwhere fancy's self must fondly lose her way, But every path is fair and bright, then heed not which you take, But wander lightly, freely on for careless wandering's sake. Oh! 'tis Pleasure is the Sovran here, and Pleasure let us serve, Nor from her shining path marked out with stars and roses swerve! Light are her gentle hests in soothâsoft is her silken yoke, Her honeyed counsels sweet and mild, who e'er such bright bonds broke?â Oh! enough of cark, enough of care, enough of pain and gloom Attend us on our journey through this pathway to the tomb, Let us step aside, one little while to hear the glad birds sing, To snatch Spring-flowers, Spring-gleams, Spring-sweets, while yet it may be Spring! Oh! Zephirs, Sunshine, Roses, here, weave chains of deep delight, And we surrender up our Souls to Joy's victorious might, And graceful works of taste and skill are brightly grouped around, And in Nature's magic circle and Art's charmed zone we're bound! Hail to the festal hour!â'tis well to rest from cark and care, And bask in Sunshine's smile awhile, and breathe the free fresh airâ Hail to the festal hour!â'tis well from time to time to turn From graver thoughts, and deeper things, and scenes more dark and stern. Oh! there's wisdom sure in smiling!âhow beautiful is Joy When in a cup of purity 'tis stained with no alloy, When innocence, young innocence combines with lightsome mirth Can aught of fairer, lovelier be upon the face of Earth! Oh! Beautiful is young Delight, and gladness ev'n sublime, When we think how we disport ourselves on the precipice of time, For we hang on the sustaining hand and cast away our care, And we smile upon a smiling world, and we feel Heaven's eye is there. Oh! Beautiful are Festivalsâfor this fair reason still, When we think how man is compassed round with danger and with ill; It is a noble sight to see his cloudless brow and clear, While armed with blameless confidence he banishes dull fear. Oh! Beautiful are Festivals! 'Tis well to set apart Some hours to soften and to soothe the harassed human heart, So that vanity and luxury still forbear to taint the mirth; Oh! Beautiful are Festivals on this overshadowed earth. The workday cares and toils do sheathe the heart with hardened crust Of selfishness and cautiousnessâthose hours lave off the dust; 'Tis as a breath of Eden's bliss, and freshness and repose, When the sun laughs light on festal hours, and the scenes of turmoil close. Most needful 'tis from time to time to glad the Soul and cheer, Relaxing from the watch, the march, the attentive mood austere; Our Earth herself the example givesâwith fruits she mingles flowers, And the fairest yield no increase oftâshe holds her festal hours! Oh! Beautiful are Festivals! but loveliest those I call, Which are not held beneath the domeâwithin the crowded hallâ Assemble in the garden still, the shaded grove, the fieldâ Oh! Beautiful are Festivals when in Nature's Temple held. 'Tis well to build up for ourselves, despite of Fear and Fate, A light and fleeting happiness that suits our fleeting state, Tho' no memory may survive of this, still, still the Soul may be The better for its dream-like bliss, and calm enjoyment free. For real and certain Happinessâtoo seldom may it prove Our portion here, while yet 'mid cares and trials we must move, And when 'tis ours, alas!âhow oft the Parent 'tis of ill, Melting the Soul with tenderness that should be strengthened still! No! the joy that o'er its surface gleams like sunlight o'er the Sea, Haply more fitted to our fate and to our frame may be, It lasts not!âbut doth Happiness last longer? No! in sooth, Pleasure's fond fiction may survive Felicity's tried truth. How Beautiful are Festivalsâthey win us to forget With a divine forgetfulness, Time's wrongs and our regret, They bid us to remember tooâwith sweet and strong controul, How capable of Happiness is the ever living Soul. Oh! Beautiful are Festivals, we dream we're blest and free, And still we are, while thus we can believe ourselves to be, Perchance our happiest hours are those wherein content we are, With something like thy shadowâOh! bright HappinessâLife's Star. LINES (FROM INEZ, AN MS. POEM.) Yes!âyes!âI laughed and scoffed, and many a jest Seemed to spring lightly from a careless breast, Great Heaven! could'st thou have guessed, or dreamed, or known How utterly that heart was all thine own, Which promptedâno! not promptedâbut endured The burst of mirth it from its depths abjured; Could'st thou have guessed or dreamed how while I smiled, My Soul one gurge of madding passion boiled, Thou would'st have pitied her thou could'st upbraid, Because to thee it seemed she mocking played, And laughed and trifled in capricious mood!â Our human heart is little understood Even by each otherâand from thence doth spring Unnumbered woes, unuttered suffering! But it is wellâI would not have thee know The depth or of my feeling or my woe, I would not have thee read my secret soul, Still let the folding clouds about it roll; The love too richly precious to be known Even by its object, must be all mine own. Fold after fold is wrapped that idol round, The adored, the shrined, the throned, the enwreathed and crowned, Within the deepest chambers of my heart Doth it remainâungazed on, and apart! The priceless treasure of my solitudeâ The charm of my most self-concentered mood, The crown of mine existenceâand the cure Of every ill that I on earth endure, Excepting those that from itself do spring, And something heavenly stamps that suffering; I bear its bane, and bless it while I bearâ And call it a most choice and costly care! I should be fearful of my very joy Were it not mixed with measure of alloy; An anxious thing on Earth 'tis to possess An all supreme and single happinessâ By doubts uncurbed, unclouded, and uncrossed, What if that treasure of our trust be lost? What if the Soul which doth that transport own Be from the heights of such a Heaven dashed down? But Storm and Star commingle and consent In my Love's wild and wond'rous Firmamentâ 'Tis not so full of Light that I need fear The hour of change and waning must be near! Mine own and dear Oneâthou could'st see me smile And deem my heart was free and light the whileâ Deem that the laugh, the taunt, the gibe bespoke A bosom spared the burthen and the yokeâ It was not soâit is not so!âbelieve With boundless passion doth that bosom heave! Oh! oftentimes do they most deeply feel Who least displayâwho ever least revealâ The mask of careless laughter oft is made The screen of feelings, that if once betrayed, Would carry all before them, and o'erpower With strange surprise in their Revealment's hour! The flowery surface of the Earth may hide The mines that teem with gems of burning pride, The fleecy clouds that swift through Skyland sail, Curled into countless shapes by the eager gale, May hold within their silent beauteous breast The Lightningsâwaiting in upfolded rest. Must you not cut through thousand laughing waves, Sparkling and glitteringâsuch the Diver braves To find the pearlâwhich doth embosomed sleep Cloistered and cradled up within the deep? Mine own and dear One!âmy great love for thee Surpasseth show, and must unspoken be, That Love in its intense unknown excessâ (Throned between Agony and Happiness!)â In its unutterable richness lies So perfectâpriceless and so proud a prize, So unapproached by utteranceâso unreached By language, though divinely pleading, preached The Voice of Eloquence with might supreme On that exhaustless and unbounded themeâ So placed beyond Expression's loftiest powersâ In fervid Inspiration's happiest hours, That the light laugh which from my lips rang out, And woke Mirth's echoes buoyantly about, As well expressed it and revealed as well, As deeply could impartâas dearly tell As all the strength that in Earth's language lies, As tears, or sighs, or groans, or agonies, None could come near itâ'tis beyond all thought, Above all understandingâmystery-fraught. Then pardon me a laugh that told as much As wildest words or actions could avouch, Since these too striving to proclaim that truth, Could but as weakly waste their strength in soothâ Since these too struggling to unfold such tale, Could but as wholly and as wildly fail! THE WATERS IMAGE BACK. The waters image back the skies, And on their glistening bosom lies The distant worldâthe severed star Still, still as severed and as far! Let my heart thus the image bear Of one than fairest Star, more fairâ Nought else I askâOh! more than dear, Thus only canst thou mine appear! EXCEPTING THEE! Let others search for fameâfor goldâ Let others win them too, and holdâ Let others strive for all that man Most covets in his petty spanâ I nothing heed, I nothing see Excepting theeâexcepting thee! Let others toil with zealous care For some bright guerdon proud and fair, And suffer long, and struggle hard For their desired and dear reward, My meed is in my ministery, Adoring theeâadoring thee! Let others this fair World condemn Because it was not made for them, And distant orbs more glorious call And place this ever last of allâ To me it seems first, best to be, Possessing theeâpossessing thee! Let others for the future still Workâwith the onlooking thought's strong willâ Aspiring ever with winged power To meet the oncoming Future's hour! Sure, Time himself stands still with me, Beholding theeâbeholding thee! THE CROWDED HALL. I hasten to the crowded Hall on Pleasure's festive night, Dark is the shadowy World withinâlet the World without be brightâ Yes! I will join the glittering crowdâmix in the smiling trainâ A truce to memory and to fearâto passion and its pain! Their proud joy now shall be my joy and I will feel with them, They who come shining, smiling forth with the garland and the gem, I too will snatch the flower from Spring in its first blush of birth, And I will ask its jewels too of this our gloomy Earth. And I will echo back the laughâreflect the sunny smile, And dream that I am glad and free and careless too the while, I will with watchful zeal thus play my part too with the rest, Shall the heartless and the false, ere read deep Truth's and Feeling's breast? I stand now 'mongst the crushing crowd together and apart, I listen to the clamouring crowd, and answer mine own heart, And have I gained mine end in sooth, and gained my darling aimâ Nor have I lost, nor wholly wonâanother and the same! On the bounding waves of Pleasure borne that pale Star still I mark, Without which all for me is drear, and clouded o'er anddark, And yet that pale Star well I know but lures me to my fate, My bark tempts ruin still, with all, its hopes a costly freight! But hence, vain thoughts, the sparkle now the foam wreath and the spray, Attract my eye and brightly charm my lingering fears awayâ I smile at mine own sorrowing heart, 'tis gladdened and 'tis grieved, And almost hates itself that thus hath Pleasure's stamp received. No more am I the mourner nowâyet e'en while I rejoice, That full heart lifteth faintly up its never-silent voice, And tossed 'twixt Pleasure and 'twixt Pain like some wind shaken flame, Abide I 'midst the Revellersâanother and the same! ALONE, AND WORSE EV'N THAN ALONE. Alone, and worse ev'n than alone, From self half parted now!â Well may I still the struggling moan, And calm the clouding brow! I have forgotten how to hope, To wish, fear, shun, or seek, Still let me lone and friendless droop In speechless suffering meek. Alone, and worse ev'n than alone, From self divided now, Sorrow is for my shadow grown, And whereâOh! where art thou? Answers my heavy, heavy heart With one dire throb âAll's fled!ââ Then let the lonely One depart, Whose Hope is with the Dead! MOTHER!âSWEET MOTHER!âHASTE. Mother!âsweet Mother!âhaste, And fold me to thy heart, In those kind arms embraced, Less deadly seems Grief's smart. But ask me notâNo! no!â Ne'er ask me why I mourn, Nor seek to sound my woe, Nor strive to steal the thorn! Still give me tear for tear, Still grant me sigh for sigh, 'Tis all thou canst do here, No change comes till I die! Still yield me tear for tear, And clasp mine aching brow, Breathe kind words in mine ear, 'Tis all thou canst do now! Yes! pity me, and seek To make my wild tears flow, But urge me not to speak My deep and deadly woe. Mother!âforbearâforbearâ If that thou lov'st thy child, 'Twould sharpen my despair To speak of pangs so wild! To speak?âI dare not think Upon my boundless woe, Who gazes o'er the brink Still tempts the depths below! Mother!âsweet Mother!âhaste, On thy heart let me lie, In those kind arms embraced Would I depart and die! GO! SISTER! Go! Sister, to the Vintage Feast, Though I, alas! with thee go not; Haste, haste thee, like a bird released, To that sweet sunny festal spot. Ask me not why, I smile no more, Ask me not why, I thus forbear To join the throng as heretofore, Nor in the inspiring gladness share. Sweet Sister! days perchance may come, When thou, too, thus may ev'n deplore And haunt that disenchanted home, Which can delight and bless no more. When thou may'st shrink from every sound Of noisy happiness and mirth, And looking ever on the ground, Bend near and nearer to the Earth. That earth which may at lastâat lastâ Take unto peace the outwearied heart; Which beat too wildly warm, and fast, For this its heavy mortal part! Oh! go then, gentlest Sister sweet, And if thy young heart fondly learns, Love piercedâto throb, to burn, and beat, Take warning thus from her who mourns! ROSE! Rose! regal rose!âhow rich thou art, Beauty blazeth at thy heart, One treasury of precious things, Art thou, whom gladsome summer brings As the crown of all delight, As the symbol of her right, O'er each living heart to reign, Sense and spirit to enchainâ Thee she bringsâand we confess The omnipotence of loveliness? Rose! regal rose! transcendant flower, Thou hast a refulgent dower, Thou hast a bright opulence, And a dreamy freight intense Of odours, graces, burning dyesâ Sun of Earth! which like the skies, Thou mak'st beautiful and bright, All one blush of laughing light,â Sun of Earth! we laud thee while We do bask in thy red smileâ Thou art full of witcheries deepâ Thou thy sway dost ever keepâ Poets have made thee their theme, Lovers wreathed thee with their dream, Mourners laid thee by their dead, Round the pallid pillowed head, Maidens twined thee with their locks, Conquerors, spared from battle shocks, Have given thee at the banquet place Victory's purple feast to graceâ Stern philosophers have loved thee, Sage and statesmen old approved thee, Monarchs 'midst their emblems worn thee' On their crests of glory borne thee! They have had thee strewed before them, While their shouting people bore them, To their coronation on, To the altarâto the throne. RoseâOh! regal, regal rose, Thou'rt the loveliest flower that blowsâ A little summer of delight Is gathered in thine urn so bright, A rich Arabia of perfumes In each leaf that blushing blooms; Aye! a heaven of summer lies, 'Mid thy burning royal dyes, In thy deep and dazzling breast Nature's brightest flower and best!â And thou mak'st, all sweet as fair, One Arabia of the airâ That around thee broods and sighs If in far Arabia lies The soul of odour full and deep That in bliss the sense doth steep! Did they fable forth of old A Flora of celestial mould?â And name her Goddess of the Flowers Guardian Queen of blossomed bowersâ Did they thus in the olden days, And did they know thy crimson blaze? Did they reck thy costly breath, Did they boast thy crowning wreath, How could they thro' fair summer's hours Mistake the Goddess of the Flowers?â Thou'rt their Goddessâglorious Rose! Each to thee deep worship owes, True allegianceâadorationâ Crown of all the flowered creation. Regal Rose, thy matchless mien Thee proclaimeth for their Queen, Thou'rt the Flora of the flowers, Thou'rt the Goddess of the bowers? We the Rose their Goddess call Reign in beauty o'er them allâ Still consummate flower remain Darling of the Poet's strain, Still light up the lover's dream With a passion-painting gleamâ Still around the pallid dead Tints of life-like beauty shed, And cheat the mourner for awhile With a warm reflected smile! Still amidst the all glossy braids O'er the brows of blushing maids, Twine, bright flower!âand make more fair The golden burnish of their hair! At the conqueror's festal board, Flower! all worshipped and adored, Smileâand from his haughty heart Half the sternness shall departâ Win philosopher and sage Still to read thy heavenly page, Thy book of beauty still to read, And honour nature's works indeed! For in thee, as in the star, Her vast powers developed are! And her wond'rous skill we trace As in worlds that lighten spaceâ In thy leaf and in thy stem, She fashioned theeâshe fashioned them! Man can make nor flower to blow, Nor world to blaze, nor may he know All the mysteries of their making, All the wonders of their wakingâ When from Nothing they're called forth Full of beauty, grace, and worthâ Thou shall set the blood astir In heart of stern philosopher, He shall look upon thy blaze And thro' many a glowing maze Shall his thoughts like lightning run, All commingling into oneâ For a deep and fervent sense Of Nature's powerful Providence, And her boundless goodness too, Shall with influence just and true Quicken all his heart and mind Knowing for what ends designed All her works and wonders are Whether Flower or flaming Starâ Whether world in heav'ns abyss, Or the tenderest growth of this. Rose, still charm the sage's eye With thy fair refulgency, Still resplendently revealed, Shine thou on the monarch's shield, By the imperial eagle's side Be thou placed in equal pride!â Where the crowded symbols shine, Telling of his glorious line, Beam in beauty and in state, And the blazon consecrateâ And upon his crest of glory, Tell then rose! thine own sweet story. Hint of nature, beauty, truth, Breathe of love's own golden youth, And around that proud crest twined Do thou also rose! remind, That Kingsâlike gorgeous flowers which gleam Amidst their heraldries supreme (Flowers that vanish from the field, Though they fade not on their shield) Must decline, and wane, and fall, Sharing thus the doom of all! Roseâstill blush along the way Where in long-drawn pomp's array The coronation's train comes on To seat the annointed on his throne, Thereâ'mid jewels' bickering blaze, Startling suddenly the gaze, 'Mid the sweep of plumes that toss Silvery in the sunlight's gloss, 'Mid the wave of banners wide With their rich elaborate pride, 'Mid the Minster's shadows frowning, Be the coronation's crowning! Nothing fairer eye can see 'Mid its glories, flower, than thee; Though thou'rt trampled, trodden downâ Thou'rt the coronation's crown. All seems artificial there, Saving theeâdivinely fair; There dost thou breathe, smile, and liveâ Nature's representative! And she reignsâev'n there she reignsâ And her wonted sway retains, In her lovely envoy's form, Glowing, beautiful, and warm; Roseâregal rose! for evermore Let us praise thee and adore; Nations-Empires pass away, Sciences and arts decay, Lost, forgotten, and unknown, Towers and cities are o'erthrown; Ages after agesâthou, Rose, shalt reign as thou dost now, Nature shall her pride renewâ Evermore as bright of hue, Man shall evermore admire, Ever laud theeâflower of fire! 'Tis as though Heaven's living blaze Of still descending falling rays In one spot gathered, mixed, entwined, Together clustered and combinedâ Had enkindled into theeâ Gloriously, triumphantly! Sun of Earth! consummate rose! Whose sweet leaves of light disclose New enchantments without end, While on them our looks we bend; When this world shall pass away On the dread and nameless day, Shalt thou thenceforth be no moreâ With thy beauty's boundless store! Surely in unfading bowers Thou wilt smile through changeless hours, 'Mid deathless blooms of Heav'nly birth, Flower of BeautyâSun of Earth! Sun of Earth! thou dost even nowâ As do all things fair as thouâ Remind of higher holier things, And make us thirst for Heav'nly springs! LINES ON THE SUN. Sun! Beatific Sun, i' the year's wintriest day If thou com'st forth with pomp in every ray, A little world of summer round thee smiles, The barren clouds laugh out to flowery isles, To little skyey oases of bliss Too fair to gaze on from a world like this, Without fond yearnings and keen longings deep To climb the severing and untrodden steep! Sun! Beatific Sun, thrice glorious Sun, Thou can'st make precious all thou look'st upon, All things grow beautiful beneath thine eyeâ As though they drank Ã¦therial poetry, From thy divinest aspectâwas the Sea Set in this earth to be a glass for thee! Were the unnumbered stars with their soft rays Scattered, to be as foils to thy crowned blaze, Through endless space (when trembling into light They wake remembrance of thy matchless might) Through endless space that sparkles with their gleamsâ But burnsâbut blazes with thy Kingly beams! Sun! Beatific Sun! 'tis thou hast given To us clay-moulded mortals Earth and Heaven, For both to thy enlightening beams we oweâ Without which neither could we view or know; And still from thee, Oh! orb divinely bright, We mount in thought towards the Light of Light. Thou Godlike Sun!âthou shinest but to say, âMy Maker bade me make the glorious day, I shine upon His worldsâobey His word, And sway the universe to serve its Lord; I reign and rule His great creation still, To make that reign subservient to His will!â Oh! bear the brightness of a perfect day Far through our Souls, and let each stainless ray Meet with a thought as pure and as serene, And brighten thou that Spiritual Scene, For powers of darkness there full often brood, And turn to evil all our hopes of good. Sun!âBeatific Sun! no ray of thine Upon that Spiritual Scene can shine, A Heavenlier Lightâa Spiritual Sun Must shine and smile those clouds awayâor none. TO ONE DEPARTED. Thou'rt gathered like a shock of corn For the eternal harvestâLo! A few years since thou wert not born, A few moreânone thy name shall know! So is it with the race of man, Well may we say he passeth soon, His troubled days are but a spanâ His breath a vain and fleeting boon. We pass each other on the race, One fallsâthe others struggle on, We ever take each other's place, Nor think on those who are past and gone. Yes!âwhere they trod we careless tread, Inheriting the world from them, Successors of those shrouded Dead Whom to oblivion we condemn. Millions have died to give us place, But we need pity not their lot, Once deadâthey live throughout all space, We dying, live on one small spot! For day by day we're dying still, And waning on unto the end, No strength, no science, and no skill, Can from the eternal Foe defend. And thou hast joined that countless host Who have departed from the Earth, Thou art among the many lost Who leave no record of their birth. But whilst I yet am spared to breathe, In thoughtful prayers thy name beloved, Thou shalt remembered be beneath, Though far beyond all dreams removed! DEFIANCE. Away strong Love!âaway, I will resist, I will defy thee still while I exist, I dare not sink before thy flowery shrine, Another partâa different lot is mine; I will defy thee, Love, And ne'er thy mastery prove. If once I yielded to thy fearful sway, My passionate Soul would pour itself away In luxury of self-scorning recklessness, Even to thy worshipâwreaked upon excess, And should I thus forego My nobler hopes below? No! I will still avoid theeâstill disown, Nor make my Heart thy world, my Soul thy throne, By higher duties called, and loftier claims, That Heart and Soul are warmed by prouder flames; I may not weakly pine Beneath such rule as thine! I know if my impassioned hope and trust Were once bowed down unto the dismal dust, My misery and mine agonized distress Should grow still darkling, deepening to excess And madness 'twere indeed, To nail them on Love's reed. No! Love! I will defy thee and deny, I will forswear thy pow'râthy presence fly, And at thy least approach will shrink away, Lest I be won to yield unto thy sway; I will defy thee still Dark Love! thou deadliest ill! No word of thine shall reach my guarded ear, Too much thy false and fatal power I fear, I shun thee stillâAh! treacherous that thou art, Who 'scapes the shaft that once hath struck his heart? Farâfar must I remove, Ere I can shun thee, Love! Vain are the guarded ear, the watchful eye, (Alas! I own it with a shuddering sigh) When the dire Foe, the dark unbidden Guest Doth in the heart's own core securely rest; Vain are the vauntings nowâ The vigil and the vow! BRIGHTEST SPRING. Brightest Spring, thou'rt here again, And Nature drops her Winter's chain; The world seems young and fresh once more, Creation doth thy smile adore! Beautiful thou art! and thou Makest our world as beauteous now; Golden lights are in the skies, On the Earth ten thousand dyes, Fair the Sun in Heaven's vault shines, And as though the Earth's golden mines All were o'er her surface spread, She the splendour overheadâ Doth as lustrously reflect, And an equal pomp affect! Brightest Spring, thou'rt here again, The world now drops its winter's chain, It is free and glad once more, And with beauty running o'er; Oh! enchanted time and dear, Spring for ever welcome here! Hark! it is the warbling thrush, Quick his notes of rapture gush! Listen! 'tis the gladsome lark, Hence! away with care and cark! Look! Oh transport to the view, 'Tis the violet bursting through! Pause!âfeel'st thou the velvet sod? Soft as ever fairies trod; Markâis not that odorous breath Wafted from Spring's new-pleached wreath? Oh! thou brightest season smile O'er field and rock and mount and isle, O'er Earth and air, o'er sea and shoreâ For the ocean's purple floor Wins a more enchanting hue, A deeper and diviner blue, When thy steps of lightness pass O'er itâmaking it thy glass, (Worthy of thy radiant form When untroubled by the stormâ And thou bid'st the storm awayâ To await a darker day;) While the grateful Ocean flings O'er thy many-coloured wings Its bright watersâlike a charm, Thee with mightier power to arm, Every drop hath freshening power To improve thy lustrous hour; And o'er all the smiling land, Where thou tak'st thy happy stand, From his treasury is shed Freshness, beauty, widely spread; The air too richly overflows With tints and treasures of the Rose!â Up its golden labyrinths run My strong thoughts! unto the Sun! Whence this lovely thing is born That doth all the scene adorn, Bask in his unbounded blaze Twine yourselves 'mid his rich rays! All the air is flushed and filled With those beams that deepening gild Day by day the enkindling Earth, Wakening from her wintery dearth? Spring! the world at thy sweet call Startles from its gloomy thrall, Rises up as from the tomb In a glory of young bloomâ Should not this remind all men How themselves will rise again From the dark and frozen grave The yet unopened world-wide cave? Where unknown, unseen, remain Bound in more than icy chain, Myriads, upon myriads heaped Heaven's vast harvest yet unreapedâ Spring! more precious far than thine Through thy treasures brightly shine, Are the treasures deeply laid In the Grave's far-reaching shadeâ They that there await the hour Which shall call them forth in power From the darkness of the tomb, To put on immortal bloomâ Spring! thy beauty makes me glad, Should thy lessons make me sad? No! that beauty is as nought To the hopes that thou hast brought! LINES, WRITTEN IN MY GARDEN AT ?. Birds, bells, and lulling bees, and measured oars, Mixed with a calm the raptured Soul adores, Here captive make the senses and the heart, Each lovely sound would lovely be apart, But thus commingling in one full-toned strain, 'Twould charm the deaf dull ear of groaning pain, Disperse the thoughts of Sorrow's mournful breast, And bid delight a moment be its guest; Exalt the worldling's grovelling fancies even, And give the erring Soul one dream of Heaven! Yet, no! this harmony might discord prove To hearts not gently tuned to perfect love; It is the bosom's concord that alone Can lend its sweetness to each separate tone. Birds, bells, and bees, and dip of measured oars Should grating be as when the night wind roars Against the watcher's casement, if no note From the deep Soul might with them thrilling float, And stamp them into musicâif it send No breath of bliss with their sweet sounds to blend, If no pure tone of glad and calm assent Spring from the peaceful bosom of content, No Jubilate from the heart bursts forth To lend them mystic and melodious worthâ Then glad am I by this sure test to find That peace and hope are throned within my mindâ For all is music to my ear and heart, While thus I linger sheltered, and apart From the World's busy, noisy, troubled scenes, From which my Spirit with aversion leansâ No tone discordant o'er my sense doth jar, No sigh the enchanted melody can marâ But all is pleasure still, for all is peace, And need I fear the blessed charm should cease? No! all must still be gladness and repose, And harmony, which no distraction knowsâ All, still sweet music to my ear and heart, Dearest! since discord comes not where thou art, While truth and faith and gratitude combine To make me wholly Love's and wholly thine! LOVE ME NOT! Love me not!âlove me not!âI could not be A sorrow and a bitterness to thee, I would not be thy chastisement, thy doom, And shouldst thou love me, such must I become! Thou, whose glad path with starry beams is lit, Canst little guess how gloomily unfit A dark deep Spirit like mine own must prove For Love's light dreamâfor the sweet sway of Love! I would not haunt thee with mysterious gloom, Nor cast o'er thee the shadows of my doom, Nor teach thee the misdoubtings, the mistrust With which I look on all things that are dust. And all I see and meet still seems to me To share the dust of my mortality, Hope is a flutterer that just forward flies, Then folds her fairy wings and falls and dies. Love is but selfishness in lovelier shape, A struggle from our suffering solves to 'scape, And to avoid the storms by which we're tossed, And so 'twill lastâtill the illusion's lost! Love me not!âlove me not!âlook not on me If thou would'st happy and unchastened be, A penalty of suffering thou should'st pay For such fond rashnessâsmile that dream away. Shall the controlling check of my dark fear Bid thy hope fadeâand shall the untimely tear From my dim melancholy joyless eye Melt thy young spirit's worlds of phantasy? Aye! all thy fancy's fabrics of delight That shine so beautiful in Hope's charmed sightâ Love me not, gentle One, or these thou'lt lose, As lose the flowers at noon, morn's freshening dews. Love me not!âlove me not!âI could not bear To bend thee nearer earth with doubt and care, That lovely head was never meant to droopâ Uplifted now so gloriously in hope. Leave me to mine own dark and dismal fate, And move thou on triumphant and elate In gladness and in freedomâmove thou on In peace and pleasureâleave me lorn and lone! Withdraw from me thine every gentle thought, Say not that once thy dear regard I sought; I met an angel on my shadowy way, And paused a momentâcharmed into delay. Ah! me, that sweetest moment I forgot The dire and desperate sorrows of my lotâ But woke full soon to their remembrance back, And silently pursued my lonely track. Love me not!âlove me not!âlook not on me, Leave meâand be the happiest of the freeâ Say, could it cheer me or console to know Thou wert the sharer of my hopeless woe? Deem'st thou thy love could win me from my grief? It might, but for a season short and brief, And heavier should recoil upon my headâ The undying sorrows and the sufferings dread! Oh! love me not!âmy heart is full of fear, New forms of terror to my view appear, Fate threatens me, and all around me grows Darker and darker in this waste of woes! And would'st thou have me unto thee reveal Why this reluctance of distrust I feelâ Must I to thee the hidden truth unfold? Ah! better far to mask it and withhold! Yet, since thou will'st itâlet me own to thee Why thus I tremble at thy love for me, To thee the painful truth with candour tell, It is because I love theeâbut too well! Because too wellâtoo well I love thee stillâ And fain would spare thee every earthly ill; And know I not that loving me must call On thy devoted head Earth's miseries all? Ah? know I not that loving me must bring To thy devoted heart each keenest sting, Each deadliest dart of suffering and of painâ And clasp round thee my harsh and heavy chain. I could not liveâI could not live and know Thou wert the sharer of my wasting woe; Then, then farewell to pride and to disdain Which arm me now to grapple with my pain! Then should I grow the weakest of the weak, The changing colour on thy perfect cheek, The gathering moisture in thy matchless eye, Should crush my soul with sick despondency. And it would be so! Oh! I knowâI feel The griefs ev'n thou must fail to soothe or heal, Would pierce me through thy heart with ten-fold force, But spare me dear affection's fond remorse! In that affection's name I pray thee spareâ My wounded spirit dreads this worst despairâ Nor seek to know what are the griefs which stand 'Twixt thee and meâthat wave the flaming brand! Thy gentler heart were withered by the shock, The bare crags of the thunder-blasted rock Have little left to suffer or to dreadâ Death hath no farther terrors for the Dead! But Oh! from gay Prosperity's fair heights Swift to be hurled, to endure sharp Sorrow's blights, Yet fresh from joy's own soft and sunny clime This, this were anguishâshun it then in time. Love me not!âlove me not!âOh! hear my prayer, And leave me, to my doom of lonely care, Let me but know that cloudless, smiles thy lotâ For thy sake, and for my sakeâlove me not! EAST, WEST, SOUTH, AND NORTH. Sweet South! thine be the scenes for me, How beautiful those scenes must be, There grow the golden fruited trees, And myrtle-thickets scent the breeze, The fountains fall in music still, And vineyards gird the sunny hill. The royal Heavens of purple shine From dawn of day to day's decline, Still beautiful and blue and bright, One boundless Paradise of Light, As Heaven restored to us in love, That fair One, lost belowâabove! There all is love!âand all is light, To chain and charm the Soul and sight, And Poetry breathes still around, Soft from the kindling air and ground, And Nature bloometh like a bride In all her pomp, and all her pride! There all things living live in joy Without a measure of alloyâ There seems the World in its glad prime, Fair is the countryâfair the clime, Nay, there the golden plains and bowers Remind of lovelier Worlds than ours. Oh! balmy breezeâOh! bounteous beam, Your sighs, your smiles entrancing seem To waft us Heavenwards for awhile, But still you sighâbut still you smile, It is no tranceâno dream of blissâ A true and lasting joy is this! Sweet South! Sweet South! thy scenes I choose, All brightening o'er with sunniest hues, Aye! snatch me to the Southern Land Where prospects fair as Hope expand, Where all is blessed, all is bright, A World of Loveâa World of Light! Yet farther South, still farther, where More scorching grows the breezeless air, Full of the Sun-godâevermore Whom fervent Earth appears to adoreâ And like a worshipper to gaze Upon his full unfolded blaze. Where days of boundless beauty break, And Earth, Air, Heaven one glory make, Where nights of awful majesty Make yon starred sky one dark-blue sea Heaving round blazing isles of fire, That tempt the coldest thoughts to aspire. But, beauteous East, can I pass o'er Thy treasures' proud exhaustless store? Can I forget what splendours there Shine kindling out, supremely fair, Even where thy scenes of glorious pride Expand and smile on every side! Bright beauteous East, to thee I turn, Where gems of rainbowed glory burn All dazzlingly and strangely fair, As sunbeams shone imprisoned there, Still struggling to escape, in vain, And to their source to flow again! Blushing to be thus still detained, And thus by earthly bonds enchained! As though those sunbeams evermore Pent in the jewel's burning coreâ Trembling and quivering sought to evade The stubborn fetters on them laid. The Eastâthe Eastâthe gorgeous East, Not yet the mighty charm hath ceased Which governed me with mystic power Through many a rapt and dreaming hour, While o'er the fabling Eastern lore 'Twas mine with pleased amaze to poreâ There did the fairy's form alightâ Vouchsafed to some more favoured sight, There did the powerful Genii lurk, And their dark deeds of mystery workâ There magic took for evermore The fairest shape she ever bore! Who hath not dreamt, (that ever bent, That ever mute and breathless leant O'er that rich page whose space contains The records of their golden reigns)â Of the old crowned Caliphs of the East, And all the pomps that with them ceased? Who hath not courted for awhile, And bade those scenes of splendour smile Around them in their full-blown pride, That there are imaged forth, and dyed, With colourings magical and strange, Beautiful in their boundless change? Who hath not all those splendours seen, Who hath not overshadowed been By the proud pile's fair roof sublime That mocked all works of art and time, Whose walls by Genii hands were wrought To shame the speed of tardier thought? Who hath not, with youth's blood astir, With Sindbad been a voyager? And rapt in a delicious awe, Heard all he heard, seen all he sawâ While wonder after wonder came His kindling fancy to inflame? Then lived he in the enchanted talesâ Now o'er the unknown seas he sails, Now lands with him, his fearless guide, On some strange shore, and doth abide 'Mid the alien habitants, or try Its haunts of lonelier mystery! Who hath not gazed in thought on thee Sweet Sultaness ZobeidÃ©, And basked in Schemselnihar's smile, And owned the Queen of Beauty's wile, And with the awakened sleeper blessed Fair âLip of Coral,â and the rest? Who hath not in the Enchanted Halls, 'Midst murmuring tones of fountain falls, And precious gleams of glory bright, And odorous breathings of delight, Feasted his senses and his Soul, And raptured, made his own the whole? The Eastâthe Eastâthe gorgeous Eastâ Both sense and Soul we there may feast, Oh! bear me to the East, for there The Earth is golden and the airâ The rising Sun there rears a throne, And claims the empire for his own. There the pomegranite trees extend Their lovely umbrage to defend The wanderer from that Sun so bright, Which reigns omnipotent of light, And date-trees too their soft shade spread, And the proud palm exalts its head. There float the birds of Paradise, Like natives of the upper skiesâ Sent from the Edens of their birth To bear glad messages to Earthâ While to their glorious crests and wings Surely a light celestial clings. But, mighty West! I turn to thee, Canst thou passed o'er in silence be? Of loftiest charms art thou possessed, Oh! thou sublime and wond'rous West, Let me with startled eyes behold Thine ample beauties wide unrolled. Oh! West! whose shadowy world of Woods Re-echoes to the roar of floods, And in the Sun's immortal face Heaves up a darkness in his place, How must thy boundless features melt The Soul with awe, before unfelt! Thy mighty mountains proudly rise To lose themselves within the skies, Broad spread thy lakes of aspect bright, Unbounded oceans to the sight, Fair seas of beautyâthat unfold Glassed Heavens of purple and of gold. Oh! West! in fancy I can hear Thy stunning cataract peals of fearâ In fancy I can see extend Thy forest shadows without end, In all the umbrageous pride of gloom Which deepens like a cloud of doom! And follow too the serpentine Of thy proud rivers' silvery line, And those broad boundless prairies view Which please the eye with verdant hueâ And gaze upon thy mountain-heights Crested with jewel-coloured lights. Nor let me only in a dream Behold the forest, mount, and stream, Of vast proportions and sublime, That glorify that distant climeâ Oh! bear me o'er the severing sea To where the Western wonders be. Bear, bear me to the far-off West Across the ocean's billowy breast, And let my lifted mind expand In sight of the Majestic Land, And let my Soul be girt to hail Nature on her sublimest scale! But thou, Oh! stern and frozen North, Hast thou no glory and no worth? Have thy far frowning regions wide No beauties of severer pride? Hast thou no wonders to display, No mighty and sublime array? Aye! verily, Old North! thou hast, And o'er thine outstretched icy waste 'Twere marvellous to mark the sway Of lengthened night or lingering day, While spreads the frozen World beneath, As though it knew no life, nor breath. And marvellous and strange 'twere too, Thy mighty monster-things to view, Thy huge leviathans that keep Their hoary empire of the deepâ And in their wrath or in their play Lash the great waters into spray! And beautiful I guess 'twould be The arrows of keen light to see, That dart with dazzling splendour there, Enkindling all the brightened air, Making at once Earth, Air, and Sky A more than starry galaxy! And much of beauty might we mark Where spread thy fir-formed forests dark, Like a vast pall of funeral gloom Hung o'er some old imperial tombâ Blackening and massive, cumbering all The ground where but its shadows fall. And wond'rous must it be to see The boiling geysers bubbling free, And strange to view the icebergs vast Like moving islands floating past, And strange and beauteous to behold The snow a thousand winters old! Oh! North and South and East and West, Each are of mighty charms possessed, Wherever thou, great Nature, art, In beauty hast thou still thy part, And still dost thou disclose sublime Thy triumphs through each varying clime. And North and South and East and West Are by their mighty Maker blessed, All parts of one great Work Divine, All portions of one grand Designâ The Eternal Lord pronounced it good, And fast the proud Creation stood! And still where'er we wander forth, Or East or West or South or North, The Heavenly Hand we still may trace Through every clime and every placeâ And wondering own on sea or land The triumphs of that Heavenly Hand! And North and South and East and West The Almighty Ruler's power attest, And far as Wanderer's foot can stray, As eye of mortal can survey, Still all is gloriousâall is fair, Nature and Nature's God are there! EARTH IS PITILESS. If Sorrow overtake us here In this harsh World, the bleak and drear, Then are we left to mourn alone, To make in solitude our moan! The proud, the thoughtless, and the gay Press onwards on their prosperous way, With eager hope they onwards press, And leave us to our weariness. Aye! burdened with a weary mind, Unpitied we are left behind, By sickness of the Soul bowed down, With little comfort for our own. We feel we are deserted here On this harsh hollow World and drear, And vainly look, for none are nigh Our needsâour solace to supply. Then do we grasp the empty air, Or hug our own o'erwrought despair, Since nought for us remains on Earth But its worst darkness and its dearth. Then, then that last resourceâthe Grave Full oft, as our sole good we crave, And with the arrow in his breast The doomed one seeketh for his rest. Our dear Companions of the Past All from our view have vanished fast, Each on his shining path is gone, And we are left to sink alone! Like the Indian Woman left to die In lone and helpless misery, When faints her Soul and fails her strength On the laborious marchâat length! Like the Indian Woman left to die In desolate despondency, Her heavy eyes still straining far To gaze where her beloved ones are. None linger by her death-bed cold, Her death-bed and her graveâEarth's mouldâ None, none with kind compassion wait, Till stricken falls the blow of Fate. Her last convulsive broken sighâ The close of all her agonyâ With the receding footsteps blends The footsteps of her faithless friends Or happly with the lowering tones Of her own dearly cherished onesâ While each along the pathway hies, Nor turns to weep o'er her who dies! Or like the outwearied Soldier leftâ Of energy and hope bereftâ In some forced march of fearful length, Deprived of power, and shorn of strength. Oh! better far the rage of war, The battle's terrors better far, Than this deserted desperate doom, This sinking piecemeal to the tomb! The trampling of the host he hears, Catches the bickering light of spears, Then sees at last the long array Fade in the horizonâslow away. And of his ancient comrades none Remain to soothe the hopeless one, To breathe some parting words of cheer Or love in his unsolaced ear. Even so it is with us, when we, Oh! Grief! are smitten sore by thee, When we sink down by ills o'erborne, Wasted and weariedâwrung and worn! Alas! it is with us even so, When we are crushed by Mortal Woe, When we are in our worst distress Who stops to sootheâto cheerâto bless? Doth then remain to us one friend To help or guideâto watch or tend?â No! all are hastening hurrying on, Forgetful of the stricken One. Each hath some darling hope in view, Some favourite object to pursue; All are urged on unto the close, Still lured by things that bar repose. In vain we breathe the imploring prayer, 'Tis lost in the unconscious air, In vain our suppliant hands we raise, And lift a long and yearning gazeâ No heart by that vain prayer is stirred, The feeble wail is scarcely heard, Amidst the unceasing din, and loud The clamour of the restless crowd! Back on our hearts that prayer is sent, And we with heavier grief are bent, Darker and darker frowneth round The iron doom wherein we're bound. Ah! cease complaint's fond cry to raise, He prays in vain who weakly prays For pity or for mercy here, They dwell within a distant sphere! Look round!âare all not hurrying on As some fair goal was to be won? All, all are wrapt in some dear dream, Devoted to some smiling schemeâ No time have they to spare for those Who faint beneath the weight of woes, And yet they might, could they foresee How useless their fond haste must be. Could they foresee their vain pursuit Should have but ashes for its fruit, For such, full oft becomes the fate Of those who strive with hope elate! But no! they may not this foreseeâ They gather from the uncertainty But keener hopesâbut wilder zeal Until their fate they haply seal! And they in turn are left behind With wounded heart and wearied mind, By those who still are lured along By hopes and passions deep and strong. And they deserted in their turn Feel how the stricken heart can burn, And in their turn they darkly know How bitter is the draught of woe. Then comes the anguish and the fear, And all is desolate and drearâ Awhile they struggle and they sigh, Then earthwards drawn they droop and die. But Oh! how proudly deeply blessed Am I on Earthâbeyond the restâ What joys must with my sorrows blend While thou art nearâmy Soul's own friend! That kind commiserating voice Can bid me even in grief rejoiceâ That dear consoling tone can charm Away from me each sterner harm. That pitying sympathizing sigh Can win me from despondency! And Oh! that smileâthat cheering smile Can half my woes at once beguile!â But when I see that brow of thine (Where but unclouded peace should shine!) For my sake darkened shadowed o'erâ For thy sake then I mourn no more! For much is still in our own powerâ (Through every varying trying hour) Of self command and self controul, And we full oft can rule the Soul! Find but a motive, deep and strong, And Passion's wild tumultuous throng Submits unto the yokeâthe chainâ Ev'n Passion's fierce and fiery train! And Sorrow's pale retinue too That pierce the wrung heart thro' and thro'. Unto subjection can be broughtâ And order and obedience taught. And Oh! can there a motive be More mighty than my love for thee, Which prompts the wish thy heart to spare From every dream of pain and care. It makes my very Happinessâ (Which most that generous heart can bless) Like a sweet sacred duty still That I am called on to fulfill. And happy, happy I must be, Loved of my Soul! when near to thee, Dire must the blow beâdark the grief, To which thy love brings no relief! MY THOUGHTS! ASCEND. VictoriouslyâVictoriously My rushing Thoughts! ascend, And cleave the Air and climb the Sky, And with the Sunlight blend. The imperial mysteries strive to sound Whose fountains are above The glorified, the illumed, the crowned, They may be pierced by Love! By Love whose reverential breath Is stilled down to a prayer, That Dove-like thingâyet strong as Death To braveâto brookâto bear! TriumphantlyâTriumphantlyâ My thoughts! from Earth ariseâ And soar into the opening Skyâ To a thousand opening Skies! For Height still stretcheth beyond Heightâ In endless glory thereâ And boundless are those Seas of Lightâ And realms of Golden Air! From World to Worldâfrom Sun to Sun There may ye shoot in mightâ While yet your flight but seems begun, Your space-devouring Flight! IllustriouslyâIllustriouslyâ In characters augustâ Trace ye along the Eternal Sky The triumphs of your trust! Your glorious aspirations writeâ Your towering hopes and fairâ As 'twere with Fire on flameless Lightâ With Wind on waveless Air! My Thoughts!â'midst Seraph ranks above Through zealous trust be found Crowned, glorified, and raised by Love, Though born on Mortal Ground. THE ISLE OF BEAUTY. Where glitters the Isle where the sunny tract glows, All baptized by the odours that drop from the rose, Where in Paradise-breathings the Southern-Wind blows So rich is the Soul of its sighs! Where laughs the sweet Isle that is washed by the wave, O'er whose silvery tremour no storm dares to rave, The olden Venus' bright haunt! the lost Sun-God's warm grave, Like some Star fallen away from the Skies! Lit up by the purple Heaven's mightiest of raysâ Yet tender the radiance, and softened the blaze! Oh! precious its nights areâand beauteous its days! LoveâLove!â'tis a realm meet for thee. A glad tumult of murmurs, through copse and flowered shade Speaks of life and of joyâall undimmedâundecayedâ And, melody-fraught, shakes each leaf of the glade, Like a faint moaning shell of the Sea. Where the orange-bowers all their fair treasures unfold, Till the grove hath a Star-light of red burning gold! Where in beautiful gloom stand the lone fanes of old, The fanes of the glorious dead! Where thrillingly low, sing the echo-voiced doves, Till musicâthe awakener!âruffles the grovesâ May blessings fall round ye! sweet Land of the Loves! May blessings around ye be shed! Yet is nothing but Beautyâand Beauty in bloom, In that young world of Sunshine and flowers and perfume, Ah! the Cypress grows there, as awaiting the tomb In darkness and silence it towers! Thus, thus whispers of Death pierce Earth's tumults of joy, All love and all lovelinessâstrong to destroy! And our life-cup hath there even its wormwood-alloy 'Mongst those Heaven-breathing exquisite bowers! THE FAREWELL TO EARTH. Must, must I die?-leave all I've loved or known, Possessed or cherishedâcalled and dreamed mine own?â This glad bright world, this laughing air and sky, This blessed home of loveâmust, must I die? Oh! beautiful hath life seemed unto me, Deathâhence! away! thou ghastly Mystery! Youth's flushing characters o'erpaint my cheek, Round my bright path the glitt'ring moments break In sudden star-showers, or soft vernal dews!â Till life but wears the rose's sumptuous hues;â My heart is borne on gusts of quivering joy, Must Fate its fervid happiness destroy? A power is given to wood and breezy hill, My Soul with gushing tenderness to fill; As magic poured through clouds, and leaves, and streams, Mantling with glory all my gladsome dreams; The very breeze is murmuring, âStay! Oh! stay!ââ A chain winds round me with each morning ray! How can I, poor, reluctant trembler, part From the beloved ones of my yearning heart?â How turn my lingering, aching sight away From the familiar glories of the dayâ Whilst Summer's breathings float so sweetly round, And morning's unisons of gladness sound? Even now warm Southern winds are faintly flowing Through answering leaves and flowers of June's bestowing; And Death is in the world, and on his way, Rushing like midnight in its haughty swayâ Unpitying 'mongst all gentle loving things, O'ersweeping all with his vast shadowy Wings! And thou, my home! thy dim and antique bowers, Must they no more, while glow noon's conquering hours, Shade me with woven veil of scented boughs, Through which no dazzling beam its pathway ploughs? Thy singing birds shall yet haunt each loved gloom, While I am in the dark unwhispering tomb! Even now their full victorious joy is swelling Through the green leafy precincts of my dwelling, Their glimmering colours glance along the air Like rainbow-fragments, quivering restless there; Far have ye journeyed, birds of Summer's sky, O'er Waste and Deep to bring rich melody. Far have ye journeyed! but my journeyings lone May not like yours, with starry joys be strown, To my green native Earth no hurrying back, On the Spring's glorious and exulting track; Alas! 'tis therefore with dejected eyes I mark the Queenly Morning's dawn and rise. Yet doth it haste towards cloudy vapourous Eve, No brilliant record, no bright trace to leave, Of all it hath been, so to mournful Eld My life will float if doom be now withheld; 'Tis o'er the grave the undying Mornings glowâ Triumphantly, though mournfullyâI go! A VISIT TO A COUNTRY HOUSE. Mrs. Marchmont! I'm charmed and delighted Your blooming good looks to remark, Ever since we were kindly invited, We've thought but of Easterwell Park! Pray allow me â my dear eldest daughter, I think you've ne'er seen her before, And my youngest besides I have brought her, 'Tis shameful though bringing the four For here is my sweet Araminta, Oh! you must make acquaintance with her, She came out but this very last winter, And caused some sensation and stir! And my lovely and gay Julianaâ Her I think you can hardly forgetâ You remarked on her mein and her manner When at Brighton last season we met. And my School-boyâyour kindness he shared not, But, alas! he's so wildly inclined, So rude and so roughâthat we dared not By any means leave him behind! I've another dear boy that's more steady, My poor Frederickâbut he's far away, You must know he's a gallant young middy That will grace his profession some day! His arrival indeed we're expectingâ You'll permit him to join us All here, The reunion will be most affectingâ For to all of us Freddy is dear. I am quite a weak fool about Freddy, Though he has some slight faults I must say, Since, although he's so good and so steady, From his ship he ran seven times away. He's a fine, frank, affectionate creatureâ All he has in the world he would giveâ And so generous and kind is his nature, That we must check its warmth; I believe. When on shoreâscarce the tale you will credidâ Twenty pounds from his father he stole, (Though this tale we would wish not to spread it) And spent on his sister the whole. For he purchased her earrings and necklace, (He had heard her admire much the set) And though may be, this was rather reckless, Such an act we can scarcely forget! As for William my youthful Collegian, He is studying most zealously now, But escaped from the classical region, He'll hasten to make you his bow. He will prove a companion delightful For your promising son I expect, And in general 'tis really quite frightful The friendships that young men select. My son's most distinguished and clever, Though a little too wild I allow, Since I grieve much to say he's for ever Engaged in some riot or row. He's too fond too of drinking and gambling, But 'tis natural and right at his age!â One must pardon a little wild rambling, I like not to see young men too sage. I don't doubt he'll amend soon his livingâ But at present his passions are play, Slang, cock-fighting, boxing, and driving, But he'll soon change his course, I dare say! To the turf too he's strangely devoted, I wish there was no turf at all! My brother too much on it doated, To the ruin of Rantriot Hall! Willy last week a watchman assaulted, And for this was imprisoned and finedâ But most dignified still and exalted Is he, both in his manners and mind! He's too easily led on by others, From whence these slight weaknesses come, Full of spirit too just like his brothers, And for faultsâwe have all of us some! Your son can't do better than make him His bosom companion and friend, As his model I trust he will take him, On his worth he may firmly depend! For the light venial errors I've mentioned, To that worth they but serve as a foil, He's well principled, soundly intentioned, I but fear the world's homage will spoil! One so full of all talent and spirit, So superior and shining as he, Must be courted and prized for his merit, And the Idol of thousands must be! I am told his young friend, my Lord Burten, Now cuts himâsheer envy no doubtâ Yes! 'tis malice and envy I'm certain, Just because my dear boy cuts himâout! To be sure they do say he's delightful, The best brother and son ever known, But he must be most horridly spitefulâ Since he thus doth my Willy disown. For a time they were sworn friends, believe me, And for nothing Lord Burten turned round, (So said Willy, who ne'er would deceive me) And a friend more congenial soon found. I suspect the youth's too strict and rigid, (Besidesâenvious of William's great powers!) He looks odiously formal and frigid! I am glad he is no son of ours! May I ask who you have here at present? I was told young Lord Glasville was here, Oh! I'm sure we shall find it so pleasant You will tempt us to stay half the year! Not a word, my dear friend!âI assure you 'Tis no flatteryâOh! no, not a bit, Why, my Julia, this fine air will cure you Of the small-pox you've scarcely lost yet. Nay, pray don't be alarmed, my dear Lady! You see she is scarce marked at all, Indeed, our friend Doctor O'Brady Saidâthose slight marks all hearts would enthrall, That they suited her air and complexion, And gave an additional charm, And agreed with her looks to perfection, And indeed there's no ground for alarm. Yes! I see you're afraid of infection, But I'm sure nothing bad will befall, Though I own 'tis my rooted conviction Vaccination's of no use at all. All my faith in it now's gone for ever, 'Tis a weak superstitious vain charm, I can never again trust itânever, Do just look at the mark on her arm. She'd this cow-pox before she could prattle, And of small-pox I ne'er had a fear, Though my sister with me had a battle When she heard the disease was so near! It was brought from the town by some strangerâ The town near to where we resideâ And I own I ne'er thought of the danger, Her maid caught it from her and died! So they saidâwhich does sound rather fearfulâ 'Twas a bad and most virulent sort, But we can but be watchful and careful, In case of its spreadingâin short Have your daughters ne'er had it? believe me If I'd guessed this, she should not have come, But I knew when you said you'd receive me, You ne'er meant I should leave her at home. I was really afraid Araminta Was sickening of it to-day, Not the least ray of colour did tint her Sweet cheekânot the least faintest ray. And at breakfast her appetite failed her, She ate but one small slice of toast, Then I truly did think something ailed her, And she looked yet more pale than a ghost! If she should take this dreadful disorder, What medical men have you near? Ah! they'll prove of inferior order To our Doctor O'Brady I fear! And alas! for my poor Araminta, The season's against her beside, She'll be laid up here, all the whole Winter,â 'Tis provokingâit can't be denied! But we'll hope that these symptoms deceive us, And if not 'twill but be common sense In your house for some months then to leave us, And to take your whole family hence! If we keep well, 'twill be most enchanting, Our daughters such great friends will growâ And we all for so long have been panting To pay you this Visit you know. 'Tis a sacrifice, doubtless, we're making, Such a very long distance to come, The opportunity though we are taking Of effecting improvements at home! Our house wanted great alterations, 'Tis now thoroughly under repair, From the roof to the very foundations It required much revision and care. We shall have to pull down, to my sorrow, And rebuild the chief partsâand dear friend, If my husband, constrained is to borrow, Mr. Marchmont, I'm certain, will lend! 'Tis a very expensive proceedingâ And a tiresome process indeed, And to new expense, still, it is leading, The more done, the more seems still to need! And the time that 'twill take in rebuilding!â I begin in real earnest to fear, What with painting, whitewashing, and gilding, At the very least, 'twill be a year!â Then there's furnishing too, in addition! We shall never get through in the year! I half fear we must make our petition That you'll let us stay all the time here! Oh! No, prayâyou're so kind and so pressing, I must turn a deaf ear to you nowâ Your entreaties are really distressing, No!âno!âI'll not listenâI vow!â I hate nothing so much as encroaching, No!âI cannot stay on quite so long; And the season for hunting's approaching, When I know your friends muster here strong! Well, indeed, if you'll take no denial, I suppose I must yield with good grace, But believe me, to me 'tis a trial, Although 'tis quite a singular case! I'm convinced that on Earth there's no creature That hates burthening my friends as I do, It is quite my remarkable feature, And no doubt you've discovered 'tis true! 'Tis most grievous, afflicting, and odious, And I ever avoid it with care, Howe'er it may be incommodious, 'Tis a thing that I never could bear! Some people you see go on staying, Where you're sure they're not wanted at all, Daily still their departure delaying, I have known it at Ragtatter Hall. But I never would bear or endure it, 'Tis too shameful and shocking you knowâ And there is but one way left to cure it, To say that yourself you must go. But now I must just ask you whether My room to my girls' rooms is near, We must all be placed quite close together, Though 'twill prove rather puzzling I fear. And will probably be inconvenient, (Since your House does not seem over large!) But pray do be indulgent and lenient! Four daughtersâthey are such a charge! I do hate from my girls to be distantâ With sad fears it at once fills my mind, (I may say I'm in all things consistent, As whilst I stay here you will find!) My poor husband is terribly gouty, But he swears that the air of this place Makes him sound now, and vigourous, and doughty, And ready to join in the chase! As we came here we met the hounds running, And his joy he could scarcely contain, And though hunting he long has been shunning, I think now, he'll take to it again. His great weight was, poor man, the chief reason That made him forsake it before, He has ceased not with each circling season His sad heavy case to deplore! But he killed all his horses for ever, And 'twas ruinous quite you may think, But for this I am sure he would never From a sport he's devoted to, shrink! I ne'er saw him yet look so delighted As when swept the hounds past in full cry, 'Twas alarmingâhe seemed so excited, That I thought in a fit he would die. Mr. Marchmont I doubt not will mount him The best of his hunters uponâ And perhaps they will yet have to count him As the first in some capital run! He will never give in, I can tell you, Mr. Marchmontâmark me he'll be first, And despite his vast weight will excel you, And show you the way in a burst! I am told that your stud is quite splendid, So you'll lend him a hunter each dayâ By the time that the season is ended He will grow a light weight I daresay Oh! dear!âOh! my goodness!âgood gracious!â Why, Johnny! now what have you done?â I declare it is deeply vexatious, Oh! do look at my mischievous son! He has brought out our monkey!âhow shocking! (I had given him to Jane in strict charge) And your china about he's been knockingâ Why how dared you, sir, set him at large? In the carriage I left him chained closely, Since this monkey's a mischievous elf, And now you have thus loosed him jocosely, Why indeed you're as bad as himself. Oh! dear Madamâpray do not go near himâ He will bite you to death if you do!â I have excellent reason to fear him, For he once bit my arm through and through. Now what is to be done?âJuliana! Ring the bellâwhat a noise he does make, Oh! don't stand there and stare in that manner, Or that fine Dresden set he will break! What a clattering and chatteringâ'tis horrid, Mrs. Marchmont has fainted away, Eau de Cologne!âquick! quick! bathe her foreheadâ Araminta! my salts bottle, pray! There's the clock gone!âI tremble all over!â Oh! here are the servantsâat lastâ Mrs. Marchmont will quickly recover, Her colour is coming back fast! Ah! what havoc!âhow dire a disaster, I am grieved beyond all I can sayâ Yet I hope that both mistress and master In the house will let poor Jacko stay! As for you, Johnny, go! I desire youâ You more mischievous monkey! begoneâ For effrontery we all must admire you, Leave my presenceâI order you, John! Now that riotous boy has departed, We can hear our own voices once more; Mrs. Marchmont, you're too tender hearted, No! such conduct I cannot pass o'er! And you, too, you so nervous and frightened! It was enough to destroy you outright, But I see that your eye now has brightened, So I trust you'll recover the fright! I am sure your head must be distracted, Such a sad invalid as you are! How outrageously Johnny has acted, I could swoon away now I declare! Ere this strange interruption so frightful, I was going to impart a new plan, Which indeed would be truly delightfulâ We must bring it about if we can! Anne, my dear married daughter, has lately Had twinsâlovely creatures they say, Now to meet, would rejoice us all greatly, Do then send and invite her here pray! I am dying to see the sweet treasures, And without them of course she won't come, I do hope you will quickly take measures To tempt her to bring them from home! She is very domestic and quiet, (She's afflicted with deafness you know) But I think were she only to try it, Very fond of the World she would grow! So ask her and her babies I pray you, I feel sure you will doat on them quite, And a charming long visit they'll pay you, Do write off the letter to-night! Miss Marchmont, I hope you speak German, Araminta does speak it so well, I can tell you she'll read you a sermon If she finds that you do not excel! All my daughters have endless resources, Any mother in them might feel pride; By the wayâhave you good Ladies' horses? For all of them charmingly ride! I assure you they're perfect equestrians, They want nothing but horses indeed, But perhaps you are only pedestrians, Young ladiesâand shrink from a steed! All my girls are accomplished and clever, And their minds with deep knowledge are stored, They are thought acquisitions wherever I take them with meâon my word! They are subtle and sound Politicians, And in arguments close are oft tried, And so sweet are their meek dispositions, They oft argue against their own side! For myself, I was ne'er a great talker, But quite the reverseâam I not? Oh! I think I forgotâhere's Miss Walkerâ Lucy's GovernessâYes! I forgot. You will find her most pleasing and charming, I rejoice in presenting her now;â But indeed it is truly alarming, Your cheek grows so pale, and your brow! 'Tis that horrible monkey's mischances That you cannot get over, I'm sure, When your eye at that shattered clock glances, It brings back all you've had to endure! By the bye, it would suit us completely If you would but lend Julia your harp, For she plays very finely and sweetly, Though she ne'er knows a flat from a sharp. Her ear is most sadly deficient, But that signifies little, they say, She in truth is a perfect proficient, Every night she shall sing here and play! As for Lucy, she's but a beginner, But she practises muchâI believe!â Will you let us up stairs have our dinner, If 'tis not too much trouble to give. Let us see what o'clock 'tisâOh! shocking! I forgot the poor clock's dismal plightâ It might seem your mishap I was mocking, Which would ill become meâWell! Good night! CHANGES. It was a brilliant Summer's day, Unclouded shone the Sunny ray, And gaily sang the feathered throng, The air was all one gush of Song! Oh! smiling was that day and fair, The Rose burnt dark upon the air, 'Twas so transparent and so clear, And not a wreath of cloud was near. The Rose burnt dark upon the air, (So silvery glancing 'twas and rare)â The Atmosphere around ev'n blushed, Rose! with thy glorious shadows flushed. Ah! glorious is the Rose full blown, All Beauty in its form is shown! The South and all its Sun-gifts seem Burnt into its deep core, to beam.â Burnt deep into its deepest heart, Not to decline or to depart!â Yet, Ah! how soon in pale decay The Rose of Beauty fleets away! Methought âno, never yet on Earth So bright a day has leaped to birth, Never have Earth and Heaven and Air Yet been so beauteous and so fair!â The scene had found in mine own Soul To smile back its enchanted whole, A mirror stainless and serene That flung new glory o'er that scene. For every beauty, clear, and fair, Redoubled seemed and deepened there, Another Heavenâanother Earth There quickened into radiant birth. Oh! many a lovely Summer's day Hath shone forth since with smiling sway, But not o'er me their power retained, The mirror shattered is and stained! No longer spreads it smooth and clear, The Heavensâthe Earthâtherein appear But mighty Ruinsâchanged and crushed, O'er which a storm-black cloud hath rushed. And wherefore?âwhence this change so dire, Ah! little boots it to enquire, Submit in patient silence stillâ My Soulâand all thy fate fulfill! TO ? I saw thee once, thou fair and lovely thing, And trembled for theeâsuch rich gifts will bring Upon thy fearless and uplifted head, Those storms of fate, whose terrors still seem spread Around the loveliest and the best below, In this probationary State of Woe.â I trembled for thee-but I trembled more Because I saw thy brow of Beauty bore The certain stamp of feelings too refined, Yeaâof too quick a heartâtoo deep a mind. Those dark eyes streamed with overburthening thought, That clear smooth cheek was all too richly fraught With the warm lightâthe varying troubled lightâ Of kindling Passion-blushes strangely brightâ That came and wentâreceded now, now rushed With deeper glow, till thy whole aspect blushed! I trembled for theeâSince too well I know What thou art surely doomed to undergo In this dark theatre of wrath and strife, This World of trialsâthis o'ershadowed Lifeâ To natures sensitive as thineâhow stern Shall seem those lessons, all that live must learn How bitter those beginnings of distrust Which must be felt, by all whose life is dust!â And then, and now, I felt and feel too muchâ Most keenlyâthat Fate harshly deals with suchâ Aye! such as thouâthy very charms appear To mark thee out for a bright Victim hereâ Apparelled proudly as with zealous care, With costly pompâas other Victims are. Oh! Sorrow singles out things fair as thou, With Beauty's living halo round their brow, 'Mongst her sad train of tearful gloom to beâ And 'mongst her pale and silent company, Thou may'st be loved, fair matchless thing, thou must, But not in love may Woman place her trust; Thou must be loved, but Oh! that very love (While thy warm heart shall deeply learn to prove Responsive passion) may for thee become The worst infliction and the darkest doom. Thou must be loved, all beauteous as thou art, Thou must be worshipped, as a thing apart, An idol and a treasureâbut alas!â That wildest warmest love may wane and pass, Not ev'n Perfection can its truth secure In this dim life where things infirm, impure, Mingle with all of noblest and of best, Until too often they corrupt the restâ And then, what anguish shall that heart subdue, So quick, so warm, so feeling, and so true? What fearful pangs shall pierce that lovely mind, So tenderly and faultlessly refined? How shall thine own deep feelings darkly grow The truest source of suffering and of woe? And all thy fair endowments, all thy powers But make more torturing those long wasting hours Of heart-sick cold suspense, or blighting fear, Or pale despair that cannot shed a tear, Till even thy richest gifts shall seem to be The heaviest portion Fate hath stored for thee, 'Twas thoughts like these, that crowded on my mind When first I saw thee artless yet refined, Gentle but stately in thy lofty grace, With all thy Soul of Beauty in thy face, I trembled for thee then and turned away, Lest that I might those mournful thoughts betrayâ I trembled for thee thenâI tremble now! But to recall that bright and beaming brow, That kindled earnest eye too much inspÃ­red, With rays too ardent and too restless firedâ That glowing cheek whose quick rich blushes past In dazzling change, each lovelier than the last, Must make me sighing tremble for thee still With sad prophetic bodings, deep and chill, All makes the Heart fear for the future doom Of one so lovely with Love's dangerous bloom. Oh! Earth, how dark, how mournful, must thou be, Where thus we sigh and tremble, but to see The fairest and most beauteous things that smile Thy gloom away, and light thee for awhile. While thus we sigh, and shudder, but to look On forms too fair thy stormy hours to brook, And turn from smiling Loveliness away To weep o'er coming ruin's certain day. THE ONLY CHARM. I said unto myself of old Now weakling heartâbe strongâor still, Arm thyself wellâbe calm and cold, Forget to bound, to heave, and thrill. A dangerous thing it is to have A heart so wild, so warm as mine, I deemed I could all perils brave, And hope and love and fear resign. I deemed so, and forbore to shrink In time from all I most should shun, Still hovering near the flower-dressed brink Till heart and hope were both undone. For Oh! with feelings keen and warm, So keen and warm as mine then were, The only guard, the only charm Is flightâ'tis flight alone can spare! For through suspense and through alarm, Which haunt us in Life's clouded night, The only guard, the only charm, The only safetyâis in flight! I CAN BUT SAYâI LOVE! Some, some may pour their passion forth In words of rich and feeling worth, And well express and well explain The rapture of that costly pain, And wreak on utterance strong the wholeâ Of that sweet madness of the Soul, And pity raise and feeling moveâ And IâI can but sayâI love! Oh! some in Inspiration's tone May make their deep emotions knownâ And lofty argument and high Build on their heart's idolatry, And breathe with burning words of fire Thoughts, Passion's Soul might well respire, And soar to starry heights aboveâ And IâI can but sayâI love! Some may, with full and gushing strains, Dwell on Love's pleasures and his pains, Discoursing with elaborate art On the rich secrets of the Heart, Pourtraying with consummate skill Each precious throbâeach priceless thrillâ And paint the Passion that they proveâ And IâI can but sayâI love! With streams of glowing eloquence, With fervid language, and intense, Some may to all the World, proclaim The ardour of their bosom's flame, And Strike-strike with hand of fire the chords, And weave a dazzling web of words, (Subtle as those Arachne wove) While IâI can but sayâI love! I can but say I loveâbut sigh That sweet truth forth all faulteringlyâ And if I could I would not seek The secret of my Soul to speak! Oh! all who truly love must feel Weak language faileth to reveal Such Passion as the Impassioned proveâ And thenâthey can but sayâthey love! Howe'er the eloquent may strive, 'Tis but the outlines that they give Of that deep Truth whose founts amid The Soul's own living depths lie hid; Oh! never mortal tongue shall tell The mystery indescribableâ Then still let me, and let the dove, In murmurs breatheââI loveâI love!â INDIFFERENCE. Indifferenceâin some mood of pride For thee full often have I sighed, And deemed Life's happiest moments were Ev'n those that owned no love-born care. And now against suspense I railed, By which the trembling heart assailed, Through every pulse feels keener life, Wrought to one agony of strife! And now 'gainst racking jealousy (With scorching tear and choaking sigh) That hoard up poisons evermore As doth the bee its honeyed store! And now 'gainst blushing shrinking shame That dares not own the heav'n-born flame, But dwells in silent fear apart With the whole burthen at her heart! And still 'gainst these I railedâand prayed That thou wouldst come unto mine aid, Indifferenceâwith thy healing balm, Thy dreamless restâthy breathless calm. But when I sought indeed to move Free from the fettering power of Loveâ How beautifulâhow bright I found The chain wherewith my Soul was bound. Even these worst pangs of fevered pain That shot like fire through breast and brain, And racked me with a restless fear, I felt as Life itself were dear. Like jewels on a dazzling chain That each doth Sunlight-hues retain, Seemed those rich Sorrows then to be, And could I still wish to be free? With none could I resolve to part, Oh! wavering weak and yielding heart, Each pang was precious, and my pride In the unequal struggle died! The vain and foolish dream is flown, Oh! FeelingâI am all thine own, Indifference! hateful, hated state, Away!âI fling thee from my Fate! SWEET NIGHTINGALE. The throbbing music of that throat, How softly doth it swell and float, Lend me, Oh! lend me that dear note, Sweet Nightingale! While thou so richly dost complain, Surely that Heavenly, heavenly strain Must soothe, must turn to joy thy pain, Sweet Nightingale! Oh! that it might be so with me, But gloomy is my minstrelsie, And bids my sufferings sharper be, Sweet Nightingale! For we but ransack Nature still For chords that may responsive thrill To our own bosom's aching ill, Sweet Nightingale! Whilst thouâthe voice which Nature gave Sufficeth thus from Grief to save, Thou hear'st thyselfânor more dost crave, Oh! Nightingale! Nature the eternal balm supplies, Thou sing'stâJoy livesâand Sorrow diesâ If in thy breast the famed thorn liesâ Poor Nightingale! But surely 'twas a fable all, Thy little heart owns no dull thrall, No shadow o'er thy life doth fall, Sweet Nightingale! Ah! surely Bird, no thorn is there, We seek an echo everywhere, For our own sigh of human care, Sweet Nightingale! And then by chance we make our choice Of some beloved and blessed voiceâ Haply thy song but saith, Rejoiceâ Oh! Nightingale! THE CAPTIVE'S SONG. The Captive wailed, in mournful strain, And sought to pour his bosom's pain, From out its burthened stifled core, In words of sadness evermore. The voice of his own bitter grief Afforded him a faint reliefâ Though words may not unfold, at least They shroud the sufferings of the breast! And thus he poured his song of woeâ Oft broken by faint sighs and low, And Pity's self had paused to hear Ere she had checked a strain so dear. If ever Freedom may be mine on this broad Earth againâ A glorious recompense shall be the guerdon of my pain, For I have learned and deeply too and well to feel and know How precious Joy and Freedom are while I have wept in woe. Of old I gazed all carelessly upon the Earth and Air, Nor saw the gracious glories and the boundless beauty there, Though thousand lovely things were round, scarce, scarce I heeded these, Now could I prize the lightest leaf that trembles to the breeze. The flowers that gild the ground should seem like Stars of Heav'n to me, And Oh! those Stars divine, say, what then, what should they not be? WorldsâWorlds of Beautyâwhere my thought on Angel wings might soar, And with a holier rapture thrill than ere they did before. And wheresoe'er mine eye might rove, my liberated eye, Or on this beauteous Earth below or in the beaming Sky, There should my very Soul look forth, and make the scene its own, And seize unnumbered new delights it ne'er before hath known. The Universe belongs to those who grasp it and who claim, And if its empire be not ours, ours surely is the blame, Each Being born into the World receiveth from that hour The wide World for his appanage, Creation for his dower! Since to the conscious eyes that see, and to the ears that hear, Heaven gives the treasures of the whole, howe'er it may appear, Not he is blest who saith, âbehold! the gold and gems are mine,â But he who most delighteth still in their resplendent shine! Sharp Sorrow and Captivity have well my Spirit taught, How all this wond'rous World below with wealthiest gifts is fraught, For me if e'er I break my chain, the Lord of Light and Day Shall burn in the illumined Sky with a redoubled ray, And monarchs, monarchs shall be poor, the captive freed beside, For richer than the richest he, who claims Creation wide, And Creosus were a bankrupt near the master of that mine Which teemeth with exhaustless storesâo'erflowing Natureâthine! Then shall I feel mine own freed eye an empire can command, Oh! talk not of the Student's lore nor of the Enchanter's wand, We need but look, and all is lightâbut ask, and all is ours, Since Heaven hath given us Senses armed with all-sufficient Powers. And thus, poor Captive, may it be indeed With us, when from our Mortal fetters freedâ We may be taught in this uncertain life, So dark with sorrow, and so wild with strife, With deeper ecstacy of bliss to prize The Freedom and the Glory of the Skiesâ Even Heaven may brighten with redoubled light To these who long have mourned in Earth's dense Night. DEPARTED JOYS. We toil along this weary heavy Waste With our best joys left in the darkened Past Far, far behindâOh! what wild grief, what pain This draught of fire which yet we oft must drain, The thought that never more can be our own, The dearest hopes and pleasures we have known, For these are still the earliestânor can bear The lightest breath of Life's more bitter air, When doubt and sin, suspense and freezing fear Make these fair leaves of fragrance pale and sere, Those fair but frailest flowers, their life was done Soon as one cloud came floating o'er the Sunâ Our after joys are hardierâand can dare The unkindly breath of this World's blighting air, And ev'n survive the shock of storms, perchance, If yet from time to time one golden glance Down from the Sun of Hope enkindling shoots, To warm them to their deep embedded rootsâ But Oh! though fitted to our trying fate, They are not dear as those more delicateâ Those tenderer and more fragile ones that fade If but one moment thrown into the shade, They are the treasured of the Soul, the dear Beyond all others that may bless us here. And Oh! the thought that they ne'er come again Is as a draught of fire which we must drain In sadness and in sorrow evermoreâ That thrill and rankle in the heart's sick core. Memory, forbear to bring them thus in viewâ The retrospective eye which tears bedew Hails them too fondly, faithfully for peaceâ Oh! Memoryâbut thy persecutions cease, Nor come with cruel keenness, to remind How bright these joys were, which are left behind, Which never more can gladden us below, And whose remembrance makes our weal seem woe, Our present weal, so poor with that compared, Which in those hours of rainbow-light we shared! When all was transportâmystery of delightâ And all was ecstacy to Soul and Sightâ Oh! leave us to the Present, let us cling To each consoling and each cherished thing, Nor turn distracted ev'n from Hope away, Because less bright than on a former day, Our present pleasures were enough, could we Forget but those that dwell in Memory. Farther and farther must we pass from those Ere yet we come indeed unto the close, But yet they sadly shine out to the last, And shed their mournful Beauty o'er Life's waste, While all our other joys in turn decay, And leave but graceless wrecks to strew our way; Those earliest, loveliest, happiest, dearest, best, Assert their gentle sway above the restâ And make our yearning Spirits long once more To feel that freshness which they felt before, That glow of confidence, that hush of peace, That buoyant energy in glad increase, Which bore them onwards as with wings of fire, That could not cease to soarâthat could not tire, At least so deemed they, but in vain, in vain, They faultering fellâand not to rise again! But when the weary time indeed is o'er, The time of tears and sighs and sufferings soreâ The Soul shall then regain its long lost youth, Its strength, its calm, its confidence, and truthâ And joys more pure know then, than it may know It its first bloom of young delight below! MINE IS A GRIEF. Mine is a Grief that time shall scarce make less, It is indeed a dark and dire distress, When Thoughts and Feelings strangely still at strife, Divide us in the Deep of our own Life! These struggling upwards to their native home, And those abiding by their Mortal doom, So the Soul's deepest depths are roused and stirred, And war for such war were too weak a word! Oh! heavy, hopeless, and profound distress, It is indeed the worst of lonelinessâ This solitude of separate Thoughts and Wills, Which with strange doubts the haunted Spirit fills; Aye! lonely 'tis in self-division thus When 'gainst ourselves ourselves grow mutinous, Whenâin the centre of the living Soul Betwixt our Hopes, such waves, such oceans roll!â When we are parted with mysterious power, Even self from self through Life's long torture-hour As but this inborn feud of Feeling partsâ That plants a Death within our heart of hearts! It is indeed the dreariest loneliness, The sharpest strife, the deepest worst distress, When Thoughts and Feelings with unnatural strife Divide us in the Deep of our own Life! THE FADING IMAGE. Oh! loved as thou art lovelyâto excessâ Why dost thou leave me to this long distress, This agony of absenceâwhich destroys All hope, and leaves but memory of past joys. O'er thy remembered Image still I hang, It is a pleasure, yet too like a pangâ And in my heart of hearts I watch to trace The Beauty of thy Form and of thy Face. But fainter grows that Image day by day, Not that my love is fainterâbut dismay, And doubt, and weariness, and grief, and dread, A cloud of gloom o'er brain and spirit spread. Not that my love is fainterâOh! not so, Its deepest life seems fed by thoughtful woe, But Memory's skill is weakened by distressâ All is confusionâall is bitterness. Yes! hopelessness hath fallen with heavy chill On Memory's earnest zeal and marred her skill, A deadly languor, cold and dull and slow, Hath checked and palsied every effort now! I see that Image darkening day by day, And fading, passing, mournfully away, I seek to arrest it still, the power is gone! The Eternal effort hath itself undone! Return! Oh! but return to me againâ Give me thyselfâand banish fear and painâ 'Stead of this faded Image shadowed o'erâ Give me the bright Original once more! AND SHALL I LONGER BEND AND BOW? And shall I longer bend and bow Beneath a blighted doom, Nor seek to lift from off my life This pall of crushing gloom? Why, Night herself boasts Worlds of light, Her frowning Vault to paveâ And roses too are scattered o'er The stern and shadowy Grave. And shall unbroken darkness spread Around me evermore? No! though the dearest hopes be fled That blessed my Soul before. Ah! Sunny World, thou'rt still as bright, As smiling still art thou, As when reflected was thy smile From my once stainless brow! And clouds have liberty above, And restless birds below, While I am prisoned in my pain, And wound about with woe! But let me now make others' joys Unenvyingly mine ownâ And try once more to taste the bliss Which I before have known! For Oh! in this wide Sunny World Deep bliss abideth still, And they may taste that bliss and share, Who strive with steadfast will. And much there is to snatch and glean, If we but know the wayâ And let the glorious light pour in Upon our clouded day. Joyâjoy is scattered far and wide O'er all this Earthly scene, And they may rest in peace and hope Who long have mourners been. If but of the Universal Feast These to partake consent, Not on a single separate bliss With selfish spirit bent! Yes! I will dash this cloud away, And fling this gloom asideâ 'Twas not a hopeless fate that crushedâ 'Twas selfishness and pride. THE RETURN TO ENGLAND. White Cliffs of England! there ye stand, Like Angel-watchers round The one beloved and beauteous Land, Our Hearts' own Holy ground. White Cliffs of England! robed in light, Your precious charge ye hold, Dazzling the gazer's gladdened sight, Now topped with Sunlight's gold. White Cliffs of England!âRocks of Home! I hail your sacred heightsâ Crowns ye the Sky like some bright dome That loveth what it lights! White Cliffs of England!âRocks of Home! I greet you with Love's tears, To ye shall slave and stranger come To count auspicious years. Cliffs of my Country's glorious shores! Her Ocean bathes your baseâ And forth its mighty challenge roars, That echoeth strong through Space! Cliffs of my Country! do ye stand Round Paradise restoredâ A white-robed Guardian Angel band, Without the threatening sword?â White Cliffs of England! ye might seem That Heavenly Host sublime Of Cherubimâwhile thus ye gleamâ To shadow forth to Time! FIREFLIES AT MILAN. Bright lovely things, Like Stars on wings, Ye daze the eye Thus flashing by. Ev'n brief as bright, Your lifeâyour light Not long may last, Their prime soon past! But that is nought, Things free as Thought!â To ye who know Nor fear, nor woe! Beyond this hour Ye have no power To lookâbright thingsâ Like Stars on wings! In your mid-joy No dull alloy Its truth to bound Can e'er be foundâ While free ye play Each seems a ray With life instinct, With rapture linked! Shot from the Sun, In joy begun, In joy as true, Completed too. Oh! revellers bright! Your Life is Light!â Ye breatheâand blazeâ Like quickened rays! TO PAIN. Why, what is Life but thee! triumphant Pain? Vast is thy power and endless is thy reign, Life seems but one Illusion wild and strange, One mystery of perplexity and change; Illusion?âAye! its hopes, joys, blessings all, But none, stern Pain, shall thee Illusion call, Thou bleak and black yet blank Reality, The veriest sceptic cannot doubt of thee, The mightiest Conqueror can controul thee not, Thou art the ruler of our Earthly lotâ Lawgivers are thy SubjectsâKings thy Slavesâ Philosophers thy foolsâstaid Wisdom raves Like babbling ideotcy on thy keen rack, When all thy murderous train are at thy back, Twin-Empires hast thouâthou hast Kingdoms twain, Oh! thou Earth-desolating Power of Painâ The sentient Frameâthe conscious Soul of man, And these have been thine own since Life began; By the most thoughtless art thou ne'er forgot, Sovereign of Lifeâchief Sovereign of our lot, Thou art the known, felt, Truthâthe Certainty, The touchstone of Existence, since to thee The keenest sense of Being still we owe, Thro' thee, thro' thee, our deepest powers we knowâ Capacites of suffering still transcend The rest by far, and have no bound nor end, He who becomes thy prey at once he lives A life, that Nature at our birth ne'er givesâ An animated Universe of strife Grows his extended and enlarging life, Without a bourneâillimitably wide, By torture's deadly mystery magnified A Chaos of quick consciousnessâintense With every nerve o'erwrought, and every sense A Chaos, whose black discord and whose war Where all things join and only join to jarâ Shall ne'er in harmony and order closeâ From ruin and destruction 'tis it grows! A Chaos not of Hope but of Despair, With stern perdition, but no promise there! A Chaos of inextricable Ill That shall remain a barren Chaos still, And this is thy vile workâthou ruthless Pain, Dark uncreator!âwith too wide a reign! Death, like an Angel, smileth by thy side, We court him, as the bridegroom might the bride, And pant to rest within that quiet grave, Whose sleep from all thine agonies shall save, Thou Spirit-crushing Powerâall-dreaded Pain, Who wide dost spread thine undisputed reign O'er this still groaning and ill fated Earth, Which, but for thee, gives all her children birth. But art thou then, the Ruler over all, Do all indeed stoop meekly to thy thrall? Dost thou indeed such boundless sway exert, Wide, wide o'er th' Universal Frame and Heartâ The helpless Frame to thee must ofttimes yield, But boasts the Heart no shelter and no shield? Oh! most unworthy thoughtâit is not so, (Though vast in truth thy Empire spreads below)â But Hope, but Faith, but Fortitude, and Love, How oft have these thine influence towered above, And taught thee in thy turn an humbler moodâ Faced, dared, confronted, challenged, and subdued!â Thou wring'st the quivering nerves with fiendish art, Till very Life appears to come and part At thy stern will, as though at hideous strife With threat'ning Deathâor e'en as Death and Life At once were shut within the sufferer's Soul, Disputing inch by inch the tortured wholeâ Tornâriven between themâto its centre wrung With every pang of every anguish stung, Or through that Soul thou driv'st thy deadlier fangs, Not throes corporeal but keen mental pangs. And yet that Soul at times hath nobly been Even in such strife in its own self serene!â In its own self thus martyred and thus made A scene of ghastly wasteâin ruins laid! And while all Earthly hope was snatched away, And every feeling thy defenceless prey, It hath exulted in the holier trust, Which buildeth not its bulwarks of the dustâ And ev'n the fleshly Form when armed, inspiredâ By that All-conquering Soul's proud impulse fired, Can strengthen its strong nerves and suffer less, Though pang on pang to assail it still may press, And may e'en fortify itself with zeal That half forbids the unshrinking flesh to feel, For sure to shun and to resist is still But to aggravate the antagonizing Ill! To arm it 'gainst ourselvesâwhile nerve by nerve Doth shuddering shrink away, and shivering swerve, First from the upcoiled contraction must they be Torn, wrenched perforce in quivering agony, Then by the mastering throes that crowd in thick, Pierced, wrung, and thrilled unto the tortured quick! But when the Victim dares to meet those throes Half way, at once their keenest power they lose, The quickened blood bears strength thro' ev'ry part, Nor curdles sickening round the withering heartâ The mindâthe mind can blunt Pain's deadliest sting, And teach the flesh to brave its sufferingâ 'Tis as the etherealizedâth' exalted Frame Part of the immortal Spirit then becameâ Behold Oh! Pain, thy dark and direful sway Disputed thus in Nature's last decay, By vigourous spirits that know not to bend, But strive and struggle nobly to the end! I call thee now no more the unconquered Power, Though many yield in thy destructive hourâ Our Human Nature can thy might defy, When keen roused energies their strength supply, Pain! countless rebels rise against thy reign, And challenge thee and all thy fearful trainâ Affection mocks thee, and Repentance craves, The Martyr loves thee, and the Savage braves. THE HEART'S HOPE. My heartâapart Still watchâto snatch Hope's smile awhile, The fairâthe rare From sighs arise, Forget regret, Disdain thy pain, Repress distressâ Hope's light shines bright For all who call Without weak doubt On her, nor errâ Nor make mistake, Nor deem a dream Her scene, whose sheen Seems given from Heaven! That light spread bright In love above Our Worldâclose furled In gloom, one tombâ Didst thou, ev'n now Oh! Hope! faint droopâ And shun the Sunâ Nor throw thy glow Thus even, o'er Heaven, Nor deign thy train To bringâand fling O'er Day a rayâ A gleam supreme! Heart, heart, apart Now watch to snatch That smile, whose wile Can charm from harm, Can win from sin, Make fear appear A thoughtâa noughtâ Idealâunreal, And still with skill Complete, most sweet The thought, o'erfraught With dreamsâvain schemesâ (And woes that rose To o'ercloud and shroud The mind, resigned To bear with care)â Soothe down and crown With blaze of rays That shine divine. My heart, now part With fear, take cheerâ Be strongâfor wrong Are they who say 'Tis vain 'gainst pain To striveâto drive Away dismayâ Is't so?ânoânoâ Proud Powers are ours Would we but be Unbowed and proudâ And choose to use Those powers in hours Of gloom and doom.â Now heart, that art So weakâor break, Or rise from sighsâ And scorn to mournâ Even so thy Woe, Disdain, and Pain!â And dare Despair! Oh! meet and greet, So face Disgrace, 'Twill melt unfelt If thou but now At length in strength Defyâdenyâ Nor deign the chain To wearâthe snare For thee shall be Ne'er set, though yet 'Twere well to dwell Girt round and bound With zealâto steel Thy coreâonce sore With grief, and chief To clingâfaint thing! To rocks which shocks Of waves when raves The gale, must fail To rend or bend, To break or shake!â No shocks those rocks Shall make to quake!â Seas flow below, Storm-scourgedâfierce urged In foam to comeâ While death and wrath Abound, aroundâ But Oh! below If we can be But taughtâbut brought At last to cast Our eyes where lies Our goal!âthe Soul To free from thee, Oh! Earth, whose dearth We own, long knownâ (Though long full strong Its chain remain Fast wound around Our heartsâwhile smarts With pain in vain The breast oppressed,) If we can be But taught, our thought To raise in days Of fear, ev'n here, In flights, to heights Of Love aboveâ And found and ground Our fair Hope there, Even we may see Storms sink, and shrink That dread, thick spread Before, even o'er Our Souls (while rolls Away from day Each cloud whose shroud Had bound it roundâ The lastâfurled fast, The worstâdispersed!) And strong among Earth's woes that close Still thus round us Shall we then beâ If so we throw Our care but there On High, and try To grasp and clasp Those Rocks which shocks Of storms (whose Forms Of dread are spread Around) are found Too weak to shake. Oh! Heart!âyour part Is still to thrill With love, and prove The zeal you feel!â No plaint though faintâ No sigh will I Allow even now To shame mine aimâ To chide my pride, To daunt the vaunt That fills and thrills Inspires and fires My thought, o'erwrought, And Soulâthe whole!â I will fulfill My part, andâHeart! Teach thee to be (Despite each blight That may essay To chill, to killâ And joy destroy) A thing whose spring Ne'er dies, while Skies Of Love above Outshine divineâ Whose Light makes bright This Life of strife!â Those Dreamsâwhose streams Flow free, shall be No more traced o'er With clouds, whose shrouds Of old did fold Them round, uncrownedâ Of prideâdeep dyed With gloomâdark doom! No! plays Heaven's blaze In light, thrice-brightâ Now round them crowned With beams and gleams That gild Life's field, New given from Heaven! AUTUMN. How mournfully I view thy pomp depart, Oh! Nature, yet thou ever glorious art, 'Tis but a change of glory, and the light Of Summer, erst so lovely and so bright, Yields to the splendour of these Autumn hours, Which turn to living gold the Emerald bowers, This change indeed hath its own charms, and dull Are they who see not it is beautiful, But yet 'tis mournful thus to see decay, Though clad in Loveliness, assert its sway; Mournful are these dusk shades that swiftly close The shortened day, and brood in grey repose O'er all the scene, a little while before So rich with rainbow-colouring's dazzling store. Oh! the pathetic Beauty of the Year, When flowers forget their bloom and leaves grow sere, Autumn! Thou glorious Autumn! it might seem Thou wert a Prophetess in passionate dream, Foretelling to this fleeting World its fate, This World of brief though of uncertain date, And crying still âDecayâDeathâDeathâDecayââ To all that breathe and live from day to day. Sad Autumn, for the pomp wherewith thou'rt clad, But makes thee seem more exquisitely sad, The Earthly scene is given thee for awhile, And vainly dost thou smile thy Sunset smile As though to check the ruin then begun, Which thou mayst mask awhile but canst not shun. In sooth thou dost array the wond'rous scene With rainbow hues more rich than Summer's green, And lend'st the gorgeous colourings of the rose To things whose life must soon and sadly close, And sheath'st in burning gold the withered leaf, And shroud'st in pomp the passion of thy grief, Sad Autumn! thou art here, ev'n now thou'rt here, And 'tis a dazzling World although a drear! Oh! melancholy Seasonâthou art now Stamped with a World's decay upon thy brow, And drawest near unto thine own, ere long Shall Winter reign thy disrobed haunts among; And Oh! less dreary shall he seem to me With all his rough and bleak austerity, Than those proud funeral splendours that array Thy changeful scene and blazon forth Decay. The leafless bough I rather had behold Than that which glistens with thy lifeless gold, The snow-piled ground than this embroidered floor, As though with blazing jewels covered o'er, And yet whose radiant and illumined store Is very dust and ashes spread in vainâ When breathes one breeze they're swept away againâ Winter! thy barrenness less shocks my sight Than this sad mockery of a lost delight, Come with thy frowning and o'ershadowing gloom, And sweep the pompous gilding from the tomb! THE WORLD'S TRUE VALUE. Once how I loved this World below, I trusted it and prized it soâ I laughed when others sighing said, âIt is a gloomy World and dread.â I laughed and I believed them not, So glad and cloudless was my lot, I thought within my very heart, Sweet World! how bright how fair thou art. I laughed! and feared no future day, I nothing knew of Grief's dark sway, And Pain for me was but a word Which all incredulous I heard. How deep and dark and change soon came O'er Soul of Light and Thought of Flame, Then cried I loud, Grief's veriest slave, âOh! World!âthou'rt cruel as the Grave!â I deemed none could be happy here, I thought the smile but masked the tear, I cried within mine inmost Heart, âDark World!âhow sad a World thou art!â Those who ne'er look this Life beyond, Are mocked thus by illusions fondâ The truth to them may not appear In living beautyâfair and clear. Now, now, Oh! World! I know thy worth, I praise thee notânor blame thee, Earth, But oft unto myself I sayâ âOh! World! thou art but dust and clay.â This Earth is not the abiding place Of man's immortal mighty raceâ It is the school where he must learn Deep lessons ofttimes harsh and stern. Now, nowâthe hopes of higher things Uplift me on their viewless wings, I walk 'mid Earth's poor vanities, With heart estranged and loveless eyes. The treasures of my former trust I know are ashes all and dust, But Earth hath treasures, and I prize Those things that feeling sanctifies. Oh! Love! thy treasures here can bless With all but Angel happinessâ And did not one dark shadow fall O'er thee, thou wert enchantment all. Did that dread shadow o'er thy path Not brood in stern unpitying wrath, Thou wert Heav'n's own beatitude, But Death hath still thy steps pursued. Oh! World!âwhen others sighing say, With hopeless tone of grief to-day, âA heavy, gloomy World is this,ââ I answerââBut it leads to bliss!â Or if, like me in other days, Some all too fondly lightly praise, And cry, âIt is a World of joy,â I warn them 'twill their hopes destroy! Those, those but in the Present live, Who think that it is formed to give True lasting pleasure to their Souls, Soon breaks the wave that foam-lit rolls. 'Tis not a World of Joy or Grief, But in its hurried passage brief Both, both are ever mingled stillâ A World commixed of Good and Ill! The storm hath still its rainbow bright, A myriad myriad Stars the Night!â In the sweet South the Death wind blowsâ And still the thorn lives with the rose! Its precious and its fearful things, Its sweetest and its bitterest springs, Still joined together oft are found In strange and startling union boundâ And he who hopes the rose to pull Nor yet with this the thorn to cull, Must learn a lesson soon or late, That shall crush down his Heart elate! And he who seeks the rainbow's gleam In Skies that but with Sunshine stream, Shall know ere long 'tis storms that bring That beautiful and blessed thing! And he who watcheth in the Day For the rich Stars' etherial ray, Must wait until the closing Night Affordeth their enchanted light! And he who would expect to inhale Thou sweet, sweet South, thine odorous gale Without one drawback to Delight, Perchance may perish in its blight! Oh! World! from out thine Ill springs Goodâ Thy best may be with wrong imbuedâ 'Tis change and contradiction still! But, praised be Heaven, 'tis not all Ill! For who can sayâwith open Heartâ âGood is my due and my desert?ââ Oh! who can say he merits aught But Griefs that Man on Man hath brought? PROUD GRENADA'S CHIEFTAIN LORDS. Chieftains! Ye Sons of Fame and Glory! Sons of mighty Fame, Moorish Chieftains!âspeaks your story, When men speak your name, 'Tis a dark pathetic tale! There seems something of stern mystery In the mournful fate ye found, 'Twas the Poetry of History, Howâhow were ye uncrownedâ Forth scattered in confusion pale Fled the Lords of bright Grenada, Proud Grenada's Chieftain Lords! They forgotâwithout regrettingâ Their dark Sires' old place, Their Fathers' Fatherland forgettingâ A transplanted Raceâ But 'twas not to be forgot; From their happy seats and glorious They were forced to fly, Banished by a Foe victorious, With a bosom-bursting sigh They forsook the enchanted spot, Crowned by Towers of the Old Alhambra, By the Alhambra's royal Towers! Back, back to the Ancestorial Regions Ye were hurried then, Who seemed a race (ere quailed your Legions) Of Monarchic Men!â So you nobly played your parts While all things under you still flourishedâ Art and Science grewâ Emulation's strength was nourished, Moorish Chiefs, by you!â But how bowed the mighty hearts Of the Monarchs of Grenada, Of Grenada's Masters proud! Loudly rose the voice of wailing, Many a cry of griefâ Banners low in dust were trailing, Fallen like Autumn's leaf! All was horror and dismay; Faint the tecbir-shouts were swelling Ever and anon In vainâwhile Life-blood streams were welling, And all hope was goneâ While fled their vanquished Lords that day From the fair Towers of the Alhambra, From the Alhambra's glorious Towers! Oh! the gloomâthe desolationâ The anguish and the woeâ 'Twas the death-stroke of a Nationâ Fell and fiery blow! Allah!â'twas a fearful day.â Weep o'er the Empire's dark decliningâ (Weepâweep burning tearsâ) O'er whose throne the Sun rose shining Full Seven hundred years.â Then wrenched was the Oldâthe Imperial sway From the Sovereigns of Grenadaâ Proud Grenada's Sovereign Lords! Their great pompâtheir palaced splendourâ Earth's most dazzling boastâ They were destined to surrenderâ All was leftâand lost!â Came the conquering thousands on Through paths and places of their glory, Darkened and disgraced, Breathless, dust-defiled, and gory, Through the streets they paced, To where the Palace crescents shone O'er the emblazed Domes of the Alhambra, O'er the Alhambra's sumptuous Domes! What brave heart but then was breaking In that day of doomâ Fair Grenada's streets forsakingâ Shadowed o'er with gloom! Those were desperate, desperate hours! Afric then, once more possessing, Her proud children, mournedâ To her dusky bosom pressing Those who scourgedâreturnedâ Royal Chivalry's bruised Flowers Once Liege Lords of strong Grenada, Proud Grenada's Warrior Lords! Their state, their pride, their strength departedâ Crossed they then the Sea, Sighed in vain the valourous heartedâ Such was Heaven's decreeâ Such Heaven's dread and strong command, But while rolls in might victorious The great stream of Timeâ Stand their monumentsâall glorious Monuments sublimeâ On the Spaniard's soil they stand, The old Towers Imperial of the Alhambra, The Alhambra's many-clustering Towers! Since that, stern European Morning, Which crushed Afric's raceâ They have towered on high adorning Their proud ancient place Fairâand glorious still to seeâ And in dazzling pomp unfaded Still may they outshineâ Though the crowned heads they o'ershaded Low in dust reclineâ Though deserted must they beâ The Chiefless Castles of Grenada! Proud Grenada's Kingless Courts! The old crowned Liege Lords, whose dread Dominion Stretched forth, far and wideâ These soared upon the Eagle's pinion But to vail their pride! How froze Life's currents in their veins!â How while still on Earth remaining Must they have deplored Their palmy stateâtriumphant reigning 'Mongst those Bowers adoredâ Scattered o'er the Elysian Plains, O'erhung by Towers the Old Alhambraâ By the Alhambra's Heaven-kissed Towers! OLD NORWAY. Old Norway rises up to war, The Signal-summons free and far Arouses all her fair-haired Sons, The dauntless and the Mighty Ones! The embattled rocksâthe emblackened woodsâ The gusty hillsâand roaring floodsâ These too might well appear to share In stern Old Norway's marshalled war! But blackened woodsâand battled rocksâ And bellowing torrents' startling shocksâ Thundering defiance and commandâ These cannot guardânor save a Land. 'Tis Love's unconquerable heart That plays on Earth a Godlike partâ Mightier than thunderbolt and brandâ That makes invincibleâthe Land! TRUE STRENGTH. Yes! we walk, Earth, uncertain and afraid, Encompassed round about with gloom and shade, And still in sorrow and in shame we cry âOut upon this abhorred uncertainty!â But Oh! these wearying doubtings, this distrust, While yet we are but dwellers in the Dust, (While yet our Earthly journey we pursue) Human misgivings, human faulterings too, These prove our Strengths, our Sovereign Strengths, if these Teach us to strive with outstretched hand to seize On that Almightiest Rock of Aid above, Which Mercy hath vouchsafed to usâand Love! Yes! those who in the depth of self-distrust Contemn their own vain powers, with scorn most just, Shall find, 'mid all the griefs of mortal doom That very helplessness and doubt become The source of their most Kingly Strengthsâif still A sage and steadfast part they here fulfill! Oh! what a solace shall the weary find, Their minds reposing on the All-Knowing Mind! BRITOMART. Oh! Britomart loveliest!âOh! loved Britomart! Unto me yield thy virgin and innocent heart, For the smile of thy lip is to me more, far more, Than the treasures that heap El Dorado's rich shore! Oh! Britomart!âbeautiful, bright Britomart! 'Tis for thee that I bear Love's deep, Soul-piercing smart; The least knot that hath on thy gemmed stomachere lain, Is more precious to me than all guerdon and gain! Thou art far from me nowâthou'rt the pride of the Court, Where the great and the gay and the gallant resort, And a crowd of young lovers there sigh in thy train, For I know where thou artâLove for ever must reign! Let the Court-gallants flatterâthe Court-nobles swearâ Let the Court-minstrels praise theeâthou first of the fair! 'Tis afar from the Court that with fond faithful breast Mourns the poor contemned Lover who loves thee the best. Ever fairest art thou, in Hall, Palace, and Bower, In the garland of Beauty thou'rt still the chief flower; Thou'rt the Queen of the Lovely!âOh! deign but to prove For the sake of thine Arnulf, the Queen too of Love! No! I feel 'tis all hopelessâI know 'tis in vainâ Thou look'st scornfully down on my prayers and my pain, Then away to the warsâlet me give unto fame My bright, tyrannous Ladye's too dearly-loved name! Where'er shines the fair Sun, or the quartered Winds blow, I will make men the pomp of thy beauty to know, Where'er blow the free Winds, where'er Sunlight doth shine, All mankind will I make sighing Lovers of thine! I will build such a Pyramidâmighty and proudâ To thine honour, Oh! Ladye!âmy Sovran avowed! All of passionate hearts fired with dreams of thy charms, That e'en thou shalt say âPraised be his zeal and his arms!â All Europe, and Asia, and Afric shall share In the passion I boast ofâthe penance I bearâ The World shall throb high with one deep mighty heartâ And that shall but beat for the adored Britomart! Then perchance with a late, but a precious remorse, Thou mayst turn to thine Arnulfâto arms! thenâto horse! Oh! that thought is enough to uphold, and inspire, Still the hand is all strength, when the heart is all fire! All the wide World shall ring with my love and thy fame, Tens of thousands shall echo my sighs, and thy name And that World shall henceforth have but one burning heart, And Oh! that shall but burn for the adored Britomart! TELL ME, SWEET SPRING! Tell me, sweet Spring! thy tale, Thy joyous tale and bright, Sorrow and memory paleâ These should from thee take flight! Thy dear Interpreters, Cuckoo and soaring lark, How their rich language stirs Sense, heart, and spiritâhark! Hark! how they fill the air, Deeply with their delight, Oh! let us chase vain careâ Bid weary Grief take flight! Tell me thy tales of joy, Springâgolden glorious Spring, Hope shall my heart rebuoy, Fear shall ere long take wing! Thou tell'st of mighty thingsâ Bright and enchanted Time!â HastenâOh! Spring of Springs! Season of Heaven sublime! Every flower withered here, Then shall be found once more, All lost thingsâbright and dearâ Shall Heaven's Spring-time restore! And these glad vernal hours Tell us, while fast they flee, How fair 'mid deathless bowers ThouâSpring of Heaven!âmust be! THE HUSH OF NIGHT. The Hush of Night!âthe Majesty of Stars! How do these chide our secret bosomed wars, Oh! who can look from troubled Earth to Heaven Nor feel how much they have to be forgiven! While thoughts strike thoughtsâas spears strike spearsâto bring Wild jarsâvain flashesâbut no worthier thing, Say, dare we think these strifes that never cease, Can please the Almighty Author of all Peace?</field>
