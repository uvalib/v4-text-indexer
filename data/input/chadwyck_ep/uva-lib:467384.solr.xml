      <field name="fulltext">I. BE READY! War! is the word: no more delays By diplomatic notes; Rogues only mind what Must-be says From brass and iron throats; The last resort of crowds and kings Is all that now remains,— And we must fetter men and things With Must-be's honest chains! Soon as the breath of balmy May Dissolves the Russian snows,— Soon as above its granite quay The swollen Neva flows,— Look out! look out! as sure as suns Those Arctic fetters melt, A squadron with a thousand guns Shall gather at The Belt! O prudent Britain, stand prepared By fortress and by fleet; Stand on your guard, by watch and ward, Those Scythian guests to greet! O Firth of Forth, their welcome shout From every cannon's mouth! O Thames, let thunderclaps ring out Their coming to the South! Be ready!—On our virgin coast No buccanier shall land,— No quarter for the pirate host, —Except on Goodwin Sand! Or if by chance one floats ashore, And calls in jetsam-style, He'll scarcely get aboard once more —It won't be worth his while! Be ready!—if by darker chance Invaders really came With every horrid circumstance Of ruthless sword and flame, Then should we know—too late for Some!— How wise it is to stand Prepared,—if brigands dare to come— To hang them out of hand! Shame! that a despot, mad and blind By pampered pride too long, Can, in this age of march of mind, O'erwhelm the world with wrong! Like Attila, at his sole will Can flog it as a Rod, By hecatombs his people kill, And then be called their God! II. THE VAN AND THE REAR. Brilliant troops in proud array, Thrilling trumpets, rattling drums, Colours, plumes, and pennons gay, Helmets flashing back the day,— In this spirit-stirring way The gallant wargod comes! Mangled wretches, horrors dire, Groans and curses, wounds and woes, Slaughter, fever, famine, fire, Devils doing hell's desire,— By this road of blood and mire The cruel wargod goes! Spouting flame sublimely out Batteries thunder in the Van, Fling their glorious bolts about, Gaily scare some rabble rout, And wake up Moloch with a shout In every heart of man! But those murderous guns do more Than Fury's furnace heat; Gunner's match and cannon's roar Rearward, red libations pour Of limbs and lives and human gore Around the wargod's feet! And are you caught by glittering bait, O woman-hearted Man? Shall one mean prize of tinsel state Outflare those bloody blanks of fate And daub with gilt the fiends that wait The passing of the Van? Turn then, poor glory-stricken fool, Come hither to the Rear, Where under agony's stern school Fevers grow hot, while passions cool, And lying in a bloody pool Dead Glory festers here! O nothing but the strongest need Demands a marching Van,— For whether Right or Wrong succeed The Rearward, where so many bleed, Proclaims in groans that War's best deed Is conquering Peace for Man! Therefore, in that red Rearward's spite, Reluctantly, at length, England has roused her lion might And sent her Vanguard out to fight Bound by such Need, for Peace and Right, A threefold cord of strength. III. THE LION AND THE BEAR. England, home of holy Light, Where the peaceful virtues dwell,— England, lover of the Right For thy weal almost too well,— Friend of all by wrong oppress'd, Foe to all who dare that wrong, Now at length thy patient rest Break,—for vengeance swift and strong! What a pity, what a shame, That one madman's lust of power So can set the world aflame And its crop of peace devour; That this bad ambitious Czar Thus can human progress check, And let loose the storms of war So much happiness to wreck! O that Judgment from High Heaven Fell upon that caitiff first! O that all this thundery leven On his single head might burst, Ere so many myriads groan For the woes his lust hath bred, Would that God on Mercy's throne Struck the world's disturber dead! But,—if Providence allows, In His wisdom dark and deep, This one reveller to carouse On the tears that myriads weep,— Up, Great England! let him feel That thy might can match his own; Set thy giant armèd heel On this rude barbarian's throne! Tread his honour in the dust; To the winds his pride be tost,— And for his ambitious lust Make his coffers pay the cost: Waste no courtesies ill-timed On this Scythian burglar-chief, But his hands, by crime begrimed, Pinion like a common thief! Forced, as champion of the right, Forced, as pledged against the wrong, Forced, reluctantly, to fight After peaceful suffering long,— Now, since Duty calls, at length Rouse thee from thy slumbrous lair, And with all thy Lion strength Rend this rough marauding Bear! IV. THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG. “Thou shalt not covet”:—righteous Czar So orthodox and sound, So swift to wage a Holy War Lest heresies abound,— Has ever that old sentence left (In some more pious time) Your soul imprest that thoughts of theft Are nothing short of crime? “Thou shalt not steal”:—illustrious Man, The thief you brand and knout Sins on a very petty plan To this you set about; What's in a hen, a horse, a sheep, Whose loss some goodwife grieves, To guilt that makes ten millions weep Because a Monarch thieves? “Thou shalt not murder”:—mighty Sire, The cutthroat whom you hang Has learnt his trade of some one higher, And says he's of Your gang! What's in one weasand slit—a boor's— To slaughter, famine, fire, Ravaging villages by scores, To glut a Czar's desire? O who can truly think or tell The sorrows and the sins This lust of conquest fierce and fell Achieves when it begins? What depth can gauge a despot's guilt Whose dread ukase is still To myriads—that their blood be spilt To work one evil will! But shall we tamely stand aside To let a bandit's power, Wholesale in guilt, and craft, and pride, His neighbour's home devour? Or blast half Europe's common weal, And make the rest a wreck, By suffering him to set his heel Upon the world's broad neck? No!—England, to whose crown belongs The custody of Right, Resolves to crush such utter wrongs With all her main and might; To vindicate eternal laws At Duty's high behest, And fighting in a righteous cause For Right to do her best! V. OUR FALSE-AND-TRUE POSITION. Odd things happen nowadays; Earth's kaleidoscope of change Brings about in wondrous ways Combinations passing strange: Fixt by more than mortal power Every pattern is perplext, And we watch from hour to hour What on earth's to happen next! Here we are, by no mischance, (Duty's call we dare not shirk,) Hand in hand with papal France Fighting for the pagan Turk All against a christian Czar And his holy church of Greece Forced unwillingly to war Simply as the friends of peace! Who could, but a year ago, Such involvements have foreseen? Who might guess that friend and foe Could so queerly mixt have been? Then, the Frenchman was our fear, And our utter scorn the Pope, While, against all perils near, Russia stood for Europe's hope! Russia, pah! the caitiff's name (Though his people are more worth) In our nostrils stinks for shame, For his empire blights this earth: By his lustful crafty crimes Nicholas has grown outright, In the judgment of the times, Europe's hatred and despite. Everywhere he steals and blasts,— Poland, Finland, Georgia, Greece; Wheresoe'er his net he casts There he sets his curse on peace: Hatred frowns where Russia rules, For her evil lord commands Peoples to be tyrant's tools Briareus's hundred hands! Therefore shall dear England's power Stoutly such false rule deny, And when despots would devour Shall their tyranny defy: Therefore will we, Queen and Realm, With fraternal France stand strong, Lest this madman overwhelm Right unjustly suffering Wrong. VI. THE TWO NEIGHBOURS. A quarrelsome churl and a peaceable man Were living side by side, And the peaceable man as the wisest plan Put up with his neighbour's pride, Put up with his humours, and never said nay To much that my lord condescended to say. But soon Sir Quarrelsome got up a sham, —Much like the wolf in the fable— Resolved to devour this peaceable lamb As he fancied he was able; So to brew up a worry he makes a great fuss About his religion, this quarrelsome Russ. The peaceable man,—tho' they call him a Turk, Gave all that his neighbour desired, Whatever was reason he made no work Of yielding, as required; But nothing would do, for the quarrelsome boor Wanted a quarrel—and something more! He wanted more than the Turk could yield, And more than a man should give; He wanted to steal his neighbour's field, In his neighbour's house to live: In fact, he coveted warmer climes And took little court of covetous crimes. So Menskickoff with vigour and spite Did all that his master bid him; He kick'd to the left, and he kick'd to the right, And nobody check'd or chid him; A worthy ambassador, rude and rough, Was this redoubtable Menskickoff! The Turk he happened to have two friends, Good sensible fellows and strong, To one and the other in trouble he sends To tell them of this wrong, And they together resolve as they can To put into limbo the quarrelsome man. For the quarrelsome churl had managed to be A nuisance to all around him; In short, all Europe seem'd to agree That blest were the bonds that bound him; For he gloom'd on the earth like a northerly cloud, And every one wish'd that his shirt was a shroud! Accordingly, those two friends and the Turk Have come to a fix'd conclusion Of that world-worry to make short work And cover him up with confusion: By sea and by land this boor to withstand, And muzzle the Bear with a resolute hand. VII. TO THE SOLDIERS. Soldiers! best of friends to Peace When you make a Tyrant yield,— Honour's Watch! the world's Police! Law's defence, and Order's shield! Soldiers! glory and success Shall with laurel shade each brow, For, while God and Duty bless You shall march to conquest now! Prompt and glad to aid the right, Zealous to avenge the wrong, Britain's lion in his might Now uprises stern and strong,— To deliver them that cry, And to rescue the opprest, Righteousness to set on high, And to crush a despot's crest! Strange it seems, but it is just That the Cross and Crescent stand Thus, to quell a tyrant's lust, Side by side and hand in hand; Just, and right, for wrongful Might Roars in the way a rude wild beast, And if Man forbears the fight All are victims, West and East! Stolen from their distant homes, Knouted to the ranks like cattle Lo! the host of serfdom comes Sadly sluggishly to battle! Wretched people, would we might Save the lives of such poor slaves,— But to spare them in the fight Freemen then must fill their graves! No! with vigour to the fray Forwards march, and pity not,— Pick the officers away With your rifles at long shot,— Scatter then with grape and shell Each dull boor and stubborn serf, Till Wallachia's harvests swell With half Russia in its turf! No half-measures! gun to gun, Man to man, and horse to horse, Quickly do what must be done, Battle down this Bear by force! No more tenderness! the time For such tameness now is past,— Sternly let us kill the crime, To make sure it is the last! VIII. TO THE SAILORS. Noble children of the Sea, Hearty, honest, kind and true,— England, mother of the free, Looks in hope to men like you: Well may she now confide the Right, British Sailors, to your power, Well assured in storm and fight You stand true in trial's hour! Look you! Russia thinks to steal Wider countries, warmer climes, Daring with rapacious zeal Coldest crafts and boldest crimes: So, he covets evermore Good men's hearths and free men's homes, Till, outstretch'd from shore to shore, Hitherward the despot comes! Stop him! stop him while you may; Let the horrid woes of war Be exhausted far away Round about this ravening Czar; Grapple with him near his lair, Catch him in this Turkish noose, Muzzle, throttle this rough bear, Let not the marauder loose! For Sinope's coward slaughter Deal him wages in hot shot, Blow the bully out of water, Let him taste the pirate's lot; In due vengeance deep and dire On his head your thunders roll, Battering down with deadly fire Cronstadt and Sebastopol! Think not it's for Turkey's cause Or for Mahomet we fight;— No! for all men's rights and laws Schemed against by brutal might: This great burglar must be taught That his course of crime must cease, And the common foe be caught That the world may live in peace. Ah! you know not, what a blain, If he won, the world would smite; Genghis Khan and Tamerlane In this hungry Hunn unite! O! you guess not, when you win, What a conquest yours will be, Good triumphant over Sin, Russia crush'd, and Europe free! IX. NEUTRALITY: And Postscript, overleaf. As well as one can, and as long as one can, Keep out of a quarrel, no doubt,— This must be the plan for a sensible man Whose wisdom it is to keep out! But—let him be sure it is wise from the first, And see whether fast-fighting friends Wouldn't make for his quarrel, wherever it burst, Some solid sufficient amends. Yes, Austria! Prussia! and Sweden, and all! Look sharp if your trimming be wise; You'll feel pretty small, if Russia should fall, And smaller, if Russia should rise; If Europe's police have the Czar on the hip, And you haven't helped,—it is ill,— But if he should happen to give them the slip, Your state is more desperate still! There's Lombardy watching, and Poland awake, And Hungary, gnawing her heart, Like a leash of good greyhounds, right eager to take The chance of the day for a start; And Russia herself, if she once have the power Will render you bitterest thanks For succour withheld in necessity's hour When all her dear neighbours were—blanks! O had you been wiser, and join'd with the good In aiding the Right as you ought, In the stern coming struggle you all should have stood, But—trimmers must ever be nought; Had you fought as you ought in defence of the Right, It surely had sped, and been strong, But just as your cowardice fails in the fight You add a new strength to the Wrong! Be sure the best policy is (as we know) To be honest, and fearless, and true; To deal the wrongdoer one vigorous blow, And give the rightdealer his due; We grant, it is awkward to quarrel with friends, But if they grow wicked, we must; We grant it, that Mahomet's name recommends No further the claim that is Just! But, since this red Russia is given to steal, All honest men now must unite And turn special constables for the world's weal To guard and deliver the Right! If shame has withheld you from helping the Russ, Shame ought not your help to withhold From us who are honestly hindering thus A wolf from attacking the fold. POSTSCRIPT. It is well: you have wisely considered the chance, And seen that it pays to belong To the phalanx of right, with England and France Array'd against Russia and wrong! It is well: we commend your discretion, though slow; But had you stood sooner with us, The world's thunder-Word, without need of a Blow, Would have settled this recreant Russ. But, mark you!—we must not be hampered by friends, Nor hinder'd in victory's hour From stèrnly exacting the strictest amends, And crushing despotical power: Our Ægis shall be to you Ajax's shield, And Teucer may shoot from behind, But what we will loose in the fairly-fought field Diplomacy never shall bind! Vienna can scatter her friends with the pen Much more than her foes with the sword; Berlin may do damage to decenter men Than Vladimir's barbarous horde: Allies, with a conscience made wicked and weak By “Poland,” that ghost never laid, Of trusting too strongly “each giftbearing Greek” May sensibly make us “afraid.” Our motto is simply—“May God guard the right!” Our trust, that the “Truth shall prevail;” Our text, that “Accursed in everyone's sight The land-mark-remover shall fail:” Our only real fear, lest cousins and kings Should hinder the swing of the whip,— For each has been guilty of similar things Unwept by the heart or the lip! Let Hungary, Italy, Poland, be righted; And Austria turn from her crimes: Let Prussia's good king to his people united Grant all that he promised betimes: Let the Pope from his crafts and his cruelties cease, And Tuscany's Duke be ashamed, And Bomba of Naples his martyrs release, As Gladstone indignantly claim'd! Let both Principalities, under one crown, Our bulwark be fix'd as a rock; Let Russia, degraded, cut up, and cut down, Be made the world's byeword and mock: Let happiness, Liberty, brotherhood, reason Advance with all peoples around,— And glad shall we be if an Emperor's treason Occasions so blest a rebound! X. FRENCH ALLIANCE. Rochefoucault and others tell us, In our friendships to take heed Lest our friends hereafter sell us, Turning to be—foes in need; And old Talleyrand advises Every man his friends to greet Much as foes in fair disguises, And his foes as friends to treat! Well; we won't despise the sages, But will hear them out, good sooth; Proverbs are the pith of ages, Pretty near the heart of truth: But, without unduly scorning Those old pundits of this earth, We need not expound their warning Into worse than it is worth. No,—we've not the least suspicion But of unison with us,— Everybody's present mission Is to stop this recreant Russ; Everybody means to do it, And to make him pay the shot; Deeply must the despot rue it, Might were Right if he did not. But when this is once effected, There remains one query still, Must the Popular-Elected Not reflect his people's will? May our strange ally, Sieur Crapaud, Not be glad to snatch this chance Of waving Oriflamme for drapeau Over us, as well as France? Freely would we give him credit For good sense and conduct too,— But he meant it, when he said it, He must wipe out Waterloo! 'Tis his destiny, he knows it; And, if “Fleur de lis” revives,— That's the sop, he simply throws it To his Cerberus,—and thrives! Cherbourg rings with sturdy labour, Troops are drilling night and day; Just as well for some near neighbour As for others far away! Yes,—if “Danai bring a present,” It were well to look ahead, Lest what now may seem so pleasant Turn at last to loss instead! It is well: we stand together, Fighting nobly for the right; But, consider calmly whether, Had there been no Eastern fight, We should not have felt more jealous Of such armaments in France? O remember,—Frenchmen tell us Friends may turn to foes perchance! XI. THE BITER BIT. He thought the time was come at last, The full four hundredth year,— That destiny the die had cast, And there was nought to fear; That St. Sophia's new-named dome Should gladden Catherine's soul, And the blest day at length was come When he might see Stamboul! He thought that Peter's embryo dream Was ready to be born,— That he was doom'd to clench the scheme, And clutch the Golden Horn; That England cared not for the Turk, And gloried in the Czar,— And France had rather too much work At home to wish for war. He thought that Louis Nap himself Was Britain's fear and scorn,— That Austria pined for want of pelf In bankruptcy forlorn,— That Blanc, Mazzini, and Kossuth Kept every king in dread,— And so he plann'd to cross the Pruth And fiercely go ahead! He thought,—I'll pick a quarrel now With that weak Turk at home, My Menskickoff shall make a row About the Church of Rome, Or Monks, or Greeks, or anything Or nothing,—that's the plan,— An orthodox and Christian king Shall quarrel, as he can! So down stole Bruin from his frost In hairy strength of limb; But lightly did he count the cost Of such a march to him: The way was long; the Turk too strong; And all the world agreed That injured Right from rampant Wrong Should sturdily be freed! He found that England stood with France Against him in array,— And Bruin cursed his sad mischance, But could not get away; Baffled, and to destruction hurl'd, And caught in his own pit,— The wondering and applauding world Beholds the Biter Bit! XII.—A SUSPICION. I.—AND A HOPE. II. [I.] Chivalrous England! too ready to fight For any one's wrong, or any one's right, Dear Quixote of Nations, complacently vow'd To rescue the weak and to baffle the proud,— While generous (as usual) on every side, Be just to yourself, whatever betide! For subtlety still may be shrewdly at work To stir up this strife with the Russ and the Turk, That you, the magnanimous lion, may roam In silly knight-errantry far from your home, And leave it unguarded, for jackals to tear The Lioness left with her cubs in your lair. O look to yourself: if your fleets are away And thanklessly fighting in nobody's pay; If Chobham's rehearsal was all for the Czar, And Portsmouth regatta meant Muscovite war; If stolidly now you maintain and defend So false a position as Mahomet's friend, And leave not alone such a couple of foes To hew done each other by fortunate blows; If still, like an Ajax, in stupid resolve You choose your brute strength in such strife to involve As muzzling two savages, tiger and bear, And not leaving either the other to tear: You will richly deserve as you dearly shall rue The doom which a brigand may destine for you, An Algerine razzia over the land, Secretly, suddenly, ruthlessly plann'd, A burglary schemed when the Master's away, A desperate vengeance for Waterloo Day! II. And yet,—if there be any cunning forsooth, Any honour or honesty, prudence or truth, If even self-interest reckon for aught, Or sense, in the school of adversity taught, Your “brigand,” whom paradox seems to delight, May still disappoint us,—by doing quite right! We surely may trust, as between man and man, An Emperor's word to be kept if he can, If he can, without loss to his handsomest gain, If he can, without hazarding peril or pain: And what should he win by this desperate chance Of feeding with slaughter the vengeance of France,— His glory disgraced by such bandit-like ways, And popular generals reaping the praise? What might he not lose, by evoking to life The spirit of faction, rebellion, and strife, The spirit of anarchy,—by his strong hand Quell'd into quiet all over his land? No! give him his due: for, truly to tell, Many things wisely, many things well, Much that is noble and just hath he done, And fairly may end what was foully begun: If steady persistence in good be pursued, Repentance of evil may grow from that good,— Both nations and men may have grace to return, Manasseh be pious, and Nineveh mourn! Then, hope for the better, while well is in sight, And let not suspicion sincerity blight, But honest good fellowship rivet the bands That bind in one brotherhood alien hands. XIII.—AMBIDEXTERA. [I.] And what if they fight? can it matter to us That Russ worry Turk, and Turk worry Russ? That two fierce fanatics manage at length To weaken each other's barbarian strength, And Sultan and Czar, from their pinnacles hurl'd, Both bleed in the dust for the gain of the world? Can it matter to us? what need that we fight For Muscovite insult, or Mussulman right, For Mahomet's Turkey, presuming on Fate, Or Petersburg tyranny, founded in hate? No!—England, the peaceful, does all that she can For the welfare and progress of civilised Man, But cannot consent in a quarrel to mix The limits of savage with savage to fix, Or strive to prop up, for one dearly-bought hour. So false and so foolish a “balance of power:” Then, rush to the battle! make short bloody work! Fall foul of each other, O Russ and O Turk! By mutual slaughter and fury to purge Fair Europe of boils at her uttermost verge! Press forward, ye frenzied and barbarous hordes With matchlocks and arrows and lances and swords, That thus the bad blood of the world be let out By hands that are skill'd in the bowstring and knout! Go,—turban'd and scymetar'd Pagan, attack The blood-drunken Tartar and brutal Cossack! Go,—red-revolutionist infidel herd, The kite and the raven and every foul bird, Go, mix with the mêlée! and drain to the South This ulcer of Earth in the Danube's red mouth! II. Can it matter to us? O, the matter is much If England be purg'd from the poison of such; If Christendom's humours be drawn from her head To the foot-distant seton of Turkey instead; If soldiers of fortune, and scoundrels of chance Converge to the Balkan from Prussia and France; If Europe be cleansed of her dregs and her scum By the blare of the bugle and tap of the drum; If the flare of the Crescent grow more and more dim, And the Bear be made weak in each murderous limb; If tyranny, darkness, and fatalist zeal Be shot down by bullet and cut down by steel, And all that is hostile to all that is good Be broken together, and smothered in blood! Can it matter to us? can it matter to Man? O, press to the battle, dear Liberty's van! Arouse thee, fair Hungary, crush'd and cast down, And find a new use for thy newly-found crown! Can it matter? The Rubicon now is the Pruth, Go forth, Alexander in Louis Kossuth! Can it matter? O Poland, thy glory revives, Kosciusko still lives in ten million of lives! Can it matter? Young Italy, patient but bold, Rekindle dead Rome and her greatness of old; Awake her to life by this storm in the East, And send to their limbo the Pope and the priest! Can it matter? O Greece, thou world-honour'd Greece, Arise in old majesty, beauty, and peace, And out of this turmoil win back for mankind A Pericles Age in the Reign of the Mind! III. What more can it matter? O more than them all, Than Liberty's triumph, or Tyranny's fall, Than despots unsceptred, or popery crush'd, Or red revolution with victory flush'd! It matters to us, that the downtrodden Right Be raised and revenged and establish'd in Might; It matters to us, that the Wrong and the Base Be check'd and confounded and drown'd in disgrace; That Russia be stopp'd in its criminal course And brigand rapacity fettered by force,— That all the fierce wrath of that roaming wild beast Be cribb'd and confined to the bounds of the East, Its mammoth-like muscles be pinion'd betimes, And stern retribution be dealt for its crimes! That Turkey, the innocent, injured, abused, Be help'd in right earnest and nothing refused, By sea and by land be delivered from wrong, And the weak be made able to grapple the strong, Its honest good-fellowship rescued in need, And the Lamb from the Wolf be courageously freed! It matters,—O much does it matter to Man, For who sees the End of what Russia began? This earthquake of nations, this hurricane dire, This heaving volcano, this deluge of fire, Must grow to a vortex and ever increase,— Till HE that is coming bring Glory and Peace, And shut up this Saturday Night of the Earth With its six thousandth year, its Sabbath-day's birth, When Right shall stand highest, and Wrong be down-hurl'd, And Justice and Mercy shall govern the world!</field>
