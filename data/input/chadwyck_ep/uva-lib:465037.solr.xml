      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I. Some of the following poems are of doubtfull attribution. CONVERSATION THE FIRST. TO A GREEN-CHAFER, ON A WHITE ROSE. You dwell within a lovely bower, Little chafer, gold and green, Nestling in the fairest flower, The rose of snow, the garden's queen. There you drink the chrystal dew, And your shards as emeralds bright And corselet, of the ruby's hue, Hide among the petals white. Your fringed feet may rest them there, And there your filmy wings may close, But do not wound the flower so fair That shelters you in sweet repose. Insect! be not like him who dares On pity's bosom to intrude, And then that gentle bosom tears With baseness and ingratitude. TO THE LADY-BIRD. Oh! Lady-bird, Lady-bird, why dost thou roam So far from thy comrades, so distant from home? Why dost thou, who can revel all day in the air, Who the sweets of the grove and the garden can share, In the fold of a leaf, who can form thee a bower, And a palace enjoy in the tube of a flower; Ah, why, simple Lady-bird, why dost thou venture, The dwellings of man so familiar to enter? Too soon you may find, that your trust is misplac'd, When by some cruel child you are wantonly chas'd, And your bright scarlet coat, so bespotted with black, May be torn by his barbarous hands from your back. And your smooth jetty corselet be pierced with a pin, That the urchin may see you in agonies spin; For his bosom is shut against pity's appeals, He has never been taught that a Lady-bird feels. Ah, then you'll regret you were tempted to rove, From the tall climbing hop, or the hazle's thick grove, And will fondly remember each arbour and tree, Where lately you wander'd contented and free; Then fly, simple Lady-bird!—fly away home, No more from your nest, and your children to roam. [Queen of fragrance, lovely Rose] EMILY. Queen of fragrance, lovely Rose, Thy soft and silken leaves disclose: The winter's past, the tempests fly, Soft gales breathe gently through the sky; The silver dews and genial showers Call forth a blooming waste of flowers; And lo! thy beauties now unclose, Queen of fragrance, lovely Rose! Yet, ah! how soon that bloom is flown, How soon thy blushing charms are gone! To-day thy crimson buds unveil, To-morrow scatter'd in the gale. Ah! human bliss as swiftly goes, And fades like thee, thou lovely Rose. THE SNAIL. To grass, or leaf, or fruit, or wall, The snail sticks fast, nor fears to fall, As if he grew there, house or all together. Within that house secure he hides, When danger imminent betides Of storm, or other harm besides, of weather. Give but his horns the slightest touch, His self-collecting power is such, He shrinks into his house with much displeasure. Where'er he dwells, he dwells alone, Except himself has chattels none, Well satisfied to be his own whole treasure. Thus Hermit like his life he leads Alone, on simple viands feeds, Nor at his humble banquet needs attendant. And tho' without society, He finds 'tis pleasant to be free, And that he's blest who need not be dependant. A WALK BY THE WATER. EMILY. Let us walk where reeds are growing, By the alders in the mead; Where the crystal streams are flowing, In whose waves the fishes feed. There the golden carp is laving, With the trout, the perch, and bream; Mark! their flexile fins are waving, As they glance along the stream. Now they sink in deeper billows, Now upon the surface rise; Or from under roots of willows, Dart to catch the water flies. 'Midst the reeds and pebbles hiding, See the minnow and the roach; Or by water-lilies gliding, Shun with fear our near approach. Do not dread us timid fishes, We have neither net nor hook; Wanderers we, whose only wishes Are to read in nature's book. INVITATION TO THE BEE. Child of patient industry, Little active busy bee, Thou art out at early morn, Just as the opening flowers are born, Among the green and grassy meads Where the cowslips hang their heads; Or by hedge-rows, while the dew Glitters on the harebell blue.— Then on eager wing art flown, To thymy hillocks on the down; Or to revel on the broom; Or suck the clover's crimson bloom; Murmuring still thou busy bee Thy little ode to industry! Go while summer suns are bright, Take at large thy wandering flight; Go and load thy tiny feet With every rich and various sweet, Cling around the flowring thorn, Dive in the woodbine's honied horn, Seek the wild rose that shades the dell, Explore the foxglove's freckled bell, Or in the heath flower's fairy cup Drink the fragrant spirit up. But when the meadows shall be mown, And summer's garlands overblown; Then come thou little busy bee, And let thy homestead be with me, There, shelter'd by thy straw-built hive, In my garden thou shalt live, And that garden shall supply Thy delicious alchemy; There for thee, in autumn, blows The Indian pink and latest rose, The mignonette perfumes the air, And stocks, unfading flowers, are there. Yet fear not when the tempests come, And drive thee to thy waxen home, That I shall then most treacherously For thy honey murder thee. Ah, no!—throughout the winter drear I'll feed thee, that another year Thou may'st renew thy industry Among the flowers, thou little busy bee. CONVERSATION THE SECOND. THE HEDGE-HOG SEEN IN A FREQUENTED PATH. Wherefore should man or thoughtless boy Thy quiet harmless life destroy, Innoxious urchin?—for thy food Is but the beetle and the fly, And all thy harmless luxury The swarming insects of the wood. Should man to whom his God has given Reason, the brightest ray of heaven, Delight to hurt, in senseless mirth, Inferior animals?—and dare To use his power in waging war Against his brethren of the earth? Poor creature! to the woods resort, Lest lingering here, inhuman sport Should render vain thy thorny case; And whelming water, deep and cold, Make thee thy spiny ball unfold, And shew thy simple negro face! Fly from the cruel; know than they Less fierce are ravenous beasts of prey, And should perchance these last come near thee; And fox or martin cat assail, Thou, safe within thy coat of mail, May cry—Ah! noli me tangere. THE EARLY BUTTERFLY. Trusting the first warm day of spring, When transient sunshine warms the sky, Light on his yellow spotted wing Comes forth the early butterfly. With wavering flight, he settles now Where pilewort spreads its blossoms fair, Or on the grass where daisies blow, Pausing, he rests his pinions there. But insect! in a luckless hour Thou from thy winter home hast come, For yet is seen no luscious flower With odour rich, and honied bloom. And these that to the early day Yet timidly their bells unfold, Close with the sun's retreating ray, And shut their humid eyes of gold. For night's dark shades then gather round, And night-winds whistle cold and keen, And hoary frost will crisp the ground And blight the leaves of budding green! And thou poor fly! so soft and frail, May'st perish e'er returning morn, Nor ever, on the summer gale, To taste of summer sweets be borne! Thus unexperienc'd rashness will presume On the fair promise of life's opening day, Nor dreams how soon the adverse storms may come, “That hush'd in grim repose, expect their evening prey.” THE MOTH. When dews fall fast, and rosy day Fades slowly in the west away, While evening breezes bend the future sheaves; Votary of vesper's humid light, The moth, pale wanderer of the night, From his green cradle comes, amid the whispering leaves. The birds on insect life that feast, Now in their woody coverts rest, The swallow slumbers in his dome of clay, And of the numerous tribes who war On the small denizens of air, The shrieking bat alone is on the wing for prey. Eluding him, on lacey plume The silver moth enjoys the gloom, Glancing on tremulous wing thro' twilight bowers, Now flits where warm nasturtiums glow, Now quivers on the jasmine bough, And sucks with spiral tongue the balm of sleeping flowers. Yet if from open casement stream The taper's bright aspiring beam, And strikes with comet ray his dazzled sight; Nor perfum'd leaf, nor honied flower, To check his wild career have power, But to the attracting flame he takes his rapid flight. Round it he darts in dizzy rings, And soon his soft and powder'd wings Are singed; and dimmer grow his pearly eyes, And now his struggling feet are foil'd, And scorch'd, entangled, burnt, and soil'd, His fragile form is lost—the wretched insect dies! Emblem too just of one, whose way Thro the calm vale of life might lay, Yet lured by vanity's illusive fires Far from that tranquil vale aside, Like this poor insect suicide Follows the fatal light, and in its flame expires. THE GLOW-WORM. If on some balmy breathing night of Spring The happy child, to whom the world is new, Pursues the evening moth of mealy wing, Or from the heath flower beats the sparkling dew, He sees, before his inexperienc'd eyes, The brilliant glow-worm like a meteor shine On the turf bank; amaz'd and pleas'd he cries, “Star of the dewy grass, I make thee mine!” Then, e'er he sleeps, collects the moisten'd flower, And bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold, And dreams that fairy lamps illume his bower, Yet with the morning shudders to behold His lucid treasure, rayless as the dust. So turns the world's bright joys to cold and blank disgust. THE MIMOSA. Softly blow the western breezes, Sweetly shines the evening sun; But you, mimosa! nothing pleases, You, what delights your comrades teizes, What they enjoy you try to shun. Alike annoy'd by heat or cold, Ever too little or too much, As if by heaviest winds controul'd, Your leaves before a zephyr fold, And tremble at the slightest touch. Flutt'ring around, in playful rings, A gilded fly your beauty greeted; But, from his light and filmy wings, As if he had lanced a thousand stings, Your shuddering folioles retreated! Those feathery leaves are like the plume, Pluck'd from the bird of Indian skies; But should you therefore thus presume, While others boast a fairer bloom, All that surrounds you to despise? The rose, whose blushing blossoms blow, Pride of the vegetal creation, The air and light disdains not so, And the fastidious pride you show, Is not reserve, but affectation. THE DORMOUSE JUST TAKEN. Sleep on, sleep on, poor captive mouse, Oh sleep! unconscious of the fate That ruthless spoil'd thy cosey Cosey, a Scottish expression for snug. house, And tore thee from thy mate. What barbarous hand could thus molest A little innocent like thee, And drag thee from thy mossy nest To sad captivity? Ah! when suspended life again Thy torpid senses shall recall, Poor guiltless prisoner! what pain Thy bosom shall appal. When starting up in wild affright, Thy bright round eyes shall vainly seek Thy tiny spouse, with breast so white, Thy whisker'd brethren sleek; Thy snug warm nest with feathers lined, Thy winter store of roots and corn; Nor nuts nor beech-mast shalt thou find, The toil of many a morn. Thy soft white feet around thy cage Will cling; while thou in hopeless pain Wilt waste thy little life in rage, To find thy struggles vain! Yet since thou'rt fall'n in gentle hands, Oh! captive mouse, allay thy grief, For light shall be thy silken bands, And time afford relief. Warm is the lodging, soft the bed, Thy little mistress will prepare; By her kind hands thou shalt be fed, And dainties be thy fare. But neither men nor mice forget Their native home, where'er they be, And fondly thou wilt still regret Thy wild woods, loves, and liberty! CONVERSATION THE THIRD. [FIRST PART] VIOLETS. EMILY. Sweet Violets! from your humble beds Among the moss, beneath the thorn, You rear your unprotected heads, And brave the cold and chearless morn Of early March; not yet are past The wintry cloud, the sullen blast, Which, when your fragrant buds shall blow, May lay those purple beauties low. Ah stay awhile, till warmer showers And brighter suns shall chear the day; Sweet Violets stay, till hardier flowers Prepare to meet the lovely May. Then from your mossy shelter come, And rival every richer bloom; For though their colours gayer shine, Their odours do not equal thine. And thus real merit still may dare to vie, With all that wealth bestows, or pageant heraldry. TO THE SNOW-DROP. EMILY. Like pendant flakes of vegetating snow, The early herald of the infant year, E'er yet the adventurous Crocus dares to blow Beneath the orchard boughs, thy buds appear. While still the cold north-east ungenial lowers, And scarce the hazle in the leafless copse Or sallows shew their downy powder'd flowers, The grass is spangled with thy silver drops. Yet, when those pallid blossoms shall give place To countless tribes of richer hue and scent, Summer's gay blooms, and Autumn's yellow race, I shall thy pale inodorous bells lament. So journeying onward in life's varying track, Even while warm youth its bright illusion lends, Fond Memory often with regret looks back To childhood's pleasures, and to infant friends. THE HUMBLE BEE. Good morrow, gentle humble bee, You are abroad betimes, I see, And sportive fly from tree to tree, To take the air; And visit each gay flower that blows; While every bell and bud that glows, Quite from the daisy to the rose, Your visits share. Saluting now the pied carnation, Now on the aster taking station, Murmuring your ardent admiration; Then off you frisk, Where poppies hang their heavy heads, Or where the gorgeous sun-flower spreads For you her luscious golden beds, On her broad disk. To live on pleasure's painted wing, To feed on all the sweets of Spring, Must be a mighty pleasant thing, If it would last. But you, no doubt, have wisely thought, These joys may be too dearly bought, And will not unprepar'd be caught When Summer's past. For soon will fly the laughing hours, And this delightful waste of flowers Will shrink before the wintry showers And winds so keen. Alas! who then will lend you aid, If your dry cell be yet unmade, Nor store of wax and honey laid In magazine? Then, Lady Buzz, you will repent, That hours for useful labour meant Were so unprofitably spent, And idly lost. By cold and hunger keen oppress'd, Say, will your yellow velvet vest, Or the fur tippet on your breast, Shield you from frost? Ah! haste your winter stock to save, That snug within your Christmas cave, When snows fall fast and tempests rave, You may remain. And the hard season braving there, On Spring's warm gales you will repair, Elate thro' chrystal fields of air, To bliss again! SECOND PART. THE GRASSHOPPER. Happy insect, what can be In happiness compar'd to thee, Fed with nourishment divine, The dewy morning's chrystal wine; For Nature waits upon thee still, And thy verdant cup doth fill. All the fields which thou dost see, All the plants belong to thee; All that Summer suns produce Are, blest insect! for thy use: While thy feast doth not destroy The verdure thou dost thus enjoy, But the blythe shepherd haileth thee, Singing as musical as he; And peasants love thy voice to hear, Prophet of the ripening year. To thee of all things upon earth, Life is no longer than thy mirth. Insect truly blest! for thou Dost neither age nor winter know; But, when thou hast danc'd and sung Thy fill, the flowers and leaves among, Sated with thy Summer feast Thou retir'st to endless rest. THE SQUIRREL. The Squirrel, with aspiring mind, Disdains to be to earth confin'd, But mounts aloft in air: The pine-tree's giddiest height he climbs, Or scales the beech-tree's loftiest limbs, And builds his castle there. As Nature's wildest tenants free, A merry forester is he, In oak o'ershadow'd dells, Or glen remote, or woodland lawn, Where the doe hides her infant fawn, Among the birds he dwells. Within some old fantastic tree, Where time has worn a cavity, His winter food is stor'd: The cone beset with many a scale, The chesnut in its coat of mail, Or nuts complete his hoard. And of wise prescience thus possess'd, He near it rears his airy nest, With twigs and moss entwin'd, And gives its roof a conic form, Where safely shelter'd from the storm He braves the rain and wind. Though plumeless, he can dart away, Swift as the woodpecker or jay, His sportive mate to woo: His Summer food is berries wild, And last year's acorn cups are fill'd For him with sparkling dew. Soft is his shining auburn coat, As ermine white his downy throat, Intelligent his mien; With feathery tail and ears alert, And little paws as hands expert, And eyes so black and keen. Soaring above the earth-born herd Of beasts, he emulates the bird, Yet feels no want of wings: Exactly pois'd, he dares to launch In air, and bounds from branch to branch With swift elastic springs. And thus the Man of mental worth May rise above the humblest birth, And adverse Fate control; If to the upright heart be join'd The active persevering mind, And firm unshaken Soul. THE GLOW-WORM. Bright insect! that on humid leaves and grass Lights up thy fairy lamp; as if to guide The steps of labouring swains that homeward pass, Well pleas'd to see thee chear the pathway side, Betokening cloudless skies and pleasant days; While he whom evening's sober charms invite In shady woodlanes, often stops to gaze, And moralizing hails thy emerald light! On the fair tresses of the roseate morn, Translucent dews, as precious gems appear, Not less dost thou the night's dark hour adorn, “Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.” Though the rude bramble, or the fan-like ferns, Around thee their o'ershadowing branches spread, Steady and clear thy phosphor brilliance burns, And thy soft rays illuminate the shade. Thus the calm brightness of superior minds Makes them amid misfortune's shadow blest, And thus the radiant spark of Genius shines, Though skreen'd by Envy, or by Pride oppress'd. CONVERSATION THE FOURTH. TO A BUTTERFLY IN A WINDOW. Escaped thy place of wintry rest, And in the brightest colours drest, Thy new-born wings prepared for flight, Ah! do not, Butterfly, in vain Thus flutter on the crystal pane, But go! and soar to life and light. High on the buoyant Summer gale Thro' cloudless ether thou may'st sail, Or rest among the fairest flowers; To meet thy winnowing friends may'st speed, Or at thy choice luxurious feed In woodlands wild, or garden bowers. Beneath some leaf of ample shade Thy pearly eggs shall then be laid, Small rudiments of many a fly; While thou, thy frail existence past, Shall shudder in the chilly blast, And fold thy painted wings and die! Soon fleets thy transient life away; Yet short as is thy vital day, Like flowers that form thy fragrant food; Thou, poor Ephemeron, shalt have filled The little space thy Maker willed, And all thou know'st of life be good. WILD FLOWERS. Fair rising from her icy couch, Wan herald of the floral year, The Snow-drop marks the Spring's approach, E'er yet the Primrose groups appear, Or peers the Arum from its spotted veil, Or odorous Violets scent the cold capricious gale. Then thickly strewn in woodland bowers Anemonies their stars unfold; There spring the Sorrel's veined flowers, And rich in vegetable gold From calyx pale, the freckled Cowslip born, Receives in amber cups the fragrant dews of morn. Lo! the green Thorn her silver buds Expands, to May's enlivening beam; Hottonia blushes on the floods; And where the slowly trickling stream Mid grass and spiry rushes stealing glides, Her lovely fringed flowers fair Menyanthes hides. In the lone copse or shadowy dale, Wild cluster'd knots of Harebells blow, And droops the Lily of the vale O'er Vinca's matted leaves below, The Orchis race with varied beauty charm, And mock the exploring bee, or fly's aerial form. Wound in the hedgerow's oaken boughs, The Woodbine's tassels float in air, And blushing, the uncultured Rose Hangs high her beauteous blossoms there; Her fillets there the purple Nightshade weaves, And the Brionia winds her pale and scolloped leaves. To later Summer's fragrant breath Clemati's feathery garlands dance; The hollow Foxglove nods beneath, While the tall Mullein's yellow lance, Dear to the meally tribe of evening, towers, And the weak Galium weaves its myriad fairy flowers. Sheltering the coot's or wild duck's nest, And where the timid halcyon hides, The Willow-herb, in crimson drest, Waves with Arundo o'er the tides; And there the bright Nymphea loves to lave, Or spreads her golden orbs upon the dimpling wave. And thou! by pain and sorrow blest, Papaver! that an opiate dew Conceal'st beneath thy scarlet vest, Contrasting with the Corn flower blue, Autumnal months behold thy gauzy leaves Bend in the rustling gale, amid the tawny sheaves. From the first bud whose venturous head The Winter's lingering tempest braves, To those which mid the foliage dead Sink latest to their annual grave, All are for food, for health, or pleasure given, And speak in various ways the bounteous hand of Heaven. THE HOT-HOUSE ROSE. An early Rose borne from her genial bower Met the fond homage of admiring eyes, And while young Zephyr fann'd the lovely flower, Nature and Art contended for the prize. Exulting Nature cried, I made thee fair, 'Twas I that nursed thy tender buds in dew; I gave thee fragrance to perfume the air, And stole from beauty's cheek her blushing hue. Vainly fastidious novelty affects O'er alpine heights and untrod wilds to roam, From rocks and swamps her foreign plants collects, And brings the rare but scentless treasures home. Midst Art's factitious children let them be In sickly state by names pedantic known, True taste's unbiassed eye shall turn to thee, And love and beauty mark thee for their own. Cease goddess, cease, indignant Art replied, And e'er you triumph, know that but for me This beauteous object of our mutual pride Had been no other than a vulgar tree. I snatched her from her tardy mother's arms, Where sun-beams scorch and piercing tempests blow; On my warm bosom nursed her infant charms, Pruned the wild shoot, and trained the straggling bough. I watched her tender buds, and from her shade Drew each intruding weed with anxious care, Nor let the curling blight her leaves invade, Nor worm nor noxious insect harbour there; At length the beauty's loveliest bloom appears, And Art from Fame shall win the promised boon, While wayward April smiling through her tears Decks her fair tresses with the wreaths of June. Then jealous Nature, yield the palm to me, To me thy pride its early triumph owes; Though thy rude workmanship produced the tree, 'Twas Education formed the perfect Rose! CONVERSATION THE FIFTH. THE ROBIN'S PETITION. “A suppliant to your window comes, “Who trusts your faith and fears no guile, “He claims admittance for your crumbs, “And reads his passport in your smile. “For cold and cheerless is the day, “And he has sought the hedges round; “No berry hangs upon the spray, “Nor worm nor ant-egg can be found. “Secure his suit will be preferr'd, “No fears his slender feet deter; “For sacred is the household bird “That wears the scarlet stomacher.” Lucy the prayer assenting heard, The feather'd suppliant flew to her, And fondly cherish'd was the bird, That wears the scarlet stomacher. Embolden'd then, he'd fearless perch Her netting or her work among, For crumbs among her drawings search, And add his music to her song; And warbling on her snowy arm, Or half entangled in her hair, Seemed conscious of the double charm Of freedom, and protection there. A graver moralist, who used From all some lesson to infer, Thus said, as on the bird she mused, Pluming his scarlet stomacher— “Where are his gay companions now, “Who sung so merrily in Spring? “Some shivering on the leafless bough, “With ruffled plume, and drooping wing. “Some in the hollow of a cave, “Consign'd to temporary death; “And some beneath the sluggish wave “Await reviving nature's breath. “The migrant tribes are fled away, “To skies were insect myriads swarm, “They vanish with the Summer day, “Nor bide the bitter northern storm. “But still is this sweet minstrel heard, “While lours December dark and drear, “The social, chearful, household bird, “That wears the scarlet stomacher. “And thus in life's propitious hour, “Approving flatterers round us sport, “But if the faithless prospect lour, “They the more happy fly to court. THE CAPTIVE FLY. Seduced by idle change and luxury, See in vain struggles the expiring fly, He perishes! for lo, in evil hour, He rushed to taste of yonder garish flower, Which in young beauty's loveliest colours drest, Conceals destruction in her treacherous breast, While round the roseate chalice odours breathe, And lure the wanderer to voluptuous death. Ill-fated vagrant! did no instinct cry, Shun the sweet mischief?—No experienc'd fly Bid thee of this fair smiling fiend beware, And say, the false Apocynum is there? Ah wherefore quit for this Circean draught The Bean's ambrosial flower, with incense fraught, Or where with promise rich, Fragaria spreads Her spangling blossoms on her leafy beds; Could thy wild flight no softer blooms detain? And tower'd the Lilac's purple groups in vain? Or waving showers of golden blossoms, where Laburnum's pensile tassels float in air, When thou within those topaz keels might creep Secure, and rock'd by lulling winds to sleep. But now no more for thee shall June unclose Her spicey Clove-pink, and her damask Rose; Not for thy food shall swell the downy Peach, Nor Raspberries blush beneath the embowering Beech. In efforts vain thy fragile wings are torn, Sharp with distress resounds thy small shrill horn, While thy gay happy comrades hear thy cry, Yet heed thee not, and careless frolic by, Till thou, sad victim, every struggle o'er, Despairing sink, and feel thy fate no more. An insect lost should thus the muse bewail? Ah no! but 'tis the moral points the tale From the mild friend, who seeks with candid truth To show its errors to presumptuous Youth; From the fond caution of parental care, Whose watchful love detects the hidden snare, How do the Young reject, with proud disdain, Wisdom's firm voice, and Reason's prudent rein, And urge, on pleasure bent, the impetuous way, Heedless of all but of the present day, Then while false meteor-lights their steps entice, They taste, they drink, the empoisoned cup of vice; Till misery follows; and too late they mourn, Lost in the fatal gulph, from whence there's no return. THE CRICKET. Little inmate full of mirth, Chirping on my humble hearth, Wheresoe'er be thine abode, Always harbinger of good, Pay me for thy warm retreat With a song most soft and sweet, In return thou shalt receive Such a song as I can give. Though in voice and shape they be Form'd as if akin to thee, Thou surpassest, happier far, Happiest Grasshoppers that are; Theirs is but a Summer song, Thine endures the Winter long, Unimpair'd, and shrill and clear, Melody throughout the year. Neither night nor dawn of day Puts a period to thy lay. Then Insect! let thy simple song Chear the Winter evening long, While seeure from every storm, In my cottage snug and warm, Thou shalt my merry minstrel be, And I delight to shelter thee. THE CLOSE OF SUMMER. Farewell ye banks, where late the primrose growing, Among fresh leaves its pallid stars display'd, And the ground-ivy's balmy flowers blowing, Trail'd their festoons along the grassy shade. Farewell! to richer scenes and Summer pleasures, Hedge-rows, engarlanded with many a wreath, Where the wild roses hang their blushing treasures, And to the evening gale the woodbines breathe. Farewell! the meadows, where such various showers Of beauty lurked, among the fragrant hay; Where orchis bloomed with freak'd and spotted flowers, And lychnis blushing like the new born day. The burning dog-star, and the insatiate mower, Have swept or wither'd all this floral pride; And mullein's now, or bugloss' lingering flower, Scarce cheer the green lane's parched and dusty side. His busy sickle now the months-man wielding, Close are the light and fragile poppies shorn, And while the golden ears their stores are yielding, The azure corn-flowers fall among the corn. The woods are silent too, where loudly flinging Wild notes of rapture to the western gale, A thousand birds their hymns of joy were singing, And bade the enchanting hours of Spring time hail! The stock-dove now is heard, in plaintive measure, The cricket shrill, and wether's drowsy bell, But to the sounds and scents of vernal pleasure, Music and dewy airs, a long farewell! Yet tho' no beauteous wreaths adorn the season, Nor birds sing blythe, nor sweets the winds diffuse, This riper period, like the age of reason, Tho' stript of loveliness, is rich in use. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. CONVERSATION THE SIXTH. SONNET TO THE INSECT OF THE GOSSAMER. Small, viewless aeronaut, that by the line Of Gossamer suspended, in mid air Float'st on a sun-beam—Living atom, where Ends thy breeze-guided voyage? With what design In æther dost thou launch thy form minute, Mocking the eye? Alas! before the veil Of denser clouds shall hide thee, the pursuit Of the keen Swift may end thy fairy sail! Thus on the golden thread that Fancy weaves Buoyant, as Hope's illusive flattery breathes, The young and visionary Poet leaves Life's dull realities, while sevenfold wreaths Of rainbow light around his head revolve. Ah! soon at Sorrow's touch the radiant dreams dissolve. THE NAUTILUS. Where southern suns and winds prevail, And undulate the Summer seas; The Nautilus expands his sail, And scuds before the fresh'ning breeze. Oft is a little squadron seen Of mimic ships all rigg'd complete; Fancy might think the fairy queen Was sailing with her elfin fleet. With how much beauty is design'd Each channell'd bark of purest white! With orient pearl each cabin lined, Varying with every change of light. While with his little slender oars, His silken sail, and tapering mast, The dauntless mariner explores The dangers of the watery waste. Prepared, should tempests rend the sky, From harm his fragile bark to keep, He furls his sail, his oar lays by, And seeks his safety in the deep, Then safe on ocean's shelly bed, He hears the storm above him roar; Mid groves of coral glowing red, Or rocks o'erhung with madrepore. So let us catch life's favouring gale, But if fate's adverse winds be rude, Take calmly in th'adventurous sail, And find repose in Solitude. THE WHEAT-EAR. From that deep shelter'd solitude, Where in some quarry wild and rude, Your feather'd mother reared her brood, Why, pilgrim, did you brave The upland winds so bleak and keen, To seek these hills?—whose slopes between Wide stretch'd in grey expanse is seen, The Ocean's toiling wave? Did instinct bid you linger here, That broad and restless Ocean near, And wait, till with the waning year Those northern gales arise, Which, from the tall cliff's rugged side Shall give your soft light plumes to glide, Across the channel's refluent tide, To seek more favoring skies? Alas! and has not instinct said That luxury's toils for you are laid, And that by groundless fears betray'd You ne'er perhaps may know Those regions, where the embowering vine Loves round the luscious fig to twine, And mild the Suns of Winter shine, And flowers perennial blow To take you, shepherd boys prepare The hollow turf, the wiry snare, Of those weak terrors well aware, That bid you vainly dread The shadows floating o'er the downs, Or murmuring gale, that round the stones Of some old beacon, as it moans, Scarce moves the thistle's head. And if a cloud obscure the Sun With faint and fluttering heart you run, And to the pitfall you should shun Resort in trembling haste; While, on that dewy cloud so high, The lark, sweet minstrel of the sky, Sings in the morning's beamy eye, And bathes his spotted breast. Ah! simple bird, resembling you Are those, that with distorted view Thro' life some selfish end pursue, With low inglorious aim; They sink in blank oblivious night, While minds superior dare the light, And high on honor's glorious height Aspire to endless fame! AN EVENING WALK BY THE SEA SIDE. 'Tis pleasant to wander along on the sand, Beneath the high cliff that is hallowed in caves; When the fisher has put off his boat from the land, And the prawn-catcher wades thro' the short rippling waves. While fast run before us the sandling and plover, Intent on the crabs and the sand-eels to feed, And here on a rock which the tide will soon cover, We'll find us a seat that is tapestried with weed. Bright gleam the white sails in the slant rays of even, And stud as with silver the broad level main, While glowing clouds float on the fair face of Heaven, And the mirror-like water reflects them again. How various the shades of marine vegetation, Thrown here the rough flints and the pebbles among, The feather'd conferva of deepest carnation, The dark purple slake and the olive sea thong. While Flora herself unreluctantly mingles Her garlands with those that the Nereids have worn, For the yellow horned poppy springs up on the shingles, And convolvulas rival the rays of the morn. But now to retire from the rock we have warning, Already the water encircles our seat, And slowly the tide of the evening returning, The moon beams reflects in the waves at our feet. Ah! whether as now the mild Summer sea flowing, Scarce wrinkles the sands as it murmurs on shore, Or fierce wintry whirlwinds impetuously blowing Bid high maddening surges resistlessly roar; That Power, which can put the wide waters in motion, Then bid the vast billows repose at His word; Fills the mind with deep reverence, while Earth, Air, and Ocean, Alike of the universe speak him the Lord. CONVERSATION THE SEVENTH. THE HUMMING BIRD. Minutest of the feather'd kind, Possessing every charm combin'd, Nature, in forming thee, design'd That thou should'st be A proof within how little space, She can comprise such perfect grace, Rendering thy lovely fairy race, Beauty's epitome. Those burnish'd colours to bestow, Her pencil in the heavenly bow She dipp'd; and made thy plumes to glow With every hue That in the dancing sun-beam plays; And with the ruby's vivid blaze, Mingled the emerald's lucid rays With halcyon blue. Then placed thee under genial skies, Where flowers and shrubs spontaneous rise, With richer fragrance, bolder dyes, By her endued; And bade thee pass thy happy hours In tamarind shades, and palmy bowers, Extracting from unfailing flowers Ambrosial food. There, lovely Bee-bird! may'st thou rove Thro' spicy vale, and citron grove, And woo, and win thy fluttering love With plume so bright; There rapid fly, more heard than seen, Mid orange-boughs of polished green, With glowing fruit, and flowers between Of purest white. There feed, and take thy balmy rest, There weave thy little cotton nest, And may no cruel hand molest Thy timid bride; Nor those bright changeful plumes of thine Be offer'd on the unfeeling shrine, Where some dark beauty loves to shine In gaudy pride. Nor may her sable lover's care Add to the baubles in her hair Thy dazzling feathers rich and rare; And thou, poor bird, For this inhuman purpose bleed; While gentle hearts abhor the deed, And mercy's trembling voice may plead, But plead unheard! Such triflers should be taught to know, Not all the hues thy plumes can show Become them like the conscious glow Of modesty: And that not half so lovely seems The ray that from the diamond gleams, As the pure gem that trembling beams In pity's eye! THE HEATH. Even the wide Heath, where the unequal ground Has never on its rugged surface felt The hand of Industry, though wild and rough, Is not without its beauty; here the furze, Enrich'd among its spines, with golden flowers Scents the keen air; while all its thorny groups Wide scatter'd o'er the waste are full of life; For 'midst its yellow bloom, the assembled chats Wave high the tremulous wing, and with shrill notes, But clear and pleasant, cheer the extensive heath. Linnets in numerous flocks frequent it too, And bashful, hiding in these scenes remote From his congeners, (they who make the woods And the thick copses echo to their song) The heath-thrush makes his domicile; and while His patient mate with downy bosom warms Their future nestlings, he his love lay sings Loud to the shaggy wild—The Erica here, That o'er the Caledonian hills sublime Spreads its dark mantle, (where the bees delight To seek their purest honey,) flourishes, Sometimes with bells like Amethysts, and then Paler, and shaded like the maiden's cheek With gradual blushes—Other while, as white, As rime that hangs upon the frozen spray. Of this, old Scotia's hardy mountaineers Their rustic couches form; and there enjoy Sleep, which beneath his velvet canopy Luxurious idleness implores in vain! Between the matted heath and ragged gorse Wind natural walks of turf, as short and fine As clothe the chalky downs; and there the sheep Under some thorny bush, or where the fern Lends a light shadow from the Sun, resort, And ruminate or feed; and frequent there Nourish'd by evening mists, the mushroom spreads From a small ivory bulb, his circular roof The fairies fabled board—Poor is the soil, And of the plants that clothe it few possess Succulent moisture; yet a parasite Clings even to them; for its entangling stalk The wire like dodder winds; and nourishes, Rootless itself, its small white flowers on them. So to the most unhappy of our race Those, on whom never prosperous hour has smiled, Towards whom Nature as a step-dame stern Has cruelly dealt; and whom the world rejects To these forlorn ones, ever there adheres Some self-consoling passion; round their hearts Some vanity entwines itself; and hides, And is perhaps in mercy given to hide, The mortifying sad realities Of their hard lot. ODE TO THE MISSEL THRUSH The Winter Solstice scarce is past, Loud is the wind, and hoarsely sound The mill-streams in the swelling blast, And cold and humid is the ground. When, to the ivy, that embowers Some pollard tree, or sheltering rock The troop of timid warblers flock, And shuddering wait for milder hours. While thou! the leader of their band, Fearless salut'st the opening year; Nor stay'st, till blow the breezes bland That bid the tender leaves appear: But, on some towering elm or pine, Waving elate thy dauntless wing, Thou joy'st thy love notes wild to sing, Impatient of St. Valentine! Oh, herald of the Spring! while yet No harebell scents the woodland lane, Nor starwort fair, nor violet, Braves the bleak gust and driving rain, 'Tis thine, as thro' the copses rude Some pensive wanderer sighs along, To sooth him with thy chearful song, And tell of Hope and Fortitude! For thee then, may the hawthorn bush, The elder, and the spindle tree, With all their various berries blush, And the blue sloe abound for thee! For thee, the coral holly glow Its arm'd and glossy leaves among, And many a branched oak be hung With thy pellucid missletoe. Still may thy nest, with lichen lined, Be hidden from the invading jay, Nor truant boy its covert find, To bear thy callow young away; So thou, precursor still of good, O, herald of approaching Spring, Shalt to the pensive wanderer sing Thy song of Hope and Fortitude! ODE TO THE OLIVE TREE. Altho' thy flowers minute, disclose No colours rivalling the rose, And lend no odours to the gale; While dimly thro' the pallid green Of thy long slender leaves, are seen Thy berries pale. Yet for thy virtues art thou known, And not the Anana's burnish'd cone, Or golden fruits that bless the earth Of Indian climes, however fair, Can with thy modest boughs compare, For genuine worth. Man, from his early Eden driven, Receiv'd thee from relenting Heaven, And thou the whelming surge above, Symbol of pardon, deign'd to rear Alone thy willowy head, to cheer The wandering dove. Tho' no green whispering shade is thine, Where peasant girls at noon recline, Or, while the village tabor plays, Gay vine-dressers, and goatherds, meet To dance with light unwearied feet On holidays; Yet doth the fruit thy sprays produce, Supply what ardent Suns refuse, Nor want of grassy lawn or mead, To pasture milky herds, is found, While fertile Olive groves surround The lone Bastide. Thou stillest the wild and troubled waves, And as the human tempest raves When Wisdom bids the tumult cease; Thee, round her calm majestic brows She binds; and waves thy sacred boughs, Emblems of Peace! Ah! then, tho' thy wan blossoms bear No odours for the vagrant air, Yet genuine worth belongs to thee; And Peace and Wisdom, powers divine, Shall plant thee round the holy shrine Of Liberty! CONVERSATION THE EIGHTH. ON SCARING SOME WATER-FOWL IN LOCH TURIT. A WILD SCENE AMONG THE HILLS OF OUGHTER-TYRE. George.— Why, ye tenants of the lake, For me your watry haunts forsake? Tell me, fellow-creatures, why At my presence thus you fly? Why disturb your social joys, Parent, filial, kindred ties? Common friend to you and me, Nature's gifts to all are free: Peaceful keep your dimpling wave, Busy feed, or wanton lave; Or, beneath the sheltering rock, Bide the surging billows shock. Conscious, blushing for our race, Soon, too soon, your fears I trace; Man, your proud usurping foe, Would-be lord of all below— Plumes himself in Freedom's pride, Tyrant stern to all beside. The Eagle from the cliffy brow, Marking you his prey below, In his breast no pity dwells, Strong necessity compels. But Man, to whom, alone is given A ray direct from pitying Heaven, Glories in his heart humane, And creatures for his pleasure slain. In these savage liquid plains, Only known to wandering swains, Where the mossy rivulet strays, Far from human haunts and ways; All on Nature you depend, And life's poor season peaceful spend. Or if Man's superior might, Dare invade your native right, On the lofty ether borne, Man with all his powers you scorn; Swiftly seek on clanging wings, Other lakes and other springs, And the foe you cannot brave, Scorn at least to be his slave. TO THE FIRE-FLY OF JAMAICA, SEEN IN A COLLECTION. How art thou alter'd! since afar, Thou seem'dst a bright earth wandering star; When thy living lustre ran, Tall majestic trees between, And Guazume, or Swietan, Or the Pimento's glossy green, As caught their varnish'd leaves, thy glancing light Reflected flying fires, amid the moonless night. From shady heights, where currents spring, Where the ground dove dips her wing, Winds of night reviving blow, Thro' rustling fields of maize and cane, And wave the Coffee's fragrant bough; But winds of night, for thee in vain May breathe, of the Plumeria's luscious bloom, Or Granate's scarlet buds, or Plinia's mild perfume. The recent captive, who in vain, Attempts to break his heavy chain, And find his liberty in flight; Shall no more in terror hide, From thy strange and doubtful light, In the mountain's cavern'd side, Or gully deep, where gibbering monkies cling, And broods the giant bat, on dark funereal wing. Nor thee his darkling steps to aid, Thro' the forests pathles shade, Shall the sighing Slave invoke; Who, his daily task perform'd, Would forget his heavy yoke; And by fond affections warm'd, Glide to some dear sequester'd spot, to prove, Friendship's consoling voice, or sympathising love. Now, when sinks the Sun away, And fades at once the sultry day, Thee, as falls the sudden night, Never Naturalist shall view, Dart with corruscation bright, Down the coco avenue; Or see thee give, with transient gleams to glow, The green Banana's head, or Shaddock's loaded bough. Ah! never more shalt thou behold, The midnight Beauty, slow unfold Her golden zone, and thro' the gloom To thee her radiant leaves display, More lovely than the roseate bloom Of flowers, that drink the tropic day; And while thy dancing flames around her blaze, Shed odours more refin'd, and beam with brighter rays. The glass thy faded form contains, But of thy lamp no spark remains; That lamp, which through the palmy grove, Floated once with sapphire beam, As lucid as the star of Love, Reflected in the bickering stream; Transient and bright! so human meteors rise, And glare and sink, in pensive Reason's eyes. Ye dazzling comets that appear In Fashion's rainbow atmosphere, Lightning and flashing for a day; Think ye, how fugitive your fame? How soon from her light scroll away, Is wafted your ephemeron name? Even tho' on canvas still your forms are shewn, Or the slow chisel shapes the pale resembling stone. Let vaunting Ostentation trust The pencil's art, or marble bust, While long neglected modest worth, Unmark'd, unhonor'd, and unknown, Obtains at length a little earth, Where kindred merit weeps alone; Yet there, tho' Vanity no trophies rear, Is Friendship's long regret, and true Affection's tear! VERSES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING. As in the woods, where leathery lichen weaves Its wintry web among the sallow leaves, Which (thro' cold months in whirling eddies blown,) Decay beneath the branches once their own. From the brown shelter of their foliage sear, Spring the young blooms that lead the floral year, When waked by vernal Suns, the Pilewort dares, Expand her clouded leaves and shining stars; And, veins empurpling all her tassels pale, Bends the soft wind-flower in the vernal gale. Uncultured bells of azure jacinths blow, And the breeze scenting violet lurks below. So views the Wanderer, with delighted eyes, Reviving hopes from black despondence rise; When blighted by Adversity's chill breath, Those hopes had felt a temporary death; Then with gay heart he looks to future hours, When Love and Friendship dress the summer bowers; And, as delicious dreams enchant his mind, Forgets his sorrows past, and gives them to the wind. LINES COMPOSED IN PASSING THRO' A FOREST IN GERMANY. If, when to-morrow's Sun, with upward ray, Gilds the wide spreading oak, and burnish'd pine, Destin'd to mingle here with foreign clay, Pale, cold, and still, should sleep this form of mine; The Day-star, with as lustrous warmth would glow, And thro' the ferny lairs and forest shades, With sweetest woodscents fraught, the air would blow, And timid wild deer, bound along the glades; While in a few short months, to clothe the mould, Would velvet moss and purple melic rise, By Heaven's pure dew drops water'd, clear and cold, And birds innumerous sing my obsequies; But, in my native land, no faithful maid To mourn for me, would pleasure's orgies shun; No sister's love my long delay upbraid; No mother's anxious love demand her son. Thou, only thou, my friend, would feel regret, My blighted hopes and early fate deplore; And, while my faults thou'dst palliate or forget, Would half rejoice, I felt that fate no more. TO A GERANIUM WHICH FLOWERED DURING THE WINTER. WRITTEN IN AUTUMN. Native of Afric's arid lands, Thou, and thy many-tinctur'd bands, Unheeded and unvalued grew, While Caffres crush'd beneath the sands Thy pencil'd flowers of roseate hue. But our cold northern sky beneath, For thee attemper'd zephyrs breathe, And art supplies the tepid dew, That feeds, in many a glowing wreath, Thy lovely flowers of roseate hue. Thy race, that spring uncultur'd here, Decline with the declining year, While in successive beauty new, Thine own light bouquets fresh appear, And marbled leaves of cheerful hue. Now buds and bells of every shade, By Summer's ardent eye survey'd, No more their gorgeous colours shew; And even the lingering asters fade, With drooping heads of purple hue. But naturalized in foreign earth, 'Tis thine, with many a beauteous birth, As if in gratitude they blew, To hang, like blushing trophies forth, Thy pencill'd flowers of roseate hue. Oh then, amidst the wintry gloom, Those flowers shall dress my cottage room, Like friends in adverse fortune true; And soothe me with their roseate bloom, And downy leaves of vernal hue. CONVERSATION THE NINTH. TO THE MULBERRY-TREE. ON READING THE ORIENTAL APHORISM, “BY PATIENCE AND LABOUR THE MULBERRY-LEAF BECOMES SATIN.” Hither, in half blown garlands drest, Advances the reluctant Spring, And shrinking, feels her tender breast Chill'd by Winter's snowy wing; Nor wilt thou, alien as thou art, display Or leaf, or swelling bud, to meet the varying day. Yet, when the mother of the rose, Bright June, leads on the glowing hours, And from her hands luxuriant throws Her lovely groups of Summer flowers; Forth from thy brown and unclad branches shoot Serrated leaves and rudiments of fruit. And soon those boughs umbrageous spread A shelter from Autumnal rays, While gay beneath thy shadowy head, His gambols happy childhood plays; Eager, with crimson fingers to amass Thy ruby fruit, that strews the turfy grass. But where, festoon'd with purple vines, More freely grows thy graceful form, And skreen'd by towering Appenines, Thy foliage feeds the spinning worm; Patience and Industry protect thy shade, And see, by future looms, their care repaid. They mark the threads, half viewless wind That form the shining light cocoon, Now tinted as the orange rind, Or paler than the pearly moon; Then at their summons in the task engage, Ligh active youth, and tremulous old age. The task that bids thy tresses green A thousand varied hues assume, There colour'd like the sky serene, And mocking here the roses bloom; And now, in lucid volumes lightly roll'd, Where purple clouds are starr'd with mimic gold. But not because thy veined leaves, Do to the grey winged moth supply The nutriment, whence Patience weaves The monarch's velvet canopy; Thro' his high domes, a splendid radiance throws, And binds the jewell'd circlet on his brows; And not, that thus transform'd, thy boughs, Now as a cestus clasp the fair, Now in her changeful vestment flows, And filets now her plaited hair; I praise thee; but that I behold in thee The triumph of unwearied Industry. 'Tis, that laborious millions owe To thee, the source of simple food In Eastern climes; or where the Po Reflects thee from his classic flood; While useless Indollnce may blush, to view What Patience, Industry, and Art, can do. THE CANKERED ROSE. As Spring to Summer hours gave way, And June approach'd, beneath whose sway My lovely Fanny saw the day, I mark'd each blossom'd bower, And bade each plant its charms display, To crown the favour'd hour. The favour'd hour to me so bright, When Fanny first beheld the light, And I should many a bloom unite, A votive wreath to twine, And with the lily's virgin white, More glowing hues combine. A wreath that, while I hail'd the day, All the fond things I meant, might say (As Indian maids their thoughts array, By artful quipo's wove;) And fragrant symbols thus convey My tenderness and love. For this I sought where long had grown, A rosarie I call'd my own, Whose rich unrivall'd flowers were known The earliest to unclose, And where I hoped would soon be blown, The first and fairest Rose. An infant bud there cradled lay, Mid new born leaves; and seem'd to stay Till June should call, with warmer ray, It's embryo beauty forth; Reserv'd for that propitious day That gave my Fanny birth. At early morning's dewy hour, I watch'd it in its leafy bower, And heard with dread the sleety shower, When eastern tempests blew, But still unhurt my favourite flower With fairer promise grew. From rains and breezes sharp and bleak, Secur'd, I saw its calyx break, And soon a lovely blushing streak The latent bloom betray'd; (Such colours on my Fanny's cheek, Has cunning Nature laid.) Illusive hope! The day arriv'd, I saw my cherish'd rose—It lived, But of its early charms depriv'd, No odours could impart; And scarce with sullied leaves, surviv'd The canker at its heart. There unsuspected, long had fed A noxious worm, and mining spread, The dark pollution o'er its head, That drooping seem'd to mourn Its fragrance pure, and petals red, Destroy'd e'er fully born. Unfinish'd now, and incomplete, My garland lay at Fanny's feet, She smil'd;—ah could I then repeat What youth so little knows, How the too trusting heart must beat With pain, when treachery and deceit In some insidious form, defeat Its fairest hopes; as cankers eat The yet unfolded rose.</field>
