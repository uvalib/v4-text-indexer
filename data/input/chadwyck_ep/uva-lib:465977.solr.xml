      <field name="fulltext">‚ÄúGood Night! not Good-bye‚Äù (Her last words, March 15, 1889.) I saw my Lady die; And He, who ofttimes cruel is, dark Death, Was so deep-sorrowful to stay her breath, He came, all clemency: He would not let her know; So well he loved the bright soul he must take That, for our grieving, and her own fair sake, He hid his shaft and bow: Upon her lips he laid That ‚Äúkiss of God‚Äù which kills, but does not harm; With tender message, breathing no alarm, He said ‚ÄúBe unafraid!‚Äù Sorrow grew almost glad, Pain half-forgiven, parting well-nigh kind, To mark how placidly my Lady's mind Consented.‚ÄîReady-clad In robes of unseen light Her willing soul spread wing; and, while she passed, ‚ÄúDarling! good-bye!‚Äù we moaned‚Äîbut She, at last, Murmured ‚ÄúNo‚Äîbut Good-Night!‚Äù Good-night! then!‚ÄîSweetheart! Wife‚Äî If this world be the dark time, and its morrow Day-dawn of Paradise, dispelling sorrow, Lighting our starless Life. Good-night!‚Äîand not Good-bye! Good-night!‚Äîand best ‚ÄúGood-morrow!‚Äù if we wake; Yet, why so quickly tired? Well, we must make Haste to be done, and die! For dying has grown dear Now you are dead, who turned all things to grace; We see Death made pale slumber on your face; Good-night!‚ÄîBut is Dawn near?‚Äî Flowers rich of scent and hue We laid upon your sleeping-place. And these, Flowers of fond verse, which once had gift to please‚Äî Being your own‚Äîtake, too! INTRODUCTION. 'Twas I who sang how Sultan shah Jahan Built the white House of Death for Arjamand On Jumna's shore; how, From ‚ÄúWith S√°di, in the Garden.‚Äù ‚Äúall for lordly love, The marbles were Mukr√¢ni‚ÄîJeypore's best‚Äî Brought seventy koss in creaking cattle-wains; The sandstone Futtehpur's; how the gems came Over a hundred wastes, a thousand hills, By camel-caravan, ten thousand bales, From Balkh, Iran, and far-off Khorasan: What crores the Emperor lavished on his Taj; What lakhs of workmen toiled for what long years Accomplishing the Death-Place of his Queen: All for her love! Dying at Burhanpur, She spake to him: ‚ÄòOh, Sultan of the Age! Life of my soul! who lov'dst me so, and knowest How well I loved! now pass I, leaving thee Last child and latest kiss. Let all the world Know thy large love and mine, and build for me For Mumtaz dead, thy Persian wife, a Tomb Which earth shall marvel at, and all men laud, Extolling thee and not forgetting me.‚Äô And Jahan cried: ‚ÄòYea! but, by God the Truth! This thing shall be; the world shall know of thee; Thou shalt have such a tomb!‚Äô Whereon she died, And Shah Jahan builded the Taj Mahal.‚Äù So did I sing the Sultan's lordliness. But you‚Äîmy Arjamand, my bright One, lost! My New-World Wife! my Lady of the West, Who, from so far-off, came to be so near‚Äî No snow-white marble blocks have I to pile, No throng of wise artificers to toil, No kingdom's treasures at thy grave to pour As gold were safflower, as if silver were Jungle-blooms stripped, and jewels fountain-drops. Only these jewels ‚ÄúThe Casket of Gems.‚Äù have I, which were cut White from the mind, and blood-red from the heart; Only my verses have I, which I built Line by line, for thee living, and now roof With sorrowful last words, and coping-stones Of fond farewell. Yet sleep not thou o'er-humbled! It may be these shall last when those are crumbled. THE CASKET OF GEMS. [Partly Written in 1870.] ‚Äú‚ÄîBut your name men shall know, Reading these jewelled letters which compose Its gentle music; for my verse will go‚Äî Glad with the light of Love and you‚Äîto days When better poets live, and Life, made strong By sheaves of our sad sowing-time, shall praise Ladies we sang, and graces of our song.‚Äù ‚ÄîVid. page 118. [Deign, Sweetheart! deign to take what true love sends] Deign, Sweetheart! deign to take what true love sends, Its daily gift set fair in gentle song; Where‚Äîif verse fail‚Äîheart's faith would make amends, So earnest, speech, at best, must do it wrong. All lonely as I sit, a fancy raised Lightens the heavy hour's dull incompleteness:‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy is she sweet and good save to be praised, Or I a singer save to praise her sweetness?‚Äù Some whisper from the Silence! Who can say? Poets, before, have found new music so! At least, hereby, what I thought, day by day, Your eyes will read, and tender breast will know. And all spheres, Dear! are servants unto Love; And all things in the world obey a Poet; And once‚Äîthey say‚Äîthe letter Yod did move, And cried aloud to Heav'n‚ÄîMishna doth show it! Therefore I bid these Letters‚Äîeach of them‚Äî Be messengers of splendour to you now; Each minion casting at your feet some gem Worthy your white neck, or your arm, or brow. If one should falter‚Äîif one fail herein‚Äî Denounce the traitor! It shall surely bring Ill to that slave, as when an Arab Djin Vexed Suleiman, or mocked Aladdin's ring! F. [Fire-opals, Fanny, from the magic cell!] Fire-opals, Fanny, from the magic cell! First of my alchemy, but not its best‚Äî Let me lay these upon your hands, and tell Why they seem not unworthy there to rest. For since God chained, in nether rock and bluff, Those radiant, sinful Angels, rebel found, Were ever‚Äîin the midst of dead dull stuff‚Äî Such burning, flashing beams of glory bound? I think a broken rainbow would look so, If we could come at it, and steal a tittle When the Arch-Architects of air forego Their work, and leave it drifting loose a little. I pray you gaze a while on these lit stones By fancy fetched from Australasian steeps, Where moony pearl sets blazing scarlet tones, And pale gold melts to green, and amber leaps To bloomy violets; and celestial blues Flicker to rose and ruby. You shall turn Nowise these jewels, but their shifting hues To some new brilliancy will swiftly burn. So shall true lady bend no faithful love Toward some new need, but from its patient heart Rays of an unexpected light will move, And richer colours from its spirit start. Mark, also, when the ‚Äúnoble opal‚Äù feels Your palm's warm glow, its dancing beauties brighten: Breathe on this Hydrophane‚Äîthe rose-tint steals From point to point; and sea-green flashes lighten The sleeping flint! Or, lay this Hyalite One instant 'mid the laces of your dress, Then note its sudden splendours! So, 'tis right Love's colours be drawn forth by tenderness. Yet, here is why I prize the shifting gem, And why I lay it on that dear right hand, Of all earth's common things the core of them Is humblest: Sweetheart! pray you understand! Mean rubbish of the road-heaps; silicates Which gather in chalk-hollows, where, sea-bred, Millions of billons, tubes and tunicates Laid down their limy shells, Nature's small dead. Who would have thought there should be use, or other Service, for such lost Atoms of the main When, sinking through the seas, they give the Mother Their tiny life-garbs, to lay up again? But She,‚Äîwho hastes not, wastes not, scorns not‚Äîtakes it, Each relic of her nameless children gone, Stores her sea-oozes with their spoil, and makes it Chalk down, or marble vein, or quarry-stone. Till ages thence-of ruined nummulites, Pharaohs their pyramids majestic build; And Pheidias, from a tomb of trilobites, Calls Pallas forth, radiant with helm and shield! So this fair wonder; 'tis the draff of rock Melted in fires of under-world, or broken From snow-swept crag, or shorn in earthquake-shock; Of storm, and stress, and wreck the splintered token. And yet, because Day's white rays evermore Find their way back into such flinty things, They glow like Seraphs' feathers. None is poor! None mean! Heaven's light can make them mates for kings! A. [Herewith, an Amethystine Cup! see, Dear!] Herewith, an Amethystine Cup! see, Dear! How soft and pure the liquid purple swims! 'Tis the Maid's stone: she hath no fault or fear Whose untouched lips drink from such chalice-brims; Whose virginal cold fingers clasp this stem To quaff the sober wavelet of the streams; And, if she wear an Amethyst, the gem Keeps her sleep calm, and innocent her dreams. It should be coloured as though violet satin Changed to translucent crystal‚Äîwith clear glow Of rose-red 'gainst the Sun:‚Äîthe learn√´d Latin ‚ÄúEyelid of Venus‚Äù styles it, tinted so. Or you may wear Avanturine with spangles Of golden brown; or Chrysoprase which gleams Pale apple-green; or Rose-quartz that entangles Blushes of dawn, with white and lilac beams: Or Sard, the Carver's gem; or Bloodstone sombre Spotted from veins of Christ‚Äîthe legend says‚Äî Or Prase; or Plasma, sea-grey stained with umber; Or Chalcedony, quenching silver rays In milk. These all be sister-miracles Of Amethyst; treasures of gnomes, brought up From distant caverns where the chill snake dwells 'Mid poisonous flow'rs. Yet, most regard my cup Far-fetched and wonderful! If you would know Whence came so fair a work of mortal hands, Learn it lay buried many fathoms low Under a temple-tank in Indian lands. ≈ílian‚Äî‚Äúthe honey-tongued‚Äù‚Äîits story writes In pleasant Greek; one, named Heraclia,‚Äî A great Dame‚Äîin her Garden of Delights Saw a young stork fall on the public way: Some cruel arrow-barb had hurt its wing Spread for long flight to Coromandel's shore; Piteous, in dust and blood, the affrighted thing Lay:‚Äîbut she sped, and gathered it, and bore‚Äî Soft-folded on her breast‚Äîinto her bower; And there, with soothing balms and unguents strange, Healed his harsh wound, and gave him back the power Of those broad painted pinions, to outrange The flying crudded rack, poised in high air. Ah, the stork's happy cry when first he rose Over the city-roofs, and spied full clear His road athwart the blue‚Äîas a fowl goes On shoulder of West wind‚Äîto warm Malay! A little grieved she that her bird sprang forth So gladsome. Afterwards‚Äîon that same way‚Äî When Spring brings back the storks from South to North; While she did pace towards the Altar-stair, Out from the clouds that glad cry rang again: And lo! th' astonished people were aware Of a great fowl, which clanged, and left his train Of friends ranged wedge-wise. Lighting at her feet There he let fall this beauteous sculptured cup, And laid his neck against her bosom sweet For love of her: then, swiftly soaring up, Was never seen again! Heraclia Quaffed from no other vessel, all her life; And poisons could not harm her; nor‚Äîbooks say‚Äî Pains or plagues touch her; widow, maid, or wife! But when she died, and this rare goblet lay Beside her bier, there came a whirr of wing Under the marble porch; and bore away The precious gift. So fell it to the King Of Coromandel: and when he was slain In Chitt√ªr, some one hid it in the tank. I bade my minion fish it up again, And bear to thee. Drink as Heraclia drank! N. [Nephrite, herewith! the sea-green China Jade] Nephrite, herewith! the sea-green China Jade; A sacred stone! If you would magic try Carve 1. 8. 1. 1 on a square well-made, (Its demon-number) in the charactery Of hieroglyphs‚Äîfor Egypt knew this well And named it N√Ælion from her ancient river; In Babylon 'twas dedicate to Bel; Kings sealed decrees therewith; aye! and, or ever A Spaniard's eye from Darien surveyed‚Äî Amazed‚Äîthe blue Pacific's endlessness, Those feather-cinctured Aztecs worshipped Jade And graved their Gods upon it! Well!‚Äîimpress The figures; set it in pure gold, and breathe Thrice at the dawning on it, thrice at night, Repeating ‚ÄúThoth‚Äù five hundred times; then wreathe A red thread round it‚Äîafterwards no wight, Be he crowned Prince, or Lord, or Common man, Saith nay to any wish that shall arise! But you‚Äîyou smile! knowing how Woman can Weave stronger spells with jewels of her eyes. Leave, then, the amulet. Still,‚Äîif you take A bead of grey Jade, cut with Shiva's mark, 'Tis sure‚Äîby Hindoo mantras‚Äînot one snake Will dare to cross your pathway in the dark! You ‚Äúwill not walk,‚Äù say you, ‚Äúwhere such be found,‚Äù Eve of a safer Paradise?‚ÄîThen, see How daintily the pale green Nephrite-ground Backs the hot rubies in this jewellery Of Muslim art! An Amir's dagger-hilt, Patiently polished for his angry hand! Note how the damasked waving blade is built With blood-channels, and all its beauty planned To kill, kill, kill! exquisite devilry Of arabesques of death, wrought without joint 'Mid two pure rows of seed-pearls, running free Hither and thither in a slot; keen point Like a snake's tooth!

My slaves shall seek gifts in a gentler place. N. [Nacre, and Pearls of Ormuz, now I fetch] Nacre, and Pearls of Ormuz, now I fetch From the bright stores of Love's enchanted Palace: Know you, perchance, how that poor formless wretch‚Äî The Oyster‚Äîgems his shallow moonlit chalice? Where the shell irks him, or the sea-sand frets, There, from some subtle organ, he doth shed This lovely lustre on his grief, and gets Peace, and the world his labour, being dead. Ah, patient foolish fish of the Orient seas! What else do we, the Poets, serfs of men, But pour our souls out in soft verse, to ease Our aches, and die; and people make us then Wealth, whence they draw musical ornament For lovers' use, and sweet wise things to say; And wonder if the Lady did relent, Or keep the pearls, and throw the life away. For here be pearls, too; pearls of lucent ray For some one strung to mark her where she goes A Pearl of women; and when others say ‚ÄúOh, you glad Lady! who did give you those:‚Äî Pearls of white thought, pearls of a lasting love?‚Äù Then will you finger them on your fair throat, And answer: ‚ÄúThese came deeper than from grove Of sea-trees, green beneath the diver's boat! Full many a fathom down I hanselled them In heart of him who did not grudge, indeed; He would have melted Cleopatra's gem In wine of verse, if I had said ‚ÄòI need New splendours for my necklet?‚Äô On one day I did not know he lived; and that day's morrow I knew he loved me well; and thence‚Äîalway‚Äî I am his peace and pain, his crown and sorrow!‚Äù ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù they will cry, ‚Äúfor such strong faith, Pardie! We, now, had shown great favour; pearls are much!‚Äù But thou, wear, and speak nought!‚ÄîI give them thee Free of all price, and a king's hoard of such. There was a King promised his beauteous Queen A virgin necklace of pure matchless pearls Which ne'er before had worn or threaded been, Milk-white from where the Arab fisher furls His sails of mat; and stoops and plunges in, And sees the light fade farther from his eyes, And hears the dreadful, weltering, waters' din; Yet dares the agony, and grasps the prize;‚Äî Sinking a slave, with hardly means to feed; Returning, gift-giver to Queens and Kings,‚Äî The brine choking his lips, the bladdered weed Tangling his feet, but those pale precious things Safe in his loin cloth! And, perchance, one day He watched the high Sultana pass in state; The necklace warm between her breasts, her way Lined by a worshipping crowd, her sceptred mate Proud of that pearl√´d Consort. And his heart Would laugh within him saying, ‚ÄúLord of lands! In what thou lovest I, too, claim a part! She is so fair because these toilsome hands Tore from the waves their wealth. Yea, Pearl of pearls Lulu-'l-makn√ªn! than Houris lovelier, That hast the black eyes of the Prophet's Girls Promised in Paradise, and mouth of myrrh: In next life after this whose wilt thou be, His that gave gold for thee, or mine, who went Across the shark's jaws to the nether sea, Nigh dead for breath, that thou might'st pace content?‚Äù So, Queen of mine! I am that Eastern King! These pearls were never strung which I send thee; I ransacked unknown gulfs for them, I bring New moonlight wonders from an unsailed sea. Nay, and my Pearl! I am that Arab Diver! I stooped and plunged for you into the wave, Returning rich‚Äîyet richer, when forever, The treasure of the upper air I have; If not!‚ÄîAh, life's light quenched, and life's faith broken! How fares it with pearl-fisher dead and foiled? Lost!‚Äîtossing on the billows for a token Of his large hope, he drifts where he had toiled; And sea-birds‚Äîwhich are like sharp thoughts‚Äîconsume him; And hideous fish‚Äîfierce as love-longings‚Äîtear The heart that beat so bold; and storm-clouds gloom him Out from the sight of Heaven. Pity him, Dear! Y. [Y√¢cut Asf√ªr: so the swart Sonar names] Y√¢cut Asf√ªr: so the swart Sonar names These golden-lighted topazes from Ind: If you should heed his tale, their yellow flames Gleam in the dark so that a man may find A path thereby; or read in Holy Writ; Or see her lips whose neck lies on his arm; Also the topez (levigating it) Cures sleeplessness, scant breath, and fever's harm; Soothes anger; strengthens wit; counterchecks spells; Aids divination, and‚Äîon cups inlaid‚Äî If poison lurk within, faithfully tells, Becoming pale! Albertus Magnus said It was Draconium‚Äîa Dragon's bone‚Äî (Black and pyramidal) which rendered sight To Theodosius. Nay, indeed, the stone Was Topaz! Shall I give you this aright? 'Twas in those times when birds and beasts could talk, Who now are wiser than to know too much; When newer eyes saw Shades and Angels walk; And younger hands feared not God's hand to touch; The ‚ÄòGesta Romanorum‚Äô tells it:‚Äîhe, The blind great C√¶sar, hung a brazen gong Before his Palace-gate, whither flocked free All citizens, and whoso suffered wrong Might beat the brass and speak‚Äîlofty or low‚Äî Into that Emperor's ear, patient reclining; The purple wrapped around his sightless brow, But in his soul the Light of Justice shining. Thus, one day came a snake which had her young Under the gateway-tower: she, sharply hissing, Struck with her coils the echoing gong that hung Against the porch. Thereon, C√¶sar‚Äîdismissing The dark-eyed girls who fanned him‚Äîcried in Greek ‚ÄúHave entrance, friend!‚Äù And, gliding in, the Snake Did homage with her crest in dust; then, meek Addressed the Master of the East: ‚ÄúI make ‚ÄúMy nest beneath thy wall, where, yesternight, Safe slept my brood‚Äîto me more fair and brave Than those rich ropes of sards and jacinths bright Binding thy head-cloth: but, while I, thy slave, ‚ÄúWandered for food, there stole a porcupine Into my hole, and ate my snakelets three; And hath my wonted house, as 'twere not mine! And will not yield! Now, therefore, unto me Grant justice, C√¶sar!‚Äù Then, the sightless King Gave straight command they kill that beast, and lead The Serpent safely homeward. And this thing Was wrought; and men lightly forgot the deed. But, on the morrow, at the hour of noon‚Äî When Theodosius on his day-bed slept‚Äî Jewelled with many a jet and amber moon, And ringed and gilt, a monstrous serpent crept Over the patterned pavements, clomb the bed; And, gliding to the cheek of C√¶sar, laid From its wide jaws,‚Äîthick-set with fangs and red,‚Äî A Topaz upon either lid! Affrayed The Guards beheld, and would have slain the Worm Save that it uttered: ‚ÄúLet me pass with life! Rouse ye your Lord! then will all men affirm I pay full court-fees for my righted wife.‚Äù And lo! when Theodosius waked, his eyes Were purged of cloud! the blessed beam of Day Shone once more, his to joy in; and surprise Fell on the city. But Love wins alway! Two marvels hath the Topaz! When 'tis laid‚Äî The light wine-coloured jewel‚Äîin the sun, Day by day you shall mark its glories fade; Golden and crimson lustres, one by one, Perishing into paleness! Lesson-laden The gem's deed is, for see you not a token? Was never tender secret of fair maiden But lost its deep delight in being spoken. Again, take amber-yellow Topazes! Heat them‚Äîsafe-packed in crucible‚Äîand lay All glowing on white stone; and then, as is The dying dolphin's change, or shift of Day Melting to Night, so show the strange adornings Of this gem cooling: first, like ice it gleams Hueless, then steals a tender tint of morning's Soft earliest saffron; afterwards it beams Such faint pale pink as white hedge-roses blush with; And last‚Äîall suddenly‚Äîa rosy glow Shoots through the stone, as rich as rubies flush with; Remaining fixed! Who made the Sun doth know Why this should be! Yet, clasp these jewels, too, Near to your heart! My next slave flies to bear Stuff for that structure which I promised you, A Fairy Palace, richer than Kings rear. M. [Moonstone, and Malachite and Almondine!] Moonstone, and Malachite and Almondine! These for the Pleasure-Place I build with song, Since you did say: ‚ÄúNow, lodge me like a Queen! Feign me a Bower of Fancy! Love is strong!‚Äù Here, then, I dream a dream to house you in, A Palace for my Princess, saying that: The spot shall be where the great hills begin, Rolling in dark waves from the Deccan flat. This way on Maharashtra's plains they look; That way to mountains and the Arab sea; A forest, full of many a tangled nook, Clothes the grey crags with green embroidery. Fair is the scene, and sweet the seasons all; The folk Mahrattas; pastoral, simple, brave. Thither my fairy architects I call, And there a lovely Indian home I'd have! Like to abodes of the East, the stateliest planned, With white wide walls, high domes, gates gold and red; Pillared chabootras, dark with shade, shall stand Round the first court, where steps of marble spread Before a pierced-work porch, whereby you pass To inner coolness, through a columned cloister, Whose roof‚Äîrose-crystal‚Äîpolished thin as glass, Lights the veined pavements, all of alabaster. Scented strange woods shall frame the chamber-doors, Fountains of fragrant waters will be there; Along the ways, and winding stairs, and floors Delicious things of Art shall make it fair! Blossoms of unnamed hues and odours fine Shall deck the courts for you‚Äîthe Flower of All! Birds in the orange-walks and lanes of vine Shall know your name, and come when you do call! Flowers, too, shall glow of never-fading bloom. On screens of Jasper wrought, fencing the Bower, Such as one sees in that white Temple-Tomb, Reared by great Shah Jehan on Jumna's shore, To keep for ever famous Mumtaz' name‚Äî The Lady of his Throne‚Äîa hundred gems, Cut to their burning hearts one flower to frame; Then inlaid on the slabs, in anadems, And wreaths, and arabesques of rare conceit, A changeless garden, where the happy eye Lights nowhere, but some posy, costly-sweet, Fills it with joy of daintiest jewellery. I will have columns such as Solomon Commanded of his Djins‚Äînaming The Name Cut in the blue of that dread signet stone, His magic Sapphire; columns such as came Across the Aram≈ìan sands, across The Erythr≈ìan billows; syenite, Black porphyry purple-veined, the satin gloss Of onyx; coral, crystals, chrysolite, With abaci of silver. I will have A milk-white warm pavilion in the midst, Such as Siddartha, Prince of India, gave To bright Yas√¥dhara. Whisper thou didst That ‚ÄúLove is rich;‚Äù and what, then, shall prevent Our Palace with such Amethyst lamps to light As gleamed o'er Cleopatra's sleep, and sent Rays of soft splendour through th' Egyptian night; Dimming Miz√¢r and Algol? What forbids To ordain such hangings as Aladdin chose Of blue and amber silks; and coverlids Stiff with sewn gold and seed pearls? Ay, or those Carpets of Iran woven thick with tints Of peach and tulip; and sweet secret times Of Leila and Majn√ªn; and pictured hints Of lovers' bliss; and tender subtle rhymes From Persian verse‚Äîsegg√¢dehs gay, where fall The henna-pstained small feet of Shiraz girls Softly as snow on roses. Therewithal A pleasaunce shall extend, where a stream purls Cold from the crags, the sunny lawns along, Sparkling from stone to stone; bordered by ranks Of blue and crimson lotus, and a throng Of plumed palms shading all the dappled banks With shifting fans; and underneath the palms, Moon-flowers, musk-roses, and the silvery spear Of aloes, and the champak's star of balms, With milky mogras, breathing far and near Breath as from Paradise; Oh, and the walks (New-watered every dawn) cut low and high With runnels, where the mountain-water talks Music to doves and mynas, nesting nigh; Ofttimes o'erleaped by golden-coated hordes Of antelope, the bucks leading the way; The limpid-eyed light does following their lords, Their shyness gone; friendly, and safe, and gay: For in our Palace peace and love shall reign, And all fair creatures of the air and earth Be friends of man, who, elsewhere, pays his pain With pain and harm to these; though Death and Birth Are one for all, and Life the self-same sadness, Where Love and Pity rule not! There shall be For gentle service faces full of gladness; Willing swift feet, and happy vassalry; For good it is to obey where Love is master, And freest he who serves the noblest Queen; Therefore, thou minister! bring‚Äîfast and faster‚Äî Moonstone, and Malachite, and Almondine! A. [Aquamarine‚Äîfrom Fancy's treasure-hall!] Aquamarine‚Äîfrom Fancy's treasure-hall! Yet sad to-day for me this sea-green stone; For on the Channel-sands your light feet fall, And I, among these millions, walk alone. But, wave-stained jewel! shine with brighter thought! It was across the Deep‚Äîyears back‚Äîshe came; The billows, which are of thy colour, brought That gentle face to us. For this I name The Beryl, water-tinted, as one stone To spell you. On its lucent face is writ ?????? ?????? ?????‚Äî‚Äúall alone, Far hence, among the wine-dark waves, they sit.‚Äù The ‚Äúhappy Isles,‚Äù he means, who carved that line; For ancient sailors told a mystic story How some had seen, had touched‚Äîin joy divine‚Äî Makar√¥n n√™sous, at the ‚ÄúGroups of Glory,‚Äù The sweet ‚ÄúSea-Paradise‚Äù‚Äîso hints this Greek! Ah, if wave-coloured gem could guide us there; And we, far voyaging, might sight some peak Unknown, unnamed‚Äîcleaving the tranquil air With pinnacles which feel no storm, and steeps Lawny and lovely, where Death does not come, Nor change, nor hate, nor care; but alway sleeps The purple main around the perfect home! Where we should find delightful friends and lovers, And hear no word of woe on any lip; Opening glad eyes, as when the Dawn discovers A sky of blue and gold, and ill dreams slip Back to that gloom which bred them: where the wonder Of ‚Äúwhence‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhither‚Äù would be known; And we should lie, like Gods, above the thunder, The Past perceived, the Future sure and shewn; Such were great magic! But the Isles in mind Rise farther than the farthest ocean, Dear! Thither to sail‚Äîwith e'er so fair a wind‚Äî Asks more than toil of many a wandering year! We shall not reach them, save with Earth for vessel, Sky for our sea, and for long voyage Life; But if Love steers, at last our sails may nestle, Furled in those far-off Isles‚Äîpast storm and strife. R. [Rubies, with Pearls! That's Nature's jewellery!] Rubies, with Pearls! That's Nature's jewellery! Look in your mirror when you speak my name, And while you say it you may plainly see Those charming reasons why I write the same; Pearl-rows which gleam through rose-leaf lips of grace‚Äî Ah, no!‚ÄîI will not weave such worn-out posies; I had a higher fancy for this place Than rhymes which jingle ‚Äúrubies, pearls, and roses.‚Äù For these are M√¢nikas‚Äîstones true and good, Which my spell brings from Burmah's steaming grove. Such have the colour of the drop of blood Shed on the white neck of a wounded dove. Of such was carved the magic vial filled With water from the ‚ÄúFount of Youth‚Äù that wells Behind the ‚ÄúSea of Darkness;‚Äù water spilled By Sultan Suleiman. Ben Ali tells This legend, done in Persian, from the Book ‚ÄúLights of Canopus‚Äù‚Äîhow the Hebrew Khan Sate on the cloud-roofed mountain-tops which look This way on Ind, that way to Khorasan. Angels and Djins and Peris round the king Paid homage, mixed with man and beast and bird, For on his finger was the Sapphire-ring Graved with the name of God, which whoso heard, Hearing, obeyed. Wherefore the Eagles flew Against the sun, to shade him; she-bears brought Wild honey; snakes their jewels; flowers upgrew To make a footstool for his feet. Outraught Over the Earth his sceptre none withstood In lands, or seas, or nether-worlds, or sky Where‚Äîlike to glassy fish in glassy flood, Blue in blue hyaline‚Äîthe Spirits lie Unviewed, but living: and, this thing was seen; There drifted from the Pass a darksome cloud Which, gliding nigh‚Äîthe mountain-crests between,‚Äî Took vast and filmy form, at first a shroud That seemed to wrap some phantom-head; but, soon A shape of grace whose light and colour gleamed From gold of setting sun, pearl of new moon, With wings of waving sapphire, hair which streamed Curled jacinth on the breeze; garments of amber Draped vaguely from an azure girdle-band; Great breasts of rounded rose, veils that enchamber A half-spied awful countenance; a hand Slow-issuing from the shade, holding a cup Cut from the sunset's ruby,‚Äîlight compressed To solid splendour‚Äî‚ÄúDrink this liquor up!‚Äù A voice cried:‚Äúdrink, dread King! The high behest Of Him Whose Name is on thy Signet-Stone Wills I bring water from the Well of Life; Of all men, Suleiman! to thee alone God proffers this! a draught with power so rife That, quaffing it, thy flesh and blood shall take Even as an Angel's, comely, changeless youth; Days without end, delights of sense to make Immortal years seem few; insight of Truth Such as thy Soul hath craved for. Drink or spill! Have here this Vessel with its dancing draught; My errand is performed! Judge how ye will, Suleiman and the Counsellors!‚Äù A waft Of sighing wind scattered the waning shape; In the King's grasp the Ruby Vial shone; Far down the Pass‚Äîfrom splintered cape to cape‚Äî Faded the breaking cloud-flecks, one by one. But, when the strange Voice ceased, Suleiman mused:‚Äî ‚ÄúYea! good it were to drink this gift of God; Good to repair my days and nights misused, Treading with wiser steps life's ways retrod: Good to win back the fiery speed of youth In veins which slacken; good to ever guard My kingdom; to strip bare beautiful Truth With eyes undimmed, heart's hot desire unmarred, Wholly possessing her, naked and pure; Myself ever renewed, joyous, and strong; Good, too, it were to have my years endure, That God's fair Temple,‚Äîwhich I fashion long‚Äî May grow to perfect glory; and my wars Close in sure peace,‚ÄîI seeing, age by age, My people prosper under wider stars, In larger lands; till, on the great last page Of this World's Book Suleiman's name shall shine! Yea! I will drink! Yet, ye who gather near, Djins! Angels! Beasts and Fowls, Servants of mine! How counsel ye your King? Fain would I hear.‚Äù With loud acclaim, ‚ÄúDrink, happy King!‚Äù said they; And one with dark plumes folded, evil-eyed, Sakhrah the Dev‚Äîwho, later, stole away Suleiman's signet-ring‚Äîlow bending, cried: ‚ÄúDrink, Lord of Lords! the gold of youth is bright, And dull the silver of slow-creeping eld; And dear are wealth and power; and soft the night By dawn of lovely ladies' eyes dispelled!‚Äù And Sh√Ær the Djin spake:‚Äîknowing magic best‚Äî ‚ÄúDrink, Friend of God! the Earth's weal rests on thee As sleeps an infant on a nursing breast; It were not well thy Throne should vacant be!‚Äù And Amber√Æn the Peri, gliding close With flutter of white plumes, said, ‚ÄúDrink, my King! The joys of men and Devs in thee repose As gems are held in cirque of golden ring!‚Äù Assad the Lion answered for the beasts, Laying his shagged mane at the Monarch's feet, ‚ÄúDrink, Master of all forests! Thy brave feasts Have known no wine like this, subtle and sweet!‚Äù And Sag, the Seal, moist from the Indian main, Drooped his black fins, and bellowed: ‚ÄúSovereign, drink! The Water-creatures and the Fish are fain That thou shouldst live for ever!‚Äù From the brink Of Baikal flew the Locust, chirping: ‚ÄúKhan! Drink! for all things which burrow, creep, and buzz, Trust thee to help them, helping beast and man: And Who doth raise the dead from one bone, Luz, ‚ÄúGives thee at one draught Angelhood!‚Äù Spake last Hud-hud, the Lapwing, piping: ‚ÄúI have seen The glory of Queen Balkis now o'erpassed; Drink, Lord! for never such a gift hath been!‚Äù But glancing sternly round, quoth Suleiman: ‚ÄúAre all things here? Hath none some other rede? Lo! ere I drink, and pass to God from Man, Is every counsel uttered?‚Äù ‚ÄúHast thou need, ‚ÄúGreat King!‚Äù the hill-fox barked, ‚Äúto hear what word K√ªmri will speak? She tarrieth on her nest! I spied her in the thorns!‚Äù ‚ÄúSend forth a bird To summon her!‚Äù quoth he. At such behest Came K√ªmri, flying from her tree; the Dove Who hath the neck of purple, and the wings Of silver, and the breast filled full of love: Heaven's softest creature. Spake she: ‚ÄúKing of Kings, ‚ÄúPardon thy handmaid that she stayed to brood Twin eggs which must not chill! Thy dread command Passed unto me, and I have left my wood! What dost thou with the red cup in thy hand?‚Äù ‚ÄúI hold from Heaven a draught of life immortal, The M√¢-ul-Haiyat!‚Äù Suleiman replied: ‚ÄúIf I shall quaff, Death's dark and hateful portal Never can gape for me!‚Äù Then, K√ªmri sighed: ‚ÄúAh, mighty Lord! how should a little bird, Which only knows to nest and brood and coo, Counsel great Suleiman? Yet be this heard; Hath He, Who gave the water, given, too, ‚ÄúThe boon that whosoever holds thy heart,‚Äî Queen, lover, friend, concubine, daughter, son‚Äî May in the magic potion take their part? For then this guerdon were a precious one!‚Äù ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù the King said, ‚Äúto me alone the cup! Not larger, see! than those eggs thou didst leave! I am commanded‚Äîif I will‚Äîto sup Its last bright drop!‚Äù Then, moaned the Dove: ‚ÄúI grieve ‚ÄúThey counsel thee to drink; for all will go, Thy Queens, thy children, ministers, and slaves; Thy best belov'd will be as last year's snow On these hot mountains! Thou wilt rule mid graves, ‚ÄúDead‚Äîthou though livest‚Äîwith thy dead; and see Lip after lip, pressed once to thy lip, press The bitter brim of Fate's black cup; and be Sad in thy splendour, with such loneliness ‚ÄúAs deserts know not, nor the lifeless main: Thy Earth around thee will grow old and grey; Thy Kingdoms pass; thy fields fall wild again, But thou‚Äîtoo favoured‚Äîshalt be young alway ‚ÄúWith memory only old; yet, that will taste Death in the dust which blows from every tomb; Death in the flowers which wave in every waste, Death in the mid-day light, death in the gloom! ‚ÄúLord of all Kings! forgive! Love bids me speak! If her mate cometh not the wild dove dies! I would not drink hereof, who am so weak, Lest I might lose by gaining: Love is wise!‚Äù Thereon departed K√ªmri‚Äîflying hard To find her nest ere the twin eggs should chill: And Suleiman the King, upon the sward With eager hand the magic draught did spill.

Garnet from the Hills of Flame A stone thus known hides in dark Hentha's glade Which, when the Indians find, with joy they name, And‚Äîproving‚Äîtoil no more; their gain is made: The ‚ÄúNoble Garnet!‚Äù There the colour lives So fine and rich no wheel can cut it dim: Flake it, or break it, every splinter gives One glorious crimson glow from core to rim; The colour of the blood of a man's heart When‚Äîbetween red and purple‚Äîit doth sweep Through the chief vein of all; nay, or a part Of the heart's self, carved where the life lies deep So if you say ‚Äúsuch praise is common speech!‚Äù And ‚ÄúI have heard these tender things before!‚Äù Ah, Sweetheart! let my Indian Garnets teach A better word to you, a wiser lore; For these are cut, Dear! from a heart of faith; The colour of Love's blood within them glows. Know you a mystical Pur√¢na saith There lurks in Balkh, under the lower snows, A gem so hued, like purple wine congealed, Styled Chintasiddhi (that's ‚ÄúDesire fulfilled‚Äù), And, whoso lighteth on it, goes afield Where two streams meet; and‚Äîwater being spilled From forth his palm to all six quarters‚Äîthen He whispers ‚ÄúOM‚Äù‚Äîthe stone laid on his tongue, And therewith, from the forest or the glen, A red she-wolf advances, great with young, Who speaks a word; and, if the man hath learned The counter-word, that wolf will whine and moan; And‚Äîsudden‚Äîto a red-haired woman turned Cry out: ‚ÄúI am the Servant of the Stone!‚Äù ‚ÄúCommand me as thou wilt!‚Äù Then, if he wills A feast be spread for him on plates of gold; A palace builded in the hidden hills, With courts and gardens wondrous to behold; Or, if he will a magic horse with wings To bear him through the Blue; or mail of proof No steel can pierce; or if his fancyings Lean towards lovely wives, or wealth, or woof Of Kashmir silks with warp of silver thread, Or pearls, or poisons‚Äîshe with blood-bright locks Fetcheth them all! You shake a dubious head? You think the heathenish Pur√¢na mocks? Oh, but the Talmud hath a passage, Dear!‚Äî The grave, great Talmud‚Äîtelling how one flouted Rabbi ben Zachai, at the hour of prayer, Who said, while that rash unbeliever doubted, Jahveh would build gates for Jerusalem Of pearls and garnets, measuring every way Full thirty cubits‚Äîevery stone of them‚Äî And cut them to ten cubits; and so lay Thresholds and lintels. Yet, that scorner laughed! But, next moon, sailing on the Joppa sea, A white wave cast him over, and he quaffed Salt drink of Death, down-sinking horribly; And touched the oozy bed; and saw‚Äîaffrayed,‚Äî Sea-angels there, who rolled great pearls and stones Full thirty cubits broad and long; and made Blocks of their mighty beauty. So his bones Quaked at the sight, for all their angry eyes Burned on him; and he spake: ‚ÄúOh, Angels! say Why cleave ye these?‚Äù They answered, in stern wise, ‚ÄúWe cleave these pearls and carbuncles to lay The portals of the Holy City!‚Äù Judge If he came back in better mind‚Äîwhat time They washed his mouth clean of the weeds and sludge, And heard his trembling tale!

For, though I bring thee hither but in fiction ‚ÄúEphod of blue and gold,‚Äù with mystic gem, Let my verse pass, but be its benediction Lasting, and crown thee like a diadem! Since prayer fulfils itself which rises rightly From lips by gentle love made true and sweet; So, let these belted Agates glitter brightly; As when Haro√ºn cast beneath his feet Coats of the camp, and donned white robe and mitre; And round his waist the ‚Äúcurious girdle‚Äù tied; And drew the thongs and gilded ouches tighter, Hanging his breast-plate high‚ÄîOh, beautified By wondrous work of ‚Äúgold and blue and crimson, On fine-twined cloth‚Äù‚Äîthe gold beat out four-square A span each way; and gold chains linked the rims on, With fourfold ranks of jewellery set fair,‚Äî First Sardius, Topaz, and the Jaspis green; Next Smaragd, Sapphire, and an Adamant; Third, Ligure, Agate, Amethyst were seen Laid on chased beddings; and the fourth line burnt With Beryl, Onyx, Chrysolite: each stone Carved with a Tribal name!

There God with him Talked; and none other heard the dread words said. But, if the days were evil‚Äîif the camp Had sinned‚Äîthe Agate changed its white to black; Waned the green Smaragd like a dying lamp; The Sapphire half its heavenly blue did lack!

This Amber, clear and golden,‚Äî Wept from great trees which, when the woods began, Waved boughs, it may be, over lovers olden, Shaded their slumbers, built primeval man His nuptial bowers: for, see! the bead encloses Winged things which fluttered in life's goodlihead; Here is embalmed memory of meadow-roses, An epitaph on unseen summers dead. So, too, for me, the Indian name of Amber Enshrines the pathos of a Buddhist page:‚Äî Ah, now! no story for a lady's chamber! Only the fable of some old-world Sage! Yet, you shall hear: she was Suvarna, ‚ÄúShining,‚Äù‚Äî The soft word pictures all the grace we praise In Beauty's inner beam, subtly combining Body and Soul, a perfumed lamp whose rays Gleam dim through alabaster. Legends note us Her ‚Äúeighteen perfect points,‚Äù the fragrant hair; The eyes clear-cut as petals of the lotus; The shapely nose, the little faultless pair Of ears carved shell-wise, and the close-set bosoms Rounded ‚Äúlike tortoise-shell;‚Äù the brown soft arms; Small hands, fine feet, mouth ‚Äúred as bimba-blossoms,‚Äù Gait of a pacing roe, form showing charms Like Sachi's, Queen of Heav'n. Lords did adore her, Ranas and Khans from many wondrous lands:‚Äî Kings came on elephants to kneel before her, Their kingdoms' jewels in their humbled hands. When she would dance it seemed like Music moving, Visible, living! When she sang, the Rose Forgot its nightingale! the Ko√Øl loving Stayed in his midway note to listen close! When one had seen Suvarna‚Äîsays my story‚Äî Fresh from the bath, in robes of gold and red, Her beauty glittering forth with youth's full glory, Glad, in her palace, on an ivory bed;‚Äî All women seemed her shadows! Still‚Äî'tis written‚Äî Lovers were many, but belov√´d none: Not once with Kama's arrow sank she smitten; This sun-light Lady wearied of the sun! Then she heard Buddha preach; and fierce upon her Fell passion for that holiness he taught: She would ‚ÄúBhiksh√ªni‚Äù live; no heart should own her! Freed should her soul be, and her footsteps brought Into the ‚ÄúNoble Path!‚Äù So went she lonely Climbing the hill-side to Lord Buddha's Cave; Hungering for Rest and Righteousness,‚Äîthose only‚Äî Thirsting for sweet melodious words which save. But, on the midmost steep, whose rugged ways Wounded the rose-red palms of her light feet, A streamlet brimmed a pool: Suvarna stays To sit and drink the water cool and sweet. Thus, bending in the shadow of the mountain To dip her hand and sip the crystal wave, Like a steel mirror the translucent fountain Back to her gaze her own bright image gave. There was the braided splendour of her tresses! There the deep wonder of her large dark eyes! There the brown neck and breast, made for caresses, The flower-soft mouth, the shadowed charm which lies In curve of nape, and sweep of silken shoulder; The supple tapering waist, the swelling round Of hip and shapely limb:‚Äîher own beholder Suvarna marvelled at the form she found. ‚ÄúWas I so fair?‚Äù she sighed:‚ÄúWell might they love me, Rajas and Sirdars! And what days we had, Good, glorious days! before the ache did move me To hear this Rishi. Am I sane or mad To mount his hill? The Gods have given me beauty As to the Ketuk-flower they gave perfume; And gold bands to their bees! Is it not duty The bee should suck the honey of the bloom?‚Äù Therewith her tears welled, falling‚Äîpearl by pearl‚Äî Into the pool, which broke its glass with ripples; Vanished the image! Then the Indian Girl Tied the silk choli-strings beneath her nipples; And drew her sari round; and, rising, turned, Taking the downward path, and softly saying: ‚ÄúNay!‚Äîfor such grace and youth must not be spurned! I was not made for penance and for praying: ‚ÄúSome last, best, lover waits me!‚Äù So, she runs Laughing, adown the slope‚Äîdistantly hearing Gay murmurings of the town, and pleasant tones Of pipe and lute; and feet of hamals bearing Brides to their bridegrooms, ‚ÄúThey who will may tread The Noble Road,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúbe mine the valley Where pleasure lives!‚Äù But Buddha overhead‚Äî Calm in his cave‚Äîbeheld Suvarna's folly; And pitied her; and, pitying, sought to save: So (saith the tale) by magic utterance stripping His own form off, assumed the aspect, brave And winsome, of a Nautch-Girl, featly tripping Along the Damsel's path; more heavenly fair, Comelier and brighter than Suvarna's brightness; With tender wistful gaze, and gracious air, Soft happy smile, and steps of dancing lightness. Amazed, enchanted, ‚ÄúAh, thou loveliest One!‚Äù Suvarna cries:‚ÄúOh, not of Earth, but Heaven! What is thy name? what errand goest thou on? Beautiful, perfect, Sister! art thou given ‚ÄúTo comfort and confirm me? Come with me!‚Äù Answered the stranger,‚Äîsoft as running water, Or wood-doves cooing‚Äî‚ÄúSweet such company! I am content!‚Äù And so Suvarna brought her With tender hand in tender hand enlacing, And hearts close-beating, and commingling eyes, Far down the hill. As that bright pair went pacing, Melted with gentle love Suvarna sighs: ‚ÄúShiva! how fair thou art! th' Asoka's honey Draws not the sunbird as thou drawest me! More than to list the wisdom of the Muni It were to rest thy head upon my knee, ‚ÄúAnd weave thy waist a girdle with mine arms, And press a thousand times thy mouth of wonder: Dear! let us sit‚Äîthe sun grows hot! thy charms Ask shade, like palm-buds in the month of thunder!‚Äù So sate they down; and, locked in close embraces Fed on each other's fairness‚Äîlove for love‚Äî Hands joined, arms twined, locks intermixed, soft faces Nestled together like a dove with dove: Till, fondling her to rest, her silk lids kissing, Toying with taper hands, and smooth dark skin, Suvarna's self sank into sleep, yet pressing That beauteous maid her circling arms within. All the fierce noon and afternoon they slumber; At eve the Indian girl, starting, awoke: I said this was no tale for lady's chamber! Ah, can you bear to hear what terror broke On sad Suvarna's gaze? Clasped to her heart A festering corpse tainted the air; its bones Ridged the shrunk flesh; the putrid inward part Blotched it with green and purple; cold as stones Glared its glazed orbs; all the fair grace was fled Like gold fruit mouldered, or a lily's crown Withering to foulness! Oh, that awful Dead!‚Äî Suvarna flung her horrid playmate down, And shrieked, veiling her eyes; and ran a space, Wringing her palms. Then, nigh at hand, she saw Lord Buddha looking on her tearful face With countenance of majesty and awe. ‚ÄúDaughter!‚Äù spake he, ‚Äúfor this thing thou hast left The path which should have led thee unto bliss! Lo! as the flower fades and the fruit is reft, Love ends in parting, Beauty fails to this! ‚ÄúAs she was, so shalt thou be, and thy kind! Nay, if it chagrined thee to kiss a skull, Be done with Love! always‚Äîred lips behind‚Äî Grin those white jaws for flames of funeral! ‚ÄúAnd worse things be than funeral pyres, or parting; The Spirit, sick with passion and sweet pain, Flits back from Death to Life for direr starting On Earth's wild wheel, and builds its house again: ‚ÄúSince, what thou art, thou makest! Trishna breeds it! Thine is the prison, and the gaoler thou! The snake which poisons man his own heart feeds it; Yet‚Äîif thou wilt‚Äîwake from this madness now, ‚ÄúVanquish thy longings! Come! there is no sorrow Like Pleasure; no delight like passions slain! But if thou lust for life the stern To-morrow Will find thee lost in thy self-chosen gain, ‚ÄúAs the grey crane dies by the dried-up lake Where she laid foolish eggs. Meditate Truth! Enter the Noble Way! Wise barter make For blest Nirv√¢na with thy grace and youth!‚Äù Then did Suvarna, with impatient hand, Tear from her neck the amber beads and gold; Shook down her tresses from their jewelled band, And cut, and cast them from her; wild and bold; And meekly followed Buddh. Was that done well? Ah, Love! love is so lovely, who can say? I only know this life! if Love be Hell Then Hate is Heaven! Let us not go her way! D. [Diamonds! Now‚Äîwomanlike‚Äîyour eyes grow brighter] Diamonds! Now‚Äîwomanlike‚Äîyour eyes grow brighter Flashing the sparkle back of such fair things; Hold both hands up! I sent a demon-fighter To wrest these wonders from barbaric kings: M√¢sh, alm√¢sh, h√Æra, h√™tih! white, and blue, The flaming golden sort, the black, and pink! Here be brave carcanets and cirques for you A-blaze with beams, cut sunlike! Did you think Poets were poor? Nay! if our fancy choose To delve old Earth, down to her deepest treasures, Or spoil black-bearded Sultans, see! the Muse Denies her children no such airy pleasures. And wise men wot Golconda's brilliant gem, Tried in the fire, turns black, mere common fuel. But these, my fairy stones, outvalue them, Time-proof and flame-proof! Here's a beauteous jewel My minion brings‚Äîthe ‚ÄúSyamantakan;‚Äù Satr√¢jita the King worshipped the Sun At dawning when his rosy course began, At evening when his golden road was run; Reciting holy Gayatr√Æ, and given To all high deeds, a pious Prince and tried; Wherefore one morn‚Äî'tis said‚Äîthat Lord of Heaven, The Regent of the Sun, stood by his side; Unclasped a crest-gem from his crown, and bound it On Prince Satr√¢jita, bending in prayer, The folk of Dw√¢raka, much-wondering, found it At the King's throat, burning the dazzled air With beams of glory: and the influence shed From that enchanted stone caused rain to fall; Averted serpents, pests; quickened the dead; Brought victories to the Realm, fortune to all If good men wore it; but an evil one Died of its lustre. Oh, you laugh! yet listen: Pras√™na, the King's brother, put it on And rode a-hunting with that gem a-glisten Over his head-cloth; and a Lion slew Horseman and horse; but J√¢mbab√¢n the Bear Killed the strong beast, and took the spoil, and threw The sun-gem to his youngest cub to wear: For Krishna tracked their foot-prints; pierced the wood; Came to the cavern black, heard the Bear mother Say:‚ÄúSleep, my Babe! now will our days be good; This is the Sun's great Diamond, and none other!‚Äù She, seeing Krishna,‚ÄúAhi! ahi!‚Äù roared: Then J√¢mbab√¢n rushed forth, and waged fierce fight; But lost the Sun-stone to its doughty Lord; Who died a-bed, slain for that jewel bright. A wild, rude, Sanskrit story! Yes; but wrought With touches of old wisdom 'broidered in it! Flash ‚ÄòSyamantakan‚Äô in light of thought And note this gleam:‚Äîwhite knowledge, if we win it, Is granted from One Source‚Äîfor joy or dolour‚Äî To whomso hath it, Prince, or Man, or Beast, Yet, as each crystal by its inner colour Stains the pure beam enkindled from the East, So shall the nature of each soul, endoubled By will on mind, dye fair or dark that ray. Oh, you may wear this Diamond, Dear! untroubled; Look! on your neck it glitters clear as Day! E. [Emeralds! The colour, Fanny! of the light] Emeralds! The colour, Fanny! of the light Sifted through lime-leaves on a summer-noon; Or curl of crested wave, when foam-bells bright Fringe the green furrows of the sea in June. Such should true emeralds be! green‚Äîit is said‚Äî As throat of parroquet; or spark quick-twinkled From fire-fly's lamp; or fresh unfolded blade Of water-grass; or lotus-leaf unwrinkled New risen 'mid the pool, or glow which fringes The gleaming amethysts in the peacock's train: Sourindro Mohun holds ‚Äúall Virtue hinges On tints like these, and, if there show a stain Yellowish or clouded, do not seek to heal Snake-bites with such, nor carve a love-name on them!‚Äù But mine are ‚ÄòMarakats‚Äô whose hearts reveal Greener and greener glories as you con them; A necklace for a queen! Not that you need it! One gem-mark was already on your neck Set by the Power who made us‚Äîas I read it‚Äî Your throat with one soft little foil to speck For contrast's sake: as lovely dames, who brightened With high-bred charms King Louis' court or Anne's, Laid on their damask cheeks patches which heightened The tender pink, just spied above their fans. Yet, be you heedful of this lucent jewel, Soft as the moon-ray seen through leaf-green waves By those sea-maids whose love, earnest but cruel, Draws down the sailor, dead, to their cold caves: For wise men write that, like as diamonds hidden Under the pillow of a sleeping bride, Will make her closed lips open, all-unbidden, To tell if ever any lips beside Touched their ripe crimson, so the Emerald's hue‚Äî By reason that this is the stone of Faith‚Äî Reports when plighted lovers prove untrue, Ever so widely parted! Mansoor saith: It burgeons for true love, like sprays of henna; But withers, at a broken vow to white, Or falls in tintless fragments. Avicenna Bade breathe upon it, at the morning light, And, if the One belov'd were false, a mist Would pass athwart its verdant lustre, telling Of oaths forsworn! When frail Zuleika kissed Yusuf,‚Äîher Lord, in Pharaoh's palace dwelling, Knew by his signet. Doubt you that was so? Yet think how stones are built in Earth's abysses! What wonderful dark secrets Gnomes must know! How they may hear men's whispers, sighs, and kisses, Living in gems‚Äîas Celsus held they live!‚Äî When George the Third was throned, an emerald fell Out from his crown; and, did the Fates forgive? America was lost! you know it well! But still you smile‚ÄîAmerican by birth‚Äî Thinking that loss a gain! Well, I'll be grave! Esteem the emerald noblest stone of Earth When you shall hear the Queen of Sheba gave An emerald vast to Suleiman the King, Cut from the mother-crystal‚Äîflawless, shining‚Äî By life-long labour. Oh, a perfect thing, Leek-green, playing to blue and gold! Reclining Within his summer-tent Suleiman bade Amru his steward bear it to the Palace: At the first step which bearded Amru made Down sank he dead! The precious carven chalice Had fall'n, in ruined beauty; but, a wretch‚Äî White with the third degree of leprosy‚Äî Begging against the gate, his arm did stretch, And caught the glowing cup,‚Äîand saved! And, see! Clean grew his flesh, again, as babe's new-born! Then the King gave command Balkis the Queen, Be brought to audience on the morrow's morn; And, awful-eyed, he told what deeds had been: How this was dead, that healed. But she replied, Low-laughing; ‚ÄúKing! It was not cut to give Into the hands of liars! Amru died Touching the Gem of Truth; thy slave will live Henceforward whole, because whole was his mind! The mother-stone of this had virtues vast; Only true lips must touch it! False will find Thy Hermon honey slay therein! 'Twill cast All ills from such as keep a sinless heart!‚Äù Then quoth King Suleiman, ‚ÄúWhich man is he, Save my poor Syrian who did bear the smart Of God's hard hand‚Äîyet love Him? Let him be My Steward! Let the dreadful Cup be laid Within the Temple of the Lord!‚Äù So fell it To keeping of the Priests. When C√¶sar made Jud√¶a a spoil, some Roman lord did sell it To one who kept that ‚Äúfurnished upper room‚Äù In whose sad walls the Master sate at meat With His disciples, 'ere the deed of doom, And the Last Supper's bread did meekly eat; And the Last Supper's wine meekly did pour, Saying:‚ÄúThese be my Body and my Blood! Do this in my remembrance!‚Äù At that hour The emerald cup of Sheba 'twas which stood At Christ's right hand; and in that cup did glisten The noblest wine which ever vine did shed; Soothing with peace the souls of all who listen, Feeding the spirits of the quick and dead. Then the Crusaders won it! Ninety fell Fighting round Godefroi for the beaker golden: That Cup which kissed the mouth of Christ‚Äîthey tell‚Äî Was wet with gore! A Paynim of the Soldan Lay, slain by twenty wounds, clutching the thing. The soldiers of the Cross freighted a ship‚Äî Proud Genoa's swiftest caravel‚Äîto bring The prize to Italy: and no man's lip Dared touch it, all those quiet centuries It lay in San Lorenzo. Next, it came To France,‚Äîor Spain, some tell: but he, who is Our Master, and the noblest English name Of living singers‚Äîholds (in Arthur's lay), Arimath≈ìan Joseph brought it here To Glastonbury, where the black-thorn spray Blossoms at Christmas, every mindful year; Nay, that one saw it! saw the glorious Grail! (Percival's Sister‚Äîpious, meek, a maid) Glide, with a sudden radiance, rosy, pale, Down a long silvery moon-path, through the shade: ‚ÄúRosy,‚Äù ‚Äúrose-red‚Äù‚Äîhe sings‚Äî‚Äúand, in it, beatings, As though alive,‚Äù and music, heavenly-tender Better than we can blow or touch, with meetings Of tones celestial; and a burning splendour Of Angels' feathers, fanning airs unfelt; And crimson samite draped; and stars which darted Hither and thither, leaving lines that melt In sparkles on the Blue; and dim shapes started Forth from the Void! Yet, only three,‚Äîor two‚Äî Believed with Arthur; he ‚Äúwho knew alway Himself no vision, and the high God knew No vision,‚Äù nor Lord Christ. But still I say The Cup was Emerald, glassy-green! I trow Where now it is, but dare not have it given; Could even Galahad dare? Could Arthur? No! Dear lips of Christ! Rich wine, vintaged in Heaven! L. [Ligure! the holy ‚ÄòLeshem,‚Äô now I bring] Ligure! the holy ‚ÄòLeshem,‚Äô now I bring, Jud√¶a's Gem, Jacynthus styled of old: Mark how the sunbeams flood with gold this thing, And how its dark heart stains th' imparted gold! Jacynth, the stone which has a sister-flower; The jewel wine-red, and the blossom, too: These both were snow-white once, until the hour When God Apollo Hyacinthus slew. Ever since then ??, ??is on the blossom And ??, ??writ upon the stone as well; And the life-blood from the Greek boy's hurt bosom Mars both with blackness,‚Äîso old legends tell. Ligures they wore, set in an iron torque At Rome, on midnights, laying L√©mur√´s When May's Ides came, for then the Ghosts did walk; Then were the Lemuralia. All the trees Drowsed in the Court; streets sleeping still‚Äîno sound! Save if an owl screeched, or a town-dog bayed Seeing the sheeted Shades pass o'er the ground Tip-toe, a-glide, with eyes which made afraid. But he would steal‚Äîthe House-master‚Äîbarefoot, Softly, not speaking any word for dread; Yet snapping oft his fingers, if some root Of vine or fig tripped him, like some one dead At devilish tricks. But, when‚Äîall mute‚Äîhe came Safe to the fountain, there he laved his face, And hands; and rubbed the Ligure, whispering name Of every restless Lar haunting the place. Next in his mouth he put the nine beans black, But must not glance behind, turning to go; While, one by one, he flung them o'er his back, Muttering ‚Äúhis fabis meam redimo Domum!‚Äù ‚ÄúWith these black beans I buy content.‚Äù Ite, paterni Manes! ‚ÄúGood Souls, quit!‚Äù Then, nine times beat a sheet of brass, and sent The Ghosts to Hades, where their fellows flit. Poor Ghosts! Love would not fear! Love dreads not death, Nor doom, nor darkness! See this Jacynth brought From Hedjaz! On its gold a verse which saith ‚ÄúWith thee was well, Belov√´d!‚Äù‚Äîand, inwrought The Cross of Christ with Islam's crescent moon!. . . A Christian maiden loved a Muslim youth, And he loved her; oh, heart and soul, Majn√ªn Loved Mariam the Nazarene. In sooth One look wrought all! Young Majn√ªn did repair Mosque-wards to pray; the loud-voiced Muazan Stood white against the blue; in either ear Pressing his thumb, and crying, ‚ÄúAsh'had-do-an La-illah'l-lul-la-ho!‚Äù ‚ÄúYe Faithful! know There is no God but God!‚Äù Hya ul-as-salaat ‚ÄúQuicken your steps to pray!‚Äù As-sal-la-to Khyrun min an-naum, ‚ÄúBetter, Believers! that Ye pray than sleep!‚Äù This cry was in his ears, The faith of Allah in his heart firm kept; When Mariam passed‚Äîand glanced: and lo! the years Found their crowned instant: Love, full-plumed, up leapt! Beautiful was she as upon its stalk The tulip newly nodding; heavenly-sweet The music of her voice; when she did walk The glad grass seemed to kiss her light fine feet! Face, from, as 'twere a Houri in the house; Eyes so divinely lustrous that their splendour Filled every heart with worship; and her brows Drawn like black bows over the eyelids tender, And shadowy lashes; and her teeth of pearl Between the rose-leaf lips; and rounded arms, And high white bosoms! Such a Christian Girl The Prophet had forgotten for her charms Amina and Khadidja! So they loved, Body and soul and blood blended to one In burning passion; and this passion proved Sorrow, as always. Majn√ªn was Said's son Sheykh of the Gate, a hot Believer: she Sole child of Nicolas the Merchant. Never Dared they to meet if night's complicity Veiled not their trembling joys. Cruel ones ever Watched them, incensed an Infidel's pale face Should draw an Islamite with Sorcery; Incensed a Maid of Christ should yield her place 'Mid saints, a Muslim's Light o' Love to be. But, through the jealous lattice of her bower Sometimes he took the comfort of her eyes And by the lute's low voice, or some dropped flower Knew it was well with her, or otherwise. For many waters shall not overflow, Nor sharpened daggers daunt, nor angry faces Affright, nor bitter doctrines check, nor woe Change a true love, which in the holy places Kneels nearest God. Yet, on our little star Purged must it be by Sorrow's fellowship; And pale the visages of lovers are With earthly griefs, when happy lip meets lip In those Elysian meads where Death is dead. So, on this parted pair, and on their city Fell evil times; the Plague, with footsteps red Strode through the Land, slaying‚Äîsans pause or pity‚Äî Wife, husband, youth and age. A strong man stood One moment whole,‚Äîthe next, there crept a thrill, Like the cold breath of Azrael, through his blood; His eyes dimmed, breath came quick, body grew chill Spasms rent his frame; his poisoned flesh waxed white With blotches; soon he sank in mortal pain; Save where, after deep trance, Nature's kind might Flung the taint forth:‚Äîthen quick he rose again. Thus, on the self-same day, the Pestilence Smote these fair lovers, fated bitterly. Sighed Majn√ªn, 'mid his friends: ‚ÄúNow go I hence, Never again my Lady's face to see! Never again in this world! Nay‚Äîand worse! Never in that beyond; for she will be Where Christians are. Sing not another verse Of the Death-Sura! Pray no prayers for me To Allah! If a Mussulman I die I shall gain Paradise, but not with her; Christ! take me where she goes! Lord Isa, I Am Nazarene, as Mariam!‚Äù The stir Of Mollahs rending robes, and curses bitter Of angry kin, his earnest accents drown; In a waste place the bearers of his litter Unburied flung that outcast's body down. But while for Mariam's sake Majn√ªn foreswore Friends, Faith, and Paradise, his lady lay Sick as to death‚Äînot knowing how they bore Her chosen forth‚Äîand all that piteous day ‚ÄúMajn√ªn!‚Äù she sighed, ‚ÄúOh, Majn√ªn, Pearl of Lovers! Death cometh, and we shall not meet again! Nevermore, my Soul's Life! the black grave covers Thy poor white Dove, whose feathers thou wert fain ‚ÄúOfttimes to smooth and kiss; and,‚Äîwoe is me!‚Äî Whither I go there canst thou never come; For thou art of the Prophet's tribes; and we Another people, with another home ‚ÄúBeyond this world. But, see now, Jesu tender! In all thy Father's Houses which would give Rest to my soul? what untold joy and splendour Could comfort Mariam, if she might not live ‚ÄúForever, and forever, and forever With Majn√ªn, be that Heaven, or be it Hell? If he may come where Thou art never‚Äînever‚Äî Oh, Christ, my Lord! then let me go to dwell ‚ÄúIn what place for his peace Allah is keeping!‚Äù And those around her bed chided the Maid, Deeming she raved; but dreamlike, as if sleeping, Soft went she on, and this in whispers said: ‚ÄúDear God, forgive! if pardon for such sin Hath been or can be; still, I cannot take A path beyond the tomb he walks not in, A heaven he will not share. Therefore, I make ‚ÄúSad choice, but settled:‚Äîletting go Thy love Ah, gentle Christ! lest I lose his, and sit Amid Thine angels in the bliss above Winning Thy bless√´d peace, and hating it ‚ÄúFor lack of Majn√ªn. Is it Heaven's command None shall attain it, save at thy fair feet? Then he will not attain! But I must stand Beside Majn√ªn before the judgment-seat! ‚ÄúOh, any Death save parting! any doom Except what sunders us! Forgive, dread Lord! Friends, is it evening? round me swims the room! Listen! bury sad Mariam in the yard ‚ÄúWhere lie the Muslims of our quarter. Yea! I bid ye list‚ÄîI, who was Nazarene All my true maiden years, die here to-day A Mussulman√Æ! What his faith hath been ‚ÄúThat same is mine! hear me! I testify There is no God but Allah, and‚Äî‚Äù They smote The little trembling lips, and drove that cry Of tender heresy back in her throat, Whose milky beauty throbbed‚Äîand hushed. And, then, Scorning the renegade, they tore the Cross From her cold breast, and bade the ‚Äúbearing-men‚Äù In that waste spot her sham√´d body toss Where Majn√ªn's lay. So, thus it was beheld, When the Moon rose upon the dismal plain, The jackals, prowling 'mid the corpses, yelled And fled, to see a dead man rise again; For Majn√ªn rose, healed by his trance; and spied Death-pale, yet breathing, moving, beautiful, Mariam his lady, Mariam at his side; Mariam! and life not finished!‚ÄîDutiful With tenderest lips he touched her face, her head; Warmed with his breast her bosom; chafed her feet Full-softly, like two fair white birds, half-dead; And spake her name, murmuring such love-words sweet That through the numbed sense to the drowsy heart Stole their awakening music, and she lifted Her silken lids,‚Äîand gazed‚Äîand with glad start Flew to his neck. Oh, when were lovers gifted With such a splendid moment? For some space Hung they together, feedling life with kisses,‚Äî Each kiss a cordial‚Äîthen they left that place With faint rejoicing steps. And what long blisses Were theirs for many years verse cannot tell. Dear! do you like my Jacynth for its story? Yet, where, at Death. those loving souls did dwell Who knows? God's many names may have one glory! A. [‚ÄúWhat! A gold coin amid these jewelled treasures!] ‚ÄúWhat! A gold coin amid these jewelled treasures! Why send me such a relic?‚Äù‚Äîso you say‚Äî ‚ÄúGood to enhance some antiquary's pleasures; Stamped for dead people, in a buried day!‚Äù True, now, but look a little! If one ponder The legend of this piece, its gold may shine With lustre leaving dull the gems of wonder Which I did lay in those dear hands of thine. An Aureus of the Roman Empire‚Äîsee! And, on its face, in plain imperial letters, MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS‚ÄîHe Was Master of our earth. Rome's iron fetters, Linked over lands and seas, were held by him, The awful purple of the C√¶sars wearing; And triumph-crowned! for, mark, along the rim DEVICTIS MARCOMANNIS. He was bearing That year Pannonian laurels (one‚Äîsix‚Äîeight‚Äî In era of our Lord). Gaze on the face Pictured from one most noble, wise, and great, First of his age, and foremost of his race. Consider! Pious souls have been, but he Feared Heaven, worshipped himself! And just have been; But he, higher than Law, bowed down to be Law's officer! Well-taught, in books deep-seen, Daily he sate at school! Master of war, Bloodshed he stayed; pitied his vanquished foes; Pardoned his haters! Set far off, a Star Of sovereignty, he ranked himself with those Born to serve Man! Enriched with all the East, With all the West; Lord of the wealth of Rome; He lay on earth, drank from the stream, made feast Of fruits and roots! Yet, to rear porch and dome Stately at Athens, splendid on old Nile; To dower learning, scatter truth, spread good; To help the thoughts which help mankind meanwhile For those he poured his sesterces in flood! Majestic, melancholy, lofty, mild; Holier than saints, than sages more enrapt; One hour listening to Fronto like a child, The next, in royal paludamentum lapped Governing the world! Ah, measure what a man! White in an age dark and unbeautiful: Highest, yet humblest: since the kings began No heart so kingly, large, and dutiful. Regard him! does my Emperor pleasure you? Being but a man I only know that here‚Äî If we shall set apart some three or two‚Äî The flower of humankind blooms bright and dear. This is the best we are! ‚ÄúVerissimus‚Äù Hadrian did style him! When the Senate named Marcus sole C√¶sar, spake he: ‚ÄúSeat with us My Lucius Verus also; I were blamed Keeping no place upon his Father's throne Whose Father loved me.‚Äù When the eagles fled Before the Marcomanni, he alone‚Äî Loathing red war‚Äîthe reeling legions led To victory. At his life‚Äîtoo pure to please‚Äî Avidius Cassius aimed, joining foul hands With C√¶sar's beauteous Empress: foiling these The loving peoples and the loyal bands Slew that arch rebel, sent his severed head A tribute to the Court; but Marcus sighed Seeing the bloody gift; and, musing, said: ‚ÄúHappier I were to pardon!‚Äù when he spied The accusing list, setting in deadly row Names of the plotters, royally he rends The scroll to shreds; quoth he: ‚ÄúLet me not know Mine enemies, till I have made them friends!‚Äù And as he lived, so died he; grand and meek, Maintaining Antonine's sublimity, Who, for last watchword, hardly strong to speak, Gave the centurion ‚ÄúEquanimity.‚Äù Hear Marcus teach: ‚ÄúIf thou with Gods would'st dwell, Keep a contented mind; follow that guide Whom Jove hath lodged within thy breast to tell His will, and lead thee to the better side. ‚ÄúEither the Universe is Chaos, Chance; Or else the Universe is Order, Law; If that‚Äîdie! and let pass the drunken dance; If this‚Äîlive and rejoice, in Love and Awe. ‚ÄúOffer that inner rule of Heaven's high Lord A strong soul ripened by the life below; A soldier at his post waiting the word; A heart too grateful to be loath to go. ‚ÄúAll which befitteth thee, befitteth me, Thou Scheme of God! What to thee cometh right To me comes right: if life or death it be So let it be; good is it in my sight, ‚ÄúIf good in Jove's! Oh Mother Earth! I take My rest with thee, right gladly lying down; What! shall the poets praise Athens, and make Songs to the City of the Violet Crown, ‚ÄúAnd none praise Jove's great City, where we spent Our span of yeats? 'Twas sweet therein to dwell; Yet being bid to quit, go well content! No tyrant orders; no harsh laws compel! ‚ÄúWho opened thee the City-gates, now closes; Who named thee freeman, sends thee off the wall: Depart obedient! Is there one supposes The Ruler of the Rulers knows not all? ‚ÄúDepart submissive, glad! Die unrepining! There is a Greater guardeth thee than thou, Dearer than to thyself thy life's combining Was to the Cosmos; death is better now!‚Äù Was he not perfect? Will you scorn to wear His aureus 'mid the gems? Yet lurking wonders Perplex male minds, studying your strange sex, Dear! For gazing on his countenance one ponders That grudge Faustina bore him. She‚Äîhis wife‚Äî Sharing the Purple, Lady of his glory, Stained the imperial honours of his life With shameful passions. Nay, I spare the story! They knew it‚Äîto the lowest Roman slave: Living he would not punish; dead he made her Obsequies splendid; stateliest mourning gave, And in a glorious milk-white tomb he laid her. Ah, you will wear! You sternly judge Faustine! Yet one point more:‚Äîhis sword he whetted sharp, To smite the followers of the Nazarene; Hated the Christians, and burned Polycarp‚Äî For Rome's great sake! You lay it by again! But, this‚Äîat best‚Äîwe are; doubtless, 'tis pity He could not love our gentle Christ, nor win One woman's breast. Still, when he died, his City Voted him God; and every citizen Bought bronzes of him, built them shrines at home; Made him their household Lar, their Man of men; Faustina's fool, Christ's foe, crowned saint of Rome! I. [See now! an Ivory Casket for your treasures] See now! an Ivory Casket for your treasures, Cut from a tusk some lord of Elephants Yielded, besieged amid his forest-pleasures, By circling foes. The creamy surface vaunts Turquoise, in blue stars set, with Iolite, That violet-tinted gem which somewhile hides In Indian hills. Azures and purples bright Play daintily across its sparkling sides! And, look! the Casket bears so rich a labour Of chiselled work, and stones, it may have been By day the white delight, at night the neighbour Of the soft slumbers of some Hindoo Queen. It may be wrought‚Äîwho knows? of ivory Taken from tooth of Raja Megh Koomar. A famous Prince of Magadha was he, Gentle in peace, and generous in war, An elephant, in his last life but one,‚Äî 'Tis the Jain story‚Äîfor a woodland-fire Brake forth, consuming trees and grass. Undone The forest-creatures died. Wider and higher The red tongues raged; whereat this kingly beast. Betook himself for flight; when‚Äîfrom the reeds‚Äî A striped bush‚Äîmouse, of all things last and least, Leaped forth, and ran between his feet, and pleads To Raja Megh: ‚ÄúAhi! great Prince! permit I take asylum from this dreadful flame Betwixt thy mighty legs!‚Äù Megh looked on it: ‚ÄúSmall art thou!‚Äù quotha ‚Äúyet is life the same Brother! for thee as me. Stay where thou art! I never spurned aught living, nor shall now; Sit close and fear not; I will not depart!‚Äù Therewith he faced the fire, wielding a bough Of thick-leaved S√¢l, to beat the heat away; Which curled and hissed, and scorched, blistering one limb And all his length of trunk, so sore‚Äîthey say‚Äî Megh died ere night; but saved the mouse. And him In the next life the just Gods made a king. Mark, too, your casket's milky sides, how full Of imagery! Here's a subtle thing‚Äî A banyan-tree, whereat, with steadfast pull, Toils a tusked Elephant to lay it low; And 'mongst the dropping branches two which bear A long-tailed clinging monkey, feeding so On the red figs, he has no eyes to fear Those two rats, one so black, and one so white, Which nibble at the branches: but beneath A pit gapes, where you see the lurid light Of snake-shapes twisting, and grim signs of death. Shall I interpret? Life's the banyan tree; Which Death, the elephant, in dust would lay; And the poor foolish ape is Man; and, see! This black rat is the Night, the white the Day, Which ever gnaw, in turn, at life's thin branches Whereto man clings; till, blind with sense and sin, Fat with world's figs, down rolls he to those trenches Dug by Death's feet, with serpents hid therein. But here's a fairer legend carved! A balance Wherein they weigh a Prince against a Dove; An Eagle looking on! the Eagle's talons Bloody; the Prince's face alight with love! Shall I interpret? Raja Sagaras This is; for kindly heart of large renown: One morning, when in full Divan he was, A white dove through the lattice fluttered down, Her silver plumage pink with blood, and ruffled; And, following on fierce wings, an Eagle. She, Nigh dead with fear, her fainting pinions muffled In the King's breast-cloth, seeking sanctuary Close to his heart. Then screamed the cruel bird ‚ÄúGive me my prey, just King!‚Äù But Sagaras Fondling the Dove, said: ‚ÄúNever is it heard A prince repelled his suppliant!‚Äù Hot as brass Glared the great Eagle's eyes while it did cry: ‚ÄúI conjure thee by justice! She is mine! We drave her from the wood, my mate and I, We hunger! give the pigeon's meat‚Äîor thine!‚Äù ‚ÄúThou hast thy right,‚Äù answered the King, ‚Äúbut I The right to ransom; bring me scales, and weigh My flesh against this dove's.‚Äù So, fearlessly Drew he a sword, and lopped his hand away. The bird weighed more! More of his bleeding flesh Shore that kind Prince; yet still mounted the scale! Add what he would, heaping fresh gifts on fresh, The Dove proves aye the heavier! To prevail Into the balance then himself he laid, Pallid and fainting, ‚Äúfor‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúa King Were liever dead, and eagle's food, than made A shame through ages, doing such a thing!‚Äù Thereat‚Äîthe legend runs‚Äîthe Drums of Heaven Beat tender music, and strange blossoms rained Out of the sky; and from those oceans seven, Which ring our Earth, came Spirits of Bliss, constrained By such sweet deed to show themselves, and praise My Raja carven here: also the Dove Shook off her feathers, and great Uma was Shiva's fair Queen, Mother of Light and Love! And the black Eagle into Dharma turned The God of Justice; and the Raja's hurts Were healed; and all the hearts of people burned With worship! So had Mercy her deserts. . . . Another sculptured side! A mango-tree Laden with fruit: one who a hatchet bears Of black hue; one breaking a branchlet,‚Äîsee!‚Äî Blue-visaged; while a third, red-featured, tears Raw mangoes down: a fourth sits in the leaves Eating the ripest;‚Äîhe is yellow: five Is this light-tinted Rishi who receives The fallen fruit, and passes. Shall I give Interpretation? 'Tis a parable Of mortals using life and living things; A Hindoo Artist's fable; he would tell By colours who is wise, and which man brings Shame on himself and sorrow to his kind. Black, with vile selfishness, is he that goes, To hew the tree for mangoes to his mind; Conquerors and criminals are such as those. And not quite black‚Äîbut blue‚Äîthis egotist Who breaks a branch to reach some rosy fruit; Such be seducers, profligates; I wist Small thought have they of the sad withered shoot! A little fairer-tinted‚Äîred‚Äîis he Who will not harm branchlet or trunk; yet mounts Into the thickest harvest of the tree, Plucking what comes: and this man‚Äîyellow‚Äîcounts Better complexion still, who only takes The ripe fruits, made for eating. But the best Behold him in that patient saint who makes The fallen ones suffice! His hues attest‚Äî (White or wheat-coloured)‚Äîthat the carver meant him The sweet contented soul who seeks small share Gratefully, and goes by: since Heaven hath sent him To serve and work, not feast and wanton here. Ah! the last panel! Asia's secrets those, Cut with proud patience on the creamy tooth! Here you divine a form serene which shows Smooth perfect limbs, and glorious grace of youth; One side all male, and one all tender woman; The right-half God, but Goddess all the left; With braided hair, full bosoms, beauties human: Over its head a bat, and water-eft; Beneath, a climbing plant shoots three-fold leaves, With pale blue flowerets. 'Tis our Hindoo's way To teach how ‚ÄúMaya's‚Äù subtle art deceives By double sexes, forms of things which play In various disguise of ‚ÄúHe‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe,‚Äù Of serpent, beast, and bird; of moving lives, And lives not moving. ‚ÄúAll is phantasy! There is one Being only!‚Äù this he strives To carve upon the casket, showing us Ardhanar√Æshwara‚Äîfemale and male‚Äî Who hath both natures; and the bat proves thus That mouse and bird unite, as skin and scale Meet in the eft. The plant with triple leaf Ah, that's a marvel of our Indian jungle! Dull botanists‚Äîwho flout the sweet belief That Dryads live, and with harsh Latin bungle Tree use and beauty‚Äîthose have never told Half ardently Desmodium's miracle! If you should watch its buds of blue and gold And light green leaflets, you would see them tell Minute by minute the day-watches all, And all the hours of night, ever alert; One petiole rising while the others fall; A herb which lives and moves, and doth assert A soul of sentience overpassing bounds Set for the leafy world. Have we not seen In sunny Singhalesian garden-grounds, The grasses shrink where our quick steps had been, Modest and timid as a maid that blushes, But is not to be touched? Flowers, too, there be Which sparkle flame in opening; one that flushes Scarlet, at sunset only. Briefly, he‚Äî Our Hindoo‚Äîthinks men, creatures, trees all one; He calls Desmodium a mystic name. But close the Casket's lid! I were undone If this should weary you. Now shines the flame D. [Of Dawn-stone! rare Sandastros!‚Äîpiedra pura!] Of Dawn-stone! rare Sandastros!‚Äîpiedra pura! My servants bring this gem from Yucatan: See! in one light 'tis ruddy like Aurora, And in another pallid gold. . . . A man Died, save for this! Ah, but so long ago You need not sigh; yet, if you ask the story, Believe that every jewel here below Hath some Familiar dwelling in its glory. How shall we question now? Mark, on the gem, Strange signs incised‚ÄîMexican symbols graved By Montezuma's priests‚Äîthe speech of them Was Aztec: let the stone be three times waved, And say, in ancient Aztec phrase, demurely, ‚ÄúSprite of the Jewel, speak! whence springest thou? What is thy tale?‚Äù‚ÄîOh, it will answer, surely!‚Äî Behold! a little brown-eyed damsel now Appears, in feathered garb, and plaited tresses, As the soft Indians used when Cortez came! Listen! with low obeisance she addresses The mistress of the stone: ‚ÄúMy wearer's name ‚ÄúWas young Ay√¢ni‚Äîdaughter to the priest Of Tezicatlepotchli, God of day; In Anahuac, at the yearly feast, The fairest captive youth they chose, to lay ‚ÄúBound, on the Blood-Rock of the Pointed Hill‚Äî The Teo-calli‚Äîfor thus was our Law:‚Äî The people beat the snake-drums, and blew shrill Their pipes of bone, whilst the Chief-Priest did draw ‚ÄúHis knife of splintered itztli through the flesh Cutting from East to West; and so did take The throbbing heart away, and burn it fresh Upon the Sun-God's altar. But to make ‚ÄúCostlier that noble offering to Heaven, For twelve glad moons before the day of doom Honour and love to the fair boy were given; They built him in the Golden House a room ‚ÄúLike a God's chamber, gay with many a thing Of grace and ornament; and richly laid With cougar-skins and mats: where slaves did bring‚Äî Each eve‚Äîbaskets of grapes, and cakes new-made, ‚ÄúWith cactus-wine and honey, spreading soft His bed for love and sleep; since always there Tender ones waited, waving high aloft Fans of pied feathers, that the fragrant air ‚ÄúMight kiss his brow and cheeks. And lovely gardens Opened beyond the chamber, where there grew All the fair fruits our southern summer hardens, Stately great trees, and blooms of every hue. ‚ÄúAnd there would lie Ay√¢ni, with her lover, For she was noblest, and our law was this; That‚Äîtill those twelve good moons were past and over‚Äî The sweetest lips, the proudest breasts were his, ‚ÄúThe best the Land could give. Mine was the jewel Her throat bore when its dusky beauty spread‚Äî In those swift hours of joy, tender and cruel,‚Äî A pillow for his happy, fated head. ‚ÄúThere would Ay√¢ni lie, making delight For him whose heart must smoke upon the stone: Girding with buds of river-roses white That breast the flint must open, flesh and bone! ‚ÄúAnd she would sing our ancient temple-song‚Äî Sad and bewitching‚Äîsaying Life is this: A dream whose vague delight lasts never long; A swift night swallowing up brief day of bliss: ‚ÄúOr, with low kissing-cry would call away The humming birds, that quivered at the blooms, To nestle in her neck and hands, and lay The honey-quest aside, trilling their plumes ‚ÄúTo please the pair. This glory of my gem, Which trembles with the colours of the Morn, Hath no such radiance as the tints of them‚Äî Winged jewels of their Garden. One was borne ‚ÄúOn spinions of pale green, melting to black By bronze and russet passages, its head Alight with blazing ruby, and its back Afire with flashing sapphire. Some word said ‚ÄúWould bring that tiny splendour, glittering, Forth from the trumpet-blossom's perfumed cup, To brood amid Ay√¢ni's hair, each wing Brilliantly spread, and the crest lifted up ‚ÄúA tongue of flickering flame. And one bird‚Äîdressed All silver and soft blues, with tufts of silk At each white flank‚Äîwould fly fond to her breast, And hang between its hills of tinted milk, ‚ÄúDarting in play his bill's black slender curve, Now this side and now that, as if what grew On those hill-tops were buds enough to serve For flowers and nectar. And another flew‚Äî ‚ÄúWhene'er Ay√¢ni summoned‚Äîto her lip, A little starry speck whence keen beams gleamed Of gold and purple, in bright fellowship With dark green gorget, and a neck that seemed ‚ÄúPlumaged from rainbows. ‚ÄòFeed! my Rose-ball, Feed!‚Äô The girl would murmur, and the bird would poise His bright enamelled breast, and blossomy head Before her open laughing mouth, with noise ‚ÄúOf whirring wings; plunging the amethyst Of his small frontlet, and his gold-mailed neck Into that rosy hollow‚Äîsweet, I wist, As any rose's heart‚Äîand feign to suck ‚ÄúAy√¢ni's honey! Yet another minion‚Äî Corseletted all in crimson scales, and thighed With topaz and with turquoise; either pinion Splashed with red gilding, and each shoulder dyed ‚ÄúBlood-purple‚Äîhe would perch upon her ear, Sit in its pearly cavern; you had thought A live fire-opal from Papantla there Burgeoned and blazed! With other cries she brought ‚ÄúOther fair woodland creatures; lizards plated With grey and amber armour; mottled snakes Pink-mouthed and sheeny; great-eyed musk-deer, sated With browsing flowers. The jacamar, who makes ‚ÄúA nest in reeds, left its red eggs to go Where the girl called; the grunting peccaries Gazed at her through the aloes; white as snow The egrets clustered round her. He that lies ‚ÄúCouched in the canes, a terror of the wood,‚Äî The clouded jaguar,‚Äîwhen Ay√¢ni sung Dropped the red fragments from his jaws, and stood At the brake's edge to hear. Slowly unclung ‚ÄúHis coils the anaconda from the limb Where he lay knotted; and, all spell-bound, drew His massive freckled folds through twilights dim Of the deep forest, hastening near to view ‚ÄúThat soft-voiced woman. All along the leaves Of the Royal lilies, where their lush growth lies Crowning with green and red the river-waves, The plovers raced to greet her. Butterflies‚Äî ‚ÄúAzure and silver-dappled, black and gold‚Äî Drew towards her as they draw to some bright blossom; Ah, for a jewelled queen! 'twas to behold Ay√¢ni with the sun-birds in her bosom, ‚ÄúAnd those gay fluttering fulgencies alight On her dark hair! She had such charm of love 'Twould stay the nursing toucan in her flight, And fetch the hungry condor from above ‚ÄúTo circle nigh: the clavin‚Äîsinging sweet Beyond all warblers‚Äîand four-handed folk, Bonnetted, furred, hook-tailed, all to her feet Crept wooingly, and took the gentle yoke, ‚ÄúIn joy and peace, of young Ay√¢ni. So Flew the delicious days, till that day came, The last of love. ‚ÄòHoney of life! Dost know?‚Äô The captive said: ‚Äòto-morrow morn the flame ‚Äú‚ÄòWill eat the heart which so adores thee?‚Äô ‚ÄòDear!‚Äô The Girl made answer: ‚ÄòI was set to soothe Thy dying times, not love thee: yet, this year Hath made our spirits one! Ay√¢ni's youth, ‚Äú‚ÄòAy√¢ni's mirth and comfort go with thee! Alas, the hateful stone! the cruel knife! The awful God! But, if this offering be, How shall I live alone, who am thy wife, ‚Äú‚ÄòGreat with thy child? Look now! 'tis dark! array thee In my bark mantle; bind around thy waist My belt of feathers. Fly! If any stay thee, This jewel is the sign! Speak nothing! Haste! ‚Äú‚ÄòShow them my stone, and pass! Hide in the wood! Less bitter are the beasts than men who pray!‚Äô Vainly he clung and kissed; vainly withstood, She thrust him forth to save him. When 'twas day ‚Äú‚ÄòThey found him fled. Then, all the angry folk Cried death against Ay√¢ni, who had cheated Great Tezicatlepotchli of his smoke Of sacrifice. But she their spite defeated; ‚ÄúFor, lying bound, she summoned from the brake,‚Äî By some low word her woodland creatures knew, And understood‚Äîa slender ribboned snake Which coiled, obedient, round her wrist, and drew ‚ÄúOne ruby blood-drop, with right-loving tooth.‚Äî So did Ay√¢ni win escape. My gem Hath this for story!‚Äù‚Äî If thy tale be truth, Sprite of the Stone! who would not pity them? E. [Euclase! and Essonite! the last and rarest‚Äî] Euclase! and Essonite! the last and rarest‚Äî With Evening Emerald, surnamed Peridot!

A secret of Brazilian streams, which bring Once in twelve moons to sight‚Äîthe schist-drifts under‚Äî The tender glories of this subtle thing. Sometimes a honey-yellow, sometimes green As leaves against the light, then shot with flakes Of pale sea-blue, but all three Colours seen As Nature wills; for the keen crystal takes No touch of wheel. Its fragile charms forbid A goldsmith's labour; when the Maker made Euclase, ‚ÄúLet there lie, in My Rivers hid, One perfect thing man shall not mar!‚Äù He said. And Essonite‚Äîstyled ‚Äústone of Cinnamon‚Äù‚Äî The garnet Greek and Tuscan used to grave With beauty, best and sweetest under sun, Faces of Gods, and Heroes great and brave! Gold, fired with crimson beams, so glows this gem, Cut to a beetle's shape, the sacred Scarab Of dead Egyptians. Note the signs of them Quaint hieroglyphs! Some ≈íthiop or Arab Wore this in life and death; and no man knows His name or deeds! But your name men shall know Reading these jewelled letters which compose Its gentle music; for my verse will go‚Äî Glad with the light of Love and you‚Äîto days When better poets live, and Life,‚Äîmade strong By sheaves of our sad sowing-time‚Äîshall praise Ladies we sang, and graces of our song. Last comes my Peridot, the stone of Eve, Tinted as evening skies are when their blue Blends with the gold and grey, till we believe Asphodel valleys open, and 'tis true That bless√´d spirits tread green meads in Heaven. This is the ‚Äúprecious olivine‚Äù men trace In cliffs of Nile; and sometimes it is riven From those black massy bolts hurled out of space Upon our Earth. Whence come they? Birds of wonder, Flying on fearful pinions from the Vast Wherein all swims; lighting, mid flame and thunder, In the scorched fields. The Indian blacksmith's blast Forges a sword therefrom of splendid water: I pluck a jewel, Dear! for Love can bring Gladness from grief, high hope from death and slaughter, Light out of Darkness, good from everything! October (Written in description of a picture painted by her.) A bold brunette she is, radiant with mirth, Who comes a-tripping over corn-fields cropped; Fruits and blown roses from her full arms dropped, Carpet her feet along the gladdened earth. And on her brow glitters a careless crown Of bronz√®d oak, and apple-leaves, and vine; And russet-nuts and country berries twine About her gleaming shoulders and loose gown. Like grapes at vintage, where the ripe wine glows, Glows so her sweet cheek, summer-touched but fair; And, like grape-tendrils, all her wealth of hair, Gold on a ground of brown, nods as she goes: Grapes too, a-spirt, her brimming fingers bear A dainty wine-press, pouring wet and warm The crimson river over wrist and arm, And on her lips‚Äîadding no crimson there! Ah! splendid autumn hours‚Äîfly not so fast! Let this rich Lady long with us delay; The sunset makes the sun so wished-for‚Äîstay! Of three sweet months the loveliest and the last! But after laughter ever follows grief, And Pleasure's sunshine brings its shadow Pain; Even now begins the dreary time again, The first dull patter of the first dead leaf. Dedication of a Volume of Translations Flowers from Greek gardens, Fannie! old turned new, Doric, √Üolic, Attic gathered here: You made the pleasant sunshine where they grew; Such as the growth is, have the blossoms, Dear! To ‚ÄúStella.‚Äù Sweet Planet! strangely seen, suddenly loved At the first eye-glance of our midnight meeting! I look back on the ways whereby I moved To this fair fate, my lonely life completing: I did not seek you, Dear! no vision tender Bade me expect you by my rayless road! There was no dreamy dawning of the splendour Your white light shed! no morning-grey that showed Where my Star waited under life's horizon!‚Äî Ah, far, pure, silvery Star! set not again! Better no lamp to fix the sailor's eyes on, Than one brief beam cast on the cold dark main! A Duet He: ‚ÄúAh!‚Äîif you knew! if I dared to discover Half that my heart feels to-day: If there were words for so faithful a lover, Fair enough, fond enough,‚Äîsay!

Oh, Sweet! if you knew!‚ÄùShe: ‚ÄúHow can I know, when a glance of relenting Stays the love-whisper, half-said? How can I know when,‚Äîwhile I am consenting, ‚ÄòNo‚Äô‚Äîis the sentence you dread?

The harvest-moon stands on the sea, Her shining rim's adrip; She gilds the sheaves on many a lea, The sails on many a ship; Glitter, sweet Queen, upon the spray, And glimmer on the heather; Right fair thy ray to show the way Where lovers walk together. The red wheat rustles, and the vines Are purple to the root, And true love, waiting patient, wins Its blessed time of fruit. Lamp of all lovers, Lady-moon, Light these glad lips together Which reap alone a harvest sown Long ere September weather. To a Sleeping Lady. Darling! as you lie there sleeping, with the holy angels keeping Watch and ward around your pillow, shading it with wings of gold‚Äî Sentinels whose happy duty is to guard your grace and beauty‚Äî While you lie there dreaming, seeming all your sweet self, calm and cold, Who would think that the true treasure of that casket, beyond measure Rich, and fair, and finished, is not where the quiet casket lies? That they see the palace-portal set ajar, and the Immortal Gone forth from its rosy gateway, locking satin lids on eyes? Yet so it is. Sweetest woman! and what's there is but the human Robe and raiment which your spirit wears, to walk with all the rest, Regal raiment! Ah! the silky wavelets of that hair! the milky Whiteness of the brow, the neck, the small hands folded o'er the breast! As a Queen's grace seems to linger in the pearl-strings which her finger Loosened‚Äîso thy soul leaves glory on that sleeping form of thine; But the slender, fair, still body is not that which most I worship, And your soul‚Äîmy Pride! my Bride!‚Äîis here, and talking low with mine. All because, at such an hour, Love hath so much charm and power, Life hath so much deeper knowledge of its march and mystery, That so soon as I invite it‚Äîcoy no longer, but delighted, Forth thy quick and gentle spirit comes for fellowship with me. And, beside my spirit sitting, thoughts with deep thoughts interknitting, Speaking plainly in a silence clearer, dearer far than speech, Mine grows all thine inmost being; and I see thee more than seeing‚Äî I and thou as one together; blended, ended, each in each. ‚ÄúStudents' Day‚Äù in the National Gallery (Written when she was copying the Madonna of Perugino. May 1868.) Out of all the hundred fair Madonnas Seen in many a rich and distant city‚Äî Sweet Madonnas, with the mother's bosoms; Sad Madonnas, with the eyes of anguish; Rapt Madonnas, caught in clouds to heaven‚Äî (Clouds of golden, glad, adoring Angels‚Äî) She of Florence, in the chair‚Äîso perfect! She that was the ‚ÄúGrand Duke's‚Äù wealth and glory, She that makes the picture ‚Äúof the Goldfinch,‚Äù Ghirlandajo's, with the cloak and jewels, Guido's Queen, whom men and angels worship; Della Robbia's best; and that sweet ‚ÄúPerla‚Äù‚Äî Seville's bright boast‚ÄîMary of Murillo, (Painted‚Äîso they vow‚Äî‚Äúwith milk and roses‚Äù) Guido Reni's Quadro at Bologna, Munich's masterpiece, grim Durer's Goddess; Yes! and thy brave work‚ÄîBeltraffio mio!‚Äî Many as the lessons are I owe them, Thanks and wonder; worship; grateful memories, Oftenest I shall think of Perugino's. Do you know it? Either side a triptych Stands an armed Archangel‚Äîas to guard her‚Äî Glorious‚Äîwith great wings, and shining armour: In the middle panel, pure and tender, Clasping close her hands, with adoration, (All the Mother's love‚Äîthe Mortal's worship‚Äî In their yearning, in their reverence, painted) Gazes Mary on the Child. A seraph Holds Him, smiling, at her knees; and, smiling, Looks she down, with spirit humbly-happy, Full‚Äîto heart's brim‚Äîof the Peace of Heaven. Reverence mingles with the Mother's passion, But no touch of sadness, or of doubting. Far away a river runneth seaward, (Little now‚Äîlike Truth‚Äîlike Truth, to widen) Leads the light across a blue dim country, Under peaks‚Äîby forests‚Äîto the ocean: Soft and warm, a pearly sky broods over Where three Winged-Ones, at the Father's footstool, Sing the ‚Äúpeace and good-will‚Äù song to mortals. If you ask me why that Perugino Of the rest can never be forgotten, Let this serve: I learned a lesson by it, Watching one whose light and faithful fingers‚Äî Following touch by touch her lovely labour‚Äî Caught the Master's trick, and made him modern. While she bent above her new Madonna, Laid the lucid smalts, and touched the crimsons, Swept the shadows under the gilt tresses, Smoothed the sinless brows, and drooped the eyelids,‚Äî What the Master did, so also doing,‚Äî I bethought me ‚ÄúTrue and good the toil is! Noble thus to double gifts of beauty! Yet, alas! this ‚Äòpeace and good-will‚Äô anthem,‚Äî If the dear Madonna knew what ages‚Äî Slowly following ages‚Äîwould creep o'er us, And those words be still as wind that passes, Breathing fragrance from a land we know not, Sighing music to a tune we catch not, Stirring hearts, as leaves, i' the night, a little Shake, and sleep again, and wait for sunlight, (Sweet, glad sunlight! oh, so long a-coming!) Would she smile so? I had painted rather‚Äî (While she listened to those singing Angels,) Mary, with a sword-blade in her bosom, (Sword that was to pierce her heart, of all hearts!) I had shown her with deep eyes of trouble, Half afraid to credit that Evangel; I had limned her ‚Äòpondering all those sayings,‚Äô All our later agonies foreseeing, After all our years have heard ‚Äòthe tidings.‚Äô‚Äù But the Artist, painting bold and largely, Washing soft and clear the broadening colours; With a liberal brush, at skilful working, Linking lights and shadows on the visage, Dropped by hazard there one drop of water! ‚ÄúLo, a tear!‚Äù I thought; ‚Äúthat teaches Pietro! That is wiser than the Master's wisdom! Now the picture's meaning will be perfect! For she could not be so calm‚ÄîChrist's Mother‚Äî Could she? even though Archangels kept her! Could she? even though those sang in Heaven! Knowing how her world would roll beyond them, Twenty centuries past this sacred moment, Out of sound of this angelic singing; Loaded with the wrongs Christ's justice rights not, Reddened with the blood Christ's teachings staunch not, Reeking with the tears Christ's pity stays not: Let the tear shine there! it suits the story! Tear and smile go wondrous well together! Seeing that this song was sung by Angels; Seeing that the foolish world gainsays it. That one lustrous drop completes the picture! You forgot it! Peter of Perugia!‚Äù Ah! I did not know an Artist's wisdom! I had still to learn my deepest lesson: She I watched, with better thought inspired, Took some tender colour in her pencil, (Faint dawn-colour,‚Äîblush of rose‚ÄîI marked not!) Touched the tear, and melted it to brightness, Spread it in a heavenly smile all over, Magically made it turn to service; Till that tear, charged with its rosy tintings, Deepened the first sweet smile, and left it lovelier,‚Äî Like the Master's work, complete, sufficient! Then I thought:‚ÄúPietro's wise Madonna Was too wise to weep at little sorrows! Christ, and She, and Heaven, and all the angels Last;‚Äî'tis sin, and grief, alone which passes! Roses grow of dew, and smiles from weeping! Sweetest smile is made of saddest tear-drop! She hath not forgotten we shall suffer! In her heart that sword‚Äîto the heft‚Äîis planted, But, beyond the years, she sees Time over; Past the Calvary she counts ‚Äòthe mansions.‚Äô Dear Madonna!‚Äîwise to be so happy! Should you weep, because we have not listened? We shall listen! and His mother knows it!‚Äù This is why‚Äîof many rare Madonnas,‚Äî Most of all I think on Perugino's; I who know so many more and love them! This is why I thank my gentle artist, She who taught me that, a student's wisdom! Memories. They never will read it, in this sad face, How I came, at last, to my Lady's grace; If they saw my heart they would hardly know It lies so close, and it lurks so low: So womanly went she, so gladsome and good, The charm of her never was understood; Till I‚Äîfor whom was the secret fine‚Äî Found her, and wooed her, and won her for mine. She knows‚Äîshe only! how slow and sweet My love grew up from the palms of her feet, From low at her foot to high on her brow, From Dear‚Äîand Dearer‚Äîto Dearest‚Äîtill now. There is none of her‚Äînone‚Äîthat I may not love, Beauty of earth, or bright spirit above; But only the Angels‚Äîand Fannie‚Äîknow Why, living and dying‚ÄîI love her so. In Absence. (Written in 1872, and found among her papers.) At home I sit without you, And find that ‚Äúhome‚Äù is you; Homeless at home, to miss you makes The soft words sound untrue: Not twice ten leagues divide us‚Äî A thousand they appear, Because to part heart's beat from heart Leaves entry-gate for fear. Are you safe‚Äîwell‚Äîand sleeping? You cannot answer me! Why should the faint electric pulse Throb under all the Sea, And mighty Love, past range of speech, Be dumb and deaf and blind Beyond such space as takes your face Too far for eyes to find? Dearest! I touch, with trembling, A cup of fate and fear! Your chair, your book, the rose you wore, Your hat, your gloves are here, But not what gave them charm! Lone seems This room, and lone above Will be‚ÄîI know‚Äîwhen there I go The nest of my white Dove. I touch a cup of sadness; Tasting the topmost drop Of what‚Äîif God should bid me drink‚Äî Would make all singing stop: Suppose that never more you came! As one who sets wild lips To dark drugged bowl, so my rash soul At that dread fancy sips; And, then, recoils in fancy As lips draw back in haste From the first deadly flavouring Of the sharp poison-taste. Ah! Heaven be praised! To-morrow, you Will sit in the old chair, The leagues will change to kissing-range, And I shall stroke your hair. Yet, since it might be, Darling! And‚Äîbeing‚ÄîI should need To say a hundred hurried things Of which Death takes no heed, I write one word of all those words As true as truth can be, For you to read, come back with speed Bright and alive to me: And this it is:‚ÄîI love you For troubles, cares, and fears; For faults and foolish angers, And whims and tiffs and tears, For sulks not less than sweetness, Sweet! For faith no more than doubt; Not counting nought those hours which brought Fondness by fallings-out. Yes! and if‚ÄîFannie!‚Äînever You sate by me again, And this feigned thought of sadness Were settled lasting pain, I should not say, ‚Äúwould I had shewn A nobler constancy!‚Äù As you in Heaven were all forgiven So I on Earth must be. If you were dead I should not Wish I had loved you more, Because heart-full is full‚Äîwhat failed Was body, when souls soar: But I should wish forgottens Rash acts and thoughts unkind Which chanced erewhile‚Äîthat I might smile Your soft faults out of mind. Well! one small word tells all things! ‚ÄúLove,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove‚Äù concludes, begins, Defines‚Äîexplains‚Äîexemplifies, Conciliates, comforts, wins; Assoils the sins we could not'scape, Sets right our wrong, and ends All grief of this with one soul-kiss Which links us lasting friends. Then hear it, Wife!‚ÄîThis midnight My spirit speaks to you That word of changless meaning By solitude made true: For, Sweet! if planets parted us Instead of leagues twice ten, As I who write love you to-night, So should I love you then. June 6, 1872. In the Death-Chamber. Now thou art come into thy blissful rest Forget me wholly, Dear! if to remember Troubles thy sojourn with the spirits blest, Dulls thy Heaven's June with clouds of Earth's December. Be happy as God wills! It were ill love To cling about an Angel's golden raiment Grudging her passage to the peace above, Asking from Paradise some gift for payment. Be speechless, still, reposeful, proud! Respond, By no reviving rose on that white cheek, To my last cry, despairing, doubting, fond; To this impassioned summons which I speak! Have thou no heed, so that with thee 'tis well! Kissing thy cold lips on this mournful morrow, Methinks they say, ‚ÄúI am too glad to tell One joy!‚Äù What matters, then, if I must sorrow! March 16, 1889. ‚ÄîSic sine vita Vivere quam suave est! sic sine morte mori! ‚ÄúWhat Adona√Øs is‚Äù‚Äîgreat Shelley said‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy fear we to become?‚Äù And that's well posed, For, since you can lie there, dear Mayflower! dead, With eyes which were so bright for ever closed, And lips which were so lightsome shut for ever, And hands which were so busy meekly linked, And laugh, never again to ring‚Äîah, never! And loving heart so still‚Äîwhy! Death has winked Over Love's foolish head at Life, revealing The riddle of his message. Now we know, For us and others, that what seemed such stealing Of our heart's treasure, was not really so. God, making her, must love her‚Äîthat's most certain! So‚Äîshe was weary and He drew her curtain. THE END</field>
