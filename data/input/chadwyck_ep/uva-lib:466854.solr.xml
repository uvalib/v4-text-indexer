      <field name="fulltext">TO THE AUTHOR OF THE CHRISTIAN YEAR, THIS VOLUME IS WITH HIS KIND PERMISSION RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED WITH THE HOPE THAT AGE MAY BRING TO KINDRED ASPIRATIONS A POETIC UTTERANCE UNWORLDLY AS HIS OWN. AMBLESIDE, THE FEAST OF ST. SIMON AND ST. JUDE, MDCCCXLII. XI. The Beginning of Term. Dear Oxford! far in hollow hills, And kept awake by flooded rills, This night I hear the many feet That pace thy steeple-shadowed street, The tide of youth in merry going Beneath the college windows flowing: And strange, most strange it seems to me At such an hour far off to be. I miss the evening thronged with greeting, The tumult of the autumnal meeting, When every face is fresh of hue, As though its life began anew. I almost wonder not to hear Some chosen voices speaking near. My very hand the air doth grasp In pressure kind or burning clasp: While with a pleasant, solemn strain The chapel bell wakes up again. And still to my believing eyes St. Mary's shadow seems to rise, All gently cast o'er every sense With its old wonted influence, Wherewith it hallowed many a night My ramblings in the cold moonlight, And thrills of joy and thoughts of good Were deepened by its neighborhood. And is it well that I should stand Apart in this sweet mountain-land? Oh! is it well that I should be Away from cares that chasten me, Away from men whose pattern still Could shame me out of weak self-will, Away from shrines too which could bless And nurture me in holiness? And is it not a wilful loss To be unburdened of a Cross? And in the life which I am living Is there no fountain of misgiving? Yet, ere I left, the path did seem Clear as a steady, shining beam; And to my vision there were leadings, And in my spirit there were pleadings, Which were impressed upon my sense As very seals of Providence. Ah! in a hundred little things, Like wavings of an Angel's wings, Far gleamy lights, dim beckonings, Methought it was in mercy given To trace the guiding thread of Heaven. But now my doubting spirit fails, And from past sin a mist exhales, Clouding the radiant track which showed, As then I deemed, the heavenly road. And every stone, whereon I thought Some lustrous token had been wrought, Some bright inscription, surely given For faith's interpreting from Heaven,â Though carved with broken letters still, Appears the work of past self-will. What did as Angel's foot-prints gleam Unholy imitations seem; And signs, which have not changed, display Their characters another way, And every fact the mind can bring Confirms the new interpreting. Oh Brother! when thou fain wouldst range From place to place, from change to change, Take not for heavenly light the glow Self-will can o'er the prospect throw. Sin is a prophet, who can cast Unerring light upon the past, But on the future makes to shine False sparkles which appear divine. XXX. Spring and Love. I Now am I an envious man, In whose veins there never ran Envy's fire till now; For I everywhere must see Birds that newly mated be, Sitting on the bough. II All things in the earth and air At their will consorted are, But alas! I only Am disconsolately stirred, Coveting to be a bird, To be no more lonely. III Ah! the stockdove when he woos Little knows how he pursues Me with melancholy; And without a hopeful flame I a lovelorn spirit am, By love wasted wholly. IV Thus I skim upon the wind, Seeking mates I cannot find, Like the first-come swallow; Or a breeze that silently Dies of loneliness at sea With no ship to follow. V Thus I made my plaint one day In the birds' nest month of May; And Spring said mockingly,â Woful caitiff! why so sad When the earth is all so glad For the love of me? VI Why the pied and pretty flowers Pluckest thou in all my bowers With such wanton waste? Why from all the splendors seen In this beechgrove, golden-green, Goest thou so fast? VII Though the songsters, two and two, Seek the vales and woodlands through Hidden nests to build, Yet the blossoms grow alone, Springing sweetly one by one In the meadow-field. VIII Nay, said I, the very flowers Have a suitor at all hours In the amorous breeze, And they grow in little beds, Leaning on each other's heads In bright companies. IX Well then, said the merry Season, If thou wilt not follow reason, Take thyself to rhyme; I will marry thought to thought, Till they shall be all enwrought By skill of my sweet time. X On their fingers shall be bound Rings of metre, links of sound, And fancy's orange-flowers; Thou shalt be this jocund May Full of these betrothals gay In thy secret bowers. XI Love the compact heard, and smiled, Like a mischief-making child, And dogged me on my way; When I wandered far or near, Still he whispered in my ear,â Thou art losing May! XII When I was mid flowers and trees, Then the fanning of the breeze Shewed me birds' nests there; For it put the leaves aside, And all round me I espied Birds' nests everywhere. XIII Still I wrote and wrote away, Making verses all the day, Striving not to hear What love daily, hourly spake, In sweeter verse than I could make, In my secret ear. XIV Then I listened for awhile, And I saw the urchin smile, Knowing I was won;â âTake heed thou art not belated, âIf thou art not quickly mated â'Ere youth's May is done.â XV So the pleasant warning rung, So all May the urchin sung Without change or stop; And the sound was never weary, Though it was full often dreary For the lack of hope. XVI O Rhyme! O Reason! when ye prove Untrue lieges to great Love, How are ye out-worn, With your offices and natures, And the sweetness of your features Utterly forsworn! XLVIII. The Dream of King CrÅsus. King CrÅsus dreamed a dream: the livelong day His heart was swollen with imperial pride, And his eye surfeited with blaze of gems And gleamy metals, and his weak ear soothed By fair-tongued Lydians: but in the still night King CrÅsus dreamed a dream: 'twas Nemesis That out of the mute darkness wove that dream. He slept, and in his sleep he saw his son, Atys, the beautiful, the chosen Atys, The youthful warrior,âhim he saw in dark, Confused embrace with hazy struggling forms, Masses, which peopled all the blank of night, Like bruised embossing on a lance-worn shield. He could not extricate from thence, nor clear One object which man's eye should recognize; Only he saw AtysâAtys he saw, His son, undoubted, manifest: ah woe! Only he saw Atys,âtorn with the point Of some invisible implement; he saw The point, and Atys, and his own child's blood. Such was the dream King CrÅsus dreamed that night. There is a sound as of a nuptial feast Throughout the low-roofed Sardis; tabor, lute And Phrygian pipe in sweet accord are there, Making such music as the easterns love, Monotonous and wailing: there are lights And cries and banquet sounds, and all the throng Of nuptial celebration. Dark and dim From Mother Dindymene's sacred hill Hermus flows down into the noisy plain, Where night is turned to day, and hurries on His waters troubled with the unwonted glare Into the quiet, misty distance. Oh Strange apparition is a flowing stream By a gay city in the obscure night! It is the nuptial feast of Atys. Ay, And will King CrÅsus baffle destiny, And flaunt the venerable Nemesis With nuptial feasts and women's chambers? Noâ For though the warrior's arms be laid aside, And though the boar-spear for the hunt be thrown In some neglected corner, though the walls That rang with armor wave with tapestry,â Yet sooner shall the soil instead of fruit Bring forth sharp-pointed things, and mortals reap Lance-heads for harvests, than the holy path Of orderly and reverend fate be turned This way or that. Mute matter and the beasts Achieve Heaven's wrath or love upon the earth. What ails the King? Why seeks he never now The vaulted treasure-house, the metals, gems, And costly inwrought works? His restless eye Is palled with brightness, and his regal prideâ That hath gone down, ay, sunk, for ever sunk In the deep ocean of paternal love. Yet wherefore looketh he with curious search Through all the palace and among his guards And on state days and in the public place, Lest a keen weapon or some pointed thing Should come nigh Atys? He would charm the life Of the brave, princely boy; he would rob fate (And cannot kings do all things?) of the prize. It is the Dream: that Dream is in his heart, Stirring, like spring within the unconscious earth Setting the unborn summer in array. The power that wove the Dream doth also work Out in the world. The toils of Nemesis Are closing round thee, CrÅsus! oh how near! There came a stranger to the Lydian court, A man of unclean hands, a fratricide, And yet withal a gentle being, one Whose noble blood of Phrygia's royal line Was least of his endowments; one of those Whose fortune is a mystery on the earth, A painful problem, gendering thought and tears Even in the sage, and in the unrestrained A refuge oft for easy misbeliefâ As though by some dread fate perversely thrown Upon the very opposite of all Their passions and propensions, not allowed To hit the scope at which their nature aims: Men are they, by compulsion of the world And the disturbing force of circumstance Led forth, like victims, out of their own sphere To act some other spirit's destiny: Who pass away, still having in themselves A better destiny all unfulfilled, A holier, milder being unevolved. Such was Adrastus, with a gentle tinge Of softness and a partial hallowing Of deep romance, an almost wayward love Of sadness, and a clinging to the woe Which had exhausted and absorbed the hope Of his whole being. He had shed the blood Of his own brother most unwittingly, And came to CrÅsus that from him he might Receive the expiation of the times,â A cleansing power, most rightly gathered up Into the state and person of the prince, A portion of divinity enthroned, Like a peculiar instinct, in a king, Who by his unity no less than by His height doth adumbrate the One Supreme. With running water and the kingly word Adrastus was made clean, and dwelt, a guest Of CrÅsus, I might almost say, a son. When by the hearth the stranger's shadow fell King CrÅsus knew not that it was the cloud Of Nemesis upon his royal house: So little venerable in our sight Is present Providenceâwhen past, how great! All things concur with Nemesis: she sent A fugitive from Phrygia thus to be Her shadow and her symbol in the house Of the great king whom she had singled out To teach men, by his eminence and griefs, The righteousness of Heaven. In other lands She makes fresh preparation, and the ring Of destiny is slowly narrowing in; The victim cannot stir, he cannot do A transitory act, but he therein Is riveting the future on himself. CrÅsus! awake! Thy Dream is on thee,ârise! Whence are these foreign husbandmen, who throng The audience hall at Sardis, suppliants rude? They are from pastoral Mysia, come to tell How a huge boar from rough Olympus robs The sheep-folds, thins the lowing kine, and treads The vineyards and the flax and flowery maize Beneath his feet. âWill CrÅsus deign to send âHis princely son and famous Lydian dogs âAnd hunters of renown, to free the land, âAnd leave his name all o'er the Mysian fields âFragrant as incense to the pastoral tribes?â To whom the King made answer: âSpeak no more âOf Atys; the new-married, as ye know, âHave got sweet labors of their own at home. âThe hounds and hunters ye are free to take, âAnd rid fair Mysia of the uncouth beast.â It grieved the heart of Atys; he was grieved That he should be shut out from manly toils, From winning love and walking in men's eyes A prince by deeds as well as royal birth. He came unto his father and knelt down, Knelt down before his father and his King, And sued with piteous words: âO royal Sire! âWith our progenitors it was esteemed âThat battlefield and hunting-ground should be âThe theatres of princes:âHath the law âBee changed in Lydia that thou shuttest me âFrom such employ? Father! what cowardice, âOr what faint spirit hast thou marked in me? âHow shall I come and go within the streets âOf this great Sardis, how endure the eyes âThat speak worse words than those men would address âUnto me if I were not prince? Dear Sire! âMy very bride will point me with her finger, âAnd call me âWoman,â wishing that she had âA man to be the father of her sons! âI pray thee let me go unto this hunt, âOr reason with me why I should not go.â CrÅsus was mindful of his bygone youth, Which was an echo to the young man's words. A teardrop stood within the proud King's eye; He was a father, and he wept and smiled. âO Atys, my son Atys, I have not, âThe gods forfend it! aught in thee observed âUnprincely, or beneath the graciousness âBorn to the sons of kings. I had a dream,â (And here a trembling passed upon the King) âA dream one night, when I had spent the day âAmid my treasures: I would not disturb âThe quiet happiness of thy young life âBy speaking of the vision, but I kept âThe burden at my heart, and there it lay âThe secret cause of my unwonted mien âAnd gesture; nay, in many little ways âIt hath unkinged me. Atys! it declared âThy span of life to be but brief: it spoke âOf death by weapon-point. Therefore it was âI hastened on thy nuptials, if so be âI might for my life-time enjoy thy life, âA theft, a stolen joy, the spoil of fate. âThou art my chosen son, nay art thou not âMine only one, thy brother being deaf, âNot one whom men could bow to as a king?â Young Atys listened, not without some awe, For he had piety towards the gods, And dreams and portents were unto his soul Its faith and fear, not wholly without love. O the sweet science of our youth, to find A way wherein our wills may go, a cause For action in the very reasonings Whereby men prove to us we should not act! Thus Atys spoke, the princely casuist, Pouring his honey in a father's ear:â âO father! blessÃ¨d art thou for the love âWherewith thou hast thus lovÃ¨d me! and yet âIts very fervor leadeth thee astray âFrom the true purport of the dream. 'Tis thus: âI am to die by point of iron spear. âFather, dear father! are the tusks of boars âIn that green Mysia made of iron points? âElsewhere they are of bone! Now art thou not, âDear father! art thou not a timorous king âAnd an unwise? Why truly I shall think âIt is my mother governs Lydia now, âSo good, so kind, and yet so timorous, âSo very full of sweet maternal wiles.â He shook his flaxen hair from off his brow, And looked and laughed into the old King's face: And the King laughed again at his rude boy, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired. CrÅsus! beware, the Dream is on thee now! But the Dream wrought; he let young Atys go: Fathers are evil pleaders with their sons. King CrÅsus sat within his audience hall, Silent and troubled, like a man who feels He hath done that which he shall one day rue. How cold, how weak the words of Atys seemed Now that the youth was gone; yea, he was gone, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired, Whose eloquence was his young face and not His reasonings, his light laugh and not his speech. For a sweet look and for a pretty gibe Atys, the flaxen-haired, was sold to fate. A daily bargain is it on the earth; Forsooth to-day a hundred sons have been To bondage sold in foolishness of love Which is not love, through weakness falling short. O father CrÅsusâyet it was the Dream. The Dream hath reached King CrÅsus. And behold! Where'er he turns dread Nemesis is there. Things turn to Nemesis beneath his touch. His servants are the slaves of fate: his guest Fate's shadow, and the sunbeam in the eye Of Atys is the light of fate; the shake Of his long flaxen hair belonged to fate. The royal house is compassed by a Power Which hath absorbed all wills into its own. Sorrow and mirth, the hour of kingly pride Within the treasure-house, the nuptial feast, The blood in Phrygia spilled, the mountain boar, The husbandmen, the fame of Lydian dogs, The kneeling boy, the gibe, the flaxen hair,â All grow into one shadow, and advance Upon King CrÅsus, like an angry god. King CrÅsus saw it not; he did not know He was become the centre of his Dream. Alas! King CrÅsus, we are all like thee, Fate teaching us the worship of free-will. King CrÅsus sat within the audience-hall, Silent and troubled: Atys had gone forth To make his preparations for the hunt. The monarch bade them call the Phrygian prince; Adrastus stood before him. âNoble guest!â King CrÅsus spake, âamid the royal state âWherewith thou seest me compassed, at my heart âA hot uneasy secret hath lain hid, âWhich threatens now to bring forth bitter fruit âOf dire affliction. I have cleansed thy hands, âAnd given thee kingly greeting, and a home, âAnd appanage, and all things met for thee, âAs though thou hadst been Atys, my true son. âNay, stranger, I recount not these small things âAs debts for which thou wert to pay me back âMeasure for measure; nor upbraidingly âAs though the kindness lay too light on thee. âI seek return most different in kind, âI would thou shouldst go forth unto this hunt. âThou art a gentle, princely man; I trow âAtys would be as safe beneath thy charge âAs though king CrÅsus went with him. The land âIs wild, and there are perils of the way; âHaply a father magnifies them, yet âI would that Atys went with thee, my guest! âAnd thou too hast great sires, unto whose deeds â'Twere well to link thine own; thy stalwart prime âWithout achievements should not thus elapse: âAdrastus! thou art born a Phrygian prince, âThe column of an old and generous name!â âMonarch and father!â thus Adrastus said, âI should not otherwise have sought this hunt. âA sorrow-stricken man should not essay âTo join himself unto his peers: the gods âHave taken him apart unto themselves, âClouding his days; nor have I now a soul âFor martial enterprise, or glorious deeds âOf princely prowess, isolated thus âFrom my long line of royal ancestors, âThro' exile, ay, thro' worse than exile dead. âYet for thy sake I go, content to have âThy joy for my reward in that sweet hour âWhen I shall give back Atys to thine arms.â King CrÅsus left the audience-hall assured. Ah! he hath drawn the Dream unto himself, And of his own free will embraced his fate. There is not now a fibre in his heart At which that Vision pulls not every hour. Methinks I see the glimmering plain outspread At sunny dawn, and Hermus flowing by, And the blue mountains, north and south and east, With Sypylus, which half fills up the west, Catching the sunrise, in whose rifted crags The thunder tolls all summer, day and night,â And the white walls of Sardis, and the king Waving his last farewell from near the gate. And o'er the Acropolis I see the snow On Tmolus, where the long-lived shepherds dwell, Tending their sable goats upon the downs With purple saffron streaked, while breezy morn Wafts o'er the plain from out the shrubby glens That aromatic breath so dear to Pan. And old Pactolus guides his lucid stream Between two lips of ruddy sand, which glow Like webs of golden tissue in the sun. Far off the tomb of Alyattes gleams Through the low mist, whose sluggish climbing folds Its lofty cone o'ertops, and shoots on high, Clearing its way into the radiant air. And in the wind the lake of Gyges seems Of silver shot with black, whose bright expanse Regions of plumy marsh-plants intersect, From out whose nodding coverts at that hour The countless swans rise up to greet the morn With tuneless pipings, which, with resonance Conjoined of insect-swarms that from the lake Keep off the thirsty herds, now only thrill That solitary shore of Lydian tombs. Then the brave band of men and dogs went on O'er hill and dale, and, when the sunbeams glanced Upon the spear-points of the horsemen there, It was the brightness of the Dream that moved With them to its fulfilment constantly. Atys, with beamy spear-points girdled round, Beguiled Adrastus somewhat of his woe, Recounting stories of the famous hunts, Which he had heard within the banquet hall By rhapsodists recited to the king From Lydian chronicles: and then he spoke Of his young bride, or bade Adrastus note The plumage of the bird that darted by, Or the thick fleets of rapid ortolans Which swam along the surface of the maize Or on a sudden sank and disappeared. He asked the name of this or that blue cone Which glimmered in the sun, or thoughtlessly He pointed to the dogs, and asked the prince If there were such in Phrygia, then confused He talked of other things scarce knowing what. Then languor seized him, and the weariness Of the tame distance, and they had some hours Of silent riding; but a bubbling brook, And hunter's fare and slumber in the shade Of single plane trees, such as here and there, Like tents, rise up in those unwoody parts, Refreshed the youth, and ever from his talk Adrastus gathered peace and freshness too. And thus they travelled to the Mysian border, In its green mountain glens to meet the Dream. How beautiful are still and starry nights On the great plains of Asia! And how clear The yellow moon in glossy-foliaged dells Where shrunken brooks are tinkling all the night! Oh I shall think unto my dying day How beautiful are nights on Asia's plains! The little tents, the smouldering fire of wood, The scattered arms, the horses on the plain,â Dim, dusky figures, feeding or at restâ What Atys and Adrastus saw is still Seen nightly in that old unchanging land. Amid the green and bosky roots, from which Mysian Olympus rises, there doth lurk A stony hollow, thickly overgrown With arbutus and straight lentiscus shoots And ragged stone-pines: there land-turtles dwell, And bright innocuous snakes, and cruel boars. And by the Mysian shepherds thither led After most blythe reception, Atys stood, And prince Adrastus and the Lydian band; And in the midst the boar at bay. The chace With all its wonted stirring circumstance Aroused the spirit of the Phrygian prince, And with the power of old past times relaxed Grief's pressure; and he hurled his lance With fierce unsteady eagerness, nor hit The raging boar: but youthful Atys fell. The brittle shoots of the lentiscus broke Beneath the fall, and to the naked sky The closing eyes of Atys were upturned. And in that stony hollow, which to-day The aromatic summer gently fills As calm as though no blood had been shed there, Was Atys, youthful Atys in his blood, Atys the beautiful, the flaxen-haired. There lay the hope of CrÅsus; thither came The old King's Dream for its accomplishment. There is a cry in Sardis; Hermus hears: 'Tis not the clamor of the nuptial feast,â Atys is dead, they wail for Atys. Where Art thou, young bride of Atys? And the Kingâ Where is King CrÅsus? Who will dare to say Unto the King that Atys hath been slain, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired? He who went out at dawn, who marked the birds, Whose youth ran over with him, like a well, And when his spirits wearied him, he slept Beneath the plane, because his heart was lightâ Who saw the stars at midnight in the sky, Who looked into that hollow and knew not It was his graveâhe is among the dead! O weep for Atys, Atys mid the dead! And Sardis wept for Atys. CrÅsus called For vengeance on Adrastus, called on Zeus The god of expiations: he assailed The powers of Heaven with clamorous prayers, and filled The streets with imprecations, such alone As agony could wring from out the heart Of a bereaved and stricken parent. âCurse, âO curse the impious stranger, god of hearths! âO curse Adrastus, thou dread power who reign'st âO'er mortal friendship! curse me that dark man!â Slow the procession moves along the streets Of twilight Sardis. See! the white form comes,â Atys, the prince, returning to his home. King CrÅsus gazed upon the murderer there, An apparition wan as the cold corpse Upon the swaying bier: King CrÅsus gazed, And he unprayed his curse, his passion sunk, Sunk down, and in his soul he pitied him; And beautiful and touching were his words, Albeit he then remembered with a pang How once Adrastus spake of the sweet hour When he should give back Atys to his arms: That hour had come;âit had no name in words! âStranger!â (for by that title he addressed The prince, scarce knowing whether it enhanced Or lessened his mishap, that it befel By stranger's hand) âI will not seek to add âBy word of mine to thine exceeding woe: âNay, rather I would bid thee take good heart, âAlthough environed by calamity. âAdrastus! it was God Who slew my son, âThe holy God Who warned me by the Dream. âAdrastus! it was God Who by thy hand âLaid Atys low, and quelled King CrÅsus' pride. âWretched Adrastus! be consoled for thisâ âIt was not thou, but God:âyet why by thee, âYea, wherefore by thy hand, most rightly dear âFor thy true princely heart, and for thy griefs?â Thus spoke King CrÅsus most benignant words: For his whole mind was raised and magnified, Made merciful and quiet as a god's, By the extremity of mortal woe. Oh what a royal heart had that old man! Sardis remembered many a long, long year The funeral of Atys; how the King Hung o'er the motionless white frame, and wept And wept and spoke not, how the thrilling wail Of the young bride resounded on the plain Throughout the dim expanse, and how the prince, The rapt Adrastus, spoke not, did not seem To hear or see, but was as if he strove With some dull baffling mist within his soul. All gazed upon Adrastus; yet no eye In the whole crowd of Sardians had a look Of rage or hatred; for the King's great soul Had passed into his people. Midnight came: The glowing light of the red pile sunk down. Hermus, who had been troubled with the glare Of nuptial lamps, and with the smoke and sparks Of the dull wine-quenched pyre, now calmly ran Past the low fresh-turfed barrow where the bones And ashes lay. There were no feet of men, No Sardian lingering from the mournful crowd, Around the grave; but night, calm night was there. The silent darkness rested on the plain, By the swift rushing river undisturbed. Adrastus stood beside the mound in thought, The prince, the gentle heart, twice stained with blood. He knew that there was suffering on the earth; But he, yea, he was singled out from men For awful woe, bent, laden, trampled down, A gazing-stock for all posterities, His being brought beneath some special law Of the invisible world, so marked and sealed That he should not claim kindred with mankind. Therefore he slew himself upon the grave; Not from despair, nor goaded by remorse, But, mastered by an instinct of deep love For earth and for his fellows, did he sit In judgment on himself, and, so condemned, With solemn self-collection did he slay Himself upon the barrow newly raised, That he might abrogate that fearful law Which had hung evil round him like a cloak. King CrÅsus mourned for Atys two whole years Within his latticed halls: his pride was spent; And from that cloud of sorrow he emerged, With heart and eye chastised, a royal sage; And with a melancholy gentleness Of thought and aspiration so endowed, Men marvelled at the wisdom then outpoured From lips which learned their sole philosophy From suffering: such transfiguration wrought The love of God within the pagan's soul: And such the working of a Heaven-sent dream To sanctify that ancient Lydian king. In early days I read this tale; it seemed Most touching and most wise, and it has lived Within my memory: in the simple Greek Of the old chronicler it truly is A stirring tale: perhaps less touching here, (Though English is a plaintive tongue) yet not Without pathetic wisdom of its kind.</field>
