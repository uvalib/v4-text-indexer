      <field name="fulltext">To my well affected, and no lesse respected Friend and Kinsman, Colonell Tho. Crompton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A FARDLE OF FANCIES, OR, A MEDLEY OF MUSICK, Stewed in three ounces of the Oyle of Epigrams. 1. The new Helicon. What's this advanceth our poetick strains, And breeds a sea of fancies in our brains? Frames us more high then fortune, and doth keep Our mindes contented in distresses deep? Is it the pimping water that doth flow From poetasters Helicon, or no? Is't the Pierian well? the font that uses To be attributed unto the Muses? Is that so lofty in each puny quill That's on the insteps of Parnassus hill? Pauh, name it not, it's odious; and I tell ye, Such liquor will breed chill-blains in the bellie, And pimples in the brains; and never clime Up to the feeble honour of a rime: Much lesse a Poem. But the only stream That turnes all horrid sorrowes to a dream Of paradise, and makes a Poet shine, Is Bacchus, bounded in a Pipe divine. Here's Helicon in hoops, which doth convince A Princes frown, and make a pleasant Prince. I told my friend this story, but he swore He nere knew Helicon had hoops before: But hee's a foolish Imp, and for his pains, I dig'd a whirl-pit in his greasie brains, And fill'd it with this liquor, which began To make him stand t'his armes like any man. Zounds, he began to swear. And swearing sayes, His bloud is up in armes, and he can raise A whole Brigade of thoughts, which will not doubt (If thought could do it) to give him the rout, That routed great Darius, or orecome The world with one poor finger and a thumb. He cals Apollo skip-jack; and abuses Cleio, Urania, yes, and all the Muses; Spits into Helicon, and then looks sower: Disclaims its vertue, and denies its power. He swears it poyson's Poetry. And then He scratches Pallas, till she bleed agen. And now he fals to swearing by the Lord, Hee'l run Parnassus thorough with the sword Of his invention. And hee'd have you know it Wine is the Helicon that makes a Poet. 2. Opportunity. I Why should I not dally (my Dear) in thine eye, and chace the dull hours away? He that lets such a fair opportunity flie, he loses, his aime by delay. And it's pity he ever should sip Electar and Nectar, that flowes from thy lip. II Upon thy fair tresses (which Phœbus excell) my diligent fingers I'le twist. O there's my desire for ever to dwell, and I hope thou wilt never resist. And ere and anon, &amp;c. III Upon thy fair breasts I'le be mounted aloft, and there in my charet I'le feel The grain of thy body, more precious and soft then the web of Arachne's wheel. And ere and anon, &amp;c. IV I'le wander abroad in thy veins; and Ile seek the mazes of pleasure and love. The garden of Venus it is in thy cheek, And thither my fancy shall move. And ere and anon, &amp;c. V There, upon the lillies and roses I'le light, And gather my sweets like the Bee. And I will not go far for a lodging at night, For surely the hive shall be thee. And ere and anon, &amp;c. VI Where, when I am hurl'd, my nest I will build, Of Hony-combs all in a rank. I'le buz in each corner untill it be fill'd, And make thee more full in the flank. And ere and anon, &amp;c. VII Come then with a Cornish let us combine. (I know thou canst easily doe't) Thou shalt take my heart, and I will take thine. And I'le give thee my hand to boot. And ere and anon I will sip Electar and Nectar that growes on thy lip. 3. To his Rivall. I And wherefore do thy darts arise To her sweet eyes? What though shee's fair? and others are Not of a magnitude so rare In vertue and in beauty? yet Me thinks to quell Those emulating thoughts, that swell Beyond thy reason, would be wit. II Tell me, what though her fame Has rais'd her name Above the crest of all the rest Of her own sex, and doth invest Her with desert of princely love? What's that to thee? Why shouldst thou swell with enmity? Or from the square of prudence move? III What though her face a copy were, More bright and clear Then all the theams and wanton dreams Of Poets in their am'rous streams? A president for future daies? Must thou therefore Repine at my successe? and roar 'Cause fate for me this lot did raise? IV Did she ere court thee with delight? Or lend least sight (By smiles) that she affected thee? Or would renounce her faith from me, And of thy presents be possest? The Gordian knot W'have ti'd by Hymen's leave, and lot: Then rob's not of loves interest. V Or were't not for that sponsal bond; She's not so fond To unbequeath her heart till death Shall (nolens volens) stop her breath. She alters not like nights and noons: Lais and she Were not of one triplicitie, Shee'l not change suiters with new Moons. VI Cease then t'importune. And withhold Thy showre of gold, Mock thou not Jove in lustfull love. In vain thou seekst the rock to move: Call home thy folly, and refrain; Or else who knowes But thou (in spight of fate) mayst lose Thy hopes, thy Charges, and thy pain. 4. The Irony to Phillis. Phillis, O Phillis, shall I raise Some lively sonnet in thy praise? Shall I confesse it is my duty, To vail my bonnet to thy beauty? And sacrifice to thee (alone) A Hecatomb, composed on Ten thousand scraps of rimes that be Scrap't from old ruin'd Poetry: Take wit at interest up, and use Some mercenary Jugling muse, That may uncase to you and me, Not what you are, but fain would be. And let her spend (at least) an age, To trim you ready for the stage Of faine, where you shall have progression Not for the truth, but the expression. Stifly affirming you more sweet and fair Then fresh Aurora, or the air In cloudy daies, and testifie How many lovers from your eye Took flame, and burnt both flesh and soules To ashes, or at least to coales. And justifie how many passe To you, as to the Corinth Lasse. And would not fear the infernal grove, So they might but enjoy your love; And warm their chiller spirits by The sun-shine of your sacred eye. With thousands more such words as these (The marrow of Hyperboles) Say, Shall I thus endevour? No This were t'applaud my mortall foe. 'Twas her false beauty, too too free, That like a tyrant martyr'd me. 5. Cruelty. Go little Archer, to another zone, And there display thy power: make it known To savage brutes, whose truculent desires Give ground to sury, and enhaunce the sires Of cruell onsets. Chaunt the wilder crew Of sensuall creatures, such as never knew One thought beneath a rigor. Go, and set The conquering pile on the Rhinoceret. Charm thou the Lion, and the Leopards fume: Refrain the subtle foxes with thy plume. This were a work of charity, an act Of meer necessity; and would be backt With popular applause. What though you can Not temper them with reason, as a man Is by divine instinction? yet you may Prohibit their distempers, and alay Their desperate madnesse: for we sadly prove No shackle so restringent is as love. Then fly away from me, and do not use Thy tyranny my freedome to abuse; Since it is needlesse. I was tame before, Needing no instigation to adore, Where duty bids. Go seek another shaft, That may divert the former: and and by craft, Reduce me to my reason, that doth lie Dazl'd and martyr'd by a virgins eye. O clasp those lids, and let my senses turn To their own vertue, or to coals I burn. 6. The cruel Boy. Nor Boreas blasts, nor Vulcans bellowes; Nor fortunes low, nor lofty fellowes; Nor outward care, nor inward sorrow, Nor newes of ill shall come to morrow, Could make my intellects more stupid, Then has the pregnant bow of Cupid. Proud Mars his lusty blowes will smart Not half so much as his small dart. He conquers all men by his quiver, And he himself is conquer'd never. And who would think a childe should doe Such noble feats? Consider too What aid he hath to hold the fort; They are but of the weaker sort. His Counter-scarps, half-moons, and trenches, Are manag'd all by wanton wenches; And yet they are not volunteers, For they must all be prest he swears: Yet sure if wisdome would but pause, In little time she'd finde the cause Why they so strong their turrets keep, 'Tis cause their trenches are so deep; So deep dame Nature did alot um, That never man could finde the bottome. Unlikely then that we should win, That sink so low at entring in. 7. A walk in a summer-morning. I July inviting in a morning sweet, (when fair Aurora plaid With golden Phœbus in a crimson sheet, Untill they were betraid) Florina (whom the gods applaud For beauty) went with me abroad. But Oh the blisses, the Seraphick blisses I found, to feed my soul, in her sweet kisses! II Such the perfections of Florina were, Such pleasure in her love, That every verdant Arbor did appear As mansions all above The Crystalline, where Jove attends To welcome all his Jovial friends. But Oh, &amp;c. III Bright were the heavens, and their houses swept: Virgo began to rise. Agnus a galliard danc't, and Hircus leapt, While Philomell defies The sleeping Bubo: every sweet, To blend loves harmony did meet. But Oh, &amp;c. IV When I had poysed every pleasant show, And summ'd up all in jest, I found the totall object too too low To entertain the guest. For if the Poets had her seen, Then deifi'd she should have been. But Oh the blisses, the Seraphick blisses, I found to feed my soul, in her sweet kisses. 8. Thalius and Clarena. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this poem as follows: For Tha. read Thalius For Clar. read Clarence Thalius. What new discurtesie has prest, To be Clarena's bosom guest? What policy has over-aw'd, (What th' publique eye did once applaud, And glory in) the chearfull beam Of thy curl'd brow? (loves copious theam). Clarena. Ah wofull wretch, distressed soul, Deluded maid, sweet Mars did roul My passing bell, for I have found With this with this destroying wound, I am already pierc't; and why Should I (poor heart!) whose constancy Is crost by love, and whose ill fate Sees her sad destiny too late Once think to live? or own the strife Of action, which assisteth life? Thalius. Sweet star, let fall thy influence, And learn me to unlock the sense Of thy invellop't words, let's see What in these Hieroglyphicks be. Display the emblemes of dark ire, And light my limped eyes with fire Of thy expression. [Clarena] Charon come, I'de fain be at Ellzium. I loath to live. I'le not indure My thought should feed on what's impure. Tha. Alas this this is no satisfaction: No antidote to my distraction. Some sullen fate has lately flown Into thy contentation, Whose tenure to thy Thalius show, That he may aid thee in thy woe. Clarena. Charon where's thy transporting boat? Ore Stygian waves I'de gladly float. Thalius be silent, let me die, And never ask the reason why. Tha. Charon keep back, and come not here To rob me of my dearest deer: Let not her absence me prevent, But let me know her discontent. Clarena. Imperfect soul, (whose painted mask Shrouds meer deceit) how canst thou ask The tenure of my toyle, when thou Procuredst it but even now? Thalius. Heaven aid my weaknesse, and declare In what respect my failings are. Could my Clarena sink as low As ere my basest thoughts did grow; She, in that depth should not discover The least of a deceiving lover. Clar. I but too sadly I am told How thou art brib'd by lust and gold, To violate thy vowes, and stain Thy fair pretences with foul gain. Thal. To th' gods I swear it is untrue, I never lov'd a she but you; Nor did I ere imbrace a she For lust or gold: gods what say ye? Clar. Report saies otherwise. [Tha.] Report, Is more uncertain then the Court. And will you build your faith upon Feeble Reports foundation? Heaven can witnesse I was never Shot by a dart from Cupid's quiver: Whose bow was not your brow, whose pile Was not your own subduing smile. Some sad assaults indeed have bin Acted by these whose loathsome sin Is impudence: and they, whose aime Is lesse interess'd then their fame: In goodnesse, flowing with more passion Then is receiv'd with acceptation. Such, such whose ill ambitions are To catch in their malicious snare, Those that are free; such as would shoot And batter down all good repute. Cause there might none unspotted be To rail at their iniquity. 'Tis true, by these I have been face't, And in a single sense disgrac't: But unto these I nere inclin'd, Nor gave the hostage of my minde. Nor did I think Clarena cou'd Have once suspected that my bloud Was so unworthy as to please, Or take impress from such as these. If I should once be lesse then thine, Alas I should be none of mine. Should I (in passion) once agree To play upon another shee, I should suppose my sin most great, And (like a Hermite) nere retreat To see thy face; but end my years In deserts, where no sign appears Of love, and beauty. Clarena, Speak thou thy self, thy self, and say, I know thou lov'dst me passing well: Thy fancy had no parallell. And where most love doth reign (we see) Thee alwaies is most jealousie; And where most jealousie's in fashion, There's most critick observation. Say then Clarena, thou, whose eyes Have peept in all my secrecies; And out of conscience, say if you Ere found what now report doth shew. Did not your self (with more intent Then they, whose words and complement Proceed from idlenesse, which drawes A large discourse from any cause) Inspect my life? yet never saw The smallest breach in Cupids law. Clarena. 'Tis true. [Tha.] O clear the heavens then, And let thy cheeks return agen To their first splendor. Call no more For Charon's boat to cast thee ore. But let's renew our faith, and so Wee'l finde Elizium ere we go, Placed in our loves. [Cla.] Pardon, I've done; I'le court thee with an orison. Pardon, O pardon, I confesse My own, my own unworthinesse. Tha. Can she unworthy be, whose face And vertuous temper, and whose grace, The glorious angels, nay yet higher, The gods (inrag'd with earnest fire) Wax warm by courting? I'le give ore, Thy pardon's seal'd, I'le say no more. Clarena. With kisses then, my own I'le cherish: Dumps get you gone; let sorrow perish. I'le live and love. Charon avoyd, More nobly are my thoughts imploy'd. Thalius is mine, and boast I may, That I am his true Clarena. 9. The Complaint. I Ah mee! I faint, I fall, I perish, Unlesse my Claria come and cherish My blew lips with a balmy kisse Sacred blisse, That recovers The infatuate souls of lovers. Come and feed Me at need. II Where art thou gone, th' art alwaies void, When thou shouldst be the best imploy'd. Empty, airy, easie, gentle-thing, Let us cling. 'Tis an action, Gives love-sick spirits satisfaction, And doth rout Pining doubt. II Come let us twinde, let's clip and close, And drink Nectarian juice, that flowes From the fresh riv'lets of thy lips; Where there skips Many a Cupid To revive a soul that's stupid. And relieve Us that grieve. 10. The Refusal. Nay do not urge thines eyes: no tear shall rear A recantation in my heart, No art Shall disresolve my fixed minde; Nor binde Me over to anothers will. I'le fill No fancies but my own, where love Doth move Me to solicite in this sute, I'le do't. Shall thy untempered tears recall, And thrall A heart that's free, to fry and tire In fire Of vexing fancy? No, I'le first Be curst With each pernicious and ill fate, But that, When I was first polluted in The sin Of serving thee, thou hadst no purse; Nay worse, Thou hadst not one poor spark of grace, Nor face That might intice me, no desert Thou wert Indow'd with. All thy breast within Was sin, Yet though thou hast no coyne nor grace, Nor face; And though thy sins are manifold, Untold: It is not this provokes my heart To part With thine; only my will (I vow) Sayes, Goe, Or otherwise I could have staid, And plaid The fool. I could dispend with all Those small Defects, and could have born what ere Was there Of sin too much, only I must Be just Unto my will, which has forsook Loves book; Then do not welter at my change, Think strange At no mischance. 'Tis the same cause Withdrawes My love as won it. Both my love and loathing Spring only hence, I love and loath for nothing. 11. The Check. Down ye aspiring thoughts, where would ye mount? What? would ye veil proud Atlas brow, or count The countlesse lights of heaven? Do you strive (With Polyphemus) to unthrone, and drive Great Jupiter from his imperial seat? Alas, alas, your power is not so great. Review your weaknesse, span your selves again, I am but dust and ashes; O refrain This frailty, and self-flattery, and see The inside of thine imbecillitie. I'm but a pondrous clod, and cannot rise Above the stage of earth, each thought that flies Higher then that, is haughty, and doth prance, And may (with its excelsity) advance My finall ruine. He that looks to sit Above his fellowes, deals with pride, not wit: His guide is Folly, and his friend a stranger; The Life-guard of his safety is but Danger. Then die conceits, and rest within the tombe Of earth, polluted earth, from whence ye come. 12. The Query. Say; Shall I love her? I, or no? Her that has left me wounded so, So wounded that I must indure An endlesse wound, a wound past cure; Past all the cure of physicks art, That art works nothing on a heart, A grieved heart, a heart that groans, That groans for love, whom love disowns: Whom love (for spite) did set on fire; Did set on fire, and then retire; Retire (like Nero) to some mont, And there in scorn did look upon't, Upon the heart she had betraid; Upon the flame that she had made. Oh, shall I still her eyes adore? Adore her eyes that have giv'n ore, Giv'n ore to heal me, or recruite My faintings, when one look would do't? Say, Shall I at her absence grieve? Or pin my love upon her sleeve? No, all's but passion, and there needs No such endevour, no such deeds. Then farewell love, thou restlesse guest, And lodge no longer in my breast. I'le walk no more in beauties light, Since 'tis more dangerous then night; Full of deceitfull Crannies: and Will scarcely let good tempers stand A day in peace. And hardly knowes (At best) how to pay half it owes, Our offered souls it takes in vain, And payes our favours with disdain. 13. The Wish. I O that I had by Gyges ring, Or Dædalus his well-flegd'd wing, Or Europ's Bull; or any thing II That would convey me to that Zone, Where my heart (imp't by love) is flown, And left me dying all alone. III Let speaking tears expresse my woes. Oh heartlesse man! Oh fortune! Oh! Love, bring my heart, or let me go, IV To fetch that tyrant's that possesses Mine in her bosome, and neer guesses The large extent of my distresses. V Yet since th' hast stoln (by thy sweet power) My heart, and keep'st it in thy tower. And leav'st me in despair to louer. VI I'le count such fortune but a bubble: And to revenge me of this trouble, I'le say thou hast a heart that's double. 14. The Petition. I O pity, pity him that fryes Upon the grid-irons of thine eyes. What greater plague could hell devise? II No Juniper has such a coal: No torture can torment a soul So bad as love when't doth controul. III The Sun growes warmer by my fire: And by my sighs the winds retire. My tears advance the Ocean higher. IV O turn, thou Antidote alone, And mollifie thy heart of stone, Before I perish flesh and bone. V Change thou thy Marble into mosse: And do not smell of Charing-crosse. To lose a hard heart is no losse. VI O cool me in thy shady grove: And from my senses quite remove The sulph'rous odour of a stove. VII Or else a tyrant thou wilt bee, That hast the heart to stand and see The wofull martyrdom of mee. VIII Of me, whose labour and endever, Was prone to be thy slave for ever, And to resist thy fancy never. IX Of me, whose solace, and whose rest Could not suppose it self more blest, Then when I thought thou lov'dst me best. X Of me, of me, and only me, That fanci'd once, I ne're could be Happy, but in thy companie. XI And now that thou shouldst be my bane, Retorting such reward again, Is grief too great for me t'explain. XII But since I must be thus withstood. And none may quench my boyling blood; My passion shall produce a flood. XIII A flood of tears shall flow so free, That they shall quench these flames in mee: And then I'le scorn thy Love, and thee. 15. A brave temper. I You lumps of the earth, will you never be wise? Go barter your plumbets for plumes, and arise. Your spirits you tire, like Dun in the mire. The gold and the silver that Fortune hath lent you, Hold your freedoms in chace, and disfigure the face; And in stead of a pleasure, are toyles that torment you II And these are the blessings your labours beget, Y'are clear of the Compters, yet ye are in debt; For sadly you finde you have prison'd your minde; And nothing can baile out your hearts from your purses. Besides you induce Panick fear, and abuse, Well riveted in by the poor, in their curses. III Now as for the Poets, they feel no such weight: What they gain in the morning, they spend at the night: And when they haue done, they lie down with the sun, Commending their bodies to heavens protection. And they fear not the thief that disturbs your relief; That keeps you awake, and your joyes in subjection. IV There's none wil break through our wals (we presume) To rifle our coffers, and ransack our room. We have no such things as Jewels and rings. No St? thief nor high-way man aims at our treasure. We do what we please, and our selves keep the keyes Of our own inlargement: and take's at our pleasure. V Each man is a Consull t'himself, and doth sit Sole Judge in the Courts of Canary and wit. We build not our hopes on the pardons of Popes. Our hearts they are clear, and we will not imbrue um With corruptible crimes, and errors of times, We never fall out about meum and tuum. VI While we in the lofts of our liquor do lie, The eyes Astronomy reach not so high; For then we have more of riches in store, Then they which have purchast Episcopal livings: With the lands, and the means of Chapters and Deans, Which now's their see-simple for only thanks-givings. 16. The Search. Out she's gone, and I will follow: Help me, help me good Apollo. Come Lucina, bring thy taper: Lusty Mars lend me thy rapier. I'le not stay for time nor danger; Nor be dasht by friend or stranger. Night and day I'le not be quiet; Nor receive my rest, nor diet, Till I finde What my minde Feeds upon. No frowning rigor, No fierce Wolf, nor furious Tyger Shall repeal me, or refrain me; No ingagement shall constrain me. No false pleasure shall me flatter; No tempestuous storm shall batter Down my fixed resolution; Nor affront my prosecution, Till my breath Fails by death. But who shall be my attendant, Presbyter or Independant? Pages, sure I need not any, Though I might be serv'd by many. With no rivall I will mingle; Love is best when it is single: Ergo I alone will wander, Till alone I understand her That doth sway Night and day My vext fancy. Oh but whither Shall I ramble to be with her? If among the gods I enter, There I shall not circumvent her. She's not so devoutly given, As to lodge her soul in heaven. She conceiv'd it not her duty To trust more to zeal then beauty. Nor could I Ere discry Any cause why she should do it, When I nicely look into it: Beauty (natures prize and potion) Got more profit then devotion. Is't not true then? judge you of it, We love that most yeelds most profit; Therefore I will never minde her In cœlestial orbs to finde her; It would be Hard for me: Yet perhaps she took her station In some apparent Constellation, Which, if sea-men did but know it, They would point their staffe unto it: And for observations, follow Her in stead of bright Apollo. If among the birds she gathers, She'l be noted by her feathers, Such as are Richly fair And will quite forsake loves fountains, For the sweet Arabian mountains, Where the Phenix lately burned, To whose nature she is turned. If with Pluto she abideth, And within those groves resideth; Then I am resolv'd to think it, That she is in every Pinket, That is seen On the green. But why are my thoughts extended To such breadth? she's comprehended On the surface of the centre Where earth's globe doth complement her. She's apparent in each flower, And therein displayes her power. Smell but on the sweetest posies: Look upon the blushing roses; There thine eye Shall discry Her, but 'tis too faint and weakly, And in them she looketh sickly. Th' are but types, and cannot shew her As she is, one half so pure. She is the prop of natures glory; Beauty far exceeding story, That may teach perfection better By her golden rule and letter. Such is she Sought by me. Now if any man discryes her, For loves sake let him surprise her; Let him take her by the finger, And to Cupid's palace bring her. And of her take twice two kisses, And hee'l need no greater blisses. 'Tis sufficient to requite all His endevours. So good night all You that know Lovers woe. 17. A Woman. I A Woman is a wanton thing, And only serves to dandle, A bow that bends without a string: A knife without a handle; For if thereon your hand you put, It's ten to one but you are cut. II A woman is a lighted taper, She burneth as she sings: Lovers (like flies) while there they vapour, They scorch away their wings; Then down they fall into her pit, And there they drown both joy and wit. III A woman for her constancy, I'le worship and adore: For she is bad, and she will be The same for evermore: Or if she change from doing ill, Be sure 'tis done against her will. IV A woman is a mysterie, The learned scan Whose bottom ne're could fathom'd be By all the art of man: And she is one that can adorn Her husbands forehead with a horn. V A woman's a Theorbo Lute, That's alwaies set in tune: And if you put your pen unto't From mid-night untill noon; Yet shee'l be loath to let you go, Because she loves the musick so. VI A woman is a Hartichoak; Whose leaves are only good: Her pleasant outside doth provoak Our veins and vernall bloud; But if you touch her to the core, It's ten to one you finde a wh?re. 18. Disdain. Is this Loves court of Conscience, to infer So many darts on one poor sufferer? No triple Gerion, or fierce Hydra found So many heads, so many stings to wound The Trojan Prince unfortunate. There flies Not half so many beamlings from the eyes Of well-stor'd Argus, as my wanton foe Hath unlaborious projects to orethrow. O you unworthy Nature, for your tricks, I'me bound to curse you: you that love to mix A pride with beauty, you that interlace A curst condition with a comly face; That make such active engines, to surprise Your friends, and make them suffer sacrifice. You that are fair without, but all within Foul with ambition, that contains a gin, First ticing in idolatry to erre, And then to prize on the Idolater. When first this Circe had my senses charm'd I mounted Cap a pee, most stoutly arm'd T'oppose the adversary, and orethrow His wanton fury, but he brings his bow Unto her hand, and bids her to be sure She shoot at such a heart, and stand secure. Then in a fury, she began to throw Her witchcrafts to increase my former woe. A scornful smile upon me then she threw, And seconds it with a quick pish or two. So spritefully upon me she did fall You'd think her body were a soul and all. More subtle was she to inlarge my grief Then Cacus, or Proverbeus (that brave thief) To gain cœlestial fire. Shee increases Her doubled blushes, and sets out her tresses; Makes every burnisht hair upon her browes, A mortall shaft to slay me, but allowes No thought of love, no fancy, nor desire T'allay the fervour, and asswage the fire Her beauty kindled. But (disdaining high) Displayes a brighter banner to my eye, As who should say, Thou fondling, if I can, I'le triumph in thy misery (poor man!) But hang't, I care not, I will act a part With resolution; since I finde my heart, The more it hovers, and with care implores, The more it's wounded with disdainfull sores. I'le call my fancy home, and bid her rest Within the private Cottage of my brest, And I will be its nurse, and care no more For beauty, then she car'd for me before. 19. Commendation. I My Mistresse is fair, my Mistresse is rare; Her beauty's a marchlesse treasure, In every part, for nature and art, Fair Venus her self doth measure. And upon my soul she has not the mole That on dame Venus cheek did grow; Her beauty no blot doth know. II Fair Helen of Greece, that Amorous piece, That pleasant and notable sinner, Although such a floud of rational bloud Was spilt by her rivals to win her; Yet could she not be so lovely as she, Whom fortune hath elected forth, To conquer me by her worth. III So neatly she moves, so swiftly she loves; Her glance is enough to ravish. Her sanctifi'd eye shines moderately; 'Tis neither too close, nor lavish: Her smile (if she please) can cure each disease Where profound Empericks may fail, Her courtesie can prevail. IV An armfull of blisse, so sacred as this, Jove never composed nor courted; With angels so bright, and full of delight, The poetick pens never sported. Don Quixot would be in combate with me, Did his quick knowledge but discry My fancy had flown so high. V Come then my fair Gem, and value not them That can not indure to be quiet. In mine armes be thou hurl'd while the troublesome world makes war and rebellion its diet; And then my desire shall ramble no higher: My heart from care I will set free; Thy love is enough for me. 20. A Letter sent into the Countrey. Friend, I give an answer, as it is my duty; Because ye wrote to know of Grizels beauty. O Monstrous! Beauty I to thee petition, Thou art more wondrous then an Apparition: More bright then scoured Andirons, and more clear Then new Stepony; and as brown as Beer. Thou art as blew as starch in every vein; Enough to make a Monkey break his chain. Her hair (wherein my tangled heart doth lie) Shines far more bright then whip cord to mine eye: Her breath's a Champion, for it's mighty strong; Her eye-brow hair is nigh three inches long. Her eyes, (I vow, I almost had forgot um) Are broader then a sawcer at the bottom: Her nose (that Gem which nature did allow) Stands jetting, like the coulter of a plow: Thy lips (alas too light a word to show Their heavy worth) like dri'd bull-pizles grow Both round and riv'led: furrow'd deep (together) As blew as Azure, and as tough as leather. But shall I speak a word unto her mouth? It goes from pole to pole, from north to south, Incompassing a cell, that's full as deep As th' Devils arse of Peak; where they that peep For bottom, lose their labour; and are fain To come away (repenting) back again, Her teeth (those bead-rowes that so much have grac'd her) Are not of Ivoury, nor of Alabaster: Hast thou ere seen a mouse-trap, that is made With steel indented? (art thou not afraid To hear the dreadfull rapture?) such they be, But are not set with such equality. Park-pales they do resemble. (Help, O heaven!) My fainting Muse, when theams are so uneven. Help good Apollo, raise me ten notes higher. Send down Urania: or do thou inspire Me with the dregs of Poetry, and sense, Let me not write with vulgar eloquence, On pieces so imperfect, where doth lie In every wrinkled fold, some mystery.) Oh the majestick visard of her chin, That bears her chops away through thick and thin. Bobtail'd thou art, contex'd like a knot, Th' art just like something, but I know not what: Thy cheeks fall back, as though for some ill cause, Thou went'st to hide them safe, between thy jawes. Thy neck shall not be placed in our rime, We'l keep the neck-verse till another time. But Oh thy back, thy shoulders and thy wast, Thy bouncing buttocks, and thy thighes, ore-cast With Canopies of Canvase, and of Sarge, I'le not speak much of them, they are too large For ten-feet verses: But I've seen them stand Like great Colossus in another land. Her inner part's so holy, that I dare Not own so proud a thought as t'enter there; Lest I blaspheme the Idol; and become, For that offence, barr'd from Elizium. Thus I, in part, have told you what I know, Of things above, and things that are below: And for what's wanting, I must needs refer Unto the next return o'th Carrier. 21. The invitation to walk. Clarena, Come and let's repair Into the fields to take the air. And in what place so ere we come, Thy presence makes Elizium. Let rurall swains adore thy fame; And Courtiers comment on thy name: And let the world thy beauty see, That Poets may eternize thee. Step out with me to yonder bower, And there we'l pluck the fairest flower: And when w'have done, we'l view, and see, Which is the fairest, it or thee: See'st thou those blossom'd trees (that shine With common glory, not with thine, With thine that did receive a glose Beyond the lustre of a rose, From heavens bounty) how they wait To wanton in their happy fate Of thy sweet presence? where in passion Of love, and joy, and emulation, They may conspire themselves, and see Their own despis'd deformity. Invade Priapus, see his leeks, And set thy lustre on his cheeks. And he no sooner will espie The heavenly tulip of thine eye, But in a passion he will run (As Owles avoid the light of sun) Into a corner, and will powr Down tears more lavish then a show'r, To see himself exceeded so, And must become a theam below Anothers worth. Me thinks I see The bushes becken unto thee. The dewy morn has shed a tear, Because she wants thy presence there. Then prethee let's go to the plain, Or else let's go to bed again. 22. A Mole on Celia's Cheek. I What's that (fair Celia) doth presume To th' mansion of (that heavenly room) Thy cheek? Doth beauty bud or bloom? II Or else did Nature place it there, In emulation, and for fear Thou shouldst above her self appear? III And so she thought (as well she might) She were not th' author of so bright A Gem, as on thy cheeks did light. IV Or were it by a power divine? That so that lively face of thine, Might not without a blemish shine. V Nor might appear beyond the Moon, Which is for earth too high a boon; For nothing's perfect that's sublune. VI And so each Idolizing eye (That in so bright a Zone doth lie) Should take thee for a Deity. VII On this account't might haply be, For goddesses do strive (we see) In beauty for priority. VIII Yet how so ere it came, I wot, It serves her for a beauty spot, And to her splendor is no blot. IX Venus had one, or else I dare, Be so audacious as to swear, Sh' had nere been counted half so fair. X 'Tis poverty that plenty prizes; The worth of health by sicknesse rises; And beautie's better'd by disguises. XI White, with black spots, doth whiter show; And she no woman is (I trow) That has not one, 'bove or below. 23. The Bitter-Sweeting. I Saw you Aurora, in her morning dresse, Ere sable clouds approach Her burnisht tresses to oppresse, And vail her crimson Coach? So fair, and fairer Claria shines, Whose heavenly glance injoynes All eyes that view her, To praise her and persue her. II Ah! but thou serpent of infernall breed, Ambition, that do'st rest With restlesse actions, and dost feed Within so fair a breast. Thou spoyl'st the glory of this star, With thy deforming scar: Th' hast blurr'd her rayes, Like spotted Cynthia's. III Has never fame created in thine ears Pallas her pregnant wit? Tush, tush, my Claria's fancy rears More lively works then it, Whence Poets must their phrases draw And Satyrs stand in aw; And dare not louer Against so strange a power. IV Ah! but thou seed of pestilential race, Incontinency, sprung From Pluto's Cave, or some such place, My Claria thou dost wrong: Poysnest the prudence of her brain With infamy, and stain; And gainest more Hate, then wit gain'd love before. V And now my Claria, for so clear a beauty, And wit so pure and free, I must imbrace it as my duty To love and honour thee: Yet from those vices that arise, I've learned to despise A thing that's foul, With all, with all my soul. 24. The Cheat. I. Once I did love, and loved true, Ah! but it prov'd in vain. Claria, I fell in love with you, You vow'd to love, and more you said, Your love should be divine. What prank soever fortune plaid, Yet still you would be mine. II. This re-inforc't my new born zeal, And did ingage me more Loves charming blisses to reveal, Then ere I durst before. I fetcht expressions lovers use To court their Ladies by, From Helicon; and every Muse Claria did deifie. III. With Indian pearl, and gifts the best Of nature and of art, I fed this love, and with the rest I gave my wounded heart; And then I thought thou hadst been mine, No reason urg'd my doubt, My fate was rich, my joyes divine, With blessings wall'd about. IV. Because she did my presents take, And own me as her own, I little thought she would forsake him she had pitcht upon: I thriv'd in Confidence; and said, Fortune had chose for me The prettiest and the wittiest maid That ever eyes did see. V. But when I had conceived so, Then I was most deceiv'd: Oh little, little did I know Of thee I was bereav'd. Cœlestial beauty! How couldst thou Commit so foul a fact, As to infringe a sacred vow With ceremony backt? VI. Unconstant fate, unconstant love; Unconstant Lady too. I'le scorn you all, and will remove My love away from you. And since unblemisht love must be rewarded in such sort, Henceforth I'le fix my love on thee But for an hours sport. 25. The Catch. I Come to the brim (boy) fill our bouls, 'Tis wine new vamps our heart: And sets a glosse upon our souls Beyond the power of Art. II 'Tis wine that drowns corrupting woes; And Fortunes fury quenches: The poor man whilest in sack he flowes, He feels no want but Wenches. 26. The Weather-cock. I Z'Life I reach my sword, for in my rage, In thousand bits I'le slash The Gnaiko's that defile our age, And break their bones to mash. Those that will turn Ere they will burn, And flink at every slash. II Those that their Prince and Peers adore For interest of their own: Those, when their fortunes are blown ore, Will vanish, and are gone. And basely will, Like swallowes, still Seek out the warmest Zone. III Those that have learned to divide Their hearts and tongues in two; That will a bet on either side, Serve both the false and true. And you that can Praise every man That keeps a bribe for you. VI If Cæsar daign to smile on such, No paradise so sweet: But if he frowns and frowneth much, Their fortune's under feet; And then their bliss And pleasure is Lapt in a winding sheet. V If Cæsar prayes to Mahomes, Then thou wilt be a Turk; Or if Popes pardons he will get, Thou'lt do the self-fame work. Thus doth thy zeal To his appeal, And in his lap doth lurk. IV Shall Cæsars frown, or Cæsars smile Ring change in my devotion? Or shall I pawn my faith a while To amplifie my potion? No, no I hate To wheel with fate, Or move with every motion. VII Poor is his saith, and poor his friend, And poorer his renown, Whose joy and sorrow must depend On Cæsars smile or frown. Such fabricks stand On sliding sand, And soon are tumbled down. VIII 'Tis you professe Religion right; And hate to hear of evill; Yet in the darkest caves you'l light A candle to the Devill. 'Tis you whose paint Sets forth a Saint. Yet you are most uncivill. IX 'Tis you that act a double Scene; Ye seem to be profound, To this or that side ye will lean, And stand on any ground. 'Tis you (I swear) That run with th' hare; And follow with the hound. X My resolution is a rock Of steel, and doth disdain To yeeld unto the proudest knock, Inchantments are in vain. I'le never prove To fall in love For fear or filthy gain. 27. The Upstart. Why should I humour every critick fool, Whose law's his will, whose ignorance his rule; Whose prying censure seldome keeps at home; Whose tongue talks only of great things to come; Whose heart forgets his undo, and looks higher Then the low fabricks of desert aspire: Whose arrogancy does abhorre the newes Of quondam poverty, and does refuse To honour those, who formerly did blesse Him with old suits, and cloath his nakednesse For pities sake. 'Cause now by fate he's risen, And hoyst upon a Cock-horse from a prison: Shall he therefore that once was so absurd, Now think to claim acquaintance with the bird Of worthy Jove? or shall my breath applaud him? For by respect of lucre, shall I laud him? No, let him perish with his pride, and fall. The Devil give him reverence, and all His damned crew, for they have reason for't Cause he is Vice-roy of their sable Court: 'Tis not th' extention of his new swoln fate That shall allure me to lick up the bait. Nor yet the fury of his pride and passion Shall ere unhasp my temper from its station. Do what he can, yet I on no condition, Will be a servant unto his ambition. Though he's incourag'd by an ample fee Of nimble Fortune, and has outrun mee That had the best on't once, yet I will swim Through every plague before I'le creep to him. Not that I murmur at his good successe, But laugh and scorn at his unworthinesse. He that has chang'd his fleece, and now thinks fit, By changing of his flesh to better it. He's the true object of the purest hate That alters his conditions with estate. 28. The Declaration. I Clara, th' art absolutely wise: Clara, th' art fair and fine, And thou wouldst perfect all my joyes If thou wouldst but be mine. In truth I love thee with my heart, Though others tell thee so; And say thy love shall nere depart, Yet still thou seest they go. II O trust them not, they'l work thy woe; Their love is all in tongue Their fiery zeal at first doth show It will not tarry long. Their love's attended with a curse, 'Tis barb'rous and injust; They only love thee for thy purse; Or else their love is lust. III They promise Joyntures fair and good, Their hearts will be thy debter: All this is 'cause th' have understood Thy fortune is the better, Is better then their own, (they know) And hence it is they more thee; But my affection is not so, It is for love I love thee. IV Wert thou as poor as ere was girl, Yet I abhorre to halt; For in mine eyes thou art a pearl, And so thou ever shalt. I love those jewels in thy brest, Thy vertue and thy wit. And all the gods shall me attest, I only love for it. 29. To her Friend. 'Tis not with haughty malice I aspire To court your sense: nor arm'd with Cupid's fire. No wanton philtre does inforce my quill, The sacred orbs of your blest ears to fill. I'm no rejected Echo, who to gain Narcissus favour, takes a world of pain, Divides the winde, the brambles, and the briers; Hoping to kindle his untempered fires. I mean not thus: 'tis reason doth invade, 'Tis she that acts, and she that would perswade, She (mov'd with friendship) bids me, if I may, Unveil your eyes, and drive those mists away, That shroud the genius of your soul, and draw Your frantick fancie to another law, Then that of reason: tainted and unjust, Created not of honesty, but lust. What can you see of vertue, or of art In her you love, that may exact your heart To yeeld obedience to her frowns and smiles? She's all deceit, and where she comes, beguiles. Is it her beauty only, that doth move Thy cogitations to the flames of love? Shall that frail Gem (when haply it may be But counterfeited out by subtilty) Be rank't among the vertues? and be thought Worthy with souls destruction to be bought? What purblinde? what misconceived good Wich-holds the nobler practice of thy bloud? Has Circe charm'd you? and will you but please To judge the Mine by the Superficies? Search home, and see if her alluring skin, Can smother the deformities within. This done, you'l finde (poor soul) she doth impart Nothing that's counted rich, but undesert. Then curb thy sallies, and thy self inspect. Survey these ample errors; and correct Them by discretion, purge thy putrid brain From this corruption; then begin again. With this quaint Siren do not thou be charm'd, Pity, good nature were no better arm'd With prudent weapons, that they might improve Their worthier fortunes in the wars of love. Call back thy forces, lay thy siege no more Against a garrison that's won before: Poor prize, it renders triumph unto no man. It's won with too much ease: it's too too common, Therefore refuse to storm it, and retire If thou intendest to be honour'd by her Who is thine in all friendship. 30. Chance. I What's my offences that my fortunes be Inshrined in the tomb of poverty? But dust I am, from dust I came; And unto dust return I must; And he whom fate doth blesse With health, and wealth, and worthinesse, Is nothing more: and he must do no lesse. II Man, in the noontide of his glorie's but A lump of Clay, where a quick soul is put. All this you know, he is but so; And he that can but say he's man, Though fame and fortune say He's Prince or Pope, yet here I may Presume to match with him: we both are clay. III O me! How comes it then to passe that he Whose corps were gendred in the dirt with me, Should rise so high? and I, poor I Should fall so low as now I do? Is't art? no, that's not it, Our knowledge no such thoughts admit; 'Cause some mens worship are beyond their wit. IV 'Tis neither art nor desert that doth bring This man to be a begger, that a King. No vertuous hearts, nor morall parts: But that which still drives up the hill, And daily doth inhaunce Mans greatnesse, and his worth advance, Can be no other then auspicious chance. V Since then by chance we either fall or stand, And fortune playes with such a partial hand; No heart of mine shall ere repine: Nor will I guesse unworthinesse The more in me to rest, Though I conceive I am not blest With Princely honours, or a golden Chest. 31. A tear over Orania's Tomb. I Oh let me weep, weep out mine eyes Upon the Tomb-stone where she lies Embalmed and enshrin'd. Let not my senses lead me home, And leave Orania in the tombe. Why should I stay behinde? II What hope have I of life or blisse, Under so dire a fate as this? What's man without a heart? There was but one 'twixt she and me, And that away from me did flee, When hence she did depart. III And though the life of sense I kept, 'Twere better in the urn I slept; For sleeping there, I rest. And then my heart and I should be Fomented in tranquillity; And both for ever blest. 32. A voyage to the Canaries; or the Sack-pilgrimage. I Farewell false pleasures, vain delights; Deluding stories, and bewitching glories. Farewell false measures and false weights; Farewell false glosses and false lights: Farewell you Tory-rories; But welcome Sack; for I will be Ingaged unto none but thee. II Farewell you streamed cheeks of ore; You rich attires, and you vain love-sick fires: The world's a witch; beauty's a whore; Curst may he be that loves it more, Or to its vein aspires, My youthfull rivals I resign, And now go pilgrim to the Vine. III Farewell you Castles, Towns, and Towers: Farewell relations; and fare ye well fond fashion You morall rights, and formal powers, Wherein I've wasted many howers, Be gone away in passion; No aid at all from you I lack, In this my pilgrimage of Sack. IV Aureous and argent Mines avoid: Be gone ye rubies, and also you great boobie, In this your privie search imploy'd. Blinder then Cupid may the guide, That still directeth you, be. What mettle, earthly or divine, Is not ingendered by the Wine? V Cuckolds farewell, and Cuckolds Curres: Farewell trunk-breeches, and fare ye well long speeches; Farewell you Lords, Dukes, Knights, and Sirs: Farewell you dalliance and demurres, Farewell you oaks and beeches. I neither value man nor tree, But such as in the Vineyard bee. VI Farewell Kings, Princes, Lords, Popes: Farewell false Latins, farewell deluded Satins: Halters I'le change for Cable-ropes; Imbracing Stars and Horoscopes. Farewell high heels and pattins. Let no dull actor shame the stage; The scene is a Sack-pilgrimage. 33. The Retreat. I Tell me Tyresias, was it thou Bewitch'd me unto Cupids bow? Why should I hold this Deer in chace? Or wrack my fancy on her face? What hope is there to win the prize That still refuses and denies? II With weary labours night and day, Early and late, through clods and clay, In health and sicknesse, blisse and bale I wo'd her, but't would not prevail. My time, my coyn and spirits too I spent, but yet all would not do. III I manacled each strugling thought, And my aspiring soul I brought Into subjection; and did spill Full seas of tears to gain her will: All this I did, and more; but yet Her marble heart would not submit. IV Therefore I will decline the suit, And pluck up fancy by the root. I'le bid my stragling heart go home, And leave thee to the next that come. But may I perish for my pain, If ere I cringe to thee again. 34. Deformity. Give me the Maul of Hercules; the triple Head of stern Cerberus: and (thou Disciple) Grim Gueryon come, and bring thy furies here. Up Hydra, up: Parcæ, do you appear; Call up the damn'd deformities, and chace Each rosie and each purple from the place. Bring not loves arrowes, nor th' Idalian dart, To gall my senses, or love-wound my heart: But help, Oh help, I am beset about With snakie-hair'd Medusa, and I doubt I shall be frantick: Heaven grant me aid To back my weaknesse, or I am betraid. Blesse me! What eyes be these? what flaming sawcers? What speech is this, more rustical then Chaucers? What Tytian lump is here? what form? what fashion? What monster in my breast would make invasion? Jove shield me from't, and for succession-sake, (With sinfull Ixion) let me not mistake A cloud for Juno, lest my heirs should be Exceeding Contaurs in deformity. Shield me, good Venus, from this ugly ghost. Else I am ruin'd, and for ever lost, Yet, if by force I must be thrown upon her, (To save my reputation and my honour) I will imbrace her with a formall shew Of affectation: but (believe it you) Those nuptial duties which from me should flow, Shall be performed by I care not who. Let Incubus the Night-Mare be her mate, Or he that loves to wallow in such fate: But if no devil, nor no man will do't For love, her lovely gold shall presse them to't. They shall be mercenary, I'le not scorn With her own dowry to exalt my horn: Although her body be deform'd, and foul, Her gold is fair, and may delight a soul. Who then but fools (whom nature hath control'd) Would not incurre the horn, to gripe the gold? 35. The true beauty. I Tempt not my thoughts with powder'd hair, With Sattin, or with Lawn. This cannot make a Lady fair, Whose honour lies at pawn. Bring not thy jewels unto me, I neither value them nor thee. II Look not so high though fortune please Fairly to set thee forth; Thy own ambition's thy disease, And bridle of thy worth; Thy beautie's blur'd, thy fame destroy'd, Thy honour's strangled in thy pride. III 'Tis she that's fair, and only she, Whose minde does not advance With fate, above her pedigree; That glories not in chance. Whose beauty has more brightly shone To others senses then her own. IV Such is my Claria, she that holds My heart within her brest: Whose parallel, in Cupid's folds, Or flocks, did never rest. She whose ambitious smoke doth smother, Aspiring not above another. V She whose own merits might transport Her love beyond my case; Is humbly pleas'd my flames to court, And offerings to imbrace. With me she'l laugh, with me she'l sing, With me she will do any thing. VI She knowes no scorn, she'l not deny Her lips at my request. She nere saw me in misery, But she would be opprest. Therefore my Claria, only thou Must rule my soul and fortunes now. 36. Sept. 1655. The downfal of the black-Boy, and the white Girle in Budge-row. I Come lend a heart-destroying tear, A sigh, a sob, a groan; You Black-boy lads, that lately were More radiant then the Sun, You that did use to crown your pates With Beer and Ale divine, Come now, and curse your clouded fates, As I have cursed mine. II You sons of Cyptia, that were wont There to maintain your games; That were devoted to the font Where pleasure flowes and flames; Come mourn with me, and sadly cry, The Black-boy is a going: Which needs must be (infallibly) To our eternall ruin. III Ring out our sisters passing-bell; And let your tears increase: Spin out your daies in some dark Cell, Where sorrow nere may cease. What will you doe? where will you rest? And where will you repose? Where will you finde so fair a nest, Where love and beauty growes? IV There, when my money all was spent; I went upon the score; But now alas I must lament, I shall do so no more. Sweet Nan (whose soul and vertues are For Princely thoughts a shrine) O how unblest thy neighbours are In this sad change of thine! V Why would you leave us? What distaste Did harbour in your minde? How came your fancy over-cast? Why were you so inclin'd? The Black-boyes oyl no more will flow, His Cruce is all exhaust: And he that there to drink doth go, His labour will be lost. VI The black Boy, and the white Girl, both Have lost their powers there: Which story to unfold I'm loath; Nor can without a tear. Yet though Budge-row they have forsook, And left that throne behinde them, All you that please for them to look, In Abchurch-lane may finde them. 37. The Soliloquie. I Oh let me die; and to Elizium goe. Let me not languish in my woe. What glorie's here That's permanent, or dear? That may inchant a soul (with reason blest) To tarry in't, or take one minutes rest. II Love is forgotten; and the world is grown Like to the Smirnian Actor, who ('tis known) When Heaven's name O'th' stage he did proclaime, Would paint his finger on the earth: and there Seem to set his affections, as it were. III Society, the darling of delight, That turned bale to blisse, made day of night, Is quite destroy'd By avarice and pride. Whereas our vertues had extent before, Now each regards his own worth, and no more. IV Oh let me then lay down my vernall head Upon those groves prepared for the dead. Good heaven grant To death a Pursivant; That he may bring me to the Stygian shore, Where Charon with his boat may waft me ore. V There shall I see my Doroclea's brow: Which sight I've lost, which losse brought me so low: She, whose fair eyes Might be a Princely prize. She that lov'd true, and to maintain her vow, Was forc't to fly unto those fields below. VI There shall I see her, there shall I enjoy her; There will the gods give me a mansion by her; Where with sweet kisses, Smilings, and sweeter blisses, We'l feast: and there (in spight of fate and foe) We'l do those Orgies here we left to doe. VII There shall I see my brethren and my sires, That warm'd my fancy with Pierian fires, That found my Muse With buskin'd hose and shooes; And such a spirit on my genius hurl'd, That, for a minde free, I could change the world. VIII There Ben would bid me welcome, and his mares, Whose fruitfull brains, and whose ingenious pates, I've crown'd with bayes Of Sack, in former dayes. I was their Ganymede, and they would be As jovial as a Jupiter to me. IX There should I reign, and bid a rush for Kings, Popes, Lords and Princes, or such mighty things. All high descents, Grim looks, or Parliaments. All care to gain, or fear to lose estates; Guns, Pikes, or Pistols; Swords, or Counter-gates. 38. The Gender. Why should her beauty thus inchant Poor me her wofull supplicant? Why do I follow with a tear, Her various steps? is she more dear Then others are? What though she's cri'd Up to be natures only pride. That is no solid cause to summon A choice affection, while she's common. 'Tis true, she is both young and tender; And she is of the female gender. Were she but so, it would be well; But more then this, she doth excell: For if the thing discussed bee, She's common both to two and three; Or if to number we must fall; You'l finde she's common unto all. 39. To the Nymph. I Come, leave this dull retired life, And now assume the name of wife Ere it be more then time. Why should that flower fall alone That might be pull'd by every one? its glorie's now in prime. II Hold not your beauty in suspence; But in loves Innes of Courts commence To be a Student fair, With him that is resolv'd to be Your unrelenting Votary, While he is mov'd with air. III Why startle you from man so much? Despising him, whose every touch Is th' author of your blisses? Why will you unto him allow A sullen and tempestuous brow? And formalize your kisses? IV 'Tis man you ought to look upon As th' end of your perfection; But if you die in scorn, Your urn, your issue doth compose Heaven's abus'd: and you must lose The end for which y' are born. 40. Her Reply. I Yes, I could follow Cupid's tents; But when I see such presidents Of woe ingendered there, I check my fancies, and recall My looser resolutions all, And fleck my flames with fear. II What shall poor tempted Ladies doe? Into whose bosomes shall they throw The Lotteries of their love? When every moment we may see How unresolv'd their servants bee; And how awry they move. III Their fat professions are most free: Phrases flow fast, of constancy, Expression doth excell. Now their swift fancy flies as high As Titan in the towring skie; Then sinks as low as hell. IV Bright as the taper of the night, At first they do extend their light: Exposing love enough. And then become ere they have done, More odious then comparison: Their exit makes a snuffe. V Give me the solid Lover then, That goes away and comes agen; And breaks no sponsal vow: That's not by every smile ore-thrown, Nor dasht aside by every frown, Nor answers every bow. VI If such invite me with his flame, With equall heat I'le meet the same Through every case and state, To him my bosome I'le unlace; His love and him I will imbrace In spite of foe or fate. 41. The Club. Come my hearts and alter Cases, Burnish all with Sack your faces. Light the world with copper Noses, Redder then the damask roses: Or the torch held out by Hero. Strike up voices: sing Fa-lero, Since our lives can not be ever, Short and sweet delights the liver. Yesterday is past returning, Quench your spirits from worldly burning: Pine you not away with sorrow, Nor be carefull for to morrow: Let your zealots take up quarters In their Abbies, and their Dorters. We'l drive out the drousie summers With renowned cups and rummers; Shun Physitians, and their stories, And despise their Purgatories. Let Galon say what he pleases, Sack will sink down all diseases: Colick, Dropsie, Teeth or Ptisick; There's no such approved physick. This is that the gods affected; And for their own use selected. This is that sets anguish flying, Cheers the heart that lies a dying: Rinces nature from distemper; Invests each man in an empire. Bids the Taylor draw his dagger, And the slow-tongu'd Changeling swagger. Here's the cream of the Creation; Here's the habit most in fashion. Foolish glory's but a bubble; Riches may consume as stubble: Hang the world, and save the Liquor; Play about, and booz it quicker: Here's a health to him that's loyall To the cup, and stands the triall Of a vine-disburthening showre, And makes Wine his only dowre. That's not with new follies lur'd But drink healths to'th quondam St? 42. The Stand. I Undone, Alas, undone, My will my wisdome hath outrun, My roving soul hath vainly wrought A hainous crime, a grievous fau't, In seeking where my folly sought. II False zeal, how can it be That fortune ere should favour thee? When to good fortune thou hast been Unfavourable, what a sin And sorrow, art thou plunged in? The Return. I The weary footman having past Ore many a hill, and many a dale: Through many a storm and many a vale, With full desire returns (at last) Unto his native bed, and there Sucks in his rest with full career. II Recalling then into his minde The horrid tempests he has known, The Alpie grades that he has gone? Then pleasantly he begins to finde The preeminence of that same place Where first his life began the race. III And having by experience found No orb more dulcid then his own, No soyl so soft to tread upon; He re-implants upon this ground, And having well resolved, then He'l die before he'l leave't agen. IV Lady, my love's this traveller, Its native Countrey is your Brest, And there it found a native rest: Till led by fancie, it did erre: And being gall'd by fancie's fraud, It by all means would go abroad. V Then out it went, and stray'd about In every hedge, and every hole; And scan'd the clifts of many a soul. It peep't within, and spi'd without: Making a serious inquisition Through every region, and condition. VI Some love I found, but thin and sad; For every calm and gentle look, That from my Mistresse eyes I took, Ten times ten thousand frowns I had: Then did I sigh, and sighing say, I will return to Claria. VII There's zeal refin'd, there's love enough; There's morall parts, and sacred grace; There's good conditions and good face; There's not a glance that's rough: Then Claria open thou love's dore; And I will nere forsake thee more. 43. The Entertainment. Thalius the story thou hast told, Is Cupid's bow; and I can hold In no repulse, the winged boy Has quickly won the victory. The willing prize 'tis thou dost win; The door is open, enter in. 44. Claria's Blot. What's amiable that my Claria needs? Be it for feature, fortune, or for deeds, Or charitable vertues: can you say What is defective in my Claria? Survey her beauty, read the story ore Of her chaste life; go open every dore. Thus having done, return again, and see If ere you found a sweeter soul then she. One that can dally soft, yet not degrade From modesty; nor basely be betray'd. One that loves honour, yet in each condition, Is an antagonist unto ambition. Whose tongue (more shrill then Philomels) may be The Hieroglyphick of humilitie: Whose garb's the embleme of a decent maid; One that can trade with love, yet lust evade. One that is courteous, yet doth scorn to fall Into a vein that's hypocritical. One that is lovely, yet doth still deny To be apparent in each vulgar eye: One that is nobly born; and yet is one That scornes to call descent in question. One that is fair, and yet performs the task To veil her modest beauty with a mask. Though many fortunes court her, yet they are No props of pride; nor cited as a snare To trap her lovers. Every thing she does, Expresses vertue: liberally she flowes With wholsome counsell: she retains in store, A hand for every work: for every sore A proper Salve: she's a sure Physician For every accident, and each condition. But here's the main perfection that she lacks; She (payes her rent, but) will not pay her tax. Loves souldiers labour under Claria's ray; But my Claria will allow no pay. Ah Claria, Claria, if so be you would Content your souldiers as (indeed) you should, With smiles and kisses, and imbraces too, You'd nere want souldiers to contend for you. But here's our woe, when we our armes erect, And yet you will allow us no respect. 45. To the Venerean Cow-herd. I Fall on, fall on, (fond Cow-herd) fall And hold thy deer in chase. The man that never moves at all, Is alwaies where he was. He playes no play, the fencer knowes, That keeps his guard and makes no blowes. II Go arm'd with courage, and the sin Of Cupid, and assault her. At one essay I'd either win The Mare or lose the halter. It is no progresse unto honour, Only to stand and gaze upon her. III It was not Alexander's wit, To dally and delay: For had he ever practis'd it, He had not born away The worship'd wreath of fame, nor hurl'd Reports of conquest ore the world. IV Despair not 'thou at thy descent, Nor th' weaknesse of thy strength: Though now she's flinty to relent, She may grow soft at length. Perpetual and accustom'd knocks, Will bruise and break the hardest rocks. V What though the glistering lumps of fame Upon her beauty strove? Ev'n such whose sparks might yce inflame, Yet could not gain her love. Hold thou thy course, and forward run, A torch burns hotter then the sun. VI The wanton Goats warm bloud will part The Diamond in two, Which neither Vulcans fiery art Or steell could ever doe. Some Girles choose rather swaines in rags, Then mighty Bashawes and their bags. 46. The shattered Heart. I Love put his bow into my hand, Charg'd with a golden dart; And gave, withall, a strict command To shoot into thy heart. Moreover unto me he said, He would assist me with his aid. II Now on the pile of this my dart (As lovers use to doe) I fixt my own aspiring heart, And then I shot at you. And shooting hit your breast of flint, But 'twas so hard it stuck not in't. III My heart was shattered at this blow; It fell so fierce thereon. Thus seeking Claria's heart (I trow) My own was overthrown. And like a hawk that strikes beside The game, my heart fell down and di'd. 47. The Jubile. I Tell me no more of Jubiles Esteemed by the Jewes; Olympick games, and such as these, Which ancient Rome did use: And did destroy their cares upon The racks of recreation. II O tell me not of Turkish glories, Great Mah'met and his pride. Nor touch me with tyrannick stories, How men for zeal have di'd With an implicite faith; to prove His blasphemie, and their blinde love. III All triumph humane thoughts require, My Claria's breast doth keep: She warmes chill comfort by her fire, And charmes the gods to sleep: What Roman, Turk, or Jew hath found Of blisse, in Claria doth abound. IV She is my Jubile alone, Lets captiv'd thoughts go free; Restoring joyes doubt seized on, To long'd for liberty. Here may I bath each wearied limb, And in the pool of Beauty swim. V Whose silver streams all griefs allay, And make all torments light, While I injoy her smiles by day, And sport with her at night, What undigested thought shall rest Within the angle of my brest? VI Let pilgrims seek St. Peters shrine, And Saints, Saints rags adore, I'le Idolize thy face divine, For ever, ever more. Let misers and their bags unite, Thou art my treasure and delight. VII Let they whose airy wills request To blow ambitious bellowes, Lift up the Owle to th' Eagles nest, And sore above their fellowes. Yet while I graft upon thy stem, I would not change my fate with them. 48. The Leveller. I All mortall men are born to dye: The earth is each mans mother. O then my genius tell me why One man's above another? From dust we came, And to the same Our tribute's paid: then we resign our powers; When death shall strike, we are no longer ours. II Why then should one man be a Prince? Another poor as Job? One clad in Velvet to convince Him that has scarce a robe? Thus freedom's curb'd, And we disturb'd. Shall humane statutes gage our recreation? The Law is void since Gospel came in fashion. III Where all's alike, who should obey? Or who should be attended? Or who our failings shall repay, Where all men have offended? When Cain was try'd For fratricide, It was his God condemn'd him, I assure ye, No man was Judge, nor no man on the Jury. IV Yet now our custome's grown so base, That he whom fortune blesses, Is pearcht on some commanding place, Though he no reason guesses, And then this man Must pry and scan Into my life, and if he findes an error, His word shall be my bane, his frown my terror. V Since then poor mortals must be led By custome, not by reason, One step awry I will not tread, Then I shall know no treason. They shall not see One blot in me, And then for pardon I'le not vex my senses: He needs no mercy that has no offences. VI I'le not contrive with State-designes, Not squeeze my brains by thinking. I'le presse my grapes, and prune my vines, And passe my time in drinking. Then gallant soul Fill up the boul, Whilest full-grown Bacchus blowes delightful bellowes, And here's a health to all true hearted fellowes. 49. Thorando and Clara. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this poem as follows: For Tho. read Thorando For Cla. read Clara Thorando. I prethee (Clara) let me know Whether thou lovest me, or no. Clara. Love thee Thorando, prethee why? Tho. Not for my wealth, but loyalty. Cla. She that loves all that Loyal be, Must love whole Myriads more then thee; And then how feeble are those rayes That branch into so many wayes? One of the which I yeeld to you, Because I think your story true. Thorando. Alas, alas, such love as this Will not boy up a lovers blisse; There is a love like Juniper, Which loyall Cupid doth confer In Ladies breasts, and it is such As burns the heart at every touch. And when we are thus heated, then This Juniper cools us agen. Such is the love that I would have: Such is the love that Hero gave Unto Leander, and beside, In the same faith she liv'd, she di'd. Such is the love as goes alone: And only shoots her darts at one. Such is the love as ought to be Adored for monopoly. Oh! tell me then, and let me know Whether thou lov'st Thorando so? Clara. Me thinks I feel my sparks begin, To sieze upon my soul within: But they are feeble, and I doubt, For want of breath, they will go out. Tho. Oh! fear not Clara; I will blow Loves bellowes, and will make them grow: Thy smoking spirits I will rouze With kisses, glances, and my Vowes. Then from his budget he did pull His lusty bellowes, fraighted full. And on her sparks he blew so fast, That all became on fire at last. And ere from thence he could retreat, His bellowes were consum'd with heat. 50. Forc'd Love. I O do not urge me with an idle tone, For my resolved thoughts to own What my fixt fancie'l not imbrace, Were a preposterous thing: I can not cling These, where affection will not interlace. II Forc't love is fretfull, and a heart thus snar'd Against its will, proves afterward Irregular, and will not stay In its own sphere, but glides On other sides With crooked motions; and will not obey. III The toyle is tedious; and to her that will Only pretend love, to fulfill A disposition; must indure A soul-offending curse, And sorrowes worse, Because she's branded with a love impure. IV Then call thy fancy from th' intended scope; Thy labour's void; in vain thy hope. No talent here thou canst improve. I have no art to shroud Love in a cloud. And where I can not, there I will not love. 51. To Thraso. Silence, (bold Thraso) let our wits alone, They are no theams to whet thy follies on. Cease Mongrill, cease thy vanity: 'twere fitter Thou shouldst be howling in the currish litter Of thy own whelps: where with a doggish look, Thou might'st be poring on the Parish-book Of Ignorance, and never dare to spye Into our Casket with an envious eye. Rail not at rimes, lest Poetry become Thy bane, and bring thee to a dunghill tombe Of infamy. Poor worm, how dar'st thou follow The Peers and Chaplains of the great Apollo, With snarling, whining voyce? Canst thou not tell Their genii are beyond a parallel? We scorn equality, tell me what powers Are known to man, that we account not ours? Who can exceed us? who can go beyond us? Where's he that dares assault us? or command us? We vie with gods, (then let not men disclaim us) 'Tis they make men, and we that make them famous, 'Tis we that lift up to the stars; and there We file the records of their praise, and rear A ruin'd progeny, and do translate The feeble rags of a declining fate, Into new suits of dignity, and then With as much ease we can pull down agen Their high flown fame, and cut their glory short, If once we but conceive a reason for't. Then cease (I say) and do not thou assail To strive against the strength, that will prevail Above thy perisht power. Are not we The pinnacles of Soveraignty? To us Kings veil their bonnets; and confesse Our sacred blessings, and our worthinesse In all imployments; it is we that tread Down every verbal foe, and daring head. We are the parents of the gods: if we Keep Poems dormant, where's the Deity? Jove we invented, Mars and Bacchus too; Then are we not their fathers? how think you? Our Charter is divine, I'd have you know it, No priviledge to th' Painter and the Poet. 'Tis we that crush your vices; and that can Conjure the fury of the proudest man Into a shittle-cock. 'Tis we that rise (With undepressed raptures) to the skies, Triumphing there ore every snarling foe That (in a currish humour) barks below. Vain hopes then cease, or else Apollo must (By th' Organ-bellowes) blow thee unto dust: We span the world, the Misers we defie, Their gold's an eye-sore to a Poets eye; We scorn such drosse. And he that shall subscribe Unto the incantation of a bribe, Is but Apollo's bastard, and must be For ever branded with indignity. We hisse down all his honour, and we hate him; And from our covent excommunicate him, He's none of us: 'tis only such as finde An unsuppressed, uncontrolled minde, Transcending fortune, with a face that charmes All grieving sorrowes and afflicting harmes; That pines not in the study, nor contracts His cheeks into live Mumma by his acts, That over-looks small injuries; and still Thinks puny-rogues unworthy of his quill. 52. Phorco and Parlio. Phorco. Fairer then beauty, in her pomp descri'd, Or Venus tri'd Unto the third degree, Is that Seraphick she, That vowes her love and constancy to me. Parlio. Such splendor cannot but amate thy sense: Such influence Sure't cannot choose but cloy All thy felicity; And make thee make a footstool of thy Joy. Phorco. O no it cannot, but her beauty brings A pair of wings To me, as to the flies Gives Titan from the skies, Whereby (as they do) I (poor I) arise. Parlio. So, then it seems th' art but a fly at best, And here's the jest: Untill thy Mistresse bring (By her sweet beams) a wing, Th' art but a cripl'd fly: Alas poor thing! 53. The Retired Lady. I And why devoted to the Cave? Is this the end? The finall end? hath nature gave You Gems to hide, and not extend? Or (like Narcissus) are you bent With your sweet self to complement? II When you were born sure Nature meant some other thing: Whose meaning (by your discontent) You'ld peevishly to ruine bring. The Sun doth shine, the stars hold forth, And so should you expose your worth. III Why should a face whose magick may weak souls recrute, The vallons and the veils obey? Or wherefore should that tongue be mute, Whose harmony to mortall ears, Sings high, and sweeter then the Spheres? IV Each, for her Countreys welfare, came into the earth. Part of her best parts we may claim, As truly forfeit at her birth; Yet since forc't boons are not so kinde, We'l beg your face, and vertuous minde. V As did Medusa, by her eyes, To stones convert Each daring look; so thine surprise; But 'tis not with Medusa's art. As flesh to stones transformed she, So stony hearts are broke by thee. VI Thy sacred lips, where cherries grow, Set round with spice, Whence loves Electars freely flow; Why in recesse constrain'd so nice? Sure he shall die unblest that misses The famous booty of your kisses. VII Will thy bright beams be ere the lesse For lightning me? Or will it blur thy comlinesse? Or stigmatize thy dignitie? Then lie no longer in the Mines: Diana's chast, and yet she shines. VIII Pray what avails Danae's tower? Or what content Is Couched in the golden shower, While she receives imprisonment? The life of beautie's by resort, Not in the prison, but the Court. IX Then bring thine Eastern cheeks abroad; And hide no more Those Gems each judgement would applaud, And with a reverence adore. So both your self and we in this Shall have the greater share in blisse. 54. Loves outside. I No more of love, away, Avoid fond Girl: Seek not our wits to slay Only with shels of pearl. That was begotten of a lump of earth; Spew'd from corrupted bowels, so took birth. II Shut up thy Magazeen In velvet masks, Leave not thy beauty seen: Nor put fond thoughts to tasks; For all the pleasures to our eyes you bring, Are but loves wanton shadow, not the thing. III What if thine ivory hand (Which we adore) I boldly durst command, Ten thousand times and more, To kisse, alas, what were it to suffice The thirst of love? or quench the flames that rise? III Nay could my license yet More freely slip, If Cælia would commit The bounty of her lip Unto my pleasure, there to play and sport, All this is but the Lobby of Loves Court. IV Or should my bended armes Thy wast confine, And thou (with equall charmes) Shouldst lie impaling mine, These cannot ravish; nor reside upon A heart that presseth at perfection. V No fainting breath, no glance, Nor leering smile, Nor motion shall advance My fancy; or beguile A thought that's fixt, for I have tri'd the pain, And am resolv'd I'le nere love so again. 55. To Cælia, in the fields. Why wilt thou go? (fair Cælia) why? What's needfull, of importancy, That can without thee, not be done? Why wilt thou leave me all alone? I have but seen thy face: as yet We had no time to speak, nor sit. Good Cælia stay, and do not lower, Let's couch in this Eglantine bower. Behold the quavering sprigs, how they Move almost in a sensual way, With morall action, seeming too Through invitations unto you. Come, come, with folded armes, let's lie In a proportion'd symmetrie: See you the birds in yonder tree, How loving and how peart they bee? How they from sprig to sprig remove, And with their bills decipher love? Let me upon thy golden tresses, And veins, (those Azure wildernesses) Hop like these birds: and let my hand Wander along thy unknown land, To finde how well the fruit doth rise, (As in Canaan Israels spies) And if the same I do approve, Therein Ile plant my vine of love: And with a pleasant pain I'le frame A fertile vineyard in the same. Come, do not weep; 'twill do thee good: It will refine corrupted bloud. Then struggle not, nor do not shriek, I have no weapon that can strike A deadly blow. 'Twill not disease thee With greater wounds then what shall please thee. See yon big-bellied ewe, that (late) Receiv'd the marrow of her mate: She looks most lovely; so will you Now you receive your lovers too. Then have at all, upon't I'le enter, And plant my vine there at a venter. 56. Her Reply. He that nere drank was nere a dry: And he that nere knew liberty, Regards it not: and she that can Not by experience says what's man, Desires him not: but when she knowes What vertue from his nature flowes, She's mad t'imbrace him, and doth guesse His presence her best happinesse. Before I tri'd thee, I abhorr'd Thy proffer'd love, and could afford No wanton thought; but now I see Thy spirits, and their energie; My soul to thee I will resigne, There is no pleasure like thy vine. 'Twill make me fruitfull, and I swear, Plant thou alwaies, I'le alwaies bear. And though this fruit too ponderous grow, I'le gladly die in bearing so. 57. The unequall Match. And why unto this stump would you be ti'd, That were so hopefull and so fair a bride? How dull? how dead? how drowsie? and how cold Are all your amplectations? and how old? How crasie? crouched? and how feeble is He that should surfeit you with Hymens blisse? Better you never had the smallest sense Of love, then not injoy its influence. What can expected be from him, whose head Is fleec'd with snow-bals; and imbattered With sixty years assaults: whose breath affords Him language but in groans, and not in words. Pity, thrice pity, that so sweet a she Should lose her teeming time, and barren be For want of agriculture: what's the cause You derogate so far from Cupid's lawes? And spoyle his tenets? why should Gems that shine Quite through the surface of your sacred Mine, Perish for want of gathering? and decay By wrong perusals in an unknown way? 58. Her Reply. 'Tis true, he's aged, and therefore we bring His well experienc'd years unto the thing; In former times he did the work, and than He was well known to be a knowing man. And now he's worthy, though his office be To digitate, and gravely to ore-see. This makes him happy: (and in him my self Bright shining in his lucubrated pelf) What ever's planted by anothers sweat, Drest, prun'd and water'd by his wholsome heat, Yeelds him the issue. Hence it then remains; He has the profit, others take the pains; And I the pleasure: no defect doth come For want of husbandry unto my womb. Or, though he eyes me with a jealous care; I've time enough to horn him, and to spare. Age is no watchman, but his eyes give ore At five a clock ith' even (or before) T'incite the heart with jealousie: or see The least attempt on his propriety. His age-dry'd limbs dull Morpheus doth confine, While youthfull Cupid is unfolding mine. 59. To the Academick. Think not to daunt us with a daring eye, The Maze of Logick, or maturity Of your taught (cience, and intangled rules, (The scum and dregs of Academick pools) Boast not of these, nor strive with censure nice) T'esteem your deer-bought wisdome by the price. Think no excesse you have; no power doth dwell In this accustom'd way, to mak't excell. This can create no wonder: we disclaim All sorts of admiration at the same. Who findes by seeking, a concealed treasure, Payes equall pains for's profit and for's pleasure. He has no novelty: he gains no more Then what his fancy did expect before. Is this a wonder if it's wisely view'd? Or does it savour of beatitude? He that's apprentice, though the veriest fool, Doth (by instruction) learn his Masters rule. He keeps his folly still, although he's made A skilfull artist in his Masters trade; He learn'd by teaching, hence it came about, But he's ingenious gets the trade without. Come then my spark: thou of th' Oxonian race, And let a word of reason interlace With thy ambition. Grammar is thy sphere, And thou canst travell in no path but there: That's all thou hast; why, thou hast bookt it fair, Thou canst scarce tell us what the Morals are. Thou, of Philosophy, no more hast known Then what tradition, and the books have shown. Thou keepst the track, and only goest by course. And I must tell thee, that each Carriers horse Performs thy task; and has as much to bee Ador'd for, or admired at, as thee. Th' adventuring Merchant, that is wafted ore, To seek for jewels on the Indian shore, Is not so happy in his far-fetcht geer, As he that stayes at home and findes it here. What think'st thou now? Sayes not th' impartial test, That Art's but feeble? Nature is the best. Suppose your fancy leads you unto court, Perhaps you are able to speak Latine for't; And now and then spew out a phrase of Greek; But for invention you are far to seek. You to the book must go if you would ken The customes and Moralities of men. We do not so; our method is divine; We go by inspiration, nor by line. And we can tell you in our modern tongue, We know our right, and can revenge our wrong Without your Edicts: we can work or play, We do not value what the Schoolmen say. But you grave wits, (where art and nature meet) I humbly worship, and with reverence greet: Because I know, where these united are, The motion there will be more regular. But you it is, 'gainst whom my Muse doth rore, That have been taught each science, and no more; And of a little make as great a show, As if your knowledge had no more to know. 60. The Drawer to his Lady. I The God of love to me is come, And in my fancy flew; And bids me seek Elizium In nothing else but you. The oracle has told me so, My vine alone in you will grow. II Then let your flames reflex agen On him, whose glory 'tis To Court your eye-beams now and then, And steal from you a kisse. Let our two hearts move in one sphere; And so we will the vineyard rear. III The vines we'l prune, the grapes we'l presse, With secrecy and sport: 'Twill ask no toyl, nor heavinesse: Taste, and you'l thank me for't. Come then, and with the Drawer close, And see the juice that from him flowes. IV Apollo's Nectar is an Asse: Nepenthe's nothing worth, If match'd with our Canary-glasse, When love doth set it forth, Come then and with the Drawer joyne, His love and liquor is divine. V And if we see our labours yeeld Issues and profits deep, Thy Tunne shall once a year be fill'd, And we'l a Tavern keep. Good Lady then be pleas'd to shape Your love unto the Drawers grape. VI Your belly shall the Cellar be, The upper room's your face; Whose bright and painted bravery, Who cannot but imbrace? Come then and with the Drawer mix, And we will live by Mere-trix. VII Thy legs are gallond-pots (my Deer, I prethee do not blush) The door of entrance, shall be where Already hangs a bush. Come then, and with the Drawer cling, And see the profit of the thing. VIII Thy folded armes shall be the Bar, Thy nod shall be the Sign; Thy words shall serve for Bels that are In rooms to ring for Wine: This done, I dare presume that we Shall never out of custome be. 61. The Mysterie. I Bewitching Boy, how can it be That gods and men should bow to thee? Thou hast a dart Strikes many a heart. And yet no Seeker ere could know, Or how, or why it should be so. In love we live, in love we die; But we conceive no reason why. II This is a mystery that has bin Ere since the age the gods liv'd in. Each age and sex This ghost doth vex: Jove hurried on by Cupid, he To gain the prize, I beast will be. In love we live, &amp;c. III He's chang'd unto a Bull, and so, Europa must a bulling go; And lest he misse Soft Leda's kisse, Or she should want dame Natures use, He'l be a Swan, and she a Goose. In love we live, in love we die, But we conceive no reason why. IV Neptune we rank among the rest, As savouring grosly of the beast, Before that he Depriv'd will be Of Theophanes love (his Dear) A pair of Rams hornes he will wear. In love we live, &amp;c. V Why to hell did Orpheus goe? Hercules, and Æneas too? Did not it prove To be for love? But here's the thing that startles me, What reason for such love may be. In love we live, &amp;c. VI Some say it's beauty that injoynes Our roving thoughts, and them confines. But Jove I know It is not so. Our Mistresses deformed were, Till love and Poems made them clear. Then by this argument we prove, Love creates beauty that not love. VII Some tell us riches is the goad That rules our fancy in this road: My Genius cries It's otherwise: 'Cause with Quotidian eyes we see Love practising on poverty. In love we live &amp;c. VIII Some say its vertue we adore, And wisely fall in love therefore: But I forbear To settle here, 'Cause Cyprian lads I've seen rejoyce In the polluted armes of vice. In love we live, &amp;c. IX No face, nor fate, nor vertues are, Love's sole-illaqueating snare. No cause can be Found out by me, Why for a she we take such pains, We bruise our limbs, and break our brains: Only in love we live and die, But never know the reason why. 62. The Countrey Girl. I A Pox on your Dames that scorch with their flames, And fire us alive in the city: I would they might go to the devil below; For they are most wickedly witty. II The Jewels they wear in their ears and their hair, And their breasts that are open and naked, Are as bills that are set on a house to be let, And who ever pleases may take it. III Their faces do shine like the Sun in the line: God a mercy the colours they laid on. But did you but see how ugly they be When th' are off, them you would be afraid on. IV I am for the lasse that doth pisse on the grasse, Though the Courtiers unworthy esteem her: She is pleasant and neat, and her carriage compleat, And her cheeks are as brown as a leemer. V You freely may sip on her sanctified lip, Although she be easily danted: The snow on her brow did nature allow, She's neither perfumed nor painted. VI She learns not to cheat in the School of deceit; Her heart is dissolv'd in her speeches. She scornes that while you the matter shall do, One should run away with your breeches. VII Her glances they be out of innocency, Yet blow for blow she will give duly. She gives you your fill, and lets you lie still; For she scornes to be counted unruly. 63. Reproof. O you inchanting fairest fair; Whose powers more then Magick are, Upon a mortall breast, forbear For want of love, to slay me. Let not one ray upon me light, Unlesse affection you unite With every aspect, beams so bright Cannot but over sway me. How could the Africans abide To look upon Apollo's pride, And to that fiery zone be ti'd In toyle exhausting sweat? Did not Apollo's power extend, Causing earths bowels to ascend; And unto every native lend His nourishment with heat? Your beauty is this torrid flame, Whose colours scorch where ere they came, And browes with furrowes do unframe And galls me with despair. But the Eglantine spicie grove, That's in your sacred breast and love, Can mitigate that fire above, And sun-burnt souls make fair. Then shut those eyes of Juniper; And let them not their heat transfer To me your sad Idolater; Unlesse you mean to love. Or else beneath these beams I die, You gain the guilt of tyranny; And so impawn your dignity, And grieve the gods above. 64. Bacchus. I And why such a drouth has infested my mouth? Is my lip and the cup faln asunder? And do they intend nere to end Their dissension? Oh it were a wonder If I should fall out with so cordial a friend. II Fill the boul, do not think I'le be bank'd of my drink; He that will, falleth lower then folly: I will liquor my brains, that my strains May with triumph tread down melancholly: And this will be freedome in fetters and chains. III Had the fool Icarus laid his policy thus, His wings (made of wax) had not melted; But he well might have flown to the Zone Whereto his desires ambitiously pelted: And then his Catastrophe nere had been known. IV Had the sack made him moist, he might have rejoyc't, And sung his P-wit like a Plover: But alas he fell short, and paid for't; He was drown'd in the sea, and he could not get over: Thus 'twixt fire and water he spoyled the sport. V Or if Phaeton in this method had gone; Lesse harm he had done, &amp; more wit he had learned. Had he fixed his sack on the back Of the Sun, sure the world it would never have burned, Nor he and his credit indured the wrack. VI Take a soul that is sous't in the Sack he caroust, He has wings that advance at his pleasure: He's indow'd with a minde drives the winde, And vaults ore the flouds of affliction at pleasure; His heart in a dungeon is never confin'd. VII Take a man in his wine, he's for any design; He looks in the face of the proudest imployment: And his will does not roave, nor remove The greatest of Princes has no such injoyment; He dwels where the Deity resteth above. VIII He defies the base fear of a Parliamenteer, And scorneth the frowns of the high man: All his care is, to think on his drink; And smilingly biddeth a pox on the dry man That wastes in his cell, and consumes with his chink. IX Then again fill the boul, let it merrily troul: Play out with your Rummikins quicker, Let the cares of the world, all be hurl'd In your cups, and be drown'd in your liquor, And drink till your noses with rubies are pearl'd. X Let it fall to your lot to be plung'd in the pot; And suffer your brains to be sacked with drinking; From the merry merry glasse do not passe, You'l finde it is better, if weighed in your thinking, Then for to be sackt as Jerusalem was. 65. The Rejection. I All in vain turn again, Why should I love'r? Since she can love no man, I will give over, I'le not stay to obey, But will retire. Why should I thither flie, And not injoy her? II Let her still please her will With a deniall: She shall be unto me As the Sun-diall. Let her bloud raise the mud: All in good season. I'le not gaze on her face Till I have reason. 66. Loves Arrant. I Arme Cupid, arme: Gird on thy quiver, take thy bow And numbly go And seek a she that thou maiest charme. Flie thou into the myrtle grove, And there shoot down some pretty dove. II For I am flush, Big-belli'd with desire to prove The pain of love, And feel the Sun-shine of a blush. Yet will I not ingage in heart, Unlesse the object have desert. III Go then and seek Some glorious brow, some sacred eye, From whence doth flie Rayes all divine, some rosie cheek, Wherein such lively grace is carv'd, As may recall a spirit starv'd. IV Shoot such a heart As innocency doth controul: Pierce such a soul That loves in love, and not in art. Such, if she findes my love divine, Melts all her pleasures into mine. V Bring not the coy, That starts and kicks at every touch; There's grace too much, She has more zeal then honesty. Bring not the proud deformed witches, That missing rocks, fall down in ditches. VI Bring not the sad That seem to thaw the stones with tears, Wherein appears Some Crocodilish bloud they had. Nor shoot thou down a fawning she, Lest with her smiles she ruin me. VII But bring a girl Whose mirth is of a heavenly dresse; Whose wantonnesse Is not a pick-lock, but a pearl; That will no common trader be, Though sh' has a good commodity. 67. The evil Temper. Alwaies sighing, alwaies pining, Alwaies out of frame; Alwaies puling, alwaies whining; Evermore the same. Alwaies fill'd with lamentation; Love is not feasted so: Continual tears, continuall passion Is but continual woe. I hold her temper in derision, Since she is guided thus, Depart from me with expedition, And hug Heraclitus. If ere I dally with a lover, I'le have a pleasant she, That with a chearful smile blowes over The proudest injury. 'Tis vain to mourn for sliding blisse That is already gone; And full as vain, as vain it is With tears to think upon Approaching woes; hereby they creep Up to more ample sums: It's time enough for thee to weep For mischief when it comes. And since thy weeping will not aid Thee of the smallest thrall, When ere thy sorrowes thee invade, Thou need'st not weep at all. Remember this, and then repent, And sweetly thou shalt finde The peacefull Phœnix of content Will build within thy minde; And then I could my soul allow To thee (my dearest dear) But when I see a stormy brow, I think the Devil's there. EPIGRAMS. 1. Humility. I'th' petty Fourm this Lady sits, Learns innocency more then wits: Reads duty-lectures to her sons; Bid her but go, and straight she runs. Poor she at all times, and all places, Waits (servant-like) upon the Graces. She owns her self most vile and base; Yet her descent's the Royall race. 2. The Misers musick. Chink chink the coin cryes, and the musick pleases, It's like the dainty food that breeds diseases: 'Tis sweet and bitter, like the Siren charms, Lulls us to love first, then leaves us in harms. 3. The Blush. Seest thou the tincture in her face? It is the servant to her grace, To intimate to thee there's nought That's vicious harbour'd in her thought, And doth from Cyprian boyes exempt her Dazling the foul lascivious tempter. 4. A Tayler. There was a Taylor once a dagger wore: He wore it once, and never wore it more. He would have drawn and run it at my Bitch, I, but his heart would not go thorough stitch. 5. To Nell. Fond, fickle, frantick fancy, full of folly; Thy mirth is turned into melancholly. Thou swear'st thou wilt be wiser, and wilt hate Thy former vices, but it is too late. The Steed is stoln, and now thou shut'st the dore; But lo, thou shouldst have lockt it heretofore. 6. On Jack. Jack calls me rogue. My friend to me affords This sage advice, I pray lay hold on's words. Pish, pish, said I, 'tis better ten to one, To hold his ears, and let his words alone. Then by and by, (as it did well appear) I loos'd his words, and lug'd him by the ear. 7. A Sigh. Sighing she smil'd, and smiling sigh't. She smil'd to see the thing she lik't, And sigh't because she could not get It fast into her cabbinet. Had but her smiles a power, as well To draw, as do her sighs repell, She might be mistresse of the pray; But sighing she blowes all away. 8. Love. They say that love is alwaies blinde: I think (upon my soul) It is not true, because I finde He alwaies hits the hole. 9. Sim. Sim sayes he's highly blest, because he looks Upon abundance of religious Books. 'Tis true, he does so; yet he keeps his sin; He looks upon them, but nere looks within. 10. Lucia. Sweet Mistresse Lucia is a pretty thing: A Concubine that's worthy of a King: She is so full of beauty, and so fine, You'd think she were a spirit all divine. I'd swear the same, too, and to th' world I'd tel't, But that in truth I know she may be felt. 11. A Token. 'Tis not of custome that my Present comes: Nor yet with flattering, to enhaunce the sums Of drossie lucre. Neither doth it move On legs, as though it came to buy your love: For that were too ignoble to prevail; Your love's a thing not to be set at sale. But hence it cometh, with supposed voyce, To speak for him, whose speech is somewhat nice; Whose tim'rous spirit hardly dares to shew The tenure of that love I bear to you, Hence then, accept it, only as a sign Of his affection, who in heart is thine. 12. A lock of Hair. Why should we doat upon such things as these? What is it they afford us that can please A love-sick passion? or asswage the pain Of a disorder'd and distempered brain? Has it a priviledge that's more then these? Only to say it is our Mistresses. Poor feeble prize, no author of content: What honour rises from an excrement? I, but I finde a higher exposition: An Allegory, which on no condition, May be omitted for the good of either; It is a lock that locks two hearts together. 13. Loves gain. Love is a stock of money: and it's he That loves, that puts it out to usury. And 'tis the smile of Mistresses, (in jest) And wanton dalliance makes the interest. But wo is me, infatuate with pain: I finde my stock begets me little gain; For, whereas others (hackney-like) get store, Mine brings me nil per centum, and no more. 14. Torio. Toorio's in love, and greatly doth rejoyce, 'Cause he has lighted on so brave a choice: Yet with my curious eye I can discover In her, no beauty that may tice a lover. But I imagine why my Torio brags; She's precious not for beauty, but for bags. 15. Phorcus. Phorcus, one morning (and that's rare) Upon his bent knees went to prayer: Pray'd for remission of his sins; And that same morning broke his shins. A sad mischance it was, therefore He vowes to God he'l pray no more. 16. To the Executioner. Jervis the Hangman, when to him I quaffe, He cries, Your servant sit, it makes me laugh: But yet in faith I plainly tell thee Jervis, I love thee well, but I abhor thy service. 17. Thraso. In canting vessels, I have ever found The empty Hogshead yeelds the greatest sound. And hence it followes, that thy lofty strains Are but the symptomes of thy empty brains. 18. Gnatho. Gnatho (whose Muse is not so clear as common) Pins his Encomion on a Gentlewoman. He at the head begins, and thence doth greet Each member, till he comes unto the feet; Only the neck he scapes: I fain would know, Why on that part no verse he will bestow. I smell the plot, 'tis worthy of your laughter; He keeps the Neck-verse for himself hereafter. 19. Nell. Nell's very sick, and to the Cooks will go; (Sure sicknesse cannot be repelled so) He fills the board with custard, and with pie: And bids her eat, but she cries, No, not I. She longs for rolls, and though it be a sin, She will have none but the cooks rolling-pin. 20. Pigmalion. Why does Pigmalion on his picture doat? And to the worship of the same devote His purest thought? Pigmalion, dost thou see More value in thy image then in thee? That thou shouldst buckle, and incline thy wit To leave thy self, and fall in love with it? Alas Pigmalion, thou art but an Ape, That for the substance dost adore the shape. 21. Momus. Momus perhaps thou't say I am unkinde, Because I do not write to thee my minde. I tell thee Momus, thou art grown so nought, That I cannot allow thee one good thought. Yet this my custome shall for ever be, When ere I want a fool, I'le send for thee. The Conclusion: Or the Fornicator's farewell on his Death-bed. I Come you fair eyes, that with inflamed lust I once beheld; See you my judgement, sad and just. For now (alas) I am compel'd To hang my head, as 'twere half dead, Ah me! to th' grave I must. II And there my filthy carkasse must remain, Till the loud trump Ring heaven-knells throughout my brain, Giving new life to my dead lump: And re-inspires, with active fires, My empty pores again. III Then weep one tear or two before I die, And must be gone. You can attest, as well as I, What cruell wrong to me y'have done. And now y'have kend my fatall end, Seek you the same to shun.
