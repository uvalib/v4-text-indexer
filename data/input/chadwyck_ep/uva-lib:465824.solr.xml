      <field name="fulltext">Many grow proud of undeserv'd Success, But suddain Fame oft' dwindles to Disgrace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A SATYR AGAINST Bad Wine, &amp;c. Let B?ks and H?r vend their cloudy Wines, In Wapping Brothels, and in Country Inns; And furnish Midnight Cellars in By-Streets, For Roaring Bullies, Punks, and Sodomites; And by the trusty Help of Chip and Dash, Fill e'ery dusky Hole with liquid Trash; Squeez'd from the Berry which on Elder grows, Lengthen'd with Cyder, and made rough with Sloes. That Sweetners, when they've play'd some Villains Trick, With City Cull, Raw Youth, or Country Hick, And preach'd the Parson with a harmless Face, Or us'd the Rug and Leather with Success; May to some Midnight Dark house make their Way, Where B?ks and H?r jointly bear the Sway: There share their ill-got Booty e'er they part, O'er damag'd Dregs, at Sixteen pence a Quart. Where Butchers, Bailiffs, and their Flatcap Whores, Swear, drink, debauch, and squabble at All-sours, Till poison'd by bad Wines, with which they're pleas'd, They reel away drunk, droughty, and diseas'd; Who might in Time a Gallows Doom receive, Would Death's Two Agents let the Scoundrels live. But 'tis the Part'ners merciful Design, To rescue from the Rope, and kill by Wine: So Emp'ricks chase the Malady away, With artful Poisons, and by Physick slay. But since, Mossieurs, with your adult'rous Stuff, You've drench'd the low-priz'd Tipplers long enough: God Bacchus now, in Justice to each Son Who pays due Homage to himself and Tun, Dooms your dull Treacle no where to be found, Or guzzl'd, but in Dungeons under Ground; Where Alley-Gossips may for Gallons call, To burn at Christ'ning, or at Funeral: And good old Nurses fetch it by the Gill, For wealthy Misers when they're starving ill. That when the pois'nous Juice has pass'd their Throats, They may to Hell convey it in their Guts; And as descending to eternal Woe, Curse B?ks and H?r all the Way they go. But Truby, Witham, and their Part'ner Tash, Sell noble Wine, and scorn to deal in Trash. Nor do they only draw to e'ery Guest, Such Nectar as the Gods are wont to tast; But can by Tuns at cheaper Rates supply All Inns, and other Chaps that want to buy, With such salubrious sparkling Wine, that cures All those acute Distempers rais'd by yours. A mod'rate Dose drowns melancholy Cares, Repels the Thoughts of Taxes, and of Wars; Makes Party-Champions warm Disputes avoid, And tempts the Wise to chuse the safest Side. Inspires the sweet Musician to be free, E'er teaz'd with too much Importunity; Will to some sprightly Air his Genius raise, Without a Cat-call Prelude e'er he plays. Such as oft' us'd by th'Orpheus you prefer From Foot of Playhouse Stage, to Vintner's Bar; Who blindly scrapes at Sight, and seems to look, When e'er he reads his Notes, beside his Book. But give the Dev'l his Due, as we design, His Musick is too good to grace your Wine. Nor can my Bacchanalian Muse escape The Gridir'n Mimick, that Hibernian Ape; Who us'd, near Covent-Garden, to display His Colours e'ery Beef-stake Holiday, That Passengers thereby might understand, There liv'd the noted'st Monkey in the Land; Who in his Gestures could the World exceed, And outdo all that e'er Jack Adams did. Just so, on Fighting Days at Hockley-Hole, They hoist their tatter'd Ensign on a Pole; That strolling Vagabonds may know, that there Lives Tom the Fencing Bull, and Grim the Bear. But now, the Proteus who can please our Eyes With great Men's Follies, and Infirmities; Altho' 'tis obvious to the laughing Town, The Zany wants a Skreen to hide his own; Has laid aside his Party-colour'd Rag, And hangs a Bumper out instead of Flag. At which Emetique Sign, enough to make A Beau, or Man of Moderation, keck; To his old Friends, he B? and H? draws, And fills 'em Wine more odious than their Cause. What! tho' he was to Slops and Potions bred, To ease a grumbling Gut, or aching Head, His Poisons then by Drams were mix'd with Art, But now he sells worse Drenches by the Quart; And with his Bumper here will do more Ills, Than e'er he did in Dublin by his Pills: For B? and H? are destructive Foes To Covent-Garden Punks, and pepper'd Beaus. Therefore no longer shall those Emp'ricks reign, But fall beneath the poison'd Towns Disdain. Witham's One Leg shall kick 'em both down Stairs, And Tash's Castle fire about their Ears: Whilst Truby's Royal Arms, to all the Three, Shall give the Sanction of Authority. Thus shall the Twin-Ingrossers Fame decay, And like their perish'd Juices die away. Whilst the true gen'rous Sons of Bacchus crush Those Mungrel Tapsters, who, without a Bush, Wine eager draw, to th'Scandal of the Vine, Mix'd up with Sweets to make it pass for Wine. So Quacks, for Cordials, filthy Spirits sell, Which soon dispatch the Sick to Heav'n or Hell; Not caring whether they are bless'd or curss'd, Since they have pick'd the Patient's Pocket first. Let's therefore bear no longer the Abuse Of Bastard Vintners, and their Brickdust Juice. Fiddlers and Fools to Tavern Bars advanc'd, By crafty Knaves, by Blockheads countenanc'd; Who justifie their Wines, as Quacks their Pills, By the short Number of the Weekly Bills: When wiser Heads must own, that the Decrease Was owing to the Glut of Beans and Pease: And every Sort of Hortelage that's good To nourish Nature, and correct the Blood, That Begging Thousands were of Hunger freed, And had for fetching, what supply'd their Need. The Poor in Alleys kept continual Feast, And wholsome Roots and Herbs by Bushels dress'd. Thus wretched Crowds, who us'd to starve for Bread, Liv'd all in Clover, and like Princes fed: And what they spent before in stinking stale Unwholsome Meats, went now in nappy Ale. These were the Heav'nly Means that did restore Thousands to Health, who were infirm before; Prevented others Sickness, and preserv'd Many who, wanting Succour, would have starv'd. These are the Reasons the Account appears Much less at present, than in former Years. But had not those to Adam's Trade ally'd, Sav'd more than B? and H? have destroy'd; At the dead Bill we should have been surpriz'd, And they'd have had no Room to've advertiz'd. Therefore let's low'r the Topsails of the Two, Who set false Brethren up against the true; That they may trade in Holes without a Sign, And under-sell the lawful Sons of Wine, Who pay large Rents, and great Attendance keep, That we who drink, the Benefit may reap; And when inclin'd to ease the galling Weight Of worldly Cares, like Gods, carouse in State. Whilst stingy Sots to spurious Huts resort, To save but one poor Two pence in a Quart; By Beggars Lights sit cram'd in nasty Rooms, Poison'd with Spaul, and Oroonoko Fumes: Where ill-bred Slovens B? and H? draw In scanty Pots unseal'd, against the Law. Else blunder into Cellars, where they sit On wooden Planks, for none but Porters fit. Bless'd with no other Light by Night or Day, But Farthing Candles stuck in Clods of Clay: By which they see fat Slugs around 'em crawl, And varnish with their Slime the mould'ring Wall, Whilst Spiders in their woven Hammocks sleep On e'ery Side, like Tars Aboard a Ship; And when they're dry, by Vertue of their Twine, Spin down and pledge the Company in Wine. In such infernal Dungeons they may well, Insipid Stuff at under Prizes sell. But who'd not rather give a Groat a Quart For Wine in Paradise to chear the Heart, Than chuse a Brimstone Devil for his Host, And drink in Hell at an inferior Cost? But now, no more of interloping Knaves, Their fulsome Dregs, or understrapping Slaves; May all their Vaults and Hovels that amuse The Town, be turn'd to Brothels, and to Stews. And they that keep sham Tavern-Huts, become Panders to Jilts, or Followers to Bum. Whilst we proceed to sing the Praise of those Who scorn the Use of Cyder, or of Sloes; And to the lawful Sons of Bacchus show, How much Respect to them the Muses owe: Poets by Bacchus do their Wits refine, And can't but honour those who draw good Wine. May the Vine flourish near the Water-side, Where all that come are with the best supply'd. And may the neighb'ring Customhouse prefer Green's noble Wine, and no where drink but there. May the chast Widow prosper at the Swan By London-Bridge, where richest Wines are drawn; And win, by her good Humour, and her Trade, Some jolly Son of Bacchus to her Bed. May honest Johnson, blam'd without a Cause, Grow wealthy by the florid Wine he draws. Precedence claim of all in Gracechurch-street, For Claret nobly good, and truly neat. May courteous Rain, Commander of the Ship, The Fruits of civil Usage daily reap: Who with a winning Presence brings the best, And is respectful to the meanest Guest. May the Bull Head maintain their common Draught, Who ne'er debase true wholsome Wine with naught. Still let 'em keep their good old Custom up, Of treating Morning Friends with healing Soop. May Smith, who bears the Feathers for his Sign, Thrive, by reviving Mortals with his Wine: For none does more salubrious Juice command, Or serve us with a more obliging Hand. May Palmer, at the Tuns, encrease his Trade, Who draws both pow'rful White, and sparkling Red: By kind Reception still his Stock improve, And like his Father merit all Men's Love. May Gibson's Ship and Castle still defend That Reputation he has long maintain'd: By drawing Wines that chear the careful Breast, Good for Man's Health, and pleasing to the Tast. May Smith, whose prosp'rous Mitre is his Sign, To shew the Church's no Enemy to Wine, Still draw such Christian Liquor, none may think, Tho' e'er so pious, 'tis a Sin to drink. Whilst Thwaite's New Fountain flows, let none despair Of Port that's excellent, and Bourdeux rare: Both rang'd within his Vaults in order lie, To furnish those who want a fresh Supply. Behind the Change, may Drayton, at the Crown, With Cordial Claret still refresh the Town; That all his Friends may think his racy Wine Without a Fault, and worthy of his Sign. May Owen's Sun to such a Zenith rise, That all the City Dons his Wines may prize; And so extol his Claret, that the Town May drink his Sun still up, but never down. May Harry's Angel be a Sign he draws Angelick Nectar that deserves Applause: Such, that may make the City love the Throne, And like his Angel still support the Crown. May Kellet's Widow who deserv'dly thrives, Increase her Trade each happy Day she lives; Whose Ship at Anchor lies, to guard her House From windy Cyder, and unwholsome Juice. Let Palmer's worldly Sign, the Globe, denote That the World's pleas'd with his salubrious Draught: For none can better Wine dispense than he, Or treat their Guests with more Civility. May honest Clifton, at the Swan, still gain A thriving Credit from discerning Men: For without fawning he will draw us right, And ne'er deceive his Friends in Red or White. May Hicks, for Claret, always be in Vogue, And worry B?ks and H?r with his Dog: Where Toapers may command what's true and fine, And, like himself, grow jolly with his Wine. May Oxford's Arms the Widow still maintain, As Oxford does the Honour of the Queen: That Loyalty flow there like gen'rous Wines, Free from the Heart, unmix'd, without Designs. May prudent Willis, long on Ludgate Hill, To loyal Souls the best of Claret fill: That they who love the Crown may sing the Fame Of glorious Anna, who supports the same. May Beckley flourish, at the Royal Arms, Whose Virgin Red the nicest Palate charms: Does pensive Breasts to Love and Mirth incline, And justly claims the Sanction of his Sign. May Paine, at the Three Tuns in Newgate-street, Still draw the best, without the least Deceit; That his projecting Club, by Ev'ning Draughts, May be inspir'd with new successful Thoughts. May Tindal's Fountain flow with sprightly Juice, Such that may please his Guests, and fame his House: That, by the Vine, he may improve his Wealth, And with his own good Wines preserve his Health. May chearful Richmond prosper at the Crown, Who with delicious Claret warms the Town. Long may he hug that bright Hispanian Star, Who darts such Beams of Light'ning from his Bar. May Groness, at the Tuns in Shandois-street, Still draw us Wine that's generous and neat: Such that may comfort Nature, Life prolong, Make the Fair kind, and feeble Lovers strong. May Locket still his ancient Fame maintain For Ortland Dainties, and for rich Champaign: Where new-made Lords their native Clay refine, And into noble Blood turn noble Wine. May Brownjohn, at the Castle, ever be As famous for his Wine as Honesty: That e'ery Drop he draws may still be neat, And gen'rous, like himself, without Deceit. May Stanton, at the Sun, for ever shine, Whose Face proclaims the Goodness of his Wine. Nor can God Bacchus to the World commend A better Vintner, or a truer Friend. May the Cross-Keys, by Thavies-Inn, succeed, And famous grow for choicest White and Red: That all may know who view that costly Sign, Those Golden Keys command Celestial Wine. May Hyde, near Smithfield, at the Martyr's-Head, Who charms the nicest Judge with noble Red; Thrive on by drawing Wines which none can blame, But those, who in his Sign behold their Shame. May honest Folwell, at the Aldgate Pye, Still please the Palate, and delight the Eye; With genuine Claret, undisguis'd by Art, Quick to the Tast, and chearful to the Heart. May all the rest who deal in wholsome Juice, And in their Cellars scorn the cursed Use Of Drugs and Mixture, prosper and support Th'immortal Credit of the Flask and Quart; And, like true Sons of Bacchus, briskly join, To raise the ancient Glory of the Vine, By cramping Tapsters, who in Dungeons sell Rheumatick Wines, tho' bred to fulsome Ale: Set up by B? and H?, who supply Their Huts with such as Vintners scorn to buy. Ignoble Juice, so scandalous and lean, It ought to be distill'd, e'er drank by Men. Such meagre Wines at first, the Quarrel made Between the Two fam'd Merchants, and the Trade; Who in Revenge with Fools and Fiddlers join, That Musick and Grimace may vend their Wine. If therefore you would live for ever, chear Your drooping Spirits with the best, tho' dear: Drink noble Wine, and triumph over Death, 'Tis Nectar gives the Gods immortal Breath. For what may be said further on this Subject, I refer you to my Friend Martial. Quid te, Tucca, juvat vetulo Miscere Falerno In Vaticanis Condita Musta Cadis? Quid tantum fecere boni tibi pessima Vina? At quid fecerunt optima Vina Mali? De nobis facile est: Scelus est Jugulare Falernum, Et dare Campano toxica Sæva Mero. Convivæ meruere tui fortasse perire, Amphora non meruit tam pretiosa mori. FINIS.</field>
