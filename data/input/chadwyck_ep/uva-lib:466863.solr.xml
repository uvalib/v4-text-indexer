      <field name="fulltext">“Lie there, my pen! Only a little longer, And then thy work shall be for ever done: Death in these pulses daily groweth stronger; Life's ruby drops are oozing one by one; The dreams that flowed through thee shall soon be dreamed alone.” My Old Letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. BLUE ABOVE. (Written for some Glasgow friends.) Above your tallest chimneys, Ye men of Glasgow, rise! There are grander things than chimneys In these forgotten skies. Leave gloriously beneath you Your dingy demi-jour, Your fog, and smoke, and steam-drift, Your palpable obscure. There is blue above your city; There are stars above the blue, Unbegrimed and unbemisted, Though shaded from your view; Above your masts and pendants, Above your house-top wires, Above the Stygian columns That crown your furnace fires. Aim high, yet higher, higher, Beyond the planets seven; Your smoke hath not yet tainted The golden air of heaven. At your feet see yonder ladder, Right through the city haze; It riseth to the mansions Of everlasting praise. On that city gate it resteth, Where all is crystal clear; No smoke, no mist, no dimness, In that fair atmosphere. December, 1879. THE WORLD'S STORM. “The sea and the waves roaring.” —Luke xxi. 25. The tempest has been long, and through the sky Wander the clouds, uncertain of their way; The air is thick, and the old sun on high Is hiding still his beauty from the day, Under some sad eclipse or silent, sore decay. Round the wide earth the storm its war doth wage; O'er the far sea it spreads its saddening gloom, Nor noon nor night its anger can assuage; As if above us hung some hopeless doom, Preparing for our race an everlasting tomb. And sin hath done it all! The heavy years, Burdening the ages, owe their heaviness To this alone—the thousand griefs and fears Which speak humanity's unhealed distress, And all its told or untold broken-heartedness. Where'er we go, 'tis shipwreck, shipwreck still; The shore is strewed with relics of the gale; Look where we may, from tower, or cliff, or hill, We see the broken barque, the shivered sail, Or hear from dying lips the long, wild, woeful wail. Far off or near, the unabated power Of evil reigns, confessed or unconfessed. The prince of evil knows his day and power; O'er the dark earth he reigns, from east to west, The spirit of misrule, the angel of unrest. The world is not what it was meant to be, Nor is it what it shall one day become; It writhes beneath its wasting misery, Crying for help, even when it seems most dumb, And of its stormy ages counts the weary sum. Yet need it not despair, for help is near, And “Peace be still” shall bring the mighty calm, Shall bid the storm depart, the sin, the fear, The rose come up, the myrtle and the palm, And all its vales send up the universal psalm. November 23rd, 1878. MY HOLYDAY. THE HYMN OF A CHRISTIAN WORKER. Stay, stay behind me here, my busy thoughts, While I go yonder for a little while. Nay, do not follow me; let me forget My city stir, and fret, and heat, and toil. Tarry behind me; vex me, touch me not, Ye endless aches of heart, and brow, and brain; Vanish like mist, each scene that would recall My vision to the crowd and street again. Pursue me not; but let me calmly go To the retirement which the Master sought, Set free from all that would encumber me, Or mar the oneness of the heavenly thought. The stillness of the closet's stillest hush, The lonely silence of the lonely wood, The stream, the sea, the cliff, the dusky moor Shall furnish me with fruitful solitude. Tarry behind me for a season, then, Beloved workers for the Master here; I go that I may find in gentle rest New fitness for the work so grand and dear. Tarry behind, leave me, dear friends, alone, Companions of my days and nights of toil; I shall return to you refreshed for work: Leave me alone with God, alone awhile. I would return to work with you on earth, The health of my whole man revived, restored, Again to labour with you side by side, In the one vineyard of our common Lord. From my calm weeks of solitude and prayer, Of converse with the High and Holy One, Whose work with these poor hands we seek to do, I would return to you a holier man. Help me, my comrades on the harvest-field; Help me, companions in the holy war; That in the eternal firmament I may Shine with the brightness of no common star. Greystonelees, Berwickshire, August 23rd, 1882. YON SHADED GLEN. Far up yon shaded glen, When morn is softly waking, I hear the brooklet's lay, Through lonely willows breaking. To muse alone I wander on, Afar from city riot; That sky so near, that strain so clear, This glen the home of quiet. Waters of love and light, With sun-mist sweetly glowing, My spirit drinketh in The magic of your flowing; The song of mirth beyond this earth, Unmixed with sin or sorrow: Your loving song still pours along, To cheer each rising morrow. No revel-roar is here, Stirring the brain's wild fever; Coolness, and calm, and rest, Breathe o'er this tranquil river. Pure streams of peace and pleasantness That never sing of sadness, Oh, teach my soul, as on ye roll, The secret of your gladness! Dear brooklet of the hills In this lone vale of quiet, Oh, cast your cooling spell O'er earth's hot haunts of riot! Tell of the life beyond the strife Where, with soft brilliance glowing, The stream above of endless love From fountains pure is flowing. August 2nd, 1882. THE HILL BEYOND. “Superat cacumine nubes.” —Ovid, Met. i. 317. Deep lies the valley; in its hollows sleeps The darkness stern and still— Darkness that may be felt; But clear and fair, above, beyond, there towers The everlasting hill. None like it here on earth— The hill of God, upon whose boundless slopes The holy myriads stray, The host of the redeemed; The hill of heaven, on which the splendour rests Of never-ending day, The day without a sun. Into these depths we go, as, step by step, This life moves downward still Into the place of tombs. Yet not on these we fix our eye, but on The everlasting hill, Beyond the place of tombs— The hill of life, where sparkle all in dew Flowers of an endless May, Roses of life and love; The hill of light, upon which rests the kiss Of the unchanging day Day of the deathless host. Dark are these depths beneath; the eye in vain Attempts to probe the gloom, Corruption's awful cell, From which all beauty and all love have fled; The life-absorbing tomb, The treasure-house of dust. Fair are the heights beyond, which sweetly tell Of unextinguished love, Of reunited hearts, Unwrinkled foreheads and unweeping eyes; The tree of life above, Eternal fruit and shade! All perfect; not a wrinkle on the brow Of that wide blue serene, On which no stain can come. All lucent; not a shade across these orbs That o'er us calmly lean, And watch us in their love. 'Tis the true morning then; the night is past, And comes not back again To overshadow us. In the pure light of God, ourselves all pure, Without a shade or stain, We dwell for evermore. NIGHT HOPES. “Exurge sol purissime, Diemque da mundo suum; Nostramque noctem illuminans, Erroris umbram discute.” Buchanan (Hymnus Maintinus). The sands beneath my feet, the stars above; The waves in front, the leafy woods behind: Am I not compassed with the numberless, A unit in the vast and unconfined, 'Mid these material things, a solitary mind? Girt round about with God, in whom I live, And move, and am—my portion and my peace— I join creation's universal song, The mingled lay of rest and weariness, The varied hymn of hope, and fear, and joyfulness. For this is not the world that is to be, Though wondrous, both in darkness and in light, The fair foreshadow of the perfect earth, Freed from the mist, the tempest, and the blight, When in one joy and song all heaven and earth unite. Amid these vastnesses I stand and gaze Back on their past, as o'er a misty sea, Into their grander future, looking on And on with eager eye, more wistfully Musing on all they mean, on all they yet shall be. Common we call these things of earth and sea; I call them noble, sacred, and Divine. Man's ruins are not half so wonderful— Cathedral, temple, tower, or pillared shrine— As that old ocean-rock on which these starlets shine. Man's ruins have no ancestry compared With these unruined monuments of time, Which, ages without number, have withstood The shock of tempests and the waste of clime, Still, as when reared at first, majestic and sublime. OUR HYMN OF DELIVERANCE. (Written for the Luther Commemoration.) “Cantemus Domino; gloriose enim magnificatus est.” —Exod. xv. 21. For the Day-spring of the nations, Of the kingdoms wide and far; For the rising over Europe Of the Bright and Morning Star; For the blaze of heavenly sunshine, For the hues of glorious day, Coming up behind the shadows Of the ages long and grey— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the broken chains of Europe, For her prison-doors unbarred, For the freedom of her peoples, By the freedom-giving Word; For the battle bravely foughten With the powers of hellish night; For the scattering of the darkness, For the victory of light— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done For the ended sleep of Europe, For the rousing of her sons, For the shivering of her idols, For the ruin of their thrones; For the shout of joyous wonder As she looks around and sees The fair flag of living freedom Floating far upon the breeze— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the rainbow-beaming promise Of our Europe's better birth; For the thunder-song of gladness O'er a liberated earth; For the Book of peace unfolded, Lifted up, and set on high; For the torch of truth relighted, Nevermore to dim or die— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the franchise of the conscience, For the inner man unchained, For the intellect ennobled, And the soul's high birthright gained; For the keys of heaven recovered From the robber-hands of Rome; For the Kingdom's open gateway, And the sinner's welcome home— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the flight of ancient spectres, That had shaded with their gloom Both the castle and the cottage, Both the cradle and the tomb; For the hope of holy triumphs, In the eras yet to be; For the pledge to captive millions, Of release and jubilee— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the watchword of the prophets, That “the just shall live by faith;” For the Church's ancient symbol Of the life that comes through death; For the standard of Apostles, Raised aloft and full unfurled, Glad deliverance proclaiming To a crushed and trampled world— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the martyr's song of triumph, On the wheel or scorching pyre; For his strength of meek endurance, On the rack or torturing fire; For the noble witness-bearing To the Christ the Lamb of God, To the One unchanging Priesthood, To the One atoning blood— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the brave protest of Europe 'Gainst the iron rod of Rome, 'Gainst the old Italian spoiler, 'Gainst the wolf of Christendom; For our Europe's bold confession Of the one true faith and Lord; For the Church's bondage broken, And her ancient rights restored— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! For the everlasting Gospel, Which in splendour has gone forth, Like a torch upon the mountains, Of a re-illumined earth; For the temple flung wide open, At whose gates the goodly train Of the nations had been knocking, But in vain, so long in vain— Blessèd be God, our God, alone, Our God, the Everlasting One, Who spake the word, and it was done! September 10th, 1883. LUTHER. ‘Dixi omnia cum hominem nominavi.” —Pliny Ep. iv. 22. In the strength of conscious weakness, That leans on a strong man's arm, No shrinking, no sinking of spirit, No dread of defeat or harm: He went to the battle bravely, But he took no human sword, And he donned no earthly armour; 'Twas the battle of the Lord. In the joy of a glorious freedom, In the peace of a pardon found, In the light of a heavenly sunshine, That had compassed him around; In the life of the living Spirit, In the power of a well-known love, Went he forth on his mighty mission, At the summons from above. All the heart of Europe was heaving, Crushed out with enslaving lies; She looked all around her in anguish; He heard her bewildered cries, The cries of the death-stricken nations, Overshadowed with stifling night; He opened the Book of blessing, And the kingdoms owned its might. He shook down the leaves of healing From the boughs of Life's own tree, Till their health, with its quickening gladness, Went wide over earth and sea, Went down the rejoicing ages, Dissolving the bands of death, Diffusing a fresh, strange sweetness, With its soft celestial breath. From the banks of the turbid Tiber He heard the imperious boasts; But he faced the blustering terror In the name of the Lord of hosts, In the name of a trusted Captain That had never lost a field, And the spell of an ancient banner That never was known to yield. Like the free and impatient war-horse, That scenteth the battle afar, And shaketh the ground with its pawings, Went he forth to the unknown war. He drew no sword from the scabbard, No time-forged weapon he sought; The spear, the sword, the helmet, Were things which he needed not. He stood by the sea and touched it; Its billows were cleft in twain, He stood by the rock and smote it, Till its waters flowed amain. He stood with his rod uplifted O'er the Amalek hosts below, Till the song of the victor ascended O'er the Church's flying foe. His sling with stones from the brooklet He fills as he moves along, Alone in his deep-felt weakness, Against the ten thousand strong. A stripling in shepherd raiment, He defies the Philistian band; He comes, he sees, and he conquers, For his own fair Fatherland. He heard the shouts of the foemen; They were thousands, he but one; The legions of Rome were advancing; He stood there a lonely man. The eternal volume clasping, Heaven's rescript of life and death, He spoke the delivering watchword, That “the just shall live by faith.” He looketh around in silence; All the eagle is in his eye; Then aloud to the startled nations He lifteth his voice on high. 'Tis the voice of a fellow-mortal, Yet it comes from the Throne above; And it brings to the sorrowful peoples The bright news of celestial love. What to him were the threats of princes, Or the bribe of earthly gains? What to him was the rising tempest, Bursting down on his Saxon plains? What to him was the Roman spectre, That crossed and recrossed his path, Or the drops from the mimic vials Of the old destroyer's wrath? What to him was the seven-hilled city, Or the priest with the triple crown As he launched his envenomed curses At the monk who had braved his frown? What to him were the thunder-echoes From the far-off Apennine, The bolt of the Alpine lightning Coming down on the tranquil Rhine? Brave herald of faith and freedom, Apostle of ancient light, Oh, speak to bewildered Europe In these days of gathering night! Sound out the immortal message, Which of old her death-sleep woke; And peal the far-echoing trumpet, Which her Roman bondage broke. Though dead, art thou not still speaking? Have the ages wronged thy fame? Do we read on these princely banners But a Saxon miner's name? Is thy grand soul-stirring story But a dream of the cold, mute past? Hast thou gone from earth for ever? Are thy footprints clean effaced? Is the spell of the mighty broken? Has thy name but a myth become? Has the strength of the strong man perished? Is the voice of Luther dumb? Has the touch which thou didst kindle Passed away into hopeless gloom? Is yon bust but a block of marble, And yon grave but a vulgar tomb? Speak again to thine old Eisleben, To thy Wittenberg once more; Call aloud to the far-off millions Beyond thy old German shore. Let thy hand once more sweep over All thine old harp's varied chords; Let the nations to life awaken At the power of thy thunder-words! October, 1883.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRAGMENTS. HUMAN TEARS. All have once wept; the eye was made for tears, As the low cloud for rain; yes, all have wept, Or yet shall weep ere life's remorseless years Have o'er us with their storms and shadows swept. All have once wept; dry age and greenest prime, The strong and weak, the foolish and the wise. O ever-falling mists of shadowy time! O endless tears, that drop from human eyes! Some openly, as not ashamed to weep; Some secretly, upon the lonesome bed, When grief has battled with and conquered sleep, And memories rise, like spectres from the dead. Some from a mighty grief that cries aloud, And tells its tale with wailing unsubdued; Some from a hidden wound, which unavowed Aches secretly in lonely solitude. GONE BEFORE. They go: we weep, yet dry our tears; They die, yet die not; all is well. They leave but feebleness and fears, In immortality to dwell. Farewell, we say. Why speak we thus? Is it not well for ever there? 'Tis they should say farewell to us, Still compassed here with sin and care. They enter in; we trace their path; We follow with our eyes afar, Like one who watches as some cloud Blots from his view some sparkling star. Now nearer seems the loved unseen, Nearer the dawn for which we pray; 'Tis but a screen, a veil, a mist, Between us and that glorious day. ON THE SUDDEN DEATH OF AN INFANT. It was an undivided grief, Not broken into parts, and spread O'er long and weary months and years: Mother! thy child is dead! He did not dry up like the summer's brook Beneath the sun's absorbing ray, Which the eye watches in its slackening course, Slow-ebbing in its current, day by day. The grief was sharp, but oh, how much was spared, Even by the sharpness of the sudden blow! No nights of watching, days of hope and fear, Nor the sick weariness of lengthened woe. THE MORNING OF JOY. Out of the womb of the gloomy night Thou bringest the gladsome day; Out of the depths of the storm's dark night Thou bringest the peaceful ray. And what shall recall our earthly woe, Or what shall our peace destroy, When out of the sorrow at length shall flow The long eternal joy; When tears shall cease, and the joyous smile Shall begin these heavenly days, And the hopes and fears of this little while Shall end in the endless praise? SORROW. Led onward by the joyous ray, I thought not of the coming sorrow; Amid the brightness of to-day I dreamed not of the darker morrow. It was not till the tempest came That I my bliss began to measure; When burst the wasting thunder-flame, 'Twas then I knew my priceless treasure. It smote into life's inmost core, Each fibre of my being tearing; Leaf-like, it tossed me o'er and o'er, Then laid me down to die despairing. It turned my garden to a waste; Each stem was crushed, each flower was broken, Its fragments scattered to the blast, Its beauty gone without one token. THE TWO SEEKERS. See, the lost one seeks the Shepherd, And the Shepherd seeks the lost. Blessèd seeking, blessèd finding, After such a toil and cost! Surely 'twas not meant for me; Such a love could never be! Each the other now is seeking; Must they, shall they, can they miss? Shall the Father fail to meet him? Shall the Son mistake that kiss? Surely 'twas not meant for me; Such a love could never be! Each the other now is finding; Such a joy and such a love, Such a seeking, such a finding, Never known in heaven above. Surely 'twas not meant for me; Such a love could never be! CONFESSION. There never came an emptier soul to Thee, Never, never! All want, and weariness, and sin, Evil without me and within. To Thee, O Lord, I flee, I flee; Wilt Thou say nay to me? There never came a darker soul to Thee, Never, never! 'Tis night with me in every part, The mind, the conscience, and the hear O Light of life, to Thee I flee; Canst thou say nay to me? “ONCE OFFERED TO BEAR THE SINS OF MANY.” Heb. ix. 28. He died the death we should have died, The death which only He could die Who is the Holy and the Just, The Christ, the Son of God most high. O blessèd death, that won our life, And brought us from a grave of sin; O loving death, that opened wide The gate, and drew us sweetly in; O mighty death, that conquered death And did for us the kingdom win! LIFE'S SHADOWS. Ere life's last shadows lengthen out, Ere thy fair sky grow dim, Ere the dread darkness falls on thee, Acquaint thyself with Him! 'Tis all thou needest, child of time, To make a heaven of earth's low clime. Nearer the setting sun thou art, Nearer the silent brim Of the lone stream which thou must cross: Acquaint thyself with Him! 'Tis all thou needest, child of sin, To make a heaven thy soul within. ARISE, AND COME AWAY. Cant. ii. 10-12. He speaketh from the throne: “Behold, I come!” He speaketh to His own, Long sleeping in the tomb: “Arise, my love, my fair one; Arise, and come away.” The winter now is past; The spring is come; The turtle's tender voice Is now no longer dumb: “Arise, my love, my fair one; Arise, and come away.” PARAPHRASE OF ISAIAH LX. 19, 20. That sun thou shalt not need, Nor ask his light again; The Lord shall be a light to thee, Thy God thy glory then. Thy moon shall wane no more, Nor shall thy sun descend; Done all thy years of sighs and tears, Thy mourning at an end. THE FLIGHT OF TIME. The stars are still above us, And the green earth below; The mountains wear their helmets Of everlasting snow; But years are rushing past us, Like storm across the main, And the moments fall around us, Like drops of morning rain. Our summer dreams are over, With their bewitching spells, And autumn's fading foliage A soberer lesson tells. A CHURCHYARD BY THE SEA. Only the turf is green; All round is wild and bare; O life and resurrection, come, To make all fair! The wave sends up its spray Upon the broken wall; O Stiller of the breaking wave, Speak when we call! The long grass moves and bends, As sighing o'er the dead; No flower above the graves Waves its luxuriant head. The white moss sheathes the stone, Effacing each old line; The nettle spreads its shade across; The brambles intertwine. Far round on every side Spreads the low, level sand, While inland far a mountain peak Keeps sentry o'er the land. SUNRISE. The day came freshly up, and spread itself In living loveliness o'er land and sea; All summer's silver song was in the air, The song of stream, and wood, and hill, and tree. My soul took in the music and the peace; The beauty round me seemed to come from heaven; The fragrance of the breathing air poured in Like love from God Himself, all gladly given. SUNSET ON THE SEA. Between the mainland and the isle The quiet wavelets brightly gleam; Above them shines the silken sky, As tranquil as a happy dream. With heavens all blue, and earth all green, Oh, could there be a fairer scene? How peacefully along the wave, How tranquilly beneath the blue, Stealeth along the silent bark, With its young, loving, smiling crew! While from its twilight home afar Comes slowly forth each autumn star. TO P. S. C. G. The love that passeth knowledge, The peace that never dies, The life that hath no ending, The joy beyond the skies; The sun whose light is gladness, And knoweth no decline, The day that hath no sadness: May these, my child, be thine! On sea or land thy Keeper, He who for thee hath died; His loving arm around thee, His brightness at thy side; Beneath His cross to rest thee, In His fair light to shine, Upon His strength to lean thee: All these, my child, be thine! June, 1874.</field>
