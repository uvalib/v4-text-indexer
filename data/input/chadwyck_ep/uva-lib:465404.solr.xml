      <field name="fulltext">INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. The Invocation, and Introduction.—Health is the greatest blessing of mankind.—It should be the chief aim of parents to procure their children the enjoyment of it.—Nature and instinct therefore are to be followed.—Pernicious custom of giving children some drug soon after they are born.—The best remedy, at that time, is the first milk of the mother.— Various reasons and motives for the mother's suckling her children.—An amiable duty.—Apostrophe to tender affection. —Directions how to choose a nurse, if the mother cannot perform that office herself.—Cities destructive to infants.— Recommendation of the country.—The mother should oversee the conduct of the nurse.—The nurse's usual manner of life should be altered as little as possible.—Address to Habit. Celestial Maid! from genuine science sprung! Thee the pretended sage, whose leaden eye Inwrapt in metaphysic gloom, ne'er deigns A cheerful smile, thee with contracted brow, And haughty gesture, all his vassals shun: While by the Graces drest, Instruction hails Thy guiding care. Celestial maid attend! Tho barren be the subject, o'er its wilds So may a verdure not their own be shed, And blooming flowers. With me then turn thy sight On the prime infant-state of helpless man: On the first dawn of life, when nature now Ushers her tender offspring into day; Observe the young ideas how they wake In gradual order, till at length matured By time, they speak a living soul within. View too the transient flash of mirth; the ills Not real, yet afflictive; the quick thought For ever varying, glanced from toy to toy. Then constant motion pleases, then the ear Catches at every sound, the eye untired Darts its wild ray, and every object thrills The new-born sense with joy. Come Virgin, teach How on the government of these first years Depends the future man; no vulgar theme, No fruitless task, experiencing thy aid. We write to reason: Hence ye doating train Of midwives and of nurses ignorant! Old beldames grey, in error positive, And stiff in prejudice, whose fatal care Oft death attends, or a life worse than death. O Youth, whoe'er thou art, to beauty's charms A slave, to all that inexpressive grace Which native modesty and truth bestow On their more beauteous minds, and which exalts Britannia's daughters o'er the female world! Is thy beloved propitious? Doth the god Kindle his nuptial torch? And dost thou wish The name of father, amiable, humane? To view thy little progeny around Happy, well-formed, and strong? Attend the muse: The instructive muse shall teach thee to obtain Thy heart's desire. And say, wilt thou fair nymph, Complacent heed with favourable eye The moral lay, refined and pure? To thee Custom hath given, while active life shall call Thy husband forth amid its boist'rous walks, Domestic rule: thine is the nursery's charge; Important trust! from him what absence hides, Thy constant anxious care shall well supply. Health is the greatest blessing man receives From bounteous heaven; by her the smiling hours Are wing'd with transport; she too gives the soul Of firmness; without her, the hand of toil Would languid sink; the eye of reason fade. To this then bend thy care, O parent mind; Array thy child in health; a nobler dress Not gorgeous majesty can boast; the thanks Of future gratitude thou wilt receive, More than around him from thy treasured hoard Then showering sums profuse; or giving all Thy herds, and bleating flocks; tho thousands range Thy spacious meads, or cloath thy ample hills. Would'st thou thy children blest? The sacred voice Of nature calls thee; where she points the way Tread confident. No labyrinth is here; No clue of Ariadne wilt thou need, To Theseus given; fair is her open path, And strong the steady light she casts around, Instinctive light, the surest safest guide. Thy child is born. See, where the treacherous nurse, Or priestess of Lucina, in her hand The ready medicine brings! Forewarned, beware; Within the fatal drug lurks death; by this, Thousands from yet untasted life retire, Thousands of infant souls; yet sanctified By custom, other reasons are assign'd, And nature is accused of impious deeds She ne'er committed. Nature will preserve Whate'er she frames: and what the child requires In his new state, sagaciously provides, Both food and remedy: Before the sun Hath from his birth encircled half the sphere, He asks, plain as expressive signs can ask, The mother's breast: Without a moment's pause Hear the mute voice of instinct and obey. Know the first efflux from the milky fount Is nature's chymic mixture, which no power Of art presumptuous can supply; this flows Gently detersive, purifying, bland; This each impediment o'ercomes, and gives The young, unfetter'd springs of life to play. Hence too the mother is secure: The streams, Her infant's health promoting, flow to her Salubrious; otherwise confined, or urged Back to their source, what evils may she dread! Sickness, and giddy languor, shivering cold, And heat alternate, dire obstructions, pangs Of sharpest torture, cancers, by the juice Of boasted hemlock not to be removed. O Mother (let me by that tenderest name Conjure thee) still pursue the task begun; Nor unless urged by strong necessity, Some fated, some peculiar circumstance, By which thy health may suffer, or thy child Inhale disease, or that the genial food Too scanty flows, give to an Alien's care Thy orphan babe. Oh! if by choice thou dost— What shall I call thee? woman? No, tho fair Thy face, and deckt with unimagined charms Tho sweetness seem pourtray'd in every line, And smiles which might become a Hebe, rise At will, crisping thy rosy cheeks, though all That's lovely, kind, attractive, elegant, Dwell in thy outward shape, and catch the eye Of gazing rapture, all is but deceit; The form of woman's thine, but not the soul. Had'st thou been treated thus, perchance the prey Of death long since, no child of thine had known An equal lot severe. O unblown flower! Soft bud of spring! Planted in foreign soil, How wilt thou prosper! Brush'd by other winds In a new clime, and fed by other dews Than suit thy nature! From a stranger hand Ah, what can infancy expect, when she Whose essence was inwove with thine, whose life, Whose soul thou didst participate, neglects Herself in thee, and breaks the strongest seal Which nature stamp'd in vain upon her heart. O luckless Babe, born in an evil hour! Who shall thy numerous wants attend? explore The latent cause of ill? thy slumbers guard? And when awake, with nice sedulity Thy every glance observe? A parent might; A hireling cannot; though of blameless mind, Tho conscious duty prompt her to the task, She feels not in her breast the impulsive goad Of instinct, all the fond, the fearful thoughts Awakening: say, at length that habit's power Can something like maternal kindness give, Yet, ere that time, may the poor nursling die. Besides, who can assure the lacteal springs Clear, and untainted? Oft disorder lurks Beneath the vivid bloom, and cheerful eye, Promising health; and poisonous juice secrete, Slow undermining life, stains what should be The purest nutriment. Hence, worse than death, Long years of misery to thy blasted child. A burthen to himself, by others shunn'd, He wishes for the grave, and wastes his days In solitary woe; or haply weds, And propagates the hereditary plague; Entailing on his name the bitter curse Of generations yet unborn, a race Pithless, and weak, of faded texture wan; Like some declining plant, with mildew'd leaves, Whose root a treacherous insect gnaws unseen. But, whether lost in pleasure, in the round Of modish life, and dissipation gay, Misnamed polite, the welfare of her child The fair barbarian looks on with an eye Distant, and cold; or imitating her, As faults of higher station always gain Partial abettors, the neglected muse Hath to the parent in life's middle rank Tuned her unfructuous lay; she shall not cease Desponding, weightier arguments for them, More strenuous, more coercive she can bring, To which perhaps self-interested love Will ope their listening sense. Of mental joys And pure delight,they would not understand, Or relish the description. But if health They covet, nor before the genial prime Wish the stern fates to cut their vital thread, Those hearts may prove susceptible of fear, Which instinct, love, and duty could despise. Nor seek we fabled incidents, to strike With superstitious dread the mind, but truth, Plain, honest truth, inspires the homely song. She who refuses to her young one's lip Her swelling bosom, each returning year Conceives, and each returning year sustains The pangs of child-birth. Harass'd by fatigue, The strongest constitution droops; but soon The weaker system, like a blighted flower, Falls underneath the shock. The nursing time Was meant by wisest nature, as a stay, A vacant interspace, in which the nerves, And threads of life unstrung, might re-assume Their native tone, endued again with strength, And corresponding freedom, to support The day of toil: as a sure medicine, To root out many an illness, else unquell'd, From the soft female frame: to invigorate The fragile texture, and with grateful force Astringe the fibres, morbid and relax'd. But if not e'en these motives can persuade; To improve her charms, new beauties to possess, Is woman's utmost wish. Mark then the fair, Who to this sweet employment turns her mind! Delighted health sits on her polish'd brow, And shews the veins beneath; Spreads o'er her cheek The vermil glow; her eyes with lustre fills; Decks her with radiant smiles, and all her form With grace ineffable, and comeliness Invests. Enough of these—The muse beholds With rapture some of other kind—Oh! hail Ye real mothers! Ye whose hearts are full Of sensibility! Who, highly pleased, Would not, for all the gewgaws pride can boast, Loosen the magic knot, which joins in one Your babes and you; or see a hireling share The love, which to a mother sole belongs. O Thou, to whom, one of this pious train, I with esteem and veneration bend! Lead on with decent step, uncheck'd by fear, To those domestic haunts, where peace expands Her wings, and harmony delighted dwells. Let me behold thee rivet thy fix'd eye On the young infant form, then press it close, Close to thy throbbing heart, then on its lips A thousand kisses print, thy eyes with joy O'erflowing, in each feature nicely scann'd, Tracing the dear resemblance of its sire. And lo! where pleased, beyond expression pleased, To see thee in the sweetest task employ'd Of female duty, where thy husband hangs O'er thee enamour'd! Scarcely did the night Which gave thee to his arms, bestow a joy To this superior; thrilling to the mind, Sincere, and home-felt. O true name of love, Tender Affection! Genuine source of bliss Immaculate, and pure! The transient blaze Of passion soon subsides, thy steadier fire Time but increases! Soft coercive band, Connecting souls! Without thee, what is life! Mild Halcyon of the breast, whose summer wing Calms every raging storm! To thee the wise, The good still offer incense; all who bear No sordid stains; nor any but the dull, Or grovelling, in her parsimonious mood By nature form'd, or whom with iron hand Tyrannic custom rules, despise thy sway Thrice happy she, by inclination led, By nought with-held, to add this pleasing link, This heart-endearing bond, to the sweet ties Of married love! But should'st thou e'er be doom'd, Votaress of truth and virtue, to resist The attractive warmth by their eternal hands Implanted; to resist the liberal call Of duty and desire; condemned by ails From causes unforseen, to tear the pledge From thy fond bosom; while thy sickening heart Bleeds at the thought, condemn'd another's care To invoke for him, the babe, thy straining eyes Gaze on with nameless pleasure: Let my lay Direct thy choice for the momentous task Whom to retain, what parent to adopt For thy unconscious young one; for from her Not only nutriment perhaps he takes, To life and growth subservient, but who knows How far the stamina yet unevolved, How far the soul herself as yet unformed, For texture, vigour, passions, intellect, On this thy act depend? Far from the bounds Of the rank city, let some trusty mind Explore the straw-rooft cott; there, firm of nerve Her blood from every grosser particle, By hardy labour, and abstemious fare, Sublimed; the honest peasant's mate shall ope Her hospitable arms, receive with joy The infant stranger, and profusely yield Her pure balsamic nurture to his lip. But since the keenest eye may be deceived, And vice will lurk amid the country haunts To innocence devoted, it were meet To investigate among the village Tribe Their neighbour's mode of life. Heeds she the laws Of matron-like sobriety? Her fame, Is it from all suspicion clear? Her soul, To wedlock true? Feels she a parent's love? To her own offspring tenderly benign? Does she her husband's constant heart possess? Nor seeks he foreign pleasure? Every doubt Extinguish'd here; still curiously persist, Nor terminate thy search; examine round Her little mansion, see if there, in spite Of poverty, the step of cleanliness, Attractive nymph, unhesitating treads. Her age too claims thy notice; let not time On restless wing have stolen from her face The bloom of youth, nor be she green in years. For torpid, or impaired by frequent use, The flexile vessels which, convolved in maze Wrapp'd within maze, secrete the purer stream, Their office will more sparingly perform, Or less nutritious particles supply. And if thy nurse be young, the thoughtful mind Of prudence would not to her charge confide What claims exactest assiduity, And serious vigilance. There are who think, Too subtile in their theory, the nurse Should with the mother aptly coincide In age and temperament; but heeding well The precepts we have given, thou may'st neglect Such trivial niceness; health from each extreme Removed, is not to colour of the hair, Or to complexion tinged with red or brown Confined: excess thou should'st indeed avoid Of plump or lean, nor would I choose the adust And highly bilious, or the sable hue Of clouded melancholy. Be it then Thy primal care to fix on vigorous health Adorn'd with smiles, the lovely progeny Of constant cheerfulness, and sweet content. Nor would I (tho confest a quality Inferior in it's kind) not prize the voice From harshness free, whose soft tone can compose The froward babe, or gently bid it wake, And view the young-eyed morn. O thou, who help'st To throng the crowded town, restrain'd by force Within that court of death, where every gale Is tainted with pollution; did the muse, If some sad cause forbade thee to pursue, The mother's genuine office, to the fields Serene, and rural Lares, order forth Thy tender infant? not from needless fears And vain precaution, did she dare to thwart The dictates of humanity. She sees, What do not to thy eye perhaps appear, The dreadful train of ills, which swarm within The unhallow'd precincts. Well she knows how few Out of the many myriads city-born Survive, in just proportion scann'd with those Who bask in freer day. Yet, much avails A parent's unabating love, and sharp Is absence to the soul. But can'st thou purge The unwholesome atmosphere, gravid with seeds Of latent sickness? Suffocation fell, Angina, apthous sores, eruptions dire, Pertussis fierce, and squalid atrophy? Say, can'st thou bid the flagging south speed by, Nor stagnant, o'er his much-loved mansion brood With darkening plume, of poison and of death Prolific? When each danger I review, Shudd'ring with fear, I scarce would bid thee prove The nurse's task, tho nought should intervene Of fatal accident, and thou art bound By every tie of nature to the deed. For can'st thou round thy infant's brow entwine A magic wreath? Or cause an angel lift His shielding arm? Thou can'st not: follow then The precepts of experience; yet let oft Maternal fondness guide thee to the place Where rests the little sojourner, there view How cherish'd, how improved, and lingering chide The rapid step of still-progressive time, Which hurries thee reluctantly away. But can the mother change unblamed the town, For some sequester'd villa? What denies, Her bed of sickness quitted, to retreat And seek the haunts, where peace on flowers reclined Lists to the warbling songster of the grove? Or from the gently-rising hill surveys The grazing herds, and rivulet which winds Meand'ring thro the distant vale? Where health Sports on the level green, and young delight Smiling attends: Where bounteous nature sheds Her choicest blessings, and with guardian wing Protects her favourite progeny. Retire, My fair disciple, haste to scenes like these, And underneath thy roof invite to dwell The fosterer of thy child. Despise, with me, The insipid train of vanity and pride; The foppery of custom; quaint parade Of ceremonial visit; idle farce Of masquerade, or ball, where real joy Ne'er entered; conversations gayly dull, Unblest by exiled friendship; glare of courts; And mummery of the great. Be't thine to walk With reason, and enjoy the harmonious voice Of conscious rectitude, whose soothing strain Can lift the soul beyond what vulgar thought Can distantly imagine. If thou must Require another's aid thy place to fill, Her conduct thou direct, and regulate The manner of her life, a pleasure this Inferior, yet affording ample room To gratify the finer nerve of love. To see thy substitute at stated times The life-sustaining food supply, to mark How thrives her young dependent, and each day Appears addition manifest to gain In size and stature, while his eyes beam forth, At least to fancy's peering search, the dawn Of future reason, and intelligence. Here, as in all things, nature opens wide Her page instructive. Did'st thou not behold How in her homely dwelling, health imbued With roseate tint the cheeks, and firmly strung The muscles of her elder boy thy nurse Hath left behind? She was not surfeited With dainty cates, and high luxurious fare When him she suckled; never did a draught Stronger than water pass her thirsty lip; Pernicious ale she knew not. When released From short confinement, to her various wants No friend, no servant minister'd; her babe She fill'd, then gave up to the soft embrace Of sleep; meanwhile no sedentary life She led, she spun the woof, in order meet She set her cott, the viands she prepared, With which at even-tide to welcome home The husband whom she loved: Or in her arms Bearing her grateful burthen, out she hied, Braving the summer's heat, or winter's cold, And as she walk'd, caroll'd the incondite lay Of rustic merriment. Seek not to change Her usual regimen, for if thou dost, Should she escape the fever which impends, Expect thy child, attack'd by cholic pangs, To writhe in torture, or perhaps at once Convulsions fierce shall snatch him from the world. For now her stomach, which from diet hard, By habit's force, and potent exercise Elaborated chyle of blandest sort, Oppress'd by crudities, corrupts the blood With viscid recrement. Or else the brain, That source of motion, urged by sympathy, Creates new impulses of morbid kind The vital threads affecting, and from thence The elastic arteries, and ruddy stream Within their coats contain'd, the different glands Their various store secreting, nor escapes Among the rest the lacteal tide, the food, By nature, of thy child, but now his bane. O habit! powerful ruler of mankind! Great principle of action! Reconciled By thee to every clime, the human race O'erspread this globe; around the frozen pole Scorn the stern brow of winter, nor beneath The equator's torrid influence, dread the shafts Of vengeful Phœbus; thou presidest well-pleased Over the innocuous vegetable meal, Which on the banks of Ganges, or of Ind, Satiates the temperate Bramin. Thou can'st tame To wholesome nourishment the sanguine feast Of the ever-roving Scythian. To thy laws We subjugate the willing neck, profest Thy vassals; nor the mental faculties Dost thou not sway; by thee inwrapt in maze Of subtle politics, the statesman plans His fraudful schemes unceasing. Thou sustain'st The sage who labours for the public good With patriot care, though oftentimes assail'd By black ingratitude. The midnight lamp Of meditation, trimm'd by thee, reveals To keen philosophy truth's awful face, And all his toil is pleasure. Led by thee, The bard retreats from vice's noisy reign, And in the secret grot with fancy holds Delicious converse, while her hand withdraws The veil from memory's ideal store, And all the associated tribe of thought Displays before his view. Still may I bend Before thy shrine, O Habit, when thy rules With nature's disagree not, neither then May we unpunish'd break them, else in vain Shalt thou attempt to fasten round my heart; For know, that reason, and her sister form, Fair virtue, can untwist thy magic cords, And to their will, tho not annihilate, Can all thy laws attemper and refine. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. Introduction, and address to humanity and simplicity.—Importance of the subject.—Nursery, not unworthy the notice of fathers.—Aliment of infants.—Milk, the only provision of nature.—Folly of giving them various kinds of food, and especially of feeding them by night.—Additional food when infants gain the age of two months.—Not to be fed in such a quantity, as that their stomachs may reject the aliment.— Apology for mothers being led into error.—Description of prejudice in general.—Mothers should strive against its power.—Ill effects of repletion, even in grown persons.— Nature to be satisfied, not over-loaded.—Healthy appearance of children temperately brought up, and pleasing prospect of their future behaviour in life by that means.— Weakly children, though sometimes of quick apprehensions, not likely to perform the active duties of life.—The Storgè, or natural affection of parents to their offspring, may be carried to excess.—Weaning.—The fittest time when children are about nine months old.—Before this, proper to accustom them to other food.—Vegetables alone, the cause of many complaints to children.—Importance of the female character. Are there with pride elate, who cast a glance Of supercilious scorn on strains like these, Stiling them low? While sweet humanity Attentive listens, vain the cynic sneer, Or cynic frown. She, her warm cheek suffused With blushes sprung from conscious virtue, owns She thinks no task too mean, no work too low, Whose end is public good; would save a life, Rather than deck herself in glittering robes, And boast of titled honours; sooner give One ornament to grace the common-weal, Than purchase a whole empory of wit. Come modest dame, and o'er my numbers meek Preside; come with simplicity, who hates The swelling phrase bombast, the insipid term Pompously introduced, as artists vile O'er forms uncouth their dazzling colours spread, And mock the eye: she too shall bid the train Of haughty ignorance (for 'tis the curse Of pride to be with ignorance conjoined) Keep far aloof, nor read the hallow'd lay. Yet not alone to women do we write, The nurse or mother. Subjects such as these Oft have the sages old of Greece or Rome In studious mood employed; full well they knew That from the birth those heroes must be form'd, Whom Athens might with future joy admire Or hardy Sparta: Heroes who might urge To their sublimest pitch the rights of men, Brave every danger for their country's cause, And make the Persian tremble, though inclosed By countless millions: Heroes who might act Deeds which the Gracchi would not blush to own, Or Scipio, bravest, noblest of mankind. Themes such as these employ'd the generous soul Of Locke, when with the patriot spirit fired Of Plato of Lycurgus, He assay'd The manly task, from custom's harpy claws, And the soft lap of luxury, to snatch The Babe to enervate idleness foredoom'd, Or sickly languor; to connect his mind With vigorous organs, its impulsive will Apt to perform, and run with ease and strength The great and difficult career of life; Desirous to behold our British Youth Out-rival ancient fame. Come then ye sires, Whom love of offspring, or of country sways! You will approve my verse; the nursery's care From you will gain attention. Wisdom's voice, And deep philosophy to you have taught Its consequence, and worth. Oh! aid the toil Of a fond mother, with your reason guide Her gentler faculties; invigorate Her virtuous weakness; to your well-known voice She will, she cannot but with pleasure yield, And follow precepts sanctified by you. What aliment the tender babe requires, How best sustain'd, the muse proceeds to sing. To nature then attend: she hath prepared No food but milk alone, and if it flows In plenteous rills, abundant is the store. Thus fed, the lamb over the grassy turf Sports frolicksome; the patient ox who turns Sweltering all day the stubborn glebe, by this Nourish'd at first, his present strength acquired. And will thy infant cease to thrive, supplied With this nepenthe? Rather he will gain New vigour every hour, and healthful smile Tho sickness scoul around. Yet some there are Who fill from morn to noon, from noon to eve, Nay thro the hours of night, the suffering child With various cates, heedless of nature's lore, Cruelly kind, unknowing that they thus Fatten a victim for the hungry grave. For from repletion, every ill severe Which threatens childhood, arm'd with keener force, Invades the delicate frame. How oft 'twere fit The suckling should imbibe the milky stream, From the first dawn of morning, till the sun Set in the west, experience must evince. All do not feed alike, some greedily Drain at a meal the lacteal beverage, Others more nice require the frequent treat. Yet when night spreads her mantle o'er the globe, And leads on sleep and silence, it is meet To obey her mandate; rest thy careful head O mother, let thy tender nurseling rest. Why wilt thou anxious to thyself create Unnecessary pain? At evening close Forth from her den starts the fell lioness, And thro the gloomy desart urges on Eager for prey her rapid step, she leaves Her sleeping young one, nor expects he food Till she return with morning's early beam. Yet this is he, who shall hereafter reign Lord of the forest, and with kingly voice Appal his listening subjects. But thy heart Is soft, and cannot bear thy infant's cries. Oh! Heaven forbid that I should with thy breast Steel'd to his real misery! But these Are cries which evil custom hath begot, And blind indulgence; unalarm'd sustain A few short trials, bear unmoved the shock At first; indulged not, he will fret no more. Believe me, nor from hunger, nor from pain These wailings spring. How different is the shriek, And agonizing groan, from sobs like these, Transient, and humorsome! To cloath thy child With health some little violence endure: Nor to the dictates plain of candid truth Thy ancient nurse's doating saws prefer. The stomach ever full, is ever weak: But from refreshing sleep and abstinence Digestion thrives, and kindliest nutriment The absorbent veins inhale, wherewith the warm And plastic arteries by due degrees Upbuild the human fabric; or by which Each slender thread and fibre is evolved, Gaining mysteriously their destined bulk, And firm elastic motion. Robb'd of sleep The warrior droops his head, and longs no more To plunge amid the fight: The rustic faints, Vigorous e'erwhile, nor strains his sinewy arms Holding the plough, but nerveless and unmann'd Presses his homely pallet, sending forth Vain wishes to the power who from him flies. And can the gentle frame of woman bear Constant disturbance and unrest? Her strength Melts down apace, the bloom forsakes her cheeks, A peevish listlessness succeeds, she pines, And over-sedulous is now unfit To fill that office which she most desires. Would'st Thou thy child to pass the hours of night Wrapt in sleep's downy plumage? Banish far The lazy cradle, useless but to give Relief to the indolent attendant race, Who fain would batten in perpetual sloth, Who shrink at slightest toil, and ill deserve The viands they devour. At first indeed, During the circuit of a moon or twain 'Tis fit thy charge should only eat and sleep; Nature demands it. Afterward contract The hours of sleep by day, and in the embrace Of carefulness let exercise divert The lively infant; chiefly when his eye Now looks around unknowing what he sees, Now when he springs, and spreads his little arms, And smiles, and utters sounds which strike thine ear With wondrous pleasure. Tho we now permit Some added food, its quality regard, As of important consequence. We praise Above the rest, the farinaceous tribe, Bread well-fermented, unadulterate With deleterious alum, this with milk And with the limpid element decoct. Yet always mindful of the golden mean, Be even this with moderation used, Nor ever glut the stomach till it loathes, And the superfluous aliment rejects. The wrinkled Sibyl laugh to scorn, and all Her dreams fallacious, when pronouncing this A sign of health. Nature indeed is kind, And various her attempts to evacuate What would be noxious, and 'tis well thy child Hath still sufficing strength. But he, poor babe, Had he the sense to guide his appetite, Would shun this consequence of mere excess, No proof of health, disgustful to the eye. We blame thee not for yielding to the voice Of error; if beneath the solemn garb Of old experience hid, and self-convinced, Not meaning to deceive, how should thy young Untutor'd mind resist her lore? But when Truth meets thy sight, and pointing shews the way To nature's bower, thy blind associate quit, Enter the hallow'd shade, converse with her Pure nymph, peruse her lineaments divine, And to her voice impartial ope thy heart. It is not strange that prejudice should gain Access to thy soft bosom. Who can boast His freedom? Wide and potent is her sway. No fiend in stronger bonds hath held enslaved The groaning nations. In Cimmerian gloom, Where light ne'er penetrates, but darkness sits In fixt essential majesty enthroned, Unconscious sloth, by ignorance compress'd, Brought forth this monster. To the haunts of men Taking her way, the stars grew pale; her wings She spread incumbent o'er the subject world, Nor suffered men to view what slender bounds Divided them from brutes; in torpid state Plunged deep, they lay supine for many an age, Till Ægypt first rebell'd: mother of arts, And boasted fount of wisdom. Yet, tho bold The adventure, she to burst the galling chain Strove unsuccessful. Mid the twilight groves Of sacred Memphis, on the banks of Nile, Prolific, wondrous stream, or round the walls Of hundred-gated Thebes, in union close With superstition, dwelt the pest abhorr'd; And underneath her hieroglyphic veil Incongruous forms commingled. Nor in Greece Reign'd she less absolute; her sages hence Built their fallacious systems, airy shades, And phantoms of the brain; with wordy war Fought in defence each of his waking dream, And suffer'd truth with Socrates to expire. How long beneath her power did Europe bend! Prompted by her, ambition eagle-wing'd Taught ancient Rome amid the lust of sway, Intent on crimson conquest, to neglect Humanity and virtue; till the pile By valour rear'd, fell from it's giddy height, Shatter'd within by luxury, without Assail'd by savage fierceness. Then what depth Of native gloom, of thick-incircling night, Witness'd her presence! Every art was lost, Each effort of the mind; or else sunk low Crouch'd to the yoke; while o'er the puzzled schools Exalted, shook his worse than iron rod The tyrant Stagyrite; and physic awed By Galen's sullen genius dared not heal. Each lovelier grace, each elegance unknown, Each genuine ornament, till taste o'erwhelm'd With death-like sleep, in Leo's age revived. Philosophy extinct, till Bacon rose The morning star of science, by whose beams Transfixt, as erst the fabled Python fell, Lay vanquish'd huge authority. Then first Experiment with radiant lamp disclosed The stores of bigot time, and taught with nice Laborious hand from each fictitious gem To separate the true. Hence day by day The rigid shackles fall self-loosed, or brace Mankind less strictly; we for nature's laws Read nature only; wisdom smiles serene, With freedom bless'd, and fools alone are slaves. And say wilt Thou in this enlightened age O Mother, single stand, and lend thine ear To hoar, and quaint tradition? Wilt thou treat Thy Child by their opinion, whose advice Thou would'st not follow in one act besides? Judge by thyself. What languor, what fatigue Attends the fuller meal! What dire effects, What tumults oft from the crude surfeit rise! And why is reason thine, if not with care To govern him whose yet unripen'd frame Of sense is vacant? Tho with greater ease, His stomach may the superplus expel, Than older gluttony; yet caution dreads Events unfortunate, the nerves convulsed, Fever, and each ill symptom which attends The growing teeth. Unskill'd to curb himself, His appetite guide thou: So, duly fed, Each meal affording what may satisfy, Not burthen nature, on thy happy child Hygeia shall with eye propitious look. His shall be comely vigour, winning smiles, Freedom from pain, protection from disease, And stamina well-knit to undergo Each future change of ever-varying life, Each toil, each danger, nay perhaps a base On which hereafter may be firmly rear'd Each virtue, social, public, warm, refined, Each intellectual, moral excellence. For tho the child of weaker nerves may seem With quickest parts endow'd, yet should he rise Thro numerous perils to the height of man, Oppress'd with listless torpor, how can he Brave the meridian ray of public life? Reflecting on himself, how shall his mind Expand toward other's feelings? Nay too oft Those blossoms immature of sense, on which We gaze with pleasure and astonishment, Spontaneous from the blighted stalk descend, Or yield harsh tasteless fruit. This stroke severe Thou shalt avoid, more rationally kind. If form'd by nature delicate, thy love Guided by judgment, shall his strength improve; At least his weakness, or the effects it brings, Shall not proceed from errors of thy own. Thou wilt not gorge thy child; and all night long He sleeps serene, an interval of rest, In which the stomach clear'd of every load Fortuitous, its healthful state preserves. He wakes alert, prompted by hunger keen To imbibe the draught nutritious. Thee too sleep Hath charm'd with opiate rod; no froward cries, No tortures of thy infant, caused by crude, Unwholesome, or accumulated fare, Have broke thy tranquil slumbers. Thou too seest Placid the break of morn, and to thy babe The well-secreted, copious aliment Preparest to give; which, sad anxiety And restless hours, (in her, who idly fond, And painfully solicitous, hath watch'd The night, for other purposes design'd) Rob of its balmy essence, else derived Sprightly and plenteous from the genial chyle, A weak, thin, vapid, unsubstantial juice; Whence to the tender organs of her babe A morbid irritation, which destroys Their natural, and necessary tone, Till haply dire disease, or death ensues. Is there a stronger principle infix'd In human nature, than the zealous warmth A mother toward her infant feels? Yet thin Is the barrier dividing right from wrong, Virtue from vice. The noblest qualities Indulged to excess, a different hue assume, No longer noble. Courage may be changed To brutal force; to prodigality The generous sentiment; to licence rude Freedom's bright flame; and tender nuptial love To mean uxoriousness. What finer joys Inspire the soul more exquisitely form'd By vulgar minds unheeded! But beware Lest sensibility itself, uncheck'd, Extinguish its delights; lest pity bleed At every pore, intolerable smart Enduring; lest the softer passion urge If unsuccessful, to the wan abode Of madness or despair; lest taste exact Turn to fastidious niceness, coveting With vain desire, among the works of men, To find perfection. Thou too curb thy zeal O Mother, that impulsive ardour rule, That love inordinate, which urges on To weakness, and perverts to criminal The sweetest, best emotions of thy soul. Whence is this nameless energy? this power So forcibly attractive? who intwined Its subtile threads? and round the willing heart Braced firm the cord mysterious? Who, but He! The prime intelligence! Who first call'd forth From warring Chaos this fair frame of things! Who bade each part with animation glow! And what he will'd to exist, in order due Not of continued, but successive life Will'd to preserve. Who taught the winged race Among impervious shades, with matchless skill, To form their nests, and guard their callow brood. The natives of the fields, and desart wilds, A fit retreat to seek, the rocky cave, Thicket, or mountain high. Who gives them all A thousand wiles, a thousand stratagems Of crafty policy, from hostile force To save their young; and to defend them, fills E'en the most timid with impetuous strength, And sense of prowess never felt before. Instinct alone, their tutoress and guide; But instinct and superior reason thine. Thus while nine moons have known increase and wane Taught to proceed, the pleasing task of care Is still unfinish'd, much remains unsung. Now is the season by experience deem'd Most meet, an arduous duty to attempt. Arduous to some; but not to thee, whose mind Reason enlightens with a clearer ray, Shewing the bounds between parental love, And its fond foolish mimic. Thou canst look Beyond the present, no dull slave of sense, And for a lasting good, most willingly Endure some transient pain. Thy child long time Fed by thy vital fluid, now requires Dismission from the breast. Yet not at once, As some have taught erroneous; such our frame That every rash and sudden change may prove The source of harm. More wise and cautious Thou Break thro the tye of habit by degrees; And ere the stream maternal be refused, His taste to different nutriment incline. Besides the increase of food ere while allow'd What diet do we grant? Some would defer To years more vigorous, all, that tyrant man, The universal glutton, from the race That grazes on the plain, or skims the flood, Or cleaves with nimble wing the yielding air, Culls for his use; and would not that the child Should taste of ought but what the fruitful earth, Plant, herb, or grain produces, with the stream The lowing kine afford. There are no doubt Who to the latest stage of life arrive, Thus always nourish'd. On the shores of Ind Check'd by religious fears, whole tribes refuse To bathe their hands in blood, left thro the wound A kindred soul should fly; yet some pass through A century of years (so fame reports) By sickness unsubdued. Where high ascend Our Caledonian hills, the hardy north A gallant offspring boasts, whom fate denies To indulge, except in vegetable meals. Yet when their country rouses them to arms, Waving her standard to their view, they rush Impetuous forth, and terrible in war, Dread as the Lion hurt, in every clime They fight, they conquer, hearing but their name The distant foe grows pale. Yet prone to doubt, The sage these fair examples will not trust, Implicitly believing. He will judge Not from a race of men by habit sway'd, By custom harden'd, not from every rare Occurrence of longevity; or those, The Minions of their clan, who seek the fields Where rages fell Bellona. He requires A strict impartial list, to know if more Of these, compared with others, ere the force Of potent use hath nature's influence changed, Escape unhurt, and reach life's grateful prime Active, proportion'd, vigorous. And here, These distant facts still undetermined left, The instructive Muse shall teach from what her eyes Have clearly seen; though social, not inclined To luxury's various table, though humane, No follower of the Samian Sect. Howe'er The infant form'd perhaps with stronger nerves, Or of peculiar nature, may escape The blasting hand of sickness, or may thrive On vegetable fare, yet oft we view Where poverty more generous food denies, Tottering Rachitis seize its helpless prey; Or slow-consuming Tabes; or within His mazy labyrinth, the tortuous worm Finding a sure asylum, multiplies His noisome produce. Hence the unwieldy head, Distended joints, limbs variously incurved. Hence the sunk cheek, the hollow lifeless eye: Hence loss of balmy sleep, and appetite, Convulsive motions, agonizing spasms, And symptoms, which, in order to describe, Had foil'd the Coan Sage. For maugre those Who idly speculate, by fancy ruled, Or superstition; nature, we assert, Form'd us, with mingled diet, herb, root, seed, And animal, to gratify our taste, Or foster life; a truth, the anatomist Plainly demonstrates; nor will reason's mind Admit a doubt. The crude or sluggish juice Which vegetables yield, with toil perspired, Weakens the stomach, whose contraction fails, Not justly stimulated; while the skin Its pores block'd up, or e'en its texture changed, Is cover'd o'er with incrustations foul, Scarcely, if ever, by the abstersive wave Of tepid bath removed. But if by fate These viands are refused, condemn'd to taste Nought but bird, fish, or beast, a putrid mass Is gender'd, which pollutes the vital flood, And taints each humour, till the general frame Dissolves as in a thaw. These truths regard; By nature heeded, when with care She form'd The lacteal fluid; a peculiar mixt, Skilfully blended; by digestion due, Or in it's winding passage thro the glands Animalized, and render'd fit to tame The ferment of acidity, to which Childhood is prone. Whence we conclude, that now When from the breast exiled, as far as art Her nicer laws can imitate, 'tis right To adapt it's food, and mingle aliment Of alkalescent quality, with that Which might to incorrigible acid turn. This to prevent, haply the bounteous streams Of Pales, from each wholesome leaf, each soft And verdant shoot, secreted, which invest Grateful, the dewy meadow, tho conceived Of virtues rare, and the intermediate link Of animal and vegetable kind, Will want sufficient power. We fear not then To bid thee from the herd or flock derive Part of thy infant's sustenance; but still With licence circumscribed. As yet the spoon Retaining, covet not with firmer meats, To satiate hunger, till the rising teeth Spring from their latent seeds, and deck the mouth, Two rows of clearest white, The fibres else, Impacted, will not to digestion yield, A harden'd, tough, indomitable mass: Nor will the salivary glands emit Their needful liquid. By compulsive fire Rather extract the pure nutritious juice, Mix'd with the virgin lymph; with this combine The generous gifts of Ceres; and behold The dairy offers it's nectareous store; And Carolina sends her pearly grain. Rare, and more rarely, now thy breast unveil, Nor to a distant day protract the time Of final separation; he requires No farther aid of thine; thee other cares Haply demand, thee other duties; go, Thou wert not form'd for one alone, tho dear; Go, bless thy husband with a numerous race, Beauteous like this, like this with health adorn'd. How high the rank in life of Womankind! Their station how important! Hapless he Who lives unconscious of their worth! The Fool Of grosser sense, or airy libertine Who draws his judgment from the forward few, Or yielding weak, and dares with impious tongue Pronounce them all the slaves of vanity, By passion ever led, by flattery won. Their frame like our's, but with ethereal touch More delicately limb'd. The same their souls, More soft, more sensitive, and more refined, Each uncontaminated Briton owns And feels their virtues. Polishers of life! Sweeteners of savage care! Who tune the breast To harmony, or prompt to glorious deeds And emulative toil. To friendship's flame, To gratitude, how exquisitely true! Who tender confidence repay with love, Integrity unshaken, faith most pure, Warm, zealous loyalty. With honour clad, As with a robe, and beauteous ornaments Of unaffected modesty. Well-skill'd To form the growing soul, and on its young And opening bud to fix the impression deep Of every generous thought, which stimulates The future Man, to love of Parents, Friends, Offspring, and sacred freedom, while as yet Corruption suffers, in her favourite Isle The Goddess to reside. Far hence, away, Ye groveling sensualists, to Eastern climes! Where lust, and barbarous jealousy immure The passive slaves! What joy can beauty give, When strays the unfetter'd will? Or when in calm, And thinking hour, the mind unsatisfied Contemns the looser objects of desire, Pining for sympathy? And feels a void, Which roving licence never can supply? The wanton dance, the soft voluptuous strain Sung to the melting viol, nought inspires, But languor and disgust. Mistaken men! Who lose the better portion of their time, The dear domestic hour; the converse bland, Fruition of the soul, love's balmy zest Which never cloys; parental cares conjoin'd; Divided griefs; reciprocal delights; The life of nature, reason, virtue, bliss. END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. Introduction.—Address to Dr. Cullen.—The diet before-mentioned to be continued for twelve months longer.—The unvitiated taste of children to be consulted.—Error of giving them whatever we like ourselves,—Description of artificial, and more polished life.—Progress from thence to luxury, and all it's bad effects.—Particularly the abuses of the table.—Children relish bland and insipid food.—Ill effects of indulging them with wine.—One meal a day of any simple animal food, with vegetables and bread, to be allowed to them.—Pickles, salted meats, and sweetmeats condemned.—The only drink of children should be water. —Praise of that element.—Fruits recommended.—When arrived at the age of four years, the meals of children to be regulated and confined to the common stated times.—Advantages of a child, thus brought up, over others.—Remainder of the subject mentioned.—Thoughts of the Author thereupon. Again from busy care, from thoughts which prey On the reflecting mind, from the rank walks Of men, where folly dwells, and base design, And flattery mean, and servile complaisance, From the dissembled friend whose hollow heart Professing service, aims but to deceive, I seek the muse; whose charms can softly steal Affliction from itself, whose power can smoothe The paths of rugged toil, can heal the wound Of discontent, and calm the throbbing breast Of indignation. To my theme again Well-pleased I turn, and view the simple race Of infant innocence, as yet unwarp'd By education, blameless nature their's, And passions undebauch'd, from envy free, From guile, and that assembled crew of ills Produced by commerce with a tainted world. And say wilt thou, to whom long since had flow'd The grateful strain, if apprehensive doubt Had not shrunk fearful from the public eye, And dreaded lest thy praises should appear Link'd to our slighted numbers. Say, wilt thou, Cullen! Unrivall'd master of thy art! Of soul acute, throughout the winding maze Of every devious system, to pursue And mark the steps of error! By whose aid Edina rears her academic palm! While to thy precepts listening, gathers round Attentive youth from each far-distant shore, And bigot envy droops beneath the ray Of thy superior lustre! In whose heart Dwells candour, inmate of the truly great, And modest diffidence. Whom judgment sage By long experience taught, directs to fix The bounds of theory, ne'er own'd a guide But where observance faithfully severe Hath ceased to pry; yet by her labours skill'd, As with a glance, nicely to separate What vulgar minds by seeming likeness caught, Absurdly blend; and deem thy conduct rash Till they behold with wonder health array Those cheeks in rosy mantle, lately view'd As death's pale harbingers. For to thy eye Memory her fairest tablet swift presents, And method gives that readiness of thought By them ascribed to fancy, but which springs From painful application. Say wilt thou Accept our tributary verse? Thou wilt. For in thy breast the softer graces dwell, Nor hath philosophy with stern controul Lessen'd the milder virtues of the man; Thine is the liberal breath of friendship, thine Compassion's unaffected ardour, thine The husband's and the father's tender love, And warm benevolence incircling all. At length, from stricter vigilance, the child Is freed, O mother, wean'd from thy embrace. Yet tho refused thy bosom, still attend With guardian mind, still prize our lays, for thee, For him, attuned; sincere, however else Wanting due ornament; nor haply needs Important truth the vivid dress of words, The tinsel decorations which the song Inferior claims. Nine moons are past, twelve more As we have taught, proceed; such thrifty fare Is best; thy child's pure nature doth not ask Variety of meats. He thrives, He grows, His cheeks unsullied bloom, his soul expands, Thou seest his smiles, his gay incessant voice Resounds; what covets thy fond wish? And now His strength increased, his more elastic limbs By constant motion exercised, his teeth Given for utility, not shew, demand Food more substantial. Yet, by every grace Which doth, or ought to inspire the female breast, By holy temperance, by every nice Exciting sensibility, but chief By that internal sting which goads the soul To potent love of offspring, I conjure, I charge thee, mother, friend, with strict regard Consult thy child's unvitiated taste. Oh! as thou would'st the invenom'd adder shun, Renounce their false opinion, who, seduced By ignorance misjudging, think whate'er Delights their grosser appetites, will please Will suit his unhabituated lip; And thus unknowing, but with liberal hand, Cherish their babes with poison. Wretched race! Unconscious criminals! Murthering thro love The hapless beings they would die to save. By social laws estranged from nature's paths, We lead an artificial life; and feel Unnumber'd wants, which indolence begets On fond imagination. Polisht high, The cultivated manners yield no doubt Joys of superior kind; hence speaks the stone At sculpture's touch, the breathing canvas lives, And poetry and music fire the soul. A thousand nameless elegancies mix Our jarring minds, and by collision soft Vanquish their native roughness; modest love Binds her enchanting cestus; on our steps The Graces wait; we drop the tear humane Of sacred pity; and benevolence Tho powerless to relieve, affords a sigh. The chaster genius of convivial mirth Around our table smiles, and drives far off Brutal ebriety; profusion yields The place to neatness; and the internal sense Is caterer to the external. Thus upraised By slow degrees from barbarism obscure Man gains his elevation. Oh! how blest, Could ever-roving fancy be content! But always on the wing she strains her flight In quest of novelty, Hence every thread Fine-stretch'd before, must still be finer drawn. Our polisht manners turn to frivolous; The soul of art neglected, we behold The outward shew; unskill'd to comprehend The large design, on parts minute, on toys, And splendid colourings we doat; reject The strain emphatic, curious of the phrase Uncommon, or sonorous period round; And music must surprize, not charm the heart. To elegance succeeds the spurious brood Of soft voluptuousness. Love, holy love, The fairest flower life's garden e'er can boast, Falls to the ground, and changeful wantonness Rank particolou'd weed springs forth, sure bane To every virtue. Pity dwindles down To mean self-love; and seeming generous, We're but the slaves of vanity. We seek We covet the protracted meal, and still Goad, as it palls, our jaded appetite With new incentives. Ransack every clime, Commerce the boasted cause, for every rare And stimulating condiment, spread o'er Our northern boards the spices of the south, Adapted to it's habitants, to us Noxious, and only fit to gratify The sense debauch'd which loathes its proper fare. For by cold gales our muscles firmly braced Act with due force: Or else the ethereal stream Perhaps condensed, flows stronger from the brain, And gives to every limb its healthful tone. Not so beneath more torrid heavens, there sink The vital powers, to mortal languor doom'd, Unless excited by the quickening warmth Of aliment more active. What to them Nature commands, to us her laws forbid. And though unconscious of immediate ill, At length the stomach, harasst and o'erworn By this licentious diet, fails; the pulse Weakly contracts, each nerve decays, old age Hastes immaturely on, and round the brow Scatters untimely snows. The softer sex Indulging thus, besides the common lot, Suffer peculiar accidents, which well The skilful muse, if so inclined, could sing. E'en accidents which thwart the general law, Nor to their much-desiring souls allow To clasp a child, and bear a mother's name. But whether thou beneath the sordid yoke Of luxury wilt not bend, and truly wise, Refined, but not enervate, view'st with joy The plain and frugal table, such as erst Angels and Patriarchs sought: Or whether warp'd By tyrant custom, as we blushing own Many there are in these degenerate days, Women, the worst of epicures; remove Far from thy children each high-seasoned dish, Each sauce impregnate with the seeds of fire, Each spice, and pungent vegetable, none Admit, of foreign or of native growth Short is the time stretch'd to its utmost date Of man's existence; to contract thy own Intent, yet spare thy child; draw not a veil O'er the young morn of life: From thee he springs, Would'st thou so quickly trace his setting beam? Plunged in death's sable wave ere thou hast run Thy own brief day? Daughter of fashion! no. Though all thy relative affections fade, And every soft sensation droops beneath The sickly blast of pleasure, tho thou flit'st On giddy plume and thoughtless, mid the wilds Of vanity and folly, we acquit Thy devious soul of wilful homicide. Read then our moral page, and better taught, Know right from wrong, and sense, by action, prove. Should'st thou reject our lays, as who can scan The deeds of mad caprice? Well-pleased we turn From gay saloons, from courts, from haughty wealth, And midnight riot, to more gentle scenes, Sure of the spotless heart, and its applause. Learn from thy child, O parent! He will teach Full oft the diet suited to his frame. View with what marks of loathing, he at first Rejects the hot and acrid; instinct dwells Within, a faithful guard; his rapid pulse And native warmth by these are quickly urged Beyond their bounds. He relishes the bland, And to thy taste insipid; these controul Each motion, nor permit his heat to rise Above its due degree. Nor less he shuns Destructive Bacchus; why then will his sire By frequent repetition strive to o'ercome Nature's dislike? why, but because himself Fond of the rosy god, and led astray By reverend prejudice, he wholesome deems The fever-stirring draught? Nor wants he names Of high authority, physicians sage To justify his creed. But use destroys The benefit he seeks, and if disease Should wine's assistance claim, it then may lose Its medicinal power. To every word Each act attentive, children imitate Whate'er they see or hear; this principle Strongly within their little breasts alive, Impels them oft to venture hardy war Against antipathy. Of this beware, The struggle nicely mark, and point their aim To proper objects. Nor because you praise The circling glass, and they with many a sip Vanquish their feelings, deem that nature prompts To what, except more rarely, it abhors. Indulge aversion, combat with desire; A maxim safe and just; for this, by art Misled, may urge to danger, but to abstain Will prove at least innocuous. Nor believe That from ourselves we judge, and interdict What our own taste refuses. When the frame Is perfect, when the fibres have acquired Their utmost growth, more steady are the laws Of our corporeal organs, less disturbed, To change less subject. Never would I shun The friendly intercourse of souls, which wine In moderate draughts augments. We know its power To cheer the wretch desponding and forlorn Upon the sickly couch; to mitigate Stern fever's putrid vehemence; excite The torpid heart, till it propell anew The languid-circling blood, in every vein More strenuously alive; to calm the rage Of phrenzy, and imagination's tide Vague-shifting to controul, till reason smile. Full well we know it's power to raise the strength Of drooping age, and in his sluggish limbs Awake the latent fire. But childhood needs No foreign aid to stimulate the brain. Ever with rapid speed from forth that fount Of heat and motion bursts the nervous stream; Each irritable fibre is full-fraught Almost to excess, nor asks the least supply. Canst thou improve on nature? She this store Puts to its proper use; this urges on In due proportion each increasing tube, Muscle, and bone, and ligament. Canst thou Direct her actions? Rather shalt thou find To exceed, will cause defect, thy child curtail'd Of his just size and stature, weak, and wan. And should be rush hereafter, madly rush Amid the intemperate herd, and daily seek The noisy rout of Comus, how, too late Wilt thou repentant mourn thy rash exploit, His appetite first led astray by thee, His early relish of the fervid bowl! Nice, and perhaps erroneous in their plan, The younger animals as yielding less Of due nutrition, and digested slow, Some disallow. That, food prepared from those Of growth mature, thro the intestinal maze Less tardily proceeds, we not deny: More acrid are its juices, doubtless thence More stimulating; but its fibres hard Remain, unwrought to chyle. The young are bland, Composed of humours suited to the young, Viscous, nutritious, slower in their course. But as the absorbents greedily imbibe Whate'er is nutritive, by this delay They drink their fill, and to the solids add The mild tenacious substance. Yet, not bound To partial theory, without reserve We bid thee take thy choice of all the tribes Which bounteous heaven affords, and common use Before thee sets, of every age and size. All but the stall'd, and cramm'd, by filthy sloth And gluttony, perverted from the state Of wholesome nature; send the mass corrupt Of nauseous humours, and of rancid oil Far from thy board. In simplest manner drest, Of these one daily meal we grant thy child, But not commixt, his be one dish alone. Grudge not with these of vegetable store A plenteous portion, nor permit the bread To lye untouch'd beside him. Thus indulge His appetite, and let him freely eat Till hunger be sufficed. This rule observe; All animals which wildly range the earth, Or fluid air, and all of vigorous age With flesh of darker grain, experience finds More alkalescent, these the freer use Of plants and herbs acescent will demand. The tame, the young, and those of whiter hue, Require them less. Heed well what we condemn; All things which housewife art with care preserves, Acid, or salt, or saccharine: all cates Of unfermented flour composed, or those Of fulsome sweetness, and enrich'd with wine. These let thy child avoid. And be his drink The purest element, with which of old, Heroes, and champions at the Olympic games, Sated their thirst, and glorious deeds perform'd, In war, and manly exercise; or he The heaven-devoted Nazarene, to whom Cords were as threads, when fired with holy zeal He burst his bonds, and with his single hand Hew'd down opposing armies. Hence each spring, And limpid fountain, every stream which flow'd Soft-murmuring o'er its pebbled bed, was graced By wise antiquity with hallowed forms, Pure nymphs, and gentle naiads. Well they knew The virtues of the crystal wave, e'er vile Fermented liquors had enslaved their taste, And thinn'd mankind. Pass we the Atlantic foam, Where Britain o'er her alien sons now claims Disputed sway; a hardy people there Inhabited, bold, active, in the chace Unequall'd, patient of fatigue, to foes Though unrelenting, yet to honour just, True to their plighted faith, to strangers kind, Not one of limb deform'd, or trembling nerve Among them dwelt, and numerous were the tribes. We did not root them out with savage hand, And bathe their fields in blood, but to their lips More slyly proffer'd the Circean charm. They drank the poison down, and by degrees Relinquish'd their paternal fields to us. Rare, scatter'd are their clans, some quite extinct, Potent of yore, ere the destroying draught Was introduced. The remnant are corrupt, Perfidious, treacherous; European cups Have taught them every European vice. Still flourishing perhaps, had they disdain'd The snare, contented with the simple streams Which issue from their rocks. Give then thy child The blameless fluid, friendly to mankind, From whence, Hygeia fills her sacred urn, Nectar of paradise; nor will he gain Unless debauch'd, a liquor to his taste More grateful. Nay, would'st thou, if age permit, And strength unbroken, thy example add, Trust me no other beverage will so well Assist digestion, none the spirits cheer, Inspire with calm serenity the mind, And make the night glide by in tranquil sleep. But lo! where with Vertumnus comes the Nymph Presiding o'er the garden, in her hand Waves Amalthea's horn, whence prodigal Her freshest store descends. She asks me, why This long neglect? And bids me sing her gifts. Her various fruits, whose juices the warm sun By secret fermentation hath matured From aqueous, acid, bitter, and austere To rich luxurious flavour. Hither lead The childish train indulgent, let not fear In scanty measure to their taste impart The ripe and wholesome banquet. Still while roll The summer months along, while heat intense Darts through our frame, and stimulates our nerves, Till languor each o'erlabour'd thread subdue, And in each tube the purple current teems With seeds of putrid violence, to them The summer months innocuous roll along, Innocuous glows the fervid sky, controul'd Their baneful influence by Pomona's aid. For them, unsparing, for we scarce can set The limits of restriction, pluck thy fruits, Nature's delicious antidote 'gainst all The hidden venom of the sultry year, Mild, cooling, saponaceous, nutritive. For them the blushing berry underneath Its verdant leaf is hid, for them adorns Its rough and prickly shrub, for them depends The clustering currant from its smoother stem. For them is deck'd each tree. The ruddy peach, The golden apricot, the cherry, boast Of Kentish soil, the fragrant nectarine, The plum, green, purple, azure, the moist pear, The apple, theme of the Silurian Bard, In fulness of profusion grow for them. Nor would I when by chance more vigorous suns Its harshness meliorate, not cull for them The autumnal grape, nor to their lips forbid The well-rear'd melon, nor the Ananas' rich And poignant crispness. They are form'd for all, And all for them. More cautiously supply Whate'er by rough and bitter husk and shell Is circumscribed, and all the hoard which asks The mellowing hand of age. Or those we gain From climes far-distant, ere they have acquired Their just perfection gather'd; shaddock crude, Pomegranate, orange. Let Hesperia's Sons, Let the Antillean Planter, or the tribes Of fertile Asia, gratify their taste With all the unlabour'd bounty of their soil; Yet is not our's ungrateful; industry Here cloaths our fields, our gardens, and our groves, With plenty all its own; Pomona smiles; For cultivation oft bestows a zest, Which wild exuberant nature would deny. Ere yet we close the strain, one error more The muse will combat. Tenderness may prompt Whene'er thy child shall ask thee, to bestow The needless viand. In his younger days We bound thee not to rules. But now when o'er His head four annual suns have roll'd, advise That he be taught submission to the laws Of social life, which stated hours appoints For action, and repast. Nor heed the voice Of ignorance, which talks of exercise, And quick digestion. Often well we know The vicious taste of idle wantonness Demands restraint. But lest to thee it seem As real hunger, from the coarser loaf, A pure, tho homely nutriment, supply His craving; thus, with certainty detect Fictitious appetite. His other meals Yet undirected, both at morn and eve, Be fresh-drawn broths, and milk in various forms With rice, or other farinaceous grain Inspissated. We would not stint thy child, And know his growth requires a constant flux Of plastic fluids; nay, 'tis best to err, If err, in quantity; the flexile tubes Of children, will perhaps with ease transpire What is redundant. But with heed observe: Add thy discretion to the muse's lore: And reason, and experience be thy guides. Now duly taught by thy maternal care, O never may he turn his vagrant steps Aside, to dwell mid the polluted tents Of bestial luxury! We would not wish A stoical indifference, to fly Forever those delights which sway mankind, The exhilarating bowl, which opes the heart; And festive banquet, where preside the powers Of wit and decent mirth; but may he live, Born for society, no hermit sour, Or driveling moralist, absurdly grave, And singularly dull. Temperate by choice, But not austerely abstinent. By thee Is the foundation in his primal years Firm laid, by which he need not sacrifice To rigid niceness; but with health his friend, Will not start back from every little change, Which weaker habits must with caution shun, Or cannot with impunity indulge. Thine is the work, and gratitude shall then Repay the debt, the filial debt he owes. Then shalt thou feel, tho strong the instinctive tie Of blind affection, what sublimer joys Reason affords, the generous mutual bond, Thy tender love, his tribute of the soul. Thus far the Muse Didactic hath essay'd Her purposed theme, scattering before the steps Of truth and science, o'er their toilsome paths The not unfrequent flower; the sweets which bloom On those delicious banks forever green, Fed by translucent rills, which murmuring sweep O'er sands of gold; where fancy loveliest nymph Delighted strays, or with the sylvan powers, Dryads, and fauns, disporting, joins the dance, And sings her wildest note; or silent stands, Her roving eye, her giddy step enthrall'd, Attentive to Minerva's heavenly voice, Enamour'd of her wisdom; and from her Receives the potent wand by judgment form'd, And waves it o'er her works, which thence remain Unfading and immortal. Rest not here O Virgin, still be infant man thy theme; And what of cloathing, what of exercise He needs, relate: nor his diseases scorn With hand benign to paint, and teach the cure. Thou wilt not, if the sharp inclement air Of cold neglect freeze not thy vital warmth, And in the cave of solitude fast bind Thy wings aspiring, which shall shed their plumes Of varied die, or fold thee ever round In sullen indignation. Rather far From thee be thoughts like these! Stoop not thy soul To fears of vulgar nature; high above This sordid earth direct thy piercing eye, And view where rear'd beyond the gulph of death Stands fame's refulgent dome, to living wight Aye inaccessible. Still, as of yore Thou sought'st the Ascrean, or the Mantuan bard, Thy visions spread before my raptured sight, And soothe my ear with those celestial strains, Which on Olympus' lofty top reclined, Charm Jove himself: while virtue, reason, truth, Humanity, and Jove, each sound applaud, And bless the unprostituted lyre. Oh! hail Ye pure, ethereal bards, who nobly stoop'd To teach mankind! who round the flowing locks Of fancy, cast the sacred wreathe, inwove By the fair fingers of utility, Which scorns caprice, and whim, amusive toys, And trifles vain, the unprofitable gawds Which catch the light and airy mind of youth, Or vacant pleasure! Hail again ye bards! Nor only ye of Greece and Rome, who first Stole from the croud profane my chastened thoughts, And as I gazed upon your page, inspired The holy frenzy of ambitious love, Aiming with ardent, but successless toil, To emulate your beauties! Ye too hail Ye sons of Britain! Masters of the song! Thou Akenside, late wept by every muse, Whose skilful hand unlock'd the secret source Of mental pleasure, founded in the new, The graceful, and sublime! Nor blind to worth, Tho still upon this wave-worn shore it stand Of troublous life, by envy's blasts assail'd, Be thou ungreeted, Armstrong, in my verse, Thou Parent of the prophylactic lay! Nor Mason, thou, whose polisht taste instructs To form the English garden, mingling art, With rural wildness, and simplicity! Nor Beattie, friend of truth, whose gothic harp As if from magic touch, emits such tones, That e'en Apollo might his lyre forget, And wonder at the harmony; while pleased, In Edwin's ripening genius, we behold The progress of thy own! Hail too ye friends Of nature, and the muse, of soul refined, Of judgment unimpair'd, by slavish art Unmanacled, who, feeling, dare confess The pleasure which ye feel! who, mid the scenes Of calm retirement, from the genuine cup Nectareous, virtue-crown'd, drink true delight! While the mad riotous crew at distance heard, Disturb not your pure ears, nor ought inspire But pity and contempt? To you alone These bards have sung, to you alone I sing. O let me mingle with the hallowed band, By you exalted! Let me scorn with you, The base, luxurious, dissipated great; Who to the yoke of every foreign vice Bow down the neck disgraceful, and retain Only the name of Britons. Strangers they To every wish, each thought of nobler kind, Absorb'd in selfish joys, of public good, Of private virtue, heedless. Skill'd to game, To waste their trifling hours beneath the shade Of indolence, to steer the fragile bark O'er the smooth wave of folly. They applaud What taste condemns; their highest excellence, To deck with richest offerings the vain shrine Of those musicians, who distort the most The native elegance, and most pollute Each charm of melody; or those who urge The human voice divine to heights which well Madness might emulate: While Jackson's strains, Breathing in every note the soul of love, Of passion, feeling, sense, and sentiment, Flow unrewarded; save that nature stands Listening, and drinks in every thrilling sound. Delicious, but unprofitable meed Of elevated genius! Fond of shew, Of pompous scenes, of barren novelties, Of tortured incidents, and poor finesse, Filch'd from the Gallic, or Italian stage, They relish not, while they pretend to admire Our Shakespeare's matchless energy. The voice Of wisdom they despise; the sacred lyre They trample in the dust; a catch, a glee, A song obscene, a libel, which destroys Some good man's peace of mind, and blasts his fame, Strikes their weak souls with rapture. Wedded love They flout to scorn; posterity with them Is lighter than a shade; a rapid whirl Of vice fantastic hurries on their lives; And e'en the flatterer, whom they feed, would blush To praise their memory. Is this the race, O Britain, nurse sublime of heroes old, Of patriots, sages, who thy state have raised To its all-envied height! Is this the race Destined to guide thy counsels? form thy laws? Croud thy once-awful senate? Against these, Must public spirit idly strain the nerve? To these, must worth, and modest merit yield? The reptile spawn of insignificance, Corruption-foster'd? Then farewell to all Thy boasted glories! Stile thyself no more The Queen of nations; levell'd with the mean And undistinguish'd kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast been free! The Æra will arrive; Thou shalt be free no more! O'er folly, vice, Aristocratic faction shall usurp, Or bold, and enterprising monarchy With justice claim dominion. 'Tis most fit. Amid the extensive records of mankind, It ne'er was found that freedom could survive Where honour dwelt not; where with careless eye, Or, but intent on pleasure, luxury sat And view'd her chain, unmoved; where love of fame, Where the keen hopes of future praise, no more Awoke the generous deed, the grateful praise, Paid by posterity to liberal souls, Who plan the good of ages. Yet, at once Quit not this isle O virtue! In the scenes, The lower scenes of action, linger still. Far from the plague-struck capital, inspire The honest individual; in his soul Cherish the warm affections; let him feel The joys of unpolluted love, and think His offspring worth his care! Still may'st thou walk On Isca's banks, where thro the blooming vale Its lucid stream meanders, and receive The orisons, which there thy votaries pour From hearts unconscious of deceit, untaught The false refinements of superior life! Blest by the muse, in nuptial friendship blest, Forbid the external sight of things, within Illumed by goodness, and the beams serene Which taste, which wisdom, and contentment shed, May Blacklock still enfold thee! May'st Thou dwell From pride far distant, from the tyrant sway, And noon-tide glare of vanity, with him, And his compatriots! Drop the expressive tear O'er Gregorys' tomb; in whom alive, combined All, that the sapient head, or feeling heart, Proclaim; and admiration, and esteem, And reverence, move! Then cast thy eyes around, And own thou ne'er beheld'st a soil more pure! A soil, where manly parts, and sense acute Spontaneous rise, and every female grace Adorns with innocence and chaste reserve The matron's bosom. Spite of southern pride, The rancorous lye, or partial ridicule, Its sons and daughters perfect in their kind. In bravery, worth unquestion'd, strength of soul, In modest tenderness, domestic charms, Tho equall'd, ne'er surpast. Thus may'st thou still Preserve a few from the contagious air Which luxury breathes! A remnant whence to learn What Britons erst have been! Preserve them Heaven! And when they cast the page of flattery by, Let them with kindred warmth these notes approve, And say, the strains are our's, for us attuned, And for the sake of children yet unborn.

Sweet is the breath of fame, and o'er the soul Of youth, on fancy's pinions wafted back, The daring visitor of times unknown, And future ages, like a spicy breeze Steals her delicious fragrance; like a breeze From Zeylon or Sumatra, which enchants The sailor's heart, tho night involves the coast, And hides its lovely foliage from his view: While in his mind he sees the blooming groves, And haply thinks them fairer than they are. Sweet o'er my bosom stole the breath of fame In early life, on fancy's pinions borne; The ideal prospects rose supremely fair, And in extatic vision I beheld Perennial bays distinguishing my tomb. For not unuseful, or of light import The strains I sung. And tho mid glades obscure Dwelt the sequester'd muse, from riot far, From pomp imperious, and the lordly board Begirt with servile flatterers, yet her breast By human kindness sway'd, where'er had pierced The British language, manners, arts, and arms, Revered the good; and base-born envy dead, Or vanquisht, or engaged with living worth, Exulted in the esteem of times to come, And virtue's mutual friendship unreserved. In distant continents, where horrid war Now stains with brother's blood the guilty soil, In distant islands, mid their nodding palms, And growing sweets, her eyes survey'd with joy The willing parent bending o'er her lay. Dear to the youthful mind, ye prospects hail! Ye visions wide-removed! for deep Ye thrill'd, Fixing, as real, all your traces there. And, if illusive all, yet riper age Can scarce believe the flattering scenes untrue, Or cease the vivid colours to behold Bright glowing thro the shadowy lapse of years. Meanwhile, O Codrington! whose generous heart Blames not the tenor of my partial song; By whom uncensured flows the self-applause. Whose temper, mild as an autumnal sky, No cloud obscures; with feelings warm, yet ruled By cautious judgment, in whose breast resides Friendship's pure heaven-descended flame; alive To all a parent's fondest love; yet both Under superior reason's nice controul Directed to their truest end and use! For thee, and such as thee, an audience small, In space and number circumscribed, by wealth, By rank and titles undebased, again I venture the Pierian spring to seek, And tread on sacred ground. How difficult Where, thro the laurel-groves, and myrtle shades, The verdant alleys, lawns, and rising slopes, Thick strewn with flowers of every various hue, Of every various season, elegance, Coy nymph, unsated wanders, on each scene With curious eye commenting, from the sweets, The never-fading blooms, each virid arch, Selecting meetest garlands, to suspend Upon the tree of taste, most eminent In the poetic region, underneath Whose fragrant shelter, Phœbus and the Nine In chorus met, attune their happier strains Of rarest harmony: How difficult, By health and youth attended, to pursue The bashful maid, attract her favouring eye, And woo her to bestow a single wreathe! Can I then hope, whom sickness long hath drench'd In her Lethæan dews, with feeble limbs, And wan complection, from her hands to bear Those gifts, which unpossest, my lays must creep Dully monotonous, nor touch the heart, Nor win the approving mind? Yes witness thou! Witness my friend! Who know'st the human frame, Each drug of cordial, each of healing power, To me in vain administer'd, what toil I must experience now, the nymph to trace Through her meand'ring walks! what partial chance Should she my languid homage not disdain! Yet, thy inciting voice, the conscious thought Sprung from the love of kind, which tells me all Will not be frustrate, nor the darling wish Of public good be wholly unfulfill'd; Some loitering rays of that once brighter flame My soul enkindling, prompt me to a task Long interrupted: Where in slumbers deep It rests, to awaken the Didactic Lyre; With its more solemn notes to mingle tones (So they to memory fail not to recur) Oft heard of yore, as toward the lucid fount I stole, not unforbidden; tones which please Heighten'd the more by contrast, and engage Amusive the charm'd ear, till it imbibe Instruction with delight, till melody Not the chief object seem, its liquid voice Yielding to reason's energy divine. Of cloathing now, of heat, and cold we sing, Unanimating themes; but which require The attention of the bard, as not of use Inferior to the subjects which erewhile He strove to adorn; nor claiming notice less From the true bosom of parental love. Still heed we nature, and her guiding steps Pursue; nor, tho with moans, and plaintive cries From his concealment issues to the light Man's tender progeny, believe, he feels The external air his undefended frame Keenly invade. These moans, these cries proceed From other causes. To his lungs at once, Expanding their nice substance, rushes in The forceful air. The circulating blood Alters its course, thro channels unessay'd Impell'd, whose first resistance haply claim Exertions of the labouring heart, quick, strong, If not convulsive, yet irregular. Exertions of the lungs themselves, to gain Their necessary powers, and genial spring. Add too that oft each muscle, every limb Strain'd and comprest, scarce bears the gentlest touch, Sore from the late hard conflict undergone, And agonies maternal. But to cold, Know, he is born impassive; or at least With vital warmth supplied, to render vain Its most severe assault; beyond the scale Of heat which stimulates maturer age. He needs not art's assistant hand, or dress Of studied care. Uncloath'd, in wilder climes, Like the more hardy natives of the soil, E'en in the polar regions, he might brave The freezing atmosphere. Nay, unwithheld By dubious fears, tho placed indeed beneath More favouring skies, there are, who from his birth Plunge the infant stranger in the gelid wave, Where unappall'd the mother too enjoys The bath's refreshing coolness. But, nor harsh, Nor fanciful, we shall not recommend To thee, more delicate in form and mind, Daughter of Britain, these examples, drawn From savage nations, and from tribes remote. Cloath'd be thy child; so polisht custom wills, And decent manners: but in airy garb, Loose, and uncinctured. Thus he shall avoid The torment of accumulated heat, Nor from unnatural coercion feel Distress and anguish. With minuter rules To croud the page, and dull, or quaint, describe His vesture, what materials should compose Each article, and whether by the loop, Or pin restrain'd, tho as the last may bring Danger, nay death, the caution which forbids Its use, above the trivial-seeming cause Important rises, descants such as these, Prolixly mean, would argue in the muse Failure of judgment, no respect to Thee. Suffice the general maxim; to dilate, And to the test each consequence reduce, Be thine. Bright glows the warm maternal soul, And clear, illumined by a hint alone. Nor flows with that necessity the strain, As erst it might, when barbarous hands around The new-born Babe fold over fold inwreath'd The circling band. Amid the wanton gales Which luxury breathes, amid the changeful swarms Which fashion decks in her cameleon hues, Amid the increasing follies of our age, And vices not perhaps destructive less Than those of old, tho softer, milder far, Link'd with humanity, and taught to charm, To poison by politeness; justice owns, While the rough virtues of our ancestors And manly genius we no more behold: Our souls revolt from habits which enslaved Unamiable their minds, and from the sway Of prejudice, whose galling shackles long Their vigorous faculties controul'd. This truth Justice confesses, this, the instructive muse. Gladly, O mother! We congratulate Thy infant, who from life's first dawn enjoys His birth-right, who the vital air at will Inhales, nor feels corporeal bonds. With me Revert thine eyes, and lo! their hapless sons, How braced and pinion'd, who to extend the reign Of civil liberty, with ardour toil'd, Who fought, who bled to extend it. Nor escaped The race preceding our's. See, where they lye, True objects of compassion! round them close Is fixt the painful bandage, not a limb Can move; sad victims to the erroneous creed Which holds that nature incompletely acts And forms defective works, that art may give The strength by her refused, and perfect thus The unfinisht system, gasping they recline In real martyrdom. The shriek is heard, The groan, the sob expressive, but in vain. In vain the little captive, as awhile Released from durance, utters sounds of joy, Stretches his arms well-pleased, and smiles, and casts His looks delighted on the cheerful blaze, Or waving taper. To his fetters soon Remanded, he in vain attempts to cope With arbitrary power, each effort tries, Shews by each deed the abhorrence which he feels, Adding the emphatic eloquence of tears, Of inarticulate, but deep distress, And struggles all-impassion'd to be free. With pity and contempt thy soul beholds This picture. What calamities ensued, Experience proved; but idiot bigotry Confess'd them not. The evolving principle Within, the plastic juice augmenting size, Thus partially impeded, could not urge The destined fibres onward, or enlarge By due accretion e'en the vital cells Requiring speediest growth. Yet active still, In disproportion'd manner, to the head Unseemly bulk they added; or the joints Distended, and relax'd. Or oft from pain Shrinking, the child, uconscious but of ease, Curved by forced attitudes the flexile bones, Nay the all-supporting spine. The obstructed breath, The fluids in their circulating course Unnaturally check'd; the irriguous glands; The fount whence motion, and sensation spring, And future intellect, the brain itself, Disturbed, or with more lasting injury Impress'd, exclaim'd at this preposterous war, The war which Step-dame art with nature waged. Call'd by society to tread the paths Of busy life, from its hard slavery soon The stronger sex was freed; and ere too late, Haply by nature's potent air restored, Could boast a frame of vigour unimpair'd, And undeformed. But to long sufferings doom'd, The female race, so will'd perverted taste, For many a year pined underneath the force Of this domestic torture. For as erst The mother strove to assist their infant nerves, And give to weakness strength: She now assay'd Her progeny to embellish, and their shape To mould, as fancied beauty in her eye Deceptive shone, Heaven! that the human mind Warp'd by imagination, should believe, Or e'en suggest it possible, the form, Whose archetype the Deity himself Created in his image, could be changed From it's divine proportion, and receive By alteration, comeliness and grace! That round the zone which awkwardly reduced E'en to an insect ligament the waist, The blooming loves should sport, enticing charms, And young attractions! Heaven! that e'er a bard, (The genuine bard is nature's sacred priest) Forgetful of his charge, should deck with praise As fair and lovely, what would strike the soul Unwarp'd by custom, as a subject fit For scorn, indignant spleen, or ridicule. Yet Prior! tho nor taste nor reason blend Their essence with the verse, while lasts the tongue Thy numbers help'd to polish, while the powers Of melody bear sway, the verse shall live, Beauteous description of a gothic shape. Oh! may the manners of thy nut-brown maid, Her artless truth, simplicity of soul, Her fondness, and intrepid constancy, Long in the bosoms of the British fair, Tho banish'd every other region, dwell, Delighted inmates! May their eyes still beam With all her speaking rays, their cheeks endue Her modest crimson! But may never more “The boddice aptly laced” their panting hearts Confine, or mutilate that symmetry Of limb and figure, whence a Zeuxis' hand His all-accomplish'd Helen might have form'd, Or a Praxiteles with happiest art Sculptured a Venus. Tho meridian day Behold them drest as potent fashion bids, Girt with exterior ornaments uncouth, Trappings disgustful; yet at morn, or eve, Or when they to the genial bed repair, Still may they charm the melting eye of love With elegance and grace, the fabled dames Of classic soil transcending, native grace, And elegance unveil'd, which mocks attire. Return digressive muse! to approach the shore Of Cyprus, or to breathe the tepid gales From Achedivias' island wafted round Is not thy choice; tho Camoens' shade invite, And Mickle with his glowing spirit fraught, As each heroic, so each scene of joy Paint with a master's fire unlimited By cold translation. Never may our strain One vague idea raise, which spotless minds May blush to own, much less insult the glance Of virgin purity, or harshly wound The conjugal and chaste maternal ear. Digressive muse return! our proper theme Is man's first helpless state, our tuneful aid The ingenuous parent claims. Resolved to bless Thy child with ease and freedom, taught to shun By the dire act of swathing, all constraint So baneful, let no part escape thy care. Nor load the head; nor till he walk abroad, At least till firmly he can press the ground, Cover the legs or feet. Some precepts here To cloathing unattached, or slightly link'd, We mean to inculcate. Need I then to thee, O mother, whom the soul refined alone Can prompt to inspect my numbers, recommend The Virtues' dear correlative, (as they The mental frame, so the corporeal, she Adorning, rendering pure) the decent maid, Unsullied cleanliness, with her full oft Thy charge to visit? Not that to her shrine E'en from thy tender years thou hast not paid Sincerest worship. But my words believe, Strict watchfulness the menial train require, And if, unheedful to their trust, they slight The grave rebuke, dismiss them from thy doors. Not their's the nicer sense inspiring thee, Those principles and habits now intwined In union with thy nature. Nor is their's The babe, who smarting from their sloth, with nerves Keenly alive, by the corrosive sting Of acrimony pierced, tormented shrieks, Or moans incessant. Neither scorn as vain, The dictates which succeed, from reason learn'd. Banish the softer couch; let not thy child Recline on down; his pliant bones but now From cartilage emerging, on the bed Which yields beneath his weight may haply gain, Thus frequently recumbent, a deformed And twisted aspect, by chirurgic skill For ever irreclaimable. Nor less Such accident to avoid, with cautious eye The attendant mark, who bears him in her arms, And let her oft his posture shift, oft change From right to left, altern. A careless tribe, Purchased by interest only, is the race To servitude accustomed; trust not them. Trust thy own judgment, let thy ruling mind Govern each act of their's. Yet neither here, Nor elsewhere, mean we in a general blame To involve them all. Some from attachment serve, And to constrictive duty add the tye Of willing love. Such as a treasure prize. A countless treasure. Say, by one of these Is thy child foster'd? smoothe for her the brow, The tone of high command; let all her days Roll on illumed by kindness and esteem; Think her thy fellow labourer and thy friend; Alleviate every future ill of life, And, if thou can'st, remove them. Ne'er may she Who with maternal prudence, and the warmth Of zeal affectionate, hath lent her aid To form thy children, to support, to raise From perilous estate to strength and health, Feel the distressful sting of poverty, Or, if the means are not withheld, in thee Want a protector. But, if more than this, Her bosom hath the nutriment supplied Which thine refused, still more may she demand, And thou in justice grant the liberal boon. And Oh! Ingenuous Youth! whose blood now flusht With yet unsatiated desire, quick beats In every pulse, to mix in active life Intent, or climb where science points the way! Oh Virgin! Who with beauty deckt, and gay In unperverted innocence, around Survey'st thy homagers, yet covetest One faithful heart alone. Oh! recollect Her assiduity, her diligence, And tender care, to which thou owest the frame Able to cope with business, or sustain The toil, which knowledge asks, to gather in Her wide-spread harvest. That attentive zeal, To which thou owest the comeliness of shape, Those beauties which from every eye attract The applausive glance, and every breast inspire With love or admiration. Recollect Not frigidly, or faintly, like the crew Who every pleasure centre in themselves; Not with weak indecisive apathy; But with a bounteous and expanded soul, Estranged from self, replete with gratitude. Because the winged nations fondly brood Over their unfledg'd young; because we view Where'er reclined, her new-born offspring press Close to the parent quadruped; because By instinct irresistible impell'd The mother longs to embrace her infant charge, And hide it in her bosom; while thro wilds, Or o'er the desart mountain as she roves, The savage still her clinging babe sustains: Some, this communicated warmth affirm Is needful; and that man's else-drooping race Requires the genial contact. Mindless they, How far from nature's simpleness diverge Our steps, our every action. Were the child Unclad by day, unshelter'd thro the night, We should not hesitate to recommend What otherwise we smile at, or perchance Hold but of dubious consequence. Our lays Have taught what cold his system can repell First into light immerging: And if cloath'd As custom bids, he from himself will gain This added warmth, condensed, and on himself Recoiling. Better thus, than haply sunk Beneath the load which our nocturnal rest Demands, to feel the intense phlogistic heat Of temporary fever, or to melt In copious steam away. Much better thus, Than by the mother or the nurse oppress'd In heavy sleep, to frustrate all the schemes Parental love had formed; or placed within Some ancient hireling's bed, instead of warmth From generous blood, and balmy breath supplied, To warm the shrivell'd dotard. But, if laid From thee remote, or in the couch with thine Conjoin'd, why should'st thou not examine well And frequently his lodgment? so inform'd, Thou can'st not fail, O mother! to perceive What suits his constitution, what to add, What to subtract; doubtless thy native sense Beyond my strains will teach thee, that when rules Fierce Sirius, lighter vestments will suffice, Than when Aquarius opes his full-fraught urn, And winter arm'd with piercing frost, defies The unwarlike sun. Thy prudent soul will know His limbs in health, blest with the temperate mean, Nor heat nor cold betray. Yet truth forbids To slight exceptions which are often found Eluding justest rules. Should some disease Attack the child, and anguish writhe his frame, To shivering pain thy near approach may give Solace and ease, nay as it were, foment, Assuage, and lull the smart; or should he pine With more than common weakness, from his birth Afflicted, blasted, or untimely born With nerves imperfect, as the exotic flower Thrives not, but when included from the winds, Its fibres by the sun's concenter'd rays Are duly irritated, he may want Thy vital stimulating heat. But soon E'en then attempt increase of strength to give By other means; and seek at first the bath Of moderate temperature; by slow degrees Proceeding, till his habit can support The powerful shock which colder lymph imparts. But so diffusive is the tyrant reign Of fashion; such our table's proud excess; Such is our love of cards, time's murderers, Keen agitators of the gentlest breasts, (Which ought to be the gentlest,) such those hours, Those midnight hours, corrodent of the bloom Which else would decorate the female cheek, And animate the lips which now are pale: Such the destructive arts, when beauty fades, Its meretricious semblance to display, The lifeless white, and never-varying blush; Detected by the curious eye, which hates The fraud, and painted Cytheræa scorns: Such are our matrons, such, except the few, Who nobly singular, behold, and smile At folly's deeds absurd, that all who spring From them, may well partake the feeble nerve, And vapid blood, in which more faintly glows The living principle; and what for some We erst prescribed, we now prescribe to all, To all their children; neither do we think Even to them the song may flow in vain; For should caprice applaud, who oft usurps The throne of sense, and guides the public taste, In her wild fit round merit's brow the wreathe Intwining, which for folly she design'd, They too may cast a glance across the page Which fashion bids them read. Know then ye fair, Whom tho my heart approves not, I behold With truest pity; know, the unhappy babes Whom you have toil'd unceasing to produce Fragile and delicate, a word of your's Perhaps may rescue from impending fate. Oh! issue your commands! great is the power Of cold: yourselves no doubt have often sought In fervid summer its benign effects In the salt deep, whence braced you might endure The winter's hard campaign. And hence new tone Your offspring shall derive, their stamina In some degree corrected, while the force Of nervous influence more intensely thrills The arterial frame, and the lax muscle swells. Ye Frigid Springs! wherever first appear Your bubbling sources, underneath the grot, Or pendent shade. Ye ever-living streams! Where'er you wind pellucid thro the vales Your pastoral mazes, or o'er rocks abrupt Hurl down your dashing foam. Ye rivers wide! Where'er in proud procession to the main Your copious tribute rolls: to you my song Should grateful rise—Ye Naiads! who direct Each scatter'd rill, ere in coactive strength They flow exuberant; to your praise attuned Should sound the note melodious, and your names Would I, ye nymphs recount, and joyful paint Your attributes and virtues—But your priest, Your favourite Akenside, his hallow'd lays Hath not in vain effused, with pious voice Hymning your benefits; and all around Your sacred haunts hath cast a magic spell, Forbidding each profaner foot, the groves, The caves, the dells obscure where you sojourn, And your chaste bosoms shelter from the fire Of scorching Phœbus, wantonly to approach, Or rudely violate. Nor shall my feet Profanely tread your dark-embowering shades, Nor shall my roving eye with curious search Your deep recesses pierce. Yet, O Ye Springs! Ye Streams! Ye Rivers clear! And thou, by whom They all are fed, to whom they all return, Exhaustless Ocean! with the general song Which choral nature pours, my voice shall join Though undistinguish'd; and with all that creep, Or run, or fly, or vegetate, shall own Your fructifying, life-preserving power. Your power, which Thales, which the Man of Thebes Contemplating, affirm'd to listening Greece, That water all transcends, unrivall'd, best, The sole, prolific element of things. Whether your moisture cloathe the exulting meads With herbage, or slow-deluging the plain, You fertilize the soil, while millions view The prospect with delight, sure pledge of wealth, Of copious-teeming harvests. Whether soft And gentle your refreshing dews descend, Absorbed by each inhalant leaf and flower. Whether your rains entangle as they fall The electric fluid, and with vital strength Each seed inform, each fainting plant supply, Whether you offer to the thirsty lip Delicious draughts; or to the languid frame Of sickness your invigorating waves Wherein to bathe, and feel the tonic force Of cold at every trial brace the limbs, The heart, the brain re-act at every shock, Till, all their pristine energy restored, The fibres move responsive to their sway, And the once loitering blood propell'd anew Warm thro its channels to the surface flows. You, mid the general song which Nature pours, My grateful strains shall praise. For, not unread In Pœon's hallow'd lore, not uninform'd By chemic art, your healing qualities I too may boast to know; and whence derived, From earths, or salts, or mineral particles, Combined, suspended by attraction's laws, Or held in union by aerial chains, And crown'd with sprightly Gas. Hence, led by hope, By reason led, I drank with eager lip At those salubrious springs which make renown'd Our British Baiæ; but the obstructing cause Of ill, or relaxation faint remain'd; Such mischief waits on sedentary hours, And studious midnight thought. Hence now the shores Of hoary Neptune, hence the sounding caves I seek, and turn to the refreshing breeze My pallid face, inhaling, as I sit, The briny spray; or mark the rising sun Beyond the vast expanse diffusing wide His glorious beams, and at his orient light Dip in the fluid element; nor breathe To either power unheeded orisons. Surely, not duped by fancy, I perceive At times, as struggling to be free, the trace Of long-forgotten feelings? And my limbs More firmly press the beach! And toward the flood I move, unaided by ministrant hands. O Dawlish! though unclassic be thy name, By every muse unsung, should from thy tide, To keen poetic eyes alone reveal'd, (From the cerulean bosom of the deep As Aphrodite rose of old) appear Health's blooming goddess, and benignant smile On her true votary; not Cythera's fane, Not Eryx, nor the laurel boughs which waved On Delos erst; Apollo's natal soil, However warm enthusiastic youth Dwelt on those seats enamour'd, shall to me Be half so dear. To thee will I consign Often the timid virgin, to thy pure Incircling waves; to thee will I consign The feeble matron, or the Child on whom Thou may'st bestow a second happier birth From weakness into strength. And should I view Unfetter'd, with the sound firm-judging mind, Imagination too return, array'd In her once-glowing vest, to thee my lyre Shall oft be tuned, and to thy Nereids green, Long, long unnoticed in their haunts retired. Nor will I cease to prize thy lovely strand, Thy towering cliffs, nor the small babbling brook Whose shallow current laves thy thistled vale. END OF THE FOURTH BOOK. BOOK V. ARGUMENT.

A supposed fragment from Hesiod. To thee Monro! whose industry and skill The muse can witness, tracing every nerve, Each tube arterial, vein, and filament, With the perspicuous steel illustrating The frame of man; nor less with vivid force Of happy diction, to the observant ear Teaching that physiology on truth And reason founded, which beholds design And matchless order on the different parts Impress their functions, and pervade the whole, From final causes rising to the prime, The All-wise, All-perfect: and rejecting far From physic, from anatomy, the doubts Of Pyrrho's followers, and the assertions lewd Of shallow atheists; while in thee survives Thy father's spirit, who the school upraised, With sapient Rutherford combined, and graced The chair, his son with equal lustre fills. These strains, Monro! I consecrate to thee, To thee, and Hunter, rivals tho you are Yet in my heart, my verse, shall you be join'd, Both dear to science, to your country dear, Deserving public fame, and private love. Shall Hewson sink untimely to the grave, And I the note refuse? refuse to paint His gentle manners, amiably humane, Winning with ease their unobtrusive way Into the breast, where friendship and esteem With warm embrace received them? Or his soul Inquisitive, and ardent to detect Nature, howe'er conceal'd beneath a cloud Obscure, and to the search of common eyes Impenetrable? Shall I not lament His talents render'd useless? And the bloom Of genius wither'd in its vernal morn. When gratitude inspires the strain, shall Black Remain unsung? Who first the path essay'd Which since by many a bold adventurer trod, Hath open'd sources unexplored? disclosed Subtiler essences; to new pursuits Awaken'd chemic art? and loosed the bonds Of its establish'd empire? No; while praise He covets not, and shrinks from due applause, The muse shall not in silence pretermit His lucid facts, and philosophic toil. Tho foremost in the ranks of being, stand The men, who active in the cause of truth, Divine, or moral, or to human life Subservient, with unceasing labour ply Their task severe; to free the embodied mind, And it's ideas raise above the ken Of dull mortality; by useful arts Invented, or improved, to subjugate, And undeceive reluctant error, bring To the true test of just experiment Her specious visions, and elucidate Her dark perplexities; yet is not He Among the lowest, who their precepts strives More widely to disseminate, arrange In varied order their materials, place Objects the same in different points of view, Or cloath'd in fresher garb, attention win By seeming novelty. Nor shall the bard Howe'er condemn'd by folly, to the rank Which petulance assigns him deign to stoop His crest indignant, while he feels within That living zeal, which, by occasion fired, Would prompt his soul to dare celestial themes; Inforce the rules of action which connect Each social bond; or each ingenious mode Of art unveil, whence profit or delight Arise; and captivate with thrillings sweet Of unluxurious pleasure the nice ear Of sensibility: With thoughts select, On which no vulgar images intrude, The affections and the passions mingling bland. Ere in our lays instructive, we proceed, And dedicate the verse to exercise, 'Twere fit to search with deep attentive care The human fabric, its component parts And nature to determine, were it given To poet or philosopher to treat A subject so mysterious unreproved. Much hath anatomy distinguish'd, much Remains unknown; the rudiments of life Who ever shall explore? Where dwells the power Inherent, or acquired, which first expands The comprehensive germ? Which moulds, propells, And inorganic fluid can convert To animated fibre? In the brain Does it reside? Or in the central heart? Or do they both their energy combine? Is it subtile, elastic, and derived From that ethereal essence which perchance All space informs, and every substance fills? Or is it from the blood by wondrous means Secreted, render'd volatile, sublimed, A pure, peculiar spirit? From his state Of vegetable torpor when released, Whate'er it be, by this the infant lives, By this he moves; by this the absorbents bear Their nurture from the stomach to the veins, The wasted blood's supply, whose finer parts Perpetually exhale; this gives the lungs To play, which from the circumambient air Its vital principle inspire, and yield The effete mephitic vapour back again. This stimulates the heart, and by the heart And irritated fibres is in turn Excited, quicken'd, strengthen'd: This extends The solids, and enlarges, hasting on The circulating stream. This generates, Or is of living heat the copious fount, Active while it exists, without it's aid Soon changed to deadly cold. By this, the nerves Of every various sense with speed convey Each impulse to the brain, infixing there The indelible ideas, there arranged, Connected, modified, they haply form Or seem at least to form the soul itself, Immortal, immaterial: Hence the stores Of wisdom are establish'd; hence the flash Of wit bursts forth; and hence with keenest glance Imagination darts her eye throughout This mundane space, pierces beyond its bounds, And worlds creates, and beings all her own. Is it of Heavenly origin? A ray, A portion of divinity, this power Miraculously working? Guided sure By other springs it acts than those of chance; For what is chance but a chimæra framed From non-existence by the breath of fools? We see the deeds of highest intellect, The finger of a God. Profound we bend In adoration, and though all his ways We know not, though implicit darkness hang Over this universe immense, confess That nothing short of Deity, could e'er Conceive, or raise the edifice of man. Yet, while the mystic elements of things Are undiscover'd still, while hidden lye The interior agents; while to man himself Man is a being which his utmost pains Have fail'd to analyse; while tho we view, Or think we view the circling chain of life Depending link on link, in many a part Chasms intervene, unfill'd but by the touch Of vague conjecture, or of fancy wild: The power of observation is not given In vain; nor handed down from age to age Facts by experience sanctified; nor shines Fruitless the torch of clear analogy. Or superseding all, the purest light The steadiest, nature yields; unerring beams Which point the way to truth, while reason smiles, And judgment walks secure. O Nature! thee, Goddess benign! when first this theme I chose In early youth, with aspiration warm I call'd; thee vow'd to follow; unrepell'd By art's fastidious brow, or system's frown, Unwarp'd by theory's delusive voice. For thou alone the faithful monitor Art placed within; thy motions, if observed, Forever point to good. Nor will I now Desert thee, or retract what then I swore. For not from thee we only learn to raise The frame corporeal to its destined pitch Of health and strength; to ward with certain shield The darts of sickness; or if rushing on, Disease o'erwhelm us with impetuous might, To catch the rapid moment, and at once Expell the foe, or waste his violence By due protraction, till he quit the field: But, if by tyrant habit unenslaved, If unimpair'd by affectation vile, And imitative manners swimming down The stream of head-long custom; thine is all The mental glory: virtue, taste, design Unborrow'd, glowing thoughts, expression strong, The full emphatic eloquence of prose, The liquid flow of melody, the burst Of torrent rapture, and each foaming wave Which swells the boundless tide of verse sublime. To nature then, with me, O Parent Mind! Stoop lowly; and observe her impulse, rouse From his first slumbrous state awaked, thy child. How soon, tho active vigour be denied, His arms, his feet, the tendency display To loco-motion, and his roving eye Darting swift glances; pleased that nought around Should be at rest, nor pleased with rest himself. Indulging this propensity, to all His free unfetter'd limbs allow their quick And yet unsteady efforts; let him gain From his attendant, what he seems to ask, Perpetual exercise; tho not at first To agitation violent exposed, Or tost in playful wantonness on high, But gradually proceeding. Treated thus, Kept in unceasing action while awake, He will not need the cradle's most absurd Pernicious motion, which the giddy brain Confuses, and benumbs; on him shall steal A softer, sweeter, more refreshing sleep. Nor blame the muse, whose iterated strains, Neglecting slavish art, its use forbid: Wishing the invention with deserved contempt Exiled forever; with the untoward swing, The go-cart, and the leader, be it doom'd To blank oblivion; or preserv'd with them Only in some museum's nitch devote, Teach future times, from past examples wise, More ardently to follow nature's paths, Her simpleness to venerate, and own Her all-sufficient dictates. Let thy child Enjoy his balmy slumber uncompell'd, Or by himself alone acquired, from due Instinctive exercise: And let him learn, Untaught by others, his allotted task, To creep, to stand, to walk; and let him know Full early no assistance will be lent In ought which by his proper strength and skill He can accomplish. So shall strength and skill Hourly increase; so he by days and months The puny infant shall excell, deprived By doating fondness of his native powers; Or to the care of laziness assign'd, Who suffers him with tottering step to drag Incumbent, while the faithful eye alone Should watch, or ready hand with gentlest touch Uphold. Nor think (an argument of yore For binding every limb) his tender form Will from his own exertions e'er receive Substantial injury; a posture wrong Uneasiness will prompt him to correct: Nor will his feebleness permit the force Inducing harm, so strictly to his weight Proportion'd: and how soon, uncheck'd by art, Inherent sense, will threatened danger shun, Is wondrous. Vanquish then ideal fears; And on the matt, or carpet let him sport, And feel his growing vigour; or entice To their extremest verge his infant sight With becks, and smiles, and captivating toys. For ends most wise, and most important, flows Redundantly profuse within thy child This active principle. By exercise The quicken'd pulse and stimulated heart More truly shape each fibre, give to each Their tension, and elastic spring; urge on In swift and properly successive waves The crimson fluid, and from thence secern The different humours, healthy, bland and pure. While thro their various channels are detach'd The recremental dregs, of acrid kind, Or fraught with particles to human life Destructive. Exercise supports the flame Of life itself, that steady heat, which glows, And with peculiar fixedness, resists External cold: Nor, in the torrid zone, Where Phœbus' beams direct his fiercest ray, Is by the scorching atmosphere increased To morbid violence. By exercise, The stomach unopprest, digests, concocts, Assimilates, the generous chyle prepares, And feels again the necessary goad Of keenest appetite. That balance nice With which health corresponds, of part to part, Of muscles to their due antagonists, Fluids to solids, to themselves, the just Mixture, proportion, influence, strength of all; Even the invisible ethereal stream, As vigorous, or weak, condensed, or rare, Sensation, passion, intellect, nay more, Virtue, and vice, on exercise depend. Know its advantage then; nor judge thy child With this profusion of activity Endow'd in vain. For nature rules within, Sage tutoress, and he now will soon acquire By her instinctive precepts more than years Of labouring education can impart, So she be not in froward mood opposed, Or not unseconded by thee. Behold, And aid her movements, let him see and smell, Hear, taste, and touch all objects at his will. So the deceptive senses shall be fix'd; So early repetition shall bestow That just discrimination, that acute Perceptive swiftness, which in future life Seems instantaneous and intuitive, Innate, and unpossest by second means. Nor as with limbs more firm he treads, impede His restless ardour, his inquisitive And eager curiosity, which learns, Approaching nigh, the varied form of things, Their distance, situation, what resists, Or yields, the innocuous, and replete with harm. Excite, impell him forward; and when mind Now beams apparent, and the flexile tongue, By imitation, and habitual use, Can utter sounds articulate, the names Of every object teach him to repeat; Add daily to his store of images Simple, and unabstracted; let him walk Or run the verdant fields and lawns along, Nor thou disdain to attend him, and point out As giddy apprehension can receive, Or roving fancy lists, each herb, and tree, Mountain, and stream, and mineral, the birds Which skim the liquid air, or from the brake Pour their sweet voices, herds, and bleating flocks, Insects on wing, or on the lowly ground. With him the nimble grashopper pursue, And chace the gaudy butterfly; or strive To catch the variegated bow which plants Its base on earth, now near, but soon removed To distant hills; or bid him mark the sun Refulgent shining; or the clouds diverse; At eve, the silver moon, crescent, or full; And every star whose radiance decks the sky. Thus shalt thou see with pleasure on his cheek Health's genial hue, his limbs proportion'd just, And beauteous, as of yore the little loves In Paphos, and Idalia, or as still Warm from Albano's magic touch they breathe; Sportive as Zephyr, agile as the son Of Maia, when his infant hand deceived Apollo's piercing sight, and stole his lyre. Thus reason's structure shalt thou help to form, Laying the sure foundation, and avoid Their error, who the memory haply load With numerous words, and think their child endow'd With parts prodigious, should he get by rote Sonorous trifles, useless, and to him Incomprehensible; debarr'd meanwhile From action, which invigorates the frame, And every curious sense directs to things, Momentous, and substantial, understood At once, or by spontaneous efforts stamp'd On the sensorium, ne'er to be erased. Reject their error. Nor should strength of nerve To thy ill-fortuned offspring be denied, Should e'en his limbs more tardily perform Their office, and distortedly relax'd, Trembling sustain their burthen; heed the voice Of prejudice, or foolish tenderness, Which, nature's power unknown, would recommend Forbearance, and each slight exertion dread. Rather endeavour by repeated use To brace the fibres; exercise can string The slacken'd muscles, which their native tone Shall reassume, and conquer by degrees Hated deformity. Nor, should a cause Obscure, and singular, as such may be, Withhold him from the assiduous playfulness Which health and nature love; indulge the inert And heavy disposition; chide, invite, Force him to move; lest sullen apathy, And stupor, the phlegmatic habit's curse, To their devoted victim cling thro life. Without design, the lawns, and verdant fields, We introduced not; mid the rural haunts Was placed the tender nurseling; and from thence If possible, for many a rolling year Let nothing tempt thee with thy charge to seek The baneful town. The country boasts alone Untainted gales; the joys, and frolic sports Here revel; temperance here awhile defies Encroaching luxury, and beneath it's shades Primeval, lingers innocence of soul, And cherub-wing'd simplicity. Here dwells The unvitiated muse, and thro the glade, By Alphin's willow'd margin, or beneath His lofty elms, or mid his apple groves Thick blossoming, tunes the elegiac strain, Or meditates, as now, the instructive lay: Escaped from slavery, from the din of fools, From envy, and deceit, the treacherous crew, Who worse than fever or the pestilence Infect the city's mansions; here intent To meet Hygeia, and with her invert The garden mould, copartner of her toil, Or raise the drooping flower, or from the tree Prune its luxuriant branches; or ascend With her the swelling hill, or urge the steed Across the neighbouring down, or fledge the hook, And tempt the unwary native of the stream. Oh! thou propitious power! tho long exiled, The muse hath met thee here! Whence easier spring The ideas from their secret source, around Fancy once more her fairy visions spreads, Light is the destined task, melodious airs Inspire the bowers, and softer numbers breathe. If Sickness enter not the rural dells, Or vanquish'd by the purer atmosphere Give place to redient health; consider well What desperate ills thy children may elude Here educated, in whose veins yet flows Unsullied ichor, by the steams which rise, Mortal, and gross, in the throng'd city's bounds Unchanged. Nor regulate with anxious zeal Their pastimes and excursions, let them bend, As tutor'd from within, each pliant limb, Each mode of varied exercise essay, Enjoy their animation, and the sting Of innate sprightliness. Nor let them shun, Accustomed thus, the summer's noonday heat, Or winter's freezing sky. The inhabitants Of every region are by nature apt Its warmth, or cold to bear, its shifting winds, And quick vicissitudes: in frigid climes Still more alert, and stimulated more To necessary action. Oh! forewarn'd, Thy children in the stifling dome, howe'er Grateful to thee, include not; and misled By phantoms of imaginary harm, Superfluous vestments, tho defensive deem'd, Wrap not around them. So their vital powers To danger unobnoxious, shall repell All immature assaults; their nerves robust Escape the morbid tenderness of thine, Source of unnumber'd ailments; whence the mind Itself at length unhinged, is timid, weak, Irresolute, and to sensations doom'd, Which tho they must exist, can scarce be borne. Of polisht idleness which shrinks from toil, And cautious trembles at the external blast, This is the sad result. While all the tribes Uncultivated, whether in the wilds Canadian, or Brazilian, on the steep Of Caucasus, in Africa, or Ind, In the Malayan Isles, or those late seen By him, illustrious chief whose timeless fate Britannia mourns, and shall forever mourn, Whate'er erroneous customs they possess, Howe'er productive of peculiar ills, From this at least are free, this languor wan, These nervous horrors which o'erwhelm the soul: But from activity, from open skies, And the lustration of pellucid streams, Unmoved, support each accident of life, Cold, hunger, thirst, and pain; nay dauntless meet, And cheerfully resign'd, the stroke of death. Thus too of old upon Eurotas' banks, Or in the martial field near Tiber's waves, From hardy childhood, Lacedæmon saw, And Rome majestic, those intrepid bands, Which taught the sons of haughty Greece to stoop, Or subjected the world. To labour train'd From early years, thus, undebauch'd by courts, And softening indolence, in glory's page Enroll'd, and with her laurels deck'd, have shone Princes, and heirs of empire. Thus, advanced From Persia's borders, unrelax'd, and brave, Cyrus, whom Babylonia's walls in vain Resisted, and the myriads which obey'd Lydia's enervate monarch, while his crown He slavishly survived, and baser still Survived his liberty. Thus, mid the rocks Of Bearn, as lived the youthful peasant race, From them unknown, but by his royal mien, With feet unsandall'd, and uncover'd head, Henry, the future pride of France, was raised By kind maternal virtue. Hence he quell'd Iberia's modern Geryon; hence, the league That factious hydra gored with many a wound, And finally subdued: hence, graced his throne; And peace and plenty thro his realms diffused. Let then the sturdy boy unlimited Follow the bent of nature; nor too soon Enslave thy daughter; let her limbs possess Their utmost freedom to the extremest verge Which custom will permit. The lengthen'd walk, The more delightful ride, the mazy dance Whose rapid evolutions ever please, These, fashion, rigid decency allow, Whate'er her age: and if each day pursued In regular succession, will create That mode of happy texture, which attracts The lover's eye desiring; where the blood Speaks in the mantling cheek, but unsuffused With coarse and vulgar crimson; where the frame Is healthy, not robust, and elegant, Not delicately fragile. Purer minds, And gentler manners fancy here beholds, By peevishness untinctured, undisturb'd By malice and suspicion; nor perchance Views with illuded eye. For much the soul Depends on her companion. Exercise Too far impell'd, abnormous, and for years Continued, renders dense the nervous tide, Or to the seat of thought at length imparts Ideot rigidity. The effects of age Intemperate toil can prematurely bring On the worn frame, and sad untimely death. While idleness relaxing every nerve The mobile fluid is deranged by strokes Of slightest force, nor life is worth the name. What then do we advise? At first intent On the corporeal organs, nature strives To unfold, to strengthen them; and calls in aid Their own endeavours, restless, and untamed. In her more simple state, by keen desire Of food the loco-motive powers are roused; The savage else inactively reclines In his low shed, or underneath the palm, Or spreading cedar, if not urged to war, And its impetuous deeds, by hot revenge; Superiour swiftness and superiour strength His highest excellence, and only boast, The soul neglected, and to him unknown Its finer feelings, and extatic joys. But in those climes where polity hath smooth'd Our innate roughness, where humanely taught, By wholesome laws conjoin'd, by the intercourse Of liberal manners, and the incircling chain Of arts and commerce, there the faculties Of nobler birth are prized; the general-weal Defends each individual, who less heeds, Or values strength, except as far as health Asks his attention; nor the body sole, But mind, while gather the successive years, Parental notice claims. When this expands, Controul too fervid action, regulate Its wilder efforts. Social life requires The head considerate, and the labouring hand, Business and speculation, study deep, And enterprise which laughs at danger's frown, Tost on the stormy billows, or engaged In fighting fields. Whate'er his lot, adapt Thy child to vigorous deeds, or strenuous thought. Let exercise and books with mutual sway Divide his time well-govern'd. Who alone Pursues the hare, the fox, and bounding stag, Or pores unceasing on the mouldy page, Equal contempt and blame deserves. Nor fail If totally their charms engross the soul, Acute philosophy, or e'en the muse With all her softer beauties, to contract The span of life, to fill that span minute With languor, discontent, disease, and pain. Ere We conclude, this added verse receive, From Greece derived; for as of late immerst In rapturous thought, memory its chiefs pourtray'd Its sages, patriots, bards, Apollo's self Appear'd, or in my day-dream seem'd to appear. With him the car I press'd, which swiftly flew O'er continents, and seas; not swifter rush'd The trident-bearing God to Simois' plains, When under his immortal feet the woods, And thro their vast extent, the mountains shook. We gain'd Bœotia, where arose the cliffs Of Helicon, the impurpled lawn I trod, And to its top beyond my feeble ken, Ascended my conductor, where he join'd The expectant choir, whose harmony methought Far distant struck my ear. But on a bank With lotus and with hyacinth o'erspread Reclined the Ascræan poet, him I knew, For by his side was placed the verdant branch Of scepter'd laurel, which the muses erst With their own hands bestow'd, and bade him sing Their high descent, and all the ethereal race. His sheep were scatter'd round, and many swains, And many virgins with attentive ear Imbibed his flowing numbers, with the throng I mingled, and regretting that so late My footsteps had arrived, for now his strains Were well-nigh finish'd, and the sun declined Toward ocean's bed, with deep respectful awe Heard his last notes, while thus the master sung. “His anger ceased; for on the rocks which bound The solid earth, with adamantine chains Braced firm, Prometheus groan'd, while on his prey The screaming eagle darted from above. And Epimetheus too of vacant soul Had as a bride received the treacherous maid Vulcan's alluring work, with graces fraught Celestial, but diffusing evils dire. When now the sovereign Father bade convene The subject powers; soft pity fill'd his breast For new-created man; on golden thrones, They sat in order due; he thus address'd The assembled Deities. Ye Sons of Heaven Who on Olympus dwell, or ocean's waves Inform, or o'er the streams preside, or haunt The woods, and forests! with avengement just The traitor is exiled, who first presumed Our living fire to steal, who expiates now His guilt, and stretch'd upon the Scythian crags Horrific, lies exposed to piercing winds, Fierce-driving-rain, and snow, or beating hail, Which with unmitigable violence Assault his desolate abode. Nor fails Our ravenous bird at early morn to seek His nightly-growing feast. Such punishment From us he merited; nor have we spared His favour'd mortals, with Pandora's gifts Enchanted, by her blandishments subdued. But them we now with kinder eye behold, Ill-form'd to last, and verging to decay Hourly; no doubt with skill and care composed, Worthy their author, and with heaven's own flame Instinct, from our ethereal dome procured By fraudful stratagem; yet weak to bear The changeful elements, diseases fell, And accidental ills, a numerous train; Too exquisitely wrought, and destined soon Again to mingle with their kindred clay, Unless thelr fate some means yet unreveal'd Awhile protract; toward them my wrath relents, Not of themselves, from their own previous wills Originated, and to transient life From dust upraised. To you the means I leave Immortal powers. Who wishes to preserve The race terrestrial, hapless, and forlorn, From speedy dissolution, may explain Free, and unblamed the dictates of his heart. “He spoke. Then Pallas with attentive eye, Smiling, beheld the Deities around, Or pondering silent, or consulting deep. Smiling she sat; but graceful from her throne At length arose, and thro the effulgent hall, Proceeding o'er the jasper pavement, sought The door high-arch'd, whose valves of solid gold Spontaneous open'd; ere again they closed, The blue-eyed maid return'd, and by the hand Led, in the prime of youth, and blooming charms, A Nymph of heavenly mien, and as it seem'd A sister Goddess. On her cheeks was spread The glowing hue of Hebe; waving hung And loose her raven locks, but just confined; Her robe succinct a golden clasp upheld Baring the knee: Not languishingly soft Like Venus in her gait, nor rivalling Majestic Juno; but in all her limbs Dwelt symmetry divine, activity, And sparkling ardour; while her hand sustain'd A spear, too light for battles dire, in which Mars wields his massy javelin, but to feats Of mimic war adapted, or to wage The sylvan conflict. To the feet of Jove Led on, the assembled powers at once survey'd Her virgin form with wonder and desire, As from her breath perfumes, and from her hair Dropp'd fragrant roses. Then Minerva paused, And thus began. O Father! see, with thine How all my thoughts accord. The means I bring Thy clement aim to perfect; from their fate Suddenly threatening hapless man to save, And bless with length of days: by this my work, This beauteous nymph, whom I with plastic hand In emulation of Vulcanian skill, Or Promethean, fashion'd; not of earth, Or fire, like their productions, but of pure And elemental æther; nor by thee Forbidden, or with anger now survey'd. Her name Gymnasia, and in future times, And regions yet by mortal feet untrod, Health-giving exercise. For she the race Of men shall urge to exertion and to toil, Snatch from Pandora's arms the tender babe, String his young nerves, and thro the eventful scenes Of chequer'd life support him, scattering wide The mists of torpid indolence, the worst Of all the plagues, which in the fatal box Were stored, whose sweetness poisons, and the frame Weak of itself, to double weakness dooms. “She said. The Power superior, with a smile Approved her wisdom, with a smile that cheer'd Heaven, earth, and seas; viewing the lovely nymph Moulded by her, and by her skill adorn'd, The stedfast friend, and guardian of mankind. “They thro the yielding air with speedy flight Descended, hasting to the nether world; With acclamations loud Olympus rang.” END OF THE FIFTH BOOK. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. Address to Dr. Milman.—The Author declines treating particularly of the diseases of children.—The treatment of diseases in general cannot be taught to the vulgar; nor could those of children be contained in a work like this; much less could the skill and judgment be imparted necessary for the administration of remedies.—False notion, because children cannot describe their feelings, that the seats and causes of their diseases are therefore unknown.—Diseases of children not so simple as some have imagined.—The causes also are many and various.—Necessity of applying for speedy assistance. —This, even should it be unsuccessful, will hinder the remorse which might follow a different conduct.—The effects of this remorse exemplified in an Episode.—Inoculation. —Rise and progress of the Smallpox.—Introduction of Inoculation into Europe by Lady Mary Wortley Montague. —This duty inculcated.—Conclusion. To thee, whom laudable Ambition fires, Surmounting every obstacle, to climb The height of science, rivalling the fame Of Arbuthnot, or Garth, or learned Mead: With whom in life's gay morn my heart inwove A bond of union, which no power but death Can e'er untwine: whose warm, whose liberal voice Hath oft approved my strains, in this perchance Too partial, yet humane, and in the song Contemplating the friend: This verse to thee, Milman! as worthier of thy classic ear, I now devote; nor would I on thy time Sacred to public good, or studious thought, Intrude the futile levities of wit, Or useless elegance, howe'er refined. With prudence nursed, and by its precepts formed, Thy child, O Parent! haply will ascend Unhurt to manhood. Yet, events there are, Which not my lays can teach the means to shun, Nor thy assiduous caution can elude. For he is mortal, and to mortal ills Prone from his birth. Each violent disease The human race invading, may be his: And some, confined, exert their baleful force On infancy, and childhood. What, thy care, What, rural scenes, what the pure lymph and food Aptly supplied; what his own active powers Indulged, the frigid bath, and cleanliness, With regulation due of heat and cold, Can frustrate or prevent, and much they may, He will avoid. At least the shafts of death Shall oft be blunted, nature's vigorous arm Her shield protending, while her faithful aid Joins with thy ardent wishes. Is thy mind, Anxious, and fond, with this unsatisfied? And dost thou ask the latent plagues to view Skulking in ambush? know their different signs? Learn their prognostics, fatal or secure? And the resources which progressive time Hath found, and liberal practice can select? What wilt thou gain, so taught? Augmented fears, Doubled anxiety. In every look If slightly changed, in every wanton cry, Or sudden start, thy love solicitous The seeds of dire disaster will perceive, And haste with needless remedies to oppose A fancied mischief, till thy infant feels Perhaps thus often treated, real pain. Say, that disease were fixt, and that our page Lay full before thee fraught with justest rules; Could'st thou with timid mind, and throbbing heart, Presume to apply them? Would'st thou not, immerst In hesitation, all attempts forego? If not, the tone, and bias of thy soul Mistaking, we for such as thee ne'er strung The lyre humane, nor e'er the lyre will string. Yet, much the welfare of thy child we prize; And doubtless, even from his natal hour Beginning, could in graphic order paint Every distemper, each appropriate name Disclose, their diverse symptoms and their cure. And when the instructive plan we first essay'd, Imagination's inconsiderate eye Colleagued with youth, this finish'd work beheld. But judgment, render'd stronger by the lapse Of twice seven years, rejects the green design. A theme inelegant, for verse unfit, Tedious, and long, and barren, and to thee Of little profit, nay with danger stored. A task like this, the muse without regret Leaves to some Medicaster, who the quill, Dextrously wielding, aims at vulgar praise. We know the failure of generic marks Employ'd on species; near the bed of pain We know what nice distinction is required, What accurate serenity of thought, What sedulous attention, to collect Each circumstance minute; and from the traits Commingled and fictitious, to detach What suits peculiar natures, and the turns Of endless and immense varieties. Would then the mother, would the wary nurse, If such there be, from so disturbed a fount, To them disturbed, it's muddy waters draw? And sport with human life? Not thus reproach'd Shall flow my numbers, which the hand of rash Or doating ignorance shall ne'er supply With poison. Never will I stoop to win The multitude's applause by deeds or words Which candour must despise. Nor e'en in song Reflections cast on others, that on me May light the praise of fools; tho plausible Each note appeared, and for the common good Intended solely: much less with abuse Degrade the very art I once profess'd. For conscious of the toil it's practice claims, The inquietude, the watchful nights, the days To thought intense devote, when jovial mirth Holds its nocturnal orgies, and the voice Of empty vanity is heard at noon, Tho far beneath the illustrious great, I knew What form'd their sterling worth, and placed them high Above the selfish, mean empiric race. Such were the sages of the Asclepian line; Thus, from the Coan, to the incipient age Of Boerhaave, lived the prime of every school; Thus Sydenham, over every school supreme; Such Huxham lately ran his course of fame; While Glass with evening brightness still adorns The western sky, and proves not yet extinct The true, the genuine Hippocratic beams. Patient to observe, they, unremitting, scann'd The book of nature, while their souls enlarged Took in, and added to their proper store All past experience, methodized, and clear. How vain their labour! if a tract compiled By some assuming, specious shallow scribe, Could teach the inferior orders of mankind With strict discernment thro the tangled maze Of its progressive symptoms, to conduct Each dangerous malady, its cause unveil, And each adapted remedy prepare; Could these my strains embrace the various ails Infesting childhood, to thine eyes display The various antidotes, and give that sound Unerring judgment, which alone acquired By use and contemplation, can insure The proper time of trial, can advise With confidence, and justify the deed. Yet, what we may, what nor the muse forbids, Nor our own sense condemns, is freely thine. If from the mother's bosom we remove Those false opinions which her gentle soul Unwittingly possess; if we describe The limits of her care, and when to invoke Superior wisdom's aid; if on her mind Some duties we impress, and tyrant fear, And more tyrannic superstition drive Far from her dwelling; not in vain we write: And many a fell disease o'ercome, her sons, Her daughters shall hereafter bless the day Which brought these well-meant numbers to her ear. Because the child, with reason unendow'd And power of speech, by words to express his grief Nature permits not; some believe the source Of anguish and affliction is conceal'd From every eye, and deem assistance vain. Or to the nurse, or vaunting midwife trust, Who cases manifold and similar Have oft beheld, and never fail'd to cure: For each her nostrum boasts; if harmless this, And trifling, it were well, did not the wing Of time speed fast the irrevocable hour Of wish'd redress. But frequently the drug They praise, the cordial drops are fraught with death, Hurrying convulsions on of direst kind; Or with narcotic venom strong imbued, Plunging their patient in eternal sleep. Yet, nature, in thy child, tho not in words, Speaks plain to those who in her language vers'd Justly interpret. Are the different tones Of woe, unfaithful sounds? Can he, whose sight Hath traced the various muscles in their course, When irritated in the different limbs, Retracted, or extended, or supine, Fix no conclusions on the seat of pain? Is it of no avail to mark the breath, How drawn? the face? the motions of the eye? The salient pulse? the eruptions on the skin? The skin itself, constricted, or relax'd? The mode of sleep? of watching? heat? and thirst? From which, and numerous traits beside, arranged, Combined, abstracted, and maturely weigh'd, Judgment its practice forms? Are characters Like these, which ask the nice-decyphering soul, Intelligible to the beldames old, Who, wrapt in darkness, utter prophesies And lying oracles, which cheat the ear, Or follow'd, to destruction lead the way? Oh! may good angels, kindling in thy breast The lamp of reason, guard thee from their snares! Blind guides, assiduous to deceive the blind. Truths partially adopted oft admit Ingressive error. Children are presumed, As fresh from nature's hand, with maladies Of simpler kind to labour, than the frame Of grosser age. Say, this belief were true? A general rule? If simpler than they are Hence treated, still we cannot but decry The unsound opinion which for all alike One favourite mode of practice recommends. If just the notion, Æsculapius' Son Might as a vain intruder be dismiss'd, The mother could supply his place unblamed. But, nor with idle terrors do we seek To wound affection, from experience taught We know what medicines, different in effect, And opposite, the varying symptoms claim. Antiphlogistics which the vital heat Increased, depress; and Cardiacs which excite; And Opiate Sedatives, in vulgar hands Pernicious as the deadly nightshade's juice, And Drastics, which consummate skill alone, And wise discretion, when the moment calls, Should dare advise. The uncomprehensive mind, Or prejudiced, or wishing to repose In inactivity, is likewise prone To simplify the causes, and accuse That which perhaps exists not, but which reigns As it conjectures, eminent o'er all. The wild delusions which this source affords, With silent scorn or pity hath the muse Often attested. The luxuriant glands, In infants stiled of disproportion'd size, And the too copious fluids they secern, Or tough and viscid, some alone condemn. As if these glands by nature were ordain'd So large without design, or worse, to prove The cisterns of disease. Acidity Some only blame; and some, the sting severe Of acrimonious humours. These accuse The noisome worm, however hid from sight. Those, as exciting fever, reprobate Nought but the growing teeth. Repletion, some. While others dreadful fits survey within, Or e'en pretend to trace them in the smile Of downy sleep. Nor women solely err. The pedant has his whims; and he, the light Fantastic form, who superficial skims The froth of science, yet would fain appear Most intimate in its profoundest depths, Nor a phenomenon beholds, to which, Like the first man, intuitively wise, He cannot give a name. What strange conceits Have not philosophers embraced, intent The principles of Galen to defend! Or to deduce from chymic elements Recondite causes! Or the line apply And mathematie rule, to buildings raised On mere imaginary ground! Or search The moon, and aspects of the distant stars! While some, from animated beings, thick Diffused thro space, invisibly minute, Have every ill derived, tormenting man. Let all who will, enjoy their pleasing dreams, So human life be safe; and theory Held in firm durance, never guide the pen When sickness needs assistance. But, of this Be sure, O parent! to thy children flow From numerous causes, which would tire thy ear, And pass the stated limits of our verse, Their diverse ails; tho not perhaps like us Subject to putrid ferments, yet from them Not wholly free, nor from the power of cold, Of sultry heat, of humid air, and dry, And fell contagion, whose resistless aim If placed within its reach, no wight can shun Of mortal mould, nor e'er escape the bane, Unless around her favourites nature cast Impenetrable mail, no work of art. Shall then by fear impeded, none attempt To rescue childhood from distress and pain, But those, by long and toilsome study taught, To investigate the cause, the symptoms scan, And judge what they portend? The impartial heart Unmoved by sordid lucre, hy the goad Of mean self-interest, wishes to the race Of infant innocence, no worse a fate. But not to combat what the muses nine, And e'en the Delian God with all his power, Could never vanquish; and because the step Of Pæon's votary is not always near; Attend our strains. When the weak head declines, And the eye droops; when now the inconstant cheek Is red, now pale; when fretful, restless, hot; The stomach and intestines discomposed, And in their office changed; when the young springs Of life more quick or tardy feem to move Than nature wills; we would not to thy child Forbid thee, tho we dare not recommend, Nor can approve the deed, unless by fate Widely sequester'd from the experienced eye, Reason's sole plea; to give a portion due Of the Indian root; or taught the quantity With nice exactness, which his age may claim, Some useful Antimonial; or, that mild, Insipid, light, absorbent, by it's name Magnesia, better known, or join'd with this More strengthening Rhéum, from Siberian wilds, Or Turkey's regions brought. Here ends thy care: For now the transient obstacles o'ercome, Alacrity returns; or still he pines, Still his distemper gains increasing force. And if the cause should thus be deeply fix'd, Thy efforts would be vain, perhaps unsafe, At least engend'ring danger by delay, And danger often marches close by death. Here let thy love, thy conscience take the alarm; Love for thy child, and terror at the guilt Or dire infanticide. Perhaps the worst Of ills impends; convulsion lurks unseen; Fever already riots in his veins; Or suffocation threatens to destroy. Trust not thyself; trust not the babbling hag; Let fondness all alive, and light'ning round, Detect her, as Ithuriel's spear the toad, Couch'd at the ear of Eve, with poison fill'd. Yet shun despondence, cherish warmest hope, Seize fleet occasion ere it passes by, And call the ingenious Leach, his happy skill Shall to its pristine health thy babe restore, If all-o'erruling Providence permit. If not, to the indefatigable mind Tho learning all its mysteries hath reveal'd, Tho judgment clear, and long experience join Their potent aid, a Warren will be foil'd, A Heberden, or Baker, cannot save. But thou from every taint of guilt or blame Art free; thy duty is perform'd; tho poor That solace is, which counsels, be resign'd, Fetter the strong sensations, rapid-wing'd; And glean content from rectitude of thought. Who thus can lose the darling of the eye? The little lively cherub, who e'en now Begins his voice to modulate, and lisp The half-form'd tale? Ah! wherefore was he given? So soon resumed, and snatch'd from cheerful day? That, Heaven best knows. Yet, if thou wilt, indulge Thy just emotions, give them ample scope; Recall each mimic gesture, every sound, Each look, when pleased, or wayward in his mood, He struck with inexpressive tenderness The soul parental. With thy struggling heart The muse shall sympathise, shall add to thine Congenial notes sincere. But time shall heal The rankling wound, and soften by degrees, Nay, quite o'ercome reflection's sharpest pangs: Till memory tracing to the fount of grief Views it at length unruffled, and beholds Thro the calm lymph, woe's once detested form, Affectionately pensive, yet serene. The human soul with fortitude can bear, Or with elastic energy expell, Or slowly certain, vanquish every ill, But dread remorse. The self-accused descend Low in the scale, and abject, or they pine Afflicted, or amid the blaze of noon Perceive no change in the dark midnight gloom Which reigns within; despair stands scouling by, And sullen madness crouches for his prey. Oh! may thy mind, whatever doom'd to feel, Whate'er of anguish, pain, or penury, Wounds of ingratitude, or slighted love, This worse than all, than famine, fire, or steel, This horrid fiend avoiding, never shrink Beneath his weight, by conscious thought condemn'd. Nor, may Evadne's melancholy fate Be ever thine. What beauties could she boast! How fair, in virgin innocence! Her charms Pierced deep, for unaffected was the maid, And justest education had improved, Not tortured nature. Melody had chose Her voice for its loved vehicle of sound. Tho mute, she spake, her eye had magic fire. Her shape, her gesture, every action beam'd Expressive elegance. Could the young heart Of Polydore resist her wondrous power? He strove not to resist, he heard, he saw. And all his melting soul was her's alone. Nor did she view the enamour'd swain, or hear Scornful the tender vows he breathed; for his Was the smooth open front of candid truth, The modest cheek, the soft persuasive glance Of true affection, and the sigh sincere. The lawns, the meads beheld them, and the groves Of quivering alder, and the willows green Skirting the mazy brook, nor e'er beheld Happier and purer mortals; nor e'er caught Amid their shades, or on their mossy banks, Notes more impassion'd from the Doric muse, Than Polydore to his Evadne sung. Thus fixt immutably, thus rivetted By strong attraction, not a father's frown, For his imagination had pourtray'd Evadne in the higher rank of pride, Of wealth, and pageantry; not five long years Of absence could from either's heart erase The other's image. Yet again they met, Auspicious was the meeting; for the soul Of age severe, now moved, resolved to bless The constant youth, and to his arms resign The beauteous maid. He bless'd the constant youth; And to his arms the beauteous maid resign'd. Fair shone the morn of their espousals, fair The coming morn, and promised to the eye Of raptured love, a train of prosperous days. Oh happiness! how exquisite!—how brief! Affliction is the lot of man below: And often, misery, when the soul of joy Flushes with transport, breathes a sudden air Of chilling frost, the genial warmth destroys, And florid bloom. One eve Evadne sat Alone, in swift succession to her view Rose many a fairy prospect, but the light Which gilded them was Polydore's, the sun Was he, illuming, animating all The forms of her creation. Even then She felt his warm embrace, and press'd she thought His glowing cheek to her's; for him prepared, The table smiled; for him bright-beaming shone The rosy wine; the foot-steps of his steed She heard in every gale. But him, alas! The living Polydore she never saw. That steed had proved unfaithful to his trust, With mad'ning swiftness toward the gate he flew, While far behind his breathless master lay. The feelings of Evadne to describe Weak is the muse, and nerveless are her strains. What can support her? Where exists the power Which can detain her from the grave that holds Her lord in death? What, but the babe which smiles Unconscious of his loss, as on her breast, Her nurturing breast, he hangs? For him she lives. For him sustains the load of grief, and strives To tear the rooted anguish from her mind. He is the charm which reconciles her thoughts To the loath'd world? for Polydore in him She sees, in the dear pledge of amity: Stamp'd with his image, with his vital blood Inform'd, and breathing sweet his balmy breath. Hath not misfortune spent her deadly shafts? Ill-starr'd Evadne! In thy child appear The symptoms of disease, and onward hastes Impetuous fever. To a form like thine, A temper blameless, with emotions pure, Humane, and amiable, ah! why did heaven Refuse staid judgment, firmness to resist Error importunate, and strength to shun Credulity, which hears the dotard's tale, And thinks it truth! Who taught thy Grandam hoar The secrets of an art, to which the mind Of vigorous energy, and years of toil, Are scarcely equal? By what Demon urged Malicious, with what evil spirit fill'd Of self-conceit and folly, dares she hope To accomplish, what requires the searching eye Of genius, and the labour'd skill of deep And accurate attention? On thy child She looks, then proves her wisdom. First, the teeth Are blamed, and charms are tried, and nostrums given. Next, fits internal, and her poisonous drugs She brews like Circe. Then the noxious worm; And anthelmintics various she procures, And oft repeats the drench. Each different cause She e'er has heard suggested, is accused, And every remedy she ever knew, Administer'd; while still, the last, her voice Solemnly slow, declares will banish pain, And with miraculous and sudden force Restore the suffering babe; who lies meantime Opprest with double woe, by his disease, And that pernicious treatment, which from plain And simple, has converted it at length To mortal violence. Now, nature yields Reluctantly o'ercome. Evadne sees The victom of presumptuous ignorance; Conviction flashes on her mind; she calls For aid, too late. He dies; and with him dies Her Polydore again. She raves, she tears Her flowing locks. Yet, passionate excess May waste itself, and peace once more return. It might return, as when she felt the pangs Of absent love, as when her heart was torn, Losing its dearer portion. But the sting Of sharp reflection, by herself impell'd, What hand shall e'er extract? Her delicate, And feeling mind, imagination struck, Shrinks from existence; while by day, by night, These sounds pervade her ear, “Thy child is slain, And thou wert an accomplice.” Horrid sounds! Inviting on his cloud, the dreary shape Of melancholy madness. Oh! what notes, What different notes, utters Evadne now, Enfrenzied, and forlorn, from those which erst Amid their shades, or on their mossy banks, The groves responsive heard, the joyous groves Of quivering alder, and the willows green Skirting the mazy brook, those Doric notes, Which Polydore to his Evadne sung. Turn we from scenes like these, which o'er the soul Of weeping sympathy diffuse a gloom, Yet, not unchasten'd by the milder ray Of self-acquitting thought, and firm intent To shun the latent rocks of deep distress, By pious caution guided; from our theme Not thus abstracted, its preceptive notes Yet unrelinquishing, and sorrows mists Dispell'd, which o'er the breast of innocence Flit like a cloud across the summer sky; To happier mansions, objects of delight, And joyful prospects, turn! to where thy child Hath, by inoculation, overcome The plague Variolous! As Hercules The spotted snakes defeating, transport flush'd Alcmena's glowing cheek, so over thine I see the kindled radiance. Whether born In Ethiopic wilds, or mid the sands Of parch'd Arabia, or where spread the shores Girding the Caspian; from his natal place, Pursuing Mahomet's wide-wasting arms, The monster rush'd on Europe, pale dismay, Horror, and death rapacious in his train. For many a century, without controul, When raged his fury, by pernicious skies Aroused, or propagated far and wide By fell contagion, he destroy'd mankind. The cities groan'd; the matron o'er her babe In unavailing trance of anguish hung. The lover offer'd up his fruitless vows, And wearied heaven importunately fond, To save the beauty which his soul adored. The babe, the mother's self, became his prey; The youth, and virgin, sunk into the tomb. If life were granted, beauty was effaced; Each decent feature, tumid, and enlarged, Roughen'd, or dented with unseemly scars. Medicine was whelm'd with shame; the Roman page Was silent, nor the Grecian could afford An antidote for evils Grecia's sons Had ne'er imagined. Rhazes wrote in vain; And even Sydenham's efforts had their bounds. For the cold lymph by prejudice was shunn'd; And Sydenham, tho he oft by freer air Tamed the devouring heat, and shook the throne Of learned ignorance, declaring war Against its regimen, adverse to life, And compounds teeming with destructive fire, Alexipharmic poisons; could not change The rank malignant nature of the pest: Which still, when favouring constitutions reign'd And in peculiar habits, all his art Baffled, invincible; his art, beyond All mortals else, and only not divine. The triumph was reserved for female hands; Thine was the deed, accomplish'd Montague! What physic ne'er conjectured, what described By Pylarini, by Timoni sketch'd, Seem'd to philosophy an idle tale, Or curious only; She, by patriot love Inspired, and England rising to her view, Proved as a truth, and proved it on her son. A manly mind where reason dwelt supreme Was her's, the little terrors of her sex Despising, by maternal fondness sway'd, Yet bold, where confidence had stable grounds. How far superior to the turbann'd race With whom she sojourn'd, scrupulous, and weak! Yet, this is she, whom Pope's illiberal verse Hath dared to censure with malicious spleen, And meanly-coward soul. Redoubted Bard! What hath thy satire, though it often flow Happy, and poignant, with Horatian ease, What hath thy moral lay, though pure, and just, And elegant, of profit e'er produced, Of high advantage to thy natal land, Compared with her bequest? Thy numbers charm The listening ear, and with thy polish'd stile Taste is enamour'd; she hath been the cause Of heart-felt joy to thousands, thousands live, And still shall live thro her; thy song can please None but the sons of Britain; or the few, Of nice, and studious leisure; she unlock'd The springs of satisfaction and delight, And with perennial comfort bless'd the world. Let me then urge this duty; nor to fear Or superstition yielding, let thy child Encounter in his native shape the fiend, And brave his violence. For, whither, say, To what sequester'd haunt canst thou retreat, Where he will not pursue? How vain thy flight! How sure thy victory, if as art direct And wise experience, thou anticipate His threaten'd blow! So when the Patriarch's arm Was stretch'd to wound his son, an Angel came, And saved the victim from impending death. Gentle, and almost harmless is the bane By skill communicated, which regards The times and seasons, nor infects the child, If to dentition's wonted state arrived; For, ill the labouring frame can then endure An added stimulus. Nor yet before That period: lest to epilepsy prone By the contagious vapour raised, he quit Sudden the precincts warm of light and life. This too the cold of winter bids us shun, Potent the vessels to contract, increase Their tonic force, and in the system stir Fierce inflammation. And the summer heat; By which all putrid ferments are sublimed, And render'd doubly fatal. These extremes Avoided, in the temperate months alone Let every prudent matron be resolved To obey the call of duty, and of love. Unless the dread contagion, thickening round, Impell them to neglect each guarded rule, Yielding by force to peril's just alarm. Need we, in this our Æra, when mature, And vigorous, reason prospers, groundless fears Oppose by arguments? the groundless fears Of fondness, or religion? In thy mind No terror should, or can with justice dwell, But lest, as naturally seen, by art Unmodified, uncheck'd, the stern disease Should thy young charge assault. If he escape, His lot is fortunate. Assaulted thus, Oft, from an hundred only, many die. From many hundreds, none, or one perchance, Of those inoculated. Why should thine Be the poor solitary one? If death Follow a treatment, which can soothe the pest, And meliorate its nature, could his life Be granted to thy fervent prayer, when arm'd, And with its proper rage it took the field? This be thy source of comfort. Nor believe That Providence is tempted by the deed. From providence flows reason to mankind; And reason teaches us to fly from ill, And covet good. The invention, the success, Is the true warrant of approving heaven. Who would not rather cross a shallow frith, When first the rising tide begins, than wait Hemm'd in a nook, till with impetuous force It sweep him from his station? Who refuse By Franklin's pointed rod, to draw the stream Of lightning on their roofs, because the cloud Might harmless pass above? thus safe convey'd, In unterrific silence, to the ground. Tho rare the examples now, and scatter'd, mark The unhappy beings, who from idle dread, Or weak maternal love, in childhood's state This boon received not; and who sharing yet The hereditary feelings, want themselves Firmness of soul the omission to supply. Mark, where they pine in solitude, oppress'd By anxious thought; to whom man's cheerful race Affords no joy; the voice of music breathes Its choral notes unheard; the stage displays The living manners, and the assembly beams With sprightliness and elegance, in vain. The city, nay the village bounds they fly, And shift from place to place, as from the pack Of clamorous hounds and men, in wild affright The trembling hare. Oh! never may thy sons, Thy daughters, thus be cursed! in early life By thee from all these future horrors freed! The mirthful croud, with innocence of heart Joining well-pleased; the gay, the social hour Nor shunning, nor desiring, but awhile To soften care; or fit the soul for acts, By relaxation due, of nobler kind. Endow'd by thee with comeliness, no trace Of this abhorr'd distemper left behind, And all it's wonted ravages defied. For Montague again the verse prepare, And bring the harmonious strain! Why thro the realms Of Europe are not votive statues placed Honouring their benefactress? From the straits Of Gades, south, to where the towers ascend Of famed Petropolis? Or, crossing wide The Atlantic foam, why in the new-found world, Which more to her, than its discoverer, owes, Appears no structure sacred to her praise? Yet, shall imagination rear the dome, And fix the expressive marble. Hither come, Ye nymphs, and swains, with flowery garlands deck'd Your polish'd foreheads; on the shaven green Which fronts the temple, ply your nimble feet, The jocund dance inweaving! Hither come, Ye fauns and dryads! Hither, glowing love, And spotless beauty! Youth, with radiant eye, And blooming health! While underneath the beech Or oak, which waves it's consecrated shade, Humanity, and wisdom, smiling view The festive throng, mid whom the graces play. And quitting their proud bowers, and lofty hill, The muses utter notes divinely sweet, Such as of yore they sung, when gratitude Tuned to the friends and patrons of mankind The genuine lyre, ennobled by it's theme. END OF THE SIXTH BOOK. POEMS ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, NOT BEFORE PUBLISHED. ADDRESS TO PEACE. 1760. O virgin fair, with olive garland crown'd Thy polish'd forehead! Who with raptured eye Survey'st the waving harvest; when around From her full store the richest gifts are shed By plenty's hand unsparing; or if choice Thy footsteps guide to more sequester'd scenes, Attentive to the turtle's melting note, Wafted by echo's busy, sportive voice Thro the green glade! O Queen of every charm Soft vanquishing the human breast; adored Tutoress of science, of each art refined, Existing first by thy creative power, By thy enlightening influence sustain'd! Thee too the Idalian tribe, the smiling loves, And graces, interweaving mutual bands Of rosy twine, thee the Pierian nymphs Applausive view, and hail with dulcet hymns, Genial Inspirer; from their sight exiled, They droop their languid heads, no more the beams Of warm imagination fire the soul Of their deserted votary. He adapts His lyre in vain to smooth melodious airs, Harsh, grating discord jars on every string. Oh! where chaste nymph, shall I begin to praise Thy matchless beauties? how, attractions paint Innumerable? the quick thought shrinks back, Nor dares attempt the complicated theme. And yet our conscious bosoms know, and feel The blessings sprung from thee; Albion exults Through all her fields, joy and contentment reign, And Agriculture holds his plough, and smiles. Fortunate Isle! or more—Beloved of Heaven! Surely expell'd from every other land Beneath the ethereal cope, on dubious wing Traversing the vast globe, here Peace restrain'd Her weary flight, here fix'd her stedfast throne, And stretch'd her golden sceptre, while o'er all The liquid realms thy floating bulwarks ride In triumph, big with horror and dismay, Far off to bear the fiery war, and awe Resisting nations. She meantime secure, Upon thy borders all her balmy dew Showers unwithdrawing; on a thousand hills Feed thy large flocks, throughout a thousand vales Resound thy lowing herds, thy rivers bear With pain the load of commerce, and thy towns Receive the tribute of remotest lands; Here either India's bounteous gifts are spread, Here the collected wealth of every clime. Ah! how unlike to these were the dire scenes Witness'd of old! when civil tumult urged The rival claims of Lancaster, and York; As sway'd by desperate chiefs, then Britons fought Against contending Britons. Horrid sight! Compell'd to war, tho consanguineous streams Together mingled on the accursed ground. Ah! how unlike, when fierce rebellion raged In all her terrors clad! When, impious man, Cromwell, by wily arts, religion deem'd, And holy zeal, prompted the infuriate bands, Enthusiastic, to dethrone their King, And mocking sacred justice, lead to death The royal victim.—Gracious Heaven! remove Such woes, such crimes forever! Nor again Should treason, in despite of lawful sway, Wave her dark crest, as by the North e'erwhile Upraised, let her not meet rebuke severe, And swift avengement. Never may a fiend So ugly, so detestable, be born In British soil: but may soft placid gales Of concord whisper thro the land; may all The powers of harmony conspire to form A lasting guard, a wall impregnable, Around young Brunswick's throne, and fix his reign On the firm basis of his people's love. O Nymph divinely sprung! Ethereal Maid! Hear the fond wish! Still beam thy purest ray, Dazzling audacious faction; gently smile, And party shall unfurl her wrinkled brow, Catching humanity; in social bands Connected, tell thy Britons they may dare Defy the universe; much less may Gaul Hope to resist their power, 'tis her's to sit With envy swoln, and utter threats in vain. Unhappy Gaul, what generous foe but heaves, Reflecting on thy fate, the sigh humane! Where is thy robe of triumph now, the robe Of purple grain, which o'er thy glittering arms Thou wont to cast! Why at thy feet reclines That dinted shield? What means the broken spear, And edgeless sword, beside thee placed? Why sinks Thy downward eye, as if ashamed to view Yon ruin'd trophy? Where is now thy pomp? Thy glory's radiance? Where the flattering hopes Of conquest, and invasion? Either Ind, Torn from thy empire, owns Britannia's sway. Where are thy crouded fleets, by the bright plumes Of golden commerce fann'd from shore to shore? Why scouls around thy land, where plenty smiled, The meagre form of nerveless poverty? Such are the fruits of dire ambition, such The baneful gifts of War, before whose face Glide pleasing phantasms, fair delusions, dreams Of sure success, and splendid victories won. False glitter all! Behind strides horror, pale, And ghastly; fell despair, whose murderous hand Seeks his own life; famine, with hollow eyes, And body wasted to the bone; inwrapp'd In storms, and whirlwinds, whose resistless force O'erwhelms whole provinces, and bares the earth, Sweeps desolation; miseries worse than death; The cries of orphans, suffering matron's groans; Anxieties and griefs immense; woes more Than language can describe, or fiction frame. These are the followers of remorseless war, By frantic rage impell'd to thin mankind. Such now o'er poor Germania's harrass'd soil He drives his fervid chariot; not of yore Louder his voice was heard on Thracia's hills Urging his loved Edonians to the field. Roused at the sound, in dread array, her sons Pant for the fight; here dauntless Ferdinand Meets the thick tempest of impetuous France. There Austria sends her valiant legions forth, Prepared for hardiest conflict; to her aid Lured by the hopes of plunder, their bleak wilds, And snow-clad hills deserted, onward haste The rugged Russians; cruel, fierce, untamed, Ruin, and brutal havock mark their way. Who shall the savage multitude oppose? Who nations, leagued with nations? On his brow Sits fortitude, while prudence spreads around Her tutelary wings, and valour goads His ardent soul, instinct with highest thought, Defying peril, and the front of death. A soaring spirit, undepress'd by fate, He bears; Immortal Frederic! Lo! when gain'd A transient rest, he wakes the Lesbian lyre. At every touch I hear a Master's hand Explore the chords; as if the favouring Maids Of Helicon, their violet-shaded fount Had left, and danced exulting at his birth, While blue-eyed Pallas saw, and praised the deed. Yes, let the fickle many, as they list, With fortune's giddy tide retract their course; At least one Briton shall with thee, O Prince, The torrent stem of black adversity, And weave a radiant chaplet for thy brow. For surely justice bade thee draw the sword Against thy treacherous foes.—But if instead, By mean ambition led astray, thy soul Grasp'd at the hopes of conquest, the false pride Of overthrowing kingdoms, should a Bard, Should thy own strains self-flattering, e'er attempt Thy crimes to palliate, may the abortive work Perish unheeded! never shall the muse Of genuine poesy adorn thy name; But snatch it Infamy! and waft it on To the dark shades, where mute oblivion reigns. Blasted be all, who harbour thoughts like these! Who unprovoked, let loose to tear the world The wasteful furies, who, for deeds of blood, Quit the mild virtues of humanity; And to emblaze their glory, sport away The lives of thousands. With a fix'd contempt Tho glittering in the spoils of half the East, Tho worshipp'd as the progeny of Jove, I view the Æmathian tyrant. Not the tribes, The prostrate millions, from Siberia north, To distant Iran; not the imperious Turk Vanquish'd by Stella's mountain, not the crown Reft from the Egyptian Soldan's head, himself Compell'd o'er Afric's torrid plains to roam A fugitive, from me extort a word Applausive of the Scythian Homicide. Where justice fails, there fails the nerve of war, The sinewy strength, which gripes, and fast retains True glory; when the sacred flame inspires Of freedom, when the invigorating love Of his dear country to the mortal strife, Impells the Hero's courage-breathing soul, His fame, not rancorous envy's tainted tongue Can with malignant poison dare imbue; But her black snakes drop their convulsive folds, Hissing involuntary praise. To him Should victory present the splendid palm, Meed of his brave emprize, and having borne Safe thro the terrors of the ensanguined plain, Lapp'd in her blooming mantle, lead him back To realms, his toil, his virtue hath preserved; For him, with liveliest admiration join'd, Shall gratitude effuse the enchanting voice Of heart-felt, rapturous joy; him meet the youth With gladsome shouts, and all the virgins hail With choral song, or thro the mazy dance In tuneful cadence ply their airy feet; While in his breast a double share of bliss Extatic swells, and all his conscious mind Is fraught with strong, with exquisite delight. But should the fates his wish'd return deny, And death resistless strike the mortal blow, Lo! from his feeble arm the uplifted sword Unnoticed drops; valour beholds no more His ardent glance, shot from the enkindled soul. Yet still on her his swimming sight he throws, On her, and liberty, as o'er his wounds In tenderest grief they sprinkle the salt tear, And pleased to engage their pity, smiles and dies. Hallowed by them, what yet survives, his name They guard with purest zeal; at their command Heaven-nurtured truth assumes her golden pen, And opes the historic page; at their command Obedient sculpture lifts the pious urn, And animated bust; they speak, and all The Aonian nine tune their melodious strains: Or graved on adamantine tablet, fame Suspends them high in her eternal dome, That latest times may read, admire, and love The man, who when his country call'd him forth, Devoted bled.—Such, amid Indian wilds, Fell gallant Howe; such, prodigal of life, Upon Canadian shores, illustrious Wolfe Resign'd his patriot soul. Oh! early lost! From thy full noon, what glories hope portray'd, So bright thy morning beam! to last, too bright— Soon overwhelm'd by the dark clouds of death. Benignant Power, from whom my numbers spring! Ah! what avails it, that our groves, our lawns Enraptured own thy presence; that around Our coasts, is flung, productive of soft ease, Thy genial girdle; if on foreign strands Our chosen Heros are condemn'd to expire, A prey to the stern furies? if the waves, Where'er they roll, are tinged with British blood? Lo! from beyond the vast Atlantic surge, To where the Ganges pours his mighty stream, Flooding the Orient, War hath fix'd his sway, Grim slaughter waves his crimson flag, on high Revenge directs her course, and far and wide Echoes the yell of discord. Oh! appear, Long absent, to the labouring world; disclose Thy virgin charms, deck'd in thy silver vest, Advance with modest step, and strait abash'd Each monster shall retort his felon brow, Or envious, look askance, but all too weak To glut their rage on thee, shall in their flight Desperately rend each other; while behind Vengeance shall raise his livid arm sublime, Shaking a whip of scorpions, far beyond The flaming limits of the world, to urge Their way, amid the jarring elements Immerged, fit habitation. Thou shalt seize The rod of empire; happy in thy smile The nations shall rejoice. I see the quick, The wondrous change; I see before my eyes The gayly-shifted scene; the realms of Peace Lye open to my view; I taste, I feel The balmy zest of pleasure, as my steps Pervade the lovely range; sure Nature here Unsullied wantons; here Favonius sports; Tricks his light plumes, or on the blushing cheek Of Flora, hangs enamour'd. I behold Arcadian plains, verdant as the green banks Of lily-sprinkled Ladon, famed of yore For agile satyrs, fauns, and shepherd gods, The train of Pan. Verdant, as meet the sight Of old Penéus, where his course he winds, Thro scenes romantic, Daphne's loved abode, Thro Tempe's hallow'd groves, and flowery lawns. Ah! who will lend their succouring hand to guide My feeble steps to the aerial height Of yonder craggy mount, whose pine-clad top Wars with the clouds! thence wide outstretch'd, the view Mocks the beholder's farthest ken, arise In mix'd confusion, towers, and tufted trees, And sheep-deck'd hills, and crouded towns, and seas, Smooth as the glassy mirrour. Oh! I long In some purpureal vale at ease to rove With yon gay band, in festive garments dress'd, Their burnish'd arms, now useless, hung aloft Amid the laurel shade. With them recline Beneath some spreading beech, or oak, whose roots Bathe in the brook beneath, and whose large limbs Deny all entrance to the noon-tide beam; Attentive to each soul-arresting tale Of war, of bloodshed, and of sieges dire, Rencounters fierce, and victory hovering o'er With dubious wing.—Thence turning, I espy A mazy path, deep thro the sacred grove It seems to wind; a solitude serene; Except what artless symphony dispense The feather'd race, in many a liquid trill, From every springing shrub, and moss-grown tree. Herb I proceed, nought fearing lest the charms Tempt to betray, or as in times of yore The red-cross Knight, thro such a specious track, Startled, I view the den of Error foul, Dread monster, soon by his sharp-pointed steel Laid low.—This brings to the delicious bowers Of Peace, the tranquil region of her sway, Aloof from prying boldness. May I dare Enter these bless'd retreats, where fancy sees At every turn ideal beings move, Exceeding human far! here stalks along Musing, and solemn, contemplation slow, Cross'd are his arms, his stedfast looks are bent Inward, and rapt he seems in extasy. There sits philosophy, his wrinkled front And hoary head proclaim him old, but young And vigorous is his mind, and active soars Amid the stars; here virtue walks, array'd In dignity august, yet simply grand, Unstudious of attire; on either side Two sweet companions, modesty the one, Of blushing cheek, the other innocence, Known by her spotless zone. The smiling form Of boon content, lock'd hand in hand with health, Speeds o'er the level surface of the green. Here fairy fiction weaves her painted stole, The colours from the bright ethereal woof Of variegated Iris taken. Here The Muses daily sing, and all night long Ceaseless entwine the many-sounding threads Of harmony. Rapture with greedy ear Attends. My gazing eyes transported view The glowing face of love; the nimble gait Of florid youth, sallying with keen desire To where beneath the myrtle's odorous shade Beauty awaits his coming.—Oh, ye powers! Ye airy substances, Oh! tell me where Is she whom you adore? Who gives you all Unruffled, in these woods, these caves, and streams, To walk, to lye, to bathe your graceful limbs; Who from your presence drives the rout profane Of dissonance, and tumult. Tell me where Now in the silent noon she dwells retired. In yon refreshing grot, around whose sides The clinging woodbine, and the fragrant briar Luxuriant rove; where the rich jasmine sheds Its bounteous pérfume, at whose entrance rise Spontaneous flowers, where springs the primrose pale, The cowslip, and much-varied pink, the rose, The daisy meekly clad, the violet sweet, With all the incense genial Maia yields. I see her! O Immortal! by the choir Of winged songsters, by the elysian gales Fanning thy grotto, by the liquid pearls Which drop by drop down from the arch'd roof fall, By thy own auburn ringlets, by the fire Mild-beaming from thine azure eyes, the smile Dimpling thy cheek, thy sweetly-breathing lip, That soft serenity which gently plays O'er thy whole frame, by each attractive grace, Each placid inmate of this holy seat, Oh! listen to my prayer! With aspect bland Pardon that rashness, which with giddy step Urged hither my unhallow'd feet. Forgive That all-unskill'd in song, my youthful lays Rough, and uncouth, have jarr'd thy purer sense With harsh disturbance. Yet, if I have err'd, To the blind impulse of mistaken zeal Impute the unguarded deed. Thee I adored From earliest years; thee, now the rising down Shadows my chin, with added warmth adore. And dost thou hear indulgent? Nay benign Approve my verse? Oh blessing, far beyond My utmost hope! Still shall my vows be paid To thee, with true devotion; and compell'd With care to sojourn, to the busy paths Of life exiled, still shall my ardent love On thee be fix'd: thee will I oft invoke With fond regret: and haply tho condemn'd Ne'er more to pierce these Academic shades, Thy visions not unfrequent, may be spread Before my sight: thy form divine appear, And tune to melody the new-strung lyre. On TAKING the HAVANNAH. Mourn, mourn Iberia! prostrate in the dust Lay thy once-haughty form! while thus breaks forth The deep, impassion'd anguish of thy mind. “Accursed be those, eternal bane pursue, And taint with blackest infamy their names, Who first with impious counsels dared advise To join my aid, and help the sinking state Of ruin'd Gallia!—Never more may peace Attend their footsteps, who so rashly framed The boasted compact!—Fools! who did not think What enemy they roused to venturous deeds. Who did not, tho by sad experience taught, Reflect on days of yore, and thence foretell Confusion to their hopes.—Have I not seen Edward, tremendous in his sable arms? Have I not often heard the dreaded name Of Raleigh? oft of Drake? Have I forgot When all the riches of our western world Vigo beheld, or taken, or in flames? Or when Gibraltar lowly-stooping, sigh'd O'er her scaled bulwarks? Or, when urged by fame Heroic Peterborough laugh'd to scorn Numbers, and strength superior, having fix'd His standard on the subjugated walls Of Punic-built Barcino? Dauntless soars The British spirit, holding undepress'd Its glorious way. Oh, Britain! Oh, adorn'd By our disgrace! triumph, and bliss are thine, Mine is despair. Oh, Cuba! word of joy Erst, and delight, now of reproach, Oh, Isle Beloved, how art thou torn from my embrace, Perhaps forever!”—Thus Iberia, mourn, By day, by night, nor rear from off the earth Thy weak, enervate limbs.—But thou rejoice Oh, Antillean Genius! shout aloud, And call thy Nymphs around thee from their grots, And caves, call forth thy Dryads from their groves Breathing perfumes. Bid sound the sprightly song; Bid lead the frolic dance: And say “Rejoice With me, ye Nymphs, rejoice ye virgin train! Again delighted range my woods, my dells, And wide savannahs. Now arrives the day Long time by me invoked, to oppress with woe The fell Iberian race, whose cruel minds, Hard, and unfeeling from the lust of gold, Prompted their willing hands to extirpate My old inhabitants; e'en hoary heads, And tender years for mercy cried in vain. Then did the heavens weep blood, in agony The mountains trembled, and the chafed ocean Lash'd the resounding shores with indignation. I o'er my face my mantle threw, and struck With inexpressive horror, inly groan'd. You shriek'd, and wildly ran to hide forlorn, In dens, and caverns, never visited By Sol's intruding splendor, where you might Indulge the potent grief which wrung your souls. But now the time is come, the time to cease Your ejulations, and cast off the weeds Of sorrow.—Vengeance on them lowers, his form Gigantic shades the land, his quiver bears Its winged shafts terrific, he essays His strength, and preluding, to contact draws The points of his renitent bow. He calls Far from the north, from the white-clifted Isle, The sons of war; by rapid winds impell'd, They speed across the Atlantic. Brave their souls; And proud in conscious worth, they view unmoved The frown of death. Their Enemies dismay'd, And anxious, droop.—What numbers soon to fall! Their firm-ribb'd ships, high-towering o'er the deep, In vain protect them, their strong gates in vain, And force-defying ramparts, and in vain Velasco, best, and bravest of his kind; Whom, had not hate hereditary steel'd My nerves, I should behold with pitying eye. His efforts fail, and on the well-fought breach Lo! he expires! Now Vengeance drench'd in streams Of reeking crimson, leads his heroes on, And now the Isle is theirs. Oh! gratulate The valiant, the avengers. May they ne'er Restore the conquest; grant it not ye Powers, All, who detest injustice!”—In the prayer Of Cuba's Genius, Thou Britannia join! Say to thy sons “Hold fast this matchless prize, Transcendent o'er the Caribbean Isles, Pride of the western Ind! Reject her not, Lest other nations tauntingly observe, Thus fight Britannia's progeny in sport, Thus waste their treasures, and the generous blood Of those, whose valour awes the astonied world. Ah! if her stores of aloes, and of myrrh, And fragrant cassia, her delicious fruits, Worthy of Paradise, which might enchant A second Eve, her hills clad with each tree For use, or ornament, her sugar'd fields, Her luxury of charms, cannot entice And win you to possession, yet let not My enemies insultingly reproach Your easy folly, nor become the tale Of scorn, and laughter to perfidious Gaul.” On GENIUS. Say, what is Genius? with the human form Is it connate? or is it gain'd by years, Like the corporeal efforts? Its prime food Is vivid inclination to excell. By emulative warmth, and love of fame Its growth is cherish'd, industry and toil Clothe it in strength and beauty. Oft its powers Torpidly slumber, till a fervid ray Impell'd by chance, awakens them to life. Yet we affirm that nature must adapt Each fibril, bearing to the source of soul External impulses; must to the brain Impart its happy texture, to receive, Retain, renew, associate, or reject Those multiform impressions, which each sense Thither conveys. Else, strong desire would fail, No works, but those of hebetude appear, Or phantoms of inanity. The brain Completely moulded, its auxiliar nerves With quickest sensibility endued, We the foundation trace, tho nice, yet sure, On which, colleaguing with attentive care, Incumbent o'er his many-colour'd mass, His vast collection of ideal stores, Genius those structures elevates, which strike The admiring eye, and claim immortal praise. For now, unknown at first, by due degrees The qualities are his, which only stamp His mental frame and character exact, Judgment, and taste, and elegance.—Observe Where youthful rapture gazes on the page Of fairy poesy; seizing the pen, He tries, he fails; again, again he tries, As often fails; yet eagerly pursues His daring plan, to equal, to surpass His favorite prototypes, and round his brow Twine laurel wreathes. He darts his curious eye O'er nature's face, examines, and compares The copy with the original, acquires Himself ideas new; abstracts, combines, Assimilates, and modifies them all A thousand different ways; a stile, a grace, A manner of his own at length he boasts, And scorns weak imitation. These are toils, The free indeed, and the spontaneous toils Which nurture Genius, and which constitute His finest pleasures.—Why, with strong desire, With seeming equal ardour in the chace, Does excellence another's grasp elude? Because his nerves, or that ethereal, pure, Elastic fluid which pervades the nerves, Have diverse modes of action, are unfit Impressions fine, or vigorous, to convey To the warm seat of thought; or else because The brain not duly textured, only feels Sensations blunt or faint, with efforts faint Reflected, and confused. From nature then Alone is genius sprung, at least she gives That mechanism of parts, to which he owes The very capability of life. Earlier, or later, whether chance excite, Or inclination fire, she to the bard Imparts his numbers, she harmonious sounds To masters of the lyre, to painters tints Of loveliest hue, and bright ideal grace. She fixes deep, and she diversifies The thoughts of men, and stretches out the bounds They ne'er can pass. Her stamina to change, Transcends all mortal skill; else Johnson's strains, Had vied with Shakespear's, Whitehead's equall'd Gray's. We must be what we can, not what we will. Leisure, and opportunity, and chance, And ardent emulation, nought avail To raise up genius, if the organic tone By nature is denied. The general race, In science, and each art they cultivate, Haply by unremitting labour taught, May partially excell.—But how unlike Is genius? and how rarely shines reveal'd His dazzling aspect!—In four thousand years, One Homer, and one Shakespear have arisen. Virgil himself, is but of second rate, Compared with them. One Newton time hath seen In his vast journey. Yet the scale abounds With numerous gradations. In the realms Of swarthy Afric, mediocrity Itself is genius; far beneath that point Myriads are fix'd, till scarcely intellect Exceeds the Oran Outang's.—All depends Join'd with the swift transmissive power of nerve, On the sensorial energy of brain, Its shape, and size, and weight, proportionate To the whole frame. Largely with this supplied, Had a still larger volume been assign'd, Half-reasoning elephants had reason'd quite. A trifling weight haply the balance turn'd Between a Tully, and a Catiline, A Marius, and Metellus.—Nature's hand Is visible throughout; no force of art, No labour, cultivation, fervid hope, Industrious effort, can avert the blight Of her frugality.—Yet in its birth, Genius may be extinguish'd by disease, Strangled by poverty, sunk in the dust By stern oppression, or by indolence Cursed with perpetual barrenness of mind. But give the tone of brain, the nerves which bear Faithful impressions strong; give the mild sun Of opportunity to dart its rays; Give leisure, curious search, the strenuous thought Aiming at worth superlative, give time Which solely perfects wisdom; and the form Of Genius will arise, on eagle wing To soar to heaven, or with a lynx's eye To penetrate the abyss, to associate all The charms of beauty, grasp the true sublime, Add novel tints to fancy's rainbow dress; Or separate the clouds by error spread, Till all the gloom is vanquish'd, and the light Of intellectual day wide-blazing streams. To INDEPENDENCE. 1787. Hail Independence! on thy sacred altar I heap devoutest offerings.—If misled By phantoms of imaginary good, From thy rough path sublime, from the keen air Thy mountains breathe, my steps have turn'd aside Tho but an instant, or a thought escaped Toward the low vale, or thick o'ershading grove, If thus my soul e'er felt a transient wound, The flaw of weak mortality forgive! And let me, strenuous task, forgive myself! While smoothed the scar, and re-inspired by thee, Doubly enamour'd of thy form august, Erect I move, and with unblushing face Claim thy alliance; and in solemn strain Swear never more from thy bright track to cast A devious look; or injure, what no wealth Can ever recompence, no fame obtain'd From the rank vulgar, ever can repay, That conscious honour, that nice sense of worth, O'er which the firm, and unsequacious mind In secret broods, exulting as she tastes The true, luxurious pleasure.—That I first Beheld the light, free-born, on Albion's coast, Nor yet among the meanest of her sons, Necessitous, to penury exposed, My grateful thanks to Heaven are due. Oh shame! These blessings to degrade, confine my limbs With golden shackles, and descend beneath, In voluntary abjectness of soul, Not only the poor hind who guides the plough, But the pied-coated beggar. Have I drank At the clear stream of science? Have I read The stoic lesson? and in groveling wise Shall I so stoop, and call myself a man, In flattery to my equals, my inferiors, However with the gifts of fortune cramm'd, That e'en my dog, if granted words and sense, Would cry, how I despise thee!—Not from this, From this alone, O Goddess of my prayers! Defend thy votary; but inspire me still With that unyielding spirit, which resists Pride's domination, and with fix'd contempt Eyes the malicious scorner. While in vain The many-acred blockhead thinks to find Me on his nod attendant, at his smile Cringing, and with officious haste his will Anticipating, e'er his tongue command, Haply when he despairs of life, and craves Art's sage assistance, to receive the few Vile counters, by necessity extorted, Which he so dearly estimates; to me, Which are but glittering nothings.—Yes, pursue Such modes of action, call them politic, And thrive by them, who list. I know mankind As well as they, and know base humours please The base, that feign'd respect appears as real, That few, from self-complacence, can escape The flatterer's bait, and twenty saws, to prove That men, like callow birds, are oft the prey Of reptile sharpers.—But I know myself, And will not, cannot pay the price for goods I deem of sordid grain. The price not paid, In the world's ware-house let them rot for me, Or clothe the backs of fools, and prodigals. Fools, who on gew-gaws set a value, far Beyond their worth intrinsic; prodigals, Who in exchange, give what exceeds all price, Sincerity, integrity, and honour. Yet Goddess! would I not austerely dwell, A solitary Being. While I trample Malice, and spleen, and pride, beneath my feet, The good, the just, nay, e'en the rich, and great, If rich in virtue, and if great of soul, Claim, and shall have my reverence. They are form'd For all mankind, I own them form'd for me, Nor would I boast of independence here. Neither the ties of nature would I loose, Stifle the fond affections, quit the duties Mild, relative, reciprocal, nor fail To bend with anxious care to those beneath me. The high-o'eruling, independent, one, Essence of essences, supremely blest, His creatures, tho so infinitely low, Sustains, preserves, with mercy and with kindness Shrouding from human view his aweful sway, And stern-eyed justice.—Pride is madly-fierce, Wresting from all alike insulted homage, But triumphs most o'er the depress'd, and weak. True Independence fears not to be humble; Hating servility, she renders light The weight of obligation; bids the wretched With confidence uplift the timid eye; Bids them approximate, and joins herself.
