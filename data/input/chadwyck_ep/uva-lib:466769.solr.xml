      <field name="fulltext">“Who buys Blackberries?—Asking, sir, your pardon, Can't you bring us something that will sell at Covent Garden?” “Flourish Covent Garden, and Paternoster Row; But let the birds and gypsies their own ways go.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOR ANYBODY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BRAMBLE-HILL. Not much to find, not much to see, But the air is fresh, the path is free, On a lonely Hill where bramble grows In tangling clumps, and the brooklet flows Around its feet with whispering. Leaf-tufted are the twines in Spring; The goldfinch builds, the hare has her form; And when the nightless days are warm, When grass grows high and small flowers peep, Far and wide the trailers sweep Their pinky silver blossoms, which Are braided with a delicate stitch. The berries swell with Autumn's power; Some are red and green and sour, Some are black and juicy to bite, Some have a maggot, some a blight. Then frost-nipt leaves hang rusty and tatter'd, With sleet and hail the bushes are batter'd, A thorny brake on the barren hill, Where the whistling blast blows chill. But under the snow, amid the dark, Sleeping waits the vernal spark. I had neither garden nor park. On Bramble-Hill, by brake and stone, Many a season I wandered lone, With laughter, and pray'r, and singing, and moan; In gray mist and in golden light, Under the dawn, and the starry night. Not much to find, not much to see; But the air was fresh, the path was free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DAWN. Creat Morning in our sky once more, Enkindling land and wave,— To bring a day like all before, And find me still a slave? No! let me date my years anew; This day is virgin white; By Heaven, I will not re-indue The rags of overnight! I was a king by birth, and who Is rebel to my right? None but myself, myself alone: Conquer myself, I take my throne. [To plan a wise life, little pains doth ask] To plan a wise life, little pains doth ask; To live one wise day, troublesome the task. And why so hard? what is it thwarts me still? A morbid memory; a divided will; A weak and wavering faith, which for mere shows And shams of things forsakes the truth it knows. [Suppose we tried the simple plan, to say] Suppose we tried the simple plan, to say No lies at all, for just one single day. Would houses crumble into heaps of sand, Fields wither, sky fall, ocean whelm the land? [O life, made up of hints and moods and fine transitions] O life, made up of hints and moods and fine transitions, Great secrets murmur'd low, pure joy in fleeting visions! [To fight the World's a weary strife] To fight the World's a weary strife; Shun it, who lov'st a quiet life. To fight thy own true self is worse, And victory the consummate curse. [Thou Great One! help a poor weak man] Thou Great One! help a poor weak man To do and live the best he can. [Lord, make me fit for heav'n!—but nay] Lord, make me fit for heav'n!—but nay, That is too bold a prayer to pray: Fit for this common world, I'll say, This wondrous world of night and day. [Speak but one word beyond cavil or doubt!] Speak but one word beyond cavil or doubt! But once from the Infinite Deep look out! On rock, on mire, my footstep slips; And even the prayer dies on my lips. —Nay, as it is, so must it be: Shall the Plan of the Worlds be changed for thee? [Tease not conscience, rack not wit] Tease not conscience, rack not wit; Take a quiet look at it, This great world, strange and fair, In which you also have your share. [Take heed, take heed! the petty seed] Take heed, take heed! the petty seed Sown in a careless hour, May run around your garden ground And smother every flow'r. [Bad thoughts come and bad thoughts go] Bad thoughts come and bad thoughts go; Are you safe as ever? No. Ware, lest they have set a mark For returning in the dark (Dangerous hour of clouded will) To rob, to kidnap, or to kill. [Heaven's space from Hell doth good from ill divide] Heaven's space from Hell doth good from ill divide; Yet in man's heart they nestle side by side. [Foul blotch of sin—disease—disgrace—] Foul blotch of sin—disease—disgrace— How ugly in another's face! In ours not seen, till conscience met Full-front, a mirror darkly clear, Shock with ourselves ourselves. Appear, O sudden truth, and sting us yet From comfort hazardous and base! [“Right and Wrong,” “Heaven and Hell,”] “Right and Wrong,” “Heaven and Hell,” These from the human spirit well; The universe doth these divide; They rest in one heart side by side, And soak all nature through and through; Each man doth his own world imbue. [The pure bright world of childhood round us lies] The pure bright world of childhood round us lies; We look thereon with weary clouded eyes. [Grieve for thy sin, grieve on; yet bless] Grieve for thy sin, grieve on; yet bless The Lord for thy unhappiness. What! would'st thou change thy nature so That sin should yield thee joy, not woe? [Sin we have explain'd away] Sin we have explain'd away; Unluckily, the sinners stay. The Game of Definitions. “Sin's but the privative of good.” Well, and hereby what's understood? Cold's but the privative of heat, Darkness the privative of light; But frost will cut away your feet, And ships and men are lost at night. Alphabetic symbols use, Or algebraic if you choose, Plus, minus; this concerns not me; Whatsoever “Sin” may be, The fierce effects we feel and see. [With this I end the day, with this begin] With this I end the day, with this begin, “O Lord Almighty, keep my soul from sin!” To M. or N. You find the word “Sin” at times in my song; But it isn't what you, friend, may choose to think wrong. [This is a pray'r for every mood—] This is a pray'r for every mood— Thy love, O Soul, be love of good. To an Angel pictured looking through the Sky. High Creature, watching twirl'd This cloudy world, See, for a seven times seven Refulgent Heaven, What belts of hope and fear Involve our sphere, Deep gloom, with fitful flash; And be not rash In blame, lest One discern Thy need to learn How man's faint orison Strives to His Throne. [Almighty Lord, if day by day] Almighty Lord, if day by day, From Thee I further move away, O let me die to-night, I pray! Yet no: this pray'r is idle breath. I understand not life or death, Nor how man's course continueth. Swept in a wide and trackless curve, Though seeming more and more to swerve, An orbit still it must preserve. I will not seek to live or die; Do as thou wilt, I'll ask not why. Keep hold of me—content am I. [Soul's Castle fell at one blast of temptation] Soul's Castle fell at one blast of temptation, But many a worm had pierced the foundation. [How argue from effects? Whate'er you do] How argue from effects? Whate'er you do, Least part of its effect comes into view. Who simply acts from conscience pure and true, Finds nothing in the consequence to rue. [Push me, urge me] Push me, urge me, Goad me, scourge me, Drag me, Lord, along thy way,— Only, leave me not, I pray! [Ruler above me! grant I may] Ruler above me! grant I may Feel right, judge right, act right, this day. [How delightful, could I sin] How delightful, could I sin And yet lose nothing—always win! How much better 'tis to see Sin is hurt and loss to me, Soul and sin do not agree. [Quibble not on Good and Evil] Quibble not on Good and Evil, “Merely relative,” as some say; Relativity is actual; It alone we know and judge by. Good and bad the outside world has, Better, worse, through all gradations; Every crime is truly nature, Every noble thought and action Nature too—but better nature. “Natural,” this alone proves nothing; Rattlesnakes and bugs are living. So the microcosm within thee May be full of reptiles, vermin, Natural, hateful, and pernicious. [A's life is such, you'd say his best hope lies] A's life is such, you'd say his best hope lies In ceasing like a bubble when he dies. B's life—from it we should untaught surmise Immortal hopes. Which probably is wise? [“Must I believe in a God?” Please yourself in the matter.] “Must I believe in a God?” Please yourself in the matter. You alone it concerns, so long as you don't make a clatter. Hearing words, were it merely in whisper, touching the Highest, (Save from reverent mouth at reverent moment) thou fliest That, my soul! As for him, of earthly nuisances chief, Who bangs away on the empty tin-can of his nobelief,— “Confound the impudent Fool!” is all that one cares to say, Unless we add “To the horsepond!” if he won't go away. [Irreverent Brute! no churchist now] Irreverent Brute! no churchist now Condemns thee, but one free as thou. At God thou shoot'st thy foolish dart, But down it drops into Man's heart. [That God is moral may be well averr'd] That God is moral may be well averr'd; But not as A or B explain the word. [Man's only true delight] Man's only true delight Flows from the infinite. [When I perceive my spirit high and clear] When I perceive my spirit high and clear In all the world remains no doubt or fear. [One friendly look, out of the vague and vast!] One friendly look, out of the vague and vast! One certain word to us, O God, at last! —How should'st thou know, poor child, the look, the word? Things understood, and not things seen or heard, Can profit. Many messages thou hast. [Ideal Truth, O Power serene] Ideal Truth, O Power serene, The soul's delight, and virgin queen! Without thee what were human life? The Nations all, in peace or strife, But ant-hills? Found in one man's breast, Lo! there in wondrous germ the best Of all that human force hath wrought, The social frame, the realms of thought, Pleasures eternal and sublime, A world above the world of time. Thou hast to mortal vision given The strength to see almost to Heaven. [The highest, widest, noblest, thought of thine] The highest, widest, noblest, thought of thine Is the most true. And is it greater than the Truth Divine? O drop of dew In which the glory of the sun doth shine! [Is “purgatory”] Is “purgatory” An idle story? Souls desire To be wash'd with fire. [I believe in GOD] I believe in GOD, The Person of Persons, Ruler of all, Just and good. Obeying His laws, GOD I trust With all my soul In life and in death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The Theologian, propping faith with lies] The Theologian, propping faith with lies; The Savant, sifting natural mysteries, Cold and irreverent; which of these is worse? And must we chose between the two, perforce? Nay, courage still! for nature and the soul Are what they are, and not in men's control. [By miracles these, and by mechanics those] By miracles these, and by mechanics those, Expound the Universe, which meantime goes Quietly on its way—how, no man knows. [Knowledge, exact and measurable, this] Knowledge, exact and measurable, this Is Science, and a precious thing, I wis; Shape cunningly its formulas, to find At will what once was found, and make each mind Heir to the general wealth. We almost seem Co-partners in the universal scheme By giving clever names (which last awhile, Till others cap them in a newer style) Whereby we may distinguish this from that, And hand-on what was given, and something more. But now, arrange a System, round and pat, A verbal microcosm: how huge a store Of words and phrases needed to bridge o'er The gaps and gulfs!—perchance to prove a snare, And let the wariest pilgrim headlong fall. Exactness, recollect: this wanting, there No Science. Scientific Friend, forbear To talk so loud: thy knowledge is but small. And were it multiplied a thousand fold, Existence glows and pulsates,—it is cold. Yea, analyse the rose's blush and breath, Jot down in algebra the starry sky, By crucible and scale test life and death; Find, be it granted, all that thou hast sought: Unless thou risest to poetic thought, Thy wisdom's folly, and thy truth a lie. Words, Words. Of knowledge we so precious hold Great part is mocking elfin-gold; Spells of similitude and phrase What mists of glamour can ye raise! Artist v. Scientist. “All the blue of the sky in your carpet-bag?—tush! Don't I carry it all on the tip of my brush? There—atoms of dust! Here—visions of glory! I mean, you don't tell us the whole of the story.” [Divide, combine, search, sift, and pry] Divide, combine, search, sift, and pry; Retort and microscope apply; Light, Sound, Electric Force, explain; The Earth, the Sun, the Blood, the Brain, All's thus and thus. But now declare Why things are right, and things are fair; What's Duty? Beauty? tell us whence Are Love, Truth, Hope, and Reverence? But stay!—hast thou this last? If not, Though thou could'st make the cold sea hot, In flying chariot Sirius reach, Full little could'st thou learn or teach. [Some have spent their money in seeking Philosopher's Stone] Some have spent their money in seeking Philosopher's Stone; Some have wasted their life in quest of Elixir Vitæ: Thou demandest the basis of morals, virtue, and faith, Searchest much for thy Soul,—beware lest in search thou consume it. [How man's high thoughts and aspirations came] How man's high thoughts and aspirations came, Guess this—guess that—still they remain the same. [God's banish'd from the Universe, they say] God's banish'd from the Universe, they say; A change of wind has blown Him quite away; Men have deposed Him. This may be—in case It was by men's consent He held His place. [You may sketch the world of what shape you please] You may sketch the world of what shape you please, But the Lord will not alter His lines for these. [“Man's tongue can utter everything:” O fool!] “Man's tongue can utter everything:” O fool! “His mind think everything:” Go back to school! A short way doth our subtlest thinking reach; Shorter, our finest artifice of speech. [The eyes of Modern Science do not grow] The eyes of Modern Science do not grow In the head, but hind-parts, and still gaze below. [What can you tell us of Life? you live in the Cavern of Death.] What can you tell us of Life? you live in the Cavern of Death. Your voice is a hollow echo; a polar wind your breath. Life, the potent, the loving, colour-flush'd, musical, gay, Tell us the secret of this from your charnel-house?—away! [Men try all fashions; “God made Man,”] Men try all fashions; “God made Man,” They now reverse, and on this plan Would scheme things out; but nothing can, Save end at last where they began. [“‘God’ is a foolish name. MAN, whom I worship, is true.] “‘God’ is a foolish name. MAN, whom I worship, is true. I see in the depths of the past MAN'S great and reverend shape; In the present and future, MAN, ever mounting to new Mathematical Pisgahs.” Why, Man was a filthy ape In the depth of the past; the present, Professor, gives us you; The future, a higher power of the like. O Heavens and Earth! To what parasitical spawn can vanity's brain give birth! A brain-louse set in a shrine and worshipt!—What should we do Were the Heavens and Earth indeed like this, but yawn and escape? [“I don't believe in either God or Man.] “I don't believe in either God or Man. Conscious Automata, we nothing can, Save as our atoms feel tyrannic chance; For all's heredity and circumstance. Conscience,—Freewill,—absurd! And if you ask How on these terms fulfil life's daily task? What motives? And what conduct?—look at me: One more respectable you'll scarcely see, As family man, friend, citizen, professor. Be you, or public judgment, my assessor.” “Good, my dear Sir!—but we must wait, I doubt, To notice how your grandchildren turn out, Born in the doctrine, reared upon the plan, Of total disbelief in God and man. Let this experiment be fairly made, Nor Science mourn, by Her high priests betray'd; Oh, let her teach them, from their tenderest youth, The Truth, the whole Truth, nothing but the Truth— Material Atoms, and Mechanic Force; And send the boys and girls rejoicing on their course!” [This World has no moral or meaning: the kaleidoscope of Man's Mind] This World has no moral or meaning: the kaleidoscope of Man's Mind, Turns it to seeming shapes,—a toy itself as we find; For there's nothing, not even ourselves, that we cannot get behind. Man is a beast, a machine; God is a dream, a name. Yet, keep your lofty ideals and trust to them, all the same: Or shoot yourself if you like: what matter is praise or blame? [“Man's a machine.” Well, if we ever can] “Man's a machine.” Well, if we ever can Construct one bit by bit on some new plan, Be sure 'twill be a Scientific Man. [Less virtuous than they might and ought to be] Less virtuous than they might and ought to be I used to think us Men. But now I see, By your light, in their share of purity Trust, patience, courage, truth, unselfishness, A wondrous and ridiculous excess. What solemn fools these tailless monkeys are Themselves of any pleasure to debar, Or suffer any pain that they can shun! Mere self-conceit when all is said and done; Choosing gold fetters, to prove choice is free! [The Age of Poetry is gone] The Age of Poetry is gone, The Age of Suicide sweeps on; Pray Heav'n it pass, tornado-wise, And leave behind it clearer skies! [How Man is like to Ape we have now heard enough and to spare] How Man is like to Ape we have now heard enough and to spare; How Man is unlike Ape is better worthy our care. All that proves us animal, let us not fear to scan; Then hopefully, heartily turn to all that makes us man. Two Gulfs. From Matter to Life a bridge to find, And then a bridge from Life to Mind: “Too hard,” says Reason. Then let us try Imagination—spread wings and fly. “This ether is too thin, alas! I flutter, I fall, I cannot pass.” [What if “Nature” be so finely wrought] What if “Nature” be so finely wrought, She is subtler than our subtlest thought, Grander than our best imagining: Is not Nature then a marvellous thing? Wherein we too have our part and lot Of a surety neither low nor small. What if something in ourselves be found Finer, larger yet than all around, And whereby alone we see it all? [Facts bear analysis and tabulation] Facts bear analysis and tabulation, And truth is found by ratiocination. Reality's our element; we make Sure way; and into our possession take New facts, acquired by conquering Intellect. All facts are precious; none should we neglect. Agreed. Nor count less precious than the rest Love, Poesy, and Conscience,—though they be Imponderable, nay, a deal too fine For chemic or for mathematic test. Into the sea of truth, the mighty sea, How far as yet goes man's best plummet-line? To a Famous Man. Magic is out of date: and yet one day You wrote five lines which have had power to slay Many (alas!) by their own desperate hands, With bullet, poison, water, knife or rope, And will slay thousands more in many lands. With false authority you took away From striving human souls all trust and hope. False—for you are no master in these things; The Genius guiding you is bare of wings. [Well, God in mind of man once held at least] Well, God in mind of man once held at least Great show of presence. If poor man's a beast, In some strange way the wretch hath noble dreams; Sage, lover, poet, hero, saint, he seems, Spells mystic meanings in the earth and skies, Lives, dreams of Heav'n, and, like an insect, dies. [“I look for God, no God can see.”] “I look for God, no God can see.” Is there a godly soul in thee? The little things of sight and sound Are by their proper senses found. Thus God is felt, not otherwise. Wouldest thou search for Him with eyes? By help of logarithms explain Him? Or draw a circle to contain Him? What kind of God were He, my friend, That you and I could comprehend. [Adventurous Spirit, trying every road] Adventurous Spirit, trying every road, You'll find you come to nothing, or to GOD. [Army of Science! ever marching] Army of Science! ever marching, All the roads of nature searching, Conquering ignorance, knowledge winning, Every end a new beginning, Fearless and unselfish fighters, Dragon-tamers, python-smiters, Deadlier minimi pursuing In their ambush out of viewing, Ev'n the subtle realm of ether Not beyond you altogether,— Stop! Behold a sacred border Which you pass not: else disorder Falls upon your troops, and madness. See to it, leaders. But, with gladness, Simple souls walk freely there And breathe on earth celestial air.</field>

[Ill folk I shun, or fight against: what can] Ill folk I shun, or fight against: what can I do with thee, thou pestilent Good Man? [The woe of the False Teacher—This] The woe of the False Teacher—This: The better he is, the worse he is; His every virtue being a prop Of the foul tyrant, Dogmatism, Foe to mankind, that soon would drop Into his native black abysm Did merely ill men hold him up. Through thee, Good Man, through thee, I say, The Devil rules the world to-day. [Shame upon those who poison youth] Shame upon those who poison youth By mixing falsehood with every truth. Shame! shame! whatever their name; And the deepest curse for the highest claim! To Certain Persons calling themselves “Christians.” What's “Primitive Christianity?” I know not: yours I feel and see, Which sets good friends and neighbours at strife, Son with parent, husband with wife; Which plays the spy upon all my life; And failing, just now, to burn men quick, Does what it can by subtler trick. When I was a boy, sincere and bold, It plied me with plotters, cunning and cold, Flung Faith into Superstition's cell, Dropp'd poison into Learning's well. When I was a lover, it haunted me With more than a rival's jealousy. When fain would I greet my brothers and sisters It comes with an oil that raises blisters Between our palms. It lifts its eyes To Heav'n, and utters calumnies, In the name of Truth it tells myriad lies, In the name of Love it hates and curses, In the name of God repeats sorcerer's verses. Now, as I love freedom, and truth, and love, And my fellows around me, and God above, So much (consider how much it must be) I abhor your Christianity. [If you believed, loud Sir, some decent part] If you believed, loud Sir, some decent part Of all you argue for with so much art, You would not more convince that black is white, But wake some interest and respect you might. [Would'st argue upon equal terms with me?] Would'st argue upon equal terms with me? Then first give up your living, or your see: Else, for good manners, must I silent be. [“An infidel!” you shout: I have, 'tis true] “An infidel!” you shout: I have, 'tis true, But very little faith, sweet Sir, in you. [Is it right, on a solemn day] Is it right, on a solemn day, To stand up in public and say “I believe, before God, this is true (If my words I may twist and screw)”? Whom do you thus hoodwink? Mainly yourself I think; But increase, too, the mighty mass Of folly and falsehood, alas! [O wretched man! who, while his soul is green] O wretched man! who, while his soul is green, Must talk of GOD, and something seem to mean; Explain at large what none has ever known, With folly half by rote and half his own; Quibble dogmatic nonsense for his bread, And pound good words until he beats them dead; In season, out of season, pray and preach; And never learn, for he must always teach. [Clergy to guide poor us are given] Clergy to guide poor us are given; We shall have need of none in Heaven. A life relieved from clergymen— O yes, we shall be happy then! [In sacred reverie and sublime delight] In sacred reverie and sublime delight My soul was rapt. One shouted in my ear “Remember God!”—alas, I see and hear A vulgar man, and all my joy takes flight. [The Wisest Living Mortal—Oh] The Wisest Living Mortal—Oh If one ten-thousandth part he knew Of what our Teachers claim to know, And gave us tidings true, From east and west and north and south How we should swarm to his gold mouth! [As rafter rafter serves to prop] As rafter rafter serves to prop, One false creed holds another up. [Every word your Oracle saith] Every word your Oracle saith, You most reverently receive it; My weak faculty of faith Can't ev'n believe that you believe it. [Assuredly, God's word is true] Assuredly, God's word is true: But, my poor brother, what are you? [Ostrichio's soul's digestion is so good] Ostrichio's soul's digestion is so good He feeds on lies and fattens on the food. Are such endow'd, of all the human race, With mental gizzards, by peculiar grace? [Peter's a madman, John agrees] Peter's a madman, John agrees, To swear the moon is mere green cheese; Next moment John will gravely tell ye The sun's all made of currant-jelly; Between the which celestial views There's not, perhaps, a pin to choose. But if it be an act of faith To say as John or Peter saith, Let's eat the sun with Jack's long spoon, Or taste a slice of Peter's moon, Provided they let quite alone This little planet of our own. [How mysteries attract!] How mysteries attract! A mystery, when known, Is but one other fact; Mystic is Truth alone. [What do your dogmas? Mix dispute and doubt] What do your dogmas? Mix dispute and doubt With every truth; make worthy folk fall out. [Great Saint, how we've misused thy fame] Great Saint, how we've misused thy fame, Sown poison where sweet footsteps trod! Alas, that thy beloved name Should live a blasphemy on GOD. To a Controversialist. In empty field your sword you flourish. Hold! Look round—the battle far away hath roll'd. [The modern plea for keeping up a Creed—] The modern plea for keeping up a Creed— “We don't believe it; no, we don't indeed!” [We don't believe it: but let it be.] We don't believe it: but let it be. It does for others, not you and me. For usual folk the usual's best: Of course, we are not like the rest. ['Twere well, in sooth] 'Twere well, in sooth, Could we sift things out; But we can't find truth, And we don't want doubt. So let old things stay, In whatever jumble; Touch them, straightway They crumble and tumble, Choke us with dust, fall on our toes. —You that come after us, deal with those! [Fain would I seek the City of Truth] Fain would I seek the City of Truth, But know not whither to turn, in sooth; Therefore, I own, it seemeth wise Still to abide in the City of Lies. I was born and have my dwelling there; Shall I turn outcast and wanderer? With staff and scrip a-searching go For a City—in Cloudland for aught I know? [I believe without bother] I believe without bother In This, That, and T'other; Whatever is current, no matter. I believe in Success, And in Comfort no less; I believe all the rest is but patter. [We hate thee, solemn Public Liar] We hate thee, solemn Public Liar, Who all men's reverence dost require. We know thine ancient mystery Hath now become a tatter'd lie, Dishonouring the Power Divine That in our Human Soul doth shine. Man's highest thought thou dost withdraw From building on true natural law His joy and worship, love and awe, Training and forcing it to fix On foolish mental juggling-tricks; Hoping a tawdry Heav'n to gain By gambling and by legerdemain. [Young Mother, with thy babe at rest] Young Mother, with thy babe at rest, Warm-pillow'd on thy happy breast, Thou leaning tenderly above With face of deep contented love, There is not elsewhere any sight On earth more bright with heavenly light; The gates of death and hell are shut, The joyful skies wide open, . . . but— But—“O Raffael of the dear Madonnas!” Painted well for sumptuous Holy Fathers! —Better, Painter, with thy Fornarina! Kisses from thy sweetheart's mouth are purer Than Saint Peter's ceremonial blessing. Child and Mother—sweet, pathetic, pious; Child and Virgin—how familiar usage Blinds to shame of natural truth dishonour'd! World of circumstance and old tradition, How it plots, with gift and threat and flattery, Men of genius, to ensnare you likewise! —“O our Raffael”—O our English Robert! [Yea, Raffael! Michael Angelo! your hands] Yea, Raffael! Michael Angelo! your hands Have help'd to build and glorify the height Whereon, far seen, that Ancient Tyrant stands, Blessing and cursing with a show of might Whereat the world still trembles. What are ye But powerful slaves that do his ill commands And help to bind souls struggling to be free? Ah, Genius, Child of Heaven, what bitter woe For all, when thou in golden chains dost go! A Dream. I saw, in dream, an aged reverend Man, Sitting upon a heap of shards and cinders; Whom when I greeted passing, “Stop!” said he, “Thou must not that way go!”—“And wherefore not?” “Because I disallow it. Stay, my son; O hear me, gentle son! Close, close thine eyes, That I may teach thy pathway. No? Then burn For ever, caitiff! who rejectest me Sitting in place of GOD!” Whereon I smiled And pass'd. He, frowning, raised his arms aloft As though to curse, but in that effort split And fell to pieces, like a lump of sand Upon the seashore in a rising tide. Then all the sea-fowl rose and scream'd, and all The fishes leap'd and gamboll'd in the surf, A shrill harsh cry, a fluttering turbulence, Subsiding instantly; and lo, I paced The broad smooth sand familiar, and the sea Roll'd calmly shoreward, murmuring round my steps With music, underneath a sky of light Purer than azure wild-flow'rs; music finer, Tenderer than song of birds or children's voices Floating in hymns of joy on morning breezes. Another Dream. A palace-temple I beheld. Through its golden gates impell'd, And measureless halls, a moving Crowd, From every land where men may live and die, Drew to the central dome. There sat the Prophet-King enthronèd high, White-robed, serene, in solemn majesty. Melodious wail of anthems, waxing loud, Burst in thundering billows of sound; Incense creeping round Involved his feet, and clomb And hung with clouds the mighty dome, Wreathing the sculptured saints and angels there; While to the people's prayerful eyes Angels and saints themselves were dimly congregated Midway the dome, and in the outside air, A throng of glorious messengers,—that waited Eager for errands to the skies, With wings of strength To mount the steep of Heav'n and find at length GOD'S own Eternal Throne. Then my dream intershifted, and became Unlike; and yet the things were still the same: A lonely Hut on a moor; A white-beard Man and poor; Wind in the crannies, whistling and sighing; Embers dying, Red in the gloom, Sending a sluggish bleary fume To eddy around the rotten thatch; And the beetles and centipedes ran about From the holes in the floor; And the rickety door Stirr'd its latch At push of savage creatures without. 'Twas near midnight. The falling flake Had turn'd the black moor deathly white. This Old Man mutter'd, half-awake, “I am supreme over every King! My talisman's greater than Solomon's Ring! All wisdom and power to me belong!” And the fire went out as he croon'd his lingering song. Ice-cold grew his feet; All his limbs lost heat; His eyes ceased to wink; His brain ceased to think; His heart ceased to beat. His jaw fell; but his forehead kept a frown. Louder the wind began to blow, And blew the Hovel down, And hid the Corpse in snow. [Dogmatic Christians, one and all] Dogmatic Christians, one and all, High-Church or Evangelical, Methodist, Independent,—fix What name upon your creed you will,— You are but rebel Catholics, The Pope's your lawful sovereign still. [All “Christian virtues” I rejoice to greet.] All “Christian virtues” I rejoice to greet. By any other name they smell as sweet. [“Art Faith's Apostle? Can'st thou save us?”—No.] “Art Faith's Apostle? Can'st thou save us?”—No. But lies proved lies had surely better go. [A pseudo-religion suits most people best] A pseudo-religion suits most people best, Claims its toll, and leaves Business and Pleasure the rest. The true thing claims merely our life, wants the whole,— Sunday, Monday,—Play, Business too,—Body and Soul. [This World is made to no man's mind] This World is made to no man's mind; Nor Next World, we perhaps shall find. [Remember this, Lover of truth and right] Remember this, Lover of truth and right, Against the Powers of Darkness sworn to fight,— If mine, a fellow-soldier's helm you smite. [“If you shake these dogmas you shake morality with them.” Yea.] “If you shake these dogmas you shake morality with them.” Yea. So never tie truth and falsehood together, from this day. [Religion—what a labyrinthine mesh!] Religion—what a labyrinthine mesh! Go back you must to GOD, and start afresh. [The New Religion will include] The New Religion will include All science, and each healthy mood, Believe in God, and work for good. [Long time amongst the thorns I dwelt] Long time amongst the thorns I dwelt; Sharp and sore the thorns I felt; Now I quit the tangled brake, Now a freer path I take. Many poor wandering souls I see Amid the maze that tortured me. Would that I carried at my belt A ringing trumpet for their sake!</field>

Friend?—Loved One?—I am ill at ease. Shall I give up my hope? declare Unmeaning promises they were That fed my youth, fine dreams of night, And lofty thoughts of clear daylight? I saw. I search and cannot find. “Come, ere too late!”—The lonely wind Brings echo, like the voice of Fate, With mutter'd dull reply “Too late!” [Fair houses in my walks I see] Fair houses in my walks I see: “How wise, pure, gentle, must they be, The unknown dwellers there!” But when some well-known house I pass, Too oft I only say “alas!” Tho' it be full as fair. [They are my friends] They are my friends Who are most mine, And I most theirs, When common cares Give room to thoughts poetic and divine, And in a psalm of love all nature blends. [We only touch by surfaces] We only touch by surfaces; But Spirit is the core of these. [One with one, not overheard] One with one, not overheard, This is converse: God being third. Fidelity. Can I be friends with that so alter'd you, And to your former friendly self keep true? [I am not shock'd by failings in my friend] I am not shock'd by failings in my friend, For human life's a zigzag to the end. But if he to a lower plane descend, Contented there,—alas, my former friend! [For thinking, one; for converse, two, no more] For thinking, one; for converse, two, no more; Three for an argument; for walking, four; For social pleasure, six; for fun, a score. [It is not you, my Foe, I fear] It is not you, my Foe, I fear, But you alas! my Friend so dear. [From the little that's shown] From the little that's shown To complete the unknown, Is a folly we hourly repeat; And for once, I would say, That men lead us astray, Ourselves we a thousand times cheat. [In argument it oft betides] In argument it oft betides The speakers might as well change sides, For aught they know or think or feel, Omitting controversial zeal. [Is it true] Is it true That any two, Whatever they seem, whatever they do, Are strangers still? I like it ill, Yet half believe against my will. [Solitude is very sad] Solitude is very sad, Too much company twice as bad. [Little care I for the faults of the small] Little care I for the faults of the small, His own mere undoing: Great Man, thy greatness belongs to us all, Thy faults are our ruin. [Limited each is: but—O dear!] Limited each is: but—O dear! To find one's Great Men insincere; No disappointment so severe. [O great one! O mighty one!—] O great one! O mighty one!— Yet you fall short. All the better!—Man's greater. You are but one sort. [Unless you are growing wise and good] Unless you are growing wise and good, I can't respect you for growing old; 'Tis a path you fain would avoid if you could, And it means growing ugly, suspicious, and cold. [His way of life was zig-zag still] His way of life was zig-zag still; Yet ever creeping up the hill. [Well for the man whom sickness makes more tender] Well for the man whom sickness makes more tender, Who doth his prideful cravings then surrender, Owning the boon of every little pleasure, And love (too oft misprized) a heavenly treasure, Finding at last a subtle strength in weakness, A medicine for the soul in body-sickness.

[Some win our gratitude merely by living] Some win our gratitude merely by living; Others can't get it by all their giving. [A hope that we are taught to prize] A hope that we are taught to prize Is, meeting Kindred in the skies; But many would as soon, I doubt, Meet their old ulcer, cough, or gout. [“Old Friend?”—For many years, I wis] “Old Friend?”—For many years, I wis, I've known how great a bore he is. [While friends we were, the hot debates] While friends we were, the hot debates That rose 'twixt you and me! Now we are mere associates, And never disagree. [If he draw you aside from your proper end] If he draw you aside from your proper end, No enemy like a bosom friend. [Dear Friend, so much admired, so oft desired] Dear Friend, so much admired, so oft desired, 'Tis true that now I wish to be away. You are not tiresome, no! but I am tired. Allow to servant brain and nerves full play In their electric function, yea and nay; Faith and affection do not shift their ground, Howe'er the vital currents ebb and flow; To feel most free because most firmly bound Is Friendship's privilege: so now I go To rest awhile the mystic nerves and brain, To walk apart,—and long for you again.

[The expectancy of joy] The expectancy of joy In the fancy of a Boy, Even thou could'st not fulfil it, O Helena of Troy! [Ev'n in thy arms, O Fair!] Ev'n in thy arms, O Fair!

[Tho' bright with youthful bloom and grace] Tho' bright with youthful bloom and grace, Eternal beauty hath no place In this so much admirèd face. True Beauty is the flow'r and sign Of something inward far more fine; Its source mysterious and divine. [Mary would have loved me well] Mary would have loved me well Could I but have let her; Mary's gone, and, sooth to tell, Sorely I regret her. Were she here—much I fear We should do no better. [O girl of comely form and face] O girl of comely form and face, Were half the sweetness and the grace Within thy soul, how precious thou! Mere lovely cloud or blossom now. Ungrateful! when such dear delight Flows to me from her very sight. And can I see her soul aright? God's index we must never slight. Yet, stay: how much is drawn from race? How much to culture should we trace? How much is bloom of health and youth? How much her own, in deepest truth? And what do all these questions prove? This plainly—you are not in love With Fiordilisa; else, I swear, You'd find her past expression fair; And how or why, would nothing care. [I laugh'd in Pleasure's face] I laugh'd in Pleasure's face, “Your wiles I clearly trace;” She frowning said, “I trow, 'Tis time for you to go, This world's for you no place.” “Nay, nay, still grant me grace,” Said I, “and let us hold As friends if not as lovers (For love no flaw discovers), Not lovers as of old.” Since then, I fear, she's cold, And turns away her face. [“I will have none but a Queen] “I will have none but a Queen; A Queen will never have me; And, therefore, alack and well-a-day! Alone must I be.” “Let only thy true right sweetheart, By favour of Heaven be seen, And if thou ownest a loyal heart Thou hast found thy Queen.” [Whenever I see from my loneliness] Whenever I see from my loneliness Two to each other kindly press, I envy not, but in grateful mood Rejoice that earth holds thus much good.

[Women, in and out of season] Women, in and out of season, Act on great men's public lives: Truly now, the Turks have reason In their management of wives! [Men's wives' opinions, what are they to us?] Men's wives' opinions, what are they to us? Much. M. to please his wife writes thus and thus; And books like M.'s are our Leviticus. N., too, to please his wife is shy or bold; And N. a lever of the world doth hold, Sways Fortune's mighty wheel as it is roll'd. [A woman's prime is nearly done] A woman's prime is nearly done Before a man's is well begun, [If all might choose their sex, there would not then] If all might choose their sex, there would not then Be left one woman to a hundred men.

      <field name="fulltext">A QUESTION. England is proud. And France was proud; yet gave Her honour to the keeping of a knave, Sham Frenchman, sham Napoleon: huge the fault, And harsh the penalty. If we exalt A master-trickster to our chiefest place, Sham Christian and sham Englishman,—is this, When the world rocks, no chance for Nemesis To hurl us into misery and disgrace? We are no cowards,—“Nought shall make us rue, If England to herself do prove but true”— But think, speak, England! Dost thou, heart and soul, Trust this man? and give him thy fate's control? Nov. 1877. Too Practical to be thought of. Let Pasha-rule perish sans pity; Make Constantinople Free-City; All Europe supply a police For preserving the federal peace; There—and elsewhere, why not? Is this fighting The sensible way of wrong-righting? Else, what are these huge armies for? Are most people thirsty for war? Ah! Police might we have, and not “Policy,” And of Statecraft the damnable folly see. Patriotism. Protean Selfishness puts on no guise More apt than “Patriotism” to blind our eyes: Shall Briton, Frenchman, Russ, American, Glory in things that would disgrace a Man? Set your own Country foremost; work for her; Hers to all private interests prefer: But never dream that violence and fraud In her name turn to praise and nobleness; That lies are bad at home but good abroad; That honour and fair dealing have a bound Mark'd on the map; that any right can prove Wrong to another, or make his right less. And after all this, recollect—there's Love. Nay, Love comes first of all. But, look around! In Snow. O english mother, in the ruddy glow Hugging your baby closer when outside You see the silent, soft, and cruel snow Falling again, and think what ills betide Unshelter'd creatures,—your sad thoughts may go Where War and Winter now, two spectre-wolves, Hunt in the freezing vapour that involves Those Asian peaks of ice and gulfs below. Does this young Soldier heed the snow that fills His mouth and open eyes? or mind, in truth, To-night, his mother's parting syllables? Ha! is't a red coat?—Merely blood. Keep ruth For others; this is but an Afghan youth Shot by the stranger on his native hills. 1878. [With pseudo-monarchy and creed] With pseudo-monarchy and creed, How can a Nation still succeed?— By giving these but little heed. It tries to steer by common-sense, While keeping up a huge pretence Of loyalty and reverence. It sweeps the road-ways of the state: But Lies o'erhead accumulate,— At last an avalanche of fate. Words and Deeds. The soldier's boast—to meet, unmoved, Death's eye. Allow that Zulu men know how to die, Fighting against the spoiler in their land; The savage virtue which they highest hold They practise well; no lions half so bold. But other virtues, too, we understand, Being Englishmen and Christians; counting good Justice, Unselfishness, and Brotherhood,— Nay, best. We know the way to talk of things. O God! are we the cruellest of hordes, With deadliest weapons and with falsest words Of any race the quiet moon enrings? 1879. [England! leave Asia, Africa, alone] England! leave Asia, Africa, alone, And mind this little country of thine own. [To do such dreadful work, not merely coin] To do such dreadful work, not merely coin We bribe them with, but monstrous flattery join, Make Honour and Glory their especial meed Whose trade is bloodshed; as if they indeed Were patriots, heroes, manhood's flower, and not At best the venal substitutes for those, At worst the savage unremorseful foes Of justice, pity, love, all in man's lot That's more than bestial,—ready at the click Of alien will which has the word or trick To set this order'd violence astir, This myriad hangman, or else murderer. O there are victories, the which to name Calls into brave men's cheeks the blush of shame. [Heroic Chili! Brave Peru!] Heroic Chili! Brave Peru! The glorious deeds of arms ye do By some new Homer should be sung. What quarrel doth this rage inspire? They settle thus by blood and fire Which shall sell most of seagull's dung. 1880. [Have Nations human consciences? If so] Have Nations human consciences? If so What sinners!—demons, if you answer no. To a Primrose. Simple rustic Flow'r, in thee Emblem of our BEN we see; Had'st thou not before been known By his tomb thou must have grown, And some new Ovid sung of this Lovely metamorphosis; Fragrant wilding, artless blossom, Fit for every Tory bosom! [The English Nation is my vexation] The English Nation is my vexation, The French is twice as bad, Germany she bothers me, And America drives me mad! [A poet sits at ease] A poet sits at ease Before his study-fire; Gently warms his knees, And heaps the fuel higher. Without, the storm-wind blows; Within, how calm it is! Books stand round in rows; Few more famed than his. The Poet fills his glass And lights a fresh cigar; In words more firm than brass He sings the praise of War. Blood he would not spill, Stroke deal, save with pen; He to-night shall kill Fifty thousand men; Villages and towns Burn in his study fire; Tune to women's groans And children's shrieks, his lyre. Mild the Poet's eyes; Murderous his song; Supporting ancient lies, Confusing right and wrong. German he, or French, Or English, matters not,— Would his cheek might blench Ere the page he blot; From beyond the stars Hearing “He whose breath Blows the flame of wars, Merits bloody death!” Mother Shipton. When John's great elephant is sold, When London streets have grass for gold, When spades go up and swords go down, When hats are worn without a crown, When crowds are fed without a feast, When pray'rs are said without a priest, When ringdoves laugh and foxes weep, Then shall poor men sow and reap.</field>

[Other men, we think] Other men, we think, Of life's dear pleasures drink, Unmix'd with drops of care; While chiefly sours Are ours, And thoughts disconsolate. But even as they seem To us, of us they deem; Their happy times are rare, And tangled still With ill; For such is human fate. [How short is the life of a man!] How short is the life of a man! How often that life is too long! He won't do the little he can; The little he does is done wrong. [New things happen every day] New things happen every day, Or old things happen some new way; Old things happen over and over, Still for new people to discover; New-old things on the same life-road, New folk treading where old have trod, Where each can only see what he can, A stone is a stone, and a man is a man. —But what is a Man? O tell me this, And give me your shoe, my king, to kiss! Suppose it means no more, after all, Than leaves that sprout and leaves that fall? Suppose, now, “Soul” should really be The nursling of this Infinity? [Man's life is not too happy at the best] Man's life is not too happy at the best; How artfully he doth himself molest! Refusing many good things close at hand, Hurting himself with ills himself hath plann'd. [The cruellest of animals is Man] The cruellest of animals is Man, By his own doing, not by nature's plan. [If too presumptuous 'twere to pray] If too presumptuous 'twere to pray For happy hours, yet this we may— Grant us to know, Ye Mystic Powers! Our happy hours Before they go.

[How grave (the child thinks) deep and wise] How grave (the child thinks) deep and wise, Reproving folly, are men's eyes!— Not guessing with what pompous airs We go about our mean affairs. [Just at the age when a man is clearest and firmest in mind] Just at the age when a man is clearest and firmest in mind, In a network of foolish circumstance too often he sits entwined. [O were I but rid of these ties] O were I but rid of these ties Adieu to vexation and sorrow! O were I but rid of these ties— To go knotting up new ones to-morrow! [What hinders me, you ask, to do my best?] What hinders me, you ask, to do my best? Why, all the world,—and you among the rest. [Clever Youth of acquisitive turn] Clever Youth of acquisitive turn, From an idle poet deign to learn; If you want to be rich and praised in your day, What fits the time you must do and say, And carefully shun to say or do What you deepliest know to be right and true. [The Spirit said “Be on my side] The Spirit said “Be on my side, O rare Man!” How hath he replied? The poet sings a perjured song; Comfort has bribed him to the wrong; The preacher leaves a truth unsaid Would rob his house of daily bread; The satirist bows among the rest Before the target of his jest. The stolid sensual world controls And subjugates the choicest souls. Dead Salt. Poor Age! if even thy greatest are not true To thee or to themselves, what canst thou do? [I cannot see, but still I can conceive] I cannot see, but still I can conceive An Honest Man,—which doth some comfort give. [O the swarm of trifles] O the swarm of trifles That teases and rifles! You're match'd against fate When the combat is great, Against demons you fight, Not with bugs pass your night; But the swarm of trifles It worries, it stifles!

[French-polishing manners your trade is] French-polishing manners your trade is, You smile at my clumsy short-coming; You're very polite to the ladies,— But are you respectful to women? [Democracy may] Democracy may Smooth manners spoil; Yet we, who pay Such a sum for oil, Have we much to boast of, pray? [Mean is the man (so John Bull thinks)] Mean is the man (so John Bull thinks) Who cringes, crouches, blinks, and slinks, Nay, uses mere civility, Unless he profit well thereby. [Old England is the only place] Old England is the only place Where rudeness counts as no disgrace; Bold Britons courtesy disdain, Unless they have some end to gain; A title though, no matter what, Can jerk the British hand to hat; And British voices loud huzzay Newspaper heroes of the day. But would you know what truly thrills Our soul with awe, with wonder fills? Observe that plain and common man, Like you or me; gaze while you can. “Why so?” A solemn whisper sounds,— “He's worth two hundred thousand pounds!” [Not men and women in an Irish street] Not men and women in an Irish street, But Catholics and Protestants you meet.

[Intolerance may be, no doubt] Intolerance may be, no doubt, Virtue; but Virtue wrong side out. [So tangled are we, take any man] So tangled are we, take any man, Choose how to think of him—so you can. You are justly precious in this one's sight; That one despises you, and he's right.

Away with all “crats!” we won't be cratted; And as for Public Opinion—drat it! [Would you treat all you meet as brothers and sisters?] Would you treat all you meet as brothers and sisters? Nay, nay, hold away! much touch raises blisters. Keep place, leave space, beware of too-near; To each orb, each unit, its atmosphere. [You'll hear a Tiger growl] You'll hear a Tiger growl, But you can't beware of a Fool, You'll hear a Serpent hiss; A Fool is worse than this. A Fool when you espy, With trembling hasten by. A Fool within your house Is deadly dangerous. A Fool, though good and civil, Is darkness and the devil! [With women and men of all natures and stations] With women and men of all natures and stations I fain would have lived in noble relations; But baffled in this, and attraction still strong, Ignoble alliances oft drew me wrong. Yet, Allah be praised! howe'er I might roam, I return'd to the Best, there only at home.

Wilkins's opinions? No! not even these, But what he thought would vex Timms, or Toodles please.

Success is an art, and the public's an ass. [Ninny is nuisance enough; Dolt worse; but worst is the Blackguard.] Ninny is nuisance enough; Dolt worse; but worst is the Blackguard. I was attack'd by all three, quietly going my ways, Humming a tune to myself, plotting and dreading no evil. “Pooh!” I said to the first; nothing at all to the next; Third got a taste of my cudgel, and, leaving him rubbing his shoulders, Off walk'd I, rather vext: “Why are such creatures at large?” Were I to name in my verse the three obscure little wretches, Memory of man might yield some little nook of contempt.

[Could famous authors' Ghosts get at their books] Could famous authors' Ghosts get at their books, How much they would rub out!—or try to—zooks! To a Writer. Show me just thy real thought, Tell me how it is with thee; Count not up the value brought; What the value is to me Thou that bringest may'st not see. Strain not manner and selection To impossible perfection; Let the work be frankly wrought. But its faults must be thine own, Not the twist of sloven tools, Not of skin, but bred in bone, Folly undevised of fools, Ignorance not learnt in schools. No great task—an easy giving! Just a book that's warm and living, Not mere painted mist or stone.

Writing. A man who keeps a diary, pays Due toll to many tedious days; But life becomes eventful—then His busy hand forgets the pen. Most books, indeed, are records less Of fulness than of emptiness. Prim. Of Grammar and of Science every rule Knows Prim, and is in short a finish'd fool. Book and Author. Here is a message of important look, As though the Heavens by special angel sent it; But when you've question'd—How much means the Book? Enquire (alas!)—How much the Author meant it. PLUS ULTRA. “Count no man happy ere his death.” And then May come the foolish biographic pen. On a Certain Scientific Writer.

Two Shades, not children of that May moonlight, In the great Abbey Cloisters walk'd one night; The land they came from was far off, yet near; Their talking no one but themselves could hear. The Show of Printing brought them for a day To London, but they long'd to be away. G. C. “See, Caxton, how thy name is glorified In England, and throughout the world wide! Thy little press i' th' Amry was indeed Like to that little grain of mustard seed, And now hath grown into a mighty tree Beyond all else for leafy dignity, Nay into many trees, which fill the land, Laden with fruit of knowledge for the hand Of every man to gather at his ease.” W. C. “Dear Poet! little joy have I in these Mountains of inky paper, that would climb Half-way to yonder moon in course of time Were printed leaves indeed immortal things, Not trivialler, the most, than May-flies' wings, And scarce more durable. Thy learnèd clerk Had twenty books, which he did read and mark And get great good of. O for scribes once more! If men thereby in poetry and lore Might, unconfusèd, study of the best, Think privately their own thoughts for the rest, And do their work, and, after, take their mirth. This Printing-Press, meseems, doth cumber earth; Souls turn'd to words, and words to merchandize. The good books were not written in such wise.” G. C. “Nay, William, we two may no longer swink, And the world rolls, whatever we may think. How changed is London! merely this one place To greet us with an old familiar face. A noisy smoky scrambling world! 'twere woe To bide much longer here. Then let us go. I thank thee for my Tales, be how things may. They're children of the earth, and let them stay.” The two Shades melted slow; the moon went down; Dawn crept unheeded o'er the monstrous Town.</field>

How real!—and such is Poetry; Where, through harmony of words Murmurs harmony of things.

[Many for Poems care much, for Poesie little or nothing] Many for Poems care much, for Poesie little or nothing; Story, character, reasoning, subtlety, eloquence, wit, They find; the verse at most is merely taken as clothing And decoration,—'tis well if they be not “bored” with it; But the fine, the mystical, magical influence, all-involving, Lifting, dissolving, reshaping, into music revolving, Giving a life to the words, putting an atmosphere round them, Of this no sense have they, and Poesie leaves where it found them.

You're a true Poet: but, my dear, If you would hold the public ear, Remember to be not too clear. Be strange, be verbally intense; Words matter ten times more than sense; In clear streams, under sunny skies, The fish you angle for won't rise; In turbid water, cloudy weather, They'll rush to you by shoals together. “Ignotum pro magnifico;” The least part of your meaning show; Your readers must not understand Too well; the mist-wrapt hill looks grand, The placid noonday mountain small. Speak plainly, folk say—“Is that all?” Speak riddles—“What is here?”—They read And re-read, many times indeed; “How fine! how strange! how deep! how new! Here's my opinion; what say you? It may be this; it might be that; Who can be certain what he's at This necromancer?” While they talk, You swing your solemn cloak and stalk; Or else look on with smile urbane, “Well done, my children,—guess again!” Oh, let me not advise in vain, Be what you will, but don't be plain! Self-Criticism. J. R. saith S. T. C. is but a muff. At writing verse. J. R. hath said enough. A Public Monument. No human being since my life began Have I disparaged wilfully; but Man Collective hath his rights; and those who claim To build for ever, in the nation's name, A shrine for hero-worship, seek to do No light thing, lightly as it may be done. So let a voice declare, if only one, What, doubtless, many silent hearts hold true. Who lift Lord Byron to a worshipt place, Thereby, as far as in their power, disgrace Our Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and the rest Whose writings are what England hath of best For wisdom, healthy joy, and love, and faith. “Go to! thou priggish fool,” the critic saith, “This man could blow his trumpet with such force That all fame's echoes answer'd. Grant it coarse, That music. Grant him vicious, insolent, Untruthful, shallow, vain; self-discontent His highest moral reach; yet”— Hold you there! Grant also his reverberated blare Louder than fifty Alpine thunder-storms; His fame the Muses' holy hill deforms, Whereto, while passing impulse had the sway, He forced his careless arbitrary way. Muses, Heav'n keep your State republican! Your one lord is your one vulgarian. [Apollo smiles on bards of every sort] Apollo smiles on bards of every sort, Save sneerers; they're unwelcome at his court. Inscription omitted on a Public Monument. Look, and receive admonishment from me: Such as I was, take good care not to be! Statua Infelix. “Erected by B. D., and carved by lord knows who, If I look doubly sulky, no wonder that I do, This endless penal servitude condemn'd to undergo, In Wellington's back garden to sit watching Rotten Row.” To a Modern Poet. “Songs of despair, O Poet, only songs of despair? True, we have trouble enough, fear and sorrow and care. And this is the courage, the help, the consolation thou'rt bringing,— All that's evil in life and man persistently singing? Love, joy, wisdom, and goodness, are shams, by you detected; Beauty's a poisonous growth, root, fruit, and flow'r infected, Passing fair and sweet, a savour of death unto Death; Life being a painted bubble, the chance of an idle breath. If Will there be, 'tis a Cacodæmon's, half-mocking, half-loathing, Who plays with his puppets, tortures them, touches them into nothing! Songs such as these, O brother, how will they help us along? We have a journey to make, would fain be cheerful and strong; The deepest thing we know is that right does differ from wrong. Evils there are in the world. Shall we add to them evil song? Turn to the Devil at once, and worship him, body and soul?— By your leave, that looks not to me the wisest plan on the whole.” Modern Poet answers “But supposing I, the Poet, . . .

Gay poison-toadstools on the rotting stem, Prismatic bubbles on the putrid pond,— Such Books this age produces: far beyond All flow'rs, the critics tell us,—trust to them!

This also through the gates of ear and eye Reveals itself in beauty, so intense That the glad Spirit, using modes of sense, Brings forth our angel-mortal, Poesie. Form satisfies, establishing the past. Colour enlivens, makes the present keen. Music breeds longings, wooing bodiless. By habitude of Language, things are seen, And Music's cousin can to ear express The musical of Life, orb'd in sweet Verse at last.

[That base curmudgeon who in Nelson's stead] That base curmudgeon who in Nelson's stead Was made an earl (the one true Nelson dead), And flung poor generous Emma to the dogs, Would sooner when his hour approach'd, I'll swear, Have chosen Erebus's fiery bogs Than Heav'n, if sure to meet Horatio there. [Berries, and also seeds] Berries, and also seeds, Out of moments and moods they have sprung. Pearls, or only glass beads, On a thread of life they are strung.

[The figures of Heroes by history outlined] The figures of Heroes by history outlined Can only take colour and life from your mind. [He who worships Success] He who worships Success Follows no blind guide: “I merely can grope and guess; Let the Universe decide.” Only, to learn aright Who does or does not succeed, He must keep true ends in sight,— A difficult matter indeed! [Honour and Fortune never sought thee out] Honour and Fortune never sought thee out; 'Tis not their way; And had'st thou left thy home in search of these, Thy shady nook, and miss'd them, thou no doubt Would'st rue it dearly: nay, If thou had'st found them. Is thy mind at ease? Thy little house wholesome and seemly? Rest Contented there, and welcome as a guest Each coming Day. [Each thinks himself exceptional] Each thinks himself exceptional: Ridiculous!—and yet sublime. The individual may be small, Yet individuality's the prime Glory and hope of us poor Sons of Time. [The imperial essence, the transcendent dower] The imperial essence, the transcendent dower Of all good moments, is the Sense of Power; The joy of all enjoyments, high or mean, Active or passive, stormy or serene. The Sense of Power is freedom, warmth, and light; The Sense of Weakness, gloom and chains and blight; The Sense of Power is life's immortal breath; The Sense of Weakness is the touch of death.

Dump's grand stupidity is such, No genius could surprise so much; What it may think or say or do Guess not: 'tis boundless, ever new! Squirmley. If I could hate thee, Squirmley, thus I'd curse— “Remain thyself!”—I could not wish thee worse. Mellita. She praises every one, So sweetly!—but, when done, They who praise all, praise none. A Distinguished Man. James has a kind of half or third-part face, And even thus much as it were by grace; He should, with such a character as his, Be scarce more featured than a wig-block is. Now, he's distinguish'd; for no sheep-dog knows One bleater, as the woolly torrent flows, More surely than the loving wife of James Amongst the crowd of men her husband claims. [I loved A. B. yet my praise was cool.] I loved A. B. yet my praise was cool. I flatter'd X. Y. and thought him a fool. Promptus. Trifles, but done with such easy ability: What he must have in reserve! . . . If you knew,— That's his particular merit, facility; Grant a millennium, there's all he could do. Long Shadow. A man three hundred miles away Threw shade across the sunny day; His loveless looks, his cold replies, Darken'd the ground and dimm'd the skies. Dictatorius. “What! happy in your own way, fool, And never went to me to school! Yourself, not me, you may deceive so; Happy you're not, tho' you believe so.” Veterator. You know him a rogue, and you keep him your friend; Shall we pity you when you are bit in the end? Profit and Loss. John makes ten pound a day: but John, ifakes! Loses a day for each ten pound he makes. Dorr. Dorr through his life has been content to wait In lazy hopes of doing something great; In practice null, in theory surprising, Dorr sleeps till noon to dream of early rising. Corpulentus. Hope not to dominate by bulk, Tho' tall of stature, huge of hulk! I've known a portlier man than you,— The biggest fool I ever knew. Jactator. Don't look so bold and talk so loud, my friend! You're not so much alive as you pretend. Dives. Charitable do you say, Dives is?—content to pay Three per cent. for commutation Of love in life and conversation. Flibb. “Life is a jest,”—Flibb finds this true. His is a mighty dull one too.

Of early rising George great boast doth make; But, all day through, George is but half awake. Donans. Yes, you give gifts, yourself you never give; So thanks, but never gratitude, receive. Tumidus. His body, voice, and gesture are so strong, You think his will is also; but you're wrong. Self-will he has; but then the Self is weak, And knows not where to go, or what to seek. Frank Rascal. “I have some right to scorn the world indeed, Where men like me (I know myself) succeed: Why should I spare it?—Yours be virtue's meed! Come to me for a dinner if you need.” Jay. Jay, having done a vile thing, goes away And boasts of it; whereafter, people say “Ah, his own tale—and what a liar is Jay!” Yes, we may reckon him a liar indeed Who can make truth a first-rate lie at need, And by being known as liar doth so succeed. Grunch. Grunch, being sold to the Devil, Would fain think everything evil, Make lord and master of all The Demon that holds him in thrall. Brisk. Brisk's a very industrious man, it is true; But most that he does, 'twere well not to do. Click. Click's brain is small, but hung Close at the back of his tongue; His best without waiting you hear; No better, and give him a year. Tompkins. Billy Tompkins is a fool; Billy Tompkins looking cool, Pray how should this be anything to me? Yet in Tompkins looking cool, Though I know he is a fool, I am ready something ominous to see. Crœsulus. Keep what you've got. But hark'ee, wealthy sir! Be proud in secret; make but little stir. Your overshare should fill your heart with shame. Let toleration be your utmost claim. On a Tradesman. A gentlemanly tradesman this; To deal with such a man is bliss. Him as a gentleman you treat Of course,—you have no other mind; But he reserves in full, you'll find The tradesman's privilege to cheat; Then scold, reprove him if you can,— He's such a gentlemanly man! Methinks a better time we had With commonplace obsequious cad. [“Adulteration is a form of Competition”] “Adulteration is a form of Competition” Saith a British Manufacturer and Statesman; Shall we write upon his monument the sentence?

You nothing produce, You never lay eggs. O, you're a transmitter. If A has an egg intended for me, He hands it to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to me—who pay, after A, B, C, D, and E, for stopping the way; For surely 'twere fitter A's egg and my penny Changed hands without paying a toll to so many, Which terribly docks Farmer A of his gain, While of eggs far from fresh I often complain. Brown and Green. Mr. Brown, Mr. Green, are precisely an age; By the register so we are priggishly told. One noteworthy fact it omits from its page,— Brown never was young; Green will never be old. To my Friend Edward. To say “All . . . are rogues,” dear Ned, Were rash; and so I leave the words unsaid. To my Friend Matthew.

[In every trouble, say—] In every trouble, say— “This too will pass away.” [How is it that Man's mere phantasy] How is it that Man's mere phantasy Finer than any truth can be? [How easily go things astray!] How easily go things astray! “Some impish mischief works” we say, “Is life's law in a tangle?”—nay; 'Tis we who do not law obey. [In the midst of labour and folly and strife] In the midst of labour and folly and strife, Is somehow hidden the life of Life. [“All away?”] “All away?” Nay, nay! Something's real, and that doth stay. Positive truth. Suppose each mortal comes to nought: Your total of Humanity, By calculation fairly wrought, A countless row of noughts will be. [Be not impatient, O Soul] Be not impatient, O Soul; Thou movest on to thy goal. Be not full of care; In the Universe thou hast thy share. Be not afraid, but trust; Thou wilt suffer nothing unjust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Here must I stay awhile, against my will] Here must I stay awhile, against my will, And long to flee to lonely Bramble Hill. What countless crowds these grimy streets do fill! How cheap is man!—and woman cheaper still [“Nation of Shopkeepers”—how base a name!] “Nation of Shopkeepers”—how base a name! “Of cheating Shopkeepers” were still worse fame. [A whore that's gentle, mild, and sweet] A whore that's gentle, mild, and sweet, Dainty, modest-worded, neat, She's a creature just so far Worse than filthy trollops are, As of womanhood the more She puts into this trade of whore. [Soldiers have fame, and harlots infamy] Soldiers have fame, and harlots infamy; Birds of a feather, for all that, they be, And gladly flock together, as you see. [Hireling Soldier, Priest, and Woman] Hireling Soldier, Priest, and Woman, Not uncommon, yet inhuman. [Many things flash across the town-bred mind] Many things flash across the town-bred mind, They come and go and leave small trace behind. Few things, oft trudging through the rustic brain, Impress themselves in marks that long remain. Country makes much of trifles; Town makes light Of life's chief things. How hard to judge aright! [The Workers' Revolution must begin] The Workers' Revolution must begin (Else that were also vanity) within; Grant honest life and honest work its aim. Or do they merely envy whom they blame? [Old folk, tho' weak, will serve you best: of late] Old folk, tho' weak, will serve you best: of late Conscience in work is quite gone out of date. [Is idleness indeed so black a crime?] Is idleness indeed so black a crime? What are the Busy doing, half their time? [O the buzz and clack and clatter] O the buzz and clack and clatter, Mighty noise and little matter! [The Century gallops, glorying itself] The Century gallops, glorying itself On swiftness, downhill, to an unknown gulf. [In the Great City, as 'twere Hell] In the Great City, as 'twere Hell, People who know each other well Rub elbows and go blankly by With a pretended stranger's eye;— Yet this is better than the grin Where all is cold and dark within; Better than the wink or glance Of the comrogue's countenance. [One Cockney you despise; four million such] One Cockney you despise; four million such You brag of; why? London a larger smutch On England, is it truly more a town? Thames more a river when its borders drown? Uses and graces of a town are hid And lost the dingy labyrinth amid. [A bat-wing'd Cupid takes his flight] A bat-wing'd Cupid takes his flight Through the city streets by night; Dread him, shun him, Boys and Girls! He has horns among his curls, He has venom on his arrow, Rotting skin and bone and marrow. The Hogarthian or rather Goyan drawing attached to this cannot at present be reproduced; it might do much good. [Stir and change from morn till night] Stir and change from morn till night, Wealth of culture and delight, Pictures, music, libraries, Theatres, the flower of these, Every topic its oration, Every mood its conversation, Clever men and lovely women, Tides of human life to swim in,— O the marvels of the town! Can I swim? or shall I drown? Heavenly bright the water-gleam, Cold and muddy proves the stream. Endless talk—but what is it? Insight, poetry, wisdom, wit? Or news and gossip, lies and sneers, Limber tongues and itching ears? Books,—too many; which impede, Distract; and where's the time to read? Music,—in the glare and throng Its tender dream-world suffers wrong. Pictures,—thousands! large and small, Jumbled over miles of wall, Colour, subject, scale, and focus Jumping as by hocus-pocus. Theatres,—ay, more than plenty, I have been to nearly twenty, Now, one good well-acted play Show me, Civis, to repay All this costly crush and bother, Filth and clatter, smoke and smother. Rather, friend, O show me where In blessed silence and pure air, I may bury fathoms deep In the fountain of sweet sleep My wearied senses, wilder'd mind. No such place in Town I find.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Here we've wander'd some few hours] Here we've wander'd some few hours, Plagued with flies, and pleased with flowers; Children dear, the sun is low, The bell is tolling: let us go. [The metal sleeps in its hidden vein] The metal sleeps in its hidden vein, The blue-eyed flax waves over the plain, The silk-worm spins on the mulberry leaf; The Days are spinning their joy and grief. Threads are a-twining, manifold, Of flax, hemp, cotton, and silk, and gold; For joyous Beauty, for Soldier proud, For work-dress, cable, halter, and shroud. From fields of sense, and mines of thought, Threads of life are twisted and wrought: We are weaving Character, weaving Fate, And Human History, little and great. [We count men subject to mortality] We count men subject to mortality; Yet take one man—we could not let him die. [If I must die when all is said and done] If I must die when all is said and done, I am dead now; true life has ne'er begun. [If we saw these things clear, what then?] If we saw these things clear, what then? This were not Earth, and we not Men. [A skeleton typifies Death.] A skeleton typifies Death. Let be: 'tis enough exact. Death, the bones of a fact, Wanting the blood and breath. [What! am I too grown old? How days have hasted!] What! am I too grown old? How days have hasted! Soon I must leave this world, nor loth to go. Novelty, Hope, Defeat, Success, I've tasted, Each various flavour of Life's joy and woe. Great things I can surmise, but nothing know. I've lived a man with men, and with the rest Move on to die in turn, and say “So best.” [A mystic tracery of Stars] A mystic tracery of Stars Hung in the midnight sky, Wherein methought In one great word was wrote, Could I but read it, Human Destiny. But Destiny debars. [All things freely flow] All things freely flow In the starry current: Sullen or abhorrent, As half-drown'd we glide; Know too much, too little; Turn our strength and gladness Into gloom and madness, Struggling with the tide. Multitudes of germs Travel unconfounded; Planets simply rounded Make gigantic way; Terms of fate protect them, Ignorant of treason:— Well when human reason Chooses to obey. Fatal flowing Time, Strong thy liquid fetter; Yet I swim the better, Nor compassion crave: Prime of thee and all things, Nature's secret essence Lives to its own presence Where we break thy wave. [O young Man! cast off cowardice] O young Man! cast off cowardice And sloth and selfishness; arise, Wash with clear dew thy drowsy eyes, Run on the joyful hills of morn, Let dull dreams fly the breeze's horn, And golden rays make fresh thy blood! To Age the dubitating mood; In youth audacity is wise. [I hear the hum of earth, alive and merry] I hear the hum of earth, alive and merry I hear the dashing of the restless wave; I hear a slow bell ringing where they bury; I hear a small bird singing by a grave; I hear the steady tramp of Time; I hear My own blood pulsing in my pillow'd ear. I hear no sound at all, afar or near. I hear a river of enchantment flowing Out of the stars, and round the dim world going.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">[Now, little Book, go thy ways!] Now, little Book, go thy ways! Move, if thy legs will carry thee! Pleasure nor profit nor praise To me—trudge off, nor tarry thee! Why with so cruel a blast Thus blow thee forth?—To get quit of thee! Clear the old desk at last, And the mind, of every bit of thee. Go, with a blessing!—go hang!— Which shall I say?—leave both out? Yet must I think with a pang Of the world where I'm sending you, loth, out. 'Midst the cold shoulders to roam, With a curse here and there, or a flout, cast;— Neither abroad nor at home Art thou wanted, pitiful Outcast! Poor little Wandering Jew, Pilgrim it! will-you, nill-you; Welcomed of none or few; Yet neither can any man kill you. Go! for fate's voice is heard; No longer with me sojourner. Heaven send a kindly word Whiles, and a chimney-corner!</field>
