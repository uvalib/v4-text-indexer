FIRUMBRAS. “God For Hys grace sschylde vs from schame!” her basnettys and her helmys they lacydyn well: And her gode swerdys that were made of stell; her noble targys they gonne fonge: y dar say that thay dwelleden nou?t longe. so coraious and wy?t the gode knyhtys all To and to to-gedyr wentyn into the halle. ware hem nowe the saresynys &amp; kepe hem well fro the scharpe swordys y-makyd of stel! for they nar neuer to fere, y dar say, As thay thanne were atte mete that daye. Thanne by-gonne the kny?tys to go to hem ry?t oute atte dore fful coraious and wy?t, To &amp; to to-gedyr in gode Accordement: Roulond ?ede byfore as maystyr of the couent. Also sone as Rowland come in-to the halle, “Mon ioye!” he cryed amonge the lordys all. they lystyn her gode scharp Swerdys And leydyn on the sarsyns and schoven here berdys. they leyden on hande in euery halue: ther-at Dorinydale dovn glode ther nedyd no salue. Syr Olyuer ful sone the kynge of perce slowe: he smote hys body ato wyth-out ony bowe: ther nas non of the knyhtys that they ne dyden wel, with gode scharpe swordys y-grovnden of stel. where ther neuer sarsyns sythe the world be-gan bettyr y-seruyd at mete of so fewe men. they were so hampred that Ioye was to se, and chacyd aboute the halle, &amp; thay gonne fle. some lepe oute at the wyndows wyth grete durst And fyllen adown fro so hye that here nekkys to-brost. Balam by-gan to fle: nas he nou?t blythe: And Whenne Rowland that say he folowyd hym swythe, An gan to crye on hye: “sey, thou horyson! ?elde the, traytour, thy lyfe-dayes bene y-don.” when balam that herd, he was sore afly?t, And lepe oute at wyndowe as he hadden ben ly?t: Syxty fote of hey?te, y wene, he lepe adown. And Rowland hym folowyd as egre as eny lyoun, hym to haue y-take, y wote wel, thare; And smote in-to the marbylston a fot &amp; mare. “ffelowe,” seyd Oliuer, “ys he alyue ous fro?” “?e, for god,” sey Rouland, “ther-fore me ys who.” they gaderden vp that ther was and token the tour. Ihesu for hys mercy so sende hem socour! the brygge they vp-drowe: the barres forthe they py?t: the sarsyns layn with-oute al redy for to fy?t. But god hem kept &amp; hys modyr marye, And Charlys come hem to helpe wyth hys chyualrye, To ben her warant and bryng hom socour, Ne schulde they neuer ellys olyve come oute of the tour. Nowe praye whe to ihesu cryst for hys holy name to saue oure knyhtys and schelde hem from schame! lordyngys, wyl ?e lyth, for saynt charite, More of thys gest, ?yf yt ?our wylle be, Off the kyng balam that ys falle so lowe fful dep in a dyche vndyr the castell vowe? he swovned thryes &amp; keuered at last And stode vp &amp; in grete tene gan to crye fast: “wher er my knyghtys? cometh to me blyve but I haue ?our helpys, y schall lese my lyfe.” with that come to hym burlyaunt de Marmorye An sokebronde de membrys hys counceyl most priuye. theyn h[e] tokyn hym by the hond &amp; holpedyn him blyue. “Allas,” sayd balam, “ys Lucafer alyfe? My noble Covnselour &amp; my help I haue forlore. Allas, that ylke tyme that euer y was bore!” “lorde,” sayd socebrond, “the sothe for to mene, thyn own cownsayl hyt hath y-do &amp; that ys well sene; ?e cast all ?our wyll and ?our hert thou?t at ?our taylend that schall vs brynge to nought.” “suche yt ys to tryst in wommans lore! Allas, that ilke stovnd that euer sche was bore! but ?yt here fourty dayes be?t ful gone, we schull be a-vreke of hem euerychone. Myn hornes &amp; my bemes, do?th hem swythe blowe!” “syr,” sayd sakebrond, “hyt schall be don a-throwe. the day ys passyd, the sonne ys at declyne, Dwellys styll tyl to-morwe, that ys cownsell myn. by that ?our sarsyns wyl bene come that beyth fer &amp; ner.” “Sokebrand,” sayd balam, “of Covnseyll thou art cler.” “Allas, Allas, [for] Lucafer,” sayd the Ameraunt, “for he was my socour &amp; my waraunt; thoru? thes sory knyghtys y haue hym lore. Allas, tha wyle that euer they were bore. By the soule that y owe to my god Mahoun to ?elde, schall y neuer hennys to tovne ne to felde, Tyl the tour be take &amp; with strenthe y-nome And the knyghtys don to the foulest deþ that men conne, And fflorype for her loue schall be brent.” “by Mahoun,” sayd sakebrond, “god omnipotent, lord, ?our covnsell schall be don &amp; the tour y-take, with ?our owne chyuallrye er he hennys schake.” thay went to her logges for hyt was ner nyght, tyl apon the morowe the sonne schone bryght. when the sarsyns were y-come, so last the route fyue myle on eche halfe aboute. Nowe help oure cristyn knyhtys, the kyng that best may, that ben assaylyd with sarsyns bothe nyht &amp; day! y no canne se in no skynnes wyse howe they mowe askape withouten any queyntyse. Balam had a Maystyr, for-sothe as y telle the, the queyntyst nygramancer that euer myght be. “Mambyn,” sayd balam, “alse euer mostowe sclepe, ffecche me my gyrdyll that my doughtyr hadde to kepe. Ellys schull the knyghtys haue al her wylle, whyles that they hyt haben schull they not spylle. ?yf that thou my?ht that gyrdyl gete to me syker of thy warysoun thanne schal thou be. for wyle they haue the gyrdyll syker, y tel the, Mete &amp; drynke schul they haue grete plente, Coraious and hardy batayl to make.” “syr,” sayd manby, “y hyt vndurtake, Er thys ny?t y-passyd be and the day y-come, y schall haue the gyrdyl fro the mayden y-nome.” “Manby,” sayd Balam, “y am glad and blythe: y pray to Mahoun that thys day were y-passyd swythe. whenne the nyght was kome &amp; the day laft, the thef went to the tour with hys wycchecraft. with chaynys and barrys the dyche lay wyde &amp; depe: the thef with hys wycchecraft ouer hem all he lepe. Nowe ys that schrewe thare-Inne at hys own wylle. A kandell he ly?t &amp; stalkyd ful styll: To chambyr he come, hys wycchecraft to sayn: the dores that weren loke and-vpponed hym agayn. he put in hys honde; the charme was sayde; and the knyghtys aslepe as they were dede. tho was a burgayn knyght, y-kyd ful wyde, that was in a chambyr a lytyl ther by-syde; and stode &amp; lokyd oute at wyndows, as y tell the, the schyppys to &amp; fro, he sey, sayle in the see. Nolde that thef manby neuer blynne Tyl he com to þe bed that the mayde was Inne. The thyf ate fyrst the gyrdyl tok on honde And dude hit a-bouten hym and fast to hym bond. He turned ful sone to that mayde bry?t; To haue for-lore the damesel he hadde ty?t. So hard he hur grypte to don hys vylonye That the mayde waked and lowde gan to crye. Tho sayde the lady that lay in the tour: “Where be?t my kny?tes that schulde be my socour?” ffor thys thyf schal dylyuer me out of my wytte.” “By mahoun,” sayde manby, “so artou nou?te quite! Suffre me my wylle, &amp; do by my rede, Ere y schal magre the byreue the thy maydenhede.” Tho by-gonne the maydenes a-wake &amp; a-ryse: the ne?er they com the lady, the sorer the gonne gryse. Whenne they seye the thyf in here lady bedde, The thyf dude hys wy?t &amp; hys strengthe faste, That nere he hadde conquered the mayde at þe laste. Ne had oure lord the soner hys grace sent, The floure of here madenhod hadde with hym went. Syre Gy herde þe noys, þere that he stode, And com in-to þe chambur as man that were wode. And whenne he sey þat thyf he cast vp a crye, “Lemman, ne drede the nou?t, for y am here fast by!” Whenne the thyf sey?e Gy, fro þe lady he lepe. Syr Gy tok out hys sword &amp; toke of hym gode kepe. The hed by the schulderys he smot of þat stounde: And þan quenched the candel &amp; he fyl doun to grounde. Thus was þe theues craft &amp; hys charmyng Whenne the Candyl was oute nou?t worth a ferthyng. The kny?tes gonne to wake and tho vp stert, As man þat weren fly?t with Swordes gerte. Whenne syr Gy hem say, he set vp a crye, And told hem of þe tresoun &amp; of þe vylonye. The thyf with þe gyrdel, þo þey toke vp ful blyue, And kesten hym into þe se and reuedyn hym of hys lyue, ffor neuer in all here lyf, sythe thay ware y-bore, Ne gete þe sweche a Iuel as þey haue y-lore. In-to þe see he was kast, þou? it were dere y-holde, Hem hadden leuer haue y-lore y toure ful of golde. Thanne toke they þe lady hem by-twene, ffor sche was ney out of wytte, y wene. Moche was þe ioye they gonne to make The kny?tes euerychon for þat ladyes sake. Now pray we for þe kny?tes þat beth in þe tour That god of hys grace bryng hem out of dolour! Now Speke we Off Balam, þat sory hethen kyng, That herkeneth after manby to here tyþyng! The day gan to spryng and þe sonne to ryse hy?e The sarsins cryden, “as armes,” bothe fer &amp; neye. Balam by-gan to hym take burlyaunt of marmorye, Sokebrant de membres, hys conselers mest preuye. “Lordyngys,” sayde balam, “what ys youre rede? Manbyn dwellyt so long, y trow he be dede. Were þat thyf on lyue, he wolde come a-gayn.” “Syr,” sayde sokebrant, “þe so?th y schal you sayne. youre trompes and youre Claryouns, do?th hem now blow And Comaundeth youre sarisins bothe hey?e &amp; lowe The tour to Assayle bothe ny?t and day aboute, Wyth engynys to caste: thanne wolle the knyghtys doute that they neuer lynne whyle they be?t on lyue.” “haue I-do!” sayd Balam, “that hyt were do as swythe!” tho by-gan the grete saute sone a-none, with engynys to cast many a grete stone. Off Stel and bras, quarels they let fle, Many thousandys at onys with-oute lye. sa last that saut by day &amp; be ny?t, seuen dayes &amp; more, y dar well say aply?t, with stokkys &amp; stones fast thrown heye with arblastrys an bowes fast schette they. thus with power &amp; bost &amp; with moche pride, Seuene dayes last that sau?t, that euyl mote hem betyde. Now helpe oure knyghtys, ihesu hewn kynge, that [be?t] byset in the tour with-oute mete &amp; drynk! y ne wite nou?t these noble men, thou? they lese my?t, that were with-oute mete seuen dayes &amp; seuen ny?t. Rowland wex ful pale &amp; so dud Olyuer, And eythyr made hys mone that routhe was to huyre. Dame florype couthe here nothynge be-mene, She feld down to grownd &amp; wex pale &amp; grene: And whanne gye that sey, ful wo was that knyght, he toke her in hys armys an dressyd her vp-Ryg?t, And gan to crye and sayd tho ful subythe, “lordyngys &amp; felows, wyl ?e to me lythe! the sarsyns ous assaylyth faste echon, And mete &amp; drynke vs faylyth, seuen dayes ben gon! And thys mayde dye in oure companye, hyt schall tourne vs to schame and vylonye. For that ilke lordys loue that deyde on a tre, For vs synful wrecchys that sore agreuyd be, Me had leuer for her loue, that scho hole betydde, To suffyr on my body An C Wovndys wyde. but swythe ‘as armes!’ and to batayll vs dy?t, And lepe we on oure destrers that gode ben &amp; ly?t, And wende we to her logge with scheld &amp; with spere, and oure payement schall be redy with Swerdys cler! For vs ys bettyr in batayll our scheldys to welde thanne to dye in thys fermorye ere Ravnsom to ?elde!” the knyghtys sayden tho al ful sone, “Syr gye, what wyl ?e that we done?” “lordyngys,” sayd floryp, and knelyd hem byfore, “Me thenkyn that ?e thynkyth longe, ?oure lyues ner y-lore; Best yt ys that ?e knowe of oure goddys my?ht, Mete &amp; drynke y-nowe he woll sende ?ou aply?t.

Roulond was þe fyrst þat by-gan to ryde And “monioye, lordyng!“ þanne he cryde, “Spede ous þys ylke day in ihesu cristes name, And þat oure dedes mowe turne þe sarsins to schame.” At the fyrst gynnyng, þey gonne Iuste of warre: And roulond slow alle þat ney?ed hym ner, Many was þe sarsin þat þoru? þe hals was hewen. Alle rennyng on blode were þe feldys wyde: Tho dorundale adoun glode nolde no sarsin abyde. So þay hem bar þe kny?thes þoru? here strengthe, That þay dryuen a-?en þe sarsins a furlong in lengthe. Many a lyfles body on þe grounde lay: And many an hauberk to-broke of þe sarsins þat day. Roulond held dorundale, þe pomel on gylt; Many was þe sarsin þere-with hys lyf he hadde spylt. Nas þere no sarsin þat wolde hym abyde, That he ne clef hys heued into þe chyn þat tyde. So wel duden oure kny?thes in that ylke stounde, That the fyrst scheltrom thay felt hem to grounde. And with that come claryoun, dryuand as fere, (A tyraunt ful coraious and of ful grete power, The ryche kyng balam was hys cosyn: he was the most schrew in alle paynym.) wyth twenty thousand sarsins wel armed and dy?t, That folwedyn hys baner al redy to fy?t. Roulond thus criede on gerarde de mountendre And on gy de burgoyne and on denys oger: “Lordynges, for goddys loue, fond we ous to spede, ffor neuer in alle oure lyf-tyme ne hadde we more nede! And make we now the sarsins red blod to swete, And gete we ous som mete or that we lete. ffor thay that louyn thys, with damesels in chambyr [to] pleye, ffonde we thys ylke day to gete the maystrye.” Roulond hent dorundale with a freche wylle: Moche blode of the sarsins that day gan he spylle. he ?af terry of perce suche a benediccioun, that he clef hys body a-doun in-to the arsoun. Nas none of oure kny?thes that they ne deden wel, with gode scharp Swerdys, y-groundyn of stel. here strokys were scharp and made woundes wyde: Was there so sarsin that hem durst a-byde. Where olyuer smot, to the grounde it wente a-doun, And made hem to fle on eche half as partrych the faucoun. Whenne oure kny?thes hadden fau?t in that ylke stounde— What wounded and slayn and layde to grounde— So that the place was y-heled alle Off bodyes and of red blod, ?yf y ne lye schalle, Wyth schame deyde the sarsins, wounded and slayn, Wyth sorw to tho that a-skepeden and turned a-gayn. Now pray we for these kny?thes that ioye hem bytyde. Well haue they y-don and homward gonne ryde. fful mery it is to here the harpe, Dysours and mynstrels to synge and to carpe. “fful mery it is,” thou?t roulond, “To fy?t a-?en the sarsins and to don hem schond.” A gret anger thay hadden and that was al here care, ffor mete and drynke, ne fond thay none thare. But whenne god wyl helpe and hys grace sende, Whenne bale ys aldermest, bote ys ful hende. Ne hadde they but o myle, sechyng on the playne, A welle fayre aduenture come dryuyng hem agayne,— xxti someres, y-trossed alle ful ry?t, With brede and wyn and lardyr, al redy y-dy?t. A sarsin of egremoyne come, dryuande by-fore. To wrotherhayl that tyme that euer he was bore! fful sone they hym perceyued and ne?eden ful ner, The ryche duk neymes and the skot gylmere. What helpeth hit to telle or more to say,— Thay smyten of the heuedes and leddyn for?th the pray. Wyth that com claryoun, dryuande blyue,— Many a cristen man he hade brou?t of lyue,— And gan to crie that men my?ten se: “hennes, ?e traytours, or ?e schulle dede be! And swythe ?eldeth to me, as traytours recreaunt, here ?e schulle deye ry?t here thour? myn hand.” Gy de burgoyne that woord vndyr-name And turned hys schyld whenne that he came. Ere euer my?t syre Gy hym a-reche in that stounde, hys gode stede was slayn and brou?t to grounde. Tho twenty thousand there come with that deuyl claryoun, Be-setten oure kny?thes, and tho to Gy that nobyl baroun The sone syr Gy was adoun y-falle There come xxti sarsins and fellyn on hym alle: hys helm they vnlaced, wolde they nou?t a-byde. The helm fylle in the feeld a-doun tho ful vnredy. “Allas,” sayde syre Gy, and syked sore, “Now schal y neuer se charlys, my cosyn, more!” “By mahoun!” sayde claryoun, and rode fast by hym, “Y here by the wordys that thou art of hys kyn. To-day thou scha[l]t be honged with ful muche sorw.” “Nay, thour? the grace of heuene kyng that schal me borw!” In gret yre were the kny?thes eft ffor that syre Gy was ham be-reft. Thay lefden the pray and nold hit no lenger lede, And olyuer hym be-thou?t as man that hadde nede. Sone he rau?t to hym a pece ful of wyn, And to swannes that were y-bake wel and fyn, ffyue white loues; and turned hys destrer: And wenten in-to the tour the kny?thes al in fer. The brygge was a-valed, the kny?thes ly?ten doun, And alle they madyn here mone for the good Gyoun. Whenne floryp that herde, that they nere y-come alle Anone sche went here doun in-to the halle. “ffor goddys loue,” seyde floryp, “where ys Gyoun, That went in ?owre companye? haue the sarsins hym y-nome?” Whenne sche seye roulond, loude she gan to crye. The good kny?t roulond with hert sory,— The teres of hys ey?en gloden a-doun hym bye,— “Damysel,” he sayde, “for godys loue that sytteth on hye, Ne greueth ?ow nou?t moche, y crye ?ow mercy! he hys in hethen hond and therefore ar we alle sory. he hys take with sarsins, and to balam lad, y wene.” Thryes sche swowened and wex pale and grene. The kny?thes to here stert and areyseden here on loft, and holpen here vp fayre and setten here soft. Whenne sche was a-ryse, sche turned here agayn: “Syre roulond,” sche cride, and gan to sayn: “By that ylke lord that tholed woundes fyue, ?ow ne schal waraunt no man on lyue! But ?e feche a-?en my lord that ?e haue lore,— To wrotherhayl the tyme that euer ?e ware y-bore!— I schal ?elde the tour with-Inne the thrydde day And ?e to be don to deth the foulyst that man may.” Tho by-gan Roulond hys hert to quake ffor hys felow Gy and that maydenes sake. “Damysel, y pray ?ow at ?owre owen wylle, Taketh to ?ow hert and hold ?ow stylle. By that ylke blod that god tok of oure ladyes syde, I schal suffre on my body a thousand woundes wyde, But I haue hym on lyue, syre Gy my cosyne, And bryng hym to-morw ere the sonne schyne.” “by that ylke oth that thou hast sworne &amp; ply?t, but thow holde me couenaunt to-morwe or hit be ny?t, Ne schal neuer kyng charlys, ne none of hys lynage Come in thys toure, ne none of hys baronage!” “Lordynges,” sayde roulond, “my counsayl y wyl to ?ow sayn, with-oute sorw and tene ne gete we hym neuer agayn. There ys none of us alle so vaylant in fy?t, And he fayle mete, that he ne scholde lese hys my?t.” “Lordynges,” sayde olyuer, “lateth be ?oure mone! Of a dyner y am ferst of vchone.” he tok forth hys pray and let hem alle se. Roulond sayde to olyuer, “y-blessed mot thou be!” The bordes were layde and the clothes sperd. The kny?thes and the ladyes made hem blythe glad. Now prey we for Gy that god be hys waraunt, That ys blyue fecched before the amaraunt! Thanne sayde balam and called hym on heye, “Telle me thy name with-outen eny lye!” “Syre,” sayde Gy, “y wyl it nou?t for-sake, Syre Gy the burgoyne y am, that ?e haue y-take. I com of charlys kynde and to hym y-swore and ply?t, And cosyn to syre roulond that ys so noble a kny?t.” “by mahoun,” sayde balam, “y know the wel! hyt is gon a month and more somedel That my dou?teryes loue on the was lent, Thoru? whom my toure ys takyn and my men y-schent. ffor a lytyl of thyng, y schal blyue lete fle of thy skyn whyles thou art on lyue. Sey me the soth and nou?t that thou lye, As thou wylt be saf fro schame and vylonye!

Wrother-hayle the now, balam, and charlys come were!” Whenne balam that herde, he was wroth in mode, And drow hym-self by the top and ferth as he were wode. Whenne the sarsins wysten that balam was in yre, A sarsin sterte forth as sparkyl doth on fyre, A strok he sette hym on the hed, there that he stode, That al a-boute hys schuldrys hit ranne on rede blod. “So god me help, thou dost me vylonye, Ne holde me for no kny?t, but thou it a-beye!” In hys berd hys fyggers he fest, And breyde hys chyn to hys brest that hys nekke brast. Balam thanne cryed, “What ys ous to bote? Taketh thys thef, and byndeth hym hond and fote!” Whenne thay herde that ameraunt so sayn, Al that my?t on hym hondes gonne layn. Wel was hym on lyue that my?t smy?t fyrst Eyther pylt hym ere byte with anye skynnes fest. With hornes, and bemes, outhas, &amp; crye, Schamely &amp; fowly thay ledden forth syre Gy, On the galowes to honge and there-on to be ded. A-boute hys neck, a cord was y-spred. “Allas,” sayde Gy, “that euer thys scholde be-tyde, That y scholde thys day thys schenful deth a-byde! Now pray we to oure lord and to oure lady, Sy?th that y schal to deth, on my Soule haue mercy! Where artou charlys with thy chyualry, That sufferyst me to haue thys felonye?

Whenne floryp that herde sche made a rewful crye. “The best kny?t on lyue, y crye ?ow mercy! Schulde ?e suffre my lord by-fore ?owre sy?t To haue suche a deth (why wyl ?e nou?t fy?t?), hit ne schal neuer be in no maner wyse, But alle thys world schal speke of ?owre cowrdyse.” ffloryp fyl a-doun by-fore the kny?t roulond, hys fot sche kest, the teres fro here wond, And sayde, “thou ryche and hende, the best kny?t on lyue! ffor godys loue,” sayde floryp, “he that me schal haue to wyue!

Lo, here ys the spere and the nayles also That longes pyt in hys hert, the blod ran there-fro.” The kny?thes on here knees, they fyl to grounde And blessedyn hem a-none in that ylke stounde, And criden to ihesu crist for hys holy name, That he schulde spede hem that day &amp; schylde hem fro schame, Glad was that mayde whenne sche sey in that tyde And fette hem alle stedes there-on for to ryde. here stedys they asayeden, they lyked hem ful wel, Thay castyn here schyldes hem by-fore,—the bokeles of stel. Coraious as a lyoun, y dar wel say a-ply?t, ffor to sle the sarsins, they dedyn al here my?t. “Lordynges,” sayde roulond, “for saynt charyte, Better ys a word by-fore thanne afterward thre. We ne be?t but xi to go ne to dwelle, And there ben of the sarsins mo thanne y can telle. And ther-for for goddys loue, fond We ous to spede, And with oure gode sverdys to make here sydes blede!

And the sarsins ben so wod ous to a-byde There ne schal fro the galwes none go ne ryde!” The maydenes sone led the brygge a-doun, The kny?thes wenten forth in cristes benysoun. They wenten to the galwes, the kny?thes sone a-none, ffor to helpe Gy to a-venge hym on hys fone. To wrother-hayle hem they cast vp a crye, “The glotons of ffraunce comen ous faste by, They wene with strengthe here felow to Wynne. Thay schulle honge euerchon er that we blynne.” Whenne duk roulond that word vndyrstode, he chaunged hys vysage, and al tremeled hys blod, And with the spores of gold, he smot the stede good. And oger smot hys in wel gret mod. Of graue haunchecler, for-?at he nou?t, That good was, &amp; trenchaunt, and wel y-wro?t. Many was the sarsin that proud was and kene, That lay woundyd &amp; slayn þat day in þe grene. There were heuedes to-rent and schyndred schyldes, fful ryche hauberkys y-rent þat leye in þe feldes.

That sarsin ded fyl vppon the playn And hys soule a-deuylway, ?yf y durst it sayn. Roulond by the brydel tok hys gode stede And ladde it to syre Gy, there-of he had gret nede. The bondys fro hys ey?en, sone he vnbonde And syre Gy ful wy?thly in-to the sadyl sprong. “Cosyn,” sayde roulond, “holde the by me fast!

Ere euer my?t the sarsin kast vp hys schelde, He was wounded and slayn &amp; layd in the feld. “Cosyn,” sayd roulond, “there-inne thou the dy?t! Thys ys good armur to the now a-ry?t.” Syre Gy ful sone of the best he hym dy?t, And armed hym there-inne for it was good &amp; wy?t. And whanne he was on hys hors, he gan to crye, “ffelawes, for goddys loue, mercy, y ?ow crye! Ne fayne ous no-thyng, dede al dou[n] to smyte, On the proud sarsins with swerdys that wyl byte!” Also swythe, y dar wel the soth sayn, A bow-drau?te &amp; more they dryuyn hem agayn. And so oure noble kny?thes fou?ten in that stounde, That—what woundyd and slayn &amp; brou?t to grounde— That there my?t no man go thorwe that playn, So thykke it lay of sarsins woundyd and slayn. And whenne oure noble kny?thes wende hem haue a-skape wel, ?ut there com a-nother, y-armed in yre[n] and in stel, With mo than twenty thousand al redy to fy?t, With swerdes and launces and scheldes bry?t.

So bare hem oure kny?thes that wel mote hem be-tyde, That alle were wounded and slayn that in batayle wolde abyde. Mayde floryp loked out at the tour, So red as any rose was here colour. The teres for here lemman, sche let renne stylle. Thanne sey she where he com, y-armed at wylle. Tho sayde floryp, “my ioye wexeth blyue, ?ut schal y haue my lemman to me a-lyue. ?ut for al the ameraunt, hym schal y nou?t mysse, That y schal my dere lemman bothe cleppe &amp; kysse.” These wordys herde Gy, and sayde to oger denys, “The mayde of here wordis ys ful curtays.

Wheder so roulond turned hys destrer, fful harde were the strokys that he dalte there. Syre Gy de burgoyne stert as he were wod: Many was the sarsin that day he let blod. hys gode swerd of stel in hys hond he fong, To wrekyn hym of the sarsins hym thou?t ful long. Was there no sarsin that durst hem a-byde, That he ne feld to grounde and made woundys wyde. Syre daryel, the kyng of durent, he clef in-to the teth with a strok that he sent. Thanne sayde roulond, “me thenk that thou canst wel To schastise the sarsins with thy swerd of stel.” home-ward, as they went, they by-held in a playn. Thenne seye thay a pray, comand hem a-gayn, A presaunt that was sent to balam the kyng, ffoure skore somers y-scharged with mete and drynke. Hastely duk nemes was war of that dede, And gerard de montendre that was good at nede, Oger denys, and duk terry also,— On foure half thay be-sette the sarsins tho.

Thorow the trust þat we han on hem, we ben schent; ffalsely they ous swyke and they ben worthy to be brent.” Balam gan to crye, nas he noþyng blyþe, “Thyf burlyaunt, fle fro me Swythe, That þu neuer after ne come in no plas!” He stert to a sarison, and tok of hym hys mas, ffor to sle burlyaunt þo he hadde ment. But the kny?t sokebrond, the stok for hym hent; And gan to crye and sayde to hym sone: “Ameraunt balam, what þenke ?e to done? Ne hys he ?owre consayl and youre best socour? Off alle þe kny?tes that ?e haue he bereth þe flour. Youre hornys and youre bemes doth hem blowe in hye And doth after my counsayle and leteth be thys folye. That youre sarisins were come, boþe fer and ner!” Balam bade hyt schulde be don with alle hys power. Whenne the sarisins weren com hym a-boute, ffyue myle large last þat route. Tho with her gynnes gonne þey to cast, In eche syde of þe tour, þe kyrneles þey brast. After þe sarsyns were so wod in yre, That þe mayster pyler of þe tour flamed alle on fyre, The kny?tes in þe tour þay gonne to crye, “Here to dwelle lenger, hyt were gret maystrye! Thanne for to ?elde vp þe tour, as kny?tes ouercome, Raþer we wyllyn deye, þanne here-Inne to be y-nome!” “lordyngys,” Sayd florype, “be?th of gode chere! Ne hath eche man but o lyffe, selle ?e hyt dere! y schall turne the fyr and the flames that ben ly?t A?en on the sarisins to brenne well bryght, thorow crafte that ?e couthe and queyntyse of gynne.” And the fyr sche turnyd on the sarisins with-Inne. the pauylons and the tentys, they stoden on the grownde, al to-brent in Colys, in frenche as hyt ys fownde. “Syr balam, what ys nowe thy rede? thorugh here tresoun ys thy tour lorne.” “wrotherhayle,” sayd balam, “that tyme that sche was borne! y commawnd ?ou sarisins, bothe hye &amp; lowe, vppon lyf and lyme, all men on rowe, To assayll the tour with-oute and wyth-Inne. ?e schull se sone by my god Appolyne, that they schuld ?elde the tour by the sonne schyne. y commawnd alle men for to schete fast, quarells to schete and engynys to cast!” the pylers weren of marbyll, ful rychely y-wrought, Endentyd with stel that it ne fayled nou?t. thay kaste so engynes in that ylke stownd that the wallys to-broston &amp; fellen a-down to grovnde. Euery knyght ther-Inne made grete mone: “here ys a febyl comfort for vs euerychone: longe to dwelle here, hyt were grete folye. Go we to batayle ere we ?elde the maystrye!” “lordyngys,” sayd floryp, “what ys ?our thou?t? the tour ys stronge y-nowe, ne dowte ?e nou?t. My fadyr hath her-Inne all hys tresorye, that he brought with hym out of barborye. whe schall cast it abrod amonge al the rowte. therwhyle thay gaderyn the golde, dar ?e not dou?t. And whan my fadyr sethe hys golde so spendy, he schall that saute sone defendy.” Sche ranne to her maydens, nolde sche not lette, And bade hem swythe of þat gold for to fette. And whanne sche sey the sarsins wodest &amp; kene, They þrewen out þe gold, þat bry?t was &amp; schene. And whenne þey sey þe gold þat was so bry?t, Thay gonne al to lete be here fy?t. Thre dayes and more for here couetyse That ?af as-saut for here queyntyse. whenne balam þat seye,—he stode with-oute,— Hys gold so y-sprede and y-cast a-boute, he by-gan for to crye and eke for to calle: “Lordynges, leteþ be þys saute, y comaunde ?ow alle! Thus to spend my gold and my tresorye That y haue long y-gedered, it is gret folye.” Anone þay wythdrow þe saut and þe fy?t And weryn ful fayne to gedyr þe golde bry?t. Nowe ben oure kny?thes vp in þe tour, Þay ne wenten of whome to haue socour. But oure lord helpe, and hys modyr marye, That charlys come sone with hys chyualrye, hem to waraunt and helpe &amp; brynge hem socour, Ne schulle oure kny?thes come out of the tour. “Lordynges,” sayde floryp, “ne haue ?e no doute: The tour hys strong y-now, with-Inne and with-oute. There whyle þat ?e hit hald, schal no man it wynne. Take we it alle in myrþe þat we haue here-Inne! ffyftene maydenes we be?t now here. Eche man chese hym a mayde þat hym lyketh to fere! y haue y-chose þere me lykeþ, my lemman Gy.” “Damysel,” sayde Roulond, “ye sey Curtesi; Thys ys a noble confort of suche a lady. Welle au?t ?e to be a lady &amp; welle y-tolde bye!” “By god, nemes, and by sent marye, Al to longe dwelle we in thys fermorye! Sende we after charlys þat ys of hye lynage, That he come ous to helpe with hys baronage.” “Syr,” sayde terry, “y wyl ?ow nou?t lye, Alle þe wordys þat ?e sayn, hyt nys but folye. þer ys none so hardy of ous y-chone, þat wolde take on honde, þat mesage to done. Ere he went a forlong out of þe playn Hym wer leuer þanne alle fraunce þat he were here agayn.” “By god,” sayde Roulond, “y it vndertake! y schal don þat message, ere euer y slake, As erly as eny daye, to-morow whenne it ys come.” “Mercy,” sayde neymes, “Roulond, grysly gome! Be ?e slayn or nome, by eny maner chaunce!— Ne schal neuer þe croune be douted in ffraunce!” Syre Gy de burgoyne so vp sprong, “By sent denys, ?e segge alle wrong! y wyl do þat message, so euer mote y thryue!” “Nay,” sayd floryp, “so euer broke y my lyue! Wende who-so wende, for y nyl nou?t þe mysse, þat y ne wylle haue my lord on armes to kysse.” þenne by-spak þe noble duk, Ricer of normandye, “lordynges, for godys loue, y you mercy crye, y am þe best of you alle to don þys message!” “Sarsyn,” sayde Richard, “let be þy foly! y ne haue mysdo ne seyd no felonye. Syre, suffre me to passe þys playn! Thy trauel schal be ?elde whenne y come agayn.” The sarsin answared, and gan to crye: “Thou ne a-skapyst nou?t for þy felonye. I nolde the suffre to gon on lyue, Thou? þu woldyst ?eue me kyngdomes fyue.” Whenne Ricer þat herde, he turned hys destrer A?eyne þat felle claryoun, with alle hys power. So þat claryoun smote Ricer suche a dynt, That fyr flewe out as sparche of flynt. In a cantel of hys scheld ys tok þe spere long, That the double hauberk al to-sprong. Thoru?-out hauberk and al hys gode wede The poynt at þat tyme in-to þe bar flech ?ede. Ne hadde oure lord gode helpe at þat ylke stounde, Richard hadde ben slayn and brou?t to grounde. Richard drew hys gode swerd al of stel, And smot to þat sarsin,—hym lykede it wel. The helm was good &amp; wel y-wrou?t, That þe strok stonyede and fayled nou?t. Tho was richard no-thyng blythe, A-nother strok [he] smot to hym swythe. By þat o syde of þat helm sumdel it trauercede, ffaste by þe schuldrys þe goode swerde perced. The helm and hood of þe kyng claryoun ffley of with þat strok in cristes malyson. The foule body of þat thef felle into þe place, And richard tok hys stede, so god ?aue hym grace. hys owyn he let go vppon the playn. And whenne he was vppe men my?t sayn, That he was to a-lowe in batayle and in fy?t,— So good a stede conquered and slayn so good a k[n]y?t. Rychard hym by-went to hys stede bausyn, Well sore he syked and sayde, “stede, thou were myn. By god,” he sayd, “thou art a noble stede, And ofte thou haste me holpe at my nede. Nowe thou schalt brydeles away fro me reche, Ihesu crist of hewn! y the by-teche!” he blessyd hys stede, and aftyr let hym go: the terys of hys ey?en ronne to his to: he turnyd hym, hastly &amp; blyue. with that come the sarisins dryuyng ryue: they fonde syr Claryoun, wowndyd and slayne, the hed fro the body lay on the playn. the sarisins tho cryed, and sydon blyue, “Alas, Claryoun ys ded, the best knyht on lyue! wy thus hathe do the messanger? whor ys he by-come? ?endyr renneth hys stede. go we! he were nome!” well was hym on lyue that swyftyst hadde a stede. Ac hit halpe hem lyte, ere that they ?ede. So that stede smote in that stowunde, that fourty sarisins he Slowe &amp; brought to the grovnde. hym ne my?t take of the sarisins no man, To the tour of Egremoyne the gode stede ranne. the Ameraunt Balam be-held in the playn And sey Richardys stede go dryuyng ageyn. tho he clepyd a sarisin of grete power, Syr Grandoun, the kyngys son, beschere: “lordyngys, be?t nowe blythe of that I schall ?ou sayn! y-slayne ys the messynger, the stede comyth a-gayn; well owt whe to thonke and to preyse our god Mahoun that so well hath wrought for the gode Claryoun. Swythe that the stede were to me brou?t!” They ronne there-after, it ne a-vaylet nou?t. Now pray we for these kny?thes that ben in the tour, That Ihesu hem confort of here dolour! ffor ?erne thay lokeden, sorwful and sory, ?yue god send eny grace of Ricer of normandye. Ac nemes hym be-went, &amp; loked in the playn, And sey Richardys stede come rennyng a-gayn, And sarsins to lacche hym, ?yf that they my?t. But none my?t hym take so wod he was to fy?t. A-none he called to hym Roulond and olyuer, “Lo, where comyth a-?en Ricer destrer!” “Allas, he went out of oure companye! I-slayn ys that noble kny?t, Ricer of normandye!” with sykyng and sorwe they made here mone. Roulond and olyuer wepte, and so dede echone. “Lordyng,” sayde floryp, “holdeth ?ow stylle! ?yf it is so be-tydde that god ha?th don hys wylle, ffor to make saw thus, to wepe &amp; to crye, There no bote may be, y holde it folye. ?ut wot none of ous alle the sothe to say . . .” Nowe wylle y dwelle and speke furþurmore Of balams folk that were a-greued sore. vppon a schylde they layden that sory claryoun, And for hym they prayden to here god Mahoun. And as balam be-helde vndyr the sonne bry?t, He saw hem bryngge a-mong hem a ded kny?t. Swythe vp he sterte and renne hem a-?ayne. “Lordynges,” he sayde, “hath claryoun the messanger slayn?” “Nay,” thay sayde, “be oure god mahoun, Owre gode kny?t ys dede, the noble claryoun!” who was wo but balam in that ylke stounde? “Allas,” he seyde, “that euer thys sorw schulde be founde!” Now lete we be thys sarsin wyth maysauntour, And speke we of oure kny?thes that god hem socour! The wyndowes were hey?e, al of marbyl cler: The kny?thes stoden ther-Inne and loked fer and ner. They sey the sarsins come in grete companye. Ranpand and galyand, [they] makeden moche crye. Thanne sayde floryp, “y can ?ow telle why That the sarsins make al thys sory cry. The ryche kyng claryoun, myn owyn cosyn, Saue ffirumbras, my brother, the beste paynym,— The dou?ty rychard as dou?ty kny?t Hath slayn claryoun thys ylke day in fy?t, And hathe wonne of hym, for-sothe certayn, Hys noble stede, vailand, ther-of ?e mow be fayn. Now y pray to ihesu crist, sent maryes sone, So saue duk richard in world where he be come!” “Damysel,” sayde roulond, “the kyng in trinite ?elde ?ow the tythyng that ?e haue told me! Take we now confort, that ere was for-lorn, ffor we be?t now more syker thanne we were to-forn! fful wel hath ricer y-do, god was hys waraunt That he hath conquered in batayle suche a tyraunt.” Now herkeneth alle, y pray ?ow paramour, And speke we of Richard, god be hys socour! The sarsins hym chased,—for-warry hem god!— Vn-to the ryuer that men calle flagot. As rychard hym by-wente and loked hym by-syde, And sey the sarsins come,—that sorw mote hem betyde!— Alle they swere by mahoun, here god, Thay wold sle Richard and cast hym in-to þe flagot. “Now god,” sayde Ricer, “that syttyth in trinite, My socour and my waraunt to-day that þu be! ?if y do me to-day to the sarisins alle, To the deth y schal go, it may none oþere falle: And ?yf y ryde in-to thys water that ys smart &amp; kene, Y drenche me þere-Inne, it may none oþer be, y wene. By god þat ys my lord, þe kyng full of my?t, Ere y drenche me to-day, ?yt schal y fy?t!” with þat com a sarisin, duk Ricer to dryue, That was clarions cosin whylys he was on lyue. “A-byde, traytour! þu hast slayn my cosyn claryon! þou schalt dey thys ylke day, by my god mahoun! Swythe ?eld þe to me, þu traytour recreaunt!” “ffyrst,” sayde Ricer, “þu schalt haue a strok of myn hond!” Rychard blessede hym sone, and turned hym a-gayn, And smot þe sarisin with alle hys mayn, þ[r]ou?? helm and schylde and haberioun, Thorow scheld and bak þe strok glod a-doun, That þe swerd, as it ?ede, it made a wyde wounde, That þe sarisin my?t no lenger sytte a-down. Ther he fel ded, a-non in þe playn And hys soule a-deuylway, y dar wel sayn. Tho gonne þe sarisins to crye on mahoun, Bemes gonne they blowe, and hornes of laton, Speres to braundische and fast for to schake, To assayle Ricer nolde þey nout slake. And, whenne he hem sau? so irous and felle, ffast for to fle, nolde he no langer dwelle. he hyd hys ey?en, and leyde hym a-doun, And to þe fader of heuen he made an oryson. “lor, þat alle þys world weldest at wylle, and madyst Adam by-fore under an hylle, of a mayde thou were bore, that moche was of my?t, to saue hem that were forloren thoru? Adams vnry?t, And aftyrward were on Rode streynyd euery lyth, And out of thy syde ran the blod ther-wyth, As wysly, lord, thou be my warant, And let neuer the sarisins a?en me stant!” And ryght in hys prayer and in hys gode entent, herkeneth wyche a grace god hathe hym sent! An hert shewyd hym Richard by-fore, as wyte as mylke vppon the more. whenne he hym perceyuyd so louely y-core, wheder so he ?ede the hert ?ede by-fore. ther that the water was dep, brod, &amp; wyde, the hert ?ede al esyly to the myd syde. the way was perilous, the knyght my?t drede, the hert knewe the way, and by-fore ?ede. And, tho he was ouer, he gan to sayn, ful Iolye &amp; blythe, he turnyd hym ageyn, And thonkyd “that ilke lord that syttyth in trone, that to-day thorugh thy grace hast herd my bone! wel au?t y to loue hym that of sorowe me hath nome.” but he ne wyst where the hert was by-come. A bowe drau?t, wel y wote, was that water brode, the depnesse of four spere lenthe that the hert ?ede. wel au?t we to loue Ihesu crist a-boue, that so redy ys to helpe for cristenmannys loue. Nowe ys duk Richard ouer that grete flode, And the sarisins in that othyr syde in grete ire &amp; mode. whenne they com to flagot, loude they gonne to crye, “Allas, we comen to late! wat don oure mametrye? nowe ys the messenger [gon], ne may he nou?t by cau?t!” whenne they sey the sothe, eche with othyr fau?t. Now let we be the sarsins—that sorw mote hem betyde!— And speke we of richard, that forth gan ryde. hys good swerd he bar hym by-fore, he strayned hys styrapys, nere thay nou?t y-lore. By hylles, and valeys, and cleues, grete &amp; strong, Tyl he com to charlys, Ricer thou?t long. Ere euer my?t richard come to charlyoun, Atrechered was here mete and ful of tresoun. Off oure good barones that werne in the tour in prisoun And weren dampned to the deth thoru? falce gwylyoun. Now y wyl make my dwellyng, And speke forth of charlys the kyng, That was in gret anguys and in gret dolour, ffor hys good kny?thes in egrymoyne tour, That he ne my?t here of none er[th]ly gome Of lyf ne of deth where they were by-come. Sory and so[r]w-ful was kyng charlyoun. he sent after hys steward gwylyoun; Syre Amery de Serbn, that was good kny?t; And the erle aubry, that moche was of my?t; The duk reynere of grane, that noble bachyler, That ful carful was for hys sone olyuer; And othermo that weren hym most priue. “Lordynges,” sayde charlys, “lysteneth to me! Telleth me ?owre counsayl, as ?e be to me sworne, Of my gode barons that y haue thus y-lore! But y mowe on lyue haue hem agayn, By sent Denys now y schal ?ow sayn, y schal to-day for-sake myn heritage, And ?yld vp þe croun a-mong my baronage! God and oure lady,” sayde þe Emperour, “So saue hem, bothe Roulond &amp; Oliuer, &amp; send hem socour! And ?yf hem my?t and strengthe with-Inne a lyte space To ouer-come her care þoru? þyn holy grace! ffor by þat ylke lord, god omnipotent, Be Roulond and Olyuer ouercome, cristendom ys y-schent! y ne schal suffre in fraunce, no bellys ryng, In Chyrch ne in chapel, no prest mas to synge, Ne in none oþer plas halywater to spryng, No non bokes, godys name worchipyng.

Be my dussepers ouercom, to god a ?yfte y ?eue, Ne schal I neuer worschyp god, whyles þat y leue.” Syr ffyrumbras answard hym a-gayn, “Syr, let be þese wordes, for þey be nou?t slayn. Pray we for hem to god þat sytteth in mageste, As he ys ful of mercy, on hem he haue pyte! And sche þat fayled neuer, heuene quene marye, Sche be here gouernour &amp; schylde hem fro vylonye!” Charlys þo graunted after hys rewful mone, To Ihesu cryst, of heuen kyng, ful rathe he made a bone, As he ys kyng in trinite, and lord ouer all þyng, “Off my dusseperes haue pyte and out of care hem bryng!” Off all þe men þat þere were, nas þere none blyþe, But þat thyf Gwylyoun, he answarde swyþe: “Syre emperour charlys, y ne schall nou?t lye. Doth after my counsayl and let be þys folye, And y schall ?ou rede to do wysly for eny maner chaunce. ?oure pauylons doth trusse and wendyth in-to ffraunce, To saue ?our Crowne and ?our erytage And al-so ?our-self and ?our baronage.” Tylle syr Gylyoun hadde spoke, Charlys sat stylle. the wordys of that traytour hym lyked ylle. “lordynges,” sayd Charlys, “?e hered alle here the cownseyll of Gwylyoun that ys my conceller, That y schulde in-to fraunce turne ?ow a?eyn. Than my?t it be-tyde, that alle men my?t sayn— To lese thus my dussypers, that in batayle ben wyse, Alle the wyde world wolde speke of my cowardyse!” Syre Aubry vp stert and tok vp a crye, And gryffyn de Serbn and other that stode hym by, wel a-boute a thousand that weren of hys kyn,— Al were sworne to Gwylyoun and no man to hym. Syre charlys hym thonketh, that it hys best reson ffor to don after the counsayl of syre Gwylyoun. There were ten thousand, y dar wel say, That were swore to turne hem agayn. “Now roulond hys ded and al hys companye, Thyder for to wend it were but foly!” “Lord,” sayd charlys, “god omnipotent, And whenne y am in care and in mautalent, Thus to lese my kny?thes that were my socour, who-so redeth me that rede, he loueth nou?t myn onour.” God, for mary loue, curse Gwylyoun and hys kyn, The fadyr and the modyr that he was fyrst In! ffor thoru? hys falce counsayl, y dar wel sayn, charlys was in wylle to turne hom agayn. In the way of morymond lay charlys, the emperour, In moche sorw and care and in gret dolour. hym thou?t as he sat, ?yf godys wylle were, that the erthe hadde opened that he my?t haue sonke in there. but ther our Lord woll helpe, ne dar no man doute. In alle the sorowe that he was he lokyd aboute. Donwarde in a mountayne with well grete spede, he sey come a knyght apon a fayr stede. And as charlys hym sette on ihesu crist to crye Euer hym þou?t þat it schulde be Ricer of normande. fforth he gan to calle, nolde he no lenger a-byde, Thay þat wyst hys counsell stode by hys syde. “Lordyngys, lysteneth to me, y pray you a-ry?t! Dounward in þe mountayne, ?ende y se a kny?t: y do you to wete and nou?t for to lye, he semeth wel for to be, Ricer of normandye. I pray to Ihesu cryst for hys woundes fyue, he send me tyþyng, ?yf my kny?tes ben a-lyue.” with þat com Richard of normandye wyl swyþe, And whanne charlys hym se he was glad &amp; blythe. Oure emperour charlys, with hym a nas no dwellyng, he cleped to hym rychard, and asked hym tyþyng: “As þu art my gode kny?t and my Bacheler, How faren my cosyns, roulond and Olyuer? And all my kny?tes? for hem y am in care, Be þe quyk or ded, tel me how þey fare? “Syr,” sayd Ricer, þey ben all on lyue, Vyalent and hardy, batayle to dryue. In þe tour of Egremonye þey byn be-seged a-bowte, with an C M sarisins þat ben fers and proute. The Ameraunt ys a wondurfull tyraunt, he hath swore by mahoun and termegaunt, þat þey schull o þennes on lyue neuere gon, þat they schulle be honged and drawe euerychon. Thay haue me sent hedyr as a messenger, That ?ow schulde come hem to helpe with ?owre power, ffor thay haue to helpe an heye in the tour The kynges douter, balam, that hys here socour, floryp the curtays that ys so fayre a may.

To wrother-hayl balam and al hys companye!” “Syre, to smyte on eche half, y dar wel say a-ply?t. So ben the sarsins redy for to fy?t. The passage that men passyn hys hedyous and oryble. The water hatte flagot, the brygge mautryble. The walles ben of marbyl &amp; ?ow sey a-boute, I-baytaled redy with-Inne and with-oute. The porter ys a geaunt; the sothe to telle, he ys lyche a deuyl that were broke out of helle. Ten thousand sarsins wel armed &amp; dy?t, whenne he wyl blowe hys horn, [ben] al redy to fy?t.

Mow we þe fyrst gate entre with-Inne, Thorow þe grace of god, more schul we wynne!” “Now, lord,” sayde charlys, “yf yt be thy wylle, As Richard hath sayd, help to ful-fylle!” The kyng dude hym arme double, &amp; dy?t (fful erly in þe morow þe sonne schone bry?t), þe someres to trusse in gyse of marchaundye, And dude hem toward mautryble in fayre gyse. Rychard yede beforn as he hadde ben a grome. Ihesu cryst of heuene kyng, hem socour sone! Whenne þe geaunt sey al the kny?tes come, he went it hadde byn a pray þat sarisins hadde y-nome. ffor to wete what it was, he dude ys entent. A-?ens hem swythe, he toke þe gate and went. he sette hym with-oute on a marbel ston. A fowler deuyl þan he was, sey þey neuer none. he held an ax in hys hond, muche and vnryde, þe byt y-grounde scharp,—to fot it was of brede. he was brod and thykke in bale and in bak. Brod were hys ey?en, hys browes euyl y-schape, hys nose Brod and Croked, hys schyn as a nape, hys schulders, wonder thyk,—a gloten to fede. To large elne, y wot, he was of Brede. Swart teþ: and blo and ?olw was hys swyre: Bothe blak, and lothely, and grysly of chere. In alle maner wyse, euyl was he schaped: he semed a deuyl of helle þat out was a-schaped. Constable was he, and hadde in kepyng þe Brygge of mautreble vnder balam þe kyng, þat no man schulde passe, neyþer loude ne stylle, But it were at hys grace and hys wylle. Now oure kny?tes þe way haue y-nome. Rychard was þe fyrst þat to þe brygge come. Gulfagor hym be-went, and kast vp hys sy?t, “whennes artou, page, and whedyr art thou ty?t?” Ricer was queynte and torned hys langage, “we be?t marchauntes of aragoun to passe thy passage, with sykelatoun and sendal and purpur of prys, with ryche clothys off gold that ben of gret prys, To honour oure mahound and oure mamotrye And oure ryche feste that ?e haue don crye, To schewe and to selle to oure ameraunt. we pray ?ow of leue to be oure waraunt, Thre dayes to dwelle, the forthe to come agayn.” “Blythely,” sayde Golfagor, “y it graunte for certayn.” he bredde vp the brygge, and down he let it falle, he ne let In no mo thanne foure of hem alle. “here ne passe na mo, but goth and do ?owre beste!” The brygge vp he cast and schyt it faste. “By god,” sayde Ricer, “here ys none other help But that we ben y-presond, but god be oure help. ?yf euer were we kny?thes, kythe we and fond we! That thys deuyl were slayn, fayn wolde y se. Thay kesten of here capys, and here swerdys gonne fong. ffor godys loue, heye we, and dwelle we nou?t long!” They smytyn to golfagor, the knythes alle a-boute: he was so y-armed, ne thurft he no man doute. he was y-laced in a skyn of a dragoun, That no swerd ne my?t come there-Inne, ne no skathe don. The by-gan golfagor for to pekke mod. he went an hax in hys hond, as a man that were wood. ffor to sle Ricer, he turned hym to, But god Hym saued, he dude nou?t so. The geaunt fayled of hys strok, and by hym it glynte, ffer in-to þe marbyl-ston, or it wolde stynte. Tho smot þe sarsin, with so egre yre, þat richardis heued flamed al on fyre: þe precious stonis and þe gold schene Broston al in pecys, &amp; flowyn in þe grene. “lord,” sayde Renere, “ihesu, almy?ty kyng, þat we mowe ouer-come thys deuyl in fy?tyng!” He ly?t adovn swyþe of hys gode stede, And a gret leuer sone vp he breyde. he let fle a strok at þat thef with hys hond: hyt fyl a-doun by þe knees of þat geaunt. he ?af hym a strok in þat ylke stounde, þat bothe hys schuldrys brest and fly doun to grounde. Richard ful sone let þe brygge falle, And ?af hys felowes entres and bad hem come alle. Richard tok hys horn and blew also Swyþe, whenne charlys þat herde, he was glad and blyþe. “Monioye!” he cryde, and loude gan to calle. Well was hym þat to mautryble come fyrst of alle! þat day dude Gwylyon a ful good dede: lite whyle it last, y-schent worth he to mede. Charlys was þe fyrst: er euer wolde he blynne, he wan þe brygge hym by-fore &amp; entred with-Inne. he hyede hym swyþe, nold he nou?t a-byde, And sey golfagor stray on hym wyde. “Euyl þryst on þey heued, with þy foule vice! þu hast ben a moche schrew in thyn offyce.” And al hol as he was, the foule tyraunt, Charlys kest hym ouer the brygge with hys on hand. hys wyf lay in Chyldbed by-syde in a kaue, of too knaue chyldren,—that sorowe most they haue! four fet of brede in the brest, y-tolde, And of to fethem hey, [hey] were a monthe olde,— ffycoun with beryl,—that sorowe mote hem betyde! And he ?ede to the gate and opened it wyde, And by-gan to crye in a sory part: “where artou, charlys, thou sory fabelart? wenestou so ly?thly oure relykes to wynne? I schal do the to wete, ere thou come here-Inne!” whenne charlys that herde, he kast vp hys scheld, hys noble swerd, trenchaunt, in hys hond he helde. he let it fle to fycon in that ylke stounde, And clef hys heued in-to the teth, þat he felle to grounde. Thanne þe gode kyng charlys by-gan to crye, “Be now of good confort, ricer of normandye!” To erl, baron, and to goode lordys, and hys kny?thes, And many good bachiler, þat þere was in fy?tes. A strenger saut þen þere was, ne my?t none be, Thanne þere was at mauutryble to men þat my?t it se. Many an helm of stel fly to þe grounde, And scharp y-grounde speres made many a wounde. So muche blod was spylt and lay on eche syde, Many a sarsin hys deth loste þere-Inne þat tyde. whenne amyet þat herde, þere sche lay in here bedde, That here lord, fycoun, was brou?t to dethe, Sory sche was and nothyng blythe. Dwelled sche no lenger, but went forth swythe, And brayde vp a tre, moche and vnryde, And as a deuyl of helle to þe gate sche ?ede, That was of yren wrou?t with ful gret gynne, The barrys endentyd with stel with-oute and with-Inne. Sche brayde vp a vyket and hente vp a tre, “who ys now so hardy for to come to me?” was þere none dou?ty in þat ylke stounde, And sche hym rau?te, þat he ne scholde go to grounde. “Lord,” quod charlys, “þat alle hath in hande, Thys quene ys a deuyl, as y vndyr-stonde Sche hath slayn of my kny?thes many one. ffecche me an arblast and bryng me a ston!” Charlys hent an arblast, and a quarel he let flen, And in-to here heued, it wente thoru? þe brayn. Damysel amyet fyl a-doun to grounde. ffyftene thousand hadde þere deþes wounde. Now hath charlys with strength &amp; with maystrye y-wonne þe brygge of mautryble with vyctorye. “Lordynges,” sayde charlys, “?owre counsayle ?e moste sayne! who schal kepe þe brygge, tyl we come a-gayn?” “Parfay,” sayde firumbras, “doth as y ?ow rede! Raoul ys a good kny?t to kepe it at nede, And Hoel of Nauntes, a good kny?t in dede, with fyue thousand in here felarede.” “By god,” sayde charlys, “and by my cristyante, ffirumbras, as þu hast sayd, so schal it be!” Oure noble kyng charlys forth gynneth to ryde forthe in-to Egremoyne,—that Ioye hym betyde!— with Erlys and barons in hys companye, And an hundred thousand of noble chyialrye. Charlys hathe wonne Mavtryble with maystrie And slayn the porter and the gate y-take. ffycoun &amp; Amyet ganne hij to quake. “Allas, Mahoun, and oure mametrye, theues and traytours that ?e beth, sore ?e schull abye!” he toke a mase in hys hende &amp; went to hem faste, And ?ede to the synagoge, the dore vp he braste. “ffy on the, traytour Mahoun, thou falce wycked theef!” And smote hym on the heued that was hym nou?t lef, he that hadde all paynym in kepyng, he set Appollyn on the heued, with-oute more dwellynge. Tyl syr Sokebrond by-gan for to crye, “Syr,” he sayde, “letteth be! ?e doth gret folye! ?e wete well that Mahoun ys of grete poste to venge at hys wylle bothe the &amp; me.” whan the Ameraunt was oute of ire y-brou?t, Off that he hadde mysdo, mercy he be-sou?t: he fel a-dovn to Mahoun &amp; by-gan to crye, “Nowe, lorde, that thou haue on me mercye!” And on knees he sette hym a-down &amp; gan to Mahoun crye, hym to amende of hys trespas &amp; of hys felonye. Ryght of the best gold of all hys tresour, he made Mahoun Riccher thanne euer he was or. “Syr,” sayd sokebrond, “dothe as y schall ?ou sayn! ?our engynes dothe sette to the tour ageyn, And leteth hem neuer blynne ne neuer slake, tyl the tour be ?elde and with strenthe y-take!” wel sone was the belfray y-wynched &amp; y-bounde, with ten thousand sarisins in a lyte stounde: with pykes and with ord neuer nolde they late: they broken A pese oute of the walle of a kart-gate. Syr nemes stert forth with humilite And fette forthe the Crowne &amp; the naylys thre, And so he dyd the spere that was in goddys syde the voluper &amp; the sudary nolde he nou?t abyde. the sarysins that gonne clyme, in that ilke stovnde, ther-wyth weren blent &amp; fyl to the grownd. “Nowe, lorde,” seyd neymes, “nowe y thonke the! nowe we be sykyr, the sothe may we se, that these beth the naylys of goddys passioun.” And for gret Ioye on knees he fyl a-down. as Rouland hym went, &amp; syr Olyuer, and Oger denys, the gode bacheler, the sey in a kaue, a lytyl hem bysyde, Termagaunt &amp; Appollyn with moche pride. Rouland tok termegaunt, &amp; Oger, Appolyn, And Olyuer, Margot, that were of gold fyn. In dyspyt of Mahoun, that the sarisins my?t se, thay kesten hem in-to a slowe, here goddys all thre. “Allas,” sayd balam &amp; by-gan to crye, “that suche a dispyte scholde be don to oure mametrye! ne neuer schall y ete mete, ne glad ne blythe be Tyl that y on ?on traytours mowe a-wreke be!” A strangyr sau?t thanne ther was, my?t non be, with engynys to caste, that hydous was to se. As neymes hym be-wente &amp; loked be-syde, he sey a semble, y-sprad ful wyde, with lavnces areryd: hym thou?t in hys wyse, “Charlys baner of frawnce, the kynge of sent denys!” “lordyngys,” seyd nemes, “pur saynt charite, beyth nowe glade &amp; blythe &amp; letyth sorwe be! for out in the valeye, y se in the playn, I wene ous cometh to helpe, kyng charlemayn.

By the weye of pees, he gan to ryde, The sarsins comen hym a-gayn with wel moche pride. “whennes artou, and whedyr artou ty?t?” “In message to balam ys my wyl ry?t! Sent y am fro charlys and hys baronage, Maugre of echon to passe thys passage.” he smot the stede with hys sporys with al hys my?t, And sprong forth to balam, as a noble kny?t. By-fore hym he houed with hys helm bry?t And ful wel spak to balam as a good kny?t. “Thou sarsin balam, thou cursed kyng! Thus comaundyth charlys, and sendeth the tythyng: That thou for-sake Mahoun and al hys mametrye, And by-leue on Ihesu crist and on hys modyr marye, And ?elde vp the relykes that thou hast in kepyng, And alle hys kny?thes with-oute more dwellyng; And he schal suffre thy londe in pees and in gryþe; And thy self be so bold to seye nay þere with, þu schalt ben honged and afterward to-brent.

A-gayne þoru? al þe ost, he smot hys destrer, Was þer neuer a sarisin þat ne?ede hym ner. Whenne he Com to charlys, he tolde hym a blyue, “Syr Emperour so ryche, þe best kyng on lyue, Syre, y was at Balam in hys pauylon, (God that ys in heuene, ?yf hym hys malysoun!) here y hadde haluendel my wordys y-spoke, he Comaunded swythe on me to be a-wreke, And Bad al hys sarisins, þe falce schrewen, þat in-to smale pecys þey schuld me hewen.

In Euery schyltrom were, coraious and wy?t, Mo thanne ten þousand in Batayle to fy?t. The proud sarisin Balam, the Emperour of Nubye, Come with twenti thousand sarisins in hys Companye, And gonne to crye as wood as any fer, And sone callyd to hym, hys mayster consaler. “Burlyaunt,” he sayde, “þu art myn owyn fer, To helpe me and socour with all þy power. Tow schalt wende by-fore, þu art my dere And an C M schulle folowe thy Banere. And ?yf þu fynde charlys or euer þu slake, Saue hym quyk on lyue and to preson hym take!

To wroþer-hayle the tyme þat þu come in thys playn! Swythe ?eld vp thy Croun to Balam the Ameraunt Ere thys day thou schalt þoru? myn hande . . .” whenne Charlys þat herd, he gan to quake, hys launce to Braundysche and fast gan to schake, And “Monioye!” he gan fast to Crye To ffyrumbras and to Ricer of normandye. was þat word but of hys mouþe sayde That Bothe partys fast on oþer leyde. Many was the dou?ty man in þat ylk stounde, That dyden on both half and felt were [to] ground. ffayre was þe wedyr, the sunne schon Bry?t, Tyl hyt was passed myd-day and thoru? to the ny?t. Many was þe modyr sone that lay in þe feld, And many cast here spere and her schyld. The Batayle on neyþer half nolde not blynne. whenne ffyrumbras com, it was to by-gynne. ffor also swyþe as he cam in-to þe place, he spared no man: y sey by my face, That he slow and woundyd in þat ylk stounde Mo than twenti thousand þat layn on the ground. Oure cristenmen,—y-blessed mote þey be!— ffou?ten so faste þat wery weren he, Tyl þe dussyperes þat weren in þe tour Come to help and bryng hem socour. The brygge was a-walyd, the ?ates were vn-don, They blessydyn hem in godys name &amp; wentyn out echon. They seyn sone, y-woundyd hem by-fore, Many a stede y-steked and many a sarisin þoru? bore, Scheldes and launces, and fauchouns also. helmes and heuedes leyen in peces þo, That were woundyd and slayn and to grounde þrowe, As poudre þat were brent &amp; with wynde y-blowe. with ful good speres þat were scharp y-grounde The kny?tes þat comyn out of þe tour made many a wounde. Oure noble kyng charlys, ful coraious in yre, Sprong as sparcle doth of þe fyre. And after oure kny?tes speres weren in peces y-broke, They drou? here goode swerde, wel to ben a-wroke. The dyntes off dorundale ne dorst no man a-byde: ffirumbras smot with florent and made woundes wyde. y-scomfited were the sarisins and alle here companye. And whenne balam that y-seye, loude he gan to crye, “Allas, mahoun and alle oure mametrye, That ?e suffryn ous to dye and haue thys vylonye!” he smot hys stede with alle hys power, hys noble swerd he hent, as wood as any fyre. he slow a noble kny?t, Gauter of tardys, And syre maugys, and Geffrey of parys. whenne kyng charlys that sey, and it be-helde, “Monioye!” he cryede and kest vp hys schylde. hys good swerd he held, in hys hond ful faste, A-?eyne balam he went tho in haste. By balames schuldres, the good swerd glynt, And smot of the stedys nekke, ere it wold a-stynt. That the sarsin balam to erthe fyl adoun. Ne lay he nou?t long, y swere by sent symoun! he stert vp ly?tlyche and hente hys good brond, That the stede vndyr charlys to the grounde wond. fful sone charlys stert vp as a lyoun, And schamed sore that he fyl a-doun: Neuere by-fore in batayle ne in fy?t Ne made hym no sarsin of hys stede a-ly?t. Ry?t in the place there they bothe stood, The sarsin hew on charlys as he were wood. So he hew on charlys in that ylke stounde, That in fyue places of hys body, he made hym a wounde. Oure noble kyng charlys, ful coraious in yre, A strok he let fle at balam, as sparcle on fyre, Ry?t a-boue on hys helm that was so strong, That the flames of fyer brosten out a-mong. So glynt that swerd that hit withstode, And sone a-doun of balam ran the rede blod. And so euen a-doun the gode swerd went, ffer in-to the erthe er it wolde a-stynt. Thanne by-gan the sarsin to pek mode, And stared with hys ey?en as he were wode; Hys grete thycke targe by-forn hym [he] cast, And brayde on an anelas and helde it faste. Ne hadde oure lord Ihesu holpen that stounde, Ne hadde neuer charlys go more on grounde. And ere euer my?t charlys a-reche hym with a dynt, So come Roulond, as sparkyl doth of flynt, And aubery de nantes, and syre olyuer, Syre bernard de mountendre, and Denys oger, Duk nemes, and the skot gylmere, Syre bausyn de senyk, and terry de peytere, Syre Gerard de orlyaunce, &amp; Ricer of Normandye, And syre ffirumbras with alle hys chyualrye. Syre ffirumbras, hys fadyr adoun he gan caste; And syre olyuer to a stede hym bond faste. fful sone ffirumbras kest vp a crye, “Syre ameraunt so ryche, y crye ?ow mercy! ffor-saketh mahoun and ?owre mametrye, And byleueth on ihesu crist and hys modyr marye!” “A thef, glotoun!” sayde balam of Nubye, “hastou for-sake mahoun and hys mametrye?” “By mahoun, my lord, y wyl nou?t leye!” “And y hadde now the in my bayle, y schulde do the sorw, by mahoundys face, Ry?t be-fore myn eyen in a cawdryn of bras!” The ryche kyng charlys comaunded a-none, “Bryng to me balam, by-fore me sone!” Duk terry, with-oute more dwellyng, kest hym on a mule ful softe beryng. To the tour of egrymoyne al the ost went, Mo thanne tweynty thousand in good entent. whenne the sarsins y-sey the ameraunt y-take, They that my?t fle a-wey they gonne to schake. “Lordynges,” sayde charlys, “y comaunde that there be A funstone y-halwede In the name of the trinite, That balam be cristened and cristenman to be, And to by-leue on ihesu crist as do now we.” Kyng charlys after balam sone gan sende: Roulond and olyuer after hym gonne wende. To bryng hym to charlys thay were ful fayn. “Balam,” sayde charlys, “do as y schal sayn.

Ne schalle y neuer on hym byleue, thou? y schuld brenne, ere hyt were eue!” whenne firumbras herd that he nolde nou?t Cristendom to take, ne turne hys thou?t, he turnyd hym a?en to Charlys, the kynge: “lorde, dothe ?our wille and make no dwellynge!” “lordynge,” sayd Charlys, “swythe dothe me telle, who schall thys paynym sle? he ys a fende of helle.” “parfay,” sayd Oger, “that was wel y-sayde! Curtays ys a noble swerd!” and Swythe out hyt brayde: And with balam he dude hys wyl sone. ffirumbras hyt hym for-?af, as hym fyl to done. ffloryp the curtays kest vp a crye, “Syr Rowlond, holdeth me couenant vppon ?our mercy!” “So god me helpe, that ys skylle!” sayd Rouland, “Syr Gy, thys mayde, take thou by the hande!” “blythely,” sayd Gye, “&amp; by my lewte, ?yf my lord Charlys wel apayed wyl be!” “by god,” sayd Charlys a-non to syr Gyoun, “y ne schall be ther-agen in felde ne in town!” Whenne floryp that herde, nolde sche not slake, that Cristendom sche wolde anone at the funston take.

Of Ciclatoun and purpre, so was al her wede, And to her thay were brou?t in dede. And al here othyr maydens that were in the tour,— All they weren cristynyd with grete honour. Charlys toke by the honde that fayr lady: Rouland, and Olyuer, and Duk Terry ledden her with grete mekenesse to-fore the boschope to huyre hys messe. To haue &amp; to worchype by day &amp; by ny?t, Syr Gy and the lady were trowthe ply?t. The Crown that was balams with many a ryche ston, Charlys sende ther-aftyr, and hyt come anon: ffirumbras went a-non vp to the tour And brou?t hyt fayre to the Emperour. Nowe hath Charlys y-crownyd syr Gyoun: the byschop hym sacryd and ?afe hym hys benysoun. Of that kyngdom Ryche that balam helde, he ?af to syr Gyoun bothe town and felde. whenne the londe was stabled at syr Gyes wylle, tho ne durst no man do hym a?eyne neythyr loude ne styll. hyt was apon a soneday in the mornynge, Charlys herd messe in goddys blessynge. whenne messe was don, Charlys sayd blyue To quene floryp, the fayrest lady on lyue: “To-morwe wyll y wende in-to fraunce agayn. why beth ?e so vncurteyse as y schall ?ou sayn?
