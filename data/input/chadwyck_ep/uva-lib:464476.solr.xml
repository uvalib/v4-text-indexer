Ne is lyues man non so slei?e Þat he ne þoleþ ofte ennoy?e Jn many cas, on many manere, Whiles he lyueþ in werlde here. Ac is þere non, fole ne wys, Kyng, ne duk, ne kni?th of prys, Þat ne desireþ sum solas Forto here of selcouþe cas; For Caton seiþ, þe gode techer, Oþere mannes lijf is oure shewer. Naþeles, wel fele and fulle Beeþ yfounde in herte—and shulle— Þat hadden leuer a ribaudye Þan here of God oiþer Seint Marie, Oiþer to drynk a copful ale Þan to heren any gode tale. Swiche Ich wolde weren out bishett, For certeynlich it were nett. For hij ne habbeþ wille, Ich woot wel, Bot in þe gut and in þe barel. Now, pes! listneþ, and leteþ cheste— ?ee shullen heren noble geste, Of Alisaundre, þe rich[e k]yng, Þat dude by his mais[t]res teching, And ouercom, so J fynde, Darrye of Perce and P[o]re of Ynde, And many oþere, wi?th and hende, Jn to þe est werldes ende; And þe wondres of worme and beest— Deliciouse it is to ylest. ?if ?ee willeþ sitten stylle, Fulfylle Ich wil al ?oure wille. Whilom clerkes wel ylerede On þre di?tten þis middelerde, And cleped hem in her maistrie Europe, Affryke, and Assye; Ac Assye also mychel is As Europe and Affryk, jwys. Wise men also founden þere Twelue shedynges in þe ?ere, Þe ?er to lede by ri?th ars. Þe first was ycleped Mars, Þe oþere Auerylle, þe þridd May, Þe fierþe June in lengest day; Þe fyfte Jule, þe sexte August, Þe seuenþe Septembre, þou mi?th trust, Octobre þe ei?tteþ, þe nynþe Nouembre; Þe tienþe moneþ is Decembre. Geneuer was þe elleuenþe þoo, Feuerel þe twelueþ, and nomoo. Names of planetes so beþ yhote; Summe beeþ chelde, summe beeþ hote. By hem men han þe seysyne To londe, to watre, to corne, to wyne, And alle chaunces, nesshe and hard, Knaweþ by hem men ylerd. Who-so wil þe nature ysee, Hij moten yheren Tholome, For J ne may, by Goddes ore, Þerof now telle nomore. Ac whi Ich habbe hem þus vnleke ?ee shullen me after her speke. Barouns weren whilom wijs and gode Þat þis art wel vnderstoode, Ac on þere was hoten Neptenabus Wijs in þis ars and maliciouse. Whan kyng oiþer erle com hym to a-werre, Quyk he loked in þe sterre. Of wexe he made hym popatrices, And dude hem fi?tten myd latrices; And so he lerned, ieo vous dy, Ay to afelle his enemy. Mid charmes and myd coniurisouns, Þus he assaied þe regiouns Þat hym comen to assaile— Jn pure manere of bataile, By clere candel in þe ni?th He dude vche myd oþere fi?th. Þus he lerned, Ich ?ou telle, Hou he sholde his fon afelle, Of alle manere naciouns Comynde by shippe oiþer dromouns. At the last, of many londe Kynges hadden of hym grete onde. Wel a þritty ygadred beeþ, And bispeken alle his deþ— Kyng Philippe, of grete þede, Maister of þat felawrede, For he was man of mi?tty honde. Myd hym he brou?th of dyuers londe Nyne and twenty riche kynges, To maken on hym bataillynges. Neptenabus it vnderstood— Achaufed so was al his blood (He was aferde sore of harme). He made his wexe and cast [hi]s charme. His ymage he made onon, And of his barouns euerychon, And afterward of his fon, And dude hem togedre gon Jn a bacyne, al by charme. He sei? to hym fel þe harme. He sei? þe slau?tte of his barounes, Of hise þe destructiounes. He loked and knew in þe sterren Of alle kynges þe grete werren, And sei? his de[þ] ?if he abyde. Michel sorou? was hym myde. He ne couþe no better di?tt, Bot out of londe stale by ni?tt. Nyst þere non þat hym was nei? Whan he out of londe flei?. He degysed hym onon Þat hym ne knew frende ne fon. He flei? away fro toun to toun, Þorou? many straunge regioun. Soiournyng non he nam, To Macedoyne forto he cam (A riche cite, þou vnderstonde, Jn þe herte of Grece londe). Neptanabus sore is anoyed, For Philippe haþ his londe destroyed, And he is in Philippes cite, And þinkeþ ?elde his iniquite. Of golde he makeþ hym on table Al ful of sterren, saunz fable, And þenkeþ siggen amonges men Þat he is an astromyen, For of astronomye and nygromaunce Couþe non so mychel, saunz dotaunce. Averylle is mery and langeþ þe daye: Leuedyes dauncen and þai playe. Swaynes justneþ, kni?ttes tournay, Syngeþ þe ni?ttyngale, gradeþ þe jay; Þe hote sunne clyngeþ þe clay, As ?ee wel yseen may. Jn þis tyme, Ich vnderstonde, Philippe is in Neptenabus londe, And haueþ ydon to þe swerde Þem þat nolden myd hym acorde. Olympyas, as J fynde on bokes, Þe cite of Macedoyne lokes. Kynges Philyppe quene she is; Of lyuyng ladies she bereþ þe prijs. Neptenabus in þe cite was. Ac hereþ now a selcouþ cas! Jn þis tyme faire and jolyf, Olympyas, þat faire wijf, Wolde make a riche fest Of kni?ttes and lefdyes honest, Of burgeys and of jugelers, And of men of vche mesters. For men seiþ by north and south Wymmen beeþ euere selcouþ— Mychel she desireþ to shewe hire body, Her faire here, her face rody, To haue loos and ek praisyng, And al is folye, by heuen-kyng. So dude þe dame Olympyas, Forto shewe hire gentyl face. She hete marshales and kni?ttes Greiþe hem to ryde onon-ri?ttes, And leuedyes and damoysele Quyk hem greiþed, þousandes fele, Jn faire atyre, in dyuers queyntise. Many þere roode on riche wise. A mule also whyte so mylk Wiþ sadel of gold, sambu of sylk, Was ybrou?th to þe quene, Myd many belle of syluer shene Yfastned on orfreys of mounde, Þat hengen nei? doune to grounde. Forþ she ferde myd her route, A þousande lefdyes of riche soute. A speruer þat was honest So sat on þe lefdyes fyst. Foure trumpes toforne hire blew. Many man þat day hire knew— An hundreþ þousand and ek moo, Alle alouten hire vnto. Al þe toun byhonged was A?eins þe lefdy Olympyas. Orgnes, chymbes, vche manere glee, Was dryuen a?ein þat leuedy free. Wiþouten þe tounes murey Was arered vche manere pley. Þere was kni?ttes tourneying, Þere was maydens carolyng, Þere was champouns skirmyng, Of hem, of oþere also, wrestlyng, Of lyons chace, of bere baityng, A-bay of bore, of bole slatyng. Al þe cite was byhonge Wiþ riche samytes and pelles longe. Dame Olympias amonge þis pres Sengle rood, al mantel-les, And naked-heued, in one coroune She rood þorou?-out al þe toun. Here ?elewe her was faire atired Mid riche strenges of golde wyre, [And wri?e]d here abouten al To her gentile myddel smal. Bri?th and shene was her face; Euery fairehede in hir was. Of þe folk lewed and lered ?auen hire prijs of þe middlerd. Neptanabus in þe weye stood Myd polled heued and of his hood. Of her fairehede, saunz fay[l]e, He had in hert grete meruayle. Jn hir he loked stedfastlyk, And she in hym, al outrelyk. She hym avised among þe pleye For he was nou?th of þat contreye. She asked his beyng in hast. [He was abasched and] agast, And þou?th, ?if he myd tale duelld, A þeef he shulde ben yhelde. ‘Dame’ he seide, ‘be þou nou?th looþ— Jch am ycome to telle þe sooþ.’ She was adrad he shulde telle Þing of shame, and nolde duelle. More she þou?th þan she spaak. Away she roode from hym, good shak, And þou?th she wolde hym yhere Whan she was of leysere. Gamen is good whiles it wil last, Ac it fareþ so wyndes blast— Þe werldelich man, and lesse and maast, Here leue þere-inne so wel waast. Whan it is beest to þee henne it wil haste. Me wondreþ þat men ne beeþ a-gaste, And þat somme hem by oþere ne chasteþ. Olympyas her herte [c]asteþ After þis game deliciouse. She þencheþ on Neptanabus. She clepeþ to hir ane sweyn Þat is hire vnderchaumberleyn, And Neptanabus after sendeþ; Þe chaumberleyn hym after wendeþ. To hir chaumbre he comeþ on hast. Of her fairehede he was agast. Toforne hir a-knawe he satt, And she hym seide onon, myd þat: ‘Me þinkeþ,’ she seide, ‘maister, jwys, Þat in þe sterren þou art wys. Saye’ she seide ‘for my loue, Who drou? þee so hei?e aboue Swiche maistrie þee to tache?’ ‘Dame’, he seide, ‘J nylle þe nou?th bicache. By þe planetes and by þe sterren J can juggen alle þe werren, Alle ple?es, alle metynges, On erþe and alle oþere þinges. Þorou? þat art, Jch sygge þee, J can þe goddes pryuete.’ And Olympyas hym asked þoo: ‘Why bihelde þou me so Now toforne in þe vys, Þoo Ich roode to wynne prys?’ ‘Oo! madame,’ he seide, ‘Olympyas, Hei?e maister in Egipte J was. On a day, after redyng, To goddes J made sacrifyeyng. On ansuere me was yseide. Þou shalt nou?th þerof ben ennoyed, Ac þank me conne, lefdy free, Þat Ich com hider to warne þee.’ Þe lefdy lijþ on her bedde, Yhiled myd a silken webbe. Jn a chaysel smok she lay, And in a mantel of Doway. Of þe bri?thede of her face Al aboute schoon þe place. Selde she spaak, and nou?th loude, And so don wymmen þat ben proude. Þat was wel in his herte— Jt dude hym good to duelle, certes. His aristable he took out sone. Þe cours he tolde of sonne and mone; Þe cours of þe planetes seuene He tolde also vnder heuene. Þe sonne he shewed in hir al Þat had colour of cristal; Þe mone in propre nature Of adamaunt bare þe coloure. Þe lefdy he dude also conne Hou she took ly?th of þe sonne. Mars was swiþe reed fere lyche; Venus was þe saphire ylyche. Mercurye he made gres-grene, And Jouyne so metal shene. Þe lefdy sei? al þis, saunz fayle. Þere-of she had grete meruayle, And seide to hym: ‘be þou nou?th looþ Me to telle of oo þing sooþ. Maistres me habbeþ ytolde, by dome, Þat wha[n] my lorde is hom ycome He me wil away dryue, And taken hym anoþer wyue.’ He loked jn his aristable. ‘Jt is sooþ’, he seide, ‘saunz fable. Ac of oo þing J nylle þee nou?th gabbe— A knaue-childe þou shalt arst habbe Þat shal be cleped god of londe. He shal awreke al þi shonde; Of alle kynges he worþe þe best, Þe werlde to wynne in to þe est. Amon, þe god of Lybye, Shal doune come from þe skye To þine bed, la, God it wete, And in þine body hym bi?ete. Greiþe þee now, and faire þee kepe— To-ni?th þou seest hym in þi slepe.’ For folye al it helde þe quene, And seide soþe it mi?th nou?th bene, And swore, by Adam and by Eue, She ne wolde it neuere yleue, Ac ?if she hym sei? in metyng She wolde leue in swiche þing. His leue took Neptenabus, To his jn, wel yrous. Herbes he took in on herbere, And stamped hem in a mortere, And wronge it out in a boxe, And after he took virgyne waxe And made a popet after þe quene. His aristable he gan vnwri?en. Þe quenes name in þe wexe he wroot Whiles it was sumdel hoot. Jn a bed he it di?th, And al aboute candel-li?th, And spraynde þere-on of þe herbes juse; And þus charmed Neptenabus. Þe leuedy in her bed lay. Aboute myd-ni?th, ar þe day, Whiles he made his coniuryng, She sei? ferly in her metyng. Hire þou?th a dragoun adoune li?th To hire chaumbre and made a fli?th. Jn he com to hire boure And crepe vnder her couertoure. Many siþe he hire kyste And fast in his armes þriste, And went away so dragon wylde; Ac gret he lete hir wiþ childe. Þoo he lete redyng on his book, Olympyas of slepe awook. She was a-grised for þe nones, Þat alle quakeden hire bones. Anon by a message gent After Neptanabus she sent; Al þat she sei? she hym telde. She seide, ‘sir, God þee for?elde! On vche manere it ferd soo. Fro me shaltou no-whider goo, Ac loke me and bileue stille Forto Ich wyte þi lordes wille.’ He bileued, wiþoute sorowe, Myd þe lefdy al þe morowe. Hire bed was made by hym, forsoþe, Myd pelles and myd riche cloþe. Þe chaumbre was myd cloþes of golde Byhenged so þe maister wolde. He voided þe chaumbre of men vchon, For, he seide, þat ni?th Amon Shulde come to þe leuedy, And ben her leef and her amy (And hym-self was kni?th, and swayn, And boure-mayde, and chaumberlayn!); Forto it well forþ ni?ttes was Jn bed wook dame Olympyas, And aspyed on vche manere ?if she mi?th ou?th yhere Hou Amon þe god shulde come. Neptenabus his charme haþ nome, And takeþ hym hames of d[r]agoun, From his shuldre to hele adoun; His heued and his shuldres fram He di?tteþ in fourme of a ram. Ouere hire bed twyes he lepeþ, Þe þrid tyme and jn he crepeþ. Offe he cast his dragons hame And wiþ þe lefdy playeþ his game. She was þolemood and lay stille; Þe fals god dude al his wille. Also oft so he wolde, Þat game she refuse nolde. Þoo þe cok crowe bigan, He seide to hir, ‘gentil lemman, Jch habbe bi?eten on þee a kyng Þat shal be Philippes maisterlyng. On erþe worþe non hym yliche— He shall conquere many kyng-riche.’ And afterward, in þe daweyng, He makeþ eft his charmyng, And smyteþ of hire be[d] in to his, So he it nere nou?th, jwys. Þoo his charme ydon was, Vp hir stirte Olympyas, And telleþ to Neptanabon Alle þe affers of Amon, And he to hire—boþe acorde— Alle þe gestes of Amon his lorde. ?if he faile, mysauenture he haue! For he was lorde and eek knaue. Olympyas stant tofore Neptanabus Of her nywe loue wel desirous. So dooþ womman after mysdoyng, Ne can no shame ne no repentyng, Er she be lau?tte in her folye So in þe lyme is þe flei?e. She seide to hym ‘of maistres floure, Hou shal J take on wiþ myne amoure? Shal J any more hym yseen, Shal J anymore aqueynte hym ben? ?if he is god, he is kiynde, And wil me often come hende. His loue is also swete, jwys, So note-muge oiþer lycorys. Erþelich kni?th ne erþelich kyng Nys so swete, in none þing. ?if he is god, he is mylde; Now he haþ brou?th me myd childe, He me wil solace and liþe And in þis care maken bliþe.’ ‘Care þou nou?th,’ quoþ þis losongere, ‘Jch am Amonns messagere. Telle me amorowe þi wille free, Ani?th he shal myd þee bee. Ac it wil gode skylle ?oure pryuete þat þou hele, For onde of kni?th ne baroun, And ne wraþþe þi god Amon.’ Swiþe bliþe was dame Olympias Of Neptenabus g[il]ful cas. She maked hym her chaumberleyn Ouere kni?th and ouere sweyn, And hym bitook alle here kayes, And her kepyng by ni?th and dayes. Neptenabus al dooþ his wille Wiþ Olympyas, ac euere stille, Also it were þe god Amon. Þe lefdy greted wiþ newe bon. Þe barouns hadden suspecioun, And senten saie kyng Philippoun. Yhereþ now hou selcouþe lijf Comeþ to shame, sorou?, and strijf. Whan corne ripeþ in heruest-tyde, Mery it is in felde and hyde. Synne it is and shame to chide, For shameful dedes springeþ wyde. Kni?ttes willeþ on huntyng ride— Þe dere galpeþ by wode-syde. He þat can his tyme abide Al his wille hym shal bityde. Þe quene greteþ myd quyk bon By þe fals god Amon. To Neptenabus she seiþ hire mone, And askeþ what hire be to done. She dredeþ hire lorde Philippoun Hire wil forsake for þat chesoun. He bad hire make hardy chere, And seide Amon was of powere To kepe hire from encombrement: ‘And þi fruyt shal be so gent Þat he shal þee so awreke Þat alle men shullen þere-of speke.’ Þe leuedy hire conforteþ þus. Þat ilk ni?th Neptenabus Made so stronge sorcery, And adressed it by þe sky, Þat it com to þe pauyloun Þere þat lijþ kyng Philippoun. Also he lijþ in slepe by ni?th, Hym þinkeþ a goshauk in grete fli?th Settleþ on his herbergeynge, And ?yneþ, and sprat abrode his wenge. A dragoun of his denne gan flei?e, Whan he þat goshauk ysei?e, And settleþ sone after þas On stede þere þe quene was. Sone so he þe quene fonde, Jn hire mouþe he blew a bronde. Þere-after nou?th swiþe lang A lyoun at hire nauel out sprang. Þe lyoun smoot in to þe est; Ne durst hym wiþstonde beest. Þe goshauk of hym was a-gast, And awook hym wel on hast. Þoo kyng Philippe of sleep awook, Alle clerkes wise on book He dude ofsende, most and last, And telde hem þis sweuene in hast. On þere was, hi?th Abyron, Wisest clerk of euerychon— ‘Sir’, he seide, ‘here my steuene. Swiþe selcouþ is þi sweuene. Þe goshauk of whom þe þou?th Js þi-self, wery of-fou?th. Þe dragoun is sum sterne man, Oiþer a god, so ich þee telle can, Þat haþ leyn by þi quene, And bi?eten a sterne strene. He shal be kynges alle aboue, Bitwene þis and heuen-roue. Whan þou comest to þi londe, Þe soþe þou shalt vnderstonde.’ Þe kyng her-of took grete sorou?, And took homward myd his folk amorou?. He fonde al sooþ, wiþouten noo, And asked who hire greiþed soo. She seide þat she was amye To Amon, þe god of Lybye. Þe kyng was wrooþ (no wonder it nas) þat his wijf wiþ childe was. Fewe wordes to hire he seide; Louryng semblaunt on hire he made. He þou?th on hir awreken ben Whan he mi?th his tyme seen. Þei? Neptenabus nolde speke, Wel he þou?th hire awreke. A day it fel þe kyng a feste Wolde helden, swiþe honeste, Of dukes, of princes, of barouns, Of kni?ttes of his regiouns, And after make bymeny[n]g Of his wyues mysdoyng. Þai comen to þe kynges sonde, Gentyl men of fele londe. To þe mete þay weren ysett, Ne mi?tten men ben serued bett, Noiþer in mete ne in drynk; Bot þere-aboute nyl ich swynk. Ac þoo þai shulde bere vp þe clooþ, Vche of hem so bycom wrooþ, For a dragon þere com jn fleen, Swithe griselich on to seen. His tayl was fyue fadem lang; Þe fyre out at his nose-þerles sprang. By þre, by foure, myd þe tayle To þe grounde he smoot saunz fayle. Wiþ þe mouþe he made a beere So al þe halle shulde ben a-fere. Þe kyng had wel grete hawe; Alle his barouns to chaumbre drawe. Þe lefdy ?ede vnto þe drake. He lete his rage for hire sake, And laide his heued in hir barme, Wiþouten doyng of any harme. Also þis folk abouten þrest Forto see þis selcouþe beest, On erne he bycam and out flei? Jn to þe skyes þat vche man sei?. Sone þerafter and nou?th longe, Fel a chaunce selcouþe and stronge. Of wilde beestes com a grete pray ?erned þorou?-out þe contray, And afterward a flok of bryddes, And a fesaunt hem flei? amyddes. An eye he leide, also he flei?, Þat fel þe kyng Phelippe nei?. Þat eye braak, ich ?ou telle; A dragon crepe out of þe shelle. Þe bri?th sonne so hoot shoon Þat þe eye-shelle al to-scroon. Þe dragonett lay in þe strate; Mi?th he nou?th dure for þe hate. He fonded to crepe, ich ?ou telle, A?eyn in to þe eye-shelle. Jt was to-broken, and he ne mi?th, And þere he starf onon-ri?th. Þe kyng it sei? and wonder he had. Alle his maistres he ofgrad, And seide he had þerof dotaunce, For it was som signifiaunce, And bad hem telle of whiche þing Jt mi?th be signifieyng. On þere was þat hete Antyfon; Wyser clerk ne lyued non Jn al þis werldes regioun, Jn art of estallacioun. He seide, ‘O, sir kyng, saunfaile Here is fallen gret merueyle. By þis ilk litel dragon Js bitokned þe quenes son. Þe eye rounde shal signifie Þat he shal habbe seignourye Of þis rounde myddellerd, Boþe of lewed and of lerd. Ac he shal wende of londe fer, To Grece and comen neuer ner. He shal be poysond saunz retours Of his owen traytoures. Þat signifieþ þe dragonett Ne may recouer to his recett.’ Tjme is comen þe lefdy shal childe; She biddeþ þe god be hire mylde. Þe þrowen hire afonge[n] gynne. Neptanabus biholdeþ his gynne, And seiþ to þe lefdy aloude, ‘Wiþholde þe, dame, and a?eyn croude, For ?if þou childest in þis stounde, Þi childe shal be myd sorou? bounde, Coward, feynt, and nou?th worþ. Wiþhelde þee ?ut, and bere þee forþ.’ She wiþhelde hire wiþ al hire woo, So þat she ne childed þoo. Ac sone after a þrowe hire cam; Anoþer shryke þe quene vp nam. ‘Now is wers’, quoþ Neptanabus, ‘And þou childe in þis hous, Jt shal be a þing vneste— Heued of cok, breest of man, croupe of beest.’ Jn hire sorou? ?ut she lou?, Of hire childyng and hir wiþdrou?. Ac sone þere-after hire was so woo So þat she ne mi?th goo, And he loked in þe planete. Þe tyme þoo hym þou?th swete, And seide swiftely to þe quene, ‘Doo, dame, now lete come þi strene, For he shal be [m]aster of londes, Gode werroure, mi?tty of hondes, Þe hardyest of lyuyng man— Shal hym no foo stonde a?ein.’ Jn þat tyme þat he þus grad, A knaue-childe þe quene hadd. Alisaunder he named was. Jn his beryng fel straunge cas. Þe erþe shook, þe cee bycom grene, Þe sonne wiþdrou?, shynyng shene. Þe mone hire shewed, and bicom blak. Þe þonder made many crak. Þe day bycom derk so ni?th. Afered was sore euery wi?th. Kyng Phelipp seide to þe moder, ‘Þou hast brou?th forþ an yuel fode. Mote he lybbe and þenne goo, Many man he shal do woo.’ Neptanabus took on bysmare Al þat þe kyng seide þare. He dude þe childe habbe noryce, Gentil leuedyes and nou?th nyce. Þe weder bicom mery and bri?th. Ataise hem makeþ lefdy and kni?th. Þe childe waxeþ a wi?th ?ongelyng. Now hereþ geste and ?iueþ listnyng. Alisaundre waxeþ a childe of mayn. Maistres he haueþ two doseyn. Somme hym techeþ forþ to gon, Þat oþere his cloþes on to don; Þe þrid hym techeþ to pleye atte balle, Þe fierþe afetement of halle. Þe fifte hym tau?tte to skirme and ryde, And to demayne horses bridel. Þe seuenþe maister techeþ his pars And þe wytt of þe seuen ars. Aristotle was on þerof. Þis is nou?th romaunce of skof, Ac storye ymade of maistres wyse, Of þis werlde of mest pryse. Was þere neuere, Ich vnderstonde, Nobler childe in none londe. Now can Alisaundre of skirmyng, As of stedes derayeyng, Vpon stedes of justnyng, And wiþ swerdes turneyeing, Of assailyng and defendyng, Jn grene-wood and of huntyng, And of ryuer, of haukyng, Of bataile and of alle þing. Þat wel vs hereþ God auaunce! Jn þis tyme fel a chaunce: Kyng Philippe pleyed in a pleyne. His man hym brou?th by a cheyne A grisely beest, a rugged colt, He had ylau?th in an holt. He presented it to þe kyng. Jt þou?th hym a selkouþ þing. Jt had a croupe so an hert, An heued so a bole, cert, An horne in þe forehede amydward Þat wolde perce a shelde hard. Jt was more þan any stede, And rede wete me mi?th it fede, Ac mannes flesshe leuere hym was Þan hay-rek oiþer corne-tas. Jn an out-hous, jn yrnen bende, Jt stood, and no man it hende. Alle þeues þat shulden ben ylore Men brou?tten þat hors bifore. He had soner y-eten a man Þan two champyons a han. Bulcyfal þat hors hete; Many man in his lyue he frete. Noman ne durst þere-on ycome Bot Alisaundre þe gode gome. Ne most noman it bistride Bot Alisaundre, ne on hym ride. To hym he wolde wel obeye— He most on hym ride and pleye. Neptanabus, vpon a daye, Mid Alisaundre ?ede forto playe, And tau?tte hym þe cours of sonne and mone, And al þing þat was to done. By sterren and by þe firmament He hym tau?tte, verrayment. Ac Alisaundre, er he it wist, Jn a pytt doune hym þrist. His panne braak a?ein [a] ston; Atwo crussht his nek-bon. Jn his deþ-þrowe he was swowe, And spaak to Alisaundre (ac it was low), ‘O, gentil kni?th! þou be biknowe For whiche þing þou hast me slawe.’ ‘What!’ quoþ childe Alisaundre, ‘Ouer al so ?ede þe sclaunder Þat þou haddest bi?eten me. Mi?ttestou nou?th in book yse Who þee shulde to deþ don, Oiþer þi frende oiþer þi fon? Anoþer man þou couþest auaunce, And by sterren telle his chaunce. Ne shaltou more man bigile; Jch haue ?olden þee þi while. Jch wene of deþ þou hast part— þine herbes faileþ, and ek þine art.’ Ac Neptanabus hym seide a?en, ‘My son Ich wist shulde me slen.’ ‘Artou my fader?’ quoþ Alisaundre. ‘?e,’ quoþ he, ‘sooþ is þe sclaunder; Jch wil wel þou it wyte’, And telde hym hou he was bi?ete. Alisaunder ran in to þe pytt And dude vpon londe hym sytt, And bare hym to Olympias And hire telde al þe cas. She ne mi?th it nou?th forsake; A pytt he dude sone make, And brou?th hym in his longe hous, And þus ended Neptanabus. Sooþ it is, vpe al þing, Of yuel lijf yuel endyng. Now is þe kyng wrooþ and grym, Who shulde be kyng after hym— His son Philippe, oiþer Alisaundre, Of whom he bereþ swiche sklaundre. He dooþ his temples alle bihonge Wiþ baudekynes, brode and longe. Oxen, sheep, and ek ken, Many on he dude slen, And after he bad his goddes feyre He most wyte of his eyre, Of Alisaunder and Philippoun, Who shulde haue þe regioun. A voice ansuered in an ymage, ‘Kyng, þou hast a colt sauage. Who so may þere-on skippe, Be it Alisaunder, be it Philippe, He shall of Corinthe toun After þee bere coroun.’ Þe kyng herd wel þis soun; So dude many gentil baroun. Þe kyng in to court wendeþ. Þe children sone he ofsendeþ. Bulcifal nay?eþ so loude Þat it shrilleþ in to þe cloude. Þai wenten alle to þe stable Þere it was tyed jnne, saun fable— For a þousande pounde of golde Philippoun it nei?en wolde, Ac Alisaundre lep on his rygge So a golfynche dooþ on þe hegge. He it vntyed and lete gon So of bowe flei?eþ þe flon; Fast he sitteþ, and halt þe rayne. Vp and doune he it may demayne, And dooþ in tourne in a ?erdes lengþe, And a-forceþ it wiþ strengþe. Nys he bot of twelue ?er olde— His dedes weren stronge and bolde. Fele weren at his li?ttyng þare Þat reuerence gret hym bare, And seiden it was worþi þing He were þe nexte crouned kyng. Mery tyme is wode sere: Þe corne rypeþ in þe ere, Þe lefdy is rody in þe chere, And maiden bri?th in þe lere. Þe kni?ttes hunteþ after dere, On fote and on destrere. Kyng Philippe sitteþ in his halle, Amonge his dukes and barons alle Þat he haþ somouned wyde To ben bifore hym on þat tyde, For he wolde in Corinthe toune Alisaundre his son coroune (Þat is, forto sigge ari?th, ?iue hym armes and maken hym kni?th, And maken couþ to alle gyng After hym he shulde be kyng). Kyng Philippe þat was his lorde Girde hym wiþ riche swerde, And ?af hym þe colee ari?th, And bad he shulde be gode kni?th. At þe yssue of þe doren Tholomeus dude on his sporen. Dubbed weren an hundreþ kni?ttes For his loue myd hym þere-ri?ttes. After þe seruise of þe dubbyng, He gooþ to mete wiþ þe kyng. Wel men mowe wite þere was plente Of mete and drynk and grete deynte. Ac after mete, onon-ri?ttes, Þe kyng of-cleped gentil kni?ttes (Jch woot it weren his tresorers); He hete hem charge seuen somers Wiþ riche rede jtried golde, And Alisaundre he ?iuen it sholde. Þai duden her lordes comaundement, And afenge faire þat present, And departed on gentyl wyse, Sum to kni?ttes of hei?e seruise, Sum mareschales, and botlers, To ?oman, page, and joglers. Alle þoo þat fongen wolde Ynou? hadden of rede golde. Alisaundres gode loos Of þat ?yuyng first aroos. A Kyng þere was, sumdel fer þenne, þat had greued mychel his kynne; He was yhoten Nicholas. Alisaundre his ooþ made has, He wil to hym wende onon, And wreke his fader of his fon, And grad aloude wiþ word kene, ‘Who me loueþ now worþe ysene!’ Þe stronge kni?ttes of þe halle Quyk ronnen to armes alle, And trusseden her somers, And lepen vpon her destrers. Wiþ her atyre shippes and barge Þai gonnen many forto charge. And olyfauntz, and ek camayles, Boþe hij charged wiþ vitailes. Alle to water þai don blyue, Þe þrid day and comen to ryue. Þai swymmeþ wiþ spreet, draweþ wiþ honde, And þe shippes bryngeþ to londe. Many kni?th, wiþ armes shene, Quyk þere lepen on þe grene, And maden many pauylouns To Alisaundre and hise barouns. Þere-whiles Alisaundre hym di?ttes Mid a partye of his kni?ttes, And wandred vpon a stronde, And mette þe kyng of þe londe, Þat hi? Nicholas of Cartage, Hardy man, stout, and sauage, Þat seide to Alisaundre onon, ‘Who ?af þee leue here to gon? Now quyk do þee hennes sone, For þou ne hast nou?th here to done.’ Alisaundre loked a-skof, As he ne had y?oue þere-of. Nicholas hym ennoyede, Wiþ wraþþe and to Alisaundre seide, ‘What doostou here, þou mysbi?ete gome? Bot for þine harme hider artou come. Fy, vyle ateynt hores sone! To mysdon was ay þi wone. Quyk take me þi wed for þis disray.’ Alisaundre ansuered, ‘Nay! Wed ne shaltou habbe of me, Ac Ich wil habbe wed of þee. Al þis londe þat þou telles þine And þi coroune so shal be myne. ?if þou wilt of londe fle, Þe may þe better sumdel be.’ ‘Fy on þee!’ quoþ Nicholas, And spat on hym amyd þe face. ‘Mowe Ich þee fynde after þis, J shal þe don bynde, jwys. Þou shalt ben honged and todrawe, And quyk of þine hyde yflawe. Afterward þou worþest ybarned.’ And quyk away he is y-arned; For had he abiden, any þing, He had abou?th his spaityng. Alisaunder was sore awhaped Þat he was so sone ascaped, And suore he shulde sore abugge, And his hede for þat gilt legge— For al þe golde of Cartage Nolde he take oþere gage. Her eiþer to oþere ost is went, Ful of yre and mautalent. Þe ni?th þai resteþ litel, forsoþe, Bot as men þat ben wroþe. Wel warded þai weren boþe þat ni?th, Al forto spronge þe dayes li?th. Cler and fair is day-springyng, And makeþ many departyng Bituene kni?th and his suetyng. Þe sonne ariseþ and felleþ deveyng, Of nesshe clay and makeþ clyngyng. Many ben jolyf in þe morowenyng And þolen deþ in þe euenyng. Nis in þis werlde non so siker þing, Þe tyme nei?eþ of her wendyng. Alisaunder in þe daweyng Quyk had armed al his gyng— Wiþ mychel ost he is comyng. Þere was trumpyng and tabournyng, Lepyng of stedes and nay?eyng. Many a riche gilt shelde Þat day shoon vpon þe felde, And many banere ygilt of ynde Þat day rateled in þe wynde. Wiþ cryeyng and þretyng wordes Hij metten, wiþ speres ordes. Many dou?tty ?onge kni?th Þat ilk day assayed his mi?th; Vche on oþere, wiþ grete mayn, Tobrusten her launces in þe playn. Summe hadden perced þe þarmes Þorou? þe shelde and her armes, Somme þe þrote, summe þe hertes Hadden perced and storuen, certes. After launces, swerdes þai drowe, And many kni?ttes oþere slow?e. Many þere weren þat yuel sped, For þai laiden heuedes to wed. Summe armes and hondes loren, And summe legges, wiþ þe sporen. Many kni?th, in litel stounde, Lagh?tte þere dedly wounde. Many kni?th starf þere in þe prees; Many childe was faderles; Many lefdy lees her amoure, And many maiden her gent socoure. Many steden drowen her bridel— Who-so wolde, he mi?th ryde, Wiþouten siluer, wiþouten golde, Whider-wardes so he wolde. On boþe half, in litel stounde, Was many a kni?th yleid to grounde, Ac þe descounfyt and þe damage Fel vpon hem of Cartage. Nicholas ysawe al þis, And made a newe justes, jwys, And slou? of Alisaunder men Moo þan J ?ou telle can. Þoo Alisaundre sei? þis greuaunce, He took on honde a styf launce, And amydward þe place He mette wiþ Nicholas. Hei?e he bare his sharp spere— Þorou? þe shelde he gan hym bere, Ac þe armes weren so stronge Þe spere nolden hij nou?th fonge. Alisaunder þe spere forlete, And drou? his swerd, also skeete. Nicholas he took in þe swere, Þat he leide his heued to hyre, And seide to hym, also skeet, ‘þis Ich þe ?esterday byheet, Þoo þou spytted in my visage.’ Þe oþere slowen wiþ grete rage. Þe spoyle þai token of þe dede, Hors and armes gode at nede. Alisaundre quyk wiþ alle Of Cartage felde þe walle, And slou? doune-ri?th, wiþoute pyte, And took þe spoyle of þe cite, And þe coroune of þe londe, And bare it away jn his honde. Golde, and siluer, alle oþere þinges, Hij trussen to her shippynges. Þe wynde is ri?th good, saun faile— Hij setten mast and halen sayle, And wendeþ toward her londe. Jesus Crist vs sende his sonde. Whiles Alisaundre was in medleye, And slou? folk in oþere cuntreye, Comen folk of Grece and Alisaundre, And on Olympyas leiden sklaundre, And seiden wiþ wrong she was quene, For she hore had ybene; And sworen, and seiden veire Alisaundre was fals ayre. For þis sklaundre þat was so vyle, And also of grete peryle, Kyng Philipp, by al his regioun, Of-sent erle, duk, kni?th, and baroun, Þat juggeden alle hem bitwene Olympyas ne shulde be quene. Ac mi?th she wers, mi?t[h] she bett, Jn a castel she was yshett, And was assigned lyueresoun Skarslich and nou?th a foysoun. Þe kyng dude by his conseile, And sent to Asserye saunz fayle, To Cleopatras, þat riche quene, Þat she shulde his spouse bene. Þe messagers weren gent barouns; Þe lefdy leued her rounes, And granted by conseilyng To ben yspoused to Philippe þe kyng. Þe day was sette, wiþouten essoyne— Þe þrittenþe day at Macedoyne. Þoo þis message was hom ycome, Þere was many a bliþe gome. Of olyue and of muge-floures Weren ystrewed halle and boures. Wiþ samytes and baudekyns Weren curtyned þe gardyns. Alle þe jnnes of þe toun Hadden litel foysoun Þat day þat com Cleopatras, So mychel poeple wiþ hir was. She rood on a mule white so mylk; Her herneys was gold-beten sylk. Þe prince hire led of Candas, And of Sydoyne Sir Jonathas. Ten þousande barons hir comen myde, And to chirche wiþ hire ryde. Yspoused she is and set on deys. Nov gynneþ gest of gret nobleys. At þe fest was harpyng, And pipyng and tabournyng, And sitollyng and trumpyng, Knijf-pleyeyng and syngyng, Carolyng and turneieyng, And wrestlyng and skirmyng. Þe gamen ne geþ nou?th al by lyne— Þere summe lei?eþ and summe whyne. Olympyas she hereþ þis, Jn þe toure whare she shet is. She wepeþ and syngeþ ‘Weilaway!’ Þat she euere abode þat day. She clepeþ hire self often wrecche; She biddes deþ þat he hire fecche, And seide, ‘Son, O Alisaundre! Jch abygge of þee þe sklaunder. Sore of þinkeþ me þis cas Þat þou fi?ttes wiþ Nicholas. Haddestou leued in þis londe, Ne had Ich þoled swiche shonde.’ Mi?th she haue yfounde a knijf, She had yspilt sone her lijf. ‘Allas’, she seide, ‘J nere aqueld! For men me clepeþ quene afeld. Ne may Ich neuer of honour ?elp, Alisaunder, bot þou me help.’ Þus she grad ‘Weilaway!’ Tyl þe tyme of hei?e mydday. At none riseþ hire worschipes: Aryued ben hire sones shippes. He noot nou?th of þis bridale, Ne noman telleþ hym þere-of tale. He greiþes hym in riche weden, And dooþ drawen a-londe his steden. He lepeþ vp myd ydone On a stede of Nerebone. He dassheþ forþ vpon þe londe, Þe riche coroune on his honde Of Nicholas þat he wan. Biside hym rideþ many a gentil-man. To þe paleys he comeþ ryde, And fyndeþ þis feste and al þis pride. Forþ gooþ Alisaundre, saunz fable, Ri?th vnto þe hei?e table, And þe coroune, wiþ golde biweued, He setteþ on his fader heued. His fader praiseþ his prowesse, Of þe coroune and þe richesse. Alisaundre gynneþ aboute seen, And seeþ corouned a straunge quen, And he ne sei? nower Olympias, Þat his owen moder was. Jn herte he gynneþ fecche mood, And lokeþ as he were wood, And seide, ‘Fader, whan my moder is q[ue]ne, Þou shalt at hir bridale bene.’ He wassheþ and sitteþ at þe fest; Men hym serueþ of þe best. A duk þere was, hoten Lesyas; To Alisaundre he com gode pas, And ramproned hym of Olympias. Alisaundre so anoyed was Ouer þe table he gan stoupe, And smoot Lesyas wiþ þe coupe Þat he fel doun in þe flette— His ei?en out of his heued shette. Hym to awreke kyng Philippe Ouer þe table gan to skippe, Ac he lau?tte sone swiche qued He was jn borne for nei? ded. Alisaundres folk com flynge, Fyue hundred vpon a rynge. Þe tables weren ouerþrowen, And many kni?ttes wel sone yslawen. Alisaundre name Cleopatras, And out hire harshede, grete pas, And sette hire quyk vpon a mule, And droof hire out of toun foule. Vilenye gret to hire was shape, Bot þoo þat mi?tten her deþ scape. Cleopatras flei? to hire londe, Wiþ mychel shame and mychel shonde. Alisaundre had þat best Þat was purueied to þat fest— Golde, and siluer, and riche cloþe (Þai þat it loren weren wroþe!). Þus it fareþ at fest wiþ vnwise: After mete cuntek ariseþ. Wel is þe moder þat may forþ fede Childe þat helpeþ hire at nede. Olympias is now awroke, Ac ?ut she is in walle biloke, And noot here-of noþing, Of Alisaundres contekyng. Ac Alisaundre sone vnderstant Hou al þis contek is ywant. Jt nys non nede here to duelle, Ne longe tales here to telle. His fader he sett a raysoun; He is biknowe he is his son, And þat he is ri?th heir After hym to regne, veir. Al he makeþ his dames pes, And al sklaunder he makeþ les. To hir he haþ þe waye ynome. Joyeful is she of his come. She wolde hym telle al her ylle, And he hire hoteþ helden stille: She shulde hire pleynt do to noþe, For he wyst wel þe soþe. Quyk he led hire hom; Hym folowed many kni?th and grom. Þere was [a]gonne newe fest, And of glev-men many gest. Kyng Philippe was a male eys. Alisaundre helde þe deys; He dude seruen Olympias Jn golde, in siluer, in brus, in glas. So riche fest no man ne say So Alisaunder held þat day. Kyng Philippe þere-myd was, And acorded wiþ Olympias. Also þai seten at þis gestenyng, Comen messages to Philippe þe kyng. Mery swiþe it is in halle Whan þat berdes waweþ alle. Messagers comeþ flynge Jn to þe halle tofore þe kynge, From a cite, on hors and fote, Þat was Mantona yhote. Þai seiden hym, at on word, Þai nolden hym more to lorde, For hem defenden he ne mi?th. Her kni?ttes and her dukes wi?th Nolden more of hym helde. Þe kynges veynes wexen chelde, And nyst what he done mi?th, Ac by conseil of his kni?ttes He takeþ Alisaunder þis disray, Forto amende it ?if he may. Alisaunder it haueþ afonge, Wharfore at table hym þinkeþ longe. After mete, demeyntenaunt, To mouþe he sett his olyfaunt; He bloweþ smert and loude sounes. Kni?ttes hem armen in court and tounes— Hij vnderstonden þat it be nede. Þere comeþ to hym armed on stede Ten þousande, al prest and ?are Jn to bataile forto fare, And fiftene þousandes o[n] ladden Þat swerdes and boklers boþe hadden, And axes, speres, forkes, and slynges, And alle stalworþe gadelynges. Alisaundre was swiftest and ?ep, And on Bulcyfal lepe, And touched hym myd þe spore, And he sprong out at þe halle-dore. Ne shulde foule, gret ne smal, Haue ysiwed Bulcyfal. He brou?th al to wille a?en, And hardyed alle his men. He touched his horne and forþ ride; Many man hym went mide. Her waye so ri?th hij nome Þat þai to þe cite come. Her drawebrigge hij drowen whate, And shetten fast her gate. Alisaunder hem asailed fast, And wiþ mangenels hem gan gast. Þai wiþinne to þe walles stowe, And defended hem wiþ bowe, Wiþ arblastes, and wiþ stones— Hij slow?en men and breken bones. Wiþ hote water and oþere engyne Hij defended hem wiþinne. Ac Alisaundre quyk hete his hynen Vnder her walles forto mynen, Wiþ stronge gynnes and deþ werres Þerewhiles þe myners. Ac by strengþe ne by gynne Ne may he þem þat day wynne, Ne þat oþere, ne þat þrid, Ne þe fierþe he ne sped. Ac þoo Alisaunder sei? þis, He forstopped her wayes, jwys, Þat þere ne mi?th [nou?th] to her fode Entren jn, for none gode, Ne kni?th, ne sweyn, ne her stren None wayes ne mi?tten flen. Þe folk and þe pouerayle Weren enfamyned, saunfaile, And on þe richer alday gradden. Þe riche of hem reuþe hadden, And seiden hij hadden sikerlich Leuer to steruen orpedlich Þan to þolen suiche woo and sorou?en, And token conseil on þe morowen Chaumpe bataile to wenden to. Riche and pouer alle wolden so. Ofte springeþ þe bri?th morowe, Many to blisse, many to sorowe. Qued it is mychel to borowe, And wers it is euer to sorowe. Þoo þat connen nou?th ben in payse, Often hij maken hem yuel ataise. Þe kyng of Mantona and his kni?ttes Ben y-armed redy to fi?ttes, Jn breny of steel and riche weden. Hij don swiþe gon her steden. Þe gate is vp, and hij oute riden— Þe stedes rennen wiþ slake bridlen. Wiþ launces hij gynnen togedre flynge, Ac hij founden hard encountrynge. Of kni?ttes þere was stronge metynge, Hard justes, staf brekynge, On boþe half loude crieynge, Kni?ttes þorou?-strike, stedes lesinge. Jn litel while were many yslawe, And ysmyte þorou? wombe and mawe. Alisaundre ful wel ysaye Þat it was a dedly playe. His shille horne he blew þrie, His kni?ttes forto hardye. He sei? þe kyng of þat cite Slen his folk wiþouten pite. He gripeþ in his honde a spere— A?ein þe kyng he gynneþ it bere. He smyteþ hym on þe sheeld ygylt, Þorou?-out þe boord, þorou?-out þe felt. Þorou?-out þe breny crepeþe þe egge, And þorou? þe herte, and þorou? þe rigge. Þe spere bresteþ, þe kyng is falle; Hise kni?ttes fleen wel swiþe alle. Þat folk is sleyn wiþoute pyte, And forbrent is þat cite. Alisaundre a?ein hym di?ttes, Bliþe in herte, and alle his kni?ttes. Þoo kyng Philippe it vnderstood, Wel bliþe was his herte-blood. [Men tellen in olde mone Þe qued com[e]þ nowher al one.] Now ?ee shullen vnderstonde Comeþ messagers of straunge londe, And asken of Philippe trovage, Of wood, and water, and londe, by vsage. Philippe sore so was ennoyede, Ac Alisaundre hem haueþ seide: ‘Lordynges, forsoþe, Ich ?ou telle, He þat made heuene and helle Afterward made man, Oure former fader, hete Adam. To his ofspryng, so þinkeþ me, Alle he made yliche free— Water, and wodes, londes, and pleynes. ?if Darrie haueþ þorou? his meynes Don Philippe, my fader, wrong, Jch am elde ynou? and strong A?eins Darrie hym so to wreke Þat þe werlde shal þere-of speke, And Ich wiþclepe and wiþstonde Þe trowage of Grece londe. Þerwhiles J may hors bistride, Ne shal he neuer non abide.’ Þoo bispaken þe messageres, And alle her men of one cheres: ‘Alisaunder,’ hij seiden, ‘jwys, Þou shalt þee holden for vnwijs, ?if þou, þorou? folye oiþer rage, Wiþholdest Darryes trowage. A grete storme is falle by a reyn— Sone wil he daunten þine meyn. Somme þere dar Darrye manace, Ac nou?th ysen hym in any place. We reden þou lete þi mautalent, And sende Darrye of Grece rent.’ Kyng Alisaunder, so lyoun kene, Hoteþ þe messagers out of his ei?ene. Quyk hij deliuereþ Macedoyne, And passeþ by Tyre and by Sydoyne, Þere woned whilom Kyng Appolloyne, Al forto hij comen to Babyloyne, And tolden Kyng Darrie of Alisaunder ?engþe, His boost, his pride, his hardynesse, his strengþe. Kyng Darrye swore by his lay He shulde abygge ?ut sumday. [A]lisaunder is in his londe, And haþ sone a newe sonde From a cite in þe est: Hij nylleþ don Philippes hest. Þider he wendeþ wiþ grete preesse, Þe sturdy cite to a-dresse. Þerwhiles now yhereþ a caas. A riche baroun in Grece was (His name was yhote Pausanias) Þat loued mychel Olympyas. So he ?ede and so he sent, Wiþ writtes and wiþ riche present, Þat he dude in bed stille By þe lefdy al his wille, And bitwene hem hadden yspeke Of Kyng Philippe to ben awreke. Wommans hert is wiþ þe werst— She wil be wroken oiþer to-brest. By her boþer compasement, Þe kyng is wounded, verreyment, Dedly wounded þorou? þe nape, Þat he ne mi?th þe deþ askape. Alisaunder from his disray Was comen hom þat ilk day, And herd of þis noise and cry. To þe palays he com on hy?; Fonde he stonde Pausanias By þe quene dame Olympias. A brode gauelok he lete ride, And smoot hym þorou?-out boþe syde. To Kyng Philippe he ledd hym þoo, Þat [his] heued cleued a-twoo. He þonked Kyng Alisaundre þerof, certe, And starf alswiþe, wiþouten smerte. Philippe is ded—as kyng of myche werþe Richely is he ybrou?th on erþe. From þe deþ he ne mi?th flen, Siþen þe quene awroken wolde ben, And he þat þe traisoun dede Was forehakked in þat stede. Kyng Philippe haþ al þat ri?th Þat man may to kyng di?th. Kyng Alisaunder dooþ of-sende Alle his dukes and barouns hende— Erles, kni?ttes, and oþere wise, Þat of hym holdeþ in to Frise, Of vche cite þe burgeys On whom was name of nobleys, And ?if any seide noo, Þe name he wolde wyte of þoo. His messageres, wiþouten doute, Rideþ and gooþ her-aboute. Þe messagers, whan hij comeþ a?an, Hem foloweþ many gentil-man, Boþe on palfrey and on stede, And clerkes eek, in riche wede. Vnto Corinthe alle hij comen, Boþe þe lorde and ek his gromen. Þere bare Alisaunder coroune, And took feute of vche toune, Of duk, erle, kni?th, burgeys, baroun, Þat longed vnto his coroun. Þere he made many kni?th Þat was hardy, stronge, and wi?th, And ?af vche lordyng gret honoure, And parted wiþ hem his fader tresoure. Fest he made of nobleye— Was neuere non swiche yseye. After mete, onon-ri?ttes, He dooþ noumbre his gode kni?ttes, And fyndeþ fiftene þousande and hundred seuen, Alle of Grece yborne, by heuene, And seuen and tuenty hundreþ sawders, Stronge in felde, vpon destrers, And also ei?tte and fourty þousende And fyue hundreþ of fotemen he fande. Þat was, vnder al, sexty þousande and seuen hundre. Ac ?ut me þinkeþ wel grete wondre Þat he mi?th, wiþ so fewe, Al þe werlde hym vnder-þewe, And þat he so durst and vnderstood, More awondreþ al my blood. Ac sooþ it is, cayser ne kyng Ne may a?eins Goddes helpyng. To batail ward he gynneþ hym ?arke. Þe somers beeþ trussed, þe shippes þai carke. His folk, ful of orpedschippe, Swiþe lepeþ in to þe shippe. Þe maryneres crieþ and taleþ— Ancres in to shippe þai haleþ. Hij drawen sayl to top of mast, And in to Trace seyleþ on hast. Þere quyk falleþ to his honde Alle þe cites of þe londe, Erles, kni?ttes, and barouns, Of al Trace regiouns. Þere he sette his owen assises, And made baillifs and justises, And took hem fyue þousande kni?ttes, And seiled þennes, onon-ri?ttes. Þe þrid day, wiþouten gyle, He aryued at Cesile, Þere he had þou?th to done. Ac he it aliþed sone, Boþe wiþ queyntise and wiþ vigoure. H[e] wan of þat þe honoure, And many noble batailloure Þat hym duden siþen socoure. Jn þ[e] londe he sette his law?es; An soiour of fewe dawes, His ost he cressed wiþ seuen þousynde Of noble kni?ttes, so J fynde, And went hym in to Lumbardye. Helpe vs alle now Seint Marie. At Venyse comeþ vp Alisaundre. Pays men bleu and hyd sklaunder. His lettres he sent, wiþouten assoyne, Onon jn to Grace Boloyne, Jn to Paduie, jn to Moyoun, And jn to Parme, þat riche toun, Jn to Pauye, jn to [C]remun, And to Plesaunce, of grete renoun; Jn to Nouarre and jn to Dole, Jn to Verseus, a cite of scole, And jn to Melane, þat þe maistrie Bereþ ouere al Lumbardye. Her conseil was sone ynome— To wenden to þat riche gome, And holden of hym al her londe. Þe keyes hij token in his honde Of her cites, of her honoure, And maden hym her liege seignoure. He had of hem al þat he wolde— Steden, armes, siluer, and golde, And many stronge werreyoure Þat siþen hym dude grete honoure. Þennes he sent jn to Tusk, jn Tuskan, And þennes hym com many a man, And from Florence, and from Shene, Many kni?th wiþ armes clene. From Curtyne and from Rauenne Hym com kni?ttes and mychel wynne. From Curtynan and from Asise Hym com kni?ttes of grete prise. From Gobyn and from Orbenete, From Viterbe and from Arethe, Hym com richesse and grete sonde, And fele kni?ttes to his honde. Atte last his lettres come Jn to þe cite of grete Rome. Þe riche poeple and þe senas Spaken to-gedres of þis cas. Jch ?ou sigge, verrayment, Hij s[en]tten by on assent A riche coroune of rede golde, For he her lorde ben sholde, And two þousande of noble kni?ttes Þat in bataile weren wi?ttes (Marcus he hete þat hem ladd— Alisaunder none better hadd) And fourty þousande mark yshade, Forto ben of his frenderade. Þe Romeynes hym sendeþ þis prise, And gretyng, and ‘redy to his seruise’. He greteþ þe Romaynes wiþ chere bliþe, And wendeþ of londe, also swiþe; Nille he more hij ben anoyed, Ne of his grete ost destroyed. Quyk he shippes jn to Libye Wiþ al his faire chyualrye, And in þat grete regioun Nas castel, cite, ne toun Þat nam bi loue oiþer mi?tte Lesse þan jn fourtene ni?tte. Siþen he passed stille, j-wys, A water þat comeþ from Paradys. Barouns and kni?ttes alle of þat londe ?olden hem onon vnder his honde, Wiþouten bataile, wiþouten dent, Þat he wan al, verreyment— Her au?tte and her chyualrye Hij ?olden to his seignourye. Now haþ Alisaundre so myche gynge Þat non it noot bot heuene-kynge. Shippes he dooþ make snelle— Many hundreþ, Ich ?ou telle. He soiourneþ and his folk wiþ hym Jn a cite þat is yhote Tripolyn. A temple was in þe markat Of T[e]ruagaunt and Balat. On ymage was þere-inne, Y?oten al of golde fyne. Sonne, and mone, and sterren seuene, Was þere-inne purtraied, and heuene. Þe kyng ofsent, Ich vnderstonde, Þan a bisschoppe of þe londe, And asked hym in whas honoure Was ymade þat figure. Þe bisshoppe wep for herte ermyng, And þus he seide to þe kyng: ‘Þere was sumtyme ouer vs A kyng þat hi?th Neptanabus, Curteys in halle, in werre wi?th. He ne ?af nou?th of no fi?th— Kyng non of none londe Jn bataile mi?th hym wiþstonde. Þis ymage he made here Jn þe honoure of Jubiter. Sonne and mone þat beeþ in heuene, And þe planetes, alle seuene, And þe cours of þe sterren, By hem he iugged alle his werren. Whan any kyng hym wolde assaile, He couþe þerby seen, saunfaile, And by his charme mychel wonder— Hou he shulde hem brynge vnder. And atte last fel a cas, Of fele kynges hated he was, And quyk on vche half þai gunne hym assaile. He loked in his art, saunfayle, And sei? he shulde ben ouercome. By ni?th fledd þat gentyl gome— Noman ne couþe, for no þing, Siþen here of hym tiþing.’ Kyng Alisaunder teres gan stoppe, And seide vnto þe bisshoppe: ‘Bisshoppe,’ he seide, ‘þere is a sklaunder Yleide on me, Kyng Alisaunder, Þat J shulde ben bi?eten amys. Telle me who my fader is, Pryuely bituene þee and me— Þi trauaile shal J quyte þee.’ Þe bisshop graunted þe kynges talent, And dude hym on a vestement, And made on Sarsynes wyse To Jubiter sacrifise; And after longe sacrifyeyng, He com and seide to þe kyng Stillich, bitwene his lyppe, Þat his fader hi?th kyng Philippe. Kyng Alisaunder vpon hym lou?, And in herte was bliþe ynou? Þoo alþerfirst he vnderstood Þat he was ri?th of kynges blood. He ?af þe bisshoppe, to gode hans, Riche bei?es, besauntz, and pans, Cloþes, a?ttes, wiþouten ende. Now agynneþ gestes hende. Noyse is gret wiþ tabour and pype, Damoysels playen wiþ peren ripe. Ribaudes festeþ also wiþ tripe; Þe gestour wil oft his mouþe wype. Alisaunder is a noble man— His ost telle no wi?th ne can. Hij shippen alle in shippes gode; Þe cee ferd also a wode. Kynges, princes, of fele londes, Quyk hem ?olden to his hondes. Hij brou?tten hym jewels wiþ riche golde, And hem to his wille ?olde, So þat hij comen to þe cite of Tyre, Þe noblest cite of þat empyre. Alisaundre hij despisen, His messagers and his justisen. Gates hij shetteþ and barbecane— Hij manneþ hem wel, wiþouten wane. Vp þai setten her magnels, And arblastes, wiþ querels, And sendeþ Alisaunder to seye He goo to Macedoyne and pleye— His berde shal hore, his folk steru[e] Ar any man of Tyre hym serue. Whan þis to Alisaunder was yseide, Out of wytt he warþe anoyede. He hete quyk, wiþoute pyte, His men assaile þat cite. Dieu mercy! to mychel harme Many kni?th þere gan hym arme. Þere men mi?tten quyk yseen Many hors wiþ trappe wryen, And kni?ttes beren baneres and shelde; Of hem shoon þe brode felde. Þoo þat þai founden wiþouten þe toun Wiþ sharp swerd hij leiden adoun. Þe fote-men and þai on hors Trauaileden stronge her cors Wiþ launceynge and wiþ ridyng, Wiþ þraweynge and wiþ mynyng, Wiþ gredyng and wiþ þretyng, And wilde-fire slyngyng. Michel hij duden her meyn Þe walles to fellen on þe pleyn, Ac þe citezeines weren so wi?th, And ynou? couþen of fi?th— Wiþ peises, stones, and gauelok, Her fon hij gynnen fast to knok. Wiþ hoot water and boyled metal Hij defenden her wal; Wiþ longe billes ymade for þe nones Hij to-keruen her bones. Þere layen in litel stounde Þat staruen wiþ ded[ly] wounde. Of summe was þe brayn out squatt, Al vnder þe yrnen hatt. Summe wiþ peys was to-frussht, Summe wiþ gauelok to deþ lussht— Þere was sone in þat prees Many childe faderles. Þe slau?tte fel wiþouten þe wal On Alisaunders folk nei? al. Þoo Alisaunder sei? þis, A-rovme he drou? quyk, jwys, And sett a ruet to his mouþe. To alle his folk he was couþe— Alle hij leten þe assailyng, And abouten hym comen flyngyng. He bad hem make pauyloun Al abouten þat riche toun, And hem from þe assautt drawe, Where many of hise weren yslawe. So þai deden, and maden tente, Al abouten, riche and gente, And afterward, þoo it was ni?th, Hij founden sleyn of her kni?th Ten hundreþ and sumdele moo. For hem was made wel mychel woo, For hij weren kni?ttes of grete werþe; Þai were faire brou?th on erþe. Alisaunder hem solaced þus: ‘Lordynges, ne beeþ nou?th anguisshous, Þei? ?ee habbeþ ?oure frendes ylore. Lorde and frende Ich wil be þerfore. Men mote boþe wynne and lese— Chaunce ne lete[þ] noman chese. Ar longe, hij mowen ben syker, Jch shal hem ?elden wel þis byker.’ Now resteþ Alisaunder jn þis siggyng— Yhereþ now al oþer þing. Herd ?ee habbeþ, Ich wil reherce, Hou þe messagers comen from Perce For trowage and Philippe ennoyed— Hou Alisaunder it hem wiþseide. Now atte first þe messagers Beeþ ycome to her empirers. Hij saluen Darrye her lorde, And siggen hym þis worde: ‘Lorde, we weren in þi message Jn Grece after trewage, Ac it is wiþseid in al þing, Of a ?onge kni?th þat þinkeþ be kyng. Worþes þee non while he may lyue— Oiþer þou most it al for?yue, Oiþer, he þee sent to sigge, Dereynen it wiþ swerdes egge.’ Darrie startleþ for þise tydynges, And makeþ anguisshous þretynges. He takeþ wiþ hym many a duk Þat bileueþ on Belsabuk, And gooþ myd hym to on orchard And parlement hij haldeþ hard. Jch ?ou telle, litel, jwys, Of Alisaunder he heldeþ prys, And [by] hire aldre radd and want A lettre [to] hym is ysant, By riche dukes þrittene. Bou? hi baren of olyue grene. Þe duk þere was of Ermynye, Of Esclaueyne, and of Sulye, Of Pyncenarde, and of Mede. Þoo of Nynyue, good at nede, Þe duk of Japhes and Taberye, Þe duk of Fryse, and of Hungrye, Þe duk of Moreb, and Calebyne, And þe duk of Palestyne; Þai comen alle, honde in honde, Toforne Alisaundre in Tyre londe, Vche wiþ bou? of olyue, Þat was tokne of pays and of l[o]ue, And token hym þat Darrye hym sent— Þre þinges to present: A scourge and a toppe of nobleys, And ful of golde an haum[u]deys, And a lettre, par amoure, Of whiche swiche was þe tenure: ‘Darrye, kyng of alle kynges, Þe godes þat haueþ to eldringes, For his nexte by-syb cosyn Beeþ Jubiter and Appolyn, Gouernoures of lewed and lered Þat beeþ in þis middellerd, Sendeþ gretyng wiþouten amoure To a ?onge fals robboure. Alisaunder, þou conion wood, Jn þe spilleþ þi faye blood! Þou hast wiþholde my trowage, And ydon me more outrage— Brent myne tounes, myne men yslawe. Þou art worþi to ben ydrawe. Nere-þe-lees, þou canst no good; Jch wyte it al þi ?onge blood. Þere-fore Ich habbe þee ysent A top and scourge to present, And wiþ golde a litel punge, For þou hast ?eres ?onge. Wende þou hom þerewiþ and pleye, Jch þee rede, ?onge boye! Oiþer Ich þee shal doo bete and dynge Wiþ a fewe gadelynge, And afterwardes quyk þee flen, And alle þi folk wiþ sorou? slen. Wenestou to be my pere? Nay, jwys, wrecche pautenere! Jch haue moo kni?ttes to werren Þan ben in þe walken sterren, And moo men wiþ stronge bones Þan ben jn þe cee grauel-stones. Flei?e now swiþe, þat þou ne be yfounde, Oiþer men þee shulle dryue wiþ hounde.’ Þis was þe wrytt þad Darrye sent To Alisaunder to present, Ac of Alisaunder ?ee shullen here Hou he it tourned in oþere manere. Alisaunder wel wele seeþ Þat his kni?ttes dismaied beeþ. He lei?eþ and swereþ by þe sonne Mede and Perce he haþ ywonne, ‘Forþi þis scourge shal signifye Þat J shal wynne þe maistrye Of Darrye, and also chaste Hym and hise, þe mo[st]e and þe laste. Þe top þat is rounde aboute Signifieþ also, saunz doute, Þat þe werlde þat rounde is Shal be myne also, j-wys. And bitokneþ by þe punge Þat Ich shal of elde and ?onge Of þis midlerde tol afonge. Siggeþ Darrye þis ilk songe, And þat Ich nylle myd hym acorde, Bot wiþ swerd and speres oorde.’ Þise messageres hereþ þis tale, And wendeþ hom, by doune and dale. Alisaunder alle hise nedes A?eins Tyre swiþe spedes. Þe mysdoers he dooþ ben yslawe, And to þe oþere he ?iueþ law?e (?if law?e were of þe grete lordynges Js Darrye her lorde and kyng). Alisaunder sett þere his baillyf. To Darrie ward he went blijf, Ac he was letted by þe waye, At many bataile, J ?ou saye. Darrye sitteþ at mete, þe riche kyng, And holdeþ riche gestenyng, Of dukes, erles, and ammyraile, And of soudeyns also, saun fayle. Þise messageres—alistneþ alle!— Honde in honde comeþ in to halle. Hij greten Darrye þe hei?e kyng, And telleþ hym stronge tiþing: ‘Sir,’ hij seiden, ‘it is no fals sclaunder Þat gooþ by londe of Alisaunder. Jt is an hardy flumbarlyng, Wijs and war, in al þing. He haþ wonne Egipte and Libye, Cesile, Rome, and Lumbardy, Calabre, Poyle, al to Burgoyne, Cipres also and Esclauoyne. Hym ne may cuntre wiþstonde Þat he wil do to his honde. By ?oure skourge he seide on hast Þat he ?ou shulde adaunte and chast. By þe top and by þe purs ?ut he seide mychel wers— Þat he shulde of þe werlde and þee Taken tol and maister bee. Tyre is fallen vnder his honde; Comen he is jn to þi londe— Fyre and swerd is his acorde. We nabbeþ ygabbed neuere a worde.’ Darrie from hym þe table shett, Þat it wendeþ in þe flett. He þroweþ legges ouere oþer, And makeþ þretynges, ful a foþer, And clepeþ his chauncelere, And hoteþ hym sende fer and nere To hise justises lettres hard, And hij þe contreies t[a]ken ferd, To-frusshe þat gadelyng and to-bete, And non of hem on lyue ne lete. Þise lettres to his justises comen, Ac þai hym senten oþere domen— Þat Alisaunder had wiþ his hand Nere ywonne al þat lande. Men dreden hym, on vche half, So chalf þe bere and shep þe wolf. Vche man hadd grete howe Forto loke þat was his owe. To cite, castel, and to toure, Vche man drou? to socoure, And bot he dude by oþere conseyle Alisaunder was at his tayle. Þat londe was lorne, saunz dotaunce, Euermore wiþ þappurtenaunce. Whan Darrie al þis vnderstood, He was nei? of wytt wood. He sent a lettre, wiþoute lettyng, To Alisaunder and gretyng, Þat he shulde come as amy, And don hym in his mercy, Amende his trespas, by juggement— Good shulde ben þacordement. Alisaundre sent wiþ-segge Orde of spere and swerdes egge Shulden at her accordyng ben, And non oþer, kyng ne quen, And hoteþ þe duk and his kni?ttes Tournen to Darrye, onon-ri?ttes. Mery it is in June and hoot firmament; Fair is þe karole of maydens gent, Boþe in halle and ek in tente. Jn justes and fi?ttes nys oþere rente Bot bones knusshed and hard dent. Ac þat is al Alisaundres entent. Quy[k] he dooþ his bemen blowe, An hundreþ vpon a rowe. His chymbe-bellen he dooþ rynge, And dooþ dasshe grete tabourynge. Ouer al þe ost he dooþ crye Þat hij wendeþ alle to Arabye, And setten fyre and wilde-bronde Quyk on kyng Darryes londe, Brenne castel and brenne cite, And brenne doune-ri?th, wiþouten pite. Sone was don þe kynges heste. Hij charged many a selcouþe beeste Of olifauntz, and ek camayles, Wiþ armure and ek vitayles, Longe cartes wiþ pauylounes, Hors and oxen wiþ venisounes, Assen and mulen wiþ her stouers; Þe kni?ttes riden on destrers, Alle y-armed swiþe wel, Wiþ bryny and launce and swerd of stel. Many shelde þere was shynende, And many banere ratelynde, Many stede loude nay?ende, And to Arabye lepynde. Þe folk of Arabye londe Habbeþ his comyng vnderstonde, And haueþ ymade dyche and walles, And schette þe gates of þe cites alle. Wiþ þe power of vche contreye Þat hij couþen til hem purueye, To Alisaunder hij ?iuen byker, And many stronge bataille, siker. Ac helpen nou?th it ne mi?th, For Alisaunder and alle his kni?ttes Hem to pieces þai gonne talle, So bocher þat hog vpon his stalle. Dukes, princes, barouns, kni?ttes, Þat hem wiþstonden myd to fi?ttes, Hij weren to-frussht from foot to croun, So þe hynde is of þe lyoun, And so þe tygre þat fynt ystole Her whelpes oiþer forhole— Wiþ mouþ she brenneþ beest and man, Bot she keuer hem sone a?an. Alle hij slen doune-ri?th wiþ swerde, Bot hem þat comen to acorde, And ?elden hym castel and cite— Hem he took in to pyte, And ouer hem sette gode warde. Þe oþere he slou? on deþ hard, Wiþ fyre brennyng and wiþ swerd, Wiþ axe, wiþ mace, wiþ speres orde. Sexty cites in þat quarter He forbrent wiþ wylde-fyre, And many hundreþ þousande weren yspild, Kni?th, sweyn, burgeys, lefdy, and child. Þe dukes of þe londe wiþ howe To Kyng Darrye beeþ yflowe, And makeþ pleynt and makeþ cry On Alisaunder her enemy— Telleþ þe slau?tte and þe brennyng, And biddeþ hym smertly helpyng, And of-sendeþ quyk socour hende, Al in to þe werldes ende. Fyue hundreþ kni?ttes, saun faile, He haþ redy to bataile. Who so wil now ?iuen lyst, Here bigynneþ þe romaunce best. Darrie þe soudan, maister of alle kyng, Js strongelich anoyed of selcouþ tiþing. He is yshet in a verger, And wiþ hym many bolde cayser, Alle of Jnde in to Mount Taryn And of Affrike to þe cite Daryn. Þere was many a Sarsyn And longe-berded Barbaryn; Bitwene Tygre and Eufraten Seten alle þise heþen men. Þere was Jonas of Sklaueyne, And Joachym, duk of Coloyne, And Antiphilus of Barbarye, And Joachym of Tabarye, [Of] Capadoce and Saturnyn, And of Saba þe duk Mauryn (He was of Kaymes kynrede— His men ne couþen speke ne grede, Bot als houndes grenne and berken, So vs siggen þise clerken). An hundreþ þousande conseilers Wiþ Darrie weren in þat vergers. Vp he dresseþ heued and swire, And gynneþ speke on þis manere: ‘Ore sa tost! Salome my cosyn, And A[rc]hela[u], of Jopes lyn, And of Calden þe duk Tyryne, ?ee seeþ my woo, ?ee seeþ my pyne— Takeþ fourty þousande kni?ttes, And wel ?ou armeþ onon-ri?ttes, And wendeþ toforne ost myne Al to þe castel of Baryne, And ?if ?ee meteþ þat robboure, ?iueþ hym mysauentoure. Cutteþ his heued his body fro, And mychel honoure J shal ?ou do. Beeþ hardy and manly dooþ, For we ?ou siweþ after, for sooþ.’ Salome and hise felawes Þis heste token wel yfawes. Þe stedes þai gunne by mane grope, And lopen on sadel wiþouten stirope. Fourty þousande heþen kni?tten Wiþ her lorde to werre hem di?tten. Hij weren þe best of þe disray Þat he maden þat ilk day. Þere was many gounfanoun Of gylt sendel and cyclatoun; Many faire heþen lefdy Þere last sei?en her amy. Hij wenten quyk; hem þou?tten longe— Þai gonnen many jolyf songe. And euere þai seiden as þai gonne ride, Kyng Alisaunder ne durst hem abide; For ?if he mi?th ben yfounde, Þai wolden hym brynge to Darry ybounde. Þus þai wenten ouer londe, Til þai comen to one stronde Jn a mede, vnder a doune. Þere þai telden her pauyloune, Þat ni?th and hem resteþ þare, Mid warde þat was good and war. Amorowe, whan þe day was cler, Salome lep on his destrer, Y-armed and gird wiþ stelen bronde, And dassht hym quyk ouer þe stronde, And rideþ swiþe so foule may flen, Alisaundres ost al forto seen. He haþ perceyued by his si?th Þat he ne haþ a?ein hym mi?th. He rideþ a?ein to Darry þe kyng, And telleþ hym newe tydyng: ‘Sir,’ he seide, ‘Alisaundre þi foo, Fel so lyoun, wilde so roo, Liggeþ now wiþ swiche preye Þat he wri?eþ al þe contreye. Swiche hym þreteneþ ne durren hym seen— By oþere rade ?ee moten been. Sendeþ Ymagu [b]y ?oure standard, And Airchillaus in þe first ward.’ Salome was a faire kni?th, Fair in chaumber, stronge in fi?th. His heued was crul and ?elu? þe her, Croune þere-onne, and whyt his swer, Platte feet and longe honde— Nas fairer body in a londe. Darrie was last comynde, Wiþ fyue hundreþ þousynde. Of Capadoce Archillaus Was a kyng ful orgoillous— Tuenty þousande of þat londe He had of kni?ttes to his honde. Þise comen tofore Darrye, And seiden: ‘Sir, þee þar nou?th carye! Of Alisaunder we shullen þee wreke Þat þe werlde shal þere-of speke. We willeþ hym nyme and fast bynde Boþe his honden his rigge byhynde, And ?elden hym þee al to þi wille: Alle his folk we willeþ spille. ?iue me, sir, þe first trauaile— His owen body Ich wil assaile, And do þine ne[ve]we conseilynge, Þine hornes blowe and belles rynge, And lete armen þine Affricanes, Þe Turkeyns and þe Arabians, And take þi standarde to Amalgu, And al þin ost do ordeyne now. Fourty þousande al astore Of olyfauntz lete gon a-fore, Vpe vche olifaunt a castel; Þere-inne doo tuelue kni?ttes armed wel. Hij shullen helde þe skirmyng A?eins Alisaunder þe kyng.’ Darrie was ful wel ypayed Of þat Archillaus had seid. Þe gloue he ?iueþ hem bitwene, Kyng Alisaunder forto slene. Archelaus þere-of ?af graunt, Ac he braak þat couenaunt. Darries folk was gon a[l] or[d]eyn[ed] And ypaueillound in a pleyn. Ouer a water passed hij beeþ; Aiþer ost to oþer seeþ. Kyng Darrye and Salome Habbeþ ypreched her meynee Wel to fi?tth, wel to stonde, Her foon to dryuen out of londe, And warde setteþ forto a-morowe. Jesus shilde vs alle from sorowe! Listneþ now and leteþ gale, For now ariseþ riche tale. In tyme of Maij hoot is in boure. D[iuer]s in mede spryngeþ suete floure, And þe lefdy þe kni?th honureþ. Trewe herte in loue dureþ. At gode nede coward byhynde coureþ; At large ?ift þe hungry loureþ. Gentyl-man his lemman dooþ honoure Jn burgh, in cite, in castel, in toure. Darrie þe kyng and Salome Habbeþ ydi?th her meignee. Þe olifauntz tofore hij di?tteþ, Als erly as þe sonne hym li?tteþ. Fourty þousande castels þere waren Þat twelue oiþer sextene kny?tes baren. Þise shulden wiþstonde hard, And sauen al þe forme ward. Archelaus after hem cam, Þat of Darrie on honde nam Alisaunder hym ded to ?elde, Wiþ tuenty þousande bri?th shelde. Of Affryk þe kyng Tauryn Also fele brou?th wiþ hym. Antiphilus was nexte, of Jnde, And had also tuenty þousynde. Saturnus of Barbarye Led after twenty þousande hardye. Jonas brou?th after of Cartage Twenty þousande kni?ttes sauage. Mauryne brou?th after of hounde londe Twenty þousande, of felle honde. Negusar, prince of Nynyuen, Þritty þousande led after and ten. Oxeatre, Darries odam, After þise ostes cam— Fifty þousande he ledd of kni?th, Jn bataile stronge and wi?th. Darrie com after, blyue, Wiþ his children and his wyue, And wiþ his syster and his meynage— An hundreþ þousande kni?ttes sauage Þat rideþ in his compaignye, And Salome dude hem gye. Þere was gret nay?eing of stede; Þere was many word of pryde; Þere was many riche wede, Of gold and siluer, white and rede. Alisaunder sytt on a samyt, And plaieþ atte ches in his delyt. Noot he nou?th of þis comyng, Ac a kni?th þere comeþ arnyng, And seiþ: ‘Vp, sir, on hast, on hast! Here comeþ Darrie wiþ al his cast. He comeþ wiþ grete here— Jt is wonder þe grounde hym may bere.’ Þe kyng gradde: ‘Armeþ onon!’ To armes hij flou?en euerychon. Many þousande gentil kni?ttes Þere weren y-armed onon-ri?ttes. Tholomeus was his stiward, Þat neuere nas founden coward. Tuelue þousande he led tofore, Gode kni?ttes and dou?tty a-store. Antigonus his marschal was— Nobler kni?th on lyue nas. Þis brou?th, so J fynde, Afterwardes tuelue þousande. Mark of Rome and duk Tyberye (None better nere, J [dar] swerie) Þise tuenty þousande ladde; Nas þere neuere a body badd. Aymes of Archad and Perducas, Noble princes in euery cas, Tuenty þousande ledden, saun faile, None better in bataile. Permayne þe last was, Wiþ Nichan[o]re and Philatas— Þe fader and þe sones tweye. Nere none better in no contreye. Þise brou?tten fourty þousynde, And comen sarrilich byhynde. Alisaunder was wijs and war; Now he was here, now he was þar, And bad hem be hardy and noþing drede— He wolde hem warant in euery nede: ‘Bigynneþ ?oure foomen coile, Al to slei?tte, and nou?th to spoyle. ?ee shullen habben after bataile Al þe bi?ete, saun faile. Leteþ hem passen wiþouten assaile, And siweþ me, after my taile. Nassaileþ none of alle þise ostes, Bot siweþ me þus acostes Al forto Ich habbe Darrie founde, And þan leggeþ on to grounde.’ Þus hij passeden, ost by ost, Wiþouten fi?ttyng, wiþouten bost, Forto þai comen, saunz faile, To þe kynges ost of Tessaile. Þis kyng gan Alisaunder myssigge, And first hym mette wiþ speres egge Þorou? shelde and breny and aketoun— Þe spere tobrast on two trunsoun. Ac Alisaunder hym hitte, certe, Þorou? shelde and breny, and þorou? þe herte. Arethas he het, nou he is ded— Nille he more man wa[i]ten qued. Alisaundres folk gan crye, And seide in grete melodye: ‘Oure kyng haþ þe first afeld! Oure is þe maistrie of þe feld.’ Now rist grete tabour-betyng, Blaweyng of pypes, and ek trumpyng, Stedes lepyng and ek arnyng, Of sharpe speres and aualyng, Of stronge kni?ttes and wi?th metyng; Launces breche and jn crepyng, Kni?ttes fallyng, stedes lesyng, Herte and heuedes þorou?-keruyng, Swerdes draweyng, lymes lesyng, Hard assaylyng and strong defendyng, Stif wiþstondyng and wi?th flei?eyng; Sharp of-takyng, armes spoilyng, So gret bray, so gret crieyng, For þe folk þere was dyeyng, So mychel noyse of dent of swerd, Þe þonder ne had nou?th ben herd, Ne þe sonne ne had ben yseye, For þe dust and þe poudreye; Ne þe walken sen men ne mi?th, So gret was quarels and arewes fli?th. Alisaunder ferde on vche half Als it were an hungry wolf, Whan he comeþ amonges shepe— Wiþ teeþ and clowes he gynneþ hem strepe. A jolyf kyng, ycleped Barrys, Spyeþ Alisaundres prijs. He smoot þe stede and leteþ þe bride, A?eins hym he gynneþ ryde. Alisaunder he smoot vnder þe arme; Þe launce passed wiþouten harme. Ac Alisaunder hym smoot on þe breest, And þe spere þorou? his body þreest. To þe grounde fel þat cors— Nyme who so wolde his hors. Alisaunder and Bulcifal Sleeþ þat he meteþ al. Þis bataile distincted is Jn þe Freinsshe, wel jwys. Þerefore [J] habbe [hit] to coloure Borowed of Latyn a nature, Hou hi?tten þe gentyl kni?ttes, Hou hij contened hem in fi?ttes, On Alisaunders half and Darries also. ?if ?ee willeþ listnen to, ?ee shullen yhere geste of mounde— Ne may non better ben yfounde. Now telleþ þis gest, saunz faile, So on þe shyngel liþe þe haile Euery kni?th so lijþ on oþer. Many man so lees his broþer, Many lefdy hire amy, Many maiden her drury; Many childe his fader lees— Gret and dedly was þe prees. Among þe toyle Hardapilon, On of Alisaunders fon, Sei? Theolomeu, Alisaunders stiward, Bryngen Darryes folk dounward. A riche kyng he was of Mede— He smoot wiþ spores his good stede. A-side he com and smoot Tholomewe, Þat he of his hors hym þrewe. Tholomeu on fote lep, And who hym þrewe he name gode kep. He smoot his stede in þe mane— Þe heued fel fro þe body clane. Hardapilon lep on foot, To Tholomew wiþ swerd and smoot, And a-two cleued his shelde Þat it flei? in þe felde. Tholomeu smoot Hardapilon Vpe helme and bacynett onon; Þe sharp suerd carf þorou? boþe, And þorou? his heued, doun to þe toþe. He lep on his owen stede, And wi?th gan aboute rede. Many abou?th it þertil Þat he of his hors fel. Antigon, ouere al, Was Alisaunders mareschal. Þis mette wiþ Ardomodo, Þat many man had don woo. Ardomodo his spere lete glide Þorou? Antigones lefte side. He hirte hym sore, sikerlich, Ac it nas nou?th dedlich. Antigone smoot hym bet— He hyt hym þorou? þe hert pyt. His feet he knytt on his owen hors, And todrawe dude his corps. Wiþ Alisaunder so was Clitoun, An hardy duk of grete renoun. He was Antigones felawe— Many he brou?th of lijf-dawe. Now he meteþ wiþ Tauryne, A duk, a riche Sarsyne. To euene hei? comen boþe, For whiche þing hij weren wroþe. Her horses heuedlyng metten, Þat hij to grounde aswou?e sterten. Jch ?ou sigge þat þe steden Boþe laien standeden. Clitoun so gan first adawe And his lymes to hym drawe. Tauryn, þoo he ysei? þat, Bigan to dresse vp his hatt. Clitoun roos first, so J fynde, And smoot Tauryn vprisynde On þe helme, wiþ þe swerd, Þat þe dynt stood at þe gird. Wiþ Darry so was Negusar, Kyng of Nynyue, wijs and war. Þat folk tofore hym flei?, certe, Tofore þe lyoun so dooþ þe herte. He smoot Jophas vpon þe mounde, Jn to þe sadel at one wounde. Maglan he took on þe shelde Þat al þe syde rood in þe felde. Fulbor he smoot vpon þe rygge— To þe nauel com þe egge. Ramel he took on þe wombe, And roof hym þorou? als a lombe. Þere nas kni?th on þat syde Þat his strook durst abyde. Gysearme and swerd in honde boþe Negussar so bare, forsoþe. A boþe half duk and kni?th He leide on and slou? doun-ri?th. Philotas sei? and vnderstood Hou Negussar fau?th as he were wood. He smoot to hym and dude hym harme, For of he carf his ri?th arme. Negussar ful wel yfeled Hou his ri?th arme lay in þe feld. Myd þe lefte he name vp his gysarme, And þou?th to do Philotas harme. On two peces he had hym gert, Ne had Clitoun comen ride, cert, Þat put forþ stelen sheld, Negussar dynt þat wiþheld. Þe gysarme carf in þe steel hard, Fer ouer þe mydward. Als he it tukked out to habbe, Philot hym ?af anoþere dabbe, Þat [in] þe shelde þe gysarme Bilaft þoo, and ek þe arme. Negussar so from hym sterte. Wiþ two kni?ttes ?ut he mette, Myd his heued and myd his cors, ?ut he feld hem of her hors, Ac Philotas was at his regge, And smoot hym wiþ þe suerdes egge, Þat þe heued fel a-doun. Nas þere in Perce swiche a baroun. Wil he, nyl he, ded he is— Al Perce for hym careþ, jwys. Permenio, duk of Alisaunders ost, Biside aleide mychel bost, For he smoot Fabular þe admiraile Þorou? þe breest-brede, saun faile, And Macan wiþ þe selue spere Þorou? þe wombe he gan hym bere. Þe spere tobrast, and wiþouten doute Foure kni?ttes hym comen aboute, Wiþ launces in her hondes alle. He bilaued so a walle; Jch ?ou sigge, saunz dotaunces, Alle foure hij breken her launces. Permenio his swerd out drou?, And Helein þan first he slou?, For so he took on his bacyn Þat he cleued hym to þe chyn. After he rau?tte Agilon, Þat he cutted his nekbon. Þe þrid, Gildas, fast fyked, Ac þorou? þe þrote he hym stiked. Þe fierþe, Maurub, a faire baroun, He cleued to þe breest adoun. His hors he ?af to Orest, Þat was to grounde of hors yþrest. Orest he brou?th on stede, And bad hym done gode nede. To many on, in litel stounde, Permenio ?af dedly wounde. Oxeatre had sones two— Fairer ne mi?tten on grounde goo. Darrie þe kyng was her em (Of his syster was þat tem). Þise flowen from Permenione A?eins Nichanore sone. Þe on was cleped Amanas, And þe oþer hi?th Romadas. Þise braken at ones afore Her launces on Nichanore, And he hitte Amanas Wiþ his spere þat sharp was, Jn þe oyl[li]er of þe ei?en, Þat boþe hise ei?en oute flei?en; Þe tronchoun brake in þe brayn. Þat oþere he took w[iþ] mayn, Þat he hym cleued wiþ his swerd broun To his sadles arsoun. Michel woo and grete wailynges Was made for þoo ?ongelynges. Of Oxeatre and Darrie also— Alle Perce made for hem woo. On oþer half hij leggeþ on, So þe mason on þe ston. Þere was many stede yshent, And many gode hauberk to-rent. Many kni?th wiþ deþes wounde Gnou? þe gras on þe grounde. Ac Alisaunder and Tholomeus Myd her waren so vertuous Þat þe ost myd whiche hij mette Hij brou?tten hem out of flette. And for her princes weren yslawe, Hij gonnen flen and wiþdrawe. To Ymagu hij turneden pas, Þere þe kynges standarde was, And maden alle loude crieyng: ‘Socoure vs, Darrie þe kyng! Bot þou do vs nou socoure, Aleide is, Darrie, þine honoure.’ Darrie hereþ cri?eynge— His spores he gynneþ in horse wrynge, And tuenty þousande kni?ttes wiþ hym, Jn herte alle wrooþ and grym. Darrie wiþ a styf launce rytt: Brian, baroun of Grece, he hytt Byneþen þe shelde on þe wombe, And þorou? hym þirleþ so a lombe. Wiþ Alisaunder neren, Ich swere, Nou?th wel fele wi?ttere— Get nomore of hym to speke. Hij strengþed hem hym to wreke. Alle þat Alisaunder hytt Oiþer he þorou?-roof or atwo kytt. He þorou?-þerled euery presse— Was þere non to his prowesse. He had hyd, also J fynde, Asiden on twenty þousynde, Þat shulden comen on fresshe stede Hem to socoure at most nede. Alisaunder and Tholomeus Mid here weren so vertuous Þat hij weren passed ostes two, And to þe þrid comen þoo. Þere was many banere afeld, And ybore-þorou? peynted sheld! Þere was kytt many a cod, And many veyn laten blood! Þere was þirled many side; Many stede drou? his bride! Salome sei? at þat on half Hou Alisaunder, as a wolf Þat fele dawes had yfast Þe shep todraweþ in þe wast, So Alisaunder amonge his men Slou? doun-ri?th, by sex and ten. Wiþ faire ost he comeþ flyng, Wiþ launce arered to bataillyng. Þorou?-out he smyteþ a baroun Þat was yhote Diogioun. Ded he þroweþ hym to grounde— He was a baroun of grete mounde. His men doled for her lorde. Salome quyk draweþ swerde; Jn litel stounde he slou?, jwys, Ten barouns of mychel prys, Vche of his men a Gregeys, Þat weren kni?ttes of grete nobleys. Nas þere non of hem þat lou?, For of sorou? þai hadden ynou?. Jn hem com so mychel howe Þat of felde nei? þai flowe. So hij weren a-cowarded alle Þat hij ferden so dere in halle, And floteden so fyre in felde. Þe folk of Perce so gan abelde, Ac Tyberye so com acost On gode stede tofore his ost, And hitte Salome wiþ his spere Þat of sadel he gan hym bere, Ouer þe croupe to þe grounde. A-swowe he lay a longe stounde; He nas nou?th wounded, bot sore yhert. Þere aroos batayle apert— Ten hundreþ weren to deþ ydi?th Ar he to sadel mounten mi?th. Ac þoo he was to sadel ybrou?th, On boþe half it was wel tou?th. Not noman on whiche syde Þe maistrie so shal bityde. Hors nay?eng and cri?eing of men Men mi?tten yheren mylen ten. Mark þe romayn and Antioche Her gode steden gonnen broche Wiþ tuenty þousande of awayt, And arereden a newe playt. Men mi?tten sen þere kni?ttes defoile, Hertes bleden, braynes boille, Heuedes tumblen, guttes drawe, Many body ouerþrowe. Alisaunder wel streit hem holdeþ- Al his folk ful faire he boldeþ. Wiþ Antioche and Mark of Rome, Þat þoo hym to socoure come, He haueþ so leide on forto slen Þat alle Perciens gunnen flen. Darrie þerof was ywar— So woo ne was hym neuere ar. He dooþ hym on a stede corroure, And flei?eþ away wiþouten socoure, Leteþ meigne, wijf, and childe, And fleeþ als a beeste wilde, And Alisaunder crieþ onon: ‘Quyk after Darrie, euerychon!’ Men mi?th seen þoo after ride, Wiþ drawe swerd and lacche bride, Kyng and duk, kni?th and baroun. Arnen þe steden grete raundoun, Ac Alisaunder vpon Bulciphal Ridynge passed his poeple al, After Darrie myd al [hi]s mi?th, Forto it were wel nei? ni?th. Darry hym hyd vnder a lynde, Þat Alisaunder ne mi?th hym fynde; Ne mi?th hym fynde kni?th ne grome, For he was hyd in lynde and brome. Alisaunder so went a?ein; Quyk him siwed alle his men. He took Darries moder and wijf, And his dou?tter, a leue lijf, And leuedies and damoysele, So many þat J noot hou fele. Þere dude Alisaunder curteisie— He kepte hem from vche vilenye, Darries moder and Darries wijf, And his dou?tter, a swete lijf. Þe oþere lefdyes, after þat hij ware, To kni?ttes weren deliuered þare, And damoisels to garsouns Weren made þere alle commouns. Coupes, pelles, broches, rynges, Herneys, armes, oþer þinges, Alisaunder freli di?ttes After werþe amonge his kni?ttes. Þere nas knaue ne quystroun Þat ne had his warisoun. He had prisouns, als J fynde, Gentil-men an hundreþ þousynde. To diuers castels he hem sent, Summe to Grece to present, Summe to Libye, summe to Rome, And swore þat hij ne shulde out come Forto he were of Darrye awreke, Þat men mi?tten þerof speke. Now gynneþ þe sonne to grounde helde. ?ut stondeþ olyfauntz in þe felde; Vche bare twelue oiþer sextene kni?th, Wel arenged snelly to fi?th— Of hem weren fourty þousynde. Þe kyng hem assailed byhynde. Þere was bataile so stronge Nas non swiche in þe day longe. Tholomeu þoo com to socour, Wiþ tuenty þousande of gret valour, And Antioche and Tyberye also. Abouten hij gonnen goo, Par force smyten in to þe þrenge, And duden beestes from oþere derenge. Þus hij comen hem bitwene, And stikeden fele, al so kene, And þe kni?ttes of þe castels Þus hij slou?en swiþe feles. Þester it was, ne mi?tten men seen— Fele ascapeden and gonnen flen. Alisaunder þerof had sorou?; He most drawe to herberew?e. He went quyk to pauillouns, Wiþ alle his dukes and barouns. Wiþ tuenty þousande gode kni?ttes He dude hym warde þat ilk ni?t. In tyme of Maij þe ni?ttyngale Jn wood makeþ mery gale. So don þe foules, grete and smale, Summe on hylles and summe in dale. Þe day daweþ, þe kyng awakeþ; He and hise men her armes takeþ. Hij wendeþ to þe batailes stede, And fyndeþ nou?th bot bodies dede. ?onge and elde fele hij fonde— Kni?ttes dede of Grece londe. Alle he dude hem brynge on erþe, After þat hij weren werþe; For hem was made wel grete doel. After þat was parted þe spoyle, Þat vche man was wel ypayed, Also Ich tofore ?ou saide. Þennes to Nichomedie he tourneþ, A stronge cite, and þere soiourneþ. Darries dou?tter, sister, and wijf He saueþ so his owen lijf, Jn mete, in drynk, in cloþing, And in al oþer þing, And spyeþ whider Darrie is went. God vs ?iue auauncement! Mery is þe blast of þe styuoure; Mery is þe touchyng of þe harpoure. Swete is þe smellyng of þe floure; Swete it is in maydens boure. Appel swete bereþ fair coloure; Of trewe loue is swe[te] amoure. Darry to Babiloyne is went, And after socoure haþ ysent. First to hym comen, saunz faile, Alle þat flowen from þe bataile. Fair chyualrie hym com from Mede Wel y-armed on hei?e stede, So hym dude from al Asye— Com wel faire compaignye. From Saba and from Pentapolis Michel poeple hym com, jwys. From Pamphile and from Lyde Many kni?th to hym com ryde. Out of Jnde, from Prestre John, Hym com kni?ttes manyon. So mychel puple com from souþe Þat noman tellen it ne couþe. So mychel poeple he had and gynge Þe erþe quaked in þe berynge. Of his poeple þe grete praye Lasted twenty milen waye. Alle hij þreteneþ, grete and lyte, Alisaunders heued of to smyte. To Alisaunder com þe tidyng Of þe poeple and of þe þretyng. He sent messagers of nobleye Jn to Grece, jn to Achaye, Jn to Egipte, jn to Libye, Jn to Cesyle, jn to Lumbardye, Jn to Chaumpayne, jn to Rome, To alle þat weren vnder his dome. Quyklich he sent his sondes To alle þe justises of þe londes Þat he haueþ vndur sonne Wiþ dynt of batayle to hym wonne: Hij shulden senden alle þe kni?ttes Þat on hors riden mi?tt, And bowe-men and arblasters, And alle þat hadden powers To beren wepen of defense. Hij shulden hym senden, wiþ her despense, An hundreþ þousande and fyfty þerto, ?e, and tuenty þousande mo. Kni?ttes and men of grete vigoure Comen quyk to his socoure. Als sone as hij beeþ alle ycome, Alisaunder þe way haþ ynome Wiþ al his folk toward Darrye, For lenger nolde he sparye. He passed [T]auryn þe hei?e hille; Þere stood a spere, so men telle— Jn þe grounde it stiked fast Þat neuer more shadewe cast. Who so drou?e it of þe molde Þe werlde to wille wynne he sholde. Darrie had yben þare, And many kyng and ek kaysare, Ac non ne mi?th it vp drawe, Ne nou?th it in þe grounde wawe. Þoo Alisaunder it sei? he lou?e, And atte first vp it drou?e. Al his folk forsoþe, jwys, Þere-of hadden grete blys; To Tebes ward hij wendeþ whate. Hij sheteþ a?eins hym þe gate— Þe kyng it hete of þat cite, So ful he was of iniquite. Tebes was a cite riche; Non in þe werlde nas it iliche, Bot it be Rome al one, Þat pere ne had none. Tuelue gates þere weren abouten, Þat assaut non ne douten, And vche gate of þe toun Loked erle oiþer baroun, Þat hadden citees and castels, And vnder hem kni?ttes feles. To eueryche of þe tuelue gate So lay þere an hei?e strate, Also noble of riche mounde As is Chepe þat is in Lounde. Þat cite was ri?th fyne riche, And wel ywalled wiþ stronge dyche. Ethmes hi?th her kyng— He was of Edippes ofspryng, Fel, and proud, and stout also, And þat hym fel to mychel woo. He ofsent his baronye And ek al his bachelrye. Alle hij consenteden, saun faile, To Alisaunder ?iuen bataile. Wel hij wardeþ þe gates alle, þe fortresses and þe walle. Þoo Alisaunder hereþ it telle, His ost he hoteþ þider snelle. Quyklich to Tebe toun Hij wenten and seged it enviroun. Þere was assaut gret wiþ alle, For hij þat weren wiþinne þe walle Wiþ arblast, mangonel, and bowe, Duden þe oþere woo and howe. Alisaunder and his barouns Hadden telt her pauylouns, And wenten to þassaut sone Ri?th abouten þe ?onge none. Þe gate þat hi?th Dardanidas Þat tyme vnloken was. Of Tebes comen ride þoo Þre þousande kni?ttes and moo, Wi?th of mayn and stronge bones, Ycoiled alle for þe nones, Armed alle in gyse of Fraunce, Wiþ faire pensel and styf launce. For hem alle on gan crye, And seide ‘Alisaunder!’ þrie, ‘Whare artou, hores son, whare? An hore þee to man bare. Þou auetrolle! þou vile wrecche! Here þou shalt þine endyng fecche. Come and ?iue vs on justyng, And þou shalt haue hard metyng.’ Alisaunder swore onon-ri?th By him þat was God almi?th, And he my?th it ywynne, Noiþer for loue ne for gynne Nolde he wiþ hem acorde, Ac alle hij shulden to þe swerde And al þe cite ben forbarnd. For[þ] he is wiþ þat y-?arnd, And wiþ his launce meteþ a duk, And sent his soule to Belsabuk. Þere was many pensel good Quyk ybaþed in hote blood; Many heued a-two yslytt, Many lyme from body kytt, And also many gentil cors Was fouled vnder feet of hors. Þere laien on grounde moo þan ynowe, Summe steruande and summe in swowe. Þere was ycome out of Athene A ?onge kni?th, jolyf and kene. To Tebes he com, jwys, Forto wynne loos and prys. He was þe emperoures sone— Wel to juste was his wone. Natha[na]eles son he sai?, A ?onge kni?th also of grete disray. He smyt þe stede and lacheþ þe bride— A?eins hym he gynneþ ride. A le[un]cel was on his spere— Wi?th he gynneþ a?ein hym bere, Smyt hym þorou? armes, lunge, and lyuer. Þe shafte crakkeþ, al to-shyuer. Nathanaeles son slaw?en is, Fast by Alisaunder, jwys. Þe ?onge kni?th his bridel turneþ, And to þe oþere syde erneþ. Þoo of Tebes cryeþ in blis; Alisaunder folk doleþ, jwys, For þe kni?th þat was yslawe, For he was ri?th gode felawe. ?ut þe ?onge kni?th of Athene Draweþ his swerd bri?th and shene. Þre he sleþ of Grece londe, And to of Trace, Ich vnderstonde. Þe sexte he slou? of Nauarre he was. Þe seuenþe he slou? þat was of Tas. Alisaunder ysei? ful wel Þat he dude to his folk vche del. He groop on honde a styf spere, And Bulcyphal swiþe gan hym bere. He mett Madan, þe ?onge kni?th, A?ein þe breest wiþ al his mi?th, Þat þorou? þe herte þe launce flang, And þorou? þe chyne an elnen lang. Hij of Tebes gunnen graden And for hym grete doel maden. (Jt nas no wonder—gret stal he stood; Amonge hem alle was non so good) And took þat he had wi?th Among hem alle, þre þousande kni?th, Þat hem holdeþ alle ylore. Away hij habbeþ her lorde ybore To Athenes, wel fer þenne, And beri?ed hym among his kynne. Þoo of Tebes fast fou?tty, And þoo of Grece as kni?ttes dou?tty, And of Tebes, in litel stounde, Þre hundreþ laid[en] to grounde. Þe Tebans sei?en hou men hem slou?en, And to her gates ward hem drou?en. Þe gates hem weren quyk vnshett, And quyk hij beeþ alle jn stert. Ac ar þe ?ates weren yloke Many panne þere was tobroke, Many vyle cry was grad, Many brayn þere was yshad. Naþeles, atte last, Þe gates weren shet wel fast. Alisaunder and his folk alle Fast assaileden her walle, Wiþ berefrei and wiþ alle gynne, ?if hij mi?tten it ywynne, And þoo of Tebes hem bistireden, And her walles wi?tly wereden. Wiþ sharp quarels and wiþ flon, Wiþ hoote water and grete ston, Wiþ wilde-fyre þat hij casten, Hij slou?en many and agasten, Ac wiþ targes and hurdise Gregeis hem wereden als þe wise, And þe kyng hete al his meynee Quyk assaylen þat cyte Al aboute, euery man, And eueryche don þat he can. Summe shete and summe þrewe— Þe slau?tte mi?th vche man rewe, For hij ne mi?tten heued vp habben Bot hij lau?tten dedly dabben. Vche of hem byment oþere, Frende felawe, kni?th his broþere. Þassautte com so þikk and swiþe Þat no weryng ne mi?tth hem liþe. Men mi?tten seen þere hondes wrynge, Palmes beten, h[er]es tirynge, Spray, and grade, and dismayeyng, Wymmen shrikyng, gyrles gradyng. Þe kyng ne haþ of hem pyte non— He hete his men euerychon ?iuen assaut ni?th and day, Wiþ al þat eueryche can and may. He nolde hem ?iue restynge, Ne trewes for no biddynge, Ne þe proude of þat cite And ful of vche iniquitee Raunsoun nolden ?iuen ne bede. Þe kyng ful wel sei? her pride, And hete quyk his fote-men alle Bryngen tymber to þe walle, And so hij deden, and leiden a-side, Þat men mi?tten þere-on ride. By þe queyntise of þe kyng Was made vp swiche a ridyng, Maugre þe Tebans euerychon, Þe gode kni?th Permenion Js yride vp to þe walle, And lepen adoune amonge hem alle On his stede in alle his armes. Þe Tebans lepen aboute his harmes, Hastiflich hym forto slen, And wiþ shelde he gan hym wren And wiþ suerd defenden his cors, Ac vnder hym hij slow?en his hors. Vp he lep on fote, syker, And fonde hem alle propre byker. He hem to-hiwe by fyue, by sex, So þe bocher dooþ þe oxe. Whiles þe poeple of þe toun Entended to Permenioun, Þe kyng dude a noble skek— Þe ?ates par force vp he brek; Jn to þe cite he com dasshe, Wiþ al his poeple, more and lasse. Þe quyke ?ede to þe swerde, Kni?th and squy?er wiþ her lorde; Fair and foul, man and wijf, Þere loren her swete lijf. Tofore þe kyng com on harpoure, And made a lay of gret sauoure, Jn whiche he seide, wiþ mery cry: ‘Kyng, on vs haue mercy! Here-jnne was borne Amphion, Fader, kyng, of goddes euerychon, And Liber, þe god of wyne, And Hercules, of kynne þine— Here hadden þe goddes her norture. Þis toun þou shalt, sir kyng, honure— A?eins hem þi wraþþe adaunte, ?iue hem mercy and pes hem graunte.’ Also quyk, al þe contreye Þat weren of þe kynges feye Gradden and gunnen þe kyng to preche Þat he shulde take of hem wreche, And seiden wel are þat tyme Al Grece was of hem envenyme. Hij hym telden hou Edippus Had yslawe his fader Layus, And more woo atte last— Hou he wedded his moder Jocast, And in hir bi?ate twynnes two (None wers ne mi?tten go: Þe first was Ethiocles, Þat oþer was Pollymyces— Of pride nas non hir yliche); Hou hij stryueden for þe kyngriche, Hou for hem weren slayn in fi?ttes Of Grece alle þe gode kniþttes, Ypomedon and Tydeus, Amphiroae and Adrastus, And þe faire Partonepus, And þe stronge duk Capaneus. Of wymmen hij tolden þe iniquite Jn þat tyme of þat cite. Þoo þe kyng had þis yherd, He dude slee dounri?th wiþ suerd Man and wijf, childe and hounde, Vche lyues body jn to grounde, And wilde-fyre þere-on sette, Þat brent doune jn to þe flette Tymber, ston, and þe morter, And made of Tebes a place cler. Neuere siþþen þe destroieyng Nas in Tebes wony?ing, Bot as it were a wete lake Js now Tebes þat man of spake, Þat was cite of mest werþe, Of alle þat weren in erþe. For her synne and dede on-hende Nou is it brou?th out of mynde; Þus ended Tebes cite. God on vs haue pyte, And lene vs so to þryue We moten come to his lyue, Whan we shullen hennes wende, And lyuen w[iþ] hym wiþouten ende. Mery it is in sonnes risynge— Þe rose openeþ and wile vpspringe. Wayes faireþ, þe clayes clyngeþ, Þe medes floureþ, þe foules syngeþ. Damoysels makeþ mournyng Whan her leues shullen make partyng. Þe kyng þan wiþ his ost wendeþ. To many cite his sonde he sendeþ, Als he wendeþ by þe waye. Homage nolde hym non wiþsaye, Ac alle hij duden hym feute, And swore hym hoolde-oþe and leute, And ?auen hym ?iftes of grete pryse, And founden hym kni?ttes to seruise. Ac þoo he com nei? Athene, Jt was a cite proude and kene. Of Grece it bare þe maistrie Of marchaundise and ek clergie. Alisaunder his lettres sendeþ— Þe messageres þerwiþ wendeþ. To Atheneys hij beeþ ytake; Word for woord þus hij spake: ‘Alisaunder, þe stronge kyng, To Atheneis sendeþ gretyng! We weren a-slepe—Darrie vs wei?tte. Tol he asked wiþ vnri?th. We habbeþ ymade his acorde Wiþ ston, wiþ launce, and wiþ swerde, And fiftene kynges of grete pryse We habbeþ ywonne to oure seruise. Of barouns, dukes, grete and smale, Ne cunne we nou?th of alle þe tale. To ?ou we habbeþ also ysent. ?ee heren oure comaundement: Sendeþ vs, to gode hans, On hundreþ þousande besauntz, (From ?er to ?er ne mowen ?ee faile) And on þousande kni?ttes to bataile. Wiþ nomore wil Ich ?ou karke, Ac quyk Ich hote þat ?ee it ?arke Þat Ich habbe by a skryt ?ou seide, Oiþer ?ee shullen ben sore ennoyed.’ Þo þis skryt was red and herd, Many rededen in þe berd, And seiden hij wolden wiþ hym fi?th Ar hij þoleden swiche vnri?th, And maden a skryte of swiche spekyng A?ein to Alisaunder þe kyng: ‘To Alisaunder, þe stronge kyng, Folk of Athenes sendeþ gretyng. Sir, als þou art gent and curteys, Lete vs libbe in griþþe and pays. No kyng ?ut of no parage Neuer had of vs trowage. Philipp þi fader asked swiche ?elde, Ac we hym dryuen out of þe felde, And so we han alle oþere kynges Þat vs askeden swiche þinges. ?if þou wilt haue swiche vn?eld, Þou come and ask it in þe feld, And we shullen don þee of londe skyppe, And so we deden þi fader Philippe. He is ded; we ben ful fawe (Þe soþe to þee we ben aknawe). So we wolde þat þou ware, For many man þou hast don kare. Lete bileuen þine outrage, Oiþer þou shalt lacche dedly damage.’ Alisaunder haþ herd þis wrytt— Wood he is nei? out of his wytt. He swore hij shulden sore abygge Wiþ sharp launce and swerdes egge. Boþe of þe lewed and of þe lered He wolde delyuer þis middlerd, So he of Tebes hadde ydo. Anoþer lettre he sent hem to, Of a feloun and bitter tenure— Hereþ it alle, par amoure: ‘[?]e proude and stoute of Athene Habbeþ ydon me herte tene. Of ?ou Ich wil me so awreke Þat al þe werlde shal þer-of speke. Quyk me sendeþ ten barouns, Þe noblest of ?oure regiouns. Quyk Ich wil done hem serue— Þe tunges out of her heuedes kerue, And her feet and her hondes also, For hij me han despised so. Afterward tofore my si?th Vpon a tree hij shullen ben pi?th, And hongen in þe wynde and reyn. Her wicked conseil hij shullen abyne. Now dooþ quyklich myne hest, Or Ich me wil awreke of most and lest.’ Athenes was ful of riche spicerie, And of clerkes þat couþen mychel clergie, Of kni?th and faire bachelrye, Of many faire maiden and leuedye— Of al þe werlde hij baren drewrye. A clerk gan þe lettre vnplye, And haþ yseide, wiþ loude crye, Tofore al þat compaignye. Jt was ri?th after þe tenure Þat first spaak þe emperoure. He was a fair elde hore man— Tofore hem alle þus he bigan: ‘Lordynges, Alisaunder þe kyng Haþ on erþe non euenyng. Hardy is his flesshe and blood; His ost is mychel, wi?th, and good. Boþe in palays and in batayle He dooþ by Aristotles conseile; By hym he is so ful of gynne Þat alle men he may wynne. He haþ wonne Grece and Lumbardie, Achaie, Runele, and Romanye, Genne, Prouince, Burgoyne acoste, And Sauoie, al to Oste, Þe marchis of Fraunce and of Spayne, And Coloyne, and ek Almayne, And Egipte and ek Barbarye, And dryuen out of felde Darrye— Ytaken his children and his wyue. Jt nys nou?th myd hym forto stryue. He ne askeþ vs bot litel tense— A fewe besauntz to his despense. Þe peny is of riche mounde Þat ysaueþ þe hole pounde. Hij ben worþi to habben care Þat nylleþ ben by oþere yware. Tebes, Sydoyne, and Tyre He haþ destroied wiþ wilde-fyre, And alle þat he rebel founde He haþ sleyn to þe grounde. Þat he askeþ do we hym sende, And make we hym oure frende. Better is so, Ich ?ou telle, Þan he vs take and alle aquelle. Who so ne wil by oþer hym chaste, Ouerþrowe he shal in haste.’ After hym spaak Dalmadas— A riche almacur he was, Faire man, queynt, and vertuous, Fel and hardy, and corageous: ‘Emperoure’, he seide, ‘þou spekest to depe! Jch am so trayed þat nei? Ich wepe. Niltou neuere, late ne skete, A goshauk maken of a kete, Ne faukon maken of bosard, Ne hardy kni?th make [of] coward. Ac þou canst make kni?ttes gode Wiþ þi prechyng cowardes of blode. For no power ne for no wonder ?ut ne weren we neuere vnder. Philippe his fader we ouercomen— Tuenty þousande of hise we nomen. Þe kyng of Perce and oþer ynowe, We ouercomen her folk and s[lo]we, And Serses, þe riche kyng of Mede, Hadde he neuere non swiche felaurede His oste wri?ed þe cee and þe londe, ?ut he crepe vnder ?oure honde. His heued he leide þee to wedde, And many þousande of hise [w]e fedde. Þat day þou haddest herte of prise, And now he is ful of cowardise, Þat woldest ?iue vile trowage, And so duden none of þi lynage. More honoure it is faire to sterue Þan in seruage vilely serue. Take we mayne in oure honde, And dryue we hym out of londe— We habbe[þ] þerto kni?ttes ynowe. Oure is þe ri?th, her is þe wowe.’ Þe folkes herte so gan sprynge A?eins Alisaunder þe kynge, And seiden Dalmadas was a god kni?t, And had seide sooþ and ri?th. Alle hij wolden hem bistere Her londes ri?th forto were, And gonne crie at one cry Alle hij were þerto redy. Ac Demostenes, a riche amyraile, Seide hem anoþer conseile: ‘Lordynges’, he seide, ‘for þe emperoure Ne leseþ nou?th ?oure honoure. And ?if he haueþ wel yseide, Ne beeþ nou?th a?eins hym enoyede, Ne dooþ nou?th by Dalmadas, So þat ?ee siggen after “allas!” And for ?oure pride and ?oure outrage Lesen wijf and childe and heritage. Þe kyng ?ou redeþ þat ?ee acorde, And maken Alisaunder ?o[u]re lorde. ?if ?ee willen helden hym wiþ, ?ee shullen habbe pes and griþ. And þou hast wel spoken, Dalmadas. Whilom we token Margaras, And Corynce, and ek Perce, And mo þan Ich wil reherce. Where ben now also þine kni?ttes? Hastou þem redy now to fi?ttes? Jn al þis cite ne shuldestou fynde Of gode kni?ttes oo þousynde, And he haþ an hundreþ þousynd and an oþer. Helde þou þi pays, my gode broþer! ?iueþ ?ee besauntz and makeþ paise, And þan mowen ?ee libbe at aise.’ Dalmadas hym seide þo: ‘Þou art elde man and nei? ydo— Þi werlde is sone ydon, Þerfore makestou strengþe non. Þei? we fare þe lenge þe wers, Wiltou nou?th paie of þi purs Neiþer besaunt ne fierþe peny, Ac shullen þe pouere vche halpany.’ Grete stryf was bitwene þe elde And þe ?onge, þat weren belde. Naþeles, þe elde men, saun faile, Wonnen þe maistrie of þe consaile, And deden it vpon Demostenes Þat he shulde maken her pes. Demostenes was a baroun of prys— Wel norisshed man of resoun, jwys. He takeþ on honde þis message, And wiþ hym wel fair baronage, Wise men, and kene and belde, And alle nei? of his elde. He passeþ boþe dales and dounes, Many cites and many tounes, Forto he com to þat plas Þere Alisaunder yloged was. He satt and played at þe ches, Wiþ a Griffoun of heþenes. Þre hundreþ tofore hym stode, Flumbardelynges, kni?ttes gode, Shred in silk of riche prise, Redy to þe kynges seruise. Demostenes is ali?th, And comeþ amonges hem al ri?th. Bot he be ful wel ytau?tte, Wiþouten skorne ne passeþ he nou?th! Tofore þe kyng on knee he duelleþ, And gentillich his tale he telleþ: ‘Kyng Alisaunder,’ he seide, ‘of kynges flour, God þe kepe in þine honoure! Þe kyng of Athene regiouns Þe greteþ ofte and his barouns. Hij hem ?eldeþ in alle wise And in al þing to þi seruise. Þis coroune he þee sent Of gold and ?ymmes to present, And þis swerd of steel cler, And þis launce wiþ þe baner (Þe baner is wiþ gold ydrawe— Nys non on erþe wider yknawe), And a þousande besauntz of golde, For hij þee faire seruen wolde. Hendelich biseken hij þee Þat þou be hor avowe. For?iue hem, sir, þi mautalent! Hij willeþ don þi comaundement.’ Þe kyng leteþ þe gamen of þe ches, And lokeþ on Demostenes. He takeþ þe coroune in honde on hast— Atwo he it tofrussht al-mast, And seide: ‘Wene ?ee now of Athene ?ou be for?ouen myne tene? Nay, by myne lay Ich sigge, ?ee it shullen wel sore abygge. Jch wil be wroken, on al wise, On þem þat duden me despise. Þe emperour and his barouns Alle shullen abiggen, by Dans Mahouns.’ ‘Sjr’ quoþ Demostenes, ‘þi men þou mi?t spille. Hij hem ?eldeþ al to þi wille— Mercy hij bidden þee, sir fre, Of þat hij seiden a?eins þee. Þe emperour boþe and his barouns ?elden hem to þine baundouns, Wiþ body and chatel, nei? and ferre, Þee to helpen to þi werre.’ So fair spekeþ Demostenes Þe kyng haþ graunted his pes, And sendeþ hem a wryt onon, Þat þus was red tofore vchon: ‘Alisaunder forleteþ his tene A?eins þe barouns of Athene, And afongeþ þis coroune Jn þe name of raunsoune, And þe suerde and þe banere, By suffraunce of swiche manere Þat ?ee make amendement Of Leonyne, my baroun gent, Þat ?ee slou? in ?oure alan, Whan Ich com from Perce a?an.’ Hym was delyuered, onon-ri?ttes, A þousande besauntz and a þousande kni?ttes (Dalmadas was her cheuentayn— An hardy baroun of grete mayn), And Alisaunder, wiþouten assoigne, Haþ forþ his ost to Macedoyne. Lorde, mychel bost was þare! Many jobet and many ware, Many turforþ and many jouaunt, Many asse and mule and olifaunt, Many stede and many palfray, Many gentil kni?th and many vile bey, Many baroun wel ful of þewe, Many ledron, many foule shrewe, Many baner, many pensel, Many swerd of bri?th stel, Many destrer in couerture, Many kni?th in riche armure, Many faukun, many spere, Many goshauk, many laynere, Many wiþ cry, many wiþ song— Þe ost was tuelue mylen long. So hij wenden, by waye and paþe, To Macedoyne hij comen raþe. Þere hij weren stoutely lette— Þe gates weren a?ein hem shett. Wiþ mangenels, gunnes, and bowe, Hij duden þe ost mychel howe. Ten þousende of armed kni?tt On wryen stedes weren ydi?tt Comen out and houen in þe strete, Wiþ Alisaunder forto mete. Þoo Alisaunder it herd telle, He spaak wiþ tunge als a belle— He hete quyklich al þe route Bysette þe cite al aboute, And so hij deden, also swiþe, And maden many man vnbliþe, For gadelynges, ful of iniquite, Setten fyre aboute þat cite, And teke þat al þe cuntreye, Þere-abouten, by fyue mylen waye. Þe cite had foure hundre turel— Þe lest was worþ a castel. Alisaunder hymself comeþ flynge Alþer-first to þat justynge. He smoot a duk hote Coronde, Þat ?af hem conseil hym wiþstonde, Þorou? shelde and breny, and þorou? þe chyne— He most nedes his lijf fyne. Tholomeus smoot Pharan, Þat he fel ded in þe fan.

Þe oþere in to þe walles steeþ And þe kynges men wiþ gynnes sleeþ. Þe cite vpe þe cee stood— An-hatt is Alisaunders blood. He hete his folk so a wode wolf Assailen hem on þe cee half, And so hij deden, wiþ mi?tty honde. Þe pouer folk of þe londe And þe lefdyes, bri?th in boure, Sei?en þat hij ne mi?tten dure. Hij stelen þe kayes vnder þeir ?ate— Þe kyng þere hij leten jn whate, And fellen a-knowe in þe strete, Tofore and vnder his horses fete, Crieden mercy, þe kyng it herd. He hete vche man don jn his swerd; He vnderfenge her fewte. Alle hij sworen hym leute, More and lesse, euerychone. Þe kyng afongeþ her mone, And wiþouten more tale Makeþ hem alle his speciale, And þere he ordeyneþ his wendyng Toward Darrye þe riche kyng. Now listneþ, wiþouten gyle, Hou Darrie dooþ þerwhile.

Darrie in a verger is, Tofore hym many kni?th of prys. Þre hundreþ þousande, als J fynde, He had of his owen heldynge, And fourty þousande kni?ttes souders. Noot Ich no tale of his squyers, Ne of vavasoures ne of bachilers, Ne of b[o]wers ne of arblasters. A-loude among hem euerychone Darrie makeþ þus his mone: ‘Lordynges,’ he seide, ‘Ich am a-shamed, And wers anoyed and agramed, Þat Alisaunder, wiþ mi?tty honde, Haþ me dryuen out of my londe, My suster and my moder ytake, And Floriaundre, my gentil make, Myne children, and my menage.

More fair it is, saunz faile, Þat we wende hym to assaile Ar he come here on vs, For he is hardy and corageous. Nyl he lete for no trauaile Þat he ne wil vs abataile. Jn þe col[e], in þe daweynge, Wende we wiþ alle gynge; Þan we mowen, l[o], God it woot! R[e]sten oure beestes in þe hote. Who-so careþ, he haþ wou?, For we haue strengþe and folk ynou?.’ Þoo bispaak Joroboans: ‘Here now, Darrie, riche soudans! Now, sir, quyk and snelle, Do ringen alle þine belle, And do þi self þi peyne Al þi folk to ordeyne. Þine olifauntz and þine beest Do alle ordeyne on hast, And do hem done in þe waye, Þat hij weren in feld contreye, For Alisaunder is ypassed Achaye, And is ycome to Arabye, And is on þis half þe flum Jordan, And so me seide a drugeman. Haue we þe feld ar he, We shullen hym wynne, hym maugre.’ Quyk was don his conseile— Ycharged olifauntz and camaile, Dromedarien, and ek oxen, Mo þan ?e connen asken. Alle weren dryuen arenge— Ten mylen hij ?eden alenge. After comen þe somers, And þan kni?ttes on her destrers. Many stede þere proudely lep, Stillelich and many wep. Þe reccheles and þe proude songen, Þe cowardes her hondes wrongen. Þere þou mi?th ysee bere Many faire pensel on spere, Many kni?th wiþ helme of steel, Many shelde ygylt ful wel, Many trappe, many troupere, Many queyntise and armes clere. Þe erþe quaked hem alle vnder, Ne shulde man haue herd þe þonder For þe noyse and þe tabours, And þe trumpes and jugelours. To a water hij beþ ycome, Þere hij habbeþ herberewe ynome, For hij habbe[þ] ytaken kep Þe ryuere is cler and dep. At þat half stant hem no doute Of Alisaunder ne al his route. Þe feldes tofore ben brode and wyde— Hij fonde to warden þat side Wiþ cartes and waynes stronge (Fiftene mylen hij stondeþ alonge). Pauylouns were alle wiþinne, Strongelich ytelt, by gynne. Warde hij setten by vche a syde; Þere hij willen Alisaunder abide, And he is comande wel gode spede. God vs help at al oure nede! Lordynges, after mete ariseþ pleie. Þe coward is wel looþ to deie; Late slowe man keuereþ preie. His ost lasteþ tuenty mile weie. Hij passen Cisile contreie And Mede, and ben in Armeineie. Hem tofore nys bot deþ, For his pidaile brenneþ and sleþ Al þat hij fynden mowe. Ten myle wayes, Ich wil avowe, Hij brenten doun-ri?th tofore þe ost, And also fele þe kyng a-cost. Hij robbeden tresores and cloþes, And brenten tounes and þe heþes. Þe smok was so gret and leyte Þat Darries ost it dude awayte. Wiþ hym com many fair stede feraunt, And many fair destrer curraunt, And many fatt palfrey aumblaunt, And many armed olyfaunt, Many baroun and many sergeaunt, Many stronge kni?th and many geaunt. Hij riden a water so a-coost Þat hij mowen kenne Darryes ost. At þe oþere syde akennyng Hij sei?en Darries ost þe kyng. Þe kyng þere telt his pauylouns, And his dukes and his barouns; Ne sei? man neuere in none contree Non so noble assemblee. Þere leued Alisaunder þe kyng, For to aspye Darries beyng. On a day þe kyng name kep Þat þe water was swift and dep. He bad his sergeauntz hem amonge Brynge hym his armes, heuy and stronge. And so hij deden, and he wiþouten oþes Quyklich dude of his cloþes. Þe armes he dude on his lyche, And al his folk had ferliche What he wolde y-armed do, And jn to þe water he lep þo. He swam in þe heuy armes A mile weie wiþ strengþe of armes, Ac þei? he were stronge and bolde, Þe water was wel styf and colde. Maugre hym, he most synk A bowe-shote from þe brynk. Þoo he feled adrenche he shulde, An hei? he sprong, so God it wolde, And helde hym aboue þat he ne sank, Tyl þat he com to a bank, Þat he bileued vnneþe alyue. To boot his men duden hem blyue: Als sone as hij to hym comen, Jn to boot hij hym nomen. Jn his body was litel onde; Quyk hij ledden hym to londe. Þere was grad a gret cryeyng Þat ded was Alisaunder þe kyng. Þere gan gon a fisicyan— Philippe he hete, a queynte man. He bad hem lete her waylynge— He wolde, he seide, to lyue hym brynge. He dude hym bere to pauylouns, And saued hym wiþ pociouns, And made hym hole man and fere. Now þe gest telleþ here [Of] þis leche Philippoun, [An]d of a baroun Permenyoun— Of [h]is onde, of [bi]wreyeyng, Þat shulde ben seide to þe kyng. Ac for þe latyn seiþ þere-a?an, Ne wil ich [hit s]hewe þ[is] b[o]re[l] man, For [in] þis book fer J fynde Of Permenyon and of his kynde, Þat þorou? her noble rest Þe kynges dedes weren honest. Þe kyng is hoole, may ride and goo. Oþere þing now listneþ to: Kyng Alisaunder, þat loged is, And his kni?ttes of grete prijs, Vpon a water yhote Tygres; At þe oþere half is Darrye, jwys, Wrooþ and grym and alle hise, For Alisaunders gret aprise. Þaspies on boþe sydes gooþ, Telleþ lesynges and telleþ sooþ Of Alisaunder and ek of Darrye, Hou vche hym shal from oþere warye, Hou þe riche dukes hi?tten, And whiche weren þe stronge kni?tten. Þorou? þabet of her spye, Often þe ?onge bachelrye Ouer Tigre to oþere ferde, And hem proued wiþ launce and swerd, And maden many kni?th and knaue Jn medes and felde ded bilaue. On a day, Tholomeus, Hardy baroun and corageous, Maark of Rome clepeþ to hym, And þe sauage Salabym, And Tyberie, and Antiochus, And Gaudyn, and Antigonus, And ten þousande dukes and kni?ttes— None in þe ost of more mi?ttes. ‘Lordynges,’ he seiþ, ‘hereþ now me. We ben here foule in treie: Skarselich we eteþ and drynkeþ, And for our mete nou?th swynkeþ. We ben kni?ttes of hei?e parage, And ben yshett so foule in cage. On spye haþ tolde to me Þat þe admyrail Salome And þe duk Antonye of Cartage, And Archelaus, of proude corage, And þe soudanes broþer, And many proude gome, on and oþer, Willeþ wenden in þe morowenyng, And vpon vs maken a skekkyng. Our lorde is now in his rest— Wende we, wiþouten chest, Ouer þe water Ich woot, ?onder est, And hiden vs in þe forest, And whan hij comeþ sodeynlich Smyte we on hem manlich. Wil ?ee don by my conseile?’ ‘?e!’ hij seiden alle, saun faile. Jn gode armes hij gonnen hem shrede, And lepen vpon gode stede. Þe pauylouns hij rideþ a-coost— Þe kyng it noot, ne his ost. Þe water quyklich hij passe, At one sholpe, more and lesse. On londe hij ben ouer þe brynk (Many of hem it dude of-þynk!) Quyk hij gynneþ þennes ride, And hiden hem in a forest-syde. Now bigynneþ riche gest. God vs ?iue in heuene rest! Horses strengþe and hardynesse Sheweþ many faire prowesse. Nis non so fair þing, so Crist me blisse, As kni?th y-armed in queyntise, Bot þe preest in Goddes seruyse. Sitteþ now stille on al wise, For here bigynneþ gest arise Of dou?tty men and gret of prise. Salome, Archelaus, and Jonas, Sabym, Besas, and Barsonas, And Oxeatre, Darries odam, And tuenty þousande kni?ttes, alle ?onge men, Hard warded, saunz doute, Þat ni?th hadden yfare aboute. Now hij comen homward, And ymeten chaunce hard, For ri?th in þe dayes sprynge Tholomeus on hem com flei?eynge. ‘Traturs!’ he seide, ‘we haue brou?th Þe tol ?ee haue in Grece ysou?th. ?eldeþ ?ou, for ?ee ben dede!’ And wiþ his spores smoot þe stede. His launces orde he gan hym bede, And smoot a riche prince of Mede— Herte and armes and sheldes boord He cleued a-two wiþ speres oord, And out of sadel cast hym, saun faile, Ouere croupe and horses tayle. Persanes weren y-armed wel On hei?e steden, in hard steel. Hij wiþstoden, wel defendynge, For hij weren twenty þousynde. Loude hij gunnen all[e] crye— Þere risen justes for þe maistrye. Þere was cleued many shelde, Kni?ttes yslawe, stedes a-felde, Cry and noyse and gradyng, Of stronge kni?ttes hard metyng. Tybery was an hardy man, And seeþ a prince, an Affrican, To men of Grece do mychel woo. He smoot his stede wiþ spores þoo— He hytt þat duk on þe breest. Þorou? shelde and breny his spere he þrest, And þorou? his lyuer and his entraile His sharp spere karf, saun faile. Þe duk fel of his stede þoo; His folk made mychel woo. Þe kyng of Capadoce ysau? þis, And smoot his gode stede, ywys. Of Grece he smoot a baroun Þat was yhote Menelaun, Þorou? þe garget and þorou? þe gorger— Þe kni?th fel ded of his destrer. Mark of Rome nabode no lenge; He slou? fyue on oo renge. Antigonus slou? Gildardyn, And Nepan, a stronge Sarsyn; Antigonus slou? þe duk Bardak, And Maudifas and ek Basak. Antigonus, þe hardy mareschale, Slou? Landagodon, þe admirale, And Audmas and Pharan (Jn Perce neren wi?tter men). Gaudyn þat was of Macedeyne Wiþ his swerd of Calleyne Slou? Byrel and Nazaran, And many anoþere Affrican. Ac Tholomeu, tofore hem alle, Loude on hei? he gan hem calle. Many he cleued in to þe sadel— He it biwepe þat lay in cradel. Þoo of Perce so gonne hem werie, And many of Grece dedly derie. Naþeles, also J fynde, Perciens loren seuen þousynde, And hij of Grece hundreþs þre. Vnder shelde hij gonne hem wrei?e; Vche on oþer so gan to legge Wiþ mace and wiþ swerdes egge, Þat it dyned so ri?th So on nayl dooþ þe ship-wri?th. Ac þoo of Grece þe barouns Fou?tten so don þe lyouns. Þoo of Perce alle arawe Gunnen fleen and hem wiþdrawe; Þe oþere hem dryuen, verreyment, To Darries ost wiþ hard dent. Of þe noyse þat hem askaped Al þat ost was awhaped, And gradden: ‘As armes, for Dons Mahouns! Lo, here of Grece þe barouns!’ From on to oþere þis cry was herd— Hij armed hem and girde wiþ swerd, And lopen on stedes wiþ styf baneres, And wiþ spores smyten her destrers. Þay of Grece sei?en þis— A gret queyntise hij duden, jwys: Looþ hem þou?th forto fleen— Hij undergaynden hem bitwen. Þre þousande of þoo comen Þat hij hadden ouercomen, To waterwardes wiþ swerdes egge; Þe oþere comen at her rygge. Þus hij flowen, oþere dryuynde, Al what hij comen, als J fynde, Þere hij er waren. Þoo wiþ corage Hij turneden a?ein her visage, Ac hij sei?en come Darries Perciens, Stronge Turgeys and Arabyens, Felle Escleirs and ek Mediens, And Capadoceys, and ek Suliens, Caldens, Ebreus, and Crettens, And Partiens and ek Albaniens, And Jndiens, and Emaniens. Al þis ysau? Tholomewe— A litel ruet a-loude he blewe. Gregeys alle stod grete doute, And Tholomew drowen aboute; Hij ben byshett þe water biside. Tholomew lete gon þe bride: He smyteþ a Percien wiþ þe spere— Þorou? þe herte he gynneþ hym bere. Also quyk he smyteþ anoþer (Jch vnderstonde it was his broþer) Þat he hym cleueþ þe bacyn— Þe dynt astood at his chyn. Hei?e men and her amyes For hem maden wel grete cryes, And Tholomew seide ‘So ho, so ho!’ We ben awroke of dogges two.’ Sir Dalma[da]s of Athenes Clepeþ his felawe, yhote Messenes, And Mark of Rome, and Antiochoun, And seiþ to hem, in hardy soun: ‘Lordynges,’ he seide, ‘it is nou?th to flen— We ben þe ost and þe water bitwen. Shame it ware, were we so feynt Þat we in þe water weren adreynt. Jt is better we to hem stoure, Als longe as we mowen endoure. Siwe me now who so wille— To Perciens J wil me selle.’ He dassheþ forþ so a dou?tty man, And smyteþ a duk Arabian, Þorou? shelde, and armes, lyuer, and lunge, And to þe deþ haþ hym stunge. Eueryche also of his peres Haþ anoþere on þat maners. Þis grete ost hereþ here-of speke, And hi?eþ hem to ben awreke. On þe Gregeys quyk hij dasshen, And fele of hem to deþ lasshen. Hij ne mowen þat assaut stonde, And flei?eþ a litel by þe stronde, And hem þere biradieþ bett, And gynneþ reme manlich flett. Þere hij holdeþ hem to-gidre, So flok of dere in þonder-wedre. Of Grece a gentyl kni?th of mounde Had on hym many wounde, And a trunchoun in his flaunche: He gan in to þe water launche. Vp he com at þe oþere syde— Tofore Alisaunder he gan ryde, Ri?th also he was arise (Of his woundyng he was agrise): ‘O Alisaunder, Philippes stren, ?if þou wilt Tholomeu sen, Gaudyn, Mark, and Antiochus, Þe duk Tyberie, and Antigonus, And þi noble duk Gregeys, Arme þee quyk, of maneys, And þine barouns; now hei?eþ bet, For al þe werlde hem haþ byshett! Þou mi?th ysee by my lere Þat Ich am trewe messagere.’ ‘As armes!’ was grad on hast— Sone y-armed was al þe ost. Þoo seide Alisaunder, wiþ voice hende: ‘Now shal Ich wite who is my frende!’ Hij hi?eden hem wel quyklich, Ac sarrelich and pryuelich. Þoo þat vpon þe watere fi?tt ?ut nyten hij nou?th of þis kni?t Þat haþ ybrou?th þe kyng tydyng, Ne forþe Alisaunders comyng. Men herden neuere of better fi?tters Better stonden ne better hem weres. None of hem neuere yswoned; Summe hadden þre, summe four wounde. Fele weren on fote and fele on hors, Wiþ meschief and kepten his corps. Alisaunder tofore is ride, And many a gentil kni?th hym myde, Ac forto gadre his meigne free He abideþ vnder a tree. Fourty þousande of chyualerie He takeþ in his compaignye. He dassheþ hym þan fast forþ-ward, And þe oþer comen afterward. He seeþ his kni?ttes in meschief— He takeþ it gretlich a-greef. He takes Bulcyphal by þe side; So a swalewe he gynneþ forþ glide. A duk of Perce sone he mett, And wiþ his launce he hym grett. He perceþ his breny, cleueþ his sheld; Þe herte tokerueþ þe yrne cheld. Þe duk fel doune to þe grounde, And starf quykly in þat stounde. Alisaunder a-loude þan seiede: ‘Oþere tol neuere Ich ne paiede! ?ut ?ee shullen of myne paie, Or Ich gon more assaie.’ Anoþer launce in honde he hent— A?ein þe prince of Tyre he went. He smoot hym þorou? þe breest þare, And out of sadel ouere croupe hym bare, And J sigge, for soþe þing, He braak his nek in þe fallyng. Oxeatre, wiþ mychel wonder, Antiochun hadde hym vnder, And wiþ swerd wolde his heued From his body habbe yreued. He sei? Alisaunder, þe gode gome, Towardes hym swiþe come— He lete his pray and flei? on hors, Forto saue his owen cors. Antiochus on stede lep. Of none woundes ne took he kep, And ek he had foure ford, Alle ymade wiþ speres ord. Tholomeus and alle hise felawen Of þis socour so weren wel fawen. Alisaunder made a cry hardy: ‘Ore tost, a ly! a ly!’ Þere þe kni?ttes of Achaye Justed wiþ hem of Arabye, Þoo of Rome wiþ hem of Mede— Many londe wiþ oþere þede. Egipte justed wiþ hem of Tyre, Symple kni?th wiþ riche syre. Þere nas fore?ift ne forberyng Bituene vauasoure ne kyng. Tofore men mi?tten and byhynde Cuntek seke and cuntek fynde. Wiþ Perciens fou?tten þe Gregeys. Þere roos cry and grete honteys! Hij kedden þat hij neren nice— Hij braken speres al to slice. Þere mi?th kni?th fynde his pere, Þere les many his destrere. Þere was quyk in litel þrawe Many gentil kni?th yslawe, Many arme, many heued Sone from þe body reued. Many gentil lauedy Þere lese quyk her amy. Þere was many maym yked, Many fair pensel bibled. Þere was swerdes liklakyng, Þere was speres baþing. Boþe kynges þere, saunz doute, Beeþ in dassht wiþ al her route, Þe on to don men of hym speke, Þe oþere his harmes forto wreke. Many londes, nei? and ferre, Lesen her lorde in þat werre. Þe erþe quaked of her rydyng; Þe weder þicked of her crieyng. Þe blood of hem þat weren yslawe Ran by flodes to þe lowe, And J ?ou sigge, sikerlich, Darrie fau?t wel dou?ttilich, And dude swiþe mychel woo. To on syde he drou?e hym þoo— He blew an horne quyk, saunz doute. His folk hym com swiþe aboute, And hem he seide, wiþ voice clere: ‘Jch bidde, frendes, þat ?e me here! Alisaunder is comen in þis londe, Wiþ stronge kni?ttes, wiþ mi?tty honde. ?if he passeþ wiþ honoure, Oure is al þe dishonoure. Jch am of Perce deshereted, Of Mede and Assire acquyted; Ac ?if þere is amonges vs Any kni?th so vertuous Þat Alisaunder mowe slen, We shullen parten vs bitwen Alle myne londes euen atwo. And ?ut he shal haue þerto Cristallyne, my dou?tter floure, And þorou? and þorou? half my tresoure.’ Non ne had flesshe so hardy Þat it hym durst ensury. Hij þou?tten þere-on, naþelas, ?if he mi?th come on cas Whare hij hym mi?th so hound abaye, Oiþer agilen oiþer atraye. Lorde Crist, what þis wordeles i?th Js leef to duk and to kni?th! Þere nys non so slowe wi?th jnne, And he wene mychel wynne, Þat he ne wolde for grete tresure Done hym-self in auenture. Amonge hem of Perce was a kni?th, Hardy, stalworþe, queynt, and wi?th. A kni?th of Grece sone he slou?, And his armes sone of-drou?, And quyk armed hym þere-inne, And nei?ed Alisaunder bi gynne. Alisaunder nou?th of hym shroof, Ac Perciens tofore hym droof. Somme he kytt of þe arme, Somme þe heued, and dude hem harme. He bad his folk fi?tten hard, Wiþ spere, mace, and wiþ swerd, And he wolde after fi?th Roume londes to hem di?th. Þis forseide kni?th ri?th hym by, Als it were his amy. Whan he Alisaunder besy seeþ— To Perciens sanchip deþ— He took a launce, so J fynde, And ri?th on Alisaunder byhynde. He smyteþ hym hard on þe hauberk, Þat was ymade of stronge werk. He helde fast—þe spere to-brast. Þe kyng was sumdel agast; He sat fast and loked a?an, And sey on armed as it were his man. ‘Fitz a puteyne!’ he seide, ‘lecchoure! Þou shalt sterue so a tretoure!’ ‘Certes,’ quoþ þe aliene kni?th, ‘J am no traitour—at al my mi?th J dude and engyned þee to slen, And ded þou haddest forsoþe yben, Ac auenture for þe fi?th: Þis victorie is þee ydi?th. Of Perce Ich am, fer of by est— Þis hardynesse J dude for a byhest, Þat Darrie bihete to whom þat mi?th Þee, kyng, slen in þis fi?th, He shulde haue half his kyng-riche, And his dou?tter, sikerliche. Þis was, kyng, al my chaysoun; Ne mi?ttou fynde her-jnne traysoun, Ac þat Ich me pylt in dedly cas, Forto habbe þat faire byhas.’ Þe kyng by þe chyn hym shook, And his sergeauntz hym [h]e tok, And bad hym loken in presoun. Nolde he hym slen bot by raysoun. He was ydo in gode warde, And bounden fast in bondes harde. Þe kyng brocheþ forþ Bulcyphal, And mette of Perce on admiral. He smyt hym þorou? body and shelde And cast hym ded in þe felde. Þere mi?th man in herte rewe Hou noble kni?ttes ouer-þrewe! Horses totraden alle þe boukes Of noble barouns and of dukes. Mede, and felde, hylle, and lawe Þick weren ystrewed of kni?ttes yslawe. Non ne see mi?th hem bitwen Who þat shulde maister ben. On boþe half wiþ swerd and spere Was ydon wel grete lere. Many is þat day faire kni?ttes slau?tt, Hors þorou?-corue, hauberk þorou?-rau?t, Many fair ei?e wiþ deþ yblent, And many soule to helle ywent. Þe day faile[þ], þe ni?th is ycome— Wery beþ þe gentyl gome. On boþe half þe mayne gentes We[n]ten hom to her tentes, And token rest al forto amorowe, Makande wel grete sorowe For her lordes, for her ken, Þat layen yslawe in þe fen. Alisaunder arisen is, And on his deys sitteþ, jwys. His dukes and his barouns, saunz doute, Stondeþ and sitteþ hym aboute. He hete brynge forþ þat felawe Þat hym wolde haue yslawe. He is ybrou?th, and þe kyng Gynneþ hym ?iue swiche acusyng: ‘Þou’ he seide, ‘als a traitoure ?ister-day com in oure atoure, Y-armed wel as on of myne, Me bihynde at my chyne, And smoot me wiþ þi spere. Ne had myne hauberk ben þe strongere, Þou haddest me vilely yslawe! Þou shalt ben honged and to-drawe, And forbrent al to nou?th, For þou swiche traisoun þou?th!’ ‘Sir!’ quoþ þe Percien kni?th, ‘?if ?ee me don law?e and ri?th, Ne worþe Ich to-drawe ne anhonge, For it were al wiþ wronge. Darrie bihete to vche of his To make pere to hym, jwis, Who þat mi?th þe ywynne, Oiþer wiþ gyle oiþer wiþ gynne. Darrie was my ri?th lorde— Jch fonded to don his worde, His foo to quelle on vche manere, And of traisoun me wil J skere. ?if any man wil oþere proue, Loo, here a?eins hym þe gloue!’ Antiochus seide: ‘Þou ne mi?th þe skere, For þou hast demed þi-self here, Þoo þou for mede and bihotyng Stale byhynden on oure kyng, Hym to slen so þeefliche! Brende þou shalt ben openliche! Þou shalt sterue on swiche deþ hard— Þe dome Ich ?iue to award.’ Tholomeus þe mareschal vp stood, Wi?th in bataile, in conseil good, And seide: ‘Þe kyng may don his wille— Sauen þat Percien, oiþer hym spille; Ac he ne haþ no ri?th chesoun, For he ne dude no tresoun. His dede ne was bot honest, For he dude his lordes hest. Euery man to slen his foo Dyuers gynne so shal do. For his lorde (nymeþ gode cure!) He dude his lyf on auenture. He nas nou?th sworne to my lorde, Bot wiþ swerd and speres orde— Leeflich it is to euery foo Hou so he may oþer sloo. ?ee mowen to wille brenne and honge, Ac Ich sigge it were wiþ wronge!’ Up stood Sir Mark of Rome, And entremeted of þis dome: ‘Certes’, he seide, ‘[he dude] wou?, Þat he a kny[?]t of Grece slou?, And despoiled hym of his armes, By traisoun, and to oure harmes, And joyned hym vs among, Als on of vs—al þis was wrong— And so stale on oure kyng, Hym to brynge to his endyng. J jugge he shal anhonged be. Barouns of court, what seie ?ee?’ Eueryche seide: ‘He shal be slawe, Forbrent, anhonged, and todrawe!’ Non ne spaak hym on word fore, Bot þat he shulde be forlore. Þoo Alisaunder sei? al þis, Yhereþ what he dude, jwis! Jt is ywrite þat euery þing Hym-self sheweþ in þe tastyng. So it is of lewed and clerk— Hym-self sheweþ in his werk. Þe kyng seeþ þat no kni?th hende Nylle more þat Percien defende, And seiþ: ‘Kni?th, he were wood Þat wolde þee don ou?th bot good! Trayson þou ne dedest ne feyntise, Ac hardy dede in grete queyntise. For þat dede, by myne hood, Ne shaltou haue bot good!’ Richelich he dooþ hym shrede Jn spannewe kni?tten wede, And sette hym vpon an hei?e chaceoure, And ?af hym mychel of his tresoure, And lete hym to Darrie wende hom— Ne ?af he hym non oþer dom. Mery it is in þe day graukynge, Whan þe foules gynneþ synge, And jolyf herte so gynneþ sprynge. To sone it þencheþ þe slow gadelynge! Jn mychel loue is grete mournynge; Jn mychel nede is grete þankynge. A ferly þou?th is wiþ þe kyng— Erly he riseþ, and makeþ boost, And hoteþ quyk armen al þe ost. Hij ben y-armed quyklich, And alle hym siweþ, sikerlich, Ouer a water, in to a forest, And alle don quyk her lordes hest— Bow?es of dyuers trees hij kytten, And to her horses tales knytten. To Darrie ward alle hij fareþ; Þe bow?es þe dust hei?e arereþ. Of þe draweyng of bow?es and stykke Þe eyre bicom trouble and þicke, Þat to Darries folk it ferde, Als on hem com þe myddelerde. Quyklich hij telden it Darrie, And baden hym he shude hym wardie, For Alisaunder com wiþ his preye— His folk wrei? al þe contreye. Darrie hete alle his men Remuen his tentes of þe fen, And setten hem bisides Estrage (A colde water and a sauage). A castel he had vpon þe ryue— Nas non strenger in þis lyue. Quyk was al Darries ost Yloged Estrages acost. Þere hij wolden fonden aspye Al Alisaundres felonye. Alisaunder þis tellen herd, And after wiþ his ost ferd, And alle hem logeden an-ouen-on Þere Darrie had ben arst vpon. Now is ywryen al þe contreie. Bitwene hem is foure myle weye— Often þere was bitwene ridynge, Many awayt and bataillynge. Þerwhiles of Alisaunder þe kyng Lestneþ now a selcouþ þing! Jn a morowen-tyde it was, Þat dropes hongen on þe gras, And maidens loken in þe glas, Forto atyffen her faas. Kyng Alisaunder is out yride— Þre noble kni?ttes ben went hy[m] myde, Pryuelich, in one myst (His grete ost it ne wist). He dooþ þoo þre in sooþ treuþe Pli?tten to hym her treuþe Þat hij ne shullen hym biwreye Of þing þat he wil to hem seie. Hij dooþ his wille—he gynneþ hem telle Þat he wil wende, swiþe snelle, Forto see þe countenaunce Of Darries court, saunz demurraunce. No kni?th ne roode þoo wiþouten stede, Ne wiþouten yrnen wede. To þe water hij comen ri?th— Of his stede þe kyng ali?th, And of-dude al his armure, And dude on a robe wiþ pelure. Vpon a palfray he leep, And seide: ‘Kni?ttes, ?iueþ kep To Bulciphal my destrere, And abideþ me ri?th here. Jch wil come whan J maye.’ Quyk he dooþ hym in þe waye. Þe þre kni?ttes of whom J seide (Þe on hi?th Aymes of Archade, Þe oþere hi?th Philotas, And þe þrid hi?th Perdicas— Þere neren better kni?ttes þree Jn al þe kynges meignee) Þise Alisaunder so willen abide, Wel y-armed, by þe water-syde. Now sytt Darrie on an hylle, Þe folk of his ost for to telle. Alisaunder comeþ on hym skeet, And seiþ þat ‘Kyng Alisaunder þee gret! He is comen to parlement, Forto ?elde þee þi rent. Twies he haþ þee ouercome, Þi wijf and þine childre ynome; Fele þou hast yslawe of his. He sente þee siggen þus, jwis— Jt shal be wel dere abou?th, Þe tol þat was in Grece sou?th. Greiþes armes, ?arkes sheldes! He ?ou abideþ in þe feldes.’ Darrie was wel sore anoyede Of þat Alisaunder had hym seid, And seide: ‘Of tale þou art smart! Alisaunder þi-self þou art.’ And Alisaunder seide: ‘It is nou?th so! He is whitter, wiþouten no, And his lockes beeþ nou?th so crulle, Ac he is waxen more to þe fulle. Ac Ich am hoten Antigon, Þat many message haue hym ydon.’ Darrie seide: ‘Messagere, ali?tte! And gowe eten onon-ri?tte, And after mete þou shalt bere To þi lorde a?ein ansuere.’ Darrie to mete ?ede onon, Wiþ his barouns euerychon. Alisaunder, wiþouten fable, He setteþ at his owen table. Hij weren yserued wiþ grete plente, Wiþ fresshe and salt, of vche deynte, And dronken wyne and ek pyement, White and red, at her talent. Þere weren coupes riche ywrou?th, And Alisaunder hym biþou?th Hou he mi?th do sum þing Of to speke wiþouten endyng. Þe kyng to hym of a coupe drank, And he it afenge wiþ mychel þank, And drank after þat wyne rede, And putte þe coupe vnder his grede (Þe coupe was of rede golde). Þe boteler it haþ al byholde, And telleþ Darrie al þe soþ, And he bicom ri?th fyne wroþ, And seiþ: ‘Haue he don me þat shonde, Men shullen speke, of Grece londe, Of þe vengeaunce þat he shal þole And he haue my c[o]p ystole!’ Þe boteler takeþ vp his grede, And fyndeþ þe coupe of golde rede. Darrie to Alisaunder gan sigge: ‘Eye! vile þeef, þou shalt abygge! J sette þee at tabel myne, For reuerence of lorde þyne. Myne coupe þou haste ystole, And vnder þine grede yhole! Þou art ynome honde-habbynde— Þou shalt quyk honge in þe wynde!’ Quoþ Alisaunder þe kyng, so hende: ‘Of þeft Ich wil me defende, A?eins kni?t, a?eins baroun, Þat J was neuere no laroun. J com ri?th on my lordes message, And wende ?ee hadden al swiche vsage As haþ my lorde in court his, For þi richesse and for þi prys, Þat þou hast oþer tofore. Bot þat honour þou hast forlore; For sende þere kyng oiþer kaysere To my lorde a messagere, And he be worþi, saunz fable, He shal sytte at his table, And whan þe kyng hym krynkeþ to, Þe coupe he shal at his wille vp do! Jch wende ?ee vseden also here Of oure court þe manere— J me repent, siþen ?ee ne dooþ; For qued ne dude Ich it nou?th, for sooþ.’ Darrie, þou? he were agramed, Of his ansuere he was ashamed. Stille seten ?onge and elde And fast bygonnen hym byhelde. A kni?th þere was þat hi?th Parsage Þat Alisaunder knew in þe visage, For he had ben in message At Kyng Phelippe for trowage— He seiþ it Darrie vnder his hood. Wel Alisaunder it vnderstood. Jt ran in Alisaunders corage Þat qued of hym rouned Persage, And þat he to Darrie of hym spaak. Ouer þe table he lep, gode rak— Quyk in his waye he hym di?th, And Darrye after, wiþ al his mi?th. A swerd Alisaunder had, cert, Þat was to hym fast girt; Out he it braided in his honde. Non wolde in his waye stonde. He meteþ a kni?th wiþ a speruere, As God wolde, on a destrere. He took hym swiftly in þe swire, Þat he leide his heued to hire. He shoof hym quyklich adoune, And lep hym-self in to þe arsoune. He smoot þe stede and he forþ glyt, And Alisaunder quyk away rytt— Þat day ne shullen hij hym atake! Darrie gynneþ after rake; Prynce and duk, kni?th, and sweyn, Dasshen after wiþ grete meyn. Euerychone hij don for nou?th— Alisaunder haþ þat water cau?th. Jt was brood and hi?th Estrage— Depe stremes and swift o rage. He smoot þe hors and it jn lep; Jt was swift, brood, and dep. Hors and kyng, wiþ alle his hater, Weren a met-?erd vnder þe water. Alisaunder tofore ne seeþ— Was sore adrad of his deþ. Narþeles his hors was good, And keuered vp abouen þe flood, And swam to þe oþer syde, Þere his kni?ttes hym deden abyde. Hij holpen hym vp and his stede, And quyk chaungeden his wede, And ?ut he had þe coupe on honde Þat he on Darries table fonde. To his ost he fareþ, gode skoure, And telleþ hem his auenture. Þe ?onge þere-of hadden game; Þe elde wise it nomen agrame, And seiden wel þat swiche cas Of woodhede and foly was. Darrie haþ ylore his praye— For sorou? nei? he wil daye. Was hym neuere er so woo, For he haþ ylore his foo. A?ein wenden lesse and more, And bymeneþ his skape sore. Ni?th it is—hij takeþ rest. Amorowe ariseþ newe gest. Day-spryngynge is jolif tyde. He þat can his tyme abide, Often hym shal his wille bitide. Looþ is gentil-man to chide. Alisaunder dooþ cryen wyde His loges setten on þe water-syde. Quyk þan was ydon his hest— Þere was many tente honest; Many gentil tente stood Bisiden-honde þe water brood. Þe kyng haþ sett out his dragoun, And on his tente a golde lyoun, And eueryche baroun on his tente Riche baneres and pensels gente. Darrie it woot by a spye— Amonge his barouns he dooþ crie: ‘As armes, as armes, euerychon! And slee we doun-ri?th oure fon. Who-so faileþ at þis nede, Mote he neuere on erþe wel spede!’ Þe knaues graiþen her hors and shrubben, And þe kni?ttes her bodyes dubben; Þe waites blowen, þe belles rynge. Darrie makeþ ten bataillynge— Jn eueryche bataile tuenty þousynde Wel di?th kni?ttes, als J fynde. Hij don hem forþ þe cuntree to wren, So þat hem mowen her fon seen. Ne mowen he fordward, saunz faile, Wel to don wiþouten bataile. Mercy, Jesu! þou vs socoure! Jt fareþ wiþ man so dooþ wiþ floure— Bot a stirte ne may it dure; He glyt away so dooþ þe[ss]ure. Fair is lefdy in boure, And also kni?th in armoure. Two hundreþ þousande ben in Darries ost; Amonge hem was pride and mychel bost. Alisaunder it seeþ, saunz fable, And clepeþ to hym his ten conestable, Antioche of Ostage, And Gaudyn, and Aymer of Arcade, Tyberie, Julie, and Perdicas (Þise weren gode in euery plaas) Tholomeu þe mareschal, and Clitoun, Mark, and Permenio, þe gode baroun, And bad non habbe þat rage Þe water to passe of Estrage, For who so passed, kni?th or grom, He shulde þole þe deþes dom. Ac eueryche a?ein shulde reme, Als hij hadden taken fleme: ‘For ?if Darrye of Perce lorde Passeþ wiþ his ost þis f[or]de, He shal be cutted als an ape! Oure honde ne shal he neuere skape, Ne non ost a?eins vs Gadren more so vertuous.’ Hij drowen hem quyk vnder a lowe, Als hij hadden alle yflowe. Hij setten on fyre her tentes, And on londe hem drou?, verrayment. Salome þe smeek say— He gan make grete disray. He grad wel on hei? to Darrye: ‘Sir, þou mi?th Mahoun herye! Þe Gregeys habbeþ her loges barnd And beþ for vs away arnd. Quyk, quyk, passe we þis lake! Þe cowardes fonde we atake, And tocleuen her rygge Wiþ oure sharp swerdes egge!’ Quyk he smyteþ ouere þe foord— Kni?th and swayn tofore lorde, Ouer hij dasshen euerychon, And priken fast after her fon. Hij wenden þat hij weren yflowe— Nay! hij hem fonden, to her howe! Þoo Alisaunder hem ouer hadd: ‘?ee beeþ traitours!’ onon he gradd, ‘Aly!’ he seide, ‘Aly, blyue! Ne leteþ skape non alyue!’ He smoot Persage þat hym bywreyed— Þe spere was styf and nou?th ne beyed. He carf his herte and his pomoun, And þrew hym ouere his arsoun, And seide: ‘Lye þare, vile beye! Shaltou neuere efte kyng biwreye.’ Þere roos swiche cry, verrayment, Ne shulden men here þe þonder-dent. Þe dust so roos hem bituen Þat men ne mi?th þe sonne seen. Þere was many swerd out drawe; Þere was many kni?th yslawe. Salome dooþ þe Gregeys gret sore— Wiþ spere he sleeþ Sir Nichanore. Jn Grece neren better þree— Permeniones son so was he. Philotas þat vnderstood— Colde and drery was his blood. His swerd he bare in honde ydrawe, Wiþ whiche he had many yslawe. On his heued he smoot wiþ egge Þat he hym cleueþ to þe rygge; Ded he is of sadel yfalle. Þe Perciens it bewepeþ alle; Also Gregeys for Nichanore Jn herte habbeþ mychel sore. Oxeatre seeþ Salome yslawe (He was Darries broþer-in-lawe; He hadde wedded Romidas, Darries suster þe kyng þat was). He was hardy man and stronge, And took a launce styf and longe. He smoot Helan, of Mede a duk, Ouer þe nauel, þorou? þe bouk. Þe spere tobrast, þe duk doun fel. Þre he sleeþ wiþ swerd þertyl— Nepon, and ek Pharitouns, And Godalan, þre riche barouns. Þe twoo were of Grece ybore amyd; Of Egipte was þe þrid. Þis was to Grece a sory fal. Þat sei? Tholomeu þe mareschal— He took in honde a rede pensel, Wiþ a soket of broun stel. Oxeatre on þe shelde he girte; He perced his armes and his herte, And þe pensel riche and good Baþed in Oxeatres blood. Tholomeu hym seide snelle: ‘Ne shaltou more Gregeys quelle! Oxeatre, þou hast abou?th Þe tol þat was at Grece sou?th!’ Dariadas, Darries broþere, He haþ sleyn on and oþere: Tauryn and Hardas he slou? wiþ spere; Wiþ swerd Rodyn he dude amere, And in þis stronge fi?ttyng cas He haþ mett wiþ Dalmadas. Þere þou mi?ttest see two kni?ttes Dou?ttilich togedre fi?th, Wiþ schelde wrei?en, wiþ swerd assaile. Bituene hem was stronge bataile, Ac atte last Dalmadas Wan þe heued of Dariadas. Wel smyteþ Persan, wel smyteþ Gregeys; So dooþ Romayn and Tuskaneys. Þe speres crakeþ also þicke So on hegge sere stykke. Þere les childe and ek lefdy Her fader and her amy, Damoysels her lemman, Þe man his lorde, þe lorde his man. Myllen mi?tten by þe blood Grynden corne as by þe flood. Twenty milen wayes and mo Ne mi?tten men a stride go, Bot men stepped on ded men, Jn dale, in doune, in felde, in fen. Archelaus in þe fi?ttyng Mette wiþ Alisaunder þe kyng. Wiþ a spere he hym gerte, Ac he braak a?eins his herte. Þat hauberk was ymade so wel Þat þere-inne ne mi?th entre þe steel. Ac Alisaunder hym hytt bett Ri?th a?eins þe herte pytt, Þat þe spere carf þorou?-out As þorou? a wollene clout, And cast hym ouer þe stede croupe. Þo gan Darrie forto droupe— Þousandes of his he seeþ hym aboute, Ac non of hem was wounde wiþoute. Slawen weren his frendes of mounde, And leyen dede vpon þe grounde. His men hym comen aboute flynge Forto habbe of hym helpynge. Summe ben lamed and al to-clouted, Summe her guttes hongen oute, And Alisaunder on vche half Sleeþ doune-ri?th so dooþ a raged wolf. For mychel sorou? he warþe so woo Þat his herte brast nei? in two. He smoot þe stede wiþ þe spore And flei? away as man forlore; And whan þe hede is yflowe Þe maynee is in mychel howe. Eueryche fondeþ by vche halue Of Darries folk to saue hem-selue, And flei?eþ hider and þider by eueryche weye, And sechen quyk diuers contreye. Alisaunder wel many astauncheþ; Þe most part hym-self adrencheþ. Þis chace lasted to þe ni?th, And Alisaunder þoo to rest ti?th. Darrie þe kyng is yflowe Toward Babiloyne, wiþ howe. Jn to a castel he entreþ þare Þat was ycleped Melonare. Als sone as he was ali?th, A-swowe he fel to grounde ri?th. Ne sei? man neuere man ne kyng Make so mychel mournyng— F[or] Oxeatre and Darriadas He gradde ‘Wele-away!’ and ‘Allas!’ For Archelaus and Salome, And for his oþer pryue meignee, He made so mychel woo and reuþe, Ne may Ich telle it al in treuþe. Naþeles þoo he of swowe cam, Conseil of his princes he nam, And sent to Alisaunder a wrytt Þat þus seide (now hereþ it): ‘[T]o Alisaunder þe stronge kyng, Of alle caisers maisterlyng, Darrie, þat was emperoure, Sendeþ gretyng, par amoure! Gentyl sir, in myne sorowen Forbereþ me a fewe morowen! For a?eins þee ne habbe Ich vigoures. Ded ben myne princes a[nd] almacoures. Pouer me haþ made auenture Alle [?oure hy?h streynþe to] honoure. Jch ?iue ?ou Mede, wiþ-outen assoyne, Þe toures and cites of Babiloyne, Tyre and Nynyuen and Panphile, And in to Ynde ten skore myle, My richesse and myne tresoures— Alle þat hadden myne antecessoures. Nille Ich here bileue, saunz faile, Ac flen in to þe londe of trauaile, And þere libbe in pyne and sorou?, Wiþ þi from deþ ?ee me borou? And for?iue me ?oure yuel wille, And nou?th for þis trespas me spille.’ Kyng Alisaunder haþ vnderstonde Þe lettre þat com from Darries sonde. Wroþ he was, and hadde pyte, Ac for his gret auctorite He nolde quyk ?iue ansuere, And þat fel Darrie to lyues lere. Þe messagers hom gonne gon And ne brou?tten ansuere non. Þoo helde hym Darrie bicau?t, Þat he had his foo bisau?t. He sent message to Porous, Þe kyng of Ynde, and ek salous— Pleyned hou Alisaunder, par maistrie, Hadde hym ouercomen þrie, Taken his londes, slayn his frende, And bisou?th hym, als he was hende— To vche man on hors ?iue he wolde Fyue mark of rede golde, And þai on fote shulden haue þre, And don he wolde hym feute— ‘And habben hij shullen, naþeles, Al her wynnyng and purchas, And J þe bihote, by my leys, Bulciphal wiþ his herneys, Þat better is þan a þousande mark (Ne can his worþe descryue clerk). And Ich al þat Ich euere welde By trew[e] of þee Ich wil helde.’ Whiles þe messageres weren to Porus ward, To Darrie fel chaunce hard. He had norisshed traitours two Jn his court, and so habbeþ mo. Þat on was cleped Besas, And also þat oþere Besanas. Þai comen and her lorde biwreyeden, And to Alisaunder seiden Hou Darrie had ysent to Ynde After folk many þousynde. From [Assire] and Ethiope bo Hym shulde come poeple also, And ?iuen he wolde kyng Porus Bulciphal, þe stede precious. Kyng Alisaunder first had yment Hym haue for?ouen his mautalent, And wolde hym wiþ grete honoure Habbe affonge in his amoure. Now he is strongelich on hym wrooþ, And haþ yswore his grete ooþ Þat he ne shal twies seen þe sonne Ar he hem haue par force ywonne. He hoteþ his folk al to bataile, And þe castel onon assaile. Þise two traitoures gon tofore And siggen to Darrie he is ylore, For Alisaunder wil er ni?th Breken þe castel doune-ri?th, And nymen [hym] by quyk vigoure, For [he] ha[þ] sent after socoure. Þo was Darrie sore agast, And sent out his folk on hast, His pryue meigne, forto fi?th, Whiles he mi?th hymseluen di?th. Hij weren out and ful wel fou?tten, For of lyue hem ne rou?tte. Darrie þerwhiles stale away, By a posterne, a pryue way. Nyst noman his doleful cas Bot Besas and Besanas. Þise riden by his syde— Yuel chaunce hem mote bityde! Her aiþer wiþ a sharp spere Her lorde bygonnen þorou?-bere, And casten doun þe gentyl cors Jn þe poudre of his hors. Away hij gonnen fleen and fare, Als it hij neuer nare. Fundelynges weren þai two Þat her lorde bisei?en so. Þerfore ne shulde no gentil kni?th Neuere norissh no founden wi?th, Ne beggers blood brynge in hei?e wyke, Bot he wolde hym-seluen biswyke. Darrie lijþ now on þe grounde, And in his body two deþes wounde. His folk was sone in þat medleye By strengþe dryuen eueryche weye. Alisaunder, in his disraye, Fynt Darrie lien in þe poudraye. Quik he li?tteþ of his hors, And takeþ in his armes þat gentil cors. Darrie seeþ þe kyng it is, And on his knowe he sytt vp, jwis. To hym he ioyneþ his honden tweie, Also wel as he maye, And seiþ: ‘Gentil sir, here my cry— On me þat þou haue mercy, And graunte me swiche beri?ing Als afereþ to a kyng. Ne take þou neuer wreche non On synful flesshe and on bon, Bot beri?e me by kynges law?e, And lete non houndes me todrawe Ne no tygre ne no lyoun, J þe biseche, gentyl baroun. J þe biqueþe, by my lijf, To þi spouse my gentil wijf. To ?ou and hir, and to ?oure honours, J biqueþe alle myne tresoures.’ And for nou?th was þat seying, For he starf at þe first tydyng. ‘Sir,’ he seide, ‘Kepe childr[e] myne, As afereþ to honoure þine. Mede and Perce J þe biqueþe. Ne may Ich lenger libbe for deþe, Ne so longe ne had Ich dured Ne had ?ee me þus honured. My spirit haþ hadd vertu And lijf þus longe, for joye of ?ou. Mercy!’ seide þat emperoure gent, And wiþ þat word þe spirit out went. Ac þe doel þat Alisaunder made Ne may Ich neuere ful-rade. Darrie starf in his armes two. Lorde, what Alisaunder was wo! He wryngeþ his hondes for hym, saunz faile. Often he crieþ and often gynneþ waile; He wolde al Perce habbe y?iue And he mi?th haue had his lyue. Þat euere hateden hem so fendes, Now hij ben in deþ frendes. Alisaunder his cloþes taar And todrou? his ?elewe haar. His gentil-folk aboute hym come, And hym from þe cors nome, And conforted in faire manere, And amendeden his chere. Pes he dude onon grede To al Darries manrede. Þat body he led to Assire, And gentillich dude hym atyre. Þe boweles weren ynomen out And forbrent, wiþouten doute. Þe body was bawmed and leide in shryne Of entaile riche and fyne. Alle his frendes, pouer and riche, Weren þere, sikerliche. Richeliker ne wiþ more werþe Nas neuere kni?th brou?th on erþe. Þoo he was beri?ed wiþ grete honoure, He name Darries riche tresoure, And parted it among his ken And among his owen men. Of hem alle he fenge feute And seruise and ek leute. What wiþ ?ifte, what wiþ queyntise, Alle he wan hem to his seruyse. His two dou?ttren—two swetynges— He mari?ed hem to riche kynges. His wijf starf atte first tydyng— Fair on herþe he dude hir bryng. His moder he dude kepe so hende Fair to hir lyues ende. Whan he had ystabled þe lay, Þus he seide vpon a day: ‘Mi?th Ich wyte who it ware Þat Darie þorou? wiþ spere bare And slow?en hym wiþ dubble dent, Al for myne auauncement, Jch wolde auauncen her corps, And setten hem on hei?e hors, And ?iuen hem stole and baudry, As men don þe kynges amy— Leden hem þe cite aboute, And don þe folk to hem loute.’ Þoo þe traitours herden þis, Hij wenden keueren honour, jwis. Hij stirten forþ, and weren biknowe Hou hij hadden Darrie yslawe, And hou hij slowen her kynde lorde; And kyng Alisaunder held his word— He dude quyk herneysen hors, And setten þere-on her cors. Hynt-anforþ hij seten, saunz fail, And hadden in her honde þe tail. Of pese-bu?th was her coroune. Hij waren led aboute þe toune; A wiþþe was her stole, cert, And wiþ an oþere hij weren girt. As men hem ladden aboute þe toun, Men shewed þat folk her traisoun. Men hem þrew wiþ drytt and dunge, Wiþ foule ayren, wiþ roþeres lunge. Þoo þis despyt hem was ydo, Her feet men knytten þe horses to, And to þe gibet quyk hem tare; Hei?e hij weren anhonged þare. Þus ended þe traytour Besas And þe traytour Besenas. Þe deuel of helle hem mote stike, Vche traitour þat his lorde biswike! From pryuees may noma[n] hym warie, And þat ?ee seen wel by Darye— His owen norryes to deþ hym brou?th. Sore yt my?tte hem rewe in her þou?th; For clerkes siggeþ in her writyng Traisoun haþ yuel endyng. Now ?ee moten vnderstonde Hou Alisaunder sercheþ þe londe, Makeþ his baillifs and his justises, Takeþ feute and ek seruises. Þoo þat weren Darries frende Louen hym wiþ herte hende, For þe honoure after his lijf He dude to hym and to his wijf, And for þe vengeaunce of Besas Þat he dude, and to Besanas. Al aboute þe proude riche He adaunted quykliche, And makeþ pes maugre to eche— Dar noman a?ein hym queche. Faire ben tales in compaignye; Mery in chirche is melodye. Yuel may þe slow hye, And wers may blynde blynde siweye. Who þat haþ trewe amye Joliflich may hym [disgy]e. Jch woot þe best is Marye— She vs shilde from vilenye! Nov agynneþ þe oþere partye Of Alisaunders dedes hardye— Hou he wan al Ynde londe, Ethiope, and ek Bramunde, Albanye, and Taprobaunce, And þe grete ydles of Meraunce, Hou he bishett Taurunceys Wiþ pilers of bras and butumeys, And two and twenty regiouns, Alle menbrette naciouns; Hou he had many batailles, Wiþ wormes, and oþere merueilles; Hou he slou? Porus in þe place, Hou he was giled of Candace. Of selkouþ trowes, of selkouþ beeste— Al ?ou shal telle þe oþere gest. Þoo Alisaunder went þorou? desert, Many wondres he sei? apert, Whiche he dude wel descryue By gode clerkes in her lyue— By Aristotle, his maister þat was. Better clerk siþen non nas— He was wiþ hym, and sei? and wroot Alle þise wondres, God it woot. Salomon, þat al þe werlde þorou?-?ede, Jn sooþ witnesse helde hym myde. Ysidre also, þat was so wijs, Jn his bokes telleþ þis. Maister Eustroge bereþ hym witnesse Of þe wondres, more and lesse. Seint Jerome, ?ee shullen ywyte, Hem haþ also in book ywrite, And Magestene þe gode clerk Haþ made þerof mychel werk. Denys, þat was of gode memorie, Jt sheweþ al in his book of storie. And also Pompie, of Rome lorde, Dude it writen euery worde. Ne heldeþ me þerof no fynder— Her bokes ben my shewer, And þe lijf of Alisaunder, Of whom flei? so riche sklaunder. ?if ?ee willeþ ?iue listnyng, Now ?ee shullen here gode þing. Jn somers tyde þe day is long— Foules syngeþ and makeþ song. Kyng Alisaunder ywent is, Wiþ dukes, erles, and folk of pris, Wiþ many kni?th and dou?tty men, Toward þe cite of Facen, After kyng Porus, þat flowen was Jnto þe cite of Ba[u]das. He wolde wende þorou? desert, Þise wondres to seen apert. Gyoures he name of þe londe— Fyue þousande, J vnderstonde— Þat hem shulden lede ri?th Þorou? desert, by day and ni?th. Þe gyoures loueden þe kyng nou?th, And wolden haue hym bicau?th. Hij ledden hym þerfore, als J fynde, Jn þe straungest peryl of Ynde. Ac, so Ich fynde in þe book, Hij weren asshreynt in her crook. Now rideþ Alisaunder wiþ his ost, Wiþ mychel pride and mychel boost. Ac ar hij comen to castel oiþer toun Hij shullen speken anoþere lessoun. Lordynges, also J fynde, At Mede so bigynneþ Ynde. Forsoþe, Ich woot, it streccheþ ferrest, Of alle þe londes in þe est, And o þe souþhalf, sikerlyk, To þe cee takeþ of Affryk, And þe norþ half to a mountayne Þat is ycleped Caucasayne. Forsoþe, ?ee shullen vnderstonde, Twyes is somer in þe londe, And neuermore wynter ne chele. Þat londe is ful of al wele— Twyes hij gaderen fruyt þere, And wyne, and corne, in one ?ere. Jn þe londe, als J fynde, of Ynde, Ben cites fyue þousynde, Wiþouten ydles, and castels, And borughus, tounes, swiþe feles. Jn þe londe of Ynde þou mi?th lere Nyne þousynde folk of selcouþ manere, Þat þer non is oþer yliche. Ne helde þou it nou?th ferlich! Ac by þat þou vnderstonde þe gestes, Boþe of men and ek of beestes, Þat vs telleþ þe maistres, saunz faile, Þan mi?th þou haue merueile. Lete we now Alisaunder in pays ride, And speke we of wondres þat ben biside. Listneþ of wondres, and sitteþ in pes! Jn Ynde is a water yhote Ganges; Þere ben jnne fysshes of strengþe— Þre hundreþ feet hij ben of lengþe. Jn þat water an ydle is, And in þat ydle tounes of prys. To bataile may þe kyng of þat ydle Wiþ foure and fifty þousande men ride— Foure þousande on hors of prijs, And þe oþer ben fote-men, jwys. Þere is anoþer ydle hatt Gangerides; Þere ben jnne castels and of poeple pres. Hij beeþ also mychel and belde As childe of seuen ?eres elde— Hij ne ben nomore, verreyment; Ac hij ben of body faire and gent. Hij ben naþeles faire and wi?th, And gode and engyneful to fi?th, And haue horses auenaunt To hem, stalworþe and asperaunt. Clerkes hij ben wiþ þe best— Of alle men hij ben queyntest; And euermore hij beþ werrende And vpon oþer conquerrende. By þe mone and by þe sterren Hij connen iugge alle werren. Hij ben þe alþer-best Þat ben from est in to west, For hij connen shete þe gripes flei?eyng, And þe dragons þat ben brennyng. Hij ben in wode gode hunteres To lacche bores and wilde beres, And ek lyouns and olyfaunz. Þe kyng of þise sergeaunz May leden to bataille Two þousande kni?ttes, saunz faille, And seuen hundreþ olifaunz, And fourty þousande redy sergeaunz. Nou?th f[e]r þan so is Polibote; Þe men of þe cuntreie ben yhote. Hij ben fyne hardy men and wi?th, And mychel connen of werre and fi?th. Þe kyng of þat ydle may, saunz faile, Þritty þousande on hors lede to bataile, And sex hundreþ on fote-folk (non better shetynde!) And olyfaunz y-armed ei?tt þousynde. Riche ben þe ydles of Yndes cuntreye. Alisaundres hardynesse may noman seye, Þe whiche, oiþer bi strengþe or elles by sum gynne, Al þat he seeþ þencheþ forto wynne. Mjchel is þe wonder þat is vnder Crist Jesus! Þere bi?onden is an hylle is cleped Malleus. Listneþ nov to me, J praie for my loue. Þis hylle is so hei? þat noþing comeþ aboue. Þe folk on þe north half in þester stede hij beþ, For in al þe ?er no sunne hij ne seeþ. Hij on þe souþ half ne seen sonne non, Bot in on moneþ, atte fest of Seint John. Þoo þat woneþ in þe est partie, Þe sonne and þe hote skye Al þe day hem shyneþ on, Þat hij ben blak so pycches fom. Þise naciouns ben outelyng, And in her owen ?emyng. Pandea is a land fast þere-biside— Þere-inne is jolifte, curteisie, and pride. Alle hij ben maydens þat þere-inne woneþ; Mannes compaignye, certes, hij shoneþ. Þe quene of her londe so is A damoysel of mychel prys. Faire and wel þise damoysels Lokeþ her cites and her castels. Þe quene may lede to hire baners Twenty þousande maidens vpon destrers, Þat conne on felde wel shake a spere And stronge kni?ttes out of her sadles bere. A folk woneþ biside þoos Þat beeþ ycleped Faraugos, Þat haunteþ wildernesse and forestes, And nymeþ þere-inne wilde bestes, And flesshe hij eten raw and hoot, Wiþouten kycchen, God it woot. Anoþer folk hem woneþ by Þat beþ yhoten Maritiny. By þe water is her wonynge, And hij libben al by fysshynge. Hij nymeþ þe fyssh and eteþ it þanne, Wiþouten fyre, wiþouten panne. Ne habben hij non oþer fyre Bot shynyng of þe sonne clere. Anoþer folk þere is next, as hogges crepeþ— After crabben and acren hij skippen and lepeþ. Of þornes and busshes ben her garnement, And of holinen leues, J sigge verrayment. Anoþer folk woneþ þere-biside— Orphani hij hatteþ wyde. Whan her eldrynges beþ elde, And ne mowen hem-seluen welde, Hij hem sleeþ and bidelue, Ac þe guttes hij eteþ hem-selue. Þe guttes hij eten for loue fyne, And for penaunce and for discipline. Anoþer folk þere is a-cost, Stille men, wiþouten bost. Whan hij seen seek her vryne, Hij nylleþ seche no medicyne, Ac from her frendes hij stelen, And gon to wood and maken hem holen, And crepen þere-inne and steruen so. Ne ben hij founden neuermo. Anoþer folk þere is biside— Houndynges men clepeþ hem wide. From þe brest to þe grounde Men hij ben, abouen houndes. Berkyng of houndes hij habbe. Here honden, wiþouten gabbe, Ben yshuldred as an fysshe, And clawed after hound, jwisse. Jn wood hij woneþ, God it woot, And libben by þe wilde goot. Anoþer folk þere is ferliche, Also blak so any pycche. An ei?e hij habbeþ and nomo, And a foot on to goo. Wiþ his foot, whan hyt ryneþ, He wrieþ his body and w[h]an it shineþ, For his foot so mychel is Jt may his body wryen, jwis. Anoþer folk þere is forþers, Þat libbeþ also palmers; Ac oþer mete þai ne habben Bot hawen, hepen, slon, and crabben. On þe souþ side, þere Ynde makeþ ende, Woneþ a folk wise and hende. Hij cloþen hem wiþ grijs and ermyne, Wiþ golde and siluer and skarlet pure fyne— Faire visage, and of face bolde. Here hij habben ?elewe so golde. Cites hij habben, and castels plente, And eten and drynken of grete deynte. None men in þe londe of Ynde Ne fareþ so wel, als Ich fynde. Anoþere folk þere is bisyde, Þat habbeþ furchures swiþe wide. Ei?ttene feet hij ben longe, Swiþe li?th and swiþe stronge. Jn þe londe by þe forest Þere hem likeþ wonyng best. Barefoot hij gon wiþouten shoon. Michel wi?tnesse hij mowen don— Euery wilde dere a-store Hij mowen by cours ernen tofore. Wymmen þere ben mychel and belde— Whan hij ben of fiftene wyntres elde, Children hij beren, verrayment, Þat ben of body fair and gent. Ac no womman of þat contrey Ne lyueþ no lenger, par ma fey, Þan she be of twenty wyntres age, For þan she gooþ to deþes cage. Þere-biside is a folk ful wijs, And proude men, of mychel prijs. Hij connen hem shilde from al sorou?, For hij arisen erly amo[r]we, And gon to þe cees stronde; On on foot alday hij stonde. By þe walken and by þe sterren Hij juggen þanne alle werren, And hij connen by swiche boke From euery contek her londe loke. Þise men han selkouþe wyues, And childen bot ones in al her lyues. Al[s] sone as þat childe yborne is, Jt haþ wytt or har, jwys, And may speken to his dame— Now is þis a selkouþe game! Anoþer folk woneþ hem bisyde— A riche folk of mychel pride. Of nynetene wyntres and an half, Hij ben hore also a wolf, And whan hij ben of þritty ?aar, Hij ben broun of hare as hij weren aar. And so ay, by þe ten ?ere, Þe coloure chaunges of her here. None men so longe libbe As don hij and her sibbe. Of wonder folk ?ee habbeþ yherd Þat woneþ in þis myddelerde. Jn a fewe ydles of Ynde Fele moo þere beþ bihynde; Ac a fewe wordes, wiþ ?oure wille, Of Alisaunder Ich wil telle, Þoo he rood toward Porus, His fomen wel malicious, Of bestes, of wormes in desert Þat he sei? wiþ his ei?en apert, And suffred w[iþ] bataile so stronge Þat slayn he was nei? hem amonge. He and alle his noble men, Als hij riden from Facen, Day and oþer and þrid vpon Mi?tten hij fynde water non, Bot wildernesse and non oþere þing. Wel sore anoyed was þe kyng, For he sei? his stedes honestes, Dromedaries, and oþer bestes, Toforne his ei?en steruen for þurst. Of alle pyne þat was hym werst. Naþeles, wiþ alle peyne, He fonde þere-after ane pleyne. Amyddes þe pleyne was a laak, And þe water þere-of was blaak. Þe water was ful of longe reede— Þe kyng þere þou?th to bete his nede. Þe sonne gan in þe west helde. Þe kyng þere hete his pauylouns telde, And for-bed lowe and hei?e Þat non ne shulde, vpon her ei?e, Of þe water drynk ne taste, Ar he had asked tryacle on haste. Of þis water he proued, siker, Ac þere was neuer galle so bitter. Ne had he had tryacle þoo, Hadden hij neuer forþer goo. Naþeles, al þat ilk ni?th, He bileued þere ri?th. Many of his men and bestes, A?ein Kyng Alisaunder hestes, Stelendelich dronken of þis lake. Wel woo was hym for þaire sake! Many þere storuen—so hadden moo, Ac a palmer þere com þoo, And tau?tte þe kyng an herbe take, Wiþ whiche he shulde hem hole make. Þe kyng wiþ þat herbe onon ?af hem bote euerychon. Jt was an aungel, so seiþ þe book, Þat þe kyng þe herbe took. A-morowe þe kyng and his baronage Wenten forþ in her viage. Of al þat hij mi?tten riden ne gon, Water ne mi?tten hij fynde non. Þe sonne and þe dust aroos— Þe kyng of his folk agroos, And for his bestes, par ma fey, Þat drowen and ledden his charrey, For nei? hij weren boþe for þurst Astrangled and ek for-þrest. Jt nas no wonder, als J fynde, For of olyfaunz two þousynde Þe kynges golde and siluer bare. Þat was a riche chaffare! Foure hundreþ olifaunz baren his engynes, To þrowen wiþ magnels to his weþerwynes. A þousande þere drowen cartes longe, Þat ledden mete and armes stronge; Ten þousande mules þe kynges tresours On rewe berande heuy somers, And fyue hundreþ camailes of Asseries, And two þousande dromedaries, And a þousande bugles of Ynde, And two þousande oxen, als J fynde, Wiþouten horses, wiþouten steden, Of whiche noman ne couþe areden Þe noumbre bot þe heuene kyng, Þat woot þe soþe of al þing, Ne of þe kynges curreye, Þat lasteþ twenty mylen weye. Jt nas no wonder þou? þe kyng Hadde doel and grete mournyng, For of men on fote, als J fynde, He had þre hundreþ þousynde, And two hundreþ þousende of kni?ttes, And þritty þousande stronge and wi?ttes. Many þousande of þem þere starf, Þat þrust to þe herte carf. Seuen ni?th þis þrust last— Þe more ne drunken ne þe lest. At þe seuen ni?ttes ende A castel-toun þe kyng com hende. Þoo he it sei? þe kyng was bliþe, And gan þider hy?en swiþe. Men of þe castel and wymman Bihelden þat oost þat to hem cam. For drede hij weren out of wytt— Jn hij went and her gates shytt. Her brygge hij drow?en, bliif, And boþe hem hyd man and wijf. Þe kyng com þider wiþ his oost, And cleped and made grete boost, And askede water o[i]þe[re] ryuere, Ac non nolde hym answere. Wiþ mangenels ne wiþ gynne Ne mi?th he on word ywynne. Þe kyng hete onon-ri?ttes Two hundreþ of ?onge kni?ttes, Þat weren in water wise, Armen hem in breny of yse, Wiþouten cotoned aketoun, Oiþer plate oiþer gaumbisoun, Wiþ swerd ygird and wiþ knyue, And in to þe salt water blyue, To þe castel and ouere wynne, Forto wyte, wiþ sum gynne, What folk þere weren jnne. Þe kni?ttes stoden on hei?e brymme, And lepen in to þe cees arme. Þat was boþe reuþe and harme! Swiþe wi?tlych hij bigynne, Þe þriddendale and faire swymme Of þe water þat hij were jnne, Vp berande faire chynne. Ac þoo hem aroos a vile meschaunce, Kyng Alisaunder to gret greuaunce! Ypotames comen flyngynge, Out of roches, loude nayinge— Grete bestes and griselich, More þan olifaunz, sikerlich. Jn to þe water hij shoten onon, And freten þe kni?ttes euerychon. Alisaunder, þe riche kyng, Þoo wep and made grete mournyng, And of þe oost þe gentil-men Bigradden and wepden her ken. Þe kyng in wraþþe nyme dede Þrid half hundreþ in þe stede Of his gyours and þere-inne hem cast. Hij weren freten alle in hast Of þe wilde bestes ypotame, So is þere hoten her name. Þe gode clerk men cleped Solim Haþ ywriten in his Latin Þat ypotame a wonder beest is, More þan an olifaunt, jwis. Toppe and rugge and croupe and cors Js semblabel to an hors; A short beek and a croked tayl He haþ, and bores tussh, saunz fayl. Blak is his heued as pycche— Jt is a beeste ferliche! Jt wil al fruyt ete, Applen, noten, reisyns, and whete, Ac mannes flesshe and mannes bon Jt loueþ best of euerychon. Jn roche is his wony?ing, Jn water and londe his purchaceyng. Boþe hij eteþ flesshe and fysshe; Of no beest drad he nys. Hyndantforþ he tourneþ his pas Whan he gooþ on any cas, Þat noman ne shulde ywite Whiderward hij were biwite. Michel was þe pleynt and þe grade Þat þe folk hadden ymade, Ac so he sei?e non mendynge. By þe heste of þe kynge Þennes hij wenten, wiþouten duellyng, And sou?tten better soiournyng. Mery tyme it is in Maij! Þe foules syngeþ her lay. Þe kni?ttes loueþ þe turnay; Maydens so dauncen and þay play. Þe kyng forþ rideþ his journay— Now hereþ gest of grete noblay. Alday he rideþ to mydouer-non. Water mi?th he fynde non, Bot a fyssher in þe cee— He bad hym, par charite, He shulde hem teche to sum ryuere, And he shulde haue gode here; And he hem tau?tte ouer a wode To fynden watres swiþe gode. Al þat day and al þat ni?th Hij riden south-est ri?th. Bores, beres, and lyouns, Olyfaunz, tygres, and dragouns, Vnces grete, and leopardes, ?euen hem many assaut hardes, And slow?en many bolde and wi?thes Of kyng Alisaunder kni?ttes. Ac so hij comen ouer þat wode, And founden watres s[w]iþe gode. Þere was telt many pauyloun Of riche sendel and siclatoun. Many banere and banerett Was on pauyloun ysett. Þe kynges ost lasted aboute Two and twenty milen, wiþouten doute. Þe kyng dude onon afelle Many þousande okes, Ich telle, Beches, birches, of þe fairest, And hete sette on fire on hast. Hij maden fyres vertuous Fyue hundreþ, vche gret als an hous, For þe kyng wolde haue swiche li?th He nere bitrayed vpon þat ni?th. To mete was greiþed boef and motoun, Bredes, briddes, and venysoun. Þe kyng ofsent erles and barouns, For to sopere it was seysouns. Tofore þe kyng henge a charbokelston And two þousande laumpes of gold and on, Þat casten also mychel li?th As by day þe sonne bri?th. Þe glevmen vseden her tunge— Þe wode aquei?tte, so hij sunge. To and twenty milen aboute Of barouns and kni?ttes lasted þe route. Also þe kyng and his meigne Gladdest weren and aveyse, Grete addren comen flynge, And scorpions wiþ vile whistlynge, Tygres, olyfauntz, and beres, Comen flynge wiþ grete heres, And assaileþ wiþ cry and boost Al Alisaundres oost. Jn þis tyme, nou?th fer þenne, Woned a kyng of selkouþ menne. Hij ben ycleped Albanyen— Alle hij ben wi?th men. Her visages ben blew so ynde; Swiche oþer men ne may non fynde. Alle wolden-ei?ed hij beeþ— By ni?th als a catt hij seeþ. Of foure feet hij habbeþ þe lengþe, And ben men of grete strengþe. Þe kyng dude by his mennes rede, And to haue Alisaunder frenderede Of golde he sent hym a coroune, And a swiþe fair faukoune, Tweye bugle-hornes, and a bowe also, And fyue arewen ek þerto, Jn a cheyne of golde [and] tweie grefhounde— Ne haue Ich none swiche yfounde. Hij weren mychel als lyouns; Of mete neren hij none glotouns. Þoo þat brou?tten þis present Wiþ faire ?iftes a?ein were went. Now ariseþ cry and boost Amonge Alisaunders oost, Of scorpiouns and addren wiþ her speres, Of tigres, olifauntz, lyouns, and beres, Þat mychel of Alisaunder folk totereþ; And wiþ brondes and swerdes hij hem wereþ, And of þe addres and scorpiouns Hij slowen a grete fuysouns. Ac þe houndes of whiche we spaak Her cheyne bituene hem hij braak; Þat on lep on a lyoun And to grounde hym þrew adoun, And hym astrangled meigntenaunt. Þe oþer lep on an olyfaunt And þrew hym also to grounde, And strangled hym in litel stounde, And wiþ how and wiþ cry Þe oþere duden away flei?e. Þe kyng and ek his meigne Þere-of hadden grete glee. Þe smale addren of whiche we spaake Weren bileued att a lake, And dronken and wesshen hem saunz faile. Þe kyng þere-of had meruaile. Also þe kyng was meruelynde, A cry he hereþ gret byhynde— A gret noyse of ful soun, As al þe werlde shulde adoun. Þan comen dragouns flynge— Non of hem ne lyst synge! Shelde and spere in honde hij toke; Euery gan his heuede loke. Þise dragons weren of diuers coloure, And fou?tten a?ein wiþ grete vigoure, And slow?en of þe kynges men Moo þan an hundreþ and ten. Þus þise dragons wiþ þis kni?ttes Fou?tten two tydes of þe ni?ttes, And þoo comen þe addren smale, Of whiche was first oure tale, A?eins þe dragons and helden fi?th Anoþer tyde of þe ni?th, And ouercomen hem wiþ maistrie. Þe kyng onon dude crye Þat non mysdone hem ne sholde, As he sauen his lijf wolde. Þus þe smale addren ?eden and come Wiþouten harme of alle and some. Þoo was þe folk to rest ward. Ac now hem comeþ a wonder hard— From þe mountayn swiche a soun As al þe werlde shulde adoun, And fyre flyngynge also clere As al þe werlde were on fyre. Þoo nas þere non of so good loos Þat in herte hym agroos. Jt nas no wonder, for dragouns it ware! Summe two, summe þre heuedes bare, Þat grisely whistleden and blasten, And of her mouþe fyre out casten. Alisaunder and his kni?ttes of mi?th A?eins hem wiþ armes gonne fi?th, And euerychon slou?en to grounde— Þat was a dede of mychel mounde! Þe kyng þere les tuenty kni?ttes And on and þritty of sergeantz wi?ttes, Ac joye hij hadden at þe frome Þat þe deuelen weren o uercome. Þe kyng hym-seluen seide þoo: ‘Here is now mychel woo! Resten we now for þis ni?th more— Ne shullen we þolen more sore.’ Hij token rest a litel wi?tth, Forto it were ouer midni?th. Þan þere comen by on lowe, As al þe wood shulde ouere-þrowe, Of wonder bestes many þousynde. Crabben hij [h]oten als J fynde. Hij weren as mychel as bores— Þoo was þat folk agrised sores! Twelue feet hadden eueryche, And als þe deuel hij weren griseliche. Þise bigonnen þat folk assayle And bigonnen grete batayle. Hij leiden hem on, on side, on regge, Wiþ axe and swerde of gode egge. Ac hij ne mi?tten hem hirt, verrayment, Ne wiþ swerd ne wiþ dent. For steel ne yrne her swerd Ne mi?th hem percen, hij weren so hard. Ac naþeles in her honden Hij henten grete fire-bronden, And þorou? þat fyre and Goddes mi?th Hij hem slou?en doune-ri?th, And wolden þoo haue ynome restes, Ac þoo com flyngende oþere bestes— White lyouns, þan boles more. Þat folk was þoo adrad wel sore! Þe kyng vp lepeþ and helpeþ his men, And slowen hem by twelue and ten. Þe mest part þere-of hij slowen; Þe oþer flowen and away drowen. Ac onon, after þat wonder, Comen tigres many hundre, Graye-bicchen als it waren, And fyre in her mouþes baren, Þat folk assaileden anon-ri?ttes, And many slowen of þe kynges kni?ttes, And fou?tten wiþ hem, par ma fay, Forto it were almest day, And flowen þoo to her denne. Woo was þe kyng and ek his menne Þat ilk ni?th, wiþouten rest, So woo hem dude þe wilde beest. Þoo comen þere fleynge sory foules, More þan colueren, ac hij weren foule. Hij weren blake-feþered on þe wombe, An rou? on þe rigge als a lombe. Hij weren toþed als a man, And tressed in þe nekkes as a womman. Cry hij hadden als a pecok. Griselich was her flok! Þise duden þe oost mychel noye Jn þe gravkyng of þe daye. Þoo comen þere dasshyng bestes ferlich— Man ne sau? neuere none swich. Hij ben yhote Dentyrauns. More hij ben þan olyfaunz— Blake-heueded after a palfray, Ac in þe foreheuede, par ma fay, Hij haue þre hornes sharpe and longe, And als a stede hij ben stronge. Þise haue þe kyng assaylle And y?ouen hym grete bataille. An hundreþ kni?ttes twenty and to Hij han hym yslawe, and lesse ne mo. Þe kyng and his barouns mi?tty Of hem slou? two and fyfty. Þe oþere part away hij dryuen Jn to dales and in to clyuen. Here-after litel, in a stounde, Comen vp out of þe grounde Amonge þe folk, sodeynlich, Grete foxes and griselich. By þe membres and by þe cors Hij biten boþe man and hors. Her bytt envenymed was— Man ne beest non þere nas, And he were of hem ybite, Þat he nas ded, God it wyte. Noman ne mi?th hem sloo; Þerfore hij duden mychel woo, And slow?en boþe man and beest. Þe kyng þere-of hadde molest. Þoo comen þere flei?eyng foules blake And houeden on hei?e ouere þe lake, And of perches and of savmouns Token and eten grete foysouns. And þoo hij hadden eten ynowe, To þe ost ward hij drowe, And sei?en þese bestes hem amonge. Þe foules weren of clowes stronge— Vp hij sperden and away hem bare, And þo deliuered þat folk of care. Þe kyng and al his meignee Þere-of hadden joye and glee. Þe sonne ariseþ, þe day spryngeþ, Dewes falleþ, þe foules syngeþ. Þe oost arist on erne-morowe Þat haþ had a ni?th of sorowe. Nov it is ypassed hij ne don þere-of, Bot gamenen togedres and ek scoff. Þe kyng forþ went to Ba[u]das, Nou?th fer þenne to a Bocas. He þere was a litel while. Nou listneþ of a queynt gyle. Porus þe kyng had wille wiþ þe mest To wite of Alisaunders estre; To wite his estre and his beyng Grete wille had Porus þe kyng, So þat þe tale and þe sklaunder Com to Kyng Alisaunder, And swore onon, so most he þee, He wolde wite who was he. Þe kyng dude of his robe furred wiþ meneuere, And dooþ on a borel of a squyer And a li?th tabard, als J fynde, And trusseþ a male hym bihynde. Vpon a mule he went forþ onon, And gynneþ flynge gode scour hir vpon, Forto he com to Ba[u]das, Þere þe kyng Porus was, Jn þe strete conseilynde Wiþ his riche folk of Ynde. Alisaunder comeþ vpon his mule, Bishiten and bydagged foule, His mules sides al blody, And flyngeþ gode s[c]o[u]r hem forby. Kyng Porus by his man Dude hym swiþe clepe a?an, And asked hym whennes he was and whennes he com, And he swore, bi Goddes dom, Þat he was of Grece a swayn And þe kyng [Phelipp]es chaumberlayn, Wexe to bygge in þ[e] cite, Of whiche hij hadden scarsete. ‘Saye,’ quoþ Porus, ‘what man is Alisaunder Þat of loos bereþ so gret sklaunder?’ And he ansuered, verrayment, Þat he was hendy, wi?th, and gent, And he was a litel man and an elde, And had on at þe mete for þe chelde Twoo þik mantels, yfurred wiþ grys. ‘Certes!’ quoþ Porus, ‘Ich am vnwys! Ne habbe Ich ytake cite and toune To his wille in baundoune? Often ar þis me agroos, For man leide on hym swiche loos. Ac now ne shal J bliþe be Forto Ich hym mowe mete and see Wiþ suerd and shelde in batayle, To proue his wi?tnesse, saunz faile.’ To hym þat rood he seide þoo: ‘Jch me awonder, by seint Bardo, Siþþe þat Alisaunder is so elde, Hou he dar and is so belde, And hou he may and is so hardy Oþer kynges to done foly— Nou?th on, ne two, ne þre, ac alle, Nymeþ par force and makeþ hem þralle.’ Þe folk seide þat abouten stood He ne had neuer so hardy blood Þat he durst þe kyng ysee. ‘?is,’ quoþ he þat rode, ‘so mote J þee, He dar wiþ þee speke and ek yseen!’ Quoþ þe kyng Porus: ‘Jeo crey [ceo] ben! Jch wil þee ?iue of golde a mark, And a stede stronge and stark, By so þou wil wiþouten ansuere To ?oure kyng a lettre bere.’ And he hym graunted, God it wyte. Þe lettre was onon ywrite— Kyng Alisaunder it vnderfynge, And golde and siluer to medyng. He smoot his mule wiþ sporen whate; Bot whan he com to þe gate To þe porter he ?af þe golde, And lete þe mule gon where he wolde. On þe destrer onon he slang— Als arewe of bowe forþ he sprang. To his folk he com ful swiþe, And of his comyng hij weren bliþe. He li?tte and tolde his auenture— Hij low?en and maden enuesure. Alisaunder þe wryt bihelde, And sau? þere-inne þretyng belde And defyeaunce þe þrid day— Þat was his gamen and his play. Þe þridd day wel sone cam. Kyng Alisaunder his armes nam, And armed hym ful wel And al his folk in jrne and steel. So dude kyng Porus, saunz faile, And comen hem to chaumpe bataile. Þere was displayed many gounfanoun Of riche sendel and cyclatoun. Þere was many riche stede, And many kni?th wel ful of pride. Þere was many faire justynge, Assailynge and defendynge, Ac naþeles kyng Alisaunder wiþ his man Of Porus kyng þe maistrie wan. Kyng Porus ?alde his swerd to his honde, And to his wille al his londe. Kyng Alisaunder was h[ym] curteys, And graunted hym his loue and pays. Now ben þe kynges men euerychon And ek Porus al at on, Ac Porus and al his folk, parde, Ben of Kyng Alisaundres meignee. Now went Porus, so J fynde, Wiþ Kyng Alisaunder ouere al Ynde, To shewe hym þe merueilynges Of men, of bestes, of oþer þinges, And helpen wynne vnder his honde Alle þe naciouns of þe londe. Of Baudas wenden þise kynges of prijs. Wiþouten noumbre her poeple is; Neuer, in al þis myddelerde, Nas so myche folk in on ferde. Hij passeden dales, hij passede pleynes, Wildernesse and mounteynes. Hij comen to þe on werldes ende, And þere hij founden þing of mynde: Of pure golde two grete ymages Jn þe cee stonden on brasen stages. After Ercules hij weren ymad, And after his fader, of golde sad. Ercules was whilom a man Þat non ne mi?th stonde a?ein. Þider he wan þe middelerde, By maistres, be werres he conquerde. He sette þere ymages of moundes Þat men clepeþ Ercules boundes. Þe kyng and his folk, saunz faile, Þere-of hadden grete merueile. Kyng Alisaunder asked onon ?if hij mi?tten forþer gon. A cherle hym ansuered a?einward (To his nauel henge his berd; He was also blak as pycche, And had a face wel griseliche): ‘Sir,’ he seide, ‘south hiderward Js þe ende of myddelerd. A west half, ?ee mowen ysee, Þe waye liþe in to þe Rede Cee.

Ac hiderward, sir, in to þe est Þe waye is sikerest and best.

Al þe cee ferd as a forest. Þe fourtenþe day hij comen to Yperoun; Þere hij founden a fair cite-toun, Þere hij founden folk of strengþe. Þe londe is seuen þousande mylen of lengþe, And foure þousande mylen of brede. Þe kyng of þe londe dude by rede, And made wiþ kyng Alisaunder peys, And ?af hym ?iftes of nobleys. Verrayment, þere ne groweþ no whete, Ne oþer corne bot spyces swete. Þere-of hij maken her breed, And drynken wyne, white and red Eueryche man and eke womman Of þe londe of Taproban Of an hundreþ wyntres ful-libbeþ þe dawe, Bot hij ben of fomen yslawe. Hij ben ycloþed, in alle wones, Jn golde and siluer and precious stones. Jt is boystous folk, naþelas, Michel folk and griselich of faas. Þe kyng had wiþ hem many fest, Swithe riche and ek honest. Forþer þan in to þe est Nas no wonyng bot wilde best, Addres wiþ foure hedes, and dragouns, Gripes, tygres, and lyouns, And a maner folk þere is yfounde Þat men clepeþ cee-hounde. Þe addres shiteþ preciouse stones— Listneþ now for þe nones! Jn shynyng of þe sonne, whan Marche blaweþ, Þe addres vpward hem þraweþ, And tocleueþ wombelyng A?eynes þe sonne shynyng, And conceyueþ of þe sonne, veire, By nature of þe wynde and eire. And ?if of fele hiwe is þe eyre, So shullen þe stones ben in veyre. Swich is þis addres kyndlyng— Preciouse stones, wiþouten lesyng, Jacynkte, piropes, crisolites, Safyres, smaragdes, and margarites. Bi?onde þe dragouns, gripes, and beste, Paradys terrene is ri?th in þe est, Where God almi?tty, þorou? his grace, Fourmed Adam, oure fader þat was. Þe kyng þennes went forþ A?ein in to Ynde in þe norþ, Þat is ycleped, als J fynde, Jn þe book þe vpper Ynde. Þoo he com wiþ his compaignye, Al þe londe he fonde ywrye Wiþ armed men, riche and pouer, Kynges, dukes, on and oþer, Þat hym and hise wiþ swerd gretten And wiþ sharpe launces metten, And of ?onge kni?ttes slou?en þe floure. Þe kyng þerfore was in doloure. Hij maden her armes envenymed— He þat was taken of deþ was lymed. Alisaunder wexe wrooþ and gan hym bistere, And eke alle hise gode fi?tteres Þise folk to-hewe and slou?e Mo þousandes þan ynowe, And ouercomen hem at þe last. Þe remenaunt þan flei? on hast Bisiden in to a riche cite. Þe kyng hem bishette wiþouten pite, And in on ni?th, by on metyng, ?af al his folk botyng. Onon after þat cite he feld And al þat folk anon queld. Childe in credel, man ne wijf, Ne lete he neuere on a-lijf. Forþ went þe kyng wondres sekynde. A griselich best he gonne fynde— So mychel sei? he neuere ne non swiche. Two heuedes it had wel ferlich; To a cokedrille þat on was liche, Þat oþere þe mone selcouþ liche. His rigge was bristled as wiþ sharp siþen; Teeþ he had so wreþen wriþen. Ei?en he had so brennyng bronde, And two kni?ttes of Grece londe At þe first assau?t it slou?. Þe kyng ne non of his ne lou?, Ac hij it smyten, myche and lyte, And non arme nolde byte Jn þat beeste, so mote J lyuen, And hij it away tofor hem dryuen. Forþ went þe kyng þennes wiþ hij. Of þe forme warde he herd grete cry, For hij weren assailed of olifauntz. Þe kyng hi?ed and his sergeaunz, Ac, so J fynde on þe book, By Porus conseil hogges hij took, And beten hem so þat hij shri?tte. Þe olyfauntz away hem di?tte, For hij ne haue so mychel drade Of noþing as of hogges grade. Nyne hundreþ and ei?tte hij slow?e, And quyk þai lokeden þerof ynowe To seruen hem in batailles, And to beren her vitailles. Þe sonne loweþ and west helt; Þe kynges pauylouns þere men telt, And token hem þere herberewe, Forto þe sonne ryse amorowe. God make alle sory bliþe! Who-so wil lystne and liþe, Þe most wonder ?e mowen vnderstonde Þat ben yfounden in Ynde londe. In tyme of heruest mery it is ynou?— Peres and apples hongeþ on bou?, Þe hayward bloweþ mery his horne, Jn eueryche felde ripe is corne, Þe grapes hongen on þe vyne. Swete is trewe loue and fyne! Kyng Alisaunder a-morowe arist— Þe sonne dryueþ away þe myst. Forþ he went ferre in to Ynde, Moo merueiles forto fynde. Hij founden many lake and pett, Wiþ trowes and þornes byshett, Wiþinne greue and mychel weed, Water-kressen and hei?e reed. Þere hij sei?en men, Ich wil avowe, And wymmen as beres rowe. Bristled hij weren as hogges And stynken as water-dogges. Jn þe water hij swymme and ?ede— Ypotami hem leued myde. Alle hij lyueden by raw fyssh. [S]o hij sei?e þat folk, jwys, Hij plumten doune as an doppe Jn þe water at on scoppe. Þoo hij plumten þe water vnder, Þe folk had of hem grete wonder. Forþ went þe kyng and al his folk apert Wondres to seen in þe desert, And entreden toward þe west Jn to a swiþe fair forest, And founden appel-trowes and fygeres, Peryes, cypres, and olyuers, Þat weren þre hundreþ feet longe. Þere was mery foules songe. Þe shadewe cast two mylen wayes— Þoo weren trewes of nobleyes. Þere-biside, wiþouten lees, Hij founden a water yhoten Ganges. Þere ben jnne eles stronge Þat beþ þre hundreþ fet longe. Hij habbeþ in hem hondes two, Wiþ whiche hij don mychel woo. Olyfauntz and kni?ttes jn hij drowen And in þe water sone slowen. Þere hij sei?en a selcouþ folk, Alday pouren in þe walken, And alday [o]n on fote stondynde, And neuere wery, so J fynde. So hij ben delited in þat art Þat wery ne ben hij neuere, cert. Þe kyng and hise wenten forþ, Jn to þe est, in to þe north, Als fer as hij for water mi?th, Ac of wondres nadden hij more si?th Þat any tale be of to telle, Bot of bestes and wormes felle, And of þe wederes stronge and tempestes, Þat hem duden grete molestes. Þe kyng lete þe waye of þe est And by a ryuer tourned west. He was war of a cite walle, Swiþe fair and stronge wiþ alle. Þider hij drowen, lesse and more, Hem of vitaile to astore. Ac þe men of þat cite Weren ful of iniquite, And ronnen to her gates fast And hem shetten wel on hast. Alisaundre and his meygnee Comen and badden hem entree, Ac non ne w[o]lde ansuere a word, Neiþer to man ne to lorde. Þe kyng of his stede ali?th, And stee? on þe wal anon-ri?th And loked ouer what hij dede. Hij weren redy in þat stede, Als J fynde on þe boke, And pli?tten hym jn wiþ yrnen hoke, And laiden hym on wiþ swerd and batt— Þe kyng was nei? al to-flatt Er he wist where he was. Þe kyng rek[eue]red, naþelas. Vnder shelde he gan hym were, And wel swiftely hym bistere— Smoot and leide on wiþ mayn, And slou? a-rawe two duzeyn, And, maugre þe teeþ of hem alle, Sette his rigge to þe walle. Þat folk grete assau?t hym ?aue— Wiþ swerdes, axes, stones, and staue, Woundeden, felden and sore hym hirten. His woundes bledden, his dyntes smerten, Þat he grented als a bore, And deled many a dynt sore. Of summe he karf heued of, of summe arme, Of summe foot and legge—it nas non harme! He slow? an hundreþ in a rawe, Þat at his feet laien yslawe. Þe prince of þe cite sei? þis, And com flynge onon, jwis, Wiþ a launce on his hors And smoot Alisaunder þorou? þe cors, And braided hym doune on knee to grounde. Þe kyng swo?ened for þat wounde, And hastilich hym-self awei?tte And þe launce out plei?tte, And lepe on fote, wiþ swerd of steel And gan hym were swiþe wel, Ac vnneþe on his feet he stood— He had bled so mychel blood— And þe folk hym leide on ay þe lenge þe more, By-hynde and biside, and also bifore. Jn þe ost wiþoute a noble duk was Þat was yhote sir Perdicas. Þis on þe wal stei? on hei?, And al his lordes tourment sei?. Anon he lepe doun of þe walle Amonge þe kynges fomen alle, And wiþ his swerd sharp ygrounde He ?af many a dedly wounde. Sexty swiþe and þerto fyue He byname þe dayes of lyue; Ac, forsoþe, ne had he so ycome, Þe kyng had ben sleyn oiþer ynome. Wharfore kyng Alisaunder ouer þan Loued sir Perdicas ouere alle his man, And made hym his heire seþe Ouere al Grece in his deþe. Þe kyng is bicomen fiers and li?th And wi?tly a?eins his fomen gan fi?th, And Perdicas feyned nou?th, For als a wode lyoun he fau?th. Þe kynges oost þat wiþouten was Hadden aspyed al þis cas, And brou?tten gynnes to þe walle— Houen, shouen, and drowen alle, And, maugre Picard and Bretoun, Breken þere þe wal adoun, And in flunge in litel stounde, And leiden al þat folk to grounde. Ac Alisaunder, his owen honde, Biheueded þe prince of þe londe, And siþen, wiþouten any pyte, Sette on fyre þat cite, And forbrent it, more and lesse, And made þerof wildernesse. Þere-biside his pauylouns Weren ytelde, by dales and dovnes. Þe kyng þere soiourned to he was hoole. Tohardy man wel ofte is fole! So had þe kyng yben nei?, Ac God h[y]m sent help from hei?. Þo þe kyng was hool and wel ydou?th, Mo wondres he haþ ysou?th. Euerych ydle, euerych contrey, He ha[þ] ysou?th, par ma fey. An ydle he passeþ yhote Pra[s]iens, And Gangerides and Gangiens, An ydle yhote Cormorans, And a stronge ydle yhote Bramans. Mychel he hym pyned er al þis londe He haueþ ywonne vnder his honde. Jch wil ?ou telle what men ben in Bramande, ?if ?ee willen vnderstande. Hij ben men, wiþouten doutaunce, Of hard lijf and stronge penaunce. Hij ne eten bot gresses rote And fruyt of trees and herbes swote. Þynnelich hij be[þ] yhatered, And drynken of þe broune water. Hij ne eten of oxe ne of swyne; Hij ne drynken of ale ne of wyne. Ne hij ne han boures ne halles, Ne casteles wiþ hei?e walles, Bot in trowes and in denne And in roches holed wiþinne— Þere-inne is her wony?ing. Hij ne eteþ non oþere þing Þan þe erþe ?eue[þ] wiþouten tellyng. Jn penaunce, sikerlyk, Hij don hem brenne also quyk, For her mysdede and for her synne, Þe ioye of Paradys to wynne. Forþ went kyng Alisaunder in his viage; Ne fyndeþ he kyng ne baronage Nowhare in þe londe Þat he ne falleþ to his honde. Þoo had kyng Alisaunder yment, By al his baronage consent, Þe cee haue ypassed a?ein And werren vpon Fraynsshe men, Alemanns, and ek Englysshe, Bretons, Yrissh, and Denmarchisshe. Þo com þere goande a man ferlich, Also blak as any pycch. Calu? was his heuede swerd And to his nauel henge his berd. He ne had noiþere nekk ne þrote— His heued was in his body yshote. An ei?e he had in his vijs, And a foot and nomoo, jwys. He was ru?her þan any ku, And spaak als an helle-bu, And seide to kyng Alisaunder: ‘A pese nys worþ þi riche sclaunder, Bot þou passe here forþ Ouer þe cee, ri?th in þe norþ. Þou shalt þere fynde kynges felouns, Ful of malice and traisouns, Of þe kynde Nebrot þe traitoure, Þat in Babiloyne made þe toure After þe grete Noes flood Þat fele mylen in hei?tte stood, And þorou? Goddes wreche shoten away Jn to þat vile contreye Þat is yhote Taracun— Jn þe werlde nys non so felun, For hij libben by addren and snaken And wormes þat hij mowen taken. Mannes flesshe and mannes blood— Þat hem þinkeþ swete and good; Al þing a?eins kynde— Þat hem þinkeþ good and hende. Many man bitwene Gog Þou shalt fynde and Magog Þat þou ne [founde] none swiche Neuer in no kyngriche. Mowen hij and her sybbe Her wille haue and longe lybb, Alle þe werlde ne shulle hem were Þat hij ne shulle hem wiþ tooþ tere. Ac ?if þou wilt habbe maistrie Of loos and prys þider þou hi?e, And þou mi?th þere by bataile and gynne Of al þe werlde mest loos wynne. Mery it is in halle to here þe harpe; Þe mynstrales synge, þe jogelours carpe. ?ut þou?th mery kyng Alisaunder Of vncouþe londe to here sklaunder. Loude he conseileþ anon-ri?ttes To his dukes, barouns, and kni?ttes: ‘Listneþ,’ he seide, ’gode lordynges! ?ee habbeþ yherd selcouþ tidynges Of vile folk and of felle Þat ben of þe kynde of helle— Þat als houndes ben vnkynde And willen frete mankynde. Al þat we haue wonne and wrou?th Ne helde Ich worþ a tare bou?th, Bot we mowen hem ywynne, Oiþer by bataille oiþer by gynne. Wel we habbeþ now agonne, And fele londes wyde ywonne. Helpeþ me now for myne loue! We mi?tten þat folk ben aboue, And ?oure mede shal riche ben, For al Ich wil ?ou parten bitwen Boþe lande and ek juel, Þat euerich shal ben payed ful wel.’ Þe barouns ?auen conseil hende, And seiden hij wolden wiþ hym wende Wide and syde, al to wille, Þat wicked folk forto spille. Here vp a litel tofore ?ee herde Of þe kynges oost and ferde, Þat amounted fyue hundreþ þousynde Kni?ttes to armes, als J fynde, Wiþouten pages and squyers, Dryuers, gyoures, and sumters, Þe whiche noman ne mi?th telle Bot þe lorde of heuene and helle. Now wil þe kyng echen his oost Fer abouten and ek acost. He sent his messagers and het Men shulde hym sende socour sket. Now ?ee mowen vnderstonde Þat folk þat of selcouþ londe Þat hym com, hou fele þere ware. God vs shilde alle from care! From Mede hym com þousandes ten Of armed kni?ttes, noble men. From Capadoce, wiþouten noo, Of kni?ttes hym com þousandes twoo, And from Asserie þousandes sexe. Now gynneþ his oost fast to wexe, And from Aufrike þousandes seuene Of þe beste vnder heuene. Of Perce selue þousandes ei?tte Hym com of swiþe noble kni?tte; Of Babiloyne and of Esclauonye Fyue þousande of wi?th chiualrie. Þider com þe quene of Sichis, Wiþ ten þousande maidens of prijs, Þat nas neuer ouercome Bot of Alisaunder, þe gode gome. Þider com also, wiþouten assoyne, Two quenes of Amazoyne, Wiþ tuenty þousande to her banere— Faire maydens of white chere Þat weren wi?th in bataile, And comelich in bed, saunz faile. Of Grece, also out of Ynde Hym com þritty þousynde. So mychel folk in on ferde Nas neuer in þis myddellerde. Þoo þe kyng þis oost ysay, Had in his herte wel grete joy. He shipped his folk in grete caynars, Jn dromons and in shippes lumbars, Drou? vp sailes and wenten forþ To Taracumcte, ri?th pure norþ. Þe folk of þe londe herden þe sclaunder Þat to hem com kyng Alisaunder. Hij hadden warnysshed cite-tounes, Boþe in dales and ek in dounes, And calktrappes made ynowe, Jn wayes and vnder wood-bowe, Alisaunder men to afelle And gilefullich to aquelle. Jn to þe mores hij hem drawen, To quede paþes, to quede shawen, Forto seke and forto slen Of kyng Alisaunders men. Kyng Alisaunder and his baronage Herberewe taken, gode ryuage. Whan hij han rested a lyte, Þe lande hij wenden to visite. Hij founden narewe paþes and li?tt fen, A?eins hem many þousande men. Boþe parties flungen togedres, So dooþ þe hayl wiþ þe wedres. Þere was sone many banere good Wasshen and baþed in rede blood, And many keruyng swerd Made lefdy wiþouten lorde. Þere was many kni?th yslawe And many man brou?th of lijfdawe. Ac for hij weren in þe fen, Kyng Alisaunder lees fele men (Ac algate þe kynges fon Loren ten a?eins on). Þis bataile lasted a day ri?th, Forto it were a?eins ni?th. Þe kyng þoo het Antiochoun, Þat was maister of his baroun, Al his folk to þe mount lede. He dude onon by þe kynges rede— He blew an horne þat was yknowe. Þan gonne þai to þe mount drawe. Of hirdles and brigges hij maden flores, And so hij wenten jn to þe mores, And þere hij fou?tten and þere hij slowe Moo of men þan ynowe, And bynomen alle þilk men Þe mores, þe shawes, and þe fen, And ouer dales and ouer clyuen To Taracuncte by strengþe hem dryuen, Þe maister cite þat was Of al þe londe of Magogas. Þe wayes weren so streite and vile Þat horsman non by twenty myle Ne mi?tten comen þe toun nei?e, To greuen hem ne don ennoye, And hij alday his folk to-drowe, Souken her blood and her flesshe gnowe. Þe selue men of þe londe Weren blake so colow?y bronde, And teeþ hadden ?elewe as wax, Euerych as a bores tux. Ru? hij waren als a bere— Hij weren mouþed als a mere. Eueten, snaken, and paddes brood— Þat hem þincheþ mete good! Al vermyne hij eteþ, And beeste and man quyk hij freteþ. Eueryche of hem liþe by oþer, Son by moder, suster by broþer. So commune hij beeþ, ywys, Non woot who his fader is. Alle þe naciouns of þe londe Weren fallen to her honde— Two and twenty kyngriches from Gog Al forto þou come to Magog. Noman telle ne mi?th Of þat folk bot oure dri?th. Þe kyng was sory, saunz faile, Þat he ne mi?th ?iue hem bataile, Bot h[ere] and þa[re] bi sekyng, Þat was al to his lesyng. He seide al þat he had ywonne Jn þe werlde vnder sonne, He nolde ?iue þere-of a pynne, Bot he mi?th þise wynne, Oiþer destroye oiþer aferre, Þat hij ne made in þis werlde werre. For mosten hij comen to oþer londe, Corne and drynk and metes fonde, Alle þe naciouns of þe myddelerde He wolden don to þe swerde, And forfreten wiþ her teeþ— Þar-of Alisaunder siker beeþ. Þerfore hij biþenkeþ hem streyte By queyntise to don oþer disceyte, Wharþorou? þis werlde deliueren hij mi?th Of þe foule vnwrast wi?th. He took barouns many on And went to an hyl ycleped Selyon, And þan on Sarsynes wise Maden offryng and sacrifise, And so longe cryed and bede Þat þere hym com from heuen rede, Hou he shulde hem destroye Þat hij ne shulde þis werlde ennoye, Ne in þis werlde don greuaunce. Now ariseþ a gode romaunce. Alonde is bitwene Egipte and Ynde, Jn maistres bokes als J fynde. Jn an ydle of water hij woneþ— Aqueyntaunce of alle men hij shoneþ, For he woneþ in water, jwys, So dooþ þe jker oiþere þe fyssh. A clay hij habbeþ, verrayment, Stronge so yrne, tou? so cyment. Þere-of hij makeþ boures and walle, Þat neuermore ne mowen falle, And wyndewes closed by on gynne (Neuermore water comeþ þere-inne; Whan it is eb, vp hij beeþ— Whan it is flood, yshet hij beeþ). Shippes hij habbeþ yhote pirates; Jn þe water ben her gates. Hij ben made of hosyers, als J fynde, And bounden al wiþ tou? rynde. Abouen and byneþen is her helyng Wiþ buttemay þat wele so clyng, Þat no water, salt ne cler, Hem to dere ne haþ power. Als we fynden on her bokes, By her gynnes and by her crokes So swifte vnder þe water hij rideþ So any shippe abouen glideþ. Þis ydle is yhote Meopante. Þe kyng þider messagers sent, And [þ]oo spedden þorou? his mede Þat he had her frenderede. Þe kyng was of hardy blod, And wiþ hem went vnder flood. He sei? þe jkeres woniynge And þe fisshes lotyinge, Hou euery oþer gan mete, And þe more þe lesse gan frete. Þe boþome of þe ce þere he knew, Hou þe wynde roos and hou it blew, And þe marches of þe cee, j-wys, From helle al to Paradys. Þoo he had yben þere Þe mountaunce of half a ?ere, He had purveyed of þe londe Many þousande shippes, J vnderstonde, Ful ycharged of her clay, Þat men clepeþ butumay, Þat water non ne may to-ryue, Ne jrne ne steel ne metal to-dryue, Who-so it tempreþ by powere, So it askeþ on his manere. Þoo he to his folk com, Þere was joye bitwene lorde and grom. Als swiþe þe kyng ?af bataille Vpon Taurunte, saunz faille, Of half his oost and sumdel moo By sexty dayes and fourty and twoo. Þerwhiles he dude his entent, Wiþ help of hem of Meapant, To stoppe þe cee of Caspias, Wharþorou? hij hadden her pas, Jn and out forto ride And robbe shippes wyde and syde, And oþer men of diuerse londe Forto don wrong and shonde (And out of þe londe ne mi?th ship go Bot bitwene roches two, Als hei?e as any man mi?th seen— Þat was two milen bitwen). Þe kynges kni?ttes þerwhiles dou?tty Vche day on þe londe fou?tty. He þere cast butumay, Of Meepant þat tou? clay, Wiþ pylers of metal stronge Þat ben an hundreþ feet longe, And made swiche a stronge muray Þat neuere in-tyl domesday Þere ne shal shippe out passe, Ne þe more ne þe lasse. Of þat dede he was wel bliþe, And on þe londe went swiþe And dude by strengþe stoppen þe pas Þat gooþ fro Tarunte to Caspias, For þere nas non oþer waye Bot ouere þe mountayne to þe sky on hei?e. Þis dude Alisaunder, par ma fay, Þorou? þe queyntise of his butumay. He bisette by cee and londe Wiþ butumay and metal stronge Taracunteys and Magogecas And a folk men clepeþ Getas, Alle blake so colowy bronde, And rou? as bere to þe honde. Turkes he bisette wiþ hem, Grete werreiours and dou?ty men, Shorte yswired, als J fynde, And boched tofore and bihynde. Dwerewes also he bisette, Þikke and shorte and grounde shette, Ac non so hei?, J þe telle, So þe lengþe of an elle. Ac none better werreiours men no noot Þan hij ben, la, God it woot! Wilflynges he bisette also— Merueillous men ben þoo— Wolues from þe nauel dounward, And men fro þennes vpward. By robberie hij lyuen and sekyng; Jn clyues is her woni?ing. Wiþ hem he bisette folk of Gogas, And al þe folk of Crisolidas, And folk of Grifayne and By[s]as, And to and twenty folk, naþelas, Euery fouler folk þan oþer, For by þe suster lijþ þe broþer, And by þe moder lijþ þe sone— Þat is a ful synful wone! Alle þise kyng Alisaunder haþ bishet, Mowen hij wers, mowen hij bett. Ne comen hij þennes o ne ay, Al forto tofore domesday. Antecrist shal come þanne And chesen hym vile menne, And shal afelle þorou? þe bleynes mi?th Al Alisaunders werk doun-ri?th, And alle þise folkes out wiþ hym lede, Al þe werlde to mychel quede. For þoo þat nylleþ his disciples bene Wiþ her teeþ hij shullen hem don tene. Now þe kyng haþ al þis in his rope, He shipped swiþe in to Ethiope, Forto seen þat folk selcouþ Jn wyde londes þat weren [c]ouþ. ?iueþ listenyng and beeþ now bliþe! Of wonder folk ?ee mowen nov liþe. In Ethiope is folk of selcouþ kynde, Als oure bokes habbeþ in mynde, And beeþ comen in luxure As ben bestes in pasture. Noman ne knowes þere oþer, Fader þe son, ne suster þe broþere. Oure book seiþ þat þilk men Ben ycleped Garmaiten. Jt ben þe loþlikest men on to seen Þat in þe werlde mowen ben. By hem woneþ a folk wel stronge— Vche of hem is tuelue feet longe; Wide and longe is her forchure. Serbotes hij hatten in lecture. Anoþer folk þere woneþ biside þis Þat beeþ y-cleped Cenophalis. Non of hem neuere ne swynkeþ, Ac vche of oþeres mylk drynkeþ. Ne shullen hij eten elles, Jch it wil avowe, Als longe as hij lybben mowe. Anoþer folk þere woneþ biside; Azachei men clepeþ hem wide— Li?tth men, wiþoute dotaunce. Olifauntz ben her sustenaunce; Olifauntz hij eten—þerby hij libbe, Fader and moder and al her sybbe. Anoþer folk þere is, stronge men and foule. Hij ben longe and blake and loken as an oule. Hij ne habbeþ camaile ne olifaunt, Ne cow ne hors auenaunt. An hounde hij crouneþ, at on word; Nillen hij babben non oþer lorde. To hym hij maken grete honouryng, For her god and for her kyng. Þis folk is ycleped Saubaris, Als Ich [y]wryte fynde, jwys. Anoþer folk woneþ þerby Þat ben yhoten Maritiny. Foure ei?en, by Goddes grace, Vche of hem bereþ in his face. Hij ben archers wiþ þe best, And sheten þe gripe in his nest. Foule and dere by ni?th and day Hij seen to sheten alway. Alle hij ben Sarazines, And leuen on Bachus and Appolynes. A folk þere woneþ in þe west half Þat eteþ noiþer cow ne chalf, Bot of panters and lyouns, And þat hij nymen as venysouns. Oþere fleshe ne oþer fyssh Ne oþere bred ne haue hij, jwys. Ferre men and oþer þerby Clepen hem Arriophagy. Of folk þere is biside on oþere gret prees; Hij ben ycleped wide Artapides. Non ne may vpri?th stonde, Ac crepen on foot and on honde Al so bestes, siker ?ee be. And whan hij willen þe walkne ysee, Hij turnen þe wombe vp ri?tth, And so hij han of þe walkne si?th. Anoþer folk bisyde is Visaged after hounde, jwys. Als beres hij ben rugh?e And berken as an hounde, Ich wil avowe. Wel hij louen al her lynage; Cinemolgris hij hatteþ in langage. Þise wonen in Ethiope west; Now listneþ of hem þat ben in þe est. Faire folk woneþ in Ethiope in þe est— Of al þe londe hij libben beest. Hij cloþen hem in skarlet and in grene, And drynken þe wynes rede and shene. Curteys hij ben of mete and of drynk, Wi?th and hardy to bataile and to swynk. Kynges hij habben of hem-selue, And dukes riche mo þan tuelue, Erles, kni?ttes, and burgeys— Jt is a londe of nobleys. Macrobij is here name; Of grete worschipp is her fame. Jn her londe is a cite, On of þe noblest of Cristiente. Jt hatte Saba in langage— From þennes com Sibile þe sage, Of al þe werlde þe fairest quene, To Jerusalem, Salomon to sene. For hire fairhede and for hir loue Salamon lete God aboue, And dude maumetes seruyse. Þere dude he nou?th as þe wise, Ac siþen he dude, verrayment, A?eins God amendement. Out also of þat cite Comen [on] dromedaries þe kynges þre, Þat foloweden Goddes sterre And brou?tten golde, ensense, and myrre, And presenteden oure dri?th Jn Cristemasse on þe twelueþ ni?th. Tygres, a fluuye of Paradys, Comeþ to þat cite, jwys. Þere is biside an hylle wel hei?e, Þat brenneþ boþe ni?th and deye, And shal don, par ma fay, Al fort it come domesday. Ouer þat londe nys bot desert, To Paradys terrestre, cert. Þerby-side on þe north-est Ben men of selcouþ gest. Þe face hij han playne and hard, Als it were an okes bord. Blake is her visage and lych, Als it were grounden pych. Ei?en hij han so arnement, And no nose, verreyment. Mouþe hij han grete and wide, And a tonge as a syde. So God me helpe at myne nede, Vnlouerede is þat kynrede. Anoþer folk bisiden is, Wiþ brode visage and pleyn, jwys. Ei?en hij han bri?th and clere, On oþer mennes manere, Ac hij ne han nose ne mouþe, Ne tooþ ne lippe—þat is selcouþe!— Bot a litel hole in her chyn, Where her wynde gooþ out and jn. Whan hij shullen notye ou?t selcouþ, A rede hij putten in her mouþ, And hij souken by þe rede— Jch wene it be mylk, so God me fede. Tunge ne haue hij non, jwis, To speken Latyn oiþer Englissh. Eueryche oþere vnderstonde By þe toknes of þe honde. Fyre is non in þat contreye; Neuere non of hem fire ne sei?e. Hij ben ycleped, men tellen me, Jn langage Orifine. Anoþere folk biside þere is Swiþe merueilous, jwys. Hij haue visages eue-long, And snatted nosen þat ben wrong. Eren hij haue an elle longe Þat byneþen þe girdel honge. Whan it snoweþ oiþer rineþ, Oiþer þe sonne to hote shyneþ, Onon-ri?ttes his eren wy[þ] Certes al his body wr[i?eþ], Þat noiþer wynde ne sonne mery Ne may noþing his bod[y] dery. Þise ben ycleped in Latyn Amonge clerkes Auryalyn. Anoþer folk biside þere wones— Jch wene it ben þe fendes sones. So ?elou? so wexe ben her visages; Jn þe werlde ne ben so vile pages. Rugh? hij ben also hounde, From þe heuede to þe grounde; Visages after martyn ape— Folk it is wel yuel yshape. Her mouþe from þe on ere to þe oþere; Her neþer lyppe is a ful foþere, For to þe nauel doune it hengeþ. And foule as caroyne hij stynkeþ: Alle hij ben mysfarynde, Boþe bifore and byhynde, Hij haue cloþing jnhoneste, As a dogge oiþer a beeste. Hij ben ycleped Garraman— Of þe werlde þe vileste man. Wel ofte Alisaunder agroos Er he had ywonne alle þoos, Ac so he chastede hem wiþ swerd Þat he was her aller lorde. Ac arst many of his kni?ttes gode Loren þe balles in þe hode. Now haþ he in Egipte yseye Al þat any man can bywreye. Þennes he went wiþ al his oost On a grene wood [a]cost. Verreyment, þere hij founde Wymmen growen out of þe grounde, Of summe þe heued potende out, Somme to þe breest, wiþouten dout. Somme weren to þe nauel ygrowe, And also somme to þe knowe. And summe weren ygrowe al out, And ?eden and romeden þere-about. Faire wymmen it beeþ of prijs— Her here her cloþing is, Also ?elewe as any golde, Als þe maistres vs haue ytolde. Weren hij yladde oiþer ybore Out of her londe, hij weren ylore. Þerfore men liggen hem by, And þan hij maken a reuly cry, And als swiþe comen her felawen, And al to peces hem todrawen. Þise wymmen in lettre blake Ben ycleped Erþe-drake. Of selcouþe folk ?ee haue yherd Þat woneþ in Egipte erd. Now ?ee mowen here gestes Boþe of wormes and of bestes, Þat kyng Alisaunder fande Þoo he went in Egipte lande. Sitteþ stille and ?iueþ listnynge, And ?e shullen here wonder þinge! Certes, Lordynges, Alisaunder þe kyng Wolde yseen al þing, Were it open, were it yleke, Þat he mi?th here of speke. He fonde, als þe boke telleþ vs, A beest in þe londe ycleped cessus. Horned it is als an oxe; Berde it haþ longe ywoxe. Jt haþ mannes feet byhynde; His feet tofore, als J fynde, Ben yliche mennes honde. Jt ne dredeþ noþing ne wondeþ. Jt is a beeste, als J fynde on boke, Wel griselich on to loke. Anoþere beeste also þere is, Þat hat rinoceros, jwis. Jt is more þan an olifaunt; Jn þe wilde wood is his haunt. Þe olyfauns in medle And þe lyouns it wil slee, For on his snoute an horne he beres Þat he sleeþ wiþ lyouns and beres. Þe horne is sharp als a swerd, Boþe by þe greyne and atte ord. A beeste þere is of more loos, Þat is ycleped monoceros. Jn marreis and redes is his wonyng; No beest ne abytt his fi?ttyng. Tofore ymade is his cors After þe fourme of an hors— Feet after an olyfaunt, cert, Heued he haþ als an hert, Tayl he haþ als an hogge, H[oke]d te[eþ] als a dogge. Þere nys to hym tygre ne lyoun Ne no beeste so feloun. He haþ in his frount an horne stronge; Grete and foure feet is it longe, Als Ich in holy book fynde— No rasoure so keruynde. He sleþ ypotames and kokedrille And alle bestes to his wille. Hounde ne beeste ne dar hym assaile, Ne non armed man, saunz faile; No man ne may hym lacche Bot by gyle and by snacche. Anoþer beeste þere is of yuel kynde, And griselich it is after þe fende. He schal sterue onon-ri?th Þat it may haue on si?th. Catapleba is her name. God vs shilde alle from shame! ?et þere ben emoten yfounden Þat ben more þan grehonden. Noman ne may hem nou?th ennoye, Bot he wil onon-ri?th deye. Ethiope and Aclante ben two londe— Bitwene hem renneþ a selcouþ stronde. From Nyl, a water from Paradys, Þennes he comeþ and hat Tigris. Jn tyme of wynter it is drye; Jn somer it ouerrenneþ þe cuntreie. Hij norissheþ delphynes and cokedrille, Of whom after telle ?ou Ich wille. Þere woneþ a folk of body lyte; Broune hij ben and noþing white, For hij ben wiþouten cloþes naked, And hardy hij ben and ful of wrake. Delphynes hij nymen and cokedrille, And affaiteþ hem to her wille, Forto beren hem in þe flood And on londe, ?if hem þinkeþ good. Þise ben stronge folk, jwys— Jn wynter ne eten hij flessh ne fyssh, Ne corne ne fruyt ne oþer þing, Ac hij lybben so þe heryng By þe water and engendreþ þere-inne. Feet and hondes beeþ her fynne. Hij comen on londe in somers tyde, And maken tentes, wyde and syde, And libben þan by flesshe and fyssh, Als oþere men don, jwys. Now listneþ (and sitteþ stille!) What beest is þe cokedrylle. He is strong and of grete valoure, And brode feet he haþ foure; Ac by kynde hem is bireued Þat hij ne haue no tunge in her heued. Eyren hij leggen as a griffoun, Ac hij ben more fer a-roum— Two and twenty feet he is long, And als an olyfaunt he is strong. Jn her mouþ ben teeþ trebble sshet— None bores better ywhett. Hij beren at ones þere it is good Ten men ouer þe flood. Þe delphynes woneþ [h]er biside, A stronge beeste of grete pride. Hij han shuldren on þe regge, Vche als sharp as rasoures egge. Whan þe delphyns þe cokedrille seeþ Anon togedres wrooþ hij beeþ, And smyteþ to-gedre anon-ri?th And makeþ þan a stronge fi?th. Ac þe delphyn is þe queyntere, And helte hym in þe water dounere, And whan þe cokedrille hym ouere swymme He rereþ vp his bristel grymme, And his wombe for-rant. Þus is þe cokedrille ysshant And yslaw?e of þe delphyn. God vs ?iue gode fyn! Many ben þe merueiles of Ethiope Þat Alisaunder haþ agrope. Þere he fonde a mount brennyng, And tiþinges herd of his endyng. Jt ne helpeþ nou?th al wel ysayed, Ac he was þere-of yuel ypayed. ?ut in Ethiope is a dych, Merueillouse and griselich. Ni?th and day þere is gradyng, Ac noman may see no quyk þing. Ac frost and snow comeþ out of holes, And brennande fire and gloweande coles. Þat snow for þat fire ne melt, Ne þat fire for þe snow ne swelt. Þis is now a wonder þing, Þat lasteþ to þis werldes endyng. Now haþ Alisaunder agrope Alle þe merueiles of Ethiope, And taken feute of þo men; To Ynde ?ut he wil a?ein. Bliþe þerof is kyng Porus. His baner takeþ Antiochus, On stede lepeþ Philotas; His spere takeþ Perdicas, His [mu]l[e] sporeþ Ennidus. His [sheld] enbraceþ Antigonus, His destrer prikeþ sir Clitoun; Nou?th byhynde is Salamoun. Duk, and prince, erle, and kni?th To Ynde ward so dassheþ ri?th To Faacen ward and heldes, By wayes and wodes, ouere feldes. Hij passeden by a quenes londe Þat hi?th Candace, J vnderstonde. Of al þe werlde she was richest; Of alle wymmen she was fairest. She loued Alisaunder pryuelik, And he hire, sikerlyk. Ac non of hem ne had oþere yseie, Jn halle, ne in boure, ne in weie. Jn þis viage he had yment Þat he wolde to hire haue went, Ac he lete for suspecioun And ?et more for tresoun, And forþ he went, Ich vnder-stonde, And passed þe quenes londe. Þoo þe quene þis vnderstood For fere of loue she brast nei? wood. She greiþed noble messagers, And sent hem on hei?e destrers And took hem lettre and bad hem bere To Alisaunder, and bryngen ansuere. Þe messagers to þe kyng went And t[o]ken hym þe lettre þat she sent. Hij weren swiþe welcome— Þe kyng þe lettre on honde haþ ynome. He braak þe seal and þe lettre seie— Þis was þe tenure, par ma feie: ‘To Alisaunder þe Emperoure, Of caysers prince, of kni?ttes floure, Þe quene Candace, wiþ al honoure, Sendeþ gretynges, par amoure. Alisaunder, dere sire! Ouer alle men J þee desire. Nyme me fore [alle] to þi quene. Riche shal þi mede bene— Jch wil chargen, saunz faile, Wiþ besauntz a þousande camayle. Jch wil ?iue þee ?ymmes and bi?es, Ten þousande carreyes. Jch wil chargen alle þine beestes Wiþ pelles and ciclatounes honestes. Jch wil þee ?iuen of gentyle-men Ten þousande wi?th Ethiopien, ?unge kni?ttes flumbarlynges, Wi?th in euery batayllynges, And an hundreþ þousande noble kni?th, To þi seruise, stronge and wi?th, And of rede golde a coroune bri?th Ful of preciouse stones ypi?th; Golde ne siluer, als Ich sigge, Ne mi?th þe stones to worþ bigge. ?ut þou shalt habbe sex hundreþ rinoceros, And fyue hundreþ olifauntz and sex hundreþ perdos, And two hundreþ vnicornes, And fyue hundreþ boles wiþ one horne, And foure hundreþ lyouns white, And a þousande þat wel connen byte, Olyfauntz and lyouns on playne, Stronge houndes of Albayne, And fyue hundreþ ceptres of golde, And my londe al to wolde, And an hundreþ þousande gentil squyers Þat connen þee serue in alle mesters, And þritty þousande maydens bri?ttes Forto seruen þine kni?ttes, Alle erles dou?ttres and barouns, Fulle of swiþe curteise wones. Oo, Alisaunder, þou riche kyng, Bee my lorde and my derlyng! Jch wil þee serue to honde and to fote By ni?th and day, ?if Ich mote.’ Of þis lettre was mychel prijse Wiþ Alisaunder and alle hise. Þe messagers a?ein he shiftes, And ?af hem swiþe riche ?iftes, And wiþ wordes debonaire Her ansuere swiþe faire. Þere was ycome wiþ þe messagers A queynt man, a metal ?eters, Þat couþe cast in al þing, And he avised wel þe kyng. And þoo he com hom, sikerliche, He cast a fourme þe kyng liche Jn face, in ei?e, in nose, in mouþ, Jn lengþe, in membres—þat is selcouþ! Þe quene it sette in her boure And keped it in grete honoure. Now rideþ Alisaunder his iourneiyng Wiþ mychel pride, wiþ mychel syngyng, Jn grete [delit], in solaceyng. Listneþ now of his metyng. Als þe kyng rode wiþ dukes and erles, He mette two hore cherles; To þe nauel her berde hyng, And þus aresoned hem þe kyng; ‘Seieþ me mow, ?ee olde hore! Many day is ?ee weren ybore. Wyten ?ee ouwhare, by any waies, Any merueiles in þis cuntreyes Þat Ich mi?th don in storye, Oþere men to haue of memorie?’ ‘?e, par fay!’! quoþ hee, ‘A gret merueille we tellen þee, Þat is hennes an euen weye Þe mountaunce of ten journeye. Þou shalt fynde trowes two— S[ey]n[t]e[s] and hol[y] hij ben boo. Here and in oþere cuntrees alle Arbre sek men done hem calle. ?if þou wilt þee þider di?tten, Þou mi?th wiþ þee lede fourti þousande kni?tten; Wiþ hem þou mi?th þee wel werye Þat wilde beestes ne shullen þe derye. Moo ne mi?ttou leden, saunz dotaunce, Bot þee failed sustenaunce.’ ‘Sir kyng,’! quoþ þe on, ‘by myne ei?e, Aiþer tree is an hundreþ feet hei?e— Hij stonden vp to þe skye. Þat on to þe sonne is sacrifyed; Þat oþere, we þee tellen nov, Js sacrified in þe mones vertv. Goo to hem and aske in herte Al þat þou wilt wite certe Of þee, oiþer of frende, oiþer of kynne, Oiþer of oþer straunge menne, And þou shalt here þe soþe onon, ?if þou wilt þider gon.’ Þe kyng by conseil of his beste Di?tte hym þiderward in haste, And sent wiþ Porus alle his men Jn to þe cite of Faacen. Bot fourty þousande wiþ hym he took, Als we fynden in þe book. Alisaunder so rideþ and wendeþ Þat he is comen þe trowes hende. Þe note-muge and þe setewale On hym smelleþ and þe galyngale; Þe caneil and þe lycorys Swete flauour ?iueþ, jwys, Þe gylofre, quybibbe, and mace, Gyngyuer, comyn, ?auen odour of grace, And vnder sonne of alle spyce Hij hadden sauoure wiþ delice. Þat londe was holy, hij vnderstoode, And ali?tten of her destreres gode, And ?eden on feet and many hij mette. Eueryche oþere faire grette. Of lyouns and panteren Alle her wedes, certes, weren. Habbeþ hij no wille to spynne— Her cloþes ben of bestes skynne. Þe bisshop þat was of þat londe Of þe kynges come haþ sonde. He graiþed hym and went þe kyng a?an. Hereþ now of a selkouþ man! Þe bisshop hi?th Longys, sikerlich; He was boþe blak and griselich, And rou? and shuldred also. His oo foot was more þan þe oþere two. He had bores tosshes and wide mouþ. Þe kyng of hym had selcouþ! He had of lengþe ten grete feet. Jn a lyouns skyn he was yshred; Of a beest þat hi?th pantere His hood was, and henge aboute his swere. Þe kyng wel faire þere he grett Also sone as he hym mett, And þe kyng hym seide, by gode reisoun, Of his comyng þenchesoun. What helpeþ it al to telle? Þe bisshop graunted al his wille, And shryueþ hym and alle þoo Þat shullen wiþ hym to þe trowes goo. Now is þe sonne ygon vnder. Þe bisshoppe ledeþ þe kyng to þis wonder, And þre þousande kny?ttes hym myde To þe trowes after ?ede. Ne sau?e he neuere so fair atoure, Ne ne smelled so swete odoure. At þe trowe of þe sonne Her sacrifise hij agonne. Þe bisshopp to þe kyng seide And to al his felaurede: ‘Kyng,’ he seide, ‘þis trowe honeste Askeþ offryng of none beeste, Neiþer of broches ne of rynges, Ne of mouþ crieynges. Bot in þine herte þenke al þi wille, And þou it shalt wite snelle. For, biholde! vp ri?th þi steuene Js yherd in to heuene.’ Þe kyng sei? a leem so fire-bronde From þe trow jn to heuene stonde. A-knowe he gan onon falle Adoune þere wiþ his kni?ttes alle, And þou?th ?if he shulde þe werlde wynne forth, Est and west, south and north, ?if he shulde to Grece a?ein wende To seen his moder and his frende. Þe tree hym ansuered a?ein, Jn langage of Yndyen: ‘Kyng Alisaunder, Ich telle þee cert, Of al þe werlde þe þrid part Þou shalt wynne and ben of kyng. Ac selcouþ worþe þine endyng. To my langage vnderstonde! Ne comestou neuere in Grece londe; Moder ne suster ne þi kyn Ne shaltou more in Grece yseen. [Er] þou ware in þi be[?etynge], Of godes it was þin destenyng. For al þe werlde, Ich sigge þee, Oþer wise ne mi?th it bee.’ Þoo þe kyng yherd þis, For doel he chaunged colour, jwys; Woo was hym for þat ansuere And þat it had yherd so fele, Ac þoo men mi?tten seen ynowe Dukes and barouns falle aswowe! Here her teren lesse and more, Beten ho[n]den and wepen sore, And byweileden his prouesse, His ?ongþe, his strengþe, his largesse. Þe kyng gan sigh?e swiþe sore, And bad hem stille lesse and more. He hem solaced and bad ben stille— He most nedes suffre þe goddes wille. He hi?th hem au?tte and grete nobleis: Hij shulden it hele and ben in peis. He took þe bisshopp onon-ri?th, For it was after þe myd-ni?th, And wenden hem also sone To þe tree of þe mone. Þre kni?ttes he dude wiþ hym goo Of his pryueest and nomoo, Þat hi?tten Dytonas, Philotas and Perdicas; Þere ne weren moo ne las. Þe kyng and his kni?ttes kneleden, certe, And þus he seide in his herte: ‘Tree fair, J bidde þee, By þi leue telle þou me Whan J shal sterue, in gode fey, Where and in whiche cuntrey?’ Þe tree hym ansuered in Gru resoun: ‘Þou schalt sterue in Babiloun, Þorou? envie and by tresouns Tofore alle þine barouns. Jn þe nexte ?er here-afterward Þou shalt suffre deeþ wel hard!’ Þoo wepe þe kyng and hise yfere And maden swiþe reuly chere. His wytt he for?ate for sorou? And ?ede ligge forto a-morou?. His kni?ttes of Grece and of Perce Woo and sorou? gonnen reherce, Wepen and her cloþes totare— Noman ne sei? neuere swiche care! Philotas þoo to þe kyng cam, And þe tale for hem alle nam. ‘Sir,’ he seide, ‘vnderstonde! We ben wiþ þee in stronge londe. Jt beeþ nou?th alle oure frende Þat vs ben now yhende. We habbeþ many pryuee foo, Þat wolde of on harme twoo, And willen fonde to greuen vs, Bot þou þee make vigourous. Þat þou herdest is fayrye— Ne hastou herte and flesshe hardye? Lete be, sir, swiche mournynge, And goo conforte þine gynge.’ Kyn Alisaunder, þou? hym were woo, Þoo took gode herte hym to. Vp he rist, and to his folk gooþ, Makeþ hym bliþe, and noþing wrooþ, Eteþ and drynkeþ, plaieþ and scoff Als he ne ?af noþing þerof. For he made hym bliþe and li?th, Michel ioye maden his kni?tt. Al was for?eten sorou? and care— Þat day hij leten forþ fare. Þoo it was eft-sones ni?th, Þe kyng com to þe bisshop ri?th, And seide he had for?ete Þing þat he wolde wyte, And þe þrid tyme to hym seide He shulde hym to þe tree lede Þat was cleped of þe sonne, For more fayn he wolde conne. Þe bisshope graunted hym his wille, And led hym þider swiþe stille. Creature non wiþ hem was, Bot þe trew Perdicas, And þoo he com vnto þe tree, He fel sone vpon his knee, And þou?th þus, in grete feye: ‘Tree, Ich bidde to me þou seye Whan Ich shal hennes teen, And who shal my traitour been?’ Þe tree ansuered, wiþ grete jre: ‘Parfay! þou art a selcouþ sire, And askest þing a?eins skyl. Now is þe tyme of Aueryl— Þou shalt libbe al þis ?are, Bot nou?th wiþouten grete care. Þou shalt al wel ouerecome. A[c] þine endyng shal ben nome Jn þe nexte ?er, als Ich þe tache, Þe foure and twentiþe day of Marche. Þou shalt deþ by poysoun þole— Þi traitour shal ben for-hole. Ne mi?ttou nou?th wite þi foo, For Cloto, Lachesis, and Antropo, Þe sustren, it shopen þee. Nomore, Ich hote þee, aske þou me! Goo out of oure wode snelle, For nomore nyl J þee telle.’ Þoo þe kyng þamonestment herd, Quyklich þennes he ferd And, als we fyndeþ on þe book, At þe bisshope his leue he took, For he woot his certeyn day. He wil fonde ?if he may, Þei? it be to hym yshape, On sum manere forto a-skape. He went vnto his ost honest And makeþ hym a riche fest, And cryeþ loude and dooþ crye Noman ne leue þat fayrye, Ac eueryche man it nyme a-skoff, For he ne telleþ no tale þerof. Þoo þou mi?ttest on many wise Yseen solace and game aryse, Leigh?en, syngen, and daunces make, Dysoures talen and resouns crake. Swiche chaunce þe werlde kepeþ— Now man leig?eþ, now man wepeþ! Now man is hool, now man is seek; Nys no day oþer ylyk. Noman þat lyues haþ borowe From euene libbe forto amorowe. Averille ?iues mery shoures; Þe foules syngen and springen floures. Many hokett is in amoures! Stedfast seldom ben lecchoures. Hote loue often after wil soure. Fair juel is gode nei?boure. Þe best þing is God to honoure. Alisaunder nyl nomore loure— He hoteþ quyklich alle his men Trusse to grete Faacen, And seide: ‘Lordynges, makeþ no tale Of þe trowes wode gale. ?ee witen wel þat Pore, certe, Bereþ to me yuel herte. He bereþ to me non amoure, For Ich byname hym his tresoure. Queed and harme he wil me spye, Oiþer par auenture me defye, ?if he woot of þis trigoldrye Þat þise trowes connen lye. Alle þoo men þat ben of Ynde Wenen me a god to fynde; Þerfore hij nyllen, saunz fayle, A?eins me taken batayle. ?if hij wenden þat Ich man ware, A?eins me fi?tten hij weren ?are. Þerfore heldeþ ?ou stille, And ?ee shullen haue al ?oure wille.’ Forþ hij wenten, grete and smale, Passeden dounes and many dale, And in þe valey of Jordon Hij founden addren, many on. Grete dragons also þere waren, Þat emeraudes in mouþes baren. Of hem is wel gret ferly— Þe white peper hij libben by. [Here herd] Pore [to] hy[m] vnwreen Þat Alisaunder ne shulde Grece seen, And on þis tiþing took conseile Þat hym nas noiþere good ne heile, For þorou? þis ilk tydyng He forsook Alisaunder þe kyng. Alisaunder suffred grete peynes Jn valeyes and vpe mountaynes. Þe paaþ on mount was narewe and steep; Jn dales he was, derk and deep. Þe waye was euere vp and doune, Amonge þe addres and dragoun. At þe seuen ni?ttes ende He fonde a folk gentil and hende— Sereses is her name. Ne connen hij of no shame; Hij ben trewe and stedfast, Mesurable, boneire, and chast. Ne shal þere non oþer yknawe, Bot it be by ri?th lawe. Her mete is bred, herbe, and water; Naked hij gon, wiþouten hater. Nis þere non of oþer agramed, Ne for þair nakedhede ashamed. Wiþouten lust of synne hij streneþ. Alisaunder hem bymeneþ Þat hij ne hadden werldes manhede To her oiþer godhede. Þise vnderfengen þe emperoure, And duden to hym alle honoure, And founden to hym al despense Jn mete and drynk wiþ reuerence, And leden hym by siker paas Al to þe gates of Caspyas. Þise Sereses, als J fynde, Þe vppest folk ben of al Ynde. Hij habben sylk, grete plente, And maken cloþes of grete deynte, And gon hem-seluen liche bare. Þis is now a selcouþ fare! Whan þere comeþ marchaundise, Wiþ corne, wiþ wyne, wiþ steel, wiþ yse, To her londe any shippe, To house hij willen sone skippe. Ac þei? þe marchaunt sette out his ware Jn þe strete and away fare, And a-morowe come þider a?ene, Al away he shal fynde it clene. Ac of pelys and baudekyn, And riche cloþes of sylk fyn, He shal fynde worþ trebble prise For his owen marchaundise. To shippe he may hem beren and teen— More ne shal he of hem seen. Alisaunder is at Caspias, And þere he agynneþ a selkouþ pas, For þere he fyndeþ latymers Þat leden hym to hei?e rochers, To rochers and to wildernesse. He fonde hard waie and grete destresse— Þere he fonde addren and monoceros, And a fel worme, cales, and manticeros, And broune lyouns and ek white, Þat wolden fayn his folk abite. Vnicornes hij founden in þat wastayne, Felle beres and ek wilde swyne, And croched dragons, saunz fayle, Þat ?auen hem alle stronge batayle. Þei? men slou?en fele of hem, Hij slow?en fele of þe kynges men. Bestes þere weren þat cades heten, Þe kynges men þat fast freten. Alisaunder, als J fynde, Lese þere þritty þousynde Of hise kni?ttes and moo ynowe, Þat wilde bestes to-drowen and slow?e— Fyue hundreþ also fyfty and fyue Þat þere leten her lyue, For cades was a ferly beste. Þries shett teeþ weren in his teste; Al þat he oftook he shent— Slou? and frete oiþer al to-rent. Alisaunder of his folk al Ne had nou?th þe fierþe dal, For he had on þat rocher Ylore many a conseiler, Many duk, prince, and erle, Many baroun, kni?th, sweyn, and cherle. Alle lyggen in þe wastyne, Yslaw?e wiþ bestes and vermyne. Þe kyng ne þoled so gret damage Neuere er in al his viage. To a wood he flei? vnneþe, Forto askape þere þe deþe. Þere he dude his meignee alle Abouten þe diches maken walle, And holde hem wiþinne wiþ grete wardynges, For doute of þe foule þinges. Whiles þe kyng in his tapynage Sent after Antioche þe ostage And his marshal Tholomeu, Þat many prince wyde kneu, And bad hij shulden bryngen onon To hym his meignee euerychon, And tolde hem by wrytt his damage Þat he had þoled in þat syluage. Whan þe kyng haþ message sent, Þe cuntre to seen he is went. On his honde stant a speruers. He seeþ faire medes and ek ryuers, Large wodes and ek hei?e, Gode londe, aysee cuntre. On a pleyne he cheseþ a place Þat biclippeþ a mychel space. Sex and sexty milen aboute Jt contened, saunz doute. Abouten he maked a wal stronge Þat sex and sexty milen was longe. Wiþinne þe walles he dude house And made þe stretes merueillouse. Of his gentyl-men he herited þare, And þo þat of þe londe ware, And ?af þe toun a name of prys— Alisaunder, after hym-seluen, jwys, Þat is now cite þe noblest Of Ynde londe, and þe best. Now is comen þe tidyng To Tholomew from þe kyng. Mychel doel hij maken alle, And trussen boþe in boure and halle, And in þe next daweyng Done hem toward her kyng. So hij riden from day to ni?th Þat nei? þe kyng hij ben yti?th. Þoo hij to Alisaunder weren come, More and fairer þan is Rome, And whan þe kyng it vnderstood, Michel blisse was in his blood. He made hem faire welcomeynge. Þere was clyppyng, þere was kyssynge! Þere was ostel lyuerynge, Of al newe byggeynge. Ayþer telleþ oþer tiþing Of her fare, of her libbyng. Hij resten hem by longe tydes, And wel ofte on ryuer rides. Porus bileueþ at Faacen And ofsendeþ alle his men, Boþe dukes and barouns, Of al Ynde regiouns, And seide: ‘Ich pleyne me, lordyng, To ?ou of Alisaunder þe kyng. He haþ afelled al myne honoure; He haþ robbed my tresoure. He haþ taken myne castels; He haþ afelled myne tourels. Now hym is fallen chaunce hard— He haþ nei? lorne al his ferd. Wilde bestes habbeþ yslawe His gode kni?ttes and to-drawe; Fourty þousande al-mast Hij han yslawe in wilde wast. Now Ich wil hym defye, And haue of hym þe maistrie— Wiþ swerd hym slee oiþer wiþ knyue, Oiþer out of my londe hym dryue. J þe hote, dan Thorolde, And þou, Phares, þat art so bolde, ?eldeþ hym my feute. J ne kepe wiþ hym no leute— Siggeþ hym Jch hym defye, Wiþ swerd and hardy chyualrye! Of hym more helde J nelle. Jch hym defye, gooþ hym telle!’ Þise dukes riden in her waye By dounes, by dales, many journeye. Alisaunder romeþ in his toun, And deuiseþ to his masoun Þe toures maken and þe torels, Vavtes, alures, and þe kirnels. Þan comen þise dukes swiftly flynge, And brou?tte Alisaunder tydynge. Hij weren men of gent parage, And hadden sexty wynter of age. Togedre hij nymen her hondes, And wenden þere þe kyng hym stondes, And seiden first, wiþ mourny[n]g cheres: ‘Sire, we beþ ymade messangers. We ne shullen, by ri?th lawe, No qued habben for oure sawe.’ Kyn Alisaunder knew ades Boþe Thorold and Phares, And seide to hem: ‘Frendes honeste, Telleþ me ?oure lordes heste. Be he fole, be he wijs, ?ee ne shulle non harme haue, jwis.’ Thorold seide: ‘Porus wrooþ is, And seide ?ee don mychel amys Þat ?ee ?ou make lorde and sire Nei? and fer of his empire, Citees makeþ, walles rare, He dredeþ hym al to his care. ?ee haue hym twyes y-ouercome, And al his tresore hym bynome. He wiþclepeþ al homage, And sendeþ ?ou by sonde gage, And defyaunce by oure honde, And hoteþ ?ou remve out of his londe.’ Alisaunder gynneþ leigh?e smale, And þus he gynneþ to hem his tale: ‘Jch wil proue wiþ spere and swerd Of þis londe þat Ich am lord. Porus weneþ Ich be amayed, For his gyoures me han bitrayed And of my poeple haue forlore; And jn þat he is forswore. Al þe lere in hym Ich rette— J shal ?elde ful wel his dette! ?ut Ich habbe lyues, saunz fables, Alle myne twelue conestable. He haþ ysponnen on þrede Þat is ycome of yuel rede. ?ut Ich habbe an hundreþ þousynde— None better kni?ttes ne ben in Ynde— Redy to proue wiþ vigoure Þat he is a traytoure. And ?if he dooþ als Ich wille, Hise ne myne ne shullen spille, For aqueyntaunce þat haþ ben Fer and neer hem bitwene, A[c] take we boþe swerd and sheld And flyngen on stedes in þe feld, And þere don boþe strengþe and gynne Who þat wil oþer wynne. For his barouns and for myne Þis were þe ri?ttest lyne.’ Wel he knew þoo barouns tweye, And shewed hem al þe cuntreye, Of his folk þe pyte, And þatyre of þat cite. He held hem þare dayes foure, And sent hem hom wiþ gret honoure. Þe messageres so swiþe wendeþ. Alisaunder his barouns ofsendeþ And þis defyeyng gynneþ hem telle, And hij hym conseileþ also snelle: ‘Wendeþ swiþe after hem, Þat [?e] weren at Faacen.’ Hij trussen alle in þe daweynge, And maken swiþe after wendynge. Torold and Phares ben comen hom— A?eins hem comen lorde and grom, Forto heren what tidyng Hij brou?tten from Alisaunder þe kyng. Þe messageres ben comen to halle Tofore Porus and þe barouns alle, And seiden: ‘Porus, we ben ycome From Alisaunder þe riche gome, And ha[þ] afonge þi defieyng. He sent þee by vs tidyng He nylle þat ?oure barouns ne his Ne beren carke of al þis, And ?ut he may to bataile fynde Of dou?tty kni?ttes twenty þousynde. Ne wil he nou?th þine amere, Ne þat þine hise dere, Ac ?ee two wiþ hors and sheld Comen y-armed wel on feld. ?if he wynneþ þere þe maistrie, On vs is þe disconfiterie. ?if þou hym by force aquelle, His folk willen don þi wille. ?ee þat chalangeþ al to habbe Bituene ?ou deleþ it wiþ dabbe And wiþ spere and swerdes dynt. Þis is Alisaunders juggement.’ Prince and duk, baroun and kni?th, Seiden þe juggement was ri?th, And þat it nas neuere ydi?th Wiþouten herte of noble kni?th, And who-so were þere-a?an, He ne haþ herte of no wi?th man. Porus stant and is agramed; He nolde nou?th ben yblamed. Colour he chaungeþ sumdel for drede, And wiþ grete yre to hem se[i]de: ‘Lordynges, ?if ?ee weren gent, To me fel þe juggement. Ac for ?ee recchen of me lyte, Of me ?ee habbeþ ?ou aquyte. Ac naþeles Ich woot, j-wys, Stronger Ich am þan he is, And more in euery bon also. A?eins hym J dar go, Falle it to nesshe oiþer to hard; Ne shal Ich neuer be coward.’ By þat þis was fullich seide Alisaunder was in a mede Ycome boldelich wiþ alle his men Tofore þe cite of Faacen. Þere was quyk many tent ysett, Many corde to pauyloun knett, Many banere out ypylt, And many shelde wiþ bestes ygilt. Eteþ and drynkeþ on ayse apli?th And resteþ hem þat ilk ni?th, And ben so warded al aboute Þat hem ne stondeþ none doute. Amorowe, als Ich haue ysade, Þis couenaunt was bituene hem made Þat þe bataille shulde ben Porus and Alisaunder bitwen. Who-so oþere wynne mi?th Jn batayle, wiþ strengþe of fi?th, He shulde haue al Ynde lande, And al þat folk vnder his hande. Alisaunder hym gan affye Jn his owen chyualerie, And wist wel in sooþ forhole Þat he ne shulde þe deþ þole. Porus affied in his strengþe, Jn his mychelhede and in his lengþe. Þis disrayne by þe barouns Ymade is of boþe regiouns— Habbe who þe maystry may, Afermed fast is þis disray. Ostage is taken and treuþ ypli?th. Now hereþ of þise kynges fi?th! Good it were to ben kni?th, Nere tourneyment and dedly fi?th. Wiþ marchaundes to ben it were hende, Neren þacountes at bordes ende. Swete is loue of damoysele, Ac it askeþ costes fele. Better is litel to habbe in ayse þan mychel agh?tte in malayse. Who-so is of dedes vntrewe, Ofte it shal hym sore rewe. Alisaunder is comen a-feld, Wel y-armed vnder sheld, On a stede wel ydi?th, And sitteþ as a noble kni?th. He rideþ his spere braundynde; Þe pensel rateleþ wiþ þe wynde. Porus also comeþ flynge, Ygraiþed als a riche kynge, Y-armed wel on kni?ttes wise. Nis it no nede her armes deuyse, Ac her aiþer lete go þe reyne, And dasshen togedre wiþ grete meyne. Þe speres to-brosten a?eins þe sheldes. Hij dasshen ouer in þe feldes— Hij turnen a?ein quyklich. Wiþ drawen swerdes, sikerlich, Aiþer oþere legeþ on, Als þe mason on þe ston, Ac als hij skirmeden to þe cors Her aiþer slou? oþeres hors. Þoo hij mosten on fote beye Disreynen her medleye. Gayneþ it nou?th of rest preche— Her aiþer gynneþ oþer seche, Wiþ assailyng, wiþ smytynge, And kepen hem wiþ wrieynge. Wel hij fi?tten on þe pleyn, Wiþ tresget, wiþ reremeyn, Wiþ ouerheued and wiþ stook. Aiþer on oþere þe swerd so shook, Nyste noman hem bitwene ?ut who shulde maister bene, For her armes, riche of mounde, Weren ?ut hole and sounde. Ac eft now, after restynge, Hij bigynnen togedres dynge, To-keruen her armes and her shelde— Þe peces wounden in þe felde. Ne sei? man neuere kni?ttes two So manlich togedres goo! Her aiþer fast gynneþ aspye To don oþer vilanye Oiþer wiþ stoke oiþer wiþ dynte— Þat is al hir entente. Whiles hij weren in swiche mangle, Þe Yndyens bigonnen jangle. Porus bigan a-bacche reme, And name þiderwardes ?eme And loked toward her cry, Ac Alisaunder was sone hym by, And smoot hym in þe discouerte Wiþ a stooke al to þe herte, Fast by þe chyne-bon; Porus fel ded onon. Yndyens comen wiþ drawen swerd To socouren her lord. Alisaunder gan loude crye: ‘Be non of ?ou so hardye A?eins couenaunt me to assaile, Bot ?ee willen newe bataile And ?oure ostages todrawe, And ?ou self to deþ yslawe. For ben ?ee sele, ben ?ee wroþe, Ynde and Perce ben myne boþe. ?eldeþ me homage alle, Oiþere ?ou shal qued bifalle!’ Princes and dukes token her red, Þoo hij sei?en Porus ded, And token Alisaunder by þe honde And ?elden hym þe coroun of Ynde londe. Hij duden hym alle feute, And sworen to hym also leute. Now is ded þe kyng Porus— Alisaunder is kyng glorious. He ?iueþ londes, he ?iueþ rentes, Stedes, tresores, warnementes, Makeþ justise and conestable, And ouer al his law?e stable, And wendeþ out of Faacen To newe Alisaunder wiþ alle his men, And dooþ ful-make þe stronge walles, Castels, toures, boures, halles, Makeþ þe strete brode and riche, Þat non oþer hir nys liche. O[n a] day sone after þan, Com Candulek, a gentil-man— Candaces son, kyng of Brye— Wiþ wel faire chyualrye, And wolde wiþ Alisaunder speke, Forto ben þorou? hym awreke Of a prynce þat by strijf Had bynomen hym his wijf. Ac Alisaunder had a wone, Þei? to court com kyng oiþer his sone, Prynce, oiþer duk, oiþer gret caiser, Kni?th oiþer sweyn, oiþer messagere, He ne shulde nou?th þe kyng ysee Bot it were by atturne. Now is hym tolde þat wiþ hym speke Wolde þe kyng Canduleke. Tholomew, þat is nexte þe kyng, So hym seiþ þis tydyng, And Alisaunder makeþ a stille cry Þat non ne be so hardy To ben aknowe to Candaces son Who be þe kynges person, Ac þat hij shulden euerychon Clepen þe kyng Antygon. He dude on Tholomew, verrayment, Quiclich his vestement. And sette hym in þe kynges deys, And he took Tholomeus herneys, And made hym in hei? mester Þe kynges first conseiler. Hij clepen and siggen Canduleke He shulde wiþ þe kyng speke. He comeþ quyk on boþe his knewes And kneleþ tofore Tholomewes, Ac for he was a gentyl gome He was sone vp ynome. His pleynte he telleþ in þe manere Als ?ee mowen now yhere. ‘Alisaunder, riche caysere, Þou ne haste on erþe no pere! Many is þe riche londe Þou hast ywonne to þine honde. On þee hij ben wel bysett, For þou art ful of þewes pett. Þou batest wronge, þou hauntest ri?ttes; Þou art fader of alle kni?ttes. Þou louest alle gentil-manne And abatest alle tyranne. Þou art caiser of þis londe— Jch me ?elde to þine honde, And amendyng J bidde þee to Of vnri?th þat is me do!’ ‘Telle on þi wronge,’ quoþ Tholomay, ‘We shulle þe helþe ?if we may.’ ‘Sir, graunt mercy! þerwhiles J was fare On pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Yndare, Þe duk Hirtan, a tyraunt of Brye, Com wiþ grete chyualrie, Robbed my make Blasfame, Also fair as was Dyane. She is my quene, Ich hire chalenge. Of þis despyt helpe me avenge!’ ‘Hou fele kni?ttes, as þou wenes, Mi?tten awreken þine tenes?’ ‘Of foure þousande Ich had ynowe To awreken myne wowe.’ Tholomeus gynneþ grade onon: ‘What seistou here-of, Antigon?’ Alisaunder seide: ‘For þat þis gome Js to vs from fer ycome And to ?oure frenderede trest, J rede ?ou þe conseil best, Þat ?e lene to his socoure Swich folk þat ben to ?oure honoure, And faileþ hym nou?th at þis nede.’ ‘Nay,’ quoþ Tholomeu, ‘so God me fede, Wende wiþ hym,’ he seide, ‘Antigon, And hym wreke on his fon, For þou art wi?th, hardy, and stronge— Not Ich better vs amonge. J þee biteche þe bayllye My [folk] wiþ hym to conduye.’ Alisaunder hem fawe afongeþ. Ne wolde he bileue longe— Ygreiþed ben his foure þousynde Quyklich and on hors wende. Wiþ Canduleke he wendeþ swiþe. His kni?ttes maden chere bliþe, For her lorde in tapynage Was ywent in þat veiage. So he rideþ dales and doune Þat he seeþ þat cite-toune Where hym heldeþ þe duk Hirtan, Þat haþ Candulek[e] lemman. Canduleke seiþ: ‘Sir Antygon, Hou shullen we now taken on?’ Bote quoþ Alisaunder, ‘Here and þere Tofore vs sette al on fyre, Forto hij comen to vs a-felde, Oiþer þat lefdy to vs ?elde.’ Hij setten a-fyre, wiþouten pyte, Al þe londe to þe cite, And bysetten it aboute Þat hij ne mi?tten jn ne oute. Þe burgeys sei? her wynes barne— Eueryche oþer harme gan warne, And seiden wel her was þe gylt To ben forbarnd, to ben forswelt, Þat suffreden þe duk Hirtan Haue in demayne oþere womman. Alle þe burgeis of þe toun Duden by on red commune— To þe palays hij wenten alle And quyk beten doune þe walle, Jn cuntek and slou?en Hirtan, And ?ulden to Candulek his womman. Þus comen þise burgeis, And han of her werre peis. After soiour of fourtene ni?th, To kynges court hij done hem ri?th, And fynden Tholomeu, als he was bede, Sette in Alisaunders stede. Candulek on knowe hym sett, And þe kyng oft he grett, And þanked hym of his socour, Þorou? whiche he had his honour Yconquered and his quen. He was vptaken of gentil-men, And ysette on hei?e benche, And wyne and pyement gynneþ shenche, And wyne clarre and wyne Greek, And þoo seide Tholomeu to Candulek: ‘Sir’, he seide, ‘men tellen me Þou hast a moder fair and fre. She is yhote dame Candace; Fair and bri?th is hir face— Nis in þis werlde so fair quene. Fayn Ich wolde hir ysene, Her castels and ek her toures, ?if hij weren to myne honoures.’ Quoþ Candulek: ‘Leue sire, Also mychel she ?ou desireþ— Jch ?ou sigge, by Goddes ore, She desireþ noþing more Þan to ben to ?ou aqueinte. Ne habbeþ now none herte feinte— Now is tyme it to done. Jch wil ?ou brynge þider sone. Ne be it ?ou for my broþer looþ, Þei? he be wiþ ?ou wrooþ For ?ee duden Porus of lyue, Whas dou?tter he haþ to wyue. For on honde Ich wil hym take Þat he shal don ?ou no wrake.’ Tholomeus ?af ansueryng Jn þe name of þe kyng, And seide: ‘J nyl nou?th comen hir ner, Bot by a speciale messager J wil hir sende loue-drurye, And her estres ek aspye’, And cleped Alisaunder ‘Antygon’, And bad hym wende wiþ hym onon, And rouned wiþ hym a grete while. Ac al þat was for gyle! After þis queynt rounyng, Alisaunder spedde in þis doyng. Quyk on hors went wiþ hym ek Þoo þat he had myd Candulek. Candulek was wel bliþe— Quyk he ladde hem and swiþe. Whan hij in to Saba come, To þe paleys waie hij nome. Þe lefdy wandreþ in a plas, And syngeþ of Dido and Eneas, Hou loue hem ladde by strange bride. Comeþ Candulek tofore ride, And seiþ: ‘Ma dame, beeþ redy, And welcomeþ here myne amy, Kyng Alisaunder messagere, Noble kni?th of gent manere. He haþ ?olden me my wyf, And duk Hirtan brou?th of lyf. Kyng Alisaunder ne haþ to gye Non f[o]ller of chyualerye.’ Ar her tale were at þe ende Kyng Alisaunder com hem hende. Quyk hij ben of horses ali?th— Þe lefdy comeþ onon-ri?th, And clippeþ hym in armes tueye, And he hir, wiþ grete joye. She hym þankeþ of Candulek, And of his gentil wyue ek, And he hire bryngeþ many gretyng On Alisaunder halue þe kyng. ‘Do way!’ quoþ þe quene Candace, ‘Jch vnderstonde by þi face Þat þou Alisaunder be. Ne hele þ[ou] nou?th, sir, for me!’ ‘Nay’, he seide ‘by Goddes ore! Alisaunder is wel more, Redder man on visage, And sumdel more of age, And þou shalt certeyn ben, Sumday whan þou shalt hym sen!’ ‘Depart-dieux!’ quoþ þe quene, ‘Go we now myne estres sene. Oure mete shal þerbituene Ygreiþed and redy bene.’ She led hym to chaumbres of nob[l]eys— Þere he dude of his herneys. Of Troye was þere-inne al þe story, Hou Gregeis hadden þe victory. Þe bemes þere-inne weren of bras, Þe wyndewes of riche glas. Þe pynnes weren of yuory. Þe kyng went wiþ þe lefdy, Hym-self al one from boure to boure, And sei? wel mychel tresoure, Gold, and siluer, and preciouse stones, Baudekyns made for þe nones, Mantles, robes, and pauylouns, Of gold and siluer grete foysouns. And she hym asked, par amour, ?if he sei? euer swiche tresour; And he seide in his contreye Tresour he wist of swiche nobleye. She þou?th more þan she seide, And ledde hym to anoþer stede, To hire owen chaumbre þat was— Jn al þis werlde fairer non nas. Þe atyre was þere-inne so riche Jn al þis werlde was non it liche. She led hym to one stage, And shewed hym an ymage, And seide: ‘Alisaunder, yleue me! Þis ymage is made after þee. J dude it an ymageoure Casten after þi vigoure, Þis oþere ?er þoo þou nolde To me come for loue ne golde. Jt is þee als liche, my leue broþer, Als any peny is anoþer. O, Alisaunder, of grete renoun! Þou art ytake in my prisoun! Al þi strengþe ne gayneþ þe nau?th, For a womman þee haþ ycau?th. A womman þee haþ in her laas!’ ‘O!’ quoþ Alisaunder, ‘Allas, Þat J nere y-armed wel, And had my swerd of b[r]oun steel. Many an heued wolde J claue Ar J wolde in prisoun laue. Ac noman ne may hym waite From þise wymmens dissaite.’ ‘Alisaunder’, she seide, ‘þou seis sooþ. Ne be nou?th adradde ne þerfore wrooþ— Myne tale þou mi?th yleue. Adam was biswike þorou? Eue, And Sampson also, þe stronge, Dalida hym dude wronge. And Dauid was brou?th in exyl Þorou? his wijf Abygayl. And Salomon, for wommans loue, Forlete his lorde þat is aboue. And þou art fallen in hondes myne, Þee to solas and to no pyne, For here, vnder þis couertoure, Jch wil haue þine amoure, To my baundon, leue sire! Longe it haþ ben my desire. Ne shaltou haue oþer skaþe, Bot me to baundon late and raþe.’ Þoo Alisaunder gan ysee Þat it most so nedes be, He dude al þe lefdyes wille Vnder couertoure stille. Many ni?th and many day Þus hij duden her play— Jn halle at table he sat hire by, Jn chaumbre gest, in bed amy. Antygon he hi?th in halle, And Alisaunder vnder palle. Longe hij han þus ypleiede. On a day it was yseide To Candidus by on stodmere, Candaces son þe ?ongere, Þat had Porus dou?tter to spouse, A fair lady and delitouse, Þat Alisaunder sat at his boord, Þat had yslawe Porus his lord, And dude hym clepen Antigon. To þe quene he stirte onon, And seide: ‘Ma dame, þou hast wrong Þou heldest here Alisaunder so long. He haþ yslaw?e my lorde Pore— Myne honde ne skapeþ he neuermore!’ ‘Pes!’ quoþ Candace, ‘þou congeoun! Jt is Antigon, a gent baroun, Þat is ycome to message. Ne bede þou hym non outrage! ?if þou doost, by God aboue, Þou shalt for-lese myne loue!’ ‘Dame, whom so Ich euere serue, Of myne honde he shal sterue. Alisaunder hym-seluen it is, And haþ ychaunged name his.’ ‘Nartou so hardy’ quoþ Candace ‘More to seen Candulekes face. And þou dude hym ou?th bot good, He wolde sen þine herte blood, And Ich my-self, for þat wronge, Hei?e wolde þee don anhonge. For messagere to me ysent Ne shal here fynde encumbrement.’ Candidus wrooþ went away, And com a?ein nou?th many a day. Þo þe table was ydrawe Þe wayte gan ‘A choger!’ blawe. Alisaunder and Candace To chaumber token her trace, And, als we fynden on þe book, Þat ni?th þe kyng his leue took, And went to Ynde to his barouns, By wodes, by dales, and by douns. Leue he had wiþ mournyng, And went forþ in a daweyng By an hei?e waie þat he knew, Forto he com to Tolomew. He was welcomed many a siþe— Al his ost was wel bliþe Þoo hij hadden of hym si?th. Ne duelled he bot one ni?th; Amorowe he dude hym, wiþoute assoyne, To þe grete Babyloyne. Antiochus had þe forme warde And Tholomeus þe rere warde, And Alisaunder, þe riche sire, Passeþ Perce and ek Assire To Babiloyne, for men tolde Darries tresore was þere-in holde. [Menbrot] first, a geaunt fel, Made Babiloyne and ek Babel, Ac he ne mi?th, for God almi?th, Fullich it vp ydi?th, For þere fel first, for his outrage, Tuo and sexty diuers langage. Siþen a lefdy, Amiramys, Aleide his boost and al his prys, And wan þe cite wiþ al þe honoure, And fiftene kyng-riches, tut entoure. Þe cite is, as siggeþ men, Bitwene Tygres and Eufraten. An hundreþ paas is hei? þe wal, And an hundreþ gates alle of metal. Alisaundre of his regioun Þou?th þere make þe maister toun. Jn to al þe werlde he sent message, And dooþ arere newe tallage, On kynges, dukes, princes, and erles, On barouns, kni?ttes, sweynes and cherles, And dooþ gadren ost so gret Swiche was neuer non sen ?ett; For he þou?th to Affryk wende, After in þe somer hende. Ac hym was ysent a sonde Of a justise of his londe; Antipater was his name— Many man he had don shame. Þe londe-folk baden þe kyng Of hym make remiweyng. Þe kyng hym dude quyk dispose, Wiþ harme to his owen nose, For Antipater is to court ysent. Now hereþ þe kynges encoumbrement. Jn þis werlde falleþ many cas, Gydy blisse, short solas! Ypomodon, and Pallidamas, And Absolon, þat so fair was, Hij lyueden here a litel raas, Ac sone for?eten vchon was. Þe leuedyes shene als þe glas, And þise maidens, wiþ rody faas, Passen sone als floure in gras; So strong, so fair, neuere non nas Þat he ne shal passe wiþ ‘allas!’ Auenture haþ terned his paas, A?eins þe kyng and rered maas. Þat vnderstondeþ Olympias, And sendeþ to Alisaunder warnyng As to her owen swete derlyng, Þat he hym warie on al wise From Antipater his justise, And Antipater vnderstondeþ wel Þe kyng is fel and cruel. Adrad he is, he is wood nei?, A[c] ?i[f] he is of herte slei?, Hou so it euere be, Þe kyng shal abygge ar he. Venym he tempreþ wiþ wyne; Þe wyne hi?th Eleboryne— Jn þis werlde, abouen erþe, Nys wyne of so mychel werþe. To þe kyng he haþ it ysent. Þe kyng askeþ drynk of [þat] present— Men brou?tten it hym in coppe of golde. Þe kyng drank er þan he sholde. Away he sette þat golde red: ‘Allas!’ he seide, ‘Ich am nei? ded! Drynk ne shal neuere efte more Do to þis werlde so mychel sore As þis drynk ha[þ y]do. Allas! Allas! what me is [w]o For my moder Olympias, And for my suster, þat so fair was, And for myne barouns, al þing aboue, Þat Ich mi?th in herte loue! Hij ben lordeles—Ich am ded, Þorou? a traitour fals and qued. What helpeþ it lenger yteld? His poyson present me haþ aqueld. Noman þat wil þis day passe Ne drynk þerof, more ne lasse!’ Wiþ þat word he gan to swowe. Abouten hym comen barouns ynowe, And token hym quyk in her arme, And bywaileden sore his harme. Þere men mi?tten reuþe ysen— Many baroun his her to-teen, Many fyst to-wrunge and hand, Many riche robe to-rent, Michel spray, mychel gradyng, Michel weep, mychel waylyng, Often bymened his prowesse, His ?ingþe, and his hardynesse, His gentrise, and his curteisie. Alle hij gonnen aloude crye— Vpe Alisaunder name was Ycried many loude ‘allas!’ Riche and pouer, lesse and more, Wrongen hondes and wepen sore. Two mylen abouten men mi?tten here Of gentyl-men þat reuli bere. Þe kyng acom in þis gradyng, To hem alle [?af] confortyng, And seide: ‘Bringeþ me on bed myne, And, ar Ich in þis werlde fyne, Jch wil queþe myne quede To hem þat han ben me myde.’ He was ybrou?th in bed onon; Þe barouns stoden aboute vchon. ‘Lordynges’ he seide ‘of þis cuntreye, Of Tire, of Mede, of Sydoneye, Þat habbeþ wide yserued me And for me in woo ybe, Rentes, londes, als J founde A?ein Ich hem ?ou ?elde hool and sounde, And vche a þousande pounde and more, ?oure harmes forto astore. Oo, bele amye, sir Perdicas! For my loue wel many cas Þou hast yþoled and many strijf, And trewe ben in al þi lijf. J þee biqueþe Grece, myne heritage, Corinthe, Macedoyne, and Cartage, Tebes and alle þe oþer londes. Kepe my moder and wreke myne shondes. Tholomeu, my maresshale, Þou shalt haue Portyngale, And Egipte, to flum Jordon, For better baroun ne lyueþ non. Antioche, ostage by dome, Þou shalt haue riche Rome, And al Romeyn and Lumbardye, For þou þem canst als baroun gye. Aymes of Archade, so God me assoile, Þou shalt haue Calabre and Poyle, And þe riche londe of Labur, And ben Antioches nei?bur. Thiberie, wiþ flessh hardye, Þou shalt haue þe londe of Sullye, Acres, Japhes, and Jerusalem, And Nazareth and Bedlem, And al þe londe of Galilee Quytelich byqueþe J þee. Mark of Rome, bele amy! Esclauoyne, þat is so fry, Þou shalt haue, and Constantynnoble, And Lymochyus, þat londe so noble, And Gryfaine, þat riche pece, Þat lijþ to þe cee of Grece. Philoth, þou shalt haue Caucasus, And al þe londe to Malleus, And al þe londe from Caspyas, To þe riche cite of Baudas, And alle þe ydles of Taproban, Þat Ich of Porus þe kyng wan. Sampson of Ennise, for myne amour, Þou hast yþoled many dolour! Þou shalt haue al Albyenne, And Armenye, in to þe fenne, And Occanie and Newe Alisaunder, My newe cite of riche sclaunder. Salome, siþen Darrie was ded, Þou hast me serued in many red! Jn vche seruyse wel redy, Trewe in bataylle and hardy. Þou shalt haue Perce and Mede, And Babiloyne, þis riche þede. Darries blood for þou art next, Wi?th and gentyl and ek hext, Darries heir J make þee, And seise þee wiþ al his fee. Þis venym crepeþ vnder my ribbe; Ne may Ich nou?th longe lybbe.’ Jn al þis ilche grete doloure, He dude fecche al his tresoure, And ?af it kni?th, sweyn, and knaue, Als myche as hij wolden craue. Of hors, of cloþes, of siluer wone, He made hem riche euerychone, And ri?th als he had ydo, Þe lijf he lete of body goo. Ac noman, in sooþ treuþe, Ne sei? neuere so mychel reuþe Of weep, of cry, of honde wryngyng, So was for Alisaunder þe kyng. Now is þe kyng out of lijf— Quyk ariseþ wel grete strijf For þe bodyes beri?ing. After þe sorou? and þe crieyng, Salome seide, wiþ al þe fare, He wolde his body beri?e þare. Ac haue hym wolde þe duk Sampsoun To Alisaunder his newe toun. Philoth, also J fynde, Hym chalanged in to Ynde. Perdicas, wiþoute assoigne, Hym chalenged to Macedoyne. Aymes, wiþ grete vigoure, Askeþ hym to þe londe of Laboure. Antioche, by hei?e dome, Wolde hym lede to riche Rome. Vche baroun sett on honde, And wolde hym lede to his londe. Jn al þis strijf þat was hem myd, Ouere hem sat a gentyl bryd, And seide: ‘Barouns, leteþ ?oure strijf, And dooþ Goddes hest, blyf! Of his beri?ing noþing ne dredeþ, Ac in to Egipte þe corps ledeþ, Jn to Alisaunder þe cite apert Þat he made in desert, Þoo he destroyed þe vermyne. Quyk, J sigge, dooþ hest myne!’ Quyk þe foule went out of si?th. Þe barouns duden als it hi?th— Þat body richely hij kepte, And ledden it in to Egipte, And leiden hym in gold fyne, Jn a temple of Apolyne. Nisten men neuere heþen kyng Haue so riche a beri?ing. Tholomeu haþ þe seisine. God us lene wel to fyne! Þoo þe kyng was ydelue, Vche duk went to hym-selue, And maden woo and cuntek ynou?. Vche of hem nei? oþer slou?, For to haue þe kynges quyde. Michel bataille was hem myde. Þus it fareþ in þe myddelerde, Amonge þe lew[ed] and þe lerde! Whan þe heued is yfalle, Acumbred ben þe membres alle. Þus ended Alisaunder þe kyng. God vs graunte his blissyng! Amen.</field>
