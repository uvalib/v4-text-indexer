      <field name="fulltext">HIS MOST ASSVRED and tryed frende, master Christofer Hatton Esquyer, Thomas Churchyarde wysheth continuaunce of vertue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The firste booke.] The pagination of the source document has been followed. Ouid to his booke The first Elegia. My litle booke (I blame the not) to statelye towne shall go. O cruell chaunce, that where thou go, thy maister may not so. Go now thy way: yet sute thy selfe, in sad and simple geare, Such exiles weede as tyme requyre, I will that thou do weare. No vastie Uiolet shall thou vse, nor robe of Purple hue, Those costlye coulours be vnfit, our carefull cause to rue. Wyth ruddie redde dye not thy face, nor sappe of Cedar tree, Such outward hue see that thou haue, as cause assines to thee. Frounce not thy feareful face I saye, nor haplesse head do stroke, But roughe and rugde so shewe in sight, that pittye may prouoke, Those subtill sleights be much more meete, for volumes voyde of payne, But thou of my vnfrendlye fate a myrror must remayne. Be not a basht thy ruthfull blots, to set and shewe in sight, That of my teares men may them iudge, to haue beene made a right. Depart thy waye and in my name, salute those blessed bowers, When as thy fearefull foote shall fall, in CÃ¦sars statelye towers. If anye be (as some there are) amongst the rurall route, Forgetlesse frends shall aske for mee, or oughte shall seeme to doute. Saye that I liue: which as I do, by force of heauenlye might, So do confesse my troubled state, wherein thou sees me plight. If further speach shall thee prouoke, or other skill they craue, I charge thee then to take good heede: no wastful wordes to haue. My faultye facts if anye shall, reproue perhappes to thee, Or doolefull deedes in publike place condempned chaunce to bee. Spend thou no speach, nor do not care, tho threatning browes they bende, A rightful cause it hindreth oft, with wordes if we defende. Some shall thou finde that will bewayle, me thus in exile sent, And reading thee wyth tricklinge teares, my carefull case lament. And in their muttringe mindes will wishe (lest wicked men may heare) That CÃ¦sars yre once set asyde, from paynes I may be cleare. To such therefore as well do wishe, to vs that payne do proue, To mightye Ioue wee pray likewyse, like sorrowes to remoue. All thinges thus stalde in quiet state, and CÃ¦sars grace once wonne, Doth wishe my lothsome life to ende, where life I first begonne. A worke vnworthye of my witte, of thee some men will iudge, And doing that I thee requyre, at thee likewyse shall grudge. Yet ought a Iudge as well to time, as matter haue regarde, Which if he haue (as I do hope) thou safely shalbe harde. For pleasaunt verses do proceede, from quiet resting brayne, But soden sorrowes mee assaultes, with hugye heapes of payne. A time of trouble voyde it craues, a perfit verse to make, But mee: the Seas, the wrestlinge windes, the winter wild doth shake. A minde more free from feare it askes, in deadly doubt I stande, Lest that my life wyth sword be rest, by force of ennemyes hande. Yet some there are that marueile will, and rightfull iudges bee, When they this meane and simple verse, with equall eyes shall see. For though that Homer yet did liue, wyth sorrowes so be set, His wonted wits through malyce mighte, I feare he should forget. Yet shewe thy selfe (my selye booke) without regarde of fame, Nor though per case thou dost desplease, let it not thee ashame. Syth fortune so vnfrendlye is, to hope it were in vayne, That thou hereby should purchase prayse, to make thereof thy gayne. Whyle fortune smylde wyth smyrken cheere, of fame I had desyre, And noted name on euerye syde, I sought for to acquyre. A fayned verse lo now I make, and hate my hurtfull lore, Let it suffice: sith that my wit, forsaketh me therefore. Yet go thou on, and in my steede, the royall Rome to see, God graunt that there as none of myne, they may accompt of thee, And though thou there a stranger be, thincke not vnknowen to come, But that amids the mightye towne, thou shalbe knowen to some. Thy couller wil disclose thy craft, although thou were no name, By deepe deseight or otherwyse, by skill to cloke the same. In priuy wyse yet passe thou in, my verse may els offende, The wonted grace it clearely wantes, which I to verse did lende. To reade as myne if any shal, vnworthy therefore deeme, And from his hands to cast away, to thee by happe shall seeme. Tell then thy name: thou arte not hee, of loue that taught the lore, That wicked worke hath felt the paynes, that it deserude. before. Perhappes thou loke I should the bid, the Pallace proude to clyme, Where CÃ¦sar royal Court doth keepe, wyth pleasant passed tyme. Those Princely places and eke Gods, of pardon too I craue, Syth from the statelye tops of them, this lightening lo we haue. The time I may remember when, those Gods more gentle were, Such therefore as hurtfull be, by profe of payne I feare. The seely doue that once was nymde, wyth Gossehaukes greedy nipe, Doth dread the smallest glympes of her, to flye her greuous gripe. The wandring lambe that worowing wolfe, had caught by courage bould, Escapinge then his cruell chaps, doth sleepe in shepeheards foulde. Ye Phaeton would shonne the skyes, if he againe did raine, And hate the horses whom she loude, for feare of former paine. My selfe confesse that haue receiude, of Ioue his launce a wound, Do feare the force of flaching fyre, by thonders threatning sounde. Who so Capharia seekes to shon, in way from Gretian fleete, That he alwayes from Eboike Seas, to turne his sterne is meete. My shippe that lately did escape, wyth sturdye storme a clappe, In that same place doth hate to come, for feare of like mishappe. My booke therefore beware and stande, wyth feareful minde in doubt, And be content that thou be redde, in priuate place about. While Icarus wyth tender winges did clyme the starrye skye, In surging Seas he fell adowne, which haue their name thereby. The Oweier or the sayles to vse, herein to know is hard, But time and cause shall counsaile thee, if thou thereto regard. An idle time if thou espye, when ceased is debate, And when all ire is pacifyed, and turnde to frendlye state. Some doubting thus wyth fearefull face, wil thee perhappes present, So he wyth words thy way haue made, then go where thou art sent. More happye happe God graunt thou haue, and far more luckye day, Then I haue had: when thou come there, our sorrowes to allay. For he alone can salue my sore, of whom the wounde I haue, And hurt and heale by selfe same skill, Achilles latelye gaue. Take heede while helpe herein thou seeke, thereby no hurt aryse, For feare doth farre surmount our hope, thy selfe therefore aduise. In mindes to quiet bent, renewe not wrath againe, Lest thou vnwares may kindle coles, to double former payne. Yet when vnto my homely house, thou shalt returne to mee, And in thy croked shryne be set, a place made meete for thee. Thy brethren there thou shalt behould, in order seemelye set, One onelye father all they had, whom he by skill beget. The rest that there in sight do shewe, by synes thou may descerne, Whose names be set amids their browes, that thou thereof may learne. And three also in priuye place, do lurcke in darckesome den, Of loue the craftye skil they teache, as it is knowen to men. Those wicked wights thou shal eschew, or if thou may, proclame, For such as fathers lately slewe, by Telogonian name. These three I warne the of, if thou (the father not disdaine, Of loue although the waye they teache, to loue yet thou refraine. And fifetene volumes more in verse, of chaunged bodyes bee, Which at my funeralles I had, and there bereft from mee. Amonge the which transformed shapes, saye thou that I do craue, That my misfortune may be set, with them a place to haue. Unlikely to her former hests, her altringe wondrous straunge, For now she weepes that whilom smylde, as chaunce of time doth chaunge. More matter yet (if thou had askte) I had to tel beside, But that I feare it might be cause, to long that thou abide. For if nothinge that comes to minde, from thee I should detaine, A burden farre more huge thou were, then bearers coulde sustaine. Longe is thy waye therefore make hast, for we shall nowe abyde, In furthest coast of all the earth, farre from our countrye wyde. To the Gods. The seconde Elegia. O Gods of Seas and skye, for what saue (prayers may preuaile) Do not destroye our shaken shippes, in surginge Seas to saile. Nor do you not to CÃ¦sars wrath, with hole assent resort, For him whom one God doth oppresse, an other may support. Thoughe Vulcane stoode aduerse to Troye, Apollo sought reliefe, And Venus was to Troyans iust, though Pallas wrought their griefe. So Iuno did Eneas hate, who Turnus helde full deare, Yet he through helpe of Venus power, from harme was saued cleare. The fearce Neptunus oft did seeke, to short Vlixes dayes, Yet from her Eme Mynerua did, his life preserue alwayes. And though we farre inferiour be, in heauenlye force and might, A frendlye God yet who forbids, an angrye God to spight. But wastfull wordes (O wretche) I spende, no good thereby aryse, Saue that it makes the watrye waues, to springe from speakers eyes. My painfull speache and prayers prest, the Southren winde hath rent, And suffers not that they do come, to Gods where they be sent. With one alonelye cause therefore lest I be hurt, should deeme Both shippes and vowes I knowe not where, to beare awaye they seeme. What boysterous billowes now (O wretche) amids the waues we spye, As I forthwith should haue beene heude, to toutch the Assour skye. What vacant vallies be there set, in swallowinge Seas so wrought, As presentlye thou lokes I should, to drerye hell be brought. I lokte about: saue Seas and skye, nought subiect was to sight, With swellinge surges one, with cloudes, the other threatned spight. Betweene them both with whisling sounde, the whyrling windes do rende, And fominge seas to whether God, do stand in doubt to bende. Now doth sir Eurus winds take force, at ryse of morning bright, Nowe Zepherus is prest at hande, to waight the darckesome night. Nowe Borias with perching drye, from Northren Poole do glide, Now Notus lo wyth fearce afflickt, doth put his force aside. The gyde himselfe in doubtfull muse, what he may flye do craue, Astonyed stayes his wonted skil, from wracke the shippe to saue. We dye therefore: no hope at al of life there doth remaine, While thus I speake the bitter teares, my feareful face distaine. The flouds my minde opprest while thus, in vaine we prayd alas, And by our careful mouth adowne, the deadly droppes do pas. My godlye wyfe it onlye greeues, in exile I am sent, This one mishap alone she knowes, for this she doth lament. In largest seas how I am cast, to her no feare do seeme, Nor tost wyth windes she knoweth not, nor death so neare do deeme. O happye yet I did her leaue, and so my selfe auise, For els (O wretche) my payne were more, then death haue suffred twise. But though that I do perishe quite, sith she in life remayne, I thincke thereby my dayes to length, and halfe a life to gayne. What flames (alas) with swift recourse, from skowling clouds do light? What cruell crashing noyse do sounde, from axe in hauen on hight? No lighter blowes our shippe do beare, by surges waightye gushe, Then loftye walles when they susteine, the Cannons cruel rushe. This raging floud which hence do come, in force all flouds surmount, Behinde the nint before the leuent, in sight we may accompt. Nor death I feare though this do seeme, a wretched death to bee, Set wracke asyde, a gift it is, a welcome gest to mee. Somewhat it is for such as are, by sword or fate decayde, That dying so in mouldy earth, their liuelesse corps be layde. Their faithful frends they may exhort, and gladsome graue obtaine, And not in seas to haue beene stroyed, and fishes foode be slaine. Admit I do deserue such death? alone I am not heare? Why should my griefe procure these paines, whose facts fr? faults be clere? O Saintes aboue and Gods so great, which rule the waters all, Of eyther sort more meeker bee, &amp; threatning browes let fall. So life which CÃ¦sars gentle wrath, hath lent, to passe aliue, Herewith I may (if you let not) at pointed place ariue. If any payne I haue deserude, haue you my death decreed? My fault at all no death deserues, the iudge himselfe agreed. If CÃ¦sar would haue sent mee downe, to swimme in Stigian lake, No helpe of you for that he needes, nor paynes therein should take. No such enuye he doth pretende, nor longeth so for bloud, Syth that he gaue, and may receiue, when he so thincks it good. And you therefore we humblye pray, sith ye no harme sustayne, Indifferent mindes herein to haue, and not encrease our payne. For though you would wyth whole assent, my wretched body saue, Thincke you by that for dampned soule, a helpe hereafter haue? Though seas were calme, though winds were still, &amp; you O Gods c?tent, Yet as exild I should remayne, by CÃ¦sars owne assent. I do not seeke for greedy gaine, by marchants craftye skill, Whereby I should occasion haue, the surging seas to till. Nor Athens lo I loke to see, where I haue sought for lore, Nor Asia mighty townes to vewe, not seene to mee before. Nor yet to Alexandria cost, I would conueyed bee, That there I might (O Nilus) rest, thy pleasures there to see. The winds I wishe (who would beleue) my shippe in hast to driue. Unto Sarmatia famous land, that there it might ariue. As I am bound euen so I would, to Pontus hauen attayne, And leauing thus my countrye deare, my slowe successe I playne. Nor know not in what coast to find, the towne that Tomos hight, And by my painefull prayers so, I take my feareful flight. If me you loue: then do I craue, your swellinge flouds to tame, And by your heauenlye power permit, our shippes may saile the same. Or if you hate: compell me then, to pointed place to flye, A part of paine I thincke it is, in straungers ground to dye. Now hale away you boisterous winds, why do we here abyde? And by Italia shore in sight, what causeth vs to ryde? Syth CÃ¦sar hath decreed my flight, will you thereto denye? Wherefore permit my eyes maye come, where Pontia they may spye. Thus hath he iudgde, thus I deserue, nor what he doth reproue, By right or law to fend my fault, it may not me behoue. If doleful deedes of mortal men, to Gods be not vnknowne, Than may you see not my offence, of wicked minde is growne. But if such skill they haue, and I, by error so distraught, My minde wyth ignoraunce and not, with wickednes was fraught. If any loue to CÃ¦sars house, we simple men do beare, His publike hestes it shall suffice, that we do dread and feare. If I haue told of happye dayes, wherein that he did raigne, To CÃ¦sar and CÃ¦sarians all, haue done my busye payne. If I such faythful minde haue had, so graunt (O Gods) reliefe, If not: to drounde in Seas I wyshe, and ende my wearye griefe. But am I now deceyued? or do the skowling clouds waxe fayre, Or do the billowes breake in sight? or calme to seas repayre. No chaunce but cause haue cald you here, your ayde we pray to lend, Syth you no fraude or craft may blind, for helpe we do attend. Hee departeth from Rome, remembreth the teares of his wyfe and frendes. Eleg. 3. VVhen I the pensiue picture see, of darcke and drery night, And in my minde behold the Towne, from wh?ce I toke my flight. Or time record, when I did leaue, my frendes and dere alyes, Then do the dolefull droppes discende, from my sad weeping eyes. The day drue on I should depart, as CÃ¦sar wild before, And flee a farre to partes extreame, and shonne Italia shore. No time or perfit space I had, nor minde for prayer prest, And drowsines by long delay, had crept in carefull brest. No men there were to waight on mee, no care I had to reede, No garmentes meete for myne estate, nor wealth to serue my neede. I was astoynde: as he that feels the force of lightning flame, Who thincks he were of life bereft, and yet enioyes the same. But when this cloude of minde was gone, by sorrowe set asyde, And that my sences did returne, in former health to byde. At last my sorye frendes I spake, when I away did pas, Which of a nomber that I had, but one or two there was. My louing wyfe all weeping thus me weeping did sustaine, Till that by her vnworthy cheekes, a shoure of teares did raine. My doughter deare was farre away, in coast of Libia land, And of my fate no word she knew, nor cause could vnderstand. A yelling and a cryinge noyse did sound on euery syde, No secrete forme of funerall, wythin my house did byde. The man the wyfe, the blamelesse babe, my dolefull death do rue, In euery corner of my house, a streame of teares there grue. If we doubt not our matters small, by greater thinges make plaine, As Troy when it was tane, so we, in like estate remaine. Now whisted was the voyce of men, of dogges and euery wight, And Cynthea ledde the horses then, that ruld the darckesome night. I loking vp, did cast mine eyes, the Senate house to see, Which next our careful cot in vaine, was built in good degree. And sayd (O Gods) that here do rest, and nearest neighbours bee, O stately Temples whom mine eyes, henceforth shal neuer see. And you O heauenlye goasts I leaue, in loftye Rome to dwell, For euer here I take my leaue, and bid you al farewell. But (though that after greuous wounds) my shield to late I haue, Yet do vouchsafe my feareful flight, from hurtfull hate to saue. And saye vnto this heauenly man: by error I did fall, Lest wickednes may els be thought, to haue beene mixt with all. And that which you do al perceiue, let him perceyue the same, (That Gods once pleasd) I may be sure, to haue no wretches name. These paineful prayers haue I made, the mighty Gods vnto, My wyfe with more: while sobbing sithes her words haue letted so. Before the doores with heares be spred, she prostrate so did lye, And with her mouth the Alters kist, that builded are thereby. Full manye helpelesse words she spake, to aduers houses than, Which nought at all for me preuailde, that was condempned man. The hasting night now drew away, nor longer space would graunt, Wherewyth the starres did turne one axe, the darckesume night to daunt. What might I do? as loth I was, to leaue my countrye deare, So was the pointed night now come, and almost passed cleare. How oft cryed I to such as then, my long delay contrould, Why force you mee? why hast you so? whence go we now, behold. How often haue I faind likewise, a certaine houre to haue, Which for my iorney were more fit, and mee from daunger saue. The threshold thrise I kist, and thrise I was cald backe I trow, My minde was dull and made no hast, my feete in flight were slow. Oft times I sayd farewel, and yet, for which I speake and plaine, And then as parting I returnde, to kisse my frendes againe. Oft times the same preceptes I gaue, and being yet begilde, I looked backe and cast mine eyes, to see my selye childe. In fine: what hast? to Sithia nowe, it is that we are sent, And Rome we leaue yet both delayes, be done of iust intent. My wyfe although she liue I loose, I yet do liue likewise, Wyth house and members sweete thereof, which I cannot dispise. My faythfull fellowes eke whom I, as brethren did esteeme, Whose fastned fayth as true to mee (O Thesyan mates I deeme. Them there in armes I did embrace, which neuer more I might, Eche houre a gratefull gaine I thought, that geeuen mee was that night. No more delay I made, but left my talke imperfit there, All things that I should then haue sayd, in minde recorded nere. While we our sorrye speach did spend, and while we weeped thus, The day starre gan appeare on skye, a heuye starre to vs. Wherewyth a pange I felt as though, my members haue forlorne, And from my body euery part, did seeme to haue bene torne. I playnd as Priam whilom did, when he the treason knewe, And saw his foes from horse to slippe, when Troyan mates they slew. A common crye did then aryse, my frendes a roring make, Their careful brestes of clothing bare, with heauy hands they strake. Departing then: to shoulders fast, my wyfe did cleaue afraid, And wyth my teares her wordes she mixt, and thus euen then she said. Thou shal not go: together vs, to flee they shal constrayne, I follow thee of exiles wyfe, and exile wil remayne. The waye is made for mee, and I, the furthest lande wil see, And to your passing shippes I shal, a slender burden bee. CÃ¦sars wrath commaundeth you our countrye deare to flee, But loue, this godlye loue, shal CÃ¦sar geeue to mee. Like helpelesse thinges she did assaye, as oft she did before, And skant her weary hands she gaue, her profit to restore. I comming forth as one that were, depriude of rightfull graue, A nastye skinne, a hanging beare, a foming mouth I haue. Some say that she wyth sorrowes great, at end of darckesome night, Amids the house in frantike moode, did cast her selfe in sight. And that at length she roose againe, her heares in dust arayde, And members colde from ground she heud, as one right sore afrayde. Sometimes her selfe, sometimes her house, shee doth bewayle wyth all, And to her husband absent then, full oft by name she call. No lesse she weeped there then if, her woful eyes should spye, My doughter or my selfe made meete, on burning coles to lye. Such care she had her death to haue, and leaue her liuing sence, Yet none it were respecting mine, though she so passed hence. But now God graunt that she do liue, sith fates do so decree, That by her helping hand I may, the more releeued bee. Bootes now which keepes the bere, of Eremanthus woode, In Ocean sea is diued lowe, whose star doth stir the flood. Yet sayle we not in Iouian seas, for that we so do craue, But are compeld by present feare, more boldnes there to haue. Lo nowe (O wretche) the seas waxe black, the boisterous windes do beate, And sandes that from the depth be drawne, do burne with sowly heate. Our shippes with waues no lesse then hilles, is tossed to and fro, Our painted Gods with billowes bet, their quiet state forgo. The slender sides do crye and sounde, with stresse the cables crake, The ship it selfe with our ill happe, a fearefull groning make. The maister by his pale aspecte, bewrayes his secrete fere, And ouercomde pursues the shippe, by skil rules not the stere. Like as the fearefull ryder doth, let slip the horses reane, Who yeldeth to his carelesse will, and art forgetteth cleane. Euen so not where he would, but where the forcing water driue, The sayle I see he lettes at large, in washing waues to diue. That if sir Eolus had not sente his chaunged windes abrode, I surely had or this beene blowen, to place that was forbode. For far from Leria coast lo then, on left syde fast at hand, The interdicted place we saw, and spide Italia land. But let the foming seas (we pray) forbidded those to seeke. That they wyth me the Gods obey, and shew themselues more meeke, While speaking thus we prayde and feard, to haue beene driue abacke, With wondrous force of sturdy waue, our shippe sides lo did cracke. O mightye Gods of barble seas, let not your ire aryse, That Ioue himselfe wyth me be wrath, we craue it may suffyce. And do you not my very mind, with cruell death constrayne, If he that death haue suffred once, cannot depart agayne. To his constant frende. Eleg. 4. O Frend whom first among my mates, as chiefe in minde I deeme, O thou that dost my heauy fate, euen as thyne owne esteeme. That first releaued me I meane, amazed where I laye, And bouldest were wyth willing mouth, comforting woords to saye. Which gently gaue me counsell then, to liue and length my dayes, When loue of death in careful brest, had crept by sondry wayes. Thou knowes to whom I speake although, the name in synes I set, Thy dutye and thy frendlye care, no whit I do forget. In deepest depth of minde, these thinges, I printed haue full plaine, A detter still of thine I shal, for euer more remaine. With wandring winds this sprite of mine, shal passe away and flee, And lasting boones with flaminge fire, shal quite consumed bee. Before that these thy good deserts, shal skape my carefull minde, Or els this godly loue wyth time, from thence away shall finde. Let mighty Gods now fauour thee, that helpe thou nede none craue, And fortune farre vnlike to myne, God graunt that thou may haue. Yet if the shippe had sauelye saild, and frendly winds had blowne, This loue and faythfull frendship then, perhappes had not beene knowne. Peritheus did not accompt, Duke Thesius for his frend, Till that for him to Stigian lake, aliue he did discend. Orestes so thy furyes fearre, ful perfit trials bee, With how true hart that Pylades, was linckt in loue to thee. If that the stout Euryalus, with Butils had not fought, Thy noble fame (O Nysus) then, had not ben blowne abought. Like as the fine and perfit gould, in flaming fyre is tryde, Euen so the loue of frendship is, in troublous time discryde. Whyle fortune lust to smyle and geue, her helping hand withall, And things to grounded wealth they haue, that may thereto befall. But when her thretning browes she bend, they shrincke awaye and flee, Where hugye heapes but latelye were, not one now left we see. This skilful rede I learnde by ils, in other that did grow, But now euen of myne owne mishaps, by proofe the same I know. Scant two or three my frendes you are, that of my rought remayne, The rest as fortunes and not mine, I do accompt them playne. You fewe therefore do helpe our payne, that rest we may achiue, And that by you our shaken shippes, in safer shoore ariue. With fayned feare be not afrayde, a thing both fonde and vayne, Lest God mysliking that your loue, offended do remayne. For CÃ¦sar oft in ennemyes doth, his faythfull frendshippe prayse, And that which in his owne, in foes, he doth approue alwayse. My cause yet better is, I haue, no aduers armour worne, My follye is the cause that I, my contrey haue forlorne. With waking mindes our heauy haps, do you bewayle, and praye That CÃ¦sars raging wrath the more, thereby may haue delaye. Who so my cares doth seeke to know, in nomber them to haue, A thing more hard then may be done, he seemes thereby to craue. So many ils lo haue I borne, as starres in Asyoure skye, And litle graynes of flying dust, on parched ground do lye. And many more of greater waight, we forced were to bere. Which though they chanst, of credit yet, in them some doubt there were. Some part whereof as doth behoue, with mee must dye awaye, And by my meane would God were none, that might the same bewraye. A persing speache although I had, a firme and flinty brest, And greater store of mouthes thereto, where in more tongues did rest. Yet al in words I do not know, how I might comprehend, The thing exceeding further then, my wittes may well extend. My troubles great (O Poets learnd) for Duke Vlisses wright, Yet I more ils then he hath borne, for truth you may endight. In compasse smal he many yeares, was tossed vp and downe, Betweene the Gretians noble lande, and Troyans famous towne. But we the wydest seas haue met, and wandred euery wayes, To Geta crickes haue bene driuen, and eke Sermatia bayes. A faythful hand Vlisses had, wyth mates both true and iust, But me my fellowes fled in whom, I chiefely put my trust. In merye moode as victor then, he went his land to see, But I as victored do depart, and exile hence to flee. In Greece ne yet Ithacia ground, nor Samia do I dwell, From whence to be no payne it is, but may be suffered well. But Rome which from the mountaynes seuen, we there behold in sight, Thempyre large and Gods therof, lo thence I take my flight. A body strong Vlisses had, that labor could sustayne, A smal and slender corps I haue, wyth weeke and tender brayne. To cruell warres and marshall deedes, hath he beene vsde alwayes, In quiet studye haue I dwelt, and liued al my dayes. The greatest God oppresseth mee, to whom no God resort, But Pallas him assisted still, and did his cause support. Neptunus ire the God of Seas, haue greued him right sore, But me Almighty Ioue oppresse, whose wrath reuengeth more. The greatest part of his now be, for fables counted playne, Of our mishappes no part at all, for lesing do remayne. In fine, euen as he did desire, at pointed place aryue, Which long he wist: right so he did, at length attaine aliue. But I my country deare do thincke, now neuer more to see, Unlesse the ire of angrye Gods, appeased happe to bee. To his wyfe. Elegia. 5. Calimachus did not so burne, wyth loue to Lyda lent, Nor yet so sore Phylates had, his hart on Battis bent. As the (O mate most true) my brest, wythin I deepely graue, Which worthy art a better not, but happier husband haue. I falling fast by the do hould, as by abootfull beame, Thy gift it is, that I haue scapt, a part of troubles streame. Thou art the cause, I am no may, to such as seeke to see, The letters brought that might declare, the wofull wracke of mee, Like as the wolfe that bloud desyres, when hunger hard do pricke, Of seely sheepe that be vnkept, the flesh ful fayne would licke. Or as the greedy Gripe vpon, the careful corps doth stare, When on the grounde he sees it lye, and left vnburned bare. So one there was I know not who, my hard hap did mistrust, Uppon my goodes if thou lets not, his hands had layde vniust. But him thy vertue did wythstand, by force of frends ful true, To whom no thancke we render may, as to their deedes is due. In carefull case a witnes true, thy deedes therefore doth prayse, If witnes do perchaunce preuayle, in these our dolefull dayes. In vertuous life Andromacha, thy name doth not distaine, Nor Laodamia who did leaue, her life wyth husbande slaine. If Homer thou had hapt vppon, thy fame should farre exceede, Aboue the chast Penelopeis, of whom in him we reade. But if these maners meeke the Gods, did geeue thee all vntaught, And in the daye of blissefull byrth, of nature thou them caught. Or els the matrone most to prayse, on whom thou waightest longe, A myrror did thee make to be, all honest wyues amonge. And to her selfe with custome longe, hath causde thee like to seeme, By greater thinges of matters small, we doubt not for to deeme. Full woo I am my verse hath not, more force in such a case, And that my tongue doth not suffice, thy faythfull factes to blase. For loke what liuelye strents of minde, afore in mee there spronge, Is quenched quite and fallen away, wyth sorrowes sore and longe. The cheefe amonge the Ladyes of, great fame thou mightest sit, And of all men be lokt vppon, for vertue and for wit. And so what power my penne maye haue, when verse I do indyte, From time to time thou shalt aye liue, in verse that I can wryte. To his frendes that ware his Image ingraude. Elegia. 6. VVhat frende thou be that Image haue, in forme made like to mee, No Garlands gaye wyth Iuye wrought, about his head let be. These happye synes most comlye be, that pleasaunt Poets were, My troublous time is farre vnfitte, the Lawrell crowne to beare. And thou that beares about of mee, in ringe the picture prest, Fayne y? these thinges were neuer spoke, althoughe thou knowes them best. The countenance deare of mee, that am, in exile sent beholde, The likenes of my louring lookes, which thou hast graude in goulde. Whereon when thou shalt cast thine eyes, then haplye thou may say, Howe farre from vs is Naso now, our fellowe sent away. Thy loue I well alowe but yet, my verses print more plaine My forme: which as they be, I bid, to reade do not disdayne. My verse I saye that doth declare, howe men straung shapes did shade, Unhappye worke whose maister fled, and left vnperfit made. The same wyth heauy hande full sadde, in flaming fyre I thrust, With much more of my greuous goods, when needes depart I must And as they say that Thestias, did burne with fatall fire, Her sonne: and sister kinder was, then mother moude wyth ire: So I my bookes my bowels deare, which no desert did show, To dye away with mee did then, in flashing flames bestowe. Which eyther was because my muse, as hurtfull I did hate, Or els for that my verse was rude, and not in perfit state. Which as they be not quite extinct, but partlye yet appere, In volumes mo then one I thincke, that then they written were. So now I wishe them still remayne, none idle slouth that bee, The reader to delight but may, remember him of mee. But yet no man with pacient cares, to read them can abide, Except he know that vncorrect, from me the same did slide. That worke was pluckt away when halfe, he had his labour skant, The trimming tricke that last should come, my wrytinges clearely want. For painted prayse thy pardon craue, thy prayse shall wel suffice, If thou that chaunce to reade this booke, my worke do not despise. And here also sixe verses haue, which if thou thincke it best, In formest front of that my booke, see that thou let them rest. What man thou be these volumes touch, of father now bereft, At lest wyse graunt within your house, a place for them be left. And that thou should more fauor them, of him they were not sent, In publike prease: but as it were, the maisters herse of rent. If that vnlearned verse therefore, shal shew forth any cryme, The maister would haue mended it, if he had longer time. To his frende that breake his promise. Eleg. 7. The freshe flouds shal from Seas retyre, againe their springs vnto, So shal the sonne wyth horses tournd, his course reuoke also. The earth shal eke the bright starre beare, &amp; ayre the plow shal cleue, The water shal bringe forth the flames, and fyre shall water geue. All things shal now by natures lawes, in order straunge proceade, No part and of this wandring world, his way aright shall leade. All thinges shal come to passe which I, denyed afore could bee. For nothing is so straung to heare, but we may hope to see. It shall be so I gesse because, of him I am reiecte, Whose helpe I hoped now that should, my wofull cause protecte. O faythlesse frende how came so great, forgetfulnes of mee, Why were thou then so sore afrayd, my carefull corpes to see? That once againe thou might not loke, nor comfort me opprest. Nor yet (harde hart) my funerals, pursue among the rest. The sacrede name of frendshippe fayre, that all men do adore, Under thy foote thou lettest lye, as thing of litle store. And though thou did no teares let fall, for this my sorrye plight, Yet far from hart some words to say, with fayned griefe thou might. At lest wyse that which straungers did, then did we wel to fare, With peoples voyce and publike speache, agree that goodwill bare. And then that face with morning fret, no more in sight tappere, Whyle yet thou mightest to loke vpon, the last day I was there. To take and geue wyth talke alike, our farewel in such case, Which once we might and then no more, while world endures embrace. As others mo which with no league, of frendshippe I had bound, Who then declarde their griefe of minde, with trickling teares on ground. Where els should I to the be knit, wyth life in common led, With causes eke of great effect, and loue in long time bred. Why els knewe thou so many bourds, and earnest actes of myne, And I so manye matters said, and pleasaunt prancks of thyne. What if alone at royall Rome, our frendship had beene knit, But thou so oft in euerye place, was cald a fellow fit. With winsome windes of seas in vayne, haue all these taken flight? Or els all thinges in Leathe lake, are drounde wyth darcksome night. I thincke in towne thou were not borne, that Rome of Quirine hight, A towne alas wherein to come, I maye not woful wight. But in the rockes which here do lye, on left syde of the Sea, In croked cragges of Sarmatis, in lande of Sythia. That in thy hart be heaped highe, of flint the stonye vaynes, And eke of iron the seedes so hard, wythin thy brest remaynes. The nourse also which gaue the sucke, through tender mouth to pas, Wyth fruitful teates when thou wert yonge, vntamed Tyger was. For els thou would not lesse regard, the heauye happe I beare, Then straungers ill: nor giltye yet, of rygor rough appeare. But synce the same my fatall fall, and sorrowes do encrease, That frendship should in his first time, from dutye doing sease. Now cause I may forget thy fault, and then I shal againe, Wyth selfe same tongue thy kindnesse prayse, that I do now complayne. To his frende that the common people followeth fortune. Eleg. 8. All voyde of griefe God graunt thou may, last ende of life attayne, Which as a frend to reade this worke, of mine, dost not disdaine. And here I wyshe my prayers might, preuayle for thy behoue, Which for my selfe the cruell Gods, to mercye could not moue. In nomber thicke thy frendes will come, while hap hanges on thy syde, If stormye cloudes of time appeare, alone thou shalt abyde. Behold how doues to house resort, in whitlye coullors cladde, In beastly boure of sluttishe cotte, no byrd abydeth gladde. The painefull pismeere neuer comes, in barne left voyde and bare, No frend repayres where goodes before, be cleane consumde with care. When Sonne doth shyne the shadowe shewes, of them that walke abrode, When it lyeth hid in cloude he list, no longer make abode. The vnconstant sort of people so, do follow fortunes light, Which quenched once w? houering showre, they straight do take their flight. And would to God thou might perceyue, that falselye this do sound, But I must needes confesse them true, by fortune that I found. While we did stande in perfect state, our house desyrde no fame, But yet was knowen and had resort, as did suffice the same. But when it first began to shake, they feared sore the fall, And wilye backs to fleing turnd, to saue themselues withall. No maruayle though they feare the flash, of lightning cruell flame, By fyre of which all thinges is wont, consume that neare it came. But CÃ¦sar yet among his foes, that frende doth well allow, Which doth not shrinke but tarye still, when fortune bendes her brow. No wonted vse he hath to fume (no man is more modest) If he which loude to louer still, in troubleous time is prest. The fame doth tell how Thoas king, on Pylades did rew, When as by mate of Gretian lande, Orestes once he knew. Patroclus parfit fayth which was, with great Achilles knit, Was wont full oft wyth worthy prayse, in Hectors mouth to sit. They saye because that Thesius, wyth frende of his did pas, Amonge the Princes blacke of hel, their God full sorrye was. Wee may beleeue O Turnus that, thy cheekes wyth teares were wet, When thou harde of Euralius, and Nysus faythes so set. In wretches eke there is a loue, in foes which we approue, O heauye hap so fewe there be, which wyth my wordes I moue. Such is the state and chaunce of mee, and of my matters all, That nothing ought my teares to stoppe, from sorye face to fall. He reioyseth that his frende profited in learninge. Eleg. 9. Althoughe my hart for priuate chaunce, wyth sadnes so be fraught, It lighter lyes when I hereof, the knowledge thou hadst caught. I saw (most deare) that here thou should within this port ariue, Afore this way the wrastling windes, thy ship began to driue. If maners milde with vertue mixt, or life deuoyde of blame, Be had in price no man that liues, deserues a better name. Or if by art of conning knowen, that any do assend, There comes no cause which thou cannot, with pleasant words defend. With these in mind I moued thus, to the then streight can saye, A greater stage (O frende) remaynes, thy vertue to displaye. No spleene of sheepe, of lightning flame, no flashe on left side seene, No chirting song nor sleight of foule, a syne whereof hath beene. By reasons rule I did deuine, and iudge of that should come, All these in minde I gessed right, and of them knowledge nome. In hart therefore I ioyfull am, for the they proued true, Also for me, to whom thy wit, was knowen as did ensue. But would to God that myne had lyne, full low in darcknes hidde, For neede requyres my studious stile, of louely lighte to ridde. And as the science sad and graue, wyth pyked speache and fyne, Doth profit thee: so am I hurt, wyth lore vnlike to thyne. But yet my life thou knowes right well, how that far from this art, Is masters maners distant all, repungne in euery part. Thou knowest of old this verse was writ, by me when I was yonge, And that it was though not to prayse, in iest and playing songe. Like as no crafty couller can, in their defence haue might, So I suppose my verse may not, excused be wyth right. Euen as thou can do them excuse, and frends cause not forsake, And wyth such steppes as thou hast goone, thy way right forth do take. Hee prayseth his shippe he founde at Corinthia. Elegia. 10. A shippe I haue (and God so graunt) gouernde by Pallas might, Whose happye name on helme thereof, depainted is in sight. If sayles therein we neede to vse, wyth slender winde she sayles, Or if the owyer: her wan she takes, and easye force preuayles. Her fellowes all wyth speedy course, to passe is not content, But doth put backe by sondry skilles, all shippes that forward bent. The flowing flouds she lightlye bears, and fels the tossing seas, No cruell waues she yeldes vnto, but sayles away with ease. With her I came acquainted first, euen at Corinthia ground, Whom since a gide and trusty mate, in fearefull flight I found. Through sondry streights and wicked winds, our way she did procure, Yet was by force of Pallas power, from daunger saued sure. And now the gates of vastye Seas, we pray that she may cliue, In Geta streames so longe tyme sought, we may at length ariue. Which when she had conueyde me thus, to Hellespontia port, In narrow trackt away ful longe, she safely did resort. On left syde then our course we tournde, from Astors famous towne, And to their coastes (O Imbria) there, from thence we came a downe. So forth wyth gentle winds when wee, Zerinthia did attaine, In Samothracia there our ship, al weary did remaine, From hence the reache is short, if thou, Stantira seekes to vewe, So farre the happye shippe she did, her maister still pursue. Then on Bistonian fieldes to go, on foote it did me please, My shippe forthwith forsaking there, the Hellespontian seas. Unto Dardanea then which bears, the Authors name, we bend, And thee (O Lampsace) we do seeke, whom rurall Gods defend. Where as the sea doth Seston part, from Abydena towne, Euen whereas helles whilom fell, in narrow seas adowne. From thence to Cizicon which on, Propontis shore do stand, Cizicon the noble worke, of Thessallonians hand. Whereas Byzantia holdeth in, the seas on eyther syde, This is the place of double seas, that keepes the gate so wyde. And here I pray that we may scape, by force of Southren winde, That from Syaneaies rockes in hast, she streight away may finde. And so to Enyochus bayes, and thence by Polleo fall, And caryed thus to cut her way, by Anchilaus his wall. Thence vnto Messembros port, and to Opeson bowres May happly passe (O Bacchus) by, of the the named towres. Nowe vnto Alchachoes we go, which of the walles be sprong, Who fleing forth (men say) did build, herein their houses strong. From which vnto Myletus towne, it safelye may ariue, Whereto the fearce and heauy wrath, of angrye Gods do driue. Which if we may attayne vnto, a lambe there shalbe slaine, Mynerua to: for greater gift, our goods do not sustaine. And you dame Hellens brethren twayne, to whom this Ile do bend, Your double power to both our shippes, we pray that you do lend. The one vnto Simplegades, prepares her way to make, The other through Bistonia, her iorney thence do take. Cause you that since we diuers plats, of purpose go vnto, That she may haue, and so may this, their wyshed winds also. Howe that he made his first booke in his iourneye. Eleg. 11. VVithin this booke what letter be, that thou perhappes shal reede, In troublous time, of careful way, the same was made in deede. For eyther Adtia sawe we there, in could Decembers day. How weeping verse amids the seas, to write I did assay. Or els with double seas in course, I Istmos ouercame, And other shippes thereby in flight, our fellowes so became. When Cycladas amazed were, and marueile much did take, How I among the roring flouds. these verses yet could make. And now my selfe do wonder sore, that in such raging waues, Of minde and seas: my very wits, them selues from daunger saues. For be it maze with care hereof, or madnes we it call, This studye doth repell from minde, my thought and sorrowes all. Oft times in doubtfule minde so tost, by stormy kindes I was: Oft times with Sterops star the Sea, through threatning waues I pas. Arthophilax that keepes the bere, doth darke the day at dawne, And South wind with the waters fearce, the Hiadas haue drawne. Oft times some part thereof did passe, into my shippe aright, Yet trembling I this woful verse, with feareful hand do wright. Now with the Northren windes the ropes, contented are to crake, And like to hilles the hollow Seas, a lofty surging make. The maister wyth his hands cast vp, doth pray wyth fearefull hart, Beholding then the heauenly starres, forgetful of his art. On euerye syde we onlye sawe, of death the picture plaine, Which I in minde did feare and yet, so fearing wisht againe. God graunt I may to port ariue, I feare the fame right sore, In water far lesse daunger is, then on that cursed shore. Of subtill snares of men and flouds, we stand in dreary dreede, The sword and sea my wretched minde, with double terror feede. The one doth hope with giltlesse bloud, a pray of me to make, The other of my woofull death, the fame would gladly take. On left syde dwelles a people rude, whose minds be bent to spoyle, In blamelesse bloud, and slaughter sears, and cruel warres they boyle. And while the washing waters are, with winter flouds so wrought, Our mindes to greater toyle (then seas) by heauy happe be brought. Wherefore thou ought more pardon here (O gentle Reader) haue, If these appeare (as sure it is) much lesse then hope do craue. My Gardens now we want wherein, I wonted was to wright, The vsed beds my body lacks, to rest the wearye night. With bitter winters day I am, in wicked watters throwne, My papers pale with surges soust, the grislye seas haue knowne. The winter angry is that I, these verses dare endight, And dreadfull threatninges casteth there, my purpose so to spight. Of man let winter victor be, in selfe same case I pray, That I may cease my simple verse, and he his raging stay. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seconde booke [To verses which in bookes discribe, to thee thine honor due] To verses which in bookes discribe, to thee thine honor due, From reader ought in iudgement iust, more fauor to ensue. But if thou hap offended be, who then dare be my frend? No skant vnto my selfe I should, my faithfull frendship lend. When as a house decayed is, and setled on the syde, Then all the massye waight thereof, to yelding parts do slyde. Or els whereas by fortunes force, a chincke therein is maide, Wyth paise thereof in tract of time, the fame is sone decaide. The great enuye of men so we, by hurtful verse do finde, And people be (as meete it is) to CÃ¦sars syde enclinde. When as my life and maners yet, were more alowde I knowe, And by the horse the same I iudge, which then thou did bestowe. The which although it profit nought, nor honest prayse I haue, Yet from the name of cruell crime, my selfe I wyshe to saue. Nor cause to mee committed was, of giltye men amis, For Iudges ten times ten to looke, vppon whose office is. And priuate plaints without offence, as Iudge I did decree, With vpright minde the same I gaue, it will confessed bee. And that (O wretch) if latest deedes, had not offended more, Euen by thine owne assent I should, not once be saude before. The latest actes do me destroy, my shippe which safely saild, In depththy seas and swallowing waues, through sturdy storme is faild. No litle part of whelming waues, oppresseth mee alone, But all the flocke of flowing flouds, and Ocean seas in one. Why sawe I ought? myne eyes why haue, I gilty causd to be? Why is my fault vnweeting I, now knowing so well to mee? The nackt Diana Acteon saw, vnwares as he did pas, To hungrye houndes a present praye, no whit the lesse he was. For mightye Gods do punish those, by chaunce that do offend, Nor pardon ought where powers be hurt, to such mishappes do lend. So in that daye wherein I was, wyth error thus begild, Our litle house decayed is, wyth fault yet vndefild. And litle though: yet of good fame, euen in my fathers dayes, Nor vnto none inferiour now, for honours noble prayse. Not for the wealth nor want thereof, it can so wel be knowen, For neyther can because whereof, our knightly name is growen. And be it by our byrth or rente, our house be litle namde, My wits and painefull studyes causd, abroade it hath bene famde. Which though percase I seeme to vse, as yong and wantonlye, Yet by that meane through world so wyde, my famous name do flye. Of Naso eke the name is knowne, amids the learned thronge, Who dare of him the same recorde, no abiect men amonge. This house therefore to muses grate, in great decay is fall, By one offence and carefull cryme, yet not accompted small. But so decayde as ryse it may, if that the raging ire, Of greued CÃ¦sar waxeth rype, to wonted vse retire. Whose gracious mercy is so great, in iudgement of our paine, That not so much as we did feare, we haue receyued plaine. Our life is geeuen and not my death, his gentle wrath doth craue, Wyth vsed power (O noble Prince) we pray therefore to saue. I haue also with thine assent, my fathers liuings all, As though my life thou did accompt, a gift that were to small. My doolefull deedes hast not condemde, by Senates close assent. Nor by decree of them opprest, in wretched exile sent. Wyth thretning woords rebuking vice (as best a prince be seeme) Offences all thou doest reuenge, and mercy so esteeme. And those decrees which were pronounce, in sterne and asper wyse, Yet in the name of lighter fault, thou wild it should suffise. Thus as dischargd and sent away, no exiles name I haue, My happye dayes depryuing so, and life thereby to saue. No paine or griefe so greeuous is, no trouble such of minde, As to displease so great a Prince, his vengeance therto finde. But Gods which whilom moued were, sometimes appeased bee, And skowling cloudes once driuen asyde, a day full fayre we see. The Elme which lately blasted was, depryued of his greene, The clustred vynes eftsones to beare, full oftentimes is seene. And though thou do forbid to hope, we hope assuredlye, This one thing yet may come to passe, though thou therto denye. My hope encrease (O gentle Prince) when thee I do behould, And eke decrease when I respect, my faults so manyfould. The roring rage of swelling seas, is not alike alwaye, Nor furyes fearce doth euer last, in tossing streames to staye. But sometimes be more calme and cleare, and cease their vsed toyle, To make vs thincke the force were lost, of billowes boistrous broyle. So do my feares both ryse and fall, sometime in doubt remayne, In hope and dreade of thy good will, to passe or proue my payne, For loue of Gods therefore which geeue, the long and happye dayes, (If they of noble Romaynes do) esteeme the name and prayse) For countrye eke which thou do keepe, as gyde and father deare, Whereof my selfe a part I was, and thence now passed cleare. To thee the stately towne so shall, wyth honours due resound, Who doost for wit and famous factes, in wonderous wyse abound. So Liuia wyth thee remayne, and liue in wedded lyfe, Which were but euen for the alone, a farre vnworthy wyfe. To Augustus CÃ¦sar. Elegia. 1. VVith you what thing haue I ado, my bookes my haples care, Sith that my wittes (O wretche) because, y? I of life dispare. My verse condempned muses why? repete I now againe, And is it not enough that I, haue once thus suffered paine? My verses lo a meane haue beene, by heauy hap so growen. That I alas on euery syde, to man and wyfe am knowen. By verses eke doth CÃ¦sar note, me and my maners all, Through peruers art which now of late, in deepe disdaine is fall. My paineful studies set asyde, no faultes of lyfe remayne, That giltye I imputed am, my verse hath caused playne. This we receiue as prise of life, and labors great of minde, And now my painfull pinching paynes, in wofull wit I finde. If wyse I were I should of right, the learned sisters blame, As greuous goddesses to such, as worshippe will the same. But madnes now wyth feuer fearce, are ioyned so in one, That mindeful yet of former payne, my foote doth strike the stone. Like as the wounded souldiour doth, resort the field vnto, Or as the wracked shippe doth seeke, on swelling seas to go. Perhappes like him which once within, Thutrantus Realme did raigne, The same which made this greuous wound, thereof may ease the paine. And angry muse which moued ire, the same likewyse remoue, For weeping verse do grace obtayne, at mighty Gods aboue. The worthy Dames of Italye, doth CÃ¦sar wil to pray, To Ops which stately towers beare, and sounding verse to say. The like to Phebus eke, what time, were playde the pleasant playes, Which neuer oftner could be seene, but once in one mans dayes. Lo these (O gracious CÃ¦sar now) as happye myrrors haue, And let my wittes more milder wrath, of thee hereafter craue. The same is iust I do confesse, nor my deserts denye, Nor shame so farre departed is, from fearefull face to flye. But if I had offended nought, what could you then bestowe? My let therefore occasion is, whereof that mercy growe. So oftentimes as mortall men, in sinfull faultes be found, If Ioue should strike he might in time, lacke shot wherewith to wound. But he when once with thondring noyse, haue thretned sore the land, Wyth strinkled drops the cloudy ayre, is cleared out of hand. A God, a gide, a father graue, of right he cald haue beene, As mighty Ioue nothing so great, in vasty world is seene. Sith the also a father graue, and gide in earth they name, Use then of Gods the maners milde, thy power it is the same. The which ful well thou do: nor no, man wyth more equall hand, The rightful reanes could better hold, wherwith to rule the land. The Parthians proude thou did subdue, yet pardon oft bestowe. Which they to thee in case alike, would not haue geeuen I knowe. With worldly wealth and honors high, aduaunced many bee, Whose giltye hands did weapons weare, in field aduers to thee. The day also which moued ire, thy wrath away did take, So eyther part in sacred house, at once their offrings make. And as the souldiour doth reioyce, who did thy foes oppresse, So haue the captiues cause enough, to ioy at such distresse. My cause yet better is: I weare no weapon so vntrue, Nor ennemyes gilty goodes I do, wyth greedy lust pursue. By seas, by lande, by starrye skye, lo here I make my vowe, By the also that present is, a God to whom I bowe. That this good will (O most of might) haue euer beene in mee, And as thine owne with hart and soule, I sought alwayes to bee. I wished oft that here thou might, in earth haue liued longe, And one I was that prayed thus, amids the mighty thronge. And sacrifice for this I gaue, and wyth mine owne assent, When publike prayers were pronounce, to helpe to this entent. My bookes my fauty factes also, what neede I haue in minde, Wherein thy name a thousand times, in open place I finde. Beholde likewyse my greater workes, vnended as they bee, Where that transformed bodyes are, in wondrous wyse to see. There shalt thou finde by flittering fame, thy name haue had much prayse, There shalt thou finde the pledges great, of louing minde alwayes. Thy glory yet no verse can well, augment in any wyse, Syth nothing may thereto be put, whereby it might aryse. Of Ioue the fame doth farre exceede, yet doth it him delight, When as the same in stately verse, we seemely do endight. If that by Gyants bloudye warres, of mention ought be harde, At prayse thereof he doth reioyce, for trouth we do regarde. But the do others honour more, and as it seemeth fit, Thy princely prayse and royall fame, do prayse wyth ryper wit. And as wyth shedding giltlesse bloud, of bulles a hundreth slaine, Of God wyth smallest ensence geeuen, so grace we do obtaine. O wicked wight, O tyrant fearce, O cruell cursed foe, That did my pleasant fancyes make, to thee disclosed soe. Stande you aloofe you vestall tapes, of shamefastnes the sines, Geue place likevvyse ye purfled Pavvles, that halfe on feete declines. Of lavvfull lore and skil aloude, vvee onely do resounde, For in our simple verse there shall, no subtill cryme be founde. Lo do we not all sober Dames, from this our art expell? Whom stole and tape forbiddeth plaine, wyth louely loue to mell? But matrones may more arts inuent, (although they be vntaught,) Whereby to make the chastest mindes wyth wickednes be fraught. No bookes therefore let matrones reade, (sith all things be so straunge) That they be tournd from vertues vse, to filthye vice to chaunge. Who so doth care all thinges to tourne, to wrong and worser part, To vices vile his maners chaunge, through wil of workers hart. For take in hande the Cronicke bookes, (then those nothing more graue) How Ilia fayre a babe brought forth, to reade there shalt thou haue. Or if thou looke on Maroes workes, there shalt thou see in sight, How Venus fayre a mother was, vnto the Troyan knight. Yea further yet (if althinges may) likewyse accompted bee, No kinde of verse but may the minde, corrupt also wee see. As giltye yet not euery booke, we may therefore dispyse, For of eche thinge that helpe proceeds, doth harme also aryse. Then fyre what thing more needefull is? yet who so lookes in lande, The houses highe to burne and spoyle, the fyre he takes in hande. So Phisicke sometimes greatly hurts, sometimes doth heale right well, Of herbes that hurtfull be or not, by skilful lore to tell. The theefe and ware wayfaring man, by syde a sword they haue, The one to robbe the simple wight, the other himselfe to saue. And Rethoricke haue longe time beene taught, to plede for righteousnes, Yet fautye folkes it oft defendes, and innocentes oppres. Euen so who shall my verses reade, wyth equall vprighte minde, Shall well perswade himselfe enoughe, no hurt in them to finde. And who so thinkes he sinne conceyues, or vices hereof haue, Both erreth much, and wrytings mine, to much he doth depraue, In sacred playes (I do confesse) be certaine wanton fits, The stages thereof do remoue, whereon the players sits. What causes also haue bene geeuen, of sinne, and great mischaunce, In marshall fields and places great, where fighters do aduaunce? Let Cyrcus eke be set asyde, the vse thereof not good, The maydens chast thereon at playes, by men vnknowen they stood. While men do rome in selfesame path, where louers do resort, Why then be porches set at large, where all men may disport. What place then temples is more large? yet is there cause of sin, If wicked mindes that so delightes, by hap be set therein, For set in sacret house of Ioue, perchaunce it may be seene, What nomber great of mothers made, by mighty Ioue haue beene. Or who shal in Temples pray, of Lady Iuno true, The Gods she there vewayling sees, and wanton lemans vewe. So some wil aske that Pallas see, as they her picture pas, How that of her Eriththonius, by sinne conceyued was. And comming to the house, shall see, of Mars the heauenly wight, Before the gates where Venus stands, fast by her worthy knight. In Isis Churche who chaunce to sit, will haplye aske in doubt, By Iouian and the Rosphore seas, why Iuno sent her out. For Venus there Anchises is, for Luna Latinius old, For Cetes eke doth Iasius stand, on whom thou mayst beholde. All these thinges therefore may corrupt, the wicked peruers minde, Yet in their place full harmelesse stand, not wrested from their kinde. Far from this art which written was, for wanton Dames behoue, The formost leafe of that same booke, all modest hands remoue. Who so therefore by hap offend, more then the liuers chast? With gilty men of fault forbode, shal he straight wayes be plast? No haynous act the wanton verse, it is to lightly reede, For many thinges the chast may see, which be abhord in deede. The Matrones graue do oft behold, the baudy harlots loue, How naked there themselues they make, dame Venus pranckes to proue. The vestall eyes likewyse they do, the strompets body see, Yet to themselues by sight thereof, no paynes deserued bee. But why haue I so much alas, my muse to wanton made? Or what haue causd my wicked booke, to louely lore perswade? No thing saue sinne and open fault, of force I must confesse, My wits and skill I do accuse, as cause of my distresse. Why haue I not the Troyan towne, by Gretians whilom sackt, In Asper verse the same renude, and tould that famous facte? Why spake I not of Thebas siege, and wounded brethren twayne, And how the seuen gates thereof, in sondry charge remayne? And marshall Rome occasion gaue, whereof I should endight, A godly worke it were for mee, my countrye factes to wright. In fine: whyle that by thy deserts, all thinges so much abounde, A cause I had (O CÃ¦sar) why thy prayse I should resounde. Euen as the eyes delighted be, with beames of Phebus bright, So did thy factes my mind entise, to take thereof delight. As rightfully I am reproude, in barren fielde I tilde, That noble worke is far more large, with greater plenty fielde. For though the slender boate is bould, in smaller streame to play, Yet like disport it dareth not, in surging seas assay. If shee were not, a single life, should best beseeme for thee, For none there liues to whom thou might, a wedded husband bee. Of thee so shall a sonne in health, and thou in health to rayne, Which may, in thy more elder age, an old man here remayne. And bring to passe that happye starres, through those thy noble deedes, Wyth neuewes yong shal still abide, that thee in Realme succedes. So victorye which vsed is, thy noble Castels too, Shal still be prest at hand alwayes, to customde ensignes goo. She shal wyth wonted winges stil flye, wyth gide of Lauin land, On happy heade a Laurell greene, shall set wyth seemely hand. By whom thou famous warres do keepe, in parson also fight, To whom good lucke by thee is geeuen, wyth Gods of marlous might. And thus in mighty towne art seene, as present halfe to byde, And halfe away in further parts, the bloudy warres to gyde. A victor great from foes subdude, he shal returne to thee, Wyth crowned horse and triumphes braue, aduaunced shal he bee. But spare we pray thy lightning fearce, and cruel shot vp laye, Whereof (O wretch) we haue alas, to long now made assaye. Thou art our countrye father deare, not mindles of this name, We pray the spare and graunt vs hope, in time to haue no blame. To come againe I do not craue, yet wel beleeue we maye, That mighty Gods more harder suits, haue not denide alwaye. A gentler kinde of exiles life, and nerer place bestow, Then of my paynes the greatest part, woulde be allayde I know. The furthest lande I do approue, and cast among my foes, Nor no man from his country, that, so far an exile goes. In hauen of seuenfould Istars sea, alone here am I sent, Wyth frostye axe of Archadie, in cruell care am pent. The Iazegies, the Colchos eke, and all the Getean rout. With Metereins whom Danube streame, may skante from hence keepe out. And though that diuers be driuen forth, for much more great offence, Yet none to place more far then I, is sent away from thence. Beyond this land no thing there is, saue cold and ennemyes fell, With waters thinne of whelming sea, wyth frosty Ise congell. On left syde here Euxinians ioyne, to part of Romaine land, And next the Basterns and the Savvromes keepe wyth cruel hand. This is the lande that latest came, to rule of Romayne lawe, And skantly any part thereof, thine Empyre neare do drawe. Wherefore I humblye pray that we, be set in safer soile, Lest els wyth losse of countrye deare, we liue in endlesse toile. So neede we not the Nations feare, whom Istar skant deuide, Nor as thy subiectes there be tane, wyth cruel foes to bide: For no man borne of Latian bloud, can beare those barberous bands, But that they will a burden be, vnto CÃ¦sarians hands. Two faults there are that haue me slaine, error, and my verse, All other faults I thincke it good, that I do not reherse. Thy greuous wounds (O CÃ¦sar) now, renue I do not meane, And that thou haue bewaild them once, to much I do esteeme. An other part of crime remaynes, a greuous fault for mee, A teacher of adoultrye foule, I charged am to bee. Some things the Gods may well deceiue, them for to know is hard, Of them for many be so meane, that thou dost not regard. For while as Ioue beholds the Heauens, and mightye Gods also, The smaller things from loftye skyes, can not respect vnto. So many matters they escape, in vewing world so wyde, That lesse affayres of meaner waight, from heauenlye minde do slyde. That is: while thou a Prince be set, in Empyre large to raigne, May not intend fonde verse to reade, and greater things disdaine. The waighty waight of Romayne name, do not so lightly moue, Nor paise thereof on backe to beare, so litle thee behoue. As thou wyth godly power may marke, our fond and foolish toyes. Wyth open eyes here to discusse, our idle earthly ioyes. Sometimes Germania doth rebell, sometimes Illerians raile, Rhetia and the Thratian land, wyth ciuill warres assaile. Sometimes Atmenius craueth peace, and Parthus weapon yelde, With feareful hands restoring eft, the ensignes won in fielde. Germania eke thronge infant yong, a yong man thee do take, And CÃ¦sar doth full cruell warres, for mighty CÃ¦sar make. In fine: of all thine Empyre huge, (which neuer was so large) No part at all abated is, but still remaynes in charge. The Cittye great and sure defence, of customes and of lawe, Doth irke the sore: while them thou seekes, thine owne more nere to drawe. The quiet state thou can not vse, which thou hast stald in land, For troublous ware wyth nations great, thou daily takes in hand. Wherefore among such causes graue, I maruel much and muse, That thou our wonted follyes would, wyth earnest eyes peruse. But if thou had (as I do wishe) more idle there haue beene, Then in myne art no fault at all, perhaps thou should haue seene. The which I do confesse was not, deuisde with seuere heade, Nor matter meete that might deserue, of such a Prince be reade. Yet be they not to lawes offence, nor giltye of such blames, But to enstruct the youthfull route, of noble Romayne Dames. Nor needest not my bookes to doubt, for in one of those three, These verses fower which next approch, be set therein to see, And doubting that for greater things, my minde is farre vnfit, In dittyes small it may suffice, that I do shew my wit. But if thou should commaund to tell, of Giants greuous wounds, Which they through fyre of Ioue did feele: the worke my wit confounds. A fruitfull minde it doth requyre, of CÃ¦sars actes to wright, Lest els perhappes with matter much, the worke may want his right. Which though I durst haue take in hand, yet dreading much amonge, Thy noble power I might abate, which were to great a wronge. To lighter worke I therefore went, and youthfull verse addrest. Wyth fayned loue a care I had, to feede my ficcle brest. Which loth I was ful longe to do, but fates did so ordaine, And deepe desire my minde did moue, to purchas greuous paine. Why haue I learnde? O wretche why haue, my parentes taught me lore? On letters smal why haue I set, my woful eyes before? For this I am of thee enuide, by wanton art aright, Through which thou thinckes the chasty beds, be traynde to foule delight. But none whom wedlocks yoke doth binde, this craft haue learnde of mee, For who so nothing knowes himselfe, no teacher can he bee. So haue I made both pleasant toyes, and gentle facile verse, As yet in talke for by worde lewde, no wight maye me reherse. Nor none who liues in wedded life, amonge the common rought, That of himselfe a father false, through my default do dought. My maners milde repugnant are, to verse (beleeue you mee) My life both chast and shamefast is, though muse more pleasant bee. And greatest part of those my workes, inuentions are vntrue, For much more craft they do allowe, then maker euer knewe. Nor written bookes do not purport, thaffections of the minde, But honest will to pleasant myrth, to make the eares inclinde. For Accius then in cruell deedes, Terentius should delight, In bankets braue: and warriours be, of warres that do endight. In fine: though diuers are with mee, that tender loue haue mayde, Yet I alone for it (O wretch) the paynes alone haue payed. Theia muse of Leryan olde, hath she not taught the skill? With plentye great of Baccus dewe, dame Venus nest to fill? What hath dame Sapho Lesbia learnde, but maydens fayre to loue, Yet Sapho still remayneth safe, and he no paynes do proue. What hath it thee (O Battis) hurt, that reading of thy verse, Thy pleasant pranckes thou did confesse, and wanton ioyes reherse. No fable founde but tels of loue, in great Menanders booke, Yet is it redde to virgens yonge, and boyes thereon do looke. What shall you reade in Ilias, but foule adulterous life? And fearce afflict of louers false, with toyle and endles strife. Therein what is there set before, of Crisyda the loue? And of the mayde from Captaynes caught, which anger great did moue. What is Odissea els? but while Vlisses was awaye, How of his wyfe the loue to get, what woers did assaye. What doth great Homer more report, but Mars to Venus bound, And that they were in filthy bedde, and foule adulterye found. By him haue we not knowledge caught, that moude wyth loues desyre? One straunger causd too goddesses, to burne in secret fyre? Though Tragedyes all wrytings do, surmount for matter graue, Yet euen in them occations great, of loue alwayes we haue. For in Hypolitus the loue, of Phedra do we finde, And eke how constant Canace loude, her brother not vnkinde. What did not then king Pelops white, when Cupid forcte his chaire, With Phrigian horses ferce conueye, Hippodamia faire? Prouoked grefe through loues desire, in some so much it was, That mothers causde their cruell blades, through childrens bloud to pas. And loue: a kinge wyth leman fayre, in fethred foules did cha?ge, And made sir Itis mother mourne, wyth sithes and sobbings straunge. If that Europaes brother vile, her loue did not requyre, Wyth Phebus: then we had not read, how horses did retyre. Nor Scilla should haue so attaynd, the Traiecke stile vnto, Unlesse that loue her father forcte, his fatall heares forgo. Whose by hap Electran reades, and mad Orestes fitte, Egistes faults nor Clytemnestrais, sinnes, he can forgitte, What neede I speake of Victor that, Chymera did oppresse? Whom craftye gest did much anoye, to death almost distresse. Who hath not spoke of Hermyone, and the Cheneyda tould? Of Alcumeane whom Mycene Duke, in louing brest did fould. What Daneyes daughter in lawe? her selfe? what Baccus Dame? What Hemmona wyth her which causde, of one too nights became? Of Duke Admete, of Thesius eke, what should I here resounde, Of Greeke whose shippe did first ariue, on coast of Phrigian grounde. Let Ioles come among the rest, wyth Deiedamia fayre, Wyth Hylas to and Ganimede, who did to heauen repayre. No time would serue the Traiecke fyres, if I for them should looke, Whose names alone could not be set, wythin this careful booke. And Traiedies the laughters foule, prouoke in sondry wyse, Yea shamelesse wordes full many a one, because of them aryse. What hath it hindred him that did, the fearce Achill abuse? For which his valiant deedes were lost, and force did him refuse. Aristides the filthy facts, of fond Mylesians tould, Yet from his towne was not exild, nor in such wyse contrould. Nor Eubius a wryter great, of historyes vncleane, How mothers might their seede consume, by foule and filthye meane. Nor he who wrote the bookes, which men, Sabarita haue namde, Nor they whose owne adulterous deedes, to tell were not ashamde. All these wyth graue and ancent sawes, of learned men be vsde, The facts apparant be yet not, to princes so refusde. Nor I these forreine factes alone, for my defence do finde, But euen in Romayne bookes I reade, the toyes of wanton minde. As Ennius graue who wonted was, of mighty Mars to tell, Ennius though voyde of arte, in wit he did excell. Lucretius eke the cause discust, of fearce consuming flame, And triple worke he did deuine, of which procedes the same. So did Catullus wanton man, his lemans prayse resight, Whose name in deede he chaunged haue, and Lesbia therefore hight. Nor yet contented so but did, of harlottes mo reherse, Wyth whom adultery vyle he did, confesse in open verse. Like lawles life did Caluus leade, whose stature was but small, By sondry meanes disclosing then, his filthy doings all. What should I speake of Tyndaies stile, and Memnus verse also, Who wryting of vnhonest actes, their names haue put vnto. And Cinna here a fellow is, and Anser light as hee, And Cornificius wanton, worke, and Catoes eke we see. And he who in Phacecian seas, that Argos whilom brought, His secrete deedes could not keepe in, which he before had wrought. Hortencius and Sulpitius facts, lassiuious be likewise, And such graue men who followeth not, or doth their deedes dispyse. Sisenna did Mylesian bookes, reduce to Romayne verse. No paynes he proued yet, though flithy factes he did reherse. Nor Gallus though Lycordia fest, he did oft times adore. Was blamed ought: but deemed droncke, wyth wyne he bibd before. To womans othes small trust to haue, Tybullus whilom would, Nor of themselues what they denide, no husband credit should. For keepers eke of virgens chast, a fraude he did confesse, And now (O wretch) through selfesame art, is driuen to deepe distresse. And as he would of signet fayre, or Iewels vertue finde, By craft whereof his mystres hand, to touche he beares in minde. By priuy pointes and crafty becks, to shewe theyr secrete minde, He also taught: and subtile notes, in trenchers fayre to finde. And by the sappe of certaine herbes, how wrath is set a syde, Whereas the same through mutuall mouthes, by strents of teeth do glyde. And eke how they should plentye great, of foolishe husbands craue, Whereby the lesse they might offende, and lesse occasion haue. At whom also the dogges do barcke, when men that way are gone, And secrete hems he taught to know, when he did passe alone. Ful many a crafty lore he learnde, which women did receiue, Euen by what art the wedded wyues, their husbandes might deceiue. For these yet no rebuke he had, his workes apparant bee, And wel alowde, to the our Prince, are not vnknowen we see. Propertitus like preceptes haue geeuen, which be apparant plaine, No checke or frowning loke he did, for that although sustaine. And many more I did succeede, who (sith they liue in fame) I will not now in open verse, resite them by their name. I feared not (I do confesse) amonge so great a sayle, My onely shippe to perishe quite, and none but she to fayle. And other artes with trouling dyce, lo diuers written haue, Through which no small offence is cast, vppon your grandsers graue. How that thou may by subtill meane, the greatest nomber throw, And dogged pointes may best eschew, through crafty art to know. In Tables play what markes auayle, or hurtful are likewyse, A skill they haue to vse the good, and loosing pointes dispyse. And how the knight in coullers clad, doth rage in right forts way, When midle man through ennemyes twayne, assault is made a pray. And how they best may march abrode, or forman make retyre, Nor none alone from warde to passe, for feare of hurtful hyre. A game also with little stones, so placte on table small, Where at he wynnes that makes al three, in one streight lyne to fall. And other playes deuised be (nor all to tell I meane) Through which oure time a thing most deare, is so consumed cleane. And others tels the forme of balles, and skill of tennis playes, And some the swimming art doth show, and some the toppe assayes. The craft with coullers blacke to stayne, do diuers take in hand, Of banket bowers and householde lawes, haue others deepelye skand. Of earth do others teache the vse, whereof they cuppes do make, And which the wyne preserues and which, wil other liquor take. Such kinde of sportes in smokye month, of colde Decembers daye, Are vsed yet: nor maker none, for them the paynes do paye. Through these examples lo I haue, no weeping verses mayd, But weeping paynes for pleasant sports, I haue alas assayd. In fine:among these wryters all, I can perceyue not one, To whom his muse haue hurtful beene, my selfe except alone. What if I should the filthy playes, of rayling iesters wright, Wherein the faults of fayned loue, be set alwayes in sight. And where the vibus man comes forth, in garments freshe and braue, And wilye wife her foolish mate, by sleight deceyued haue. Lo these: both mayde wyfe and man, wyth seely children see, And oftentimes the Senate hole, in parson present bee, The which alone wyth shameles speache, do not defile the eare, But filthy facts before the eyes, they haue disclosed there. And when the louer by his craft, the husband doth begyle, They clap their handes with wondrous ioy, and great reioysing smyle. And that although lesse needeful is: for Poetes greedy gayne, The Preror will of forged playes, wyth charge the sight attayne. Behold of playes the great expence (O CÃ¦sar) and the charge, Which thou hast payd: thou shal perceiue, the same haue beene right large. Lo these thy selfe ful oft haue seene, and shewed to others plaine, Thy maiestye so lowly is, thy grace nothing disdaine. The royall eyes wherewyth thou do, the totall world beholde, Thadultrye vile haue gladly seene, which that in Scene is tolde. Wherefore if lawfull that it be, that iestars so may wright, My deedes lesse paynes deserue, they do, more honest actes resight. But is that kind of wryting safe, for pulpets hault regard? And what the stage haue lawfull made, from iesters not debard? So haue the people daunced oft, when songe my poises beene, With open eyes the same also, thy selfe oft times haue seene. Euen as the auncient pictures made, by craft of workemans hand, With glistering gloose be set in sight, within your house to stand. In them so be there tables smal, in priuate place I know, Which sondry shapes and secrete deedes, of Ladye Venus show. And as the irefull Aiax sits, wyth threatning browes all bent, Or as the barberous mothers eye, to wicked act is lent. Euen so the watry Venus sits, her dampish heres to drye, And sometimes seemes in mother seas, away from sight to flye. And others be which cruel warres, wyth weapons sharpe do tell, Yea some thy grandsires deedes and some, thine owne do show right well. In narrowe space the hateful wight, dame Nature hath me pent, Nor to my wofull wayling wits, but slender force haue lent. O happye yet for him it was, Eneados did wright, Who Moorian beds with mighty men, and weapon fierce resight. No part of which famous worke, the readers do delight, So much: as that, where loue was linckt, againe al honest right. Of Phyllis he likewise haue tould, and Amarillis loue, In youthfull yeares he sought his minde, wyth Bucolix to moue. And we who haue by wryting these, committed greuous sinne, Our sinfull factes much elder be, though paynes but now beginne. I verses also made when thou, offences haue contrould, A knight by thee to passe oft times, I voyde of checke was bould. Wherefore I yong and wanting wit, in that no daunger thought, Which now to me in elder age, more hurtfull care haue brought. A new reuenging paines I feele, for auncient written art, The persecution differeth far, from time of my desart. Yet of my woorkes you may beleeue, more waighty burdens bere, For oftentimes more massye sayles, my ship sustayned there. For bookes twyse six I wrytten haue, and Fastus did them name, In nomber like of monthes were made, and ended in the same. And that that through my heauy fate, I did (O CÃ¦sar) make, Wherein I highly honoured thee, when I my waye did take. Yea Tragike style in royall verse, we also did endight, Wherein no waighty words do want, that stately stile should light. In verse likewyse we tould, although, the workes imperfit beene, Where sondrye shapes transformed are, and chaunged bodyes seene. But would to God thy wrath a while, from minde thou would remoue, And that of these some part to reade, thou wouldest me behoue. The worke which at the worlds vpryse, his first beginning had, To thy most famous raigne I brought, and wrote (O CÃ¦sar) glad. There shalt thou finde what store of wit, on me thou whilom layed, And wyth what minde for thee and thine, to write I haue assayed. I do no man wyth byting verse, or churlishe checke disdaine, Nor no mans gilty factes there doth, wythin my woorkes remayne. From subtil ioyes I giltles am, that tempred be wyth gall, Nor in my verse no venome fell, wyth myrth is mixt at all. Among so many thousand men, wyth verses many a one, My learned muse haue hindred none (my selfe except alone) At my mishap I gesse therefore, no Romayne doth reioyce, But much bewayle our sondry woes, wyth one lamenting voyce. Nor no man would I thincke be sad, in this my sorrye chaunce, If mercye me through giltles life, to greater ease aduaunce. Lo these wyth many more I wyshe, maye perce thy heauenly brest, (O father deare) O sure defence, our countryes onlye rest. To Italie I would not turne, vnlesse in longer space, Through greater paynes, of the perhappes, we may deserue more grace. More safer place for exiles life, and gentler rest I craue, So shall my faults and carefull crymes, their due deseruings haue. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The thirde booke. The booke to the Reader. Elegia. 1. In feareful wyse an exiles baoke, am sent the towne to see, Thy helpinge hand, to weary frend (O Reader) lend thou mee. Nor doubt thou not least I because, perhappes to worke thy shame, No verse in this doth teache to loue, whereby to force the same. Nor maisters fortune hath beene such, alas vnhappie wight, That he wyth iestes or pleasant toyes, ought hide the same from sight. And that which he in greener yeares, hath made vnluckelye, To late (O woful worke) doth now, wyth hatefull hart defye. Behold therefore what I do bringe, saue sorrowes nought at all, Such matter meete in weeping woords, as doth to time befall. Eche other lyne a limping verse, that here in sight is seene, The weary foote or length of way, the cause thereof haue beene. I am not staynd in Cedars sappe, nor wrought wyth Pumyse bright, For shame it were to be more braue, then maister may wyth right. The letters sad whereof the blots, bereft of wonted grace, The sorry teares that worke hath hurt, which fell from Poets face. If any word he wrested haue, from light of latin sence, The barbarous lande haue forct thereto, and cause proceded thence. Then tell, if payne be, none which waye, (O Reader) is most sure, And by what steps a straungers booke, my passage may procure. While these I spake wyth stamering tongue, and closely all alone, My iorneye lo: that told there was, amonge them all but one. God graunt thou may, which Naso to, hath beene denyed plaine, That in thy countrye here mayst byde, and quiet rest obtaine. Gyde on I shall pursue, although, by seas and lande I sought, All tyred longe my wearye feete, from furthest countrye brought. Obeying then and passing forth (quoth he) this is the gate, Of CÃ¦sars Court: and way the name, from Gods haue growen but late. This is the vestal place that keepes: dame Pallas and the fyre, This is the pallace smal whereto, king Numa did aspyre. From hence on left syde looke (quoth hee) Saturnus house do stande, Here Romulus the loftye Rome, to build did take in hande. And wondring much: forthwyth in sight, I glittring armour spyde, And royal gates wyth heauenly bowers, in perfit vew discryde. Behold of Ioue the house (quoth I) which we may so deuyne, By royall crowne of okeing tree, that high thereon do shyne. His name once hard forthwith I said, we haue deuined well, Of mighty Ioue it is the house, and he therein do dwell. But lo what cause the noble gates, be hid with Lawrell greene? Or why the tree with braunches spred, hath made his heere vnseene? For that this house of tryumphes braue, deserues eternal fame? Or els because Apollo great, doth dearely loue the same? Or that it sacred is? or els, all thinges of it must neede? Or els of peace the tokens plaine, on totall earth do spreede? For as the Lawrell greene doth growe, and neuer fades awaye, So endlesse honor here remaynes, which yeldes to no decaye. The letters eke which written be, about the stately Crowne, The ensines be of his defence, the Cittizenes haue foune. One faythful man except alone, who driuen ful far away, Doth lurke aloofe in furthest lande, opprest in deepe decay. Who though he doth confesse himselfe, to haue deserued paine, No wicked deede was cause thereof, but error proued plaine. At royall place and mighty man, O wretche for feare I shake, And dolefull wofull letters small, through trembling dred do quake. Thou doest behold to sickely hewe, my paper pale do chaunge, And dost regard eche other foote, to hault with tremblinge straunge. And at what time before the Lords, and rulers of the place, In sight thou shalbe set: I pray the plead the parentes case. From thence wyth slender pausing pace, to lofty steps was brought, And stately Temples built on high, of great Apollo sought. Euen where on mighty pillers plaine, the noble pictures stand, Belides: and the cruell syre, wyth naked sword in hand. And where the auncient wryters learnd, with learned hand did wright, Which readers all may there beholde, and there do stand in sight. My brethren there I looked for, saue those, I could not finde, Whose byrth the father did repent, and so did wishe in minde. And seeking there in vaine about, the keeper of the place, Did will me from those sacred staules, to passe wyth speedy pace. To Temples next which ioyned were, in hast I did depart, From whence my feete were forct to fle, for feare of further smart. Nor that which wonted was alway, the learned bookes to take, Would suffer mee to touch the same, but clerely did forsake. The heauy fate of wretched fyers, to ofspring doth discend, And fathers feareful flight to vs, his children doth extend. Yet may it hap in time to come, through length of longer space, That we, and hee of CÃ¦sar may, obtayne more milder grace. The Gods for this I pray, and yet (saue CÃ¦sar none at all) That they wyth heauenly eares attende, to this our humble call. And seing that the publicke staules, to vs denyed beene, In priuate place it may be free, to lurcke therein vnseene. And you also ye simple hands (if it so lawfull bee) Our carefull verse receiue likewyse, wyth modest eyes to see. And was it my destneis than, the Sythean land to see? And in that lande that vnderlyeth, the Northren Poale to bee? Not to your Poet sacred Nymphes, and learned cunning flocke, Haue succour sheewed: which boast your selfe, of dame Dianayes stocke. Nor that deuoyde of verye cryme, I wrote did profit ought, And eke my muse more wanton far, then life I euer fought. But after perils many past, by seas and lande wyth payne, In Pontus ile dryde vp wyth colde, aye lasting I remayne. And I that borne to quiet rest, auoyding busye broyle, Full tender and impacient was, of labors pinching toyle. Extreames I suffer nowe, nor mee, the seas depriude of port, Nor sondrye wayes cold yet destroy, by which I made resort. But ils my minde resisted haue, of which my body worne, Repayres his force and suffreth things, skant hable to be borne. Yet while wyth winds and whelming waues, I doubtfully am tost, My gryping cares and heauy hart, wyth trauaile great is lost. But when my way was ended once, and iorneying worke gan rest, And I a land wherein to waile, my greuous paine possest. Naught els saue weepe I would, nor from, myne eyes a smaller shower, Did flowe: then when the Spring time warme, doth winter snow deuower. My house and Rome remember I, wyth want of wonted place, And what soeuer thing of mine, doth Citty least embrace. O heauye chaunce so oft alas, as I haue knockt on gate, Of greedy graue, but yet no time, cold enter in thereat. Why haue I scapt so many swords, so oft with threatning dread? Why hath not sturdy storme ouerwhelmde, this my vnhappye head? O Gods whom I to wrathfull, and, in wrath to constant proue, Pertakers of displeasers which, one only God doth moue. Hast on prouoke I humblye pray, the lingring longed fates, And let not death be able eft, to shut his grisely gates. To his wyfe. Eleg. 3. If marueile ought (my louing wyfe) thy minde perhappes detayne? Why others hand these letters wrote? my sickenesse caused playne. In partes extreame of furthest lande, wyth feuer sore opprest, Of wonted health I was almost wyth deadly doubt distrest. What minde thinckes thou I had, when as, in Region rude I laye? Betweene the Savvromes and the Getes, was forced here to straye? The ayre thicke cold not be borne, nor waters vsed bee, And land it selfe I know not how, to nature disagree. No houses apt nor meate for such, whom sickenes doth agreue, Nor none that could by Phisicks art, my deepe disease releue. No frend that might my mind comfort, nor driue wyth wordes awaye, The lingring time: to passe wyth speede, and greuous paynes alaye. All tyred thus in furthest place, and landes my byding haue, And eche thing clearely wantinge there, my longing mind do craue. Yet though nothing my wish did want, (O wyfe thou art most deare,) And of my brest thou dost possesse, and hold the place most neare. To thee alone though absent farre, my voyce by name doth call, No day but still of thee I heare, nor sound of ought at all. And though oft times occasion moues, to speake of other things, As mad my tongue thy name doth touch, and forth the same it brings. Yea though I sounded were and tongue, to mouth were fixed sure, And that no drop of pleasant wynes, cold eft the same recure, Yet hearing that my mistres deare, to presence should be brought, I rouse my selfe: for hope and cause, of strength thereby is wrought. Whyle I in doubt of life remaine, thou passest pleasant dayes, Unweeting cleare of sorrowes mine, percase thou none assayes. Yet doest thou not I dare, affirme: (O thou my dearest wyfe,) In sorrowes sad me absent far, thou leads thine only lyfe. But when as fate my yeares fulfild, which it so ought of right, And when as life my corps hath left, and death performd his spight, What ioy should it be then (O Gods) to graunt to my desyre, On natiue ground to end my dayes, and coorse therein entyre. O would that eyther these my paynes, might yet haue had delaye, Or els that hasting death had come, before I past my waye. In health not long ago it might, my life haue tane from mee, But now an exile here to dye, these pardons graunted bee. So far away shall we be forct, to dye in lande vnknowen? Or shal the place inforce my fate, with greater sorrowes growen? Shal not my corps in wonted beds, consume wyth deadly wound? Or shall there none my death bewayle, when layde I am on ground? Shal not my mystres sorye teares, vppon my face let fall? Nor shall the same wyth lyuing sence, my time prolong at all? Shal not I make my due requestes? nor at the latest crye? Wyth frendly hand shall she not shut, and close my passing eye? But shal my head of funerals, bereft and noble graue? And here in greedy gro?d be put, and no lamentinge haue? Wilt thou not hearing this of mee, wyth minde amazed stande? And faythfull brest wyth waighty strokes, will strike wyth fearefull hande? And hitherwards in vaine although, thy wofull armes stretch out? And on thy wretched husbans name, to crye will nothing doubt? Yet spare thy cheekes (mine owne sweete hart) and louely lookes to rend, This time not first that I from thee, was forct away to bend. When as my countrye deare I lost, thincke then I did away, The first and greatest death I do, esteeme the same alway. Now if thou can: which thou can not, (my best beloued wyfe,) Reioyce my death the ende of woes, that so molested lyfe. And would my soule wyth body might, consumed be in one, So then no part from flashing flames, escaped be alone. For if the sprite doth not depart, but flyes aloft in skyes, And that Pythagoras auncient sawes, as false we not dispyse. My Romayne soule shal wander then, euen wyth the Sythian gost, And eke among the furious spyrits, shal byde alwayes at ost. Yet cause that all my lifelesse boones, be put in one small pot, So shal I not although now dead, an exile be, I wot. For no man did forbid, that when, Thiocles whilom slaine, Antigones should burye him, though kinge denyde it plaine. And mixe my boones wyth pouder drye, of sweete Ammomus tree, And in the subberbes of the towne, let them reposed bee. And letters great in Marble graude, wyth seemely verse deuies, Which on my Tombe the passers by, may well deserne with eyes. EPITAPHE. HERE Naso now beholde I lye, that wrote of tender loue, A Poet learnd whose wits wer cause, that deth did him remoue. And who so here a louer comes, saye thus, if paine be none, God graunt that Nasoes bones abide, in quiet rest eche one. On Tombe these shall suffice: but yet, my bookes shall longer byde, As monuments of mee, which that, no trackt of time shall hyde. And those which Author hurted haue, yet hope I through the same, My time shall more prolonged be, with much encrease of fame. Yet on my coorse the due desertes, of funerals bestowe, And on the watrye garlandes see, thy bitter teares do flowe. And though the fyre doth my coorse, to ashes pale conuart, Yet shal the sorrye sparkes approue, thy godly louinge hart. And now receiue this last farewell, perhaps that I shal make, The which although to thee I sende, my selfe cannot pertake. To his frende that he should eschewe the companye of great men. Elegia. 4. O deare in deede alwayes to me, but in this time distrest, Now trusty tride since myne estate, so sore hath lyen opprest, If ought thou do thy frend beleeue, wel taught by practise proofe. Liue to thy selfe, from haughty names, of might flee thou aloofe. Liue to thy selfe, and for thy power, great noblenes eschewe, Right noble is the Castel whence, this cruell lightning flewe. For though in handes of mighty men, to helpe alone it lyse, They do not helpe but rather hurt, in worsest wicked wyse. The ship whose sayle is stricken lowe, escapes the stormye blast, But slackye sayle and brode extent, more feare then lesser tast. Thou seest how corke wyth litle waight, on top of water fleetes, When heauy loade through paise, it selfe, and nets in bottome weetes. If I myselfe these warnings wyth, had warned beene or this, The towne where right doth wil me dwell, perhaps I should not mis. Whilst yet wyth thee I dwelt and whilst, the pipeling wind be put, This boate of myne through calmy seas, her quiet way she cut. Who falleth on euen ground (as scant, the same doth euer chaunce,) So fauls as when to earth he comes, may vp againe aduaunce. But that poore soule Elpenor fel, a downe from hight of hall, Whose mourneful sprite his king vnto, appeared after fall. What ment it then that Dedalus, his winges cold flicker safe? And Icarus to largye seas, his name assyned gafe? For soth because aloft this one: that other flew belowe, For both of them did others winges, their sides vppon bestowe. Beleeue me this who hidden well: hath lurckt, he liueth well, And eche man ought within his lot, to him appointed dwell. Eumenides should not, beene shieldles, if his foolishe sonne, Had not so much desired on, Achilles horse to ronne. And Merops if to Phaeton, he father still had beene, His sonne in fyre, his daughters and, in trees should not haue seene. So thou likewise for euer feare, to loftye matters hye, And draw together I thee pray, the sayles of purpose nye. For thou well worthy art forthwith, vnspurned foote to ronne, Thy course of life: and haue thy fate, more fauorablye sponne. With gentle loue that I should pray, for thee thou dost deserue, And faythful fayth that wil from mee, at no time euer swerue. With countenaunce like my carefull case, I saw thee to lament, As wel it may beleeued be, my face did represent. I saw thy teares wyth trickling fall, vppon my visage sad, Which all at once were poured forth, wyth trusty wordes thou had. Now thou also thy frend remoude, with dilligence defends, And ils which scant may eased be, with mytigating mends. All voide of enuye see thou liue, wythout renowne dispatch, Thy yeares in quiet and thy selfe, with equal frendship match. And loue the name of Naso thine, which thing is yet alone, Unbanished remaynes, the rest, in Sythia seas be gone. In lande which neerest ioynes to starre, of Erymanthus beare, I byde: where frost congeled hard, the ground wyth cold do ceare. The Bosephor streame and Tanais, wyth other lakes there bee, In Sythia sea and names a fewe, of place skant knowen to mee. And eke there is nothing saue cold, which none can safely byde, Alas how neare the furthest land, approcheth to my syde. But far away my countrye is, and far my dearest wyfe, And what thing els besydes these two, was pleasant in my life? Euen so these thinges be absent as, the same I cannot get, In body: but in minde they may, be all beholded yet. Before mine eyes my house and towne, and forme of places showe, And euery place together wyth, their deedes I shortly know. Before mine eyes like as my wyfe, in present shape appeares, My state she greuous presseth downe, and vp againe she reares. She absent greeues, but lighter makes, that lasting loue she lends, And heauy charge vppon her layd, she constantly defends. So you (O frends) full firmely sticke, within my fixed hart, Whom I desyre to speake vnto, by eche mans name apart. But fainting feare that is beware, my dutye due doth let, And you I thinke vnwilling would, within my verse be set. Afore you would and did regard, it as thy loue most kinde, That in my verse the Reader might, your names so placed finde. Which thing because is doubtful now, in secrete brest eche one, I shal talke wyth and wil be cause, of quaking feare to none. Nor in my verse my hidden frendes, betraying forth I will, Expresse: if any priuely, haue loued loue he still. Know this although in Region farre, is now my resting place, Wyth all my hart you inwardly, I euermore embrace. And by such meanes as eche man may, releeue my ils I pray, Your faithful hand to frend vtcast, in griefe do not denaye. So prosper fortune vnto you, and happy still remaine, As neuer in like lot the same, to aske ye may be faine. To his frende. Eleg. 5. Oure vse of frendshippe hath beene such, that thou wyth litle shame, Through smal acquaint?ce growen before, might wel haue clockte the same In former bands of frendships law, vnlesse thou hadst beene tyde, When that my shippe on safer streame, wyth happye winde did slyde. But when I fell: eche man for feare, did shun my deepe decaye, And wonted frends their wilye backs, from me they turnde awaye. Yet were thou bould my blasted boones, wyth flach of Ioue his fyre, To touch: and to my heauy house, wyth willing minde retyre. That thou but lately knowen performe, myne elder mates refrainde, Of whom skant two or three that now, to me poore wretch remainde. Thy sorry lookes my selfe I sawe, and gaue to them regarde, Thy face wyth teares like myne embrude, and palenes wel nere marde. Thy doolefull drops I beare in minde, and wofull woords eche one, In mouth the teares, in eares thy woords, full deepely now be gone. My naked necke wyth heauy armes, thou frendlye didst embrace, Wyth sithing sobbes did kisses heape, vppon my feareful face. Yea absent now (O frend) I am, by force of thee protected, Thou knowest that (frende) thy name encludes, which may not be detected. And many tokens more I marckt, of thy vncloked loue, Which in my brest I keepe full cloose, and shall not thence remoue. God graunt thou may in quiet state, thy frendes desend, alwaye, Whom nowe in better case thou helpes, of paynes to haue allaye. Yet if that any shall enquyre (as like they wil do sone) What life I leade in this meane space, by fortune all fordone. Saye that some litle hope I haue, that Gods will graunt more grace, From which do not withdraw thine ayde, if thou dost come in place. And whether it I wrongfull craue, or that I do deserue, In what thou may helpe thou thereto, and do not lightly swerue. And loke what skill in conning speach, thou learned hast before, Here on see that thou dost bestowe, to helpe my cause the more. Howe much a man more noble is, so much more free from ire, In valiant harts is sonest quencht, the rage of furies fire. It doth suffice the Lyon fierce to see his ennemye yelde, And not to slee the couching soe, that prostrate lyes in fielde. Yet doth the Wolfe and Beare dispoyle, the yelding pray in place, And eke eche other brutish beast, that springes of ruder race. For what then great Achill was had, in more renowmed fame? And he at Troye olde Priams teares, did not behold for shame. Of Alexanders mercyes great, full sure records we haue, By noble Pharos which doth stand, depainted on his graue. I know the rage of noble mindes, to mercye lightly goo, For Iuno sonne in law he is, that was her mortall foo. In fine: of grace no signes I see, that driues me to distrust, For that my fault no death deserues, of lawes that be so iust. I haue not sought Augustus life, wyth treason vile to slaye, Of totall earth the onlye head, to whom all men obaye. I nought haue said nor babling tongue, haue spoken ought amis, If I therefor offended haue, the wyne the causer is. My giltlesse sight my payne haue wrought, which I therefore do blame. From loking eyes my griefe doth grow, euen thus proceds the same. Yet can I not my sondrye crymes, defend against all right, But part of them is error plaine, and voyde of wilful spight. This hope therefore remayneth yet, in time to get such grace, So shall my paynes procure reliefe, by force of chaunged place. Would to mee by shyning starre, which showes before the sonne, At rysing redde with horse let go, this message might be don. To his most familiar frende. Elegia. 6. Oure league of loue (O dearest frend) in firmest frendshippe knit, Thou will not nor, if happlye would, thou can dissemble it. To me so longe as lawfull was, none other stoode more deare, Nor any was in all that towne, wyth mee conioynd so neare. This loue amonge the people thicke, so openly was blowen, That almost more then thou or I, the same appeared knowen. And kindnes thine of gentle hart, vnto thy frend are prest, The man had throughly tryed whom, thou, dost loue aboue the rest. Nothing thou could so couert keepe, but I of counsaile was, And sondrye secretes beare in brest, in common not to pas. Thou onely wert the man from whom, no priuetye I hidde, (That one except alas) which me all vtterly vndidde. Which hadst thou wist thy fellow should, in sauegard thee haue serued, And shold (O frend) through thy aduise, from sauety neuer swerued. But me my destneis dire did draw, vnto this passing paine, They surely shut eche way to mee, that profite could containe. And whether I this mischiefe might, in being ware avoyde, Or els the way which destneys wil, by no meanes be destroyde. Yet thou to vs that fixed art, wyth long acquaintance fast, Welnere art greatest part I want, of all my pleasures past. Remember now if fauor can, thy power ought increase, To proue what it for me may do, we pray the neuer cease. That godhead once offended would, his anger somewhat staine. That place appointed chaunged eft, might partly ease my paine. That if with stunefull wickednes, my brest do not abound, And error be beginner of, my chiefe accusing found. My minde as his most hurtful wound, doth feare that filthy time, Thy griefe againe renueth eke, remembring of the crime. And what soeuer able is, me wyth such shame to spight, It should behoue it hidden were in darckesome closed night. Nought els therefore declare I will, saue onely sinnd I haue, But in such sin no riche reward, nor other gaine to craue. And this my fault men rightly may, and ought my follye name, If very names and true to things, they aptly seeke to frame. Which if they be not euen so, then looke the furthest cost, For my abode, let this land be, my subberbes vttermost. To his daughter. Eleg. 7. You wretten letters now prepare, the Harolds of my minde, To see Perhilla how she fares, wyth hast I haue assinde, You shall her finde, full sadlye set, fast by her mother sweete, Or els among her bookes alone, and learned muses meete. But when she knowes that thou art come, (all studyes set aside) What thinge I do she will demaunde, and in what state I bide. Then shalt thou say I liue although, not so as liue I would, Nor tract of time hath brought reliefe, as hope hath hopt it should. To muses yet (though hurt they haue) againe I do retyre, And verses eke of wrested words, to make I haue desyre. But tell me now? to studyes old, dost thou thy minde applye? To learned verse thy father like, wilt thou thy selfe affye? For nature with the frendly fates, hath geuen the maners chast, And sondry giftes but rarely seene, with wit good store thou hast. To Pegace pleasant springes, my selfe, of purpose brought the furst, Least that thy vaine of facound speache, might perishe els for thurst. In chastest yeares I noted well, the aptnes of thy braine, And as thy father did the gide, the way to learning plaine. Euen then I saye (but loue perhaps, wyth time is driuen away) A passing loue to thee I had, which hardly could decay. Wherefore if selfe same sparkes of wit, in the do still remayne, But onlye Sappoes learned workes, shall thine in skil distayne. And nowe I feare least my mishaps, might thee percase appall, Or through the same some dolenes may, within thy breast befall. While time did serue thy verse to mee, and myne to thee I redde, And now as Iudge I was, and now, as tutor I thee ledde. Or els sometimes wyth verses made, thine eares I did approue. Or finding fault: in blushing cheekes, the bloude sometimes did moue. Like me perchaunce for that my bookes, haue hindered me so sore, For feare of like mischaunce thou wil, thy studyes leaue therefore. Naye feare thou not Perhilla deare, this doubting dred remoue, So that no man of that thy verse, nor woman learne to loue. Set slouth therefore alwayes asyde (O thou most learned dame.) To sacred lore and Authors turne, let it not thee ashame. Thy fauor freshe wyth beuty fraught, shall fade in longer space, And wrinckled age shall then appeare, vppon thine elder face. When eluishe eld vppon thy shape, hath done her force and might, Who stil drawes neare wyth stelthye steps, to worke thy greuous spight. It wil the greue when some shal say, this wight she hath beene fayre, And loking in thy wonted glasse, for sorrow shalt despayre. Thou hast of wealth a metely minde, yet dost deserue much more, Enriche thy noble wit likewyse, with like abundaunt store. For fortune doth both geeue and take, and chaunge eche mans estate, And Hirus now he is become, that Cresus was but late. What needes more words? all mortall goodes, be lightly spent and gone, Saue those which in thy brest be hid, and minde except alone. Lo while of house and country both, and thee I was bereft, And of eche other thinge depriude, and naught at all was left. My wittes my mates they left, although, I did enioy them still, Of them no right could CÃ¦sar serue, whereby to worke his will. Eche man by force of cruell sword, my life may sone depriue, Yet shall my fame though I be dead, remaine alwayes aliue. While martiall Rome fr? mountaynes seuen, the conquered world behold, My learned workes shal stil be read, and fame for aye be told. And thou also that happyer vse, of studyes dost enioye, In what thou may flee hasting death, which earthly life destroye. He desyreth to see his frendes and countrye. Elegia. 8. Nowe would I wishe I might assende, on Triptolemus carte, Who first wyth seedes on earth to sow, hath taught the skilful arte, Now would I tame the monsters fell, the which Medea sad, Then flying from the lofty tower, of the Corinthea had. Nowe would I wishe to flye on highe, and flighty fethers take, The which thou Parseus whilom had, or Dedalus didst make. That flickering wysh these wighty wings, aloft in futill skye, I might forthwyth by meane thereof, my natiue ground espye. My sorry house and faithful frends, should so to sight appeare, And chiefely eke my louing wyfe, whom I accompt most deare. But why with childishe wishing words, thou fondlye these do craue? Which neuer thou before time had, nor yet shal after haue. But if thou wyshing prayers make, on CÃ¦sar them bestowe, Who is the mightye God in deede, thy selfe by proofe do knowe. He may to the these speedye wynges, and wheeled chariots lende, That wyth the flying foules thou maye, in thy returne contende. If these I aske (nor greater gifts) may none requyred bee, So shall my prayers seeme more large, then reason graunts to mee. In time to come perhaps, although, and anger all remoued, Wyth careful mind requyred then, to mercy be behoued. The whilst this smaller simple sute, I craue wyth humble hart, That from this land els where I may, by lycence free depart. The ayre foule and water could, my nature still doth hate, And land it selfe my bodye binds, in deepe diseased state. For eyther doth my troubled minde, the body fore molest, Or els the countrye breeds the griefe, where wyth it is distrest. So sone as I to Pontus came, wyth dreames I was agreeued, My flesh from boones it fled forthwyth, which meate hath not releeued. And loke what couler pale and wanne, vpon the leaues do showe, When winter frost beginneth first, and Borias blasts to blowe. Such old and wythered ceared hue, my members do pertake, Nor cause of loude complayning griefe, my painful minde forsake. Nor in more sound estate my minde, then body to remaine, But both at once diseased be, wyth fits of sickenes paine: Before my eyes me thinks I see, an Image stand in sight, Which representes my sickely shape, and minde wyth care affright. Such loue of death my brest assaults, my selfe by force to kill, Syth CÃ¦sar seeketh not wyth sworde, on mee to worke his wyll. And sith not force but gentle hate, thus long hath wrought our griefe, Through chaunged place God graunt we may, of him obtayne reliefe. VVhy Tomos was so called. Eleg. 9. Lo here some Gretian Cittyes be, (who would beleue the same?) And yet amonge the Nations rude, are knowen by barberous name. And to Myletus hither sent, the dwellers way did take, On Geta ground at last they stayed, and Grekishe hoisses make. Yea this towne eke thy fame more old, and elder terme is knowne, And of Absirtes cruell death, a proper name is growne. The sayling shippe through curious care, of martial Pallas wrought, At first these strugling streames assayde, before time neuer sought. The wicked wight Medea here, from father fleing fast, Her rowing owres vppon this coast, (men saye the first time cast.) The gazing stranger standing by, respecting seas by lowe, Discrying shippes aloofe, quoth he, (yen Colchean sayles I know) While shipmen there for dred did quake, and vp the cables cast, And while the anker vp to waye, their fearefull hands made hast. The giltye girle wyth cruell kuffe, did strike of Colchean brest, Whose hardy hand great hurt hath wrought, and vnto more is prest. And though wythin this maydens minde, highe courage did remayne, Much perfit palenes yet thereto, in face appeared playne. When hasting shippes wyth speedy pace, to drawe more neare she spyde, By craft we must my father flee, (we are betrayde) she cryde. Whyle she for counsell paused then, and loked round about, In sight at last her brother sawe, amids her deepest doubt, Whom when she spyde, forthwyth she sayd: I dare vs wel assure, My brothers death the cause shalbe, our safety to procure. He all vnwares and dreadinge nought, her cancred cruell spight, Into his syde her bloudy sword, she thrust with raging might. Her blade pluckt backe from gored syde, she rent wyth ruthful wound, And members macte in peeces small, she cast about the ground. And that her father might this knowe, on rocke whereby she past, His woful handes and bloudy head, wyth sleight she fixed fast. Wyth wayling new her aged syre, for this did make delay, And sobbing sore the fleshe toke vp, she safely scapte away. Hereof this towne is Tomos hight, for that vppon this soyle, The sister did her brothers corse, in sondry partes dispoyle. VVyth what Nations he liueth. Eleg. 10. If any there remember yet, mee Naso sent away, And in the Cittye voyde of mee, my name remayning stay. Know he in mids of barbarye, vnblisful man I breath, Where fixed starres do neuer stoupe, to subiect Seas beneath. The Savvromats a Nation fierce, the Bessians and the Geres, Which names vnworthye are my wit, adioyning haue their seates. Yet while the weather dureth warme, is Ister our defence, He wyth his liquid waters weete, repelles the battels hence. But when thunpleasant winter coms, puts out his vglye face, And all the lande be sprinckled white, to marble frost geeue place. While Borias blowes and while the snow, lyeth cast from Northren poole, Then is it plaine these people are, opprest wyth planet epole, The snow doth lye, which lyinge can, no Sunne or showers thowe, That frysing blast indurate makes, to shyning Christall growe. And on the first vnmelted yet, an other fals as fast, In diuers places wonted and, twise twelue monthes wholy last. So hideous force hath violent winde, from Northward hyther sent, The lofty Towers it equal layes, wyth ground and houses rent. Wyth mantles made of heary skinnes expell thy faruent could, And only of their bodyes all, their faces open hould. Their busshes oft wyth Isye drops, do make a tinkeling dinne, Their beards wyth frost be bright embrude, all hoary at their chinne. The cleared wynes in forme stand vp, like shards of chiuered tyle, Nor draughts the drincke but gladly wil, wyth goblets thrust begyle. What should I tel, yow riuers all wyth could congealed stand? And howe the britle waters be, cast vp wyth digging hand? The same up straighter then the streame, of Nylus bearing reede, Which parted into sondry gulfes, in vastye Seas do spreede. This Ister ties wyth parching blastes, his bluish liquor deepe, And forth in secret silent waues, to sea in couert creepe. Now may men safely walke on foote, where shippes late passage had, Wyth could concreate on waters knocke, the houed horses sad, And by such bridges newly built, on vnderslyding streame, Sarmatia oxen vnkouth waynes, draw forth wyth stretched teame. Forsoth I shall skant be beleeued, but if reward of lye, Be any there no witnes ought, that fayth to ratifye. The Largie freate with frost we saw, stand stil and neuer flowe, And slippery shell did vnder keepe, vnmoued surges lowe. Nor so contented to haue seene, the hardned seas we trode, When vpmost waues beneath my feete, not wetting them abode. If such a one sometime had beene, to the Liander kinde, In narrow seas no fault thy death, or cause of cryme could finde. Then neyther can the Dolphin fishe, in springing ayre attaine, Whom forcing fast aloft to skip, doth winter hard restraine. And though sir Borias blustering hurle, wyth winged wind displayed, No surging billow boulteth vp, from swallow surelye stayed. The piched pups inclosed sticke, in Marble as it were, No strugling owres through frosen floud, their course are able shere.</field>
