      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. Oh! wives and mothers! sons and brothers, And sisters of the dead! And daughters, too, and fathersâwho Will not be comforted; Still feeling o'er and o'er again, Yet warm, the last embraceâ Still seeing, though you saw not then, For tears, the parting face! Still dreaming, as you oft will dream, Your happy heroes home! Still waking, as you oft will wake, To know they will not come! Whether on Alma's banks they sleep, Or Balaklava's side, Or fell on Inkerman's dark steep, Or in the trenches died, Or, where the solemn Euxine waves Talk to each silent guest, Far, far down in the deep sea graves We may not visitârest, Or closed upon a patient bed, More gently-wearied eyesâ We bless, oh mourners of the dead, Your sacred sacrifice! We thank you sadly o'er and o'er, For all you could, you gaveâ We love you for the love you bore Your own and England's braveâ We drop upon their fun'ral pall One rain of England's tears! We sing one requiem for them all, And every nation hears! L. December, 1854. WAR'S MAGIC LANTERN. Who is this with that face we know, Yet only as one seen long ago, Or one that dreams, or pictures show, Now seenâlike a form that's multiplied By a thousand mirrorsâon every side? Who glides through our doorway, haunts our walk, Mutters into our sleeping ear, Gathers up all our free hearth-talk Into one theme austere; Where voices that once so lightly ran, Now like a stream that splits against stones, Break and then falter hoarsely on, With a heart's deep burden in their tones? Who at our church door stalks in, there Uplifting to God a stern new prayer? We see, yet but a reflexion still Of thee a Presence invisibleâ Thou who like unseen lightning dost strike, Who standing a Shade in the far horizon, Drawest away to thee, loadstone-like, To the foreign hills where the storm is rising, Half our nationâall our heartsâ We hear thee, we feel thee, the quick blood starts. Art thou not He whom in age calm and mellow, As his youth's fierce dream, the father names, Now come to be the playfellow Of his children's nursery-games? Yes, thou art WAR! the face of our land Thou hast changed with a pass of thy dreadful hand. A bugle note from the Danube criedâ And the banners of England were all flung wide, And down, down to the water side Troop after troop, each dazzling group, Filling the streets like a column of light, Marched in music out of sight. And the Queen in her balcony stood at the dawn, Weeping, and waving a farewell dear To her soldiers who went no more to return, Yet who gave her back a rapturous cheer. And those who stayed cried undismayed, âGo to glory, our chosen onesâ Fathers and brothers, husbands and sons!â Now homes are empty, and hollow eyes Are aching for what they find nowhereâ Our ripening vintage of youth swept off Elsewhere, elsewhere; While in our fields and in our streets Mourner with mourner meets. Thou bringest together, Wizard War! Sights and sounds whole seas apart; The crack of a rifle from afar Rings death into our heart; Far off a soldier in his death dream Looks on the home that loves him well; From that home a voice cries over the deep, âFarewell!â and again âFarewell!â Now through our islands a craving silence Asks the news that comes first in a whisper, a hush, Then in a storm-swift, sudden rush Of battle stories, of dismal glories, Out of whose surges often emerges A bleeding limb, or a grim pale head, Or the one name is caught, and 'tis that of the dead! Then comes a storm, as when chords we strike, Clashing out triumph and anguish alike. High and low together flow, Mingled by the mingling blood Epaulette, and rank and file Shed in brother-herohood. Stripling noble, peasant's son, With one pulse your true veins bound, Bravely, bravely both have done, And in both one race is crowned. Peeress mother, labouring father, Hearts that once no bond allied, Meet in terror, meet in pain, Meet in pity and in pride. For from soft and snowy pillow, And from coarse flock bed is one, One deep cry sent to the sky, âSave, oh God! my son!â Whence comest thou, strange Innovator, Democrat, Anarchist, who hast made Troubled and hot as a seething crater The calmest isle in sea-cradle laid? Whence art thou? There is a palace can tellâ 'Tis not a phosphor-lit hall of Hell, Where on the doomed by the naphtha lake The god-fiend scowls from his burning crown; But polished and white, in the sun's free light, Where on smiling courtiers a prince smiles down. From the deeps of that despot's purple heart, Did the dragon-dream full wingÃ«d start. O'er Russia's wide wastes the storm-herald hastes, Their myriad slaves to the field to drive; Gloomily arming, All came swarming Like bees from their savage boundless hive. From the cold shining granite of palaces That glare through the sunny city of ice, In his furs came the noble haughtily clad, The serf in his sheepskin hungry and sad, From his hut that arose a blot in the snows; Like a pack of well-trained, well-starved hounds, Down came the drove from all Russia's bounds. But there in the Tauric land Ashore stepped another band, From Europe's prime realm, in power and grace, From the sea's isle-Queen so safe in its place, The small and the strong, They came on the wave that kissed like a slave The keels of that war-freighted throng. Yes, there the fleets of England and France, The swan-queens of the sea, advance; Their necks arched for conquest in scornful beauty They bend to the foe with proud saluteâ So, gracefully pay their haughty duty, Then float to the triumph none dare dispute. There came the Britons, the lions of war, Massive, majestic, in form and in mind, Like powers of nature, strong workers by law, Vassals to duty, else kings of their kind. And France sent her sons, The chivalric ones, All fire in the fight, all laughter in death, Whose blood bounds a war-dance, who waste life like breath, For the payment of glory, their passionate faith. They came, in flame-letters, to write on War's page, How England and France in jubilant scorn, Flung down to Russia their gage On Alma's wild morn. They took up their ground, each steadfast troop, Led by those plumes, the snow-wreaths of war, Soon to be crimsoned, but never to droop, The soldier's idol, the Muscovite's awe. On, splendid warriors! Fame hangs in the air, To watch what you do, to cheer what you dare. Like the wolves their brothers, wild sons of wild mothers, To the field trooped the gray men in swarms, They raved and they wrangled, they tore and they mangled In hordes that bade scorn to our arms. But the sun looked sadly ere he set, On hills of those savage slain, Like wild beasts with jaws all red and wet, And their fierce teeth fixed in the plain. Oh, the glory of battle! When the loud sharp rattle Of rifles out-volleying all in one, Makes glaring blanks in the close welded ranks, Whence dead with a cry drops man after man. Oh, the bayonet's dash! With its dark red splash, When, though hosts stand like granite, the granite is cleft! And the sabre charge where right and left The sword lightning flies, and a foeman dies At each rapid twist of the trooper's wrist, When he fights hemmed in by circling bandsâ Close walls all alive with points of steel, Like death darting out a hundred hands; Yet out of that live solid mass of strife He hews his way back into life. Oh, rapture of warfare! and canst thou not last? Look again, England, dare not recoilâ Now houseless before the winter blast, Half naked in snows and starved amidst toil, A skeleton band In the frozen land, With sickening eyes looks for the morn Whence Victory and Vengeance shall spring twinborn. Ay, their hearts fail not, and we will quail not, O War! for thy price we know; With a solemn cheer we have welcomed thee here, And we do not bid thee go. We are strong, though trouble like a knife Has searched our strength to the root of its life; Though now stand our statesmen, nerved to bear In pale, unmurmuring despair, Pierced in hand, in heart, in brain, By the bitter missiles the slingers rainâ While the people's heart boils up, leaps forth, From a cry of pain to a cry of wrath, Asking account of their loved, their slainâ O people be patient! they die not in vain. If, seers who the shine, not the shadow, saw, With too much hope and too little awe, And vain of the splendour poured from our coasts, We launched our ships and we armed our hosts With blessings too proudly swelled to boasts; If we counted but half of the price to pay, All the drain of our heart's best gold, The long death in life so sadly told, That we die almost in the listeningâyea, If at that altar of sombre pomp, Our prayers took too bold a breath, Not now will we falter, not now at that altar Unswear a whole nation's faith; Nor stir the bed where our champions bled, To take the crown from their death; Nor call from the field they never will yield The brothers of those who fell; Nor waste on a few vain battle flashes The passion evoked like a spell; Noâwe are pledged to thy very ashes, Thou fortress gate of Hell! The soldier outworn, lying cold in the morn, Whom life in the trenches left, Dies with his eyes on those blank white walls, Dreams of the passage by blazing balls For the rushing Vengeance cleft, And he sighs for all that glory foregone, Yet he dooms those walls ere his breath be flown. In Scutari's chambers of prostrate strength, The moaning raver of the night, Fancying the assault, drinks up at length That cup of burning delight. And the spirits who, gloomy man by man, Went out from our banished troop, Through the silent gates where no foeman waitsâ There still walks the ghostly group. They linger yet on the blood-red strand, They float not o'er to the cherished land, Where nightly the living and loving yearn For a dream of the phantom exile's return. They wait till they hear o'er their rocky graves Another dirge than that of the waves, Till those anthems of cannon music roll O'er the ashes of Sebastopol. Till Russia, into our sovereign hands From her nerveless grasp letting fall The keys of the seas and the fettered lands, Her conquering creditor pay for all. And you who weep in England and France O'er a name in the blood-bright list, Oh think that the spirits of the dead Your souls with brave lips have kissed; And with eyes made calm by a noble grief, Look to their comrades for its relief. âWar on! till under your hands arise A dome of Peace to the storm-freed skies, Wherein may Freedom find ample room For her eagles' stately sweep; And be that rainbow-like, heaven-wide dome, An arch of triumph to vault the tomb That covers our heroes' sleep.â A. February 7, 1855. WAR MUSIC. The merest soldier is to-day The poet of his art, Though he should neither sing nor say The transports of his heart. His genius writes in words of steel, And utters them in thunderâ Whilst we want speech for what we feel, Who sit at home and wonder. And those whom England with a cry Saw dashed into the strife, Those men of ours who rode to die, Like men who ride for lifeâ Whose souls, ere well the word had gone, Into the smoke were hurled, Who bound on bound went charging on Into another world, (No lover nobler frenzy knew, Nor âsighedâ a âtruer breath,â Than theirs who with loose bridles flew Into the arms of death.) Doubt not, I say, the hearts of all A grander music made, When dancing to that funeral, Than ever clarion played. And music in our hearts at home Re-echoes, as we read, The rapturous harmonies that come From an immortal deed. L. November, 1854. âWHEN SHE WENT FORTH.â When she went forth, in hope serene, Her country's banner o'er her, Whilst all our hearts that crowned her queen Strewed prayers like flowers before herâ When she went forth, who three times blest, No longer reads and hears, But laying down the dumb death-list, Gives help instead of tearsâ She, champion of her country's cause, As faithful and as brave, As he who sword in battle draws Before an open graveâ E'en she, who bleeding at her feet Sees many a hero laid, Whose task, though terrible as sweet, Has found her not afraidâ She on the altar of whose heart God kindled long ago That fire which moved her to depart When England bade her goâ We blessed the ship that carried her, For it was England's dove, Rejoicing on its wing to bear All England's soul of love. L. November, 1854. THE BEARER OF THE FATAL ORDER. âOh! is this not the most glorious Life that ever man could lead?ââ Throbbing from a day victorious, Burning for what should succeed, Met not then the storm-dark morrow, With its lightning charge thine eyesâ Useless glory, bitter sorrow, From a frantic sacrifice? Like a shot the word was flung, Short and sharp, from Chief to Chief, And the squadron forward sprung, But thy triumph-trance was brief. Hill and plain one sheet of foes, Gaily fliest thou to th' attackâ Victim ere the sabres close, Only thy swift steed comes back! Instant came the bounding bullet, Tearing out a dying scream, Plunging in thy heart to cool it, 'Midst the mad flames of its dream. Fatal messenger! first corse Flung upon those funeral plains, Covered soon with England's loss, Yet how rich in Glory's gains! Gazing on those doomed Hussars, Going full speed to their tombs, See we not their souls like stars, Lighting up Death's boundless glooms? A. March 5, 1855. INKERMAN. Murderous morn, whose dawn was lost in cloud! Drizzling rain, soon mixed with death's red dew! Mound of doom, of which our tears are proud! English hearts to desperate duty true! Inkerman! by all these martyrs' fall Made the word of wonder that thou art!â England, tear-stained Priestess, vows you all To a fame stern, solemn, and apart. Hot with hatred, raving mad with wine, Drunk from wicked vows, o'er the dark land, Up the hill, swarmed Russian line on lineâ But they met there that serene, stern band. And the hideous, blindfold, stabbing fight, (Death by bayonets dashed to and fro) Struggled on, with but the hell-fire light Shot and shell upon their murders throw. Darkly hewed from hundreds down to scores, Firm our Guardsmen hold their hill of woesâ Round Death's brave despair, unheeded roars Still in huger waves that sea of foes. But the Frenchâoh, loyal hearts well done!â Breathless with fierce joy to share our fate, In they rush and onward, all in one, Cheering, charging, gloriously elate! Oh ye Hours! on blood-clogged wheels, at last, Roll away the dismal, splendid day! And the flight of souls, by cannon-blast Chased all day through Death's wide gateway, stay! All is over!âDare we ask who fell? Noble name on name comes thick and fastâ Till sobs choke the voice that tries to tell All it cost us to prevail at last. Many a veteran, sealing a life's truth, In his last, his best there offered upâ Many a gentle, happy soldier youth Drained his first, last draught from War's wine-cup. To his eyes dream-dazzled seemed the strife, But a game played gaily by the brave; All the boy-heart panting with new life, Rushed through the war-riot to the grave. French and English, let them heart by heart, Deathmates tried and true, as brothers lie! Weep as friends, together though apart, You whose homes your heroes left to die! A. November 28, 1854. TO J. H. CLUTTERBUCK. Young standard-bearer! whom, with mournful pride, Wearing henceforward on her heart thy name, England now welcomes to her lists of fameâ Oh! to sublimest manhood glorified, How my heart sees thee on the wild hill-side, Like war's bright angel in the furious game, Waving those colours high o'er steel and flame, Cheering the brave to death, and dying as they died! At home that day what millions knelt in prayer! The far-off thunder drowned not the church bell, And they who loved thee were all kneeling there, Nor knew the moment when their hero fellâ Beauteous and brave, brave as the bravest were, And mourned more bitterly than words can tell. L. December, 1854. THE BRITISH SOLDIER. I. We know our soldierârecognise In him the land whose huts and towers, Whose social freedom, household ties, Alone could train such men as ours. The Chief who spurred his charger forth, Soon as the dreadful message came, The followers sweeping on his path, Into the heart of sword and flame; The beauteous boy in his first fight, While his young voice cheered on his band Into the death-shots' thickest flight, Falling, his colours in his hand; The soldier, who with man's devotion, Fought by his dear young leader's side, And who, with woman's soft emotion, Buried and blest him where he died; Nor less than those made great by death, The great by what they live to bear, Who bravely yet draw painful breath, Strong to sustain, as quick to dare. These are the men of England, these The men who left sweet homes, who sleep On Tartar-hills, by far wild seasâ The men we loved, the men we weep. And these are they for whom in turn Their homes our Englishwomen leave, True sisters of the brave, to earn Blessings 'tis glory to receive. They wait those ships that touch the beach, Fast emptying out the ghastly shoals Of their live freightâthey welcome each With the strong love of seraph-souls. And Light on those strange Eastern walls, Where the nurse glides through pain's pale ranks, From her bright eyes of pity falls, And shines in their dim eyes of thanks. II. Oh British Soldier! 'mid thy feats Of wonder, still show what thou artâ That in thine iron frame yet beats Thy mother's and thy sister's heart. We saw thee on those fields of woe, With a calm fierceness worse than hate, In the death-grapple hold thy foe, With the relentless arms of fate. Then fresh from thine all-bloody part, Thou, when the battle-wrath was over, Wert tender as a woman's heart That breaks for pity o'er a lover. That mangled wretch, slave born and bred, Half brute by nature, fiend by training, Who wolf-like fought, and tore the dead, Or stabbed out all the life remainingâ To tears is his rude heart surprised, For never priest had taught the slave That, nursed in freedom, schooled by Christ, None are so gentle as the brave. God bless you, soldiers of our land! Still make yourselves more proudly dear To us, whose loving eyes are chained By the stern charms of your career. God bless you! though a blood-red name Mark each strange spot that saw you fall, England, enamoured of your fame, Hath set her broad, bright seal on all. God bless you, champions of all lands! The world, that will be slave no more, Hath given her cause into your hands, Your hands that are both strong and pure. A. December 10, 1854. TO A FRENCH GENERAL. Gentle, generous, and brave heart! I may call thee so, Though I know not who thou art, And shall never know. In a rapture of amaze, O'er a tale so sweet, All my soul its homage pays, Kneeling at thy feet. Like a warrior-saint of old, With transcendant might, As past legends oft have told, Flashing on the fightâ To our soldier on the ground, Bleeding and in danger, Came with swift approaching sound The majestic stranger. Bending down to him thou saws't, Singly, matched by five, Thou didst snatch him on thy horse From the field alive. Soldier of our own the one, A French chief the other, Each when the brave deed was done Recognised a brother. And a truer brotherhood Could not words express, Than the kiss, thy head was bowed On his hand to press. Vanishing with lightning speed, As thou first didst comeâ Who shall tell us if thy steed Brought its master home? Oh, but if thy life be charmed From the ceaseless ball, Evermore to ride unharmed Where thy brethren fall, Happy might the loveliest be Of our English land, To repay that kiss to thee On thy hero-hand. L. December, 1854. THE MAIDEN AT HOME. Fast, fast I pace the long, green walk, I wander wide and far; The woods are full of phantom talk, And all their speech is war. Will quiet never come again? Must night, that softly came In fragrant dusk erewhile, now reign A dream of blood and flameâ Where armed men who kill and die, Swords dashing blow on blow, Outcries of death or victory, Are clashing to and fro? As though some Voice from high had blown This fair, still world away, By fortress-walls or hills unknown, Like a lost ghost I stray. And for the sigh from tree to tree That dreaming summer bore, The Euxine plashes heavily Upon a rocky shore. He who last summer pressed my hand With such a long farewell, Now fights in yonder murderous landâ Last night perhaps he fell. He smiled adieuâbut that pale smile Made sterner still his face; Words passed, but on our lips the while Love dared not find a place. How could I so my heart have tasked? Oh, should not such an hour Have under lifeless looks unmasked A spirit of love and power? I felt he loved me, and I knew He went perhaps to dieâ Yet dared I not to truth be true, Nor breathe an honest sigh. Now daily with heroic scorn He gazes in Death's face, Hears nought but thunders cannon-born, Round that war-girdled place; Or, singly flung amongst his foes, Now bears the banner high, Round which the struggling thousands close, Nor yields it but to die; Braves in the trench the burning breath Of the ball that seeks him out, Or charms his band to rush on death, With his clear rallying shout. Oh! fancy pictures not amiss That shapes a hero so; These records tell how brave he is, How gentle, well I know. I know that sinking comrades feel His cheer like life's warm ray; I know that foemen bless his steel That spares where spare it may. In stories of heroic deeds His name is never missed; I kiss the word my dim eye reads In the immortal list. When trumpets stir his heart's brave blood To a fierce dance of glee, As one who guards him for his good Does he e'er dream of me? Laid in cold sleep 'mid nightwinds wintry, Looks in no tender face To turn that tent where Death stands sentry, Into a blessed place? Oh! these dull limits to enlarge, This blank with life to fill! Oh! to have been in that grand charge Up Alma's deadly hill! See, step by step, how firm and slow Those peerless men march on! Through showers of death unmoved they go, And the dreadful heights are won! Love whirls me with an eager pain Into the battle blastâ Oh! for an angel's wing to gain And hold my hero fast! Still must dumb frozen distance prove The blank 'twixt him and me? I will be with thee, oh! my love, Whate'er thy fate may be. Wilt thou return with a hero's name, Or wear it in the grave? Or lie, our grateful care to claim, With thy country's bleeding brave? Oh, trebly by those wounds endeared!â To feel, all flowing o'er, A mother's heart towards one half feared For manhood's pride before; While each soft word swells from the heart, Each look is softer stillâ Be this but mine! my future part Is happy, come what will; Calmed by the farewell of a soul So royal still in death, Or making life a blessed whole Clasped in his love and faith! A. December 31, 1854. A VOTE OF THANKS. Clasping hands from your two lands, Twins in fame and death! Both your names one love proclaims, In one ardent breath. Different races, different faces, Different speechesâwhat ye've done At th' appeal of one pure zeal, Melts them all to one! Noble blows, as fervent foes, Once ye dealt each otherâ Nobler far the death-strokes are, Brother shares with brother. Face to face, ye showed the world, Once what men could doâ Side by side, your flags unfurled, Now your past deeds all outdo. To our sideâwhen heroes died, Crushed by masses, seven to oneâ All on flame our brothers came, And the day was won! Then the cheer Earth ne'er did hear, Save where fate bids die or win, From our ranks pealed England's thanks, As they bounded in. To the brave the hail we gave In that glorious cry, Like the rapture of despair, Went up to the sky. Men of England! Men of France! The sad glories of the field, With your blood, your brotherhood To all time have sealed. O'er the bed of England's dead France's tears have runâ England's praise fond homage pays To the deeds that France has done. A. December, 1854. CHRISTMAS TIDE. Startled oft from slumbers brief, Listening for the far-off guns, Drunk with glory and with grief, England counts her slaughtered sons. By a thousand Christmas fires Sits a soldier's ghost to-dayâ Many a soldier's soul expires Whilst we revel far away. From the dancers, many a maiden Draws away her hand in tearsâ Many an orange chaplet hidden In black raiment, disappears. Thundering in the Crystal dome, Battle-music shakes the wallsâ And the broken hearts at home Follow phantom funerals. What though five barbarians fall For each man of ours that dies, Still we are not paid for all, And we claim a costlier prize. To build Truth a nobler throneâ To give Freedom wider airâ This is why we cheered them on, This is why their graves are there. This is why we still defy, Czar! the bayonets of slavesâ And 'tis God's own victory Rises grandly from our graves. L. December, 1854. NEW YEAR'S DAY. Smiling sternly through her tears, Comes the first day of the year; Like the last, aloft she bears Banners to two nations dear. There the red cross of our land, There the rainbow colours flyâ Passed by Death from hand to hand, How they swept to victory! England greets thee, France, to-day, Eager, for the year that's past, From her heart of hearts to pay, With a warm embrace at last. By brave deeds and noble words, Taught to charm old hates to restâ France and England! be the swords You have drawn together, blest! L. January 3, 1855. TO OUR ARMY. England's Forlorn Hope, think not your dark days Wear on, unwatched, forgot! Noâthe whole world is empty, to her gaze, Of all but that one spot. When creaming, steaming, Euxine billows leaped, And tore in their white wrath The ship with all our best and choicest heaped For that bare nook of earth, Oh, then all England wailed, as though her life Were in that sea-sunk freight, When the wind-curdled waters in their strife Moaned out, âToo late, too late!â Upon your couch of rain-soaked clay there falls No chill but stabs us through; No wind hath torn to strips your canvas walls, But England felt it too. She kneels beside the bed that sees the war Of patient strength with death; She stretches out clasped hands of prayer from far, To help your struggling breath. Oh well, when once you're home, we'll tend you yet, Our brave and dear defenders! Kind hands, mute looks, choked thanks, shall own the debt That Love to Valour renders. The air shall tremble round you in the street With blessings everywhere; Sacred in each sad home is kept your seat, More sacred when you're there. We on your hearts that star shall worship, lit Amid the dark of war; We know the touch of Glory kindled itâ 'Tis England's signet-star. Like divine fragments shall the limbs be prized Maimed in our victories, The noble forms your souls so sacrificed, Be holy in our eyes. Dim with their gaze on your brave wounds shall grow The laughing eyes of girls, And on your tales of war and all its woe, Their tears be strung like pearls. When of dear friends and noble deaths you tell, Those dancing hearts shall move As to slow musicâthen for you shall swell With a full sister's love! A. January 27, 1855. WORDS TO THE CZAR. Since first the Sultan's wrong and wrath Called up the West against the North, Since two majestic champions there Rose, and to Russia said, âForbear!â Oh, Czar! each stately onward stride In our stern path, had God for guide. When Moslems thronged with wondering din To see the two fair fleets sail in, See in the Golden Waters ride The beauteous rivals side by side, With snow-white sister-wings unfurled, To guard the quiet of the world; When Varna's hot and hateful fen Killed week by week our noblest men, Where sickening night and glaring day Turned youth and valour into clay; In rest, in pest, by swamp, by sea, We knew the triumphs yet to be. When all our ships had overflowed Those shores of thine with their brave load, (Lo, all of them Hope's chosen knights, The double-bannered host alights!) Shot not a warning through the air, That righteous vengeance landed there? When the immortal march moved on, When Alma's heights were braved and won, When round the towers our vengeance claims, Death cleared the lists for desperate gamesâ Deeds that took wonder's breath away! Men who seized glory as a prey! When every step of that great race Caught laurels from each dreary place, Where panting flew the warrior swarms Into each other's bloody arms, And dropped pale corpses from that holdâ Was Hope, our prophet, then too bold? Her flying chariot fate has sped From field to field, from dead to dead; And now her redhot wheels she stays 'Twixt past and future battle-days. Oh, Czar! in this our breathing-space, We look into thy guilty face. Though with a thousand graves Earth parts Their darlings from a thousand hearts; Though those with strength for suffering curst In bitter patience bear the worst; For all, the end is yet to beâ Ask, if thou darst, what end for thee? A. January 8, 1855. THE GHOSTS AND THE CZAR. âLo! we stand around thy pillow, Czar! We are those who died! English, French, and Russians, here we are, Waiting at thy side! Lo! the comrades of the Camp and Sea, From the brother-lands! With our ghostly swords we come to thee, In our blood-red hands! Count our famous Colours one by one! Count us man by man! Lance and rifle, bayonet, sword, and gun! Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman! England counts us too with all her voicesâ And France holds us dear! Hark how Glory o'er our names rejoices With her loudest cheer! See these stains from the barbarian veins Of thy drunken hosts! With their bodies swarm three battle plains And the air with ghosts! See these poor love-tokens which thy dead Held in cold embracesâ Letters love has writ, and love has readâ Portraits of sweet faces. Oh! we pitied them when we had slain them! Be their blood on thee! But 'twas God that sent us to unchain them, For the Dead are free!â âYes, the Dead are free, and here are we; Round thy bed we gatherâ We, the wretched ones, once call'd thy sons, Come to curse their father. Crowding home the bodiless are come, From thy wicked wars! Noble and slave, we rolled into one grave, In a cursed cause! We will lick no longer, with false faces, Dust from off thy floor! And the foot that stamped us all to pieces, We will kiss no more! Now no more of lying, nor of spyingâ 'Twas a toilsome trade! How we cheated, kissed the cheeks we hated, Wheedled and betrayed! Now no pale Siberia as we walk In the crowded places, Drops a sudden silence on our talk, Horror on our faces!â On the day when first we faced our foes, How their grand war-cry All the slave-blood in our bosoms froze, Ere we turned to fly. Yet upbraid us not, for well we fought On that furious day, When thy young sons there, mad as despair, Lashed us to the fray! Trampled, pierced, and shattered, thirsting, groaning, As we lay and died, Still we fired on the red soldier, moaning Faintly at our side. When the conquerors came to seek and save us, Still we fired and slew, And full often from the cup they gave us Drank their life-blood tooâ But the morning breaks! the world awakes! Let the Living come Bells to ring, and loud Te Deums sing, When the Dead are dumb.â L. January 8, 1855. THE BRAVE WHO HAVE NOT BLED. What though our hearts are busy weaving wreaths For all the battle's dead, Think not that we forget the sacred deaths Of those who have not bled Beside their death-beds sit our souls in tearsâ We watch them to their tombsâ We count the years lost in their sepulchres To England and their homes. All that they did, and all they would have done, We fondly hear and tellâ Soldier and brave physician, one by one We bid them all farewell! L. January 9, 1855. THE GOOD PHYSICIAN. [The name of Dr. Thomson, Assistant-Surgeon of the 44th Regiment, is well known. Of his soldier-servant and fellow-worker, a letter to the Times says:ââHe is, I believe, still living. I have heard his name mentioned in terms of the greatest gratitude and admiration by the whole army in the Crimea, as John M'Grath, but have never heard of his having as yet received any reward for his noble devotion in the cause of humanity.â âExtract from a letter signed, âAn Officer who was on the spot.â] Thou God's true soldier! take thy place with those Fall'n children of renown! No swordsman fighting off a crowd of foes, Toiled for a braver crown Than thou, meek Duty's knight, who on thine arms lay'st down. Lo! Alma's bloody battle-banquet o'er, And the red revel left In wasteful fragments and spilt cups of gore, Vessels of life bereft, And the half dead with limbs by British bayonets cleft. Hatred, and Wrath, and Death have had their day, Their sickles swept the plains, Now comes thine hourâ'tis thine the last to stay And glean with tender pains The scattered fruit of Life, spared from their ghastly gains. Thou seest thy comrades all stride past thee, plumed With victory, to new fightsâ Silent, as by past carnage still engloomed, Watch round those shadowy heights; Cossacks behind the hush swooping for prey like kites. Round thee a dead and dying company!â There find'st thou thy last place, Amid those yet armed savages who lie With dark distrustful face, And looks that long to smite that Friend of hated race. All day from Death's dumb heaps dost thou untomb Life that but breathes in sighs, Amongst departing souls, through night's long gloom, Move thy true ministries, Where none sleep save the dead, and wide wake danger's eyes. But for one faithful helper, all alone!â Those five days counted o'er Three hundred rescued livesâand then thine own, Strained to its task no more, Went from that prostrate crowd laid out on Earth's stained floor. âFarewell and greeting, follower of the Best Physician, Friend to man!â Breathed from dim eyes on earth or souls at rest, Whose new life just beganâ âGo from our hearts to God's, thou good Samaritan!â A February 24, 1855. SEBASTOPOL. Sad Hope, who watching, o'er the waves, That fortress on the cruel shore, Seest all around it graves on graves Of those who once thy standard bore, Hear'st tender groan or piercing taunt, O'er those brave Outcasts struggling thereâ Till faint and fainter grows thy chant, More and more like thy sigh, Despair! Oh! look again, pale Hope, for time Ripens to fruit thy soul's dear aim; That darling of Imperial crime, That stronghold of all Europe's shameâ Though still our war's prolonged endeavour, She scorns with rampart, shell, and ball, We know she cannot stand for ever, Since France and England swore her fall. New life leaps daily on her coasts, The trenches yawn, the guns advance, A fire is in your hearts, oh! hosts, That fight for England and for France! Feels she the stealing flame that waits Her bulwark? Sees she how the foe So fiercely trembling at her gates, Counts the long hours to lay her lowâ When eyes that wept those noblest dead, With a stern joy that God inspires, Shall see, like funeral torches spread, The blazing of those winter fires? For, from the ruins of that pile, On which our hearts so long have broken, Shall Europe's war-stained Freedom smile, And the world's solemn thanks be spoken. A. January 8, 1855. VISIONS. I. Mother! in whose ears, by night and day, Furious horsehoofs down a valley sound, Bursting like a thunderbolt away From thy boy left groaning on the ground! He, one moment past, Proud to rush so fast On the ball which met him at mid bound! Yes, oh mother! whosoe'er thou be, Straining back, through soft October's sun, All thy soul between two hills to see Where those riderless war-horses run, And their shining, shattered Riders all lie scatteredâ And to hasten through them, seeking for that one! Hang not o'er that vision on the sward With an agony too sore to bear! God hath saved for thee one farewell word, And one lock of thy slain darling's hair! Though, in that strange hour, Pain had crushing power, Love's unshattered heart preserved thine image there. Simple words were those his dying breath Bravely uttered betwixt groan and groan, Whilst his comrade on the road to death Bent to catch the message and be goneâ Let none say they claim Neither praise nor fame! God hath heard and blest them, looking on! II. Thou, too, hearing in repeated trance One that softly calls from a tent door, Calleth in the kindly speech of France, âHere he liesâand he will wake no more! Ere, on the white ground, Him at dawn we found, Death had found him, and we brought him to this floor.â Well thou know'st the face to them unknown, Laid out there in uncomplaining calm! With thy piercing cry, âHe died alone! Frozen, whilst this hearth was blazing warm!â Thou, for whose great anguish Fancy finds a language, Dream a softer dream o'er that poor form! Stealing through the wild, white gloom like hope, Sleep caressed away his painful breath, And his soul glid smoothly down a slope Of delicious visions into death, And, with murmurs dim, Voices talked of him, As we talk by beds where fever languisheth. All the grim war-landscape of the waste Melted from those heavy, happy eyesâ Tent, and trench, and battery displaced Slowly, for a fire-lit room to rise, In whose curtained shade All his children played, And Death found his soul with thee in Paradise. III. âDoctor, quick! I'm for the front again! What's the loss of a left arm, I say? Oh, I've seen our best and stoutest men Trampled into muddy, bloody clay!â Stones must serve our turn nowâ Let the villains learn how England's Guards can keep their ground to-day!â âForward! forward! down the General goes! Would to God my breast had turned that ball! On them with the bayonet! charge and close! Snatch those Colours e'er the brave boy fall! Snatch them yet another! Oh my own last brother! Now the turn is mine to save them for you all!â âHark, it is our own brave Duke that speaks, Come to count his battered Guardsmen o'er! Look, the tears are running down his cheeksâ âNever did I think to see you more! No, my gallant fellows, You, nor yet these Colours! Never have they gone through such a day before!ââ âFather! father! long e'er this I know You have pardoned your rebellious sonâ You must live until I come to show Clasp and medal from my country won! One for Alma, father, One for Balaclava, One for Inkerman, to tell you what I've done!â âWhere's the tress she gave me when we parted, Cut in haste from her fair lengths of hairâ When I thought she looked so broken-hearted, I had won it ere we were aware? Oh, our dance that night! Anguish and Delight, Love and Farewell, were the partners there.â âOh my cruel love! I thought of you, In the roar and rattle of the strife, And my heart was to its grief as true, With a sword's point half an inch from life, Or, when called to wait In yon trench for fate, As when you refused to be my wife!â Raving thus in the hushed blank of night, Still as fever lifts its weary head, There is one who glides with watchful light Down the endless floor from bed to bed, And the dream-vexed spirit Feels a blessing near it, In her robe's light stir, and in her foot's light tread. There is one who daily, nightly, too, âThinks of her beloved troopsâ afar, One who from her palace blesses you, Patient martyrs of a noble war! All our hearts, no less, Reverently confess What you've done for us, and what you are! L. February, 1855. THE BANQUET. Come the maimed, the halt, the blind, Welcome to a royal feast! 'Tis the banquet that mankind Gives to those it loves the best. Banquet of no giddy revel! 'Tis the solemn joy that pays To the Conquerors of Evil Immortalities of praise. Hail you guests no longer living! Silently we keep your place; Rank no vain distinction giving, Welcome all the laurelled race! Leader to the pit of death, Follower with a step as free, Bounding back with throbbing breathâ Bring your wreaths for us to see! Weary with triumphant toil, Come with wounds, or rise from graves! All in rich attireâthe spoil Seized in War's dark treasure caves. On your hearts that leapt toward danger Glory lights her flaming star, Blood-red marvel to the stranger, England's seal to times afar. Each who poured his blood like wine, Gave his body for a prey, Battle's wreck, yet Glory's shrine, Be his country's guest to-day! A. March 3, 1855. FLOWERS IN THE CRIMEA. âThe tents are turned to gardensââsweet spring flowers Like children gaze for the first time on death; They start in smiling wonder from beneath The thunderbolts stored up by warring Powers; They crowd the mounds where sleep those Fallen of ours, Like fairies, to embalm in innocent breath Free hearts whose martyred valour covereth With alien splendour yon tyrannic towers. Can sweetness mingle thus with groans and wrath? Oh, if the gardener, Nature, comes so quick To smooth the horrors on Destruction's path, Will not soft consolations bloom as thick At home, amongst the ruins of each life Whose all was risked and lost in its own England's strife? L. March 19, 1855. TO THE CZAR. We look round for thee, and thou art not there!â With thy last breath, oh thou great Enemy! We miss a dreadful glory from the sky, And, in a half remorse, stand lingering where Death led thee from us down his secret stair, Baffled and silent, into vacancy; Thenâas one lays a thrilling story byâ Turn back regretful to the common air. The grand poetic wrath has left the strifeâ The glorious hate, which fed our hearts with fire, Like a first love has vanished from our life, To send the soul out for a new desireâ No more the passionate triumph of an hour, But the grave victory of world-redeeming power. L. March 5, 1855. THE END.</field>
