      <field name="fulltext">Quantum flevi in Hymnis &amp; Canticis suavè sonantis Ecclesiæ tuæ voces illæ influebant auribus meis, &amp;c. How sweetly have I wept in Hymns and Songs! At the sounding of thy Church, the Voices flew into mine Ear, and thy Truth melted into mine Heart; and from thence flew forth the effects of Godliness; the Tears ran down mine Eyes, and it was well with me when I was with them. August in his Preface to the Psalms cap. 6.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth The Glory and excellent Perfections of GOD the FATHER. THE INTRODUCTION. All praise be given to the Lord, Who condescends so low, For to unfold deep things to us, By things which we do know. Lord give us more Knowledge divine, Thy Word Explain to us, That we may find those things of thine To be indeed precious. Pour forth thy Spirit on us, Lord, Deep Mysteries to know, That we may find Grace in our Souls, And in it also grow: And by it may be help'd alwayes Thy Praises to sing forth, And live also unto thy praise Whilst we are on the Earth. HYMN 1. [A Father doth his Child beget] Math. 5. 16. Glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. [The First Part.] A Father doth his Child beget, So we begotten are, By thy own Word and Spirit Lord, And do thine Image bear. He likewise doth his Children cloath, And doth them also love; So thou most richly cloaths all such That are born from above. A Father feeds and does protect Such who his Children be: So thou dost feed and save all those Who do belong to thee. And also doth delight in them Who him resemble do: To such who are most like to thee, Thou dost chief favour show. Second Part. A Father loves his Children should All live in Unity; So thou delights to see thy Saints Walk in sweet Harmony. He ever does o'relook the faults, Which he in them does spy: So all thy People's faults likewise Thou dost, O Lord, pass by. 'Tis a high honour to descend From such who Noble be; Kings Children are all but base born, To those, Lord, born of thee. Rich Parents may soon poor be made, And also they do die: Thou Lord art rich, and so wilt be Unto Eternity. All praise and glory unto God Our Father, be therefore: And unto Christ that ransom'd us, Be Praise for evermore. HYMN 2. [A Portion Lord thou didst design] Psal. 73. 26. God the Portion of his People. [The First Part.] A Portion Lord thou didst design On thine for to bestow; Nought didst thou think was good enough For them of things below. Nor things in Heaven, which excell, And therefore dost impart, Thy self as the Portion alone Of all upright in Heart. Who then is able to conceive How rich thy Children are? For they have all, since they have thee, And each an equal share. All have a God, all have a Christ, Nay, all that thou hast too; Each one hath thee intirely, This does their Riches show. And they, Lord, never shall have less, Their Portion can't be spent, Nor treacherously by wicked ones From them it can't be rent. Fire can't their bless'd Portion burn, Nor Thieves steal it away; Nor Moths, nor Rust, it can't corrupt, O happy, happy they! The second Part. All things are theirs who have thee Lord, Tho under age they be: But yet that day will quickly come Of their Felicity. When full possession they shall have Of all that is their own, And every one of them thou wilt With lasting Glory Crown. This Portion, ah, how doth it suit! And answer every want, And fully does it satisfie The Soul of every Saint. All Glory and high praise therefore Let us together sing, To God the Father, and the Son, From whence such Riches spring. HYMN 3. [Thy Saints Lord have a dwelling strong] Psal. 90. 1. God the Saints dwelling place. [The First Part.] Thy Saints Lord have a dwelling strong, And thou that dwelling art, No habitation like to this, Hath any haughty Heart. For 'tis the low, and humble Soul That in the Lord does dwell: Where such do rest, and have repose, This dwelling doth excell. A house, ah 'tis our home always, And when we absent be: How do we long for to return, So do our Soul till we Return again unto our God, When we from thee do stray: O bring us to our bless'd abode, Christ Jesus is the Way. We here no perfect rest shall find, Untill we fixed are In our brave house that is above, No Palace like to it here. The second Part. A House preserves from heat and cold, From Winds and cruel storms; Those who Lord dwell in thee are bold, Being safe from fear of harms. And in our House our comforts lie, And all our chiefest treasure: God is our Joy, our Souls delight, In whom is sweetest pleasure. Propriety unto a house Doth make it valued; Our interest in our God, alone, Makes us lift up our head. In a great House are many Rooms To dine and also lye, Rare secret Chambers also we Do in thee clearly spy. Each Attribute is as a Room Whither thy Saints do go By precious Acts of Faith, and then Nothing they fear below. Another house, thô stately 'tis, It may be batterd down; But thou art such a House, O Lord, That can't be overthrown. Hast then away to your abode, Let all with speed hast home, For dreadful storms you may expect Will very quickly come. The Third Part. Chambers of Safety. O come, O come, Gods people all, With speed hast ye away, Enter your Chambers great and small, No longer do you stay: For God, the mighty God above, Is rising out of's place, And will the Hills and Mountains move, And Vengeance pour apace. There is a way found out that ye May be secured, When Sinners shall consumed be Who basely are misled. Doth it not thunder afar off, It Lightens also sore: O tremble all, and do not scoff, For hark 'tis more and more. Children get home, and do not stay, Hast to your dwelling place; For if you make the least delay, Then sad may be your case. All who abroad or in the Fields Do foolishly remain, They may as the Egyptians were, Be ruined and slain. Isa. 26. 20. A Storm a coming. O quake ye who most guilty are, Who love and live in sin; For God will suddenly break forth, As usual hath not been. But sing ye Saints, and joyfull be, Christs Kingdom does draw near, Do you leave all Iniquity, And nothing do you fear. The shaking times that are at hand, Will bring Great Babel down: And then will God save this our Land, And Saints with Blessings Crown. Therefore if ye in Christ are found To every Duty led, And have your Hearts sincere and sound, Look up, lift up your head. For your Redemption does draw near, Gods praises sing therefore: Unto his call do you adhere, Then sing for evermore. HYMN 4. [Rich Husbandmen have House and Land] Joh. 15. 1. God compared to a Husbandman. [The First Part.] Rich Husbandmen have House and Land Both moist and also dry, God o're the Earth hath the Command, And true propriety. The beasts of th'field and fowls of th'Air, With Silver, and the Gold Is all the Lords, yea, and what else Our Eyes can here behold. He may give it to whom he will, And then take it away: He makes men rich, and makes them poor, And none dare him gain-say. Some ground he plows and sows it then With choice and precious seeds; Whilst other ground does barren lie, Eat up and spoil'd with Weeds. And who shall say what doest thou, He may do what he will; All are thine own, what e're thou dost, Yet thou art righteous still. The second Part. A Husbandman knows very well, His ground will barren be, Unless it is well manured, No profit he can see. Even so unless the fallow ground Of thy base wicked heart Be broken up, it will be found That thou most barren art. A Husbandman does spare no cost, Nor grudge at his great pains, That so he may his ground make good, When he his end obtains. So God likewise thinks nought too much Who does great cost bestow On Souls of men, when they prove such Who forth his Glory show. A Husbandman his Trees doth prune, More fruitful them to make, But branches that unfruitful be, Such off the Trees does take. And thus doth God by all those men Who by profession are In Jesus Christ, who barren prove, Them long he will not spare. But such that fruitful Branches be, He purges every one, And abundantly shall they bring forth, Before that he has done. As God doth sow, so he likewise Doth cause the rain to fall, That so his Vineyard flourish may, And's Trees be fruitful all. Which other Husbandmen can't do, Nor can they change the soyl; But God can make Mens hearts most good Which naturally were vile. All praise to him therefore let's give, And set his glory forth, And fruitfully unto him live, Whilst we do live on earth. HYMN 5. [He that did build all things is God] Heb. 3. 4. God the chief Builder. [The First Part.] He that did build all things is God, 'Tis he and he alone That made the world, and all things in't, Praise ye the Holy One. And he laid the Foundation sure Of th'Earth and Heaven too, Which long have been, and still endure, Will put them down also. 'Tis he that built his Glorious Church, And laid the corner stone, In all the Earth there is None such, O praise the Holy One. With precious Stones he hath it built, Yea, living ones they are, And by his Spirit so compact, 'Tis far beyond compare. The Timber, and the Stones by him Were squared curiously, That all the Buildings in the World, With this cannot come nigh. The matter and the form also, Did he alone ordain, No alteration must be made, Upon eternal pain. All other Builders Servants have To labour with their hands; Who according to the pattern act, And just as he commands. So Ministers God does imploy, Who must the pattern know, And if they alter any thing, They do their folly show. The Rule it is Gods Holy Word, Would you the Pattern view, 'Tis the first Church the Lord did build, As th'Apostles Acts do shew. The second Part. Nothing but precious Stones must be On the foundation plac'd, By such who wood or stubble build This fabrick is disgrac'd. And they will suffer loss thereby When it comes to be try'd, Because such stuff cannot endure, Their work will not abide. Then see all ye who are call'd Saints, That you are precious Gold, I mean sincere and godly ones, Whom God loves to behold. And see that you his building are, And in you he does dwell, If in you he has no abode, Down you must go to Hell. HYMN 6. Exod. 15. 3. God a Man of War. [The First Part.] God is a man of war, and he Has many Armies, who Almighty are in strength, therefore Down shall his Foes all go. The Enemies who do ingage Against this Man of war, Are all infernal pow'rs below, And such who wicked are. God is a Warriour just and good, And mighty skill he hath, Before him never any stood In Hell, much less on Earth. 'Tis for his Glory he does take The Sword into his hand, And wo to such who head do make Against his dread Command. In war he is most terrible, If he sets in array, The Battel once against his Foes, They'll soon melt all away. He'll make the earth to tremble when He does gird on his Sword, And cause all proud and haughty men To fall at his own word. If he the Trumpet once does sound, And like a Lion roar, The wicked he will all confound, And Vengeance on them pour. An Armory and Weapons too Of Indignation hath, With Fire and Smoke, and Hail also, He soon can spoil the Earth. If man provoke him to arise, And stir up Jealousy, He like a travailling Woman will Break forth, and loudly cry. A Banner he hath to display, A white Flag he puts out, To see if Sinners will submit, Whose Courage seems so stout. If they will not lay down their Arms, And with him make their peace, Then let them tremble, they shall see Incensed wrath increase. And out his bloody Flag will go, No quarter will he give, But down they fall both great and small, And Vengeance shall receive. The second Part. Wo, wo to all ungodly ones, Who are his bitter Foes; But happy are all Friends of his, And such who with him close. Fear not, ye Saints, this Man of war Is always on your side, And in your quarrel he'll appear, And equally divide To every man his own just Right, And Sion's Cause he'll plead, And will destroy the cursed Whore That long has flourished. Put hark again, for you must know, God's patience near is gone, A warning piece he has let off, The Battel is begun. O sing, ye Saints, God is come forth, An alarm he does sound, The Trumpets blow, and it is heard In every quarter round. The Beast and cursed Babylon, Amazed are to hear What God in England late has done, But stranger things draw near. God forth is coming with a shout, Sing praises, sing praises, He will all his Enemies rout, And good mens hope it raises. HYMN 7. [Thou art, O Lord, a Tower strong] God a strong Tower. [The First Part.] Thou art, O Lord, a Tower strong, And Refuge for the Poor, And that we might all hide in thee, Hast opened a door. Christ is the Door that does let us Into this Tower, where We may be safe, and we all know No other Door is there. Our defence is in the Lord, The high and lofty one, And in thee we most safe shall be, Till all the trouble's gone. Thou art our Shield and Hiding place, To thee we haste away, Fore-seeing Dangers very nigh, Dare now no longer stay. In thee is safety, if we fly, Our Tower is so strong, We fear no Siege, no Mines can hurt, Nor do our Tower wrong. Nor can we starve whilst here we ly, Thy Stores cannot be spent, In thee is Bread, and all supply, No ways can Foes invent To take our Fort, we fear no Bombs Nor Cannon though they roar, But from our Tower the cruel Foes To pieces shall be tore. The second Part. We in this Tower venture may All that to us is dear, Nought can exceed our precious Souls, Let them be lodged there. Strong Parties garrison within, Who oft make sallies out; And one of them can in a night A mighty Army rout. An hundred eighty thousand men, Did one of these destroy, Of cursed Foes who did strive then, Gods Israel to annoy. A Tower strong is compass'd round With a thick mighty wall, For to keep off such Foes who do Pell-mell upon it fall. For Bulwarks God Salvation hath Appointed for the Poor, And he a wall of fire is round About us evermore. Can such who in this Tower are, Be any time afraid, All such who know the strength of it, Can never be dismaid. Take up your Lodging then within, Haste quickly, don't delay, Cast off base Habits, leave your Sin, Christ Jesus is the way. Those who would enter into it, And not by the right Door, Will see themselves without the walls, Before this day is o're. HYMN 8. [A Giant is a man of strength] Job 16. 14 He runneth upon me like a Giant. A Giant is a man of strength, Both fierce and swift also, When like a Giant God appears, He is provok'd we know, By our great sins which grievous are In his most blessed sight, On us therefore as Giants do, Does he break forth with might. As if he would to pieces tear Such, whom his Soul doth love, Yet in his Heart affections dear, Toward us then does move. 'Tis to convince our Souls of sin, And us to humble too, And sit us for some glorious work He has for us to do. And crucifie us to the world, And to each earthly thing, That we might see from him alone, Our chiefest Joy does spring. To exercise our Graces too, This is another end, That they might their great Lustre show, For this does tryals send. And Satan might be silenced, Who does Gods Jobs accuse, From hence, as you have heard and read, God thus his Saints does use. And that Examples God might have Of patience, to sustain Some others of his Children, who May meet with such like pain. Then do not mourn, ye godly ones, When on you God does run, He pities you, and hears your moans, In mercy will return Again to you, and you shall see His sweet and lovely face; Therefore sing ye his praises forth, And prize his glorious Grace. HYMN 9. [A Potter does prepare his Clay] Rom. 9. 21. Hath not the Potter power over the Clay? A Potter does prepare his Clay, Then does the Vessel make, So thou prepares thy work, O Lord, Which thou dost undertake. The Earth thou didst, O Lord, form first, Of which we formed were, Thou didst project also before, What Image we should bear. A Potter divers Vessels makes, VVhich of different sizes are, Some of one form, and others do Another fashion bare. So thou hast different Vessels too, Some noble and some base, Some curiously are wrought within, Adorned with thy Grace. Some for Honour, and some likewise They for dishonour be, But who shall to the Potter say, VVhy is this done by thee? Mayst thou not like the Potter do VVhat seems good in thy sight? Thou mayst give Grace, or it deny, Yet all thou dost is right. O let us then such Vessels be, Most lovely to behold, And gloriously to shine within, Being covered o're with Gold. That we thy praises may set forth, As being all new made: Once we were marr'd, but never more Let our rare Beauty fade. And we will sing to thee, O Lord, And raise thy name on high, For we shall glorious Vessels be To all eternity. HYMN 10. [I will like to a Lion be] Hos. 5. 14. God compared to a Lion. I will like to a Lion be, I'le tear and will devour, Thus dost thou say, O holy One, To shew thy wrathful pow'r Against the wicked, who provoke Thee grievously each day, When patience does to fury turn, Thou'lt sweep them all away. Who can the prey deliver from A hungry Lion? so VVho is't can save or rescue such Thou sayst thou will o're-throw? A Lion when enrag'd is fierce, And all before him fly, So at thy frowns and dreadful wrath, How will the wicked cry! VVhen once the Lion's heard to roar, The Beasts of th'Forest quake, So when thou dost in wrath arise, Sad tremblings thou wilt make. But if before a Lion one Himself does prostrate lie The Lion will not touch his Life, But leave him, and pass by. So thou, O Lord, wilt such forgive, VVho do themselves submit, And by Repentance humbly Lie prostrate at thy seet. The Lion does sometimes couch down, As if asleep he lay, But soon does rise with wrathful frowns, As greedy of his prey. And thus, O Lord, thou seem'st to sleep, And wicked men don't fear, But as a Lion wilt rouze up, And them to pieces tear. Then happy you for whom Christ made With God a lasting peace, 'Tis you may sing, for still you'll find Your Comforts shall increase. HYMN 11. [Moths secretly do seize and eat] Hos. 5. 12. I will be a Moth to Ephraim. Moths secretly do seize and eat, And spoil fair Garments quite; So many times thy Judgments are Hid from most peoples sight. Moths often spoil things rich and rare, As well as of small worth, So thou, O Lord, wilt neither spare The poor nor rich of th'earth: All are alike, O Lord, to thee, If wrath on them do seize, Unsensibly thou canst them spoil Like Moths, if thou dost please. A Moth does eat things by degrees, A little now and then; So gradually thou dost destroy Sometimes vile wicked men. Thou like a Moth, art sometimes, Lord, In Councels Princes trust, Who Plots of Enemies can't see Till out they fiercely burst. And likewise in Estates of men Thou as a Moth does come, Their hopes are great, and much earn they, But bring but little home. Thou dost it blast, and it consumes, Because they don't it use To righteous ends, but basely it To their own Lusts abuse. Strength thus oft-times does wast away In Soul and Body too, And Treasures of Nations decay, Tho few that mind it do. Take heed ye Saints of private sins, Lest God does secretly Bring Judgments on you till he hath Consum'd you utterly. HYMN 12. [Like as a Woman travailing] Isa. 42. 14. Now will I cry like a travailing woman. Like as a Woman travailing Does cry out in her pain, So thou dost say Lord thou wilt do, To pour forth wrath amain. Thy Patience and sweet Lenity Is almost gone, no doubt, And therefore thou most bitterly Wilt quickly now cry out. A Woman when her travel comes From crying can't refrain, So thou wilt cry for Sions sake Like her in grievous pain. A woman in her travel strives Her Child for to bring forth, So thou deliverance for thy Church Wilt work throughout the Earth. Afflicted thou dost seem to be For thy poor Sions sake, And therefore on her Enemies Dread Vengeance thou wilt take. When pangs do on a Woman seize, Deliverance is near. So of thy Foes thou soon wilt ease Thy self it does appear. Behold, ye Saints, Gods Love to you, And sing his glorious praise, Your Enemy he will o'rethrow, And that in these last dayes. HYMN 13. [A consuming Fire dismal is] Heb. 12. 29. For our God is a consuming Fire. [The First Part.] A consuming Fire dismal is, And terrible to see, So is that wrath of thine, O Lord, If kindled once it be. Before thy indignation fierce, What mortal Soul can stand? Thy wrath is poured out like Fire, Which none can countermand. The Mountains are thrown down by thee, Thy wrath doth fiercely burn, And all before thee, thou Lord wilt To Ashes quickly turn. Fire breaks forth sometimes we see, When men are not aware, So shall thy wrath surprize the Earth When men secure are. Like to the writing with the hand On proud Belshazzar's wall, So when thou dost give the Command, Sinners shall tremble all. Fire breaks forth oft times i'th' night, When men are fast asleep, Which does poor people strangely fright, And sorrows on them heap. So in the night of ignorance, Whilst Men lye on their beds, They hear the cry of Fire, Fire, Just burning o're their heads. The Second Part. A fire also consumes amain, It famous Cities spoyl; So thou wilt desolations make Of Sinners who are vile. Can stubble stand before fierce flames, And not consumed be? Then may proud wicked Ones likewise Secure themselves from thee. None can abide thy dreadful wrath, There is no way to fly; For thou wilt them destroy, O God, As stubble fully dry. Some fires may be quenched quite, But thine will always burn; Thy wrath, O Lord, eternal is, It never will be gone. Fire torments most cruelly Such who into't are cast; So will thy wrath all Enemies, Which they shall feel at last. Tremble, you vile and wicked Ones, Consider what you do; On you this fire soon shall seize, And burn for ever too. But all ye Saints rejoyce and sing, God is to you, ye see, A fire to warm, and to give light, By which you quickn'd be. Ah! happy such behold therefore The difference between A wicked and a godly Man, And praise the Lord agen. HYMN 14. [Thou art our Arm of Help, O God] Deut. 33. 27. Underneath are the everlasting Arms. Thou art our Arm of Help, O God Shall we thy mercy see? An Arm stretch'd out of the thick Cloud, To strenghen such as we. How usefull is an Arm to us, The body to defend? So is thy love and power, Lord, On which we do depend. The Arm bears up and does support Such who most feeble be; Thy weak and feeble Saints also, Are, Lord, born up by thee. The Arm the Body does protect, And save it from all harms; So thou dost us defend and save By thy Almighty Arms. We with our Arms embrace our Friend, And hug such we do love; We by thine Arms of power and grace Embrac'd are from above. Thy Arm, O Lord is very strong, The vilest Soul can'st save: Not shortned, but very long, Thy help let Sinners have. Wo, wo to them, this Arm of thine In wrath is laid upon; But happy such who it upholds, Thrice happy such a one. Remember Saints when you are low, Whose Arms are under you; And sing God's praise continually, Who will Salvation show. HYMN 15. [The Lord he is our Sun and Shield] Psal. 84. 11. The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield.. The Lord he is our Sun and Shield, Our Buckler and Safeguard; And hence we stand, and will not yield, Though Enemies press hard. Like as a Shield the blow keeps off The Enemy lays on; So thou keeps off all hurt from us, And saves us every one. Let Foes strike at us as they please, On the head, or the heart; This precious Shield which we do use, Secureth every part. From Sin, from Satan, and the World, No Dart we need to fear; Since thou art such a Shield to us, O God, and Saviour dear. Our Shield, and our great Reward, To thee all praise be given; Who wilt thy saving-help afford, Until we come to Heaven. HYMN 16. [O Holy and Eternal One] Psal. 46. 1. God is our Refuge. [The First Part.] O Holy and Eternal One, Thou art a Refuge sure; Help us to fly to thee alone, Whose Mercies do endure. A Refuge strong thou art, O Lord, Help us to fly to thee: Shall we take hold of thy blest Word, And safe for ever be? O Lord we bless and praise thy Name, There is a Refuge found; For us who are pursued hard, This is a joyful sound. O Souls, then see with speed we pray To Jesus Christ to fly, Lest th'Avenger, through delay, O retake you, and you die. The way is easie to find out, All stumbling blocks are gone; O haste with speed, and look about, Dangers are coming on. God like a Refuge does give ease, And fortifie the Mind; When horror does on others seize, Security we find. This Refuge never will us fail, All others will not do; God never will leave us so frail, But present help will shew. Of every sin let us get clear, Yea, freedom from each guilt; To Christ by Faith let us adhere, To wash away all filth. The Second Part. O Lord to thee, to thee we fly, A dismal day's at hand; But if we leave iniquity, In safety shall we stand. Under thy Wings with speed we pray Hide us, Lord, every one; Then safe shall we be day and night, Till all the trouble's gone. And we will thy praises sing forth, And shall lift thy Name on high; And also triumph on earth, Whilst others howl and cry. All glory unto God, that we Have such a hiding-place; Always shall we rejoyce in thee, when we behold thy face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II SACRED HYMNS To the Praise of Jesus Christ: In which his transcending Excellencies are set forth. HYMN 17. [A breach most fore there was between] Heb. 12. 24. To Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant. [The First Part.] A breach most fore there was between Poor Sinners, Lord, and thee; Before the Fall nought then was seen But perfect amity. But Man, by breaking thy just Law, Is now become thy Foe; And as thou dost him loath and hate, So he doth thee also. The carnal Mind is enmity Against the holy God; And in us all (Lord) naturally Like enmity abode. But thou in mercy and great love, Through wisdom infinite, Hast found a way wrath to remove, And Sinners to unite Unto thy self in lasting bonds Of precious grace and peace, 'Tis done by Christ, our blessed Lord, In him thy wrath does cease. He is that Days-man who lays hold On both, that so he might Thee reconcile unto our Souls, And us to thee unite. He brings thee, Lord, down unto us, And carries us to thee; And thus is he dear and precious, Yea, all in all is he. Second Part. Thy honour in Each Attribute He sought to glorifie; Yet did his undertakings suit Our wants all to supply. In ev'ry thing to such degree Due glory thou dost gain; And we relief unto the full Through him, Lord, do obtain. In him Justice and Mercy meet, And gloriously do shine; Both equally in splendour fit, As both alike divine. As Mediator he was, Lord, Exactly qualify'd; Most wise and just, yet merciful, That so he might divide An equal part in a right way Unto each party, so God might be just, yet Justifie, And pardon Sinners too. To God he is a Friend most dear, Nay, of so near a-kin, His express Image he does bear, Yet we may say agen, To us he is related too, Our nature he did take; From hence he knew well what would do, An equal peace to make. Third Part. Lord, thou wast the offended One, Whom we had grieved sore; Thou chose Christ to this work alone, And cancell'd the old score. In him thy Soul well pleased is, Who did thy wrath appease; 'Tis he who reconciles us too, And does our burthens ease. Such who accept of terms of peace, As offered they be By Jesus Christ, the breach will cease Between that Soul and thee. But if the terms refused are, There will be no Appeal Allowed such at the last day, They must thy vengeance feel. Come in, ye Sinners, then with speed, O see to him you fly! For he to you his hand must lend, To slay that enmity That's in your heart's which change he must, If ever you receive Those terms which are agreed on, Our precious Souls to save. HYMN 18. [We once, O Lord, concerned were] Heb. 7. 22. So much was Jesus made Surety of a better Testament. We once, O Lord, concerned were In a commerce with thee; Before we fell, no need was there Of any Surety. But we run out, and wasted all, Which was a mighty store; And, ah! our credit is so gone, Thou wilt trust us no more. Unless 'tis so, a Surety's sound, We must in Prison lye; And bear thy dreadful wrath, O God, Unto eternity. Christ therefore, Lord, thou didst find out, No Friend had we to bring; All good therefore which we receive, Doth from thy bowels spring. Ah! he this work did undertake, And hands for us did strike; And such a Surety, O Lord, For us O thou didst like. Who faithful was, and able too, Even all our debts to pay; And all our sins thy word does show Upon him thou didst lay. Unto thy blessed Covenant Ah! he did put his hand; And in our stead laid down his life, As thou gav'st him command. 'Twas thou Lord Christ who in our room To th'Father didst engage To satisfie his justice, and His wrath for to asswage. O what great Love and Grace is here Thou knowest very well; Thou must pay all, and our sins bear, Which would sink us to Hell. HYMN 19. [But thou wast able to sustain] The Second Part, set after the Sacrament. But thou wast able to sustain That heavy weight of sin; And for our Souls didst life obtain, And righteousness bring in. 'Twas from the worth and dignity Which in thy Person lay, Thou didst God's justice satisfie, And all our debts defray. Thou being God as well as Man, Thy Merits have such worth, As a compensation full to make, And liberty bring forth, For us who did in Prison lye, Being bound with cruel bonds, Which none could loose assuredly, But thy own blessed hands. By that one single payment, Lord, Laid down when thou didst die, Relief to us thou dost afford, Who dead in sin did lye. For as poor Debtors we were all, So Criminals were too; And death deserved great and small, Condemn'd in law also. And thou as Surety for us, Gav'st up thy self to die; And in our stead, Lord, thou didst thus God's justice satisfie. The Third Part. And now the Covenant stands sure In Christ's most blessed hands; All good for us he did procure, Which in him firmly stands. And thus he did engage for those That given to him are; And therefore all that God hath chose Shall Crowns of Glory wear. What grace and favour now is this, That Christ the Just should die, That we unjust and guilty ones Might live eternally. Let Men take heed how they despise Such soveraign grace and love, 'Cause 'tis mysterious in their eyes, And also far above Depraved Reason to conceive, That such who guilty be, Should by another's righteousness From sin and guilt be free. All praise and glory unto God, And to the Son therefore; And to the Holy Ghost let us Sing praise for evermore. HYMN 20. [Thou mighty King, whose glories shine] Matth. 25. 6. Christ the Bridegroom of o?ur? Souls. [The First Part.] Thou mighty King, whose glories shine, A secret didst disclose Unto that blessed Son of thine, Which was for to dispose Of him, in a sweet Marriage state, And unto him likewise All things about it didst relate, Who quickly cast his eyes Upon our Souls, for we were those With whom he fell in love; And whom for him the Father chose, Who nothing had to move His dear affections, for alas! We loathsom were to see; And were in a most dismal case Through our iniquity. But yet thy love it was so great, A Journey didst thou take From Heav'n to Earth, that so thou might A Marriage with us make. But ah! what didst thou suffer first Before this could be done; For we were Cast, Lord, for our Lives, And Condemn'd every one. And thou couldst never us obtain, Nor with us marriage make, Unless to free us from that pain Didst die, Lord, for our sake. And this thou didst most readily, All praise unto thy Name; We purchas'd were with thy dear Blood, And so thine own became. The second Part. The glorious Bridegroom. O what a choice, Lord, hast thou made! Are such vile ones as we Unto thy lovely bosom laid, And joyned unto thee? Are we espous'd to such a Prince, The King of Heav'n and Earth? Who has o're all preheminence, Whose glories thus shine forth. Angelick Nature didst pass by, And set thy tender heart On such as we: O let us cry, Thou lovely, lovely art. Yet ah! how long was it before Thou couldst make us to yield? We were so dark, but now, O Lord, Thou, thou hast won the Field. Let us our selves give up to thee, As overcome with love; And comfort us continually With Cordials from above. Ah! at this door our joys come in, This is the blessed spring Of all true good; for having thee, We have, Lord, ev'ry thing. And if Communion we enjoy, And find thy comfort sweet, Our Souls shall sing, and raise thy praise, Whilst we lye at thy feet. The Third Part. The praise of the sacred Bridegroom. Praise in the highest, joys betide These sacred Lovers dear; The holy Bridegroom and his Bride Most glorious do appear. Let Heaven above be fill'd with Songs, Who see how they do shine On Eath beneath, let all Mens Tongues Sing forth his praise divine. If sullen Man refuse to speak, (Since Heaven and Earth combine,) Let Rocks and stones their silence break, And sing his praise divine. Ah! 'twas this sacred Bridal Knot To tye thou didst design; O let such love ne're be forgot, Such sacred love of thine. Ye holy Seraphims above, O haste and come away, Who do admire Jesus love, Sing ye his praise each day. With Saints on Earth your joys divide, With speed O do ye come; Earth ne're produc'd so fair a Bride, Nor Heaven a Bridegroom. Whose Feet are like to burning Brass, Whose Eyes a flaming Fire; Who bringeth mighty things to pass, Sing to him, him admire. The fourth Part. Our hearts the praises must express Of Juda's glorious Lion; The sweet and fragrant Flower of Jess The blessed King of Zion. To him that on the Throne doth sit, Oh 'tis his praise alone That we will sing: O it is fit We praise the holy One. Our hearts and tongues should all rejoyce (Angels in consort sing) Aloud with a melodious voice, Praise ye our glorious King; Whose Head is whiter than the Snow That's driven with the Wind; Whose Visage like a flame doth show, And doth all things confin'd. And yet he unconfined is, Magnifie him alone; What Lover is there like to this, Sing praise to th'holy One. Let's raise his Name who hath reveal'd His sweet eternal love; Who by his stripes our Souls hath heal'd, Now is enthron'd above. Let trumps of praise ascend on high, Let them be loudly blown; So that an Eccho pierce the skie Of praise to th'Three in One. The fifth Part. If Saints neglect this duty should, Or to sing be averse; Sure rugged Rocks and Mountains would God's Praises soon reherse. The twinkling Stars that day and night Do their long circuits run: The Moon too in her monthly flight, Also the glorious Sun. All these do through the Universe God's blessed praise make known; How can the Saints be then averse, To sing to th'Holy One. Let every Saint on Earth rejoyce, O therefore let them msing, Since Christ hath made them his sweet choice, Let them praise their dear King. Especially all you who be Filled with joy, raptur'd in bliss; Who can say, My Beloved's mine, And I am also his. Sing this as the Hundredth Psalm. Hail glor'ous Prince, the precious Air Eccho's Praise to th'illustrious Pair! Let no dark Clouds of Night obscure This blessed Day, but thus endure: Let Mortals now in Consort sing Anthems to th'Eternal King: Nor Frost, nor scorching Heat of June, Ne're put thy Singers out of Tune. Hail glorious Prince, whose matchless love Brought thee from thy high Throne above To court thy Spouse in a poor dress, Yet was thy Glory ne're the less: Though thou wast treated with disdain, Yet Angels waited on thy Train; Shepherds thy joyful Welcom sing, And Wise Men do their Oblations bring: Blessed Espousals our Freedom bought, A Match that our Redemption wrought. Hail glorious Spouse, blessed in him That Crowns thee with Heav'ns Diadem: Behold an unparallel'd story, A Slave advanc'd to lasting glory; A Virgin fetter'd in her sin, Once vile, but now glorious within; From base estate, a Queen of Honour, And peerless Beauty put upon her: Since words can't do't (Conceptions weak) Our Joys in Extasies let's speak. [In thee the Father shines most clear] Heb. 1. 3. Who is the express Image of his Person. In thee the Father shines most clear, And such who do thee see, The Father may behold likewise His Known, O Lord, by thee. Thou dost him clearly represent Unto our very sight, Whose express Image, Lord, thou art Most glorious and bright. Such whom the Father never saw, To them thou dost him show; All his perfections are in thee, What further would we know? Thou dost, Lord, represent to us God, whom we cannot see; He dwells in light inaccessible, Which can't approached be. Thou brings him to our minds and sight, Whereby we may conceive Of his eternal glory bright, And clearer knowledge have Of him, and also him adore In thee, and by thee too; But after all we must confess We little see or know. All praise and glory unto God, And Christ, in whom doth shine All glories which the Father hath, Most sacred and divine. HYMN 22. [Thou, Lord, the good Physician art] Mat. 9. 12. They that are whole, need not a Physician, but they that are sick. [The First Part.] Thou, Lord, the good Physician art, Who knowest very well All the diseases of our heart, And also hast such skill, That thou dost know what 'tis likewise Will ease us of our pain; Nay, perfectly so cure us, We sick shan't be again. And thou wast authorized too, The Father licens'd thee; And did appoint thee to this work, Physician of Souls to be. And thou approved hast been oft; The works which thou didst do, Did witness bear to thy great skill, Authority also. Thou know'st our constitution sins, And from whence they proceed; The cause of each disease within, And how we may be freed From the curst Plague, Contagion great, That reigns in every part; No member's free, nor faculty, But rages most i'th'heart. There, there the cursed venom lyes, But thou canst fetch it out; And make a perfect cure too, Of this we have no doubt. The second Part. But it is true, no medicin's found Which, Lord, can do us good, So as to make us whole and sound, But our Physician's Blood; And therefore thou didst pour it forth; Thy precious blood was shed, That we might it apply by Faith, And also be cured. For all our hearts, Lord, naturally So hard and stony are, Till softned with thy blood, we see They can't thy Image bear. Nought will dissolve the Adamant And flinty heart we know, But precious blood which from thy wounds Most plenteously did flow. But such who never sick were made, Or did their sickness see, Are never like thy help to have, Nor cure find of thee. Thou first does make us see our sin, And then when we do cry, Thy Oyl and Wine thou dost put in, Which heals us presently. But some don't love to feel the pain, But would slight healed be, And have their sores but skinned o're, Such Souls are left by thee. For each dead Member off must go, Right-eyes be pulled out; Or else the soul and body too Shall go to Hell no doubt. The Third Part. Thou all Physicians dost excell, They can't all Persons cure; But there is none but thou canst heal, Yea, heal O Lord for ever. They do it likewise for their gain, But thou dost all in love; And poor wast made for us, O Lord, Who rich was once above. To make us sound and whole at heart, And heal our souls for ever, Thou didst with all thy riches part, And grievous pains endure. The dead to life they cannot raise, But this, Lord, thou dost do; And hadst not thou, Lord, qaickned us, We had been lost we know. They cannot bless Physick they give, Neither know the success; But all that Means which does us good, Lord, thou to us dost bless. The fourth Part. Other Physicians Men send to, We did not send for thee; But freely didst thou come to us, That we might healed be. O let us then love thee, O Lord, And let poor Sinners cry, And come to thee, thou wilt them heal, And cure presently. But let them not the time delay, Neither false Med'cines use, Which may perhaps through a mistake Seem to afford some ease. And since, Lord, thou hast heal'd our souls, And cured hast each sore, Let's sing thy praise, with all in us Praise thee for evermore. HYMN 23. [Lord Christ, thou the Testator art] Heb. 9. 16. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator. [The First Part.] Lord Christ, thou the Testator art Of the New Testament; And hadst much Goods to give away, Thou to this end was sent: And full of thoughts thou wast also How of them to dispose; But some there were which thou didst know Thy Father long had chose To be the only Legatees Who unto thee were dear; And unto them thou didst bequeath All things that thou hadst here Below on Earth, and all above; They Heirs are made indeed Of all the Riches of both Worlds, What more, Lord, can we need? All things were given unto thee, Thou art thy Fathers Heir; And we with thee Joynt-Heirs are too, So much beloved are. The time drew near that thou must die, And die thou didst likewise; But first didst make thy Will, O Lord, Which in thy Gospel lyes. And that is thy last testament, For thou wilt make no more; And by thy blood confirm'd it is, And that, Lord, o're and o're. And for a Sign the Sacraments Thou didst likewise ordain, That we might see thy true intent, And never doubt again. The second Part. The former Will didst disannull; For it was weak we see, Since nothing perfect it could make, 'Twas took away by thee. Thou the Testator being dead, (Yet didst revive again,) Thy Will must not be altered, Upon eternal pain. Each Precept as by thee 'tis left, With care we must observe; And from thy will and testament We Lord, must, never swerve. If Angels should this thing attempt, They cursed then must be; Let Men then tremble who have done This great iniquity. Nothing must added be thereto, Nor nothing from it took; Then wo to such; What will they do, Who have thy Word forsook? And thy last Will and Testament Gives right and title too Unto thy Saints of all grace here, And glory, Lord, also. Like a Testator, thou hast nam'd The Persons who shall have The great Possession that's above, Or who 'tis thou wilt save. They are all such whom God did give, Dear Saviour unto thee; Who shall in time on thee believe, Yea, and new creatures be. O then let's see if we are such, And sweetly let us sing; For who is able to conceive What comfort hence does spring. HYMN 24. [Like as a Hart has a quick sight] Cant. 2. 9. My Beloved is like a Roe, or young Hart. Like as a Hart has a quick sight, So thou art quick to see; All wants that do attend thy Saints, Lye open unto thee. Their dangers too thou dost perceive All things before thee lye; And help from thee we all shall have, And that most speedily. And like a Hart art quick to hear, Although we do but groan; The smallest sigh comes up to thee, It pierces does thy Throne. Thou loving art unto thy Spouse, Thou dost exceed the Hind; Most dearly dost thou tender her, And bear her in thy mind. And as a Hart is swift to run, And can the Mountains climb; So thou art swift to help thy Saints, And all wilt in good time. No opposition Men can make, Or greatest difficulty Can thee obstruct; for they relief Shall have most speedily. Let's therefore sing, and also say, Be thou like a young Hart; O haste, dear Saviour, come away, Thy blessing to impart. HYMN 25. [A way is found to happiness] Joh. 10. 9. I am the Door. A way is found to happiness, Heaven is a lovely place; Thou art the Door, O Lord, alone Through thee we see God's face. All good lyes hid in God above, Like to a House of store; And such who would go in and eat, Must enter by this Door. All true Men enter the right way, They at the door go in; No Pardon, Peace, but 'tis by thee, Nor cleansing from our sin. We in thy Church ought all to dwell, Bring in more souls and more By thy Example, Doctrine too, Thou art the only Door. All praise and glory unto God Let us now sing again; For shewing to us the right Door, And bringing of us in. HYMN 26. [Lord Christ, thou like a Servant wast] Isa. 41. 1. Behold my Servant, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Lord Christ, thou like a Servant wast, Whilst thou did here remain; Such hard work was allotted thee, As put thee to great pain. 'Twas hard work to redeem thy Church, Thou sweat'st great drops of Blood; Never did any Man sweat such, 'Twas only for our good. Hard work it was to war and fight Against those cruel foes, Which sought our ruin day and night, But thou layest on such blows, That all infernal spirits yield, Sin, World and Death also Thou hast o'recome, and won the field, This does thy power show. 'Twas hard to die, that was thy work, And more must yet be done; Thy Temple build, and Vineyard plant, Fell to thy lot alone. Servants are of inferiour rank, Thou didst thy self deny, And didst not reputation seek, 'Twas great humility VVhich thou was pleased then to show; Thy Fathers honour sought, And unto him great honour too Thou by thy work hast brought. The second Part. 'Twas not to do thy will alone, But his who did thee send; In ev'ry thing, O holy One, Thou didest condescend: Thou hast to wages a just right, As other Servants have; Hence crowned art with glory bright, And more than that dost crave, The souls of all thine own Elect Thy wages are also; VVith grace they must be all bedeck't, And crown'd they shall be too. The Heathen's thine Inheritance, Possession thou must have Of all the Earth, in God's good time The same thou shalt receive. Because thou didst thy soul pour forth, God to thee will divide A portion with th'Kings o'th' Earth, To bring down all their pride. They at thy feet their Crowns shall lay, And to thee bend their knees; The Scepter thou alone shalt sway, And chop down all high Trees. And though a Servant, yet a Son, And faithful was and true; And nothing thou hast left undone, VVhich to thee he did shew. But all things plainly didst declare, Even all thy Father's will, VVhich in thy word's left very clear, That we it might fulfill. The Third Part. O let us now learn of thee, Lord, And be of rhe same mind; And humble Servants all become, Then shall we comfort find: And of thy service never be Asham'd; sor if we are, Thy face with comfort shall not see, But wrathful frowns must bear. Thou in thy Father's House, O Lord, For ever dost abide; We from thy lips must take God's Law, The glory not divide Betwixt thy self and Moses, who Is turned out of door; Ah! him we must not hearken to, But to thee evermore. This let us do with greatest care, Since thou so faithful art; And every thing hast left so clear To every thinking heart. Thy praises therefore we will sing, And set thy glory forth, VVho though a Servant, yet art King, Yea, King of Heaven and Earth. HYMN 27. [Thou art a King in Dignity] Rev. 7. 14. He is King of Kings, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Thou art a King in Dignity, And of most noble birth, Descended from the Lord most high, The God of Heaven and Earth. And thou also proclaimed art By Men and Angels too, To be the only Potentate Before whom all must bow. God's Spirit did thee King anoint, To reign for evermore; And to this office thee appoint, When out God did it pour Abundantly, to such degree That none before thee had; And like a King with Sovereignty, Lord Jesus thou art clad. All power unto thee is given As Mediator, so That all on Earth and Heaven must Yield all obedience to. Thou hast thy Laws, and 'tis by them We must be rul'd alway; And such who will not own thee King, Thou wilt destroy one day. Adore, and see ye reverence him, All ye who live on Earth; Obey his Laws, Saints sing his Praise, And set his Glory forth. The second Part. He's King of Saints and Nations too, He in our hearts must reign; And sway the Sceptre there alone, All Rebels must be slain. The tyrant sin you must give up To his victorious sword; Least countenance to any lust, None of us must afford. But he a larger Kingdom hath; For he shall soon possess All Kingdoms which are thro' the Earth, With peace he will them bless. This power to himself he'll take In spite of Earth and Hell; And haughty Monarchs he will shake, And tyranny expell. Thou, like a King, dost honour give, Yea, titles which are high; For ev'ry Subject's made by thee A Prince in dignity. A Kingdom too thou hast in store For every one of them; And they shall reign for evermore, O're such who did contemn These faithful Servants who to thee Sincerely did adhere; And they, when thou O Lord dost come, Shall Crowns of Glory wear. Sing praises therefore, O ye Saints, Sing praise unto our King; And make the fame of Jesus Christ Throughout the Earth to ring. HYMN 28. [Lord Jesus thou art like a Lamb] Rev. 5. 5. The Lion of the Tribe of Juda hath prevailed, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Lord Jesus thou art like a Lamb, Most meek and innocent; Yet like a Lion art also To such who don't repent Until the time thou dost awake, And rise up to the prey; Then vengeance on them thou wilt take, And them in wrath wilt slay. Thy Majesty is full of dread, And with thy awful frown, As Lions do, so wilt thou roar, And tear great Babel down. A Lion is the King of Beasts, And also very strong; That thou art King of all the Earth, They all shall know e're long. Thou like a Lion wilt revenge The injury done to thine; And righteously retaliate On such who did design The ruin of thy chosen ones, Whom they have sadly spoyl'd; For thou hast heard their bitter groans, Whilst Foes have them revil'd. Therefore ye Sinners now submit, That you may favour find; And throw your selves at Jesus feet, To mercy he's inclin'd. If you before this Lion do Your selves now prostrate lye; Your great humility do show, You'll find his clemency. The Second Part. When th'Lion roars all Beasts do quake Which in the Forest be; When out of Sion Christ does roar, All tremble will you'll see. What will become of Murtherers, Who have destroy'd the earth, When inquisition's made for blood, And thy wrath breaketh forth? Ye Saints of his, by Faith and Prayer Do you this Lion rouze, To save poor Sion, and to tear To pieces all his Foes. And now ye wicked wretches all Who don't this Lion fear, But think his Lamb-like nature's such, No Lion he'll appear; You'll find er'e long his clemency Will into fury turn; And will not then regard your cry, Whilst you in Hell do burn. But all ye Saints rejoyce and sing, This Lion's on your side; 'Tis for your sakes he will arouze, And soon the prey divide. And i'th' mean while he able is To save you and defend, And full of bowels is to you, And so will be to th'end. HYMN 29. [Thou art a Priest, Lord Christ, we know] Heb. 7. 26. For such an High Priest becometh us. [The First Part.] Thou art a Priest, Lord Christ, we know, The Father did thee call; And consecrated thee likewise, 'Twas he did thee install. Into this place and office great Thy self to glorifie, As our High Priest thou didst not seek, Lord, 'twas not in thine eye: But hadst a lawful call thereto, By him who had the right For to confer Priesthood on thee, 'Twas pleasant in his sight. God did thee then anoint also With Oyntment all divine; And Priestly Robes did put on thee, Which gloriously do shine. Thy work it was, and thine alone To offer Sacrifice; 'T was with thy Blood thou didst attone for our iniquities. They daily Offerings did bring, But none could wrath appease; But from thy one sweet Offering God's justice thou dost please To such degree that he does cry, He's pacify'd for ever; And all that do unto thee fly, They pardon'd are besure. The Second Part. It is thy Lips that Knowledge teach; The Law too we must have From thy own Mouth, whose words can reach Our precious Souls to save. Thou of Uncleanness art to judge, The Plague of Leprosie, When in the Head it does appear, Thou knowest perfectly. When sin in the affection's found, And cursed enmity Is in the mind, thou dost pronounce Their plague i'th' Head to lie. 'Tis thou, Lord Christ, whose work [illeg.] Thy people all to bless; Which thou dost do by turning them From sin and wickedness. Thou blesses them with grace and peace, These blessings are indeed; Those who are blessed, Lord by thee, From Death and Hell are freed. Thou, as the High Priest did of old, Enter'd the Holy place; So thou didst enter Heaven it self, Fill'd full of precious grace. And 'twas by blood thou didst go in, That Blood of thine most dear; And hast attonement made for sin, And therefore dost appear Before the Throne of God most high, Having redemption gain'd, Which last will to eternity, Such blessing hast obtain'd. The Third Part. The Prayers of Saints like a Perfume Come up to God above; As being offer'd, Lord, by thee, Whose Incense he doth love. They offered the Bodies of Beasts, VVhich could not satisfie God's justice, neither could that Blood Our Conscience purifie. And therefore thou (and once for all) Didst offer up thy Blood; And by that one Offering hast thou Procur'd our lasting good. No Priest hast thou for to succeed, No Offering more for Sin; For if we needed any else, Thine had not perfect bin. Let Romish Errours then be loath'd, Of a Successor vain; Let Antichrist with shame be cloath'd, Who would Christ's glory stain. Now let us bring true contrite hearts, That is a Sacrifice That God through Jesus Christ does love, And very highly prize: And unto him let's offer up Both Prayer and Praise each day; And on the Merits of his Blood Our selves for ever stay. And also to our High Priest sing With grace in all our hearts; Whose precious Blood is that one Spring Of all good he imparts. HYMN 30. [Thou art a Shepherd, and thy Sheep] Joh. 10. 11. I am the good Shepheard. Thou art a Shepherd, and thy Sheep Are all most dearly bought; Most safely thou wilt them all keep, The lost ones shall be sought. Into green Pastures we are led, Most blessed Lord, by thee; And there are we most choicely fed, Well water'd also be. Thy Sheep to purchase thou didst die, What Shepherd was so good? None never loved his Sheep so, To buy them with his Blood. A Fold, and a sweet resting-place Thou dost also provide, To shadow us from scorching heat, And to refresh our mind. Thy voice let's hear, and follow thee, A Stranger's voice let's know; And them forsake, the right way take, Where the old Flock did go. And to our Shepherd we will sing, When we thy Mark can see On us is set, from thence will spring Joy to eternity. HYMN 31. [He that would some choice thing attain] Joh. 14. 6. I am the way. [The First Part.] He that would some choice thing attain, Or to a place would go; A way for him some must explain, And he the way must know. We, Lord, would find the way to bliss, Where does thy Father dwell; No Habitation like to his, His favour does excell. How shall we take up our abode In him whom we should love? How shall we find the way to God, And come to him above? The way was barr'd up by our sin, Another's opened; Thou art the way, by thee must we For evermore be led. By thy sweet Life, and by thy Death, And by thy Doctrine too, Thou art the way, none else on earth Is there for us to go. The Second Part. There is no way to God most high, But only Lord by thee; No other Name whereby we sav'd, O Lord, can ever be. As thou the Mediator art, And didst attone for sin; And thy own merits dost impart, The way in thee is seen. As thou a Priest for us didst die, A King o're us to reign; And as a Prophet us to teach, We see the way most plain. The way of pardon and of peace, And to be justify'd; The way to union with our God, It is by thee who dy'd. If we would have eternal life, Thou art the way thereto; 'Tis not by our own righteousness, Though some that way do go. No 'tis by thee, by thee alone, Thou art the way, O Lord; 'Tis by thy merits, on them to rest, Thy grace do thou afford. And we thy praises will sing forth, And in the way rejoyce; Nay sing again melodiously With a most chearful voice. The Third Part. This is the good old way we know, Who ever saved were, 'Twas in this way they all did go, None else did God prepare. Yet 'tis a new and living way, Prepared 'twas by blood; O walk in it, don't go astray, The way is very good. Most safe and easie to the soul Who does on Christ depend; And in the way we do each day Meet with our dearest Friend. Sweet company besides also, Who do each other love; For none can in this streight way go, But those born from above. We in the way find all things cheap, Our charges all are born; And other blessings thou dost heap, Rouze up and do not mourn. Ye drooping Souls, you have a Guide Who never will you leave; And will defend you on e'ry side, If unto him you cleave. Besides you are now almost come Unto your journeys end; Behold you are in sight of home, Your pace O therefore mend. Cast off your loads, O come away, And sing as you do go; Sing praise to Christ continually, From whence all blessings flow. HYMN 32. [The Rock of Ages Lord thou art] 1 Cor. 10. 4. And that Rock was Christ. The Rock of Ages Lord thou art, On thee we do depend; Upon this Rock let us be built, And then let Rains descend: Let Floods rise high, and let Storms beat, We shall securely stand, Whilst others Fall, Lord, will be great, Who build upon the Sand. O in this Rock let us be hid, And then we will not fear; Though Seas do swell, and Waves do roar, And dangers great are near. In this sweet Rock we Honey find, And living Waters flow; This Rock likewise does Jewels sweat, Here's golden Mines also. This Rock is high, mount up with speed, You Canaan may espy; If you by Faith ascend this Rock, To you it will seem nigh. Here let us dwell, the shadow's good For such who weary be; The hungry soul here may have food, And be from dangers free. Then sing ye praise unto your Rock, No Rock is like to this; The Rock of our Salvation great A Sanctuary is. Do not forsake your Rock be sure, O sing continually; Our dwelling-place it is secure, Praise him that dwells on high. HYMN 33. [Thou art a Fountain, Holy One] Zech. 13. 1. In that day there shall be a Fountain opened, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Thou art a Fountain, Holy One, The Head of ev'ry Spring; All fulness is in thee alone, To thee we therefore sing. A Fountain full of grace and peace, Nay it does overflow; Its waters run, and never cease, The like's not here below. A vent is made, and it does run, And sends its waters forth; The streams this way and that way turn To water the dry earth. All the low places do receive These waters evermore; On humble souls who do believe, Thou dost thy blessings pour. Into these Valleys thou dost send Thy precious streams amain; Those Meadows well are watered, Yea, watered again. Like as the Sun is full of light, And Waters fill the Sea; So art thou full of goodness, Lord, So is that grace in thee. How many Vessels hast thou fill'd Since first the Fountain run! And many thousands more wilt fill Before that thou hast done! The Second Part. All Souls of Saints that ever were, Who did true grace possess, Were fill'd by thee, and yet we see There's ne're a drop the less. Great Vessels, Lord, thy Churches be, Yet all these thou dost fill; A gracious measure they all have, According to thy will. A bigger Vessel we espy Thou empty wilt anon; And fill it full of grace likewise Before that thou hast done. This Vessel, Lord, is the whole Earth That now abounds with sin; Thou wilt it empty o're awhile, And fill it full agen. Nay, thou wilt turn it upside down, As some their Vessels do; To empty it of wickedness, Which now aboundeth so. And then the earth with knowledge shall As Seas with water swell, Be filled, Lord, and that by thee, As Holy Writ does tell. And well it is thou hast so much Water of life in thee; For all our Vessels empty are, Besides they leaky be. Nor is there any other Well Our wants for to supply; We must unto this Fountain come, Or else our souls will die. Third Part. All people that on earth do dwell, Of water stand in need; But none is there to be found out, But what, Lord, does proceed. From thine own self, and now O well Unto thee we will sing; O mighty Sea! and Fountain deep! And every lasting Spring! With Saints of old we'll sing this Song, And say, Spring up O Well; And send thy water forth, and now Refresh thy Israel. Here we may wash, and healed be, And cleansed from our sin; Here we may drink who thirsty are, And never thirst agen. O come unto the Fountain now! O haste and come with speed! Behold 'tis open, come away, These waters you do need, Before the Fountain is seal'd up, Or God the stream does turn; O come ye Sinners, wash your souls! See how the waters run! HYMN 34. [Thou holy Son of God most high] Col. 1. 18. He is the Head of the Body, the Church. [The First Part.] Thou holy Son of God most high, 'Tis thou who art the Head Of Angels, whose great dignity Most famously is spread. Ye glorious Seraphims above, And Principalities, Most willingly do Christ adore, In whom all fulness lyes. Thou art the Head of human race, The Head of every Man; The Head too of thy Church also, Thy glory no tongue can Set forth according to thy worth, Most great in dignity; And of such high and noble birth, All Beings dost outvie. 'Tis by thy glorious influence The body is sustain'd; As thou hast the preheminence, Thou hast all glories gain'd. Each member is supply'd by thee, And held in sacred bonds; And nourish'd are continually, And under thy commands. The governing part lyes in the head, In it our glory lies; And if the head be once strook off, The body straitway dies. Second Part. And since thou livest evermore, From hence also we know Thy body and each member shall For ever live also. All praise and glory therefore we Ascribe unto our Head; All reverence belongs to thee, By whom we're governed. But one head can the body have, And if it should have two, It would a frightful monster be, All mortal Creatures know. Now cursed Babel, look thou to't, And weigh it well therefore; For since thou hast a new Head got, Thou art an errant Whore. HYMN 35. [Hail, blessed Lamb, thou Lamb of God] Joh. 1. 36. Behold the Lamb of God. [The First Part.] Hail, blessed Lamb, thou Lamb of God, So harmless and so meek; Thy glory great O we would raise, Thy honour always seek. No spot nor blemish was in thee, But yet, Lord, thou wast sold For a poor price, who's worth can't be Computed nor be told. Sold and deliver'd up also Into the Butchers hands; Who mangled thee inhumanly Who Heaven and Earth commands. A Sacrifice thou didst become, Thou willing wast to die; And meekly as a Lamb is dumb, Thou took'st it patiently. The Second Part. No Lamb so innocent as thou, Nor none so lovely are; And in a bosom thou didst lye, With whom none can compare. The best of all the flock above, The chief of all below: Behold him then, and fall in love Ye would if you did know The worth of him, and the great need You have of precious food: By Faith you must on this Lamb feed, And also drink his blood: Or else you shall be sure to die, His Flesh is meat indeed; So is his Blood: O will you try? There's nothing more you need. Ye who do eat his Flesh shall live, And never shall ye die; His Flesh and Blood to you does give, Take it then thankfully, And sing unto the holy Lamb, Sing Praises now therefore: O praise him that he hither came! Sing Praises evermore. HYMN 36. [A Root as God, as Man also] Zech. 3. 8. I will bring forth my Servant, the Branch. Zech. 6. 12. He shall grow out of his place, and shall build the Temple of the Lord. Zech. 6. 13. Even he shall build the Temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall be Priest on the Throne, &amp;c. [The First Part.] A Root as God, as Man also, A Branch here called art; Which does thy humane nature show, To whom God did impart All fulness of the Deity It in this Branch appears; Most precious Fruit we do espy This Branch for ever bears. The Branch is of the self-same kind With the Root of the Tree; The self-same nature we do find That Abraham's Children be Of, thou didst take, that so thereby We might assurance have, That every way thou fitted art Our precious souls to save. A Branch partakes too of the Sap Which in the Root does lye; So in the Virgins Womb was fed Thy blest Humanity. I'th Branch or Branches of the Tree Its glory does shine forth; So 'tis in thee that David's Race Its greatest glory hath. The Second Part. Let Hereticks who do deny Christ of the Virgin took His spotless, pure humanity, Ashamed ever look. And let us all stand in amaze, Whilst we behold and see How God our humane nature has Made one with th'Deity. Now let us sing unto the Man Called the Branch; for he Shall grow and flourish in such sort That never did a Tree. For he upon the Throne does sit, And all the glory bear; And also shall God's Temple build, And make its beauty rare. HYMN 37. [A King, a Priest, and Prophet too] Act. 3. 22. A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you. [The First Part.] A King, a Priest, and Prophet too, Thou art, O Lord indeed; As Mediator art also We such a one did need. Thou art God's mouth, to people all God hath in these last days Spoken to us, 'tis thou dost call, And speak too, many ways. A Prophet speaks not of himself, But as inspired; So God gave thee the Commandment, As we have often read. What thou shouldst speak, and what make known, From thee he nothing hid; By thee to us all things are shown Which God commanded did. The Prophets did thy Kings anoint, So such likewise receive From thee the holy Unction do, Who truly do believe Prophets were to teach Gods good Word In all uprightness too; So thou dost teach us all, O Lord, Yea all things we should do. Yea what, and how we should believe, And how depend on thee; And how to walk, (who Truth receive,) That saved we may be, The Second Part. The Prophets she wed things to come, And so hast thou likewise, Not only in the World that's now, But when the Dead shall rise. How it shall go with thy Saints here, Thou didst to them make known; And how in glory they'll appear, When Sinners are o'rethrown. And he who doth not unto thee In every thing adhere, And do whatever thou dost say, Thy angry frowns must bear. O hearken to this Prophet then In whate're he does say; Fear lest you be all undone Men In the last dismal day. And ye who be the Saints of God, Keep to his Word be sure; Then may you sing, for you shall be Happy, happy for ever. HYMN 38. [We naked once were all, O Lord] Rom. 14. ult. Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, make no provision for the flesh, &amp;c. [The First Part.] We naked once were all, O Lord, And loathsom were to see; Our shame was seen, and vile within, Till cloathed were by thee. 'Tis true, Lord, once in ancient time We gloriously were clad; Our beauty was then in its prime, Not long we so abode, But we were, Lord, beset with Thieves, Who tore our Robes away; And in our blood and nakedness We a long season lay. But thou in mercy didst pass by, And with us fell in love; Though nothing in us could'st espy Affections great to move. Our souls thou didst in the first place Most graciously wash clean; And then didst cloath us with thy grace, Ne're braver Robes were seen. These Garments first by thee were bought, They cost thee very dear; And by thy Spirit they are wrought Most curiously and rare. The Second Part. No Needle-work was e're so fine Bespangled with Gold, As is ihe Robe of Righteousness To all who it behold. Thus is thy grace compared, Lord, With which thou dost adorn The Souls of thy most blessed Saints, VVhose Garments once were torn, And nothing had to cover them, But filthy Rags so vile, That thou our Image didst contemn, Since we thy own did spoil. Thus by our Garments we are known, And those who han't them on, Thou wilt, O Lord, never such own, But bid them to be gone. 'Tis thou hast made the difference, VVe were ill cloath'd as others, But these have not the preference, None like our Elder Brother's: Ay, that is rich, O Lord, indeed, Without least spot or stain; 'Tis that keeps off all fiery darts, And clean it will remain. But these much comfort to us bring, And keep us also warm; We need not fear no pricking thing, Cold can't do us much harm. The Third Part. They ever do their fashion hold Most beautiful and fair; They make all look young when they're old, Such to thee lovely are. The longer we these Garments wear, The better they would be; For the long use of godliness Makes us shine splendentlie. Our Garments then let's not defile, But have them always on; For we must wear them every day, Until our lives are done. And then shall we, Lord, cloathed be With immortality; In Robes that shine like to the Sun, Unto eternity. Come Sinners then, ah! will you buy Some Cloaths to cover you? Most rich they are assuredly, Come, let your own Rags go. VVhat is Morality to Grace? Even like a filthy thing: Get those Robes on, and take your place 'Mongst Children of the King. Ye Saints don't you provision make To satisfie your lust; But put on Christ, your Garments take, Because you ready must Be all, the Bridegroom to attend; He comes, he comes, sing praise; Your Lamps now trim, he will descend, Make haste without delays. HYMN 38. [O Lord we have a mighty Cause] Joh. 2. 2. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. [The First Part.] O Lord we have a mighty Cause, And still it does depend! Ah! we have broke all God's just Laws, VVilt thou our Souls befriend, To take in hand our Cause to plead? Thou art our Advocate; VVe dare not, Lord, lift up our head, Our Case for to relate. But thou ally'd art to the Judge, And for our Souls didst die; The Merits of thy Blood may'st urge, To thee we all do fly. Thou legally art call'd to th'Barr, And hast thy Father's Ear; Alas we all so loathsom be, VVe dare not there appear In our own persons; he is just, And we must guilty be; We righteousness all therefore must Have only, Lord, of thee. Thou never didst miscarry yet On what thou took'st in hand; Our Enemies do thou defeat, That sentence do demand. Hast thou not paid our Debts, O Lord? Read our Discharge we pray, And that will comfort now afford, And this most doubtful day; Is not all paid? Can Justice see Just ground for to deny Our true Acquittance, Lord, in thee VVho didst him satisfie? The second Part. Our Cause, Lord, thou didst undertake Without the hopes of fee; And this does us most chearful make, We hope we now shall see An end put to that bitter strife Which has been long between Our God and us; alas, our life In jeopardy has been. O blessed Lord, we do perceive Our Cause it does go well; For he who doth on thee believe, Shall never go to Hell: But he shall live eternally In joy and happy bliss; Our Advocate has won the day, What love is like to this! Thou in our stead was pleas'd to die, Who Criminals all were, The Law for us didst satisfie, No errours can appear: No superseding of our suit, Our Foes can't it remove; For thou as Judge in chief shalt sit In the high Court above. The Third Part. There's no Appeal from that high Throne, Our Cause being carried there; If Conscience should bring Charges on, Yet there we all stand clear. For though sin does in us abide, It in us shall not reign; And we have Jesus on our side, Who will wash us again. But hear us once ogain; O Lord, Shall we our pardon see, And know that we are justify'd, And peace have all with thee? How sweetly then, Lord, shall we sing, No cause have we to doubt; Therefore we'll leave our Cause with thee, And sing thy Praises out. But O ye Saints take heed of sin; But if that sin you do; An Advocate with God there is, Who pleads always for you. And now poor Sinners will you fly To him with care and speed? This Advocate for you does plead, Who for your Souls did bleed. Though you no money have at all To carry on the Suit; Yet he will be your Advocate, If to him you submit. HYMN 39. [Thou art the Bread of Life, O Lord] Joh. 6. 50. I am the Bread of Life. [The First Part.] Thou art the Bread of Life, O Lord, Bread is a blessed thing; Some Bread to us do thou afford, Shall we lye here starving, When in our Father's House there's store, And we have nought to eat? Remember us, think on the poor, A little broken Meat! Ah! some small Crumbs, Lord, let us have, Which from thy Table fall; A bit of Bread we humbly crave, Or we shall perish all. Bread is the stay and staff of life, 'Tis Bread will do us good; Fill us, O Lord, with holy strife, Till we attain this food. Bread is ordain'd to an high end, The life of Man to save; From Heaven, Lord, thou didst descend, That our poor souls might'st have. That blessing's great; ah! life is sweet, Lord, we must eat or die; And therefore beg now at thy feet, Some Bread do not deny. The second Part. Bread pleasant is unto the taste, To souls who hungry be, This property also thou hast, O it it is found in thee. What can taste sweeter than thy love? O come poor souls and try; That Bread which came down from above Is set before your eye. By Faith you must this Bread behold, And you by Faith must eat; Without true Faith you have been told It is (alas) dry Meat. Bread does renew the strength of Men Who ready are to faint; O then on Christ let's feed agen, Eat Bread poor drooping Saint. On Christ rely, don't look within, On Jesus do depend; 'Tis he has made an end of sin, To him God does thee send. Bread is the best of earthly things, A morsel is worth Gold; From Christ all blessings to us spring, His worth none can unfold. Bread is a portion for the poor, O let us haste away; But see you come to the right door, There may ye feed each day. But what is common Bread to this, Which soon does putrifie? Oh feed on this, none like it is, Eat and ye shall not die. All praise to God, and Christ the Lord, Who Bread to us do give: O sing his praise, Saints, all your days, Eat, and your souls shall live. HYMN 40. [There is a Sun, there is but one] Mal. 4. 2. The Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing under his wings. [The First Part.] There is a Sun, there is but one To light the Universe; Beside thy self, O Lord, there's none Who can enlighten us. Thou art the Fountain of true Light, Nay, all light is from thee; As thou art God omnipotent, Cloathed in Majesty. All light of grace which Saints receive From thee, Lord, does it flow; Few Men who in this world do live, Alas, are lighted so. What clearer is there than the Sun? O what can brighter shine? Thy glory, O most holy One, Exceds, it is divine. Most splendant rays do sparkle forth, Which dazles every eye; Thy beams are brighter than the Sun That shines so gloriously. Thou art the Soul of all the World, By thee all Creatures live; All things together would be hurl'd, If life thou didst not give. We see the Earth and Heaven too, Thou dost uphold them all; If thou should'st once let go thy hold, Together down they'd fall. The second Part. Thou like the Sun communicates Thy glorious influence Of grace and goodness to thy Saints, Thou hast preheminence. What a dark world would this be Were there no Sun to shine? What darkness, Lord, ah! should we see, Had we no beams of thine? 'Tis thou that dost expell away Dark vapours of the night; Thick mists and fogs they all do fly When thou appear'st in sight, Most pow'rfully dost thou expell The darkness that's within; And makes the soul in light to dwell, By vanquishing our sin. Thou mak'st a sweet and lovely day When once thou dost arise; And dries up th'filth that in our way Did lye before our eyes. 'Tis thou who makes a lovely spring; Those things which seemed dead, VVhen thou draw'st near are flourishing, And forth their glories spread. VVithout thy influences, Lord, Thy Veg'atives can't grow; Till thou dost life to us afford, No fruit from us can flow. Let all who on the earth do dwell, Sing with a chearful voice; The praise of Jesus let them tell, And in this Sun rejoyce. The Third Part. O Lord, until that thou dost shine, No heat within have we; All spiritual warmth's from beams of thine, All true joy is from thee. The Sun does heal as well as warm, And when thou dost arise, VVe need not fear no kind of harm From inward enemies. For thy sweet wings fresh healing brings, Our hearts to mollifie; And to those Souls who feel Death's sting, A plaister dost apply. According as the matter is On which the Sun does shine; So doth it always operate, So do those rays of thine To one whose heart thou hast made soft Thy word a favour is Of life unto life, but to some Savour of death 'tis. The Sun doth ripen things we see To bring the harvest on; So we are ripen'd, Lord, by thee, And for thee, every one. Thus do thy glories, Lord, appear, By these things we may know VVhat rare perfections in thee are, And from thee also flow. Therefore thy praises we will sing, Enliv'ned with thy rays; And will exalt our glorious King Until we end our days. HYMN 41. [Thou art the Root from whence we sprung] Rev. 22. 16. I am the Root and Off-spring of David. [The First Part.] Thou art the Root from whence we sprung Who are thy chosen ones; Till we were grafted into thee, We were like to dry bones. The Root of Grace and Nature too Art thou we do espy; Not only Man, but God also, We never will deny The top-stone of thy glory great: All things by thee were made, And at thy word at the last day They all again shall fade. Ah! in this Root what sap is there? The branches shall be fed; Come drooping Saints be of good chear, Lift up with joy your head: You grafted are in such a Root Whose vertue's infinite; Can you want grace, why do you doubt? Such souls God does unite To Jesus Christ; they all shall have From him all fit supply; And unto them, for their support, He nothing will deny. Christ is our Head, Christ is our Root, Christ is our Life also; Christ is your Food, our Sun, our Strength, What have you now to do But live unto his holy name, And sing his praises forth? O raise his glory and his fame Whilst you do live on earth. The Second Part. The Root it does the Body bear, And every Branch therein; Most safe thy Churches Members are, And so have ever been: Because by thee they are sustain'd, Thy Tree shall never fall; It can't be dug up by the root, Our life is hid from all. Like as the root is hid i'th' earth, And life does center there, Even in the Root; so we by Faith Lord see how safe we are In thy own self; none can hurt thee, Nor can they stop the course Of that sweet Sap that feeds our Tree; A blessed intercourse There is between those souls of thine And thy own self, O Lord; We'll never fear what Foes can do, If sap thou dost afford. Let us in thee well rooted be, Our Root is very sound; If we enjoy true unity, Our Fruit will much abound. Because that thou dost always live, Thy Branches shall also; Thou unto us thy life dost give, Thy grace does overflow. Ye righteous in the Lord rejoyce, His holiness proclaim; Be thankful with your hearts and voice, And sing of his great fame. HYMN 43. [Heav'ns glorious Embassador] Mal. 3. 1. The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come up into his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Heav'ns glorious Embassador Is come, is come, be glad, Who blessed news brings from afar, How can ye more be sad? He represents the person clear Of the most mighty King; And blessed news he does declare, And tydings with him bring. His Commission great has sealed been, His journey long has took: He's come, he's come we say agen, Him for whom you did look. And terms of peace poor Sinners now May have, which easie be; Before the dreadful God then bow, And leave iniquity. The white Flag of Mercy is out, The Banner is display'd; Come Sinners now and look about, And longer been't afraid. Gods wrath is o're in Jesus Christ, If to him you do flye, You shall not bear eternal wrath, O then on him rely. Among the gods, O Lord, is none With thee to be compar'd, Thou peace extends, O holy One, The like hath not been heard. The second Part. Nay more than this, Christ comes to treat About a Marriage too: His love to Sinners, O 'tis great, For he makes known to you That glorious, high and bless'd design Of the Great God above, Which is to take that soul of thine Into contract of love. Behold the mighty Prince of Peace, Whose glories does excell; He looks on you, and loves you so, That he with you would dwell. O cast your eyes on him with speed, Come Virgins fall in love, Don't take another in his stead, Whose 'ffections in him move Towards such souls as yours, alas, Though ne're so vile within; If once this thing does come to pass, He'll take away your sin. Then look to him by Faith and Prayer, O cast a single eye, And close with him this very day, He with you will comply. Now let's sing and praise the Lord, VVho did Christ Jesus send, To proclaim peace, and love afford, Praise him world without end. The Third Part. Hark, hark, the Trumpet sounds, look out, The Embassador of Heav'n Proclaims a peace, without all doubt Attendance must be given. Lay down your arms, his terms are good, O cease this wicked war; You have too long, alas, withstood Heav'ns bless'd Embassador. He will not wait on you always, If you do not comply, You will e're long see bloody days, For all of you must die. VVhilst you oppose such mercy great, VVhat wretches are you all; You summon'd are to th'Judgment Seat, O great will be your fall, If quickly now you don't submit, He's ready to be gone: O loath your selves, lye at his feet, From all your folly turn. The bloody Flag you soon shall see Put forth in dreadful wrath; If still his call rejected be, No place for you on Earth, But you to Hell with vengeance must Be turned every one; And from God's presence be accurst, Ah this now think upon; And say you have a gracious call, And happy you may be, If you lay hold on Gospel-terms, A pardon you shall see. [H]YMN 44. [In regions of approachless light] Heb. 1. 2. Whom he hath appointed Heir of all things. [The First Part.] In regions of approachless light There sits th'eternal King; VVherein mixt joys with love unites, From whom all riches spring. There dost thou sit on thy high Throne, And all subject to thee; Yea, and all worlds, Lord, are thine own, And what else there can be. A Son thou hast also brought forth (VVho is thy only Heir) Begotten long before the Earth Or Heavens did appear. He is thy joy and hearts delight, By whom all things were made; He always stands in thy own sight, VVhose glories ne're shall fade. And as he makes thy heart full glad, So all perfections meet In him who is with glory clad, VVhose love is ever sweet. He is thine Heir, into his hand All things, Lord, thou hast given, That so he might have sole command O're Earth and also Heaven. He's cloathed with such dignity, Has such a glorious name, That he's above each Monarchy, There's none dares once lay claim To his Titles; each Seraphim Do readily submit; The Cherubims do worship him, And fall down at his feet. The Second Part. 'Tis Christ, and only Christ does bear Thy likeness in each thing; Thy express Image doth appear In this our glorious King. 'Tis thou, bless'd Jesus, who dost raise Thy Father's House so high; The stress of all on thee he lays, Of his whole Family. In thee all treasures hidden are Of grace and wisdom too; And all because thou art his Heir, From thee all riches flow. Thou portions therefore dost give forth To all given to thee, VVho witness do all the new birth, And Sons adopted be; And so made Heirs, and shall possess VVith thee a glorious share Of that eternal blessedness Of which thou art the Heir. All things were thine as thou art God, But unto thee are given (As thou the Mediator art) By the great God of Heaven. O how art thou, Lord, honoured, Who would not fall in love With thee whose glories thus are spread Below, also above. O happy choice ye Saints have made, Who marry'd have the Heir; Soon ye shall the possession have, And glorious all appear. Then never doubt of all supply, Ye precious Saints of his; He will you no good thing deny, What happiness like this. O then with a melodious voice Together do ye sing, Since he has made of you his choice, Praise ye the glorious King. HYMN 45. [O Holy God, we thee adore] Rev. 1. 5. And from Jesus, who is the true Witness. [The First Part.] O Holy God, we thee adore, Who glorious truths makes known; And that of them we might not doubt, But stedfastly them own. A glorious Witness thou hast sent, Who from thy bosom came, And he himself also does say, I the true Witness am. But what dost thou, O blessed Prince, Bear witness now unto? Ah! 'tis of that eternal love Which from the Lord does flow. And of that great and good design Of saving each poor soul, By Blood and Merits Lord of thine, Who do upon thee roul; And know in thee all truth is found, Who the Messia art; And that grace does in thee abound To each believing heart. To the true Witness now above We ought therefore to sing, And always to admire his love, From whence all comforts spring. The Second Part. A Witness faithful, Lord, and true; He sometimes others brings As witnesses with him to shew And open divers things. The holy Prophets we do find, Who were, O Lord, of old, Bear witness, and were of one mind, Thy Record to unfold. And God the Father from on high, With an amazing voice Did record bear assuredly, Whose witness is most choice. The Spirit also bears record These three agree in one, And testifie to every word Delivered by the Son. The Miracles which Jesus wrought, They also witness bear To whatsoever he made known, Or did to us declare. Then tremble ye who wicked be, Escape ye never shall, If ye believe not Christ is he, With vengeance you shall fall: And in your sins you all shall die, This is the true Witness said; But all ye Saints rejoyce and sing, For all your debts are pay'd. HYMN 46. [A witness must his witness bear] The Third Part. A witness must his witness bear Unto the Truth; nay he Must the whole truth likewise declare In all simplicity. And nothing but the truth must speak, And speak it plainly too, A true decision clear to make, All this, Lord, thou dost do. Whatever is a truth of God, VVhich we ought to obey, In thy New Testament 'tis found, VVe all the stress must lay Upon thy faithfulness: O Lord, Canst thou a truth pass by, 'Not witness to it in thy VVord, Or let it darkly lye Therein conceal'd, when 'tis a thing Of such a great concern, That Men do say with greatest care Each Soul is bound to learn? Or if they don't it strictly keep, To Judgment they must come: Nay threaten such who it neglect VVith an eternal doom. Ah! let them blush with greatest shame, VVe to thy VVord appeal, VVho the true VVitness art, and know Thou didst no truth conceal. The fourth Part. Now when a thing does doubtful lye, And Men cannot agree; VVhen what one says, others deny, VVe presently should flee To thee the true and faithful One; If to that very thing No witness thou hast plainly born, Away we must it fling. Art thou the only VVitness, Lord, To ev'ry Truth divine, And not one word for such a thing Out of that mouth of thine? And yet can that a truth be thought, They other VVitness bring; They call for Moses, he is brought To witness to this thing. And thus they, Lord, do thee degrade, Or do invaluate The Highest VVitness e're was heard, Or Matters did relate. Moses was not for evermore VVithin the House to be; He spoke on Earth, but thou from Heaven, No Law-giver but thee, Lord, can we own, since all power is To thee alone given; And all thy Laws they are firm as The Ordinance of Heaven. The Fifth Part. No Tabernacle here's for him, Appears to every one VVhose eyes are open, if they look They'll find that he is gone: None, none but Jesus does remain, What can there be more clear? God calls to us too out of Heaven, Him only now to hear. Besides, if Moses should come in, Their Cause he'd give away; He never gave that Law to them Who live i'th' Gospel day: 'Twas given unto Israel When they in Horeb were; Not to their Fathers, but to them, Doth eminent appear; Deut. 5. 1, 2, 3. To Jews and Jewish Proselites, Or all within their Gate; But not to them without their Church Did that at all relate. The truth, as 'tis in Jesus, we Ought only to receive; And such who do not, we may see Themselves they do deceive. The Sixth Part. A Witness ought for to be one That is indifferent, Not byassed to either side, Therefore God has thee sent To be a Witness in our Case; To us thou art of kin; And equally related art Likewise too unto him. We therefore have no cause at all Against thee to except, But on thy witness stand or fall, If Cast, we must subject Unto the Judge of Heaven and Earth, We silent all shall be, If thou against us dost come forth, And cast we are by thee. Unto the truth witness to bear Thou cam'st, Lord, from afar, And wilt against Sinners appear When they come to the Barr: At the last day if they are found In bonds of unbelief, Or have their hearts false and unsound, They'll tremble like the Thief: Against the false Professor thou Wilt then thy witness bear, And with notorious Sinners then They shall of Judgment share. The Seventh Part. All thy whole mind and counsel is Either by thee or thine Own blest Apostles plainly known, There is no truth divine But it in Precepts may be found, Or Presidents to lye; For both these are our rule, and of Equal authority. A Witness ends each doubtful case Which long sometimes depend; So thou wilt also very plain Each doubtful matter end. A Witness doth his witness give, If it be just and true To righteousness, to undeceive Such which before he knew To be false Men, and wittingly The matter would evade; But so their evidence does try, A stop to all is made. So thou, O Lord, to righteouness Thy witness dost bring in, That all false Souls who are deceiv'd By Satan or by sin, Shall be convinc'd, and silent be By thy own faithful word; And all their foolish Pleas they'll see No help will them afford. The Eighth Part. Thou, Lord, dost say there's life in thee For all who do believe; And that all such shall certainly Free pardon then receive: Nay more than this we do espy Thou dost bear witness too, That all who don't repent truly, To Hell at last shall go. And if Men are not born again, Whoever, Lord, they be, They under wrath shall all remain, And not God's Kingdom see. Thou, Lord, a Witness art for those Who unto truth adhere, And with thee do sincerely close; But such that Rebels are, And thy Record do not receive, Against all such we know Thou wilt thy dreadful witness give, And then to Hell they go: But yet this witness joy does bring To such who godly be; Ah! he will keep you to the end, That glory you may see. To God the Father, and the Son, And Holy Ghost therefore, Be glory, honour and renown Now and for evermore. HYMN 47. [Thy name, O Lord, is wonderful] Isa. 9. 6. His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Thy name, O Lord, is wonderful, And wonderful thou art; We stand amaz'd and wonder do, And so does ev'ry heart That hath a saving sight of thee, They all are in a maze Whilst they behold thy majesty, God does to glory raise. Thy Name, O that is Wonderful, So is thy Nature too; Thy Saints do marvel, well they may, For Angels wonder do; They see with strange astonishment: Should Heaven and Earth combine To search out thy perfections great, Them can they never find To such degree as, Lord, in thee They gloriously do shine: Strange was thy Birth, all Saints on Earth Cry thou art all divine. All praise and glory now therefore We unto thee do sing, And do resolve yet more and more To magnifie our King. The Second Part. Is't not a Wonder a Woman, As Holy Writ does say, Should in such sort compass a Man, Who with Man never lay? To see him whom the World did make, Of a poor Virgin born! To see him who was God most high, Left like to one forlorn! To see the Heir of both the Worlds In a base Manger lye; And Blessedness itself to be Doomed to misery! To see the Ancient of all days, A Babe of a day old! To see one Person God and Man The wonder doth unfold! He that the Heir of all things was, VVhom Angels honoured, Is now so mean and poor that he Has no place to lay's head. Unto thy name so Wonderful Be glory now therefore; O let us look and wonder still! Yea, wonder evermore. The Third Part. The wonders of thy Life were much, Strange wonders in thy Death; The wonders of thy Blood are such, It all astonish'd hath. Thy Power's great and wonderful, Strange wonders in thy Love; Great wonders we do see below, But stranger are above. Let's look, and love, and wonder still, Till we are ravished; Our hearts with grace, Lord, do thou fill, So shall thy fame be spread By us: And whilst we wonder do, Let's think upon that day VVhen greater wonders out will flow To do all sin away: And when to the great wonderment Thou wilt in glory come, With all thy mighty Angels too, To carry us all home, Then shalt thou be admired By all thy Children dear, And they with thee (as it is said) In glory shall appear. HYMN 48. [A Counsellor, ye and the chief] Isa. 9. 6. Wonderful, Counsellor. [The First Part.] A Counsellor, ye and the chief, Most wonderful art thou; For we do see (for to be brief) All things, Lord, thou dost know. None understand all Rites and Laws But, Lord, thy self alone, And soon canst thou find out what flaws There is in any one. All secrets of State is with thee, Thou know'st thy Father's Will, And agitates all things below With strange and wondrous skill. 'Tis thou must counsel give to us, Thy counsel it is good, But woe be unto all those souls Thy counsels have withstood. O then for counsel, Lord, let's come To thee continually, And to thy praise sing all our days Until we come to die. The Second Part. A matter, Lord, of sharp contest Betwixt two Parties were, And God hath thee alone invest To make the matter clear. Man stands charged by the great God, As worthy is to die For Treason, which notorious is Against his Majesty: But there's a Friend from Heaven come Who in our stead does say, That he will bear the Sinners doom, And all his debts defray. Now will it stand in sacred Laws, 'Tis thou our Counsel art, Can Justice find, Lord, any flaws? Thy judgment now impart: Will it hold good i'th' Court above, That guilty Sinners may This way be freed? Can this remove And take their guilt away? Can God be just, and yet forgive? O bring thy sense now in! Can we acquittance, Lord, receive, And pardon'd be of sin By righteousness another wrought, And death which he did die? Can guilty Man from guilt be freed? Can that him justifie? To end this Cause thou didst come here, The Matter's left to thee; And thou dost say the Sinner's clear This way, and so shall be. The Third Part. Lord he that doth on thee rely, And union does obtain; And to thy righteousness does fly, He's freed from every stain Of sin and guilt in sight of God, And justify'd is he, Though on his soul may lye a load, Because he cannot see That pardon and that freedom yet That's in thy self alone; But pores on his iniquity, Which he finds is not gone Off his own Conscience, but does feel 'Body of sin and death; Yet thou to him this truth does seal, That he a pardon hath. Wherefore thy holy praises great All Ages shall record; Thy people shall give thanks to thee For evermore, O Lord. The Fourth Part. We are about a great Estate, An assurance fain would have; The way to us do thou relate, Thy counsel we do crave: The Title's good, that's not the thing We do enquire about, But how to settle it on us, And lasting Deeds sue out, That none us disinherit may, Thy counsel give, O Lord! O shew to us the ready way, According to thy Word! 'Tis thou must seal to us the Lease, O let it be for ever! Thy Spirit is the Seal, let us The same of thee procure. Lord, let the Title firmly stand, Unto thy Servants thus Confirm the matter took in hand, That grace may shine in us. The Fifth Part. We charged with sad crimes all are, Such misdemeanors vile, If thou dost not the matter clear, Our comforts they will spoil. The Law and Conscience both agree To lay, Lord, at our door The highest Treason that can be: Call thou the matrer o're, Acquit us of this fearful charge, Thou able art to plead The Merits of thy Blood at large, Thereby 'tis we are freed. O when our Cause is good, 'tis thou That on our side dost stand; No bad Cause thou we well do know Wilt ever take in hand. O 'tis a blessed thing indeed We interest have in thee; No counsel shall we ever need, If we will ruled be. To the high Court thou dost belong, There thou chief Counsel art; And thou wilt save us from all wrong, And good advice impart. Ye righteous in the Lord rejoyce, His holiness proclaim; Be thankful, and with heart and voice Praise ye his glorious Name. The Sixth Part. Into the presence of the King Thou hast admittance, Lord, And nothing doth he hide from thee; Nay more, at thy own word What e're we ask, or is our suit, If we do but believe; If it be things thou dost think fit, We shall the same receive. Thy counsel it shall stand we know, What Enemies design Thou quickly canst quite overthrow, And save that Church of thine. And now all you that counsel need, Repair unto this Friend, His counsel ne're reject be sure Which to you he does send. O buy of him that precious Gold, (White Rayment then get on,) And blessed Eye-salve, to behold This glorious, lovely One: And by his counsel be you led Until you come to die, Then shall you sing with crowned heads Unto eternity. HYMN 49. [We have, O Lord, a House to raise] 1 Cor. 3. 11. Another Foundation can no Man lay, but that which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ. [The First Part.] We have, O Lord, a House to raise, And would have it stand sure, And never know the least decays, But firm abide for ever: And that we might thus build our souls Thou the Foundation art; Here build we must our House, O Lord, The whole and ev'ry part. God hath himself in mercy great This sure Foundation laid, That so to build our hopes on thee We might not be afraid. Thy Church on this Foundation is Most firmly built also; From hence it is that Men cannot, Nor Devils it o'rethrow. A Foundation's laid by knowing Men, Some skilful Architect; But this Foundation thou hast laid, As wisdom did direct. Yea, th'wisdom of the Trinity I'th' Council held above; And mercy was, Lord, in thine eye, 'Twas bowels did thee move To bring this Stone, so choice and pure, Beyond the rarest Gold, To lay us a Foundation sure Most glorious to behold. To the Foundation now therefore We will together sing, To raise the praise for evermore Of God and Christ our King. 'Twas deeply layd in thy Decree, No bottom can be found; So deep, Lord, all thy counsels be, We in them, Lord, are drown'd. The second Part. What kind of House thou didst intend To build, we may perceive If the Foundation we observe, And not our selves deceive, It is a Precious-stone we see, No Jasper is so rare, And all the Building ought to be As precious, lovely, fair. All Gold and Silver, Precious-stones, No Wood, Hay nor Stubble; And living ones they must be all, Believers meek and humble. As the Foundation doth uphold The whole Fabrick; Thou dost bear up each Stone, O Lord, All Members to thee stick: Each Soul thou dost unite to thee In sure bonds of Love; O there's a blessed harmony 'Mong Saints born from above. Without this safe Foundation, Lord, No Building's there at all; If any do not on thee build, Their Souls and hopes will fall: Yet shall the Just in thee rejoyce, Who trust, Lord, in thy might; They shall Praise sing with mind and voice Whose hearts with thee are right. The Third Part. Other Foundations may decay, Or Men may dig them down; But this doth stand like to a Rock, It can't be overthrown. Let Devils do whate're they can They can't it undermine: Art thou built here, O happy Man! Great safety shalt thou find: Here build your Faith, your Hope, and all Your Comforts too likewise; Then let Winds blow, ye never shall Fall by your Enemies. But woe to such who lay aside This precious Corner-stone, And build on works through their great pride, Their hopes will soon be gone. All build do on the Sands besure, Or no Foundation have, Who don't true Faith of God procure, Their precious Souls to save. O blessed Sion thou art strong, For God hath founded thee Upon a Rock, that none can wrong, Thou ruin'd canst not be. The Gates of Hell shall not prevail, So firmly thou dost stand: Ye Saints, how can your courage fail Too on the other hand. Come sing with joy to Christ therefore, And on him do depend; The Top-stone and Foundation's he, O sing world without end. HYMN 50. [Thy Bowels unto Sinners, Lord] Matth. 23. 37. How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings. [The First Part.] Thy Bowels unto Sinners, Lord, Is shewed by the Hen, Who in her care of all her young Doth far exceed some Men. How will she fly into the face Of such who would destroy Her pretty Brood! she can't endure They should them once annoy. But ah! thy bowels far exceed All Creatures here below; For thou for Sinners, Lord, didst bleed, Compassion great to show. The Hen herself to weakness brings Whilst of her young takes care, How does she scratch and strive each day To feed them here and there? But, Lord, thou brought'st thy self so low That we might all be fed, That in the grave a while didst lye After that thou wast dead: And as a Hen does cluck and call According to her kind, Thereby to save her Chickens all From Kites, which she does find Do often of them make a prey, So dost thou call and cry To Sinners, whilst it is to day, Whom thou dost, Lord, espy To be in danger by their sin And Devils many ways; Nay, thou dost call and call agen Full oft, for many days. The Second Part. The Hen stands ready and prepar'd, Hov'ring her mournful wings, And never is she satisfy'd Till under them she brings: So thou dost spread thy Arms, O Lord, Poor Sinners to bring in, And bids the weary come to thee Who laden are with sin. O then come in ye Sinners all Under Christ's wings with speed, He will receive you great and small, And nothing shall you need. And O how safe are you his Saints! Under his wings you lye; Then fear no hurt from outfard Foes, Nor inward Enemy. They who are wise will certainly In mind these things record, And so they will with ease espy The kindness of the Lord. HYMN 51. [Thou like as a Refiner doth] Mal. 3. 3. He shall sit as a Refiners fire. [The First Part.] Thou like as a Refiner doth The Gold and Silver try, We had much dross until thou didst Our Souls, Lord, purifie. Into the Furnace we were cast, Which oft is very hot; 'Tis not our Grace i'th'least to waste, But filth which we have got. Afflictions like as fire doth The Gold rarely refine, Purge all our Souls, and we thereby More gloriously may shine: But Dross will not the Fire bear, So some, Lord, cannot stand Before thee when thou dost rise up To scourge them with thy hand. The fire makes the Gold more soft, So by Afflictions we More plyable, O Lord, are brought To yield and bend to thee. The Second Part. Gold when 'tis triy'd, 'tis pure made By the Refiners art; So by afflictions thou dost, Lord, Mor'e holy make each heart. From hence we may the reason see Why God afflictions brings, And clearly also may discern What profit from them springs. We fitted are hereby, O Lord, For our own Master's turn, Who golden Vessels will make us Before that he has done. When you refin'd by tryals are, What cause have you to sing, And praise the Lord that ever he Did you in's Furnace fling. HYMN 52. [The Eagle is the King of Birds] Exod. 19. 4. I bore you on Eagles wings. The Eagle is the King of Birds, Ah! who is like to thee Who is so strong? or hath an Eye So quick, and far to see? Like to an Eagle thou dost mount, Or didst ascend on high, Not only up unto the Clouds, But far above the skie: And as the Eagle thou dost bear Upon thy blessed Wings All thy poor Saints, and they hereby Forget all earthly things; They soar so high sometimes, O Lord, Born upon Wings of Love, That Earth to them seems a small thing, They dwell so high above: And as the Eagle's way's not known Who mounts up in the Air, Ev'n so thy love and wisdom both Most deep and hidden are. O fly ye Saints your selves to hide Under Almighty Wings, And safe you'll be whate're betide, When God sore judgments brings. O see Christ's care, and do not fear, But sing his Praises forth; His grace and love's beyond compare, None like him here on Earth. HYMN 53. [Thou art our Captain General] Heb. 2. 10. To make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through sufferings. [The First Part.] Thou art our Captain General, Thy Commission sealed is; Rouze up ye Soldiers great and small, No Captain like to this. Thou hast the power given thee To raise a mighty Host, And thou beats up to bring them in Daily from every Coast. 'Tis thou dost nominate who shall Have office under thee, And they Commissions have likewise Who rightly entred be. Thou hast thy Soldiers names set down In thy own Muster-roll, Within the blessed Book of Life Is written every Soul: And out of that sweet Book of thine They shall not blotted be, If they are such thy Father hath Lord Jesus given to thee. Unto our Captain General A new Song let us sing; For he that Captain is in Chief Is our God, and our King. The second Part. Thou dost, Lord Christ, thy Soldiers lead, Before them didst thou go; All Foes by thee are vanquished, Thou didst triumph also Over them all most gloriously, And perfect now art made, Has Captive took Captivity, We'll never be afraid, But stand unto our Arms always, No Quarter we will give; If thou art with us all our days, Few Enemies shall live. Let us be well disciplined, And very skilful be, And in right paths and foot-steps tread, And truly follow thee. No Captain doth his Men advance To such high dignity; For each shall have preheminence To sit on Thrones with thee. O then let us lift up our head O happy Israel, Christ's Banner over you is spread, Your glory shall excell. The Third Part. Thou giv'st the Word too of Command, What 'tis that we must do; But never bidst us still to stand, Nor backward for to go. We never must, Lord, wheel about, Nor be as once we were; But forward march with courage stout, Without all dread or fear. Let's take Example, Lord of thee, Resist ev'n unto Blood Before yield to iniquitiy, Which has us oft withstood. 'Tis thou hast power to cashier All such thou dost not like, If any false-hearted appear, Their names out thou wilt strike. No Warriers like to thee in fight, Thy power and thy skill Are both of them ev'n infinite, Who then engage thee will? If any should, woe to them all If once thou draws thy Sword, And in thy wrath on them dost fall, They die shall then, O Lord. The Fourth Part. Come in, come in, and list your selves, You shall have present pay, Your Souls shall be with grace well stor'd, Your charges to defray. 'Tis th'ready way to become great And rich, will you come in? The Trumpets sound, and Drums do beat To war against your sin. Will you be on our Captains side? Ah! if you still stand out, His Sword e're long will you divide VVith them that turn about: For if Deserters there be found, Better not to be born, His wrath to such will so abound, To pieces they'll be torn. Ye Saints your Leader follow close, And see that you do keep To the Company you have chose, And from them do not slip. Lest you Deserters should be thought, Keep then your place be sure In that same Truth to which you're brought, Lest wrath you do procure. HYMN 54. [The Morning Star it does appear] Rev. 22. 16. I am the bright &amp; morning-star. The Morning Star it does appear, The day approaches now; See how Christ shines! how lovely, fair! O cast your eyes, see how His light does sparkle brighter still, The day will quickly break, And until then he guide us will I'th' way that we should take. None is so glorious in our sight As the sweet Morning-Star; Ah! thou out-shines it, art more bright Than all the Angels far. The Morning-Star, that name is sweet, So is that name of thine; O with thy glorious beams let's meet, For they are all divine. In Winter 'tis the Morning-Star Is so delighted in; How good's thy Light, whilst we do find The Clouds and Night of Sin! The Morning Stars did all rejoyce When this Star did arise; O let us with the Churches sing His lasting praise likewise. HYMN 55. [Ye Saints about you look with speed] Rev. 16. 15. Behold I come as a Thief. Ye Saints about you look with speed, Christ's coming does draw near; O watch with care, and take great heed, As a Thief he will appear: Not like a Thief unrighteously To do Men any wrong, But unawares most suddenly, Though many think 'tis long. Like as a Thief comes in the night VVhen people are all still, And puts them all into a fright, So thy dread coming will Surprize the Earth, and all who sleep, How will they quake with fear! O Sinners then will cry and weep When thou, Lord, dost appear: Then will they seek some place to hide Themselves from the great God; But though they can't his wrath abide, Yet will they find no shroud Nor cover which can shelter them From his most angry frown; For vengeance shall their Souls consume, And quickly bring them down. The coming of a Thief you may Prevent by taking care, But, Lord, thy coming to prevent No way at all is there. But will he come, and quickly too? Ye Saints rejoyce and sing, Your glory then will overflow Like to lasting Spring. HYMN 56. [There is enough in Christ to fill] Hag. 2. 7. The desire of all Nations shal come. There is enough in Christ to fill All Nations of the Earth; The Nations never will be still Until he shall come forth. Some in all Nations long for peace, Therefore desire thee; And wars, O Lord shall never cease Until the Prince they see. The Nations long for some great thing, Their desires are for good; And all true good from thee does spring, Though not well understood. All Nations now desire thee not, Yet some do in each Land; And all the Earth for thee will thirst, And yield to thy command. All those who see of thee a need, Know the necessity They have of help, their Souls do bleed Until thee they do see. O then Lord Jesus come away, We know thou didst appear Already once, but do not stay, Again lets see thee here. HYMN 57. [In thee, O Lord, true peace is found] Isa. 9. 6. Prince of Peace, &amp;c. In thee, O Lord, true peace is found, Our peace O thou didst make, Which lasting is, and shall abound In thee, and for thy sake. Thou hast the power of a Prince, Nay Peace thou canst command; O're War thou hast preheminence, Canst stop it with thy hand. If thou dost once but speak the word, Peace we shall have within; By thy own Spirit thou canst, Lord, Destroy each cursed sin. Thou to our Souls sweet peace dost give, Thy Church has peace from thee; How happily do all such live Who filled with it be! The Nations, Lord, will ne're have peace Until thou dost appear; Thou wilt make Wars, O Lord to cease Far off, and also near. Bless'd days of peace will be e're long, We therefore, Lord, will sing, And quickly shall too a new Song Unto our glorious King. HYMN 58. [He's come, he's come, the Throne is set] Act. 10. 42. He that was ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and Dead. He's come, he's come, the Throne is set, The Trumpets sound aloud, Behold the thousands at his feet, O see the mighty crowd. Great is this day, great is the throng, Millions of millions stand; And all that thought this day was long, They are on his Right-hand: But O the millions, millions who Are on his Left-hand plac'd, Ah, see how they now tremble do! How wan, and how pale-fac'd They now appear! Ah, now they see Their folly, but too late! They now with grief tormented be To see their woful state! The Trumpet sounds exceeding high, The Cherubs clap their wings; O hear the Saints melodiously With all the Angels sing! But hark, the Books are called for! Ah, Christ is on the Throne! The wicked now how do they cry! O hark how they do groan! HYMN 59. [Thou, Lord, art the high Judge] The Second Part. Sing this as the 25th. Psalm. Thou, Lord, art the high Judge, Most righteous art also; And all the world must judged be, And their rewards have too. Impartially proceed Wilt thou in that great day, And every Man's Indictment read, And hear what they can say. The honour of the Lord, The mighty God above, Thou seekst to raise, and now thou wilt All doubts of Men remove. Now all the works of men, And thoughts of every heart Shall unto Judgment come, and then Shall all have their deserts: The Books shall open be Of Law and Gospel too, And Conscience shall be call'd upon To charge, or clear also. All deeds of darkness shall Be brought unto the light; For nothing can be hid at all From the great Judge's sight. O think upon this day, And for it now prepare; For quickly Christ will come away, Who will no Sinners spare. The Third Part. How dreadful is a righteous Judge To such who guilty be! But none like thee, O holy One, Cloathed in Majesty. Thy Countenance how will it shine Much brighter than the Sun; All wicked ones will weep and pine, And see themselves undone: Conscience will in that dreadful day The guilty Sinner fright, And all his deeds before him lay Done by him day or night. None shall be suffer'd there to speak Or answer for his Friend, But every one must for himself His own state recommend: The Witnesses shall be call'd in, And many will appear, And God himself he will be one, Who all things knows most clear. Conscience also shall called be His witness in to give, Who next to God all things does see, And knows how Men do live. Angels likewise both good and bad Their Evidence may bring, Who quick inspection always had Of Men in every thing. The Fourth Part. No mercy then for guilty ones, The Judge will be severe; Christ will not mind the Sinners groans, Who wicked have been here. This is the only time of Grace, 'Tis now Men must repent, When that day comes, there is no place, Although they may relent. The Wicked shall the Sentence hear, Depart ye cursed all; And being bound up hands and feet, In flaming fire must fall: And ever there too shall they lye, The fire can not go out; And their worm never more shall die, Which will be fad no doubt. O then poor Sinners lay to heart Your folly, to Christ fly; And leave thy sins, whoe're thou art, For that day draweth nigh. The Fifth Part. O Sing ye Saints, you have a Friend Who for you will appear If you are faithful to the end Whilst you do now live here, Christ, when he comes, will clear you all, And wipe all tears away; And ye shall sing, and triumph shall In glorious array: Ye shall the happy Sentence hear, O Come ye blessed Ones, The blessed of my Father dear, And take your glorious Crowns. This being so, ye Saints break forth And say, O Come away, O blessed Judge of Heaven and Earth! O haste, and do not stay. HYMN 60. [Of Garments there's necessity] Mat. 22. 11, 12. And he said unto him, Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on a Wedding-garment? [The First Part.] Of Garments there's necessity, Since sin at first came in; We needed none when Innocent, We naked were by sin: So a righteousness we must have all, Sinners all naked be; We lost our Cloaths by Adam's Fall, Must now be cloath'd by thee. A Garment covereth our shame, Sin is a filthy thing; Thou to hide it, [Lord] hither came, Thy Robe's a covering. Thy Righteousness is that Robe too Which hides all filth within; Such shall no shame for ever know, Who have no stain of sin. Thy Righteousness is spotless, pure, And thou dost it impute To us, O Lord, we have it sure, And well it doth us suit: For nothing but this Garment could Make us accepted be; None justified ever shall Without it be by thee: But every one that hath this on They justified are, And therefore let Believers sing Who this rich Robe do wear. The Second Part. A Garment must exactly fit Such who do put it on; Thy Righteousness alone is it That suits each gracious One. In every case the Law has all It can desire to have, And Justice says she never shall More of Believers crave: It suits so well in each degree, And Saints also do find It suits them so, nothing can be Exacter to their mind: For it does with God's wisdom suit, And cloaths our souls and heart; And hides all our deformities, Nay covers every part, From head to foot, so that such seem To have no spot at all; It gloriously does fit all them, Be they great ones or small. The Third Part. A Wedding-garment is a sign Of joy and sweet delight, And so that righteousness of thine Is, Lord, in our own sight: In it we do rejoyce always, 'Tis this which makes us glad; Such may rejoyce well all their days Who are so bravely clad. A Wedding-Garment 'tis also Richly Embroidered, No Princess e're was cloathed so That King did ever wed: It shines bespangled with Gold, And such who have it on The King with joy does them behold, And loves to look upon. How may we then continually In Jesus Christ rejoyce! And sing to him melodiously With heart and chearful voice! The Fourth Part. All who did unto Weddings come Amongst the Jews of old, Must all have Wedding-Garments on The Bridegroom to behold: So ev'ry Soul who cloath'd is not With Christ's bless'd righteousness, Shall be asham'd at the last day, And then be quite speechless. This Garment serves for every use, And cannot get a stain; We need not fear the least abuse, It saves from hurt and pain: 'Tis Armour-proof unto the heart, Its worth is infinite, It saves us from each fiery Dart Of Satan's, day and night. O then poor Sinners will you see This Garment to obtain? 'Twill cover your iniquity, And leave in you no stain; That in God's sight you shall appear Lovely to look upon; Without it you undone all are, And perish shall each one: But let the Saints rejoyce and sing, For their infirmities Are all past over by the King, Though many evils lies Open to them, whilst inwardly They on their sins do pore, But shortly all their sins shall fly, And seen be never more. HYMN 61. [Ah what art thou, Lord Jesus, then?] Col. 3. 11. But Christ is all in all, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Ah what art thou, Lord Jesus, then? VVhat can we speak or shall? Thou art unto all godly Men Even their all in all. Thou all in first Creation wast, All things were made by thee, And all things for thee too were made, VVhatever, Lord, they be. And thou all things dost now uphold, Of all things dost dispose; Thou wast before all things of old, And dost all things disclose. Thou Heir also of all things art, All things are given thee; And all things dost to such impart VVho call'd and chosen be. The substance of all shadows too The Antitype, likewise Of all the Types we read of do, VVho would thee then not prize? The Second Part. In our Redemption thou art all, Thou didst attonement make; Thou purchass'd grace for great and small, All have it for thy sake. In our Election thou art he, From whence to us it springs; And also we were chose in thee, VVhich so much comfort brings. In Satisfaction we do find Thou all in all art; so 'Twas in thy own Eternal Mind Grace on us to bestow. According to thine own purpose VVe all too called be, Grace never had took hold on us Had it not been through thee. In Justification thou art all, For 'tis in thee alone VVe righteousness have since the Fall, Besides thine there is none. In Sanctification thou likewise Art all in all, O Lord; In thee alone this Blessing lies, And by thy Holy VVord And Spirit we are all made clean, New habits from thee flow; And all that ever wash'd have been, To thee they owe it do. The Third Part. Our Acceptation is in thee, O thou beloved One; No Soul shall e're accepted be, But through thy Blood alone: And all in our Salvation then Thou art in every thing, Thou hast the Author of it been, And grace from thee does spring. By thee we all are quickned, And rais'd to life again, VVho in our sins all once lay dead, But now in life remain. And in Regeneration Ah! thou art all in all; We are renewed by the Son, 'Tis thou who dost install Each Soul in that high dignity That waits on the new birth; We were begotten, Lord, by thee, And by thee are brought forth. The Fourth Part. In ev'ry Ordinance also In which we should be found O thou art all; for we well know Grace in thee doth abound. The Sacraments do hold thee forth, And witness bear to thee; And we by one to see by Faith Thou nail'd was to the Tree; Thy Body broke, and Blood was shed; In Baptism we espy Thou in the Grave wast covered, But long thou didst not lye: But as the Body raised is That cover'd was all o're, So thou wast raised unto life, And diest now no more. In Prayer and Preaching thou art all, What do we preach save thee? 'Tis on thy Name we also call, And for thy sake have we Whatever we do need or want, We by thy Spirit cry, And through thy Incense ev'ry Saint Receives a full supply. What is there more? What can we do, But in the great'st amaze To stand and think, and evermore Sing forth thy worthy praise. HYMN 62. [Lord, from the Father thou art all] Christ all from the Father, to the Father, with the Father. [The Fifth Part.] Sing this as the 100dth. Psalm. Lord, from the Father thou art all And to the Father art the same, And with the Father; when we call We have all things, and in thy Name All from the Father thou didst take, Which to us thou art pleas'd to give; Thou cam'st our Souls alive to make, We from thy self that life receive. Thou to the Father the way art, The truth and life are all in thee; Unless thou dost thy help impart, The blessed Father we can't see. All with the Father art besure, Thou hast always thy Father's Ear; Thou Favour with him dost procure, When we to him thro' thee draw near. The Sixth Part. Now let all People on the Earth Sing to the Lord with chearful voice, Whose love was such to bring thee forth, But chiefly let thy Saints rejoyce. The Lord to us is good indeed, 'Tis he new Creatures did us make; VVe are his flock, he doth us feed, And for his sheep he doth us take. O enter now his House with praise, Approach with joy his Courts likewise, Praise, laud and bless his Name always, For this is comely in his Eyes. For why the Lord our God is good, His Covenant it standeth sure, 'Tis ratify'd by Christ's own Blood, And shall from age to age endure. HYMN 63. [Let us make Christ our all] The Seventh Part. Who make Christ their all. Sing this as the 25th. Psalm. Let us make Christ our all, Let's see we him do love; To us let all things seem but small, Let's value him above House or Land, Husband, VVife, Or Children who are dear; Nay him esteem far above Life, And unto him adhere Deny all for his sake, Exalt him evermore, Then shall we him our all so make VVe never shall be poor. Let's live to him always By whom we all live do, VVithout him let not one soul rest As pleas'd with things below: To him let's give all praise, His glory not divide, For God did him to glory raise, To bring down all our pride. On Ordinances do not rest VVithout you him enjoy; Let him by us be so confest, Let what will us annoy; Yet hold him fast be sure, Let all go for his sake, And him let's love for evermore, O thus your all him make! HYMN 64. [We must make Christ our all] The Eighth Part. We must make Christ our all. We must make Christ our all, 'Cause God o're all is he; And God doth him so high extoll, All to him bend their Knee. 'Tis he who suffered All things too for our sake, And all our Foes has conquered, Your all him therefore make. He all our works hath wrought VVithout and too within; VVithout his strength we can do nought 'Gainst Devil, VVorld, nor Sin. Nothing's of any worth VVhen to him 'tis compar'd; To make him all God brought him forth, A Body him prepar'd To do all things for us, If him therefore we have, VVhat is there more that is precious That we of God can crave. HYMN 65. [Christ is the VVord, in whom is life] The Ninth Part. Christ is the VVord, in whom is life, 'Tis he shall have the glory; Life to the Dead, the truth of Types, The truth of ancient story. Christ is a Prophet, Priest and King, A Prophet that's all Light, A Priest that stands 'twixt God and Man, A King full of delight. Christ's Manhood is a Temple where The Holy God does rest; Our Christ he is our Sacrifice, Our Christ he is a Priest: Our Christ he is the Lord of Lords, Christ is the King of Kings; Christ is the Sun of Righteousness With healing in his wings: Our Christ he is the Tree of Life, In Paradise he grows, Whose Fruits do feed, whose Leaves do heal, Ah! Christ is Sharons Rose: Christ is our Meat, Christ is our Drink, Our Physick, and our Health: Our Peace, our Strength, our Joy, our Crown, Our Glory, and our Wealth. Christ is our Father, and our Friend, Our Brother, and our Love; Our Head, our Hope, our Surety, Our Advocate above. HYMN 66. [Christ is the Shepherd of his Sheep] The Tenth Part. Christ is the Shepherd of his Sheep, Christ is our Mediator; Christ is the Root, Christ is the Branch, Christ is our Testator. Christ is the holy Lamb of God, Christ is our Physician; Christ is the Way, Christ is the Door, The Life of ev'ry Christian. Christ is God's great Embassador, Christ is the only Heir; Christ is the bright and Morning-Star, Christ is beyond compare. Christ is the Foundation sure, Christ is the Corner Stone; Christ is the Witness and the Truth, Christ is the holy One. Christ is a bundle of sweet Myrrh, Christ is the Apple-Tree; The Lilly of the Valley too, Christ he is all to me Th'Captain of our Salvation, And Christ is the true Vine; And Christ is our Counsellor, In Christ all glories shine. Christ is our Heav'n of Heav'ns, Our Christ what shall we call? Christ is the first, Christ is the last, Thus Christ is all in all. The End of the Second Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. Containing Sacred Hymns of Praise ON THE Glorious Excellencies of the Holy Ghost, Or Third Person of the blessed Trinity. HYMN 67. [Lord we thy People here on Earth] Joh. 14. 16. But I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter. [The First Part.] Lord we thy People here on Earth Do meet with great sorrow; Tho' each Soul knows what now he hath, Yet knows not what to morrow May him befall; Afflictions are Oft great, and may encrease; Both from without and from within We meet with little peace. A Comforter, O Lord, we want, O send us one we pray For to sustain each drooping Saint! O send him strait away! Thou told'st us, Lord, thou wouldst send one To live with us for ever, And thou didst, Lord, ascend thy Throne His presence to procure. The Holy Ghost, O it is he! Our comfort in him lyes! There's none else, none can have we Besides to cease our cryes. We know, O Lord, he able is To speak unto our heart; For troubles he, whate're they be, Can joy to us impart: And willing he is always too His helping-hand to lend; He loves us dear, and will appear, We han't a sweeter Friend. The Second Part. Thy Spirit, Lord, is in thy stead Sweet comfort to afford, And of him we do stand in need I'th' absence of our Lord. He visits us, and oft does grieve To see our Souls so sad, And in our troubles doth relieve Us, though our case be bad. He searches and does try our hearts To find our sorrows out, And strives all causes to remove, And so joy work about. According as he finds our state, So unto us doth speak; He does reprove as he sees cause, Which makes our hearts to ake; But presently he smiles again When we do see our sin, And puts a period to our pain, And brings much comfort in. O he is God, and can't mistake The state of any one, And never will our Souls forsake, Nor leave us all alone; But if he doth withdraw at all, It is our Souls to try; Where e're we be when we do call, Ah, he is always nigh! The Third Part. If thy Spirit, Lord, doth speak peace, We peace besure have; He can make all our sorrows cease, And in all troubles save. All Comforters besides him be Unable to relieve, Instead of comfort Job did see They did of joy bereave. The best of them we have below Can speak but to the Ear, But, Lord, thy Spirit we all know Can make our hearts to hear. O then let us not grieve him, Lord, He is our blessed Fsiend; If he to us don't help afford, Our Souls will die i'th' end; But if we are truly sincere, He will us never leave, But in our straits he will appear, And to us close will cleave. O then let us break forth and sing, We shall have peace at home; Our sighs shall go, for we do know The Comforter is come. HYMN 68. [The Wind, Lord, is invisible] Joh. 3. 8. The Wind bloweth where it listeth, &amp;c. [The First Part.] The Wind, Lord, is invisible, Its way we can't find out; No Mortal can thy Spirit see, Though he does search about. His motions they most hidden are, Mysterious in their kind, That thou dost them oft times compare To motions of the Wind. The Wind at thy command doth blow; Lord 'tis as thou dost please, Thy Spirit moves on us below To wound, or to give ease: According to thy Sovereign Grace It operates on Men; Sometimes he doth sharply rebuke, Then cherishes agen. Like as the North-wind, so does he The Worms and Weeds destroy; Those filthy Vermin which we see, Our Souls so much annoy He tryals and afflictions lays On us, and does reprove; And then sweet Southern-gales displays, Our sorrows to remove. The second Part. He like the Wind doth Clouds expell, And makes a clearer Air; Our ignorance he doth repeal, And makes our Sun shine clear. He, like the Wind, does search and try, And pierces ev'ry part, By which he does discern and spy The secrets of each heart. He dryes up all our ways so foul, And makes our paths more clean; He makes a holy gracious Soul, Which had most filthy been. His influence and bless'd effects We oftentimes do feel; He makes the tender Willows bend, And mighty Cedars reel: He makes the glory of Man to fade Like Flowers of the Field, And throws down houses such have made Who on the sands do build. He blows oft times till Rain does fall, Or Tears do pour amain; And afterwards we see withall He clears our sky again. The Third Part. Men with much care and observance Do mind how the Winds blow; So we th'Spirits influence Likewise should strive to know. Our Souls becalm'd sometimes we see For want of a fresh gale, Without thy Spirit move can't we, Thy Wind must fill our sayl. Sometimes thy Spirit blows so slow As if it quite were still, Yet at such times his work doth do With strange and wondrous skill: From all which things it doth appear Th'Spirits Operations Are sometimes less, and sometimes more, He differs in his motions. Let's cry to God who holds the Winds In his Almighty Fist, Who makes it blow this way or that, As he himself doth list; That he would send a fresher gale Upon his Garden so, That our sweet Fruit may never fail, But Spices forth may flow. HYMN 69. [O Lord 'tis sharp, 'tis very cold] 1 Thess. 5. 22. Quench not the Spirit. O Lord 'tis sharp, 'tis very cold, A Fire let us have; We seem benumm'd both young and old, Thy Spirit we do crave, 'Tis that will warm and quicken us Who are so flat and dead; Shall we lye starving and chill'd thus, As if all joys were fled? There is in us so little heat, Our Spirits are so faint, O blow thy fire we intreat, That spark in ev'y Saint: It does give light, and also warmth, Yea 'twill revive us so, That we shall mount and high ascend Above all things below. Let it consume and seize upon That Chaff which is within; O let it burn in every one, And quite consume our sin! Ye Saints take heed ye quench it not, But let it vehement burn, And kindle so, that every sin It may to Ashes turn. Without this fire we can't work, Nor any business do, Life, motion, and activity, Always from him does flow. HYMN 70. [Our wounds do stink, and are corrupt] 1 Joh. 2. 20. But ye have an Unction from the holy One. Our wounds do stink, and are corrupt, Hard swellings we do see; We want a little Oyntment, Lord, Let us more humble be: Thy Spirit will allay our pride, And bring us to thy feet; And when that we are softened, Thy Image on us set. This Oyl will heal and mollifie, O pour it quickly in, That we may live and never die, Lord, by our cursed sin! This Oyl of thine, O it is good All Poyson to expell! It by the vertue of thy Blood Does heal thy Israel. Though worst of Venom in us lye, And has corrupt each part; Yet if thou dost this Oyl apply, 'Twill heal our very heart: And if our face anoynted be, 'Twill make it glorious shine, 'Twill strengthen us, and make us fat, Such is this Oyl of thine. Thy Oyl will not incorporate With any liquid things; An Underlin it won't be made, But to the top it springs. O then afford us Oyl we pray To chear and make us glad, And we thy praise will sing always, And never more be sad. HYMN 66. [A great Estate is purchased] Eph. 1. 13. After ye believed, ye were sealed with that spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance, &amp;c. [The First Part.] A great Estate is purchased, We would Possession have Of that blessed Inheritance, An Earnest therefore crave: Was it not purchased, O Lord, For us by our dear Friend? O then a Pledge do thou afford, An Evidence to end The Controversie that doth rise Continually within, If we'll believe our Enemies, Our Title's lost by sin: But we a promise of it have From thee who can'st not lie, And therefore now we humby crave An Earnest speedily. Like as an Earnest doth confirm, And give an assurance Of some great purchase, even so We all may see from hence God's Spirit is unto our Souls An Earnest of all good, Which Jesus Christ did buy for us With his most precious Blood. And as an Earnest when 'tis given Doth make the Bargain sure, So certain shall he have Heaven This Earnest doth procure. The second Part. He that God's Spirit doth obtain Shall grace and glory have; For he an Earnest of it hath From one that can't deceive. O then come down, O blessed Dove, Abide thou in our breast, To be an Earnest of God's love, And quietly we'll rest; But cease will not, but always cry With confidence of Soul, Thou art our God, O strengthen us, That none may us controul. To God the Father, and the Son, And Holy Ghost therefore, Be blessing, honour, and renown, Now and for evermore. HYMN 72. [O Lord, now we perceive most clear] Eph. 1. 30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption. [The First Part.] O Lord, now we perceive most clear Thy love is great indeed; Ah we shall the Inheritance have Which thou to buy didst bleed. Thou wouldst not, Lord, bought it so dear Had not thy purpose been To make it sure unto our Souls In spite of World, or Sin; And as for us thou didst it buy, And we the Earnest have, So now we also do espy A Seal to us does cleave. We sealed are, O that's a thing Which highly's valued, And great assurance doth it bring Of what is purchased. It also doth impression make Upon the wax always; So we thy Image have hereby, And shall have all our days: But as the wax must melted be Before it can receive Th'impression of the Seal, so we Are softned who believe: And this doth thy bless'd Spirit do, That holy Fire divine His influences this does show, Thus doth his glories shine. The second Part. And as a Seal some strive to change, Or it do counterfeit; So Satan, who about doth range, Does strive our Souls to cheat. A Seal is used to secure Things secret and close, so Thy Saints preserved are hereby From Men and Devils too. Now see ye who Professors are That you have melted been, As soften'd like the wax; have you Been broken for your sin? Hath any promise been set home With power on your heart? Did ever so God's Spirit come His Image to impart? O what Impression do you find? Is holiness in you? Do you now in the Lord delight More than in things below. Take care you who are sealed Ones Ye don't the Spirit grieve; Don't make him sigh with bitter groans, Since such a Seal you have. O prize him, and unto him live! He is your dearest Friend; Due glory see to him you give Always unto the end. HYMN 73. Eph. 4. 30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, &amp;c. The holy Spirit grieve do not, Which God to you doth give, From whom ye have all that rich grace By which to God we live. It is the Spirit that renews The Souls of every one That are brought home to Jesus Christ, Whose darkness now is gone. All light and comfort doth proceed From his sweet influence; 'Tis dangerous then him to grieve, You may perceive from hence. By him you live, by him you walk, Without his help can't we Do any good; O therefore now Let him not grieved be. But bless the Lord he's not withdrawn, O sing his praises forth, And live to him as long as you Do live upon the Earth. HYMN 74. [O Lord we have a blessed grant] Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it self beareth Witness with our Spirit. [The First Part.] O Lord we have a blessed grant Of an Inheritance, And so hath every holy Saint; And thy grace to advance, Thou dost to us an Earnest give Of it to make it sure, And Sealed 'tis when we believe Unto us too for ever: But that we might by no means doubt To make it firmer yet, A Witness, Lord, thou hast found out, Which thou saw'st requisite. Sure 'tis some great and glorious thing That purchas'd was so dear; And 'twill eternal comfort bring To have a title clear. O let thy Spirit, Lord, come in, We'll hear what he can say, Before we dare once, Lord, attempt A Claim unto it lay. But since one Witness may not do, And two required are, Let Conscience with thy Spirit now His witness also bear. The Second Part. Thy Spirit must, Lord, testifie That we are born again; Is all sin dead? Let Conscience speak To put us out of pain. Two Witnesses, nay such as these We'll prize, for they are true; Ah! they will free us from all fear, VVhatever does insue. If they together do agree, The Controversie's gone; If we new Creatures truly be, VVe safe are ev'ry one. They'll make us to lift up our head VVith joy triumphantly; All sorrow will be vanquished, O then let's search and try By thy own Law; for 'tis thy Word The matter must decide; Thy Spirit from thy Word, O Lord, VVe never must divide. O happy Soul, art thou sincere, Upright in life and heart? Do both these joyntly witness bear, That thus also thou art? Then sing the praise of God above, VVho clears to thee this thing; O with the Spirit fall in love, And praise our glorious King. HYMN 75. [VVe of a River now will sing] Joh. 7. 30. He that believeth, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living water. [The First Part.] VVe of a River now will sing, A Stream that sweetly runs; And praise the high and glorious King, That he the Channel turns This way, to us in these dry Isles, I'th' solitary place, Sweet streams of water doe rise up, God doth pour forth his grace. This makes our Wilderness rejoyce, It Sion doth make glad; And Saints to sing with chearful voice, That mourn'd, and were so sad. This River sweetly soaks the Earth VVhere-e're its streams do run, And plenteously he will pour forth His waters e're he's done. This River, O 'tis very deep, The bottom none can know; Fresh always doth its waters keep, And yet they over-flow. Its Banks they are God's holy VVord, That is his lasting bounds; Oh! where God doth his Name record, There are these waters found. Over these Banks it will not go, Nor ever break them down; VVhoe're they be who make a breach, They shall be overthrown. The Second Part. This River when it swiftly runs With an impetuous stream, It drives the Soul to Jesus Christ, O there's no stopping them: Trees that are planted by its side How sweetly do they grow? Like Willows by the Water-course And Drought such never know This River brings things from afar. The best Navigation Is in this River to set out, 'Twill bring us to Salvation. That Soul which doth imploy himself, And work herein each day, He shall be rich eternally, And a bless'd Scepter sway. The Waters of this River are Excellent good to drink; If thou dost taste, thou wilt no more Upon your sorrows think. No Wines so rare, ne're cou'd compare With these Waters besure; And such who do drink of them too, Ah! he shall live for ever. Sing to the River, River of God, Let Sion much rejoyce; O sing ye Saints with one accord To Christ with chearful voice. HYMN 76. [This River flows from God above] Ezek. 36. 25. I will sprinkle clean water upon you. Joh. 7. 30. Out of his belly shall flow living water, &amp;c. [The First Part.] This River flows from God above, It from his Throne proceeds, And sweetly too this way doth move, It many millions feeds. These Waters purge from filthiness, Come wash and be you clean; It makes the barren Soul flourish, And spread his Branches green. It's cooling to a sweating Soul That Satan hunts about; 'Twill quench the fire of lusts within, It does allay our drought. It makes the Seed of Grace to grow, It mollifies our Earth; All such its influences know Who witness the new birth. It heals the wounded Soul likewise, There's no disease within But by these Waters cur'd have been, O drink, and drink agen! O come unto these Waters ye Who very thirsty are! To all that come they are most free, O drink, and do not spare! The Second Part. Do not be foolish and mistake, To go to the wrong Well; These Waters 'tis that you must take, Which far, alas, excell All Waters you can go unto; Ah! would you healed be? To Christ by his own Spirit come, And sickness soon will flee. Ye Fools, what is't that you do drink? 'Tis puddle-water base, It stinks, 'tis filthy, God it loaths, O taste of his sweet grace, And sinful joys will hateful be, And you will spue them up; Come taste a little Water: See! Come try! Take one small sup, And you will say God's love, O 'tis Most pleasant to your taste! But the chief sweetness is reserv'd For us to drink at last. O praise the glorious God above These Waters overflow! Sing praise to Jesus Christ our Lord, And praise the Spirit too. HYMN 77. [VVe many things are yet to learn] Luk. 12. 12. The holy Spirit shall teach you, &amp;c. [The First Part.] VVe many things are yet to learn, Lord, we instructions need; We fain would all thy Truths discern, And from all doubts be freed. Some things be dark, and hidden are That we can't understand, And therefore, Lord, to make them clear By a most skilful hand Thy Spirit hast ordain'd to be A Teacher unto us, All praise and glory unto thee For dealing with us thus. He has all knowledge of thy Laws, And opens ev'ry thing, And can discover ev'ry flaw That up may seem to spring VVithin our minds about the way VVherein we ought to go; Out of a Book he teaches us The meaning he does show. He did himself this Book compile, 'Twas he who gave it out, And therefore can it open well, And Answer ev'ry doubt Unto the ignorant and blind, If they his counsel take, God's Kingdom they at last shall find, And them he'll perfect make. The Second Part. He doth not teach to go astray From thy own written VVord, That's not thy Spirit, nor the way, VVhich doth not just accord In every thing we sure are VVith thy New Testament, Lord, all such Spirits we'll not hear, By thee they were not sent; Thy VVord it is a sure Rule, O let thy Spirit come And witness too't most graciously, And ev'ry Nail drive home. Let all Convictions close abide Of sin and duty too, And let us find each promise firm VVhich unto us doth flow: And we thy Praises will sing forth, And never go astray, VVhen in our Souls thy Spirit doth Tell us this is the way. HYMN 78. [Down from above the blessed Dove] Mat. 3. 16. And he saw the Spirit descending like a Dove, and lighted upon him. [The First Part.] Down from above the blessed Dove Is come; Ah! shall he rest, Thou Holy and Eternal One, VVith me, O in my Breast! There let thy Spirit dwell, O Lord, VVho has a Dove-like Eye, Most quick to see; before his sight All things do naked lye. O he is innocent indeed, Most harmless, and most meek; VVhoever would from wrath be freed, His nature they must seek. All such who are gentle and kind, Most humble in their heart, This Dove infus'd it in their mind, He did that grace impart. Ah! he is swift as any Dove, And quickly can be here; Though he descended from above, Yet is he ev'ry where. The second Part. From sight of thy All-seeing Spirit O whither can we go? His Eyes do search all places out, He walketh to and fro Through the Earth, where can we hide? O whither can we fly, Lord, from thy presence? 'cause thou art Far off, and also nigh. Shall we to Heaven mount aloft? Lo, thou art present there! Or if we should go down to Hell, Ev'n there thou dost appear! Yea, should we take us Morning wings, And dwell beyond the Sea, There would thy right hand have fast hold, And with us quickly be: Nay, if we say the darkness shall Yet shroud us from thy sight, Alas! the thickest darkness is To thee like to the light: Yea, darkness hideth not from thee, But night doth shine as day; To thee the darkness and the night Are both alike alway. The Third Part. Thy Spirit's swift, he's swift in flight, From him there's none can fly; VVe ever be, Lord in thy sight, Thou canst us soon supply VVith all good things which we do need, And could we get thy VVings, VVe should mount up, from fear be freed, And hate earth's empty things. Behold he's come, an Olive-leaf VVithin his mouth we see; God's wrath is o're, it is asswag'd, O therefore joyful be. Let's see thy face, and hear thy voice, And taste thy sweetest love! O Souls ascend! but O for Wings, The VVings of Noah's Dove! Then should we fly away from hence, Leaving this world and sin, And soon wouldst thou, Lord, reach thy hand, And kindly take us in. HYMN 79. [We Strangers are, Lord in the world] Joh. 16. 13. He will guide you into all truth. We Strangers are, Lord in the world, Ah! 'tis a wilderness, And many crooked ways there are, VVe therefore do confess VVe want a Guide who skilful is, Thy Spirit, Lord, is come, No Guide like him be sure there is, O let him guide us home. Thy Spirit points unto thy VVord, And shews where dangers lye; Let's yield our selves with one accord To him continually; And we shall all be rid of cares, And never lose our way; He true Directions always gives, VVe may not go astray. O well it is for us, O Lord, VVho naturally are blind, That we have such a Guide as this To stay our doubtful mind. Then sing to him with heart and voice, No counsel like to his; He will not leave us till he hath Brought us to lasting bliss. The End of the Third Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. Containing SACRED HYMNS Illustrating the glorious Excellencies of God's holy WORD, and blessed Gospel. HYMN 80. [Light is a pleasant thing to see] Psal. 119. 105. Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light to my paths. [The First Part.] Light is a pleasant thing to see, Thy Word true Light doth give, Nothing can, Lord, so pleasant be, 'Tis that by which we live, By which we walk, by which we work, And all things else we do; All they who are without this light, Don't know whither they go. Thy Word discovery, Lord, doth make, It manifesteth things; From thence we do our judgment take, It Knowledge to us brings: What once we were we know hereby How sad was then our state; Sin's filthy nature through it we 'spy, And it do come to hate. The way of our Salvation too It doth discover clear, And how thou wilt be worshipped Whilst we do all live here. The Second Part. Who the true Church is we may see, If thy good Word we heed; And by it we the false Church know, Which filthy is indeed. All things that needful are, O Lord, Unto eternal life, Is plain discovered by thy Word, Which ends all doubts and strife That is, hath been a long time Amongst us here on Earth, About the Church, and Truth of God, But this all silenc'd hath. Light hath a clearing quality, And by its heat things grow; And by it too all Fogs do fly, Such influences flow As doth revive and sweetly chear The Soul that drooping lies, They by thy Word, Lord, quickned are, And all their sorrows flies. Light hath a shining quality, Thy Gospel shines so bright, That nothing can more glorious be In all thy Children's sight. HYMN 81. [How precious is that Word of thine] Psal. 19. 10. More are they to be desired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold. [The First Part.] How precious is that Word of thine, Can Gold with it compare, When 'tis all sacred, all divine? No, there is nothing here Like unto it, 'tis of such worth, A little quantity Of it exceeds all things on Earth, Such glories in it lye. Tho' Gold doth deck the outward Man, This doth the Soul adorn; Thy Gospel is an Ornament, Nay, 'tis thy Peoples Crown. Gold doth make Vessels which are rare, Thy Word and Spirit do Make golden Saints beyond compare, And golden Churches too: Yea, Candlesticks of beaten Gold Are formed out of it, Which glorious are, Lord, to behold, But will be rarer yet. The Second Part. And as Gold is durable, so It will the tryal bear; Thy Word is try'd, and will abide Whilst Heaven and Earth appear. But O what pains do Mortals use To get a little Gold! Which when 'tis got, it flyes away, And it they cannot hold. O then forbear and labour now For Gold that will abide, To lasting glory 'twill bring you, And fill your Souls beside: Which Gold could never do, nor shall, That cannot satisfie The Soul of Man, the thing's too small, It can't its wants supply. True peace and satisfaction is Only in God above; His Word receive, and soon you will Be filled with his love. HYMN 82. [Art thou a Babe, tho' newly born?] 1 Pet. 2. 2. As new born Babes desiring the sincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. [The First Part.] Art thou a Babe, tho' newly born? What is thy Soul's desire? Dost hunger for Milk of God's Word, And raise thy cry yet higher? As pretty Babes who want the Breast, How do they cry amain! Ah! can thy Soul find no small rest Till thou dost Milk obtain: Then know it is a sure sign Thou hast a heavenly heart, And God to feed that Soul of thine Will his sweet Word impart To thee, that thou mayst grow thereby, O it is very good; Milk nourishes and feeds the Child Better than other Food. Stong Meat thou canst not yet digest, Milk's a Restorative; God's Word restores decayed Souls, Nay, makes the dead alive. Milk was a blessing choice of old, And with it Canaan flow'd; Hast thou God's Word? What Blessing then Better can be bestow'd On thee, poor Soul, O prize it much, And on it always feed, Twill strengthen thee, and make thee fat, And nothing shalt thou need. The Second Part. Ye who are Lovers of sweet Milk, Will, will you now make haste? O come and buy! this doth excell! We pray you Friends to taste. If you were once born from above, Though but young Babes you were, You with this Milk would fall in love, And say it tasteth rare. But whilest your evil nature is Corrupted thus with sin, And glutted are continually With filthy trash within, You cannot relish this sweet Food, Your Mouths are out of taste, And therefore you don't find it good, But want it will at last: But you who are God's little ones, What cause have you to sing, That you have plenty still of Milk, And every other thing. O live to God, and sing again His blessed Praises forth, Who feeds, and doth replenish you, And strengthens all your Faith. HYMN 83. [Some of God's Children are grown up] Heb. 5. 14. Strong meat belongs to those that are of age, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Some of God's Children are grown up To such maturity, That they on Meat that's strong can sup, In which great vertues lye. Young-men and Fathers some there be Whose senses have been long In exercise, and therefore they Are stronger than the young And little Babes, whose Stomach's weak, And therefore cannot bear Nor take in dark mysterious things, Which elder Saints does chear. It argues such diseased be Who unto years are grown, If such Meat with them don't agree, By which Christ is made known! More clearly to the Ear and Eye Than other Doctrins can, And therefore we say presently He's a diseased Man. Some base disease on him has frez'd, He's under some decay, His stomach rises at God's Word, And puts it quite away. The Second Part. But like as Meat that's strong doth yield The better nourishmant, So such who can strong things take in, Are not so impotent, Nor ne're so weak as others be, But harder work can do, And unto them continually Does sweeter comforts flow. Small things do them not soon offend, But strengthned be to bear Such things that others startle at, And can't abide to hear. O then ye Saints do you see to't, Your weakness don't betray, Who have been long in Jesus's School, Yet stumbling-blocks do lay In your own paths, and others too, And so expose God's Name To great reproach, but on your selves Do bring the greatest shame: But let the strong bear with the weak In things indifferent, And let the weak more wisdom seek, Than from the strong to rent, It is a blessed truth of God For which the strong contend, Tho' you being weak do yet not see't, But may though in the end. HYMN 84. [How sweet is Honey, and the Comb] Psal. 110. 133. How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than Honey unto my mouth. [The First Part.] How sweet is Honey, and the Comb In which Honey an found! But, Lord, thy Word it doth live all, Its sweetness does abound Beyond all things, though ne're so sweet, There's nothing can it show, Nor set it forth unto its worth Of things which are below: Nothing with it can once compare, O do but taste and try; For none but such can ever tell What good in it doth lye. If you to Honey add such things Which very bitter are, The bitterness it doth take off, Nay sweet it doth appear Unto the taste; so if you do With great afflictons meet, If God a Promise gives to you, The tryal will be sweet. But though Honey so sweet is found, Yet some do it not love; So none do find God's Word most sweet, But those born from above. The Second Part. For the full stomach oft doth loath Thee Honey-Comb so sweet; So carnal [illeg.] count God's Word As poor and sorry Meat. Honey is of a purging kind, God's Word it purges so, It doth make clean both Heart and Mind, The Life and Lip also. O then be like the pretty Bee Which doth industriously From ev'ry Flower she can see Her self store with Honey. And now ye Saints who sweetness find In God's most blessed Word, Sing forth his Praise with joyful Mind Joyntly with one accord.. HYMN 85. [O Lord, we hear War is proclaim'd] Eph. 6. 17. And the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, &amp;c. [The First Part.] O Lord, we hear War is proclaim'd, And we engaged are To fight with thee, and in these VVars, To take our proper share. The Enemy is cruel strong, And will no quarter give; And threatens us both old and young, VVe shan't much longer live: Thou didst o'recome him formerly, He rallies up again His scatter'd force, and we espy VVe fight must or be slain. O let us have thy mighty Sword! O there is none like it! If in our hearts we have thy VVord, VVe'll bring them to our feet. A Sword all Souldiers must have on, So ev'ry Saint must have Thy VVord to fight with, or else they VVill soon their Souls inslave. A Sword doth not only defend The Souldier in the Field, But by it he makes Foes to bend, And unto him to yield: So doth thy Word, O holy Lord, Save us, and yet annoys, All cruel Foes, it brings them down, Nay them it quite destroys. The Second Part. It a two edged Sword is too, It wounds always with one, And with the other it does heal Likewise e're it has done; By its sharp threats it wounds the Soul, But turn it then again, It's Promises does make us whole, And eases every pain: It will cut off an hand or foot, Dismember the old Man; If we do not destroy his Life, We live, Lord, never can. Wounds of a Sword do mortal prove If once it pierce the heart; So let thy Word, Lord, hit our sin, A mortal wound impart. A Sword doth often fright a Foe, So that he cowardly Beholding it, away doth go, Nay, swift perhaps does fly; Even so that Soul who hath thy Word Drawn always in his Hand, Doth make his Enemies to run, A Battel will not stand. The Third Part. Thy VVord is a victorious thing, A VVeapon which oft does Such execution by thy strength, Great Armies it o'rethrows. It must be us'd with greatest skill, And by a pow'rful hand; 'Tis by thy Spirit we do kill All Foes who us withstand. No Hand but that this Sword can wield, The Spirit gives the blow, VVe by them both do win the Field, And Enemies o'rethrow. The Spirit doth thy VVord explain, 'Twas forg'd and given forth Even by himself, and therefore he The chiefest glory hath. The efficacy of thy VVord, Does in thy Spirit lye, It an impression ne're will make, If he don't it apply. All praise do ye give unto God VVho do its power feel; Ah! 'tis a Sword that doth excell The richest made with Steel. The Fourth Part. Ye Saints hold fast besure your Sword, And rather die o'th' spot Than to be cheated of God's VVord; For should it be your lot It for to lose, you naked are And will become a prey Unto the bloody Church of Rome The very self same day: And see you have skill it to use VVhen you with Foes do meet, Or else you never will prevail To bring them to your feet: And always bless the holy God VVho doth to us afford The blessed Scriptures of Truth, Prize it with one accord. HYMN 86. [How prone are people generally] 2 Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass, &amp;c. [The First Part.] How prone are people generally To look into a Glass, But will not look into God's VVord To see their woful case. There may they see how foul they be, How loathsom in God's Eyes, VVhilst in their sins they do remain, Like Swine in filthy Sties. A Glass it is a medium fit Persons to represent, So in thy VVord we may behold Our God Omnipotent; Therein his rare Perfections shine, Yea, his illustrious Face, In all his glorious Attributes, His Goodness and his Grace, VVe in thy VVord may these behold Beyond what we do see; Those VVorks of thine, Lord, can unfold, Or do make known of thee. Here we may see the Father clear, And Son in glory shine; Here doth the Holy Ghost appear, And all alike divine. The Second Part. A Glass, that's true, doth represent A Man's own nat'ral Face, But he away goes, and forgets VVhat kind of Man he was: So they who only hear God's VVord, And the same do not do, The Holy Ghost to such compare, Which doth their folly show. A Glass is us'd to dress the Head To put on their Attire; Come, dress your selves by this rare Glass, To raise your beauty higher. Here you may see what still you want, The which you must have on; Here may you see how fair you be, That Grace doth sweet adorn. You wanton Ones, for shame leave off Your evil habits, who Spend so much time in looking in Your Glasses; Sinners know. Your Glasses will in the last day As Witnesses arise Against you in judgment severe, Such folly in it lyes, That nothing can more hateful be Such precious time to spend, To dress a filthy Head that must Be eat of Worms i'th' end, Whilst your poor Soul has nothing on But stinking Rags most vile, And is neglected and forgot By you too all the while. HYMN 87. [Lord 'tis a droughty time we see] Deut. 32. 2. My Doctrine shall drop as the Rain. Lord 'tis a droughty time we see With us, alas, within, Our moysture seems all dried up By Lust, that fire of sin. O thou who dost command the Clouds, Shall now thy Showers fall? Shall Rain pour out on barren Hearts? And Dews distill as small Upon the sweet and tender Herb, That so the one may be Made soft with Rain, and th'other Refreshed be by thee? The Rain falls at thy dread Command A Shower here and there; 'Tis as thou dost, O Lord, appoint That we of Blessings share; That we enjoy thy precious Word, Whilst others barren lye, Who hardly have one drop of Rain Their wants for to supply. The former Rain was poured out, It was a mighty shower; So shall the latter Rain come down Before this day is o'er. A little at one time, again We have a little more; Thus doth thy Word like unto Rain Refresh thy blessed Poor. Rain makes the Earth both fresh &amp; green, And ev'ry thing to grow; Tis by thy Word and Spirit; Lord, We thrive and flourish do. There's none can stop the Rain that falls, If thou Commission give, Thy Word shall come upon us all, Thy Grace shall make us live. Let sin and Devil do their worst, Thy Word shall not return Unto thee empty, it prosper shall, For thy Will must be done. The Third Part. Thy Ministers are like to Clouds Who do the Rain retain; Of them thou dost make equal use To pour it out again. O let us then cry unto God His Clouds may all be full, Not empty ones which hold no Rain, But do deceive the Soul, And pray that we may always have Rain as we do it need, That Grace may grow, and in us all Spring up like to choice Seed, And praise the glorious God above Who doth such Blessings send; If we his Mercies do improve, Our days will joyful end. 'Tis a sore Judgment when the Lord Doth stop the Bottles of Heav'n, But O 'tis worse when God's good Word And Blessings are with helden. We wisk away, our glory fades When God his Word denies, Or doth with-hold his Blessings from't, Both Faith and Hope then dies. O look to God, remember him From whom your Fruit doth flow! If you are fruitful, sing his praise, And live unto him too. HYMN 88. [As Dew doth insensibly fall] Deut. 32. 3. My Speech shall distill as Dew. As Dew doth insensibly fall, So doth God's gracious Word Invisibly op'rate in us, As we have often heard. How sweet are Dews unto the Herb, It makes them richly smile; So doth thy Word bedew oft-times Thy own true Israel. It makes our Graces to send forth A rare and fragrant scent, Which doth delight the holy One, The Lord omnipotent. But Dews will not, Lord, always do, Mens hearts so barren are; Some soaking showers they must have, If any Fruit they bear. All praise and glory unto God Who wisely orders things, That as our wants and needs appear, His Mercies flow like Springs. HYMN 89. [Thy Word is treasure very rare] 2 Cor. 4. 7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Thy Word is treasure very rare, For we do often see Thou dost to Gold the same compare, And things that glor'ous be. It is, Lord, of so great a worth No Man can comprehend, Nor Tongues of Angels set it forth, All Riches does transcend: Ah! such is thy most holy Word, Through it thy precious love To us conveyed is, O Lord, This doth the matter prove That which the best and wisest Men Esteem'd above all things, And is the channel that let's in The joy of divine Springs; And doth enrich the Soul of Man, And that eternally; The worth of it there's no one can Express assuredly. The Second Part. Some treasure that in bulk is small, Yet doth in worth excell; Such is thy Gospel, blessed Lord, Thy People know it well. One Promise is more worth than all The Gold which the World hath; If thou dost give it, then we shall Say, What is all the Earth When unto it compar'd it is? This Treasure does delight The Souls of Saints, and makes them sing To thee both day and night. It hath such influence on the Heart, As earthly Treasure here, That on thy Word we meditate, Because our hearts are there Where our chief Treasure even lyes, On that the heart is set, And hence it is they it esteem 'Bove their necessary Meat. This makes Men great and honourable, Because much Treasure have; This also frees from care and trouble, And does not us inslave To Dunghil-Earth, as Treasures do, It raises Souls above All things that are, O Lord, below, To joy in thy sweet love. The Third Part. Treasure in Earthen Vessels is Often laid up by us, And we know very well, so 'tis The Treasure's ne're the worse: Ev'n so altho' thy Gold is found In Ministers so mean, The worth of it doth still abound, Though some do not esteem Of it, because the Vessels are Despis'd; but there's a day When they shall glorious appear, And golden Scepters sway. O prize God's faithful Servants then, Who do inrich your Souls! O value them above all Men, And be no longer Fools To grieve them, and to wear them out By any means, if ye Would ever, in the Judgment-day Christ's face with comfort see; For as you 'steem or dis-esteem True Preachers of God's Word, Christ looks upon't as done to him, Like measures will award; And you whom God doth Vessels make His Treasure to retain, See that you seek his Praise always, And don't his Glory stain. HYMN 90. [Thy Word it doth illuminate] Jer. 23. 29. Is not my Word like Fire. [The First Part.] Thy Word it doth illuminate, It giveth forth sweet light, And also from it we have heat, Our Graces to excite. Thy Word, like Fire, doth consume Our filth and dross within; What is combustible does waste, It siezes on our sin. Fire is of an ascending kind, It mounts things up aloft; So they mount up in heart and mind, Who by thy Word are taught; As fir'd are by thy own Spirit, Thy Word without that, Lord, Will never burn, nor raise our hearts (As we have newly heard.) Fire will melt and soften things That hard are naturally; 'Tis by thy Word and Spirit we Do with thy Will comply. 'Tis that which bends &amp; makes us yield, And humbles much the heart, Which naturally was proud and vain, And too obdurate. The Second Part. Thy Word it quickens and revives, Like Fire it does chear; It consolates and makes such warm Who to it do draw near: For they who to it will not come, No profit can receive; So such who do reject thy Word, Their Souls shall not live. Fire will penetrate and pierce, There is no secret place Within the Soul, but thy Word will Most quick and swiftly pass. It doth the very Thoughts discern, Nay it divides between The Soul and Spirit of a Man, To sever both from sin. And Fire is used to lay waste Houses where Rebels hide, Ev'n so thy Word doth quite consume The House of Lusts and Pride. Man with vain hopes a House doth raise, And vaunts himself each day; But when thy Word doth sieze on him, His House consumes away. All his vain hope he had before, It is consum'd and gone, And a new Temple up is rais'd For the most holy One. The Third Part. Take heed, ye Sinners, you don't quench God's Word, that fire within; Nor lesson not its burnings if You would not die in sin. If you will sin and have your Lusts, Whatever Preachers say, Then down to Hell be sure you must, When Death takes you away. Ah! there's another Fire know, If this your filth don't waste, Into Eternal Fire then you Shall all be thrown at last. Consider is't not better far That sin consumed be, Yea, all beloved sins and lusts, Than damn'd eternally. You that do find the work's begun, That there's a spark of Fire Kindled in your Souls, O let it burn, And raise its flames up higher! O 'tis, Soul know, a sacred spark, 'Tis Fire all divine! And God be sure has kindled it In that poor Soul of thine. The Fourth Part. Consider God's design herein Is to soften thy heart, And to cement thy Soul to him, And Saving-grace impart: And if it should be quench'd in thee, It lyes not in thy power To kindle it, and God in wrath May also give thee over, And never more renew that work, But let thee quite alone, In all thy sins to take thy swinge, Until thy Soul is gone. But ye who are the Saints of God, As this is Fire divine; So let Devils strive and do their worst, It in thy Soul shall shine; Though not always to such degree Your sin it deaden may, And therefore see you careful be To cherish it each day; And sing God's praise continually, Who makes the Fire burn, And pray that he would blow it up, Till all your work is done; And also cry unto the Lord This Fire to kindle round about, And sweetly burn in ev'ry place, And never be put out. HYMN 91. [Rocks they are hard to work upon] Jer. 23. 29. Is not my Word like a Fire, and like a Hammer, to break the Rock in pieces? [The First Part.] Rocks they are hard to work upon, Yea, 'gainst a mighty Hand; The hardest Flint or Pebble-stone Whole, long it cannot stand. If thou, O Lord, art pleas'd to take The Hammer up and strike, Thou wilt Impression quickly make, Though none can do the like. There's none can break our flinty Rock Besides thy self alone; Alas, our power is too weak To break such hearts of stone! What can the Hammer do, O Lord, Thou the great Agent art; The Instrument, that is thy Word, O smite upon the heart, And make it yield! and square it then For thy own bless'd design; Thy Image on it, Lord, cut out Most holy and divine; And fit it for thy building too, O set it in its place, And life infuse into it so That it may shine with Grace. The Second Part. O let it be well polished, And it also-unite Unto thy building, there to be A Jasper-stone most bright, That it may suit and well agree With the Foundation stone, Which is of Gold, no Diamond More glorious ever shone; And then shall we, when thus we be Into thy Building laid, Have cause to sing unto our King By thy eternal aid. This Hammer of thy blessed Word Must drive the Nail quite home, Or else Convictions will not stick Whenever they do come: The Precept, Lord, will not abide, Nor Promise fast'ned be; Nor no Conviction last in us, Until drove home by thee: But since we find they fasten'd are, Let us sing forth thy Praise; And since thy Word so precious is, Let us its Glory raise. HYMN 92. Hymns on the Divine Authority of the Sacred Scriptures. [The First Part.] The sacred Scriptures are sublime, Although mysterious be; Their Matter shews they are divine, Nay, their divinity Is seen by what they do treat of, Or unto us make known, There we do read of great Jehovah, The high and lofty One, Of his dread Essence, nature pure, And of the Unity Between the Father, Son, and Spirit, Or holy Trinity; There do we read of his great works Who did this World frame; How out of nothing by his Word All things at the first came. There we may see and wonder too How infinite Wisdom shone With' glorious compact made between The Father and the Son, In finding out, and bringing in A way for to unite Justice and Mercy, that so they Might equally shine bright. Here Justice doth with Mercy meet Like an endeared Brother; And Mercy doth God's Justice greet, And both do kiss each other. From hence ye may see cause to sing Th'Eternal One's high praise (In bringing in of Jesus Christ) With thankful hearts always. The second Part. Th'Antiquity of Scripture show That they are most divine; For no Writings did the World know So soon as they did shine. This was the first and chiefest Book That e're was made or pen'd; O therefore love in it to look, Though you can't comprehend The Mysteries that lye therein Hid from all carnal Eyes; Yet since it hath so ancient been, O see these lines ye prize! Their Royal descent from God alone Also does plain appear By their high Style and Majesty, That shines in them most clear. The Third Part. The holiness which they promote To such a high degree, May clearly ev'ry Soul convince Of their Authority: So pure and perfect is God's Word It silence may all them Who it oppose, and Saints from hence It love and much esteem. Ps. 119. 140. This is the cause wherefore they love God's Words better than Gold Or Jewels rich, which are esteem'd By most who them behold. They see God's Precepts are most just, It doth all sins descry, And ev'ry Lust and false way they Hate therefore bitterly. Th'admirable and sweet consent, And blessed harmony That's in the whole and ev'ry part Shews their divinity. The credit of their Pen-men too, Whom none could ever charge With the least forgery or guile, Doth prove to us at large, That they from God alone proceed, Who did their Souls inspire In writing all they written have, That Grace we might admire. The Fourth Part. Their Prophecies accomplish'd were, (Which shews they are divine,) Exactly as to time and thing, To matter and design: And the Miracles which were wrought These VVritings do confirm, Must needs also herein be brought, To shew from whence they came. The preservation they have had Was strange and marvellous, And to their truth doth glory add For to be priz'd by us. The great success with which they met In midst of bitter Foes, And how their power has prevail'd, Their lasting glory shows: The VVorld by a few Fishermen, By this most sacred Word, Without the help of carnal force, VVere turned to the Lord. The Fifth Part. The harmony and joynt consent Of holy Men and good, And Martyrs who seal'd to the Truth Of them with their dear Blood, Do shew their great veracity, And may all Men convince They came from God, therefore we must Bear up in their defence Against all such who them oppose, Or count them not divine; For doubtless in all wise Mens sight By these their glory shine. The Evidence unto the heart VVhich to good Men they give Of God's great love, who doth impart To all who them receive (In life and power) his Image clear: Bringing the old Man down, Renewing of their inward Man, So that they can't but own The work which by this Word is wrought On them to be divine; Thus from these hints which we have brought Gods VVord doth glorious shine. The very Heathen witness bear As to Matter of Fact, Touching such things Scriptures declare That God and Christ did act. The Sixth Part. Berolus, as Josephus shews, Doth mention Noah's Flood; And Pliny, lib. 5. cap. 16. &amp; Justin, lib. 36. Pliny, with some others, speak How the most mighty God Did Sodom turn by dreadful Flames Unto a dismal Lake: Of Moses and his VVonders too VVe find the Egyptians speak In their Records; yea, the Chaldeans And Grecians own the same: And others shew with what high hand Isræl from Egypt came. The Star which at Christ Jesus Birth To th'VVise-men did appear, Pliny and Calcidius both Most plain and full declare. But there's no need of Man's Record, To Men we do not fly; The witness of the glorious Lord Is full of certainty. HYMN 93. [The Scripture broken cannot be] Joh. 10. 35. And the Scripures cannot be broken, &amp;c. The Scripture broken cannot be, Let Men think what they will, Such, such is their veracity, God will his VVord fulfill. VVhatever thou, O Lord, hast said, Accomplished shall be; No Promise past, nor Threat delay'd, No Soul shall ever see; Because they are Diuine we know, Of such Authority, That they from thee alone do flow, VVho will not, cannot lye. Let Saints therefore rejoyce and sing, For they from hence may see Great comfort unto them does spring To all eternity; For what thou hast, Lord, promised To such who do believe, As 'tis contained in thy VVord, The same they shall receive: But wo unto all wicked Ones, Their doom appears hereby; For if they live and die in sin, In Hell they all must lye. All praise to thee, O God, alone, VVhose VVord we know shall stand; Let all such sing who it believe, And yield to thy command, VVho will do all, and do no more Than written they do fee, These, these shall sing, and thee adore Unto eternity. HYMN 94. [In Heaven, Lord, where thou dost dwell] Psal. 119. 89. For ever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in Heaven. In Heaven, Lord, where thou dost dwell Thy VVord's establish'd sure, And shall to all eternity Fast graven there endure. From age to age thy Truth abides, As doth the Earth witness, Whose Ground-work thou hast laid so firm No tongue can it express. Go too therefore ye foolish Men, Depart from me, Be gone; For God's good Precepts we'll obey, Nay, keep them ev'ry one. What thou hast promis'd, Lord, perform, Till Death doth seize on me; Ner'e let my hope abuse me so As to distrust in thee. Uphold me and I shall be safe For ought they do or say, And in thy Statutes pleasure take, O Lord, both night and day. Thou hast trod such under thy feet VVho do thy Statutes break; For nought avails their subtilty, Their counsel is but weak. HYMN 95.Psal. 119. 8, 9, 10, 11. [Thy Covenants are very deep] Thy Covenants are very deep, And full of things profound; My Soul therefore thy Word will keep When they are try'd and found. When Men enter into thy VVord, They find a Light most clear; Tho' Fools, yet they, Lord, shall not err VVhen they to it adhere. The VVord of God most perfect is, His Testimony sure; Converting Souls, and making wise The simple and obscure. The Statutes of the Lord are right, And fill the heart with joys; The Precepts of the Lord are pure, Enlightning the Eyes. The Fear of God is clean also, And doth endure for ever; The Judgments of the Lord are true, And righteous altogether. Yea, more than Gold, than much fine Gold To be embrac'd alway; The Honey and the Honey-comb Are not so sweet as they: They are thy Servants Monitors, How he his life should frame, And great Rewards is there for them VVho do observe the same. HYMN 96. [Search the Scripture, by which ye think] Joh. 5. 39. Search the Scriptures. Search the Scripture, by which ye think Eternal Life to have; And those are they that testifie Of Him that came to save; For what of old was given forth VVas for our learning penn'd, That we by Scriptures comforted Might hope unto the end. The Prophecy came not of old By Man's own private will, But holy Men of God foretold By Heavn's inspired skill: Then to the Law and Testament For they that speak not right, And as this Word doth represent, In them there is no light: For Scripture, sacred Verities Came all by Inspiration, Able to perfect and make wise, Through Faith, unto Salvation. HYMN 97. The Excellency of the Gospel. Blessed be God that we were born Under the joyful sound, And rightly have Baptized been, And bred on English ground, Where God most gracious doth appear, And does pour forth his Grace; The lines are fallen unto us In a most pleasant place. “We might have been dark Pagans all, “Or veiled like each Jew, “Or cheated with an Alcoran “Amongst the Turkish crew. Dumb Pictures might we all ador'd, Like Papists in Devotion; And with Rome's Errours so been stor'd, To drink her deadly Potion. We might have liv'd in shades of night, And ne're have known good days, But thou hast sent us Gospel Light To thine eternal praise. The Sun which rose up in the East, And drove their shades away, Hath sent his Light unto the West, And turn'd our Night to Day. Blessed be God for what we see, Our God for what we hear; Sweet News of Heaven, Lord, from thee Sounds daily in our Ear. The End of the Fourth Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART V. Containing SACRED HYMNS Setting out and illustrating the transcendent Excellencies of the GRACES of the HOLY SPIRIT. HYMN 98. [How unsavoury, O Lord, are things] Mark 9. 50. Have Salt in your selves. [The First Part.] How unsavoury, O Lord, are things, Unless they salted be! And so indeed were all our Souls, Till seasoned by thee With thy most sweet and precious Grace, That is the Salt whereby We sav'ry do become, O Lord, Thy Salt, O then apply. Salt is of such a quality That it doth search each part Of Flesh, that it is laid upon, So Grace searches the Heart: The Spirit searches all deep things, Yea, the deep things of God; It will find out what sin in us Doth still make its abode; And then (like Salt) doth purge it out, 'Tis Grace which purifies The heart and life, there is no doubt But such, like vertue, lyes In that most precious Grace of thine, O then let's look and see Whether we search'd and purged are, And then sing praise to thee. The Second Part. Salt doth preserve, 'tis evident, Both Meat and other things, Else they'll corrupt and quickly taint; Like Vertue also springs From thy good Grace, 'tis that, O Lord, Which doth preserve from sin All graceless Sinners odious stink, So filthy are within, That all their inward parts corrupt, And they like Carrion lye In a vile Ditch, or Common-shore, In their iniquity. But such in whom Gods Grace is wrought, Grace does their Souls preserve From sin, in heart, in life, in thought, Uprightly God to serve. Most sweet are they and savoury To God and unto Men, And all their works they have perform'd By Grace have season'd been. The Third Part. Salt is of universal use, There's nothing Men want more; Without God's Grace there's none can live, Let them be rich or poor. Such absolute need have we thereof, Without it can't live here A holy life; nor can we stand When Jesus doth appear. All ranks of Men both high and low, Both Kings and Peasants too, Must salted be with Grace on Earth, Or down to Hell must go; In ev'ry state, where-er'e they be, By Sea as well as Land, They Grace do need continually If sin they would withstand: Our speech, and all that we do say, Must season'd be with Salt; Or else our words and breath will stink, And all be good for nought. The Fourth Part. Salt, Naturalists do oft declare, Is good against the stings Of Serpents; and does Worms destroy Which from Corruption springs. Grace is a sovereign remedy Against the sting within; And kills the Worm of Conscience too, The product 'tis of sin: Sin is a thing most venomous, A sting it is likewise Of the old Serpent, and 'tis worse Than what in Poyson lyes: This kills the Soul and Body too, And poysons ev'ry part; And doth corrupt each faculty Of ev'ry Sinners heart. Salt was of use under the Law; For ev'ry Sacrifice Must salted be, and so must we Before All-seeing Eyes: Yea, ev'ry Prayer and Offering That's offered up on high; Your Duties all must season'd be With Grace continually. But other Salt, if Meat do stink, It can't it sav'ry make, But Grace will such recover who Most filthy ways do take, And in God's Nostrils loathsom are, Yet Grace will sweeten them; Nay, they will such a savour bear He'll highly such esteem. The Fifth Part. But we, alas, do often see Salt lofe its savour may; Or things may over-salted be, If too much on they lay: But Grace in both these things excells, Its savour cannot lose; Nor can we have of it too much, Most savoury are all those Who most are salted with this Salt, O therefore loudly cry For Grace good store, and do not fear, God will your wants supply. Then sing forth Praises to the Lord With Grace in all your hearts, And see that you well-season'd are In all your inward parts. HYMN 99. [True Grace, and true Sincerity] Eph. 6. 14. And having your Loyns girt about with Truth, &amp;c. [The First Part.] True Grace, and true Sincerity Is like a Girdle rare, Which some about their Loins do love Continually to wear. Like as a Girdle cleaves to Men, And doth them compass in; So Grace should cleave unto our Souls, To keep us from all sin. We in the bonds of Truth and Grace Should evermore abide, And never from God's Grace and Truth Go back, nor turn aside. And as a Girdle strengthneth The Loyns of ev'ry one, So will this Girdle of Truth also All such who have it on. If you in the true Doctrine are, And in sincerity Do firmly stand in every Truth, Small weakness you'll espy To be in you, for strength you'll have, If that your hearts be found; And every Gospel blessed Truth Be evermore your bound. The Second Part. The Souldier in the days of old His Armour did gird on, And then compleatly harnessed Was he to look upon: So must the Christians Armour be Girt with sincerity, What will Mens Faith, or Righteousness, Or Hope else signifie, If they are not upright in heart, And Truth is not their bound, They Hypocrites be sure will then (If so) at last be found To have the Loyns well girt, denotes That Preparation we Unto the Battel ought to make, So ready must we be For to encounter or engage With all our cruel Foes, To have our Armour girt with Truth, And then need fear no blows. The Third Part. Girdling also service denotes, Let Loyns be girt about; And let your Lights be shining too, And let them not go out; That ye may on your Master wait, Whose coming doth draw near; Be ready therefore every Saint, O now your selves prepare! Let ev'ry thing in truth be done, And Grace the Girdle be; And then with joy shall ev'ry one Their blessed Master see. A Girdle is an Ornament, It fastens all together, And covers Joynts the Armour hath That Men cannot tell whether 'Tis all one piece, or 'tis in parts, It doth them so unite; Thus doth Uprightness us adorn, That in Jehovah's sight There seems no flaw, nor no defects, Uprightness covers all; God doth that Soul who is sincere, A perfect Christian call. The Fourth Part. Come, art thou low, of mean descent, And of ignoble birth? Grace covers this deformity, Its glory so shines forth: Or art thou lame, or outwardly May blemishes be seen? Yet Grace doth cover this defect, Thy Beauty's great within: Or art thou poor, and so art brought Unto contempt and scorn? Sincerity doth make thee rich, Nay more, to be high born. May be thy parts and gifts are small, And hence Men thee dispise? Sincerity hides this in all, In this thy Glory lyes; For Grace excells the greatest Gifts, Gifts may to Man commend; But Grace commends thee now to God, And so 'twill in the end. The Fifth Part. Soul, hast thou worse defects than these, Infirmities within? Sincerity doth God so please, It covers all thy sin. He it esteems so as if thou Hadst never broke his Law, And through Christ's Righteousness he doth In thee behold no flaw. O get this Girdle on, ye Saints, It glitters more than Gold; It never can besides be lost, And doth its Beauty hold As fresh as 'twas when first put on, O bless'd Sincerity! How glorious art thou! how dost thou Shine in Jehovah's Eye! See then that ye the Truth hold fast, And with it girted be; Then no delusion needst thou fear, Nor cursed Heresie; But the right Girdle take be sure, And not the counterfeit, The true by this you may descry, Christ's Truth is stampt on it. It with the written Word agrees Exact in ev'ry thing; If all Christ's Prècepts you don't own, Contempt on you 'twill bring. That Girdle will not hold but break, Though you may seem sincere So far as you cleave unto Truth, Yet will at last appear A false Professor, 'cause you have Some blessed Truth withstood, Into which you did Light receive, But not obey it wou'd. The Sixth Part, with Psal. 117. Each Truth of God, O it is pure, God's Truth doth make us clean; It frees our Souls also for ever, Such glory in it's seen. Strong is the Truth you all will say, This Girdle then is strong; O buy it, Souls, whilst 'tis to day, 'Twill fit both old and young. God's Saints did suffer grievous pain, Great tortures did endure Before they would part with the Truth, Such peace it did procute Unto their Souls who faithful were Unto the Truth alway; O it will make you holy, bold In the great Judgment-day. Now let all Nations of the Earth Their great Creator praise; Nay let the people all sing forth His mighty Name to raise; Whose Kindness's great unto his Saints, His Mercies ever sure; O praise ye him for his bless'd Truth Which doth abide for ever! HYMN 100. [O Lord, we Souldiers are, and we] Eph. 6. 14. And having on the Breast-plate of Righteousness, &amp;c. [The First Part.] O Lord, we Souldiers are, and we Must fight, or else be slain; O let us all well armed be, For Foes come on amain! And since our Enemies do aim To hit us on the Breast, Thy blessed Breast-plate let's have on, For that will hold the test. 'Tis righteousness that will secure Our Souls from ev'ry wrong, And 'twill also, O Lord, endure As well as it is strong. There's no engaging in these Wars Without a Righteousness; This Breast-plate scatters all our fears, Who do thy Name profess. A Breast-plate 'tis that doth preserve The Body's chiefest part; 'Tis Righteousness which, Lord, doth save Our precious Souls and Heart. The Second Part. A Breast-plate doth the Souldier chear, It makes him very bold; So Righteousness doth make us all Our Sword with courage hold, And not to fear i'th' day of evil What any man can do; Nay we hereby withstand the Devil, Who doth great malice show. O then, ye Saints, see you maintain A good and holy life, And soon thereby you will obtain An end of all that strife With which you meet from Foes without, And also from within; O know it is God's great design To purge you from your sin; And that you holy should all live, And hence 'tis you have Grace; The Seed of Holiness is sown, And it will grow apace, If under God's shinings ye sit, And he his Rain doth send, Then will your Righteousness break forth, And peace will flow i'th' end; And of God's Goodness ye shall sing, And lift your voice on high, And happy be when God doth bring You on Death-Beds to lye. HYMN 101. [Faith is a Grace that God hath wrought] Eph. 6. 16. Above all things take the shield of Faith. Faith is a Grace that God hath wrought In us who do believe; If it be strong, we need not care What Gun-shots we receive From Satan, who his fiery Darts Continually lets fly; Ah! 'tis our Shield to save all parts, Whatever danger's nigh. A Shield is turned ev'ry way, That so no Dart may wound; And we by Faith, as with a Shield, Are compassed quite round. The Will and Judgment it secures, And doth Affections keep Warm unto Christ, and Conscience too, It saves from drousie sleep. A Shield preserves the other part Of Armour we have on; So Faith secures every Grace; That hurt be done to none. Christ's Righteousness is very pure, To that 'tis we must flee; And unto us by Faith 'tis sure, And this by Faith we see. HYMN 102. [By Faith we do on Christ depend] 1 Pet. 1. 7 That the tryal of your Faith, which is much more precious than Gold, &amp;c. By Faith we do on Christ depend For all that he hath done; By Faith we do to God ascend With many a bitter groan: And we receive what we do want, When we by Faith do cry; Faith doth sustain each drooping Saint, And all their needs supply. Gold is a thing that has the Name Of things that precious are; For Preciousness Faith has the same, With which Gold can't compare. Tho' Gold is precious when 'tis try'd, Yet tried Faith exceeds The finest Gold, 'tis more in worth, And does supply all needs: 'Tis more desirable far than Gold, O with it fall in love! And as hid Treasure seek it do Of God, through Christ above. Gold by the Touch-stone must be try'd, So you must try your Faith; No Touch-stone but God's blessed Word Is there in all the Earth. HYMN 103. [Hope is a precious Grace, O Lord] 1 Thess. 5. 8. And for an Helmet the Hope of Salvation. Hope is a precious Grace, O Lord, And fixed it must be Upon thy self most patiently, No other Hope have we. 'Tis not on Gold, nor length of days, Nor on things here below; But 'tis on Jesus Christ alone, From whence all Help doth flow: And like a Helmet 'tis we find That doth preserve the Head; Hope stays on thee, always our mind, When we are hard bested; And as a Helmet fearless makes A Souldier in the Field; So hope of glory makes us all Resolve we ne're will yield To Satan, nor to other Foes, When we with them do meet; Nor need we fear their cruel blows, If we have this Helmet, Since we compleatly armed are, Even from head to foot, Our head-piece makes us to appear Both fierce and very stout. This Helmet will us never fail If that we have it on; The Soul it is, it doth preserve Till all our dangers gone. HYMN 104. [This World's a Sea, our Soul's a Ship] Heb. 6. 19. Which Hope we have as the Anchor of the Soul. [The First Part.] This World's a Sea, our Soul's a Ship With raging Tempest tost; And if she should her Anchor slip, She doubtless will be lost. Thou, Lord, our skilful Pilot art, Thou know'st all Rocks and Sands; Our Seamen are our Faculties, Which must do thy commands. Faith like a Cable doth appear, Hope is our Anchor sure; And if right cast, we need not fear We shall each Storm endure. Repentance like a Bucket is To pump the water out; For leaky is our Ship, alas, Which makes us look about. Thy Graces are our blessed Fraight, And Heaven is our Port; Thy Spirit, Lord, must fill our Sails If e're we bid fair for't. The Second Part. Lord, still the Seas, alas, they swell, And very tempestuous are; Our Compass is thy Holy Word, By that 'tis we must steer. Lord, thou hast power o're the Seas, Let us not calmed be; And when the Waves do roar and swell, Let's cast our Hope in thee, Which like an Anchor doth take hold With that within the Veil; And if right cast, we may be bold, Our courage shall not fail. We for our Anchor have a Rock That is most firm and sure, And thou wilt us, Lord, ne're deceive, But will our Souls secure. Let Hope be fixt on Christ our Lord, And on thy Covenant; Thy Promises also afford Relief to ev'ry Saint. Christ's Death and Resurrection too Our Hope is grounded on; If thus we cast our Anchor do, We safe are ev'ry one. HYMN 105. [O set thine Image on my Heart] Cant. 8. 6. Love is strong as Death, Jealousie as cruel as the Grave, the Coals thereof are as Coals of Fire, &amp;c. [The First Part.] O set thine Image on my Heart! O seal it on my Arm! For Love, like Death, doth cast its Dart, And Jealousie is warm. 'Tis like the Grave, whose keen desire Nothing can satisfie; The Coals thereof ate Coals of Fire That flame most vehemently. Waters can't quench Love's Flames, nor Floods The same can ever drown; If some for Love would give his Goods, Despis'd is such an one. Lord, bear our Name upon thy Breast, Engrave it on thy Heart, There let it be so sure possest It thence may ne're depart; For Love we find is very strong, It wounds unto the quick; Thy presence, Lord, supports our Souls, Thy absence makes us sick. Shouldst thou but seemingly disdain Our Souls that are engag'd, Like Fire it would put us to pain, Whose grief's not soon asswag'd. The Second Part. O love us then, or else we die; Is it not thee we crave? If thou thy Love shouldst once deny, We soon should find a Grave. Death conquers all, and all submit Unto his pale command; So Love brings all unto its feet Who are therewith inflam'd. The Grave is never satisfy'd, No more, alas, can he Who having tasted of thy Love, Till he enjoyeth thee. But Death destroys and also kills, But Love doth make alive; It kills our sin, and we thereby Do presently revive: But if the Object be deny'd The Heart is set upon, We never can be satisfy'd Until our life is gone. Love so doth flame, and Jealousie So burns the Heart and Eyes; The Soul must be embrac'd by thee, Or be Love's Sacrifice. Whole Seas of trouble cannot quench Love's everlasting flame; Let what will come where true Love is, That Soul is still the same. HYMN 106. [Lord, are we dead? dead unto sin?] Col. 2. 12. Buried with him in Baptism. Lord, are we dead? dead unto sin? Then buried let us be; Let sin be cover'd, the old Man Be slain, O Lord, by thee. We have Baptized been, O Lord, As such who were all dead, To shew that thou didst lye i'th' Grave, We all were buried Under the water, whereby we Do in a figure see, That as we shew'd how we are dead, So raised are with thee. None buried are till dead they be, Those who baptized are Ought to be dead to ev'ry sin, To self, and all things here. Those who are buried, covered are All over in the Earth; In Baptism the self-same thing Must plain be holden forth: Or else it answers not the end Of Christ, who did ordain That glorious Rite, if not so done, They do the same prophane. HYMN 107. [Repentance, when wrought in the Soul] Heb. 6. 1, 2. Not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards God, ver. 1. Of the Doctrine of Baptism, and laying on of Hands, &amp;c. ver. 2. [The First Part.] Repentance, when wrought in the Soul, And Faith for to believe, Then such on Jesus Christ rely, And truly him receive As their dread Lord and Sovereign Him always to obey, And in all things o're them to reign, And govern night and day. Christ's Baptism is very sweet, With laying on of Hands, Our Souls are brought to Jesus's Feet In owning his Commands. Those Ordinances Men oppose, And count as carnal things; We have clos'd with, and tell to those, From them great comfort springs. Thee, holy Lord, we must obey, Though Men reproach us still; Yet let us do what thou dost say, And yield unto thy Will; And still alone on thee rely, And not on what we do; In point of trust we fly to thee, And let our own works go; And though in minding thy sweet truth, Men do us vilifie, Yet we resolve, Lord, in thy strength, To own them till we die. The Second Part. O Lord, let us not turn our back On thee whom we do love; For we do know we shall not lack Thy presence from above; For thou hast promis'd to the end To us that will be near, And be to us a faithful Friend, Which makes us not to fear Whatever Men or Devils do In secret place design; For soon canst thou them overthrow, And help all Souls of thine. The Resurrection of the Dead We constantly maintain, When all those who lye buried Shall rise to life again; And that the Judgment-day will come, When Christ upon the Throne Shall pass a black eternal doom Upon each wicked one: But all his Saints then joyfully With bowels he'll embrace, And Crowns to all eternity Upon their Heads he'll place; And in the Kingdom shall they reign Prepared long before, And also shall with Christ remain In bliss for evermore. HYMN 108. [O Blessed Lamb of God, shall I] 1 Cor. 5. 7. For Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. O Blessed Lamb of God, shall I Forget that love of thine! Thy life, O Lord, thou didst give up To save this Soul of mine. Most harmless Lamb, and innocent, When come to a ripe age, Ah! then didst thou thy life give up God's anger to asswage. Thy Blood is sprinkled on our Doors, Or rather on our Hearts, To shew God hath our sins pass'd o're, And Mercies he imparts. The Lamb it was roasted with fire, Thou didst God's wrath sustain; And on thee we by Faith do feed, And life thereby obtain. The Lamb was eat with bitter Herbs, So let us see our sin, And find it bitter unto us, It so to thee has been; And so let us thy Praises sing Whilst thus we feast with thee, And with one heart exalt our King In all sincerity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VI. Containing divers SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth The Nature, Work, Office, and Excellencies of the holy Angels, and the Spirit or Soul of Man. HYMN 109. [The holy Angels have a charge] Dan. 4. 17. This matter is by the decree of the Watchers. [The First Part.] The holy Angels have a charge To watch continually; They do not sleep, but evermore Have us in their sweet eye. They have a charge to keep us here, And compass us about, And warning give oft-times also When trouble's breaking out. Watch men are useful in the night, They dangers do prevent; So Angels useful are to those Unto whom they are sent. Was not Elisha safe whilst he Was compassed quite round With these blest Chariots and Horsemen Who did his Foes confound? O what are we, most holy God, That thou shouldst take such care Of us who so unworthy be, And sinful Creatures are! The Second Part. Behold the Angels of the Lord Do encompass round about All them that fear him, for their Guard, To keep all dangers out; For he hath giv'n his Angels charge To keep thee day by day, That thou mayst walk abroad at large With safety in thy way; For they this charge must execute, And bear thee in their Arms, Lest ever thou shouldst dash thy feet Against a stone for harm; For are they not all Ministers Sent forth for ministration In their behalf, that shall be Heirs Of God's assur'd Salvation? Ye Saints, behold the Love of God, And sing his Praises forth; No wicked Prince has such a Guard As th'meanest Saint on Earth. HYMN 110. [How glorious are the Morning Stars] Job 38. 7. When the Morning-stars sang together, &amp;c. [The First Part.] How glorious are the Morning Stars! How doth their glory shine! Angels most glorious Creatures are, Yea, holy and divine: They sang together at the first Jehovah's glorious praise, And we of them also learn must To sing to God always; Nay, with united voices sing In Consort with much joy, Since Christ has overcome our Foes, Who would our Souls destroy: And did they not a second time Sing unto God on high, When Jesus Christ our Lord was born? And yet shall Saints deny This is our work? No, no, it doth Sharply indeed reprove Such who would rob the holy God Of that which he doth love. It is his due, and it belongs To him as his just Right; His Praise to celebrate in Songs Is lovely in his sight. Psalm 89. Thy Mercies, Lord, then we will sing, Thy Truth to all proclaim; The heav'nly Angels sacred Choir Shall celebrate the same. These never with the Lord dispute, Nor his Commands contest, But give attendance at his Throne, With awful fear possess'd. HYMN 111. [Sons in their Father do rejoyce] Job 38. 8. And all the Sons of God shouted for joy. Sons in their Father do rejoyce, Whose Off-spring all they be, And hence the Angels lift their voice In Songs, Lord, unto thee, By whom they all created were, And on whom they attend, And from whom all their dignity Doth unto them descend: They cloathed are like unto Sons With might and glorious power, And serve the Lord most willingly, With greatest zeal each hour: One part of their sweet work's to sing To God melodiously, And we by them also are taught To sing continually. Then as God's will is done by them, Let us do it on Earth; Like flames of fire let us be, And sing God's Praises forth. HYMN 112. [The glorious God, the Lord above] Gen. 32. 1. This is God's Host, &amp;c. The glorious God, the Lord above, Hath a most mighty Host, Who have a Prince their General, Of whom they daily boast: Christ is their Head, he's Head of all Princ'palities and Powrs, And these do keep and save the Saints From him that Souls devours. This mighty Host and Army's rais'd Under their Prince to fight, And one of them hath thousands slain Of Rebels in a night. This Host sometimes does suddenly Vile Sinners so invade By Plague and Famine, and by War, That all are soon dismaid. They slaughtering Weapons have each some, And Execution do; And as Commission they receive, They saved or do o'rethrow. HYMN 113. [The Face of a Man has majesty] Ezek 1. 6, 10. And every one had four Faces, the Face of a Man, of a Lion, of an Oxe, and of an Eagle. The Face of a Man has majesty, And shews a Soul doth dwell In him that hath rare faculties, In knowledge doth excell: So Angels look with awful frowns When they in wrath appear, And are endu'd with wisdom great Beyond what Mortals are. Th'Face of a Man also denotes What beauty is in them, Who are most glorious in themselves, And so in our esteem. Face of a Lion shews their strength, A Lion is so strong That he will turn away from none, Nor fears he any wrong. Face of an Oxe may signifie How painful they all be, And any service patiently Perform, O Lord, for thee. An Eagle hath a piercing Eye, And swift she is in flight; The Angels do God's Face behold, And fly with greatest might. HYMN 114. [Angels as swift as Air, as bright] Psal. 104. 4. He maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers a flaming Fire. Angels as swift as Air, as bright As Flames, with quick obedience move, To publish and effect below That charge given to them above. As Fire burns and doth consume, So th'Seraphims signifie A burning to shew what zeal's in them Who do attend on God most high: And also how with flaming zeal, When they from God Commission have, They do break forth at his dread Word To kill his Foes, his Saints to save. Let wicked ones amazed stand, Who can escape a flaming Fire; Let Saints also do God's Command With zeal, like to the heavenly Quire: And let them learn likewise from hence What comfort this to them may bring; These Angels come for your defence Swift, like to Flames, or Eagles Wings. HYMN 115. [A horse is strong, and nothing fears] Zach. 1. 8. Behold a Man upon a red Horse, and behind him were red Horses, speckled, and white. A horse is strong, and nothing fears, And swift they are to run, Angels are cloath'd with mighty strength, And fly like to the Sun. Horses and Chariots of Fire do Shew how fierce and agil The glorious Angels are always In doing of God's Will. By Horses red thou dost, Lord shew Those dreadful slaughters they Do make of Men, when thou bids them Ezek. 9. 2, 4.Go forth with Swords and slay. By speckled Horses thou mak'st known A mix'd Dispensation, When Mercy mingled is with Wrath In any sinful Nation. The white Horses notes that sweet peace Which thou at last will send; For Wars on Earth thou wilt make cease Before the Worlds end: And that in Christ's dread Government He Angels oft doth use; And they are often also sent To shew what next ensues. HYMN 116. [Once was our Candle lighted, Lord] Prov. 20. 27. The Spirit of a Man is the Candle of the Lord, &amp;c. Once was our Candle lighted, Lord, And did most clearly burn; But soon did Satan blow it out, And we were all undone: Left in the darkness of the night, And were bewilder'd so, That we for want of thy sweet light Knew not which way to go. O let our Candle lighted be! O light it once again, And by it search to find out sin Which may in us remain. 'Tis thou must light our Candle, Lord, With th'Fire of thy Grace; O let it burn and ne're go out Till we have run our race; That in thy sight we may see light, And thereby may rejoyce, And sing thy Praises day and night With heart and chearful voice. HYMN 117. [Conscience a Witness is, O Lord] Rom. 9. 1. My Conscience bearing witness in the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Conscience a Witness is, O Lord, Of all we do and say, And such who sin against their Light, He will the matter lay Before the Soul, because he knows The Thoughts of each Man's Heart, And never will be brib'd by them, Nor from his Charge depart. How careful should each Person be They do not him offend; For if God's Word doth side with him, It will appear i'th' end; The Soul as Guilty will be found, And Cast too shall such be, And by the Judge Condemn'd also To all eternity; Then wo to such who treach'rously Their Conscience do abuse, Or stifle him whom God thinks good In this great Case to use Ev'n as a Witness for himself In ev'ry Man's own Heart, To Evidence to Matter of Fact, And Judgment to impart, As God's true Witness, for to clear Him who would judge aright, And make it also to appear So in each Man's own sight. The Second Part. Then look to it, ye Sinners, who Your Conscience stifle now; For he against you will be call'd One day, and make you bow; And though you think to silence him, So that he cannot speak, Yet in the Judgment-day he'll rouse, And make your hearts to ake. If you live not up to your Light, Then fear what will ensue; For when he doth receive more sight, He quickly will renew His dread Commission from the Lord, And you condemn'd shall be; If he accuses by God's Word, No help there is for thee, Unless thou dost leave off thy sin, To end the bitter strife, He'll make thee quickly to cry out, As weary of thy life. But O how happy is the Man That Conscience by God's Word Doth quite discharge from guilt of sin In sight of the bless'd Lord! From this great Witness none can fly, He will also appear At the last day, and will accuse, Or otherwise will clear. HYMN 118. [If Conscience is become my Friend] The Third Part. Sing this as the Hundredth Psalm. If Conscience is become my Friend, And chearfully doth speak to me, And I do to his motions bend, No matter though I hated be: No matter 'tis who doth revile, If Conscience doth his witness bear For us, and doth upon us smile, Most easie will all things appear. If Conscience now doth give us rest, And from all burthens sets us free, Again we would not be opprest In the old bonds of misery, For Kingdoms, nor for Crowns of Gold, Such inward joy doth he afford, That nothing can the same unfold, It so aboundeth in the Lord. 'Tis Conscience which with peecious Food Doth feed God's Saints continually; Its Dainties also are so good, All other Sweets they do defie. This Banquet lasting is also, 'Tis here they feast both night and day, With all supplies they meet with do, And none their joys can take away. 'Tis Conscience which doth chearful make When Saints possessed are with grief; And when they suffer for his sake, He brings them joy and sweet relief. The Fourth Part. When Troubles rise and do encrease, And Sinners to the Mountains fly, Conscience to Saints doth speak much peace, And makes them sing when they do die. When others do amazed stand, A place of shelter, Lord, have we, And Conscience will lend us a hand, That we may hide our selves in thee; And in safe Chambers lock us up Whilst all the Troubles here shall last, And free us from the bitter cup 'Till all the indignation's past. At Death, and in the Judgment-day, What would Men give for such a Friend? All those which do him disobey, They'll find themselves undone it'th'end. How will such Souls repent too late, And wofully will howl and cry! But whilst such do condole their fate, Our Souls shall sing continually In joyful Hymns unto our God, Who has preserved us from harms, And ever will protect us still From Satan's base alluring Charms. The End of the Sixth Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VII. Containing several SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth The Glory of God's CHURCH: Likewise Of Afflictions, the Day of Grace; And of the four last things, viz. Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell. HYMN 119. [Glorious things are spread abroad] Psal. 87. 3. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of God. Glorious things are spread abroad Of Sion, far and near, That blessed City of our God, Whose beauty is most rare: There is a quiet stream makes glad The City of the Lord; His presence will secure her peace, And timely help afford. Her Building is of Precious-stone, Her Foundation's sure; No Jasper ever hath so shone Like it, it is so pure. 'Tis God who did this City raise, And he will it repair, That it may be to his high praise, Himself also dwells there: It is his Dwelling-place below, The Palace of our King; And all great Kings shall Gifts bestow, To make her glory ring Throughout the Earth, to such degree Shall she her beauty spread; Her glory shall by great and small Be much admired. Then sing, ye Saints, lift up your voice, Who do in Sion dwell; What People like unto you are, O happy Israel! HYMN 120. [Now even will I sing a Song] Isa. 5. 1. Now will I sing to my Well-beloved a Song of my Beloved, touching his Vineyard, &amp;c. [The First Part.] Now even will I sing a Song To my Beloved dear, A Song of his own Vineyard 'tis Which he hath planted here. My Beloved he a Vineyard hath In a most fruitful Hill, And he also fenc'd it about With care and greatest skill: He planted it with the choice Vine, And built a Tower too, Where he doth dwell, who is divine, This doth its glory show. A Wine Press too he made therein, Which Wine pours forth amain, Of which he doth delight to drink, Due glory to obtain. 'Twas to this end he took such pains, And such great cost laid out; 'Twas for his praise, and for our good 'Twas planted without doubt. He gathered also out the stones Which did the same annoy, And did preserve it ev'ry day, That none might it destroy. The Second Part. And then he looked it should bring Forth Grapes both sweet and good, But ah! it was a grievous thing If rightly understood, That after all his cost and pains It should wild Grapes bring forth, When no Vineyard was like to it Planted in all the Earth. But hark now what the Lord doth say The Hedge I'll take away, And also waste I will it lay To evil Beasts of prey; For what, alas, could he do more For it than he hath done! And doth it still wild Grapes bring forth? This made his wrath to burn Within his Breast, and therefore did Resolve for to restrain The precious Clouds that watered it With sweet and blessed Rain: Or make his Ministers who preach His good and holy Word, Useless to it, so that they might To it no good afford. O then, ye Saints take heed and fear Lest you should barren prove; For if you do, God may from you His presence quite remove: But if that you who are his Church Bring forth the Fruit of Grace, He never will deal with you thus, Your glory to deface. HYMN 121. [Ev'ry natural Body hath] 1 Cor. 10. 15. All baptized into one Body. Col. 1. 18. He is the Head of the Body, the Church. [The First Part.] Ev'ry natural Body hath A Head, and hath but one; The Head, Lord, of thy Church thou art, Thou art her Head alone. And all her Members joyned be To thee in sacred bonds, And influence they have from thee, In thee her glory stands. And all Members of the Body are Of use unto the whole, So of some use unto thy Church Is every gracious Soul Who is a Member of the same; If any rotten are, And past all hope of being heal'd, No being must have there, But off they must be cut with speed, Lest worser dangers fall; For one polluted Member may Even soon corrupt them all. The Second Part. Wo unto him who shall attempt This Body to divide, Or make a Schism, 'tis all one, With piercing of Christ's side; For O the nearness that's between The Body and the Head, Don't cut Christ's Veins, remember well What once he suffered. O wound him not again, I say, His Body don't annoy; If it you mangle, he will you For evermore destroy: But see that ev'ry one doth seek To do good to each other, And pity take continually Of the poorest Brother. O live in love, and see how near You to each other are, And equally your Duties do, And nothing do you fear. HYMN 122. [Thy Church, Lord, in her self is poor] Exod. 3. 2. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of Fire out of the midst of a Bush. Thy Church, Lord, in her self is poor, Like to a Bramble dry; 'Tis, Lord, in thee, in thee alone Doth all her glory lye. But though a Bush, yet in it thou Dost dwell for evermore, And therefore she is not consum'd Ev'n now as heretofore. This Bush long time on fire has been, O 'tis a wond'rous sight, Though in the fire, yet not burn'd, This may our Souls invite To take a view, as Moses did, O why is this thing so? Alas, thy Church is dear to thee, Beyond all things below! O then let all those precious Birds Who in this Bush are hid, Sing forth thy praise continually, And none their Souls forbid. The time of singing, O 'tis come, Since the sweet Turtle-Dove Did let us hear, in this our Land, His voice from Heav'n above. HYMN 123. [Thy Churches, Lord, are like unto] Rev. 1. 20. The Golden Candle-sticks are the seven Churches. Thy Churches, Lord, are like unto Rich Candle-sticks of Gold, In whom shines forth that glorious light Which Sinners do behold. Those Candlesticks which are so rich Are seldom to be found But in the House of a great Prince, Whose glory is renown'd. This shews the Churches of the Saints Do, Lord, belong to thee, Who art the glorious King of Kings, They useful also be, As Candlesticks in a large House, In which the Light they place; And also are for Ornament Ev'n thus, through thine own Grace, Are all thy Churches here on Earth Of use, Lord, unto thee, And unto others, who likewise Thy Riches in them see. Thy Candlesticks then don't remove, But let their Light so shine, That all the Earth may lighted be Into all Truths of thine. HYMN 124. [Thy Church is like a Flock of Sheep] Luk. 12. 32. Fear not little Flock, &amp;c. Thy Church is like a Flock of Sheep, Whose number is but small, Which thou thy self dost always keep, And wilt preserve them all. Thy Saints, like Sheep, are innocent, Most harmless, also meek; If any of them go astray, 'Tis thou who dost them seek. Thou also dost them feed and lead In Pastures flourishing, And hast for them a resting-place, Besides the Water-spring. They subject are for to get Soyl, But thou dost wash them in The Fountain of thy precious Blood, From ev'ry stain of sin. As Sheep are fruitful, so thy Church And Children are, O Lord; They honour bring to thee, and then To Men profit afford. Fear not, ye Saints, tho' Wolves abound, And other Beasts of prey; For Christ will keep you safe and sound Unto the Judgment-day: And you the Kingdom shall receive, Rejoyce and sing therefore; Keep close to Christ, and mind the Flock Which follow'd him before. HYMN 125. [Ah! what mean and despis'd things] Job 25. 6. The Son of Man a Worm. Ah! what mean and despis'd things Are Worms that crawl on Earth! Man is a Worm, he from Earth sprung, From thence were we brought forth. No, beauty in a sorry Worm, Man's glory that is gone, Contemptible is in thy sight, Each vile and wicked one. What can a Worm do to preserve It self from hurt or wrong, That is in danger by each foot? So we are all day long. We can't preserve our selves one day, Our Life is but a blast; And one small sin, if not purg'd out, May damn the Soul at last. Then do not pride it in your selves, You to the Worms must go; For all your beauty soon will fly, You must corruption know. HYMN 126. [On Earth our days will be but few] Job 14. 2. He fleeth also as a shadow, and abideth not. On Earth our days will be but few, Like as the shadow flies; Or like unto the Morning-Dew, Doth pass when Sun doth rise; So do our Days, our Months, and Years, Make haste to fly away, Much like the Blossom he appears, Which quickly doth decay; Or like the Flower in the Spring, Whose beauty's very rare; And as the Birds in Summer sing, We may our selves compare. The glory of the Flowers fail, The Summer ends also; The Birds do then themselves bewail, And know not what to do. The Blossom withers soon away, Like Jonah's Gourd 'tis gone; So we sprout up, and shall not stay, Our lives will soon be done. HYMN 127. [If we are Children of the Lord] Rom. 8. 17. If Children, then Heirs. If we are Children of the Lord By being born again, Then are we also Heirs with Christ, And with him we shall reign. He that's an Heir to a great King, He is a Prince by birth; And so is each true Child of God, The holy Scripture faith. The Heir shall the Inheritance At last Possession have, And so shall all Believers too The Crown at last receive. But as the Heir must wait awhile Until he comes to age, So must we all with patience wait Till we have run our stage. The Heir is likely richly cloath'd, Whereby it is he's known; So all God's Saints with holiness Are cloathed ev'ry one. The Heir, as the Birth-right of old, The Blessing had always; So all the Saints chief Blessings have, And therefore sing God's praise. HYMN 128. [He that the Prize doth think to have] 1 Cor. 9. So run that ye may obtain. He that the Prize doth think to have, Must take the greatest care To set out timely, must begin Before old age draws near. He that would win the Prize also, Must know what way to run; And must hold out, not weary be, Until the Prize he's won. All weights he must cast off with speed, And temp'rate also be, Or else he'll faint, and never will God's blessed Kingdom see. Such who do run a race, sometimes Have many Lookers on; Both Men and Angels view the Saints, And mind how they do run. They who do run an earthly Race, Run for some earthly thing; But ev'ry Saint that gains the Prize, Shall Crown'd be as a King. O then, ye Saints, run you apace In ways of Piety; Gird up your Loyns, and nothing fear, Look up, lift up your Eye The Prize to see: Ah! 'tis your own, And when you end your days, You shall receive it, therefore now Break sorth and sing God's praise. HYMN 129. [Lord, we are Pilgrims on the Earth] Heb. 11. 13. They confessed they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth. Lord, we are Pilgrims on the Earth, As all our Fathers were; For this is not our dwelling-place, No 'biding for us here. As Pilgrims go up hill and down, And meet with troubles do; So, Lord, thy Saints, while they are here, Do many sorrows know. A Pilgrim is a Stranger in Those places where he lyes, And therefore is not taken with Those things which he espyes, Or doth behold where he doth come: What are these things to me? Saith a poor Saint; I must be gone, I better things do see. A Pilgrim loves good company, Don't care to go alone; So do God's Saints delight in such Who do Christ Jesus own; And walk with them in the same way, If that they be sincere, They prize their precious company, They helpful to each are. A Pilgrim, when he's come near home, He greatly doth rejoyce; O let such Saints whose work's near done, Lift up with joy their voice. HYMN 130. [Lord, if we do thy Word transgress] Job 9. 34. Let him take his Rod from me. Lord, if we do thy Word transgress, And against thee offend, Thou wilt chastise us, more or less, By tryals thou dost send: But thou wilt not thy love remove, Thy Covenant is sure; 'Tis but our Souls to try and prove To make us all more pure. Fathers, we know, have divers Rods, And as the offence may be, They lighter or the heavier strike, And so likewise doth he. 'Tis always for our good we know He puts our Souls to grief, And thou great bowels, Lord, dost show, And sends us then relief. O then, ye Saints, don't think it strange That God his Rod doth use, But bear it, and give praise to him, And mark what next ensues. After he hath you try'd, ye shall Come forth like pure Gold, And in Afflictions to you all God will his love unfold. HYMN 131. [Darkness sometimes, Lord, doth invade] Lam. 3. 2. And brought me into darkness. Darkness sometimes, Lord, doth invade The Children of the Day; Yet we should, when we want sweet Light, Our Souls upon thee stay. The Sun sometimes is hid from us, And then with us 'tis Night; So Darkness doth upon us seize, When we have lost the sight Of thee, O Lord, if thou art hid, That we can't see thy face; O then 'tis night, and we bewail Our sad and woful case. But though dark Clouds do cover us, And we are in the night; Yet will our Sun rise up and shine, And we shall have sweet light. But O how sad and comfortless Is it i'th' dark to dwell! But what's the darkness Saints see here, To th'darkness that's in Hell! Then do not mourn, ye gracious Souls, Your darkness soon will fly, And you shall precious Light enjoy Unto eternity. HYMN 132. [Sad Storms and Tempests we expect] Isa. 4. 6. A Covert from the Storm, &amp;c. Sad Storms and Tempests we expect Whilst Winter-days do last; And so do Saints, whilst they are here, Look for a piercing blast. As by some certain Signs Men know A Storm is very near, So do thy Saints, O Lord, likewise Foresee their troubles here; And therefore should prepare for them By warning thou dost give, And carefully their lives amend, And all more godly live: And also with the greatest care Haste to their hiding-place By Faith and Prayer get into thee; For whilst they see thy face, And do enjoy thy presence sweet, They nothing need to fear; But we, alas, through unbelief, Astonish'd often are. But let us know, O Lord, we pray, That Ship can nevr sink In which the blessed Jesus is, Whatever we may think. In this also much comfort lyes, Thou canst the Winds command, And still the Seas, and make a calm By thy own mighty hand. HYMN 133. [The Floods, O Lord, the Floods do rise] Psal. 42. 7. All thy Floods and Waves are gone over me. The Floods, O Lord, the Floods do rise, They roar, and make a noise; The Floods break out and swell amain, And do lift up their voice. There's many Waters we do see That threaten us full sore; The wicked rage and swell in wrath, O Lord, still more and more. They all conspire with one heart How they may thee withstand; Arise, O Lord, and take our part, They are in league and band. The Tents of all the Edomites, The Ishmaelites also, The Hagarens and the Moabites, With divers others too. Gebal with Amon, and likewise Doth Amaleck conspire; The Philistines against thee rise, With them that dwell at Tyre. O thou who sits upon the Floods To rule and govern all, Break forth upon thine Enemies, And give them their last fall. HYMN 134. [One grief, and then another doth] The Second Part. One grief, and then another doth Like Clouds their Waters pour; The Floods of cursed evil Men Do threaten to devour Thy People all: O Lord, look down! Rebuke them in thy wrath! Thou art our hope and our defence, O stretch thine Arm now forth, And let them know they are but Men, And must subject to thee; What evil they intend to do, Let it prevented be; And we will lift thy Name on high, And them we will not fear, If thou wilt, Lord, our sins forgive, And for our help appear. HYMN 135. [To day, O hear God's gracious Call] Heb. 3. 7. To day if you will hear his voice. To day, O hear God's gracious Call, O don't the time delay! The morrow you must not boast of, 'Tis now whilst 'tis to day. Night is no time to do work in, And Night will soon be here; O then repent and leave your sin I. To Jesus lend your Ear. To Day, whilst the sweet Sun doth shine, O hearken to God's Word! Now whilst you have the Means of Grace, Turn ye unto the Lord. The Morning of your Day is gone, Nay 'tis already Noon; The Evening too is coming on, And here it will be soon. Your Sun begins to draw full low, And quickly will go down; Rouze up and do your work apace, Before your Day is gone. HYMN 136. [That Soul, O Lord, in whom's begun] Mat. 12. 20. A bruised Reed shall he not break, and smoaking Flax shall he not quench. That Soul, O Lord, in whom's begun The blessed work of Grace, Tho' he may droop, and broken be, Yet shall behold thy face. The feeble and desponding Soul That's like a bruised Reed, Thou wilt; Lord, take pity upon, And soon supply his need. Altho' he's like to smoaking Flax, Where little fire is seen; Yet he shall see that work go on Which shall destroy his sin. Grace at the first seems to be small, Which makes the Soul to doubt, That in him there is none at all, Yet thou wilt bring him out Of all his fears, and he shall have A glorious victory, And triumph shall in Songs of Praise To all eternity. HYMN 137. [Like as the Seed which Men do sow] 1 Cor. 15. 36. Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not quickned, unless it die. [The First Part.] Like as the Seed which Men do sow Some time lyes in the Earth; And then it sprours, and we all see A Resurrection hath. And as the Seed, unless it die, It is not quickened; So we first die, and afterwards Are raised from the dead. Death doth approach, all Men must die, And turn unto the dust; The Grave that is the House for all, And thither go we must. Uncertain is the time of death, 'Tis certain all must die; And certain 'tis when death doth come, Comes in eternity. No Mortal can himself deliver From th'power of the Grave; And as we die, so we are sure Another life to have. The Second Part. The Resurrection-day will come, When we shall rise again; Remember well the Day of Doom, And where you must remain; For if in sin at last you die, To Hell you shall be cast; But if in Christ you fall asleep, Your happiness will last For evermore; you shall then be With Christ and holy Men, Where you shall with the Angels sing All praise to God, Amen. Blessed are they who in the Lord At last do come to die; For as all such from labour rest, So shall assuredly At the great day, when Christ appears, Appear in glory bright, And in God's Kingdom shall henceforth Shine like the Morning light. Then do not mourn for such who die In Christ their dearest Friend; Their gain is great, of all their grief There is a final end. HYMN 138. [Death is a sleep, it is a rest] 1 Thess. 4. 14. Them that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him. Death is a sleep, it is a rest From all our labour here, And to the Saints it is the best, And so it will appear They fall asleep in a sweet place, They sleep in Jesus do; They Union have with him through Grace, Which death can't overthrow. Death can't dissolve that blessed Knot, That union doth remain, And unto Jesus Christ do go, Death unto Saints is gain. But though the Sinner falls asleep, His sleep is troublesome; His Spirits shall no rest receive Till the last day doth come; But under wrath and dreadful Ire His Spirit then shall lye; When death dos come, he feels Hell-fire, He sleeps in misery. 'Tis but one part that taketh rest, That Sleep too soon will o're, When God will on Body and Soul Eternal vengeance pour. HYMN 139. [Depart from what? and whither go?] Phil. 1. 13. Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, &amp;c. Depart from what? and whither go? But why art in such haste? O 'tis because thou well didst know How sweet Christ's love doth taste. Depart from Earth, and go to Heav'n, From Saints that dwell below, To them to whom bless'd Crowns are given, Who do no sorrow know. Depart from Sin and Suffering, To go to lasting bliss; From being Poor, to be a King! What change is there like this? But yet thou must wait till the time That God prefixed hath; And then thou shalt depart in peace, And have the end of Faith. O happy Man, thou art the Lord's, Let death come when it will: And he thy precious Soul at last Will with his glory fill. HYMN 140. [The Morning comes when Night is gone] Psal. 49. 14. And the Righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning. The Morning comes when Night is gone, The Night is now far spent; The Resurrection day comes on, When Jesus shall be sent To call the Dead out of their Graves, That is the Morning sure Which will not have another Night, That Day will last for ever. Thy Sun will rise, and ne're go down, And then thou shalt awake Out of thy Bed, and have a Crown That will thee happy make. Thou wast of no esteem on Earth, But a poor Underlin; But shalt at last dominion have When that day doth begin. It will a Morning be in which No Clouds shall more appear; Thy Sun shall rise, and shine he shall Beyond all shinings here. O wait, ye Saints, then for the Morn! Look up, it is ev'n day! Break forth and sing all Saints of God, Who dwell in House of Clay: Your day doth hasten on apace, Look up, lift up your Eyes, The Morning comes when you shall rule O're all your Enemies. HYMN 141. [Hark how the mighty Trumpet sounds] Rev. 20. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the Books were opened, &amp;c. Hark how the mighty Trumpet sounds, The Judge is on the Throne! Now joy to Saints shall much abound, But hark how Sinners groan! Now, now the Books shall opened be, The Judgment-day is come; And Christ will judge impartially, And Sinners shall be dumb; Nothing to say: Ah! no excuse! All silent, all are mute, And shall the Sentence now receive, Which wrath will execute. Rejoyce, ye Saints, for Christ will say, O Come who are blessed! Ye blessed of my Father, now With joy lift up your head, And take the Kingdom long prepar'd For you: But ah! alas! The wicked then will houl and cry To see their woful case. HYMN 142. Of Heaven. 2 Tim. 4. 8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, &amp;c. No sooner shall the Judgment end, But Saints shall crowned be, And shine they shall in glorious Robes Unto eternity. Then shall we see the blessed One Who crowned was with Thorns, Who shed for us his precious Blood, Whose Heart was broke with scorns: Him whom our Souls so dearly love, We all shall shortly see With open face, and shall above With him for ever be. That Man that here met with disgrace, We there shall see so bright, That Angels can't behold his face For its exceeding light. What gladness will possess our heart When we shall see these things! For light and life in ev'ry part Will rise like lasting Springs. Next unto Christ we shall behold Saints Souls in glory shine, Whose Bodies shall be made like his, All glorious, all divine. HYMN 143. [Each Saint shall then shine more or less] The Second Part. Each Saint shall then shine more or less In Crowns excelling Gold, Triumph they shall in heavenly bliss Amazing to behold; And each of them in majesty Shall represent a King; Yea, Angel-like for dignity, And shall with Cherubs sing: Immortal are they ev'ry one, And shine like to the Sun; Their glory also shall abide, Their day shall ne're be done: Their Bodies which sometimes were torn, And Bones that broken were, For Jesus's sake he will adorn With health and glory fair. They shall also with Angels then Joyn in sweet harmony, To sing and celebrate God's praise Unto eternity. This we shall hear, this we shall see, While raptured in bliss, When we with blessed Jesus be; What happiness like this? HYMN 144. [Our Friends that lived Godly here] The Third Part Our Friends that lived Godly here Shall there be found again; Ah! we shall meet, and then we shall Together all remain. This is the place, this is the state Of all that are sincere, Which Men nor Angels can relate, So great's the glory there. Grace here doth tune our hearts and tongues For heav'nly harmony, That sing we may with Angels all Unto eternity. Here run the Chrystal streams of Life Quite thorough all our Veins; Grace doth our Souls to God unite, Like glorious Golden Chains: We here are made both fit and meet For that Inheritance, Where we shall reign triumphantly, And have preheminence. Now that which sweeter [illeg.] is this, Our glory will remain; No end will there be of our bliss, When we begin to raign. In hopes of that high glory [illeg.] Break forth, ye Saints, and sing And also live unto the praise Of your most glorious King. HYMN 145. Of Hell. Mark 9. 46. Where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched. When Saints shall glorified be, The Sinners pangs excell; When Saints shall all in Heaven sing, Sinners shall houl in Hell. The foolish Sinner little thinks What sorrows will abound Within himself, when on the brink Of Tophet he is found. Hell is, alas, beyond all thought So frightful, and forlorn; No mortal Creature can relate The pangs that there are born. God will exclude them evermore From his most blessed face: And them involve in misery, In shame, and in disgrace. God is the Fountain of all Good, Of Life, of Light and peace; They then must needs be wretched all Who are depriv'd of these. Unto a dreadful burning Lake All on a fiery flame Hell is compared; wo to them Who once do feel the same. HYMN 146. [No light, but darkness there doth dwell!] The Second Part. No light, but darkness there doth dwell! No peace, but horror strange: Ah! they who once do come to Hell, Will find a dismal change; A fiery Lake, a Furnace hot, A Burning Oven too It is compared in God's Word, And thither Sinners go. And further, God to shew their state Who in their sins do die, Compares it to burning Brimstone, To shew their misery. And as a stinking steam and smoak Of Brimstone bad does smell, And blinds the Eyes, and Stomach choaks, So are the pangs of Hell. To see a Sea of Brimstone burn, Would it you not affright? But they whom God to Hell doth turn, Are in a worser plight. This burning cannot quenched be, No, not with Tears of Blood; No mournful groans in misery Will there do any good. O damned Sinners see your fate, The Day of Grace is done; Repentance now is much too late, All mercy's fled and gone. The Second Part. Hell a Prison. 1 Pet. 3. 19. The Spirits in Prison. Hell also, in another place, Is call'd a Prison too; And all to snew the woful case Of such sin doth undo: Which Prison, with its Lock and Barrs Of God's lasting Decree, Will hold them fast; O how this marrs All thoughts of being free. Out of these brazen Barrs may they The Saints in glory see; But this will not their grief allay, But to them torment be. Those Chains that darkness on them hangs, Still ratling in their Ears, Creates within them heavy pangs, And still augments their Tears. Thus hopeless of all remedy, They dyingly do sink Into the Jaws of Misery, And Seas of Sorrows drink; For being fill'd on every side With helplesness and grief, Headlong into despair they slide, Bereft of all relief. The Third Part. Hell a bottomless Pit. And Hell also is call'd a Pit. Prepar'd for those that die The Second Death, a term most fit To shew their misery. A Pit that's bottomless is this, A Gulph of grief and woe, A Dungeon which they cannot miss, That will them quite undo. Thus without stay they always sink, Thus fainting till they fail; Despair they up like water drink, These Prisoners have no Bail. Here meets them now that Worm that gnaws, And plucks their Bowels out; The pit too on them shuts her Jaws, This dreadful is no doubt. This ghastly Worm is guilt of sin, Which on their Conscience feeds, With Vipers Teeth both sharp and keen, Whereat it sorely bleeds. This Worm is fed by memory, Which strictly brings to mind All things done in their Body here, As we in Scripture find. Their Conscience is the Slaughter-shop, There hangs the Axe and Knife; 'Tis there the Worm doth them torment, With most egregious strife. They sooner may drink up the Sea Than shake off these their fears, Or make another in one day As big with brinish tears. They sooner may the Stars account Than loose their dismal bands, Or tell the number of their Hairs, Or number of the Sands Of the Sea-shore, as see the end Of their sad misery; O Sinners fear and tremble all! Think on Eternity. The End of the Seventh Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VIII. SACRED HYMNS of Praise, on several Occasions: As they have been sung in several Congregations. HYMN 147. Sin laid upon Christ. Lo, Christ hath suffer'd for us all When Enemies we were, Therefore we will thy Name extoll, Whose love did thus appear; For we like Sheep have gone astray, And ready were to fall; And God hath lain the load on thee, To give rest to us all. Thy precious Praises therefore, Lord, Sincerely let us sing, And laud thy Name with one accord, O God and heavenly King; For all thy loving-kindness, Lord, And for thy truth divine; For thou hast made thy holy Word O're all thy Name to shine. Help us to praise thee, and to live Wholly alone to thee, And not forget from whence doth come Our present liberty. O shine upon thy Church always, And bless our joynt-endeavour; And prosper thou our handy-work Now and the same for ever. HYMN 148. To be sung after the Lord's Supper. The good Physician. Thy love, O Lord, was very great To such vile ones as we; Our hearts were once dead as a stone, But now they quickned be. Slight Balm may heal a slighter sore, But there's no Med'cine good Which can to life our Souls restore, But the Physician's Blood. Lord Jesus when we thee espy, Though life is almost gone, We see by Faith we shall not die, All praise to thee alone Who hast pour'd in sweet Oyl and Wine To heal each wounded heart; O thou wilt heal all Souls of thine, Who for their sakes didst smart. We therefore will unto thee sing, And thee always adore; To him from whom all Blessings spring Be praise for evermore. HYMN 149. A Hymn of Praise after the Lord's Supper. The Banqueting-House. Halleluja let us sing aloud, Salvation, Glory, Fame, Be given to the Lord our God, O glorifie his Name, Who loved us, and sent his Son For our eternal good, To wash away our scarlet sins In his most precious Blood. Into the House of Banqueting He brings us to be fed, Love is the Banner flourishing VVith honour o're our head. Beneath his shadow we are plac'd VVith joy and true content; His Fruit is sweet unto our taste, His VVord and Sacrament. O draw me my dear Saviour then VVith thy strong Cords of Love, And we will all run after thee As fast as we can move: And in thy Name, O Lord, we'll trust, For that's a Tower strong, Whither the Righteous oft doth fly For shelter all day long. HYMN 150. Divine Wrath. The day doth come, and burn it will Like to an Oven hot; And all the proud shall be Fuel Who have the Lord forgot: Nay it begins now to break forth, And will burn more and more; On all the wicked of the Earth God will his vengeance pour. Evil shall slay the wicked Man For sin which he hath wrought; And such who hate God's faithful Ones, Shall quickly come to nought. But all who do fear thee, O Lord, Thou wilt keep safe and sound; And such who put their trust in thee, Thou never wilt confound, But save them in the day of wrath, The which is very nigh, When all the wicked of the Earth In direful Flames shall lye. HYMN 151. . A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament The Bread of Life. With precious Food, Lord, we are fed, Which we have cause to prize; Our Table is most richly spread With choice Varieties. The harmless Lamb most innocent For us is ready slain, And we as Guests are hither sent To seed on him again. But O what Love and Grace is here! When we were hungry, Christ's Body, Lord, thou didst prepare That for us he might die; For nothing but his Flesh and Blood Could our poor Souls sustain; Therefore, O Lord, thou didst cry forth, O let my Lamb be slain. O let his precious Blood run out, For to them it I'll give, Or else they'll perish without doubt; 'Tis done; Come, eat, and live! Eat, eat, O Friends, on what is good, And drink abundantly; The best of Heav'n is your Food, No fatness I deny. O Lord, thy Love is very sweet, And we therefore do cry, O feed us with this precious Food Untill we come to die. And we will sing thy Praises, Lord, Even both rich and poor; And to the blessed Lamb we'll sing Praises for evermore. HYMN 152. A Hymn of Praise after the Lord Supper. Saints die with Christ. All glory unto Christ the Lord, 'Tis thy immortal fame VVe will sing forth with one accord, And glorifie thy Name. O blessed God, thou art all Love, No minute 'scapes thy breast, But brings a favour from above, In that sweet love we rest. Lord, didst thou die, and do we live? Hath not grief slain us yet? Vocuhsafe to us thy grace to give, To live as it is meet. Did thy most precious love to me Make thee to leave thy Throne, And mount the Stage of Infamy? And shalt thou die alone? Lord, let me die, die unto sin, That death, O let me see; Be thou the death of sin, O Lord, VVhich was death unto thee; And as all fulness is in thee, O then we pray pour in, For we are empty thou dost know, Except it be of sin. And since thou hast, O Holy One, A Salve for ev'ry Sore. Let us rejoyce and praise thy Name Now and for evermore. HYMN 153. [Lord, is there joy in Heav'n above] Luke 13. 10. Joy in Heaven when Sinners repent. Lord, is there joy in Heav'n above VVhen Sinners turn to thee? Let this our Souls affections move, To long till it we see. VVhat cause of joy then hath that heart VVho with repenting tears Unfeignedly cleaves unto thee, And to thy ways adheres.! Shall holy Angels, Lord, rejoyce In our sweet happiness, When all the good is unto us, To them not more nor less? In this they act, Lord, like to thee, Who for our only good VVas sacrificed on the Tree, To wash us in thy Blood: And shall not we now learn of thee To seek the good of others? And with one heart strive to impart All comfort to our Brothers? Rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, This duty let us love; And then thy VVill we shall fulfill As Angels do above. But what a low and carnal heart Hath he, whoe're he be, VVho being full, will not impart To those in misery! To pity, and not to relieve, Doth certainly declare Such never did God's Grace receive In truth, nor are sincere. Acknowledg how you have transgress'd Against the Lord your God, And let it be with grief confess'd What By-Paths you have trod; For if we do our sins confess, Faithful and Just is he, From sin and all unrighteousness To cleanse and set us free. HYMN 154. Sung after Sermon. Psal. 31. 19. Great Goodness laid up, and wrought out. Great Goodness thou, O Lord, hast wrought Who can of it conceive? And those thou dost regenerate, 'Tis they do it receive: 'Tis they who are delivered From that forlorn estate They once were in when they lay dead Under thy fearful hate. 'Tis they whose Souls united be Unto thy self, O Lord; And have Communion too with thee, And prize thy blessed Word. They are alive, and love thee dear, Thy Image also they Do in their Souls most clearly bear, And taste of thee each day. They of Christ's Blood and Merits shall For certain have a part; And though they sin, they cannot fall From thee, Lord, in their heart. Their Souls shall live eternally, They sing thy praise therefore; This work being wrought in our Souls, We'll sing for evermore. HYMN 155. A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament. A Feast of Fat things. Lord, thou our bless'd Physician art, Who for our Souls didst die; Thou dost thy precious Blood impart, Our Souls to purifie. When sin and sickness did appear, And nought could do us good, A Med'cine then thou didst prepare, To heal us with thy Blood. Thou art, O Lord, our glorious Sun, Light, Heat and Life's from thee; And thou upon our Souls has shone, By which we quickned be. A Banquet rich thou dost provide, A Table of Fat things; To feast our Souls, O let us eat And drink of thy own Springs. The Feast is thine, of thine own cost, The Lamb is of thy Fold; It is the best in all the Flock, More precious far than Gold. No spot in him was ever found, No blemish, but all pure; Yet for us he had many wounds, Thy wrath he did endure. He drank the bitter of the Cup, That no wrath might remain, That we might drink in draughts of love, And come to life again, And spend our days upon the Earth In joy, through thy sweet Spirit, Until we come thy glory great In Heaven to inherit. HYMN 156. [How great is thy sweet goodness, Lord] Psal. 31. 19. Goodness wrought. How great is thy sweet goodness, Lord, VVhich for us thou hast wrought By Jesus Christ, our dearest Friend, VVho our dear Souls hath bought; That so we might that goodness have, His Life he did lay down, Our Souls from Death and Hell to save, And us with glory crown. And as for us, Christ wrought it out, So in us we do see The Spirit works without all doubt, That we convinc'd might be: And so doth cause us for to feel What unto sin is due, The weight of which would make us reel, And vengeance soon ensue. But 'tis to heal that he doth wound The Soul, and makes it cry; And then with speed he doth make haste A Plaister to apply. None but thy Spirit can convince, And us for Grace prepare; And we, O Lord, may see from hence How helpless once we were. To God the Father, and the Son, And Holy Ghost therefore, Be blessing, honour, and renown, Now and for evermore. HYMN 157.Sung after Sermon. [We of thy Gospel holy, Lord] Rom. 1. 6. The Gospel the power of God. We of thy Gospel holy, Lord, Are not asham'd to own; Because thy glory shines therein, And power is made known. Thy Gospel is the means whereby We, Lord, came to believe, And in it does great Riches lye, VVhich we by Faith receive. Thy Grace in it does glorious shine, And by thy Spirit we Are wrought upon, and so made thine, And union have with thee. VVhat cause have we therefore to sing That we thy Gospel have, And praise our God and heav'nly King VVho strives our Souls to save! Our Enemies the Light do hate, And fain wou'd once again Suppress the Gospel, as of late; O 'tis their bitter pain To see how Light and Truth breaks out, But this is, Lord, our joy; Arise and put them to the rout Who would thy Truth destroy: And we thy Praises will sing forth, And laud thy Name therefore; O let thy Word shine through the Earth Now and for evermore. HYMN 158. The joyful Sound. Who hath or doth, O Lord, believe Th'Report which thou hast given? Many will hear, but few receive Th'joyful News from Heaven. The joyful Sound that's spread abroad There's few which it do mind; For though they have it often heard, Yet not with hearts inclin'd To that which is most truly good They have no mind at all But contrar'wise despise thy Word, And do contemn thy Call: But unto some thou dost make known Thy glorious power divine; And these are they that thou dost own, And callest also thine. They do believe, and also fear; They love and do obey: They cleave to thee, and are sincere, And follow thee alway. And them dost thou with Blessings crown, They sing to thee therefore; And hence it is thou dost them own, And wilt for evermore. HYMN 159. ['Tis thou, O Lord, who dost restore] Psal. 23. 3. The Sinners Soul restored. 'Tis thou, O Lord, who dost restore Our Souls which went astray, And had been lost for evermore Hadst thou not found a way For to recover us again, By sending of thy Son; Under thy wrath we should have lain, And ever been undone. Our sin and sickness was so sore, Nothing could do us good; Nor life unto our Souls restore, But the Physicians Blood. Our case was sad, woful indeed, If it we did but know; Thou therefore sentst thy Son to bleed, Such bowels didst thou show, That he for us, and in our stead Thy dreadful wrath did bear, That of his Flesh our Souls might feed, Lost strength for to repair. Therefore we sing, Lord, unto thee, And well indeed may they Who by thy Grace now quickned be, And set in the right way Unto eternal happiness, Whose Souls thou dost restore; They all praise thee, Lord, more or less, And shall for evermore. HYMN 160. The Godly Man's Soul restored. A Godly Man may greatly fall, But thou, Lord, wilt restore His Soul again, and so he shall Stand faster than before. He under sin long shall not lye Before he doth revive; And whilst he's down his Soul doth cry, And greatly does he strive Against all sin, and it does hate, And fain would he get clear Of every sin and evil thing, To shew he is sincere. But wicked Men do make a trade Of sinning ev'ry day, Their hearts are carnal, and so hard, Sins motions they obey; And in them also it doth reign, And they in it delight; Hence under wrath they do remain, Being odious in thy sight. All praise to God, the Lord above, We find it otherwise, That sin we hate, and thee do love, And thy sweet favour prize. Good Men cannot contented be, Unless restor'd again, And thy most precious face do see, And pardon do obtain. All glory to thy gracious Name We give to thee therefore, And do resolve for to proclaim Thy praise for evermore. HYMN 161. [The Restoration of the Soul] Psal. 23. 3. The glorious restauration of the Soul. [The First Part.] The Restoration of the Soul It is the work alone Of thy own Grace, O God most high, Which to us is made known. Thy wisdom and thy power divine, And mercy infinite, In equal glory, Lord, doth shine Hereby in all Mens sight. If thou hadst not stretch'd out thy hand Our Souls thus to restore, We must have lain in Satan's band, O Lord, for evermore. But are our Souls restor'd indeed, And rais'd to life again? And from eternal death so freed, Shall never feel that pain? And shall also preserved be Unto eternal bliss; Well may such sing continually, What comfort, Lord, like this! What ground of joy and gladness's here? We'll raise thy praise therefore; For all restored Souls shall sing To thee for evermore. The Second Part. The Sinner's misery, and the Saints glory. Sad was the Loss Man did sustain By his most dismal Fall; God's Image marr'd, his Soul-deprav'd, And brought into great thrall; Defil'd, wounded, and naked made, And dead in sin did lie; Thus did his glory at once sade Through his iniquity. Bound in strong Bonds in Satan's Chains His Eyes put out also; He wickedly his God disdains, To him a cursed Foe. For in the mind such enmity Is there in each vile one, That they resist thee day and night, And bid thee to be gone. But yet such Grace didst thou extend To such a filthy Foe, As to send Christ, thy only Son, The Devil to o'rethrow, And Man redeem with stretch'd out Hand, Thy Image to restore; And heal his wounds, and make him see Who was so blind before. Into sweet Union with thy self Thou tak'st him once again; And he in thine own Bosom's laid, Th'Enmity being slain. From sickness he's recovered, From bondage quite set free; He lives again who once was dead, And dearly now loves thee. Well may this cause all Souls to sing Who thus restored be; For unto them, Lord, from hence springs Joy to eternity. HYMN 163. The precious Promises. A happy Soul, O Lord, is he Who Union has with thee; Th'Promises to him are given, Which sweet and precious be. Lord, when thou giv'st thy self to us, Promises are precious; But never till we did believe, Could we e're find them thus. All praise to God, the Lord on high, And to Christ who did die To purchase for us Blessings store To all Eternity. We now therefore, O Lord, will sing Unto our glorious King, From whence the precious Promises Of Grace to us doe spring. What precious Blessings do we see, Who interest have in thee! And shall be happy evermore Unto eternity. HYMN 164. A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament. Halleluja! O happy day That ever Christ was born! And happy we that e're we see This everlasting Morn. Bless'd be the Lamb that hither came To be a Sacrifice; 'Tis by thy Blood we have all good, In thee all Blessings lyes. Our Bands to break thou didst them take, And with them thou wast bound, God's Cords we burst, thou wast acurst To heal our grievous Wound; For us he dy'd, being crucify'd, Sustain'd that cruel death; Wast broke with grief, us'd as a Thief, And gave up his sweet breath. His Grave was made, and Body laid With the rich and unjust; His Honour high despis'd did lye All cover'd up in Dust. Admirable sight, a love most bright, Never the like was seen, That one so high so low should lye, Vile Wretches to redeem. 'Mongst Men, what one wou'd e're have gone His Son thus to abase, For Enemies that him despise, And were in such a case. Prais'd be the Lord, prais'd be the Word And Spirit too therefore; Sing praise will we to the bless'd Three, Now and for evermore. HYMN 165. Man's Impotency. How weak, O Lord, is sinful Man, O how unable's he To act or do, much less to run, Until he's drawn by thee! We, Lord, have no sufficiency, Nor power of our own, To think so much as one good thought, As of our selves alone; But all our whole sufficiency Doth from the Lord proceed, Who works in us most graciously Both the will and the deed. O draw us then our Saviour dear With thy strong Cords of Love, And then will we run after thee As fast as we can move. Shall we by thy own sovereign Grace These special drawings find; Then shall we run our heavenly Race With a sweet raised Mind. HYMN 166. [O Come, ye thirsty Souls, and drink] Isa. 55. 1. Come ye to the Waters. O Come, ye thirsty Souls, and drink; O Come, do not delay! Is it not time, can any think, With speed to come away? O precious Grace and Love divine, Lord, we adore thee do, And praise that holy Name of thine From whence these Waters flow. Waters of Life, how sweet are they To him that thirsteth sore! O he esteemeth them each day, And loves them more and more. They who of them do drink shall live, Yea, and shall never die; And all that come, may them receive, Thou wilt not one deny. They heal the sick and wounded heart And give sight to the blind; There's none shall ever be undone Who do these Waters find. All praise and glory unto God We have these Waters store; Let's drink of them and let us live, And praise thee evermore. HYMN 167. Glorious Light shining forth. Now Christ is preached unto us, His glorious Name made known; The Morning-Star sends forth his light, Dark Shadows now are gone. The Morning of that long'd for Day Will soon break forth amain, When glory great shall fill the Earth, And Jesus Christ shall reign. 'Twill quickly be that we shall sing A new and pleasant Song, And shall exalt poor Sions King, For whose sweet day we long. He thar his Soul pour'd forth to death, And dy'd a Sacrifice, Will like a Lyon quickly rouze, And all his Foes surprize. The gracious Lamb that hither came For Sinners to be slain, Is worthy of all glory great, And therefore shall he reign. The Song of Moses and the Lamb Redeemed Ones shall sing; O let us on his side be found Sincere in ev'ry thing. O happy they who thee have got That suffered on the Tree, And count all things as Dung and Dross When once compar'd to thee. Then shall we find peace in our mind When thus we prize thy Name; And fill'd shall we with glory be, Whilst others fill'd with shame. HYMN 168. The panting Soul. One thing, O Lord, thy Saints desire, And would obtain of thee, Within thy Temple to enquire, Thy beauty there to see; That there may be our dwelling-place, Let us this mercy crave, And all provision of thy Grace There daily also have: That to our joy we all may drink Of living lasting Springs, And also know and the will do Of thee the King of Kings: And being fed with living Bread, May praise thy Name therefore; Refresh'd from thee, from thirsting free, May sing for evermore. HYMN 169. Everlasting Rest. To the Eternal God above Let us loud praise proclaim; Since we have tasted of his Love, Let's glorifie his Name. A blessed rest he hath in store For all who are upright, Where they shall be for evermore In his eternal light. All Tears from off our Eyes shall then Be wiped quite away; And we shall never mourn agen On that eternal day. O then let's fear lest we fall short Of that sweet resting-place; For many seem to bid fair for't, Without one dram of Grace. Let us truly converted be, And Oyl have much in store; For then through thee enter shall we Before thou shut the door: And with joy sing unto our King Eternal Songs above, And filled all both great and small With thy eternal Love. HYMN 170. Hear, and your Souls shall live. Thy Mercy, Lord, is infinite, To call such unto thee, Who loathsom are in thy own fight By their iniquity. O then let Sinners come with speed, B'ing drawn by pow'r divine; Let them unto thy Call give heed, Whilst Gospel-light does shine. Come unto thee, O holy One, And shall our Souls then live! Let Sinners see they are undone, Till Christ does them receive. Lord, take some Sinners by the hand, And save their Souls from Hell; And make them bend to thy Command, O thou canst them compell To come unto the Marriage-Feast; O bring them in to thee, That they may sing thy Praises forth To all eternity. HYMN 171. What shall we do? [The First Part.] O Lord, what shall poor Sinners do Who dead in sin do lie, And must eternal sorrow know, If in that state they die? O praised be thy holy Name Thou hast a way found out To save us from eternal shame, And life to work about. O then shall some this day so hear, That they may Life obtain! Let them to Jesus Christ draw near, And so be born again, Or else they will i'th' Judgment-day Condemned ever be, And on them thou wilt thy wrath pour To all eternity. Then quake and tremble ev'ry one, And not reject God's Call; Lest you at last be all undone, And into Hell do fall. O thou art good to us, O Lord, In sending Christ to die; If Grace thou dost to us afford, We'll sing continually. The Second Part. Who hath made thee differ, &amp;c. O Lord, we praise thy glorious Name For distinguishing Love; Blessed be God Christ hither came To lift us up above. We naturally like others were, Even cursed Foes to thee; But thou hast made thy Grace appear, Whilst others darkness be. Thou hast, O Lord, the difference made, All is of Grace alone; Hence we have cause sweetly to sing To thee the holy One. O shall thy glorious Work appear? Lift up thy Name on high, That Sinners may now ev'ry where To the Lord Jesus fly. And as for us, let it be seen We all converted be, That so we may thy Praises sing To all eternity. HYMN 173. If the Son make you free, &amp;c. Halleluja to thee the Lord above, His Praises let us sing; Exalt his Name continually From whom all Blessings spring. Who didst behold us when we lay Polluted in our sin; And to wash us found out a way To make us clean agen. We Slaves of Sin and Satan were, And in strong Bonds were bound; And when no other help was there, From thee we help have found. Thy Son out of thy Bosom came Our Souls for to set free; All praise unto the Son of God, And equal praise to thee, The Father of our glorious Lord, The God of Grace and Love, Who didst us pity, and afford Salvation from above. No freedom, Lord, for sin is there, But by the Son alone, Who did thy wrath from Sinners bear, Who were all quite undone. Let such who liberty now have, Thy Praises sing therefore; For them wilt thou from bondage save, O Lord, for evermore. HYMN 174. A Hymn after a Farewell Sermon. Shine forth, O Lord, upon our Souls, And let thy Showers fall, That so we may be rooted well, And flourish great and small. We have a sweet reviving time, Who lately seem'd as dead; When shall we be as in the prime? O raise our withered Head! We have had a sore Winters day, A pinching time was here; But shall such Weather fly away, And springing times draw near? We praise thy great and glorious Name For Seasons we have had, O let us not be put to shame, But in thy self be glad. We now must part, and for a while Not see each other here; So let us walk, that when Christ comes, With him we may appear, And sing sweet Songs of Melody, And Joy in God above; And ravish'd be eternally With his transcendant Love. HYMN 175. Christ knocks at the Door. Thou, Lord, knocks at the Sinner's Door, Desiring to come in, To store their hearts with precious Grace, And to destroy their sin. Thy Love is great, and therefore, Lord, Dost wait on them we see, Who will attend unto thy Word, And open unto thee. Lord, thou dost knock and call aloud, Sinners rouze up with speed; If you do open unto him, No good thing shall you need. Thou dost not come with empty hand To those who do believe; For they with thee Communion have, And such like Joys receive; Which prized are by holy Ones Thy Consolations be Not small, O Lord, but very great, Such do receive from thee. All praise, and glory, and renown Therefore to thee they sing; Yea praise let's raise continually Of Christ our glorious King. HYMN 176. The Foot-steps of the Flock. Tell me, O thou beloved One, Where thou thy Flock dost feed? On thee we do depend alone, That thou our Souls mayst lead Into rich Pastures fresh and green, Where we do comfort find, Which doth content our precious Souls, And stay our fainting mind. Thou sendst us to the first Foot-steps Of thy dear Flock of old, There for to feed, and to lye down In thy own blessed Fold; Where rest we may under thy shade With much delight and peace, Where streams of joy most sweetly flow, Which run and never cease. Thou hast o'recome us with thy Love, We can't but must love thee; And being drawn, Lord, from above, We run continually. Therefore we sing unto thy Name, And lift thy praise on high; And for thy sake bear any shame, And will not thee deny. If we do find we do love thee, And thou dost Love return, We'll never cease to raise thy praise Until our lives are done. HYMN 177. [Halleluja to the Lord on high] Act. 8. 5. Christ preach'd. Halleluja to the Lord on high, All glory, honour, praise Ascribe to him continually, And live to him always. Lift Christ on high, our glorious King, In whom all fulness dwells; He is our Life and Fountain-spring, His glory great excells. 'Tis Christ, O God, that we do preach, As thou dost us command; O let thy Word Men's hearts so reach, It may break Satan's Band. O set their Souls at liberty, And them unite to thee, To sing thy praise melodiously Whilst they thy glory see. There's none like Christ in all the Earth, He is that lovely One; His honour we would, Lord, spread forth, And him exalt alone. Thou hast made him the All in all To us in ev'ry thing; Before him shall the mighty fall, And own him to be King. His Day is near, his Foes must down, And never rise again; And flourish must his glorious Crown, And ever shall he reign. HYMN 178. A Hymn of Praise after the Lord's Supper. Wonders of Grace. O let us all with chearful voice Sweet Halleluja's sing; And magnifie the Lord most high, Our glorious God and King, Who wond'rous things for us hast done, Which all our Eyes behold, In saving of his sinking Church, As in the days of old. Let us loud Praise proclaim always, And godly also live Continually both night and day, And glory to him give. Let Christ be had in great esteem, And lifted up on high; O let us all remember him Who for us all did die. How did he, Lord, with bitter cryes Make known his grief to thee, Whilst languishing his Body hung For us upon the Tree. Unto the Cross they did thee nail, Thy Sides they pierc'd also; O let us all apply thy Blood Which from thy Wounds did flow. Its precious vertue we receive, To purge and make us white, That through it we might all indeed Be lovely in thy sight. Lord, didst thou die that we might live? O let us sigh and mourn, With fervent hearts unfeignedly, To think what thou hast born To save our Souls from Wrath and Hell, That we might changed be, And so at last in Heaven dwell To all eternity. HYMN 179. A Hymn of Thanksgiving for our late Deliverance. Thy wondrous Acts of Grace, O Lord, Wrought in all Peoples sight, May stir us up with one accord To praise thee day and night. The cursed snare that Babel laid, Is broken, Lord, by thee; And they of whom we were afraid, Confounded also be. When we like Men near dead did lye, And knew not what to do; Thou didst defeat our Enemy, And them quite overthrow. Thou hast also, Lord, heard our Cry For bleeding Ireland; And sav'd the King, when death was nigh, With thy blessed Right-hand. And Liberty to us is given To Worship without fear; And with sweet Dews and Showers from Heav'n Our Souls thou now dost chear. We therefore glorifie thy Name To whom all praise belongs, And celebrate thy glorious Fame With joy in holy Songs. HYMN 180. The power of Prayer. Prayer is a Duty ev'ry one Should use both day and night; Prayer is a Duty God does love, And in it takes delight. Prayer is a Duty prevalent, It has Jehova's Ear; Prayer should to Heaven be daily sent When we are in great fear. VVhate're we want, if we do pray To thee most fervently, And ask according to thy VVill, VVe shall have all supply. To Prayer of wicked Men, O Lord, Thou wilt no Answer give; But wilt hear those who are sincere, And do uprightly live. All praise to God, the Lord most high, VVho hast said, Seek my face; VVhate're thou dost our Souls deny, Give us more of thy Grace. HYMN 181. Saints Safety. To God most high we lift our voice, And sing with one accord; For we safe always are in thee, Our help is in the Lord. Some trust in Men, and in their Wealth, And Riches do embrace, But, Lord, grant us thy saving health, And shinings of thy face. Thou hast put gladness in our heart By those thy Beams divine, Much more than they who have their part Of Corn, of Oyl and Wine. On thy own strength we do repose, And thereby are secure And safe from all most dreadful woes, Our dwelling-place is sure, Within the Clifts of the bless'd Rock From whence sweet Waters flow, And therefore will not fear that shock That Babel will o'rethrow. Thou hast sav'd us from wrath to come At the most dismal day, And wilt save us from bloody Rome, Who would us all betray. To him that on the Throne sits down, And Christ the Lamb therefore, Be blessing, glory and renown Now and for evermore. HYMN 182. [All praise to God the glorious One] All praise to God the glorious One, Thy Name let us adore, Who loved us, and sent his Son, Praise him for evermore. The Cherubims with one accord Do sing continually; O holy, holy, holy Lord, And glorious Majesty: And shall not we affected be With thy redeeming Love, And sing to thee melodiously With hearts raised above All earthly things, since we have Springs To drink of in the way, That are so sweet, and make us meet For Christ another day. Our Tables spread with heavenly Bread In presence of our Foes; We eat fat things, and drink of Springs From whence Soul-comfort flows. What, Lord, so good as Divine Food To those that gracious be, And know full well nought can excell What they enjoy of thee? To God the Father, and the Son, And Holy Ghost therefore, Be glory, honour, and renown, Now and for evermore. HYMN 183. [O happy Souls who look to thee] Zach. 12. 10. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced. O happy Souls who look to thee, And presently do mourn And grieve for their iniquity, Seeing what thou hast born. O Lord, how did our horrid sin Upon thee heavy lye! VVe pierced thee once and agen By our iniquity. O let us look until we love, And thee with joy embrace; Men will loath Sin and it forsake VVhen they receive thy Grace. And since there is for us relief In thee, O Saviour dear, Let's throw away all Unbelief, And joyful all appear. Into thy presence we are come, Let's make a joyful noise, And sing to thee who 'tis alone That all our Foes destroys. No Enemy without, within, But from them thou canst save; Therefore let's sing thy glorious praise, And unto thee let's cleave. Sin never shall that Soul destroy That looketh unto thee, Such sing, and shall with inward joy Unto Eternity. HYMN 184. When recovered after a Fit of Sickness, Sept. 16. 1688 Let that life-breathing Face of thine, Lord, manifested be; Because thy Love excelleth VVine, All upright Ones love thee. Thou hast, O Lord, redeemed us, Yea, from the lowest Hell, And rais'd us to an higher state Than that from whence we fell. VVith Flaggons of refreshing Joy, And Comforts from above, Stay us, O Lord, we humbly pray, Let us be sick of Love. For these great Blessings, O most High, VVe will thy Praises sing, VVho hast also, Lord, heard our cry, Praise to our glorious King. VVe cried to thee with our hearts To make thy Servant whole, And from the all-devouring Grave For to return his Soul. And thou dost, Lord, a new life send, And wouldest not permit That he should hastily descend Into the dolesom Pit. VVe therefore sing and give thee praise, Most holy let us be, VVith hearts united all our days Let us live unto thee. HYMN 185. [Lord, we do see that poor we be] Rev. 3. 18. Buy of me Gold tried in the Fire. Lord, we do see that poor we be, But thou hast Riches store; And if that we do come to thee, VVe nothing shall want more. VVhat is our own to us is shown Is good, alas, for nought; O let it go, since we do know Rare things are to be bought: And thou dost cry, O come and buy! O blessed be the Lord! Now is the day, let's not delay, But close in with thy Word: Then rich shall we for ever be, And Crowns of Glory have; And Robes so white that shine like Light Shall we likewise receive. Grace is like Gold, but doth excell VVhatever is on Earth; O happy they who know full well Its great and glorious worth. Shall they not sing who see the Spring Of Grace doth Blessings pour; Thy holy praise we will always, Lord, sing for evermore. HYMN 186. [Ye Saints, break forth with chearful voice] Zach. 12. 10. They shall look to me. After Sermon. Ye Saints, break forth with chearful voice, And sing Christ's glorious praise; His Love is sweet, O it is choice! Ye Saints praise him always. Come, look and love! O cast your Eye Upon this lovely One! He is your help, your Food, your Strength, Your Hope, your Joy and Crown. Christ is the Root, Christ is the Branch, Christ is our Testator; Christ is the holy Lamb of God, Christ is our Mediator. Christ is the VVay, Christ is the Door, Christ is our Physician; Christ is our Meat, Christ is our Drink, He's thus to ev'ry Christian. Christ is God's great Embassador, Christ is the only Heir; Christ is the Bright and Morning-Star, Christ is beyond compare. Christ is the Foundation sure, Christ is the corner-stone; Christ is the VVitness and the Truth, Christ is the only one. Sing praise to Christ, exalt him then, And look to him always; O sing to him, and never cease Till you do end your days. HYMN 187. The heavenly Feast. O praise the Lord, and look to him, Sing praise unto his Name; O all ye Saints of Heav'n and Earth Set forth his glorious fame: VVho spared not his only Son, But gave him for us all; And made him drink the Cup of VVrath, The VVormwood and the Gall. He dy'd indeed, but rose again, And did ascend on high, That we poor Sinners lost and dead Might live eternally. His Flesh is heavenly Food indeed, His Blood is Drink divine, His Graces drops, like Honey-falls, His Comforts taste like VVine. Lord Christ, thou hast refresh'd our Souls VVith thy abounding Grace; For which we magnifie thy Name, Longing to see thy Face. Let the Redeemed of the Lord Their thankful voices raise; Can we be dumb whilst Angels sing Our great Redeemer's praise. Come let us joyn with Angels then, Glory to God on high; Peace upon Earth, Good-will to Men, Thus sing eternally. HYMN 188. The Harvest is the end of the World. Harvest of Joy. The Harvest-day will soon be here, A blessed day 'twill be To all those Souls who are sincere, For Jesus they shall see. Thou send'st thy glorious Rays on us, And Dews, our Souls to chear; But e're long we with open Eyes The Vision shall have clear. Most sweet reviving Acts of Grace Are those we feel of thine, Whilst we behold thy glorious Face, Yet stronger Beams will shine, To comfort and rejoyce each heart To all eternity; From thee, O Lord, we ne're shall start, But in thy Garner lye; Or rather in thy precious Arms We being ripened, Shall housed be with lasting Charms Of Glory on our Head. No sorrow shall us then annoy, Nor fears cause inward pain; Nor sin nor Satan spoyl our joy, Nor filth our glory stain, We shall not then, as now, be vext With Satan, World, and Sin; Nor with base Hearts be more perplext When Heaven has took us in. HYMN 189. The woful Harvest of the Wicked. This World will quickly have an end, That is the Harvest-day; And Jesus will the Reapers fend, They come and shall not stay. The Angels they the Reapers be, The Wheat are God's Elect, Which shall, Lord, gathered be to thee, The Tares thou wilt reject: The Tares are those vile wicked Men Who do thy Saints annoy, Which shall in Bundles bound be then, That thou may'st them destroy; And into Flames thou wilt them cast, Their Worm shall never die; The Fire too shall ever last Ev'n to Eternity. The false Professor will be found Amongst the cursed Foe; And with prophane Ones shall be bound, And equal sorrow know. But a bless'd day will be to those Whose Hearts are found upright, VVho did in truth with Jesus close, And serv'd him day and night. They shall with thee in glory be, Lord Christ when thou dost come; But Unbelievers shall from thee Receive their final doom. HYMN 190. Christ's Passion and Exaltation. Hosanna to King David's Son, The Lord's anointed One, VVho quickly shall exalted be Upon his glorious Throne. Triumph and shout, O Heavens high! And let the Earth rejoyce! And let the Saints melodiously Lift up in Songs their voice To Christ the King, because that he A Feast provideth here; And tells us we all welcome be To eat of his good Chear. His Flesh for us doth freely give, His Blood to drink also, That we might never die but live, These Blessings from him flow. His bleeding VVounds, out-stretched Arms, And yearning Bowels dear, To us run out for sweet support, That so we might not fear. Thou art the first, yea and the last, VVas dead, and art alive; And lives for ay, therefore to thee All honour we must give. HYMN 191. [O Virgins know, both Fools and VVise] The Second Part. Awake ye Virgins. O Virgins know, both Fools and VVise, The Bridegroom is at hand; He comes, he comes, let it suffice, But who with him shall stand? He that his Lamp doth fitly trim, And Oyl doth get good store, Shall then embraced be by him, And reign for evermore. Cast off your drowze, let's all awake, 'Tis not a time to slumber; But speedily our Lamps lets take, And haste to th'VVedding-Chamber; For certainly our dearest Lord VVill quickly come away; The mid-night Cry will soon be heard, His Chariots will not stay. O take thy flight on VVings of Love, And like the nimble Hart, Come, Lord, O come down from above! Let's meet and never part. The Bride saith, Come, O do not stay! And he that hears thy voice, In hopes that thou wilt come away, Most sweetly does rejoyce. HYMN 192. Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation. The Third Part. The Spirit saith, Dear Jesus come; The thirsty Soul doth cry Daily to thee; this is the summ, O come most speedily. Signs of thy Day upon us be, The World it is perplex'd; The Nations groan and long for thee, By Wars being sorely vex'd. Thy Saints do mourn their Sighs and Tears Invite thee for to come, The Martyrs Blood cryes in thy Ears For Babels final doom. Thou sayst, Surely I come quickly, Amen, Amen, O Lord; O come! O come! my Soul doth cry, According to thy Word. Lord, thou didst come, thou cam'st to die, And bear most bitter pain, God's Justice for to satisfie, And Pardon to obtain. Thou didst come to be humbled, And suffer on the Tree, Therefore shalt thou lift up thy Head, And high exalted be. Thy Right it is to reign as King, Thou art the only Heir; The Kingdom's, thine thy Foes down bring, Thy vengeance let them bear. HYMN 193. Signs of the last Day upon us. The Fourth Part. The Fig-Tree, Lord, does now put forth, The Summer doth draw near, The Sea doth roar, (as thy VVord saith,) And Men begin to fear. The VVinter certainly is gone, The lovely Birds do sing; The Spring is now a coming on, VVhich lasting joy will bring. The voice of the sweet Turtle too Is heard in this our Land, VVhat clearer Signs, Lord, canst thou show By thy own wondrous Hand, Of thy approach and glor'ous reign The Nations angry be; Thy wrath is come, their glory slain, Thy Kingdom let us see. The Ev'ning of a former day Portends a dismal night, But holy one; our Souls may say, Our Ev'ning has some light. Not light nor dark, this is the hour, It's neither night nor day; 'Tis, 'tis the time of thy dread power, O haste and come away. The whole Creation sadly groans, And utters its last cryes; Poor Sion vents her piteous moans, VVhilst Tears fill each Saints Eyes. O come, bless'd One, make no delay, The VVicked do thee dare; Come holy Jesus, come away! Thine Arrows do not spare. Shall Heaven give the long'd for Call, That Earth beneath may quake, That Romes high Towers down may fall Now the dead Bones do shake. HYMN 194. The Day of Jubilee The Fifth Part. O Blessed Day, how sweet is it To think upon that time VVhen Christ shall upon his Throne sit, And Summer's in its prime. VVhen all the Earth together shall Break forth and sweetly sing; And all Christ's Foes with vengeance fall, VVho own not him for King. VVhen Saints who now divided are, Shall all united be; And in their glitt'ring Robes appear, And sing in harmony VVhen Swords and also warlike Spears Men shall to Plow-shares beat; And all Men quite be freed from fears, And from all scorching heat: And under their own Vines sit down VVith hearts full of sweet joy; O come, Lord Jesus, take the Crown, O haste and come away. Wars then we find shall ever cease, Envy 'mongst Men depart; Nothing but Love and blessed Peace In each Believer's heart. The Lyon and the Lamb shall then Together feed and ly; And the like concord amongst Men Shall then be certainly. HYMN 195. A Hymn of Praise. O let us sing with chearful hearts Sweet Hymns of Soul-delight! With one accord before the Lord, That's pleasing in his sight. What People have more cause to praise The living God on high, Than have all those whom thou hast chose, And for whom Christ did die! With full assurance let's draw near, That we accepted be; And then our peace will much encrease, Which, Lord, we have in thee. O what a kind of Love is this The Father grants to us, To be the Sons of God above, And him to call us thus! We know not now what we shall see, Yet this thou dost declare, That like to thee we all shall be, When thou dost next appear. True Faith let's have on Christ to rest, And Hope, which cannot fail; That does take hold, Lord Christ, of thee Who art within the vail. And then, O Lord, if Storms arise, And Seas afresh should roar, We shall in thee secured be Now and for evermore. HYMN 196. The bleeding and wounded Heart. O Lord, how sad's the case of Man, By reason of the Fall! His heart is hard, that nothing can, Alas, pierce it at all, Until the time doth come when he God's power within does know; O then he doth, Lord, seek to thee, Not knowing what to do. O happy Souls, who pierc'd have been, And broken thoroughly, In the true sight and sense of sin, And do on Christ rely. Such who are broken, thou wilt heal, Who the Physician art, Thou wilt not cast off any such Who have a contrite heart. Let Sinners, Lord, die unto sin, Wound them, O Lord, we pray! And let them find Soul-life within, And comfort ev'ry day. O bless thy Word, and let it be Salvation to the Poor; And we thy Praises, Lord, will sing Now and for evermore. HYMN 197. Things done for us. Some things for us, Lord, must be done By thy Almighty Hand; It must be Jesus Christ alone Who in our stead did stand; Who bore thy heavy wrath, O Lord, For us upon the Tree; And paid the Debts which Sinners owe To thy dread Majesty. All praise and glory let us sing To God the Lord most high, Who did to us Salvation bring From Hell and Misery. The Just for the Unjust did bear The punishment of sin, That we of righteousness might share, Who so defil'd have been. Shall Life now in our Souls be wrought, And Grace implanted be, That home to Christ we may be brought, And Union have with thee? Then will we sing sweet Songs of Praise, And lift thy Name on high; And happy be, Lord, all our days, More happy when we die. HYMN 198. Things done in us. O Lord what hast thou done for us? And in us also wrought; On the Lord Jesus we depend, By whom our Souls were bought. All praise and glory unto God Who hath made us alive, And to exalt thee let us see We all of us do strive! And to excell in doing all That thou dost us command; And readily obey thy Call, That we may one day stand With boldness, and the greatest joy, Before thy glorious Throne, When many Persons bitterly Shall cry with woful moan. Our works are all wrought in us, Lord, And for us too by thee; Thy Praises therefore we will sing, And that continually. HYMN 199. Grace shining. Let such who have enlightned been Behold thy glorious Grace And Power divine, prepar'd to shine Before all Peoples face. By thy Grace, Lord, O let us move, And with a holy Song Exalt thee who dost dwell above, To whom all praise belongs. It's none but thee who can appease The wrath that burns within, And to a wounded heart give ease, That's burdened with sin. We thee adore, and worship do, And at thy precious Feet Contentedly we all would lye To tast thy mercy sweet. And thou, dear Saviour, who for sin The Curse didst undergo, Unless thy Arm reveal'd had been, No help to us could flow. All praise to God, and to the Lamb And Spirit be therefore; Teach us to know what we must do, And sing for evermore. HYMN 200. Bread indeed. How good, O Lord, is thy blest Word To all that are sincere! Because it doth such good afford, Thy Children love it dear. O let us taste of thy sweet Love, And in thy self delight; And feed us also from above Every day and night. That with the fat things of thy House We all may feasted be; And flourish in thy glorious Courts, Dear God, continually. Many do seem to be content, Whilst they on Husks do feed; But let our Souls to Christ be bent, And stor'd with all we need. One hour in thy blest Courts let's prize Above all times and days; And also sing and laud thy Name, And live unto thy praise. HYMN 201. A Feast of Fat things. Lord, thou art great, and also good; Thy Love and Grace is such, Thou giv'st poor hungry Souls sweet Food, And nothing think'st too much; For them who unto Christ do come, All things prepared be; No sooner do they once come home, But welcome are to thee. The fatted Calf, and Bread indeed, And precious Wine good store; And all things else which Sinners need, Are ready for the Poor: Where feed and feast all on free cost May such who hungry be; All is of Grace, that none may boast, But only, Lord, in thee. O then let's eat and drink the best, And praise the Lord above; And lean upon his dearest Breast Till ravished with Love. HYMN 202. Unless ye believe that I am he, &amp;c. How dark is he, how blind, Who hath a carnal mind? He hath no peace if he so die, He none shall ever find. He that in Christ doth not believe, Nor in Truth now receive The offers of his special Grace, May not his Loss retrieve. Die in your Sins, Tremble and Fear, What Man is it can hear Those words, and find his heart not now Rent and to pieces tare? Let's lift thy Name, O Lord, on high, And make sweet melody; And so believe and live, that we In sin may never die. HYMN 203. The glorious Gift. All praise and glory now be given To God, the Lord above, Who gives to us the best of Heaven, Himself, His Grace, and Love. Most precious are his promises, They firm and sure be; Thou all our wants wilt, Lord, supply, And that continually. Though we are poor in earthly things, And little do possess; Yet richer are than wicked Kings, And never shall have less. He that hath God, possesseth all, And what would he have more? Shall not that Man contented be? Can any think he's poor? O let us then lift up our voice, And sing melodiously; And in the Lord always rejoyce Until we come to die. HYMN 204. Christ became poor. O holy and most glorious King, The mighty Prince of Peace, Thou art that Lamb by whom we came From sin to have release. Thou in the glorious Form of God, Before all Worlds indeed, Most splendently O thou didst shine, And nothing didst thou need: And yet thy love to us was such, Thou for us becam'st poor, That we through thy great Poverty Might all have Riches store. We never can to thee express Our Thanks sufficiently, Who in our stead, and for our sakes A shameful death didst die. The Wrath and Curse that was our due, O Lord, thou didst endure; And in the Grave, O thou didst lye, Our freedom to procure. O depths and heighths of divine Love! None can compare with thee, So low to lye, that we on high At last might raised be. Lord, thou art all in all to us, To God all praise therefore; To him, to thee, and Spirit, we Will sing for evermore. HYMN 205. A Hymn of Dr. P. taken out of his [Century of select Psalms, p. 201.] (From several Passages of the Revelations.) All ye that serve the Lord, his Name See that ye celebrate; And ye that fear him, sing aloud His praise, both small and great. O thou great Ruler of the World, Thy Works our wonder raise: Thou blessed King of Saints, how true And righteous are thy ways! Who would not fear and praise thy Name, Thou only Holy One? The World shall worship thee, to whom Thy Judgments are made known. Most Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Almighty is thy Name; Which was before all time, and is, And shall be still the same. All Glory, Pow'r, and Honour, thou Art worthy to receive; For all things by thy Pow'r were made, And by thy Pleasure live. To thee of right, O Lamb of God, Riches and Pow'r belong; Wisdom and Honour, Glory, Strength, And every praising Song. Thou as our Sacrifice wast slain, And by thy precious Blood, From ev'ry Tongue and Nation hast Redeem'd us unto God. Blessing and Honour, Glory, Power, By all in Earth and Heaven, To him that sits upon the Throne, And to the Lamb, be giv'n.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IX. Containing part of some Select PSALMS of DAVID. HYMN 206. [The Man is bless'd that shuns the Snare] Psal. 1. The Blessed Man. The Man is bless'd that shuns the Snare Of wicked Mens advice, Whom Sinners Paths, or Scorners Chair By no means can entice: But his delight both day and night Is in God's holy Law, Wherein he waits and meditates With constant care and awe. Like planted Tree by Water-Springs Shall such a Man be made, A Tree that timely Fruit brings forth, Whose Leaf shall never fade: And God shall bless with good success All actions of the Just; Unlike them far the wicked are, And as the driven Dust: Therefore th'Ungodly never may In Judgment stand acquitted; Nor with the Just in that great Day Shall Sinners be admitted; For Men upright are Gods delight, Their way to him is known; But Sinners way shall soon decay, And quite be overthrown. HYMN 207. [Why do the Heathen Gentiles rage] Psal. 2. Christ's Kingdom. Why do the Heathen Gentiles rage, And foolish things surmize? Kings set themselves against the Lord, And do his Christ despise. His gracious Government they count Their Yoke, his Laws their Chain; Freedom they'll have without controll, No Bands shall them restrain; But God above will scorn their rage, Their vain attempts deride; He will affright them in his wrath, Vex and defeat their pride. For all their spite I've set my King Upon his holy Throne; And what I had decreed before, Proclaim'd him now my Son. This is the Birth-day of his Rule, Thy Scepter I'll advance Or'e all the Earth, the Gentiles give For thine Inheritance. Thou with an Iron Rod shalt bruise Their disobedient Neck; Like brittle Potsherds all their Pow'rs Without resistance break. Let the great Rulers of the Earth This greater Lord obey; Serve him with chearful willingness, And fear him too each day. In low submission to the Son Your happiness does lye; Then ye are safe when he's well-pleas'd; When he's provok'd, ye die. HYMN 208. [Fond Men, that would my glory stain] Psal. 4. The Saints Security in God. Fond Men, that would my glory stain, My Government despise; How long will ye pursue vain hopes, And please your selves with lyes? Know that the Lord does righteous Men With special favour own; Though ye despise me, he ne're will On my Petitions frown. Sin not, but fear; let quiet Thoughts Instruct and make you wise; Joyn a pure Heart with Trust in God, As the best Sacrifice. Though others in distrust of thee To other succours fly, Thou art our Hope, Lord, cast on us A favourable Eye. Thy Love more chears my heart than when Their Corn has wish'd encrease; Or when a happy, Vintage makes Their Wine o'reflow the Press. Down will I lye in peace, and sleep Shall close my wearied Eyes; No fear disturb me whilst I know In God my Safety lyes. HYMN 209. [God is a righteous Judge be sure] Psal. 7. Wrath against Persecutors. God is a righteous Judge be sure, And one that will repay; And with the lewd and wicked Doer God's angry ev'ry day: Unless he do his sins forego, And speedily repent, He'll whet his Sword, and string his Bow, He hath it ready bent. His deadly Darts he doth ordain To smite him unawares; And for the Persecutors pain Sharp Arrows he prepares. He made a Pit, in digging which No pains at all he spar'd; And fell he is into the Ditch Which he himself prepar'd. Upon his own unhappy Crown His mischief shall be spread; His violent dealings shall come down, And light on his own head. But I his Justice will proclaim, Who judgeth righteously; And with a Song will praise the Name Of God until I die. HYMN 210. [God in his Sanctuary dwells] Psal. 11. The Misery of the Wicked. God in his Sanctuary dwells, Heav'ns glorious Throne, From whence he views the Sons of Men, And judges ev'ry one. When he examins righteous Ones, He does their works approve; Such as are wicked and unjust, His Soul can never love. Snares shall befall them, and for these This mixture is made up, Fire, Brimstone, and tempestuous Storms The Portion of their Cup. God who himself is righteous, does In righteousness delight, And still will favour and protect The Man that is upright. HYMN 211. [Lord, let me know that happy Man] Psal. 15. The spotless Saint. Lord, let me know that happy Man Whom thou so well dost love, That he may praise thee here below, And dwell with thee above. 'Tis he whose Life is free from blame, Whose works are right and just; Whose hearts and words are true, and whom One may securely trust. His Neighbours Credit does not wound By a detracting Tongue; Nor in his Infamy delight, Much less would do him wrong. Who does not break his Oath when he To his own damage swears; But his strict Vertue far before His Interest preferrs. Who hates Exaction, and rejects Bribes to betray the Just; This Man shall ne're be mov'd, but may In God securely trust. HYMN 212. [My Shepherd is the living Lord] Psal. 23. Pastures green and flourishing. My Shepherd is the living Lord, 'Tis he that doth me feed; How can I but be richly stor'd, Whilst he supplies my need. In Pastures green and flourishing He makes me to repose, Hard by the silent Water-Spring, Whose Streams with pleasure flows. He guides my Soul, so apt to stray, A safer course to take; Conducting me in his right way, For his alone Name's sake: And tho' I walk in Death's dark shade It shall me not dismay; For thou art with me, and hast made Thy Rod and Staff my stay. My Table spread thou didst appoint In presence of my Foe; My Head with Oyl thou dost annoint, My Cup doth overflow. Thy Grace and Goodness certainly Shall measure all my days; And in thy House, O God, will I For ever give thee praise. HYMN 213. [Thou wilt arise in Mercy yet] Psal. 102. Sion repair'd. Thou wilt arise in Mercy yet, And Grace to Sion send, Because the time for favour set Is now come to an end; For even in the Stones thereof Thy Servants take delight, Her very Dust is cause enough Of favour in thy sight. And then the Heathen far and near Shall dread thy glorious Name; And all the Kings on Earth shall fear Thy Glory and thy Fame. When as the Lord shall once repair Poor Sions broken Wall, His Glory then shall shine so fair, It shall appear to all. He will regard the destitute, And not despise their Prayer; He will regard their humble Suit With tender love and care. O let the God of Israel then Be prais'd with one accord; Henceforth for evermore, Amen, All Men praise ye the Lord. HYMN 214. [Mark and behold the perfect Man] Psal. 36. 37. The perfect Man. [The First Part.] Mark and behold the perfect Man, For that Man's end is peace; But quickly shall Transgressors all Be quite cut off and cease. But the Salvation of the Just Is of the Lord most high; Their strength and stay i'th' evil day Of their adversity. And he shall shield and save the Just, And keep them Life and Limb; Deliv'ring them from wicked Men, Because they trust in him. Psalm 4. The greater sort crave worldly Wealth, And Riches they embrace; But, Lord, grant us thy Saving-health, And shining of thy Face. O praise the Lord, Jerusalem, Thy God, O Sion, praise; For lo thy Gates and Bars of them He very strongly stays. Thy Children in thee he hath bless'd, Thy peace he makes full great; And fills thee with the very best And finest of the Wheat. Let Israels God the Lord therefore Be praised altogether; From first to last, for evermore, Amen, Amen for ever. HYMN 215. [The Lord is just in all his ways] Psal. 135. Prayer readily answered. The Lord is just in all his ways, Holy in all he doth; And nigh to ev'ry one that prays, And calls on him in truth. He will fulfill the just desires Of all the holy Seed; He hears their cry, what that requires, And helps them at their need. The Lord preserveth faithfully All those that do him love, But all the wicked he'll destroy With vengeance from above: Therefore my mouth shall speak his praise, And universal flesh His holy Name renown shall raise, And ever sound afresh. HYMN 216. [Come, let us with united joys] Psal. 95. Spiritual Worshippers. Come, let us with united joys To God our voices raise; With thankful hearts before him come And loudly sing his praise. Our Lord is a great God and King, In Pow'r eminent Above all Gods, him Angels serve, And Princes represent. To him that made us let us kneel, And Adoration give, Who are his People, and the Sheep That on his Pasture live. To day let's hear his voice, and not Such hardned Sinners prove, As those that in the Wilderness Provoked God above. They prov'd his Pow'r, and saw his Works, And griev'd him forty year, Till wearied with the murm'ring Race, He could no longer bear. He did their Unbelief, and base Ingratitude detest; And in his anger swore they should Not come into his rest. HYMN 217. [How amiable are thy bless'd Tents] Psal. 84. Sacred Pantings. How amiable are thy bless'd Tents, Lord God of Hosts, to me; My Soul doth long, ye?a? even faint, Thy sacred Courts to see. My heart and flesh cry out for thee The Everlasting God, O when shall I come near and see The place of thine abode? O happy they who hold a Place Within thy House to dwell; For in thy Courts one days short space A thousand doth excell. Much rather would I keep a Door, And in thy House remain, Than dwell in all the pomp and store Of Tents of the prophane; For God a Sun and Shield will be, With Grace and Glory bright; And no good thing with-hold will he From them that walk upright. Lord God of Hosts, whose Glory reigns, How happy Man is he, That tho' debarr'd the outward means, Yet puts his trust in thee. HYMN 218. [Make joyful noise unto the Lord] Psal. 100. Sheep of God's Pasture. Make joyful noise unto the Lord, O all ye Nations on the Earth, Serve him with joy, his praise record, Come in his sight with Songs of Mirth. Know that the Lord is God alone, We are the Flock which he doth keep; His workmanship, and not our own, His People and his Pasture-Sheep. Enter his Gates with thankfulness, And come with joy into his Courts; Great gratitude to him express, And bless his Name in full resorts; For lo, the Lord is good and kind, His Mercy everlasting is; His Truth all Generations find For evermore assur'd to his. HYMN 219. [Give laud unto the Lord] Psal. 135. A Psalm of Praise. Give laud unto the Lord, And praise his holy Name; His Praises still record, And spread abroad his Fame, Ye that resort To our great God, and have abode In Sions Court. His Honour, O proclaim, For good and kind he is; Sing Praises to his Name, A pleasant work it is: Jacob hath he Chose to himself, and all his Wealth Must Israel be. And this I clearly know The Lord's a mighty One, And that all Gods do owe Subjection to his Throne; For he brings forth Whatever he please, in Deeps, in Seas, In Heaven and Earth. HYMN 220. [Return, O Lord, how long a space!] Psal. 90. Longings for good Times. Return, O Lord, how long a space! Let it repent thee much, Touching thy Servants woful case, Whose sufferings have been such. O satisfie us speedily With thy Compassions kind, That all our days may yield us joy, And gladness chear our mind. As thou hast sent us Sorrows keen, So let's have Comforts glad, For days and years which we have seen So sorrowful and sad. O let thy Work appear unto Thy Servants ev'ry one; Thy glory to our Children show, When we are dead and gone. The Lord our God shine on his Church, And Grace our joynt endeavour; O prosper thou our handy-work, And 'stablish it for ever. HYMN 221. [My Soul now bless with readiness] Psal. 103. Free Pardon. My Soul now bless with readiness The Lord's most holy Name, And let my heart's most inward parts Applaud and spread his fame. O bless the Lord, his praise record, My Soul be not unkind, As one that slights his Benefits, And puts them out of mind: Who pardons thy Iniquity, And cancels all thy score; Who healeth thy Infirmity, And doth thy health restore: Who from the Grave thy Life did save, And Crowns thee from above; With Mercies free inlarg'd to thee By his most tender love: Who satisfies thy Mouth likewise With Blessings that are good; Thy flower of Youth, as th'Eagles, doth He make afresh to bud. HYMN 222. [O praise Jehovah ev'ry one] Psal. 148. All Creatures to praise God. O praise Jehovah ev'ry one, From Heav'n praise him in places high! O all his Angels praise him ye, Praise him his Host most gloriously! Ye Sun and Moon do ye him praise, All Stars of Light praise him do ye! O Heav'n of Heav'ns do ye the like, And Waters that 'bove Heavens be! O let them praise Jehovah's Name! By him created were all they; For ever he establish'd them, Gave Statutes which pass not away. O praise Jehovah from the Land, Ye Dragons, and all places deep; Ye Fire and Hail, Snow, Vapour, and Windy Storms that his Word keep. Ye Mountains and ye Hills also, Ye Trees fruitful and Cedars high; And ye wild Beasts and Cattel all, Ye creeping things, and Fowls that fly. Ye Kings who rule the People do, Princes and Judges likewise; all Young Men and Maidens do the same, With Old Men and ye Children small. O let them praise Jehovah's Name! Who hath a Name like unto his, 'Tis high advanc'd; his glorious Fame Above the Earth and Heaven is. And he the Horn of his People Exalted hath, and set on high; O praise the Lord, sweet Israel, A People unto him so nigh. FINIS.</field>
