      <field name="fulltext">A SINFVLL Mans Solace.Prose speeches in this poem have been omitted and are marked by [...]. Contriued into seuen daies Conference betweene Christ and a wordly-minded Rich-man. [The Monday, or first daies conference] The Argvment. A certaine coueitous Rich man, hauing his Cofers full of gold and siluer: And so great aboundance of all thinges about him, that he thought himselfe so farre in fortunes fauour, that (being blinded with his greedy desires of gaine, and loue of himselfe) he fell into this foolish conceit following. The Rich-man. Oh Corps of mine, take now thine ease, The foolish conceites of most men, that this world doeth fauour (as it were) at will, is commonly thus. betake thy lymbs to rest: I haue enough to keepe thee now, as dainty as the best. My wily wit hath woon such wealth now is my store house full: I will the same enlarge in hast, and downe my barnes Ile pull. And build them bigger for my grain, whose great encrease is such: That all my house ne Garners can, contain in them so much, My Staules likewise I, must augment, wherein I may conueie, Mine Oxen and my Cattle store, my fodder and mine Hay, I must prouide me greater Chests, and Locks in stronger wise, Where to conuey my bagges of gold, with strong and curious Keyes. And Seruants both of men &amp; maids I must likewise prouide: To waite on me and on my wife, where so we goe or ride. My Plough &amp; other husband works, for want of Seruants more, Are idle and lie quite vndone, but I will get me store. My flocks of sheep doe so abound, my sheepheards are so few, By vew, the number of their charge they cannot rightly shew. Whereby my profite goes to wrack, I will prouide in hast, To keep my substance from annoy, and from such spoyling waste. And when these things prouided be, I then will take mine ease: And carke for nothing else at all, Worldlie wealth, and bodily health are the principall thinges now a daies regarded. but how to shun disease. And to maintain mine health so long, that I may see my store, To be as great as Cresus wealth, ye, (if I can) and more, Yet first I will erect in hast, A great care of the wealthy, is to haue a gaye house, deckt both within and without, after the daintiest fashion. a sumptuous Pallace hie; Wherin like Prince in passing pomp, my friends and I may lie: With each delight &amp; pleasant sport, to please my dainty mind, Set forth with caruings &amp; conceits, as curious head can finde. With goodly Gallaries aloft, of prospect far and neere: With Garden walks, and pleasant springs: &amp; princely parks of deere. Sweet Arbors here and there, about my Pallace shalbe set, With plants of price, of sweetest smel, that I for coyne can get. Wherein, to passe my pleasaunt daies, I will my solace take: With melodie and musicke sweet, and all things else forsake. But loe, where should I finde a seat, Care is had to the situation of a worldlie building, and none at all for the place where the soule must dwell at last.thus to content my minde? It must be where some plesaunt spring and woods do grow by kind. Where eccoes with resounding voice, may answere Cornet shrill: The Trumpet and Recorder sweet, to please my fancy still. Which might it be, where Wheary boat could passe the Theams with oare, Where I might take my like repaste, with Citron and Bandoare. It were a wished seate indeede, a pleasant place for mee: To take my solace at my will, and passe my time with glee. And as I gesse I haue a place, within a Manour neare, A farme in lease, Ile get me that, and place my Palace there. I thinke my Tenant wilbe glad, Might without regard to right, thinkes the poorer will yeeld for feare. And the Landlords think the Tenant bound to yeeld to all his tyrranie to yelde to my request: If not, he shall be sure to sit, therein with litle rest. Goe footboye, goe thy way in haste, to Simple of the Grange, And bid him come to me as fast, as he can hither range. Thou shalt not need to shew y? cause, but bid him come in haste: And tell him if he tarry long, his stay will breed him waste. The Footboye. I haue bin there, loe Simple coms he is at hand, I see Him come: loe here he is, say on, whatso your pleasure be. Simple. God saue you sir, loe here I am, Poore men must stoope, and yet the more they yeeld, the more they are opprest. your message I obey: Both I and mine to your commaund as subiects here this day. The Rich-man. I thank thee Simple, welcome now, I thank thee for thy payn, I sent for thee, come walke with me, thou shalt goe soone againe. Good Simple, doe one thing for me, and I will be thy friend. It is (indeede) a small request: in brief Ile make an end. And thus it is: the Grange thou hast, and lands by lease of me. Faire wordes moue men to doe that they after repent.It wilbe eighteene yeares and more, before it ended be. I must request the same in hand, And I will set thee, where Thou shalt be sure, to liue as wel as euer thou didst there. It is a place so fit for me, thou maiest not me withstand, But graunt me back my state again, ile build there out of hand. Simple. Oh Sir, I trust, you will not so oppresse me seely man: If I forgoe my Farme, I must seeke dwelling where I can, Desire it not Landlord I pray, on knees I doe request: I came with willing minde to you, The mildnes of the poore, make the rich often more cruel. but now with griefe opprest. I humblie pray you be content, craue not my liuing so: It makes my heart with bitter sighes, to burst it selfe for woe. The Rich-man. Wherefore? I will bestowe on thee, By flatterie or threatning, by hooke or by crooke, he will haue it. A place as good as that: And stand thy faithful friend at need, thou doest thou knowest not what, Denying me so small a thing: which gentlie I request, But yeeld it vp I say or else, thou shalt haue little rest. Simple. Where shall mine wofull wife become? The rich regard not a poore mans griefe, but their owne pleasure and profit. what shall my childr? doe? Ten tender Infantes, all vndone, this fact of thine shall rue. Haue some remorce, therefore on vs, let pitie pearce your brest. Seeke not to suck, your sweete of me, alreadie thus opprest. The sharper to the poore, the sweeter to the rich.Who gaue an Incum, great God wot and yearly rent, not small, To pinch at euery quarter daye, my carefull heart withall. And gape you yet, for greater gayn? to greeue me more &amp; more? Nay, gaine is past, &amp; now you seeke to get me out of dore. The poore-mans petition, makes the rich man the prouder.Good landlord let these words suffise, let mercy moue you so, That I may now departe againe, worke not my further woe. It greeues me to forgoe the thinge concerning me so neere. Content your selfe therefore, I may not buy your loue so deere. The Rich-man. The countenaunce of the rich makes the poore man quake.Ah, are you at this point indeede, hath scripture taught you this To vse such taunting words at him that farre your better is? Yet law hath twenty trickes again, which I haue learnd of late: The couetous man hath no regarde to the equitie, but to thextremitie, to worke the poore much woeTo make such beggers as thou arte, to forfaite their estate. Wherefore be sure to pay thy rent, according to the day Or else be sure I will not slacke to thrust thee cleane away. And other Couenants there are, (although thou haue enioiyde Thy lease with quiet; which may soone make all thy ?time? voide. And if I finde a hole therein, what law may doe, be sure, To feele the smarte, if golde or fee, Threatning and flatterie seeme contraries, and yet in nature coosen Iermaines, workes of mischiefe. thy torments may procure. Content thy selfe therefore &amp; yelde vnto my small request: And I will stand, at need, thy friend, and when thou arte opprest. Simple. Alas, is there no shift to shun, Voluntarie dispaire. this forced cause of woe? Must I be forst against my will, my liuing to forgoe? Well, then I know my wife and I with all our children, must Goe beg our bread, goe steale, or sterue, to satisfie your lust. The Rich-man. Faire wordes is franckest when the game is fairest.No, no, thou shalt not begge thy bread, thy wife, ne Children shall Goe steale, nor starue for want of foode, nor be opprest with thrall: If thou wilt yeeld thy lease againe, Of all the Grange to me: Dissimulation is not daintie in the ambitious man.I will doe any thing in deede, wherein to pleasure thee. By word, or deede, to ride, or goe, to lend, or giue, be sure, I will be ready at thy neede, while life, and lymbs indure. Simple. Dotage in doubte.Thus if you doe, I am content to satisfie your will: But if I thought the contrarie, I would retaine it still. The Rich-man. He will cut his throat first, and lay a plaister afterwardes.Doubt not the contrarie, but fetch thy Lease in hast to me: Ile cancell that, and then I will, doe what I can for thee. Simple. A small demaund.Then graunt that I may keepe the same this quarter, that I may: Prouide for my poore familie, some other where to stay. The Rich-man. Wel, bring thy Lease I wil not stand, He promiseth honie, and giues gall. vppon a thing so small: I will doe any thing I can, to pleasure thee withall. Simple. Here is the Lease, doe what you wil, therewith, I am content, But sure my wife dooth sigh so sore, Qui ante non cauet, post dolebit. as though her heart would rent. And all her children crie to see, their Mother in that case: Would God you would vouchsafe to show me wofull man some grace. To let me haue my Lease againe, and I will pray for you: Or else no flintie heart, but may, mine happe, to heauie rue. The Rich-man. Nay, nay, pray not for me at all, The poore mans griefe, a pastime to the rich. these wordes be but in vaine: Tis nought to me, although thy wife and children, waile amaine. Wherefore (I say) prouide a place, packe from the Grange in hast: The promise of honie performed with gall.Thou shalt not tarie there (in deed) if this weeke once were past. I wil not slack my building so, nor spend the time so long: Hence, hence, thy peeuish prattle doth, my weightie causes wrong. For I will presently in hand, t-accomplish my desire: Bagges of golde and siluer, are the egges whereon Sathan sits abroode, to breede young Diuils, to torment th? that put their confidence therein.I haue laid baggs enough in store, to paye the workemens hyre. I would it were now finisht faire, according to my will: In finest wise as might be done, by mans inuentiue skil. But long it shall not be I trowe, Till it be brought to passe: That I may sit therein and say, a brauer neuer was. Wealth, and a gay house, foolish and vnperfect felicitie.And in delight to passe my dayes, in such a princely place. Who would not be in pleasant plight to stand in such a case. Solace. Oh foolish man, oh mortall wight, God sendeth men knowledge of their error, onely of loue, to win them to saluation. in wofull state art thou, Thy soule accurst, a thousand times, for sinne, vnlesse thou bowe. Hath Sathan thus be-witched thee? hath worldly wealth vndone? That sacred threed, that Iesus for thy sweete Saluation spun? Then, th?, wo worth the daies wherin thy cancred corps doe liue Through foolish wil, to fond delight, such rash consent to giue. The Rich-man Why, what art thou, that tauntest thus The trueth, is straunge to the woldly ones, whose wits are occupied about transitorie, and vaine causes. The riche, measure other mens wisdome and honestie, by their owne wealth. and thus controulest me? I know thee not, nor Iesus, whome thou saiest my friend to be. Let for thy wealth or his, I know cannot my wealth surpasse, My riches are as great (I trowe) as Iobs aboundance was: And yet to see thy taunting termes, thy carping crakes at mee, Doe make me muze, y? thou wilt not bow to mine high degree. I think thou doest not know my welth my state vnknowen thee, Makes thee so rash: I pray thee shew, thy wealth and name to mee. Solace. The greatest wealth, is côtentation.My wealth is a contented minde, my name, a name of blisse: No sweeter or more wholsome name in all the earth there is, My will it is lykewise to wyn, thy sinfull soule from woe, To kill these wicked weedes in thee, that in aboundance growe. The Rich-man. Mans blindnes can not see the miserie of this world, nor vnderstand the perfect happiness of heauen.Canst thou redeeme the soule from woe, that is in passing ioy? Whom nothing can oppresse at all, or worke the same annoy? If furious foe, should seeke to spill: my bloud, or worke my thrall: My goods are great, I haue enough, to purchase helpe withall. Monie accepted as a God, to redresse manie miseries.If health of bodie doe impaire, and sicknes doe possesse My Corps with grief, my goods can get, best Phisick for redresse. What if a time of dearth should come to pinch the poorer men? Then were the time, for me to make, of euery penny ten. For I haue store of euery thing, Where there are all things at will to content the flesh, there is seldome any thing to quicken the spirit. that would be present gayn: As Sheep and Oxen, fruict and wul, and euery kind of graine. Which ten yeeres dearth could neuer spend, what can annoy me then? I liue secure, I am at ease, I stand no dreade of men. What saist thou now, am I in case to seeke for ayde of thee? Many may, but few haue reliefe of the wealthie. No, no, goe packe, a thousand maye haue their reliefe of mee. Solace. The Rich-man. What, what, you run at random, sir your wits are not your owne: Worldlinges doe perswade th?selues to liue for euer &amp; that there is noe God to take againe what he hath giuen them. But make Fortune the Author of happynes.I think poore man with tauntinge termes your wits are ouerflowen Doe I possesse that is not mine? whose wealth is that I haue? Whose is the substance of the store, which friendly fortune gaue? Is not the golde that I haue got, mine Oxen faire and fat? My flocks of sheepe mine own? pore man thou saist, y? knowst not, what. But tame thy tongue, or vse thy termes in better sorte to mee: Take other mates for thine estate, I am no mate, for thee. Solace. Alas that sillie soule of thine, dooth rest in wofull case: It can not choose but rue to see, thee runne so retchles race. What though thy bodie liue at ease, It is the fashi? of fickle Fortune to fauour to day and to frown to morrow. But the surest hold of happines is to trust in God. and wealth abound at will? Wilt thou lyke witles wretch giue thanks for foolish fortunes skill? In fickle state (alas) art thou, dame fortunes wheele vnsure: Can turne thy wealth to wante agayne when thou art most secure. Thy sillie soule is sunck in sinne, whose due deserte is woe, Wherefore returne againe in time It is a rare matter, to finde a man willing to forgoe his wealth, or to take the losse of his aboundance with patience. to friend, and flye thy foe. The Rich-man. What should I flie, oh foolish wight, my Landes, mine onely stay? My store, my stuffe, my bagges of gold, and cast my wealth away? No, no, Ile know from whence thou art, thy name, thy force and will: Before thy cunning shall conuert, my Conscience to thy skill. Solace. The Rich-man. This answers not to my demaund, I aske thy name, and why The arrogant man is loth to be reproued but if he feele himselfe manifestly touched with his fault he wil put on a stout face, and couer his wickednes with audacitie.Thou doest controule me thus, for that a care to liue haue I. I will avouch and verefie, which I haue said before I am not yet afraid: I knowe such preachers are there store, That crye in euery pulpit still, woe worth the wealthie ones, They threaten with the plagues of hell yea all the plagues at once. But seeke not thou, euen so to set, my stately state at naught, Bee not too bold, I am no babe, I see what sleightes are sought. To sucke the sweete of such as I, that haue such wealth at will, But showe thy name perchaunce I may, attend vnto thy skill. Solace. The sweetest solace for an offender, is pardon for his crime.My name as earst before I said, Is wholesome, pure, and sweete: True Solace, for a sinfull Soule, whome Sathan luls a sleepe. The Rich-man. Wordlings accept of no Solace, but what is for the bodieIs Solace then your name in deede? for thee then I haue sought, With great expence, with carke and care, with all my will and thought: And wandred farre and neere about, my countrie here and there. To settle me in sweetest soyle, good Solace showe me where. And what may beste delight the minde of him who hath in store A world of wealth, yet still I wish, with all my heart for more. Solace. Thy sences foolish man doe erre, thy fancie flies too fast, Thou feedst thy follie like the flie, that fryes in flame at last. Doest thou suppose my comming is, The word of God is not to draw men to, but to withdraw men fr? sinne. to solace thee with sinne? No, no, it is to call thee from, the error thou art in, The Rich-man. Why saist thou so? Solace I seeke, If thou be Solace, say, I am: and I am he that will, all pleasaunt thinges obey. Want not for gold nor siluer deare, Nothing too deare for the fleshe, but euerie trifle accompted too deare for the Soule. ask what thou wilt, for fee, No price shall passe, aske what thou wilt, and I will giue it thee. Solace. I craue not gold nor siluer man, Heauenly comfort reuealed to none that haue their whol delight to fulfill the will of the flesh.thy fees I doe defy: These profers doe thy wicked heart, oh Sinfull man discry. I see thou sauourest all of sinne, true Solace, is no share, For thee, nor for such wicked ones, that thus affected are. Leaue of, Leaue of, therefore in hast, these fond conceits of thine. And to mine healthfull counsaile see, thine heart thou doe incline. Let Sathan sit no more within, thy brest to rule thy will. Feeding thy fancie with delightes, of worldly pleasures ill. Looke thou into the Gospell true, the word of life and light, And thou shalt see (as in a glasse,) thy selfe in sinfull plight. The Rich-man. This solace is contrary to the rich mans expectation.What? what? is this, the Solace which thou wilt reuiue withall: And winne my sillie Soule in hast, from paine and pinching thrall. He that perswadeth a worldling from his inordinat cares of the world, he accepteth him as his vtter enemy. Too much affiance in a ches is enmittie to God. Quite contrarie to my request, yea, to my sodaine woe, I thought thou hadst bin for my tooth but loe thou art my foe. Solace. No, no, I am thy faithfull friend, and thou a foe to me, Which thou shalt well in fine perceaue was cause I came to thee. The Rich-man Well, well, say on, proceede to shewe thine whole intent in hast, Be breefe, I pray, the euening comes on vs, thou seest full fast. Solace. Attend thee then, let pleasure passe, and hearken what I say, My Solace shall be sweete, in fine, if thou my wordes obay. The Rich-man. Trueth vnpleasaunt to the wicked.This soundeth not lyke Solace man this fils my heart with woe: This is to driue them to dispaire, that with aboundance floe. Solace. No, no, but hearken thou a while, what I shall say to thee: For euery man is not accurst, that is of rich degree: As shall appeare hereafter plaine, examples here ensue. Of Dauid, Iobe, and Abraham, belieue them, they be true. The rich-man. Oh hold thy peace, and say no more, my wittes are cleane bereft: Thy words haue sackt my sences so, I haue no comfort lefte. Solace, Well then, adue, farewell, I will too morrow come againe: Sith night is come, farewell, doe not these words of mine disdaine. But think vpon thy former waies which thou hast past in sinne: In fine, my solace shall be sweet for thee to solace in. Godly meditations for him whose heart is infected with coueitousnes. Incline mine heart O Lord vnto thy testimonies and not to couetousnes. Psal. 119. Oh tvrne awaie my eyes, least they behold vanitie and quicken me in thy way. Eodem. 14. Take away the rebuke that I am affraid of, for thy iudgements are great. Eodem. 42. THE TVESDAY, or second daies conference betweene Solace and the sinfull man. VVherein (after long perswasion) &amp; (vnderst?ding by many examples of the iust iudgement of God against worldly minded men, and the greedy desire of wicked gaine,) beginnes to consider that hee hath greatly erred, in reposing his trust in transitorie riches, and in his aboundance, to sell the ende of all happines: And falles into a kinde of dispaire, wherein he vttereth his griefe, and afterward receiueth comfort, Solace, shewing himselfe to be Christ, &amp;c. The sinfull man. Oh sinfull soule of mine sing forth, the dolefull tunes of woe: Let sobs &amp; sighs, let trickling teares from thee like fountaines floe. Let groanes in griefe, bee nowe thy gaine, let sorrow beare y? swaie: Let Solace passe, for thou hast loste, thine health and wonne decaie. Oh worth, oh worth mee, wicked wretch wo worth y? day wherein, That my rebellious mind did giue the first consent to sinne. Wo worth the day wherein I was, seene first of womans eye: Would God my life had ended when I first began to crie. Then should not thus my silly soule bene wrapt in irkesome woe, Nor it haue felt the carefull thrall that now is forste to showe. My heart should not haue harborde woe nor c?science cause to weepe: That nowe in griefe doth groane to see, it selfe in torments deepe. But then, ten thousand times I had bene happie in my death: Ten thousand times vnhappy now that I enioy my breath. Wherefore prepare oh graue in hast to take thy share of mee: And death doe thou thy duetie too, I yeeld mee now to thee: For all my pleasures now are gone my mirth to mourning cheere Is cha?ged quite: my ioyes are past, now gryping griefes drawe neer: That greeue my silly soule so sore, my corps consume full fast. Oh death deny mee not therefore, but take mee hence in haste: The God that sits in Christal skies hath cast mee cleane away. No hope of helpe, no hold I haue, good death make no delay, No pardon due for my desert, my sinnes deserue to die: I linger like a lothsome wretch, in deepe dispaire I crie. Come death, &amp; end my doleful daies, deferre it not, make haste, I loth to liue, yet dread to die all hope of helpe is past. Solace. Oh wretched man, what is y? cause thou mournest thus in woe? Leaue of to crie and come to mee, why doste thou sorrowe so? The thrall is great that thou poore wretch doste seeme to sorrow in, Shew me y? cause: be of good cheare I sollace men in sinne. The sinful-man. See the corrupti? of nature that imputeth the cause of his griefe to him that would cure his deadly disease.Wo worth if thou be Solace, who was yeasterday with mee: He was the cause of this dispaire, Yea, none the cause but hee. Solace. The sinfull-man. Oh, say no more, I am vndone, I crie, but all in vaine: In deede I am in darkenesse deepe, thy words augment my paine. Solace. Thou art deceiued, in deede I am, the Solace that will ease: This doleful plight of thine w? speed and wrath of God appease. Christ the l?be of God that taketh away the sinns of the world.I am that lambe of God that came, by God my fathers heste: By death for true repenting soules, to purchase lasting reste. Although our sinne be as red as Scarlet, Christ can make it as white as Snowe.Although thy sinne the Scarlet doe in rednes farre surpasse, My death shall make thy soule as white as whitnes euer was. Wherefore, returne to me in haste amend what is amisse: I am the God that pardons him, that true repentant is. Therefore giue care attend vnto, these comforts of my will: Beleeue, amend, doe not dispayre, conuert thy selfe from ill. The sinfull man. Art thou in deed that Christ so pure, whome Iudas did betray: And whom y? Iewes torm?ted sore, as sacred scripture say? Solace. Ye I am he that hung on crosse, Christ the sacrifice for sinne.fast nayled to the tree: A sacrifice, to pacifie, my fathers wrath for thee. The sinfull man. Wo worth me then, for thou art hee, whome I offended soe: That in dispaire I languish here, a wicked wretch in woe. Dispaire.Oh let the mountaines fall on mee, to hide my sinne from thee: Let death approach, let gaping graue, take nowe their due of mee: I dare not looke on thee, whom that my sinne offended so, No, no, thou wilt not pardon mee, thou art (of right) my fo. Sathan the author of all dispaire.And Sathan seekes as erst y? saydst, to winne my soule from thee: I am content, to his request, I willingly agree. I can not now reuoke againe, my promise readie past: Wherefore I knowe noe remedie, I must be his at last. Solace. The sinfull man. A great conflict I feele in deede, a fight of furious fiends, Within my minde: a troope of foes, whome subtile Sathan sends. Who with dispayre doe so beset, and ransacke all my will: That nothing can appease the rage, that pricks mee forth to ill. Wherfore (I know) no boote to seeke Those that yeeld themselues seru?ts to sinne, are in great subiection to Sathan. to shunne my raging thrall: For Sathan binds mee to attend, when he or his doe call. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh, worth mee wretch: then I am none of whom saluation came: For I haue disobeyd thy will, and led my life in blame. And rest in Sathans bands a slaue, by due desert I die: Oh death make haste, my Soule, in sinne, for thee is forste to crie. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh what should I poore sinner doe? whose sinnes surpasse the sand In number, which the surging seas and waues haue cast on land. No wit, no wisedome, or good will, Hard winning of a desperate man. doth rest within my brest, Thy wordes are all in vaine to me, I am bereft of rest. And know not how to winne again thy fauour which is lost: In dolefull plight I striue in vaine, to yeeld vp guiltie ghost: That earth might passe to earth againe, of which it first begun: My soule where it deserues to be, an wofull ghost vndun. Solace. Wilt thou (oh man) continue still so hard of heart in woe? Refusing so the fruites of grace, that from my mercie floe? Whereby thou mayst, at libertie be set, from force of foe: Reclaimd from sinne and Sathans will, to rest no more in woe. Repent therefore (I say) repent, turne thou to me in haste: Giue eare vnto me once againe, be yet reformde at last. Such is the loue &amp; mercy of Christ, that he seeketh by all meanes to winne vs fr? Sathan.Thou shalt perceiue that I forgiue all sinners when they crye: Not wishing any sinfull soule in such dispaire to dye. The sinfull man. Oh Solace doth thy mercy, so abound to pardon me? Although like stinking filthie cloath my life appeare to thee. If Sathan held me not in band, fast linckt in fetters fell: Who roares like raging Lyon, wh? I doe determine well. Full faine I would returne to thee, whose mercy now I see: And do perceiue that Satan seekes Sathan seekes to draw men first into dispaire, and th? to cut of their owne dayes. the meanes to murther me. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh Solace, I appeale to thee, in heart I doe request: That y? wilt shewe the perfect path, to thy surpassing rest. I doe perceiue from Sathan thou, by death hast set mee free: But tell me what I must beleeue, and doe to come to thee. He labours yet within my brest, and faine would haue me gone: He tels me flat that comfort thou, in fine, wilt shewe me none. For I am his, (he sayes) and he will haue me in the end, Good Solace (if thou can) doe thou, this cause of mine defend. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh passing comfort now I feele renue in me againe: Me thinkes I heare that Sathan saies, now is my labour vaine: Which I and mine haue had w? him, that now conuerted is. Me thinkes I heare him rage, y? I should take the way to blisse: But let him fret and fume his fill, and doe his worst to me: I doe not force: my sure refuge good Solace is in thee. True comfort doth begin I see: encrease it more and more: And let that furious feend leaue of to vexe my soule so sore. And shew what I must doe in haste, because the night is nye: For I intend to follow thee good Solace, till I dye. Solace. The ende of the Tuesdayes Conference. THE VVEDNESDAY, or third daies Conference, betweene Solace and the sinfull man Whereas the sinfull man was yesterday striken with dispayre of being saued, by reason of his manifold offences, which Solace proued, and his conscience confessed him to bee guiltie of: receiuing some comforte againe, by the sweete counsaile of Solace. Now Solace beginneth to prescribe him the way that he must begin to take to become a newe man. The sinfull man. Loe Solace here I am to day, as thou appointest mee: Thy counsaile is so passing sweete, I long full sore for thee. Solace. Then here am I attend, giue care, imbrace my counsaile deare: If thou be sorie for thy sinne, it will full soone appeare. And doe with faithfull heart beleeue the Solace which I showe: Repenting truely all thy sinnes: on me lay all thyne woe. And cast the burthen of thy sinne on me, without delay: Be strong in faith, attend to me, and gad no more astray. The sinfull man. Oh, Solace art thou readie here, loe, I attend thy will: But for repentaunce and for faith, as yet doe passe my skill. Solace. The sinfull man. Yes, with good wil, good Solace shew at large what thou hast sayd: Proceede to finish in mine heart, the plat which thou hast layd. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh rare and passing thing is this, a glasse of heauenly skill: Whereby on earth I may behold in thee, thy fathers will. Solace. The sinfull man. A sharp c?clusion, which doth seeme the summe of all: whereby, The faithfull ones shall liue for aye: and vnbeleeuers die. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh Solace, should my whole beleefe, be grounded on you three? Then shewe I pray thee more at large, What my beliefe must bee. I doe alreadie vnderstand, that faith must be the eye: Whereby I must expect to haue, saluation from on hye. I doe belieue: helpe vnbeliefe, and shewe thy selfe to mee: I doe repose my confidence, and all my trust in thee. Solace. The sinfull man. Would GOD the night were not so neere, thy talke delighteth mee: Encrease my fayth: to morrowe I, will waite againe on thee. The ende of the VVednesdaye, or third dayes Conference. THE THVRSDAY, or fourth daies Conference, betweene Solace and the sinfull Man. Wherein the sinfull man confesseth his Fayth, and is instructed by Solace, what repentaunce is, and what are the fruites thereof, and the things that hinder it. Solace. Where art thou man, that yesterday, didst promise to be here: Come forth, attend, beleue in mee, let fruitfull faith appeare. The sinfull man: Oh, Solace, art thou here so soone, this day to meete with mee: Say what thou wilt, I doe beleeue, attendant here on thee. Solace. The sinfull man. I doe remember yesterday, The definition of faith.thou didst define to mee: That faith y? fountaine of my weale was confidence in thee. Whereby I might behold before, what after should appeare: And be assured by thy death, of my saluation here. Solace. The sinfull man. First, I doe beleeue The beliefe in God the father. in God my maker deare, Who framde of nought the Land and Seas: the heauens high and cleare. The Sunne, the Moone, the firmament, the crystall starry skies: The things that are inuisible, and eke before our eyes. And of the dust who framed man, in perfect shape and pure: In image as he is himselfe, for aye so to endure. Of him he formed Eue to be, a comfort to the man: And placed them in state of blisse, in Eden Garden, than. There to remayne without distresse, in perfect blisse for aye: But that the subtile Serpent did, most falsely them betray. And they like disobedient wights, did yeeld vnto his wyle: Who as a iust reward they had, from their estate exile. And all that come of Adams line, through Adams sinne do fall: Deseruing death by due desert, and thus came first our thrall. And then our God of passing loue, most sory for our sinne: Did promise that the womans seede, should our saluation winne. And promised to Abraham, to giue his sonne to saue Mankind, from Sathans tyrannie as I beleeue he gaue. Thy selfe sweete Iesus, I beleeue, who were coequall than: With God thy father were content, to be both God and man: To come into this vale of woe, and walke amongst vs here: To shewe for our saluation, thy fathers wisdome clere. Borne of the virgine Marie pure, as was before decreede: That thou that shouldest saue vs all, shouldest come of womans seede. Whose Godhead and humayne state, should linke them selues in one: Inuisible and visible, and not be here alone. The heauenly counsaile did decree, thy selfe as man to dye: And as a God againe for vs, exalt thy selfe on hye. And when thou here in earthly soyle, in humaine weedes belowe: Didst wander: I beleeue thee then, like other men to growe. To shewe thy selfe as man to vs, in humayne state to be: In eche respect a man in deede, from sinne yet onely free. And wast content, to beare reproch, to suffer cruell Iewes, To buffet thee, to spit at thee, and thee full vilely vse. Who sought by many wylie meanes to take thy life from thee, Procuring wicked ministers, to punish thee for mee. False witnesses vniustly came, accusing thee of ill: And thou a lambe most innocent, were well contented still. And when the time appointed came, wherein thou shouldest die: Thy torments were so terrible, were forst as man to crie. My God my God in my distresse, Why haste thou leaft mee thus? No tongue can tell the great conflicts, which thou hadst then for vs. Wherein thou gauest vp the ghost, vnto thy father deere: Discending to the deepe of hell, to clense vs sinners here. The wrath of God thy father was, to Adams sinne so great: That nothing could but thou his sonne, his loue againe intreat. Who on the Crosse I doe beleeue, with heart and tongue confesse: That thou for all offenders then, didst purchase due redresse. For our offences willingly, thou didst accept to dye: And to be layd in graue as man, and seene with humayne eye. The third day after to aryse, againe out of the graue: And to ascend aboue the Skies, to whome, thy father gaue Thy former glory and the seate, at his right hand againe: Where thou as Lord of all and some, doste with him now remayne. And there a Mediator true, for sinners here belowe: Thy selfe in mercie merueilous, vnto thy father showe. And when the time is full compleate, from thence I doe beleeue: In iudgement thou wilt come againe, to all mankind, to giue Their iust reward of life or death as they deserue to haue, Who then shall take the flesh againe, they caried to the graue. And those that doe remayne aliue, shall quickly changed be: The wicked to their endlesse woe, and iust shall goe with thee. Into that seate of passing blisse, that neuer shall haue end: And those that thou shalt find vniust thou wilt with Sathan send. The holy ghost I doe likewise, Beleefe in the holy ghost. in heart confesse to be: Whome I doe faithfully beleeue, to be all one with thee. And with the father, who are three, in parson, but (in deede) In substance one, a Trinitie, in vnitie decreede, Which holy ghost doth sanctifie, thy chosen ones to liue: Assuring all men to be thine, that faithfully beleeue. And those to be an holy church, a congregation pure Whome Sathan can not with his wiles, from thy precepts allure. Dispersed through the world so wide, yet faithfully agree: In faith, in baptisme, and good will, vnited all in thee. As to their head and chiefe defence on whome they doe depend: And whome with mightie hand thou doste, most graciously defend. And they like faithfull children doe communicate in one: And doe not vse thy benefites, eche man by him alone. But what thou dost on one bestowe he doth impart to all, And eche in godly loue supports another, least he fall. Whose sinne I faithfully beleeue is pardoned in thee, Who by thy death I doe beleeue: hast made mee likewise free. And that our bodies now corrupt shall rise againe in fine, In purerest wise, and them into thine hands againe resigne. And that our soules and bodies shall, the heauenly ioyes possesse: For euer more encrease my faith, that I beleeue no lesse. Solace. The sinfull man. Increase my faith, I am corrupt, which keepes mee dull perforce: The flesh is fraile.My flesh is fraile, my will is weake, good Solace shewe remorse: And what, as yet, doth want in mee, vnfold the same in hast: That I a sinner may repent, of all offences past. Solace. The sinfull man. Say on (good Solace) I attend, I long in heart to heare: The course of this thy purpose pure, which is to mee so deere. Solace. The sinfull man. All this I can, and will performe, We may not presume of our selues to doe any good thing. yea, what thou wilt I shall: I yeeld my self with willing mind, for thee to beare it all. Solace. The sinfull man. Alas what must I sinner doe? whereto poore wretch must I Imploye my self? I thinke there be no shift but I must dye. I will like wofull wight in hast, The death of Christ tooke these ceremonies awayof hayre-cloth make my bed: And clad my carefull corps in sacke, and cast dust on my head. In mourning wise to pas my daies, and pinch my self with fast, As my forefathers did, that I may purchase blisse at last. Solace. The sinfull man. But must I not sometimes abstaine my careles corpes from meate? Or is it lawfull when I list, all kindes of meate to eate? Solace. The sinfull man. An hard sentence for the couetouse men.Alas must I restore againe the things I doe possesse, Which I haue gotten heretofore, or am remedilesse? Then, woe is mee, I am vndone, my state, will then decay: Good Solace pardon that, and I will all things els obey. Solace. The sinfull man. Then loe I will restore in hast, the landes and Graunge againe: To Simple: and no other man, shall losse by me sustaine. We must not onely say we will, but we must doe thus But will the poore, and needy man, releeue that are opprest: And then I trust, I shal possesse, at last eternall rest. Solace, The sinfull man. Alas my conscience dooth accuse, me guiltie of them all: I must confesse my carelesse life, hath well deserued thrall. But, loe, in hope, I hold by thee, my sinnes I will declare To thee, who dooth already see, that they corrupted are. Wherein I liued long secure, bewrapt in wealth at will. I runne a race, that now I rue: and lingred long in ill: Uouchsafe that I with heart &amp; hand, may now restore againe: The things which I by fraud haue had, of any man for gaine. And shewe what further dooth belong, to traine me to thy blisse: Uouchsafe to shew that I may come, where all true Solace is. Solace. The sinfull man. Then will I hasten me away, to finish it in haste: And in the morning hasten me againe to thee as fast. The ende of the fourth dayes conference. The end of the Thursday or fourth dayes conference The Fryday, or fifth dayes c?fer?ce, between Solace, and the sinful man That were the sinful man being yesterday perswaded, to redeliuer those things vnto Simple, his Tenaunt, which he had by flatterye &amp; threatning gott? of him: As also to make restitution of all his wrongful gotten goods to other men, hee did it accordingly: And when hee had giuen euerye Birde his Feather; hee became so naked, and his estate so bare, that for his suddayne chaunge, he cryeth out in great heauines, on this wise: Solace comforting him, and willeth him to beare the matter with patience and to confesse his sinnes. &amp;c. The sinfull man. Alas, the life that late I did in precious price imbrace, Is past and gone, and poore estate hath taken riches place, My Peacocks plumes are pluct full loe, that flickred erst so hie. Mine hautie harte in heauie chere, doth wonted ioyes deny. Where riches did ere while abound, and bagges of golde were store: Now want hath wonne the field again wo worth me wretch therfore. Solace. What is the matter, oh sinfull man, that this morning, thou beginnest thus, as a man best laughted, shewing thy self yet subiect to frailty, which thou yesterday diddest promise manfully to withstanay The sinfull man. Oh (Solace) helpe, I am vndone, now past are pleasant daies, What thou didst will is done, &amp; nowe my stately state decaies. My substance all, alas is gone, now Simple and the rest Haue had their shares of all my store, my share alas is least. I am vndone, I know not how, to maintaine mee and mine: I doubt I shall be sore opprest, with poore estate, in fine. And that my Children shall be forste for want, to begge their bread, Why should we liue in this distresse? wold they and I were dead. This hard estate of mine, I know would break an hearte of stone: For that in my distresse, I haue no wher to make my mone. For those, that did before acquaint themselues as friends to be. Will now disdaine my poore estate, and looke awry on mee. Unles it be for my reproch to say, loe, this is hee, That was aloft but now is lowe, what shall mine answere bee. Solace. The sinfullman. Alas my poore estate is such, I am so sore decayde: No man can blame mine heauines, if mine ill hap were wayde. Solace. The sinfull man. Oh how could he with patience, these cruell crosses beare: It can not be but that he did, in griefe himselfe beteare. Solace. The sinfull man. Th? shewe me how I should c?fesse, and how I ought to pray: I doe repent my sinfull life, That I haue led astray. Solace. The sinfull man. Before I doe confesse to thee my sinne, thou doest beholde The same at large: what need I th? my sinnes thus to vnfolde. Solace. The sinfull man. Th? what auaile good works? are they of none effect in deede? And bootes it not to keepe the lawes that Moses first decreede? Solace. The sinfull man. Then Lorde of lords, oh Solace sweet Oh loving Iesu deere: Whose passing power, by word of trueth created heauens cleere: The Sea, that surgeth too and fro, the earth and Creatures all: Thy wisdome, is surpassyng high, thy mercies great withall. So that, the workes which thou hast done, doo all depend on thee: And I among them all, the woorst, crye, come Lorde, come to mee. Who am a Uessell, fraught with wo, whose dayes are past in sinne: My nature proane to wickednesse, reteines mee yet therin. But thou that art the God of blisse extende thy mercie meere: Let not the furious Feend preuaile, against thy Creatures, heere: Thou canst attend, before I crie, support, before I fall: Thou canst relieue, before I craue, forgiue, before I call. Thy grace, is of so great effect, thy counsaile (Lord) so pure, That whome thou wilt preserue and keepe, remaineth most secure. Thou art of grace, the giuer true, the God of mercie meere: Who wouldest not that Sinners die, but turne to thee in feare. So that (Oh Lord) abounding so, with loue and mercie store: Thou didst vouchsafe to send a salue, to cure my cruell sore. Thy onely Sonne, delight and ioy, who came in humaine weede: Into this vale of deepe annoy, to kyll the Serpents seede. Who did betray, and bryng to woe, our former Parentes twaine, Whom thou hadst set in blessed state, for aye there to remaine. And I poore wretch, the seede of sinne so subiect unto yll: Haue swerued from y? word of trueth and sore transgrest thy wyll. Imbracing with great greedinesse, my substance and my store: Which I, by couin and deceit, haue gotten heretofore. And in delight haue past my dayes as Sathan rulde my will, I framde my fancies all and some. to thinges peruers and ill. Haue mercie, mercie, Lord on mee whoe haue deserued thrall. Refuse mee not, though I be dust, by nature proane to fall. Blot out of thine accompting Booke, what I haue done amisse: Oh, pardon my Offences all, and place my soule in blisse. Wash me from all vngodlinesse, make soule and body cleene: That not a spot of filthinesse, in neither may be seene. I doo confesse (O Lord) to thee, I doo confesse my sinne: And doo condempne my selfe of all, that I haue liued in: I am a frowarde Childe to thee, prouokyng thee to Ire: But, Lord, vouchsafe, call mee againe I would full faine retire. From wandring in such vanities. to walke the wayes of light, Extend thy loue, Lorde, let me liue, from hence, a life upright. I disobeyed thy Preceptes, and did what Nature would: I did not that, that Uertue wyld: and what, of right, I should. Most wickedly I walked, in the wayes that were vniust: Esteeming filthy Carcase so, as it had not ben dust. Oh Lorde, I stood no feare of thee, nor reverenst thy name: But, as a disobedient wretche. haue lead my life in blame. Thy Lawes, I cast behinde my back and doo not them fulfyll: I follow with all greedinesse, mine owne corrupted wyll. I haue most lewdly, lead my life, without remorce of minde: Neglecting true repentance styll, to wickednes inclinde. I roue at randone, too and fro, from sinne to sinne I runne: And therin wallow, as the Sow, in durtie soyle, in Sunne. The Solace, whiche I should haue shund I sought with gredinesse: And shund the Solace, which I shuld haue held, as happinesse. Which thou (O lord) thou doost behold yea, what I thinke or saye: What I haue done, and what I doo, and how I gad astraye. How I despised thy commaund, and how I breake thy wyll, How like a senceles man I run, by rash conceit to yll: Wherfore, I neede to say no more, my sinnes, my soule annoy, Mine heart, doeth harbour such conflict, that gone is all my ioy. Solace. Dispaire not man, let sorrow passe, take solace now of mee: I am the God, that neuer was, nor wyll vnfaithfull bee: My mercie, is a thousand fould, to him that doth repent: Repent (therfore) saye on, be bould, the contrite is not shent. We must not only, confesse our sinnes: but we must leaue them, and forsake them.What? if thou be a sinfull man, in hart, repent, therfore: Be sure, thou shalt haue pardon then but see thou sinne no more. The Thiefe, that hung on tree w? mee, as he gaue vp the Ghost: Did craue, that he might saued bee. whose praiers were not lost: And Marie Magdaline, that was, a sinfull woman, came To mee, in heart, repenting sinne, and I forgaue the same. By death (I say) I ouerthrew the Serpent, and his trayne, Mine heauenly fathers wyll, I dyd obey without disdaine. Upon the Crosse, with euyll men, my Corps were nayled fast: Not as a Sinner, but for thee, when helpe of hope was past: Proceede therfore, confesse in haste, All men haue sinned. what thou hast done amisse: For Sinne, I know, remains in thee, as in all men there is. The sinfull man. Then Lorde, I see, thou doest beholde with thy supernall eye: The creaturs which in thraldome bee, and hearest when they crie: I sinfull soule, distressed sore, in plungyng pangues of woe: Doo craue the cr?mes of mercie store which from thy Table floe. For, Lorde, I see that thou art prest, to ease my sinfull sore: Refuse me not, vouchsafe mee rest, in heart, that call therfore. Who by my sinfull lyfe, haue lost, thy loue: and purchast thrall: Extende vnto mee, wretched wight, thy light, and loue withall. Oh, Lorde, my God, forget mee not, hyde not thy selfe from mee: Although my flesh do striue to keepe, my syllie soule from thee: Showe not thyne anger, as a foe, let mercy be my staye: It is no profite (Lord) for thee, to cast my soule awaye. Denie mee not, a contrite heart: a pensiue person poore: An wofull wretch, a sinfull soule, that knocke here at thy doore. Uouchsafe, to turne thy face to mee, forgiue my deedes amisse: In feare, I doo appeale to thee, as one that guiltie is: Deale not, as my deserts doo craue, but as of mercie, thou, Doost will, and still delight to haue, all sinfull heartes to bow: Showe not thy force against thy foe, that faine would come to thee: And pardon my Offences all, though Death be due to mee. Oh, plague mee not (good Lord so sore I haue no force, I fall. I neuer wyll offende thee more, if thou vouchsafe to call, My soule from sinne, and to affoord, mee Solace sweete againe. Loe, here, I doo against my selfe, a sinfull wretch complaine: Shame dooth beset mee round about my selfe consume in woe: I am corrupt, mine heart throughout I wander too and fro. From sinne to sinne, I run perforce, I wander styll astraye. Wherfore, without thy due remorce, I can not but decaye. Since first I suckt my Mothersbrest yea, since I sawe the daye: The subtill Serpent, hath not ceast, to wrest mine heart astraye. In sinne, my mother did conceaue, this cankred Corps of mine: And Sathan seekes (Lord) to bereaue, all that (of right) is thine: He soweth vaine and wicked seedes, in mine vnstaid brest: Wherof doo grow pernitious deedes, which breede my soule vnrest. Which I as yet cannot auoyde, they fixe so fast one mee: That fr? my youth they haue anoid, and keepe me (Lord) from thee. So that I am full bought and sould, betwene the Feend and synne: And wickednes a thousand foulde, myne heart doth lodge within. The good I cannot which I would, my nature proane to ill: Withdraws myne harte fr? what it should imbrace w? heauenly skil. But (Lord) in sinne why should I dye, syth thy good will is so: To heare poor synners wh? they crie, and them redeeme from woe And giuest them, repaste againe, from heauens high aboue: And to repentant hearts full faine, thou showest thy selfe in loue. Ye, thou doest saue through mercie meere those that deserue to dye, When they to thee returne in feare, (oh Lorde) now so doe I: A thousand times before this date, thy mercies from aboue. Haue saued them that went astraie, to showe thy zealous loue: Our fathers, who were longe agoe, when they were in dystresse: Fell prostrate on their harts, and loe, thou gauest them redresse: Ye, wh? they were incompast round and no hope to auoyde: Thy mercye Lord did so abounde, that they were not destroyed: Haue mercie therfore (Lord) on mee, oh god on whome I call. I wretched synner here to thee, on prostrate heart doe fall: Ease mee againe, let mercie thine, myne woefull hearte releeue. And let not synne all goodnes mine, through loosenes thus bereaue: My soule alas, in dolefull plight, in hope of helpe doth crie: Oh Lord extend thy louelie light, that shines from heauen hye: To guide my silly soule to blisse, by shunnyng what is ill. High time, alas, good Lord it is, to frame mee to thy will. Wherfore, extend thy grace againe, put foorth thy helpyng hand: Let it reuiue, what sinne hath slaine, and loosen Sathans bande. Lorde Iesus come, oh come in haste, Let Heauens Bowe come down That I a wretched wight at last, maye ioye that passing Crowne. Which y? by dreadful death hast won through pl?ging panges on tree: In loue, to giue the same to those, that feare to fall from thee. Come, come, I say, thou Solace true and fill mine hart with ioye: My sinfull soule, with grace renue, whom Sathan would destroye, No daye, no time, no minute is, deuoyde of wo, to mee: But (oh alas,) the cause is this, I hold mee not by thee: If thou absent thy selfe, my soule, my bones, my bodie dust: Corrupt, with carke of wicked will, as Iron doeth with rust: If thou absent thy selfe, my soule runnes headiong into yll: And staggerryng too and fro, it reeles and kickes against thy wyll: Yf thou absent thy selfe, my soule, like wretched wight opprest: Fast fettred in the boultes of sinne, lyes groaning voyde of rest: Yf thou absent thy selfe, my soule, sinckes into darkesome thrall: But (Lord) driue darknes far fr? mee sende light and loue withall: So sinne shal passe, and vertue flow within my dolefull brest: Oh Iesu, come, Oh, come in haste, to set my soule at rest. And thus, my soule I doo commende, into thy bosome sweete: On whome, I doo in heart depende, heere prostrate, at thy feete. Solace. Take heed, take heed, Oh sinful man, When we confesse our synnes, we muste take heed that it be not only in the tongue but from the hart. let heart and tongue agree: Leaue off to sinne, repent foorthwith and I wyll dwell with thee. Cast of the Cloake, that is the cause, to hinder thine intent: Thy sinne, and then, in deede, I wyll, to my request consent. The sinfull man How shuld mine heart &amp; toong agree? what meanest thou therin? I haue (at large, thou maist perceiue) vnfoulded all my sinne. Solace, The sinfull man Show mee therfore, what must I doe and what must I obeye? Uoutchsaufe mee grace, I doe repent, my gaddyng longe astray: Solace. The Ende of the Frydaye, or Fyfth Dayes Conference. The Saturdaye, or sixth Dayes Conference, betweene Solace and the Sinfull man. Wherin, Solace, sheweth him, what is to bee done, and what left vndone, to attaine to the perfection of Christianytie. The Sinfull man. Good Solace, loe, here I attende as one that longes to heare: What I must doo and leaue vndone: I giue attentiue care: Solace. The sinfull man. Good Solace, then proceede in hast, true comforte now appeares: This comforte doth abandon woe, and wipe off all my teares. Solace. The sinfull man. Uouchsafe, good Solace, to declare, now, more at large to mee: These ten Precepts, which doe set foorth the way to come to thee. Solace The sinfull man. This sweete conclusion c?forts me, who can not but confesse: That these thy Lawes like wicked wretch, I daily doe transgresse. But sith thou freely doest obtaine, the loue of God for me: Uouchsafe me grace to mortifie, my sinnes to come to thee. And sith the night drawes on so fast, passe to the rest in haste, I will attend vnto the ende, forgiue offences paste. Solace. The sinfull man. Alas, then in what case am I: if death be due to mee: What doth auaile, y? I haue heard so many things of thee? What shal I do, mine heart impleat with fearefull pangs of woe: Had bene as good at first as now, to yeeld vnto my foe. Solace. The sinfull man. Now doth that Solace sweet appeare which thou hast promist mee: And that mine owne deserts are not the meane to come to thee. Thy merites are mine onely stay, thy mercie meere extende: Let faith in thee direct my life, my words and thoughts amend. The darkesome night is come, I see there is no longer stay: Tell mee, good Solace, neede I not come yet another day. Solace. The sinfull man. With willing minde I will attende, mine heart doth long to see Those heauenly ioyes, wherein I trust at last to liue with thee. The ende of the Saterdaies Conference, betweene Solace and the sinfull man. THE SVNDAYE, and last dayes Conference, betweene Solace and the sinfull Man. VVherein Solace directeth him in prayer, which is the principall and last work, belonging to the attainement of eternall life, by faith in Christ. Solace. The sinfull man. Ye, Solace, loe I looke for thee, mine onely comfort deare: Whose comfort now I find, in deed, proceede from heauens cleare. And therefore I attend on thee, mine only guide and stay: Whom thou doest call, I see cannot gad like a wretch astray. Mine heart is set to seeke the way (through thee) y? guides to blisse: Whereby I shall at last possesse the ioye, that perfect is: Which I in heart by faith doe feele, though in this vale of woe: Where Sath?s forces fell abound, and sinnes by custome growe. Which vale, I long to leaue in haste, to take my rest with thee: In heauens hye, where only ioye and nothing els can bee. Solace. The sinfull man. Alas I knowe not how to aske, nor what true prayer is: I long to learne so sweete a meane, to bring my soule to blisse. Wherefore, declare to me in haste, how I must pray aright: Mine heart is set to seeke the thing, so pleasaunt in thy sight. Solace. The sinfull man. What are the thinges, for which I ought most specially to pray: Instruct me, that from hence I may thy sacred will obey. Solace. The sinfull man. Declare thou these thinges more at large, (good Solace) that I may: In faith be stirred vp in thee, for what, and when to pray. Solace. The sinfull man. Loe then I see that praier is, through thee, the meane to haue: What so I want, if that in faith, and trueth, the same I craue. And that vnfained thankes, I must giue, for his passing loue: Wherein he doth vouchsafe releefe, from heauens high aboue. Solace. The sinfull man. Al thanks &amp; praise oh Lord I doe in humble wise commende: To thee who doest such solace sweet vnto poore sinners sende. Wherewith thou hast reuiued so, my sinfull soule from woe: That tongue c?not thy praises due, for want of wisedome showe. But yet as farre as heart and t?gue can giue, I yeeld to thee: Accept it Lord, though passing thankes thou doe deserue I see. For when I was in sinfull plight, in Sathans bands opprest: Thy tender Sonne came downe to mee to shewe the way to rest. My soule did harbor all that was vnto my soule annoye: But he hath fraught y? same againe, with all surpassing ioye. My darknes he hath turnd to light, wherein I see the way That leades to life &amp; how to shunne what led me long astray. The pleasant shewes and fawning cheere of worldly wealth, I see, The fond delightes &amp; peeuish toyes, did worke but ill for mee. Therewith I was puft vp aloft, with plumes of pride so hye: That nothing did remaine for me, but iust desert to dye. For, sinne a thousand folde, I did within myne heart retaine: A burning zeale there was in me, to heape vp foolish gaine. My heart was led w? deepe delight, myne eyes did gaze awrye: My truethles tongue within myne head, for greedie gaine did lye. No pittie or compassion was, within my careles breast: A thousand cares of worldly wealth my wicked heart possest. I thought not on an others woe, I passe not for his paine: I spared not to pinch the poore, to reape my selfe the gaine. And thus I liued long secure, in sinfull soyle a sleepe: Till Solace came and did awake me, out of slumber deepe. And set before my blinded eyes, the reckles race I runne: Which now I see I must forsake, or rest (for aye) vndone. Wherfore all praise in heart I yeeld, oh Lord of Lords to thee: Unto thy Sonne, and holy Ghost, for thus receiuing mee. Oh how sweete are thy wordes vnto my throate, yea, sweeter then honie vnto my mouth. Psal. 119. Death where is thy sting? hel where is thy victorie? the sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the law. But thankes be vnto God, who hath giuen vs victorie, thorowe our Lord Iesus Christ. 1. Cor. 15. A farewell to the Booke. I If thou (oh sillie Booke) doe chaunce to light into the hand O Of any, such as takes delight, ech others worke to scand: H Heare with good will what they will say: take not in greefe, disdaine. N No Booke so good, but gets reproofe, and trifeling toyes the gaine. N No praise exspect, way not dispraise: ech man will verdict giue O Of thee and me, but haue regarde how he or they doe liue. R Rash iudgement doth vnstayed mindes, in ech degree bewray: D Disdaine thou not the deadly doomes, therefore of such as they. E Euen so, farewell, in ragged shewe, thou must depart from mee: N Not pullisht as some pleasaunt Bookes, that profite lesse then thee. Si Deus nobiscum quis contra nos. FINIS.</field>
