      <field name="fulltext">The Psalms of David. Psalm I. 1 The Man is blest, that walketh not With those that wicked are: Nor in the way of Sinners stands, Nor sits in Scorners Chair. 2 But in the holy Law of God Doth set his chief delight; And constantly doth meditate Thereon, both day and night. 3 He shall be like those pleasant Trees, By Rivers that are seen, Whose Fruit in season never fails, And Leaves are fresh and green. 4 All things shall prosper that he doth; The Wicked are not so: But like the Chaff, which by the Wind Is driven to and fro. 5 Therefore the Lord no wicked Man In Judgment will acquit: Nor in the number of the Just The Sinner will admit. 6 For in the way of righteous Men The Lord doth take delight: But wicked Mens designs and ways Shall fall and perish quite. 2. Metre. 1 Happy is he, who never strays With wicked Men in Council met: Nor standeth in the Sinners ways, Nor proudly sits in Scorners seat. 2 But makes the Law of God most high His only joy and hearts delight: And on that Law continually Doth meditate both day and night. 3 He shall be like those Trees so fair, By sides of Rivers to be seen, Whose Fruits in season still appear, And Leaves are ever fresh and green. 4 Thus God will prosper his designs; But wicked Men are nothing so: But like the Chaff, which by the Winds Is toss'd and driven to and fro. 5 Therefore the Lord will not acquit The Wicked in the day of Doom; Nor will ungodly Men permit Among the Just to find a room. 6 For righteous Men, and all their ways, The Lord Beholds with great delight: But wicked Mens designs and ways Shall surely fall, and perish quite. Psalm II. 1 Why do the Gentiles rage in vain, And Jews with them combine? The Kings and Rulers of the Earth Do all in Council join. 2 Against the Lord, and Christ his Son, They all conspire and say, Come, let us break their Bands from us, And cast their Cords away. 3 But God from Heav'n shall them deride, And, in displeasure sore, Shall in this manner speak to them, To vex them still the more: 4 See, I have set him to be King Upon my holy Hill; And he, in spight of all your Plots, Shall reign in Sion still. 5 And now I will declare to all The words of the Decree; âThou art my Son; this very day âHave I begotten thee. 6 âAsk me, and I will freely give âThe Heathen lands to thee; âThe furthest parts of all the Earth âShall thy possessions be. 7 âWith Iron Scepter thou shalt rule; âAnd, if they scorn thy Yoak, âShalt dash them all in pieces small, âAs Potters sheards are broke. 8 Ye Kings and Rulers of the Earth, Consider then in time: With fear and trembling serve the Lord, And bow your selves to him. 9 Humbly adore, and kiss the feet Of his beloved Son; Lest his displeasure should arise, And you be all undone. 10 For if his wrath shall once begin To kindle in his breast; Happy are they that make their peace, And on his Mercy rest. Psalm III. 1 How many, Lord, against me rise, My Soul to vex and grieve! How many cry blasphemously, God cannot him relieve! 2 But thou my Shield and Glory art, And dost uphold me still: And when I cry'd, didst hear my voice From thy most holy Hill. 3 I slept, and safely rose again; For God was still my aid: And though ten thousand me surround, I will not be afraid. 4 Rise then and save me, O my God, And shew thy wonted Power: For thou the jaws of wicked Men Hast broken heretofore. 5 Salvation to the Lord belongs; He only can protect: And they that are thy faithful Flock Thy Blessing may expect. Psalm IV. 1 Hear me, O just and righteous God, Who from distress and pain Hast oftentimes delivered me, Now hear me once again. 2 How long will ye, O Sons of Men, This glorious God despise? How long will ye vain Idols love, And follow after Lies? 3 Know ye, that good and holy Men Are his peculiar choice: And therefore when I call on him, The Lord will hear my voice. 4 Then stand in awe, and sin no more Against his holy will; But quietly upon your Beds Consider, and be still. 5 The Sacrifice of Righteousness Unto the Lord present: Then of his help in time of need You may be confident. 6 Most Men enquire, where worldly Goods And Treasures they may have: But grant to us thy Favour, Lord; That Treasure, Lord, we crave. 7 In that my heart shall triumph more Than theirs in corn and wine: Their vintage, and their harvest joys, Shall not compare with mine. 8 Then will I lay me down in peace, And quietly will sleep: For thou alone wilt me, O Lord, In perfect safety keep. Psalm V. 1 Give ear unto my words, O Lord; Consider what I say: Listen to me, my King and God, For I to thee will pray. 2 My Supplication thou O Lord, Shalt in the Morning hear: And looking up, I will direct My prayer to thine ear. 3 For thou, O Lord, art not a God That pleasure takes in vice: No wickedness shall dwell with thee, Nor stand before thine eyes. 4 The Lyar, and the Man unjust, The Lord doth hate them both: The bloody and deceitful Man He doth abhor and loath. 5 But I into thy house will come, In thine abundant Grace; And worship thee with reverence Before thy holy place. 6 Lord, lead me in thy righteous ways, Mine Enemies watch me so: Teach me, and help me then, O Lord, In thy streight paths to go. 7 For in their mouth there is no truth, Their heart is naught and wrong; Their Throat an open Sepulchre, They flatter with their Tongue. 8 Destroy them quite, and let them fall By Counsels of their own; And in the midst of all their sins, Lord, cast these Rebels down. 9 But let all them, that trust in thee, Their Shouts to Heaven send: And all, that love thy name rejoice, That thou dost them defend. 10 For thou upon the righteous Man Wilt pour thy Blessings out: Thy Grace and Favour, like a Shield, Shall compass him about. Psalm VI. 1 Lord, in thy wrath correct me not; Thy Fury hot restrain: Have mercy, Lord, for I am weak, My Bones are fill'd with pain. 2 My Soul is griev'd how long, O Lord, Shall I tormented be? Return, and for the mercies sake, O Lord, deliver me. 3 For who of thee amongst the dead Can any knowledge have? Or who can celebrate thy praise, And glory in the grave? 4 I make my bed to swim with tears, All night I weep and wail; Mine enemies have made, with grief, My very eyes to fail. 5 But now depart away from me, Ye wicked workers all: For now the Lord hath heard my voice, And seen my tears that fall. 6 My Supplication he hath heard, And will receive my prayer; And all my foes shall covered be With shame and with despair. Psalm VII. 1 Save me from them that me pursue; O God, I trust in thee: Lest they like Lyons tear my Soul, And none to rescue me. 2 O Lord my God, if I have done Unjustly and amiss; Rewarded ill to Friend or Foe, And lest them in distress: 3 Then let them hunt, and take my Soul, And cast me to the ground: Yea, let them tread into the dust My life and honour down. 4 Rise, Lord, and quell mine Enemies, Let not their rage proceed: Awake, and execute that doom That is for them decreed. 5 So shall thy people thee surround With Songs of Victory, Then, for their sakes, return, O Lord, And shew thy self on high. 6 Thou righteous Judge of all the Earth, O judge and deal with me, According to mine innocence, And mine integrity. 7 Thou know'st the heart of every one, Their purpose and intent: O let the wicked be consum'd, And save the innocent. 8 God is my shield, who still defends The upright in his way: He tries the good, but angry is With ill Men every day, 9 Unless they turn: he whets his Sword, His Bow is ready bent; And every Arrow is prepar'd To be deaths instrument. 10 Behold a Man with malice fraught, Big with Iniquity; Who many mischiefs hath conceiv'd, And brought forth treachery: 11 Yet when he has prepar'd a pit, And cunning traps has laid: He falls into the ditch himself, Which he for others made. 12 Upon his head shall surely fall His mischief and his spite: His violent dealing shall return, And on his pate shall light. 13 These righteous dealings of the Lord Aloud declare his fame; For which I will for ever sing, And praise his holy name. Psalm VIII. 1 O Lord, how wondrous is thy name, How glorious and how great! Earth cannot comprehend thy fame, Nor Heaven thy mighty seat. 2 Thou, by the mouth of sucking Babes, Canst bring great things to pass: He quell'd the Enemy by his word, Who first an Infant was. 3 When I behold the glorious Skies, The works of thine own hand; The Moon and Stars, which thou hast made, As Lamps in Heaven to stand: 4 O what is Man, Lord, then I cry, That thou dost notice take? Or Son of Man, that thou to him Dost such a visit make? 5 He who abased was a while, And less than Angels made, With Honour, and with Glory now Is crowned, and array'd. 6 Thou hast appointed him the Lord And Sovereign over all: And every Creature, thou hast made, Beneath his Feet must fall. 7 The Fowls, that in the Heaven move, The Beasts upon the Land: And all the Fishes in the Sea Are under his command. 8 Therefore with an admiring Heart My Song I will repeat, O Lord, how wondrous is thy Name, How glorious, and how great! 2. Metre. 1 O Lord, how wondrous is thy Name! How great thy Glory, and thy Fame! Through all the Earth thy Praises ring: Nor can the Heaven it self so high Contain the boundless Majesty Of such a great and glorious King. 2 By Man, at first a sucking Babe, A glorious Conquest thou hast made: And did'st ordain, thy Foes to quell, That he, who from an infant grew, Should by his word alone subdue The Prince, and all the Powers of Hell. 3 When I behold the skies so bright, The Moon and Stars that rule the Night, Those wonders which thy Hands did make: O What is Man, Lord, think I now, That thou do'st him such favour show, And of our kind such notice take! 4 For he, who for a little space Endur'd the Griefs of humane Race, And lower was than Angels made, Is now become a King renown'd, At thy right Hand with Glory Crown'd, And in Majestick State array'd. 5 Him Lord of all thou didst ordain, And hast appointed him to reign, Till all things at his Feet shall bow: And that thy works in every place, His Royal Dignity to grace, Should all to him subjection owe. 6 The Beasts that in the Forests go, The Fowls no less, and Fishes too: Therefore I will admiring sing, O Lord, how wondrous is thy Name! How great thy Glory and thy Fame! Through all the Earth thy Praises ring. Psalm IX. 1 Thee will I praise with my whole heart, And all thy Acts proclaim: I will rejoyce, O thou most high, And sing unto thy Name. 2 At sight of thee mine Enemies flee, Fall down and perish quite: For thou upon thy Throne dost sit, And dost maintain my right. 3 The Heathens fall at thy rebuke, The wicked are destroy'd: Their very Names and Memories For ever shall be void. 4 Then boast not, O thou Enemy, That Cities razed are: For God remaineth still the same, And doth his Throne prepare. 5 He righteously will judge the World, And uprightly proceed To rescue them that are opprest, And help them at their need. 6 All they, that know thy Name, O Lord, Will thee their refuge make: For such as thee sincerely sought Thou never didst forsake. 7 Sing Praises then unto the Lord Who doth in Zion dwell: The mighty Acts, that he hath done, To all the People tell. 8 When he for Blood of Innocents Shall inquisition make, The humble he will not forget, But certain vengeance take. 9 Have mercy then on me, O Lord; Consider well my pain, Who when I am at gates of death, Canst lift me up again. 10 Within the gates of Zion then Thy praise I will advance; And joyfully will celebrate This great deliverance. 11 The Heathens fall into the Pit, Which they themselves have made: Their foot is taken in the Net, Which they for others laid. 12 In this the wisdom of the Lord Most plainly doth appear, When wicked Men are to be caught, Their hands shall make the snare. 13 The wicked he will cast to Hell, And those that God forget: But never fail the humble Man, Whose hope on him is set. 14 Rise, Lord, and let not Man prevail; Such dreadful judgments send, That all the Nations of the World May know they are but Men. Psalm X. 1 Why standest thou so far, O Lord, When trouble is so nigh? Why hidest thou thy face from me In mine adversity? 2 For in his pride the wicked Man Doth persecute the poor: Let him be taken in the snare, That he contriv'd before. 3 He boasteth of himself, and saith He hath his hearts desire: The covetous, whom God abhors, He chiefly doth admire. 4 So proud he is, that he disdains To seek to God by prayer: What ever else is in his thoughts, The Lord is never there. 5 His ways are grievous, for he puts God's Judgments from his Eyes: And proudly puffs, and makes a scorn Of all his Enemies. 6 He says he never shall be mov'd, But prosperous ever be: And vainly hopes he never shall An alteration see. 7 His language is to curse and swear, To flatter, feign, and lye: His tongue is full of nothing else But spite, and vanity. 8 In secret holes he hides himself, To slay the innocent: And privily against the poor His eyes are ever bent. 9 To catch the poor he coucheth down, Like Lion in his Den: And when they come within his net, Devours the harmless Men. 10 He says the Lord has quite forgot, And will regard no more: Rise then, O Lord; lift up thy hand, And think upon the poor. 11 Why should the wicked scorning say The Lord will not requite? Convince them, that thou wilt repay Their mischief and their spite. 12 The poor commits himself to thee, Thou sav'st the fatherless: Break thou the arm of evil Men, And search their wickedness. 13 Then shall we say the Lord is King, And shall for ever stand: When all these Heathens are destroy'd, And driven from his Land. 14 Unto the humble Man's request, Lord, thou hast lent an ear: Thou wilt prepare their heart to ask, And cause thine ear to hear. 15 To vindicate the righteous cause Of poor and fatherless: And that these vile and earthly Men No longer may oppress. Psalm XI. 1 In God the Lord I put my trust: How say ye then to me, Make hast away, and save your self, As Birds to Mountains flee. 2 For see the wicked bend their Bows, And make their arrows fit, And privily they take their aim, The righteous Man to hit. 3 If strong Foundations be destroy'd, Sure good Men are undone. No. God is in his Temple still, And Heaven is still his Throne. 4 His piercing Eyes do all Men try, Beholding bad and good: But from his Soul he hates the Man Of Violence and Blood. 5 And surely will from Heaven at last Snares, Fire, and Brimstone rain: Such Tempests shall the portion be Of that ungodly train. 6 For righteousness, the righteous God, Who cannot but approve, The upright and the innocent Can never cease to love. Psalm XII. 1 Help, Lord, for good and holy Men Decrease and fade away: The innocent and faithful Man Grows scarcer every day. 2 The whole discourse, when neighbours meet, Is idle, loose, and vain: Dissembling now and flattering Is grown the common strain. 3 But flattering lips God will cut off, And tongues that proudly say, We will prevail; our lips are ours: What Lord should we obey? 4 The poor and needy are opprest, But now will I arise, And save them saith the Lord from those, that proudly them despise. 5 God's word, like silver seven times try'd, Remains most pure and good: And he will ever save his flock From this ungodly brood. 6 The wicked then shall wondring gaze, And walk on every side, To see how good Men are advanc'd, Whom they so vilify'd. Psalm XIII. 1 How long wilt thou forget me, Lord? Will it for ever be? How long wilt thou upon me frown And hide thy face from me? 2 How long shall grief and thoughtfulness Torment me every day; And to insulting enemies Shall I become a prey? 3 Consider me, O Lord my God, And hear when I complain; Lighten mine eyes, lest that I sleep, And never wake again. 4 Lest that mine enemy boasting say, I have subdu'd him quite: And they that trouble me rejoyce To see me put to flight. 5 But I, who in thy Mercy trust, Will still rejoyce in thee: And sing because the Lord has been So bountiful to me. Psalm XIV. 1 There is no God, the foolish Man Doth in his Heart suppose: No wonder then, if in his life All filthy lewdness flows. 2 The Lord look'd down from Heaven to see If any understood: But all were foul and filthy grown, And none whose life was good. 3 These workers of iniquity Have they no sense at all, That eat God's People up as Bread, And never on him call? 4 But though the poor, that trust in God, These wicked Men deride: His Terrors shall convince at last, That God is on their side. 5 O when will he from Sion help, And back his Captives bring; That Jacob may rejoyce in him, And Israel may sing. Psalm XV. 1 Into thy Tabernacle, Lord, What Man wilt thou admit? Or who in Heaven thy holy Hill, May hope with thee to sit? 2 The Man whose life is innocent, Who hates deceit and wrong; Nor, what he thinks not in his Heart, Will utter with his Tongue. 3 Who not to hurt his neighbours fame, Such tender care doth take, He will not raise an ill report, Nor spread, what others make. 4 By whom a vile and wicked Man Is loathed and abhor'd: But from his heart he honours them, That truly fear the Lord. 5 Who having bound himself by Oath, Though to his loss it be, Will faithfully perform the same, So true and just is he. 6 Who scorns by bribes or usury The poor Man to oppress: Who thus doth live, shall surely have Eternal Happiness. Psalm XVI. 1 Lord save me, for in thee I trust; My Soul hath said to thee, Thy true and faithful Servant, Lord, I will for ever be. 2 And, tho' my goods thou needest not, Yet on thy Saints below, The Excellent, whom I so love, I freely them bestow. 3 Though others follow Idol Gods, No Offerings I will make: Not yet their vile and cursed names Into my lips will take. 4 The Lord is my Inheritance, My portion and my lot: And I a pleasant heritage, And happy share have got. 5 Thanks be to God, who counsels me, How I may walk aright: And with good thoughts doth me inspire And teach me every night. 6 The Lord is ever in my sight, He is at my right hand, Whose Kingdom cannot moved be, But shall for ever stand. 7 This makes my heart to leap for joy, My mouth in praises 'ope; To think of that immortal Prince, Whose flesh shall rest in hope. 8 For thou wilt not permit him long In bands of death to lie; Nor leave thy dear and holy One In Grave to putrifie. 9 But raise him up to life again, And cause him to ascend To sit in Heaven, at thy right hand, Where joys shall never end. Psalm XVII. 1 Attend my cry, O righteous God, Which in sincerity I make to thee, and judge my cause With truth and equity. 2 Thou art the searcher of the heart, And therefore I intend, That neither in my secret thoughts, Nor words I will offend. 3 And as for Men's pernicious ways, Thy word has been my guide; Preserve me, Lord, and keep me so, My steps may never slide. 4 I oft have called upon thee, Whose promise is to hear: Perform it, Lord, and to my speech In mercy lend an ear. 5 The wonders of thy mercy shew, Who sav'st by thy right hand All those, that put their trust in thee, From such as them withstand. 6 Keep as the apple of thine eye, With greatest tenderness, And hide me underneath thy wings, From them that me oppress. 7 For, Lord, my deadly enemies, That compass me about, Are such as wallow in their wealth, Whose words are proud and stout. 8 They compassed my steps about, And did observe my way, Like Lions lurking in their dens, They watch to seize their prey. 9 Rise, Lord, defeat, and cast them down, Who thus my life pursue; Draw forth thy sword and save my life From that ungodly crew. 10 From those that have their portion here, Who Wealth and Children have: And if they can but leave them rich, No greater Blessing crave. 11 But let my Portion ever be Thy Favour and thy Grace; That with the just I may awake, And ever see thy face. Psalm XVIII. 1 Thee will I love, O Lord, my Strength My Rock, and place of Power; My God, my Refuge, and my Shield, My Saviour, and my Tower. 2 I on the Name of God will call, To whom all praise is due: And so shall I preserved be From them that me pursue. 3 The snares of death surrounded me, And like a mighty flood, The wicked came to swallow me, And they that sought my Blood. 4 I call'd upon the Lord my God In my distress and fear; And from his holy Temple he My voice and cry did hear. 5 Great Earthquakes then, &amp; mountains rent, His anger did proclaim: A smoke was from his nostrils sent, And from his mouth a flame. 6 In clouds the Lord from Heaven came down Mine enemies to pursue: Swift as an Angel, or the Wind, His mighty vengeance flew. 7 Black clouds, with furious tempests big He made to be his tent: And dreadful lightnings, mixt with hail, Before his presence went. 8 Together with his thunders loud, He shot his arrows out: His lightnings slew the wicked crew, And scatter'd them about. 9 The channels of the Sea were seen At thy rebuke and frown: The strong foundations of the earth Were turned upside-down. 10 He sent and drew me from the floods Of them that were too strong: Nor suffer'd them that hated me To do me any wrong. 11 In my distress they laid a snare, But God my part did take, And in my straights enlarged me, For his good pleasures sake. 12 The Lord hath weigh'd the innocence And justice of my cause: Because I did not him forsake, But kept his holy laws. 13 His word was ever in my sight, My life from vice was free; And after my integrity He hath rewarded me. 14 For, Lord thou wilt be merciful To them that mercy shew; The upright Man and the sincere, Thou lov'st sincerely too. 15 The pure that true and faithful are, Thy faithfulness shall find; But froward Men thou wilt repay According to their kind. 16 Thou dost delight to save the poor, And haughty looks debase; And in my dark and low estate Wilt shew thy lightsome face. 17 To break through troops of enemies, I helped was by thee: To scale the Walls of Cities strong, My God enabled me. 18 God's way is perfect, and his word Is try'd and found most just: A buckler he will be to all That on his promise trust. 19 My God and my Almighty Rock, O Lord thou art alone; My strength by whom in all my ways I have in safety gone. 20 Swift as a Hind thou mak'st my feet, To save my self by fight; Or if in battle I engage, Thou teachest me to flight. 21 By thee I broke the bows of steel. Thou art my shield alone; 'Tis thy right hand hath held me up, And rais'd me to a throne. 22 Thou mad'st my feet both swift and sure When I my foes pursu'd: Nor did I cease to follow them, Till I had them subdu'd. 23 Wounded they fell before my feet, They fell and rose no more; And by thy help I am become A perfect conqueror. 24 By thee I trode upon their necks; They cri'd, but none to save: Yea to the Lord, but all in vain, For he no answer gave. 25 Then did I beat them small as dust, That by the wind is blown: I cast them out, like mire and dirt, That in the streets is thrown. 26 Thou hast preserv'd me in the broils, Within my Kingdom bred: And of the Nations round about, I am become the head. 27 Strange Countries shall submit to me, When of my fame they hear: And foreigners to me shall crouch, And hide themselves for fear. 28 Blest be the living Lord, my Rock, My God exalted be; Who conquers all my enemies, And hath avenged me. 29 'Tis he that has delivered me From all my enemies: But chiefly from the violent Man, That did against me rise. 30 Therefore will I in Heathen Lands, Give thanks unto thy Name: And in the Countries round about, Sing praises to the same. 31 He saves his King, I then will say, And keeps his promise fast To David, and to Christ his Seed, Whose Throne shall ever last. Psalm XIX. 1 The Glory of the Lord most high The Heavens declare abroad: The Firmament doth plainly shew The handy work of God. 2 Day unto day, and night to night, Proclaim their Maker's fame: There is no Nation in the world, That has not heard the same. 3 By all the Earth as in a Book, They may be seen, and read: Throughout the corners of the world, Their mighty sound is spread. 4 A Tabernacle for the Sun, In them the Lord hath made: Who as a bridegroom cometh forth, Most gloriously array'd, 5 And as a Giant, round the world, Delights to run his race: Spreading his heat and influence, About in every place. 6 Most perfect is the Law of God, And doth the Soul convert: His word is sure and to the weak, True wisdom doth impart. 7 The Statutes of the Lord are right, And drooping spirits chear: His precepts purifie the eyes, And make them bright and clear. 8 The fear of God doth cleanse the soul, And ever shall endure: His judgments are in all respects, Most righteous just and pure. 9 Much more to be desir'd than gold, Yea finest gold by far: The honey and the honey-comb, Not half so pleasant are. 10 By them I am admonished, They are my Fence and Guard: And they that keep them faithfully, Shall find a great Reward. 11 But, Lord, how many are the sins, That we remember not! Then cleanse me from those secret faults, That I have quite forgot. 12 But chiefly from presumptuous sins, O Lord, deliver me: That from such great and heinous crimes, I may be ever free. 13 These meditations of my heart, And prayers of my tongue Accept, O Lord, who art my Rock, And my Redeemer strong. Psalm XX. 1 Lord hear the King in his distress; O Jacob's God defend: From Heaven support him in his need. And help from Sion send. 2 Accept his sacrifices all, And offerings made by fire: Receive the prayer that he makes, And grant his hearts desire. 3 Then we rejoycing will display Our banners in thy Name: When thou shalt our petitions grant; O Lord, fulfil the same. 4 Then will we sÃ¢y 'tis God that saves His own anointed King: And with the strength of his right hand Will help from Heaven bring. 5 Some in their Chariots put their trust; On Horses some rely: But all our hope and confidence, Is in the Lord most high. 6 'Tis he alone that makes us stand, When others sink and fall: Lord save the King, then let us cry, And hear us when we call. Psalm XXI. 1 The King in thy salvation, Lord, Shall triumph and rejoyce: For thou hast granted his desire, And listned to his voice. 2 A crown of gold thou gavest him, Not looked for before: He asked life, and thou didst give, Ev'n life for evermore. 3 Great glory, power, and majesty, Thou hast upon him laid: And he a great and happy King Is by thy favour made. 4 He trusts in thee, and through thy grace, He shall for ever stand: Thy enemies shall feel the force Of thy almighty hand. 5 In wrath thou shalt consume them all, As in a furnace hot: Their seed shall perish from the earth, And children be forgot. 6 Thou wilt defeat their ill designs, And frustrate all their spite: Thy arrows, which thou wilt prepare, Shall put them all to flight. 7 Be thou exalted still, O Lord, And shew thy mighty power: So will we to thy honour sing, And praise thee evermore. Psalm XXII. 1 My God, my God, why am I thus Forsaken and forgot? Both day and night I cry to thee, And yet thou hearest not. 2 O holy one of Israel, Thou didst our fathers save: They trusted, and they pray'd to thee, And had, what they did crave. 3 But as a worm I am despis'd, And counted base and vile: The common people me deride, And all that see me smile. 4 They shoot their lips, and shake their heads, And say, behold the man That hop'd in God: now let him help, And save him if he can. 5 But thou art he, who from the breast, Didst take the care of me: Yea from my mothers womb, O Lord, I was preserv'd by thee. 6 Then help me in my troubles now, No helper else is found: For Bulls of Bashan compass me, And have beset me round. 7 They gape as roaring Lyons do, When for their prey they seek: I am like water poured out, And all my bones are weak. 8 My heart is melted like the wax, My strength like potsheards dry: My tongue doth cleave unto my jaws, And I at point to die. 9 For dogs have compast me about, And with their guards and bands, The wicked have enclosed me, And pierc'd my feet and hands. 10 My very bones may all be told, On me they look and stare; My Garments they divide by Lot, To every one their share. 11 But be not far, O God my strength, Make hast to me, O Lord, From ravening dogs preserve my soul, And save me from the sword. 12 O save me from the lions mouth, As thou hast done before: And from the horns of Unicorns, O Lord my life restore. 13 Then I before my brethren all Will magnifie thy name: And in the congregation great, Extol and spread thy fame. 14 O praise him, ye that fear the Lord, All ye of Jacob's race: Whom from the prayer of the poor, Has never turn'd his face. 15 To him in congregations great, Thank-offerings shall be paid: And in the presence of his saints, The vows that I have made. 16 The meek, and they that seek the Lord Upon those feasts shall feed: And praise the Lord with chearful hearts That helps them at their need. 17 The ends of all the world shall see, And turn unto the Lord: And by the Gentiles every where, His Name shall be ador'd. 18 All People shall confess to him. That he is King of Kings: And, all the great ones of the earth, Shall bring their offerings. 19 And when they to the dust shall go, The next succeeding age, Shall hear, and learn to serve the Lord, And be his heritage. 20 And so they shall from age to age, His righteous acts declare: That people yet unborn may know How great his wonders are. Psalm XXIII. 1 The Lord himself my Shepherd is, No want I need to fear: In pastures green he makes me rest, Where pleasant waters are. 2 He comforts and revives my soul, When I am faint and weak: And leads me in his righteous paths, for his great mercies sake. 3 Yea in the darksome vale of death, I will no danger fear: Thy shepherds staff is my defence, And thou art with me there. 4 My table thou hast furnished, In sight of all my foes: My head with oyl thou dost anoint, My cup with plenty flows. 5 O may thy love and mercy, Lord, Attend me all my days: Then will I in thy temple dwell, And there for ever praise. 2 Metre. 1 My shepheard is the Lord, Who takes the care of me: Since he doth me regard; In want how can I be? In sweetest grass He makes me rest, With streams refresh'd, That gently pass. 2 When I am weak and low, He doth my life sustain: And when astray I go, He brings me back again. Conducting me In his right ways, To him the praise, And glory be. 3 Yea though I walk in dale Of death, as black as night: No terrors shall prevail, My courage to affright. Why should I fear, When thou; O God, With shepherds rod, Art with me there? 4 In sight of all my foes, Thou mak'st me sit and dine: My cup with plenty flows, While they at me repine. And on my head, With ointments sweet, For banquets meet, Perfumes are spread. 5 Let goodness all my days, And mercy me attend: And then to sing thy praise, Until my life shall end, And worship thee; Thy house, O God, My fixt abode Shall ever be. Psalm XXIV. 1 The earth and every thing therein, The Lord alone hath made: His hand has on the mighty floods, Its sure foundations laid. 2 Who shall ascend into thy hill, O Lord, to see thy face? Or whom wilt thou admit to stand, In thy most holy place? 3 The man whose hands are innocent, Whose heart is clean and pure: Who hates the crime of perjury, Nor can vain oaths endure. 4 To such all blessings do belong, That from the Lord proceed: Such only seek his face aright; True Israelites indeed. 5 Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates; Ye lasting doors make room, That so the King of Glory may, Into his Temple come. 6 But who is he to whom of right, This title doth belong? It is the Lord, the mighty God, The Lord in battle strong. 7 Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates, Ye lasting doors make room: That so the King of Glory may, Into his Temple come. 8 If any ask us, who is he? Our answer is the sarme: The Lord of hosts: to him alone, Belongs that glorious Name. Psalm XXV. 1 To God, in whom I trust, I lift my heart and voice: O let me not ashamed be, Nor let my foes rejoyce. 2 Let those that wait on thee, Be ever confident: But let confusion cover them, That wrong the innocent. 3 O lead me in thy truth, And shew me Lord thy way; Thou art my God and Saviour, To thee I daily pray. 4 Remember now, O Lord, Thy mercies manifold: And all thy loving kindnesses, For they have been of old. 5 The Errors of my youth, O bear them not in mind: According to thy wonted grace, Let me thy mercy find. 6 The Lord is good and just, And he will sinners guide: The Lord will so direct the meek, He shall not go aside. 7 For all the ways of God, Are truth and mercy still, To such as keep his covenant, And his commands fulfil. 8 Lord pardon for thy name, My great offences all: For thy compassion can forgive, The great as well as small. 9 The man that fears the Lord, Him will he teach his way: He and his seed shall dwell at ease, And long the land enjoy. 10 The godly man shall know, The secret of the Lord: And unto them he will reveal The meaning of his word. 11 To thee alone I look, To pluck me from the net: Have mercy, Lord, for I am poor, And my affliction great. 12 O save me from distress; My troubles still increase: Behold my sorrow and my pain. And all my sins release. 13 Behold my enemies, How numerous they appear: How cruel too their hatred is, Which they against me bear. 14 Preserve and keep my soul; O Lord deliver me: And let me never be asham'd, Because I trust in thee. 15 Let truth be my defence, For I on thee rely: And save thine Israel, O God, From all his misery. Psalm XXVI. 1 Be thou my judge, O righteous God, And see my innocence: In thee, O Lord, I put my trust, And stedfast confidence. 2 Examine, Lord, my inward part, And try my heart and mind; I am sincere, and therefore hope, Thy mercy, Lord to find. 3 I have not with dissemblers gone, Nor with the loose and vain: I ever have abhor'd, and shun'd, The wicked and profane. 4 I'll wash my hands in innocence, And round thine altar go: That I in songs of praise may tell, What wonders thou canst do. 5 Thy tabernacle, Lord, to me, Most dear has ever been: That place wherein thy Majesty, And glory may be seen. 6 With wicked and blood thirsty Men, O gather not my soul: Whose actions are with mischief fraught, And hands with bribes are foul. 7 But unto me who am sincere, Thy grace and help afford: Then in thy house my feet shall stand, And I will bless the Lord. Psalm XXVII. 1 The Lord my Light and Saviour is; Why should I be afraid? Or who is there, whom I should fear, Since God will be my aid? 2 When wicked Men upon me came, My very flesh to eat: They stumbled in their furious hast, And fell before my feet. 3 I will not fear, though I should meet An army in the field: Though mighty wars against me rise, My heart shall never yield. 4 One thing I crave, and ever will, That in thy holy place, I all my days may worship thee, And there behold thy face. 5 Thy Tabernacle, Lord, shall be My covering and defence: I shall be hid as in a rock, Or place of confidence. 6 And now shall I be lifted up, Above mine enemies round: Therefore with songs of joy and praise, Thy temple shall resound. 7 Hear then my cry, O Lord my God, And to my voice attend: Have mercy, Lord and to my prayer A gracious answer send. 8 When thou didst say, seek ye my face, It shall not be in vain: Amen, Lord; I will seek thy face, My heart reply'd again. 9 O hide not then thy face from me, In wrath and anger hot: Thou hast delivered me before now, Lord, forsake me not. 10 Should both my parents cast me off, And no compassion take: I know the Lord will take me up, And never me forsake. 11 Teach me, O Lord, and guide my feet In paths of uprightness: Because my enemies watch my steps, To see if I transgress. 12 Give me not over to their wills, For perjur'd men arise: And such as breath out nothing else, But blood and cruelties. 13 I must have sunk and fainted quite, But that to comfort me, Once more the goodness of the Lord, I liv'd in hope to see. 14 Wait then upon the Lord, my soul, And patiently attend: Wait then, I say, for he at last Will help and comfort send. Psalm XXVIII. 1 O be not silent to my cry, My God and strength who art: Thy silence, Lord, at such a time, Will strike me to the heart. 2 When I my supplications make, O let me find thy grace: And when my prayer I present, Before thy holy place. 3 With wicked and ungodly men, Lord, let me have no part; Who carry friendship in their tongues, But mischief in their heart. 4 Give them according to their deeds, Reward them with their own: And let them be compell'd to reap, The mischiefs they have sown. 5 For they God's works do not regard, Nor mighty hand adore: Therefore he shall destroy them quite, And never build them more. 6 But blessed be the Lord my strength, Who hears when I complain: On whose support in my distress, I never hop'd in vain. 7 Therefore in highest strains of praise, I will rejoyce and sing: 'Tis he that gives his people strength, And victory to his king. 8 For ever save thy people, Lord, And bless thy heritage: Preserve them all, and lift them up, O Lord, from age to age. Psalm XXIX. 1 Give to the Lord, ye mighty ones, All glory, power and might: Before his holy temple come, And worship in his sight. 2 The voice of God with dreadful sound, Doth rend the watery cloud: The voice of God is powerful, And speaks in thunders loud. 3 The voice of God the Cedars tall, Of Lebanon doth break: It makes the mighty hills to leap, And strongest mountains quake. 4 The voice of God divides the flames, And lightnings spreads around: It makes the very wilderness, To tremble at the sound. 5 The voice of God the thickets tears, And lays the forrests bare: It frights the beasts, and makes the hinds To cast their young for fear. 6 Within his temple every one, Proclaims his power aloud; Whose seat is on the waters high, And throne upon a cloud. 7 He is that great and glorious King, Whose power shall never cease: Who to his People strength will give, And bless them all with peace. Psalm XXX. 1 I will extol thy name, O Lord, For thou hast helped me: And hast not made my foes rejoyce, At my calamity. 2 My troubled soul hath cry'd to thee, And thou hast healed it: Thou hast restor'd me from the grave, And kept me from the pit. 3 Sing to the Lord, ye Saints of his, Advance his glorious name: O think upon his holiness, And praise him for the same. 4 His wrath he but a moment keeps, His love till life doth end: And when a mournful night is past, A joyful morn will send. 5 In height of my prosperity, Lord I was too secure: I said my mountain is so strong, It ever shall endure. 6 But when thy face was hid from me, How troubled then was I! I then besought the Lord again, And thus to him did cry. 7 What profit is there in my blood? Can dust thy works relate? Can it declare thy faithfulness, And mercy celebrate? 8 Have mercy then, and help me, Lord; 'Tis done as I did say: My mourning is to dancing turn'd, My sackcloth into joy. 9 And now my tongue shall sing thy praise, And never silent be: But render thanks, O Lord my God, To all eternity. Psalm XXXI. 1 Lord let me never be asham'd, Because I trust in thee, But in thy truth and righteousness, O Lord deliver me. 2 Bow down thine ear and help me soon, Thou art my strong defence: My rock, my Fort, in whom I place, My hope and confidence. 3 In mercy lead, and guide me Lord, And pluck me from the net, And from the snares of wicked men, Which they for me have set. 4 Into thy hands, O Lord my strength, My spirit I commit: Thou art the true and faithful God, Who hast redeemed it. 5 I ever have abhorred those, That vanities regard: Let them in their false idols hope, My trust is in the Lord. 6 In thee I boast, and will rejoyce, Who hast consider'd me: And when mine enemies shut me up, Thy hand did set me free. 7 Have mercy Lord now once again, And send me some relief: For now my heart is overwhelm'd, And eyes consum'd with grief. 8 My life is spent, and all my years, With bitter sighs and groans: My grief and anguish for my sins, Hath dry'd my very bones. 9 To friends and foes I am a scorn, But most to neighbours near; Who, when they see me, turn away, As if they were in fear. 10 Like to a dead man out of mind, I now forgotten lye: As broken potsheards cast away, So much despis'd am I. 11 I hear of all their sland'rous words, And cruel plottings too: Who every where against my life, Take counsel what to do. 12 But, Lord my God, I trust in thee; My times are in thy power: O save me from mine enemies, And them that would devour. 13 O smile upon thy servant, Lord, For thy great mercies sake: And let me never be asham'd, When I my prayer make. 14 Let lying lips ashamed be, And silent in the dust, Who proudly and contemptuously, Abuse the good and just. 15 For them that fear thy name, O Lord, What mercies are in store! What mighty works were done for them, And wonders heretofore! 16 Within the secret of thy house, Thou wilt them safely hide: And keep them from the threatning words, Of all the men of pride. 17 Blest be the Lord, who saved me, As in a Fortress high: I said in hast, I am cut off, But thou didst hear my cry. 17 O love the lord, all ye his saints, Who keeps his faithful flock; And plentifully will repay, The proud that scorn and mock. 18 Be strong then, ye that hope in him, And be no more dismaid: The mighty God is on your side, Whose strength can never fade. Psalm XXXII. 1 Blessed is he whom God forgives, Whose heart from guilt is clear: To whom the Lord imputes no sin, Whose spirit is sincere. 2 Before I had confest my sin, With roaring night and day, My bones grew old, and all my flesh, Was parch'd and dry'd away. 3 At last I did resolve and say, My sin I will confess: And presently the Lord forgave, My sin and wickedness. 4 For this shall every good man pray, When thou art to be found: And shall be safe in mighty floods, When other men are drown'd. 5 Thou art, O Lord my hiding place, To keep me sure and fast: And crownest me with victory, And triumph at the last. 6 Then suffer me, O wicked man, To give thee good advice: I will instruct thee in the way, By which thou maist be wise. 7 Beware of being obstinate, Like headstrong horse or mule, Whose mouth without a rein or bit, The rider can not rule. 8 For many sorrows shall befal, The wicked and unjust: But mercy shall encompass him, That in the Lord doth trust. 9 Then let them all in God rejoyce, That him do truly fear: Sing praise to him, and shout for joy, Ye upright, and sincere. Psalm XXXIII. 1 Ye righteous in the Lord rejoyce; It is a comely thing, For upright men with chearful voice, To praise the heavenly King. 2 Upon ten stringed instruments, The harp and psaltery, O sing new songs with loudest notes, And sweetest harmony. 3 His word is pure, his works are right, His ways are just and good: And from his bounty every thing, Receives its daily food. 4 The heavens high with all their host, His word alone hath made: And heaps of waters in the seas, As in a store-house laid. 5 Let all that dwell upon the earth, Fear God and stand in awe: He spake the word, and it was done, His pleasure was a law. 6 The thoughts and purposes of men, The Lord doth bring to nought: But none can change, or disannul, His purpose or his thought. 7 O blessed is that nation then, To whom the Lord is known: And whom, as an inheritance, He chooseth for his own. 8 The Lord from heaven the sons of men, Doth severally behold: He weighs their actions and observes, Their temper and their mold. 9 No king by hosts, or men by strength, Of safety can be sure: Nor can a horse, though swift and strong, His riders life secure. 10 But they that fear and hope in God, On them he sets his eye; To save from death, and keep alive, In time of scarcity. 11 Our soul in God alone doth hope, And waiteth patiently: He only is our help and shield, In our calamity. 12 Our heart shall in the Lord rejoyce, Who on his name depend: Then as we in thy mercy hope, Let mercy us defend. Psalm XXXIV. 1 For ever will I bless the Lord, And praise him with my voice: The humble man shall hear thereof, And hearing shall rejoyce. 2 O magnifie the Lord with me; Let all exalt his name: I sought him, and he heard my prayer, And soon deliverance came. 3 Whoever look to him for help, No cause of shame shall have: This poor man cry'd and soon the Lord Did him from trouble save. 4 To save all them that fear the Lord, His angels he will send: Who as a host around them stand. From dangers to defend. 5 O tast and see the Lord is good, And from experience say, Whoever put their trust in him, O happy men are they! 6 O fear the Lord, ye holy ones; To such their is no want: With lyons sooner than with them, Provision shall be scant. 7 Come hither then, ye children dear, And to my words give heed: I'll shew you from the fear of God, What blessings do proceed. 8 What man is he that loves a life, Both prosperous and long? From all deceit, and slandering, Let him refrain his tongue. 9 All wickedness let him avoid, And godliness embrace: And follow peace as eagerly, As they that run a race, 10 The eyes of God are on the just, And he will hear their cry, But cuts the wicked from the earth, And all their memory. 11 When righteous men in trouble cry, The Lord will take their part: And is at hand to save the meek, And those of broken heart. 12 Though many his afflictions be, The Lord will set him free: And so preserve his very bones, That none shall broken be. 13 Evil shall slay the wicked man, And those that good men hate: But they that serve and trust in him, Shall not be desolate. Psalm XXXV. 1 Against all them that strive with me, My righteous cause defend: And they that will contend with me, With them, O Lord contend. 2 With shield and spear defend me Lord, And my pursuers stay: And to my soul in her distress, I am thy Saviour, say. 3 Confound, O Lord, and put to shame, My bloody enemies: Let them with shame be turned back, That cruel plots devise. 4 Pursue them by thine Angel, Lord, As wind makes chaff to fly: And let their way to make them fall, Be dark and slippery. 5 For they without a cause, O Lord, A net for me have laid: Surprize and take them in the snare, Which they for others made. 6 Then shall my soul rejoyce in thee, My bones shall all confess; Who, like the Lord, can save the poor, From those that him oppress? 7 False witnesses accused me, Of what I never thought: And they whose lives I had preserv'd, Have my destruction sought. 8 But as for me, when they were sick. I did both fast and mourn: And to my bosom back again, My prayer did return. 9 None for a friend or brother dear, Could mourn more heartily: No son could for his mothers death, Be troubled more than I. 10 But when I fell, they made a mock; Yea when the baser sort, Together met, I still was made Their table-talk and sport. 11 To save me from those lyons mouths, No longer, Lord, forbear: That in the congregations great, Thy praise I may declare. 12 Let them not over me insult, Who good with ill requite: Nor wink at me with scornful eyes, Whose hearts are full of spite. 13 For they contrive against my life, Though I have quiet been: Yea charge me openly with crimes, And say our eyes have seen. 14 All this thou hast observ'd, O Lord; Then come and make no pause: But as thou art my Lord and God, Awake and judge my cause. 15 According to my innocence, O judge and do me right: And let them not triumphing say, We have devour'd them quite. 16 O let these proud insulters all, With shame confounded be: But let them sing and shout for joy, That love and favour me. 17 Yea let them ever bless the Lord, Who doth his servant love; And all day long my tongue shall sing, The praise of God above. Psalm XXXVI. 1 The wicked man's transgressions now, To such a height arise; I needs must think there is no fear Of God before his eyes. 2 For still he flattereth himself, Till odious he be grown: And all his foul and filthy life, To God and man is known. 3 His whole discourse is nothing else, But malice, fraud, and lyes: As if he quite had taken leave, Of being good or wise. 4 Mischief by night upon his bed, His only study is: He sets himself in wicked ways; No evil comes amiss. 5 But high as heaven it self, O Lord, Thy truth and mercy be: Firm as the hills thy judgments all, And deeper than the sea. 6 Thou dost preserve both man and beast; How precious is thy love, That underneath thy wings to trust, The sons of men doth move! 7 They in thy house shall feasted be, And drink the pleasant streams, That flow from thee: and of thy face, Behold the lightsome beams. 8 To them that know thee, cease not, Lord, Thy kindness to impart: But shew thy bounty evermore, To men of upright heart. 9 Let not the proud against me come, But stay the wicked's hand: See, where they are all fallen down, And never more shall stand. Psalm XXXVII. 1 Grudge not to see the wicked man, In wealth to thrive amain: For like the grass that is cut down, He soon shall fade again. 2 To trust in God and to do good, Still let it be thy care: Then in the land thou long shalt dwell, And find a plenty there. 3 Delight in him and he will grant, Whatever thou canst say: Commit thy cares to him alone, And he will find away. 4 The Lord as clear as day at noon, Will make thy innocence: Then rest on him contentedly, And wait with patience. 5 Fret not thy self, though wicked men May prosper for a while: Nor envy thou their happiness, Though all things seem to smile. 6 For workers of iniquity, The Lord shall soon destroy: But they that wait upon the Lord, Shall long the land enjoy. 7 Wait but a while, and thou no more These wicked men shalt see: Their houses and their mansion seats, Shall quite forgotten be. 8 But they that meek and humble are, Shall in the land abide: And shall with peace and plenty both, Be fill'd and satisfi'd. 9 The wicked plot against the just; Their teeth in rage they whet: But God derides them; for he sees Their day of vengeance set. 10 They draw their swords and bend their bows Against the good and just: Their bows shall burst, and all their swords, Into their hearts be thrust. 11 A little that a righteous man, Doth in this world possess, Excels the large estates of those, That live in wickedness. 12 The Lord will break the sinners arms, But righteous men maintains: An everlasting heritage, For upright men remains. 13 They never shall ashamed be, When evil days betide: And in a time of scarcity, They shall be satisfy'd. 14 But such as fight against the Lord, He quickly will destroy, As fat of lambs on altars burnt, In smoak consumes away. 15 The wicked man doth borrow much, And never pays again: But righteous men will freely give, The needy to sustain. 16 For from the blessing of the Lord, Their plenty they derive: And they that cursed are of him, Can never hope to thrive. 17 The Lord doth guide the good mans steps, And in his way delight: He keeps him so, that though he falls, He shall not perish quite. 18 I have been young, and now am old, And never yet did see, The children of the merciful, Reduc'd to beggery. 19 He freely lends, and to his seed, The Lord will it restore: Then cease from evil, and do good, And dwell for evermore. 20 For to his saints the righteous Lord, Will sure possessions give: But branches of a wicked root, Permits not long to live. 21 A righteous man his tongue doth rule, And with discretion guide: The law of God is in his heart, His steps shall never slide. 22 Though wicked men the good man watch, And seek his life for spite: God will not leave him in their hands, But judge and do him right. 23 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, And shortly thou shalt see, He will cut off the wicked man, But bless and prosper thee. 24 I saw the wicked in great power, And spread like lawrels green: But suddenly he past away, And could no more be seen. 25 Mark the upright and perfect man; His end is peace and joy: But sad shall be the sinners end, For God shall them destroy. 26 But the salvation of the just, Doth from the Lord proceed: For he in trouble is their help, And strength in time of need. 27 And still against the wicked race, He will be their defence, Because in him, and him alone, They put their confidence. Psalm XXXVIII. 1 O Lord, correct me not in wrath, Let fury burn no more: For fast in me thine arrows stick, Thy hand doth press me sore. 2 Thine anger makes my flesh to quake, No soundness is therein: Nor in my bones is any rest, By reason of my sin. 3 My sins have overwhelmed me, And prest me to the ground: My flesh is fill'd with noisome sores, And many a bruise and wound. 4 With sorrow I am bowed down; All day I weep and mourn: My loins are full of loathsome boils, Most grievous to be born. 5 I feeble am, and broken sore, While for my sins I smart: I cannot but cry out and roar, For anguish of my heart. 6 But, Lord, my grief is known to thee; Thou hearest every groan: My heart doth pant, my strength doth fail My very sight is gone. 7 My friends and lovers stand aloof, My kinsmen keep away: And they that seek my life lay snares, And mischiefs all the day. 8 And all this while I patient was, And not a word did make: As if I had been deaf and dumb, I did no notice take. 9 Because I hope in thee, O Lord, To hear me when I call; And not permit mine enemies, To triumph at my fall. 10 For, Lord; I ready am to sink; My ruin near I see, I will therefore confess my faults, And tell my sins to thee. 11 My enemies lively are and strong, And numerous too are grown: And hate me most implacably, For goodness sake alone. 12 Then leave me not, O Lord my God, In such a time of need: Thou art my Lord and Saviour, O succour me with speed. Psalm XXXIX. 1 I said, I would most watchful be, To keep my tongue from sin: And while the wicked are in sight, My lips to bridle in: 2 I spake nor good nor bad a while; But then my grief increast: My heart with musing waxed hot, And burned in my breast. 3 At last I spake, and thus began, Lord, make me know my end: And tell the measure of my days, How far it will extend. 4 An hand breadth hast thou made my days, As nothing in thy sight: Such at his best estate is man, So vain a thing and light. 5 His life is nothing but a dream; He heaps up wealth in vain: And cannot tell who shall enjoy, The fruit of all his pain. 6 But thou, O Lord, art all my hope; O Lord, forgive me then: And make me not a laughing stock, To leud and foolish men. 7 I did not murmur at thy hand, Nor will of wrong complain: But since I am almost consum'd, Lord, take it off again. 8 When thou for sin dost man correct, What is his beauty then? As garments fair by moth consum'd, Such are the best of Men. 9 Then hear me, and regard my tears, For, Lord, I sojourn here, And am a stranger in the earth, As all my fathers were. 10 O spare me then a little space, And strength to me restore; Before I go away from hence, And shall be seen no more. Psalm XL. 1 I sought thee Lord from time to time, And waited patiently: At last to me he did incline, And listned to my cry. 2 He rais'd me from an horrid pit, From deep and miry clay: And set my feet upon a rock, In firm and steddy way. 3 He put new songs into my mouth, Of praise to God most high: That many may observe and fear, And on the Lord rely. 4 O blessed is that man indeed, Whose trust is in the Lord: But haughty men respecteth not, Nor lyars doth regard. 5 How many are thy wonders, Lord, Which thou for us hast wrought: Thy glorious mercies and designs, Surpass our very thought. 6 When sacrifice and offerings, Our sins could not remove; Thou didst prepare a sacrifice, The Lord from heaven above. 7 In manner of a servant mean, Or one whose ears are bor'd, He came and said, lo here I am, To do thy will, O Lord. 8 Thy law is all within my heart, And it perform I will, And what thy book foretold of me, Entirely will fulfil. 9 These wonders of thy mercy, Lord, To preach [illeg.] did not spare: Nor in the congregations great, Thy promise to declare. 10 Now think upon me, O my God, And save me as before: And let thy mercy and thy truth, Preserve me evermore. 11 My sins surround, and seize me so, To look to heaven I dread: My heart doth fail; for they are more Than hairs upon my head. 12 O save and help me then with speed, And bring them all to nought, Whose cruel and malicious hearts, Have my destruction sought. 13 Let ruine be the scorners lot; But such as seek thy face, Let them forever praise thy name, And magnifie thy grace. 14 My comfort is, thou think'st on me, When I am poor and low: Then in my trouble, O my God, To help me be not slow. Psalm XLI. 1 The man is blest that lays to heart, The sufferings of the poor: For when afflictions him befal, The Lord will him restore. 2 The Lord in safety will preserve, And bless him in the land: And he will not deliver him Into his enemies hand. 3 When he lies sick, and almost spent, By force of his disease, And on his bed can take no rest, The Lord will send him ease. 4 In my distress I cry'd, and said, Have mercy, Lord, on me: And heal my soul which troubled is, That I offended thee. 5 Mine enemies speak ill of me, And wish in heart the same: When will he die, that we may see The ruine of his name? 6 They come indeed to visit me, And seem with me to moan: But mischief plot, and tell it out, As soon as they are gone. 7 They whisper thus among themselves, His sickness is so fore, And he so weak, there is no fear Of ever rising more. 8 Yea ev'n mine own familiar friend, On whom I did rely, Who at my table daily sat, Became mine enemy. 9 But, Lord, in mercy raise me up, That I may them requite: And by that token I shall know, Thou dost in me delight. 10 And as in my integrity, Thou hast supported me: So by thy favour evermore, I shall preserved be. 11 Blest be the God of Israel, Let us for ever sing: And every creature say amen, Amen, thou heavenly King. Psalm XLII. 1 As thirsting heart doth pant and long The water-brooks to see: So is my soul inflam'd with thirst, And pants, O Lord for thee. 2 It thirsts for God, the living God, Nor can his absence bear: But still cries out, O when shall I, Before his face appear? 3 My tears have been my daily food, To hear blasphemers cry, O where is now that God of thine, On whom thou didst rely? 4 My soul doth melt, to call to mind, What throngs on holy days, Unto the temple follow'd me, With psalms and songs of praise. 5 But why art thou cast down, my soul, And why so much in pain? Hope still in God: for I shall praise My Saviour once again. 6 O God my soul is troubled sore, Yet will I think on thee, From Jordan and from Hermon hill, Where I am forc'd to flee. 7 The floods beneath and from above, To swallow me agree: Thy mighty billows and thy waves. Are all gone over me. 8 Yet still the Lord from day to day, His mercy will extend: And I to him will every night, Both praise and prayer send. 9 Why, O my rock, I then will say, Hast thou forgot me so? And why opprest by enemies, Do I lamenting go? 10 Their vile reproaches wound my heart, And pierce me like a sword: While every day I hear them say, Where now is God thy Lord. 11 But why art thou cast down, my soul, And why so much in pain? Hope still in God: for I shall praise My Saviour once again. Psalm XLIII. 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, Against the wicked race: From cruel and deceitful men, Defend me by thy grace. 2 For of my strength thou art the God, Why put't thou me away? And why do I oppressed go, And mourning all the day? 3 Send forth, O Lord thy light and truth, And let them lead me still, Till I unto thy temple come, And to thy holy hill. 4 Then will I to thine altar go, And there triumphing sing, With harp in hand thy praises high, O God my God and King. 5 Why art thou then cast down, my soul; And why so much in pain? Hope still in God; for I shall praise My Saviour once again. Psalm XLIV. 1 Our ears have often heard, O God; Our fathers have us told, What wonders in their days were done, And in the times of old. 2 How thou didst drive the heathen out, With all their wicked race: And didst thy chosen people take, And plant them in their place. 3 It was not by their sword, nor arm, That they subdu'd the land: But by thy favour, Lord, alone, And by thy mighty hand. 4 Command deliverance then, O God, From all our enemies: Then shall we push and tread them down, That up against us rise. 5 Nor sword, nor bow, but thou alone Hast brought our foes to shame: In thee we all the day will boast, And ever praise thy name. 6 But now thou seem'st to cast us off; Our armies prosper not: We flee before our enemies, And they our spoils have got. 7 As sheep for slaughter we are made, And scattered here and there: We are become the worst of slaves, For whom no buyers care. 8 A meer reproach and scorn we are, To neighbours round about: A proverb and a laughing stock, To all the common rout. 9 This makes me blush continually, And hide my face for shame: Because the cruel enemy, Blasphemes thy holy name. 10 But though all this we have endur'd, We did not thee forsake: Nor casting off thy covenant, A new religion take. 11 We have not turned from thy ways, Nor was our heart unsound: Though at the gates of death we were, And trodden to the ground. 12 Ev'n then we did not thee forget, Nor to an idol bow: Thou Lord that know'st the hearts of all, Thou know'st it to be so. 13 Yea, Lord, we choose to suffer death, And would not thee deny: Although like sheep we all day long, Appointed were to die. 14 Awake then, Lord, why sleepest thou Arise and save, we pray: From our affliction and distress, Why turnest thou away? 15 For we are bow'd even to the dust, And to the earth we cleave: Arise, and from this bondage great, In mercy us relieve. Psalm XLV. 1 Of Christ that glorious King, My heart shall now endite: My tongue shall imitate the pen Of those that nimbly write. 2 Thou fairest of all men, Thy lips with grace abound: Thou art the blessed of the Lord, With endless glory crown'd. 3 Gird on thy sword, O prince, And in majestick state, Ride forth against thine enemies, And still be fortunate. 4 Let meekness, truth and right, Adorn thy peaceful reign: But let thy terrors fall on them, That do thy power disdain. 5 With arrows prick the hearts Of them that are thy foes: Till they at last submit themselves, And thee no more oppose. 6 Thy throne, O Son of God, For ever shall endure: The scepter of thy kingdom, Lord, Is righteous, just and pure. 7 Thou lovest righteousness, And dost all sin detest: Hence God doth thee, with oyl of joy, Anoint above the rest. 8 From ivory palaces, When thou with joy dost come, Thy robes of myrrh and odours smell, Perfuming all the room. 9 Kings daughters there appear, And in a vest of gold, At thy right hand the queen doth stand, Most glorious to behold. 10 O princess most serene, Consider now thy place: Forget thy countrey and thy friends, And all thy fathers race. 11 This will engage the king, To love the still the more: For he is now thy head and Lord, And him thou must adore. 12 The Tyrians with their gifts, Shall come unto the king: And all the great ones of the earth, To him shall presents bring. 13 And thou in robes of gold, Within most richly wrought, And curiously embroidered, Shalt to the king be brought. 14 Thy maids of honour too, That follow thee shall come: And shall with joy admitted be, Into the presence room. 15 And thou who didst forsake Thy father and his land, Thou shalt have children of thine own, That shall the world command. 16 This nuptial song of joy, I will for ever sing, And ages shall commemorate, This great and glorious King. Psalm XLVI. 1 God is our refuge and defence, The strength whereby we stand: In all our trouble and distress, His help is still at hand. 2 Therefore we will not be afraid, Though the earth removed be: And mighty hills be overturn'd, And cast into the sea. 3 Yea though the oceans troubled waves, Such dreadful roarings make; That at the very sound thereof, The strongest mountains quake. 4 For Sion with her pleasant streams, Shall safety still enjoy: The Lord in her will help her soon, That nothing shall annoy. 5 When heathens rag'd, his thundring voice, Did make them melt away. The Lord of hosts is on our side, And Jacob's God our stay. 6 Come then, ye people, and behold, The mighty works of God: What desolations he hath made, In all the earth abroad. 7 'Tis he that makes the wars to cease, In countries far and near: He burns the chariot in the fire, And breaks the bow and spear. 8 Be still, says he, and surely know, Like me there is no God: And that I will exalted be, In all the world abroad. 9 This mighty Lord, the Lord of hosts, Is he whom we adore: The God of Jacob is our help, And refuge evermore. Psalm XLVII. 1 O clap your hands, and shout to God To him triumphing sing: For he is Lord of all the earth, The great and dreadful King. 2 'Tis he that makes our enemies yield, And stoop to our command; 'Tis he that chose our heritage, That sweet and pleasant land. 3 With found of trumpets and with shouts, Our Sion hill doth ring: Sing praises to our God, they cry, Sing praises to our King. 4 For God is King of all the earth, Sing praises then with skill: He rules the heathen from his throne, Upon his holy hill. 5 To him, the God of Abraham, All kings shall homage pay: For all the powers on earth are his, And they shall him obey. Psalm XLVIII. 1 Great is the Lord, and to be prais'd, In great and high degree: In Sion his most holy hill, Let him exalted be. 2 The joy and beauty of the earth, Mount Sion we may count: And David's City on the north Of that most holy mount. 3 The Lord within her palaces, Is for a refuge known: Great Princes did against her come, But quickly they were gone. 4 They saw and were astonished, They hasted back again: And like a woman in her pangs, Were seiz'd with fear and pain. 5 Thy terrors fell upon them so, That they dispers'd and fled, As Tarsis ships by eastern winds Are broke and scattered. 6 That Sion shall preserved be, We often have been told: But now our eyes have seen it done, As we have heard of old. 7 Within thy holy temple, Lord, Thy mercies we rehearse: But thy renown is spread abroad, Throughout the universe. 8 The righteous acts of thy right hand Let Sion celebrate: And all that dwell in Judah's land, Thy mighty works relate. 9 Go round about this Sion hill, Her lofty towers tell: Observe her stately palaces, And mark her bulwarks well. 10 That you may tell the age to come, This is our God and guide: And that he shall be ever so, While life and breath abide. Psalm XLIX. 1 Regard my words ye people all; Throughout the world that dwell: Both high and low, both rich and poor, Attend and listen well. 2 My meditation and my song, Of deepest wisdom are: My parables and sayings dark, On harp I will declare. 3 Why should I fear, when age shall come, Those days that evil be: And death it self the fruit of sin, Supplant and compass me? 4 No man indeed with all his wealth, His brother can redeem: Nor can to God by any means, A ransom pay for him. 5 But when the souls redemption ceas'd, And paid by none could be; He paid it, who for ever lives, Nor could corruption see. 6 We see, both wise and foolish men, Are dying every day: And as they die they leave their wealth, For others to enjoy. 7 They vainly think, their mansion seats, For ever shall endure: And by their names they call their lands, As if they were secure. 8 But man, at first in honour set, Continued not a day: And hence like beasts his mortal race Must perish and decay. 9 This way of theirs their folly is, Yet their posterity, Their sayings and imprudent ways, Commend and justifie. 10 Death shall devour then, when like sheep They shall be laid in grave: But in the morn the upright man, Shall the dominion have. 11 The grave their beauty shall consume; But from its power and bands: The Lord my God will me redeem, And take into his hands. 12 Then envy not to see a man, Become exceeding rich: Nor when his house in honour grows, Unto the highest pitch. 13 For when he dies, his pomp and wealth, Behind him leave he must: Nor shall his glory after him, Descend into the dust. 14 Though whilst he liv'd, he blest his soul, (And men will praise the still, When of thy self thou makest much, And dost enjoy thy fill. 15 Yet shall he to his fathers go, No more the light to see: Thus man in honour, but unwise, How like a beast is he! Psalm L. 1 The mighty God hath spoke, To all both far and near: And all the earth from east to west, Hath summon'd to appear. 2 From Sions beauteous hill, His lightnings forth shall break: Our God will come, and thus to all, In fire and tempests speak. 3 He to the heavens will call, And to the earth below: That, how he will his people judge, They all may hear and know. 4 Assemble ye to me My saints, it shall be said; Who have a covenant with me, By sacrifices made. 5 The heavens shall then declare, How just his judgment is: For God himself will be the judge, Who cannot judge amiss. 6 Hear me, O Israel, And I will testifie: I am thy only God and Lord; There is none else but I. 7 I will not thee reprove. For offerings made by fire: 'Tis not thy daily sacrifice, That I so much desire. 8 No bullock will I take, Nor yet hee goat of thine: The cattle on a thousand hills, And forrests all are mine. 9 The fowls on mountains high To me are throughly known: And all wild beasts about the fields, Belong to me alone. 10 Although I hungry were, I would not tell it thee: The world and all that is therein, Of right belongs to me. 11 That I eat flesh of bulls, Art thou so vain to think? Or that I any pleasure take, The blood of goats to drink? 12 The sacrifice of praise, Is that the Lord requires: To pay those vows to God most high, Is what he most desires. 13 And then if troubles come, And thou to me shalt cry: I will thee save, and thou my name Shalt praise and glorifie. 14 But to the wicked man, My laws how dar'st thou teach? Or what hast thou, saith God, to do, My covenant to preach? 15 Who dost my word despise, And my instructions hate; And with adulterers and thieves, Thy self associate. 16 Thy mouth to lying words, And slanders thou dost use: To rail against thy brother dear, And mother's son abuse. 17 Thou thought'st me like thy self, Because I held my peace: But I'll convince thee of thy crimes, And prove them to thy face. 18 Consider this, all ye, No fear of God that have: Left I should you in pieces tear, And there be none to save. 19 The man that offers praise, Is he that honours me: And he that leads his life aright, Shall my salvation see. Psalm LI. 1 O lord, with mercy me behold, As thou on me were wont to look: And after thy compassions old, Lord blot my sins out of thy book. 2 O wash me from my crime so foul, And from this great iniquity: For I confess it from my soul, And think on it continually. 3 What I in secret did commit, Was open, Lord, unto thy sight: And if I be condemn'd for it, Thy judgment, Lord, is just and right. 4 In me who was conceiv'd in sin, The seeds of evil thou canst see: Much more this heinous fact of mine, Is manifest and known to thee. 5 I know, O Lord, thou dost command A conscience pure, and clear within: But I thy laws did understand, Yet did against my knowledge sin. 6 With hysop, Lord, me purifie, So shall I clean be in thy sight: Wash me, O Lord, and then shall I, Than snow it self become more white. 7 Let news of pardon me revive, My broken bones for joy will shout, When all my sins thou shalt forgive, And from thy book shalt blot them out 8 Create in me a heart most chast, Give me a spirit pure and right: Let me not from thy sight be cast, Nor take from me thy spirit quite. 9 Thy favour, Lord, again bestow, And with thy spirit set me free: Transgressors then thy ways shall know, And sinners shall be turn'd to thee. 10 Thou God of my salvation, Deliver me from guilt of blood; Then of thy mercies every one, My joyful tongue shall sing aloud. 11 Open my lips, O Lord, that so, My mouth thy praises may indite: For 'tis not sacrifice, I know, In which thou chiefly dost delight. 12 A broken heart is in thy sight, The best and sweetest sacrifice; A spirit broken and contrite, O God, thou never wilt despise. 13 Do good unto thy Sion still, Nor let her suffer for my sake: But still defend thy holy hill, And strongest walls about her make. 14 Burnt offerings then and sacrifice, Shall pleasing be to thee indeed; When what upon thine altar lies, Shall from an upright heart proceed. Psalm LII. 1 Why dost thou in thy mischief boast, O man of might and power? The goodness of the Lord to his, Endureth every hour. 2 Thy tongue is like a razor sharp, For mischief and deceit: Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying more than right. 3 Thou lovest all pernicious words, O thou deceitful tongue: But God shall surely thee destroy, And take thee hence e'er long. 4 The Lord shall pluck thee from the earth, And root thee wholly out: The righteous then shall wondring see, And thus at him shall flout. 5 Behold the man, that made not God His refuge and his stay: But trusted in his ill got wealth, And in his wicked way! 6 But like an olive in thy courts, whose leaf shall never fade: So in the mercy of the Lord, My hope is ever staid. 7 I will eternal praises sing, For this thy vengeance shown: All worship thee before thy saints, For all that thou hast done. Psalm LIII. 1 There is no God, the foolish man, Doth in his heart suppose: No wonder then, if in his life, All filthy lewdness flows. 2 The Lord look'd down from heaven to see, If any understood: But all were foul and filthy grown, And none whose life was good. 3 These workers of iniquity, Have they no sense at all: That eat God's people up as bread, And never on him call? 4 But God will fright and scatter them, That have beset thee round: And thou shalt put them all to shame, For God will them confound. 5 O when will he from Sion help, And back his captives bring; That Jacob may rejoyce in him, And Israel may sing? Psalm LIV. 1 Lord save me for thy holy name, And by thy strength defend: Regard the prayer that I make, And to my words attend. 2 For strangers now against me come, And such oppressors rise, As seek my life; and have not set The Lord before their eyes. 3 But God the Lord my helper is, With them that take my part: He will cut off mine enemies, And give them their desert. 4 Then will I praise thy name, O Lord, And freely sacrifice, Who savest me, and mak'st my foes, To fall before mine eyes. Psalm LV. 1 Give ear unto my prayer, O God, And listen to my moan: Attend to me in my complaint, And hear me when I groan. 2 Because mine enemies slander me, And wicked men oppress: And charge me most maliciously, With heinous wickedness. 3 My heart in me is pained sore, And pangs of death surround: Horror and trembling seize on me, And fear doth me confound. 4 O that I wings had like a dove, I said within my breast: Then would I from these troubles fly, That I may be at rest. 5 Then to some desart far remote, I would my self betake: And from the tempest and the storm, A swift escape would make. 6 Destroy them and divide their tongues, Who strife and mischief mean: And in whose city nothing else, But violence is seen. 7 Mischief and sorrow night and day, Her cursed walls contain: Dissembling, fraud, and wickedness, In all her streets remain. 8 For had an enemy slander'd me, It might have been endur'd: And had it been an open foe, I had my self secur'd, 9 But it was thou, my bosom friend, Whom I rely'd upon: With whom I to the house of God, With joy had often gone. 10 Let death upon such traitors seize, And send them quick to hell, For nothing else but wickedness, Doth in their houses dwell. 11 But I upon the Lord will call, And he will me defend: Evening and morning, and at noon, My prayer shall ascend. 12 The Lord will keep my soul in peace, When wars with me they make: And mine will be the strongest side, When God my part doth take. 13 The Lord will hear, and plague them soon, The Lord that was of old: Though they, because they see no change, In wickedness are bold. 14 This spiteful man upon me fell, Who liv'd in amity: He broke his covenant with me, And dealt perfidiously. 15 Smoother than butter were his words, But war was his intent: Softer than oyl his speeches were, Yet blood and mischief meant. 16 O cast thy burden on the Lord, And he shall thee sustain: And when they seek to cast thee down, Their labour shall be vain. 17 But God shall cast into the pit, The bloody and unjust: They shall not live out half their days, But I in thee will trust. Psalm LVI. 1 Be merciful to me, O God, For man would me devour: He fighteth with me every day, And doth oppress me sore. 2 They daily seek to swallow me, For many with me fight: But I will trust in thee, O Lord, Amidst my greatest fright. 3 Thou gav'st me cause to praise thy word; It is, O Lord from thee: In thee I trust, and will not fear, What flesh can do to me. 4 They wrest my words; and mischief plot, Against me every day: They meet, and slily mark my steps, How they their snares may lay. 5 But shall these wicked workers scape, In their iniquities? With vengeance cast them down, O God, That they may never rise. 6 My wandrings thou hast counted up, And every step I took: My tears are in thy bottle put, And written in thy book. 7 When I begin to cry to thee, Mine enemies turn and flee: By this I know assuredly, The Lord doth stand for me. 8 Thy word, thy word, Lord, I will praise, It is for ever true: In God I Trust, and will not fear What Man to me can do. 9 Thy Vows, O God upon me are, Which I to Thee have made: And all the Praises I have vow'd, Shall be most surely paid. 10 For thou hast sav'd my Soul from death, Lord keep me as before; That I may live to serve thee here, And praise thee evermore. Psalm LVII. 1 Be Merciful to me, O Lord, Be Merciful to me, For still in my Calamities, My Soul doth trust in thee. 2 Until these Storms be overpast, Lord hide me with thy wing: For unto thee; O Lord, I cry, Who can'st do every thing, 3 From Heaven send and rescue me From him that would devour: O shew thy mercy and thy truth, And save me from their power. 4 With firebrands, and with Lyons fierce My Soul doth ly, O Lord: Whose teeth like spears and arrows are, And tongue is like a sword. 6 But, Lord, be thou exalted still, Above the heavens high: And over all the earth abroad Make known thy majesty. 6 They laid a net to catch my feet, And me almost ensnar'd: But fell at last into the pit, Which they for me prepar'd. 7 To sing and magnifie thy name, My heart is fixt and bent; Betimes I will awake and praise with voice and instrument. 8 Among thy chosen people, Lord, I will exalt thy fame: And in the Nations round about Sing praises to thy name. 9 Thy truth and mercy famous are, Unto the clouds and skies: Yea far above the heavens and earth, Thy glory shall arise. Psalm LVIII. 1 Are your determinations just, All ye in courts that sit? Or ye that causes hear and judge, Do ye no wrong commit? 2 Yea rather in your hearts and minds, You wrong and mischief frame: And then by acts of violence, Your hands perform the same. 3 The wicked from the very womb Enclined are to sin: The seeds of falshood and of lies In infancy begin. 4 To serpents, or the adder deaf, We may them well compare: That stops her ear, nor will the voice, Of skilful charmers hear. 5 These furious lions teeth and jaws, Lord break them with thy stroke: Let all their hearts like water melt, And let their darts be broke. 6 As snails are melted and dissolv'd, So let them perish quite: And all their plots untimely prove, And never see the light. 7 As sudden flames, when thorns are burnt Or swift as whirlwinds drive: So let thy speedy vengeance seize, And take them hence alive. 8 The righteous, when this vengeance comes Shall much rejoyce to see't: And in the blood of wicked men, The just shall wash his feet. 9 And all shall say, for righteous men There is a sure reward: There is a judge, who in the earth Doth all mens works regard. Psalm LIX. 1 Lord save me from mine enemies, That up against me rise: Defend me from those bloody men, That wicked works devise. 2 For see, O Lord, they lie in wait, The mighty men combine: They run and plot against my life, And for no fault of mine. 3 Awake, and help, thou Lord of hosts; O Israel's God awake: Visit these heathens, and of them, Assured vengeance take. 4 By night, like dogs, they bark about The city every where: They belch out sharp and cruel words; For who, say they, can hear? 5 But thou, O Lord shalt laugh at them, And make of them a sport: And I upon thy strength will wait, For thou art my support. 6 Thou, who the God of mercy art, With mercy me prevent: And let me on mine enemies, Behold my hearts content. 7 Let them not all at once be slain, Let men forget it soon: But scatter them, O Lord our shield, And bring their power down. 8 For all their proud and wicked words, Lord, let them all be caught: And for their cursing and their lies, Wherewith their mouths are fraught. 9 Consume in wrath, consume them so, That all may understand, That he is Lord of all the earth, Who rules in Jacob's Land. 10 As hungry dogs in evenings howl, The city round about: So let them wander for their meat, And grudge to go without. 11 But I thy power and mercy both, Betimes will magnifie: Who art my refuge and defence, In my calamity, 12 To thee, O Lord, who art my strength, I will rejoyce and sing: Thou art the God, from whom my help, And all my comforts spring. Psalm LX. 1 O God thou hast rejected us, And scattered us abroad: Thou hast been long displeas'd with us, Now turn to us, O God. 2 The earth to tremble thou didst make, And it in pieces tear: O heal the breaches thou hast made, For still it quakes for fear. 3 Most heavy judgments thou hast shew'd, Before thy peoples sight: And mad'st us drink of such a cup, That us astonisht quite. 4 But thou a banner hast displaid, For them that fear thy name: Now hear, and for thy promise sake, Defend and save the same. 5 What God hath from his temple spoke, I now rejoyce to see: For Shechem now and Succoth vale, Are both possest by me. 6 Both Gilead and Manasseh too, Are now become my own: Strong Ephraim with Iudah's tribe, To which belongs the crown. 7 Proud Moab shall my washpot be. On Edom I will tread: And over the Philistines land, In triumph will proceed. 8 But who will Edom's city strong, Enable me to take? Lord, wilt not thou, who heretofore, Our armies didst forsake? 9 O help us in our troubles, Lord; In man there is no trust: But we through thee shall valiant be, And tread our foes to dust. Psalm LXI. 1 Lord hear my people and regard; From lands remote I cry: I faint, O lead me to the rock, That higher is than I. 1 For thou hast been my strong defence, And tower from my foes: Thy temple, Lord, and mercy seat, Shall be my safe repose. 3 The vows, O God, that I have made, Unto thy hearing came: Thou gavest me the heritage, Of those that fear thy name. 4 To ages Lord preserve the king, Before thee long to dwell: And let thy mercy and thy truth, Defend and keep him well. 5 So will I praise for ever sing, To thy most holy name: And daily make my vows to thee, And will perform the same. Psalm LXII. 1 My soul on God alone doth wait; From him my comforts are: My rock my saviour and defence, I will not greatly fear. 2 How long will ye on mischief muse? Ye shall most surely fall: For as a tottering fence ye are, And like a bowing wall. 3 They plot to cast me from my throne, Dissembling is their art: For while they bless me with their mouth, They curse me in their heart. 4 But wait, my soul, on God alone, To him I look for all: My rock, my saviour, and defence; And I shall never fall. 5 God is my strength, my song, my rock, And my defence secure: Let all men trust and pray to him, Who is a refuge sure. 6 Mean men are vain, and great men too, Although they promise more: Weigh them, and both are vanity, The rich as well as poor. 7 By robbing and oppressing men, Desire not rich to grow: Nor set your hearts upon your goods, Though wealth and riches flow. 8 This lesson more than once I learn'd From God's most holy Word: All power both in Heaven and Earth Belongs unto the Lord. 9 And that from thee alone, O Lord, All mercy doth proceed: For thou rewardest every man, According to his deed. Psalm LXIII. 1 O God my God, to seek to thee, I early will arise: I thirst for thee, and nothing else, Can my desire suffice. 2 As in a dry and thirsty land, I long to see thy face: As I have seen thee heretofore, In thy most holy place. 3 Because thy favour life it self, In sweetness doth surpass: I will both pray and praise thy name, As long as life shall last. 4 With marrow, and with fatness sweet, Thou entertainest me: Therefore will I with joyful lips, Sing praise, O Lord to thee. 5 To think on thee upon my bed, So great delight I take; That every night I meditate, As soon as I awake. 6 Because thou hast delivered me, In troubles heretofore: I in the shadow of thy wings, Will triumph evermore. 7 My soul pursues thee with her cries; Uphold me with thy power: But let them fall into the pit, That would my soul devour. 8 They all shall perish by the sword, And lie unburied, Till foxes and such beasts of prey, Have on their bodies fed. 9 Then shall the king in God rejoyce, And all that fear thy name: But wicked men, that trust in lies, Shall stop their mouths for shame, Psalm LXIV. 1 Attend, O Lord, to my complaint, And prayer that I make: My life for fear of enemies To thy protection take. 2 From secret plots of wicked men, Be thou my hiding place: And from the insurrections Of this ungodly race. 3 Whose words are sharper than a sword, And tongues like bows are bent: To shoot their darts even bitter words Against the innocent. 4 For secretly they take their aim, At those that perfect are: And suddenly against the just They shoot and do not fear. 5 In evil matters and designs They are extremely bold: They talk of laying snares, and say What Eye shall us behold? 6 They search and study how to bring Their wicked plots about: And no contrivance is so deep, But they will find it out. 7 But God will shoot an Arrow soon, And sorely wound them all: And make their own malicious tongues Upon themselves to fall. 8 Then all that see shall flee for fear, And shall Gods work declare: For wisely they shall meditate How just his doings are. 9 The righteous shall in God rejoice, And trust in him alone: And upright men shall make their boast Of all that he has done. Psalm LXV. 1 Praise waits for thee in Sion, Lord, And we our vows will pay: All flesh on earth shall come to thee, Who hearest them that pray. 2 Our Sins, O God, we must confess, Have too prevailing been: But let them all be wash'd away, And never more be seen. 3 O blest is he, whom thou dost choose Within thy Courts to dwell: For with the goodness of thy house He shall be filled well. 4 Thy dreadful judgments we have seen, And wonders of thy hand; O Saviour, who art the hope Of all by Sea and land. 5 Who by his power has fixed fast The hills and mountains strong: Who stills the raging of the Waves, And tumults of the throng. 6 The utmost parts of all the earth With joy thy wonders see: And all the world from East to West Rejoice and Sing to thee. 7 Thou visitest the thirsty earth, From heaven thy waters flow: Such preparation thou hast made To make the Corn to grow. 8 Her ridges thou dost water well, And furrows fill with rain: Thy showers mollify the clods, And make it spring amain. 9 With goodness thou hast crown'd the year, Thy clouds much fatness yield: The pastures and the hills rejoice In wilderness and field. 10 With flocks the pastures clothed are, With corn the vales below: They shout for joy, and sing to thee, From whom these blessings flow. Psalm LXVI. 1 Sing to the Lord, ye nations all, With sweet and joyful sound: Sing forth the honour of his name, And make his praise renown'd. 2 Say unto him, in all thy works, How dreadful, Lord, art thou? For through the greatness of thy power, Thy foes to thee shall bow. 3 Yea all the earth shall worship thee, And thus thy praise declare, Come, see the mighty works of God, How terrible they are. 4 He turn'd the channels of the sea To firm and beaten ways: We passed through the flood on foot, And there we sung his praise. 5 He by his power forever rules, His eyes the world behold: Then let not the rebellious men Grow insolent and bold. 6 O bless and magnifie our God, Sing praise, ye people all, Who suffers not our life to fade. Nor yet our feet to fall. 7 As silver thou hast proved us, On us thy net was thrown: And with a load of misery, Our loins were bowed down. 8 Men rode upon our heads: and we Through fire and water past: But thou into a wealthy place Didst bring us out at last. 9 Therefore my offerings and my vows, Shall in thy house be paid, Which in the day of my distress, My lips to thee have made. 10 The best of all my flocks and herds, I will present to thee: The choicest bullocks, goats, and rams My sacrifice shall be. 11 Come near to me, I then will say, All ye the Lord that fear: And what he for my soul has done, I will to you declare. 12 To him my tongue did cry aloud, And did extol his name: And had my heart regarded sin, He had not heard the same. 13 But surely God has heard my prayer, And granted my request: O let this good and gracious God, For evermore be blest. Psalm LXVII. 1 Have mercy on us, Lord; And shew thy grace divine: Thy blessing on thy people send, And cause thy face to shine. 2 That all the earth abroad, Thy way may know and see: And all the nations may confess No Saviour but thee. 3 Let people praise thy name, The people all about: And all the nations every where, For joy triumph and shout. 4 For thou, O Lord, wilt judge, The people righteously: And rule the kingdoms of the earth, With truth and equity. 5 Let people praise thy name, The people all about: Then shall thy blessings fill the earth, And make it yield her fruit. 6 Our God the only God, Whose chosen flock we are, Shall bless us so, that all the world Shall learn his name to fear. Psalm LXVIII. 1 Let God arise, and let his foes Be scattered out of sight: And every one that hates the Lord, Betake themselves to flight. 2 As wax is melted by the fire, Or smoke dispers'd abroad: So let the wicked perish all Before the face of God. 3 But let the righteous men be glad, And mightily rejoyce: Sing praises to the Lord our God, Sing praise with heart and voice. 4 Before his presence come with joy, Extol his mighty fame: Who rides upon the heavens high, Jehovah is his name. 5 The father of the fatherless, And judge of widows case; Our God is he, who dwels above, In his most holy place. 6 He founder is of families, He sets the prisoner free: But punishes rebellious men With want and scarcity. 7 When thou didst march before thy fled Into the wilderness: And lead them forth into the land Which they were to possess. 8 The earth did shake, the heavens dropt, Yea Sinai quak'd for fear: Because the God, the mighty God Of Israel was there. 9 Then thou, O God, didst send a rain, That flow'd most plentuously, Refreshing thine inheritance, When it was parch'd and dry. 10 That in the barren wilderness Thy people might abide: For of thy goodness thou, O Lord, Did'st for the poor provide. 11 God gave the word, and multitudes Did sing our victories: Great kings of armies fled from us, And Women shar'd the prize. 12 Though for a time we were despis'd, And in the rubbish lay: No dove with gold and silver wings, Could shine more bright and gay. 13 When the Almighty scattered kings, So glorious then we were; The snow on top of Salmon hill, Did not more white appear. 14 The hill of God to Bashan hill May be compared well: Boast not ye mountains; for the Lord Will here for ever dwell. 15 Here twice ten thousand angels stand, Yea more than we can count: To guard the holy throne of God, As once on Sinai mount. 16 Triumphing o'er thy captive foes, O Christ, thou didst ascend: And hast for men received gifts, Yea for rebellious men. 17 That God the Lord might dwell in them; O bless his name, and say, Blest be the Lord, who loadeth us With mercies every day. 18 He is our Saviour and our God; His name we will advance, Who only from the gates of death, Can send deliverance. 19 But God shall wound the head of them, That are his stubborn foes: The hairy scalp of every one That on in trespass goes. 20 My people I will bring, said he, From Bashan once again: And lead them as in times of old, I led them through the main. 21 That thou maist dip thy foot in gore, Of such as thee withstood: And that thy dogs, that follow thee, May lick their very blood. 22 Thy goings in thy holy place, Thy people, Lord, have seen: Thy triumphs, O my God and king, How glorious they have been. 23 The singers first, the players next On instruments took place: The damsels with their timbrels too, Did this procession grace. 24 Then all the congregation join'd To bless the Lord most high, That from the stock of Jacob came, Or his posterity. 25 Judah and little Benjamin, With all their heads were there Of Zebulun and Naptali, The princes all appear. 26 Confirm, O God, thou God of power, The wonders thou hast wrought: That presents by the greatest kings, May to thy house be brought. 27 Rebuke the spearmen, great and small; And put them all to flight, Till they submit, and tribute bring, Who did in war delight. 28 To make their peace great princes then Shall come from Egypts land: And Ethiopia to our God, Shall quickly stretch her hand. 29 Sing to our God, ye kingdoms all; Before the Lord rejoyce: Who rides upon the heavens high, And thunders with his voice. 30 Ascribe all power to him alone, Who doth in heaven dwell: That excellent and glorious king, That rules in Israel. 31 The majesty of Jacob's God, His temple doth proclaim: 'Tis he that gives his people strength; O blessed be his name. Psalm LXIX. 1 Save me, O God; the waters rise, And I in mire sink down: The mighty floods surrounded me so, That I am overflown. 2 I weary am with crying out, My throat is hoarse and dry: My eyes do fail with looking up To God for remedy. 3 My enemies than the very hairs Upon my head are more: And what I never took from them, They forc'd me to restore. 4 But, Lord, to thee I will appeal, My innocence to clear: Before whose eyes my secret faults, And follies all appear. 5 Grant for my sake, O Lord of hosts, That none that wait on thee, May of their hope and confidence, Ashamed ever be. 6 Because I for thy sake alone, Reproach and shame have born: And to my brethren am become A mere contempt and scorn. 7 The zeal that to thy house I bore, Hath me to nothing brought: And I by such as thee blaspheme Am scorn'd and set at nought. 8 When I for grief did fast and weep, They did but scorn and mock: And when I did in sackcloth go, I was their laughing stock. 9 They that were sitting in the gate, At me reproaches flung: Yea songs of me about the town, The very drunkards sung. 10 But in an acceptable time, My prayer I will make: Hear then, and save me, O my God, For thy good promise sake. 11 Deliver me out of the mire, And me from sinking keep: Save me from them that hate my soul, And from the waters deep. 12 The water floods to swallow me, O Lord, do not permit: Nor let me sink into the deep, Nor fall into the pit. 13 O hear me for thy goodness sake; Turn, Lord, and me behold, According to thy wonted grace, And mercies manifold. 14 Hide not thy face when trouble comes, But hear me speedily: Redeem me from my enemies, And to my soul draw nigh. 15 My shame, dishonour, and reproach Are known, O Lord, to thee: And who my adversaries are, Thou dost observe and see. 16 Reproach and grief have broke my heart, And when I looked round, And sought for some to pity me, No comforter was found. 17 So spiteful were my enemies, For meat they gave me gall: And vinegar to quench my thirst, When I for drink did call. 18 Lord, let their table be their snare, A trap their plenty make: With blindness ever smite their eyes, And make their loins to shake. 19 Pour out thy fury on their heads, And seize them in their sin: Make all their houses desolate, And none to dwell therein. 20 For him whom thou hast smitten down, They persecute the more: And vex them with malicious words, Whom thou didst wound before. 21 O let them fall from sin to sin, Till mercy find no place: And blot them from the book of life, Among the wicked race. 22 But I am poor and sorrowful; Lord raise me up on high: That I in songs of thanks and praise, Thy name may magnifie. 23 For praises are such offerings, As best the Lord will please: No bullock that hath horns and hoofs, Can be compar'd to these. 24 At this the humble shall rejoyce, And all that seek the Lord; Who never scorns the prisoners cry, But doth the poor regard. 25 O let the heavens praise the Lord, The earth, and sea so deep: And every thing that moves therein; For he will Sion keep. 26 The Lord will Judah's cities build, And fill with men the same: His servants seed shall them possess, And they that love his name. Psalm LXX. 1 Save me, O Lord, with speed; Make hast to succour me: And let them all that seek my life, With shame confounded be. 2 Let them be turned back, That wish my hurt, O Lord: And they that make a mock of me, Let shame be their reward. 3 But let them all rejoyce, That thy salvation love: And let them say continually, All praise to God above 4 Make hast to me, O God, For I am poor and low: Thou art my help and faviour, Come Lord, and be not slow. Psalm LXXI. 1 Lord let me not be put to shame, Because I trust in thee: But as thou art a righteous God, O hear and rescue me. 2 Be thou my habitation strong, To which I may resort. Thy promise is to save me, Lord: Thou art my fence and fort. 3 Save me O Lord, from wicked hands, From cruel and unjust: For thou, O God ev'n from my youth, Hast been my hope and trust. 4 Both at my birth and ever since Thou hast upholden me: Therefore my praise continually, Of thee alone shall be. 5 Though many gaze and mock at me, Thou art my strength and stay: Therefore my mouth shall sing thy praise, And honour all the day. 6 When strength through age begins to fail, O Lord forsake me not: For secretly against my life, My foes consult and plot. 7 Pursue and take him now, say they, For God doth him forsake: Then be not far from me, O Lord, But hast my part to take. 8 These adversaries of my Soul, O Lord confound them quite: And let dishonour cover them, That in my hurt delight. 9 But I will hope continually, And praise thee more and more: All day I will declare thy Acts, And mercies heretofore. 10 Thy mercies, Lord, are numberless: I in thy strength will go, And tell the great and righteous acts Which thou alone canst do. 11 Lord, thou hast taught me from my youth, And I thy acts have told: Now leave me not, O Lord my God, When I am gray and old. 12 Till I unto the present age Thy mighty works have shown: That to the Ages yet to come Thy Power may be known. 13 Thy Judgments, Lord, are very high, And great thy doings are: For who is like to thee, O God, Or may with thee compare? 14 When I had sore Afflictions seen, The Lord did me revive: And from the jewels of the earth Hast brought me up alive. 15 Now comfort me on every side, And raise me higher yet: And I upon the Psaltery Thy Praises will repeat. 16 My harp shall sound, O holy one Of Israel, to thee My heart and tongue to thee shall sing, Who hast redeemed me. 17 And all day long thy justice tell, Who hast to ruin brought, And with confusion cover'd them, That my destruction sought. Psalm LXXII. 1 To Christ thy Son, that glorious King' Thy judgments, Lord, commit: That he, to rule thy people well, Upon his Throne may sit. 2 Then great and small shall peace enjoy, And justice shall abound: For he with right shall judge the poor, And tread oppressors down. 3 As long as sun and moon endure He shall be fear'd by all: And shall come down like showers of rain, On new mown grass that fall. 4 Good men shall flourish in his days, And peace shall have no end: From sea to sea throughout the world His kingdom shall extend. 5 The people of the wilderness Before his face shall bow: His enemies shall lick the dust Upon the earth below. 6 The kings of Tarsis, and the Isles To him shall presents bring: Sheba and Seba gifts shall send To this almighty King. 7 All kings and nations him shall serve, For he the poor shall save: And rescue them that are opprest, When they no helper have. 8 He shall redeem the poor from wrong, And do the needy right: And blood of innocents shall be Most precious in his sight. 9 Long shall he live; and men to him Shall gold of Sheba bring: All people for his Reign shall pray, And praises daily sing. 10 As when of Corn a handful sown Upon a mountains top, At last doth shake like Lebanon, And proves a mighty crop. 11 So from the City of this king, The people shall abound: And flourish like the spreading grass, That covers all the ground. 12 Like to the suns continual light Shall be his lasting fame: All Nations shall be blest in him, And all shall bless his name. 13 Blest be the God of Israel For he is God alone: By whose almighty power it is These wonders shall be done. 14 And let his great and glorious name Be prais'd continually: Until his glory fill the earth, Amen, Amen, we cry. 2. Metre. 1 To Christ that glorious son of thine, That mighty Lord, and king divine Thy laws and judgments, Lord, commit: To rule thy people righteously, And judge the poor with equity, That he upon his throne may sit. 2 On all his subjects high and low The blessings then of peace shall flow, And justice every where abound: For he with right shall judge the poor, And save the needy evermore; But crush oppressors to the ground. 3 As long as sun and moon endure, His kingdom shall be firm and sure, And his dominion ever stand: Nor shall his reign less welcom prove Than gentle showers from above, To new mown grass or thirsty land. 4 The just shall flourish in his reign, And peace for ever shall remain; From sea to sea his bounds shall go: The people of the wilderness His just dominion shall confess, And all his foes to him shall bow. 5 The kings of Tarsis and the Isles, shall with their presents court his smiles, Sheba and Seba gifts shall briug. Yea every king the world throughout, And all the nations round about, Shall serve this great and glorious king. 6 For he shall listen to the cry Of helpless men in misery, To do the poor and needy right; And save their lives from violence, Because the blood of innocents Shall still be precious in his sight. 7 Long time shall he the scepter hold, And presents of the finest gold From Sheba shall to him be sent. And people for his reign shall pray, And sing the praises every day Of his most righteous Government. 8 As corn upon a mountains top, That from a handful proves a crop, Whose fruit like Lebanon doth shake: So from the city of this king Great multitudes like grass shall spring, And every where increase shall make. 9 His glory like the sun shall be, As lasting and as bright as he: His name forever shall remain; All nations shall in him be blest, And him all nations shall confess, And thus shall bless his name again. 10 âO blest be Israels God alone, âBy whom all wondrous things are done, âAnd blessed be his glorious name: âTill with his praise the earth shall ring, âAmen, Amen, then let us sing, âAnd every creature do the same. Psalm LXXIII. 1 Sure God is good to Israel, To men of heart sincere: But as for me, my feet did slip, And nigh to falling were. 2 For I was envious, when I saw, The wicked prosper so: How free they are from deadly pangs, How stout and strong they go. 3 They often are from troubles free, When all are plagu'd beside; Which makes them hug and wrap themselves In violence and pride. 4 Their eyes with fat stand strutting out; They have what heart can crave: Corrupt they are; and wicked words Are all the talk they have. 5 They proudly of oppression boast, Yea with blasphemous talk, Their mouth against the heavens is set, And through the earth doth walk. 6 This makes good men reflect with tears, And much lament and grieve: That God regards the things below, They scarcely can believe. 7 See how the wicked tribe, said I, In riches thrive amain: Then surely I have cleans'd my heart, And wash'd my hands in vain. 8 For all day long I have endur'd Great plagues and sufferings: And every morning of my life, Some new affliction brings. 9 But if to speak at such a rate, O Lord, I should pretend: I know against thy children dear I deeply should offend. 10 When this I could not understand, Into thy house I went: And then the end of all these men, To me was evident. 11 For thou hast set these wicked men In slippery places all: And they that now are lifted up, Shall soon to ruin fall. 12 Thy terrors shall consume them all, And make them vanish quite: Much like a dream when one awakes, Or image of the night. 13 Thus was my heart perplexed sore, And grieved in my breast: I was almost as ignorant As if I were a beast. 14 But Lord I ever am with thee, And thou wilt hold me fast: And with thy counsel guide me safe To Glory at the last. 15 O who is there in heaven above, Like thee that I desire? Nor is there one in all the earth, But thee, that I require. 16 When both my flesh and heart shall fail, The Lord will me restore: For of my heart he is the strength, And portion evermore. 17 For they that are estrang'd from thee, Shall perish every one: Thou hast to ruin brought them all, That have a whoring gone. 18 But surely it is good for me, That I draw near to God: In him I trust that all his works, I shall declare abroad. Psalm LXXIV. 1 O God why hast thou cast us off? Wilt thou thine anger keep? And shall thy fury ever smoke Against thy pasture sheep? 2 Thy chosen flock redeem'd of old, No longer, Lord, forget: Thy heritage, and Sion hill, On which thy house is set. 3 Come, Lord, and see what wicked work Thine enemies have made: How they thy high and holy place, Have all in ruines laid. 4 Amidst thy Congregations, Lord, Thy enemies roar aloud: And as a sign of victory, Advance their banners proud. 5 By felling trees to build thy house Of old men got renown: But now the carved work at once, Is knock'd and chopped down. 6 Thy temple they have quite destroy'd, And set it on a flame: And say by all thy synagogues, They mean to do the same. 7 We see no signs, as we were wont, And prophet there is none, To tell how long 'tis like to be, E'er these sad times be gone. 8 How long shall they blaspheme thy name? What, will they never rest? Then keep not back thy hand, O Lord, But pluck it from thy breast. 9 The Lord to be his peoples king, In times of old was known: And him the only Saviour, All men on earth must own. 10 Thou by my strength did'st part the Sea, And break the dragons head: The people in the wilderness, Upon his carcass fed. 11 Thou did'st the flood and fountain cleave, And dry up mighty streams: The day is thine, the night is thine, The sun and all his beams. 12 In all the borders of the earth, Thy hand has set the bounds: Summer and winter thou hast made To go their wonted rounds. 13 Remember how thy enemies, Thy majesty defame: Consider how the foolish ones Blaspheme thy holy name. 14 Deliver not thy turtle dove To that ungodly throng: The congregation of the poor, Forget not over-long. 15 O think upon the covenant, For now thy enemies, In secret corners every where Their cruel plots devise. 16 O let them not that are opprest, Return from thee with shame: But let the poor and needy ones Have cause to praise thy name. 17 Arise, O Lord; plead thine own cause: Remember, Lord, and see, How every day the wicked man Derides and mocks at thee. 18 Forget not Lord their wicked words, And horrid blasphemy, The cry whereof into thine ears Ascends continually. Psalm LXXV. 1 To thee O God do we give thanks; To thee all praise is due: For thou art ever near to them, That do thy wonders shew. 2 God in due time will judge the world: The earth and all therein, Had not the Lord the pillars staid, Had quite dissolved been. 3 I said unto the foolish men, Deal not so foolishly: And to the wicked, be not proud, Nor lift your horns so high. 4 Forbear your high and haughty words, For when promotions fall, 'Tis not from east, nor west, nor south, But God disposes all. 5 He is the judge, by whom alone Such alterations come: He puts down one and setteth up Another in his room. 6 For of his red and mixed wine, His hand doth hold the cup: But keeps the dregs for wicked men, And they shall drink them up. 7 Therefore will I of Jacobs God, Forever sing the praise, Who loves to pull the wicked down, And righteous men to raise. Psalm LXXVI. 1 In Judah's land the Lord is known, His name in Israel: In Salem he has pitch'd his tent, And doth in Sion dwell. 2 For there the arrows of the bow Were broken by his hand: The shield, the sword, and battle too Are all at his command. 3 Thy power excells the mountains high; Thou spoil'st the men of might: The stout are cast into asleep, And found no hands to fiight. 4 At thy rebuke, O Jacob's God, When thou did'st interpose, Both horse and man were smitten dead; They slept and never rose. 5 Thou Lord, even thou art God alone, Whom all men ought to fear: And in thy sight, when thou art wrath, O Lord, who shall appear. 6 Thy judgments from the heaven were heard; Earth fear'd, and durst not speak, When thou to judgment did'st arise, To rescue all the meek. 7 Man's wroth shall to thy praise be turn'd; And what would overflow, Shall by thy power be so restrain'd, It shall no further go. 8 Vow then, and pay to God the Lord, And to this mighty king, Let all the nations round about, Their humble presents bring. 9 For he the lives of princes great, Can at his pleasure take: There is no king in all the earth, But he can make him quake. Psalm LXXVII. 1 To God I cry'd, to him alone, And he my voice did hear: I earnestly besought the Lord In my distress and fear. 2 All night I stretched forth my hands, And ceas'd not to grieve: My troubled and distressed mind No comfort could receive. 3 Although I thought upon the Lord, Yet found I no relief: All the night long I waking lay, And could not speak for grief. 4 I thought upon the ages past, And mus'd on former days: And in the night I call'd to mind My Psalms and Songs of praise. 5 And thus I reason'd with my self, In my distress and pain: Will God forever cast me off, And never smile again? 6 Are all his tender mercies gone, And will his promise fail? Has God forgotten to be kind, And will his wrath prevail? 7 But I reply'd, to reason thus, Is my infirmity: I will remember in times past, The hand of the most high. 8 The mighty signs and wonders all, That he perform'd of old: His works shall all be thought upon, And all his acts be told. 9 Thy way is in thy temple seen; Who may with thee compare: Whose wondrous works in every place, Thy mighty power declare. 10 Thou by thy mighty Arm, O Lord, Thy people did'st redeem: Jacob's and Joseph's sons of old, From bondage most extreme. 11 The waters saw thy power, O God, They saw and were afraid: The deep with all its mighty waves, Was troubled and dismaid. 12 The clouds did melt, the heavens roar'd, Thy arrows flew around: Thunders and lightnings fill'd the world, And shook the very ground. 13 Thy way, O God, was in the sea, Thy path in waters great, Where none did ever go before, Nor foot was ever set. 14 There didst thou lead thy people forth, Much like a flock of sheep: By Moses and by Aaron's hand, Thou didst them safely keep. Psalm LXXVIII. 1 Attend my people to my words, Give ear O Israel: To what I am about to say, Incline and listen well. 2 In parables I will declare, And sayings dark of old; Which by our fathers heretofore, Were to their children told. 3 We from the Ages yet to come, God's praise will not conceal: But all his power and wondrous works, To them we will reveal. 4 For he in Israel made a law, That father to the son, And so forth on from age to age, Should tell what God had done. 5 That they might learn their hope and trust In God alone to set: And that they might not break his laws, Nor mighty works forget. 6 Nor might their fathers imitate, Who stiff and stubborn were: Whose heart was not upright with God, Nor spirit was sincere. 7 The Ephraimites though arm'd with bows, In battel fled away: Because they kept not his commands, Nor would his laws obey. 8 For they forgot the mighty works He had in Egypt shown: And what he in their fathers sight, In Zoan field had done. 9 He brought them through the parted waves, Which stood on heaps upright: And led them with a cloud by day, And with a fire by night. 10 He in the desart clave the rocks, And made the waters flow: That they in floods came streaming down, As mighty rivers do. 11 And yet they did but sin the more, Provoking God most high: And tempted him by asking meat, Their lust to satisfie. 12 Yea they did these blasphemous words, Against the Lord express, Can God provide a feast for us, In such a wilderness? 13 He gave us water from the rock, And made the streams to flow: But can he give us bread and flesh For all this people too? 14 At this the anger of the Lord Was kindled to a flame: And soon upon his Israel A dreadful vengeance came. 15 Because they would not him believe, Nor in his mercy hope: Though he had made the clouds give way, And doors in heaven set ope. 16 He manna rain'd, and gave them corn Of heaven, most sweet and good: And mortal man most plenteously, Was fed with Angels food. 17 He caus'd the south-east wind to blow, And by his mighty power, He rained flesh as thick as dust, Or sand upon the shoar. 18 He let it fall about their tents, That they might eat their fill: So very man had his desire, And feasted at his will. 19 But while the meat was in their mouths, The plague from heaven fell; And swept away the choicest men That were in Israel. 20 Yet after this they sinned still, Nor would his works believe: For which he made them all their days To pine away and grieve. 21 When thus he plagu'd them for their sin, To seek him then they seem'd: Confessing that he was their rock, And had their lives redeem'd. 22 But all this while they flatter'd him, And did but feign and lie: They spoke him fair, but in their hearts There was no honesty. 23 Yet he in mercy spar'd them still, Nor did them all destroy: Yea oft his anger he restrain'd, And turn'd his wrath away. 24 For he consider'd with himself They were but mortal men: Or like the wind that passeth hence, And cometh not agen. 25 How often in the wilderness, Did they his spirit grieve? They turned back and tempted God, Nor would his power believe. 26 They thought not on his mighty hand, When he their lives did save: And wondrous signs in Egypt's land, And field of Zoan gave. 27 He turn'd their rivers into blood, That none thereof could drink: He sent most noisome flies and frogs, That made their land to stink. 28 Their crops by locusts were devour'd, And all their labour lost: Their vines by hailstones were destroy'd, And sycamores by frost. 29 By hail and fiery thunderbolts, Their flocks he did annoy: And in his wrath bad angels sent, The people to destroy. 30 He to his anger made a way, Nor did with life dispence: But man and beast delivered were Unto the pestilence. 31 He smote the first born every where, That came of Egypt's stock: And guided through the wilderness, His people like a flock. 32 He led them safely through the flood, No cause of fear they found: But by the seas returning waves, Their enemies were drown'd. 33 He led them to his holy place, Which his right hand had bought: This holy mount, from whence his arm Had cast the heathen out. 34 He gave them an inheritance, To every tribe their lot: And made them safe in tents to dwell; Yet they obey'd him not. 35 But like their fathers turned back, Nor faithful did abide: Much like to a deceitful bow, That carries quite aside. 36 For by their Altars on the hills, They did his anger try: And by their graven images, Provok'd his jealousie. 37 At this the Lord was very wroth, And loathed Israel: His tent in Shiloh he forsook, Where he was wont to dwell. 38 The Ark of God that was the strength, And glory of the land, Was taken and deliver'd up Into the enemies hand. 39 He gave his people to the sword, His chosen heritage: Young men were slain, and virgins were Depriv'd of marriage. 40 Yea priests were slain, and widows made No lamentation: At last the Lord awoke from sleep, To see what men had done. 41 He shouted like a Giant strong, When wine doth him inflame: And smote them on their hinder parts, To their perpetual shame. 42 The tents of Joseph he refus'd, Nor would in Ephraim dwell: But Judah chose; and Sion hill, The place he lov'd so well. 43 And there his holy temple set, And built it strong and high: Strong as the earth that never moves, But stands continually. 44 He took his servant David too From following the sheep, And Israel his chosen flock, Appointed him to keep. 45 So with a true and faithful heart, His flock he duly fed: And with a wise and skilful hand, His people governed. Psalm LXXIX. 1 See Lord how thy inheritance, The heathens all invade: Defile thy Temple, and in heaps Jerusalem have laid. 2 The bodies of thy servants dear, Of fowls are made the meat: The flesh of thy most precious saints Is left for beasts to eat. 3 Their blood like water they have shed About Jerusalem: Their carcases are cast abroad, And none to bury them. 4 Our neighbours have reproached us, And all about us scorn: But Lord how long wilt thou be wroth? Shall anger ever burn? 5 Upon the heathens pour thy wrath, That have not known thy name: And on the Kingdoms of the World That call not on the same. 6 For they have Jacob quite devour'd, And laid his dwelling wast: But do not thou remember, Lord, Our sins in ages past. 7 Prevent us with thy mercy soon, Who ready are to fall: Help, Lord, and for thy glorious name, Forgive and save us all. 8 Why should the heathen boasting say, Their God, now where is he? Lord make them see thy servants blood Shall be reveng'd by thee. 9 O hear the mournful sighs of them, That fast in prison lie: And save them by thy mighty power That are condemn'd to die. 10 Into their bosom sevenfold, Lord let it be repaid, That have upon thy holy name, Such vile reproaches laid. 11 So we that are thy pasture sheep, And chosen heritage, Will render thanks to thee, O Lord, And praise from age to age. Psalm LXXX. 1 Hear, mighty shepherd, who the flock Of Israel dost feed: Shine from between the Cherubims And help us at our need. 2 Stir up thy strength, and save us now, As when thine Ark did go, Follow'd by Ephraim, Benjamin, And by Manasseh too. 3 Lord turn us and we shall be safe; O cause thy face to shine: And be not angry at the prayer Of this poor flock of thine. 4 Our tears have been our meat and drink, That from our eyes did slide: Our neighbours strive among themselves, Who shall us most deride. 5 Turn us again, O God of hosts, And cause thy face to shine: Upon thy own inheritance, And save this flock of thine. 6 Thou hast a Vine from Egypt brought, And cast the heathen out: Thou didst both plant and make it grow, And fill the land about. 7 The hills were covered with her shade, Her boughs like cedars spred: And from the river to the sea, Her branches flourished. 8 Why hast thou then laid wast this vine, And broke her hedges down: That all that pass may pluck her grapes, As if they were their own. 9 The boar out of the forrest comes, Thy vineyard to destroy: And all the beasts about the fields, Thy pleasant plant annoy. 10 Return, O Lord, look down from heaven, Behold this wasted vine: Which thy right hand alone did plant, And nourish to be thine. 11 The branch which thou hast propped up, And strengthned for thine own, Is now, O Lord, at thy rebuke, Consum'd and broken down. 12 O let thy hand protect and keep Thy best beloved One, Whom thou hast promis'd to support, And to uphold his throne. 13 So will we never fall from thee, But ever worship give: Turn us again, O Lord of hosts, O smile and we shall live. Psalm LXXXI. 1 O sing aloud to God our strength, To Jacob's God rejoice: With timbrel harp and psaltery, Sing Psalms with pleasant voice. 2 As in new moons, and solemn feasts, Let trumpets now be blown: For this amongst the Israelites, An ancient law was known. 3 This was a statute ever since We were from Egypt led, Where we as strangers in the land, Had long continued. 4 From burdens I his shoulders took, His hands from bricks set free: In trouble thou didst call on me, And I delivered thee. 5 From heaven I did answer thee, By thunders from above: And at the brooks of Meribah, I did my people prove. 6 Hear then, and I will testifie, And bear my words in mind: No God but me thou shalt adore, Of any sort or kind. 7 I am thy God that from the land Of Egypt thee did save: Ope thy mouth wide, and I will fill, Thou shalt but ask and have. 8 But Israel would none of me, Nor would regard my voice: And so I left them to their lusts, And to enjoy their choice. 9 But O that Israel had obey'd, And in my ways had gone: Their enemies I had soon subdu'd, And conquer'd every one. 10 Haters of God should soon have stoop'd To his almighty power: But Israel should have remain'd In peace for evermore. 11 He also would have satisfi'd, His dear and chosen flock, With finest flower of the wheat, And honey from the rock. Psalm LXXXII. 1 Amidst the great and mighty ones, The Lord himself doth stand: For he is Judge among the gods, And princes of the land. 2 How long will ye unjustly judge, And favour men of might? Defend the poor and fatherless, And do the needy right. 3 They will not see nor understand, But blindly still go on: The strong foundations of the earth, Are out of order gone. 4 I said indeed that ye were Gods, And sons of the most high: But know ye are but mortal men, And shall like others die. 5 Arise, O God, and judge the earth, And save us all from wrong: For all the nations of the world, To thee alone belong. Psalm LXXXIII. 1 Hold not thy peace, O Lord my God, O sit not silently: For see, thine enemies tumults make, And lift their heads on high. 2 Against thy flock thy hidden ones, They thus consult and plot: Let's cut them off, and make the name Of Israel be forgot. 3 Against the Lord with one consent, The nations all combine: As Edom, Moab, Ishmael, And all of Hagars line. 4 With Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistines, Tyrians plot: And Assur too is join'd with them, To help the sons of Lot. 5 Make them like Midian, or the host That Kison swept away: Whose carcasses upon the earth, Like dung, at Endor lay. 6 Like Oreb Zeb and Zalmuna, Their kings and princes make, Who said, the houses of the Lord Let us surprise and take. 7 As dust or straw before the wind, Or wood, when fire prevails: So persecute them with thy storms, Until their courage fails. 8 With shame, O Lord, their faces fill, That they may seek thy name: Yea let them all confounded be With everlasting shame. 9 That all may know, that thou alone, Whom we Jehovah call, Art Lord most high in all the earth, And rulest over all. Psalm LXXXIV. 1 How amiable are thy tents, O Lord of hosts to me! My soul doth long, my heart doth faint, Thy courts, O Lord to see. 2 For thee the living God I cry, And for thy Altars long, Where sparrows freely build their nests, And swallows lay their young. 3 How blest are they, O Lord of hosts, My God and mighty King, That in thy house forever dwell, And endless praises sing. 4 O blest is he, whose strength thou art, Who loves the ways of them, That through the vale of Baca pass Unto Jerusalem. 5 The pits they dig are fill'd with rain, And so from strength to strength They go, till they before the Lord In Sion come at length. 6 Hear then my prayer, O Lord of hosts, O Jacob's God attend: A gracious look, O God our shield, To thy anointed lend. 7 For in thy Courts one single day, A thousand doth excel: To keep thy doors is better far, Than in sins tents to dwell. 8 For God the Lord our sun and shield Will grace and glory give: And no good thing will he withhold, From them that purely live. 9 O Lord of hosts, what man on earth, Can truly happy be, But he that with a stedfast faith, Doth put his trust in thee. Psalm LXXXV. 1 In bringing back our captives, Lord, How gracious hast thou been! Thou hast forgiven all our faults, And covered all our sin. 2 Thy wrath thou didst remove from us, And from thy fury turn: Turn then, O Saviour, once again, Let wrath no longer burn. 3 Wilt thou forever be displeas'd, And never smile again? And to the Ages yet to come Shall anger still remain? 4 Wilt thou revive thy chosen flock, To joy in thee no more? O shew us mercy, Lord again; And save us as before. 5 I will observe what God will speak; For he to holy men Will promise peace: but let them not To folly turn agen. 6 Doubtless salvation is not far From them that fear his name: That glory in our land may dwell, And flourish in the same. 7 Then peace and justice shall embrace, And truth with mercy meet: Justice from heaven shall appear, And truth beneath our feet. 8 Yea God shall us with plenty bless, An send us happy days: Where righteousness shall be our guide, And keep us in his ways. Psalm LXXXVI. 1 Hear me, O God, for I am poor; Preserve thy holy one: And save thy servant, O my God, Who trusts in thee alone. 2 To thee, O Lord, I daily cry; Be merciful to me: And cause thy servant to rejoice, Who lifts his soul to thee. 3 For thou art ready to forgive, And bountiful to all: In mercy rich to every one That doth for mercy call. 4 Now hear my supplications, Lord, That I present to thee: In trouble I will call on thee, For thou wilt answer me. 5 For there is none among the Gods, That may with thee compare. Nor any works in all the world, That like thy wonders are. 6 To thee by all that dwell on earth, All worship shall be done: For thou art great and dost great things, And thou art God alone. 7 Teach me thy way, and I will walk Forever in the same: O let my heart united be To fear thy holy name. 8 Thee will I praise with all my heart, O Lord, for evermore: For in great mercy from the grave, Thou didst my life restore. 9 O God the proud against me come, And violent men arise; That seek my life, and have not set The Lord before their eyes. 10 But thou art still a gracious God, Thy mercies have no end: O turn to me in mercy then; Thy servant, Lord defend. 11 Shew me a token now for good, That all my foes may see, And be asham'd because the Lord Doth help and comfort me. Psalm LXXXVII. 1 God's temple is on Sion built, And there he loves to dwell: There is no place in Jacob's land, That pleaseth him so well. 2 Great things, O City of the Lord, Of thee recorded are: Nor Rahab, nor great Babylon, May once with thee compare. 3 Both Tyrus and Philistia, But few good men brought forth: And scarce did all Arabia, Produce a man of worth. 4 But this and that, and many more In Zion have been born: And with his fixed residence, The Lord will her adorn. 5 When he shall all the Nations write, And each man's name set down: Some eminent for piety, Shall here and there be found. 6 But out of Zion they shall flow, As waters from a spring: And there with songs and instruments, Shall praise the heavenly king. Psalm LXXXVIII. 1 To thee my Saviour and my Lord, I cry both night and day: O let my words before thee come, And hear me when I pray. 2 My soul is troubled very sore, My life is near the grave: I am like those already dead, And who no power have. 3 I free among the dead men am, That slain and buried lie: Who by thy hand are quite cut off, And out of memory. 4 In lowest pit thou hast me laid, And darkest dungeon thrown: Thy wrath upon me lieth hard, Thy waves have prest me down. 5 My old acquaintance me forsake, They hate and loath me so: As one unclean I am shut up, And forth I cannot go. 6 My eye doth mourn continually, So great my sorrows be: And every day I stretch my hands, And thus I cry to thee. 7 Wilt thou thy wonders shew, O Lord, To them that lie in dust? Shall they arise and tell the world That thou art good and just? 8 Can they in graves thy wonders know, Where bodies lie and rot? Or see thy goodness in the land, Where all things are forgot? 9 But I have cry'd to thee, O Lord, And early will I pray: O why then dost thou cast me off, And turn thy face away? 10 I am afflicted from my youth, And ready am to die, I am almost beside my self, Thou dost so terrifie. 11 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, Thy terrors strike me dead: And I by floods of enemies, Am daily compassed. 12 Thou hast removed far from me, My lover and my friend: My old acquaintance hide themselves, And will no succour lend. Psalm LXXXIX. 1 To sing the mercies of the Lord, My mouth shall never cease: From age to age I will declare His truth and faithfulness. 2 His mercy like a building strong, Forever shall endure: His faithfulness like heaven it self, Shall stand for ever sure. 3 For with my chosen, faith the Lord, A covenant I have made: And to my servant I have sworn, To David I have said. 4 Thy seed I will establish so, It shall to ages last: And make thy throne and government To stand for ever fast. 5 For this thy wondrous mercy, Lord, The heavens shall praise thy name: And all Assemblies of thy saints, Thy faithfulness proclaim. 6 For who of all in heaven above, Can with the Lord compare? Or who can likened be to him, Of all that mighty are? 7 The Lord is greatly to be fear'd, By saints together met: And by all those that him attend, In highest honour set. 8 O Lord, for strength and faithfulness, Is any like to thee? Thou rulest all the raging waves, And billows of the sea. 9 Rahab thou hast in pieces broke, Thy hand did strike them dead: And by thy strong and mighty arm, Thy foes were scattered. 10 The heavens, and earth, and all therein, Thy hand alone did frame: Tabor and Hermon, north and south, Proclaim thy glorious name. 11 Strong is thy arm, and high thy hand, Most righteous is thy throne: Before thy face doth truth proceed With mercy met in one. 12 O blest are they that know thy name, And favour still enjoy: For in thy name they shall rejoice And triumph all the day. 13 For thou, O Lord, wilt be their strength, And them to honour bring: Thou art our shield, the holy one Of Israel our king. 14 In visions thou didst speak and say Unto thy holy one: I have a choice and mighty man Exalted to the throne. 15 My servant David I have found, And him anointed have: With whom my hand shall ever be, To make him stout and brave. 16 The enemy shall not prevail, Nor wicked him subdue: But I will plague and beat them down, That him with hate pursue. 17 Mercy and truth shall be with him, And he so great shall be, That from the river he shall stretch His kingdom to the sea. 18 He shall me God and father call, And me his saviour count: And he shall be my first born son, And highest kings surmount. 19 My mercy I will keep for him, My covenant shall stand fast: His seed upon his throne shall sit As long as heaven shall last. 20 If they my judgments shall forsake, And shall not walk therein: But shall my laws and statutes break, And turn to ways of sin. 21 Then I for sin will visit them, And with my rod correct: But never will my promise break, Nor make of none effect. 22 To David by my holiness, I made an Oath most sure; His seed upon his throne should sit, While Sun and Moon endure. 23 But now on thine anointed king, Thou seemest, Lord, to frown; And quite against thy covenant, To cast his honour down. 24 His bulwarks thou hast broken down, And all his castles fall, A prey to him that passeth by, And scorn to neighbours all. 25 Thou hast advanc'd his enemies, And made his foes so shout, But turned back his sword in fight, And put him to the rout. 26 His glory thou hast made to cease, And cast him to the ground: His youthful days are quite cut off, And shame doth him surround. 27 How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thy self? Shall wrath for ever burn? Remember Lord, how vain we are, How soon to dust we turn. 28 What man is there in all the earth, That death shall never see? And from the power of the grave, What hand can set him free? 29 Where is thine oath to David then? How are those mercies sure, That on his throne his son should sit, And ever should endure? 30 Consider, Lord, thine enemies, How they reproach and mock: And how thy servants every day Are made their laughing stock. 31 They mock at us, because we hope Thy Christ will come and reign: His footsteps are so slow, say they, Your hope is all but vain. 32 But we who on thy promises, Most firmly do rely: Will bless thy name, and evermore, Amen, Amen will cry. Psalm XC. 1 Thou hast, O Lord, from age to age, Our place of refuge been: From everlasting thou art God, Before the world was seen. 2 And unto all eternity, Thou do'st the same remain: Though man decays, and as one dies, Another comes again. 3 For in thy sight a thousand years Are but as yesterday: Or as a watch, that in the night Is quickly past away. 4 Our life is like the sliding floods, Or dreams that vanish quite: Or grass that in the morning grows, And is cut down at night. 5 For by thy wrath we are consum'd, Who all our sins dost see: And what in secret we commit, Is open, Lord to thee. 6 From hence alone it comes to pass, That we so soon decay: And as a tale is quickly told, We pass our years away. 7 For seventy years accounted are, The age of man to be: Or if some stronger than the rest, Full fourscore years should see. 8 Yet even these with all their strength, Endure such misery; That oft their life a burden is, And they at last must die. 9 But, Lord, the power of thy wrath, What man doth lay to heart? Or who is he that ponders well, How terrible thou art? 10 Lord, teach us so to count our days, And lifes uncertainty; That wisely to improve our time, We may our hearts apply. 11 Return, O Lord; how long wilt thou Afflict thy servants thus? Have pity, Lord upon our case, And hast to comfort us. 12 That we who have afflicted been, So many years before, May now be joyful all our days, And evil see no more. 13 Lord, cause thy servants to behold What works thy hand can do: And to their children after them, Thy glorious wonders show. 14 And with thy favour evermore. Our undertakings bless: That what we go about to do, May never want success. Psalm XCI. 1 He that within the secret place Of God most high doth dwell, Beneath the shadow of his wings, Shall be secured well. 2 Therefore I of the Lord will say, He is my fence and fort: He is my God, to whom alone, For help I will resort. 3 He keeps thee from the fowlers snare, And noisome pestilence: His wings shall thy protection be, His truth thy sure defence. 4 Thou shalt not fear the dart by day, Nor terrors of the night: Nor pestilence that walks about In darkness or in light. 5 When thousands fall on either side, It shall not come to thee: But the reward of wicked men, Thine eyes shall plainly see. 6 Because the Lord thy dwelling place, And refuge thou didst call: No plague shall nigh thy dwelling come, Nor evil thee befall. 7 For he shall give his angels charge To keep the safe from harms: And lest thou stumble at a stone, To bear thee in their arms. 8 The Lion and the Adder too. Thou shalt securely tread: Young lions thou shalt trample on, And crush the dragons head. 9 Because he sets his love on me, And trusteth in my name: Therefore I will deliver him, And will advance his fame. 10 His prayer I will surely grant, When he on me shall call: I will restore and raise him up, When troubles him befal. 11 A life both long and prosperous, I will on him bestow: And that I am his Saviour, His eyes shall see and know. Psalm XCII. 1 To thank and praise the Lord most high, It is a comely sight: To shew his mercy and his truth, Both morning and at night. 2 Upon the harp and psaltery, With sweet and solemn voice, For thou O Lord in all thy works, Hast made me to rejoyce. 3 How wondrous are thy works, O Lord, How deep thy counsels are: The bruitish Man perceiveth not, Nor can the fool declare. 4 The flourishing of wicked men, Doth but their fall presage: But thou as Lord most high dost reign, And rule from age to age. 5 For see, thine enemies, O Lord, Thine enemies shall fall: The workers of iniquity, Shall be dispersed all. 6 But high as horns of unicorns, Thou hast exalted me: And as a king with purest oil, I shall anointed be. 7 Mine eye shall my desire behold, Upon my enemies: My ear shall hear the fall of them That up against me rise. 8 Then like the palm or cedar tree, The righteous man shall grow, Or those that in the courts of God Are planted on a row. 9 Which still as they proceed in age, More fair and fruitful be; The righteousness of God my rock, That all may plainly see. Psalm XCIII. 1 The Lord doth reign, and is adorn'd! With power and majesty: In royal robes he is arraid, To shew his dignity. 2 He rules the world, which else long since Had to confusion ran: Yea, Lord, thy throne appointed was, Before the world began. 3 The floods, O Lord, the floods do roar, The mighty billows swell: But thou art stronger far than they, Who dost in heaven dwell. 4 Because thy promises, O Lord, Are very firm and sure; Thy beautiful and holy church, Forever shall endure. Psalm XCIV. 1 O Lord our God, to whom alone All vengeance doth belong; Whose right it is to judge the cause Of them that suffer wrong. 2 Appear, thou judge of all the earth, And from thy holy throne, Requite the proud and insolent, For all that they have done. 3 How long, O Lord, shall wicked men, Insult and triumph thus? How long shall they exalt themselves, And speak hard things of us? 4 They crush thy chosen people, Lord, And heritage oppress: The widow and the stranger slay, And kill the fatherless. 5 And yet they say, God will not see The things that are below: But when, O fools, will ye be wise, Or brutish people know. 6 Shall he that hearing gave to man, Depriv'd of hearing be? Or shall the Lord that form'd the eye, No power have to see? 7 Shall he, that nations doth instruct, An understanding want? Or he that teaches man to know Himself be ignorant? 8 Yea sure it is, that all things here The Lord doth plainly see: From whom no vain or idle thought, Can once concealed be. 9 O blest is he whom God corrects, Who by his law is taught: In trouble thou wilt give him rest, When wicked men are caught. 10 For thou thy flock and heritage, Wilt not forsake nor fail: Till righteousness restored be, And uprightness prevail. 11 For who against the wicked men, Will to my succour come? Unless the Lord had been my help, I had been almost dumb. 12 But when I said, my foot doth slip, Thy mercy me upheld: Thy comforts Lord amidst my thoughts Did sweetest pleasure yield. 13 With those unrighteous magistrates Thou never wilt consent, Who to establish wickedness, Mischievous laws invent. 14 They meet together to consult Against the just man's blood: And study how they may condemn The innocent and good. 15 But thou art my defence, O Lord, Against this wicked race: Thou art the God in whom I trust, My rock and hiding place. 16 And thou wilt bring upon their heads, Their own iniquities: And cut them off by wicked plots, Themselves did first devise. Psalm XCV. 1 Come let us sing unto the Lord, With loud and chearful voice: And to our Saviour and our rock, In pleasant songs rejoyce. 2 Let us before his presence come, And psalms of praises sing: For he alone is God of Gods, The great and mighty King. 3 The deepest vales, and highest hills, Were formed by his hand: 'Tis he alone whose mighty power, Hath made both sea and land. 4 Come let us bow before the Lord, And to our maker fall: He is our God, and we his flock, And he doth feed us all. 5 To day; if ye will hear his voice, Then be not obstinate, As in the provocation once, In that temptation great. 6 When in the wilderness of old, Your fathers tempted me, And did my power in question call, Though they my works did see. 7 Full forty years I grieved was With that rebellious race: And said they are perverse in heart, And have not known my ways. 8 And therefore with a solemn oath, I did in wrath protest, That none of them should ever come Into my land of rest. Psalm XCVI. 1 Sing to the Lord, O all the earth, A psalm, or song most new: O bless his name from day to day, And his salvation shew. 2 Among the heathen let his works, And wonders all be heard: For he is great above all Gods, And greatly to be fear'd. 3 Their Gods are Idols; but the Lord Did make the heavens high: Within his house all beauty dwells, With power and majesty. 4 Give to the Lord, ye nations all, All glory, power, and fame: Give to the Lord the glory due To his most holy name. 5 With offerings come into his courts, And in his temple fair, Let all the earth before him come, And give him worship there. 6 Let Heathens know the Lord is king, And rules the world aright: And all men shall most righteously Be judged in his sight. 7 Let heaven triumph, and earth be glad, And seas lift up their voice: The field, and all that is therein, With every tree rejoyce. 8 Before the Lord: for see, he comes, He comes the earth to try: And judge the people of the world With truth and equity. Psalm XCVII. 1 The Lord doth reign: rejoyce O earth, And islands every one: He comes with clouds, to sit as judge Upon his holy throne. 2 A fire before him shall devour His enemies every where: His lightnings flew, and all the earth Beheld, and quak'd for fear. 3 Before the Lord of all the earth, The melted hills ran down: Both heaven and earth declare his truth, And speak of his renown. 4 Blush, ye that worship images, And boast of them no more: But reverence the Son of God, Whom angels all adore. 5 Sion shall hear it and be glad, And Judah pleased well: For thou art Lord of all the earth, And do'st all God's excel. 6 Let every one that loves the Lord, All evil ways detest: For he will keep and save his saints, By wicked hands opprest. 7 For all upright and righteous men, Both light and joy are sown: Then let them all in God rejoyce, And praise the holy one. Psalm XCVIII. 1 O sing new songs unto the Lord, His wonders magnifie: For his right hand, and holy arm, Hath got the victory. 2 The Lord hath his salvation shown, To all most clear and bright: His righteousness he hath declar'd In all the heathens sight. 3 Most mindful of his promises, To Israel he has been: And all the nations of the earth, Have his salvation seen. 4 Then sing aloud unto the Lord, Let all his praises sing: With trumpet, harp, and cornet too, Before the Lord the King. 5 The roaring sea, the spacious earth, With their inhabitants: Let floods and rivers clap their hands, And hills together dance. 6 Before the Lord: for see he comes From heaven with glory bright, To judge the nations of the world With equity and right. Psalm XCIX. 1 The Lord upon his throne doth reign Though people fret and frown: He sits between the cherubims, Though th' earth moves up and down. 2 In Zion and in all the earth, The Lord alone is king: And to his great and holy name, Let all with praises sing. 3 This mighty king doth judgment love, And equity command: And by the same doth govern all That dwell in Jacob's land. 4 Then magnifie the Lord our God, Exalt this holy king: Before his footstool humbly bow, And supplications bring. 5 Thus Moses, Aaron, Samuel, Upon his name did call: And other priests and saints of old, And he did hear them all. 6 He from the pillar of a cloud To them declar'd his will: And they his statutes did observe, And his commands fulfil. 7 At their request, when Israel Had sinned in thy sight, Thou did'st correct them for their sin, But not destroy them quite. 8 In Sion praise the Lord our God, And worship at the same: For he is on his holy hill, And holy is his name. Psalm C. 1 O all ye people every where, In sweetest notes your voices raise: Before the Lord with joy appear, And sing aloud unto his praise. 2 Confess that he is God alone, Who us without our help did make: He freely chose us for his own, And for his flock he did us take. 3 O enter then his gates with joy, And in his courts his praise proclaim: In giving thanks your tongues employ, And ever bless his holy name. 4 Because the Lord is good and kind, His mercies evermore endure: His truth and promise all shall find, From age to age most firm and sure. Psalm CI. 1 Of mercy, Lord, and judgment both, I now will sing to thee: And wisely will behave my self, When thou shalt come to me. 2 Within my house I mean to walk, With heart and mind sincere: Nor suffer any wicked thing, Before me to appear. 3 The work of them that turn aside To me shall never cleave: A froward or a wicked man, My house shall not receive. 4 Whoever doth backbiting love, I will expel him quite: Nor suffer proud and haughty men To come within my sight. 5 Upon the faithful in the land, My eyes shall ever be: And he that walks in perfect ways, Shall servant be to me. 6 The false and the deceitful man, With me shall never dwell: Nor shall he tarry in my sight, That lies delights to tell. 7 My hand shall speedily destroy The wicked from his place: And from the city of the Lord, Cut off that cursed race. Psalm CII. 1 Lord hear my prayer, and do not hide Thy face in time of need: But in my trouble bow thine ear, And answer me with speed. 2 For as an hearth my bones are burnt, My days like smoke do pass: My heart with sorrow smitten is, And withered like the grass. 3 I quite forget to eat my bread; And with my cries and groans, Am so consum'd, that all my skin Doth cleave unto my bones. 4 As Pelican in wilderness, Or as the owls I moan: And like the sparrow on the house, I watch and sit alone. 5 All day mine enemies slander me, And swear to what they say: My bread is ashes, and my drink Is weeping every day. 6 So great thine indignation is, Thine anger and thy frown: For thou at first did'st lift me up, And after cast me down. 7 My days are like declining shades, Or like the fading grass: But thou forever shalt endure, Thy age shall never pass. 8 Arise O Lord, and mercy shew Unto thy Zion dear: For now the fixed time is come, The time to favour her. 9 For in the very stones thereof, Thy servants take delight: Her very rubbish, and her dust Are precious in their sight. 10 So shall the heathens dread thy name, And kings thy glory fear: When thou shalt build thy Zion up, And gloriously appear. 11 Then thou wilt hear the poor mans prayer, And we will it record, That generations yet unborn, May know, and praise the Lord. 12 For he from heaven hath looked down, From heaven his temple high: To hear their groans, and set them free, That were condemn'd to die. 13 That men thy glorious name and praise, In Zion may declare: When people meet to serve the Lord, And kingdoms worship there. 14 But as for me, my strength is gone, My life apace decays: I said, Lord, take me not away, In midst of all my days. 15 Thy years, O Son of God shall last, Though heaven and earth shall fade: And all th e works shall pass away, That by thy hands were made. 16 As garments change and fade with age, So shall they changed be: But thou art evermore the same, Thy years no end shall see. 17 The children of thy servants dear, From age to age shall last: Their seed shall flourish in their sight, And stand forever fast. Psalm CIII. 1 My Soul and all that in me is, O bless and praise the Lord: His gifts and all his benefits, In thankful mind record. 2 Who freely pardons all thy sins, And heals thee of thy pain: Who did redeem thy life from death, And bring thee back again. 3 Who crowns thee with his mercies great, And with good things doth fill: And makes thy youth like eagles plumes, To be renewed still. 4 The Lord doth judgment execute, For them that are opprest: Moses and Israel saw his ways, His acts were manifest. 5 The Lord is kind and merciful, To anger he is slow: But mercy most abundantly, In him doth ever flow. 6 He will not alway chide with us, Nor for our sins requite, As we in strictness have deserv'd, And as he justly might. 7 High as the heavens, to godly men, So are his mercies great: Our sins he doth remove as far As east from west is set. 8 He, as a father, pities them That fear his holy name: He calls to mind we are but dust, And thinks upon our frame. 9 He sees that man is but as grass, And like a fading flower; That by a blast is quickly gone, And shall be seen no more. 10 But with the godly and their seed, Shall truth and mercy stay: To such as keep his covenant, And his commands obey. 11 The Lord his glorious judgment seat In heaven hath prepar'd: His kingdom ruleth over all, And he is to be fear'd. 12 O bless the Lord, ye angels all, That are at his command: Ye mighty hosts and ministers, That in his presence stand. 13 Yea let his great and holy name, Exalted be and blest, By all his creatures every where, And me among the rest. Psalm CIV. 1 My soul shall bless thy name, O Lord, For thou art God most high: With honour great thou art arrai'd, And cloth'd with majesty. 2 With glistring robes of purest light, Thou art enclos'd about: And as a curtain round thy throne The heavens are stretched out. 3 His chambers on the waters lie, And clouds his chariots are: And him upon their mighty wings The winds most swiftly bear. 4 The angels are his ministers, That round about him stand: And swift as flames of lightning fly If he but gives command. 5 The strong foundations of the earth, He hath so surely laid: That it can never be remov'd, But by his power is staid. 6 When mighty floods did cover it, And tops of mountains hide: At thy rebuke they fled away, Nor would thy voice abide. 7 And though from hills to vales they flow, Yet thou hast set a bound, They cannot pass; nor turn again, To cover all the ground. 8 The springs into the vales he sends, Between the hills to glide: At which wild asses quench their thirst, And every beast beside. 9 By them the birds shall build their nests, That on the branches sing: The hills are watered by his clouds, And fruit in plenty bring. 10 He causes grass for beasts to grow, And herb to serve man's use: And makes the earth for every thing, Convenient food produce. 11 The wine that chears the heart of man, The oil that beauty gives: And bread the great support of man, By which he daily lives. 12 The cedar tall, of Lebanon, By him with sap are fill'd: Where birds are wont to make their nests, And firs for storks to build. 13 Upon the lofty hills and rocks, Where nothing seems to grow, The wild goats and the coneys find Both food and shelter too. 14 He hath ordain'd, that by the moon The seasons should be known: And constantly the sun observes His times of going down. 15 When night is come, in forrests then The wild beasts creep abroad: Young lions roaring for their prey, Do seek their meat from God. 16 But at sun-rising, in their dens, Again themselves they hide: And man unto his labour goes, Until the even-tide. 17 How various are thy works, O Lord! And all contriv'd with skill: The earth so deep, the sea so wide, Thy endless riches fill. 18 There go the ships, there fishes swim In shoals, of every sort: And mighty whales, which thou hast made, Therein to play and sport. 19 All these depend and wait on thee, In season for their food: Thou openest thy hand to them, And they are fill'd with good. 20 Thou hid'st thy face, and they return To dust, from whence they came: And thou do'st stock the world again, With others of the same. 21 All glory shall forever be, Unto the Lord alone: He shall rejoyce in all the works, His mighty hand hath done. 22 If he but looks upon the earth, It trembleth presently: And if he does but touch the hills, In smoke away they fly. 23 I will sing praises to the Lord, As long as I shall live: To think on him, and praise his name, Shall sweetest pleasure give. 24 Let sinners perish from the earth, And wicked be no more: But I will ever bless the Lord, And him alone adore. Psalm CV. 1 Give thanks unto the Lord our God, And call upon his name: Make known his acts in every place, And spread his mighty fame. 2 Sing to the Lord, sing psalms to him, His wonders all record: Exalt his name with joyful hearts, All ye that seek the Lord. 3 Seek ye the Lord, and seek his strength, And favour evermore: Remember well his wondrous works, And judgments heretofore. 4 O Abraham's, and Jacob's seed, Who was his chosen one. He is our God, whose judgments just, In all the world are known. 5 His covenant he remembred well, The word that he had spoke: And though a thousand ages pass, He will it not revoke. 6 To Abraham, Isaac, Israel, He did his oath engage; The land of Canaan to bestow, To be their heritage. 7 When they but few in number were, And strangers in it too: Yea when they went from place to place, And wandred too and fro. 8 He suffer'd none to do them wrong, But kings themselves did warn: See; touch not my anointed ones, Nor do my prophets harm. 9 Yea when he for a famine call'd, And broke the staff of bread: Yet sent he Joseph to prevent Their being famished. 10 Who into Egypts land was sold, And there a servant made: Whose feet they hurt with fetters strong, And him in irons laid. 11 Until the time in which the Lord To try him did decree: And then the king immediately Did send and set him free. 12 He made him ruler of his house, And all that he possest: To bind his lords, and punish them, As he should see it best. 13 Then Israel into Egypt came, And there so multipli'd; They quickly grew more numerous Than all the land beside. 14 At this their enemies were enrag'd With jealousie and spite: And craftily contriv'd to wast, And to destroy them quite. 15 Moses and Aaron then were sent, Whom he had chosen out, To shew his signs in Egypt's land, And wonders all about. 16 He spake, and over all the land The plague of darkness flew: He turn'd their rivers into blood, And all their fishes slew. 17 The land brought forth such swarms of frogs, Kings chambers were not free: All sorts of noisome flies and lice, Were sent by his decree. 18 He gave them hail instead of rain, And flaming fire withal: He smote their vines and fig-trees too, And plants both great and small. 19 He spake, and caterpillars came, Whose numbers were so great, That they devoured every herb, And all their fruits did eat. 20 He smote the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength: And so with silver and with gold, He brought them out at length. 21 No person was in all their tribes, But what was sound and well: Egypt was glad when they were gone, For fear upon them fell. 22 By day he led them with a cloud, That covered them from sight: And with a pillar all of fire, He guided them by night. 23 They asked, and he gave them quails, And bread from heaven sent down: He clave the rock, and waters ran, In dry and barren ground. 24 For he remembred Abraham, And on his promise thought: And from their bondage at the last, With joy his people brought. 25 And gave them all the lands and wealth, The heathens had possest: That they his statutes might observe; His name be ever blest. Psalm CVI. 1 Praise ye the Lord, for he is good, His mercies endless are. Who can relate his mighty acts, And all his praise declare? 2 Blessed are they that keep his laws, And never thence decline: Lord, number me among thy flock, And visit me as thine. 3 That I may see the happiness Of those that are thy choice: And with thine own inheritance, May glory and rejoyce. 4 Our fathers, Lord, have deeply sinn'd, And we the same have done: We have committed wickedness, And in their steps have gone. 5 Thy mighty works in Egypt done, They did not bear in mind: Nor think how gracious thou had'st been, How merciful and kind. 6 But when to the red sea they came, They did thine anger move: And yet the Lord delivered them Of his meer grace and love. 7 By his rebuke he dri'd the sea, His power to express: And led them safely through the deep, As through the wilderness. 8 He sav'd them from their enemies, And did their lives redeem: But every man that hated them Was cover'd in the stream. 9 Then they believ'd his words a while, And gladly sung his praise: But soon forgot his works again, Nor did observe his ways. 10 But lusted in the wilderness, And tempted God most high: Who gave them what they did request, But plagu'd them presently. 11 They envied Moses in the camp, And holy Aaron too, For which the earth did ope her mouth, And down they quick did go. 12 Dathan, Abiram, and the rest Of that ungodly train: And others of their company By fire from heaven were slain. 13 At Horeb too a molten calf, They made and worshipped: As if their God were like an ox, That on the grass is fed. 14 Thus God their Saviour they forgot, Who had his wonders shown In Egypt; and at the red sea His dreadful works had done. 15 Therefore in wrath he did resolve, He every man would slay: If Moses had not stopt the breach, And turn'd his wrath away. 16 Yea they despis'd the pleasant land, Nor did believe his word: But murmured within their tents, And disobey'd the Lord. 17 Who swore that in the wilderness, His hand should root them out: And scatter their posterity In all the land about. 18 Baal Peor they did worship too, And dead mens offerings eat: Until the plague upon them came, His anger was so great. 19 Then Phineas rose, and vengeance took And staid the plague so sore: Which counted was for righteousness To him for evermore. 20 They vex'd him too at Meribah, That Moses worse did fare, Provoking him to speak amiss, Before he was aware. 21 Nor, as the Lord commanded them, Did they the nations slay: But with the heathens mingled were, And learn'd their wicked way. 22 They worshipped their idol gods, Which soon a snare became: Yea sacrific'd their children dear To devils in the flame. 23 And shed the blood of innocents, Their own poor harmless brood, Whom they to Canaan's idols flew, And stain'd the land with blood. 24 Thus with their works they were defil'd By whoring from the Lord: For which his wrath was kindled so, That he his flock abhorr'd. 25 And gave them up into the hands Of heathens merciless, Who cruelly enslaved them, And sorely did oppress. 26 Yet many a time he saved them, But they did still provoke, And so for their iniquities Were brought into the yoak. 27 Yet in distress he heard their cry, And of his grace and love: He thought upon his covenant, And did his hand remove. 28 Yea turned so the hearts of those That had them captives led, That by their very enemies Their case was pitied. 29 Now save us, Lord, and bring us back, That we our tongues may frame To sing and triumph in thy praise, And bless thy holy name. 30 Blest be the God of Israel, To which with one accord, Let all the people say amen, Amen, praise ye the Lord. Psalm CVII. 1 O bless the Lord, for he is good, No end his mercies know: And let his own redeemed ones Confess it to be so. 2 Who sav'd them from their enemies, And from their bondage bought: And when they were dispers'd about, From every quarter brought. 3 They wandred in the wilderness, Where cities there are none: And when with hunger and with thirst Their life was almost gone. 4 Then in distress they cri'd to God, And he deliverance sent: And led them right, that they at last Unto a city went. 5 O that all men would praise the Lord; For all his goodness then, And for the wonders he has done Before the sons of men. 6 He satisfies the longing soul, That cries to him for food, And when they are with hunger pin'd, He filleth them with good. 7 Poor prisoners that in darkness sit, Fast bound in iron bands, Because they sinn'd against the Lord, And slighted his commands. 8 For which he justly brought them down To misery and grief: They cri'd, and there was none to help, Nor to afford relief. 9 Then in distress they cri'd to God, Who did compassion take: And from their dungeons brought them out, And all their fetters brake. 10 O that all men would praise the Lord, For all his goodness then, And for the wonders he has done Before the sons of men. 11 For he has broke the gates of brass, By his great power and might: And strongest bars of Iron made, Has cut in sunder quite. 12 When foolish men are plagu'd for sin, And under sickness lie; So that they can no succour take, But ready are to die. 13 Then in their troubles and distress They cry unto the Lord: And he from death delivers them, And heals them by his word. 14 O that all men would praise the Lord, For all his goodness then, And for the wonders he has done Before the sons of men. 15 Yea let them all before him come, And sacrifices bring; To thank him for his mighty works, And to his honour sing. 16 All they whose business lies in ships, And on the ocean keep, These see the mighty works of God, And wonders in the deep. 17 For he commands the stormy wind, That lifteth up the waves: They mount to heaven and down again, As into gulphs or graves. 18 So that their hearts within them melt, They stagger to and fro; Like drunken or distracted men, And know not what to do. 19 Then in distress they cry to God, And he from trouble saves: He turns the storm into a calm, And stills the raging waves. 20 He makes their hearts to leap for joy, To see the danger past: And so to their desired port He brings them safe at last. 21 O that all men would praise the Lord, For all his goodness then; And for the wonders he has done Before the sons of men. 22 Let them exalt his glorious name, In congregations great: And praise him where the elders are, In their assemblies met. 23 He to a desart turns a land, Where rivers did abound: And where the springs were wont to flow, To dry and barren ground. 24 He turns a fat and fruitful soil To barrenness for sin, And for the heinous wickedness Of them that dwell therein. 25 Again to lakes and fruitful springs, He turns a wilderness: And makes the hungry there to dwell, And cities to possess. 26 And sow the fields and vineyards plant, That great increase may give: And makes them all, both man and beast To multiply and thrive. 27 And when they are diminished, And almost come to nought, Oppressed by their enemies, And to affliction brought: 28 Then he on princes pours contempt, That they to desarts fly: But sets the poor man up aloft, And makes him multiply: 29 The righteous man shall much rejoyce, These works of God to see: But wicked men shall stop their mouths, And quite confounded be. 30 Whoso is wise, and will observe, These things with due regard, May clearly see and understand The goodness of the Lord. Psalm CVIII. 1 To sing to thee, O Lord my God, My heart is fixt and bent; Bet imes I will awake, and praise With voice and instrument. 2 Among thy chosen people, Lord, I will exalt thy fame: And in the nations round about, Sing praises to thy name. 3 Thy truth and mercy are extol'd, Above the clouds and skies; Yea far above the heavens and earth, Thy glorious name shall rise. 4 Save then thy well beloved flock, Which thou hast chose for thine: Defend them, Lord, by thy right hand, And hear this prayer of mine. 5 What God has in his temple spoke, I now rejoyce to see: For Shechem now and Succoth vale Are both possest by me. 6 Both Gilead and Manasseh too, Are now become mine own: Strong Ephraim, with Judah's tribe, To which belongs the crown. 7 Proud Moab shall my wash-pot be, On Edom I will tread: And over the Philistines land, In triumph will proceed. 8 But who will Edom's city strong; Enable me to take? Lord, wilt not thou, who heretofore Our armies did forsake? 9 O help us in our troubles, Lord, In man there is no trust: But we through thee shall valiant be, And tread our foes to dust. Psalm CIX. 1 Hold not thy peace at my complaint; O God of all my praise: For wicked men with open mouth Against me slanders raise. 2 They compass me with all the words That malice can devise: Without the least desert of mine, They are my enemies. 3 I pray'd for them most heartily, But they for my good will Have hated me; and for my love Rewarded me with ill. 4 Leave him to Satan; and let him At his right hand appear: In judgment let him be condemn'd, Nor his Petition hear. 5 Shorten his days, that so his charge Another man may take: His children ever fatherless, His wife a widow make. 6 Let all his race be vagabonds, To wander up and down: And beg in places desolate For bread; where there is none 7 Let the extortioner devour The fruit of all his toil: And what he by his labour got, Let strangers take and spoil. 8 Let no man any mercy shew To him, nor to his race: That in the next succeeding age Their names may have no place. 9 His fathers and his mothers sins, O Lord, forget them not: But visit them upon their seed, Until their names shall rot. 10 Because he did no mercy shew, But persecute the poor: That he might slay the needy man, Whose heart was broke before. 11 Of curses let him plenty have, Since he did cursing love: And as he blessing loved not, Thy blessings, Lord, remove. 12 As he with cursing cloath'd himself, Like water make them flow Into his bowels, and like oil Into his bones to go. 13 Close as his garments let them cleave, And like his girdle be: Thus, Lord, reward my enemies, And those that slander me. 14 But save me for thy holy name, Who good and gracious art; For I am poor and desolate, And sorrow wounds my heart. 15 I flee like shadows, and am toss'd As locusts by the wind: My very knees with fasting fail, And all my flesh is pin'd. 16 I was despis'd, and all that saw, At me their heads did shake: Now help and save me, O my God, For thy great mercies sake. 17 That they may know it is thy hand, That has delivered me: And when I am accurs'd by them, Let me be blest by thee. 18 Confound them, Lord, but give me cause To triumph in thy name: As with a mantle, let them all Be covered with shame. 19 Then I in highest strains of praise Unto the Lord will sing: Yea I among the multitude Will make his praise to ring. 20 Who standeth by the innocent, And poor to rescue them From those that judge unrighteously, And would their souls condemn. Psalm CX. 1 The Lord to Christ my Lord hath said, Sit thou on high at my right hand: Until thy foes the stool are made, On which thou mai'st triumphing stand. 2 Thy scepter shall from Zion rise, From thence the Lord shall make it spring: And thou amidst thine enemies, Shalt ever reign a glorious king. 3 A willing people in that day, Shall in thy holy church be found: And be enlarged every way, As morning dew doth spread the ground. 4 The Lord did with an oath protest, Nor will repent what he did speak: Thou art an everlasting priest, According to Melchizedeck. 5 This glorious and Almighty prince, That sits in heaven at God's right hand, When once his day of wrath begins, Shall strike through kings that him withstand. 6 His judgments shall on heathens fall, Till earth be covered with the slain: And wound their mighty monarchs all, That over many kingdoms reign. 7 The brook that runneth in the way, That to his glorious throne doth lead, He first shall drink, and then with joy, Lift up to heaven his royal head. Psalm CXI. 1 I Will extol and praise the Lord, With all my heart and mind: Where upright men, to worship him, Are in assemblies join'd. 2 Great are his works, sought out of them, That love to meditate: To them most glorious they appear, And infinitely great. 3 They never ought to be forgot, For he is good and kind: For them that fear him he provides, And doth his promise mind. 4 To them he shew'd his mighty works, And wonders of his hand, When they for an inheritance, Possest the heathens land. 5 His works are all most just and right, And his commands are sure: Most true and upright is his word, And ever shall endure. 6 To his redeemed ones he gave An everlasting Law: Most holy is the name of God, And to be had in aw. 7 All wisdom at his fear begins, And truly wise are none, But they that keep his holy laws: All praise to him alone. 2. Metre. 1 The Lord I will extol, With all my heart and soul, Where upright men are met: For they that search and mind, Shall clearly see and find, That all his works are great. 2 Highly to be extoll'd, And glorious to behold, His mercy faileth not: The wonders he has done, And his compassions shown, Can never be forgot. 3 The Lord hath duly fed, As he had promised, All those that fear his name: And given the heathens land, To be at their command. To shew his power and fame. 4 The works that he has done, Are faithful every one, And his commands are sure: All fram'd, we must confess, In truth and uprightness, And ever shall endure. 5 He did his flock redeem, From bondage most extreme, And gave to them a law, Which shall remain the same; Most holy is his name, And to be had in aw. 6 His fear is that wherein All wisdom doth begin; And none are wise beside, But they, and only they That his commands obey, His name be magnifi'd. Psalm CXII. 1 The man is blest, that fears the Lord, And dearly loves his word: His seed shall mighty be on earth, And blessed of the Lord. 2 The wealch and riches he has got, Shall to his house be sure: And blessings on his family, For ever shall endure. 3 To him that good and upright is, In darkness light shall rise: For mercy still is in his heart, And pity in his eyes. 4 He sheweth favour, and doth lend, And all things wisely guide: Therefore he shall not moved be, But ever shall abide. 5 He shall no evil tidings fear, Who on the Lord relies: But shall in time the downfal see Of all his enemies. 6 He has dispersed liberally, His alms unto the poor: And shall with honour be repaid, And bliss for evermore. 7 The wicked man shall gnash his teeth, His happy state to see: And shall with envy pine away, And quite consumed be. 2. Metre. 1 Happy the man, who God doth fear, And dearly loves his holy word: His children shall be mighty here, And ever blessed of the Lord. All earthly blessings he will send, And those above, that never end. 2 To him that good and upright is, In darkness shall the light arise: For he shall mercy never miss, That mercy sets before his eyes. He gives and lends most liberally, And wisely guides his charity. 3 Therefore he shall for ever stand, Nor of ill news shall be afraid: For on the Lord his hopes depend, And he will be his help and aid, Till he beholdeth with his eyes The downfal of his enemies. 4 His wealth he out hath freely laid; And bounteously reliev'd the poor: And by the Lord shall be repaid With honour here and evermore. While wicked men shall gnash to see, And quite consum'd with envy be. Psalm CXIII. 1 O all ye Servants of the Lord, Praise ye his name with one accord; Yea let his praise be ever sung: Who from the rising of the sun, Till it returns where it begun, Is to be prais'd by every tongue. 2 To him let all the nations fall, For he is higher far than all; His glory is above the sky: With God our Lord who may compare, Whose dwellings in the heavens are; Such is his power and majesty. 3 He doth abase himself, we know, When he beholds the things below, Yea even those in heaven above: He from the dust doth raise the poor, And from the dunghil him restore, Such is his mercy, and his love. 4 To lift him up to honour great, And him with princes equal set, Yea princes of the greatest fame: 'Tis he that makes the barren womb A joyful mother to become, Therefore praise ye his holy name. Psalm CXIV. 1 When from the strange Egyptian land The Lord did Israel bring, In Judah was his holy place, And there he sat as king. 2 The sea beheld and backward went, And Jordan fled away: The mountains skipt about like rams, And hills like lambs did play. 3 What means the sea thus to retreat, And Jordan flee away: The mountains skip about like rams, And hills like lambs to play? 4 Tremble thou earth before the Lord, At sight of Jacob's king: Who to a fountain turn'd the rock, And flint into a spring. Psalm CXV. 1 Not unto us, Lord, not to us Is any glory due: But to thy name, who art a God Most merciful and true. 2 Why should the heathens say to us, Your God, where is he now? Our God is in the heavens high, And what he wills can do. 3 Their gods of gold and silver made, True God's can never be: For they have mouths but cannot speak, And eyes, but cannot see. 4 And ears they have but cannot hear The prayers that are made, Nor can their nose the incense smell Upon their altars laid. 5 Hands too they have, but handle not, And feet but cannot go: Nor in their throats is any breath, That passeth too and fro. 6 Their makers are as dull as they, And have as little sense: And so are all that in such Gods, Repose their confidence. 7 O Israel, and Aaron's house, And all that fear the Lord, Trust ye in him, for he alone Can help and strength afford. 8 The Lord hath mindful been of us, And he will bless us all; Both Israel, and Aaron's house, And all that on him call. 9 Both you and your posterity, The Lord will still encrease: The Lord that made the heavens and earth, To bless will never cease. 10 The heaven of heavens is the Lords, But he the earth doth give, To mortal men, to use the same As long as here they live. 11 The dead no more can praise the Lord, Nor they in graves adore: But we will bless and praise his name, Both now, and evermore. Psalm CXVI. 1 I love the Lord, who to my cry A gracious ear did lend: And therefore I will call on him, Until my life shall end. 2 The pangs of death surrounded me; The pains of hell got hold: And thus I cry'd unto the Lord, O Lord preserve my soul! 3 The Lord is good and gracious, His mercy large and free: And he that saves the innocent, In trouble helped me. 4 Turn to thy rest then, O my soul, Who hast his goodness seen: My life from death, my eyes from tears Have now delivered been. 5 My feet from falling he has kept, For which I praise will give: And walk uprightly in his sight, As long as I shall live. 6 I said, when in my hast I fled, In man there is no trust: But by experience I have found, The Lord is true and just. 7 Now what shall I unto the Lord For all his mercies bring? I will the cup of blessings take, And to his name will sing. 8 My vows I to the Lord will pay, Before his people here; To whom the blood of all his saints, Most precious is, and dear: 9 I am thy bounden servant, Lord, I own most solemnly: None bought or born within the house, Are servants more than I. 10 Therefore the sacrifice of praise, I to the Lord will bring: And in the sight of all his saints, Present my offering. 11 My vows I to his house will bring, And duly pay the same, Within thee, O Jerusalem, Praise ye his holy name. Psalm CXVII. 1 By all the Gentiles every where, The Lord exalted be: And let his people Israel Unto the same agree. 2 For now his promise is fulfil'd, And we are all the same: Then let us all together join, And praise his holy name. Psalm CXVIII. 1 O thank the Lord, for he is good, His mercies endless are: And let the house of Israel The self-same thing declare. 2 Let Aaron's house acknowledge it, And all that fear the Lord, That his compassions have no end. Confess with one accord. 3 I cry'd to him in my distress, And he did answer me: And when I was in greatest straits His hand did set me free. 4 I will not fear what man can do, Since God will take my part: And grant me my desire on them, That hate me from their heart. 5 Better it is to trust in God, Than on man's help rely: Better it is to trust in God, Than kings and princes high. 6 Though nations compass me about, I will destroy them all: They compass, yea they compass me, But through the Lord shall fall. 7 When they like bees about me flew, I quench'd lhem like the flame Of thorns; and will destroy them all In his most holy name: 8 They pressed hard to beat me down, But he did succour bring: He is my Saviour, and my strength, And I to him will sing. 9 Among the tents of righteous men, Great shouts of joy are heard: The Lord's right hand great things hath done, And gloriously appear'd. 10 I shall not die, but live to shew The Lord's great power and might: Who, though he did chastise me sore, Did not forsake me quite. 11 Set open then the gates to me, The gates of righteousness: That I into his house may go, And there his praise confess. 12 This is the gate of God's own house, Where righteous men resort: The Lord hath heard and saved me, And I will praise him for't. 13 The stone is on the corner set, The builders did despise: This is the mighty work of God, And wondrous in our eyes. 14 This is the day the Lord has made, And we with joy will cry, Hosanna to the Son of God, With all prosperity. 15 O blessed be the King that comes In God's most holy name: And from the temple of the Lord, Let all resound the same. 16 Since God the Lord has shew'd us light, Let us with thankful mind, Our sacrifice and offerings Upon his altar bind. 17 Thou art my God, and thee to praise I never will forbear: Thou art my God, and thus I will Exalt thee every where. 18 âO pay your thanks unto the Lord; âHis goodness All adore: âBecause his mercy and his love âEndure for evermore. Psalm CXIX. [I.] 1 Blessed are they that are sincere, And upright in their way: Whose lives and conversations From God's laws never stray. 2 Blessed are they that keep his word, And seek him with their heart: That walk in his most holy ways, And from all sin depart. 3 Thou hast commanded us, O Lord, Our steps with care to guide: O that my ways directed were, That I may never slide. 4 Then shall I not ashamed be, But shew my self sincere: When I to all thy holy laws A due respect shall bear. 5 Then with a true and upright heart, I will advance thy praise: When I shall learn thy judgments just, And understand thy ways. 6 And when of thy most holy will, I have the knowledge got: I will perform it by thy grace; O Lord, forsake me not. II. 1 How shall a young man cleanse his way From all impurity? By marking well thy holy word, To guide his life thereby. 2 With all my heart I have thee sought, And earnestly did pray: O never suffer me, O Lord, From thy commands to stray. 3 Thy word I in my heart have hid, That I might never sin: Teach me thy law, O blessed Lord, And me instruct therein. 4 My lips, O Lord, have never ceas'd, To others to declare The righteous judgments of thy mouth, How good and sweet they are. 5 To walk in thy most holy ways, I have rejoyc'd no less, Than worldly men in all the wealth, And treasures they possess. 6 Thy precepts shall my study be, On which my mind is set, And I in them will so delight, As never to forget. III. 1 Thy grace unto thy servant, Lord, So bountifully give: That I may keep thy holy word, As long as I shall live. 2 Open my eyes, O gracious God, And so enlighten me, That of thy wise and holy law, The wonders I may see. 3 I am a stranger in the earth; Hide not thy word, O Lord: My very heart begins to break With longing for thy word. 4 Thou do'st rebuke and curse the proud, That from thy precepts stray: But let no shame to me approach, For I have kept thy way. 5 Though princes did against me speak, And that without a cause: Yet did thy servant meditate On thy most holy laws. 6 When troubles come, they are my joy, And all my hearts delight: And they are all my counsellors, To guide my steps aright. IV. 1 My soul unto the dust doth cleave, Through misery and pain: According to thy promise, Lord, Revive me once again. 2 I have confest my ways to thee, And thou did'st me forgive: O teach me for the time to come, How I aright may live. 3 Make me, O Lord to understand Thy precepts every one: And then I will to others tell What wonders thou hast done. 4 My soul is faint, and melts away, By reason of my grief: According to thy promises, Lord, send me some relief. 5 Grant me, O Lord, thy holy law, Remove the way of lies: For I have chose the way of truth, And set before mine eyes. 6 I cleave unto thy laws, O Lord, O put me not to shame: And when thou shalt enlarge my heart, I will perform the same. V. 1 Instruct me, Lord, that I may know Thy laws and holy ways: And stedfastly I will resolve To keep them all my days. 2 Grant me the knowledge of thy law, And I my self will bind, To keep and to observe it well With all my heart and mind. 3 Thy ways in which I so delight, O help me, Lord, to run: Encline my heart to love thy word, And covetousness to shun. 4 From all these worldly vanities, Lord, turn away my sight: And of thy mercy quicken me, To walk thy ways aright. 5 Perform the word which thou hast spoke To them that fear thy name: Nor let me break thy laws so good, To my eternal shame. 6 Behold, O Lord, how I have long'd To know thy holy will: O quicken me so with thy grace, That I may it fulfil. VI. 1 O let thy tender mercies come, And succour me, O Lord: And be my help and Saviour, According to thy word. 2 So shall I have to answer him That makes a mock of me: For he shall see, that not in vain I have rely'd on thee. 3 Let him not say my words were false, When I my boast did make, That thou would'st judge my righteous cause, And come my part to take. 4 Then will I ever keep thy laws, Until my days expire: And freely walk in thy commands, Which is my whole desire. 5 I will not blush to speak of them To kings, and men of might: But count them still my chiefest joy, And all my hearts delight. 6 I earnestly will meditate On thy belov'd commands: And to the practice of the same, Will daily set my hands. VII. 1 Thy promise to thy servant made, Forget not, Lord, I pray: For thou hast caused me therein To set my hope and stay. 2 Thy word my greatest comfort is In all my grief and pain: For when my heart begins to faint, It brings my life again. 3 Though proud men mock'd, yet did not I Thy holy laws forsake: I thought upon thy ways of old, And thence did comfort take. 4 I tremble when I think upon The wicked and profane: How openly they break thy laws, And thy commands disdain. 5 Thy statutes, Lord, have been the songs, Wherewith my heart I chear, When like a pilgrim in this world, I travel here and there. 6 By night, O Lord, I think on thee, And when I call to mind: That I have kept thy precepts well, In this I comfort find. VIII. 1 My portion and inheritance, Thou only art, O Lord: And therefore I have promised That I would keep thy word. 2 Thy favour, Lord, with all my heart, I did most humbly crave: According therefore to thy word Let me thy mercy have. 3 I thought upon my former ways, And turned to thy will: I hasted and delayed not, Thy precepts to fulfil. 4 When wicked men in troops did come, To make of me a prey, No terrors did prevail with me, Thy laws to disobey. 5 At midnight I will rise, O Lord, Thy righteous laws to praise: And will companion be to none, But those that keep thy ways. 6 On every creature in the world Thou do'st thy gifts bestow: But let my portion be, O Lord, Thy holy will to know. IX. 1 Thou hast unto thy servant been Most bountiful and kind: According to thy promises, Thy mercy, Lord, I find. 2 Teach me, O Lord, and bend my heart To what is good and just: For in thy good and holy word I put my hope and trust. 3 Before that I afflicted was, I often went astray: But now I have observ'd thy word, And walked in thy way. 4 Lord, thou art infinitely good, And doest good to all. Instruct me in thy statutes then, That I may never fall. 5 The proud my false accusers were, But I will walk upright: And while in fat their hearts do swim, Thy laws are my delight. 6 This by affliction I have gain'd, To learn thy statutes well, Which gold and silver in their price A thousand times excel. X. 1 Thy hands have made me, and my shape, And fashion did bestow: Lord give me understanding too, That I thy laws may know. 2 All they that truly fear thy name, Will much rejoyce to see, That I have learned from thy word, To set my hope in thee. 3 Thy judgments, Lord, I know are right, And ever must confess, That thou hast now afflicted me In very faithfulness. 4 Now, Lord, according to thy word, Thy heavy hand remove: Have mercy, Lord, that I may live, And I thy laws will love. 5 Confound my proud and spiteful foes, That hate without a cause: And I will ever meditate On thy most holy laws. 6 Let those that know thee turn to me, And those that are sincere: And make me in thy statutes sound, That I no shame may fear. XI. 1 My soul for thy salvation faints, Yet hopes still in thy word: My eyes with expectation fail, And cry, how long, O Lord. 2 Like to a bottle in the smoke, My skin with grief is dri'd: Yet do I not forget thy laws, Nor from thy precepts slide. 3 How many, Lord, will be the days, E'er thou wilt favour shew, And send thy judgments on the heads Of them that me pursue? 4 The proud have digged pits for me, That wander from thy laws, Thy word is true: save me from those That hate without a cause. 5 They had almost consumed me, And rooted from the land: Yet did I not forsake thy law, Nor turn from thy command. 6 According to thy wonted love, Revive my drooping heart: So from the judgments of thy mouth I never will depart. XII. 1 Firm as the heavens is thy word, And stands forever sure, Thy faithfulness from age to age Shall stedfastly endure. 2 Even as the earth unmoved stands, And to this very day, Both heaven and earth thy orders keep, And thy command obey. 3 Had not thy law been my support, And all my hearts delight: So heavy my afflictions were, I must have perish'd quite. 4 Thy laws I never will forget, For they have quick'ned me: O save me, for I love thy word, And thine will ever be. 5 The wicked have been waiting long, That they might me destroy; But I have thought upon thy word, And that has been my joy. 6 Of all perfections in this world, I have observ'd an end: But the perfections of thy law, No thought can comprehend. XIII. 1 O how I love thy laws, O Lord! How sweet they are to me! I all the day can think of them, And never weary be. 2 By them thou hast me wiser made Than all mine enemies: For they are ever in my thoughts, And still before mine eyes. 3 My teachers I in knowledge pass, Yea ancients too excel: For on thy word I meditate, And keep thy precepts well. 4 All sinful ways I did refrain, Nor from thy precepts go: That so I might observe thy word, For thou hast taught me so. 5 How pleasant are thy words to me! In sweetness they surpass: So sweet unto my tast as they, No honey ever was. 6 I am enlightned by thy word, And with true knowledge blest: All falshood therefore I abhor, And sinful ways detest. XIV. 1 Thy word a lamp is to my feet, And to my path a light: And I, as I have sworn to do, Will keep thy judgments right. 2 I am afflicted very sore, Revive my soul, O Lord: Thy promise is to quicken me, O think upon thy word. 3 Accept the free-will offerings, And praises that I give: And by thy word enlighten me, And teach me how to live. 4 My life is ever in my hand, And snares for me are set: Yet do I not forsake thy laws, Nor once thy word forget. 5 Thy testimonies I account My sure inheritance: And at the very thought of them, My heart doth leap and dance. 6 My heart and mind unto thy laws, I did incline and bend, And ever will perform the same, Until my life shall end. XV. 1 I hate the men, whose thoughts are vain, But love thy laws most just: Thou art my shield and hiding place, And in thy word I trust. 2 Depart from me, ye wicked men, And get ye far away: For the commandments of my God, I purpose to obey. 3 According to thy promise, Lord, Let me supported be: And let me never be asham'd That I have hop'd in thee. 4 Uphold me and I shall be safe, And I thy laws will own: But wicked and deceitful men Shall all be trodden down. 5 The wicked thou wilt put away, And as vile dross despise: And for that very cause, O Lord, Thy word I highly prize. 6 When I consider thee, O Lord, My flesh doth fear and quake, To think what judgments are in store, For such as thee forsake. XVI. 1 I have upright and faithful been, Be surety, Lord, for me: And from my proud oppressors hands, Relieve and set me free. 2 With looking for deliverance, My eyes begin to fade: And for the faithful promises, Which thou to me hast made. 3 According to thy mercy, Lord, To me thy statutes shew: And make me know thy holy will, Who am thy servant true. 4 'Tis time for thee, O Lord, to work, And shew thy mighty hand: For wicked men make void thy low, And laugh at thy command. 5 But thy commandments I will love, And value still the more: I will esteem them more than gold, Yea finest golden oar. 6 Most highly will I prize thy word, Whose precepts are so pure: But hate the ways of wickedness, And no false ways endure. XVII. 1 The wisdom of thy holy laws Is wonderful and deep: Therefore my soul is fully bent, Most strictly them to keep. 2 The very entrance of thy word Affords so great a light: That simple ones may soon perceive Their minds grow clear and bright. 3 I long'd and panted for thy word; O smile upon me so, As unto them that love thy name, Thou usest, Lord to do. 4 My steps to order by thy word, Let me assistance have: And keep me, that prevailing sin May never me enslave. 5 From man's oppression rescue me, And I thy laws will do: O smile on me, and teach me, Lord, Thy holy will to know. 6 In gushing streams my tears run down, Like rivers from mine eyes; For grief to see how wicked men Thy righteous laws despise. XVIII. 1 O Lord thou art a God most just; Thy judgments are upright: Thy testimonies and commands Are faithful just and right. 2 I am with zeal almost consum'd, And set into a flame, To see thy enemies slight thy laws, And vilifie thy name. 3 Because thy word is very pure, Thy servant loveth it: And though I am despis'd and low, I will it not forget. 4 The equity of thy commands, Forever shall endure: Nor can thy precepts cease to be Most holy just and pure. 5 When troubles and afflictions come, And all upon me seize: Yet thy commands are my delight, And give me present ease. 6 Thy word is of eternal truth; O Lord, unto me give The understanding of thy law: Grant this, and I shall live. XIX. 1 To thee I cry'd, O Lord my God, And with my heart did pray: Hear me, O Lord and answer me, And I shall thee obey. 2 Before the dawning of the day, To thee, O Lord, I cry'd: And in the midst of all my grief, Upon thy word rely'd. 3 Yea in the watches of the night, Mine eyes were waking still, To meditate upon thy word, And understand thy will. 4 Then listen to my voice, O Lord, As thou art good and kind: According to thy promises, Revive my fainting mind. 5 The wicked ones draw near to me, That mischief still pursue: But thou art nearer, Lord, than they, And all thy words are true. 6 As to thy testimonies all, That in thy word are told, I know they are most firm and sure, And so have found of old. XX. 1 Behold my grief, and save me, Lord, For I observe thy laws: As thou hast promis'd, quicken me; Help, Lord, and plead my cause. 2 Safety is far from wicked men, Who thy commandments hate: But quicken me as thou art wont, And shew thy mercies great. 3 Although their numbers multiply, That at my ruine aim: Thy testimonies to observe, My zeal shall be the same. 4 I view'd the lives of wicked men, And sorely did lament, That they to break thy holy laws, Were all so fully bent. 5 Consider, Lord, what fervent love To thy commands I bear: And after thy compassions great My fainting spirits chear. 6 From the beginning of the world, Thy word was true and sure: Thy judgments to the end thereof, Most firmly shall endure. XXI. 1 Though princes did my life pursue, And that without a cause: My heart, O Lord, doth stand in aw Of nothing but thy laws. 2 I at thy holy word rejoyce, As one that spoils doth find: I lies abhor, but love thy law With all my heart and mind. 3 So righteous are thy judgments all, That I will them proclaim: And set my self seven times a day To praise thy holy name. 4 Great is the peace which thou do'st give To them that love thy laws: Whatever in this world they meet, It shall no trouble cause. 5 For thy salvation, Lord, I hope, And thy commands have done: I love them all exceedingly, And keep them every one. 6 Thy testimonies and thy laws I keep most faithfully: For all my ways were in the sight Of thine all-seeing eye. XXII. 1 O let my cry before thee come, And hear the prayer I make: I ask for wisdom: grant it, Lord, For thy good promise sake. 2 O let my supplications all, Presented be to thee: And as thy word has promised, O Lord, deliver me. 3 When thou hast me thy statutes taught, My lips shall speak thy praise: My joyful tongue shall celebrate Thy word and holy ways. 4 Help me, O Lord to walk aright, Who make thy laws my choice: For I for thy salvation long, And in thy word rejoyce. 5 Revive my weak and fainting soul, And I shall thankful be: And let thy word continually Direct and comfort me. 6 Lord, I have gone astray from thee, Much like a wandring sheep: Seek me, O Lord, and bring me back, And I thy laws will keep. Psalm CXX. 1 O Lord, who in my deep distress, Has often heard my cry: Now save me from deceitful lips, And tongues that love to lie. 2 What shall be given thee, O false tongue? What judgment shalt thou bear? Sharp arrows of the mighty one, With coals of Juniper. 3 O Wo is me, that I must live With Mesech's wicked race: And in the tents of Kedar dwell, That vile and cursed place. 4 My soul has long been forc'd to dwell With those that peace abhor: I am for peace; but when I speak, Then they are all for war. 2 Metre. 1 In trouble and distress, To God I did address, And he did hear my cry: Now Lord deliver me From lips that feigning be, And tongues that love to lie. 2 What shall to thee be done, Thou false and flattering tongue? What judgment shalt thou bear? Sharp arrows from the throne Of the Almighty one, With coals of Juniper. 3 How woful is my case, I have no dwelling place, But Mesech's wicked land: And must constrained be To Kedar's tents to flee, Amongst a cursed band. 4 My soul too long doth dwell, Full sore against her will, With those that peace do hate: For peace I often move, But nothing they approve But mischief and debate. Psalm CXXI. 1 Shall I look up to mountains high? Or doth my help proceed from thence? The Lord that made the earth and sky, 'Tis he alone is my defence. 2 Thy feet, O Israel shall not slide, For he still wakes, who thee doth keep: He is thy guard on every side, Whose watchful eyes can never sleep. 3 The Lord will keep thee safe and sound, So that no evil thee shall smite, While sun by day doth go his round, Or while the moon doth rule the night. 4 He will defend thee round about, And keep by his almighty power, Thy coming in and going out, From this time forth for evermore. Psalm CXXII. 1 O how my heart did leap to hear That sweet and joyful word, Come let us all go up and see The temple of the Lord. 2 Our feet, O dear Jerusalem, Within thy gates shall stand; The sweetest place and best compact Of any in the land. 3 Hither the tribe together come, The tribes of God the Lord; To render thanks unto his name, And hear his holy word. 4 Here are the thrones of judgment set, All causes to decide: And here the house of David reigns, Which ever shall abide. 5 Pray for the peace and happiness Of this Jerusalem: For they that love and pray for her, The Lord will prosper them. 6 All peace and blessings be in thee: This prayer I will make; For love I to my brethren bear, And dear companions sake. 7 But though I love thee for the sake Of friends and brethren dear: Yet chiefly do I wish thy good, Because God's house is there. 2 Metre. 1 O how my heart did chear, That joyful word to hear, Come let us in God's temple meet; Happy is it for them, O dear Jerusalem, That in thy gates may set their feet. 2 Jerusalem that neat, And well compacted seat, Where all the tribes to meet are bound, The tribes of God the Lord, To hear his holy word, And sing his praise with joyful sound. 3 There courts of equity, All causes sit to try, And David's throne is seated there: Pray for Jerusalem, For God will prosper them That unto her affection bear. 4 All peace and plenty be, For evermore in thee, For my dear friends and brethrens sake: But for the house of God, Where he hath his abode, I chiefly do this prayer make. Psalm CXXIII. 1 To thee, O Lord, I lift mine eyes, Who do'st in heaven dwell: Even as the eyes of servants look, And mind their masters well. 2 And as upon her mistress' hands, The maidens eyes attend: So we upon the Lord our God, Till he shall mercy send. 3 Have mercy, then, have mercy, Lord, For we are vilifi'd By those that wallow in their wealth, And live in pomp and pride. Psalm CXXIV. 1 Now Israel may well and truly cry, If that the Lord had not been on our side; If that the Lord to help us had deni'd, When men rose up against us furiously We had been lost beyond recovery. 2 For certain then we had been all undone, And us alive our enemies had devour'd; Such was their rage, and such their mighty power; Like swelling floods they over us had gone: So very near was our destruction. 3 The waters proud whose threatning waves did roar, Had overwhelm'd, and drown'd us in the deep: But our good God did us in safety keep, From cruel teeth of such as would devour; His holy name be praised evermore. 4 Even as a bird the fowlers snare doth break, And flies away; so we delivered were: The snare is broke, and we escaped are: The mighty God that heaven and earth did make, He only sav'd us for his mercies sake. 2 Metre. 1 Had not the Lord been on our side, May Israel now confess: Had not the Lord been on our side, When we were in distress: 2 We had been swallowed up alive, When men against us rose: So very great the fury was, And power of our foes. 3 The waters deep had overwhelm'd, And drown'd us every one: The waters proud had swallow'd us, And over us had gone. 4 But blessed be our gracious God, Who sav'd us from their power: Nor left us for a prey to them, That cruelly devour. 5 We are escaped as a bird, Out of the fowlers snare: The snare is now in pieces broke, And we escaped are. 6 Our help is in the name of God, Who heaven and earth did make: He only hath delivered us, For his great mercies sake. Psalm CXXV. 1 All they that build their confidence Upon the Lord above, Shall stand as firm as Sion hill, Which nothing can remove. 2 And as the mountains round about, Defend Jerusalem: So is the Lord about his flock, To help and succour them. 3 He will not let the wickeds rod Upon his people stay: Lest through despair of his relief They faint and fall away. 4 Thy grace and bounty, Lord, extend To all that faithful are: And let thy blessings ever dwell With those that are sincere. 5 But such as walk in crooked ways, Refusing to do well: Give them as wicked men deserve, But peace to Israel. 2 Metre. 1 All they that in the Lord above, Have set their hope most firm and sure, Like Sion hill shall never move, But shall for evermore endure. As mountains stout, that stand about, Defend and keep Jerusalem: So is the Lord his peoples guard, On every side to succour them. 2 For he is such a gracious God, And his compassions are so strong, He will not let the wicked's rod Upon his people lie too long. Lest being frail, their hearts should fail, And through despair and misery, From God should stray and fall away To courses of iniquity. 3 Lord, let thy blessings still abide With those whose hearts are true and right: But as for them that turn aside, And in their crooked ways delight; Lord number those among thy foes, And let their portion be to dwell Amongst that train, in endless pain, But Lord send peace to Israel. Psalm CXXVI. 1 When us from our captivity, The Lord to Zion brought: We scarce believ'd, but took it all To be a dream, or thought. 2 But soon our doubt to laughter turn'd, And then by every tongue, What things the Lord had done for us In joyful songs were sung. 3 Yea ev'n the heathens notice took, And did confess the same: The Lord hath done great things for us, For which we bless his name. 4 Those captives that are still behind, Lord bring them with the rest: Their coming will like rivers be Unto the wilderness. 5 Who sow in tears shall reap with joy; As when with heavy chear The husbandman doth sow his seed, Because it cost him dear. 6 But when the welcome harvest comes, For which he hop'd so long, He carries home his sheaves with joy, And sings the harvest song. Psalm CXXVII. 1 Except the Lord doth build the house, It cannot long remain: Except the Lord the city keeps, The watchman wakes in vain. 2 In vain men hope by rising soon, Or sitting up so late, Or eating course and sorry bread To raise a great estate. 3 For riches from the Lord proceed, His blessing makes us thrive: Though we of our convenient rest, Do not our selves deprive. 4 See, children are an heritage Which God alone bestows: Posterity a blessing is, Which from his bounty grows. 5 Children of youth like arrows are, Shot by a strong mans arm: For they defend a family. And save a house from harm. 6 The man whose quiver stored is With such Artillery, Shall meet his enemies in the gate, And boldly them defie. 2 Metre. 1 Except the Lord a family Be pleas'd to build, and to maintain; All our endeavours are but vain: Nor is it less a vanity, Cities and Forts to watch and ward, Except the Lord will be their guard. 2 In vain it is to rise betime, And then at night go late to bed, Feeding on course and sorry bread, That we to great estates may climb: For they shall thrive whom God hath blest Although they take convenient rest. 3 And know it to be no less true, That children from the Lord do come His blessing makes a fruitful womb; To him alone the praise is due Who doth bestow most graciously, A numerous posterity. 4 Nor do we less his blessing see, When sons of youth grow up and thrive Till they to perfect strength arrive; So that they may compared be To arrows in a giants hand, Both to annoy, and to defend. 5 Happy the man whose quiver is Furnish'd with such artillery: For they support a family; And with so brave a guard as this, Undauntedly he shall oppose, And in the gate confront his foes. Psalm CXXVIII. 1 Blessed are they that fear the Lord, And turn not from his way: For they shall of their labours eat; O happy sure are they. 2 Like to the vines about thy house, Thy wife shall fruitful be: Like olive-plants about thy board, Thy children thou shalt see. 3 See, thus the Lord shall prosper thee, Who walkest in his fear: And blessings out of Zion send, Which thou hast asked there. 4 Yea thou shalt see Jerusalem To thrive and prosper well: Thy childrens children thou shalt see, And peace on Israel. Psalm CXXIX. 1 Oft from my youth they me opprest, May Israel say with joy: Oft from my youth they me opprest, But never could destroy. 2 The plowers plow'd upon my back, And made their furrows long: The righteous Lord hath cut the cords Of that ungodly throng. 3 Confound them, Lord, that Zion hate, And blast them with thy frown: As corn upon the houses tops, That dies before 'tis grown. 4 Of which the reaper cannot find, Enough to fill his hand: Nor yet the binder of the sheaves To put into a band. 5 On which his blessing to bestow, No traveller will deign: Nor once to say, God speed your work, Upon such labour vain. Psalm CXXX. 1 From depths of sorrow and distress To thee, O Lord, I cry: O lend an ear to my complaint, And hear me speedily. 2 If thou should'st mark iniquity, O Lord, who shall appear? But mercy, Lord, with thee is found, That men thy name may fear. 3 My soul, O Lord, doth wait for thee, And in thy promise hope: As they that watch in tedious nights, Till morning light doth ope. 4 Let Israel still hope in God, In whom all mercy lies: And he will his redeemer be From his iniquities. Psalm CXXXI. 1 O Lord, I am not proud in heart; I have no lofty eye: Nor do I exercise my self In things that are too high. 2 But as a child that weaned is, And taken from the breast: So have I, Lord, behav'd my self In quietness and rest. 3 And let the people every where, That Israel's God adore, Observe and learn to trust in him, Both now and evermore. Psalm CXXXII. 1 Remember David's troubles, Lord, How to the Lord he swore: And vow'd a vow to Jacob's God, The God of might and power. 2 I will not come into my house, Nor climb into my bed: Nor sleep will give unto mine eyes, Nor slumber to mine head. 3 Till I have found a decent place, In which the Lord may dwell: A habitation that may please The God of Jacob well. 4 We heard of it at Ephratah, And in the woods have found: And now into his tents will go, And worship to the ground. 5 Arise, O Lord, into thy rest: Thou and that ark of thine, From whence thy mighty power appears, And majesty divine. 6 Let righteousness the garment be, Wherewith thy priests are clad: And let thy saints with shouting sing, And be exceeding glad. 7 Remember now thy promise, Lord, Thou did'st to David make: Reject not thine anointed king For thy dear servants sake. 8 The Lord hath thus to David sworn, And will not turn from it: Thy children that from thee proceed, Upon thy throne shall sit. 9 And if they keep my covenant, And laws that I shall frame: Their children too from age to age Shall sit upon the same. 10 For God has chosen Zion hill, And there desires to dwell: This is, said he, my resting place, I love and like it well. 11 Her stores I will with plenty bless, And bounteously provide: So that her poor shall want no bread, But shall be satisfi'd. 12 Her priests arrai'd in robes of joy, Shall my salvation praise: And all her saints in highest notes Their joyful voices raise. 13 The horn of David there shall bud, His princely race shall spring: His lamp shall never be extinct. Nor house shall want a king. 14 Confusion shall the garment be Of all his enemies: But his dominion ever last, And still in glory rise. Psalm CXXXIII. 1 Behold how good and sweet it is, And pleasant sight to see, When brethren with each other live In perfect unity! 2 Sweet as the ointment that was pour'd On Aaron's sacred head: Which running down perfum'd his beard, And on his garments spred. 3 On such the Lord will blessings send, As numberless to count, As drops of dew on Zion hill, Or Hermon's stately mount. 4 Yea out of Zion he will add One blessing to their store, That shall compleat and crown the rest, Even life for evermore. Psalm CXXXIV. 1 Ye servants of the Lord, Whose place it is by right, Within the house of God to stand, And praise him every night. 2 Attend upon your charge, And magnifie his grace: And lift up pure and holy hands, In his most holy place. 3 Then he that all things made, His Zion will defend: And will from thence upon his flock Eternal blessings send. Psalm CXXXV. 1 O All ye servants of the Lord, Exalt his glorious name: And ye that in his temple stand Extol and praise the same. 2 Praise ye the Lord, for he is good, And to his name to sing In joyful songs, and psalms of praise, It is a pleasant thing. 3 He for a treasure to himself Hath chosen Israel: He is the great and mighty Lord, Who doth all God's excel. 4 The Lord has done in every place, What he was pleas'd to do: Both in the heavens and the earth, And in the ocean too. 5 He makes the vapours that ascend, The lightnings, and the rain: 'Tis he that treasures up the winds, And brings them out again. 6 The first born both of man and beast, The Lord in Egypt slew: And did on Pharaoh and his host, His mighty wonders shew. 7 He smote great nations, with their kings, That did to them belong: As Sihon King of Amorites, And Og the giant strong. 8 And all the kingdoms, where the race Of Canaanites did dwell, He gave for an inheritance Unto his Israel. 9 Thy name most glorious ever was In generations past: And to the ages yet to come, Thy mighty fame shall last. 10 For thou, O Lord, will never fail, Thy peoples cause to plead: But pity them in their distress, And help them in their need. 11 The heathen gods are idols vain, Which workmens hands did make: Their gold and silver images Have mouths, but cannot speak. 12 And eyes they have, but cannot see, And ears but cannot hear: And nostrils too by art contriv'd, But breath was never there. 13 Their makers are as dull as they, And understand no more: And so are all that trust in them, And such blind gods adore. 14 Let Israel and Aaron's house, And all of Levi's line; And every one that fears the Lord To bless the Lord combine. 15 And let them all in Zion meet, His glorious praises tell: And in his own Jerusalem, Where he delights to dwell. Psalm CXXXVI. 1 Give thanks unto the Lord, For he is good and kind: And let him be ador'd With all your heart and mind. For certainly His mercy shall Endure to all Eternity. 2 O praise the God of Gods, And ever to him sing: Extol the Lord of Lords, And make his praises ring. For certainly, &amp;c. 3 To him and him alone, All praise and glory be: By whom alone are done The wonders that we see. For certainly, &amp;c. 4 Who by his skill divine, Did frame the heavens high: And stretch'd the earth by line, Above the seas to lie. For certainly, &amp;c. 5 To him who did display Those glorious lamps of light: The sun to rule by day, The moon and stars by night. For certainly, &amp;c. 6 Who all the first-born slew That were in Egypt's land: And out his people drew By his almighty hand. For certainly, &amp;c. 7 To him by whom the sea Divided was in two: And so was made a way For Israel to go. For certainly, &amp;c. 8 To him who drowned quite, Both Pharaoh and his host: And led his people right, Along the desart coast. For certainly, &amp;c. 9 To him by whom great kings Were slain and smitten down: Yea very famous kings, And men of great renown. For certainly, &amp;c. 10 Sihon who rul'd among The Amorites with his train; And Og the giant strong, That did in Bashan reign. For certainly, &amp;c. 11 Who did bestow their lands On those of Jacob's race, For their inheritance, And fixed dwelling place. For certainly, &amp;c. 12 Who hath upon us thought, In our afflicted state: And from the bondage bought Of those that did us hate. For certainly, &amp;c. 13 Who to all flesh doth bring The food by which they live: Unto his heavenly king All thanks and praises give. For certainly, &amp;c. Psalm CXXXVII. 1 With pensive heart, in Babylon, By mournful rivers side, We sat, and on our Zion thought, Till tears began to slide. 2 Our pleasant harps we laid aside, As useless in our grief: And hung them on the willow trees, Despairing of relief. 3 Then they to whom we prisoners were, Did thus deriding say. Come sing us one of Zion's songs, And on your musick play. 4 Alas, said we, how can we sing The songs that you demand; When we are in captivity, And banish'd from our land? 5 No, no, my dear Jerusalem, Since thou art lost and gone: 'Tis time my hand should lose her skill To play as she had done. 6 'Tis time my tongue should silent be, And from all mirth refrain, Until the day she sings for joy That thou art built again. 7 Remember Edom's sons, O Lord, Who in that dismal day, On which our city taken was, Did thus cry out and say. 8 Down with her quite, and raise her walls Unto the very ground: That so her name and memory May never more be found. 9 O Babylon, for ruine mark'd, The time will shortly be, When just as thou hast done by us, So men shall do by thee. 10 Ans as the cruel hands have dash'd Our babes against the stones: Happy the man that does the same Unto thy little ones. Psalm CXXXVIII. 1 Thee will I praise with all my heart, And magnifie thy name: Before the presence of the Gods I will exhalt the same. 2 Towards thy temple I will look, And adoration make: I will extol thee for thy truth, And for thy mercies sake. 3 Thou Lord hast magnifi'd thy word, For when I cri'd to thee, Thou did'st a gracious answer make, And thou did'st strenghten me. 4 All Kings, when they shall hear thy words, Thy praises shall repeat: And in thy ways shall sing to thee, Whose glory is so great. 5 For though the Lord in heaven dwells, The humble he doth love: But from his sight the arrogant, And proud man will remove. 6 In trouble thou wilt me revive, And stretch thy mighty hand, To save me, and to stop the rage Of them that me withstand. 7 Lord perfect what thou hast begun; Thy mercies never fade: Forsake me not a creature poor, Which thine own hands have made. Psalm CXXXIX. 1 Thou searchest, Lord, and knowest me, To thee all things are bare, My lying down, my rising up, My thoughts before they are. 2 My words and all my ways are known, My secret acts are found: Thy hand can reach me every where, Thine eye besets me round. 3 This knowledge is too wonderful For me to comprehend: So high above my highest reach Thy wisdom doth ascend. 4 How shall I from thy spirit go, Which every thing doth see? Thy presence filleth every place; Then whither shall I flee? 5 If I to heaven should ascend; Thou sittest there on high: If down to hell; even hell it self Is naked to thine eye. 6 If I as swift as morning light, should fly beyond the main: Thy mighty hand can reach me there, And fetch me back again. 7 If I in darkness hide my self; The night to thee doth shine: Darkness and light are both alike To those pure eyes of thine. 8 My reins and all my inward parts, By thee created were: When I was in my mothers womb, Thou did'st protect me there. 9 I cannot but admire, O Lord, Thy most amazing art, Whereby my body was compos'd, And wrought in every part. 10 When I was formed in the womb, Thou did'st my substance see: My members in thy book were writ, And shaped all by thee. 11 How precious are thy thoughts to me! To what a sum they mount! If I pretend to reckon them, It is in vain to count. 12 The very sands upon the shoar May sooner counted be: For every morning I awake, Lord I am still with thee. 13 But thou wilt slay the wicked man; Depart, ye bloody train: That wickedly blaspheme the Lord, And take his name in vain. 14 Hate I not them that hate the Lord, And up against him rise? Yes, Lord, I hate them perfectly, And count mine enemies. 15 Search me, O God, and know my heart, And if I do amiss: O lead me in the way that goes To everlasting bliss. Psalm CXL. 1 From violent and ungodly men, O Lord preserve my life: That mischief in their hearts contrive, And meet for war and strife. 2 Their tongue is like a serpents sting, Some mischief still to work: The deadly poison of the snake, Within their lips doth lurk. 3 Lord keep me from those wicked hands, And from the violent man: Whose purpose is to overthrow My goings, if he can. 4 The proud have hid a snare for me, And nets before me laid: But hear me, for thou art my God; Thus to the Lord I said. 5 O God the Lord, Who art my strength, And hast salvation wrought; By whom my head protected was, When I in battle fought. 6 Grant not the pray'rs of wicked men, Nor let them have their will: Lest their success should puff them up, And make them prouder still. 7 Lord make their lips to be their snare, That cruel plots devise: Consume and cast them into pits, That they may never rise. 8 Let them not prosper in the earth, That in false tales delight: Evil shall hunt the violent man, And overthrow him quite. 9 But thou wilt plead the poor man's cause, And wilt defend him well: The upright then shall praise thy name, And in thy presence dwell. Psalm CLXI. 1 To thee I cry; make hast, O Lord, And listen to my cries: And let my prayer as incense be, Or evening sacrifice. 2 Lord, set a watch before my lips, And keep this door of mine: Nor let my heart at any time To evil things incline. 3 Let me not join with wicked men, Nor of their dainties eat: But let the righteous me reprove; The kindness will be great. 4 Like oil it shall not break my head, But rather heal the wound: And in distress to pray for them I shall be ever bound. 5 When from the rocks their judges fall, That should the rest defend: I will most sweet and fervent pray'rs For them to heaven send. 6 Our bones about the graves are spread, As chips by hewers thrown: But still I look and trust to thee; O leave me not alone. 7 Keep me from snares of wicked men, Which for my life they lay: Let them be taken in their nets, Whilst I escape away. Psalm CXLII. 1 I earnestly to God did cry, To him I made my prayer: I pour'd out my complaint to him, And did my grief declare. 2 When I was overwhelm'd with grief, Thou did'st observe and see, How in my path they secretly Had laid a snare for me. 3 On my right hand I look'd for help, But no man would appear: All refuge fail'd and there was none That for my soul did care. 4 But, Lord, I cri'd to thee, and said, Thou art my refuge sure: Thou art my portion, and my lot, While life and breath endure. 5 Lord I am brought exceeding low, O listen to my cry: Save me from them that me pursue, Who stronger are than I. 6 From prison, Lord, deliver me, That I may bless thy name: The righteous then shall round me come, And praise thee for the same. Psalm CXLIII. 1 Give ear unto my cries, O Lord, And to my prayer attend: And in thy mercy and thy truth A gracious answer send. 2 And into judgment enter not; For were we strictly tri'd: Nor I nor any man alive Could then be jnstifi'd. 3 Mine enemies pursue my life, And smite me to the ground: I am like those that lie in graves, And dead long since are found. 4 My spirit, Lord, is overwhelm'd, My heart is desolate: Yet on the wondrous works of old I muse and meditate. 5 To thee, O Lord in my distress I criy and stretch my hands: My soul for thee as thirsty is, As dry and thirsty lands. 6 Hear me with speed; my spirit fails: Hide not thy face, I crave. Thy frowns, O Lord, will strike me dead, And send me to my grave. 7 Cause me to hear thy mercy soon, For I on thee rely: Shew me the way that I should walk, To thee, O Lord, I cry. 8 O save me, for I flee to thee; Be thou my hiding place: With thy good spirit me instruct, And lead me by thy grace. 9 For thy most holy name, O Lord, Revive and quicken me; And for thy truth and righteousness, From trouble set me free. 10 And of thy mercy cut them off, Against me that combine: Destroy them all that vex my soul, For I am only thine. Psalm CXLIV. 1 For ever blessed be the Lord, Who is my strength and might: For he instructs my hands to war, And fingers how to fight. 2 My comforter, my fortress strong, My saviour and my tower: My shield, my trust, and he by whom I am a conqueror. 3 Lord, what is man, I well may say, That thou shoul'dst notice take? Or son of man that thou of him So great account dost make? 4 Vain man to vanity it self, Compare we justly may: Whose days like fleeting shadows are, That quickly pass away. 5 Lord bow the heavens, and come down, And make the mountains smoke: Like arrows shoot thy lightnings out, And slay them with thy stroke. 6 Send, Lord, and save me from the floods; That strange and wicked race. Whose words are nothing else but lies, And actions false and base. 7 Then will I sing new songs to thee Upon the psaltery: And on ten stringed instruments Thy name will magnifie. 8 To him all kings their safety owe, And all their victories: Who sav'd his servant David's life From all his enemies. 9 Now save me from those children strange, Whose tongues in lies delight: Nor do they exercise their hands In doing what is right. 10 And bless us all, that so our sons Like thriving plants may be: Our daughters like the polish'd stones, In palaces we see. 11 Our garners may be stor'd with corn, And all good things beside: To thousands and ten thousand too Our flocks be multipli'd. 12 Our oxen may be stout and strong, Their labour to maintain: No breaking in, nor going out, Nor any that complain. 13 Happy the people that are thus With peace and plenty stor'd: Yea rather happy they that are The people of the Lord. Psalm CXLV. 1 Thee will I praise, my God, and King And ever bless thy name: From day to day I will extol, And magnifie the same. 2 Great is the Lord, and great his praise; His power exceeds our thought: One age shall to anorher tell What wonders he hath wrought. 3 I first will of thy honour speak, And wondrous works declare: Then men shall answer me and shew How terrible they were. 4 And I again will shew the power Of thee our mighty king: And they at large thy goodness great, And righteousness shall sing. 5 The Lord is kind and merciful, To anger he is slow: But over all that he has made His tender mercies flow. 6 Thy works shall all declare thy praise, Thy saints thy name shall bless: And of thy glorious kingdom speak, And mighty power confess. 7 That men may know thy mighty acts, And greatness of thy throne: And that thy glorious kingdom is An everlasting one. 8 The Lord his people will uphold, That ready are to fall: And when afflictions bow them down, The Lord will raise them all. 9 The eyes of all things wait on thee, In season for their food: Thou openest thy hand to them, And fillest them with good. 10 The Lord in all his works and ways, Is holy just and right: And near to all that call on him With hearts and minds upright. 11 The Lord will the desire fulfil Of them that fear his name: And in distress will hear their cry, And will perform the same. 12 All those that him sincerely love, The Lord will keep and save: But wicked and ungodly men Shall sure destruction have. 13 My mouth shall never cease to speak The praise of God most high: And let all flesh exalt his name To all eternity. Psalm CXLVI. 1 Praise ye the Lord; and thou my soul For ever praise his name: As long as life and breath shall last, I will extol the same. 2 Trust not in prinees: for in man It is in vain to trust; Whose thoughts and he together die, And perish in the dust. 3 O blest is he whose hope and help In Jacob's God doth stand: Who made the world, and all therein, By his almighty hand. 4 Who keeps his word, and saves the poor, When they oppressed be: Who to the hungry giveth food, And sets the prisoner free. 5 The Lord reftores the blind their sight, And lifts up them that fall: In righteous men the Lord delights, And loves them best of all. 6 The widow and the fatherless, And stranger he will keep: But overturn the wicked man In all his plots so deep. 7 The Lord, O Zion, still shall reign, Thy God that dwells in thee: His kingdom shall for ever stand; To him all glory be. Psalm CXLVII. 1 Praise ye the Lord, for it is good, Unto our God to sing: And to exalt his holy name, A sweet and comely thing. 2 The Lord will surely build again His own Jerusalem: And the disperst of Israel The Lord will gather them. 3 He heals the broken in their hearts, Their wounds he bindeth well: He counts the number of the stars, And all their names can tell. 4 Great is the Lord, and great his power, His knowledge has no bound: He loves to raise the humble man, And cast the wicked down. 5 Sing to the Lord upon the harp, In sweet and pleasant strain; Who overspreads the heaven with clouds, And so prepares the rain. 6 'Tis he that makes the grass to grow Upon the mountains high: He feeds the beasts; and he relieves Young ravens, when they cry. 7 In strength of horse, or legs of man, The Lord doth not delight; But they that fear and trust in him, Are pleasant in his sight. 8 O praise the Lord, Jerusalem, O Zion do no less: Who fortifi'd thy gates with bars, And did thy children bless. 9 He sends thee peace in all thy coasts, That all is calm and still: And with the finest of the wheat He doth thy garners fill, 10 He does but only give command, And streight the order flies: The snow like wool about is spread, And frost like ashes lies. 11 His ice like morsels out is cast, And bitter cold is felt: But when he speaks, the wind is turn'd, And all begins to melt. 12 His word to Jacob he declar'd, And statutes did relate: His judgments all to Israel He did communicate. 13 There is no nation in the world, That has enjoy'd his word: Nor known his laws as they have done, Wherefore praise ye the Lord. Psalm CXLVIII. 1 Unto the Lord give praise From heaven that is so high: His fame and glory raise Above the starry sky. Begin the song, Ye regal band, That round him stand, Of angels strong. 2 Praise him both sun and moon That rule the day and night: The same of you be done, Ye glistering stars of light. And ye no less, O heavens fair, And clouds of the air, His praise express. 3 For they at his command, Were formed as we see: And shall for ever stand By force of his decree. For them to guide, A law he made, That shall not fade, But still abide. 4 Ye dragons of the deep, Ye seas and every whale That in the ocean keep, To praise him do not fail. Ye lightnings too, Hail, vapours, snow, And storms that blow, His will to do. 5 Ye hills and mountains all, And trees that fruitful are Ye Cedars great and tall, His glorious praise declare. Beasts wild, and tame, Each fowl of wing, And creeping thing Do ye the same. 6 All Kings and Potentates His glorious praises sound: All Princes, Realms and States, That in the world are found. To sing his praise Young Men and Maids, Old Men and Babes Your voices raise. 7 Exalted be his Name, And had in high account, Whose Glory and his fame Both heaven and earth surmount. To us he rais'd Salvations horn, As he had sworn, His Name be prais'd. 8 His Saints aloud shall sing, And shew his praise divine; The children that shall spring, And come of Jacob's line. Yea they also Afar that were, Shall be made near, And praise him too. Psalm CXLIX. 1 Sing praises to the Lord our God, New Songs unto him sing: In great Assemblies of his Saints O make his praise to ring. 2 Let Israel in him rejoice, Whose hands did him create: The praises of her heavenly King Let Zion celebrate. 3 With dancing let them shew their joy, With harp and timbrel praise: For in his people he delights, And will the humble raise. 4 Let Saints triumph, and on their beds, Sing loud unto the Lord: And let them carry in their hands A double edged Sword. 5 To execute his vengeance great Upon the Heathen lands: To bind their kings in fetters strong, Their Lords in iron bands. 6 To execute those heavy plagues Recorded in his word: This honour all his saints shall have, Wherefore praise ye the Lord. Psalm CL. 1 All praise in his most holy place, Unto the Lord present, Who in his temple sits enthron'd, As in the firmament. 2 His mighty wonders celebrate, His glorious acts proclaim: With trumpet, harp and psaltery Exalt his holy name. 3 Praise him with timbrel and with pipe, In sweetest melody: Organs and stringed instruments, And cymbals loud and high. 5 Let every thing to whom the Lord The gift of breath doth send, Employ it all in praising him, Till life and breath shall end. 2. Metre. 1 All praise unto the Lord alone In his most holy place present: Who in his temple sits enthron'd, As in the heavenly firmament. 2 His mighty wonders magnifie, According to his great renown: With trumpet, harp and psaltery, O make his glorious praise be known 3 His praise with pipe and timbrel shew, Organs and instruments with strings With loud and lofty cymbals too, O praise this glorious king of kings. 4 Let every thing that breath enjoys, Since God alone bestow'd the same: Employ it all in giving praise, And ever bless his holy name. Gloria Patri, &amp;c. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One God in Persons three; Who was, and is, and is to come, All praise and glory be. 2. Metre. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One God alone, in Persons three; Who was, and is, and is to come, To him all praise and glory be. FINIS.</field>
