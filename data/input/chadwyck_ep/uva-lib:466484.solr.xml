      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO MRS. BRYDGES, OF ST. LAWRENCE HOUSE, NEAR CANTERBURY. O thou, whose care o'er all my life presides, Whose hand supports me, and whose judgment guides; From jocund parties of the noisy bar, From crowds, and unendearing circles far, Pleas'd to whose cheerful roof I steal away, In sweet domestic bliss to pass my day! (For what wild joys, what flattery can supply The tender watchings of a Mother's eye?) Beneath thy smiles I catch poetic fire, And strike with rapt'rous hand my echoing lyre! For Thou without contempt my faults dost bear, Tho' oft unmeaning they have drawn thy tear, My ill-tim'd ardors, and my scorn to raise On the soft arts, that grace the world, my praise; Whilst wild Ambition leads my hopes astray, To draw attention to the simple lay, Which strives the Fancy's visions to impart, Or wake the slumb'ring feelings of the heart. Vain hope! For to the most neglected string Of the neglected lyre I dare to sing. Yet these wild wishes, free from blame, or scorn, With all their train of follies hast thou borne; To whom but thee, my Mother, then belongs The small requital of my humble songs? Middle Temple, April 5, 1785. INVOCATION TO POETRY. Aug. 14, 1782. O thou, the darling of my infant choice, With eyes that catch their radiance from above, Wild Maid, whose lucid looks and varied voice To rapture raise, or melt me into love! Of power at once to charm and to refine, To lull the tortur'd breast to pleasing sighs, Mid life's thick glooms to shed a light divine, Arise, Immortal Poesy, arise! Thou hear'stâand lo! the misty veil withdraws; From thy green bower thou lift'st thy laurell'd head, And bidst the vision'd scenes of slumber pause, Till on thy rosy couch again thy limbs are laid. Around thy waist the thin robe loosely bind, And let not coy excuse thy steps retard, Up yonder misty hill with me to wind, And see the golden gates of Morn unbarr'd. But when the heavens with noontide splendor glow; O then, as stretch'd beneath the shade, we hear On airy harp the Zephyrs wake their woe, Whisper some soothing love-tale in mine ear! Nor fail with me to watch the kindling skies, When the Sun's parting beams are ling'ring there, And view the clouds in shadowy castles rise, Till ravish'd fancy all their glories share! Or when the pale Moon sheds her milder light, To tread the green in melancholy mood, Marking each landscape soften'd to my sight, Each sound, that startles air with echo rude! But let us lie, sweet nymph, at midnight hour, And hear far off the howling storm complain, Till my lull'd senses stealing sleep o'erpower, And dreams of fame immortal soothe my brain! SONNETS. It has been the fashion of late to despise Sonnets, more especially those, which, on account of the technical repetition, and contexture, of the rhymes, are called legitimate. All the early portion of the following were written and published at a time when this sort of composition was not common; and few had been offered to the public, since the close of queen Elizabeth's reign, but those of Milton, in the time of Charles I. and those of Mr. Thomas Warton in 1777, and Mr. John Bampfylde in 1778. Some excellent translations of this kind appeared soon afterwards in the elegant, learned, and interesting notes of Mr. Hayley's poetical Epistles on Epic Poetry. What I now reprint, first appeared in March 1785. But in the preceding spring were given to the world, under this title, the first enchanting Poems of the late Mrs. Charlotte Smith, which I never saw, till after my own were printed: they did not adhere to the strict rules of this kind of metre; but perhaps they were the better for it; for they possessed that freedom and ease, which it is scarce possible to preserve while entangled by the complicated rules of the ancient sonnet. For my own part, it was, while at Cambridge, in my twentieth year, that constantly poring over Milton, and increasing in my admiration of his early poems, from the impotent attempt of Johnson to decry them, I proceeded from that admiration to a rash effort to imitate those simply-majestic productions in this way, which the great critic with such rude and unfeeling sarcasm had condemned to utter contempt. How I succeeded, considering my age, and other circumstances, my readers have long had an opportunity of judging, if they have thought it worth a judgment. At this distance of time I can myself perceive, that I was not able to conquer the stiffness, which this sort of metre generally causes. SONNET I. The sentiments contained in this Sonnet, however inadequately expressed, were perfectly sincere. While many of the author's friends appeared dissatisfied with his surrendering himself to so romantic a pursuit as that of poetry, he was anxious to justify himself both to his own conscience, and to the few, whose opinion he most regarded. He had well-wishers, who looked to a career for him of more ostentatious ambition; who thought that his humble talents were wasted, except in the chase of wealth and honours; and who expected from him therefore an application to more useful and better-rewarded studies; but they forgot what Cowley has said of him, who has been once touched with a fondness for the Muse; âWhere once such sairies dance, no grass doth ever grow.â Years however followed, in which this passion was suppressed and blighted, by disappointment and untoward accidents: but the ground, alas! lay barren, for it had been rendered unfit to bear any other fruit. The tone of some of the expressions in this Sonnet was, I think, suggested by some passages in one of Milton's. TO A FRIEND. REASONS FOR ATTENDING TO POETRY. Oct. 1, 1782. Askest thou, why I court the slighted lyre? In hopes, thro' life 'twill cheer my steady way, Drawn by no worldly pomp, nor cares astray, And give me passport to the heavenly choir. The conscience, pure delight that I inspire, And for good deeds alone pour forth the lay, No aid, my friend, to lead me calmly gay Thro' ignorance and envy will require. I strike the strings: and strait my purged ear Hears not their praise or blame. For if my song Should, as it breathes, illume the brow of care, The sluggard rouse, or bear the faint along; Shall I for self alone have labour'd here? Oh, no! The plea shall gain my soul heav'n's tuneful throng. SONNET II. To Miss M?, WRITTEN BY MOON-LIGHT. July 18, 1782. Sweet gentle angel, not that I aspire To win thy favour, tho' ambition raise My wishes high, I wake anew my lays; But that thine image may adorn my lyre With beauty, more than fancy could inspire! As, when behind the silver clouds she strays, The moon peeps thro', and sheds a mellow blaze, Till woods, hills, vallies, with enchantment fire; So does thy soul, tho' pent in mortal mould, Break thro' the brighten'd veil; illume thy form; In thy sweet manners all its powers unfold; With soften'd lights each varied feature warm; And in thine eyes such fairy radiance hold, That on each object round they beam a magic charm. SONNET III. After three and twenty years further experience of the world, I feel with still more force, the sentiments, which thus issued from the depth of my heart at so early an age. ON THE CHARMS OF NATURE. July 24, 1782. Ye alleys green, and high o'er arching trees, Where Summer flings his fragrance wild around, And feather'd choirs a native concert sound; Ye melancholy sighings of the breeze; And thou, pale Moon, whose fairy beamings seize My soul with transport ever new, art crown'd With placid joys, more charming than are found Mid golden roofs and lamps, and all the art to please! Can crowded cities, and tumultuous noise, Where Envy, Pride, and deep Resentment wake, Produce such sober, peaceful, genuine joys? Can man's vain toils a mimic grandeur make, With charms like these, whose pleasure never cloys, Whose varying sweets not Time himself can shake? SONNET IV. I suspect that part of the language was suggested by a familiarity with the poems of Collins, who was one of the greatest favourites of my youthful taste. ON DREAMS. Oct. 15, 1782. O gentle Sleep, come, wave thine opiate wing, And with thy dewy fingers close mine eyes! Then shall freed Fancy from her cell arise, And elves, and fairies dance in airy ring Before her sight, and melting visions bring Of virgin love, pure faith, and lonely sighs; While on the passing gale soft music dies, And hands unseen awake the aerial string. Ye dreams, to me than waking bliss more dear; Love-breathing forms, before my view display'd; And fairy songs, that charm my ravish'd ear; Let blackening cares my day with darkness shade, In smiling patience every wrong I'll bear, While ye relume me with your nightly aid! SONNET V. ON ECHO AND SILENCE. Oct. 20, 1782. In eddying course when leaves began to fly, And Autumn in her lap the stores to strew, As mid wild scenes I chanc'd the muse to woo Thro' glens untrod, and woods that frown'd on high, Two sleeping nymphs, with wonder mute I spy:â And lo! she's goneâIn robe of dark-green hue 'Twas Echo from her sister Silence flew: For quick the hunter's horn resounded to the sky. In shade affrighted Silence melts away. Not so her sister. Hark! For onward still With far-heard step she takes her listening way, Bounding from rock to rock, and hill to hill: Ah! mark the merry maid, in mockful play, With thousand mimic tones the laughing forest fill! SONNET VI. Some of the expressions here were suggested by a well-known passage in Shakespeare. TO AUTUMN, NEAR HER DEPARTURE. Oct. 30, 1782. Thou maid of gentle light, thy straw-wove vest, And russet cincture; thy loose pale-ting'd hair; Thy melancholy voice, and languid air, As if shut up within that pensive breast Some ne'er-to-be-divulged grief was prest; Thy looks resign'd, that smiles of patience wear, While Winter's blasts thy scatter'd tresses tear, Thee, Autumn, with divinest charms have blest! Let blooming Spring with gaudy hopes delight, That dazzling Summer shall of her be born; Let Summer blaze; and Winter's stormy train Breathe awful music in the ear of Night; Thee will I court, sweet dying maid forlorn, And from thy glance will catch th' inspired strain. SONNET VII. The exclusive attention and honours that were paid to mathematical pursuits while the author was at Cambridge, and the neglect and contempt with which classical attainments were treated, notwithstanding all that has been said of classical medals, &amp;c. filled him with disgust, and caused this effusion of discontent. In truth the matter could scarcely be otherwise, so long as the tutors and senior residents were principally composed of men, who had acquired distinction, on taking their degrees, solely in the former studies, which was principally the case with those educated in the North, who brought with them to college more skill in those sciences, than a youth from Eton, or Westminster, or Harrow, can hope to obtain during his whole undergraduateship; but who were, for the most part, utterly ignorant even in the rudiments of classical knowledge. A certain proficiency in mathematics is necessary to qualify a person to be a candidate for the classical medal. But more than this: the fact that this medal has almost always been attained by those who have stood at the head of the list for mathematical eminence speaks for itself. The present chief justice of the King's Bench attained both: but his northern origin is well known: and further remarks are too obvious to be necessary. ON RETURNING TO ?, NOV. 5, 1782. O my lov'd lyre, thou cheerer of my days! How ill can I the rude misfortune bear, That, by the damps of this BÅotian air, Thy strings untun'd no more the song will raise! The shout of riot, and th' indecent phrase, The mad fool's bravo to th' assaults of care, Ah! how will these assail my palled ear, Now thou hast ceas'd the magic of thy lays! O thou, the queen of this my tuneless shell, O leave not vacant thus my drooping breast, But touch me, heav'nly muse, with wonted fire! So shall my days within my lonely cell Fleet quick away, in search of wisdom blest, Heedless of Comus, and his noisy choir. SONNET VIII. TO A LADY IN ILLNESS. Feb. 15, 1783. New to the world, when all was fairy ground, And shapes romantic swam before my sight, Thy beauty caught my soul, and tints as bright, And fair as Fancy's dreams, in thee I found: In cold experience when my hopes were drown'd; And life's dark clouds o'er-veil'd in mists of night The forms, that wont to fill me with delight, Thy view again dispell'd the darkness round. Shall I forget thee, when the pallid cheek, The sighing voice, wan look, and plaintive air, No more the roseate hue of health bespeak? Shall I neglect thee as no longer fair? No, lovely maid! If in my heart I seek, Thy beauty deeply is engraven there. SONNET IX. TO EVENING. July 26, 1783. Sweet Eve, of softest voice, and gentlest beam, Say, since the pensive strains thou once didst hear Of him Collins. See his Ode to Evening., the Bard sublime of Arun's stream, Will aught beside delight thy nicer ear? Me wilt thou give to praise thy shadowy gleam; Thy fragrant breath, and dying murmurs dear; The mists, that o'er thee from thy vallies steam, And elfin shapes, that round thy car appear; The music, that attends thy state; the bell Of distant fold; the gently-warbling wind, And watch-dog's hollow voice from cottag'd dell? For these to purest pleasure wake the mind; Lull each tumultuous passion to its cell; And leave soft soothing images behind. SONNET X, These two Sonnets were not inserted in the first edition. All that can be said on the subject of hunting, has been so beautifully given by Somervile, that all attempts to emulate him are hopeless. The coarse joke of Dr. Johnson, that âhe writes very well for a gentleman,â is too contemptible to deserve an answer. Is composition then a trade, a profession, or a manufacture? WRITTEN ON THE APPROACH OF THE COLD WEATHER, OCT. 9. 1783. One morn, what time the sickle 'gan to play, The eastern gates of Heav'n were open laid, When forth the rosy hours did lead a maid, From her sweet eyes who shed a soften'd ray: Blushing and fair she was; and from the braid Of her gold locks she shook forth perfumes gay: Yet languid look'd, and indolently stray'd Awhile, to watch the harvest borne away. But now with sinews brac'd, and aspect hale, With buskin'd legs, and quiver cross her flung, With hounds and horn she seeks the wood and vale, And Echo listens to her forest song: At eve, she flies to hear her poet's tale, And âAutumn'sâ name resounds his shades among. SONNET XI. These two Sonnets were not inserted in the first edition. All that can be said on the subject of hunting, has been so beautifully given by Somervile, that all attempts to emulate him are hopeless. The coarse joke of Dr. Johnson, that âhe writes very well for a gentleman,â is too contemptible to deserve an answer. Is composition then a trade, a profession, or a manufacture? ON HUNTING. Oct. 20, 1783. October, hail to thy melodious morn! Thy gale bears music on its fragrant wings: Hark! to the wind the hound his rapture flings, And the glad huntsman sounds his cheerful horn: The poor hare rues the day that she was born; Tidings of death to her the chorus brings, For the vale echoes, and the forest rings, And fast behind the hunter-band are borne. Onward they come: o'er every barrier fly; Pour down the hill; and skim along the plain; Then up the steep again are tost on high; Nor fear can stop, nor precipice restrain: For courage, vigorous health, and jollity, And manly strength by exercise they gain. SONNET XII. The lady, now of high rank, to whom this Sonnet was addressed, has since, by her amiable conduct in the discharge of the most important duties of life, as much excited the esteem, as she formerly, by her beauty, attracted the admiration of her acquaintance. The structure of the expressions is an obvious parody of a beautiful description in Milton. To Miss Milles Now Lady Sondes. Aug. 4, 1784. Sweet is the gleam of morn; and sweet on high The wandering moon; with sweets all Nature blest: But most the Virgin's beauty strikes the breast; The tender voice, white neck, and full black eye Drowsily-sweet, like Sol thro' clouds; the dye, That paints the cheek, by dark-brown locks carest; The slender form, that grace and ease invest, Yet shrinking from the sight with modesty; The manners form'd to shine in courts; yet meek, And pleas'd with all, and wishing all to please, Enrapture: but when join'd in one they speak, The Bard with joys unutterable seize: Yet such he fear'd but in his dreams to seek, Till Mary blest his gaze with living charms like these. SONNET XIII. The scene of these Sonnets, the place of my nativity, the seat of my fathers, still fills me with the deepest filial affection. My weak words were then, and are still, totally inadequate to a description of its wild and recluse beauties. I left it for Cambridge in October 1780, before I had completed my 18th year, to return to it as my home no more. My dear father died in the following month; and, as a younger brother, it became my lot to part from all the scenes that had been entwined with my earliest pleasures, for ever. Years could not obliterate the prejudice (as it was called) that no other spot on the earth could be the same to me. There were those who told me, âit was a dull place, an ugly place,â and other scornful words, and they wondered at my partiality. But if it was dull and ugly to others, (which yet I defy any one of good taste to say with sincerity that it was) it was not dull and ugly to me! âNescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos Allicit!â O! on what a race of virtues and innocent amusements has the cold grave been closed for ever since that time! I remember that eventful autumn, above all the eventful ones, which are impressed with such vividness, perhaps exceeding the reality, on my harassed fancy! A system of manners, and habits of life, which I have not seen since, were then broken up for ever! Would that I could once more behold them restored! That simplicity, rural contentment, and unostentatious hospitality could be again revived! But in the certain changes of this ever-restless globe, in the inevitable deterioration of modes and customs, as a nation proceeds from wealth to luxury, and from luxury to decline, philosophy warns me that my wish is impossible. The seat here alluded to, stands on an high hill, embosomed in noble trees, about midway on the road between Canterbury and Dover. It forms a conspicuous object immediately on ascending to Barham Downs from Bridge, and continues to exhibit a picturesque but varying feature across a deep valley on the right, nearly till within five miles of Dover. In the reign of queen Elisabeth it was the seat of the learned family of Digges, whose son sir Dudley, a patriot of some celebrity, is known among those who first made a stand in parliament against the encroachments on the liberties of the people attempted by Charles I. The house is of various dates; part modern, and part very ancient. The last Sonnet of these three, was written ten years after the others. WRITTEN AT WOOTTON, IN KENT. Aug. 14, 1784. O ye, the scenes, that nurs'd my childhood sweet, Tho' many a mark to Time's rude sickle bow, Which once I rear'd; and tho' the fervid vow No more to yon fall'n bench shall draw my feet; Nor the green hedge, beneath whose dark retreat For boyish frolics oft I twin'd the bough, Remain: Yet in each tree, whose shadowy brow Spreads o'er the lawn, an ancient friend I greet! Fancy has trick'd thy hill, and wood, and vale With fairy shapes; and from each shrub, and flower; Each sound, the woodman's stroke, the thresher's flail, And of the kennel'd hounds the loud uproar, My tearful smiles past friends, or pleasures, hail, Which all my infant ecstasies restore. SONNET XIV. From LUCRETIUS, B. iv. V 577. CONCERNING ECHOES. Sept. 5, 1784. Wand'ring amid deep woods, and mountains dark, Wilder'd by night, my comrades lost to guide, Oft thro' the void I've rais'd my voice; and hark! The rocks with twenty mimic tones replied. Within those sacred haunts, 'tis said, abide Fauns, Nymphs, and Satyrs, who delight to mark, And mock each lonely sound: but ere the lark Wakes her shrill note, to secret cells they glide. Night-wandering noises, revelry, and joke Disturb the air, 'tis said by rustics round, Who start to hear its solemn silence broke, And warbling strings, and plaintive pipes to sound: And oft they hear, when Pan his reed hath woke, Hills, vales, and woods, and glens the harmony rebound.

Ye scenes, my melancholy soul that fill, Where Nature's voice no crowds tumultuous drown, And, but thro' breaks of trees, the lawn that crown, The paths of men are seen; and farther still, Scarce peeps the city-spire o'er many an hill! Your green retreats, lone walks, and shadows brown, While sheep feed round beneath the branches' frown, Shall calm my mind, and holy thoughts instil. What tho' with passion oft my trembling frame Each real, and each fancied wrong inflame, Wand'ring alone I here my thoughts reclaim: Resentment sinks, Disgust within me dies; And Charity, and meek Forgiveness rise, And melt my soul, and overflow mine eyes. SONNET XVI. UPON AN INVITATION FROM A LADY TO WALK ON THE SEA SHORE. 1785. Nymphs of the Sea, who by the Moon at night, Are wont, when scarcely breathes the whisp'ring gale, To dance upon its level surface, hail! To-morrow with your sports I feast my sight; Play in your freshest breezes, and requite Your music with my song, which shall not fail Along your murm'ring waters to prevail, And make your cliffs re-echo with delight. For she, a nymph divine, to whom ye gave To know your inmost myst'ries, and to view, While the broad lightning plays upon the wave, Your choir their most tremendous rites pursue, E'en she will lead me to each hollow cave, And ope each magic of your azure crew. SONNET XVII. Perhaps it may be unwise to remind the reader of Milton's 7th Sonnet, beginning âHow soon hath Time, &amp;c. WRITTEN NOV. 30, 1784. This thy last day, dark month! to me is dear, For this first saw my infant eyes unbound. Now two-and-twenty years have hasten'd round, Yet from the bud no ripen'd fruits appear: My spirits, drooping at the thought, to cheer, By my fond friends the jovial bowl is crown'd, While sad I sit, my eyes upon the ground, And scarce refrain to drop the silent tear. Yet, O beloved Muse! if in me glow Ambition for false fame, the thirst abate! Teach me, for fields and flocks, mankind to know, And ope my eyes to all that's truly great; To view the world unmask'd, on me bestow; And knaves and fools to scorn, undazzled by their state!

While I re-wander o'er this wood-crown'd steep, Yon sheep-clad lawn, and this secluded dell, Yon Mansion, and yon holy Tower, that peep From the thick trees, where in their silent cell The hallow'd relics of my fathers sleep, I strive in vain the tumults to repel That force mine eyes with sad regret to weep, Since my sweet childhood's lost delights they tell. Here my lov'd Parent pass'd his happy days In rural peace, with every Virtue warm'd, While the wide country round, that rung his praise, His sense directed, and his goodness charm'd: But I, alas, to genuine pleasures blind, Tost on the world's wide waves, no quiet find! SONNET XIX. ON MOOR-PARK, NEAR FARNHAM, SURRY, FORMERLY THE SEAT OF SIR WM. TEMPLE, WHOSE HEART WAS BURIED IN THE GARDEN THERE. To yonder narrow vale, whose high-slop'd sides Are hung with airy Oaks, and umbrage deep, Where thro' thick shades the lulling waters creep, And no vile noise the musing mind derides, But Silence with calm Solitude abides, Temple with joy retir'd, that he might keep A course of quiet days, and nightly sleep Beneath the covering wings of heavenly guides, Virtue and Peace.âHere he in sweet repose Sigh'd his last breath.âHere Swift in youth, reclin'd, Pass'd his smooth days! O had he longer chose Retreats so pure, perchance his nicer mind, (That the World's wildering follies, and its woes To madness shook,) had ne'er with sorrows pin'd! SONNET XX. âDid you never,â says Gray, in one of his letters, âobserve, (while rocking winds are piping loud) that pause, as the gust is recollecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a thrill and plaintive note, like the swell of an Ãolian harp? I do assure you, there is nothing in the world so like the voice of a spirit. Thomson had an ear sometimes; he was not deaf to this; and has described it gloriously, but given it another different turn, and of more horror. I cannot repeat the lines; it is in his Winter.ââGray's Works, by Mason, 281. THE WINDS. Aug. 23, 1784. Sublime the pleasure, meditating song, Lull'd by the piping of the winds to lie, While ever and anon collecting, fly The choir still swelling as they haste along, And shake with full Ãolian notes the sky: A pause ensues; the Sprites, that lead the throng, Recall their force, and first begin to sigh, Then howls the gathering stream the rocking domes among. Methinks I hear the shrieking Spirits oft Groan in the blast, and flying tempests lead, While some aÃ«rial beings sighing soft Round once-lov'd Maids their guardian wishes plead: Spirits of Torment shrilly speak aloft, And warn the wretch, who rolls in guilt, to heed! SONNET XXI. See Milton's 20th Sonnet to Mr. Lawrence. TO THE REV. COOPER WILLYAMS, A. M. Now rector of Kingston, and Stourmouth in Kent. Friend of my early childhood, since the wane Of the declining year no more invites To bask abroad in air, while falling rain, And the cold blast, the wand'ring footstep frights From miry pathways, and from field-delights; In this old Mansion, where the pictur'd pane With pomp of ages past enchants our sights, Here let the blazing hearth our hours detain! Round the glad board while wine, inspiring wine, Liberal not lavish, aids the unbending mind, Let my wild gloomy fancy, joy divine In the mix'd sunshine of thy humour find! For worldly storms, and every eddying blast But bid us to old friendships cling more fast. SONNET XXII. AN EVENING IN MAY. Ye glittering Stars of Heav'n's blue concave, Hail! Ye ancient Oaks, that lift your branches high In the dim twilight of the azure sky, Beneath whose arms I hear the Nightingale Pour out her liquid notes across the Vale; While mates from every half-leaf'd covert nigh In exquisitely varied notes reply! Thou faded hill, where bleating Lambs bewail Their mothers lost! thou hedge, yet dimly seen, That skirt'st the Meadow, whence the schreel-owl cries! Ye glancing lights, that oft by fits, between The opening branches, from the village rise! Hail, soul-composing scenes, and harmonies, That raise the soul to heavenly ecstasies! SONNET XXIII. OCTOBER. Oct. 18, 1784. O lov'd October! still my vacant day As thou return'st, in rural sweets shall fly! Mid yellow fields; mid woods of tawny dye, Whose fragrant leaves about my pathway play; By russet hedges; all thy morns I'll stray: And round the cheerful fire in converse high With choicest spirits meet, when o'er the sky Soft social Evening draws her mantle grey. Nor will we cease, till Midnight's reign profound, The sweet communion of the fleeting hour, While blasts that yet but weakly whistle round, Urge to enjoy the moment in our power, Warning of winter-days in tumult drown'd, Far from the quiet of the rural bower. SONNET XXIV. No more by cold Philosophy confin'd; By fearful models now no more deprest; I give full range to my erratic mind, And with wild visions soothe my beating breast! Hail, thou lov'd season, when the hollow wind Strips the torn forest of its golden vest; Shrieks in the echoing domes, and frights the hind, Who sees sad spirits thro' his broken rest! But while the rain descends, and while the storm Bursts in loud eddies thro' the sobbing grove, Spirits before my view of heavenly form, And scenes of wondrous beauty seem to rove! Sweet Inspiration's voice my Fancy hears; And verse immortal seems to meet my ears! SONNET XXV. Ah me! wish! the vision cannot last; And sad reality must undeceive! The painted shapes of Fiction's loom are past; And Truth's dull hues with keener sadness grieve. Yet shall the Muse a grace, tho' mournful, cast O'er the deep sighs she taught the breast to heave; Shall turn to music every wailing blast; And light with fairy rays the darksome eve. Weary of Hope; by cold Neglect subdued, No more tho' Fancy imp her eagle plumes, Yet shall she soothe the melancholy mood, And throw a smile on Disappointment's glooms! Soft are the woes, with which the lyric string, Unheard by mortals, makes the forest ring. SONNET XXVI. All these were written for the novel of Mary De Clifford, which was begun in the end of October 1791; and, being sent to the press in sheets as it was written, was published in January 1792. After a lapse of nearly sixteen years, the warmth of some of its descriptions seems to require this notice of its date. All the Sonnets, except the first and last of them, are written in the character of Woodvile, the hero of the piece. The description of Grafton is of a fictitious place; though such was the name of the residence of the real family of Woodvile. TO THE MOON. FROM THE STORY OF MARY DE-CLIFFORD. O thou fair Moon, that o'er these fairy hills Castest thy silver radiance, while the dew On every blade her pearly drops distils, And all delighted feed the fleecy crew! Sure heavenly spirits often love to hail Thy rising rays, and haunt thy shadowy light, And, frequent as thou stoop'st beneath the veil Of yonder clouds, repeat the mystic rite! At such an hour as this, methinks I hear Aerial voices whisper to mine ear, And thrill with inexpressive joy my frame! With thee, Sweet Beam, oh! ever mayst thou bring Such lovely peace, such joy without a sting, And lift my soul to so divine a flame! SONNET XXVII. All these were written for the novel of Mary De Clifford, which was begun in the end of October 1791; and, being sent to the press in sheets as it was written, was published in January 1792.

The description of Grafton is of a fictitious place; though such was the name of the residence of the real family of Woodvile. ON A STORM. FROM THE SAME. Loud blows the wind; the whistling woods among Whirl the fall'n leaves, and in the troubled sky Quick and portentous drive the clouds along, While o'er the grass the hurried breezes sigh: Anon, the fearful moment past, the sun Breaks through the darkness; and the brightened streams, Roaring no more, in silent splendor run, While the white steeple glitters in his beams! Again the gloom collects, a louder groan Shakes all the groves, and down descends the rain; And storms and sunshine mark by fits the day. Thus me by turns, oft pensive and alone, The passions rule! O who shall soothe the pain Beneath whose threats my youthful hopes decay? SONNET XXVIII. All these were written for the novel of Mary De Clifford, which was begun in the end of October 1791; and, being sent to the press in sheets as it was written, was published in January 1792.

The description of Grafton is of a fictitious place; though such was the name of the residence of the real family of Woodvile. THE WANDERER. FROM THE SAME. Cross these lone downs th' unhappy wanderer strays, Views the seas spread, and hears the billows roar; While no kind friend his moody footsteps stays, Or seeks his bosom's quiet to restore. Perchance, O Stranger, should'st thou find these lays, Shed tears of pity as thou read'st them o'er: For dark and gloomy pass his tedious days, While years of lost delight his thoughts deplore. She, heavenly angelâ(ah! in vain the thought These mystic lines will ever meet her eyesâ) Sees the wing'd moments speed with rapture fraught, And lost in flattery, dreams not of his sighs; Yet she perchance will drop a precious tear, When calm at length he rests upon his bier.

FROM THE SAME. Ye mould'ring towers, these waters deep surround, That, age succeeding age, the forest-shades Of yon romantic wilds have proudly crown'd! The voice of Revelry no more invades Your dreary courts; nor yet with tuneful sound Do royal Edwards Alluding to Edward the Fourth's courtship of Elizabeth Woodville, at that place. woo th' Aonian maids To melt the Fair, who on their suit have frown'd: But, shook by Time and Fate, your glory fades. No more shall Beauty with her winning eyes Brighten your halls, and o'er your feasts preside; But sad and lonely, while your master flies O'er foreign lands his sorrows to divide; Silence shall reign along your chearless walls, Save when disturb'd by nightly spirits' calls. SONNET XXX.

The description of Grafton is of a fictitious place; though such was the name of the residence of the real family of Woodvile. ON MUTUAL LOVE. FROM THE SAME. Oh Love, requited Love, how fine thy thrills, That shake the trembling frame with ecstasy; E'en every vein celestial pleasure fills, And inexpressive bliss is in each sigh; In the tranc'd ear aerial music trills, Fairies enchanted radiance round supply, Nectar divine the magic cup distils, And heavenly figures dance before the eye: The dear adored Beauty, who in tears Seen thro' her smiles, has charm'd the Lover's woes, An Angel not of earthly mould appears, And spreads enchantment wheresoe'er she goes. Oh Heav'n, kind Heav'n, that joy like this would last! But Bliss is not for earth; clouds rise, the vision's past. SONNET XXXI.

Beam not on meâthose heavenly looks, sweet maid, Beam not on me, lest lost in bliss I die!â Still as that angel-figure I survey'd Down the glad dance in graceful motion fly; Those flowing ringlets on thy neck display'd; That lovely bosom heave the trembling sigh; Those twinkling feet, that 'neath thy garments play'd, Celestial beauty met my raptur'd eye. But oh! those tender glances pierce my soul With melting pleasures too intense to bear; In vain I would my bursting tears controul, And calm the tremblings that my bosom tear. âOh, sweetest Mary, spare the liquid fire, Those hallow'd glances dart, or I expire! SONNET XXXII. All these were written for the novel of Mary De Clifford, which was begun in the end of October 1791; and, being sent to the press in sheets as it was written, was published in January 1792.

When this sad spirit quits its woe-worn frame, And flies releas'd to yonder starry sphere, O ne'er may it forget its former flame, But still the friends it lov'd on earth be dear! Then thou, thou idol of my heart, whose name My trembling lips pronounce but with a tear, Wilt first and most its guardian wishes claim, And thee its ceaseless care will hover near! O thou, who only can'st my bosom warm, Think not a selfish passion fills my heart; For if some happier maid of fairer form More joy can to thy social hours impart, O let me but go hence, and watch above Thy earthly bliss with pure seraphic love! SONNET XXXIII. The novel, in which these were inserted, it is not necessary to name.

FROM A NOVEL, 1798. Along the lone wood shrieks the hollow blast; And quick the doubling mists obscure the day: Where the voice echoes, or the windows cast Their distant glancing lights, I seek my way: Before me, thick and sheety vapours spread, Seem, like a lake, to level all the vale; While drives the drizzling fog, and o'er my head The bending clouds in pillowy darkness sail. These are the scenes, in which, howe'er I rove In doubtful paths, my fancy loves to rise! Ideal buildings people every grove, And fairy forests bound th' approaching skies! Clad in the grey obscurity, I view More beauteous scenes than Nature ever knew! SONNET XXXIV. The novel, in which these were inserted, it is not necessary to name.

FROM A NOVEL, 1798. Behold thy triumphs, Time! what silence reigns Along these lofty and majestic walls; Ah! where are regal Sidney's pompous trains Sir Henry Sidney, Lord President of the Marches, who kept his court at Ludlow Castle.? Where Philip's tuneful lyre, whose dying falls Could melt the yielding nymphs, and love-sick swains Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia.? Ah! where th' undaunted figure, that appals E'en heroes? Where the lute, that on the plains The bending trees Alluding to Waller's lines, written at Penshurst, round Sacharissa calls? And are they fled? Their day's for ever past! Heroes and poets moulder in the earth! No sound is heard, but of the wailing blast, Through the lone rooms, where echoed crowded Mirth! Yet on their 'semblance Melancholy pores, And all the faded splendour soon restores. SONNET XXXV. The novel, in which these were inserted, it is not necessary to name.

FROM A NOVEL, 1798. O what is wealth, in pride of heart, he said, Compar'd with you, ye treasures of the mind? O what the tinsel toys, in which array'd, The rich man strives the eye of Sense to blind? In these refreshing lawns, this haunted shade, How oft has Fancy splendid forms design'd; Whose gleams before th' enraptur'd sight display'd, Would leave the glare of Eastern Kings behind! Can Wealth, the head to form, the heart to feel, The soul, that lifts the man to Heaven, bestow? The power, from Grief, Scorn, Malice, to appeal, And lose, in dreams of bliss, Revenge's blow?â No fears then, Poverty, can'st thou inspire, Give but the vigorous head, the soul entire!

Where o'er the sea Night's blackest shadows form, And on the sounding shore the surges crowd, The flash, that issues from the parting cloud, Gleams but to shew the horrors of the storm: Deeper the shades condense: the troubled wave With louder thunder rolls; then, as again Breaks a new flash across the fearful main, With gather'd force the tempest seems to rave. 'Tis thus to me the momentary ray Of tender Hope, that springs within my breast, Appears in gloomier colours to betray The group of dÃ¦mons that my path infest! âO rather wrap this heart, consum'd with care, E'en in th' impervious shades of dark despair!

FROM A NOVEL, 1798. Break, foolish heart: nor let thy woes be known! Ye tears, that down my pallid cheeks distream, Be sacred, nor betray my secret moan! Idol, to whom my lips in every dream Will mutter uncontroul'd their fervid vows, O cruel, come not thou my slumbers near, Lest at such sacred hours, as these, thou hear, What love on thee my babbling tongue bestows! No: let the torrents of my swollen eyes Be lost unnotic'd in this lonely flood! Away, ye murmurs, and ye bursting sighs, Mix with the blasts of this untrodden wood! Thus Peace shall gradual come to my relief; And Death record the patience of my grief. SONNET XXXVIII. The novel, in which these were inserted, it is not necessary to name. Much clamour was raised against it, on pretence of personalities, some of which had no other ground than the malignant fancies of those who applied them. The XXXIVth SONNET was written after a visit to Penshurst, in Kent, formerly the magnificent seat of the Sydneys, and still owned and inhabited by their descendant by the female line, who has taken the name. WRITTEN IN THE CHURCH YARD OF ORLETON. FROM A NOVEL, 1798. Ye, who beneath these mouldering heaps have found Rest from the sorrows of humanity! I come to keep my vigils on the ground, Where I, too, soon at peace with you shall be! Then when this throbbing heart has ceas'd to beat, And lifeless lies this weak and trembling frame, Malice itself perchance may not repeat The cruel sounds that now assail my name. With flowing tears upon the turf I bend, Beneath whose shade my ashes will decay; And thus, I cry, Fresh flowers, your perfumes lend To the lone gales, that o'er my grave will play! And thus, ye breezes, in the solemn tone Of calm and heav'n-rapt melancholy, moan! SONNET XXXIX. From a subsequent novel, which has not engaged equal notice, because it was so cautiously written, that the very personalities, for which the former was so cruelly blamed, could not be attributed to it. FROM A NOVEL, 1802. O'er this blue wat'ry world, that spreads around Far, far beyond the utmost stretch of sight, How sweet the rippling surges' soothing sound; Th' extended canopy of Heaven how bright! Smooth as we go, while scarce the keel divides The glassy surface, o'er my thrilling breast How blissful the serenity that glides! How, like the blast, the passions sink to rest! But will this brilliant scene, my Eustace, last? Will no winds gather, and no clouds arise, This wide-invested splendor to o'ercast? Dark in the rear perchance the tempest lies: But roar the bellowing storm, and rage the sea! Still that alone I dread, which separates me from thee! SONNET XL. From a subsequent novel, which has not engaged equal notice, because it was so cautiously written, that the very personalities, for which the former was so cruelly blamed, could not be attributed to it. FROM A NOVEL, 1802. Ye genial beams of this reviving Sun, Thro' whose soft influence, o'er the spreading meads Wand'ring I see the vivid verdure run! Primrose and violet, whose fragrance leads The early honours of the coming Spring! Sweet birds, whose voice in the yet leafless grove I hear with doubtful tremulous prelude sing! New hopes within my breast begin to move! And thou too, whose lov'd image in my mind Holds the first place; but in my stormy brain Late with the rest was wreck'd, thy form I find With softness still more melting rise again! Bliss here on earth e'en yet may be my lot; And in thine arms my griefs be all forgot! SONNET XLI. From a subsequent novel, which has not engaged equal notice, because it was so cautiously written, that the very personalities, for which the former was so cruelly blamed, could not be attributed to it. FROM A NOVEL, 1802. Dark o'er the sky has Night her shadows spread! The lulling murmur of the hollow wind A drowsy music utters; while the hind Lies in sweet slumber on his lowly shed. Me, whom to no fatiguing labours bred, The Morning saw, to gentler deeds assign'd, Chase the sweet phantoms of an active mind, New shapes still beckon from my restless bed! Perchance, while yet a thousand beauteous forms Dance with enchanted radiance on my eye, My trembling bosom keener pleasure warms; But think, O hind, of Sorrow's sharper sigh! Mine the mad pang, as mine the rapt delight: Thine the calm day, and undisturbed night! SONNET XLII. These have been published in the 4th volume of the Poetical Register. They were written at the close of 1805. Black from the sky November fogs impend; And drizzling mists enshroud the hill and vale; While o'er the darken'd downs my course I bend, And, pleas'd, below, the shelter'd valley hail. With dangers compass'd round, beset with foes, As on the daring steed I seek my way, Methinks the scowling tempest suits my woes, And soothes the cares, that on my bosom prey! O lovely Muse, 'tis thine with heavenly power To throw a charm on Sorrow's gloomiest hues; And, thro' the deepening clouds that round us lour, A piercing ray of golden light diffuse! Ah; generous maid, amid the sable storm, Circled with brightest beams still shines thy fairy form! SONNET XLIII. These have been published in the 4th volume of the Poetical Register. They were written at the close of 1805. Thou must not be another's, O my home! Here, where my infant children's voices shrill Thy spacious halls with constant echoes fill, From the rude stranger sacred be the dome! And should some upstart, with rash heart presume To fix beneath thy shelter his abode, May nightly ghosts his guilty conscience goad, And fiends by day around his pathway roam! When all this numerous race, that sport around, Shall, with their parents, low in earth be laid, Still may their children's children here be found To own this pile, and save yon growing shade! âHere,â may they say, âour grandsires dwelt of yore; âAnd here they nurs'd the Muse's sacred lore!â SONNET XLIV. These have been published in the 4th volume of the Poetical Register. They were written at the close of 1805. With life's unceasing tempests struggling still, Onward I go; no interval of rest To calm the troubles of my beating breast! But thus it is, perchance, that I fulfil Th' allotted part, that is my Maker's will; And thus hereafter, when his high behest Shall call on trembling mortals to attest Their labours here, some mercy for the ill That I have done on earth I may obtain! Neglected, scorn'd, traduc'd, with threats pursued Which boldest minds have awed; yet all in vain: The Muse's rites no sufferings have subdued. From paths, her votaries haunt, I cannot swerve; Careless of gaining praise, if I deserve! ODES. ODE I. To Miss Kenrick, on her departure. Jan. 25, 1782. For many an hour of soft delight, Rais'd in my soul by thy fond sight; For many a sail on Pleasure's stream, Still soften'd in my nightly dream, Thy memory shall live enshrin'd Within the temple of my mind; And if we meet in worlds above, My soul to thee still grateful prove. Can I forget how I have hung Enamour'd on thy gentle tongue? How, as (like Morning's orient streaks) Youth 'gan to open on thy cheeks, I've mark'd the melting languor spread, That thy sweet eyes around have shed; Have mark'd the dear unpractis'd sigh, Within thy heaving bosom lie? With what emotion I have seen Thy artless smile, thy tender mien? Can I forget the raptur'd pains These charms have caus'd within my veins? No: for these joys bestow'd on me, May Heaven its blessings shed on thee! Heav'n knows, when we shall meet again: And dare I hope this simple strain Will in Futurity's lone hour, Recall me from Oblivion's power, And, as I e'er shall think on thee, A moment turn thy thoughts on me. Farewell: May Woe, with entrance rude, Ne'er on thy gentle breast intrude, But all thy tender minutes roll In love, and harmony of soul! The subject of this poem died not long afterwards in the flower of her youth. ODE II. My memory may fail me at the distance of twenty-four years; but I suspect, from having lately seen again sir William Blackstone's Ode on a similar subject, which is revived in Mr. Southey's Specimens, that mine was suggested by it. I had then just completed my twentieth year; and had left Cambridge for chambers in the Middle Temple. With a head, at that time, full of poetry and romance, I was then the most unfit being upon earth for such a study. No utterly unknown language appeared to me more unintelligible. In a state of mind calculated to throw the mantle of imagination over every thing, I was called upon to analyse and discriminate subjects, coarse, hard, dry, and repulsive at any distance, but absolutely disgusting in proportion as they were nearly and minutely examined. I had been destined to the bar from boyhood, because my maternal ancestor had formerly attained the summit of his profession, and elevated his family to the highest rank and honours; but, ignorant as I was, I had not expected an arena of sophistry, instead of eloquence; a forum for the quibbles of special pleading, instead of the display of talents enlarged by the cultivation of general literature, and exercised in the powers of glowing and energetic language. I was not prepared to be nosed by attornies clerks, who though stupid by nature, and quite illiterate from want of education, but conversant with copying the files of office, would have silenced all the rich and profound effusions of Burke himself! I soon shrunk therefore into a state of mortified idleness and despondence; I never therefore mixed with these coarse spirits; and passed every day and hour away from them, when residence could be dispensed with. Even now my heart sinks, whenever I enter those abodes of gloom, and sophistry, and hardness of mind. Not but I have among them, the most intimate friend of my youth, a man of most powerful faculties, and as powerful acquirements; but he felt the necessity of exerting himself, and he now experiences the happy effects of it. UPON BEGINNING THE STUDY OF THE LAW. 1783. Yes, Glory! I have heard the sound, That shook the vale and hills around, Where all at ease reclin'd I lay, With melting Poesy at play. Rous'd at thy call to sterner Law, To him my ling'ring steps I draw. Yet must I leave my native plain, No more to see my love again? What, though no more I all day long May listen to her am'rous song; Tho' I no more, from morn to eve, Her fairy legends may believe; A backward glance I still may roll, To soothe the feelings of my soul; And still at times thy toils may cease, And thou thy captive may'st release, Again in fairy paths to meet The nymph, that led his infant feet; To trace the verdure, as it spreads Its stealing progress o'er the meads; To mark the leaves begin to bud, And hear the birds awake the wood; And busy rooks, with clamour loud, That round the reverend elm-trees crowd; To mark the Spring's soft genial cheer From trance awaken'd Nature rear, And all the face of things rejoice Rous'd by her enlivening voice: With her, in Summer's noontide heat, In some deep shade to take his seat, And there unfold with rapt regard The tale of some enchanted Bard. Inspired Spencer then perchance Across the lone retreat may glance, Reproach my poor affrighted maid, And tell her how she him betray'd; How she on him from childhood smil'd, And thence to dwell with her beguil'd; How she his heavenly song resin'd Too exquisite for gross mankind! For he to winds, and waters sung, And Want assail'd his god-like tongue. Scar'd at the warning aim'd at me, I then once more shall yield to thee. But, Glory, thou wilt still allow To her to breathe my casual vow: With her sometimes, at midnight hour, Amid the elemental roar, When Winter bids his winds arise, And spirits howl along the skies, To turn the page of heroes old, Of fairy Knights, and Barons bold, And many a soft bewitching maid, In fell enchanter's castle laid: Then creep with thrilling fear to bed, Nor turn around the room my head, Lest 'mid the solemn shades of night, Their ghosts should meet my shuddering sight. If such indulgence thou wilt give, Then I with toilsome Law will live. The author's resolutions were vain: he found that he could âliveâ but a very little while âwith toilsome Law.ââ 1806. ODE III. To Miss L. Lâ, of Iâd. WRITTEN BY MOONLIGHT, JUNE 6, 1783. By silver Cynthia's shadowy gleam We drink of Inspiration's stream; A thousand fairy shapes we see That with the pensive mood agree; Forms in a thousand lights combin'd Fleet before the tranced mind; And lest we lose the airy train, We paint them in the living strain. Soft maid, lest like the passing cloud, The scenes that on my fancy crowd, When, by mild Cynthia's pensive ray, To feast my thoughts on thee I stray, Lest these so swift should pass, my lyre Shall tell each thought thy charms inspire! As in the pilgrimage of life, Beset with many a toil and strife, The steepy hill of Fame doth rise In hard ascent before my eyes, (Yet such as ne'er shall me detain To haunt alone the lowly plain) Awhile my spirits droop; but soon Thy form appears in beauty's noon: âBe thou companion of my way,â I cry, âand all my paths are gay; âFor well I know thy soothing smile âThe mighty labour can beguile.â Thus as I speak, and watch the shade, My idolizing soul has made, Again, sweet nymph, in fancy's ear, Thy mild and simple voice I hear; Again I view, as thou dost speak, The blush, that paints thy tender cheek, And these can more than toil requite; O'er darker demons shed their light: In vain the fiends that haunt my way, When thou art by, will watch their prey; Vain will be envy, strife, and scorn, As spectres in the ray of morn: Vainly, if thou wilt smile, dear maid, Shall hills oppose, and foes invade! Yet when my fancy sees thy form With beauty, truth, and softness warm, How can I hope thy wondrous charms Will yield to bless my ruder arms? But, âdear possessor of my breast,â Sweet soother of my cares to rest, Ah! think a frown upon my joy Would all my fairy piles destroy! ODE IV. TO SPRING. April 14, 1784. Hence, Winter, gloomy Pow'r! Beneath thine iron rod we groan too long; Nor vernal sight, nor song, Hath yet awoke to soothe the lagging hour. Go, with thy loathed band, Where hills of ice and snowy mountains rise, Whose strength the sun defies: There, amid dismal caves and icy thrones, Dispense thine horrid frowns; While storms, and hail, and wind for ever fill the land, But come, soft Spring! no more delay To bless us with thy genial sway! Thy beams have yet but faintly shone, By storms and darkness soon o'erblown; No fost'ring warmth they yet have shed To wake the verdure of the mead; To ope the primrose' wild perfume, Or rear to life the vi'let's bloom. Then come, sweet nymph, with fixed pace! The tyrant shall with fearful face Behold far off thy steady beams, And haste away his ragged teams. O come, thou Queen of gay delights, Tho' late, to bless our longing sights! Flow'rs shall spring up beneath thy way, And earth, and air, and seas be gay. Adown the mountain's woody side The tumbling torrent shall subside; And the whistling wind no more Thro' the castle's turrets roar; But rills shall lulling music keep, And spires, and battlements shall peep With glittering hue, amid the shade; While shepherds' pipes shall from the glade Echo sweet; and virgins gay, With fresh-bloom'd cheeks, to hear them play, Shall issue from the castle's bounds, And dance to thee their merry rounds. On shadowy greens to thee the Fays Shall there a moon-light altar raise; And there, by Cynthia's paly ray, Will I to thee my orgies pay!â Meads shall smile; the frisking flock Shall bleat from valley, and from rock; And oft at fold their tinkling bell Shall wake the Poet's pensive shell; To thee by twilight he shall sing, Sooth'd by the air soft-murmuring. At morn, from furrow'd lands afar, Plowmen's songs shall tend thy car; And the woodman's echoing stroke, That too often hath awoke The genius of the deepen'd wood From the still shades of his abode. But, within the fertile vale, Daisied pastures shall not fail, With flow'rets wild of ev'ry hue, To ope their blossoms to thy view; While the steeple-bells shall ring, And down the wave their echoes fling, Which, soften'd by the warbling wind, With ecstasies shall fill the mind. In yonder pansied meadow's bound, With hills, and wood, enclos'd around, My love and I will wildly stray, To pick each flower, that drinks thy ray. May her enchanting form no fate, Like that unhappy maid's, await, Whom gloomy Dis by force convey'd To his low region's dismal shade! For she, sad nymph, had only stray'd To bask amid thy fragrant blooms, And fill her lap with thy perfumes, When he, black God! with grim delight, Bore the wild maid to endless night. Ah, no! I never will profane With gloomy fears thy joyous reign; But, while this youthful blood shall sport Within my veins, I thee will court; The pleasures of thy train will join, And hail thy blooming nymphs divine; To them my tales of love repeat, And mark, how thy prolific heat On their soft cheeks bids blushes rise, And sheds sweet languor o'er their eyes. If hoary locks my temples shade, Ere in the peaceful grave I'm laid, Then may I haunt the rural hall, Round which the rooks, with clamorous call, To thee their early rites begin, Far from the peopled city's din; And wak'd by them, at dawning day, Watch how the buds their leaves display; And sooth'd by them, when Eve shall come, Mark their thick flocks returning home! Awhile contentious strife, and noise, And loud complaint, their rest destroys; But by degrees the tumults close, The murmurers sink to calm repose. While thus I watch them to their nest, Sooth'd by soft sympathy to rest, Sweet slumbers o'er mine eyes will creep, And in mild dreams my fancy steep. Thus, Spring, with thee I'll pass my day, Thus soothe my evening hours away; Thus, as I totter on life's brink, To my last slumbers softly sink. ODE V. I Since Time at length has lull'd to rest The wild confusions of my breast, And her lov'd image, at whose sight My senses were in tumult tost, Can now appear more gently bright, And sooth my soul to calm delight, My fancy shall in dreams be lost, Of all those fairy pleasures o'er, Which will return no more. II How oft, amid th' Autumnal reign, I met my angel on the plain! How oft we cheerly clos'd around The social board, when evening came! Nor were her sweet attentions drown'd In mirth, and flattery's syren sound; But with kind looks she fed my flame; Nor my sad silence did reprove, But knew it rose from love. III How oft with kind, and patient, ear My faultering accents she did hear, Nor my ineloquence disdain'd! But while vain youths their tales preferr'd, And at her feet with ease complain'd, By my rude converse still detain'd, My incoherent vows she heard; And while their fictions idly flow'd, Her smiles on me bestow'd! IV Once, when she listen'd to my tongue, On her seiz'd hand I fondly hung, With quivering lip, and darting eye, And thoughts as wild as maniacs feel; And bad her mark the lightnings fly, That play'd about the northern sky: When she, as tears adown did steal, Shed on my soul soft Pity's balm, And bad its waves be calm. V But when relentless Time did part From me the charmer of my heart; Then have I sought the lonely glade, On her to feed my pensive mind: There did I still behold the maid, And mutter to her hallow'd shade: Or if the social crew I join'd, Nor jocund bowl, nor festive dance, Could wake me from my trance. VI 'Twas where wild Nature's fertile powers Scatter her most luxuriant showers; Where hills, deep clad with shadowy wood, Compass green meads, and vallies round, My beauteous angel's dwelling stood; And Autumn shed her yellow flood Of light upon th' enchanted ground; Whose russet tints, and dying gleams Still fed my fairy dreams. VII Sithence, whene'er it meets my sight, There seems a visionary light Thrown round each object of the place: In every wind, in every walk, A vanish'd pleasure I retrace, A long-lost mistress I embrace, And with her yet-lov'd shadow talk: And Autumn's gleams my mem'ry still With pensive raptures fill. ODE VI. WRITTEN DURING THE CONFINEMENT OF A LONG INDISPOSITION IN LONDON, 1785. I O! when shall I revisit you, Sweet fields, and waving trees? O! when again, ye forests, view Your shades of every varied hue, That whisper to the breeze? II O when again in alleys green, Beneath umbrageous boughs, Wander in musing mood unseen, Or to my heart's enchanting queen Securely breathe my vows? III O! when again beneath the gloom Of spreading oaks recline, While passing gales that kiss each bloom, And bear its fragrance on their plume Exhale an air divine? IV Here, where new pleasures should appease My agonizing pains, I view no meads; I taste no breeze, But what is loaded with disease; I hear no woodland strains! V Not soft on me thro' chequer'd glades The rays of PhÅbus fall; I find no interposing shades, But heat intense my frame invades, Reflected from the wall. VI Yet if deep shades and brighter skies, Sweet songs and fragrant air, Were all, for which my bosom sighs; The smoke and noise that round me rise, With patience I could bear. VII But, ah! I can endure no more To drag my days apart From Her, whose form my eyes adore, From Her, who can alone restore The raptures of my heart. ODE VII. The scenery of the second and third stanzas of this Ode, is taken from the approach to Dover; and that of the sixth, relates to the castle there. WRITTEN AT EWSHOT IN HAMPSHIRE, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1784. I Nurses of Thought, ye Woody Shades, Ye leaf strown paths of russet glades, Thro' which, at distant openings view'd, Dim heaths of purple cross my sight, Ye will indulge my pensive mood, And let my lovesick fancy brood On those sweet hours of past delight, Which, to the eye of Memory, seem Like an Elysian dream! II 'Twas August: where I past along, Echoed around the harvest song: The sloping hills, that smil'd with green; Glittering with rills, the cottag'd vales, Thro' which, amid a rural scene Of corn and mead, two cliffs between, Peep'd the blue ocean, spread with sails, All, like enchantment, seem'd to rise, Before my ravish'd eyes. III While, as by transient gleams of light, In front the turrets rose to sight, Where she my eager wishes sought, Enjoy'd the fresh'ning ocean's air, A sudden tumult seiz'd my thought; My cheek a sudden paleness caught; And, as the hallow'd spot was near, Beneath me sunk my faultering feet, My trembling bosom beat. IV I entered: but my misty eyes Saw little, and I spoke in sighs: Yet most to her of all around, My voice in vain essay'd to speak; Affrighted at its very sound, Tears rising o'er my sight I found, And burning blushes stain my cheek: But oft a silent glance I stole, That spoke my inmost soul. V When waves scarce murmur'd on the shore, And from afar the lulling oar Dash'd gently on the glittering main, Beneath the noon-tide cliffs we stray'd; Mov'd by the pensive scene, in vain Then did I strive to hide my pain; The streaming tears my heart betray'd; But in her swimming eyes arose A balm for all my woes. VI Again, by evening's shadowy rays, Upon the twilight waves to gaze We rov'd: awhile a glimmering light The cliffs with soft reflection beam'd; At once the thickest shades of night Shed their black veil on every sight; Strange fires across the castle stream'd, Whose walls more deeply frowning stood Upon the sable flood. VII My colour fled, and tremors came O'er my fond soul, and shook my frame; My arm upbore her trembling feet; With love her chilly hand I press'd; Her swimming eyes, that seem'd t' entreat Protection, grew in grief more sweet: I sooth'd with smiles her fluttering breast, While thus to fancy spoke her tears: âWith thee I have no fears.ââ VIII We parted: Sighs my bosom fill'd, Yet on my frame her accents thrill'd, And half beguil'd the tears that flow'd; Night in her sablest mantle frown'd; My horse's feet, that, as he trod, Echoed along the hollow road, Deepen'd the solemn silence round; Yet, in luxurious visions tranc'd, Too quickly I advanc'd. IX Since do I pass the lonely day Far from the social circle gay, Where none may heed my altering pace, My absent looks, my muttering tone; For tho' in every crowded place, By music's sound, and beauty's face, Still should I hear the voice alone, And see alone the image fair, Of her, who was not there. X Ye woods, upon whose solitude I call, to nurse my pensive mood, Witness, that since I left the maid Who fills my heart, and haunts my sight; Alone I've sat beneath your shade, Or 'mid your eddying foliage stray'd, E'en till the melancholy light Of the pale moon's inspiring beams, Lost in my fancy's dreams. ODE VIII. Written at Ewshot, a seat, which for a few months in 1786 was lent the author by a near relation, to whom it still belongs. MARCH. WRITTEN IN 1786. Now the doubling vapours fill The vale, and hover o'er the hill; The heath, that right against the view Lifts it's slope side, is clad in blue; O'er the far-extended wood Deep and still the grey mists brood; While by the hedge, and on the grass, We brush the vapours as we pass. Still is the air; the leaves and herbs Not a single breath disturbs, Save that, by fits, the breeze's sighs In murmurs thro' the boughs arise. Thro' the dead calm that reigns around, Is heard distinctly every sound: The rooks, that still from earliest dawn With caw incessant pass the lawn; Then quick repass, with burden fill'd, Their annual airey to rebuild; The plough, that sometimes screaks;âanon The swain's loud laugh, that guides it on; The clapping gate, at which we see, Slowly returning from the lea, The sower, with his empty sack; The woodman, laden at his back With roots, and broken sticks, and boughs, That custom for his toil allows; Or red-cloak'd housewife of the cot, Who from the vill her stores has got To cheer her household, when they leave The barn, or wood, or field, at eve; Or truant boys, whose cheerful voice Soon in the vale we hear rejoice; The horses' steps along the lane, Or the loud ring of loaded wain; Or from the public road afar The rattle of the fleeter car; (While at each pause from yonder vale We hear the cuckow tell her tale, Or gentle stock-dove pour her moan In deep and melancholy tone); The babbling hounds, whose distant cries Wak'd by the horn's loud melodies, Or shrill-voic'd huntsman's echoing cheer, Die into music in the air; The bleating flock from yonder steep, The dog that bays the straying sheep, And shepherd's hallo from the hill, At which th' obedient dog is still; The village artist's hasty stroke; The slower flail; the falling oak That echoes from the quaking dell; The rapid whirl from cottage well; The cattle, lowing from the farm; And thousands sounds beside, that charm, Now the wings of silence bear Distinct along the listening air. Thus as the airy harp reclin'd Moves to the whispers of the wind, And, in return, from all its strings With more melodious music rings; The curious ear, in ecstasies, Vibrates to Nature's harmonies, And strives the rapture to repay By mimic echoes of her lay. ODE IX. ON AUTUMN. FROM THE STORY OF MARY DE-CLIFFORD, 1792. The heavenly gleams of Autumn shine, And touch the withering groves with gold; To babbling hounds, and straying kine, The yellow fields their gates unfold. Chill morns, and evenings closing soon, The symptoms of the fading year, To me, now changing as the moon, Had been methought for ever dear! But why this boding at my breast, Of future and mysterious grief? These scenes could calm all pains to rest, But now they give me no relief. 'Twas here, e'en here, that I have heard The voice divine of angels speak, And heavenly visitants preferr'd To me their airy thoughts to break! But ah! my moody fancy strays. ODE X. ON MORNING. FROM THE SAME. The morn, in dewy beauty bright, Opes to illume the skirts of night, And deep behind the western wood, No more the half-pierc'd shadows brood: Yet scarce the foot of Labour's seen Trailing his path in deeper green, While herds and flocks, uncall'd to gaze At early wanderer, quiet graze. O scenes of peace, ye calm to rest Th' uneasy tremblings of my breast! Sprites, that, by midnight dark and lone, Haunted my tearful dreams, are flown: Sighing in concert with the blast, Round the tall battlements they past; While I in feverish fancies tost, Seem'd in strange distant countries lost; By friends abandon'd, while the cry Of savage nations bade me die. A heavenly youth arose to save The suff'rer from an early grave: Yet scarce the saviour seem'd to rise, Ere cruel murder clos'd his eyes. Such were the fancies of the night;â Sweet Morn, thou putt'st them all to flight! And, in their stead, a train I find Of soothing visions fill my mind! Hours of my childhood, I renew Fancies of rapture, as I view Yon shelter'd bench; and yonder lawn Calls back a thousand pleasures gone. But ah! that wood, whose tawny leaf, Tho' beauteous, bears the shades of grief, Fills me with pains, I know not why, And every glance renews a sigh. Thou fading year, does Fate ordain I ne'er should view thy spring again? Yet why, foreboding future ill, My soul with vain disquiets fill? Methinks more bliss is in my woe, Than all th' unmingled joys I e'er could know. ODE XI. BY MARY. FROM THE SAME. I How soft the breezes blow! How bright the face of heaven! Yet what avails it to the woe Of never being forgiven? Methinks the yellow lights, that sit Upon the fading grove, The pensive mourner would befit, Who wails her hapless love! Yet naught on earth can cure my care, If I another's days have clouded with despair! II But I,âalas! could I Have caus'd the sufferer's grief, Who, did he for a moment sigh, Could weep for his relief? O thou, whose heavenly tongue so oft I've heard with rapt amaze, Whose thoughts divine, and accents soft, Have charm'd my childish days! I ne'er could think thy warier sight In Mary's simple form could ever find delight! III But ah! my fears are vain.â Yet in the thought I feel A pleasure mingled with the pain, That half my grief would heal. For sure it may not be too late, Since Angels guard him round; And, if with such a power kind Fate This little form has crown'd, Blest were my voice his pangs to calm, And in his bosom's storms these tears to pour their balm! IV Yet whither does he stray? Perchance in woods alone He hears, throughout the mournful day, The bending forest groan: Or on yon cliffs stupendous steep His listless limbs may throw, While loud upon the troubled deep The waters burst below.â Oh Heaven, the gentle youth defend, Lest wild Despair his steps down the dread flood should send! V Perchance in glimmering glades The lonely Moon he wooes, Till, as its silver radiance fades, He, mid descending dews, In dismal darkness wanders on Thro' dreary paths unknown: In vain he prays for cheerful dawn, Unheard he pours his moan; While I, if I have caus'd his pain, Bid not this little voice call back his peace again. VI But yet this childish tongue Th' attention ne'er could raise Of him, whose lyre divine has rung With heavenly angels' praise: Ne'er could this little form with sighs Fill that exalted heart, Nor could these inexpressive eyes A passion there impart.â Of flattery born, begone, ye Fears; For surely Mary's shape is guiltless of his tears! VII Then hail, autumnal gleams, And soothe this heart to peace! Your beauty to the mourner seems From tortures a release. Ye glittering spires, and yellow woods, 'Mid scatter'd hamlets gay; And ye, ye calm and spreading floods, That sparkle with the day, With you, in solitude be mine To nurse my musing soul with Fancy's dreams divine! ODE XII. TO MARY. FROM THE SAME. Where art thou, Mary, pure as fair, And fragrant as the balmy air, That, passing, steals upon its wing The varied perfumes of the Spring? With tender bosom, white as snow; With auburn locks, that freely flow Upon thy marble neck; with cheeks, On which the blush of morning breaks; Eyes, in whose pure and heavenly beams The radiance of enchantment seems; A voice, whose melting tones would still The madness of Revenge from ill; A form of such a graceful mould, We scarce an earthly shape behold; A mind of so divine a fire, As angels only could inspire?â Where art thou, Mary? For the sod Is hallow'd, where thy feet have trod; And every leaf that's touch'd by thee, Is sanctified, sweet maid, to me. Where dost thou lean thy pensive head? Thy tears what tender tale can shed? Where dost thou stretch thy snowy arm, And with thy plaintive accents charm! But hold! that image through my frame Raises a wild tempestuous flame. Oh! Mary, Mary, let the tale Of luckier votaries prevail, And happier, happier days be thine: But woes and phrenzy must be mine. ODE XIII. THE SIX BARDS. FROM A NOTE TO THE POEM, ENTITLED, CROMA, OF OSSIAN, VERSIFIED. 1784. Gray was particularly struck with this poem of Ossian, or rather Macpherson. He says, âIt is full of nature, and noble wild imagination. Five bards pass the night at the castle of a chief (himself a principal bard); each goes out in his turn to observe the face of things, and returns with an extempore picture of the changes he has seen; (it is an October night, the harvest month of the Highlands). This is the whole plan; yet there is a contrivance, and a preparation of ideas, that you would not expect. The oddest thing is, that every one of them sees ghosts (more or less). The idea that struck, and surprised me most is the following. One of them, (describing a storm of wind and rain) says âGhosts ride on the tempest to night: Sweet is their song between the gusts of wind; Their songs are of other worlds!â [Here follows Gray's observation about the pauses between the gusts already cited, p. 219]. He goes on: âThere is another very fine picture in one of them. It describes the breaking of the clouds after a storm, before it is settled into a calm, and when the moon is seen by short intervals. âThe waves are tumbling on the lake, And lash the rocky sides, The boat is brim-full in the cove, The oars on the rocking tide. Sad sits a maid beneath a cliff, And eyes the rolling stream: Her lover promised to come, She saw his boat (when it was evening) on the lake. Are these his groans in the gale? Is this his broken boat on the shore? See the whole in Laing's edition of Ossian, vol. ii. p. 414. Mr. Laing is of opinion it is founded on Macpherson's poem, entitled âThe Night-Piece,â ibid. p. 626. He adds, âThe accumulation of images in the Six Bards could only have been accomplished by a careful assemblage of what other poets have written upon the subject, and by a judicious selection of the most impressive ideas and expressions in each.â ARGUMENT. Five Bards, and a Chief, himself also a Bard, having met in the Chief's hall, one evening in October, the time of the Highland Harvest, each goes severally out to observe the weather, which is then particularly variable, and returning, here gives his Account of it. FIRST BARD. The Night is dull and dark: in clouds Heav'n the high-top'd hill enshrouds: From the black sky no moon doth look: The blast I hear, the wood that shook; Dull and distant now it seems: And murmur low the valley streams. From the yew-tree's solemn shade, The lonely screech-owl wakes the dead. Behold yon misty form arise! 'Tis a ghost! It fades, it flies! From the hut upon the hill The distant dog doth howl; and still The stag lies by the mountain-rill; By his side the faithful hind: Hah! thro' his horns she hears the wind; She starts, but sinks to rest again: The fearful roe doth safe remain In the cleft rock: the heath-cock's head His spreading wing in rest doth shade. Abroad to stray no beast, nor bird, Save the owl and fox, is heard: She upon the leafless tree; On the dark mountain, howling, he. Sad, panting, to despair a prey, The traveller has lost his way; Thro' shrubs and thorns, the forest's maze, Beside the gurgling rills, he strays: The rock, the pool his soul affright; He fears the pale ghost of the night. Trees to the furious blast resound, And falling branches shake the ground: By the wild wind the clinging thorn Along the sighing grass is borne. The Night is cloudy; full of storms; Dark; haunted by the ghostly sprite: Wander the dead in shadowy forms: My friends, receive me from the Night. SECOND BARD. Howling winds the mountain shake; Fast down the hill descend the showers; Windows clap, and forests quake; The growing river roars; The doubtful ford yon traveller tries; But hark, that shriek! He falls, he dies! The cattle fly; the beating rain Drives them from the wat'ry plain; They tremble, as the torrents fall, And seek with eager eyes the stall. The Hunter starts from sleep, dismay'd, And wakes the lone hut's fire decay'd; His dripping dogs smoke round his hearth; He stops the opening chink with earth. Loud roar two mountain-streams; they meet Beside his booth; while sad doth sit The shepherd by the mountain's side; He waits, till the full streams subside; But gathering waters roll around, And groaning trees above him sound; He waits the moon's arising light, To his lov'd home to bear him right. Ghosts ride upon the storm to night: Sweet is their voice the dying winds among, And of other worlds their song. The rain is past, and tempests blow; Windows flap; and rivers flow: Cold drops from the roof descend; The sky is clear; no clouds impend.â But ah! See there the gathering showers; The western sky with darkness lours: The night is stormy; void of light; My friends, receive me from the Night. THIRD BARD. The wind still sounds between the hills; Still the riven rocks it fills; From their high place the firs are bent; Wide the turfy hut is rent: Each way the clouds divided sail, And the burning stars unveil: The meteor, token of our doom, Flies sparkling thro' the lurid gloom; It burns upon the hill: I see The fern, dark rock, and fallen tree. What shrouded ghost, of paly hue, Beneath yon branches do I view? The dark waves tumble on the lake; Upon its rocky sides they break: The oars upon the white wave move; The boat is brimful in the cove: Sad sits a maid the rock beside; She gazes on the rolling tide; She waits her lover's promis'd sight, Whose boat she saw, when yet 'twas light. Are these his shatter'd oars, that break On the rough shore? Is this his shriek, That in the whistling wind does speak? Hark! Descends the rattling hail; Flakes of snow the ground o'erveil: White grows the top of every hill; And the stormy wind is still: Varied, and cold the storm descends: Receive me from the Night, my friends. FOURTH BARD. The Night is calm; and fair: the Heaven Starry and blue: the clouds are driven Far by the winds, that are supprest; And Moonlight on the hills doth rest: Trees glitter: Shine the mountain-streams: Bright rolls the lake its moon-reflecting beams: The scatter'd shocks of corn I see Upon the plain, and fallen tree: The wakeful hind the shocks rebuilds, And whistles on the distant fields. The Night is settled, calm, and fair: But who is flitting in the air, She from the dead, in robe of snow, With golden tresses on her brow, Chief-of-the-people's lovely child, Beneath the spear of Death who smil'd? Come, lovely Maid, and bless our sight, Thou, in whom Heroes took delight! Hah! on the blast the phantom flies: Formless it melts into the skies. Blue mists across the valley fleet: Grey, on the hill the clouds they meet. The Moon throughout the Heav'ns is bright: The Night is starry, calm, and blue: Receive me not, my friends, from Night; The Night is lovely to the view. FIFTH BARD. Calm, but dark the Night; a cloud Doth in the West the Moon enshroud; Cross the dark hill her feeble beam Moves slowly: sounds the distant stream: The torrent murmurs on the rock: From the booth is heard the cock. Past is more than half the night: The housewife wakes the dying light; The kindled fire dispels the gloom; The hunter thinks that morn is come; He calls his nimble dogs around; Whistling he goes, and, at the sound, With him o'er gloomy hills they bound: The cloud, with blasts dispersing, flees: The North's star-circled plough he sees: Much of the night to pass remains: Against the mossy rock he leans. Hark! The wood a whirlwind shakes; A murmur low the valley wakes; The armies vast of dead are there, Returning from the crowded air. The Moon behind the mountain sleeps; Beyond that lofty rock she peeps: The shadows of the trees are tall:â Now massy darkness covers all: Wide the dreadful gloom extends; Receive me from the Night, my friends. SIXTH BARD. THE CHIEF HIMSELF. Let clouds upon the hills appear; Spirits fly, and travellers fear; In the woods let whirlwinds rise; And falling storms disturb the skies; Let windows clap, and torrents roll; Let meteors glare from pole to pole: Let the bright moon her radiance shed, Or in black clouds enclose her head; Little the night employs my care, Stormy, or dark, or blue the air: Night flies before the gleam of morn, Soon as his rays the hill adorn; Dispersing clouds the day restore, But we return from night no more. Where are our mighty kings of old, Our far-fam'd Kings, in battle bold? The fields, where once they fought, are dumb: Scarce remains their mossy tomb! So We from memory shall decay; This lofty house shall sink away; Our sons the fragments of the fall Shall see not; but to age shall call, To tell, where stood their Father's Hall! Raise the song; the harps resound; Send the shells of joy around; Let an hundred tapers shine; Youths and Maids in dances join; The hoary-headed minstrel bring, The deeds of other times to sing: Of mighty Kings, renown'd of old; Of Chiefs, that we no more behold! Thus pass away the cheerful night, Till the first gleams of morning-light; Then, Youths, the twanging bow assume; And, thro' the Night's withdrawing gloom, With tuneful dogs the morning cheer; And climb the hills, and wake the deer! ODE XIV. FROM A NOVEL, 1798. I Thy form revives me, lovely maid! Thine image glances cross the shade, And shews a gleam of joy: Perchance the clouds, that gather round, May not o'erhang the distant ground, Nor distant hopes destroy: Perchance the ray, that breaks From thy enchanting mien, a happier omen speaks. II O days of soft delight, Too little priz'd, when in thy sight, At Orleton's festive dome, I pass'd the dove-wing'd hours, and view'd The beauties, on which now I brood, As through these shades I roam! O days, that come no more; How fondly I regret your pleasures, now they're o'er! III O stay, sweet form; My chilling prospects warm; Nor leave me thus a prey to dreary Woe! O stay, sweet form, and calm My beating breast, and pour a balm Upon these wounds, no other cure can know!â âAlas! the vision flies; And leaves me in despair to breathe my lonely sighs. ODE XV. THE VICTIM OF DESPAIR. FROM A NOVEL, 1802. I Wan moon, behind that cloud Why dost thou hide thy silvery rays? O do not thus thy beams enshroud From the lorn wretch, who for thy guidance prays! While thus I tread the precipice, And hear the roar of torrents rise, Break forth, and lead my steps, my spirits calm, And on my bursting heart shed e'en a transient balm! II To thee the maniac bends; To thee he pours the mournful sigh! But not thy moody light attends One 'mid the frantic tribe so sad as I. O save me from the fiend, Despair, Who in this darkness seems to wear A giant shape of more terrific mien, While by the mists of night his form is dimly seen! III Perch'd on some giddy height Behind me oft the demon sits; The elements combine their spite; Bellows the wave, and howls the blast by fits. Urg'd by the fiend's revengeful hand Upon the trembling edge I stand; But sav'd by Heaven, recall my erring feet, And from the yawning gulph with shuddering awe retreat. IV And oft in dreary dells, With midnights' sable mantle clad, He fills the air with piercing yells; And brings to Fancy's view the wretch with tortures mad! Then, when the sufferer, wild with woe, Would arm against himself the blow, Strives to strike home the instrument of death, And from the gasping wound let out the vital breath. V Fair Orb, send forth thy ray; Banish the phrenzied phantom crew, Which round about the demon play, And give the fiend a more distracting hue! Thou hast, soft Beam, no fairy spell The withering power himself to quell; But gloom less terrible thou can'st bestow; And on his woe-struck rage a calmer influence throw! VI Wild Fancy's headlong starts; The laugh convuls'd, the frantic stare; The scream that thro' the welkin darts; And threats of withering sound, that shake th' affrighted air, From me, O Heaven, in mercy chase! Mine be Despair's more sullen face; And let no transient shapes of Hope appear, To make the hues of Woe by contrast more severe! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. DEDICATION TO A NOVEL, 1802. THE AUTHOR TO HIS BOOK. Child of my brain, fond imp, who many a day, Hast, as I nurs'd thee, sooth'd my cares away, Go forth, and with attemper'd fears await From the world's curious eye, thy doubtful fate! Bred in the shades, whose solitary reign Gives heartsick sorrow leisure to complain, Where no gay objects break th' unvarying hours; Where Fear before, Regret behind me lours, How in thy growing form could I infuse The brilliant colours of an happier Muse? See Avarice, Fraud, and Perfidy combine Against my ill-plac'd trust the dark design; See âhard Unkindnessâ strain th' âaverted eye,â And âlight with her, see Summer-friendship fly;â Mark Folly's grin, as yonder cap of bells Stands to her view: how far and wide she tells, 'Twas for herself the gingling crown was made; For see her temples by herself array'd! Yet, as the laugh, the demon sought, goes round, Lo! with mad anger how she stamps the ground! Now deep Revenge her bursting bosom fires; With Calumny and Malice she conspires, And calls the fiends of hell, in dire debate, To blast the hapless victim of her hate! 'Tis thus that Care my life to sorrow dooms, And, ere my manhood's past, my strength consumes; Still at my heart the greedy vulture lies; When Morning dawns, his ravenous maw he plies; Nor yet at night, shook from his prey, he flies. But Truth's all piercing lustre shall prevail, And Falsehood waste the venom of her tale! In rural bowers to pass the virtuous day, Far from the crowd where rival passions sway; By intellectual toils my mind to raise, And seek from mental efforts all my praise; Sure will at last the tongue of Slander charm, And Hell's malignity itself disarm! For not with Hate my trembling breast is fraught; Far other throes has tearful Feeling taught; Soft to the mild, tho' to the clamorous loud; Humble to meekness, tho' to insult proud; Prompt to forgive, if ready to resent, E'en when the anger's just, I soon relent! Awake then, Hope! No more by wrongs opprest, Beneath these clouds of Sorrow I shall rest; But long o'erwhelm'd by undeserved blame, Tried by Adversity's relentless flame, With sufferings, and âwith dangers compass'd round,â Shall purer from the searching fire be found! Sept. 6, 1802. SONG. FROM A NOVEL. WRITTEN IN THE CHARACTER OF A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF SIXTEEN, IMMURED IN AN OLD DESERTED MANSION, IN A SOLITARY COUNTRY. I I see the bud open; I hear the bird sing; The flutter of joy's on the tree; The lambs of the valley all frisk in a ring; The lowing herds greet the arrival of Spring; All Nature is laughing save me! I I have no one, to whom I can pleasure impart; I have no one my converse to share; This solitude chills all the flow of my heart; And my breast with regrets of more venomous dart These figures of cheerfulness tear! III O why am I thus in seclusion immur'd? In secrecy why was I nurst: O wherefore so anxiously am I secur'd? This dull lonely life can no more be endur'd; The bonds of my prison I'll burst! IV I have heard the owl hoot; I have heard the ghost shriek, And the storm shake the tower and the tree; I have cower'd round the fire, when my lips dar'd not speak; But like these, sure no trials my spirits could break, When all are delighted save me! LINES WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARTING FROM A LADY. I She is gone! The occasion for ever is past! How each step, as it brought me too near to the last, Still gave a new rend to my heart! âThree moments to fly,â to my bosom I said, âThree moments, and then the occasion is fled, âThe concern of thy life to impart!â II Woe is me! She is gone! My too fluttering breast, That scarce knew what 'twas doing, the words half exprest, And âBe mineâ on my tongue died away! âBe mine!â at the thought the tear stood in my eye; And confus'd as I was, she perchance knew not why, Came the time she no longer might stay! III She is gone, and she knows not the pangs that I feel! Perhaps, if she did, the dear angel might heal The wounds that her beauties have made! She might smile!âBy the gods, how I'd bless her dear smile; She might say, âAs your words seem devoid of all guile, âI will trust I shall not be betray'd!â IV âBy the Father of Heav'n,â from my heart I'd reply, âIf all that I speak, that I write, look, or sigh, âIs as warm as the love in my breast, âMay my right hand its office forget, and my truth âNe'er again be believ'd, but the bud of my youth âWith infamy wither opprest!â V She is gone! had she heard me thus utter the vow, Perchance she had deign'd a kind look to bestow, And a tear had returned to mine! Her kind heart with pity had view'd my distress, And, like angels enjoying the pleasure to bless, Perchance she had said, âI'll be thine!â VI âI'll be thine!â O what rapturous accents to me! Tears had gush'd from mine eyes, and I'd fallen on my knee, And bless'd her a thousand times o'er! Perdition revenge me, if ever my voice, Or my heart, for the kindness to me in her choice, Forgot the dear maid to adore! VII But she's gone! Where, O where am I straying? I dream! O Fancy, with what airy plans dost thou teem! She is gone, and has heard not my woes! She is gone, and it was not my angel that smil'd; 'Twas her shade my idolatrous fancy beguil'd! On delusion my raptures arose! VERSES INSCRIBED IN A BOOK, A LEGACY TO A VERY YOUNG LADY, Now wife of the Rev. Henry Rice. FROM PHILIP ABBOT, AN OLD MAN, WHO HAD BEEN A SERVANT IN HER FAMILY, AND DIED, AGED 96, MARCH 1782. Oct. 1782. When a few moons (heav'n grant the lot!) have shed Their ripening lustre o'er thine infant head; And Shakespear's page, my Lucy, shall unroll To thy rapt sight the mirror of the soul; There, 'mid his scenes with thousand colours fraught, Old Adam shall enchant thy wond'ring thought. Such was the man, who bad thy mother bear This small memorial to thy future care: From youth to age her grateful house he serv'd, Nor from strict Virtue's path a moment swerv'd. When life's dark winter, as it 'gan to lower, Blasted his sight, and bound up every power For active good, yet many a lengthen'd day With meek content he smil'd beneath its sway; And still with kindest thoughts his time beguil'd, And blest the race, for whom he once had toil'd: Till ninety years being past in measure even, He sail'd with conscious triumph up to heaven. He had been blind for more than thirty years. Dr. Egerton brought him, when a boy, from the neighbourhood of his rectory at Settrington in Yorkshire. In the latter part of his life he paid an annual visit to the residence of the author's father, where, notwithstanding his loss of sight, he could walk alone both about the house and the garden. VERSES ON THE LATE UNANIMOUS RESOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION. WRITTEN DEC. 19, 1792. Hark! 'tis the shout of joy that meets my ear; And Concord's plaudits shake the echoing sphere! âLong live our glorious King!â And long may live The blessed days that Law and Order give! And may our children's children still enjoy The sacred fence, that villains would destroy; And ages hence in peace and plenty smile Beneath the shelter of the noble pile! Mark how Sedition's clam'rous tongue is drown'd! Mark how his looks his frustrate schemes confound! Mark how the guilty Plunderer scowls to find His golden visions vanish'd like the wind! Mark how the Murderer grins, since now no more He hopes to wash his savage hands in gore! And Envy foul, and disappointed Pride In sullen gloom their dreams would vainly hide, O'er their Lords' necks with cruel taunts to ride! O hail to Britons' generous hearts! that brave All storms, the cause of Liberty to save; But, still to Wisdom and to Order true, Licence and Anarchy with hate pursue! O meliorated scheme, that Time has drawn From many a struggle past, and peril gone; From Wisdom acting on the deeds enroll'd Of many a wondrous Sage, and Warrior bold! O Constitution, with more power endued To curb the Vicious and protect the Good, Than e'er the page of Hist'ry told before! And shall we prize your happiness no more?â O civil Policy, whose power prescribes Riches and safety to Barbarian tribes; That from the woods the houseless wanderer calls To the sweet shelter of surrounding walls; From where, o'er scanty and uncertain food, Naked and shivering half their hours they brood; Or o'er drear wilds throughout the tedious day With endless toil pursue the needful prey; To the warm vestment; to the cheerful dome, Where sure of safety each commands his home; Where still the bread, that wholesome Toil may get, In peace his little tribe may round him eat! O Policy! not only such thy praise! Mankind to higher bliss thou yet can'st raise! To touch the heart, to feed th' ethereal flame, That seeks by polish'd arts immortal fame; Manners to soften, soothe the maddening strife, And teach the sweet civilities of life, 'Tis thine, blest Power!âand thine to scatter round The useful splendor, with which Wealth is crown'd! Hence Labour finds employ; the Poor are fed; The industrious Artist's board's with plenty spread; Hence Commerce lifts her sails; and hence explores The world's wide circuit for its varied stores! Guarded by thee, sweet Policy, by thee! The fruits that, borne o'er many a dangerous sea, Months of sad peril and long toil employ'd, In peace securely are at home enjoy'd; Guarded by thee, the Swain who tills the ground, In safety sees his harvest ripen round; Nor o'er the spoils of savage clans he weeps, But the same seed he sows, himself he reaps! Guard as thou art then, guarded may'st thou be By future ages resolute as we! May Justice wave her sword, if Faction rise, And stop th' audacious Coward's treacherous lies! Woe be the day, that sees the Villain lead Destruction's hell-hounds to the rueful deed, When all that's fair, and all that's wise, must fall, And Waste and Desolation cover all! Ne'er may I see the hour!âbut should my doom Lengthen my life till such a conflict come, May the first sword be pointed at my breast, And in the quiet grave secure my rest! VERSES UPON ANCIENT MANSIONS. These were written for a friend, as part of the Preface of the second volume of the Topographer, and were accordingly published in that work. Hail, ye bold turrets, and thou reverend Pile, That seem in Age's hoary vest to simile! Thou noble Arch, thro' which the massy gate Opes to yon Hall in slow and solemn state, All-hail! For here creative Fancy reads Of ages past the long-forgotten deeds; Tales wrote in magic marks thy walls among, By Time's swift current as it pass'd along. Hail, virtuous race! whose Sires from age to age, The gay and grave, the Soldier and the Sage, Here, where you still in happy peace abide, Caught their first breath, and here in quiet died! Yes here the bold Crusader from his toils Return'd t' enjoy his long-lost children's smiles: Yon pictur'd window, where the doubtful light Bursting thro' mellow panes enchants the sight, Rais'd by his hand with Glory's honest flame, Shews the bold Cross the emblem of his fame; That Cross which still with spirit undecay'd Against the cruel Spaniard was display'd, When Raleigh led his bands from shore to shore, New worlds with dauntless courage to explore. Yon old hereditary trees, that spread Their rude luxuriant umbrage o'er your head, Their grateful shade, two hundred summers past, O'er the soft slumbers of your Fathers cast! O ye wild dells, ye hills with beeches crown'd, Ye opening lawns, that yonder pales surround; Within whose circuit, still alarm'd with fear, At every quivering leaf-fall, leaps the deer; And unrestrain'd by modern bounds, to find His ancient ranges shoots before the wind! Ne'er may the Stranger, rais'd by lawless gain, Disturb the peaceful Lords of your domain, Pollute these haunts by cruel rapine won, And ope your hallow'd umbrage to the Sun! But the same race, that blew the bugle horn Along these echoing woods, to cheer the morn, When the fourth Harry heard the lively call, And grac'd your lord in yonder feastful Hall, May the same virtuous race your echoes court, Pursuing still th' hereditary sport, And roam in summer suns, or rest, beneath Your lovely shades, and catch your fragrant breath; And, still in death the same desires to keep, In yon low chapel with their fathers sleep! DESCRIPTION OF ELLEN ST. AUBYN. FROM AN UNFINISHED STORY. WRITTEN IN 1784. In Truth, she was a wondrous beauteous dame, As e'er was sounded by the trump of Fame! Slight was her form, and tall; her taper waist Was short; its circuit small a girdle grac'd; And from her milkwhite garment's wavy flow, Her slender ancle sweetly shone below: White her plump hands, and soft round-rising arms, Whose blue meand'ring veins increas'd their charms; But more her opening bosom caught the sight; Firmly it swell'd, and beam'd forth rapt delight; As polish'd marble smooth; as driv'n snow 'twas white: And most the blooming beauties of her face, Her cheek's soft roses, and her forehead's grace; (This white as lilies; those of livelier hue Shone fresh as in the fields, when dipt in dew;) Her ivory teeth; and chief, her soften'd eyes, Like Cynthia's beams, which gently light the skies, With more than mortal bliss the gazer fill'd; While her light auburn locks, that sweets distill'd, Around her neck, and cheeks, and forehead play'd Luxuriant, and diffus'd a varied shade, Whose tints divine no painter e'er essay'd! ELEGY, WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER 1782. TO MRS. LEFROY, OF ASH, IN HAMPSHIRE. Ere yet in Cam's dull walks and croaking schools, She faint beneath cold Reason's chill embrace, My Fancy pants one favouring hour to rule, And weave a wreath my sister's hair to grace. Sweet nightingale, since I like thee with song, While others slumber, sooth the night away, Oh! give thy power to lead the heart along, Thro' the soft thrillings of the plaintive lay! Then as I bid the fairy fabric rise, Of prattling Infancy again to view, My melting voice from every list'ner's eyes, Shall call forth pensive Memory's pearly dew. For well, my Sister, claim those boyish days, The softest strain my feeble powers can give, And well dost thou deserve my warmest lays, If any lay of mine may hope to live! Twas then, if ever in this world of woes She deign'd to rest, that bliss indeed was mine, And then, if ever in my breast it rose, To light the flame of rapturous thought was thine! Ere yet my infant feet had strength to stray, Dryads and Wood-nymphs caught me in their arms; With them explor'd I every cave by day, And all their wildest haunts, secure from harms. By glimmering twilight, list'ning to thy tale Of ghosts and goblins round the hearth we hung, And thought we heard their voice in every gale, And started as the Fays the death-bell rung. With some strange story, constant as the night, By thy lov'd voice my frame to sleep was laid, When mimic Fancy rose at Reason's flight, And with redoubled force each scene display'd. But when thy footsteps led me to the Fane, Mid thickest woods embower'd from vulgar eyes; (Where as they watch'd in dell and narrow lane, From their green beds the peeping Nymphs would rise,) That Fane where Poesy, resistless dame, In melting state has plac'd her rosy throne, My' enchanted soul quick caught th' ethereal flame, And vow'd eternal love to her alone. Blest be the hour, beyond all others blest, That saw me captive in the fair one's arms, And every blessing crown my sister's breast, Who taught my youth to prize her lasting charms! This most lovely, most accomplished, and most excellent woman, died by a fall from her horse, in December 1804. EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, ON A VISIT IN LINCOLNSHIRE, AUGUST 9, 1784. ON THE PLEASURES OF VICISSITUDE. This Poem is an attempt to imitate the freedom, variety, and energy of Dryden's Rhythm. ?! My Muse, to thee, whom most I prize, At Friendship's altar lights her sacrifice. Thou dear companion of my early days, To thee from childhood was I wont to raise My voice, and fear thy blame, and love thy generous praise! Tho' harshness in my rugged lines displease, Yet mellowing time shall make them flow with ease; For when the Fancy's flame, and force of thought, A deeper energy of soul have wrought, Then varied like my mind shall pour along The strong, yet tuneful current of my song. But now when manhood scarce has strung my nÃ©rves, When every power too oft to Pleasure swerves; How shall I tell thee all I think and feel? E'en now I see thee from the circle steal, In some lone spot to feed thy restless soul, That scorns by vulgar barriers all controul; And longs to fly to other worlds, and bursts beyond the goal! But mortal powers, for flights so daring weak, Must soon descend, and humbler pleasures seek: Some beauteous maiden now, (for Beauty e'er Twin'd with my thoughts, in all will have its share), I see thee tending; in her converse sweet, For wearied powers to find a soft retreat; With the smooth cheek to feast the raptur'd sight, To watch the beaming eyes with fond delight; Be sometimes yours, and sometimes be it mine! For that dear pleasure, I can ne'er resign. Vicissitude, oh lov'd Vicissitude, Thou bring'st the soul with zest for joy endu'd; Thou giv'st the rapture to the lonely hour, And to the social, thou its kindling power! E'en now from thought intent, and inward light, As bursts on yonder yellow fields my sight, With double joy the golden scenes delight: The influence thine, more fresh the scenes arise; Inspiring Autumn, with her gleaming skies, And all her merry harvest-train, comes dancing to my eyes. And now perchance, as Fancy points, my friend, While his slow steps thro' evening homeward bend, From gothic castles, and majestic walls, From gloomy gateways, and from echoing halls; Spies some warm cot, and owns thy influence there! What double raptures in his eyes appear, To find content, and Peace, and Mirth within Those little walls, so low, so weak, and thin! Yes, lov'd Vicissitude, and e'er may he His taste for pleasure quicken'd find by thee! From social intercourse, and social good, Seek the pure pleasures of the lonely wood; Thence plum'd his feathers, fly again to man, By practice strength'ning what his thought began! In constant pleasure if desire we steep, The palled powers in dull stagnation sleep: E'en the dear idol, for whose fancied joys We'd lose the world, in full possession cloys! May I, (nor smile, my friend, tho' varying schemes Of life with me are fickle as my dreams,) May I, in life some gently active part, Enough the joys to heighten of my heart, ChooseâWhether steering in the toils of Law; Or wishing silent Senate's ears to draw! Whate'er my fate; in bliss, or in distress, If Power adorn me, or if Want depress; Thee still my friend, (may heav'n but grant me thee Thro' life!) my anchor shall I find to be! May I, thro' many a year's improving round, Whatever fortune shall thy wishes bound, As firm, and faithful still to thee be found! Adieu! may Beauty's eyes, and soothing power Fill the sweet void of thy vacation hour! But mark the lessons of my thoughtful lyre, Think not, what pleases now, will never tire! EPITAPH. FROM MARY DE CLIFFORD, 1792. Here rest the bones of one, whose ancient race Ages have seen in this sequester'd place, Remov'd from courtly vice, and vulgar strife, Lead the sweet tenor of their peaceful life. Not that, whene'er their country's good might call, Int'rest could check, or danger could appall; For oft in arms, across the billowy main, Proud France has seen them on her conquer'd plain: For Freedom check'd, or Royal Power enslav'd, Domestic furies often have they brav'd; And often has the British senate rung With the bold thunder of their honest tongue! But soon to native fields they lov'd to fly, Where their own trees might o'er their slumbers sigh: There no vile passions thro' the troubled day Drive Fancy, Charity, and Peace away, Nor Folly's noise, nor Envy's haggard form Tear the vex'd bosom with perpetual storm. A cheerful course of lengthen'd life they kept, Then here in quiet with their fathers slept. VERSES ON ANCESTRY, AND A COUNTRY LIFE. FROM MARY DE CLIFFORD. O ye, who in your ancient mansions dwell, On upland lawn, green plain, or quiet dell, Proud of your Fathers' glories! let not Guile From those sweet scenes seduce Contentment's smile; Let Grandeur flash, and Ostentation's eye Look, as it glances, for the envious sigh; Let Folly spend, and Indian riches blaze, Scorn'd or unnotic'd to your wiser gaze! Long have black vices mark'd Ambition's road, While tortur'd Conscience haunts his false abode.â Forth let them come from city and from town, In modish manners boast their brave renown, Vain of their present splendour; while the past 'Neath a dark veil of feign'd contempt is cast! Ah! see the puny upstarts of a day, Rise to insult, and flatter to betray; While ye, alas! ye foolish, and ye vain! Leave your own posts to pert and low disdain! Oh wake, nor let the specious plea prevail, While the low villain boasts the generous tale; Scorn the proud scorner, let the long lov'd name Of your dead fathers holy reverence claim; Boast how they led a life of cheerful ease, Beneath their own hereditary trees; That far from all that's low and mean, and bred By rural Virtue, all their moments fled; Nor nurs'd in mobs, nor yet from Knavery's school, They stemm'd thro' crimes and blood to wealth and rule! DEDICATION TO A NOVEL, 1799. TO ?, A. M. OF HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP ?, OFF THE NILE. âWhence come these plaintive tones of discontent, These sorrowing murmurs cross the Ocean sent? Why, while on Victory's course I mount the prow, As my brave comrades the proud billows plough, For chearing notes of joy, why meets my ear Anger's hoarse voice? why flows Affliction's tear?â 'Tis thus, when first the long-expected sail To Nile's immortal banks shall bear my tale, Friend of my youth, who scorn'st vile flattery's phrase, I seem to hear reproach, instead of praise! But think, since first from boyish trammels freed, On Cam's resounding banks, on Granta's mead, The jocund revels we were wont to lead, How many a grief has spread its mournful hues O'er all my thoughts, and darken'd all my views! Then seem'd, as on my lyre the free notes rang, Fame's laurel chaplet in my reach to hang, And bright behind Futurity's pierc'd shade Hope's airy figures in the sunshine play'd: Then hollow Friendship told the trusted lie, And the tear mov'd in false Affection's eye; Then mad Philosophy conceal'd in smiles, And veil'd with gaudy flowers, her future wiles, Nor yet had once, with distant triumphs warm, Let drop the mask that hid the demon's form! But soon the fairy colours 'gan to fade; Hence the gay vests which Folly's shape array'd, Hence the loud shouts of senseless mirth, the roar Of Bacchanalian orgies, pleas'd no more: The crowded city's din; the idiot rites, In which dull Fashion's votary delights, Disgusted; and to quiet vales I fled, Where winds might whisper music o'er my head. There, in the lap of languid ease, I lay Many a long night and long inglorious day: No titles brightened my ignoble name, No riches lighted up my dying fame, No more the circle list'ned as I spoke, Attracted by some wealthier fool's dull joke: But Pity, the mean coward's insult, fell To ring my vanish'd honour's parting knell. Yet, long uneasy in their ashes kept, The smould'ring fires of former efforts slept. At length I burst Sloth's ignominious chain, And wak'd the long-forgotten lyre again! Then they, who once had triumph'd o'er my fall, Stung with mad anger, nurs'd the rising gall, And Envy, Malice, Calumny, combin'd The deadly draught, to blast my peace of mind! O ye, who still to faith and honour true, Amid retirement's shades, (ye glorious few!) Cherish my voice, my name, with growing love, And in the lowering tempest kindest prove, For you the Muse a lasting wreath shall weave, Of which no time your temples shall bereave! But ye, ye faithless, who in sorrow's hour Shrank from the cloud, and fled the chilling shower; Who thought, while yet I sail'd on Folly's stream, Urg'd the light race, shot the gay chariot's gleam, Spread the rich banquet to a crowd of fools, And liv'd as one of Fortune's sensual tools; Who thought that wisdom issued from my tongue, And boasted kindred as my praise ye sung; Yet, since the Muse revives, and temperate days Nurse my lone studies, far from splendour's blaze, Who hear no eloquence, no sense discern, But with cold cowardly aversion turn; Ye mean! ye stupid! lofty scorn will spare The fate ye merit, and your names forbear!â Then think, my friend, in what impervious clouds Black Care my melancholy prospects shrouds, O'er scenes, which genial suns in vain illume, Impends, and throws an universal gloom; âSheds browner horrors o'er the frowning woods, Deepens the murmurs of the winter floods,â Pope's Eloisa to Abelard, ver. 169, 170. And, chilling all the Muse's boyish fire, Bids none but plaintive notes escape the lyre! Think and forgive, nor let reproach again Pervade thy bosom at the mournful strain! So shall the friendship, which, with ray serene, Has warm'd our breasts in every varying scene Of life's tempestuous ways, from earliest youth To the last hour, retain its equal truth! LINES, WRITTEN ON THE RECOLLECTION OF ?, HIS NATIVE PLACE, BY F.H. ESQ. 1792. FROM A NOVEL. âSweet native spot! at thy long-cherish'd name Again awakes the Muse's dying flame: It wakes, and lights me to thy 'tangled shades, Thy groves umbrageous, and thy leaf-strown glades; Thy hills, from whence the blue horizon round, With distant spires, and towers, and seas, is crown'd; Thy glens, where, deep-retir'd, my childish days Too oft were spent in dreams of future praise!â All rise, and, colour'd in thy fairy light, Are bodied forth before my ravish'd sight, Bright as when first upon my tender mind The deep-hued forms of Nature were design'd.â But, oh! my soul! though bright each object's hue, Does Joy again salute thee at the view? Have years departed, though they yet bespeak No silver hairs, no furrows on my cheek; Say, have they past, nor left behind a sting, Regret's sharp poison o'er their charms to fling?â Thou spreading oak, beneath whose branches dark My childhood wont sweet Nature's voice to mark; To see the golden orb at morning rise, And watch its crimson fall with wistful eyes; Why at thine image is my beating breast With grief and pensive discontent opprest?â Ah! now hoarse hollow murmurs meet my ear; And thus the deep reproach I seem to hear! âWhy was thine infant mind each rural sight Form'd to receive, and tremble with delight? Why thus thy heart to beat, to thrill, to glow, And feel with keener anguish ev'ry woe? Oh why, while stretch'd beneath my cov'ring shade, Were forms aÃ«rial to thy view display'd? Why did such visions wild thy soul entrance, And fairy circles to thy fancy dance? To waste in restless indolence the day, Or seem 'mid Mirth's loud sons, while mournful, gay? In courts to bow, in forums to dispute, 'Mid Folly's thoughtless talkers to be mute? With fault'ring voice, and looks that speak the fool, Helpless to sit, while Dulness gives the rule? To rival country squires, and city beaux, To seek the palm the chase or course bestows? To vie with those, whose hard unfeeling heart Can the sure pow'r of Victory impart? The paths of mawkish Dissipation run; To ride, to drive, to gameâto be undone? Ah, no! Far other hopes thy youth design'd! To try the nobler contests of the mind! The trembling motions of the heart to trace; And catch the beauteous hues of Nature's face! Thy talent wasted, how wilt thou atone The flagrant crime before Heaven's awful throne! Ere yet old Age upon thy fancy lours, Weakens thy hopes, and freezes all thy pow'rs, The flying moments seize; the path pursue That opes Fame's purer chaplets to thy view!â Enough, lov'd Tree! Ah, now the murmurs close! The shadowy branches hang in deep repose! Then once more, O ye boughs, whose soothing gloom Can with fresh vigour imp the Muse's plume, Cherish the dreams, that fir'd my childish brain, And bring a just ambition back again!â LINES WRITTEN IN THE CHARACTER OF THE HERO OF A NOVEL, 1798. âO Hark! See Ruin enters! By his side O view the gaunt relentless fiends that ride! See Peculation, and Perverted Law, And bloated Wealth, whom hounds of Murder draw; Extortion, mounted on the pamper'd steed, Which the last tears of starv'd Misfortune feed; And black Malignity, all drest in smiles; And Avarice, striving to conceal his wiles: And yet an hundred harden'd imps behind, That feast upon the sorrows of Mankind! Hark, they approach!âYe fiends of Hell, away!â Dear native fields, ye must not be their prey! Shades of my fathers, which the circling Sun, As twice three centuries his course he run, Has seen, in safety, o'er the faithful head Of the same race, your antient umbrage spread! Shall cruel hands pollute your dark retreats? Shall Infamy defile your sacred seats? Ye lawns, on which my happy childhood play'd; Ye paths, where first my infant footsteps stray'd; Ye boughs, which first I twisted into bowers; Ye primrose banks, where first I pick'd your flowers; Your long-lov'd charms shall foreign masters own? Shall foreign ears insult your slighted moan? Along your silent copses, and your dells, Shall puff'd-up Folly shake her cap of bells? In name of Taste direct the axe's blow? Laugh at your shrieks, and lay your glories low? Ye towers, that long have rais'd your heads sublime, Firm and unshaken 'mid the storms of Time! Ye halls, that oft with echoing sounds have rung, When the rude minstrels tales of heroes sung; When Feast, and Hospitality, and roar Of Mirth went round, the genial goblet o'er; Where still the blazing hearth, at Christmas-tide, The frost and snow, and wind and rain, defy'd; And Ease at loaded boards, the village crew, Still to their lord in closer union drew! Ye rooms, where poets nurs'd their golden dreams; Where statesmen fram'd their country's glorious schemes; Where wits their brilliant rays were wont to dart; And Beauty's radiant forms to melt the heart! Shall the coarse upstart wretch, who never knew A thought beyond the figur'd spells, that drew The needy to Destruction's net, display, Within your sacred walls, a scoundrel's prey; New sentiments; new modes of life unfold, Corrupt with luxury, and blast with gold!â Great God of Mercy! since it is a crime, To end this wretched life before its time; If the dire fiends at yonder gate I view, Be not mad Fancy's forms, but shapes too true, O now direct the pitying dart of Death, And in my native forests close my breath!â LINES BY A.F. ON THE TIMES. FROM A NOVEL, 1798. Black scowls the sky; descends the drizzling rain; In mournful tones the hollow winds complain; And over every scene her sable wings The sombre goddess Melancholy flings. My bosom catches the contagious woe; And sadness only from my lips will flow. Where are my youthful dreams, my joyous days, My name with honours crown'd, my head with bays? Fled, like all visions!âVanish'd is the veil; And what a group behind of spectres pale, Grim-visag'd shapes, and grinning forms, appear! See broken-hearted Grief, and trembling Fear; And wan Neglect, and shivering Want, and Scorn, And black-brow'd, blood-stain'd Malice; Shame forlorn; And iron-fang'd Extortion; and mad Strife; Hold the sole sway o'er every path of life! O whither shall I bend my aching eyes! Where shall I find less frightful prospects rise! From scenes of private sorrow let me turn, The comforts of the public weal to learn! There bankrupt nations; bleeding monarchs there; And famine end the people murders spareâ Cities laid low there civil discord scourge, And Ruin o'er the whole her plough share urge, Affrighted I behold!âand shake with awe, As the dire dÃ¦mons near and nearer draw!â My Country, O my Country! that, sublime, Hast borne thy head above the waves of time, Which, as they beat against thy mighty shores, New bulwarks brought, in wisdom's added stores! At length thy fate approaches: omens croak, And hollow sounds portend the coming stroke; Trembles the ground; and hideous birds of prey Cross us by sits, and shrieks of joy betray!â âChiefs in command, who would outstand the storm, And call new props, and new defences form, Beware, ye thoughtless, how ye draw your aid From quarters, which, if weak and open laid, New breaches to the furious blast will shew, Till unsuspected comes destruction's blow. Props of the state, your ancient gentry gone, By whom, in easy cords of union drawn, A virtuous useful peasantry, content, Their toils industrious to the public lent; From whom, the mind enlarg'd, the lofty soul, By birth and study freed from base controul Of griping avarice, and selfish gain, Rises, a senate's glory to maintain, What shall the loss supply?âFrom yonder seas, Mark the gay vessel drive before the breeze; See on the shore the gorgeous Nabob land; The wealthy cargo blackens all the strand;â Oh mark! the sallow wretch, tho' dress'd so gay, Leaves prints of blood he cannot wash away! He comes to feed our wants, our lands to buy; Of making laws the labor to supply; Gold palaces to build, and wide to throw The doors of feast, and revelry, and show; The narrow bounds of neighbourhood destroy, And thro' a county spread the general joy! Nor yet contented: lest Profusion pour Too deeply from th' incalculable store, Plutus Late events will probably make the intelligent reader smile at this.âBut Avarice frequently defeats itselfâ200,000l. gained by a single speculation, added to possessions already amounting to 300,000 l.âand all sunk in the fathomless abyss of this demon! Yet such things are! 23 Feb. 1799. he re-invokes; and now to kings His loans of millions the sharp usurer brings, Till what exhausted India's shrieking plain With rapine, famine, and with blood to gain, Seem like light baubles, which his scorn excite, To think they e'er could fill his appetite!â Then wakes the lute of Merriment again, And breathes seduction o'er the listening plain; Then healthy Competence, and Labor strong, Lords of themselves no more, admire the song; And village-beauty, for the charms of dress, Yields to the swarthy wretch a loath'd caress. The echoing hall, which pendant honours grace, For many an age the trophies of the chace, And prouder still, the mighty spoils of war, Won in old days with many a glorious scar, Despis'd, deserted, and the homely board, Which once could hospitable joys afford, Scorn'd, till the generous heart, to fame a prey, Opes all its veins, and bleeds its life awayâ The echoing hall, in many a fragment rude Wide o'er the weed-grown dreary vill is strew'd; And fields, that nurs'd heroic chiefs, and fed Full many a hardy soldier, whom they led, No more at industry's or honor's call, Lifeless to the all-grasping monster fall!â Then, proud, the new-sprung lord in bloated power O'er a whole county bids his palace tower, While as its glittering heights assail the sky, Thro' the wide tracks, beneath its ken that lie, Nought but the vile hut of the lonely hind, Rude and half-cloth'd, the searching eye can find. At length the bubble bursts: th' aÃ«rial pile, Built on the basis of extorted toil; Of trade, where after all the peril o'er, Another comes, and seizes half the store,â Sinks,âand the tight-drawn cord of union broke, Kingdoms rush headlong at a single stroke! LINES TO THE MEMORY OF A DECEASED FRIEND. FROM A NOVEL, 1802. Departed Spirit! While the grave contains Within its chill embrace thy poor remains, Thou, if the groveling wanderers here below May aught of future fate presume to know, Pure, and by intellectual toils refin'd, The choirs of heavenly habitants hast join'd! Look downwards, and behold with pitying eye The strugglers in this vale of misery! In strength unequal still behold thy friend With power unjust, and perjur'd wealth contend; O'er his tumultuous breast thy influence spread, And bring soft slumbers to his restless bed; With fortitude inspire him to withstand Terror's loud threat, Oppression's iron hand; And yet undaunted, where his cause is true, E'en in the face of Ruin, Right pursue! Perchance thou hear'st him not;âthou may'st not hear! Alone, unaided, I am doom'd to bear The worldly trial! Holy Shade, adieu! Be mine to dress thy grave with garlands new; And oft the turf to moisten with my tears; While fresh thy once-lov'd form again appears, And thy soft voice seems, waken'd from the tomb, To sooth with Wisdom's lore my mournful doom! LINES WRITTEN IN THE CHARACTER OF THE HERO OF A NOVEL, 1802. In this still vale, where o'er my deep repose The murmuring wind its drowsy music blows; Where thro' the day my half-clos'd eyelids view Forms flit before them of enchanted hue, Which yet unheeded on my lazy mind, Pass like a cloud, and leave no track behind; At friendship's call I still my voice must raise, Sieze the neglected pen, and tune my lays! But where's the fire, that bade my boyish breast, Till Fame's high hill was mounted, never rest? Feebly it burns, tho' Age's vapoury cloud Has not begun its dying fires to shroud; Nor yet the tottering pace, the hoary hair, The wither'd current of my blood declare. Over its mounting heat Disgust has shed Cold drops of poison, and the blaze is fled; And Disappointment touch'd it, and it shrunk; And Grief's pale clouds o'ershadow'd, and it sunk! By foes so numerous press'd, ah, when again Will its gay spirit prompt th' impassion'd strain? Perchance, O never!âBut the awful close Of life will bring me to the grave's repose, And still this trembling heart, and veil these eyes, From whence too oft the flash of Anger flies, Ere Hope once more the chearful hours illume; Or Fancy once again dispel the gloom! But e'en amid these chilling damps I crave One sprig of laurel for my early grave! Still I aspire not quite unknown to die, While Friendship's aid shall partial tears supply. These idle lays then, which the vacant hour Can by a feeble half-fram'd effort pour, Wilt thou, receive, my Henry; nor require Where Grief incumbent sits, the Muse's fire? But, hark! the lulling murmur of the blast, That sooth'd my fancy's languid dreams, is past! Loud was that shriek, that came across the grove! See, how the forest's trembling honours move! Haste! let me seek old Ocean's foamy shore; And listen to the big wave's gathering roar! O, how I love the fighting billows' roll; How the loud tumult suits my troubled soul! I seem once more my wonted fire to gain; And without effort comes the impassion'd strain! On the tall cliff's tremendous verge I lie, And watch the clashing waves that threat the sky; While from afar I trace the swelling surge, Near and more near the wat'ry mountain urge; Till forc'd against the opposing land, that quakes E'en to its very inmost base, it breaks; And with a sound, that seems to shake the world, Thro' air, earth, sea, the wat'ry mass is hurl'd. These are the mighty scenes my spirit loves: I hate the peaceful glen, the murmuring groves! The stockdove's plaintive note, the nightingale, That to the happy lover tells her tale, Suit not the chaos of a stormy breast, Whom injuries have wrong'd, and woes opprest! Ask you, my friend, then, when delights like these My wounded soul no longer finds to please, What soothes me next? To see thro' gloomy night The forked lightning dart its fiery light! Or in some rocking tower the tempest brave; And hear the land-storm thro' the forest rave; While the wan Moon, that darkness long enshrouds, Breaking by fits from out the driving clouds, Displays the tossing waters of the lake, That lash its shores, and all its boundaries shake! Then, as at length, the rising waves o'erleap The yielding banks, and pour down every steep, I hear the roaring tumult, and behold Thro' woods and plains the foaming torrent roll'd, And as each ray the spreading wreck reveals, A gloomy joy my grief-torn bosom feels See an extraordinary coincidence of sentiments, and almost of expressions, in parts of this poem, with some passages in p. 97 of Dr. Currie's most interesting and excellent Life of Burns, which the author never saw till (22 June 1801) two days before this sheet was sent him to correct from the press; having before only seen the extracts from that delightul publication, which were inserted in the Reviews.! And dost thou blame me, Henry? Let not Ease 'Taunt him, whom Sorrows and Misfortunes seize! O ye, who down the stream of pleasure ride, Wafted with silken sails along the tide; Whom no winds agitate, no dangers try, Judge not, ye vain, the child of Misery! Him wilder joys for nobler efforts form; In danger most to shine, and glory in the storm! A POETICAL FRAGMENT ON A DESERTED MANSION, THE SUPPOSED PLACE OF NATIVITY OF THE PERSON IN WHOSE CHARACTER IT IS WRITTEN. Ah! poor deserted solitary dome! Thou wast, tho' now so dreary, once my home! From these lov'd windows was I wont to mark The swain at noontide cross the chearful park; And oft as pensive eve began to draw O'er the sweet scene her shadowy veil, I saw The weary woodman thro' the twilight pace, His hearth's domestic circle to embrace! Unnoticed now his mournful path he treads; No casual ray thy gloomy window sheds; From thy chill halls no clouds of smoke appear: No sound of human habitant is here. The angry spirits of the wind alone Shriek thro' thy rooms and 'mid thy turrets groan; While the poor villager, who wont to stay, And near this spot to linger on his way, Now passes fearful on, nor looks around, Starts at each bough; and quakes at every sound! With trembling footsteps I approach thy gates; The massy door upon the hinges grates; Hark! as it opens, what an hollow groan 'Cross the dark hall and down the aisles is thrown! Still as each lov'd apartment I explore, The ghosts glide by of joys that are no more; Cold tremors seize my frame, and to my heart Despair's chill shafts in clouds of sorrow dart! O where are all the crew, whose social powers Speeded beneath these roofs my youthful hours: Some near yon fane, beneath the turfy mound, From worldly cares have early quiet found; Wide o'er the globe dispersed the rest are seen; Vast lands extend, deep oceans roll between. Some in the burning suns of Asia toil To win deceitful Fortune's gaudy smile; Some in the battle's perils spend their breath, And grasp at honour in the arms of death; On Egypt's sandy plains, or 'mid the crew Of mad rebellion still their course pursue; Some to the gentler arts of peace apply, Or with the gown's or senate's labours vie; Watch with the moon thro' midnight's tranquil hour, Learning's exhaustless volumes to explore; Or paint bright Fancy's shadowy shapes, which throng Before the raptured sight, in living song, While fondly as the fairy structure grows With hope of endless fame the bosom glows. But where are they, whose softer forms display'd Beauty in all the charms of youth array'd? Which first the breast with love's emotion fill'd, And with new joys the dove-wing'd moments thrill'd? Here glimmer'd first, amid a thousand wiles, Thro' the deep blush, affection's purple smiles; In murmurs died the voices melting tone, And the heart throbb'd with softness yet unknown. On yonder lawn, in yonder tangled shade, Till twilight stole upon our joys, we played; Danced on the green, or with affected race Pursued thro' winding walks the wanton chase; Or sat on banks of flowers, and told some tale Where hapless lovers o'er their fate bewail; Or bad soft echo from her mossy seat The floating music of their songs repeat! Ye dear companions of my boyish days, Fair idols of my vows and of my lays, O whither are ye gone? what varied fate Has heaven decreed your riper years to wait? The bloom of youth no longer paints your cheeks; In your soft eyes gay hope no longer speaks; Bright as the hyacinthine rays of Morn Your cheeks no more the auburn locks adorn! Some in the distant shades of privacy With watchful looks a mother's care supply; Some in the realms of fashion feed their pride, Wafted on dissipation's vapoury tide: And some alas! ere yet the silver hair And tottering footsteps warn'd them to prepare, Of life's vain course have closed the fickle race, And sudden sunk in chilling death's embrace! But happy they, who, in the quiet grave, The world's relentless storms no more must brave; For here no more had childhood's pure delights Bless'd their sweet days, and hover'd o'er their nights; Here cruel fate had early closed the door, That opens to the voice of joy no more; And still, where'er the wretched exiles stray'd, Black Care had gloom'd their steps, and Fraud betray'd; And Envy scowl'd upon their fairest deeds; And Calumny, that cursed fiend, who feeds With most delight on those, who most aspire To win pure fame by virtue's holiest fire, Had damp'd the ardor of the generous breast, And glory's kindling visions had supprest!â The grave contains them now: beneath a heap Of mouldering turf in silent rest they sleep, Till the dread day when sounds the trump of fate, And all with trembling hope their doom must wait. O ye deep shadowy walks; ye forest-dells, Where solitude with inmost mystery dwells! Again I hail you! From the leaf strown earth Visions of happy infancy spring forth At every step I tread; and to my heart A momentary ray of joy impart: But ah! how soon, with present ills combin'd, The dreadful contrast strikes the wounded mind! The clock that sent its undulating sounds With deep-ton'd stroke thro' all your distant bounds From yonder lofty tower, is silent now; Silent the horn, that on yon airy brow, Blew its shrill notes thro' all your calm retreats, And rous'd the Nymphs and Dryads from their seats; And call'd sweet Echo, bidding her prolong Thro' hill and grove and vale the chearful song: Still is the breath of him who wak'd the horn; The master's tongue, who did these scenes adorn, Is silent in the dust; no more his voice Bids the deep coverts of your woods rejoice; No more the rustics' grateful breasts he chears, Nor wipes from Poverty her bitter tears; No more around him draws the eager cry Of prattling childhood, to attract his eye, From whence the rays of love and kindness fly; No more his lips pronounce the awful tone Of wisdom, and instruct the bad to moan Their guilty course; and virtue still to bear The load of life with fortitude and prayer! Beneath the pavement of yon humble fane Low in the earth his mouldering bones remain. Mem'ry shall o'er the spot her vigils keep, And Friendship and Affection long shall weep; And he, who now attempts, in simple lays, His honour'd fame so weakly to emblaze, Shall never cease, till life its current stays, To love, to speak, to view with idol eyes, His merits kindling as they upward rise! O what a sudden gloom invests the heaven! Black clouds across the fair expanse are driven: No sound is heard; save where a casual breeze Shakes off the rustling leaves from faded trees. Hark! what a gust was that! a fearful moan Along the dark'ning forest seems to groan. Ye holy spirits of my buried sires, Still e'en in death survive your wonted fires? Still hovering round your once lov'd earthly walks, Is it your voice that in the breezes talks? To him who sighs o'er all your glories gone, Who weeps your scatter'd grove, your ruin'd lawn; Who views with bursting heart your falling towers, And fills with loud lament your ravag'd bowers; To him, perchance your guardian cares extend; O'er him perchance with favouring voice ye bend! O hear me, sainted beings of the air, One sign, ye smile upon my efforts, spare! That gust again! louder it seem'd to move, Rushing across the center of the grove! Sure 'tis the signal that ye come at last To calm my breast, and soothe my sorrows past: For long Misfortune's baleful hand has spread Her iron tortures round my luckless head. CÃ¦tera desunt. To Miss L. L. of Iâd. First published in Gent. Mag. Jan. 1784. ON THE AUTHOR'S DEPARTURE, 26 JUNE, 1783. Thou sweet gentle maiden, ere yet I depart, Wilt thou hear the fond feelings, that rise in my heart? Wilt thou hear me, by all that is holy, declare That no time from my memory thine image shall wear? No: when I forget thee, may Fancy expire, And mine awkward hands fail to command the soft lyre! Ah, Lucy! Say wilt thou be pleas'd with these vows, From a youth on whom Fortune no blessings bestows? From a poor simple youth, for the world much too shy, Who from notice of great ones, and rich ones doth fly; Who shines not in circles, nor bustle enjoys, But loves the far valley, remote from all noise? Ah, wilt thou above the vain shew and parade, Whose dazzle too often thy sex has betray'd, Of a fond faithful lover not scornfully deem, Who has nought but his lyre to engage thy esteem? Ah, Lucy! I've thought, but perhaps I was wrong, When I press'd thy soft hand, (and the pleasure no tongue Can e'en faintly describe, that then thrill'd thro' my frame) I have thought that thou didst not my happiness blame! When I've gaz'd on thy face, (and Heav'n knows I have gaz'd, Till the tears of delight I scarce hid, that it rais'd) I have thought, but perhaps I'm deceiv'd, that the love, Which my eyes ill concealed, thou didst not reprove! Ah, me! the sad moment of parting is near, When these exquisite joys I no longer may share; When no more I with thee the swift hours may beguile, And hear thy sweet converse, and bless thy soft smile; When no more thy dear arm upon mine e'er will lean, As we homeward return by the mild light of E'en; When no more I may have the enjoyment divine, To sit for whole hours with thy hand within mine! Ah, say, dearest Lucy! from thee when I go, What pleasure, that's equal to these, shall I know? âI must fly to thick shades; and there wander alone, And brood on the thoughts of delights that are gone! DIRGE, 1783. The preceding lines having been said to be the production of a fictitious person, this Dirge was written upon his supposed death. I Ye Virgins, come, meet round his tomb, And scatter wild flowers on the ground; O sooth, with a tear for his doom, His spirit, that hovers around! II Oft he said, that with pleasure he'd die, From your eyes if 'twould gain him a tear; And surely ye will not deny, Now he's gone, such a due to his bier! III Come, âPeace to his ashes,â invoke, For to sing of your charms was his pride! His heart was so tender, it broke; And he bless'd you, for you tho' he died! IV By yon little spire, from the glade Peeping forth, where he oft was inspir'd, His pale bones in quiet are laid, From the world's evil haunts far retir'd! V Yes, quiet he lov'd, while on earth; From all tumult and noise he would fly: May no worldling with unhallow'd mirth Approach where his ashes do lie! VI Sweet Virtue with fondness he priz'd, From her paths tho' he sometimes might stray; Yet Vice from his soul he despised; And his mind was as pure as the day. VII Ye Maids of the village, draw near; O drop a soft tear on the ground! And Friendship, soft Friendship, appear; And, Fairies, come gather around! VIII Ye Maids, and ye Friends, in the light, From insult protect his cold grave! And, ye Fairies, from harms of the night, O lend your assistance to save! THE GAMEKEEPER'S RETURN AT NIGHT. First published in the Poetical Register. WRITTEN IN 1802. I Thro' the long morning have I toil'd O'er heath and lonely wood, And cross the dark untrodden glen, The fearful game pursu'd: But deeper now the gathering clouds Collect along the sky, And, faint and weary, warn my steps Their homeward course to hie. II And now the driving mist withdraws Her grey and vapoury veil; I mark again the sacred tower I passed in yonder dale: A little while and I shall gain Yon hill's laborious height; And then perhaps my humble cot Will chear my grateful sight! III Ah now I see the smoke ascend From forth the glimmering thatch; Now my heart beats at every step; And now I lift the latch; Now starting from my blazing hearth My little children bound, And loud with shrill and clamorous joy Their happy sire surround. IV How sweet when night first wraps the world Beneath her sable vest, To sit beside the crackling fire, With weary limbs at rest; And think on all the labours past That morn's bright hours employ'd; While all, that toil and danger seem'd, Is now at home enjoy'd. V The wild and fearful distant scene, Lone covert, whistling storm, Seem now in memory's mellowing eye To wear a softer form; And while my wand'rings I describe, As froths the nut-brown ale, My dame and little list'ning tribe With wonder hear the tale! VI Then soft enchanting slumbers calm My heavy eyelids close, And on my humble bed I sink To most profound repose; Save that by fits the scenes of day Come glancing on my sight, And, touch'd by fancy's magic wand, Seem visions of delight! VERSES FROM A NOVEL, 1802. I Now mournfully whistles the wind o'er the grove, And the leaves grown all yellow submit to the blast; Ah! see on the lawn how in eddies they move! Half the shades of the forest already are cast. II Clouds dark and depressing invest all the sky, And by fits cross the vale do the drizzling rains drive; In vain then to check from my bosom the sigh, In vain from my tongue the complaint, shall I strive! III Neglected, traduc'd, and to malice a prey, I bow to the sullen dominion of grief, And tho' long I could charm the dire tyrant away, Oblivion alone can now give me relief. IV My days, my short days, tho' my youth is not fled, Already too surely I feel on the wane; And, ere yet the grey hairs round my temples have spread, Forgot in the grave will my ashes have lain! ELLEN ST. AUBIN. A FRAGMENT OF A POETICAL ROMANCE. I In Richard's days, when many a war-worn knight, From blood-stain'd fields of battles lost and won, Where Europe's troops, array'd in armour bright, Unfurl'd the banner'd cross before the sun, Weary return'd, their race of glory run, The remnant of their days to spend at last In those calm mansions where their lives begun; Where they might muse upon their perils past, And on the gloom of age soft smiles their children cast; II Amid the throng St. Aubin's Baron came, A man, whose generous heart and valiant hand In Salem's fields had gain'd immortal fame: Two years had gone, since first he led his band From Cantia's vallies to the hallow'd land, Stain'd by the infidel's unholy crew; And left his lovely child's caresses bland; His weeping wife's belov'd embraces flew, Mid war on distant plains seek for danger new. III Forth with the peer a neighb'ring chieftain's heir, Young Edmund, who had long for action pin'd, Sallied, the darts of glorious death to dare, And laurels round his boyish brow to bind. A youth he was of truly noble mind, Which in a form as noble was encas'd; Bold as the lion, though as Pity kind; Oft in his fancy he the foe had chas'd, Then in his early dreams the goddess Fame embrac'd. IV Soon as the long array began to move, Joy in his mien, impatience in his eye, Long his triumphant looks to hide he strove: Yet when the beauteous Ellen's form came nigh, Ellen, St.Aubin's only hope, the sigh Rose from his inmost heart; the long farewell The trickling tears could only now supply: Nor dar'd he on futurity to dwell, Nor could the rising thoughts of past enjoyments quell. V Sweet days, how blissful, did they know their bliss! The days of childhood past in pure delight; Th' unfeigned smile, the unimpassion'd kiss, The tear that every toy can put to flight, The careless day, and the unruffled night! Can ever Edmund, by the battle's spoils, The loss of genuine joys like these requite? Where is the palm that equals Ellen's smiles? Ah! where is the reward that thus repays his toils? VI Yet e'en in Ellen's smiles of late infus'd A little bitter ting'd the cup of joy; For on her form no more at ease he mus'd, Nor with her lily hand could safely toy! When absent, still her image would employ His restless fancy An unfinished stanza. VII Nor could the priest, a proud and gloomy soul, Who in the neighbouring abbey dwelt at ease, Who oft in vain had striven to controul The sallies that a lively spirit seize, The wanton raptures of the boy appease: Nor could the youth conceal th' indignant rage Of generous anger, when the priest, to teaze The sweet effusions of a tender age, The dear enchantment chill'd with taunts and maxims sage. VIII Glad had the holy father seen him go; And though with outward pomp and formal prayer He sought of Heaven its blessings to bestow, And make the gallant youth its chosen care, Deep in his heart the inward hate he bare; And while he ask'd aloud that he the wreath Of future glorious victories might wear, His kindest wish was, he might close his breath In distant eastern fields by honourable death. IX Many a fell danger, many an onset fierce Had the bold chief endur'd with dauntless mind: Yet still affection's anxious cares would pierce His inmost heart for those he left behind. Nor had th' array and din of war confin'd His busy thoughts to Asia's crowded plains! For his dear nuptial partner oft he pin'd; Oft in his fancy's eye his daughter reigns; And oft with tears his cheeks her rising image stains. X âO Heaven,â he pray'd, âprotect my faithful wife, While now I fight with thy Barbarian foes! Prolong her virtuous and instructive life To soothe my little Ellen's childish woes; To nourish every virtuous thought that grows In her young bosom, and to guard her heart From the vile hidden thorns that interpose Too oft in outward flowers their cruel dart, And wounds, no future balm can e'er remove, impart!â XI But Heaven or heard not, or Heaven thought not fit To grant the fond request: the mother died; As the last pangs forewarn'd her, she must quit Her lovely charge, âMy dearest child,â she cried, âI go commanded hence; and be thy pride To shew thy mother's cares have not been vain! Let tenderest duty all thy actions guide; And when Heaven's mercy o'er the fearful main Bears thy lov'd father safe, his drooping age sustain!â XII The mournful tidings many a weary day, And many a tedious month were passing slow; Ere yet to end his doubts they found their way, And struck a fatal, e'en though lingering blow. She, who, his hopes had whisper'd, would bestow The crown on all his toils, in silent rest Was with the dwellers of the grave laid low; And all the dreams of future joys, that blest His sanguine fancy, fled from his desponding breast. XIII But time, and busy scenes began to calm His bosom's waves: Affection fond the form Of his sweet child recall'd, to pour a balm Into his wounds, and once again to warm His hopes, o'erwhelm'd in Sorrow's chilly storm: And when at length, with wreaths of glory bound, Weary he left the tented field's alarm, To seek for rest on Europe's distant ground, New hopes in Ellen's smiles his rising fancy found. XIV Now safely landed on his native shore, Many a long mile the pensive Baron pac'd, And now o'er distant well-known hills once more His castle's glittering towers he faintly trac'd: Joy at the sight and Fear alternate chas'd Each other through his palpitating breast: Now gay in youth a daughter he embrac'd; And now, as boding glooms his mind opprest, His child a lifeless corse his longing arms carest. XV Bolder the turrets rear'd their frowning height, And more distinct the cross-sign'd flag display'd Its flapping streamers to the approaching sight: With beating hearts his little train, array'd In order due, each tedious step upbraid; Till now arriv'd within its inmost bound The very courts their happy steps invade; The horse's hoofs upon the drawbridge sound, And the loud trumpet brays the mighty walls around. XVI Forth sallies from the hall the beauteous maid, And trembling kneels before her father's feet; Her streaming eyes her tender joy betray'd, And her tongue faulter'd, and refus'd to greet Her long-lost parent: but her lips repeat The holy kiss, as, in his arms embrac'd, The weeping Baron's dear caresses meet Fondness unfeign'd, and all the raptures chaste Of pure unmingled love a sire and daughter taste. XVII Now rings the hall with festive rights inspir'd; Down the long tables, rang'd on every side, The war-worn crew, with new sprung spirit fir'd, Their cares and toils and dangers past deride; And still as they repeat their travels wide To list'ning trains who greet their glad return, They long again to stem the spreading tide Of mighty oceans, and again they burn In distant eastern climes th' assailing foe to turn. XVIII High at the top the lovely Ellen sits, While her glad father with uncheck'd delight Hangs on her tender smiles, and oft by fits As the bold youth indulge their raptur'd sight, Temper'd by distance, at the glances bright Of her illumin'd face, her idol-form Sinks in their hearts, and e'en her looks requite The perils of the battle, and the storm; Then wonder, love, and awe at once their bosoms warm. XIX Night came; and toil of body and of mind, And spirits with a thousand feelings worn, The Baron's aged frame had soon consign'd To slumbers deep and sound; but ere the morn Had climb'd the sky, he wak'd; and all forlorn In that lov'd bed the partner of his days Was wont to press, he found his bosom torn With pangs reviv'd, which keener tortures raise; And Grief's new-covered fires with double fury blaze. XX His daughter's soothing voice, and sweet caress Could ill his agonizing sorrow quell, Though much he strove their tumults to repress, And veil in smiles the trickling tears which fell Adown his furrow'd cheeks, and spoke so well What rankling wounds affection's breast can sting! How vain the attempt to charm the solemn knell, That still in Love's immersed ear will ring, E'en though a dearest child her soft enchantment bring! XXI Yet still, as glided peaceful days along, A calm began to steal upon his heart; At Ellen's youthful wiles, at Ellen's song A ray of cheerful light was seen to dart Across his gloomy looks, and thence impart Balm to his thoughts, and from his feeble frame Drive by degrees Regret's consuming smart; Of thrilling joy to spread the tender flame; And back to earthly scenes his far-fled hopes reclaim. XXII Lovelier each hour the blooming maiden grew; Her form with more luxuriant beauty glow'd; Her soft cheeks wore a more enchanting hue; Nor hadst thou, Nature, though thy bounty show'd An outward shape so perfect, less bestow'd In the full gifts of her accomplish'd mind; There melting Sentiment had found abode; There Fancy's rich creations were design'd; There mimic Memory kept her brilliant forms enshrin'd. XXIII O'er his dear charge the rapt St. Aubin hung, With love the Muse herself can ill express; Each morn, in haste impatiently he sprung With Ellen's smiles his longing sight to bless; Each morn within his fond embrace to press Her, who on earth was now his only care; Whose form ador'd e'en if with rude caress The airs of Heaven should visit, he his prayer With tears would upward urge his idol child to spare!!â CÃ¦tera desunt. ELEGY, FROM A NOVEL, 1802. That strain was true; and Fancy has the power To strew with roses life's entangled ways: She to the poet's eye at midnight hour On his lone couch can winning Beauty raise! E'en now I wak'd from blissful moments fraught With visions, which I hail'd in tumults tost; Kiss'd the lov'd object, breath'd the tender thought, And gaz'd in rapture, till my sight was lost. But ah! how soon the envious dawn of day Scatters the sweet creation into air; And leaves the mourner by the soothing lay The dreary hours of restless light to wear: To weep his portion of unmixed grief, For vanish'd hopes, and real woes to sigh; In false companions search for vain relief, And meet with pangs, where'er his footsteps fly? If this is life, O may the quiet grave To his worn bosom bring a long repose; For little longer can it firmly brave The storm, that in each gathering conflict grows. Ah; sure! he feels that soon his weary frame Will find a calm beneath its parent earth, Where vainly Malice will insult his name, While Friendship sanctifies his humble worth. But whose the tears that will embalm his shrine? Will the sweet maiden, whose ingenuous eyes Full oft have shone with pity's beams divine, Weep, that in early youth her favourite dies? For she is soft, as is the vernal rose When full its bosom is of morning dew; And her dear snowy breast with kindness glows, Sweet as the flowers that Summer's pathway strew. E'en now his thoughts on her with rapture dwell, Gaze on her trembling form, her blushing cheek; And her lov'd beauties to the breezes tell; Those charms the conscious breezes will not speak: To her he breathes his sighs; to her he talks, And 'mid the quiet of surrounding shades Revels at ease with her in lonely walks, Where ne'er the world's intrusive eye invades. Yes; such is Fancy's pow'r; she lifts her wand, And all around us fairy visions play: Nor must we blame her, if at her command Life's gloom is gilded by a transient ray. LINES On the figure of a Warrior, dressed in Feudal Armour, his shield adorned with an ancient heraldric coat; a Baronial castle in the back ground, on the highest tower of which is displayed a banner, bearing the same insignia; drawn and presented to the Author by the Rev. C. W. One, who after one and thirty years of uninterrupted friendship, and after having buffeted with the rage of the yellow fever in the Atlantic, and having afterwards visited all the shores of the Mediterranean, and witnessed the horrors and the glories of the tremendous night, which was illuminated by the battle of the Nile, is returned safe to form one of the few props and comforts of the author's life. So shone th' heroic chief in days of old; Fierce was his mien; his limbs of giant mould; Beneath the load of cumbrous armour light, Active he bounded to th' infuriate fight; Broad was his shield, with bold device imprest, And on his helmet frown'd the grimly crest: Yon moated castle's massy walls uprose To frown defiance on his vassals' foes; And o'er that shadowy forest's wide domains, O'er these blue hills, and those extended plains, O'er many a scatter'd vill, and many a town, He rul'd by right, by favour, or renown. Ferocious days, and days of wild alarm, Yet chear'd by many a joy, and many a charm, Which these degenerate times have lost.âFor Power Dwelt with the chief, who own'd the Feudal Tower! Lord of the generous arts, that win command, By noble counsel, or by valorous hand, He knew no rivals in the dastard knaves, Who spring to wealth from Lucre's base-born slaves; Who gain rich lands, and feed luxurious boards, By the vile modes, which groveling Trade affords! Perchance some Knight of more adventrous name His spirit's generous envy might enflame, One, on whose breast with more resplendent fire Beam'd the red cross, or growl'd the lion's ire; Who rode with statelier grace the prancing horse, Or couch'd his quivering lance with mightier force! E'en tho' his heaving bosom swell'd with pain, Aspiring wreaths of equal worth to gain, Still in the grateful strife was glory mix'd, And Virtue's wishes in his heart were fix'd: No wealthy son of Commerce bade him hide Before superior pomp his lessen'd pride, Nor call'd him with insulting sneers to vie In the mean race of arts he scorn'd to try: Honour and rank and wealth he saw await Toils of the wise, and actions of the great; Nor mark'd, where'er before his aching eyes Halls, mansions, castles, palaces, arise, Wretches usurp them, who in darksome cells Won their base spoils by Traffic's hated spells! Rude was the pile, that from th' impending brow Of some steep rock upon the wave below Oft look'd with fearful grandeur; loud the blast Rav'd on its walls, and thro' its turrets past; Chill were its sunless rooms, and drear the aisles Along whose length the night-breeze told her tales; Massive the walls, thro' which the genial day Strove with warm breath in vain to win its way: But jocund was its hall; and gay the feast That spoke the genuine gladness of the breast, When rang'd its hospitable boards along, The warlike bands renew'd th' heroic song; Or told wild-tales, or drank with greedy ear Romantic ditties which the Minstrel-Seer Tun'd to his harp, while, as with bolder fire He threw his raptur'd hand across the wire, With visions of new glory beam'd each eye, And loud the gathering chorus rose on high; Till shook the rafter'd roof, and every bound Of the wide castle trembled with the sound. Rough were the scenes, as was the master's mind, Which Nature, bordering on th' abode, design'd; Forests of age untold, whose unpierc'd wood Ne'er to the labourer's echoing axe had bow'd; Soft lawns, which mid surrounding coverts spread, By the wild tenants of the scene were fed; Deep dells, with fern and brake, and twisted thorn, Thick-matted, whence the hunter's shrill-ton'd horn Started th' elastic deer, which, stung with fright, Swift as the viewless winds, pursued their flight; Loud torrents, rumbling as they won their course Thro' fretted rocks and winding banks by force; Or rills, that murmur'd music, as their race Thro' flowery vales they ran with even pace. When War's alarms no more around him rag'd, In sports amid these scenes the Chief engag'd; Sports, that became his hardy form!âWhen Light First 'gan to streak the flying mists of Night, From his rough couch he sprung; his bugle blew, And round him each impatient hunter drew; Then forth the steed of wondrous swiftness came, And thro' the woods he sought th' affrighted game; From morn to eve, woods, plains, and vales and hills With the loud echo of his voice he fills; No toil fatigues him, and no danger stays; Perils the zest of his amusement raise; Then home to gorgeous halls and blazing fires, Weary, yet pleas'd with exercise, retires; The feast is spread; the war-clad walls along Rings the glad converse, and rebounding song; And when again the sable-mantled Night Far o'er the sky has urg'd her heavy flight, On the hard bed his giant limbs he throws, And sinks serenely into deep repose! O age of luxury! O days of ease! The restless, vigorous, soul ye ne'er can please! Within your stagnant lakes Corruption breeds, And on your flowers vile sensual Meanness feeds! As when foul pests have gather'd in the sky And o'er the globe the death-charg'd vapours fly, Soon as the mighty Tempest drives his blasts, And thro' the lurid gloom his lightning casts, Vanish the congregated brood of ills, And health and sunshine all the landscape fills; So, when wan Indolence and timid Joy, The native spirit of the mind destroy, And fiends of Hell, and sprites of loathsome Pain, Self-love, Lust, Gluttony, and Hate, enchain; The toils of war, the battle's thundering storm, The sleepy current of the soul reform; The loaded bosom purge, and bid it flame With the pure throbbings of a generous fame, And light with hope, and airy with the fire Of blest Ambition, up to Heaven aspire! RETIREMENT. First published in Censura Literaria, vol. i.; as was the Fragment ON A DESERTED Mansion, page 153. A FRAGMENT. Ye woods, that underneath your covering wings Hide my tir'd frame, all hail! Here Noise, and Toil, Hollow-eyed base Intrigue, and Envy pale, Black Malice, and envenom'd Calumny, Dare not disturb the silence of your reign: Here I can woo lone Quiet, here collect My scatter'd thoughts, and to my enfeebled mind Call back new vigour; here can re-arrange The forms, that now in wild confusion float On my tumultuous brain. Be present, Muse! And as the mist withdraws, and every thought Takes its due shape before the mental eye, Aid me to paint it in the living song! Greeen fields, and whispering trees, and living streams, And hills and vales, where graze rich herds, and frisk The new-born lambs, before my fancy play. O for the pencil dipt in Nature's hues, Which, guided by sweet Thomson's magic hand, Touch'd with due brilliance all their glowing charms: Or thine, more varied Cowper, in whose strain, Now moral and now gay, now rural scenes Burst with enchantment on the raptur'd sight! Where yonder shepherd's hut, that on the knoll Crown'd by those ancient elms, which overhang Its low thatch'd roof, just peeps, there dwell a race Who see the morning dawn and evening set In all their glories. Thro' the livelong day Heav'n's purest breezes brace their vigorous limbs; Labour makes rest delightful; to coarse fare Keen appetite gives zest; and sound their sleep On the hard pallet, while the rocking winds, That whistle thro' their crazy tenement, But lull them to a more profound repose. For me had Providence that humbler lot Decreed, methinks my days had happier been, Than now to sickly Indolence a prey, Wasting with cares, and torn with worldly wrongs: Then Health had nerv'd my feeble form, and bloom'd My pallid cheek; and in this languid eye Sweet Cheerfulness her dancing rays inspir'd. Gay had I bounded o'er the distant hills, Breasted the piercing blast, or with the wind In equal race contended, unfatigued! O then how grateful had the close of eve Return'd me to my little shed, the hearth Bright-blazing, and the lowly couch of straw! But now, alas, to vain anxiety I wake, and as the minutes drag along, Curse the long day, yet no relief at night Find; for, tho' weary, feverish heats deny Rest to my aching frame; and Sleep aloof Hovers, as if in mockery of my prayers. Ambition treads not in these peaceful haunts, But Innocence is leagued with truest Joy. And what can life afford compared with these? Can rank and riches, splendid palaces, The gaudy equipage, the liveried slave, Appease the anxious cares, the guilty pangs, That lurk within the heart; or lull to rest Corporeal sickness?âShort, alas, the reign Of worldly greatness! Death comes unprepar'd, Perchance e'en while you stretch the arm to grasp The bauble, for which years of toil, and crime, And suffering, have been wasted; when your heir By a short course of folly undermines The tottering column of your hard-earn'd fame, And sinks it in the dust from whence it rose. Happy is he, who 'cross yon sloping field Directs the labouring ploughshare, and inhales. The fragrance of the fresh-turn'd soil, till noon Relieves his weary team, and brings him back To th' antique hall, which in our grandsire's days Own'd loftier habitants, and has beheld Many a bold race of feudal lords expire 'Neath its fantastic roof; for there the board Spread by the frugal dame affords a feast More exquisite to him, whom healthy toil Invigorates, than regal banquets seem To the poor sickly minion of a court. O never may I in the tainted air Of crowded cities, where the din of trade And the loud clamours of corrupted mobs Assail my senses, be again immur'd! I seek these shades to hide my tortur'd head From an unjust, oppressive, hated world. The gloom of dark umbrageous boughs; the fresh And perfum'd odour that the loaded breeze Bears from the quivering leaves; the pathway cool, That takes with soft embrace my aching feet, Soothe my worn spirit, calm my trembling steps, And to existence rays of hope recall. I hear no shout of mobs; I hear no roll Of rattling cars, bedaub'd with new-got wealth, And deck'd with purchas'd blood-stain'd coronets, Thund'ring along the streets, and threat'ning loud To crush such poor and humble worms as I. I hear no more the coarse obstreperous din Of puff'd-up lawyers, venal, stupid, fierce, Blind to all merits but their own, and arm'd With all a pleader's subtle tricks to close The door, which thence has open'd to themselves. I hear no coxcomb Lord, who, having climb'd By the base arts a tool and minion loves, Babbles his finical and frothy stuff, And strives to legislate for all the world. Is none such to be found in the living Peerage? But wand'ring silent on, a gradual calm Spreads o'er my heart; âthere yet is peace for me,â I cry; and quick my buoyant spirit springs, And throws in scorn its load of cares away. Then Fancy rises from lethargic chains, Beneath whose weight long time oppress'd she lay; And as she lifts her hand, and waves her rod, Up the long vistas, on the opening lawns, I see gay Hope, with all her brilliant train, Weave the quick dance, and spread the splendid show. But, as the rays from her refulgent locks Glancing, invest the distant scenes in light, O let no more the falsely-glittering toys Of curst Ambition with delusive gleam Attract my sight; but be its choice some cot, Where in the gentle sunshine of Content Domestic privacy endears the day; Where Learning spreads her inexhausted tomes, And deep Reflection cheats the toil of time. O what are now to me the rancorous looks Of scornful Rivalry; the sordid tricks Of selfish Artifice; the glance oblique Of Slander, spitting, coward-like, its gall On the poor victim's undefended back? What is the sneer of bloated riches? What The ideot toss of Titles, which the spoils Of Fraud, Extortion, Rapine, have acquir'd? They agitate my heart no more; they cast A gloom no more upon my alter'd mien. Intent on other themes, that calm my soul, And elevate my thoughts, with dauntless eye I look on all the ills of life, and view Unmoved âthe ministers of human fate,â That still around me lurk.âO balmy breeze, That fann'st this bosom with thine odorous wings, Still blow, and let me bare it to thy breath. It beats not now with wild tumultuous throbs: But thrills with sweet serenity, while calm Hangs the cerulean canopy of Heaven, And Silence the soft light enchanted wooes. Now wakes the poet's strain; from yonder shades Methinks I hear the rapturous notes pour'd forth. O hail, ye gifted masters of the Lyre! If, long an alien to your holy rites, Lost I have wander'd, once again admit A sad repentant votary to your shrines! From you he seeks for genuine joy; from you He asks the charm that bids the gloomiest depths Of Solitude to smile, and peoples all The frowning wilderness with heavenly forms. O thou, from whose inspired lips arose The tale of âFairy castles, of brave Knights And gentle Ladiesâwhose immortal song Fierce wars, and faithful loves have moraliz'd,â O say, while haunting savage soils, See Spenser's Sonnets to Lord Ormond, and Lord Grey of Wilton. amid Barbaric clans, whose discord rude, and yells Of hideous tone, might e'en appal the hearts Of stoutest heroes, say, enchanting Bard, What but the Muse could soothe those anxious days Of never-ceasing perilâShe, who bade E'en Mulla's murmuring waters, as thou lay'st Calm on her banks, while Murder stalk'd around, Nurse thy sweet dreams, and cherish for thy lyre The brilliant scenes of visionary worlds! And thou, sublimest Milton, from whose tongue Flow'd holy inspiration, when beset With poverty, with sorrow, blame and scorn, âWith darkness and with dangers compass'd round,â What but the Muse, thy dreary rooms could light With glories of seraphic brilliancy? But where, O Nymph, dost thou delight to dwell? What are the scenes, that seem to foster most Thy day dreams? High-o'erarching bowers, the song Of birds, and lapse of rivers, and the sigh Of Zephyr in the leaves?âOn grassy banks The poet throws his careless limbs, while cool Beneath his feet the rippling current runs, And, as before his half-shut eyes appear Ten thousand glorious shapes, he weaves the lay, And feels unutterable joy, as grow The fairy forms of his creative brain. Thou, who could'st ope the fountains of the heart, At whose pathetic eloquence the eye Streams with big tears, and sobs the heaving breast, Unhappy Otway! as on Arun's marge Thine infant form was stretch'd, what airy imps Of pure angelic softness hover'd o'er Thy young imagination! What sweet notes Of inexpressive tenderness and joy With exquisite vibration thrill'd thine ear! O cruel was the fate, that led thy steps, From these the Muse's haunts, (where still she deigns To linger, and inspire her priestess, her, From whose enchanting lyre awake the tones, That touch the bosom and the fancy fill, Mrs. Charlotte Smith.) Led thy young steps to camps and courts impure, Where selfish Luxury and low-born Vice And sensual manners brutaliz'd the soul: Where mean degenerate thoughts beneath the pomp Of glittering vests debas'd the shape of man! Ah! ill-starr'd child of genius, could'st thou waste Thy voice inspir'd on groveling tribes like these? How did they press the fragance of thy mind, Pluck off its flowers, and rifle all its sweets To veil the poison of their fetid thoughts, Then âthrow thee like a nauseous weed away,â For very want in loathsome dens to die. âThomas Otway, son of Humphry Otway, rector of Wolbeding in Sussex, was born at Trottin in that county, March 3, 1651, sent to Winchester school, and thence to Oxford; but deserted the University 1674. He died at a spunging-house, known by the name of the Bull, on Tower-hill, on April 14, 1685, aged about thirty-five years.â From Oldys's MSS; who adds, that âin the collection of Familiar Letters of Lord Rochester, &amp;c. 1697, there are six of Otway, written to Mrs. Barry, the actress, in a very passionate and pathetical style, and much more eloquent than any other of his writings.âââOtway,â says Oldys, âwas more beholden to Captain Symonds, the vintner, in whose debt he died 400l. than to all his patrons of quality. See Les Soupirs de la Grand Bretagne, or the Groans of Great Britain, 8vo. 1713, p. 67.â Would, thou hadst never left thy native fields, But heard the woods, that whisper'd o'er thy birth, And streams that prattled to thine infant lips, Still to thy manhood murmur! Then perchance Some new Monimia with yet softer voice, Some Belvidera in pathetic tones Of tenderness e'en yet more exquisite, Had pierc'd our hearts and lifted up our souls! O form'd of texture too refin'd, of thought Too nice for worldly intercourse, no groves Had been too thick for thee; the chequer'd gloom Had sooth'd the coming phantoms of thy mind, And rang'd them in new visions, beautiful As tints of air-drawn castles! But the fiend Ambition cross'd thee; thy inspired voice Was chang'd to mortal; and an early grave Was the best gift thy hapless lot could gain! Mother of Virtue, Empress of the lyre, O lovely Solitude, with whom alone Sweet Sensibility is safe, to thee, Only to thee is my tumultuous heart Fit guest! Beneath thy peaceful wing subsides The wild confusion, which the shout of mobs, The din of company, the jest, the sneer, Envy's scance look, and Hatred's savage frown Upraise. With thee vanish the empty wish Of mean distinction, the degrading sigh For empty honours; each unholy thought, Ungenerous hopes, malignant prophecies, Resentment, Scorn, DisguiseâYet there are griefs, Not all the calm of silent woods, and streams Scarce murmuring, can ever soothe. Intent Upon the heart the blood-stain'd vultures fix, Gnawing with greedy appetite their prey!â How oft with eyes upon the ground I sit From hour to hour, while still th' incumbent weight Heavier and heavier grows! I wish for night, But thro' the night the cowering demons ply With maw insatiate, nor does th' opening dawn Bring ease! Exhausted, lifeless, I again Sink on my couch, and wish again for night. Blow all ye winds! Ye spirits of the storm, Direct the shrieking blast, at which the grove Shakes all its branches, and the forest groans! O let me mingle in the roaring war Of elements; and rouze this languid frame! Then may the fiends perchance, that torture me, Affrighted fly; and once again my lips Sound undisturb'd the gentle pastoral pipe! Echoes the shepherd's pipe o'er listening plains, And woods and vales his calm delight; he sighs Soft on his oaten stops, and on the breeze Floats the sweet sound along the silent air: It seems to speak serenity to me: The boiling of my breast subsides to peace; And vigorous ease returns. Philosophy Now opes her volumes to the ardent view; The heart and all its windings stand display'd To my inquiring gaze; the swelling bliss Of conscious Virtue; th' undisguised pang Of Vice, for transient pleasures bought too high; Sorrow's low murmur, Friendship's secret tear For cold Neglect; Affection's bursting cries For the lost object of her frantic love; Hypocrisy's deep-cover'd wish; the gall Working with venomous force in Envy's breast; All these, and yet a thousand more, with tints Changing, and various as the rainbow's hues, To Contemplation's eye distinct appear. Now History unfolds her pictur'd stores, And shews how vain are all the gay pursuits Of foolish Man; how empty is the toy The blood-stain'd Conqueror gains; what transient flowers Bloom in the thorny wreath the statesman wears! Here Honour climbs in vain; at every point Some ruffian guards the steep ascent, and shoves The struggler backwards, often to the pit Of dire destruction, whence he starts no more. Here Genius pines depress'd, while brazen tongues Usurp the chair of Wisdom; and Intrigue, And Falsehood, in triumphant splendor ride. He, who can look on such a scene as this, And sigh not for the calm of woodland shades, And innocent images, and fragrant airs Refreshing, and the song of birds, and moan Soothing, tho' mournful, of the lonely breeze, Has but a worldling's heart, that ne'er can beat With one high wish, aspiring Virtue claims. 'Mid all the beauties of this wondrous Orb, 'Tis the coarse spirit seeks life's busy paths; Noise, bustle, crowds, activity, turmoil. How rare is Virtue found with Power or State! Courts, senates, camps, scarce know her; and the road Ambition travels, is beset with crime! Where yonder ancient walls of flint uprear Their lofty roof, far seen for many a mile, St. John's in Swingfield, Kent, an ancient preceptory of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. On the main road from Canterbury to Dover, after passing the Half-Way-House, it is a conspicuous object on the right for some miles. See a very accurate print of this curious relic in Brayley's Beauties of England, (Kent). And yon old neighbouring park, Called Swingfield Park, now overgrown with wood. now thick o'ergrown With tangled copse-wood, spreads its wild domain O'er many a flat, and many a dell recluse, How often thro' the gloom of wintry clouds, Lost in its solitary shades I stray, Wrapt in the dreams of former days! I view The war-worn Knight, with spoils and trophies deck'd, Forth from the porch, whose antique spandrils still Malta's white cross adorns, forth issuing, mount The bounding courser, and with hounds and horn Dash thro' these coverts, while thro' each recess Rings the repeated echo of their cries. âO peace, O innocence, O lovely sports,â I hear him cry, âwhose healthful, chearing toil, Whose rapture âafter no repentance draws;â O never, never, may I know again The brawls of a tumultuous hateful world! Thro' the wide globe, across the raging main, O'er earth's most savage haunts; the battle's rage, Th' Assassin's den, the Enchanter's mad'ning spells, I've sought the phantom Fame, as one who held The key, that op'd the door to Happiness. But yet, e'en when the Syren led to halls Of feast and merriment; the song, the dance, The gorgeous show; the crowd of belted chiefs, Heroes, and beauteous dames; I never knew Joys so serene as these so cheaply bought! O madness to go far, and seek so wide Thro' danger, and thro' guilt, for that small pearl, Which at so little cost is found at home! When evening shades descend, with mind at ease, And limbs just fitted to repose, I seek The venerable dome, and as the fire Casts its bright blaze across the war-clad hall, I enter, and, to temperate feast attun'd, Enjoy the luxury of rest, and feel Night's stillness creeping on, till sighing blasts, Just murmuring, sink my frame to slumbers deep. E'en the sweet dream of perils past no more Flits cross my brain: but in profound repose I lie, and, waking with the morning's beam, Rise calm and vigorous to my pure delights; And thus I ask the remnant of my life To wear away; then near yon humble fane Beneath a turf-clad grave to sleep in peace!â CÃ¦tera desunt. ELEGIAC LINES, ON MRS. LEFROY, WHO DIED BY A FALL FROM HER HORSE, DEC. 16,1804. The following character of her appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. lxxiv. p. 1178. âTo do justice to the character of Mrs. Lefroy would require a command of glowing and pathetic expression far beyond the powers of the writer of this article. She was alike the delight of the old and the young, of the lively and the severe, the rich and the poor. She received from Nature an intellectual capacity of the highest order; her perceptions were rapid; her memory was tenacious; her comprehension was extensive; her fancy was splendid; her sentiments were full of tenderness; and her language was easy, copious, and energetic. It may be truly said of her, that âShe lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.â âAt twelve years old she wrote a beautiful Hymn, and other small poems; and two or three of her compositions, written nearly thirty years ago, are inserted in the first volume of the Poetical Register, p. 32, 36, 112. These poems are easy, elegant, and full of those natural graces which form a charming contrast to that laboured and turgid style so lately fashionable. Yet they convey a very faint idea of the powers, which, had she bestowed a little more effort and frequency on such occupations, she could have exhibited. But possessed of various qualities to please, and capable of delighting by more general and social attraction, she never aspired to the fame of an author. It was only an accidental impulse that occasionally prompted her to seize the pen; when she wrote, for private amusement, a few glowing and unaffected lines, with the same forcible and careless rapidity, with which she talked: in these, however, a sagacious reader will see what a more constant and regulated attention to this art could have enabled her to perform. It was by the tenor of her amiable and virtuous life, by her lively and enchanting manners, by the overflowing benevolence of her disposition, by clothing the naked, by feeding the hungry, by instructing the ignorant, by healing the sick, and by comforting the mourner, that she has won a more noble wreath of fame, and drawn over her grave the lasting tears of her agonized friends and numerous acquaintance, and the heartbroken lamentations and earnest prayers of the poor! Actuated by the warmth of her natural sensibility, and inspired by the elevated dictates of a religion, which predominated over her whole mind, she suffered neither the allurements of society, to which no one was so sensible, nor the attachments of blood and friendship, which no one ever felt more exquisitely, to seduce her from those more humble duties, which she exercised in unwearied endeavours to ameliorate the condition of poverty and wretchedness. Whoever frequented her house, at which hospitality and benignity constantly reigned, has seen her at her daily task of teaching the village children to read, to write, to work, to make baskets of straw; has seen her administer medicines to the sick, and consolation to the afflicted; and has seen the numerous resort from a wide-surrounding neighbourhood, of whom she communicated the important benefits of vaccine innoculation to upwards of 800 with her own hand. Of such a character, so suddenly taken away, when neither age nor illness had yet arrived to impair her mind or constitution, even they who knew her not, cannot blame this long memorial: for where is such an union of admirable qualities to be found? In intellect, in heart, in temper, in manners, in strict and elevated principles, in pure and untainted conduct, she has left no second behind her.â WRITTEN IN DEC. 1806. Deep grief is dumb; else long ago, dear shade, To thee the mournful Muse her rites had paid: Whelm'd with the stroke, e'en now my palsied brain Struggles with feeble effort at the strain: The fountain of my former tears is dry; And wan Despair sits fix'd in either eye. Ah! Time, that boasts to mellow down the hues Of wild Regret, and o'er her form diffuse A soothing sadness, teaches me to know With keener certainty my darkening woe! At every care, and every rising joy, Each task, that would my wand'ring thoughts employ, The morning ramble, and the evening toil, Thro' life I look'd for thy consoling smile! But now, whene'er I Learning's page unroll, And strive by studious pains to raise my soul, Soon as in vain I seek thy cheering look, Down from my' unclasping hands descends the book! Forgetful of my loss, if transient fire Impels those hands to seize the silent lyre, To thee I bid it pour its trembling tone!â Thou hearest not!âit breathes a dying moan; And instantly the rising spirit's flown! Sometimes I wake from some enchanting dream Bright with the Muses' rainbow-tinctured beam, Or deck'd with golden pomp, and all the show That bold Ambition's gorgeous flames bestow; Glowing, I haste, my raptures to impart; But thou, alas! art gone; and to my heart Cold chilling damps of hopeless anguish dart. Loveliest of human beings, Sister, Friend, Instructor, Guardian, where can ever end The praise, that to thy angel worth belongs; Worth that has e'en transcended poets' songs! In every walk of life, beloved, ador'd, How have all ranks thy hapless fate deplor'd! How did thy liberal hand, and melting voice, Bid the chill'd heart of Poverty rejoice! Amid the circles of the rich and wise, How spoke the mental radiance of thine eyes! How charm'd the wisdom of thy flowing tongue! How from thy breast the lore of angels sprung! But while thy mortal relics slumber here, Moisten'd by Love's, by Friendship's, Virtue's tear, Thy blissful spirit, O exalted Saint, Which not the mixture of earth's mould could taint, Wanders triumphant; and the swelling lyre, Touch'd by thy human hands with hallow'd fire, Around the throne, where singing Seraphs blaze, Strikes in glad notes to thy Creator's praise!</field>
