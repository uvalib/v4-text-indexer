      <field name="fulltext">PART I FOREST NOTES TO THE FOREST O Forest, dim mysterious rustling Forest, The shelter of uncounted generations; Where Life and Death war ever, each triumphant; The sun above, and underneath the twilight; Wherein is wrought the alchemy of seasons, The dream, the song, the cruelty of Nature: Where be the unremembered generations That once were men, with pulses strong, triumphant, But now are ghosts, conceived but in the twilight, Who trod these woods, each for its few short seasons, Singing its hymn to God or Gods of Nature, And dropping like the leaves that strew the forest? Lo, here Art never came, to stand triumphant, To tell us of dead nations lost in twilight, And teach their ended story of a season; But in its wild monotonous life of Nature, Like Ocean the unchangeable, the forest Outlives, forgets, and hides the generations. I love to watch thee in the leafy twilight, Working in silent patience at the Seasons, With unseen unheard forces, old in Nature; Or hear the living harp, O lyric Forest, With which thou hast enchanted generations, In tones now weird, now joyous and triumphant. The Winds sweep by, blind Servants of the Seasons, Caressing all the lightest things in Natureâ The heathers, ferns and hare-bells of the forestâ Felling the oak, the pride of generations, The Monarch that defied the years, triumphant, And sheltered its dumb children in the twilight. Oh there is nothing in eternal Nature, Save Ocean, half so thrilling as the forest, So full of charm to fleeting generations; Outliving life, outliving death, triumphant; Ineffable in sunshine and in twilight, Inscrutable in all its wondrous seasons. ENVOY So fill the forest, dreams of generations; Come, Mystery triumphant, born of twilight, And Pleasure that Pain seasons through all Nature. E. GREENWOOD MUSIC O charmÃ¨d song that every greenwood sings, Sings low, sings high, sings ever faint yet strong; Thy mystic echo through the forest rings, O charmÃ¨d song. What threads the strain the stars hymn all night long? What undernote is heard from golden strings? Longing and loving, agony and wrong; The ravished nests, the robin's broken wings; Defeated years that through the green aisles throng; The tear that at thy poignant music springs, O charmÃ¨d song. A. LOVERS IN THE WOODS To summer Woods, alembics of hot scent, We wend by moss and bracken, where the floods Of sun-light filter through a leafy tent; To summer Woods. The wood-dove's coo goes forth from where she broods; The insect hum drones ever on unspent; The shadows alter with the long day's moods. And all the elves that play at night have bent, From where they lurk beneath their mushroom hoods, Wee roguish eyes on us, whom Love has sent To summer Woods. E. A HUSH There is a listening silence where we are; Not calm of sleep, nor swoon of noonday heat; But stillness like to that ere song of bird, Or like to sharp pulsations of a star Piercing night's silence though no sound be heard; Or like to thrill of lovers' hands that meet. A. SOUS LES TOITS DE VERDURE Beneath the beechen bough Come now, come now, O love of happy days, That we may sit in shadows And watch the unmown meadows Far from the bitter ways. The breath of Summer passes Across the seeded grasses To whisper to the trees; The boughs of Summer, bending, Give out a sigh unending Of pleasure to the breeze. Here tears mean dew, not sorrow; Here there is no to-morrow, No murmur but of bees. The past, to-day, is far away, And sighs are sighs of ease. E. UNDERNOTES We lingered, strolling in the summer's prime, Under the beech-roof of the greenwood lane; And listened to the lute-strings of the rain Thrummed to the mournful measures of old time. âNature is grave,â he said; âher harp sublime Is tuned to keynotes of remembered pain; The summer woods are sweet, but yet the strain Of unforgotten winters threads the chime.â âSweetheart,â I said, âher moods are manifold, And sad and bright and weird and bitter-sweet. Her angel trump is all of sunset gold; Her cythera with morning-rays is strung; Her voice is jocund with the noonday heat, And every silence is a song unsung.â A. SONG Under the Winter, dear, Summer's note lieth: If it be sweet to hear Song never dieth. Soon in the forest, love, Breezes shall bear it; There, in the bough above, Lo, thou shalt hear it. E. THE WOODS AT NOON Sweet are the woods, where unseen blackbirds flute, And sun-beams fleck the hollow chill and mute Where the pool broods; Where charmÃ¨d doves old lullabies still croon, While silence lies within the arms of noon; Sweet are the woods. The summer's joy enwreathes the brow of day: The quivering rays about his tresses lay Their fingers coy; And each hoar trunk breaks forth in jocund leaves, For now the Sun is at his loom and weaves The summer's joy. A. ON TWO INTERWELDED TREES I saw an oak and beech so intergrown That root and trunk were one, and rind to rind Was soldered; while their branches in the wind Enclasped each other, each the other's own: As if, of old, a wood-nymph and a faun Had, in their wild embrace been stricken blind By some strong god;âtheir living limbs confined In knotty bonds, while round each other thrown. O Love, I think that when we two are dead, Buried together in some wood like this, Where giant boughs shall wail us in the breeze, Some oak and beech shall o'er us interwed, Welding their limbs in an unending kiss, That we may love, O Sweetheart, still as trees. E. SUMMER'S LIFE When buds are green, and June is won, The Summer's life is just begun; Her dimpling fingers press at will The swelling breasts of mead and hill. When flash the scythes, and grass is mown The Summer comes into her own, And roams the meadows free of care; A maid with poppies in her hair. When every copse for song is made The Summer queens it through the glade, With sceptre of the bulrush green, And radiant challenge in her mien. When reapers sing and stooks arise, The Summer in the cornfield lies, And yields her body up to Death Crowned with the Autumn's reddening wreath. A. OLD FOREST CHARMS Upon her nest of twigs the wood-dove broods; The cooing note rolls softly through young green; A woodpecker is tapping on unseen; The hum of insects fills the heated woods. The cooing note rolls softly through young green; The sun-discs dance where golden light intrudes; The hum of insects fills the heated woods As on the beech-tree's knotty roots we lean. The sun-discs dance where golden light intrudes; The moss weaves carpets for the Elfin Queen; As on the beech-tree's knotty roots we lean, We con the forest's old eternal moods. The moss weaves carpets for the Elfin Queen, When tiny heads shall peep from fairy hoods; We con the forest's old eternal moodsâ Old things that are, that shall be, that have been. E. SUMMER SHADOWS We spoke of winter through the summer noon; Of widowed boughs, the robin's lonely tune, The silence of the wan December moon; âOn every tree,â I sighed, âDeath brands his name.â âTrue, child,â he said; âthe green leaves die too soon, We bind the faggots while the wood-doves croon, But out of them shall rise a song of flame.â And, wistful, in the wood with dead twigs strewn, We spoke of winter through the summer noon. A. DURABILITY How many loves have met and passed away Beneath these silent sempiternal trees, None knows or ever will: we can but say, âWe too are loving 'neath the boughs today; We too are kissing in the summer breeze Beneath these silent sempiternal trees Where many loves have met and passed away.â Why naught is made for durability Ask of the grasses waiting for the scythe, Ask of the leaves that pause on Autumn's tree. We know but this: Fate lets some moments be When Time stands still, and souls may cease to writhe; Nor ask the grasses waiting for the scythe Why naught is made for durability. The shadow of the great clouds sweeps the sward; The wave of ears runs swift along the corn; The breeze's kiss is hurrying o'er the ford. All's change and motion, and the forest chord Only vibrates to die as soon as born. The wave of ears returns not through the corn, Nor shadow of the clouds across the sward. Beside the shadowy margin of the wood Oh, let us sit, and dream that all endures; That love and nature know no widowhood. Here love would kiss for ever if it could: So for one minute, loveâmy hand in yoursâ Oh, let us sit, and dream that all endures, Beside the shadowy margin of the wood. E. UNKNOWN SONGSTERS The song-bird drops; the bird-song never dies. The black frost strikes; the throstles's wee heart stops; But Spring brings back the song, and none surmise The song-bird drops. Songsters there be, who never reach the tops Of Fame's high boughs, but whose low melodies Blend with the deeper shadows of the copse. They die; yet song endures: we hear it rise From other unknown throats. Death reaps his crops, But new notes wake, although without a prize The song-bird drops. E. FOREST-MASS Now Daylight seeks a shrine of sleep: A young moon floats on silver wings; The night-choir of the forest sings; The nightingales their vigil keep. A young moon floats on silver wings; Small dew-fonts now are filling deep; The nightingales their vigil keep, Where high the woodbine's censer swings. Small dew-fonts now are filling deep; The little hare-bell faintly rings; Where high the woodbine's censer swings About Night's altar white mists creep. The little hare-bell faintly rings; Moon-shadows through the forest sweep; About Night's altar white mists creep; Night celebrates her holy things. A. THE PASSING WING Oh would that Time were one immense To-day, That we might sit for ever where boughs sing, Amid these ripe hot ferns that light winds sway, Safe from the Morrow's and the Past's dark thing: Oh would that Love could make the wood-dream stay, And stop Time's broad inexorable wing! But no: Time's broad inexorable wing Sweeps on for all: thou shalt not bid it stay. What brings thee woe, brings others life's sweet thing, Sweeps pain and fear, with joy and hope, away: Love may not cry, while high boughs round it sing, âOh would that Time were one immense Today!â E. VOICES We lie amid the green waves of the grass, Lapped in the radiance of love's sunny dream, Nor hear the distant murmur of the wood, Echoes that through the forest branches moan, Beyond these placid billows where the heart Drifts on the grasses in the summer sun. What reck we of the tempest, we who dream And laugh beyond the voices of the wood, Deaf to the sadness of the fitful moan? Life gives an hour for joy to every heart; One hour to feel the breezes, know the sun, And watch the ripples rippling on the grass. The grass-waves lap the margin of the wood; We listen wistful to the branches' moan That echoes from the forest's hollow heart, And menaces the gladness of the sun; It calls us from the sunny waves of grass Into the shadow of a darker dream. The deepened voice of that compelling moan Wakens the yearning of each human heart Rejoicing in the gladness of the sun; Tossed on the living ripple of the grass: âLove, must we wake from love's triumphant dream To heed the solemn moaning of the wood,â âThough love endureth in the lover's heart? Though it is good to see the summer sun? Though July breathes across the blades of grass And lifts their green waves, like a tide a-dream, Up to the margin of the shadowy wood Where the great caverns of the branches moan?â No answer cometh from the joyous sun, Nor any voice from sunlit seas of grass, Nor any surety that love dreams no dream. The grave, unsilenced voices of the wood Pitched to eternity shall ever moan Their troubled menace to the troubled heart. ENVOY Though flesh be grass, love but a changeful dream, And in the wood Death makes his warning moan, Be glad, oh heart! life lives in earth and sun. A. WOOD HONEY In the woods in summer weather There is honey for the bee; In the woods we haunt together There is honey too for me. But the bee's is in the heather, And I gather mine in thee. E. CUPID IN THE WOODS In the woods we went a-straying Through the summer's golden hours; Cupid too was there a-playing, Gathering hearts as we the flowersâ While we lingered, sweet delaying, Lo! he saw and gathered ours. Startled by this loss appalling, When the hearts we first did miss, âCupid, Cupid,â we went calling, âHast thou had to do with this?â Then, his answer swift forestalling, Lo! we found them in a kiss! A. SUMMER MURMURS Breeze that art coming Over the sea, Bee that art humming Over the lea, What do ye murmur, murmur to me? âRipe are the grasses Summer's wing passes; Warm is the sun; Yet, oh remember Frost and December, Leaves that are fallen, leaves that are dun.â E. RIPENING HOLLY All round us there is holly; and the light Makes its leaves glitter with metallic sheen Hard, prickly, bright. The clustered berries, small as yet and green, Are ripening slowly for the Christmas days, And scarcely seen. Ay, ripen, holly, in the August rays: The mistletoe, thy partner, ripens fast On distant ways; The children in a thousand homes will cast Their wistful eyes upon thee: grow for them, Who have no Past. For, many a Christmas guest whom cares condemn To sit apart, and scan with eyes that brood Thy prickly stem, Sees in thy crimson berries drops of blood, And in the mistletoe's the frozen tears Of life's lost good. But oh the children know no bygone years, No grief to come: so, holly, grow apace Till Christmas nears. And they shall crowd about the high wreath'd base Of each betinselled dazzling Christmas fir, With wondering face, While resinous scents from bough and taper stir Awed visions round that pyramid of light Like holiest myrrh. The quivering wreath of flame, pale-blue and bright, Shall round the pride of Christmas flicker up On Christmas night; And still the carol sound, the wassail cup Be filled, and with his holly diadem King Christmas sup; So, holly, ripen on thy prickly stem And fill thy clusters which the dews now wet, With glowing crimson on the forest's hem: We need thee yet. E. NOON'S DREAM-SONG The day is long; the worn Noon dreams. He shifts in vain, to ease his pain, And, through what seems, he hears a song: A forest song, whose high note seems To tell of pain, endured in vain, And fills his dreams with things lost long. A dead love seems to thrill that song; Hope nursed in vain, years passed in pain, Leaves fallen long, a tide that dreams. Then, as he dreams, the shades grow long; And, in his pain, he moans in vain While fades the song of what but seems. E. SPRING IN AUTUMN The ghost of Spring is in this Autumn haze; The scent of bloom beneath green orchard trees; The sound of bleating lambs in grassy ways, Of nesting birds, of songs in yellow leas. I find its fragrance in this storÃ¨d hay That knows the secret of the July breeze, And holds the music of the roundelay, The creaking crickets sang, and humming bees. The reapers' joy recalls the lark's shrill praise; His song rose here where now the sickles sing; And where the weighted ear to harvest sways He poised, before he spread his skyward wing. The noon of Autumn keeps the wistful gleam Of April sun, and rain-besprinkled rays; And the pale wings of falling petals seem To dim the sunshine of September days. A. THE SQUIRREL Among the English oaks, where great boughs spread, My wee friend wore a coat of foxy red, And with his brush held high, from overhead He watched us, peeping. In Kansas Woods, a year ago to-day, His little coat was unfamiliar grey, And like a silver flash he crossed the way Up maple leaping. And here amid these dark Bavarian firs His coat is black; a mourning garb he wears; Munching a fir-cone, from the boughs he peers, While noon is creeping E. LOVE IN THE WOODS Green moss, green fern, green sheen on beetle wings In forest ways; And in my heart young love that newly springs Through summer days. Sweet love that over summer's heated rays Its incense flings; To mingle with the pinewood's scented haze And all sweet things; Freed love that fearless threads the sun's hot maze On sapphire wings; Bright love that glows more bright when day delays And curfew rings;â Glad love, a fledgeling that its first song sings Through noonday blaze; Sweetheart, such love is here where star-moss springs In forest ways. A. WOOD SONG When we are gone, love, Gone as the breeze, Woods will be sweet, love, Even as these. Sunflecks will dance, love, Even as now, Here on the moss, love, Under the bough. Others unborn, love, Maybe will sit Here in the wood, love, Leafily lit; Hearking as now, love, Treble of birds; Breathing as we, love, Wondering words. Others will sigh, love, Even as we: âOnly a day, love, Murmurs the bee.â E. THE RAINBOW Between the rain and the rain Hope flashed, a gleam in the sky; And the wistful world was fain Of the wonder passing by, And the setting sun was fain Of the radiance soaring high; He twined him a flowery chain, And over the sea and the plain, Set Hope, a bow in the sky. A. THE FOREST'S SOUL My soul has mingled with the Forest's soul; Danced with its lights and shadows; laughed its laugh; Caught every lightest whisper as it stole; Drunk in each wood-bell what its fairies quaff; Thrilled with its every rustle overhead; Thrilled with its every rustle underfoot; Breathed breath of bracken; heard what each tree said To sun and wind and dew, and what each root Said to the Earth, the dark eternal Mother; What squirrel, mouse and hedgehog told each other Of never-ending Summer; what the mole Whispered to tree-root gnomes, deep in his hole; Yea, heard the tale the robin and the wren, The thrush, the blackbird, told his tiny hen: Oh! I have listened to the warning wail Of groping winds, precursors of the gale, Between the shuddering oak-trees that well know The battle-song of Tempest, and the roll Of forest thunder, distant still and low: My soul has mingled with the Forest's soul. E. SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS Where sun-rays slant among green-tufted firs The old dead forests moulder mound on mound; Deaf to the music that the summer stirs, Blind to the fluttering banners of the sky. Death's antique mystery enwraps them round Where underneath the newer roots they lie, The older generations of the ground. Where flickering shade the noon's gay sunlight blurs, Still ranks of fir-trees rise by death unbound, And breathe out breath as sweet as eastern myrrhs. Their linkÃ¨d lives the centuries defy; Their heads the raindrop and the star have crowned, Though underneath their newer roots now lie The older generations of the ground. A. AMONG THE FIRS And what a charm is in the rich hot scent Of old fir forests heated by the sun, Where drops of resin down the rough bark run And needle litter breathes its wonderment. The old fir forests heated by the sun, Their thought shall linger like the lingering scent, Their beauty haunt us, and a wonderment Of moss, of fern, of cones, of rills that run. The needle litter breathes a wonderment; The crimson crans are sparkling in the sun From tree to tree the scampering squirrels run; The hum of insects blends with heat and scent. The drops of resin down the rough bark run: And riper, ever riper, grows the scent: But eve has come, to end the wonderment And slowly up the tree trunk climbs the sun. E. THE CHARGE OF THE WINGED STEEDS The firs are ranged in endless dark battalions On mountain-side and valley, line on line, Waiting the Winds, that on their viewless stallions Are bearing down, at Winter's sudden sign. The mighty trees are grappling to the rock With every root, preparing for the shock Of that wild cavalry, and seem to hearken Silent and sturdy, as the grey clouds darken, For the first howl of war. From far away Its echo comes; and like a moaning wave It thrills each giant fir. The great boughs sway And shower down dead needles. Dark and grave The fir trunks wait. And, lo, a stronger sound, A roar and rattle, shakes the very ground, Louder and louder yet, from North to South, And makes the forest shudder. Winter's mouth Blows its great battle peal. And now they come The shadowy squadrons, howling their wild song Of death and devastation, from their home In the dark North: and as they whirl along Urging their tameless steeds with icy whip The fir stems bend beneath them. Clench your grip, Ye desperate roots! Again and yet again The Winds renew the charge and break in vain Against the serried trunks that creak and groan Indomitably firm, and hold their own Beneath a million scimitars. The roar Shrills to a lyric horror. When the last Of the winged stallions of the North has passed, And all is dumb and motionless once more, The Forest's face has altered: all that told Of Summer's joy and Autumn's lingering sway Has vanished in a moment, swept away By Winter's ghostly steeds; and all is cold, And colourless and bare, and nature old.

      <field name="fulltext">PART II OTHER POEMS A GOLDEN DROP You ask me for a drop of golden wine: Perchance from Lethe grapes in Circe's cup? Or Samian that Anacreon held up In his last toast, all crowned with rose and pine? Or is it from KhayyÃ¢m's great dreamy vine? Or poison trickle from a Borgian sup? Or that last joyous and untasted drop Which Thule's King flung sorrowing in the brine? There is a chalice all of chasÃ¨d gold Wherein the Poet's magic wine drops stand, Pressed from the grapes of Heaven one by one: A sacramental chalice which of old Some sonnet-goldsmith wrought with cunning hand: Each drop is topaz flashing in the Sun. E. A ROMAN LAKE We stood by Nemi's lake, where, seen by none, Tiberius' galley lies, half changed to coal, Hid in deep fathoms, while the ages roll Over the waters slowly, one by one. We stood there by the lake and watched the sun Pour purple like red wine into a bowl, Until the hills grew wan, as when the soul Parts from the body and its day is done. Oh, who can tell what lieth deep below The Future's surface, whether grey and cold, Or flushed with purple, like the even's glow? We can but drink to hope scarce one day old, In such red wine as Hesperus pours now From his eternal amphora of gold. E. IN HADRIAN'S VILLA I I stand amid a world of shattered walls In the great shadow of eternal Wings, Where human lives, and man's fast-fleeting things Shrink into insect size and Time appals. And in these rock-like tesselated halls Where wild birds sing 'mid ilex murmurings, While dance the sun-flecks that some stone-pine flings, I pick the violets that the young spring calls. The tiny cubes of white mosaic strew The ground like dice, which unremembered Years On Death's forgotten board for empire threw; And all around, the hills, in dreamy tiers Stand as when Hadrian watched them, faint and blue And reck not of man's useless hopes and fears. E. IN HADRIAN'S VILLA II The fane is ruined and its gods have fled; Through court and grove now strays the lonely breeze,â Spring's wayward child that never knoweth ease,â Flinging shrill questionings to quick and dead. Nor answer comes; but where his feet have sped Burgeon the ilex and the olive trees; And some Apollo on his shattered knees Hears the young violet pierce his ivy bed. Man's soul in vast and lonely halls doth rove; His years have known of bitterness their sum, He asks his gods of Faith and Hope and Love, âWhere do I go? and whence is it I come?â Life writes its yearly message in the grove, But every empty oracle is dumb. A. AT VENICE So now she stands by Glory's great sea-grave And has the first fair vision of that shrine Where it lies sainted with its smile divine, Rubied in sunset, em'ralded in wave; Where the stones whisper of the masques they gave Of argosy and pageant, line on line; Till we are drunk with splendour as with wine In that broad street which molten beryls pave. I wonder if she thinks of me at whiles, Or only of the dim Byzantine gold And time-stained fronts, and seaweed-covered piles? And if a corner of her heart doth hold Something besides a dream of the crowned isles That ruled the sunrise and its waves of old? E. ON A RENAISSANCE MANTELPIECE A beetling mantelpiece of carven stone With doves and cupids and the tendrilled vine Sculptured of old; where mighty logs of pine Yield ruddy flames, while outer tempests moan; An ample hearth, where, in the days long gone Warrior and bard and dame of royal line Drank the mulled ale or poured the scalded wine And told old saws of forests wild and lone. O sweet, I crave such shelter from the storm, Such cheering warmth, such comfortable cup Beneath the ample mantel of thy love. There would I sit, where all is bright and warm And watch the dancing flame, which, leaping up, Will glow on the carved tendril and the dove. E. ROTHENBURG I A dream of gables and of olden days; Of dragon-crested fountains, knights on tombs; Of leaded panes, huge beakers, dungeon glooms; Of banners, Gothic signboards, low-arched ways; Of guilds, of 'prentices, of city frays; Of patient armourers in raftered rooms; Of weavers bending over household looms; Of particoloured knaves; of mystery plays. Ay, ay, a dream: and in the city square A spectre soldiery, and phantom men, Women, and children, kneeling as in prayer Before a phantom Tilly, sitting there On ghostly steed. ... And see, as even then Dark doom is in his eyes; in theirs despair. E. ROTHENBERG II The old town dreams at noon; each empty sill Stares blankly like the eyeballs of the dead. Grey wall and gable, roof of faded red, Rampart and tower the silent distance fill. St. George upon the fountain charges still; The water splashes in its sculptured bed; But hum of guild is hushed, the 'prentice fled, Vanished the weaver's art, the carver's skill. The Rath-haus dial lengthens with the day; Across the sunset comes a sound of song; The street wakes to the footfall of a throng Of little maids green-garlanded and gay; And all the old years, and the dead, dead long, Troop back to life, and join the children's play. A. LO, WHAT IS LOVE? Lo, what is love? A dreamer in a sleep, Who dreaming sees, though waking still is blind; He sees the yellow sheaves the reapers bind; He hears the song that rises as they reap. Lo, what is love? A toiler on a steep, Who upward strains where lonely pathways wind To reach the summit never foot may find, To catch the song no mortal ear may keep. Lo, what is love? A shell upon the sands Whose tenants are the echo and the breeze; But he who takes it, listening, in his hands Shall hear the murmur of eternal seas; The voice of stars that sing o'er harvest lands, The music vast of human mysteries. A. QUEEN O' THE YEAR Comes in her splendour The year's fairest comer; Make way before her! GreetingâO Summer! There, where the starlight Throws shadows of amber, Her bright yellow cohorts Of crocuses clamber. Where the moon shivers The gloom of the river, The silvery circles Of lily-lamps quiver. Where the thrush whistles His praise of her power, Laburnums have lighted, The bough is a-flower. Where the red dawn-glow Under the rays is, The hills and the hollows Are bright with the daisies. Where aspen branches Blue skies are rifting, Over the bars of grass Blue-bells are drifting. Day's happy children Surround her with dances; Smiling and curtseying, Summer advances. A. TO AN OLD GARDEN Old-fashioned Garden where bloom for the bee Sober sweet flowers, For our whisperings give her and me One of thy hours. Here, where hath blossomed so many a kiss Old and forgotten, Give us a seat for the latest that this Year hath begotten. Here, in thy paths that are tidy and quaint, Presences linger Like the songs written in ink that is faint Once, by dead finger. Hollyhocks purple and marigolds red, You will be living, When, like the others, we two shall be dead, No kisses giving. Therefore forgive us the rapture and thrill, Garden that lastest, While overhead fly the pinions that chill, Silently, fastest. Give us the breath of thy sweetness and charm Only an hour; Ah, could I hold her with sheltering arm Out of Time's power! E. SCHLÃSSEL-BLUME Key-flower. Oh, Love, your fingers hold The golden key of the spring; The meadows are dusted gold, The lark is high on the wing, And his song bright notes doth fling Like living stars on the wold: Oh Love, your fingers hold The golden key of the spring. But the day is wintry cold, And the lark no more can sing; The meadows in mist are stoled, Your heart is locked to its King. Oh, Love, your fingers hold The golden key of the Spring. A. NEW LIFE Alas for the heart where no love may spring! (Oh, the wind blows keen from the north!) For the empty nest and the broken wing. (Oh, the breath of the frost goes forth!) For the bird that nevermore song shall sing, And the desolate days of earth. Under the snowdrifts the blossoms awake; (Oh, the wind comes up from the east!) And forth from the prison of winter break, For the voice of the storm hath ceased. Arouse thee, my heart, and love's new life take, As winds take the perfumes, and feast. A. SHADOWS The future years are in the glad To-day As summer glooms are in the spring's young green, As manhood hides within the child unseen; The solemn portents lurk in hours of play. As summer glooms are in the spring's young green, In folds of mirth dark thoughts are hid away; The solemn portents lurk in hours of play, Though joy beguile us with irradiant mien. In folds of mirth dark thoughts are hid away. Oh fools, that on To-day's assurance lean! Though joy beguile us with irradiant mien, The shadows lengthen on the sunlit way. Oh fools, that on To-day's assurance lean! Dust claims its dust, strive how the spirit may; The shadows lengthen on the sunlit way; We are but what dead dust has long while been. A. LOVE-LIES-A-BLEEDING In the old garden-path Sorely care needing, Fadeth a plant away: âLove-lies-a-bleeding.â In the old manor-house, Listless, scarce heeding, Fadeth a life away; âLove-lies-a-bleeding.â E. WILD-ROSE HEDGES Down the lane the lady comes, Between the wild-rose fences; In the field Sir Ronald hums A song of love's pretences. In the lane the lady stays, Hearkening to the singing; In the field the knight delays To pluck the blossom springing. Fast the leafy pulses beat For the blinded mortals Passing with unheeding feet Love's wide-open portals. Living hedges thus divide Lovers made for mating; Thorn and blossom still must hide Hearts each other waiting. Knight and lady did not meet, Forth together faring; Hers a song of bitter-sweet, His a flower for wearing. A. LITTLE LOVE-SONG I love you as the bee that sips The flower's lipsâ I love you as the summer grasses Adore the sighing breeze that passes Their waving tipsâ I love you as the streams the Sun That makes them sparkle as they run, And turns the pebbles that they hold To lumps of gold; And every day That you're away Is dull and weary, sad and cold. E. LOVE, THE REAPER Where the keen scythes pass Through the seeded grass, And the lark's nest lurks in green; When the hay is spread For the summer's bed, Love the reaper reaps unseen. Where sickles flash white Through the long daylight, And the bending gleaners glean; When a fledgeling brood Seeks the sheltering wood, Love the reaper reaps unseen. When the crescent slight Reaps the skies at night, And the star sheaves clustered lean; Where the silence flings Its silvery wings, Love the reaper reaps unseen. A. FULFILMENT Lo! we reach the results of life With a hush of heart and brain That is mute regret for the strife We shall never know again. Although we may conquering rise, We shall look with yearning sweet, And a smart in the sun-dimmed eyes, To the years when we knew defeat; And the crown of the life's success We shall wear with yearning vain For the years of our loneliness, And the joy we then called pain. A. LIFE For Life is a song and a silence, A rapture of mounting wings; The scent and the tint of the sunrise, The light that the dewdrop flings; The pause and the leap of the fountain, The span of the rainbow's rings; The dream, and the sleep that is dreamless, The blossom of countless springs. For life is a cry and a waking, The touch of a hand unknown; A bough that is shaken by tempest, A harvest by aliens sown. 'Tis a bird whose wings have been broken, A wind that waileth alone, A Vision, a Fear, and a Wonder; A name on a crumbling stone. But if Life hold vision of sunrise, Or portents of night that appal; If it moan with the moan of the storm-wind, Or echo bird voices that call;â Yet its song that is sung is sweeter For tears that in silence fall, And the anguish of Life is nobler Than Death that has frozen all.
