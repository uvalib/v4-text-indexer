[My true loue hath my hart, and I haue his] My true loue hath my hart, and I haue his, By iust exchange one for the other giuen, I hold his deare, and mine he cannot misse, There neuer was a better bargaine driuen. His hart in me keepes me and him in one, My hart in him his thoughts and senses guides, He loues my hart, for once it was his owne, I cherish his, I because in me it bides, in because bides. [II. His hart his wound receiued from my sight] His hart his wound receiued from my sight His hart his wound receiued from my sight, his wound, his wound, receiued from my sight, from my sight, My hart was wounded, with his wounded hart, with his wounded hart, For as from me, on him, on him his hart light, So still me thought in mee his hart did smart, So still me thought in me his hart did smart, his hart did smart, Both equall hurt in this, Change sought our blisse: My true loue hath my hart, and I, and I haue his. Both equall hurt in this, Change fought our blisse: My true loue hath my hart, and I, and I haue his. [III. O say deere life] O say deere life O say deere life, when shall these twineborne berryes, So louely ripe, by my rude lips, rude lips be tasted? Shall I not plucke, Shall I not pluck? (Sweet fay not nay) Shall I not pluck those Cherryes? O let them not with Sommers heate be blasted, be blasted, Nature thou know'st bestow'd them free on thee, Then be thou kinde, bestow them free on me, on me, on me, bestow them free on me. IIII. [In health and ease am I] In health and ease am I, Yet, as I senslesse were it nought contents me, You sicke, you sicke in paine doe lye, And (ah) your payne exceedingly torments me, Whereof I can this onely reason giue, That dead vnto my selfe, in you I liue. [V. Goe wayling accents] Goe wayling accents, goe Goe wayling accents, goe, to the Author of my woe, Say deere, say deere, why hide you so from him your blessed eyes, where hee beholds his earthly Paradise, Since hee hides not from you his hart, wherein loues heau'n, you may view, may view, wherein loues heau'n, you may view, you may view, you may view, loues heau'n you may view?

A Satyre, a Satyre once did runne away, did runne away for dread, At sound of horne, at sound of horne, which he himselfe did blow, did blow, Fearing and feared, fearing and feared, thus from himselfe he fled, hee fled, Deeming strange euill, deeming strange euill, deeming strange euill in that he did not know. Fearing and feared, thus from himselfe he fled, Deeming strange euill, deeming strange euill, strange euill, deeming strange euill in that he did not know. [VIII. O my thoughts] O my thoughts, O my thoughts, my thoughts, O my thoughts surcease O my thoughts, O my thoughts, my thoughts, O my thoughts surcease, Thy delights my woes increase, thy delights my woes increase, My life melts with too much thinking, Thinke no more, thinke no more, no more, no more, but dye in me, Till thou shalt reuiued be, At her lips, at her lips, at my Nectar, Nectar drinking, my Nectar drinking. Till thou shalt reuiued be, reuiued be, reuiued be, At her lips, at her lips, at her lips, my Nectar drinking. my Nectar drinking. [IX.

Free from loues bonds] Free from loues bonds I liued long Free from loues bonds I liued long, liued long, Free from loues bonds I liued long, I liued long, But now to loue, I change my song, With discords sweet, with discords, with discords sweet in euery straine, And of my ioy and pleasing paine, But out alas, alas my wounded hart, can neither rest, can neither rest, nor end my smart. But out alas my wounded hart, Can neither rest, can neither rest, nor end my smart. [XII.

There's not a groue that wonders not my woe] There's not a groue that wonders not my woe There's not a groue that wonders not my woe, Nor not a Rider weepes not at my tale, I heare the Eccho's, I heare the Eccho's, (wandring too and fro,) (wandring too and fro,) I heare the Eccho's, I heare the Eccho's, (wandring too and fro) too and fro, too and fro, too and fro, Resound my griefe, my griefe through euery hill and dale, resound my griefe, through euery hill and dale, through euery hill and dale, The Birds and beasts yet in their simple kinde, lament for me, no pitty else, no pitty else, I finde, no pitty else I finde, And teares I finde doe bring no other good, But as new showers, encrease the rising flood, but But as new showers, encrease the rising flood. [XXV. Dye not fond man] Dye not fond man, before, before thy day Dye not fond man, before, before thy day, before thy day, Loues cold December will surrender, To succeeding iocond May, iocond, iocond May, iocond May, And then, oh then, oh then, O then, O then, sorrow shall cease, sorrow shall cease, shall cease, shall cease, comforts abounding, abounding, comforts abounding, cares confounding, confounding, shall conclude, shall conclude a happy, a happy peace, shall conclude a happy, happy peace. [XXVI. I haue intreated and I haue complained] I haue intreated, and I haue complained I haue intreated, and I haue complained, I haue disprais'd, &amp; praise I likewise gaue, All means to win her grace I tryed haue, And still I loue, and stil I am disdained, &amp; still I am disdained, disdained, Oh, oh could my sighs, once purchase me reliefe, oh Or in her hart, my tears imprint my griefe, my teares imprint my griefe, imprint my griefe, But cease, cease, vaine sighs, cease, cease yee fruitlesse teares, Teares cannot pierce her hart, not pierce her hart, not nor sighes, nor sighes her eares. [XXVII. Come sable night] Come sable night, put on thy mourning stoale Come sable night, put on thy mourning stoale, And help Amintas sadly to condole, to condole, sadly to condole, Behold, the Sunne hath shut his golden eye, The day, the day is spent, And shades, and shades faire lights supply, All things in sweet repose, their labours close, Onely Amintas, Amintas, waft's his houres in wayling, in wayling, Whilst all his hopes doe faint, and life is fayling, whil'st all his hopes doe faint and life is fayling. and life is fayling. [XXVIII. Weepe forth your teares] In memory of Prince Henry. Weepe forth your teares, and doe lament Weepe forth your teares, and doe lament, lament, and doe lament, He's dead, he's dead, who liuing was of all the world beloued, Let dolorous lamenting still be spread, through all the earth, that all harts may be moued, To sigh, to sigh and plaine, since death hath slaine Prince Henery, Oh, oh had he liu'd, our hopes had still encreased, our hopes had still encreased, But he is dead, but he is dead, but he is dead, and all our ioyes, our ioyes deceased.
