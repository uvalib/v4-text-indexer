Wherin HN, witnesseth the Fall of Men and their Errour. The First Chapter. Prologve. A Longing-for-comfort. Oh! how doo I longue, for Comfort in these Dayes. It is no meruell, though my Heart can take no Rest: For after Good information, is my Demande alwayes Oh! how doo I longue, for Comfort in these Dayes. Coulde I descerne of al-things, No Playnt thus shoulde I rayse: For everyone woulde gladly, haue his Greefe redrest. Oh! how doo I longue, for Comfort in theise Dayes It is no meruell, though my Heart can take no Rest. Good-Information. To take-awaye all Math. [illeg.].a. Luk. 8.d. Sorowe, my Lust to redy [illeg.]rest: Also to comfort Those, that, through Discomfort; are in Care. The Seekers after Understanding (m[illeg.] what I heere declare:) Also Those, that? after good Information; are hungry: And Those likwyse, that? after Righteousnes; are thirsty/ These verely doo I feede, and can Math. [illeg.].a. Lu. 6.d. satisfy them all. And with my Iohn. 4.c. Water springs, refresh them Great &amp; Small: For thatt is my Seruice, my Custom and my Kynde. Longing-for-comfort. O! How good is then my ha[illeg.], that I thee heere doo fynde/ To bee; in my Discomfort? by thee right well appeased For thy Speach, hath my Heart, reioyst and greatly eased. Therfore misconceaue thou not, the longing of my Mynde, For first? in my Discomfort thus, bewrapped as the blynde; Woulde I very gladly, knowe how thou art named. B Good-Information. Uerely, of my Name, I am nothing-at-all ashamed/ Therfore? as it is meete; I wil tell thee in freendly fashion: I am? euen of eueryone; cald Good-informashion. With pleasant Mirth can I; by Informing; teache euery Wight, Satisfy the Demanders, &amp; increast their Understanding aright: For My Uce and Maner is, to disburden Mat. 11.d. Greef and Smart. Longing-for-comfort. O! now doo I beginne/to growe quyeted in my Heart/ Because it is my chaunce, to meete the heere so luckely. O Good information, none higher of Nobilety: None more-wyse and eloquent, nor greater of Ualue and Fame. For generally vppon Earth, whersuer thou comst, by Name, Thou pacifyest Contention/the deuided Sectes also: Yea, tho laden Conferences Esa. 62.a. Math. 11.d. with much Greef and wo, Dost thou; with holy Understanding; vnburden and discharge. Oh! how many Countryes? in length and greatnes large; Haue I raynged-ouer, with feruent Inclynacion/ For that I woulde bee counsailed, by Good information: And now do I fynde thee, heere present in this Place. Therfore? to my satisfying; I craue thy fauour and grace, That thou wilt instruct mee, what-ther-is Heere to doo? Good-Information. To informe thee therof, I willingly grant thertoo: For in this place of Mirth, the Loue hath such an Intention, With Rethorick? as thou shalt, perceaue by this Inuencion; To discouer dilligently; without Blemish any waye; The puer and sinceere Trueth, in maner of a Playe. Longing-for-comfort. Oh! Thou Reuyuer of my Mynd/what wilt thou heere reueale: Shall Rethorick now/the heauenly Trueth/declare and therin deale? Hah? Good information; thou speakest that ynaduisedly: Good-Information. O Longing for comfort, countst thon mee false &amp; contrary/ In that thou dost so wonder, at this thats Heere set-out? C Longing-for-comfort. No in very troth: But my Speech therof? no dout; Is only this: so ferr as I suppose, or any-waye can ges: That vnto Rethorict? in a Playe, of Mirth and Ioyfulnes; It doth not appertayne, to set foorth such a Work as this/ But to the Priests of the holy Church/Yet speake if I mis: For their Offices do Mal. 2. requyre, to set foorth such Uertue. Good-Information. That is very so, thou hast therin sayde most-true. Longing-for-comfort. Then answere my Demaunde, that my satisfying maye ensue, Touching that which shalbe Heere, set foorth &amp; brought to light: That I in this Mattier, may be vncombered quyt. Therfore disburden mee heerof, according to my Request. Good-Information. Then this I saye for Aunswer, to set thy Mynde at rest: The Loue hath now a desyer? with Rethorick; to declare Thatt which resteth hidden, Ephe. 3.b. from Many euery wheare/ Wherby to disburden, Mat. 11.d. the Man thats: full of Care: Because that hee at al tymes, a qu[illeg.]et Mynde maye bare. Therfore coms now the Loue, with sweet Rethorick, and shall Shew foorth apparantly, the Mans greeuous Fall. Longing-for-comfort. This geare seems yet to mee, most strainge to sonnde, all: Shall that same becom reuealed, by way of Enterlude? Haue Gods People don the like may wee so conclude? Or is it so to be founde, in their Scriptures that remayne? Instruct mee now of this, I praye thee once agayne: Or informe mee of it farder, with cleerer Declaracion. D Good-information. Then marke how y? Wo rlde, Sapien. 2. Mat. 6. 27. Mar. 14. [illeg.]5. Luk. 22. Iohn. 2. doth vex with Indignation, When-as men once beginn, of the Trueth to testifye. The false Teachers wil also, put downe those speedyly, That out of Gods Loue, the Trueth to witnes now, For saye then: Yee must yourselues, vnder our Knowledg bow/ And su[illeg.]? from vs; your Understanding, for to be com taught. At which their false Sayings, vnrightly to them caught Many at such tymes, keepe scilence and giue-waye. Among many Nations, now stands it at this stare: With score of Disputacions, 8. 18. 1 Timo. 1. 6. 2 Timo. 2. Tit. 3. And[illeg.] vnto much Disscentions stryfe: Also, to much Contencion, without Ioyfulnes of Lyfe. What a vayleth keeping scilence; this to quyet and redresse, So is now the Loue inclyned, with Rethorick, to expresse, The aufull Fall of Man, in maner of a Playe. Longing-for-comfort. Thatt? indeede; approoues thy Speech, which thou before didst saye: For the with am I? through thy cleere and good Informacion; Greatly set-at-quyet, in my Troublesom At[illeg.]yracion: For thus did I think flatly? I wil it not conceale; That it was quyt contrary? in a Playe; for to reueale, The Trueth of the Mans Fall, and Lyfe thus sore defyled/ And of the Peace wherout, hee hath himself exiled. But I must now alow thee, in all thou hast foorth braught. E Good-Information. Then consider farder, that the Worlde wil not be taught, But only by those, of then 2. Timo. 4. owne priuate choosing. Which is now the cause, of many a Soules loosing: Euen as it came-to-pas, in the time of Christ likewyse. For many f[illeg.]e Teachers? with Euny then did ryse/ And forbood Act. 4.b. 5. to heare any, but themselues, in any case. The Appostles Doctrine? for them; was much to base/ Because they were not Men, of Famous-learned-skyll. So now; withall Per[illeg.]sones; it lykewyse goeth still/ Which to the holy Church, contemne and much dispise: Blaspheame and charge the Loue, with Packs of forged Lyes/ And know not-at-all/ Abac. 1.a. Act. 13.c. what God both work nor how. Therfore hath the Loue, taken vppon her now/ The Trueth? in thissame Playe; apparantly to showe. Longing-for-comfort. O? Good information; tis much that thou dost knowe. Declare yet faeder vnto mee, what? ce[illeg.]e shall now beginn. F Good-information. Heere shalbe played a Playe of Myndes, as shall appeere therin: Therfore marke thou well, what I shewe heere to thee: Beholde, the Mans Crowne, heere mayst thou playnly see/ Which he? through his sining; hath left or forsaken/ And hath in strainge Pathes, Esa. 53.a. the Waye of Errour taken. Euen then is the Kingdom? vvith his personages; shevved in his Garnishing Comprehende this well in Mynde, that is Declared heere. For lo/in maner of Enterlude, to thee shall playne appeere, The inward Kingdom of God, voyde of Greefe and Smart/ The which is founde to bee, Luk. 17.b. with in the Man[illeg.]his Hart/ By God himself buylded, Mat. 25.d. ere the Worlde began to bee. Beholde theare, the peaceable Loue without Compulcion; free. Also, the Reasonablnes of Nature, in like case. Obedience likewyse, to present theare in place/ Together with the Ioye, very louely in Dilight. In the Midst of the Kingdom? dismay not at this Sight; Theare stands the Trueth, that giueth Lyfe and Breath: Also the Knowledg, wheron doth cleaue the Death. Playne-and-iust doth theare, walke in Ioyful-state/ With his Cogitacions, a bolde and ventrous Mate: Also the Searcher, which wil not shrink nor start. Therfore stande thou still, and do not hence depart. Giue-eare attentiuely, let thyne Understanding awake: For Mans Fall, they wil, to thee apparant make, In maner of a Playe. Longing-for comfort. Now sure it shall not scave me, till part therof I take. It were not good the Mynde of it, from me shoulde slipp awaye. The Ende of the Prologue. Receaue this thankfully, for the Prologue of our Playe. Pavsa I. The Second Chapter. A Ioye. Sweetnes Eccl. 24.b. and Ioye, is my Exercise always: Which God? in my Motions; worketh, to his Prayse. Godly sweete Plasures, [illeg.]al. 5.c. A[illeg.].a. are my Conditions likewyse. Wheare I am, men are ioyfull, in All they exercyse/ Ther [illeg.] 21.c. 2[illeg.].b. is in Gods Kingdom, no euell Act, nor Lamenting. I liue ioyfully with God, Iohn. 8.d. in his Daye, to my Contenting. To the Welfare of Playne-and-iust, I do my best indeuer. Loue. In the exercising of Loue, my Ioyes do still perseuer/ Which God worketh? in Mee; without Tediousnes or Payne. I Loue, am Mat. 11.d. [illeg.]Cor. 13.a. Long suffering/as men may see ful-playne: Also freendly, in all my Beeing, Nature, and Kynde. Through Mee, the liueing God, is declared, he do fynde: For God, Ioh. 4.a. to the Loue, compared is ful-right. I Loue, haue neuer, reiected any Wight. I wil-not deceaue, 1 Cor. 13.a. nor enuy Any-man: And to exalt myself, I neuer did nor can. I am pacient in Suffering/for God is my Stabilitee. All this? to Playne-and-iust; doth chance for his Comoditee. I am likewyse? in my Mynde; both peaceable and mylde. All this is Gods owne Worke: for Hee the same doth bylde. Wheare I dwell, Ioh. 14.c. 1. Ioh. 4.[illeg.] Apo. 21.a. is Gods Howse/and theare? in vpright vce; God is most truly serued, without any Abuce: For God hath? in his Kingdom; Mee therto ordayned/ That I should? Playne-and-iust; reioyce with Ioye vnfayned. B Reasonablenes. I Reasonablnes, am vpright in Nature. Which God doth work in Mee, that am his own Figure: Because I shoulde vse Measure, in all I take-in-hande. For in all my Walkings, reasonable I stande: In all my Meate and Drink, I am reasonable too. Reasonable, in all my Works, that I diuise and doo. Measure is? in eury Thing; my Teaching and Forth-bringing. I laude my God alwayes, Col. 3.b. Ieam. 5.b. with Playing and with Singing. For I am the true Compas, and the right Path also: Wherby it may alwayes, with Playne-and-iust, wel go. Obedience. To be obedient vnto God, thatt is my Manifestacion: Which God doth work in Mee, to his Prayse and Gloryfycation. I seeke not also, Ioh. 5. [illeg.] myne owne Honour to procure: But I am obedient, vnto Gods Doctrine pure. I neuer shrinke from Hym, through any bad Intencion. I seeke neither Suttletee, nor any New-inuencion. I cannot any-way, Gods holy Lawe transgresse. Therfore liues Playne-and-iust, with Mee in Quyetnesse. C Trueth. I Trueth, am High-priest, in Gods Kingdom, alway/ In Mee, theternall Lyfe, is firme, without decaye. That doth my true Father, work in Mee aright. For in his mighty Kingdom, I am Iohn. 1.a. [illeg.].b. the perfect Light: Also my Fathers Ioh. 14.a. Waye, like as tis written ryfe: The right Ioh. 15.a. Uyne-stock, and the eternall Lyfe. For without the Trueth, God cannot pleased bee. Therfore the High-priests-office, Hebr. 5. 6. 7. 8. hath Hee resignd to Mee. I am the Tree Gen. 2.a. Pro. b. Ier. 7.b. Apo. [illeg.].a. of Lyfe, out of Loue bloweing. If Playne-and-iust do still, in Mee; remayne growing, Then with him at all tymes, shall it go right-well. All Gen. 7.c. Nations shall serue him, that vnder Heauen do dwell: For him hath God loued, and likewyse elected: But if he fall from Mee, he is lost and quyt reiected: For I am the Esa. [illeg.]8.d. 1. Cor. 3.b. Ephe. 2.d. 1. Pet. [illeg.].a. Foundation, the right Grounde-stone. Ther is not any other, but I myself alone, Wheron all Understanding, must euermore be grounded. Although ther be many Testimonyes, florishingly forth-sounded/ Yet do I counsaile Playne and-iust, with Mee to tary still. Which if he doo, noman then, can him destroye or kill. D Knowledg. I Knowledg, to beholde, am pleasant and delectable. God worketh through Mee, his Prophecie vnfaylable. Through Mee, God reuealeth his high holy Name. I am very meete, to set-foorth his Honour and Fame: For who can in Knowledg, Sap. [illeg.]. Rom. 11.d. 1. Cor. [illeg.].b. God exceede or-yet com-ny? Whoso vseth Mee, must needes exalt Pro. 6.b. Sap. 7. 8. Eccl. 24.b. himself on-hy. Therfore also hath God? with Mee; his Work alone. For with the mighty Knowledg, He excelleth eueryone, In Knowledg, is Hee, extolled aboue All. In Knowledg, can noman, with God becom equall. In Knowledg of the Trueth, his Work it is miraculous: But without Knowledg of y? Trueth, I work y? Death pernitious. Whosoeuer toucheth Me, my Bewty for to inherit/ Hee must? through my Fruits; dye Gen. 2. 3. from the Lyfe in Spirit. Therfore must Playne-and-iust, from mee auoyde and fly. If he take-on my Fruit, into Wo he coms therby: For I am only, for Gods owne Speculacion. Whoso tyes himself to Mee, coms into Tribulacion: And is from all Ioye, very farr excluded. But God can want nothing, nor-yet be deluded: For the Lyfe of the Trueth, in Him is firmly sett: Therfore do all those, much Ueracion gett/ Which, without the Trueths Lyfe; Mee do touch or handle. E Searcher. I Searcher, am very hardy, and do not feare nor tremble/ And subtiller, then all Gen. 3.a. created Beasts, am I, God doth both Heart and Neynes? through Mee; Psal. [illeg.] Ier. [illeg.].b. Apo. [illeg.] fearth-out and cry: For I, with nimble Powers; do search both high and lowe. God doth the Mans Thoughts? by Mee; fynde-out and knowe. I am searching, in subtle Fore-cast or wyly Inuencion. Therfore do they all likewyse, avowe into great Contencion, Which (without Knowledg of y? Trueth) do fondly Mee beleeue. But so long as Playne-and-iust, no care to Mee doth geeue/ And that his Thoughts/to y? Searching, do not bende their Lust/ Then it shall at al-tymes, go-well with Playne-and-iust. Playne-and-iust. I Playne-and-iust, liue quyetly, in my Degree. Playne-and-iust, hath God almighty, created Mee. My Customable-dealing, is for Plant Gen. 1.[illeg.]Eccl. 17.[illeg.]. and Till. In God may I tryumph, in ioyful-maner still/ With my Thougts: which are to helpe me? in my Power; alwaye. For? out of Mee; God hath them brought, to be my helpe and Staye. Therfore also am I to her? with my gentil Loue; inclyned: For God hath Ce[illeg.]. 2.[illeg.]. gott her out of Mee, and her to me assyned: To the intent that wee? as his louely Company; Shoulde keepe his godly Esa. 60. 61. Iohn. 15.a. Plantings, that they mought growe and multiply. Cogitacions. I Cogitacions? in Gods Kingdom; am doutles very Meeke. I do not fayle or decaye, in Ioyful-solace sweete. Playne-and-iust is appoynted, the Headd Gen. 3.b. 1. Cor. 14.d. of my Dealing. With Playne-and-iust therfore, is my Course-of-walking. For God hath ioyned me to him, together for to dwell. And Playne-and iust likewyse, contenteth mee right well. We keepe ourselues together, as one-anothers Mate. What God doth Mat. 19.a. Mark. 10. ioyne together, shall noman seperate. Thus liue we heere at libertee/in Peace exceeding greate, But of the Tree of Knowledg, we may in no wyse Gen. 2.b. eate: Because that wee in al things, may haue good Succession. The Third Chapter. A Searcher. O Noble Cogitacions, think thou on no Suppression. But Search thou after Knowledg, and consider of it duly: For Through Knowledg, shall ye be like Gen. 3.a. God in Knowledg, truly. Hadst thou once Knowledg, God were not then aboue thee. And if thou byde simple, Who shall commende or loue thee? But if thou haue Knowledg? like God of worthy prayse; Of Good and Euell/then mayst thou, compare with Him alwayes. Therfore lay holde of the Fruit, to thy Commodyous gayne/ And so? both Good and Euell; learne thou to know more playne. Wherfore shouldst thou not, search out euery thing? Cogitacions. Because I feare it woulde, Gods Cursse vppon vs bring For althings great and small, we Gen. 3.a. vse them eury one/ Gaue the gorgious Knowledg, excepted heere alone: For God Gen. 2.b. hath forbodd vs, to touch the same Tree. Searcher. Yea, but had ye Knowledg/ Gen. 3.a. as Gods then were yee, What shoulde ther be then, that mought you hurt or Le[illeg.]? Noman coulde then, himself agaynst you sett. Were ye not as then, like God in Power-strong? Cogitacions. I begin; through Searching; after it to long. For vnto the Knowledg, my Lusts are all prest. Searcher. Take-holde of it hardly, and then liue thou in Rest. For if thou hadst Knowledg, then wert-thou set-at liberty. Use then thy Ioye, and set-asyde all Phantasy: For althings; to you; then, wil chance in right-good-state. Therfore take the same vnto you, deferr it not to late/ Then? according to my Aduice; ther can noman ouer you raigne. B Cogitacions. Thear fynde I? through Searching; a good Instruction, certayne. I wil surerly not esteeme it? as a Tryfle; in-any-case. Notwithstanding, we are heere, permitted in this place, To vse all-finde of things, whatsever heere Gen. 2. we fynde. But the Knowledg man we not, open or vnbunde. With thatt we must not deale, God hath forbodd it specially. But all the other Fruits, are to our Comodity. We may use of them, at al-tymes when we will. Beholde: theternall Ioye, is heere in presence still: Wherin our Heart, man reioyce and take delyte. Heere is also 1. Cor. 1[illeg.]. Love, that can satisfy vs ryte: Wherthrough we liue continually, in peaceable Gyse. Moreouer, heere is Reasonablenes, manifest likewyse: Wherin our Nature keepeth, Measure, Night and Daye. For Reasonablnes doth keepe, the very-right Highwaye. His Testimony is, all requisite Conuenience. And heere is likewyse, Gods dutifull Obedience/ Which teacheth vs to bow, Iam. 5.a. 1. Pet. 5.b. vnder God Omnipotent. From God and from his Loue, to receaue our Norishment: As also Gods Honour (and not our selues) to seeke. Searcher. Yea, wil ye bewrapp yourselues in such Obedience meeke? That is Gods 1. Reg. 15. Pleasure, and his Will indeede: But so can ye neuer, to the Knowledg proceede. For whoso the Commandement, doth not search and scann, He remayneth alwayes, a simple foolish Man: And to be leadd heere and theare, is very-well-content. Not once knowing rightly (thissame is euident) Whither thatt which is tolde him, be either good or yll. But through Knowledg one becows? like God; Gen. 3.a. full of Skill. Through Searching, you shall fynde it, very-so to bee. For Obedience, 1. Reg. 15. doth but [illeg.]ynde, and restrayne you ye see/ And teacheth you to go, without Math. 16. Luk. 14. your owne Will: Whatsoeuer you think-good, ye Deut. 12.a. 29.c. must let it stand-still: Yea, all what ? to be good for you; ye can deuyse and make. C Cogitacions. Now Uerely I do yeelde me, to that which thou dost speake. For in Searching I do fynde, that very-so it is Also, touching Gods Commaundement, I am not sure of this/ Whether I must be so obedient, ther vnto, or no. I likewyse comprehende it not: this makes me full of woe But Knowledg, is exceeding Gen. 3. delytfull before Mee, For shee is honorable in Actions/and bewtyfull to see. Therfore wil I not ? Obedience; so much regard: But all my Thoughts I wil, inclyne hitherward, Namely, to the Searching, with all wyly Suttlety: To thend that I may knew, Good and Euell, perfectly/ And towards the Knowledg, my Course I wil direct/ Her Fruits ? into mee; to receaue, to that effect: For I wil in no case, thy good Cousaile dispyse. Searcher. Search after it hardly, be counsayld in this wyse/ So mayst thou inherit the Knowledg, of all the things that are. Whatsoeuer thou then th[illeg.]tst Esa. 30.b. good, than do not thou forbare: And what thou thinkest euill, let thatt be quyt reiected/ Then shalt thou, in Citee &amp; Towne; liue free and wel protected: And noman also then, to deceaue thee can preuayle. Tell me Cogitacions, what shoulde thee then fayle? Wert thou not then ? in all Lands; the most comly Dame? But if thou byde simple, then comst thou into shame: Wheare is then thyne Honour? haue that in thy Remembrance. D Cogitacions. That is very-true: Who then mought work vs Hinderance? For Knowledg doth reueale perfect Doctrine vnto Men: When I knowe Good and Euell/who may be my Lorde then? Are wee not then like Gen. 3. God, by obtayning this our Lust? Searcher. O yeas: but otherwyse, Rom. 6.[illeg.]. Gods Captiues byde ye must. B[illeg.]ake of the Fruit Gen. [illeg.]. hardly (for that is myne Aduice) If the Knowledg of Good and Euell, which is so great of price. And [illeg.] of the right Seasen, of Pleasures manyfolde. The Fowerth Chapter. A Cogitacions. Lo, I wil venture it, with cheerfull Heart and bolde: And take to me the Fruit/ Gen. 3. for tis rery sweete of Kynde. Searcher. How tasteth it I pray you? tell me as ye fynde. Cogitacions. Uery-well no-doubt/for it is an High-mynde/ Which giues me to vnderstande, that I am a noble Figure. Wheare is-ther now I saye, one such another Creature? As I do new ? inwardly; conceaue myself to bee. Who is-ther I beseech you, that now excelleth Mee? Beeing so witty as I am now, in this Place voyde of Care. Holde ther, Playne-and-iust/take thou with me a Share. For fauourable to thee ? in my Purchase; am I. Searcher. How doth it like thee? Playne-and-iust. Altogether Sap. 1.b. Rom. 5.b. deadly: for I shall therof dye. It is a deadly Bitt to mee/thus geuen or parted-a sunder: For I Playne-and-iust, must now henceforth, go-vnder: Because y? Esa. 1.a. Oze. 4.a. Math. 7.a. Deceauer with Falshod, coms now to beare y? swaye. B Searcher. Do now but beholde, how his Neck doth stande, I praye. I haue brought it to-pas, 2. Corin. 11.a. that the Man is becom deceaued: For sure he had it not, within his Power contayned: Still in the Trueth ? like God; firme to stande. Planne-and-iust. O Cogitacions, what hast thou tooke-in-hande? Doest thou think heerin, that thou hast Wisdom founde? O No: for the Knowledg, is to mee vnbounde/ Wherby Gen. 3.b. I do perceaue, we are Uessells poore and beare. Th'I must lament, this Act, euery-wheare: Thou wilt suerly bring me vnder, that appeereth certenly, Through Knowledg, without Understanding of the Uerety, Oh! How am I thus, com into Greefe and Mysery? I wanted nothing/but liud in althings ioyfully. Whither I were in High-estate, or in lowe Degree/ Yet was I wel contented, in all that fell to Mee. O Cogitacions, what Euell &amp; Mischeefe hast thou wrought. By aduancing thyself in Pryde, Gen. 1.b. [illeg.] Sap. 1.b. 2.c. Rom. 5.b. the Death on me hast brought It is very yll diuisd, in this Uale of Delectacion. Cogitacions. This Fault is not all myne, as I wil make Probation: For before our Fall, through all corners did we pas, Till that I did com, to the Searcher, wheare he was: Hee with crafty woords vnto me did showe/ That all and eury Thing ? like God; I did not knowe. This hath deceaued Gen. 3.b. Sap. 2.c. 2. Cor. 11.a. vs, as now we see the same. C Trueth. Therfore shall all those, that such Works do frame/ Fynde nothing els but Discord, and Uaryance, therby: For wheare the Cogitacions, themselues do apply, Gods Commander[illeg.] with Knowledg; to examin or search-out Theare becoms the Concord, cleane worne-awaye, no-dout: For eueryone theare, doth seeke his owne Liberty. But through Mee [Trueth] shalbe Gen. 3.b. troden downe vtterly, The Head of the Searcher, with his Deedes most vnfitt. But if the Cogitacions, wil not herself submytt, To the same Grace, with all her Might and Power/ So shal-ther then be founde, Gen. 6.b. Esa. 30.b. Ier. 7.c 18.b. 4. Esd. 3.a. in the Thoughts eury Hower. Such Fruits as Good-thinking, doth yeeld and still Deuyse. Playne-and-iuste shall bewayle it, in most lamenting wyse. For he shalbe distressed and ouer lorded quyt: And shalle ? by the Thoughts; be turned from the Right/ As also ? mi[illeg.]h Wofulnes; lye wrooting in Self will. All Contrarynes likewyse, shall meete with him still/ Till that he Gen. 3.b. Deu. 31.b. com agayne, vnto such a pas, Euen Playne Math. 8. Mar. 10.m. Gen. 3.c. and Iust, as heertofore he was. Now therfore get ye Gen. 3.c. hence, with all your trembling cheere/ Ye may in no wyse liue, in any High-mynde heere: For God only is high, yea, the Highest of Exaltacion. Also heere may not be, any Wayling nor Esa. 65.b. Apoc. 21.a. Lamentacion. Therfore ye must abrode, into the Uale of Teares and Wo: And Theare shall you fynde, in euery Path ye go/ Your Adherents and Companyons, to you agreeing best. The Place is from you shutt, Math. 25. Apo. 21. of Ioye and quyet Rest/ With diuers-kinde of Snarings, and Perplexitee of Hart/ With Feare, and much Anguish, Gen. 3.b. Deu. 31.b. full of greeuous-smart/ With also the Accusation, of your Disobedience: All which ? for your Inconstancie; is the iust Recompence. PAVSA II. Heere is the Kingdom shutt: and before vppon the Doore, a Cherubin or Angel sett/vvith a fyry Svvord: vppon the Svvord ? in a Role [illeg.] vvritten, Feare of Heart. and vppon the Angel, Accusacion. The V. Chapter. A Playne-and-iust. Oh! what shall I doo? whither shall I go for Remedy? Who shall now disburden me, of this my wofull Misery? Or wheare is any good Counsaile ? for our Comfort; to be hadd? Cogitacions. Content yourself I pray you/the Matter is not so badd. Nor yet any such Offence, to take on thus therfore. Plane-and-iust. Gen. 3.c. 4. Esd. 3.a.Oh! I am? in all my Beeing; disquyeted very-sore: I may ? our vnconstant Lyfe; with iust cause, lament. For therfore: are we now, dreeuen-foorth and packing sent Out of the Kingdom of God, the Place of Rest and Trust/ Into the Uale of Teares/wheare I ? against my Lust; In dying still must dye/and greeuous Suffring beare. Cogitacions. Tush, I haue an high Mynde/feare it not an Heare. B Good-thinking. Yea/yea: wel sayd/what maner of Speache heare I theare? I com to you verely, as a safe Preseruer. Ye are welcom hither, my deere Sister and Brother. Be not so sorowfull, in this straing sort now. For the High-mynde, which ye haue brought with you/ That same wil we carefully ? for our Portion; saue: High-mynde, thats such a Morsell, as we woulde wish to have: Yea, it is very honorable, and not to discommende. I wil showe you Wonders, therfore to mee attende. For we are now heere, Sap. 2.a. in the earthly Paradise-of-pleasure. Playne-and-iust. To heare of thatt, doth sure delyte me out-of measure. For my Mynde is altogether, to the Rest inclynde. But my Thoughts do vex me, wherseuer I do wynde. And sorowfull Heauynes, hath prest me downe flatt. Unregarding. Soft Sers/theare must I be among you, with my mery Thatt. Saluted be you beer/deere Freends altogether. You honorable of Fame, ye are right welcom hether/ Into this Place of Delectacion, voyde of all Shame. Cogitacions. Who art thou my Frende? Unregarding. I am calde Unregarding/and thatt is my Name/ Uery-well reported, for a prudent wyse man. Playne-and-iust. I do much reioyce me, to fynde the heere than. But tell me I praye thee/canst thou inuent Mirth and Gladnes? Unregarding. O yea: therfore harken to me, and be eased of the Sadnes. Thou must in euery Crafty act, still vnregarding bee. And let alwayes Esa. 30.[illeg.]. Good-thinking, teache and preache to thee: Holde thy self at quyet therin/and determyne theron to bylde. Good-thinking. Doo euenso: and I wil the ache thee as myne owne Childe. Therfore ? to our Exhortation; giue-ouer thy self euen-thus. C Playne-and-iust. That do we most willingly/vouchsafe to accept of vs: For according to thy Woords, we holde vs quyet still. Good-thinking. Then pluck now on, this Garment of Self will: Then do they pluk[illeg.] on other Garments, vvherupp? standeth vvritten Self-vvill. And learne to get you Heapes, of our Wisdom, what you maye/ For then shall Playne-and-iust, in you, soone dye-awaye: And studye in the Knowledg, like Clerkes of deepe Discerning/ So may you then growe strong, or furnishe wel in Lerning: And shall knowe how to tel-foorth much, very conningly: Then shall ye alwayes, with vs haue your company. All what you Sap. 2. think good, to thatt do stifly stande: Although yee shoulde therfore, be killed out of hande. Thus let not Self-myndednes, be got from you in any case. And your Headds shall ye like wyse, couer in euery place With spitfull Indignation, Oze. 4.[illeg.] Sap. 2. Rom. 1.c. and with cruell Enuy. Ye shall also bragg, of your large Wisdom, highly. And shoo you on each Foote (mark what I institute) With Diligence, all such Blood, Eze. 22.a. Mat. 23. 26. Act. 7. 6. to vex and persecute No wil ryse against Good-thinking, and therto disagree. Cogitacions. We do yeelde ourselues ouer, thy Seruants for to bee. Playne-and-iust. Uouchsafe to teache vs I thee praye, according to thy Pleasure D Unregarding. Be alwayes Sap. 1. mery euery Daye, for thats a noble Treasure. And be vnregarding vtterly, in althings what you heare: In our accord, liue Merely, and cast-by Greef and Feare. And ? to glory in your High-mynde; let nothing trouble you. Good-thinking. All what y? Thoughts, in themselues, think good and do alow. That same see you follow, wherseuer you vse your Hanting: Be it Right or Wrong/for thatt is our Implanting/ And we two dilligent Wayters, wil in no-wyse you forsake. Unregarding. O no: but ? to your Benefite; a speciall Care wil take, Your Myndes alwayes to gouerne, right-well, on euery-syde. And then can you prooue althings, &amp; Good from Badd, deuyde, Through your dilligent Study, in our prudent Understanding. Good-thinking. Those which speake against vs, deface them all, with Slandring/ Feare nomans Hande, that subiect to vs is not bounde: For Good-thinkings vnholy Exhortation, profounde/ Ye must with such Acts, in any-case obserue. E Unregarding. Thus neuer let your Exercise, from our Counsayle swarue: For in our loueing Grace, to your Weale and Preseruation/ We do courteously receaue you, into our Congregacion/ And wil alwayes walke together, as Freendshipp doth vs bynde. Cogitacions. We thank you both most-hartely, for this your Dealing kynde/ And for the Understanding that ye haue to vs declared Plane-and-iust. We two wil not shrink from you, nor sodaynly be feared: Nor-yet forsake your Counsayles ? like Fooles that nothing knowe; But beleeue whatsoeuer, into our Eares you blowe. Pavsa III. The VI. Chapter. A Unregarding. How sayst thou ? Good-thinking; is not this handled tryckly? Good-thinking. Ye as I assure thee: we haue compast it quickly: For when the Man was falne, and began once to lament/ Then was-ther noman found, that coulde him better content, Then wee two suttle Spirits, which do ? in craft; excell. Unregarding. The Sysze of our Last, doth fitt their Foote right-well. Wherfore with myne Eys, great Ioy I now beholde. But the Man shall yet repent it, with Sorrows manyfolde: For through vs, must he yet ? with Sighing; feare and tremble. Good-thinking. Peace/bring him into no Feare, but still with him dissemble. For I wil perswade him, that his Understanding is very sounde/ And he shall weene, that ? through Good-thinking; he hath Wisdom founde. For Esa. 30.a. Eze. 22.a. Good-thinkings Attonement, is pleasant to him indeede. Therfore ? without Arguing; foorth-on let vs proceede: For the Man doth towards vs, all his Longing sett. Unregarding. We two ? I perceaue; can all Men captiue gett: How wyly soeuer they bee, into our Traps they fall. Then do into our Netts, yeelde them captiue all: Spirituall, Temporall Simpleons, and Clerks of great Report B Good-thinking. They do almost all ? for Succour; vnder our Wings resort For we two generally ? of all Men; are the Gouernours. But therin Cosen am I, the cheefe of the Commishonours: For verely I Good-thinking, the greatest swaye do beare. Through Good-thinking I deceaue, Man and Woman eury wheare. Many lay People, do beleeue the suttle Sleights I frame. Thear-are olso many Learned ones, Ier. 21.b. 27.a. 29.a. Eze. 1[illeg.].b. that preache in my Name. Thus am I ? among all Names; the Cheefest of Renowne. Unregarding. O Good-thinking, thou shalt not so disgrace and put me downe For I am the First borne, and ? before the; begunne. When Man grew vnregarding, and by falling, was vndunne/ Did he com first, into Good-thinkings Hands? The Man ? being plaest, in the Best of all Landes; Became ? euen-theare; Unregarding, in his Thoughts/ And Disobeyed Gen. 3. 1. Reg. 1[illeg.]. God/by setting his Woord at noughts: Takeing on him, Knowledg, in steede of the liueing Ueritee. Thus ? by vnregarding; first, the Man grew to Debillitee: And fel alway from God, in his owne Knowledg, going-astraye All this haue I myself brought forth, as heere in breefe I saye. Euen thus did I gett Power, heer-at take thou no storne. And so after thatt, wert thou ? Good-thinking; borne. Therfore keepe thou silence, in clayming Superioritee. C Good-thinking. But tell me ? Unregarding; what shewst thou heere for Auctoritee/ Like vnto Mee so fyne/that am helde as Apo. 17.18. a Prophet, in eury Lande. For tis now almost all Good-thinking, what any one doth Understande: In this sort am I gotten, to be Cheefe aboue thee. Unregarding. How shouldst thou haue made the man beleeue anything if hee Had not first ? through Mee; growen to be so negligent? Good-thinking. Freend Unregarding, what are thy pleasant Pads of Meryment? They are nothiug-at-al, except my Exhortation be theare. I haue surely caught euryone, with in Good-thinkings Snare. For in Mee, then do almost all, seeke their Sap. 2.a. Rom. 1. 5. Comfort at all Seasons. And out Good-thinkings Theame, then do also frame ther Reasons. Thus hast thou nothing like Mee, thou vnregarding Pratler. Unregarding. Thou mayst well holde thy peace, thou dissembling Tatler/ For with thy Babling, thou bringst Men into Afflictions store/ To that they ? by meanes of theer enuy each other very sore. Thou makst the People rebellious, with thy Seede of Dissention. But I Unregarding, do only Mirth frame and mencion. So much ? thou Hipocrite; am I nobler then Thou. D Good-thinking. O but soft Unregarding/wheare is thy Holynes now? Like-as I bring forth thesame, Esa. 58.a. Mat. 23.b. Col. 2.c. in fayned Hipocresy/ With the which, I do dayly, mingle my self ful craftely/ Among the Learned, the Wyse, and great of Estimacion. Unregarding. I am also mingled, with the high of Reputacion: For I Unregarding, am the Worlds delytfull Melody. Good-thinking. But yet I Good-thinking, am the Headd of their Hipocrisy/ Which do al-tymes set forth, fayned Holynes to be enured. Unregarding. Now thear art thou wyde/for I haue ? vnder my Power; allured. The Worlde with her Wyse, both Men and Women, fitt/ That liue Sap. [illeg.].a. 14. Rom. 1. [illeg.]. a. Pet. 2.b. Ind[illeg.]b. Unregarding, and Folly do committ/ And of thy good-thinking Holynes, their recning is but small/ Nor-yet of thy Seede, that thou chokest Man with all/ With thy suttly Deuices, which thou dost forge and set-out. E Good-thinking. I perceaue wel that we two, can rule all rounde-about, With our directions, in Worldly and Spirituall, likewyse: Though then all liue ? through vs; in neuer so beastly Gyse/ Thatt is not regarded, men may perceaue it truly. Unregarding. But if a Man fayne himself, and go to Church duly/ Then is he well accounted of, though his Godnes be not much. Good-thinking. Yea, he shoulde soone be caught by the Throte, if he were any such, That oughts, but what Good-thinking aloweth, shoulde like-of and defende. Unregarding. But Whoso ? Unregarding, and Good thinking; doth commende/ Hee reioyceth greatly, because he doth honour vs twayne, But in our filthy Uices, and Workes peruerse and vayne, Wee Two are doutles, the cheefe Ministers of Hell. Good-thinking. Then let vs equall Fellowes bee, and both together dwell: And giue me now thy hande, in this League of our Equallitee. And I wil no more aboue thee, clayme the Principalitee: But alwayes by thy Syde, wil waite, euen hande-in-hande. Unregarding. Then let vs no more each other, enuyously withstande: But be mery still together, and in nowyse to Lament: To the ende that our Kingdom, in peeces be not rent. For we continue vnreproued in the Generation of Men. The VII. Chapter. A Good-thinking. Heere cometh Playne-and-iust. Unregarding.

Ther is nothing that doth better, to our Lyking fall/ Then ? in the Wynde; to let all blowe at venture wylde/ And to satisfy ourselues ? by Good-thinking; like a Chylde: As we haue heere to that effect, had good Informacion. Cogitacions. Wee must alwayes giue you both, worthy Comendation/ And account Good-thinking, for our graue Counseler: For of our Greefe and Anguise, hee is the Disburthener: Let vs therfore accorde together, in one consent of Mynde. C Good-thinking. Go-to, we wil be mery, with this Gayne that heere we fynde, Our Spinning is not easy, to reele ? as I suppose;: Though men, from many Parishes, therunto were chose/ Yet shoulde they not in hast, our snarled Worke vnwynde. Com on now ? Unregarding; display thee in thy kynde, Make vs now som Mirth/grounde suerly thy Forte: Let vs sing, spring, and daunce/and make a litle Sporte: And then let vs eate awhile, and drinke without all Measure/ So may we forgett the tyme, with Ioye and worldly Pleasure. The VIII. Chapter. A Heere do these fovver Parsonages take-each other by the hande, and daunce: and from-vvith-in, or out-from-aboue, one singeth this Song ensuing, befoore: and then ? in dauncing-maner; these fovver Parsonages sing it after him: or els, Vnregarding singeth it first or before. A Now Can[illeg.]. 14. make you mery and reioyce/ And harken duly to my Uoyce/ What I shall vtter now: The Man he Gen. 1. Sap. 2. was created free/ And voyde of any Plantasee/ That must I shewe to you. In Freedom was he sett likwyse/ Whear no Berashou mought aryse/ Had he bode at that staye: But Gen. 3. Subtilte becam his Mate: The Searhing, as you [illeg.] Loose his free Lyfe awaye. His Gen. 3.b. [illeg.]. Esd. 3.a. subtill Counsayle forth did flowe/ And sought both Good and Euell to knowe/ To becom like God in Might: Now when the Man tooke-on this Deede/ Then brought he foorth 4. Es. 4.d. Math. 13.b his false Seede: Playne-and-iust must dye then quight. B He liked well a lofty Esa. 14.b. Mynde/ Wherin he stole, from God so kynde, His Honour/and woulde be free. He hasted that he mought be wyse And prudent/foe to enterpryse/ His owne Lorde for to bee. But then was he captiued the more, With greeuous Bands and cumbers store/ He Selfues did prouyde. Therin did he proceede and trust: In Searching then ? with Longing; must, Good-thinking be his Gyde. Good-thinkings Gen. 67. 19. Math. 24. Luk. 17. Plague ? which I resyte; Is altogether the Worlds Delyte/ The Trueth from her is taken: Without Lamenting, still they liue/ And vnto Stryfe, themselues do giue/ The Peace, hath Esa. 48. 57. them forsaken. C Hate and Rom. 1. Enuy euery-wheare, Now the greatest Swaye doth beare/ Trueth must not speake nor moue: Now raigneth Mocking and Deryding/ Persecuting, Eze. 22.b Slaundring, with Upbreyding: But inuisible goeth the Iohn. 5.[illeg.] Loue. Beloved Wight of worthy Fame/ Consider well of all thissame: Ensue the Loues Comunyaltye: If that the Trueth com to thy sight/ Be simple Mat. 18.

A Oh Anguish/oh ruful-state and Misery/ Oh blynde Rom. 1.c. Ephe. 4.b. Apoc. 3.b. Man, that art so ignorant vtterly: Now foolishly, dost thou wander astraye! Thou art growen corrupt, like the Lazer most filthy/ Which art from the Headd, [illeg.]a. [illeg.].a. to the Foote-sole ? I saye; Altogether deformed/thou canst it not denaye: Ther is suerly in all thy Members, not any sounde part. Moreouer, thou hast yeelded; to Unregardings Waye/ And Esa. 3.b. Ier. 7.c. 11.a 1[illeg.] 18.b. into Good-thinkings Path, farr entred thou art. Oh! Playne-and-iust, lyeth vnder now in Smart: And Good-thinking Esa. 30.b., the-whyles; teacheth Ignorance &amp; Tangling. I must this Daye lament it, with Wofulnes-of-hart: Oh! Deut. 23. Esa. [illeg.].a. When shall the Man, becom Understanding? Oh, Ignorance! how canst thou ouer the Man thus raigne, That he can nothing-els, vnderstand, learne, nor gayne/ But thatt wherto Good-thinking, Deu. 12. 29. doth dayly him direct. Self-will, doth likewyse, increase in him amayne. He reioyceth in Self-myndednes, and wil it not reiect. Enuyousnes and Crueltee, he doth prayse and much respect. To persecute Gen. 4. innocent Blood, hee is also redy and gladd. He is soone mooued-to-fury, and grinneth ? in effect; At Another, like a Dogg, thats fierce and raging-madd. Oh! Wheare is now I pray you, the Oze. 4. sweete Loue to be hadd? When shall Man therby be cured, is now my Demanding? Who ? without Gods Kingdom; is growen foolish too-too-badd, Oh! when shall the Man, becom Understanding? B It seemes as if the Kingdom of God were locked quight/ And also that God, with his heauenly Hoste-of-might, Had withdrawen his Grace, from the Man, cleane-awaye: For He suffereth the Man, Gen. 6.a. 4. Esd. 3.a. to follow his owne Delight/ Permitting him to doo, what he lusteth to assaye. Oh/what a number of Greefes, hath he suckt, to his decaye: Liueing after his Pleasure, in Good-thinkings vayne Race: And is Also vtterly Gen. 4.[illeg.]. vnfaythfull, in all what he maye. For one doth wrong another, Ier. 9. with Crafty-gyle, apace. Oh/sore to be lamented, is the Mans vnrestfull Case. Those that now seeke Peace, are counted Wicked, in Errour wandring. And of the Loue, ther is no Mencion heard in any place. Oh! When shall the Man, becom Understanding? O eternall Prince, God almighty Father-on-hy! Prince To thee only must it be, complayned vehemently, That the Man is thus falne, into so many Infirmityes: And yet not once myndfull, nor wil thesame espy, That hee, from his God, Gen. 3. Esa. [illeg.].a. 59. is departed in such-wyse. Declyned from the louely Trueth, and bent to follow Lyes. He hath take vpon him, an High-mynde to entertayne: Quyte reiecting Playne-and-iust, in this his Enterprise. Oh! that the Man mought now, turne to his God agayne/ That same shoulde him iustify, from Sinne that so doth raigne: Walking playne and iust, worthy of Commending: So mought he then liue, without all Feare or Payne. Oh! when shall the Man, becom Understanding? The Ende of the Refraine. C Oh! that he coulde rightly, reade the Scripture, for his learning/ And discerned the Euell, wherto he doth so cleaue: And ? wherto God created him; did likewyse perceaue. Yet speaketh Lamentacion. And so then had a Lust ? with all his Hearts intent; To learne ? in humble maner; to stande obedient, Toward Gods liueing Woord, as his Cleernes doth requyre: And euenso Gods Trueth, did knowe, and still desyer/ Then were he Iohn [illeg.]. Rom. 6.c. set-free, from all the Deuils Bands. And Peace should-ther bee, likewyse in all Lands. For ? by Gods Understanding; were then all Gouernment. O eternall Wisdom/O heauenly Gyant omnipotent/ Make knowen now vnto mee (like a Prouident discerner) Wherfore the Man hath thus, Deut. 32. Esa 1.a. Ier. 2.c. reiected his Preseruer/ And also his Saluacion ? that heauenly ioyfull Crowne; For Men may playnly see, in eury Citee and Towne/ Nothing-els byt Ignorance, to haue the Dominashon. Also, the Man is Unregarding, in Tryumphing-fashon: And Good-thinking hath likewyse, captiud his Heart ful-strong. So that after Gods Trueth, he doth not rightly long. Oh/Pinching-pangs, this Sorrow breaks my Hart. Oh! that it mought now, chance to me for my part That God woulde rayse-vp, the Understanding, vnto mee: And cleerly discouer, the Trueth, that I mought see, Wherfore the Man remayneth, thus plaged euery-waye: For the Mans Calamitee, doth much my Heart dismaye. And I am throwly greeued, euen inwardly, therfore. The X. Chapter. A Understanding. Be comforted ? thou Lamenter; and vex thy mynde nomore. For though thou searchest much, it shall not thee avayle: For y? Man hath forsaken, both God &amp; his Counsayle/ Through the Gen. 3.a. Knowledg, so greatly exercised/ Which ? by his owne Mocion; he hath enterprised: Agaynst the Comaundement of God, who liueth in eternytee. Therfore is he alwayes, Esa. 5.c. Ier. 5.a. 7.c 4. Esd. 7.c. 8.f. Resisting verylee, The true Obedience, requyred by his Woord: And woulde likewyse ? with his Speaches most-absurd; That his owne knowing Wisdom, in place of Gods mought stande. But so long now as the Man, is not Math. 16. got-out of that Bande Of his Owne-wisdom/he doth in Errour byde. And from the Grace of God, Eph. 2. 4.b. is seperated wyde. For, how wyse soeuer the Man ? in his Purchase; is bocom/ Yet must he first of all, dye from his owne Wisdom/ Ere that he ? the Understanding, 1. Cor. 2. of God; can com-by. Therfore his owne Wisdom, must he forsake and fly, Confessing before God, Psal. 13.a. Rom. 3.a. to haue no Understanding, a right: Nor to know wheare God worketh, with his Hande of Might. Nor yet can comprehende, Sap. 9.c. Rom. 11.d. Gods Works in their Degree. Lamentacion. Oh! this same now can the Man, in nowyse rightly see/ Because that his Longing, to the Knowledg is inclyned. For each-one cometh-forth, with what he hath gott and guyned Through his owne Good-thinking/so farr as I can fynde: For the Man can not otherwyse, conceaue it in his Mynde, But that y? Knowledg ? through Searching; must becom learned. B Understanding. Therfore also his Heart, quit away-is turned From God/to the High Wisdom, of Mans owne Industery. For so long as the Man, bydeth deafe heerin vtterly/ And wil not stande submitted ? in God; obediently: Neither yet forsaketh, his owne Comodity: Nor also the Knowledg, with all her Stock and Broode/ So wil not God likewyse, giue ? into him; his Foode. For God ? in true Knowledg; is only wyse, no dout[illeg.] No man, can Gods Wisdom, declare or measure-out: For God doth keepe his Wisdom, Math. 11. 13. secret ? as is fitt; From all the Careful-study, of Mans Ingenious-witt. For when y? Man seeketh after Gods Misteryes that are hidden, Through the meane of Knowledg, which is to him forbidden/ Wherby to becom like Gen. 3. God, in Understanding excelent/ So then likewyse ? being proude in his Heart, and impudent; He ? most arrogantly; into Gods Work doth thrust. Also then iniuryously, suppresteth Playne-and-iust: And so ? in Gods Wisdom; a very 1. Cor. 1.[illeg.]. Foole is founde. C Lamentacion. Oh! Now is the Trueth to mee, opened from the grounde: But dispise not yet I praye thee, my farder Comunicacien: For I am still much greeued, in my Cogitacion. Therfore I must yet aske thee, with Woords of great Feruency: Wherfore doth the Man, liue thus extreeme vnquyetly? How cometh it to pas/that he feeleth not his Misery? For whersoeuer I turne me (to tell thee now the Uerety) I fynde no Oze. 4.a. Mat. 24.b. Loue at-all, I must it needes disclose: But Mocking and Deryding, euery-wheare now floes/ Also Curssing, Swearing, Lying, and Reuyling/ Hatred or Enuy, and Math. 24. 1. Cor 6.b. Ephe. 5.a. Gal. 5.b. Falshod with Begyling/ Hipocricie, Sects, and Dissencion, out of-measure/ Uiolence, and Crueltie, voyde of Ioye or Pleasure/ Ambition, Oppression, with Deuouring ful sore/ Also high Wisdom, and New-inuencious, store/ With much Contending, Arguing, and Disputing/ Much Searching, Tim. 1.a. 4.b. 6.c. 2. Tim. 2.a. Demanding, and reprochfull Confuting/ Much Babling, Betraing, and Witnissing-vnright. The Simplicitee must ? euery-wheare; bow vnder quyt: Pryde, and Lightmyndednes, are also in Request/ Blaspheaming, and Persecuting/this causeth much Unrest: Warr, Battell, and Rebellyon: who can the same now byde? The Learned are at Discorde, and themselues in Parts deuyde: Ther are likwyse Many, towards another, fiersly bent: And to the Requyring of Gods Woorde, are disobedient. The Subiects do their Rulers, 2. Tim. 1. 4.a. resist and dispise. And the Scholers, their masters Doctrine, likewyse. Ther is no wheare true Concorde, but fayned Disscimulashon. Now when I in my Heart, had all this in considerashon/ Then desyred I gladly, to haue som Information: Wherfore the Man doth liue, thus voyde of Edification. What is the cause he knoweth it not? tell me I thee praye. Wherfore doth he choose the thing, that greeueth him alwaye: And not that which is the Louelyest, and the very Best? D Understanding. This doth not the Man, comprehend, Ier. 30. Infra. 17.b till at the last/ When as he, with willing Obedience (mark what I resite) Is inclynd to the Seruice of Loue, with all his hearts Delyte: And so ? through the Seruice of Loue, 1. Col. 13.b. that euermore doth last; To the vertuous Will of his God, Ioh. 15.a. is incorporated fast. For being without Gods Wil, in Self-lust he leads his Lyfe/ Seekeing only his owne Will, with much Unrest and Strife. And so long as he therin, Rom. 7.b. captured doth remayne/ He shall not any Loue, neither Peace, obtayne. For his Owne-will, doth wholly him begyle/ And his taken-on Knowledg, doth him Ier. 8.a. with Lyes ? defyle. All Aduisement, doth Unregarding, awaye from him now take/ And his owne Good-thinking, doth him contencious make: His Highmyndednes, Esa. 14.b. make him, rebellyous stout and bolde. Euen thus then the Man, in the Loue becometh colde. And then both Loue and Peace, [illeg.] Tess. 2.b. he doth vtterly abhorr/ Reiecting that which is playne. E Lamentacion. Oh, therfore hath the Man, to wayt duly for All Mishapp Esa. 13.[illeg.] 34.a. 47.b. and Calamitee, in his Gayne, he hath imbraste. Oh! who shall cause the Man, Understanding, for to taste/ That mought release him, Esa. 1.a. from his greuous Smart? Understanding. If eueryone woulde enter, into his owne Heart/ And dealt in sucht-sort, Eccl. 31. b Tob. 4 b. Math. 7 b. Luk 6. d. as he woulde be dealt withall: If Loue and Peace were sought, both of Great and Small: And woulde eueryone becom, Math. 20. Mar. 10.c. Luk. 22.c. the Least, and not the Cheefe: Then shoulde the Man right-soone, be cured of his Greefe. His Loue shoulde also bee, like a Fyer that is glowing: And God Ioel. 2.c. Act. 2.b. shoulde then likewyse ? with his Grace, ouerflowing; Be working in the Man/as Hee was wont to doo. Lamentacion. O God Father/vouch safe to strenghten vs thertoo: For, to that ende wil we go proffer ourselues vnto the Man/ To see if his Heart therto, stirr-vpp or mooue we can/ With the holy Scripture, which thou doest witnes playne: That happly he ? by thar meanes; mought vet once agayne Suck the right Ioh. 17.a.

Tusch, no/the Wisdom of Man, is but a Tryfle, in effect/ How glistering holy, soeuer it doth appeere: For, tis all before God, Esa. 1.c. but filthy stinking-geere, If they in their Hearts, humble be not founde/ Nor shewe-foorth any Loue, wherin they shoulde abounde/ As to be long suffering, and vnreuengfull also: For those that be contencious, breake the Peace wheare they got Reiecting 1. Tim. 3.a. [illeg.] Pe[illeg.]. 2.a. y? right Doctrine, that to y? Loues Worke, doth serue. Disobedient, as those, that from Christs Church, fall and swarue[illeg.] And in all their Dealings, are puft-vp in Ambition. Also those that seeke themselues, in eury Condition/ Those that in their Gouernment, wil no body forbeare/ Nor suffer any but such, as them do please and feare. Those that account the Humilitee, to be of no Estimashon All These that take-in-hande, the Scripture after this fashon/ To them must [illeg.] seeme to be loueing, with a freendly Cheere[illeg.] For to them are we acceptable, and esteemed-of ful-deers. But yet (to begin-withall) I must first chaunge my Name/ Then can none bring me vnder, nor worke me any Shame. But I shall deceaue them all ? in their Lyfe; without fayle. Unregarding. How wilt thou name thyself? D Good-thinking. The Spirits Inspiring/so shall I best preuayle: For the Man maketh doutles, no Difference or Destintting, Betwixt the true Spirit, and the Worke of Goodthinking. Thus doth the Man ? as-yet; our owne Kernell safe remayne. Unregarding. O ? deere Cosen; such a Name, woulde I haue veryfayne: Tell me I beseeche thee, wilt thou now leaue my Company? Good-thinking. O no in any-wyse, but with me euen mutually, Must thou ? by som holy thing; be named in like-ease. So then ? as it is meete; we byde together in euery place: And shall euenso then, reioyce the Man most-cheefly. Unregarding. Yea/how shall I be called? E Good-thinking. The free Spirit/I saye breefly: Which must boldly without feare, count himself holy and pure. So shall we Two no dout ? with Auctoritee; then be sure All Man ? in their Understanding; to deceaue and leade awrye. For once, the Spirits Inspiring, may in nowyse lye: And the free Spirit, can by no meanes sinne. To publish this vnto them all, we wil now beginne. And heerunto shall we Twayne, serue well together then. Unregarding. Uerely ? my gentle Cosen; therto I saye, Amen. Now me thinks thou speakest, the Trueth to good effect/ Thus byde I still with thee, do not me reiect. For I hope we shall brew Wonderful matter yet. The XIIII. Chapter. A Good-thinking. We Two (I warrant thee) wil not faynt-a-whitt. For as they call mee now, Thinspiring of the holy Goste/ So do those worke great Wonders, that highly do them boste: And thee, to be the Spirit, that perfect is and free/ We shalbe Both accounted now, Unspotted ones to bee/ Euen as those which fall not into any naughty Sinne. Unregarding. Hah-hah-ha/That is a fyne Remedy, &amp; cuningly brought in/ As heere it doth appere now, for our Purpose passing-right. O-ho! This shalbe to many Men, a Comfort and Delighte, Which, to the Loue of Righteousnes, haue no good regarde: Good-thinking. Namely: To the Couetous, that seeke Gifts or Rewarde. And go to teache the Scripture, for Esa. 5.[illeg.] Exec. 13.b. 34. Mich. [illeg.]. fylthy Gayne &amp; Treasure/ Because they woulde liue ydly, after their owne Mynds pleasure/ Also all, that flatter Exe. 34.b. the feeble Sheepe, from the right Foulde. Those that ? with Compulcion; wil the Conscience captiue[illeg.]oulde. Also those that do endeuour them, with great Desyer-of-mynde, In their manly Knowledg, Gods Trueth to gett or fynde. All, which perswade themselues, that they are Tim. 1.a. throwly-learned, And ? after their owne Knowledg; wil liue Rom. 1.b. 2. Pet. 2.b. [illeg.].b. free and vnbrydled. Also all, that do themselues, on their owne Knowledg grounde/ And with their false venemous Mouthes ? mischeuous of Sounde; The Entrance into the Christian Beeing, do withstande &amp; refuse. As likewyse all Disobedient ones, that much Reading do vse/ And which ? after their owne Knowledg; themselues do still teache/ Turning thatt Doctrine to the worst, which the Loue doth preache. Yea, and those, which the Scripture; like a Topp; 2. Pet. 3.b. about do [illeg.]wle. O! We haue yet many more, contayned in our Scrowle/ Which after the Spirits-inspiring, by Good-thinking, do liue. B Unregarding. And to me Unregarding, then high Exaltacion giue: For I am the Free-spirit, as I by thee do heare. Eueryone may now deale, like a Foole, and neede not feare/ Re[illeg.]eing with Unregarding, in his Forest that is so wyde: And fa[illeg.]e: with the free Spirit, then may no Sinne abyde. For no man, to accuse vs, da[illeg.]e once be so bolde. Whose likewyse ? after our Mynde; with vs wil not holde/ But shall speake against vs, and saye that we proceede, In the fal[illeg.]e Freedom/and haue not ? as we reede; Performed the Obedience, to the Gayning of the Loue/ Yea, though of the Loues Family, or Howsholde then shoulde proue/ Towards them, we wil showe, no Loue nor Freendly-cheere. Good-thinking. If any man blaspheame vs, himself he may not cleere/ In the same flourishing tyme, wherin wee thus do rayne. It shall also now fal out, to nomans ease nor gayne, That wil openly dispise vs, and seeme on vs to lower: For we Two [illeg.] now, gotten vs mighty Power/ Through those People Apo. 18.b. that serue vs, in our Affayres that we doo. Yea, all the Worlde doth showe, loueing Freendship to vs Two For she doth ernestly her owne, both Ioh. 15.b. loue and cate ensue. Unregarding. Thatt is now well seene and knowen, that it is very-true: For the most Number are mynded, with Us, euery wheare. Good-thinking. Are they not almost all now, gotten into our Snare? Who is-ther now ? I praye you; left without our Bandes? Are not wee esteemed, for the Cheefest, in all Landes? They com to great Reproche, that against vs rebell. C Unregarding. All this ? my deere Cosen; we now perceaue right-well. But we must go speedely, and follow our worthy Arte: That we be not any-more, so feared in our Heart: Spare not anyone, wherseuer thou comst-in-place, With thy Good-thinking/but spread it theare a pace. Practise now Subtiltee/and New-inuentions frame: That we be no more put-downe, nor brought to any Shame. Therfore now in Arguing, make Discorde and Debate/ Through thy Spirits Inspiring, with Disputing and with Prate. Flourish-out thy Woords now, with smooth and gallant Phrase: That the Grounde af the Trueth, be not knowen in any-case. And I Unregarding, wil them well to mee allure. Good-thinking. Gowe then together, we wil so temper it to procure, That they shall very well disgest our Gobbetts euery bitt: For to vs, this kynde of Dealing, cannot be teadious a whitt. We wil now go streaw abrode, our Uenom in eury Wynde: That we may by that meanes, deuour all what we fynde. Unregarding. We shall blynde &amp; catch them all. We need not to dout it/ We Two together, match them shall. Therfore gowe about it. Pavsa IIII. The XV. Chapter. Conclvsion. A Longing-for-comfort. Oh/wonderfull Things, haue I now hearde heere vttered! O Good-informacion, therof instruct thou mee. Good-information. O Longing-for-comfort, wherin art thou yet combered: Longing-for-comfort. Oh/wonderfull Things, haue I now hearde heere vttered? Good-information. Let not thy Heart ? therwith; be anything distempered/ Ther is no wonderfull thing, I must disclose to thee. Longing-for-comfort. Oh/wonderful Things, howe I now heard heere vttered: O Good-informacion, therof instruct thou mee. And vnto me declare now, the D[illeg.]st of thissame Playe. Good-information. Let the Knowledg not to-much delyte thy Mynde I saye: That thou com not into much Unrestfulnes therby. Longing-for-comfort. I hope well, No: For with a good Desyre woulde I Uery-gladly now ? at large; euen simply knowe/ The Mynde of thissame Playe, if mee thou wouldst it showe: And only thatt, to my Desyre, as I do heere declare. B Good-information. O longing-for-comfort, thatt is a good Intent and Care: For Understanding is gotten, after such a Fashon. But yet ther doth great Perrill, consist in Informashon: Because many false Praters, are start-vp and beare swaye/ Which prate and report much, against the Loue, alwaye/ And also in that sort, their false Informations do sowe: And satisfy ? with Falshold; the Demaunders High and Lowe/ Euen for a Exe. 13.b. Mich. 3.b. peece of Bread/or a Handfull of Barly-grayne. Longing-for-comfort. Oh/wo is mee: To heare that, my Heart wil brake with payne? Are-ther now in these Dayes, such Praters to be founde? C Good-information. Thatt may you well perceaue, by their Discords that abounde: As likewyse by their Renting, Dissencion, and Deceate. Longing-for-comfort. This new passed-ouer: instruct me I thee intreate/ Of the Kynde of this Playe, that I may reioyce me than. The XVI. Chapter. A Good-information. That is/that Playne-and-iust, hath God created Man/ To thend he shoulde serue Him, in all vpright Gen. [illeg.] Righteousnes/ To liue therin for euer, in Ioye and sweete Delightfulnes: As likewyse, in all Loue, and reasonable Nature/ In Gods true Obedience, as Gods very Figure: Cleaueing to the Trueth, that to the Lyfe doth all men gode. And that is Gods Kingdom, voyde of Trembling &amp; of Pryde/ Which God hath geeuen, Luk. [illeg.] into the Mans Hart/ When from he hath turned, to his greeuous Smart. All which this Playe doth showe you (if it be wel regarded) As also the Mans Wickednes, wherwith he is rewarded/ To sing as he, without Gods Kingdom, wandring doth remayne. Thus marke y? Mynde, that is to thee, rehearsed breef Math. [illeg.]. Mat. 1.a. Luk. 1.a. 24. Act. 3. 4. [illeg.]. &amp; playne, And [illeg.] repent thee for tho Synnes, to thy Iustification: To thend that thou mayst com, in right Humiliacion To the Kingdom of God, full of all Loue so meeke/ Fill of Ioye, Ro. 14.b. full of Lyfe and full of Concord e[illeg.]e: Full of Trueth of Righteousnes, and of Peace too. Thus do thou still as thou wouldst, To[illeg.]. 4.b. Math. 7.b. that men to thee should doe: For to the Entrance into the Kingdom, thats the only Waye. B Longing-for-comfort. O Good informacion, I thanke thee what I maye, Both for thy good Instruction, and fruitfull Exhortation. But while we stande yet heere, together in Communicacion, Somwhat more I must yet afte thee, euen bolde and ernestly: Is it possible I pray thee, such great Deceite to occupy, And so many wyly Snares, to laye in such a sort, As this Playe hath now heer, made to vs Report, Through Unregarding and Good thinkings Spirit or Goste? Good-informacion. O Yea no dout: and they can deceaue them moste, Which seeme to be both 2. Tim. 3.a. 2. Pe[illeg.]. 2.b. wyse, and honorable also/ Lykewyse, the Highmynded and Enuyous, a[illeg.]o/ As also many Simpleones, with their crafty Suttletyes. Euen thus they bring Men dayly, into many Miseryes: And likewyse into Dissencion, one-another much disdayning/ Into Hatrid or Enuy, so that Pryde in them is raigning: Thee [illeg.] Tess. 2.b. Loue, and her Righteousnes, euen altogether comtemning. Longing-for-comfort. This perceaue I well now, after my simple Comprehending. But yet one Poynt more, ful gladly know I woulde. Good-informacion. What Poynt is thatt? C Longing-for-comfort. I harde, that Unregarding, and Good-thinking, shoulde Boldly presume ? with their suttle Snares or wyly Slights; To seduce all sort, of People, with pleasant vayne Delights: Also the Great knowers, in all what they deuise/ The Scriptur-leared-sort, and the worldly wyse: And woulde bring them all into Errour, such was their Intent. How shall I vnderstande thatt, I praye thee? Good-informacion. Consider of the Mynde, that this Playe doth heere present. And I wil name them to thee ? whom they deceaue; by and-by. Longing-for-comfort Yea/who be they? Good-informacion. The Supposeing-true-sayers, that Ier. 8.a. 23.a. 27.b. Ezec. 13.a. 14.a 34.a. Mich. 3. euermore do lye: All those that are largly, clothed with Self-will: All, which cruell Enuy, do vtter from them still: Those/that ? by false Deuices; the name wil seeme to haue/ That they haue fild themselues, full of Wisdom graue. Who are also rightly rehearst, by Good-thinking a fore sayde. All those likewyse that bost them: they are free, it is all payde: And so choose to heare counterfeit Teachers, to follow after Sitch/ After whose deceitfull Doctrine/ Tim. 4.a. their Eares do dayly itch: Also all, that from the Doctrine of the Loue are turned. Likewyse all corrupt Heartes, of the Scripture-learned: All those that with Anger, from their Elder do depart/ And his Doctrine of Loue ? to y? worst; do spred and peruert. Also all, that are 2. Pet. 2.b. ludæ. 1.b. turned, to such Falshod, very naught/ And suppose ? in such a Standing; of God for to be taught/ And wil not be touched, by the seruiceable Worde/ Wherby to learne to taste, the Loue, and her Accorde/ Wher-from they are quyt estranged, robbed, and blyndly leadd. All those that haue not Christ, with his Loue, Ephe. 2.b. 5.c. for their Headd/ But are so vtterly deafe, that they ? as the most Nomber; Haste their Course-of lyfe/after the worldly Maner/ And yet thinke they haue the Best, in their Hearts within. D All these false good-thinking Sinagogs ? full of Sinne; Which without Water and Iohn 5. Spirit, byde vnregenerate/ And ? with Falshod; set-foorth/ Esa 32.b. Ier. 7.c. their Good-thinking, to ymitate/ Becom both Soule and Bodye, seduced into Hell/ With all their Like-companions, before rehearsed well: Together with all those, that with such Falshod do aryse/ And ? vnprepared; go to teache, as if that they were wyse/ Who with their fonde Deuices, their Foolishnes bewraye/ And do nothing but ensue, the Distruction, daye-by-daye. Yea, all this vna[illeg.]dly [illeg.]rue, that are puffed-vp on-[illeg.] All that shewe fayer Countenance, with holy Showe to Th[illeg.] And turne them not about, to becom like Math. 1[illeg.] a little Childe/ (To Gods heauenly Kingdom) to be taught end reconcilde: Also all that ? with Dispitfulnes; gainst Anyone wil enuaye: Those which ? against the Loue; force Others to confesse and saye: Another kynde of Fayeth, then their Hearts alow? or Testifye: Those that vex any Conscience, gainst Loue, or christian Charitye: Those that ? with Uiolence; set-forth their Religion, for y? Best: All these are bred &amp; brought, out of Good-thinkings wicked Nest: Though by anyones Extolling, they seeme neuer so wyse to show. E Longing-for-comfort. O Good-informacion/this makes me full of Greef to growe. Be Those accounted euell, which be called wyse and graue/ That seeme likwyse to be so holly/heare yet my Speed I craue: Can the Spirit of Good thinking, intrapp likewyse al such, As are so learned, and so wyse, in [illeg.]ing foorth of much? How shall then the Simple-sort, escape and shune their hande? Good-informacion. Oh/alas the simple-folke, are playne in euery Lande/ They are right like Balaams Nvm. 82. Asse, true it is no dout/ That be dreeuen and directed, heere and theare about: For now among Many, it doth manyfestly appeere/ That ? by Good-thinkings suttle Sleights; both farr and neere Many Peoples Hearts, are troubled greeuously: Also Many ? into Error; are sedust and ledd awry/ With much Heavy-cheere, laden in their Thought: And with greeuous Torments, are to the Slaughter brought: Wherunto many Simpleones, haue prepared themselues redy: The XVII Chapter. A Longing-for-comfort. Oh! my heart cannot reioyce, nor any may be mery, Because that Men thus sitt, in Good-thinkings Generacion. And that one doth worke another, great Wrong and Uexacion. About Knowledg, which they drawe to them boldly, not shrinking: For in that maner/through y? polluted Worke of Good-thinking, Almost all Men ? with Knowledg; are mightely vexed now/ And which Good thinkings Spirit/as each Heart doth gesse and alow. Wherthrough I do note ? by thy Speech, sence thou didst beginne; That they are all deceaued, through their Wicked Sinne: For now, one man easely perceaue, by marking these things/ That Good-thinking hath gotten almost all, vnder his Wings/ Both Lay people and Clerks, in my simple Discerning. But Now I wonder at this ? which I aske thee for my learning; How the Man shall be gloryfyed, with his God agayne: Uouchsafe yet to instruct me therof. B Good-Informacion. Thatt is ? by Understanding; in this Playe, declared playne/ Who doth testify vnto vs ? in perfect Cleernes; theare That so long as the Man, doth suck and still prepare, The Taking-on of Gen. 3. Rom. 5. Adam, in his Wandring-out-astraye He remayneth alwayes, departed farr-awaye From Gods Understanding, heere on Earth, in wretched case? Till he leaue or put-of Adam, and put on Rom. [illeg.].a. 13. 1. Cor. 15.[illeg.]. E[illeg.]he. 4.c. Col. 3.a. Christ, in his place/ And, from all his Self-wisdom, desyreth to convart. Longing-for-comfort. But if the Man woulde learne, to be simple, for his part/ And woulde walke after Chist, in his Obedince true: And deale towards Eueryone, vprightly, as is due; And [illeg.] Equitee, woulde doo the best he might: How shoulde it go with him then? Good-Information. Thatt shall he at the Sup. 10.c. d. last, vnderstande Ier. 30.d. that he is mard or defuled: And to the Loues Obedience, hath turned him and inclyned. And so is entered, into the holy Seruice of Loue/ Lyke as Understanding, doth confesse and approue/ Through the Lamentacion that for the Man was made. C Longing-for-comfort. [illeg.]ow wil I leaue Demaunding, and no f[illeg.] made: For I beginne greatly, heerof to be afrayd, That it muse all Gen. 3.b. Esa. 14.b. com, and on the Man be layde, Which [illeg.] indeed [illeg.] him, in his disobedient Straying: For God ? often his Fall; pronounced-foorth this Saying/ That daily shoulde him meete, all Wretchednes and Misery. Good-informacion. Heerwith, wee wish you All, good Health and Prosperety: Craueing-leaue (Dearly-beloued) from hence now to depart. Longing-for-comfort. Receaue thissame in Loue, to your Solace and Comodety. Good-Information. Heer-with, we wish you All, good Health and Prosperety. Longing-for-comfort. Chainge your Sorow into Ioye, in the Loue of the Uerety/ With this our playne Inuencion, shewing small skill of Arte. Good-informacion. Heer-with, we wish you All, good Health and Prosperety: Craueing-leaue (Deerly-beloued) from hence now to depart, Yee wyse-mynded People, take this Matter well to hart. FINIS.</field>
