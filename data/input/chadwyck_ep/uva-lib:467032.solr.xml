To ye, fair maids, whose sorrow-tears will flow When conning o'er an artless tale of woe, Who wept with unfeigned grief for Charlotte's doom âIn the first canto of the following little Poem I have endeavoured to express my feelings for the lamented death of the Princess Charlotte, and also have endeavoured to portray those of Prince Leopold, personages who, by their splendid virtues, would have adorned equally a cottage or a palace. In the second canto, I have equally, and with the same candour, expressed my feelings; if any warped my judgment, I must beg pardon, but the duty of the Poet is to âhold the mirror up to nature,â and I do not think that my pen has been led much astray. The public will judge, and I trust with candour, and to its verdict I now submitââPreface by the Author. (A lovely victim in an early tomb), Who bless her memory, and will ne'er forget That Brunswick's Star is now for ever set: What though my hand strays feebly o'er each string, Oh! deign to hear my harp's sad murmuring; Then listen to the sounds of woe and pain,â To ye I dedicate this slow and mournful strain. I The Star of Brunswick's quenched in endless nightâ The ray of glory's vanished from the heaven; Though erst it streamed in radiant lustre bright, A sparkling beauty in the mildest even! But far behind the blackest clouds 'tis driven, Shrouded in darkness, hid from mortal eyes, Yet, when yon azure firmament is riven, It then in tenfold lustre shall ariseâ Brunswick's bright Star hid only for a season lies. II Charlotte! the lines of virtue in thy face Were writ so legible by God's own hand, That not a mortal breathing but could trace Thy deeds, woe soothing, generous and grand: Thou truly wert the noblest in the land, (If virtue is accounted noble now), For thou with wisdom travelled hand-in-hand; Thy title could not grace thee here, but thou Gave lustre to the coronet that clasped thy brow. III Fondly we gazed upon the nation's gem (A brighter one ne'er graced Golconda's mine). And ardent hoped Britannia's Diadem Would round thy brows for many years entwine: Thou wert the rising hope of all thy line, The Nation's glory, Britain's Darling Child; But oh! thy virtues, charms, were all too fine, Thy feeling heart too tender and too mild, To dwell in such a world, so stormy and so wild. IV Who would have thought upon a scene like this, When thou wert cradled on thy mother's knee; And marking thee through joys of youth and bliss, Thy people such a sad reverse should see? With holy raptures and true honest glee, They'd vowed allegiance to such worth as thine; Under thy sway the proud Isle of the Sea Would certes lovelier beamed in splendour fine, E'en though its glories now with such bright lustre shine. V Anticipation! thou art fled for ever, And the bright retrospect is all we find: As when proud Britain's fleet the billows sever, They leave a short but brilliant track behind. Yet on such traces we may surely bind The loveliest hope-flower that on earth e'er grew, And wail that such a bud should be entwined With the dark ringlets of the deadly yew, For its expanding days were lovely but were few. VI Charlotte! when hovering on the verge of time, And every hope was flitting quickly past; Fading so sudden in thy opening prime, Ne'er was the splendour of thy soul o'ercast: While death stood byâwhile life itself did last, Thou blessed thy Leopold with many a sigh, With death-locked hands, thou clasped thy husband's fast, And when speech was gone, thy speaking eye Said, âSee with what calm peace a Christian can die.â VII âTell, tell my Leopold,â the Princess said, Ere yet the damp of death sat on her brow, âTell him, from me, his spirits must not fade, For I'm the happiest wife in England now.â Thus, the sweet sufferer, that he might not bow In sorrow, uttered her love accents mild, Soothing her partner that no tears might flow For her keen pangs, and keener yet, and wild, When to her Britain's heir appeared a lifeless child. VIII Matrons of Britain, copy her pure mind, Be ye like her, and all her paths revere; And ye, fair maidens, never will ye find A mark more true, to guide your actions here; Wail, wail her loss with many a heart-wrung tear, An early blighted and a lovely flower; And if ye in her footsteps persevere, They'll aid ye sweetly in your dying hour, Fear, on the death couch, will be stript of all his power. IX The scene is finished, and the curtain closed; Thus, many a cheerful prospect ends in woe; The proudest structure where our hopes reposed, May soon be dashed down by a fearful blow: So lately every hope, with fervid glow, Rose rapid, rapid, with increased delight; But soon the lovely fabric was laid low, And vanished sudden from our eager sight, Wrapt in the dreary whirlwinds and the storms of night. X And thou, high Scion of the stranger land, Say, to what home of peace canst thou now hie; She bound thee here, with love's own silken band, And was thine ownâthe apple of thine eye: Say, where on earth must thou for solace fly? From thee, the calm of soul was harshly driven. To Claremont goâremembrance will rush by, For the calm sunshine of a cloudless heaven Is changed to all the horrors of a stormy even! XI Oh! she was thine, thou loved her as thy soul, And she returned thy tenderness and care; Far round might ruin and destruction rollâ View Claremont, truest happiness was there. Like Eden's garden, it was spotless fair, Where ne'er a serpent entered, well I wis; As our first parents, they did rapture share, Ere they were driven from the bowers of bliss, And took the last farewell of their own paradise. XII Through the short calm of sweet connubial love, Retired from princely grandeur, pompous noise, With wild ambition ye would never rove, But dwelt with her who was thy only choice: Ye tasted exquisitely the thrilling joys, Which through the souls of faithful lovers swim: But there's a counteracting power employs Mysterious ways, which to us cruel seem, And, Leopold, thy bliss was as a transient dream! XIII When kneeling down beside the bed of death, My God! how trembled thy high spirit then! Ne'er so before, ne'er trembled thy full breath, When standing nobly 'mid the shock of men: And though in heat of battle placed again, With sword in hand engaged in martial strife, Though stretched in agony amid the slain, And felt the deadly throes of ebbing lifeâ Those pangs are nought compared to parting with thy wife. XIV Descending to the mansions of the dead, Thou poured thy sorrows to the midnight air; And where the reliques of thy love were laid, Thou stoodst the living image of despair! That form before thee late so sweet and fair, Deprived of motion, and bereft of breath. The scene was striking! Oh, that love is rare, Full of attachment, and the purest faith, That pours its griefs e'en in the sleeping room of death! XV Thou'st won the love of every British heart, They've tried to cheer thee in affliction's hour; But difficult the task is to impart Strength to the bruised reed or broken flower; Kings may sink down, and princes' fortunes lower (But God forbid there should be new alarms); If thou wert stript of titles, wealth, and power, I'd then approach (thy worth my bosom warms), And as a friend, a brother, clasp thee in my arms. XVI He who hath aimed the blow alone can heal, And He will not forsake thee, Princely One: And that loved angel will watch o'er thy weal, Who hath so lately from thy presence gone. And when in Claremont thou remain'st alone, Thou'lt o'er departed pleasures sadly brood; Yet that will give thy soul a calmer toneâ Like Charlotte, be the first in doing good, And that will soothe thee in thy lonely solitude. XVII Farewell, my Prince, may time roll calmly past, 'Till grief is mellowed by revolving years; For neither mortal woes, nor pleasures last, And human hopes are dashed by human fears; When thy last step hath pressed this vale of tears, Where thou hast seen thy hopes to ruin driven, Amid the burst of light, from other spheres, Oh! may a happy welcome then be given, By her who is before thee in the bowers of heaven! CANTO II. I Unfit am I to wound a British soul, Unfit am I to trace ignoble deeds; Yet albeit I mote well unveil the whole, Though certes whilomwhile my bosom bleeds: And who this sad and rueful story reads, Deigns to refuse a sigh, a pitying tear, Or shroud himself, I wot, in sable weeds; For Charlotte was to every Briton dearâ Her worth was known, and sweetly dwelt on here. II Oh! may that day be never known in heaven, When high-born souls were separated, disjoinedâ May the âRecording Angel'sâ leaf be riven, Or else by some sweet seraph interlined! And well I wis, that seraph sure may find Some smooth excuse that to us is unknown; A Prince's love is cold as northern windâ But Providence will soothe that mother lone, Who mourns her daughter's fate, and sadly weeps her own. III I'm not beholden to a great man's power, And reckless am I of the courtly band, The heaviest malisons may on me showerâ In Scottish phrase, I'll tell my tale aff hand; Shame! shame! the highest head in all the land, To bow so lowly in life's gloaming hourâ To spurn his better half was noble, grand! Mayhap it was to please his princely power, Mayhap to gratify some haughty paramour! IV Thus far I ventureâI will not recedeâ A Scottish spirit was, and shall be freeâ But oh! my Prince, our mountain bosoms bleed, Though erst attuned to merriment and glee: The nation's glory driven across the sea, Thy bosom-partner through the world to roam! Princess! an houseless wanderer thou canst be, But what was stately palace, princely dome, When thou wert far away from thy loved daughter's home? V Say, did the climes of Italy suffice To calm thy soul when Charlotte was not by? Could balmy gales, from where the myrtles rise, Sweep the still tear-drop from thy lovely eye? Methinks I hear that sad heart-rending cry, When the rude messenger proclaimed the death Of her thou lovedstâand not behold her die; Or hear those sentiments of purest faith; Or fold her in thy arms, and catch her parting breath. VI Though not unskilled in courtly lore, I must Probe the deep gangrene of my country's wound. Where, where, I say, in vilest living dust, Could such cold-hearted apathy be found? Not one relation was there seen around The bed of death, save Leopold alone; The Royal Uncles, with high feasting crowned, Sat reckless of the heirship to the crown, Although each goodly prospect might be overthrown. VII Peace be to thee, my good, my worthy king (A shattered fragment of the olden school), My Northern breast must still be murmuring, When Southern chiefs spend time in sad misrule. Deem not the indignant Bard, ye Chiefs, a fool, Though in the world's broad path he's marked as such, If willing he, some nobles would cry dool, And writhe themselves beneath satiric clutch, He'd wield Uriel's spearâexpose them at the touch. VIII Charlotte was thine, thou lovedst her, Farmer George, Humble the title, but it was thine own; Kings may take titlesâkings may titles forge, But mote, I say, thou well became thy throne: Thy peaceful, rural attributes are goneâ A lonely stranger in thy lovely land! But thou for nigh a century hath won Thy lieges' love, for mild was thy command: The sceptre never graced a truer, nobler hand. IX Where was the highest female in the land? Where was the grandame in the trying hour? Was it Apollion's, or God's command, That bade her speed her way on such a tour? Say, say, could eild grace festive hall or bower, Or catch the joy-glance of a youthful eye, While Britain's sweets were mingled with the sour? It was a scene whereat I might say, Fye! Muse on a lonely death-bed, wring my hands, and sigh! X Grandames are wont in our cold Northern clime, In place of fleeing (as it were) from harms, To spare no hardship, no fatigue, no time, To fly and catch the cherub in their arms: Each aged heart with youthful pleasure warms, They crack fu' couthily on promised bliss; But Southern dames are cold to infant charms, Else the great matron of our land, I wis, Would ne'er give an example, cruel, such as this! XI Indignant bursts the Spirit of the North, His trembling hand points to a misty cloud, Noble his words, if I dare call them forth; But what he breathed mote not be spoke aloud; It was about a strange Egyptian shroud, Wrapt round my Princess, hurried rapidly; But wild ideas on my senses crowdâ I am confused; and yet I can't tell why, For 'tis strangeâa deep hid mystery. XII A mountain heart throbs wild within its plaid, And darts on yonder cloud his eagle eyes; With manly step, short breath, and lofty head, He trims his bonnet in a warlike guise; And yet the cloud still hovers in the skies, Although the Chieftain such a proud look wore! He knows a foe behind the curtain lies, Albeit he mote not eye his shield before, He throws the gauntlet down, unsheathes his gude claymore. XIII Sheathe, sheathe thy sword, my Highland Chief, my brother, It will be broken, or my chieftain fall; I grant, I grant that never such another, Could from its scabbard thy bright claymore call; I know thou'dst thrown thy gauntlet to allâ But rest ye, rest ye on thy lovely isle, Forbear from Highland feud, from Highland brawl, Put up thy claymore, Chieftain, whilomwhile, And smileâbut well I know 'twill be a ghastly smile! XIV What now avails the deadliest human strife?â The race is over and the goal is won; Oh! could that call the angel back to life, How many swords would glitter in the sun! Sweet innocent! thy race indeed is run, And short but brilliant was thy swift career, For it was ended e'er 'twas well begunâ Yet distant ages will bewail thee here, And blend with Charlotte's name the heart-felt sigh and tear. XV Poetic spirit! let no minstrel breathe Unhallowed accents o'er this tale of woe; Oh! bid them bind their temples with a wreath Of cypress, that the world their grief may know; And cause their verse mellifluent to flow For Charlotte and for Leopold alone; Inspire each lofty British Bard to show That the departed angel was their own; For never purer gem could have adorned our Throne. XVI The wild bird's artless strain is closed, and now He wings his flight to yonder dark yew-tree; Emblem of death! he'll perch upon thy bough, And never more trill cheerful melody; Mute, mute is all his merriment and glee, On which his cheerful notes oft used to dwell; But off this sombre bower he'll never flee, His heart is bursting with a parting swell, It soon will cease to beatâand now a last farewell. ELEGY. Britannia! tear thy laurel leaf, Untwine it frae thy bonny brow; Filled is the measure o' thy grief, Nae splendour will become thee now: Bind on thy temples wreathes o' rue, And mournful rest on Charlotte's tomb; Bid Windsor Palace wave wi' yew, And ceaseless wail her early doom. Blest wi' the husband o' thy choice, Sweet Charlotte! happiness was thine; Life then to thee was fu' o' joys, A foretaste o' the bliss divine: But Fate! why bind the eglantine Wi' the dark blossoms o' the grave? Why, why, the mournfu' wreath entwine, And bid it over Charlotte wave? When lingering on the verge of death, Intent ye gazed upon thy love; Grasped his warm hands to cheer his faith, And never bade thy fond eyes rove: Mildly they beamed and never strove To stray frae him, but gazed their fill; And when in death they ceased to move, They pointed to the husband still. Blest wi' the flush o' beauty's bloom, A nation's pride, a nation's joy; How soon to slumber in the tomb, An' ilka rising hope destroy! Restin' wi' thee's the bonny boy, Who might hae wore the British crown; Lately our hopes met no alloy, But now a nation's glory's flown. Britannia! tear thy laurel leaf, Untwine it frae thy bonny brow; Filled is the measure o' thy grief, Nae splendour will become thee now; Bind on thy temples wreathes o' rue, And mournful rest on Charlotte's tomb; Bid Windsor Palace wave wi' yew, And ceaseless wail her early doom. The Battle-Song. Raise high the battle-song To the heroes of our land; Strike the bold notes loud and long To Great Britain's warlike band. Burst away like a whirlwind of flame, Wild as the lightning's wing; Strike the boldest, sweetest string, And deathless glory singâ To their fame. See Corunna's bloody bed! 'Tis a sad, yet glorious scene; There the imperial eagle fled, And there our chief was slain. Green be the turf upon the warrior's breast, High honours sealed his doom, And eternal laurels bloom Round the poor and lowly tomb Of his rest. Strong was his arm of might When the war-flag was unfurled; But his soul when peace shone bright, Beamed love to all the world. And his name through endless ages shall endure; High deeds are written fair In that scroll, which time must spare, And thy fame's recorded thereâ Noble Moore. Yonder's Barossa's height Rising full upon my view, Where was fought the bloodiest fight That Iberia ever knew, Where Albion's bold sons to victory were led. With bay'nets levelled low They rushed upon the foe, Like an avalanche of snow From its bed. Sons of the âLonely Isle,â Your native courage rose, When surrounded for a while By the thousands of your foes. But dauntless was your chief, that meteor of war; He resistless led ye on, Till the bloody field was won, And the dying battle-groan Sunk afar. Our song Balgowan share, Home of the chieftain's rest; For thou art a lily fair In Caledonia's breast. Breathe, sweetly breathe, a soft love-soothing strain, For beauty there doth dwell In the mountain, flood, or fell, And throws her witching spell O'er the scene. But not Balgowan's charms Could lure the chief to stay; For the foe were up in arms In a country far away. He rushed to battle, and he won his fame; Ages may pass by, Fleet as the summer's sigh, But thy name shall never dieâ Gallant Graham. Strike again the boldest strings To our great commander's praise; Who to our memory brings âThe deeds of other days.â Peal for a lofty spirit-stirring strain; The blaze of hope illumes Iberia's deepest glooms, And the eagle shakes his plumes There in vain. High is the foeman's pride, For they are sons of war; But our chieftain rolls the tide Of battle back afar. A braver hero in the field ne'er shone; Let bards with loud acclaim Heap laurels on his fame, âSinging gloryâ to the name Of Wellington. Could I with soul of fire Guide my wild unsteady hand, I would strike the quivering wire, Till it rung throughout the land. Of all its war-like heroes would I sing; Were powers to soar thus given, By the blast of genius driven I would sweep the highest heaven With my wing. Yet still this trembling flight May point a bolder way, Ere the lonely beam of night Steals on my setting day. Till then, sweet harp, hang on the willow-tree; And when I come again, Thou wilt not sound in vain, For I'll strike thy highest strainâ Bold and free. On the Abdication of Napoleon. Oh, stately now will be Moscow! Green laurels on her banks may grow, For haughty Paris is laid low, Nae shelt'rin' bield she'll have o't. Bourbon's gay lily fair will bloom; The eagle's got a bloody tomb; And whare's the stamm'ring king o' Rome, Papa, and a' the lave o't? France may rejoice from shore to shore, She sees her snaw-white flag once more, An's dashed awa the tri-color, Nae mair to be the slave o't. Huzza for Alexander! now He's weel performed his fearless vow, May laurels wave round Blucher's brow, Wha'll endless glory have o't. Gae wreaths to them wha fame ha'e won, And the brightest 'twine for Erin's sonâ Oh noble, glorious Wellington A deathless name will have o't! Spain weel may bless wi' gratefu' e'e, The conqueror wha set her free; And France adore with bended knee. Him wha ilk inch did save o't. Elba's great king, like some crush'd flower, Wha ance rejoiced in godlike power, Kens there's nae sweet but has its sourâ Scarce Elba-room he'll have o't? Bright as a glorious orb of day Has been our noble Regent's sway; Then here's to him and Castlereagh, Britain, and a' the brave o't! The Lady Isle. How sweetly wild's yon Isle at night, When the pale moon streams forth her light; When Autumn sheds her dews of balm, And all around is still and calm. The sea's then like a golden bed, Whereon some child of Summer's laid; So darkly brown appears the while, The lone, romantic Lady Isle. What though on it is never seen The charming sward of emerald green; What though appears no wilding flower, No fairy shade, no rosy bower, No sweet cascade, no murmuring stream, Nor couches meet for lover's dream; Yet there the child of song might smile, And bless the lonely Lady Isle. When Winter rears his awful form, And sends abroad the howling storm, And the lone Isle appears to be Some bark amid a roaring sea; When nought is to be seen afar, But one wide elemental war, 'Tis grand as lightning gleams the while, To view the lonely Lady Isle. Inchery. Fareweel, ye hills, ye braes, ye glens, Ye towering woods, and leafy dens; Fareweel, ilk spot that memory kens Amang the heaths o' Inchery. Fareweel, ye hallan, auld but dear, Ye've sheltered a' our bairnhood year. We'll never hae, we sairly fear, A hame sae sweet as Inchery. Fareweel, ye hills; fareweel, ye springs, Ye glens where sweet the blackbird sings, An' woods that wi' its music rings, Amang the hills o' Inchery. Nae mair we'll stray the braes amang; Nae mair we'll hear the blackbird's sang; Nae mair in spring-time when it's thrang We'll guide the plow in Inchery. A stranger and a stranger's son, They tend our flocks, and till our grun'; A bauld intruder sits upon Our father's seat in Inchery. On the Birth of a Daughter. This day we gat your letter, aunty, An' readin't made us unco canty; I doubtna but ye will be vaunty O'the wee ladyâ May she ne'er be o' duty scanty To mam or daddy. May God watch o'er her day and night, An' keep life's morning cloudless bright; May no damp mildew ever blight The opening flower; But time move on in sweet delight Till her last hour. When reason's ripened into years, May she repay your tender cares, Escape the wicked subtle snares That peace destroy, And shed upon your auld grey hairs The cup o' joy. That God may heal the mother tree, And keep the plant frae danger free, While the young sprouts around may be Beneath His care, And trouble frae ye a' may flee, Is my warmest prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS. The Maid of Oronsey. Oh! stopna, bonny bird, that strain; Frae hopeless love itsel' it flows; Sweet bird, oh! warble it again, Thou'st touched the string o' a' my woes; Oh! lull me with it to repose, I'll dream of her who's far away, And fancy, as my eyelids close, Will meet the Maid of Oronsey. Couldst thou but learn frae me my grief, Sweet bird, thou'dst leave thy native grove, And fly to bring my soul relief To where my warmest wishes rove; Soft as the cooings of the dove, Thou'dst sing thy sweetest, saddest lay, And melt to pity and to love The bonny Maid of Oronsey. Well may I sigh and sairly weep, The song sad recollections bring; Oh! fly across the roaring deep, And to my maiden sweetly sing; 'Twill to her faithless bosom fling Remembrance of a sacred day; But feeble is thy wee bit wing, And far's the isle of Oronsey. Then, bonny bird, wi' mony a tear I'll mourn beside this hoary thorn, And thou wilt find me sitting here Ere thou canst hail the dawn o' morn; Then high on airy pinions borne, Thou'lt chant a sang o' love and wae, An' soothe me weeping at the scorn Of the sweet Maid of Oronsey. And when around my weary head, Soft pillowed where my fathers lie, Death shall eternal poppies spread, An' close for aye my tearfu' eye; Perched on some bonny branch on high, Thou'lt sing thy sweetest roundelay, And soothe my âspirit, passing byâ To meet the Maid of Oronsey. Mary of Sweet Aberfoyle. The sun hadna peeped frae behind the dark billow, The slow-sinking moon half-illumined the scene, As I lifted my head frae my care-haunted pillow, An' wandered to muse on the days that were gane. Sweet hope seemed to smile o'er ideas romantic, An' gay were the dreams that my soul would beguile; But my eyes filled wi' tears as I viewed the Atlantic, An' thought on my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle. Though far frae my hame in a tropical wild-wood, Yet the fields o' my forefathers rose on my view; An' I wept when I thought on the days of my childhood, An' the vision was painful the brighter it grew. Sweet days! when my bosom with rapture was swelling, Though I knew it not then, it was love made me smile; Oh! the snaw-wreath is pure where the moon-beams are dwelling, Yet as pure is my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle. Now far in the east the sun slowly rising, Brightly gilded the top of the tall cabbage-tree; And sweet was the scene such wild beauties comprising, As might have filled the sad mourner with rapture and glee. But my heart felt nae rapture, nae pleasant emotion, The saft springs o' pleasure had lang, lang been sealed; I thought on my home 'cross a wide stormy ocean, And wept for my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle. The orange was bathed in the dews o' the morning, An' the bright draps bespangled the clustering vine; White were the blossoms the lime-tree adorning, An' brown was the apple that grew on the pine. Were I as free as an Indian chieftain, Sic beautiful scenes might give pleasure the while; But the joy o' a slave is aye waverin' an' shiftin', An' a slave I'm to Mary of sweet Aberfoyle. When the mirk cloud o' fortune aboon my head gathers, An' the golden shower fa's whare it ne'er fell before; Oh! then I'll revisit the land of my fathers, An' clasp to this bosom the lass I adore. Hear me, ye angels, who watch o'er my maiden (Like ane o' yoursel's, she is free frae a' guile), Pure as was love in the garden o' Eden, Sae pure is my Mary of sweet Aberfoyle. Home. What is't at times that makes me rave? What is't that draws the heavy sigh? What is't, while looking o'er the wave, That brings the tear-drop in my eye? It is because I'm doomed to roam, And mourn my sweet, my native home. The Indian landscapes fair to view, In wild majestic grandeur dressed, Each flow'ret of the gaudiest hue Blooms in this garden of the west; But through these scenes I sadly roam, And mourn my sweet, my native home. The maids are gentle as the dove, With locks of jet and cheeks of brown, Their eyes ne'er dart but beams of love; Their brows ne'er wrinkle with a frown. Yet careless from them all I roam, To mourn my sweet, my native home. But why need I thus idly pine? The storm of woe may soon be o'er; Pleasure and joy again be mine, And I may see my fields once more. Again perhaps I need not roam, To mourn my sweet, my native home. Land of my fathers, I'll rejoice, If I no more from thee will stray, When on thy hills I raise my voice, And trill to thee a Scottish lay: For though I have been doomed to roam, I love my sweet, my native home. Mary Gray. TuneââSally Roy.â Once William swore the sacred oath, That of my love he'd never weary, And I gave him my virgin troth; But now he's turned awa' frae Mary. I thought his heart was linked to mine So firm that it could never stray; Yet, William, may that peace be thine Which thou hast ta'en frae Mary Gray. I once was happy in his love; No gloomy prospect made me dreary; I thought that he would never rove, But aye be faithfu' to his Mary. Bright on me shone sweet pleasure's sun; I sported in its gladdening ray; But now the evening shades are come, And soon will close round Mary Gray. Yet, William, may no gloomy thought Of my love ever make thee dreary; I've suffered much, 'twas dearly bought; Peace now has fled frae wretched Mary. And when some maid, more loved than me, Thou lead'st to church on bridal day, Perhaps the lowly grave you'll see Of poor, neglected Mary Gray. The Twa Sutors. The wind roared up the Frith o' Forth, Through continent and isle, man, An' blew a lass frae Borro'ness To bonny Aberfoyle, man. A northern wind sometimes brings wae, When young lambs feel its breath, man; But this east wind, aweel a wat, Has brought us muckle scaith, man. It's tined us o' our sutors baith, In truth, we have but twa, man, For ever since they've seen the lass Nought have they done ava, man. They've quit their lingles an' their lasts, Their awls an' rossin ends, man; An' when we'll gang dry shod again, The feint a body kens, man. Jamie does naething a' the day But wander through the knowes, man, An' seeks amang the deep peat hags For a' the puir drooned ewes, man. Nae doot the love-lorn sutor sees His emblem in the sheep, man, Wha droons himsel' for sake o' love In moss hags, dark and deep, man. An' Robin roams frae tryste tae fair, Where mony ane has bled, man, An' cares nae if in Jean's behalf His noblest blood be shed, man. But I'll gang an' whisper in Jean's lug, Sae tak' a gude advice, man, An' toss a bawbee up for ane, An' no be unco nice, man. Then we'll get baith our sutors back, When ilka thing's complete, man, Sin' meet at Jeanie's wedding dance, Wi' hail shoon on our feet, man. FINIS.</field>
