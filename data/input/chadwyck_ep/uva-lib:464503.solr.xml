The first chapitere tellis but les Throuch quham þis buke translatit wes. As men ar be thare qualiteis Inclynit to diuersiteis, Mony ?arnys for till heir Off tymes þat befor þaim wer, Staittis changeit and þe greis; Quharfor of sic antiquiteis Thai þat set haly þare delite Gestis or storyis for to write, Outhir in metere or in prose, Flurist fairly thare purpose With qwaynt and curiouse circumstance, For to raise hertis in plesance, And þe heraris till exsite Be wit or will to do þare delite; As Gwydo de Calumpna quhile, The pohete Omere and Virgile, Fairly formyt there tretyss, And curiously dytit there storyis. Sum vsit bot in plane maner Off aire done dedis thar mater To writ, as did Dares of Frigy, That wrait of Troy all þe story, Bot in till plane and opin stile, But curiouse wordis or subtile. Herefor I haue set myn entent, My wit, my will and myn assent, Fra þat I sene had storyis seire In cornyklis, as þai writtin were, Thare mater in to forme to draw Out of Latyne in Inglis saw. For storyis to heire ar dilectable, Suppose þat sum be nocht bot fable; And set to þis I gif my will, My wit I ken sa skant þartill That I drede saire þame till offend That can me and my work amend, Gif I writ ouþer maire or lese, Bot as þe story beris witnes; For, as I said, rude is my wit And febill to put all my writ, Gif clerkis bring þaim to knawlage Off þe Latyne in oure langage, Till ilk manis vnderstanding For diuersnes of thare changeing; Sa that throuch foly or nysetee I dout confoundit for to be. Bot, lordis, gif youre curtasy Forbeire me in þis ieperdy, And fra thare br?th wald me defend, That can repreve and will nocht mend, Haiffand excusit my sempilnes, Se? þat I set my besynes Till all youre plesance generaly, Suppose this tretise simpilly I maid at þe instance of a larde That has my seruice in his warde, Schir Iohne of Wemys be rycht name, A worthy knycht and of gud fame, Albeid his lordschip be nocht like To gretare lordis in þe kinrik, He mone of neid be personer Off quhat kin blame sa euer I beire; Syne throuch his bidding and counsaill Off det I spendit my travale; For all honest det suld be Qwyt with possibilite, And bowsumnes, that, as þe wice Sayis, is better þan sacrifice; For in þe sacrifice þe slayne, And nocht þe slaare, tholis þe pane; Sa þat þe slaare haif þe meid, The pane is soft he tholis in deid. Than suld with rycht þe meid be maire That sufferis in him self þe saire, Quhare bowsumnes makis fredome thrall, And lyking vnder aw to duell, Now as bondage vnder law, Bot at lyking grace suld knaw. Thus set I in like assay Wilfully my det to pay: Symple or sufficient quheþer it be To bowsumnes ay ?eild I me. And, for I will nane beire þe blame Off my defalt, þis is my name Be bapteme, Andro of Wyntoune, Off Sanct Androis a channoune Regular, bot nocht forthy Off þame all þe leste worthy; Bot of þare grace and þar fawour I wes but merit maid priour Off þe Inche within Lochlevin, Berand þarof my titill evin, Of Sanct Androis diocy, Betuix þe Lummondis and Wynarty. The titill of þis tretise haill I will be callit Originall, For þat begynnyng sall mak cleire Be plane procese oure matere. As of angell and of man First to ryse þe kynd began; And how, efter þare creatioun, Than grew in to successioun, Wyde spred in to þare cuntreis, Thare statis and þare qualiteis, Till þe tyme þat Nynus king Raise and tuke þe gouernyng Off Babilone in Assyry. Fra him syne distinctly It is my purpose till afferme This tretise in till certane terme, Haldand tyme be tyme þe dait, As cornyklaris befor me wrate, Requirand þe correctioun Off gretare of perfectioun. For few writtis I redy fand That I couth draw to my warand. Part of þe Bibill with þat at Peris Comestor ekit in his ?eris, Off Crosyus and Frere Martyne, With Scottis and Inglis storyis syne, And vthir incedens seire, Accordand like to þis mater. To þis my wit is wallowit dry, But fleure or froyte; bot nocht for thy To furthire fairly þis purpose, The help beseik I of þat Rose That spanys, spredis and euer springis, In plesans of þe king of kingis. CHAPTER II. The secund chapiter tellis how þis In sevin bukis devidit is. Be þe [eldis] I will devise In sevin bukis þis tretise; Bot I will nocht ay þare mak end, Quhare storyis makis þe [eldis] kend. The first buke fra þe begynnyng Sall trete till þat Nynus king Off Babilone in Assyry Gouernyt þat lordschip halely; And þat wes in till Abrahamys dais, As þarof þe storyis sayis. The secund buke sall trete fra þan Till Brutus come in Mare Brettane; That wes, as can þe story tell, Quhen iugis iugit Israell. The thrid buke sall contenit be Till of Rome wer maid þe cete; That wes quhen that Acha? king Israell had in gouernyng, And þe proffeit Ysaye Maid and prechit his prophesye. The [ferd] buke quhill þat Crist wes borne To saif mankynd þat wes forlorne. The fift quhill þat þe Scottis Put out of Scotland þe Pictis. The sext quhill Malcolme oure first king Scotland tuke in gouernyng. The sevint sall mak conclusioun Off þe nobill generatioun And of þe blessit gud lynnage That come of þe mariage Off Malcolme king of Scotland And Mergret aire till Yngland. CHAPTER III. The thrid chapiter expremys in mynd The stait of angell and mankynd. Sanct Gregour in ane omelye Thus sayis of angellis opinly: The kynd of angellis and of men God maid of nocht him for to ken; And for he wald þat kynd suld be Ay lestand in eternite, Till his schap and his awne liknes Angell and man formyt wes. Off angellis orderis thrise thre In his scripturis rehersis he. The name of angell to devise Is nocht of kynd bot of office; A messinger suld ane angell be Quhen chargeit oucht to say is he. Angellis we may spretis call, Bot angellis are nocht spretis all. The angellis we fynd vsuale Titulit be names spirituall. The first is callit Mychaell, Gabriell syne and Raphaell. Off angellis nature and þare stait I trow fere better þan I wait; And better is þat we all commend To God þat we can nocht defend, Sen na thing is þat he na may; Than we oure solely aucht to say That may nocht in ws consauit be, Na pruffit be leill autorite. Forthy fra it I turne my stile Off mankynd to carp a quhile. CHAPTER IV. How God maid Adam and Eve his make, And how he for þare syne tuke wraik. Off Adam oure originall And Adammys kyn is cummyn haill, That in þe feild of Damask faire, Off nature and of nobill aire, Or ellis in þe vale of Ebron, As sum men haldis opinioun; Like maid to God he formyt wes In his schap and his liknes, And sa first formyt at devise Translatit wes in Paradise; And thare liffand in þat schap, Slepand till he tuke a nap, Out of his side God tuke a rib In all thing till him like and sib, That woman maid wes þat we Eve call, For scho wes moder till ws all. Than þare stait wes innocent And all thing bowit at þar entent; And name to bestis Adam gaif Sic as we ?it hald and haif, And Eve he callit þare a woman, Sen scho wes of his flesche and bane. Off matrimone þe sacrament Than raise in þat stait innocent, And of all thingis at þare plesance Thai had enewch? at haboundance, Ay till þai baith brokin had The commandment at God þaim maid, And miskennit þare creature. Tharfor þai fell fra gret honour, And knew þan þat þai nakit ware, And had of clething gret mistere, For þai wrocht nouþer lynt nor woll, Bot leiffis of þe tre to pull, Quhare of a weid þai maid þat tyde Thare nakit membris for till hyde; And wes put out of Paradise, A propire place at all devise, Haboundand in till all delite, Baith of plesance and profite, Off froyte and foullis and feildis faire, Off herbis and of nobill aire, Off burely branchis and of bowis, Off cliftis, craggis and of clewis. The tre of lif þarin wes set; Off þat tre quhasa mycht get, He suld in lif ay lestand be, But seiknes or mortalite. This ilk erdly pardiss In to þe este of Asye lyiss. Quhen Adam wes in to þat quhile Put out of þat place exile, For to keep it and lat nane in Befor it set is Cherubim, That may be vnderstanding rycht A stuff of angellis, stark and brycht, With a suerd as blude als rede, Ay turnand for to keip þat steid. Within þat proper place without peire Thare is a well of watter cleire; Out of þat well cummys fludis foure To tempre þe erd þat þai ran oure. Ane of þai watteris is callit Ganges, Syne Tygyre, Nyle and Eufrates. Nyle wes callit efter Gysone, And Ganges first wes callit Phisone. In Paradiss þai are vnkend, Bot vtouth it þai ryne one end. At þe hill of Escobares In Ynde þe hede is of Ganges; Agane þe este þe streme is gayne, Sa rynnand in þe Occiane. Beside a hill is hattyne Acland Off Nyle þe revere is springand; Bot syne þe erd it swellyis in, Quhare throuch all Ynd it vsis to ryne; It brystis out syne at a strand That be þe Rede Se lyis strekand. All Ethiope it rynnis about, And throuch Egipt rynnis out; Departit syne in fif and twa, In sindry partis it rynnis swa; By Alexandere þe gret cete It enteris in þe Greke Sea. Tygris syne and Eufrates And Ermony þai tuke þare rase; Agane þe sowth þai are rynnand, Sa to þe see þare streme strekand. Hard with mankynd þan it stude; Adam werthit to wyne his fude Off þe erd þat waryit was In his werk and his besynes, And with his swete till ete his breid, Driffand his lif to dulefull dede. Adam one Eve gat sonnys twa, Cayne and Abell callit were þai. How þai liffit and in quhat wiss To God þai maid þare sacrifice, Abell with gud deuotioun, Cayne with indignatioun, The Bibill tellis it opinly, Tharfor I lat it now ga by; Bot þe ensampill is felloune; Quha dois nocht with deuocioun His det to God in his seruice, Off offerand, teynd or sacrifice, Bot makis his excusatioun With ire and indignatioun, How may he traist to wyne meid Than Cayne did bot gif he speid, Bot will and waverand to be ay In duyle and dreid till his end day, Off ony þat may him fynd of rass In hydlis or in opin place, Cowartly to tak his dede, Disparit all of gud remede? CHAPTER V. How Adam gat Abell and Cayne That throuch Lamek efter wes slane. This Cayne to sone Enok gat, The quhilk gat Iareth efter þat; Enok a tovne gert biggit be, And gert call Enok þat cete. This Iareth gat Malaleell, The quhilk þat gat Matusaell; Off this Matusaell gat Lamell; Quha þat likis of him to spell He wes þe first found [lemmanry], Throuch lust, liking and lichory. Till him allane wes wiffis twa, That Ade wes callit and Sella. He wes þe first þat schot in bow, Ouþer with bolt or braid arow. Sa fell it quhen he fal?eit sycht, For eild had myrknyt all his mycht, His [boy] bad him he suld draw neire, Quhare þat he said he saw a deire. With þat þe takle vp he drew, And with þat schot he Cayne slew That lay lurkand þare in a busk; Than to þat boy he gaif a rusk, All brayne-wod in to þat steid, He dang him with his bow to deid. This Lameke Iabell gat on Ade; He wes þe first þat gert be maid Tentis to be borne about, As catall lesurit in and out, Quhare hyrdis mycht in herbryit be Baith day and nycht to keip þar fee. He gert disseuir first and keip, As ?e se now, þe gait fra scheip; The brukit bestis and þe waire He gert depart fra quhit and faire; The ?oung he kepit fra þe auld, And oisit þaim to be bocht and sauld, And syne be craft and be delite Off mylk and wooll gat proffite. This Lameke gat on Ade withall Ane oþer sone wes callit Tuball. The story gerris ws understand He wes þe first þat musik fand With hammaris wirkand one styddy, Quhare men wer wirkand in a smyddy. This Tuball quhen he herd Adam tell In prophesy, as efter fell, That flude and fyre suld all ourga, And fordo all it mycht ourta, Off sic matere as he had He gert twa pillaris þan be maid: Off tyld of plaistere wes þe tane, The toþer wes maid of marbell stane. The tane to sauf men fra þe flude, [The toþir fra fyir, thocht it was woyd; And in þe twa he gart full tyte All þe arte of musik wryte, Sua þat it mycht haldin be Wnfail?eand in posteritie. Iosephus sayis in till his buke, Quha can weill þat story luik, That ?itt in to þe Surry land The pillair of merbill is standand. This Lamek gat ?itt one Sella Tubalkayin and Noema. Tubalkayin delytit haill Be vsit craft to wirk mettaill, Irne and steill, leid and tyne, To ?ett or beit or graif þairin. His sister þan callit Neoma Scho begouth on hand to ta Wewyng þat nevir þan before Was vsit be travell or rhetour. Of Caynnis generatioun, Na of þair successioun, Is na ma found in to story; Thairfore I latt þame now ga by. Sum storeys sayis þat Noyes flude Drownit þame þat þat tyme stude. CHAPTER VI. Off Adamis generatioun And of his sounis lamentatioun. Adam murnit ane hundreþ ?eir Abell his sonnis slauchter deir, And quhen þat slauchter was for?ettin On Eve Adam Syþ hes gottin. Seyth gat Enos þat vsit to call On God in till his werkis all, In prayer and in oresoun, And in speciall deuotioun. Enos gat, þe buik can tell, Caynaane, þat gat Malaliell; Malaliell he Iaryt gat, The quhilk gat Enok eftir þat. This Enok fand, as I hard tell, First with lettres for to spell, And he tuk in to delyte To set togiddir fast and wryte. In till his tyme he buikis wrayte That drownit war in Noyes spayte. Till God he was in all plesand, Thairfore he is ?itt levand, Bydand þe Antecristis come, Before þe mekle day of dome. Off Enok come Matussale Of quhome Lamek [that] gat Noye. Now þe first eild endis heir, In to þe quhilk ay ?eir be ?eir Saxtene hundreth saxty and sevin, Gife þat þe Ebrewyis rekkynnis evin; The ten and saxty clerkis wyiss As þai fand in þair storyis Twa thousand and tua hundreþ ?eir And foure and fourtie passit cleir, Thai vsit to count in þair reknyng Than fra þe wardlis begyning, Gife ony lettres þan þai wrayte, Thair vse was þan to sett þair dait; As we now fra þe birth of God Rekkyinnis ?eiris evin and ode, Sua rekkynnit þai in þair counting Fra þe wardlis begynning. CHAPTER VII. Heir may ?e find in þis steid Quhame of Gyantis couth spreid. In till þis tyme þat I of tell Wer gyandis wakkand ferss and fell, That like till men war in figure,] Bot þai were fere maire of stature. One quhat wiss or quhat manere Thir ilk gyantis gottin were, Sindry haldis opinioune; I will mak na conclusioun, Bot Sethis sonis, as þai say, Luffit C?nys dochteris stout and gay, And gat vp?n þaim bodely Thir gyantis þat were sa forsy. One sindry spretis on þare wiss Slepand women wald suppriss With maistry, quayntiss or with slicht, That gat þire gyantis of gret mycht. Bot how sa euer þai gettyn be, A gyantis name in properte Off þe erd is for to say, That geos witnes werray; The Grekis in þe langage all Geos þe erd þai vse to call. All þare kynd þat liffand stude Drownyt were in Noyis flude. Sum men haldis opinioune That in þe vaill of Ebroune Efter þat grew gyantis ma. In Egipt sum men sayis alsua Gyantis come and of þat kynd Come Enachim, and of þat strynd Come Galioth þat Dauid ?oung Slew with þe stane cast of a slung. Thai speid and pas fra land to land, And Brut in Brettane of þaim fand; Coryne, þat of his cumpany Wes maist, and aucht ?e sen?eory Off Cornwale first, had gret liking To cast þai carllis in werselling. Amang þaim ane wes mekle of mycht Goge-Magoge to name he hecht. Ane aik wes na mare in his hand Na now in ouris ane hesill wand; He wes xii. cubitis large one lenth, And þarwith wes he strang of strenth. He come with gyantis full twenty One Brutus with his cumpany; Bot ?it þis Coryne þat tyme wes Nocht with Brutus in þat place, Quhen Brutus with þaim faucht sa fast Till þai were wincust at þe last. There þis Gog-Magog wes tane And haldin be him allane, For to se how þis Coryne Wald pruf with him in werslyne; And as þai met first in þat gamyn, Ather embrasit vþer samyn; That freik sa fast þis Coryne thristit Till in his syde thre ribbis bristit, And Coryne þan with all his mycht Hely hewit þat husk on hicht, And till a crag þat wes him by He baire him fast, and spedely That swayne he swakkit oure þat hicht Till one his crag he gert him licht; Sa dogitly he doune him duschit Till bak and bowellis all to bruschit. Off gyantis can I na mare tell, There ending thus in Brettane fell. CHAPTER VIII. Off Noe and of Noyis flude, And of his barnetyme ill and gud. Noe wes a man rychtwiss, Leill and perfite at all deviss. He fand first throuch subtilite How wyne suld grow and wonyng be. Quhen mannis thocht wes gevin till ill And drawin all fra Goddis will, He wist þat þare suld fall a flude Till vndo all þat liffand stude. To sauf him and his sonnys thre, Thare wiffis foure, but ma men?e, He gert of Goddis bidding mak Ane arche in maner of a crake, That in oure langage now vse we To call the schip of Noe. Abufe in hicht it narow wes, And vnderneth it largear wes. The Hebrewis sayis þe xvii. day Off þe moneth we call May, Fife hundreth ?eris quhen he wes auld, Noe þat we befor of tauld, And sevynnit þat rekynnit wer, In þat arche all enterit ar. Off best and bird, baith wild and tame, Paire be paire, and name be name, As he bidding had clerely, Within þat arche he gert herbery. A hundreth dayis and fifty gud The watteris woxe and ay wer wode, Off wellis waiffit wawis wyde Oure hyrne and hyrst fra syde to syde; Boggis beillit out and bristit, And ranys reith befor þat restit; Fourty dais with forss fell Schot out þare schouris scharp and snell; Oure fyrth and feild flet þe flude And fordid all þat it oure yude. The arche wes waiffit oure hillis hie Till one þe hecht of Armenee Ground it tuke in steid of havin. Bot Noe forouth þat send a ravin For to gett wittering and knawlege Gif þat þe flude began to swage. Bot all þat sending wes in vane; For quhy þat foull come nocht agane, Bot one a carioune fell full gredy, Sa saw he na mare of þis corby. Than send he furth a dow to wit, As þe story witnessis it, And scho brocht in hire beik all belif A branche agane of grene olife. Be þat Noe knew and vnderstude That oure all scalit wes þe flude. The schip he left and land has tane, That ilk day a ?ere oure gane, As þai enterit þe arche within, Man and best, mare and myne. The rayne bow wes with hewis twa, Rud and wattry baith were þai, Than at þe first wes sene with e, Abufe þaim one þe cluddis hie. Than maid Noe his sacrifice Plesand to God apone his wise. Frute and herbis þare vsit till eit, As mawis or caill or violet, Nuttis or apillis or akcorne; Sic wes þe lif þai led beforne. Bot syne þai tuke vp to þare fude For till eit flesche withoutin blude, Rostit or sodyne or in paist, As þai thocht best and suetest, And liffit in liking and in eiss, All anerly bot God to pleiss, Sa þat þare generatioun Mycht spreid in to successioun. As happinnit efter vpon a day, As Noe slepand drunkin lay, For þe wyne him oure tane had And maid him sumdeill all oure glaid, And nakit were his harnes hare; For bak and butowis all lay baire, As I supposs, quha þan wald seik, Amang þaim all wes nocht a breik. Than Cam þat wes þe myddilmest broþer, Saw him ly sa befor all othire. He lewch and gammynit in þat tyde, His faderis membris wald he nocht hyde, Bot gernyt and gapit with his gomys, And skornyt fast his faderis lomys. The toþer twa, quhen þai come by And sa þar fader sa gatis ly, With eiss and honour þai him kepit, And coverit him quhill he had slepit. Quhen Noe wakenyt and had wittering That Cain had maid at him hething, He gaif him þare his malesoune, And all his generatioune, And at Sem his sone suld be Lord of Cain, and at he To Seme and Iaphet in thrallage Suld serue and mak þaim baith ymage. And þus his priss begouth to paire, Sene he wes eldest nixt þe aire, That he suld serue þe yongar broþer, How euer it hapnit of þe toþer. CHAPTER IX. Heir may ?e wit withoutin weire Quham of come carllis and knychtis deire. Sem, Cam and Iaphet, all thre, Thire were þe sonnys of Noe. Off þire come men of mekill mycht, To statis growand and till hycht, And generaly of all degre All manere of men come of þire thre. Off Sem þat wes þe eldest broþer Preistheid come befor all vthire. Sum þat vsit of him to speik Said þat he wes þat Melchideche That offerit till Abrahame wyne and breid Quhen þe kingis foure were dede, The quhilk Abrahame persewit His brothire sone quhen he reskewit. Quha lukis þe Bibill wittirly May fynd of þis a faire story. Off Semys generatioun, Be lynyall successioun, Wes Ihesu Crist of Mary borne, To sauf mankynd at wes forlorne. Off Cain þe neist for his outtrage Come seruitut and foull bondage. Off Iaphet, youngest of þe thre, Come first knychtis dignitie. Thire aucht þe landis halely Off Affrik, Europe and Asy, And þe foure kinrikis principale Be þare successioun lynyall Wes occupiit, and Belus king Maid in est his first stering. And þat land þan wes halely Callit þe kinrik of Assyry; And in þe west art þar vpone The kinrik raiss of Sythioune; Bot efter syne to name it had In Grece þe lordschip of Archade. There Agolews there wes king And had it haill in gouernyng. And in þe north art of Sythy Casnes had þe sen?eory, And Menes king in þe south art Tuke all Egipt till his part. In þire foure partis seuerale Thire kinrikis all callit principall, Vndire foure kingis þat raiss Quhen Noys flude all swagit wes, And grew in gret mycht mony ?ere; Bot part of þaim syne changeit were In vthire kinrikis seuerale, As thai were wonnyng throuch batall. CHAPTER X. How þe warld wes devidit in thre Amangis þe thre sonnis of Noe. To Sem þe eldest halely Fell all þe landis of Aisy, That fra þe north throuch est outstreikis Vnto þe south quhill at it rekis. The erd swa delt in twa partiis Asy þe tane half occupiis; The toþer part þan delt in twa Europ haldis and Affrica, As men may be [a roundall] se Merkit to be delt in thre. It to þe est of Asy lyis That propire place of Paradiss, The quhilk is circulit all about With wallis of fyre within and out, And kepit sa with Cherubin That liffand man may nane cum in. Cherubin is to say ane oste Off Angellis þat it kepis but boste. And betuix Ynde and Paradiss Mony dissert landis lyiss, Off holmys, hewis and of hillis; For corne nor crop þat na man tillis, Is nane one lif þat þare dare duell For bestis wyld baith ferss and fell. Out of a hill callit Calkasus The watter is rynnand of Indus, And efter þat watter, as we fynd, The kinrik is callit of Ynde. Fra north and south þe streme it strekis, [In] till þe Reid Se quhill it reikis. The west marche of Ynd suld be Streikand till þe Occiane Se. Ynde wes callit first Eiulat, And syne þe name of Inde it gat; For þe watter of Indus Rynnis throuch it fra Calkasus, And enteris in þe Occiane, To þe gret ile of Tabrobane. Within þat ile are citeis tene Stuffit with wittaill gud and men. Thare is twa sommaris in a ?ere And twa wynteris als but weire, And all tyme þat ile is sene With gerss growand euire grene. Thare lyis within þat se The yle of Tigris and Argente, And þai twa ylis, as þai say, Off siluer are haboundand ay, And als of gold rycht plenteously Flurisand ay dantely. Hillis hie of gold are there; Bot for grypis and griffonys dare Nane cum neire be nycht nor day, And for dragonys þat will þaim slay. In Ynde als there is perdee The ile of Caspis in þe se, And of þe hill þat lyis thereby It takis name of properly, Quhare Gog and Magog þat Iowis wes Inclusit were in gret straitnes. For Alexander, þe mychty king, Neir by it maid his passing With his oste as man of weire; Thai sa inclusit maid him prayer That for his povste þai mycht be Lovsit of þat strait all fre. Than askit he and herd well tell That fra þare God of Israell Thai with drew þaim and changeit fay, And forthy closit þare were þai. Than preffit he with werkmen thraly Therein to steik þaim maire straitly; And quhen he saw all at þai wrocht Till his entent þai suffisit nocht, One kneis with gret deuocioune To God he maid his vrisoune At þat werk he wald fulfill Till his liking and his will. And at his prayere þan but dout All þe hillis there about, And þe crag and clewis all Crap to gidder as a wall Befor þaim, þat be na way Wyne out of þat place mycht þai, Bot mare strait na þai were ere Inclusit in þat place þai were, And be myrakle like it wes That God wald nocht at þai suld pass Out of þat steid, bot ?it þai Sall get out befor domysday, And mekle wa in warld sall wirk Agane þe law of halikirk. Sen God of mycht inclynit wes Till a Sarasyne throuch grace Quhat will he þan for ws all set, And we till him wald do our det? Bot fra his will quhen þat we wryth, Quhy suld he his mycht on ws kyth, Till ws in oure necessite, Or in to baill oure bute to be, Na ware his mercy þat excedis All oure gilt and oure mysdedis? And þus for oure gret wrechitnes We mone declyne his richtuisnes, And one his mekle mercy call, In oure defalt quhen þat we fall. Mercy and rychtuiss iugement Ar in him baith but argument. For þi suld we haif dreid and aw To leif his bidding and his law, Giffand ws fykkill, fals in fay, To wilfull werkis and sinfull play, For dout þat or we ws repent We mone appeire in iugement, And to ask mercy is to lait Quhen þe wayne is at þe ?et. In Ynde is landis fourty and foure, Quha þat sekis þaim all atoure; And þare are folkis þat callit wes Arryanys and Orestas, Cuntreis feill and woddis faire, And hillis hie vp to þe aire; And one sum hillis in to þat land The Pigmeus ar wonnand. Sum ar bot twa cubitis on hicht, And oft will with þe crennys fycht. Quhen þai are thre ?eris ald, but let, Thare barnis all þai bere and get, And viii. ?eris auld þai may nocht weild Thare wappinnis for febilnes of eild. Thare pepper growis þat of hew Is quhit till it [is] growand new. For edderis that are thare Off wenome and of stangis saire, Thare is na man at may it wyne With a fyre quhill þai it bryne, And sa reik can it make Fra þe quhit hew all blak. Thare are folkis vii. elnys on hycht, Machabeis þai call þaim rycht. Thai folkis vsis oft till assaill The grypis in to gret batall. Like to lyonis ar þare body, And scharp tallonys has certanely, And weyngis als, withoutin weire, As ?e se foullis haiffand heire. Aryanys and Bygamys Ledis þare lif on selcouth wiss; For in a fyre þai will þaim bryne, Wenand a better lif to wyne; And vthire sum will þare elderis sla, Quhen eild þaim happinnis till ourta. Thai seith þe flesche and gerris þe kyne Be semblit þerto, mare and myne, And etis sa up halely All þe flesche of þat body; And quha sa forsakis till eit Off þat flesche, with ire and threte Salbe forsakyne out of þat kyne, And neuer be reknyt mare þerin. And vþer folkis þat vsis till eit All raw flesche at þai may get And drinkis salt watter of þe see, Quheþer it cleire or droubly be. There ar ferlyis vthire seire Off þe quhilkis nane are sene of heire, That nane can tell [in] propirte Quheþer þai man or best suld be. Sum owth þare feit þare solis has, And vpone ilk fute viii. tais; And sum within þai cuntreis þare Like of heid till hundis are, With scharp nalis, and þai are cled In bestis skinnis, baith bak and bed. Thare voce, quhen þai are spekand, Ar like till hundis ay barkand. Sum women in thai landis alsua Beris bot anys, and all þai Borne þai are quhit of canys, Baith of berde and heid at anys; And in þare eild agane þar haire Worthis all blak be kynd but mare, And of eild ?it mony ?eire Extendis ws þat liffis heire. And vthire sum beris of ?eris fiff And passis nocht aucht ?eris of lif. Thare is folkis callit Armaspy, And has ane e certanely, And vthire sum bot a fut has, And ?it for speid þe deire he tais; And quhen þai ly doune for to sleip, Fra heit of sone þame for to keip, Than þat a fut vp þai streke, That it fra þame þe heit may breke. Within Ynde als within sum steid Thare liffis a folk withoutin heid, And in þe steid of þare foret Twa eyne are in þare schulderis set, And in þare breist are holis twa, In steid of noyse and mouth are þai. Besyde þe watter of Ganges A folkis men say liffand is Withoutin meit bot of þe aire, And þe smell of ane apill faire; And feill þai ony stynk about Thare throuch þai dee withoutin dout; And quhen þai travale in to weire That apill ay with þaim þai beire, That is þare fude in þare travale And haldis þare lif at þai nocht faill. Thare ar edderis sa gret, but weire, That þai will suelly vp a deire, And [swymmys] alsua our þat see That Ynde Occiane call we. In to þat land þare is alsua A best þai call Cenatta; That best is like of body maid Till ane ass, bot he is braid Off breist befor and in fassoune Off heid maste like till a lyoune; Till a horss like ar his feit And a horne in his foret meit; His mouth is mekle and rycht wyde Fra eire till eire on ather syde; A gret bane þai say has he In þe steid quhare his teeth suld be. He vsis mekle in his beire Sik noyis as man dois heire. In to þat land þai say suld be Ane oþer best callit Cale, And he is maste like till a horss In to þe fassoune of his corss, And beiris a gret tusk as a baire, And his taill as oliphantis are, And one his heid has hornis twa, Half ane elne lang ilkane of þai; And first he vses with þe tane To hald vp fechting and bargane; The toþer on his bak he strekis, Quhill he þe toþer bluntis or brekis, And þan he castis it on his bak; Than will he with þe toþer mak His bargane furth, and with þai twa His bargane vsis he to ma. He is a best of mekle pigh And blak and vgly als þerwith. In þat land þare is alsua A best men callis Mantigora; Off visage þai say like is he Vnto a man in all degre, Bot þe teeth þat are within His heid are set in chester twyne, And like of corss till a lyoune. His taill is like a scorpioune; His ene are ?allo, and his hew Is blude reid and ay like new. He is of voce like and of beire Till edderis þat hyssis as ?e heire, And of his lowp he is mare lycht Than ony foull is vpone flicht. He vsis mekill for till eit All manis flesche at he may get. Thare are oxin with hornys thre And horss feit as ?e heire se; And vthire bestis þare is withall The quhilk Monoteros þai call, And in fassoune of his corss Like in all thing a horss; Bot sic ane heid þai say has he As ?e vpone ane hart se; As oliphant his feit and tais, And as a swyne a taill he has; With a horne, and þat is set In þe myddis of his foret, And armys him þerwith als weill As men þaim armys in irne or steill; Off lenth foure fut large is þat horne And þerwith wonder scharp beforne. Thir bestis wonder felloune are, And vsis with gret rerd to rare, And with þat horne he werkis payne To þaim þat standis him agane. He may be tane and slane with slicht, Bot neuer dantit be na wicht. In to þis watter of Ganges Men sayis þat mony elis is That are xxx. fut of lenth And takkis þe oliphant throuch strenth, And oft syss gerris þaim drownyt be For ferdnes in to þe se. In to þe Ynde Se, þai say, Snaillis gret are fundin ay, And men makis of þare schell Houssis gret in for to duell. Thare are adamantis sa gud That will nocht brek but bukkis blude. In Ynde are vthire ferlyis seire That I leif for to reherss heire, Forthire mare to your knawlege Nocht translatit in oure langage. Fra Ynde to Tygire and by watteris twa Lyis a land hecht Parthya; In it are citeis thriss tene, And stuffit weill with meit and men. Off [men] þat come of Sythia That land is callit Parthia; And nixt þat land callit Parthy The land lyis of Aracusy. Off Aracusy, ane hill on hycht, That land has þe name of rycht. Neist it lyis halely The gret lordschip of Assyry: Off Semmys sonis þat Assure wes That land now þe name it has. Nixt lyis þe land of Medy, Off Medus king callit witterly. Syne lyis þe lordschip haill of Perss, Quhare Persus king, for to reherss, Gert first a cete biggit be, And syne þat lordschip Perss callit he. Off vertu þare are stanis twa, Pyr and Syles callit are þai; Pyr is of vertu for to bryne The hand þat it is closit in, And Siles waxis with þe mone And wanys with it sa alsone. In Perss wes first foundit nygramansy, And wichecraft and sossery, Throu Cain fundin þat syne wes Be name callit ?orestas, King of Brettane þat Nynus slew, To stait of lordschip first quhen he drew. With hillis hie þare landis are, And craggis strait oure all quhare, Wnproffitable for man or best, Evin as a lyne strekand on est Betuix þe gret revaris twa, Inde and Tygire callit are þai. Fra Tygire syne till Eufrates Mesopethanie first foundit wes, And for it set wes betuix þai twa, It hecht Mesopothania. Thare lyis þe tovne of Nynyve, That Nynus king gert biggit be. Quha throuch it haldis þe nerest wayis, Off lenth he fyndis it thre jurnayis, And neist it lyis þe regioune Off Calde and of Babilone, Quhat þat a toure of hughe hicht Wes biggit first throuch Menbrodis mycht; And þat toure Babell callit he Within þe kinrik of Calde, Quhare first wes foundit astronomy. Neist lyis þe land of Araby, And at we now Saba call; In it þe Sens is gottin all. There is þe mont of Synay, The hill of Oreb neire þerby, Moyses [þar] þe lawis wrait Quhare with wes reullit þe Iowis stait. There lyis þe land of Madyane, Quhare Ietro preste wes first ourman. There are men hecht Moabytis, Ydomys and Ammonytis, And Sarsynis of nacionis seire That may nocht all be reknyt heire. [Fra] þe watter of Eufrates The land of Serry lyis, but less, Strekand furth to þe Greke See; Thare wes of Damask þe cete, The cete of Antioche alsua That sumtyme wes callit Reblata; Conagyne and syne Phenesyis Neire Tyre and Sydone alsua lyis. Thare lyis þe hill als of Libane, Out of it cummys the flume Iurdane. Thare is þe land of Palestyne, That Ascalone wes callit syne; Thare is þe kingdome of Iude And all þe land of Cananee, Ierusalem and Samary; All thire ar lyand in Serry, And all þe land of Galile, With Na?areth þe faire cete Quhare Gabriell, þe angell brycht, Hailsit oure lady, quene of mycht, And said: “haill, Mary, blessit þov be, Full of grace and God with þe!” Thare is þe hill als of Thabore; Neire it is Sodome and Gomore, And þe v. citeis þat sank for syne And fylth of þaim þat duelt within; Quhare now is bot a deid see Withoutin folkis or frute of tre, And in þat see, withoutin dout, The watter þat cumis rynnand out In þe flume Iordane tais entre, Quhat way sa euer it rynnand be. Thare are mony Sara?enis, And folkis þat callit are Sabysynis, And diuerss nacionis and cuntreis, And mony gret and faire citeis That I leif now to rekyne heire, And þire landis, withoutin weire, Fra þe este oure lyis hie All strekand to þe Grekis Se, And xij. seire nacionis on þar wyss Wsand þare lawis and þare frenschess. CHAPTER XI. How sindry landis lyis marchiand And of sindry ferlyis in þaim beand. Aganis þe south to þire ar kynt All þe kinrik of Egipt; And lyis on est half þe Red Se. The west marche suld in Lybye be, Be north þe hill of Calkasus; Egipt lyis are marchit thus, With seire nacionis xx. and foure, Quha passis Egipt all attoure, And mony cete semely and faire, With toure and step and evin staire. First it wes callit Edoxia, In Latyne Bona Copia, Gud plente þat is to say. The broþer syne of Daynay, Egistus, king of beall fame, Girt call Egipt be his name. In it is alkyne haboundance That ganys to manis sustynance, Off wyne and walx, oile and quhete, And best and byrd, baith small and grete, Off fische in flude, of frute of tre, Thare is haboundance and plente. Sa clere and brycht þare is þe day That nakyne cloudis put licht away. Thare reueris ragis for na rayne, Na muffis for na wedderis vngayne Off nakyne stormys þat may fall; The watter of Nyle oure fletis it all With spring of self withoutin spait, Quhen Egipt nedis to be wait. The land of Thebes in it lyis, And of it lord wes Sanct Mawryss; Bot Cadmus, þe sone of Edmore, Maid a cete þare before. Nest Thebes lyis wildernes Quhare mony monkis quhilum wes. Thare Cambyses, a king of mycht, That Egipt wane throuch forss of fycht, Maid in Egipt a cete And Babilone it callit he. Syne Alexander þe conquerour Maid Alexandre of gret honour. Be north þire landis reknyt þus Standis þe hill of Calkasus, One est half fra þe Egipt se, Sa rynnand in till summytie, North half to Europ marchand neire, Quhare Amasons wonnand were, That women were full wild and wycht, And vsit ay armyne to fycht, And in all press were sterne and stout, To fecht with men þai had na dout. With þaim wes nacionis wonnand seire, That spedis nocht to rekyne heire, Off Calkos and of Sarw þai, Off Mathess and vthire ma. In to þat est þare is a hill, Seris þat nane is gevin þartill, Syne sa wes callit þat cuntre; Off silkyne claith þare is plente. The land of Bakka lyis it by, And till it marchis Yrkany; Thare foullis are sa faire and brycht, Thare fetheris schynis all þe nycht. Nixt it lyis marchand Sythia, Till a cuntre callit Hynnya, With seire nacionis fourty and foure, Quha sekis þat cuntre all attoure. Thare is alsua hillis hie That Callabyre now call we; Syne lyis þe land of Albany, That quhit betaknys properly; For þe folkis duelland þarin Ar quhit of hew baith cheke and chyne. Nixt lyis þe landis of Armeny, With Arrarait þe hill þarby; Thare Noyis arche on ground stude Quhen all swagit wes þe flude. Nixt lyis a land callit Yvory, And Capados marchis it by. Without stalonys þe meris þare And bot of wynd consewand are; Bot þai horss oure ?eris thre Happinis nocht liffand for to be, And þis ferly is for to heire. Agloith þat tretis of þis matere Sayis þare is in to þat land A gret watter on heid rynnand, Deip and reich, bot nocht full wyde, With bankis hie one ather syde; And one þe ta syde of þat flude The stode horss gais in pasture gud, And one þe toþer syde day and nycht The meris gais in to þar sycht; Bot þai may nocht be nakyne way Meit togidder þame to play. Than wild and wod for þai meris Waxis þai capillis of wantone feris, And fra þaim sa haboundandly There kynd eschapis fervently And sa stark is þe flewoure That it raikis þe ryvere oure, And in þai meris entre tais, That baggit gret with foall þaim mais, And folit syne all qwic gangand, Bot þai are na thing lang lestand. Syne lyis a cuntre þarabout That Less Asye is callit, but dout; There Ephesone þe faire cete Amasonis gert biggit be. Now men vsis it to call Haltyloge in landis all. Sanct Iohne þe ewangelist þare lyis, That plesit to God in all seruice. The first land of Less Asya Is callit þe Maire Frigia; First Weryk, syne Mygdony, Bytinia and Mare Frigy. There is a cete of gret fame, That Nycia hes to name; In it a solempne sen?e wes sene, Thre hundreth bischopis and auchtene; Befor Sanct Siluester þe paip, Revestit in surpless and caip, Thare wes expoundit full clerely The treuth þat Cristin men liffis by. Thare is a cete callit Smerna, And nixt it lyis Galacia; Syne lyis þe landis of Turky, That first wes callit þe Less Frigy. Schir Dardanus gat efter it call Dardanya þat lordschip all; Syne Thergyus, king of gret pouste, Gert Troy ryall biggit be About a hill within þe toune, The quhilk wes callit Ylioune. Nixt it þe landis lyis by Off Libane and of Barbory; Thare rynnis a rever callit Ernes, That famouss is and of gret riches, For in þe sand besid þat flude Off fyne gold þare is plente gud. Nixt lyis þe landis of Lydis haill, Tyatyra it hecht but faill, That of Lydis is þe cete, And cheif of all þat land suld be. Nixt it lyis Ysodora, Off wynd or rayne it callit is sa, For cleire and pure þare is þe aire; It hecht Ysodora þe faire. Nixt it lyis Syluia; Thare is a hill hecht Hamana, That sum vsis to call Tawrus; Nixt it a cete hecht Tarsus, Thare þe appostill Paull oft prechit The Cristin treuth quhen he þaim techit. Nixt lyis a land callit Lycia, Syne Sydone and Panphilia, Syne Pwns, þat is a regioun Off mony sindry nacioun Liffand apoun diuerss wiss, Be þar lawis and þar frawncess. Thare Ovide and Sanct Clement syne Were exild to be put to pyne. Now haue ye herd me rycht schortly Oure haill þe landis of Asye, That till Seme and his lynage Grew and fell in heretage, And þe tane half is of þe thre Off þe roundaill, as herd haif ?e. Fra þe south it bakwart strekis To þe north quhill at it rekis The north art, as I fynd in writt; One richt half is þe west of it, The left half leiffis at Affrica, And þe west at Europa, And it beltis neire all about One thre halfis þe sea without. CHAPTER XII. Heir may ye wit trewly to tell To quham þe kinrik of Affrik fell. Off Abrahamys posterite Afore, þai say, suld cummyng be. He wes a man of ryall fame, Off him all Affrik has þe name; Men sayis it wes of sic degre It thrid part of þe erd suld be, Quhare all þe landis of Affrik lyis, The south alhaill it occupiis. The water of Ynd, as sais þe writt, One est half is þe marche of it, And at þe west of it suld be The strait of Narrok in to Span?e, Wnto þe cete of Gadess, Neire þe pillaris of Herculess, Within ane ile in to þe se Thai set ware at may knawin be. Gades now, þat cete fyne, Is callit þe Sept of Balmaryne. A gret land is callit Liby Lyis in till Affrik halely; Pontapolus nixt lyis syne, There v. ceteis ar fundin fyne. Off Tripille syne þe gret cuntre Nixt hand marchis all thre, And syne þe kinrik of Cartage That Dido aucht of heretage. The wallis of it of breid about Wes xviii. cubitis braid but dout. Syne is þe land of Tessaly, Nixt it is lyand Nyvydy, With Ypyone þe cete fyne; Off it wes bischop Sanct Augustyne. Nixt lyis a land hecht Mawrytane, Towart þe sowth is lyand syne Ethiopes, a cite fyne, And Saba, and of þat cite Wes quene Sibill þat come to se King Salamone in till his dais, As þe buke of Kingis sais. This Ethiops lyis to þe est, The gret Ethiope to þe west. Thare is a well of watter cleire, Bot þare is nane dare neigh it neire; All þe nycht it is sa hait, Syne turnys it in ane oþer stait, And is sa cald apone þe day That man na best drink it na may. In Ethiope or by it neire Throuch speid of fut sum tais þe deire; Tragidytyis þai vse to call Thai folkis in þare langage all. Be?ond all Ethiope but less Lyis mekle land in wilderness, Quhare na man dare repaire na duell For hete of sone and edderis fell; As a caldrone þare þai say For hete of sone þe se will play. Now haif I tald yow schortly The landis of Affrik how þai ly, That to Cain and his lynage Fell and grew in heretage. Till Europe I will turne my stile And þarof will I speik a quhile. CHAPTER XIII. How mony landis ar in Europe And quha foundit first Rome our hope. The landis þat in Europe lyis The north art all occupiis. In to the north of Europe is A revere þat hecht Tannais, Quhare þare standis hillis hie That hecht þe hillis of Raphay, And fra þe watter of Tannais South one to Danay strekand is A land callit Nethere Sythia; Wnder Sythy lyis in Asya, And till it is marchand nere, Albeid þai ly in parteis seire, Forthy sum haldis þat baith þai Suld be bot a Sythia. In it is lyand halely Lectow land and Albany, Gotland als and Dacia; Thire lyis in Nythere Sythia. Fra þe watter of Danaye Till Alpes, that ar hillis hie Departand Ytaly fra France, Be marche, metis and distance, Lyis Ducheland all halely, That callit wes Vuer Germany. Germany in properte Berowing may callit be; For þare men in gret multitud Sa growis of forme and fassoune gud; Therfor men vsis properly To call þat land ay Germany; Almayne þai vse it now to call. Sawyne lyis in till it all, West vp one þe watter of Ryne; One north half it is rynnand syne A watter callit Alwyus. In Wngary springis Danubyus, That I now call Danuby, With water is ekit haill sexty; Bot þai are rynnand to and fra In diuerss partiis devisit sa; At Ponsus it enteris in þe se Out of Asye in þat cuntre. In Almanye in Baweyre, Espowne, Ostrike, France, Turone, Saxone; Syne Nethire Germany of ane Strekand north in þe Occiane. And in þis Nethire Germany All Norway lyis halely; And sum men sais Demark alsua, And vthire sum sais in Sythia. And fra Danoe þat gret ryvere All about it lyis newyre A land men callis Messia; For plente gret men callis it sa Off corne þat is haboundand. It lyis est one ay strekand Merchiand with þe Mekle Se. Off Beyne, þat is a gret cuntre, It merchis north with Pannony, That lyis neire on Vngary. Syne lyis a land callit Trasya, Tyras it aucht and callit it sa; And in it rynnis þe ryvere That in auld tyme wes callit Ybere. In it alsua is þe cete That Constantinople now call we. The land of Sythyine halely That Grece is callit now commonely Fra þe neyre Medyterane It lyis south to þe Occiane, That is þe mekle se without, Beltand all þe erd about; And þe erd may wele be Callit ane ile within þe se. In Europe lyis Dalmachia Cypere and Callibria, Melos land and Glady, Actyke, Attenys and Boesy. Cadmus, þe sone of Athenore, That Thebes in Asy maid befor, Gert þat Boesy biggit be And Thebes Gret it callit he. The men of Thebes in Asye Ar callit in Latyne Thebey. Thebany þai vse to call In to Grece þe Thebes all. In Grece is Pelops and Thessaly, And Macedone all halely; Olumphus als, þe hill on hicht, That passis þe cloudis evin richt; Thessaloneke and Achaye, Corinthe and Archade, all thre, That callit wes befor Sithione. Thare is a stane hecht albestone That one na wiss may sloknyt be Fra anys in fyre men may it se. Syne lyis Vthire Pannony Till Appenyne þe hillis hie. One north half rynnis þe revere That sum tyme hattyne wes Hester; Bot now men vsis it to call Danos þat revere oure all. Men vsit to call Ytaly Mekill Grew all halely; It rysis at þe hillis hie And haldis one to þe Mekle Se. It has names changeit sindry, Bot ?it it is callit Ytaly. Thare Romulus gert Rome be maid, That fassone of a lyoune had, In takyne þat it suld souerane be Oure all landis, as ?e se, The lyoune haiffand þe sen?eory Off all bestis liffand him by; For in till auld tyme men þat maid Citeis ay in custom had All like to bestis þaim to may, And þis Rome is ane of þai Thare wes maid as in fassoune, As I said, like till a lyoune. Brundis like ane hert wes maid, And Cartage als þe fassioune had Off ane oxe, and Troye was Maid till a horss in to liknes. Thire tovnis all þe fassioune had Off þire bestis and wes maid Like to þame in all degre, As þe makaris had daynte Off þai bestis and delite Be freyt or oiss, or ellis profite. Neir Ytaly lyis Tuskane; Syne lyis a land callit Champane, And þe land of Pole þarby; Syne all þe landis of Lumbardy, With mony gret ceteis and faire, Haboundand in riches and repaire. At þai Alpes þai say syne The heid is of þe watter of Ryne. Fra þin þai say suld lyand be South on strekand to þe se The realme of France till Occiane; Be west it lyand apone Rone, Be south it lyand is Narbone, With Aurely, þe faire cete, And merchiand with it suld be Towart þe west all Equitane, That we vse now to call Gyane. That land þai say is lyand faire Strekand by þe watter of Lair. Syne lyand is þe land of Spane, As betuix it and Brettane, Departand baith þai landis þare Seueraly as þai lyand are. CHAPTER XIV. Off braid Bertane and þat lynage To quham it fell in heretage. Blessit Bertane beild suld be Off all the ilis of þe se, Quhare flouris ar feill and feildis faire, Haill of hew, hailsome of aire. Off all cornys þare is copy gret, Of pess, of atis, beire and quhete, Of frute of tre, of fische in flude, And to all bestis pastoryne gude. Siluius sais in Brettany Sum stedis growis sa haboundanely Off gerss, bot sumtyme þat þar fee Fra fylth of fude refren?eit be, The fude sall turne þaim to perile, To brest or rot, or deid sum quhile. There wyld in wod has welth at will, That hyrdis hydis holme and hill, And bewis bowis all for byrth, And merllis and mavisss melis of myrth. Thare hunting is at alkyne deire, And ryall halking on ryvere, And fisching þare is haboundance, And all gud to manis sustynance. One est half it lyis Germany And all Denmark all halely; One west half Brettany is lyand Alhaill þe landis of Irland. Bot wrakis sindry has ourtane Off Goddis liking þis Brettane: Quhen Pichtis werrayit it stoutly And wan of it a gret party; And syne þe Romanis tribut gat Off Brettane, and syne efter þat The Saxonis all Ingland haill Wan and had þe gouernaill. Syne þare Denmark werrayit fast, Bot ?it þai tynt it at þe last. The Normundis efter wan Ingland And þare in lordis ?it regnand. Off langage in Brettane seire I fynd þat five sumtyme were: Bretis speich and Ingliss syne, Pichtis, Scottis and Latyne; Bot of þe Pightis is ferly That þai ar vndone sa halely That noþer remanis no langage Na successioun of þar lynage; And sa of þare antiquite Is like a fabill for to be. On west half Brettane is lyand All þe landis of Irland; That is a land of nobill aire, Off floure, of froit, of feildis faire, Quhare nakyne best of venome may Lest or lif attour a day; Ass ask, edder, snaik or taid, Supposs þat þai be hidder had. On north half Brettane in certaynte Lyis þe Out Ilis in þe se; And of þai are thre principall, Supposs þare be ma in þe haill. Orknay of þaim ane call we, Thy Yle of Mayne syne in þe se, Betuix Irland and Brettane, Anentis Normundy or Spayne. Sum sais Schetland is þe thrid Betuix Orknay and Noroway kyd. ?it ma ylis on þat see Withoutin þare may funding be; ?it in þat see þare is ane ile That in till ald tyme wes hatyne Tyle. Thare sex monethis of þe ?ere, That we hald for somere heire, Thare foroutyne nycht is day; And þe sex monethis of winter ay Within þat isle is ythand nycht, Withoutin ony dais licht. Be north þat may nane erd be Fundin bot þe mekle se. All þire landis as þai ly I haif oure halit now lichtly. Bot all Europe in heretage To Iaphet fell and his lynage. He wes þe ?oungest of þe thre Sonnyis gottin throuch Noye; The eldest sone of þis Iaphet Wes Gomor þat gat Ragaeth; And þat Ragaeth efter þat Ysrawe þane Esraw gat, And syne Esraw gat Iara And fader wes syne of Array, And syne be lyne evin descendand That to reherss were taryand, Till Phymes-Forss in þat quhile Gat a sone wes callit Newile, And þis ilk Newill efter þat To sone Gadeill-Glais gat, That had weddit Scota ?ing, Pharois dochter of Egipt king. CHAPTER XV. Off þe gret tour of Babilone And of þare langage þe confusioun. Cain, the myddill of the thre Sonnys gottin of Noe, Gat a sone wes callit Cus, That gat Menbroid and Helibus. This Menbroid stalwart wes of pyth And wicht man he wes þarwith. He wes þe first þat ?arnyt till haif Sen?eory attour þe laif That lyfand were in land him by; And of his ordinance suthly Babelle þe toure biggit wes, That had of hicht foure thousand pass, In to the feild of Sennaor, Quhare þat mony gaderit ware. Off set purposs to wyne þaim name, To hie þar price, þar stait and þar fame, Thai thocht a cete for to ma, A toure within it hecht alsua, To clyme vp to þe aire quhen þai Sic mastry likit till assay. And þis purposs þai did in deid, And ay wes wirkand with gud speid, Ay till it happinnit at þe last, As þai were wirkand all þire fast, Thare speche changeit all sodanely, And ilkane spak sa sindrely That nane couth vþer vnderstand, As þai on oþer were blaberand. Comestor sais in þis changeing God maid na wit na vncouth thing; For diuersite of seire langage As to heire vncouth and sawage. Quhare he tellis God gaif na wyte In þis changeing, as he did it To þe Apostlis on Witsonday. This signifyis þat [ill] folkis ay Ar apt ay to confusioune, And gud folkis to saluatioun, As be þire Babilonis wes sein, That were provd and of lif vnclene; And for þare changeing of toungis seire, As I rehersit forouth heire. Thai sessit þan of þare bigging, For þai mycht nocht bring it to ending, Thare purposs na þare ill entent, Thai had sa sudane impedyment, Quhare of ilk man thocht gret ferly That þai were changeit sa sodanely That nane ane vþer vnderstude; And will of wane fra þat þai ?ude, Devisit oure all in landis seire, And þus all langage changeit were. CHAPTER XVI. Off Nemprod and of his rysing And of seire pohetis and þar liffing. Autouris seire in þare storyis Haldis opinionis on seire wiss, And þis Menprod, þe sone of Cuss, Frere Martyne callis him Seturnus; Pullux sone sum sais he was; Sum fen?eis he wes faderles, And na souerane autour him had, And all þe warld of gold he maid. The poetis callit him creatour Off all þat þai did to honour, And Pluto, Iubiter and Bachus, Neptune, Mars and Eolus, Off batall, wynd, wyne and se, Off thire foure þire goddis suld be. And þis ?it þire poetis fen?eit mare Off þis Saturnus we spak of aire That fra he wist be werd þat he Throuch his sone suld geldit be, Nemprod, þat wes fell and provd, That wes þe first maid vnderlowd, This Saturnus chargit his wif That scho suld haif payne of her lif Quhat byrth scho baire of hir body Bring it befor him hastely, And in his sicht scho suld it set; For that, he said, suld be his mete, Sa one his barnis he suld be wrokin, That þat werde suld all be brokin. Than Pluto first hir hapnit to beire, And of him quhen scho woxe lichtere Scho gert him haif his fader to, To se of him quhat he wald do. Than Saturnus dalf him in þe erd, And sa fal?eit in him þe werd; For þi þe god of erd or hell Pohetis callit him in þare spell. Off Neptune neist scho wes lichtare, And scho him till his fader baire, And he him swakit in þe se; Tharfor þai fen?eit þat god is he. And fra scho herd þis fellony done, To Pluto first and syne Neptune, Scho leit till him scho had na ma Off barnis þat scho baire efter þai. Syne to sone scho baire Pynus, That fader wes to Sereuyus, And his sone wes callit Latyne, That of Ytaly lord wes syne; And þis Latyne þe first wes he Gert þat langage spokin be. The ferd sone scho hapnit to beire Wes callit to name Iupiter; This Iubiter all prevely Scho gert be fosterit tenderly, Till he wes passit all ?outhheid And storkynnit in stout manheid. Aganis his fader yrusly He raiss and in to fellony, And maid him so felloune chace, Persewand him fra place to place, Quhill Saturnus for saufte Fled in ane yle callit Crete; And þare his sone followit sa fast Quhill he him tuke þare at þe last, And presonyt him lang tyme in to pyne, And tyt fra him his lomys syne, And gert swak þaim out in þe se; Wenus þerof suld cummyng be, Thire pohetis sais in þar fen?eing, Bot it is nocht all suthfast thing; Men may wit full veraly That þis is nocht to trow trewly, For in þe articlis of þe Creid Is nocht of þis, withoutin dreid. Thai hald alsua þis Venus wes Off luf lady and goddess Off all faireheid, and forthy All þai þat luffit perdrury Maid till hire þare sacrifice And worschippit hir in hir seruice Propirly, as scho suld be All þare hope, hap and saufte. Thare efter fra þat Saturnus, As ?e haue herd, wes geldit thus, He buskit of þat land to ga, That his sone suld nocht him sla, Nor do him mare wa nor dispite; He gat in till a galay tyte, And past to see sa prevely That he gat in till Ytaly, And þare he closit his last day. Pohetis of him na mare coit say, Bot at he wes outh þaim set, To be regnand as a planet, His courss halding be him self In ilkane of þe takinnis twelf Sex monethis and twa yeris Fra he entyr in Signifere, Till xxx. wynter be oure tane, Or he be quytly all oure gane The ?odiak, þat we quheill call, For þat it beris þe signis all, Sayis in his courss his violens, And weire and derth and pestilens; Sa is mankynd in gret dout Till he his courss haif all maid out. Wnder þis Saturne, as Ovide sais, That maid þe warld in till his dais Off [gold], all stait wes innocent, Withoutin pleid or iugisment. He gat nouþer gerss nor tre In his dayis doune hewin be; Thare birth but thret þai vsit to beire; Thare wes na wy þat wist of weire, Than wes na schip to saill on se, As craar, craik or ?it galee; Na ?it na cuntre mair plesand Till man þat tyme na his awne land; Best and bird and fische in flude Had at þare choiss all liking gud. The lady þat tyme Dame Nature Led be hir rewill all creature, And quhen þis Saturnus wes deid His sone þat raiss in till his steid Saw þis gold of kynd sa brycht All disesful till his sicht; Wp þat gold he tuke away, And he þat warld maid in his day Off quhit siluer, þat wes were Metall þan þe gold be fer. He gert bestis vnder ?oke Thole broddis saire and mony knoke. He gert first men mak bigging And vse in housss þar duelling. Horss he gert baith drug and draw, And men be kend till eire and saw; Gosshalk he dayntit and falcons To tak baith boytouris and heronis. And quhen þis Iupiter wes deid, He þat succedit in his steid Baith gold and siluer he gert hyde, That ?it lyis hurdit to þis tyde, And all þe warld he maid of brass, That were na gold or siluer wass. Than wes all stait of mare dourenes Than ony tyme befor it wes. The werst generatioun The ferd wes in successioun; Quhen that pohete his powere had Off irne all þe warld he maid. Ovide sais in to þat quhile Vpraiss falsheid, swik and gile, Thift and reif and all quayntiss, And bernand luf of cuvatyss. The gest at ?arnyt weill to faire Mycht nocht be sicker of his ostlare; Na þe maygh coit nocht be In pess with his alye; And oftsyss þe ta broþer Wald of weire be with þe toþer; The fader trowit þat þe sone Wald for his landis his dayis were done. CHAPTER XVII. Off Nynus king and frelage That he gert do till ane ymage. Ane in auld tyme callit Benus, That fader were to Nynus, That wes king of Assyry, His fader he luffit sa tenderly That quhen he deit him befor, For till haue of him memor, All like his fader in figure Ane ymage he maid in faire payntour; That payntit ymage with colouris fyne, In opyne he gert set syne, Quhare comoune hant wes of repaire, For to behald þat figure faire, And gert oure all his lordschip cry Quha to þat ymage deuotly Wald cum for gyrth or ?it saufte, That nane suld sa hardy be Him to distruble, tak or sla, Or ony mannance till him ma, For ony myss þat he had done, Bot þare he suld haue succour sone, Till þai within þe presens were Off þat god of gret powere; Othire be þis ensample syne Off noble mater and of fyne, Off þare freyndis þat were deid Set up sic figuris in þare steid, And gert do þaim sic honour As þai had bene þar creatour. Sum þai callit Bell of Baliall, Sum Bel?ebub, sum Baall; And þus began first ydolatry That we vse to call mawmentry. CHAPTER XVIII. Quha foundit first Ierusalem And sa þe first buke endis þe teme. [Y]it suld I tell a genology Off Sem discendand lynaly, Gif þat I suld my mater bring And my purposs till ending. In till þe tyme I spak of thus Semys sone Pedagyus Gat a sone wes callit Tubale, That syne wes fader till Adrale; The quhilk gat Sterenoneus, That fader wes of Ermodeus, And his sone wes callit Stealsy, That fader wes of Stealdy, His sone borne gat Cetius, That fader wes to Gecius; Goddulfus efter him gat syne A sone and fader to Fealfyne; Fredwald gat efter Woden; He fader wes of mony men. Bot Semys sone Arphaxat Gat Caynane, that Heber gat; This Caynane wes callit Sale; Ierusalem first foundit he That first aucht Ynd and Samary, And vthir seire landis þarby. Eber efter gat Phaleke; In his tyme men begouth to speke In till mony toungis seire, As efter þat þai changeit were, How Hebrew langage þat tyme left To Phalexis [lynage] lang þareft. In his tyme begouth mawmentry, That clerkis callis ydolatry. Phalek þe fader wes of Raw, Sum vsit to call him Regaw; In to the tyme þat þis Raw was Off Sythy first þe cuntre raiss. This Raew to sone Sadeth gat; Off him come Nacor efter þat. In þis Raewis tyme enone Off Assyry and Sythione The kinrikis raiss in ryalte. Off þis Nascor come Thare; Babilone in to his dais Wes biggit, as þe story sais. Off þis Thare efter þat Come Ysaac þat Abrahame gat. Heir þe secund eild takis end, As þe Hebrewis makis it kend; It contenit is ?ere be ?ere A thousand and twa hundreth ?ere, And twa and twenty ?eris but mare; Bot to þis discordand are The sevinty wiss interpretouris, For, as we fynd in þare scriptouris, A thousand sevinty ?eris and sevin The secund eild contenis evin. CHAPTER XIX. The autour weill declaris heire Throuch quham seire datis wes in weire. Now haue ye herd vpon quhat wiss I haue contenit þis tretiss, Fra first formyt wes Adam Till þis tyme now of Habrahame, And baith þe eildis has tane end, As in auld storyis is weill kend, Contynewand haill thre thousand ?ere Nyne score and foure oure passit heire; The quhilkis, as Orosyus In till his corniklis tellis ws, Nere for?et wes reklesly, Or þan mysknawin all vterly With þaim þat set all þar delite Befor þaim storyis for to write. [Fra] Habrahame and Nynus king All storyis takis þar begynnyng, As Pompeyus and Iustyne, Orosyus tellis and Frere Martyne. Now þarfor in to certane terme This tretiss furth I will afferme, Haldand tyme be tyme þe dait As Orosyus sumtyme wrait; And of þai storyis þan will I Compile þat me think mast likly Vnto þe tyme þat efter fell Quhen Iugis iugit Israell, Till oure mater accordand, And till your hering mast plesand. Bot with Orosyus we sall discord In till our dait quhen we record Befor or fra þe byrgh of God, Reknand ?eris evin or od; Befor or fra þan reknys he That of Rome maid wes þe cete. CHAPTER XX. Off Nynus slauchter and his ending And of þe bruttis begynnyng. Befor þat Ihesu Crist wes borne To sauf mankynd þat wes forlorne, Twa thousand haill and fyfty ?ere, And twa ?eris oure to rekin cleire, Nynus, þe king of Assyry, In lust of lordschip and fellony Tuke vp armis to verray Seire folkis þat about him lay. All Assye throuch his cruelte With weire and batall dantit he. Fifty ?eris his lif he led And mekle of saikles blude he sched; All þe landis of Sythy And vthire nacionis þare sindry, That vsit to lif bot sympill lif, Withoutin batall, weire or strife, And laith wes batall for to mufe, Or in to weire þar pith to prufe. Sic lif he lerit þaim to leid That blude of men in slauch and weid Thai vsit to drink mare commonly Than mylk of scheip, or gait, or ky. To vincuss folk he kennit sa fast That he wes vincust at þe last. Cam, þat callit was ?orestas, And king of Bactrianus was, And fyndare first of nygramansy, Off wichecraft and of sossery, First he supprisit with his mycht, And slew him syne throuch forss in fecht. It happinnit efter one a day, As he about a cete lay In till a sege as man of weire, Assal?eand it with his powere, Sic assawtis þare he maid That neire þe tovne he wonyn had; Ane archere in ane cornere stude, That wele beheld quhare Nynus ?ude. This archere had in hand a bow, Tharin he set a scharp arow That to þe hukis vp he drew, And with þat schot he Nynus slew. Than Symyramys, þat wes his wif, That led in liking all her lif, In till hir chalmer þan sittand, Hir haire in wymple arrayand, Quhen þat scho herd of þis cace, Supposs in hert scho sary wes, The tane half of hir haire vnplet, Scho gert plat on hir basnet With oþer armyne gud and fyne, And lap apone a coursoure syne, And to þe toune, but mair abaid, Arrayit with hir ost scho raid, And gert þaim mak þare at assawt Foroutin fal?eing or defalt, Quhill þat scho wonyn had þe tovne, And brocht it to confusioune. Fra tyme hir lust stud halely In slauchter and in lichory. Fourty ?eris scho liffit sa, And wayndit na mare for to sla Him þat scho gert ly hir by Than him þat wes hir innemy, Quhat tyme þat hir liking stude, And ?arnyng had to se his blude. Off chalmere play wes scho [neuer] sad, For all þe copy þat scho had; Scho gert oure all hir landis cry And ordanit be statut semely That all þat wald in liking lif, And till all lustis þare bodyis gif, Thai suld in all thingis be als fre As it mycht likand to þaim be, To sibrend haiffand na knawlage Or but reuerens of mariage. In all scho pruffit man, Supposs in forme scho wes woman. All Ethiope scho wan but dout, And maid it till hir vnderlout. Scho past in Ynd in plane bataill, Quhare nane befor hir durst assaill, Na efter hir with force to ficht, Bot Alexandere, þat with his mycht Wan Meide and Perse and Ynde alsua, And all þe landis of Asya. Bot þis Ynde in till hir tyme wes were To wyne þan efter hir befer, For of nakyng weire without Na within þai had na dout Off invy, na cuvatiss, Na falsheid þat þaim mycht suppriss. Bot scho liffit in tyrandry, Off gouernance scho wes happy, And richt awysy ay in weire, And couth weill se for hir effeire. Hir landis lyand hir about Scho stuffit weill for alkin dout, And gert þaim wele replenist be With horss and nolt and vthir fee, With wyne and walx, oyle and quhete; And all tymes scho had copy grete Off froyt þat grew on erd and tre; Thareof scho had all tyme plente. Scho gert men thraly set þare [cure] Corne to wyne with þare culture; And of Babilone baith toure and tovne Scho maid þe reformatioun, And gert gyrnall it perfitly And battall it full prevely, And drew in till it merchandiss, To by and sell on sindry wiss, And held in till it craftis seire, That nedis not to be reknyt heire. Amangis all vþeris commonely Scho hir avne sone gert by hir ly; Sua anis as scho come him till Her fleschly lust for to fulfill, Prevaly he gat a knyf, With þat fra hire he reft þe lif. All þus scho endit in to trespas; Hir sone succedit Nynyas, The sone and aire of Nynus king, And had þat land in gouernyng; And efter him of his lynag Succedit to þat heretag Xiiij. airis sindrely, Be lyne discendand evinlily, Befor þat lordschip wes vndone, As ?e may heire efter þis sone. This Nynus had a sone alsua, Schire Dardane, lord of Frigia, Fra quham maister Iohne Barbour, That mekle couth of þis labour, Translatit weill and propirly Fra þis Dardane a genology Till Robert Stewart oure secund king, That Scotland had in gouernyng. That paganys left in þare storiis That is bot fable or fantasiis, That Iubiter gat one Electra Schire Dardane lord of Frigidia. To tell ?ow mare of þat story Wald as now do bot occupy Tyme, and wald furthire nocht Purposs þat suld till end be brocht. CHAPTER XXI. Off Abrahamys posterite Heir may ?e fynd gif ?e will se. Twa thousand ?eris and tene beforne That Crist wes of þe madin borne, Quhen þat xl. ?eris and ane Fra Nynus raiss wes fully gane, Than ane followand þe nixt ?ere Off Abraham quham ?e now sall heire Wes borne, and þan ane wes he Off þe sonnys gottin throuch Thare. This Abraham liffit ay vertuously; For thy God blessit him specialy. In till his tyme he fand of new To writt letere? of Hebrew, For þe bukis þat Enoke wrait Drownyt all in Noyis spait. He kennyt þe Caldeis perfitly The science of astronomy; He gaif first in till his dayis Teyndis, as þe Bibill sayis, To Melchisedech, þat þan had The souerane ordoure of preistheid, That offerit till Abraham breid and wyne, That blessit him directly syne, Quhen þat he come hame agane Fra þat þe kingis foure were slane, Quhare þat Lothe reskewit he With all his gudis and his men?e. He kennyt Egiptis wisly The science of geometry; The circumcisioun first tuke he And, as we fynd, in Iubile First in his tyme funding was, That we call now þe ?ere of grace. A sone he gat apone Sarray, That Ysaac wes callit verray. A hundere ?eris quhen he wes auld And sevinty to þe gaist he ?ald, Quhen all his dayis fulfillit was In gud eild and in rychttuissnes. Isaac weddit Rebecca, And one hir he gat sonnis twa; Esaw wes callit þe eldest, And luffit wes with þe fader best; Iacob callit wes þe toþer, Off byrth he wes þe youngest broþer; Atanis þe moder deliuer was Off þame baith in till schort space. In hunting Esaw had delite, Iacob set him all for profitt Off corne and catell and of fee, Quharewith he mycht sustenit be. Fra hunting Esaw all wery Come one a day, and richt hungry He wes, and of potage wes maid To Iacobis dynere wald haue had; For quhy him thocht it ane hard thraw, Hungyre in till hungry maw; And Iacob warnyt vtraly Bot gif he sald him halely All his avantage and degre That to þe eldest sone suld be. Than Esaw foroutin mare let, For hungyre at he wes in set, For a dischefull of þai potage Gaif him vp all his heretage. Thus Iacob wane þe eldest gre, Thocht ?oungest in þe byrth wes he. Syne how þis Iacob stelely Prevenyt his broþer and quayntly, Quhen throuch his moderis suggestioun He wan his faderis benysoune, And how syne of þire breþer twa Iow and Gentill come alsua, Than Gentill wes all generaly That come nocht discendand lynyaly Fra Iacob be successioun, Na of his generacioun. Iowis fra þi ar in þat degre That Cristin men now in ?e se. This Iacob wes callit Israell Fra with him werstlit þe angell, As in þe Bibyll writtin is, In to þe buke of Genesis. This Iacob one his wiffis twa, Rachaell callit and Lya, Gat xii. sonnys, and Iudas Ane of þai xii. sonnis was. Thire xii., þat I now of tell, The tribus were of Israel, Off quham come oure sueit Lady, Goddis moder, sanct Mary. Tribus may be þe ymage Properly callit in oure langage. Thire xii. tribus in possessioun The land of repromissioun Wes hecht, bot þai it tynt throuch syne, That Cristin men throuch grace sall wyne. Innacus in Nyale In till þis tyme gat Pha?one. He wes þe first þat in his dawis Ordanit in to Greece his lawis, And befor iugis ordanit he Be pleid caussis mot to be. He ordanit þe iugis set To be in to þe plane merket. Ysis, þat wes his sister, syne In Egipt past be nawyne, And þare scho kennyt þaim letterature, And to wyne corne with þar culture; For þai said þat scho þan wes Amangis þare goddis a goddess. Apis þai say at he suld be A sone of this Pharone. He passit þe se till Egipt wan Quhare þai say he wes weddit man To þis woman callit Ysis, And god wes callit with þar goddis, And Sarapis wes efter calld; And I fynd in to storyis tald The madyn þat tyme Mynerwa Besyde a loge in Affrica Wes funding, with craftis seire Thame kend be werk and be manere. The wemen þat tyme of þat land Scho gert þaim leire to be wirkand, And maist in woll to kem and spyne, And claith weif to cleith folkis in. This Mynerua þat þan wes Efter þat wes callit Pallas. In Trace kinrik in ane ile Thare in scho fosterit wes a quhile And as scho slane had a gyand That to name hattyne wes Palland, For þi Pallas wes hir name, That madyne of sa Ryall fame. CHAPTER XXII. How first þe Ile of þe Rodis was Inhabit and syne priuiliege has. A thousand and sex hundreth ?ere And foure score, foure less but were, Befor þe Incarnatioun That causit oure saluatioun A folkis þat wes callit Achises, And Carentenys þat with þaim wes, Raiss agane þis Pharone, Off Argos þat tyme king wes he. He had in till his cumpany A folk wes callit Percasy; The landis þan of Grece alhaill, Supposs þe lordschippis be seuerall. Thire Alchiss vincust in fecht Behuffit of neid to ta þe flicht, Fra press of folkis to hald þaim fre, In rest and pess liffand to be. The Ile of Rodis þan tuke þai And it inhabit fra þat day, Be þame and þare successioun, For Crist has fre possessioun. CHAPTER XXIII. How Ioseph wes in Egipt sald, And how all thing ?eid as he wald. A thousand and vii? ?ere And ane and sexty þarto cleire Befor þe blest Natiuite, In Egipt þe gret plentuosite Begouth to ryss in Iosephis dais, As in þe cornyklis Orosyus sais, Sevin ?eris all out contenand, With vþer sevin nixt followand Off deth and als of hungir seire, The quhilkis anoyit þe peple þare, Na were Ioseph, þat throuch his wit Throuch Goddis grace saw help for it. Iacobis sone þis Ioseph was, Perfite and of sic cunnandnes That he couth weill baith ken and se Quhat land suld barand and gud be. He wes þe first þat dremys red That men saw slepand in þare bed, And of sic mysty visionis He maid clere exposicionis. This tene breþer him forthy Sauld to strange merchandis for invy, That had him in till Egipt þan; Thare he become a princes man, That held him into gret daynte, And put all gudis in his pouste. His brethire þan þat had him sald, As I forouth þis to ?ow tald, Slew a kyd and in þe blude Wet his govne þat he in ?ude, And gert his fader be þat ken That wolffis had him weryit þen; And for his passand hie bewte With þe prince? luffit wes he. Fra scho of him a sicht had sene, Scho kest till him hir luf vnclene, And wald haif gert him by hir ly, Bot he refusit hir foly, For the honour of his lard, That put all gudis in his ward; Bot anerely his wiff but weyne, Quhen scho hir saw forsakyne clene, As a fals woman and fell Scho rarit lovd vp with a ?ell, And said Ioseph wald haue lyne hir by And bownyt him þarto besely. Than wes he put in deep presoune Quhill King Pharois visioun That he saw slepand in his bed, That nane couþ þan bot Ioseph red; He tald him be his dremyne all How þat xiiii. ?eris suld fall. Than maid Ioseph of all his land Prince, stewart and luftenand; He gert þat sevin ?ere gaderit be Alkyne corne in sic plente That in till tyme of hungire saire The folkis þarwith refreschit ware, And vthir mony cuntreis seire Till Egipt þat tyme sekand were To by wictalis to þare fude. Thus Ioseph throuch his vertu gud Stuffit his lord weill of monee, And als þe folkis refreschit he; And throuch his forsycht þat wes wyss Off Egipt all þe tenandriis He redemyt þame agane, And maid to þe king domayne; And syne in husbandry for ferme Ilka ?ere at certane terme He set þai landis and þe maill, The fyft part of þare wynnyng haill Ilk ?ere in to certane, At termis to þe king wes tane; And in till Egipt ?it þai say That vyss is kepit to þis day. And for sic vertu as he pruffit Soueranely þe king him luffit, And gaif him haill þe full powere To do þat likand to him were. His brethire þare come till him als, That for invy and counsall fals For dremys þat he vndid and tald To strange merchandis þai him sald. Thai come for to by wittaill þare, For in gret poynt of hunger þai were, For kenning of him had þai nane, And he þaim kend weill euer ilkane, And threpit on þaim þai were spyis And to the cuntre innemyis. And sa he angryit þaim weill fast Till þame behuffit at þe last To leif sum of þaim in ostage, The laif to pass hame in þat rage, And till him with þame agane bring Beniamyne his broþer ?ing; Than leiffit with him Symeon And hame þai past sone onone, And tald þare fader how þai ware Anoyit in till Egipt saire; And Beniamyne ?it at þe last With þame on till Egipt past Mekill agane his fader will, That had presumptioun of þaim ill. ?it were þai set in hardare press Fra Beniamyne þare cummyn wess; Bot at þe last Ioseph þaim tald He wes þare broþer þat þai sald, And for þare heill in to þat land God him sauffit sa liffand. Than for his fader he gert þaim pass; Thai tald him Ioseph liffand was, And with þat word he woxe sa fayne That his spreit qwiknyt agane, And buskit him deliuerly In Egipt for to pass in hy To se his sone at for him send, And þare his lif with him take end; And þus, as ?e haif herd me tell, In Egipt thus come first Israell. In this tyme Prothomeus ?ing Of Calcasus wes lord and king, In to þe kinrik of Asye, And kennyt þaim first philosophy. He wes the broþer of Archland, That king wes of all Affrik land. Thai fen?e þat tyme he maid men, For diuerss craftis he couth ken; Figuris of men he maid alsua, The quhilkis be sorcery he gert ga. Ryngis first he gert men weire, That he on myd fyngere gert beire, For fra þat to þe hert, he said, Ane ewyne strekand vayne laid; And alsua for maist bellising Thare on he gert þaim weire þe ring. Trycolomus þat tyme alsua Be navyne past in Grece þarfra; Thare he kennyt þaim with mare cure Than þai were wont to mak culture. That tyme alsua Dame Creces, That of corne wes callit goddes, First gert corne with mesour met, As boll or furlot, busche or pek, Quhare forouth þat bot nocht a strake Or heipit vp þai wald it tak; Tharfor scho wes callit Demana Oure all þe land of Grecia. CHAPTER XXIV. Of Dewcalyonis flude, And of þaim als þat till him ?ude. A thousand and v? ?ere Thre skore and twa to rekin cleire Befor þe Incarnatioun, In Athenis Amphitrioun, The fader þan of Hercules, That þe gyant quhilum wes, Fra Cirope þat wes þe thrid king That had Athenis in gouernyng. Than all þe folkis of Thessaly Had neire bene drovnyt sodanely With a fell ferss falland flude; Thai were a few till hill þai ?ude; Apone a hill wes callit Parnas Thare þai ware þat sauffit was. All þe land þat were about Dewcalioun þaim aucht but dout, That ressauit wiþ gud will All þai þat fled and slaid him till; The men þat þe flude had vndone Wes thro him haill reformyt sone. And þis Diucalioun in þai dais With his wif Perra, Ovide sais, Ay vp fra hill to hill þai past, And one þe hieast at þe last Thai oure baid with felloune flude, And to þe planys syne þai ?ude. Thare þare freyndis and þare kyne Thai myssit sone, baith maire and myne, Na þai couth fynd na liffand man In all þai landis sterand þan, Thai were vndone sa halely And drownyt in þat dyluy. Than till a coif Dewcalioun And his wif Perra past doune, And deuotly þai maid þare Till a goddess þare prayare, To wyttyre þaim for hir pete How mankynd mycht reformyt be; And þus till þai were prayand fast, A voce þaim ansuerd at þe last, Out of þat coife at þai sald ga, And þare moder banys ta, And behynd þaim þame cast; And þan out of þe coif þai past, And mossit apone gret manere Quhat suld betakin þis ansuere. For sa þe spait had all ouregane That þai fand nouþer flesche nor bane Off þare moder, and forthy Thai ferlyit of this thing gretly. Thus quhillis þai mossit þis, Perra Begouth speking for to ca; For redely wylis in wemen Sonnere apperis þan in men. Scho said: “I can be na way trow That vthire moder haif we now Than þe erd, and þe stanis Ar oure moder and oure banis. Tharfor I reid at we ga fast And lat behind ws stanis cast.” With þis Dewcalio? did alhaill, And Perra gaif him for counsaill, And of þai castis efter grew Men and wemen all of new. Sa of þare kyne þai stuffit þe land Quhare befor þai wer duelland; And efter gret mortaliteis ?it men þus growis in seire cuntreis. In to þe kinrik ?it of France Is nane sa redy craft nor chance Off men and wemen now to fynd As to cast stanis fast behind. Forthy to þe conclusioun Off þis goddis ressioun Ovide maid þire ilk verss In memor þat I sall reherss: In geminis durum sumus expertique malorum Et documenta damus qua sumus orygine nati. “Here of, he sais, be kynd we ta For to be doure and hard alsua, And we mak kend rycht properly Quhareof our kynd suld cummyn be.” All this þat I rehersit now Standis ws nocht in neid to trow, For þare is nane at þis can reid Amangis þe artiklis of þe Creid. CHAPTER XXV. Heire it tellis of þe teyne wrakis Off Egipt and full mentioun makis. A thousand and fif hundreth ?ere And sevin and xl. haill, but weire, Or God wes of þe Virgin borne, That sauffit mankynd þat wes forlorne, The wraikkis tenne in Egipt raiss; For Israell þat anoyit was In seruitude and foull thrillage, Throuch king Pharo and his barnage, That in till Egipt raiss of new And of Ioseph na thing knew. Thai thocht ill þat sic multitud Off alienis þat about þaim stude, Quhen Iacob, as ?e herd me tell, That callit wes alsa Israell, His sone Ioseph for to se Past in Egipt with his men?e And brocht in with him, tald and seyne, Thre score of ladyis and fiftene, With him þat in till Egipt past. Thare syne þai grew vp sa fast Off ymagyne and engyne, Off berth and of vertu syne, Off welth at will wiþ sufficians, And of riches in haboundans, That þe Egiptis for invy Anoyit þaim dispitously, And in all werkis þaim pynouris maid, Quhen þai were growin to manhaid. The king gert command but remeid The knaif child suld be put to dede Off all þe Israelitis ilkane, That borne were þare suld be sauf nane; Bot all þe madyne barnis he That were to beire suld sauffit be. And thus þat king þat wes sawage Held þis folkis in hard thirlage, Na wald nocht thole þaim on na wiss Thame for to mak þare sacrifiss To God of mycht in wildernes, As he wes chargeit be Moyses, Quhill first þare watter is turnyt in blude, Paddois syne þare landis oure ?ude, Syne were þai bittyne with synyfeis, That a kynd of cleggis is, That gert þaim ?uke baith heid and hals. Syne in þar bledderis bolnyt bylis And alkyne bruke as scab þat wyle is; Syne commone qwalme as of þar fee, As scheip or nolt or gait suld be, And at þe last in generall All þar airis deid doune haill Be sa ferss mortalite That nane in all þat land wes fre. Than his eldest sone wes deid For ony manere of remeid Till of þat land þai leit þaim pass. Moyses þan þare ledare was, And gaif þame lawis to lif by Writtin in to þe mont of Synay. In Egipt als, quha couth it ken, Thare wes ma wraikis all out na ten, As tellis þe buke of Exodie, Quhasa lukis it perfitlye; Bot þat þai were all sa fell, In ten of þame were maist cruell, Wthire were for?et for autouris seire That makis mentioun of þat matere; Bot efter þan, as sum men sais, Were notit þe forbodin dais In ilk moneth of þe ?ere, Begynnand first in Ianuere. Bot Egiptis nocht forthy Sa wyss were in astronomy That wes nocht to trow þai tald All thire dais forbodin to hald. Than men suld in þame begyne And at þai saw proffit in, As to begyn or tak wyage, Ony gud werk or pilgremage; Bot of þe elymentis seire Thai þat haiffis þar matere, Or feillis þar complexioun Muffit to constillatioun Discordand, it were nocht bot skill That þare dais were kepit till The Egiptis in till perplexite, For dout þar land suld perist be And with þai wrakis all vndone. Sum of þame tuke purposs of sone Out of þat land for to pass; And Denyss Bachus ane þan was, At for þat dout all Egipt left, And duelling maid in Grece þareft. Thare kend he þaim of þat cuntre Off wyne wynnyng þe subtilte, Quhare in þe cunnand wes at all; Tharfor þar god of wyne him call. That tyme alsua Trikokis king Off Egipt dred þe vndoying, And in to Grece efter him can pass, And duelling maid in Athenas. CHAPTER XXVI. Heire it tellis quhan of Brutus Come and devidit Brettane þus. Out of Sythye within þat quhile In to Grece come Sir Newill, That wes of deid a douchty man, And in to Grece gret lordschip wan, As wes neire þe xx. degre Be lyne discendand of Noe, Off his ?oungest sone, but let, That to name wes hattyne Iaphet. Off Sem his broþer come preistheid, And of þis Iaphet come knychtheid. This wes fra þis Noe As I said [nere] þe xx. degre. He had a sone callit Gedell-Glaiss, As þe story of him sayis, That weddit to wif Scota ?ing, Pharois dochter of Egipt king. This Gadeill-Glaiss wes of gret pith, And warnyst weill of wit þarwith; He gat on Scota barnis faire, And ane of þai suld haif bene aire To king Pharo þat drovnit was In þe Reid Se quhen he couth chass Apone þe folkis of Israell, As ?e forouth this herd tell; Quhare all þe Israellis passit dry, The Egiptis drovnit halely. This Gadeill-Glaiss quhen he saw The land of Egipt hie and law, That in all thing wes proffitable, And till his liffing delectable, His wynnyng þare he thocht to ma, And his advantage of it ta, Sene his barnys apperit to be Lordis of all þat ryaltie. Bot þat barnage þan of þat land That remanit þan liffand Thocht how þai wer agrevit sair And thocht on þe wraikis þai tholit air; Be þat ensample throu counsall All alienis þai banyst haill. Quhare þis ilk Gadeill-Glaiss Out of þat cuntre tuke his waiss, And throu þe Meir Mediterane He passit quhill he come in Spane, And one þe watter of Hebery He biggit þe toune of Brigansy, Quhare now þe tovne is of Galise; Thare sanct Iames þe appostill lyise, And þai þat duellis þan in þat land He gert till him be obeyand. Syne as he past on a day Throu þe cuntre in his play, Oure fra him beyond a see He saw lyand a gret cuntre. Than sperit he thraly of þat land Quhat þai wer therin wonnand; Bot þarof ansuere gat he nane, Nor nakyne knawlege in certane. In hy þan gert he schippis thre With armyt men sone stuffit be, And gert þaim pass be se ther way To se þat land how þat it lay, And gif þat it wes eith to wyne, And quha wes wonnand it within. With wynd at will þe folk furth past, And in þat land come at þe last, That wes ane ile in to þe se Off gret space and of quantite; Bot þai þat duelt þan in þat ile Vnhonest folkis wer and rycht vile; Tharfor þai þat come for to spy That land, þai dressit vnmoderly; For sum of þame þai slew rycht þare, And sum þai dang with airis saire, And þai þat happinnit to get away Held to þare schippis but delay, And saillit all þat ile about, And saw þai mycht with litill dout Wyne it halely to þare will, Gif þai wald do þare mycht þaretill. Thai saillit out þar way in hy With wynd at will to Brigrinsy; Thare Gadeill-Glaise wes ourtane With deid throu a chance on ane; Bot his body with honour Wes had till honest sepultour, With sic vse and solempnyte As was þat tyme in þat cuntre. Thai spyis tald his sonnys sone How þai in to þat ile had done; Thai said at it wes eith to wyne, For þai þat duelt þat ile within Wer bot vile, of na valew, Nor of na gouernance na of vertew; And at þat land wes proffitable And till all liffing delitable. Forthi þai said it wes þar will, And full counsall þai gaif þartill, For to pass þat ile within, And it be conquest to þaim wyne, And with þare avne it occupy To þame and þairis heretably. [Ane] sone of Gadeill-Glaiss þan, Yber, þat wes a douchty man, Thocht it wes till him liffing fair, Sen he wes nocht his fader He sone inclynit to þare counsall, And chesit him men and wittaill, And put his schippis to þe se, And enterit in with his men?e, And tuke vp saill and furþ on past And in þat ile come at þe last; And all þe folkis he slew haill doune That were nocht till his bidding bovne, And of þe lafe he tuke homage. Thus all þat land in heretage He wan with forse and maid it fre Till him and his posterite. Sa occupiit he furth þat land With þe gud he þarin fand, And Scotland gert he call þat ile For honour of his moder quhile, That Scota wes with all men callit, As ?e herd forow þis be tald. Ybernia þat callit is syne Off þis Yber in Latyne, That we oise now Irland to call In oure langage Inglis all. Off Yber þai come halely That we call Irischery; And þis lady callit Scota All þir Scottis ar cummyn fra, And as ?e may in þe process heir Quhen we ar cummyn to þat mater. CHAPTER XXVII. How þe Scottis out of Irland Come first and inhabit Scotland. Bot be þe Brute ?it Barbour sayis Off Irischery all oþir wayis; That Gurgut-Badruge quhile wes king, And Brettane had in gouernyng. Worthy, wyse and wicht wes he, And passyt anys oure þe se Fra Denmark at he wynnyng had; By Orknay hame he tuke his trad, And of schippis he fand twenty With Spaynhellis all in cumpany That flemyt ar of þare cuntre, And lang wer waverand in þe se. Bertholome, þat þare ledare was, Besocht þis king Gurgut of grace To tak þaim till him of duelling, And gif þaim land to þar wynnyng, And send with þaim of his men Till Irland, þat wes nocht ?it then Inhabit, bot waist wes halely. Off þis folkis come þe Yrischery, That wynnis in Irland to þis day, And Irische Yrland callit ar þai. ?it is þare oþir autouris seire That tretis mare of þis mater; Bot þai vse nocht to tell his name, His stait, his gre, nor ?it his fame, Off quham þe Irischeryis cummyn ar; Bot tellis quhen þe Egiptis war Drownit in till þe Reid Se The laif, þat laiffit in þat cuntre, Banyst fra þaim a gentilman That wes amang þaim wonnand þan, And siclik wes he of natioun, And wes of gret discretioun. Thai doutit þat his sen?eory Suld þame habandoun halely, Be þe ensample at þai wer Befor throu alienis angerit sair. This gentilman and his men?e Gat schippis sone and tuke þe se, And salit Affrik all about, Dreiffing felly with stormys stout, And by mony costis seir That spedis nocht to rekyne heir. Syne in to þe Span?e se Him happinnit to cum with his men?e, Quhare he tuke land, and mony ?ere He and his þare wonnand were; Sa he and all his progeny Held þat land ay heretably. Out of Span?e þan in Irland Thai come and wan alhaill þat land, Quhen passit wes xii. ?ere Fra þe Egiptis drownit were, Chasand þe folkis of Israell, As ?e haue herd forow þis tell. Quha þat will cast dait to dait, As autouris in þare storyis wrait, And will rekin ?ere by ?ere, The some salbe iii? ?ere And xlii. ?eris beforne Or Ihesu wes of Mary borne. I will nocht þir opinionis all Contrare, for þai may weill fall; Bot it is doutwise be þe dait That cronyclaris befor me wrait, And vþir incedentis seire According part to þis mater. Bot quheþer it be, or vþir wayis Than all þir autouris befor me sayis, For certane ?e sall vnderstand That out of Span?e in till Irland The Scottis come, þat to þis day Has it and Scotland haldin ay. In þe thrid eild, withoutin less, In Span?e þe Scottis cummyn wes; Within þe ferd eild als Irland Wes to þe Scottis obeyand. Syne sum of þaim can occupy Part of þe north of Brettany. Than wes in it thre nationis, Scottis, Pightis and Brettones. Part of þe Scottis remanit in Span?e, Quhen þai come first to Brettan?e, And Scottis þai speke halely, And ?it ar callit Mawatry. Naverne now call we þat cuntre; Mychty it is of corne and fee. CHAPTER XXVIII. How þe kingis stane out of Irland Wes brocht first fra þin in Scotland. In þe first buke gif þat ?e Will neir þe last end reid and se, Thare may ?e fynd þe genologyis That in till all part signyfyis As our king suld cummyn be Discendand evin fra Noe; And quhy at þai disseuir þare ?e sall wit or ?e pass forthirmare. In þe thrid eild storyis seir Sayis þe Scottis cummyng wer With Gadeill-Glaiss in Span?e land, And in þe ferd eild in Irland, And in þe [fift] eild, lang beforne, In Scotland, or þat God wes borne. Thir genologyis I maid forthy Devysit, as ?e se, distynctly, And suppose I fand be name Thame all writting, ?it of þe fame Of mony and þe douchtynes, That lang tyme sa forletit wes, Mater nane I worthy fand That to your hering wer plesand In to þis tretise for to writt. Sa suld I dull haill ?our delite, And ?e suld call it bot rayne Or þat I had þaim all ourtane, Gif I suld tell þaim halely As þai ar in þe genology, Without oþir distinctioun. Forthy wes myne ententioun Amangis þe eildis þaim to draw, Devisit sa þat ?e mycht knaw Quha þat wer originall, And þe begynnyng principall Off ilk cuntre quhare þat þai Occupiit þare efter ay; And sa suld I excusit be Gif I mak nocht þare entre Quhare þare entre first began In to þai landis at þai wan, Till oþer staittis accordand In Rome [or] Israell þan regnand Befor þe Incarnatioun. For I first na discriptioun, Than I fynd ay sum discrepans, That I am nocht of sufficians For to ger þame all accord; Bot sympilly for to record Within þe eildis þat þai fell, And nane oþir termis to tell. And quhare I left now to begin I haif in purpose, ore I blyne, [As in] þe first buke, of Woden, That fader wes of mony men. His sone wes hattyne Bydagyus, That fader wes to Brondeus; And þis Brondeus efter þat Wes Fredgaris fader, and him gat. He had a sone wes callit Frewyne, That Bygeus gat efter syne; His sone Gemmos gat Elfeus, That fader wes of Heleseus. Heleseus gat Kardycy, That aucht West Saxone halely; The first king þarof wes he That it first aucht in ryalte. He gat Kynycius efter syne, That fader wes of Fealfyne; His sone Guncum gat Thadee, Caldcallis fader syne wes he, And his sone Comaid efter þat Ynys broþer, Ingalis gat. Now of þir or I tell ma, Till Gadeill-Glais will I ga. This Gadeill-Glais efter þat To sone Yber-Syowut gat; Yber syne, as I herd tell, Fader wes of Nauaell; This Nauaell gate Node, And Alwyne efter þat gat he. Off him come efter Erbraida, That gat Daad and Hegbraida. His sone Brogen gat Broge, That gat þar efter Weande; And his sone Myla gat Mylet of Spane, and efter þat Ermone callit Malanseid; [Off] his Iaer-Olfaca Come Coryne, and efter þai Off þis Coryne come Phalek, That fader wes to Tykyrnek; And his [sone] efter Enbaca Had a sone callit Senreta. Fyabrig-Labryne efter þat Ewyne-Olyngrug to sone gat. His sone Chamaell gat Eden, And Serf-Olbacry gat Kawen. His sone hecht Negodad-Faell, That gat Glais as I herd tell. Off his sone Edome efter þat Come Coryne-Duf þat to sone gat Symone-Breke, þat of Span?e land That stane brocht first in to Irland, That syne wes callit mony ?ere The kingis stule in Scotland here, As ?e sall wit herefter sone Quhen þis process till it is done. CHAPTER XXIX. How first þe kinrik raise of Perse This clause will clerely ?ow reherse. A thowsand and v? ?ere And twa and fourty full, but weir, Befor þe blest Natiuite That wes þe mater of our gle, In till Egipt Schir Danaus, That broþer wes till Egestus, Off douchteris nomerit had fifty. Egist had sonis sa mony; Thai sonnys slane wer euerilk ane With þai dochteris to sauf ane, That gat away full prevely. Egestus þarfor fellonly Gert his broþer banyst be Off Egipt; in Argos enterit he, Quhare Menelayus than wes king, That maid him curtase welcummyng, And resauit him in þat neid, And did him proffet and fordeid. And he did velany þare agane; For he þis Menelayus wald haif slane; Be þe lest him banyst he, And þe men haill of þat cuntre He abandonyt all him till, And maid þaim bosum till his will; And sa he regnyt in his steid, That banyst wes for dout of deid. That tyme Buseris in Egipt als A fellone ostlare wes and fals; And his deuocioun wes weill war, And his consciens cruellar Than ony wichecraft þat mycht be, Or tyrandry in ony gre. For till gestis on blith manere He wald þaim welcum and mak gud chere, Than to þaim wald he ta gud keip, Till þai wer sadly all on sleip; Than stilly wald he to þaim ga, And schere þare throt boll in twa; Thare blud syne wald he sacrify Till his goddis deuotly, Thinkand þai suld be personer Off meid or pane þat he suld beir; For he said at all sacrifise Plesit his goddis on all wise. Tereus in his tyme alsua Lay by his awne sisteris twa, Pruignas callit and Philomene; For þat foull lust fell murther kene; For quhen þe tane full wittering had And at scho had lossit hir madinhad, Hir awne sone scho slew but dout, Hir sister toung syne schore scho out; Hir sone scho seythit in pecis small, And gert his fader ete him all. Perseus in þat tyme alsua Come out of Grece in Asya, Quhare all þat tyme þe folkis wer Off roid condicioun and manere; Bot he þame wan with his travale, And force of fecht in to batall, And gert þame till him bowsum be; Syne Perse he gert call þat cuntre, And on þis wise as I reherse That kinrik first begouth of Perse. The fen?eit fabillis I will forbeir That Ovide tellis ?ow how Iupiter Gert egill als, as we reid, Revise þe barne Ganymeid, And beir him vp in till þe aire Quhare Iupiter maid repaire. Tharefor þis souerane of beautee Lemman to þat god wes he, And spensare als quhen Eles Remuffit to þat office wes. How Tantalus, þat wes a feir To goddess in allya neir, This Ganymeid on þis wise reft, Tuke and held him langer eft Till lust of þis Iupiter, Or till his awne lust at wes neir; How Pelops, þe sone of Tantalus, Raise agane Schir Dardanus, That lord of Troy wes in þai dais; How Perseus, [as] þe fabill sais, With Thebannys and Parthaneys Maid mony sindry iuperdyis, And how Edippus, as sais Stace, That slaar of his fader was, Gat one his moder sonnys twa, And wes his barnys brother swa; And how þe barne Ethiocles Faught with his brother Peliaces, In þat entent at baith wer sene Fechtaris and manslaaris kene, And oþir fen?eit fabillis seir At I will leif to writt in heir, For and I did as oþir wrait In þis pass I suld set þar dait. CHAPTER XXX. Off Duke Iosue and of his dedis Heir may ?e fynd quha at it redis. In þis ilk tyme þat I of tell Wes Iosue duke of Israell. The watter of Iordane in his dais Wes all dry, as þe story sais, Till at his folkis ourepassit fre Off Ierico þe gret cete; And all þat euer he fand þarin, Man and best, baith mare and myn, He vndid and slew all doune, And brocht it to confusioun; Bot gold and siluer and weschall, Clenely maid of fyne metall, He gert halow with honour To Goddis vse and his tresour. That tyme als in þat cete He gert þe wedow savit be, That sawit his spyis wysely Quhen þai come þe toune to spy. Thare Achor als þe mantill stall, The siluer and þe reull withall, And ran in sentens of cursing For at he stall and brak bidding; Tharfor Iosue but remeid Gert him be stanyt þare to deid. Syne past he furth for till assay Gif he mycht wyne þe tovne of Hay; He wan with iuperdy þat toune And of it slew xii. thousand doune. Fra þin with his oste onone He past for to wyne Gabaone, That throu desait þe Gabonytis Wer freyndit with Israelitis; For quhen þai herd at Iosue Wes to cum with his ryalte, Thai doutit saire at he wald wyne There landis and þare ceteis bryne, As he to Ierico had done, And fra Hay þarefter sone Messingeris to Iosue Thai gert of counsall ordanit be, With auld hoise and revin schone, And mowllit breid in baggis done; Be þai takinnis to be kend That þai wer of fre landis send. One þis wise þe Gabonytis Come chargeit to þe Israelitis, And deliuerit in þare presens To Iosue plane credens, And said þai come of landis seir Quhare þat þai herd of his power, And þai landis þat þai had To Iowis wes in premissioun maid; Bot of þere will to Iosue In seruice þai wald bundin be, And þis, þai said, wes þare entent That þai in message hidder sent. To þare wordis Iosue Trowit, and þaim resauit he, And of his oste þe lordis þare Be aith to þaim all bundin ware. Bot within thre dais efter þat Quhen Iosue full wittering gat That he dissauit wes but weire, He argouyt þaim on fell manere; And þai excusit þame sympilly And said þai did it for þis quhy; For it wes gert þaim vnderstand That þai wald occupy þare land, And hald it in possessioun, And bring þame to confusioun; Sen þai wer sa bundin þaim till Thai mycht do with þaim all þar will. The multitud þan wes richt laith For to save þaim for þare aith; For þai said it wes surreptioun, Off fraude and circumuentioun Suorne befor þat, and forthy Thai wer excusit lauchfully All þai chullouris for to ca, And but mercy to pyne or sla. Bot þe lordis wald nocht vndo The bandis þat þai wer oblist to, Bot said at þai thocht wonder laith For to be argwit of þare aith; For baith to freynd and fa suld be Faith evinlik kepit in lawte. And þus þai ?ude all to counsall, And alsone þai deliuerit haill To take þar gudis and þar tovne Haill in þare possessioun, And mak þai men þar lauboraris, Masons, wrychtis and pynowraris, And sa mycht ?it revengeit be, Excusand baith faith and lawte. Thus maid þai schort deliuerance, And gert fulfill þis ordinance. Than of þis thing herd kingis five, That merchit neir þam, and belive Thai come with þar ost and onone For till assege Gabaone, And þai within on set counsall Askit at Iosue suppowell, And he with his oste come onone And chasit þai folkis throu Betherone; For of him þai had sic dreid That þai to fle fast can þaim speid. Hailstanys gret in to þat flycht Sa hevy gret and sad can licht, That þare perischit ma in to that schour Than suerdis stekit in þat stour, And till þai wer in to þe chace The sone rycht fast availland was. Than Iosue with deuocioun Deuotly maid his vrysoune To God, and sa þan gert he stand Baith sone and mone, still vnmovand, As wer þe space all of a day That neuer syne, as I herd say, Sa lang a day wes sene beforne With all þai þat tyme wes borne. In þat tyme his fais quyt Iosue halyly discomfit. Ay þis tyme in to þat chas, Quhillis Iosue þus prekand was, His men persauit quhare kingis five Crap in a coif to sauf þare live. Off þat coif þe mouth gert he With gret stanys fast stopit be, Quhill þat all þe chas wes done; And syne he gert foroutin hone Out of þat coif þai kingis bring And þai apoun a gallo hing. Of Iosue and of victoryise, And other sindry iuperdyise That wer in till his dais done In till þe Bibill ?e may sone Fynd þaim writtin in his buke, Gif ?e will all his story luke. CHAPTER XXXI. Heir may ?e reid in þis ilk pece Off a weir þat befell in Grece. Fourtene hundreth ?eris beforne And xii. fully or God wes borne, A fell weir raise, as Orose sais, And a dispitious in þai dais Betuix þaim wonnand in þe Cretee, That is ane yle in to þe see, And þe folkis of Athenys, That in to Grece a gret toune is. Thare slauchter happinnit rycht cruell, One baith þe halffis ferss and fell; Bot þe Grekis soucht sa fast Quhill þe Grekis at þe last Maist part in þat batall qwite Wer tane, or slane, or discomfit. The gentill menis sonis þare, That airis to þare faderis ware, Thai tuke in þat weir, but dout, And all þir syne þai put quyt out. A Mynataur, a quhether þat he A felloun man or best suld be, I can nocht tell ?ow certanely, Sen all þai childer halely Thai gert deliuerit be him till For to be suellyit at his will, And with þe best wer etyne þare. The Greikis þus reboitit ware. The Lauypittis and þe Thessalytis, In Grece baith þai landis lyis, In þat tyme vsit gret travale Amangis þaim self in gret batall. In till a buke þat Palaphat Of his vncertane wondris wrait, He sais þe Lauypitis trowis haill And tellis als for certane taill That Thessalonyis suld be Ypocentauris in a degre, That is for to say properly Baith man and horss in a body; And supposs þai sik wenyng had That ?it sic best wes neuer maid; Bot for at þai saw sa thik Thir men on horss in batall prik, Vther trouth haif þai nane, Bot horss and men samyn wer ane. CHAPTER XXXII. Heir may ?e fynd of Dedalus And of his dedis mervalus. Ovide tellis als mystely In till his Methomorphosy, That is a buke callit of changeing, In till our proper vndoying; For in till it ar changeingis seir, That ferlyfull ar for till heir; This Ovide sais at Dedalus Wes in his dedis mervalus; Off Athenis he wes king, And mekle had in gouernyng. First to lordschip quhen he drew His nevo in his yre he slew, And exilit for þat causs wes he Out of Athenis in Crete, The quhilk is in þe se ane ile, Thare Moneus regnyt in þat quhile, As king wes þat tyme of Crete, And had a wif hecht Phasisee, Baith of fassoune and of face Formyt faire at all scho was. As þis quene apoun a day Hir laykand in a medow lay, A taur, þat is a bull, we wene, Scho saw befor hir on þat grene, Gnyppand gerse rycht gredely. As scho beheld him increly, Hir fleschly lust maid hir sa kene That vnder him scho wald haif bene. Scho pressit to plese him with all slycht, Ay brandysand in till his sicht, And maid hir ofte with him to bowrd; Bot þat best, þat of kynd wes gowrd, Wist na thing quhat scho couth meyne, Bot wenyt hir bourd had manans bene; Sa ay as scho wald draw him neir, Fra place to place þe bull wald steir. Scho luffit þat best sa straitly That scho wald fayne haue had copy Off him, gif scho ony wiss mocht Be kynd þat to þat accordit nocht. And till þat scho wes travalit þus, Scho come of caiss till Dedalus, And schew till him hir malady, And syne requyrit him specially That he wald se for hir remeid, Or þan but dout scho wald be deid. One þis request scho wes sa thra That scho wald na wyss pass him fra, Till þat he gaif þarto assent Hir till allegis of hir torment. Than he hir formyt in a kow, Bot þat is nocht all for to trow, And þe bull, quhen he saw þat, A Mynotaur apoun hir gat, And quhen hir tyme wes worne all out, Of þis bysyne best, but dout, Scho wes deliuerit; and quhen þis King of Crete, Meneyis, It saw, in hert he wes full wa, For þat he wes eschamyt sa; Than a steid he maid in hy A closoure wonder subtely, And closit it straitly all about, That quha within wald press þaim out Suld of fyne forss mak entre, And quha without within wald be To be þarout ay him behuffit, Quhat kyne craft sa euir he pruffit. The Laborynt þai call þat place; The Mynotaur in to it set was, And syne þai vsit generaly To call it Domus Dedaly. Dedalus quhen he saw þis, He was sa ferd for Myneyis That of þat land he wald haif bene, Gif he couth ony way vnsene; Bot him behuffit our a se, And schippin nane to þat had he. Than þis ilk Dedalus And his sone Ycarus Maid þame fethranys for to fle, And till his sone he bad þat he Suld, quhen he schupe him to þe flycht, Hald evin on in till a randome rycht, Nouþer till hie, for dout of air Suld melt away his fetheris fair, Nor ?it our law, for dout of flude Suld wesche away his fedderis gude. Bot þis Ycarus in his flycht Maid a courss sa hie on hycht That him in neid behuffit cum doune; Sa hapnit he in þe se to drovne. Be þis ensample þe ilk werss Wer maid þat I sall heir rehers: Eucarii fati memores, estote parati Iussa paterna pati; medium tenuere beati. Off þe werd of Ycarii Beis ay thochtfull, and reddy To thole ?our fader bidding ay; Haly men mesour held alway. The bull þat þis dame Phasyse Luffit sa weill in properte, (Gif ?e of þat thing mare will wit, To Ovidis buke I ?ow remytt,) Hir awne stewart at by hir lay One hir gat in chalmer play A barne þat wes full prevely Borne and nerist syne tenderly. Gret slycht, as ?e herd, scho lerit, Tharewith hir lordis E scho blerit. [CHAPTER XXXIII.] Twelf hundreth and xxx. ?eris beforne And twa ?eris to or God wes borne, Wersores, þan of Egipt king, Baith south and north maid gret stering, And set his diligens ay Baith þai artis as þai lay, Be land partit and be se, To gar þaim bow to his powste, Or he wald þame first assaill With felloune weir and hard batall. Thare one message he send in hy To þame þan wonnand in Sythy, And bad at þai suld till him draw, And vse his custom and his law, And becum in deid his men. To þis message þai ansuerd þen, And said þame thocht it wranguise thing Till him at wes a mychty king Agane sa symple folkis to ryse, Or faynd in weir þaim to supprise; Sen vre of batall is doutwise And till all partyis peralouse. Off þis thing to mak schort our taill, Thai mellit sone in to batall, Quhare þare wes fechting ferss and fell, In baith þe halffis and cruell; Bot þis Wersores at þe last Discomfit wes and fled full fast. The Sythikis vencust þat batall, And tuke up all þare apparall That þai leiffit in to þe place Quhare þe batall strekin was; Thai chasit þe Egiptis halely, One horss and fut dispitously, And þai, for ferdnes fleand fast, Gat fra þare danger at þe last. The Sythikis þan with þare poware Waistit all þat land with weir, Na wer þe Egiptis dikis deip About þame dowin þare land to keip. Sythikis þan with plane batall Maid throu Asye þare travaill, And wan mekle of it of weir, That þai maid to þaim tributere. Xv. ?eris þai þare abaid, And langer wonnyng wald haif maid, Quhill þare wiffis maid þaim kend Be þe message þat þai send, Bot gif þai speid þaim hame but let That other suld þare barnis get. CHAPTER XXXIV. How twa ladyis tuke gouernall Off kinrikis and faucht in batall. In þe meynetyme þat þis wes, Twa ?oung men in to Sythy raiss; The tane wes hattyn Plunyus, The toþer Scolopiteus, That be lawis of þat land Mycht nocht for oþer deidis stand. The lordis set þaim to ta, And for þare trespass þaim to sla, Sa þat of neid þaim behuffit To be banyst and remuffit Fra þare kyne and all þare kyth. Off ?oung fallowis þai gat þaim with A licht hedit cumpany, And set þaim haill on fellony, And maid in straittis þare ressett With all þe stuf at þai mycht get, And sum landis neir þaim by Thai gert obey to þare mastry, And diuerss landis þai distroyit, Thareof þe folkis wer sair anoyit; Sa þai conspirit prevely With landis at lay neir þaim by, The quhilkis þat maid þaim sic a trayne That mony of þaim haif þai slane; And all þe laif þare deid sa dred That þai to strater hichtis fled, And sa wes scaillit all þat rout That of þe laif wes had na dout. The wiffis of þaim þat þus wer deid, That wedois wer and will of reid, Muffit ware in till sic ire, That þai for felony brynt as fyre; Amangis þaim self þare mayne þai maid, Menand þe scaith þat þai tane had, Gaderit þame to gidder haill, And maid amangis þaim to counsaill, And tuke to purpose for to quyt The felloune slauchter and dispite Done to þare husbandis at wer slane, Set þai dee suld in to þe payne. One þis þai set all þare entent, Bot þai kest ane impediment, Doutwiss to fall in to þat chass, Sen faynt be kynd all wemen wes, And wounder argh for to se blud, Quharein as þan þare purpose stude There hertis in þe deid suld fall, And syne þai tyne sall þar trawall, And for þare foly presumptioun To be put to confusioun. To þis ilkane said þare assent, And decernyt in þare entent; Bot of þat poynt of þare accord I dare nocht playnely mak record, For dreid þat women wald me blame Gif þat I tuichit þar diffame, And call it myne auctorite, Set it autentik story be; And als þe sampill is rycht fell The properte þarof to tell. Bot Orose in till his first buke, Quha sa likis it to luke, In þe xxiiii. chapter, Can tell ?ow þarof þe maner, Quhat sa it wes at þai began, And held apone it stoutly þan, And raissit weir and plane batall, And stoutly maid þaim till assaill Thai landis lyand þame about, And maid þaim to þame vnderlout, And slew þare innemeis ilkane That þare husbandis befor had slane; And þus of weir þai wan þat land, And mad it to þame obeyand. Bot sum men þai gert savit be, In tyme to cule þar qualite, And in ane ile þai gert þaim ga, Amangis þaim na repar to ma; And quhat tyme þat þare appetit Thame muffit in lust and delite, That ile ay þai wald pass till Thare fleschly lust for to fulfill; And quhat barnis wes gottin þare, Quhen þare moderis deliuer ware Off knaif child þai wald sla mony; The madinnis þai nurist tendirly, Bot away þai wald ger bryn The rycht pap þe flesche within, Leiffand nocht of it a crote, For dout it suld lat þaim of schot.

The tane wes hattyn Massepia, The toþer Lampit wes cald; Baith in batall þai wer bald. Off Europe landis rycht mony Thai wan, and mekle of Asye; Thai biggit a cete hecht Symyrna, Ephesone þai maid alsa; Welthe at will þai wan of weir, All Asye doutit þare power. This Lampit with hir cumpany Past hame agane in to Sythy, And left behind hir dame Massepia, With hir court þat land to keip sa That Asyanis raiss hir agane, And has hir in till batall slane. Hir dochter Synope efter hir deid Raiss and raxit in hir steid. Sik name raiss of þat ryall rout That landis seir of þaim had dout, And out of Grece be counsall wes To werray þaim send Hercules, That chesit with him þe wichtest men In till all Grece at he couþ ken, And mony schippis gret gert he With men and armour stuffit be, For paralouss þat weir him thocht Or to full purposs it wer brocht. With all þis ?it in plane batall Opinly durst he þaim not assaill, Bot in þe nycht all prevely He slew of þaim a gret party As he come on vnpurvaid, Vnwarnyst wer þai and vnarrayit. Twa sisteris had þe gouernall That tyme of þe land alhaill, Antiope and Orichia; Thir wer þe names of þai twa, ?it other sisteris twa had þai, Nocht of sic stait, þe suth to say; Menelympe callit wes þe tane, Scho with Hercules wes tane, And he deliuerit hir all fre Till hir sister Antiopte, And for hir ransoune tuke na mare Bot þe armes þat scho bare. The toþer sister Ypolies Weddit with Thesyus wes; Nixt Hercules in all degre The graitest of þe oste wes he. Thare sister Orichia wes deid, Pentessale raiss þan in hir steid, Hir dochter and hir air of all That till hir of proffit suld fall. This lady pruffit gret douchtynes Quhen þe Grekis assegiand wes The tovne of Troy with þe power; Thidder with hir oste scho come of weir, As in þe story þarof is kend. Bot schortly now for to mak end, A hundreth ?ere þare power stud, Landis seir þare mychtis oure ?ude, Waistand haill with þare power, And bigand as þare willis wer. CHAPTER XXXV. Off Troyis fell distructioun And of Bructis cummyn in þis regioun. A thousand a hundreth and foure score And twa ?eris fully gane our Befor Cristis incarnatioun, Off Troy wes þe distructioun, That þe Grekis neir xii. ?eris Assegiand wes with þare poweris. How þat began and endit was Omer tretis and Dares; And efter Troyis distructioun And þe cete casting doune, Eneas gert xii. schippis be Wittalit and laid to þe se. He and his fader Anchises, Ascaneus als, at his sone wes, In þai xii. schippis tuke þe see, With all þar gudis and þar men?e, And saillit, hapnit in ane yle That be name wes callit Cecile. Thare þat tyme dede wes Anchises, And in þat ile enterit wes; And quhen Anchises dede wes þus Eneas and Ascaneus, On set purpose sekirly For till haue bene in Ytaly, Wp to þe top þare salis drew, And saillit as þaim blastis blew, And quhill lay Romys costis out, As þai were stad with stormys stout; And quhill lay neir for till haif sene Quhat land at þai had nerrest bene; And at þe last þus sailland sa Off forss þai aryvit in Affrica, Quhare Dido þan of it wes quene. And fra scho had Eneas sene Scho him ressauit with honour, And luffit him straitly paramour, And gert all hir hie ryalte Till him and his obeyand be. Thare soiornand a quhile he baid, Quhare alkin welth at will he had; Bot all his ?arnyng halely Wes till haue bene in Ytaly. Tharfor his schippis he laid to se, And waittit wynd and maid entre, And tuke vp saill and held þar traid In Tyber till he strykin had. Quhare, as Eneas slepand lay Vpone a nycht in his galay, A voce he herd at bad him pass Till Ewander at þat tyme was King regnand in vii. hillis by, Quhare Rome is set now veraly, And bad at he suld suppowall To þis Ewander, þat batall Gaif to king Latyne ythandly; For þe kinrik of Ytaly Off all þat his suld be. Vpone þis purposs passit he Till þis Ewander with his mycht, And faucht with king Latyne in fycht; And Turnus in þat fecht has slane, That king wes þat tyme of Tuskane, And mayghe wes to þis king Latyne, And had weddit his dochter Lavyne. And for þat caus to þat batall This Turnus come in suppowall Off Latyne king, and slew Pallas, That of Ewander sone þan was; And throu Eneas þan wes he Slane of forss in þat melle. Eneas þan weddit Lawyne, The dochter of þis king Latyne; And quhen þat Latyne king wes deid, He succedit in his steid As king, regnand ?eris thre; And efter him, quhen deid wes he, His sone Ascaneus tuke alhaill Off Ytaly þe gouernall, And biggit þare a gret cete, And Alkane gert it callit be; And auchtene winteris regnand wes Efter his fader Eneas; For out of Troy with him come he, Gottin and borne in þat cuntre. His sone callit wes Siluyus, The quhilk wes fader to Brutus, That þis land fra gyantis wan, And efter him wes callit Brettane. Off Troy quhen þat Eneas Buskit him with schip to pass, Autenor and his men?e With þare navyne tuk þe se, And aryvit in Pannony, That merchit neir Wngary. Off Wenys he maid, þe gret toune That ?it is ryall of renovne, And a port of þe Mekle Se, Quhare þat pilgrimys may entre, That to Ierusalem wald faire, The sepultur to visit þare. Off þis Antenor come syne, Descendand evin doune be lyne, Francus of a ryall fame, That Frans of ?it has þe name. Thus come þai first al halely Off þe gret toune of Troy suthly, And Ytaly syne occupyit, And Frans and Brettane inhabit, And vþer mony landis seire That we leif now to rekin heire. CHAPTER XXXVI. Heir makis þe autour mentioun Off folkis to knaw þar generatioun. Moyses, þat in till his dawis Gaif to þe Iowis þar writtin lawis, In precept gaif þaim opinly As writtin is in Vtronomy, Off þe Bibill þe first buke, Fra þe begynning quha will luke. He biddis þaim þus in Latyne leid, And is on Inglis as we reid: Memento dierum, haif mynd of dais, Antiquorum, of ald, he sais; Haif thocht of ilk generatioun As thai fell in successioun; Ask at þi fader quhat it fell, And at þe elderis þat can tell. The sentens of þis auctorite Suld mufe men besy for to be To kene þar statis originall, And þaim to trete memoriall, Baith of þar elderis and þar dais, As in þir versis þus Moyses sais: Interroga patrem tuum, et annunciabit tibi, Maiores tuos, et dicent tibi, etc. Our elderis we suld follow of det, That þare tyme in vertu set; Carp we bot litill and rycht warly Off þaim þat liffit viciously. The dais suld be set for terme A certane purposs till afferme; Sa stablist haif I my delite Consequent now till endite With delitable ordinance, And in till conuenient plesance, The tyme þat Brutus [wan] þis yle, And callit it Brettane sen þat quhile, And the diuisyonis of it þat he Maid syne till his sonnys thre; Sa furþ drawand my purposs Be diuerss storyis for till close It in the tyme, as men can se, That maid of Rome wes the cete. This in forme to speid and haist The vertu of the Haly Gaist Throu prayeris of the madin fre I call in þis neid to help me. CHAPTER XXXVII. Off þe Iowis in Israell And how Sangaris slauchter fell. Qwhen þe assege of Troy fell Iowis raiss in Israell, And our þe pepill chosin wes Duke and chiftane þan Iudas. The lord of Be?ell þan wes tane, And his fingeris euer ilkane And ane of his tais with The vtmast endis be þe lith Quyt wes smyttyn of þaim; he Said: “Þis I trow now done to me Be Goddis will, for quhilum I Off kingis ryall had sevinty Vnderneth my burd all set, Sekand crummys for till ete, Mankit all in like manere, As now my caise is happinnit here; Forthy of Goddis will, I trow, Is all done þat I suffer now.” The king of Moabe than, Aglone, Had vnder him in subiection The folkis of Israell xviii. ?ere, Quhillis Ayot begouth to steir; The quhilk sa waldin wes in fecht That baith þe left hand and the rycht He evinlike vsit, quhen that he Wes stad in weir or in melle; And for þat vse þan gert he ma A scharp suerd with egis twa. Syne fra the folkis of Israell thare He presentis and gret giftis baire Till this Eglone þat tyme king, That Moab had in gouernyng. All oþer on dreich þan gert he draw His chargis till þat he suld schaw; That samyne suerd þat tyme had he One his rycht syde in prevate, Wnder his govne, and syne onone He tuke his raise to this Eglone, And said till him it was his will A word he had to say him till. Off his chyare quhairin he sat This king Eglone lowtit wiþ þat; Than Ayot tit out full smertly His suerd at he baire prevely, And put it in his wambe sa fast Till it in to þe plomat past, And left it stekand in his belghe; The carll wes fat as ony selghe, Than gore and cresche ran till his hand, Till he with suerd was him stekand. His men?e þan withoutin dout, That wes the chalmer þan without, Wenyt the king had sittand bene One þe preve, withoutin weyne; And quhen þai had biddin lang tharout Than wer þai ferd for him but dout; And in gret hy a key thai gat, And opinit þe chalmer dure with þat; In þai come and slane thai fand Thare king apoun þe scheild sittand, And fra þai þus gatis fand him deid, Disparit thai wer and will of reid; But mair bydyng þan tuke þai Till Ayot all the nerrest way. In þis meynetyme full prevely Ayot eschapit, and in hy Fled fast quhill he passit weill All the placis euerilk deill That þare ydolis þan had, And in his cummyng þan he maid. Off Israell þe pepill all He gert in hy befor him call, And with thame passit to Iordane, And all the furdis euer ilkane Off that watter he kepit sa That fully x. thousand and ma Off þe Moabytis þare Slane about the watter war. Sangar, as the Bible sais, Slew with a cultur in thai dais Off þe Philestenys wicht Sex hundreth throu forss in fecht. Baragh als and Delbora Than maid þat chaiss till Sythia, Quhare þat Ioell him ressauit In till [hir] tent and him dissauit. He askit a drink of watter clere To gif him, gif hir willis wer, For he wes all for rynnyng hat, And oure drawkit all with swat. Suete mylk þan scho gaif him till, And bad him thare of drink his fill, And happit him syne and gert him ly Wnder a carpit prevely, And said scho his wache suld be, And nane suld wit at þare were he. With that to þe dure in hy Scho tuke hir raik rycht hastely, And fand outwith it on þe wall A hammyr and a naill withall, And syne waittit and tuke keip Quhill he wes routand fast on sleip; The naill þan on his heid scho set, And straik on fast þat mal?et, Dryffand it doune throu his heid; Sa lost he thare his lif in þat steid. Off the folkis of Israell than [Gedeon] agane [Madyane] Chesit thre hundreth þat were Lapand watter as hundis there, And leit all þe laif ga by At he saw drinkand þan kyndly; And with thai thre hundreth quyt All about he discomfit. Amon bad he suld, but let, Off his houss quhat euer he met Nixt efter his victory Deuotly to God sacrify. Sa hapnit that his dochter ?ing, With tympanys and with suete singing, Quhen cummyn fra þe fecht wes he, Met hir fader hecht Iepte; Than in hert trow he wes wa; ?it sone he had oblist sa Set him his sacrifice to do, And to that assentit scho; Bot first þat scho mycht murnand be Twa moneth hir virginite; Leif þare to he gaif hir sone, And scho, als fast as þat wes done, Till hir fader come agane, And he till sacrifice has hir slane. CHAPTER XXXVIII. Off Sampsonis forse and his wichtnes And of his dissaving but less. Syne wes Sampsone of renovne, And fellit the forse of a lyoune; For as he with his fader ?eid And with his moder in his ?outhheid, With a wif to maryit be, All but þare witting that did he. Sa efter quhen he was Weddit with that wif of cass, Him hapnit to cum to that steid Quhare he wist þe lyoun deid; A gret swarme of beis thare Hyvit vp in his chaftis ware. Off þat best þan gredely He tuke and ete of þe hony; Till his fader syne he ?eid, And till his moder full gud speid, And gert þaim of þat hony eit. Efter þat syne at the meit Quhare his wiffis frendis haill Assemblit were at þat bridall, That his eld fader till him maid, In þat land thai custome had, Off his wiffis kyne thretty, The noblest in that cumpany, Assignit till him wes to be, As feris in all honeste. Than to thai xxx. at the meit, As thai ware in þare greis set, He said gif thai wald vndo [Redill] that he suld schaw thaim to Within vii. dais of þat bridall With kyrtillis xxx. garmondis haill He suld gif þame to þare meid, And fal?eit þai, þai suld, but dreid, Xxx. sic garmondis till him pay. To þis þan assentit þai, And bad þat he suld say þaim till Quhat at euer wes in his will. “I bid na langare it delay, This is þe thing þat I wald say: Off him deid þe meit come out, And suetnes of him stark and stout.” Sampsone said þis, and syne thai Fra þis wes said held on þar way, And stodyit on þis redyll heire Till þe terme wes cummyn neire; And quhen thai saw be nakyne slycht That þis redall thai red mycht, All thai thretty come onone Till the wif of þis Sampsone, And bad scho suld on ony wiss Fleche hir husband for quayntise, Till þat he suld all þat dout Off þat redill tell hir out; And scho to þaim suld tell it haill, Sa þat thai ryne nocht in tinsaill, Or ellis þai suld hir houses bryne, And all þat euer were þare in; For thai said wiþ ane assent Gif þai were in þat entent To fest callit, þat thai suld be Dispul?eit, it were vnhoneste. This wif sa on hir husband ?eid, That him worthit apon neid Tell hir all þe suthtfastnes, Set langtyme he gruchand wes, Excusand him be þis skill That it wes neuer in his will Till his fader it to say, Na till his moder to that day. Till his wif ?it neuerþeles He tald how it hapnit wes, Off þe lyoune þat he levid Slane, and fand syne in his hevid A byke of beis, and gret copy In it he fand of sueit hony. To thai xxx. þan, but baid, Scho tald all as he tald hir had; Sua apon þe sevint day, As sittand at þe mete were thai, And were examynit throu Sampsone, Thai ansuerd him þan all as one: “Quhat þan þe lyoune is starkare, And quhat þan hony is suetare?” Be þat Sampsone wist rycht weill He wes dissauit ilka deill, And said, “Had nocht ?our telche bene wrocht With my quhy, ?it had ?e nocht Fundin my propositioun;” As quha say of þis hid ressoune, “My wif has tald it ?ow but faill, And kepit ?ow out of tinsaill.” And quhen þis redill wes vndone Fra þin he past till Askolone sone, And xxx. men þat he fand thare, That riche robis on þame baire, All slew he, and thaire robis fyne He gaif to thai xxx. syne That he had hecht to warisone, For thai assol?eit his questioune. Bot till his wif he kest sic leth That thai departit all in wreth, And wes dispituouse and felloune Till hir and till hir natioun, And one seire wiss thaim anoyit And all thare cornis haill he stroyit. For he muffit efter þat, Thre hundreth foxis quhill he gat, And to thare taillis knyt þe fyre Off byrnand schydis brycht and schyre, And set þaim in þare flattis gret That were baith of wyne and quhete; And all thai wild foxis þan, As thai were wod throu flattis ran With thai blesis our all quhare, Till at thare cornys brynt vp ware. Than þe Philisteis haill, That tholit þat scaith and tinsaill, Were muffit all in birnand ire, And Sampsonis house thai set in fyre; His wif and hir syre atanys All thai brynt vp in þat wanys. That Sampsone, þat sa gret scaith had, In till a coif his wonnyng maid, And Philisteis of weire Sone assemblit thare powere, And in the land of Iuda thai Come with thare oste and in it lay, And tuke gret prayis to þar mete, And wrocht in till it scaithis grete; And quhen the barnage of Iuda Resonit þaim quhy thai did sa, Thai said the causs wes of þar come To byde and leid away Sampsone, And to quyt him lill for law. Off Iuda þe barnage aw Oblist þaim him for to ta, Or thai were anoyit sua. Than Philistenis haill Removit fra þin thare batall. Thre thousand wichtmen of Iuda Passit with new rapis to ta And for to bynd this Sampsone fast; And as thai samyn till him past, Sampsone met þaim in the way And askit quheþer wart wald thai, And thare ansuere wes þat he Suld bunding and deliuerit be Till his fais, for thai ware For his saik anoyit saire; And, for þat thai suld nocht him sla, He ?auld him to þaim of Iuda. Thare wes he tane and bundin fast, And with him on thare way thai past, And quhen þe Philisteis of þat Off his taking wittering gat, Bolnyt all with brag and bost, Agane him come with all thare ost; Bot Sampsone quhen he saw þaim neire Cummand all on that manere, With a tyt thare brak he all Thare rapis in till pecis small, And gat a cheke bane of ane ass, That in the hie way lyand was, And fra he gat it in his grip He laid about him quhip for quhip, Till of þe Philisteis wicht Thre hundreth neire to deid wes dycht With þat chek bane of þe ass; And Sampsone, that forfochtin was, Sa hait and thristy neire wes he Wes in poynt to perischit be. To God his prayere maid he þan, Syne throu his grace he wichtnes wan, Quhare throu his fais he put to deid, As thare wes sene in to that steid, That he wald, gif his willis were, Grant him his fill of watter cleire, Quhare with he mycht slokin his thrist. Rycht sodanely þan begouth to brist Out of the toith of þat cheke bane Watter cleire in weill gret wane; Thare of þan he drank his fill, And fra þin he passit till The gret cete of Gaza, A quhill his quyet thare to ta. Thare till a woman ?oung and faire He vsit oft to mak repaire, And quhen þe Philisteis, but let, Wist þat he maid þare resset, Thai enbuschit þaim neire by That womanis chalmer prevely, And set þare wache for to se Quhen vnarrayit all wes he, That sa thai mycht him best supprise; And he, vnwarnyt of thare spyise, With þat woman went to bed, As he nocht of thare buschment dred. Bot that nycht or it wes day, Thai him maid a felloune fray, Quhill to þe ?ettis of forss he past, That lokit were and barrit fast, And thare he made sa huge a rak Till con?e and rabet baith he brak, And bruschit vp thai ?ettis thare, And on his schulderis vp thaim baire To the hie hill of Hebrone, And þus gatis chapit thare Sampsone. Syne vsit he repaire to ma Till a woman callit Dalida, And scho amang þar previteis Counsalit throu Philisteis, In hir flecheing thraly muffit, Scho askit oft, as he hir luffit, Quhare in his forss stude and his pygh, And quhat gif he were bunding with Mycht hald him fast till þat he Mycht at his fais willis be. And quhen he persauit he wes Sa thraly throu his wantones Wexit, sa þat him behuffit Mak hir ansuere, þan he [contruffit], And fen?eit and þus said: “With vii. cordis þat new were laid Off hert sennonis nocht all dry, Bot sowpill, sagatis fast were I, Bot dout bunding I were þan, And mycht na mare þan a commoun man.” And þe Philisteis herd þat, In hy þare cordis all thai gat, And scho þaim held and tuke gud keip Till he wes sadly fallin on sleip, And with a hank þan baith his handis Fast scho festynit with thai bandis, And syne scho cryit lowd with a schout: “Sampsone, þi fayes ar þe about!” Sampsone of his sleip with þat Wakynnit and on his feit gat, And with a rug thai rapis all He rakkit in to pecis small; And quhen þis woman þis had sene, Scho murmurit fast and maid hir tene, And of hir wickit wordis plen?eit, For all in falset luf he fen?eit Till hir þat for his luf alhaill Had put hir body to tinsall. Bot in hir fleching syne agane Quhen Dalida maid hir to pleyne Off þe causs haill of his pighe, And quhat were his vndoing with, Than him worth of neid ma Ansuere till hir and said, quha Wald bynd him with twa bandis grene, All new, that neuer in werk wes sene, He suld be na wichtare þan Than ane oþer commone man. With thai rapes þan scho him band Fast in his sleip baith fut and hand, And with a schout cryit him on: “Thy fais ar on þe now, Sampsone!” Than in his wakenyng with a braid Thai twa new bandis on him laid He brak and gat apon his feit. With þat scho brissit out of greit, And menyt hir wickit wordis ware, That brocht hir in noye and caire, That scho couþ neuer leif Sampsone To be maid lady of Sydone. “For it is lyking and na payne To luf and to be luffit agane; Bot for luf to ?eild bot fen?eing It is,” quod scho, “bot mystrowing. Sa fallis it of me Dalida, That changeit has my weill for wa, Off hert and body, of kyne and kyth, And of all warldis welth þarewith; For Sampsone I haif maid a change, And he to me is alway strange, And has me in to mysleving, And for leill luf ?eildis me fen?eing.” And ?it þus murnand neuerþeles Scho franyt mare of his wichtnes, Quhare in it stude, and how þat he Mycht lychtlye ouercummyn be. Than he said gif scho wald bynd Sevin haris of his heid behind With a threid till a spykyne, And in þe erd fast stik it syne; Than were he feble and of na pigh, Na nocht had for to help him with. At þe thrid tyme scho assayit, And of his sleip syne him affrayit, And he tyt vp na nalis with pyth, And left baith haire and threid thaire with. Quhen scho saw hir þe thrid tyme sa Dissauit, þan scho maid gret wa, That scho wes like till haif bene dede, As scho were but comfort or remeid. Than Sampsone, movit in pete, Tald hir all in prevate That gif sevin haris of his heid War shavin of and nane levid, Off pigh and wichtnes he wes þan Bot as ane vþer commone man. Sone efter þat apon a day Sampsone þat wery wes away Apone hir kne scho gert him sleip, And till hir tyme scho tuke gud keip; And gert [slely] get a barbour, And schufe of all his haire þat houre, And þe Philistiis in hy Scho gert cum on him sodanely, That tuke him and his ene put out, And thare efter withoutin dout Thai put him in a deip prisoune. Sa lang he lay in þat dungeoun Till on his heid þe haire grew, And his pygh worthit fresche and new. And as þe Philistiis on þare wiss To Dagone maid þare sacrifiss Apone a day with gamyn and gle, With myrth and wiþ solempnyte, In to þare hall as þai were set That day all samyn at þe mete, A boy thai gert call onone And bad him ga bring in Sampsone, That he mycht thare bourdour be, In eking of þare gamyn and gle. And quhen he wes among þaim all Brocht in to þat mekill hall, He requyrit with faire prayere The boy þat him kepit there To thole him bot a litill space, Sen he wery for standing was, To leyne him till a pyllere thare, Quhill þat he refreschit ware. Than þis boy but langere let Sampsone at þe piller set; Than prayit he to God of mycht That for þe tinsall of his sicht A revengeance he mycht sene Off all his fais at wes þare in. About twa pillaris þan but let, At þat gret hall was on set, He kest his armes hastely, And tuggit at þaim dogitly, And said: “My lif in perell ga With þir Philisteis, and sla.” The post he tit till him sa fast Quhill doune þat houss fell at the last, And smorit all þat wes thare in, Man and wif, baith mare and myn, And him self amangis þe laif Wes smorit with þaim and þe knaif. Sa slew he ma in his deing Than all that he slew in fechting. In Israell þan wes na king Bot ilk man did his awne liking. CHAPTER XXXIX. Quhen Brutus come first in Brettane And wan it all wiþ mycht and mayne. Schir Dardanus, lord of Frigy, That now men callis all Turky, Had a sone wes hecht Arconus, As þe story tellis ws, Off quham come Troius, at Troy maid, And of him þat name it had; He gat Ylis, þat Ylioun Foundit, and he Leamedoun That Priame gat [and] Anchises, That Eneas fader wes; And þis Priame nemmyt befor Wes fader vnto gud Hector, That wes sa wycht and sa worthy That neuer ?it in chevalry Hyere ?eid nane na his persoune, Tharfor ?it lestis his renovne. Eneas sone Ascaneus Had a sone callit Siluius, That Brutus gat, of quham beforne Wes devynit or he wes borne, That of gret worschip he suld be, And ryss to stait and dignite, Bot he suld fader and moder sla. And of cass it fell rycht sa; For his moder at his bering Deit of him but lesing; Quhen he wes xv. ?eris of cass He slew his fader at þe wanless; And therfor out of þat cuntre Fra kyth and kyn flemyt wes he. Quhen þat þis Brutus flemyt þus wes, Furth towart Grece þe way he tais, Quhare mony of Troy a wele lang quhile Had bene in thraldome and exile. Fra thai gat wittering þare þat he Be lynage wes of þat cuntre, Thai maid him thare lord and ledare, And fra he wist weill how thai ware Demanyt in to foull thraldome, He muffit weire for thare fredome. Sa hapnit him to ta the king, And anyd for his ransonyng For to gif þat tyme him till Schippis and wittail at his will, And vþer riches till his men; And syne his dochter Ynogen He gaif him þare to be his wif. He buskit him, and þat belif, And to þe se has tane his way, Quhare þat he travalit mony day In weyth and weire and in bargane Till he had enveround all Spane. Syne, efter sindry gret melle, To Poytiris in to France come he, In þe tyme þat ?e herd me tell That Sampsone raxit in Israell. In till Abyone belife He come, quhare nouþer man na wif Bot xxiiii. gyantis he fand. Till him he sessit all þis land, And maid it ryall and of gud fame, And callit þis land efter his name, And it inhabit with his men, And gat apone this Ynogen A sone Lucryne and oþer twa, Cambar and Albanac were thai. The eldest sone Ingland aucht, Cambar Waillis, syne Albanacht In Scotland aucht the sen?eory. Than Ingland callit wes Locry, And Camber Cambry þat Waillis aucht Gert call it, and syne Albanacht Gert Albany he callit that land That now callit is Scotland. Thus Brut gert Brettane partit be Amangis his forsaidis sonnis thre, And biggit in his land a tovne, ?it ryall and of gret renovne, And Tronowant þat tyme gert he Call þe name of þat cete, New Troye þat is to say. Syne quhen þis Brut wes ded away, With vthere nationis seire, I wiss, Lundone to name it callit is. All þus quhen thire breþer thre Had stedit þame in þare degre, And in all quyet and in pece Ilkane in his regnand wes, Sodanely come oure þe se Off Hannagoss a gret men?e Be nawyne in till Albany, Arrayit in a cumpany, And stoutly muffit weire and faucht, And slew of Scotland Albanacht, And banyst his men alhalely To Locryne þat lord wes of Locry, That Ingland wes callit syne. His oste þan semblit þis Locryne, And Camber with þe Welchis all Come to mak him suppowall, And with the Hannagoise facht, That slew þe king Schir Albanacht. Thai met þe watter of Humber neire; Thare Lucryne and his powere Thai mellit sone and facht rycht fast, Till thai him vencust at þe last; And on þis king thai maid sic chass Quhill in þat flude he drownyt was. His land callit wes Hunya, Hunys his men were callit alsua; And quhare sa mony drownyt were That watter is callit ?it Humber. Quhen Albanacht apon this wiss Wes slane, as ?e me herd deviss, Scotland wes dissewer left, And waist neire lyand lang thare eft, Quhill Scotis and Pightis were Cummyng in it, as ?e sall heire In till þat tretiss here efter sone, Quhen all þe laif till it is done. This Lucyne had sonnis twa, Mempryss and Malyne callit were thai: Malyne wes worthy, bot Mempriss Smyttit wes with mony vice. His broþer he slew and syne all thai That he trowit wald þaim ma For to succeid till him as king. It happinnit syne at a hunting With wolffis him weryit to be; Sa endit his iniquite. His sone Eubrait in his steid Regnyt quhen þat he wes deid. He foundit ?ork þat gret cete, And Traboc gert it callit be. He biggit Edinburgh withall, And Alynclud he gert it call, The Madin Castell, in sum place The Sorowfull Hill it callit wes. Off Brutus lynnage quha will heire, ?e luke the tretiss of Barbere, Maid in till ane genology, Rycht weill and mare perfitly Than I can on ony wiss With all my wit to ?ow deviss. Bot now, or þat I forthire pass, I will ?ow tell how Eneas, For he had slane þe king Latyne, He weddit his dochter dame Lawyne, And gat apone hir Postumus, That wes alsua callit Siluyus. He wes callit Postumus, for beforne His fader deit or he wes borne; Siluyus alsua callit wes he Thare of the wod has propirte, For in þe wod he fosterit was. His sone wes callit Eneas; He regnyt xxx. ?eris and ane, Quhen all his fader tyme wes gane, And fifty ?eris he regnyt syne. Eneas sone wes callit Latyne. Gad þat tyme and Nathane Prophetis were contemperane To Dauid king of Israell; And that tyme Cartage, I herd tell, Dido first gert foundit be, And wallit weill all þat cete. Hir gudame luffit Eneas; Off all Affrik scho lady was. Heire the thrid eild now takis end, That, as the Hebrewis makis it kend, Contenys fully nyne hundreth ?eris And twa, gif all weill reknyt were; Bot the sevinty clerkis wiss Sais twa less be thare storyiss, As fra the tyme of Noyis spait Thare vse wes for to set þare dait, As now our vse is in letteris, Monumentis, and als charteris, To rekyne fra þe byrth of God, As ?eris rynnis evin or od. CHAPTER XL. Off Latyne kingis genology Heir it tellis wele and schortly. Latyne, king of Ytaly, Efter þe tyme of Sanct Dawy Gat this Siluyus onone In to the dais of Salamone. In Rome he regnyt xxx. ?eris, And all þir þat þus reknyt were, Discendand fra Postumus, That had to surname Siluyus. Achis, þat callit wes Egiptus, And als to surname Siluyus, In Rome foure and twenty ?ere Regnyt, quhen devisit were The kinrikis of Israell and Iuda; Ieroboame had ane of þai; King he wes, and in his dais To styfyne fell, þe story sais; King of Israell þan wes he Quhen Ieroboame regnyt in Iude. Apis Siluyus, but weire, In Rome viii. and xx. ?ere As lord rignyt, quhen Assa Wes king regnand in Iuda. That tyme in till Champane he Gert found and mak a gret cete. In Rome Carpent efter that Regnyt, quhen þat Iosaphat Wes of Iuda lord and king. And syne of Rome þe gouernyng Tiberius tuke, and wes of it Nyne ?eris lord, as sais þe writt.

The watyr of Tyber þan alsua Wes callit to name Albula, Befor þat þis Tiberius, As tellis Titus Lewyus, Drownyt wes in þat ryvere; Thai callit it Tyber syne but weire. In Rome syne regnyt Agripa Quhen Achas regnyt in Iuda, And [Homer], as the story sais, Wes in to Grece in to thai dais. Syne regnyt in Rome Arromelus, That had to surname Siluyus; Nynetene winteris regnit he Quhen Ioas king wes of Iude. Thre and thretty winter syne Efter him regnyt Awentyne; In his tyme Omasyas King of Iuda regnand wes. CHAPTER XLI. Off the successioun of Perss And of Sardanapallus to reherss. Aucht hunder winter and sextene Or God wes borne of Mary clene, All the land of Assyry Sardanapallus halely Aucht be lyne of heretage Evin discendand be lynage Fra Nynus þat befor wes king, That had þat land in gouernyng. His vse wes mare to roll and spyne Than thai landis to corne to wyne; Off weissing vss mare thocht þan he had How mony heire the spyndall maid, Than for to blasoun in to weire Quhat his knychtis vsit to beire, Armes of thare ancestry, Or ony dedis of chevalry. Off Mede kinrik than in cheif With alkyne seruice and releif Arbitus held of þis king, The quhilk had lang tyme gret ?arnyng This Sardynapallus till haif sene, And of his duelling till haif bene, And till haif had of him reward, Sen in to cheif he wes his lard Off all þe kinrik of Medey; Off kynd his hert luffit forthy Befor ony vthere lard To mak him seruice for reward. Wpone this purposs till assay, To serve his lord in gud array, He buskit him richt honestly, And weill arrayit his cumpany, And to the tovne of Babilone With his court he come anone. Innys he socht and gat rycht thare, And maid him rially to faire Bydand oportunyte Off tyme his ourlord for to se. Sa in the castell on a day He come in till his best array, With all his court and his men?e, Commendit of all honeste, Quhare he wenyt for till haif sene Lordis cled in rede and grene, Knychtis, ladyis and squyeris, Halkis, hundis and courseris, And thare lord in faire array Amangis thame in ioy or play; Than he fand with drury dowd Amang a pak of carlingis lowd Flytand redy for to fecht, For he wes wantand of his wecht, His ?arne spunnyng ressavand, And tow to spynnyng deliuerand. Quhen Arbitus his lord had sene Apon þis wiss, he wes full teyne, And remuffit fra him in hy, And haue agane past in Medy. Thare his oste he gaderit sone, And past till Babilone but hone, And with þis Sardynapallus facht, And tuke him with full mekle maucht, And gert mak on a mekle fyre, And gert schydis bernand schyre, And Sardanapallus kest tharin, And warp and weft all gert he bryne, And gert thaim all of Assyry Mak hym homage halely, And hald thar land of him in cheif Fra þin with seruice and releif, And trewage to the Medes pay That held of thaim befor þat day. This wes þe first confusioun That euer fell to Babilone, That wes befor mast principall Off þe first foure kinrikis haill, And stude sa ix. hundreth ?eir And foure and sexty thar to cleire, In worschip honour and in stait, Till þe tyme þat þis Arbait Maid þis riffill, and fra þat day Babalone wes fal?eand ay. Thus in sege a sot wes he And dowd in to dignite, That but wit or worschip lost That his elderis wan wiþ oste. It is oure tyrand for to tell How mony changeingis þat tyme befell Betuix the lordis of Assyry And the lordis of Medy, Quhill ane, quhill oþer, tributere, As than happinnit throu werd of weire, Till Ioracas of Italy Hald all þe lordschip halely. CHAPTER XLII. How wiffis monyst thar men so fast That þai agane to þe batall past. Syne efter þat tyme Forutes Lord of Medy and syre wes, And regnyt xxii. ?ere, Assayit oft in weris were. Till him succedit Diocles, That in all dedis douchty wes; Seire landis lyand him about Till Medyis he maid vnderlout. Assrages syne efter þat Off Medye all þe lordschip gat, That airis maill of his body Gat nane, and of þat land forthy His dochter sone his aire he maid; To proper name Cerus he had, That with fellonne fecht and batall Forbaire na thing for till assaill And he þan in his reklesnes For?et the myss þat he had done Till Arpallas, quhen he his sone Had slane, and syne gert him be set Forouth his fader at þe met, In quarteris lyand on a weschall For precius spicis fersit weill. Bot he gert all raw be leiffit Baith the handis and the hevid, The quhilk he gert þe fader se Quhen of the body full wes he, And lewgh at him dispitously In hething of that maniory. Bot all þe cure of his haill batall, And of his oste þe gouernall He lipnyt till þis Arpallus, The quhilk be tressoune till Cyrus ?ald þaim, and þan Astrages, That in his hert all angry wes, His oste assemblit hastely, And on þe Persantis douchtely He duschit sa in till þat fycht, Mony doure till deid wes dicht, Cryand fast þat he suld dye Quha euer him schupe abak to fle. Thare þe Medis were sa fell, And on Persantis sa cruell That mony douchty thai gert dee; The laif on bak begouth to fle. That Medis nere hand had þe feild, Ne were þe wiffis þat beheld And saw the Persantis in þat batall, How fayntly þai begouth to faill; To stand thai maid þaim faire prayere And comfort þaim on all manere; Bot þe Persantis were sa rad, For in the press þai were sa stad That thai were doutand all to de; Forthi þai schupe þaim all to fle. Than all thai wiffis with a cry Repruffand þaim dispitously, Tit vp þare clathis attour thare scheire, And poyntit to thare preve geire That betuix thare lymmis stude, And with a schout as þai were wod: “In heire, in heire, sene ?e ar rad, And in sa stamerand stait ar stad, ?one folkis ar felloune for þe nanys, (Thus raopit thai with a rare atanys,) Sen oþer succour haif ?e nane, Na ?e can se na better wane, Giff ?e will ?our liffis keip, In oure kocekane cum and creip; In heire in gif ?e hyde ?our heid All þe body mon out be levid.” The Persantis all þan schamyt were, And turnyt all agane but mare, And with þe Medis facht sa fast Till þai þaim wencust at the last, And of þaim slew a gret party, And wan the feild rycht douchtely; And thare þai tuke þis Astrages, Till Cerus he deliuerit wes, The quhilk maid him halely Lord and syre of Ircany, Bot Medis and þe landis þare To Perss fra þin wes tributere; Bot ?it were citeis sindry That aucht trewage to Medy, The quhilk in to Cerus dayis Payit nocht tharefor allwayis. This Cerus wes in gret travall, And muffit weire with hard batall. CHAPTER XLIII. Off þe fell tyrand Falaryne That vsit ay innocentis to pyne. Falaryne of Sa?ill þan Wes in his dedis a felloune man; The Angrigentynis halely He vndid þaim rycht fellonly. Angrigent wes a regioun Famouss and of gret renoune Within þe se in till ane ile Thare is þe kinrik of Se?ill. This Falaryne wes of dedis fell, Off his entent huge cruell; Till him wes indiffere[n]t Culpable in payne and innocent; For ay in a delite wes he Men pvnyst wiþ panys for to se, And for to se thare countynance That þai wald mak in thare pennance He euer in to þis liking stude. Sa neire him by wes a smyþ gud, Perillus callit; within his land The smyth ay duelt his craft vsand, And set alhaill his deligens Till haue had þe benevolens Off þis tyrand, that wes ware To wyne na tyme all out be fere, And now seire lordis of renovne Ar commone of condicioun. This smyth þat kend of þis tyrand Quhat thing till him wes plesand, Maid and forgit a bull of brass, That large and holl within was, And sa rowme within wes it That a man vprycht mycht sit Within, for it wes maid sa wyde, With a dure opinnand at þe syde, Ordanit all for thare entre That within suld pvnist be, And first to be lokit without, And a gret fyre maid about Suld ger þaim pynit within raire Rycht as a nolt, quhat man he ware. This lome he maid apone þis wiss, Polist faire and rycht fetiss; This smyþ it brocht vnto presand To this wickit tyrand Falaryne, that all about Saw it weill baith in and out, And gert him all þe faltis mend That mycht be sene in it or kend; Syne gert this ilk smyth in ga To preif the lenth and breid alsa, And gert syne steik the dure without, And kyndillit fyre it all about Off thornys and of schydis gret; And quhen the smyþ within fled het Pynand him ay mare and mare, Off neid behuffit him to rare Sa þat he like wes in it to rout In his ded thraw till a nowt; The fyre outwith kyndillit sa fast Till þe smyþ inwith at þe last With panys strang, without remeid, Within his handwork wes dede; Sa causs and mater baith gaif he Till his deid and his cruelte; And þis tyrand, the story sais, With pynis endit his last dais. CHAPTER XLIV. Off Olimpias þe manere In this place now may ?e heire. Sevin hundere winter and foure score And fully sevinty ?eris befor Or God of Mary borne wes, In Grece þe faire Olimpias In þe honour of Iupiter Wes ordanit ilk fift ?ere; And for þis causs it ordanit thai At þai termes, but delay, At þai for?et it nocht on na wiss, And at þe cost less suppriss At thai termes þan within, And he þat mycht nocht manheid wyn At turnamentis or iusting, At playis or at a gret wersling, Or quhat vthire þat fyft ?ere In þe Olympi that cryit were, Thare suld be maid him na warnyng Off quhat kyne thing he maid asking. This thing a quhill in vse þai had, As in to sta[t]utis syne þai maid, That fra that constitutioun Thai maid in thare discriptioun Euerilk ?ere be ?ere the dait In ilk letter at þai wrait. Fra thin all þare inherdans In oiss thai held this ordinans, And for that Grece wes of gret fame, And rycht ryall wes of name, Befor the tyme of Romanis raiss That dait in all landis was; For flour in Grece wes of clergy, Off worschip and of chevalry; And forthy mony landis were Led be þare oiss and thare laire. Off Ytaly þe king Prochas Wes deid, and syne regnand was His sone þare efter Amelyus, That callit wes alsua Siluyus. He regnyt fourty ?eris and foure And banyst his broþer Mynatour, That had a dochter callit Rea. Scho wes deliuer of twynnis twa, Bot be the lawis neuerþeless All qwik in erd scho dolwyne wes, And hir twa twynnis hid þan were Wnder a bra be Tyber neire, Quhare a hyrd þan apon case, That Fasculus þan callit was, Hapnit to cum by that bra Quhare þat he fand þir twynnis twa, And to Laurencia his wif, That spendit in to lust hir lif, And mekle with hir body wan, For thi cho Lupa callit wes þan, For hir the bordailhouss wes syne Callit lupanar in Latyne, Thir twynnis till hir he brocht in hy, And bad her keip þaim tenderly; And with hir were thai fosterit thare, Quhill thai to manheid cummyn ware; And a scho wolf in Latyne Is callit Lupa þare efter syne In Rome, quhare þat thare figure Wes sene in auld tyme in sepulture, Or payntit, thai twa sowkand wes A wolf in to that liknes. Thir twa gaderit of rewaris, Off cheiffis and men murtheraris, A gret multitud in hy, And raiss of weire rycht stoutly, And slew Amelyus that befor Banyst thare eldfader Mynatour, And restorit thare grantschir Till his estait and his empyre. CHAPTER XLV. How Symone Breke of Span?e land Brocht the kingis stane first in Irland. In the meynetyme at this fell That ?e herd of thir brether tell, There wes regnand a mychti king That had all Span?e in gouernyng. This king mony sonis had, Off ane of thaim ?it maist he maid, That Symone Breke wes callit be name, Ane honest man and of gud fame. A gret stane þis king þan had, That for þis kingis sete wes maid, And wes haldin a gret iowell Within þe kinrik of Span?e haill. This king bad þis Symone ta This stane and in till Irland ga, Haue in þat land and occupy, And hald þat stane specially, And mak it his sege þare, As þai of Span?e did of aire. This Symone did þan as the king Had gevin him fully in bidding, And wan Yrland and chesit his place Quhare him thocht it maist likand wes, And thare he maid a gret cete, And in it syne þat stane gert he Be set and haldin for iowell And charter of þat kinrik haill. Fergus Erichsone fra him syne Doune discendand lyne be lyne In to þe fyfe and fifty gre, As in the genology men may se, Brocht þat stane in to Scotland, First quhen he come and wan þat land; And set it first in Ycomerkill, And Scone it efter wes brocht till; And there it wes syne mony day, Quhill king Eduard had it away With the langschankis, and it he In till Lundone gert set be, Efter þat Ihesu Crist wes borne To sauf ws all þat were forlorne A thousand and thre hunder ?ere And x. therto, or therby neire. All will I þe word reherss As I fynd of þat stane in verss: Ni fallat fatum, Scoti, quocunque locatum Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem. “Bot gif þat werdis fal?eand be, Quhare euer that stane ?e segit se, Thare sall þe Scottis be regnand, And lordis haill oure all þat land.” This Symone Brek efter þat Fyolak Bolgege to sone gat; And for to rekin þe genology Off þis Symone doune lynyaly, As thai discendit man be man, And quhat thare names were callit than, That were rycht strange for to reherss, As I fynd þame writtin in werss. It suld bot tary space and tyme, And ?e suld call it a lawd ryme; Forthy will I nocht thareon duell, Bot furþ my purposs for to tell Off seire cornyklis, as I fand Thame writtin autentik beand.

Be this clerkis auctorite A garland as a crovne suld be Wnderstanding with all rycht, For taking of worschip, stait or hycht. A crovne wes givin for victory In auld tyme; sanct Paull forthy Timotheum fairely prechit Off him self quhen he þus techit: Bonum certamen certaui, cursum consummaui, Fidem seruaui, de reliquo reposita est mihi corona iusticie, Quam reddet michi Deus in illa die, iustus iudex. “A gud strif,” he sais, “I began, And to gud end I brocht it þan; For quhy I faucht ay for the faith, And ay I kepit it in graith; Forthy þare is hecht to me The crovne of rychtuisnes full hie, The quhilk he þat is iuge verray Sall ?eild me apon domysday.” The hew of gret delite oftsyss Oyss or plesance signifyis. Quha the crovne þan will hald grene Off thaim þat has befor þaim bene, Draw þaim delite to heire or reid Thare famouss werkis done in deid; Sa, for excite ?our delite, I haue set me for to write And to trete in þis volome Quhen biggit wes be Romule Rome, That his brother Remus slew, First to lordschip quhen he drew, With oþer storyis incedentis Plesand till ?our reuerencis, That ?arnis thire tretyss to heire or reid.

Till hir sueit virginite This tretiss [I commend and] me, Till end my purposs so to bring That all redound to hir loving. CHAPTER XLVII. Quham throu þat Rome wes foundit first Heire may ?e fynd gif þat ?e list. Sevin hunder winter and fyftene Or God wes of þe madin clene Borne, and Olimpias The sext ordour regnand was, That in to Grece þan wes þare dait In all þe scriptouris at thai wrait, Off Rome þe gret cete wes maid, And of it haill the lordschip had Romule, that his brother slew Sone fra he to lordschip drew, And efter his awne name gert he Rome be callit that cete, And till him self that lordschip haill He tuke and in till gouernall, And wallit it rycht weill without With mud wall and with faill about. A hundreth men he chesit of eild, That waik were wappinnis for to weild, Bot for wit and gud counsall To thai he taucht þe gouernall Off the commone estait, and he Gert thaim senatouris callit be. Syne he chesit a thousand haill ?oung and manly to batall, And knychtis he gert call all thai; Thare name in Latyne soundis sa. Romule of eild wes xx. ?ere And twa quhen he begouth to steir In Rome, and regnand wes xviii. ?eris in till dedis kene, And syne efter he perist wes Thro? fell tempest and sodane caiss. Efter that deid wes Romulus Newma regnyt Pamphelyus Ane and fourty ?eris, and he First gert ordane knychtis fee. Befor him Marche wes, but weire, The first moneth of þe ?ere, Bot he gert þe monethis twa Ianuar be þe first of thai, The secund Februare, but let, All wayes befor Marche be set. In his tyme E?echias fre Wes king regnand in Iude. Sybile þan Erucea Wes in the tyme of this Newma. Efter him regnyt Tulius, Be surname callit Hostilius.

In till his tyme mekle of priss Wox Sybill Samya þe wiss. The king þan of Spartany The cete maid of Bysantty; Now thai vse in landis all Constantinople it to call. Efter the deid of Tulius In Rome regnyt the king Achus. In till his tyme Iosyas In till Iude regnand was; He gert mak a gret cete, And efter him it callit he. He regnyt xxiii. ?ere, And did proffitable dedis seire. Till him succedit his sone Priscus, That had to surname Tarqueus; He maid a bowrgis round in his dais Within þe tovne to vss all plais, As dansing, pyping and singing, Werstlyng, springing or iusting. Cisternis he gert be maid deip, Fylth or watter for to keip, That all þe glyt within þe tovne In tymes mycht be casting doune Throu þai cisternis for to ryne The gret watter of Tyber in, That þe cete mycht ay be Kepit in all honeste. The Capitole he first gert ma, And be name it callit sa, For, as þai were þe ground rypand, Off a deid corps þe heid thai fand Foroutin body, quharfor thai The Capitole it callit thai ay. In Rome he regnit xxx. ?ere, And aucht ?eris to thai passit were Quhen Ioachim in to Iude Wes king and held þat ryalte.

He wes þe first king, as thai say, That gert þe Romanis custum pay; Befor his tyme sat thai so fre That thai wist nocht quhat toll suld be. Syne wes slane this Serwyus Throu ane callit Tarqueneus The prowd, and quhen þat he wes deid He regnyt as king in his steid. In till his tyme Sedechias King of Iuda regnand was, And Nabagodonosor, he King þan regnyt in Caldee, Maid þe gret confusioun Off Iowis in þare distructioun. Now the ferd eild heire endis, The quhilkis of ?eris full expendis, As the Hebrewis comptis cleire, Foure hundreth and thre ?ere; The sevinty clerkis sais ?it our Foure hundreth ?eris fourty and four. CHAPTER XLVIII. Quhen Consules were chosin in Rome To be haldaris of law and dome. After þe deid of Seruyus In Rome þis proud Tarquineus Regnyt, and þan Cirus king Had of all Perss þe gouernyng. He wes a man of gret fellony, And vmbethocht him increly With quhat torment thai mycht be Punyst for þare iniquite, As fetteris or presonyng, Stokkis, boyis or bannysing. He wes exild in his dais Off Rome, as Frere Mertyne sais, For his sonnis iniquite, That had deforsit a lady fre, A gentill woman and of gud fame, Lucritia wes her proper name. Scho plen?eit till hir husband sone Off the defoull þat wes hir done, Till hir fader and hir kyne, Till all syne at scho mycht wyne, And leid hir a quhill in pyne, And slew hir self for sorow syne. And quhen þis proud Tarqueneus Saw þat he wes exilit thus, He knyt him þan to þe Tuskanis, And with thaim werrayit the Romanis, And with his oste apon a day To Tyber he come in gud array, And quhen thai saw his gret powere The Romanis affrayit were, Bot syne it happinnit þaim to be Accordit weill be faire tretie. Thir sevin kingis regnand were Twa hunder full and fourty ?ere; And fra thir kingis þus can cess In Rome thai chesit twa consules, And thai regne suld bot a ?ere, For dout gif thai regnand were Langere tyme, þat þare suld ryss In lordschip on sa hawtane wiss That the commonis willausly Suld be greiffit throu þare mastry. And twa wes ordanit for þis skill, That gif þe tane wald set his will For liking mesoure till exceid, The toþer argew suld his deid, And sagatis chastyit he suld be Fra his wilfull iniquite. Consules þus gatis thai maid twa, Brute and Lucyus callit were þai. That tyme in Rome Pictogoras, And þe wiss clerk als Socrates The venome drank and poysonit were. There cornykillis tellis þe manere; And Arestotill of eild þan wes Neire xviii. ?eris, withoutin less, And vnder Plato the witty Studyit in to philosophy. CHAPTER XLIX. How Babilone wes first distroyit Throu Cirus king of Perss anoyit. Sevin hunder ?ere and viii. beforne Or God wes of þe Madin borne, The first of þe consules, That Brute be name callit wes, The Sawynis in to stout array Maid þaim þe cete till assay; The Romanis þan a dytoure maid That oure þe laif þe mastry had, And þe consules be fer He suld exceid in to powere. In till þis tyme þat I reherss Cirus, þat wes king of Perss, Wan a gret part of Sythy And mony landis in Asy; Syne with his oste he come onone For till assege Babilone; Bot the ryvere þan of Eufrait Wes sa reich waxin with spait That he mycht nocht the toune cum neire, Bot worthit byde with his powere, Till thai welland wallis kene Suld in part haif swagit bene. Sa wes in till his oste a knycht ?oung and ioly, bald and wycht, Faire of fassoune and fetyss, Off prowess pruffit and of pryss, Off Capadoce callit Alarike. In all that oste wes nane his like, Sa faire of fassoune nor sa fre, And gentill in till all wes he. He luffit per drury Dame Sybile, That þan wes lady of Pamphill; He paramouris sa straitly luffit That all playis perelluse he pruffit. Apone a coursere pommill gray Adressaly he sat þat day In till a sariot schapin wyde, Off fassone sle bot sadill syde, With brokin letteris on þat govne Breiffit weill with þis ressoune Susais Ieta, that suld be, Leif at counsaill, think on me; And browdin weill in his pennovne Off gold a reid rampand lyoune That set wes in till asure brycht; His harnes flawmand faire to sycht. Thus all the oste thare huffing maid, And swageing of the watter baid. He thocht prowdly þat he wald prufe For hir quham on he set his luf; The coursoure hardnyt he with spuris, And wallopand oure flosche and furris Fere beforne þe oste he raid; There stend for stend the coursere maid, And at the bra all nerrest wes The furd quhare men vsit to pas, The horss he hardynit yrously; The coursour lap deliuerly All oure þe bank in to þe flude, Till þe stoure oure þare hedis stude. The waw wes wod, the watter deip, Be na forse mycht the knycht him keip; Bot, for to tell ?ow schortly þan, Thare drownyt wes baith horss and man. Than Cirus, at þis sicht has sene, For anger of hert and huge teyne That sa his knycht he lesit had, Gret athis soure and wowis maid Till all his goddis, ?oung and auld, That wynd and watter had in wald, That he suld of þat watter be Revengit in to sic degre, And sa schald it suld be maid That a woman suld it waid, And, for na wethyre, spring nor spait, Hir kneis for it suld nocht be wait. Than gert he draw þat ryvere all In foure hundreth and sexty small Narow swyrlis throu landis braid; That gret revere sa schald he maid Rynnand throu deip slyk and clay Wnto þe see þe nerrest way; And thare lay with his powere Till he the cete wan but weire, And gert cast all the wallis doune Off Babilone, baith toure and toune, That chemys wes of Assyry, And biggit at poynt properly, In till a land of fresche fawour, And hailsome aire, and gud sawour, With wod and watter all about, Plesand and faire, foroutin dout. A hundreth ?ettis of irne gret It had forout þe mekle ?et, And ma postremys mycht reknyt be All about that gret cete; And fra that mekle ?et befor Foure hundreth stadiis and foure skore It had in vngang all about, And þai to rekin are, but dout, Ane and fyfty mylis and maire, And all about þe wallis are Fife and twenty elnys of breid, With sekyr syment maid, but dreid, And ane hundreth elne on hycht, All at poynt perfitly dicht; And, as þe clerk Orosyus In his cornikillis tellis ws, That were bot fawtumlik and fable, And nocht till all men ?it trowable, That manis vertu or his wit Mycht ouþer do or vndo it, As of Babilonis toune or toure It wes sa huge as of valour. CHAPTER L. How Syrus can King Cressus sla, And how his dochter tald him sa. Qwhen thus wes wonyng Babilone, Cerus with his oste onone In Lydis past with plane batall The king Cressus þare till assaill. This Cressus, þat I now reherss, Held Lydis of the king of Perss, Bot ay till him he wes rebell In weire, and in to counsall fell; Bot for he were in dedis stout Cyrus of him ay had gret dout, For riche and mychti ay wes he, And in all dedis avysee. He prayit till his god Appolyne To grant him wittering quhat kin fyne Suld fall of þat weire and discord That wes betuix him and his our lord. [Than] writtin wes till him this werss In Latyne, that I sall reherss: Crescens perdit [Alin] transgressus maxima regna. The cressandis sall gret landis tyne, The watter oure passand of Alyne. This wes the sentens of this werss þare, For the king of Lydis baire Off goullis in to siluer brycht The cressantis in his armes dicht. This ansuere Cressus thocht rycht gud, For vther wayes he vnderstude; Than efterwart the gammyn ?ede, Or werd or weris proffit in deid, And said: “The landis gif I sall tyne Ar Cyrus landis, and nocht myne, That I sall with my oste oure ryde, To fell his ogart and his pryde.” His ost than sone and hastely He semblit, and syne in gret hy Our that watter he passit onone For to suppowell Babelone; Thare Cyrus lay, as ?e herd eire, Assegiand it with his powere, And thare he schewit him on a hycht His oste arrayand to the fecht, Bot quhen he saw on quhat kin wiss That vincust wes þe Babelonyss, And þe cete wonyng neire, He changeit purpose and manere, And turnyt bak and tuke the flycht. The Persantis lyngit on at rycht, Followand fast and egerly, Chasand him dispitously, Slaand his men doune heire and þare, Quhare euer at thai ourtakin were; Himself has eschapit narrowly, And sawf wan fra that iuperty. This Cressus efter this affray, As he a nycht in till his bed lay, And dremyt in his sleip that he Wes in a crop set of a tre, Quhare Iupiter with rane him wet And Phebus quhill wiþ sone him het. Him thocht in till his dremys swa That he wes stad betuix þaim twa, All þe tyme þat he thare lay, Quhill on the morne that it wes day; Than Phanua, his dochter ?ing, He callit and tald his dremyng, For scho be sciens vsit to tell Off seire thingis befor thai fell, As wychis dois or nygramanceris, Devydand thingis on thare maneris, And throu the deuill dissauit ar þai That neuer the seker suth will say. Bot throu þaim quhen at he is sa Travalit at he mon ansuere ma, The ansuere at he to þaim mayis Oft dowbill vnderstanding in it has; And sa it hapnit at men are Dissauit oft on þat manere; For thingis þat are for to be To wit is Goddis prevate; And forthy thareof þe certane Is nane can tell bot he allane. ?it neuerþeless þis damycell Tald hir fader þat efter fell, That Cyrus suld him tak in yre, And swak him in a birnand fyre, And thare he suld be brynt, but dout, Bot gif the rayne the fyre put out. Sa Cyrus with his oste onone Fra he had wonyng Babelone Passit in Lydis till assaill The king Cressus haill batall; Quhare, efter mony iuperdyis, And diuerss changeit victoryis, The king of Lydus, þis Cressus, Wes tane and brocht qwik to Cyrus, And he gert cast him in a fyre Off fagottis birnand brycht and schyre. There brynt he nocht bot tholit payne, For it laid on sa fast of rayne That he vpon na wiss mycht bryne All the tyme he lay tharein. And quhen of Perss the king Cyrus Saw how it hapnit with him þus, Out of þat fyre in hy gert he Him till his stait restorit be; And syne throu tretiss and throu chans Thai wer accordit of that distans; And quhen on this wiss king Cressus Wes fre deliuerit fra Cyrus, He tald the cass and the manere Till Phanua, his dochter deire. Thare in hert he tuke sic pryde, For he eschapit sa that tyde, That he trowit na mischans mycht fall Fra thin furþ þat him fordo sall; Bot scho at saw his hawtane chere Vpone þis wiss maid him ansuere; Scho said, þocht he with slycht þus slyde, “?our lattyr day ?it mon ?e byde, And forouth þat on na wiss ?e suld your fortoune happy pryse, For at þe evin of the faire day Men prysis it, the suth to say, And quhen þe lif of man tais end Than is it tyme him to commend.” And quhen at scho had said him thus, Scho bad him be ware at Cyrus At him suld nocht sa greiffit be, That he suld hing him on a tre, Quhare noþer rayne for mekle weit Suld saif him na ?it sone for heit; And as scho tald him sa it fell, That were oure prolixt now to tell. CHAPTER LI. Off Syrus king of Persis dede And of his ost slane in þat stede. Sone efter þat þe king Cressus Wencust wes and fordoune thus, Cirus, þe king and lord of Perss, Off quham befor I maid reherss, Past with his oste, as man of weire, Oure Araxis, that gret ryvere That oft on heid ay rynnand is Betuix Silyte and Lidys. Dame Tannys þat tyme wes lady And quene regnand of all Sythy; And quhen scho herd at þe gret oste Off Cirus come all bolne in boste, Hir counsall gaif hir to ger brek All hir briggis, and all hir furdis steik, Bot let þaim passage to haif fre With sic ane oste in hir cuntre. Scho assentit to þis counsall, But scho gert all þe briggis be haill, And let þaim oure Araxis fre Within hir land to mak entre, And in straittis neire thare by Scho gert hir sone be prevely, His awantage for to se, And byde his oportunyte Him to defend or till assaill, For vre is [wauerand] of batall. And quhen Cyrus wes cummyn in The land of Sythik for to wyn, For meit thare foreouris þai send, And pavillionis thai gert distend And all thare tentis sone in hy, Be liklynes to tak herbery, Trumpand all þe day on hycht; And quhen it neire drew to þe nycht All thare fyris þai gert bald, As þai wald still þare herbery hald. Off wyne þai drew and rostit flesche, And eit and drank thaim to refresche, And syne devodit prevely; And leit within thare tentis ly All thare wittalis sa assayit, As thai had bene fra it affrayit. The Sythikis þan þat in the hycht Had lying all þe day to nycht, Thocht till haif funding vnarrayit The Persantis haill and vnpurvait, And thocht þaim sa for to supprise Quhen thai were slepand on þis wiss, And thocht to haif þaim at thare will, And thus þare purposs to fulfill. The Sythykis come with thare batall The Persantis sodanely till assaill Within thair tentis, as thai thocht At all suld at þair will be wrocht. Off the Persantis nane þai fand Within þe tentis þan sterand; For quhy thai all remuffit were, As I ?ow tald a litill aire. Than thir Sythikis tuke herbery, And eit and drank rycht gredely; Off the wittaill thai assayit Thai tuke and eit and litill payit. Bot or the gammyn wes all gane Thay payit mare na twa for ane. Wyne and flesche þai had at will, And thare of thai tuke a huge fill, That thare wes quhene wist of his awne How mony akeris he had sawin, Bot þaim self for?et full quyt; To drink thai had sic appetite That all vnwachit sodanely Thai fell on sleip rycht hevely. Off the Persantis þan þe spyis Tald to Cyrus on quhat wiss He mycht his purpose weill fulfill, And haue the Sythikis at his will, For all þe tyme þai were þaim neire, And saw þare manere and þare powere. With þat þe Persantis hastely Come on þe Sythikis sodanely, And fand the Sythikis all lyand Within þare tentis all slepand; And þare þai stekit þaim as scheip, And slew þaim doune haill in þare sleip, That few eschapit fra þat place For to tell how it hapnyt was. The quenys sone in to that steid In thai tentis wes slane to deid, That ?oung and avenand wes and faire, And till the kinrik prince and aire Off all the landis of Sythy. Forthy þe barnage wes sary Off his dede, and neuerþeles His moder tuke vp sic stoutnes And dissymylit hir dule wes done, And arrayit hir oste but hone, And ordanit þaim in battallis seire, And spyit quhare þe Persantis were, And hir avantage kest to se How scho mycht best revengeit be. Hir oste scho scaillit heire and thare, And schupe as scho affrayit ware, And leit the Persantis with þare pryde Ryote hir landis and oure ryde; Bot scho neire persewit ay, Till at þe last apon a day Scho saw þaim in þe straittis þare Quhare all hir ostis about þaim ware; Than scho in hir enbuschement That thocht to cum till hir entent Gert trump vp tyte, and sodanely Brak on the Persantis hawtanely With all hir ostis on ilk syde. Sa vmbeset thai were þat tyde With the Sythikis that nane mycht Fra þe batall ta þe flycht, He behuffit on neid to byde Quhare thai laid on on ilk syde, And þare sa felloun wes þe fycht That mony doure to deid wes dycht, Mony hawberk and mony scheild, And mony seire funding in feild; Bot there the Sythikis douchtely Wan alhaill the victory. Twa hundreth thousand thare wes deid Off Persantis lyand in þat steid; The king Cirus of Perss þat day Wes slane in feild, amang þaim lay. The quene, þat thocht þis mekle gud, Gert fill a fat full of þare blud, That slane lay and in þe feild levid, And syne gert stryke of Cyrus hevid And in þat fat gert strike it in. “Drink now thi fill or euer þov blyn,” Quod scho, “for xxx. ?eris and mare Ay manis blude þov has thristit saire; Now has þov fundin þare þi fill, Drink or leif, quheþer euer þov will.” Efter þat Cirus slane þus wes His sone succedit Cambises; He muffit in till Egipt weire, And raid it throu with his powere; Thare all tempillis he kest doune, And fordid thare religioun, And at thare ald cyrymonyis That thai vsit apon thare wiss Thare custumis of deuocioun He had abhominacioun. Twa spamen syne put him to deid, And þai succedit in his steid, And maid þame kingis of þat land, At thare liking it sterand. His sone Daryus raiss þaim agane And has þaim baith in batall slane. CHAPTER LII. How Daryus king wes discomfite And syne ?eid to þe batall tyte. Four hundreth winter and twenty Or God wes borne of oure Lady, Consentand all þe barnage haill, Daryus tuke þe gouernaill Off all Perss in properte, And regnyt in gret ryalte. Quhen he recouerit had Assyry And Babelone alhalely Agane þe stout king Amprotyr, Off Sythy þat tyme lord and syre, He raissit oste and muffit weire, And come on him with his powere, For causs þat Amprotyr, the king Off Sythy, maid him plane warnyng Off his dochter till his wif, And for this causs begouth this strif. The oste of Perss wes namit þen Sevin hundreth thousand armyt men, That for the luf of þat lady Set þaim alhaill in iuperdy Off gret perellis and dout of deid, And oft disparit of remeid; For, as thai throu þe cuntre past, The Sythikis handillit þaim so fast, Conwoyand þaim on ilka syde, That nane durst fra the batall byd That the Sythikis mycht oureta, Than thai but ransoun wald thaim sla; And sa be sindry iuperdyis Fourty thousand reknyt twiss Darius myssit of his men, With iuperdyis at slane were þen, And him self all prevely Fled of the kinrik of Sythy, For dreid thai suld behind him streke The furdis and þe briggis brek Off Danuby, þe gret ryvere That mercheand is to Sythy neire. Off þe scaith þat he had tane He maid bot litill caire or nane, And thocht þat tinsall wes bot small For to rekin his costis all; Bot me think now þat quha suld tyne Sa mony of gud men and fyne, That he were nocht of litill mycht That had sa mony folkis to fycht Vpone a day in till a feild With wicht men wappinnis for to weild, As Daryus tynt in till Sythy Throu his hawtane succudry. Throu Asye syne he past onone Quhen he had dauntit Macedone; Wenys þat neire is be þe se With his navyne werrayit he, And þe folkis of Athenis haill Raiss to mak þaim suppowall; Forthy Darius movit weire Aganis þaim with haill powere; And thai þaim purvait for defens And maid agane þaim resistens, And with þare awne cumpany With sowdanis of Spartany, And bot xi. thousand but maire In till þe feild he semblit þare Agane vi. hunder thousand haill Off Persantis ordanit for batall; In to that fecht Melchiadess For þe Athenis chiftane wes. Thare baith thai ostis sone onone In to the feild of Marrabone Togidder assemblit hastely; Bot of þe fechting wes ferly, For quha that neire þaim by had bene, He mycht þe ta part weill haif sene In batall dourely men slaand, The toþer as bestis thare deand. Twa hundreth Persantis thare Slane in the feild funding were. Darius thus gatis discomfite Chassit fled till his schippis tyte, And with his navyne in sic affray Vnslane bot chaissit as that day Held till his land of Perss, and thare He semblit sone all his powere In þat entent for till haif bene Revengeit of his fais kene; Bot in his oste he deit throu cass, And his purposs fal?eit was. CHAPTER LIII. How Cerses with vii. hunder thousand Wes vincust baith on se and land. Four hundreth sevinty ?ere and sevin Or Mary baire the King of Hevin, His sone Cerses in his [steid], Quhen Darius, as ?e herd, wes deid, In Perss succedit king regnand, And gouernyt with his lawis þat land, And þe weire held v. ?eire That his fader in gret steire. In till his land of Persantis þen He had vii. hunder thousand men, Armyt at all poyntis clenely; Thre hunder thousand of þaim suthly Were wageouris armyt at rycht, In to thare harnes flawmand brycht; Twelf hunder schippis gret of toure, And of smallar thre thousand oure, With men and wittaill thare gert he Be stuffit weill and laid to se. His gret oste þus assemblit there Doutit gif ony watteris were Off haboundance or plente That to thame all þare drink mycht be, Or gif ony erd large wes To thare batallis for to pass, Or to thare navyne ony se Mycht rovme enewgh or large be. Sic ane oste, ?e may weill trow, Is weire for to be gaderit now Than it wes þan for to suppriss Be batall or be iuperdyiss. Off Spartany Leoniedes King and lord all þat tyme wes; He with viii. thousand men þat quhile Lay in the stratest of Teronapill. Quhen Cerses þare of had wittering, In to dispyte and pure hething That sa few for thare defens Durst mak agane him resistens, He gert array his gret batall In purpose thame for till assaill; Bot thai sped þaim befor onone In to the feild of Marratone, That in his fader tyme had bene The causs of this mischeif bedene, Forthy to assal?e his innemyis With batall or with iuperdyis. And thai rycht sa, schortly to tell As in þat fecht þe fortoune fell, The begynning thai were haill, And of þat fecht the first tinsall; And quhen this gret oste with Cerses Wnto the batall cummyn wes, Thai vmbeset on ilka syde The Spartanyis with Leonyde. The fecht raisss sone baith fersss and fell, And the batall rycht cruell, Quhare nane mycht heire bot dusche for dusche, And rappis rude with mony rusche; Mony scheild and mony speire To fruschit and to brokin were; Of on basnettis burnyst all brycht Men mycht se seire wappinnis lycht, And stedis strayand throu þe meid With woundis wyde at fast can bleid. In sic a thrang, withoutin dout, The fechting thre dais lestit out, But trewis taking or department, Or ony maner of amesing, That nane of bak the flycht mycht ta, Na nane mycht pass to purchess ma. Thai were in to that fycht sa thik That nane had rovme oþer to stik, And sa fortyrit in that thraw That nane had mycht his aynd to draw. Off slane bodyis funding ware thare Heipis hie vpstandand were, That quha sa had þaim þat tyme sene Wald nocht haif trowit bot thai had sene Twa batallis of seire nationis, As hapnis betuene regionis, Bot of alkyne natioun, As pestilens or deid felloune. The ferd day quhen Leoniedes Saw how he with his fais set was He callit till him his wageouris, His freyndis and his sowdeouris; Out of the press of the batall He thrang and said: “I gif counsall That ?e remufe out of the fycht, And draw ?ow to ?one hill on hycht, ?ow to refresche and tak þe aire; And quhen it nedis syne to repaire Fra that ?e refreschit be, For better ?it I think to se; For I will with the Spartanyis Pruf sum vther iuperdyis, Supposs I happin to be slane And for to de in to þe payne; For quhy it is my honest det For my land my lif to set, And set nocht by my lif a fle Quhill I haif gottin my land all fre, Na I compt nocht na hurt a peire My honour and my land to weire. Forthy to ?ow, my feris all, I gif to counsall quhat euer fall That we na langer hover heire, Bot to ?one gret ost lat ws steire, And set ?our lif in iupertye For to distroy oure innemy, Na comptis nocht þe dayis lycht, Na ?it till ?our fais be dycht, Bot on the nycht gif we may se That ony hap may ouris be, Within thare tentis quhare thai ly Cum we on þaim sodanely; For sa slepand best we may Put þaim to sa hard assay That, for out perell, ma sall de Than sall be bovne to fecht or fle, And our worschip na may nocht be Commendit of mare honeste Than to be funding togidder all, How sa euer þe fortoune fall, Ouþer with fais within thare tentis Or in plane feild or in buschementis; For honour artis ws till assaill, And aventure may oft availl, And prowes puttis till perill, And efter hope happinnis quhile; And þus be fell opunyons Foroutin excusations We salbe savit fra all blame, And kepit salbe our gud fame.” To þis þai assentit all, And did his counsall, gret and small, And gert thare spyis ta gud keip Quhill þat þe Persantis wer on sleip Within thare tentis quhare thai lay. And þan, schortly for to say, Leoniedes with his cumpany Come on þe Persantis sodanely Quhen þai were sadly falling on sleip, And stekit þame as þai were sheip, That sum with woundis walknyt were, And sum were gaspand, granand saire, And sum sa stekit stakerand stude, And sum lay bluberand in þare blude; And þus in woundis as thai wauerit And stekit sa with stokis stauerit, The Persantis ilkane stekit were, Sparand noþer freynd nor broþer, For þai were of sic multitud And sa thik togidder stude That nane mycht myss quhare he wald mynt, Na nane to deid gaif double dynt, And mony smorit and lossit the lif Foroutin straik of suerd or knyf. And þus þe Spartanys but chas Wencust þare fais neire in that place, For fra þe glomyne of the nycht Till on þe morne þat day wes lycht, And till ane houre efter þe none Or þat the fecht wes fully done. Quhen þat þe king wes socht And funding in þe feild wes nocht, Sex hundreth thousand Persantis þare In to þe deid funding ware, And slane in to that iuperdy, With sex hundreth anerly Off Spartanyis þat in þat tyde To batall come with Leoniyde, That slane with him in batall wes; And þus discomfit wes Cerses, And, as of neid than him behuffit, Till his schippis he him remuffit, And with his navyne þan thocht he That all Grece suld distroyit be. In till þis tyme Tymostocles Off Athenis that chiftane wes, That is in Grece a gret cete And mast famouss in that cuntre; Quhen he þe Yonis saw alhaill In till Cerses suppowall, And had his flote in gouernyng, And for thir causs of Perss þe king Daryus, the fader of Cerses, Agane Athenis commuffit wes, And sa were þai þe causs principall Off all þis weire and þis batall; For halely the Athenyens With Yonyis in thare defens Agane Daryus raiss of weire, Quhairfor he raisit his powere Aganis the Atheniens, That maid sa manly resistens Quhill in the Marracone on a day Slane twa hundere thousand lay; And, as I said, þis Tymosteles, That saw how all þis cummyn wes, Set all his slycht and his quayntiss For to trete with þe Yonyiss; And for him worthit to forbeire, As vse is among men of weire, Entercomonyng; forthy be bill He wrait his entent and will [To] the amerwaill of Yonyss, And þus he wrait on preve wyss; He said: “Me think ?e ar to blame, That ar to rekles of ?our fame, Set ?e think be ?our consciens That for ?our stait ?e mak defens, Bot ?it it is gret cruelte Off ?our gud fame rekles to be; For honour tholis confusioun [Quhen] revery regnys but resoune, And wit with will quha will suppriss, Thare honeste defoullit lyiss. Off kyndnes tharefor haiffis nov thocht, And thinks for ?ow quhat ?e haif wrocht In Marracone apon a day, Quhare slane ii? thousand lay, And how oure frendis of Spartany For ?our causs alhalely In till oure suppowall raiss, And how thare king Leoniydass Now in to þis latter fecht Sex hundreth thousand on a nycht With sex hundreth men [has] slane; And in þat batall with gret pane Leoniydes slane wes thare, That we and þai mycht rew full saire. For he wes worthy, wyss and wycht, And of his handis a hardy knycht. And now þe king of Perss, Cerses, That fra þat fecht eschapit is, In ?one gret flote apon þe se Full effrayit has tane entre, And schapit to distroy ws all. Be God, perchans his pryde may fall; For quhy ?e quyt ws now kyndnes, That quhen ?e se ws set in press, Gif out of havin ?our schippis be, ?e change to luf and turne to se, And lat ws with our fais fycht Till þat our goddis deill þe rycht.” This wes his counsall and his will, That he gert writt and closs in bill, And till a stane at wes neire by, Quhare þat he wist rycht witterly That Yonyse wald aryve, He gert it festnyt be belive. The awmerall sone land has tane, And saw this apon the stane; Fra he it red he wist it wes The counsall of Thomesteles. In haist his erandis þan did he, And sped him syne fast to þe se, And drew him fra þe Cerses sone of Perss, Rycht as Themestocles did reherse. Themestocles ?it still abaid And of thare schippis wonyng [had]; And lay arrayit with his oste, Ay redy for to keip þe coste. Bot Antynodor, þat lady That quene wes þan of Carnasy, In þe suppleying of Cerses Brak on this Themestocles Out of hir buschement quhare scho lay, And maid rycht stout and hard assay, And pruffit worschip and manheid Amang þe cheif of his knychtheid. Thare womanis will turnyt in man And manheid turnyt in woman; For þare scho raissit sa fell a fycht That mony a doure to deid wes dycht; Bot ?it the victory neuerþeles Behuffit to Themystocles, For thare wes slane þat stout lady And neire alhaill hir chevalry, That hapnit haill that Cerses king Suld haue lawd in þare helping With all þe folkis of his navyne; Bot throu þe counsall of cowyne And wit of this Themestocles All vthere wayis thare fortoune wes; For all Yonys full rycht, Quhen thai the forse saw of the fycht, Turnyt to luf and held to se. Than Cresses in perplexite Wes hard set in his navyne, And come nocht till all esy fyne; For as he houerit þire wawis wod Drownyt seill of his folkis in flude, And seill eschapit for radnes For þat þare king wes in sic press, And seill of þaim were tane of weire With þe Athenis and thare powere. And þan of Perss Mardonyus, At saw his king reboittit þus, Said till him: “Schir I reid at ?e Set ?ow for ?our liffis saufte; For heire ?e thole sa oure gret schame That I dreid were to fynd at hame, And or it sa suld happin þare In to ?our land I wald ?e ware, Leiffand all ?our oste with me; And sa, how euer oure fortoune be, To hald of weire oure innemyis, That wald ?ow and ws all suppriss; Sa sall excusit be oure name, And ?e sauf be fra defame.” To this counsall of Mardyone Cerses assentit sone onone, And deliuerit him all his men And maid him oure þaim all chiftane; And þare þat king, at first gert big With schippis oure þe flud a brig, With few folkis of his cumpany Away þan lorkit prevely In till a litill fischare skovt, For press þat he wes in and dout, And winter wedder fell and grete Lowssit all his brig of thret; And of the seruice of a man Off neid held him payit þan, Quhare forowth at he gert the see For his navyne lovrand be. For falt of rovme his mekle mycht Kest doune hillis hie on hycht, And with þe plane erd evin þaim maid To schaw his oste quhare at thai raid; To skant all rynnand reveris were For to be drink till his powere. Alkyne hap him wantit thare, And vnfortoune maid him misfaire, And all his futmen and archearis, That were betaucht to þare ledaris, For dreid and hungere and travale Maid þaim all fayntly to faill, And bolne till at the last the dede Consomyt þaim forout remeid. Oure all the landis quhare þai lay Mycht na man neire þaim pass the way, For thare carioun and the stynk Thai nere to brist at thai wald think; Foullis wild and bestis fell, That of þare carioun feld þe smell, That fey oste followit all way neire, Quhill thai deand falling were, And of thare flesche wald fill þaim þare Or thai fullely all deid ware. Quhen Cerses þus to Maridone gaif Off his oste alhaill þe laif Thare remanit þan vnslane, Mardyone wox thareof sa fayne That he him put to press sa fast Quhill he defoullit wes at the last. Fra þin his way to Grece he past And werrayit thare wichtly and fast; Off Grekis mony he discomfyt And wan þe castell of Alywet, And the Athenis besely He tretit with his trechery, And led þaim in hope of pess Quhill þat he saw thare fredome wes Off sic mycht and sic pouste Off weire thai mycht nocht wonnyng be. Off thare cete þan in ire A gret part thai brynt in fyre. In Boesy with his powere He past syne thare to mak weire; Off Grekis ane hundreth thousand haill, All arrayit for batall, Forsely followit þis Mardione And gaif him batall sone onone, And with him facht in feild sa fast Till he wes vincust at þe last, And all his oste thare neire wes slane, And him self with mekle payne Eschapit out of þat melle, Vnarmyt with a few men?e, In swat all drawkit as thai ware, Like a schip brokin marynere. His pavil?eonis and his tentis at wes Stuffit weill with gret riches Off King Cerses tresoure haill And lordis at deid ware in batall, At lest gold and iowellis plente, And als of mony riche cite, That King Cerses befor þat wan Fra þat he first weire began Till þat day he fled for dout, As ?e herd, in a fischearis skout. All þat Mardioun lost þat day, That gouernyt him but vertu ay; And þat day þat Mardonyus In Boesy wes vencust þus, A gret part of the oste of Perss In Asye, as I herd reherss, Wes discomfyt and put to se And set in herd perplexite. Efter þis quhen the king Cerses Hame till his awne land cummyn wes, Sa ill commendit thare wes he And lakit with his awne men?e That schortly thare, the suth to say, [In his] awne hall apon a day Burdis and clathis þare on set, And he had weschin to ga to mete, His stewart maid on him a schot And claucht him kenely by the throt, And with a knyf up to the heft [He] stekit him quhill the lif he left. This wes the ending of Cerses, That in all tyme vnhappy wes. As Orosyus, þat clerk sa fyne, Wrait till his maister sanct Augustyne, Wnder thir the kingis of Perss, The quhilkis ?e herd me last reherss, A hundreth thousand nynty syss Reknyt were of deid bodyis, All of Persantis slane doune, And of nane vthere natioun. Quhen þat Cerses endit þus His sone succedit Daryus, The quhilk in Alexanderis dais Endit, as the story sais. Now of my purposs to mak end Off Perss þe storyis I haue spend. CHAPTER LIV. How lang þe Scotis were in Scotland Befor the Pightis thare in wonnand. Four hundreth winter and fifty And twa to rekin oure evinly Befor þe blessed Natiuite, Out of Athenis the cete To Rome þe lawis brocht were þan, Writtin in to table stane. The Romanis ?it efter thai To þaim ekit tablis twa, As in thare storyis writtin is. And þan in Scotland þe Scotis Begouth to regne and for to steire Twa hundreth full and forty ?eire Five winteris to and monethis thre, Gif that all suld reknyt be, Or the Pightis in Scotland Come, and in it were wonnand.

CHAPTER LVI. Off a felloune mortalite That fell wiþin Romys cete. Thre hundreth ?ere foure scor and sevin Befor at borne wes þe King of Hevin, In to þe steid of consules In Rome Tribuny chosin wes. The Romanis wan þan a cete That than wes callit Penestre, And viii. citeis þan of weire To Rome wes maid tributere. Gret pestilens in to thai dais In Rome fell, as Frere Martyne sais; Within the myddis of the tovne All þe erd þan opnit doune, Sa vgsum, hidwise and sa fell That throu þat ryft men mycht se hell, And of þe stynk come of þat steid Mony within the tovne wes deid. Than in the cete wes a man That callit be name wes Martyne than; He till his goddis maid prayere To gif him wit on what manere And how that exaltatioun Thai maid sa gret affectioun Mycht maist hastely closit be, And how to succour þat cete Maist redy help wes or defens For that felloune pestilens. His god him ansuerd at the last, And bad him ga and arme him fast, And at that ryft in haist leip doune, Gif þat he thocht to sauf þe tovne; And at his ansuere he ?eid sone And hastely as he bad has done, And fra he doune fell in þat gap All þe ryft togidder craip, And sa wes savit the cete Fra stynk and fra mortalite. This Brynnyus ?it all tyme þen Werrayit, with the Franche men, The Romanis in thai samyn dais, And thare of, as Frere Martyne sais, A Roman saw a Franche man Haiffand about his hals þan Off gold all thrawin like a lase; This Romane maid þan sic purchase That anerly baith he and he Togidder suld in lytis be, And on na wyss thai suld þaim twyne Till the tane mycht the tother wyn, Slane or ?oldin in batall, Withoutin ony suppowell Off ony, and as it fell þan The Romane slew the Franche man, And fra his hals in to that place He tyt away the goldin laiss, And put about his awne hals; Fra thine he and his lynnage als In thai landis callit were The lasit Romanis mony ?ere. CHAPTER LVII. Off Alexandre the conquerour, How he raiss to stait and honour. Thre hundreth xxvi. ?ere Befor the byrth of our Lord deire, Alexander, Phillippis sone, King of Grece and Macedone, And gottin of Olympias, His moder, at wes faire of face, The awmeralis dochter of Cartage Scho wes, and cummyn of þat lynnage, This Alexander the conquerour, That wes worthy of valour, Be heretable successioun Begouth to regne in Macedone, And bot ?eris xii. of eild Quhen he begouth wappinnis to weild, And regnyt thare to bot xii. ?ere, Quhen all þe Orient he wan neire, And syne haly set his entent Till haue wonnyng the Occident, But thare of fal?eit he throu cass, For he in Babulone poisound was. Off his douchty deidis seire In diuerss bukis writtin heire, And there in this tretise I Will nocht thare with me occupy. The Romanis fra þin grew of mycht, And woxe in weris stout and wycht; The Sampnytis, þat þan in [mydway] Betuix Poll and Champane lay, And in to sic haboundans wes Off siluer, gold and of riches That all þe armouris þat þai had Wes of gold of siluer maid, Thir Sampnytis þan raiss alhaill Agane þe Romanis in batall; Bot þe Sampnytis sone and tyte Were with þe Romanis discomfit, And efter þat with þare powere The Romanis ?it discomfit were; Bot ?it þe Romanis at þe last With þe Sampnytis faucht sa fast That xx. thousand on a day Slane and in þe feild þan lay, And þe Sampnytis and þare king Wes takin thare in þat fechting. Thare chemyss and þare cheif tovne Than to þe erd wes castin dovne. Thare wes na fa of feid sa fell Aganis Rome, na sa cruell, As wes the Sampnytis in thare dais, As Oross and Frere Martyne sais, And þe causs wes principall Off þat weire and þat batall That for Champane all þe land In all proffittis is haboundand, And esely set to þe se, With havinnis gud in gret plente, Sa þat alkin merchandice Come till it apon all wiss. That cheif cete of gret fame Capua wes callit be name, That to Cartage or Rome þan wes Praisit in all liklynes. Thai landis the Romanis thocht To thare awne vse till haif brocht; Here for first raiss all þe weire, And endit as ?e herd langere. CHAPTER LVIII. How the Carentynis faucht Agane þe Romanis wiþ gret maucht. Thre hundreth ?ere and thriss thre Befor þe blessit Natiuite, The Karentynis with þare powere Aganis the Romanis raiss of weire; The messingere dispitously Thai defoullit and schamefully, And warnyst þaim rycht weill without With all þare merchis þaim about, And send for Pirrus oure þe se, For king of Grece þat tyme wes he. And he brocht with him of fut men Four score of thousands comptit þen, And vii. thousand men on horss, Faire of fassone and of corss, And olifantis full twenty, Quhare neuer nane in Ytay Wes kend nor sene befor that day. In batall son, þe suth to say, Thai mellit þare and faucht rycht fast; Bot the Karentynis at the last Were discomfit in that steid With all þare oste, and Pirrus fled With mekle schame attoure þe se, Intill his land with his men?e; And þan þe Carentynis haill Socht þame of Cartage of suppowall, That wes the cheif tovne of Affrik, A faire cete, nane till it lyke, And wes als befor Rome, but weire, Biggit twa hundreth and sevinty ?ere. Sa thocht þai to defend with mycht Fra þame of Rome for all thare slicht Tessally and vthire ylis seire, That in þe Grekis [se] is lyand neire. CHAPTER LIX. How the Romanis were discomfite Wiþ þaim of Cartage and Affrik. Twa hundreth winter and sexty And nyne to rekin fullely, Hannaball þe eldar ?ude With a rycht gret multitud Off weill arrayit and armyt men Off olifantis tald thriss ten; Be schip with þai he tuke þe se In Sy?ill [swa] aryvit he. The Romanis sone gaderit ware, And with him faucht in battall thare, And handillit him in fecht sa fast That thai him vencust at the last. His olifantis thai thriss ten Thai tuke, and slew vp all the men, And all thare navyne thare tuke thai, And scantly wan him self away; And þan of þe consules, That Achalyus callit wes, Tuke with him a gret multitud Off men of armes, wicht and gud, And passit with þat oste þe se. In Cartage sone aryvit he, And foure and sevinty citeis seire, And all at in þaim wonnand were, Throu all Affrik as he raid, All subiect to Romanis he maid; And throu þe land as he raid sa Towart the ryvere of Bawgada, Off sex score of fut he fand Ane eddere on þe erd crepand, That mony of his men to deid Has slane and wellyit in that steid. Than with the edder sa he wrocht That to the deid sone he hir brocht, And þe skyne he gert fra hir tyt And to Rome syne send he it. And thai of Cartage in þat quhile Wald haif tretit with þis Atyll, Bot he refusit it vtraly, For causs that he thocht halely For till haue wonnyng þaim of weire, Thocht thai had bene in þe contrere. Than thai of Cartage with counsall The Affricanis tuke to þaim haill, And faucht with Aytill and his oste, And vencust him for all his boste; And þus with þaim of Affrik quyte The Romanis wes discomfyte, And Aytill Regall thare chiftane Wes ?oldin and as presoner tane, And send to Cartage in presoune Foroutin lipnyng of ransoune. In Rome þan Schir Emylyus And his fallow Schir Siluyus, That of that cete twa consules, Fra þai herd how þis hapnit wes, Thre hundreth schippis thai gert be Stuffit and laid to þe se, In Affrik till aryve onone, To wenge the scaith at þai had done. The Affricanys sone in hy Recounterit þaim dispitously With thre hundreth schippis agane; There were þe Romanis haill doune slane, And all þare navyne takin quyte, And all þare gret ost discomfit. CHAPTER LX. How þe Franche men in batall Were vincust wiþ þe Romanis haill. Twa hundreth and foure score of ?ere Befor the byrth of our Lord deire, A fell subuersioun and suddane The toune of Rome had neire ouretane; For of Tybere þe gret ryvere Sa reith of spait with watteris seire Raiss on hicht in to the tovne, Briggis and bigging it kest doune Sa quycly þat þan men wald weyne That neuer bigging thare had bene. The Franche men in to þat tyde Maid þaim of new þan for to ryde Aganis the Romanis, bot thai Recounterit þaim in gud array, And þare þe Franche men qwyte Were with the Romanis discomfyt. CHAPTER LXI. How Hannaball throu aventure Wincust of Rome alhale þe floure. Twa hundreth winter and nynetene Or lichtare wes þe Madyn schene, Hannaball with his empyre, Off Affrik þan baith lord and syre, Passit in to Spayne, and þare a tovne Famouss and of gret renovne, Dagout be name, assegit he, And straitly gert it kepit be Fra all proffittis and wittale, Quhill thai within begouth to faill Throu defalt and hunger saire, And sa of neid thai ?oldin were And deliuerit wes the tovne, And he till erd gert cast it doune, For causs in auld tyme that it To Rome wes in frendschip knyt. The Romanis þan of þare entent To Hannaball gret message sent, Bot on na kyne wiss wald he The messingeris with eyne se, Na ?it nane of thare message heire, Na speir quhare with thai chargeit were. In Rome that tyme Publyus Scypro and Sympronyus Chosin were thre consules, And gouernand þare office wes Quhen Hannaball with his powere Come with his ost in gret effere, Out of the montis of Peremy The nerrest way to Ytaly. With gret travale as he past In Ytaly ?it at þe last He come þidder with gret payne, And with his oste þare tuke þe plane. He wes fully reknyt þen Ane hundreth thousand of futmen, And xx. thousand men or horss, Faire of fassone and of corss. Scipro, at þat tyme was Ane chosin of the consules, In to þe plane faucht with him thare, And woundit Hannaball rycht saire. For to reherse ?ow now schortly, The Romanis were alhalely There with the Affricanis quyt In to that batall discomfit; And efter quhen Sympronyus Had herd how þat it hapnit þus Till his fallow Scipione, With his oste he come onone, And fifty of his feris all Faucht fast with this Hannaball; Bot ?it the Romanis neuerþeles In þat batall discomfit wes, Sa Scipio wes wonder fayne That he wan fra þe fycht vnslane, All him alane foroutin ma. As he þan saw þe fortoune ga, Quhen all the victory wes done, This Hannaball with his oste sone Past in Tuskane with gret faire Within the first moneth of waire, And held furth with his batallis syne Towart the monthis of Appennyne, Quhare þan sa thik þe snaw fell, With hailstanes rycht sharp and snell, That all his oliphantis thare, Horss and catall perist ware. This Hannaball ?it neuerþeles Wist weill þat Schir Flawme wes Left in þe tentis him allane, Quhare all þe Romanis wer ourtane; Than hastely he turnyt agane, Him till haif tane or þan haif slane, Bot Flawme with his cumpany Recounterit him rycht manfully; Bot ?it with gile þis Hannaball Him and his þare discomfit all, Sa þat of þe Romanis haill Deid and slane in that batall Were xxv. thousand neire, And sex thousand als takin were. CHAPTER LXII. How Hannaball agane in fecht Vencust of Rome alhale the mycht. [Twa] hundreth ?eris xi. and ane Or God of Mary flesche had tane, In Rome that tyme Luculyus Paule, and alsua Publyus Carrentyne and Werro was In to þe toune maid consules; In till a cete callit Canos, Within Poille, on set purposs The Romanis send þaim for to fecht With Hannaball and his gret mycht. Off Romanis in that batall þare Foure and fifty thousand were Reknyt and slane vpone þat greyne; Befor þat day wes neuer sene That þai of Rome with sic dispyte Wes sa haly discomfit, For þare wes þan Emylyus, And his fallow callit Paulus, That for the gretest that tyme wes Chosin to be consules, And of the pretor xx. men, Grettest of all þe consules þen, And of the senatouris xxx. thare Slane in that fecht and takin ware. Off gentill knychtis þan on fute, That vsit nouþer spur na bute, Thre hundreth deid in þat batall, And xl. thousand vther haill Off knychtis armyt apon horss, Faire of fassoune and of corss, Slane in to þat iurnee was. Than ane of þe consules, That be name wes Werro cald, As in his buke Frere Martyne tald, All prevely out of þat rout With xv. men on horss for dout Off his lif to Wenys fled, For to be tane or slane þai dred. To the Romanis þan but weyne This the lattast day had bene, Gif Hannaball in till all hy, Quhen done wes all the victory, Haill past one straucht with his men?e For till haif tane vp the cete. In takenyng of þat victory, Quhen endit wes þe iuperdy, Off gold ryngis, faire and brycht, Tane of thare fyngeris slane in fecht, Thre maiss, þat wes thre bollis met, This Hannaball withoutin let To Cartage gert in hy be send Quhen at this iurnay had tane end. Than wes the Romanis alsa wa, And for this causs disparit thai sua, That thai maid þaim all haly bovne For till haue fled and left the tovne, Had nocht bene Scipio Affricane, That of the knychtis wes chiftane, With drawin þat held þaim in, And thocht avantage for to wyne. Off counsall þan, but langere baid, Off þe bondis þat thai had Bocht befor bot of licht price Within the tovne to mak seruice, He maid knychtis in þat neid, And þaim arrayit in riche weid; And armouris, þat vp offerit were To goddis in thare tempillis there, Thai tuke in þat necessite, And thai gert þaim armyt be, All thai bondis euerilk ane; And þat ensample haif thai tane Be counsall of ane Siluyus, That tald þaim how þat Romulus Off theiffis and murtheraris knychtis maid, That he in till his presoun had; All thai mysdoaris he leit ga And gert þaim wappinnis and armis ta, And maid þaim fre till he had haill Sex thousand wicht men to batall. The Romanis be this ensample sone The like manere there has done; Sa Rome, befor disparit, than Respirit in hope of thir men. Bot ?it, as this Orosyus In till his cornikillis tellis ws, Quha in to Rome befor had bene, And had of it the worschip sene, He suld haif waxin reid for schame, Fra he had sene thare ryall fame, Thare honour and þare ryalte, Sa changeit in deformyte; For all thare gouernall þan had Barnys and fulis of ?outhhed, Bondis or thrallis, cripillis or carll, That vsit forouth to beire or harll Sic thing as men wald þaim charge; Bot to beire armour, scheild or targe, Thai were nocht thare to sufficiand, Na till assaill bot to stand, And behuffit in to sic seruice, Informyt and taucht as were nowiss; And thus in steid of senatouris Carllis and bondis worthit counsalouris. CHAPTER LXIII. How Hannaball wes wincust sone Efter with þe bondis of Rome. Twa hundreth ?eris and twiss thre Befor Cristis Natiuite, Hannaball, with mekle boste, Off Chawmpane gaderit all his oste, And thre mylis vtouth the tovne he baid. Forthi the Romanis murnyng maid, And all the senatouris ilkane Sa with raddour were ourtane, And out of hope disparit quyte That thai but press were discomfite; Na were the wiffis at thare wes That on wallis with besynes, Berand stanis heire and thare, Quhare þaim thocht mast neid ware, It to defend in to that weire, Efter as thai saw mystere. And Hannaball with his oste syne Come till the ?et callit Port Latyne, And thare the counsall callit Falus Saw þat he wes cummyng þus, Gaderit all the Romanis haill For till haue gevin þaim thare batall; And as thai suld haif samyn met Togidder forouth þat ilk ?et, Sa gret tempest and hailstanis wycht Fell thare with sic forse and pyth That baith þe ostis sped þaim thare, Till thai within thare tentis ware, And baid þare till þe tempest left; And thocht for till haif semblit eft Wpone þe morne, and thai had sone The wethere worthing brycht and schone; Bot haill and tempest woxe þan ware And growysar about be fare Than it wes apon þe first day, And with mare dout þan withdrew thai. And þan Hannaball be þat weill thocht That he be man wes lettyne nocht To waist and vndo þe cete, Bot throu þe mycht of Goddis powste. Fra Rome þan he remuffit haill His oste, but maire baid or batall, Bot ?it throu pouerall of þat tovne He wes put syne to confusioun, For all his pryde and all his mycht, As the cornikillis tharof tellis rycht. Scipio þat tyme Affricane Had sevin and sevinty winter gane Off his eild, and ?it þan he Wes prisit man of gret pouste; He passit in to Spayne of weire, Cartage wes þan of his powere That he had wonnyng, and tresour That thai had gaderit lang befor, As siluer and gold, and þare for he Payit till his knychtis large fe; And thare he tuke Macgovne þe stout, Broþer till Hanniball but dout, And to the Romanis him send he In presone for till haldin be. Quhen Scipio apon this wiss Had done in Spayne gret victoryse, In till Affrik syne he past, And fell in fechting þare sa fast That of his aduersaris in to that sted Fourty thousand wes slane and deid. He throu the land in ryot raid An in till it his mastry maid, That nane fra him þaim mycht defend. Than thai of Cartage gert sone send Till Hannaball, and bad him speid Him hame and help þaim in þat neid; For he in Ytaly wes werrayand That samyn tyme with stalwart hand. One greting þan fell Hanniball, For him behuffit leif Ytaly all; And all the knychtis at thare was Off Ytaly, and wald nocht pass With him in Affrik, but remeid He slew and gert be put to deid; Syne to Cartage in hy he come, And þare quhen he saw Scipione To trete for pese he set his thocht; Bot sa it fell thai cordit nocht, And sa behuffit þaim o neid To fecht and þaim to batall speid, And efter lang fechting thare Thai of Cartage vencust ware, And Hanniball bot with foure men, But ma, on horss eschapit þen, And fra that batall gat away; His lif sa savit he that day. Thus Scipione had the victory, And with his oste syne halely [Wan] of Cartage the cete, And maid as his awne fre. CHAPTER LXIV. How Hannaball wes vincust agane Ane oþer tyme and put to pane. Twa hundreth winter and sex oure Or Mary baire oure Saluiour, The secund batall of Affrik þan Wes done þus and tint mony man, And hastely efter that sone The weire begouth of Macedone, Quhen that Flawme, þat þan was Ane chosin of the consules, Efter mony iuperdyis And diuerss wonnyng wictoryiss, He grantit pese and trew onone To Phillip king of Macedone, That, efter Alexander wes deid, Succedit king in till his steid, Ane hundreth winter and twenty. The presoneris þan halely And captwise of the Romanis, all Tane befor with Hannaball, Recouerit were with Scipioun, And followit all his charis onone, And gert schaif of thare heid þe haire, In takin þat þai deliuerit ware Fra seruitute and bondage fre, And past all hame in thare cuntre. Efter þat it hapnit þus, The king of Asy Anthiochus Aganis þe Romanis raiss of weire, And come be se with his powere In till Affrik of Asy, And Hannaball þan prevely Drew till him agane þan Scipione In till confederatioun, Sa that his awmerall wes he Till all his navyne on þe se. Scipioun þan Affricane The Romanis with him hes he tane, And faucht with Hanniball sa fast That thai him vincust at the last, And maid on him a felloune chass; And he that for deid dredand was All his pigh put to the speid, As he wes hasterit in þat neid, And gat him throu speid of horss away, And fled furþ till oure drif his day, And quhen the king Antiochus Saw how his werd wes hapnit thus He treittit apon trewis onone, And concord maid with Scipioun. Off Rome thare wes batallis seire That, and thai all were reknyt heire, I dreid suld dull ?our appetite, And gendyr leith mare þan delite. CHAPTER LXV. How the Pightis come in Scotland First to be þarein wonnand. Twa hundreth winter and na mare Or madin Mary Ihesu baire, It hapnit in a cumpany Out of þe kinrik of Sythy Come of Pightis in Irland, Quhare þan þe Scottis wer wonnand, And wald haue bene personaly In to that land wonnand þaim by.

Thir Pightis [askit] thir Scottis then To be weddit with thare wemen, Sen nakyne women of thare kynd Thai brocht with þaim na of the strynd, Swa wiþ þaim till allyit be, Thai and thare posterite. Than þai accordit on þis wiss, Gif ony oure leiffit suld ryss And suld succeid and regne as king, Quhen þe kingis maid ending, He suld be king of þe haill, That cumyn were be lyne femall, And of the male suld nane succeid Bot it were cleire, bot ony dreid, That of the femall thare were na man Left to succeid; to þis fredome þan, And dignite prerogative, Foroutin ganecalling or strive The Scottis fra þe Pichtis wan. Pichtis þai were callit þan, For thai were men of gret stature, Forthy of pigh and of valour, And forthy Pightis callit were thai, Payntit men þat is to say. The Irischery and the folkis of the Ylis Sum sais thai come of þaim sum quhilis, For thai ar huge men as the Pightis, Stalwart and strang of strenth and mychtis. This fredome kepit wes alwayis Amangis the Pightis in thare dayis. Furth thai past þat land to wyne To þaim and þaris and all thare kyne, And the north landis occupyit. By thame wes Scottis in that tyde Regnand, and þe first man Off þai wes Fergus Ersch sone þan, And in the south ?it, as we reid, Wes Brytonis þan of Brutis seid. Fra Fergus Erth sone be lyne Tyll þat Kenede Makcalpyne Raiss as king and wes regnand Within the kinrik of Scotland, Few personis lynealye, Sum vther few collateralye, As courss maid and qualite Airis waverand for to be, Sum hapnit to regne throu malice, As ilkane vthere wald supprise; Bot fra þis Fergus evin be lyne Kenede discendit Makcalpyne, And, as we fynd in our story, Cruthnow þat tyme Makarii Wes þe first in to Scotland Attour the Pightis king regnand.

Neist him till succeid Geid, And wes maid king in till his steid, Our the Pightis in Scotland A hundreth and v. ?ere regnand. CHAPTER LXVI. Off the first distructioun Off Cartage þe noble tovne. A hundreth and fifty ?eris beforne Or God wes of our Lady borne, Off Rome gaderit þan senage And ordanit to vndo Cartage. Scipio than Affricane Lord of Romanis and chiftane, Gert in hy before him call The cete?enis of Cartage all, And gaif straitly commandment Foroutin ony impedyment Hastely furth till him bring All þare wappinnis and þare armyng, And all þare navyne syne bad he Suld till him deliuerit be; And efter þat he bad þaim mare Fra þe se at thai suld faire Ten thousand paiss haill weill met.

On that wise thai reullit weill All thare defalt of irne and steill. Scipio than in till his ire Gert set thare cete all in fyre, And it in fyre þus gatis birnand Sevintene dais wes ay lestand. This wes the first distructioun Off Cartage, that noble tovne, Quhen sevin hundreth ?eris and ane Fra it wes foundit till it wes gane.

Efter that all that tovne in fyre Wes brynt, and fallin in colis schyre, All that metall meltyn þan In till a querne togidder ran; The metall, maid sa pure and fyne, Off Corinthe had the titill syne, The name þare efter of Corinthe had, And all þe weschall of it maid. In to þis tyme I spak beforne In till Rome a barne wes borne That had foure handis and foure fete, Foure ene, foure eris, and thare to ?ete It had befor pyntillis twa. The fyre þat ilk tyme of Ethna, That is a hill within Sy?ill, Bruschit out in that samyn quhill, Sa that it brynt all sodanely Sere lands at lay it by. Alsua that ilk tyme in Sy?ill Thare raiss a sodane weire cyvill, That breyit the Romanis als weill As þaim of Sy?ill ilk deill. Bot of thai schortly for to say, Fourty thousand on a day Discomfit wer and slane doune, And þare pryde brocht to confusioun. Ay seruandis quhen ?e se ryss In ire þare lord for to suppriss, Quhare the vse is soleynare It happinnis all þe cruellare. For þi till Alexander þe king Arestotill in his teching Said: “Gif þov thinkis to be King to rigne in ryalte, Be wit of lordis þov sall lif, And þe fra lust to vertu gif. Twa toungit seruandis on all wiss And wickit and fals þov sall despiss, And thai þat of kynd ar fre, Trew seruandis in pouerte, Press nocht to put þame to gret hycht, Na to na hie rysing of mycht, For dout apon sic wiss As hawtane heris þai will ryss, And wavere mare with mawis wod Than will a stilly stand flude, To ryse agane þare lord of weire, Him to suppriss with thare powere. Fra þai be growin to welth and weill, And till vnkyndly slepand seill, To mastry gret or mekle mycht, Till honour and excedand lycht, Fra routh thai sall thare eris dyt, And na thing will of merit wit, Bot sa withdraw with pete, Mare fell þan ony ask we se.

For the suth gif we sall say, Welth and riches wount wes ay In wantones mare will to draw Than faire haiffing in mesour aw; And certis quha that haboundis, But riches, in to gud thewis, Lawte, wit and faire having, He may nocht faill of outwart thing, For thai he may weill set befor Siluer, gold or ?it tresoure, And he may sympilly with þat priss By him rentis and he be wiss, And grow in gentill kyth and kyn, Gif at grace be him within. I meyne nocht his necessite Till all tyme liffis in honeste, Outwart haiffand sufficians, And inwart vertuus haboundans; He may be callit a gentill man, That vertu and faire haiffing can.

CHAPTER LXVIII. How Cartage wes biggit agane Throu the Romanis mekle mayne. A hundreth and twenty ?ere beforne And ane þare to or God was borne, The Romanis in þat samyn quhile To Cartage send of thare famyle For to big vp agane the tovne, And mak þare thare inhabitatioun, And for to hald it fra that day To Rome tributere alway; That xx. ?eris and twa wes eft That it wes brynt in colis left. The hill of Ethna þan of fyre Brak out and brynt in colis schyre All the houssis of that cete, That neire it wes as first said he, And for þat cause thai freschit ware Fra tribut gevin tene ?ere, Sa þat þai mycht relevit be To big agane thare brynt cete. CHAPTER LXIX. How the Romanis with seire nationis facht And vincust þaim for all thare maucht. A hundreth winter and ellevin Or Mary bare þe King of Hevin, The Romanis with thare consules In weire and batall movit wes Aganis sindry regionis, As Duche and Franche nationis, That set haly thare entent, Bunding togidder be ane assent, The Romanis for till haue vndone; And thare apone thai assemblit sone In fecht, quhare þat þe cite?enis, Withoutin vther out Romanis, Foure score of thousand were slane doune, Besyde thai without the tovne, Fourty thousand reknyt haill, Off Romanis slane were in batall; Sex skore of thousandis in that fycht Slane were and to dede wes dycht. That fechting wes of sic fellony That bot ten men alanerly Off the Romanis fra þat place Eschapit for to tell þe cace. Than þai of Rome gret murnyng maid And houering in gret [dowt] thai baid, For thai dred saire at þat men?e Suld wyne and tak vp thare cete. The Duchemen and thai of Symbry, To gidder knyt in cumpany, In Ytaly as thai abaid, Lang soiorne thinkand till haif maid Thame to refresche in winter tyde, And frostis fell for till abyde. The Romanis with thare consules, Or thai to fecht arrayit wes, Brak apon þame sodanely, And slew þame dispitiously; Bot thai of Rome for that dispite Wes nocht ?it all of scaith quyte, For of þame mony were slane thare; Thare vengeance ?it reknyt ware A hundreth and vi. thousand deid, And presoneris tane in þat steid Wer reknyt sevinty thousand gud, Withoutin a gret multitud Off wemen wedand in wodnes, And for dule falling in hevynes; Sa thai thare put þaim self to deid And slew thare childer but remeid. In memor of that victory The Romanis gert big vp in hy A fair tempill, at þat gert thai Be Cembry callit efter ay, That king wes haldin in honour, Neir Sanct Mary þe Maiour. CHAPTER LXX. How þe Romanis wiþin þare tovne Faucht felly and slew oþer dovne. Four score of winter and sevintene Or lichtare wes the Madin clene, The stait of Rome begouth to be Stad in hard perplexite, Amang þaim self devisit sa That thai were like gret scath to ta, Na ware þe hap it sessit sone, Fra the Romanis to dede were done, Throu counsall of the consules, That the first movare of it wes; Than throu felloune takinnis seire The Romanis all breit were. [At] Carentyne, [als] thai were set Apone a day all at the mete, Apone þe burde out of þare breid Thare bruschit out þe blude all rede; And neire by in ane vther place The erd thare claif and opinnit wes, And a low out of þat ryft Straik vp evin neire to þe lyft, And alkyne tame best, less and mare, That amang þaim liffand were, Left thare hant and als þare fude, And ?oulland ran as thai were wod To woddis and to wildernes, Leiffand thare avne wontsumnes; And hundis als, at ay kyndly Luffis menis cumpany, Ran wild as wolffis to the wod, Gowland in gret multitude. And fra þat þir takinnis were done Wther chanses hapnit sone, For Iulius Cesar in Sampnyt Wes with his haill ost discomfyt, Till all his men bot he allane In to that land were slane and tane. Pompeyus wencust wes alsua, And in till vther landis ma All the Romanis were full qwit In to thare weris discomfyt. Therfor the senatouris a clething Maid þaim in takyne of murnyng, And Iulius Cesar in þat weid Wes with þaim cled; bot syne but dreid, Efter sindry iuperdyis, Quhare vencust were his innemeis, That garmond he put fra him sone, And vther has vpone him done. Pompeyus alsua þe pretor, That wes discomfyt oft befor, Wan and had gret victoryis In batall and in iuperdyis. Askalone with his powere He assegit and wan of weire, Quhare xviii. thousand were tane, Bot thai that deit with þare chiftane. The commonis of Rome were sa fell Aganis the senage, and sa cruell, Sa violent, and als sa keyne That sic forouth wes neuer seyne; For þan of Rome þe commonis seire Faucht agane ane Silla, but weire, And of thame mony faucht alsua Aganis vther with Silla. Silla þan a Roman wes, Ane chosin of þe consules. The Romanis in to thai dayis Be thousandis, as Frere Martyne sais, Innomerable within that ficht, With dyntis doure to deid were dycht. Till thai in were were wedand þus A Roman callit Tantillus Said to Silla apon þis wise: “With weris and iuperdyis We sla all armyt and nakit doune, That ?it releve wald our renovne, And pure men we sla in þis press That wald ws help to wyne prowes.” Than Silla maid for that ressoune A table of proscriptioun, Sa that first proscrivit ware Foure score of thousand men and mare, And five hundreth efter thai Proscrivit were throu þis Silla. Sa were the Romanis fra thare steid Out exild, or slane, or deid, And this weire ciuile ten ?eire out Contenit wes withoutin dout, And of the Romanis slane þan were A hundreth and fifty thousand there; And efter þat deid wes þis Silla, And other gret of Rome alsua. Pompeyus than the Orient Werrayit with strenth and hardyment, And faucht with xxii. seire Kingis and princis of gret powere. CHAPTER LXXI. How Iulius Cesar wes done to deid Throu tressoune in his awne steid. Foure score of ?eris bot ane less Befor þat God of Mary wes Borne, of Frans the regionis To Cesar and sevin legiones Gevin and deliuerit wer, And wan of weire within v. ?ere. Off Tyburtyne þe grete cete With his powere distroyit he; All France and Brettane syne of weire To Rome he maid baith tributere, And a brig he gert mak syne Attour þe gret watter of Ryne. All Ducheland syne he our raid, And tributere to Rome it maid. All thir dedis quhen he had done To Rome he tuke his vayage sone, For till haue bene in that cete With mare honour, as thocht he, For his hie worschip resauit, Bot ?it thareof he wes dissauit; For thai of Rome fra him thus Inclynit þan to Pompeyus, And wald on na wyss till him do Sic honour as efferit him to, Na wald nocht mak of thare tresoure His costis, as thai did befor. Agane thare willis þan forthi In to the tovne for his mastry He enterit, and in hy he brak There tresoure house, and syne can tak Off thare tresoure a gret deill, Baith of money and ioweill; And sowth in weris syne he past Till he in Spayne come at the last; And, for to tell ?ow now schortly, All tyme him fell the victory. In Ytaly syne turnyt he To fecht with Pompeyus men?e, And Pompeyus with stoutnes To fecht with him arrayit wes. Quhare, efter strang and hard batall, Pompeyus fast begouth to faill, And Pompeyus at þe last Turnyt abak and fled full fast, And passit throu [Asy] to Tyre, And syne till Egipt, quhare of he wes syre. That tyme þe king Schir Tholonie There tuke and gert sla this Pompe. Syne of his fingere he gert ta His ring, and his heid alsua He gert smyte of, and baith he send To Iulius Cesar in presend, That in till Alexandere abaid, Fra he þe chaiss of Pompe maid. Quhen he þe heid saw and þe ring Off Pompey, þan in greting He fell, and menyt saire þat he Off þat manere suld endit be. Iulius Cesare þat tyme þare Aryvit in the Yle of Faire, And of that ile lord þan wes A man of gret mycht, Achilles; Agane þis Cesare he tuke fycht, Thare slane wes mony douchty knycht Off Iulius Cesaris cumpany, And thare thai slane were halely That Pompeyus men first slew. Than Iulius till his schippis drew, And in that passage þan he wes Set in till sa hard distres That in till bait quhen he Wes gane and [in] it maid entre, Throu the gret charge þat it bare, In the se it sank rycht saire; Bot fra that bait in to þe se He lap, and thare in swomand he Held on till his schippis fast; Twa hundreth paiss sa he past, Haldand outwith the watter ay His a hand as he swame þat day, And sa held all his letteris dry, In his hand closit prevely, Till his galay quhill þat he Come and in it maid entre. Off Alexander þe ost alhaill On se gaif him thare batall, Quhare baith thare navyne and thare king Wes takin thare throu hard fechting; Bot thare king of curtasy, At thare asking rycht thraly, He leit pass hame but ransone fre, And frendfully him counsalit he All his besynes to set Off the Romanis for to get Frendschip, tendernes and luf, And nakyne weire agane þaim mufe. Bot ?it the king, fra he wes fre And set þus in his awne pouste, Left his counsall, all for?et, And for the weire alhaill him set; Bot throu this Iulius he wes qwit Our se efter þat discomfyt, And twenty thousand of his men Were slane in to þat iurnay then, And xii. thousand men wes thare Slane with Iulius Cesar. Thre score and ten of galais lang Wes lossit and drownyt in þat thrang, And in þat press also thare king, That wes of age ioly and ?ing, In to that batall wes sa mait That prevely he gat a bait, And on the land þan wald haif past, Bot Iulius ost on him sa fast Followit, and with sa gret press That slane in to þe fecht he wes, And efter þat apon þat sand, Quhare mony bodyis slane þai fand, And casting vp, þat king wiþ crovne Thai knew weill be his haberioune With gilt mal?eis, for in þat place Like till it nane funding wes. Till Alexander þan Iulius send That haberione, for thai it kend, And for dispaire the toune þan wes ?oldin vp to Cleopatras, To quham þis Iulius gaif alhail Off Egipt all the gouernall. And syne he past throu Surry, And wan gret landis and sen?eory, And efter þat to Rome come he, And wes relevit till hieare gre; For dytour þat tyme thai him maid, And for counsall als but baid. Syne Spayne and Affrik baiþ of weire To Rome he maid þaim tributere, And efter that in Rome wes he Ressauit with gret rialte. Than vii. monethis and thre ?ere, Quhen all thir weris endit were, The stait he held as emperour, And in worschip and honour; Bot with twa traytouris syne, allace! He wickitly distroyit wes. The tane of thai hecht Cassyus, And the tother wes callit Brutus; And ?it men said at sexty ma Wes consentand to thai twa, That in to court all sodanely Stekit him rycht fellonly With scharp punsonys, and thai [thair] Fourty and xx. woundis saire Gaif him, and þus þat thai Wes fellonly him slayand swa, And he amang þaim þare bledand, He stude vp, and with his rycht hand Off his skyrt a lap he schare, And couerit þare with his ene baire, And with his vthir hand held doune The tother lap þare of his govne Behind him laygh, þat nane suld se Spot, fylth na vnhoneste Behind him in his doun falling, And thus it wes his last ending. After þat xxvi. ?ere Off his eild wes passit cleire, His body deid the pepill syne Beriit, and maid of marbill fyne A pillare xx. fut on hicht, And it þai gert be set vp rycht In the merget, and þare gert þai The powdyre and the banys lay. Off Iulius deid, as I herd tell, In Rome vnkouth takynnis fell; Befor his dede the hundreth day Off fyrflaucht fell brynt alway The first letter of his estate The men apon his ymage wrait, Quhen it wes first vpset Evin in to the myd mercat. C that letter capitalle Is set in nomer vsuall For a hundreth, and forthy The Romanis had a fantasy That C of Cesare wes away, That about þe hundreth day, Quhare in moneth or in moment, Be the last day, thare entent Off that nomere were hoverand, And sodand signis abydand. Off the nycht nixt gane biforne That Iulius slane wes on þe morne, As he in his awne chalmer lay In till his bed lang forow day, A sudane thud maid sic a frusch That all the wyndois at a brusche Off his chalmer quhare he lay Brak vp, and he in a fray Stert out of his bed with þat, And lichtly one his [solis] gat For all þat houss richt þan he wend Off his lif þan suld maid end. Quhen he wes dede within his hand Thai prive letteris writtin fand, That warnyng of his deid had bene, Gif [he] befor wald þaim haif sene. In till this ilk tyme in Scotland Gede oure the Pightis wes regnand. The stait of Rome first gouernyt wes With kingis, befor consules, Twa hunder ?eris foure score and sevin, As Frere Martyne reknys evin; Four hundreth winter and twenty And foure to þai, to compt lely, Off Rome þe gret stait gouernyt wes All be chosin consules, That till this Iulius Cesare haill Tuke till him þe gouernall. CHAPTER LXXII. Off Octoviane þe emperour And of his hap and his honour. Twa and fourty ?eris beforne Or Ihesu wes of Mary borne, Octoviane than, nevow To Iulius þat þe Romanis slew, Raiss of Rome baith lord and syre, And stoutly gouernyt the empyre. Five fell batallis in his ?outhheid He did, and preffit gret manheid. The first of thai five and the last, That I haif lichtly heire oure past, He did stoutly with Marcus, Be surname hattyne Antonyus. Quhen xv. winter wes bigane Fra fyrst begouth Octoviane For to regne, in sic plente Off Rome þe thesaure ekit he, The stait, þe worschip and þe fame, That þai þan ekit till his name August, þat in propirte Ekyne or nobilite Betakynnis, and all emperouris syne Haldis that still ?it in Latyne; And sa the Romanis fra þat day Callit him Cesare August ay; And, as I said, his successouris, That succedis till emperouris, In the titill or thare stait All tyme Cesare August wrait; And all the empyre efter þan Fra þin wes subiect till a man, And he the first wes lord and syre Off all the warld aucht the empyre, And wes callit in Grew forthy Fra þin furþ the monarchy; Off all the warld, that is to say, Lord he wes haill in till his day. Syne þis ilk Octoviane With batall wan þe landis of Spayne, And mony vthire landis seire Off weire he wan with his powere. In thai dais all Pannony, That merchis neire wiþ Wngary, Tiberius, his stepsone, With felloune slauchter had vndone; And Ducheland is callit Germany, Lyis strekand fra Pannony To the gret ryvere of Ryne, As Orosyus sais and Martyne. Thai say thai ryveris thre Off Germany suld callit be, Alba, that throu Bewm rynnis, And Adra, þat neire it begynnis, And þe Gissill, that in Pillens land Begynnis, and throu it is rynnand. Tiberius wes than werreyand Thre ?eris in to Ducheland With xii. legiones of knychtis gud, That neire thare sa cruell stude That nane wes till it of outrage, Outtane the fell weire of Cartage; For þan of Rome thare legiones thre Were slane and tane in þat cuntre, And ilk legioun is vi. thousand Sex hundreth sexty and sex, beand Cuþer of angellis, men, or devillis, Ihesu defend ws fra thire euillis! Bot efter þat till hie empyre Octoviane, þan lord and syre, Wan all thare landis halely, Off all the warld the monarchy; Monarchy in Grew I wiss The warld round haill it is. He duelt in quyet and in pese, And emperour þare of haill he wes, Regnand in gret ryalte, In honour, stait and maieste, That all þe men of his empyre Nocht anerly him lord and syre, Or emperour thai wald him call, Bot for haill counsall, thai said all, For his hie price and his valour, As god þai wald him haill honour. All his tyme wes vnyte In all þe warld and cherite, And ilk man of ane accord, And kend him anerly for þare lord; There to þe Ewangell beris witnes, For intill his tyme Crist borne wes. He passit nocht, withoutin weire, Off eild ane and twenty ?ere Quhen he first wes maid emperour, Bot it he led in gret honour; Sa for his price and his gud fame August þai ekit till his name; Syne of his name þat moneth ay Is August callit to this day; Befor þan Sextile it wes callit. Be this ensampill ?it we hald it, The moneth nixt it followand, The first at Merche begynnand, And sa be nomyre þaim to tell, Five per ordre as þai fell; Bot now fra August nomer we, The moneth per ordre ?e se Fra August to December, And syne begynnis at Ianuer, And Februare nixt it followand, And þir twa monethis, ?e vnderstand, ?e may fynd in þis tretyss, Quha gert þaim be set on þis wiss; Bot Sextyle turnyt þe name In August for the ryall fame Off Octoviane, for þat he With Antone maid þat gret melle Off þat moneth þe first day; For thi thai call it August ay. In till þe xxv. ?ere Off his empyr, withoutin weire, The pohete þan in Rome Orass Deit, and þare beryit wes. Virgill deit in Burdyis, His body in till Napillis lyis. And in to the xxx. ?ere Off his empyr, withoutin weire, All þe warld in quyet wes, In cherite, lufrent and pess, And he regnand in maieste, In honour and in ryalte, Commendit of gret douchtynes, Off largyte and of worthynes; He wes at poynt proper and plesand, Honest, abill and avenand, Faire of fassoune and of face, And large of lyme and lyth it wes, Cunnand, curtass and cumly, Off latis nocht licht, bot lufly. And he þus regnand lord and syre, All the warld wes his empyre, Tharfor he set him for to wit, And for to put in autentick writt All kinrikis and all regionis, All citeis, cuntreis, castellis and tovnis, And quha þai landis were haldand, Possedand or inhabitand, And all þe names of þai regiones, Castellis, cuntreis, citeis and tovnis, And all thare names þat duelt thare in, Baith ?oung and auld, and mare and myn, Breiffit vp in writt and roll, And registerit be name ilk poll; And efter þat, foroutin baid, Fra thare were summondis to þaim maid, That euerilk man in þare cete, In to þe quhilk steid borne wes he, Or ellis to þat ilk tovne That cheif were of þat regioune, Suld cum, and thare for his awne poll Pay his trewage and his toll, Off gud siluer a denere, That soundis ten in nomer here. A denere, to say schortly, In oure langage is a penny; Bot þat denere þat þai suld pay Wes þan of valew in that day Ten penneis vsuall þan, That in to Rome for money ran, Haiffand the emperouris dyademe In it, and his ymage seyne, All about it þe circumscriptioun, Writtin weill sa invyroune; And þat ilkane offerit in knawlege To þe emperour for homage, That þai suld to Rome of det, Sen þai were maid till it subiect; And þat þai callit professioun, And sum callit it discriptioun; Bot professioun in propirte Granting with mouth may callit be, For quhen þai payit þe trewage With mouth þai grantit þat homage, And abussin ilk personis poll, There name writtin and þere toll; Discriptioun is writting In till oure langage vndeying, For all þare names writtin ware That payit toll, baith less and mare, And ?it ilk kinrik, land and tovne, By that laid þare trewage doune; In citeis maire or alderman At thai bodyis first began, And ilk man tald wes be his poll, And laid his trewage doune and toll, And in the citeis of ilk land Wes certane deputis resavand; Within Rome wes the trewage tane That þir bodyis payit ilkane. On þis wiss baith be land and tovne To Rome wes maid contributioun, And Cesare August, lord and syre, Aucht all the warld in ane empyre; Sa excellent in all bewte Till ilk manis sicht wes he That to behald him inkirly Men had gret liking generaly; Sa happy wes he als in deid That all thing at his liking ?eid, And till his purposs and his thocht, And all at eiss his will wes wrocht. The senatouris [alhaill] for thy Gaif him for counsall fermly Oure all þe warld þat he A god suld gere him callit be, Bot he kest weill intill his thocht, A dedly man [sen] he wes wrocht, Oure him he had a creature That aucht of ressoune that honour, And till vsurp till him þat name It were but vainglore and defame. Sua þat fra he herd þare entent, And efter thare avissment, Sybill Tiburtyne þat tyme in hy He callit, and tald [hir] halely Off the senaturis entent, And quhat [was] thare avissment. [This] Sybill a woman was In to Rome, and haldin a prophes, That is to say of halynes Scho wes inspyrit and of grace. The space of thre dais fellely Scho askit to byde in hir study; And thai thre dais in fasting Scho baid and in till thra praying, And syne as in till prophecy Scho maid efter þat study Iudicii signum in to verss, That were lang now to reherss; Bot thai are maid of Cristis birth, And of his deid and rysing with, And of his come to þe day of dome, And of takinnis þat befor sall cum. The emperour vp þan to þe hicht Scho gert behald, and sic a lycht Him vmbelappit in þat place That þare of gretly affrayit he was; And syne he saw a madin faire Apone ane altare in þe aire, And ane litill barne alsua Haldand in hir armes twa; And, till he ferlyit of þat sycht, He herd a voce þat said him rycht: “?one þov wit withoutin hone The altare is of Goddis Sone.” Than to þe erd rycht sodanely He fell, and prayit deuotly, With greting on his kneis baire, In honour of þat blessit paire; And syne the senatouris gert he call And tald þaim þare þir faire sycht all, Quhare of þai ferlyit rycht gretly. That chalmer syne full deuotly, In honour of þat paire sa fre, With gret worschip hallow gert he; For þare he saw that visioun That raissit his deuocioun; There in a kirk of oure Lady Is, and Freris Minoris ythandly In to þat ilk chapell alway Seruice God baith nycht and day; And þat kirk foundit in þat place Syne Ara Celi callit wes, Bot in oure leid it is to say The altare of hevin or God verray. Bot quhen the contributioun Wes payit, baith of land and tovne, Off Na?areth and Galyle Ioseph þat tyme in Iude Passit to the cete Dawy, With his spouss myld Mary, Bethlem callit in þat quhile, For [of] þat house and þat famyle He wes of kyne and of renovne; Forthy þare his professioun For to mak he sped him ?arne With Mary his spouse with barne. Bot all the innys euerilkane, Or thai come to þe tovne, wes tane; And þan þare wes sic multitude Within that tovne of men and gud That to pure men it wes ill For to get herbery at þare will; And þarefor Iosephe and Mary Within houss mycht get na herbery, Bot betuix houssis twa Quhare men had gert a [pentiss] ma To hald confabulatioun Efter thare recreatioun Off meit and drink, and thare repaire Quhen þaim likit to tak þe aire. Thare Ioseph wiþ Mary [his] spouss His innys tuke into þat houss, And thare intill his bestis twa, Ane oxe and ane ass were thai; The oxe he had to the tovne to sell, To pay for tribut at þaim fell, The ass to beire his spouss sa myld, For scho wes neire hir tyme wiþ child. To thai twa bestis a crib he maid, Or maid perchans he funding had, He band þaim vp and gaif þaim hay; And þat ilk nycht, or it wes day, That madyne baire þat blessit byrth That is the causs of all our myrth.

Arboc als, the king of Mede, Off quham forouth ?e herd me rede, Rewillit Babulone þat ?ere That Prochess in Rome begouth to steire; And sa Oross signifyis, The west kynrik begouth to ryse As the est begouth to faill Be [misfortoune] and fell batall, Quhare throu þe warld wes halely All redact in a monarchy, That is to meyne in ane empyre, And a man of it lord and syre. Sa now my purposs and my will, Gif God wald grant me grace þaretill, It is my entent for till schaw, And clerely als to gere ?ow knaw All the causs materiall Off þe doubill gouernall, That is to say of spiritualite, And the toþer of temporalite; The temporall is the less, but let. Thir ar þe twa gret lichtis set In myddis of þe firmament, That vsit are to represent And to minister thare seruice Tyme be tyme and thare office. Off thir twa lichtis that I of say The gretare lycht is for þe day, And for the nycht the less alsua God maid, to man seruice to ma; And þire twa staittis gret alsua Signifyis the suerdis twa Quhareof a speciall mencioun Is said in Cristis passioun: “Lord, lo! now twa suerdis heire.” “Ynew are þai,” wes his ansuere. In to the Pape is þe honour, The stait, þe worschip and þe cure, And þe gretest gouernall; And of the less stait alhaill The souerane is þe Emperour, Be worschip, titill and honour. Off papis and emperouris how it fell It is my purpose now to tell. CHAPTER LXXIV. Heir it tellis of Cristis byrth And of seire mervallis als tharewith. Cesar August Octoviane Quhen that fourty ?ere and ane Off his empyre wes passit cleire, Within þe twa and fourty ?ere, Apone the Sonday within nycht, Mary myld, þe madin brycht, But thristing, thrawing or disese, Or ony smyt, deliuer wes Off hir a sone, God and man. That child scho tuke sueitly þan, And in a cryb syne laid he was Betuix ane oxe all and ane ass; Thir twa bestis deuotly One kneis fell, as witnes the story, Kend thare wes thare creature; Tharfor þai did þare him þat honour That apon kneis ay were thai Sittand, till þat he thare lay. His moder held bed in iesyng, But dout ?it wes scho clene virgyne. He name and circumsicioun, And scho purificatioun Tuke, þat tyme þat ordanit wes Be law ordanit of Moyses, And þe child wes Ihesu cald, As þe angell forouth tald; And sa thai baith kepit rycht weill The lawis statut ilk deill. Our Lord Ihesu þus wes borne To sauf mankynd that wes forlorne. Be?ond Tybyre, as I herd tell, Out of þe erd þare sprang a well Off cleire oly, faire and gud, Quhare quhile a faire taverne stude; Till that day in gret copy That well [ran] oure haboundanely, That helis sindry seik of ill, And ?it mare I herd tell hir till. A serkill about the sone þat day Wes sene schynand, as I herd say, That till þe raynebow be liknes Apperith, as þe writt witnes. That ilk nycht, as I herd tell, In Rome þe gret temple doune fell, That quhen the Romanis befor xii. ?ere In pess and quyet liffand were, In the honour of Romuly fre, Off fyne metall gert foundit be Off Romulus a faire figure Off fyne hewis and clene payntour, And vthere symulachris seire And ydolis þat þan worschippit were, That set were in that temple faire, Quhare men maid hanting and repaire, For to mak þare sacrifice To thare mawmentis apon thare wiss With full deuote solempnyte And vsuall festiuite. This tempill baire þe titill of Pese, For, first quhen þat it foundit wes, Till Appolyne þare orysone Thai maid þan wiþ deuocioun, Certane knawlege for to get How lang that temple sagatis set, And foundit sa in þe honour Off Appolyne thare gouernour, Suld lest and stand but confounding. And þis wes þan þare ansuering Off thai mawmentis it till endure Ay quhill a virgin pure Suld beire a barne of hir body; Thare of the Romanis had ferly. And nocht for thi thai gert full tyte In till gret brokin letteris writt Out with the kirk dure at þe entre, That all men mycht it reid and se, Templum pacis eternum; ay Thir thre wordis ar for to say, The temple of Pess withoutin end. Bot quhen þat Goddis sone wes send To tak our kynd, as ?e herd tell, That temple and þare goddis fell, And thai symulachris all Were brokin in to pecis small. Fra þe Orient kingis thre, Ilkane seire in þare degre, Be þe sterne at led þaim trew Borne þe king of Iowis þai knew; And for þat causs þat fere vyage Thai tuke in deuote pilgrymage, Till thai come to Ierusalem. Fra þin þai past to Bathlem; Thare to þe sone of þe Virgin And myre and sens, and gold full fyne With gret deuocioun offerit thai, Efter his byrth þe xiii. day; And quhen thai had maid þare offerand Thai went on hame to þare land By Ierusalem passit thai, As thai wer warnyt, ane other way; And be þat King Herrod persauit That he wes quayntly þare dissauit; Tharfor þe innocentis gert he Be slayne throu his iniquite. Haly kirk ?it prechis cleire It in þe gospell ilk ?ere, And for that causs heire will I Pass it oure þe mare lichtly. In Scotland that ?ere Terand raiss, And oure the Pightis regnand was A hundreth ?ere as crovnit king; And quhen his lif had tane ending, Duchill raiss as king with crovne, And regnyt be successioun; Bot of þare douchty dedis seire I fynd nocht for to write in heire. Kenelin þan callit Kenant His sone efter him wes regnant As king with crovne of all Brettane. Befor þat with Octoviane He nurist wes in his ?outhheid, Till at he cummyn wes to manheid, And did gret worschip and bounte In alkin weire or gret iurnee, And tuke syne of þat emperour The ordre of knychtheid wiþ honour. To þaim of Rome for þat ressoune He had rycht gret effectioun, And all þe tyme þat he wes king, And Brettane had in gouernyng, His barnage haill said he mycht Withhald þat tribut wiþ all rycht, That Iulius Cesare befor wan, And wes payit till Octoviane þan. Agane þe will of his barnage To Rome he payit that trewage; Thare with his þe were wes he Commendit in till all degre. And in that samyn ?ere alsua Ioseph passit and Maria In till Egipt, and vii. ?ere Thare with Ihesu thai wonnand were. Bot of his dedis in that quhile I fynd bot few in the Ewangile; Bot quhasa likis for to reid In till the buke of his barneheid, He may fynd how be the way Wndere a palme tre thai lay, As for to sleip or rest þaim þare, As pilgrymes þat fortyrit were, The moder maikles of the child, Mary brycht, the madyn myld, Wes in to scharp hungere set, And had gret appetite till ete The crope than of þat palme tre, That datis bare on gret plente; Till þat scho wes in þat thraw, With all the bowis bowit law Doune till hir hand, sa at hir will Daittis scho pullit and eit hir fill; Syne as with leif, but braid or bend, Evin as befor stude vp on end. That tyme alsua Ioseph thare In till hard thrist wes angerit saire, Bot of the erd sone sprang a well, And thare Ioseph, as I herd tell, Drank his fill of watter cleire. Thare efter, as thai herbryit ware Within a gret coif and a deip, Or thai begouth to fall on sleip, Out of that coife all sodanely Twa gret dragonis and vgly Ruschit out; there Mary wes And Ioseph baith in gret radnes; Bot þai twa fell dragonis kene Fra þai the barnis hede had sene, As þai had chastyit bene, with aw Thai kest thare hedis doune weill law, And worschippit þaim, and syne wiþ speid To wildnernes thare way thai ?eid. Fra þin till Egipt in tyll hy As Ioseph passit and Mary, A lyoune ?emyt be the way, That seruiciable wes to þaim ay In till Egipt till thai were fre; And, in it as þai maid entre, Off Egipt þan the tempillis all Fell and brak in pecis small; All thai ydolis brak ilkane, That in all þat land wes nane Temple standand of valoure, Na of nane ydoll nor figoure. There myraklis writtin ?e may fynd and reid In till a buke of his barneheid. Fra þin Ioseph, he and Mary Duelt in Egipt continewaly, Ay till þat þe angell brycht Apperit till Ioseph on a nycht In till his sleip, and bad him ta The moder and the barne alsua, And pass in Israell agane; For thai ar deid at wald haif slane The child; þan, but langere hone, Richt as the angell bad has done; Bot for causs, as þe story sais, That Archilayus in thai dais, The quhilk sone þat tyme was Till Herrod, full of wickitnes, Off Ierusalem þan wes king, And had it all in gouernyng, And duelt in it continewaly, For þis causs Ioseph and Mary Past with the child [by] þat cete To Na?areth in Galile; And in that cete xv. ?ere Thai with þe child þere wonnand were, That wox of wit and vertu þan, Baiþ befor God and man. Sua xii. ?eris quhen he wes ald, As is in to the Ewangell tald, In Ierusalem amangis þe gret Doctouris of law, at held thare sete In to the temple for to schaw The caiss as thai stude in law, He sat, and wes rycht diligent To heire and mak sic argument That all that herd and stude him by Off his ansueris had ferly. And efter his natiuite Quhen xiiii. ?eris wes passit fre, Octoviane the emperour Deit in Rome with gret honour, Quhen at sex and fifty ?ere Off his empyre wes passit cleire. All the warld, as I said eire, He maid to Rome þare tributere; In his begynning the cete All about of Rome fand he Dykit bot with faill or mude, Bot, or he deit, of mater gude As syment, lyme or hewin stane, He maid the wallis euerilkane. Off cite?enis and burgess fre He left wonnand in that cete Foure hundreth thousand nynty syss, And fourty thousand thare to twiss, As sayis Frere Martyne in his buke, Quha will his corniklis rede or luke. ?it þocht he wes of this bounte, He wes nocht all in vicis fre, For he had in till vsage oft Amangis twelf maddinnis, ?oung and soft, Ay quhen him likit, for to ly In lykyne, lust and lichory. CHAPTER LXXV. How Tyberius wes successour Nixt till Octoviane the emperour. The xv. ?ere efter þe byrth That causit all oure mekle myrth, Off Rome Tyberius emperoure, Nixt till Octoviane successour, His wiffis sone of lauchfull bed, And had to wif his dochter led; For causs of þat and his bounte Octoviane ?arnyt him to be His aire and his nixt successour; Sa fell at he wes emperour, And raiss of Rome baiþ lord and syre, And stout gouernyt þe empyre. In deid he doure wes and douchty, And in till armes rycht happy, Cunnand in to letterature syne, Baith sle and doutouss of engyne. Quhen men wald do be lyklynes His will, or quhat his bidding was, In fraude and swyke oft wald he say At that him likit be na way, And gere the doaris pvnyst be Throu wickitnes and cruelte. He wes weill pert and eloquent, And full astryng in iugement, And curtase he wes in till deid. In seire cornikillis of him we reid That quhen procuratouris maid he In his erandis passand to be, Seilding reuocatioun He maid of thare commissioun; He wald ger oft pyne and sla Theiffis and saikles men alsua. He tuke the trewage of Brettane That Iulius Cesare befor wan; He regnyt xx. ?eris and thre; In Chawmpane syne deid wes he; Feill folkis glaid were and ioly, And for his deid few folkis wer sary. Off Cristis dedis in þat quhile Few I fynd in þe Ewangell, Till þe tyme þat he hevin wes; Bot, as Ioseph beris witnes, And þus in till his story sayis, There wes a wiss man in þai dais, Gif men mycht wiþ ressonis all Properly a man him call, Bot of mervalus dedis thare He wes baith doare and kennare, And mony of Iowis and Gentill Till him he drew in to þat quhile. Sum haldis opinione at þis man Wes Crist him self, for ?it than He prechit nocht oure all publik, As he did efter opinlike. The pohete Ovide in thai dais Deit in exile, the story sayis. Off his empyre the xv. ?ere, And fra þe byrth of our Lord deire The threttyd ?ere, in wildernes Sanct Iohne the Baptist precheand wes. Than Pylat of Ponss procurit to be Kepare and prince of all Iude; Off Ponce as I said beforne Off Lyons in to France Surrone. That ?ere the Baptist als sanct Iohne Baptist Crist, as sais þe buke, And bapteme in flome Iordane tuke; The nixt ?ere efter syne He turnyt the watter into wyne. Sanct Iohne the Baptist [þare] wes tane, And efter þat a ?ere oure gane, Throu foly gret and cruelte, Herrode gert him hedit be. [Than] of Tiberius emperour Pilate wes maid procuratour, And specialie deput in Iudee. Sa fell þat under his pouste Crist tholit his passioun, And maid his resurrectioun, Quhen þat thretty ?eris and thre Wes gane fra his natiuite; And in till August of þat ?ere Sanct Stevin wes stanyt to ded, but weire, And þat samyn ?ere alsua Saull Wes conuertit, and callit Paull. The emperour Tyberius efter þat, Quhen þat he full wittering gat [That] Ihesu Crist to dede wes done, Than send he efter Pilat sone, And in his presens him gert he Off fals jugisment accusit be; Bot efter thai accusationis, And his fals excusationis, To Wyene in to Burgone he Him send and gert him presound be, That he wes lang in sorow and caire, And slew him self for sorow þare. Herrod als, at slew sanct Iohne, He gert banyss with him onone To Wyene in to Burgone als With his felloune wif and fals, Herodias, and thai twa Wrechitly þare deit alsua. Efter the resurrectioun Off Crist and the ascensioun, Sanct Peter, þe appostill fre, Borne of the land of Galile, And in the Rew Bethsaida, (He wes þe sone of Iohne alsua, And to sanct Andro broþer haill,) Past in þe landis Orientaill, And in thai lands thare held he Fully foure ?eris þe prestis se; And thare he sang þe first mess That in this warld first soungin wes, And in þat mess wes said na mare Bot Pater Noster þare. Tyberius þat tyme wes dede, And Gayus raiss in till his steid; This ilk Gayus wes alsua Be surname callit Gillicola. Off the empyre lord wes he Bot monethis x., and ?eris thre, And viii. dais, and ?it he wes Viciouss and full of wickitnes, And full of lust and lichory; His awne twa sisteris he lay by; A dochter on ane of þaim he gat And þat he lay by efter þat; And ?it wes he nevo and neire To Tyberius, but weire; In cruelte and averice, And mony vthere sindry vice, Sa lang he rapit till at he was Slane with his in his place. And þus quhen dede wes þis Gayus, Till him succeedit Claudyus, That þe empyre xiiii. ?ere Gouernyt, and vii. monethis cleire, And xviii. dais fullely. Sanct Petyre þat tyme suthly At Antioche in Orient Sevin winter in gud entent Baid, and held the preistis se, And syne fra þin to Rome past he As bischop and preistis live Twenty ?ere he led and five, And dais viii., to hald the dait. Twa epistollis of cannone þare he wrait; In September þan ordanit he Ordouris ilk ?ere to be, Thire bischopis sex, and preistis ten, And dekinnis sevin he ordanit then. The fourtyid ?ere efter þat byrth That maid all our mensk and myrth, The ewangelist Sanct Mathew Maid and wrait his ewangelis new; And efter þat thre ?eris alsua Mark his ewangelis begouth to ma, And Sanct Petyre wrait þaim þare, For he forouth wes his scolare. In gret hungyr þat ilk ?ere The Romanis saire anoyit were; Appollinare Sanct Petyr þan Send to preiche þaim of Rawen, That is a cete gret and faire, Common and of gret repaire; In Ytaly peire till it is nane To sauf of Rome the tovne allane. CHAPTER LXXVI. Off the emperour Claudyus And of his successour Gayus. Claudius þe emperour, That wes to Gayus successour, Off his empyre þe fourt ?ere In Brettane past with his powere. King Belyns sone þat tyme wes king, And had it all in gouernyng, Assemblit his oste in hy, And with þe Romanis sturdely Faucht and put þaim to þe flycht, Quhare mony doure to deid wes dycht. And quhill þai wer fechtand in place, A Romane at amang thaim wes, Hamo callit, gat on þat sen?e That Brettonys baire; syne can him fen?e A Brettoner him for to be, For all þare langage weill knew he; For in till Rome he held ostilage Off diuerss nationis and langage, In till his houss reparit þan Mony þat tyme of Brettane, And for þis causs he knew rycht weill All þe langage ilk deill. Sa þat in þat batall He baire him as a Brettane haill, Till þat he come rycht to þe king, That of him had na mysleving; The king of Brettane thare he slew, And to the Romanis syne him drew. Arbigarus, þat wes þan Brothere to þis king Woden, That saw þis caiss and all þis deid, Gat apon him full gud speid All his broþer armour haill, And reskewit stoutly þat batall That his broþer led the king, And leit his oste wit na kyne thing Off þe caiss þat fell þe king, And maid rycht stout and full fechting, Till the Romanys tuke all the flycht, Quhare mony doure to deid wes dycht, And Hamo slane wes in þat chaiss; The emperour þare discomfit wes. And þus for to tell schortly The ending of þis iuperdy, Quhen Claudyus þe manheid kend Off the Brettanys, the message send Till Arbigarus, the king That Brettane tuke þan in leding, For till ameiss all weire and stryf, He tuke his dochter till his wif, And he to Rome suld tribut pay Withoutin gruching or dellay, That þe Romanis befor þan Fra his elderis of Brettane wan. Thus assentit wes the king To cess all weire and mak anyng; For he thocht sen þat generaly All vthere landis halely Baid vnder þare subiectioun Off Rome, þat he mycht but chesoun The tribut to the Romanis pay That þai tuke befor mony day. Sa, now schortly to mak end, Claudius for his dochter send; Betuix þe Romanis and þe king Thus maid wes pess and gud anyng And ?it vther cornikillis sais That þis king in till his dais Weddit Claudius dochter to wif, To put away all weire and strif. This emperour Claudyus of weire Past fra þin with his powere The Out Ylis till assaill, And with him in his suppowall That king passit of Brettane, And of forse þe Out Ylis wan, And maid þaim to Rome subiect ay, And gert þaim fra thin tribut pay. The emperour Claudius þan eft This king his luftennend left Of all landis that merchit þan With the kinrik of Brettane, Hame to Rome quhen that he Agane past with his ryalte, And how þis king syne maid lay And denyit haill to pay To Rome þe tribut of Brettane, Till Claudyus send Waspasiane Outher with lufrent or with threte With þis king to fechte or trete, To gar him pay þat at he aucht, And how the quene thare maid þaim [saucht], The Brutt tellis it sa opinly That I will lat it now ga by. This Claudyus in all tyme was In his dedis full rekles, Na he couþ hald in na memore The thingis þat he did befor. It hapnit him in sodane strif That apon caiss he slew his wif; At evin to bed quhen at he past Quhy scho come nocht he sperit fast. He thocht till ordane and to ma Be starne quhen that men suld lat ga Out of thare bodyis ryftis of wynd, Outhere befor or ?it behind, For wynd within is wickit thraw, Tharfor he thocht quhen men suld blaw Till ordane tyme be statut sa That men suld tharefor na way. He wes the mast sober man Off meit or drink that liffit than. Massalyne men callit his wif, Scho spendit in sic lust hir lif That hir oiss wes commonely In bordaill nycht and day to ly; Of that play scho wes neuer sad For all þe copy þat scho had, And ladyis scho tretyt ay In cumpany to pruf that play; And ?it with counsall of this wif, That þus in lust led all hir lif, Hir sone and his aire gert he Off the empyre disherist be, And Nero, that had his dochter weddit And lauchfully with hir had beddit, He ordanit of the empyre To be his aire, and lord and syre, And þat wes done agane the law, For luf of hir, or ellis for aw. Sanct Peter, as þe story sayis, Come to Rome first in his dais; Thare ordanit he befor Pasche day The Lentryne to be fastit ay Off fourty dais; syne oulkis thre That þe Aduent now call we, And quhilis it fallis mare and quhilis less, As the Sondais falland is; Bot the xl. dais ordanit he, That the Lentryne now call we, All Cristin men to fast and hald, That were full xiiii. ?eris ald. CHAPTER LXXVII. Off Nero and of his wickitnes That he did till he regnand wes. Nero nixt wes successour To Claudyus, and emperour Off gret Rome neire xv. ?ere, For oucht þat wantit to compt cleire. He pruffit weill of his manheid Till he wes knycht in his ?outhheid, Bot fra he wist him emperour, Than he excedit all mesoure, And worschip changeit in tyrandry, And knychtheid in to fellony; First he gert sla þe senatouris, That aucht to be his counsalouris, And als his brother he gert sla, And mony vþer lordis ma. Half Rome he gert set in fyre, A low there of for to se schyre. His moder vsit him to repruf, And snyb him as vnkynd of luf Till hir þat sufferit thristis saire, And panys hard quhen scho him baire, And in gret dout of hir lif ay In his bering þat nycht or day; But pete þare for or mercy He slew hir in his tyrandry. Syne gert he opin hir and out ta Hir bowellis, and seik in þa And rype oure all, baith thik and thyn, To seik the place þat he lay in. Off Rome syne the masteris all In his presens he gert call, And bad with barne thai suld him ma, Or ellis thai suld thare liffis forga. Than efter thare avisement Thai gert him apon ane assent In till a draucht of drink swelly A ?oung paddo, lyand in fry. Syne gert him in meit and drink Vse sic thing as thai couth think, Or be þare sciens vnderstud Wer to þat paddo gud. Syne efter it begouth to wax, And within him rerd and rax, And in his bowellis gnyp and gnaw, And gert him oft syse thole hard thraw, And in gret perell of the dede. Thare of þan to get remeid He gert thai gret clerkis all Agane in till his presens call, And bad thai suld, apone all pane Off tormentis seire for to be slane, Ger þat of his barne þat he Suld but delay deliuerit be. Than þai behuffit for to fynd, All excusationis put behind, Sum craft to lowss him of that payne, Or ellis but mercy to be slane. With a drink þan at the last Out at his mouth þai gert him cast That paddo with a bok of blude, Nane maid of fassoune and nocht gude. Than askit he be quhat ressoune His barne sa foull wes of fassoune, And thai ansuerd all in þat tyde, For he couþ nocht his tyme abyde, Na it mycht nocht lang lest in lif, For quhy it wes ane abortyffe, And þat wes borne befor the tyme, And þus þai put till him the cryme. That paddo deid efter gert he In till a toure enterit be, The quhilk wes maid wiþ lyme and stane, And it wes callit syne Lacarane. In all his dedis he wes felloune, And maid gret persecutioun Off Cristin men, for that thare fay Abhominabill wes till him ay. Off Iacob Iustus in his dais, And Phillip the appostill, þe buke sais, With a walkaris perk, but dout, He gert smyte thare harnys out. He gert als in his fellony sla His awne maister Seneca, That till Sanct Luke wrait letters seire, And wes his awne familiere. He tynt þe trewage of Brettane, That his elderis befor wan, And vther alsua realmes seire, That he fand to Rome tributere, Rane in till prescriptioun Off þare contributioun. He wes hiely and outragiouss, And of condicionis viciouss; Sanct Petyr he gert crucify, And of Sanct Paull in his fellony He gert ta of þe heid alsua, To deid he put thai appostillis twa. And quhen feill ?eris were cummyn and gane, Off his empyre þe last bot ane, The Grekis þan set þaim thraly Away till haif stollin prevely The bodyis of thai appostlis twa; And on þat purposs till þai were sa, Deuillis that in mawmentis ware, Throu Goddis will and his powere, Cryit to þe Romanis: “Succour now, ?oure goddis ar now stollin fra ?ow.” The Cristin men þat [þan] were gud, That of þe appostlis vnderstude, Bot þe paganys wenyt alway That of thare goddis þat said thai. With þat þe Romanis halely Chassit þe Grekis dispitously, Sa þat þe Grekis at þe last Behuffit of neid thai bodyis cast In till a deip stank, quhare thai Lay hid but witting mony day, Till þat þe pape Cornelyus, As þe cornikillis tellis ws, Drew þaim off þat cisterne deip, And honorably gert men þaim keip Till he had maid his orisoune To God with gret deuocioun, For to teche him verraly Quhilk wes of Peter the body, And quhilk of Sanct Paull mycht be The body in to properte. Deuotly sa till þat he sat, Inspirit of God ansuere he gat That þe largeare body was Off þe fischeare, and the less Off the precheoure; and þis said, Pape Siluester gert þaim be laid In till a weyis; sa kend wes þare Quhilk precheoure wes, and quhilk fischeare; And of ilk ane a kirk gert he Honorably syne foundit be, And of Sanct Peter with honoure The banys he put in sepulture In to the kirk wes for him maid, And the banys of Sanct Paull he had Wntill his kirk, and þan he Entyrit þare with solempnyte. Off Nero ?it þan emperoure, That turnit in foull lust his honour, For na part of a man thocht he Mycht clene or lufly callit be; All his men he lowit forthy In all tyme till vse rebaldry, And alkin vicis at thare will He gaif consent and leif thare till. A robe he wald on na kyne wyss Put apon his bak twiss, Bot a new robe ilk day His vsage wes till array, And to þe horse þat he on raid Schone of siluer he gert be maid. The houssis in till his palace Large and weill coruyt was In all poynttis euerilkane With gold and siluer and preciouss stane, Euer syne þat na man mycht Pryss þe cost of it to rycht. Forouth þe bernyng of the tovne, And for his dedis þat were felloune, His barnage set þaim him to ta, To pyne in presoune or to sla. For that causs out of his palace He fled, and slew him self of cass;, And outwiþ þe erd but sepulture As a dog lay þe emperour, Till all the flesche of his body Wes etyne with wolffis halely. Off Nero þus wes þe ending, And is ensample and taknyng Till all þat drawis thare delite To lust and to foull appetite, Throu warldis welth and wantoun will, Fra vertuouss deid to vicis ill, But ony ressoune bot revery, Confoundit pete with fellony, And will þare hawtane havinnis haif, And wenys nane may þaim dissaif. Gabba of Rome þan emperour To Nero neist wes successour; Off that stait ?it neuerþeless Bot vii. monethis emperour he wes. Quhen Nero herd of Surry tell That þai agane him raiss rabell, Waspasiane he send of weire In Surry with a gret powere; Thare in the kinrike of Iude Lyand apon weire wes he, And herd weill Nero wes dede, And Gabba syne intill his steid. And Witaill efter þaim regnand, And Oto als throu stalwart hand, All in þat ?ere were emperouris, And throu covatice of honouris Ilkane slew oþer of caiss; Off þaim sa the ending was. That tyme Lynus king of Tuskane Borne, and sone of Esculane, Alevin ?ere and monethis thre And xxx. dais held þe se Off Rome a pape, and ordanit þan That thare suld cum na woman Within þe kirk, as Peter bad, Bot gif hir heid scho couerit had. Quhen þat pape Lyne wes deid Clete succedit in his steid, And held þe papis se xi. ?ere In Rome; bot ?it thai twa were, As sum men sayis, in to thare lif Nouthir papis successive, Bot thai were to Sanct Peter ay Helparis in his lattyr day, Quhen he gaif his vacatioun Alhaill till his deuocioun; Baith Lyne and Clete thai papis twa He dispensit with to ma, And for to do þe seruice all That to þe pape of rycht suld fall; In till the nomer þare of þai Ar reknyt of haly papis ay. Clete commendit rycht gretly All thai that vsit deuotly Haly pilgrimage to ma, And maist ay he commendit þai That Sanct Peter and Paull vesyte, For that he callit maire meryt Than for to fast twa ?eris or thre; All thai thare for cursit he That lettit þaim of þare viage To Petyre and Paull in pilgrymage. In to the papis letters he Gert first Salutem writtin be, Et Apostolicam Benedictionem alsua; And fra he deit syne all thai That succedit in that stait Thai wordis in thare bullis wrait. CHAPTER LXXVIII. Off Wespasiane and of Titus And of þare liffing vertuouse. Eftir þat borne wes God of Hevin Thre score of ?eris and ellevin, Waspasyane wan halely All þe landis of Surry To þe empyre, and that day About Ierusalem he lay With his oste of gret powere, Assegiand it as man of weire, Quhen be letters till him send He [saw], and be þare tennoure kend That he wes chosin emperour. That stait þarefor with gret honoure He resauit in Palestyne; His sone Titus he cald þat tyme, And till him he commendit haill Off all his oste þe gouernaill. To Rome syne past he in hy, Thare he resauit wes honorably, And hugely commendit was Off his hie worschip and prowes. Syne in the flukis hapnit him to de, As mony dois oft, as we se; Bot in till his lattyr thraw, To deid quhen he begouth to draw, Evin vpon his feit he stude, And said with a haill voce and gud: “Ane emperour suld ay,” said he, “Hyare þan þe erd be.” And in that thraw he tuke þe deid; Titus his sone raiss in his steid, Off Rome lord and emperour, And gouernyt it thre ?eris with honour; He tuke and gert distroyit be Off Ierusalem the cete, And of þe Tempill he tuke haill All ennormentis and weschaill, And one to Rome all þai he send; Syne brynt þe Temple or he wend, And slew þe cete?anis all doune. Thare wes þe confusioune That ony man befor herd tell, That euer to the Iowis fell; For of the slane Iowis the blude Throu out the toune in till a flude One heid as welterand wawis ran, Or as a ryuere waxen þan. With suerd thare mony Iowis ware Slane, and mony deit thare In hungyre, for the Romanis haill Consumyt and held fra thaim vittaill; And of the Iowis that þaim ?ald To the Romanis thare thai sald Ay xxx. for a penny thare; ?it sellaris ma þan byaris ware, For þe Romanis þat tyme thocht That þe Iowis na thing socht Bot to be haldin in seruice; That gert þaim sell þame of sic price. In this Waspasyns dais And Titus, as the story sais, To Ierusalem this fell. Bot of Titus mare to tell, He wes of sa gret curtasy, Off sic pete, will and mercy, That quhen aganis his persoune Men ware of conspiratioune Accusit, and convict be law, Eftir iugisment he wald thaim draw, And kyss þaim, and forgif þaim all That till his awne persone suld fall, And als hamelely with thaim thare Tak as it neuer na ware, And got þaim oft syss forgifnes To lat þaim mend thare wickitnes. Als he excedit in larges All thai that befor him wes, Or in his tyme of ony degre; For quhy that day clene tynt callit he That na man come till aske him ocht; For quhat euer till him socht, He denyit neuer nathing That wes be ressoune his asking; For he vsit oft to say That nane suld sary pass away Fra ony prince, or lord or king, That come to ask ony ressonable thing. He wes sa worschipfull and vertuouss, And of dedis sa mervalus, That with all folkis of alkyne eild He wes haldin thare bliss and beild, And efter, quhen that deid wes he, All folkis of dyverse cuntre Gret for him and maid sic caire That mony of þaim had levare Till haif seyne seire of vþer kyn deid Or he had deit that wes thare reid. For his gret hie benignite, His worschip, vertu and bounte, He passit his fader in gud fame, And reknyt is forow him by his name, As in þe ryall and vertuouse buke ?e may find writtin, gif ?e luke. Quhen Petyre, Lyne and Clete wes deid, Sanct Clement sat in to thare steid Nyne ?eris pape and monethis twa, And tene dayis fully to thai. Eftir bapteme first ordanit he Cristin men confermyt to be, But it he said at na man mycht Full Cristin men be callit rycht; And syne to deid dispitously. He wes put and to martery, And that wes done throu Traiane, That emperour of Rome wes þan, And in the se his body lay And lyis ?it unto this day, In þat kirk at foundit wes Throu angellis deid and Goddis grace; And fra none of his evin beforne Till his evinsang on þe morne The se standis ebbit, at men may ga To þat kirk pilgrimage to ma, Quhare mony faire myrakle is kyd, As his legend witnessid. There efter Domytiane, the toþer Off Waspasitianis sonis, Titus broþer, Xiiii. ?eris of þe empyre And v. monethis wes lord and syre. He wes in his begynnyng Off gret mesoure in all thing, Bot efter in his stait wes he A viciouse man in all degre, That of his fadere þe gud name And of his brother þe ryall fame He fordid all halely Throu his vice with his fellony. The nobilest of the senatouris, That [were] the wisest counsalouris, He gert to fellone deid be done; Syne him self he gert call sone A god of powere and of mycht. A kirk thereof he gert dycht, A figour of him self gert he Off siluer fyne tharein set be, Or ellis of gold rycht fyne and pure, Weill fassonyt as of payntour. First to lordschip quhen he drew His syster sonis all he slew; Nixt efter Nero the fellovne He maid first persecutioun Off Cristin folkis, and thare fay Supprisit and held vnder ay; And þocht þat þis Domytiane Wes sone to gud Waspasiane, ?it wes he of condicioun Mare like to Nero the felloune, Than to fader or broþer to be Like in till ony degre. Als the ewangelist Sanct Iohne, That duelt þan in Ephesone, And the ewangelis opinly Wes prechand than throu Asy; Forthy þis ilk Domytiane Gert him arestit be and tane, And put to presonne in þat ile That Pathmos hecht; sa in that quhile The Apoculipsis thare he wrait, And exild baid sa in þat stait Till that this Domytiane Throu þe senatouris wes slane. And in till his tyme Sanct Dionyse And his feris in till Parise Off dede tholit the passioun; The temple þan of Pantheoun, Quhare þan wes Sanct Mary þe Round, Agrippa Marcus þat gert found, And þan þat temple, as men sais, Thus gatis wes foundit in þai dais. That quhen þe senatouris herd tell That the Persantis raiss rebell Agane þe stait of Rome, þan haill Thai ordanit apon set counsall To send furþ Marcus Agripa Apone þe Persantis weire to ma, For he wes provest of þe tovne And commendit of renovne; To þis thai thocht him for to trete, Bot, or thai his will mycht get For to schaw thaim his entent, He askit thre day avisment. Sua in his sleip, apone a nycht, A ?oung lady, faire and brycht, Apperit till him quhare he lay In till his bed, lang forouth day, And said scho hecht Sibill, but less, That moder of all goddis wes. Scho said there to this Agrippa That gif he till her hecht wald ma In þe honour of hir as scho Couth and [wald] teche him to do, To mak a temple, þat Persantis quyt He suld in batall discomfyte. To þat sone he gaif assent, And awowit in þat entent For to fulfill in till all thing Off þat faire ladyis ?arnyng. And on þe morne, quhen day wes lycht, All, as he saw in sleip þat nycht, To þe senatouris he tald haill, And syne gert ordane his batall With a gret navyne on the se, And knychtis wicht of gret bounte In v. legionis, and with þai quyte The Persantis haill he discomfyte, And agane þe tribut wan That þai payit to Octoviane. Syne for þis causs he maid onone That temple þat þai callit Pantheone, In honour of Sibill, but less, That wes haldin þan a goddess. And in the tyme Domytiane Throu his vnhap þe dede hes tane, And fell þare a schamefull ending For his wickit and euill liffing; With his þan slane he was Rycht sodanely in his palace, And Nerwa, quhen he wes dede, Wes emperour in till his steid. Bot this emperour stude nocht a ?ere And four monethis, to rekin cleire; He vndid and dampnyt haill, As wes gevin him be counsall, All þe statutis befor, ilkane, Off the felloune Domytiane, For þai foundit all of will, And ordanit outher but law or skill. Sa be that ordinance Sanct Iohne The ewangelist to Ephesone Passit agane of presoune fre, Quhare weill ressauit with all wes he. CHAPTER LXXIX. Off þe wedow þat maid hir mayne To the rychtuise emperour Trayiane. A hundreth ?eris and twa gane Fra God of Mary flesche had tane, A Greke borne of the regioun And of Athenis the gud tovne, Alexander callit be name, A noble clerk and of gud fame, In Rome fully nyne ?ere Twa monethis and foure dais cleire Wes paip maid and held þat se, And of Sanct Petyre first maid he A memor and of other ma, Off bischopis [in] his tyme alsua, And placis faire of gret honoure He ordanit for thare sepulture. Till all Cristin he prechit, And thraly with his lettres techit That befor all vthere thai Suld honour preistis be alway, For, he said, sen thai specialy Vsit to God to sacrify, For þat causs thai suld with þaim tak Maire deuotly for Goddis saik. He ordanit clerkis, with honour, To schaif thare berd and mak tonsure. And eftir him, quhen he wes deid, ?achary sat in his steid Ten ?eris and monethis sevin, And twa dais to rekin evin. To thire twa papis Schir Traiane Wes emperour contemporane, And nyntene ?eris of þe empyre Lestit lord, emperour and syre. All Asy, Babulone and Perse, And Inde als, as I herd reherse, He oure raid and wan of weire, And maid to Rome tributere. He gert als within þe Reid Se A gret navyne gaderit be, Of Inde the merchis to distroy, The folkis of þat land to noye. Of þe empyre the boundis braid Swa in till his tyme he maid Till all the Orient maid homage To Rome and payit thare trewage. Men vsit for his worschip ay In commone proverb for to say, Quha happyare þan Octoviane, Or quha euer better þan Traiane? He wes als sa liberall, Sa luffand and sa speciall, That about fer or neire, Quhether sa haill or seik thai ware, That in proper persone he Wes passand, there necessite He wald visit and amend, Apone thaim his gud dispend. Be thra counsall and felloune He maid gret persecutioune Off Cristin men, bot ?it he wes Commendit of gret rychtuisnes. The story sayis that in þat tyde That he wes bovne in weire to ryde, His fut he had in sterap set, One steid he lap, but langere let; Rycht by the fut a wif him gat, And kenely carpit efter þat: “Now,” scho said, “schir emperour, Thow liffis in riches and honour, Weldand warldis welth at will, And I anoyit in angris ill, And ledis my lif but help of the, That dettit is to succour me. The comfort of my caire, my sone, Agane the law to dede is done; Now, for the beild of thi honour, Thow do me law, schir emperour, Off thame þat that innocent Has done to deid but iugisment.” Till hir he ansuerd and said: “Dame, Als sone efter as I cum hame, For thi sone I sall ger do That at law wald were done thareto.” “Schere emperour,” þan said this wif, “Off thi ganecome with thi lif Art þov sicker, or quhilk is he That borgh tharefor will to me be?” “Dame,” þan said the emperour, “Seik þan to my successour, And for þi sone I trow he will Of his det the law fulfill.” This wif ansuerd him agane And said: “Schir emperour, I bid nocht layne, Of thi successour þe deid May nouther the mend na thi meid, And tharefor,” said scho, “schir emperour, Thow art of law to me dettour, And gif that thi successour will His awne det in his tyme fulfill, ?it seker thare of may þov nocht be; Quhy suld þov set him þan to me? And his awne dettis for to qwite May nocht mend thi meid a myte.” Out of his sterap he with that Drew his fut and doune he sat, And did full law and iugisment Off þaim þat slew þat innocent. It fell alsua ane other tyme His sone and aire did a fell cryme, Quharfor of law he suld haif bene Deprivit thare of baith his ene; Than fra his sone he gert be tane Out of his hede of his ene ane, And of his awne heid þan gert he Rycht thare be tane ane vther e, And, for to fulfill the law sua, Tynt and haldin wer eyne twa. In till his tyme Schir Placidas, That callit wes efter Schir Eustas, For worschip prince wes, ane chiftane Oure his knichtis euerilkane. The clerk Planyus in his dayis Wrait till him, þe story sais, That Cristin men on nakyne wise Suld he dishess nor suppriss, For in þaim, said he, wes nane ill, Na he couþ neuer fynd thare will For to mak ony sacrifice, Na [do] honour on ony wiss To mawmentis; bot þare vse is ay To ryss vp oft befor þe day And to thare Crist full deuotly, He said, thai maid þare sacrify, And haldis him God, and in him trowis, Na for na panys fra him bowis. Fra þin he sessit for to weide Aganis Cristin men in deid, Bot throu his persecutioun Mony sufferit the passioun Off dede, and tholit mertery, Throu fell counsall and tyrandry, Befor þat Planyus till him wrait, And commandit the Cristin stait. This ilk emperour Schir Traiane Tuke þe trewage of Brettane, And in his dayis Duchill raiss, And king attour þe Pightis was Within þe kinrik of Scotland, And xx. winter wes regnand. And quhen that Schir Traiane wes deid Schire Adriane raiss in his steid, And wes to Cristin men felloune, And on þaim maid persecutioun. Befor Traiane sa douchty wes That be way of his rychttuisnes Sanct Gregoure with gret deuotioun Maid for him speciall orisoune To God to ger his saull to be Out of hell deliuerit fre; And efter thra prayeris he gat Full wittering of the angell of that, That God had herd his orisoune, And at his supplicatioun Traianyis saull wes out of hell, Quhare it wes ordanit for to duell. Bot ?it fra thi Sanct Gregour ay Had a gret seiknes mony day For his vnskilfull asking, And lestit ay till his ending. For quhy þe angell bad him chese Outhire Traianys saull to leise, Or ellis to tak him a seiknes, Sen his asking vnskilfull wes; And þe feueris till him tuke he, And sa he brocht þe saull to gle; And this efter v. hundreth ?ere That Schir Traiane wes brocht on beire; And the causs of þis pete was For he herd of his rychttuisnes, And of his lif, and of his deid, For he thret wes, as we reid, Be cruell counsall and felloune, To mak sic persecutioun Off Cristin men, and nocht of will. This gert Sanct Gregour tak him till That seiknes, and brocht his saull to bliss, Quhare now he and he baith is. CHAPTER LXXX. Off the emperour Schir Adryane And of Antone the myld as ane. A hundreth and xxii. ?ere Efter þe byrth of our Lord deire, Alexander, paip of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome, Five monethis and viii. ?ere And twa dais als, to rekin cleire, In till the papis segis sat; Bot syne it waikit efter that Fully five and thretty dais. He ordanit, as Frere Martyne sais, Watter and salt till hallowit be; Haly watter sa fyrst maid he With effectuouse orisonis Agane all euill temptationis. And syne he bad efter als fast The haly watter in houssis cast, And at haly watter ay Suld be maid ilk Sonday. In to the mess he ordanit syne The watter suld be put in wyne; The breid als that vsit suld be Round, of litill quantite, And bot of floure and watter cleire, And but ony vthere matere, He ordanit þan, and efter his day That haly kirk hes vsit ay. And syne in till the cannone he Maid of the mess Qui pridie, That ?it is vsit to be said Quhen þe chesabill is vplaid Befor the eleuatioun, Syne makis the consecratioun. This emperour Schir Adryane Gert this pape Alexander be tane, And presonyt him in pyt to pyne; Throu mertyrdome he slew him syne. And thus quhen Alexander wes dede, The pape Sixt sat in his steid Ten ?eris and monethis thre, And ane and twenty dais fre. Bot or that Alexander wes pape, Or of Rome wes maid bischape, This emperour Schir Adriane Off the empire the stait had tane, And liffit in eise and honour Ane and twenty ?eris emperoure. Ierusalem in his tyme gert he Weill agane vpbiggit be, Bot the Iowis he held ay In subiectioun till his end day. He wes avenand man and abill, And in all haiffingis honorabill, And maid lawis imperiall, And wes waill wyss in gouernall. A gret pyllare he gert be maid In Rome, and thereon his name maid. To þe emperour Schir Traiane Nixt nychtboure wes Adriane; At Traiane ay he had invy That he wes luffit sa specially; For þat invy [gret] landis seire, That to the empyre wonnyng were, As Babulone and Ermeny, And all the landis of Surry, Throu vertu and wit of Traiane, This emperour Schir Adriane Leiffit, and swa set him sone For all Denmerk till haue done; Na were his counsall maid him let And him on vthire purposs set. All þe tyme of his empyre, That he of Rome wes lord and syre, And liffit in quyet and in pess, And weill letterit man he wes; Baith of Latyne and of Grew He wes weill langagit, and in Hebrew. He mony rychtwiss lawis maid, And in Athenis ordanit he had Off full faire werk a gret librare; He bad at nane sa hardy ware Cristin men for to suppriss, Or þame to cryme on ony wyss, Bot gif þat pruf agane þaim maid, And þe law þaim convickit had. The kirk in his tyme Orientall The oiss of seruice changeit haill Into the langage than of Grew, Out of the langage of Hebrew. Sanct Ierome and vthere doctouris syne Translatit it in to Latyne. He ekit gretly þe tresoure, And held his knychtis in honour; Off Ierusalem quhen he Had all biggit the cete, He gert oure all that steid Quhare Crist tholit passioun of deid, And Cristin men ay levit he Within that steid to haif entre; Bot he wald grant on nakyne wiss To the Iowis þat franchis. Quhen his barnage come him till, And said him that it wes thare will, And gaif him for full counsall all Cesare August his sone to call, He said it mycht suffice þat he Him self þat stude in that degre, And but dissert regnyt emperour, Thocht þat stait and that honour Wer nocht spilt in sic ane vthere, Quhether þat he were sone or broþer. Thare suld na stait succeid be blude, Bot thare were vnder vertew gud; A lord borne without merit, He said, is nocht worth a myte; A king of byrth and vnworthy Regnys, he said, vnhappely; The fader, he said, he couth weill pruf, Dispol?eis þe sone of fader luf, Mare chargis on his bak to lay Than he may meitly beire away; For sa he settis his besynes To smore his sone be lyklynes, And vnder birth him to suppriss, But help of him with it to ryss. For thy suld men in þare ?outhheid Be techit weill to pruf in deid, And follow the effect of thare lard Quham in þai saw vertu in ward; And gif thai grew sa in valew Throu wit, worschip and vertew, That thai were like þaim to exceid, That thai in honoure wald preceid, Than suld þai clyne as thai were cald, And stedfastly thare steppis [hald] In to þat hicht quhill thai were set, That thai þame presit befor to get, Than regne and rewill thare rialte With luf and larges, and leill lawte. Quhillis Schir Adriane regnit thus, The philosophour Secundus Wes in his flouris and his stait; Bot his sentens all he wrait, For strait silens he held ay; The causs thareof I bid nocht say, For ?e may fynd in his buke, Gif ?e will in his tretiss luke. In till his tyme, as I herd tell, Oure the Pightis Wordegell Raiss, and king wes of Scotland Twenty winter haill regnand. In till þis Adryanis dais Sext, as þe corniklis sais, Wes pape of Rome, and ordanit ay Sanctus at þe mess to say Forouth þe leuacioun, And efter þe prefacioun. He ordanit als the corporall Off clene lynt to be maid haill, Faire and quhit, foroutin lit, And als þat nane suld handill it, Nor nakyne thing that hallowit ware, As chalis, towell or altare, Bot thai that ministerit it in þat degre, And ordanit ware and had pouste. And efter him, quhen he wes dede, Thelesslour sat in till his steid Thre monethis and xi. ?ere, And xxii. dais neire. He first ordanit to fast ay Sex wolkis haill befor Pasche day, And Gloria in excelsis he Ordanit at the mess to be Said, and on the ?ule day He bad thre messes be said ay: At cokcraw the first mess, For Crist in þat tyme borne wes; The toþer syne ordanit he In the dawing songing to be, For þat tyme Crist in clathis clene Wes sweyllit and with hirdis sene, And worschippit full deuotly, As Luke beris witnes verrayly; Syne the thrid mess of þat day Efter terce he ordanit ay To be songin, quhen at þe licht Off our redemptioun shynit brycht. And efter that Schir Adriane Faire deid deit in Chawmpane, Antone the myld of the empyre Stude emperoure, and lord and syre; Thretty ?eris and monethis thre In to Rome þat stait held he. Mawch he wes till Adriane, And to all Cristin men ilkane He wes rycht mekle and of gud will; Forthy that name wes gevin him till, That myld Antone thai vsit all And thare fader him to call. And als in his tyme landis seire, That oblist to gret dettis were, Off þare dettis he maid þaim fre, Bot þare homage ay still held he. The medicynare, Galiene be name, In his tyme wes of gret fame, And Tholonus in astronomy Wes þan commendit gretumly. And þat tyme alsua Pompeyus, That be name wes callit Trogus, A speciall kynd of natioune, Commendit wes of gret renovne; Off all the warld þan þe storyis Fra Nynus king begouth to ryse Till þat tyme of Octoviane All þe warld to þe empyre wan, This Pompeyus in Latyne Cornykillit, and devisit syne That in fourty bukis and foure; There efter Iustyne, þat red þaim oure, Abregit all þai gret storyis In smallare and in gret tretiss. This myld Antone vsit to say That him had fere levere alway A man of his to saue vnslane Than of his fais to sla agane For a man a thousand haill, How euer þe vre ?eid of batall. Antone þe myld, the emperour, All tyme to gud men did honour, He had a dochter hecht Faustyne, Faire of face, and fassone fyne; In till hir play anis scho past, Scho saw quhare men wer fechtand fast; One ane of þaim scho set hir luf, For manhud at scho saw him prufe, And brint in luf sa straitly That seik baith scho wes and sary, And in poynt for to beyne dede, Bot scho had soner gottin remeid. Hir husband forthy fra Calde Gert medycenaris fechit be, To se and wit quhat malady Travalit his wif full fellonly. Quhen þai come and had sene hir weill, And scho had tald þaim euerilk deill The manere of hir malady, Thai gaif hir counsall halely The man at sa his manheid pruffit, And at scho sa straitly luffit, To be slane, and syne his blude In till a weschall tycht and gud Suld be put syne haistely, And wesche tharwith oure hir body With þat blude till it were hait. And sa þai did without debait, And quhen þai had on þat wiss done Hir temptatioun cessit sone, And scho couerit of hir malady, And left hir foly fantasy. Bot methink heire wes litill skill, That þai suld for hir wanton will Sla a saikles man but law. There wes of God bot litill aw, For, gif ony suld haif bene slane, It suld haif bene scho in certane, Erare þan he þat maid na causs; Bot it is said in commone sawis That mastry mawis þe medow doune ay, And sa fell heire, þe suth to say. All þis tyme in to Scotland Attour þe Pightis wes regnand Derwolkchet, oure þaim king Fourty winter, but lesing. In this tyme Thelesflorus The pape deit, and Ygynyus Four ?eris and monethis thre In Rome he held the papis se. He maid and ordanit the clergy Discrivit be greis properly. The god fader he bad alsua, Or the god moder, barnis to ta Off the fount quhen thai hovin were. He ordanit alsua þat manere Quhen barnys suld confermyt be. And syne in generall letter he Off God and manis vnyoune In Cristis incarnatioun He wrait to be haldin ay, But ony dout, of Cristin fay. CHAPTER LXXXI. How Pasche day wes ordanit to be One the Sonday solempnyte. Till the pape Ygynyus Nixt succedit Schir Pyus; Xi. ?eris and monethis foure, And xxi. dais oure, Paip of Rome he verray was. In his letteris he said Hermes, A doctour gret of Cristin fay, That weill wes letterit in his day, Said þat ane angell brycht and quhit, In till a hirdis price habit, Apperit and gaif bidding ay Pasche to mak apon Sonday; Forthy, of oure auctorite, We appruf that solempnyte Ilk ?ere to be done ay, As courss rynnis, on þe Sonday. CHAPTER LXXXII. Off Marcus Antonyus And of his broþer Aurelyus. Marcus than Antonyus, And his broþer Aurelyus, Emperouris and lordis were Off þe empyre xix. ?ere; And of Rome the empyre swa Wes devisit betuix þaim twa, Bot quhen Aurelyus the dede had tane, Marcus Antonyus him allane Held and gouernyt þe empyre. All Asy oure fra Tarss to Tyre, Inde and all þe Orient, And gret part of þe Occident, He gert pay contributioun. Bot mony tholit the passioun Off martyrdome for Cristin fay Wndyre [him]; ?it wes he ay Off gret wit and stabilnes, For nane mycht ken þat euer he wes, For ony word or causs hapnyng, Changeit in his assembling. With mesour and benignyte All his landis tretit he; And all tyme commendit wes Off worschip, honour, and larges. His tresoure quhen he dispendit had, His weschall, þat of gold wes maid, And all his wiffis heid geire haill, With mony vther faire jowell, He gaif his knychtis in þare fe, In defalt of oþer money; Na his commonis on na wiss With taxt na tollis he nane wald supprise, Bot mare his will wes to releif Thame þan with sic thingis greif. Off realmes and cuntreis syne sindry Off quhilkis he wan þe victory, He recouerit wonder weill All his distres euerilk deill; And mony landis þat þan wer Subiect to Rome and tributer, He relevit þare trewage, Reservand till him þare homage. Combest, as our story sayis, Oure þe Pightis in his dais Wes fourty winter king regnand Within the kinrik of Scotland. In his tyme Pyus the pape wes deid, And Anyane raiss in his steid, Nyne ?eris and monethis thre, And fully four dais held þat se. Sothere syne his successour Nyne ?ere and thre monethis oure, And ane and xx. dais fre Sat in to the papis se.

CHAPTER LXXXIII. Quhat tyme Brettane tuke Cristindome Throu Eleutherius, pape of Rome. A hundreth and four score of ?ere And fully five, or þarby neire, Quhen þat Sothir þe paip wes deid Elutherius tuke his steid, And sat in till it xv. ?ere Sex moneth and sevin dais cleire. The king of Brettane Lucyus Wrait till Elutherius, And maid him instance specially To send in till Brettane in hy Off his clerkis for to preche The Cristin treuth, and for to teche To tak bapteme, for nane may But it be sauf on ony way; And on þis manere and þis caiss Brettane first conuertit wes, And all þe barnage of that land Than baptist wer and weill trowand, And stedfast stude in to þat fay Till Dioclesianis day; And þat is, gif the sovme be sene, A hundreth winter and sextene, Or nere tharby, as sum men wrait, And varyiss as þai set the dait. Xxviii. bischopis þan Were of ydolis in Brettane, And thre archbischopis als Were þat tyme of ydolis fals; The bischopis þai callit Flamynes, And þe archibischopis callit wes Archiflamynes, and syne thareft In to the steid of þaim wes left Bischopis, quhare that Flamynes, And archbischopis quhare gretare wes. Off that papis auctorite He gert Schir Lucyus hovin be; This paip als Eleutherius Brettane to the trewth wan þus. He ordanit als at nane suld be But challange put out of his gre, For Crist, he said, wist weill Iudas Baith a theif and a tratour was, Bot, for he wes nocht of sic thing Accusit of law ?it of tholing, He wes nocht put fra his office, Bott bydand did furþ his seruice Amangis þe appostles, and quhat at he Did with þame for þare dignite Ferme and stable it wes left, And appruffit weill þareft. CHAPTER LXXXIV. Off ane woman wes maid abbat And defamyt throu ane ald trat. In to Rome Schir Comodus, The sone of Marche Antonyus, That tyme wes maid emperoure, And xiii. ?ere in that honour He stude, and wes in dedis fell Ouctrage and rycht cruell. Off Ducheland ?it halely He wan and had þe wictory, And held it subiect all his dais. In Egipt syne, the story sais, He send of Rome a Ducheman, That be name hecht Phillip þan, Chiftane vnder him to be Off Alexander þe gret cete. This Phillip had a douchter faire, That suld of law haif bene his aire, Bot, for luf of the Cristin fay, Scho fra hir fader stall away, And tuke with hir in cumpany Twa geldit men and of gud fame, That Prothy and Iacmit had to name. Scho bapteme tuke in prevate, And held hir madin ay secre, And Eugynyus callit hir name, Commendit of rycht honest fame, And leit ay at scho wes man. Scho and þir twa geldit þan, That for þe faiþ wes geldit sa, As haly kirk can memor ma, Thir thre conuersit togidder ay, And had repaire till ane abbay, And þare of thare deuocioun Tuke habit of religioun, And leiffit þare religiously, And did þare seruice perfitly. Sa sone þe abbot of þat place Deit and sone beryit was, And þis Eugenyus in his steid Wes chosyn quhen he wes deid. A woman þan of wickit fame, That Malicia hecht be name; Hir name accordit till hir deid, As be the Latyne in oure leid. This woman wonnyt neire this abbay, And reparit till it ilk day, And throu that repaire þat scho had, And saw þis abbot newlingis maid, Scho luffit him sa inkyrly That scho ?arnyt of him cumpany. Bot quhen scho saw scho mycht not get His assent þar to, but let, Than scho defamit him alhaill, And till his monkis tald be taill How þat he wald haue lying hir by, And supprisit hir violently, Na were þat pigh scho put agane, And helpit hir selfin sa wiþ mayne. And quhen þis wif had warpit þus Off this abbot Eugenyus, To heire his accusatioun Befor þe provest of the tovne He wes harlit be how and haire, Till all his clathis revin ware. Sa in þat tul?e as thai hir tyt, It wes persauit throu a slyt That scho wes woman verraly; And þare the provest properly, That beheld and saw this cass, And kend that scho his dochter wes, Lovit God, syne hovyne wes he With all his court and his men?e; And this wickit wif and welance, Throu a sodane and fell wengeance, Off fyrflacht in to þat steid Perist but ony kyne remeid. CHAPTER LXXXV. Off sindry papis successive And of seire emperouris in thare live. Qwhen Eleutherius wes deid Victor sat in till his steid Twa monethis and x. ?ere, And twelf dais passit cleire. A gret counsall he gert be Haldin with solempnyte; Thare stablist wes at Pasche suld ay Be haldin apone þe Sonday, For mony bischopis of Asy And all þe Est part halely Wsit ilk ?ere þare Pasche As þan the Iowis maner was. Gif ony man in dout were stad, And neid of help or mister had, And ?arnyt in þat poynt to be Cristin man, þan ordanit he That man hovin to be rycht þare, In quhat kin plyte at euer he ware. Quhen þis Victor paip wes þus, The emperour raiss Elyus; Till ilk man in his degre Myld and compynable wes he. Bot within þe first ?ere Off his empyre, withoutin were, Throu caiss he wes slane and deid. Than raiss Seuerus in his steid, And sevin ?ere of þe empyre He wes emperour, lord and syre, And preffit full gret douchtynes, And as weill letterit man he wes; Bot he wes cruell and felloune, And maid gret persecutioun Off Cristin men, þat mony ?ere Deid throu him wiþ tormentis seire. He facht with sindry nationis, And wan, and maid þar regionis To Rome subiect, and Brettane Off þai þe last wes at he wan, And þare he maid within þat ile A waill lang of a hundreth myle With xxx. myle þarto and thre, Strekand evin fra se to se, And in to takin þat he wan Off weire þe kinrik of Brettane. In till ?ork syne wes he dede, And Caracalla in his steid Sevin ?eris wes emperour, Bot lust supprisit his honour; Seuerus sone he wes but dout, Bot he wes ware þan he all out; In all poynt of lichory He liffit þarin bernandly; His awne stepmoder till his wif He tuke, and with hir led his lif. Zepherus syne paip of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome, And succedit nixt Victor, Off quham ?e herd reherss befor, And þat se held monethis sevin, And twa dais and ?eris ellevin. He ordanit þat euerilk ?ere That all þat of eild passit were Twelf winter suld be clenely Schrevin, and tak efter deuotly The sacrament at Pasche, I wiss, That veraly Goddis body is. And quhen this ?epherus wes deid, The pape Calixt sat in his steid Five ?eris and monethis twa, And x. dais withoutin ma. This pape Calixt in his dais Ordanit, as the story sais, The Katertens in deire fasting. Syne, quhen his dais tuke ending, Till him succedit nixt Vrbane, That wes of natioun a Romane; Threttene winter and ellevin Monethis and xii. dais evin In Rome he held þe papis se. Waleriane conuertit he, That spousit wes wiþ sanct Cecile; And vnder him to þat quhile The kirk raiss till possessionis And rentis of gret regionis, That before his tyme alway Lyfit on teyndis or monay That wes gevin in offerand, Be vse or statut of the land. To paip Calixt and Vrbane Thre emperouris contemporane Wes in þare tyme successive, And ilk ane felloune in þar live. Off þai þe first wes callit Martyne, He bot a ?ere stude; nixt him syne Antonyus wes emperour, And thre ?eris stude in þat honour; His body brint sa in delite Off foull lust and foull appetite That alkyne kynd of lichory He vsit als commonly As he a best but wit had bene. Nixt efter him, withoutin weyne, Alexander, his successour, Wes xxx. winter emperour, And þat tyme Orygynis The doctour in his flouris wes, And Carametryte in Scotland Twenty winter king regnand Wes oure the Pighis in þai dais, As oure Scottis storyis sais. This tyme alsua till Vrbane The pape succedit Potiane, That twa monethis and v. ?ere And twa dais þarto, but weire, In Rome held the papis se. In Sardonya deit he, And Serak, his successour, Held bot a ?ere þat honour, For he chesit of deuotioun Ane here, and of natioun A Greke, and gert sit in that se; In cumpany syne passit he With the xii. thousand virginis clene That baptist befor þat had bene To Culane fra the court of Rome, And with þaim tholit martyrdome. Bot, for causs at his clergy Wend for lust of his body That he had with þai madinis gane, Reknyt he wes nocht as ane Off the papis quhare thai ar set. Anchores efter him, but let, Ordanit bischopis for to be Transferrit for causs fra se to se. To thir papis contemporane Thre ?eris first Maximiane Stude emperour, and quhen he deit Gordiane till him succedit, And sex ?eris in þe empyre Stude emperour and lord and syre. Quhen Fabiane wes paip of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome, Nixt till Anchores successour, And xiii. ?eris in þat honour He sat, and ordanit cremys ay To be maid on Skirs Thursday. Quhen the congregatioun Sat in þare electioun, And Fabiane amang þaim þare, A quhit dow on his heid all baire Lichtit, and said he suld be paip, And of the warld þe mast bischap; Throu electioun in þat place Pape of Rome he chosin was. CHAPTER LXXXVI. Off þe first emperour þat tuke Cristindome as sais þe buke. Twa hundreth winter and fourty And sex passit oure fullely Efter þe Incarnatioun That causit oure saluatioun, The emperour Gordiane þan deid, Phillip raiss in till his steid, Off Rome lord and emperour. And till he wes in that honour He maid his sone [persenar] Off all þe empyre, and sevin ?ere Thai twa gouernyt halely Off þe empyre þe sen?eory, And baith Phillip were þai cald; Bot, as I fynd, Phillip þe ald Wes þe first emperoure þat tuke Cristindome, as sais þe buke; And how þat fell first ?e sall heire, As I fynd writtin, þe manere. In Rome sumtyme a senatour, Callit Marcus, in gret honour Luffit and spousit a lady That be name wes callit Iuly. Togidder lang þai led þar live In rest and eise, foroutin strive, And luffit rychtuisnes alway, And trew and stedfast in þar fay. And sa betuix þaim twa of caiss Gret wamyt wiþ child þis lady wes, And, or hir tyme wes cumand neire, Scho vsit fasting and prayere, As women in sic perell stad Oft syss for þare lif ar rad, And hechtis and wowis mare Than oft to qwit of will þai ar. This lady mowit gret pilgrymage, And tuke furth þare on hir vyage, And visyte hir goddis, ane and ane, And socht þe tempillis euerilkane. Sua, in þe temple of Iupiter As scho wes mankand hir prayere, The preist, revestit on his wiss For to resaue hir sacrifiss, Fra þat he sene had þis lady Changeit he wes sodanely, And worthit out of wit sa wod That all ferlyit þat by him stude. For he tuggit with his teith in taggis His westment and raif all in raggis; With þat þai þat stude him by Tuke and held him stalwartly, And baire him bakwartis to the erd. Bot ay with voce rudly he rerd, But wit wedand as a wod man, And ay his commone word wes þan Amang þaim in to þat strif: “Out! out apon ?one wickit wif! Hir byrth sall brew ws mekle baill; How fell þat in the dismaill Scho hes consauit,” he said, “of man A child betuix hir sydis þan; And I waitt weill, þis I ?ow warne, In till hir wambe now is a barne That sall ger our goddis all Be brokin in to pecis small, And all the tempillis castin doune, And fordo all our regioun. In me,” he said, “þe spirit wycht Off our goddis mekle of mycht Gerris me speik þis I prophasy, That ?e sall fynd full sekirly.” Bot þis wes nocht þat spirit brycht, In toungis of fyre leuand as lycht, That, birnyng apon Witsonday, Inspyrit the Appostlis, sa þat þai Spak opinly in all langage, Quhare throu all nationis had knawlege Off haly Scripture, quhen þat þai Prechit haly kirkis fay. Bot this spirit that spak in [the breist], As ?e herd, of this wod preist, Wes of the deuill, withoutin dreid, And of Goddis tholyne worthit of neid But certane thing of wit to tell That efter in deid rycht sa befell. For God has till him reseruit all The wit of þat at is to fall; Sa is it Goddis properte To knaw all thingis or thai be. Sa of his creaturis þar is nane That can tell þarof þe certane, Bot of his tholing quham to he will, Quhen he thinkis it is tyme or skill, Bot quhill the spirit is sa Travalit that he mon ansuere ma, And his ansuere is ay doutwiss, And his conclusioun peralouss. The preist fure þus lang and fast, And þis lady at þe last, That beheld and saw þis caiss, Effrayit out of mesoure wes. Wp scho raiss þan full gud speid, And of the temple gretand ?eid, And enterit in a houss neire by The temple, sorowfull and sary. Thare quhile scho swovnyt, and quhille scho suet, Quhile held hir still, and quhile scho gret, And quhile till hard and hevy stanis Scho brissit hir selfin for þe nanys, And ay said allace! allace! That euer scho borne or gottin wes That byrth to beire, þat suld ger all Thare tempillis and þare goddis fall; And schupe gif scho had had a knyf Scho suld haif lossit thare batheris lif; Thus schupe scho in that aduenture, Had nocht bene þat þis senatour Marcus, hir lord, þat saw hir sa; In hert þarfor he wes full wa, And quhilis he chastyit hir with manas, And quhilis he comfort hir with solace. For at hir tyme scho wes full neire Quhen scho maid all this bailfull beire, And sone wes lichtare of a sone, The quhilk to dede scho wald haif done Had nocht the fader bene nere by, That snybbit hir rycht fellonly, And bad hir of hir byrth forbeire, And byde and se gif Iupiter Wald revenge him of his will, Sen he of mycht wes large thartill. “The barne forthy þov suld nocht sla, Sen he will, and he be his fa, Tak wengeance of him at his will; Forthy þov do him now nane ill.” The child thai gert þan tenderly Be fosterit, quhill þare wes gane by Off his eild fully vii. ?ere; And than on buke thai gert him leire His informatioun, quhill he couth weill, And syne his gramer ilk [deill]; Bot ?it his fader gert him ay Draw fra Cristin men alway, In that entent at þat destynee Off þare goddis suld brokin be. Apone a day, ?it neuerþeles, As he to scule gangand wes, By a chapell he come neire, Quhare Cristin freris singand were, And þe psalme þat I herd tell Wes In exitu Israell; And, as the story mais reherss, Thai were singand þis ilk verss: Deus autem noster in celo omnia quecunque voluit fecit. Simulachra gentium argentum et aurum, opera Manuum hominum. Os habent et non loquentur, Oculos habent et non videbunt, Neque enim est spiritus in ore ipsorum. This is in our langage to say: “Our God, forsuth, in hevin is ay, And all thingis as he said has wrocht; And all mawmentis of folkis ar nocht Bot siluer and gold, and maid throu man.” Gret thocht of this the child had tane, And sone efter that nocht lang, In to thai freris as he couth gang, He herd þaim sing ane other verse, And þis is it for to reherss: Quoniam omnes dii gentium demonia, Dominus autem celos fecit. And this in Inglis is to say: “All goddis of folkis ar feyndis verray, Thare is na God bot ane in hycht, That maid the hevin throu his mycht.” This barne thocht euer on þir verse, And ay of thaim he maid reherse. And to the chapell oft forthy He went, and drew in cumpany To þame þat þir verses sang, And oft conuersit þame amang, Sa þat of þe pape Pontiane Haly bapteme he has tane, And callit was be name Pontius. And quhen þat he wes hovin þus, And quhen þat he had prevely þus done, At certane tyme he sped him sone, Off his changeying glaid and fayne, Till his fader hame agane; And sone efter he met samyn, And spokin togidder of sum gamyn; The fader sperit at the sone In to the scoill quhat he had done, Sen þe tyme befor þan last That he had fra his fader past, And maid examinatioun Off his leire and his lessoune. Than said þe child: “My fader deire, Sen þe tyme þat I wes heire, A better lessoune neuer wes red Than I herd in a preve sted.” The fader askit him quhat it wes, And þe child him tald but less; And thare, throu wiss argument, He drew alhaill his faderis entent Haly bapteme for to ta. Than baith togidder can þai ga To þe haly pape Pontiane, And haly bapteme has of him tane; And als fast fra þat wes done, In hy, with Pontius his sone, This Marcus in the temple past, And brak all þar mawmentis fast, And worschippit Crist, þar creature, And did him seruice and honour. Sa fell it efter mony day, Quhen þis Marcus wes ded away, That þis child wes tane o threte, For honour of his lynage grete, And present to þe emperoure, That held him in to gret honour Off stait and of gret sen?eory, As fell till him of ancestry. Sa quhen the emperour herd tell That Frans raiss agane Rome rebell, Out of his court he send a knycht, Schir Dycius to name he hycht, With a huge oste as man of weire, France to dant with þat powere. And quhen þis Dycius fure in Frans For till ameiss þare þis distans, Rynnand wes þe thousand ?ere, As reknyt wes and comptit cleire, Fra Romanis gert wallit be, As ?e herd, of Rome þe cete; And for þat causs þe Romanis haill All that ?ere held festiuall, In turnamentis and in iusting, In menstraly and in playing; And euerilk day apon þar wiss Did to þar goddis sacrifiss, Syne went to solace and to play. And sa þe emperour on a day Ordanit him on his best wiss To pas and mak his sacrifiss To Iowis his god deuotly; Sa tuke he in his cumpany Pontius the child, at wes Gruchand in that way to pass; Bot be the way sa quhen that he Saw his oportunyte, He said: “Me think, Schir Emperour, This seruice to ?our Creatour ?e aw of det for to dispend, That has ?ow all þis honour send.” “Sone,” he said, “tharfor I ga Now [to] the tempill for to ma To Iouis þare my sacrifice, As is my det, on my wiss; For he is þat God of mycht That has me helpit to þis hycht.” Than said þe child: “Schir Emperour, ?e are implyit in fals errour, ?our mychti makare for to forsaik, And till a deuill ?our seruice mak. ?one mawment, callit Iupiter, Or Iouis or Mars, baith is wer; Thai ar na goddis, bot deuillis thre, That can noþer speik, na heire, na se, Set þai haif mouth, eris and ene, Handis and feit, wit ?e but weyne, Thai haif nane of þe wittis five; Thai ar bot lumpis withoutin live, Baith dwm and deiff, and dull and daft, And mortall maid throu manis craft, And deuillis within þaim þat spekis, Thame to dissaue þat to þame rekis.” “Quhilk, sone,” said the emperour, Suld I þan call my Creature?” “Schir,” said þe child, “he that ?ow wrocht, And all þat is has maid of nocht; That borne wes of þe madin chaist, Consauit throu the Haly Gaist, And syne oure redemptioun Throu vertu of the passioun.” Than throu þir wordis, and oþer ma, The emperour, and his sone alsua, Past to the pape Sanct Fabiane, And of him than has bapteme tane, And Phillip callit were þai twa, The fader and þe sone alsua. In haist togidder þan als fast To þe temple baith þai past, And þare þir ydolis, ane and all, Thai tuke and brak in pecis small; And þe destynee wes weill Thare fulfillit þan ilka deill, That þe wod preist on fors said, Quhen he wes brawland in his braid. Sa stedfast syne in Cristin fay Thai were, þat on þe Pasche day The fader and þe sone alsua Passit to þe kirk to ta Thare howsill amang þe Cristin men, And þe haly paip Fabien, That herd þare confessioun, Gert þame with contritioun Do thare pennans outwith þe queire, Quhare þe commonis standand were, Till baith þe seruice and þe mess Wes all done, as þe maner wess; And syne on kneis deuotly þai Goddis body tuke verray. Thus Phillip, emperour of Rome, Wes þe first tuke Cristindome. Dycius this tyme wes in France, And amesit þe gret distance, And wane þare thar subiectioun, And tuke þare contributioun, And resauit þare homage, And of þe gretest tuke ostage, And gert þaim seill þar ragman weill Off all þir poynttis ilkedeill. In all þat weire he wes sa wiss That worschip gret he wan and priss; Bot pompouss, hawtane and hie of [feire], He past all mesoure and manere, And sa with gret pryde and deray Fra France to Rome he tuke þe way; And Phillip þan, þe emperour, In entent to eik his honour, His stait, his worschip, his men?e, Arrayit him with gret ryalte, And all his barnage halely, For till haif met him ryally; And on that purpose past onone Neire till a cete callit Werone, And quhen he herd þare þat his knycht, Schir Dycius, had for þat a nycht Within the tovne tane his herbery, For dreid of ryot or revery, And at þar meting first suld be Sene with all þe commonyte, In opin place with sic honour As ordanit has þe emperour, In till þe feild without þe tovne Gert distent his pavil?eoune, And all þe lordis þat by ware Come till him of duelling þare, And as þai were of stait and gre Neire him he gert herbryit be, And gat þaim vittaill of þe land, To leif þe tovne maire haboundand, That to þis knycht na thing suld faill, That had tane for him sic travaill. Bot this Dycius þat ilk nycht Anarmyt him rycht sone, I hecht, And prevely out of þe tovne He past on to þe pavil?eoune Quhare þe emperour in lay, And slew him lang or it wes day; Syne to þe pavil?eons ilk ane He past and tuke vp ane and ane Of the lordis þare as þai Slepand in þair beddis lay, And sum with tretiss, and sum wiþ aw, He gert þaim till him heild and draw. To Rome þan he past in by, With all þai in his cumpany; And quhen at þe Romanis herd tell Off þat caiss how it befell, Than þai begouth on þare best wiss Agane þis Dycius haill to ryss, And quhen he saw þaim busk þaim sa, This wes þe ansuere he can ma, And said þat slauchter he awowit, And said als he suld be lowit Be ressone, wit þai, na thai Suld call it murthure be na way For to fordo þe goddis fa, How lychtlyest þai mycht him sla, Sen he wes þe first of Rome Emperour þat tuke Cristindome, Iuge and ensampill agane þar fay, Bot suld be blithare be all way That he to dede wes put sa sone, Or þat þare treuth were all vndone. Than be þis slycht and be þis quayntiss The Romans forbaire for to ryss Aganis him, as þai first thocht; His purpose sa till end he brocht That he wes alhaill emperour, And full twa ?eris in þat honour He stude, cruell and felloune, And maid gret persecutioun Aganis Cristin men alway, And ay at vndyre held þar fay, And mony martyre of þaim maid Quhill he liffit in that haid, And slew þe pape Sanct Fabiane, And þe Sanct als Sebastiane, And vnderneth þat fals coloure He slew the haly emperoure. And quhen Phillip herd be tald That his fader Phillip þe ald Wes þus gatis slane, away he stall, And commendit his tresoure all To Sanct Sixt, þat þan bischap Wes of Rome, and efter maid paip. This ?oung Phillip wes sa lourd That men mycht neuer, for na bourd, In na steid na in na quhile, Ger him nouþer lawch nor smyle. This Sanct Sixt I spak of aire Till auld Phillip wes tresorare, And ?oung Phillip his sone forthy, Quhen he away past prevely, Left with þis Sixt þe tresore That I maid mentioun of befor, And in till Sixtis passioun Sanct Laurens maid þan mentioun Off þe tresoure, as I kend, And writtin is in his legend. Quhen Fabiane þe pape wes dede, Cornelyus sat in his steid Thre ?eris and monethis twa, And fully xi. dais alsua, Syne wes he slane with Dycius. Till him succedit Lucyus, That twa ?eris and monethis thre And twa dais held þe papis se. Than Gallus and Voluciane Emperouris were contemporane Twa ?eris and monethis four, And quhen thare dais were all gane oure Dionysius wes maid paip, And of þe warld heid and bischap. He bad at preistis and dekinnis ay Suld nocht in commone vse alway Hallowit vestmentis on þaim beire, As vther clathis þai vse to weire, Bot quhen thai were in þare office, Doand in kirkis þare seruice, And þan þare mess clathis on to be; Off almouss mony dedis did he, And gud werkis sindry and seire, That I may nocht all rekin heire. Throu martyrdome efter he wes Done to dede, singand his mess. Waleriane þan and Galiene In to þe empyre stude fyftene ?eris, and dantit halely Gotland all and gret Asye. With Sapour syne, þe king of Perss, Thai faucht and, as I herd reherss, Thai emperouris baith with þare ost quyte Was in þat batall discomfite, And thare þan wes Valeryane ?olding, and to presoune tane, And set at he wes emperour, Ay schame he tuke and dishonour; For [alway] quhen the king of Perss Wes bovne to ryde, I herd reherss, That emperour þan behuffit of forss Ly evin doune besyde his horss, Law one þe erd, till at þe king Wald clyme on him at his lyking, And on his crag or on his face, All as the will of þat king was, Ay as a fut he wald set, Till that he mycht þe toþer get Esely in his sterope, Quhen he apone his horss wald leip, And thus gatis mekle dishonour Fell to Rome of þat emperour. Bernard Bolghe weill ix. ?ere then Regnyt in Scotland as oure man; Nixt him regnyt Ypopenet, In Scotland held þe kingis set Our þe Pightis xxx. ?ere, Till all þe tymes passit were Off þir papis successive That ?e herd me last discrive, And sex emperouris þan To þir papis contemporane. CHAPTER LXXXVII. Heir it tellis for quhat ressoune Sanct Lowrens tholit passioun. Eftir þe dede of papis sevin Sanct Sixt held þe se thre ?eris evin, Xi. monethis and vi. dayis. Befor þat, as þe story sais, As legait in Span?e he past, And þare þe Cristin treuth he prechit fast, And twa faire ?oung men þare he fand, Honest, abill and avenand; The tane be name wes callit Laurens, And þe toþer wes callit Vincens. Thir twa luffit Sixt specialy, And with him wes contynewaly Till he wes in Span?e prechand. Syne, quhen he turnyt of þat land, For lufrent þai with him past, And come to Rome sa at þe last; And in to Rome Sanct Laurens baid, And with Sanct Sixt his duelling maid, That maid him þan his kepare, And at his liking deliuerare Off all his gud and his tresoure That Phillip emperour that befor Had deluerit quhen he past Out of þe land, as ?e herd last, Fra Dycius cruelte, þat wes fell Till Cristin men, as ?e herd tell. Quhen þis Sixt wes pape of Rome, And kepare haill of Cristindome, He ordanit preistis for to say Thare mess on hallowit altaris ay, That were perfitly maid of stane, Quhare befor his tyme wes nane That sa vsit on to say mess. Throu martyrdome syne slane he was Wnder Dycius ?oung, þat syre That lord wes syne of þe empyre. Efter þat Valeriane And Galiene þe dede had tane, This Dycius ?oung wes rycht felloune, And maid gret persecutioun Apone Cristin folkis alway, And held þaim euer at vnder ay, And mony marteris gert he ma, And þis ilk Sixt wes ane of þai That vnder him tholit martyry. Sanct Laurens, þat wes neire him by, And saw þis persecutioun, And him led till his passioun, Askit him: “Quhether, fader, now Without minister passis þov? Thou wes neuer wont on na wiss To do but minister Goddis seruice. Leif me nocht þarfor, fader deire, Thus anerely behind þe heire; For all thi tresour spendit is, That þov deliuerit me, I wiss.” And Cesar, þis ?oung Dycius, Herd him speik of tresoure thus; He bad Sanct Laurens at he suld bring Furþ þat tresoure but delaying, And Sanct Laurens of dais thre Askit delay, sa þat he Mycht all þat tresour samyn get; And þis ?oung Dycius þan, but let, Thocht till haif gottin all þat tresour, And grantit him delay þarfor. And in þe menetyme Sanct Laurens Gaderit with all deligens Off pure folkis a huge men?e, Waik for eild and febilte, And vther þat in neid were stad, And gret myster of mending had, And closit þaim all prevely In till a house, and syne in hy He ?eid to ?oung Dycius, emperour, And bad him cum and his tresoure Se and resaif, gif that him thocht That it were worþ or ganyt oucht. With þat Dycius went in hy With Sanct Laurens rycht blithly, For till haif gottin þan thocht he Off gold and siluer gret plente. Sanct Laurens þan vndid þe dure, And said: “Lo heire, Schir Emperour, Off the kirk haill the tresour, Quhare of I maid þe hecht befor, That maist may to þi saull availl, And neuer mare forsuth sall faill; This is the trew tresoure, I wiss, That bringis manis saull to bliss.” And quhen þis cursit Dycius Saw he wes begylit thus, He wes sa full of teyne and ire That he gert kyndill a mekle fyre, And þarin rostit Sanct Laurens; With vther tormentis and pennans To Ihesu Crist his saull he send With him to duell withoutin end. This Dycius ?oung þat I spak are, Wes nocht callit August, bot Cesare, And fra þe gud Octoviane All the emperouris ilkane To titill Cesare August had. Bot for þis Dycius had [mad] Off Perss his awne intrusioun, Forthy þe less wes his renovne, For [nouthir be] rycht of lynage, Na ?it be law of heretage, Off Rome he wes maid emperour; Thus for his stait and his honour Wes þe less, baith in his fame And the titill of his name. CHAPTER LXXXVIII. Off sindry papis and emperouris seire And of þare lif now may ?e heire. Dyonyse, till Sixt nixt successour, Sat twa winter in þat honour, Aucht monethis and dais thre. First kirk?ardis ordanit he, And till þe kirk parochis; And ilk preist of his office He ordanit to serve the parochy Till him ordanit distinctly, And hald him of his part content, Vsurpand nocht oure his extent. Felix nixt him sat twa ?ere, And thre monethis tharto cleire; And efter him Euticiane, That wes of natioune a Tuskane, Pape x. monethis and viii. ?ere He wes, and did gud dedis seire. Claudyus and Aurelyane Emperouris were contemporane, Quhen Dionyss and Felix successive Wes ilkane papis in þare live. This Aurelyane in to France Amesit gret weris and distance, And syne vpon þe watter of Laire He foundit a cete gret and faire, And þe name of þat cete Aurelyus efter him callit he, And sa is callit to þis day. And syne, quhen he wes dede away, Tantulyus wes emperoure, And Probus his nixt successour, Floryane, and syne Clarus; Thir vi. emperouris successive thus Regnyt thre and xxx. ?ere; And Faughna þat tyme raise to steire Oure the Pightis in Scotland, And xx. winter wes regnand. Gayus syne wes paip of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome; He ordanit quha þat prest suld be For to be ordanit gre be gre, Crounebennet first, accolit neist, Subdekin, dekin, and syne preist. He ordanit als þat na pagane, Na ?it erratike, nowtherane, Suld challange Cristin men be na way, Nor na sclander on him say, Bot he had cleire euidentis to schaw. He bad alsua þat nane suld draw Befor iugis seculare Persone of kirk, or regulare; And gif þat ony douttis were, Or questionis for to declaire, Thai suld at the papis se Reseruit and declarit be. All þis tyme Dioclesiane, And his fallow Maximiane, Off the empyre xxx. ?ere Wes ane with vther [persenare]. Euill and felloune baith were þai, And held at vnder Cristin fay. Thai gert bryne vp in till a fyre Off dry schydis, bernand schyre, All þe bukis of Cristin law, That techit folkis þe treuth to knaw. This Dioclesiane past of weire Out of Rome with gret powere To þe Orient; thare landis seire He maid to Rome tributere, And all þat trowit in Cristin fay To ded he gert do but delay. Maximiane, his fallow, þan In þe Occident seire landis wan. All France wes þat tyme cruell To Rome, and felloune and rebell; He with his oste throu out it raid, And to Rome it subiect maid; And syne all Ducheland and Spayne, Norway, Denmark and Brettane This Maximiane wan of weire, And dantit haill with his powere. All Ingland, as sais þe buke, Thare Cristindome alhaill forsuke Throu þat persecutioun, That wes sa austerne and felloune, Done throu Dioclesiane And his fallow Maximiane; Sa þat within xxx. dais, As Vincent and Frere Martyne sais, Twa and twenty thousand were Marteris maid in landis seire. Sanct George and Sanct Anastace, Sanct Agnes, Lucye, and Agase, And vther mony marteris seire, That may nocht all be reknyt heire, Off dede tholit the passioun Wndyre þare persecutioun. The pape Gayus martyrdome Tuke, and nixt him pape of Rome Marcellyne sat vii. ?ere, And twa monethis þarto cleire, And xx. dais fully and five. Bot for raddour of his live He maid on the paganis wiss To fals ydolis sacrifiss; Bot syne a solempne sen?e he Gert in Chawmpane gaderit be, I?. bischopis and foure score, Weill revestit him before. With plane and opin confessioun, And with verray contritioun, He iugit him self for to be Deprivit of his dignyte, And cursit all þame þat with honour Suld put his corps to sepultour; For quhy he said þat cuvatise Of stait gert him mak sacrifiss To fals mawmentis, and forthy He wes to preistheid vnworthy. To Dioclesiane syne he past, And confessit him befor him fast That he wes a Cristin man. For þi þat tyrand gert sla him þan, And efter that mony a day Vngraiffin outwith þe erd he lay, Quhill Marcellus the bischap, That efter him wes chosin pape, Throu Sanct Peter, the appostill brycht, Apperith till him on a nycht In visioun, lang forouth day, Quhare slepand in his bed he [lay], And callit him be his name: “Marcell, Gif þov be slepand, þov me tell.” And he ansuerd: “Lord, quhat are ?e In to þis tyme þat callis on me?” “Peter,” he sayis, “is my name, Off þe appostlis for prince tane; Quhy sufferis þov vngravin to be My body abovin erd?” quod he. Than ansuerd þis Marcell, And said: “Lord, I herd tell That pape Cornile my predecessour, That ?it is had in gud memour, At the request of Sanct Lucyne, In till a tombe of merbill fyne Gert thy body beryit be With festyvell solempnyte.” “Nay,” quod Petyr, “Marcellyne, To quham þov succedit syne, And is my fallow in þat degre, Lyis vngravin, as þov sall se His body lyand on þe grene; He is my body þat I of meyne, And gif þov will the Ewangell luke, Thow sall fynd writtin in þat buke That quha him prydis in gret hycht To gret lawnes sall he licht, And quha þat haldis him self in law Till hicht his meiknes sall him draw; And, for he iugit him self meikly, Oure partiis baith ar now evinly; For he efter, throu contricioun, Off fre will tuke þe passioun Off deid, for Ihesu Cristis luf; Forthy with him he is abuf, For he him mekit in mekill thing That iugit him self fra berying, And tharfor now I command the That neire my self he gravin be, For honour suld nocht be denyit Till him that grace has iustyfyit.” Than þis Marcell, his successour, Apone þe morne with gret honour Beryit his body neire þe place Quhare Sanct Petere lyand was. Quhen þat Marcellyne þus was dede, This pape Marcellus in his steid [Sat] v. ?eris and xx. dais. Maximiane, þe story sais, For causs he wald nocht sacrify To fals mawmentis þare in hy, He gaif commandment to keip Him and pasture him with scheip; Syne in his stable he gert be Closit but fude till he couth de. Valerius, Constance and Latyne Gouernyt efter þame þe empyre syne. This Constance wes a douchty knycht, And in all weris wyss and wycht; Quhen he to Rome had wonnyng Spane, He past of counsall in Brettane, For to wyne till him þat land; And sa to hald it in his hand He come to Brettane, bot Echell, That king wes and herd of him tell, Send messingeris till him to say That he of Rome wald all his day Hald, with þi he payit na mare Than his elderis payit aire. This Constans consentit þar till, And tuke ostage þat to fulfill. Echell deit efter a moneth syne, And left a dochter, a vergyne The quhilk excedit of bewte All þe ladyis of þat cuntre, That nane in Brettane wes sa faire; And, for he saw scho wes sa faire, He gert hir leire of menstraly, And als of sciens of clergy. Scho hecht Helene, þat efter fand The cross in to þe Haly Land. This Constans tuke her till his wif, And king of Brettane wes all his lif, And gat apone hir Constantyne, That emperour of Rome wes syne. Efter þat, or past wes ix. ?ere, This Constans wes brocht on beire, And till his sone þe realme left he, That worthit of sa gret bounte, And of sa stout and sturdy deid, That he come man in his ?outhheid. Till Mercell pape syne successour Eusebyus wes, and that honour He held twa monethis and twa ?ere, And xxvii. dais cleire. His successour Melchiadess, That paip of Rome twa winter wes; He held þat na man be na way Suld nocht fast on the Sonday. Than Canakulnell sex ?eris wes, And nixt him Dernoth-Nathiles A ?ere fully in Scotland Our þe Pightis king regnand. Ferdaugh-Feyngaw neire to þai Wes king regnand ?eris twa. CHAPTER LXXXIX. How the gud emperour Constantyne Sauffit þe innocentis fra pyne. Efter þe byrth of oure lord deire Thre hundreth winter and xii. ?ere Gud Constantyne borne of Helyne, The kingis dochter of Brettane syne Baire þe noble emperour, And xxx. ?eris in þat honour He stude, in haly kirkis fay, That wes supprisit befor his day. In his tyme to Melchiadess Siluester succedand wes Pape of Rome, and xx. ?ere And thre þarto, to rekin cleire, And x. monethis, the story sais, He sat and als xi. dais. In Nysea, þat cete, A solempnyt sen?e held he; Thre hundreth bischopis and xviii. Were revestit befor him sene, And þare clerely expoundit þai To folkis haly kirkis fay. This Siluester efter þat fled Fra Constantyne, for he him dred; For he wes austerne and cruell Ay till he in lipper fell, And brak out in foull mesalry; Quharfor to medecynaris in hy For to recouer his heill he socht, Bot all thar cure availlit nocht, And þan þe bischop of þe land, That þare in tempillis were servand To þare mawmentis, said þat he Behuffit of neid bathit to be In ?oung innocentis blude al hait, Gif he recouer wald his stait. Throu this counsall þan als fast Officiaris of bidding past, And tuke vp child heire and þare In all þe stedis quhare þai waverand ware, As barnis vsis þaim playand, To þe nomyr of thre thousand, And put þaim syne in sekirnes Till a tyme þat ordanit wes Quhen þat he suld bathit be. And that samyn day as he In till his chare fra his palace One his way passit to the place That ordanit wes for his bathing, With dulfull chere and gret murnyng, The moderis of þe barnis þare Wepand, of þare heid þe haire Raiff and ruggit as thai were wod, And in þat rage on all thai ?ude Till þai met with þe emperour; Than forouth him in þat dolour Thai fell on kneis and cryit fast, Till thai him vencust at þe last. [He] beheld þame rycht increly, And had gret pete of þar cry, And stude þan evin vp in his chare, And to þaim þat about him ware He said: “Ilkane in ?our degre I pray ?ow, gif ?our willis be, Neire hand me þat ?e will draw, And giffis audiens to my saw. Off þe empyre þe ryalte, The stait, þe worschip and þe gre, As all philosophouris singis, Out of þe well of pete springis; Na þare sall nane estait endure In Cesare, king na emperoure, Quhare þat mercy takis steid, Bot all with aw or rigour leid. Forthy gud emperouris beforne, That had þe stait or I wes borne, As Titus and Waspasiane, Alexander and Adriane, Traiane als and vthere seire, That in þare dedis douchty were, Quhen in batall þai displayit Thare banaris, and þare fais assayit, Thai gaif in bidding rycht straitly, And gert oure all þare ostis cry That nane suld barne na woman sla, Na clathis of þar bodyis ta, On payne of all thai had to tyne, And to be hangit and drawin syne. Now sene sa gud befor oure dais Thame led þan, as þare story sayis, Better men were vnborne to be Na now fall in sic cruelte All ?one innocentis to sla, For ony helping þai mycht ma To þe heill of my body, That to recouer fullely Be na way can I certane be; And þai mycht recouer me, ?it it were oure cruell thing Off sa mony childer ?ing Off all oure awne natioun For to mak sic distructioun. Quhy suld we sla,” he said, “oure awne, And forbeire vther at ar vnknawin? It spedis nocht for to supprise In weire with fecht [our] innemyss, Gif we with mare cruelte Amang our self discomfit be. Men of armes throu þare mycht Thare fais our cummys in fecht, But vice or syne þaim to suppriss Throu þe vertu on þat wyss. In sic oste happinnis ay That we are starkare fere þan þai, Bot in þis cass, but dout, we are Starkare þan our self be fare. For he þat vencusis his awne will He vencusis him self be þat skill; Forthy quha happinnis for to be In þis fecht vincust, he Wynnis alhaill þe victory, And þe victour certanely Discomfyt lyis throu cruelte, Gif þat mercy and pete Be nocht with ws in to þis thraw. Forthy,” he said, “þis is my saw, Schortly to say, for in this ficht Pete oure will sall haue the mycht; For þan fere better oure innemyiss In alkin press we may suppriss, Gif it sua fall þat it be With mercy vencust and pete. He may be callit,” he said, “a lard, That mercy and pete haldis in ward; Better it is me to be dede Than to recouer,” he said, “remeid Off ony languere with þe blude And slauchter of sic multitude Off childer, ?oung and avenand, Off oure awne kyth now growand.” With that to þare moderis he Gert deliuer þaim all fre, And gaif þame giftis gret alsua, And hame frely leit þaim ga. And þat ilk nycht, lang forouth day, As slepand in his bed he lay, The honorable apostlis twa, Sanct Petere and Sanct Paull alsua, Apperit to this emperour, And gretly menyt his langour, And said: “Ihesu Crist, our Lord, That has alhaill in till his ward, Has send ws for to comfort þe, And biddis at þov sicker be Thy heill þov sall recouer weill Off all thy seiknes euerilkdeill; For þov left to spill saikles blude Off sa gret multitude Off innocentis for þi body. It is our counsall now forthy Thov pass to Siluestyre the pape, That fayne fra þe wes to eschaip, Or send, and he sall informe þe Quhairin at þov sall bathit be, And of thi lepire sa þov sall Thy heill rycht weill recouer all; And syne to Crist, þi verray lord, Thow sall mak sa gud reward That of all fals ydolis þov ger cast Doune þe templis als fast, And haly kirk þov sall restore In better stait þan it befor Thow fand it, and syne honour ay God, and keip weill Cristin fay.” Quhen þus our dryvin wes þe nycht, And on þe morne quhen day wes lycht, The emperour gert knychtis pass To seik quhare Sanct Siluester was; And quhen he saw thaim cumand neire, He wonder at thai cumand were To draw him in to þare fellony, Till haue put him in martery; Bot fra at þai had mellit samyn All togidder of þis gammyn, Thai passit to þe emperour, That resauit with honour Sanct Siluester, þe pape of Rome, And tald him syne withoutin hone All his visioun fra end till end, And askit, or he fra him wend, Gif Petyre and Paull were goddis twa. And Siluester said nay, bot þai Has powere baith to lowss and bynd, And left þar successouris þame behind. Than gert þe pape feche þe ymage Off þai apostlis in þare stage, And þe emperour affermyt at thai Were thai apperyt quhare he lay Slepand in his visioun. And þare þe paip, at wes all boune, Baptist þis emperour Constantyne, And inionyt him pennance syne In fasting all a woulk to be, And all in presoune to be fre, Lowsit quyte at þar awne will, And þe emperour grantit þartill; And als swith in þat ilk stound Off all his seiknes he wes sound, And lovit God of that chance, And maid rycht þare ane ordinance, In fredome of the Cristin fay, That he deuotly tuke þat day. For statut law first ordanit he That Crist as God suld honorit be, And worschippit with all, lest and maist, Thre personis in a Godheid traist, Fadire and Sone and Haly Gaist, And at all ydolis were bot waist Off godheid, and deuillis ware; And bad fordo þaim, less and mare. Nixt that wes his ordinance, That he suld beire and thole pennance Quha euer wiþ errasy þat blamyt Crist, Goddis Sone, or him defamyt, That he suld suffere pane and torment, Bot gif he þar of him repent. Gif ony syne in to that land Agane þe law wald tak on hand A Cristin man for to suppriss, Or for to wrang him ony wiss, The tane half of his gudis all To þe emperour suld fall As escheat without remeid, Or ony prayer, or ?it pleid. He ordanit alsua þat þe paip, That of the warld is mast bischap, Suld be oure bischopis in honour, As is our kingis þe emperour; And quha till haly kirk wald fle Suld þare haif gyrth and als saufte. Als þat nane were sa hardy In na parochin generaly Chapell to big, na oratore, But speciall leif gottin befor, Outhere of a bischop or patrone; And of alkin possessioun Suld to þe sustentatioune Off haly kirk be payit doune Baith of nobill and monay. And efter syne þe viii. day To Sanct Petyris kirk in hy He come bairefut full deuotly, And maid his confessioun, With reuth and saire contritioun, Off all þe synnis þat he had done. A mattow syne he tuke, but hone, And þat rypit to þe ground, And of þat kirk þare he can found; Off erd xii. bakkatis he baire out One his awne schulderis, but dout. And quhen þis emperour on þis wiss Wes hovin, as ?e herd deviss, And of þe Romanis a gret deill Baptist were, and trowand weill, Be þe ensample of Constantyne And throu Sanct Siluesteris prechyne, A gret part of þe cite?enys, And mony of þe suburbynis, And of the senatouris seire, At nocht baptist na trowand were, Assemblit forouth þe emperour, And said thai wald all þare murmure Schaw thare till him, gif þat he Wald nocht þar at displesit be. And þare he gaif þaim leif to say All þat in þare willis lay, Than ane for all spak in hy, And said, “At for þe novelry That wes brocht vp þan in Rome, And sen þat he tuke Cristindome, Off oure folkis þat left þar fay, That oure elderis held mony day, Euerilk day is oure cete Put in gret perplexite; For, as ?e wait and has herd tell, Neire heire by a dragoun fell Wndere erd in a cofe lyis, And to þe toune reparis oft syss, And as he ranyis and he beris, All þe toune in stynk he steris, Quhill vi. thousand on a day Throu pestilens ar deid away, That wes þe best of oure cete, Off ?oung and auld in þare degre, That ilk ?ere on þare best wiss Vsit to mak þare sacrifiss To Dame Wasta deuotly, That wes þare goddes and lady, Thare hope, þare help, and þare awowe Off þare myrthe and þare iolite: For quhom þare almuss halely And þe releif of þare maniory Thai vsit to cast to þat dragoune, That now is on ws rycht felloune. Sa, throu þe help of þat lady And þe releif of þat maniory, Ay still in till his den lay he, And anoyit nocht þis cete; Bot ay sen ?e and thai of Rome Off new þus has tane Cristindome, And has forsakin oure elderis fay, We are anoyit ilka day Throu the outragiouse violens Off ?one bestis pestilens. For thi, lord, we ask ?ow haill Remeid of þis and counsall, And ?our help, at oure cete And we may als vnperist be.” With [þat] Sanct Siluester, þat wes by The emperour, and mast redy Off ansuere, bad þai suld tell Quhare þat dragoun lay sa fell; And quhen þai said him þat þai wald With him to fecht bestis hald, Till his oratory he past, And him revest als fast, And with his clerkis syne in hy, And þai Romanis in cumpany, Till þe cofe of þat dragoune He past in till prosessioune; And þe corse on his body He maid oft syss deuotly, And in þe coif syne he Wnabasitly maid entre, A hundreth greis evin doune Wndere erd to þe dragoune; And throu his full deuote prayere That felloune best syne bristit þare; And þat done syne vp he past, With ?ettis of brass he gert close fast Off that deid den þe entre, That neuer mare sall opinnit be Befor þe mekle day of dome; And þan als fast all thai of Rome, That befor þat had nocht tane Cristindome, þan trowit ilk ane In Ihesu Crist and bapteme tuke, And þare fals mawmentis all forsuke. This Constantyne wes of Rome The first emperour tuke Cristindome Nixt Phillip, þat Dycius fell Slew, as ?e befor herd tell. This Constantyne wes first gaif land That papis ?it haldis in þar hand; He feft þe kirk on mony wiss With gret tresoure and fre franchis. Off his moder half a Brettoune He wes be kynd of natioune; He wes Sanct Helenys sone, but layne, And of his fader half a Romayne, And wes in till his begynning Bot anerely of Brettane king. CHAPTER XC. Off þe fell Dioclesiane And of his fallow Maximiane. In Rome þat tyme wes a tyrand Cruell and felloune þan regnand, That had to name Maxentius. He had all tyme a commone vse To disheriss þe noble men That in to Rome were wonnand þen, And demanyt all þe empyre With tyrandry, fellony and fyre. He put to dede Sanct Katharene, That glorius and þat sueitt virgine, Bot þis he gert hir thole in Grece That is fra Rome a weill gud pece; And þai þat were chasit of þat land Come to Constantyne to warand, And tald him of his tyrandriss, And maid him prayere on all wiss To pass with þaim and wynn þar land, And it suld be to him obeyand. He went wiþ ane oste, gret and stout, And maid it to Rome vnderlout, And syne he had þe monarchy Off all þe braid warld halely. Constantyne apone þis wiss Come first to Rome, as I deviss, And þare in to lepare fell, And helit wes, as ?e herd tell. His modere and his emys thre To Rome þat tyme with him had he, And deputis behind him he left To keip Brettane till him eft. Bot Octovyus, a gret man syne, That cummyn wes of kingis lyne, Raiss and þai deputis has slane, And held þe kinrik sa wiþ mayne, And maid him self king of þat land, And chasit his fais throu stalwart hand. Quhen þis to Constantyne wes tald, Thre legionis of knychtis bald With his moder eme, Trahen, In to Brettane send he then. A legioun is vi. thousand Sex hundreth sexty and sex beand, Off angellis, of feyndis or of men; And, as I said, þis Trahen Aryvit þan with mekle macht, And with Octouyus sone he facht, And vencust him for all his mycht; Bot he eschapit fra þe ficht, And fled to monethis neire þarby To sauf his self, bot specialy He prayit his men þai suld þaim ma With him slycht Trahen to sla. And ane erll of his cumpany Waitit Trahen sa prevely That with a buschement he [has] slane Trahen. Octouyus þan agane Raiss, and tuke till him þe land Haill agane in till his hand, And put the Romanis all away, And wes king sa till his [end] day. And all þis tyme of þe empyre Constantyne wes lord and syre, And Siluester wes pape of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome. He maid first with deuotioun Solemply dedicatioun Off haly kirk in till his dais; And be þat sampill ?it alwayis It is vsit ilk ?ere, All þe tymes fallis seire. He gert ordane altaris of stane, In haly kirk befor wes nane; Bot in Sanct Saluiouris kirk he Gert keip ane altare maid of tre Be þis ressoune, for Petyre ay His mess vsit on it to say; And all vthire, and in þare live Papis efter him successive, Quhill þis Siluester rysing wes, Vsit on it to say þar mess. Becauss of persecutioun That ay wes dreidfull and felloune, Thare wes na steid of steidfastnes Quhare in preistis mycht say thare mess, Bot in till honest houssis seire, Quhare gud Cristin folkis wonnand were, Or vnder erd in coiffis deip, That mony vsit ay clene to keip, Or betuix houssis as petyss That ordanit were on seire quayntiss, Preistis foure vsit to beire With thai foure regnys þat altere. The comet, as þe story sais, Apperit first in to þai dais; That [is] a sterne wiþ bemys schyre, Rycht as þe low of fyre, And betakinnis pestilens Quhen it makis apperens, Deid of lordis or hungyr saire, And ay it strekis þe beme mare Quhen þat mysfortoune mon ryss; That þe comate signyfyis. Constantyne þe emperour His lif þan endit with honour. In Rome þan raiss discensioun About þe richt successioun To þe empyre; Maximiane And þe fell Dioclesiane, Off quham befor ?e haif herd tell, Fra þare estait of þe empyre fell; Off þare counsall and assent, And vndeliuerit avisment, Thare estait þai renunsit haill; For þai sustene wald na travale, Bot thocht to lif on þare tresore, That þai had gaderit lang befor, In vse and quyet but travale, [And] lat þaim tak þe gouernall That aucht to succeid be lynnage To the empyre be heretage. This consent wes done in deid, And leit þe airis be law succeid. Bot efter þat Maximiane Agane þe empyre wald haif tane; And for þat causs ay in till strif He wes þe maist forss of his lif With Constantynis sonnys thre, That followit to þe ryalte. Octovyus in to þai dais, As of þe [Brute] the story sais, Off Brettane haill wes lord and king, And had it all in gouernyng. He had a dochter ?oung and faire, That of law wes þan his aire; His counsall mast part thocht þat he Suld ger his dochter maryit be With sum gret man of gret riches, And Conan-Merranduk, þat wes His nevo, neist him suld be king, For he wes neist of þare ofspring. Bot Barradok, Duke of Cornwall, Thocht it suld fere mare availl To bring fra Rome Maximiane, That of þe emperouris wes ane; And throu þis cass it fell þat he Come in Brettane with gret men?e, And that lady to wif has tane. Sa wraith at þat wes þan Conane That he assemblit all his mycht, And mellit with him in to fycht, And ourcome quhile, and sumquhile he, Till at þe last þe haill barne Off Brettane knyt þaim in sauchtnyng, Bot Maximiane be left king. Syne quhen v. ?eris wes ourgane, Swa prydit him Maximiane For his gret tresoure and riches, That him thocht Brettane to litill wes For to mantene his ryalte, Bot he wald ga wyne France all fre. Tharfor alhaill the chevalry That wes in Brettane halyly He with him to the se has tane, And alsua Merradok-Conane He tuke, and maid him a chiftane; And syne of Brettane he [has] tane Off husbandis i? thousand Till inhabit and hald that land; And xv. thousand of armyt men With him als he leiffit then, And Litill Bertane gert it call. This Conane and his ofspring all Gouernyt it sa wisly ay That it hecht Brettane to þis day. And quhen Maximiane wonnyng had All France, and till him subiect maid Trewerse, he to Rome went syne. There he slane wes throu covyne Off þe empyre Graciane, And sa endit Maximiane; And the Brettonis at with him ware Were slane and chasit here and þare, And þe few þat eschapit þan Come in Brettane to Conan. Qwhen thai of Dace and of Sythy Saw how Brettane wes vtraly Leiffit all waist of armyt men, At Brettane thai aryvit þen, And castellis and tovnis vp has tane; For with him had Maximiane All the gud fechtaris of the land, Na leiffit nane þat mycht warrand The febill small folkis in to fecht, To stynt with strenth þar fais mycht. Bot syne fra Rome come twa legionis To help and succour þe Brettonys; Graciane Municeps þan wes Thare chiftane, and to se can pass, And with þare fais syne met in fycht, And vencust thaim with mekle mycht, And chasit þaim all out till Irland. Syne of braid Brettane all þe land He tuke till him, and maid him king; Bot ?it wes he in mekle thing Fell to þe commonis; hastely Thai raiss and slew him dispituously. And quhen he dede was, þai fled ware Till Irland, and come agane rycht þare In Brettane, and it waistit wer Than þai did befor be fer. The Brettonys than þat wist na reid To help þaim selfin fra þe deid, Send on to Rome succour to craif, And said þai wald þaim all tyme haif To þare lordis, gif þat þai Wald cum and put þar fais away. Than þai of Rome a legioun send That hastely to Brettane wend, And put thai alienis away. A wall syne efter ordanit þai For to be maid betuix Scotland And þaim, sa þat it mycht stand Agane þaim þat þaim scaithit had; And it of commone cost þai maid, And ?it is callit Clydis Wall. Quhen þis wes done as I say, all The Romanis to Rome tuke þar way; Bot, or þai went, thai couth þaim say That þai wald cum na mare agane, For, or þai wald suffer sic pane, And for þaim oft be travalit sa, Thare tribut levare thai had forga. And quhen þe Romanis passit ware, All þe alienis, þat chasit are, Reparit agane, and all þe land Thai brynt with fyre and felloune hand. The wall bot litill help þaim maid, For þi thai it in keping had Were drawin wiþ cruikis oure the wall; The laif fled and it leiffit all, And þan fais, þat laisere had, Sloppis in sindry placis maid. The Brettonis wist na remeid þan, Bot a bischop, a worthy man, In Less Brettane till Audroen Thai send, at þare wes regnand then, To byd him cum and be þar king; For he wes cummyn of þe ofspring Off Brutus, þat all Brettane wan, And in the ferd gre fra Conan. To this he wald na wise consent To be þar king, bot furþ he [sent] His brother, þat wes avenand, Constantyne, wiþ twa thousand Off armyt men, baith fut and hand, Off braid Brettane to wyn þe land. Thare þai aryvit and syne facht With þar fais, and with gret macht Wencust and chasit þaim of þe land. Than all þe barnage tuke on hand To mak þare king þis Constantyne, That þe land weill gouernyt syne. Now heire I suspend of Brettane The storyis, till I haue ourtane Off þe Romanis þe storyis A part, as ?e herd me devise. CHAPTER XCI. Off þe gud Athanasyus And of þe erratik Arryus. Efter þe dede of Siluester Mark succedit nixt; twa ?ere Viii. monethis and xx. dais Pape he wes, þe story sais. At all solempnyt messis he Ordanit at þe Crede sould be Said or songin, [as] the mess Done with note or preve wes. And quhen this Mark the dede had tane, Iulius succedit, a Romane, And pape of Rome wes xi. ?ere Twa monethis and viii. dais clere. A gret sen?e gaderit he In till Necia þat cete; Thre hundreth bischopis and xviii. In that sege solempnyt were sene; Sanct Hillare and Sanct Nicholas That tyme in to þare statis was, And mony vthere bischopis ma. Athanas þat tyme alsua Maid Quicunque vult in deid, Quhare all the artiklis of þe Creid Ar devisit halely; Quha trowis nocht in þaim stedfastly Lippin him neuer sauf to be, Na fra þe panys of hell fre. That sen?e condempnit halely Off Arryus þe errasy; He held at Goddis Sone wes less In Godheid þan þe Fader wes; Off þe Fader and þe Sone he Denyit þe equalite. Of þat fals opinioun That sen?e maid condampnatioun. CHAPTER XCII. How our Lady gert a ded knycht sla Iuliane the Appostata. Thre hundreth five and fourty ?ere Eftire þe birth of oure Lord deire, Off Constantyne þe sonnys thre, Off þame befor reherss herd ?e, In this tyme to þe [empire] raiss. Constantyne þe eldest was, Syne Constantyne and Constantius; Thire thre breþer were hattin thus. Amang þaim self gret weire þai maid, Quhare throu þe Romanis harmys had, All throu þair weire and þair fechting, That endorit and had lesting Full foure and twenty ?ere, That þe Romanis neire waistit were. Bot þe eldest Constantyne Wes fra his twa breþer syne Haill þe emperour, and wes þan Emperour and gud Cristin man. The ?oungest of þe breþer thre, That Constantius eere callit we, Had with him men of counsall fell, That were in ded wonder cruell; Thai þe elder brother slew. Constantius þe empyre drew, And gouernyt it with gret stoutnes; Bot a fals erratik he wes, And liffit all in to þat fay That Arryus taucht in his day; For him in his opinioun He maid ay gret defensioun. At Constantinople, quhare he had His duelling and his prechis maid, For his opinioun þe clergy Gert him be summond rycht straitly, To heire þe condampnatioun Off his fals oponyoune. And sa on a certane set day, That for þat causs assignyt [thai], As þis Arryus him sped To þat certane assignyt steid, O neid sa he oure takin wes That him behuffit to do his eiss; With harde þare he tuke his set All planely þare in to þe mercat, Thare thrawand throe sa hard he thristit Till his bowellis within him bristit, His guttis þare, baith gret and small, And his condittis opinnit all. For þe stynk of his foull gare Mony þat about him ware Bristit þare to deid, and þus Endit þis foull Arryus. Donat [þan] wes in his stait, And in þat tyme his buke he wrait, And now childer vsis it to leire At þair begynning of þair gramere; And Sanct Ierome in þai ?eris Wes callit þe best of his scoleris. Off Sanct Andro þe body wes Translatit that tyme fra Patras To Constantynople, and Sanct Luke Translatit þidder, as sais þe buke. And Iuliane þe Appostata, That efter wes emperour alsua, In ane abbay monk him maid, For dreid of Constantius he had That he wald him to deid haif done; Bot ?it he changeit purposs sone, For all þe tyme fra land to land In monkis habit he wes wannand; For he wes to gud Constantyne His brother sone and neire cosyne, He ?arnyt till haue bene emperoure, And ay travalit to þat honour; And forthy, quhare euer he past, At wychis and at spamen fast He sperit thraly gif þat he Mycht euer optene to þat degre. In liknes þan of a spaman The deuill apperit and him said than That he suld be haill emperour, And gert him fall in sic errour That he away kest fra him quyt The monkis rewill and þe habit, And throu that deuillis suggestioun He maid renunciatioun Off bapteme and of Cristin fay, And liffit furþ in [pagane] lay. Than raiss he emperoure in þe steid Off Constantius quhen he wes deid, Bot quhow he gat þat dignite Throu similatioun and subtilite, To tell it it were oure prolixt; Forthy now will I tell þe text. For ire and fellony þat he had Till Cristin men gret lawis he maid Agane Cristindome, that mony Wnder him deit throu martery; Iohne and Paull þair passioun Tholit vnder his persecutioun. The kinrikis of Mede and of Perss, And Asy, as I herd reherss, He wan till his subiectioun, And tuke þare contributioun. Throu Capadoce syne at he past Sanct Basyly he awowit fast, That bischop wes of þat land þan, And wes of lif a haly man. This Iuliane maid in to þat quhile Gret manans to Sanct Basile, And till vther Cristin men That vnder his pouste liffit þen; And þis Sanct Basile specially Maid his prayere to oure Lady, With thra and gret deuocioun, In fasting and in vrysoune, That scho suld sum vengeance ta Off Iuliane þat Appostata. Sa slepand on a nycht him thocht All sodanely þat he wes brocht Within a kirk of oure Lady, Quhare men and women were mony, Sum on kneis in vrisoun, And sum in contemplatioun. This haly bischop Sanct Basile Slepand saw in to þat quhile The ymage of our Lady brycht Doune fra a tabernakle lycht, That outwith ane altare standand was, And tuke her raik with mesoure paise But in þat kirk, withoutin baid, Quhare þat a graif of new wes maid; Thare in wes lyand a deid knycht, Mercurius to name he hecht, Quham Iuliane þis Appostata For Crist a litill befor gert sla. Sanct Basile herd oure Lady say To Sanct Mercury that þar lay: “Ryss, Mercurius, ryss and sla Fals Iuliane þe Appostata; Revengeance þov sall tak now tyte Off þe defoull and þe despite At þat fals erratike has done Baith to me and to my sone.” With þat þe ymage als fast Off oure Lady agane past, And in hir tabernakle ?eid; And þe deid knycht raiss gud speid, And tuke a speire in till his hand, That by þe graif wes þan lyand, And rakit of þe kirk his way. And as þe legend tellis perfay, That, as this tyrand Iuliane Wes rydand forouth his oste ilkane, Marcurius smat him with his speire Throu out þe hert, and slew him there. Bot þare wes nane þat saw þis sycht, Bot Sanct Basyle, þat bischop rycht, That wakand efter þat rycht lay Till on þe morne at it wes day; Than herd he tell that Iuliane With sudane dede wes þan ourtane; Than went he to the kirk in hy, And þare þe spere he fand bludy; [Than] wist he weill þat of Iuliane Wengeance throu his prayere wes tane. Sanct Martyne þan wes in his flouris, And vthere sindry confessouris; And this Sanct Martyne wes a knycht Off þis Iuliane, bot in ficht He fauorit euer Cristin men, Till he came cristinnit, as ?e ken. Till him þan wes contemporane In Scotland Sanct Niniane, In to þe tyme þat Sanct Mertyne wes, And led his lit in halynes. And be oure cornykillis of Scotland Ebornet wes regnand King oure þe Pightis xl. ?ere. Syne, quhen his dais endit were, Talarge wes king, and led his lif In Scotland twenty ?eris and five, Till all the ?eris were ouregane Off Constantius and Iuliane, And all the emperouris bedene That in baith þire tymes had bene. CHAPTER XCIII. This chapiter tellis trewly Quha maid first Gloria Patri. Liber, Felix and Damascus, Efter þe dede of Iulius, Off Rome wes papis in þare live, Ilkane till oþer successive. This Damasyus, I herd reherss, Couth mak rycht weill in metyre verss, Sanct Ierome wrait till him, but weire, Amangis vthere haly writtis seire, Gloria Patri in twa verss, And bad at he suld ay reherss Efter ilk psalme þai twa, As halikirk ?it vsis swa. Quhen this Damasyus wes pape of Rome, This glorius doctour Sanct Ierome Wes his awne luffit famuliere, And translatit þe psaltere At his request and instance. This Damasyus maid ordinance That preistis and clerkis in þe quere Suld stand, as now is þe manere, One athere syde ordinaly, And of þe psalmys destinctly The ta part suld þe first verss say, The toþer part þe nixt verss ay Suld begin and say, ilk syde Suld suffere and þare tyme abyde, With Gloria Patri at þe end Off ilk psalme, as now is kend; [And] haly kirk on to þire dais Haldis and kepis the vss alwais. Efter þe dede of Iuliane Iowyne and Valentynyane Emperouris was baith successive; Bot Valentynyane in þe live Off þe Appostata Iuliane As of his knychtis wes chiftane, And þan, as him behuffit of neid For to leif Cristindome or knychtheid, He left knychtheid of his fre will, And Cristin treuth he tuke him till; Bot syne, efter þat Iuliane Wes endit with dede subitane, To that fell persecutour Him happinnit to be [successour]. The Saxonis þat tyme, þat were wycht, Raiss agane Rome with mekle mycht With thare navyne on the se. Thare chiftane wes of gret degre, Faire of fassoune and of face, Bot subtill of engyne he was, Pert of chere and eloquent, And sober in to jugisment, Off few wordis and myld of mude, And in efferis sicker and gud. His broþer Valens held þat fay That Daryus held in his day; All Cristin men he hecht forthy For to discess excedandly; Bot this Valentynyane emperour Gaynstude and lettit his honour. Durst-Erchsone þan in Scotland Wes oure þe Pightis king regnand, And held that stait i? ?ere, And did a hundreth batallis seire. CHAPTER XCIV. Off a ferlifull barne borne, Off sic ane wes nane sene beforne. Efter the dede of Damysyus The pape of Rome Cericyus Xi. monethis and xv. ?ere And xx. dais thar to cleire The se he held as pape of Rome. The clerk in his tyme Sanct Ierome Translatit þe Bibill of Hebrew; And baith þe testamentis, ald and new, He translatit in Latyne; And in his dais Sanct Augustyne Of new resauit Cristindome. Quhen þis Syrycius wes pape of Rome Sanct Ambross in þe awphonere Antemmys maid and respondis seire, And versiculis thare to he can write, And ympnis alsua maid in dite, And thai antemmys ordanit he Amang thai psalmis said to be At matinnis and at evinsang, At pryme and houris all amang; And on þis wise and þis manere The seruice first begouth in qweire. And in this tyme als þat I tell In Emaus, quhare wes a castell, A barne þar wes þat tyme y-borne That sic ane wes nocht sene beforne; For at þe navill haill it wes And outwith þe navill diuisioun has, With foure eyne and hedis twa, Foure eris and foure browis alsua, Twa mouthis and double chyne, And doubill tuthit baith within; Foure handis it had ?it, And twenty fyngeris and foure feit, And xx. [tais] it had alsua; Betuix þe theis ?erdis twa; And þus ay doubill in liknes In to þat barne apperand wes, For quhen the ta heid vsit to sleip The toþer heid wald walk and weip, And quhen þe tane wald vse till ete Than wald þe toþer neuer ete; And þus it liffit neire twa ?ere Vpone þis wiss and þis manere, And quhen þe tane wes dede away The toþer liffit to the thrid day. Than wes Orosyus in his stait, And his buke to Sanct Augustyne wrait. Galiene syne and Graciane, And ?oungare Valentynyane, Off þe empyre þe ryalte Foure ?eris held amang þam thre. Syne raiss þe secund Graciane, And his broþer Valentynyane, And Theodosyus, all thre Sex ?eris held þat ryalte. This Graciane efter syne Come of weire till Argentyne, And xxx. thousand in that ficht Off his fais to deid he dicht, Throu vertu of the Cristin fay That he stedfastly held alway; For in his tyme all Ytaly Off Herryus held þe errasy, Bot ?it in till his dais he Gert it all conuertit be. He wes abill in letterature, In meit and drink of gret mesoure, All lust of body he oure come, And endit weill in Cristindome. CHAPTER XCV. Off Theodosyus þe gud emperour That Sanct Ambross brocht fra errour. Thre hundreth ?ere foure score and sevin Efter þe birgh of God of Hevin, Theodosyus past on weire In till Grece with gret powere, And wan þe toune of Thessaly, A gret cete and a mychti, That had conspyrit all in ire Agane the stait of þe empyre, And his luftennendis þai slew þare, And of vthere officiaris, þat of him baire Stait and cure, thai slew all doune In to that cete rycht felloune. This Theodosyus forthy Gert sla all doune without mercy, With thai mysdoaris saikles blude, That nomerit were in multitud Five thousand men, but barnis and wiffis, That at þat slauchter lossit þe liffis; And efter þat distructioun Out of þe land he maid him bovne, And come in Lumbardy agane Evin to the cete of Myllane. Thare Sanct Ambross, þat haly man Wes of þat cete bischop þan, Herd tell how þat saikles blude Wes spilt in to sic multitude. As Theodosyus on a day Fra his palace tuke þe way Towart þe kirk, in to þat quhile This Sanct Ambross vtouth þe stile Him met and said: “Quhether art þov bovne? I mak þe inhibitioun In Goddis kirk to mak entre Till thi trespass amendit be. Thav knawis þi self as emperour, Bot nocht þi dedis of errour; Thow kennis nocht at ar felloune, Na þe charge of thi prescriptioun; Thov comptis nocht þat in wodnes Gert sla sa mony þat wes saikles; Bot þe welth þat þov art in Gerris þe þusgatis mysknaw þi syne; Forthy it nedis þat ressoune Thyne vnreullis habandoun; For natur, certis, ay suld be Considerit in mortalite, And of our tyme þe latter day We suld haif in memor ay, And of our dedis þat we haif wrocht, And to quhat end we haif þaim brocht; And nouþer in strenth of oure ?outhheid, Na in þe coloure of oure faire heid, Na ?it in robis of fyne purpure, Standis þe stait of oure errour; For throu the feble infirmyte Off brukill flesche, baith þov and we Ar baith elike as be nature, For all þi hycht and þi honour. Thow art bot seruand ?it, I wiss, Off sic seruandis as þov is; A lord is at we God call, A king and makare of ws all. How dare þov with þin ene se The temple of þe Trinite? How dar þov think in þin entent To tred apon hallowit pathment With thi feit at sa fast ?ude To ger spill sic saikles blude? How may þov heif þi handis on hycht Till hevin, or till God of mycht, Quhare of þe saikles blude dropand Has fylit baith þi sleif and hand? How dar þov think in þin entent To ask þe haly sacrament? For þi pass hame, and press þe nocht To þat fell syne þat þov has wrocht For till eik ane, till þov it mend, And thole quhat God will on þe send. Perchance it may be medicyne Off syne, at þov has lang in lyne.” All þire wordis þe emperour, As cunnand in till letteratour, Herd, and thaim consauit weill Quhat fell to bischopis ilk deill, And went on hame with saire siching, With repentance and gret murnyng, Till aucht monethis weire neire past, And ?ule wes followand als fast, Quhen Ihesu Crist Lord wes borne To sauf mankynd þat wes forlorne. Than Rufyne, his famuliere, That all tyme wes him with and neire, Sperit þe causs of his doloure; Than till him ansuerd the emperour, Menand sairely his trespas, Sayand: “Allace, at he borne was That he sic horrible causs suld ma Haly kirk to be put fra, That commone is to knaif and knycht, And till all Cristin creature rycht; To fre and gentill, bond and thrall, The kirk is opin to þaim all That cumis with deuotioun To God to mak þare orisoun, And for my syne is closit me fra, And hevin is closit fra me alsua.” Than said Ruffyne: “I will ga trete, Withoutin wordis of aw or threte, With þe bischop, to change his saw And his decrete in myldare law.” Till him þan ansuerd Theodoss: “Pass on, bot I trow at Ambross Sall neuer discerne bot it is rycht That I be put furth of my plycht, For nouþer king nor emperoure May gere him inclyne till errour, Na gere him reuoke þat at he Decretis for rycht equite; For I him knaw sa wiss a man That all þair wittis him mend na can.” Quhen this [had] spokin Theodoss, Ruffyne past on till Ambrose, And quhen he had tald his trete, Ambross said: “Ruffyne, me think þe Like a bund dog þat ay brayis, For þov me in þis thing assayis, Barkand agane þe maiestie Off mychti God be þi trete, Set at þov say at þe emperour Mak him to cum throu his terrour, I sall agane stand and lat at he Within þe kirk sall mak entre. Supposs þe stait of his empyre Be changeit in tyrandry and ire, My dede I sall thole wilfully, Or he me wyn wiþ his mastry.” Ruffyne þan, his mediatour, Past agane to þe emperour, And all þe wordis of Ambross He rehersit to Theodoss, That ansuerd him and said meikly: “To þe bischop now bodely I will pass, and heire quhat he For my defalt will say to me.” And sa he did, bot nocht forþi, For all his mycht and sen?eory, Within þe kirk durst he nocht ga, Bot without it byding can ma; He sat him doun to wait and se The bischopis oportunyte. Sone efter þe bischop bodely He saw, and salust him meikly, And on his baire kneis sone doune he fell, And prayit him, þe suth to tell, That he wald louss him of his syne And bandis þat he lay bunding in; Thus maid he faire and meik prayere. The bischop þan on þis manere Said: “Þi powere certanely Is like all to fell tyrandry; Thus mayis þe agane God to weid, And to fordo his law in deid.” “Na,” said þe emperour, “on na wiss Think I agane his law to ryss, Na think I neid for to wirk Agane þe stait of haly kirk, Na ?it in it to mak entre, Till ?e, fader, assol?e me, And lowss me of ?one band of syne And cumbranss at I am fallin in. Lat nocht be stekit aganis me The ?et of hevin, at ay salbe Opin till all men penitent, And askis mercy wiþ trew entent; For God him self is to mercy Than to vengeans ay mare redy. This is the sovme of my prayere, As I that meikly is cummyn heire.” Than said þe bischop: “Quhat pennance Has þov done, or ?it repentance, For thi gret fell iniquite? Quhat medicyne has þov done, lat se, To heill or to raiss þaim agane That in thi breich þov gert be slane?” Full meikly þan þe emperour Said with reuerens and honoure: “Fader, ?our part is till [inione] My pennance þat ?e wald haif done, And temper ?oure medicyne now sa That I mycht þe rycht way ga; And I obliss me to fulfill All ?our bidding with gud will.” The bischop þan at his meiknes And his wordis mare sekere wes, And said: “Se? ressoune þin entent Rewllit [noucht] all in iugisment, Bot ragit wauerand or wodnes, And held nane ordour of rychtuisnes, For law I will þov now ga dyte And with haist in þi letres writt That sentens of evin rychtuisnes Fordo decretis of wodnes; Writt als, and for law allwayis Gert hald, that full xxx. dayis Sentens of deid or bannysing Be kepit close but publising, For to byde iugisment of ressoune With rype examinatioun; Sa þat it may be sessit weill, Thai dayis passit oure ilk deill, And sa throu law and equite All thing may rycht disponit be; And sentens gevin full lauchfully May hald and bynd all sekirly, And þat sentens with forme of law The iuge may with gud counsall knaw That mony sall follow syne na schame, Na till his stait sall fall na blame, Na be oure hasty iugement Sall be supprisit nane innocent.” The emperour consauit weyll All þir wordis ilk deill, And oblist him for to fulfill All þir statutis with gud will, And maid þare his confessioun, And tuke syne absolutioun. And in þe kirk with gud entent He enterit and kissit the pathment, And baid standand without the queire, Quhare all þe commonis standand were, Herand þe mess all þat quhile, Quhill red and done wes þe ewangile, And kepit þe tyme of þe offerand. One kneis þan to þe preistis hand He past, and stude syne in the queire, Off þat mess þe laif to heire. The bischop þan with stout will Askit quhy he baid þare sa still, Haldand within the queire þat place That neuer to seculare ordanit was. The emperour ansuerd þan meikly, And said: “For na hicht of sen?eory Byde I heire, bot in gud entent For to resaue the sacrament.” The bischop chargeit till him þan His archdene, a cunnand man, That said till him: “Schir emperoure, ?e leif þe queire with ?our honour; For þe queire all halely For preistis ordanit specially, And to clerkis on þare wiss To syng or say þare Goddis seruice. Set ?oure array of riche purpure Schaw ?ow now heire as emperoure, ?our purpure may nocht preistis ma; Out of þe queire I reid ?ow ga, And but amangis the commonyte Byde thare ?our oportunyte Thare to tak ?our sacrament.” Than but he past with gud entent, And said but ony rebellioun In till his excusatioun: “I wend that manere here had bene In Constantinople as I had sene; Thare in þe queire of honour Is a steid for þe emperour; Bot lovit be God,” said he syne, “This is bot hailsum medicyne For the woundis of my syne, That I am lyand stynkand in.” And all þis tyme þat I of tell, His wif, þat callit wes Dame Placell, A faire lady and a plesand, Honest, abill and avenand, Haly and religiouss, Did mony dedis of almouss. Scho vsit to vesy bodely All pure folkis wes neire hir by, In meit and drink, and in clething, And in all othere neidfull thing; Scho wayndit nocht þare feit to wesche, Na ?it to feche þaim fische nor flesche; Baith to sympill, seik and saire, Hir besynes scho wald nocht spaire, Bot seruit þaim with þar awne handis, Lipnand nocht till hir seruandis. Quhen scho wes arguyt at þat mycht be Dedeyne weill for hir ryalte, And gaif þame siluer or payment, Or claith to syþ thare entent, Scho [said] sic workis of honour Fell till hir lord [the] emperour, For to sympill, scho said, wes scho Sic dedis as scho did to do. Scho wald say oftsyss till her lord: “Schir, ?e suld with ?our self record Quhat ?e haif bene, and is to be, And þar with alsua think suld ?e To be kynd to ?our Creature That has ?ow put in þis honour, And be rychtuis, and ?e sall weill Gouerne ?our empyre euer ilk deill.” Betuene þis bischop Sanct Ambross And this gud emperour Theodoss Wes maid this mediacioun And gud reconsiliacioun, And be þaim baith þan landis seire Wes brocht to Cristin treuth all cleire. The dedis of þis gud emperour Suld be, lordis, ?our merour, For to forbeire iniquite, And deme with law and equite, With rycht of haly kirk to stand, And fauour þame in it seruand, Na with oure haisty iugisment For to suppriss nane innocent. To bischopis all tyme bowsum be, And luf preistis in cherite, Pay at ?e aw to þe kirk blithly, Tak na thing fra þaim wranguisly. It may be callit vnhonest tul?e To se þe quyk þe dede dispul?e Quhen he is woundit in his schete; It is ensampill to ?ow ?ete, Or like to þat thing all þar neist, A gentillman to reiff a preist.

Efter all þis, this gud emperour Led furþ his lif in hie honour; Baith pure and riche in þare degre He luffit and led in honeste; All tyrandris and mawmentriss Ay he resistit, and lollandris; And tempillis of thare deuocioun He gert distroy and cast all doune.

Four hundreth winter and thar to sevin Efter þe birgh of God of Hevin, The first Innocent þan, pape of Rome And kepare of all Cristindome, Xv. winter and twa dayis He wes pape, as Frere Martyne sayis. The pax þan first ordanit he At all messis gevin to be Euerilk day, bot quhen þe mess Sanging for Cristin saulis wes. He ordanit als, quhen men suld de, Anoyntit with haly oile to be. He ordanit to fast þe Setterday, For in his graif þat tyme Crist lay. That tyme þe emperour Archaid To wif a wickit woman had; Scho wes hattyne Euoxia. Off her selfin þan gert scho ma Ane ymage like her properly, In till all fassoune of body; And formyt fyllokis of that land And damycellis ?oung and plesand Befor þat image ilk day Scho gert cum to danss and play. Quhen Crisostome, þat gret clerk, In his preching callit þat werk A foull vice of mawmentry, Scho gert þat cunnand clerk forthy Fra Constantynoplis cete, Quhare of bischop þan wes he, Bot put þar fra and bannyst quyte, Throu her fellony and despyte; And, for þe emperoure gaif his assent Thare to, þis pape Innocent Cursit þis emperour solempnytly, For he furtherit sic tyrandry. This pape Innocent alsua Ordanit þat bischopis suld ma Ordouris befor Mychaelmes Ilk ?ere, gif mister wes. And quhen þis Innocent wes dede ?i?ynnyus sat in his steid Sevin monethis and twa ?ere, And xxv. dais clere. Clerkis þat tyme forbad he That þai suld tavernaris be. In to þat tyme Honorius And ?oungare Theodosius Wes like a vertuouss gouernall, And of his gudis full liberall, And till all men famuliar, Curtase and keynd in all manere. Quhen it wes gevin him for counsall To sla his rebellouris haill, That raiss him and his stait agane, He said þame þat he wald be fayne And he mycht be of sa gret mycht, Outhere be powere or be slycht, A man fra deid to lif to raiss, For men to slaw wes nocht to praiss; Forthy he chesit of þai twa Men erare to saufe þan sla. Pelagyus, borne in till Brettane, A clerk and a rycht wickit man, Proponit þat tyme opinly Conclusionis of gret errasy. Off thai conclusionis ane þis wes, Man mycht haif for out Goddis grace, And haue þe ioy of hevin to meid, Thocht he in rychtuisnes nocht proceid; Bot þat is errour, for efter our deid We sall be iustyfyit, but dreid, Bot we repent ws of our ill, Ellis mon we haue as ressoun will. He said þat barnis abortive, Quhen thai were borne haiffand þe live, Were frely quyt, withoutin faill, Fra Adamis syne originall, Na þe bapteme, he said, in deid Did nocht bot ekit þaim to meid. On þis a counsall gret wes sene; Thre hundreth bischopis and xviii. In Cartage þat tyme gaderit ware; Thai errasyis þai condempnit þare. Than deit þis pape ?i?ynnyus, And nixt him Bonyfacius Succedit pape, and twa ?ere And to thai viii. monethis cleire. Quhen he wes dede þan dais nyne The se þan vaikit, and Celestyne Pape of Rome wes xviii ?ere And xxi. dais cleire. Iudica me Deus ay He ordanit þat preistis suld say, Revestit to þe mess, befor Or thai began Confiteor. Sanct Ierome þat tyme, þe doctour, Deit in Bethlem with honour; And als Sanct Austyne in þai dais Deit, as þe story sais, That wes bischop of Ypone.

How þe noble king Arthure Wes slane throu Mordred þe tratour. Four hundreth xxx. ?eris and thre Eftir þe blessit Natiuite This Celestyne, pape of Rome And kepare of all Cristindome, Send Sanct Patrik in Irland, And Sanct Pallady in Scotland, In thai landis for to preche, The folkis in Cristin fay to teche. Than ?oungare Theodosius, Quhen dede wes gud Honorius, Wes to þis pape contemporane, And with him Valentyneane Emperouris were xx. ?ere And vii. attour, to rekin clere. That tyme in to þe Ile of Cretee, That lyis within þe Mekle Se, And now men callis it Candy, The deuill apperit þare bodely To þe Iowis, and said he wes The haly prophet callit Moyses, And gert þame fermely trow þat he Suld bring þaim saufly our þe se, And all þare gait he gert be dry; Bot in þat desait deit mony, For all þai þat him followit þare In þat deip se drownit ware. Off Constantinople cete þan The bischop wes a wickit man, Nestorius callit be name. On our Lady þis defame He set, and said þis veraly, Scho baire nocht God of hir body; Bot he said þat sympilly þan Off hir body scho baire bot man. Twa hundreth bischop þare of anone Wes gaderit in till Ephesone Befor þis Celestyne in hy, And condempnit þis fals errasy. Theothocone þai ordanit all Our Lady in haly kirk to call, That is þe moder properly Off God and man baith verraly. Quhen dede wes þis pape Celestyne, Aucht ?eris and dais nyne Sext the thrid held þat steid, And efter þat, quhen he wes deid, Leo wes maid paip of Rome, And kepare of all Cristindome, Twa monethis and xxx. ?ere And xxvii. dais cleire. He wes a solempnit clerk, And did mony clerklik werk. To þe Emperour Marceane He wes þan contemporane, And till his wif þe emprise He wrait and send full faire tretise To draw hir hert to Cristin fay, And þare in to be steidfast ay; And of Cristis Natiuite Solempne sermondis thare maid he. Quhen this pape Leo wes One a Pasche day singand mess, A faire woman at the offerand Come with vthire and kist his hand, And of þat kyss all sodanely Thare raiss a lust in his body; And, for of þat temptacioun His hand wes þe occasioun, He gert smyte of his hand forthy Quyte away fra his body. Sa efter þat gret murmure wes Quhy he vsit nocht to sing his mess; And for þat fame deuotly Prayere he maid till oure Lady, With gret walking and fasting, For to succour him sum thing, And to sauf him fra þat defame At he sustenit, and sic schame. Than Mary myld, oure Lady fre, Apperit till him at he mycht se, And till his stomp scho set his hand, And maid it and it evin growand, That he wes abill to sing his mess; And þus restorit throu hir grace he wess, And prechit efter opinly This myrakle of oure sueit Lady, And lowit hir apon all wiss And deuote wes in his seruiss. For the gud werkis he vsit to werk He is ?it lovit in halykirk; One Petere and on Paulis evin ay Ilk ?ere is his fest day. The vii. sleparis þan raisit were That slepand lay thre hundreth ?ere, And seventy ?ere þar to and twa, As þare story can mencioun ma; Fra þe dede of Decius Till ?oungare Theodosius Thai slepit, as þe story sayis, And sa mony ?eris it wes and dais. To this Leo pape contemporane Valentyne and Marciane Off þe empire held þe stait Sevin ?eris, as Frere Martyne wrait. The Saxonis out of Ducheland Arryvit þat tyme in Ingland, And Merlyne alsua mystely That tyme maid his prophasy. How Wortygerne wiþ his falsheid Off Brettane maid the kingis deid; How Vtere and Aurelyus, To surname callit Ambrosius, Off Ingland prevely past þan, And efter baid in Less Brettane; And how the Saxonis with þar slycht In Ingland come with all þar mycht, And ekit in sic multitude At þai slew doune þe Brutis blude, And Ingland þar efter ay Thai haif haldin to þis day, The [Brute] tellis it sa opinly That I will lat it heire ga by. The Saxonis in Ingland were Quhen Theodosius þe ?oungare Off þe empyre held þe estait, As in þis buke befor I wrait. Quhen þis Leo þe pape wes deid, Syne Hyllare sat in till his steid Thre monethis and vi. ?ere And x. dais þar to cleire. Efter him Symphisius, The thrid Felix and Galicius Off Rome were papis successive, Ilk ane till oþer in þar live; Xxvii. dais and thre In Rome þai held þe papis se. Quhen þir papis thre were þan To þe empyre contemporane, The emperour þe first Leo, Till [him] succedit syne ?eno, And þir twa emperouris in to þar live Held þe empyre successive Xxx. ?eris fully and ma. Anestasius efter þai Xiii. ?eris lord and syre Held þe stait of þe empyre. And quhen þis Leo wes emperour King of Brettane þan wes Arthour, That wan all France and Lumbardy, Gascone, Gyane and Normundy, Flandris, Burgone and Braband, Celland, Holland and Fresland, Swessioun, Swethrik and Norway, Denmark, Irland and Orknay; And all þe Ilis in þe se Subiect were till his pouste; And all þir cuntreis ilk ane To þe crovne of Mare Brettane He ekit haill, and maid þaim fre But tribut till his ryalte, Withoutin seruice or homage, Or ony payment of trewage Maid to Rome, as forouth þai Wsit lang tyme for to pay. Quharfor þe stait of þe empyre, That muffit were in to gret ire, The hawtane message till him send That in Arthuris Gestis is kend, That Huchoun of þe Auld Ryall, Maid his Gestis Historiall, Has tretit fere mare cunnandly Than sufficient to tell am I. Bot in our mater to proceid, Sum þat hapnis þis buke to reid Will call þe autour to rekles, Or may fall argw his cunnandnes, Sen Huchone of þe Auld Ryall, In till his Gestis Historiall, Callit Lucyus Hyberius emperour Quhen king of Brettane was Arthour. Bot Huchoune baith and þe autour Giltles ar of þat erroure. For þe first autouris to say, Thare storyis quha þat will assay Off Oross, Martyne and Innocent, Wrait þare storyis diligent, And ?it Iosaphus, all foure, That mony storyis had sene oure, Callit nocht þis Lucyus emperour Quhen king of Brettane was Arthour; Bot of the Brute þe story sais That Lucyus Hyber in his dais Wes of þe empyre procuratour, And nouthere callit him king, na emperour. Fra blame þan is þe auctour quyte, As he befor him fand to write; And men of gud discretioun Suld excuss and loif Huchoun, That cunnand wes in litterature. He maid þe gret Gest of Arthure, And þe Anteris of Gawane, The Epistill als of Suete Susane. He wes curyouss in his stile, Faire and facund and subtile, And ay to plesance and delite, Maid in meit metyre his dite, Litill or ellis nocht be gess Wauerand fra þe suthfastnes. Had he callit Lucyus procuratour, Quhare he callit him emperour, It had mare grevit the cadens Than had relevit the sentens; For ane emperour, in properte, A commandoure may callit be; Lucyus sic mycht haue bene kend Be þe message at he send. Heire sufficiand excusacionis For wilfull defamacionis; He mon be ware in mony thingis That will him keip fra mysdemyngis. Off Arthuris gret douchtynes, His worschip and his wiss prowes, His conquest and his ryall stait, As Huchon in his Gestis wrait, How þat he held in till his ?eris His Round Table with his Ducheperis, And how he tuke syne his viage, Fra Lucyus had send him message, Till Ytaly with all his mychtis Off kingis, lordis, and of knychtis, And þare discomfyt þe emperour, And wan gret worschip and honour Off France neire þe bordouris set, [In] were as þai togidder met, And of the tressoune till him done Be Mordred, his sister sone, Tharfor in haist he come agane, And with him faucht in till Brettane, Quhare he and his Round Tabill quyt Wes vndone and discomfyt, Huchoune [has tretid] curyously In gest of [Brutis] ald story. Bot of his dede and his last end I fand na writt couþ mak it kend; Sen I fand nane at þar of wrait, I will say na mare na I wait. Bot quhen at he had fochtin fast, Efter þat in ane Ile he past, Saire woundit, to be lechit þare, And efter he wes sene na mare. Bot in his tyme Schir Constantyne, Schire Cadoris sone, his awne cosyne, That þan wes Duke of Cornwall, King wes maid of Brettane haill, And set apon his hede þe crovne, And gaif him full possessioun. Fra þe birgh of oure Lord deire Five hundreth twa and xx. ?ere, In þis tyme þat I tell of þus, The pape of Rome Galasyus In till his deuociones Ympnes maid and orisonis, And þe prefacis of þe mess That syne for commone vsit wes. The bischop Mawmert of Wyene The thre dais gert be fastit then, And haldin þe processioun, Befor þe Ascencioun, That now mony nationis Callis þe Rogacionis; For a gret erdyn and felloune Smat baith houses and touris doune Within þe cete of Wyen, And wyld wolffis þan weryit men; And for þir causes þat tyme he Gert þis fasting and prayeris be, As ?e may ?it ilk ?ere Se þe oiss and þe manere. A commone woman, þat in poytry Liffit in Rome þan lustfully, Sevin barnis baire at anys, The quhilkis in flesche and blude and banys, By a stane at a gait syde, Quhare men vsit for to ryde, Scho laid þai barnis opinly. Sa fell þe king of Lumbardy Come wiþ his court, of caiss rydand, And saw þai barnis þare sprewland, With his spere end turnyt ane, And þat child wiþ his hand has tane The speire, and held it manlely; The king þan lewch and said hely: “May this child lif, I trow, but dreid, He sall cum to stait and manheid.” He gert that child be takin þan, And fosterit vp quhill he wes man, And wes his aire of Lumbardy And king, and gouernyt it wisly. And quhen Leo þe first wes deid, Till him succedit in his steid The secund Leo, þat his sone wes, And athere raxit and raiss; And eftere him of þe empyre ?eno, as I said, wes syre, And stude in þat stait vii. ?ere, And maid in his tyme lawis seire. He set him slely till haue slane This ?oung Leo with a sle trayne. The moder of þis child for þi Schupe to dissaue him prevely; Ane vthere child in his figour Scho gert gif to þe emperour, And that ilk child without remeid Sa wes he throu hir put to deid; And Leois sone and hirris slely Scho put to scoill and to clergy, Ay quhill Iustyne lord and syre Raiss to þe stait of þe empyre. Theodorik, a mychty king, That Gotland had in gouernyng, Till þis ?eno maid homage, And gaif him his sone in hostage, That callit wes till his fader like Be proper name Theodorik. This child baid with the emperour, And halding in to gret honour, Till he wes xviii. ?eris of eild, That he mycht armes or wappinis weild. This ?eno send him till Ytaly With his awne Gotis mychty, For a tyrand, Adonatere, Held þat land till him of weire Aganis þe mycht of the empyre; And þarfor ?eno in till ire Gert þis child pass, as I haif said, With banere in his oste displayid, Fra Constantynople to Bulgary, And on furth to Pamony. Throu all þe landis haill he past Quhill he neire Rome come at þe last. Sa quhare he lay apon a nycht Adonatere come with his mycht, And fauch with him þare [fellonly], Bot he defendit sa manlely; Bot þis Adonater in þat fecht Discomfit wes, and tuke þe flicht To Rome, bot þare na wiss mycht he To succour sauf resauit be. Thare for he sped him to Wyen, And þare wes he resauit þen, Quhare þis Theodorik of weire Assegeit him with his powere, And [wan] him þare, and but remeid He put him þare to shamefull deid. To Rome syne with gret ryalte He went, and þare resauit wes he And haldin in to þe honour, Luftennend to þe emperour. Thus first the Gotis cummyn were In till Rome with þare powere. Bot his fader, king Theodorik, Gret tyrand wes and erratik. [Boece] þe mast of the senatouris, That þan wes liffand in his flouris, Becauss þat in þat ilk tyme he Gaynstude his iniquite, Haldand forme and rychtuisnes, Quhen crymes fals amesit wes, Throu his tyrandry in þat quhile He put fra Rome in herd [exile], And in þe cete of Pawy Off sciens of philosophy He wrait þare þe bukis five, To reull men in steidfast live. To þis pape Galisyus The secund Anastasyus Succedit, and twa ?eris he Held in Rome the papis se; And þis tyrand Theodorike, That wes felloune and erratik, Raiss as neist successour To ?eno befor emperour. Errasyis he fauorit ay, And supprisit þe Cristin fay; The pape Anastace for thy Cursit him þare for solemply, And forthy þat tyrand wes Ay vnhappy and but grace, That na tyme of his innemyss Socht he to wyn victoryiss, Bot wes at vndire with þaim ay, In dreid and dule till his end day. Bot sum sais at Schir Anastace Emperoure of Rome þan was, Quhen þis Anastas wes pape And of þe warld þe mast bischap. Off Cartage þan Olympyus Held of þe arratik Arryus In all his tyme þe fals fay; Sa in his breich apon a day With wickit wordis and felloune he Defamit þe Haly Trinite; Ane angell all in flame of fyre Was sene schutand a dart of ire, And slew þat erratike in hy With þat scharp schot all sodanely. Ane vthere Arryane þan was A bischop callit Barrabas; As he baptist anys a man Thire wordis he said our him þan: Baptizat te Barrabas in nomine Filii Et Patris et in Spiritu Sancto. And for he did nocht þe sacrament With detfull wordis and gud entent, The watter of þe font forthy Wes quyte away all sodanely, And he þat baptist suld haif bene, Fra he þis myrakle had sene, Off ane vthere in gud entent He tuke the haly sacrament. The pape þat ilk day till him sone Send legatis, quhen þis wes done, To monest þare lauchfully For to leif his errasy; Bot to þaim he wald nocht appeire, Nor na thing of þare message heire; Tharfor þis erratike suthly Wes slane with þe fyrflaucht soda[nly.] Quhen Anastas þe pape wes ded, Symyacus sat in his steid Fiftene ?eris and monethis sevin And xx. dais þarto evin. Gloria in excelsis he Ordanit, sum sais, first to be Said or songin at þe mess, As ay sen syne þe manere wes. The Almanays þat tyme of weire Past in France with gret powere. Clodoueus þat tyme king, That had all France in gouernyng, Come with his oste in gud array Agane þai Almanys, suth to say, And awowit deuotly To God to grant him victory, For to becom Cristin man, And lelely to serve him þan. And þare þe Almanys in þat fecht Were vincust haill throu Goddis mycht, And þe king efter þat deuotly Off þe bischop Sanct Remegy, Sanct Leonard als, sais þe buke, Efter þe king þan bapteme tuke, And þat haly bischop Remegy That brocht him vp full tenderly. In þis Symyacus electioun Thare raiss a gret discencioun; For a part chesit Symyacus, Ane vther part Laurencius; The pepill þare and þe clergy In þat discordit velausly. Befor ?oung Theodorik king, That Rome had þan in gouernyng, In to þe cete of Rawen The Romanis all assemblit þen; Thare þis Symyacus gert he Chosin and confermyt be. Bot Symyacus efter þis Defamyt wes of gret crymes, All throu falsheid and invy, Be þat Laurencius þat opinly Said þat intrusit wes he Throu mastry in þe papis se; And sa þe pepill and þe clergy Agane discordit velausly. A solempne sen?e þare wes sene Off twa hundreth bischopis and fiftene; Off all þai crymes, maire and less, This Symyacus þare purgit wes, And sa with honour þare wes he Confermyt in þe papis se, And Lourens with his defamouris Condempnyt were as fals chellouris. Quhen Symyacus þis paip wes deid, Ornysday nyne ?ere held þat steid, And reullit weill all his clergy, And techit þe folkis vertuously. And in þe tyme at þe pape was, The auld emperour deit Anastas, And Iustinus þe emperoure Till him nixt wes successour. He faworit all tyme Cristin fay, And errasyis he pvnist ay. This pape Ornysday till him wrait For to supple Cristin stait, And at he suld þe bischopis all Agane to þare seis call, That befor him exilit was Throu erratikis and but trespass. To þat he assentit sone, And has þe papis bidding done; The kirkis þat held of hethin fay All he restorit to Cristin lay. Theodorik þe king forthy Wrait till him dispituously To thai erratikis to restore All þare kirkis as befor, And or ellis wit he witterly He suld haif fra him Ytaly, And Cristin men all suld he sla That he mycht in his raik ourta. Quhen þis gud Iustinus emperoure His chargis had herd and his errour, Thoucht he in hert wes movit þen, For pete ?it of þe Cristin men, And at the papis thra prayere, He maid sobere and wiss ansuere; Bot or þe ansuere come agane, In teyne þis tyrand gert be slane Boycius and seire Cristin men, As he in ire wes werdand þen. And efter þis pape Ornisda The first Iohne sat ?eris twa. This tyrand, of quham eire spak we, Tuke þis pape in his cruelte, And put him in presoune to pyne; To Constantinople he send him syne. Thare Iustinus þe emperour Ressauit him with full gret honour, And with gret powere send him fre Hame to Rome till his awne se. Bot throu þis tyrand ?it neuerþeles Lang efter þat he takin wes And done in till a deip dungeoun; Thare deit þis pape in þat presoune. Sone efter þis tyrand tuke þe deid, And wes condampnyt but remeid, A haly armyt wonnyt neire by, That led his lif religiously, Saw þe saull of this tyrand Put in þe pape [Iohnis] hand, And hastely he kest it doune In Hulkanys hoill caldroune, Quhare Balialis barnis ar bul?eit And tyrandis with tormentis ar tul?eit. Sanct Bryde þat tyme in Irland Wes in her flouris and in Scotland. All France þat tyme tuke Cristin fay, And þat treuth weill held efter ay; And in þat tyme þe gret bewte Off Antioche, þe riche cete, Sodanely wes slongin doune Be erding cruell and felloune. [Sanct] Genowif, the madyne fre, Than in hir virginite Liffit that tyme in Pariss, And in college place þare lyiss Off Blak Channonis regulare; Deuotly scho is honorit thare. And quhen þis first pape Iohne wes dede, Felix þe ferd sat in his steid; Syne þe secund Bonyface Successour neist till him was; Sex ?eris in till þare live Were papis ilk ane successive, And Iustyne ane emperour Neist to Iustyne successour Efter þe secund Bonyface Iohne þe secund twa ?ere wes Pap of Rome; quhen he wes dede, Agapitus sat in þat steid Ten monethis; syne Silueryus; Neist till him Vigilyus Sevintene ?eris held þat se. In till his tyme ordanit he That in þe este end ilk day Off þe kirk þe mess to say. Than in a cete of Ce?ile Thare wes a clerk callit Theophill, That feld him grevit wrangwisly Be his bischop, and thocht forthy In his felony and teyne That he revengeit suld of him bene; And on þat purposs he set him þan For to becum þe deuillis man. And þare apone his procuratour A Iow he maid and mediatour, And þare apon a trist he set; The deuill and he togidder met, And þare in to þe first band That wes maid of þare cunnand, His Cristindome þe clerk forsuke, And to þe deuill þare he him tuke; And of þis felloune permissioun He wrait his obligatioun, And selit it with his awne hand, To hald þis hecht and þis cunnand. Sone efter all þire cunnandis maid This clerk in hert gret sorow had That he sa vnhappely Had forsakin God and Mary. Than fell he in to gret langour, And in saire murnyng and doloure; Than till a chapell neire þare by, That hallowit wes of our Lady, He baid in fasting and waiking, In contritioun and thra praying, Befor ane ymage of oure Lady, And þare he askit hir mercy, Till at oure Lady at þe last Apperit, and him reprevit fast Off his vnskilfull wantones, And of his rude vncunnandnes, That put his saull in sic perill. And þis ilk clerk Theophill With gret repentens askit mercy, And þarto grantit myld Mary; And þare scho gert þe fend appeire, And repruffit him of his manere, That he him set ay to confound Cristin men and bring to ground, And is about ay to suppriss That maid hir or hir sone seruice. And syne scho gert him þare restore The obligatioun þat before He had gottin of þat clerk Quhen he begouth þat wickit werk, And forgaif all wes gane by, And tuke him till hir sonnys mercy, And purchest him thare forgifnes Off all his synnis, mare and less. And efter þat all þis wes done, This Theophill, but langere hone, His way vnto the bischop past, And askit mercy at him fast, And rehersit all þe process, And optenit þare forgifness, And prechit oure all opinly This myrakle of oure sueit Lady, And maid hir gud seruice fra þan, And deit efter gud Cristin man. This paip of Rome Vigilius Wes archidene to Siluerius, His predecessour immediat, And all tyme ?arnyt the paipis stait, And in till þat hie cuvatiss He enerdit till ane emprise, Theodora callit be name, A wickit woman of felloune fame. For þis Silueryus þe pape Wald nocht restore a fals bischape, That wes condampnyt for errasy, Till his bischoprik, forthy This carling gert þe paip be drawin With horse and banyst fra his awne, Fra Rome and in till exile be Throu hir felloune iniquite. Thus deit þis pape in þat exile; Till him succedit þis Vigill, And for þat ilk causs efter he This emprice syne gert takin be, And put about his nek a raip, And gert be put to deid this paip; And þus throu hir iniquite To dede scho gert twa paipis be, And set at þis pape Vigill Enterit in þat stait throu gile, Stedfast he wes in Cristin fay, And deit in repentans verray. To þire sex papis contemporane Emperour wes Iustynyane. The pape Agapitus be preching Drew him fra erratikis fals teching. He abrogit þan þe lawis That þai of Rome held in auld dawis; The Coide and þe Digest rycht weill Till end he furtherit ilk deill, The quhilkis ar bukis of Ciuile, Haldin solempne, gud and subtile. In till his tyme all halely The landis of Perss and of Medy He wan agane to þe empyre, And þar of wes baith lord and syre; To mak lawis he set his entent, And thame to hald wes diligent. Efter þat he had wonnyng Perss, As ?e befor þis herd reherss, All Affrik he wan of weire, And maid it to Rome tributeire. The stait encressit of þe empyre, Till he þar of wes lord and syre. Bot in his tyme fell sodanely A huge hungere in Italy, That þe moderis, for falt of meit, Thare childer wald for hungere eit. In Constantinoplis cete Thare fell a gret mortalite; For þat causs with deuocioun Wes maid þe Purificatioun Off oure Lady for to be Done with all solempnyte, As ?e se ?it ilk ?ere Vsit and haldin vp þe manere. Thre titillis materiall Is of þat fest; þe principall Is Purificatioun of Mary, That menys clengeing properly Off women, efter at þai haif borne The byrth þat þai were with beforne. The purificatioun full meikly Resauit þare oure deire Lady; Bot of it had scho na neid, For scho consauit but manis seid, And efter þe bergh at scho had borne Scho wes clene madin as beforne. The vertu of þe Haly Gaist Maid þat may of mychtis mast Gret wambe with child, and borne wes he Vnfylit hir virginite; All quyte and fre sa scho wes Fra þat auld law of Moyses; Bot nocht forthy it wes hir will The law in all thingis to fulfill, Sen scho him baire of hir body That come þe law to keip fully. The secund titill principall As to þis matere festiuall Is callit Vpopanti Domini, That menys meting properly One Inglis toung, as for to say; For in þe Temple on þat day Symeon met his Saluiour, That him baid and his succour, And in his armys þat ald man Him tuke and said þir wordis þan: Nunc dimittis, Domine, Seruum tuum in pace, That is to say, Lord, þov leiffis me Now in rest and in pece to be. The thrid titill is Candilmes, That first begouth in hethnes, Or thai of Rome tuke Cristin fay; For steidfast in na treuth were þai, Bot in fretys and in reveryis Makand to mawmentis sacrifyiss, And myskennand thare creature, And lovand ma goddis þan nature Or ony vertu mycht compriss Be wit or ressoune to deviss. For god of wyne þai callit Bachus. And of wynd þai callit Eolus, And Mars þai callit god of batall, Bot in na thing mycht he availl; Neptune þai callit god of se, Bot saull na lif nouþer had he. To þire thai vsit to mak seruice Than wes þare vse and þare manere, The formast nycht of Februare, With blesis brycht and gret tortyss, Singand and dansand on þar wiss, About þe cete for to ga In honour of dame Februa; For þai said at scho moder was Off Mars and a gret goddes. And wes þare vthere ma That sa [did] for dame Serpina, That þai affermyt [moder] wes Off Pluto, and a hie goddes. And sum said Pluto wes sa fell That þai him callit a god of hell; Bot efter þat, quhen Cristin fay Lichtnyt þan in treuth verray, Set it wes hard for to forbeire, As commone sayis, a wount manere, Pellagyus, a pape of Rome, In bettyre changeit þat custome. Throu his decrete he ordanit þan That all manere of Cristin man Suld bring candillis birnand cleire Within þe kirk of faire manere, And at þe mess in to thare hand, Syne gif þai vp in till offerand The secund day of Februare, In honour of þat madin cleire That wes kirkit as þat day, Moder of God and man verray; And fra þin furth Candilmes Off þat fest þe titill is. And ?it as to þir titillis thre Mony thingis may liknyt be To be said to þis matere, That I leif now to writt in heire. Sanct Benet þe haly man Wes in þat samyn tyme liffand þan, And in to France Sanct Maure he send The Cristin treuth for to mak kend. Thare Sanct Benet gert cast doune Kuchlis þat for deuocioun Commonis vsit on þar wiss In loving of þare mawmentriss. Off þe tempill of Appollyne He hallowit a kirk of Sanct Martyne, And of Sanct Iohne þe Baptist he Ane altere als gert hallowit be. This Sanct Benet for vertuouse seire That men saw in till him appeire Wes recommendit commonaly For man inspyrit of prophecy; For to prufe gif it wes sa The king of Gotis, Totila, Cled a rebald in clething As efferis vntill a king, And bad him syne at he suld pass To þat place quhare Sanct Benet was, And say þat he wes Tutila, That come till him his schrift to ma. Apon his way þis man held fast With twa carlis þat with him past To se and for to beire witnes Gif Sanct Benet inspyrit wes. And quhen Sanct Benet him saw sa neire That he mycht weill his wordis heire: “Put of, put of,” he said, “leif sone, The clething on þi body done; For to me it is rycht weill knawin That þai claithis ar nocht þin awin; Sone, efferis nocht to þe Proudare þan þi stait to be.” At þire wordis þai thre men Sa gretly wer abaisit then That þai fell and askit mercy, And syne went hame agane in hy, And tald þe king withoutin hone But fen?eing all how þai had done. And Totila þis king past þan To Sanct Benet þat haly man, That snybbit þis king of his syne, And to do mare þat wald nocht blyn, And counsalit him on all manere His synnis at he suld forbeire. “Nyne ?eris king ?it sall þov be, And efter þat pass oure þe se; The tend ?ere þov salbe slane.” Thare of þe king wes na thing fayne, Bot neuerþeles ?it þan it fell As Sanct Benet couþ him tell. Fra þat king past oure þe se, In weris þat ix. ?eris wes he, And in þe x. ?ere agane come And wan of forss þe tovne of Rome, And all the landis of Italy Obeyit til his sen?eory. And for þat causs þe emperour, To saif his stait and his honour, He send Schir Narses to þat land, And maid him þare his luftennand, Agane king Totila to weire With his oste and his powere, That put the Gotis of Ytaly, And tuke þar king dispitously And slew him þare and vþer ma; The prophacy fulfillit wes sa Off Sanct Benet þe haly man. And þus of weire þe land he wan, And wes þare to þe emperoure Off all þat land his procuratour. This Narses wes a noble knycht, And in till weire hardy and wycht; He wes of natioun a Romane, And of liffing a noble man; He wan maire worschip and renovne With prayeris and deuocioun Than he did oft throu forse of fycht, Throu press or powere or throu mycht, For þare wes na thing in to deid In all his tyme agane him ?eid. Quhen Pelagyus þe pape wes dede, The thrid Iohne xii. ?ere in his steid Sat, xi. monethis and twenty And vii. dais þar to fully. Sant Maure deit in his dais, And lyis neire Pariss, as men sais. The secund Iustyne emperoure, To the first Iustyne successour, Xi. ?eris lord and syre Held þe stait of þe empyre. The emprice his wif, a lady That be name wes callit dame Sophy, Dispituouse and rycht fell scho wes To þis gud knycht Schir Narses, That, as I said, wes procuratour Till hir lord þe emperoure Off all þe landis of Italy And Calabere, Poill and Lumbardy. Scho gert þat knycht accusit be Off gret and fell iniquite Befor hir lord þe emperour, And said he excedit mesoure Off euill and rude extorsionis And grevous impositionis. Off þis scho maid sa gret deray That scho gert all þe Romanis say That þame had bene better all wyss Till haue [bene] vnder þe seruice Off þe Gotis þan for to be Wnder that geldingis cruelte; Scho callit þat gud knycht a gelding, For he wes chaist in his liffing. And þare þis gud knycht Schir Narses Throu hir invy accusit wes, And deprivit of his office Throu thranes of þat fell emprice; And þis secund Iustyne emperoure Put þat gud knycht fra his honour, That befor þat mony wiss Had maid him lele and gud seruiss. And þus, quhen he wes fra his stait Removit, þis emprice till him wrait, And said at scho wald gif him fee, To Constantinople gif þat he Wald cum, and trewly till hir hecht That he be mesoure and evin wecht Wald tak hir tow and ?arne to spyn, And ?arne sa sponyng to gif in. He wrait agane till hir in hy, And said he hecht hir sickerly That to that webe that scho suld weif Baith tow and ?arne he suld hir reif, And sic a pryne he suld hir wynd That þare suld litill leif behynd Off warp or weft to mak hir claith, Set scho and all hir kyn were wraith. With þat he past in Pannony, That merchand is with Wngary; And þare with Lumbardis in þat quhile That þare were flemyt in exile, With þare king Arbour sickerly He maid a band of cumpany; With þe Lumbardis agane he come, And wan of forse the toune of Rome, Till Tuskane and Ytaly, Almayne and all Lumbardy He wan and drew fra þe empyre, And of þaim maid baith lord and syre This Schir Arbour, þat þan wes king And Lumbardis had in gouernyng. And þus þai twa in þare lif, And all þare airis successive, Held all þai landis in heretage To þame and þairis and þare lynage Fra þe empyre twa hundreth ?ere And ma, gif all weill reknyt were, Ay till þe king of France Pypyne, With þe emperoure Constantyne, Raiss and wan with þare powere Agane þai landis all of weire, As ?e sall heire efter þis sone Quhen all þe laif till it is done. Lo! heire a worthy wif to waill, All suld þe deuill haif delt his daill, Set vp hir quheill and lat hir spyne, Scho can bring but at wes brocht in. Spend but sparing mycht hir spouss Sa suld a huss that brocht till houss; He spurnyt oftare þan he sped That sic a blosome brocht to bed. For þus þis emperour oure lichtly [Tynt] throu a wif all Ytaly With oþer sindry landis seire That I befor þis reknyt heire; Bot he mycht weill better haif done To do as Catone kend his sone: “[Traw] nocht thi wif on thi seruand Quhen scho is wantonly wrythand; For wiffis oft hatis on gret manere Him þat hir husband is deire.” Sanct Brendane in þat samyn quhile Travalit on se fra ile to ile. Sanct Colme þat tyme out of Irland Come and prechit in to Scotland. Brud-Mathonysone, þe king þan Off Pightis, he maid Cristin man, And baptist him in to þat quhile, And gert him [trow] in þe Ewangile, Five hundreth five and sexty ?ere Efter þe birgh of our Lord deire, Quhen ?oungare Iustyne wes emperour And held xi. ?ere þat honour, The x. ?ere efter þis Brude king, And had þe Pightis in gouernyng. Gerneth-Makdonald nixt him syne Wes king and foundit Abernethyne And Stratherne in þat ilk tyde, In to þe honour of Sanct Bryde. The first tyme may be notit heire Quhen þe Pightis conuertit were. Neist oure the Pightis regnyt þen The king Kennell-Makdulghen; And efter þat his dais were done King wes Nectane Fodis sone. Brude, Galiarge and Galargane, Neist efter þis king Nectane, Ilkane till vthere in thare live Twenty ?eris were successive. Gernath-Donagh and Durst his broþer, Brude-Belisone, befor oþer Kingis were in to Scotland Oure þe Pightis þan regnand; And of Ykolmkill þan Abbot wes Sanct Adaman. And quhen þis thrid Iohne wes deid Sanct Serve sevin ?eris held þat steid. He wes of lif a haly man, The kingis sone of Chanaane. His fader land of heretage Fell till him be evin lynnage, And lauchtfully befor all othire; He gaif it till his ?oungare brother. All sic cumber he forsuke, And till haly lif him tuke. God send him a gud angell To gif him comfort and counsell, And with þat angell als fast First till Alexander he past; Till Constantinople syne he come, And fra þin he held to Rome. Thare þan vaikit þe papis se, And chosin till it þan wes he. Than gouernyt it he vii. ?ere; And quhen vii. ?eris passit were, The angell, þat his ledare wes, Said him behuffit fra Rome to pass, For God ordanit nocht at he Langare in þat land suld be. Than on a hie solempnyt day, Or he begouth to tak his way, He maid a predicatioun And a solempnyt suete sermone To þe Romanis, at he gert call Befor him, and at þaim all He tuke his leif but mare delay; And with þare blessing went his way With þe angell, þat throu chance Led him throu the realme of France, Straucht to þe se departand Off France þe kinrik and Ingland. Schipping þare he gat redy, With him a hundreth in cumpany; In þai schippis he maid entre, Syne tuke vp saill and held þe se. With wynd at will ay on thai past Quhill thai in Forth come at þe last, And aryvit in Inchekeith, A crag betuix Kingorne and Leith. Off Ycolmkill þe abbot þan, Sanct Adaman, a haly man, Come till him þare, and fermely Maid speciall band of cumpany, And tretit him to cum in Fife And þare for to drive oure his lif. Than to Desert of his men?e Throu Adamanys counsall send he; Syne at Kynneill he come to land. Thare oure þe watter he kest his wand, That sodanely grew till a tre, And baire of apillis gret plente; And that steid efter þat ay Morglass wes callit mony day. Than oure þe watter on purposs Off Forth he past to Culross; Thare he begouth to red þat ground; A noble kirk þare can he found, And efter it wes maid ane abbay Off quhit monkis, the suth to say; And in þat abbay forsuth he lyis, His spirit in till Paradiss. Brude Darguardis sone in to Scotland Wes oure þe Pightis þan regnand; He muffit wes in cruelte Agane Sanct Serve and his men?e, And send furth felloune men forthy To sla þaim all doune but mercy; Bot þan þat king oure takin wes All sodanely with fell seiknes, And at þe prayere speciall Off Sanct Serve he wes maid haill. That [king] fell fra his first purposs, And gaif to Sanct Serve all Culross, With alkin profettis properly; And till his prayeris deuotly He him commendit and his stait, And repentit him of his debait, And resauit with honeste Sanct Serve þare and his men?e. Thare first Sanct Serve tuke his resset To leif on it at he may get, And þare fosterit Sanct Mwngw, That syne wes bischop of Glasgw. Than fra Culross he passit evin To þe Inche within Lochlevin. This king Brude of deuotioun Maid to Sanct Serve donatioun Off that Inche, and he duelt þare Till vii. ?eris oure passit ware. In Tulybody ane euill spirit A Cristin man þat tyme taryit; Bot of þat spirit he wes þan Deliuerit throu þis haly man. Twa sonnys he rasit fra dede to lif In Tulycultyr till a wif. This haly man had als a ram, That he had fed vp of a lam, And vsit him to follow ay Quhare euer he went be streit or way. This scheip a theif prevely stall, And eit him vp efter þat all; And sone Sanct Serve his rame myst, Bot quha him stall wes few þat wyst; Bot of presumptioun neuerþeles He þat him stall arrestit wes, And till Sanct Serf þare wes he brocht. Than he said he stall him nocht, And þare to for to sueire ane aith He said at he wald nocht be laith; Bot son he worthit reid for schame, For þare þe rame bletit in his wame. Sa wes he tayntit schamefully, And at Sanct Serf askit mercy. Syne efter þat throu deuocioun He fordid a felloune dragoun, And, quhare he slane wes, þat place ay The dragonys den wes callit to þis day. Quhill Sanct Serf lay in till a steid Efter Matynnis in his bed, The deuill apperit in þat entent That he wald mak him argument, And said: “Serf, I se be thi werk And knawis at þov art a gret clerk.” Sanct Serf said: “Gif I sa be, Foull wreche, quhat is þat for þe?” The deuill said: “Þis questioun I ask as in collacioun; Say, quhare wes God, wait þov oucht, Befor or hevin or erd wes wrocht?” Sanct Serf said: “In him self, but less, His Godheid neuer hamprit wes.” The deuill þan askit quhat causs he had To mak þe creaturis at he maid. To þat ansuerit Sanct Serf thare: “Of creaturis maid he wes makare, And makare mycht he neuer be Bot gif creaturis maid had he.” The deuill askit quhy God of nocht All his werkis gud full wrocht. Sanct Serf ansuerd: “For Goddis will Wes neuer to mak his werkis ill; For invyouse he had bene Gif his werkis ill were sene.” The deuill askit Sanct Serf þan Quhare God maid first Adam. Sanct Serf ansuerd to Sathanas: “In Ebrone Adam first formyt was, And syne translatit to Paradiss; Thare he wes put out for his viss.” The deuill askit how lang he baid In Paradiss fra he wes maid, Or þat he fell in to syne. To þat Sanct Serf ansuerit him, And said he wes bot houris sevin In it or he brak bidding evin. “Quhare wes Eve maid?” said Sathanas. Quod Serf: “In Paradiss maid scho wes.” The deuill at Sanct Serf askit þan Quhy God leit Adam, þe first man, And Eve syne in Paradiss. Quod Serf: “For God on mony wiss Wist full weill and vnderstude That thare of suld cum mekle gud; For Crist tuke flesche mankynd to wyn That throu the feynd fell in to syne.” The deuill askit quhy mycht nocht be Mankynd out deliuerit fre Be þaim self, set God had nocht Thame with his precius passioun bocht. Quod Sanct Serf: “For thai fell nocht in Be þaim self in to syne, Bot be fals suggestioun Off ?ow, feynd sa felloune; Forthy he chesit to be borne To sauf mankynd at wes forlorne.” The deuill askit at him þan Quhy wald nocht God mak a new man Mankynd for to deliuer fre. Sanct Serf said: “Þat nedit nocht to be; For it suffice þat of mankynd Ane suld cum of Adammys strynd, That suld redeme mankynd fra hell, And ?e in payne þare euer to duell; For throu ?our awne iniquite ?e fell,” quod Serf, “sa did nocht we, And for ?e, feyndis, were nocht wrocht Off brukill kynd, ?it wald ?e nocht With repentens forthink ?our syne, That ?e throu pryde wes fallyn in; Forthy Cristis deire passioun Suld nocht be to ?ow redemptioun.” Than þe deuill saw þat he couþ nocht, For all þe wylis at he mocht, Oure cum Sanct Serf, and said þare þan That he him knew for a wiss man; Forthy rycht þare he gaif him quyte, For he fand with him na proffit. Than Sanct Serf said: “False wreche, thov ga Out of þis steid, and noy na ma In to þis place, I command þe.” Than sodanely away wit he Out of þat steid, and fra þat day He wes neuer sene, þe suth to say. Efter all þis þis Sanct Serf past West to Culross als fast, And be his stature quhen he knew That till his ending neire he drew, This wretchit warld all he forsuke, And syne his sacrament he tuke With schrift and gud contritioun, And ?ald with gud deuocioun His corps till haly sepulture, His spirit till his Creature. Brude Dargardis sone deit þan; His broþer regnyt efter him Nectane; Odufe Frudsone, syne Alphyne, Brude Maktenagus regnyt syne. Efter þat all thire regnyt thus Apyne raiss Nectenegus, Drust Maktagart nixt him þan; Efter him regnyt Calargane. CHAPTER XCVIII. Off Tyberius þe trew emperoure, And how Crist ekit his tresour. Sone efter þat Sanct Serf wes past Fra Rome, þe first Benet als fast Tuke and held twa ?eris þat se, And nixt efter quhen dede wes he Secund Pelagyus ?eris five Led in to þat stait his live. In till his tyme gret ranys fell With wickit wyndis scharp and snell, That throu spatis Tiber flude The wallis of Rome all oure ?ude. Gret hie houssis it kest doune, And drovnit mony within þe tovne Off men and women and barnis baith. In Rome þat rane did mekle scaith, And serpentis gret and a dragoun Distrublit all þat regioun; For quhare þai bestis dede were left, With stynk þe aire wes trublit eft That sic ane huge mortalite Quhare with wastit wes þe cete. The pape Pelagius deit þan, And till him contemporane Tiberius wes emperoure, And held sevin winter þat honour. He wes rycht gud Cristin man; The tresoure of þe empyre þan He delt to pure folkis largely. The emprice his wif for þi Repruffit and callit him a waistour, That sa distroyit þe tresoure Off þe empyre, quharfor þat he Off law aucht to deprivit be Off his estate; and he agane Said he deseruit nocht sic payne, For he thocht to haif better reward Off God, at wes his souerane lard, The quhilk mycht gere þe tresoure be All tyme haboundand in plente; For quhy þe tresoure gevin thare Wes delt to þaim þat had mystare, That he wes dettyt to succoure Off þat at he wes procuratour. And as he a day gangand was Within þe chalmer of his palace, Vnderneith his feit he saw, Gravin in to the marbill law, Off þe corss a takin, weill Portrayid all at point ilk deill. He said þat takin men suld set In to þe hycht of þare foret, And suld nocht ly in sa law steid Quhare men with feit mycht on it tred. Forthy rycht þan in gud entent He gert men tak vp þat pathment, And quhen þat he had sagatis done, That ilk takin he saw sone Lyand layth vnder that place Quhare the first corss lyand wes, Like to þe first in all degre. That als he gert vptakin be, And vndere þat the thrid he saw, And þat alssone he gert vp draw, And laygh vnderneth þe thrid He fand a hwrd of fyne gold hyd. Tharewith he ekit þe tresore That he in almouss gaif before, And foundit abbais als religiouss And did gret dedis of almouss. CHAPTER XCIX. Off Sanct Gregour þe gret doctour, And of Heraclius þe emperour. Efter þat Ihesu Crist wes borne To sauf þare saullis at wes forlorne Five hundreth winter and nynty And twa reknyt fullely, Eftere Pelagyus syne Gregoure, That wes þe gret solempne doctour, Pape of Rome wes xiii. ?ere Sex monethis and x. dais cleire. He maid mony omelyis, The quhilkis declaris on quhat wyss Men suld þe Ewangelis vnderstand; And þare with als he tuke on hand For to expound full opinly E?ichelis prophacy. The buke of Iob he tretit haill In clerklike manere and morall, For till vnderstand opinly The wordis at Iob spak mystely. Off þe Pasche candill þe hallowing he Dytit and syne gert songin be, The quhilk on Pasche evin ilk ?ere ?it is vsit the manere, The Diologe and þe Registere, And vthere mony bukis ma þan thire, That now may nocht all reknyt be. And Traianys saull redemyt he Fra perpetuall pane of hell, As forouth þis ?e haif herd tell. And in þe tyme þat he wes pape He send in Ingland a bischap, Sanct Austyne callit be name, And with him monkis of gud fame, The Cristin treuth þare for to preche, And þe Saxonis for to teche To resaif and keip þat fay That suld thare saullis sauf for ay. Thus he conuertit first Ingland, That in wan treuth wes blynd lyand, Fra Saxonis had wonnyng fre To þare nacionis þat cuntre. The king of Brettane Lucyus Wrait till Eleutherius, That in his tyme wes paip of Rome, And said he wald tak Cristindome, Baith he and all his nacioun, In hope of þare saluacioun. This pape send twa clerkis þan, And thaim conuertit of Brettane A hundreth twa and sexty ?ere Efter þe birth of oure Lord deire. And þat fay þe Brettonys held clene A hundreth winter and sextene, Ay till Dioclesiane And his fallow Maximiane Tuke þe stait of the empyre, And Cristin folkis [slew] in thare ire. And efter þat a hundreth ?ere And thre and sevinty passit cleire The Brettonys held that fay but dout Ay till þe Saxonys put þaim out; And sa, fra þat þe Saxonis [blude] Ingland throu þare mycht our ?ude, Thai resauit na Cristindome Till Sanct Gregoure wes pape of Rome, Foure hundreth ?eris nynty and sevin Efter þe birgh of God of Hevin. Sa þe Saxonis in Ingland In fals errour were lyand A hundreth sevin and fourty ?ere Fra þai in þe land cummyn were, Till þe tyme of Sanct Gregore, As ?e herd rehersit befor. Fra he conuertit had þat land, Appostill þai callit him of Ingland; For þat office he did weill In þare conuerting ilk deill. Sanct Austyne gert þaim of Ingland The rewill of Pasche wele vnderstand, That forouth þat þai had in weire Till he it maid to þaim cleire. And in this ilk tyme Sanct Mungow Wes bischop liffand in Glasgow. In Iosophat, neire Ierusalem, Cristis cote nocht sewit wiþ seme Wes funding, as Frere Martyne sais, And to Ierusalem in þai dais Wes brocht, and in a coffyre closit, And for a relike wes reposit. And Mauryce þat tyme lord and syre Wes xx. winter of þe empyre; He wan baith Perss and Armeny, And gouernyt his empyre vertuously. He [dowtit] God on gret manere, And askit all tyme in his prayere That he suld nocht dee befor Or he had tholit his purgatore. Than in þe hicht above his ?et In a faire stage he gert be set Ane ymage of þe Trinite, That men gret plesance had to se, For richt perfitly maid it wes And rycht weill polist all of brass. In till his sleip apon a nycht Doune he saw that ymage lycht, And tuke his seat in a chaare, And as a iuge him semyt thare. Off hevinly spiritis, brycht and gud, Him thocht he saw gret multitud; And sone þe iuge bad ane call That emperour befor þaim all. Quhen he apperit þe Trinite Bad him cheiss him quheþer þat he Wald suffer in þis warld, befor Or he deit, his purgatore, Or byde efter þat he were went Goddis rychtuiss iugement, Fra his saull were frely Departit fra þe body. And quhen þe iuge apon þis wiss Had said, þan þe emperour Mawriss Said: “Lord God, þat schawis þe Liffand man like in all degre, Thow grant me in this warld, befor Or that I dee, my purgatore.” Till Fokas þan þe Trinite Bad he suld deliuerit be. Out of his sleip quhen he wes brocht Off þis dreme he had gret thocht; Sa had he a speciall man, That be name hecht Phillip þan; He sperit at him gif a knycht wes In all his court þat hecht Fokas. “?e,” he said, “I ken þat knycht, Off weire a manly man and wycht, And licht of all condicioun, And till all folyis redy boune. The emperour þan petuously Tald to Phillip opinly All þe dremys and his visioun, And for his purgatory maid him bovne. Sa fell it efter þat of weire The emperour past with gret powere Oure all his oste, and þaim gert he cry That na man suld be sa hardy Ony gudis but price to ta, And redy payment for to ma. And for þe emperour in that weire Gaif þaim na wage, as he did eire, Thai tuke and payit nocht reddely; And þe wageouris forthy Murmurit and spak to Schir Fokas, That he be þaim sa sterit was That thai him held as emperour, And he till him tuke þe honour Off þe empyre, and þan Mauriss Saw his stait turnyt on þis wiss; Till a wod neire by he fled, And hid him in a preve steid With his childer and his wif; Thare fell þe ending of his lif; For he wes slane throu fell purches Throu his successour Schir Fokas, And þus his purgatory heire he had Off quhilk þe Trinite him warnyng maid. Neist Sanct Gregoure, Fabiane Wes pape of Rome na ?ere bot ane. Till him þe thrid Bonyface Pape of Rome aucht monethis was. The ferd Bonyface, quhen þat he Wes dede, sex winter held þat se. And þan this Fokas, lord and syre, Held þe stait of þe empyre, And gaif þan to þis Bonyface Panteone, at that tyme was Off Rome þe gretest tempill maid That þe Romanis in honour had Off all þair mawmentis halely; And of ane alsua specially Ane ymage in cheif þai set, Off Romulus þe mawment grete. And in þat tempill stude him by Off ilk mawment sindrely Maid and payntit ane ymage Off ilk Rome þat aucht homage Or tribut to þe tovne of Rome; And quhen ony cuntre had mysdone, Or wald agane þe Romanis ryss, Than wald thare mawment on þat wyss, Throu þe feyndis cast and slycht, Turne his bak apon þaim rycht Quhare befor turnyt wes his face, To þat land þat his folkis was, Or ellis apon Romule þat mawment; And sa þe Romanis be þat entent With þat cuntre wald conspyre Agane þe stait of þe empyre, Be takin þat that ymage Fra þame or Romule turnyt þe visage, And on þame þan wald set his bak; And be þat counsell wald þai tak And gader oste and gret powere, And on þat cuntre mufe þare weire. And quhen þis tempill Panteone was Gevin þare to pape Bonyface, He gert fordo þat mawmentry, And in þe honour of oure Lady, And of all hallowis in till hevin A kirk he hallowit of it full evin, And clengeit it of all devilry That Romanis honorit opinly; And þus þe first mater wes Off þe fest of Alhallomes. Efter þe dede of þis Fokas Eraclyus with his sone [was], That Constantyne syne hecht be name, Baith mychti men and of gret fame, Emperouris baith successive, And xxx. ?eris in þare live That gouernyt þat stait stoutly, And gert þe Iowis deuotly Be turnyt till Cristin fay, And erratikis weill dantit þai. Quhen þis Eraclyus, lord and syre, Held þe stait of þe empyre, Cosdre, þan a felloune king That Perss had þan in gouernyng, Set him to waist halely [Than þ]e landis of Iowry. Ierusalem, and vther seire Placis þat in gret worschip were, This Cosdre brynt vp in his ire, And distroyit þaim with felloune fyre, And had with him þe croce away That Crist deit on vpon Gud Fryday, And with him brocht it in to Perss. And þis Eraclyus, to reherss, Slew þis tyrand manfully, And sua deliuerit he frely His captiffis that in his presoune Lay, and with deuocioun That haly croce he brocht away, In loving of þe Cristin fay. And in þis ilk tyme Machemete, That wes þe Sara?enis mast prophet, Raiss and grew to stait and hicht, And wes a man of selcouth slicht. Oft he tuke þe falland ill, And quhen þat access come him till, Quhen he wes as deid lyand, Than wald þai say he wes slepand Or spekand with an angell þan. Thus þai wend, baith wif and man, And þat angell, þai said, him tald Off all thingis þat he wit wald, And þan all thingis þat he wald say Suld fall efter þat he seik sa lay, Throu þe deuillis procuratioun, That held þaim in þat dampnatioun. The Exaltatioun festuall Off þe Cross, now vsuall, Wes drawn and tane of þat story, And vsit is sen syne suthly. Off Eraclyus victoryis And of þis Cosdreis tyrandriss Men may fynd in þe Legend Off Sanctis, quha his wit will spend. Quhen deid wes þe ferd Bonyface, Till him succedit Anastace; Five ?eris of Rome pape wes he Nyne monethis and dayis thre. Nixt him the fyft Bonyface, And vthere five ?eris pape he was. The first Honoryus and Seweryne, Iohne and Theodoricus syne, Off Rome were papis in þare live, Ilk ane till vthire successive. And to þire papis all tyme þan Heraclyus contemporane Wes haill lord and emperoure, And held þat stait in gret honour. Quhen þis Eraclyus wes dede, Constantyne in till his steid, His sone, haill emperour wes, A man all gevin to wickitnes. And Martyne wes paip þan Off Rome, till him contemporane, And sex ?eris he held þat se, And haly man of lif wes he. Apone a day, quhen at he wes Buskand for to say his mess, A felloune man by him standand His suerd to sla him wes drawand, Bot þat man blind wes sodanely, And cryit on kneis him mercy, And confessit his trespas, And quham throu at he errit was. This emperour efter Constantyne Gert sla þis haly paip Martyne, Becauss he pvnyst errasyis That he fauorit mony wiss. Syne with his awne slane wes he For his felloune iniquite, And þai þat put him to þe dede Tuke vp ane oþer in his steid, Merencius, a manfull knycht, Bot þat stait fell nocht be rycht Till him; for Constantyne trewly His sone, þat slane wes fellonly, And of his fader had þe name, A manly knycht and of gud fame, Fra Constantynople sodanely Be navyne to Rome he come forthy, And slew þis Merencius in fecht, And syne all þaim to deid he dicht That had his fader put to deid, And raiss syne in his faderis steid, Lord of þe empyre alhaill, And gouernyt it stoutly, but faill. And quhen þis pape Martyne wes dede Eugenyus twa ?eris held that steid, And neist hand him Vicalyane Xxx. ?eris wes paip and ane, And syne wes other papis seire That spedis nocht to rekin heire. Constantyne þe ferd þan, And efter him Iustynyane, Emperouris were successive, Ilk ane till vthire in þare live. The secund Leo x. ?ere And thare to x. dais cleire In Rome held þe papis se; And at þe mess þan ordanit he Agnus Dei þat we suld say, And pax efter þat to be gevin ay. And quhen þat þis Leo wes deid Benet sat in till his steid, Iohne þe thrid and syne Conane; Sargyus nixt tham on ane Nyne ?eris wes paip of Rome And kepare of all Cristindome. Iustynyane þe secund þan Wes emperour contemporane. Neste to þis pape Sargyis Iohne and syne Sysynnyus, Constantyne and Gregour eft Ilk ane till vthire papis left. Constantyne and Iustynyane, Leo and Tyberius þan, Iustynyane and Phillippus, Anastas and Theodosyus Lordis ware of þe empyre; Bot of þaim mast lord and syre Wes þis Leo of felloune will, And in his tyme did mekle ill. Off haly sanctis þe ymage he Brynt in till a fyre gert be; The secund Gregour paip forthy Cursit him solemply. The duke of Fresland wes nocht þan Cristin, bot wes hethin man; Bot of a Cristin bischop by [Tretit] þare to he wes thraly Off bapteme, with trew entent To tak þe haly sacrament; To þis he tretit wes sa fast That he consentit at þe last. The bischop and he þan in hy To þe kirk passit bodely, Quhare þe font wes haly sone. The duke fra him his clathis has done; Quhen he his a fut had put in, Than askit he þare of his kyne Quheþer ma in hell wes or in hevin; And þai him ansuerd þare to evin And said at þare were ma in hell. Than chesit he erare to duell With þaim; for he doutit to be Repruffit of vnkyndnes gif he Suld withdraw him, gif he were dede, Fra his kyne till ane vncouth steid, Till strangearis fra his awne kyth, Quham he wes fosterit and brocht vp with, Quhare neuer nane wes of his kyn, Auld na ?oung, na mare na myn; He said he wald nocht beire þat blame. “Abrenuncio,” he said, “for schame.” With þat out of þe font he tuke His fute, and haly þare forsuke Cristindome for euer to ta, For with his freyndis he wald ga With þaim fynaly to duell Evire mare in þe pyne of hell. Sevin hundreth winter and sextene Fra lichtare wes þe Virgin clene Pape of Rome wes þan Gregore The secund, as ?e herd befor, And Anastas þan emperour, The first ?ere of þis honour, Nectane Derlyne þan regnand Oure þe Pightis in Scotland. In Ross he foundit Rossmarkyne, That dowit wes with kingis syne, And wes maid a place cathedrall A north half Murray seuerall; Thire channonis seruice seculare And of Sanct Bonyface hallowit ware. The tyme of þat foundatioun Wes efter þe Incarnatioun To be comptit sex hundreth ?ere, Quheþer mare or less, or þare by neire, Quhen Schir Mawriss wes emperour, And held þat stait in gret honour. CHAPTER C. The auctour ferlyis þat of þe Pightis Remanit noþer langage nor richtis. Clerkis sayis þat prolixite, That langsumnes may callit be, Generis leth mare þan delite. Off þis tretiss for thy þe dite Is drawin in all distinctioun; As eftere þe desensioun That betuix þe Scottis fell And þe Pightis rycht cruell, That put þe Pightis out of þe land, Quhare in befor þai were duelland A thousand sexty ?eris and ma. Out of Scotland þai were put sa That nouþer remanis of þare lynage, Na ?it na thing of þare langage, The Scottis, foundit of þat rycht, But ony help of outwart mycht, Recouerit sa þare heretage Evire to lest with þare lynage, And oure king till hald his estait Off God him self immediat, And of nane oþer meyne personne. Hald þis for ferme conclusioun; Quha argwiss agane þis wilfully Lat him be ansuerit [listfully]. The Pape oure fader is speciall; Deuote his sonnis we ar haill, And redy all till his bidding In lefull and in honest thing; And ?it weill mare indeferent We are all till him obedient; Sa has oure elderis all tyme bene, Be gret witnes has bene sene Off þame recouerit oure land To þame and þairis throu stalwart hand. It is my purposs now till haist, Throu vertu of þe Haly Gaist, Be verray relacioun, Thare personale successioun, That has ws in þis fredome set; And, were it wilfully for?et, It wald be reput vnkyndnes, And ellis perchans vncunnandnes. CHAPTER CI. How þe pape cursit Leo emperour, That till his ymage did dishonour. Sevin hundreth xx. ?eris and foure Fra borne wes oure Saluioure, And þe tende of þis Gregoure The secund, as ?e herd befor, The nynetene ?ere of þis cursit emperour Leo, þat liffit in fals errour, Oure þe Scottis þe king Ewan, With þe Pightis regnand þen In till þe kinrik of Scotland, Pightis þar in þan wonnand, The stait he gouernyt stoutly. Writtin it is of him for thy In cornykillis þe first wes he That oure þe Scottis had pouste, Quhen þe Pightis were regnand Within þe kinrik of Scotland. Sevin hundreth ?eris fourty and ane Fra Ihesu Crist mankynd had tane, This Ewanys dais were all done. Murthow succedit til him sone, And oure þe Scottis ?eris thre As king þat stait þan gouernyt he. A batall þat tyme wes betuene The Scottis and þe Pightis kene; A hundreth ?eris ?it neuerþeless Efter þat þe Pightis wes Within þe kinrik of Scotland In þare mychtis þan regnand. The thrid Gregour, þat tyme pape And of þe warld þe mast bischap, And þis Leo ?it emperour, Liffand in his fals errour, This pape tretit him besely Till honour ymagis deuotly Off all sanctis in generall; Bot he wald nocht do his counsall, Bot forsuke it aluterly quyte, And did till ymagis gret dispite. The thrid paip forthy Cursit him all opinly, And interditit all trewage Fra him, and tribut and homage Off all þe landis of Ytaly, And of þe empyre halely, And of oþer diuerss nacionis seire That waistit him and his powere; Na he na had in nakyne thing Hap to gracius gouernyng, Bot deit cursit in that honour, And gat na hallowit sepultour. This paip of Rome, þe thrid Gregore, Off quham þat ?e herd befor, Gert a solempne sen?e be sene, Foure hundreth bischopis and xviii., And fere ma prelatis regulare, With mony a gret clerk seculare In till hie solempne greis Avansit in sindry faculteis. Thare þai declarit opinly That all men suld deuotly Do till ymagis all honour, Sen þai schawit þe figoure Off sanctis, þat were ay plesand To God, till þai were qwik liffand, And spendit sa weill þar seruice Thare saulis are now in Paradiss. And quhen þis thrid Gregour wes dede, ?acharias in till his steid Succedit, and in x. winter he Held in Rome the papis se. [Ewen] þe secund in his dais, Murthois sone, þe story sais, Wes oure þe Scottis þan regnand Within the kinrik of Scotland. Sevin hundreth winter and fourty And five to rekin fullely, Sternys in þe aire fleand Wes sene, as flawis of fyre byrnand, The first nycht of Ianuere, All þat nycht oure schynand cleire. CHAPTER CII. Off papis and kingis in þar lif, And alsua of a wickit wif. Sevin hundreth xl. ?eris and nyne Fra lichtare were þe clene Uirgyne, Stevin þe secund þan in live Pape of Rome wes ?eris five. Asculfe þan king of Lumbardy Supprisit þe kirk dispituously. This Stevin þe paip socht succour At Constantyne þe emperour; Bot to þe pape inclynit he nocht, As he of det suld do and mocht, Na for þe kirk maid na defens Nouþer with help na diligens, Na did nocht þe papis desyre As he suld; þare for þe empyre This paip translatit fra Grekis ay, To byde with Almanys fra þat day For euer, and þat translatioun Wes maid in Charlis avne persone, Sevin hundreth five and fifty ?ere Efter þe byrth of oure Lord deire, Quhen þis Charlis wes in ?outhheid, Growand vp to rype manheid. Venerabilem tuichis neire The decretale þis mater, That þe thrid paip Innocent Maid rycht weill in þat entent, To ken princis how þar powste Thai had, and þare auctorite. The oile is hallowit of þe pape, Or vnder him of a bischap, Quhare with kingis and emperouris Ar vntit, takand þare honouris, Thare ring, þare ceptour and þare crovne, With haly prayere and orysoune Off bischopis ar deuotly blest, Or þai in þare statis be adrest. And sa it accordis be ressoune That all examinacioun Off þai personis properly The kirk hes in þat party, For to refuss or to commend, As sic thingis may be kend, Off sic statis to þare greis To be relevit in digniteis. Or þan in caiss it mycht fall like Sum hethin man or erratike Mycht vsurp sa Cristin feis, To wyne or ioiss sic dignyteis, Quhilkis were abhominacioun, That outtragiouss translacioun Agane all poynt of Cristin fay. Forthy princis suld alway Honour þe kirk deuotly, And trete þe minsteris reuerendly. This Stevin pape þan liffand, As Scottis corniklis ar recordand, Twa ?eris regnand Schir Ewane As [kinge] of Scottis endit þan, [And efter] at he wes dede þan tyte, Till him succedit ane Heid Quhit. And quhen þis paip Stevin wes dede The secund, Paull raiss in his steid Nixt him, and x. winter he In honour held the papis se. He wes a man of almous grete, Baith of mony and of mete; Ilka nycht in prevatye He wald wit þe necessite Off all þat were neire him by; For he wald vesyte bodely All þare herbryis and se weill How þai demanit were ilk deill, Wedois and auld waik folkis baith, And help and þaim releif fra scaith. In Burgone þat tyme wes a man, That Gengalsus callit wes þan; He wes a man of gret pete, Bot a wickit wif had he That liffit als in lichory, And had a lemman specially, That for till haif at will þat wif Reft fra hir husband þe lif. And efter at he wes dede he wrocht Myraklis, bot scho trowit þaim nocht; Bot contraryit þame, and said ay Oftsyss, quhen scho herd sa say That hir husband myraklis wrocht: “?a, þat is trew or ellis nocht. My maister wes of gret pete, A haly man, I wist, wes he; He wes a man of gret meryt; I hope his saull fra payne be quyte. I trow he dois na mare sic thing Than myn eris can musik sing.” In opin placis euer fra that day Scho wes behind he trumpand ay; Sa wes scho schamyt in ilk steid, Ay fra þin furth to þe deid. Quha þat luf wald perdrury Suld haue chosin for a lady, Than can sa blithly beire þaim in bed; Be ware forthy sic ane to wed. Quhen þis Paull deit neist him syne Succedit þe secund Constantyne, Stevin þe þrid, syne Adriane, And Leo papis were ilkane, Quhen emperour wes Constantyne, Than of France wes Charlis Pepyne, And gret Charlis lord and syre, Than to releif wox þe empyre. Thire papis all gud haly men, And techit folkis þe treuth to ken. CHAPTER CIII. Off Charlis lif and gouernyng, And off his feill abbais founding. Sevin hundreth winter and nynty And viii. to rekin fullely, Quhen Stevin þe thrid and Adriane, That papis were, þe dede had tane, Leo þe thrid paip wes left To syt in þe papis se þare eft. He techit þe Romanis Cristin fay, Bot felly him demembrit þai; For his toung þai tyt out quyte Out of his mouth for gret dispite, And syne þai put out his eyne twa, And banyst him demembrit sua Fra Rome out of þe papis se. Bot ?it efter restorit wes he, And throu myrakle neuerþeles ?it spak he efter and said his mess. Than þe gud Charlis, lord and syre, Raiss to gouerne þare empyre, And þire dispitfull tratouris fell, That demembrit, as ?e herd tell, This Leo, þat wes pape of Rome, This Charlis wald be law and dome To schamefull deid haif put þaim þare, Na ware þe papis þra prayare; And neuerþeles ?it þan gert he Thame previt and syne banyst be. This worthy Charlis þe emperour Grew in stait, hicht and honour; He get þe Uniuersite Fra Rome to Pariss drawin be, That þe Romanis befor þan Throu mycht out of Athenis wan, A famouss cete vmquhile of Grece, Quhen Romanis drew fra it þat pece. In all þis tyme the Pightis ware Wonnand within þe Scottis þare, Quhen of Pightis Nectane Derlyne Regnyt and foundit Ross Merkyne. This emperour Schir Charlis þan Wes a waill gud Cristin man, And honorit gretly haly kirk, And vsit ay gud werkis to werk. Als mony abbais foundit he As letteris ar in the A B C; And ay a letter capitall, For to byde testimoniall, Per ordre all of fyne gold maid, As he þai abbais foundit had, Worth mony a pund to praiss, And all per ordre þai abbais Mycht be knawin to fundacioun, Ilkane be þare successioun. Archbischoprikis twyss twa He foundit in Almany alsua, Trewere, Colyne, Magundyne, Salisburgis, and dowit þaim syne With gret rentis and riches; And Spayne he wan fra Sara?enis, Quhare slane wes Rolland wiþ tressoun Throu þe fals tratour Gan?elone. Charlis a man wes of gret strenth; His berd a fut wes of large lenth. A haire heid he vsit oftsyss till eit, And he wes man of mekill meit. At þe erd apon his hand Ane armyt man he wald ger stand, And lyft him evin vp rycht Till his browis and maire on hycht. His sonnys he techit to ryde on horss, And armyt als to prufe gret forss, And on seire wyss to assay þare pyth; Gret curtasy he kennyt þaim with. He gert his dochteris baith weif and spyn, Gif þai fell pure þare meit to wyn, Sa þat þai suld nocht for idilnes Faill in neid na in thowlesnes. He wes of gret deuocioun; For all tymes without þe toune A large myle, quhen þat he come To þe cete of gret Rome, Fra his horss þan wald he lycht, And on his feit he wald ga rycht To Sanct Peteris kirk in þe tovne, And þare do his deuocioun. Gret gestis is maid of his prowes, Bot nocht sa gret as þare causs wes. At Aquysgrane his body lyis, His saull in ioy of Paradiss, Aucht hundreth winter and fouretene Fra lichtare wes þe Virgin clene, And of his kinrik þe xl. ?ere, And þe fift to rekin cleire; Emperour ?it neuerþeles Bot xiiii. of thai he wes. CHAPTER CIV. How in þe graif of Charlis Pypyne A fell serpent wes sene þat tyme. The gestis of France originall Tretis þus sayis his story haill, That þare wes a prince callit Pypyne, That gat apone his concubyne A sone þat hecht Charlis Marcell, A hawtane knycht and a cruell. All Almany he wan of weire, Saxone, Swawyne and Bawere, Burgone, Barry and Gyen, Tuskane, Affrik, he wan then. He spendit sa fast in his trawale That his travaill begouth to faill; Till his knychtis to pay fee Littill or nocht leiffit had he; For sic delite at he wes in He spendit mare þan he mycht wyn. Fra halykirk the teyndis þen He reft wiþ mastry, and gaif his men. And þus quhen he had wastit fast, The dede ourtuke him at þe last. Than with solempne and he seruice He wes beryit in Sanct Denys. Ay till him succedit twa; Karoloman wes ane of þai, Be byrth he wes þe eldest broþer; Neist him þe Pipyne hecht the toþer. To this eldare Karoloman Turone and Affrik fell to than; Bot to Pypyne þe ?oungare broþer Fell Burgone, Province and seire oþer. Sa efter þat tyme mony a day The graif quhare Pypyne eldest lay Thai rypit, and the body socht; Bot thai couth fynd of it rycht nocht, Bot a serpent waill vgly, That fleyit all þat stude þare by, Fell to behald and venamuss, Till all that saw it and deutouss. That delf þai stoppit hastely, And away sped þaim spedely. This elder broþer Caroloman Till halynes all gaif him þan, And tuke for deuocioun The habit of religioun, And drew him fra all besynes, As monk liffand in wildernes, And foundit þat tyme abbais twa; Off Sanct Andro wes ane of þai, Off Sanct Siluer wes þe toþer. This Pypyne, þat wes ?oungest broþer, Than behuffit to tak alhaill Off France þat tyme the gouernall. In all þat tyme Schir Hildorik Had in possessioun þe kinrik Off France; bot ?it he wes þan In his dedis bot a daft man, In na thing reput of valew, Na couth do na thing of vertew, Na had bot nomen sine re; Thare for þe less prisit wes he. The statis of France socht forthy To þe pape þan ?achary, And prayit him be his counsall To discerne for gouernall, Quheþer he ware worþ to haif the crovne, That had of vertu þe renovne, Off manheid, help, and of defens, And þar to couth gif diligens, Or he þat lay in lechernes, Worth to nakyne besynes. For þe commone stait þan he Decretit him þan king to be That wes like to mak defens For his land with diligens, Bot to trete þe possessoure With all worschip and honour, And haboundance of riches. With Hilderik rycht sa done wes, That passit þare by till ane abbay, And lid his lif till his end day; And þis Pypyne for his renovne Wes maid king and baire þe crovne, And in lele mariage efter þat He to sone gud Charlis gat, That succedit be þis chance King till all þe realme of France, And efter þat deit emperour, As ?e haif herd, with gret honour. Be þis ensample ?e may ken That oftsyss vertu drawis men Till honoure and to digniteis, And þe contrare, as men seis, That dignyte without vertew In litill reput is of valew, As sayis þe wyss clerk Bowes, That in his tyme commendit wes. In þis tyme þe king callit Heid, Off Scottis king, deit, and in his steid His sone regnyt callit Fergus; Bot þis þat Heid callit wes þus Wes callit Heid [Fyn] in Scottis lay, And in Inglis Heid Quhit þat is to say. This Fergus Heidis sone, quhen he wes ald, Had a sone wes callit Sewald, Sum men callit him Kokalle, That king wes oure þe Scottis all. His sone Dougall gat Alpyne; Kennad Makalpyne he gat syne. Heid and þire twa kingis were Befor Alpyne fyfty ?ere. CHAPTER CV. How þe Sara?enis waistit Rome, And of a mervalus madin grome. Qwhen Charlis dais were all done, Lowes nixt him, his awne sone, Twenty ?eris he wes and five Emperoure nixt him successive. And þis Leo paip þan deid, Stevin þe ferd sat in his steid. Syne Paschas and Eugenyus, Valerius and Gregorius The fourt held þe papis se. The Sara?enis with þare men?e The cete of Rome þan oure ?wd. Sa mony þai were in multitud That all þe land þai tuke of forss, And stabillit in þe kirk þare horss. Off Rome and all þat tyme wes Cristin men in gret distres; For fals Cristin men, þat were þan, Wrait fra Rome to þe Soudane, And said, gif he wald in hy Cum to Rome, he mycht wyn it lychtly. And þar upon he come in weire, And waistit Rome with his powere, And Tuskane and all Ytaly. The emperour Lowes with all hy Assemblit þe Lumbardis als fast Till him, and to Rome he past, And wiþ þe Sara?enis faucht þen, Quhare slane wes mony Cristin men; Bot of Sara?enis slane wes ma. Out of þe land he gert þaim ga; Bot, as þai past in to þat quhile, All Poill þai waistit and Se?ele. A gret fyreflaucht and a fell In Rome hapnit, as I herd tell, All a nycht attour fleand, Like to dragonis fyre schutand. A madin als in þat cuntre But meit or drink liffit dais thre; And hailstanis in þe lift throu strenth Fell, þat were sa large of lenth Off menis feit fully fyftene, And aucht fut braid, withoutin weyne. Quhen þis paip deit, þe ferd Gregour, Off quham þat ?e haif hard befor, The secund Sargyus ?eris thre Wes paip, and fully held þat se, And crovnit in þat ilk tyme þare The emperour callit Schir Lothare. Leo [þe ferd] nixt Sargyus Off Rome wes paip: Rodulphus Off Ingland king, as Erose sayis, And of his land past in þai dais, As in till haly pilgrymage; To Rome þan tuke he his viage. Thare he resauit wes curtasly, And festit full delitably. And to þis Leo þe [ferd] paip, Befor seire prelatis and bischap, He hecht of deuocioun ilk ?ere To send to Rome a deneire To pay, a penny þat is to say, Off all fyre housis fra þat day Off Ingland to þe kirk of Rome, Fra þinfurþ to þe day of dome, For him and his airis all. The reik penny þai vss to call Euer sen syne þe said payment, That þis king gaif first assent. CHAPTER CVI. How a woman wes maid paip, Borne of Ingland and þin couþ chaip. Qwhen þis Leo þe [ferd] wes deid, A woman occupyit þat steid Twa ?eris as paip fully and maire. Bot scho wes wantoun of hire waire; Scho wes of Inglis nacioun, And wyly of condicioun, A burgess dochter and his aire, Off lyre plesand and rycht faire; Thai callit hir fader Hew of Lyne. Fra him and his and all hir kyne With hir luf scho passit of land Prevely, na man wittand, And at Athenis in study Scho baid, and lerit besely; Bot nane persauit hir woman, For scho baire hir all tyme as man, And callit her self Iohne Maguntyne. ?a, wit ?e weill, a schrew full fyne. And fra Athenis on to Rome As a solempne clerk scho come, And had of clergy sic renovne That scho be commone electioun Wes chosin paip withoutin mare. ?it fell it at hire cubiculare Lay by hir, and gat a barne, That all hire clergy mycht nocht warne. And as scho past on a day To processioun, in þe way Hire child ill all sodanely Travalit hire sa angrely That sodanely thare scho wes deid, And erdit in that ilk steid Without prayere or vrysoun, Or ony vther deuocioun, And but ony oþer seruice That fallis to papis on þar wiss. Benet all þire nixt þat wif Twa ?eris paip wes in his lif. CHAPTER CVII. Off ald corniklis of Scotland Off kingis and sanctis þarein beand. Aucht hunder winter and fyfteyne Fra God wes borne of Mary clene, Leo and Charlis þan baith were deid, Lowes his sone regnyt in his steid. The king of Pight Constantyne Foundit Dunkeld in þat tyme, A solempne place and cathedrall, Dowit with rentis gret and small. Thare bischop and channonis seculare Seruite God and Sanct Colme þare, The thrid of reputatioun Off our bischoprikis of renovne. Eftere þe Natiuite That wes þe mater of our gle, Aucht hundreth winter and twenty, Quheþer ma or less, or few þarby, Hungus þe king of Pightis þan Faucht agane king Athilstane, And wan him þan throu forss in fecht, And brocht him syne efter, for all his mycht, To Elstanefurd by Hadingtoun, And maid him þare accusatioun That he had done him gret despite And till his men, and na coundit Wald keip, bot brak him euer fay, And presonyt and pynit his men ay. And þare he gert smyte of his heid Rycht in to þat samyn steid, And syne apone a speire hely Gert beire it to þe Quenys Ferry, And on þat crag, but langere let, Apone a stake he gert it set. Than furth in his deuocioun He ekit þe dotatioun Off Sanct Androis kirk in fee, With landis in regalite. Syne Sanct Androis relikis ware With honour gret resauit þare; And fra his dais all done were, The Pightis were nocht xx. ?ere Within þe kinrik of Scotland Off powere na of mycht bydand. Aucht hundreth winter and fourty Fra God wes borne of our Lady, Alpyne king wes ?eris thre. Sua with þe Pightis barganyt he That faill of þaim throu forss of hand He put þaim quyte out of Scotland. He wan of weire als all Galloway; Thare he wes slane and deid perfay, Quhen Lowes wes emperour, Charlis sone, in gret honour, Aucht hundreth winter fourty and thre Efter þe blessit Natiuite. And quhen þis king Alpyne wes deid, His sone regnit callit Kennede, A douchty man stalwart and stout; All þe Pightis he put out, And gret batallis þan did he To put in fredome his gre. Sextene ?eris he wes liffand Fra þe Pightis left þe land; Out of Argile þan þe Scottis He brocht, quhare þan þe Pightis notis Occupiit and maid þare duelling. He gert þe Scottis be brocht, as king Oure þame, and tretit þaim fauorably, And þaim defendit manfully, And maid þaim lawis þar efter syne Wer callit þe lawis Makcalpyne. At Fortyvyot his lif tuke end. Till Ycolnykill þan wes he send, And þare entyrit ?it he lyis. Thare his writt sayis on þis wyss: Primus in Albania fertur regnare Kennedus, Alpini filius, prelia multa gerebat. Expulsis Pictis regnabat octo bis annis, Et post Forteviot mortuus ille fuit. Aucht hundreth fifty ?eris and nyne Fra lichtare wes þe clene Virgyne, Sanct Edmond of Est Ingland Tuke þe kinrik in his hand, And þat samyn ?ere wes deid The king of Scottis, þis Kennede. Donald, [his] broþer, in Scotland Wes efter him as king regnand Four ?eris, and syne at Scone Throu slauchter wes his dayis done. In Ycolnykelle lyis he, As men may be þire versis se: Rex Donaldus erat in Scotis quatuor annis; In bellis miles strenuus ille fuit. Regis predicti frater fuit ille Kennedi, Qui Scone fertur subditus esse neci. For till expound in Inglis leid Thire epitafyis þat we reid, Epithafy is to say A writt abuse a graif, perfay, That schawis quha in þat graif lyis, And how he liffit and on quhat wiss; And sa þis word quhen þat ?e heire ?e wait quhat at it menis cleire, For outher forow þe Latyne verss, Or efter þe sentens of ilk verss, ?e may wit quhat þe sentens sayis, Þocht it be nocht rehersit alwayis. Quhen deid wes Donald, þan Constantyne Nixt efter him king wes syne Xv. winter in Scotland, And with Norwayis þan fechtand Wes slane in till Merdogha. In Colmkyll he lyis alsua, And oure his graif, ?it to reherss, Writtin men may fynd a verss: Nam Constantinus fuit rex quinque ter annis; Regis Kennedi filius ille fuit. In bello pugnans Daciorum corruit armis; Nomine nigra specus vbi illa pugna fuit. Than Constantyne þan regnand Oure þe Pightis in Scotland, Sanct Adriane with his cumpany Come of þe land of Irkany, And aryvit in to Fyfe; Thare he chesit to leid his lif. At king Constantyne askit þai Leif to preche þe Cristin fay; And he þame grantit with gud will At þare liking þat to fulfill, And leif als to duell in his land, Quhare þat þaim thocht mast plesand. Than Adriane with his cumpany Togidder come in Capeloghy; And sum men in to þe Ile of May Chesit to duell to þare end day, And oþer sum chesit be north In seire placis on þe Watter of Forth. At Enterit Sanct Monane Of þat cumpany wes ane That chesit him sa neire þe se To leid his lif; þare endit he. How, Harrald and Hungare Off Denmark þat tyme cummyn ware In Scotland with a gret multitud, And with þare powere it oure ?ude. In paganry all liffit þai, And in dispite of Cristin fay In to þis land þai slew mony, And put to dede be martery; And apon Haly Thwrisday Sanct Adriane þai slew in Maii And mony of his cumpany, And in þat ilk ile thai ly. Syne past þai furth in Ingland And mony Cristin þare slaand; The king of Ingland, Sanct Edmond, That tyme þare þai brocht to ground. Aucht hundreth winter and sevinty And aucht for to rekin fullely, [Hed] regnyt anerly bot a ?ere, This king, Constantynis broþer deire; Baith were þai sonnys of Kynnede. Gregour Makcalpyne slew this Heid, And efter him neist wes he king, And had Scotland in gouernyng; And in Ycolmkill his body lyis Vnder þire verss on this wiss: Eiusdem frater regnauerat Alphi Heid vnus, Qui Greg Makdougall saucius ense perit. Hic postquam primum regimen compleuerat annum, In Strathalium vitam vulnere finierat. Thai of Denmark in þat quhile Were in Ingland in gret perile; For sum of þaim þare for þare syne The erd opinnit and swellyit in That be name wes callit Hubbane. Quhare he wes perist þar wes a grene, And now is bot a blak lowgh sene, And þat lough, as I heire tell, Is ?it callit Hubbanis Well. CHAPTER CVIII. Heire it tellis how a king of France Happinnit to fall a felloun chance. Aucht hundreth ?ere foure score and ane Fra God of Mary flesche had tane, Pape of Rome þan Nycholas, Nyne ?ere in þat se he was, And Lowes the secund emperour Twenty winter in þat honour. This king Gregour, þat had slane Heid, And wes king regnand in his steid Xviii. winter, and þan he Stoutly held þat ryalte. The kirk of Scotland, befor his dais That grevit wes with þe Pightis lawis, He relevit with all fredome, Fra he king in þe kinrik come. All Ingland he wan of weire, And Irland als with his powere. He lyis als in Ycolmkill; His epithaphy reid quha will: Greg sua iura gerens rex fit annis decem et octo; In Dunde probus morte retentus erat. Hic dedit ecclesie libertatem Scoticane, Que sub Pectorum lege redacta fuit. Huius ad imperium fuit Anglica [terra] subdacta, Quod non leua dedit sors sibi bella terens. This Gregour, þat I speik of beforne, Sum sais he deit in Kingorne. And sa, for causs þat he Crist kend, He had ay hap quhare euer he wend; For he luffit God and haly kirk, Grace he had his will to wyrk; Thocht and deid he maid baith evin, That brocht his saull efter to hevin. Princes ?arnand hie honour Suld hald þis king to þare merour, For to luf God and haly kirk, Gif þat þai think wisly to wirk; For quha to wroth God has na dreid, He sall spurne oft quhen he suld speid, And at þe last end wrechitly [Be] condampnyt perpetualy. Off Sanct Androis bishop þan Wes Kellagis, callit a haly man, Quhen þat king wes þis Gregour, Quham of ?e herd tell befor. Nixt this paip Nycholas Paip of Rome five winter wes Haldand þat se Adriane. He send legatis in Brettane Thare to renew þe Cristin fay, That tane befor þat lang had þai. Iohne þe auchtand paip wes syne; Till him succedit paip Martyne; Viii. hundreth ?eris foure score and five This paip Martyne endit his live. Charlis þan, a king of France, Hapnit throu a felloune chance To be revin with a baire In hunting; sa he endit thare. Quhen Gregouris dais were all done, Donald, Constantynis sone, Wes king in Scotland xi. ?ere, And held that stait and that powere. In Murray syne he murtherist was In to þe toune of Foras. In Ycolmkill lyis he; Outwith him þire verss men may se: Post hunc in Scotia regnauit rexque Donaldus; Hic Constantini filius ortus erat. In villa fertur rex iste perisse Forenssi, Vndecimo regni sole rotante sui. CHAPTER CIX. Off auld kingis in Brettane, And quhar þai ly in tovnis of stane. Nyne hundreth winter and viii. ?ere, Quhen gane ald Donald dais were, Heidis sone, callit Constantyne, King wes xx. ?eris and nyne. King he sessit for to be, And in Sanct Androis a Kilde He foundit and liffit ?eris five, And, abbot maid, endit his live. Off him þarefor writtin ar þir verss In Latyne, þat I sall reherss: Constantinus idem, cuius pater Heid fuit Albus, Bis deca rexque annis vixit atque decim. Andree Sancti quinquennis in vrbe Religiosus ibi vir abbas obiit. In till þis paip Iohnis dais The auchtand, as Frere Martyne sais, Charlis þe thrid þan emperour Baid bot a ?ere in þat honour And monethis to þai thriss thre. Abbais mony foundit he And kirkis of religioun; Sa his tyme in deuocioun He spendit and in halynes. Flanderis in his dais wes Releiffit till ane erldome With custome, abilitie and fredome, Quhare befor þat tyme it was Bot a land of sympilnes; The gretest befor at liffit þare The king of Francis forestaris ware. The duchery als of Normundy Raiss þan first to sen?eory. Quhen þis Charlis þe thrid wes deid, Arnulf in a preve stede To Iohne the auchtand pape Martyne The secund a ?ere pape wes syne. In till his tyme ordanit he In Rome þe pape ay chosin to be, And nouther emperour nor ?it king To be at þe electioun chesing, Bot þe electioun to be ay At cardinalis and clerkis to say Quhilk at þaim thocht mast avenand, And þe electioun sa to stand. Emperour our papis seire I leif now to writt in heire; For all þar dedis to record Sall do prolixite and nocht conford. Nyne hundreth winter fourty and thre Efter þe blessit Natiuite, Quhen deid wes þe king Constantyne, King of Scottis nixt him syne Malcome Makdonald ?eris thre, And syne in Murray slane wes he. In Ycolmkill his body lyis; His verss ar writtin on þis wiss: Rex huius Malcolmus successit et in tribus annis, Rex Donaldus filius huius erat. Interfecerunt in vultu Murraviense; Gentes appostatici dolo fraudeque cecidit. Nixt this Malcome wes regnand Indulf ix. ?eris in Scotland. Fodaght þe bischop bannyst he Out of Sanct Androis his avne se. Bot ?it þis bischop neuertheles Viii. ?eris efter þat liffand wes, And gert a textuere be maid þat quhile, Quhare in wes closit the Ewangile, Platit oure with siluer brycht, One þe hie altere standand rycht At þe north end; for to reherss In Latyne gravin ar þir verss: Hanc Ewangelii construxit totam abiti Fodagh qui Scotis primus episcopus fuit. To Sanct Androis in Scotland Kirk cathedrall ?it standand That texter ilk man may se, As befor rehersit we. This king Indulf facht sa fast With þe Norwayis till at þe last He wes at Colly slane in fecht. In Ycolmkill syne wes rycht Entyrit, and þare to reherse Outwith him writtin ar þire verss: Post hunc Indulfus totidem regnauerat annis, En Constantini filius et Hede albi. In bello pugnans ad fluminis ostia Colli Daciorum gladiis protinus occubuit. Quhen Indulf king wes dede away, Dulf wes king efter his day. In Murray dede efter he was, And murtherist alsua in Foras, And caryt of þat tovne wes he Deid on nycht in prevate Till a watter þareby rynnand, That callit wes þan Fyndrin strand, And in a pule under þe brig Thai slang him doune, and leit him lig. Bot þare wes neuer sone schynand Quhill he wes þar in lyand, And throu þe takin of þat thing Men trowit at þare lay þe king, And rypit in þat pule sa fast Till he wes funding at þe last. ?it outwith him, quhare his body lyis, Thir verss ar writtin on this wiss: Quatuor et senis rex Duf regnauerat annis, Malcolmi natus, regni iura gerens. Hunc interfecit gens perfida Murraviensis, Cuius erat gladiis cesus in vrbe Forassi. Sol abdit radios, ipso sub ponte latente, Quo fuit absconsus, quousque repertus erat. Quhen this king Dulf dede wes þen, Nixt him regnyt king Culen, And regnyt fully ?eris foure In Scotland, and a half ?ere oure. In þe kinrik wes a man, And Rodard to name men callit him þan; He had a dochter faire and ?ing, And rycht plesand; forthy this king Revist hir. Rodard forthy Slew þis king in his foly, As is notit be þire verss, Opinly to mak reherss: Filius Indulfi totidem quoque rex fuit annis, Nomine Culenus, vir non sapientia plenus. Fertur apud Lovias illum truncasse Rodardus Pro rapta nata quam sibi rex rapuit. To this king Culen deid, Malcolmus sone, þe king Kynneid Wes oure þe Scottis in Scotland Foure and twenty ?eris regnand. The Erll of Anguss in his dais Comequhare callit, þe story sais, Had a dochter Sibill cald, That borne a sone had ?ong and bald. At Dunsynnen this Kynnede That king gert put þis child to dede. Fra þin his moder had ay in thocht To ger þis king to deid be brocht; Na far scho mycht nocht do it be mycht, Scho gert fell tratouris be hir slycht, That the king befor þan wend His lele legis had bene kend. And as throu þe Mernys a day The king wes rydand þe hie way, Off his awne court sodanely Agane him raiss a cumpany In to þe tovne of Fethircarne. To fecht wiþ him þai wer full ?arne, And he agane þaim facht sa fast Till he wes slane þare at þe last. And of þis thing to mak reherss Outwith him writtin ar þire verss: Post quem rex fertur Scotis regnasse Kennedus, Malcolmi natus, quatuor et deca bis annis. In Fethircarne tellis fuit et arte peremptus, Nocte truncatur Sibilis fraudeque cadendus. Quhen Constantyne, king Culenus sone, This king Kenneid to dede has done, He wes bot vthere half ?ere king, Quhen all þus happinnit his ending. At þe heid of þe watter of Awyne The king Gryme slew þis Constantyne, And writtin outwith him ar þire verss In Latyne, now for to reherss: Rex Constantinus, Culeni filius ortus, Ad capud ampnis Awene ense peremptus erat. Nixt efter þat slane wes Constantyne, The self slaare of him, king Gryme, Succedit, and viii. ?eris regnand In to þe kinrik of Scotland. The king Malcome fellonly Slew him in þe feild of Bardry, And outwith him writtin ar þire verss, That in Latyne ar to reherss: Annorum spacio rex Gryme regnauerat octo Kennedi natus qui duce genitus erat. [Quo] truncatus erat Bardoris campo habetur, A nato Kennedi nomine Malcolmo. Quhen dede wes þus þis king Gryme, Malcolms raiss, at slane had him, And xxx. winter in Scotland This Malcome king wes regnand, And wes in deid a douchty knycht, Stout and hardy, bald and wycht. In to þe Glammys on a day, For he had revist a faire may Off that land þan lyand by, Thai raiss agane him sodanely; Bot mony of þame þare gert he Throu his douchtynes that day de; Bot ?it þan fechtand neuerþeles Slane in to þe feild he was. And quhen þus all his dais wer done, Efter him he left na sone, Bot a dochter hecht Betow faire, That of law wes till him aire; Bot scho wes blamyt in hir live, The bischop of Dunkeldynnis wif. Off hir I byde to mute na mare, Bot to proceid in oure matere. CHAPTER CX. How Oto emperour fra traytouris Eschapit and come till his honouris. Nyne hundreth winter and nynty Fra God was borne of our Lady, Benet þe vii. paip of Rome And kepare of all Cristindome, And Oto the secund emperour Viii. winter wes in that honour. He wes in deid a douchty knycht, Stout of manheid and of mycht. Off Agare and of Barbary Twa gret ostis hawtanely Come in Calabare all of ware, All arrayit with huge powere. Throu fyre and armes þai brocht doune And waistit all þat regioun. Aganis þaim the Romanis He gaderit haill, and þe Almanis; And with thai strangearis facht sa fast At thai him vencust at þe last. Baith his ostis fra him fled, Bot [few] bydand in þat steid; And þare of neid, as him behuffit, Out of þe feild he him remuffit, And till a schip at wes neire by, That to saill wes all redy, He come rynnand in gret haist, As he out of þe press wes chaist, And fen?eit him a sympill knycht, That wes eschapit fra þe fycht, And said he wald in pilgrymage For his saull heill þat viage Tak richt to Ierusalem, And fra þat syne vnto Bathlem. Forthy he maid þaim faire prayere To tak him in with þaim to faire. And sa he gat with faire trete In þare galay þar entre. And as þai were on se saland, In Grew he herd þaim þare sayand That thai wald hald on in þat traid To Constantinople, and in that raid Thai wald stake, and þare tak land, And of þat knycht to mak presand To þat mychti emperour, And of him þare to get tresoure. And quhen this emperour Oto herd, In till his hert he wes full ferd; For he vnderstude rycht weill Off Grew þir wordis ilk deill; Bot þe schipmen trowit nocht Off þair leid at he couth ocht; Than he vmbethocht him of a wile How þat he mycht þaim best begile. The maister þan in prevate He callit, and tald him þat he Had all his gold in to þat ile That þai were sailland by þat quhile, And þat ile is Ci?ill cald. “Forthy,” he said, “maister, and ?e wald Gif me ?our consent here till, To þe land now pass I will, My gold þat is þare in to get, And cum to ?ow foroutin let.” The maister of þis thing wes fayne, And bad him speid him sone agane, And trowit wonder weill þat he Off gold had a gret quantite; All þat þai thocht fra him to ta, And mak him presonere alsua. Apone þe land thai set him rycht, And, fra he gat out of the fycht, He sped him in gret hy to Rome. And efter that he þidder come, All þai schipmen he gert spy, Quhill þai agane come; þan in hy He gert þai traytouris euerilkane Be arrestit þare and tane. Xl. þai were and weill ma; All þare hedis he tuke þaim fra, And quyt þaim sa þare varysoun, That wald haif done him þat tressoun. CHAPTER CXI. How þe deuill dissauit a paip, That did till him þe gretare iaip. Fra þe Natiuite past oure A thousand ?ere and þar to foure, Fra þat deid wes þis Benet, Nixt him foure papis had þare det Payit of kynd, and tane þe deid. To þaim succedit in þar steid The secund Siluester, and ?eris foure Wes paip of Rome, and mare attoure, A Franche man be nacioun, A monk als be professioun, Off þe abbay of Florens, In the diosy of Aurelyanenss. Bot prevely he stall away Be nycht out of his abbay, And worthit ane appostata. And till at he wes liffand sa, He covate attour mesoure Hie estatis and honour; And þare upone in prevete With þe feynd he maid trete, And till him als he maid homage. And þare he hecht him avantage, And þat he suld releiffit be, Or he deit, to þe papis se, And in þe meyntyme with all Till vthire statis þat mycht fall. The bischoprik of Renss rycht sone Fell vacand, and þar to he wes done. And syne þe archbischop of Rawen Waikit efter; þat gat he þen. Efter þat vaikit þe papis se; Chosin to þat wes he. Fra stait to stait thus raiss he fast, Till he wes paip maid at þe last. His promovare him oft assayit How of his part he held him payit; “All weill,” qoud he rycht blithly, And thankit him of his curtasy. Quhen he wes in his stait hieast, In till his thocht ay wald he cast How his lattyre end suld fall Efter his estatis all. Than at þe feynd apon a day, As þai were samyn in þare play, He askit him how lang þat he In þat estait suld liffand be. The deuill ansuerd till him agane That he in alkin eise, but pane, Suld lif and in prosperite, Ierusalem till he suld se, And in it als suld sing his mess. Off þat word wonder blith he wes, For he thocht neuer out of Rome To Ierusalem to cum. Sa it fell efter on a day, As he oft in till oiss had ay With his clergy throu þe tovne To gang in till processioun, And sa in till a kirk he come, That þai Ierusalem callit in Rome. And quhen þis pape revestit wes And redy for to syng his mess, He herd about him a gret dyn, As mony deuillis were þarin. Than sperit he quhat þai vsit to call That kirk, and thai him ansuerd all, Ierusalem in Streit Laterane. Than [sychis] maid he mony ane, And maid opin predicacioun Off all his obligacioun To þe feynd, and said “Allace! That euer borne of moder I was!” Bot ?it he trowit nocht for thy That God suld of him haif mercy. Than gert he þare his toung out tak, That with the feynd sic wordis spak; Syne gert smyte of his handis twa, That with þe feynd þe band couth ma; And efter þat syne baith his feit, That for to mak þat cunnand ?eid. Thus of his membris he maid deviss, That seruit the feynd in þat seruice; Bot his saull for till endure He commendit till his Creature. Sa mony trowit þan þat he With haly men suld savit be, For his verray repentans That he had of his fell chance. This Siluester in his ?outhheid Be bapteme Garbart to name had; Off him were writtin thire verss, As he wes greyit for till reherss: Transit ab R. Garbartus in R. fit papa [vigens] R. Qui fuit promotus [ab] episcopatu Revensi ad archi-episcopatu[m] Raviense[m] et vltimo ad papatum. He had twa lordis at his lare, That his ?oung scolaris sumtyme were, Schire Oto þe first emperour, And Robert, þat king wes of honour Off France; and the pape liffand thus, Than maid wes Sancti Spiritus Assit nobis gracia, The sequens, with other ma Versis, þat vsit is to say Ilk ?er of Witsonday, Befor þe Ewangeill in þe queire At þe hie mess ilk ?ere. The Denmarkis þan with stalwart hand Distroyit the south of all Ingland; All Cantyrbery and Lyncolne schyre Thai waistit wiþ wappinis and wiþ fyre. Off men and barnis, and wiþ women, Thai summond þaim be ten and ten; The tend part þai kepit qwik, The laif ay þai wald sla and stik, Sparand na condicioun Off seculare, na of religioun. Viii. thousand summond þan were kend Off bodyis savit fra þe teynd, And bot foure monkis anerely; The laif were slane doune but mercy. Off Ingland þat tyme þe barnage Payit to þe Denmark gret trewage, Ilk ?ere xl. thousand pund Off vsuall money, gud and round. And for Sanct Alphege wald nocht pay Thre thousand pundis of þat monay, For he wes Archbischop of Canterbery, And till hald it fre stude stithly, Thir tyrandis tuke þis haly man, That of þat kirk wes archbischop þan, And held him lang quhile in hard pyne; A lurdane slew him of þaim syne, That he had hovin in Cristin fay, And nocht befor þat bot a day. [CHAPTER CXII. How þe auchtand Benet pape Apperyt tyll ane hally bischope.] A thousand winter and fourteyne Fra God wes borne of Mary cleyne, The auchtand Benet tuke the se As pape of Rome; in þat ?ere he Out of þat see wes put sone, And ane other foroutin hone Wes set, and gret sisma sua Raise þat tyme betuix thai twa. And quhen þis pape Benet wes dede, And ane other wes in his steid, As Peter Damyane þar of sais, A haly bischop in þai dais On a blak horss saw rydand This paip Benet sa sittand. This bischop vnabasitly Spak to this spirit stoutly, And said: “Art þov nocht þat Benet That sumtyme held þe papis set? And weill we wait at þov art deid, And ane vther haldand þi steid.” He said: “That sary Benet am I, That held þat stait vnworthely.” “Aa, fader,” he said, “þov tell me now Thy faire.” And he said: “?it I trow Out of fell paynis frely To be deliuerit throu mercy Off my mychtfull Creature, Throu prayere of þe Virgyne pure, That is my help and my succour. Ga thov to Iohne my successour, And bid him seik in sic a place Be name, for in it sumtyme was, And ?it is, of gold a sovme lyand. Bid him tak it and be giffand To pure folk; for in na thing All that I delt in my liffing Helpis nocht me; for wranguis gift Off reif and falsheid forow schrift Mendis me nocht, thocht I it wan, Na spendit nocht it gudly þan.” This bischop did his bidding weill, And did as he bad ilk deill; And for ferdnes of this, perfay, He gaif his bischoprik vp þat day, And enterit in to religioun, And deit þare in deuocioun. Quhen þis pape Benet þe viii. wes dede, Iohne the xx. tuke þat steid; And nixt him Benet þe ix., and he Fourty winter held þat se. Gret ryotis, as Frere Martyne sais, Fell in þis Benettis dais; For in þat stait, quhile he, quhile he, Be diuerss personis held þat se. And þis pape, þat nynt Benet, To Benet þe auchtand, at þat stait Held befor, wes nevo neire. Bot efter fra he wes brocht on beire, Till a bysyne best all like Seyne he wes besyde a dyke; For taill and heid as horss he had, And as a beire wes all elike braid; Like till a beire wes his body, Bot taill and heid like a horss suthly. He þat him saw he wes sa rad That, for þe gret dreid at he had, He wald rycht fayne haif bene away; Bot þan he begouth to say: “Haif þov na dreid, bot I þe pray, Speke with me or þov pass away. As þov art now, I wes a man Sumtyme; bot I baire me nocht þan As I suld haif done of det; For quhy I wes pape nynt Benet, In sege I baire me bestialy, And led my lif ay lustfully; Forthy I am as þov may se. Bot ?it I trow to savit be Throu help of þe Virgin pure, The moder of my Creature.” Quhen þis wes said he wit away, And þis gud man gert for him pray. CHAPTER CXIII. How till Corrod þe emperour A child throu chance [wes successour]. All this meynetyme þe [empire] had Henry þe first and syne Conraid; Till Henry Conraid wes successive; He maid gret lawis in his live. Quhat euer he war at brak his pess, Of quhat estait þat euer he wes, He suld thole the payne of dede, But ony mercy or remeid. Sa fell it at ane erll him by Gert sla a man in his foly, And for that deid, as him behuffit, All prevely he him remuffit Till a forest neire þar by, For to lif þare quyetly, With his wif on his tresore, That he had gaderit lang befor; A manere place þar biggit he, Baith for him and his men?e. This emperour Conraid on a day Past in hunting him to play, And raid sa fere in þat forest In gamyn till þe day wes past, Sa þat þe myrk nycht sodanely Partit him fra his cumpany. And sa þat myrk nycht wauerand will, Off cass it happinnit him to cum till The erllis new biggit place, Thare he and his induelland was. And quhen he saw þe emperour, He was abasit for radour, Bot quhen he saw him anerly, He wes glaid, and welcomyt blithly, And herbryit him rycht weill þat nycht Till on þe morne þe day wes lycht. And þat ilk nycht it happinnit þare The erllis wif to be lichtare Off a faire sone befor day; And þis emperour, rycht quhare he lay, Herd a voce say twiss or thriss All opinly apon þis wise: “This barne now borne, Schir Emperour, Salbe to þe nixt successour, And efter þe baith lord and syre Off all þe landis of þi empyre.” And fra þe emperour þis had herd, In till his mynd he wes rycht merd; And on the morne sum deill airly With his men he met sodanely, And bad twa men in prevate Ga wait þar oportunyte, And steill þat barne, and wiþ it ga To þe wod, and þare it sla; And þe hert of it till him bring, Sa þat he mycht wit be þat thing That þe barne were dede but dreid, And sa were destany brokin in deid. Thir twa men stall the barne but hone, The emperouris bidding till haue done; Bot pete sa supprisit þar thocht, That his bidding did thai nocht; Bot with þar hundis slew a haire, The hert of þat best with þaim baire, And gaif þe emperour Coraid, And said þai did as he þaim bad, For þai had slane, þai said, þe child, And left þe body to bestis wild. Sa hapnit a duke to cum rydand, Quhilk saw þis barne wes qwik lyand, And sa In hert That child In till his Bring For he Sen we ar like na barne to haif, Nouþer madin child nor knaif.” The child þan tuke scho wilfully, And gert foster him tenderly. Lang efter þat in pilgrymage The emperour past, and in his viage Him happinnit to soiorne a day With þis duke, and rycht as thai Togidder set at þe mete ware, This child befor þe duke þan schare; For he wes ?oung and avenand, Gentill, curtass and full plesand. The emperour saw him, and persauit That he of þaim wes haill dissauit, That he had chargeit þaim to say; And richt as he wes musand sa, Than to the duke in prevate He said a gret erand had he For?et as to the emprice; Forþi þat child apon his wiss Behuffit his letter till her beire. The duke it grantit but dangere; Sa did þe child, for he wes keynd, And said with glaid will he wald wend. The emperour þan vpo? þis wiss Wrait a letter to þe emprice, And bad scho suld gert put to deid The berare of it but remeid, Fra scho had gert the letter reide. Thus bad þe letter þare, but dreide: Visa litera lator illius morte moriatur. The child tuke leif and on can pass To þe emprice quhare scho was, And wist na thing of þis perile. Sa happinnit it in þat quhile That with a persoune in his way He baid, and eit with him a day, That of him had befor knawlege, And ferlyit fast quhat kyn message That he suld beire to þe emprice, For he couth tell þar of na wiss. Sa efter meit the child couth sleip, And this persone þar to tuke keip And sone ane oþer can he write, As send were fra þe emperour To þe emprice of honour; And þus þe effect wes of þe dyte That þis wiss persone couþ write In Latyne: Visa littera Latori reddatur mea filia. That is to say: “My dochter deire, This letter red, to þe berere Thou gif, and gere þaim spousit be.” Thus spak this letter in prevate. He closit it full curiusly, And [in] þe purss rycht prevely He put it quhare þe toþer wes. The child fra sleip sone efter raiss, And till his erandis on he gais; Bot of þis deid wist he rycht nocht, Apone his travale wes his thocht. His leif he tuke and furþ on past, And to þe emprice at þe last He come, and present with honour That letter, fra þe emperour, He said, wes send; and honestly Scho him resauit; hastely That lettere gere scho till here reid. And, fra scho herd it, sone in deid Scho gaif þe child her dochter faire To be his wif, þat wes þare aire, And did in all as þe tennour Off þe letter bad fra þe emperour. And quhen scho had on þis wise done, The emperour þarefter sone Happinnit to cum hame hastely. The child remuffit him prevely, That ferlyit fast how all thing fell, And quhy þe emperour wald nocht him tell Off þe mariage; forthy thocht he To byde quhill he mycht sicker be. The emperour þar efter sone Sperit how þat scho had done Off þe letter þat he send. And scho him tald fra end to end, And said scho had fulfillit weill All his bidding euer ilk deill. Than fra he herd at þis wes done, He trowit he wes þe dukis sone; And held him payit of þe spousall, And gaif þis child þe gouernall Off his land with his dochter faire; And þus gatis destany maid his aire To þis Corraid þe emperour, And till him wes next successour. Gif destany be neidfull thing, That I commend to þare iugeing That clerkis are, for nane am I; That me forthinkis increly. And quhen this Schir Corraid wes deid, This child succedit in his steid, That callit wes þe secund Henry, And gouernyt the empyre vertuously. CHAPTER CXIV. How a bischop of symony Wes convickit all opinly. In that samyn tyme apon chance Thare come in till þe realme of France A legat send a latere, For to vesyte and to se How þat bischopis gouernyt þaim þare, And oþer prelatis seculare. Sa þis ilk legat fand That a bischop of þat land Sat þat stait throu symony, And liffit alsua viciously, Cuvatuse and incontinent. This legat þar for in iugement Sittand in plane chapitere, Gert þis bischop þare appeire; And said him be public defame That þai put till him gret blame, That he enterit be symony, And liffit alsua viciously. This bischop wes a wyly man, And corrumpit with giftis þan All his accusaris, sa þat he Gert þaim till him haldand be, Sa þat nane wald him contrare, Quhill þis legat wes sittand thare, Nouþer in word na ?it in deid. And þis legat couþ nocht proceid Be nakyne accusatioun In to that visitacioun; Bot ?it he trowit neuer þe les That þis bischop all vicious wes. Than said þis bischop: “Sen I na can Proceid be help heire of na man, Be Goddis vertu in till deid One þis wiss I will proceid. Be þe Haly Gaist now lat se Gif in þi stait wes entre; Say Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto.” Than Gloria Patri et Filio This bischop said and þan maid [ho]; And þat rehersit he oft syss, Oftare þare þan anys or twiss; Bot Spiritui Sancto be na way Mycht he with his lippis say. This bischop þan confessit how he In his bischoprik gat entre With giffin and symony, And led his lif all viciously, As covatouss and incontinent. This legat þare in iugement Assol?eit him of his cursing, And gaif him pennance for his liffing. Sa wes his benefice vacand, Remanand in þe papis hand, That gaif it syne quha to him list, As he and þis legat thocht best. In þis ilk tyme in Rome þai fand A body of a dede gyand; Fra heid to feit þare þai him met, Gif he on fut had bene set, Like it wes at he had bene Hieare þan þe wallis were sene Off Rome, or of ony cete, That hieast þan mycht funding be. A wound wes seyne in till his syde Off foure fut lenth, and mare þat tyde; And in his graif wes sergis twa Birnand cleire, and ane of thai Wes brycht birnand at his heid, The toþer at his feit wes levid, In evinlik licht birnand cleire, That mycht be slokinnit on na manere, Be watter na be wyndis blast; Bot gif a man wald in þaim thrast A scharp brod, or þan wald stik In ilk sergis a scharp prik, Quhare þe aire mycht haif entre, Sa sloknyt mycht þai serges be. His epithaphy till reherss Wes writtin outwith him in to verss: Filius Evandri Pallas quem lancea Turni Militis occidit more suo iacet hic. This gyant in till his tyme was Be commone name callit Pallas. Turnus, þe sone of Ewander, Befor had slane him with a spere, And with oþer feill wappinnis seire; In to þis graif he lyis heire. In Apuly as of a man A mekle ymage wes sene þan Off marbill; bot a cerkill was Seyne apperand as of brass, And writtin it wes all about That cerkill þan red þai but dout: “The Kalendis of May þe sone rysand, My heid salbe of gold gletand.” Sa were þare þan a Sara?ene, That lang tyme presonere had bene, That tuke sic consait of þis writt That he thocht help to get of it. Sa waitit he the formest day, At þe sone rysing, of Maii, The hede he brak of þat ymage, And þar of wan he sic a wage That he gat gold in sic fusioun That it payit out all his ransoun, And maid of þe laif gouernall Till him and his perpetuall. In till þis ilk tyme in till France Till a lord hapnyt a fell chance: As he wes sittand at his meit, With myiss he wes sa vmbeset That nouþer for him na his men?e He mycht on na wyss get saufte, Nouþer for styngis na for stanys, Than þai cleiffit fast on his banys; Na for na wappinnis þat men mycht get Thai mycht nocht þai myiss fra him set; Be schip na bait, na ?it galay, Mycht þai nocht sauf him be na way; Nouþer be se, na ?it be land, Mycht nocht þis lord him self warand. Than, bot ony manere of remeid, Thire myse put þis lord to deid. The auchtand and þe nynt Benet In Rome held þan þe papis state. In Scotland Malice, a wiss man, Off Sanct Androis wes bischop þan Viii. winter; and quhen þat he Wes dede, þan Kellagh tuke þat stede and se, And held it xx. ?eris and five. The secund Kellagh in his live Wes callit; and quhen dede wes he The secund Malice tuke þat se. Till him succedit Schir Malmore. Off þire is gud till haue memore. CHAPTER CXV. Off þe sext pape Gregore, And of Edmond Irnysd befor. Qwhen þis Benet þe ix. wes dede, Gregour þe sext sat in þat steid, And twa winter he held þat se. Bot euill reullit þat fand he; For littill or nocht þat he fand, That till his stait wes sufficiand. Mony papis befor his dais Were rekles, as Frere Martyne sais; For in till falt of gud defens Off vertu, and of negligens, Gret possessionis þai tynt quyt Be fell tyrandis, þat had delite Possessionis and pilgrymage to tul?e, And mony leill men to dispul?e. And quha his cursing wald nocht dreid, Agane þaim sa he wald proceid That he wald gere þaim be tane or slayne, Or put in presoune, or in payne Off dede, be iugisment of law, Sum to hang, and sum to draw. A felloune tyrand he wes forthy Callit, and murmuryt opinly. Sa in his last infirmyte, Quhen nocht wes trowit bot he suld de, The cardinalis said opinly That all men demyt him nocht worthy For till haue hallowit sepulture, Quhen þat he wes of hert sa doure For to gere sla men but mercy, And spilt gret blude vnwayndandly. And quhen he herd had þar decrete, In till his seiknes lyand ?ete, Befor him þare þan gert he call The cardinalis and þe pepill all; And þare rehersit þare sentens, Syne said þat of gud consciens He did all at he gert do; Forthy na blame suld ly þarto, Na he deseruit na defame, Supposs þai put till him sic schame. “And gif it be Goddis will forthy, Quhen I am deid and law sall ly, That I haue hallowit sepulture Withoutin schame or dishonour, Be ?e nocht, schiris, sa obstinate Till hynder or to suppriss my stait.” The cardinalis ?it neuerþeles, Fra he wes deid of þat seiknes, Wald nocht thole him haif entre In to þe kirk; bot þai gert be All þe duris closit fast. Bot of wynd a sodane blast All þe duris brak vp sone. Than trowit þai it throu myrakle done, And sa þai maid him wyde entre In þe kirk with solempnyte; Deuotly þan with gret honour Thai maid him hallowit sepulture. In till þis tyme king Etheldreid, Edgare þe pessabillis sone, but dreid, Off Ingland tuke possessioun, Septre and coronatioun, Quhen þe Denmarkis were wedand, With fyre and slauchter distroyand, Sparand nouþer wif na man, That stude agane þar purposs þan. Ane erllis dochter, his first wif, Till him a sone baire in hir lif; Edmond Irnesid callit wes he, For his hie worschip and bountie. Sone efter fra his wif wes deid, He baid nocht lang in wedoheid; The dukis dochter of Normundy, That Em be name hecht opinly, And Richart wes hir fader name, A manfull lord and of gret fame, This Etheldreid tuke till his wif, And gat apon hir in his lif Bodely oþer sonnis twa; And þe eldest sone of þai Hecht as his fader Etheldrede; Sanct Edward hecht the toþer in deid. Bot a fals tratour callit Gudwyne Betraisit þis Etheldrede syne, And murtherist him swikfully Within þe cete of Hely. Be þe allyans of Normundy Etheldreid traistit him þe mare forsy; Sa gert he all apon a day Be done to dede and put away Off þe Denmarkis, þan [þat he fand Wastand þe kynryk of Ingland. The Denmarkis þan] be?ond þe se, That wonnand were in þare cuntre, Fra þai herd of þis slauchter done, With a huge navyne thai come sone. In all þe havyns of Ingland Thare þai aryvit and tuke land; Than wayndit þai nocht to do scaith Till abbais and to kirkis baith. Auld and ?oung, baith man and wif, Thai sparit nocht to reif þar lif. Swanus and Knowt, his sone, þan Chiftanis were, and mast our men Off þat felloune nacioun, That maid þat fell distructioun. Bot Etheldreid maid gret defens Agane þare fellony, and resistens, And mellit oft with þaim in fecht; Thare mony doure to deid wes dycht. And for mare dreid and for gret perill Till Normundy in to þat quhile His wif with his first sone he send; And þidder he followit efter hend, And þare þai baid till at þis Swayne Oure takin wes with dede sodane. And sum men sais at throu Edmond Irnsyde he wes brocht to ground, Be slauchter and be na oþer deid. The Inglishmen þis Etheldreid Fechit þan out of Normundy, And him restorit honestly Till his estait; bot ay Schir Knowt, Schir Swanus sone, set him in dout All tyme als lang as he Liffit, and held þat ryalte. In Lundone endit he syne his lif; Than weddit this Schir Knowt his wif, Dame Em, a quene of gret fellony, Duke Richartis dochter of Normundy. CHAPTER CXVI. How Malcome Canmor Duncanis sone Wes gottin ?e may heire but hone. A thousand winter and thretty And foure oure passit fullely Eftire þe haly Natiuite, That wes þe caus of all oure gle, Malcome þe king of Scotland deid, His sister sone in till his steid, Duncane be name, in to Scotland Sex winter full wes king regnand, And gat twa sonnys of lauchfull bed. ?it neuerþeless in his ?outhheid, As he past apon a day In till his hunting him to play, With all his court in cumpany, On his gammyn all thochty, The staill and þe settys set, Him self with bow and wiþ brachet, Fra slak to slak, oure hill and hicht, Travalit all day, to þe myrk nycht Partit him fra his cumpany. [Than] he wes [will] of his herbry, Till at the last, he wauerand will, Off hapnyng he come to þe myll Off Fortevyot. Þare þe myllere Resauit him on gud manere To meit and drink, and till herbery, And seruit him rycht curtasly. This myllare had a dochter faire, That maid to þe king þat nycht repaire. And till hir fadir displesit it nocht; To be relevit þar throu he thocht Off þe king, baith he and scho; His will þe better wes þar to. Sa scho baire him a presand, That scho wist wes till him plesand, And he resauit it curtasly, Hir and hir presand thankfully, And chesit þare þat faire woman To be fra þin his luffit lemman. And that ilk nycht, þat þe king Tuke wiþ þe myllare his gestnyng, In to þe bed with hir he lay, And gat a sone on hir or day, That callit wes Malcome Canmore, Thare efter crovnit king þar for. This woman he wald haif put till hycht, To gret stait and to meikle mycht; Bot Fynlaw Makbeth, his sister sone, Lettit þat purposs to be done, And vthere gretare purposs als; For till his eme he wes full fals, That fosterit him full tendrely, And gaif him rentis and sen?eory. He murtherist his eme in Elgyne, And vsurpit his kinrik syne. For þi of that vere maid þire verss Writtin in Latyne to reherss: Duncanus genuet Malcolmum nomine natum, Qui senis annis rex erat Albanie. Fynlaus nepos eum percussit Makabedus; Vulnere locali rex apud Elgin obiit. This is to say in Inglis toung: King Duncane gat Malcome ?oung, That callit wes syne Malcome Canmore, Gottin of þe myllaris dochter befor; Bot þis Duncane to dede wes done Throu Fynlaw Makbeth his sister sone, That slew his eme in till Elgyne, And falsly held his kinrik syne. Thus quhen þis king Duncane wes deid, This woman wes rycht will of reid; Bot scho a baitwart efter þat Till hir spousit husband gat, And king Duncane, befor he deit, This woman in a land he feit, And gaif it hir in heretage, Till hir and hirris of hir lynnage; Sa þat efter þat mony a day The Baitwartis landis it callit þai. And syne be generatioun, And lyneall successioun, Fra þis myllare discendand Dame Mald þe Emprice quhill liffand Wes fra him in the ferd degre, The stok nocht reknyt for to be. Als fra þat myllare discendand Kingis come, at were regnand In Scotland and Ingland, successive, As men may rekin ?ow belive, Fra Malcome, þat oure king quhile was, And Henry secund, at Sanct Thomas Wes martyrit vnder, þan regnand In to þe kinrik of Ingland. As for to rekin forthermare, Discendand evin fra þe myllare, Come Malcome oure king, at dochteris twa Had, and dame Mald eldest of þai Wes, þat quene wes of Ingland. Off Mary þe ?oungest descendand, That of Bolone wes countass, Honorable in hir dais, Be lynyall successioun Come mony famouss gret persoune. Clement þe sevint paip of Rome Be lyne doune of þat lady come; And sa it wes at be þat lyne This pape Clement wes cosyne To Robert Stewart our secund king, That Scotland had in gouernyng, Contemporane quhen that he In Awynyoune held þe papis se. Thus papis and kingis cummyn were, As ?e haif herd, of þis myllere. CHAPTER CXVII. How Edmond Irnesid tholit dede Throu a traytour in a close steid. A thousand ?eris xxx. and nyne Fra lichtare wes þe suete Virgyne, As tresoune þan in Scotland, All quyt þar of wes nocht Ingland. For in Duncanys our kingis dais, As þe story þarof sais, In Ingland Edmond Irnesyde Wes king; bot Knowt wes in þat tyde, And held him hely apon weire. Togidder oft with his powere In feild þai mellit in to fecht. This Knowt, þat wes a wyly knycht, As he persauit in þat fycht At he wes neire a supprice sone, Out of þe batall held but hone, And efter send message of trete Till Edmond king, and þat herd he. Throu counsall þan þai tretit sa, All Ingland to be delt in twa: The half suld Schir Edmond haif, And to Schir Knowt syne all þe laif Suld fall. Þus þai consentit þan, And þar apon maid a ragman With mony seillis of lordis þare, That þat tyme at þat trety ware; And quhen þai on þis wiss done had, Ilkman till his resset raid. Sone efter þat a tratour keyne, That thocht releiffit till haue bene Off Schir Knowt, waitit quhill he Saw Schir Edmond on þe preve, Thare apon for to do his eiss; Neire vnder by þe traytour wes, And with a speit murtherist þe king Edmond, and brocht him till ending In þat ilk first ?ere þat he Tuke of his realme þe ryalte. Dame Em, þai said, þat in hir lif His stepmoder wes, and Knowtis wif, Duke Richartis dochter of Normundy, Be hir slycht kest þis iuperdy. To Schir Knowt þan als fast This tratour with gret gladschip past, Thinkand rewardit for to be; And on this wiss Knowt hailsit he: “God sauf my lord, for now is nane Off Ingland king but ?e allane.” Schir Knowt þan askit him how þat was; This traytour tald him all þe cass, How he had Edmond Irnsyde slane. Than thocht Schir Knowt in hert wes fayne, ?it he dissymylit neuerþeles, And to þat traytour þis ansuer wes: “Sen þov hes put away my fa, The hieast man I sall þe ma Off all Ingland; thov dout þe nocht.” Than gert he in gret hy be brocht The hieast gallouse at men mycht se, And on þe hieast hill þan he Off all Lundone, but langere let, He gert þat hie gebet be set, And þat traytour þan gert he First drawin, and syne hyngit be. And syne efter quhen þis wes done, A counsall he gert sembill sone. Than askit he gif ony þare That wist quhat kyning condicionis ware, Or ony manere of conuencioun Wes tretit of successioun, Or maid befor in ony tyde Betuix him and Edmond Irnsyde; Be vertu of þare fewte He bad it suld declarit be. Amangis þaim wes a flechand man, At said þare wes nane liffand þan, That Edmond wald, fra he wes deid, Prefer to Schir Knowt in his steid To be king be successioun, Or befor Knowt to beire þe crovne. Thus, quhat be falsheid and fleching, The crovne he gat, and wes haill king; And all þai þat he wist at ware In reid or counsall till him contrare, Or to þe crovne neire be lynnage, That he couþ get wit or knawlege, He gert be slane and put to deid, Withoutin mercy or remeid. Edmond Irnsyde had sonnys twa, Edmond and Edward callit were þai, And in þe kinrik þai were duelland; Bot he na wald sla þaim in Ingland, For to eschew repruf and schame; And be þis colour to put by blame, To þe king þan of Swethrik He send þaim baith in fraude and swik, For he to Knowt wes cousing kend, Thai barnis to be slane he send. Bot þis king þan, for pure pete That of þai barnis þan had he, Wald nocht þaim sla, nor do þaim scaith; Bot richt þan furþ he send þaim baith To þe king of Wngary, That þame resauit thankfully, And gert þaim with gret honeste Fosterit and fairely tretit be; And with Schir Edmond, þe eldest broþer, He weddit his dochter; syne wiþ þe toþer, The ?oungest Edwart, wiþ honour Till Henry, þat tyme emperour, He send þat sone, efter þat wes Weddit with his dochter, Dame Agas. Bot Schir Edmond, þe eldest broþer, That weddit had, befor þe toþer, The kingis dochter of Wngary, Deit rycht sone and hastely, And gat a barne in til his lif One þat lady, his weddit wif. Bot on þe emperouris dochter faire Schir Edward gat, to be his aire, A sone callit Edgare Ethling, Off all Ingland till haif bene king. One hir he gat als dochteris twa; Mergret and Cristin callit were thai. Mergret wes oure kingis wif; Cristyne chesit to leid hir lif In habit of religioun, A nwne maid be professioun, That scho held weill till hir ending; Syne ?ald hir saull till Hevinnis King. All this tyme Schir Knowt led his lif With Dame Em, his spousit wif, The Dukis dochter of Normundy, And gat apon hir bodely Harde Knowt, at wes his sone; Sone efter at his dais wes done. This Hard Knowt on his moder syde To Sanct Edward wes þat tyde Half broþer; bot he tuke sone ending. Off Ingland þe statis, to be þare king, Send for Sanct Edward in Normondy, And prayit him to cum hastely In Ingland for to tak þe crovne, And full stait and possessioun. And he did as þai can him pray, As ?e sall heire efter, perfay. Fra Ingland now I turne my stile, Off Scotland for to carp a quhile. CHAPTER CXVIII. How Malcome Canmor come to þe crovne Off Scotland and tuke possession. In till þis tyme þat I of tell, That þis tressoune in Ingland fell, In Scotland fell neire þe like caiss Be Fynlaw Makbeth þat þan was, Quhen he had murtherist his avne eme Throu hope at he had of a dreme, That he saw forow þat in sleping, Quhen he wes duelland wiþ þe king, That tretit him fairely and weill In all þat langit him ilk deill; Becauss he wes his sister sone, His ?arnying oft he gert be done. A nycht him thocht in his dremyng That he wes sittand neire the king, At a seit in hunting sua, And in a lesche had grewhundis twa. Him thocht, till he wes sa sittand, He saw thre women by gangand, And þai thre women þan thocht he Thre werd sisteris like to be. The first he herd say gangand by: “Lo, ?onder þe thayne of Crumbaghty!” The toþer sister said agane: “Off Murray ?onder I see þe [thayne.”] The thrid said: “?onder I se þe king.” All þis herd he in his dremyng. Sone efter þat, in his ?outh heid, Off þai thayndomes þe thayne wes maid; Than thocht he nixt for to be king, Fra Duncanis dais had tane ending. And þus þe fantasy of þis dreme Muffit him for to sla his eme, As he did falsly in deid, As ?e haue herd befor þis reid; Syne wiþ his awne emys wif He lay, and with hir led his lif, And held hir baith his wif and quene, Rycht as scho forouth þat had bene Till his eme þe king liffand, Quhen he wes king with crovne regnand For litill taill þat tyme gaif he Off þe greis of affinite. And þusgatis quhen his eme wes dede, He succedit in his steid, And xvii. winter wes regnand As king with crovne in till Scotland. ?it in his tyme þar wes plente Off gold and siluer, catall and fee. He wes in iustice rycht lauchfull, And till his liegis rycht awfull. Quhen Leo þe tend wes pape of Rome, In pilgrimage þidder he come, And in almus he sew siluer To pure folkis þat had gret mistere; ?it vsit he oftsyss to wirk Proffitably till haly kirk; Bot as we fynd in his storyis That he wes gottin on selcouth wiss. His moder to woddis wald oft repair For þe delite of hailsum aire. Sa, as scho went apon a day To wod all be hir ane to play, Scho met of caiss with a faire man, Neuer nane sa faire, as scho thocht þan, Sa mekle, sa strang, sa faire be sycht, Scho neuer nane befor, I hecht, Proportiound weill in all mesour, Off lyme and lyth a faire figour. In sic aquayntans þare þai fell That, schortly þarof for to tell, Thare in þare gamyn and thare play That persone by þat woman lay, And on hir þat tyme a sone gat, This Makbeth, þat efter that Grew to gret stait and to hicht, And to gret powere and to mycht, As befor ?e haif herd said. And fra þis persone had wiþ hir pla[id], And had þe iurnay with hir done, And gottin had on hir a sone, He said he a deuill wes at him g[at], And bad hir nocht be fleit of þat, For he said at his sone suld be A man of hie stait and pouste, And na man suld be borne of wif Off power to reif him his lif; And þare apon in takynnyng He gaif his lemman þare a ring, And bad at scho suld keip it wei[ll], And for his luf had þat iowei[ll]. And efter þat oft vsit he To deill with hir in prevate, And tald hir mony things suld fall That scho trowit suld haif bene all. At hir tyme scho wes lichtare, And þat sone at he gat scho bare, And callit him Fynlaw Makbeth to name, That grew, as ?e herd, to gret fame. Thusgate wes Makbethis ofspring, That maid him efter of Scotland king, As of him sum story sais; Bot quheþer it sa were or oþer wais, As to be gottin naturaly, As oþer men ar generaly, I wait nocht, bot his dedis were fell, As ?e may heire, and hes herd tell. For first quhen he to ryss began, His emys twa sonnys lauchfull þan For his dreid of þe kinrik fled. The thrid, nocht gottin of lauchfull bed, Malcome past of þe land alsua, As banyst with his breþer twa, To Sanct Edward in Ingland, At þat tyme þan wes king regnand, That thaim resauit thankfully, And tretit þaim rycht honorably. And in till Scotland þan as king This Makbeth maid gret stering, And set him for his gret powere Ane hous of fenss to mak of weire Apone þe hycht of Dunsynnane. Tymber þar to till draw and stane [Off] Fyfe and Anguss baith gert he Mony oxin gaderit be. Sa on a day in þat travaill A ?oke of oxin he saw faill. Than askit he quha þat ?oke aucht, At þat tyme fail?eit in þat draucht. The dryffaris ansuerd him agane, And said Makduf, of Fife þe thayne, Thai twa oxin for suth aucht, At he saw fal?e in þat draucht. Sa fell it at Makduff wes neire, And herd weill all þir wordis seire; Than spak Makbeth dispitously, And said to þe thayne angrely, As he were wrythin in his will: “Me think,” he said, “it were nocht ill To put þin awne nek in ?one ?ok, For þi stottis to draw ?one stok, To þov and all þin were wraith; A blase I set nocht by ?ow baith.” And fra þe thayne herd him speik For ire his hert begouth to brek; Bot of his thocht he maid na sang, Bot prevely out of that thrang With slycht he gat, and þe spensare A laif him raucht till his suppere; And als sone as he nycht mycht se, And tyme and oportunyte, Out of þe court slely he wan, And þat laif baire he with him þan To þe watter of Erne. Þat breid He gaif þe baitwart him our to leid, And on þe south him to set But mare delay or ony let. That passage wes callit efter þan In Scottis Portu Abyrdan, That in Inglis is to say The havin of breid to þis day. Oure þat watter he him set But maire delay or ony let. At Dunsynnane Makbeth þat nycht, Als sone as his suppere wes dycht, His merschall callit him to þe hall, And quhen at þai were semblit all, The thayne of Fif away wes myst, Bot quheþer he went wes nane at wist. ?it þan a knycht at þe suppere, [That] to Makbeth wes sittand there, Said till him: “Schir, it is ?our part For till inquere now quheþerwart The thayne of Fif þis tyme is past, For he is wyly and sle of cast; And forthy I counsall ?ow To wit quheþer þat he is now.” And þus he muffit Makbeth in deid Agane Makduf for to proceid; And sa he did as ?e sall heire Forthire mare of þis matere. Makduf fra he wes feryit oure This thayne Makduf, quhen he wes set On south half Erne, but langere let He held his way fast on in Fyfe, To Kynnaghty, quhare þan his wif Wes wonnand in a houss of fens, The quhilk he bad hir wiþ diligens That scho suld keip, and gif þe king Come þidder to mak assal?eing, Or ony fellony þare to do, He gaif hir bidding þan þat scho Suld hald him to faire trete, Till scho a bait suld sailland se Fra þe north vnto þe south land, And quhen scho saw þat bait sailland, Than tell Makbeth þe thayne were þare, And byd him to Dunsynnane faire; For, or he se þe thayne agane, He suld bring hame wiþ him certane Him þat wes his lauchfull king, And bid him trow rycht wele þis thing. To Kynnaghty Makbeth come sone, And wald gret fellony þare haif done, Bot þis lady with faire trete Lettit his fellony for to be Fulfillit till scho þe bait saw; Than to Makbeth but dreid or aw Scho said: “Makbeth, luke vp and se, Wndere ?one saill forsuth is he, The thayne of Fife, þat þov has thocht. Trow þov rycht weill and dout þe nocht, And euer þov se him cum agane, He sall þe set in mekle pane, Sen þat þov wald haif put his nek In till þe ?oke. Now will I speke With þe na maire; bot faire thi way, As now na mare I will þe say.” Quhen þis wes said þar wes na mare, Bot furþ þe bait rycht fast can faire; And þat passage ay syne is cald The Erllis Fery with ?oung and ald. And of þat Fery for to knaw Baith þe statut and þe law, A bait suld be on athere syde For to wait and tak þe tyde, To furthere ony þat oure wald be Fra land to land attour þe se; And fra þe south bait anis were sene Vnder saill þe landis betuene Toward þe north þe traid haldand, Ouþer with saill or routh passang, The north bait suld be redy maid Toward þe south to hald þe traid; And þis wes ordanit at batis twa Suld serf þe cuntre to and fra, And þare suld na man pay na mare Bot foure pennyis for his faire. This Makduf than als fast In Ingland on his wayis past; Thare Duncanys sonnis all thre he fand, That Makbeth bannist of Scotland, Quhen he his eme with tressoun slew, And all þe kinrik till him drew. Sanct Edward king of Ingland than, That wes of lif a haly man, And tretit the barnis honorably, Resauit Makduf rycht curtasly Quhen at he come in his presens, And did him worschip and reuerens; And quhen he had salust þe king, He tald þe causs of his cummyng; And þe king herd him soberly, And ansuerd him full gudly, And said at it wes his delite For to se for [þe] proffite Off þai barnis, and his will Wes þar honour to fulfill; And counsalit þis Makduf forthy To trete thai barnis vertuously, And quhilk of þaim wald wiþ him ga, He said he suld þaim sicker ma With his oste vengeans to tak Off Makbeth for þar faderis saik; And to conquere þar heretage, That to þaim fell be rycht lynnage, He suld þaim help in to þar rycht With all his suppowell and mycht. Than this Makduf wiþ all his mayne Counsalit þaim fast and did his payne To gare þaim grant wiþ him to ga; Bot schortly þe lauchfull breþer twa Forsuke to pass for gret perile That, þai said, mycht happin þat quhile. Than Makduf counsalit rycht thraly Malcome, þe thrid broþer þaim by, Set he wes nocht of lauchfull bed, As ?e befor þis has herd red, To pass with him, sen þai forsuke To follow þar rycht, and he vndertuke That he suld mak him of Scotland king, Sa þat he had nane abaising, Bot to be sekere of hert and will, And manfulnes to tak him till, And bad him þarof haif na dreid; For king he suld be maid in deid, And þat fals traytour he suld sla, That banyst him and his breþer twa, And had his fader slane wiþ tressoune, And held his kinrik agane ressoun. Than Malcome said he had ferly That he him counsalit sa thraly Off Scotland for to tak þe crovne Till he kend his condicioun; For quhy, he said, þar wes na man Mare lichoruss þan he wes þan, And þarfor, he said, for sic thing He dred him to be maid a king; For kingis lif, he said, suld be Ay led in cleynnes and honeste; For he couþ euill be a king, That wes sa lichorus of liffing. Makduf þan ansuerd him agane, And said his son?e wes in vane; “For gif þov vsis þat in deid, Off wemen sall þov haif na neid; For of þi cuntre sall þov haif Als feill and faire as þov will craif. Gif þov has consciens of sic plycht, Mend it to God is mast of mycht.” Than Malcome said: “?it þare is mare, That lattis me mekle wiþ þe to faire; That is þat I am sa birnand In cuvatiss þat all Scotland Is oure litill to my persone.” “I set nocht by þat a buttone,” Quod Makduf, “man, cum on with me; Thov sall in riches haboundand be; For quhy þe kinrik of Scotland Is now in riches haboundand, And quhill in it is ony gud Thov sall want nane, man, be my hude.” “?it þare is mare,” Malcome said agane To Makduf of Fife þe thayne, “The thrid vice ?it mais me let My purposs on þis thing to set: I am so fals þat na man may Trow na word þat euer I say.” “?a, freynd, I leif þe þare,” Quod Makduf, “I will na mare Fra hynefurþ mare carp wiþ þe, Na in þis mater mak trete; Sen þov can now hald na say That steidfast thing wald, or gud fay. Thow art na man of manis kynd Cummyng, bot of þe deuillis strynd, That can noþer do nor say That langis to trewth or gud fay. Thou bradis of the deuill of hell, As men heris in þe gospell tell, Quhare [God] callis him a leare fals; Sa is he and his fader als. Gif þov be fals, fy vpon þe; Heire I gif vp all tretee. I compt rycht nocht þe toþer twa Vicis, supposs at þov haif þai; Bot I compt his thrift all gane In quham lawte restis nane.” Than Malcome ansuerd þare agane To Makduf of Fife þe thayne: “I will, I will,” he said, “with þe Pass, and prufe how it will be. I salbe lele and trew of fay Euirmare till myn endday; For, or I suld be fundin fals, My heid sall part first fra my hals. I did to prufe quhat wes in þe, Quheþer falsheid or lawte; And now I persaif þov art traist. One þe fra þin furþ I dar fraist; For þi my purposs haill is now To pass with þe for myn avne prow, And on þat traytour vengeans to ta, That bannyst ws and my fader couþ sla. With help of God he salbe slane, Or I sall dee ellis in þe payne.” To þe king þan als fast Malcome and þis Makduf past To tak þar leif þan at the king, And he þaim grantit but letting Baith his leif and his gud will, With gret suppowell of men þar till To help to wyne his heretage, And suppleit him als with costage; And to þe erll of Northumberland He wrait, and gaif him in command That he suld pass with all his mycht In Malcomys help to wyn his rycht. Than with þaim of Northumberland This Malcome enterit in Scotland, And past our Forth, evin straucht to Tay, Syne vp þe watter þe hie way To þe Brynnan togidder haill. And þare thai baid and tuke counsall; For thai wist weill at Makbeth ay In fayntsum fretis had gud fay, And trowit ay in sic fantasy, As forouth this to ?ow tald I; At he trowit neuer for to be Discomfit till at he mycht se The wod be brocht of þe Brynnane To þe hill of Dunsynnane. Off þat wod ilk man In till his hand a busk baire þan; Off all þat oste wes na man fre Bot in his hand a busk had he; And to Dunsynnane als fast Agane Makbeth þis oste past; For þai thocht with sic a wyle This Makbeth for to begyle, Sa for to cum in prevate One him or he suld witterit be. Off þis quhen he had sene þat sycht, He wes sa wa he tuke þe flycht, And oure þe Month þai chast him þan Rycht to þe wod of Lumfanan. The flygand þai callit it ay The chass of Makbeth fra þat day. Makduf þe thayne wes þare mast fell Vpon Makbeth and mast cruell; Bot ?it a knycht in to þat chase Followit Makbeth, and nerrest was. Makbeth turnyt till him agane And said: “Lurdane, þov prekis in vane; For þov art nocht he, as I trow, That to þe dede sall put me now. That man wes ?it neuer borne of wif Off powere to reif me my lif.” The knycht þan ansuerd him agane And said: “I wait þov spekis certane; For I wes neuer of woman borne; Off my moder for I wes schorne. Now sall þi tressoune heire tak end; For to þi fader I sall þe send, That is þe deuill, for he þe gat.” The knycht wiþ suerd him slew wiþ þat. Thus endit þare Makbeth þan In to þe wod of Lumfanane. This knycht his heid smat of þare, [And] in takin it with him baire To Kincardin; þare the king Till þare ganecome maid byding. Off his slauchter are þire verss Writtin in Latyne to reherss: Rex Makabedus x??. Scocie septem fit annis, In cuius regno fertile tempus erat; Hunc in Lumfanam truncatur morte crudeli Duncani natus, nomine Malcolmus. CHAPTER CXIX. Off þe fredome of þe thane of Fif That wes grantit him in his lif. Qwhen Fynlaw Makbeth þus wes slane, Than Makduf of Fif þe thayne For his travale till his bounte At Malcome king askit þire thre. First fra his sete to þe altare To be þe kingis haill ledare, And in þat sete to set him doune To tak his coronacioun, Be him and his posterite, Quhen euer þe king suld crovnit be. Eftir þat þe secund thing Wes at he askit at þe king To haue þe wawart of his batall Quhen he in weire his fais suld saill, That he and his suld haif alwais That quhen þe king suld banere raiss. And efter þat þe thrid asking Wes, at he askit at þe king, Gif ony in suddand chadmelle Happinnit slane sa for to be Be ony of þe thanys kyne Off Fife þe kinrik within, Gif he sa slane were a gentil [man], Xxiiii. markis þan For kynbut the slaar suld [pay], And he remyttit suld be for ay; And for ?emen xii. merkis but mare Suld pay þe slaare, And suld haif full remissioun Fra þin of all þat actioun. Off þat law are þe thre capitale, That is þe blak prest of Weddale, The thayne of Fiff, and þe thrid syne Quha euer be lord of Abernethyne. Gif þare be ony þat likis to se The law of þis led, þan may he Herkin quhen þe day is set, As fallis to be done of det; To Cowper in Fyf þan cum he; The law weill led þare sall he se. Efter all þis þat ilk ?ere, That þis Makbeth wes brocht on beire, Aulagh Full raiss vp, and he As king regnyt bot monethis thre. This Malcome king gert sla him syne Within þe toune of Strabogyne, As it witnessis in þir verss That is in Latyne to reherss: Mensibus infelix Fata viri fueras in Strabolgy Heu sic incaute rex miser occubuit. And mony of þire kingis lyis In Ycolmkill; apon þis wiss Witnes beris þir twa verss Off Latyne, þat I will reherss: Hos in pace viros tenet insula Iona sepultos In tumulo regum Iudicis vsque diem. Quha will befor þire bukis reid, As I þis process has led in deid Fra Adam throu þe Irischery, Sall fynd discendand lynyaly Na persone, at I fand, for?et Till Malcome spouss of Sanct Margret. [Fra] Malcome regnit, the x. persone Be evin lyniall discencioun Wes Robert þe secund our king, That Scotland had in gouernyng. Now be the Saxons, or we blyn, To rekyn is Sanct Margretis kyn. The last end of þe first buke Tellis, quha sa will it luke, In till a clere genology Doune discendand lynyaly Fra Sem, þe eldest of þe thre Sonnys gottyn of Noe, Till a lord wes callit Woden, That fader wes to mony men. Amangis þe Saxons sumquhile he Wes callit a god in þat cuntre, And in honour of him forthi The Wednisday þai held haly; And of his lady callit Frea Friday wes haldin for hir alsua. Syne in to þe secund buke A genology quha will luke Till Ine and Inglis fra Woden, That fader wes to mony men. Now in þe genology to proceid, Name be name is hard in deid For to mak or wrytt in ryme, As þai were liffand tyme be tyme. Bot in my buke I fynd nyne Personis succedand efter Ine, Till a king callit Aluereid; Thretty ?ere he wes in deid Off all Ingland king with crovne, And ioisit in possessioun. A hundreth and foure score of ?ere Thare ix. kingis regnand were. Efter þire ix. kingis oure, To rekin, I fand kingis foure, That xxx. winter were regnand Within þe kinrik of Ingland Befor Edgare full of pess; Till Etheldreid he fader wes. This Etheldred gat gud Edmond Irnsyde, þat wes brocht to ground Be þe traytour, quhen þat he In murthure him slew apon þe preve. Bot þis Edmond had sonnys twa; Baith in Swethrik send were þai; In Wngary deit þe eldest, And Eduard nixt him þe ?oungest With þe emperouris dochter weddit wes, That to name hecht Dame Arges. This Edwart gat þan on his wif, Till he with hir led his lif, A sone hecht Edgare Ethling, That till Ingland suld bene rychtuise king. This Eduard als gat dochteris twa; Sanct Margret eldest wes of þai, And Dame Cristiane, hir sister syne, [Non] in þe New Castell on Tyne. And þus be Sanct Margaret our quene, And Malcome Canmor our king clene, All our kingis of Scotland Ar in successioun descendand, Be vertu of þe lauchfull get Off Malcome our king and Sanct Margret. CHAPTER CXX. How Sanct Margaret þe haly quene Come first in Scotland but wene. A thousand twa and fourty ?ere Fra lichtare wes þe Madin clere, Fra Knowt wes deid, and his sone Hard Knowt had þar dais done, Sanct Edward out of Normondy In Ingland come þare honorably, And resauit wes wiþ ryalte. On Pasche day crovnit syne wes he, And all his tyme led haly lif, As sum sais, baith he and his wif; Set weddit wes baith scho and he, ?it endit þai in virginite, As sum men held in opinioun, That wist of þare deuotioun. Mare he sauffit throu his prayere His land, þan throu press of weire. Fra ire, fellony or crabitnes All tyme he wes sene perles; Pride, falset and cuvatise He hatit ay, and averiss; His land he held all tyme in pess, Ay quhill þat he regnand wes. And in þe tyme he held þis stait, To þe emperour than he wrait, That he in Ingland suld ger send Him at he rychtuiss aire kend; For he said þat consciens had he For to hald þe rialte Fra him þat he wist be lenage Suld succeid to it be heretage. Schir Henry, þan þe emperoure, Resauit his lettres with honour, And gert lay schippis to þe se, And rycht weill stuffit gert þaim be With wittaill, and all oþer thing That speidfull wes to þar passing. Schire Edward with his wif Agas, And Edgare Ethlyng, þat þare sone was, And with þaim als þar dochteris twa, Mergaret and Cristiane alsua, With his leif and his benysoun To þare avne kynd nacioun He gaif þaim, and þai held þar way. With wynd at will þar traid held thai, And in Ingland come rycht swith. Sanct Edward of þar come wes blith, And resauit þaim curtasly, And tretit þaim honestly. Syne efter þat few dais gane Sanct Edward kyndly dede has tane, And in Westmynystere with honour Wes laid in hallowit sepulture. For him þe statis of Ingland Wes þan in dolour saire murnand; Thare melody all changeit wes In murnyng and in hevynes; For þai were will quha suld be king, Sen þat Edgare Ethling Wes litill for ?outhheid of valew, To gouerne the realme be vertew. And till þai were in þis hovering, And will quha suld be þar king, Harauld, þat ane erll wes þan Mychti, and a wyly man, Off Denmark be nacioun, Off traytouris generacioun, Tuke till him þe crovne of Ingland, Thare in to be as king rignand, That fell him nocht be lele lynnage, Na be na lyne of heretage. Than William Bastard in Normundy, Fra he gat wittering veraly That Harrald occupiit þat land, He come on him wiþ stalwart hand, And slew þat traytour in þe fycht, That had vsurpit agane þe rycht The kinrik, in disherisoun Off þaim þat suld wiþ all resoun Haif had þe crovne of heretage, Be lauchfull and be lele lynnage. Thus William Bastard in Ingland Enterit to be king regnand. And quhen þis Edgare Ethling, That of law suld haif bene king, Saw þe kinrik distrublit swa, Off counsall wiþ his sisteris twa A schip he gat and tuke þe se; Than for to pass agane thocht he, And till arise in þe empyre, To be resset with his grantschire. And as þai wer on þe se sailland, The wynd sa skant wes þaim blavand, And alkin weddyre in þare faire Wes to þare purposs evin contrare, Sa þat of forss as wyndis þaim muffit, Cum in þe Fyrth þan þaim behuffit, And in Sanct Mergretis Hope belif Off fyne forss þaim behuffit arif; And on þis maner Sanct Mergaret, Nocht apon will, bot all on thret, Come in þe kinrik of Scotland Quhen Malcome Canmor wes regnand, That saw hir a rycht faire woman, And till his wif he tuke hir þan, Throu Goddis graciouss forseying, As wes wele sene be þar liffing, And be þar blessit generacioun, That followit efter þar coronacioun. Allwyne þat [tyme] twa ?eris or thre Wes bischop of Sanct Androis se, And efter him Maldowne þan, That wes of lif a haly man, Wes bischop sevin and tuenty ?ere Off Sanct Androis. Quhen he on beire Wes brocht, þan efter him bischop Waldefe wes, and that tyme pape Off Rome þe secund Nicholas, And emperoure þe thrid Henry was. CHAPTER CXXI. How þe auctour him excusis Agane þaim þat his work accusis. The glorius doctour Sanct Ierome, Noþer bischop na pape of Rome, Bot prest callit and cardinall, That be his study vertuale The Bibill in Latyne fra Ebrew Translatit, and formyt syne o new All þe ordre of þe quere, As ?it is vsit þe manere, He trowit him in his besynes To be battin with bitternes Off inviouse defamand men, That erare will repruf þan ken. Quhat wonder is it þan at I, A wreche liffand simpilly, Dout reprevit for to be Off foly or of nystee, To weyne of vertu mare my wit Than in effect haboundis it? Sua my wayne wit presumptuouss, Nocht plesand nor solatius, A mater gud [suld] bloke or spill, That cunnand men couþ weill bring till Till alkin gud conveniens, With errour or offens. Than suld I worth all rede for schame, That wenys succour me fra blame The gyrth of excusatioun, Gud will pretendand for ressoun, The quhilk I aw of det to spend At þare instance, at me kend Mycht my avne impossibilite. Sua will I now erare chess me To be repruffit of sympilnes Than blame to beire of vnkyndnes. Off my foly now forthy Forgiffis me for ?our curtasy, And fawouris me that I renovne The blissit generacioun That come be þe lauchfull get Off Malcome king and Sanct Mergaret. Throu þar vertuouss meidfull dedis In stait and honour ?it þar [sed is]. Sua þat remanis my delite Thare successioun for to writt Vnto Robert Secund our king Had drivin his dais till ending. CHAPTER CXXII. How King Malcome assayit a knycht That to betraiss him befor had hicht. A thousand sex and fifty ?ere Efter þe birth of our Lord deire, Makbeth Fyndlaw and Lulagh Full Oure dreving had all þar dais in dule, The king Malcome, Duncanis sone, Come with a ryall court to Skone, And þare with gret solempnyte His coronatioun þan tuke he, And all Scotland in heretage Fra þin till him and his lynage; With aith and trewth of his barnee All þar homage þan tuke he That aucht homage to þe crovne. Sua enterit he in possessioun, And regnyt xxxvii. ?ere With a stait, honour and powere. In all Cristindome, I trow, þan Thare liffit nocht a better man, Na ?it of hand a better knycht, Na mare manly, stout and wycht. For amangis oþer famouss dedis, That in corniklis men of him redis, In till his court þar wes a knycht, That wes a lord of mekle mycht; He set him for to sla þe king Throu sum tressonable ymagynyng. Bot in to þe kingis court þan Thare [wes] wonnand a lele man, That tald þe kingis avne persoune At þat lord be sle tressoun Set him to sla him, gif he Mycht se his oportunyte. This lord as þan wes nocht present In þe kingis court, bot wes absent; Bot sone efter he come, wiþ ma Than he wes wont, þe king to sla. With curtasy ?it neuertheles He wes resauit, as he er wes. The king þan warnyt his men?e With him at hunting for to be; And to þat knycht he said alsua That with him selfin he suld ga To sit with him at þe hunting; The knycht consentit to the king. Than on þe morne but langere let, The settis and þe coursis set, The king and als þe knycht þai twa Togidder raid, and nane bot þai, Fer in þe wod, and þar þai fand A faire braid plane and a plesand, But hope or hill, of halsum aire, All wod about baiþ thik and faire. Than said þe king þus to þe knycht: “On fut, gif thov list, thov may lycht, Or apon horss gif þov will be, As þov thinkis best, now chese þov þe. Horssit or armyt alsweill As I am now thov art ilk deill, And thov has wappinnis als redy To fecht or fend as now haif I, And we nane armour haif bot swerdis; Betuix ws deill we now our werdis. Heire is best now to begin Thy purposs gif þov will worschip wyn; For now is nane at may ws se, For to help noþer me nor þe; Forthi, sen thov has maid sic hecht, Do furþ þi purposs as a knycht. Set þov has fadit þi lawte, ?it do þi deid with honeste. Gif þat þov thinkis to sla me, Quhat tyme na now may better be, With opin warnyng and manheid? Or gif þov wald put me to dede With venome, or wiþ felloun poisoun That were a wiffis condicioun. Or ellis gif þov wald in my bed Prevely sla me in þat steid, That were na worschip sickerly, Bot murthrissing vnhonestly. Or wyth a knyf gif thov wald byde Prevely for to wait þi tyde, Quhill þov mycht at eiss me sla, A cowart dois na mare þan sa. Forþi do now as suld a knycht; So we togidder, God deill þe rycht! With oure foure handis, and na ma, Thare on mott all þe gamyn ga.” With þat þe knycht all changeit hew, And his fals purposs saire can rew; His visage worthit paill and wan, And hastely he lichtit þan, And fell on kneis askand mercy At þe king of his fals foly; And said þe king mycht be þe law As a tratour him hang and draw; And þare he put him in his will, To hang or heid, or speid or spill. And þare þe king of his gentriss Forgaif him all apon þis wiss, That he fra þinfurþ suld be lele Till him, and wiþ na tressoun dele; And þar to gert him swere ane aith, Syne to þar men?e fure þai baith. Bot þe king, þat wes his lord, Wald lat nane wit of þar discord, Till þe knycht himself þe cass Tald all, how it happinnit was. CHAPTER CXXIII. How William Bastard wan Ingland, And of his broþer efter him beand. Off Ingland, as þe story sais, That William Bastard in þai dais Throu fauour of þe Scottis men, Thare help, þare will, þar counsall, þen The stait tuke of þe ryalte Off Ingland with aith of fewte, That of det aucht homage to the crovne, And sa ioisit he possessioun. And, for mare sekirnes of þis, Off lordis of Ingland, I wiss, Thare eldest sonis and þar airis, Off erllis, baronis and of maris, And of oþer estatis alsua, Deliuerit till him, he tuke all thai, And send þaim all in Normundy. Thare þai were tretit tenderly; For sum of þaim þar poysound ware, Sum deit in cald and hunger saire. Sua mony lordis deit soneles, And mony rycht lyne deit aireles, And mony lordis at had nane Ostage, bot him self allane, Deit in Normundy þat quhile, And sum for falt and oþer perile; And William Bastard all þar landis Gaif till his kyn þan, þe Normandis. Than þe lordis þat in Ingland ware, That feld þaim þus agreiffit saire, In to sic thrildome to be stad, As of gud counsall mait and mad Lines 143–279 are taken from the Cottonian ms. Lines 139–142 of the Wemyss ms. are missing fom the source document. Þaim al dissawit þai vndyrstude; A prince þai wende til haf had gude, And a kynge, til gouernyt be Wndyr hym withe lauche and leil leaute; And saw þai war supprisit swa, In to þar hartis set þai war wa, And nowþir be powar na be slycht Þai mycht get helpe agayn his mycht, Bot menyt þaim lede wiþe gret dispyte, He set noucht by þar mayne a myte. Bot þrow þe kynrik al he rade; A powar gret wiþe hym he hade, And in ilk famows plasse, Þat seculare or religion was, He ripit, and saw þar gret tressoure Off iowallys, at þai had lange befor; And al þat was of mast walew, Off preciousse iowalis of wertu, Al þa til hym self tuk he, And stuffit gert swa his tresoure be. Be þis þe statis doutyt sar For til haf beyn supprisit mare. Sum of þaim þan flede in Frawns; Þan, for dreid of fellar chawns, Sum soucht succoure in Scotlande, Qwhar Malcom þan was kynge regnande, Þat war gret and hie persownys; Bischopis, erllis and barownys, Our kynge gert ressawit be, And did þaim gret hwmanyte, And gert procure þaim richt weil In al þar likyn ilka deil. Wil?am Bastarde had sonnys thre: Robert Curtosse þe eldest he Was, and Wil?am Rede þe toþir; Henry was þe ?ongast broþir. Þis Wil?am Bastarde, þat tyme kynge, Þus ordanyt þir thre þar liffynge: Til Robert Curtois hallely Þe duche he gaf of Normondy; For he was eldast in lynage, He gaf hym þat was heretage. Til Wil?am Rede he gaf Inglande, Þar in to be kynge regnande; For he his son was myddillest, He gaf hym þar for his conquest. Til Henry he gaf his tressour All, þat he gaderit hade befor. Þis Robert þan, be nayme Curtois, Til haf past set his purposse In til þe Halylande; for þi Til his broþir ?onge Henry A part saulde of his duche For a gret sowme of mone. Bot, qwhen he hade þe mone? tane, Lande til his broþir gaff he nane; For his fadyr hallely Helde fra hym þe landis of Normondy. Na of þat gaf hym nathynge, As he had heycht, til his liffynge.

CHAPTER CXXVI. How a knycht þat wes full ald Said of þe gud quene Mald. A thousand and a hundreth ?ere Efter þe birth of oure Lord dere, Than king of Ingland William Reid Reklesly wes slane to deid; As he a day in hunting past With his folkis in þe New Forast, With a rekles schot of cass A knycht him slew in to þat place. Henry þan his broþer ?ing Crownit wes, and sone maid king; The bischop of Lundone, callit Mawrice, Crovnit him with hie seruice. Oure king Edgare, throu gud trete, Gert Mald his sister maryit be With þis lord Schir Henry ?ing, Off all Ingland þan crovnit king. The archbischop of ?ork þan, A notable commendit man, Crovnit with solempnyte Dame Mald, þat sueit lady fre; And, fra scho crovnit wes, but weyne, Thai callit hir Dame Mald the gud quene. And, for a causs quhilk ?e sall heire Quhen I cum to þat ilk matere, At hir crovnyng wes maid gret fest; Thare semblit ware þe worthyest, And lordis gretest of degre Off all Ingland to that semble. Sa wes þare þan ane ald knycht set That day amang þaim at þe mete, And þire wordis þan said he: “Now in þe rute is set þe tre, Baith frute and flour weill like to beire.” Bot of þis few wist þe manere; Than þai him prayit þat were by That he wald tell þaim opinly Quhat betaknyt þat mysty word, That he recordit at þe burd. Than said þis auld knycht curtasly That he suld tell it opinly. He said: “Till I wes quhile steward With my liege king Sanct Edward, And I befor him wes standand At his meit, and he sittand, Sa wes þare a suspect traytour, At his burd sittand with honour; That he wes tratour þare wes sene Be opin vengeance, withoutin weyne. By þe king þan at þe mete As he wes at þe tabill set, And in his hand a pece of breid, That was þe causs þan of his deid Or he departit fra þat burde, Than to þe king he said þis word: ‘My lord, ?e haif oft herd of me That I suld ?ow betraise,’ said he, ‘And þat I suld be sum tressoun Sla or vndo ?our avne persoune. Gif euer I thocht for to do sa, I pray to God or I hyne ga That þis litill pece of breid Heire in ?our sicht be now my deid, And God lat neuer of it a crote, Till I be weryit, pass oure my throte.’ Than of þat breid he begouth to ete, Bot oure his throt mycht it nocht get; Bot sodanely richt at that burde He weryit, and spak neuer a word. The king þan gert him hastely Be drawin out, and dispituously Oure a hewgh gert cast him doune, Hundis till eit his carioun. The king þus at þe burd sittand, Ay in a study still musand, He walknyt out of his study. ‘I wes,’ he said, ‘in Normundy [Bydand], as ?e wist, sumquhile Out of þis land þare in exile; And sua wes þare twa cunnand men, That oft to me reparit þen, And were my speciall familieris, And plesand and of gud maneris. The stait of Ingland on a day To me sairely þan menyt þai, And said Ingland wes like to be Confoundit for gret iniquite That wes vsit in þat land; For þare wes few in it liffand That wes commendit of verteouss, Bot euill, gredy and lichoruss; Na noþer laugh nor ?it lawte Wes vsit in to þat cuntre; For lordis throu þare cuvatiss The sympill pepill wald suppriss, And bischopis als, and oþer prelatis In haltane vss held þar estatis; Sa þat throu thare iniquite It wes weill like at þat cuntre Suld sone periss for þe syn That wes vsit it within, He said. I askit quhat remeid Mycht help to þis, or stand in steid, And ane of þaim þan ansuerd me, And said: “Sick help may hapnit to be “As be þis rydill I sall þe say, “That efter þis may fall perfay. “A grene tre fra þe rute is sewin, “And fra þe rute a space is drawin “Large thre akir breid of land, “Or neire þar by, þov vnderstand. “Bot ?it þe tre may happin to get “The kynd rute, and in it be set, “And þe sap to recouer syne “Baith of branche and of fluris fyne, “And þe frute þe tre oure spred; “Than is to lippin sum remeid.”’” Than þe knycht said: “Now I se In þe kynd rute set þe tre; This tre ?e may vnderstand To be þe kinrik of Ingland, That in honour and riches, And in gret welth haboundand is. The rute, ?e trow, in kingis seid Quhare of all kingis come of deid That aucht the kinrik of Ingland, Be lyne and lynnage discendand, All tyme regnand efter þat, Syne Locryne fra his fader it gat, That wes Brutus, þat wan þir landis, As ?e herd forouth, fra gyandis. The space of twa thousand ?ere As king of kings ay cummyn ware, Quhill Harrauld, Bastard and William Reid, That now in muld ar lyand deid, Off þat stait interruptioun Maid be þare intrusioun. Thir ar þe aker lenthis thre At forouth þis rehersit we; Alkyne of þir thre throu þar strenth Fychit þe tre ane aker lenth; Now gottyn has þe tre rute Off kynd, to comfort and to bute, And like to beire baith frute and flour, Vntill oure help and oure succour, Sene Saxons in þe Scottis blude Is samyn in ?one frely fude, Dame Mald, oure quene and oure lady, Now weddit with our king Henry.” This auld knycht sittand at þe burd All þis rehersit word be word. In this tyme þe translatioun Wes maid with veneracioun Off Sanct Cuthbert to Durehame, Be prelatis of commendit fame, Fra þe kirk of Haly Heland, Quhare he befor þat wes lyand. Thare Alexander, our kingis broþer, At þat translacioun wes with oþer. To Durhame þan the bischopis se Fra þin wes ordanit for to be. CHAPTER CXXVII. Off Alexander þe ferss oure king And of seire cornyklis following. A thousand a hunder ?eris and sevin Fra cast wes borne þe King of Hevin, Off Edgare, oure noble king, The dais wiþ honour tuke ending; Off north half Tay in to Dunde To God his spirit commendit he, And in the kirk of Dunfermelyne Solempnitly he wes beryit syne. Lemman had he nane, nor wif, Bot clene and honest wes his lif, And full gracius wes his ending. Nixt efter him wes crovnit king Alexander his broþer ?ing þan, That wes a full hie hertit man. King he regnyt xvii. ?ere In honour and in gret powere. To wif he weddit in that quhile A faire lady, Dame Sybill, That William Bastardis dochter wes, That wan all Ingland mare and less. Scho wes his dochter of full bed, Henryis sister and William Rede. This Alexander wes rycht manly; Alexander þe Fersy forthi He wes callit for þis ressoun. At Inuergowry a sesoun With ane honest court he baid, For þare a manere place he haid, And all þat land lyand þar by Wes his demayne þan halely. Sua sodanely apon him þen A cumpany come of the Ylis men, In entent for to sla þe king; Bot of þar come he gat wittering. He had nocht with him þan him by Bot his awne court solemply, Bot ?it he counterit þaim in hy, And put þaim to þe ware suthly; And to þe Stokfurd in to Ross He chasit þaim, and on set purposs Thai stottit þare, for þai were ma Than he, and thocht him for to sla. Bot, quhen þai saw him cum sa fast, Off his cummyn þai were agast, And turnyt all þe bak and fled. Oure þat watter þai þaim sped, And þan þe se begouth to fyll That he to þaim mycht nocht wyn till; Neuertheles rycht at þat tyde Oure þat watter can he ryde With his court, and apertly On þaim he chasit, and fellonly He followit þaim, till at þe last He tuke and slew þaim, or he past Out of þe Ilis, and gert þaim bow Till his bidding and his prow, And delt sa wiþ þaim at few he left To tak on hand sic purposs eft. Fra þat day furth his liegis all Vsit him þe Ferss to call. Syne he sped him in all hy Hame agane to Inuergowry, And for deuocioun of þis thing done He foundit þe abbay þan of Scone, And fra Sanct Oswald of Ingland He brocht channons to be seruand To God and Sanct Mychaell, regulare Efter Sanct Augustynis ordinare. Fra þin furþ he had in delyte Haly stedis to vesite, And þaim till honour in ornamentis, As iowellis, bukis and gud vestmentis.

This Henry couth nocht haif in mynd, Bot baire him velaus and vnkynd Till William, Dauidis sone sone; That, fra he had him in presone done, Demanit him dispituously, And gert his barnage halely To vnlefull thingis consent That were all inconuenient, Baith to ressone and to law, That þai maid for neid and aw, That tretit þar king in dispite, Or þai mycht get him of presoun quyt, Be ony maner of trete, To bring him hame in his cuntre. A thousand a hundreth and sevinty ?ere And viii. to þai to rekin cleire, Richart of Sanctandrois þan Bischop, commendit a gud man, His spreit [?alde] till his Creature, His corps till hallowit sepulture, Evin apon þe thrid day Off þe moneth men callis May. In till Sanctandrois kirk he lyis, His spirit in till Paradiss. He wes, all tyme at he liffit heire, Off þe kirk a stark pillere, And defendit his kirk weill In all fredomes ilk deill. This Bischop Richart þus wiss dede, Chosin wes þan in his steid Maister Iohne Scot, þat wes þan A gret clerk and a famouss man. Bot oure King William neuerþeles Hely agane him muffit wes, And stude þis gret clerk ay agane In fawour of his awne chaplane That wes his confessour, Schir Hew, A gud man als of gret vertew.

And of his consecratioun Alexander þe thrid pape Wrait to Master Mathou, bischap That tyme of Abirdene, This papis letre? red and sene, This lite but delay he suld bles, Sen he confermyt and chosin wes. Thus þis Iohne confermyt bischap, This Alexander, þat tyme pape, Send with him a messengere In Scotland to knaw of þat matere, For reuerens of Sanctandrois se, And of þe kingis dignite. The messingere þat wes send for this Be name wes hattyn Alixis, That with Iohne þe bischop come In Scotland fra þe court of Rome, Haiffand full auctorite And powere fra þe papis se All þat mater for to knaw, And do þat suld be done of law. Thus quhen þai come in to þe land, The King William of Scotland Hiely stude ?it þaim agane, In fawour of his avne chaplane; And sa wes gret consaillis seire Haldin oft of þis matere Be þis legatis auctorite; And sa with law procedit he That efter gret grevouss excess, That oftsyss done to þaim wes, Gret clerkis of þe kingis counsaill, Chosin till him for speciall, Cursit were solemply, And denunsit opinly, For þe kingis wilfulnes. The bischoprik of Sanctandrois wes Interdytit þan a quhile; Thus stude it in to þat perile Till þe bischop of Abirdene, Fra he þe papis letre? had sene, Passit till Halyrudhouss, Quhare gaderit were mony religiouss, Abbotis, priouris, and prelatis, And bischopis of hiear estatis.

To þis [King Henry] of Yngland, That in þat tyme wes þan regnand, Off evin consanguinite The thrid and thrid wes scho and he. Off Sanct Patrik, Sanct Colme, and Sanct Bride The bodyis were fundin in þat tyde. The castell of Edinburcht in þai dais Wes gevin agane, þe story sais, To þe King William of Scotland. And þis King Henry of Ingland To Carlele come wiþ his powere, In till entent for to mak weire Off Rolland, lord þan of Gallway, That him withdrew fra Inglis fay. Bot vnder coundit throu tretee To speking to þat king come he; And of leif of his lord þe king, That Scotland had in gouernyng, Fra William þare he maid homage Till Henry for his heretage. Oure king him leiffit to mak þat band For þai twa kingis were tretand Off gretare thingis like to be Full accordit in all degre. Than of Iulii þe secund day Betuix þis Rolland of Galway And Gylpatrik a batall [fell] Wes done, baith saire and scharp and snell, Quhare þis Gilpatrik slane wes þare, And mony þat wiþ him þat day ware. A thousand a hundreth foure score and nyne Fra lichtare wes þe clene Virgyne, Off Ingland þan þis Henry king Deit, and his lif tuke ending; Xxx. ?eris he wes and five King of Ingland in his live. And quhen þat he wes þusgatis dede, For to be borne vnto þe steid Ordanit for his sepulture, As suld a king be with honour, His body wes cled oure haill In till kingis apparaill, Fra his hede till his feit doune, Haiffand þaron of gold a crovne, And gluffis on his handis twa, Beltit with his suerd alsua, Septure, ryng, gluffis, and sadaill Browdin oure wiþ goldal haill; Bot his visage wes all baire. Thus borne wiþ lordis þat were þare To þe steid of his sepultoure With all worschip and honour, Richart, his sone and his aire, With his court plesand and faire, Met his fader on þe way. Than of þat deid corss, as it lay, Out at þe neiss thrillis twa The reid blude bristit out, þat swa Fast it bled þat all þarby Off þat thing thocht gret [ferly], And vmbekest in þare entent; Bot þare wes na certane iugisment, Bot at it like wes to be sene That his spreit wes movit in tene Off þe fader agane þe sone. ?it neuerþeles þocht it þus done, This Richard past on, sighand saire, With þe lordis at þe body baire, To þe steid of his sepulture, And it in entyrit with honour. And fra þat it wes done, als fast To Lundone þan þis Richard past, And tuke þe crovne þare in þe steid Off his fader þat wes deid. Thocht he Richart to name wes cald, He wes a stout knycht and a bald, And prysit of rycht hie renovne, Richart þe hert of a lyoun, Or Lyons Hert, to say schortly, His pepill callit him commonly. Till oure King William he was Luffit and fallow in all prowes; For thy þai were ay till oþer Als speciall as broþer to broþer. Our King William þan tretit swa With þis Richart at he gat fra Him alhaill his digniteis, His staitis als and oþer feis, With his gret castellis twa, Berwik and Roxburcht were þai, And frely alsua his ostage; And quytclamyt all homage, And all oþer condicionis, That Henry be extorsionis Off William þe king of Scotland had, Wnder his dangere till he baid. Ten thousand merkis of oure money Oure king þarfor gert payit be. Off all þir pointtis euerilkane As þai were tretit to be oure tane, And to be haldin ferme and stable, Richart vndir his seill, but fable, As a quytclame faire and fre, Be his letter and seill gaif he; And oþer mony fredomes ma In þat letter is put alsua, The quhilkis I leif as now to writt; For as of it to hald þe dyte Word be word, or tyme be tyme, I can nocht lichtly bring in ryme. Bot quhasa likis it to wit, To þe Register I him remytt; For in till it is writtin weill All þai pointtis ilk deill. Phillip þat ?ere, king of France, To þe King Richart in allyance Wes bunding togidder for to ga With power of þare realmes twa To werray in þe Halyland. And on þis purpos þai passand Togidder þat tyme in Almayne, Richart of Ingland king wes tane, And wes halding þan in presoun, Sa langtyme þat for his ransoun All þe jowellis precius Baith of secularis and religiouss, As of ilk famouss place That of Ingland oure all was, And alsua þe chalicis syne Off siluer or of gold sa fyne, Bot ane to serfe in kirkis thre, Wes left throu all þe haill cuntre, Than þai were gevin for his ransoun Or euer þat he come of presoun.

That tyme þis Philip king of France Wes nocht sa taryit wiþ sic chance; Bot come hame in his avne land, This Richart in to presoun beand. Men said þat betuix þaim stythly Bandis wes maid of cumpany, Quhare throu þat tyme þare vyage Thai tuke togidder and þar passage. Bot fra þis Phillip wes cummyn hame, He wes to rekles of his fame; For he assemblit his powere, And went in Ingland apon weire, And tuke vp þare citeis and tovnys, Castellis alsua and presonis, And all þe land of Normundy, Brekand all band of cumpany. And þare he fylit his gud fame, And lesit all his noble name. Thare fell ane of his floure de lice, To do his fallow sic suppriss, Methink, þarto quha wald ta keip, That bunding wes of fallouschip. A thousand a hundreth nynty and four ?eris fra oure Saluyour Wes borne, þan out of presoun fre This Richart lovsit hame come he; And quhen þat he wes cummyn hame, Till him come oure King William With lordis of his land mony; This Richart thankit him gretly. In Normundy eftir als fast This Richart wiþ gret powere past, And to þat cuntre he maid him knawin; For quhy he clamyt it as his avne. Off Scotland þan oure King William Renewit his money at hame.

Quhen Iohne þat tyme of Ingland king Off þis had gottin full wittering, All þe monkis of þis abbay Quyte he banyst þaim away, And all þare rentis reft þaim fra, And of þe bischoprik alsua All he maid till him as chete, As it had fallin till him forfeit. Than to þe papis eris sone Come sone word how he had done. Than eftir gret monicionis, And diuerss extorsionis, To Canterbery kirk to restore Monkis and all, as wes befor; Bot ?it to þis obeyit he nocht, As he suld do of det and mocht; The pape cursit him solemply, And interditit halely All þe kirkis of Ingland; Na preistis to be þarin singand, Na sacrament in word nor deid, Bot þat at suld be done of neid, This is bapteme and pennance ay, Namely in þe latter day. All bischopis he banyst but reuerens, That executouris wer of þis sentence, Out of þe kinrik of Ingland. In his wodnes þus wedand, And to be vengeit likandly At his will of þe clergy, All þe preistis women he For a gret sovme of money Sald on till a wickit man, Callit Robert of Dayles þan; And quhat be him and þaim, but weire, All Ingland þai maid on steire. Phillip þan, þe king of France, In þe tyme of þis distance, The pape bad, in remissioun Off his synnis, to mak him bovne To pass þan in till Ingland, And tak þe realme haill in his hand. Quhen he wes on þis purposs set, The erll of Flandris maid him let; For men said corrumpit wes he With þe king of Inglandis fee. Sa wes he lettit throu þat wage That haly lettit þat passage. Quhat wes þare mare? Bot eftir þat, In till Ingland a gret legat On purposs fra þe court of Rome Off counsall and of tretiss come. To þis þare mycht be done na less, For all þe trety þat þare was, Till þis King Iohne halely, For his wilfull contumacy, Forouth ony absolutioun, Or ony oþer remissioun, Na maner of thing passand befor, Till he þe monkis gert restore Agane frely to þar abbay, Quharfra þai banyst were away, With all þe possessionis and rentis, And all oþer fredomes and asiamentis, And at þe archbischop suld be Frely duelland at his se. And þir were bot for þe actionis That of law langit to þai personis That were agreiffit throu þe king, And supprisit in gret thing.

And so þai hangit him by þe hals; ?it of his saw he wes nocht fals; For quhy, he suld na king be cald, Nor na man suld him for king hald, That baith his rialte and his land Wes till ane oþer obeyand, And had it gevin all fra him quyt, Makand him self a subdit. How suld he be callit a king That maid him self ane vnderling? ?it þan þis carle neuerþeles For his soth saw hangit wes.

A thousand ii?. xv. ?ere Eftir þe birth of oure Lord deire, Quhen þat King William þus wes deid, Alexander his sone in his steid Succedit till him, and tuke þe crovne Off Scotland, and full possessioun, As his elderis befor had done, With honour in þe kirk of Scone. That ilk ?ere þare fell gret discord Betuix þe baronis and þare lord, Off Ingland Iohne þat wes king, That þaim supprisit in gret thing, And did þaim wrangis on mony wiss Agane þar lawis and þare franchis. And in þe tyme of þis distance Thai tretit with þe king of France, That he wald gif þaim his counsall, And als his help and suppowall; And þai suld all becum his men. The king of France assentit þen, And resauit þare fewte, And ostage gret of þaim tuke he. And quhen þat he had sagatis done, Lowes, his aire and eldest sone, With navyne past to þe se, And in Ingland aryvit he With a gret multitud of men Rycht weill arrayit for þe weire þen. And oure King Alexander of Scotland Raid throu Ingland wiþ strang hand Straucht to Dovir on þe south se. As at trist þare set met he With Lowes þe kingis sone of France. Thare maid þai speciall quayntance, And all þe lordis on athir syde Were blith and ioyfull at þat tyde; And quhen þai had togidder bene A weill lang quhile, wiþoutin weyne, Oure King Alexander als fast Hame toward his avne land past With all his folkis; bot neuerþeles The wayis befor him stoppit wes With gret powere of Inglismen; Bot ?it ay throu þaim held he þen; Throu Goddis grace and manheid he Come hame haill in his avne cuntre, And wan þe castell of Carlele; And all þe toune of it rycht weill He stuffit with men and wittaill, And tuke þe cuntre till him haill. A thousand twa hundreth ?eris and sextene Fra God wes borne of Mary clene, Off Iohne þat tyme of Ingland king The lif at New Wark tuke ending. And þan the pape Honorius Herd at þe king of France wes þus Hely muffit agane Ingland, And þare throu him gret scaith takand. A cardinall fra þe court he send The rycht of it thare to defend; Galo men callit þat cardynall, Till Ingland he wes richt speciall; And in till Ingland quhen he come Chargeit sa fra the pape of Rome, Haiffand þe papis full powere In till thingis þat lefull were, The King Iohne þan fand he deid. Than hastely in till his steid Henry he crovnit, þis Iohnis sone, In Wynchester; bot, quhen þat wes done, The king of Francis sone Lowes, Throu strenth of armes and of priss, And als throu Inglismenis fauour, Off Lundonnun wan baith toune and toure. Him self baid þarin duelland, Bot his ost Lincolum lay segeand. In to þat ost of gret powere Baith Inglis and Franche togidder were Bunding, as in ane opinioun, And haly set to wyn þat toune. Galo þis cardinall and legat, That saw þar purpos þai on set, With all þe king of Inglandis mycht He schupe him to þe cete rycht, And with him þidder come bodely The new crovnyt King Henry. All with bolnyng, brag and bost, Thai brak apon þe Franche ost, And scalit all þat segis sone; And eftir þat, but langere hone, All þe Inglismen þat þare ware Thai tuke or slew, or presonit saire; And als a mychti erll of France Hapnyt to be slane in þat chance. And all þe Inglismen þat fled þin Held to þe se; bot þe navyne Off France wes won or þat þai come; So were þare hertis out of home. Thare wes þe admirall slane of þe flot, And all þe laif in þat ryot, That þai in to þai schippis fand, Thai leit nocht ane pass to þe land, Bot slang þaim smertly all oure burde; For of þaim wald þai mak na hurde. And eftir þat þare fell trete With þir folkis þat away couþ fle, That were native Inglismen; And þusgatis it wes tretit þen That lordis, and knychtis, and squyeris, That had bene rebell in þai weris Within þe tyme of þat distance With þe kingis sone, Lowes of France, Suld haif fully þe kingis pess For all þat to þat day done wes, And suld haif full restitucionis Off landis, gudis and possessionis, That were þairis befor þan, Or thai weris first began; And Lowes þan suld ransound be. This wes þe sovme of þat trete. This Galo richt speciall Till Ingland, as I tald ?ow haill, Bot till Scotland full dispitiouss He wes all tyme and invyouss.

[A] thousand ?ere and hundrethis twa Foure score and þe sext to þai, The sextene day eftir Pasche, The statis of Scotland semblit was, And gaderit haly þan at Scone, Fra þe King Alexanderis dais wes done, As to þat a set Parliament. Thare þai ordanit wiþ ane assent And maid þare wardanis thre, Quham throu þe land suld gouernyt be: Twa bischopis, and erllis twa, Twa baronis gret to þaim alsua.

Off Dunkelde? þe bischop þen A wardane wes to þir, be s? men. Till þe kinrik wes þus wacand, Off Ingland þe king wes þan thinkand, With þe langshankis callit Edwart, How he mycht euir wiþ strenth or art Apply our kinrik till his crovne; This wes his ymaginatioun. Than kest he till haif a mariage, And þaron ordanit gret message In Scotland to cum. Bischopis twa, Off Durhame and Carleill wer þai, Twa erllis, and twa gret baronis, Famouss and mychty personis, Come in Scotland in message, To trete and mak a mariage, With gret profferis, to be done Betuix þe king of Inglandis sone, Edwart callit of Carnauerane, Prince of Walis he wes þan, For to be weddit with þat may The kingis dochter of Norway, Mergret callit, þe madyn faire, To Scotland and Norway rychtuiss aire. This wes þe sowme of þar erand, Fra þar king chargeit of Ingland, Proponit be þare instructionis, Thir forsaid famouss gret personis. Than þe estatis assemblit of our land, That herd þis charge and þis erand, And sone assentit to þare will That ilk mariage to fulfill With specifiit condicionis, Vnder gret protestacionis That þare chargis and þare tretiss, Na þare assent vpo? na wiss, Suld na preiudice þan be To þe kinrik of Scotland fre; Bot it suld ioiss in all fredomes Thare franchis, proffectis and customes Als frely as þai befor, In þe tyme of gud memor Off Alexander last our king, That Scotland had in gouernyng, Or forouth him o? ony wiss Maist vsit þare franchis. Baith þir partyis wiþ trew entent Gaif to þis þare full assent. And als fast as þis wes done, A message wes ordanit to pas sone Oure þe see þan in Norway To bring in Scotland þat faire may, The king of Norwayis dochtir faire, Off Scotland and Norway richtuiss aire, Margret callit þe madin ?ing, The dochtir dochtir of our king Alexander of gud memor, As ?e haif herd rehersit befor. To do þis message wes ordanit then Twa honorable knychtis, twa wiss men; Duelland in Fife were þai twa, And þir þe names were of þai: Off þe Wemys Schir Davy, Schire Mychell Scot of Balwery; Thir twa weill commendit men, And trowit weill of lawte þen.

Thare lawis writtin ?it neuirþeles All contrar and agane þis wes. The Norwayis has a writtin buke Off þar lawis, quharein þai luke All casis happinnand, as þai fall, And be þat text þai hald þaim all Thai casis but excepcionis; By þat is nane evasionis. And be þare lawis þan þai fand That þe female to aire þar land Be lyne discendand, forouth maill Succeid suld befor collaterall. Bot þouch þis writtin wes in þar buke, This wald þai noþir hald nor luke, For fellony þai wald nocht hald Thare lawis, þat writtin were of ald; And þus þir knychtis, þat passit in vane, Come hame in Scotland sone agane. CHAPTER CXXXVII. Off þe lauchfull successioun Off Bruss or Ballioll to þe crovne. [A]lexander oure king wes deid That Scotland had to steire and leid; The land sex ?ere, and mare perfay, Wes desolat eftir his day; Till þat þe barnage at þe last Assemblit þaim, and fayndit fast To cheiss a king þare land to steire, That of ancestry cummyn wer Off kingis þat aucht þat ryalte, And mast had richt þar king to be. Bot envy, þat is sa felloun, Maid amangis þaim descencioun; For sum wald haif þe Ballioll king, For he wes cummyn of þe ofspring Off hir þat eldest sister wes; And other sum nyte all þat cas, And said at he þare king suld be That wes in als neire degre, And cummyn als of þe narrest male As be branche collaterall. For þai said successioun of kinrik Wes nocht to lawere feis like, As duchery, erldome or barony, Or ony lawere fee; forthy Thai said succeid suld na female, Till funding mycht be ony male Off þat blude ryall, to þat he Were ferrare cummyn be a gre, As ?e may fynd writtin in þis buke, All thir nixt followand quha will luke. [T]han þe estatis of Scotland, Till þare kinrik wes þus vacand, Assemblit and assentit haill Throu þare alleris haill counsell, And maid a compromyssioun To put þis in þe discretioun Off Edward, king of Ingland, That oblist him be faithfull band Off aith and treuth and lele lawte The richt to gere declarit be, Off þe lauchfull successioun Off Scotland for to ioiss þe crovne, Off þe Balliole, and of Robert The Broiss, þat regnyt eftirwart; As wes commyttit for to be Declarit, forþi besy wes he To get knawlege of þis resoun, Quha suld fall þat successioun, Than in France to þe presedentis, And to lordis of þe Parliamentis, And to seire vthir þat were þen Kend þare all vthir wysest men, And to þe Vniuersite Off Pariss, þis case wrait he: Off a kinrik a king of det, Nocht crovnyt, na vntit, bot sympilly set In to þat sete be sum personis Off bischopis, erllis, or of baronis, Off þe estatis of his land, Sa to be as a king regnand, Deit, but aire of his body Gottin to succeid lynyaly. This king in fee and heretage That kinrik held, and maid homage Till a gretare king of mycht, That wes his ourelord of rycht. And quhen þis king all þus wes deid, For to succeid in till his steid Thare come twa men, baith he and he, Sayand þat aire þai aucht to be To þe kinrik, to beire þe crovne, And bruke it in possessioun. This ilk kinrik, þus vakand, The ourelord tuke in till his hand, Till þat he mycht clerely knaw Quha suld succeid till it of law. Than forouth þis king, þat wes þen Ourelard of it, come twa men, That cousingis were collaterall To þe king deid, nocht lyneall. The first proponit þus in forme faire, And said at he wes narrest aire Befor þe toþer to beire þe crovne, Principally be this ressoune: A king callit Malcome Canmor, That ?it lestis in gud memor, Quhen he as king þe kinrik led, Had a broþer of lauchfull bed, And þat broþer had dochteris twa Lauchfull, and “þe first of þai But dout,” he said, “my moder baire; Quharfor but weire I am narrare Than ony oþer to beire þe crovne Be richt richt of successioun Off þis kinrik now vakand.” The toþer herd, at by couþ stand; Quhen þus for his part he had done, He maid þis ansuere scharp and sone: “That ?e haif said, I haif herd weill, And has consauit it ilk deill. I grant,” quod he, “þe antecedens; Bot I deny the consequens. At þat lord had dochteris twa, I grant, and at þe first of þai In hir first birth ?our moder baire I grant; bot ?e said forthirmare, That ?e þarfor suld bere þe crovne. Bot þat wald noþer law, nor ressoun: For quhy, successioun of kinrik Is nocht to laware feis like; ?our moder and I in evinlik gre Descendand fra þe stok ar we; And be law suld na female Succeid, gif þare be ony maill Funding of evinlik gre For to posseid þat ryalte. The eldest sister ?our moder baire; My moder, hir sister, wes ?oungare; Sa to þe stok I am nevow; Pronewow ?e ar. Be þat allow ?e ar nocht sa neire to þe crovne As I be richt of successioun. My lady, ?our gudame, wes my ant; The eldest sister scho wes, I grant; Scho baire ?our moder, þat wes woman; Bot my moder first baire þe man. Be ?e crovnyt king, and nocht I, Than am I wrangit gretumly. The law of ciuile na cannoune Giffis for ?oure part na ressoun; Na ?it na custome in na kinrik Makis ?our part na myn evinlik, That þe female in evinlik gre Preferrit to þe male suld be, Na of þe maill þe pronevow Suld be preferrit to þe nevow. Ioiss ?e þe croune sa, and nocht I, Wrangit I call me richt hely.” Quhasa þis thing will vnderstand, Off þe Bruss þare wes liffand Fra þat tyme to þis Robertis thre; And þe eldest þan wes he That maid þis altercatioun In his richt of successioun. Nevo in Inglis to haif vndone, Is noþer broþer na sister sone; Bot fra þe stok evinlely Personis discendand lynyaly In þe toþer, or þe thrid, gre, Nevow, or pronevow, suld be, As for to call þe sonnys sone; Off þe dochtir sa to be done Hir sone may be callit nevow; This [is] of þat word þe vertew. Quhen on þis wiss þire personis twa, The Bruss, þe Ballioll, baith were þai, Befor Edward of Ingland king Had maid on þis wiss þar carping, The effect oure þe se he wrait, To haif counsall of þis debait. Bot he maid fals suggestioun; Full fals wes his relatioun, And þaim enformyt full falsly, Settand þe cace full swikfully; Quhen he said þat in heretage Oure kinrik wes haldin for homage Aucht till a king of gretare mycht, He said þare fals and na thing rycht. The kinrik þat he þat taill of maid, As he in France þan writtin had, Withoutin dout wes ay mare fre Than wes þe kinrik þat held he. He was neuer worth, na all his kyn, The fredome fra þat realme to wyn. He savit ill his honeste, To sclander swa a kinrik fre. Had he thocht on his grantschir Iohne, Quhat he did in his tyme þan gone, Quhen he rebellit þe pape of Rome, And of him held syne his kingdome, He suld haif worthin reid for schame, Oure kinrik fre for to defame. CHAPTER CXXXVIII. How King Edward gaif fals sentens Agane þe Bruss but consciens. [T]he clergy and þe wit of France, Fra þai consauit þis distans, And all þis strif and þis debait, As þis King Edwart to þaim wrait, Thai kest þame haly to declare Off þat successioun þe matare. The bischop þan of Orlians, A solempne clerk in seire sciens, Maister in art and in morall, And in theology and naturall, And foundit alsua perfitly In philosophy as theology, A solempne doctour als þat quhile Baith in cannone and in ciuile. This ilk mater to declare, First he said on þis manare: “In þe kinrik of Scotland, That, as ?e herd, is now vacand, Gif custum appruffit may be knawin, And certane by all lawis drawin, How of þat kinrik suld þe croune Follow in till successioun In ony lyne descendand Fro þe stok, or ascendand, Evin in successioun lynyall, Or in branche collaterall, The first, or þe first in gre, As þai may happin, scho or he, Or ?it þai sa gottin and borne, That custum of þat realme beforne Suld be preferrit, and haldin ay Agane all at þe law may say; For þat custum all by drawis That ar writtin in þe lawis. Bot gif þat þare be custum nane, With law þe causs may be ourtane. Than were it to þe common law That is imperiall, erast draw. Be þat law, but dout, ?e ken That, quhare þar cumis in pley twa men, Askand þe croune of a kinrik, Quhareto na laware feis ar like, In till branchis collaterall, Nocht in successioun lyneall, To þe king neire, þat wes deid, And to succeid in till his steid, Nocht breþer, na breþer barnis ar, Bot in þare greis ar ferrare, But dout, þe nixt male in þat gre Preferrit to þe crovne suld be, Nocht aganestandand þat þe eldare Off twa dochteris a dochtir baire.” To þis þe bischop of Pariss, That wes a gret clerk and a wiss, And othir solempne clerkis twa, As said þe first, sa said all þai. Nixt þaim þe Provest of Merciall, Doctour in cannone and in ciuile, Said: “In þe caiss of þai twa men, That askit þe crovne of Scotland þen, Be writtin lawis imperiall, And appruffit custum, vsuall In till all þe realme of Frans, Quhen þar fallis sic distance In gretare greis, or smallare, Quha funding is in gre nerrare, The secund sone set at he be, Or he be ferrer in sum degre, Gif he be fundin in gre nerrare Till him, þat is of birth ferrare, He sall haif þe prerogative, Gif liffand be þe stok on live, As to be full aire at þe lest; Set cummyn þar be of þe eldest Broþer or dochtir twa or ma, The gre befor þe birth sall ga. And þat tuke steid in sic distans,” Said þe provest, “in þe realme of Frans. The king befor þan, Schir Lowis, Be counsall, at he knew wes wiss, Quhen he a sone had, Phillip cald, That wes a stout knycht and a bald, And þis Phillip had sonnis ma, Lauchtfull gottin, þan ane or twa, Off Phillippis sonnis þe eldare Befor Phillippis broþer ?oungare Wend till haue [bene] to þe crovne Nixt Lowis in successioun; This Phillip fader þan liffand, And in till France þan king regnand, Had a ?oungare sone þan liffand, As I befor þis baire on hand. This ilk maner in to Frans Takis steid,” he said, “in sic distans, And in ma courtis like till it, Baith be custum of law and writt, That gif þe eldare sone of þai twa, Haiffand sonnis ane or ma, Dee, his fader ?it liffand, The fader syne de of his land, The ?oungare broþer liffand in steid Succedis all till his faderis deid, And nocht his eldare broþer sone; This vse wes haldin in France and done. This makis for þe Bruss Robart, And nocht for þe Balliollis part; For nerrar to þe stok wes he Than wes þe Ballioll be a gre, And richtsua til William our king, That Scotland had in gouernyng.” Thir wismen said ?it neuerþeles, Gif sic custum in Scotland wes, That þe first get in alkin gre, Nerrar or ferrare quheþer it be, Suld gif sic prerogatiffis To sic gret richtis successiffis, That samyn custum ilk deill Specially suld be kepit and weill, And haldin in all propirte, As it ofttyme mycht knawin be, Preferrit to lawis imperiall, Cannone, or oþer custummall, Or vsit in oure cuntreis, Writtin and haldin for sic feis. ?it attour þis þai sperit mare At þaim, þat to þaim chargeit war; In þat cass at þire twa men At askit þe kinrik of Scotland þen, Gif þai had witting, herd, or sene, That ony custum optenit had bene Befor þat tyme of sic a cass, Or gif in Scotland befor þan was A cass in all thingis falling sa like, As wes þan of þat kinrik, Supposs þat of lawar feis, As ducheryis, erldomes or baronyis, Sic cass oftsyss were falland, And to þare ourelordis pertenand. Thai ansuerd þan at neuer befor Wes had of sic a cass memor, As to succeid till a kinrik; Forþi till it þai herd nane like. Bot þai, þat maid þis relatioun, Be þare swikfull suggestioun Gert þire wissmen vnderstand That þe kinrik of Scotland Suld of þe king of Ingland be Haldin in heretage, and fee; And in till his court forthy This caiss aucht to be fullely Pledid befor him as ourelard, And he of law to gif a ward For ane of þai twa, þan askand The successioun of Scotland; And be sic custum as wes þan, And in þe realme of Ingland ran, The richt of þat successioun Suld haif determinatioun. Supposs þis cass wes set all fals, This ensampill þai tuke in als: The Duke of Bullone, a noble man, The fader of him þat duke wes þan, Off lauchfull bed had sonnis twa; And þe eldare sone of þai Had a dochtir, and to reherss, The Erll hir weddit of Nywers. Sone eftir deit þis eldest sone; Bot lang eftir his dais wes done, The duke his fader wes liffand, And in his duchery þe stait haldand. Bot eftir quhen þis duke wes deid, This Erll of Nywerss in his steid Askit be ressoun of his wif The duchery of Bullone but mare strif; Sen scho wes of þe eldare sone The eldare dochtir, [þat] to be done He askit: for he said þat na man Wes nerrare to þat lordschip þan, Be appruffit custum in þat duchery Off Bullone, þat he askit trewly. Quhen he had askit, þe ?oungare Off þire twa sonnys maid ansuare, And said þe custum he knew weill Vsit in Bullone ilk deill Off þe tennendis in þat land, That þare feis were haldand Off þe duke him self in cheif, For ward, or seruice, or releif. That ilk custum suld oureta And bynd his tennendis, and na ma Bot þe dukis awne subditis. That custum wes nocht worth thre mytis. Quha suld of Bullone, he said, be duke, He suld nocht to þat custum luke, Na it aval?eit nocht in þat distance; Bot in the kingis court of France Declarit, he said, þat cass suld be, Sen þat ilk duchery, said he, In fee wes haldin of the king, That France had ay in gouernyng, And of rycht richt wes ourelard. Off it he wald þare ask award, Be custum of France quheþer he or he Suld bruke be law þat duchery fre. Than in þe tyme of þis distans In till Pariss þe king of Frans This ?oungare broþer gert weddit be With his sister, a lady fre. This erll, þat saw þis led sa, Wend weill þe law wald fra him ga; And for of gold a gret portioun Tretit, and gaif vp his actioun. Richtsua þir wismen vnderstude That in lik caiss þis mater ?ude Off þe kinrik of Scotland, That, as þai herd, wes þan vakand; The king of Ingland suld of law All þe debait, as ourelord, knaw. Supposs be fals relatioun Thai had þare informatioun, As þai had rypit materis seire, The cass of Scotland þai maid clere. Forthi togidder in a sentens, The bischop of Orlyans, And till him oþer bischopis twa, Off Pariss and Carcason wer þai, And xi. in till hie greis Famouss men in faculteis, With oþer gret men, presidentis, And peris of þe parliamentis, Thare names can I nocht all declare, For þai ar strange to ?ow to heire, To tell as I þaim writtin fand; Thai ar nocht eith till vnderstand, Na for till haif of þaim knawlege Expremyt in till oure langage; Bot, wit ?e, þai were all gret men, And famouss in hie statis þen. Forthy þis cass wes specially Put to þaim in þare study; This mater in þare faculteis Thai socht, and in þe buke of feis, Makand mony distinctionis, And argumentis in collationis, Ilka clerk in his sciens; And syne concludit in a sentens, And be ensampillis set befor, Gif thai abyde in ?our memore, That þe custum of ilk land Appruffit fermely suld stand, And aw to be preferrit ay, All þat men of law may say. For custum appruffit oft by drawis Off cannone and ciuile baith þe lawis; Forthy haldis clerkis by þare saw That custum is þe toþer law. Gif of a cass were custum nane, With law þe cass maybe ourtane Off cannone or imperiall, Or be gret ressonis naturall. All þire clerkis in þare greis, And wissmen in þare faculteis, Be all ensamplis forouth set, I trow ?e haif þaim nocht for?et, Maid fynaly deliuerans, And send þaim writtin out of France To King Edward of Ingland, That, þai wist, wes it bydand: That to þe stok þe nerrest maill Suld ioiss þe crovne and stait alhaill As in successioun of kinrik, Quhareto na laware feis ar like. And of þe ordouris of þe Freris, Augustynis, and Cordyleris, And be þe blak ordour Iacobitis, And alsua þe quhit Carmelitis, Gret masteris of diuinite, Socht þis caiss in þar faculte. Off þe Bibill als þe ferd buke Thai kest vp, þis ilk cass to luke. That buke is callit Numery; Off Salphat þare is þe story; The xxvii. chapitere, And þus it tellis þe manere. Quhen Moyses and Elea?are, And all þe princis of Ioware ware Within þe tabernakle haill Togidder gaderit in counsall, Off þis Salphat dochteris five To þe dure come þan belive, And standand þare befor Moyses On þis manere þar asking wes: “Oure fader Salphat in his live Had na sone, bot we his dochteris five; And in the helping wes he nocht That Chore agane Moyses wrocht, Quhen in þe erd wes sonking þan Chore, Abyrone, and Dathan; Oure fader Salphat neuertheles Deit but sone in wildernes. And supposs þat he deit but sone, Quhy suld his name be all fordone, That wes famouss in his quhile Amangis his kyne and his famyle? Sum possessionis gif ws þarfor Oure fader name for to restore, Amangis oure avne kyn and our kyth Oure fader name to raiss þarwith.” With þis Moyses als fast For till haif counsall of God past, And proponit þe asking Off Salphatis dochteris, and þe ?arnyng. And quhen Moyses had askit his bone, This ansuere wes to Moyses done: “Thai madinnis askis rychttuis thing. Forthy, till assyth þare ?arnyng, Gif þame possessioun amang þar kith, Thare fader name to raiss þarwith. Off sic a cass as I ?ow tell Thus to þe folkis of Israell. Quhare man, but sone, of cass were deid, His dochtir suld succeid in his steid, And hald his heretage hir allane. Gif sone or dochtir he had nane, His aire þan suld his broþer be. Gif broþer nor sister nane had he, Na þai na barnis had, ma na myn, Than suld þe narrest of þe kyn Tak and ioiss his heretage, Till him fraþin and his lynnage. The folkis of Israell þov gere knaw And hald it for perpetuall law.” [A]lexander þe thrid our king, That Scotland had in gouernyng, Sone na dochtir left he nane, Broþer na sister all deid had tane, Eme and ant, and mare and myn.

Thus fand þe theolog for his part; Nerrare till Alexander our king wes he Than wes þe Ballioll be a gre, And cummyn alsua of þe male, And þe Ballioll of þe female. The sowmys of theology, The resonis of philosophy, And þe lawis imperiall, Cannone, and custum vsuall, And þe ensamplis forouth set, That I trow ?e haif nocht for?et, Makis all for þe Broisis part, And nocht for þe Ballioll be nane art.

Off laware feis I say nocht sa. The custum appruffit ?e forouth ta; For in branchis collaterall The maill sall ga befor femall. [Q]when all þere gret conclusionis With sindry consultationis, As wes decretit in to Frans On þe debait and þe distans That þan wes rissin in Scotland, At þat tyme wes of king vakand, [Ware] oppinnit to þe audiens Off þis King Eduard wiþ reuerens, Than prevely he eftir send The wisest men þat þan wes kend Within his realme; of þai gert he Thre score, or ma, assemblit be. And þai wiþ all his court als fast To þe marche of Scotland past; And to þe wardanis of Scotland he Send letteris of benygnyte, And prayit þaim with all deligens That þai wald cum till his presens, And at þai wald bring alsua Off þe thre estatis wiþ þaim ma, That of fame were gud personis, Bischopis, erllis and baronis, Honorable burgessis and avenand, Commendit wissmen and cunnand; For þar debait þan, said he, Suld sone declarit and endit be. To do þis thing he come gud speid To Norhame on þe watter of Tweid. The statis of Scotland maid þaim bovne, And come þan till Vpsetlingtoun; And þidder he send þaim sauf condyt, For all perillis to mak þaim quyt, Frely for to cum and ga, At þare avne lust, to and fra. Than our þe watter of Tweid þai raid, And in þe toune of Norhame baid, Waittand þare oportunyte Till þat þai þe king mycht se. And sa þai past on to þe kirk, The erand at þai come to wirk, And schawit þaim þare till his presens, And halsit him wiþ gret reuerens; And he resauit þaim curtasly, And to þaim spak rycht hamelely. Fra he his hamely speche had done, To þaim þare he proponit sone, And said þe superiorite Off Scotland of law his suld be, And prayit þaim of þar gud will Thare consent for to gif þartill; And set ensampillis to þaim þare, To gere þaim draw till him þe mare, Off kingis of Ingland þat beforne Had homage of Scotland, or he wes borne. That, men wist weill, wes all fals, That he rehersit, and callit þaim als Kingis and ourelardis of Scotland, That neuer were sa I dare warrand. And þan Robert bischop of Glasgow, A lord commendit of vertu, Ansuerd him vnabasitly With þare consentis, þat stude by. “Excellent prince,” he said, “and king, ?e ask ws ane vnlefull thing, That is superiorite, We ken rycht nocht quhat þat suld be, That is to say, of our kinrik, The quhilk is in all fredome like Till ony realme þat is mast fre In till all þe Cristianite. Wnder þe sone is na kingdome, Than is Scotland, of mare fredome. Off Scotland our king held euer his stait Off God him self immediat, And of nane oþer meyne personne. Thare is nane erdly king wiþ crovne, That ourelard till oure king suld be In till superiorite. Quhen ?e ws send ?our sauf condit, We trowit of sic demandis quyt. Hidder ar we cummyn at ?our instans To heire declarit þis distans; And gif ?e will nocht in to deid In þis mater now proceid, [Wiþ] ?our leif we mycht pass hame, But ?our displesance, fra Norhame.” To preve counsall þan þis king ?eid, and left of sic asking; And prayit þe statis of our kinrik To pass fraþin vnto Berwik; And þare he hecht þaim in lawte To gere þis cass declarit be. His litill lawte neuerþeles He fylit þare in his process. Oure lordis of Scotland þan als fast At his request to Berwik past, And in þe Trinite Kirk richt þare Befor þis king assemblit ware. Our wardanis with lordis of Scotland, And mony gret lordis of Ingland, And þe mast wismen of þir twa Realmes were semblit þare alsua; Foure score, sum said, or till feware Bot xxiiii., men said, þai ware; And þai were stad till þe gret aith, Set sum of þaim to swere were laith, That, all desait and fraude put by, For lufe or leth, þat lelely, Gif þai couth, þai suld declaire Off þat gret distans þe manare, That wes betuix þe personis twa, The Bruss, and þe Ballioll were þai, Quhilk of þai be successioun Had mast rycht to beire þe crovne. This dout and þe awaymentis Consauit fully of þar ententis, Out of þe kyrk þe king gert pas All, bot þai þat þan suorne was To þat assiss, and þai gert he Weill and straitly kepit be; Than þare come nane noþer in nor out, Bot his avne persone wiþoutin dout. Oftsyss to þaim he maid entre, And lang tyme wiþ þaim walde he be. Sa, furþt quhen he come at þe last, Gret lordis about him gaderit fast, And askit him how all wald be; And he ansuerit to þaim þat he Trowit þe Bruss wald haif þe crovne, As he togidder herd þaim roune. “The Broiss! schir,” quod Antone þe Beke, “Quhat is þat, lord, at ?e speik? Be þe Broiss king, trowis weill me, Ware of Ingland þe ryolte, Thy marche, and þi wallit tovnis, Thy castellis, and þi possessionis. Ken ?e nocht Robert þe Broisses mycht, His wit, his manheid, and his slicht, His kyn within þe realmes twa, Off Scotland and Ingland alsua? Gif Bruss beis king of Scotland, Keip weill þi merchis of Ingland. For and he be, þov sall saire rew That euer of þis begouth þe glew. Lat þov neuer þe Bruss beire þe crovne, Bot þov haif his subiectioun. Thus sais all þar lordis standand by, Supposs þe charge þarof tak I; For and he be king of Scotland, Faire weill þi marchis of Ingland, Na lippin þov neuer in pess to be, Gif þov ioysis þat ryalte.” Quhen þis Antone þe Beke had said, The king consauit, and wes affrayid, And said in Franche, as þan vsit he: “Par la sank Dew, wouz awez chaunte.” “Be Goddis blude,” he said, “?e sang; Sa sall nocht all our gamyn gang.” Than in þis tyrand als fast Agane to þe assiss past, And askit þaim how þai had done; And till him all þai ansuerd sone That þai had maid full deliuerans And leill, as of þat gret distans, And in haill conclusioun Thai ordanit þe Bruse to beire þe crovne. Bot first þis tyrand, as I of spak, Fra he had herd Antone þe Beik, Or he past in to þe counsall, Callit Robert þe Bruss, but faill, And askit him prevely gif he Wald hald Scotland of him in fe And heretage, and his ofspring. Wald he do sa, he suld be king. And þare þe Bruss wiþ schort vissment Refusit it, and fra him went, Sayand: “Sa God him self me saif, The kinrik cuvait I nocht to haif; Bot gif it fall of richt to me, And gif God will at it sa be, I sall als frely in all thing Hald it, as it efferis to a king, Or as my elderis forouth me Held it, in freast ryalte.” This tyrand ansuerd him, and sware That he suld get it neuermare; And to þe Ballioll þan he went, And askit gif he wald assent To hald Scotland of him in fe; And he suld sa do, he king suld be. And he assentit till all his will, Quhare of fell eftir mekle ill. And quhen he had gottin his assent, Agane to þe assiss he went, And askit þaim how þai had done; And þai him ansuerd all but hone That þai with haill conclusioun Had ordanit þe Bruss to beire þe crovne. Thareat he maid him wonder wraith, Haiffand na consciens of his aith That he had suorne, þat in lawte He suld gert it declarit be, And gert þaim þat sentens repeill, That þai decretit had for leill, Set sum of þaim þareto were laith, Agane þe vertu of þare aith, Bot quhat for aw, and quhat for threte, He gert þaim þare decrete retrete, And vndo all þar leill sentens, That þai had gevin of gud consciens Amangis þaim þare in prevete. All þat he gert reuersit be, And gert þaim all say at þe crovne Suld fall as be successioun To Iohne þe Ballioll be þe law, Als fere furþt as þai couþ knaw. Off þaim sone fra he herd þat, Doune in till his sete he sat, As efferis till a king, Off þat cass to mak ending, Forouth him þe partyis baiþ standand, And lordis about him on ilk hand. “God,” he said, “[haiffand] in consciens, Heire I gif now plane sentens, Iohne þe Ballioll to beire þe crovne, Be richt as of successioun, Off þe kinrik of Scotland, That, as ?e wait, is now vakand.” Than ferlyit mony of þat sentens, Swa gevin agane gud consciens, The Erll þan of Glowcester standand, And Robert þe Bruss þan, hand in hand. Neire cousingis þai were, I wiss, That þan were cummyn of twa sisteris, As for to rekin gre be gre, The toþir and þe toþire wes he and he Men callit him Schir Gilbert of Claire; And eftir, quhen mony ?eris passit ware, With King Edward of Carnauerane He come to reskew Striueling þan, And þan wes slane at Bannoburne, Wiþ mony Inglis at þar couþ spurne; And, for he slane wes þare þat day, King Robert for him wes perfay Sumdeill dolorus and pensif, For þai luffit oþer in þar lif, As writtin is in King Robertis buke, Quhasa likis it to luke. The Erll of Glowcister, as I said aire, And Robert þe Bruss togidder war Standand samyn, hand in hand, With oþer lordis by standand, Persauit weill þe falsheid done. Thus to þe king þare said he sone: “Aa! God!” said he, “dredis þov nocht, How mycht it fall in to þi thocht, Befor þe rychtuiss domysday man To deme on þis wiss,” said he þan, “Quhare þe behuffis till appeire, Fell sentens of þi self to heire, That giffis sic sentens of a kinrik, Quhare to nane oþer feis ar like?” Mare þan þis wald he nocht say, Bot turnyt þar bakkis, and ?eid þar way, Baith þe erll and þe Broiss Robert. Bot quhat followit syne eftirwart, How Robert oure king recouerit his land, That occupiit with his fais he fand, And restorit it in all fredome, And till his airis out of thraldome, Quha þat likis of it to wit, To þat buke I þame remyt That Maister Iohne Barbour, of Abirdene Archdene, as mony has sene, His dedis has dytit mare verteously Than I can think in my study, Haldand in all leill suthfastnes, Set he wrait nocht half his process. [M]alcome king quhile of Scotland, In it till he wes king regnand, He tuke Sanct Margaret till his wif. On hir he gat in till his lif Sex sonnis and dochteris twa. In generatioun now to ga, Off þai þe ?oungest wes Davy Oure king; and he gat syne Henry. Befor his fader deit he; Bot he gat lauchfull sonnis thre: Malcome þe Madin wes eldest; Sune William oure king; [þe] ?oungest Wes Davy, þat wes erll throu laugh Off Huntindoun and of þe Garagh. Oure King William eftir þat Alexander his sone lauchfull gat. And þat Alexander Williamis sone Gat Alexander. In him wes done And endit full in his persoune Off William þe generatioun; For he, as ?e herd tell beforne, Throu suddand caiss deit at Kingorne. To Malcome agane now mon we ga, For to speke of his dochteris twa. Off þai þe eldest wes Dame Mald; The Gud Quene wiþ all wes scho cald. Scho wes a plesand faire lady; Scho weddit wes wiþ Schir Henry, That wes William Bastardis sone. Quhen William Redis dais were done, This Henry king wes of Ingland; To þis Dame Mald he wes husband. Men sais þis wes þe resson quhy Scho wes callit þe Gud Quene suthly: For a custum wes in Ingland Wsit, at wes þe folkis greiffand; Scho prayit hir lord thraly þat he Wald of þat custum mak þaim fre. Vpon þis scho him prayit sa fast, Till he assentit at þe last For to grant hir hir asking, Gif scho fulfill wald his ?arnyng. To þat scho hecht scho suld be boune But ony kynd of conditioun; For scho trowit bot honeste, Bot all oþer wayis menyt he. For throu Lundyne he bad hir ryde, Nakit, but claith, in to þat tyde, Bot, gif hir likit, with hir haire, For to covir hir body baire. And scho, þat saw na better bone, Till his bidding grantit sone; And þarto waitit a faire day, Quhen wickit wedderis were away. And als nakit as scho wes borne Scho raid, as scho had hecht beforne; Sa scho fulfillit his bidding, And gat hir will and hir ?arnyng. And becauss of þis bowsumnes Mald þe Gud Quene scho callit was; And hir lord, þe King Henry, Wndid for hir saik all frely The ill custum, saire grevand The commonis þat tyme of Ingland. Hir sister Dame Mary weddit wes With þe Erll of Bullone, Schir Eustas. King Malcome had a broþer bald, That callit wes be name Donald. And quhen King Malcome had maid ending, This Donald fayndit to be king. Edgare, Malcomys sone, forthy Tuke þis Donald dispitously, And demanyt hard his persoune, Till þat he deit in presoune. This Donald gat ?it neuerþeles A dochtir, and Bettow callit wes, And þis ilk Bettow eftir þan Baire a dochtir, and þat woman In þe King Williammys chalmer baid, And to þe quene gret seruice maid. CHAPTER CXXXIX. How Cummynis come first in Scotland, And how þai grew to stait beand. [T]han come thre breþer of Normondy, Faire ?oung men and rycht ioly: With þe King Richart of Ingland The eldest broþer baid wonand; In till Irland past þe toþer; In Scotland baid þe ?oungest broþer, William wes his proper name. Thus duelt he with þe King Williame, The quhilk saw him a faire persoune; Forthy in gret effectioun The king þan had þis ilk man. For vertu he saw in him þan, He maid him, for he wes stark and sture, Kepare of his chalmer dure. Na langage couth he speke clerely, Bot his avne langage of Normundy; Neuerþeles ?it quhen þat he Wald opin þe dure to mak entre, “Cum in, cum in,” þan wald he say, As he herd oþer bid perfay. Be þis oiss þai callit him þen William Cumyn with all men. The King William of Scotland Than gaif him in till Tindall land, And gert him alsua weddit be With Donaldis dochtir fre, That in þe quenys chalmer baid, As I forouth þis mentioun maid. The Erll of Sanct Paulis sone, Quhen þis, as I ?ow tald, wes done, Weddit Bettow till his wif, That Donald gat in till his lif; And on þis Bettow eftir þat This erllis sone a dochtir gat; And syne þis erllis sone throu cass Deid befor his fader was; And sa, be custum of þat land, To þe erll at wes liffand His breþer airis were of det. Than Bettow, þat hir saw hard set, For quhy hir dochtir and scho alsua Behuffit all þe land forga, Come hame agane in to Scotland To þe King William than regnand; And in his chalmer baith þai baid, And to þe quene þare seruice maid. Vpon þis madin, þat weddit was With William Cummyn, in schort space A sone callit William Cummyn he gat; And þat sone William eftir þat Gat lauchfull oþer sonnis twa; Richart and Walter callit wer þai. Baith þai twa were mychti men; Erll of Menteith Walter wes þen. This Walter worth mychti eftir þat, And mony landis be conquest gat. Aire had he nane of his body; His eldare broþer Richart forthy Aire he maid of all his land. The thrid broþer ?it I fand, Callit Alexander Erll of Buchane; And he a sone had hecht William; And þis William had sonnis twa; Iohne and Alexander were þai. And þis Alexander eftir þat In spouss twa faire dochteris he gat: Henry þe Bewmond þe eldest Weddit, and nixt hir þe ?oungest Schire Iohne þe Ross tuke till his wif, And furþ wiþ hir he led his lif. Bot Iohne, þat wes þe eldest broþer, Erll of Bughane befor þe toþer, Off lauchfull bed had sisteris five. The Erll Patrik till his wif The eldest had; on hir he gat Patrik, þat erll wes eftir þat Off Dunbar; and in likwiss Off Stratherne þe Erll Maliss The secund sister had, and scho A sone hecht Malice had him to. The thrid Schir Robert Vmfravile, That Erll of Anguss wes þat quhile; Off Anguss and of Ryddisdaill Erll he wes of baith alhaill. On þat lady ?it eftirwart Off Vmfrawile he gat Robert; On þat lady he gat alsua Vthire breþer to Robert ma. The ferd Schir William of Brethrin Spousit, and gat Schir Davy syne. Schire Nycholl þe Foulis till his wif Weddit þe fift in till his lif, And on hir he gat sonnis twa; Schire William and Schir Iohne were þai. [T]o Richard Cumin now ga we, The eldest of þe breþer thre. The Erll Waltere, quham of befor ?e herd, gif ?e haif in memore, Off Menteith his aire him maid Off all þe landis þat he had. This Richard Iohne Reid Cummyn gat. This Iohne Reid Cummyn eftir þat, Þocht he wes of sum conditioun, He wes a knycht of gret renovne. He had twa wiffis in his live, Ilkane till oþer successive. On ane of þai þis Iohne Reid gat Iohne Blak Cummyn, þat eftir þat At Loghyndoris vpon cass This Iohne Blak Cummyn deid was. The Reid Cummyn had dochteris twa, And to þai withoutin ma. Richard Suard in till his lif The eldest of þaim tuke to wif. The secund sister tuke Gothfray, To surname callit þe Mowbray; He gat a sone wes callit William; Iohne þe nixt wes callit be name; In all Scotland wes nocht þan As þis Iohne sa faire a man; Rogere, and Phillip syne þe knycht, That prisit wes, baiþ bald and wycht; And fyft callit wes Gothfray. Eftir Bannoburne, as I herd say, In till Ingland he tuke full tyte Off þe Frere Prechouris þe habit. The thrid dochtir of Reid Cummyn Alexander of Ergyle syne Tuke, and weddit till his wif. One hir he gat in till his lif Iohne of Lorne, þe quhilk gat Evin of Lorne eftir that. The ferd dochtir oure þe laif To wif þe Lord tuke of Murraif; On hir þis Lord of Murraif gat Andro of Murraif, þat eftir that Wes at þe brig of Striueling slane, Quhen William Wallace did his pane To fend þe kinrik of Scotland, Off king quhen it wes þan vakand. Bot Iohne Blak Cummyn in his lif Tuke and weddit till his wif Iohne þe Balliollis dochtir quhile, That he gat on Derwergill. Off þat mater we sall speik sone, Quhen all þe laif to þat is done. Now to proceid in þis matere For to mak oure process clere, Quhen Alexander þe thrid wes deid, And left na sone in till his steid, Sua endit haill in his persoune Off William þe generatioun. Off Williammys broþer we mon forthy, That wes but dout þe Erll Davy, Rekyne þe generatioun As wes in to successioun. This Davy erll wes of lagh Off Huntyngdoun and Garwyagh. To King William he wes broþer; And sum men sais he wes þe toþer, Nixt Malcome þe Madin, þat wes eldest; Sa wes King William þe ?oungest. Men sayis þis Davy in Sarasynes Travalit, quhen William crovnit wes; And eftir þat, quhen he come hame, Thare kepit him þe King Williame, And, as men sais, in þe presens Off mony lordis with reuerens He perofferit him þe crovne; For he said he had mast resoune Befor him þat crovne to beire, For he knew him his eldere Broþer, and quyt him planely At of nane euill succudry, Na of nane euill presumptioun He vsurpit nocht þe crovne; Bot thocht all tyme, gif þat he Mycht him eftir with ene se, The crovne he suld haif at his will, As till him fell be law and skill. Off þis proffer þe Erll Davy Held him content and said in hy, Sen William hapnit þat rialte To haif befor him, he said þat he Wald nocht ta fra him þe crovne, Bot hald him payit of Huntyndoun, That fell till him as of lagh, And þe erldome of Gariach. This Erll Davy had dochteris thre. Mergaret þe first of thai callit he; This Margret wes a plesand may; Hir weddit Allane of Galloway. This Allane on hir eftir þat A dochtir callit Derworgill gat; To Iohne þe Ballioll scho wes wif. On þis Derworgill in his lif ?oung Iohne þe Ballioll he gat, The quhilk gat Edwart eft þat, That come in Scotland syne, And straik þe batall of Duplyne. In þis Edward endit haill Off þe Ballioll all þe maill. This Derworgill þe faire lady Had a sister callit Mariory; Iohne Cummyn tuke hir to his wif, And gat on hir in till his lif A sone, þat callit wes Iohne Cummyn, That slane wes in to Drumfreiss syne. This last Iohne Cummyn neuerþeles Had a dochtir, þat weddit was With þe Erll of Athall Davy, The quhilk gat apon hir body A sone callit Davy, and oþer ma. Bot Davy, þe eldest of þai, Schire Henry þe Bewmondis dochtir faire Weddit, becauss at scho wes aire Off all þe erldome of Bughane, That Schir Iohne Cummyn befor þan, The quhilk hir moder fader wes, It aucht, and deit syne sonles. This Erll Davy gat on þat schene Davy, þat slane wes at Kylblene. This Allane, þat lord wes of Galloway, Ane oþer dochtir had in his day, And he maryit that ilk lady With Schir Roger of Qwyncy; And þis Schir Rogere eftir þat Thre dochteris on þat lady gat; And þai dochteris wer weddit þen With thre noble mychti men. The Lord of Feres þe eldest, The Erll of Bughane þe ?ongest, The Lord þe Suthirland in till his lif The thrid lady had to wif. Thus þire thre lordis in þar liffis Tuke þire thre ladyis to þar wiffis. Alexander Cummyn he wes callit þen, That erll wes þat tyme of Bughen, The quhilk weddit þat lady, Schir Rogeris dochtir of Quyncy; To Schir Iohne Cummyn fader he wes, The quhilk, as ?e herd, deit soneles. CHAPTER CXL. Off þe Brussis genology In þis clauss it tellis clerely. The Erll Davy of Huntingdoune, That wes commendit of hie honour, Ane oþer dochtir had, suth to tell, That callit wes Dame Isabell. Robert þe Bruss in till his lif Tuke þat lady till his wif; This Robert þe Bruss eftir þat On hir a sone hecht Robert gat, And þat sone Robert eftirwart Gat a sone, wes callit Robert The Bruss, þe quhilk in till his dais Weddit of Carrik þe Countass; Sa wes he Erll and lord alhaill Off Carrik and of Annanderdaill. This Erll of Carrik, Schir Robert, Gat on þat lady eftirwart Robert þe Bruss, at wes our king, And Scotland had in gouernyng. The Erll of Carrik gat sonnys twa, And broþer till oure king were þai; And eftir þat þe thrid gat he, And þir þe names were of þai thre: Neill, Alexandere, and Eduard, That deit in Irland eftirwart. But barnis þire barnis deit ilkane, Outtane Robert oure king allane. Robert oure king had alsua Twa sisteris, and þe first of þai Wes weddit with þe Erll Gartnay, That Erll of Mare wes in his day. One hir he gat þe Erll Donald, That wes a stout man and a bald. This Donald eftir gat Thomas, That Erll of Mare syne neist him was; Thare come nane aire of his body; His sister wes his aire forthy. And þat sister weddit wes With Erll William of Dowglass. This William on þat lady gat Iames of Dowglass, þat eftir þat Gert mony of oure fais spurne, Quhare he wes slane at Ottirburne. This Iames wes vertuouss and manly, And gouernyt þe Marchis manfully. All þe floure of his ?outhheid He spendit all in to manheid. Foure ?eris Erll of Mare he was: His tyme he spendit in prowes. He by his fader in Melross lyis, His spirit in till Paradyse. Off Mare his sister wes his aire, And of þe Garioch, but dispare. Schire Malcome of Drummond till his wif Tuke and weddit hir in his lif; Barnis on hir had he nane. Quhen þis Malcome þe dede had tane, The Erll of Buchanis sone, Stewart Alexander, weddit hir eftirwart. Scho deit, and till him na barne baire; Bot he remanit Erll of Mare. He wes vertuouss in his deid, And weill reullit at he had to [leid]. The secund sister, at Robert Oure king þare had, wes eftirwart Weddit with þe Erll Schir Hew Off Ross, a lord of gret valew; And on hir he gat sonnys thre: The eldest þe erldome had all fre Off Ross, and wes callit William. He had a sister wes callit Eufame, That syne wes quene of Scotland, Quhen þat hir lord wes king regnand; Robert Stewart to name had he, And broukit all þat ryalte. This Quene Eufame in till hir lif, Quhen þat scho wes our kingis wif, Till him scho baire barnis seire; Bot of þaim all nane liffand were Bot Waltere Stewart, þat syne was Erll of Athall and of Catnes, Quhen þat þis memoriall Titillit wes Originall. This Erll William had dochteris twa: The eldest weddit wes of þai With Schir Walter of Lesly, A manfull knycht and full worthy. Schire Alexander Fresall in his lif The toþer dochtir had to wif. This Walter of Lesly had a sone; Quhen his faderis dais were done, Off Ross he ioisit þe erldome fre; But lauchfull aire syne deit he. Off þis process gif ?e will mare, ?e speire at vthire forthiremare. Robert þe Bruss oure king, quhen he Had of Carrik þe erldome fre In heretage, or he tuke þe crovne Off Scotland, or possessioun, Erll Gartnais sister, I herd tell, That hecht be name Dame Isabell, He tuke and weddit till his wif. One hir he gat in till his lif Bot a dochtir, callit Mariory. Walter Stewart þat lady Tuke to wif, and eftir þat Robert Stewart on hir he gat, That langtyme eftir that baire þe crovne Off Scotland, and possessioun. Of Eufamys birgh amangis þe laif Come Thomas, þat Erll wes of Murraif. Quhen Isabell, of Carrik þe Countass, Had endit of hir lif þe dais, Hir lord þe Bruss, at þan baid All a quhile in wedoheid, Bot eftir ?it, or he wes king, Or of his realme had gouernyng, The dochtir he weddit of Ameyre, That erll wes þan of Vllisteyre In Irland, and on hir body A sone he gat wes callit Davy, That wes his aire, and syne our king, And Scotland had in gouernyng.

Wpone hir þis erll gat A sone þat Iohne wes callit; eftir þat He ostage for his eme wes send In Ingland, for at he wes kend The King Davyis sister sone. Thare were all his dais done. Off þe toþer dochtir Mald Off me sall ?e heire na mare tald. Erll Davy had þe thrid dochtir; Henry þe Hastyngis weddit hir; Thire come na froit of þat wedding; Quhat suld be maire said of þat thing? Eftire all þire generationis, As þai rane in successionis, Off Bruss or Ballioll be ?oure sycht Quhilk were mast like to haif þe rycht? The Stewartis Originall Maister Iohne Barbour tretit haill In faire metyre, mare vertuously Than I can think in my study, Be gud continewatioun In successive generatioun. Off Murrave and of þe Dowglass, How þat þare begynnyng wes, Sen sindry men spekis syndrely, I can put it in na story. Bot in þare armes baith þai beire The sternis nocht set in lik manere; Till mony men at ?it is sene, Apperand like as þai had bene Off a kyne be descens lynyall, Or be branchis collaterall. Off Ingland come þe Lyndsay; Maire of þaim I can nocht say. CHAPTER CXLI. How Derworgill þat lady fre Did mony gud werkis of pete.

How þe Erll of Fif wes slane, And how his slaaris sufferit pane. A thousand and twa hundreth ?ere Foure score and aucht, to rekin cleire, Eftire þe blessit Natiuite, That wes þe causs of all oure gle, Schire Patrik of Abirnethy, And Schir Walter als þe Persy, Throu counsall of Schir William Off Abirnethy, quharfor gret blame He baire and for þe causs þat day, In hiddillis and in buschement lay, Waitand þe Erll of Fife Duncane, That sone wes of þe Erll [Colbane]. The wayis þai kepit sa straitly, That he mycht na way ga þaim by. At Petpollok þire knychtis twa, Schire Patrik and Schir Walter alsua, Slew þis Duncane Erll of Fife. And quhen þai fra him had red þe lif, Out of þe land þai wald haif past. Schire Andro of Murray als fast Followit with batall haill Till Colbane toune in Cliddisdaill. Thare tuke he Walter and twa squyeris, That at þat slauchter were his feris. Thai thre þare he put to deid; And Schir William, but remeid, In to þe castell of Dowglass He gert hald him quhill he dede was. Patrik for dreid of þis mischance Fled out of Scotland in to France, And thare he duelt till his ending; This vengeans followit of þat thing. CHAPTER CXLIII. How Iohne þe Bellioll beand king Ganestude King Edwardis bidding. A thousand and twa hundreth ?ere Nynty and twa, or þarby neire, Sone eftir at þis wes done, Iohne þe Ballioll wes crovnit at Scone; And þare he tuke of his barnage Fewte, seruice and homage. Bot of Robert þe Bruss he Gat noþer homage nor fewte Quhen he wes king of Scotland; He maid homage till Ingland. Quhen Duncane, þat wes Erll of Fife, As ?e haif herd, had lossit þe lif, Makduf his broþer, a squyare That lord wes of Lynquhonquhare, Baith be slycht and be powere Thai brocht þis causs in iugement Befor Balliole king in Parliament, That ordanit wes and set at Scone. Makduf persauit þat Balliole sone Contrary in his causs þan wes; Fra his court and his process This Makduff appelit forthy, And þaron held rycht stalwartly; In till his help and his defens He clamyt in till audiens The King Eduard of Ingland, Off quham þe Balliole wes haldand. Than with his appele als fast This Makduf to Lundone past, And þare proponit his quereill. That plesit to King Edward weill, Becauss þat neuer befor cass Off Scotland till him schawin was. His breif he gert speid forthy To summond þe Ballioll bodely Till appere befor him, as he That maid him homage and fewte, At his Parliament till appeire To Makduf to mak ansuere Eftir his opinionys. This Iohne þe Ballioll, wiþ gret personis Off counsall chosin, als fast To Lundone furþ his wayis past. Than on set day in plane Parliament The King Edward sat in iugement, And gert call [þe] king of Scotland, That be him self in wes sittand, As he wes summond till appeire To Makduf to mak ansuere. Iohne þe Ballioll, þan sittand, Gert at þe bar his spekare stand, And till him and to his counsall His speche he commendit haill. Than þe King Edwart of Ingland Bad him ga to þe bare and stand, And þare his speche on þame to lay, Quhat euer him likit for to say; For it wes na law of þat land Procuratouris to mak sittand. Than Iohne þe Balliole als fast To þe bare at his bidding past, And commendit in þat steid Till his counsall all his pleid. Quheþer it wes for luf or feid, I can nocht tell ?ow, bot þis done To Scotland went þe Ballioll sone; And þare him menyt at he was Nocht tretit as king in process. Than ordanit he a Parliament sone At schort day to be haldin in Scone. Thare þe estatis assemblit haill, And gaif him þan for full counsaill That, be sum gret man wiss and lele, Baith be letter, word, and seill, Off fewte to gif vp þe band, That þe Ballioll king of Scotland Had maid to þe King Edwart, And all allegians eftirwart, Homage, or in vthire seruice, That he had maid on ony wiss To þe King Edward of Ingland; And did him als till vnderstand At he agane rycht and ressoune Gat it be fraude and extorsioun. The Abbot of Abyrbrothou þan, Dene Henry callit, a cunnand man, Off counsall he wes chosin þare, Off þis charge to be þe berare. For he wes trowit of gret arghnes, With mony he lakkit þan wes; This message þai gert him tak forthy, And furth he past hastely Vpone coundit within schort space. Quhen he to Lundone cummyn was, Thare to þe king in his presens Off his gret counsall wiþ reuerens His charge he deliuerit þare. The king þan maid him þis answare: “Now may ?e se at a fule sone Heire a foly deid has done.” Thus he said in Franche leid, Of þe Balliole he menyt in deid: “Cum till ws gif he na will, But dout, we sall cum him till.” To þis abbot wes messingere, The king him maid þan bot dry chere; For nouþer to meit na mangery Callit he þis abbot Dene Henry. Set he wes lakkit of lourdnes, His message did he neuerþeles; And, for his condit wes neire gane, Langare condit he had nane; Bot, fra he had his message done, To Scotland hame he hyit him sone; For he wes ferde, and ay in dout, Or his condyt suld weire out. With þe lang schankis þis King Edwart To þe Marche come eftirwart, Within þe bordouris of Ingland. Iohne þe Balliole of Scotland He gert call rycht þare, as king, To cum, and hald his oblising. Bot þis Balliole on na manere Wald nocht till his call appeire. Neuerþeles þis King Edward Gert call him ofttymes eftirward, To cum and do for his fewte, As he wes oblist till him, said he. Bot Iohne þe Ballioll on na wiss Wald mak him fewte na seruice, Na at his call wald neuer appeire, Na bow till him on na manere. Sa at þe last, for his offens, This King Edward gert gif sentens And dome of his pertinacioun, And for his hie rebellioun, And demyt him deprivit to be Off all honour and dignite, And of all manere of oþer thing That efferit vnto a king. Than þis ilk King Edwart Maid fleching to þe Bruss Robert That he forsuth had gret consciens Off þe wickit wrang sentens That he had gevin agane his rycht; Forthy, he said, with all his mycht He suld him rycht and suppowell To þe kinrik foroutin faill, And recouer it till his hand Throu strenth and mycht till he mycht stand, And on þe Balliole to mufe weire With all his help and his powere. Robert þe Bruss þan trowit weill All þat he hecht him ilk deill; And till his freyndis hame wrait he That king of Scotland he thocht to be, For þe King Edward in his rycht Had hecht to help him in all his mycht. Bot þis King Edward all wiþ gawdis Knakit Robert þe Bruss with frawdis, And did bot chullit him with gile, As a wickit man with wile, As ?e sall heire eftir þis sone, Quhen all þe laif þarto is done. CHAPTER CXLIV. How King Edward in Berwik tovne On Gud Friday slew Scottis dovne. A thousand and twa hunder ?ere And sex and nynty þarto cleire, Fra þe tyme þat þis wes done, Iohne þe Balliole alsa sone Gert summond all, baith pure and rike, And þe estatis of þe kinrik. For in Fife þat tyme wes nane Erll, baroune, na ?it chiftane, The frehaldaris of þat land, Quhare mast perellis were apperand, For þar wit and þare prowes Off þe estatis chosin wes; And of þare biddyng als fast Thire gentillis of Fife to Berwik past. Thare a gret navyne þan thai fand Off five havinnis of Ingland, Stuffit weill wiþ meit and men, That fast þe toune assal?eit then. Thre hundreth speris of Fife, or ma, Thare fais in fecht þai cunraid sa That mony þai gert drovnyt be, And þe laif þai gert tak þe se, Off forss hame agane fleand To þare avne havinnis of Ingland, And xviii. gret schippis þai wan. Off þame þai savit neuer a man; For quhy þai trowit sone of weire To be assegeit with gret powere, And presoneris in þe meyne quhile To keip þaim thocht wes gret perile. Forthy þaim thocht mare honeste Vn?oldin to sla þame in melle Than sic ane hirsell for till hald, And bargane byde, or batall bald. Forthy of counsall and vertew Sic dout and perill till eschew, All þai soldiouris þai slew doune, And stuffit with þar gudis þe toune; And all þare schippis in a fyre Thai brint rycht þan in colis schyre. And quhen King Edward of Ingland Herd of þis deid sicker tythand, All bryme he bolnyt in till breth, Wrythand all in wedand wreth, In hy assemblit all his oste, And come till Berwik with gret bost, And set a segis sone to þe tovne, And maid gret sawtis and felloune; And þai within maid resistens Aganis him, and gret defens. And quhen he saw at he mycht nocht Wyn þe tovne lichtly, as he thocht, He thocht in his ententioun With fals dissymylatioun As he wald cess of all þat weire; And gert remufe all his powere, And laid þaim in buschementis neire by, In woddis and hiddillis prevely, Oure dryvand sa thre dais or ma. And till at he wes bydand sa, He gert fen?e armes of Scotland, Off lordis as þai were berand, And gert paynt baneris and pennonys Off Scottis lordis of renovnis; And þai, within þe toune þat wes, Reiosyt of þis sycht, but less; For quhy þai wist nor herd rycht nocht Off þis desait aganis þaim wrocht. All þe ?ettis þai vpkest, To lat þaim entir as þai lest. And it wes airely in þe mornyng, Or þe sone raiss, befor þe dayspring; And at þai opin ?ettis þen Rycht fast thrang in þe Inglismen, And vmbeset þe Scottismen þare, Or euer þai wist weill quhat þai were. And þare þe Inglismen slew doune All þe Scottis folkis in þe tovne, Off all conditioun, nane sparand, That þai within þe tovne þan fand, Als wele lerit as seculare; Thare wes na persone þai wald spaire Off nane estait na of nane age; Thai sparit noþer man nor page, Noþer auld na ?oung, madinis na wiffis, Bot all þai gert þare loss þar liffis. Thus were þai slaand þare sa fast All þe day oure, quhill at þe last The King Eduard saw at þat tyde A woman slane, and of hir syde A barne he saw fall out sprewland, Beside þe moder slane lyand. “Lacess! lacess!” þan cryit he; “Leif of! leif of!” þat word suld be. And of þis slauchter mare to speke, As I herd say, Antone þe Beke, That þan wes bischop of Durhame, A cruell man and of felloune fame, Enterit in þare with þe formast; And sa furth throu þe toune he past, With his hand saynand for dispite, And biddand þaim fast sla and smyte The Scottis doune, and nane to spaire. He mycht be callit a clerk and maire; He wes a bischop of þe deuill, That wes sa reddy to gere do euill. Forthy with him he has his [meid], For all þai bodyis þat he gert bleid Deit for þe defens of þare kinrik, And are in bliss, as weill is like. Sevin thousand and five hunder þare Bodyis reknyt, at slane ware; This wes done on þe Gud Friday. For God, na prayere, nane sparit þai. Twa dais eftir þat a deip flude Throu all þe tovne ran of þar blude; And þus þat king of Ingland, Nocht king, bot a cursit tyrand, Did þat day his deuotioun. He gert þare thole þe passioun Off dede mony gud creature, In till full graciouss and pure, Clene schrevin, in gud entent, Redy to tak þare sacrament. His office wes þat Gud Friday To heire þai innocentis de, and say “Allace! allace! now, Lord, we cry For him, þat deit þis day, mercy.” Nane oþer seruice þat day herd he, Bot gert sla on without pete. The saullis of þaim he gert sla þare [He] send quhare his saull neuermare Wes like to cum, þat is to bliss, As be his ending wes sene, I wiss. Quhasa likis he may it luke, How he endit, in King Robertis buke. That samyn ?ere all Inglismen That in Scotland were wonnand then, Quheþer he ware vicare or persoune, Be sentens of depriuatioun Out throu all þe haill kinrik Ilk bischop in his bischoprike All þare rentis tuke þaim fra, And Scottismen avansit wiþ þai. Off all conditioun and of age, Baith auld and ?oung, man and page, Be deliuerance of counsall Than out of Scotland wes put haill. That ilk ?ere als in Dunbare Mony slane in batall ware: Schire Patrik þe Grahame, a noble knycht, Stout and manly, bald and wycht; With mony vthire gentilmen Thare were slane, and woundit þen. The Erll of Ross þare Schir William, A lord commendit of gret fame, Sexty knychtis to þai and ten, And squyaris mony, manly men, And mony oþer faire personis, Famouss lordis and baronis, Fled to þe castell out of þat stoure, Lypnand þare till haue had succour. Bot Richard of Sward, at wes þan Off þat castell capitane, Resauit þame rycht glaidsumly, And syne gert bynd þame sickerly; And, bunding as scheip, in Ingland He send þaim sa in to presand Till King Eduard with þe langschankis, That ?ald him þarfor mony thankis. This tyme wes gret descensioun In Scotland, and diuisioun; For þe kinrik wes in twa Devidit, and in weire alsua. The Cummynis kyne fauorit þe part Off þe Balliole, and þe Bruss Robert A bischop fauorit and erllis twa, Of Glasgow, Athaill and Mare were þai; All thire thre in gret sekirnes Till Robert þe Bruss bunding wes, And maist þe bischop of Glasgow Robert, a lord of gret vertew. The Cummynis and oþer lordis forthy Had þire lordis at gret invy, And athire part wes vtheris fa. Thus wes þe realme devidit in twa. Throu þis deuysioun innocentis Tholit gret panys and tormentis. And eftir at þe Scottismen ware, As ?e herd, vencust at Dunbare, To þe langschankis þis Edwart In specialte come þe Bruss Robert, And prayit him, gif it were his will, That he had hecht him to fulfill; That wes þe kinrik of Scotland, At wes þat tyme of king vacand. One Franche þis Eduard maid ansuere To Robert þe Bruss on þis manere: “Ne auons wen awtres chous efferis que ie a wous realme ganere?” Thire wordis in Inglis is to say, That he in Franche said perfay: “Haue we nocht ellis to do now Bot wyn a kinrik to gif ?ow?” Robert þe Bruss kend weill þan The falset of þat wickit man, And till his land als fast In Ingland his way he past; In Scotland he na byding maid, Bot till his avne in Ingland raid. With þe langschankis þis Edwart Throu Lowthiane past eftirwart. Thre gret castellis of Scotland ?oldin he tuke in his hand, Dunbare, Edinburgh and Striuelyne. Iohne þe Balliole he followit syne Rycht to þe castell of Forfare. Iohne þe Cummyn met him þare, That of Strabogy lord wes þan; Thare he become þis Edwartis man. Till Aberdene þan als fast Fra þin with his oste he past. Thare Iohne þe Ballioll wiþ slycht and forss He tuke, and brocht him to Munross; And in þe castell of þat tovne, That þan wes famouss of renovne, This Iohne þe Ballioll spul?eit he Off all his robis of ryalte, And tuke out þe pelloure of his tabart, Twme Tabart þai callit him eftirwart; And [all] vthire insignyis That fell to king on ony wiss, As crovne and cepture, suerd and ring, Fra þis Iohne, þat he maid king, He tuke halely fra him þare, And maid him of þe kinrik baire. And þare þis Iohne tuke a quhit wand, And gaif vp in þis Edwartis hand Off þe kinrik all þe rycht That he had þan, or ?it haif mycht, Fra him and all his airis þare, Thare eftir to clame it neuermare. Be schip þan þis ilk Iohne, And his sone Edward onone, He send to Lundone, and þare he Gert þame straitly kepit be. Off Iohne þe Balliolis deliuerance He maid, and tholit him pass in France. Bot he gert his sone Edwart Be kepit langtyme eftirwart; And gert him be suorne bodely Be þe gret aith sickerly, That he suld neuer clame na rycht Scotland to bruke, albeid he mycht. ?it neuerþeles in Scotland syne He come of weire, and straik Duplyne. Sone eftir at þis wes done, This King Edward withoutin hone, As he hame throu þe land raid, Off þe cummynis mony him maid Homage and faith of fewte, For raddour ?it it behuffit sa be. Out of þe land quhen he wes past, The staitis of Scotland als fast At Scone togidder assemblit haill, To be þare for þare gouernall. Twelf lordis þare þai chesit of mycht To succour þe realme and þare rycht, [That] bunding were be faithfull band To fend þe fredome of Scotland. Than þare castellis and þare tovnis Thai stuffit wele wiþ lele personis. Schire Iohne þe Cummyn, þat wes þan Erll and lord of all Bughane, A gret ost gaderit þan als fast, And in þe north of Ingland past In to dispite of þat tyrand, That king him callit of Ingland. With fyre and wappinis he distroyit All at he ourtuke, and noyit. To Carlele sa he raid of weire, And it assegit with his powere; Bot neuerþeles ?it, as he thocht, The toune at þat tyme wan he nocht. CHAPTER CXLV. How William Wallace gouernyt Scotland Till it of king wes vakand. Twelf hundreth nynty ?eris and sevin Fra Crist wes borne þe King of Hevin, William Wallace in Clydisdaill, That saw his kyne supprisit haill With Inglismen in gret dispite, Thare harmys sone he thocht to quyte. In sempill stait þocht he wes þen, ?it wes he cummyn of gentill men; His fader wes a manly knycht, And his moder a lady brycht, And he gottin in mariage. His eldare broþer þe heretage Had, and ioisit in his dais. This ilk gud William Wallas Drew to wappinnis and to geire, As manly man vsis in weire. With a suerd baith large and lang He vsit oftsyss for to gang, A mantill wappit him about; Off stature he wes strang and stout; And gret dispite þe Inglismen Had at þis William Wallace then. And sa it happinnit on a day In Lanark toune, as I herd say, First þai maid him argument Off his lang suerd as he went. Ane a tyt maid at his suerd: “Hald still þi hand, and speik þi word.” “With þi swerd þov mais gret bost.” “Tharfor þi dame maid litill coste.” “Quhat causs has þov to weire grene?” “Na causs, bot for to mak þe teyne.” “Thow suld nocht beire sa lang a knyf.” “Sa said þe preist at swyffit þi wif. Sa lang he vsit to þi repaire, Till at his barne wes maid þin aire.” “Me think þov driffis me to scorne.” “Thy dame wes swyffit or þov wes borne.” Fra þis þai warpit na ma wordis; Bot swith wes drawin mony suerdis In to þe mercat of Lanark, Quhare Inglismen were styth and stark, And faucht sa fast in gret multitud Agane þis William Wallace gud, That gaif þaim þare mony derf dynt; Thare wes na armour his straik mycht stynt. As he wes in þat stoure fechtand, Fra ane he smat of þe rycht hand; And fra þat man mycht do na mare, The left hand held fast þe buklare, And with þe stomp, as he were wod, He swappit egirly þe blude Rycht in till William Wallace face. Maire vincust of þat blude he was Than he wes of þat stalwart stoure Off all his fais dingand on doure. The Inglis folkis assemblit sa fast One William Wallace quhill at þe last, Fra he had hurt of þame feill þare That þan aganis him fechtand ware, Till his innys, as him behuffit, Warely him werand he remuffit. He him defendit manlely, And þai him followit fellonly. In to þat toune wes his lemman, That wes a plesand faire woman; Scho saw hir lemman pressit sa, Wit ?e weill, þan wes scho wa. Scho gat him in within þe dure; Thai bruschit it vp in to þe flure. Bot scho had gottin him prevely Out at a narow way neireby; And with hire wordis scho taryit þaim þan, Till he fra þaim to þe wod wan. Forthy þe schiref of þat land, That wes King Eduardis luftennand, Come to Lanarke, and þare he Gert þis woman takin be, And gert hir þare be put to deid. That Wallace saw weill in þat steid, In hiddillis quhare he stude neire by, That for hir wes in hert sary. Than till his freyndis als fast In to þe cuntre Wallace past, And xxx. men he gat or ma. And þat ilk nycht he come with þai, That were waill wycht men and stark, All prevely within Lanark; And quhare he wist weill þe schiraif Wsit his innys þare till haif, In till a loft, quhare þat he lay, Eftyre mydnycht lang forouth day, Wp he bruschit þat burdin dure, And laid it flatlingis on þe flure. With þat þe schiref all agast, “Quha is þare?” he askit fast. Wallace ansuerd him in hy: “I, Wallace, þat þov besely Has socht with mastry me to sla. Now has þov met heire with þi fa; The womanis deid of ?isterday I sall þe quyte now, gif I may.” With þire wordis eftir þat The schiref be þe throt he gat, And þat hie staire he harlit him doune, And slew him þare within þe toune. And fra he þus þe schiref slew, The Scottismen fast till him drew, That with þe Inglismen oft ware Greiffit, and supprisit saire; And William Wallace þai maid þare Thare chiftane to þaim and ledare, For þai saw he durst tak on hand Agane þare innemeis to stand. He wes stout and liberall, And wyse and happy in gouernall. To sla he sparit nocht Inglismen, That wald haif done him þat ilk þen. The gretest lordis of oure land Till him gert he be bowand; And till his bidding quha were nocht bovne He tuke, and put þaim in presoune. Off castellis, burrowis, and of tovnis All gert he cum at his summondis. The Inglismen out of oure land He put with strenth and stalwart hand. Sa of Wallace þis William Sic renovne raiss and sic fame That to King Eduard of Ingland Off his dedis come tythand. At for he wes occupiit at hame, He send Schir Hew of Kersynghame, At þat tyme wes his thesaurare, In Scotland with a gret poware. This William Wallace at Dunde Assegiand þat castell wes, quhen he Herd at þare come a gret oste Out of Ingland all with boste With Schir Hew of Kersinghame. Than þis Wallace gud William Bad þe burgess of Dunde, A pane of lif and gudis fre, That þai at þat sege suld ly, And keip þat castell stalwartly, Till it were wonnyng or ?oldin þen, And till his dangere bring þai men. And with his oste þan als fast To Striueling William Wallace past; And at þe Brig of Forth be name Wallace met with Kersinghame; And þare þai mellit in to fecht, Quhare mony doure to deid wes dicht. Thare þai dang on alsa fast Till Kersynghame wes at þe last Wincust with mast part of his men, That slane besyde þe brig wes þen; And þe remanand fra þat steid Turnyt all þe bak and fled, And Scottis followit fast on þen. Quhare euer þai ouretuke Inglismen, Thai sparit nane, bot slew all doune. Wallace for þis had hie renovne; For throu him haill þe victory The Scottis had of þat iuperdy; And few wes slane of Scottismen. Bot Andro of Murray slane wes þen; Fadere to Schir Andro wes he, And prisit of rycht get bounte. This deid did Wallace at Striuelyne, And hely wes commendit syne. Fra he had vencust Kersynghame, Hieare and hieare ay wox his name; And throu þe kinrik as he past The Scottis till him inclynit fast, And syne fra þe Alhallomess In Ingland till ?ule he bydand wes. All Annandirdaill as men of weire That tyme brynt with his powere, And with prayis out of þat land Come eftir þe ?ule into Scotland. CHAPTER CXLVI. Off William Fresale þe bischopis dede, And of Lammyrtoun in his steid. In till France þat ilk ?ere The bischap callit William Fresere Off Sanctandrois [deid, and] lyis In þe Frere Prechouris of Pariss. Bot his hert first ordanit he Brocht in Scotland for to be; And rycht sua wes it with honour, And laid in hallowit sepulture. In Sanct Androis cathedrall Kirk þare all conventall Channons, togidder gaderit all, Laid þat hert within þe wall, Quhare now þare standis towmys twa, Off Gamyle and Lammyrtoun were þai. Thare William Fresaris hert is laid Betuix þe twa towmys forsaid. Quhen William Fresale þus wes deid, Than chosin bischop in his steid Wes Maister William of Lammyrtoun, A clerk commendit of renovne, A worthy prelate of vertew, And chancellare þat tyme of Glasgow. CHAPTER CXLVII. Off þe batall of þe Fawkirk, That wes to Scottismen full irk. Twelf hundreth viii. and nynty ?ere Eftire þe birth of oure Lord deire, William Wallace in Scotland Wes þe statis haill sterand, And commendit wes rycht weill Off his gouernance ilk deill. And quhen with langschankis þis Edward Had herd in Ingland eftirwart How in Scotland þis William Wallace had met wiþ Kersinghame, And had him and all his men slane, Off þai tythingis he wes nocht fayne. He gaderit þan a gret powere, And in Scotland he come of weire; And on Sanct Mary Magdalenys day At þe Fawkirk assemblit þai. Thare William Wallace tuke on hand, With mony gret lordis of Scotland, To sembill with þis king in fecht, Quhare mony doure to dede were dycht. This King Edward had with him then Off Scotland mony gentilmen, That for dispite and for invy Drew till him maliciously; And þe Cummynis in þai dais Luffit nocht William Wallas. Bot ?it þe lele trew Scottismen, That with Wallace were fechtand þen, Stude togidder certanely, Defendand þame full manlely, Sa þat nane þare thrill þaim mycht; Bot Robert þe Bruss þan wiþ a slycht, That þare wes þan with King Edward, Set he oure king wes eftirwart, With Antone þe Beik, a wickit man, And wyly bischop of Durehame þan, About a hill a preve way Out of þe stoure þai stall þat day, And come behind þe Scottismenis bak, And slew, and hewit, and maid fell hak, And maid alhaill discomfitoure Off þe Scottis men in þat stoure. Thare Iohne Stewart apon fut, And with him þe Brandanis of But, And mony gentillis als of Fife With Makduf, þare lossit þe lif. [Thar] for dispite and gret invy The Cummynis first all halely First left þe feild, and, as behuffit, Syne William Wallace him remuffit; Fra he persauit þar gret maliss Agane him scharpit on þat wiss. And quhen þe Scottismen fled þar way, And pressit fast till eschaip þat day, Quhare euer þai happinnit to be ouretane, Thai were slane doune euerilkane. The Inglis þare had halely Off þat iurnay þe victory. And forouth þan couþ na man say, Na neuer wes sene befor þat day, Sa haly vincust þe Scottismen; Na ?it it had nocht happinnit þen, Had nocht bene falset and invy That devit þaim þare hely. Eftire þat fecht within few dais, This ilk gud William Wallas Persauit how he hatit was With þe Cummyngis and þare purchas; And, be sic signys as he had, In gret dout of tressoune stad, Be?ond þe wattir of Forth he Forsuke þan wardane for to be, Or ?it þat stait mare to vphald; Tak þe cure þare quha sa wald. For him had levire to lif simpilly, Na vndir sic dout in sen?eory; And þe leill commonis of þe land He wald nocht periss vndir his hand. Forthy he past his way in France, And left þaim with all gouernance; Bot quhill he wes out of þe land, All mysfure in to þare hand, Till þai send for him agane, And gat him hame with mekle pane. Off his gud deidis and his manheid Gret gestis and sangis ar maid; Bot ?it sa mony, I trow nocht, As he in his dais wrocht. Quha his worschip all wald write, He suld a mekle buke endite; And all his deidis to write in heire Thareto I want wit and laysere. And eftir at all þis wes done, ?oung Iohne Cumin, Iohne Cummynis sone, Tuke þe keping of Scotland, And held þat stait in till his hand Till eftir þe batall of Roslyne; And þan þis ?oungare Iohne Cummyn Come to þe king of Inglandis pess. Bot ay till at he wardane was, Iohne þe Soullis wes with him haill Baith in help and in counsaill. CHAPTER CXLVIII. How King Edward þat tyrand Plen?eit to þe pape of Scotland. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere Eftire þe birth of our Lord deire, Phillip, þat þan wes king of France, Fra he herd tell of þat distance That wes [betwene] þe realmes twa, Scotland and Ingland baith were þai, A clerk and a knycht he send, That were of wit and manheid kend, To þe King Edward of Ingland, With gret instance him prayand To grant to trewis þat he wald, And trewly till a terme þaim hald, To þe commonis of Scotland, Sen þare realme wes þan vacand. The king of Ingland, at þe instance Off þis noble king of France, Thai trewis grantit, þat is to say, Fra þe Alhallowess till Witsonday, Wndir þis protestatioun, That for þe consideratioun That wes betuix þai realmes twa, France and Scotland baith were þai, To grant þai trewis wes nocht his will; Bot þat he grantit þai trewis till The king of France, for þat he Wes cousing till him in neire degre, And speciall freynd, and gud nychtboure, And amicable compositour; To þe said terme he grantit forthy To gere keip þaim halely. Iohne þe Sowllis þat ilk ?ere, With Iohne Cumin fallow in feire, As a wardane of Scotland, His fallow nocht þarof wittand, Throu þe counsall of gret personis, Bischopis, erllis, and baronis, Off þe estatis of Scotland, For to send message tuke on hand To þe auchtand Bonyface, That pape of Rome þat tyme was. Maister William he wes ane, Archdene þan of Louthiane, Baldrede Beset, and William To surname hattyne Heglygeame; Thire thre were gret clerkis þen, And commendit for waill wyss men. Forthy chargeit þan were þai, And fully instruct to say To þe paip, to gere him knaw The hurtis, þe greiffis for to schaw, How þe King Edward of Ingland Aganis all rycht werrayit Scotland; And how þe commonis of þat realme ware Be þat tyrand agreiffit saire, Haiffand for him na ressoune, Bot wilfull wranguiss presumptioun; And to pray þis paip Bonyface That he wald witschaif of his grace, And of his haly faderheid, Off þai iniuris to set remeid. Thire messingeris be instructioun Had þis in þare commissioun. The king of Ingland, þis Edwart, Be þis pape summond eftirwart Befor him for till appeire, To þare complayntis to mak ansueire, This king þan fen?eit evidentis, For to declare his consciens, Signyfyit þan to þe pape sone Quhat he in Scotland gert be done In his awne rycht, and na offens, And þat he tuke on his consciens; At to þat realme he had mare rycht Than he with strength recouer mycht. Than Maister Baldred and Beset, Aganis all ressonis he couþ set, Ansuerd to þaim wonder weill, And distroyit þame ilk deill Be euidentis þat he þare schawit, And maid þat tyrandis taill full lawit. And of þis mater sumtyme was Maid ane autentik gret process, And, quhasa likis of it to wit, To þe Registere I him remyt. With þe langschankis þis Edward Off stanis and vthire mater hard At Linlithqw eftir gert mak a peill, (And in King Robertis buke rycht weill It tellis eftir how it wes wone, And castin doune baith all and sum,) A thousand thre hundreth ?eris and ane Eftir þat Crist had mankynd tane. CHAPTER CXLIX. Off þe batall of Roslyne, And how þe Inglismen þare couþ tyne. A thousand and thre hunder ?ere And twa to þai to rekin cleire, Eftir þe batall, as ?e herd say, Done apon þe Magdalene day At þe Fawkirk, quhare Inglismen All þe victory had þen, The king of Ingland come be north In proper persone þe wattir of Forth, And throu his powere fra Fyffysnes All þe cuntre distroyit wes Be slauchter and distructioun, Till it come to Sanct Iohnestoun. With gret hereschip at þe last This tyrand hame in Ingland past; And þat, I trow, wes Goddis will; For till þat he wes bydand still, Fra he had vndone Balliole king, Quhare þat euer he maid byding Within oure land, he did gret scaith, Off slauchter and of hereschip baith; And maid him oure all lord and syre, And gert all bow till his empyre. And quha till him wald nocht do sa, Outhire he gert his men þaim sla, Or he þame heryit, sparand nane, Levand behind him bot wattir and stane. Bot Goddis grace and pete syne, That of all caris is medicyne, Till his purposs maid gret let. For on vthire curis his hert he set, Sa þat he mycht nocht all his will, As he etlit, þat tyme fulfill, That wes till haue subiectioun Oure our realme on till his crovne; Till haue it in to properte In his entent þat first thocht he. Quha castis his thocht to sindrynes, In ilk thing it is þe less. Off Ingland þis king forthy For gret erandis and hasty Sped him sone out of our land. And, as he hamewartis wes passand, Vpon south half þe Scottis Se All maid him aith of fewte; Baith þe schireffis of þe land, And þai þat castellis were kepand Be south half Forth all generaly, Obeyit till his sen?eory. ?it sum withdrew þaim in exile, That wald nocht obey him þat quhile; And mony vthire Scottismen Withdrew þaim to woddis þen. Young Iohne Cumin, þat wes þan Off Scotland chosin a wardane, And Symond Fresale, a gud knycht, Stout and manly, bald and wycht, Fra þis tyrand hame wes past, His suorne men þai distrublit fast, As schireffis, bal?eis, and keparis Off castellis, and oþer officiaris, That were þe king of Inglandis men; Gretly þai disesit þaim þen. For þis Iohne Cumin and Fresale Did þaim scaith and harmys fell, And cessit noþer day nor nycht To disess þaim at þar mycht, Haldand þaron full foure ?ere, As vre of weire maid þaim to steyre, Baith be slauchter and hereschip þen That ay at vndir were Inglismen. And quhen þis tyrand King Edward Herd of thire tythingis eftirwart, He send in Scotland his tresorere, Callit be name Schir Rauf Caunfeire, A manly man, and wiss and wycht, And commendit of gret forsycht, And with him xxx. thousand men Horssit weill and armyt þen, And gaif him bidding to tak vengeance Off þaim þat maid þat distrublance Off þaim þat wes his suorne men, [That] wonnand were in Scotland þen, He bad sla all doune, and nane spaire, That brekaris of his pess þan ware, And seik þaim baith in holme and hicht, And sla þaim all doune, gif þai mycht, Foroutin mercy and ransoun; And þai suld haif þar warysoun. Thire Inglismen þan held on fast, Quhill þai to Roslyne at þe last Come, and þare þai lichtit doune, And styntit tent and pal?eoune, And ordanit in to batallis thre Thare ost to departit be. Iohne Cumin and Symond then Assemblit sone oure Scottismen, That were bot vii. thousand, but ma, And with oure men assemblit sa The space of a nycht fra Bygare Thai raid to Roslyne, and fand þare Off Inglismen a gret batall Bowne to defend or till assaill. Than with þaim þare þe Scottismen Fersly faucht, and laid on then With mony doure dyntis and keyne, Till feill lay gaspand on þe grene. Oure Scottismen þaim arrayit sa That þai gert þaim þe bak all ta; And presoneris þai tuke mony, And partit amang þaim halely Armouris, wappinnis, and oþer geire, That wes wonnyng in þat weire; And wend at þai had bene all quyte Off ma batallis. Bot eftir tyte, Or þai had partit þis and done, Ane oþer batall come on þaim sone Off Inglismen all redy boune. Forthy þire presoneris þai slew doune; For, as it stude, sa þaim behuffit; And to þaim stoutly þan þai muffit. Thare þai dang on dusche for dusche, With mony rap and mony rusche; On basnettis burnist all brycht Men mycht se seire wappinnis licht; Mony suerd and mony speire In pecis brokin lyand were, And mony a semely persoune Off Inglismen were slane doune. And, for to reherss ?ow schortly, Oure Scottismen had þe victory, And tuk þare mony presonere. Bot quhill þai þusgatis partand were The geire, and wend þai had bene quyte Off all þare fais discomfite, The thrid batall þan sone saw þai Cumand on þaim in gud array, For to fecht all redy bovne, Thinkand to sla our men all doune. Oure Scottismen were þan agast, For þai had fochtin befor sa fast That sum were woundit, and sum slane, And sum had bled baith blude and brayne, And sum were wery for travaling, And sum hungerit for lang fasting, And wery were and tyrit þare, And sum granand with woundis saire. Na wonder wes þocht þai were mad; For, in þat steid quhare þai were stad, Thai saw of multitude fer ma Than ony of þe toþer twa Cumand on þaim in stout array, And pressand to be at assay. And þan Iohne Cumin sone on ane, That of þe Scottismen wes wardane, And gud Schir Symond Fresale, Comfort þar men as I sall tell. Thire twa chiftanis befor þat stoure Summond our men, as frere prechoure, For to be worthy, bald and wicht; And þus þai spak to þaim on hicht: “Lordingis, masteris, and fallowis, now With stalwart hand ilkane of ?ow Stand agane þis ane assay; Gif God will, ouris salbe þis day. In God alhaill ?our hope ?e set, Sanct Andro, Sancte Ninian, and Sanct Margret; And alsua for ?our lemmanis luf A poynt ?it in þis press ?e prufe. Na better hap haif may we Na for our rycht to lif or dee, And it is fere mare honeste To stand agane our fais þan fle, And we seand vthiris visage; And ?it haif we heire awantage. For on oure awne ground for our rycht We may baldly byde and fecht; And foullare deid may na man tak Than to be slane in to þe bak. Oure elderis, quhill þai liffand were, Wan þaim worschip our all quhare; And ?e sall weill trow all and ken That we are cummyn of gentilmen. The sempillest now our oste within Has gert gentillis in his kyn; And or we suld be in thrillage, ?it better de for oure heretage. Oure elderis ware of ald lynnage, Lordis of fee and heretage, That thocht na thing maire vgsum Than for to lif in to thrildome.” Quhat wes þar mare? þe Scottismen Off þire wordis were comfort then. The Inglismen fast to þaim drew. The Scottis men þare presoneris slew, And with þare armouris þai armyt þen Thare pure and vnarmyt ?emen. Than þe thrid tyme of þat day The Scottismen in gud array Togidder knyt þaim sarrely, And tuke þe feild full apertly; Syne semblit with þar fais in fecht, That come on þaim with all þar mycht. Thare þai dang on dynt for dynt; Thai myssit seildin quhare þai mynt. Thai laid and dang on dusche for dusche, With mony a rap and mony a rusche. The Scottismen baire þaim sa in þe feild That few askit, “Will þov þe ?eild?” Thai had na thocht presoneris to ta. Sa fersly were þai fechtand sa That þe Inglis baronis slane were doune, That had thare banere or pennone; And quhen þe small folkis saw þat sicht, Thai tuke all hert to tak þe flycht. The Scottismen sa wery was That few of þaim followit þe chass, Bot baid stane still in to þe feild, And to God gret thanking þai ?eild At þai sa sone þat a day thriss In playne fecht vencust þar innemyss. Throu hie manheid and gret bounte Discomfit þai gret batallis thre. I trow þare wes na man liffand, That euer couþ tell in ony land, Or euer herd, or saw befor, A maire commendable memore, As þai did of þis pure kinrik, In þat batall bodin vnlike. For in sum cornikillis writtin I fand That þare wes xxx. full thousand That come in Scotland with Counfeire, The king of Inglandis thesaurere, And bot vii. thousand Scottismen That assemblit agane þaim þen. Sua triblit or contriblit were þai Agane our Scottismen þat day. Armouris and gudis, þat were left In to þe feild, þai tuke vp eft All at laisere, and oþer pelf, And departit amangis þar self, And to þar awne syne maid þaim bovne With worschip, honour and renovne. CHAPTER CL. How King Edward of Ingland Had in his tyme all Scotland. Off þis deid come sone tythand Till Edward king of Ingland. And quhen he herd his men slane sa, Wes neuer wif in warld mare wa. He wantit na mare bot a schout For till haif maid him brayne wod out. All haill his oste assemblit he To hald on, baith be land and se, In to þe kinrik of Scotland, In outtragiouss fellony thinkand Wengeance on þaim all to ta, That befor his men gert sla. One þat purposs throu oure land As with his oste he wes passand, All he tuke vp till his pess; For few agane him standand wes. Castell baith and wallit toune, He tuke all in possessioune, And stuffit þaim with Inglismen. Schirreffis and bal?eis maid he þen, And alkin oþer officieris, That for to gouerne land efferis, All he maid of Inglismen, That hawtand and welans were þen To pure or riche of our kinrik, That couth do na thing mycht þaim like. Syne our þe Month þat tyrand past To Loghindoris als fast; Thare soiornand a quhile he baid, Till he þe North all wonnyng had. Fra þin southwartis he come syne, And baid all winter in Dunfermlyne. Edward his sone of Carnaverane In Sanct Iohnestoun soiornyt þan. In Scotland ?it þan men mycht se Off alkin wittale gret plente: The gallone of wyne for commone price Past nocht þat tyme foure pennyis. For a pynt now we mon pay Alsmekle neire ilk day. And eftir þe Purificatioun Fra Dunfermelyne he maid him bovne, And at Sanct Androis þan baid he, And held his Lenterne in ryalte. And þare he held his Parliament; For he thocht haill in his entent That þe kinrik of Scotland Suld all tyme be with him durand, Till him and his in successioun, As he wes in possessioun. All þe southland had he seyne, To sauf þe castell of Striuelyne. CHAPTER CLI. How King Edward gat Striuelyne, And how he presonyt þe capitane syne. A thousand thre hunder ?ere and foure Fra he his Lenterne þus held oure, Fra Sanctandrois he past syne, And set his [sege] about Striuelyne. Thare baith þe castell and þe tovne Wes ?oldin him, on condicioun That all þe men þarin suld be Off all harmes quyte and fre; In scripture þis wes writtin þare And selit; þarto þat wes mare, To þis he gert set his seill; Bot in þat hecht he wes nocht lele. For fra he had þe castell gettin, All þat cunnand wes for?ettin; For William Oliphant, þat wes þan Capitane þarof, gud Scottis man, He gert be tane and bunding fast, And send to Lundoune at þe last, And put þare in a deip presoune, And lang wes haldin in þat dungeoun; And quhat worth of him mare, perde, I can nocht tell þe certante. Bot eftir þe Pasche ?it monethis thre Soiornand in our land wes he, And all þe land drew till his pess. Bot William Wallace agane him was: Wes noþer castell, nor wallit toune, Na it wes in his habandoune. As Barbour tellis [in] Bruss buke, Quhasa lykis it to luke: Fra Wyke anentis Orknay To Mullyrsnuke in Galloway He put all Inglis natioun, That worthit þan sa oure felloune That Scottis men mycht do na thing That euer mycht be to þar liking. Syne eftir þat þis fell tyrand Held his way hame in Ingland; Bot his sone Edward of Carnaueren, Prince of Waillis, þat tyme þen His luftennend, behind left he, To gere his statutis haldin be. Quhen all þis saw þe Broyss Robert, Quhat wes oure king syne eftirwart, Gret pete of þe folkis he had, Set few wordis he þarof maid; Till it befell at þe Cummyn, As þai come rydand fra Sterlyne, Said till him: “Schir, will ?e nocht se How þat gouernyt is þis cuntre? Thai sla oure folkis but enchesoun, And haldis þis land agane ressoune.” And to record maire of þis taill It nedis nocht now, for ?e alhaill May fynd it in þe Bruss buke, In þe begynnyng quha will luke; And all þat process maire clerely Than I can tell ?ow now trewly. CHAPTER CLII. How Wyntoun him excusis fra wyte, And schawis als quhat he couþ dyte. Heyre Wyntoune poyntis in his dyte Quhat he gert of þis tretiss write, That callit is Originall, Be his study and his travale, Thocht it be sympill, as ?e se. In vii. bukis tretit has he Out of Latyne in oure langage, That quha will may haif full knawlege, Quhat space of ?eris wes gane beforne Or Davy þe Bruss our king wes borne: Sex thousand and five hundreth ?ere, Twenty þarto, or þarby neire, Fra þe warldis begynnyng, Quhill he wes borne to be our king. And for he wald vsurp na fame, Ware þan he seruit nor ?it na blame To beire, forthy in þis poyntment He him excusis; in þat entent He specifyis and makis knawin He cuvatis na mare na his avne, Na maire to desyre of meid Than he deseruit in to deid, In þis present memoriall Lestand to be perpetuall. Till his purposs accordand, As he befor him writtin fand, That in King Davyis dais wes done The Bruss, or Robert his sister sone. Quhat þai did, he wist rycht nocht; Bot, as he fand in writt, he socht, And syne in till þat samyn dyte Consequent he gert writt As he saw þame apperand To be per ordre followand. CHAPTER CLIII. Quhat tyme William Wallace wes tane And send in Ingland syne on ane. A thousand thre hundreth and five ?ere Eftir þe birth of oure Lord deire, Schire Iohne of Menteith in þai dais Tuke in Glasgow William Wallace, And send him in till Ingland sone. Thare he wes quarterit and vndone Be gret dispite and fellony; Thare tholit he þat martery. In all Ingland þare wes nocht þan As William Wallace a lelare man. That he did agane þe natioun, Thai maid him prouocatioun; Na to þaim oblist neuer wes he Off faith, fallowschip, na lawte; For in his tyme, as I herd say, That fals and fekill þai were of fay. A thousand thre hundreth ?ere and xviii. Fra Crist wes borne of Mary clene, Off þe moneth of Iulii The fift day, full solemply The bischop William of Lammyrtoun Maid þe dedicatioun Off þe new kirk cathedrall Off Sanctandrois conuentuall. The king Robert þe Bruss honorably Wes þare in persoune bodely; And vii. bischopis þare wes sene, And abbotis als were þare fiftene, And mony lordis and gentillmen Were þare at þat assemble þen. CHAPTER CLIV. Off King Dauid þe Bruss bering, And of King Edwardis presonyng. A thousand iii?. and xx. ?ere And þarto thre to rekin cleire Eftir þe Incarnatioun, Be evinlike computatioun, As þe clergy of Scotland Comptis þe ?eris concurrand, Off þe moneth of Marche suthly, The King Robertis sone Davy Wes borne in to Dunfermelyne, That regnyt eftir his fader syne. And þat ilk ?ere eftirwart King of Scotland þe Bruss Robert Send ambassatouris in France, To trete and ferme þe allyance Betuix þai mychti kingis twa, Off France and Scotland were þai; That allyance to lest alhaill All tyme fra þin perpetuall.

Thai ambassatouris did rycht weill All þare chargis ilk deill; And ferme maid þe pece and allyance Baith at þe court and in to France. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere The sext to þai withoutin weire, Dame Eli?abeth quene of Ingland, Off gret tressoure haboundand, For wage and for large feis Gaderit wageouris in seire cuntreis.

Erllis als and gret baronis, Mychti lordis of possessionis, Scho gert condampnyt be to dede, But ony fauour or remeid. A haryage he mycht say he had gud, That had sic xii. to stand in stude. And quhen scho had gert þis be done, Edward of Windissore þan hir sone, (He wes callit Edward of Windissore, For he wes borne þarin befor), Xv. ?eris of eild or mare, Saw how þe statis demanit ware, His fader beand in presoune, Gert set vpone his heid þe crovne; Vpone þe Purificatioun day He gert him be vnctit king verray.

CHAPTER CLV. How King Davy þe Bruss wes weddit With King Edwardis sister and beddit. A thousand and iii?. ?ere And xxviii. to þai cleire, The King Robertis sone Davy In Bervik weddit a faire lady, Dame Iane of Towris, þat wes þan Eduardis dochtir of Carnaverane, That ?e haif herd of tell befor, And Edwardis fader of Windissore. Mair of þis quha list to heire, He may fynd writtin all þe manere In King Robert þe Brussis buke, In þe latter end quha will luke.

The gud Erll of Murraif Thomas, Fra gud King Robert beryit was, All þis tyme in to Scotland Wardane wes, þe lawis haldand. Better befor him wist na man The lawis halding, na he held þan. For he gert ordane in þat tyde That, quhat man throu þe land wald ryde, Quhen he lichtit, he suld knyt His brydill fast; and gif at it Happinnit to be stollin away, The schiref of þat land suld pay The price of þat bridill þan, But langer delay, to þat man; And þat, befor all oþer thing, Suld be allowit in his reknyng The nixt compt þat euer þat schiref þare Gaif, quhare haldin were þe chakare.

A gredy man þat tyme wes Birnand in sic gredynes That his plew irnis him self stall, And hid þaim in a petpot all; And plen?eit to þe schiref saire That his plew irnys stollin ware. The schiref þan payit him schillingis twa; And eftir fra he had done sa, Sone a gret court he gert set, Wittering of þat stouth to get. He gert þe dryvere, and other ma, Be examynd, þat syne þai Tald him þat þe carll þaim stall, And hid þaim in a petpot all, For to wyne him sic payment. And þarfor be lele iugement To þe gallouss he gert harll And gert hing vp þat fals sle carll. Syne in Wigtoun he gert set A iustry, þat he held but let. Till him sittand þare come a man, And in his playnt he tald him þan That in a wod þat wes neire by Thare wes a buschement prevely Set, þare him for till haue slane; Bot he gat by þaim with gret payne. A cumpany he send furth þan, And gert þaim tak þai samyn men, At in þat buschement still þai fand. Thai brocht þaim befor him sittand, And he gert mak þaim challans then That to murtheriss þe kingis men Thai abaid sa in buschement. Forthy, be lauchfull iugement, The law he gert þaim suffere þare, As murtheraris of þe kingis men ware. For sa to do it wes þare will; To þai na hap had had to fulfill In deid, at þai in will had thocht, And in to þaim þe let stude nocht. And eftir quhen all þis done wes, Ane iustry he held at Inuerness, Quhare he herd tell þar wes a man That had a preist slane forouth þan. The bischop þarfor handillit him sa fast That to þe court of Rome he past To be assol?eit; fra þin wes he Remyttit hame in his cuntre, Quhare he gat absolutioun, And done had his deuotioun, And fulfillit his pennance weill, That wes inionyt him euerilk deill. ?it þis gud erll, quhare he sat, Off þis ilk man wittering gat At that man wes neire þarby; Than gert he him be tane in hy, And gert bring him in iugisment; And þare he maid him argument Quhy he slew þe kingis man. He said he wes assol?eit þan, Quharfor he trowit him þarof fre; For he wes bot a preist, at he Had slane befor; sa of þat cass All quyt þarof he trowit he was. The erll þan askit him quhais man Wes þat preist, at he slew þan. Bot dout, he said, þat preist liffand Wes þe kingis liege man of Scotland; And, for þe ordour þat he baire, Than othire he wes till him derrare; And, for þe kingis actioun, He suld haue sic pvnitioun As þe law wald gif him þan, For slauchtir of þe kingis man. And þare he gert him with gud speid Thole deid for þe samyn deid. Off his bidding syne als fast To Glandonan his crovnare past, For to arrest mysdoaris þare, Quhare þat tyme rycht mony ware, And þarto gert him purvait be; For to pass þidder sone thocht he. This crovnare with a cumpany Off manly men socht naroly Thire mysdoaris heire and þare, That in his rollis writtin ware. All gat he nocht, bot ?it fifty He gat of þame fleand þarby, As he ourtuke þaim with gret payne, And with þe law þai were all slane, And þe heidis of þaim all Were set vp hie apon a wall Off a toure of Glandonan, Agane þe come of þe wardane, That of þat sicht wes wonder blith. Than to þe court he passit swith, And of þe laif at enterit ware He did full iustice evinlike þare. Bot him nedit nocht to call Thame þat flowrit sa weill þat wall, That were na feware þan fifty Off hedis girnand full vgly. Thare wes neuer na iustice like To þis gud erll in our kinrik; For he na wayndit for luf na aw, As causs askit to do þe law. The realme he held in rest and pess All þe tyme he wardane wes, And þat wes nocht attour foure ?ere; Bot all did he in gud manere. CHAPTER CLVIII. How þe batall of Duplyne Wes throu a wickit manis entysing. In þe samyn tyme þat þis was, The gud Lord Iames of Dowglas In to þe kinrik of Scotland One his purposs wes bydand. In to þe bischoprik of Glasgow Than wes a clerk of gret vertew, And wes þe bischopis officiall. The iurisdictioun he had haill To pvniss exces and trespas; Maister William hattyn he was Off Ekfurd oure all þat land. Than wes a ?oung man by wonnand, That to surname hecht Lowrystoun. He wes wantoun, and had in won, By his wif, oftsyss to ly With oþer wemen in lummanry. Forouth þe officiall he summond was; Bot for he wald nocht leif his trespas, Na do pennance for his misdeid, The strif sa fere betuix þaim ?eid, That þis man fell in sic foly, That he þe officiall can aspy Toward þe toune of Aire rydand; He tuke him rudly, and him band, And, or he past, he gert him pay A gret sovme of gud monay. The Lord Dowglass, at þat tyme was Makand him redy for to pass His viage in þe Halyland, As he befor had tane on hand, Gert seik þis man sa naroly That he be slycht all prevely In mekle dout passit þe se; And to þe Balliole syne come he, And said him þat he wes his man; And sua inducit he him þan To purchess help, and tak on hand For to raiss weire in to Scotland; And þarto gaif he his assent. This wes þe first atysment That muffit all þat weire. Lo! how litill thing may gere Gret harme fall in mony wyss, As men has sene, and seis oftsyss. This Schir Eduard þe Ballioll þan Throu þe entysing of þis man, As men sais, past þan in Ingland; And þare he sindry lordis fand, That clamyt to hald landis of fe In Scotland; and sone þai and he Maid þare confideratioun, And for þat weire þai maid þaim bovne. Schire Henry þe Bewmond wes ane, Quham at þar counsall wes mast tane, For he wes wyss and rycht werty; The Erll of Archelle syne Davy, Cummyne, Talbot, and Mowbray, And mony ma þan I can say. Bot for þai wist þe Erll Thomas Off Murrave ?it þan liffand was, That followit nocht of þat empriss; For þe Bewmond, þat wes wiss, Said at it gret wonder wes Gif God, of his gret rychttiusnes, Wald thole þat sa rychttiuss a knycht, [That] sa manteinyt law and rycht, To be vincust in to weire. Tharefor with slicht þai thoucht to gere Him with sum venamuss poisoun Be distroyit, and with tressoun; And þat þai brocht sone till ending Be sum tressonable vndirtaking; For at þe Wemys neire þe se Poysound at a fest wes he. And fra þai wist at he wes deid, With all þe folk at þai mycht leid, In hy þai put þame to þe se. Men callit þame bot a few men?e, Bot xv. hundreth fechtand men. Forþi feill folkis had ferly þen At þai, but convoying in þe land, Sa hie a thing durst tak on hand. CHAPTER CLIX. How þe batall [strikkin] was Off Duplyne and quhat þare done was. A thousand and thre hunder ?ere And thre and xxx. þarto cleire, One Sanct Margaret þe Madinis day, The gud Erll Thomas, þat þan lay In hard seiknes, [?ald þan] þe gaist To God, þat is of mychtis mast. And eftir þat his dais wes done, The statis of Scotland gaderit sone, Bischopis, erllis, and baronis, And vthire famouss gret personis, All togidder at Sanct Iohnestoune. Eftire gret huge discencioun, At þe last, all þat þare ware, Ordanit Donald, Erll of Mare, To be wardane of þe land; For oure king þan wes haiffand Bot ix. ?eris, but ma, of eild, Oure waik wappinnis for to weild. And on þe morne eftir Lambes day, Quhen þis wes ordanit at I say, It wes þaim tald þat at Kingorne, Bot twa dais þan gane beforne, Edward þe Ballioll had tane land With a gret flot of Ingland; And Alexander of Setoun, þat him set Than to tak land rycht þare but let, At ane assalt slane wes he, And discomfit were his men?e; And quhen he þus wes done of daw Than tuke þai land but dreid or aw. The wardane and þe statis þare, Fra þai herd þat sa few þai ware, That sa aryvit in þare cuntre, Thai trowit þat lang þai wald nocht be Bydand in it; ?it neuerþeles To land þai come, all þat þare wes, And restit þaim a quhile; and syne Thare way thai tuke to Dunfermlyne; And þarin all a quhile þai lay, And send þar schippis about to Tay. And in þis tyme our all þe land The word raikit fra hand to hand, That sa few folkis in þar cuntre Durst tak þe land, and leif þe se. The Scottismen maid myrth and play, And oftsyss wald amang þaim say, Lattand a crak, þat mony mycht heire, In hething: “Tak a Henhald heire.” For Henhaldis wiþ þaim wageouris ware; Forthy dispysit þai þaim þe mare; And for þai few were, and þai mony, Thai lett of þaim þe maire lichtly. And sa suld nane do þat were wiss: Wisemen suld dreid þar innemyss; For [hethynes] and succudry Drawis to defoulling commonely. On south half þe Scottis Se þan The Erll Patrik wes a wardane, And had þe land in gouernall, Ordanit be þe gret counsall. And quhen he herd þare aryving, He maid a generall gadering; And sa athire of þaim with batall Schupe þare fais till assaill. With ilkane, as men baire on hand, Were gaderit weill xxx. thousand. The Erll of Mare with his folkis ferd To Sanct Iohnestoune, and þare he herd That all his fais cummyn ware To Fortevyot, and þai þare Had lugeit þaim in litill space; The Myllaris Akyre it callit was; And sum men sais baith horss and man In þat Akyre wes lugeit þan. Be?ond Erne a litill fra The Scottis men come to þe bra Twa bowdraucht, or þan litill mare; Thai lichtit doune, and restit þare, For it nychtit þaim fast; and þai Thocht to byde þare till þe day. Thai sent to Perth for wyne and aill, And drank and playit, and gaif na taill Off þare fais at lay þaim by, That semyt to be stad straitly. For lyand forouth þaim evin ware The gret oste with þe Erll of Mare, And behind þaim v. myle neire At Vchtireardour lyand were The Erll Patrik wiþ all his rout, That wes a gret oste and a stout; Sa þat it semyt þat þai were set Amangis þare fais, as fische in net. I trow þai wald haif bene away. Bot I haue herd ofttymes say That dispaire giffis hardyment; For quhene trowis in þare entent That þai can se nane oþer remeid Bot ouþer to do or þan be deid; To wenge þar deid þai tuke þan will, And sa takis hardyment þaim till. Tharfor said Scipio þe wiss That men suld gif þar innemyss Laysere to fle, þat were straitly Stad, for sa men sall lichtly Ourecum þame; for quha to flycht [Him] settis, tynis baith hert and mycht. I trow sa fell it in þis caiss; For þai few folk, at closit was With þare fais, as I herd say, Maid þaim redy befor day, And withoutin noyiss or cry Passit þe watter prevely, That nane þat sat vpon þe bra Wist it, for þai maid myrthis sa That þai set on þaim na keping; For þai dred nocht þare ourecuming. Men sais ane met þaim in þe furd, That prevely withoutin word Let þaim by þe watter syne, Quhill þai to þe Gask come and Duplyne. Thare mony wes lugeit of Scottis men; Off þe mast pairt slew þai þen. Syne to þe gret oste held in hy, That be þe noyss and be þe cry Off þaim þat slane or stekit ware, That þai herd hiely cry and rare, Thai wist þat þai were by þaim past. Forthy þai maid þame redy fast, And to þaim held þai on þar way; Bot scalit sa þat tyme were þai That þai togidder were nocht then Attour aucht hundreth armyt men. The Erll of Murray, ?oung Thomas, In to þat rout a chiftane was; The Erll of Menteth Murtho alsua, Alexander þe Fresale ?ounger, with þai Robert þe Bruss, þat to þe King Robert wes sone, in þat gadering. The Erll of Mare, þat wardane was, Wes neire by in ane oþer place. The first rout held vp straucht þar way, And sone as it wes dawing day, Thare fais in þe face þai met; Thai smat togidder but langer let. Men sais þat þe Inglismen þare One bak gret space ruschit ware; Till at þe Baroune of Stamfurd On hicht with a full haltand word Bad stand a put; bot nocht forthy Sindry men trowit rycht fermely That, had þai had to fle laysere, Thai had bene discomfit þare. Bot Erll Donald come hastely. Wald he haif anys assemblyt by, The ourehand þai had had but dout; Bot he with all his mekle rout Come on behind, and all doune baire That euer he fand befor him þare. Thare wes þe mischeif sa cruell, That quhasa in þat gret thrang fell Had neuer laisere to ryss agane. On þat wiss smorit were and slane Weill twa thousand, as by gess. The Erll of Murray slane þare wes, And Erll Murthow, Bruss, and Fresall, And a thousand, as I herd tell, And ma wes smorit in þat place, Quhare drop of blude nane drawin wes. The Erll of Mare þare deit alsua. Hereby men may enssample ta, That better is ordinance in till fecht Sumtyme, þan ony strenth or mycht. And Caton sais, of oþer thing Men may oft mak amending Quhen men trespast hes; bot in fecht, Quhen men vnreullit are or vnrycht, Men may it nocht weill mend agane, For in þe nek followis þe pane. And quhen þe feild þus vencust was, The Inglismen followit on þe chass, And towart Perth has tane þe way. A knycht of þaim, as I herd say, Left on þe feild his cousing slane; Tharfor with all his men agane He turnyt, and with oþer ma, In till entent vengeans to ta For his cousing, þat slane wes. And quhen he cummyn wes to the place, And saw þe lwmp sa lathly ly, He gert his folkis stand still him by, And said þare in till audiens: “Quhat! suld I eik to Goddis vengeans? It were bot oure gret cruelte; For quhy all men may opinly se That þis is Goddis deid playnly.” Than followit he his folkis in hy. The Erll Patrik, þat lay þat nycht At Wchterardour, quhen day wes lycht, Buskit him till his fais to faire. And, as he raid, sa met he þare Ane of þe Murrayis, as I herd say, Off Tulybardy be þe way, His bowellis him befor berand; And sone at him þai sperit tythand; He tald þaim how þe feild wes gane. Than twa discouerouris haif þai tane, Ane Schir Adam Mure, þai say, The toþer Schir Alexander Ramsay. The erll bad þaim ryde in a lyng To se quhat done wes of þat thing; And þai raid to þe batall place, For all þe Inglismen þan was Went to Sanct Iohnestoun þar way. Wonderand a quhile þar huffit þai, Behaldand how ferlifully Thai saw þar folk on vthire ly Sa he, þat quha on a half were Rydand suld nocht se his feire On oþer half, sa hie þai lay Heipit on oþer, þe suth to say. The Erll Patrik and his men?e Syne come þat ferlifull sicht to se. Fra þin to Londorkyne þai raid, And þare ilk man a fagot maid, Syne to Sanct Iohnestoun held þar way With þai fagotis, and thocht at þai Suld oure þe dykis sodanely To þare fais pass planely. Thame semyt ane haire wod to be; And quhen þai within can þaim se, Thai were abaisit gretumly, And schupe þaim stoutly þan in hy Twnnys and pipis þan to ta, And durris and wyndois þan alsua, To mak þaim barress and brettyss. Thai wrocht a quhile, as I deviss, Syne saw þe Scottismen in þe bra Stand, and a lang resting ma. And quhen þe Bewmond þat can se, He said till his: “Luke at ?e sa be Mery and glaid, and haiffis na dout; For we haue freyndis in ?one rout.” Men sais on þis wiss he spak þare; And sone þe Scottismen, þat ware Huffand togidder on þe bra, Quhen þai a quhile had huffit sa, Thai turnyt and awaywartis raid. Men trowit fermly and þai had Went to þe tovne, wiþ litill pane Thai mycht haif tane þar fais and slane, And of þat weire haif maid ending. Bot fortoune, with hir fals changeing, That ay werrayis prosperite, Sufferit nocht at it sa suld be. Thare takin wes þe Erll of Fife; [Thar] vnder his banere left [þe] lif Thre hunder and sexti gentilmen, That armyt at all poynttis were þen. Thus went þe Scottismen þar way; Quhat causs þai had, I can nocht say. Bot quheþer at þai had causs or nane, Ilkman till his resset is gane. Quhen þai were went, þe Inglismen, That in till Perth were lyand þen, Liffit all at þar liking, And doutit na mare oure cummyng. The toune rycht þan þai closit all, And envyround it with mud wall. The bodyis at slane were at Duplyne, Fully nomerit and sovmyt syne, Passit, men sayis, thre thousand, Deid on þat feild and left liffand. The Erll of Fif Duncane þen, And þe bischop of Dunkelden William Sinclare, and oþer ma Prelatis, and mony gentillis alsua Off Fif, Fothrik, and Gowry, And of Stratherne halely, Past with Edward þe Balliole sone, And crovnit him for king at Scone. Bot þe crovne, at he þare gat, He had bot schort quhile eftir þat; For our King Davy had tane þe crovne, And ioysit in possessioun Wynteris and ?eris before gane, Set Edwart it till him had tane. That samyn ?ere on ordinance Oure King Davy wes send in France; Thare he resauit wes rycht weill, And tretit in all eiss ilk deill; And nyne ?eris fully he wes þare, Honorit baith with less and mare. And Dene William of Dalgarnow, That tyme abbot of Kelsow, Wes his techour all þis tyme, Kepit in a castell fyne, That standis in to Normundy, Castell Galliard callit suthly. That ilk ?ere Iames Bene, Bischop of Sanctandrois then, To Briggis passit oure þe se; His latter day þare closit he. To þe abbay of Armburgh þare Chanons foundit seculare; Entyrit þare his body lyis, His spirit in till Paradiss. Sanctandrois se ?eris nyne Eftire him it vaikit; syne The chapiter be electioun Chesit a famouss gret persoune, Maister William Bell callit þen, That tyme dene of Dunkelden. Throu oppositionis agane him wrocht, And oþer defaltis, it gat he nocht. For William Landals, þat wes þan A ?oung clerk, and a gret gentilman, Set him for þat stait sa fast That he optenit it at þe last; And on quhat wiss it wes done, ?e may heire noweftir sone. Qwhen þis Balliole wes crovnit þen, In Sanct Iohnestoun þe Inglismen Ordanit keparis; and syne þai Southwartis on þai tuke þe way To Connynghame, and to Erwyne; Till Anand southwartis held þai syne. And þare a langtyme can þai ly, And tuke to þare pess þare sindry Off gentillis of þat ilk cuntre, That come and maid þaim þar fewte. Schire Alexander þe Bruss perfay, Than lord of Carrik and Galloway, Come to þar peiss, and oþer seire, That I can nocht now rekin heire. Off þis tyme, þat I of tell, Gud Schir Symond Fresall, And his broþer with him alsua, ?oung Robert of Keith, and oþer ma, Past with þaim to Sanct Iohnestoun, And wan with manly fecht þat tovne. With stout and manfull assal?eing Thai tuke and slew at þar liking; And kest doune all þe wallis þare, And left bot as befor þai ware. The Erll of Fife, callit Duncane, That Edward Balliole left capitane, And his dochtir, with oþer ma That pertenit till him alsua, That Scottis were be natioun, All þai tuke vp in þat toune. Andro þai tuke of Tulybard; But dout wiþ him þe court stude hard: For he wes conuickit wiþ tressoun Aganis þe king and his crovne. For þi to þat deid done he was, As law wald for sic felloune cass. CHAPTER CLX. How Schir Andro of Murref wes tane, That þan of Scotland wes wardane. And or þat all þis tyme wes gone, The ?oung Erll of Murray Iohne, And Schir Archbald of Dowglass, That gud Schir Iames broþer was, Purchest þame a cumpany, A thousand wicht men and hardy. Till Anand in a tranoynting Thai come on þaim in þe dawing. Thare were sindry gudmen slane. Schire Henry þe Ballioll þan agane With a staff focht sturdely, And delt dyntis rycht douchtely, That men him lowit eftir his day. Thare deit als Schir Iohne þe Movbray. Schire Alexander þe Bruss wes tane; Bot þe Balliole his gate is gane One a barme horss with leggis baire; Sa fell þat he eschapit þare. The laif, þat were nocht tane in hand, Fled quhare þai best mycht till warand; Sa þat all þat cumpany Were discomfit halely. The Scottismen syne, þat had dreding That Schir Edward of Ingland king Suld cum with mycht in to þar land, As he did nocht agane standand The pess þat oblist wes and maid And confermyt with seillis braid, Maid ordinance þar land to saif. And to þe Erll Patrik þai gaif Berwik castell in keping; And þe toune in gouernyng Thai gaif till Alexander of Cetoun, That wes a knycht of gret renovne. Schire Andro of Murray, gud and wycht, And of manheid a noble knycht, That nane wes better in his day, Fra gud King Robert wes away, Thai maid him wardane of þe land. And, fra he tuke þat stait on hand, He gert summond þe folkis in hy, And þai assemblit till him haly. And with þaim þan he held his way To Roxburght, þare þe Balliole lay, And had befor in Ingland bene, And of gentillis and ?emen keyne Gaderit a rycht gret cumpany. Schire Andro þidder can him hy; Bot his men held nocht all array; For sum ?oung men, as I herd say, Come on þe brig; bot Inglismen Sa gret debait maid wiþ þaim þen That þai weill sone were put away; The brig syne eftir oppinnit þai. And in reskew of Rauf Gelding, That wes borne doune oure a mydding, Schire Andro of Murray out of his staill, That wend þat all his men?e haill Had followit him, bot þai did nocht sa, For sum of þaim were fere him fra, And oþer sum out of array, For at poynt purvait nocht were þai, Sa þat full few wiþ him were gane, And he weill neire left him allane, To þe brig he went sturdely, Wenand his men had bene him by, And maid sic pay þat men sais ?it That he gert feill fall at his feit Sprewland, as þai chekinnis ware. And quhen his fais saw him þare Foroutin feire fechtand allane, Thai schot on him, and has him tane In þare armes, and he in hy Twrnyt him about swiftly For to luke about his awne men, That he wend at his bak were þen; Than all þe Inglis cumpany Behind stert on him sodanely, And magre his þai haif him tane; Bot trewly he ?ald him to nane. END OF THE FIFTH VOLUME. VOL. VI. CHAPTER CLXI. How þe batall of Halydone Hill Wes done þat did ws mekle ill. A thousand iii?. thretty and thre ?eris eftir þe Natiuite, In þe moneth of Aprile syne Nixt eftir þe batall of Duplyne, Fra Schir Andro of Murray wes tane, And all his men?e hame wer gane, Thocht he wes takin þus of cass, ?oldin ?it to na man he was, Till he wes brocht in till presand To þe King Edward of Ingland; Till him þan ?ald he his body. Bot þar wes na man þat stude by, That neuer durst say þare þat he Wes ?oldin forouth presonere to be. And þat ilk tyme at Lowmabane Off Annandirdaill þe floure wes tane With weire with þe West Merche men, That had þaim in till Ingland þen. And amangis þaim William of Dowglass Takin, and had to presoune was. ?it wes bot erllis for to tell Off mysfortovnys þat eftir fell. For of þat moneth forouth May, That ?e herd me befor say, The King of Ingland come of weire With his oste and gret powere, Off Walis, Gascone, and his kinrik, And plantit a sege about Berwik. And of Scotland ?it mony men, That duelt with Edwart Balliole þen, That were manly men and stout, Were þai in þe kingis rout. The toune straitly assegit he Baith be land and als be se, And fast assal?eit it aday; Bot þai were dongin weill away. Thare William of Setoun facht sa fast Amangis þe schippis, till at þe last His fader, þan capitane of þe tovne, In to þe se þare saw him drovne. Within þe tovne ?it nocht forthy Thai were dredand full gretumly; Tharfor of ?elding tretit þai, That gif þai be a certane day Ware nocht reskewit be batall, Thai suld gif vp þe tovne but faill. Schire Alexander of Cetoune, That tyme capitane of þe tovne, This till halding beand done, Deliuerit in ostage þare his sone Thomas, þat wes þan his aire, A plesand ?oung man and a faire. To þat terme wes takin neire The space þe quarter of a ?ere. Schire Archibald of Dowglass, That þan wardane of Scotland was, Gaderit haly all þe men That worthy were in Scotland þen, And semblit fully sexty thousand, And þan past in Ingland, To do þare all þe harme þai may. For þan þat herescheip weill [thoucht] þai To gere þaim set for þare cuntre, At þat assegis suld raisit be; And sa it suld, I trow, perfay, And þai had haldin furtht þar way. Thai schawit þaim at Sanyne Syde, And syne schupe on þar way to ryde. Bot þai, þat in to Bervik lay, Send to þaim, and can þaim say At þai mycht fecht, for þai were ma And semyt better bodin alsua. Thai trowit þare entysment; To þe Park of Dunss þai went; Thare in all þat nycht þai lay, And thocht vpon þe morne at day With þar fais till haue met, And for þe toune sum help to set. Inglismen þan alsfast, That saw þe terme wes nere hand past, At Schir Alexander of Cetoune Askit deliuerance of þe tovne; Bot, for þat he reskewing baid, Deliuerance nane to þaim he maid. Than for dispite and fellony Ane hie gallouss þai maid in hy, That Schir Alexander mycht se His sonnys þaron hangit be. The fader and þare moder alsua Thus saw vndone þare sonnys twa In to þe defens of þat tovne, At þai held of þar king wiþ crovne. The dule, at þai had of þat sicht, Amesit wes mekle for þe rycht That þai wist fell to þar king. Than said þe lady scho wes ?ung, And hir lord wes ?oung alsua, Off powere till haue barnis ma, To þat þai twa deid wes þare; And ?it of þare sonnys ma liffand ware. Forþi scho prayit hir lord þat he Suld nocht þarfor discomfit be, Bot set bot litill by þat scaith; Sen þai in honour endit baith To þaim selfin and all þar kyn; And he mare worschip is like to wyn To spend þaim baith for his fewte, That of det aucht to sauffit be For his cuntre, als lang beforne His elderis did or he wes borne. Thus wes þis lady of comford, Quhen scho disesit saw hir lord. Fra Dunss Park till Halydoune, Quhare þai mycht rycht weill se þe tovne, Thare fais als, and þare harbery, And saw þaim to þe fecht reddy, One Sanct Margret þe Virginis day. All arrayit to fecht were þai; And þe Scottismen arrayit þaim haill, And held to þaim in plane batall; Bot þai considerit nocht þe place; For a gret syke betuix þaim was, And on ilk syde wes brayis stay. At þat gret syke assemblit þai, Quhare þame behuffit first doune to ga, Syne on þare fais clyme vp þe bra, Quhare a man mycht discomfit thre; Bot þat [þai] couth nocht forouth se. Forthy all þat assemblit þare Rycht sodanely discomfit ware. Bot Hew þe Erll of Ross, þai say, That assemblit in þe hie way, Maid stalwart and rycht lang fechting, That seruit bot of litill thing; For he wes slane, and all his men [Ware] lyand all about him þen. Quhen þire folkis þus discomfit wes, The Inglismen followit on þe chass, And in þat chaiss þai slew mony. Syne on þe morne þe king gert cry That all presoneris slane suld be. That to behald wes gret pete, That mycht nocht help þaim self na thing Sa to be slane without sparing. ?it all were nocht slane; for gud men For pete sauffit þare presoneris then; And sa quhat þare, quhat in þe fycht, Sauffit were mony worthy knycht. Schire Archibald of Dowglass, That þan wardane of Scotland was, And Hew þe Erll of Ross then, And with him mony Northin men Off Kennyhaw Erll of Suthireland, With þaim bunding in speciall band, And Alexander þe Bruss alsua Erll of Carrik, als with þai The Stewartis broþer of Scotland Iames, [þat] hardy wes of hand, And with him his breþer twa, Iohne and Allane callit were þai, And thre breþer of þe Fresallis, Andro, Symond, and Iames it tellis, All þire in þat fecht were slane, And mony ma, þe suth to sayne, Off Scottis lordis bald and wicht, That I can nocht tell quhat þai hicht. Be nomer sovmyt were þe men, That slayne in to þe fecht were þen, Off armyt men fully x thousand, Manly men and weill farand. Halydoune þat steid forthy Wes callit eftir commonely. Be þis fechting men may knaw Thame selfin, and dreid Godis aw; Quha will nocht knaw him self for pryde, He sall tak scaith or schame sum tyde. For wissmen in ald proverbis sayis: “Pride gais befor, and schame alwayis Followis þaron als fast It oure takis at þe last.” Pride is oft ourtane wiþ scaith, Or ellis with schame, or ellis wiþ baith, Be þir forsaid men I say, For pride þat kend nocht þaim self þat day, And set nocht befor þaim God of mycht, That oft rewillit þaim befor in fycht Agane þe gret mycht of Ingland. At Bannaburne, Myttoun, and Byland, Throu Goddis help and his gret grace The victory ay þairis wes; And at Roslyne als on a day Thriss fechtand in hard assay, Ay haiffand God maist in þar thocht, All þar fais þai brocht to nocht; Ay ilk tyme fechtand þen In feild ay wan þe Scottismen. All pomp and pryde þai put ferby, And thocht on God ay ythandly, And ekit þar manheid and þar mude, And gert þaim vencuss ay a multitud. Quhen þire folkis þus wes dongin dovne, The Erll Patrik ?ald vp þe tovne, And þare become þe kingis man. Sa sekerly delt he with him þan, He gert him of his costage Mak vp Dunbare, and of his wage. The Inglismen eftir þis fycht Persauit þe Scottismen waik of mycht Agane þar mekle mycht to stand. To þame þai tuke vp all þe land, And to þare peiss tuke all þe men, That in þe land were wonnand then; And maid bal?eis, schireffis, and iustiss, And all oþer officiaris on þar wiss, Throu out all Scotland lang and wyde, Sa þat all were Inglis þat tyde, Outtane foure castellis and a peill; Thare names can I tell ?ow weill. Dunbertane wes principall; For to þat place reparit haill All þat ?arnyt to lif frely; Thare Malcome Flemyng þe worthy Wes of þat castell capitane. Syne wes Lochlevin, þarof Allane Wepont wes lord and ledare, Gouernyt him wisly all þat weire. The thrid castell wes Kindromy, Dame Cristiane þe Bruss stoutly Held with knychtis and squyeris, Greiffit þare fais on seire maneris. Syne Urqhart wes þe fourt castell, That Schir Robert of Lawder weill Held and kepit wittely, And dantit weill his fais him by. Syne wes þe peill in to Lowdoun, The quhilk þan held Iohne Thomsoun With few men, for it till assay Wes weill fere out of þe way. CHAPTER CLXII. How Edward þe Ballioll tuke party Agane seire lordis of arbitry A thousand iii?. and xxx. ?ere And foure þarto, to rekin cleire, Eftir þe blessit Natiuite, That wes þe causs of all our gle, The King Phillip þat tyme of France, For till amese þe gret distance That wes betuix þe realmes twa, Scotland and Ingland baith were þai, Send honorable message and grete Vpone ferme trewis for to trete, With þe Paip Benettis consent The xii.; with his letre? patent, In Scotland to Perth þai went To þe King Edward þare present; Bot he wald nocht þe message se, Nouþer in pert nor in prevate. The King of France ?it eftir þai Send to þis Edwart ?it message ma, The quhilk wes kend and knawin then Rycht honorable and famouss men, With þe consent of Davy ?ing, At þat tyme wes in France our king, Be baith þare instance and consent, And als be þare letre? patent, For to trete a trew fermly. This Edward refusit it vtraly. That samyn ?ere in Sanct Iohnestoun Thare raiss ane gret descentioun Betuix Edward þe Ballioll þen And lordis þat were his sworne men, Richart Talbot, and Schir Henry The Bewmond, and þe Erll Davy Off Aithale, agane þis Edwart; For he hely fauorit þe part That langit Schir Alexander Mowbray. For fra his broþeris dochteris away All þare heretage þan tuke he, That to þai madinnis fell of fee. Thire thre lordis fra þis Edwart Withdrew þaim, for he faworit þat part That langit, as I said, Mowbray; And þire thre lordis held þar way, Fra þai had þar leif þus tane, Quhare þai likit euerilkane. Schire Edward þe Balliole þat tyme baid In Sanct Iohnestoun, and þare he maid The landis lyand him about To be till him vndirlout. The Bewmont went on to Bowchane, And þare Dundarge of lyme and stane He maid stalwart, and þarin lay. All þat in Bouchane were þat day Obeyit till him halely, And oþer landis ma þarby. Richard Talbot in Louthiane, Passand till Ingland, þan wes tane And with him alsua all his men As presoneris were takin þen. Off Aithaile þan past þis Erll Davy To Loghindorb with his cumpany. Bot þe Balliole þis Schir Edwart Tretit with þire lordis eftirwart, And remuffit fra him away This Schir Alexander Mowbray, That to Schir Andro of Murray þan Become þare his suorne man; For he doutit þe gret mycht Off his vnfreyndis, and þare slycht. This Schir Edward þe Ballioll þen Gaif landis till his suorne men; To þis Erll of Athaill Schir Davy The Stewartis landis he gaif halely; For he desyrit oure þe laif Off lordschip liffing for to haif. And at Ranfrow a maniory He maid costlike and ryally, And fewteis tuke of mony þare, That gaderit to þat assemble ware, And aucht fewteis for tennandriis; For nane durst him contrariis. The keyis þai brocht him þare, That in Dunoyne and Rothsa were. Schire Allane þe Lile he maid haill Schirref of Bute and of Kowaill; Thome of Wollare of all þat land He maid eftir him luftennand. Quhen þis Balliole in Perth abaid, Mony chiftanis þare he maid Off castellis, and cuntreis neire him by Off Fife, and Anguss, and oþer sindry. William Bulloke þe castell Off Cowper kepit, and warnyt weill, And þe castell of Andirstoun, And vthir pelis vp and doune, All bestuffit with Inglismen; This Edward sa gret lord wes þan. In all þis tyme, at þai þus ferd, The Stewart of Scotland Robert Wes þan bot ?oung, withoutin weire Off eild he past nocht xvii. ?ere, In hiddillis wes þan in Rothsay; And all þe tyme þat he þare lay, Iohne Gibsone, þat wes trew man, And Willok Hereot, þat wes þan Wynnand within þat barony, Tretit and wrocht sa wittely That in ane evinnyng in a bait Fra Rothissay þai held þar gait Till Innerkip; þare horss þaim met, And þat ilk nycht, but langere let, With twa men, at his charteris baire, And a chalmer child but mare, This Stewart Robert held his way Till Ovire Cunno, and or day A litill cobill þare him met, And had him oure, but langere let, To þe castell of Dunbertane. Thare he with glaid chere in wes tane With Schir Malcome Flemyng worthy, That tretit him full honorably. CHAPTER CLXIII. How þe stuf within Lochlevin Discomfit þar assegiouris evin. A thousand and thre hunder ?ere And xxxv. to þai clere Fra lichtare wes þe clene Virgyne, A knycht callit Schir Iohne of Striuelyne, That of fewte wes þat day At þe King of Inglandis fay, With a weill gret multitud Off manly men, stalwart and gud, Sum þat wes borne Inglismen, Sum Scottis, bot Inglis suorne þen, Michell of Arnot ane of þai, Davy and Michell of Wemys alsua, And ane alsua Richard Malwyne, With mony oþer in þat tyme That to þe King of Ingland Off fewte suorne had maid him band, All samyn for till assege evin The castell þat stude in till Lochlevin, Fra þe Mydlenterne þat ?ere þare About þat [sege] þai liand ware. And as þai spyit it all about, Thame thocht þat þare wes nocht wiþout Na place to ly in sa plesand, Na to þar purposs sa ganand, As wes þe kirk ?ard of Kynross. For in it of set purposs Thai lugeit þaim, þar for to be Bydand ay oportunyte Oftsyss, as þar hertis wes set That ilk castell for to get. Tharein þai maid þar herbery, And kest and maid þar iuperdy. Set þai were callit Cristin men, Thai did na Cristin dedis þen, In to þat hallowit place to ly Thare kingis castell till aspy, To þare innemyss capitale To wyn þaim of weire þat castall. Capitane of þat castell þan Wes Allane Wepont, a gud man, And Iakis Lame, a burgess he Wes of Androstonys cete. Thir twa kepit þat castell, And stuffit it, and defendit weill. Fra of Mydlenterne þe Sonday The folkis, þat in þe kirk?ard lay, Inbuschmentis and assaultis maid All þe tyme þat þai þar baid. And fra Sanct Iohnestoun all þat quhile, That wes fra þaim bot x. myle, Oft renewit þai were with men For till assal?e þe castell þen. Befor þat castell þus þai lay Till Sanct Margaret þe Quenys day. And þat day Schir Iohne of Striuelyne Passit with his court to Dunfermelyne, And all þe gentillis þat with him ware. And in þe tyme þat þai were þare, The stuff, at wes in þe casteill, Gat gud wittering, and wist weill, That with Schir Iohne of Striuelyne Thare fais were past to Dunfermelyne, Than ischit and sone tuke land. The Inglismen, þat were bydand Behind to kep þar forslatis, Fra þai beheld and saw howgatis The castellwartis land had tane, Than mellit þai wiþ þaim in bargane, Quhare men were slane on athire syde, And mony woundit als þat tyde. And quhen þai had þar fouchtin fast, The castellwartis wan at þe last All þe forslatis, and tuke þe men, And all oþer gudis at þai fand þen, Wittale, clething and riches, That to þare willis plesand wes, And gert in to þare batis lay, And chasit all þar fais away. Behind þaim left þai nakyn thing, That þare batis away mycht bring: Ablastaris, and bowis of viss, And all þat euer mycht mak seruice, Or help þaim in to press of weire, All þai gert þar batis beire To þe castell; and þat done, Word come to Dunfermelyne sone. Than narrer wod he wes na wraith, And swore mony ane awfull aith That he suld neuer rest, na blyn, Till he þat castell of forss suld wyn; Na fra þat sege suld he nocht ga, Till all þai castellwartis he suld sla, At þan within þe castall ware. Sa maid he him to soiorne þare In to þat sege a wele lang quhile, And oft wes set in gret perile. The castellwartis þan oft and fast Had at him sa, till at þe last He persauit all at he wrocht Helpit him litill or þan nocht; With þaim he maid a smale trete, And sa out of þe land gat he, With a weill mare gretare schame Than he had haldin him at hame. That ilk ?ere, quhen þis wes done, A flote of schippis in Forth come sone Eftir þe Sanct Petir mess, Off Iulii quhen þe first day wes. Amangis þe cragis, þat of ald In Scotland are þe Wolffis cald, The gretest schip of þaim all Brak þare in pecis small, And Scottismen þan þidder past, And all þe gudis tuke vp fast. The King of Ingland and Edward The Ballioll come eftirwart To Glasgow, and held a counsall þare; Syne drew þaim quhare þar schippis ware, Or nere þarby, syne als fast Togidder þai in Ingland past. The Erll of Athale þan Davy Off all þe Stewartis sen?eory Had tane manrent and fewte; He leit all at his will suld be. Quhen he had done his willis þare, He tuke his viage for to faire Attour þe Month, and all þe land, [That] Iohne Cummyn had quhile in hand, He sesit till him as of fee; And þare a wele lang tyme duelt he. Thus wes þe kinrik of Scotland Sa haill in Inglismenis hand That na man durst þaim þan ganesay. At sa gret mischeif þan were þai, That barnys, þat na kyndly skill Had to deme betuix gud and ill, Na couþ nocht fen?e, bot furþ say, For þar king wes borne a barne as þai, Quhen men wald speire quhais men þai were, Rycht pertly wald þai mak ansuere, That þai were all King Davyis men; Thus said þai ilkane generaly þen. This wes forsuth preuocatioun That he suld ioiss eftir þe crovne; And sa he did withoutin weire, As in þire cornikillis ?e may heire; For mischeif lestis nocht all wayis. Forþi suld men, as Caton sais, Haif stalwart hartis and hardy, Quhen þai are scaithit wranguisly. CHAPTER CLXIV. How Robert Stewart, at syne wes king, Faucht and first maid releving. Off misfortonis now haif I tald; Now were gud to tell, quha sa wald, Quham throu raiss first recouering Off comfort and of solasing. The Stewart wes in Dunbertane, That hevely in hert has tane That of Athale þe Erll Davy Sa occupiit his sen?eory. Than in Ergile wes a baroune, That had rycht gret affectioune To þis ilk Stewart ?oung Robert; And als his will wes till aduert Till þe Scottismenis party, And wonnyt at Lochschaw nereby. The Stewart send for him, and he Come till him sone, and his men?e. Sa spak þai, þat he tuke on hand To help him for to wyn his land, And to mak it þe Stewartis fre. Dougall Campbell to name hecht he. Thai gaderit men till at þai ware Foure hundreth, as men said, or mare, And in to galays by þe se To Dunnoyne went all þat men?e, And with gud trete wan it sone, And has gud keparis in it done. And quhen þe Brandanis of Bute herd say At þare lord in to sic array Had won Dunone in Kowall, In hy with him þai raiss alhaill; And he þaim thankit of þare rysing, And hecht to mak þaim rewarding. Than þai assemblit þat ilk day Neire by, quhare þe schiref lay. Thare at þe schiref had dispite, And bad his men ga arme þaim tyte, And ischit and can on þaim ga Quhare þai were standand in a bra; Thare plente wes of stanis round. Thare met þai in a litill stound; With stanis þare þai maid sic pay, For of þaim þare enew had þai, That þe schiref þare wes slane. Iohne Gibsone in handis wes tane, That hecht to gif vp þe castell, And þarof held he cunnand weill; And, for þai þare wiþ stanis faucht, And wan þar fais with gret macht, ?it amang þe Brandalis all The Batall Dormanght þai it call. And quhen þe Stewart herd þis deid, To þaim in hy he can him speid, And tuke þe castell, and þarin maid Keparis, þat it in ?emsall had; And bad þe Brandanis ask þar meid, That þai wald haif for þar gud deid. Thai askit to be multir fre; And þat with gud will grantit he. Than had he wonnyng till his hand Nyne hundreth merkis worþ of land. In þe samyn tyme at þis wes, William of Carroiss raiss With his breþer, þat were manly Lines 4362–4431 are taken from the Cottonian ms. Lines 4156–4225 of the Wemyss ms. are missing from the source document. And gat til hym a companny, Þat as schawadouris war walkande In til þe wail of Anande. And richt in to þe samyn qwhille Thomlyne þe Bruys rasse in to Kylle. Þir folk had litil companeis, Þe qwheþir þai rasse in seyr parteys. And son eftyr þe Erl Iohun Off Murrawe in a coge allo?

Þe ?onge Stewart of Scotlande þen In gret hy gadryt his me?; And þaim þat laye in Dunberto? Al hallely wiþe þaim haf þai tan; [Þai] war þe floure of þar men?he. Þan in schort tyme men mycht se Þaim passe, and seisse in to þar hande Þe landis þai befor þaim fande. Þe neþir ende of Cliddisdaile Is cummyn to þe pesse al haile; Off Ranfrew al þe baronny Coyme to þar pesse ful wilfully. Schir Gotheray þe Rose was þan In Cwnyngame, and Inglis ma?

On hym richt smertly can þai ga, And qwhat for luf, and qwhat for aw, To Scottis pesse þai can hym draw; Swa þat in til a lit qwhille Carrik, Cwnyngame and Kylle Wiþe gret payne [þai haue] wonnynge þen, And worthit al gud Scottis men.

Þe Erl of Murrawe þan herde say How þe northe cuntre ay Þe Erl Dawy was sterande, And occupyide al þe lande. He gadryt hym a companny, And þiddyr helde his waye in hy. His men in hi sa til hym rasse, Þat þe Erl of Athol was Off na powar withe hym to feycht; Þarfor he eschewit his mycht, And wiþe drew hym al til warande, And he in al tyme was folowande. Til Louchqwhabyr he helde [his] way, And þe toþir hym folowyt ay, And led hym til swylk distres, Þat at sa gret myscheyf he was, Þat his knychtis weryt rewelynys Off hidis, of hertys hemmynys, And hym behuffit cum Scottis man; A gret athe þar to swoyr he þan. Aqwhil þan helde þai companny; Þar left he syne þe Erl Dawy For to maynteyn weil þat cuntre, And qwhil he Scottis was sa did he; And he his waye in Lowthean Wiþe his men?he his gate has tane. Gud Wil?ame þat tyme of Dowglasse Cummyne hayme of Inglande was, And gaderit hym a companny. The Wemyss ms. resumes here.

Sa did gud Alexander Ramsay, That euer wes wicht in hard assay, And Lowrens alsua of Prestoun, That prisit wes of hie renovne; Haliburtoun, Hering alsua, And vthire worthy wichtmen ma, Held þaim euer to Scottis fay. Mony gud iuperdy did þai. CHAPTER CLXV. How King Eduard of Ingland Slew his avne broþer wiþ his hand. In till þis tyme þe mychti King Off Ingland with his gadering Toward Sanct Iohnestoun held his way; And sone eftir, as I herd say, Iohne of Eltane followit in hy, And in Lesmahago can ly, And on þe morne brynt þat abbay. This gud did he quhare he lay; Syne went he towart Perth but let. And quhen þe king his broþer met, Thare fell þai in to sic carping, That athire ?arnit to be king Off Scotland, and þare wiþ a knyf The king has reft his broþer his lif. Lo, þare wes vengeance tane perfay Off þe birnyng of þat abbay, And þare wes baith ressoun and skill; For quha till halykirk dois ill, Suld neuer to do weill haif wenyng, Bot gif þai cum till amending. The King of Ingland als fast Hame on till his avne land past. And in þe samyn tyme þat þis wes, The Erll Iohne did besynes, Baith be land and als be se, To saif þe richt of þe cuntre; For at þe Talbait he wes quhilis, Haldand dais wiþ Iohne of þe Ilis, That wes to Inglis fay haldand; And quhill he wes in þe mayne land, Travaland sa besely That men callit him vtraly The best begynnyng of a man, That in Scotland wes wonnand þan. Sa fell it at þe Erll of Gillyre To help þe King of Ingland fure With his powere throu Lowthiane, And toward Edinburgh has tane The way; bot all þe Scottismen That in Louthiane were þen Assemblit to þe Erll Iohne: Gud William of Dowglass wes one, Alexander Ramsay and Prestoun, And oþer feill of gret renovne. Thai met þaim on þe Borow Mure, And sa rycht rudly wiþ þaim fure That to þe toune þai tuke þar way. In at þe Frere Wynd enterit þai, And to þe Crag vp throu þe tovne Thai held full fast in a randoun. The castell þat tyme wes nocht maid; Wp hie apon þe Crag þai baid, And of þare horss þai slew mony, And maid þaim forowth þaim to ly, In steid of wall to covir þaim þare, For þai were fast assal?eit þare. Thare baid þai all þat nycht till day; Bot in sa gret distres were þai Off thryst þat þai þe dew wald lik, Quhare at þai saw it fallin thik. Thai tretit on þe morne at day For gret sovme of gold to pay, Sa þat þai all fre mycht be To pass hame in þar avne cuntre, And at þe Scottismen suld convay [Thaim] to þe Merche þe hie way Rycht till Ingland, and þar þaim leif. Forþi þis Erll Iohne of Murreif, And William of Dowglas, þai twa Can wiþ a sympill powere ga Till Ingland þaim to convay. Sa met þai þan in to þar way With Peris of Pariss, þat had tane A pray, and syne hamewart wes gane; With him þai facht, bot for a man Apon þe Scottis half cryit þan, “Allace! oure men has tane þe flycht,” Thai lukit behind þaim, as þai mycht, And saw feill of þar fallowis ga; And þai, that saw þaim fleand swa, Tuke all þe flicht, and gaif þe bak. A wickit word may sumquhile mak Full gret tinsall, as it did here; For men trowit traistly, but weire, Had nocht þat wickit word bene þen, The feild had gane wiþ þe Scottismen. The Erll of Murray þare wes tane, And Iames of Dowglass þar wes slane; Bot William his broþer of Dowglass Eschapit þare throu Goddis grace. In þis tyme Schir Andro of Murraif Come hame, and a gret ransoun gaif; And sone þe Scottismen in hy Ordanit a counsall at Dersy. The Erll Davy come þidder þan, That ?it þan had bene Scottisman; Bot þe etlyng of his cummyng wes Till haif slane William of Dowglass, That of his purposs gat wittering, And eschapit throu freyndis helping. Schire Andro of Murraif þan agane Wes with þaim all chosin wardane. Thai partit, and to Louthiane Schire Andro and Dowglass baiþ ar gane. Bot þe Erll of Athall Davy, Fra he persauit þat opinly He mycht nocht fordo þe Dowglass, His hert fra Scottis haill turnyt was, And become Inglisman agane, And gert his men wiþ all þar mayne Ryot halely þe cuntre, And leit at all his avne suld be. Dunbar be þat wes biggit weill; And quhen þe Erll had his castell Stalwart, he stuffit it in hy, And become Scottisman fullely. In Ingland þan þai maid a raid With all þe few folkis at þai had, And come agane all haill and feyre, And sa enforsit þare powere. CHAPTER CLXVI. How a knycht Schir Thomas of Roslyne Wes slane at Abirdene þat tyme. Now ga we to þe Erll Davy, That semblit till him gret cumpany, And raid rudely oure all þe land Sum quhile, men said, with thre thousand; And sa till assege Kindrummy He schupe him with his men stoutly. Thare Dame Cristiane þe Bruss wiþin, That thocht to lat him in to wyn, Maid stout and manly resistens, And wichtly set for hir defens, And oftare chasit þaim without Than þai did þaim within, but dout. That tyme of Roslyne Schir Thomas, That throu all Ingland haldin was Ane of þe best knychtis of hand, That men wist in till ony land, To Dunotyre he come be se; Thare William Mowbray met and he, With all þe folkis at þan had þai, Till Abirdene syne held þar way, That till haif fundin void of men Thai wend; bot it wes nocht swa þen; For weill neire at the Granys end Thai met wiþ weill ma þan þai wend. And þare þan, at þar first meting, Richt at a litill burne passing Schire Thomas hurt wes in þe kne, And of þat hurt þare deit he. Thai cryit of Roslyne; bot he can say: “Roslyne is went, tak yov Mowbray.” Sa fell as þai were fechtand þare, The Scottismen fast till erd þaim baire, And followit fast syne on þe chace; Bot þai þat behind followand wes, As þai ouretuke, ay þai baire doune The Scottis þat followit to þe tovne Slaand; and sa baith þai ware Wencust; bot Scottis þe war had þare, Outtane þe slauchter of Roslyne. His corss with þaim þai tursit syne, And held to Dunottir agane; Bot of þar folkis ?it left þai slane. CHAPTER CLXVII. How þe Erll Davy of Athale Wes slane fechtand þan in batall. Qwhen Schir Andro Murraif herd How rude þe Erll Davy ferd With his men, he wes angry, And thocht to raiss þat segis in hy. Than in haist all þaim gaderit he That wes south half þe Scottis Se, That he mycht get of armyt men. The Erll Patrik come till him þen, And alsua Ramsay and Prestoun, And oþer seire of gret renovne. William of Dowglass als wes þare With his gud men, at worthy ware, And oþer feill, till þai were þen Weill aucht hunder of fechtand men. The floure of þe south half þe Scottis Se At þat tyme in his rout had he. Than raid þai on þar way fast, Till þai þe Month had saufly past. The erll herd of þar cummyn weill, And departit fra þe castell; Till Kilbleyne straucht þe way tuke he, And herbryit him and his men?e At þe est end, rycht in þe way. And evin befor þaim, quhare þai lay, At þe Hall of Logy Rothwayne Schire Andro has his herbry tane. And till him come fra Kindromy Thre hundreth wicht men and hardy, That comfort him in mekle thing; For he wes glaid of þar cummyng. Sa in his cumpany wes ane, Callit Iohne of Crag, þat had bene tane With þe erll, and suld his ransoun pay Apone þe morne, at wes his day. He said to þe lordis in prevete, Gif þai wald trow his counsall, he Suld throu þe wod a redy way Enviroun quhare þare fais lay, And behind bring þaim all weill neire, Or þai oucht of þar cummyng suld heire. And he fulfillit all þat he hecht; For sone eftir þe mydnycht He gert þe Scottismen prevely Ryss, and mak þaim boune in hy. To Dee he led þaim, and þare þai Fand in þe wod a redy way. That way þai held, quhill at þai ware Passit þar fais a myle or mare. Endlang þe wod wes wayis twa: The erll in þe vmast lay of þai; The Scottismen held þe nethir way; Syne corsit oure till it perfay. Thare horss þai left behind ilkane, And to þar fais on fut ar gane, That of þar come wist nakyn thing. Bot sone eftir in þe dawing Thare scowerouris of þaim gat a sicht, That, with all hy þat euer þai mycht, Warnyt þe erll, and he in hy Gert trump, to warne his cumpany; And þai till him assemblit sone. In to schort tyme sa haif þai done That at a litill peth wes þare Thai assemblit withoutin ware. Evin in þe peth wes Erll Davy, And till a gret stane, lay him by, He said: “Be Goddis fais, we twa Sall fle elike, I vndirta.” William of Dowglass, þat had þen The waward wiþ þe wichtest men That were in all þat cumpany, Quhen at he saw þe Erll Davy Standand with his men arrayit swa, His spere in baith his handis can ta, And kest it oure thwort and can say: “Standis, lordingis, astound;” and þai That were in till his cumpany Murmurit þarof prevely. And quhen Erll Davy saw at þai Stude sa, in hy he brak array, And cryit lowd: “Apon þaim tyte, For þai are all neire discomfite.” Than till a furde doune can he ga; And quhen Dowglass saw him do swa, He said: “Now we”; and, but mare let, Thai strekit speris and samyn met Richt in þe furd. Robert Braid E, A hardy knycht, þare gert þai de. Amang þaim gret dyntis þai gaif. With þat Schir Andro of Murraif Come in on syde sa sturdely With all þaim of his cumpany That in his cummyng, as þai say, He baire doune buskis in his way. Fra he assemblit þar baid nane; The commonis all þe flicht has tane. Thare by ane aik deit Erll Davy, And feill als of his cumpany; Schire Walter Cummyn wes þare slane; Schire Thomas Broune in handis wes tane, And syne wes hedit hastely; It semyt þai luffit him nocht gretly. Schir Robert Men?eis to Canmor Went, quhare he wonnand wes befor. Thidder he went, and in a peill He gouernyt him and his men?e weill. And syne apon þe toþer day He tretit, and come to þar fay. Thare wes bot few slane in that fycht, For þe wod held þaim out of sicht; And sa fled als sa hastely That away gat þe mast party. This fecht apon Sanct Androis day, Or on his evin fell, as þai say. And of þis fechting þat þare was Off Arsildone spak quhilum Thomas, And said þus mystely in derne, Thare sulde mete stythly stark and sterne. Thus spak he as in prophacy; Bot how he wist it wes ferly. The erll wes þusgatis done of day; And sone eftir William Mowbray Tretit, and come to þare pess, And to richt weill resauit wes; For he wes waill wycht at deviss, And of richt gud counsall and wiss. The wardane þan tuke furþ his way To Dundarge; þare þe Bewmond lay, That had maid vp þe castell þen, And stuffit it with meit and men. The wardane þidder is went syne, And þidder gert cary ane engyne. And þat Schir William þe Mowbray, That ?arnyt to be at assay, With oþer wycht went to þe ?et. The Inglis ischit to mak debate At þar barras, and fon?eit fast; Bot thai were drevin at þe last. The wardane gert þe gunnare syne Dress vp stoutly þe engyne, And warpit at þe toure a stane. The first cast at it kest, bot ane, It hit þe toure a sturdy straik, That þe mast gest of þe toure brak. The Bewmond tretit þaim in hy, To sauf him and his cumpany, And ?auld þe toure to þe wardane, And went him on in Ingland hame. Quheþer he went be land or se, I can nocht tell þe certante. CHAPTER CLXVIII. How King Edward of Windissore Come to revenge him wiþ gret schore. A thousand and iii?. ?ere And xxxvi. to þai clere, Thus wes þe Bewmond put away. Than at þar pess haly had þai Vpon north half þe Month haly. Than were þai in to gud party To do weill, quhen sa mekle land Wes all togidder in þar hand. That tyme þe Erll [wyfe] Davy, With oþer ladyis, þat were lufly, In Loghindorbe wes þan liand. And quhen þe King of Ingland Herd þat sa were þai ladyis Envyround wiþ þar innemyis, He schupe him to reskew þaim þen With xx. thousand chosin men. He held his way wiþ þat men?e, And sone he past þe Scottis Se; Evin to Perth he tuke þe way. Schire Andro Murraif [þan] lay In to þe wod of Strankalater, With all þe folk þat with him were. That to þe King Eduard wes tald; Tharefor evin till him can he hald, And come sa neire him in þat thraw That þare discouerouris oþer saw, And sum of þaim iustit of weire. Schire Andro in Strankalater At þe mess wes standand þen; Bot þar wes nane of all his men, That wes in till his rout þat day, That anys a word durst him say Till he wes herand mess, for he Suld at þaim displesit be. Forthy þai maid þaim boune, and baid Till he all þe mess herd had; And þan þai tald till him how neire The king and all his gret ost were. Quod he: “Na haist”; þe quheþer perfay His folkis wald fayne haif bene away; For þe gret oste wes þan sa neire That sum bot schort way fra þaim were. His horss till him þai brocht in hy; Thai wald he had bene one lichtly. Bot, as he drest him his horss to ta, His cuschas lan?are brak in twa. Than wald he nocht out of þat place, Bot for all þe haist at þar wes; A smale cofyre he gert bring þare, A royne lan?hare þarof to scheire, And schare a thwayng at all laysere, And þarwith festnyt vp his geire. I herd seire worthy knychtis say That þaim thocht neuer in all þar day Sa rycht anoyus abyding, As þaim thocht in þat thwayng schering. He lap on, and in gud array He held his folkis, and past his way. And quhen þe Inglis ost can se In sik array all his men?e, Forthy þai wald nocht brek array, Bot followit him in haill batall ay Sa fast at þai had bene ourtane, Na ware at þai had wiþ þaim ane That kennyt þaim þarby a way, That doune betuix twa craggis lay. Throu þat strait rod, as I deviss, Thai gat weill fra þar innemyis, And lessit noþer man nor lad. And quhen þe king saw þat he had Tynt on þat wiss, he wes wa, And northwartis agane can he ga, Till he to Blaire come, and thare lay. Syne tuke to Loghindorb þe way, And þare þe ladyis has wiþ him tane. Til Abirdene syne is he gane, And in till vengeance of Roslyne The toune vp haly brint þai syne. And syne to Perth þe way tuke he, And gert it stythly wallit be. Edinburgh, Roxburgh, and Striuelyne He maid vp, and set keparis syne. Schire Thomas Oughter þe worthy Had Perth to keip, and the Rukby Wes kepare in to Striuelyne maid; Edinburgh Iohne of Striuilyne had; Roxburgh had William of Feltoun, That to Scottismen wes ay felloun. Quhen all þis, as I say, wes done, In till Ingland he went him sone. And for Erll Patrik, as him thocht, All his cunnandis held him nocht, That gert him vp his castell ma, And syne turnyt sa sone him fra; The Muntagw behind left he, That wes a lord of gret degre, With oþer lordis and knychtis fell, To byde and assege þat castell. Bot gud Dame Agnes of Dunbar, With þe gudmen þat with hir ware, Defendit it full douchtely, As I sall tell ?ow hastely. CHAPTER CLXIX. Off þe assegeing of Dunbare, And of Dame Annes wiss and ware. Schire William Montagw, þat sa Had tane þe assege, in hy gert ma A mekle and a stalwart gyne, And gert dress it vp smertly syne, And warpit at þe wall gret stanis, Baith hard and hevy for þe nanis; Bot þat na merring to þaim maid. And quhen þat þai ay castin had, With a towell a damyceill, Arrayit iolely and weill, Wypit þe wall, at þai mycht se, To gere þaim mare anoyit be. Than at þat [sege] weill lang þai lay, Bot small avantage þan had þai; For, quhen þai bekkire wald or assaill, Thai tynt þe mast of þar travale. And as þai bikkerit þare a day, Off a schot I sall ?ow say, That mony had of it ferly; Tharfor it now reherss will I. Will of Spenss persit a bla?one, And throu thre fald a habireione, And ane attoun throu thre ply, And þe arow throu þe body, Till of þe dynt doune deid he lay. And þan þe Muntagw can say: “This is ane of my ladyis pynnis; Hir amouris to my hert þus rynnis.” And till þe segis lestit on þis wiss, Men sais þar fell seire iuperdyis. For Lowrens of Prestoun, at þen Wes haldin ane of þe wichtest men That wes in all Scotland þat tyde, A rout of Inglismen saw ryde, That semyt gud men and douchty, And were arrayit iolely; He, with feware þan þai ware, Assemblit stoutly on þaim þare. Bot at þe assembling he wes there In till þe movth strekin wiþ a spere, Quhill it vp to his harnys ran. Vnto a dyke he drew him þan, And deit, for na mare lif he mocht. His [men] his dede persauit nocht, Bot with þar fais faucht sa fast Till þai þaim vencust at þe last. Thus wes þat gud man brocht till end, That wes rycht gretly to commend Off gret worschip and hie bounte. His saull be euer in angell gle. Schire William of Keith of Galstoun, A knycht prisit of hie renovne, Met Richart Talbot by þe way, And put him to sa hard assay That till a kirk he gert him ga, And closs him thare defens to ma. Bot he assal?eit þare sa fast That him worthit trete at þe last, And for twa thousand pundis to pay He left ostage and went his way. This passit nocht attour thre ?ere Sen þe Ballioll and his folkis were Aryvit first within Scotland; And I haif herd folkis oft sayand That all þe Inglis lordis were In till Scottismenis dangere Within þai thre ?ere all, outtane Schire Rauf of Stanfurd him allane, And þe Baliole, at gat away At Anand, as ?e herd perfay. Me think þis wes a wonder thing That gret batallis and fechting Couth nocht cum to sic end, as quhone With iuperdyiss oftsyss has done. The Montagw wes ?it lyand Segeand Dunbar with stalwart hand; Thare twa galais of Gyone had he For till assege it by þe se. And as he þus assegyand lay, He wes set in a gret affray; For he had purchest him cowyne With ane of þaim þat wes within, That he suld leif opin þe ?et, And þarto certane tyme he set To cum; bot þai within haly Were warnyt of it prevely. He come, and þe ?et opin fand, And wald haif gane in fut stepand; Bot Iohne of Covpland, þat wes þan Bot a rycht pure sympill man, Schot him abak, and in is gane. The port culis come doune on ane, And sparit þe Montagw þarout. ?it þai within set vp a schout, And cryit on hycht, and said þus: “Quhow! Fairewele; we haif þe Montagw!” “Nay,” quod Covpland, “be my hand, Bot pure Iohne of Covpland.” Than Montagew went his men till, And leit him self begylit ill. Syne Alexander þe Ramsay, At wend in his entent at þai That were assegiit in Dunbar At gret distress or mischeif ware, In till ane evinnyng fra þe Bass Bot with a few þat with him was, Fast to Dunbare in till a bait He held all prevely his gait; And by þe galais full slely He gat in with his cumpany. The lady, and all þat were þare, Off his come weill comfort were. He yschit in þe mornyng airely, And with þe wache sturdely He maid a pert and stout melle, And syne but tinsall enterit he. Till þe Montagw wes þar lyand, The King Eduard of Ingland Purchest him help and allyance To mufe his weire rycht þan in France, And for þe Montagw he send; For he couth bring na thing till end Foroutin him, for þat tyme he Wes mast of his counsall preve. And þan, at þe kingis bidding, He remuffit but mare byding, Quhen he, I trow, had lyne þare A qwarter of a ?ere and mare. It wes to Scotland a gud chance, That he set him to werray France; For he had halely him tane To werray Scotland him allane, Eftir þe gret mischeiffis twa, Duplyne and Halydoun were þai, Thai suld haif scathit it gretly. Bot fortoune, þocht scho fald sickerly, Will nocht at anys all mischeiffis fall. Forthy scho set þare [hartis] all To verray France, þat Scottis mycht be Beleft þus in to gretare lee. Off þis ilk sege in [hething] The Inglismen maid oft carping: “I wow to God, scho beris hir weill, The Scottis wenche with hir ploddeill; For cum I airly, cum I lait, I fynd ay Annes at þe ?ait. CHAPTER CLXX. How Schir Andro of Murray wardane Put out all Inglismen agane. Schire Andro syne, þe gud wardane, That wiþ all powere can him pane For to recouere agane þe land, That Inglismen had in þar hand, To Fyfe he went with his gadering, And þare sone at þe begynnyng He wan þe castell of Anderstoun, And to þe erd gert cast it doune. The Peyll of Lughyris syne he wan, And all þe pelis þat were þan In Fyfe, outtakyn Covper allane. Wes nane vnwonnyng bot þat ane, That Schir Andro Bullo stoutly Held þan with gret cumpany. Alexander þe Ramsay there With a squyare iustit of weire, And him throu out þe body baire. And quhen þe wardane had bene þaire Till him likit, and of þat land Had wonnyn gret part till his hand, He tuke his way þan to Boithuile, And lay assegyand it a quhile, And brocht a gyne þai callit Bostoure For till assal?e þat stalwart toure. Thare Stevin Wissman, a gud squiere, Apone þe Scottis syde slane wes there; And Gilmyn de Willeris, þat þan Held þat toure as worthy man, Saw his wittalis were neire gane, And syne hope of reskew had nane, Tretit, and syne þe castell ?ald; His way till Ingland fast can hald. Schire Andro syne wiþ stalwart hand Maid sindry radis in Ingland, And brynt and slew, and did gret scaþ, And richit his men and his land baith. Syne eftir mony dedis worthy, That he did in his wardanery, Till Awagh in to Ross went he Till eiss him in his avne cuntre. And þare him tuke a fell seiknes, That sa felloun and angry wes, And him disesit sa ferly fast, That þe dede followit at þe last. Thare maid þat noble knycht his end, Bot nocht in armes, as he wend; To end in armes etlyt he, And quhare worschip mycht provit be. And in þe kirk of Rosmarkyn That noble knycht wes beryit syne. Bot of our land sum cornykle sais That þis gud knycht in his last dais Assegit þe castell of Sterlyne With gret powere; bot he herd syne That þe King Edward of Ingland Wes cumand on wiþ stalwart hand, And sa of forss, as him behuffit, Fra þat sege he him remuffit. Schire William of Keith ?it neuerþeles With his awne speire slane þar wes. As he him pressit vp to þe wall, On his avne speire he tuke a fall; Thare deit þat gud knycht reklesly Throu suddand case and vnhappy. And eftir þan, quhen þat wes done, Schire Andro þan, but langere hone, Eftir þe Mychaelmes past of weire Till Edinburgh wiþ his powere, And lang about þe castell lay; And to þe King of Scotlandis fay Off Lowþiane tuke mony men. Fra þat [assege] he passit þen, For he persauit þat he mycht, Nouþer be powere nor be slicht, Wyn þat castell, as it wes þan Stuffit wiþ wittall and wiþ men; And he persauit als fraudfull slicht Off Scottismen, and þe gret mycht Off þe King alsua of Ingland Cumand on him wiþ stalwart hand. Forþi of forss, as him behuffit, Fra þat assege he him remuffit, Als he persauit a gret seiknes That growand on him þat tyme wes. Oure þe Month þan passit he Till Awagh in his awne cuntre, And þare þan endit he his dais, As forouth þis þe cornikle sais. He wes a man of gret bounte, Off sober lif and chastite, Wertuouss and wiss of counsall, And of gudis full liberall, And a man of gret deuotioun, Off prayere and of orisoun, And of full mekle almuss deid, Stout and hardy of manheid. Bot twa ?eris and ane half certane Wes he of Scotland haill wardane; And north on to þe Scottis Se To þe Scottis fay brocht he All þe Scottis natioun, And all þe castellis kest he doune. In gret distress þe commonis ware Pynit, and deit with hungyre saire; For with his ost, quhare he ourraid, Gret suppriss in þe cuntre he maid. And þat of fyne forss þan behuffit To be, for sa his purposs muffit To draw þe kinrik in fredome, That Inglismen held in thraldome; For less þan sa on na wiss he Mycht draw in fredome his cuntre. CHAPTER CLXXI. How þe gud Erll of Darby Iustit at Berwik of were manly. A thousand and iii?. ?ere And xxxviii. to þai clere, Schire Andro of Murray þusgatis deid, Wardane þan chosin in his steid The Stewart Robert wes of Scotland. Oure King Davy þan beand In to þe Castell Galyart, His sister sone þis ?oung Robert Be þe estatis euerilkane Off Scotland þan wes maid wardane; And he mantenyt it mare and mare, As I sall tell ?ow forþirmare. In þis tyme William of Dowglass In þe forest travelland wes, And wan it all, and maid it his, Magre all his innemyss. That tyme þe Montagw wes gane In France, and in till Burgone tane, And of Loncaschire Schire Henry, That Erll callit wes of Darby, And eftir King syne of Ingland, Henry þe Ferd þar regnand, Than with his king he wes preve. On Scotland merche þan travaland he, And had gret ?arnyng to wyn priss For he [wes] worthy, wycht and wiss, And mast renovnit of bounte, Off gentrice and of honeste; And all þai þat in Ingland wes He herd speke mekle of þe Dowglass, That did mony gud iuperdy Throu wit and manheid opinly. He send and askit thre courss of weire, And Dowglass grantit it but dangere. Thai come eftir to certane place; Alexander þe Ramsay þare was Servand Dowglass at þat iusting, For he expart wes in sic thing. This noble Erll þan of Derby Come with a ryall cumpany; And fra þai had þar halsing maid, Thai tuke þar renkis, and samyn raid; And at þe toþer courss of weire The Dowglass hit, and brak his speire; And a skylyss of þe schaft, þat brak, In till his hand a wound can mak. Tharfor þis gud Erll of Darby, That saw him hurt sa velanusly, Wald thole him iust as þan na mare. Bot, or he tuke his leif to faire, He spak till Alexander Ramsay, And specially he can him pray For to purchess him cumpany, That suld be at þe lest twenty Off gentill men wiþ scheld and speire, To iust ilk man thre courss of weire; And gif he mycht nocht get all gentilmen, He bad him tak knawin ?emen þen, And cum to Berwik a set day. And þarto grantit þe Ramsay, And said him þat he suld purchas Cumpany, and cum to þat place, With þi þat þai assouerit ware, Quhare euer fell at þat iusting were thare. The erll assouerit þaim sekerly; And þan þe Ramsay in gret hy Gat him fallowis, and at þe day To Berwik come baith he and þai. The erll resauit þaim honorably, And gert deliuer þaim gud herbery. Wpon þe morne, quhen at þai ware Makand þaim bovne, þe erll come þare, And fand all opin þe entre; And nocht forþi ?it knokit he Outwith þe dure all prevely, Till Ramsay come till him in hy, And gert him entir sone; and he Said: “God mot at ?our laising be.” Syne said he: “Lordis, on quhat manere Will ?e ryne at þis iusting heire?” “With vplasit scheildis,” said Ramsay, “As it efferis to þis play.” “A! schiris, be oure Lord,” said he, “Sa suld here na man prysit be, For nane to oþer mycht do ill; Bot and it likand were ?ow till, As men vsis oftsyss to ryne, Sa may he priss and worschip wyn.” Than said Alexander þe Ramsay: “It sall like till ws all perfay, That ilk man ryne his fallow till In kirtill allane, gif þat ?e will.” Than said þe erll agane meikly: “Nay, þat were all to hard trewly.” Quod William of þe Touris þan: “Sen ?e will sa, lat ilk man Ryne wiþ a baire visage, and ?e Quha first eschewis sone sall se.” The erll said meikly: “Schiris, nay, ?it is þat all to hard, I say; Bot as I said ?ow, will ?e do? Than sall sum priss follow þarto.” Thare to þai gaif all þar assent, And he furþ sa till his folkis went. This iusting lestit dais thre, Quhare men rycht pert coursis mycht se. Twa Inglis knychtis þare wes slane; Off Scottismen þare deit nane. Bot turnand hamewartis be þe way Off a hurt deit Iohne þe Hay; And William þe Ramsay þare of weire Wes borne throu þe helme with a speire, And throu þe heid throu strenth of hand Till þe trunscheoun left þar stekand. Thai brocht a preist till him belif, And in his helme he can him schrif. Than said þis gud Erll of Derby: “Lo! heire a faire sicht sickerly. A fayrere sycht how may men se, Than knycht, or squyare, quheþer þai be, In to his helme him for to schrif? Quhen I sall pass out of þis lif, I wald God of his grace wald send Me on þis manere for till end.” Quhen he had schrevin him, as I say, Than Alexander the Ramsay Gert lay him doune but langere let, And on his helme his fut he set, And with gret strenth out can arass The trunschone þat þare stykand was. He stert vp sone, quhen it wes out, And with a gud cher and a stout He said at him alit na thing. Thareof þe erll had gret wondering, And gretly him commendit þen, And said: “Lo! stout hertis of men!” Thus happinnit till him of his lame. And a gud knycht Patrik þe Grahame, That had travalit be?ond þe se Till eik his priss and his bounte, Herd speke of his iusting gretly, And sped him þidder in gret hy, And come þare on þe toþer day. Than Richart Talbot can him pray To serue him of thre courss of were, And he him grantit but dangere. Sone eftir samyn can þai ryne; The Talbot on had platis twyn, And throu þaim baith his speire he baire, And in þe breist ane insche and mare. Had he iustit as cunnand wes, He had bene dede in to þat place. Off þare coursis þai ran na ma, Na nane had mare harme of þai twa. Bot þe Talbot can him requere To be with him at þe suppere. He assentit, and quhen þai were Sittand best at þe suppere, Thare salust þaim a cumly knycht, That semyt stout, bald and wycht. Amang þaim all sittand þare, At Schir Patrik thre courss of were He askit him for cumpany, And he, as bourdand, said smethly: “Man, will þov haif of me iusting? Ryss vp to morne in þe mornyng, And heir þi mess weill, and schrif þe; And þov sall weill deliuerit be.” Thareof he maid him na gabing; For on þe morne at þe iusting He baire him throu þe body quyte, And he deit of þe dynt full tyte. This wes apon þe thrid day. And quhen iustit ilk ane had þai, The harrotis þan vpon þar wiss That did weill þare were gevin þe priss, On baith þe halfis to wyn þaim meid, That baire þaim best, eftir þar gud deid. The lordis gaif assent þartill, And ordanit wiþ þar alleris will That Inglis suld þe Scottis priss, And þai þaim on þe samyn wiss. The Inglismen þe priss gaif þan Till ane þat thre haill courss ran Foroutin hurt; bot Scottis men Avisit þaim all samyn þen, And till þe knycht þe priss gaif þai That smat William þe Ramsay Throu out þe heid, and be þis skill Thai schew it till enforss þar will: Thai said it wes iusting of were, And he, þat mast ingreffit þere, Suld haif þe gretest price, with þi That he engreiffit honestly. Than said þe harraldis halely The dome wes suthfast and worthy; “Bot ?it,” quod ane, “methink perfay That he þat a knycht ?isterday Slew, and ane oþer to day, þe priss Suld haif, Schir Patrik Grame þat is; For had þe Talbot, as tal?eit was, Iustit, he had deit in þat place. As to þis price gevin, forthy I hald him deid all vtraly.” On þis wiss spak þat herrot þare; Bot for þe price wes gevin are, Thai wald repell it be na way. And þan þe noble erll can say: “I trow it hes bene seildin sene That iusting of weire þus hes bene Continewit thre dais, and þe priss Gevin, as I now trow, on þis wiss.” He festit þe iustaris þat day That on þe morne [þan] went þar way. CHAPTER CLXXII. Off gud Schir William of Dowglass That at þe Gallorodheid slane was. The iusting þusgatis endit is, And aþer part went hame, I wiss. That tyme þe land wes all of were, And in vnrest, as it wes ere; The ?oung men, þat were in þe land, Thare priss were alwayis purchessand, And quhilis tuke, and quhilis wer tane; For vre of weire is nocht ay ane. Amang þaim William of Dowglass Full besely travelland was. For þe fredome of þe land He tuke rycht hard thingis on hand. Mony faire iuperdy him fell, That, quha sa couþ, were gud to tell; Bot for I can thame tell planely, ?it sum of þaim reherss sall I. At þe Blak Solling wiþ þe Lord Berclay He wes set in till hard assay; Bot for þai facht in to þe nycht, And aþer fal?eit fast of sicht, On baith þe halfis fled þar men. Bot Dowglass nere þe were had þen: Thare baid nocht wiþ him attour thre; Tharfor his folk wend slane were he. And at þe Cragis by Cragy syne He faucht wiþ Schir Iohne of Striuelyne, That of Edinburcht wes capitane, And tuke him wiþ mekle pane, For þai defendit þaim stoutly; Bot þai were vincust forþi. At Kirkton Dene, as I herd tell, Ane hard poyn?e of weire him fell; For þai were on þe lest party Ane hundreth armyt iolely Off knychtis and squieris, but rangall. On horsbak happinnit þat batall. The Inglis ost lay nere þarby; Bot neuerþeles full hardely William of Dowglass wiþ his rout Schot on þaim scharply wiþ a schout, And iustit of weire full pertly. Thare Dowglass wes strikin throu þe body; Bot he liffit eftir in gud heill. Sa couth he with his fais deill That þai were rudly put agane, And of þare folk a few were slane; Bot for þare gret ost wes nereby, Dowglass withdrew him wittely. Syne at þe Blak Solling þai say That he wes set in hard assay; For he wes few, and Inglismen Sexty armyt come on him þen On horss prekand deliuerly. Had he nocht fundin in mare hy Ane awantage, he had bene dede; Bot þare wes neire him in þat steid A deip syke, and on fut wes he; Thare oure he stert wiþ his men?e, And baid syne at þe sykis bra. The Inglis, als hard as horss mycht ga, Come on þe syke, and has nocht sene, Bot wend at all plane feild had bene. Forþi at þe assembling þai In þe syke to þe gyrthis lay; And þe Scottismen in þare lichting Maid þaim þare sa hard welcummyng That þai were slane ilkane, or tane. Off all þat rout eschapit nane. Apone a ?ule evin alsua Wittale, at to þe king suld ga Off Ingland, þat in Melross lay, He met rycht stoutly in þe way; And apone all þat cumpany, That convoyit þame, he schot in hy, And vencust þaim wiþ hard bargane, And had þe wittalis with him agane. The carll wiþ þe myttane, þai say, Baire him richt weill at þat assay; Prysit richt hely he was. Syne eftir þis William of Dowglas Off þe Hermytage þe castell wan, That Inglismen occupiit þan; And stuffit wes wiþ men and mete, And gud keparis in it he set. Syne quhare Rolland þe Waus wes slane, And all his rout wiþ stark bargane, Dowglass wiþ þe ourehand come hame, Baith haill and feire, wiþoutin lame. Schire Lourens als of Abirnethy, That wes a stout knycht and a hardy, Vencust Dowglass five tymes a day; Bot he sa thra of fechting wes ay Than lang or evin he has him tane, And discomfit his men ilkane. Sa he, þat wes aboue all day, Or evin wes set in sic assay That he wes presoner till him maid, That he all day defoulit had. Hereby may men ensampill ta, How men þare avne fortoune may ma: For thranes, with a steidfast thocht To thole anoyes, quhasa mocht, May oftsyss vnlikly thing Richt weill to þar purposs bring. Sa did it heire to þis William, That left nocht for defoull na lame, Bot followit his purposs sa ythandly, Till he had his entent planely. Than wes he weill lang travelland In sindry placis in þat land, Quhare of were fell him poyntis seire, That I can nocht reherss all heire. Syne passit he prevely To Castell Gal?eard to King Davy, And perfurnyst his erandis þare; Syne hamewartis schupe he him to faire. CHAPTER CLXXIII. Off þe segeing of Sanct Iohnestoun And how it won wes and dong doune. A thousand thre hundreth xxx. and nyne Fra lichtare wes þe suete Virgyne, The Stewart þan of Scotland Wes, as I said ?ow, luftennand Throu out all Scotland to þe king. He maid a generall gadering Off all þat euer mycht wappinnis weild, Or worthy ware to fecht in feild; For he with all forss maid him boune For till assege Sanct Iohnestoun. The Erll William of Ross come þare, With noble men þat worthy ware; Erll Patrik als is þidder gane With mony gud men of Louthiane; Moriss of Murray, þat Cliddisdaill Had þare in his leding haill, Schire William of Keth of þe Galstoun, With mony oþer of hie renovne. In þis tyme William of Dowglass Out of France hame cummyn was; And with him Franche squyeris twa He brocht hame, and þe tane of þai Was hattyne Galeos de la Hewis, The toþer wes hattin Iohne þe Bruyss. In Cowperis Castell ?it þan was Schire William; bot þe Douglas Sa tretit him þat he it ?ald, And maid syne aith þarto till hald The Scottis fay in all his lif. Syne come baith to þe sege belif; Than all þe lordis þat were þare Off his hame come recomfort ware. And, for Dowglas wes douchty man, The wargit has lugit þan In þe South Inche; and Erll Patrik, And þe mast part of þe kinrik, Were als in þat South Inche lyand. The Erll of Ross on þe toþer hand At þe Blak Freris had his herbery, With him a gret stout cumpany. And, or þe toune sa assegeit was, William had purchest of Dowglas A sturdy revere on þe se, Hew Pyle, and five schippis had he, To ly in to þe wattir of Tay, That nane Inglis suld þare away For to beire tythandis in Ingland, Na ?it bring wittalis of þat land. A lang tyme at þe sege þai lay. The Scottis held mercat ilka day, And wittaill come in gret foisoun. Quhill þai were lyand at þat toune, Thare wes ofttymes bikkering, Quhare þare wes fell and neire schuting. Thare throu þar deit twa Scottis squieris, As þai were gouernand þar archeris, Allane Boid and Iohne of Striuelyne. William of Dowglas wes syne Schot wiþ a springald throu þe the; Bot neuer þe quheþer ?it þan he Contenit him full manfully Ay till þe sege þare couþ ly. And Dauid þe Berclay, þat wes þan Within þe toune as Inglisman, Askit of Iohne þe Bruss iusting Off weire, and he without gruching Deliuerit him of coursis thre. Faire haill iustyng þare men mycht se Bot of þaim hurt wes nane, þai say. And in þe tyme þat þai þus lay, A gret eclipss wes of þe sone; Forthy fele folk, þat wes nocht wone, Abaisit of þat sicht þan ware, To se sic want as þai saw þare. Bot had þai knawin þe courss all, That gerris sic eclipss fall, Thai suld haif had nane abaising. For eclipsis is nane oþer thing Bot quhen þe mone, at rynnis neire Till ws þan dois þe sone be fer, And hapnis evin to cum betuene Oure sicht and þe sone so schene, Than lettis ws þe sone to se In till als mekle quantite, As it passis betuix oure sicht, And þe sone it lettis ws of licht. For þe sone is all tyme but weire In þe self baith brycht and cleire. Till þai þus at þe sege couþ ly, The Erll of Ross, þat wes witty, Gert get him sle mynouris, and syne Vndir þe erd he gert þaim myne, And stall þar wattir away haly, Till all þar dykis were left dry. And quhen þai of þe toune has sene Thare wattir stollin away sa clene, And wes þe mast defend þai had, Than gret abaising it þaim maid. Schire Thomas Wghter, a gud man, That wardane of þe toune wes þan, Saw his fais sa about him ly, And saw him stad als sa straitly That all his wittalis were neire gane, And hope of reskew had he nane. Than with oure wardane tretit he, For to sauf his commonalte; He ?ald þe toune vp in his hand, And set him fre within Ingland, And all his þat were in þat place. And quhen þis thing affermyt was, The wardane resauit þe toune, And dang þar mudwall dykis doune; And all sic strenth, as thai had, Evin laigh wiþ þe erd þai maid; And syne gert haif þis Schir Thomas Till Ingland, as þar cunnand was. About Perth þan wes þe cuntre Sa waist at wonder wes to se; For all a weill fere space þarby Wes nouþer houss left, nor herbery. Off deire þan þare wes sic fusioun That þai wald neire cum to þe toune. Sa gret a hungire wes neire þat steid That mony folkis for falt were deid. [Thai] said als þat a carll þarby Wald mak nettis and set quayntly Childer and woman for to ta, And cum þan on þaim, and þaim sla, And eit þaim all, þat he get mycht. Criste Cleke to name he hecht. That laithfull lif lang hantit he, Quhill waist but folkis wes þe cuntre. The wardane syne fra Perth is gane To Striuelyne wiþ his oste on ane, That castell till assege suthly, That þan Schir Thomas of Rukby Held wiþ oþer worthy men, That of houshald were wiþ him þen. Thare till a sege set þe wardane; Bot þe Erll of Ross wes went hame, And þai, þat at þat segis þan lay, Bekyrit oþer euerilk day. At ane assault, at þai þare maid, William of Keth, þat ?arnyng had To pruf to clym attour þe wall, Enarmyt in his harnes all Wes clymmand vpwart; bot a stane, That come fra hicht, has him ourtane, That twafald doune it can him beire, And stekit him on his awne spere; Off þat hurt þare deit he, And of his dede it wes pete; For he wes waill, wycht and hardy, And fulfillit of chevalry. Sa lang þare segeand þan þai lay, Till þai within, as I herd say, Fal?eit sa halely þe meit That þai had na thing for till eit. And quhen Rukby saw it wes sa, That fortoune forsit hir to be his fa, And þat sa straitly stad he was That him worthit to ?eild þe place, He tretit, and it ?ald he, To set him in till Ingland fre. The wardane has þat castell tane, And saw it wycht of lyme and stane, And set als in sa strait a place That of þe self rycht wicht it was. He and his counsall haly thocht To cast it doune þat þai wald nocht; Tharfor to Morris of Murraif In keping he þat castell gaif, And syne he strenthit it gretly, For he wes waill, riche and mychti. The wardane þan till his cuntre Went, and a quhile him restit he, And quhile he raid throu out þe land; For þan þe kinrik wes growand Baith in riches and honeste, Off corne and catell gret plente. And of þe kinrik þe mast party Were liege men sworne to King Davy. Bot Edinburgh and Roxburcht alsua Were haldin ?it stoutly þaim fra; Berwik, Iedworth, and Lowmabane, Off all þir thre ?it had þai nane; Tewidaill and oþer landis seire At Inglis fay ?it haldin were. The laif alhaill were Scottis men, That liffit sumquhat at liking þen. The quheþer þe iuperdyis of weire Fell oftsyss, as þai did eire, Bot all þai tymes commonly The best fell to þe Scottis party. CHAPTER CLXXIV. How Edinburgh Castell wonnyng wes Throu Walter of Towryis wiss purches. A thousand and thre hundreth gane, And fourty ?eris and þarto ane, Worthy William of Dowglass In till his hert rycht angry was, That Edinburgh Castell swa Wrocht þe cuntre mekle wa, Standand in þe hert of oure land, And sa lang in our fais hand. He thocht to cast a iuperdyis, And tretit with Walter of Towrys, That of Edinburgh wes a burges, And aldirman of it þat tyme wes. He purwayit a schip at Dunde, And hardy men þarin did he; William Fresall wes ane of þai, And ?oachim of Kynbuk alsua, And William Bullo, þat wes þan The King of Scotlandis suorne man, And mony oþer gud men alsua, That wicht and worthy were wiþ þai, That fen?eit þaim to be merchans, That þidder were cummyn on þar chance Out of Ingland wiþ quheit and wyne, And with oþer sindry thingis syne. Till Inchekeith þai come in hys, And gert þis ilk Watter of Towrys Pass to þe castell, and þare say That merchiandis of Ingland were þai, That had maid þidder þare travale With wyne, and walx, and oþer wittale; And, for his manteinyng, Thai wald send him in þe mornyng A presand of wittale and wyne; And, wald he by mare, he suld syne At his will, gif he wald, by; And at þe maister wald airly Cum, and a part of his schipmen, To speke wiþ him; and he bad þen Lat þaim cum hardely him till, For þai suld enter at þar will. He bad þe portar sone þat he Suld mak redy þe entre; And he said at he suld do sa. Than Watter has tane his leif to ga, That sped had wonder weill his neid. Doune to þe schip in hy he ?eid, And tald þaim all how he had done. Syne to þe Dowglass send he sone, That in þe waillis nere by Enbuschit him þat nycht prevely. The schipmen sone in þe mornyng Tursit on twa horss þar flitting; And ane of þaim tuke crelis baire, That coverit weill wiþ clathis ware; The toþer bare barellis ferreyis twa Full of watter, þat gert þai ga Forouth, and þai xii. all followand, Ilkman a gud burdoun in hand, And roid frogis on thare armyng, To heill þaim with for persauing; And all þar berdis schawyne ware. Watter of Towrys wes with þaim þare, That squyarit þaim vpwart þe gait, And ?eid befor þaim to þe ?ate, And said to þe portar: “Þir ar þai, The capitane spak of ?isterday; Opin þe ?et onone,” said he. Him had bene better haif lattin it be. The mekle ?et he opnit þan, And he, þat nixt wes till him, ran, And laid him to þe erd in hys. A staff þan tuke Watter of Towrys, And set vnder þe port culiss, That it mycht cum doune on na wiss. And syne baith crelis and colis with all Vpon þe turnepike leit he fall; And þan ane blew a horne in hy. Than in þe castell raiss þe scry; The folk fast sped þaim to þe ?ate; Bot þai fand stout portaris þarat, That þaim recounterit sturdely. Thai faucht a quhile rycht cruelly, Ay till at William of Douglas, That in þe waillis enbuschit was, Herd þe gret noyis and þe cry. Than to þe castell hastely He sped him, and quhen he come þare, He fand þaim fechtand, less and mare; Bot he þat bargane stancheit sone, And in schort tyme sa has he done, That he þe castell all has tane, And wan þe castellwartis ilkane. And sum he tuke, and sum he slew, And sum slaid doune oure crag and hew. The ?ettis gert he keip wysly. Thai of þe toune come in gret hy, And become Scottismen full swith, For of þat wynnyng þai were blith. CHAPTER CLXXV. Off þe gud Alexander Ramsay That pruffit weill at hard assay. Qwhen Dowglas duelt a quhile þare had, Off þat castell kepare he maid William eldare of Dowglass, That wes his broþer of purchas; Syne to þe Forest went his way. He wes in besy travale ay To help his land on mony wiss, And to fordo his innemyss. Than Alexander þe Ramsay, With oþer dochty at assay, In to þe Coffe of Hawthorndene A wycht resset had maid þaim þen. He had a ioly cumpany Off wycht ?oung men, and rycht hardy. He wes sa prisit of hie bounte With all men in to þe cuntre, That na ?oung man þan in þe land, That traistit oucht in his avne hand, That trowit þat he mycht prisit be, Bot gif a quhile wiþ him were he. He did mony gud iuperdy, And with him ay in cumpany Wes Halyburtoun, and Hering, That were baith stout, bald and ?ing, Patrik of Dunbar, and Dischingtoun, And vthire feill of hie renovne. Sa fell a tyme at he and þai, And oþer seire of gret noblay, Past, and heryit in Ingland, And maid all þairis þat euer þai fand. Thai tuke prayis and presoneris, And oþer gudis on seire maneris, Till þar handis sa fillit ware That þai as þan wald tak na mare. The castellwartis on þe Marche herd say How in þar land lyand were þai; And gaderit þaim togidder þen All þat þai mycht be of men, Off castellis and of þe cuntre, And schupe þaim forouth þaim to be. And þai with presoneris and prayis Hamewartis straucht held on þar wayis; And sone þai saw þe Inglis rout, That semyt stalwart men and stout, And were all out fer ma þan þai. Than till his feris said Ramsay: “Fallowis, we mon in to þis ficht Wyrk wiþ avissment and slicht. ?e se weill þai ar ma þan we; Bot þarfor nane abaisit be. We will ws fen?e as we wald fle, And withdraw ws a litill we. And quhen þai se ws schape away, Bot dout þai sall sone brek array, And þan richt on horss bak sall we Schute on þaim, or þai knyt be.” As he deuisit þai haif done; And, quhen þai suld haif semblit sone, Ramsay and his cumpany Schupe to withdraw þaim hastely. The Inglismen þan cryit on hie: “Wpone þe Scottis; þai fle, þai fle.” Than for to tell the taill schortly, Ramsay with all his cumpany Set in þe heid apon þaim þare, For out of array haill þai ware; Sa þat þai were discomfit sone, And fled and scalit wiþoutin hone. The Scottismen followit on þe chace, And tuke gud presoneris in þat place. Thare wes tane Schir Robert Maneris, And oþer sindry gret squyeris; Schire William Heroun wiþ a straik In to þe cheke his way can tak. A few in to þe fechting place Wes slane, and ma[n]glit ill þar wes; Bot in þe fecht and in þe chas A gret men?e takin was, And Ramsay wiþ þe oure hand Come haime vnhurt in to his land. The King of France þat tyme gaif For þe Erll Iohne of Murraif Schire William Montagw frely, That þan wes Erll of Salisbery, And a lord of gret pouste. Me think all Scottismen suld be Gretly haldin to þat king, That þare king, quhen he wes ?ing, And set als in sa gret distres That put out of his awne land wes, [He] resauit him worthely, And gouernyt richt reuerently, And als of his debonarte For þe Erll of Murray he Gaif þe Montagw frely. Crist resaif his saull forthy. And quhen þe Erll cummyn hame þus was, To þe wardane þe way he tais, For he wes till him neire cousing. With him he wes a quhile, and syne He went his way till Anandirdaill, That wes his awne heretage haill. Bot for þat Schir William þe Bovne, That þan wes Erll of Northhamptoun, Held þe castell of Lochmabane, And all þe land had till him tane, As gevin him of þe Inglis king, He fand þare felloune ganestanding. Bot neuerþeles ?it þare baid he, And wes oft in perplexite; Bot magre his, I tak on hand, He tuke þe malis of þat land All till his avne vss halely, Bot it were ony small brybry That neire þe castell wes lyand, Bot he gat all þe remanand. The myddill Marche kepit Dowglass, That oftsyss in þe Forest was, And abandonyt weill þe land Mast part to þe Scottismenis hand. In Ingland als ryde oft wald he, And rychit him and his men?e. And at þe Est Marche Ramsay Did mony iuperdy perfay; And in all þis tyme þire thre Preist þaim ay nixt þe Marche to be. For all þe laif þan of þe land Wes in to riches haboundand; And all þe inwart of þe kinrik Wes in gud quyet, rest and plyte, And gret foysoun of alkin gud; The kinrik þan in gud way stude. Than thocht þe lordis of þe land That it wes gud to tak on hand To send eftir þare King Davy, That wonnand wes in Normundy, Syne þe mast forss of his land Wes wonnyng out of his fais hand. Thai send him word þan oure þe se; And sone eftir him bownyt he, And at þe King of France has tane His leif, and to þe se is gane, And with twa schippis prevely He aryvit at Inuerbervy, And [Quene] Iohne als wiþ him brocht he. Than blith wes all his commonalte, And resauit him with all blithnes. Weill waxin þat tyme he wes, And thowles als, for his ?outhheid Thare to his nature couþ him leid. Iustyng, dansing and playing He hantit mekle, for he wes ?ing; And sa with playis him solissand He raid wiþ a faire court throu his land. In all þis tyme Schir William Bell, At chosin wes, as ?e herd tell, Eftir þat Iames Ben wes dede, Till haif bene bischop in his steid Off Sanctandrois se vakand, Wes in þe court of Rome bydand. Bot neuerþeles ?it, as he thocht, The bischoprik optenit he nocht; For blynd of baith his ene wes he. Sa ix. ?eris vakand wes þat se. Than William Landalis, quhen þis fell, That tyme wes persone of Kynkell, And wes in France a ?oung clerk þan, And of lynage a gret gentillman; He set him for þis bischoprik, That wakit sa lang in oure kinrik. His freyndis muffit þe King of France To mak for him speciall instance In his letteres to þe pape, To mak þis Master William bischap Off Sanct Androis se vakand. Oure King Davy of Scotland Wes ?it þan in Normundy, And wrait to þe paip specially For þis William, at he mycht be Promuffit to þis vakand se. Bot ?it baid it furþ still vakand As it wes lang befor beand, Ay quhyll at þe chapiter Maid gret instance and prayere Till þe xii. Benet þan Pape To mak þis Master William bischap At þare instance, becauss þat se Vakit to lang in þare cuntre, And sa þe kirk in to þat quhile Stude þarthrou oft in gret perile Off scaith, expenss and disess, Quhill þat it sa vakand wes; Na in till a vacatioun Thai wald nocht mak electioun Twiss, for þai trowit þat ware To þe law sumdeill contrare. To þe pape þai wrait forþi All þe mare effectuously. The pape resauit þar letre? weill, And sped þar instance ilk deill; And sa þai gert þis Landellis be Promuffit to þis lang vacand se. And þat thing to be clerely wittin, To baith þe kingis þe pape hes writtin, That be þe speciall thra prayere Off all Sanctandrois chapitere Off Rome þe Twelft Benet Pape William Landalis mais bischape. Than wes he bischop passit oure In his tyme xl. ?eris and foure, As of his ending ?e may heire Eftir þis mare of þis matere. CHAPTER CLXXVI. How gud Alexander þe Ramsay Wan Roxburgh Castell on Pasche Day. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere And xlii. þare to cleire, Richt airely on a Pasche day Alexander þe Ramsay Throu preve convoying of ane, That hattyn wes Hude of Edname, Come to Roxburght, quhen it wes myrk, And þare his men sa can wirk That with ledderis his men?e all, Throu help of Hude, clam our þe wall. Doune fra þe wall þan ar þai gane, And with forss has þe castell tane, Magre þaim all þat stude agane. Sum þai tuke, and sum has slane, And sesit all þe gudis þai fand. Feltone wes þan in to Ingland; Forthy he eschapit þe deid. And quhen Ramsay had maid þat steid Bowand till his will alhaill, The mast part þan of Tewidaill Come to þe King Davyis fay; And he maid Alexander Ramsay Off all Tewidaill his schiraif, And Roxburght in keping him gaif. Syne raid he thryss wiþ stalwart hand Attour þe Marche in Ingland. And first he raid on closs manere Wndir þe Erll of Murreiffis banere, And brynt Penreth; and þarwithall Off Ross he brynt þe ryall hall. Sone eftir þat he maid of weire Ane oþer raid wiþ plane banere. Thare new knychtis, þat he had maid, For to wyne þar schone furþ raid With a richt sturdy cumpany, Quhare Robert of Ogill wes neireby With a gret rout; and quhen he saw Thai knychtis cum stoutly but aw, He him withdrew, for he wes wiss, And scharp of weire at all deviss. He withdrew him till a myre qwaw, That lyand wes weill neire a schaw. Thir knychtis, that saw his withdrawing, Followit ay fast on in a ling, And prekit sa fast out of array, Till of þare men in þat myre lay, Sa þat þare levit nocht fifty Togidder in all þat cumpany. Than Ogill turnyt, and abaid; And þai in hy vpon him raid, And iustit richt pertly of weire. A felloune bargane maid þai þare. On baith þe halffis slane were men; Bot oure knychtis þe ware had þen, For þare folkis vencust were ilkane, And v. knychtis in handis were tane, Stewart, Eglyngtoun, and Cragy, Boid, and Foulartoun trewly; Ogill had þaim till his presoun, And syne were frethit for ransoun. The king but mare harme hame is went. Sone eftir þat fell a mawtelent Betuix Dowglass and þe Ramsay, That ay woxe mare, till on a day Dowglass him waitit as he raid Till Hawik, quhare he ordanit had To hald a court; þare of his men The mast part to þe toune went þen, And to þe kirk þe way tuke he Bot with a few of his men?e. And þare come on him þe Dowglass, That of þat deid weill purvait was, And tuke him þare throu fell fechting, And woundit him in þe taking. And to þe Hermytage als fast With him bundin þan þai past; And in presoune þare deit he. Off his dede wes gret pete. To tell ?ow þarof þe manere, It is bot dolour for to heire. He wes þe gretest menyt man That ony creature think on can Off his estait, or mare be fer; For all him menyt, better and were, And riche and pure him menyt baith, For of his dede it wes gret scaith. Bot dule mycht mak nane amending As of his deid, and quhen þe king Herd how he wes dede away, Till a stout man Iohne þe Berclay He gaif þe keping of þe castell Off Roxburght, and he it kepit weill. And neuerþeles þe King Davy Tuke in till hert rycht hevely Ramsais dede, at slane wes sa; Forthy he pressit him to sla This ilk William of Dowglas, [That] warely him withdrawin has, Ay till þe Stewart of Scotland, That mast till help him tuke on hand, Prayit for him sa ythandly, That þare þe king his malancoly Forgaif him, and tuke him till his grace. Off Roxburght syne he schiref was, And tuke þe castell in keping. In Ingland syne past þe king Off were, and þare gret hereschip maid; Bot, to say suth, þan at þat raid Nane aventure of fechting fell, That men suld þarof gretly tell; Bot, but tinsall, his men and he Come hame agane to þar cuntre. CHAPTER CLXXVI. The chapter number appears thus in the ms. Off þe batall of Durhame And how þe King Davy wes tane. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere And xlvi. þareto cleire, The King of France set him to raiss The sege lyand about Calaiss, And wrait in Scotland till our king, And maid him richt speciall praying That he wald werray in Ingland; For, he said, he suld tak on hand On his syde for to werray; And sa on baith þe halfis þai Suld be hard set. Þan King Davy, That wes stout, ?oung, and ioly, And ?arnyt for to se fechting, Grantit to fulfill his ?arnyng, And gaderit all his ost bedene. He mycht full weill content haif bene That he had bene in Ingland thriss Off were vpon his innemyiss, And nane þai tymes tuke on hand To pass agane in till his land. Quhy couþ he nocht haif bene in pess, And reullit his land in richtiusnes, And haldin him self out of dangere? Quha standis weill, he suld nocht steire. Bot for he saw weill þat Fortoune Sa fairely with his folk had done, That throu wynnyng of iupertyis Scho had hieyit on sic a wiss, That þai had wonnyng all his land, He wend weill scho wald stably stand; Bot þat is nocht of kynd hir law. Oure King Davy couþ nocht þat knaw. Quha will of Fortoune vndirstand, Hir law is ay to be muffand; Fals scho ware, gif scho suld be Ay standand steidfast in a gre. Blamyt scho suld nocht be forþi Off tressoun or of trechory, For to ouretirf þat is abuf, Sen nature makis hir sa to mufe, Quhile giffand gret thingis, and quhile small, To gere fullis trow þat scho sall Ay fermly in þat fredome lest. Bot quhen þai traist hir all þire best, All þat is gevin be þat lady, Scho ourtirffis all sodanely. Off oure folkis rycht sa befell, As I but tarying sall ?ow tell. Quhat wes þar mare? Our King Davy Gaderit his ost alhalely; And with þaim of þe north cuntre To Sanct Iohnestoun cummyn is he. Ranald of þe Ylis þan, That haldin wes a worthy man, Come till him out of his cuntre, With him at þat raid to be. The Erll of Ross wes þare alsua, That to þis Ranald wes heid fa; Tharfor he gert him þare aspy, And in till Elghow þat nunry, Quhare Ranald had tane herbery þen, He slew him out and his sevin men; And to Ross with his gret men?e Agane in hy þan turnyt he. This Ranald menyt wes gretly, For he wes gudman and worthy. And fra þai saw þis mysfortoune, Syne can in þare hertis schone, And said it wes rycht euill takenyng, That in þe first of þar stering That worthy man suld be slane sa, And sa gret routtis scaill þaim fra. And þus amangis þaim murmurit þai; ?it þan þe king held furþ his way, And for þat tinsale wald nocht let To do it at he on wes set. He passit sone þe Scottis Se, And to þe Marche sa him sped he, Quhare at þe peill of Liddalisdaill His oste till him assemblit haill; Tharein wes Walter of Fesby Vpon þe Inglismenis party. That peill þai assal?eit, and it wan, And all þat euer were in it þan, Outtakin childer and women, Foroutin mercy þai slew þen. Thai slew þaim all oure cruelly; Forthy þe pane followit trewly. Than counsalit þaim William of Dowglas, That of weris mast wesy was, To turne agane in þare cuntre; For þai mycht with þare honeste Turne agane, he said, richt weill, Sen þai had wone of forss þat peill. Bot oþer gret men, þat were by, Said þat he had fillit fully His baggis, and þairis all twme ware; And said at þai mycht richt weill faire To Lundone, for in Ingland þen Off mycht þare wes leiffit na men, Bot sowtaris, skinnaris and merchans. For, þai said, all were farne in Frans. The Dowglas mycht nocht þare be herd. Furþ on þar way þis folk þan ferd, And in þe Abbay of Exhame All þe ost þai gert þar name, And in till all þar ost þai fand Off armyt men bot twa thousand; And þat wes all to few to fecht Agane of Ingland þe gret mycht. Fra þat abbay þai past syne Evin to Durehame in a lyne, And in þe park weill neire þarby Thai lugeit þaim, and tuke herbery. Than had þai bene in Ingland Weill xiiii. dais travelland, Bot þai couþ get na wittering Off Ingliss menis gadering; The quheþer þai assemblit were In till a park beside þaim neire, Fra Trent northwartis all þe floure Off folkis, þat oucht were of valoure. The Archbischop of ?ork wes þare, The Lord Persy, and wiþ þaim ware The Lord Feres, and þe Rukby, And þe Lord alsua de Lucy, And þe Lord Newill ?it wiþ þai, Ogill, Heroun, and mony ma, That I can nocht reherss ?ow heire. Off archeris als assemblit were Xx. thousand, þat rollit ware, But men of armes, bald as baire, That were all out fer ma þan þai. The Scottismen, þat in þe park lay, Wist na thing of þare gadering, Bot maid þaim myrth and solasing. William of Dowglass, þat þan was Ordanit in forray for to pass, Held on airely in þe mornyng With þe mast part of þar gadering. Evin to þe park he held his way Quhare þat his fais in haill ost lay; And þai, þat bovne were weill airely, With þare batallis all sodanely At þe fery of þe hill þaim met. Oure forreouris þare hard wes set; And, for þai were nocht of na mycht, In to gret hy þai tuke þe flicht. And [þai] egirly eftir þaim raid, And sa gret slauchtir of þaim maid That, quhat þare and at Sondyrsand, Five hundreth deit throu dynt of hand. Dowglass eschapit fra þe chass. Oure ost þan all effrayit was; Bot nocht forthy þe douchty men Thare oste stoutly arrayit þen, And delt þaim in to batallis thre: The king himself in ane wes he, And to þe Erll Iohne of Murraif And Douglas als þe toþer he gaif; The Stewart had þe toþer batall, That wes þe mast be mekle daill Than ony batall þat wes þare; For mony gud men wiþ him ware. And quhill þai were arrayand, The Inglis archeris come sa neirehand That schute amang þaim weill mycht þai. Than gud Schir Iohne þe Grahame can say To þe king: “Gettis me, but ma, Ane hundreth on horss wiþ me to ga, And all ?one archearis scaill sall I; Sa sall we fecht mare sekirly.” Thus spak he, bot he mycht get nane. His horss in hy þan has he tane, And him allane amangis þaim raid, And rowme rudly about him maid. Quhen he a quhile had prekit þare, And feill of þaim had gert sow saire, He to þe batallis raid agane; Sa fell it at his horss wes slane. The Erll of Murray and his men?e Wes neire þan at þe assemble; At hie dykis assemblit þai, And þat brak haly þare array. Forthy were þai discomfit sone, And held þar way withoutin hone To þe king, þat assemblit was In till a rycht anoyus place, That nane, but hurt, mycht lift his hand, Quhen þai þar fais mycht nocht ganestand. To þe Stewartis rout went þai, That wes assemblit by þe way, Quhare þai had rovme to stand and fycht; Thare mycht þai stand to pruf þar mycht. Than baith þe first routtis rycht þare At þat assemble vincust ware. For of arowis sic schot þare was That feill were woundit in þat place. Thare wes fell fechting; as men sais, Sic wes nane sene befor þai dais, Nane fellare certis þan wes þare. For quhen þe flearis twa myle and mare Were fled, þe baneris were still standand, Face to face still fechtand With all þar fors; bot nocht forthy ?it were þai vencust halely; And mony fled, at neuer agane Turnyt, and mony als wes slane. This fell on þe Sanct Lukis evin, That þis batall wes strikin and gevin. Thare Iohne of Covpland tuke þe king Off forss, nocht ?oldin in taking; The king twa teith out of his heid With a dynt of his knyf he revid. In þat fecht slane wes erllis twa, Off Murray and Stratherne were þai; And foure were takin to presoun, Off Fife þe first, and syne Wigtoun, Menteth syne, and Sothirland; Thir foure erllis were tane in hand. Five hundreth slane wes, as say þai, But þai þat deit in þe forray; And sa in all þat slane were þare Till a thousand reknyt ware. Than Schir William of Dowglass Takin in þat fechting was; Bot þe Stewart eschapit þen, And with him mony of his men, And þe Erl of þe Marche alsua; Hame to Scotland come þai twa. And quhen þis batall þus wes done, Eftir þat within schort space sone Tasse Lorane, þat kepit þan Roxburght Castell, come Inglisman, And gaif it to þe Lord Persy; Than turnyt till Inglis fay mony. Baith of Tevidaill and Tweddaill, Off Ettrik Forest, and þe Merss haill, Ananderdaill, Nyddisdaill, and Galloway, All þir landis to þaim drew þai. At Cowbrandispeth and at Soltra That tyme þai can þe marchis ma; At Carlynlippis and at Corstryne Thare þai maid þe marchis syne. Bot of Carrik Iohne Kennedy Warrayit Galloway sturdely; Allane Stewart and he, þai twa, Did þaim of Galloway mekle wa; Bot ?it þe Balliole all þat quhile Wes wonnand still at þe Brint Ile; ?it wes þare mony Scottismen That held stoutly þar boundis þen. Bot þe felloun snybbis þai had Maid þar hertis to be rad, Sa þat þai durst nocht tak on hand Agane þe gret routtis to fecht or stand. The Balliole syne and þe Persy, With mony folkis in cumpany, Past on weire throu Louthiane, And sa to þe Fawkirk ar gane; To Glasgw syne þai held þar way, And out throu Cunynghame held þai, And sa furþ to þe toune of Aire; And syne throu Nyddisdaill can þai faire Hamewartis to þar avne cuntre. Bot ?it þai left of þar men?e Syndry þat slane were in seire placis. That raid nocht gretly scaithand was To þe cuntre þat þai throu raid; For þai na gret forrayis maid. The Stewart of Scotland þan agane Wes chosin vp, and maid wardane, And he maid schireffis and bal?eis, And oþer officiaris on seire wiss. Than Edinburgh Castell he gaif In keping to William of Murraif, That wes stouttare þan myster was; And þarfor a gret riot raiss Betuix him and men of þe cuntre. At Dirltoun eftir þat deit he; And þan wes Edinburgh Castaill And þe toune gevin alhaill To Schir Dauid þe Lindsay, That worthy wes and leill of fay; And nouþer with þe toune, na ?it cuntre, Na riot in his tyme maid he. CHAPTER CLXXVII. How þe were fell throu Wyntoun For þe ?oung lady of Cetoun. A thousand thre hundreth fourty and sevin Eftir þe birth of God of Hevin, Quhen William of Murray wes liffand In Edinburgh Castell, it kepand, That ilk ?ere Allane of Wyntoun Tuke þe ?oung lady of Cetoun, And weddit hir þan till his wif, And for þat wedding fell gret strif. This William of Murraif wes alhaill In Wyntonis help and suppowall. Wyntonis Weire men vsit [all] That gret ryot for to call; For in Louthiane, as men said, Ma þan ane hundreth plewis it laid. ?it gat þis Wyntoun on þat lady Twa faire childer and lufly: A sone, þat wes callit Williame, And a dochter Margaret be name. And eftir at all þis wes done, He passit out of Scotland sone. Sa fell it at be?ond þe se In þe Halyland deit he. That ilk ?ere a gret pestilens, But ony oþer violens, Fell on cokkis and hennis baith, Sa þat men vandit for scaith For to eit sic volatill, That deit sa, for gret perill. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere And xlviii. þarto cleire, In þat tyme William of Dowglass, That Schir Archibaldis sone was That wes gud Iames of Dowglass broþer, (He gat þis William, and ane oþer That hecht Iohne, eldare þan he, Bot þat deit be?ond þe se,) This William come to Douglassdaill, And tuke till him þat land vp haill. Till Edinburght syne he tuke þe way To gud Schir Davy þe Lindesay, That kepit þan Edinburght Castell, And him resauit wonder weill. And þarin wiþ him a gret quhile lay For his eme wes þis Schir Davy. Syne, quhen a tyme wes passit by, The castell in his gouernyng He tuke, and maid in it duelling. [Than], quhat throu help of þe burges, And þe custum at þat tyme wes, In his hand he wox mychty, And gat him a gud cumpany; And to þe Forest syne past he, And playit him þare with his men?e. The folkis alhaill come to þe fay Off Scotland, for him faworit þai. Sa to þe pess he brocht þat land. The quheþer ?it Iohne of Covpland Wes in to Roxburght neire him by, That at þis thing wes rycht angry; Bot þocht he wes of wickit will, ?it mycht he set na let þartill. Syne, quhen a tyme wes passit, he Gaderit him a gret men?e Off his frendis and his avne men, And towart Tevidaill held he þen, Quhare all þe folk of Tewydaill Were aganis him gaderit haill, And stoutly stude with all þar mycht Aganis him purvaid to fecht. Thai maid haill countynance of fechting; Bot quhen þai come to þe sembling, Foroutin dynt þai gaif þe bak, And schupe na mare bargane to mak; And in þe chass rycht mony þare Were takin, and mony eschapit are. Than in þat land sa lang lay he That þe mast forss of þe cuntre, To sauf þar gudis, come him till, And [put] þaim haly in his will. He tuke þaim to þe Scottis fay; Till him þe aith þare þan maid þai. CHAPTER CLXXVIII. How messingeris come out of France To bynd and afferme þe allyance. A thousand thre hundreth fourty and nyne Fra lichtare wes þe suete Virgyne, In Scotland þe first pestilens Begouth, of sa gret violens That it wes said of liffand men The thrid part it distroyit þen; And eftir þat in to Scotland A ?ere or mare it wes wedand. Befor þat tyme wes neuer sene In Scotland pestilens sa keyne: For men, and barnis, and wemen, It sparit nocht for to quell then. A thousand iii?. fifty and five ?eris fra borne wes God of live, A knycht, callit Schir Ewyn of Gunseyris, With sexty knychtis and squieris, Famouss men of gret bounte, Arrayit weill in all degre, Come chargeit fra þe King of France To ferme and bynd þe allyance Betuix ws and þe Franche men, That lang wes bunding befor þen. Thai said þai wald at þar powere Wes to continew furþ þe weire Betuix þaim and þe Inglismen, And said þai wald we did sua then. Off gold þai brocht in till our land Off muttownys fourty full thousand, And ilk muttone of gold ware At foure schillingis, and na mare. The King of France þat to þaim sent To gare þaim pruf mare hardyment; And sa þai did withoutin weire; Thai put þaim self to perellis seire Him for to pleiss, and to wyne priss. Quha giffis sic giftis he is wiss. He gaif wisly his gift, for he, Throu his wit and his largite, And þai giftis wiþ faire sembland, Thare hertis hardy till him band. Thomas Stewart þat ilk ?ere, Erll of Anguss, throu counsall clere Off þe Erll Patrik, on a nycht Past to Berwik wiþ gret mycht, And but persaving prevely. Neire þe Kow ?et manlely Thare ledderis to þe wall þai set, And pressit þaim oure þe wall to get. William of Towris first vp is gane. Thare Robert of Ogill sone wes slane. As þai wan vp, syne eftir þai Held doune vnto þe toune þar way, And tuke vp gudis and presoneris. Bot most forss of þar aduerseris To þe castell throu Wallas Toure Held þare wayis to get succour. Scottismen wes all þat nycht sprethand, And maid all þairis þat euer þai fand; Quhare throu mony ane richare are, At pure and sympill forouth ware. And quhen þe marchearis herd þis tythand, Thai semblit sone to Iohne of Coupland, That tuke þe King Davy at Durehame, And on þe Marche had mekle name. He thocht þat he with all þat mycht Suld to þe castell cum be nycht Throu Wallace Toure, sa to þe toune, And sa put to confusioun The Scottismen þat þarin ware, That wes weill warnyt of þar feire, And richt stoutly can assaill That toure, þat þai with gret travale At þe last wan it manfully, And stuffit it rycht weill in hy. Thare þis Ewyn the Gransayeris With his knychtis and his squieris, Off Frans þat were send fra þe king, Pruffit gret price at þat fechting. To Berwik come þe wardane syne, And stuffit it wiþ men and armyne, And with wittalis it for to hald, Magre quhasa assal?e wald. CHAPTER CLXXIX. How þe Ballioll gaif vp his rycht To þe King Edward of mycht. Qwhen to þe King Edward wes tald How Scottismen schupe þaim till hald Berwik, he assemblit in hy All his powere halely, Till he had foure score of thousand, And schup him, baith be se and land, Till [sege] þat toune, till he it wyn. Bot þe few folkis þat were þarin, Quhen þai þaim baith be land and se Saw vmbeset with sic men?e, And wist at þai mycht it nocht hald, Tretit first, and syne it þaim ?ald, And held þar way to þare cuntre. Syne wiþ his ryall powere he Till Edinburght held on his way, And þare a litill tyme he lay, Bydand his schippis wiþ wittall. Bot a gret storme sa gert þaim scaill That þai were drevin haill away. Quhare þai aryvit I can nocht say. And quhen þe king saw þat wittale In þat cuntre can him faill, To Roxburght in hy held he. And þare, forouth all his men?e, The Ballioll gaif him all his richt At he had þan, or ?it haif mycht, As to þe kinrik of Scotland, And prayit him fast to tak on hand To venge him on þe Scottismen, That he callit ill and felloun then. The king resauit his gift þat day, And syne als fast held on his way Till Ingland with all his men?e. And þe Ballioll wiþ him had he, That all his tyme in Ingland lay, And saw neuer Scotland fra þat day. The Lord Dowglas, fra he wes went, That set allway his entent For till anoy þe Inglismen, A trayne richt slely maid he þen Till a stout knycht Schir Thomas Gray, That in till Norhame Castell lay, And of þat castell wes capitane. Sa slely has he maid þat trayne That he ischit out sturdely, And had in till his cumpany Foure score or ma of armyt men, For outin other archearis þen. With all þat rout he held his way Neire by quhare in a buschement lay The Lord Dowglass wiþ his men?e. The Erll Patrik wiþ him had he, And Schir Ewyn, we spak of aire. And quhen þar fais neire þaim ware, Thai brak þar buschement sodanely, And schot apon þaim hardely. And quhen þis stout knycht Schir Thomas Saw þe baner of Dowglass, And Erll Patrikis baid with all, He gert till him his sone þan call, William be name, and maid him knycht. Syne said he: “Fallowis, we mon fycht; Forthy beis of gud comfort all; Lat nane repruf quhat euer befall. To fecht is mensk and schame to fle; Ilk man help oþer in neid,” quod he; And with þat word assemblit þai. Sum held on fute, sum at erd lay, Quhat dyntis þai gaif, I can nocht tell; Bot at þe last sa it befell That Schir Thomas in handis wes tane, And weill neire all his men ilkane. Dowglass went hame wiþ þe ourhand, Thare presoneris wiþ þaim ledand, Quhare throu mony men rychit ware Throu presoneris at þai tuke þare. Twa gud squyaris, forsuth I hecht, On þe Scottis syde deit in þat fecht: The tane hecht Iohne of Haliburtoun, A gud squyare of gret renovne; Iames Turnbull þe toþer was. To Paradiss þar saulis mot pass. CHAPTER CLXXX. Off a fechting that wes tane then Betuix þe Franche and Inglismen. In till þis tyme þat I of tell Ane aduenture in France befell, That for þe douchtynes of þe dede Is worthy baith to write and reid. All [tuich it] nocht to þis matere, Me think it speidfull to writt heire, That men of armes may reioysing Haif, quhen it cummys to þar hering. In Less Brettane be?ond þe se Thare fell of weire a saire poyn?e Betuix Franche and Inglissmen, And set at Inglis ma were þen Than were Franche, ?it all þar rout Were discomfit in fecht all out. The Lord of Bewmaner in þe fecht Throu manheid tuke ane Inglis knycht, That leit of Franchemen richt lichtly, And oft wald say dispitously: “Quhat, are nocht Inglis douchtyest þen? That God wald sleip in till his den, ?it think me and I were to ta Ane Inglisman is worþ of Franche twa.” Thus spak he oft, till on a day This Lord Bewmaner can him say: “Thou spekis, schir, all to largely; Men may fynd perchance nere hand by Men of als mekle bounte As þov may fynd in þi degre.” The knycht said: “Schir, be my gud fay, That wald I fayne were at assay, Quhare we mycht fecht wiþ evin men?e, And ane of þaim þare wald I be.” Bewmaner þan amovit was, And said him: “Þov may fynd perchas Thy fill of fechting, gif þov dar.” “?e, wald God,” sayd he, “gif I were þare.” “Bew schir,” sais Bewmaner, “perfay, Sen þov wald fane be at assay, ?it sall I mak þe þis cunnand. Thow sall pass hame in Ingland, And of þe best men of þe cuntre Chess ay till ?e xxx. be, And I sall chess me als mony Off kyn and freyndis heire me by, And set we heire a certane place To mete; and gif God giffis me grace To haue wittour with my men?e, Gif þov slane in þe bargane be, Thy ransoun sall I gif þe qwite, I sall nocht ask þarof a myte; And gif þov be tane to presoun, Than sall þov double me þi ransoun. Sa sall men se gif als fele Off Franche wiþ Inglismen may dele. A, mychti God of Hevin,” quod he, “How ?our worschip and ?our bounte Suld be incressit mony fald Gif ?e will hereof cunnand hald.” “?is,” said he, “sall I sickerly.” Thare cunnandis band þai þare in hy, And þarto set a certane place; By Kane in Normondy it was. Quhen þai devisit had þe day, This knycht till Ingland went his way, And tald in opin þis tythand; And fra þe word spred throu þe land That, but were, tane wes sic a thing, ?oung men, þat ?arnyt to wyn loving, Wald proffer þar seruice for to gif To þare lordis till þai mycht lif For to purchess þaim, at þai mycht In nomere of þai xxx. fycht. Than in till Ingland sa did he That he chesit in gret daynte Xxx. all þire wichtest men That he couþ waill in Ingland þen; And Bewmaner in till his land, Off his freyndis þat were nere hand, And of his kyn, chesit thretty, Wicht and apert, stark and douchty; And prevely he gert inquere Off all þai men þat wiþ him were Quhilk luffit paramouris, and quhare; And quhare he herd þar luffaris ware, He maid purches sa subtelly That gif scho madin wes, his lady That he sa luffit, þan purchest he That scho suld at þat fechting be; And gif scho bundin wer in wedding, Hir lord suld hir þidder with him bring; For quhare sic thingis were ado, Him thocht it ferit weill þarto That throu þe sycht of faire ladyis Suld reif men thocht of cowardiss. Thus brocht he all þar luffaris þare, In þare sicht þat suld fecht, but mare, For he supposit at þar sicht Suld gif þaim hardyment and mycht. The day come sone, and in þe place A stalwart barras maid þar was Off mekle bastyne rapis thrungin Throu stowpis, þat full deip were dongin Within þe erd rycht stalwartly; And þidder come on athir party, Xxx. on ilk syde, for to ficht. The Franche men were gaily dicht With couerit horss in irne and steill, Bot þe Inglismen had na deill Couerit horss, as I herd say; Forþi als sone as cummyn wer þai To þare rank [end, þai] lichtit doune, And to fecht on fute maid þaim bovne. The Franche men rycht sa has done, And saw þaim licht, þai lichtit sone, And samyn went with speris straucht, And a lang quhile fen?eit and facht. Ane Inglisman had vpon a staff A hammyre hard, and þarwith gaif Sic pay þat at þar assembling He slew ane without recouering. Sa fast þar fors can þaim faynd That baith þe partiis fal?eit aynd. A litill þai withdrew þaim þen, And on þar suerdis can þaim lene, Bot þan ane of þe Franche squyeris Saw be þe fecht and þar afferis That hard wes wittour for to wyn Foroutin subtelte or gyn; He left his feris quhare þai stude, And evin towart his horss he ?ude. The Lord de Bewmaner þat saw Him, as him thocht, him sa withdraw, Said: “Cousing, I wend nocht in þe That þov þe first suld fal?eand be.” He said: “Þe rame oft gais abak, That he þe mare debait may mak.” This ansuere maid he him schortly, And held on till his horss in hy, Lap on, and agane wallopand He come, and fand þaim fast fechtand. At þe syde of þe Inglismen Sa stoutly in he bruschit þen That sturdely þaim scalit he. And quhare he saw þe mast semble Off Inglismen, in þare he raid, And rudly rovme amang þaim maid; For his horss rycht weill armyt was, That he þare stabying dred weill les. The Franchemen, þat þaim scalit saw, Ruschit on þaim, but dreid or aw, And discomfyt þaim vtraly. Nyne were slane of þar cumpany, And þe remanent all were tane. Off Franchemen þare deit nane, Outtane he þat with þe mell Wes slane, as ?e herd forouth tell. The Franchemen wes prasit gretly Off þat, at quhen þai in sic hy Saw þare fallow sa him withdraw, As it had bene for dreid or aw, And maid na takin of abasing For his richt sudand withdrawing, Bot faucht fersly furþ as befor, And son?eit nocht forþi þe more, Thai were to priss, and sa wes he, That in sa fell a chadmelle, As man for man, and nocht sa feill As þai were, and wiþ wit couþ deill, And vesynes, throu quham þai wan This batall, þat wes takin þan And endit, quhare ladyis ioly Mycht se rycht weill how manfully Thare luffaris baire þaim in þat fecht. Men may se pryde, ogart and hicht Gert þis fecht be vndirtane; Forþi men may se wit is nane To dispiss oþeris natioun, For men may weill se be ressoun That þai ar men als wele as þai, And perchans quhill pruf als wele may As þai; forthy suld nane dispiss Thare fais, for þe victour lyiss In his worschip als wele as his; Forthy me think at he wenys myss That vthire men litill or nocht is worth That beris him better quhen he cumis furþ. CHAPTER CLXXXI. How Galloway wes brocht to þe pess Throu þe Dowglass or he wald cess. ?it all þis tyme lestit þe weire Vpon þe Marche, as it did eire, And þe Lord William of Dowglass Ay wilfull and besy was For to bring to þe Scottis fay Landis þat lang were haldin away. He gaderit him a gret men?e, And in Galloway on weire went he, And with Schir Duugall Makdowall Sa tretit he at þat land haill He brocht sone to þe Scottis fay, That held it furþ fra þin ay. And syne to Karnokis Kirk brocht he This Schir Duugall to mak fewte To þe wardane; and sa Galloway Ay sen syne held Scottis fay. Hoge of Kirkpatrik Nyddisdaill Brocht to þe Scottis fay alhaill, Fra þe Castell of Dalsyntoun Wes takin and syne dongin doune, And syne Carlauerok tane has he. He wes a man of gret bounte, Honorable, wiss and worthy, And couth richt mekle of cumpany. The King Davy ?it in Ingland Wes all þis tyme at Lundone lyand, In to þe Toure as in presoune. Thare wes [na] speche of his ransoun, Till at þe last þare purchest he That he mycht pass till his cuntre One ostage, his folkis till assay Quhat helping for him set wald þai. He come hame, and maid schort byding, For he sped nocht at his liking. Agane sone held he in Ingland, As he befor had maid cunnand; And þan a langtyme lay he þare, Or word wes of his lousing mare. Syne eftir þat þe Lord of Kyle With a gret folk þat samyn quhile, That syne eftir wes Erll of Carrik, And alsua prince of oure kinrik, Maid in Annanderdaill a raid, And in þat cuntre sa lang baid, Till all þe folkis of þat cuntre Consentit Scottismen to be, And sware to hald þe Scottis fay; And þat aith eftir weill held þai. And quhen he stablist had þat cuntre, Agane till his resset went he. CHAPTER CLXXXII. How King Dauid wes ransound For a hundreth thousand pound. A thousand iii?. and fyfty ?ere And sex þarto withoutin weire, That ?ere þe noble King Iohne of France Wes tane at Poyters apon chance. In presoun ?it wes King Davy. And quhen sa langtyme wes gane by, Out of Lundone brocht wes he To Berwik Castell, for to se Gif þai mycht trete of his ransoun With þe Erll of Northamptoun. The lordis of Scotland come þare, And prelatis all þat wisest ware. Foure dais or five þare tretit þai; Bot þai concord couth be na way, For þe Inglis all angry ware, And spak ay outwart mare and mare, Till at þe last þe Scottis party, That dred þe mekle fellony, All prevely went hame þar way, And at þat tyme na mare did þai. The king to Lundone agane wes had, And þare a langtyme eftir baid. Bot ?it throu mediatioun Off message þan for his ransoun Wes tretit, till at a set day To Berwik him agane brocht þai. And þan wes tretit þare þat he Suld of presoun deliuerit be, And frely till his cuntre found, To pay ane hundreth thousand pound Off siluer and gold in xiiii. ?ere. And at þat payment at termes seire To mak sa lang trewis tuke þai, And it affermyt with seillis and fay. And þarwith gret ostage left he That on þar avne expensis suld be. Forthy, quhill þai in ostage ware, Expensis but nomer maid þai þare. The king wes þan deliuerit fre, And come on hame in his cuntre. With him of Ingland brocht he nane, Bot a chalmer child allane. And sa apon þe morne, quhen he Suld pass till his counsall preve, The folk, as þai were wont to do, Pressit rycht rudly þarto; Bot smertly þare he can araiss Out of a masaris hand a mass, And said rudly: “How do we now? Stand still, or þe prowdest of ?ow Sall on þe heid haif wiþ þis maiss.” Than wes þare neuer ane in þat place, That þai na gaif him rovme in hy; Durst na man press forthire; forthy His counsall dure mycht opin stand, That nane durst be þarto pressand. Raddour in prince is worthy thing; For but raddour all gouernyng Sall wyle worth and dispisit be; And quhare þat men may raddour se, Men will dreid to trespas, and sa A king peceable his land may ma. Lo, how raddour gert him dred be, And bot a boy wiþ him brocht he; ?it þan for his stout gouernyng He gert his folk haif sic dreding Off him, þat nane durst nyth him nere, Bot gif he specially callit were. He led wiþ raddour sa his land, In all þe tyme he wes regnand, That nane durst weill wiþstand his will; All worth þar obeyand him till. Mysdoaris ay chasty he wald. The trewis he gert keip and hald; ?it þan oft ryot wald þai ma, Preke and tak poyndis to and fra; Bot at þe dayis of redress The mast forss ay redressit wes. The king at Melross oft wald ly, Quhen ony gret of þe toþer party Come dais of trewis for till hald. Enfors his marche sa he wald. He wald ryde oft in Ingland With semely court and weill farand, And at Lundone play him wald he; For þare wes rycht gret specialte Betuix him and þe King Edwart.

A weill lang tyme þe King Davy Gouernyt þe kinrik stoutly. Aganis stoutnes he wes stout; To meik men he wes meik, but dout, And gaif to gentillis largely.

Qwhen þat oure King Davy wes dede, His sister sone in till his steid, Robert Stewart, wes maid king, Specially throu þe helping Off gud Schir Robert of Erskyne, [That] Edinburgh Dunbertane and Striuelyne Had in his keping þan, all thre; For worthy, wiss, and lele wes he. He knew þe Stewartis rycht; Tharfor he helpit him at his mycht To gere him haif at his suld be; And þarfor with a gret men?e To Lithqw wiþ him can he pass. Thare þe Erll William of Dowglas Schupe to mak him agane char; Bot þan þe Erll George of Dunbare, And his broþer, with þar men?e, Come with þe Stewartis rycht to be; Sa þat Erll William of Dowglass Throu þare powere sa stonayit was That he tretit him his sone suld wed The kingis dochtir and bring to bed, And he suld till his king ay do As a trew liege man suld do; And þe king to þat mariage Gaif gold and land in heretage. Thus eftir a rude begynnyng Thai maid a soft and gud ending. The king gert set a certane day, And for his crovnyng gert purvay, Quhare mychtely crovnit wes he. Thare all his baronis maid him fewte; Wes nane þat schupe him to withstand; He wes haill king oure all þar land. The trewis þat befor xiiii. ?ere Wes takin ?it and nocht [endyt were]; Forþi at dayis of [redress] Sumquhile þe Erll of Carrik wes, And quhile þe Erll of Fif, his broþer, As speidfull wes, quhile ane, quhile oþer, Off Marche till enfors þe wardanis, That had gret partyis þaim aganis. Thus did þai till þe trewis can lest; Transgressouris þai correkit best. Bot syne, or þai all endit ware, Endlang þe Marche fer and neire Thai begouth to ploid and ta Catall and poyndis, to and fra. At Roxburght þat tyme wes a faire, And Scottis þidder maid repaire. And amangis oþer þare come a man, That with þe Erll George duelt þan, And wes ane of his avne houshald, Donald Tal?eour he wes cald; And wiþ þe Erll he wes preve, For ane of his chalmer wes he. The Inglismen in þare fellony Slew him for litill chesoun quhy. The Erll George all angry wes Off his slauchtir, and askit redress Off þaim þat fellonly slew his man. Bot þat þai nyte him planely þan; Forthy he said at his cuntre Suld na langer in trewis be; And on þe Sanct Lowrens day, The quhilk is þe last, as þai say, Off þat faire, in þe dawing He come prevely wiþ his gadering, And to [þe] castell set his staill, And syne gert byrne vp þe tovne haill, Quhare mekle gudis, and mony men Armyt, in loftis brynt were þen. And quhen þe toune dispul?eit wes, Till his cuntre þan can he pas, And held him vengit of his man, That þai had slane litill befor þan. CHAPTER CLXXXIV. How þe Lord of Gordoun faucht With þe Lilburne and all his maucht.

And quhen þat he herd how þat his fe Wes tane, a cumpany gat he, And raid in Ingland for to ta A poynd, and sone it happinnit sa That he of catall gat a pray, And held hamewart þarwith his way. Bot Schir Iohne of Lilburne, þat was A marcheare nere by, gaderit has All þe gud men þat he mycht get, And forouth him þe way with set, And come syne to þe fechting neire. Gordoune saw þat his fais were Fere ma þan he; bot nocht forþi His men he comfort sa stoutly, And sa gud wordis spak þaim till That all his folk to fecht had will, And by Carrame assemblit þai; Thare wes hard fechting, as I herd say. Bot throu Gordonis gret bounte The oure hand had his men and he. Bot he þat day wes stad straitly; For he wes woundit wickitly, And fyve syse wes at gret myscheif; Bot ay he gat help and releif. Lilburne wes, and his broþer, tane, And of his folk were mony slane, That in a lwmp togidder lay; The nomer of þaim I can nocht say; And þe laif of his folkis ilkane, That mycht nocht fle, in handis were tane. Gordoune come hame þan wiþ his pray; Bot he wes ill woundit, þai say; ?it þan he couerit weill eftir sone. And of þis deid, þat he had done, Thare rakit of him gret renovne; For prisit hiely wes þe Gordoun. The Lord Persy þare at weill tyte Tuke in till hert rycht gret dispite, And at þe Erll George vpgevin had The trewis, and alsua for he maid At Roxburght sic martyr of men. He gaderit quhill at he had þen Off gudmen ma þan vii. thousand, And in till þe Erll Georgis land He enterit, in entent to ma All waist quhare euer he mycht ourta. At Dunss he tuke his herbery, And schupe him þare all nycht to ly. Bot quhen þe nycht weill falling wes, A gret effray amang þaim raiss, Sa þat þe gretest of þare rout Stude armyt all þat nycht þarout, Rycht as þai suld ga to þe assay. Thare wes amangis þaim sic affray That of [þar horss] brak lowss mony, And held on hame in weill gret hy Attour þe watter of Tweid agane. And quhen þe Persy in sic pane Had standing all þat nycht till day, And saw þare horss were fleit away, He left þe purposs þat he had tane, And till Ingland agane is gane; And þai þat on þar fut left ware Hame on þar bakkis þe harnes baire. Sa fell it at þe chevalry Scathit nocht þe cuntre gretly. Schire Thomas of Musgrave þat tyde Wist at þe Lord Persy wald ryde; Than with all þe folkis of Berwik That worthy ware, baith pure and ryke, To Dunss he tuke his way to faire. Bot Gordoun, at we spak of aire, With his gudmen in cumpany, Met him in þe way sodanely, And sa abaisit maid Musgrave That he, and his, and all þe laif, Off þat sicht were abaisit sa That þai haly þe flicht can ta. Thare wes bot few slane in þe chace; Schire Thomas Musgrave takin was, And of his folkis þe mast party, And mony eschapit; nocht forthy The trewis þan nere endit were, That takin were for xiiii. ?ere. Apone þe west Marche als þan fell Seire iuperdyis, as I herd tell. For at þe watter of Sulway Schire Iohne of Iohnestoun on a day Discomfit of Inglismen gret deill. He baire him in all tyme sa weill That he, and þe Lord of Gordoun, Had a richt hie souerane renovne Off ony oþer of þare degre, Thai were so full of gret bounte. CHAPTER CLXXXV. How Erll William of Dowglass Brynt Penreth tovne at a raiss. A thousand thre hundreth and fifty ?ere And þe sext of oure Lord deire, The Erll William of Dowglass In till his hert rycht angry wes That þe Persy, as I said eire, Had riddin in þe Merss of weire. He gaderit him men of gret bounte Off diuerss cuntreis, quhill þat he [Had] xx. thousand worthy men, And delt þaim in thre batallis þen, And toward Penreth held his way, And come þare vpon þar faire day. Bothis fand þai still standand; Thai maid all þaris þat euer þai fand, And þai þat maid debait þai slew, And eftir þe retrete þai blew, And turnyt hamewartis eftir syne. Bot sum, þat drunkin were of wyne, And couth nocht weill þaim selfin keip, All for drunking fell on sleip, And slepand takin were or slane. Bot þe gret ost come haill agane With prayis and wiþ presoneris, And oþer gudis on seire maneris; And but bargane, or mare tinsall, Hame to þar avne land come alhaill.

Thai tynt men in sindry place, Sa þat weill neire done þaim was Als gret scaith as þai did, outtane The birnyng of þe abbais allane. Robert Erll of Fife þat tyde Assemblit men on ilka syde In Ingland for to mak a raid. In cumpany he with him had The Erll Iames of Dowglas, And alsua Schir Archibald þar was; Sua þat þai all assemblit þen With xxx. thousand fechtand men. Than passit þai attour Sulway, And held to Kokyrmouth þar way.

That tyme Schir William of Dowglass, That þe Erll Archibaldis sone was, Wes a ?oung ioly bachilere, And prisit richt gretly of weire; For he wes alway travaland, Quhile be þe se, and quhile be land, For to scaith his fais besy, Sa þat þai dred him gretumly. He raid oftsyss in Ingland, Slaand, distroyand, and birnand. He brynt þe subwrbs of Carleill, And at þe barres faucht sa weill That on þe brig he slew a man, The wichtest in þe toune wes þan, Quhare on a plank bot twa fut braid He stude, and sa gud payment maid That he fellit twa sturdy fechteris, And syne but scaith come till his feris.

Syne eftir, quhen a quhile wes gane, He vencust apon Sulway sand Off Inglismen wele four thousand, Quhare twa hundreth in feild were slane, And ma þan five hunder þan tane, As þai þat tald me þare beand. He wes sa stoutly travelland, And put him to sa hard assayis, That, to say suth, in till my dais I haif nocht herd a bachilere Sa gretly prisit, fer na neire, In to sa schort tyme as wes he. The king gaif him for his bounte His dochter Dame Gylis, þat wes Farest of all fassoun and face That men mycht fynd þat day liffand Within þe kynrik of Scotland; And with faire gyft Nyddisdaill In mariage he gaif him haill.

The Erll of Fiff ane oþer raid To pass in Ingland boun him maid, And gaderit a fere mare poware To scaithis his fais þan he did aire, For he thocht forthir for to ryde. And sa in to þis samyn tyde This ilk Schir William of Dowglas Apone se þan schippit was Till Irland with a few men?e, Five hundreth fechtaris, men said me. At Kerlynfyrth aryvit þai, That wes envyround, as I herd say, And closit weill wiþ stalwart wall, And a stark castell þar withall The folkis þat were within þe tovne Tretit wiþ him, as in tresoun, To gif him gold a quantite To assouer þaim and lat þaim be. Syne send þai word full prevely To þaim of Dundalk nere by, That wiþ viii. hunder stout and wycht On trappit horss come for to ficht, And all þai alsua of þe toune Ischit to fecht at habandoune. Schire William þan þe land had tane, And wiþ him to þe land wes gane, I trow, twa hunder, or few ma; For all þe laif þan stad were sa That, for defalt of small weschall, Thai mycht nocht to þe land wyn haill. The Irland men þan delt in twa, And sa furþ straucht can till him ga; Bot Schir Robert Stewart send he Befor, bot wiþ a few men?e, For he had nocht folkis for to depart For till encountyr þe ta part. On Schir William schot þe gret rout; Bot he, þat sturdy wes and stout, Met þaim with sa gret hardynes That in schort tyme all þat rome wes Sa baisit at þare baid na man. ?it wes Schir Robert Stewart þan Fechtand wiþ all þe toþer rout, That had envyround him about, And had sone slane him and his men; Bot Schir William persauit þen His mischeif, and can him reskourss, Or ellis he had bene at rebourss. The Irlandis folkis saw his cummyng, And tuke þe flicht, but gane turnyng. Fra dede þus savit wes þat knycht, And þare fais put to þe flicht. The toune þan tuke þai fut steppand, And maid all þaris þat þai þar fand. Xv. schippis, þat in þe raid Lay with gudis, away þai had; And syne þai brynt vp all þe toune, And dang doune castell and dungeoun, And syne þai held on hame þar way. The Ile of Man als þan brint þai, And aryffit at Lochryane; Syne in gret hy þe way has tane Southwartis on till Ingland; For men had gert him vndirstand The Erll of Fif with mony men, And his fadir, wes rydand þen In Ingland, and in Ryddisdaill. He ouretuke þaim, quhare alhaill The ost wes glaid of his cummyng, And had þarof recomforting. CHAPTER CXCIV. Off þe Batall of Ottirburne And how Persy wes tane þat turne. The Erll Iames þan of Dowglas, That had maid cunnand for to pas In þe Erll of Fiffis cumpany, Fal?eit þarof vtraly; For þi þe Erll his wayis raid With all þe gret ost þat he had, That nomerit were xxx. thousand, And ma, as men gert me vndirstand, Evin to Burgh vndir Stanemure, And þare sa rudly with þaim fure That þai þe townys brynt in þe land, As fer as þai were travelland. The Erll Iames, we spak of eire, Had gaderit men þat worthy were, Quhill he ware neire vii. thousand, That he thocht he mycht tak on hand, Wiþ sic folk as he had þare, But maire help in Ingland to faire. He held his way wiþ his men?e, Off rycht sa gret curage wes he, That to þe New Castell of Tyne He raid, or euer he wald fyne. Thareof his knychtis and squyeris Fon?eit and faucht at þe barreris, And he in staill huffit stane still Till his folkis fochtyn had þar fill. And quhen he lang had huffit þare, He tuke his way hamewart to faire. And þan wes in þat toune lyand All þe floure of Northummyrland, And fra ?ork inwart halely, With ?oung Schir Henry þe Percy, That had gert spy þe Erllis rout Off Fif; bot, for it wes sa stout, He durst nocht meit him to fecht þare. Forthy sone fra þat he saw faire Erll Iames towart his cuntre, With all his gadering ischit he, That nomerit weill were x. thousand, Or ma, as men me baire on hand. He followit fast þe erllis trass, That raid ay till he cummyn was Till Ottirburne in Ryddisdaill. And þare his oste lichtit alhaill, Wnarmyt þaim, and set pal?eonis, And for þe heit tuke on syde govnis, And at sic mete as þai mycht get. Bot þai bot schort quhile þarat sat, Quhen a ?oung man come fast rydand, That said þar fais were at þar hand, And cryit, “Tais armes,” hastely, And sa þai did in full gret hy. Bot þat wes done with sa gret speid That mony wantit at þat neid Cuscheis, greis, or braseris, Or oþer armouris on seire maneris. The Erll Iames wes sa besy For till array his oste haly, And for to fecht sa egyre was, That he tuke nocht on in þat place His cot armour, bot wes for?et; The Erll of Murraiffis basnet, Men sais, wes for?et alsua, And oþer mony lordis ma. Thai saw þare fais neire cumand Attour a weill sumdeill heldand, That delt were in to batallis twa: The Persy wes þe tane of þai; The toþer Robert Ogile had tane, And with Schir Maw þe Reid Mayne. Thai had ordanit þat þe Percy With all þaim of his cumpany Suld mete þe erll, gif he wald fecht, And Ogill and his feire suld ryde rycht To þe pal?eonis, and þare, Till þe ostis baith fechtand ware, Sla and distroy all at þai fand. With þis Erll Iames wes passand Towart his fais þe narrest way, Quhare buskis were, as I herd say. The Inglismen saw nocht his cummyng, For þai had fere mare behalding To Scottis commonis, at þai saw fle. And quhen þai had a litill we Behalding þaim þat fleand was, The Erll Iames of Dowglas Wes past þe buskis, and sodanely Boltit vp, and at a bra þaim by, With xii. displayit banaris, or ma. And quhen þe Inglismen saw him sa Cumand sa neire all sodanely, Thai were abaisit in gret party, And lichtit doune as in effray, For þai were nocht knyt in array As þai befor thocht till haif bene. For þare fais, withoutin wene, Were sa neire þat na knytting Mycht þai mak, bot as fell hapnyng. Bot with gret faire ?it nocht forþi Thai assemblit rycht hardely. The day wes at þare assembling Richt at þe sonnis doune passing; Thai facht þan fersly till þe nycht. Bot sa it fell þat of þat fycht The Scottismen þan victour had. Off Inglismen gret slauchtir þai maid; For þai were þare all vtraly Vencust, and tane wes þe Persy, And his broþer alsua wes tane. Bot þe Erll Iames þar wes slane, That na man wist on quhat manere. It suld ken chiftanis in to weire For till haif gud men neire þaim by In fecht, for to keip þar body; For als sone may in fecht be slane A mychti man, as knaif or swayne, As fell of þis lord in þat steid. For perchans he had nocht bene deid And men had set on him ?emsell. Bot he deit worthely and weill; For throu his curage, þat wes stout, His folk had þare victour all out. Qwhen þe feild wencust wes, as I ?ow tald, þe Scottis men hiddously Herd at þar pal?eonis cry and rare; Than wist þai þare þare fais ware, And sped þaim þidderwartis in hy, And fand þe Inglismen halely Wonnand, as all þar avne ware. Than schot þai on þaim sodanely þare, And slew nere all vp at þai fand; Thai were nere all nycht slaand, Sum sais a thousand þare, Sum xv. hundreth, and sum mare. Thare deit als on þe Scottis party Twa gud knychtis and worthy: Schir Robert Hert men callit þe tane, That in þe feild wes slane certane; Schire Iohne of Towris þe toþer, þat syne Come hame woundit, and þar maid fyne. And Schir Thomas of Erskin was Woundit þar felly in þe face. He may weill, syne þe weme apperis, Eit in þe gret hall of Poyteris. The Scottismen all þat nycht þare lay; And on þe morne, quhen it wes day, The Erll Iames nakit þai fand In þe feild wiþ oþer hand, That had a gret wound in þe hals, Ane oþer in his visage als. Thai had him till his pal?eone; Till haif him hame þai maid þaim bovne. Bot ?it till mydmorne baid þai þare, Syne tuk þar way hamewartis to faire; With þaim þar woundit men led þai; There presoneris, as I herd say, Were als feill as þaim selfin ware. And sa rydand on þat manare In þare avne cuntre hame come þai, And scalit syne ilk man his way. The Erll of Fife in till Ingland Wes ?it distroyand and birnand; Bot on þe morne he herd tything Off þe wictour of þis fechting; And of þe erllis deid he wes anoyit; Bot of his fais þat were distroyit In till his hert rycht blith wes he. And quhen he in till þat cuntre Had duelt till him thocht, syne his way He tuke, and come hame oure Sulway, But tinsall ouþer of gudis or men, And all a quhile him restit þen. CHAPTER CXCV. How þe Erll of Fif wiþ his ost Raid to pruf Erll Marschellis bost. A thousand and thre hundreth ?ere Fourescore and þarto nyne all cleire, In to þe winter followand, The king wiþ lordis of þe land At Edinburgh a counsall held; And for þe king him febill feld For eild, and for his eldest sone Wes nocht fery as he wes won, With assent of his thre commonis, Bischopis, burgessis, and baronis, The Erll of Fif wes maid wardane; And he suore he suld set his pane To keip þe land in pess and weire. And all þe lordis þare can suere To gif him leill counsall þarto, And als to help him þat to do. In Ingland syne, fra þe Persy Wes tane, as forouth þis tald I, Thai maid þe Erll Marcheall Kepare of þe marchis haill, That spak proud wordis and mudy, And repruffit dispitously The Inglismen at þe fechting Off Ottirburne, and in scornyng Said þai were nocht to priss, at sa Were tane wiþ Scottis, sen þai were ma, And come als on þaim sodanely, To hald agane þaim ony party; Lettand at he suld beris bynd, Mycht he on feild þe Scottis fynd. The wardane herd þire wordis tyte, And at his speche had gret dispite, And semblit sone ane ost in hy; With him Erll Archibald wes treuly; And with þaim twa mony gudman. The Erll Marschall had gaderit þan All þe floure of þe north cuntre, And in a strenth him herbryit he. The wardane herd weill quhare he was, And with his ost in hy can pas Rycht evin forouth him, quhare he lay, And baid him cum furþ, and assay His horss, as he had hecht befor. Bot he wald do þarto no more; Bot ansuerd þat he wald nocht then Put in perill þe kingis men. And quhen þe wardane saw at he Wald nocht cum furþ to þe melle, And þare had huffit neire half a day, Till his herbery he tuke þe way; And syne come hamewartis distroyand, The cuntre forouth him waistand. That tyme at Bulone by þe se Wes a tretiss of vnyte Betuix þe Franche and Inglismen, Quhare thre ?eris trewis were takin þen; Quharein þe Scottismen and þe king Wes specifyit, and þare liking To hald þai trewis, or be on weire. Forthy twa messingeris wes there Send out of France, to gere þe king Off Ingland swere to hald þat thing. He swore, as it accordit was, And twa of his syne gert he pas In Scotland to þe king, to se Gif he in to þat trewis wald be; Schire Nycole of Degword hecht þe tane. Thir twa messingeris ar gane With þaim in Scotland to þe king, To se þe end of all þis thing. The king wes þan at Dunfermelyne, Quhare he befor a quhile had lyne, And had with him oft his barnee Off þe gretest lordis of degre. That wardane þare þan wiþ him was, And þe Erll Archibald of Douglas. Thir messingeris were þidder cummyn, And innys in to þe toune had nummyn. The king maid rycht faire countynance To þe twa messingeris of France, And honorit þaim richt gretumly. Bot þir Inglismen, þat were by, Thocht richt ill quhen þai herd there The Scottismen desyrit were. Forþi þai went till Erll Archibald, And þare entent haill till him tald, And þat wes, gud ware till haif pess, To gere hereschip and slauchtir cess; And prayit him on þat to stand. Quod he: “To þe king of þis land And to þe wardane, as ?e se, That fallis to, and nocht to me.” Than went þai on to þe wardane, And he ansuerd to þaim agane That all wes in þe kingis will, To werray, or to hald him still. Tharewith þai to þe king ar gane, And in to cumpany has tane The Franche knychtis in þar helping, Knelit all foure befor þe king, And tald quhat rest of pess mycht ryss, And how þat angeris mony wyss Happinnis in all tymes of weire; Forthy þai maid him faire prayere To assent at þe trewis mycht hald. And he said he aviss him wald. And quhen he w[es apon þat thing] Avisit, he maid ansu[ering] That, for þe request of [Franche men], That specially him prayit þen, He wald þe trewis haldin ware, And all as wes forspokin aire; And to þe halding swore he sone, As þe twa kingis befor had don[e]. This in his eild wes richt hon[est], That þai suld mak him sic req[uest], And of sic ambassatouris as þai, At send ware fra þe kingis twa. CHAPTER CXCVI. Off a gret iusting that be[fell]; Off sic ane oþer herd I nocht [tell]. Than at Bulone vpon the se A weill gret tretiss þare suld be Betuix þir kingis of trewis and pess, And dais þarof ordanit wes, Quhare messingeris of þir kingis thre Suld assemble of þat trete. The messingeris of Scotland Were thare a weill lang quhile tretand; Bot nane end at þat tyme maid wes Noþer of lang trewis na of pess. In þat tyme at Calice befell Ane auenture were gud to tell, Baith for þe gretnes of þe thing, And for þe hie vndirtaking. Set at it lang nocht þis mater, ?it men will haif plesance till heire It, þat in armes has delite, Forthy in cornykillis I it write; For quhy hie worschip and bounte Suld on na wiss for?ettin be. Thre gud knychtis of Pykardy, The best men callit þe Lord Samby xxiiii. ?ere syne þe toþer cleire Schir Bransagant I wiss, And þe thrid of þame to þis Wes hattyn Ranald de Roy. Þir thre Gert mak in seire landis a crye, Till hald a iusting xxx. dais In till a feild beside Calais Agane all nationis, outtane Scottis and Franche men allane. And þe maner of þat assay Suld be on þis wiss done perfay: Thare pal?eonis first suld stentit be, And þai suld hing þar scheildis thre, Off þare armes and þare bering; And quhasa come to ask iusting Suld twiche ane of þai with a spere, And gif it were a speire of weire The knycht suld at þe armes baire Thre courss of weire ryn till him þare; And gif his speire of pess were, he Suld þan of pess deliuerit be Thre courss; and sa of pess and weire Thai iustis entermellit were. Thai come þare forouth þe set day, And þare pal?eonis sone stentit þai, And ordanit for þar purviance. Bot þe richt noble King of France, That herd speik gretly of þis thing That wes of sa hie vndirtaking, Send þaim of flurynys xxx. thousand, And xxx. stedis weill at hand, Sa that þare cost weill mycht mak þai, And brist a steid als ilk day. Thai fulfillit richt apertly Thare vndirtaking and knychtly. Thai held þe iusting thrette dayis, Quhair þat foure skoir, as men sayis, Iustit wiþ þame, knychttis and squyeris, Off sic þat xii. war borones, And sevin mychtty erlis; bot thai Contenyt þame sa stoutly ay, That xxxvi. of þis taill War laid at erd, and þai held haill; And thre war slane þair vterly. ?it men said þe Lord Samby Iustit wele fyftie courss and mair Than ony of his ferys did þair; For men at him hade mair inwy For his empryce, bot he stoutly Set þame of wele all þat þai were, And ?itt he leiffit haill and feir. Quhen þai hade endyt þair emprice, Thai went þan to Boloun; þair is Fairly hallowyt Sanct Mary, And þair þai offerit wp richyly Thair armes, and maid þair lovyng; Syne went in France wp to þe king, That for þair worthy cheualry Rewardyt þame rycht honorabilly. CHAPTER CXCVII. Off Robert oure Kingis ending And of his eldest sonnis crownyng. In þe tyme of þis tretyss Was at Boloune, at I deuise, Secund Robert of Scotland King As God purwayid, maid his ending.
