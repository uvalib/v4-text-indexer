      <field name="fulltext">TO K. G. T. I.—TALES. LAURELLA. PART FIRST. I Twas morning in Sorrento; voiceless lay The sea, beneath the dim grey eyes of dawn; Vesuvius' breath, low-looming, crept away O'er town and town, to where white Naples shone; On misty peaks still wandered the young day, Yet void was every house, the townsfolk gone; The beach was all alive, where by the cliffs The fishers hauled their nets or launched their skiffs. II Like gulls awaked by morning's earliest beaming From ocean-haunted sleep, woke that wild clan; Like gulls upon the shore they clustered, screaming Harshly their guttural Neapolitan. With gull-like greed their eager eyes were gleaming O'er shuddering heaps of fish; even children ran To swell the concourse mustering there, to reap With clamorous toil the harvest of the deep. III A motley throng, and not an idle hand Able to haul a rope or grasp an oar! Stout women, brown and barelegged, on the strand Toiled with their mates to tug the nets ashore; Young girls were sorting fish; boys with their tanned And weather-grizzled grandsires proudly bore Their manly part—rove haulyards, mended sails, Or, just afloat, shook canvas from the brails. IV ‘O pescator del onne, zi-ghe-zi!’ The song went quivering through the clear, cold air, Shrill, yet so sweet that coy Tranquillity, Bending to hear, flung back her dewy hair. It seemed as the wild gladness of the sea Cheerily leaped to greet the morning fair; But we must leave the ethereal fields of song For the more mundane babble of the throng. V Not a red-kerchieft crone, who, bent with age, The twirling wool from breast-borne distaff twitched, But gossiped shrill with true Calabrian rage, News-tingling tongues discharged in ears that itched. Like household Fates they plied their labour sage, Spinning the daily fleece of life, enriched With crimson threads of scandal—bits of colour In the dull yarn which without these were duller. VI A conclave high of powers grandmotherly, Awful as Goethe's ‘Mothers!’ and around Their feet, like saplings round the veteran tree, Were children gathered, making mirthful sound. Here impish boys tumbled in boisterous glee, And there small girls sat gravely on the ground, Motherlike nursing their live dolls of brothers, Or drinking wisdom from their fathers' mothers. VII ‘Look, granny, granny,’ cried a chit of ten, Sedately posed at one grey sibyl's side, Treasuring their gossip to retail again, While with the best her inch of spindle vied. ‘Here comes our Padre!’ ‘Drop your curtsey then.’ ‘Your manners pazzarella! God be his guide! The Virgin bring him back!’ whereon the chorus, With shrieked-out blessings cracked their tongue sonorous. VIII ‘He's bound for Capri—Tonio rows him there, The grand Signora his confession waits; She kneels to none but him, since at his prayer Our Lady drove death's angel from her gates; Ay, though ten doctors, come from Heaven knows where, Gloomy as gravestones, shook their learned pates.’ ‘God bless him!’ chimed the chorus, ‘for her cure She left a heap of ducats for the poor.’ IX The shoreward-moving Priest, whose cassock black Clothed with heaven's grace a maccaroni-fed Brisk little plump Curato, smiling back, Returned the blessings rained upon his head. A kindly man he looked, yet did not lack A genial shrewdness in his visage red, Which beamed upon his flock, as round his throat He drew his cloak and entered Tonio's boat. X This Tonio (he's our hero) was a youth, A smart young fellow of the fisher kind; To climb, row, swim, or sail a boat, in sooth, In all the coast his peer 'twere hard to find; His clear, brown face, too, wore a look of truth Rare in those parts; his limbs were well designed, At least for Nature's handiwork; for surely She often moulds our human clay but poorly. XI He was a sturdy, not ill-tempered fellow, Deemed handy by the local cognoscenti; Was poor, no doubt, in metals white and yellow, But all the world's our own at three-and-twenty. And in this sun-loved land of Masaniello Mere life is joy, mere maccaroni plenty; And Tonio, though his life was somewhat rough, Lived in the sun and air blithely enough. XII Besides, he was not without ‘expectations:’ He had been left an orphan, it is true, And poorly off; but he had snug relations, Especially one thrifty uncle, who, Wealthy by land and sea, tried Tonio's patience By hinting what he would or would not ‘do’ On his behalf, when he had sunk his money In a long-talked-of fishery for tunny. XIII Tonio should be Padrone, if he pleased him, A prospect Tonio hailed with huge delight; But nothing came of it; and then he had teased him To wed some girl—a rich ill-tempered fright, Whereat when Tonio kicked, the humour seized him To keep the culprit so extremely tight, The whole town cried out Shame! There's not a doubt he Had very crusty ways, although not gouty. XIV Thus Tonio was compelled, for bare existence, To scratch this dunghill of a world for bread: He had his boat, and toiled with her assistance Above the waves of life to hold his head. By petty jobs he gained his scant subsistence, Ferrying to-day, for instance, as they said, The Priest to Capri—carrying in addition His uncle's oranges upon commission. XV ‘How looks the day, Antonio?’ quoth the Priest, Casting an anxious glance upon the sky. ‘For heat, sir,—no mistral to-day at least.’ ‘Off, then, before the sun gets scorching high— ‘What keeps you, man?’ he asked, as Tonio ceased His off-shove in mid act, and fixed his eye Where, by a path precipitous, from the height A girl ran down, waving her kerchief white. XVI ‘See, Padre, by your leave,’ he answered shyly, ‘She wants to go—we've room, sir, and to spare, For three the size of that’—and with a smile he Jerked thumb apologetic towards this fair But extra freight. ‘Oho!’ the Priest said drily, ‘Laurella, eh? To Capri?—and why there?’ Antonio shrugged his shoulders with a sigh, And murmured softly: ‘That God knows, not I.’ XVII Meanwhile the girl came swiftly to the shore, Lithe as a cat, eager as the young year; Her dress, though mean, was rentless, and she wore All with a savage grace no court could peer. And with a savage pride her head she bore, Stepping the earth as one who knows not fear; You would have vowed, so queenly was her air, She felt a crown above her crisp dark hair. XVIII ‘Hey, la Rabbiata!’ cried a hulking wag, Raising rude laughter, ‘how go frowns to-day? Heavens, what a face! last night she met some hag, And stole her mali umori!’ Her proud way, With feet that hasted not, nor yet did lag, Straight through the crowd she held; nought did she say, But her brown face grew pale, and her deep eyes Blazed like the first swift flash from thunderous skies. XIX ‘Good-day, Laurella—are you for the sea? You go with us to Capri?’ said her Pastor, With his most gracious smile; and coldly she: ‘Yes, Padre, if I may.’ ‘We'll go the faster, So Tonio thinks—step in then; as for me, You're welcome, child, but ask the vessel's master.’ She laid a half carlin where Tonio sat— ‘There is my fare, if I may go for that.’ XX Her voice was cold, and from Antonio's face She kept her eyes averted with a frown, Which somehow but enhanced her savage grace. And Tonio, too, sat with his eyes cast down; But at her words he shifted in his place, And with an injured air he viewed the brown And battered coin, then growled out sullenly, ‘Keep it—God knows you need it more than me.’ XXI ‘I will not go for nothing.’ ‘Have your way.’ ‘Come, come!’ the Priest said, ‘step into the boat; Don't let this wrangling keep us here all day. He's a good lad, Antonio—see, his coat He has spread here for your comfort—more, I'll say, Than e'er he did for me. So—we're afloat.’ Without a word she had thrust the coat aside, And his fierce seaward shove meant, ‘Curse her pride!’ XXII Thus did they leave the land, and soon their skiff Danced o'er the glittering wavelets of the sea. The oarsman, chafing inly from their tiff, Worked off his wrath in vigorous strokes; but she, Frowning no more, gazed at the east, as if The dawnlight lulled her to a reverie. The Priest broke silence first: ‘What have you there, In that small bundle, child, lapped with such care?’ XXIII ‘Silk, Padre, and some hanks of homespun thread, And a brown loaf. The silk I hope to sell To one in Anacapri—Nita said She wanted silk for ribbons, thread as well, And I spin both, you know. The loaf of bread, That's for my dinner.’ ‘Why, you worked a spell At ribbons once yourself?’ ‘Mother's so bad I can't hire out—a loom we never had.’ XXIV ‘Your mother worse? When did I see her last? At Easter was it? She was finely then.’ ‘She has been failing, sir, these three years past, And those bleak winds racked her poor bones again, Just like last year, and now she's breaking fast.’ ‘That's sad, that's sad! Pray, my child, pray; for when Troubles come God is nighest, and in our need The Holy Mother loves to intercede.’ XXV A moment's pause, and a new question came: ‘What was that ugly word they called you, child, “Good morning, la Rabbiata?”—What a name! A Christian maiden should be meek and mild.’ The brown face flushed, again the indignant flame Leaped from her tameless eyes in lightning wild. ‘They mock me so because I will not sing, Chatter, and dance, like every idle thing.’ XXVI ‘Well, well, you are no idle thing, I know, And not much given to chattering; but your tongue Shoots bitter arrows sometimes—is't not so? You have your trials, hard for one so young; But patience is a grace. You are lonely though, And poor, yet scorn to wed, they tell me.’ Stung With some fierce thought, she turned first pale, then red, And burst out: ‘They say true—whom should I wed?’ XXVII ‘There was that painter—what has come of him? Not a bad man, they say; and yet you lent him But angry ears, and would not, through some whim, Let him even paint you.’ ‘Would none else content him? There's fifty prettier girls,’ she answered grim; ‘Why did he want my face? What would preven him, For all I know, if I had given him that, Bewitching me? I saw what he was at.’ XXVIII She was much moved. It seemed as though a chill Ran shuddering through her spirit—that cold blast Pure natures feel when first the breath of ill, Pleading from angel's tongue, they stand aghast In a half-dazed defiance. Kindly still The Priest went blundering on: ‘My daughter, cast Such heathenish fears aside. The Lord will keep His faithful, as the shepherd does the sheep. XXIX ‘And the man loved you, child, and would have raised Above all want.’ ‘Curse on such love!’ she cried; ‘Better my want.’ Her Pastor was amazed; This wild volcanic wrath the Church must chide. A young thing too! perhaps the girl was crazed? ‘O fie! Laurella, fie! what means this pride?’ ‘I want no husband—no man's love!’ she said. ‘Then would you be a nun?’ She shook her head. XXX 'Tis quite appalling, and the masculine mind, Lining or coat or cassock, must perplex After whole centuries' culture still to find This wilful wild-oats in the gentler sex; To see (O tempora!) well-tamed womankind Turn restive, tear the yoke from their soft necks, Kick up their heels, and, like Laurella here, Bolt from that paddock blandly termed ‘their sphere’! XXXI The good man was perplexed. She would not wed, Nor take the veil! The thing was strange—what notion Had got into the little vixen's head? Most women have two poles—love and devotion, But neither could be fairly credited With this abnormal outburst of emotion; Yet he half guessed 'twas love; for at eighteen What else could such preposterous conduct mean? XXXII Still he was much perplexed: he rubbed his knees, And then his glasses, to read clear this treason Against the feminine proprieties, And, in pure zeal, grown ‘instant out of season,’ For the girl's motives he began to teaze. She writhed and cut him short: ‘I have a reason— For God's love, Padre, question me no more; I'll tell you all, but let us get ashore.’ XXXIII And surely 'twas a little indiscreet, If one may charge a priest with indiscretion, With Tonio not two yards from off their seat, To urge the girl to such a frank confession. She glanced at Tonio as she spoke, and sweet Most certainly was not her eyes' expression! The Padre then was wide enough awake To see that he had made a slight mistake. XXXIV Poor Tonio, though, to do him justice, seemed As deaf as he was dumb. His cap was drawn Low o'er his brow; he looked as though he dreamed, And rarely raised his eyes. Meanwhile the dawn Had flown. Into the haze of heaven had steamed The mountain mists, as day came dancing on; And, his confessional titbit awaiting, The good man found the voyage quite elating. XXXV Like a great burst of singing came the day, After the dawn's soft prelude, from heaven's cave Swooping to clasp the billowy-bosomed bay In his ecstatic arms, wooing each wave To give him kiss for kiss. His glorious way Was pioneered by the brisk winds, which gave New life to the waking world, and filled each sense With measureless desire and hopes immense. XXXVI In short, it was a most delicious morn— What clouds there were soared in the upper sky, Or round the mountains died as they were born In the bright haze that clung mysteriously To the dim coast. An Amalthea's horn Of rathe delight seemed emptied from on high On all the progeny of land and sea— Shore-maidens sang, and sea-birds shrieked for glee. XXXVII There was a breath of fragrance in the air That stole upon the spirit like young love, An incense wafted from you knew not where— From thymy dell and seaweed-scented cove. Ocean and earth had found each other fair, And mingled their fresh lips—the tamarisk grove Sighed for the kiss of the wave, and waves leaped up To yield the winds dew for the myrtle's cup. XXXVIII 'Twas wondrous pleasant as the boat's light prow Danced o'er the brine to Tonio's measured strokes, And nearer, clearer rose the rocky brow Of the fair Isle. The Priest, though, scarce could coax From boy or girl a random answer now, Or civil smile, even, at his little jokes, And so grew silent, dying to discover Who, if love ailed the minx, could be her lover. XXXIX Small need for talk when breathing is delight. Before them, blind with sun, the shadowy isle Grew, changing like a vision; on the right, Far o'er the waves, lay Naples many a mile; And off to sea the tunny-fishers' white And gleaming sails basked in the morning's smile. All owned that sunny spell, that breezy zest, Claude best has caught—when Claude is at his best. XL At length they touched the ground; Antonio bore The Padre from the boat, and high and dry Set him with reverent care. A little sore Perhaps he felt when past him, holding high Bundle and boots, Laurella splashed ashore, Deigning him not a look, and sulkily Waited the Priest. To him he made his bow, And turned to haul his boat up, lighter now. XLI ‘Don't wait for me, Antonio, I must stay Here over-night,’ the Priest said. ‘O, but surely You must go back, Laurella?’ ‘Yes, if—’ ‘Eh?’ ‘If I can find a boat.’ She wrung demurely Her skirts; but frowned when Tonio, come to lay His oars upon the sand, said in a surly And careless tone, ‘I stay till Av' Mari’— Come then; if not, 'twill be all one to me.’ XLII ‘Yes, yes, your mother can't be left alone,’ The little man broke in—‘she'll go, she'll go— That's settled. Bless me, how the time has flown! Come, child, you want to speak to me, you know.’ He briskly led the way, and on a stone Under a sheltering bush the rocks below He took his seat. The girl before him stood, Biting a twig in most unquiet mood. XLIII ‘Laurella, you have something on your mind, Something that, breathed in your confessor's ear, May leave your heart the lighter. 'Tis unkind That name they call you; but I greatly fear You have a stubborn will. These whims, you'll find, Have cost your poor sick mother many a tear. She soon must leave you. Seems it not Heaven's plan That you should wed? Why scorn an honest man?’ XLIV Our good Curato, be it gently said, Had one sweet feminine idiosyncrasy. Celibate himself, if other folk must wed, His fingers itched to make their marriage-pie. Some gossip, too, had put it in his head That the girl's mother was certain (Heaven knows why) This painter with tall talk and big umbrella Would be the very husband for Laurella. XLV His ghostly words were kindly spoken. She Stood moodily, with strangely-working face, Her fingers writhing as she gazed to sea— Impatience, anguish, scorn in furious chase Wantoning through her breast. Then suddenly She turned upon him with a questioning gaze, While some wild storm of speech fought with her pride: ‘You did not know my father, sir,’ she sighed. XLVI ‘Your father? (rest his soul in Paradise!) Why, he's been dead these years. You can't have been More than—not ten years told, when last your eyes Looked on his face,—and now you're’—? ‘Just eighteen; He's nine years dead.’ ‘A fatto! And has this wise Resolve to do with him? Saints! how that keen Eye in his handsome face would sometimes glow! You're his live image often, do you know?’ XLVII Her irids 'gan to glow and to dilate With some fierce, tearless passion, which scarce found Way through her pale and twitching lips—some great And life-deep woe, that laid upon each sound Of her revealing voice its crushing weight, Seeming to strangle it, and to astound Her ears with alien accents: ‘It was he— O, he has killed my mother!’ answered she. XLVIII ‘Killed her!’ ‘Ay, killed her—beat her.’ Quick and deep Her breath came pantingly. ‘They never knew— I lay so still; they thought I used to sleep. But I saw all, heard all. What could I do, Gesu-Maria! but lie still and weep, And pray the saints that saw to make him rue? Those blows! they broke my heart—froze me claycold! The bedclothes weighed on me like churchyard mould. XLIX ‘Gran’ Dio, Padre! when you talk to me Of marriage—love—you fill my eyes and ears With horrible sights and sounds. She loved him, she Was Christ-like meek—had only prayers and tears For shield against his curses—strove to be Duteous in all, like the poor dog that fears His love may prove his fault. He beat her! O 'Twere shame to see a dog even beaten so! L ‘Then, when she fainting lay upon the floor, His mood would change, and he would hug her close And kiss her till she screamed. His blows she bore, But moaning, “Gesu!—Gesu mio!”—but those False kisses, those vile claspings that made sore Her breast with love's pretence, hurt more than blows, Murdering the holiest joys of love. And he Laughed when she cried, “O God, you smother me!” LI ‘Yet this she bore—forgave him everything! And why? Love made her tame; she loved him still, And when his sickness came, she all that spring Nursed him both day and night, though O so ill! And all through him. Since that vile suffering She has never held her head up—never will. He broke her heart, and before God I say 'Tis he has killed her if she dies to-day.’ LII With the last words her voice grew stern and strong, Like an accusing spirit's, and her eyes Half caught that strange expression which you long To fathom in the Cenci's—early wise In horror of such God-confounding wrong, As blots the gladness from youth's virgin skies; Her lips, too, half-recalled the Cenci's, wrung With agony too deep to find a tongue. LIII That patience dumb of sibylline despair Was not Laurella's, though; fierce she defied All tyranny, and everything would dare, Still feeling, somehow, Heaven upon her side. The good Curato heard her with the air Of one who ventures upon ground untried, Shook his round head, then scratched his tonsure, then Coughed, and began his homily again. LIV ‘My daughter, my dear child, your story's one To wring the heart, and much I feel for you; But now that your poor father's dead and gone, Why thus rake up his faults? It may be true— Is true, I fear—that this has told upon Your mother's health. But what can rancour do? Let bygones then be bygones. Think no more Of those sad times that make your spirit sore. LV ‘You're young, my dear, and youth is all too prone To judge the sins it cannot comprehend. Alas! we all have sins, child, of our own, Enough to sink us without Christ to friend. Think what forgiveness God to us has shown, And we the like to others should extend. Then, O Laurella, while your mother lives, Receive her heart—forgive as she forgives!’ LVI ‘Forgive!’ she cried, ‘ay, but forget, forget! Never! that horror lies upon my heart Like a stone on a flower—it cannot grow. I fret In vain against these memories. But I start In life as no man's slave; and durst one set His lips or hands on me, could make him smart— Not like my mother. Nothing e'er shall make Me so love man, so suffer for his sake.’ LVII ‘Tut, tut! when love knocks at a maiden's door He will not be denied. Your turn must come. Be just, be just. Must all men pay the score Of your poor father's faults? There's many a home Happier, thank God! than yours, many a mean floor Love makes a step towards Heaven; and surely some Such homes you must have seen. Why then suppose Your painter friend would treat his wife to blows?’ LVIII ‘Padre, I may be young, and little know Of the great world, and you are good and wise; But things like these put me in such a glow, I see God's blessed truth bare of all lies. You do not know that man you fancy so— Your goodness blinds you. Ugh! he made those eyes I've seen my father make when bent on cheating My mother to forget her latest beating. LIX ‘I know those eyes—bright with deceitful fire, And selfish, wolfish hunger. None shall dare Insult me with such eyes. No wheedling liar Shall make me tame with love. A man may swear A thousand oaths, and kiss till fancy tire, Yet kill the trustful thing that loves him. There, I've said my say. Ere love makes me a slave, May the sweet Virgin hide me in my grave!’ LX Her passion's tempest, finding vent at last, Raged itself out; its lightnings quenched in rain, For in her eyes the tears were gathering fast— She strove to stay them, but she strove in vain. The Priest was mute, though through his mind there past A murmuring host of maxims sage and sane; But none seemed quite adapted to the case— He could but sigh, ‘God send you greater grace!’ LXI The girl's fierce wrath he could not but withstand, Yet with a smile that left her bosom light, He blessed her as he rose. She kissed his hand, And so they parted, he going left, she right; He took his thoughtful way along the strand, She, like a goat, began to scale the height. Meanwhile poor Tonio watched her from his boat More keenly than he would have watched a goat. LXII She had gone, not deigning him one small good-bye, One little word of thanks, and there she went Up through the myrtles—never turned an eye, Pausing not once in all that steep ascent! At last, when clear she stood against the sky (Was it to rest, or did her heart repent?) She turned—their eyes met, and their faces flamed With some fond shame, whereof each felt ashamed. LXIII Tonio fell straight to work, and roundly swore That to her airs he would not dance a jig, Hastening to heave his oranges ashore, Calling himself a dolt, an ass, a pig! While, as she walked, Laurella's beauty wore Its most gorgonian armour. Not a fig She cared for this young fool. What did it matter If Tonio stared his eyes out gazing at her? LXIV They went their ways—Laurella toiling on By rocky paths, and sultry fields, where grilli Chirred in the grass, and brown bees hummed upon Sweet knolls of thyme and tufts of mountain-lily; While Tonio on his head bore, one by one, His baskets to the village, chanting shrilly A careless barcarole. And so, success Attend their labours!—who could wish them less? PART SECOND. I We scarce have breathed coy morning's odorous sighs, As her young bridegroom lifts her maiden veil, Ere she confounds us with her matron eyes And buxom cheeks—no more a virgin pale! Now—full-blown afternoon, august in guise, With vintage crowned—the morning of our tale Had lulled her lord in such a close embrace, Her glowing bosom hid his jovial face. II All nature took siesta—sultry sleep, Brooding in russet haze, had whelmed all things In fiery interfusion. On the deep The winds, like wearied gulls, with folded wings, Slept with the sleeping waves, which still did keep A breathing motion with low murmurings; Yet Tonio, broad awake, stood by his boat On the slow-heaving waters half-afloat. III Alone he kept his watch, his brow still bent Upon Laurella's path, in hunter's gaze Of most impatient patience, as he leant Against the prow, full in the blinding blaze; Save when at times with growing discontent He turned to watch the southward-gathering haze, Half angry with the ripplets, though they beat Their grateful coolness through his naked feet. IV The sea looked lovely as some siren thing, Feline and feminine, whose dumb repose Maddens to tempt its dangerous power, and cling To its dread bosom passionately close. Far off the filmed horizon's eastern ring Shone with a bronzéd purple, o'er which rose A hot mirage of mountains, looming there Like steadfast clouds just gathered out of air. V He felt it in his fashion; for he spurned Wave after wave, as each came fawning o'er His ankles, like a tiger's tongue; then turned, With a grim smile, gloomily to pace the shore. But all at once in his dark eyes there burned The fire of triumph: there she came once more— As though his gaze had drawn her from the abyss Of sightless fancy, to become its bliss! VI Perhaps his gaze was potent to compel From distant ways Laurella's petulant feet; She really moved as though some uncouth spell Dragged her reluctant steps the boy to meet. (What brought her there I never quite could tell, I mean in Tonio's boat of all the fleet; But now being brought, and having paid her fare, She clearly held a stake in ‘cette galère.’) VII She halted by the cliff, seemed half-inclined Again to vanish from Antonio's day— Made three steps back; then doubtless changed her mind, Walked towards the sea three-quarters of the way; Then paused again; while Tonio, who divined Her wavering, scarce knew what to do or say, But cried: ‘Come, let's get home before the storm! Unless you want to keep the fishes warm.’ VIII ‘Have you no other passenger?’ she said, Anxiously glancing toward the little town Some furlong o'er the sand. He shook his head. ‘Come, come—'tis late!’ With an embarrassed frown She turned away. ‘Who'll make your mother's bed If here you stay?’ he cried, and flung his brown And vigorous arms around her—fairly bore His prize aboard, and shoved in haste from shore. IX Here was a situation for the pair! Laurella, flushed and angry, not subdued, Though conquered, in the stern sat with an air Of loftiest abstraction from vain feud— A look like that a captive queen might wear In the scorned presence of her captors rude; And Tonio, somehow, felt himself, for all His brilliant coup de main, extremely small. X Women from even defeat can forge a chain To bind and captivate their vanquishers; For men are stupid creatures in the main, Though strong. Laurella gagged and fettered hers To his own oar with gyves of cold disdain— He trembled as he sat; could scarce immerse His oar-blades in the sea; sighed like a fool; And, hot and cold at once, tried to keep cool. XI She felt the sun, and, with hands trembling too, Kerchieft her head sedately from its shining; Then, with deliberate coolness, out she drew Her olives and brown bread, and fell to dining, Slicing the loaf daintily, as though it grew To luxury through her sharp knife's refining; While Tonio, touched to see this meagre meal, Tender protecting pangs began to feel. XII Rarely she raised her eyes—but to withdraw, Gazing beyond him, into privacy; Yet he could make no movement but she saw, Of all his moods as conscious as was he. His oars she soon heard pause. He stooped to draw From their rich nest, and offer bashfully, Three splendid oranges. ‘Take these,’ he said; ‘'Twill be a relish for your bit of bread. XIII ‘Dry bread is thirsty food. Don't think I kept them, Thinking of you. They're some I did not sell, So back into the basket here I swept them. Not bad ones though—just try how nice they smell.’ She deigned not even to touch, much less accept them, But proudly spoke her thanks. Said Tonio: ‘Well, Perhaps your mother—won't you take them to her? Would 'twere some greater service I could do her.’ XIV He reddened as he spoke; his wish to please Gleamed in his eyes' pathetic eagerness; Yet their soft beams but harder seemed to freeze Laurella's ice. This time she gave him less Than coldest thanks. ‘We have heaps as good as these At home,’ she said: ‘who fancies our distress A mark for stranger's bounties? For my mother I can provide, I hope, as well as another.’ XV ‘The Virgin dry my tongue up, if I meant The least offence!—and you might take them still, With my respects—do; tell her they were sent Just as a mark of kindness and goodwill.’ ‘She does not know you,’ said the girl, and bent Her brows more sternly. Tonio felt a thrill Of inward rage; yet bore it like a lamb, And meekly said: ‘You'll tell her who I am.’ XVI ‘I do not know you either,’ she replied, With languid sullenness, calm as a Fate Which, businesslike, sans triumph, haste, or pride, Cries to our foolish mortal hopes Checkmate! (This was the third time she had thus denied His bare acquaintance in set terms of late; The first being once while still the painter haunted her, When with poor Tonio's penchant he had taunted her.) XVII ‘Then you won't take them?’ ‘No.’ This downright blow Struck fire at last. ‘To the devil with them then!’ And overboard they went, to dance and glow Upon the glowing waves. Some mermaiden Robbed the devil of his due, for all I know, Ere the waves flung them to the shore again, Tribute returned. Laurella did not stir; Either was welcome to them, as for her. XVIII So sat they in this most unblest of boats, Like deadliest enemies; but first must fight Their hearts, which leaped like tigers at their throats, As though they meant to strangle them outright: Their traitor pulses, sounding dreadful notes, Besieged their bosoms with a fond affright; At their lives' doors some passion knocked like death— No wonder they felt rather out of breath. XIX Poor Tonio, raging like a wounded whale, With his two oars began to lash away, Blindly as that stupid monster with its tail, Till in Laurella's eyes he sent the spray. She would not heed; but let her fingers trail Over the side, as with the waves to play, Then on her cheeks her palms all cool and wet She softly laid, ignoring Tonio's pet. XX Her cheeks would burn, however, spite of pride And of cold water; and—she knew not why— She felt, though 'twould be most undignified, A huge desire to have one hearty cry; But with ‘that creature’ there she would have died Rather than shed a tear. He had filled her eye With some salt splashings of the outer ocean, But should not stir the unsailed brine of emotion. XXI Meanwhile the haze grew fire. Above the pair Brooded some elemental passion, pent Like thunder in the dungeons of the air, Which seemed to palpitate, as though there went Through it an unseen lightning. Floating there, They were alone with the vast discontent Of nature's ominous calm. The sun's own heart, Throbbing through theirs, its impulse did impart. XXII The sea was glassy calm—a tideless swell And windless ripple made it gleam and glance; But, in her dabbling, where the shadow fell Her mirrored face Laurella caught by chance. Her hair was tossed, she saw; she might as well Just set it right—'twere some deliverance From sheer constraint to smooth it and re-coil it; And so, in Tonio's teeth, she made her toilet. XXIII He did not seem to heed; but soon she heard His irritable oar-blades pause again: She felt some tempest more than common stirred The mounting billows of his mental main. He strove to speak, she knew, yet found no word; But something great was coming—that was plain. At last between his teeth she heard him hiss: ‘Per Baccho, I must make an end of this!’ XXIV ‘Laurella, wherefore should you use me so? If you have sworn to kill me, take that knife And cleave my heart at once. Well you must know I love you—love you ten times more than life. I'll bear these flouts of yours no longer. O, Are you too proud to be a poor man's wife? Give me some hope, or end me on the spot. A pin might goad me now to—God knows what!’ XXV His voice bespoke his earnest, with its wail Of passionate appeal. She raised her long Lashes at last, and grew a little pale; For men, though foolish creatures, yet are strong, And when their gusty passions mount to a gale, Will bluster o'er all barriers, right or wrong; But for the faintest soupcon of coercion Laurella had the most profound aversion. XXVI ‘I want no love of yours,’ she curtly said; ‘Mind your own business, and leave me to mine; I will not have your name, alive or dead, Tacked to my tail by gossips o'er their wine. I want no husband—have no mind to wed, You nor no other.’ ‘Ay, ay, mighty fine! You think so now,’ said Tonio, ‘but some day You'll know the worth of what you have thrown away. XXVII ‘O, for the love of Christ, for your own sake, Consider what you do; don't drive me mad! My heart's not much, God knows, for you to break— Though 'tis a man's who loves you, good or bad, More than his hopes of heaven; but sour you'll make The wine of your sweet life, your Angel sad. You want no love? Altro! I say the woman Who wants no love's a monster, and not human. XXVIII ‘Now you are young and wild, but some fine day, Alone and poor, as the world wags, you'll find Husband and home not bad things in their way.’ ‘Then,’ said Laurella, ‘I can change my mind. What's that to you, if so? Perhaps I may— There are more men than you. When I'm inclined, Heaven send me luck!’ ‘Cospetto!’ Tonio roared, And fiercely jerked his dripping oars aboard; XXIX Clearing his decks for action, as it seemed. Laurella wondered what was coming next— His face grew pale, and in his eyes there gleamed A dangerous fire, as past all patience vext. Perhaps he thought she of some rival dreamed, Pondering the jealous lover's favourite text. ‘Santissimo diavolo!’ he broke out, ‘You think I'll live to bear that too, no doubt? XXX ‘What's that to me, you say? What's that to me! O nothing, nothing! I must see you smile In some curst fellow's face—sit still and see Some simpering scoundrel win you with his guile; See your delusion his felicity, And feel myself in hell—hell all the while! No, by the saints! I tell you one small earth Can't hold us both—one must have narrower berth.’ XXXI If Tonio's blood was up, so was Laurella's. ‘How dare you talk to me like that? For shame! What right have you, I ask you, to be jealous, Though I should fancy the first fool that came? You show me you can stoop to threats, as well as The rest of your brave sex. What earthly claim Have you upon my life, that you should rave Against me thus? Promise I never gave. XXXII ‘Don't prate to me of love. I may be young, But I can reckon, better than you think, The worth of those sweet drops from a man's tongue, Which many a woman's ears greedily drink. You flatter fair, to trample us like dung Once we are won. I know you—hate you—shrink From wedlock bondage as I shrink from shame. What claim have you to me—I say what claim?’ XXXIII ‘What claim!’ he cried—‘one that is none less good Because engrossed by no curst lawyer's quill, But here by God's own hand, in my heart's blood, Which aches with longings you alone can still. O, as the eye craves light, the opening bud The dew of the morn, because 'twas God's good will To make them what they are, I faint for you— You are my noonday light, my morning dew. XXXIV ‘You are mine, I say, by that divine decree Which for all natural wants made sweet provision— For birds the air, sea for the fish, for me You, only you, by love's supreme decision. If any comes between us, you shall see My claim's no matter for the fool's derision. Let him beware, that's all; let him beware— The meekest may grow dangerous in despair!’ XXXV From her pale face her dark eyes flamed their scorn: ‘Yes, you're a man—your will's a law divine; Every man thinks so—but no man yet born By coward threats shall shake resolve of mine. I am free, and mean to keep so.’ ‘I'll be sworn,’ Cried Tonio, fairly drunken with the wine Of baffled passion, ‘I will tame you yet— Must two lives fail through a perverse coquette!’ XXXVI He leaped upon his feet and stamped with rage, Making her heart bound like a startled deer. ‘Here you shall do my bidding, I'll engage; You're in my power, Miss—I'm your master here.’ Laurella felt like one cooped in the cage Of some wild beast, and the cold touch of fear Crept o'er her cheek; yet with undaunted air She faced him: ‘You may kill me if you dare.’ XXXVII ‘Your blood be on your head,’ he groaned; ‘the sea Will hold us both! None ever so loved bride; But now—! O God, you have willed it—it must be! To-night we shall be lying side by side, Cold, but together. You have maddened me, And now, Christ pardon us!’ Then at a stride He came, as Death might—with pale, piteous face, To clasp some loved one in his chill embrace. XXXVIII He bent to seize her, but with startled cry Drew back. Without a word she had let him come; But the roused tigress does not tamely die— She had made her sharp white teeth meet in the thumb That grasped her; then flung off her enemy, Scared by her fierce rebellion, deep though dumb. ‘Now am I in your power,’ she cried, ‘or free?’ And, laughing wildly, leaped into the sea. XXXIX She sank, but rose again, and boldly spread Her arms upon the water—her long hair Loosed in the plunge, afloat behind her head, The wavelets rippling round her bosom fair. Sobered by shock, yet palsied half with dread, With neck outcraned, Tonio could only stare, As though God's blessed bread for sinners broken. Between his lips, against his sins, had spoken. XL Then, slapping his dank brow, he seized his oars, And in her wake rowed swiftly; though the blood From his torn thumb came ‘rushing out of doors, To be resolved if’ gentle creature could Inflict such wounds as that. The chase of course, Though a stern one, was not long—flesh against wood Had not a chance. He soon was at her side— ‘For God's sake come aboard again!’ he cried. XLI ‘Laurella, hear me! you may trust me now— Come in, come in, for our dear Lady's sake— I am mad no more, by all the saints I vow! O if you come to harm my heart will break! Hate me, but trust me. Come, and I'll allow You tie my wrists and ankles till they ache, Then fling me in the sea. I will not live To vex you—do not ask you to forgive.’ XLII She deigned no notice of this fond appeal, But for the distant shore swam bravely on, Going along easily as a little seal, Her bare feet through the water glancing wan. ‘Think of your mother—think what she will feel If you should sink,’ he said, ‘and, ere you have gone A third the distance home, you must go down— Yon land's two miles off yet—why will you drown?’ XLIII This was bare truth, she knew. She eyed the land Wistfully once; then, with a swelling throat, Swam up without a word. He stretched his hand To draw her in, but, clutching at the boat, She clambered o'er the gunwale, with a grand Last pride of independence. Tonio's coat Slipped, as his craft lurched with Laurella's weight, O'erboard, and went unrescued to its fate. XLIV Sullen she took her former seat, and wrung The water from her hair and clothing scant, Which, like thin drapery, classically clung To her lithe limbs and bosom all apant With its unwonted toil. Tonio had sprung Back to his oars when he could fairly chant His pæan for her safety—though the wood, Galling his hand, was crimson with his blood. XLV She saw the stain, and gave a little start, And, as when moved, (we know the habit), frowned; But some remorseful thought stirred in her heart— Tonio was maimed if she was nearly drowned. Promptly (as the French would say) she ‘took her part’— ‘Shew me your hand,’ she said, and deftly bound The wound up with her kerchief; took the oar, And, rowing stoutly, looked at him no more. XLVI Ah! but his blood—there was the shaft all red— She could not take her eyes off that; in fact, 'Twas clearly on her hands, if not her head. Awed by the vision of their reckless act, They rowed home pale and silent; neither said A word in answer when the boatmen cracked Their wanton jokes upon their strange appearance, Disdaining with such coast-guards to make clearance. XLVII O'er Procida the lurid sun, just setting, Flamed stormy portent from his blood-red eye, As they touched land. No worse for toil or wetting, Laurella found her garments nearly dry. She leaped ashore, but paused a moment, letting One little word, as Tonio passed her by Carrying a basket, from her proud lips fall— She merely said, ‘Addio!’—that was all. XLVIII And then away she ran, ere she had caught His answering ‘Buona notte!’ murmured low, With downcast eyes, and cheeks red with the thought That now in his disgrace she graced him so. Shouldering his oars, his lonely lair he sought, Like a beaten hound—with heavy steps and slow Mounting the stone stair to his little hut, Glad in the whole world's face his door to shut. XLIX At home once more with soothing solitude, His dingy chamber he began to pace, But paused before his Virgin carved in wood, Seven gilded stars around her smiling face. To her divine and pitying motherhood, Bereaved of joy, he dumbly looked for grace, While, from his heart o'erwearied, tears would rise, Veiling her glory, mist-like, from his eyes. L Ah, Dio, what a day! Our lives' true rate Not ticking clocks but beating hearts may measure, In dreams a moment swells with centuries' fate, And Love, the dreamer, in a day finds leisure For lifelong bale or bliss. Tonio with hate This long day lingering yet for his displeasure Saw through his tears, and dashed the shutter to; But could not shut Laurella from his view. LI Her bite, keen as remorse's, rankled still— His wounded hand throbbed hotly in its sheath. He loosed the bandage, and a little rill Of dolorous blood oozed slowly from beneath The swollen edges. With a curious thrill He viewed the red pits of the maiden's teeth— As lovers kiss Love's wound he kissed her bite. ‘I was a brute,’ he said. ‘She served me right.’ LII He washed the wound in water clean and cold, And bound it up once more—that eased the pain— Then mused awhile: To see her were too bold, But she must have her handkerchief again— Beppo should take it to her. He unrolled And washed it clean from every crimson stain. Well, she should ne'er set eyes upon him more, And yet—he never loved her so before! LIII Poor lad! slight loss of blood had left him weak To all appearance; for, his hectoring done, His mournful spirit waxed extremely meek, The stage of self-abasement now begun. He vowed, with tender tears upon his cheek, For her dear sake far from her face to run, In that wild rapture of renunciation For your young lover such a sweet sensation. LIV He kissed the precious cloth, and reverently Hung it to dry; then on his meagre bed Threw himself wearily with a deep-drawn sigh, And strove to think; but slumbered soon, instead;— Till some distracting noise bade slumber fly— 'Twas someone at the door! ‘Who's there?’ he said, Then rose to open, in no friendly mood, And—'wildering vision—there Laurella stood! LV Yes, it was she indeed—she and the storm, They had come together; for the lightning's glare Revealed against the night her slender form, And the first gust of the gale was in her hair. Without a word she entered; but the warm Blood to her cheek, at Tonio's wondering stare, Leapt, as she laid her basket down, drew breath, And faced him, like a martyr facing death. LVI ‘You are come to fetch your handkerchief,’ said he. ‘No need for that—you should have it clean, By Beppo's hands to-morrow, punctually.’ ‘No, 'tis not that,’ she panted; ‘but—I have been For herbs, to heal your hurt—up yonder—see!’ And off the basket's lid went. ‘What do you mean?’ He asked. ‘For me! Buon Dio, you're too good! I have got no worse than 'twas most just I should. LVII ‘My hand's all right—if not, I earned it all, And twice as much. This trouble is too kind— I see great drops of rain upon your shawl.’ (He had lit his lamp, which flickered in the wind, Though closed the door.) ‘Why come in such a squall? At such an hour? The neighbours are not blind, Nor dumb, confound them! Goodness will not balk Their gossiping tongues—you know how they can talk.’ LVIII ‘Who fears their tongues?’ she sharply asked. ‘Not I! I came to see your hand;’ and she unbound The linen swathes; but gave a shuddering cry, ‘Gesu-Maria!’ when she saw the wound. ‘Bah! there's some swelling,’ Tonio said, ‘but why Make all this work about it?’ Yet he found A blessed surgery in her soothing touch, And liked the operation very much. LIX She went about her business in such grave, Deft, motherly fashion, that her patient smiled For deep undreamed content; and mutely gave Himself to her tendance—like a naughty child, Outwearied and forgiven. Ah, could she lave That hand for ever thus! He felt exiled From new-found home, when, cooling herbs laid on, And drest the unfevered wound, she must be gone. LX ‘Thank you,’ he sighed, with a new rush of sadness ‘This favour is too great, yet makes me bold To ask another. O forgive my madness! Forget those words of passion uncontrolled I spoke to you to-day. Not downright badness Of heart it was, I hope—the thing got hold Of body and soul, in a shark's flash. But now I'll never vex you more—never, I vow.’ LXI Quite fiercely she broke out: ‘The fault was mine. Why do you beg my pardon? I'm to blame, And should beg yours. I took a wicked line, My crossness 'twas that made your anger flame. And then—that dreadful bite!’ ‘'Twas God's design To bring me to my mind. I bless His name, And thank you for it. It did me only good— Here is your handkerchief, clean of my blood.’ LXII He held it out to her; yet still she lingered, Dumb with some inward struggle. In the pause, Tonio, without, the wild wind shrilly sing heard, And grudged to trust her in the tempest's jaws. But something in her basket still she fingered— ‘I want you to take this,’ she said, ‘because You have lost your nice new jacket—all through me; Your purse as well—this is worth something—see!’ LXIII She drew a rosary forth, with silver beads And cross. ‘This was my aunt's—before she died She gave it me—and now my foolish deeds Have left me in your debt.’ He shrank aside As from a serpent. ‘No, no, no! What needs This talk? My loss is nothing.’ ‘O,’ she cried, ‘Think of your uncle's money—all gone down, Because—because you would not let me drown!’ LXIV Her earnest face flushed, and her pleading grew Almost a sob. ‘'Tis not enough, I know, But there is nothing that I would not do To make it up; while mother sleeps I'll sew, Or spin, or—’ Tonio groaned. ‘'Tis but your due,’ The girl persisted. ‘Due!’ he cried, ‘you owe Nothing to me, and nothing I will take. Why will you talk like that? My heart you'll break!’ LXV ‘No, no—forget me; if we chance to meet, For God's great pity look another way— Your eyes would make drop down in the street For very shame. But meet we never may— I'll leave the place. Forget me, I entreat, Or pardon me, when I am far away. There is your cross. No more you'll see my face. Good-night—good-bye, and thank you for your grace.’ LXVI Twitching the beads with fingers purposeless She stood, her eyes cast down; then let them drop Back in the basket—answering his address With silence; folded neatly on the top The handkerchief; then, why he could not guess, Kept fumbling with the lid; then seemed to stop Vaguely; and then—he saw, with huge surprise, That big round tears were raining from her eyes. LXVII ‘Madre Santissima! are you ill? (She'll fall!) Why do you tremble so? Here—take this chair!’ ‘No, no,’ she said, ‘not ill—'tis nought at all; But—I must go to mother—must have air.’ She staggered towards the door, but 'gainst the wall Leant feebly, with strong sobs that seemed to tear Her heart-strings. Then—arms out—she reeled to his breast, And weeping, blushing, close and closer prest! LXVIII ‘O,’ she sobbed out, ‘you give me good for ill— I cannot bear it! Beat me, trample me, Curse me—or—if—if you can love me still, Though why you loved me I could never see, Take me—for yours—do with me as you will; But send me not away so patiently! So coldly!’ All unused to women's ways, Tonio beheld this change with blank amaze. LXIX He held her arms—felt her wild heart Beat against his, and so found words at last: ‘Can love you still! Gran’ Dio! My blood would start From every vein, to wash away the past, If I could hope—ah, you but play this part To try me; or your pity runs too fast, And would betray your goodness! Do not waste Your life on me with this too generous haste.’ LXX But no—a woman knows her course too well When passion fills her canvas. Where Love's feet Touch land, she follows, be it heaven or hell, And burns her boats, mad to forestall retreat. Laurella raised her eyes, in his to dwell, And simply said, ‘Io t' amo!’ Strange and sweet That tearful look, bright with the touching splendour Of a proud woman's perfect self-surrender. LXXI He strained her to him with a choking sob, Humbled by his great triumph. ‘I'm your wife,’ She whispered; ‘take this earnest—none shall rob Your lips of this, my virgin kiss. For life— For death!’ She kissed him thrice. He felt the throb Of her warm lips on his, and like a knife A thrill of joy ran through him, feeling so Her beauty through his being melt and glow. LXXII Once won, he was not slow to take possession Of his sweet prize, and slake his lifelong thirst For love, joy, peace, now that by rich progression Blind discord into harmony had burst; But women kiss like artists by profession— Men are mere amateurs; and so at first, His lips untaught just failed his love to smother. Poor girl!—she bore it better than her mother. LXXIII There is a kiss of passion that would drain More of the soul than in mere lips can live, When lovers yearn for love, like babes that strain The mother's breast for more than it can give; Which kiss, not lightly to be kissed again, Soon lapsed into the kiss contemplative— The kiss of peace; and then Laurella's tongue Warbled new music from her heart that sung. LXXIV ‘Tonino mio! you love me then—can pardon My nasty cross-grained ways? O if you knew How I have feared to love you—set a guard on My thoughts, to vex you! Yes, my love, 'tis true— I feared to love you always—strove to harden My heart against you—you, you, only you! Ah that poor heart, you tugged it every way— You don't know how I hated you to-day! LXXV ‘But now, O now, I'll be so different! How could I bear to pass you, when we met, Without one look? And so you really meant To run away, and thought I could forget Your words of love? Ah, now you must relent— Must stay—to make me good! I'll never fret Your soul again—never!’ ‘O be my home,’ He cried, ‘and God forbid I e'er should roam!’ LXXVI And so in deep communion, breast to breast, They stood, their sweet love-language, like a song, Murmuring between, while, just to mark each rest, Light fluttering kisses to their lips would throng. Laurella in his arms, her blissful nest, Grew lovelier every moment, as more strong The new, sweet concords through her bosom swept— Till, for mere ecstasy, he could have wept. LXXVII For women are like roses—love, their sun, Awakes their hearts from some dull winter's trance, Their crimson petals opening one by one To bounteous richness in his radiance. Laurella's odorous blooming had begun— Tonio might thank the saints! With pleading glance At last she sighed: ‘Now I must go—'tis late— Your hand needs rest—good angels on you wait!’ LXXVIII With one last kiss she went. Her dainty waist Slid from his clasp. ‘No, no, you must not come— The rain's just over now. I love to taste A night like this—the moon will see me home. I fear no man but you.’ And out she raced Into the storm. He saw the billows foam Behind her, as she turned to smile: ‘Addio! Think of your hand, for my sake, Amor mio!’ LXXIX He was alone; but the sweet warmth of her Was in his arms, and heart, and the deep wells Of life. His blood was gay; his pulse astir With that tumultuous triumph which rebels Against the tyrant fates, to spur, spur, spur, On to the immortal victories faith foretells! Conflict he craved. Plague on this crib confined! Abroad he rushed, to buffet with the wind. LXXX The thunder had gone by, and growled afar Among the mountains; following in its course, The rain rushed after; but the wind made war Upon the sea; the sea, with rage grown hoarse, Tore at the beach. Above, with scarce a star, The moon fought with the clouds, which in mute force Drove on her by battalions—like a bark That rides and rives huge billows looming dark. LXXXI He paced the roaring beach, with a wild bliss To wrestle with the tempest. O to feel Its might on breast and limb; to hear the hiss Of the salt surges, mark them rave and reel Around his feet! 'Twas grand to feel all this, And know himself a man—to plant his heel On all things base! The world was at his feet, And love had made the world so new, so sweet! LXXXII But with our good Curato we began, With him must end. He heard a strange confession Some few days thence, which left the worthy man Tapping his snuff-box with benign expression; A maiden's 'twas—indeed none other than Laurella's own, which put him in possession Of some important facts about the present State of her soul, as wonderful as pleasant. LXXXIII ‘Oimè!’ he chuckled, ‘what a minx it was To lead us such a dance! An hour ago I hoped to plead humility's mild cause With my poor homilies; but who may know The ways of God? Love laughs at our wise saws. The girl's right—likely lad, this Tonio; The uncle, though, will take it much in dudgeon. Well, we must reason with the old curmudgeon. LXXXIV ‘Ay, la Rabbiata, we must change your name— We'll better it now, please God! Well, well, how soon The Lord in wisdom has seen meet to tame This wild and wayward bird to sing love's tune! Hey, la Rabbiata? Bless me, when she came, Looking as lovely as a rose in June, I scarcely knew her! Well, well, God knows best— May His continual blessing on them rest!’ THE DAUGHTER OF HIPPOCRATES. A LEGEND OF COS. Whilome—when still the world's great heart was young, Making wild music as the minstrel sung; When still fair creatures of the poet's dream Haunted each legendary grove and stream, And still the pallid shades of throneless gods Lingered in wrath around their loved abodes, Ere from their shrines all awe was past away— In Sicily a Norman King bore sway. And on a day from that delightful isle There sailed a ship for Smyrna—many a mile Of treacherous sea to compass, many a night To battle with the winds, ere hove in sight The snows of Tmolus, and they furled her sails Securely in the gulf. Right costly bales Waited her coming; yea, a goodly prize Had been that vessel with her merchandise— Great pearls, and antique gems, and rare perfumes; Tissue of silver; webs of Indian looms Or Persian, glowing like their orient skies With woven gold and deep imperial dyes. Fair blew the wind as gay they sailed for home, But on the second day in sudden foam Leaped the Ægean billows to the blast Of the fierce-rushing North; whereon they cast Their heaviest lading overboard, and wore The shuddering ship; and fearfully before The ever-threatening surge two days they ran With bare and groaning spars. Then first began The storm to slacken; but they nothing knew Where they were driven, for none of all the crew Could surely name the land which rose to crown The sick-eyed hopes that saw the gale go down: Howbeit they anchored in a quiet bay At evenfall, and waited for the day. Joy to those storm-tost mariners! The dawn Revealed a land where many a pleasant lawn Sloped greenly to the white and shelving shore, Where lazy breakers tumbled with a roar Of bygone tempest. From the circling hills The mists rose, and they saw the gleam of rills Which headlong leaped in flashing waterfalls, And dark yews clinging to the rocky walls, And in the valleys many a stately tree, And all fair things thriving deliciously. Joy to those storm-tost mariners! O bliss, To stretch their numb and wearied limbs in this Undreamed-of Paradise! They pushed ashore Gleefully all, and none, I ween, forbore His jest or song, as each man filled his cask Or sluiced his salt-sore face. 'Twas joy to bask On the white shingle; for the brisk sea-air Was filled with living sunshine, and all care Was lifted from their hearts. A wooded glen Enticed them from the beach, and gently then Emerged upon a lawny solitude, Kept secret from the sea by sheltering wood. There centuried cedars and great fig-trees made In the hot noon broad tents of placid shade, And vagrant vines and gourds wove pleasant bowers— Lairs of cool grass, whereby sun-loving flowers Breathed all around. The sultry hum of bees Boomed in the dreaming air; but in the trees The birds were hushed for heat, and did not sing. The languid wind that set heath-bells aswing, Stirred with its wings such incense of wild thyme, It seemed the wafture from a tropic clime. At every step they roused some startled thing, Which gazed at them a moment, wondering, Then bounded from its browsing up the slopes, Off to the hills—wild goats or antelopes; But sign was none that ever man had come To make in that sweet solitude a home. Thereat much marvelling, they wandered on, Gay as the myriad butterflies. Anon They came upon a steeply-rising ground, And, mounting on through laurel thickets, found A broad space of rank grass, where thistles tall, Brambles, and burs pushed through the ivied wall Which still made crumbling shift to fence it in. It seemed an ancient garden; for some sin, In ages past committed, surely curst. The leprous fruit-trees knelt to quench their thirst About a stagnant pool; and nettles rank And nightshade revelled o'er each mound and bank, As in an ill-kept graveyard. Here and there A satyr face grinned leeringly in air, Fallen from its mossy pedestal; awry And totteringly still stood the Termini; And in the centre rose a marble Pan From a festooning vine which overran His goatish thighs, and on his lifted arm Hung its deep-purpling clusters. What grave charm Locked every lip, when mid the trees a pile Of melancholy marble, whose proud style Made boast of bygone splendour, came in view? I know not; but in silence paused the crew Before yon central wonder of the place, Gazing on that dumb dwelling in amaze— On the serene Greek sculptures of the frieze, Chaste-cut entablatures, and traceries Where Æsculapian snakes gordianing twined; On mystic symbols wondrously designed, Time-mouldering plinth, and ruined portico, And grass-grown steps—well worn ages ago! It seemed a lonely palace of the dead Guarded by silence; and a ghostly dread Fell on them, even when at times a hare Took fright and scampered to its grassy lair: For there were hares in legions—strangely tame, They sat to watch the men, and went and came Through the high classic doorway. Suddenly A sailor, pale with terror, whispered, ‘See!’ And clutched his Captain's arm, and turned to go. Then to their anxious question, what could so Have shaken him, he only answered, ‘There! That window! Look! 'Tis gone; but I could swear I saw the thing!’ Each felt a secret pang Shoot cold to the roots of life; and feebly rang The fear-born laugh flouting their comrade's fear; But, seeing naught, they mocked his altered cheer With ready jest: ‘'Fore God, it seems the place Turns men to marble—look but at his face! What thing is this? Hast seen a ghost?’ But he, Beckoning a youth who gazed, said tauntingly, Yet with a timorous eye, which roved in vain The horror it had known to meet again: ‘Now, Sieur Gualtier, if your heart be stout, Prove it; for here you may, past touch of doubt. Here stand the lists pitched for that valorous deed You oft have sighed to seek—God be your speed! And ye, who look so bold, see out the play— The Devil make me an ass if here I stay! Come, come—we stand upon enchanted ground: I know it now, Christ keep us! we have found That spot of Cos where dwells—what scarce I dare To name—O Queen of Heaven, look there, look there!’ They looked. A sudden pallor blanched each cheek, And not a man had power to move or speak; For there a hideous serpent raised its head, And gazed upon them keenly with its red And fiery eyes, and stretched its squamous neck Horribly towards them—every lustrous speck And lurid circlet glittering in the sun With hateful splendour. And they could not run, But spell-bound stood. The monster raised its crest Sharply as might a heron, eager lest The prey should 'scape, with little backward jerks; And so stayed keenly gazing—all the cirques Of its tremendous length yet coiled within. Then with weak knees they struggled to begin Their trembling flight. But Gualtier did not fly; The glittering mazes of the serpent's eye Wrought in his brain, like some Circean wine, With a delirious joy. He felt divine As Adam with the juice sweet on his lips, And wisdom's day new-burst from its eclipse, Eve glowing at his side. All dreams he had dreamed Of love and fame grew quick in him. He seemed No common sailor, by his noble air And rich though sea-stained dress. A young Trouvère He was indeed, who came with them along, Seeking adventures or new themes of song; And now fame hovered near. Stung to dare all, He firmly turned, his comrades to recall; ‘Friends, 'tis a gentle creature, as men say, And these tame hares bear witness—let us stay.’ ‘Stay then,’ replied the Captain; ‘try your fate With your tame snake. Come, men! Good fortune, mate— Keep your mad bones unpicked to dream on.’ Then Gualtier was left alone. He looked again— The snake had vanished. Like an evil dream Drawing to its final horror all did seem. Irresolute he stood, in act to fly; Yet, with a fearful courage, eagerly His heart leapt for the proof. There comes a time For each man when his nature stands sublime In one stern moment's light, when all his past Blossoms in one instinctive act. At last Death witnesses the bond with fortune sealed. Even thus the whole man Gualtier stood revealed: His life was full in blossom. There he stood, The chivalrous passion tingling through his blood, Yet half-faint, agonising on the tense Of expectation. By all gates of sense The scene infixed itself upon his soul. In an eternal present glowed the whole Charmed garden in the hush of high mid-noon; The feverous hum of bees and creaking tune Of myriad crickets thronging through the grass Boomed in his ears; but all things seemed to pass In the dim background of his mind. Then came A sudden rustling, and those eyes of flame Burnt at his very feet. It was too late For flight—he sickened in the grasp of fate; And a cold shiver stirred his rising hair. Trembling, yet with a heart that bayed despair, He gazed upon the cruel-fangèd jaws That fawned around him, making gentle pause As though to win his pity. Awed he spake: ‘In the name of God, what art thou?’ Then the snake Answered him in a human voice—none less Appalling for its feminine slenderness: ‘Hast thou not heard of me?’ He made essay, With dry and tuneless tongue, to stammer, ‘Yea, Thou art—the fearful Thing of Cos!’ Again The monster spoke, writhing as if in pain, And its voice shook: ‘I am that loathly thing.’ Then it was dumb; but every lurid ring Swelled with a passionate grief, which seemed at last To tear itself a way, as fierce and fast Words followed words: ‘Ay, thou hast heard my tale— Thy ears have heard; but how shall I assail With this chill tongue thy heart? How shall my woe Plead there in sacred human guise? Yet O Believe, believe, I was not always barred By this dread prison from my kind's regard! Not always was I thus—a thing to flee!— Teach the clear eyes of thy just soul to see Beneath this husk of hideousness a form That hath moved men to love—a bosom warm With more than woman's tenderness—a heart Where passions, pent for centuries, ache to start Into wild life. O dost thou long for love? How I could love thee—with a strength above All that thy dreams—nay, woe is me, I rave!— Love hissed upon this tongue moves loathing! Brave As thou art proved, that were a dream too dread. Yet mercy, mercy! Since thou hast not fled, Save me—be pitiful! Ah, was ever fate More piteous than mine, whom Dian's hate— Think of it—tortures thus, age after age? That tale is true; my father was the sage Hippocrates! How measure you the years That have remoulded nature since his tears Fell, unavailing as his prayers, for me? Since the fierce gods, in vengeful cruelty Cursing the issues of my mortal breath, Bound me to hateful life? No nearer death For aging all the long, long century through, I cast my slough, my hideous youth renew— Ah, think, think, think of it, and save me! O Salve with a moment's pang this age-long woe! Cancel this curse of Dian—laid on me Until—’ Her keen eyes sparkled horribly, Her jaws dilating as she raised her crest At once eagerly upward to his breast. ‘O gentle youth, kiss me upon the mouth!’ Shuddering, he started back—a deadly drouth Parching his tongue, and all his flesh a-creep With a damp chill. The serpent seemed to weep, For twice he heard a piteous inward groan; Then down she grovelled, with a sobbing moan, Upon the ground; a wailing smote his ears, As when a woman weeps, and warm large tears Sprang in her eyes and bathed her loathsome cheek. Gualtier was moved, and said: ‘What boots to speak, O Lady—if thou lady art indeed— Of curse of that false goddess, whom our creed Holds for a devil? 'Tis a thing of naught. I cannot kiss thee!’ At the sickening thought Such charnel savours to his palate rose As presage oft a swoon, and death drew close, With icy fingers clutching at his heart. He shook them from him, crying, with a start That caught the flying life: ‘But I will sign Thy forehead with that pledge of love divine— The Cross of Christ our Lord; and in His name I bless thee!’ All her colours went and came Marvellously,—then, pale for drearihead, She turned her from him droopingly, and said: ‘The Cross, the Cross! Alas! so talk they all, Pouring its blood on the fair world in gall; Cold hearts to fashion's pearls turn pity's tears; Sweet can he sing of love divine who fears To wear love's earthly thorns; ease would be kind, Ruffling no feather. Deem'st thou canst find In holy sign quittance from holy deed? Can blessèd names disfever wounds that bleed For tender hands? Not so, by Him who died!’ Sharply in Gualtier's eyes, with wonder wide, From her deep orbs she flashed indignant fire. Her words stung like a scourge. Then, lifting higher Her crested strength, she spoke again: ‘This curse A thing of naught! O what a cloud perverse Hangs in the heaven of thy fair sympathy! I tell thee 'twas my sin, though none in thee, That I denied this goddess. I was made The hated thing I am, because I paid No worship at her altars. Hated? Lo! So past all hate, that thou, who seest my woe, In pitiless loathing wilt redungeon me Where love and joy, like wailing spectres, flee My passion's clasp; where on the iron door Wan hopes beat out their lives for evermore! O foulness, foulness, with what mortal blight Thou nipp'st my womanhood's grace! Thy gorgon sight Chills men to marble gods, whom beauty's tale Had found refreshing rivers. Hence with that pale And comfortless face of thine!—for my despair Has dreadful promptings, which this moment tear My breast like tigers. Hence I charge thee—fly! Fair as thou art, I would not have thee die; But misery breeds fell brood—a tyrant thought Shakes all my feeble soul, long overwrought With passion self-represt, and I could well— Nay go! I will not harm thee.’ Then she fell A-weeping in contorted agony; And Gualtier, filled with wonder thus to see Her sorrowing rage for cruelty confest, Felt such a fascination in his breast As a man feels when hideous temptings rise To an abhorrèd sin. He kept his eyes Fixed on her writhing neck, and clutched his sword, Ready to strike. But now she turned her tow'rd Her palace, with a passionate shriek of: ‘Go!’ Then Gualtier spoke again: ‘How can I know Thou dost not lure me to some dreadful doom— Death—or a death-in-life of spell-bound gloom, With thee, for ages in this charmèd isle? I pity thee—yet—I fear thy serpent guile.’ Thereat she slowly rose, swelling her height Like a majestic wave; serener light Gleamed in her eyes, and in her voice awoke A grand and mournful music as she spoke: ‘O green and happy woods, breathing like sleep In quiet sunshine! Living things that creep, Or run, or fly amid these glades in peace! O earth! O sea! O heavens, that never cease Your gentle ministry, witness my truth! Must every word that melts man's heart to ruth, Move grim suspicion and the fear of lies? O powers of nature, grand benignities Of all this dumb creation! must the clay That shades our delicate lamp from the fierce day Of boundless life, lie on us like a mound Of graveyard earth, that shuts us from the sound Of all the kindly world, smothers our pale And struggling lips, and makes our feeble wail Come strangely to men's ears, like a ghost's cry? My voice appals? Alas! 'tis one deep sigh To be made lovely by one loving act; Yet he who hears leagues me in horrid pact With nether powers of ill. Farewell, thou fair Dream of a man, who comest, like despair, To torture me in happy human shape. Man's faith is not like woman's—nought can 'scape His sceptic fears—not faith itself—farewell! Thy doubts did ice the tender founts that swell Here in my breast a moment; but once more They gush as warm as tears. My passion's o'er— I blame thee not. Farewell, and happy be; But in thy distant world remember me!’ Two frisking hares just then came racing by; Starting from Gualtier, they couched timidly Among her serpent coils. She bent her head And licked them gently, weeping. Gualtier's dread Changing, chameleon-fashion, as her mood Took tenderer lights, had grown less deadly-hued, Shot through with pity's colours. All his powers, Like stripling soldiers whom the first stern hours Of battle veterans make, now burnt to dare That final grip with danger which did scare The vanward fancy; like a captain now, Who stares across the field with resolute brow, He rallied them, as with a trumpet-call Sounding to desperate charge. ‘Stand I or fall, O Christ,’ he murmured, ‘whom the wormy grave Held three days in its womb, us men to save From our corruptions, I will follow thee Even to the death! Shed now thy blood in me, To save this soul and mine!’ Aloud he spake, And shuddering closed his eyes: ‘I'll kiss thee, snake!’ And held his lips out, thinking on His name Who cast, when she besought him in her shame, Seven devils out of Mary Magdalen; And with the cross he signed himself. O then In his blind agony he seemed to sink In a cold sea of horror. He must drink The cup of loathing to the very lees. He felt the kiss approaching by degrees— That venomous toad-mouth, with its clammy chill; Now!—now!— It came at last. A sudden thrill Ran through his frame. A soft mouth fast and warm Was prest on his—about his neck an arm Clung rapturously. He looked, and, O surprise! O transport! gazed into the sweetest eyes That ever made a heaven for mortal man. It was too vast revulsion—faint and wan, He sank upon the ground. The hares had fled That sudden apparition in the stead Of the familiar creature of their love: For there a beauteous woman bent above The swooning youth, and kissed his eyes and hair, And lips, and brow; and chafed with tender care His languid hands, and to her bosom prest; And, motherlike, cherished his feeble breast With the glad warmth of her own; and made ado To stir his fluttering heart with pulses new From hers, which yearned to pour its blood for him. O happy Gualtier, through whose senses, dim And winter-chill, her glowing summer played! Thrice-happy Gualtier, with so sweet a maid To kiss him back to life! For she was fair As virgins are; her cheek and bounteous hair Had drunk the sunshine from the rising day And gave it back in beauty; the glad play Of youth was in her limbs; and all her form Kept its auroral curves, as though the storm Of agony had never swept the shore Of her lone life. But never virgin wore Brows of such ripe love-wisdom; virgin eyes Ne'er held in their grave deeps such mysteries Of sorrow and love; never did virgin lips Kindle and quiver to their tender tips With such rare smiles, wherein transfigured pain Grew love. Thrice-happy Gualtier, when each vein Ached with new-flowing life, and he awoke Nested in home-like peace! Wondering he spoke: ‘Mother of God, do I behold thy face? And am I snatched, through Christ's exceeding grace, From hell to heaven? O if it be a dream, Let me not wake!’ With a low tuneful scream Of laughing joy she caught him to her breast: ‘O let me be thy heaven, thy haven of rest, As thou art mine! 'Tis I, thy ransomed—I Who cling so close. These lips thou wilt not fly? O tell me I am loved—at last, at last— And make me all thine own! My slough is cast— Call me Aglaïa, give me back my name— That too! Ah! was this snake so hard to tame, Who, coiling ever closer, burns to be Thy home, thy bride, thy happy snake—by thee Restored to love—and death!’ Long did they live, and long from every land Thronged to them annually a pallid band Of sick folk, by their hands to be made whole; For, as was blazed abroad, they had control Of all diseases—skilled in secret lore And occult arts; and ever more and more Their fame grew loud, and of their wondrous cures, And wealth, and charities, the noise endures Even to this day in Cos, their island home. THE LOST VIOLIN-THEME. I. In the waning-time of the autumn We sat in the dusk—we three; On glasses emptied of Rhine-wine, The fire gleamed fitfully. Ghostly and huge our shadows Went wavering over the wall, And hushed by the Twilight-Spirit, Silence possessed us all. II. We heard but the tranquil flowing Of grand old Father-Rhine, And the wailful coming and going Of wind through the aisles of pine. We sat in the dusk and pondered, Each lone with his lonely heart, Ah! when shall we meet, we wondered, We three, whom to-night must part? III. At last when between the pine-trees The moon rose large and red, Up started Fritz from his musing, But never a word he said, Never a word; but sighing He past to his room within, And a voice rang clear through the twilight, The voice of his violin. IV. We knew it well:—it had thrilled us A thousand times or more; But now! what fine transport filled us? It never spake thus before! It came like a revelation, That shrill, small, passionate voice, Sublimed in its exaltation, Wild woes—ineffable joys. V. Keen bliss ran shuddering through us, And anguish of deep delight, On wings of the great Tone-Angel Our spirits were rapt that night. No awful beauty of dawning, No tender freshness of morn, No solemn glory of sunset, No sweetness of stars new-born, Nor grandeur of calm-crowned mountains, Nor river's majestic flow, Nor balmy sadness of pine-woods, Recall that adagio! VI. It rose, as a quaint arch rises, In curves of delicate strength; In languor of sweet surprises It sighed itself out at length. And then for one golden moment The silence alone we heard, And tranced in that blissful moment, We neither spoke nor stirred. VII. Anon, like a sudden tempest That swoops upon silent trees, In moonless glades of the forest, With shriek of strange agonies, The wrath of his terrible bowing Made vocal the strings within; It moved us, beyond things human, The wail of that violin! VIII. What demon possessed its master? What madness wrought in his brain, As, whirling faster and faster, The senses reeled to the strain? No nightmare-ridden, who, clinging O'er some infernal abyss, Grows dizzy with deathful singing, Half hearing the snake-fiend's hiss; No lover who stands death-stricken At sight of his lady's death, E'er felt all his soul more sicken Than we, as we held our breath. IX. But ever, above the rushing And agony of the strings, There soared a strain, like the rainbow That over a torrent springs,— A strain like that transient iris Which gleams and again grows pale, But wavers not from its poising However the hues may fail. X. At first it was but a yearning, Half-lost in the fierce unrest, Returning and still returning, Unshattered and unreprest— So pure, so ghostly, so tender, So fraught with delicious tears, So full of unearthly splendour, 'Twill live in our dying ears; Returning and still returning— Was ever a strain like this For sadness of infinite yearning, For fervour of infinite bliss? XI. At length, waxed brighter and brighter, It filled our hearts with its light; The whirl of that terrible music No longer could vex the night, Crescendo and still crescendo, Outraying joy through the gloom, It blazed to its ultimate triumph, Then Fritz came back from his room. XII. And we? I scarce durst greet him, So rapt was his face, so pale; But Gottfried sprang up to meet him With ‘Ruler of spirits, hail! Great master, come and be chidden; He merits no less, I vow, Whose bushel so long has hidden Such light as we wot of now!’ XIII. And Fritz sat down in the moonlight: ‘To-night we three must part— And a drear voice whispers, “Forever!” The voice of my boding heart; But ere we take leave forever, Fill round to old Father-Rhine, And list to the wonderful story Of this wonderful theme of mine. XIV. ‘In the Schwarzwald beside a river A lonely cottage stood, The river rolled by forever, Above waved ever the wood; And there in the gloom of the forest Was born a bright-haired boy, Through whom, when their need was sorest, Two hearts were made one in joy. XV. ‘And there in the haunted forest He lived and grew strong—that child, His masters the frank wood-spirits, His playmates all glad things wild. Self-weaned from his mother's kisses, He roamed all day like an elf, With song, and shouting, and laughter, Or silent, lay by himself, Deep-hidden beneath the pine-trees, In trances of blissful awe (Some folk say hearing and seeing What none ever heard or saw). But hugely he loved at twilight To climb on his father's knees, Or sit at his mother's footstool, Discoursing them mysteries: Then often some brave old Volkslied, Flung free in three careless parts, Would tell how throbbed in their cottage That trio of happy hearts. XVI. ‘But soon the kind years brought him Their seasons of joy supreme, When his sun-burnt father taught him His wood-craft of glade and stream: And down the mysterious river They rafted it, down and down, New wonders sailed by forever, And then the long-dreamed-of town! And there, blest beyond all measure, New life stirred the life within; There found he a fairy-treasure— God gave him a violin! XVII. ‘Years passed—his innermost nature Was known to those haunted trees; In rapture of earnest music He poured his soliloquies— All anguish of aspiration, All passion of deep love-dreams, All throes of the virgin spirit Took form in fantastic themes. XVIII. ‘'Twas autumn. At twilight falling His hair with strange awe was stirred; Faint whispers, low voices calling, Soft sighing of harps he heard: With shuddering of heart and swelling, He followed their ghostly guide, Till far from his father's dwelling He stood by the river-side. Sullen the clouds were rolling Away from the chilly west, Nought tendering and nought consoling Brought peace in the vague unrest; But all was pallor and bleakness— A menace—a phantom dread— A mockery of his weakness Hung hatefully o'er his head. XIX. ‘And filled with despair and yearning, And choking with unshed tears, He longed for death that might hide him From horror of coming years; Till sternly, as in defiance, He lifted himself from woe, And poured to God in his torment That solemn adagio. XX. ‘Sudden the deeps of heaven Were full of splendour and sound; Outleapt the might of the levin, The thunders were all unbound. O the fierce bliss of lightning Which spirits heroic know! Through fingers tingling and tight'ning It wrought in his fiddle-bow. Death-pale with sublime self-scorning And impulse of warrior-glee, As Jacob wrestled till morning For blessing, so wrestled he: But none ever knew what vision He saw in that holy place— Thereafter his dreams Elysian Were filled with one woman's face. XXI. ‘Years passed. He wandered—still wandered, But never in joy or pain, For thinking, or longing, or striving, That music would come again. He wandered abroad—still wandered, Impatient, from place to place, In search of that long-lost music— In search of that ne'er-found face. XXII. ‘It came at last—the fruition Of years of sorrow and toil— The world had its one musician, Too pure for the world to spoil;— It came—that face! Its divineness Made heaven in the concert-room; Half languid in lone benignness Those pure deep eyes of his doom! O this fierce bliss of lightning, How sings the blood in its glow! Thro' fingers tingling and tight'ning It wrought in his fiddle-bow. His love, at last! He had found her! Outleaped that theme like a flame, And fast in its love-spell bound her: His bride was his crown of fame. XXIII. ‘That bride, O friends, was my mother, My father that child of light, That mystic theme was none other Than that ye have heard to-night. That strain was his swan-song dying (Once more to our dear old Rhine!) My father's’—he ended, sighing,— ‘Who knows but it may be mine?’ XXIV. And so we took leave forever— Fate spoke in his boding vein, For never on earth, O never, That theme shall be heard again! II.—MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. SPRING SONG. Spring, Spring, sweetest Spring, How shall I give thee welcoming? When thy blue eye peeps from the sky, Larks must sing, and so must I! Primrose-time and cowslip-time Have had their echoes in my rhyme; But the first bright days that give Frost-nipt violets leave to live, And, the hedgerows brown between, With seldom daisies prank the green; Days that set clear streamlets glittering, And the keen-eyed sparrows twittering, That make the grass grow in the lanes, And breathe sweet change o'er hills and plains, Zoning with opal the grey sea— How full of budding bliss they be! But be they foul or be they fair, Thy odorous breath is in the air— Glad am I, ask me not why, Larks must sing, and so must I! MADRIGAL. When primroses begin to peer, Though distant hills be capped with snow, And one stray thrush will carol clear To snowdrops drooping all a-row; When building rooks caw as they pass, And the sun gleams o'er misty plains, Or melts the hoar-frost from the grass, The blood runs brisker in the veins. Then hey for the spring! when the sweet birds sing; Both lads and lasses love the spring. When sunshine fills the keen March air, And rain-flaws whirl across the lea, And the day veers from foul to fair, And the sap runs in every tree; When clouds go floating far and near, And colt's-foot buds in miry lanes, And all things feel the spring o' the year, The blood runs merrier in the veins. Then hey for the spring! when the sweet birds sing; Both lads and lasses love the spring. CÄCILCHEN AT THE PIANO. ‘She drew an angel down.’ I. Sat a maiden playing In the twilight lone; Through the window straying Went the music's tone. II. In their gleeful labour Fast her fingers flew Through some piece of Weber, Fiery, strange, and new; Valse, or quaint toccata, Rondo, fantaisie, Saraband, sonata— At them all went she. III. Spells Mozart and Haydn Wrought in moods of power, Kept this pretty maiden Idling for an hour; Themes that shook Beethoven In the dusk she played, (Which the little sloven Murdered, I'm afraid). IV. Hark a step! How wide her Blues eyes open can! In three strides beside her Stands the queerest man, Silent, quaint in vesture, (How small hearts can beat!) With imperious gesture Waving her from her seat. V. She with awed amazement Silently obeys; Slamming to the casement, Down he sits and plays. VI. What her flippant fingers Dashed at anyhow, On the ear it lingers Ravishingly now. In another fashion Speak the rushing keys— What immortal passion! Surging harmonies, Melodies how tender, Tones beyond all words, Tempest-bursts that render Up the ghost in chords; Music's rapturous ocean Billowing through the room, Mysteries of emotion Sighing in the gloom. VII. Spell-bound sat the maiden, Gazing o'er the sea Blankly, while he played, in Deepest reverie, Till, by silence startled, Quick she raised her eyes, When no more his art held Speechless with surprise. With an eager question Turned she. He had flown— At the freak's suggestion, Like a ghost was gone! VIII. So she sat in wonder, Musing in the gloom, When the tuneful thunder Lone had left the room; Then her heart beat faster, And her cheek grew hot; ‘Lo, it was the Master, And I knew him not!’ HYMN FOR A MAY MORNING. I. The awakened Earth, whom now fresh fingered May Chaplets with flowers and living leaves, is dancing Through odorous dew, to welcome the young day In melody from the gates of dawn advancing; Each moment, breathing rathe deliciousness, Flies forth an airy herald, nothing coy To utter its glad tiding, and possess Things winter-pined with tale of Spring's success— New victories of life and light and joy! II. Wide are the blissful chambers of the sky, Ranged by blithe-wingèd winds! The blue abyss of heaven, sweet as an eye Instinct with vigilant love, tenderly binds All things in the spell divine Of its own tranquillity— A spell serene, and yet intense, Potent, I know not how or why, To purge with fire each baser sense, And bid all coward cares within me die. III. Spirit of Light! deign thy dew-drinking steeds, Fresh from the lucid meadows of the dawn, To ravish me from these bounds? My soul recedes, Into the limitless ether far withdrawn, Where sanctuaried in light, Dim larks in rapturous flight Make vocal the sunbeams. I mount, I fly, I tremblingly aspire, On their immortal glee's wide-quivering streams, To the dread fount of life, love, liberty! Kindler of song! Lord of the new-born Day! Make me a wingèd lyre, And in wild music let thy masculine fire Leap from its chords, to swell the breasts of May With passion infinite; That with the bards of thine ethereal choir I may outpour my song of undismayed delight, Of unabashed desire! IV. O that my song were like a violin's voice, Soaring through life's tumultuous symphony With weird prophetic cry! That I might feel my music-shedding wings Rush in the rushing blasts of modulation, To thrill the world's despair with fierce vibration, And work tempestuous change in mortal things; That from the voiceless deep my venturous voice Might rend all hearts with dread Promethean cry, Bursting in its last agony The gates of hell with one strong word: ‘Rejoice!’ Then should life be new-shaped, like eddying sand In music's Orphean hand; New-born in Love's divinest chastities, That kindle and not freeze. V. O that my song were like a trumpet's tone, Uplifted stern in thunderous proclamation Of glory and scathing shame— A wind sublime of holiest exaltation In spirits pure, urging the heroic flame To burn into that all-transcendent zone Where crowned Ambition bleeds on Love's bright martyr-throne! Then should the founts of homely joy outleap From their lethargic sleep; In poise intense of passionate self-control Move the full-orbèd soul. VI. Alas! my song is all too weak a thing For flight so wild: my soul is as a sod Swept by a sky-fall'n lark's yet fluttering wing, Warmed by its beating breast—the pulseless clod Red with a martyr's passion! What were I To mount so high in grace, To bear the bliss of such redeeming agony? Here let me find my place— Where glad green buds flock out upon the boughs To pasture on the bounties of the morn, Where every turf draws strength from heaven's own face, And, joying to be born, Flowers gaze from the deep grass, lifting their brows To her mild eyes, with eyes that fear no scorn. VII. O virgin-cheeked and mother-hearted May, Madonna of the months! give me to know The tender founts that in thy bosom flow, The shy, sweet dreams thou dream'st as day by day Thy gleaming smiles so wistfully come and go, The sweet heart-shudderings veiled from vulgar guess In thy lyric loveliness. VIII. Thanks; for thy being into mine has past, I feel, and I expand in the glad feeling, Thy growthful impulse working through the vast Of tardy time; as through each sense come stealing Yearnings wild, conceptions dim, Bashful prophecies of June, Vernal voices which forehymn Some wondrous harvest's opulent boon. IX. Comfort ye, hearts that weep—be comforted! Have I not wept? Take courage, ye who toil In bitter fields! Have not I toiled, and shed From my enslavèd soul, wingless and numb, Red drops of anguish on the barren soil? But now my hour is come! I dare to raise the song, the song of joy— The song of boundless hope I dare to raise— Young martyr-thoughts on eager wings deploy Through visionary ages, as I gaze; Fire in their eyes, their faces onward bent, Pale to the lips as the white flowers they bear, Quickening the winds with light, they singing scare The dull and stagnant world from base content. No, no, they are not dead, The loves by which we live, The hopes for which we have bled, Oft faint, oft vanquishéd, The truths for which we toil, the light for which we strive! X. No, though the winter of the world's despair In tomblike night have shut us from the sun's All-fostering face, still in our branches runs The sap of lusty life; though sordid care Cling round our buds like frost, The blossom of delight lies nurturing there In its cradle tempest-tost. XI. O by our wants, and by our winged desires, And our hearts' quenchless fires, By our wild prayers, our tears outpoured like dew Upon the fields of life, and by those rare Impulses of deep joy, which quicken us through With Spring's divinest air; By each epic deed unsung, By the loves that find no tongue, By the faith that never dies, By its wrestlings, by its cries, By each meek sufferer's blood—the blood Of Earth's mysterious motherhood— We exorcise despair! XII. Still Love shall raise and comfort wan-faced Hope, And when Love bleeding lies, Hope shall read clear her cloudy horoscope With self-fulfilling prophecies. SONG. Hither, O love! Come hither On pinions of young delight, Ere the bloom of the morning wither, While the dew lies bright; The meadows their balm are breathing, Day bends o'er the limpid lake, All nature her beauties wreathing For thy sweet sake! O joy is the mate of morning, And love is the child of light, And youth is the time for scorning The bonds of night! Then come—while the world lies jaded, The elves of the woodland wake, And dawn keeps her fields unfaded For thy sweet sake! A SUMMER NIGHT. It is a night too silver-sweet for sleep, The stars shine softly bright, and delicate airs Play through my open window languidly, With summer perfume on their gentle wings, Robbed from deep-bosomed roses. Yonder streak Of paly gold marks where the sun went down In burning glory; and now the rising moon Half hides her blood-red orb behind those elms That whisper to each other. Silent it is, Most silent, save when from the meadow deep The corncrake calls her mate, or far away A watch-dog bays; so silent that you seem To hear the growth of all things, as the dew Sinks down refreshfully, and seem to feel The throb of Nature's pulses, and the wings Of Time stealthily waved with downy beat. The starlight silence draws me: I must roam— Past my still garden; past the pastures low Breathing of meadow-sweet; up this dim lane; Into the dewy woods, led by the light Of the new-risen moon. A sudden joy— A shudder of deep delight—thrills to my heart, To be alone, hid in the nightly haunt Of that fair Spirit whose permeant essence fills Each tiniest leaf with living beauty. Here, Where the wood-smells are sweetest, where the dew Lies pearliest on the balmy eglantine, And each clear drop a soul of fragrance takes From curvy trumpets of the woodbine trails Wreathing dark-glosséd hollies; where the flowers Of maiden-pure wild roses strew the grass With delicate petals—might one suddenly come On some quaint scene of elfin revelry. HERTHA. I was walking alone in the heathy uplands of Sweden, In a day of delight; when the radiant Spirit of Summer Wooed, in his passionate prime, the frank brave heart of the Norland To expand in his beams; when, palpitating in sunshine, Ravished of winter-woven robes, serene in her beauty, Proudly her limbs Titanic she bared, and bountiful bosom, And, new clothed in delight, abandoned herself to her lover. O, believe me, 'tis here alone in the cloudlands of Hertha, Here alone that the heart can be filled with the joy of their nuptial, When the young Summer first kisses the Earth. A jewelled Sultana, His voluptuous East would hold him captive for ever, Drugged with her spicy philtres; the bliss of meeting and parting, Love's sweet rhythmical ebb and flow, the romance of a passion Wholesome with rapture and rest—an ocean that knows not stagnation— These are the North's. All nature, rejoicing, blesses the bridal, When in the odour-breathing Norland, the Spirit of Summer Wafts from his breezy wings a dewy quintessence of sunshine, And descends in a shower of delight on highland and lowland; When the mountains grow green to their tops with juiciest herbage; And far up, with lows of content, to pasture are driven Cows, deep-uddered, and milk abounds, and in opulent dairies, Maids at the foaming churn try fortunes; when down to the valleys Comes, with his reindeer, the mild-eyed Finn, good-humouredly singing, Happy to water his herds in the reach of the glittering river; When the pine and the birch exhale their odours balsamic; When the raspberries breathe their dim delicious aroma, And, where they drink the sweets of the sun in the glades of the woodland, Strawberries ripen; when fiords, bights, bays—ay, the waves of the ocean Spawn with abundance of life. O there, in happiest season, There was I walking alone—when toward me, stepping like Hertha, Came a maiden fair, a blonde Scandinavian Maiden. Swiftly toward me she came, her well-shod feet and well-stockinged Planted clean on the turf, beneath her kirtle of home-spun, Beautiful, cowlike, august—the stern, sweet curves of her figure Clear a moment against the blue, as she crested a hillock— Beautiful, cowlike, august, an Isis bred in the Norland! Swiftly toward me she came, her full yet firm-moulded bosom Drinking great lungfuls of life, as she skirted the slope of the mountain, And her clear voice rang like a silver flute thro' the valley— Chanting some quaint old lyric—some grave significant folk-song, Born from a nation's heart, and breathing its passionate longings In the face of the firmament. Forests, rivers, and mountains; And the wave-washed fiords; and waterfalls thundering ever Through their foam-lighted glens; and pastures green of the upland— Had their part in that folk-song; the warrior-shout of the Sea-kings; And the low of cows, and the homely mirth of the farm-stead, Hailing the harvest home; life, death, and winter, and summer, Had their part in that folk-song. The frank brave heart of the Norland Breathed it out in the sun, as balm is breathed from the pinewood. It was exhaled, none made it, it never had a composer, He who chanted it first lived on and sang in her spirit. Nearer she drew, lithe-limbed, a living robust Caryatid, On her head a basket of dainties fresh from the dairy, Lapped in a fair white napkin, and poised with delicate balance Over her shoulders broad, which harmonised every motion As in a natural dance. O did she dream of her beauty? Her large grace? She felt it but ease, was but conscious of keeping Poised her butter and cheeses—her rhythmic muscles obeyed her With the gladness of tune—I read no toil in her features; And she knitted the while, scarce glancing down at her fingers; For her soul was a song, her motion a musical measure! Back on the wings of Time was I borne for ages and ages, Back on the wings of Time, to lands far distant, and saw the Tents of a wandering race, the tents of our Aryan fathers, Pitched in primæval pastures, their cattle lowing around them; And their kings were shepherds, and in their primitive language Milkmaid and princess were one. Here moved an Aryan Princess! Blue were her eyes, as the skies on a day of serenest weather, Or forget-me-nots, gage of unchangeable, innocent, troth-plight; Sweet was her face, with a grace the gift of the rain and the sunshine, And her cheeks glowed bright with blood of healthiest breeding. As she approached me the song on her lips died gently, not shyly, And she met my gaze unembarrassed, and greeted me kindly, Gave me a genial ‘Good morrow!’ then, pausing, spoke in her patois, In her grave pure voice, some further words, which, alas! were Lost on my ears. I could but smile; and answered in English: ‘Don't understand you, my girl.’ But in the depths of my bosom Those strange words were singing a ‘Welcome, welcome to Sweden!’ Cowlike I called her before, but how shall I picture the beauty Latent in that rich word—the exuberant feminine beauty, Seeming to gather in form supreme the teeming abundance Of the mother-force of the earth? O you comprehend me, You who have heard in the Alps the tinkling tune of the cowbells, You who have watched, some evening, a well-cared, thorough-bred heifer, Mountain-bred, mountain-miened, descending the paths of the mountain, Sure of foot as a Gemse—your heart has leapt to behold her Large beneficent grace, as she walked sedately and neatly At the head of the herd! But, let me ask, have you ever Spoken to such a cow in your own vernacular English? Well, I have; and I tell you that now as I spoke to the Maiden— I remember it well—that now, as I answered in English, Over her face there passed a wistful puzzled expression, Such as I then have observed in a cow's. 'Twas as though she were seeking Entrance to some far world, half seen in innermost vision— Strange, bewild'ring, remote from the placid fields of her spirit. But in a moment her eyes lit up with sunniest humour, (Never did cow's do that; and truly for use of her fingers Never was cow came near my blonde Scandinavian Maiden). How those eyes lit up as she smiled! ‘I see you're a stranger.’ So, I imagine, she said; then bade me farewell, and we parted; She on her way, I on mine. I gazed at the beautiful figure As it passed from my view. Then first I noted with rapture How her womanhood's strength burst forth in the glorious profusion Of her hair, thick wound in plaits—what a pad for a basket! Wonderful hair it was, like hemp for the galleys of Odin, Clean first-quality Norway hemp, with luminous surface, And the gleam of straw just playing over its masses. How it burst from those plaits, in its vital exuberant beauty, Burst from those careless plaits, and waved in wisps on her shoulders, Dancing warm on the wind! Alas! she was gone—and the sunshine Passed with her from the day. She went—I lost her for ever! Never again to behold her! O fool to yield her so tamely! Fool, to let her sink back in the ocean of vague apparition Where we float immersed, like lumps of jelly Medusan! Fool, when a glance, a touch, a word, a step might have won her! O to snatch her away, to possess her, to live in her beauty; To awake her soul; to thrust it forth, like an eaglet Fledged, from its narrow eyrie; to watch its pinions grow stronger, Breasting the storms of the world, with the wisdom of love to sustain them! O to fling my past to the winds for her, toil as a peasant, Feel my pulses bound with the stalwart life of the Norland; To grow sane in her love; to surrender myself to her keeping; To surround her with blessing; to make her the beautiful mother Of a beautiful race, in some far Scandinavian valley! O to—! ‘Well I declare, what stuff the man has been writing! (Only Mary and me—you needn't look so dumbfoundered.) This is some idle romance your foolish brain has been weaving— Why, you were never in Sweden: Now, were you ever in Sweden?’ ‘In the spirit, my child, I was just now, when you thrust your Dear inquisitive face between my eyes and the vision. There, O long, long ago, in pre-matrimonial ages— There I once saw Thekla, that blonde Scandinavian maiden, That divinest milk-maiden, before those tricks demimundane We were deploring last night, as she sang at the popular concert, Hid her goddess-ship's wholesome bloom in violet-powder. That was all.’ ‘Indeed! In Sweden? and never to tell one? Don't believe it a bit! But really I cannot have patience With the pitiful way you men get on about women. You're the ungratefullest things—you never will understand us, Never will be contented, however we strive to please you. Just when we've left our rustic ways, our homely vocations, Our domestic receipts, our plaisters, our wonderful cordials, All to please you, because—’ ‘We insist on having Corelli, Dished us in mangled morsels by fingers that better were sewing? Heaven forgive us our sins if we do!’ ‘'Ssh, don't be provoking! Poor dear Jane,—what a shame to speak like that of her music! No, you know very well our wise intellectual masters Could not put up with such drudges—poor soulless housekeeping creatures: Wanted ‘companions’ forsooth, had felt themselves ‘not comprehended’— O if you only knew, you stupid things, how we read you Through and through, like a book’— ‘Ay, skipping all but the fiction.’ ‘Nonsense! I say 'tis you men who wreck your lives upon fiction, And what fictions, the most of you! Ay, and even the best ones, How they blunder about, poor souls, with their precious ‘ideals.’ Thorns at last will bear grapes, they think, figs grow upon thistles, And extremes lie down, like the lion and lamb, in their Eden. We make both ends meet in a much more practical fashion. But what I say is that now, when we hens are, really and truly, Doing our painstaking best to make ourselves mates for you eagles, Fluttering after your Lordship's dreams no doubt at a distance, Off you fly in a pet, and sigh for some beautiful savage, Cowlike! with hair like hemp! and so forth—O when you get her, See that she washes her face and the rest of her wonderful person— Mary could tell you such things of the dirt of those horrible Germans! Well, we English at least are teaching the world two great lessons: How to make drinkable tea, and the use of good soap and cold water. There, I hear your ‘beautiful race’ upstairs in his cradle; Do put by those things, and go and get ready for dinner.’ THISTLEDOWN. Fly, my songs, on tenderest wing, Every blast your way shall speed; Of my heart each tiny thing Bears the sweet and bitter seed. Fly, till in some heart you light, Twine your roots with its warm clay, Pierce to death the brood of night, And bring to birth the flowers of day. SONG. The hare has his home on the hill, The lark his nest in the grass; But I lie lonely and chill, Mocked by the winds as they pass. Where, ah, where! Ah, where shall I find, shall I find my rest, Or hide my face from the eyes of Care? Where, but in thy dear breast! IN AUGUST. Summer declines and roses have grown rare, But cottage crofts are gay with hollyhocks; And in old garden-walks you breathe an air Fragrant of pinks and August-smelling stocks. The soul of the delicious mignonette Floats on the wind, and tempts the vagrant bees From the pale purple spikes of lavender; Waking a fond regret For dead July, whose children the sweet-peas Are sipped by butterflies with wings astir. Evenings are chill, though in the glowing noon Swelled peaches bask along a sunny wall, And mellowing apricots turn gold—too soon For him who loves not to be near the fall Of the yet deathless leaves. Pale jessamine Speaks, with her lucid stars, of shortening days To spreading fuchsias clad in crimson bells, Lurking beneath the twine Of odorous clematis, whose bowery maze Of gadding flowers the same sad story tells. Now from the sky fall sudden gleams of light Athwart the plain. Black poplars in the breeze Whiten—the willows flashing silvery white At every gust against dark rain-clouds: these Glooming beneath their crowns of massy snow, And soaring onward with the wind that rocks The sprouted elms, and shadowing as they pass Broad corn-fields ripening slow In upland farms, where still the uncarted cocks Stand brown amid the verdurous aftergrass. Now scream the curlews on the wild west coast, And sea-birds sport in the sunned ocean—blue As the intense of heaven. The crested host Of mighty billows endlessly pursue Each other in their glorious lion-play; Surging against the cliffs with thunderous roar, Till the black rocks seethe in thick-creaming foam, And bursts of rainbowed spray Fly o'er the craggy barriers far inshore, Drenching the thrift in its storm-buffeted home. Now is the season when soft melancholy Broods o'er the fields at solemn evenfall; The golden-clouded sunset dying slowly From the clear west, ere yet the starry pall Of night is silvered by the harvest moon: When the year's blood runs rich as luscious wine With honied ripeness: when the robin's song Fills the grey afternoon With warbled hope: and memories divine Crowd to the heart, of days forgotten long. IN A GONDOLA. [Suggested by Mendelssohn's Andante in G minor, Book I., Lied 6 of the ‘Lieder ohne Worte.’] I. In Venice! This night so delicious—its air Full of moonlight, and passionate snatches of song, And quick cries, and perfume of romances, which throng To my brain, as I steal down this marble sea-stair, And my gondola comes: And I hear the slow, rhythmical sweep of the oar Drawing near and more near—and the noise of the prow, And the sharp, sudden splash of her stoppage—and now I step in; we are off o'er the street's heaving floor, As my gondola glides— Away past these palaces silent and dark, Looming ghostly and grim o'er their bases, where clings Rank sea-weed which gleams, flecked with light, as it swings To the plash of the waves, where they reach the tide-mark On the porphyry blocks—with a song full of dole, A forlorn barcarole, As my gondola glides. II. And the wind seems to sigh through that lattice rust-gnawn, A low dirge for the past: the sweet past when it played In the pearl-braided hair of some beauty, who stayed But one shrinking half-minute—her mantle close-drawn O'er the swell of her bosom and cheeks passion-pale, Ere her lover came by, and they kissed. ‘They are clay, Those fire-hearted men with the regal pulse-play.’ ‘They are dust!’ sighs the wind with its whisper of wail; ‘Those women snow-fair, flower-sweet, passion-pale!’ And the waves make reply with their song full of dole, Their forlorn barcarole, As my gondola glides. III. Dust—those lovers! But love ever lives, ever new, Still the same: so we shoot into bustle and light, And lamps from the festal casinos stream bright On the ripples; and here's the Rialto in view; And black gondolas, spirit-like, cross or slide past, And the gondoliers cry to each other: a song Far away, from sweet voices in tune, dies along The waters moon-silvered. So on to the vast Shadowy span of an arch where the oar-echoes leap Through chill gloom from the marble; then moonlight once more, And laughter and strum of guitars from the shore, And sonorous bass-music of bells booming deep From St. Mark's. Still those waves with their song full of dole, Their forlorn barcarole, As my gondola glides. IV. Here the night is voluptuous with odorous sighs From verandahs o'erstarred with dim jessamine flowers, Their still scent deep-stirred by the tremulous showers Of a nightingale's notes as his song swells and dies— While my gondola glides. V. Dust—those lovers! who floated and dreamed long ago, Gazed, and languished, and loved, on these waters—where I Float and dream and gaze up in the still summer sky, Whence the great stars look down—as they did long ago: Where the moon seems to dream with my dreaming—disc-hid In a gossamer veil of white cirrus—then breaks The dream-spell with a pensive half-smile, as she wakes To new splendour. But lo! while I mused, we have slid From the open, the stir, down a lonely lane-way, Into hush and dark shadow! fresh smells of the sea Come cool from beyond; a faint lamp mistily Hints fair shafts and quaint arches, in crumbling decay; And the waves still break in with their song full of dole, Their forlorn barcarole, As my gondola glides. VI. Then the silent lagune stretched away through the night, And the stars, and the fairy-like city behind, Domes and spires rising spectral and dim: till the mind Becomes tranced in a vague, subtle maze of delight; And I float in a dream, lose the present—or seem To have lived it before. Then a sense of deep bliss, Just to breathe—to exist—in a night such as this; Just to feel what I feel, drowns all else. But the gleam Of the lights, as we turn to the city once more, And the music, and clangour of bells booming slow, And this consummate vision—St. Mark's! the star-glow For background—crowns all. Then I step out on shore. The Piazzetta! my life-dream accomplished at last, (As my gondola goes) I am here: here alone with the ghost of the past! But the waves still break in with their song full of dole, Their forlorn barcarole, As my gondola goes; And the pulse of the oar swept through silvery spray Dies away in the gloom, dies away, dies away— Dies away—dies away—! A FRUIT PIECE. I. I have seen the gifts that brown Vertumnus brought To coy Pomona, from the hot noontide Sheltering within her bower; when he sought With all his wealth to win her for his bride. The lusty god unawares came to her side, And laughing as half-drowsed his love he caught, Showered in her lap his pride Of fruitage ripe from orchard boughs down-raught. II. Upon his head he steadied a huge bowl, Forged out of gold by Vulcan, ivory-rimmed, Craftily carven with fantastic scroll Of legends olden and devices quaint, And sumptuously o'erbrimmed With its heapéd load—bees humming round it stole The hoarded sweets, and butterflies, half-faint For very bliss, fed, with their gorgeous wings Wide-waving to the sun with tremulous flutterings. III. Thence first he flung pink, delicate-fleshed strawberries; And store of cool-juiced cherries That freshen the parched lips of hot July; And currants red and white, Flashing in silvery light Like rubied carcanets in leafy canopy; With Ethiop mulberries of giant size, And musky amberous and red-blooded raspberries. IV. Then, as she smiled for wonder, he outpoured All fruitful Autumn's hoard: Lush golden apricots that, tasted, bring Memories of cowslipped Spring; Plump sun-split figs, shot with immingling shades— Olive and dusky violet, cloying-sweet; The burden of white-armed Sicilian maids In their brown baskets, where no siroc's heat Can blast the succulent strength of verdurous leaves, Five-cleft, and waving in the cool sea-wind With changing shadows flung on walls and eaves And bloomy, satin-skinned, And luscious-melting plums, purple and green, Bursting with ripeness, dropping at a touch From their age-wrinkled boughs—as they had been With their own treasures weighted overmuch. V. And still in her o'erflowing lap he poured All fruitful Autumn's hoard; Flushed nectarines, honey-hearted, morsels meet To recompense the earth-doomed Lord of song For lost Olympian banquets; and with these, Peaches he had watched, the sultry summer long, Bask on hot garden walls, whereto their trees Clung with their ripening load, sucking each sweet Of the boon soil; peaches, their downy cheeks Ablush with glowing crimson—luxuries Of fragrant richness, kept from prying beaks; Peaches with summer in their nectarous juice, And stored-up sunshine, and the soul of the rose In their ambrosial pulp! In heaps profuse He strewed anon the bower of her repose With royal bunches of fresh-blooméd grapes, Deep-purpled, luminous emerald, lustrous black, Tasting of vintage where warm southern capes Stretch with their vines to baked cliffs, hurling back In creaming foam the surge of opal seas— Full of old autumn's sunniest-hearted wine, His secret-hoarded, deep deliciousness. Lucid magnificent clusters huge as these Young Bacchus crushed with infant hands divine— Soft shapes of reddening vine-leaves, swayed by a breeze, Down-wavering on wide lips and fingers' stress. VI. And next he showed her, swelling in their pride, Great pine-apples, with leafy diadems Royally crowned, and clad in kingly mail Of scaléd bronze; smelling of forests wide Where magian cedars, from their opulent stems Exuding balmy gums, lend the soft gale Circean incense—borne for many a mile, To lure tossed sailors to some charméd isle. VII. Then rolled forth melons, green or ruddy-fleshed, Cool from sunned garden corners—every rind Split to display its dragon-toothéd seeds; With each well-flavoured kind Of fragrant apple, breezily rocked and riped, Beneath the guard of uncouth Termini, In orchards old amid the flowery meads. The earliest rime had touched maturingly The vintage of their hearts, and left them—striped Carnation-wise, red-cheeked, or shining yellow— Filled with fresh oxymel, frostily keen. Them followed odorous pears, sere-hued and mellow, Which seasoning hung, great-wombed, till they had seen August's last sultriness beloved by bees, Drinking the still delicious melancholy Of the declining year even to the lees; Till they might make sweet dreams not vanished wholly, Love-cherished sorrows, and long-lost delights, In seldom-opening cells of memory Dimly to live again. What next invites? Lo! clusters of brown filberts, snatched with glee By truant children in the squirrel's haunt, For their creamy kernels. On her lap fell last The fruit hell-tasted of Proserpina— Blood-stained pomegranates, plucked from boughs that flaunt Their scarlet flowers, though summer heats be past. This sumptuous vision on a day I saw. A SKETCH FROM NATURE. [Being a Painter's Jottings in Verse.] An Autumn day! Splendour of light and shade, Come the familiar landscape so to bless With visitings from the sky, that, glade by glade, The old grows new in its rich changefulness. How swell the breasts of those proud cumuli, Aglow with permeant light; no mass the same Even for an instant; each still hurried on By the fresh breeze, and rent—letting the sky Gleam through: domes—chasms—you know not how they came, And even while you are gazing they are gone. The sky!—the blue abyss of tremulous air, Alive with hues of subtlest palpitance, Through which you gaze for ever, yet can ne'er Fathom its azure, barred with many a lance Of delicate cirrus—child of upper heaven, Born out of mist, film-like, yet strangely still— High-poised above the passionate unrest Of the low-clouds that gather, and are driven, And ruined at the wind's capricious will— Vanishing into air, crest after crest. Magnificence of change! Upon the hill Cloud-shadows soft with fitful sungleams play, In tenderest sequence; while the fresh west wind thrills The frame with joy of health. Beneath its sway Yon field of ripening corn sways like a sea, Hissing. The grove sings in the breezy stress— Lithe beeches toss their boughs, and oak and elm Whiten at every gust, as gloriously They wave their deepened wealth of leafiness In the mid-distance, a wide-wooded realm. Now a cloud drives away, and warm and bright The sunshine smites this field. Yon cottages-eaves Are loud with swallows gathering for their flight, And now and then some restless spirit leaves The crowd, to skim once more the well-known plain; Far overhead are battling with the wind A pair of curlews—screaming as they pass; Around me insect-life goes on amain, Blithe grasshoppers with music of their kind Answer each other in the sunny grass. Magnificence of change! On such a day Existence is a passion: not the joy That fills the glad exuberance of May, But deeper, tempered with a calm alloy Of melancholy. When the ripening year Draws to its full fruition; when all hues Of earth are mellowest; when the changeful sky Is loveliest in its changes: yet we hear The winds begin their dirge for what we lose When Autumn's purple fruitage is gone by. IN SEPTEMBER. Where lurk the merry elves of the Autumn now, In this bright breezy month of equinox? Among tanned bracken on the mountain's brow? Or deep in the heather, tufted round white rocks On a wild moor, where heath-bells wither slow, Twined with late-blooming furze—a home of grouse? By river alders? Or on stubbly plains? Bound not their kingdom so: They follow Beauty's train, of all her house Gay pensioners, till not one leaf remains. The splendour of the year is not yet dead; After cold showers the sun shines hotly still, To dry the grass and kiss the trembling head Of each wind-shaken hairbell on the hill. The spirit has room to ramble far and wide Through all the breezy circles of the sky, To shoot on silvery beams from southern clouds Where sunlight loves to hide, Or brood upon the vale's blue mystery, Whence routed mists fly trooping, crowds on crowds. Heaven hath its symphonies! What tones combine To swell the cadenced chords of luminous grey That change upon the abysmal hyaline, Whose glimpses sweet throb to the azure play Of an ethereal melody, tender as eyes That shine through tears of unrequited love, Pure as the petals of forget-me-nots! Such unheard harmonies The deaf ears of Beethoven smote from above Through vision—filled with heaven his inky blots. As Ceres, when she sought her Proserpine, Slow moved, majestically sad—a wreath Of funeral flowers above those eyes divine— The widowed year draws ripely to its death. The moist air swoons in stilléd sultriness Between the gales; save when a boding sigh Shivers the crisp and many-hued tree-tops, Or the low wind's caress Wakes the sere whispers of fall'n leaves that lie, Breathing a dying odour through the copse. A few pale flowers of Summer linger late For languid butterflies, wind tost, that leave Their garden asters, tempted to their fate By the wild bees; stray blooms of woodbine grieve On their close-twisted stems in brambly dells— Haunt of the cottage-children's much delight On sunny afternoons; by hedge and stream Tremble the delicate bells Of bindweed, bride-like, with its wreath of white Moving things withering of new Springs to dream. Soon the last field is gleaned, safe harvested The tardiest-ripening grain, and all the dale Made glad with far-seen stacks; barn floors are spread With golden sheaves, sport of the clanging flail; In sunny orchards the mossed apple-trees Bend with their ruddy load, and wasp-gnawn pears Tumble at every gust; the berried lanes Blush with their bright increase; Brown acorns rustle down; and in their lairs Deft-handed squirrels hoard their daintiest gains. So the month wanes, till the new-risen moon Shines on chill torpor of white mist—stretched o'er Low-lying pastures, like a weird lagune In a dim land of ghosts; and evermore Through the sad wood the wind sighs wailfully, And great owls hoot from boughs left desolate, When first the morn finds skeleton-leaves made fair With frosted tracery; And then must all things frail yield to their fate— October strikes the chord of their despair! ROMAUNT OF THE MYRTLE. I. Never was song stranger than mine— All of a falcon that flew through the brine, All of a falcon that flew o'er the sea To the dim Islands of Twilight; where be Groves of pale myrtle—where wander and wait, Hovering and hoping, before heaven's gate, The ghosts of sad lovers! There wait and wander, frail meteors of fire, Spirits, death-snatched in their morn of desire, Their April of passion—when lips, at his kiss, Freeze, ere the heart be made perfect thro' bliss To pass the glad portals. There came the falcon that flew o'er the sea— To the wan white bosom of Eulalie. II. Never was song stranger than mine— All of a dove that flew back through the brine, All of a dove that flew back o'er the sea, With a pale myrtle-spray from the wan Eulalie, To Mainz in the Rhineland! In Mainz was high-feasting, and Berthold was there; And Frauenlob chanted the praise of the fair, And eyes grew more bright, cheeks more beauteous, and wine Foamed fresh to their lips, in great flagons ashine; And the king's heart was merry, the courtiers were clad In robes of rejoicing; but Berthold was sad For the loss of his falcon. To him came the dove that flew back o'er the sea, With that pale sweet token from Eulalie. III. Never was song sweeter than mine— All of this dove that flew back through the brine, To Berthold—mute-brooding, and wroth at their glee— With the flower of love-longing from wan Eulalie, Sweet, sweet with her sighing! Sweet with her sighing, and pale with her kiss— What glimpse of forgotten deep byeways of bliss Grew clear to his vision—what fragrance of dreams, What nightingale music by weird-flowing streams Made mystic each sense—what wild glamour bid start The passionate fountains long-failed in his heart, Till he fainted for yearning! And the king dropped his beaker, the minstrel let fall His ghittern—the music died harshly; and all Was tumult. Men rose, women shrieked, and 'twas said By knots of scared whisperers: ‘Berthold is dead! In Mainz in the Rhineland.’ But Berthold was speeding far, far o'er the sea, To the warm breast of his own Eulalie! CHORALE. Where shall Freedom's banner wave? Where shall be the glorious grave Of the world-redeeming brave? Not in fanes that once were holy, Cities proud, or hamlets lowly; Not in plots 'mid sheltering trees, Pleasant haunts of lovers' ease. But where lightnings flash and glare, Burning poison from the air; And the eagle laughs aloud In the glooming thunder-cloud; Where the free winds come and go, Where sweet waters rise and flow, On mountain-peaks where first the day Sets his feet that make no stay; There, clear-shining like a star, O'er the clouds beheld from far,— On her fortress, once the grave Of the world-redeeming brave, There shall Freedom's banner wave! ANASTASIS. How sweet the mother-touch of Nature's hand Comes cool upon the feverish brow of thought, When with dimm'd eyes and sluggard brain we stand, Athirst for some lost blessedness, unsought Long years—down-trodden in the onward rush That sunders us from our child-hearted selves; And with how glad amaze We lave grown limbs where deathless founts outgush In the fresh fields of youth, and genial elves Lull us with mellower music of old days! New heavens, new earth; yet with what quiet sense Of home long-lost; an afternoon, mayhap, We wander forth in sullen impotence, Dead, from dead labour—seeking but one scrap Of Beauty's bread of life—more sick for all The grimy squalor of suburban things; When from some lucid womb Of thronéd cloud that holds the heavens in thrall, Glorious o'er dusty trees, an angel springs, Strong-wing'd, to snatch us from the dismal tomb. And we arise new-born, as now I do, Crown'd with yon majesty of silver snows, Gathered and gleaming from the abyss of blue. The cloudland with its infinite repose Follows me moving, tempted on and on By rural glimpses—restful peeps—that yield Glad harvest for sage eye: Now 'tis a lane of hedgerow elms, anon Stray'd sheep at browse about a pleasant field, Or sun-smit poplars quivering in the sky. Subtly the changeful music of my mood Deepens to riper perfectness, and fills Earth and wide air with heaven. Lingering I brood By the shrunk river's bed. Each moment thrills With mystery of content, which gently blends All in one trance—burnt stubbles bare of sheaves— Clear shallows, with their cress And glancing minnows—osiered river-beds Shimmering in breeze and shine; even yellowing leaves, Low whisper with suggested happiness. Through all his ways boon Autumn seems to smile— O for the virgin lips of Perdita, To name the flowers that on this fairy isle Cluster and crowd! Here chaste Angelica Queens it, in leaves superb and tufted crown, O'er Michael's daises; and the rustling wind Stirs, like a rising thought, Pure bindweed bells tangled o'er brambles brown, With sad long-purples (by Ophelia twined) Mirror'd among the lush forget-me-not. Once more the supreme splendour of the year: I have invoked thee, Beauty, and my face Shines from thine orisons: no burdock drear Shall be my rosary in such holy place; But coral loading of the mountain ash; Or haws in bright profusion. Sauntering and slow I move with homeward feet, Glad with the village children as they splash The sand pools. Shall I find the evening-glow Warm on the starry jasmines of our street? THE WASTE OF NATURE. See Butler's Analogy. “A fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman!—The pity of it, Iago!—O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!” The wild wind dolefully Howls o'er the wintry plain, And shrieks o'er the desolate sea, Like a soul in pain. The old house shudders and groans, As the torrents of sleety rain Bluster and moan in the chimney And rattle the drenchéd pane. I sit by a dying fire, Watching the embers red; And the midnight is ghostly around me, And the house abed. And as gust after gust shrieks seaward, Far off on the waves to die, I seem to hear in the pauses drear, The time throb audibly by. Why dost thou ache, poor heart? Eyes, why will ye not close? Must these burning lids gape ever apart, Though I crave repose? I feel the wings of the ages Sweep over me in their course, And the wheels of the universe crush me With irresistible force. Is this Thy work, God of Mercy? Thy world a yawning abyss! Didst Thou make man in Thine image— Make woman—for this? That each should be bait for the other, As devils haul us ashore, Twice-tempted to double damnation? Or why did we learn this fiend-lore? O dreadful world, where one foolish fault— One paltry mistake— Will make such mischief as God Himself Can never unmake! Must a woman be lost forever Because she is blithe and fair? My curse upon love and beauty! My curse on the gifts that snare! What needs the curse? It has fallen— Naught else has power to damn To a deeper depth such a blasted Lost wretch as I am. Yes:—for this my thanks to the devil— One deeper plunge I can try: Tempt others down to perdition, And curse my Maker, and die. THE CHRIST-CHILD. The Christ-child came to my bed one night, He came in tempest and thunder; His presence woke me in sweet affright, I trembled for joy and wonder; He bore sedately his Christmas-tree, It shone like a silver willow, His grave child's eyes looked wistfully, As he laid a branch on my pillow. And when he had left me alone, alone, And all the house lay sleeping, I planted it in a nook of my own, And watered it with my weeping. And there it strikes its roots in the earth, And opens its leaves to heaven; And when its blossoms have happy birth I shall know my sins forgiven. ODE TO DYSPEPSIA. I. Accursed Hag! Hell-conceived, fury-born, Twin sister of the fiend Despair, avaunt! Hence with thy harpy talons, which have torn Too long my vitals! Down to thy damnéd haunt Of caverned horror and heart-eating woe! Leave me, and plunge below To that black pit, with all thy ghoulish crew Of loathsome-visaged shapes; Nightmares that come with pallid features blue To rack me with soul-shattering escapes From grisly phantoms. Vampires, flapping wings Obscene about my bed; Dread, formless, and abominable Things That rise from gory pools, till o'er my head The shuddering night is full of fiery eyes And threatening fingers pointing scorn! Ye dead, Haunt me not thus! Come not in fearful guise Gibbering from bloody shrouds, or, long-engraved. Rising to fear me with the abhorréd sight— What coffin-planks have saved From the worm's banquet. 'Twill not bear the light, That mass of swollen corruption—green decay Makes hideous every member! Get thee hence, Foul incubus! Take thy loathed weight away From off my breast! O sickening horror—! Whence Comes any help? I wake, and it is day! Thank heaven that night is done! But with the morn Come fiendish voices whispering suicide— Madness—damnation; with malignant scorn My anguish they deride. II. Joy, for my chains are breaking! Get thee gone, Fell sorceress! Hellward roll thy scorpion train, Too long its hateful coils have round me lain; But now thy reign is done. Day breaks in gladness, and night comes to steep Mine eyelids in her drowsiest honey-dew, And folded by the downy wings of sleep, Pillowed secure on her maternal breast, In happy dreams and healing slumber deep I sink to balmy rest. THE SEXTON'S DAUGHTER. O bitter, bitter was the blast, And bitter was the sky, And in the churchyard thick and fast The rain fell drearily. The rent clouds scudded by the moon And smothered up the stars; The bent gate creaked a dismal tune As the wind raved through the bars. The gravestones glimmered clammy and cold In the chill grass, row on row, And oozings cold sank through the mould, Till they froze the dead below. From the grey porch came half represt An infant's famished cry, Where a young mother, babe on breast, Had laid her down to die. There in the morning, stiff and cold, Clasping her child she lay. The sexton stumbled, I've been told, Upon his daughter's clay. HOW IT STRIKES THE CULTURE PHILOSOPHER. 'Tis written:—‘If thine eye offend, Pluck it out!’ Nay hold, my friend! Stop a moment—is it wise Recklessly to tear out our eyes, Lest they sometime may offend us? Looks the danger so tremendous, When we strive to walk by sight, That we should, trembling, quench our light And grope along, our path to find, Blind and leaders of the blind? Still his cry is:—‘Out, vile jelly!’ Men will go crawling on their belly, Eyeless,—doing ill what dogs do well, Finding their way by dint of smell! ‘This way our Master's footsteps went.’ What! do you never lose the scent? 'Tis so befouled, one might suppose The eyes should supplement the nose. And you cripples—halt and maimed! Do you never feel ashamed Of limping in such sorry plight? If a limb were lost in fight, Of the stump one might be proud; But to glory in avowed Self-mutilation, pardon me, Looks like downright insanity. Prepare to run the race of life, And use the amputating knife On your own limbs! Well, heaven preserve us! You christian stoics make one nervous. I can't maltreat my flesh and blood, As if 'twere only so much mud, I must strive onward all complete— Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and hands and feet. It seems to me I need them all; If for whole men your heaven's too small, I can't get in—I'm satisfied, Till it's enlarged, to—stand outside. (Strange, while I scarce can stir a peg They make such running on one leg!) III.—THE MYSTIC. ‘They are full of visions, dreams, revelations, trances, mountings, ecstasies. To hear them discourse is great wonder; for common things are to them mysteries. They will find whole macrocosms in the fall of a sparrow.’—History of the Mystics. A VISION OF DEATH. On the white margin of a dim sea-beach I stood. Behind me lay the mystery Of an invisible ocean, roll'd in clouds Upgather'd from its face in thunderous folds, Whose volum'd hugeness, in grim Titan throes, Contorted and convolv'd, yet seemed to hang. On the still'd air like a volcano's smoke; Majestical in ponderous self-restraint, For all their dreadful working. Black as death, Or the deep night of chaos, hung those clouds, Unpierceable by the sweet morning beams Of the new-risen sun, which scarce had power To silver them a little on the edge. But all along the fair line of the coast, Foam-crested billows, full of lusty life, Leap'd out beneath the columns of the cloud, And broke upon the shore; and caught the sun In the swift eddies of their gleeful surf: And dash'd the polish'd pebbles to and fro, With such a fresh and shingling noise, as made A gladness in my heart. Then, like a child In a new wonder-world, I stoop'd and por'd For hours on all the treasures of the beach— On rainbow'd bubbles, winking quaintly out, Left by the hissing spaces of the foam; On strange sea-creatures, corallines, and shells, And fragile weeds of hues the loveliest, All smelling of the sea; whose ancient breath Mov'd me to tears, and yearning, and deep love Of that mysterious ocean. And all the while The sound of its long thundering on the shore Boom'd in mine ears. And suddenly a thought, Delightful and yet dreadful, seiz'd on me With shuddering of rapt awe: ‘How came I hither? Across yon trackless ocean from what land? Or was I flung from out the ocean's breast Even as a weed?’ Whereat I stood and gaz'd Into the clouds; but answer to my thought Found nowhere none. Yet something in my heart Whisper'd me that not many hours ago I could have found an answer. Then those clouds Smiled like familiar faces. Hours ago? Hours—hours: Or was it years? And then I saw My shadow, like a luminous belt upon The blackness of the cloud. But now the sun Made pleasant all the air, and songs of birds From the unexplor'd recesses of the Isle, Came with sweet inland odours on the breeze, Luring me from the shore. Inward I mov'd By slopes of delicate grass, which gradually Broaden'd into a meadowy wilderness— A paradise of flowers, where still the dew Trembled in blissful tears upon the spray, Diamonded blade and bud, and hung with pearls The filméd gossamer. And everywhere Was snow'd from lavish fruit trees in full bloom A wealth of roseate petals,—blown about On sunniest knolls where splendid cowslips grew, And shadiest nooks belov'd of primroses;— Sent eddying into nests of violets; And shed beside soft crimson daisy-buds. There the sweet air was loud with utter joy Of birds, and bees, and grasshoppers that sang Shrilly as birds. The very flies humm'd loud Above the warmth of basking beds of thyme. The butterflies were giddy with delight And flutter'd up and down beneath the blue, In wavering glimpses of pale colour. All Was morning, and rathe Spring, and festal life! But I rush'd on half-blindly, like a child Drunk with the mere excitement of the Spring,— On through the verdurous freshness of a wood; Trampling the hyacinths with my careless feet, And the frail pasque-flower, ruthlessly, and scarce Pausing to pluck a stray forget-me-not From out a stream, before I left the wood, And mounted blindly up a steep of rocks, Clinging and clambering, till with wearied limbs, Bruis'd in the toil, I found myself at last Safe-landed on the summit. Pantingly I stood and gaz'd around. Before me lay A region sloping to a mountain-side, Like a rich valley lifted on the flank Of some majestic Alp—the soft green grass Undulant about the giant stems of oak, Walnut, and beech, and chesnut, emerald gleam'd Where the sun smote it. But beyond, the clouds Hung low upon the forest, and conceal'd The mountain from my view. A single peak Volcanic sprang to assert itself above, Cutting the blue with its pure crown of snow, And stood there still and stern. Out of the clouds Came ever and anon a sullen roll Of thunder, like the voice of the Beyond; And all around me I heard near and far A noise of rushing torrents. On the brink Of that sheer wall of rock so rashly scal'd, I lay to rest, couch'd upon springy heath, Among the myrtles that grew everywhere About the upjutting crags, mingling their flowers With rhododendrons and pale cistus blooms. And now that sole spray of forget-me-not, Flung from my careless hand upon the sod, Seem'd to look up with blue upbraiding eyes— Most homelike, sisterlike. I know not why It fill'd me with such passion of regret For all the Paradise left far behind, For evermore behind—and weigh'd upon me With fateful bodings of the drear To-come! Soon, as I lay, the fragrance rich and dim Breath'd from those myrtle's mystic chalices, Wherein the Angel of Delight had once Whisper'd the orient secret of the moon, With blissful spells and ancient wizardry Of love, was wafted o'er me, and combin'd Lullingly with the cool and silverous sound Of waters in mine ears. My soul was fill'd With a voluptuous splendour of romance And pomp of dreams chivalric, and my heart Throbb'd high, as in its golden prime of love, With secret and ineffable exstasy, Serene and sweet—until there came again The yearning of the sea. Swift to my feet I sprang, and earnestly gaz'd back. I saw Far off the mighty columns of the cloud Black as at first. But, all at once, behold! Even as I gaz'd, terrible brightness shone Through their abysses, blaz'd to heaven, and died In tenfold darkness—silent and sublime, As Autumn lightnings palpitant through all The spaces of the night. Again, again, And yet again, it leap'd against the sun And dimm'd it. Like the brandish'd sword of God It lighten'd through the abysses of the cloud— Apocalyptic splendour! Yet withal It was, methought, a pure and living light, That hurt not for its excellent brightness. Prone I flung myself when its last pulse had ceas'd, And hid my eyes and peer'd into the dark To see what I had seen. In second sight I read the hidden vision. I beheld The billows of the illimitable main— The mystery of their eternal change. And lo! a floating island mov'd upon them, Full of dim shapes; and creatures like to Gods Wander'd through lucid labyrinths in and out; And semblance of angelic multitudes Stream'd up and down amid the radiance Upstreaming from the isle. And where the light Fell on the waves I saw how all the sea Was full of life. But evermore the peak Of the volcano with its muffling clouds, Dwelt like a deepening shadow in mine eyes, And blurr'd the vision. But now the sun grew hot; And the low-lying mists were lifted from The shoulders of the mountain, where the pines Hung sombre like a garment. Only around The central peak clung a mysterious veil, Gathering and waning changefully in the wind, Impenetrable ever. Then my heart Was fill'd with irresistible desire And fiery impulse toward the frozen fields That slept in cloud. I hurried on my path Upward, still upward, through the pleasant slopes; Leaving the gracious chesnut shades—the oaks, Great-hearted in their strength—the walnut trees, Magnificent as oaks, which wav'd to me From their dusk leaves a perfume as I pass'd; Till, toiling up the heathy crags, I gain'd The skirts of the pine-forest. A cool of awe Fell on me as I enter'd, such as falls Upon one entering from the sunny street Some dim cathedral's vastness hush'd and still. The mountain rose between me and the sun, Impending o'er me its gigantic bulk, Dreadful as death; and all the twilight gloom Was full of strange forebodings. Fitfully There swept throughout the melancholy aisles A soughing wind that rose, and sighing died In solemn and sonorous cadences, Mysteriously. A ghost of forest balm Haunted the air, like incense shaken still Day after day from the obsequious hands Of mournful Dryads, in the sacred groves Of their forgotten Pan. And all around I saw the mighty stems of ancient pines Shot stern and straight into the sky. No note Of bird reliev'd the utter loneliness. Wearily I clamber'd on from tree to tree, From crag to crag, through the deep forest-dells Where all the ground was hoar with knee-deep moss— Wandering and lost, until there boom'd a sound Of waters in mine ears. I was athirst, And made toward its cool murmuring. Louder grew The deep and sullen roar, and louder still; And suddenly I came upon a gorge, Where pent between the bleak precipitous rocks, Below me far, I saw the torrent rush, Boiling and bellowing in the drear abyss, Its lurid surges raging into foam Around the tumbled boulders. And above Its highest cataract, where the gorge was cleft, Between the parted pines I mark'd the gleam Of a great glacier. Pushing boldly on, I found a path which wound along the marge Of the abyss, and lo! a crystal stream Well'd up beside it, gushing out beneath A giant rock, which sprang across the way Threateningly. There I drank, and felt new life In all my wearied limbs. Around the face Of that huge rock I crept half-trembling—slow— Clinging with feet and hands in dizzy fear. Then, climbing on and leaping chamois-like From block to block, and labouring upward still, At length I stood upon the glacier's brink And saw its frozen cataracts coil'd about The broad base of the peak, whose lonely snows Were lost in muffling cloud. I stood and view'd The silent surging of yon flood of ice, Which heav'd into ten thousand ridgy crests And pinnacles grotesque—phantasmal shapes, White formless forms, like Styx-bound multitudes Of ghosts, down-thronging, eager through despair, Rank after rank—the foremost urged along Inexorably by the resistless weight Of the still-crowding myriads. All between The lucid rifts gleam'd with ethereal hues Of purest azure. Silence awfully Possess'd the clarid spaces of the air Like a living spirit—unarous'd from sleep By the chill tinkling of the glacier-streams, Or crack of ice, or moan of avalanche. On the far shore an ancient lava-flood Came sternly down to where the keen bright waves Of the ice-river had cut their pauseless way Through it and over it; till both huge tides, Turning, flow'd down together to the vale, Ice over lava. The swart lava-flood Led up to the recesses of the peak, Like a broad causeway: and on either hand Was pour'd a loose shingle of stony waste— Pumice and scoriæ, pil'd in pyramids Against the bases of black barren cliff. There on the brink I stood, and shudder'd, faint, Dwarf'd into nothingness. I seem'd to look Into the eyes of death. Was it despair, Rapture of daring, madness, that prevail'd To urge me on? For almost ere I knew That will had grown to action, I was there, Upon the glacier, battling with the ice, Struggling from certain death to certain death, From ridge to ridge; crevass upon crevass, Yawning to gulf me, pass'd I knew not how, Until I paused high on the farther shore, Escap'd from all the the perils of the way. Then, mounting on the mighty lava-blocks, The first grim steps of that tremendous stair Which led I knew not whither, I stood still And turn'd to gaze. There lay the mountain side O'ergloom'd with pines; far off the verdurous glades And breadths of sloping woodland; further yet My wilderness of flowers; beyond, the clouds Still brooding o'er the ocean. And behold! The wide delight of mountain, glade, and plain Slept in the sunset. Sweeter than a dream, All rested silent in the sacred light! Then, as the sun slow sank into the sea, His golden face began to glow blood-red, And the low clouds flush'd luridly. The gloom Of gathering rain had roll'd upon the west From mountain glens far inland. Fold on fold Of sluggish nimbus sullenly seem'd to grow Great-womb'd with blood and pregnant with despair Like battle-smoke, lit by the flames of war By night upon a field of slaughter. Soon The conflagration paled as suddenly, And ashen hues of death dwelt in the cloud, And would not pass away. But through the rifts And at the ragged skirts of rain, I saw Glimpses of tenderest azure, vistas dim Of spiritual ether, and far away The spaces of the unstainéd hyaline. Sighing, I turn'd again. The lava-flood Grim in its terrible reality, Led up to the recesses of the mount, Like a portentous flight of giant stairs, Such as might give meet adit to the porch Of some hypæthral temple—rear'd by hands Of a Titanic race, ere wind of change Had breath'd on the Saturnian dynasty. Night fell; yet calm and passionless I stood, With freezing limbs; my numb and palsied soul Losing all certitude of self. I was not, Only the vision was. Unterrified, Listless of joy or grief, I stood. At last, Rousing myself, I cried aloud; and straight Scar'd at the human sound, over my head Seven ravens started from a scaur, and flew Screaming away. At that ill-boding scream The livid lightnings blaz'd from out the peak— Pale arrowy tongues of blue and sulphurous fire Hissing from rock to rock. And awfully The instantaneous thunder crash'd around, Stunning the gloom with spasm and quake of air At every detonation, and peal'd on Reverberant through the mountain—seven times Re-echoed and re-bellow'd—ere it died In solemn and sonorous cadences. And in the vivid-quivering flash, methought I read the hieroglyph of some strange tongue, Egyptian or Chaldee; and in the roll And metrical pause of the fierce thunder, heard The dreadful scansion of some mighty line Of unintelligible power. The veil Was rent before me, and on either hand, And overhead, the massive clouds were pil'd, Arching above the ascending lava-stair Wondrously. Then I saw no more the shape Of anything distinctly, nor could feel Motion of limb; nor know I if my soul Were parted from the body, and borne on Rushingly through the cloudy corridor. For even as in a dream we feel ourselves Wafted about in infinite ether, so Mov'd without motion I was wafted on, With a dim sense of mysteries seen and heard— Gleaming of phantom fires that glar'd at me With horrible features pale; and spectral limbs Red with great gouts of blood; and ghastly eyes; Voices, and shrieks, and thunderings of the mount. Methought one cried: ‘Beware the second death!’ And one: ‘The Anguish! Let him enter in! The kingdoms of the Anguish!’ And a third: ‘Igdrasil shall be blasted to the root! Woe to the nations! Woe!’ But suddenly all Was as a thing long past. I saw the moon Full in the sky, above the jagged rim Of circling cliffs that wall'd with adamant A vast and desolate crater, paven all With tumbled crags, high pil'd, or toss'd about, Like dismal billows on a frozen sea, Or strewn in waste confusion. Fire, and frost, And water, each had had its will of them. And in the unsunn'd crannies lay the snow Cold to the moon. Barren, and grim, and bleak, That desert lay, unblest by touch of life. Then, while my soul stood still, the central plain Was toward me shifted slow. A charnel steam Rose from the face of an unhallow'd mere, Whose restless waves boil'd up with horrible gurge And moan'd upon the shore. The stones around Were stained with gory scurf. Anon there loom'd Into my field of view the mighty mass Of a tremendous castle, bas'd upon The mere's marge. Nightmare-like it rose, and grew Huger in its inevitable approach; And as it came, damp horror worse than death Fell on me, powerless even to move or shriek. Slowly it drew nigh, and those abhorrèd doors Gap'd for me like damnation. Over me It swoop'd at last, extinguishing the stars; And I was ware how at the portal sat, Muffled in gloomy garments of the night, Abominable forms, unnamable In any mortal tongue. A sudden glare Blinded me, and a sudden hateful din Deafen'd my ears. The splendour of a dome Shone overhead an inner temple court, To whose vast brilliance and luxurious pomp Of dreams unclean, a hundred brazen doors Gave access. And a countless multitude Of peoples, kindreds, tongues, and languages, Throng'd in thereby unceasingly, and plung'd Into the maelstrom of a devilish dance, Surging around in ever-narrowing waves Of filthier frenzy. Rang'd about the walls The calm cold marble faces of the gods Look'd down in scorn. I saw Apollo stand, Beautiful as the dawn, instinct with light And majesty of quenchless power,—the wrath Of his victorious arrows yet unlaunch'd. I saw the august Divinities of Nile, Sphynx-like, from their eternal stillnesses Gaze far beyond the Paphian revelry, Away into the abysmal deeps of time, With awful, earnest eyes—silent. They seem'd To wait the apparition of some orb Of glory in the East. Beneath the dome, High in the midst, was rear'd an altar-throne Of burnish'd gold, whereto a marble stair, Seven-sided, easily led up. Thereon I saw One sitting, with a jewell'd crown And royal-seeming robe, dy'd as with blood Of slaughter'd thousands, stiff with woven gold, And all ablaze with gems: a monstrous form, Gigantic, bestial, bloated. From his face, Jaundic'd with sloth and coarse with cruelty, The stony eyes dull glar'd in idiot pride And deathful apathy of cold-blooded sin. And on his lap sat, circled round with one Luxurious arm, reclin'd against his breast, The likeness of a woman, meteor-ey'd, To blind with snakish fascination all Who breath'd her baleful influence,—lithe of limb And wanton as a tigress, and more fell. There nestled she against the monster's breast Her head thrown back, and all her lustrous hair Shower'd down upon his shoulder as she lay, Her splendid throat and bosom gleaming fair As poisonous Datura-flowers; one arm Flung round his neck, and one, uplifted high, Holding a rubied chalice, whence she pour'd Upon the surging circles of the crowd The blood of her accursed eucharist— Her wine of fornication. Such a weird And devilish beauty cloth'd her luridly, As tempted once the father of mankind In Lilith, and prevail'd, till his ill dreams Peopled the world with demons. But between Her Venus breasts, upon the flower-soft skin, I saw a thing: and at the abhorred sight My soul froze in despairful agony— The brand of the unutterable woe! The Anguish was reveal'd! About the throne Lay couch'd a hideous dragon, on whose crest, Horribly ridg'd, the Anguish based a foot For ease, as on a footstool. From the dome Incessant radiance stream'd, and I beheld How all the vault was ceil'd with living snakes Of gold, whose coils writhingly intertwin'd In convolutions intricate, shook fire From the attrition of their scales. Seven heads Darted about the centre hissingly, At venomous contention each with each— A rain of death swift-dropping from their fangs And vibrant tongues. The reckless multitude Still reel'd around in the infernal chain Of that unending can-can, to the sound Of a demoniac orchestra—the shrill Inciting scream of fifes libidinous, And languid rapture-sighs of sensual strings, And maddening clangour of blaspheming brass: While evermore the whirling feet beat time To the loud hell-drum and fierce clashing din Of Bacchanal cymbals,—faster and more fast As wax'd the rhythm more furious. Laughter dread, And sharp accursed cries, and maniac yells Burst forth appallingly—and songs obscene. The air was hot with shame—sick with the reek Of incense mingling with the sweats of hell. Then I beheld how each successive whorl Of frantic dancers, as they rag'd around, Nearing the centre spirally, was fill'd With keener cunning of impurity, And huger ingenuity of lust, And fiercer impetus of lecherous glee, And inspiration of lasciviousness, And epileptic fury, than the last. There I saw eyes of unalloy'd despair, And faces pale with anguish of desire, And panting bosoms and contorted limbs, And writhing arms—they whirl'd perpetually In undistinguishable surf upon The billowing vortex. And on all there fell, In horrible rain, great drops of poisonous blood, The baptism of the Anguish; and on all The fiery venom of the serpents fell. And where these fell the leprosy of lust Burst forth on scalp and limb; and bestial hearts Were given them, and great wisdom to work out Their own damnation. Ring by ring the leaven Of hell wrought in them more and more, and chang'd Their human frames to likeness of vile things More brutal than the brutes, self-gender'd still In hideous and unnatural mingling—down Through lower forms and lower modes of death, In retrograde progression. And at last, With cursing and hyena-laughter, all Were swallowed in the smoke of sacrifice That rose around the throne. Sickly I gaz'd In shuddering fascination, half-compell'd By some strong diabolic spell to plunge Into the outmost eddies, loathing much The felt tempation,—well-nigh swept away By the swift whirlwind of the motion. So I agoniz'd, resisting to the death; My will, at dreadful tension, almost drows'd By the persuasive atmosphere of sin. Then in my agony I strove to call On God, if haply God were not a name: But I was dumb. Yet on the moment came A feeble sound of voices in the air, Crying, as it seem'd: ‘How long, O Lord? How long? Wilt thou not come and save us? When will dawn The day of our deliverance?’ Then methought I could have wept for very sympathy. And lo! there fell from heaven a blessed cool Of silence on my soul. The hellish din Smote my ears faintly as from far away; As one caught up from out a city's midst A mile in air, might faintly hear the streets Roar with a tidal murmur, so I heard Sounding far off the surges of that crowd. And in me, or around—I know not where, I know not how—were born new sympathies Outreaching in blind ecstasy of life Toward some dim vast of Love. An inner sense Woke with strange revelations of a world New, yet familiar as a childhood's home Long raz'd from face of earth, but evermore Calm-standing in fresh fields of memory. Then through the walls of adamant I saw A dim gleaming of dawn. Silent it spread Through their dissolving bulk as through a cloud, Gradually, awfully, till all was lost In ether of auroral distances; And the hot snake-light sickened in the pure Of heaven. And holy breathings of the morn— Wafture of dewy woods, impulses deep From the rejoicing mountains, voices glad Of cataracts leaping in their strength, and sighs Of happy awaking from child-hearted flowers, Came to me. And the sun's disc shone reveal'd Over the misty meadows of the dawn, A visible Shéchinah:—above that crowd Which saw not how the Anguish pal'd for fear, Nor all the empyreal mystery of the East Far-flooded with the glory of the Lord. Then, while in tremulous hope I marvell'd much What this might harbinger, a burst of song Shook in an instant earth and kindled sky, And all the castle shudder'd, as the walls Of Jericho at the victorious trump, With its vibrating ecstasy. The bliss Of inmost harmony wide-echoing rang Through dumbest things, and made them orchestral. ‘Christ is arisen!’ I heard the antheming Of the bright company of the morning stars; I heard the voices of the Seraphim Go forth sublime to the utmost ends of heaven, Which seem'd to lighten music, and proclaim: ‘Christ is arisen!’ I heard the Cherubim Cry to each other, golden-voiced, proclaiming: ‘Christ is arisen! arisen!’ and veil'd my eyes In the stupendous hush of deepest awe That follow'd on that cry. I look'd, and lo! I saw One standing, like the Son of Man, Strong as the dreadful firmament, and pure As virginal crystal; and I saw his face Glorious with infinite brightness, as of fire Quickening the universe. Upon his head The crown of thorns was budded marvellously, For every thorn a flower of joy, snow-white, And vermeil-ting'd, and ey'd with burning gold— Sweeter than roses planted by still streams In the blest fields of Sharon, holier Than marriage lilies of St. Katharine: The fragrance of them fill'd the abhorréd place With sanctity. Snow-white his vesture shone; But on his kingly shoulders glow'd the robe Of supreme purple, and in his firm right-hand The sceptral reed was grown an Aaron's rod, And shepherded the nations. Out of him Came majesty and might, and love divine, And blessedness, and rest for evermore. And all the gods bow'd down and worshipp'd him. The sunshine of his terrible purity Shone on the infernal revel like a curse, And shrieks of fear and noise of cursing rose Against him from the multitude, and loud Their orchestra bray'd forth its blasphemies, Eager to drown the choiring of the stars; And all the brutish drove of human swine Rag'd in their maniac lusts before his face, Gnashing their teeth and crying: ‘Let us alone, Thou Christ! Torment us not; for what have we To do with thee? Pass by and vex us not!’ And clouds of smoke went up to cover them, With stench of incense. And I saw no more A human form; but a dread sea of death Engulf'd them, capable no more of will, Pleasure or pain: a frozen sea of ice Mingled with lava. Horror on me fell. ‘Is there no hope, O Lord!’ I cried; ‘no hope?’ And Christ look'd up to heaven with tearful eyes Of infinite tenderness; but stern his voice Rang like the judgment trumpet as he spake: ‘Who knows the mystery of iniquity? God is Love.’ Lo, I stood beside the Seine By night, and saw Parisian streets, ablaze With splendours of Imperial festival, And throng'd with moving thousands—eager all To sate their eyes on the spectacular pomp Of gorgeous lights, gay lanterns, wildering spires Of jetted flame, and lamps in labyrinths, Which everywhere among the spectral trees Glar'd on the heated gloom. Sheaf after sheaf The dazzling rockets rush'd against the sky, And shook their vivid jewels to the stars, And pal'd and fell. But far away the East Was fill'd with glory. Silently, awfully Titanic forms would half reveal themselves An instant—huge on thrones of luminous cloud, With Autumn lightnings palpitant through all The spaces of the night. The crest of fire That crown'd old Notre Dame wax'd pale thereat, And the bright Pandemonian pomp of gas Tawdry and sick in its intensity. And my whole heart exulted. I beheld How at his times God lets us gaze through Hell Into the deeps of Heaven that lie beyond. A SONG OF EXPERIENCE. I.—VITA NUOVA. All a dismal winter's day I wandered in a forest grey, Whose branches made a sullen sound; Where, weeping as I went, I found A lily-bud divinely fair Shivering in the frosted air. I blessed and kissed the virgin bud, And with three drops of my heart's blood, I warmed her heart and made her mine: And an awful joy did shine Through the woodland mazes frore; And where the scoffing wind before Blasphemed among the naked boughs, A gentle air flattered my brows With whispers of some wondrous thing. And suddenly meseemed that spring, With her host of glad green leaves, And fragrance dim of clustering threaves Of flowers among the pleasant grass, Was come. And shadowy wings would pass Of clouds over the tree-tops, stirr'd With the voice of every bird That makes the vernal branches loud. I saw them in a gleeful crowd, Mad with the rapture of the spring, I heard the incessant jargoning Forth-pour'd from each love-throbbing throat, I felt the bliss of every note Half-strangled of its amorous glee; I felt the boundless ecstasy Of every warm, fast-fluttering wing.— God knows I blest each tender thing, Blest them with tears from my full heart, Where I was kneeling all apart Beside my marvellous lily-bud, Bought with three drops of my heart's blood; Divinely sweet, divinely fair, Sanctifying all the air With her pureness and her love. Did I not bless thee, God above, Deep-nested in that blissful place? Did I not thank thee for thy grace, That thou hadst given me then to know Such recompense of passed woe? II.—DEATH IN LIFE. A long delightful summer's day Amid deep forest-dells I lay, Lulled with a far-off sound of flies; The luminous haze of summer skies Gleamed grey and sultry overhead, Tall pines nodded and whispered Still secrets in a gentle air. Lazily from my pleasant lair I marked their shadowy tops ashine Sway through the dreamy azuline— Lazily in my pleasant lair I hugged my heart, forgetting care. Whose was the fault? How entered in The dream of sloth—the sleep of sin— The lethargy of self? O Christ! Could no mere anguish have sufficed? No less tremendous doom than this Death of the heart to pain or bliss? What curse fell on me as I woke When the accusing thunder broke, With scourge of lightning and of hail Making the shattered woods to quail? What curse more than the curse of Cain, When I found my lily slain— Withered and blasted on her stem, Her angel-tended diadem Pashed by the dint of pitiless hail? O God, that then my heart should fail! That I should rend my breast in vain! That no sweet blood-drop should remain— No wholesome drop in all my heart That was not frozen! Where's the art That my blood can uncongeal? Where is the pain can make me feel? My tears are frozen at their source, No drop of life renewed can course Through all my numb and pulseless limbs; The dull cloud of my breathing dims The cruel firmament of ice Moving between me and the skies, Wherein my white reflected face Scowls me from love, shuts me from grace, From which my prayers rebound like hail; Where'er I gaze nature turns pale, Where'er I move there falls a blight Of frost on all things. Day and night My melancholy footsteps sound— They clank upon the frozen ground; They echo through the dismal glades, Where, as I move, the charm invades; They ice with horror every tree, The stark leaves tinkle shudderingly; They freeze the joy in every throat, They curdle every gleeful note; Into the stiff and quaking grass Down drop the birds—slain, as I pass, Pacing this desolate wood. How long, O Lord! how long must I endure This my sole hell? Is there no cure? No keen Promethean flame of pain That can make me live again? Sometimes a blessed pang will start Suddenly out from my heart, Sometimes the firmament of ice Between me and the sunny skies, Leaving its horrible repose, Will heave and stir with wondrous throes, Wherein my figure seems to shine Transfigured in a light divine Of spiritual sunshine. O then, Methinks I almost feel again The pulse of Spring! I am not mad— I ask no longer to be glad; I crave to feel but human woe Setting my blood and tears aflow,— But blessed anguish of remorse, That I may be no more a corse Walking the world. Grant Lord but this! Let memories of lapséd bliss With quickening sorrow thrill me through, With flame of pain my soul endue As with a garment; fuse my frost With tingling shame for senses lost, That stings like purgatorial fire: This is the end of my desire. Pass on your way, ye living men! I wait some dawn of change. Till then Pity me in your silent thought, But with your comfort vex me not. LOST. I wandered from my mother's side In the fragrant paths of morn; Naked, weary, and forlorn, I fainted in the hot noon-tide. For I had met a maiden wild, Singing of love and love's delight; And with her song she me beguiled, And her soft arms and bosom white. I followed fast, I followed far, And ever her song flowed blithe and free; ‘Where Love's own flowery meadows are, There shall our golden dwelling be!’ I followed far, I followed fast, And oft she paused, and cried, ‘O here!’ But where I came no flower would last, And Joy lay cold upon his bier. I wandered on, I wandered wide, Alas! she fleeted with the morn; Weary, weeping, and forlorn, She left me in the fierce noontide. FOUND. Naked, bleeding, and forlorn, I wandered on the mountain side; To hide my wounds from shame and scorn, I made a garment of my pride. Till there came a tyrant grey, He stript and chained me with disgrace, He led me by the public way, And sold me in the market-place. To many masters was I bound, And many a grievous load I bore; But in the toil my flesh grew sound, And from my limbs the chains I tore. I ran to seek my mother's cot, And I found Love singing there, And round it many a pleasant plot, And shadowy streams and gardens fair. Like virgin gold the thatch I see, Like virgin gold the doorway sweet; And in the blissful noon each tree A ladder for the angel's feet. A SONG OF REMORSE. I had a friend of my own, The truest that e'er was known; But the spiders of secrecy With jealousy wove the sky, And poisoned the wings of trust With a bloodless thrust. The freezing of love untold Made love in our bosoms cold, And the cuckoo-wings of pride Pushed its bashful brood aside. The angels of pain and care Made in his heart their lair, And the demon of despair Was my comrade everywhere. Now the angels of remorse Whip me away from his corse, And one kiss I dare not crave From the jealous grave. THE BOTTOMLESS PIT. I floundered in a pit of sin, Full of weakness, full of care, And on the brink one sang, to win My footsteps to his heavenly air. I turned in wrath against his song, And made a tempest of my rage, And blew tempestuous notes along The echoing iron of my cage. He bade me find a golden door, Opened by a golden key: Iron roof, and walls, and floor, Were all that ever I could see. I turned in wrath against his song, And made a tempest of my rage, And rushed in burning zeal along To the black bottom of my cage. But bottomless it was, in sooth, And through the world it did extend; Folded in my wings of truth, I crept out at the further end. And there again the sun I found, And there I found a garden bright; And while he deems me blindly bound I weave the flowers of his delight. A SONG OF SUSTAINMENT. I. When the riddle of thy life darkest seems; When no beams Pierce thy soul, of heavenly light, And thou dreamest in the night Evil dreams: Truly love the True, and truth shalt thou find; Thy vext mind Shall attain a golden shore Which thou sawest not before, Being blind. II. When the darkness as of Egypt round thee clings; When the wings Of vampyres foul flap near, And fiend-voices in thine ear Whisper things Obscene and horror-fraught, to drag thee down; When God's frown Seems in anger o'er thee bent, Heaven shut, and Christ content Thou shouldst drown: Doubt all else, if in thine anguish doubt thou must, Only trust That, though thou be tempest-tost, Rudder gone and compass lost, God is just. III. Faint and weary, wait on God patiently: It may be He would have thee stand and wait, Till He ope for thee a gate Meet for thee. Being strong, strive ever upward like a fire; Still aspire Toward the Perfect and the Pure— God appoints thy life, be sure, Never tire. Trust that all things well-ordered from above Rightly move. God is just—hold fast that creed, It will serve thee in thy need, Till thou come to know indeed God is love. THERE SHALL COME FALSE CHRISTS. I dreamed of a phantom Christ That fleeted athwart the sky, Fleeted and flicker'd across, and enticed After it, smiling, a smiling throng, Whose hymns were loud as they hurried along, Crowned with flowers and proudly elate, Jauntily blowing the trump of fate In the ears of the sorrow-stricken, Leaving the fainting world to sicken In the smoke of hell, and to die. I dreamed of a spectre Christ That wandered o'er all the earth; On its altars were sacrificed Sacred pledges and solemn vows; Sin built temples, with shameless brows, Virtue-whitewashed renewed her youth, Lying her lies in the cause of truth, Handing tracts to the sinners around— All that grace might the more abound. She had experienced a true new-birth. I dreamed of a demon Christ That glared upon land and sea, Throned like Juggernaut, coldly iced In the frozen armour of creed; Nerves must quiver and hearts must bleed For its worship where'er it came,— Fair limbs writhe in the scorching flame, Torments, famine, and plague, and wars, Made men made under sun and stars, To prove its dreadful divinity. I dreamed of a suffering Christ, A sorrowful Son of Man, Clad like a beggar—a stone sufficed For his pillow, his home the street, Rest was none for his lonely feet, Faint he was, and none brought him wine: But who gazed in those eyes divine Straight grew wise in life-mysteries, Wise in all human sympathies, Read in the world its inner plan. I dreamed of an awful Christ, The terrible Son of God: Him, the blood of whose eucharist Works, like leaven, in wine and bread, Life in the living, death in the dead. Where the gleam of his sun-crown fell, Earth, self-judged, became heaven or hell; Plunged in God, like a lake of fire, Each drank deep of his heart's desire, Love or hate—waxed or waned in God. When things that be are as things that seem, Then all the world will have dreamed this dream. PARADISE LOST. In the woodlands wild I was once a child, Singing, free from care, Wandering everywhere. Angels went and came, Like spires of blissful flame; All among the flowers, Fed with virgin showers, Angels went and came, Called me by my name. But a serpent crept On me as I slept, Stung me on the eyes; Woke with sick surprise. And a demon came With a face of shame, Spoke my sudden doom, Naked in the gloom. Then a dreadful sound Pealed through heaven's profound; All my lonesome places Were filled with dreadful faces Everywhere a face Full of my disgrace. PARADISE FOUND. Naked, in despair, Ashes on my hair, Menace everywhere, I fled from pallid Care. Weak as lamb new-yean'd, Followed by the fiend, With his whip of wires Red with my desires. Soon a sage drew near, Clad my stripes in fear, Bade me weep and wait, At a temple gate. But a maiden came With tender hands of flame, And by secret ways She led me many days. In the woodlands wild, Now no more a child, Among seraphs bright I clothe my limbs in light. Where the children sleep, Like a snake I creep; Kiss them on the face For their greater grace. A SONG OF SECRETS. ‘Who doth ambition shun, And loves to lie i' the sun, Come hither, come hither, come hither!’ I. There is a land of woods and streams I know alway in my dreams, Full of sunshine and sweet air, And wafted fragrance everywhere— A land of birds, a land of bees, A land of oaks and almond-trees, Where nibbling lambs and children stray All the livelong summer's day Through flowery meadows of delight. A land far seen in coolest light, With its slumbrous woods and streams Widening round the Mere of Dreams; Of deep rest and happy shades, Daisied lawns and solemn glades, And twilight haunts for lovers' meet, Where the mystic meadow-sweet, While Hesper cold sheds influence holy, Breathes luxurious melancholy. A land of infinite repose, Girdled about with wizard snows And fastnesses of ancient ice, Where the enchanted mountains rise, And far, sunlit glaciers shine Through visionary glooms of pine. There spirits of thunder make their home, And cloud-wraiths brooding go and come, And blithe winds renew their wings To bring health to all fair things— And mighty voices oft are heard Uttering some mysterious word Of potent tempting. Then, too fond! Passion of the land beyond With strange awe confounds my wits, Shaking my soul with ague-fits— Agonies—energies divine, That chill like ice and warm like wine. All the gladness of that land Such wild spell cannot withstand; I must leave its lawns behind To wrestle with the eager wind, Grip the rocks in stern embrace, And meet the lightning face to face. O bitter doom! O trance of pain! My gentle love, wandering in vain, Forsaken, by the Mere of Dreams, Through the land of woods and streams Seeks me with solitary feet. Then no more we twain may meet In angel-guarded solitudes Where no thing accurst intrudes, But the seraphim aspire Bearing their censers of sweet fire, And the seraphim descend In showers of blessing—each a friend, Closer and secreter to keep Holiest secrets than the deep Nuptial darkness of the night That hid her love from Psyche's sight. O bitter doom! O trance of pain! O love of lovers, loved in vain! Beneath a blissful almond tree My sad love sits and wails for me. II. Under the pleasant fields of sleep There deepens down a sunless deep, Under the placid Mere of Dreams, Which floats with all its woods and streams Above the abysses, where I know Every cavern of deep woe, Each unfathomed pit of fear That those dismal bounds insphere. Many and many a time my soul Has felt the clutch of him who stole Sad Demeter's Zeus-born child, Ravished to hell even while she smiled Girlishly among her flowers; Many a time his hideous powers On a sudden have made quake The glad waters of that lake— Slain my birds and slain my bees, Blasted my tender almond-trees In youngest blooming, and low-laid My oak's centuries of shade. Many and many a time have I— When my heart beat tranquilly, In some green secluded dell With my sweet love nested well; Or leapt in a more lone delight, Straining up some Alpine height— Heard those demon steeds, hell-black, Ramp up, snorting, at my back, Felt the unhallowed might of Dis Ravish me at a touch from bliss, As darkness gulft me! What strange doom Waits me in that fiery gloom? How may I reveal the terror Of the cavern's mazy error Where I sink with gloomy Dis? In my ears I hear the hiss Of the snake-fiends, as they fold My heart in Gorgon coilings cold. Shudderingly I name each name, Known too well: Despair and Shame, Whispering madness at each ear, Horror, and Jealousy, and Fear, Remorse, and Envy, and Desire, With clammy eyes of chilling fire, Of the hell-brood nine there be, And the last is Apathy. Oft when in their ghastly chain, Tired with struggling, I have lain, Long-captive in the tangling toils, Wound about with loathsome coils, A dread voice, of melody Keen as pain, hath cried to me: ‘Look on me, thou son of man!’ And lo! through the twilight wan Of drear hell, mine eyes have seen The still face of hell's pale Queen: She, even she—Persephone— With her glance hath set me free! Tremblingly before her throne I have stood, and I have known All the sadness of those eyes, Sad with love's last mysteries. In her caverns of deep woe Where no tears of passion flow, I have seen the germs of things, Bathed me in the secret springs That feed the tranquil Mere of Dreams; I have watched the mystic streams Of motherhood, like blood that run, Warm with kisses of the sun. All my oaks and almond-trees Bathe their hidden roots in these; Through every tender blade of grass And every tiniest flow'ret pass Their influent drops, like wine of blood, Moulding featly every bud And every leaf on every tree; The fairy dews, refreshfully Shed by night on every lawn, From their cisterns deep are drawn. This, the cavern of despair, The dark grave of all things fair, Joy's decay and beauty's tomb, Is but Nature's teeming womb, Where she fashions new things fair In their season meet; for there The wind of change blows without end, Into the abyss the hours descend— Virgin shadows, casting down Every one her fragrant crown: The wind of change blows without end, Out of the abyss the hours ascend, Each one freighted matronly With fruitage—to the minstrelsy Of planetary spirits of love In the crystal heaven above. Lo! the secrets of my dream Of that land of vale and stream, And of that unfathomed den, Dreadful to the sons of men. How many happy days and nights I dwell among those dear delights, Ten times as many must I dwell With pale Persephone in hell, While beneath her almond-tree My sad love sits and wails for me, Sick, till Orpheus-like I bring From the under world the Spring. IV.—SONNETS. TO MENDELSSOHN. [On hearing one of his Concertos.] O for a spell-built palace, by the craft Of Afreets reared, with sumptuous chambers high, Upheld on many a quaintly-carven shaft, And arabesqued with cunningest tracery; Where tempered sunshine should fall dreamily, Charming a crystal fountain to repose, And the celestial fragrance of the rose Should wafted come from shadowy courts hard by. There let thy music wake with fervid flow Of rhythmic undulations—like the sweep Of wind through midnight tree-tops,—murmuring low, In tenderest melancholy, or trances deep Of utterless joy; sweet songs of long ago, Sealing the eyes in happy-visioned sleep. THE FIRST SPRING DAY. But one short week ago the trees were bare, And winds were keen, and violets pinched with frost; Winter was with us; but the larches tost Lightly their crimson buds, and here and there Rooks cawed. To-day the Spring is in the air And in the blood: sweet sun-gleams come and go Upon the hills, in lanes the wild-flowers blow, And tender leaves are bursting everywhere. About the hedge the small birds peer and dart, Each bush is full of amorous flutterings And little rapturous cries. The thrush apart Sits throned, and loud his ripe contralto rings. Music is on the wind, and in my heart Infinite love for all created things. BEETHOVEN. Music as of the winds when they awake, Wailing, in the mid forest; music that raves Like moonless tides about forlorn sea-caves On desolate shores, where swell weird songs, and break In peals of demon laughter; chords athirst With restless anguish of divine desires— The voice of a vexed soul ere it aspires With a great cry for light; anon a burst Of passionate joy—fierce joy of conscious might, Down-sinking in voluptuous luxury; Rich harmonies full-pulsed with deep delight, And melodies dying deliciously As odorous sighs breathed through the quiet night By violets. Thus Beethoven speaks for me. ROSAMUND'S BOWER. Deep in my soul there is a region sweet, Untraversed of life's dusty carriage-wheels, Wherein my heart hath her divinest seat In trancéd quiet. There Time's shadow steals No sunshine from the summer; but great trees Bask in fair lawns and brood o'er haunted streams With restful shade, and music of happy dreams Is blown about the fragrant pleasaunces Where all pure thoughts find pasture. Never blight Falls from the azure heaven, whose dewy spell Keeps fresh the meadow-glades. There among flowers, Safe-nested in my inmost of delight, Hid from the world, as queen my Love doth dwell, Tended by blissful hands of virgin hours. A JUNE DAY. The very spirit of summer breathes to-day, Here where I sun me in a dreamy mood, And laps the sultry leas, and seems to brood Tenderly o'er those hazed hills far away. The murmurous air, fragrant of new-mown hay, Drowses; save when martins at gleeful feud, Gleam past in undulant flight. Yon hillside wood Is drowned in sunshine, till its green looks grey. No scrap of cloud is in the still blue sky, Vaporous with heat, from which the fore-ground trees Stand out, each leaf cut sharp. A whetted scythe Makes rustic music for me as I lie, Glad in the mirth of distant children blithe, Drinking the season's sweetness to the lees. AT LLANBERIS. Sunshine and mist strive for the mastery In yon wild gorge, this fresh delicious morn: Bright gleams, that die as fast as they are born, Light up the scarred grey crags, bare of a tree; Then mists roll down, pile themselves sullenly, Melt into air,—and all at once there breaks Out of the gloom a vision of sunlit peaks And mountain-glimpses wonderful to see. Change after change! till swoop the clouds upon This legendary tower, and quick drops warn To shelter from the beauty-blotting rain. Anon 'tis past: the crags shine out each one, Sunshine, and driving mist, and mountain-chain, Harmonized by the black sleep of the tarn. IN THE LOUVRE. A dingy picture: others passed it by Without a second glance. To me it seemed Mine somehow, yet I knew not how, nor why: It hid some mystic thing I once had dreamed, As I suppose. A palace-porch there stood, With massy pillars and long front, where gleamed Most precious sculptures; but all scarred and seamed By ruining Time. There, in a sullen mood, A man was pacing o'er the desolate floor Of weedy marble; and the bitter waves Of the encroaching sea crawled to his feet, Gushing round tumbled blocks. I conned it o'er. ‘Age-mouldering creeds!’ said I. ‘A dread sea raves To whelm the temples of our fond conceit.’ IN THE HASLI-THAL. Wearied in spirit, jaded and opprest With splendour of too huge sublimity, By a clear streamlet I was fain to lie, Under the shadowy spruces; lulled to rest By the leaves' murmurous melodies, and possest With still, reflected glimpses of grey sky. Upon my soul there fell refreshfully A dew of the woods, till, with a childish zest, I filled my hands with loveliest Alpine flowers, And flung them to the stream. Then forth I went, And met the crownéd mountains face to face— Strong to aspire with their exultant powers, Able to worship in that holy place In rapture of an infinite content. PSYCHE PAIDOTROPHE. The poet's soul is as a maid that pines For a long dreamed-of God; till on a day His kiss thrills all her frame, and she resigns Her ravished self, meek in love's tenderest May; And keeps her blissful secret afterward— Knows her old life but death—panting for wings To flee the sick jarring of untuned strings In her lorn lute, as aye with restful sward Some visioned Delos mocks her. Sweet to feel The life divine astir, to feed her blood With health, to muse upon her motherhood, And walk in trembling, till the Gods reveal Her bower of refuge. Then lone throes of birth, And a new Python-slayer breathes on earth. A DAIGNTIE-CONSEATED SONNET. [To his Friend, Master E. D., upon occasion of his enriching him with some honey'd posies of his most sweetlie-flow'ring Phansie, sendeth his lovg. Friend and indebted Servt.] Like as an oyster, when some secret wound, Smarting, his tender jellies doth amate, All pretiousnesse, the close-shut grief around, From forth the wealthful ooze will segregate: So thou, fair casket of concealéd grace, Strivest thy pearls, like blusht-for tears, to hide, And dark-engulft from bright Apollo's face Dost in thy shell too proudlie close abide. But I, a diver in the unruffled deep, Where thy shut shell doth covetise invite, Ponder what glorious harvest I shall reap, Bringing thy hidden threasures to the light. Dost fear my hands' rude grasp, sweet oister? Well, Give me thy pearls, Ile let thee keep thy shell. NESSUN MAGGIOR' DOLORE! No greater grief! Is it then always grief Remembering happier times in times of sorrow? Does one day of delight ne'er bring relief To the sick soul on a despairful morrow? Past joys are a possession. Oft we borrow Strength for our present pain from out the brief Bright moments garnered long in memory's sheaf— August's rich grains make glad December's furrow. Have once mine eyes beheld in vision blest Beauty's dread form, or Love's death-conquering face, My heart leaped up transfigured, as she sung, Who raised to life my life, whose gentle breast From the world's rush was my one resting-place,— Blind, deaf, and old—I see, hear, still am young. LOVE'S FLIGHT. Not doves but eagles be our birds of love! Shall we not, dearest, bid the world good-night, And soar to meet the sunrise where no dove E'er ventured pinion? In our perilous flight The austere winds shall welcome us; the bright Lightnings of dawn weave guardian tents above Our nuptial solitude; and round us move Auroral clouds, glad heralds of the light. Then, when earth fades, and all its foolish noise Ceases from our forgotten way, perchance Our wings shall fold in rapturous descent At Love's clear call. O then, to homely joys, Stooping our sunbathed plumes, down we shall glance, Perch in his lowliest vale, and be content! LOVE'S LITURGY. The little tender rites that lovers use, Daily to calendar their love confest, Are Love's own liturgy, which he endues With grace to compass his eternal rest. This rose, she gave me once, warm from her breast, Kissing in smiling pity the sweet bruise Of our close first embrace, with its dim hues, Bids tender thoughts leap singing from their nest. A touch can troth-plight for eternity; A kiss build there a home; in pure delight God spreads the sacramental bread and wine, Wherein Love grows incarnate. Curst is he Whose swinish thoughts, breeding pollution's blight, Trample to filth those elements divine. MERLIN IN THE TOILS. The silver-sounding trumpets of my heart Made glad acclaim when thou didst enter there, Like an expected Queen. No holiest part Of my most hidden life, but thou didst share— Nay, it was twice thine own. Thou, as the air Unto my blood, wast vital to my art; Till, traitress, thou didst trade in Folly's mart To sell me for a gaud, clipping the hair Of my ambition's might! Thou hast thy will: My gods abandon me, and thine idols stand In my soul's sanctuary, defiled and cold. Yet what is left me but to love thee still, Though thou hast made Love wingless, and my hand A bloodless tool, and I in bonds grow old? V.—PRIMITIÆ. SCENES FROM THE MASQUE OF PSYCHE. PART FIRST. [A woodland glade. Morning. A group of youths and maidens gathering flowers and twining garlands for a festival. Euphorion as Chorægus.] CHORAL HYMN. I. Ye bashful nymphs, coy-footed, that in woods Do hide your sunny faces, Sleeping long summer days in shady places, Or laving your white limbs in secret floods! Ye Dryads, which do nightly leave your bowers, To foster the wild flowers, And swell the myriad buds of pleasant June Beneath the moon: Suffer us that we sully once again, With mortal steps profane, Your verdurous wildernesses; We come to twine once more our festal wreaths, Here where dim jasmine breathes, Shaking the dew-drops from her starry tresses. II. O dainty-handed Dryads, be not chary Of any flowery treasure; grudge us not Briar-roses pink, or freckled fritillary; Or pale wood-lilies, filling many a plot With innocence and light; shy violets, Peeping about grey roots of agéd trees; Or meshed in leafy nets, The purple glory of great passion-flowers; Ope the intricacies Of tangled clematis and woodbine bowers: Deny us no frail branch of eglantine; No myrtle-rods, odorous with silver blooms; No cassia-buds, nurturing in their white wombs Unravished spice; no clump of columbine, To grace the wreaths we twine! Euphorion.— Cease, gentle friends, your several industry, Hot-handed day drives out the meek-eyed morn, Whose dewy fingers touched the sleeping lawns With freshness, and awoke each herb and flower, In wold or lea, by lake or woodland stream, To tell its dream of fragrance. Now all winds Roused by the dawn, their wanton gambols done, Fly forth to bear into the haunts of men The greeting of the woods; blithe-noted birds Have sung their earliest anthem, and begin Their foraging; through all their leaves the trees Stir with the new life of the coming day. Phœbus rides high, and sheds from sunny skies Our noon of festival; the hour draws on When, with deft rhythm of foot and cunning of voice, We celebrate the beauteous majesty Of fairest Psyche—many-altared Psyche— That mortal goddess for whose maiden shrine These garlands chaste we wreathe. Away, sweet friends, And as we hasten on our path, bid stir The mirth and melancholy of the strings, And let our wedded voices tunefully Vie with sky-searching pipe and amorous flute In free lark-hearted music. Come, sweet friends! CHORAL HYMN. I. For her! For her! The song, the dance, the pomp, the flower-decked shrine, The Orphic and the Bacchic din, the stir Of wind in sacred shells—our half-divine Psyche—for her, to worship whom the stars Pause in their golden cars! II. Tell us, ye Muses, was there ever any Of mortal strain before, So proudly throned above the beauteous many Whom Gods and men adore? Stooping from out the silence where ye dwell, Tell us, ye Muses, tell! III. None, none: not she, even she Who glowed her life out in the Thunderer's arms,— Great-hearted Semele; Not she, to drain the ocean of whose charms Three nights he held the sun at dreadful pause; Not Delian Leto, rescued from the jaws Of the pursuing Python; nor not any Of all that beauteous many Who stirred Apollo to celestial heat; Nor she whom fear made fleet— That coy Arcadian nymph beloved of Pan, Transfigured as she ran: None is her compeer, none, Rivalling with her, durst face the eye of the sun! [Exeunt.] [An enchanted Palace full of all manner of deliciousness. Psyche asleep. Voices of invisible spirits.] CHORUS OF SPIRITS. (Rising and falling like gnats on the wing.) Spirits of air! Spirits of earth! Spirits of water! Spirits of fire! Hither, hither, We flock together, Gathering, hovering everywhere. Spirits of beauty, of death and birth, Strengthening our adopted daughter For the shock of her heart's desire. Fondly above her We gather and hover; Sad thoughts that cling to her Fly as we sing to her, Murmuring cooingly, Tenderly, wooingly— Wake from thy dreaming! Psyche, sweet Psyche, awake to reality, Snatched from the mansions of yearning mortality, Shows of false-seeming! Pysche (awaking) —Wake I, or sleep? Or have the wings of Death Ravished me hither? O, methought but now, My mother's tears undried upon my cheek, My father's kiss warm on my lips, I stood In victim splendour on the dreadful mount, Alone with terror! Yet were Death my bridegroom, These roses would have paled at his cold kiss, These limbs chilled at his touch. This is the robe, These are the very jewels I put on To face the worshipping crowd who lackeyed me To heaven-ordained abandonment. The pulse Of comfortable life throbs in this frame, Not unsubstantial like a meagre ghost's, But warm with flesh and blood. O Love, Love, Love, Why leaps thy name to my tongue? Delight and dread Take each a hand, and lift me to my feet. Trembling I breathe Elysian atmosphere, Instinct with mystic odours, and alive With tenderest-whispered sounds. What sings in my ear? CHORUS OF INVISIBLE SPIRITS. (Preceding Psyche as she moves.) To the palace of our king We welcome sing; In these realms of light serene, Hail Psyche! Thou art Queen! Hungerest thou for mortal bread? Thou shalt have thy hunger fed With store of fruits of honied juices, Riped for the immortals' uses; They shall make thy languid flesh Like Hera's fair, like Hebe's fresh. Eat and fear not; only so Thou shalt see, and thou shalt know! (She plucks and eats of the enchanted fruit.) Dost thou thirst as mortals thirst? Lo! this fountain's vintage nursed Infant Bacchus royally, Skin-couched beneath a sunny sky, Whoso drinketh straightway glows With the rich life of the rose. Drink, and thou shalt feel to-night, As the immortals feel, delight! (She drinks from a fountain.) Wilt thou bathe thy wearied limbs? See no speck of soilure dims This laver's brink of amethyst. Water not so pure hath kissed The breasts of Dian timorously. Fear not lest aught impure may spy Thy maiden bosom's snowy charms, When soft-dropping from thy arms Falls thy vesture to thy feet, And revealed thou standest, sweet As a lily-bud new blown, Shrinkingly on the glowing stone. Bathe, and feel through every pore, Love's radiance tingling more and more! (She bathes, and is, after bathing, by invisible hands apparclled in white and glistering raiment. Then the heavy curtains of a sumptuous pavilion are drawn aside, disclosing the marriage-chamber; the mighty columns of the aisles exhaling a solemn music, sonorous and sweet.) FIRST SEMI-CHORUS OF SPIRITS. Now the vast of night grows warm With the purposes of Fate! SECOND SEMI-CHORUS. Of the Essence and the Form The marriage shall be consummate! (Psyche enters the marriage-chamber.) FULL CHORUS. Hush! dare not to breathe his name, Written first in tongues of flame On the black Chaotic deep, At which Earth's great heart did leap. By the yearning that upsprings, By the fear this yearning brings, By the bliss that swallows fear, We own his presence! He is here! (The whole place becomes suddenly darkened as Eros enters; a tempest of triumphal music shaking the adamantine walls at his approach. He embraces Psyche, who shrieks with mingled joy and terror at his touch.) PART SECOND. [Paphos—the Bower of Aphrodeite.] Aphrodeite (entering) —Deceived! betrayed! O vengeance, vengeance, vengeance! Who is this mortal whose accurséd charms Have robbed my altars of their worshippers, Me of my son's allegiance? ‘Let but Psyche Be true to me, and, by the waves of Styx, She may defy the thunderbolts of Zeus!’ He takes the style of a primæval God, So bold he grows! I tremble at his frown. Speaks he the truth, as partly I conceive That truth it is, this wayward son of mine Is of the mighty race who lorded it Before the birth of Chronos. Be it so! ‘Let her be true!’ But how if she be false?— As false she shall be, if my tongue can teach Her siren sisters aptly how to sing: Already she begins to pine for them, To awe them with the splendour of her state. They are my votaries—they shall snare me yet Her unweaned soul, half-trustful of her lord, Unseen of her in those sweet hours of love Stolen in the secret midnight. They shall-move To dark suspicion her still mortal heart, Till, fearful of some monster in her bed, She seek to gaze upon the naked limbs Of Eros as he sleeps, and, prying fool, Perish in fact of sacrilege. Away! Swift to my brooded vengeance, ere her womb, Quickening with fruit celestial, may atone The trespass of her eyes. Thus sealed her fate, Eros shines self-revealed—I strike too late! [Exit.] [The enchanted Palace of Eros, before the closed curtains of the Pavilion. Midnight. Enter Psyche with a torch. She pauses before the curtain.] Psyche.— One moment let me check my venturous hand, Trembling upon the deed, to still this heart Which makes a coward of me. Dost thou beat Thus audibly to warn me of some ill, In whose black train the Stygian multitude Of vampyre woes throng to lay waste the world? Is this the burden of thy fluttering song? (She draws a dagger.) Let me be firm. Thou deathful instrument, Gift of my sister's counsel—ah! (She lets it fall.) My bosom Is not so barren-grown of tenderness As to achieve my sad deliverance From this too sweet enchantment murderously. Can happiness, with evil mated, live In such unhallowed bridal? Do they know That I am thus most monstrously abused, Clasping some loathéd nightmare to my breast In foulest love embraces nightly? Nay— They mock me in their envy—they have lied! Yet, O just Gods, how can I face their tongues, And say: Ye lie! What proven mail of truth Have I to fence me from their poisonous words? Doubt, like a hag, in her accurséd stream Has dipt my love and made it vulnerable. Then knowledge be my aid—for thus I solve, Daring the worst, all grim uncertainties, With eyes, not hands. (She draws the curtain, and discovers Eros asleep.) O Zeus! I faint for bliss! (She bends over him in a rapture. A spark falls on his limbs. He starts up and rises into the air, casting Psyche from him as he rises. She screams and extends her arms towards him imploringly. He pauses for a moment in his flight, and speaks.) Eros.— Traitress! but one sweet night of trial more, And I was thine for ever—thou hadst soared, Twinned with me in one fiery cloud of love, Straight to the empyrean. O farewell! Eros has lost his bride. Ah! Psyche, Psyche! Farewell, farewell! (He disappears. Psyche falls senseless. The whole palace dissolves into black clouds, which overwhelm her.) [Sunset. An open country. Enter Psyche with an ebon box containing the Beauty of Persephone.] Psyche.— Once more the gladness of the open heaven, And the soft fragrance of the evening breeze! How beautiful is this world! There Hesperus Looks from his lucid eyes tranquillity, Charming the plains to silence. All is peace— I breathe but peace; and yet how keenly all things Invade each delicate sense with a delight I never felt before. So breathed, so felt, Upon the bounds of day, Eurydice, And cried too soon: ‘I live again!’ Ye gods, Who have bid gape the adamantine doors Of Dis's realm to my weak siege, and led me— A new Eurydice—with trembling feet, From the sad Stygian coast; making my wreck My triumph, take, in this deep ecstasy, My thanks for all! Here, here, I have the casket, Fetched through the groaning labyrinths of hell, Through the Cimmerian darkness. I have stood By hell's all-dreaded Queen, even as a child Beside its mother; I have dared to gaze Into her awful eyes; and here I bring Her beauty for my dower, bestowed as freely As mothers give the jewels of their prime To a dear daughter! Cruel Aphrodeite! Thy hate drove me to seek a precious pearl In a most dangerous sea. From such a plunge Few divers have come back. I rise at last; But, tyrant Queen, thou shalt not have my pearl: Mine was the toil—be mine the gain. O Eros! Wilt thou not love me now, made beautiful With such tremendous charms? (She opens the casket; a vapour rises from it. She swoons. Enter Aphrodeite.) Aphrodeite.— Lie there for ever, Alive in loveless, hopeless death for ever! Is this the goddess that insulted me? This the great bride of Eros? Here, thou clod, Be this thy dower—thus, thus, I trample thee! (Spurns her with her foot. Enter Eros.) Eros.— Away, tempt not my wrath! Off instantly, Killer of love, joy-hating Aphrodeite! Away, I scorn thee to the depths of hell! Aph.— Eros! (She has vanished.) Eros.— Awake! arise! Now dawns our Spring of love, The crocus flowers of joy break out like fire O'er the fresh fields of life. My love, my bride; Much-suffering Psyche, wake! I breathe on thee. (She rises.) Psyche.— Eros!—'Tis thou? Eros.— 'Tis I—thine, thine forever— Forever I am thine, and thou art mine! O, we will fly through all the realms of space, Blessing and blest; each moment of our flight Fraught with its new eternity of love! Psyche.— O make me strong to bear this transport! Eros.— Come, Enter the seven-fold citadel of my love, In which I close thee—thus! (She throws herself into his arms.) My long-tried Pysche! Not all the treacheries of old Night again Shall tear thee from me! Psyche.— Utter rest of bliss! Eros.— All is accomplished. (They ascend.) MAY SUNSHINE. O pure delight, to wander forth to-day! It is the very depth of the mid-May, When, call it the late spring or early summer, The season is sweet. Of birds the latest comer Has ended the glad trouble of its nest: Blue eggs are warm beneath the thrush's breast, And in the hedges you may hear the cheep Of new fledged wrens—prey for the stealthy creep Of prowling puss. Sweet violets all are past; A month ago we plucked the very last That hid themselves among their long-drawn leaves: But while the haunter of the garden grieves For them and all those other tender things Which blossomed lavishly in earliest Spring's Yet virgin coronal, there comes a puff Of sun-begotten fragrance—just enough To speak a bed of wall-flowers, where great bees Revel, and butterflies by twos and threes Giddily whirl and sun their damp white wings. And here chaste lily-of-the-valley rings Faint perfume from her delicate bells. Queen roses Begin to ope. One languidly discloses The crimson richness of her bosom's bloom. What summer odours sleep within the womb Of these unopened buds clustering near! What splendid promise for the coming year In yonder snow of blossomed apple-trees, Where finches peck and twitter at their ease. Balanced on swaying boughs. One whets his beak Against the bark, then with a sudden tweak, Plucks at the very bosom of a flower, Scattering the petals in a rosy shower; But lo! a fat green grub is in his bill, So the wise gardener lets him peck his fill Unmurdered. I to-day keep holiday, In honour of this ‘merrie month of May,’ And mean to grasp all natural delights, And store them up in verse for winter nights; As bees store honey. Not a thing too mean For these my rhymes—too ‘common or unclean;’ For all things ope their hearts to him who loves The fresh leaf-language of the fields and groves, The mere delight of breathing the soft air Of meadowy lawns; who can find 'scape from care In a wood's innocent haunts of healthful ease, Respite from heart-ache in a mountain breeze, And then return refreshed, strung to his best, And nobler for his little space of rest. A meadow with its wealth of deepening grass, Which the cloud-shadows lazily overpass, Receives me from the garden—every blade Drinking the sunshine. Taller heads are swayed Noddingly o'er the sprouted green below, By little puffs of gusty wind, which blow The ruffling surface into silvery flaws. Above my head a rook pompously caws To two black friends, who pompously reply, As home to yonder noisy elms they fly, Where swings their stick-built city. All around Among the dandelions, golden-crowned Or silken-plumed, and in the daisied grass, Small birds, with impudent eyes like beads of glass, Flutter, bob up, and flutter down again, With busy chirpings—hunting, not in vain, For moths and insects which most harbour there; And one for wantonness chases through the air A butterfly, which scarcely seems to shun The rapid pounces of his foe; and one Is angered at the buzzing of a bee, And snaps at her right viciously; but she Booms off unhurt upon her task. In glee The swifts are shrieking, high in air, and wheeling On arrowy wings. My heart swells with a feeling Of most exuberant life—life, far and wide Diffused, and throbbing deep. The sunny side Of all this ancient, unshorn hawthorn hedge Whereby I skirt along the meadow's edge, Is bursting into flower. A wasp, in quest Of rotten wood to temper for her nest, Explores each cranny of the gnarled hedge-foot, Where faded violets clasp each knotted root, And ashen trunks shoot up with leaves unborn And clustered blossoms. In the sprouted corn Patrician rooks strut and talk politics To chattering daws and magpies, proud to mix In such august society. Yon slope Of pasture, where the daisies have full scope With buttercups and cowslips to prepare A path for June, is shadowed here and there With grand horse-chestnuts, holding high their thyrses Of pale magnificent blooms. The sunlight pierces Quite through those queenlike limes, charming their green Fresh foliage into depths of emerald sheen; And golden gleams fall slanting on the cows, Study for Cuyp or Cooper, as they browse The juicy verdure. In the illumined sky, Where the white-piléd clouds float softly by, A lark is somewhere singing, as if huge gladness Had filled his heart with an ethereal madness. Here in the cool of this sequestered lane The early spring seems half revived again, For violets linger late by the path-side, And tufted primroses, serenely-eyed, Peep up from mossy banks, where sunshine plays Fitfully with tree-shadows—slanting rays Strike through the beech-tops, tempered as they pass To a tenderer leafy light. This craggy mass Of upthrust rock is wreathed with delicate bells Of meek wood-sorrel, which in secret dells Spring fairies hang with dew. O it is sweet, This quiet spot where I have bent my feet! Sweet with faint vernal smells—sweet with May-light, Sweet with a sound of water out of sight, Filtering through roots of fern, with fairy fronds Quaintly uncurling—into little ponds Hidden in moss; or somewhere underground, Lullingly murmuring to the flowers around. Fresh is the beauty of this woodland glade, Where mid-leg deep among the whorts I wade, Startling wood-butterflies and new-born moths From every bush; or where the streamlet froths O'er an abrupt cascade, and gurgles down With bells of foam upon its waters—brown And clear as mighty ale by Odin quaffed In Walhalla, sunshine in every draught. The air is full of the loud song of thrushes And blackbirds. Unawares my footstep crushes Clumps of moist-rooted blue-bells, as I listen. The varnished leaves of the dark hollies glisten Among the light green of the underwood, Tangled round veteran oaks, whose trunks have stood Since Shakspeare's May-time. Hark! the cuckoos' note Swells afar through the grove, and seems to float To me from out the dreamland of the past. Ay me! the present fleets away too fast For one who all day long would love to lie Gazing in the sweet glimpses of the sky, Caught through the tree-tops—soothed by the soft cooing Of wood-quests, and the velvet bees pursuing Their flowery task. But soon the air grows chill, And I have yet to climb a stretch of hill Ere I can strike for home across the plain With easy conscience. In this old churchyard, Where the unsparing hand of Time has marred The rude inscription on each fall'n headstone, Yet gently touched the spot—that it has grown The solemner for it, I could grow one with rest. The sun has crowned the silence of the west With a pale glory—like the aureole Round a saint's forehead, when the parting soul Stands tiptoe for its flight. The wan light falls Upon the grey church porch, and ivied walls, And time-worn tower—transfiguring the place To something mystic in its dreamlike grace. The very nettles give a sense of peace; The simple weeds that feel the day's increase Through all their blood, upsprouting lush and rank Under the hedge—or crown yon brambly bank With branching umbels; the meek celandine; Ivy, whose leaves and clustered berries shine In the grave light; this speedwell at my feet, Seem all parts of a vision strange and sweet: Seen once and since forgotten—ages past, Now dimly understood. It could not last, That dreamy mood: the gleam has died away, The air grows cooler as the broadening grey Swallows the sunset; and the noisy caw Of homeward-flying rooks breaks through the awe That held my spirit—and now the earth appears Nought but the work-day world of smiles and tears. My day is ended! A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM. Titania.— Late, as his wont, to tryst comes Oberon, Tarrying till one sweet moonéd hour is gone, And lazy-rising stars are mounted high To gaze on our belated revelry. Oberon.— Reason the greater now being blithely met, We waste no moment more in vain regret. Place, my Titania, for thy tardy lord, And peace between us happily be restored. Sing, fairies, warblingly and soft; beguile From my love's lips one welcome-beaming smile. FAIRY SONG. I. Queen of all our elfin powers, Starlight mistress of the sprites Who tend the leaves and feed the flowers, And close day-wearied lids o' nights! Sovran lady of sweet sound, Born amid the crystal spheres, And hidden long deep underground, To rise and ravish mortal ears! Smile; our harps wake but for thee! Smile upon our melody! II. Speak, and at the word shall rise On the smooth sward fresh and green, In pomp of moonbright fantasies, The palace of our Fairy Queen. Opal lamps shall light thy throne, Rich with treasures of the sea, Great moths' gorgeous wings each zone Shall send to make thy canopy; And our native woods shall yield Their most luscious hoards, concealed From unhallowed mortal eyne. Wilt thou that we bring thee wine From spring-born cowslips thrice-distilled? Or heath-bells to the brim up-filled With sweetness guarded from the bee Through long summer days for thee? Or the honey-dew that lies Deep in the woodbine's nectaries? Or the blush of musk rose buds Opening secretly in woods? Or the wild-thyme's spiced perfume, Robbed from sun-loved flowers, whose bloom Carpets for fairies many a sod, Where foot of man hath never trod? Smile upon us as we sing Merrily in our gambolling Tripping featly in a ring. Oberon.— Enough! we build no bower for ourselves. To-night we fly to meet the merry elves Who dance upon the ripples of the stream, And in great water-lilies sway and dream, Lulled by the song of spirits in the moon; For on this night the festival of June Is holden where old Nilus swells the seas, And gracious shapes of gone mythologies Mingle in mystic measures on the strand, And all the kindly powers of the land Meet Ocean's huge, foam-nurtured progeny; And now at last the time is come, and we, The greenwood troops of Western Faerie, Neglected long, are summoned— Titania.— Not a foot Stir I on such summons! I sit mute Before these Ancient Ones, who claim as due Reverence from all whom they style parvenue! Oberon.— Titania, cease! The river sprites await Our coming, robed and ready in their state, To speed us on our airy way; for know That one more cycle dread, ages ago Appointed, is fulfilled; and now at last Our golden Summer, whose hope hath filled the past With Spring, flies hither with the morning star! To-night the spirits gather from afar, Where sits the Mother-Sphynx, whose awful eyes Look through the past to dim futurities, To hail his orbéd rising. When his beams' First silver trembles o'er the ocean streams, The winds of dawn shall breathe some wondrous change, And we no more, slaves of the moon, shall range. Up and away, Titania! Quit your rings, Ye jocund loiterers! Fairies, to your wings! A MOONLIGHT SONATA. I. ADAGIO. Calm deeps of beauty all this night of June Speak to the soul in music—mystic bars Of peace float downward from the clear-voiced stars, Among whom proudly walks the vestal moon: A spheric chorus crystalline—in tune With the fervid symphony, Half delight, half agony, That ever riseth up to heaven from earth and sea. Hark! to the cadenced murmur of the waves, Where kissed by loveliest light they ebb and flow Upon this pebbly strand, old Ocean laves, With music weird and low; Or rolled around their echoing caves, Send far into the night their deep adagio. Thus Ocean, in his passionate loneliness, Utters to wandering winds mysterious things, Unheeded as the poet when he sings Of dreams beyond his cunning to express. Prometheus-like, to him the fire from heaven Brings vulture yearnings: till he feels at length His wrestlings with despair, to whom is given A god's ambition with a mortal's strength. II. ALLEGRETTO. But where the moonbeams fall O'er the far-silvered sea, With a motion musical Dance the ripples restlessly, Like such a tremulous theme for chiming strings, As a mighty master flings Over the rolling chords that chase Each other through the tempest of his bass; A theme swept onward with divinest sleight, Weaving a tissue of delight, Quaint as the weft of some wild dream Where transient splendours blend in fitful gleam, Yet tender as the last faint light that lies Upon a western cloud, before it dies Into the mellow calm of Autumn's evening skies. III. MINORE. Now the gale is in the trees And stirs amid their boughs wild gusty melodies, Rising in passion by abrupt degrees— Dying, as of despair, in ghostly cadences; In cadences of sorrowing tenderness, (Like sighs from tearless hearts—to break at last) Seeming to mourn dead love with fond distress; Low requiems for the past, Suggesting thoughts, too sweet to be denied, And inward longings—never satisfied— Deep-cherished dreams divine, by friendship undescried; Opening to memory Still palaces, in whose dim-vista'd halls, Phantoms of childhood's joys float lingeringly, And childhood's laughter faintly echoing falls Softly, how softly, on the dreamer's ears, Till the full heart expands ineffably, Thrilled with strange hopes and vague foreboding fears, In a solemn ecstasy. IV. SCHERZO. Anon the freaksome wind hath gentler grown, And seeks the dale, his roughness all o'erblown: Lithe stems of earing wheat he whispers through, Or sports o'er moonlit meads begemmed with dew, Kissing the wild-flower on her trembling stalk; Then, stealing sly along a trellised walk, With blowing roses arched, he fans the beds Where summer lilies hang their dainty heads, And many a blossomed vase the lawn bestuds, There woos their odours from the chaliced buds, Filling with dim perfumes the garden's bounds, Perfumes that float like tender-breathéd sounds— Sweet as the pleading tones of love-lorn lutes, Soft as the mellow harmony of flutes: Now through the woven clematis he climbs, Or hides himself among the leafiest limes; Now with a pink he pauses to coquette, Or hovers o'er a plot of mignonette; Now wantons with a fountain's dancing spray Ere to fresh fields of joy he hastes away, To chase the clouds with many an airy prank, Or sigh himself to sleep upon a thymy bank. V. ANDANTE TRANQUILLO. Here in this peaceful glade, Sweet tryst for lovers 'scaped from envious walls, Where chastened light gleams through the trembling shade, There comes a soothing sound of waterfalls; And half you hope—so lovely looks the spot— To come on Oberon and his chivalry, Holding their revels in some quiet plot With bannered pomp of elfin pageantry; Or fair Titania laid in smiling sleep On mossy couch beneath her loved woodbine, Whose honied blossoms bend in fragrant twine Over their Queen; while quaint-clad courtiers keep Armed watch around her rest, and countless elves, In bells of foxglove merrily swing themselves, Or serenade some rose-rocked beauty near, With silvery harps and voices icy-clear. But now no fairy pomp is seen, No fairy music heard— Nought breaks upon the balmy night serene, Save that the glimmering leaves are gently stirred, Save that the brooklet murmurs through the dale: When on a sudden, hark! the nightingale Begins his song with soft melodious trill, Tender as moonlight, passionate as love— As though some spirit hidden in the grove Poured forth his soul with more than mortal skill. How plaintively it gushes from his throat, Blent with the water's dreamy undertone, Till with one liquid, long, delicious note It ceases—he has flown! VI. ANDANTE CON MOTO. A stonecast farther on The shadowy path winds slowly to a hill, And lo! a lake—the starbeams shimmer wan O'er all its bosom still; And through the throbbings of the dewy night A sound of city bells comes fitfully From yonder haze of labyrinthine light Seen dim against the sky. O there are mingled in fantastic strife All hopes, all passions—shaped by circumstance; This grim farce-tragedy of human life, Strange as a masquer's dance! VII. ADAGIO MISTERIOSO. These are the mystic voices of the earth Heard faintly in the night's sweet silence—these Her solemn utterance, rising since her birth In wild crescendos swept through minor keys; The music of her forests and her seas, As of a mighty organ loud and deep, Rolls up in full majestic harmonies, Blent with the tones of men who toil and weep: An awful strain, big with the agonies Of a sin-wasted world: but through it peal Strong chords of aspiration, which reveal Undaunted wrestlings—quenchless energies. Thus earth's grave song, unmarked by mortal ears, Swells the grand chorus of the sister spheres. POESY; RHAPSODIA. I. Spirit of beauty, hail! Thou that dost haunt still glen or sunny lea, Or in the forest, Dryad-like, dost dwell, That comest in the whisperings of the gale Or 'mid the thunder-music of the sea, Or with the fragrance of the thymy dell: O Spirit, which art one with Nature all, On thee I call! By the unfathomed mysteries Hid in thine ethereal eyes; By their serene, heart-healing spell, Dowered with virtue to make well The wounds of life, to banish sadness, And fill the breast with tremulous gladness; By thy sceptre that can raise Solemn pageants of old days; And scare the ghosts of our dull night With glimpses of to-morrow's light, I do conjure thee, stoop to me, Daughter of heaven and earth, flute-voicéd Poesy! II. Come, waft me with thee in thy dreamy car, Far from this mental treadmill of the desk, And from the babbling, bustling world afar, To where the oak flings wide his boughs grotesque Over some lonely stream: Some quiet stream, some lilied woodland stream, Warbling strange wood-songs o'er its pebbly bed, Its waters, glad with many an amber gleam, By sunshine mellowing through the boughs o'er-head To nectar turned. Here let me lie 'mid fern And balmy grass, breathing the fresh wood-smells, And over-waved by woodbine, while I learn The fairy lore rung out from foxglove bells. Here let me drink the silent utterings Of the beautiful wild things That round me peer and climb, buzzed o'er by bees Which singing labour; ere I pass from these, Over all space and time to fly with thee, Joy-giving Poesy! Ere from out the golden chalice, At the pearl gates of thy palace, I quaff the rich, fire-hearted wine, That makes mortals half-divine, And inherit uncontrolled All the godlike bards of old Ever sung or ever told. III. First let me range that mythic world Of phantasy, when smoke upcurled From many an altar reared to Jove, And haunted was each stream and grove With shapes of beauty of immortal mould: In that unfabled age of gold When the poet's heart was young, And all men poets, and there clung Round visible things a mystery Of unperturbed infinity. IV. Suddenly I am rapt from out the real, To the crystal sphere of the ideal! Hark! 'tis the golden lyre of young Apollo, Whom in a mystic dance the Muses follow; Or Artemis, her huntress Oreads Rousing the echoes of the still wood-glades, Under a crescent moon; or wine-flushed Bacchus, Drawn royally by his leopards—conquering Bacchus, With all his rout of followers, ivy-crowned, And wild Bacchantes—leaping to the sound Of clashing cymbals, tossing cups of gold And waving thyrses. Then, deep in some old And sacred forest, wakes a silver din Of shalms and shrill sweet pipes, and out and in Among the tree-boles dart a merry clan— The train of Pan! And white-limbed wood-nymphs shriek among the boughs, Pursued by lusty satyrs, till the brows, The rugged brows, of Pan himself appear; And forth the pageant issues, and such a clear And jubilant shout goes up of ‘Pan! Pan! Pan!’ As was ne'er heard by man. Anon the car of foam-born Aphrodeite Comes surging through the spume, urged by the mighty Arms of a triton throng—a pearly car Of opal hues, wherein glows like a star The goddess in her new-born nakedness Of rose-flushed beauty—to the silver stress Of Nereid harps, and deep sea-sounding horns By sea-gods blown—such as on summer morns Boom landward with the tide. And round her throng, Sporting amid the spray, and oared along By their white-ankled feet with gleeful ease, The Oceanides: The snowy tossing of their gleaming arms, And multitudinous, billowy bosoms, charms The ruffled waves to rest. Green-eyed sea-snakes, With diamond coils that leave far-flashing wakes, Follow behind. But hark! the whelming thunder Crashes above. Black storm-clouds, rent asunder By angry lightnings, swallow up the scene. The deep moans to the tempest. Icy keen Fierce north-winds rushing down with frost and snow Rave through the shrieking forest. In their woe The gentle spirits of the earth cry out; Aloft upon the blast a demon rout Ruffians it through the spaces of the sky, And from the deep shudders an awful cry: ‘The throne of Zeus is fallen!’ V. Fled are those visions. O ye woods, no more The abode of Dryads! O ye woodland streams No more nymph-haunted! O thou ancient shore, No longer peopled by the poet's dreams, Farewell! Yet hast thou larger joys for me Star-crownéd Poesy! VI. The golden gates are oped—I see Bright shapes of Gothic chivalry; Hear afar weird trumpets blown, Catch the minstrel's wizard tone, In lofty words of glad acclaim Resounding each heroic name, And I breathe a dim perfume Of old romances. Grandly loom Sunned spaces of enchanted land, With misty peaks on either hand, Full of dreadful sounds and voices When the fiend-raised storm rejoices; Castles and palaces and towers Of another world than ours, Such as happy dreamers spy At sunset in the western sky; And stretched away, the cliffs between, Forests dark and meadows green, Where flowers that medicine lovers' woe, And herbs of stellar virtue grow; Magic meres and haunted lakes, And rivers where a dragon slakes His hissing thirst; and everywhere Gallant knights and ladies fair,— Waving plumes and pawing steeds, Lovely words and doughty deeds. Now slow pass before mine eyes Long pomps and gorgeous pageantries, With standards royally unrolled,— Flash of jewels, blaze of gold, Purple and crimson blazonry; But o'er the silken sheen I see Still stern faces of great kings, And the keen steel music rings Through the gleaming play of pearls On the round white arms of girls— Each, her champion's thronéd queen, On the tourney gazing keen, While below, 'mid shivering lances, Lovers strive for gentle glances. Then the sunshine waxeth dim, And a deep sonorous hymn Peals through a cathedral's aisles, Where the Virgin-Mother smiles Placidly on the blessed Babe; And, each cross-legged on his slab, Lie the calm cold effigies; And on quaint-wrought traceries, Pillared niche, and blazoned wall, Rich melodies of colour fall From the splendours of the pane Where crownéd saints and martyrs reign In sacred pomp and high romance; And cowering devils peep askance From carven phantasies of stone; And long candle-flames are blown Flaringly by the balm-sick air, Which makes the banners pendant there, Faded memories of the brave, Warm with perfume as they wave, While the censer smokes and swings; And a mystic sweetness clings To robes of prostrate worshippers, Prince and peasant; and none stirs, For the Host is held on high; But round the hallowed place a sigh Of dumb adoration steals. Low before the altar kneels A mailed and purpled Emperor; All the thunderbolts of war Vailed—a shadowy pretence, Before the Church's dread magnificence. VII. Fled, they too fled, fond shapes of youth's delight, Their glamour faded from the workday world! What lamp of joy shall glorify the night Wherein they sink? O yet, thy wings unfurled For mightier flights, thy stern eyes comfort me, Strength-bringing Poesy!</field>
