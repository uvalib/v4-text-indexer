The prologue generall of Paule Busshe/composytour of this lytell treatyse. Deum timete/et regem honorificate. Prima Petri secundi. In an orcharde as I walked/desolate of c?pany In a pathe/from tre to tre/as my vsage was Unbrede with bowes penda?t/in order plesauntly In mynde I reuolued/howe I might br?g to passe Some treatise to endyte/to the conforte and solace Of people desyrous/vertuously to be occupyed To se god lauded/and his hye name magnifyed. And as I walked alone/in mynde thus musyng I thought to endyte/what thyng were necessary And by long delyberacion/I c?iectred most sytt?g Somwhat to write/of mans ingratytude &amp; folly And to ?secute his demeaner/all croked &amp; c?trary To god his maker/by lyueng nat c?mendable Subdued by vyce/and suche maters semblable. And no great marueyle/ne wonder certayne Though suche inc?uenyence/enshewe vs amonge For wylfully is broken/the bridell and the rayne Whiche shulde gouerne man in euery thronge As first/drede is expulsed/by audacite stronge And sensualyte ruleth/as gouernour principall So that Christ is nat dradde/ne feared at all. Also ?fyte loue/whiche shulde deuout myndes Sette on fyre/in louyng god omnypotent Is subpeditate/by enormytes of sondrie kyndes Wherfore I thought it semyng/and most c?ueny?t As touchyng my purpose/for this tyme present Of these two maters/and their circ?sta?ce chefely Somwhat to write/to mittygate suche folly. And also to speke/I thought it expedient Thirdly of ignor?ce/which ledeth people froward Shewyng them by auctorites/&amp; reasons euydent Howe they are oblygate/in especiall regarde Their prince to honour/as capten of their forward Whose magnanimyte/they ought to auaunce With hertes and goodes/after their substaunce. Of these maters thre/as god wyll dispose I entende this volume/shall beare thimportaunce And as breuely/as I can/in meter compose I shall discribe/as my wyttes can forge vttraunce Their grades &amp; dist?ctions/their pro?tis &amp; eliga?ce Rebukyng in especiall/wylfull rashe audacite &amp; also blynde ingratitude/which man ought to fle. That gostly champion/saint Peter the apostell In his epistels/this sentence ofte dothe resight Feare you god he saithe/this is his counsell And loke ye honor your pr?ce/with power &amp; might In his iuste tytell/alway redy for to fyght Thus shall you please god/&amp; your soules decorate Whan y? heed with the m?bres/togider be adunate. What causeth mischefe? what causeth disc?cion? Discorde and debate: But onely disobedience Thus olde hystores and scripture/maketh m?cion For it is counted a lyfe brutall/euer saithe sapience Whan that people lyueng/dothe nat their dilyg?ce God chefly to worship/and their prince to honour As the thyng speciall/of their corporall treasour. What caused cyties and townes to fall to ruyne: But onely the decayeng/of Christes hye honour Whan y? people to vyce/them selfe dyd fully enclyne Somtyme the Romayns/habounded in treasour But whan christ? honor decayed/&amp; they fell to error Than their renome abated/vrged by violence For their vnstable demeaner/to kepe true sylence. Manyfolde presyd?tes/reduce we may to memory Cotidially shewed of mannes vnstable dotage Waueryng as the wynde/laboring right busely For honour and worship/as one of hye lynage Clyming so hye/that forgoten is their parentage ye/god and his prince/and hymselfe also Whiche after subuerteth his state/to sorowe &amp; wo. Well this set clene aside/I shall my wittes aua?ce My purpose to comprice/and therto my pen direct No lengar to remayne/by goddes gouernaunce In maters dependyng/nothyng to theffecte Eschewing wordes su?flewe/which oft doth infect The sentence clere/of hystores true &amp; autentycall Lefte for morall presydentes/to people vnyuersall. But in mynde whan I pondre/this prouerbe olde Who casteth lesse peryls/th? dothe bayarde blynde It maketh my hande quake/and also my hert colde And tosseth my wyttes/as a ship before the wynde Lest some frowarde persons/peruert and vnkynde Shulde by me reporte/wordes somwhat e?ualent Sayeng/to enterprice suche causes/he is insuffici?t. Such say?g may be verified y? dede maketh relaci? Wherfore to my maisters/knowyng the quiditice Of scolasticall artes/by practyse and speculacion I submyt my selfe/in most humble wyse Their due correction/in no case to dispyce But as a discyple/leanyng to doctryne So vnto their tradicions/gladly I shall enclyne. But the correction I refuce/and that in especiall Of a wandring mynstrell/or of a rusty coke Of a iester/a rayler: or of a barbaryke rurall Or of any suche other/knowyng no letter in boke The trouthe to say/nat an A/from a fysshe hoke And after myne opinyon/it is greatly vnfyttyng That suche shulde haue/suche maters in h?dlyng. But yet though suche chatte/as dothe the Pye And fynde many fautes/for lacke of intellection yet that shall nat cause me to omyt my study But to kepe ydelnesse/in bonde and subiection Suche pastyme wyll I vse/vnder the protection And the diuyne suffra?ce/of god omnypotent As to my state/is most syttyng and conuenyent. C?mendacion it is none/this I knowe certayne A relygious man/to ydelnesse to be obedyent Nor the laude is but small/vyle and mundayne His tyme to c?tryue/in discribing workes insolent For to suche thynges/if he do his mynde frequent Wysemen shall say/deprauyng his fame This man gothe about/to lese his good name. Therfore my lordes and maisters in generall Pondre the entent/ of my enterprise rude For the thyng y? ?uoked me/to this worke speciall My study to apply/with dilygent solycitude Was that slouthfull idelnesse/shulde nat me illude And y? I maye acc?plysshe/my purpose and entent First shall I pray/as it is most expedient. Nowe lorde/as thy sapience surmo?teth m?s estimacion In rulyng &amp; gouernyng/by prouid?ce inc?parable Heuyn/erthe/and hell/as doctors make relacion So nowe rule my penne/and my wytte variable That my worke be nat fo?de/fauty ne yet culpable But fartell of goodnesse/garnysshed with vertue Uice vtterly to repell/&amp; gostly fortitude to renue. Also helpe me lorde/of thy goodnesse hab?da?t Directly to procede/in this matter compendyous My style to adorne/with sentence plesaunt That to the reders/gredy and desyrous It may be profytable/and also c?modious Their hertes to enflame/alwayes pondring God to drede/and to honour their kyng. Thus endeth the prologue of Paule Busshe/c?positour of this worke/and begynneth the first treatyse/whiche speketh of the drede &amp; feare that euery man ought to haue to off?de almighty god. Venite filij audite me, timorem domini docebo nos.
